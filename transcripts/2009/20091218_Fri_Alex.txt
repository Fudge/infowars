[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.295]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:05.683]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:28.385]  We are simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv and live in color for all the radio listeners that wish to tune in on the web, not just to audio, but to the live video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:32.186]  Coming up, health care bill wouldn't bring real reform.
[00:00:32.627 --> 00:00:42.331]  Howard Dean says he's getting ready to get somebody to run against Obama in 2012, because he knows Obama is going to be out of there.
[00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:44.552]  This is the third
[00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.500]  Administration of George W. Bush.
[00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:52.682]  Obama is a colossal hoax.
[00:00:53.422 --> 00:00:55.743]  He's as big a hoax as man-made global warming.
[00:00:56.224 --> 00:00:58.665]  He's as big a hoax as WMDs in Iraq.
[00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:01.346]  This isn't about partisanship, left or right.
[00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:02.627]  It's about the truth.
[00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:17.035]  And if you're a socialist who really wants government health care, you're a well-meaning liberal that wants to help people that don't have health care, you have to be against this bill.
[00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.985]  Because it's, as Dennis Kucinich said, it is nothing but a corporate rip-off.
[00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:24.950]  It raises your taxes and cuts your benefits.
[00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:26.393]  And it puts you in prison.
[00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:30.893]  I mean, it's so un-American, it makes my head spin.
[00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:32.054]  So unconstitutional.
[00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:42.542]  Now, I'm against free healthcare, because there's nothing that's free in this world, and it gives government control over your life, and any big government system turns into a rip-off.
[00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:48.306]  Because only big, powerful, financial interests can come in and move the levers of government.
[00:01:48.787 --> 00:01:53.550]  So, any big government is always going to burn you, and is always going to be a fraud.
[00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:55.472]  That is the nature of it.
[00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:57.554]  It is like a law of gravity.
[00:01:58.234 --> 00:01:59.975]  Or the law of thermodynamics.
[00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:02.057]  Or the law of cause and effect.
[00:02:02.217 --> 00:02:03.818]  It is a law!
[00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:05.560]  Not a theory!
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.721]  Big government is hell!
[00:02:09.123 --> 00:02:10.163]  People want solutions?
[00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:11.184]  Cut government!
[00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:18.570]  Instead, Obama has spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:21.712]  Now, the buck doesn't stop with Obama.
[00:02:22.153 --> 00:02:26.356]  I've told people, in Obama deception and fall of the republic, he will be politically destroyed.
[00:02:27.415 --> 00:02:28.816]  And then everything will be blamed on him.
[00:02:29.256 --> 00:02:32.917]  And then the next puppet will come in, and everything will be blamed on that puppet.
[00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:38.739]  Please, ladies and gentlemen, look past the little puppets dancing in front of you, to the person pulling the strings.
[00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.180]  Bernanke.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.440]  Summers.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.841]  Geithner.
[00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:44.081]  Rubin.
[00:02:45.502 --> 00:02:46.362]  The Rothschilds.
[00:02:46.402 --> 00:02:47.242]  The Rockefellers.
[00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.704]  And finally, the real elite is being revealed.
[00:02:50.844 --> 00:02:54.125]  Now, in Copenhagen,
[00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:11.018]  The meeting is in trouble because Africa, Asia, and Latin America have discovered that it's massive taxes paid directly to the IMF and World Bank from the Third World and the First World, the developing and the developed, to be paid to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:03:11.978 --> 00:03:13.159]  The UN has no control.
[00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:18.181]  Even if you trust the UN, it's going to the IMF and World Bank, who are even worse.
[00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:20.322]  They're the progenitors of the UN.
[00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:23.204]  It's nothing but a holding front for them.
[00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.206]  George Soros is involved.
[00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.160]  Global taxes.
[00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:32.423]  Global GDP taxes.
[00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:35.546]  Global taxes with a global authority over all money transfers.
[00:03:35.886 --> 00:03:37.007]  That's what's in the treaty.
[00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:38.769]  Go to Infowars.com.
[00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.210]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:42.332]  Go over the documents.
[00:03:42.793 --> 00:03:44.314]  Go over the latest treaty.
[00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:46.156]  Paul Watson's written an article about it.
[00:03:46.397 --> 00:03:47.578]  He has links to the treaty.
[00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:51.631]  Don't believe me.
[00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:52.912]  Read this for yourself.
[00:03:53.192 --> 00:04:19.359]  Then when you see Obama up there talking about how war is peace and how this is a great deal for the third world and how America's bad and has to pay its debt, that's meant to sell the left and America bashers on, oh, we're going to get behind this when it's actually genocide to their countries and is actually meant to target them and destroy the development of their industrial capacity.
[00:04:20.563 --> 00:04:23.224]  And as a death sentence, just the U.S.
[00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:31.989]  and Brazil shifting to 30% of their cornfields to ethanol doubled world food prices and killed an extra 10 million people from starvation.
[00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:33.430]  Normally it's 15 mil.
[00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.191]  It was 25 mil.
[00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:37.012]  Those are conservative estimates.
[00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:38.352]  You think about 10 million people.
[00:04:39.253 --> 00:04:44.956]  I know Stalin said that one person's a tragedy, 10,000's a statistic, but you wrap your mind around that.
[00:04:45.596 --> 00:04:46.557]  You let that sink in.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:56.902]  Now in this segment and the next few, I'm going to play Obama's speech today in Copenhagen, the final day of the official world government event.
[00:04:56.922 --> 00:05:05.924]  I mean, that's what Ban Ki-moon calls it, that's what Van Rompuy calls it, the head of the EU, head of the UN, Schwarzenegger calls it that, David Rothschild calls it that.
[00:05:06.284 --> 00:05:08.985]  No more denial, private world government.
[00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:14.026]  So I'm going to play Obama and briefly stop him and cover each lie.
[00:05:15.626 --> 00:05:18.207]  Here is Obama today in Copenhagen.
[00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.952]  It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nations around the world.
[00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:35.977]  We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave and growing danger to our people.
[00:05:37.618 --> 00:05:42.561]  All of you would not be here unless you, like me, were convinced.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.082]  Now, that's about 30 seconds of it, let's go over the lies.
[00:05:49.122 --> 00:05:55.748]  He says, all of you leaders are here, you all agree that climate change is a grave and deadly threat and is really happening.
[00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:57.870]  That's a complete fraud.
[00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:11.361]  More than 50 of the delegates of the 190 plus that are there, on record have said they are questioning Climategate and the official story, and a bunch of world leaders from those countries are questioning it, and that's on record.
[00:06:12.517 --> 00:06:16.060]  You know, the President of the Czech Republic, countless others, the Russians, you name it.
[00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:19.964]  The Japanese, the Chinese, the Indians.
[00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:21.826]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:06:22.546 --> 00:06:23.287]  So that's a lie.
[00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:26.951]  You're all here, you all agree, and you all agree it's a grave danger.
[00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:31.415]  And notice it's not global warming now, because things are getting colder, naturally.
[00:06:31.555 --> 00:06:33.317]  It's global change.
[00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:34.978]  Change is not normal.
[00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:36.620]  The seasons are not normal.
[00:06:38.308 --> 00:06:40.011]  Okay, so let's continue.
[00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:45.919]  Unless you, like me, were convinced that this danger is real.
[00:06:47.642 --> 00:06:49.084]  This is not fiction.
[00:06:50.246 --> 00:06:50.847]  It is science.
[00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:52.009]  Hit pause.
[00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:55.313]  This is not fiction, it is science.
[00:06:55.454 --> 00:07:08.605]  When the main UN university in England that produced the key documents and the head scientist for the IPCC, Santer, separately from ClimateGate, now admits, as of Wednesday on national US television,
[00:07:09.653 --> 00:07:17.175]  This is huge news that he took out five areas of the report where the UN's own scientist said, man is not causing this.
[00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:19.476]  The final report, they cut it out.
[00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:24.557]  Of course man can't do anything near the sun or anything near the moon.
[00:07:26.118 --> 00:07:29.539]  And the tidal changes from the moon?
[00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:32.740]  The amount of gases exchanged by all of that water moving?
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.221]  I mean, that alone, the moon is unbelievable.
[00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:37.901]  But the sun dwarfs it.
[00:07:43.206 --> 00:07:43.926]  It's just incredible.
[00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:46.007]  All of it is lies.
[00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:46.747]  Continue.
[00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:47.627]  Unchecked.
[00:07:48.547 --> 00:07:57.010]  Climate change will pose unacceptable risks to our security, our economies, and our planet.
[00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.050]  Hit pause.
[00:08:02.831 --> 00:08:04.312]  Unacceptable risk.
[00:08:04.772 --> 00:08:08.053]  You have the UN caught fixing the data.
[00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:13.778]  This is the same thing when he talks about this is not a fiction, this is science.
[00:08:14.138 --> 00:08:18.379]  That's like Al Gore talking about how he invented the internet.
[00:08:18.739 --> 00:08:19.440]  Total lie.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.802]  Or Al Gore saying polar bears can't swim and are all dying when their numbers have more than tripled in the last 50 years.
[00:08:25.082 --> 00:08:25.842]  Official numbers.
[00:08:27.803 --> 00:08:32.445]  That's like Bill Clinton saying, I did not have sex with that woman.
[00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.546]  Or Richard Nixon saying, I'm not a crook.
[00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:37.066]  Or George Bush Sr.
[00:08:37.106 --> 00:08:38.147]  saying, read my lips.
[00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.911]  It's a lie!
[00:08:41.332 --> 00:08:42.132]  It's a lie!
[00:08:44.614 --> 00:08:53.441]  So he's saying this is science, this is fact, you can't question when their scientists have been proven in premeditated fraud.
[00:08:54.582 --> 00:09:03.189]  Here's a guy saying pay taxes to a private global corporation, the World Bank and IMF, or the seas are going to rise and you're going to drown.
[00:09:03.449 --> 00:09:03.930]  Back to it.
[00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.351]  This much we know.
[00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:12.745]  The question then before us is no longer the nature of the challenge.
[00:09:14.377 --> 00:09:16.518]  The question is our capacity to meet it.
[00:09:16.798 --> 00:09:17.298]  Hit pause.
[00:09:17.798 --> 00:09:20.399]  See, he just keeps saying, everyone knows, everyone knows.
[00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:21.299]  It's not a question.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.320]  It's a fact.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.160]  We know the facts are in.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.341]  You've got to do what I say.
[00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:26.021]  It's a fact.
[00:09:26.141 --> 00:09:26.681]  It's a fact.
[00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:27.261]  It's a fact.
[00:09:27.642 --> 00:09:34.684]  A total con man, just a slick Harvard lawyer con man, running a scam on the dumb public.
[00:09:35.364 --> 00:09:37.545]  Well, the dumb public woke up to your scam, buddy.
[00:09:37.565 --> 00:09:38.245]  Let's go back to him.
[00:09:39.526 --> 00:09:43.127]  For while the reality of climate change is not in doubt,
[00:09:45.003 --> 00:09:45.744]  I have to be honest.
[00:09:46.164 --> 00:09:46.504]  There you go.
[00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:47.324]  Hit pause again.
[00:09:47.344 --> 00:09:50.026]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'm trying to play this.
[00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:51.387]  We're not even two minutes into it.
[00:09:53.008 --> 00:09:56.090]  He says, while the reality of climate change is not in doubt.
[00:09:57.111 --> 00:09:58.972]  I guess in a lawyer's speak, that's true.
[00:10:00.092 --> 00:10:01.733]  The climate is always changing.
[00:10:01.773 --> 00:10:06.256]  Just like on Mars, the ice caps were getting smaller the last 50 years.
[00:10:06.696 --> 00:10:09.038]  Suddenly, the last five, it started getting bigger again.
[00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.753]  Because the sun just cooled off.
[00:10:13.093 --> 00:10:14.474]  That's why it's gonna get colder here.
[00:10:14.834 --> 00:10:23.181]  I mean, it's not a conspiracy theory, folks, that if you stand in front of a fireplace, it heats your hands, and that the sun heats up and cools off.
[00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:25.022]  It oscillates.
[00:10:25.502 --> 00:10:26.083]  In cycles.
[00:10:26.423 --> 00:10:28.565]  In 21-year cycles, in 11-year cycles.
[00:10:31.144 --> 00:10:35.729]  I mean, ancients worshipped the sun because they knew it created the heat.
[00:10:35.929 --> 00:10:37.851]  The UN said on Monday, no, it's not the sun.
[00:10:37.912 --> 00:10:39.713]  The sun has no effect!
[00:10:40.334 --> 00:10:41.796]  That's Associated Press headline.
[00:10:43.695 --> 00:10:44.415]  In fact, Google that.
[00:10:44.576 --> 00:10:46.637]  UN says sun has no effect on climate.
[00:10:46.697 --> 00:10:49.319]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, penguins can swim.
[00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:51.040]  Their numbers are up.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.421]  Polar bears can swim.
[00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:53.482]  They hunt on the ice flows.
[00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:54.282]  They're not grounding.
[00:10:54.522 --> 00:10:56.324]  The sun is what mainly drives climate.
[00:10:56.344 --> 00:11:00.967]  I don't know how many climatologists and astrophysicists I've got to have on to explain that.
[00:11:01.447 --> 00:11:09.773]  But when somebody tells you the sun isn't involved in the temperature, ladies and gentlemen, this planet would be below zero
[00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:16.684]  And would be hundreds of degrees below zero in days if the sun went out.
[00:11:18.306 --> 00:11:19.988]  We would be as cold as Pluto.
[00:11:20.768 --> 00:11:26.654]  Pluto, I forget, is... Pull up the temperature of Pluto, it's something like thousands of degrees below zero.
[00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:29.016]  You know why?
[00:11:29.436 --> 00:11:33.520]  Because it's thousands of times further out from the sun than our planet is.
[00:11:36.323 --> 00:11:36.643]  Look at that.
[00:11:36.723 --> 00:11:38.285]  No sun leak to climate change.
[00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:39.046]  BBC.
[00:11:39.446 --> 00:11:42.068]  I just... How dumb do they think we are?
[00:11:42.729 --> 00:11:46.052]  I'm gonna come back and try to go through this, but he said nobody's questioning.
[00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.375]  Nobody's... No one's questioning climate change.
[00:11:50.096 --> 00:11:50.816]  You heard it from him.
[00:11:50.996 --> 00:11:52.037]  That's another lie!
[00:11:52.057 --> 00:11:56.982]  31,000 scientists sent him a petition saying they wanted to talk to him.
[00:11:57.563 --> 00:11:57.763]  I mean...
[00:12:00.217 --> 00:12:00.698]  Attention!

[00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:07.232]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:13:07.492 --> 00:13:13.277]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:13:13.577 --> 00:13:16.279]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:22.445]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:13:22.805 --> 00:13:24.225]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:13:24.385 --> 00:13:26.666]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:32.267]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy, and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:13:32.487 --> 00:13:34.308]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:13:34.568 --> 00:13:35.968]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:13:36.328 --> 00:13:38.588]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:13:38.849 --> 00:13:43.209]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.950]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.371]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:51.832]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:13:52.292 --> 00:13:52.953]  One last time.
[00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.934]  It's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:13:59.296 --> 00:14:03.178]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:07.561]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.062]  You get less for your money.
[00:14:09.262 --> 00:14:15.125]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:15.185]  800-686-8000.
[00:14:17.026 --> 00:14:17.666]  That's right.
[00:14:40.011 --> 00:14:40.331]  Thank you.
[00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:02.494]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:15:02.854 --> 00:15:04.695]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:05.575]  Don't!
[00:15:06.015 --> 00:15:09.037]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:15:09.457 --> 00:15:16.480]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.121]  's number one debt secret.
[00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:22.103]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:15:22.503 --> 00:15:25.245]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:32.691]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:34.033]  Herb K. was right.
[00:15:34.213 --> 00:15:37.295]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.416]  What have you got to lose?
[00:15:38.756 --> 00:15:41.959]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:43.120]  Get Herb K.'
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.142]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:46.703]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:15:50.846 --> 00:15:51.126]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:16:15.828 --> 00:16:18.249]  Okay, let's continue with Obama.
[00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.931]  So he just said, no one questions climate change.
[00:16:21.732 --> 00:16:22.552]  Another lie.
[00:16:22.572 --> 00:16:23.853]  I mean, you know that's a lie.
[00:16:24.213 --> 00:16:29.896]  Even if you believe polar bears can't swim, penguins can't swim, the sun doesn't warm the earth, has nothing to do with it.
[00:16:30.237 --> 00:16:31.757]  You just saw the UN say so.
[00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:39.102]  You can fry eggs outside on the cement in July in Texas, but nothing to do with the sun.
[00:16:39.422 --> 00:16:41.943]  That heat's coming up from a grill underneath the concrete.
[00:16:42.684 --> 00:16:44.185]  Okay, even if you believe that.
[00:16:45.427 --> 00:16:48.669]  You know scientists are questioning man-made global warming.
[00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.710]  You know that's a lie.
[00:16:51.271 --> 00:16:52.672]  Now let's go back to his lordship.
[00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:53.932]  Here's Obama at the UN.
[00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:55.473]  ...is not in doubt.
[00:16:57.314 --> 00:17:06.600]  I have to be honest, as the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt right now.
[00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:09.682]  And it hangs in the balance.
[00:17:12.704 --> 00:17:14.145]  I believe we can act boldly,
[00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.853]  And decisively, in the face of a common threat.
[00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:25.499]  That's why I come here today, not to talk, but to act.
[00:17:33.006 --> 00:17:41.173]  Now, as the world's largest economy, and as the world's second largest emitter,
[00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:45.586]  America bears our responsibility.
[00:17:47.695 --> 00:17:50.756]  Okay, so now there's a bunch of America bashing.
[00:17:51.276 --> 00:17:52.877]  We're the second biggest polluter.
[00:17:52.937 --> 00:17:57.858]  China's passed us last year of putting out the most carbon dioxide.
[00:17:58.358 --> 00:18:05.680]  Let's not stop them from putting lead, mercury and melamine in the baby milk and in the medicines and the foods and all the crud they ship over here.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.620]  Let's not have China stop that.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.121]  Let's have them stop putting out carbon dioxide.
[00:18:10.141 --> 00:18:12.682]  But wait, they don't have to make cuts under this agreement.
[00:18:13.202 --> 00:18:13.862]  Only we do.
[00:18:14.835 --> 00:18:17.316]  And so more of our industry will move there.
[00:18:18.836 --> 00:18:24.078]  But here he is, in front of the UN, in front of all these countries, bad-mouthing his own country.
[00:18:24.198 --> 00:18:25.058]  Back to Obama.
[00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:31.560]  America bears our responsibility to address climate change.
[00:18:33.141 --> 00:18:35.642]  And we intend to meet that responsibility.
[00:18:37.142 --> 00:18:42.904]  That's why we've renewed our leadership within international climate change negotiations.
[00:18:44.005 --> 00:18:48.274]  That's why we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.
[00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:49.056]  Alright, hit pause.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.922]  What that means is, hey, the U.S.
[00:18:53.142 --> 00:18:55.644]  is run by the private banks, and the U.S.
[00:18:55.684 --> 00:18:57.005]  has funded the world government.
[00:18:57.085 --> 00:19:03.410]  We've been sucked dry to fund this, and we're intensifying our funding to buy all you third world countries off.
[00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:11.976]  And most of you presidents and prime ministers and parliament heads, you've all gotten giant cash payments from us to sell your people out.
[00:19:12.077 --> 00:19:13.177]  So you've been bought.
[00:19:13.558 --> 00:19:14.679]  So you deliver.
[00:19:15.459 --> 00:19:24.103]  You deliver cutting off the resources and fossil fuels to your millions of people, many of which are living on the edge of starvation, and millions of which do starve.
[00:19:24.383 --> 00:19:30.886]  You kill your people for the New World Order, because that's what Dutch Rochelle and the Queen of England and David Rockefeller want.
[00:19:31.247 --> 00:19:32.527]  That's the translation there.
[00:19:32.787 --> 00:19:33.548]  Back to Obama.
[00:19:34.468 --> 00:19:41.932]  That's why we've taken bold action at home, by making historic investments in renewable energy, by putting our people to work
[00:19:42.907 --> 00:19:45.108]  Increasing efficiency in our homes and buildings.
[00:19:45.128 --> 00:19:45.729]  Ah, head pause.
[00:19:45.949 --> 00:19:46.529]  More lies.
[00:19:46.729 --> 00:19:52.292]  They always candy coat their global taxation grid in electric cars, windmills, things that sound reasonable.
[00:19:52.712 --> 00:19:56.614]  But really, even those are boondoggles given to their select friends and buddies as payoffs.
[00:19:56.934 --> 00:19:57.875]  That's coming out in the news.
[00:19:58.255 --> 00:19:59.536]  So that's an inside scam.
[00:20:00.456 --> 00:20:19.990]  And then they use all that fake environmentalism to block out real environmental action, real environmental controls, like genetic engineering and things that are truly dangerous, nanotech, CERN reactors, superconducting super colliders, a lot of these super advanced technologies the Pentagon admits they're messing around with antimatter.
[00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.751]  That's in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:25.914]  Oh, let's not have any real controls on stuff that really is dangerous!
[00:20:27.605 --> 00:20:29.206]  Let's just, hey, you're for the future.
[00:20:29.266 --> 00:20:30.527]  You're for renewable energy.
[00:20:30.807 --> 00:20:32.027]  You know, you care, don't you?
[00:20:32.047 --> 00:20:33.888]  We're going to go out to break with Obama.
[00:20:34.129 --> 00:20:37.751]  I'm going to come back and comment on what he had to say and finish up on the other side.
[00:20:38.051 --> 00:20:38.631]  Stay with us.
[00:20:38.711 --> 00:20:39.412]  Back to Obama.
[00:20:39.752 --> 00:20:46.115]  By pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform to a clean energy economy.
[00:20:47.816 --> 00:20:54.020]  These mitigation actions are ambitious and we are taking them not simply to meet global responsibilities.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.261]  We are convinced
[00:20:57.412 --> 00:21:07.375]  As some of you may be convinced, that changing the way we produce and use energy is essential to America's economic future.
[00:21:08.236 --> 00:21:15.818]  That it will create millions of new jobs, power new industries, keep us competitive, and spark new innovation.
[00:21:17.338 --> 00:21:24.861]  We're convinced, for our own self-interest, that the way we use energy, changing it to a more efficient fashion,
[00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:33.498]  is essential to our national security because it helps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
[00:21:34.499 --> 00:21:38.002]  It helps us deal with some of the dangers posed by climate change.
[00:21:39.823 --> 00:21:45.208]  So I want this plenary session to understand America is going to continue on this course of action.
[00:21:49.772 --> 00:21:52.675]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.673 --> 00:21:56.435]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:58.936 --> 00:22:03.178]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:22:03.498 --> 00:22:07.561]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:07.821 --> 00:22:13.244]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:13.584 --> 00:22:18.867]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:19.187 --> 00:22:19.728]  Number 3.
[00:22:20.008 --> 00:22:23.290]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:27.333]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:22:27.514 --> 00:22:28.054]  Number 4.
[00:22:28.314 --> 00:22:30.676]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:34.459]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:34.759 --> 00:22:34.959]  Number 5.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.463]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:22:39.683 --> 00:22:44.447]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:22:44.727 --> 00:22:48.772]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:48.892 --> 00:22:50.474]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:50.694 --> 00:22:52.777]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:22:52.957 --> 00:22:55.300]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:23:00.575 --> 00:23:04.216]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:23:04.536 --> 00:23:12.677]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:23:13.397 --> 00:23:17.438]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:23:18.038 --> 00:23:28.840]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:38.482]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:23:38.982 --> 00:23:44.043]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:51.605]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:23:51.905 --> 00:23:54.646]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:23:59.815 --> 00:24:03.477]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:24:03.837 --> 00:24:06.839]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:11.862]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:24:11.882 --> 00:24:18.125]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:24:18.265 --> 00:24:20.507]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:24:21.027 --> 00:24:21.327]  Tim Geithner?
[00:24:21.347 --> 00:24:21.767]  Bernanke?
[00:24:21.847 --> 00:24:22.628]  They're arsonists!
[00:24:22.668 --> 00:24:23.788]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:24:23.808 --> 00:24:26.049]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:24:39.955 --> 00:24:41.797]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:24:42.077 --> 00:24:46.921]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:24:47.221 --> 00:24:57.170]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:04.537 --> 00:25:05.658]  So now Obama
[00:25:07.148 --> 00:25:12.872]  Word for word says what Lord Christopher Monckton yesterday on this radio show said he would say.
[00:25:13.372 --> 00:25:14.633]  Word for word.
[00:25:14.653 --> 00:25:18.936]  When I watched this live early this morning, my mouth was hanging open.
[00:25:19.597 --> 00:25:20.818]  I mean, word for word.
[00:25:21.538 --> 00:25:22.499]  We must do this.
[00:25:22.579 --> 00:25:24.060]  It's a historic global agreement.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.921]  You're part of this.
[00:25:24.961 --> 00:25:26.281]  Your children are watching.
[00:25:26.782 --> 00:25:27.983]  You've got to do this.
[00:25:28.043 --> 00:25:30.885]  We've had all these years of inaction, which isn't true.
[00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:37.111]  They're taking over the counties and cities through the bureaucracies of all the nations, including the United States especially.
[00:25:39.554 --> 00:25:43.558]  All the different sub-regions, depending on how governments break that down in their federal systems.
[00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:46.081]  They are already implementing all this.
[00:25:46.622 --> 00:25:48.604]  You know about all the green taxes you're already paying?
[00:25:48.884 --> 00:25:49.625]  None of it's green.
[00:25:49.685 --> 00:25:50.386]  It's a robbery.
[00:25:51.363 --> 00:25:54.726]  So let's go back to Obama as he says, we've got to do this.
[00:25:55.446 --> 00:25:56.667]  It's historical.
[00:25:58.248 --> 00:26:01.471]  And then he goes on to say, even if you don't sign on, the U.S.
[00:26:01.511 --> 00:26:02.451]  is going to fund this.
[00:26:03.212 --> 00:26:11.158]  And that will just be private money to the IMF to go into round two of paying off other countries that they've already got under debt.
[00:26:11.518 --> 00:26:14.180]  This is their new way to get even more debt and more control.
[00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:15.321]  Here's Obama.
[00:26:16.282 --> 00:26:19.925]  To mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy economy,
[00:26:21.462 --> 00:26:29.544]  No matter what happens here in Copenhagen, we think it is good for us as well as good for the world.
[00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:38.487]  But we also believe that we will all be stronger, all be safer, all be more secure if we act together.
[00:26:40.134 --> 00:26:40.915]  So there you have it.
[00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:44.677]  They're going to make the climate cuts here, which is even better for them in phase one.
[00:26:44.817 --> 00:26:48.380]  Just like the big, famous steel mill that just closed in England.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.342]  The government paid them millions of pounds, millions of U.S.
[00:26:51.382 --> 00:26:54.124]  dollars, to shut down and move to India.
[00:26:55.265 --> 00:26:56.706]  With no emissions controls.
[00:26:57.166 --> 00:26:58.447]  That's environmentalism.
[00:26:58.767 --> 00:27:07.193]  So even if you believe that polar bears can't swim and that carbon dioxide that plants breathe is a deadly poison, this is going to produce more of that deadly poison.
[00:27:07.353 --> 00:27:07.674]  Here it is.
[00:27:08.769 --> 00:27:19.395]  That's why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agree to certain steps and to hold each other accountable to certain commitments.
[00:27:23.438 --> 00:27:38.007]  After months of talk, after two weeks of negotiations, after innumerable side meetings, bilateral meetings, endless hours of discussion,
[00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:45.495]  Among negotiators, I believe that the pieces of that accord should now be clear.
[00:27:47.637 --> 00:27:59.046]  First, all major economies must put forward decisive national actions that will reduce their emissions and begin to turn the corner on climate change.
[00:28:02.129 --> 00:28:13.862]  Even if you believe the UN's own Cook numbers, all of our evil carbon dioxide may increase the temperature by one degree and may make the seas rise between 7 and 20 inches.
[00:28:14.082 --> 00:28:14.382]  Nothing.
[00:28:15.217 --> 00:28:15.357]  That's
[00:28:36.914 --> 00:28:39.536]  I'm pleased that many of us have already done so.
[00:28:39.556 --> 00:28:42.038]  Almost all the major economies have put forward
[00:29:06.798 --> 00:29:07.739]  Legitimate targets.
[00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:09.320]  Significant targets.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.380]  Ambitious targets.
[00:29:11.861 --> 00:29:20.007]  And I'm confident that America will fulfill the commitments that we have made, cutting our emissions in the range of 17% by 2020 and by more than 80% by 2050 in line with final legislation.
[00:29:20.027 --> 00:29:20.207]  Second,
[00:29:28.171 --> 00:29:36.074]  We must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments and exchange this information in a transparent manner.
[00:29:36.394 --> 00:29:36.994]  Hit pause.
[00:29:38.255 --> 00:29:39.515]  That's the global government.
[00:29:40.016 --> 00:29:49.219]  Just like they attack your country if you try to build your own nuclear reactors, or if you try to have your own central bank, they will attack you over your carbon emissions.
[00:29:49.879 --> 00:29:53.881]  They will put sanctions on you and then, yes, physically attack you.
[00:29:55.011 --> 00:29:57.653]  These measures need not be intrusive or infringe upon sovereignty.
[00:29:57.673 --> 00:30:01.815]  They must, however, ensure that an accord is credible and that we're living up to our mutual obligations.
[00:30:01.835 --> 00:30:02.836]  Without such accountability,
[00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:25.746]  Any agreement would be empty words on a page.
[00:30:27.607 --> 00:30:36.171]  I don't know how you have an international agreement where we all are not sharing information and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments.
[00:30:36.732 --> 00:30:37.252]  Hit pause.
[00:30:38.153 --> 00:30:40.434]  And that was a satellite blip from recording it.
[00:30:41.094 --> 00:30:42.735]  A TV blip from Denmark.
[00:30:42.755 --> 00:30:43.696]  We didn't edit anything.
[00:30:44.096 --> 00:30:45.497]  You can read the transcript for yourself.
[00:30:45.957 --> 00:30:50.219]  And there he's saying you've got to have a global institution to enforce this agreement.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.140]  Back to it.
[00:30:54.602 --> 00:30:55.462]  That doesn't make sense.
[00:30:57.283 --> 00:30:58.823]  It would be a hollow victory.
[00:31:01.384 --> 00:31:12.488]  Number three, we must have financing that helps developing countries adapt, particularly the least developed and most vulnerable to climate change.
[00:31:14.168 --> 00:31:19.110]  America will be a part of a fast start funding that will ramp up
[00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:24.493]  Okay, stop right there.
[00:31:27.755 --> 00:31:30.097]  They say they're going to help the third world.
[00:31:30.918 --> 00:31:34.901]  All these are IMF World Bank loans backed up with Western tax money.
[00:31:35.421 --> 00:31:46.430]  And the loans are given, this was going on in 73, under State Department memorandum 200, where Kissinger's talking about, we give them loans to sterilize their women and to cut off food.
[00:31:47.031 --> 00:31:49.153]  And in the future, you won't get
[00:31:50.217 --> 00:31:52.638]  Loans unless you cut the amount of food you eat.
[00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:54.679]  This is eugenics.
[00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:56.460]  This is population reduction.
[00:31:58.201 --> 00:31:59.221]  Let's go back to the video.
[00:32:01.222 --> 00:32:10.046]  Hillary Clinton, my Secretary of State, made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize $100 billion in financing by 2020.
[00:32:11.446 --> 00:32:18.309]  If, and only if, it is part of a broader accord that I've just described.
[00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.270]  Alright, pause again.
[00:32:21.638 --> 00:32:29.381]  What he's saying there is, I'll give $100 billion to the third world, but we'll do it in 2020, 10 years after we're taxing you for carbon.
[00:32:31.802 --> 00:32:33.023]  Do you understand what that means?
[00:32:35.684 --> 00:32:38.325]  Alright, let's go ahead now and go back to the clip.
[00:32:40.946 --> 00:32:45.968]  Mitigation, transparency, financing.
[00:32:47.589 --> 00:32:48.469]  It's a clear formula.
[00:32:49.787 --> 00:32:57.313]  One that embraces the principle of common but differentiated responses and respective capabilities.
[00:32:58.895 --> 00:33:00.716]  And it adds up to a significant accord.
[00:33:01.637 --> 00:33:06.441]  One that takes us farther than we have ever gone before as an international community.
[00:33:09.484 --> 00:33:15.829]  I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time.
[00:33:18.308 --> 00:33:23.690]  And at this point, the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart.
[00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:28.452]  Whether we prefer posturing to action.
[00:33:31.153 --> 00:33:37.036]  I'm sure that many consider this an imperfect framework that I just described.
[00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:40.117]  No country will get what it wants.
[00:33:41.717 --> 00:33:47.640]  There are those developing countries that want aid with no strings attached.
[00:33:48.407 --> 00:33:49.568]  Okay, that's another lie.
[00:34:05.816 --> 00:34:08.077]  We've got the Copenhagen Treaty.
[00:34:08.477 --> 00:34:13.939]  They're upset because they were told they didn't have to make cuts and the first world did, that they were going to get tax money.
[00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:27.865]  Now they learn they have to make cuts almost double, not quite double, almost double what the West has to make and that the IMF and World Bank will be collecting all this money and keeping it for themselves and the third world knows how corrupt those institutions are.
[00:34:30.106 --> 00:34:35.388]  So here he is, like he's the arbiter between the first world and the third world and the developing world.
[00:34:36.513 --> 00:34:41.497]  You know, he's the arbiter when he clearly is a representative of the Anglo-American New World Order.
[00:34:41.857 --> 00:34:42.638]  Let's go back to him.
[00:34:42.898 --> 00:34:56.748]  For those advanced nations who think that developing countries either cannot absorb this assistance or that will not be held accountable effectively and that the world's fastest growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden.
[00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:05.175]  We know the fault lines because we've been imprisoned by them for years.
[00:35:09.432 --> 00:35:17.158]  Energy, cheap energy has allowed humans to grow and has lifted a lot of people out of poverty.
[00:35:17.498 --> 00:35:22.542]  He's now saying cutting people's energy off is cutting their bondage off.
[00:35:23.762 --> 00:35:32.709]  Meanwhile, governments actually try to block real technological development and in this treaty it says the UN will decide what new technologies can be funded and developed.
[00:35:33.709 --> 00:35:35.231]  So it's also a new dark age.
[00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:36.351]  Let's go back to it.
[00:35:39.346 --> 00:35:44.171]  These international discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades.
[00:35:46.693 --> 00:35:57.243]  And we have very little other than an increased acceleration of the climate change phenomena.
[00:35:59.646 --> 00:36:01.908]  The time for talk is over.
[00:36:03.971 --> 00:36:05.892]  This is the bottom line.
[00:36:07.173 --> 00:36:08.514]  The time for talk is over.
[00:36:08.554 --> 00:36:09.675]  You're not allowed to talk.
[00:36:10.176 --> 00:36:11.276]  You're not allowed to debate.
[00:36:12.677 --> 00:36:15.299]  Everyone agrees the Earth is dying from CO2.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.940]  But everyone doesn't agree.
[00:36:17.841 --> 00:36:20.623]  So if everybody agrees, why is the time for talk over?
[00:36:21.444 --> 00:36:23.705]  See, we have to hurry and do this right now.
[00:36:24.226 --> 00:36:25.186]  Finishing up with Obama.
[00:36:26.627 --> 00:36:27.488]  This is the bottom line.
[00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:29.470]  We can embrace this accord.
[00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.352]  Take a substantial step forward.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.921]  Continue to refine it and build upon its foundation.
[00:36:38.442 --> 00:36:42.363]  We can do that and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic endeavor.
[00:36:43.183 --> 00:36:46.144]  One that makes life better for our children and our grandchildren.
[00:36:48.465 --> 00:36:51.686]  Or, we can choose delay.
[00:36:52.366 --> 00:36:52.926]  There you go.
[00:36:53.066 --> 00:36:53.586]  Hit pause.
[00:36:54.047 --> 00:36:54.747]  Well then that's just...
[00:36:55.919 --> 00:36:57.380]  Two-year-old level psychology.
[00:36:57.941 --> 00:37:01.464]  You don't care about your children and grandchildren if you don't give in to this.
[00:37:02.144 --> 00:37:12.573]  When in truth, cutting off the fossil fuels of the third world, in their own Club of Rome documents, the State Department memorandum 200, is meant to kill people en masse by starvation.
[00:37:12.953 --> 00:37:15.675]  Which is how Mao Zedong did it, and how Stalin did it.
[00:37:15.935 --> 00:37:20.179]  This is a death sentence, and Obama knows full well what he's doing.
[00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:22.301]  That's why he's the brown face on this.
[00:37:22.901 --> 00:37:26.544]  ...hoping to sucker the third world into their own death sentence.
[00:37:26.864 --> 00:37:29.427]  That's why he was put in power, was to sell this.
[00:37:29.687 --> 00:37:32.769]  That's why he was given the Nobel Peace Prize, to sell war.
[00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.970]  That war is peace.
[00:37:34.311 --> 00:37:35.251]  Back to the fraud!
[00:37:35.692 --> 00:37:40.436]  ...falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way of action for years.
[00:37:41.597 --> 00:37:51.065]  And we will be back having the same stale arguments, month after month, year after year, perhaps decade after decade,
[00:37:52.438 --> 00:37:56.781]  All while the danger of climate change grows until it is irreversible.
[00:38:01.885 --> 00:38:03.566]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's no time to waste.
[00:38:05.327 --> 00:38:06.548]  America's made our choice.
[00:38:07.549 --> 00:38:08.809]  We have charted our course.
[00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:10.411]  We have made our commitments.
[00:38:10.751 --> 00:38:11.852]  We will do what we say.
[00:38:13.493 --> 00:38:20.017]  Now I believe it's the time for the nations and the people of the world to come together behind a common focus.
[00:38:20.037 --> 00:38:20.678]  Stop right there!
[00:38:21.758 --> 00:38:27.464]  That's why Obama has told the Senate and the House, I don't care if this doesn't get ratified.
[00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:31.108]  I'm going to implement this by command and control.
[00:38:31.128 --> 00:38:32.890]  Remember that on Monday from the White House?
[00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:35.552]  Totally unconstitutional.
[00:38:35.592 --> 00:38:36.533]  He's not a dictator.
[00:38:37.374 --> 00:38:38.816]  But that's why he said that.
[00:38:39.456 --> 00:38:40.758]  Obama said that.
[00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:46.400]  Because he's been given his orders, the die is set, the U.S.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.041]  has to be the sacrificial lamb.
[00:38:48.501 --> 00:38:54.083]  China, India, Mexico, and a hundred plus other third world countries, they're not going to make any cuts.
[00:38:54.923 --> 00:38:55.503]  The U.S.
[00:38:55.543 --> 00:38:57.004]  is going to sign on to the agreement.
[00:38:58.346 --> 00:39:09.689]  Europe's going to sign on and we're going to have our taxes raised to give more money to the IMF and World Bank to go buy off the third world, the third world leaders, to murder their people by starvation.
[00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:10.829]  Real simple.
[00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:15.470]  And that's what's covered in eco-science written by the White House science czar.
[00:39:17.611 --> 00:39:18.431]  That's their plan.
[00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:20.471]  They want to get rid of people.
[00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:26.733]  And there's a lot of you out there that think it's the received knowledge that we've got to reduce world population and that it's the right thing to do.
[00:39:28.257 --> 00:39:30.019]  Well, you go ahead and kill yourselves then.
[00:39:30.299 --> 00:39:38.086]  Do not sit there and have a death sentence to these little African children and Latin Americans and Asians and others, and then see American standard of living dropped.
[00:39:40.909 --> 00:39:43.731]  There's tens of millions of Americans on subsistence right now.
[00:39:44.011 --> 00:39:47.615]  There's people that freeze to death every year in this country, having their power turned off.
[00:39:49.485 --> 00:39:55.807]  This is genocide for all you people that have been sold on this being cutesy and cute by the corporate media.
[00:39:56.007 --> 00:39:57.748]  You know the corporate media is death!
[00:39:58.368 --> 00:40:00.388]  What are you doing being sold by this?
[00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:01.929]  Wake up!
[00:40:01.969 --> 00:40:03.109]  Stop being schmucks!
[00:40:03.449 --> 00:40:04.570]  Stop being fools!
[00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.590]  Stop being idiots!
[00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.051]  Let's finish up with Obama, then I'm skipping this break.
[00:40:09.071 --> 00:40:10.031]  We're going to Robert Wannick.
[00:40:10.071 --> 00:40:10.451]  Go ahead.
[00:40:11.792 --> 00:40:14.233]  We are ready to get this done today.
[00:40:15.293 --> 00:40:16.553]  We're ready to gut America right now.
[00:40:16.573 --> 00:40:18.514]  There has to be movement on all sides.
[00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:24.353]  To recognize that it is better for us to act than to talk.
[00:40:26.454 --> 00:40:39.623]  It's better for us to choose action over inaction, the future over the past, and with courage and faith, I believe that we can meet our responsibilities to our people and return to our planet.
[00:40:39.863 --> 00:40:40.503]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:42.785 --> 00:40:44.366]  I mean, what a load of bull.
[00:40:44.466 --> 00:40:48.909]  So that's my breakdown of his 10-minute, 40-minute, 10-minute, 40-second speech.
[00:40:51.363 --> 00:40:55.605]  And it just, I could talk for 10 hours about what he's discussing.
[00:40:55.625 --> 00:41:00.646]  I could spend an hour on each minute going through, showing the evidence of how it's all frauds.
[00:41:01.227 --> 00:41:05.848]  But why should I have to show evidence when they say the sun doesn't affect temperature on the earth?
[00:41:06.348 --> 00:41:09.810]  When they say penguins and polar bears can't swim and are all drowning?
[00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:15.312]  Or when they say the ice caps would be gone by this year, three years ago, and they're getting bigger?
[00:41:16.286 --> 00:41:18.768]  Or, and they say, any climate change is abnormal.
[00:41:19.168 --> 00:41:24.012]  It's nothing but scaremongering to accept world government run by a private banking system.
[00:41:24.433 --> 00:41:25.413]  Alright, I'm done ranting.
[00:41:25.433 --> 00:41:28.296]  We've only got 10 minutes with Robert Wannick, who's been persecuted.
[00:41:28.976 --> 00:41:34.641]  We'll be rolling video in the background without audio of his YouTube video where he describes this.
[00:41:35.742 --> 00:41:39.485]  Robert Wannick, great 9-11 truth activist, great patriot.
[00:41:40.746 --> 00:41:44.809]  He is in high school and
[00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:57.596]  He's won one of our postering contests before, and this time he got expelled for handing out the actual inserts that show you what's really in the flu vaccine.
[00:41:57.656 --> 00:42:02.480]  They admit there's mercury, it can cause Guillain-Barré, brain damage, neurological disorders, cancer.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.362]  They don't want that being handed out.
[00:42:04.582 --> 00:42:10.086]  So he's trying to warn fellow students in his off time, at school, and this is what happened to him.
[00:42:10.407 --> 00:42:14.390]  Robert Wannick, tell us again where you're hailing from and exactly what happened to you.
[00:42:15.097 --> 00:42:17.137]  Well, thanks for bringing me on today, Alex.
[00:42:17.817 --> 00:42:20.238]  I attend school in Breckenridge, Minnesota.
[00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.138]  I attend Breckenridge High School.
[00:42:22.838 --> 00:42:28.900]  And every Wednesday, we have a group meeting of classes called Connection.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.961]  Last Wednesday, we were given forms to receive our H1N1 vaccine on Wednesday the 16th.
[00:42:35.741 --> 00:42:42.502]  I decided it'd be a great idea if I'd fill out one of these forms and attend the clinic to educate others of the possible risks.
[00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:48.077]  Which a school should actually promote self-education of students.
[00:42:48.797 --> 00:42:49.838]  No, you're a prisoner.
[00:42:49.878 --> 00:42:50.939]  You're not allowed to do that.
[00:42:50.979 --> 00:42:57.202]  You're to keep your mouth shut and only in super maxes are you not allowed to talk to the other prisoners.
[00:42:57.463 --> 00:42:58.683]  So you're in a super max.
[00:42:59.204 --> 00:43:00.244]  Exactly what's happening.
[00:43:00.805 --> 00:43:09.470]  So first step that was taken was my principal called my mom and asked her if she had signed this H1N1 form knowing that I'm
[00:43:09.986 --> 00:43:14.309]  So they were already watching you and didn't know why you were agreeing to do it?
[00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:15.790]  Well, that's what wardens do.
[00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.491]  You know, he's doing his job as a warden.
[00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:18.352]  Go ahead.
[00:43:40.393 --> 00:43:46.855]  Yeah, you're like somebody in Tuskegee, Alabama going and warning blacks not to be injected with syphilis.
[00:43:46.895 --> 00:43:49.556]  So, you're a serious thought criminal.
[00:43:49.636 --> 00:43:54.897]  You're going to talk to people who are about to have a medical experiment done on them.
[00:44:08.469 --> 00:44:09.030]  Absolutely.
[00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:12.732]  So my principal was at the door and he said, Robert, you can go sit down.
[00:44:12.752 --> 00:44:14.953]  So I went and sat down next to a nurse.
[00:44:15.274 --> 00:44:22.738]  As soon as she told me to roll up my sleeve, I stood up and said, attention, I just want to hand out some information about vaccine risk.
[00:44:23.599 --> 00:44:30.223]  I only got a few flyers out before my principal came up, rammed his hand into my lower back and started forcing me towards the door.
[00:44:30.844 --> 00:44:31.824]  I said, don't touch me.
[00:44:31.844 --> 00:44:32.405]  I'm leaving.
[00:44:32.705 --> 00:44:34.166]  He said, I'm just escorting you out.
[00:44:35.287 --> 00:44:36.487]  I was out of the room within 30 seconds.
[00:44:38.393 --> 00:44:47.240]  But I decided that I couldn't go back to class yet if these kids had no clue what they were putting in their bodies, so I decided to address the line.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:57.548]  So I handed out about 30 flyers, one to each kid in line except for the science teacher's son, who refused one, and many of them started dispersing and leaving the line.
[00:44:58.217 --> 00:45:06.222]  Others just said, you know, I have a choice and... I mean, this is real rebellion against tyranny, but the science teacher kid... I'm a scientist.
[00:45:06.342 --> 00:45:08.964]  I don't look at what's in the vaccine.
[00:45:08.984 --> 00:45:09.705]  Hmm.
[00:45:10.965 --> 00:45:12.627]  I trust my Soviet government.
[00:45:12.667 --> 00:45:13.047]  Go ahead.
[00:45:14.028 --> 00:45:20.414]  Yeah, and so these students started leaving and moments later I heard a student from inside the vaccine room say, I have a choice.
[00:45:20.594 --> 00:45:21.575]  I don't want it anymore.
[00:45:21.915 --> 00:45:22.716]  I'm not going to get it.
[00:45:23.156 --> 00:45:30.903]  So they didn't even know they had a choice because all over the country it's come out they are forcibly inoculating mainly elementary students because they don't know.
[00:45:31.613 --> 00:45:37.555]  And the funny part about it was the nurse actually tried to almost tell him that it was, um, it was mandatory.
[00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:38.336]  Excuse me?
[00:45:38.516 --> 00:45:38.936]  Excuse me?
[00:45:38.976 --> 00:45:39.616]  What did you hear?
[00:45:40.216 --> 00:45:41.857]  I heard him say, I don't want it.
[00:45:41.897 --> 00:45:42.657]  I'm not going to take it.
[00:45:42.677 --> 00:45:44.218]  And she said, your parents signed a form.
[00:45:44.598 --> 00:45:45.258]  You have to take it.
[00:45:45.278 --> 00:45:46.399]  And he said, I'm not taking it.
[00:45:46.959 --> 00:45:49.780]  And he walked out of the room and all you heard was the
[00:45:50.365 --> 00:45:53.907]  Public health officials trying to lobby his opinion to keep him in there saying that.
[00:45:53.947 --> 00:45:55.147]  But see, that's how this works.
[00:45:55.367 --> 00:45:59.849]  One person says no, and half the people in the line go, yeah, I don't want it either.
[00:46:00.169 --> 00:46:05.392]  They were just intimidated under the group psychology, the mob psychology, to do it.
[00:46:06.792 --> 00:46:16.817]  And then once these students started walking in with these printed off flyers, they started asking questions like, have you guys heard of this?
[00:46:16.937 --> 00:46:17.477]  And the nurses
[00:46:18.157 --> 00:46:24.540]  The nurses either wanted to take the flyers or get these vaccines done as quick as they could because every single student walked in with one.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:30.902]  That's when my principal emerged in the hallway with a law enforcement officer and said, go back to class, Robert.
[00:46:31.062 --> 00:46:36.004]  He yelled at me down the hallway, or I'll have you arrested and removed from school grounds.
[00:46:36.484 --> 00:46:38.505]  And I said, I know the policy.
[00:46:38.885 --> 00:46:40.406]  You can't just override the policy.
[00:46:40.426 --> 00:46:43.307]  The policy for being out of class is a detention.
[00:46:43.607 --> 00:46:47.849]  And I was more than willing to take a detention to get these flyers out.
[00:46:48.914 --> 00:46:55.255]  And then, after that, I decided I'd go back to class because I knew that they would ramp up the punishment.
[00:46:55.895 --> 00:47:02.657]  But at 1.30 is when my class ended and they announced, any teachers or faculty that want the vaccine, please report to the science room.
[00:47:03.197 --> 00:47:10.418]  So the bell rang and me and about five other students who are educated on the issue of vaccinations sprinted down to the science room.
[00:47:10.478 --> 00:47:11.979]  So you came back with cavalry.
[00:47:12.039 --> 00:47:13.059]  I bet they didn't like that.
[00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:17.740]  Now you're trying to warn the adults of the mercury and the cancer viruses.
[00:47:18.819 --> 00:47:26.086]  This time I came back with pricked-off articles of the 14-year-old student from Virginia who got Guillain-Barre Syndrome.
[00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:34.714]  And I started telling people about how the Wilkin County Public Health form the kids were given said there's no link to GBS.
[00:47:35.615 --> 00:47:41.441]  And this started raising eyebrows because I had an article that directly links the swine flu to GBS.
[00:47:42.116 --> 00:47:44.877]  But the public health official was not about to let me in.
[00:47:45.297 --> 00:47:51.498]  She actually pushed me as I was going in the door and then put one hand on each side of the door and said, you're not coming through.
[00:47:51.518 --> 00:47:53.298]  So I could not get in.
[00:47:53.838 --> 00:48:02.320]  But what I did was I ducked and slid under her arm into the vaccine room where some teachers were already being vaccinated.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:10.402]  I handed out about three or four flyers and the science teacher comes up to me and I said, just let me hand out flyers.
[00:48:11.483 --> 00:48:14.125]  You can get your vaccine, I just want to handle flyers, and then I'll leave.
[00:48:14.686 --> 00:48:18.369]  He grabs me, both hands by the shirt, and says, get out.
[00:48:19.169 --> 00:48:25.995]  And right now I had a student with a camera, just for protection, in case I would get assaulted.
[00:48:26.635 --> 00:48:34.782]  And he goes, puts his hands out, and says, I'm not assaulting you, and proceeds to ram me with his chest, to make it look like he's not assaulting me.
[00:48:35.142 --> 00:48:40.366]  And he rams me out the door, and he notices that there's a student out there that has a camera.
[00:48:41.058 --> 00:48:46.502]  He doesn't know if the camera's filming or not filming, but this obviously upsets him because he just broke the law.
[00:48:46.562 --> 00:48:47.783]  He just put his hands on a minor.
[00:48:48.423 --> 00:48:51.365]  He goes to grab the camera, and the student does a handoff to me.
[00:48:53.387 --> 00:49:01.473]  I start walking down the hallway with the camera, and it takes him a while, but he notices, runs up to me, and what happened next was something that I didn't expect to happen.
[00:49:01.533 --> 00:49:10.019]  I thought he would ask me for the camera, but before asking me, he grabs me by my shoulders and says, give me the camera.
[00:49:10.805 --> 00:49:16.507]  Now, this is... The policy is, if you refuse to give up an electronic device, you receive two detentions.
[00:49:17.647 --> 00:49:29.931]  Now, if the school was just and followed their policies, this would be definitely worth continuing my operation of... But this guy is Judge Dredd, so he's gonna physically punish you.
[00:49:30.411 --> 00:49:33.112]  Yeah, so, I said, you know you're not getting the camera.
[00:49:33.832 --> 00:49:34.912]  Give me the two detentions.
[00:49:35.213 --> 00:49:36.973]  He goes, it doesn't work that way for me.
[00:49:37.693 --> 00:49:39.774]  He then grabs me from behind.
[00:49:41.074 --> 00:49:46.338]  As if he's bear-hugging me, but aggressively, and begins to jerk me around trying to get the camera.
[00:49:47.078 --> 00:49:50.240]  And, which leads to me being flung sideways into a locker.
[00:49:51.021 --> 00:50:01.189]  I then got free, and began to remove the memory card, because I didn't want to be assaulted anymore in the hallway, so I figured I'd give him the camera and keep the memory card for any footage.
[00:50:01.869 --> 00:50:07.013]  And, what he did now then was grab my wrist with the memory card on it, grab my wrist hard and say,
[00:50:07.722 --> 00:50:09.382]  And he said, give me the hard drive.
[00:50:09.422 --> 00:50:10.543]  You're not taking the hard drive.
[00:50:11.243 --> 00:50:13.163]  So he wanted the evidence of what he's done.
[00:50:13.223 --> 00:50:16.024]  I have a special guest with us in the next hour.
[00:50:16.044 --> 00:50:21.045]  We're going to come back in one minute while we're getting that guest ready and have you finish Robert Wannick.
[00:50:21.105 --> 00:50:24.786]  We've got your video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:24.826 --> 00:50:27.667]  You have school witnesses, though, of what they did.
[00:50:27.807 --> 00:50:32.188]  Finish the story and what you're going to do to stand up against these tyrants.
[00:50:32.248 --> 00:50:36.449]  Because if you let them beat you up, next they'll just intensify the abuse.
[00:50:40.464 --> 00:50:42.326]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:50:43.968 --> 00:50:46.290]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:49.315 --> 00:50:51.917]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:50:52.318 --> 00:50:57.282]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:50:57.662 --> 00:50:59.384]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:50:59.704 --> 00:51:04.528]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:51:04.709 --> 00:51:05.669]  How much do you want?
[00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:06.570]  When do you want it?
[00:51:06.951 --> 00:51:08.552]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:09.653]  When will you need it?
[00:51:09.913 --> 00:51:11.975]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:51:12.115 --> 00:51:13.216]  Will there be any food?
[00:51:13.456 --> 00:51:14.757]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:51:15.418 --> 00:51:17.340]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.023]  Will you go to the Gathering Center and be immunized?
[00:51:20.223 --> 00:51:23.426]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:51:23.806 --> 00:51:27.310]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:28.631]  How much will you need?
[00:51:28.871 --> 00:51:29.472]  We don't know.
[00:51:29.752 --> 00:51:30.673]  How much do you want?
[00:51:30.873 --> 00:51:31.614]  All you can get.
[00:51:31.794 --> 00:51:32.415]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:32.875 --> 00:51:35.636]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:51:35.936 --> 00:51:36.296]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:36.456 --> 00:51:38.556]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:38.777 --> 00:51:39.577]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:40.837]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:40.857 --> 00:51:42.878]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:03.399 --> 00:52:06.220]  We've got the lead singer and founder of Iced Earth.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.381]  It's on more than 20 Billboard charts around the planet.
[00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:12.061]  And on the charts for the last decade.
[00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:14.602]  Very popular heavy metal rock band.
[00:52:15.442 --> 00:52:20.444]  And they're putting out, under the name Sons of Liberty, a free album.
[00:52:21.434 --> 00:52:27.236]  Completely free, and I've listened to a lot of their music off and on over the years, and I'm telling you, this is some of their best music.
[00:52:27.556 --> 00:52:30.177]  And it's all anti-globalist, anti-New World Order.
[00:52:30.777 --> 00:52:33.398]  And the Earth is going into another Ice Age, so what a great name.
[00:52:33.918 --> 00:52:34.778]  Iced Earth here.
[00:52:35.439 --> 00:52:36.719]  Finishing up with Robert Wannick.
[00:52:36.779 --> 00:52:38.860]  Robert, clearly Sunday or Monday.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:39.960]  So what happened next was I
[00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:06.961]  He told me to wait in the hallway for the principal, so I did.
[00:53:07.301 --> 00:53:15.468]  And there was about 20 to 30 students now gathered, waiting in the hallway, just yelling, some of them swearing at the teacher for putting his hands on me.
[00:53:16.168 --> 00:53:19.410]  And when the principal came down, he asked another teacher who was there.
[00:53:19.591 --> 00:53:21.712]  The teacher said, no, he didn't assault him.
[00:53:21.952 --> 00:53:25.315]  As a matter of fact, he didn't put his hands on the student.
[00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:28.882]  This caused just an outrage.
[00:53:29.082 --> 00:53:30.862]  So a total culture of deception.
[00:53:30.902 --> 00:53:33.823]  Just like cops lie for each other, the teachers do this.
[00:53:34.283 --> 00:53:37.323]  And the students just started yelling, you're a liar, I saw you assault Robert.
[00:53:37.463 --> 00:53:39.124]  You need to get affidavits signed.
[00:53:39.364 --> 00:53:40.104]  Take him to court.
[00:53:40.504 --> 00:53:43.925]  I've already got some affidavits signed from over 15 witnesses.
[00:53:44.245 --> 00:53:44.605]  Good.
[00:53:44.825 --> 00:53:46.425]  Now we've got him on line.
[00:53:46.625 --> 00:53:48.485]  We'll get that other teacher fired for lying.
[00:53:48.666 --> 00:53:50.126]  We don't need liars like that.
[00:53:52.005 --> 00:54:02.870]  The other thing is, now we've been trying to... I got called in the office at 310 and told that I was receiving a two-day out-of-school suspension for insubordination and disruption.
[00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:10.793]  All because you politely tried to hand out medical information to students that it's not a forced inoculation?
[00:54:11.954 --> 00:54:14.455]  Yes, and they instigated violence against me.
[00:54:14.915 --> 00:54:16.416]  They caused the disruption.
[00:54:16.934 --> 00:54:22.362]  And I'm getting charged with disruption and getting suspended outside of school.
[00:54:22.683 --> 00:54:26.348]  A three day suspension is what is merited by- Well, Robert, let's go back.
[00:54:26.628 --> 00:54:27.490]  Robert, let's go back.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:33.504]  Briefly, to three years ago, we had to write an article about this, in Maryland.
[00:54:34.064 --> 00:54:35.705]  And I had the state attorney on.
[00:54:36.185 --> 00:54:37.806]  And he admitted, yeah, there's no law, you gotta take it.
[00:54:38.027 --> 00:54:40.708]  But they told 2,000 parents and kids this.
[00:54:40.989 --> 00:54:46.912]  They lined up with SWAT teams and police dogs and wouldn't let the activists tell them it wasn't the law.
[00:54:47.333 --> 00:54:54.357]  And on CNN, mainly black people, crying, saying, I don't want to take it, I get sick when I take it, but it's the law.
[00:54:54.878 --> 00:54:57.840]  You're not even allowed to tell them it's not the law.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.401]  Absolutely right.
[00:55:01.042 --> 00:55:06.826]  When it's not even mandatory, when it's voluntary, you're not even allowed to give them risks peacefully.
[00:55:07.226 --> 00:55:15.852]  And I'm being harassed and threatened more, saying if I release any footage, I'll receive more suspension, and they'll possibly recommend expulsion.
[00:55:16.252 --> 00:55:26.319]  So, so, so, so, I mean to be clear, you have witnesses on video, that's up on YouTube, but they're saying if you release any more footage, they're saying outside of school, you're not allowed to stand up to them.
[00:55:26.707 --> 00:55:28.408]  No, any footage from inside the school.
[00:55:28.428 --> 00:55:33.632]  Like, if you watch the video, I have a few clips that are from inside the school that I have written consent to release.
[00:55:34.192 --> 00:55:37.755]  Those are allegedly going to merit me with more.
[00:55:38.255 --> 00:55:43.939]  Well, they're just trying to cover up what happened, and they better watch it because this is starting to turn into racketeering.
[00:55:44.679 --> 00:55:46.941]  So, where are you going from here, Robert?
[00:55:46.961 --> 00:55:53.706]  I mean, I think the way to do it is now get with a hundred of the young men and women, and all of you hand out flyers per class.
[00:55:54.426 --> 00:55:55.707]  They won't be able to stop that.
[00:55:56.007 --> 00:55:59.088]  What you did was bold because it made them show that they're the tyrants.
[00:55:59.408 --> 00:56:00.269]  They went after you.
[00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:01.849]  Now it's the talk of the school.
[00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:05.011]  Now everyone will want the forbidden literature.
[00:56:05.411 --> 00:56:09.753]  Now you have the school in your hand as you rebel against the system.
[00:56:10.073 --> 00:56:13.855]  Now you are literally launching the Sons of Liberty program.
[00:56:14.575 --> 00:56:23.159]  What I'm doing now is pressing charges against the teacher who assaulted me because the school has not taken legal action and will not release any security footage.
[00:56:23.598 --> 00:56:27.402]  We have no clue if they even still have the footage on camera.
[00:56:27.442 --> 00:56:29.064]  You need to put a press release out.
[00:56:29.084 --> 00:56:33.750]  See, notice, they're lying, you have affidavits, and notice their camera's malfunction.
[00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:38.095]  We'll talk to you Sunday or Monday with a more detailed report on this, Robert.
[00:56:38.315 --> 00:56:39.216]  But this is big.
[00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:40.417]  But I suggest...
[00:56:41.218 --> 00:56:46.766]  Maybe back off for a while, just so you can get back to school and have everyone hand out flyers.
[00:56:46.846 --> 00:56:55.198]  And everyone across the nation, you should be giving flyers to people in school, instead of just worshipping big government and taking Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:56:55.579 --> 00:56:57.341]  Robert Wannick, we salute you!

[00:58:03.606 --> 00:58:05.528]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:58:05.689 --> 00:58:07.971]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:08.131 --> 00:58:09.973]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[00:58:58.151 --> 00:59:02.374]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:59:02.694 --> 00:59:03.315]  Number one.
[00:59:03.615 --> 00:59:06.778]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:59:07.038 --> 00:59:07.618]  Number two.
[00:59:07.898 --> 00:59:12.462]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:13.243]  It's true.
[00:59:13.543 --> 00:59:18.106]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:18.406 --> 00:59:18.867]  Number three.
[00:59:19.207 --> 00:59:22.510]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:26.553]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:27.514 --> 00:59:29.895]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:30.276 --> 00:59:33.618]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:34.739 --> 00:59:38.660]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:43.641]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:47.982]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:48.103 --> 00:59:49.683]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:49.903 --> 00:59:54.504]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:00:07.242 --> 01:00:12.987]  We're good to go.
[01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:31.539]  Yeah.
[01:00:48.143 --> 01:00:50.424]  We're going to be playing more of it in the next hour.
[01:00:50.444 --> 01:00:57.866]  I am really flattered that he came all the way to Austin, Texas to be with us today for the rest of the hour.
[01:00:57.886 --> 01:01:06.648]  And I mean, I know that a lot of people at the office are big Iced Earth fans, and I know I'd heard the music over the years and really liked it.
[01:01:06.668 --> 01:01:08.989]  I don't have a lot of time to get into music in the last decade.
[01:01:09.009 --> 01:01:09.869]  I'm working all the time.
[01:01:10.889 --> 01:01:13.730]  But then I heard the new album that we were sent.
[01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:16.511]  It's being released today free online.
[01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:17.572]  I don't know.
[01:01:29.073 --> 01:01:35.397]  Corrupted leaders hijack freedom, acting in duress, and it goes on to talk about the creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:01:35.437 --> 01:01:36.898]  That's the name of that track.
[01:01:37.598 --> 01:01:42.822]  It talks about the answer to 1984 is 1776, and we are going to stand against your tyranny.
[01:01:42.942 --> 01:01:47.685]  We are agents of free humanity in the Fed, in the Fed, in the Fed, and it goes on and on.
[01:01:48.025 --> 01:01:52.108]  And I know that this Sons of Liberty albums
[01:01:52.568 --> 01:01:53.188]  We're good to go.
[01:02:20.046 --> 01:02:22.008]  All over the world, Ice Earth is huge.
[01:02:22.348 --> 01:02:24.770]  I think it's safe to say even bigger outside the U.S.
[01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:26.591]  than they are in the U.S., but they're big here.
[01:02:26.711 --> 01:02:33.616]  And so, this is so exciting to have Dave Mustaine come out against the New World Order, and Iced Earth, and just more and more people are having these awakenings.
[01:02:33.636 --> 01:02:34.897]  That's what Dave Mustaine calls it.
[01:02:35.157 --> 01:02:35.918]  That's what I had.
[01:02:37.359 --> 01:02:40.284]  We were all once shuttered in, not seeing the larger picture.
[01:02:40.564 --> 01:02:50.840]  And so I'm very honored to have the lead singer here from Ice Dirt, the lead singer from Sons of Liberty, John Schaefer, here with us today.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:51.962]  John, it's great to have you.
[01:02:53.558 --> 01:02:56.441]  Well it's great to have you here as well.
[01:02:57.302 --> 01:03:07.373]  Tell us about iStirrth, Sons of Liberty, Your Awakening, why you're releasing this album for free today, and we'll give people the website so they can check out sons-of-liberty.net.
[01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:12.351]  Well, first of all, I'm actually not the lead singer of Iced Earth.
[01:03:12.911 --> 01:03:15.851]  This is the first album I've ever done lead vocals on.
[01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:18.192]  I've just seen some of their songs where you are singing.
[01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:20.272]  Yeah, there's a couple that I've done in the past.
[01:03:20.292 --> 01:03:21.573]  I guess it's the one we were watching last week.
[01:03:21.593 --> 01:03:22.613]  Yeah, it could have been.
[01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:24.153]  Yeah, the dark-haired guy is singing a lot too.
[01:03:24.873 --> 01:03:25.333]  What's his name?
[01:03:26.474 --> 01:03:29.434]  It depends on which period of the video it was.
[01:03:29.454 --> 01:03:29.894]  See, that's the thing.
[01:03:29.914 --> 01:03:31.715]  I saw different people singing, but I saw you singing.
[01:03:32.415 --> 01:03:40.397]  But anyway, the main thing I think that's important about this is that the awakening that I had was about nine months ago.
[01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:44.798]  And like you, I've been working, you know, constantly for the last 20 years.
[01:03:44.838 --> 01:03:46.199]  I mean, barely taking any vacation.
[01:03:46.219 --> 01:03:49.980]  Well, finally, after the last European tour that we did, I went to Central America for a month.
[01:03:50.714 --> 01:03:54.475]  And then that time, after about a week, I really felt different.
[01:03:54.595 --> 01:03:55.196]  It was weird.
[01:03:55.236 --> 01:04:02.778]  It was like, wait a minute, you know, without all the bombardment of corporate America everywhere and just... The constant distractions.
[01:04:02.898 --> 01:04:03.398]  Absolutely.
[01:04:04.059 --> 01:04:09.300]  And so it was in that period that I really started questioning things and thinking about things a lot.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.261]  And I get back home and
[01:04:11.121 --> 01:04:15.264]  And I start seeing that Obama's doing exactly the same things that Bush was doing.
[01:04:15.764 --> 01:04:18.466]  And it starts, it also starts raising a lot of questions.
[01:04:18.666 --> 01:04:29.293]  And I had, somebody sent me the Zeitgeist Addendum, and when I watched that, the money creation thing, it really, like, I thought at first, this can't be real.
[01:04:29.313 --> 01:04:35.977]  Because I didn't know about the Federal Reserve, I thought, like many people, that this was part of government, that it was, you know, a legit
[01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:46.273]  Well, anyway, I started doing more research and one thing led to another and it was really, I would say, seeing the Creature from Jekyll Island, reading that book.
[01:04:47.219 --> 01:04:56.563]  Um, certainly opened my eyes, and then watching the Obama deception, and I think that's when I had my epiphany, which was really, um, it was, it was devastating, actually, at first.
[01:04:56.603 --> 01:05:08.368]  I mean, I felt like I had a thousand pounds on my chest, like, everything I ever believed in, because I've always been a huge fan of the Revolutionary War period, and I'm walking around my whole life thinking, all this stuff is relevant, that it still matters.
[01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:11.630]  I mean, it does matter to those of us that are real patriots, but I mean,
[01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:14.051]  We've been hijacked and we don't even know it.
[01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:14.892]  Most of the people don't know.
[01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:15.332]  Exactly.
[01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:19.395]  What we really are has been lost and the founders were all about stopping the bankers.
[01:05:19.675 --> 01:05:24.919]  They were all about stopping the manipulators and stopping the people that set up these monopolies.
[01:05:25.079 --> 01:05:25.380]  Right.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.502]  And we're not taught what really, why America was special.
[01:05:28.762 --> 01:05:31.424]  We're not taught what 1776 really means.
[01:05:31.504 --> 01:05:32.104]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:32.124 --> 01:05:35.567]  I mean, and that was like, I mean, I literally broke down and cried.
[01:05:35.627 --> 01:05:36.608]  I mean, it was devastating.
[01:05:36.668 --> 01:05:40.711]  It was a huge, but it was also, you know, I started digging more and it was,
[01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:49.678]  As angry as I got and as sad as I've gone through periods where I've been really sad about it, I also feel liberated because now it makes sense.
[01:05:49.778 --> 01:05:51.580]  That's the thing that people have to realize.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.481]  You can't be afraid of this.
[01:05:53.701 --> 01:05:57.044]  You have to take this knowledge and you have to hold on to it.
[01:05:57.865 --> 01:06:03.490]  For me, it's liberating to have the truth because I can't actually go through life with half-truths.
[01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:04.090]  Nobody can.
[01:06:05.271 --> 01:06:10.436]  You don't feel good even if you don't know what the truth is, but you know it's a lie.
[01:06:10.476 --> 01:06:11.837]  You have this weak feeling.
[01:06:12.137 --> 01:06:16.922]  But even if something is horrible that's happening, once you know the score, it is liberating.
[01:06:16.982 --> 01:06:18.883]  It's empowering to know the truth.
[01:06:18.923 --> 01:06:21.426]  It will set you free, even if you're in a bad situation.
[01:06:21.446 --> 01:06:28.132]  Because then you realize, even if I was still ignorant, if I was still in darkness, this corruption was there all along.
[01:06:28.912 --> 01:06:32.695]  But so many people in the modern age believe perception is reality.
[01:06:32.935 --> 01:06:34.216]  Perception is not reality.
[01:06:34.336 --> 01:06:34.496]  No.
[01:06:34.976 --> 01:06:40.260]  You can have a blindfold on and think you're walking through a field, but really you're walking off the edge of a skyscraper.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.982]  Just because you're blind doesn't mean that you're safe.
[01:06:43.482 --> 01:06:44.243]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:06:45.103 --> 01:06:45.664]  I agree, man.
[01:06:45.684 --> 01:06:47.586]  And I mean, that's the thing.
[01:06:48.026 --> 01:06:51.829]  I actually feel so much better knowing why everything is so screwed up.
[01:06:52.149 --> 01:06:57.874]  And I understand for people that it's very difficult to get out of that left-right paradigm.
[01:06:57.954 --> 01:07:01.778]  I mean, for me, I've lost friends in Afghanistan and in Iraq.
[01:07:01.858 --> 01:07:05.180]  My little brother did two tours over in Iraq, and he's fine.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:11.706]  But I mean, knowing now that this whole thing is fraud, I supported it before because I bought into it.
[01:07:11.886 --> 01:07:15.389]  Well they say 1776 is our military in this empire.
[01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:17.832]  But really, that's the exact opposite.
[01:07:17.852 --> 01:07:19.013]  That's King George III.
[01:07:19.033 --> 01:07:20.154]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:20.294 --> 01:07:21.575]  And I see it now for what it is.
[01:07:22.136 --> 01:07:28.262]  But that doesn't take away from the heroism, the honor of the troops who believe they're doing a good thing.
[01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:29.063]  Absolutely.
[01:07:47.104 --> 01:07:56.751]  I mean, I wasn't hugely into it, but I listened to quite a bit of heavy metal off and on when I heard it on the radio, and I was like, but I like this Sons of Liberty a lot more than Iced Earth, so now I understand.
[01:07:57.191 --> 01:08:01.474]  But it does say here, I'm trying to get your bio straight, that you've been in Iced Earth since the beginning.
[01:08:01.694 --> 01:08:02.295]  Yeah, I started it.
[01:08:02.475 --> 01:08:03.916]  Okay, so you're the founder of iStirts.
[01:08:03.936 --> 01:08:04.336]  Yes.
[01:08:04.616 --> 01:08:18.324]  That's the thing I wanted to get straight, because I'd seen some of the songs you were singing, some of you weren't, and I was confused by it, but now I'm obviously becoming a lot bigger fan of iStirts, just because you've created Sons of Liberty, and folks, this is great, great music.
[01:08:19.185 --> 01:08:23.407]  So, tell us about The Awakening, because obviously I'm excited, I get too excited sometimes.
[01:08:24.588 --> 01:08:29.510]  About your awakening and now nine months later, talk about one person doing something.
[01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:36.194]  You've already launched a free album that you're launching today that will reach tens of millions of people.
[01:08:36.594 --> 01:08:37.494]  Well, we can only hope.
[01:08:37.534 --> 01:08:42.817]  I mean, the process was, like I said at first, it was just, I was really devastated.
[01:08:42.877 --> 01:08:46.678]  And then the more I dug, the more disturbed I got.
[01:08:46.698 --> 01:08:49.940]  But I thought, I can't have this knowledge and not do anything about it.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.964]  I mean, the only power I have is music, so I need to, I said, I gotta get my head out of the books for a while and get into the studio.
[01:08:56.024 --> 01:08:58.525]  And the first song I wrote was called Our Dying Republic.
[01:08:59.086 --> 01:09:03.208]  And it has sort of a, it's more of a ballad, I guess.
[01:09:04.589 --> 01:09:09.872]  I guess at that point I was feeling more down than I was angry, so some of the aggressive stuff came later.
[01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.974]  But I decided at that point that I had to do this.
[01:09:13.054 --> 01:09:17.757]  I had to, you know, do it, because I was doing research hours and hours a day.
[01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:21.502]  I mean, whenever I find out something that really strikes me, I go for it.
[01:09:35.981 --> 01:09:37.383]  Well, that's the great synergy.
[01:09:37.523 --> 01:09:40.706]  As my listeners tune into what you're doing, your listeners tune into what we're doing.
[01:09:40.746 --> 01:09:41.867]  It's that synergy.
[01:09:41.887 --> 01:09:48.234]  And absolutely, I want to challenge all the Ice to Earth fans, all the Sons of Liberty fans, as Sons of Liberty launches today.
[01:09:48.274 --> 01:09:49.015]  I'm honored you're here.
[01:09:49.776 --> 01:09:52.459]  Understand the power of music, the power of media.
[01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:55.281]  And also understand, you never know who you're going to wake up.
[01:09:55.561 --> 01:10:03.707]  You may wake somebody up, who then wakes somebody up, who wakes somebody up like John Schaeffer, who will then wake up millions of people, and that's how we're going to win this thing.
[01:10:03.947 --> 01:10:07.510]  As Thomas Jefferson said, the truth is so much more powerful than a lie.
[01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:16.557]  And we are setting bushfires in the minds of men that will explosively ignite the world with liberty.
[01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:19.539]  And you sing about that in your lyrics, and that gets me on fire.
[01:10:19.659 --> 01:10:22.921]  Yeah man, I mean, and I hope, there's already, we've already seen a lot of stuff.
[01:10:22.941 --> 01:10:29.945]  People think that because this is coming out now that it's an anti-Bush thing and they've got to get beyond that because it's, these guys work for the same people.
[01:10:30.285 --> 01:10:30.685]  You know what I mean?
[01:10:30.745 --> 01:10:35.348]  And that's the whole goal is to make, to me there's so many people that are not aware of the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:36.008 --> 01:10:39.430]  And that system is, it's the cancer of our land.
[01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:41.952]  It is absolutely the thing that, it doesn't matter who we elect.
[01:10:42.152 --> 01:10:47.575]  And I fear as much as I think Ron Paul would be awesome, I would fear for his safety.
[01:10:48.055 --> 01:10:48.575]  Absolutely.
[01:10:48.595 --> 01:10:51.956]  We're going to go out to break again with Jekyll Island.
[01:10:51.976 --> 01:10:53.037]  Some of the lyrics from that.
[01:10:53.377 --> 01:11:07.161]  We're going to come back with a bunch of other great songs like Indentured Servitude, Cleansing Wind, and also some of the other great songs like We the People and others.
[01:11:07.201 --> 01:11:07.661]  Stay with us.
[01:11:13.877 --> 01:11:15.923]  My guys don't normally run the music from this end.
[01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:20.555]  They're out there watching the clock.
[01:11:20.856 --> 01:11:21.758]  We'll be right back.
[01:11:59.375 --> 01:12:01.236]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:12:01.356 --> 01:12:06.519]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:08.040]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:16.485]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:12:16.725 --> 01:12:22.448]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:12:22.608 --> 01:12:24.390]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:26.613]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:30.998]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:12:31.179 --> 01:12:33.301]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:12:33.381 --> 01:12:41.251]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:13:00.265 --> 01:13:03.928]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:04.268 --> 01:13:07.291]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:07.531 --> 01:13:08.952]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:13:09.631 --> 01:13:12.292]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:12.312 --> 01:13:18.535]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:18.695 --> 01:13:23.737]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:23.757 --> 01:13:33.862]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:33.982 --> 01:13:36.102]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:36.343 --> 01:13:37.683]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:37.923 --> 01:13:40.203]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:40.383 --> 01:13:42.224]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:42.504 --> 01:13:47.325]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:13:47.645 --> 01:13:56.767]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:59.488 --> 01:14:00.730]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.333]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:06.696]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[01:14:07.237 --> 01:14:11.462]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[01:14:12.003 --> 01:14:17.169]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[01:14:17.749 --> 01:14:21.992]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.

[01:14:36.821 --> 01:14:38.483]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[01:14:38.863 --> 01:14:43.886]  Use Zeolife and OxySilver Hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[01:14:44.206 --> 01:14:46.808]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.
[01:14:47.088 --> 01:14:49.231]  Call 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:14:49.511 --> 01:14:51.554]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.

[01:14:58.769 --> 01:15:00.811]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[01:15:00.831 --> 01:15:02.854]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[01:15:03.294 --> 01:15:04.715]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[01:15:05.096 --> 01:15:08.640]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.245]  Beta Prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[01:15:13.605 --> 01:15:18.190]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.

[01:15:33.114 --> 01:15:35.874]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[01:15:36.134 --> 01:15:37.555]  You only pay shipping and handling.

[01:16:16.730 --> 01:16:19.412]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[01:16:19.432 --> 01:16:23.955]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[01:16:24.215 --> 01:16:27.797]  President Bush said, and he braved that aisle for me, myself, that we needed a new world order.
[01:16:27.837 --> 01:16:33.101]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:38.944]  I think the new world order he's referring to... We have a real chance at this new world order.
[01:16:38.964 --> 01:16:45.769]  An order in which incredible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision
[01:16:50.578 --> 01:16:52.215]  of this free album.
[01:16:54.098 --> 01:17:00.483]  John Schafer poured his heart and soul into his Sons-of-Liberty.net.
[01:17:00.523 --> 01:17:02.605]  The album is Sons of Liberty.
[01:17:03.246 --> 01:17:09.851]  Brushfires, I call it bushfires, but it's brushfires in the minds of men.
[01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:12.594]  That's actually what Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:17:12.934 --> 01:17:15.416]  Down here in Texas, brush turns into bushfires.
[01:17:17.158 --> 01:17:20.461]  And you go to the site, it's MyInfo, Ron Paul, G. Edward Griffin.
[01:17:21.721 --> 01:17:33.286]  I can't thank you enough for doing this, John, and for having G. Edward Griffin get in contact with us and give us the CD and say that, hey, Mr. Schaefer would like to break this on your show, thinks it's the ideal place to do it.
[01:17:33.986 --> 01:17:36.567]  Again, I'm just super excited, and I hope the listeners
[01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:43.150]  Take advantage of this and then don't go, oh this guy could have made millions of dollars off this like your other albums do.
[01:17:43.170 --> 01:17:45.351]  You know, he made it for us for free.
[01:17:45.871 --> 01:17:47.192]  We're not going to appreciate this.
[01:17:47.292 --> 01:17:51.614]  I hope everybody gets this new album, Sons of Liberty, out to everyone.
[01:17:51.977 --> 01:17:52.698]  Yeah, me too.
[01:17:52.738 --> 01:17:54.219]  I mean, that's the whole point of doing it.
[01:17:54.259 --> 01:18:01.844]  They can purchase a higher resolution audio quality for like $7.99 in a download, and there will be at some point physical distribution where it will be in the store.
[01:18:01.864 --> 01:18:02.385]  Oh, that's good.
[01:18:02.425 --> 01:18:03.125]  Defund yourself.
[01:18:03.165 --> 01:18:03.866]  We need to do that.
[01:18:03.986 --> 01:18:06.908]  Yeah, I mean, exactly, because it costs me a lot of money to do this.
[01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:09.630]  But I mean, my thing is copy it.
[01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:11.051]  If you buy a CD, copy it.
[01:18:11.111 --> 01:18:13.373]  It costs money for you to fly here to Texas to promote it.
[01:18:13.553 --> 01:18:14.314]  Yeah.
[01:18:14.334 --> 01:18:15.435]  Time is really what...
[01:18:16.801 --> 01:18:17.903]  Yeah, that too.
[01:18:17.963 --> 01:18:20.306]  I mean, but you know, this is important stuff.
[01:18:20.527 --> 01:18:21.368]  It's a big deal for me.
[01:18:21.468 --> 01:18:28.358]  So I mean, to spend the time and I would have been doing another project in place of this had I not done this record, but I decided to.
[01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:31.641]  You know, everything had to kind of go on hold.
[01:18:31.661 --> 01:18:40.352]  Well, going back 14 years ago, I pioneered and I mean, I wasn't aware of what I was doing, but I did pioneer saying, here, my film's free.
[01:18:40.913 --> 01:18:46.620]  And that actually woke up a lot of people and created a large listening base, which later made us financially.
[01:18:48.522 --> 01:18:57.047]  You know, stable so we could expand a little bit, but again, it is important for people to support what you're doing at sons-of-liberty.net.
[01:18:57.067 --> 01:18:59.109]  We've got links to it up on Infowars.com.
[01:18:59.349 --> 01:19:04.092]  This is a short segment, but finishing up, John, your awakening.
[01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:07.834]  So what was the process like building up to then making this album?
[01:19:08.735 --> 01:19:23.486]  Well, basically from the time that I wrote the first song, Our Dying Republic, then it turned into, the idea kind of blossomed into, you know, I went into the studio that day, I literally wrote that song and recorded it, programmed the drums, did the vocals of everything in one day.
[01:19:23.646 --> 01:19:25.928]  I mean, I was that, like, shook up about it.
[01:19:26.588 --> 01:19:30.771]  And from that point on, I was thinking, you know, what can I do?
[01:19:30.811 --> 01:19:31.632]  What can I do with this?
[01:19:31.852 --> 01:19:39.177]  And I just decided to go for it and make it a full... I guess it is sort of a concept album.
[01:19:39.217 --> 01:19:41.819]  I mean, it's certainly the same theme running through it.
[01:19:41.879 --> 01:19:44.801]  And it's the song The Cleansing Wind on there, that's about my...
[01:19:45.862 --> 01:19:55.989]  My trip to Central America and how that was really the thing that made me realize that it was kind of the beginning of the breaking free of the matrix.
[01:19:56.009 --> 01:19:56.710]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:59.732]  Being down at a place where you literally are with nature.
[01:19:59.752 --> 01:20:02.794]  It was just me and my family spending good quality time together for a month.
[01:20:02.954 --> 01:20:05.837]  And after a week or 10 days, I physically began to feel different.
[01:20:06.257 --> 01:20:07.218]  I'm thinking, what is this?
[01:20:07.258 --> 01:20:07.858]  What's going on?
[01:20:07.898 --> 01:20:09.679]  And just the whole process.
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.921]  And so by the time I got home, you know,
[01:20:13.482 --> 01:20:14.503]  I knew something was up.
[01:20:14.923 --> 01:20:20.808]  It was weird, it was just... So you woke up totally independently before you started searching for more info?
[01:20:21.168 --> 01:20:23.730]  Yeah, there was... Wow, that's really... that's powerful.
[01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:25.272]  There was a different feeling there.
[01:20:25.452 --> 01:20:27.934]  You know, the water was different, the whole thing... Oh yeah, no, no.
[01:20:28.134 --> 01:20:34.679]  I mean, it's all the frequency pollution, the water, they put poison on record in there, you know, to destabilize people.
[01:20:34.839 --> 01:20:41.785]  It's the flashing lights, the signs, the busyness, how we're all so distracted
[01:20:42.265 --> 01:20:54.628]  That we are really programmed when you get in nature for a couple days, I mean this happens to me, but now I can almost not take it because then I start really understanding levels I hadn't and it's just my brain starts moving too quick.
[01:20:55.308 --> 01:20:57.588]  I mean I know for you it was good to wake up out there.
[01:20:57.628 --> 01:20:57.768]  Yeah.
[01:20:57.848 --> 01:21:06.870]  But now I'm almost scared to go away to the jungle for two weeks because I mean I already know too much and it's just and now it's starting to really get spooky.
[01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:07.270]  Right.
[01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:09.491]  Hey, you know and the thing is the people out there can
[01:21:10.191 --> 01:21:11.652]  They can call us kooks all they want.
[01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:14.993]  The fact is that the research is there.
[01:21:15.193 --> 01:21:15.813]  You know, do it.
[01:21:16.033 --> 01:21:16.653]  Get informed.
[01:21:16.693 --> 01:21:23.396]  If you want to... You can't say... Because honestly, I thought a lot of this stuff that I heard... My father was a John Birch guy.
[01:21:23.836 --> 01:21:30.779]  So, you know, when I was a young child, I remember certain things that him and his friends would talk about concerning the United Nations and stuff.
[01:21:31.379 --> 01:21:33.280]  And then there was a point where he just didn't talk about it anymore.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.921]  And unfortunately, he died a couple years ago, so I can't...
[01:21:36.755 --> 01:21:37.436]  Talk to him now.
[01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:38.056]  I wish I could.
[01:21:38.076 --> 01:21:45.042]  Oh, so there were those seeds, and now 20, 30 years later, everything he was talking about is now coming true on the nightly news.
[01:21:45.062 --> 01:21:45.523]  Stay with us.
[01:21:45.543 --> 01:21:48.545]  We'll be right back with more Sons of Liberty.
[01:21:49.046 --> 01:21:49.967]  We're on the march.
[01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:52.048]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:52.969 --> 01:21:55.672]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:59.229 --> 01:22:01.830]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:07.193]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:22:07.553 --> 01:22:09.294]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:22:09.614 --> 01:22:14.416]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:22:14.616 --> 01:22:15.577]  How much do you want?
[01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:16.537]  When do you want it?
[01:22:16.917 --> 01:22:18.518]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:22:18.798 --> 01:22:19.618]  When will you need it?
[01:22:19.878 --> 01:22:21.939]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:22:22.079 --> 01:22:23.180]  Will there be any food?
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:24.721]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:22:25.401 --> 01:22:27.323]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:30.007]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:22:30.207 --> 01:22:33.391]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:22:33.791 --> 01:22:37.295]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:22:37.616 --> 01:22:38.597]  How much will you need?
[01:22:38.837 --> 01:22:39.458]  We don't know.
[01:22:39.738 --> 01:22:40.659]  How much do you want?
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:41.581]  All you can get.
[01:22:41.601 --> 01:22:42.602]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:22:42.862 --> 01:22:45.626]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:22:45.906 --> 01:22:48.109]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:49.131]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:22:58.228 --> 01:23:03.395]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:23:03.535 --> 01:23:07.881]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:23:08.061 --> 01:23:09.924]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:23:10.344 --> 01:23:11.706]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:23:11.966 --> 01:23:12.988]  There is a solution.
[01:23:13.228 --> 01:23:21.234]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:23:58.134 --> 01:24:04.998]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:24:05.098 --> 01:24:06.359]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:24:06.379 --> 01:24:07.060]  It's very real.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.962]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:24:11.102 --> 01:24:15.425]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:25:15.106 --> 01:25:41.539]  Without distractions Far from chaos Born with nature I see what I'm meant to be As the winds wash over me A chain reaction I have awakened To boldly question What I've been led to believe
[01:25:42.842 --> 01:25:44.904]  My quest for true liberty.
[01:25:44.924 --> 01:25:56.576]  Cleansing winds have washed over me and now I'm free.
[01:25:57.977 --> 01:26:05.164]  I hold the truth and all that it brings and I will speak.
[01:26:06.713 --> 01:26:08.195]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're back.
[01:26:08.255 --> 01:26:09.616]  That's Cleansing Wind.
[01:26:09.796 --> 01:26:16.464]  And again, a free album, complete album, made by the founder of Iced Earth, John Schaefer.
[01:26:16.564 --> 01:26:19.347]  Available for free at suns-of-liberty.net.
[01:26:23.431 --> 01:26:26.673]  Or you can simply go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:26.973 --> 01:26:28.894]  We've got links up there today.
[01:26:29.355 --> 01:26:33.537]  And also when we post this later to PrisonPlanet.tv, we'll put a link to the site there.
[01:26:33.797 --> 01:26:43.743]  And then later when this is posted to the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube, up in the corner, we will also post a link to go get the free album.
[01:26:44.223 --> 01:26:45.584]  And hopefully you'll spread it with others.
[01:26:45.864 --> 01:26:50.927]  For rock and roll and heavy metal fans, this will certainly be another big awakening.
[01:26:52.128 --> 01:26:58.774]  Again, so many people in Hollywood and in music and in science and in culture are shattering the left-right paradigm.
[01:26:59.114 --> 01:27:04.599]  Look at how the left is coming out now against the health care plan, finding out it was all a big rip-off for banks.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.121]  I mean, everything is a rip-off for banks.
[01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:08.242]  They control the world.
[01:27:08.763 --> 01:27:17.631]  Anything and everything they do, banker bailouts, Kyoto, Copenhagen, health care, it's all going to be a scam, just like you said before the break.
[01:27:18.211 --> 01:27:20.355]  Get past the puppets, get to the bankers.
[01:27:20.615 --> 01:27:22.579]  So continue with your awakening, John Schaefer.
[01:27:22.719 --> 01:27:29.471]  Well, when you say that too, that's the thing that I think infuriates me because I'm a huge supporter of the troops and I know that they are
[01:27:31.707 --> 01:27:34.088]  Doing what they believe is right.
[01:27:34.648 --> 01:27:43.172]  But the thing is, when you figure out that this is all happening for a bunch of bankers and elitists, it's a horrible thing.
[01:27:43.212 --> 01:27:44.432]  It's just absolutely horrible.
[01:27:44.472 --> 01:27:50.915]  So awareness to that institution has got to be brought to the forefront if we're going to have any chance at correcting
[01:27:51.175 --> 01:27:52.376]  And that's the thing about war.
[01:27:52.536 --> 01:27:54.857]  The guys fighting and dying, they are heroic.
[01:27:55.117 --> 01:27:56.437]  They are saving their buddies.
[01:27:56.877 --> 01:27:59.258]  But they've been put in a fraudulent situation.
[01:27:59.498 --> 01:28:03.620]  And so they start confusing their heroism with the overall evil.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.081]  And the government does that on purpose.
[01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:07.622]  They say, look at these troops with their arms and legs blown off.
[01:28:07.662 --> 01:28:08.582]  They've got courage.
[01:28:09.082 --> 01:28:10.963]  That's only meant to make the system look good.
[01:28:11.283 --> 01:28:11.484]  Right.
[01:28:11.604 --> 01:28:11.864]  I know.
[01:28:12.024 --> 01:28:12.904]  I mean... But I'm interrupting.
[01:28:13.624 --> 01:28:14.765]  Continue with Your Awakening.
[01:28:15.005 --> 01:28:17.126]  Continue with some of the other songs in the album.
[01:28:19.052 --> 01:28:20.633]  Well, let's run down the list.
[01:28:20.653 --> 01:28:24.033]  I mean, basically, Jekyll Island, we've talked about that.
[01:28:24.053 --> 01:28:27.194]  I think everybody needs to get this book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:28:27.274 --> 01:28:34.836]  It's absolutely crucial in the whole scheme to understand what is going on in our world.
[01:28:34.936 --> 01:28:37.377]  And I actually just started another one of
[01:28:38.559 --> 01:28:44.249]  I mean, that's another institution that needs to get the hell out of this country.
[01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:46.673]  I mean, you know, we have, it's just bad.
[01:28:46.733 --> 01:28:48.376]  It's just bad in every way you can think.
[01:28:48.516 --> 01:28:51.862]  And awareness is the key to figuring this out, because they make everything look
[01:28:52.771 --> 01:28:59.295]  Um, like it's good when it's actually the root cause of everything that's wrong, actually, you know, in so many ways.
[01:28:59.315 --> 01:29:09.842]  So, I mean, we have to be aware of that, and I strongly recommend people get The Creature from Jekyll Island because that book will open your eyes big time.
[01:29:10.022 --> 01:29:11.863]  It's thoroughly researched.
[01:29:11.943 --> 01:29:12.444]  It's fact.
[01:29:12.524 --> 01:29:12.944]  It's real.
[01:29:13.885 --> 01:29:16.066]  And so, Don't Tread on Me is the next song.
[01:29:16.086 --> 01:29:17.207]  That's another one we can run down.
[01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:18.368]  I mean, that's kind of a...
[01:29:19.881 --> 01:29:22.603]  I mean, all of these have obviously the very similar theme.
[01:29:22.643 --> 01:29:30.107]  They may touch on different points of the whole scenario, but that sort of
[01:29:31.527 --> 01:29:35.090]  Hopefully with the verses, the lyrics in the verses, it's going to make people think a little bit.
[01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:42.735]  Even if they aren't listening to this show right now, and they don't know, but they just hear the song, hopefully they can hear the lyrics.
[01:29:43.175 --> 01:29:54.462]  And we did mix this to where, normally on a metal record, I would never mix the vocals this loud, but my producer engineer and I thought, the message is so important on this that we really need to put it out there.
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:56.481]  Absolutely.
[01:29:56.761 --> 01:30:00.224]  Guys, I want to go out, not with the end of Cleansing Wind.
[01:30:00.824 --> 01:30:09.851]  Let's be sure and go out with that particularly powerful part of Jekyll Island, where it's got the clip about 1984, 1776, in the Fed, in the Fed.
[01:30:13.374 --> 01:30:18.656]  And then if we've got time to get the CD in there, perhaps we should play Don't Tread on Me or part of it.
[01:30:18.696 --> 01:30:25.519]  Pick a spot to play in the middle of this segment because you came all the way to Texas and time is running out already.
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:26.820]  So much to talk about.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:31.342]  But again, Sons-of-Liberty.net.
[01:30:31.442 --> 01:30:36.044]  Free album launched today, Friday, December 18th, 2009.
[01:30:37.064 --> 01:30:41.326]  And you told me that, talk about synergy or synchronicity.
[01:30:41.586 --> 01:30:42.427]  You were in an airport.
[01:30:43.147 --> 01:30:51.214]  And somebody walked up to you and said, hey brother, check it out, Sons of Liberty, a national biker group, who are against the New World Order.
[01:30:51.554 --> 01:30:52.895]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:30:53.415 --> 01:30:59.460]  And the last domino to fall is the population, people like yourself, myself, who are awakened.
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:06.986]  We don't understand, we're already pretty much the majority, because the controlled media still has that illusion going that we're the minority, that we're the weirdos.
[01:31:07.326 --> 01:31:10.329]  No, there is a huge awakening happening right now.
[01:31:10.489 --> 01:31:10.809]  There is.
[01:31:12.370 --> 01:31:12.630]  I hope.
[01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:14.172]  My fear is I hope it's not too late.
[01:31:14.352 --> 01:31:15.293]  You know, that's the only thing.
[01:31:15.313 --> 01:31:21.538]  And I know that there are many people out there, many groups out there that are trying to do the right thing.
[01:31:21.558 --> 01:31:27.563]  And I mean, the Continental Congress that went on this past November, that's a good step in the right direction.
[01:31:28.724 --> 01:31:34.388]  It's just that it's, you know, I really worry about the sovereignty of our country and all the countries on the planet.
[01:31:34.468 --> 01:31:37.831]  You know, I mean, this is very disturbing stuff that's happening here.
[01:31:39.022 --> 01:31:42.068]  You know, but awareness is certainly... I mean, if good people don't...
[01:31:43.248 --> 01:31:46.350]  Don't know what's going on, then there certainly is no hope.
[01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:51.893]  So they can call me a kook, they can call you a kook, they can do whatever they want, but we're going to get through to some people.
[01:31:51.973 --> 01:31:53.994]  Well, I mean, the denial is over, though.
[01:31:54.074 --> 01:31:55.675]  Open world government's being announced.
[01:31:55.695 --> 01:31:56.035]  For sure.
[01:31:56.135 --> 01:31:58.757]  They're just saying, we're your savior, world government's good.
[01:31:59.057 --> 01:32:04.700]  And thank God we've been there, people like your dad, warning people decades ago about the truth.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:12.124]  They got laughed at then, but because those seeds were planted, we have a good fighting chance now because of the people's shoulders we stand on.
[01:32:12.284 --> 01:32:19.449]  Yeah, I guess the thing for me is that even if we find good politicians to send into the place, and that's sort of an oxymoron, isn't it?
[01:32:19.469 --> 01:32:20.189]  Good politician.
[01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:21.150]  But I mean, there are a few.
[01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:27.914]  And if we find to send them and we get them into office, you know, how long are they going to stay good?
[01:32:27.994 --> 01:32:29.095]  How long are they going to stay safe?
[01:32:29.255 --> 01:32:33.218]  You know, these are the things... Yeah, we're dealing with a criminal regime that kills people.
[01:32:33.518 --> 01:32:37.661]  But once we've identified the real regime, killing people won't cut it anymore.
[01:32:37.681 --> 01:32:39.162]  It's like Ceausescu in Romania.
[01:32:39.562 --> 01:32:40.362]  It will finally fall.
[01:32:41.718 --> 01:32:51.280]  Well, and that's why I'm doing this, because I think if I can help in some small way with this stuff, then, you know, it's worth doing.
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:33:00.722]  By the way, the Sons of Liberty website is an awesome news site with links and information, and you've got other sections like Meet the Shackles.
[01:33:01.422 --> 01:33:02.882]  What happens when you meet the shackles?
[01:33:02.922 --> 01:33:07.403]  Well, it's a little bit of a sarcastic twist on how the New World Order would view
[01:33:08.423 --> 01:33:08.584]  This is
[01:33:26.587 --> 01:33:26.888]  That's right.
[01:33:39.417 --> 01:33:42.918]  The dollar bill and the, or the dollar sign and the infinity sign.
[01:33:43.278 --> 01:33:47.119]  And then, you know, you ram these spikes through and that gives it this, it's pretty twisted.
[01:33:47.159 --> 01:33:48.340]  No, it's powerful.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.100]  It works.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:49.740]  You know what's funny?
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:34:01.464]  I hadn't asked you what that meant, but when I looked at it, that's what I picked up is this is eternity, jail bars, and a key, which is the idea of you can get freedom anytime you want.
[01:34:01.484 --> 01:34:02.184]  There's a key.
[01:34:02.484 --> 01:34:03.664]  You've just got to discover it.
[01:34:04.385 --> 01:34:05.285]  And, uh,
[01:34:05.885 --> 01:34:12.729]  The only part I missed was the spikes through the wrist, but I guess your wrist... If you turn it vertically, it looks more like the dollar sign that way.
[01:34:12.989 --> 01:34:15.150]  Wow, that is a powerful symbol.
[01:34:15.210 --> 01:34:16.591]  Your buddy's a good artist.
[01:34:17.372 --> 01:34:18.993]  Did you come up with that idea, or the guy in Sarajevo?
[01:34:19.013 --> 01:34:23.535]  No, the guy in Sarajevo came up with that concept, and I was like, you know, this is awesome, man.
[01:34:24.876 --> 01:34:25.976]  So it works perfect.
[01:34:25.997 --> 01:34:35.160]  Well, listen, I don't want to just sit here and throw questions at you, and I want to play part of Don't Tread on Me and then go out with my favorite song, of course, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:46.124]  But while you're here, John Schaefer, founder of iStirrf, now the founder of Sons of Liberty, and the new album Brushfires in the Minds of Men, points you'd like to make to the millions of people that are going to tune into this?
[01:34:46.844 --> 01:34:50.225]  Uh, the biggest point is just don't be in denial.
[01:34:50.245 --> 01:34:51.546]  Don't put your head back in the sand.
[01:34:51.766 --> 01:34:54.687]  You know, do the research and trust your gut instinct.
[01:34:54.787 --> 01:34:57.208]  If it feels like it's true, it probably is.
[01:34:57.408 --> 01:34:59.949]  And I mean, because there's a lot of misinformation out there on the Internet.
[01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.809]  And that's the thing, man.
[01:35:00.829 --> 01:35:04.551]  I didn't even back years ago because of my intense schedule and stuff.
[01:35:04.751 --> 01:35:07.432]  The only thing I use the Internet for was for email.
[01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:10.814]  You know, I never really went out on the websites and did all that stuff.
[01:35:10.974 --> 01:35:16.717]  And since I've awakened, there is a lot of stuff out there that I figure is questionable.
[01:35:17.098 --> 01:35:19.219]  But I'm in tune with my gut.
[01:35:19.679 --> 01:35:23.522]  And when I see something and it resonates, then I go with it.
[01:35:24.002 --> 01:35:26.403]  Because I certainly can't trust Fox News or CNN.
[01:35:26.443 --> 01:35:28.605]  And now that you've gone public, I told you off-air.
[01:35:30.404 --> 01:35:38.270]  People are going to try to bait you and say things that aren't true about you just to get you to respond to them so that you burn your energy proving you're not a bad guy.
[01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:41.773]  Ignore them, but you were a smart guy and go, yeah, Alex, I already know that.
[01:35:41.813 --> 01:35:45.376]  Yeah, they've been doing that anyway just for over banned crap.
[01:35:45.396 --> 01:35:45.836]  You know what I mean?
[01:35:45.876 --> 01:35:47.837]  But this is a whole nother level.
[01:35:47.857 --> 01:35:48.678]  So I'm prepared for it.
[01:35:48.698 --> 01:35:49.879]  And you know what?
[01:35:50.239 --> 01:35:51.120]  I will not live in fear.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:55.363]  Living in fear or living a life without liberty is like a prison sentence.
[01:35:55.643 --> 01:35:59.145]  I was just warning you like I warn every other prominent person that really stands up.
[01:35:59.505 --> 01:36:00.666]  Get ready for the first trick.
[01:36:00.926 --> 01:36:02.327]  The first dart of the devil.
[01:36:03.688 --> 01:36:06.189]  And I see so many great people who then get diverted by it.
[01:36:06.450 --> 01:36:08.811]  And as soon as you bite, oh, then it's like piranhas.
[01:36:09.071 --> 01:36:10.432]  Yeah, no, I'm not going to play that game.
[01:36:11.012 --> 01:36:11.453]  Not going to happen.
[01:36:11.473 --> 01:36:12.413]  So I'm really not even warning you.
[01:36:12.453 --> 01:36:13.654]  I'm warning the audience out there.
[01:36:13.774 --> 01:36:15.655]  But it's all little lessons.
[01:36:15.855 --> 01:36:17.236]  And of course, I learn more all the time.
[01:36:17.296 --> 01:36:20.818]  I just want people to relive what I had to trial and error experience.
[01:36:21.879 --> 01:36:23.440]  But other points you'd like to make?
[01:36:24.022 --> 01:36:28.866]  Well, I mean, for the Iced Earth fans out there, we're going to be touring South America next month.
[01:36:29.586 --> 01:36:33.489]  We, actually, yeah, January, late January into February.
[01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:37.332]  And, you know, we'll be working on a new record soon after that.
[01:36:37.973 --> 01:36:42.116]  So as far as Sons of Liberty goes, you know, it's all brand new.
[01:36:42.156 --> 01:36:43.617]  The website is brand new.
[01:36:43.637 --> 01:36:47.800]  We still have a lot of work that we want to do to it, but we wanted to get, I wanted to get this out as soon as possible.
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:52.724]  I mean, the Copenhagen thing was really disturbing me, so I wanted to get, I would have liked to have had it out a few weeks ago.
[01:36:52.884 --> 01:36:57.446]  I couldn't do it last week when you wanted to, but luckily you weren't ready, so this week was perfect.
[01:36:57.607 --> 01:36:58.087]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:58.187 --> 01:37:02.769]  I mean, I just wanted, but I wish I could have had the production done sooner, all in general, because... No, I know that feeling.
[01:37:02.869 --> 01:37:12.534]  I constantly want to make more films, because once you start getting into... For me, it's so fulfilling to know the truth and to be opposing the corruption that it does consume you.
[01:37:12.575 --> 01:37:15.176]  I mean, are you not feeling more fulfilled?
[01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:16.777]  I mean, you look like a pretty fulfilled guy already.
[01:37:16.857 --> 01:37:17.357]  Absolutely.
[01:37:17.397 --> 01:37:18.498]  I mean, like I said, I feel...
[01:37:19.631 --> 01:37:20.452]  It makes sense now.
[01:37:20.632 --> 01:37:21.413]  Everything makes sense.
[01:37:22.614 --> 01:37:24.876]  I can deal with the truth, and I prefer to.
[01:37:24.936 --> 01:37:27.598]  So I feel liberated and happier.
[01:37:27.939 --> 01:37:32.763]  It's like, yeah, it's heavy to know this, but it's also liberating to know this.
[01:37:32.883 --> 01:37:37.648]  Because now all of the things that you wonder, why is it this way?
[01:37:37.708 --> 01:37:38.849]  Why does it have to be this way?
[01:37:38.889 --> 01:37:40.991]  Well, when you know, then you can work on solving it.
[01:37:42.188 --> 01:37:47.950]  I love this line from Creature from Jekyll Island where you say, we are agents of free humanity.
[01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:49.630]  And that's it.
[01:37:49.650 --> 01:37:53.071]  It's not welcome to the club or welcome to our group.
[01:37:53.111 --> 01:37:55.672]  No, it's welcome to, I'm a sentient free being.
[01:37:55.832 --> 01:37:57.212]  I want the truth, whatever it is.
[01:37:57.532 --> 01:38:00.853]  So I want to say, welcome to free humanity.
[01:38:00.933 --> 01:38:03.614]  Welcome to being an agent, a free agent of liberty.
[01:38:03.874 --> 01:38:04.515]  You got it, brother.
[01:38:04.535 --> 01:38:05.275]  It's awesome to have you here.
[01:38:05.315 --> 01:38:15.866]  Let's play a part of, and people can hear the whole thing at the Sons of Liberty website, but let's play a little bit, a minute or so, or two minutes of Don't Tread on Me that we're going to go out with.
[01:38:16.166 --> 01:38:17.988]  Kreiser from Jekyll Island, here it is.
[01:38:39.375 --> 01:38:46.402]  Rising to the challenge is the first step that you take Are you a free spirit or a slave?
[01:38:48.404 --> 01:38:55.631]  Are the institutions that have molded our minds Pushing an agenda filled with lies?
[01:39:08.118 --> 01:39:08.559]  I think.
[01:39:46.226 --> 01:39:47.827]  John Schaefer is our guest.
[01:39:47.867 --> 01:39:52.831]  You know what I like, John, is that you're showing so much range here.
[01:39:53.171 --> 01:39:56.854]  And I think now you need to be the lead singer of Ice to Earth, not just the founder.
[01:39:57.234 --> 01:39:58.575]  I'm not knocking your other lead singer.
[01:39:58.595 --> 01:39:59.215]  He sounds great.
[01:39:59.455 --> 01:40:01.137]  But I mean, there's a lot of range.
[01:40:01.177 --> 01:40:04.359]  These songs sound different from each other.
[01:40:04.379 --> 01:40:08.622]  I mean, you have a lot of, I mean, not just talent, obviously, but a huge range.
[01:40:09.903 --> 01:40:11.044]  I don't even know where it came from.
[01:40:11.064 --> 01:40:15.687]  I mean, I always heard this stuff in my head, but actually, I don't have the range that I would like to have.
[01:40:15.747 --> 01:40:19.270]  And that's one of the reasons that I never even considered doing vocals in Ice Dirt.
[01:40:19.290 --> 01:40:21.532]  Well, I meant range of styles, not just range of voice.
[01:40:22.273 --> 01:40:28.718]  Okay, well... I mean, different genre sounds of heavy metal are... I mean, that song's great.
[01:40:28.738 --> 01:40:30.619]  Yeah, there's a lot of different vibes, too.
[01:40:30.639 --> 01:40:33.542]  I mean, Ice Dirt's got a huge catalog, and there's a lot of different vibes in it.
[01:40:34.284 --> 01:40:36.285]  I'm not a musician, so I'll use all the wrong terms.
[01:40:36.325 --> 01:40:36.966]  Nah, it's okay.
[01:40:37.006 --> 01:40:38.006]  No range with voices.
[01:40:38.106 --> 01:40:40.608]  I mean, I meant just different, whole different sounds.
[01:40:41.008 --> 01:40:42.129]  Yeah, it does.
[01:40:42.289 --> 01:40:47.512]  I mean, I used a different, for Indentured Servitude, I used a Telecaster through a low-watt amp.
[01:40:47.633 --> 01:40:51.075]  I've never done that before on any Ice Dwarf record, but it just, it felt right, you know?
[01:40:51.095 --> 01:40:54.797]  So it's like, there's some different experimental things going on here.
[01:40:54.957 --> 01:40:57.879]  We're gonna go out with my favorite, Jekyll Island.
[01:40:57.999 --> 01:40:59.160]  Get it free right now.

[01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:03.646]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:04.047 --> 01:44:07.051]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:07.291 --> 01:44:08.693]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:44:09.392 --> 01:44:12.053]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:12.073 --> 01:44:18.315]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:18.455 --> 01:44:23.497]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.

[01:46:34.890 --> 01:46:38.354]  I'll be back live Sunday, but I'm going to get some closing comments from you, John.
[01:46:38.574 --> 01:46:48.005]  Again, we're honored you're here and very thankful for the great contribution you've made towards fighting the tyranny and waking folks up and setting brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:46:48.566 --> 01:46:50.048]  Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:46:50.128 --> 01:46:51.709]  in the aftermath of Copenhagen.
[01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:54.192]  We don't know how bad this agreement's going to be.
[01:46:54.232 --> 01:46:58.515]  It's got the global government and the global tax, but it's only got two of the global taxes in it.
[01:46:59.116 --> 01:47:00.897]  We'll know Sunday what happened.
[01:47:00.917 --> 01:47:06.442]  4 to 6 p.m., be sure and join us, and we'll be back live Monday, ladies and gentlemen, as well.

[01:47:08.704 --> 01:47:09.685]  Great to have you here.
[01:47:09.765 --> 01:47:11.525]  The guys are going to take you out and show you around Austin.
[01:47:11.546 --> 01:47:12.586]  I got family in town.
[01:47:12.846 --> 01:47:13.727]  I wish we could hang out.
[01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:22.351]  But certainly, I want to ask you to come back to Austin when you get back from tour in the next three or four months because I really like what you're doing and want to work with you more.
[01:47:22.631 --> 01:47:24.612]  But in closing, we got four minutes left.
[01:47:24.932 --> 01:47:25.793]  You've got the floor.
[01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:32.396]  John Schaefer, founder of Iced Earth and Sons of Liberty, launching his free album today for you.
[01:47:32.716 --> 01:47:33.997]  Take advantage of it, folks.
[01:47:34.277 --> 01:47:35.678]  A new weapon in the info war.
[01:47:35.718 --> 01:47:36.278]  John Schaefer.
[01:47:37.011 --> 01:47:48.537]  I guess my biggest thing is that I'm pleading for people to be open-minded about this and to try to break free from the left-right paradigm because it's a fraud.
[01:47:49.297 --> 01:47:50.598]  I don't care about the rhetoric.
[01:47:51.918 --> 01:47:53.439]  Don't trust what these people say.
[01:47:53.519 --> 01:47:54.840]  You need to watch what they do.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:58.802]  You need to watch their actions and it's becoming
[01:47:59.762 --> 01:48:03.823]  More and more clear to me that things are clearly not what they seem.
[01:48:03.923 --> 01:48:08.784]  So I'm just begging people to think outside of the box a little bit.
[01:48:08.944 --> 01:48:11.864]  You know, learn what it means to be an American.
[01:48:12.224 --> 01:48:13.785]  You know, study the Constitution.
[01:48:13.885 --> 01:48:15.745]  Go back, study the Founders.
[01:48:15.845 --> 01:48:19.546]  Look, they warned us everywhere about this exact thing that's going on.
[01:48:19.926 --> 01:48:21.866]  I mean... Your dad warned us!
[01:48:21.886 --> 01:48:24.046]  You were talking about your dad when you were a kid talking about this.
[01:48:24.086 --> 01:48:27.427]  Yeah, and I mean I was really young then and at some point I think
[01:48:28.007 --> 01:48:30.909]  Maybe the burden was a little bit too much and he just didn't talk about it.
[01:48:30.949 --> 01:48:33.070]  Maybe he stopped getting involved in it.
[01:48:33.391 --> 01:48:34.291]  I'm not sure about that.
[01:48:34.631 --> 01:48:39.054]  I just remember at some point, we didn't, you know, I didn't hear about that kind of stuff anymore.
[01:48:39.094 --> 01:48:41.195]  But I know that he had big concerns.
[01:48:41.236 --> 01:48:50.401]  I mean, I remember him, you know, we'd go into a department store, maybe it was Christmas shopping or whatever, and the cashier would ask for his social security number and he would just like go off, you know.
[01:48:50.441 --> 01:48:53.063]  I mean, he was not a big fan of this whole controversy.
[01:48:53.083 --> 01:48:53.723]  He understood it.
[01:48:54.104 --> 01:49:08.134]  I remember Bobby Vaughn, since dying of a brain tumor, friends with my dad coming over, popping a six-pack of beer after work when I was like five, six, seven, and talking about the New World Order and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the global currency and how they were going to tax everything environmentally.
[01:49:08.694 --> 01:49:10.355]  And they had all the documents.
[01:49:10.375 --> 01:49:12.417]  And of course, my dad wasn't really a member of the JBS.
[01:49:12.677 --> 01:49:15.079]  In high school, he'd given some speeches to conservative groups.
[01:49:15.319 --> 01:49:17.580]  But I remember the JBSers coming over to the house.
[01:49:18.041 --> 01:49:22.564]  And so I think those are seeds, again, that were planted that later awakened.
[01:49:22.904 --> 01:49:23.484]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:23.524 --> 01:49:29.468]  I mean, and you know, you go back and watch what Robert Welch said in the 70s, you know, like, warning.
[01:49:30.269 --> 01:49:30.949]  And it's happening.
[01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:32.070]  It's what they're doing.
[01:49:32.650 --> 01:49:36.553]  And notice how they get attacked by people, by COINTELPRO saying they're feds.
[01:49:36.653 --> 01:49:38.474]  No, judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:49:38.514 --> 01:49:39.895]  The JBS has done a great job.
[01:49:40.015 --> 01:49:40.495]  Absolutely.
[01:49:40.816 --> 01:49:44.138]  And I'm going to be joining that society here shortly.
[01:49:45.299 --> 01:49:48.240]  Because I just think that it's, this whole thing, it's
[01:49:49.362 --> 01:49:50.325]  You gotta give it to them.
[01:49:50.626 --> 01:49:51.268]  It's ingenious.
[01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:52.713]  You know, there's no doubt.
[01:49:52.974 --> 01:49:55.422]  And they have pulled off something that...
[01:49:57.543 --> 01:50:00.766]  I think we're living in the most historic times on the planet, actually, right now.
[01:50:00.986 --> 01:50:02.327]  I mean, this is big stuff.
[01:50:02.507 --> 01:50:04.549]  And people... We're actually blessed to be alive now!
[01:50:04.689 --> 01:50:05.370]  I agree.
[01:50:05.410 --> 01:50:06.671]  I mean, God test us, man.
[01:50:06.711 --> 01:50:07.452]  This is our medal.
[01:50:07.472 --> 01:50:12.136]  We're given all this decadence to make us stand down while this scientific dictatorship comes in.
[01:50:12.496 --> 01:50:15.559]  Will we have the strength to wake up and put it down and slay the dragon?
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:17.140]  I think we do.
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:23.125]  And I actually... You know, the funny thing is, I always... In interviews, when people would ask me, if you could time travel, where would you go?
[01:50:23.928 --> 01:50:30.172]  And I always said to the American Revolution, I felt like I was born in the wrong time period for most of my life.
[01:50:30.192 --> 01:50:32.814]  I mean, when I was a little kid, that's the way my room was decorated.
[01:50:32.854 --> 01:50:38.298]  I didn't have... But that was your destiny, John, in closing, because you are in the second 1776.
