[00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:07.514]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.235]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:11.056]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.696 --> 00:00:12.517]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:14.198]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:18.541]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:23.084]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.352]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:38.021]  We're now simulcasting live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the third and fourth hour of this syndicated radio transmission.
[00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:40.304]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:41.185]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:44.870]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:50.479]  Peter Schiff of Europacific Capital will be joining us coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:00:51.299 --> 00:01:04.333]  Well, this from Slashdot today, and it's also in several other news articles, Amtrak photo contestant arrested by Amtrak police all over the nation.
[00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:13.498]  You'll have a chemistry professor arrested because he has a chemistry set at his house and a neighbor or a carpet cleaner saw it and thought he was a terrorist.
[00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:29.806]  You'll have many famous cases of students who are out doing a photo journalism class of bridges or of buildings or of architecture period and they get arrested and
[00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:33.639]  This is how they're using the war on terror to curl his paranoia.
[00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.243]  We've had New York police walk up and say, turn your video cameras off during a protest.
[00:01:37.343 --> 00:01:38.524]  You know, you could be terrorists.
[00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:40.105]  That camera is a gun.
[00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:42.207]  So, uh, just tyranny.
[00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:48.953]  And it goes on to say photographer, uh, Dwayne Kurzick was standing on the
[00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:59.005]  public platform in New York's Penn Station taking pictures of trains in hopes of winning an annual photo contest that Amtrak have been running since 2003.
[00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.207]  Amtrak police arrested him for refusing to delete the photos when asked
[00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:04.776]  Though they later charged him with trespassing.
[00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:16.863]  Obviously, there is a lack of communication with Amtrak's marketing department, which promotes the annual contest called Pitcher Our Trains and its police department, which has a history of harassing photographers for photographing the same trains.
[00:02:17.243 --> 00:02:22.686]  Not much different than the JetBlue incident from earlier this year, when JetBlue flight attendants had a woman arrested
[00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:32.881]  for refusing to delete a video she filmed in flight while the JetBlue marketing department hosted a contest encouraging passengers to take photos in flight.
[00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:38.465]  Terzik's blog has an account of the arrest on December 21st and the aftermath.
[00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:40.526]  And we're going to get him on the show.
[00:02:41.187 --> 00:02:43.969]  And this happens all over the place.
[00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.811]  I mean, you'll be taking pictures out of the plane window with your little snapshot camera.
[00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.674]  And I've had the flight attendant walk over and say, don't take pictures in here.
[00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.031]  And this is all just part of the First Amendment being attacked.
[00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:57.252]  There's nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:01.936]  And now they're using this to put a chilling effect on free speech and alternative media gathering.
[00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:09.082]  And now they're trying to pass a law in England where you're a terrorist if you take pictures of police, period, so you can't videotape them or photograph them beating people up.
[00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:17.735]  Okay, until the bottom of the hour, we have Peter Schiff on with us, and I want to go through some of the economic numbers that are coming out.
[00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:29.139]  He and many others have been predicting we could go into a depression in the next few years, but now, Mainline Economist Magazine and Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of England yesterday, said that we're already in a depression.
[00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.461]  So, Peter Schiff of Europe Pacific Capital, do you think we're already going into a depression?
[00:03:35.543 --> 00:03:37.004]  Well, unfortunately, I think we are.
[00:03:37.104 --> 00:03:39.206]  I think the government is leading us into a depression.
[00:03:39.226 --> 00:03:41.027]  I don't think it had to be a depression.
[00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:49.553]  I think it had to be a very severe recession, because we have a lot of problems in our economy that have been building for more than a generation.
[00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:57.379]  But in particular, during the Greenspan era, and since the bursting of the dot-com bubble, we have some serious imbalances that need to be addressed.
[00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:05.001]  And a lot of these problems are the result of monetary and fiscal mismanagement and excessive regulation.
[00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:13.403]  But, you know, we need to allow the market to work and to function, and unfortunately the government is not doing that.
[00:04:13.443 --> 00:04:16.864]  The government is simply, you know, exacerbating the problem.
[00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:18.745]  They're leading us deeper into debt.
[00:04:19.205 --> 00:04:22.166]  They're making our economy less efficient and less productive.
[00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:29.974]  And they are in the process of creating a depression, which I think will be an inflationary depression, which is going to be particularly painful for ordinary Americans.
[00:04:31.243 --> 00:04:33.104]  Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Capital.
[00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:34.745]  We're going to break when we come back though.
[00:04:34.765 --> 00:04:40.229]  You predicted this years ago and seem to be getting a lot of media attention because of your accurate predictions.
[00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:54.138]  I want to get your projections, your forecast into the future of how you see this unfolding with the current government operations we see now versus what could happen if we tried to put the brakes on their spending.
[00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:55.619]  So stay with us.
[00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.080]  We'll be right back with Peter Schiff.
[00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.422]  We'll also cover some of the latest economic news.
[00:04:59.782 --> 00:05:00.162]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.804 --> 00:05:06.065]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:10.306]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:05:10.506 --> 00:05:18.449]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:19.169]  We're good to go!
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.220]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.861]  A new world order.
[00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:55.883]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:55.943 --> 00:05:57.323]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:57.343 --> 00:05:59.224]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:59.244 --> 00:06:00.605]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:28.080]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:36.092]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:36.553 --> 00:06:40.015]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:42.917]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:42.997 --> 00:06:44.138]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:44.158 --> 00:06:44.918]  They're not after money.
[00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:46.019]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.940]  They're after power.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.040]  That's what happens here.

[00:08:13.756 --> 00:08:14.738]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:18.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.505 --> 00:08:23.550]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.572]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:08:31.652 --> 00:08:34.493]  Actually, we have Peter Schiff with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:39.675]  We'll open the phones up for your financial questions at the bottom of the hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:39.695 --> 00:08:50.260]  We'll be giving out to Mr. Schiff's Euro-Pacific website as well, and we'll post it on screen for everybody out there that is watching.
[00:08:51.724 --> 00:09:00.587]  Okay, Mr. Schiff, I think it's important, since we've got plenty of time with you today, and we're thankful for that, tell us a little bit about yourself, some of the predictions and projections, forecasts you've made accurately.
[00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:02.188]  I think it's important to recap those.
[00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.569]  I could go over some of them, but you could do it better than I, because you made them.
[00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:19.255]  And then, so people take seriously what you're saying, let's move forward, then, into your forecast on the Depression, and exactly why that's being exacerbated and accelerated by the policies.
[00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:25.016]  Basically, I've been pointing out for a number of years the underlying problems with our economy.
[00:09:25.036 --> 00:09:26.777]  What we're experiencing now
[00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:42.597]  It's not the problem.
[00:09:42.637 --> 00:09:46.158]  What we're finally experiencing are the consequences of the problem.
[00:09:46.198 --> 00:09:49.299]  And the problem has been building, as I said, for years and years.
[00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:56.900]  And basically, you know, the roots of the problem, you can probably trace them back to abandoning the gold standard in 1971.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:09.183]  Because when we took the dollar off the gold standard, and the world continued to accept the US dollar as a reserve currency, as if it were still backed by gold, that put us in a unique position as a nation
[00:10:09.645 --> 00:10:12.146]  Well, we could pay for our imports by printing money.
[00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:17.289]  We didn't have to pay for our imports with exports, and we didn't have to pay for them with gold.
[00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:18.450]  We could just print money.
[00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.453]  And that really started this process that culminated after the dot-coms, I think, from 2001, 2002, until 2008.
[00:10:23.493 --> 00:10:25.514]  We basically went through the blow-off stage of this phony economy.
[00:10:34.406 --> 00:10:48.696]  But what happened is we began to de-industrialize, and we began to move into a service sector economy, because we were able to import all the things that we didn't produce by printing money and sending it abroad, and our creditors were willing to hang on to the money we printed.
[00:10:49.336 --> 00:10:56.641]  And they didn't look to actually spend it on real stuff, and so the economy began to evolve as this consumer-based economy.
[00:10:56.981 --> 00:11:04.186]  But in order to keep it growing, we had to keep on taking on ever-increasing quantities of debt, which the world was willing to supply us.
[00:11:05.126 --> 00:11:12.409]  And, of course, with the housing bubble, when I was very critical there, that's what enabled Americans to borrow money on an unprecedented scale.
[00:11:12.469 --> 00:11:21.552]  I mean, we raised it to an art form, where we were borrowing literally trillions of dollars from the world, and we were just blowing it all on massive consumption.
[00:11:21.612 --> 00:11:28.815]  And our trade deficit during this decade went from what used to be a pretty bad $10-12 billion a month up to $60 billion, $70 billion a month.
[00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:33.037]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:56.346]  I knew that our whole banking system was a house of cards because I knew that the assets were money.
[00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:58.227]  Because the assets were mortgages.
[00:11:58.528 --> 00:12:02.351]  And I knew that the people who were borrowing money, there's no way they could pay it back.
[00:12:02.752 --> 00:12:03.893]  Sorry to interrupt you.
[00:12:03.933 --> 00:12:04.894]  Your voice is so strong.
[00:12:04.914 --> 00:12:05.835]  Will you back off your phone?
[00:12:06.983 --> 00:12:07.483]  Okay, sure.
[00:12:07.823 --> 00:12:08.123]  Thank you.
[00:12:08.143 --> 00:12:10.024]  Sorry to interrupt you.
[00:12:10.324 --> 00:12:10.964]  Absolutely.
[00:12:11.644 --> 00:12:21.408]  And then on top of that, the big banks and brokerage firms then took the security-backed assets, the mortgage loans, and sold those as basically good as gold.
[00:12:22.228 --> 00:12:25.029]  Well, yeah, they had to sell them because we don't have any savings.
[00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:32.611]  I mean, this whole securitization process was a way to put together American borrowers with all the world's savers.
[00:12:32.631 --> 00:12:35.452]  I mean, you can only borrow money from somebody who saved it.
[00:12:36.115 --> 00:12:42.238]  And so, this process enabled Wall Street to put the Japanese and the Chinese together with the Americans.
[00:12:42.598 --> 00:12:44.639]  But all we were doing was borrowing money.
[00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:47.601]  And, you know, the Chinese, they were dumb enough to lend it to us.
[00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:49.261]  They thought they were going to get it back.
[00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:52.183]  But, you know, they're not going to get it back because we spent the money.
[00:12:52.443 --> 00:12:53.723]  We have no way of paying it back.
[00:12:53.783 --> 00:12:56.185]  It wasn't put to a productive use.
[00:12:56.245 --> 00:12:56.865]  It was spent.
[00:12:57.662 --> 00:13:07.609]  But anyway, so I knew that this was going to end badly, this phony credit-bubbled economy based on consumer spending and debt was going to collapse, and that's what's begun.
[00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:27.443]  Now, when I was warning about it, I was more fearful, not of the collapse, but of the things that the government would do to try to interfere with the collapse, to try to reflate the bubble, to try to return us to the consumer-spending economy that is the source of our problems.
[00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:30.622]  And that is exactly what the government is trying to do.
[00:13:31.162 --> 00:13:44.247]  And in so doing, what they're really doing is pouring gasoline on a raging fire, and it is going to basically engulf the entire country and burn it to the ground.
[00:13:44.947 --> 00:13:48.308]  And every time the fire gets bigger, they're going to pour more gasoline on it.
[00:13:48.669 --> 00:13:52.610]  What we need, the only way that America is going to get back on the right track,
[00:13:53.237 --> 00:13:56.098]  is to have consumers stop spending.
[00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.858]  We need to rebuild savings.
[00:13:58.198 --> 00:14:09.141]  We need capital to be made available to business, not government, so that business can use it to produce the factories of the future, to employ the workers that are losing their jobs and services and finance.
[00:14:09.522 --> 00:14:21.885]  We need to allow the free market to work, and it's going to involve a lot of pain, because all this artificial living, all this living beyond our means and indulging our every whim and buying things we can't afford, that's got to come to an end.
[00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:24.872]  And it's not going to be an easy process.
[00:14:24.992 --> 00:14:27.994]  And during the process, asset prices are going to be marked down.
[00:14:28.294 --> 00:14:29.755]  Stock prices need to go lower.
[00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:32.796]  Real estate prices need to go lower.
[00:14:32.876 --> 00:14:37.579]  That's not going to sit well with a lot of people who thought they were going to get rich on asset appreciation.
[00:14:38.072 --> 00:14:39.792]  But we need to go back to reality.
[00:14:40.072 --> 00:14:43.593]  But what the government is going to do is they're going to prevent all this from happening.
[00:14:43.813 --> 00:14:45.734]  They're going to prevent us from getting out of this hole.
[00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:46.774]  They're going to dig it deeper.
[00:14:47.034 --> 00:14:49.675]  They're trying to encourage more reckless consumption.
[00:14:49.995 --> 00:14:59.997]  The entire purpose of the stimulus package and all the bailouts is to keep Americans going to the mall, to keep us reaching for our charge cards, buying more stuff.
[00:15:00.217 --> 00:15:02.537]  They want us borrowing more money to buy more houses.
[00:15:02.577 --> 00:15:04.718]  They want us borrowing more money to buy more cars.
[00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:12.056]  That is the exact opposite of what we need to do, and what they are setting up is the real crisis that I've been warning about.
[00:15:12.696 --> 00:15:14.698]  It's going to be a collapse in the value of the dollar.
[00:15:14.798 --> 00:15:15.338]  It's coming.
[00:15:15.418 --> 00:15:20.963]  It's coming soon, and when the dollar collapses, you're going to see interest rates spiral out of control.
[00:15:21.243 --> 00:15:25.887]  You're going to see consumer prices spiraling out of control, and then we're going to be in a real crisis.
[00:15:26.229 --> 00:15:30.092]  Because see, right now, the government is bailing everybody out and easing the pain.
[00:15:30.392 --> 00:15:32.734]  But when the bond market collapses, it's the U.S.
[00:15:32.774 --> 00:15:36.097]  government that's going to need to bail out, and there's nobody big enough to do it.
[00:15:36.457 --> 00:15:38.579]  Peter Schiff, what is the timeframe?
[00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:43.783]  And I know these are liquid and move back and forth, but most of the experts we talk to
[00:15:44.523 --> 00:16:03.213]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Bob Chapman and the head of the Newark Business School and countless others say that what government is doing is accelerating the time frame and bringing the total collapse, what I call hyper-stag inflation, closer to reality.
[00:16:04.314 --> 00:16:08.256]  Yeah, it's hard to say exactly timing.
[00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:13.739]  Timing is a very difficult thing to do, especially when there's so much irrationality.
[00:16:14.221 --> 00:16:14.821]  We're good to go.
[00:16:44.249 --> 00:16:49.351]  But once this dollar rally really loses steam and begins to fall apart, it's going to take on a lot of momentum.
[00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:51.151]  And that's starting to happen.
[00:16:52.031 --> 00:16:54.332]  Yeah, look at the bond market.
[00:16:54.352 --> 00:16:56.873]  The bond market has been dropping every day this year.
[00:16:57.053 --> 00:17:03.295]  In fact, so far, 2009 is the worst year in history for the U.S.
[00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:03.855]  bond market.
[00:17:03.895 --> 00:17:06.936]  It's the worst year, even though we've only finished one month of the year.
[00:17:07.336 --> 00:17:10.257]  And if this continues, this could be the beginning of the unraveling.
[00:17:10.757 --> 00:17:12.698]  And the worst year in stocks ever.
[00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:16.037]  Well, it's the worst January in stocks ever, yes.
[00:17:16.177 --> 00:17:17.318]  But it's not the worst year.
[00:17:17.999 --> 00:17:20.021]  But it's already the worst year in bonds.
[00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:24.085]  I mean, January was worse than any entire year that preceded it.
[00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:25.066]  That's how bad it was.
[00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:43.628]  What's the furthest it could be pushed out until, I mean, the layoffs, hundreds of thousands a month, the store shutdowns, and now the bubble in the real estate market is starting to implode, the credit card debt is starting to implode.
[00:17:43.648 --> 00:17:54.196]  I mean, is all these things combined with the already circling black hole, what, a year till riots in the streets?
[00:17:54.256 --> 00:17:54.697]  Two years?
[00:17:56.016 --> 00:17:56.456]  I don't know.
[00:17:56.476 --> 00:18:10.887]  I mean, I've talked about the potential for riots, and I think that exists, and looting, and I think what would cause that would be shortages of food and blackouts, and I think that it is possible that we will see that, because the government is unleashing massive inflation.
[00:18:11.247 --> 00:18:18.612]  And ultimately, the inflation that they're creating is going to cause surging prices, particularly for things like food and energy.
[00:18:19.073 --> 00:18:22.235]  And if the government is going to stick to form,
[00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.832]  They are going to attack the symptoms and not the disease, which is the rising prices.
[00:18:27.912 --> 00:18:34.875]  And the only way governments ever attack rising prices is through price controls, which is what we did in the 1970s.
[00:18:34.955 --> 00:18:40.577]  And since we're repeating all the mistakes of the 1930s, I'm sure we'll repeat the mistakes of the 1970s.
[00:18:41.197 --> 00:18:44.078]  And if we have price controls, we're going to have shortages.
[00:18:44.239 --> 00:18:46.519]  And if we have shortages, we're going to have problems.
[00:18:46.599 --> 00:18:47.520]  We're going to have crime.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.241]  And of course, I think it's going to come at a time
[00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:57.115]  You know, where the cities are not going to have the money and the resources to pay for additional police protection.
[00:18:57.175 --> 00:19:01.200]  If not, they might have to cut back on the police protection they have now.
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.984]  And obviously, you know, the criminals will figure that out.
[00:19:04.332 --> 00:19:05.853]  Well, Peter, that was my next question.
[00:19:05.873 --> 00:19:07.113]  When we come back, I want to get into that.
[00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:09.955]  The states are on the verge of bankruptcy.
[00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:21.901]  CalPERS, for those that don't know, the big pension fund system in California, formerly one of the biggest economies in the world, with number eight in the world itself, just that fund, not California itself, but just the fund.
[00:19:22.821 --> 00:19:24.382]  They're talking about that going bankrupt.
[00:19:24.422 --> 00:19:27.923]  They're doing emergency rainy day funds just to continue the checks going out.
[00:19:28.324 --> 00:19:30.385]  The welfare checks are in danger of not going out.
[00:19:30.685 --> 00:19:31.945]  That'll be a riot within a week.
[00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:33.146]  The Pentagon has
[00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:35.168]  We'll also get into a lot of other issues as well.
[00:19:35.188 --> 00:19:35.428]  Stay with us.

[00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:08.913]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:09.293 --> 00:21:10.974]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:12.112 --> 00:21:12.973]  Who is the enemy?
[00:21:13.473 --> 00:21:13.973]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.234]  This is his M.O.
[00:21:15.254 --> 00:21:16.575]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:16.635 --> 00:21:18.256]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:18.636 --> 00:21:25.380]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.220]  Some U.S.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.944]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:32.604 --> 00:21:36.146]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:36.486 --> 00:21:46.351]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:46.591 --> 00:21:47.331]  Fabled enemies.

[00:22:40.387 --> 00:22:42.108]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:13.565]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:23:14.206 --> 00:23:17.810]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.734]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[00:23:22.215 --> 00:23:26.800]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of
[00:23:31.732 --> 00:23:32.513]  We're good to go.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.962]  Europac.net is our guest website.
[00:24:18.022 --> 00:24:24.405]  Europac.net is also a gorgeous website, pushing him for president that fans have put up.
[00:24:25.045 --> 00:24:29.548]  This is one of the guys that Ron Paul has said is one of the people he learns a lot from.
[00:24:29.728 --> 00:24:31.569]  Peter Schiff, again, is our guest.
[00:24:32.609 --> 00:24:34.590]  Peter, let's get into it right now.
[00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.871]  You talked about police agencies not having enough money.
[00:24:37.571 --> 00:24:42.874]  They swole the size of police agencies from 500,000 to several million in the last decade.
[00:24:44.455 --> 00:24:47.996]  Now the police admit they're outriding more tickets and fines and fees to try to raise money.
[00:24:48.036 --> 00:24:52.599]  But of the people, you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip or a stone, as the old sayings go.
[00:24:53.699 --> 00:24:58.601]  The states are talking about going bankrupt, the pension funds, the state pension funds, the police pension funds.
[00:24:59.342 --> 00:25:03.664]  I mean, if all of that goes bankrupt, what are we, or even part of it, what are we looking at here?
[00:25:04.164 --> 00:25:05.504]  Yeah, look, it's tough.
[00:25:05.524 --> 00:25:13.908]  Look, this is the natural consequence of all this debt, all this borrowing to consume, and that's how come, you know, our economy was phony.
[00:25:13.928 --> 00:25:17.650]  We were paying for it by going into debt, and everybody
[00:25:18.106 --> 00:25:25.153]  You know, when I would bring this up and talk about all the debt, people would criticize me by saying, look, I'm only looking at half the balance sheet.
[00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:27.195]  I'm not looking at all the assets.
[00:25:27.255 --> 00:25:29.737]  And so we have all these assets, so the debt is okay.
[00:25:30.017 --> 00:25:31.158]  Well, what were the assets?
[00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:33.721]  The assets were stocks and real estate.
[00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:36.083]  But what good are those assets?
[00:25:36.103 --> 00:25:39.186]  I mean, we can hock them all to the Chinese.
[00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:41.386]  You know, we have to pay interest on the debt.
[00:25:41.766 --> 00:25:45.548]  And if we can't service the debt, it doesn't matter about the assets.
[00:25:45.788 --> 00:25:49.070]  And of course, when you have to sell your assets, the prices collapse.
[00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:53.172]  I mean, our houses are only worth a lot of money, assuming that nobody wants to sell them.
[00:25:53.872 --> 00:25:57.073]  But the minute everybody needs to sell their house, there's nobody to buy it.
[00:25:57.134 --> 00:25:57.934]  What's your house worth?
[00:25:58.034 --> 00:26:03.256]  It's worth a fraction of what we were pretending it was worth when we tried to pretend that all this debt didn't matter.
[00:26:03.737 --> 00:26:04.657]  But it does matter.
[00:26:04.917 --> 00:26:07.158]  And now the bills are coming due and we can't pay.
[00:26:07.619 --> 00:26:08.279]  In the meantime,
[00:26:08.717 --> 00:26:15.487]  You know, what made us wealthy in the first place, our industrial might, our ability to produce, you know, that's gone!
[00:26:15.727 --> 00:26:19.593]  Because we've been living off the productivity of everybody else, as we've been accumulating all his debt!
[00:26:22.819 --> 00:26:27.560]  Looking specifically at CalPERS out in California and other states, where do you see the biggest problems?
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.661]  What do you see to be the next domino to fall?
[00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.401]  States going bankrupt?
[00:26:31.461 --> 00:26:35.242]  I saw a headline in mainstream news yesterday of 48 states going into bankruptcy.
[00:26:35.702 --> 00:26:42.583]  Yeah, I think California is on the verge, if they haven't already done so, of paying some of their bills with IOUs.
[00:26:43.744 --> 00:26:48.865]  Ultimately, I think Barack Obama and the government have mentioned a desire to
[00:26:49.898 --> 00:27:02.162]  Give money to the states, and I think some of this new bailout bill, stimulus bill, whatever they call it, if they're passing, I think it has some money for the states, so that the states don't have to make cuts.
[00:27:02.703 --> 00:27:04.643]  Well, that's the wrong thing to do.
[00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:06.204]  The states need to make cuts.
[00:27:06.584 --> 00:27:07.624]  The states are bloated.
[00:27:08.645 --> 00:27:10.645]  You know, we need reductions there.
[00:27:10.925 --> 00:27:15.247]  If we're just going to print money and give it to the states so they don't make necessary cuts,
[00:27:15.686 --> 00:27:17.867]  We're just making the underlying problems worse.
[00:27:18.347 --> 00:27:21.449]  And that's just going to inflate the currency more, isn't it?
[00:27:21.489 --> 00:27:22.609]  Well, that's all they're doing.
[00:27:22.649 --> 00:27:23.469]  They have to print money.
[00:27:23.509 --> 00:27:35.215]  Now, they're hoping that they can keep borrowing the money from the Chinese and the Japanese and the Saudis, but the world is suffering right now from all the money they loaned us in the past that we can't pay back.
[00:27:35.275 --> 00:27:37.556]  Why should they sign up to loan us even more?
[00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:39.797]  Could it get to Zimbabwean level?
[00:27:41.037 --> 00:27:41.537]  It could.
[00:27:41.878 --> 00:27:44.399]  I mean, there's no difference between our money and theirs.
[00:27:44.479 --> 00:27:45.139]  It's just paper.
[00:27:46.515 --> 00:27:51.718]  I'm hoping it doesn't get that bad, but it will get that bad if we do not change course.
[00:27:51.798 --> 00:28:03.726]  We need to make a conscious decision to reverse our course and to accept whatever pain the recession is going to dole out, because there's no way around it.
[00:28:04.566 --> 00:28:08.429]  It's trying to avoid the pain, trying to accept from dealing with reality.
[00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:14.553]  That's why you end up with a hyperinflation scenario, because you refuse to bite the bullet.
[00:28:15.296 --> 00:28:17.858]  And so instead you died from the wound.
[00:28:45.629 --> 00:28:47.050]  Build more golf courses?
[00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.491]  I mean, they've got to be crazy!
[00:28:49.031 --> 00:28:51.933]  How is another golf course going to make us more productive?
[00:28:52.354 --> 00:28:53.334]  We need a factory.
[00:28:53.575 --> 00:28:54.455]  We need to make things.
[00:28:54.495 --> 00:28:55.876]  We don't need more golf courses.
[00:28:55.896 --> 00:28:57.537]  You know, we've got plenty of golf courses.
[00:28:58.718 --> 00:29:00.980]  Well, people aren't going to have money to spend at the golf course.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.723]  Well, we don't have the money to build the golf courses.
[00:29:05.064 --> 00:29:08.388]  How are we going to use the golf courses to pay for our exports?
[00:29:08.428 --> 00:29:12.072]  Are the Japanese really going to fly over here to play golf in our courses?
[00:29:12.633 --> 00:29:14.915]  This is nonsense!
[00:29:14.995 --> 00:29:17.378]  Also, this is a global implosion.
[00:29:17.699 --> 00:29:19.120]  Japan is on the edge of the abyss.
[00:29:19.821 --> 00:29:23.523]  And Russia's plunging into it, China's growth rate projected to go from 10% to 4%.
[00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:42.282]  I mean, it's actually in there for yacht marinas, so they are going to do that.
[00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:46.663]  Because, you know, they've stolen all this money from us, they're going to need to park their yacht somewhere.
[00:29:47.143 --> 00:29:48.483]  Peter Schiff, stay with us.
[00:29:49.023 --> 00:29:51.044]  We'll be right back with more key information and your calls.
[00:29:53.084 --> 00:29:53.965]  We're on the march.

[00:29:57.005 --> 00:29:59.686]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:08.893]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:31:08.913 --> 00:31:10.134]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:31:10.154 --> 00:31:11.716]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:14.659]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:31:14.719 --> 00:31:18.363]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:31:28.011 --> 00:31:32.882]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:31:36.676 --> 00:31:37.757]  How dare you?
[00:31:37.897 --> 00:31:44.163]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.

[00:33:05.177 --> 00:33:11.219]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:11.819 --> 00:33:14.780]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.635 --> 00:33:24.899]  TheObamadeception.net, that's our new website for the Obama film that I'm making.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:33.845]  Your phone call is coming up here in a few minutes with Peter Schiff, acclaimed economic researcher, writer, and of course he also manages a multi-billion dollar fund.
[00:33:34.726 --> 00:33:35.266]  Mr. Schiff,
[00:33:37.822 --> 00:33:44.427]  Specifically Barack Obama, whether he's a nice guy or a bad guy, we know he's appointing more globalists, more of the same people.
[00:33:44.747 --> 00:34:01.240]  Timothy Geithner, who engineered much of the economic crises we now see, who lobbied to get rid of the different acts in the 1990s that allowed all of this derivative manipulation to expand, as you know, but for the audience,
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:15.527]  He is now coming out and saying Obama warns of catastrophe without stimulus, without these, literally here in Austin, Frisbee golf courses.
[00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:17.716]  You couldn't make this up.
[00:34:18.796 --> 00:34:19.617]  Yacht clubs.
[00:34:21.078 --> 00:34:22.179]  Political payoffs.
[00:34:22.279 --> 00:34:23.400]  Buying off churches.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.261]  I mean, this is just a big political payoff.
[00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:26.322]  The biggest pork ever seen.
[00:34:26.642 --> 00:34:31.385]  Of course, it's this $900 billion is a distraction compared to the trillions the Federal Reserve has taken.
[00:34:31.425 --> 00:34:33.426]  They won't say where it's gone, but I want you to talk about that separately.
[00:34:34.367 --> 00:34:35.268]  Barack Obama.
[00:34:36.189 --> 00:34:37.470]  A, what do you think of what he's doing?
[00:34:38.592 --> 00:34:40.393]  He lobbied for the original banker bailout.
[00:34:40.413 --> 00:34:42.275]  Now he's criticizing the banker bailout.
[00:34:42.315 --> 00:34:43.957]  I mean, how hypocritical is that?
[00:34:44.017 --> 00:34:52.185]  Him claiming he's not involved in the October 3rd banker bailout, but he was actually instrumental in honchoing it through Congress.
[00:34:52.766 --> 00:34:54.888]  We have the video clips to prove it of him on the floor of the Senate.
[00:34:55.448 --> 00:34:56.790]  And where do you see all this going?
[00:34:57.563 --> 00:34:58.524]  These guys have the guts.
[00:34:59.164 --> 00:35:01.666]  I mean, McCain, I was on Kudlow's show yesterday.
[00:35:01.706 --> 00:35:04.388]  McCain was on and, you know, he's talking against the bailout.
[00:35:04.408 --> 00:35:08.751]  But, I mean, he made a point that he stopped his campaign to go back to Washington to vote for it.
[00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:11.052]  And, you know, and now he's against it.
[00:35:11.092 --> 00:35:13.114]  But, you know, first I just want to correct something that you said.
[00:35:13.174 --> 00:35:14.454]  I don't manage a fund.
[00:35:14.494 --> 00:35:15.155]  I don't.
[00:35:15.295 --> 00:35:17.556]  I own a brokerage firm, Europe Pacific Capital.
[00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:18.857]  We're a brokerage firm.
[00:35:18.897 --> 00:35:21.139]  Individual investors, you know, put up accounts with me.
[00:35:21.159 --> 00:35:25.542]  They can invest in foreign stocks, domestic stocks if they want, with self-precious metals.
[00:35:25.922 --> 00:35:28.583]  But we're just a full-service retail investment firm.
[00:35:28.603 --> 00:35:30.403]  I don't manage any money at all.
[00:35:30.583 --> 00:35:32.024]  Got it.
[00:35:32.144 --> 00:35:36.545]  Anyway, although I am starting, I just actually set up a registered investment advisor.
[00:35:36.585 --> 00:35:42.867]  So it is my intention to start managing money, but I haven't managed any to date, except my own.
[00:35:43.387 --> 00:35:52.790]  But in any event, what's happening right now with Obama and government in general is they are using this economic crisis
[00:35:53.516 --> 00:35:54.197]  I don't know.
[00:36:12.529 --> 00:36:13.930]  The crisis is going to get worse.
[00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.872]  The more government we get, the bigger the problem.
[00:36:16.972 --> 00:36:19.593]  And of course, that is exactly what the government wants.
[00:36:19.853 --> 00:36:26.157]  The worse they make the economy, the more justification they have to get even more powerful and even more government.
[00:36:26.357 --> 00:36:27.478]  So they can't lose.
[00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:28.678]  The politicians can't lose.
[00:36:28.939 --> 00:36:31.060]  The worse they make it, the better they off they are.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.181]  Peter, say that again in your own words.
[00:36:33.221 --> 00:36:34.402]  You're really overdriving the phone.
[00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:35.423]  I need you to back off again.
[00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:36.183]  I'm sorry to stop you.
[00:36:36.744 --> 00:36:37.724]  I mean, flesh that out.
[00:36:37.764 --> 00:36:40.206]  Take your time explaining that, because that's key.
[00:36:40.226 --> 00:36:44.309]  And explain why this is actually good for them, but not for the rest of us.
[00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:45.369]  Go ahead.
[00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:46.070]  Right.
[00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:50.633]  Well, if you look at the government, government is like a parasite or a cancer.
[00:36:50.753 --> 00:36:52.454]  And the rest of us are the host.
[00:36:52.534 --> 00:36:56.356]  And what's good for the parasite is not necessarily good for the host.
[00:36:56.697 --> 00:37:00.099]  They want to get bigger, and they're going to feed off of us.
[00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:07.721]  And the more government they create to solve the problem, the bigger the problem is going to become.
[00:37:08.362 --> 00:37:15.105]  And so the worse they make the economy, the more they create the need for government solutions to solve it.
[00:37:15.565 --> 00:37:20.367]  And so the government can't lose in this situation, unless, of course, we vote them out.
[00:37:20.707 --> 00:37:22.148]  But in general, we won't do that.
[00:37:22.168 --> 00:37:23.389]  I mean, Roosevelt proved that.
[00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:28.151]  He got elected, what, four times, despite the fact that he kept making the situation worse.
[00:37:28.464 --> 00:37:36.107]  Because he got the voters so fearful that the only thing standing between them and starvation was Roosevelt and the big government.
[00:37:36.448 --> 00:37:43.551]  And so, the worse they can make the economy and the more dependent we think we are on government, the less likely we are to throw them out.
[00:37:43.791 --> 00:37:48.813]  It's like, you know, they're the slaves and they're the masters and they make the slaves think that we're dependent on them.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:59.626]  This is a very dangerous time to be an American, because they are going to seize a lot of control and a lot of power, and we're going to lose a lot of individual liberties that we may never get back.
[00:37:59.666 --> 00:38:16.157]  Our economy is going to continue to move away from a market-based economy to a centrally planned economy, and economic decisions and resources are going to be allocated and invested not based on individual entrepreneurs seeking profits, but politicians seeking votes.
[00:38:16.644 --> 00:38:20.534]  And this is not how to have a vibrant, efficient economy where living standards grow.
[00:38:20.895 --> 00:38:22.498]  This is the recipe for disaster.
[00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:30.080]  This has not been the free market or American way and that brings me specifically to the fact they blame this on the free market.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:46.853]  They say the free market did this and then Gordon Brown and Barack Obama come out and say we have to merge the free market with government socialism with more regulation when they didn't even follow their own regulations and when the government paid corporations tax incentives to move offshore
[00:38:47.834 --> 00:38:54.920]  So, I mean, all of this being set up, and now they come in to the rescue for a problem they engineered to begin with.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:02.726]  Yeah, it's always, you know, the free market always takes the blame when you introduce government into the market.
[00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:04.768]  And then there's a problem.
[00:39:04.848 --> 00:39:09.151]  It's always the capitalism that gets the blame, but it's not capitalism.
[00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:10.852]  It's the government mixed in.
[00:39:10.892 --> 00:39:12.914]  It's the mixture of socialism and capitalism.
[00:39:12.954 --> 00:39:14.075]  Capitalism doesn't work.
[00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:23.770]  When government interferes, I mean, there are a lot of natural forces that make capitalism work, but the government comes in and gets in the way of those forces.
[00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:34.816]  It circumvents them, and it leads to the excess of risk-taking and the excess of leverage that never would have come into existence if it were not for government intervention.
[00:39:34.836 --> 00:39:43.180]  And of course, they come into the market and they subsidize something and they tax something else, so they interfere with rational decision-making.
[00:39:44.454 --> 00:39:52.161]  They micromanage, and they cause businesses and individuals to do things that, absent government regulation, they wouldn't have done.
[00:39:53.342 --> 00:39:55.965]  And so they blow up all these bubbles, and then the bubbles burst.
[00:39:56.285 --> 00:40:00.349]  And then when we have a problem, they say, ah, you see, it's because of capitalism.
[00:40:00.649 --> 00:40:05.554]  If it was really a capitalist economy, we never would have had the bubbles, and so they would never have to burst.
[00:40:06.331 --> 00:40:08.973]  Peter, I specifically want you to speak to Obama, though.
[00:40:09.313 --> 00:40:28.844]  I mean, what was it like for you to watch him on television helping ram through the banker takeover bill that gave him all these trillions in anonymity and secrecy, and then months later they're saying, we've got to have another bailout now, and he's on TV criticizing the bankers and brokerage firms for giving themselves record bonuses.
[00:40:28.884 --> 00:40:31.586]  I mean, how stupid does he think the public is?
[00:40:31.946 --> 00:40:35.748]  It's like, what did they think they were going to do with that money?
[00:40:36.894 --> 00:40:37.074]  Right?
[00:40:37.114 --> 00:40:38.855]  I mean, what did they think they were going to do with it?
[00:40:38.895 --> 00:40:40.916]  I mean, you know, they gave them a bunch of money.
[00:40:40.936 --> 00:40:42.596]  They didn't think they were going to pay themselves.
[00:40:42.896 --> 00:40:43.136]  You know?
[00:40:43.897 --> 00:40:45.617]  I mean, that's how these guys work.
[00:40:47.298 --> 00:40:49.199]  You know, so it's amazing.
[00:40:49.259 --> 00:40:56.481]  It's like, you know, you're playing with a snake and the snake bites you and you're surprised.
[00:40:57.142 --> 00:41:05.385]  But more than that, Obama got, depending on which index you look at, Obama got four times the Wall Street money that John McCain got
[00:41:05.905 --> 00:41:07.406]  Yeah, well look, this is how politicians are.
[00:41:07.426 --> 00:41:07.946]  That's politics.
[00:41:29.045 --> 00:41:36.890]  You know, the economic problems that were a consequence of bad government policy, mainly the Federal Reserve.
[00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:42.193]  I mean, look at all the new powers that the Federal Reserve has now, specifically because of the problems that they helped create.
[00:41:42.654 --> 00:41:48.737]  You know, it's like, you know, all we do is we turn over the keys of the asylum to the inmates, and that's what's going on.
[00:41:49.938 --> 00:41:53.941]  You made a point earlier, but I'd like you to expand on that, and then we're going to take some phone calls.
[00:41:54.966 --> 00:41:56.526]  That they love what's happening.
[00:41:58.287 --> 00:42:01.688]  That the fact that the crisis is deepening allows them to expand their powers.
[00:42:02.388 --> 00:42:03.228]  Flesh that out a bit.
[00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:07.089]  Well, I mean, this is what happens with government.
[00:42:07.189 --> 00:42:12.931]  I mean, government, you know, they can grow when there is a crisis or an emergency.
[00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:21.353]  I mean, if you look at all throughout history, all the additional powers that the government usurped over the years, all the new taxes that they were able to pass,
[00:42:21.747 --> 00:42:24.728]  It was always during some type of crisis, some type of emergency.
[00:42:25.128 --> 00:42:26.209]  In general, it's a war.
[00:42:26.429 --> 00:42:35.113]  You know, and the governments are generally able to do things in wartime that they can never do in peacetime, because people don't oppose them, because they always make it about the war.
[00:42:35.513 --> 00:42:40.635]  And therefore, anybody who opposes what they're doing is, you know, they're trying to make it about, well, they don't care.
[00:42:40.655 --> 00:42:45.277]  I mean, or, you know, how can you oppose new taxes when there are people dying, you know, in a war?
[00:42:45.297 --> 00:42:47.698]  I mean, at least you're not, you know, you're not on the front.
[00:42:48.118 --> 00:42:49.119]  Mr. Schiff, was it economic terrorism?
[00:43:13.812 --> 00:43:29.695]  Mr. Schiff, I see it as economic terrorism to have Barack Obama, John McCain and others cheerleading around on television back in October of 2008 saying you've got to pass the banker takeover bailout bill or we're going to have a depression next week.
[00:43:30.135 --> 00:43:39.477]  And then they pass the bill on Friday, Bush signs it on Saturday, and the Treasury Secretary says now we're not using it to unclog the subprime mortgages and the derivatives.
[00:43:41.157 --> 00:43:43.298]  We're not going to tell you what we're going to spend it for.
[00:43:43.318 --> 00:43:45.939]  I mean, now they're back terrorizing us again.
[00:43:45.959 --> 00:43:52.800]  Yeah, I mean, it was really, it was really basically a bait and switch, is what it was, you know, the whole time.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.821]  And, you know, I criticized the plan when they first proposed it.
[00:43:56.841 --> 00:44:04.843]  I said it wouldn't work because it was impossible to buy these troubled assets because you'd have to overpay for them, otherwise you would bankrupt all the entities you were trying to
[00:44:05.399 --> 00:44:07.880]  Bail out, so there's no way the government can make a profit on it.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:22.443]  But if you remember the way they sold it to us, you know, when it didn't pass and the Dow Jones dropped about 1,000 points, I think it went from 13,000 to 12,000 or something, they said, aha, you see, the Dow collapsed because we didn't pass it, so now we need to pass it to help the stock market.
[00:44:22.723 --> 00:44:25.884]  Well, they passed it, and the Dow is less than 8,000 right now.
[00:44:26.264 --> 00:44:31.885]  So, obviously, they tried to convince us that we needed to pass that bill because we had to get the stock market to go back up.
[00:44:32.645 --> 00:44:35.546]  But, you know, look where the stock market is now, even though we have the bill.
[00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:51.308]  And now they're claiming that the American people are on the hook for these trillions and trillions of dollars in interest to the very banks that we loan the money to, and then the banks, the big international banks, won't tell Congress where the money is.
[00:44:53.649 --> 00:45:00.450]  Yeah, I mean, look, I mean, there's no transparency here in this process, and the whole thing is it's co-opted.
[00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:01.950]  I mean, right now there's a big debate
[00:45:02.595 --> 00:45:08.398]  Over executive pay and bonuses and, you know, can companies take government money and then pay big bonuses?
[00:45:08.458 --> 00:45:15.942]  And, you know, this is a debate that we shouldn't even have because it shouldn't even be an issue because none of these companies should have got any government money in the first place.
[00:45:16.222 --> 00:45:17.703]  They should have been allowed to go bankrupt.
[00:45:17.983 --> 00:45:25.287]  But now we bail them out and now we have the government getting involved in the decision making, you know, versus pay.
[00:45:25.607 --> 00:45:28.509]  Now they're telling some of these companies they have to cancel some of these
[00:45:29.134 --> 00:45:29.995]  I don't think so.
[00:45:50.134 --> 00:45:51.435]  Let's expand on that.
[00:45:51.695 --> 00:45:58.138]  Look what happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with quasi-government control, and they say that's one of the big sources of all of this.
[00:45:58.158 --> 00:46:02.961]  They're saying they're going to give bailouts to auto companies, but then control even who they can sell a car to.
[00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:14.687]  So we see the entire economy basically being taken over by government, and then through extension... And the crazy thing about it is they're saying, look, we want to put strings on the money that we give to Ford and General Motors.
[00:46:15.003 --> 00:46:16.805]  We want to tell them how to make cars.
[00:46:17.285 --> 00:46:19.947]  We want them to make fuel-efficient cars or something like that.
[00:46:20.308 --> 00:46:26.653]  So, somehow, Washington, D.C., these guys can't even make a profit running the post office.
[00:46:27.674 --> 00:46:36.822]  Somehow we're going to put the people who are in charge of the post office in charge of the auto industry, and somehow they're going to do a better job than the people who have been running it in the past.
[00:46:36.862 --> 00:46:37.903]  I mean, come on, give me a break!
[00:46:39.717 --> 00:46:42.840]  The government doesn't have a clue what kind of cars people should make.
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.762]  They don't even know how to make a car at a profit.
[00:46:44.942 --> 00:46:52.189]  These are decisions that need to be made in the free market by entrepreneurs that have a risk of losing money.
[00:46:53.513 --> 00:47:09.210]  Peter, I want to go to calls here in the last 10-15 minutes with you, but before we do that, briefly, they know things are imploding, they know they're collapsing, and then as you said, they're going to be able to consolidate the power and actually use this crisis for themselves at the expense of our civilization, it appears.
[00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:14.956]  The 20,000 troops that NORTHCOM says they want to use against the American people, the Army War College saying they're getting ready.
[00:47:15.797 --> 00:47:17.159]  to engage the American people.
[00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:18.840]  These are amazing developments.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:24.866]  A bill's introduced to merge local police into FEMA centers and FEMA camps for mass relocation.
[00:47:25.947 --> 00:47:29.371]  I mean, this is the stuff of conspiracy theory, but it's now front-page news.
[00:47:29.391 --> 00:47:36.938]  The Wall Street Journal came out last week and said the answer to the imploding economy is a new bubble into a North American union in a marrow.
[00:47:37.399 --> 00:47:38.360]  So, your take on that?
[00:47:39.562 --> 00:47:41.522]  I mean, I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:47:41.562 --> 00:47:42.623]  I mean, who knows?
[00:47:42.703 --> 00:47:48.824]  I mean, I think there's a lot of rumors there and, you know, conspiracy theories, but I don't think the Canadians would be stupid enough to go for it.
[00:47:49.964 --> 00:47:52.225]  And I don't think the Canadian citizens would go for it.
[00:47:52.245 --> 00:47:53.925]  I mean, there's a lot of resentment of the U.S.
[00:47:53.985 --> 00:47:56.166]  So, number one, I don't think Canada's going to do it.
[00:47:56.186 --> 00:47:59.427]  So, you know, I don't know that we're going to have a union with Mexico.
[00:47:59.487 --> 00:48:04.488]  I mean, I just don't, you know, a union, the U.S., you know, coming together with Mexico.
[00:48:04.528 --> 00:48:05.388]  I don't know.
[00:48:05.408 --> 00:48:08.769]  It just doesn't, I don't even think that that's in the cards.
[00:48:09.434 --> 00:48:10.795]  Well, they're now proposing.
[00:48:10.895 --> 00:48:14.799]  I think there's more of a chance of our union breaking up.
[00:48:14.859 --> 00:48:26.068]  I mean, I think over the next five to ten years, you might see some states, Alaska, Texas, various states, trying to break away from the United States and leave.
[00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:32.434]  I think it's more likely that the union we have now gets smaller and that we include other countries.
[00:48:33.601 --> 00:48:34.282]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:48:34.302 --> 00:48:38.225]  There's a lot of government reports saying that the United States may break up into pieces.
[00:48:38.245 --> 00:48:39.767]  Of course, the globalists will love that.
[00:48:39.787 --> 00:48:41.849]  They'll just snap up the pieces that are left.
[00:48:42.149 --> 00:48:45.172]  Kerry in Georgia, you're on the air with Peter Schiff of Europe Pacific Capital.
[00:48:48.495 --> 00:48:49.936]  Go ahead, Kerry, if you want to talk.
[00:48:50.517 --> 00:48:55.501]  I've worked for PrisonPlanet.tv for three years, and I just love your work.
[00:48:56.002 --> 00:48:57.283]  My question for Mr. Schiff,
[00:48:59.235 --> 00:49:08.664]  I've noticed that there's been a lot of foreclosed homes in my area and that they're now selling for a third of half of the value.
[00:49:10.166 --> 00:49:21.117]  I've been making an extra two and a half payments a year on my mortgage and I've gotten a lot of equity built up and I'm wondering what's happening to the equity that is built up in my home.
[00:49:22.222 --> 00:49:23.102]  Well, I don't know.
[00:49:23.222 --> 00:49:28.484]  I mean, whether the equity is there or not, I mean, just because you're paying down your mortgage doesn't necessarily mean you're building equity.
[00:49:28.524 --> 00:49:32.005]  I don't know what you pay for your house, and I don't know what you can sell it for.
[00:49:32.045 --> 00:49:37.746]  I mean, your house, you know, you could have negative equity in your home, despite the fact that you've been making all these extra payments.
[00:49:37.806 --> 00:49:41.047]  It all depends on what you pay for your home and how much you bought for it.
[00:49:41.067 --> 00:49:42.327]  You might have overpaid for it.
[00:49:42.347 --> 00:49:42.948]  I don't know.
[00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.731]  Let me give listeners a tip and then Peter continue.
[00:49:47.531 --> 00:49:54.875]  People are going to the bank and making them renegotiate the value of the home or they're threatening to walk away and banks are buckling.
[00:49:54.915 --> 00:49:55.155]  Peter?
[00:49:56.695 --> 00:50:02.918]  Yeah, look, you know, the borrower has all the cards, particularly the borrower with little or no equity in their homes.
[00:50:03.538 --> 00:50:06.820]  You know, you can simply go to your bank and say, look,
[00:50:07.378 --> 00:50:11.480]  If you want me to keep making the mortgage payment, you better renegotiate the mortgage.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.601]  The key is, in the past, you really couldn't do that.
[00:50:15.621 --> 00:50:24.124]  If they renegotiated the mortgage, the difference between what you used to owe and what you owe now would have been taxable income, and you would have had a big tax bill.
[00:50:24.404 --> 00:50:28.806]  But the government put a stop to that for five years or so.
[00:50:29.531 --> 00:50:35.793]  Americans have a window of opportunity where there's no downside to threatening your lender.
[00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:38.033]  Because, you know, you can get a lower mortgage.
[00:50:38.213 --> 00:50:40.354]  Worst case scenario, you just walk away.
[00:50:40.654 --> 00:50:43.115]  You know, just give the house to the lender, which is what they don't want.
[00:50:43.355 --> 00:50:45.715]  But you can give them an asset that has negative value.
[00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:48.496]  And there's plenty of houses on the market to rent.
[00:50:48.856 --> 00:50:51.317]  I mean, most people would be better off renting anyway.
[00:50:51.357 --> 00:50:58.219]  Chances are, you can find a home that's as nice or nicer than the one you live in now, where the rent is lower than your mortgage.
[00:50:58.539 --> 00:50:59.500]  All right, stay there, Peter.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.140]  Final segment.
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.141]  We're called straight ahead.
[00:51:03.142 --> 00:51:03.603]  Attention.

[00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:14.771]  Here is why.

[00:51:25.979 --> 00:51:28.361]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:30.802]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:51:30.822 --> 00:51:31.323]  this fall?
[00:51:31.803 --> 00:51:32.303]  Don't wait.

[00:52:01.607 --> 00:52:08.955]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:09.315 --> 00:52:10.977]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:11.929 --> 00:52:12.969]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.970]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:15.271]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:16.591]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:16.631 --> 00:52:18.252]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:18.632 --> 00:52:25.395]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:25.795 --> 00:52:26.235]  Some U.S.
[00:52:26.275 --> 00:52:31.918]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:32.618 --> 00:52:36.101]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:36.121 --> 00:52:38.283]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:03.124 --> 00:53:08.587]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:53:08.628 --> 00:53:09.148]  and the world.
[00:53:09.408 --> 00:53:12.870]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:19.514]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:53:19.794 --> 00:53:21.576]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:53:21.816 --> 00:53:27.039]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[00:53:27.239 --> 00:53:27.539]  I think so.

[00:54:26.135 --> 00:54:27.715]  Our guest is Peter Schiff.
[00:54:28.075 --> 00:54:34.897]  Before he leaves us in about five minutes, we'll put his website up on the screen for you, europec.net.
[00:54:35.937 --> 00:54:40.018]  Peter, I want to take one or two final calls for you, but just very briefly.
[00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:44.079]  Good case scenario, how bad is it going to get?
[00:54:44.399 --> 00:54:46.199]  Worst case scenario, how bad will it get?
[00:54:46.239 --> 00:54:46.899]  Just summed up.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.680]  Well, worst case scenario, it was really bad.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.981]  I mean, you know, hyperinflation, our money being worthless,
[00:54:54.868 --> 00:54:56.650]  Uh, you know, that's bad.
[00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:59.312]  I mean, you know, I mean, look what happened in, in, in Germany.
[00:54:59.672 --> 00:55:02.294]  Well, why about Republic Germany when they had hyperinflation?
[00:55:02.354 --> 00:55:03.475]  They ended up with Adolf Hitler.
[00:55:03.915 --> 00:55:13.543]  You know, I mean, I don't think it's gonna, I mean, I don't think it could be that bad, but it just shows you that, you know, bad things can happen when you, when you get a country that's in that bad a shape.
[00:55:13.583 --> 00:55:19.428]  I mean, the, the, the environment, the economic environment that allowed someone like a Hitler to come to power.
[00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:27.675]  He never could have come to power if they didn't have that economic situation.
[00:55:27.755 --> 00:55:33.018]  There's a lot of danger to our liberties, to our way of life, based on how bad these things could get.
[00:55:33.298 --> 00:55:34.319]  Best case scenario?
[00:55:34.599 --> 00:55:39.202]  Best case scenario would be the government comes to its senses at some point.
[00:55:39.242 --> 00:55:43.064]  They realize that the stimulus and bailouts are making the situation worse.
[00:55:43.445 --> 00:55:44.385]  We reverse course.
[00:55:44.685 --> 00:55:45.886]  We cut government spending.
[00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:47.187]  We increase interest rates.
[00:55:47.683 --> 00:55:49.164]  We let the chips fall where they may.
[00:55:49.664 --> 00:55:52.526]  We suck it up and we suffer a very severe economic downturn.
[00:55:53.547 --> 00:56:07.656]  We stop buying stuff and we roll up our sleeves and go back to work and rebuild a viable economy, recapture our role in the world and make a country that our children can be proud of and be prosperous in.
[00:56:09.137 --> 00:56:10.938]  It's not a complete lost cause yet.
[00:56:10.958 --> 00:56:17.022]  We can still hope, but there's no way to get from where we are now to where we want to be without going through a lot of pain.
[00:56:17.543 --> 00:56:23.286]  We can go through more pain if we do it the government's way, or we can go through less pain if we do it the free market way.
[00:56:23.687 --> 00:56:26.709]  And Obama says he's going the government way.
[00:56:27.909 --> 00:56:30.091]  Oh yeah, because that's the only way they think.
[00:56:30.571 --> 00:56:32.172]  See, Obama's out making speeches.
[00:56:32.212 --> 00:56:35.314]  He's saying that unless we act, it's going to get a lot worse.
[00:56:35.874 --> 00:56:38.215]  You know, it's going to get a lot worse whether we act or not.
[00:56:38.496 --> 00:56:42.098]  It's just that if we do act, it's going to get even worse than if we don't act.
[00:56:43.015 --> 00:56:44.396]  Well, we saw that back in October.
[00:56:44.436 --> 00:56:45.596]  They passed the Banker Takeover.
[00:56:45.616 --> 00:56:46.156]  Look what happened.
[00:56:46.816 --> 00:56:49.877]  Let's talk to Michael and Mass.
[00:56:49.897 --> 00:56:51.578]  You're on the air with our guest.
[00:56:51.618 --> 00:56:51.998]  Go ahead.
[00:56:53.819 --> 00:56:55.379]  Peter, Alex, how's it going today, guys?
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:55.700]  Good.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.640]  We've got about a minute and a half.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.881]  I want to say something real quick.
[00:57:00.301 --> 00:57:10.625]  In order for people to stop listening to the Davos folks, the Bilderberg Group folks, the people who set us up to fail and then try to act like our saviors, it seems to me that
[00:57:11.184 --> 00:57:21.392]  In order for people to turn away from them, those people have to come under a certain degree of ridicule and need to be kind of dethroned in the eyes of the public.
[00:57:22.113 --> 00:57:27.177]  I had an idea for Peter, and I know he's a big friend of Ron Paul.
[00:57:27.877 --> 00:57:36.604]  When Ron Paul's in front of the House Banking Committee with Bernanke, why doesn't he just say, hey Ben, what are you guys doing at the Bilderberg Group?
[00:57:37.051 --> 00:57:41.613]  Before anything else happens and you give away any more money.
[00:57:41.773 --> 00:57:45.595]  I videotaped him going in there setting policy last year.
[00:57:46.435 --> 00:57:52.758]  What about calling for criminal charges for the rules that have been broken, the laws that have been broken, all the insider trading, all the corruption, Peter?
[00:57:53.298 --> 00:57:58.080]  We should be talking about these people being in trouble instead of them posing as the saviors.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:58.300]  Peter?
[00:57:59.318 --> 00:58:14.971]  Yeah, look, I mean, we need to confront the Fed about a lot of things that they've done wrong, but unfortunately they've been given even greater power, and now the Federal Reserve works in conjunction with the Treasury, so instead of having an independent central bank, the central bank is totally captured by the politicians.
[00:58:15.472 --> 00:58:18.114]  They work, you know, hand-in-hand with the Treasury Department.
[00:58:18.642 --> 00:58:25.724]  And, you know, the whole idea behind the Fed was that it was going to be independent to keep the politicians in check.
[00:58:26.024 --> 00:58:31.746]  And now they're able to run amok because the Federal Reserve is basically, you know, going along with the ride.
[00:58:32.566 --> 00:58:35.307]  All right, Peter Schiff, we really appreciate you spending time with us.
[00:58:35.347 --> 00:58:35.767]  Take care.
[00:58:36.747 --> 00:58:37.087]  Sure thing.
[00:58:37.948 --> 00:58:38.688]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:38.768 --> 00:58:39.308]  Stay with us.
[00:58:43.909 --> 00:58:45.570]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:47.302 --> 00:58:49.463]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.363 --> 00:58:52.943]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:52.983 --> 00:58:53.944]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:54.064 --> 00:58:58.625]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:58.805 --> 00:59:01.545]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:01.765 --> 00:59:04.626]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:04.806 --> 00:59:09.527]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:09.747 --> 00:59:10.667]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:10.867 --> 00:59:13.809]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:14.129 --> 00:59:21.012]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:21.132 --> 00:59:24.253]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:24.393 --> 00:59:24.653]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:27.074 --> 00:59:29.336]  Or, on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:29.536 --> 00:59:35.600]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.382]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:39.403 --> 00:59:40.803]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:40.843 --> 00:59:41.504]  Take action today.
[00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:43.385]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:55.043 --> 00:59:56.944]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.444 --> 01:00:00.346]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:12.193]  We are now into the fourth and final hour of simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:12.453 --> 01:00:20.538]  We have Peter J. Wallison from American Enterprise Institute joining us to talk about his perspective on the Banker Takeover.
[01:00:23.885 --> 01:00:25.365]  Pardon me, my producer's telling me something.
[01:00:25.405 --> 01:00:26.286]  Come on in here and tell me.
[01:00:28.567 --> 01:00:29.587]  Yeah, he's coming up next segment.
[01:00:29.947 --> 01:00:30.187]  Great.
[01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:31.908]  Fantastic.
[01:00:33.848 --> 01:00:44.892]  But right now, for the next four minutes, let's go ahead and go to Ted Anderson with an update on what's happening in the gold and silver market, Midas Resources.
[01:00:46.158 --> 01:00:48.579]  Ted, 30 years in the gold and silver business.
[01:00:49.019 --> 01:00:50.199]  Again, he still has gold.
[01:00:50.219 --> 01:00:54.540]  He bought back when gold was $838.35, but it is almost all gone.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.561]  Well up, right up there at $910 an ounce.
[01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:02.842]  Today, and folks, don't wait until the economy implodes.
[01:01:02.882 --> 01:01:06.503]  Don't wait until everything completely falls apart and the paper money can't buy silver and gold.
[01:01:07.003 --> 01:01:14.405]  Move some of your assets today into gold and silver, and I can't find a better place or a better deal on physical holding of gold and silver.
[01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:16.931]  Ted, tell folks about today's offer.
[01:01:17.611 --> 01:01:18.532]  Yeah, I sure will.
[01:01:19.573 --> 01:01:26.937]  Well, what we have going on right now is I do have, like you said, I have some of those Franks and some of those Sovereigns left at that 830 level.
[01:01:27.978 --> 01:01:35.782]  Interestingly enough, we did have a little dip down there below 900, and I was able to pick up some Maple Leafs and Eagles and that kind of thing.
[01:01:36.483 --> 01:01:38.324]  There's a new coin that's coming out of the U.S.
[01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:40.965]  Mint that's a replica of the $20 St.
[01:01:41.005 --> 01:01:41.305]  Gaudens.
[01:01:41.345 --> 01:01:42.686]  It's a high-relief coin, beautiful.
[01:01:42.726 --> 01:01:43.947]  I'm hoping to get a bunch of those.
[01:01:44.797 --> 01:01:51.060]  But right now, at this particular time, I mean, you just watch it, it dips back, and boom, it just forwards back up again.
[01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:56.423]  And the phones are ringing, people want the gold right now, and I would suggest that everybody get in on it.
[01:01:57.164 --> 01:02:04.347]  There just isn't enough good news out there in the economy that would force gold to drop, you know, significantly down anymore.
[01:02:04.427 --> 01:02:05.148]  Everything is up.
[01:02:05.748 --> 01:02:12.892]  And so, yeah, right now, if you want to get on something, get in on something that is underpriced and at a good value at this time.
[01:02:13.356 --> 01:02:16.639]  Those francs, smaller gold pieces, they're a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[01:02:16.679 --> 01:02:18.280]  They're sitting at $217.
[01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:22.304]  And the British Sovereign is at $265.
[01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.307]  Going into the marketplace now, that gold is at $910.
[01:02:25.727 --> 01:02:27.108]  The same coins.
[01:02:27.188 --> 01:02:28.449]  The franc right now would be at $228.
[01:02:28.489 --> 01:02:29.830]  British Sovereign would be at $279.
[01:02:34.395 --> 01:02:34.916]  I don't
[01:02:52.592 --> 01:02:56.976]  You're doing this because you've got so many connections around the world that other people don't have.
[01:02:56.996 --> 01:02:59.037]  Folks, you're not going to find deals like this anywhere else.
[01:02:59.057 --> 01:02:59.558]  800-686-2237.
[01:02:59.578 --> 01:03:01.139]  800-686-2237.
[01:03:01.359 --> 01:03:11.307]  Yeah, all I can say about it, Alex, right now, is that there's times when I buy this stuff and the gold and silver bumps up.
[01:03:11.327 --> 01:03:16.291]  I mean, you can't even find this stuff at garage sale prices on eBay for what I'm selling it for.
[01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:20.714]  And the reason why that is is because every time I see a dip, I'm a buyer.
[01:03:21.286 --> 01:03:28.751]  And I just trust in the fact that the United States government is going to screw things up even worse and push the prices even higher.
[01:03:29.091 --> 01:03:30.892]  I'm not afraid to take on inventory.
[01:03:31.226 --> 01:03:36.887]  With that type of circumstance going on, I don't think the people that are listening to this show should be afraid of that either.
[01:03:37.247 --> 01:04:00.112]  Now is the time to be getting into gold and silver, when the horns and the sirens and the, you know, the air raid sirens are going off, and everything is just pointing at the fact that the United States dollar is in trouble, that the United States economy is even in worse trouble, and the politicians think that spending money and building golf courses and marinas and God knows what else.
[01:04:00.152 --> 01:04:00.612]  I mean, look.
[01:04:01.397 --> 01:04:06.640]  Let's just start paying for every woman that needs to have an abortion, or wants to have an abortion right now, I should say.
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.122]  You know, I mean, that's the kind of crap that they're trying to feed down our throat.
[01:04:10.362 --> 01:04:12.504]  They want to buy new cars for each senator.
[01:04:12.544 --> 01:04:13.304]  Green cars.
[01:04:13.664 --> 01:04:15.785]  Oh, they're going to make the whole capital green now.
[01:04:16.106 --> 01:04:16.886]  Oh my God.
[01:04:17.647 --> 01:04:20.048]  This is not going to solve our economic problems.
[01:04:20.387 --> 01:04:23.331]  You don't solve your economic problems by spending more money.
[01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:24.492]  That's not how you do it.
[01:04:25.013 --> 01:04:31.942]  You tighten your belt, and you do things where you're sacrificing, and you get through it.
[01:04:32.343 --> 01:04:33.705]  This is crazy.
[01:04:33.905 --> 01:04:34.466]  Absolutely.
[01:04:34.486 --> 01:04:35.867]  Let me fire out the number to folks.
[01:04:36.328 --> 01:04:36.548]  Absolutely.
[01:04:36.568 --> 01:04:37.389]  They'll be here waiting for your call.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.522]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:05:05.682 --> 01:05:10.925]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:05:11.185 --> 01:05:16.548]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:05:16.929 --> 01:05:18.029]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:27.295]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.336]  Now, compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:05:29.537 --> 01:05:33.720]  All-natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.383]  They're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:05:38.763 --> 01:05:40.865]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:43.366]  Keep it natural.
[01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:51.850]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:57.272]  Try Calbin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:05:57.312 --> 01:06:01.293]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:06:02.414 --> 01:06:08.816]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:09.176 --> 01:06:10.857]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:11.992 --> 01:06:12.853]  Who is the enemy?
[01:06:13.353 --> 01:06:13.853]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:14.154 --> 01:06:15.134]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:15.154 --> 01:06:16.495]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:16.515 --> 01:06:18.176]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:25.261]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:25.661 --> 01:06:26.101]  Some U.S.
[01:06:26.141 --> 01:06:31.825]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:32.485 --> 01:06:36.007]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:36.367 --> 01:06:46.231]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:46.471 --> 01:06:47.212]  Fabled enemies.
[01:06:47.692 --> 01:06:54.975]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:55.455 --> 01:06:58.797]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:10.620]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:21.413]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide and chloride toxins.
[01:07:21.653 --> 01:07:22.014]  I think so.
[01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.830]  Let's do it!
[01:08:04.156 --> 01:08:10.180]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:13.742]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.428 --> 01:08:19.311]  He was White House Counsel to Ronald Reagan.
[01:08:20.312 --> 01:08:31.403]  He's Peter J. Wollison, Coordinator at the American Enterprise Institute's Program on Financial Markets, deregulation, Wollison studies banking, insurance, and the Wall Street Regulation, as General Counsel to the U.S.
[01:08:31.443 --> 01:08:32.224]  Treasury Department.
[01:08:32.684 --> 01:08:36.048]  He had a significant role in the development of the Reagan Administration's proposals
[01:08:36.488 --> 01:08:38.770]  for the deregulation of the financial services industry.
[01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:46.476]  He was also General Counsel of the Depository Insurance Deregulation Committee and later served again as White House Counsel to President Ronald Reagan.
[01:08:46.496 --> 01:08:57.866]  His latest book is The Competitive Equality, A Better Way to Organize Mutual Funds, or Competitive Equity, excuse me.
[01:08:58.246 --> 01:09:02.650]  And so he joins us from the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research.
[01:09:04.793 --> 01:09:13.956]  What in the world, from your perspective, is going on right now, and which direction, in your opinion, is Washington going, and is that in the right direction?
[01:09:15.637 --> 01:09:18.578]  Well, it depends on the area we are talking about.
[01:09:18.598 --> 01:09:28.042]  I think the stimulus package looks like it is going in the right direction, because the Republicans are finally beginning to influence things in the Senate.
[01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:33.944]  They obviously lost out completely in the House, but it was nice to see that
[01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:39.490]  All the Republicans stuck together and voted against what came out of the House, which was simply a pork-barrel bill.
[01:09:40.230 --> 01:09:42.372]  The usual Democratic pork-barrel.
[01:09:42.693 --> 01:09:48.478]  And I think the latest polls indicate the American people have recognized it as such.
[01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:53.603]  So things are looking a little bit better on the stimulus side.
[01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:55.625]  I'd say from Obama's point of view,
[01:09:56.385 --> 01:10:05.389]  Things are really falling apart because what happened to him shouldn't happen to a person who had any kind of sophistication in Washington.
[01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:13.173]  And I don't know where his advisors were on this, but he allowed the House of Representatives to shape his stimulus bill.
[01:10:13.873 --> 01:10:18.355]  And he then had to go out and tell the American people things that weren't true.
[01:10:18.675 --> 01:10:22.537]  This is not good for the way to start your administration.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:30.026]  You shouldn't go out and lie to the American people about what one of your policies is going to do.
[01:10:30.186 --> 01:10:32.027]  They figure it out very quickly.
[01:10:32.848 --> 01:10:35.110]  So, now the Senate has gotten a hold of it.
[01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:37.912]  There is a lot of debate going on there.
[01:10:37.952 --> 01:10:42.355]  It looks like there will be some changes to make it much more tax-friendly.
[01:10:43.036 --> 01:10:45.358]  More Republican taxes going into it.
[01:10:46.198 --> 01:10:50.542]  Fewer pork barrel projects that came out of the House.
[01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:59.553]  Obama will take a big whipping on this one, and maybe he will have learned a lesson, but this is almost irretrievable.
[01:10:59.933 --> 01:11:05.096]  You know the old expression, and that is that you never have a second chance to make a first impression.
[01:11:05.911 --> 01:11:14.396]  And what the American people are seeing now in Obama is a completely different view than what they had seen during the campaign.
[01:11:14.776 --> 01:11:18.099]  Or you never get a fourth chance to make a third impression.
[01:11:18.119 --> 01:11:21.340]  I mean, I don't see this as his first big blowout.
[01:11:22.081 --> 01:11:32.647]  Almost all of his cabinet or sub-cabinet positions haven't paid their taxes entirely or partially and are having to resign in droves before they're ever even confirmed.
[01:11:32.687 --> 01:11:34.929]  I would call that the first big disaster.
[01:11:35.609 --> 01:11:50.773]  And then now, people are finding out millions of dollars in Austin, Texas, where I live, for frisbee golf, hundreds of millions for a river boardwalk, tens of millions for a golf course expansion, yacht clubs, Hollywood producer money.
[01:11:51.353 --> 01:11:53.613]  I mean, this is the worst pork barrel I've ever seen.
[01:11:54.153 --> 01:11:55.014]  Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[01:11:55.294 --> 01:11:55.894]  It's pretty bad.
[01:11:59.299 --> 01:12:19.066]  Look, for me, for other Republicans, it is kind of humorous to see this happen, but on the other hand, I mean, we only have one president, and I do get a little bit worried that he is losing control of the situation.
[01:12:19.186 --> 01:12:26.629]  If we were not in such bad economic straits right now, if things were not
[01:12:27.065 --> 01:12:27.705]  I don't think so.
[01:12:45.677 --> 01:13:04.047]  Well, he got where he is because he's a great actor and a great performer, and he did what he was told in the Senate, but now those instincts to say yes, yes, yes to everybody, those are the same instincts that made George Bush triple the size of government with the Democrats and destroyed his presidency, and it looks like Obama is looking to top that.
[01:13:04.267 --> 01:13:12.672]  Can you speak to that specifically, and then give us your political take on most of the people he's trying to get in the Cabinet and having to step down?
[01:13:13.876 --> 01:13:16.917]  Well, yeah, let me just talk about the spending.
[01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:26.581]  The spending is going to be terrible if Obama allows himself to be taken for a ride again by the Democrats in Congress.
[01:13:26.621 --> 01:13:27.961]  He's got to make a choice now.
[01:13:28.241 --> 01:13:38.705]  I mean, he has got to show the American people, who are quite concerned about spending, that he's got a handle on this thing and he's nobody's tool.
[01:13:39.392 --> 01:13:56.664]  What happened to him on the stimulus package is that Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats simply harnessed him to go out and tell the American people that what they had written up in this bill was a stimulus package, and that soon got old.
[01:13:56.684 --> 01:13:58.946]  I mean, people recognized that that was not true.
[01:13:59.546 --> 01:14:04.970]  So, he's going to be in very bad shape.
[01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:08.873]  What, however, is happening elsewhere
[01:14:09.651 --> 01:14:13.733]  in his administration is also troubling to him, as you suggest.
[01:14:13.873 --> 01:14:23.278]  I mean, it isn't actually all his appointees, or even a majority of appointees, but some very important ones didn't pay their taxes.
[01:14:24.279 --> 01:14:36.165]  Geithner, who was... Tim Geithner, who was the nominee for Secretary of the Treasury, got through, despite the fact that he had quite clearly ignored his tax obligations.
[01:14:36.792 --> 01:15:02.195]  That is a remarkable thing that could happen, because when I was at the Treasury Department, if there was the slightest hint that a person had not met his tax obligations before he applied to have a job of any kind, I don't care whether you're talking about clipping hedges or you're talking about an assistant secretary's job,
[01:15:03.259 --> 01:15:06.762]  If you hadn't observed your tax obligations, you were out.
[01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:09.224]  You never even got for an interview.
[01:15:10.225 --> 01:15:15.810]  And here we have the Secretary of the Treasury, who has set a very, very bad example.
[01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:18.532]  He's lost whatever moral authority he might have had.
[01:15:18.592 --> 01:15:23.016]  Well, going back to be specific, it's quite a few of the cabinet and sub-cabinet people that haven't made taxes.
[01:15:23.276 --> 01:15:26.759]  You're right, it's not all of them or the majority, but it's a large portion of the prominent ones.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.602]  I was kind of mixing in there other people having to step down, like
[01:15:31.423 --> 01:15:32.343]  Yeah, no, it's not good.
[01:15:32.423 --> 01:15:32.864]  It's not good.
[01:15:32.884 --> 01:15:34.244]  He's got to get control of this thing.
[01:15:56.815 --> 01:16:05.718]  And show the American people that he's actually trying to have an administration of the kind he talked about, and that he hasn't fooled them.
[01:16:05.838 --> 01:16:07.659]  This is what happened to Bill Clinton.
[01:16:08.719 --> 01:16:14.841]  And you remember that Clinton became exceedingly popular, unpopular, right after he became president.
[01:16:14.881 --> 01:16:15.642]  And why was that?
[01:16:16.262 --> 01:16:25.065]  And that is because, although he campaigned as a moderate, he campaigned as a Democrat who was more conservative than most, and a free trader and so forth,
[01:16:25.666 --> 01:16:30.429]  And the first thing he did when he came in was gaze in the military.
[01:16:31.329 --> 01:16:37.993]  And the American people turned to one another and they said, uh-oh, the Republicans were right, this guy's a liberal.
[01:16:39.354 --> 01:16:43.816]  And he no longer had any credibility with the American people.
[01:16:43.856 --> 01:16:46.678]  That's why so many of his other initiatives failed.
[01:16:48.279 --> 01:16:54.382]  And the real danger here for Obama is that he will be perceived the same way, in which case,
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:17:04.628]  We will have four years of lack of leadership, and this is not a time when we should be having a lack of leadership.
[01:17:04.648 --> 01:17:16.437]  All right, in the time we've got left with you, we're talking to the former White House chief counsel to President Reagan, also head counsel to the Treasury Department separately with the American Enterprise Institute, Peter J. Wollison.
[01:17:16.457 --> 01:17:24.063]  He's written quite a few books, the latest one, Competitive Equity, A Better Way to Organize Mutual Funds, put out by AEI Press.
[01:17:25.004 --> 01:17:26.605]  I also wrote a book about Reagan.
[01:17:26.885 --> 01:17:35.789]  It's on that list, but if your listeners are interested in that, they should be able to find that on Amazon.
[01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:36.690]  Absolutely.
[01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:43.573]  Now, specifically with the bailout, you've been criticizing the way some of it's being carried out.
[01:17:44.474 --> 01:17:44.674]  Yeah.
[01:17:45.574 --> 01:17:52.638]  Well, I am of the view that the only way we're going to be able to get the banks to start lending again
[01:17:53.428 --> 01:18:00.331]  Is if the banks have more confidence in their own capital, in their own assets.
[01:18:01.651 --> 01:18:08.053]  And right now they don't and they can't because their assets are largely mortgages.
[01:18:08.974 --> 01:18:19.597]  Mortgage-backed securities that were, that are bad quality and whole mortgages of various kinds.
[01:18:19.637 --> 01:18:20.938]  Now when that is true,
[01:18:21.736 --> 01:18:26.777]  And the housing market is continuing to fall, then these mortgages begin to default.
[01:18:27.637 --> 01:18:31.718]  And when they default, the banks have much less value there.
[01:18:32.318 --> 01:18:44.281]  As a result, they all are hoarding as much in the way of dollars as they can, so that if their depositors or their counterparties come in and ask for their money, the banks can pay them off.
[01:18:44.561 --> 01:18:48.862]  Otherwise, they're afraid they will be closed and default.
[01:18:49.443 --> 01:19:08.454]  So, the only way, I think, to get the banks to start lending is to buy those bad assets off their balance sheets and hold them in a bad bank or hold them in some other kind of account and substitute cash for those assets.
[01:19:08.534 --> 01:19:11.236]  In that case, the banks will be much healthier.
[01:19:11.636 --> 01:19:14.718]  They will look healthier to depositors and counterparties.
[01:19:15.205 --> 01:19:17.448]  They will feel comfortable beginning to lend money.
[01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:20.632]  But that's the solution to our problems on the one side.
[01:19:34.008 --> 01:19:35.008]  What's going on here?
[01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:37.549]  They talk about trillions of dollars, not $850 billion.
[01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:41.631]  And the Federal Reserve gets up before Congress and says, we're not going to say where it is.
[01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:50.094]  Because the banks are being completely secretive, because they're in such serious financial disarray.
[01:19:50.914 --> 01:19:56.817]  So we'll get your expert opinion, former Chief Counsel to the Treasury and to Ronald Reagan, when we come back on the other side.
[01:19:56.877 --> 01:19:57.297]  Stay with us.
[01:20:03.479 --> 01:20:04.589]  Hi, this is Steve Sheng.
[01:20:09.517 --> 01:20:19.624]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:20:20.144 --> 01:20:27.789]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:34.754]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[01:20:35.254 --> 01:20:36.615]  Food is an everyday need.
[01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.830]  On September 11, 2001, along with
[01:21:05.922 --> 01:21:08.205]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:21:08.445 --> 01:21:09.746]  And we knew what to do.
[01:21:09.766 --> 01:21:11.548]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:21:11.769 --> 01:21:18.196]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:21:18.796 --> 01:21:27.326]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:21:27.694 --> 01:21:34.497]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:21:34.797 --> 01:21:37.858]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:21:37.978 --> 01:21:43.180]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.381]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:22:00.098 --> 01:22:06.879]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:22:06.899 --> 01:22:08.159]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.880]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.701]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:16.841]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:17.161 --> 01:22:19.322]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:20.522 --> 01:22:30.968]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:32.649 --> 01:22:34.950]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:38.112]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[01:24:09.512 --> 01:24:12.334]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:14.076 --> 01:24:15.337]  Peter J. Wallace is our guest.
[01:24:15.357 --> 01:24:18.139]  We've got about five minutes left with him and I'm going to get into a bunch of news.
[01:24:18.499 --> 01:24:22.262]  Your phone calls and a lot more in the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:29.736]  Mr. Wollison, you're saying buy the assets to get the banks going again.
[01:24:30.277 --> 01:24:35.280]  Instead they just give them money and then we're told no one can know where it's going or what they're doing with it.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:42.524]  Then Obama makes a thing about executive compensation and criticizes the bailout as if he wasn't the guy that helped ram it through.
[01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.185]  So what's really happening right now?
[01:24:44.781 --> 01:24:51.883]  Well, I think the Obama administration is following exactly the wrong policy in trying to limit compensation.
[01:24:51.923 --> 01:24:53.244]  I understand why they're doing it.
[01:24:53.324 --> 01:25:04.787]  Yes, people are angry because these people are paid so much, but if you want the banks to be able to function, you cannot punish the people who are now in charge of them.
[01:25:04.807 --> 01:25:09.228]  The people who are now in charge of them are not the people who caused them all this trouble.
[01:25:10.168 --> 01:25:11.749]  They're not the people who lost all this money.
[01:25:12.504 --> 01:25:30.517]  They're new people who have come along to try to help out, and if you're going to cut their salaries when they're working 20 hours a day and having to leave their families for long periods of time, it's not going to attract many good people to those institutions, and we need good people there now.
[01:25:30.537 --> 01:25:32.779]  Well, sir, I'm not trying to be partisan, because I'm not.
[01:25:32.819 --> 01:25:34.120]  I'm a libertarian Ron Paul guy.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.581]  My issue here is that
[01:25:38.223 --> 01:25:39.564]  And you can blame Bush a lot for this.
[01:25:39.604 --> 01:25:40.464]  It goes all the way back.
[01:25:40.564 --> 01:25:46.667]  But more than that, it really was the Clintons who changed a lot of these rules and who allowed a lot of this stuff to happen.
[01:25:46.707 --> 01:25:50.769]  And then they run around, you know, then pointing their finger.
[01:25:51.009 --> 01:25:53.170]  But that's a side issue.
[01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:56.091]  While we have you here, you were White House Counselor Ronald Reagan.
[01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:59.413]  So I know you saw a lot of what went across his desk and what happened.
[01:25:59.833 --> 01:26:03.135]  And I have congressional testimony about Rex 84 and things like that.
[01:26:03.775 --> 01:26:05.936]  That's all been mainly secret.
[01:26:06.276 --> 01:26:14.518]  Now they're openly announcing things like this with bills for FEMA camps, to relocate Americans during collapse of society, continuity of government.
[01:26:14.558 --> 01:26:19.659]  It appears the federal government thinks we're going to go into a depression and is gearing up for collapse.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.460]  Well, I don't know anything about any of those things.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:26.581]  Maybe they are happening, but I haven't seen anything like that.
[01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:31.994]  And it is actually, though, possible that we could have a depression.
[01:26:32.674 --> 01:26:45.764]  That's why the government is acting in such extraordinary ways, why the Federal Reserve is doing so much, why the Treasury Department is spending so much, trying to avoid the possibility of a recession.
[01:26:45.824 --> 01:26:54.570]  Because in the 30s, the diagnosis has been that the reason we had this depression in the 30s was that the Federal Reserve did not act.
[01:26:55.191 --> 01:27:03.255]  And the government did not act satisfactorily to keep the economy from declining and keep deflation from occurring.
[01:27:03.755 --> 01:27:18.222]  So I think what they're doing is necessary, and I'm a conservative, but I don't understand why the Obama administration, when it has a chance to get things started again on a clean slate,
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.725]  Uh, would start now by punishing people on Wall Street who were not responsible for the losses.
[01:27:26.126 --> 01:27:31.810]  Well, Mr. Wallace, in closing, you've certainly heard about how they're putting combat brigades inside the U.S.
[01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:32.911]  I mean, that's all over the news.
[01:27:33.211 --> 01:27:33.952]  You haven't heard about that?
[01:27:34.492 --> 01:27:34.632]  No.
[01:27:36.154 --> 01:27:37.535]  Uh, have you heard about, uh,
[01:27:39.745 --> 01:27:41.125]  That doesn't mean it's not happening.
[01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:50.288]  It's just that I'm not reading it in the newspapers that I read and I'm not reading about it in the newspapers or I'm not hearing about it on the radio or seeing it on television.
[01:27:50.328 --> 01:27:54.949]  Did you see Market Watch last week when they called for a North American Union to get us out of this crisis?
[01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.829]  No.
[01:27:56.210 --> 01:27:57.470]  That Wall Street Journal online?
[01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:59.291]  No, I didn't see that.
[01:27:59.371 --> 01:28:01.032]  Well, I mean, there's millions of things I want to say.
[01:28:01.112 --> 01:28:02.193]  Oh, how dare you not know about it?
[01:28:02.253 --> 01:28:03.594]  I mean, some of this stuff's obscure.
[01:28:04.094 --> 01:28:11.900]  My whole point is that the big government folks seem to like crises because then they get to play savior and expand their power.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.601]  I mean, is there some of that going on with Obama?
[01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:14.682]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:14.842 --> 01:28:20.406]  I think it is true that for people who are in the government, this is a great opportunity.
[01:28:20.646 --> 01:28:21.867]  You heard Rahm Emanuel say
[01:28:22.668 --> 01:28:25.029]  It'd be a terrible thing to waste a good crisis.
[01:28:25.369 --> 01:28:33.891]  And what they mean by that is they can, especially the Democrats, can take over a much broader part of the economy through regulation and otherwise when there's a crisis.
[01:28:35.132 --> 01:28:39.833]  I and many others in Washington are trying very hard to make sure that that doesn't happen.
[01:28:41.073 --> 01:28:50.656]  But it's going to be a very tough, very tough fight because there are people who for a long time have wanted to impose much more regulation and many more controls.
[01:28:51.289 --> 01:29:01.412]  And this crisis gives them an opportunity to do it because the American people sometimes believe that that's what has to be done in a case like this.
[01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:07.774]  But we will get out of this situation in a few years.
[01:29:08.454 --> 01:29:13.175]  But if we impose new regulation, that will be with us for 50 years.
[01:29:13.695 --> 01:29:17.776]  And that will slow down the growth of our economy and make us a much different society.
[01:29:17.856 --> 01:29:19.777]  So I'm quite worried about that.
[01:29:20.433 --> 01:29:23.034]  Alright, Peter Wallison, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:23.375 --> 01:29:28.317]  Folks can find out more about you at www.aei.org.
[01:29:28.397 --> 01:29:30.979]  Do you have a personal website or can folks go check out your page on it?
[01:29:31.239 --> 01:29:31.639]  That's it.
[01:29:31.819 --> 01:29:32.879]  I don't have a personal website.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.440]  Alright, thank you for the time.
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:34.981]  Appreciate it.
[01:29:35.361 --> 01:29:35.961]  Sure, thank you.
[01:29:36.201 --> 01:29:36.441]  Bye-bye.
[01:29:36.721 --> 01:29:37.182]  Take care.
[01:29:38.254 --> 01:29:41.476]  Another big wig on the show for you to try to pick their brain?
[01:29:42.116 --> 01:29:44.937]  There he tells you they're using the crises to bring in more government.
[01:29:45.818 --> 01:29:50.841]  Alright, jam-packed information straight ahead on the one, the only, GCN.
[01:29:52.601 --> 01:29:55.603]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.523 --> 01:29:59.225]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.805 --> 01:30:06.188]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:30:06.328 --> 01:30:11.553]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:30:11.733 --> 01:30:16.517]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:28.008]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:30:28.408 --> 01:30:33.949]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:34.169 --> 01:30:40.231]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:40.431 --> 01:30:41.091]  What about you?
[01:30:41.471 --> 01:30:47.513]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:30:47.913 --> 01:30:50.033]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[01:30:53.394 --> 01:30:54.735]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[01:31:02.301 --> 01:31:05.443]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:08.645]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:09.006 --> 01:31:10.667]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:11.641 --> 01:31:12.662]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:13.182 --> 01:31:13.683]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:13.983 --> 01:31:14.964]  This is his M.O.
[01:31:14.984 --> 01:31:16.285]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:16.345 --> 01:31:18.007]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:18.347 --> 01:31:25.093]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:25.493 --> 01:31:25.934]  Some U.S.
[01:31:25.974 --> 01:31:31.619]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:32.319 --> 01:31:35.801]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:38.623]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:02.099 --> 01:32:10.505]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:32:10.805 --> 01:32:16.488]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:32:16.809 --> 01:32:23.333]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:32:23.894 --> 01:32:27.155]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:32:27.295 --> 01:32:29.536]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:32:29.736 --> 01:32:36.098]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:32:36.338 --> 01:32:39.659]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[01:32:39.859 --> 01:32:43.720]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[01:32:46.901 --> 01:32:49.862]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[01:32:50.062 --> 01:32:52.143]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[01:32:52.263 --> 01:32:55.644]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[01:32:55.924 --> 01:32:57.024]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[01:33:12.415 --> 01:33:15.636]  All right, I'm going to take calls and cover news for the balance of the transmission.
[01:33:15.656 --> 01:33:19.917]  First, I want to thank our sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[01:33:20.017 --> 01:33:21.298]  One of them is Survival of Seeds.
[01:33:21.658 --> 01:33:23.198]  Survivalofseeds.com.
[01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:25.219]  Knowing that something's coming is not the solution.
[01:33:25.259 --> 01:33:26.859]  Preparing for what's coming is the answer.
[01:33:27.159 --> 01:33:29.120]  Get seven years of healthy food for pennies a pound.
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:30.060]  100% heirloom seeds, non-GMO.
[01:33:33.334 --> 01:33:34.015]  Non-hybrid.
[01:33:34.355 --> 01:33:38.218]  Grow your own food and eliminate your dependence on the establishment, on society.
[01:33:38.759 --> 01:33:44.263]  Get 15,000 heirloom vegetable seeds for a great price for a seven-year family supply.
[01:33:44.283 --> 01:33:48.027]  Get seeds five times cheaper than the GM trash sold at Walmart.
[01:33:48.667 --> 01:33:50.848]  Same day, priority shipping, UPS available.
[01:33:51.328 --> 01:33:55.790]  But a long-term food solution, you will starve if everything collapses or become a slave.
[01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:57.910]  I believe everybody should be independent, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:58.431 --> 01:33:59.351]  Give them a call.
[01:33:59.891 --> 01:34:05.533]  You need the insurance of having thousands of pounds of healthy food because the store shelves could end up being empty.
[01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:07.714]  And regardless, it's just fun to garden.
[01:34:07.754 --> 01:34:07.994]  So, 620-637-2978.
[01:34:08.014 --> 01:34:08.054]  620-637-2978.
[01:34:17.372 --> 01:34:26.998]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is the website, and along the same line of being prepared, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:34:27.018 --> 01:34:28.699]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:34:28.979 --> 01:34:33.562]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms, listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[01:34:33.602 --> 01:34:38.104]  A solar power generator is now available from a long-time sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:34:38.424 --> 01:34:39.345]  It's designed to provide 1800 watts
[01:34:41.686 --> 01:34:52.788]  1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage, get an emergency power backup kit which consists of a power 1800 converter, power plant and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:34:53.508 --> 01:34:59.089]  Remember too that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:34:59.429 --> 01:35:02.730]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[01:35:02.970 --> 01:35:04.870]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:35:04.890 --> 01:35:07.931]  The government doesn't own the sun yet folks, so make your move today.
[01:35:08.351 --> 01:35:10.633]  Their website is MySolarBackup.com.
[01:35:10.653 --> 01:35:12.094]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:35:12.294 --> 01:35:15.436]  Or you can always call them toll free at 877-327-0365.
[01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:19.379]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.122]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:35:22.602 --> 01:35:23.042]  All right.
[01:35:23.102 --> 01:35:26.385]  Now, let's go ahead and rampage through your calls.
[01:35:26.645 --> 01:35:27.806]  Sean in Florida.
[01:35:27.846 --> 01:35:28.546]  You're on the air.
[01:35:28.606 --> 01:35:28.967]  Welcome.
[01:35:28.987 --> 01:35:30.888]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:35:31.128 --> 01:35:31.749]  Doing pretty good.
[01:35:31.789 --> 01:35:32.429]  What's on your mind?
[01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:36.993]  I just had a couple of unqualified, thought-provoking ideas.
[01:35:38.978 --> 01:35:42.820]  The first one is, you know, we're talking about the worst case scenario.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:55.303]  Coins, by their very nature, have a fundamental metal value, although it's not, you know, the face value of the coin, but if we were to... It's because of scarcity.
[01:35:55.323 --> 01:35:59.885]  It can be above or below the face value of the coin, or depending on, you know, when you get into the market.
[01:36:00.779 --> 01:36:09.524]  But as our currency devaluates, it might not be unwise to add more coinage into the currency, even though it is inconvenient and more cumbersome than paper.
[01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:12.725]  Because that metal will have an inherent value.
[01:36:12.745 --> 01:36:16.247]  No, that's the whole point about what type of monetary system we should have, sure.
[01:36:17.928 --> 01:36:29.294]  But, you know, another thing that I've thought recently is, as Ron Paul has always advocated, introducing a competing currency with a Federal Reserve note.
[01:36:29.735 --> 01:36:29.915]  Yes.
[01:36:30.848 --> 01:36:38.891]  You know, there's certainly some interesting court cases where, you know, the Supreme Court upheld the 16th Amendment didn't create a new tax.
[01:36:41.532 --> 01:36:54.016]  And the Congress, you know, like Title 12, Chapter 3, Subchapter 12, Section 411, essentially says Federal Reserve notes can be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department.
[01:36:54.076 --> 01:36:54.896]  But they don't do that.
[01:36:56.457 --> 01:36:56.917]  Exactly.
[01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:58.378]  So, you know, a question I had is,
[01:37:00.495 --> 01:37:04.202]  You know, we said that the Federal Reserve is a private credit.
[01:37:05.223 --> 01:37:13.939]  And, you know, we have this whole system of taxation and everything based on the fact that we use this private credit currency voluntarily.
[01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:20.514]  But it really is involuntarily, because they forced it to be not just the U.S.
[01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:21.934]  currency, but the world currency.
[01:37:22.375 --> 01:37:26.357]  And the establishment has been debasing the value of that as a form of theft.
[01:37:26.397 --> 01:37:29.500]  But back when it still had its value, they bought up real assets with it.
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:33.522]  And then we end up paying taxes to back up the value of that currency.
[01:37:33.562 --> 01:37:35.764]  So it really isn't a private, voluntary currency.
[01:37:36.084 --> 01:37:37.185]  It's a private currency.
[01:37:37.645 --> 01:37:38.686]  The profit is private.
[01:37:38.926 --> 01:37:40.387]  The cost is put onto the public.
[01:37:40.407 --> 01:37:41.528]  I appreciate your call, Sean.
[01:37:41.888 --> 01:37:43.409]  Steve in Vegas, you're on the air.
[01:37:46.576 --> 01:37:48.618]  Stephen, Las Vegas, Nevada, you're on the air.
[01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:51.080]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:52.241]  Welcome, Stephen.
[01:37:53.101 --> 01:37:55.583]  I originally got on, I was hoping to speak to Peter.
[01:37:56.484 --> 01:37:58.966]  I worked for his dad for five years.
[01:37:59.226 --> 01:38:08.493]  His father is in prison, Peter Schiff, for educating people on how to expose the private IRS or the collection agency for the private Federal Reserve.
[01:38:09.854 --> 01:38:12.817]  But he's in prison for that, but then all these politicians, they don't have to pay taxes.
[01:38:14.321 --> 01:38:14.501]  Right.
[01:38:14.541 --> 01:38:15.561]  He wrote a book.
[01:38:16.102 --> 01:38:19.083]  And I guess writing a book can be construed as illegal.
[01:38:19.243 --> 01:38:20.483]  I remember that a few years ago.
[01:38:20.523 --> 01:38:25.184]  Just for those that don't know, let me just tell them that you can talk.
[01:38:25.725 --> 01:38:25.965]  Okay.
[01:38:26.205 --> 01:38:29.146]  The judge ruled that he's not allowed to sell that book.
[01:38:29.226 --> 01:38:30.666]  So yeah, burning books basically.
[01:38:30.686 --> 01:38:30.986]  Go ahead.
[01:38:32.227 --> 01:38:32.487]  Right.
[01:38:33.707 --> 01:38:37.088]  He wrote the book and now he's got to do jail time.
[01:38:37.108 --> 01:38:40.189]  You'd ask, you know, how come we aren't getting any prosecutions?
[01:38:40.269 --> 01:38:42.790]  I would submit to you that that's one of the reasons that
[01:38:43.416 --> 01:38:58.369]  Federal employees, our public servants, are so busy prosecuting people for writing illegal books that they don't have time to prosecute any politicians or any Wall Street criminals or anybody like that.
[01:38:58.469 --> 01:39:04.515]  Well yeah, I mean the government exists now as a rogue institution to protect the criminals that run the government.
[01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:26.899]  The last guest that you had on, I hope maybe you can get the silver and gold guy to send him a copy of Jekyll Island, because I had a, you know, I wondered when I heard him say that buy the bad loans, I wrote it down, from the banks so that they'll be comfortable loaning.
[01:39:27.574 --> 01:39:31.175]  Well, they crave money out of bookkeeping entries.
[01:39:31.415 --> 01:39:33.395]  I mean, why would they be uncomfortable?
[01:39:33.455 --> 01:39:33.895]  Look, look, look.
[01:39:34.235 --> 01:39:36.096]  That last guy is pure establishment.
[01:39:36.596 --> 01:39:39.376]  We had him on to see if he'd, you know, slip up and say something about it.
[01:39:39.396 --> 01:39:39.976]  Alex, we need him.
[01:39:40.557 --> 01:39:41.137]  We need him.
[01:39:41.197 --> 01:39:44.797]  He's got the ear of many people in Washington, D.C.
[01:39:44.857 --> 01:39:50.579]  If we could get him listed in the InfoWars for a week, he'd be brought up to speed immediately.
[01:39:50.599 --> 01:39:53.999]  That guy was the Chief Counsel to the President, believe me.
[01:39:54.019 --> 01:39:56.400]  That little comment about how he didn't know about Rex 84, give me a break.
[01:39:58.319 --> 01:39:59.000]  I didn't see that.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.702]  I've met Peter before and I emailed Aaron.
[01:40:09.045 --> 01:40:16.929]  Maybe the next time you get him on, I'd like to... There's a lot of people that are wondering how Irwin's doing in incarceration and what we have to do to get him out of jail.
[01:40:17.169 --> 01:40:18.150]  I hear you and I appreciate his call.
[01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:19.470]  I'm going to let you go sometime and go to others.
[01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:23.393]  I almost brought it up to him, but I got busy during the breaks taking care of stuff.
[01:40:23.413 --> 01:40:28.175]  I wanted to ask if it was alright with him to talk about his dad being in prison, because I never hear him talking about that.
[01:40:28.515 --> 01:40:30.276]  We interviewed Irwin Schiffer many times.
[01:40:30.296 --> 01:40:31.617]  He's got a show on the Genesis Network.
[01:40:33.737 --> 01:40:37.000]  Ten years ago, for about a year and a half, I mean, everyone had a nightly show here.
[01:40:37.501 --> 01:40:38.182]  Everyone's chef.
[01:40:38.442 --> 01:40:41.766]  So, they did send him to prison for writing a book.
[01:40:41.806 --> 01:40:45.449]  They said, don't print any more of those books about the Federal Reserve being a scam.
[01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:54.038]  And that's, you heard his son, and next time he's on, I'll bring this up, but I don't want to, you know, run folks off, because I like Peter.
[01:40:55.021 --> 01:41:01.003]  And, you know, he's a golden boy of the mainstream media, so, because of Ron Paul promoting him, so, you know, we'll have him on.
[01:41:02.003 --> 01:41:07.384]  But that little comment at the end about, well, yeah, now the government's taken over the Federal Reserve, and that's the problem.
[01:41:07.404 --> 01:41:08.304]  It was supposed to be independent.
[01:41:08.885 --> 01:41:09.725]  It is the government.
[01:41:09.765 --> 01:41:13.106]  Private corporations act as governmental powers throughout history.
[01:41:13.126 --> 01:41:14.446]  You know, they're as big as governments.
[01:41:15.126 --> 01:41:18.007]  And it's controlling our government, not the other way around.
[01:41:18.107 --> 01:41:23.008]  Now the government is just massing more powers and handing it over to the Federal Reserve through the Banker Bailout Bill.
[01:41:23.528 --> 01:41:39.811]  But Erwin was, Erwin's son, Peter Schiff, was talking about, that's one thing I've heard him say that I don't agree with, it was at the end of the interview so I couldn't follow it to its conclusion or flesh it out with him, because the Federal Reserve is the source of all the problems.
[01:41:41.909 --> 01:41:42.950]  Here's a smart guy, though.
[01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:44.031]  He knows all about this stuff.
[01:41:44.071 --> 01:41:51.656]  He knows that by not going into those areas, he can still get on the media and talk about the basic facts against the bailout and the rest of it, so we appreciate him coming on.
[01:41:52.497 --> 01:41:54.939]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ryan in Illinois.
[01:41:55.019 --> 01:41:55.799]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[01:41:55.819 --> 01:41:56.540]  Hi.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:03.265]  I was just calling to talk about how everybody's trying to get the whole Obama situation all messed up.
[01:42:03.365 --> 01:42:06.848]  They think that he's the next pretty much
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:11.503]  I wouldn't like to say Jesus, but that's what a lot of people think.
[01:42:11.523 --> 01:42:11.983]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:42:12.003 --> 01:42:14.264]  There are a lot of churches saying he is the Messiah.
[01:42:14.284 --> 01:42:16.726]  President of the world, Savior of the world.
[01:42:17.306 --> 01:42:29.254]  Yeah, but most of the culture that I'm in, I'm an artist myself, a lot of the culture basically accepted him for whatever it seems and nobody's really paying attention to any of the policies or anything that's going on.
[01:42:29.974 --> 01:42:35.298]  It's craziness because the first thing that he should have done when he came into office would have been
[01:42:35.919 --> 01:42:39.222]  You know, go after the Federal Reserve like you just said a minute ago, not even.
[01:42:39.862 --> 01:42:45.587]  You know, that would have been key because that obviously is, you know, everything that's the base of your currency right now.
[01:42:46.128 --> 01:42:57.818]  Why wouldn't you have the ability to just say, you know, he's trying to like play off things like how, I don't know if you read this, he was trying to take away all like the gifting to all like the politicians and the head people.
[01:42:58.278 --> 01:42:59.039]  It makes no sense.
[01:42:59.099 --> 01:42:59.980]  It's just a way to just
[01:43:01.192 --> 01:43:07.176]  No, he'll do one thing and then do all this other window dressing.
[01:43:07.236 --> 01:43:09.017]  I'm closing Guantanamo, but he really isn't.
[01:43:09.037 --> 01:43:12.279]  He's just setting up more camps and continuing the secret arrest.
[01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:15.381]  I'm real mad about these banks getting all this compensation.
[01:43:16.541 --> 01:43:20.023]  But meanwhile, people running him are the architects of all this.
[01:43:20.043 --> 01:43:21.004]  This is by design.
[01:43:21.424 --> 01:43:27.367]  They did everything they could, all these administrations, to de-industrialize the country, get us totally in debt, and pull the rug out from under us.
[01:43:27.427 --> 01:43:28.228]  It's all staged.
[01:43:28.748 --> 01:43:38.513]  And the ruling elite need the media, the military, this whole system, to make sure they're able to carry out this final phase of bondage, of enslavement of the population.
[01:43:39.654 --> 01:43:40.655]  That's it and that's that.
[01:43:41.896 --> 01:43:42.916]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:43:42.936 --> 01:43:43.557]  Good to hear from you.
[01:43:43.577 --> 01:43:44.437]  We're moving along here.
[01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:46.459]  Michael in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:43:46.479 --> 01:43:52.523]  Alex, I just wanted to comment on your last caller.
[01:43:53.243 --> 01:43:55.044]  I'm an economics writer myself.
[01:43:56.425 --> 01:44:01.209]  The problem he had with buying the bad assets from the banks and the
[01:44:02.023 --> 01:44:06.826]  Setting up the bad bank, and this is like the Republicans' new answer to everything Obama's doing.
[01:44:07.246 --> 01:44:10.008]  The problem with that is it leaves us in the same mess we're in now.
[01:44:10.688 --> 01:44:12.069]  It doesn't get us out of the mess.
[01:44:12.529 --> 01:44:15.471]  All it does is it creates the new bubble.
[01:44:15.571 --> 01:44:17.752]  We'll never get out of this mess.
[01:44:17.812 --> 01:44:19.633]  Yeah, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:24.436]  And all the things they're doing expand the power of the criminal bankers that engineered all of this.
[01:44:25.497 --> 01:44:26.197]  Absolutely.
[01:44:26.337 --> 01:44:27.798]  And they're reading Control Freak.
[01:44:28.905 --> 01:44:29.205]  Go ahead.
[01:44:29.245 --> 01:44:47.178]  Well, until Fractional Reserve Banking, which is nothing but theft, until Fractional Reserve Banking is stopped, we're going to continue having these booms and busts, and until the Federal Reserve goes down, we will continue having the business cycle and having these problems, and it's never going to end.
[01:44:48.379 --> 01:44:51.021]  I hear you, and I agree with you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:44:51.281 --> 01:44:53.142]  Maggie in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:44:54.884 --> 01:44:57.345]  Yes, Alex, you've been talking about
[01:44:58.859 --> 01:45:13.613]  Advertising propaganda and I just wanted to call to your attention what I consider the most diabolically evil advertising campaign I've ever seen and that is the recent vaccines are like hugs.
[01:45:14.284 --> 01:45:15.164]  Gardasil.
[01:45:15.405 --> 01:45:26.950]  It's like a hug to take the experimental live cancer virus shot that on the insert they admit causes all sorts of autoimmune diseases and death in some cases, and which doesn't even protect you from genital warts.
[01:45:27.011 --> 01:45:29.772]  But aww, it's a huggy-wug.
[01:45:30.092 --> 01:45:30.852]  Let's pull that up.
[01:45:30.933 --> 01:45:32.233]  Gardasil hug ad.
[01:45:32.733 --> 01:45:34.034]  Gardasil... I'm not even talking.
[01:45:34.194 --> 01:45:35.715]  Yeah, okay, go ahead.
[01:45:35.755 --> 01:45:39.337]  I've seen another Gardasil where it's loving and then she's hugging her daughter.
[01:45:39.537 --> 01:45:41.398]  You're saying there's one where they actually say it's like a hug?
[01:45:41.949 --> 01:45:44.891]  No, yes, but this is this is a different one.
[01:45:44.931 --> 01:45:45.932]  This is a billboard.
[01:45:45.952 --> 01:45:48.594]  It shows an adorable baby.
[01:45:48.614 --> 01:45:52.397]  And it says vaccines are like hugs.
[01:45:52.457 --> 01:45:54.358]  You've seen it.
[01:45:54.418 --> 01:45:59.702]  Okay, I've got a picture of it that I took with contrails in the background.
[01:45:59.802 --> 01:46:01.183]  And you used to have a place
[01:46:01.881 --> 01:46:06.144]  for graphics like this do you still because I'd like to send that if you could use it.
[01:46:06.424 --> 01:46:08.505]  Do I still have it?
[01:46:08.905 --> 01:46:17.550]  There used to be, before your Infowars webpage changed a lot, there used to be a spot for people to contribute graphics.
[01:46:17.670 --> 01:46:26.155]  The best place for you is to go post that stuff in the PrisonPlanet.com forum and then tens of thousands every day are in there and will look at it.
[01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:30.064]  Do I have to be a member of that forum?
[01:46:30.104 --> 01:46:31.086]  I don't exactly know.
[01:46:31.326 --> 01:46:32.027]  Nope, it's free.
[01:46:32.648 --> 01:46:33.229]  How do you do it?
[01:46:33.930 --> 01:46:35.692]  Or could I contact Watson about it?
[01:46:35.752 --> 01:46:37.474]  Or just figure this out myself?
[01:46:38.490 --> 01:46:42.172]  Yeah, I mean, I've seen the billboard, now that you talk about it.
[01:46:42.192 --> 01:46:45.533]  There's a little baby laying there and it says, vaccines are like hugs.
[01:46:47.494 --> 01:46:50.916]  But I mean, you say you know how to email something, so it's the same deal.
[01:46:50.936 --> 01:46:57.459]  You just go to PrisonPlanetForum, or is it ForumPrisonPlanet.com, and then you just create a username.
[01:46:57.519 --> 01:46:59.000]  It could be anything you want.
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:06.423]  It could be George Washington 97, and then you... I think I did that a long time ago and never used it again, so I've forgotten it.
[01:47:06.463 --> 01:47:07.564]  Will that give me a problem?
[01:47:08.041 --> 01:47:09.402]  No, you can just create whatever you want.
[01:47:09.422 --> 01:47:13.304]  You can put in fake email addresses, whatever you want to make things up.
[01:47:13.885 --> 01:47:14.565]  I will try it.
[01:47:14.645 --> 01:47:18.667]  Okay, this has chemtrails in the background.
[01:47:18.728 --> 01:47:19.988]  Nutrition trails.
[01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:22.350]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:24.091]  Nutrition trails in the background.
[01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:26.532]  And if you don't like the chemtrails, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:47:27.213 --> 01:47:27.913]  Thank you, Maggie.
[01:47:27.993 --> 01:47:30.114]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:47:31.015 --> 01:47:32.416]  Nutrition trails, I like that.
[01:47:32.476 --> 01:47:32.936]  That's good.
[01:47:32.996 --> 01:47:34.857]  How are you doing today?
[01:47:35.238 --> 01:47:35.658]  Good, sir.
[01:47:36.428 --> 01:47:37.048]  Good, good.
[01:47:37.308 --> 01:47:48.192]  Hey, I just want to pass along a possible word to you as a way to maybe kind of expand, network out what you're doing to get the word out, and God bless you for it.
[01:47:48.212 --> 01:47:49.433]  I've been aware of you for
[01:47:50.143 --> 01:47:51.563]  I don't know, 10-12 years now.
[01:47:52.324 --> 01:48:10.829]  And there's a gentleman who has these billboards he posts all the time, you may have heard of him, Bill Balsamico, Casa de Ice, although I don't think from the billboards that he puts up in front of his restaurant that he's quite as in-depth and understanding maybe as you and I might be as to what's going on in our country today.
[01:48:11.229 --> 01:48:19.291]  But he's very disenchanted with both sides of the political parties and he's always posting stuff having to do with immigration, things that, you know,
[01:48:19.833 --> 01:48:39.082]  The antics at the President's poll, my guess is because these emails of these billboards hit so many people out there that maybe are not listening to InfoWars, but also are disenchanted with what's going on, that if you try to get ahold, if you just look up CasaDeIce.com, that's Casa, the letter D, Ice.com.
[01:48:39.182 --> 01:48:40.982]  A lot of us don't know what you're talking about.
[01:48:41.022 --> 01:48:41.963]  What's going on?
[01:48:44.955 --> 01:48:46.276]  A gentleman just has a website.
[01:48:46.316 --> 01:48:49.319]  If you go to CasaDeIce.com, he has a restaurant.
[01:48:49.499 --> 01:48:57.547]  I don't remember what state he's in, but he posts political messages about how disgusted he is with what's going on in our government today.
[01:48:58.147 --> 01:49:04.514]  What I'm saying is, because he's already in that line of thinking of not being happy with what's going on, I think if
[01:49:05.404 --> 01:49:19.255]  Somebody out of your office were to contact him, chitchat a little bit, maybe even have him on, he would probably be more than willing to start posting possibly InfoWars.com on his billboard or otherwise.
[01:49:19.295 --> 01:49:20.216]  Listen, I hear you, sir.
[01:49:20.636 --> 01:49:22.278]  Look, I hear you and I appreciate it.
[01:49:22.798 --> 01:49:24.359]  I'm just getting my new people online.
[01:49:24.399 --> 01:49:30.705]  I'm just getting computers going and editing software and packages and we're reaching millions every day and it's all about you spreading the word about the show.
[01:49:31.585 --> 01:49:36.928]  If somebody wants to contact somebody who's putting billboards up and ask them to put up InfoWars.com or whatever, that's great.
[01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:41.291]  We don't have the money for that and I'm not generally out there, you know.
[01:49:41.731 --> 01:49:48.334]  People tuning in here, you know, want to hear what I have to say so I can tell people what I want to have to say, but I don't really cold call folks up.
[01:49:48.355 --> 01:49:49.755]  But that sounds like an interesting idea.
[01:49:49.775 --> 01:49:54.518]  And if people have the funds out there, don't wait for orders from headquarters, go to the sound of the guns.
[01:49:54.538 --> 01:49:57.860]  You know, some catchy phrase like, don't be a sucker, InfoWars.com.
[01:49:59.515 --> 01:50:00.576]  Or walking billboards.
[01:50:00.616 --> 01:50:02.857]  Get our t-shirts at Infowars.com and get them out.
[01:50:02.897 --> 01:50:04.858]  It's all about getting the word out.
[01:50:04.878 --> 01:50:06.239]  But yes, that's a great idea.
[01:50:06.259 --> 01:50:12.283]  And so, folks, contact whoever this nice fellow is and tell him to wake up to what's going on there.
[01:50:12.523 --> 01:50:14.864]  Yeah, I mean, on the immigration issue, the globalists are for it.
[01:50:14.884 --> 01:50:15.384]  I'm against it.
[01:50:15.564 --> 01:50:17.405]  Then you analyze why they're for it.
[01:50:17.506 --> 01:50:18.966]  Then you're even more against it.
[01:50:19.367 --> 01:50:19.987]  But it's real simple.
[01:50:20.027 --> 01:50:21.208]  Just whatever they're for, you're against.
[01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:24.630]  They want to overrun every nation with third-world populations.
[01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:26.591]  I'm not against these poor third-world populations.
[01:50:27.182 --> 01:50:28.803]  But we can't let it happen.
[01:50:28.823 --> 01:50:36.450]  The globalists wanted to drive down wages, bankrupt the states and their health care and welfare systems for total federalization and then internationalization.
[01:50:37.150 --> 01:50:40.914]  So, you know, I want to get Glenn Spencer back on.
[01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:44.477]  It's probably been a year since I've had Glenn Spencer, AmericanPatrol.com on.
[01:50:44.777 --> 01:50:45.518]  We're going to get Glenn
[01:50:47.154 --> 01:50:47.394]  You worry.
[01:50:47.414 --> 01:50:48.575]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:50:48.615 --> 01:50:51.136]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:50:51.476 --> 01:50:53.297]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[01:51:14.172 --> 01:51:14.672]  We're good to go.
[01:51:44.155 --> 01:51:44.435]  I think so.
[01:52:02.387 --> 01:52:15.119]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:52:15.539 --> 01:52:22.306]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:52:22.646 --> 01:52:26.207]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:52:26.587 --> 01:52:29.787]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:52:30.008 --> 01:52:31.708]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:52:31.768 --> 01:52:37.509]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:52:37.889 --> 01:52:43.090]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:52:43.290 --> 01:52:51.572]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism,
[01:52:51.912 --> 01:52:53.113]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[01:52:53.513 --> 01:52:55.394]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[01:52:55.414 --> 01:52:58.636]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[01:53:14.392 --> 01:53:16.133]  You know that you need to prepare.
[01:53:16.494 --> 01:53:19.516]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[01:53:19.896 --> 01:53:22.879]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[01:53:23.199 --> 01:53:34.588]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:53:34.989 --> 01:53:41.414]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and tobacco.
[01:53:41.954 --> 01:53:43.135]  Before you slip into
[01:54:07.236 --> 01:54:15.579]  Unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[01:54:16.539 --> 01:54:25.481]  Another flashing chance at bliss.
[01:54:25.862 --> 01:54:30.503]  Another kiss, another kiss.
[01:54:44.694 --> 01:54:55.202]  One more great little sponsor for the show today, and that's Ecolablue, the best atmospheric water generator out there, bar none, and it is at an absolutely fabulous price.
[01:54:55.282 --> 01:55:03.089]  Ecolablue.com is the website, and it just grabs water right out of the atmosphere.
[01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.329]  Yes.
[01:55:22.009 --> 01:55:27.392]  On and on and on, UV, antibacterial, fungal, light, and several other filters in there.
[01:55:27.412 --> 01:55:28.472]  It comes in a lot of different colors.
[01:55:28.512 --> 01:55:30.773]  Check them out online at ecoloblue.com.
[01:55:31.093 --> 01:55:33.154]  Ecoloblue.com or that number if you missed it.
[01:55:33.674 --> 01:55:35.735]  It's like a water cooler without the water bottle on the top.
[01:55:35.755 --> 01:55:36.676]  It just grabs it out of the air.
[01:55:36.696 --> 01:55:36.736]  800-691-6043.
[01:55:36.756 --> 01:55:39.137]  Alright, let us now go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:55:48.427 --> 01:55:49.128]  Who's up next year?
[01:55:49.168 --> 01:55:51.050]  Is it Paul or Dan or Betsy or Elliot?
[01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:53.092]  Yeah, Paul in North Carolina.
[01:55:53.132 --> 01:55:53.693]  You're on the air.
[01:55:53.733 --> 01:55:54.053]  Welcome.
[01:55:54.694 --> 01:55:55.475]  Hey, good afternoon Alex.
[01:55:55.495 --> 01:55:56.275]  How are you doing today?
[01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:57.036]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:55:58.218 --> 01:56:01.041]  I just wanted to keep you informed about what's happening on the East Coast.
[01:56:01.141 --> 01:56:04.985]  Fort Bragg, they're increasing the amount of troops within the next year or two.
[01:56:05.526 --> 01:56:05.806]  From 50,000 to 70,000?
[01:56:05.947 --> 01:56:07.008]  I would love to be able to do that.
[01:56:21.127 --> 01:56:39.135]  Eighteen hours a day lately, and I go home and see my family come back at night, and I've gone to bases and off bases and talked to troops that are doing drills to take over the U.S., and people denied it, and now they admit they're doing it, so it's up to the American people to reach out to the troops.
[01:56:40.195 --> 01:56:44.637]  Other than spreading the word, what could I possibly do?
[01:56:45.826 --> 01:56:49.470]  What types of CDs would you like me to pass out to some of the troops?
[01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:51.932]  Because I've gotten to know them within the last couple months.
[01:56:52.032 --> 01:56:52.873]  Okay, okay.
[01:56:53.173 --> 01:57:01.780]  What will impress them is seeing a ten-year-old or eight-year-old film I made, like Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:57:03.062 --> 01:57:07.586]  And I show everything they're training to do, and I document how
[01:57:09.847 --> 01:57:13.689]  Their plan's going to work, and here you are ten years later and it all happened just like I said.
[01:57:14.230 --> 01:57:16.972]  Hey, you know, I've got a 3 CD combo pack.
[01:57:16.992 --> 01:57:18.533]  You can get them, make all the copies you want.
[01:57:18.553 --> 01:57:20.374]  I want you to get them out to people.
[01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:24.776]  I would give them End Game, I would give them Terror Storm, so they know the terror was staged.
[01:57:26.097 --> 01:57:26.698]  Things like that.
[01:57:27.458 --> 01:57:28.639]  And the troops aren't bad people.
[01:57:28.659 --> 01:57:30.600]  They're just brainwashed and ignorant, most of them.
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.961]  Or those that do know what's happening are freaked out.
[01:57:33.581 --> 01:57:36.942]  Well, I mean, you know, the majority of troops gave their money to Ron Paul in the campaign and supported him.
[01:57:36.962 --> 01:57:38.343]  So, you know, it shows they know what's going on.
[01:57:38.563 --> 01:57:39.824]  But the commanders are pure evil.
[01:57:39.844 --> 01:57:42.305]  You can forget trying to wake up the high-level commanders.
[01:57:42.325 --> 01:57:44.626]  They've been picked because they're globalists and hate this country.
[01:57:45.286 --> 01:57:45.807]  They're traitors.
[01:57:46.967 --> 01:57:50.989]  Yeah, the troops have just been conditioned and we just have to un-brainwash them.
[01:57:51.377 --> 01:57:51.717]  That's it.
[01:57:51.757 --> 01:57:52.478]  Appreciate the call.
[01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:53.338]  Jamming in one more.
[01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:54.359]  Dan in Texas.
[01:57:54.379 --> 01:57:55.300]  Sorry to Betsy and everybody.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:56.501]  Oh, Betsy disagrees.
[01:57:57.021 --> 01:57:57.241]  I'm sorry.
[01:57:57.261 --> 01:57:58.102]  We're going to Betsy first.
[01:57:58.522 --> 01:57:59.303]  Betsy in Michigan.
[01:57:59.343 --> 01:57:59.723]  Go ahead.
[01:57:59.743 --> 01:58:03.226]  Hey, it's actually Beastie, not Betsy.
[01:58:03.306 --> 01:58:03.566]  Okay.
[01:58:03.586 --> 01:58:05.347]  Well, your name's Betsy now for disagreeing.
[01:58:05.928 --> 01:58:06.648]  Okay, Beastie.
[01:58:07.169 --> 01:58:10.831]  I have a simple, simple disagreement, which is, you know, you actually said it earlier.
[01:58:11.112 --> 01:58:14.114]  I don't think we need to, you always say, don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[01:58:14.214 --> 01:58:14.894]  I think it helps.
[01:58:15.275 --> 01:58:16.295]  I'll give you two examples.
[01:58:16.335 --> 01:58:16.896]  One was when
[01:58:17.492 --> 01:58:23.838]  Um, Mark, when Mark Dice did the, uh, Inform-A-Soldier campaign, where he came up with an idea and we spread it out there.
[01:58:23.878 --> 01:58:25.119]  Like, he gave orders from headquarters.
[01:58:25.139 --> 01:58:29.202]  You did the same thing, when, before 9-11, on your, uh, Access Show.
[01:58:29.442 --> 01:58:31.404]  No, no, I agree to a certain extent.
[01:58:31.464 --> 01:58:34.406]  I'm just saying, don't wait for me to tell you what to do to take action.
[01:58:34.787 --> 01:58:35.147]  Okay?
[01:58:35.367 --> 01:58:36.989]  God bless you all, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:37.029 --> 01:58:41.392]  Retransmission starts now with all those big guests, Peter Schiff, you name it, at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:41.412 --> 01:58:42.013]  Rebroadcast.

[01:58:53.977 --> 01:58:58.599]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:58.719 --> 01:59:01.501]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:01.681 --> 01:59:04.542]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:04.722 --> 01:59:09.445]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:09.665 --> 01:59:10.606]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:10.806 --> 01:59:13.728]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:14.048 --> 01:59:20.932]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:21.032 --> 01:59:24.154]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:59:40.165 --> 01:59:40.646]  Take action today.
[01:59:40.666 --> 01:59:42.127]  The first step is getting storable food.
