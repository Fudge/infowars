[00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.872]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:12.157]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are now in the third hour of this global transmission, January 12th, 2009.
[00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:22.164]  I am Jason Bermas, subbing in for you here at PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, and on all of our AM and FM affiliates.
[00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:25.106]  I want to play this clip.
[00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:26.842]  We haven't played this one.
[00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:39.533]  We discussed the Colin Powell warning, but I also want to show that not only Joe Biden, Colin Powell, but Madeleine Albright also said that Obama would be under a crisis in the first couple of months of his presidency.
[00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:40.734]  So what is this crisis?
[00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:42.316]  Let's go to the video.
[00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:43.497]  Let's go to Albright.
[00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:56.885]  I want to ask you what you thought of what Joe Biden said yesterday in terms of this idea that now Senator Obama, if he becomes president, will be tested by an international crisis within the first six months.
[00:00:56.985 --> 00:00:59.407]  John McCain certainly picked up on that.
[00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:00.788]  Let's listen to what he said yesterday.
[00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:01.828]  Okay.
[00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:11.114]  If Senator Obama is elected, Senator Biden said we will have an international crisis to test America's new president.
[00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:20.967]  We don't want a president who invites testing from the world at a time when our economy is in crisis, and Americans are already fighting in two wars.
[00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:24.048]  I'll note in there what Senator McCain thought about this, Thomas.
[00:01:24.068 --> 00:01:25.448]  What did you think about what Senator McCain said?
[00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:28.029]  Well, I think it's just a statement of fact, frankly.
[00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:36.812]  And in my book, I talk about the fact that there are a lot of big issues out there, but that also something unexpected, you always have to be prepared for that.
[00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:39.366]  A statement of fact.
[00:01:39.646 --> 00:01:41.827]  What do these people know that we don't know?
[00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.029]  These are insiders, folks.
[00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.090]  Let's bring up the Powell clip as well.
[00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.012]  You know, I want to play that Powell clip one more time.
[00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:57.518]  I mean, the way that Powell actually says this, and let's cut it off before it goes all blue or whatever, the way that Powell actually says this, it is extremely frightening.
[00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:02.321]  I mean, I just... I don't know why we're not more alarmed about this.
[00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:03.862]  I don't know why it hasn't been talked about.
[00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:07.385]  A few people have really picked up on it, but now we're a little
[00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:09.972]  Over a week away from the inauguration.
[00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:14.175]  We're really only a little over a week from this information, if it's true, if there's really going to be a crisis.
[00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:15.235]  So let's play Powell Point.
[00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:16.056]  Say it up.
[00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:27.803]  Start with talking to the American people and talking to the world and conveying a new image of American leadership, a new image of America's role in the world.
[00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:35.368]  The problems will always be there and there's going to be a crisis come along on the 21st or 22nd of January that we don't even know about right now.
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.920]  How do we not know about it?
[00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:41.141]  How does he know about it and we don't?
[00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:42.761]  All right, let's keep taking your calls.
[00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:44.562]  Let's go to Christina in Maryland.
[00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:45.562]  Christina, what's on your mind?
[00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:49.583]  Christina, are you there?
[00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:56.205]  Hey, I just wanted to make a comment about yesterday's recording.
[00:02:56.225 --> 00:03:02.687]  You said that Minister Lewis Farquhar made a comment that he believed that Obama was a messiah.
[00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:07.481]  And that statement is not true.
[00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:19.827]  You did call yesterday and I believe his exact words is the youth listen when the Messiah speaks and the Messiah is speaking and I am almost a hundred percent sure that he is
[00:03:20.807 --> 00:03:22.528]  Referring to Obama.
[00:03:22.548 --> 00:03:23.368]  We're going to play the clip.
[00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:25.409]  We're going to put the controversy to rest.
[00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.029]  Christina, it'll come up in the next segment.
[00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:27.870]  I thank you for the call.
[00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.731]  Let's move on to Dave in California.
[00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:35.392]  You've got to understand, folks, you know, he's not the only one calling Obama the Messiah.
[00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:45.116]  Just type in Obama Messiah and there's plenty of mainstream articles out there in places like the Huffington Post, left-wing publications, where
[00:03:46.718 --> 00:03:48.799]  Where again, they're saying he's the one.
[00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:49.860]  He's the one that's going to lead us out.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.001]  He's on the cover of every magazine.
[00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:53.942]  He's on the cover of The Amazing Spider-Man.
[00:03:53.962 --> 00:03:55.644]  We're going to pull that picture up in a moment too.
[00:03:56.424 --> 00:03:59.746]  Alright, play Farrakhan Sain and then we'll take Dave in California.
[00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:09.812]  That God is going to use to bring about universal change.
[00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:14.895]  And that is why Barack has captured
[00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:25.106]  When the Messiah speaks, it's Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:45.143 --> 00:04:48.968]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.
[00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:55.075]  Right now at MainMilitary.com, you'll find savings on the top must-have military supplies.
[00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:55.796]  M10 gas masks for $12 or 3 for $30.
[00:04:55.856 --> 00:04:56.897]  Gas mask hoods, $4 or 3 for $10.
[00:04:56.977 --> 00:04:57.778]  Mask filters, $6 or 3 for $15.
[00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:06.866]  Save big on British chemical suits, only twelve dollars.
[00:05:07.086 --> 00:05:08.927]  Israeli gas masks, twenty dollars.
[00:05:09.167 --> 00:05:12.568]  Trigger finger gloves, five dollars a pair or thirty-six dollars a dozen.
[00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:15.970]  Snowshoe binding for eight dollars or forty-eight dollars a dozen.
[00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.170]  And so much more.
[00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.872]  Even hard to find surplus items, all at surplus prices.
[00:05:21.172 --> 00:05:23.973]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable.
[00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:24.813]  We're good to go.
[00:05:44.235 --> 00:05:45.897]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:05:46.198 --> 00:05:49.662]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:05:49.823 --> 00:05:51.665]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:55.009]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.155]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[00:05:59.155 --> 00:05:59.415]  We're good.
[00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:35.077]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:37.198]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[00:06:37.238 --> 00:06:38.938]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:39.839]  Everyone needs something to
[00:07:04.531 --> 00:07:11.495]  TPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:12.716]  Need something more?
[00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:16.758]  The Stinger Keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:25.363]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival spy and tactical gear.

[00:07:30.827 --> 00:07:32.548]  That's MRDefense.com.
[00:07:44.677 --> 00:07:46.862]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:47.443 --> 00:07:50.229]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:58.211]  Alright folks, we're back and we're going to play that Louis Farrakhan calling Obama the Messiah clip one more time.
[00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:02.812]  And let's say, let's say he's not referring to Obama as the Messiah.
[00:08:03.212 --> 00:08:08.494]  He's saying that the Messiah is ordaining Obama, which is, I would say, just as bad, if not worse.
[00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.174]  So, you decide.
[00:08:10.214 --> 00:08:10.735]  Here it is.
[00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:13.635]  Farrakhan, Obama, Messiah.
[00:08:13.675 --> 00:08:14.396]  Let's play the clip.
[00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:21.938]  Instruments that God is going to use to bring about
[00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:24.322]  Universal change.
[00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:31.406]  And that is why Barack has captured the youth.
[00:08:33.327 --> 00:08:41.151]  And he has involved young people in a political process that they didn't care anything about.
[00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:43.232]  That's a sign.
[00:08:45.113 --> 00:08:50.076]  When the Messiah speaks, the youth will hear.
[00:08:54.238 --> 00:09:00.802]  I don't see how you can really interpret that any other way, frankly.
[00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:27.916]  You know what, she... I gotta tell you, I talked to her on the show yesterday.
[00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:33.203]  I am a fan of how, first of all, Nation of Islam Muslims know about government corruption.
[00:09:33.343 --> 00:09:34.404]  A lot of them are in the know.
[00:09:34.444 --> 00:09:36.747]  They know that there's something wrong with both political parties.
[00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:38.610]  However, and...
[00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:57.955]  Faircon is able to mobilize a lot of people, the man behind the Million Man March, the Millions More March, which is a positive thing, but when he gets up there and he backs a candidate who is a globalist candidate, somebody who is promoting this One World Order, you know, global citizenship and the like, he's not going to get us out of the war.
[00:09:58.295 --> 00:10:00.035]  He's just a slick package.
[00:10:00.415 --> 00:10:05.977]  I think that's a huge problem, and I think it's a bigger problem when this religious figure refers to him as the Messiah.
[00:10:06.657 --> 00:10:07.097]  Go ahead, Dave.
[00:10:07.537 --> 00:10:07.997]  I agree with you.
[00:10:09.262 --> 00:10:11.303]  And he talks about universal change.
[00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:12.463]  That bothers me a little bit.
[00:10:12.503 --> 00:10:15.244]  That sounds like code for New World Order stuff to me.
[00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:17.145]  It's upsetting.
[00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:21.207]  Farrakhan, again, he's done some decent things.
[00:10:21.247 --> 00:10:27.149]  He's not on the top list of my demons, but again, he has a lot of people under his wing.
[00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:35.092]  There are a lot of Nation of Islam Muslims, or Bowtie Muslims as I like to call them, and he has a huge sway over them.
[00:10:36.112 --> 00:10:47.519]  You know, religion in so many cases is used to really block people's vision and coordinate them on agendas that really have nothing to do with the religion at all, and that's what worries me.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.261]  Okay, well I got two fast things for you.
[00:10:51.162 --> 00:10:52.823]  First, Fabled Enemy is rocks, man.
[00:10:53.143 --> 00:10:53.623]  Oh, thank you.
[00:10:54.023 --> 00:10:55.024]  Big time prop for that.
[00:10:55.144 --> 00:11:02.869]  Anybody that can watch Barry Jennings talking about the giant explosions going off at number seven while the towers are still standing, how the lobby was annihilated,
[00:11:03.482 --> 00:11:10.664]  And then claim that the official story is anything but garbage is just wasting your time and that's a good way to sort out the morons out there.
[00:11:12.164 --> 00:11:19.906]  Secondly, I have a suggestion for those folks, you know, who are like me and probably you and everybody else in the truth movement are just getting fed up.
[00:11:21.226 --> 00:11:26.608]  Who want to viciously attack the evil leaders with truth but without violence.
[00:11:27.248 --> 00:11:32.169]  And I suggest that we consider attacking their symbols of power and their fake honor.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.942]  Because they set great stock in the adulation of the public and their magical, fake power.
[00:11:40.023 --> 00:11:58.009]  That's interesting because this didn't get reported on most of the alternative news networks, but the Georgia Guidestones were pretty defaced and somebody had went to the Georgia Guidestones, they had spray-painted 9-11 was an inside job, F your new world order, I think Infowars.com was spray-painted on there.
[00:11:58.209 --> 00:12:00.710]  Look, I'm not saying, you haven't seen this yet?
[00:12:02.571 --> 00:12:04.051]  It's pretty wild.
[00:12:05.132 --> 00:12:07.913]  I did see something about a guy standing out in front of it with some signs.
[00:12:18.417 --> 00:12:24.203]  I'm not telling people to break the law, but you know there's an all-seeing eye right under the World Trade Center.
[00:12:24.223 --> 00:12:29.148]  Anybody who's visited the New York subway station, in the subway station, you know we're going to pull a picture of that up too.
[00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:32.231]  I'll pull them up during the break and we'll have them for the next segment.
[00:12:33.832 --> 00:12:40.055]  First of all, when you get off at the World Trade Center stop, there's a bunch of just eyes all over the place, these little mosaic eye tiles, right?
[00:12:40.395 --> 00:12:52.621]  So then when you go to go up the stairs and come out of the port right there by the World Trade Center, there's just this little, it's like a lower fenced-off area, and there's another mosaic, and it's a mosaic of the entire world.
[00:12:52.921 --> 00:12:58.204]  And in the middle of the world is a pulsating, all-seeing eye that pulsates through the entire
[00:12:58.704 --> 00:12:59.585]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:12:59.805 --> 00:13:00.686]  I'll be real quick.
[00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:01.286]  Just a couple things.
[00:13:01.306 --> 00:13:02.027]  I've been a listener.
[00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:02.767]  My eyes were opened.
[00:13:26.758 --> 00:13:35.925]  The early nineties during the Clinton administration, of course Oklahoma City happened and I knew that everything that I felt instinctively was accurate.
[00:13:37.146 --> 00:13:38.707]  But I'm originally from Houston.
[00:13:38.747 --> 00:13:40.268]  I moved out here to Alpine, Texas.
[00:13:40.288 --> 00:13:41.669]  I don't know if you know where Alpine is.
[00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.111]  No, I don't.
[00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:48.354]  It's about 90 miles from the Presidio border.
[00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:54.318]  It's Fort Stockton, about 75 miles south of Midland, Odessa.
[00:13:54.738 --> 00:13:55.679]  If you look on the map,
[00:13:56.956 --> 00:14:03.678]  I'm down there in the corner from the panhandle of the very most southern part of the state for the most part, but a couple things.
[00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:12.101]  Looking at Google Maps and pulling up the FEMA concentration camps around the United States, there's a plethora of them, but there's none in my area.
[00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:19.964]  It's kind of confusing because we actually have the highest law enforcement per capita than anybody in the United States.
[00:14:20.904 --> 00:14:22.504]  We have U.S.
[00:14:22.604 --> 00:14:24.265]  Marshals, the Border Patrol is huge.
[00:14:25.384 --> 00:14:28.785]  Sheriff's Department and Homeland Security office here as well.
[00:14:30.205 --> 00:14:32.405]  And I'm watching a huge influx daily.
[00:14:32.425 --> 00:14:43.127]  I have an office here right off the highway and I see more and more and more Border Patrol trucks, vehicles, and agents traveling to work every day.
[00:14:43.668 --> 00:14:45.268]  Every day that I see is growing.
[00:14:45.288 --> 00:14:50.929]  So I was wondering if you had an insight on why this particular area
[00:14:51.947 --> 00:14:57.992]  Um, it's obviously also the entrance port called La Entrada to the Texas, the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:02.515]  Well, they just said that they killed the Trans-Texas Corridor and all they're going to do is rename it.
[00:15:02.575 --> 00:15:03.656]  You know, it's not going anywhere.
[00:15:03.856 --> 00:15:09.920]  That's exactly what Alex had said, is that it makes it more difficult to challenge it if it's against multiple entities versus one.
[00:15:10.781 --> 00:15:11.401]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:11.461 --> 00:15:17.305]  There's a video online called, um, The Truth Be Told, T-O-L-L-E-D.
[00:15:20.154 --> 00:15:27.022]  Which is a great video for people who have no idea what the ultimate purpose of the Trans-Texas Corridor is.
[00:15:27.803 --> 00:15:32.368]  But I moved out here because it's the last slice of America.
[00:15:33.271 --> 00:15:36.233]  I don't know if it's the last place in America.
[00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:51.901]  We're good to go.
[00:16:19.554 --> 00:16:21.755]  You know, that's why there's great organizations out there.
[00:16:21.775 --> 00:16:23.675]  You know, I love 9-11 Blogger.
[00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:25.876]  We can't do it all here at Infowars.com.
[00:16:26.156 --> 00:16:29.437]  You know, I like some of the stuff that GNN does, Guerrilla News Network.
[00:16:29.797 --> 00:16:37.699]  You know, even some of the stuff that Huffington Post and Raw Story put out there, at least they're getting people to think and get them to be somewhat aware.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.640]  Alright, let's go to our next caller.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.761]  Let's go to Tony in Illinois.
[00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:42.621]  Tony, what's on your mind?
[00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:45.742]  Hey, what's going on, Jason?
[00:16:46.902 --> 00:16:48.983]  Not much, just trying to fight the New World Order, my man.
[00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.591]  I hear you.
[00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:51.471]  Same thing.
[00:16:51.531 --> 00:16:54.793]  I'm here in the big, beautiful Chicago prison grid.
[00:16:55.133 --> 00:16:56.254]  It's wonderful here.
[00:16:56.314 --> 00:17:07.820]  I don't know how much time you spend here in Chicago, but I know if you spend any time, you know, it's fairly multicultural and predominantly, it's predominantly black.
[00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:15.585]  Since the election of Barack Obama, now the workforce, the workplace, I got to tell you about this because this is insanity.
[00:17:16.331 --> 00:17:20.412]  The workplace I work in is 80% black environment.
[00:17:21.012 --> 00:17:22.372]  I don't care about any of that.
[00:17:22.432 --> 00:17:23.653]  That doesn't bother me at all.
[00:17:23.693 --> 00:17:33.555]  What bothers me, though, is that people want to talk about the world situation and, heaven forbid, the look of horror on their faces.
[00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:43.657]  Not just from supporters, but from people who you know are not for this guy and are looking at you like, oh my God, you're dare talking about him in public.
[00:17:44.244 --> 00:17:45.266]  It's frightening.
[00:17:45.746 --> 00:17:46.367]  It really is.
[00:17:46.928 --> 00:17:49.372]  I'm starting to really feel like Winston Smith out here.
[00:17:49.392 --> 00:17:51.214]  I don't know about you, but...
[00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:00.807]  I wish he'd zoomed out just a little bit.
[00:18:00.827 --> 00:18:02.848]  But you know, he's on the cover of the Amazing Spider-Man.
[00:18:02.908 --> 00:18:03.408]  He's hip.
[00:18:03.768 --> 00:18:04.749]  He's going to bump him.
[00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:09.912]  But when I go into the malls, and usually go to Albany for my mall, it's, you know, the capital of New York.
[00:18:10.332 --> 00:18:12.673]  I mean, it is just littered with Obama-ware.
[00:18:12.873 --> 00:18:15.415]  You know, I mean, literally, like, it's hip now.
[00:18:15.435 --> 00:18:17.456]  He's like a symbol like Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:18:17.776 --> 00:18:18.716]  I got news for you folks.
[00:18:18.956 --> 00:18:25.340]  He's got a long way to go before he can even be considered to be in the same room as Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.000]  Oh yeah!
[00:18:27.501 --> 00:18:28.021]  It's amazing.
[00:18:28.061 --> 00:18:33.004]  Jason, let me tell you about something I saw today, just on the news today with Pepsi.
[00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:54.498]  I don't know if you guys have seen this yet, but Pepsi's got a new ad campaign going on where they have replaced the Pepsi logo, the red, white, and blue, or the red and blue with the white ribbon across, and shifted it to where it looks almost exactly like the Obama, you know, all-seeing eye symbol.
[00:18:55.465 --> 00:19:06.791]  And it's all about, uh, it's about basically Obama worship being linked to product choice, and it's, and, uh... Well, that's, uh, that's what I was describing earlier.
[00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:08.031]  Uh, oh wow, look at that.
[00:19:09.572 --> 00:19:09.612]  Um...
[00:19:11.181 --> 00:19:14.802]  It's exactly, again, change, hope, we, change, hope, we.
[00:19:15.062 --> 00:19:16.683]  That's what the predictive programming has been.
[00:19:16.923 --> 00:19:18.404]  That's the new commercials everywhere.
[00:19:18.684 --> 00:19:20.084]  That's, I mean, there it is right there.
[00:19:20.404 --> 00:19:20.745]  Bring it up.
[00:19:21.405 --> 00:19:21.925]  There it is.
[00:19:22.045 --> 00:19:24.686]  It is almost exactly like the new Obama logo.
[00:19:24.726 --> 00:19:25.366]  How about that?
[00:19:26.047 --> 00:19:26.387]  Weird.
[00:19:28.087 --> 00:19:29.148]  It's a coincidence, right?
[00:19:29.228 --> 00:19:30.208]  It's all just a dream.
[00:19:32.169 --> 00:19:34.690]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.570]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:37.791]  We'll be back after this.
[00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:53.168]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:19:53.328 --> 00:20:01.356]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:20:01.497 --> 00:20:01.817]  In fact,
[00:20:01.997 --> 00:20:05.999]  Clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:08.700]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:20.145]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:20:20.405 --> 00:20:26.587]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:30.529]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[00:20:30.769 --> 00:20:34.570]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[00:20:37.651 --> 00:20:39.851]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[00:20:40.011 --> 00:20:42.012]  Or call 888-949-3570.
[00:20:42.052 --> 00:20:50.833]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:51.174 --> 00:20:52.934]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:53.806 --> 00:20:54.847]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:55.367 --> 00:20:55.867]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:56.147 --> 00:20:57.148]  This is his ammo.
[00:20:57.168 --> 00:20:58.469]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:58.509 --> 00:21:00.190]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:07.274]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:07.674 --> 00:21:08.114]  Some U.S.
[00:21:08.154 --> 00:21:13.818]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:14.498 --> 00:21:17.979]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:20.800]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:45.692 --> 00:21:47.674]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:21:48.054 --> 00:21:54.019]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?
[00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:58.183]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of The International Forecaster.

[00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:22.539]  I think so.
[00:22:44.033 --> 00:22:45.514]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:22:45.714 --> 00:22:47.156]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:22:47.456 --> 00:22:49.698]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:22:50.138 --> 00:22:54.882]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:22:55.282 --> 00:22:58.125]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:22:58.465 --> 00:23:01.968]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:23:02.378 --> 00:23:14.345]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system, which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:23:14.925 --> 00:23:16.907]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:23:16.927 --> 00:23:18.227]  I use one every day.
[00:23:18.648 --> 00:23:21.089]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:23:21.349 --> 00:23:21.910]  We're good.
[00:23:52.634 --> 00:23:54.255]  Alright, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:54.715 --> 00:23:55.875]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:23:58.316 --> 00:24:05.138]  And before we keep taking your calls, remember we're going to have Matthew Medina from We Are Change San Antonio on at the top of the hour.
[00:24:06.338 --> 00:24:10.380]  I want to shift gears a little bit, you know, wide open phones, whatever you want to talk about.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.341]  We've been talking a lot of Obama and Biden today, a little bit of Pakistan.
[00:24:13.621 --> 00:24:17.242]  But we also touched upon these genetically modified pigs.
[00:24:18.616 --> 00:24:23.641]  And why this is important is because it's now growing outside of just lab stuff.
[00:24:23.941 --> 00:24:24.942]  And what do I mean by lab stuff?
[00:24:24.962 --> 00:24:29.286]  Well, they create this stuff, it's fancy, but we're not going to breed them or anything, are we?
[00:24:29.546 --> 00:24:33.230]  Well yeah, we just created a new type of pig!
[00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:34.551]  They're breeding!
[00:24:35.191 --> 00:24:37.133]  Two of the nine piglets glow-in-the-dark, folks.
[00:24:37.834 --> 00:24:40.837]  And we're now creating species on this Earth.
[00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:43.393]  That is incredible!
[00:24:43.694 --> 00:24:54.076]  It's almost god-like, and I'm sure that the scientists that are doing this are not only thinking that, but I guess it's one thing to do this in a back lab or to show something on display.
[00:24:54.116 --> 00:25:04.278]  It's another thing to start creating genetic organisms, even more so than just plant life, I guess, and creating these animals.
[00:25:04.399 --> 00:25:05.519]  I mean, what is next?
[00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:09.540]  So, let's go to the glowing piglets.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.300]  That's what we want to see.
[00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:20.175]  Beans were altered to make it glow fluorescent green, has given birth to a pair of fluorescent piglets.
[00:25:20.815 --> 00:25:23.437]  Thank goodness we finally reached that scientific milestone.
[00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:28.981]  Mama Pig gave birth to a litter of 11 in China over the weekend, and two of its babies came out glowing.
[00:25:29.441 --> 00:25:36.245]  Scientists say the piglet's birth proves that genetically modified pigs can pass on their engineered traits to their young.
[00:25:36.265 --> 00:25:41.209]  Researchers now want to see if they can grow human organs in pigs to use in transplants.
[00:25:41.709 --> 00:25:44.391]  For MSNBC.com, I'm Willie Geist.
[00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:50.912]  And you notice how he threw in that they now want to see whether or not they can grow human organs inside of them.
[00:25:50.932 --> 00:25:52.653]  No, they were doing that in 2002, okay?
[00:25:53.913 --> 00:25:56.994]  And of the 11 pigs, two of them came out with the genes.
[00:25:57.034 --> 00:26:03.295]  Well, the other nine still carry the traits, so when they have piglets, some of their piglets will more than likely also glow in the dark.
[00:26:05.995 --> 00:26:08.876]  We've changed the structure of pigs forever.
[00:26:09.056 --> 00:26:12.477]  Eventually, these will interbreed into the rest of the population.
[00:26:13.097 --> 00:26:13.417]  I mean, man.
[00:26:15.593 --> 00:26:17.755]  It is wild what man has really done.
[00:26:17.775 --> 00:26:20.317]  It's unbelievable.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.982]  All right, let's go to Mark in Oregon.
[00:26:27.302 --> 00:26:28.143]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[00:26:29.904 --> 00:26:31.005]  Hey Jason, how you doing?
[00:26:31.405 --> 00:26:31.606]  Good.
[00:26:32.706 --> 00:26:41.713]  Jason, you know, I'd spoken with you about six months ago, and by the way, it's great to hear you on the airwaves again and to see Alex get such a well-over-deserved vacation there.
[00:26:42.154 --> 00:26:42.574]  Oh, thank you.
[00:26:43.895 --> 00:26:46.517]  And I brought up the film by Eric Huffschmidt.
[00:26:47.098 --> 00:26:48.099]  You know how to spell that?
[00:26:48.159 --> 00:26:51.582]  It's H-U-F-F-S-C-H-M-I-D-T, I believe.
[00:26:51.602 --> 00:26:52.682]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[00:26:52.702 --> 00:26:54.124]  Are you talking about Painful Deceptions?
[00:26:55.084 --> 00:26:57.346]  Right, and I think it's Painful Questions.
[00:26:57.566 --> 00:26:59.128]  Okay, the Deceptions is the book, sure.
[00:26:59.788 --> 00:27:01.850]  Yeah, Painful Questions is the video.
[00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:04.812]  Excuse me, and that's what I'm referring to here.
[00:27:05.253 --> 00:27:10.437]  You get up in that video, somewhere in the body of it, more or less halfway through it or so,
[00:27:11.508 --> 00:27:11.709]  Mm-hmm.
[00:27:11.969 --> 00:27:17.232]  And a frame comes up that shows a still photograph of a Global Hog Missile parked on a runway.
[00:27:17.252 --> 00:27:18.473]  Okay.
[00:27:18.493 --> 00:27:33.082]  And the very next frame is one of, it's the only one I've ever seen, and there may be others, I haven't seen a whole lot of videos, but it's the very next frame that follows the photograph of the Global Hog Missile, which, of course, as you're aware of, looks like a small airplane.
[00:27:33.102 --> 00:27:35.083]  Mm-hmm.
[00:27:35.103 --> 00:27:39.946]  And it shows the inside of the hole that was made in the Pentagon by whatever hit it.
[00:27:41.058 --> 00:27:45.941]  And of course, it's widely speculated that a Global Hawk missile was involved there.
[00:27:46.861 --> 00:27:49.623]  And it actually put some lights inside the hole.
[00:27:49.983 --> 00:27:55.346]  There's someone shining some lights into the hole so that you can actually see pretty well what's inside of that hole.
[00:27:56.586 --> 00:28:05.451]  And when you look off to the right-hand side, inside the hole here, you see an inflated tire with the wheel still
[00:28:06.406 --> 00:28:07.248]  Yeah, I think I see that.
[00:28:20.939 --> 00:28:27.945]  With the actual picture of the wheel of the Global Hawk Missile in the frame immediately preceding that, and they are identical.
[00:28:28.145 --> 00:28:29.766]  And it's a very small tire.
[00:28:30.187 --> 00:28:32.308]  It would not even be used on a 727.
[00:28:32.408 --> 00:28:33.990]  Well, I would say this.
[00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.852]  You know, take a screenshot, send us the info.
[00:28:37.433 --> 00:28:40.735]  I may have seen the thing before, but send it over to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[00:28:40.815 --> 00:28:43.838]  I'll have to let you look it up because I'm not on the internet, okay?
[00:28:44.018 --> 00:28:45.599]  Or some of the listeners.
[00:28:45.659 --> 00:28:49.843]  But anyway, if you can spell it out for people and give the right name of the video for people,
[00:28:51.407 --> 00:28:51.968]  Sure, you got it.
[00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.192]  It's painful deceptions.
[00:28:53.212 --> 00:28:53.894]  I thank you for the call.
[00:28:53.934 --> 00:28:56.602]  Let's go to Kyle in Alabama.
[00:28:56.642 --> 00:28:57.504]  Kyle, what's on your mind?
[00:28:58.345 --> 00:28:59.065]  Oh no, Kyle hung up.
[00:28:59.125 --> 00:28:59.465]  I'm sorry.
[00:28:59.805 --> 00:29:01.946]  Let's go Mr. X in Texas.
[00:29:02.406 --> 00:29:03.306]  I love these fake names.
[00:29:03.647 --> 00:29:04.367]  What did I have yesterday?
[00:29:04.387 --> 00:29:08.128]  I had Captain Kook, Mr. X, we had Turbo today.
[00:29:08.588 --> 00:29:08.848]  Really?
[00:29:09.208 --> 00:29:11.049]  Is it so hard to say, hey, my name's Mark?
[00:29:11.849 --> 00:29:13.729]  Alright, we're going to take that call.
[00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.950]  We're going to take Mr. X and others on the other side.
[00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.011]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:18.031 --> 00:29:21.252]  Remember, you can tune in live right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:34.375 --> 00:29:35.315]  We're on the march.
[00:29:35.755 --> 00:29:37.376]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:38.296 --> 00:29:41.077]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:44.738 --> 00:29:50.180]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.740]  And we knew what to do.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.541]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:29:53.781 --> 00:30:00.183]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:30:00.783 --> 00:30:04.004]  Whitman, EPA Director,
[00:30:04.488 --> 00:30:09.370]  On the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:16.494]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:30:16.794 --> 00:30:19.875]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:30:19.955 --> 00:30:25.178]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:30:25.738 --> 00:30:28.279]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:30:28.817 --> 00:30:34.662]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:30:34.863 --> 00:30:37.405]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:37.785 --> 00:30:42.710]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:30:44.731 --> 00:30:46.892]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[00:30:47.412 --> 00:30:51.974]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with the reflective spray.
[00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:54.295]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:55.535]  We are under the microscope.
[00:30:55.715 --> 00:30:59.556]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[00:30:59.737 --> 00:31:03.118]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.
[00:31:03.358 --> 00:31:06.439]  Have a fighting chance with SprayYourPlate.com's Photoblocker.
[00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:06.839]  I think so.
[00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:22.391]  I think so.
[00:31:44.312 --> 00:31:47.573]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:31:47.753 --> 00:31:51.835]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:31:52.015 --> 00:32:03.440]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:09.502]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:32:09.742 --> 00:32:10.363]  We're good to go.
[00:32:33.277 --> 00:32:34.279]  We're good to go.
[00:33:09.443 --> 00:33:10.324]  All right, we're back.
[00:33:10.344 --> 00:33:11.545]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.605 --> 00:33:12.627]  I am Jason Vermas.
[00:33:14.048 --> 00:33:14.789]  We're taking your calls.
[00:33:14.829 --> 00:33:20.295]  We're going to have Matthew Medina from We Are Change San Antonio up in a little under a half an hour.
[00:33:20.335 --> 00:33:20.635]  This is
[00:33:21.641 --> 00:33:22.382]  The long segment.
[00:33:22.402 --> 00:33:24.503]  We just played you glowing pig clips.
[00:33:25.184 --> 00:33:33.851]  That's right, we've changed the genetic structure of pigs to make them glow and it'll probably infiltrate the entire species and we'll have all sorts of nice little goodies.
[00:33:35.292 --> 00:33:41.417]  And then they say, oh, but it's for research so that we can grow human organs in them and we'll have organ transplants for everybody.
[00:33:42.077 --> 00:33:43.898]  Be nice if it was true, but they've been doing that since 2002.
[00:33:43.938 --> 00:33:49.920]  You don't think that they've somewhat... I mean, they may not have perfected it, but made it good enough so that they could actually do that.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:58.043]  Listen, if it ever does come along, it's gonna cost so much money and really only be for probably upper to middle class to lower level elites.
[00:33:59.243 --> 00:34:02.904]  It's not for you and I. I'm sorry, I hate to tell you, we are the surf class.
[00:34:03.324 --> 00:34:04.265]  You know what's for you and I?
[00:34:05.125 --> 00:34:07.986]  Diet Pepsi with Obama logos on them, apparently.
[00:34:09.028 --> 00:34:10.129]  And we showed that earlier.
[00:34:10.249 --> 00:34:19.375]  I can't believe it, but they did just change their little logo to something that looks a lot, not exactly like the little Obama O, but for some reason they did put it in a circle.
[00:34:19.415 --> 00:34:20.296]  It looks a lot similar.
[00:34:21.316 --> 00:34:21.737]  God knows.
[00:34:22.137 --> 00:34:23.138]  Alright, let's keep taking your calls.
[00:34:23.158 --> 00:34:24.819]  Let's go to Mr. X in Texas.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:26.860]  Hello, Jason.
[00:34:27.621 --> 00:34:28.141]  How you doing, man?
[00:34:29.162 --> 00:34:29.442]  Hello.
[00:34:30.643 --> 00:34:38.108]  The reason why I'm not giving my real name is because I am a, or I've been used by the CIA as an operative.
[00:34:39.552 --> 00:34:48.118]  Uh, I want to first talk about... Oh, I first want to say that I would not discuss this if I was not given clearance to discuss it.
[00:34:49.138 --> 00:34:50.239]  Uh, make of that what you will.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:35:01.327]  Um, as you might recall, being a journalist, in August of 06, uh, we started hearing about, uh, liquid explosives being smuggled onto airplanes.
[00:35:02.007 --> 00:35:02.187]  Okay.
[00:35:02.207 --> 00:35:07.791]  And that's a couple years back, the liquid explosives plot, which was led back to really ties to the ISI.
[00:35:08.652 --> 00:35:11.295]  Yes.
[00:35:11.695 --> 00:35:18.363]  Mr. Bush, our president, got on the air and said a terrorist plot was foiled by a CIA operative codenamed Mastermind.
[00:35:19.864 --> 00:35:20.445]  This was me.
[00:35:20.845 --> 00:35:30.756]  I went to Spain in August of 08, and at the time I was being watched by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:35.029]  Are the intelligence communities that stick a label on the CIA?
[00:35:35.049 --> 00:35:36.089]  We're really limited.
[00:35:36.129 --> 00:35:38.010]  You really need to say it's the intelligence community.
[00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:38.970]  Okay.
[00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:48.495]  And while while there, I was in a cafe, and the computer activated a screen popped up.
[00:35:48.955 --> 00:35:49.855]  It was from the CIA.
[00:35:49.975 --> 00:35:52.216]  And I began to be asked all these questions.
[00:35:52.716 --> 00:35:53.697]  I answered all the questions.
[00:35:53.737 --> 00:35:55.898]  And at the end, I was given the designation mastermind.
[00:35:56.758 --> 00:35:58.079]  And then on the
[00:35:59.898 --> 00:36:13.604]  Trip back, there was an attempt to put the liquid explosives by the CIA into my bags to have me be a Patsy or Fallout guy for this terrorist agenda that they were trying to push.
[00:36:14.855 --> 00:36:35.134]  Well listen man, I gotta tell you, I mean, we're live radio, your story sounds interesting, obviously I can't confirm it over the air, please send us some information, that doesn't mean you have to send us your name, set up a bogus email account, send it from a coffee shop, if this is legitimate, give us something that, you know, we can confirm any of this, and I'm sure Alex will have you on for a full hour to discuss it.
[00:36:35.314 --> 00:36:36.154]  I thank you for the call.
[00:36:37.458 --> 00:36:39.460]  Um, let's go to Derek in Texas.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:49.488]  Folks, when you get calls like that, you know, it's like, first of all, this isn't the, uh, coast-to-coast, and I like George Norrie and everything like that, but, you know, there are plenty of people that like to just call up and say whatever.
[00:36:49.528 --> 00:36:53.611]  That guy sounded awfully young to be a CIA agent.
[00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:54.832]  He sounded younger than I am.
[00:36:55.252 --> 00:36:56.473]  Now, does that mean it's not possible?
[00:36:56.773 --> 00:36:56.954]  No.
[00:36:57.514 --> 00:36:59.375]  But I'm not going to throw my weight behind it.
[00:36:59.415 --> 00:37:00.997]  Someone just called in with some information.
[00:37:02.768 --> 00:37:03.689]  Yeah, so I gotta move on.
[00:37:04.009 --> 00:37:05.650]  Like I said, I hope you send us some information.
[00:37:05.691 --> 00:37:08.513]  If it turns out to be true, I'm sure Alex will have you on as a guest.
[00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:10.254]  Alright, let's go to Derek in Texas.
[00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:11.095]  Derek, what's on your mind?
[00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:25.687]  Jason, I was an undergrad in mechanical engineering when 9-11 happened, and I was being taught by a structural engineer who was teaching us the finite element method at UTA, and he was the first person to wake me up.
[00:37:25.747 --> 00:37:31.032]  Although it didn't fully wake me up, his comment to us was, those buildings fell way too fast
[00:37:31.553 --> 00:37:32.293]  They fell wrong.
[00:37:32.694 --> 00:37:33.754]  Everything's wrong with this.
[00:37:33.934 --> 00:37:42.139]  But we assumed our government would never ever do something like this, even though I saw stuff that, you know, probably shouldn't go on in the military while I served.
[00:37:42.679 --> 00:37:44.761]  And I'm sure other veterans can relate to that.
[00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:49.964]  Anyway, years later, I'm still asking, where are the contract plans?
[00:37:50.004 --> 00:37:56.908]  That is, the building, construction, design, architectural drawings, mechanical drawings, otherwise known as the contract documents.
[00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:57.508]  I've got them.
[00:37:59.733 --> 00:38:02.097]  Okay, now are these the South Tower ones?
[00:38:02.478 --> 00:38:03.519]  South and North Tower.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.282]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:38:05.803 --> 00:38:07.045]  Okay, where's the public place?
[00:38:07.105 --> 00:38:14.397]  Because what needs to happen here is both undergraduate and graduate engineers and lay people and whoever that know how to run finite element software
[00:38:14.778 --> 00:38:20.003]  can recreate this entire building using 3D CAD software and then run simulations.
[00:38:20.263 --> 00:38:21.144]  Well, I hope they do that.
[00:38:21.304 --> 00:38:36.577]  Dude, I think you can get them off of, if you just type in, you go to Jones' website and you look for like the PDF archives, I know that's the format they're in, is PDF, and they're pretty high res, so you should probably be able to input them into a CAD program rather easily and with the right labels.
[00:38:36.717 --> 00:38:38.299]  Like you said, construct a 3D model.
[00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:39.780]  I'm all for it.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.160]  I mean,
[00:38:41.161 --> 00:38:56.868]  I don't know if they reported it on this show, but supposedly, and this is a big supposedly, Mythbusters is finally going to do, there was a press release a few months ago, a show on 9-11 Truth, and that they are going to actually build the World Trade Center to one-third scale.
[00:38:57.148 --> 00:38:58.828]  They got a $20 million budget for the show.
[00:38:58.888 --> 00:39:01.289]  It cost $7.2 million to build these things.
[00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:06.812]  And they're going to fly remote-controlled Boeings at one-third the size into the buildings and see what happens.
[00:39:08.492 --> 00:39:09.413]  I'm anxious to see it.
[00:39:09.573 --> 00:39:20.416]  They're also, from the press release, they're anticipating that it will be the largest watched television program in the history of the United States outside of sporting events, aka the Super Bowl or the World Series.
[00:39:21.217 --> 00:39:27.139]  So, of course, I encourage all you independent researchers out there, all you engineers, to check it out.
[00:39:27.639 --> 00:39:31.520]  I'm pretty sure that they're widely available in PDF format if you know who to ask.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.762]  Stephen Jones will get back to you, architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth will get back for you.
[00:39:36.442 --> 00:39:38.002]  I'll get back to you with the files.
[00:39:38.762 --> 00:39:39.623]  Thank you for the call, Derek.
[00:39:41.323 --> 00:39:43.223]  You can never have enough independent research, folks.
[00:39:44.303 --> 00:39:54.045]  You know, there's nothing wrong with testing some of the scientific theories that the government has put out there, since none of them actually live up to scrutiny, and they constantly change.
[00:39:54.105 --> 00:39:54.685]  Well, you know what?
[00:39:54.705 --> 00:39:55.885]  I think that they pancaked.
[00:39:55.925 --> 00:39:58.706]  What happened was the sagging started to occur.
[00:39:59.366 --> 00:40:03.407]  There was 1,500 degree temperatures when we know there were 1,500 degree temperatures in there.
[00:40:04.983 --> 00:40:09.808]  It started to sag and then just one after another, pancake-a-roo, but then there were no pancakes.
[00:40:10.289 --> 00:40:20.520]  And then they said, well, what really happened is, uh, you know, it just couldn't stand the stress and they didn't actually have to melt or they just collapsed on top of themselves.
[00:40:21.501 --> 00:40:22.342]  Global collapse.
[00:40:23.919 --> 00:40:30.365]  Well, you know, I'm nowhere near the expert someone like Kevin Ryan of Underwriters Laboratory is who's done numerous papers on it.
[00:40:30.685 --> 00:40:32.446]  So I encourage people to go check that out, you know.
[00:40:32.927 --> 00:40:39.152]  Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth have really been on the front lines the past few years and I commend Richard Gage and others for what they've done.
[00:40:39.853 --> 00:40:42.215]  Alright, let's go to Mark in Canada.
[00:40:42.315 --> 00:40:43.116]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[00:40:43.136 --> 00:40:44.657]  How you doing, Jason?
[00:40:45.197 --> 00:40:45.458]  Good, man.
[00:40:46.865 --> 00:40:48.186]  I'm calling from Ottawa.
[00:40:48.366 --> 00:40:55.307]  I just wanted to let people know that we were out in force yesterday for our 11th of every month Truth Action for 9-11 Truth.
[00:40:55.347 --> 00:40:57.408]  TruthAction.org, another great organization.
[00:40:57.888 --> 00:41:01.489]  Yeah, I just actually donated $100 to TruthAction.org today.
[00:41:01.509 --> 00:41:06.030]  I didn't have it, but I did it, you know, because this was our 21st Truth Action.
[00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.811]  We've been doing it for 21 months.
[00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:15.153]  And we actually walked around downtown Ottawa yesterday, hit our four main spots that we've done over the last year.
[00:41:15.879 --> 00:41:18.881]  And did like a little recap, so there's going to be a video coming out pretty soon.
[00:41:19.541 --> 00:41:21.482]  Amazing time, beautiful weather.
[00:41:21.922 --> 00:41:24.964]  We gave out 400 DVDs with 5 movies on each DVD.
[00:41:25.664 --> 00:41:27.545]  And that's what we're doing.
[00:41:27.645 --> 00:41:38.790]  I also wanted to mention that here in Canada we were able to, the 9-11 Truthers in Ottawa, we were able to actually form an electoral district for the Canadian Action Party here.
[00:41:39.331 --> 00:41:43.373]  So I'd like to, we have an actual political party that supports 9-11 Truth.
[00:41:44.534 --> 00:41:49.579]  So I'd like to encourage the other Canadian 9-11 truth groups to form electoral districts in their area.
[00:41:51.611 --> 00:41:52.272]  That's great, man.
[00:41:52.312 --> 00:41:53.432]  That's how we can get involved.
[00:41:53.452 --> 00:42:01.277]  See, there's an organization that's been around now for just a little bit under two years and they keep expanding and they keep reinvesting in that organization.
[00:42:01.297 --> 00:42:04.119]  They realize that things aren't going to just come overnight.
[00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:04.959]  I thank you for the call.
[00:42:05.019 --> 00:42:08.922]  I mean, again, I see 9-11 Truth in the public eye.
[00:42:09.462 --> 00:42:10.563]  Again, limited hangout.
[00:42:11.223 --> 00:42:15.466]  More documents will be exposed over the next two years, but really it won't come into
[00:42:16.618 --> 00:42:20.260]  You know, the level that it did in the 5th anniversary until the 10th anniversary.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:28.564]  And that's just because of our subliminal programming where we are accustomed to 5s, 10s, 20s, 25s, 50th anniversary.
[00:42:28.764 --> 00:42:34.327]  The 10th anniversary is going to be the biggest moment for 9-11 Truth yet, if we still have a country left.
[00:42:34.747 --> 00:42:38.469]  Internationally, it is sure to be the biggest moment for 9-11 Truth, no matter what.
[00:42:38.749 --> 00:42:44.092]  But in this country, I guarantee it'll be the largest it's ever been, if we still have a country left.
[00:42:46.025 --> 00:42:46.606]  Yeah, in 2011.
[00:42:47.627 --> 00:42:48.849]  I'm hoping we have a country left.
[00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:49.109]  I don't know.
[00:42:49.129 --> 00:42:49.690]  What do you think, Jaren?
[00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:50.651]  Are we going to have a country left?
[00:42:51.212 --> 00:42:51.512]  Maybe.
[00:42:51.732 --> 00:42:52.213]  Maybe not.
[00:42:52.313 --> 00:42:54.215]  Maybe we'll just all have Pepsi with Obama symbols.
[00:42:56.118 --> 00:42:57.619]  All right, let's jump to another caller.
[00:42:57.659 --> 00:42:58.960]  Let's actually bring it up, bring it up.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:04.604]  There's the full screen cover of the whole shot of the amazing Spider-Man with Obama on it.
[00:43:04.944 --> 00:43:10.308]  So you don't get to see, you got to see Spidey and a smiling Obama, but not only do you get to see that, he's got the thumbs up.
[00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:11.568]  Obama's tops.
[00:43:11.909 --> 00:43:12.529]  Yeah.
[00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.590]  I'm number one president.
[00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:18.673]  I'm on the cover of Rolling Stone and Spider-Man and everybody loves me.
[00:43:18.873 --> 00:43:19.514]  Oprah loves me.
[00:43:19.574 --> 00:43:19.994]  Look at me.
[00:43:20.054 --> 00:43:21.215]  I'm going to save the world.
[00:43:21.895 --> 00:43:25.197]  The first global president, I think is another term that they've used for him.
[00:43:25.237 --> 00:43:25.498]  Really?
[00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:33.792]  So a state senator with one term in the Senate and then automatically boosted to president, he's the global leader?
[00:43:33.813 --> 00:43:34.935]  The guy's not even 50!
[00:43:37.457 --> 00:43:40.079]  I mean, I don't claim to have all the knowledge in the world.
[00:43:40.119 --> 00:43:46.043]  I'm not the wisest guy around, but I think I'm hip enough to know that this guy... Inauguration Day!
[00:43:46.263 --> 00:43:48.525]  The Amazing Spider-Man, number 583!
[00:43:49.125 --> 00:43:54.369]  Maybe they'll have like a number 600 issue, 17 months down the line, and another Obama commemorative.
[00:43:54.689 --> 00:43:58.272]  They'll have like the foil and the rubies on it, and you know, he can wear like a diamond hat.
[00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:02.074]  Alright, I'm getting ridiculous.
[00:44:02.174 --> 00:44:03.515]  Alright, let's go to another caller.
[00:44:03.555 --> 00:44:05.296]  Let's go to Joe in Illinois.
[00:44:05.336 --> 00:44:06.037]  Joe, what's on your mind?
[00:44:07.199 --> 00:44:08.459]  Hey, how's it going, Jason?
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.161]  Just got a quick question for you.
[00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:18.903]  I know you probably have mentioned this, I'm sure it's out there, but I really haven't heard anything about it lately.
[00:44:19.443 --> 00:44:23.624]  Barry Jennings, was it ever brought out, like, what the nature of his death was?
[00:44:23.804 --> 00:44:24.484]  Alright, yes.
[00:44:24.704 --> 00:44:26.685]  I'm glad you asked that question.
[00:44:27.925 --> 00:44:29.686]  No, I'm glad because I really want to know.
[00:44:29.706 --> 00:44:30.526]  Alright, alright.
[00:44:30.886 --> 00:44:32.747]  Just to review what happened there.
[00:44:33.808 --> 00:44:36.709]  At the end of August, there were some emails circulating around.
[00:44:36.749 --> 00:44:39.270]  We were getting emails that Barry Jennings had died.
[00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.011]  Now, I went to try to confirm this.
[00:44:42.092 --> 00:44:42.752]  I talked to Dylan.
[00:44:43.852 --> 00:44:48.694]  He got in touch with Mike Rudin of the BBC, who filmed him for that hit piece.
[00:44:48.895 --> 00:44:50.535]  Mike Rudin said, oh, I'm going to find out.
[00:44:50.575 --> 00:44:51.756]  Don't worry, there's nothing going on.
[00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:54.622]  Then on September 11th, we got out there.
[00:44:54.702 --> 00:44:57.324]  Rudin still said that, you know, everything was fine with Barry.
[00:44:57.364 --> 00:45:00.007]  He hadn't been able to get in touch with him, but he wasn't able to confirm his death.
[00:45:00.047 --> 00:45:02.909]  Well, we were able to confirm his death.
[00:45:03.249 --> 00:45:06.271]  We were able to get that same source to give us the information.
[00:45:07.152 --> 00:45:11.576]  And later on, the original source did contact us, I think, a few months ago.
[00:45:11.896 --> 00:45:17.660]  And I don't want to give away who the original source is, but he says that Barry died of leukemia, which is very possible.
[00:45:19.724 --> 00:45:25.846]  You know, whether or not this is something that he was given, maybe this is something he got sick with from being on the site of the World Trade Center.
[00:45:25.866 --> 00:45:32.468]  We all know, you know, excessive levels of chromium, barium, all these other toxic heavy metals may have done it.
[00:45:32.548 --> 00:45:38.170]  But the official cause of death, as far as anybody knows, is he died from leukemia.
[00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.590]  You know, he didn't hang himself.
[00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:40.790]  It wasn't a suicide.
[00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:48.033]  And, you know, I wanted to put that out there because the person who did tell us that, you know, they talked about the truth movement being, you know, about the truth.
[00:45:48.113 --> 00:45:49.333]  And to me, it is about the truth.
[00:45:49.733 --> 00:45:51.514]  You know, I can't tell you what happened to that man.
[00:45:51.934 --> 00:45:56.677]  I can tell you he died under suspicious circumstances, and to the best of my knowledge, it was from leukemia.
[00:45:58.057 --> 00:46:00.338]  Yeah, that's really interesting.
[00:46:00.358 --> 00:46:01.279]  I didn't know it was leukemia.
[00:46:01.299 --> 00:46:09.063]  I mean, I actually come from the medical field, and usually leukemia is a very long, drawn-out process before death.
[00:46:09.803 --> 00:46:16.587]  Now, I find that kind of interesting, depending on what kind of a leukemia it is, but you know, compared to like the one that
[00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:24.633]  A Russian KGB agent that just got... Yeah, he got sick suddenly and died.
[00:46:25.294 --> 00:46:26.174]  Right, yeah.
[00:46:26.674 --> 00:46:29.276]  And from what I understand, that's pretty much how he went.
[00:46:29.296 --> 00:46:31.517]  There was not a lot of warning.
[00:46:31.557 --> 00:46:33.838]  It wasn't something that he had battled with for a long time.
[00:46:34.118 --> 00:46:37.660]  I mean, I had really only done that interview with him a little over a year earlier.
[00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:41.793]  You know, it wasn't that he died of leukemia.
[00:46:41.813 --> 00:46:43.155]  I think it was under 18 months.
[00:46:43.735 --> 00:46:45.377]  And he didn't seem sick when I was there.
[00:46:45.397 --> 00:46:46.458]  I mean, he's a large man.
[00:46:46.879 --> 00:46:50.743]  As you know, cancer patients usually get skinny, you know, the sicker they are.
[00:46:51.303 --> 00:46:56.589]  So, again, I don't want to speculate any further, but, you know, from the best of my knowledge, it was a leukemia death.
[00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.610]  Okay.
[00:46:58.151 --> 00:46:58.491]  Very good.
[00:46:58.531 --> 00:46:59.852]  I just had one other thing to say.
[00:46:59.872 --> 00:47:04.234]  This is in regards to the caller that called from Chicago.
[00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:05.355]  I'm also in Chicago.
[00:47:05.375 --> 00:47:08.717]  And I gotta tell you, brother, you know what?
[00:47:08.817 --> 00:47:13.600]  You're in the lion's den as far as people being so pro-Obama.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:19.984]  I mean, he talks about 80% of the people in his office being African American and being the true minority.
[00:47:20.044 --> 00:47:20.865]  Well, of course.
[00:47:21.665 --> 00:47:22.186]  We all are.
[00:47:22.226 --> 00:47:32.253]  I mean, I voted for Chuck Baldwin, and even where I work at, we're an extremely liberal organization.
[00:47:32.273 --> 00:47:39.439]  I'm obviously a true conservative, and these people around here are completely snowed, just like everybody else.
[00:47:39.459 --> 00:47:46.685]  I mean, you've really got to tiptoe around, and it's very frustrating because of the fact that you want to be able to voice your opinion, but you cannot.
[00:47:48.086 --> 00:47:50.848]  Yeah, no, it is, and you know, there is a lot of social pressure.
[00:47:50.908 --> 00:48:00.193]  I mean, I've been in an office workplace before where nobody agreed with me, and in fact, you know, I'm sitting there listening to Alex Jones in my office, and people are coming in going, oh, is that Rush Limbaugh?
[00:48:00.213 --> 00:48:02.954]  And then they listen for a minute, and they know immediately it's not Rush Limbaugh.
[00:48:03.554 --> 00:48:09.598]  So you kind of have to explain your views, and you know, sometimes you're considered the kook out there, but look, the proof is in the pudding.
[00:48:09.638 --> 00:48:13.760]  I can guarantee you that people are not going to be happy, happier than they are a year from now.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.681]  It's only going to get worse, so hopefully people will wake up through that.
[00:48:16.822 --> 00:48:17.502]  I thank you for the call.
[00:48:19.715 --> 00:48:22.315]  Alright, let's jump to Lindsay in Ohio.
[00:48:22.355 --> 00:48:23.116]  Lindsay, what's on your mind?
[00:48:24.636 --> 00:48:25.377]  Hello, Jason.
[00:48:25.857 --> 00:48:26.097]  Yes.
[00:48:27.057 --> 00:48:27.897]  Good to hear from you.
[00:48:28.638 --> 00:48:29.598]  First off, I'll talk to you.
[00:48:29.618 --> 00:48:31.059]  I've talked to Alex a couple of times.
[00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:42.042]  Just a quick thing about these two, I guess mainstream would call them, incidences of these two people that were shot by the police recently.
[00:48:42.222 --> 00:48:46.004]  The one by Bart and then the undercover cops in New Orleans.
[00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:52.081]  Okay, now I've seen a lot of it on alternative sources.
[00:48:52.561 --> 00:49:00.244]  I've asked a few friends this weekend during the big games and all that, there was people there, if they saw anything on mainstream news regarding this.
[00:49:00.524 --> 00:49:01.764]  All of them said no.
[00:49:02.324 --> 00:49:06.486]  Has there been anything on mainstream about this that you know of?
[00:49:07.057 --> 00:49:13.302]  Yeah, let me see, the guy who was pinned down and shot in the chest in the subway station, yeah.
[00:49:13.762 --> 00:49:16.624]  There was a little bit of coverage on CNN's webpage.
[00:49:16.664 --> 00:49:22.148]  In fact, the day after that had happened, a bunch of people were actually wearing signs on their back that said, don't shoot me.
[00:49:22.268 --> 00:49:24.110]  They were just white pieces of paper they taped to their back.
[00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:25.631]  A lot of people in protest.
[00:49:25.691 --> 00:49:28.553]  Actually, if you type that into Google, you can easily bring that up.
[00:49:28.573 --> 00:49:31.195]  So CNN did do a couple of news reports about that.
[00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:33.197]  But what happens with those is, alright,
[00:49:33.917 --> 00:49:40.340]  You'll see those on two of CNN stations in the 24-hour news block, usually the stations that don't play a lot of the shows.
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:47.604]  In other words, it'll either be on CNN International that most people don't get, or it'll be on CNN Headline News, which isn't the main CNN station.
[00:49:48.444 --> 00:49:51.946]  And right now on PrisonPlanet.TV, we're showing you the clip.
[00:49:51.966 --> 00:49:53.667]  I mean, this guy begs for his life.
[00:49:54.227 --> 00:49:58.049]  And most of this stuff is literally local news.
[00:49:58.149 --> 00:50:00.310]  So CNN did a couple pieces about it.
[00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:03.732]  The people were very upset locally, as well they should have been.
[00:50:04.333 --> 00:50:07.315]  But you're right, this is a story that should still be in the news today.
[00:50:07.355 --> 00:50:08.876]  This should be on the front pages of paper.
[00:50:08.916 --> 00:50:11.839]  These guys should be being prosecuted and it just isn't going to happen, is it?
[00:50:11.879 --> 00:50:14.481]  These guys are going to get away with what is murder.
[00:50:14.961 --> 00:50:15.982]  It's murder.
[00:50:16.843 --> 00:50:21.206]  And the murderers need to be tried and punished accordingly.
[00:50:21.527 --> 00:50:22.548]  That's what needs to happen.
[00:50:22.588 --> 00:50:23.889]  Lindsay, I thank you for the call.
[00:50:24.209 --> 00:50:27.371]  We're going to continue to take your calls and then in the next hour we're going to have
[00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:30.633]  Matthew Medina from We Are Change San Antonio.
[00:50:30.653 --> 00:50:33.315]  It's Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.501]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:47.122]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:50:47.422 --> 00:50:49.643]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:50:50.124 --> 00:50:54.826]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:50:55.228 --> 00:50:58.069]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:51:44.045 --> 00:51:50.448]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:50.808 --> 00:51:52.789]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:53.449 --> 00:51:54.489]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:55.009 --> 00:51:55.510]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:56.710]  This is his MO.
[00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.151]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:58.191 --> 00:51:59.851]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:00.172 --> 00:52:06.914]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:07.314 --> 00:52:07.755]  Some U.S.
[00:52:07.795 --> 00:52:13.437]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:14.137 --> 00:52:17.620]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.442]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:44.267 --> 00:52:49.030]  Lead a superior life by drinking Superior Life brand ionized water.
[00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:53.312]  A couple of soft drinks each day, a few slices of pizza, last night's cheeseburgers.
[00:52:53.632 --> 00:52:59.495]  These acidic foods will make you tired, overweight, and cause numerous negative health problems in the short and long term.
[00:52:59.895 --> 00:53:06.139]  An acidic environment is created in the body, causing fuzzy memory and that all-day low energy feeling.
[00:53:06.419 --> 00:53:10.301]  These are the early signs of your body telling you that it's not getting the proper care it needs.
[00:53:10.601 --> 00:53:12.422]  We are truly a junk food nation.
[00:53:12.882 --> 00:53:21.386]  Drinking ionized water will help you drop the weight, feel better, actually become hydrated, and can improve the quality of your life.
[00:53:21.706 --> 00:53:23.186]  It's all about the pH.
[00:53:23.647 --> 00:53:25.807]  Disease cannot thrive in an alkaline body.
[00:53:26.128 --> 00:53:28.468]  What can a Life Brand Water Ionizer do for you?
[00:53:28.909 --> 00:53:29.189]  Call 800-276-9601.
[00:53:29.209 --> 00:53:29.409]  That's 800-276-9601.
[00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:35.452]  We're good to go.
[00:53:53.471 --> 00:53:58.933]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:53:58.953 --> 00:54:04.135]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[00:54:04.395 --> 00:54:06.916]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:54:07.116 --> 00:54:09.617]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:54:09.677 --> 00:54:14.958]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:54:15.199 --> 00:54:15.899]  Bum bum.
[00:54:16.579 --> 00:54:18.980]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:21.633 --> 00:54:24.494]  Beginning of the fourth and final hour coming up after this.
[00:54:25.194 --> 00:54:35.258]  Before we go back to your calls, and we're going to have Matthew Medina of We Are Change San Antonio on for about a half an hour, so if you hold on, we'll get back to your calls in the last half an hour.
[00:54:35.298 --> 00:54:40.820]  It's really been a hodgepodge of Pakistan, Biden, Obama, glowing pigs, what a day.
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.121]  What a day for the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:43.781 --> 00:54:44.682]  But none of this is really
[00:54:45.902 --> 00:54:51.087]  Possible without our sponsors and the good listeners of PrisonPlanet.TV and the people that buy our videos.
[00:54:51.147 --> 00:54:56.573]  So, you know, we hope that you go out there, you get a copy of Fabled Enemies, which I have right over here, or Truth Rising.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.761]  We're Alex Jones' endgame.
[00:54:59.742 --> 00:55:03.764]  But one of the great sponsors we have is MySolarBackup.com.
[00:55:03.784 --> 00:55:06.266]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:55:06.406 --> 00:55:07.587]  And folks, it's real simple.
[00:55:07.667 --> 00:55:08.468]  They're solar panels.
[00:55:08.588 --> 00:55:09.348]  It's solar energy.
[00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:10.629]  It cuts your bill.
[00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:12.931]  In case there's a power outage, you have power.
[00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:16.293]  You know, Jesse Ventura, he lives off the grid out in Mexico.
[00:55:16.333 --> 00:55:18.015]  Most of it is solar energy.
[00:55:19.395 --> 00:55:21.176]  It's time to get solar energy if you don't have it.
[00:55:21.196 --> 00:55:25.077]  I mean, my friends' parents have had it for years and it works great.
[00:55:25.097 --> 00:55:28.498]  It heats their pool, it heats their garage, the cool house.
[00:55:28.538 --> 00:55:31.039]  I mean, they don't spend any electricity on that at all.
[00:55:31.079 --> 00:55:34.080]  That's where me and my friends used to spend our days when we were in high school.
[00:55:35.683 --> 00:55:36.684]  The number is 1-877-327-0365.
[00:55:36.884 --> 00:55:39.925]  That's 1-877-327-0365.
[00:55:39.945 --> 00:55:46.689]  And it's MySolarBackup.com if you want to get some solar panels.
[00:55:46.889 --> 00:55:48.150]  And, you know, help us out.
[00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:49.130]  Help our sponsors.
[00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:50.371]  It's something we believe in.
[00:55:50.411 --> 00:55:51.272]  It's something that works.
[00:55:51.652 --> 00:55:53.473]  Again, you're going to cut your electricity bill.
[00:55:53.493 --> 00:55:55.114]  You're going to cut your dependents.
[00:55:55.794 --> 00:55:56.074]  Hey Jason.
[00:55:56.214 --> 00:55:56.614]  I'm doing well.
[00:55:56.754 --> 00:55:58.495]  I'm just calling to say you're doing a great job and I think
[00:56:24.804 --> 00:56:30.247]  The truth is out there and a lot of people know, but there's still a lot of people that don't know.
[00:56:30.267 --> 00:56:38.071]  And I came up with an idea of how to spread the word among people that don't really go on the internet.
[00:56:39.472 --> 00:56:44.595]  And I was thinking, and I started doing that here, but I would probably want more support.
[00:56:44.735 --> 00:56:52.479]  And that's just using their system against them, which is writing the information on the banknotes.
[00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:55.493]  And I don't know if somebody thinks it's a good idea.
[00:56:55.513 --> 00:56:57.314]  I know it's a great idea.
[00:57:01.437 --> 00:57:05.320]  You throw InfoWars.com on a $5 bill in big letters, people notice it.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.041]  You throw PrisonPlanet.com on there.
[00:57:07.341 --> 00:57:09.923]  You throw LoseChange901.com.
[00:57:10.243 --> 00:57:16.287]  All this stuff is positive because people take a look at it and even if they don't realize it, it's in their subliminal.
[00:57:16.648 --> 00:57:20.711]  They'll remember it for a moment and then if someone else introduces it to them, they're more apt to take a look.
[00:57:20.731 --> 00:57:21.071]  Continue.
[00:57:22.202 --> 00:57:32.864]  If you still have to use your money, use it and use cash and use the smallest notes and try to write or print as many as you can.
[00:57:33.965 --> 00:57:37.765]  People usually don't notice that, but after some time, like some people do.
[00:57:38.826 --> 00:57:41.846]  The other thing that interested me was the cancer you were talking about.
[00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:55.917]  I think there's a lot of truth in it, especially when you hear about people that died of cancer recently, like also Aaron Russo, Anthony Roosevelt, maybe even Jackie Kennedy.
[00:57:56.177 --> 00:57:57.338]  I'm not so sure about that.
[00:57:57.398 --> 00:58:08.086]  But you know what, I don't know whether they're injecting these guys with little, like, you know, pellet guns of ice like they had in the church committee where they showed that the CIA had these little ice guns where they could just inject somebody with poison or a disease.
[00:58:08.746 --> 00:58:13.769]  But I do know that cancer has run rampant, mainly because we put cancer viruses in our vaccines.
[00:58:13.809 --> 00:58:14.389]  They're delicious.
[00:58:14.909 --> 00:58:18.711]  All right, we'll be back at the top of the hour with Matthew Medina from We Are Change San Antonio.
[00:58:18.912 --> 00:58:19.912]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:20.012 --> 00:58:20.953]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:58:25.875 --> 00:58:28.096]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:28.497 --> 00:58:31.839]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.101]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:38.162]  A new world order.
[00:58:38.897 --> 00:58:43.301]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:43.801 --> 00:58:46.604]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:46.644 --> 00:58:48.866]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:58:49.426 --> 00:58:51.869]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:59.936]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:02.955 --> 00:59:07.918]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:08.379 --> 00:59:11.881]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:12.261 --> 00:59:14.743]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:14.823 --> 00:59:15.984]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:16.004 --> 00:59:16.764]  They're not after money.
[00:59:16.784 --> 00:59:17.865]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:18.065 --> 00:59:18.766]  They're after power.
[00:59:19.046 --> 00:59:19.906]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:59:20.187 --> 00:59:28.432]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:28.912 --> 00:59:31.294]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:31.714 --> 00:59:32.755]  You have been warned.
[00:59:36.857 --> 00:59:38.757]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:39.238 --> 00:59:41.999]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.153 --> 01:00:09.161]  Alright folks, it is the fourth and final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.204 --> 01:00:13.167]  And hopefully we have our guest on the line.
[01:00:14.588 --> 01:00:19.311]  He's somebody that's affecting change in his local area, San Antonio, about an hour away from Austin.
[01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:23.113]  And, you know, that's what's great about TruthAction.org.
[01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:25.134]  That's what's great about WeAreChange.org.
[01:00:25.174 --> 01:00:27.556]  There is no taking orders from headquarters, man.
[01:00:28.216 --> 01:00:33.719]  It's all about doing it yourself, becoming your own leader, and finding effective ways to reach others.
[01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:38.742]  So without further ado, hopefully we're going to go to Matthew Medina.
[01:00:38.762 --> 01:00:40.143]  We thank you for being on, Matthew.
[01:00:40.183 --> 01:00:41.004]  What's on your mind today?
[01:00:42.004 --> 01:00:43.005]  Hey, great to speak with you, Barron.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:45.161]  No, it's great to have you on, man.
[01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:47.822]  And why don't you tell people how you got involved.
[01:00:47.882 --> 01:00:53.265]  I mean, from your awakening to 9-11 Truth, or the Patriot movement in general, and then how you got involved.
[01:00:53.285 --> 01:00:54.125]  What was the process?
[01:00:55.225 --> 01:00:55.766]  Yeah, yes, sir.
[01:00:55.786 --> 01:01:10.013]  I started with watching the actual events of 9-11, and what would grab my attention was the footage of the dancing Palestinians, and the commentary saying that they were actually celebrating us being attacked almost within 10 minutes of the attack happening.
[01:01:10.053 --> 01:01:10.773]  I was like, what?
[01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:31.927]  So we did a little web search and found InfoWars, Road to Tyranny, and I would basically tell all my friends, all the b-boys, all the breakdancers I would know at the time, I would tell everybody about it, and it was just kind of conspiracy-ish, and I kind of let it go, I'd check InfoWars, and comes the Ron Paul revolution in San Antonio, and I joined the meetup.
[01:01:32.527 --> 01:01:39.553]  I started campaigning, going door-to-door in all my neighborhoods, basically doing the whole campaign and grassroots activities.
[01:01:40.188 --> 01:01:44.510]  And then as the campaign started to die down, I mean, I was just getting warmed up and still am to this day.
[01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:48.132]  And so it started We Are Change San Antonio at the end of the summer.
[01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:55.156]  It's been about six months and pretty much we've been busy, two or three activities a month, handing out about 500 DVDs a month.
[01:01:55.717 --> 01:02:05.842]  And with the help of Holland and Brave New Books and a lot of fellow activists that actually all pitch in and keep this group running, we've been able to reach, I would say, thousands of people already.
[01:02:05.862 --> 01:02:07.303]  We're always meeting with people on the street.
[01:02:08.087 --> 01:02:12.290]  Exactly, and you're not just armchair quarterbacks, and you're not just sitting on a forum on the internet.
[01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:18.074]  You're actually organizing, probably through the internet and, you know, through phone calls, but then you're actually grouping up.
[01:02:18.415 --> 01:02:20.476]  You're taking movies that are on the internet.
[01:02:20.496 --> 01:02:21.777]  You're burning them to DVD.
[01:02:22.017 --> 01:02:23.759]  You know, again, a lot of people don't understand.
[01:02:23.799 --> 01:02:32.485]  Yeah, we do fund this operation, in part, by our films, but we give them away for free, not only on the net, but we say, hey, if you're making copies to make other people aware, we want you to do that.
[01:02:32.525 --> 01:02:36.108]  We want you to hold screenings in libraries, in churches, in other
[01:02:36.728 --> 01:02:43.589]  Uh, places where you can hold events, so that people can get this information, so that you can turn that light on and at least get them thinking.
[01:02:43.909 --> 01:02:49.310]  You know, outside of the box, outside of this, uh, you know, paradigm of Obama or McCain.
[01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:51.251]  Obama or McCain, we were never even given a choice.
[01:02:51.331 --> 01:03:04.313]  They pushed Obama on us since, really, you know, I mean they started in 2004 and they made their decision in the primaries that he was going to be the one instead of Hillary Clinton and, you know, his whole team talks about how they expect to be president since May.
[01:03:04.853 --> 01:03:07.775]  So, you know, this is obviously a front for a larger organization.
[01:03:08.056 --> 01:03:09.377]  Who did you vote for, actually?
[01:03:10.157 --> 01:03:11.158]  I voted for Chuck Baldwin.
[01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:12.539]  I wanted to vote for McKinney.
[01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:13.660]  I know you're big on McKinney.
[01:03:14.661 --> 01:03:18.884]  So am I. Now, McKinney's a hero to me, but, you know, the Ron Paul backing...
[01:03:20.066 --> 01:03:20.967]  That doesn't hurt, does it?
[01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:23.548]  And you know what, that's what I was saying on the show yesterday.
[01:03:23.608 --> 01:03:30.652]  I was saying, you know, it would have been great to see a Ron Paul-McKinney ticket, you know, Ron Paul at the head, or even vice versa.
[01:03:30.712 --> 01:03:35.555]  Either way, I think that they could really learn from each other and work well together.
[01:03:35.575 --> 01:03:37.697]  It's just like Dennis Kucinich jumping on a ticket like that.
[01:03:37.937 --> 01:03:42.980]  Really, Kucinich has become somewhat of a superhero in the House of Representatives.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.803]  A Ron Paul-McKinney ticket would have been like Superman or Batman.
[01:03:48.363 --> 01:03:53.869]  And now you've got Kucinich saying the Federal Reserve is the Federal Express.
[01:03:53.989 --> 01:03:56.191]  I mean, a lot of people are stepping up.
[01:04:07.483 --> 01:04:08.964]  You know, and that's... Or YouTube!
[01:04:09.464 --> 01:04:16.087]  Well, yeah, YouTube, but I mean on the television, you know, and that's why we need people out there to get that to us.
[01:04:16.527 --> 01:04:25.391]  You know, I need people to record that on TiVo, transfer it to DVD, send it to, what is it, Suite 100, 3000 South Lamar, everybody knows the address.
[01:04:25.411 --> 01:04:25.911]  Send it to us!
[01:04:25.951 --> 01:04:27.052]  We need these tapes!
[01:04:27.352 --> 01:04:29.273]  We're gonna be back after this with Matthew Medina.
[01:04:29.353 --> 01:04:30.473]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:30.773 --> 01:04:32.174]  We are Change San Antonio.
[01:04:44.918 --> 01:04:48.380]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[01:04:48.741 --> 01:04:55.185]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:04:55.846 --> 01:04:56.566]  Here is why.
[01:04:57.307 --> 01:05:07.234]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[01:05:07.754 --> 01:05:10.116]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[01:05:10.476 --> 01:05:12.577]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:13.117]  this fall?
[01:05:13.578 --> 01:05:14.098]  Don't wait.
[01:05:14.418 --> 01:05:18.140]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:43.419]  Act now!
[01:05:44.339 --> 01:05:50.744]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:51.104 --> 01:05:52.766]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.761]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:55.281 --> 01:05:55.782]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:56.082 --> 01:05:57.063]  This is his M.O.
[01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:58.364]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:58.444 --> 01:06:00.106]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:00.446 --> 01:06:07.192]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:07.592 --> 01:06:08.033]  Some U.S.
[01:06:08.073 --> 01:06:13.718]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:14.418 --> 01:06:17.899]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:17.919 --> 01:06:20.720]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:06:45.054 --> 01:06:46.274]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[01:06:46.815 --> 01:06:52.996]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[01:06:53.777 --> 01:07:03.919]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.300]  Well, snap out of it.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.340]  We now have a deadline.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.341]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[01:07:08.881 --> 01:07:12.382]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press
[01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:20.207]  And pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[01:07:20.768 --> 01:07:26.470]  While I take the general of this word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:31.793]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[01:07:32.353 --> 01:07:36.115]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[01:07:36.695 --> 01:07:37.915]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:44.139 --> 01:07:49.188]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:51.833]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:55.580]  They're back!
[01:07:56.061 --> 01:08:04.865]  And you know what I forgot to plug in the first, you know, three plus hours of the show, is that Alex Jones is really giving away a piece of history on eBay.
[01:08:05.185 --> 01:08:09.287]  And it's gonna be used to help fund the InfoWar much like the Money Bomb has.
[01:08:09.907 --> 01:08:16.871]  I mean, just what you're seeing in the new office, you know, the television, it's getting a little slicker, you know, our guests look better.
[01:08:17.851 --> 01:08:20.152]  I mean, this studio is just... I'm loving it.
[01:08:20.612 --> 01:08:21.473]  I mean, it's awesome.
[01:08:21.493 --> 01:08:25.514]  It's a dream come true to be able to sub in for Alex Jones in such a quality studio.
[01:08:25.554 --> 01:08:29.696]  I mean, when I used to go down to KLBJ, in fact, I was down there yesterday.
[01:08:29.716 --> 01:08:31.116]  I was like, wow, this is a really nice studio.
[01:08:31.136 --> 01:08:31.777]  Well, guess what?
[01:08:32.037 --> 01:08:34.798]  Alex Jones' new studio blows KLBJ out of the water.
[01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:36.599]  And I love it.
[01:08:36.699 --> 01:08:37.139]  It's awesome.
[01:08:37.419 --> 01:08:38.619]  So how do we help fund this thing?
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:39.140]  Well,
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.923]  He's auctioning off Tyranny Crusher 1.
[01:08:43.644 --> 01:08:44.845]  That's Tyranny Crusher 1.
[01:08:45.025 --> 01:08:49.230]  And it is the infamous bullhorn that he used in Scanner Darkly.
[01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:56.057]  He's used to confront the Bilderberg Group and many other, you know, puppets of the elite and the elite themselves.
[01:08:56.518 --> 01:08:57.779]  So I hope you go to eBay.
[01:08:58.119 --> 01:08:59.300]  It's up to quite a bit right now.
[01:09:00.442 --> 01:09:11.175]  a serious bitters only uh... but you know whatever this goes for he is there is tyranny crusher one common that's that's awesome i tried to scam it last summer when he was here and it wasn't working on my i'll take it
[01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:21.907]  But seriously, it would be great just to put that in a big plaque, you know, put it in a piece of glass next to maybe a picture of Alex or a cover of one of his movies.
[01:09:22.548 --> 01:09:27.952]  It really makes a nice centerpiece for your den or your hockey room or your trophy collection or whatever.
[01:09:27.992 --> 01:09:30.954]  I mean, this is a real piece of history and after we win,
[01:09:31.514 --> 01:09:34.697]  I really think that, you know, this might end up in a museum someday.
[01:09:34.777 --> 01:09:45.685]  So, you know, laugh at me if you will, but Alex Jones is really on the forefront of this and he's really an inspiration for me and really got me involved at the level that I'm involved now.
[01:09:46.385 --> 01:09:49.408]  Alright, we have Matthew Medina of We Are Change San Antonio on the line.
[01:09:49.548 --> 01:09:57.514]  And why don't you tell people, Matthew, some of the actions that you're going to take in the future, what you have planned, and then how you can join the organization.
[01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:05.870]  Okay, this last Saturday, actually, we had a 9-11 Truth booth in Houston, Texas at a really big B-Boy Jam.
[01:10:05.911 --> 01:10:08.593]  That's a breakdance jam or contest, if you will.
[01:10:09.214 --> 01:10:12.497]  And it was put together by a Vicious Germs crew.
[01:10:12.778 --> 01:10:16.842]  They're a group of B-Boys, and they support 9-11 Truth and getting information on it.
[01:10:17.162 --> 01:10:21.367]  They allowed us to have a booth there, and we got out over 100 DVDs, flyers, and
[01:10:21.912 --> 01:10:26.785]  As far as future actions on January 24th in Austin, Texas.
[01:10:27.066 --> 01:10:30.435]  And if you're still around Burmins, we'd like for you and anybody from the InfoWorld
[01:10:31.021 --> 01:10:34.582]  Crew to come join us on the streets of 6th Street, downtown Austin.
[01:10:52.568 --> 01:10:54.369]  9-11 Truth, and we're bringing it there.
[01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:59.313]  I'm pleased to say that it has leaked into some pop culture that I appreciate.
[01:10:59.593 --> 01:11:00.133]  Head P.E.
[01:11:00.213 --> 01:11:07.598]  comes out with an album tomorrow, I believe, called New World Orphans, and that reaches out to the punk rock crowd.
[01:11:08.078 --> 01:11:09.920]  That's a crowd that I can relate to.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:20.607]  So many people are working so hard to get this Patriot Movement message out there, and when you're going to a concert or a B-Boy thing, you're not expecting this, but you're more prone to take a look at it, you know what I'm saying?
[01:11:21.383 --> 01:11:29.369]  Yeah, and the reason we chose January 24th on that tip, Jason, is KRS-One will be performing in Austin at 8 p.m.
[01:11:29.729 --> 01:11:30.269]  Saturday.
[01:11:30.409 --> 01:11:36.694]  And as you know, and a lot of 9-11 Truthers know, he's actually come out for 9-11 Truth and he's always been a big supporter of
[01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:40.241]  of free-thinking information flowing ever since the 80s.
[01:11:59.539 --> 01:12:02.903]  He's an icon to me and hopefully we'll get a chance to meet him.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:26.169]  And that's another thing, you know, you're not waiting for orders from Luke Radowski or the New York chapter of We Are Change, and neither is the We Are Change chapter in Colorado, or the We Are Change chapters in California.
[01:12:26.469 --> 01:12:37.218]  Everybody's doing their own thing, and it's very decentralized, and what it does is it reaches out to people on the street, people that normally wouldn't even be political, and that's why this is very encouraging to me, Matthew.
[01:12:38.239 --> 01:12:43.363]  And we also put together, I organized the San Antonio and the Fed event,
[01:12:44.516 --> 01:12:47.357]  We put that together and we worked with a lot of local activists.
[01:12:47.377 --> 01:12:57.140]  We worked with Campaign for Liberty, Austin Campaign for Liberty, John Birch Society, the local Libra magazine, we were at Change Austin, and all of us working together with a common goal.
[01:12:57.561 --> 01:13:01.562]  We put together a fantastic event, local news showed up, we got in the newspaper.
[01:13:01.582 --> 01:13:04.663]  It was really a big first time thing for the San Antonio Truth Movement.
[01:13:05.723 --> 01:13:12.264]  Exactly, and just realizing that you can have an effect and then having the will to actually do something to create that effect.
[01:13:12.564 --> 01:13:14.145]  In other words, there has to be a cause for the effect.
[01:13:14.165 --> 01:13:15.065]  You have to go out and do something.
[01:13:15.085 --> 01:13:19.726]  You can't just really think real hard and all of a sudden 9-11 truth is gonna come out worldwide.
[01:13:19.746 --> 01:13:21.126]  No, you have to take to the streets, you know?
[01:13:21.726 --> 01:13:32.748]  And movements that have been successful like, you know, the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King Jr., one of the key aspects of that, and of course this was long before the internet, but it was people out in the streets.
[01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:35.109]  And unfortunately, I have not seen
[01:13:35.769 --> 01:13:41.613]  That many people in the streets other than for anti-war protests which really just don't get to the heart of the issue.
[01:13:42.034 --> 01:13:45.256]  Here we are in a war on terror that is endless.
[01:13:45.696 --> 01:13:48.658]  We are now seven plus years into that war on terror.
[01:13:48.698 --> 01:13:52.201]  We've been in Iraq for almost six years now.
[01:13:52.481 --> 01:13:53.603]  No end in sight there.
[01:13:53.983 --> 01:13:58.650]  So obviously, there's something wrong with the approach that we're taking, saying, end the war, end the war.
[01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:59.772]  Well, why should we end the war?
[01:13:59.812 --> 01:14:04.719]  Well, because it's been based on false pretenses and on a false flag terror event.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.483]  So in order to end the war, I think it's imperative
[01:14:07.924 --> 01:14:13.646]  That we expose that fact and then hold real trials and hold people accountable for their roles in 9-11.
[01:14:13.906 --> 01:14:16.267]  Not only people, but organizations in general.
[01:14:16.507 --> 01:14:19.508]  It has to be exposed that the Israeli Mossad had a hand in 9-11.
[01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:23.590]  It has to be exposed that the Pakistani ISI had a role in 9-11.
[01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:26.211]  It has to be exposed that insiders in this country
[01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:26.591]  I don't
[01:14:43.254 --> 01:14:45.856]  Able to put their number one ideas set forth.
[01:14:45.896 --> 01:14:54.361]  And the number one idea for like two or three days was set up in an independent investigation into 9-11, reinvestigate it, and it was just completely pulled.
[01:14:54.441 --> 01:14:56.782]  Anything 9-11 related was completely pulled.
[01:14:56.802 --> 01:15:00.525]  At first they tried to, they figured, oh, it's early on, we'll just change the page.
[01:15:00.565 --> 01:15:05.107]  Instead of the front page saying 9-11 truth, we'll make them go to another page and we'll just put on the new ideas.
[01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:08.910]  But then it was still dominating all the other popular ideas.
[01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:09.570]  So what do they do?
[01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:11.951]  They just don't even, they don't even acknowledge it exists.
[01:15:11.971 --> 01:15:12.712]  They just erase it.
[01:15:16.124 --> 01:15:16.624]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:15:17.125 --> 01:15:18.866]  I mean, how do we get past that?
[01:15:18.986 --> 01:15:26.873]  I mean, obviously we've got to keep pushing forward, but I think that it's important that we expose that to people that, you know, this Obama campaign wants nothing to do with 9-11 truth.
[01:15:27.173 --> 01:15:28.575]  That the Internet is being censored.
[01:15:28.595 --> 01:15:30.436]  That Google Video will pull your video.
[01:15:30.676 --> 01:15:31.817]  They will freeze your comments.
[01:15:31.857 --> 01:15:33.018]  They will freeze your hit count.
[01:15:33.058 --> 01:15:34.199]  YouTube will do the same thing.
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:41.666]  So, I think that we have to make people aware of this subject and then circumvent them by taking a personal approach, much like the one you're doing.
[01:15:42.864 --> 01:16:11.473]  Yeah, and you would be surprised, Jason, there's something called First Friday here in San Antonio, every first Friday of the month, and it's kind of like an art scene that shows up there, art galleries, and you know, you got your trendsters, you got your older folks, it's really a mixed crowd of people, and we're always out there, and we get a lot of the responses like, oh yeah, we already know about that, and they keep walking, but we're like, well there's more to it than that, like everything you just mentioned, all the way to the Obama presidency, and that's something we're also trying to break ground on,
[01:16:12.459 --> 01:16:16.781]  We've actually, a lot of the events, we won't just hand out 9-11 info.
[01:16:17.041 --> 01:16:20.462]  Before the election we were handing out flyers that compared McCain and Obama.
[01:16:20.522 --> 01:16:22.182]  We've handed out flyers on the Federal Reserve.
[01:16:23.003 --> 01:16:27.764]  This past first Friday we were out there handing out info about Codex Alimentarius and GMO food.
[01:16:28.864 --> 01:16:31.945]  So really, I mean, we have to hit all the fronts in the info war.
[01:16:32.205 --> 01:16:33.326]  Yeah, you're running the gamut.
[01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:36.327]  You know, and that's an important thing to do.
[01:16:36.367 --> 01:16:39.648]  You know, America's freedom to fascism is one of the most effective tools out there.
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:42.846]  And it still has not been watched by the majority of Americans.
[01:16:42.906 --> 01:16:44.750]  So, that's a great video to hand out.
[01:16:45.988 --> 01:16:49.289]  Yeah, we found 100 copies of Washington You're Fired, another great flick as well.
[01:16:49.589 --> 01:16:54.450]  Yeah, you know, we carry that over at Infowars.com and Washington You're Fired is a great, great flick.
[01:16:54.470 --> 01:17:03.772]  It really, you know, when we had William Lewis on there, he said, you know, we really took the conspiracy out and just went with all these things that were just publicly in your face.
[01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:10.473]  And some of the people are telling me, oh, we think that Obama's executive orders are going to be to exonerate the Bush administration.
[01:17:11.033 --> 01:17:21.039]  Well, I think the Bush administration exonerated themselves with the Military Commissions Act when they said that nobody in the administration could be prosecuted on any war crimes from September 11, 2001 on.
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:26.282]  So, I don't think that Obama even needs to do that.
[01:17:26.302 --> 01:17:35.127]  I think that what we're going to see is a massive re-regulation of the economy, whether that be an Amaro or some other type of system.
[01:17:35.367 --> 01:17:36.828]  I think we're going to see banks go under.
[01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:41.130]  Tarpley has really talked about the New New Deal.
[01:17:41.771 --> 01:17:48.914]  And in my town, you know, the little high school town I grew up in, you could see the Works Progress Administration signs.
[01:17:48.954 --> 01:17:56.998]  And people who don't know what the Works Progress Administration is, it's what Roosevelt set up to give state jobs and federal jobs to people that had nothing.
[01:17:57.518 --> 01:17:58.939]  And they built some infrastructure.
[01:17:59.379 --> 01:18:01.440]  And I mean, that infrastructure lasted a long time.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.901]  I mean, my sidewalks still have that.
[01:18:02.921 --> 01:18:05.522]  So I think you're going to see those type of programs brought back.
[01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:10.586]  Where people will be working on roads and railways because there will be nothing else.
[01:18:11.567 --> 01:18:13.749]  Or building toll roads.
[01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:24.678]  You're right, it'll probably be more infrastructure for the Securities and Prosperities Partnership which Vicente Fox said isn't going as fast as he would like.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:31.103]  That's actually another front on the info war we need to get out on the streets and
[01:18:31.656 --> 01:18:39.161]  A lot of people see it here in Texas, but we want to show them how they can take action and we can have local victories in this fight.
[01:18:39.642 --> 01:18:40.562]  What's the website?
[01:18:43.024 --> 01:18:52.370]  Our meetup is on, the URL is sanantoniotruth.org and that links to our meetup.
[01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:56.553]  Anyone in Austin can go to meetup.com slash wearechangeaustin as well.
[01:18:59.798 --> 01:19:01.579]  YouTube.com slash WeAreChangeSA.
[01:19:01.679 --> 01:19:04.381]  And I'll ask everyone to subscribe to the videos.
[01:19:04.801 --> 01:19:10.825]  We're going to have a montage video of us at the B-Boy Jam in Houston with the 9-11 Truth Booth.
[01:19:11.125 --> 01:19:13.347]  And we're working together with HoustonTruth.org.
[01:19:14.147 --> 01:19:16.008]  Eddie, Dickie, Chase, and Ben from Houston.
[01:19:16.048 --> 01:19:18.790]  And we'll have that video on the YouTube page tonight, hopefully.
[01:19:19.951 --> 01:19:20.771]  Sounds good to me.
[01:19:20.831 --> 01:19:24.514]  And remember, no matter where you are, whether you're in a different country,
[01:19:25.523 --> 01:19:26.323]  You're in a different state.
[01:19:27.104 --> 01:19:31.205]  You can start your own chapter of We Are Change, or you can join a chapter of WeAreChange.org.
[01:19:31.805 --> 01:19:32.726]  We've got Matthew Medina.
[01:19:32.746 --> 01:19:33.206]  We'll be back.
[01:19:33.226 --> 01:19:34.806]  We're going to take your phone calls after this.
[01:19:35.206 --> 01:19:36.267]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:48.251]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:54.283]  I don't think so.
[01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:15.290]  We're good to go!
[01:20:43.982 --> 01:20:46.003]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:20:46.143 --> 01:20:48.525]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:20:48.545 --> 01:20:50.666]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:20:50.806 --> 01:20:52.347]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:20:52.367 --> 01:20:54.008]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:20:54.108 --> 01:20:56.930]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:20:56.970 --> 01:21:00.612]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:21:10.284 --> 01:21:15.073]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:21:15.154 --> 01:21:16.256]  An inside job.
[01:21:18.932 --> 01:21:19.993]  How dare you!
[01:21:20.433 --> 01:21:26.416]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:21:26.436 --> 01:21:29.237]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:21:29.337 --> 01:21:35.760]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.362]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:21:38.642 --> 01:21:40.643]  Or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:21:40.903 --> 01:21:43.424]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:21:45.645 --> 01:21:46.746]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:47.199 --> 01:21:52.662]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:53.742]  That's right.
[01:21:54.062 --> 01:21:56.343]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:56.904 --> 01:22:03.867]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:22:04.407 --> 01:22:10.070]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs.
[01:22:10.546 --> 01:22:12.067]  Get no word about IRAs.
[01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:17.389]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:22:18.009 --> 01:22:23.012]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:23.812 --> 01:22:27.934]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:22:28.334 --> 01:22:28.594]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:28.614 --> 01:22:30.515]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:22:30.595 --> 01:22:30.895]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:31.195 --> 01:22:31.475]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:39.906 --> 01:22:39.966]  2-2-3-7.
[01:22:58.746 --> 01:22:59.066]  We're good to go!
[01:23:27.398 --> 01:23:28.038]  We're good to go.
[01:23:57.711 --> 01:24:12.544]  I don't know any whiskey drinking Indians, but then again, I don't know many Indians at all, because we wipe most of them out.
[01:24:21.095 --> 01:24:24.257]  And that's why we had Russell Means on last week from the Lakota Tribe.
[01:24:24.637 --> 01:24:29.581]  Pretty interesting how they're trying to set up their own bank where they only accept silver and gold as currency.
[01:24:30.721 --> 01:24:32.002]  That's genius to me.
[01:24:32.723 --> 01:24:37.025]  With this economy, hard assets seem to be the only thing that we're going to have.
[01:24:38.146 --> 01:24:39.867]  Like I said, I don't know how they're going to restructure it.
[01:24:40.368 --> 01:24:44.871]  I do know that that's going to retain value and that fiat currency is eventually going to fall.
[01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:52.217]  And, you know, Matthew Medina of We Are Change San Antonio, that's one of the big issues and that's why you did the End the Fed Rally, correct?
[01:24:54.665 --> 01:24:59.248]  I mean, again, there's so many ways to get involved, and this is such a multi-faceted issue.
[01:24:59.568 --> 01:25:09.735]  I find, you know, again, you're going to a B-Boy concert, so you go there with five or ten members of We Are Change, I think that those people need to relate to, you know, people that they think that they can, you know, talk to.
[01:25:09.815 --> 01:25:21.222]  Someone they start a conversation up with on something totally and completely unrelated, and then work your way into 9-11 truth, or work your way into the truth about the Federal Reserve, or work your way into the truth about the bailout.
[01:25:22.571 --> 01:25:25.933]  Well, which is easy to do because it actually does affect our everyday life.
[01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:27.094]  Absolutely.
[01:25:27.434 --> 01:25:28.275]  Let's take some calls.
[01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:31.957]  Hopefully we still have Rudger in Idaho.
[01:25:32.017 --> 01:25:32.998]  Rudger, what's on your mind?
[01:25:34.559 --> 01:25:34.999]  Hello!
[01:25:35.659 --> 01:25:36.240]  How are you, sir?
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:39.502]  Hi, this is Albert Schweitzer, I presume?
[01:25:39.762 --> 01:25:41.583]  No, it's Jason, that's right.
[01:25:42.043 --> 01:25:45.506]  I was surprised my telephone number's not blocked.
[01:25:45.606 --> 01:25:50.309]  I'm blocked from making posts on InfoWars.com.
[01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:52.030]  I, myself,
[01:25:52.401 --> 01:25:55.403]  I voted for Jesus Christ.
[01:25:55.563 --> 01:26:03.027]  I wrote that and I think I'm going to go where white men fear to tread here.
[01:26:03.367 --> 01:26:11.492]  We have Michael Collins Piper on to discuss the JFK assassination, author of the book Final Judgment.
[01:26:15.419 --> 01:26:18.662]  I don't know, I don't book the guests, but you seem pretty adversarial.
[01:26:19.282 --> 01:26:20.263]  Let's cut him off.
[01:26:20.323 --> 01:26:25.207]  First of all, he started out with the comment that we don't let you post on InfoWars.
[01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:28.289]  That's correct.
[01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:35.896]  The only reason that you wouldn't be able to post for InfoWars is if you were putting racist comments continuously and they had to block your IP.
[01:26:36.736 --> 01:26:40.377]  Or if you were threatening people with violence and they had to block your IP.
[01:26:40.637 --> 01:26:41.457]  It's an open forum.
[01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:42.978]  No one screens your phone call here.
[01:26:43.018 --> 01:26:44.838]  They ask you what your name is and where you're from.
[01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:46.038]  I know John Harmon.
[01:26:46.298 --> 01:26:47.199]  I know how it works here.
[01:26:47.779 --> 01:26:48.439]  I know Jaren.
[01:26:48.459 --> 01:26:50.179]  They don't go, OK, what do you want to talk about?
[01:26:50.259 --> 01:26:51.460]  Oh, you can't talk about that.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.060]  You talk about anything you want on here.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.601]  I've met Michael Collins Piper on several occasions.
[01:26:56.361 --> 01:26:57.641]  I've spoken at events with him.
[01:26:58.361 --> 01:27:02.402]  We actually had a pretty good conversation after I previewed.
[01:27:03.462 --> 01:27:05.803]  This was long before Fabled Enemies was even
[01:27:06.283 --> 01:27:28.230]  You know, anything other than an idea of mine, but about probably 8 to 12 months before I put it out, I had basically done a lecture on the international aspiring, the Pakistanis, the Israeli connection to 9-11, and we had a long talk after that and he apologized for the way that, you know, American Free Press had slandered, you know, myself and others in the 9-11 truth movement as some kind of operatives.
[01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:30.330]  You know, that's why it gets so ridiculous, man.
[01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:36.152]  I have to sit here and defend myself from, you know, Jason Burmess is Israeli Mossad, Jason Burmess is a shape-shifting
[01:27:36.172 --> 01:27:38.513]  Yeah, and we see a lot of this going on in the movement.
[01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:45.157]  People are provocateering and then they turn their behavior and act innocent.
[01:27:45.197 --> 01:27:48.259]  Like we saw Robert Wannick dealing with a situation that he made a video about.
[01:27:48.279 --> 01:27:49.380]  When people show their fruits and
[01:28:06.403 --> 01:28:08.172]  I reveal I'm supposed to be in this kind of...
[01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:14.312]  And did you notice how this guy said white man?
[01:28:15.633 --> 01:28:17.594]  Listen brother, we're all human beings.
[01:28:17.634 --> 01:28:23.056]  I hate to tell ya, if somebody's got a little extra tone on their skin, it doesn't mean he's not a human being.
[01:28:23.196 --> 01:28:23.716]  White man?
[01:28:24.057 --> 01:28:25.717]  No, we're human beings.
[01:28:26.158 --> 01:28:36.022]  And it sucks because racist sites like Stormfront and all that, sometimes linked to Infowars and PrisonPlanet.com, and they try to associate themselves with us.
[01:28:36.062 --> 01:28:38.083]  Look, we're not a racist organization, man.
[01:28:38.723 --> 01:28:38.983]  Alright?
[01:28:39.203 --> 01:28:39.683]  I'm sorry.
[01:28:39.743 --> 01:28:41.164]  I don't hate the Jews.
[01:28:41.224 --> 01:28:42.384]  I don't hate the blacks.
[01:28:43.024 --> 01:28:45.005]  You know, I'm not going to call people ragheads.
[01:28:45.525 --> 01:28:48.406]  I mean, it's just all about dehumanization.
[01:28:48.786 --> 01:28:49.866]  It's ridiculous, man.
[01:28:51.087 --> 01:28:52.227]  That call pissed me off.
[01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:52.907]  It really did.
[01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:56.608]  And then he tries to incorporate himself with Jesus Christ.
[01:28:56.908 --> 01:28:59.389]  Like Jesus is bringing forth the racist word.
[01:28:59.789 --> 01:29:00.889]  And we're censoring him.
[01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:02.050]  When are you going to have this guy?
[01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.410]  Come on.
[01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:03.110]  Give me a break, man.
[01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:08.411]  If you really think that one race or religion rules the world, you're absolutely and completely lost.
[01:29:08.751 --> 01:29:10.591]  Matthew, finish it up for us in the next 30 seconds.
[01:29:12.112 --> 01:29:26.054]  Okay, uh, just go to YouTube, check out our YouTube account, we are ChangeSA, and hopefully it'll inspire you, show your brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, it's the youth taking action, and we can do it in a cool, hip, fun way, and it's fantastic, spreadin' truth.
[01:29:26.594 --> 01:29:30.235]  Alright, thank you so much for coming on, it's InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:34.335 --> 01:29:35.255]  We're on the march.
[01:29:35.715 --> 01:29:37.316]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:37.336 --> 01:29:41.036]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:44.557 --> 01:29:47.938]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:48.078 --> 01:29:53.299]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:29:53.479 --> 01:29:58.260]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:29:58.620 --> 01:29:59.300]  The KDF
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:09.785]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[01:30:10.145 --> 01:30:15.688]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:30:15.928 --> 01:30:21.991]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:22.191 --> 01:30:22.851]  What about you?
[01:30:23.231 --> 01:30:27.213]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:30:29.634 --> 01:30:32.716]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[01:30:34.457 --> 01:30:36.478]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[01:30:38.939 --> 01:30:42.461]  Or simply click on the banner at GCNlive.com to order online now.
[01:30:44.042 --> 01:30:50.386]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:50.746 --> 01:30:52.407]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:53.562 --> 01:30:54.402]  Who is the enemy?
[01:30:54.923 --> 01:30:55.423]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:55.723 --> 01:30:56.703]  This is his M.O.
[01:30:56.723 --> 01:30:58.064]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:58.084 --> 01:30:59.704]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:00.084 --> 01:31:06.827]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:07.227 --> 01:31:07.667]  Some U.S.
[01:31:07.707 --> 01:31:13.389]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:14.049 --> 01:31:17.552]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:19.553]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:44.008 --> 01:31:47.271]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:31:47.451 --> 01:31:51.534]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:31:51.714 --> 01:31:59.681]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:31:59.941 --> 01:32:00.381]  We're good to go!
[01:32:33.209 --> 01:32:33.729]  That's right.
[01:32:57.503 --> 01:33:04.954]  It's the Alex Jones Show, I am Jason Burmess and Alex is on vacation for the week with his family, a much deserved vacation.
[01:33:05.896 --> 01:33:10.923]  And we're going to keep taking your calls, but before we go to the next call, I really want to address Rudger.
[01:33:11.730 --> 01:33:12.090]  Okay.
[01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:18.052]  The ignorant things that were spouted out of his mouth were something out of the Boondocks cartoon.
[01:33:18.072 --> 01:33:19.012]  And I have the picture up.
[01:33:19.072 --> 01:33:22.493]  I mean, this guy is basically a white version of Uncle Ruckus.
[01:33:23.214 --> 01:33:30.376]  I don't know if you guys actually watch the show, but they have the self-loathing black guy over there who's making racist comment after racist comment.
[01:33:30.936 --> 01:33:32.796]  And of course, you know, they're the bad guy.
[01:33:33.197 --> 01:33:36.658]  I mean, this guy is basically the white Uncle Ruckus.
[01:33:36.678 --> 01:33:37.558]  Look, get over it, man.
[01:33:38.238 --> 01:33:39.219]  We're human beings.
[01:33:39.259 --> 01:33:42.161]  I mean, Uncle Ruckus praises white Jesus, too.
[01:33:42.201 --> 01:33:43.682]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:33:43.702 --> 01:33:44.882]  There is no white Jesus.
[01:33:44.942 --> 01:33:50.866]  If you actually believed in Christianity and the Word of God, you know, a human being is a human being, my man.
[01:33:51.667 --> 01:33:53.328]  But you wouldn't understand that because
[01:33:54.278 --> 01:34:04.961]  You know, you've been fed with all these crazy ideas that anybody outside of, you know, the white Anglo-American lifestyle or race is out to get you and is inferior for some reason.
[01:34:06.281 --> 01:34:07.582]  I never get the racist, man.
[01:34:07.962 --> 01:34:09.842]  I feel like Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:34:09.882 --> 01:34:10.522]  was correct.
[01:34:10.602 --> 01:34:16.024]  You judge a person not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
[01:34:16.764 --> 01:34:21.085]  Imagine that the content of their character, you judge somebody based on what they do in life.
[01:34:21.305 --> 01:34:21.485]  Hmm.
[01:34:21.846 --> 01:34:22.746]  How they treat people.
[01:34:22.966 --> 01:34:23.126]  Wow.
[01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:25.072]  Not what they look like, really?
[01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:38.000]  We're going to get past that whole superficial... I know, I know they might be wearing some cool hipster clothes or a nice shiny uniform that you're supposed to, you know, bow down and obey to, but uh... I don't think it should really matter what color they are.
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:45.445]  You know, maybe that's a lie that people fell for back in the thirties when uh... the Nazis came to power and it was kill everybody.
[01:34:45.465 --> 01:34:48.267]  You know, because they killed white people too, just like the communists did.
[01:34:48.287 --> 01:34:52.930]  You know, they killed a bunch of gypsies, uh... homosexuals, they killed uh...
[01:34:53.937 --> 01:34:58.678]  People that they felt were not up to par, in other words, you know, the mentally ill.
[01:35:00.359 --> 01:35:01.579]  People with Down Syndrome.
[01:35:01.819 --> 01:35:03.600]  They killed white people too, you know.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.501]  Basically, when they start killing people en masse like that, it's not just killing other races.
[01:35:07.801 --> 01:35:10.042]  They get you to hate those races and then you die too.
[01:35:10.062 --> 01:35:13.723]  Because it's really all about them killing everybody but themselves.
[01:35:14.643 --> 01:35:17.504]  But again, you don't get that because you're a racist moron.
[01:35:18.735 --> 01:35:23.696]  But that's live radio and, you know, Alex isn't here, so I'm sure you can call in right now and savagely attack me if you'd like.
[01:35:24.496 --> 01:35:28.617]  Alright, let's go to Frank in Boston.
[01:35:28.737 --> 01:35:29.818]  Frank, what's on your mind?
[01:35:30.998 --> 01:35:32.738]  Yes, thank you, Jason.
[01:35:32.778 --> 01:35:33.238]  How are you?
[01:35:33.579 --> 01:35:33.859]  Good, man.
[01:35:33.879 --> 01:35:34.339]  How are you doing?
[01:35:34.919 --> 01:35:35.239]  Pretty good.
[01:35:35.279 --> 01:35:41.920]  Well, first of all, I'm a prideful truther, and I don't know any other way to... I can't prove that to you.
[01:35:42.181 --> 01:35:43.881]  I've been accused of being a provocateur.
[01:35:44.161 --> 01:35:45.961]  I'll be honest with you, and I hate that.
[01:35:46.482 --> 01:35:48.142]  I'm a graduate of the University of Notre Dame.
[01:35:48.712 --> 01:35:59.161]  I discovered the Truth Movement through Eric Humschmid's videos, and also then got turned on to the whole Building 7 thing, and then found Alex Jones, and then the rest is history.
[01:35:59.281 --> 01:36:01.823]  So for three or four years I've been involved in the movement.
[01:36:03.485 --> 01:36:06.828]  I'm in Rhode Island, so I'm aware of our We Are Change chapter here in Rhode Island.
[01:36:07.248 --> 01:36:09.330]  I've talked to Luke several times, whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:15.475]  I am not a provocateur, but I do have very critical opinions
[01:36:15.914 --> 01:36:22.781]  About where this movement has come from and where it has gone and where it seems to be not going at this point.
[01:36:24.083 --> 01:36:30.330]  You asked a question earlier, and I can't remember every word specifically you said, but your question was how do we get past this?
[01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:35.235]  I think you were referencing the idea that we can educate as many people as we can.
[01:36:35.734 --> 01:36:39.657]  But how do we get that message into a place of motivation?
[01:36:39.837 --> 01:36:42.659]  How do we get it so that people are mobilized in the streets?
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:44.321]  So that we have numbers in the streets?
[01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:45.281]  Okay, continue.
[01:36:45.982 --> 01:36:48.304]  Okay, that is a very good question.
[01:36:48.684 --> 01:36:52.207]  And I do think it goes to the point of where my critique is.
[01:36:53.027 --> 01:36:57.411]  We can't, I hate to even use the term mainstream media, because
[01:36:57.992 --> 01:37:05.497]  I don't really, I think it turns it too much into this big monster that is unidentifiable and unrecognizable.
[01:37:06.597 --> 01:37:07.318]  It's not the case.
[01:37:07.658 --> 01:37:13.862]  I mean, the mainstream media is made up of specific institutions and it's made up of specific people and specific roles.
[01:37:14.462 --> 01:37:24.308]  And I think that to just kind of throw our hands up in the air or, and again, I'm not saying this is what everybody's doing, but to come to some convenient cop-out that
[01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:31.955]  Oh, you know, the way for this movement forward is really just this home, this organic process of one by one, everyone waking up.
[01:37:32.275 --> 01:37:34.137]  You know, I understand the value of that.
[01:37:34.237 --> 01:37:35.738]  Hey, that's how I got on board.
[01:37:36.098 --> 01:37:38.280]  But like, like, that's how I got on board.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:38.900]  It just happened.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:42.503]  I looked at someone's website and they showed Building 7 going down.
[01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.264]  And then I did a little more research, blah, blah, blah.
[01:37:44.464 --> 01:37:48.807]  So I came on board through that, through that organic process.
[01:37:49.407 --> 01:37:52.029]  But why are we restricted by that?
[01:37:52.269 --> 01:37:54.311]  I mean, everything that happens
[01:37:54.844 --> 01:37:55.766]  It's a great show.
[01:38:05.461 --> 01:38:22.791]  Well, we can make believe it's not there and just sit back and just... I'm just wondering what paradigm you think that we can reach the most people, because, you know, like I was telling, uh, you know, me and Rob were having a discussion the other day of, you know, the power and influence of TV and how TV has really been their tool to dumb us down, but I said, well, you know, that's just it.
[01:38:22.831 --> 01:38:24.532]  It is just another tool, just like a hammer.
[01:38:24.552 --> 01:38:31.056]  You know, I can use a hammer to go and fix my house, um, you know, build a shed, or I can go and use it to bash my neighbor's head in.
[01:38:31.376 --> 01:38:32.577]  You know, that's a tool.
[01:38:33.117 --> 01:38:34.678]  That's a great, that's a great, uh,
[01:38:35.086 --> 01:38:44.908]  That's a great symbolism there, but what I would say is, look, I don't think the paradigm or the way to address the paradigm is wrapped up in having to articulate every nuance of it.
[01:38:45.288 --> 01:38:45.788]  Okay.
[01:38:45.948 --> 01:38:58.731]  Here's the reality, is that when you claim that 3,000 people were murdered on 9-11, which I buy into that, I buy into that, and they were murdered by, not the 19 terrorists, but by elements
[01:38:59.161 --> 01:39:02.722]  That are unseen within our government or whatever, or corporate structure, or domestically.
[01:39:02.742 --> 01:39:05.283]  Yeah, I believe that there is a conspiracy there.
[01:39:05.723 --> 01:39:11.305]  When you believe that, you either act like that, that you believe that, or you don't act like you believe that.
[01:39:11.565 --> 01:39:19.168]  And I would say the one thing that the average American is smart enough to know is whether someone's being consistent with what they say and what they do.
[01:39:19.708 --> 01:39:27.471]  And in this movement right now, with all due respect to all my fellow truthers, I do not believe, and I'll plead guilty to this as well,
[01:39:28.064 --> 01:39:30.887]  I'm not pointing fingers but I do not think we are.
[01:39:43.188 --> 01:39:44.769]  You might say to me, what should we do then?
[01:40:00.367 --> 01:40:02.028]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:02.209 --> 01:40:04.731]  I mentioned that punk rock band, Head P.E.
[01:40:04.751 --> 01:40:09.835]  They're putting out albums trying to reach the youth that are just there, usually to mosh and have a good time.
[01:40:09.855 --> 01:40:11.096]  They're not really into the politics.
[01:40:11.357 --> 01:40:17.322]  So people are slipping it into other aspects of life, but I don't think enough people are doing that.
[01:40:17.362 --> 01:40:18.163]  Continue, Frank.
[01:40:18.423 --> 01:40:20.625]  If you think you have a solution, we're all ears here.
[01:40:21.374 --> 01:40:25.517]  I think it makes a lot of sense to cater your invitation to awakening to the people you're talking to.
[01:40:25.537 --> 01:40:26.377]  I agree with that.
[01:40:26.618 --> 01:40:26.798]  Yeah.
[01:40:26.958 --> 01:40:50.554]  But I think that there's this underlying current in this movement, and again, I'm not a provocateur calling for violence against people or anything like that, but there is this undercurrent of passivity or pacifist nature to this movement, which if someone could make a collusive argument how that actually serves the justice in the accounting
[01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:53.211]  For what we believe has been done, I'm all ears.
[01:40:53.492 --> 01:40:59.655]  But Jesus, again, I don't want to turn this into religion, but I'm not saying Jesus Christ, I'm saying Jesus as a person.
[01:41:00.476 --> 01:41:06.860]  He ended up being murdered by the system that he spoke passively about, okay?
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:11.803]  We either are going to be martyrs, or we're going to go out there and we're going to actually... How can I put this?
[01:41:12.443 --> 01:41:12.923]  I don't know.
[01:41:30.026 --> 01:41:30.286]  Front.
[01:41:30.426 --> 01:41:33.089]  I mean, because I am not an anarchist.
[01:41:50.865 --> 01:42:15.372]  all the answers I will say this though I don't think that you know you talked about either we're gonna be martyrs or you're not sure and yeah I mean unfortunately I do think that's it I don't think that we can win an armed battle I'm pro second amendment but you do there's no way we're gonna go on the streets these guys have sound weapons they've got a tasers that are shot wirelessly 30 feet from a shotgun you know I mean they can hit you with a satellite at the drones they use
[01:42:16.345 --> 01:42:18.427]  You know what, I just watched Eagle Eye a couple weeks ago.
[01:42:18.447 --> 01:42:20.469]  It really speaks to the Big Brother surveillance state.
[01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:26.194]  You know, it's probably an extension of Enemy of the State that was out in the 90s.
[01:42:26.234 --> 01:42:30.158]  And I talk in films because that's what the general populace can relate to.
[01:42:30.418 --> 01:42:31.679]  Oh, I saw that movie in the theater.
[01:42:31.699 --> 01:42:32.940]  Oh, we're getting that on DVD.
[01:42:33.181 --> 01:42:34.502]  But that technology is there.
[01:42:34.582 --> 01:42:39.787]  So I don't know how, you know, maybe in rural areas, but even rural areas, if they send in troops
[01:42:40.307 --> 01:42:43.229]  You know, you've got a shotgun, they've got an automatic rifle.
[01:42:44.210 --> 01:42:46.371]  You've got no armor, they're wearing dragon skin.
[01:42:46.931 --> 01:43:02.762]  So, I don't know how any kind of an armed revolution is going to help this movement in any way, shape, or form, other than to demonize us, much like they demonized the militia movement of, you know, the early 80s into the early 90s when they blamed Timothy McVeigh for Oklahoma City.
[01:43:02.802 --> 01:43:09.687]  It's very easy to sway the public opinion of the sheeple out there when they have a tool like television and, you know,
[01:43:10.767 --> 01:43:13.088]  They control 95% of that television.
[01:43:13.108 --> 01:43:14.248]  It's very hard to combat that.
[01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:15.488]  I mean, it's not impossible.
[01:43:15.528 --> 01:43:16.268]  That's why I'm here.
[01:43:16.328 --> 01:43:17.128]  That's why you're here.
[01:43:17.588 --> 01:43:19.809]  And we do have to figure ways out around it.
[01:43:19.829 --> 01:43:21.369]  I don't think you're a provocateur.
[01:43:21.409 --> 01:43:26.270]  I think that you just strongly believe that we do need to change and try to reach more people.
[01:43:26.850 --> 01:43:32.351]  Alright, let's go to Ronnie in Los Angeles, and then we're going to go to Scott in Pennsylvania, the first-time caller.
[01:43:32.391 --> 01:43:33.231]  Ronnie, what's on your mind?
[01:43:33.891 --> 01:43:35.192]  Hey, what's going on, Jason?
[01:43:35.232 --> 01:43:37.692]  First off, I want to thank you for your work.
[01:43:39.657 --> 01:43:41.978]  And everyone out there, you know, actually doing something.
[01:43:44.779 --> 01:43:49.080]  I'm calling mainly about the Israel-Palestine conflict.
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:49.960]  Sure.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:44:03.503]  There's this one scholar, he's the most prominent scholar I've seen so far that's, you know, well over-informed about the situation, and his name is Norman Finkelstein.
[01:44:04.143 --> 01:44:04.703]  Have you heard of him?
[01:44:05.264 --> 01:44:05.364]  No.
[01:44:07.475 --> 01:44:10.736]  I was wondering if maybe I could suggest that you guys get him on the show.
[01:44:12.236 --> 01:44:26.839]  He's written books like The Holocaust Industry, Israel-Palestine Conflict, and he's been banned from Israel through pressure from AIPAC and other powerful Jewish entities.
[01:44:26.879 --> 01:44:34.320]  He's actually Jewish, and he's the son of two Holocaust survivors, and I'm Palestinian,
[01:44:35.126 --> 01:44:40.617]  And, uh, you know, I'm a Muslim, and, you know, I don't buy into this whole, you know, it's all about religion.
[01:44:40.957 --> 01:44:42.220]  It's not about religion.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:45.686]  You know, there's wrong and right, and there's legal and illegal.
[01:44:47.213 --> 01:45:03.665]  Well, I mean, if you just look at, you know, Ron Paul, and I thank you for the call, on the House floor, describing how, you know, Israelis are the ones that created Hamas in the first place, created their enemy, radicalized their enemy, so that they could continue to fight them and expand their presence in Gaza.
[01:45:03.945 --> 01:45:13.172]  You know, when Cynthia McKinney goes there last week on a peace mission to try to give aid to the Palestinians, her boat is rammed by an Israeli ship.
[01:45:13.712 --> 01:45:17.035]  So yeah, there's a lot going on there outside of religion.
[01:45:17.555 --> 01:45:18.616]  Religion is the cover.
[01:45:19.056 --> 01:45:20.117]  Religion is the front.
[01:45:20.958 --> 01:45:22.779]  We all know what the elite's religion is.
[01:45:22.819 --> 01:45:25.301]  It's paganism, it's occultism, it's luciferianism.
[01:45:25.762 --> 01:45:26.842]  It's different sects of that.
[01:45:27.523 --> 01:45:33.748]  Yeah, yeah, your Christian conservative leaders like to meet in the woods and do mock human sacrifices to a big owl god.
[01:45:35.762 --> 01:45:37.203]  I mean, most of you know that if you're listening.
[01:45:37.323 --> 01:45:38.784]  If you don't know it, challenge me on it.
[01:45:39.064 --> 01:45:40.925]  Hey, I mean, you can watch The Ritual on Google.
[01:45:41.325 --> 01:45:41.986]  It's the real deal.
[01:45:42.006 --> 01:45:44.568]  You can see the pictures from their own internal annals.
[01:45:45.328 --> 01:45:52.893]  You can find out that it is the elite, that the Bush family's been involved for years, you know, that the Hearst family's been there, that Kissinger's there.
[01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:59.137]  Oh, by the way, they hatched the Manhattan Project, you know, that nuclear program at the Bohemian Grove.
[01:45:59.577 --> 01:46:03.639]  Oppenheimer, all those guys at the Bohemian Club, and they discussed it, and they're like, yeah, you know, let's...
[01:46:04.773 --> 01:46:06.334]  Let's build a nuclear technology.
[01:46:06.735 --> 01:46:09.857]  And it wasn't in some kind of a public forum, you know.
[01:46:10.218 --> 01:46:13.020]  It was at the Bohemian Grove, these secret societies.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:16.823]  It's really, you know, the first step in intelligence organizations.
[01:46:16.923 --> 01:46:17.484]  That's what they are.
[01:46:18.985 --> 01:46:21.968]  All right, let's go to our first-time caller, Scott in Pennsylvania.
[01:46:21.988 --> 01:46:22.788]  Scott, what's on your mind?
[01:46:22.808 --> 01:46:25.811]  Hi, Jason.
[01:46:25.871 --> 01:46:26.391]  Great job.
[01:46:26.852 --> 01:46:27.272]  Thank you.
[01:46:27.833 --> 01:46:30.455]  I had four quick points that I just wanted to talk about.
[01:46:31.102 --> 01:46:36.946]  One was, has anybody thought that Powell's talking about lies like he did about the WMDs?
[01:46:38.146 --> 01:46:46.751]  The second point is, this past Sunday there was a bill passed by the Senate to give 2 million acres to the Agenda 21 program.
[01:46:47.592 --> 01:46:57.798]  And the third point is, everybody should sign up for a campaign for Liberty.com if they want to have some change in their local politics.
[01:46:58.681 --> 01:47:05.283]  And the fourth item was the Lakota Bank isn't endorsed by Russell Means.
[01:47:05.783 --> 01:47:12.505]  I've heard a couple people talk about it on your show, but as far as I know, it hasn't been endorsed by him.
[01:47:13.306 --> 01:47:17.787]  Go over the Agenda 21 thing for me because I'm not quite sure what that means.
[01:47:18.007 --> 01:47:18.827]  I'm not familiar with it.
[01:47:19.227 --> 01:47:23.449]  Okay, Agenda 21 is a program by the UN to
[01:47:24.924 --> 01:47:29.065]  Steel land and to make... This is how they got all the national parks, right?
[01:47:29.485 --> 01:47:29.665]  Right.
[01:47:29.685 --> 01:47:30.845]  Back in the early 90s.
[01:47:30.865 --> 01:47:34.066]  This is covered in Alex Jones' America Destroyed by Design.
[01:47:34.126 --> 01:47:34.626]  But continue.
[01:47:35.066 --> 01:47:35.726]  Right.
[01:47:36.547 --> 01:47:51.810]  This past Sunday, they had a special session in the Senate to give over 2 million acres in California and a few other states to... Well, they say it's to America, but it's actually going to be ceded to the United Nations.
[01:47:52.329 --> 01:47:57.631]  Well, listen, I'd really appreciate it if you emailed that information to Aaron at Infowars.com.
[01:47:57.651 --> 01:47:58.972]  That is a story that we need to do.
[01:47:59.292 --> 01:48:00.113]  I thank you for the call.
[01:48:00.133 --> 01:48:00.773]  We've got to move on.
[01:48:02.414 --> 01:48:06.916]  I mean, folks, it's been going on for years and years and years, and the more land they give up, the more suspect it becomes.
[01:48:07.196 --> 01:48:08.616]  I mean, are they going to put in NATO troops?
[01:48:08.656 --> 01:48:10.717]  Is this where they're going to make the makeshift FEMA camps?
[01:48:11.478 --> 01:48:13.539]  Are they just going to restrict our movement even further?
[01:48:13.659 --> 01:48:17.961]  I mean, that's part of the plan, is to restrict us into this grid where we all live in compact cities.
[01:48:18.801 --> 01:48:19.922]  You know, it's in their own plans.
[01:48:20.062 --> 01:48:22.783]  And that's after they kill about 80% of us.
[01:48:22.823 --> 01:48:30.526]  Remember, Joe Biden talking about overpopulation in his little lovely article, How I Learned to Love the New World Order.
[01:48:30.666 --> 01:48:31.887]  Remember, Mao wasn't slick enough.
[01:48:31.927 --> 01:48:33.588]  We need to be a little slicker than Mao.
[01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:36.189]  Joe Biden, check it out yourself.
[01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.969]  That's his quote.
[01:48:37.309 --> 01:48:41.011]  We need to be a little bit slicker than Mao to pull off this whole globalist effort.
[01:48:41.631 --> 01:48:43.732]  You know, we don't need to do it by the barrel of the gun.
[01:48:43.752 --> 01:48:45.733]  Let's brainwash the people and then soft kill them.
[01:48:46.393 --> 01:48:47.234]  That's the essence of it.
[01:48:47.768 --> 01:48:50.129]  All right, let's go to Steve in Florida.
[01:48:50.169 --> 01:48:51.069]  Steve, what's on your mind?
[01:48:51.089 --> 01:48:59.752]  I was just about trying to get the word out about the Federal Reserve.
[01:48:59.792 --> 01:49:06.595]  I saw Dennis Kucinich on the floor blaming them for the mess that we're in, and I was wondering if
[01:49:07.817 --> 01:49:08.778]  Alex could get a hold of him.
[01:49:23.075 --> 01:49:24.415]  We gotta get Kucinich on the line.
[01:49:24.475 --> 01:49:25.376]  Get his people.
[01:49:25.436 --> 01:49:25.996]  Come on, Dykes.
[01:49:26.056 --> 01:49:28.497]  Dykes does like seven jobs, all right?
[01:49:28.817 --> 01:49:31.277]  Dykes is now, you know, booking guests.
[01:49:31.597 --> 01:49:33.138]  He's uploading stuff to the website.
[01:49:33.198 --> 01:49:33.818]  He's writing.
[01:49:33.898 --> 01:49:35.599]  He's working on the new Obama film.
[01:49:36.359 --> 01:49:37.039]  You know, it's tough.
[01:49:37.299 --> 01:49:45.221]  And we want to get Kucinich on that, because that Federal Express line is something we've been talking about on this program for years and years and years.
[01:49:45.542 --> 01:49:48.662]  And to see it on the House floor... Not the House floor, I'm sorry.
[01:49:51.668 --> 01:49:57.433]  I never even knew anything about this.
[01:49:57.714 --> 01:50:04.541]  My dad is a CEO of a big company on the East Coast and he thought that the Treasury made the money.
[01:50:05.001 --> 01:50:07.924]  We got stuck in the mortgage crisis and someone kind of told me that
[01:50:12.355 --> 01:50:15.258]  You know, because I always thought that it was the government that raised the interest rate 17 times in a row.
[01:50:15.278 --> 01:50:24.085]  Well, first of all, what happens is, the Federal Reserve Banking System has a board of, I believe, 13 members, and they serve 8-year terms.
[01:50:24.306 --> 01:50:25.727]  And you and I don't even vote on that.
[01:50:26.127 --> 01:50:28.389]  The people that we vote for for office vote on that.
[01:50:28.749 --> 01:50:30.191]  And then they're given carte blanche, you know?
[01:50:30.391 --> 01:50:36.336]  That's why they hired Greenspan at that time, because Greenspan spoke out against them, and they made him join the league, you know?
[01:50:36.436 --> 01:50:37.577]  Come to the Bohemian Grove.
[01:50:37.918 --> 01:50:39.299]  You will head the Federal Reserve!
[01:50:41.214 --> 01:50:44.356]  It's Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, The Alex Jones Show.

[01:54:03.009 --> 01:54:04.650]  I'm going to give you about 30 seconds each.
[01:54:05.711 --> 01:54:06.972]  You know, we had an interesting show today.
[01:54:07.012 --> 01:54:08.333]  We had some racists call in.
[01:54:09.775 --> 01:54:11.036]  We talked about glowing pigs.
[01:54:11.256 --> 01:54:13.839]  We really got down to who Joe Biden is.
[01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:17.642]  Not only his Pakistani relationship, his globalist relationship.
[01:54:17.662 --> 01:54:19.104]  Remember, this is a CFR guy.
[01:54:19.344 --> 01:54:21.626]  This is a guy that's well aware of the New World Order.
[01:54:22.227 --> 01:54:23.808]  This is an establishment guy they picked.
[01:54:24.549 --> 01:54:24.889]  Alright?

[01:54:31.715 --> 01:54:32.276]  We loop it.
[01:54:33.337 --> 01:54:35.078]  Become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:54:35.118 --> 01:54:38.962]  Before I was working with Alex Jones, I supported InfoWars.com.
[01:54:39.363 --> 01:54:42.706]  I was a member and now there's a hundred times more things.
[01:54:42.826 --> 01:54:45.469]  Before you used to get his weekly program and just his movies.
[01:54:45.489 --> 01:54:46.670]  You get so much more now.
[01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:48.091]  Now you get a daily program.
[01:54:48.792 --> 01:54:49.893]  It's not just a weekly program.
[01:54:49.913 --> 01:54:50.734]  You get a daily program.
[01:54:50.754 --> 01:54:52.215]  The guy's on four hours a day.
[01:54:52.455 --> 01:54:57.859]  I can't tell you how hard it is to do four hours of radio a day, but somehow I managed to do it.
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:01.522]  So without further ado, let's go to William in Alabama.
[01:55:01.582 --> 01:55:02.583]  William, what's on your mind?
[01:55:05.025 --> 01:55:07.707]  I need to check your mind space as soon as you get off the air.
[01:55:07.727 --> 01:55:18.356]  I sent you some information today about a sheriff that's here in Pickens County, Alabama who ended up in El Paso, Texas this past weekend and stopped by the sheriff's department
[01:55:19.708 --> 01:55:20.409]  I can't think of a name.
[01:55:20.449 --> 01:55:22.550]  I've got the news article right here in front of me.
[01:55:23.210 --> 01:55:26.472]  But it was conflicting stories about why he was there.
[01:55:26.492 --> 01:55:34.076]  The news is saying that he was there to scope out jails because they're intending on making an expansion to the Piggins County Jail.
[01:55:34.876 --> 01:55:38.518]  But everything that I found, it don't make sense.
[01:55:39.278 --> 01:55:39.999]  And what do you think it is?
[01:55:40.871 --> 01:55:41.291]  I don't know.
[01:55:42.032 --> 01:55:45.934]  So listen, send it also to Aaron at Infowars.com and we'll take a look at it.
[01:55:45.954 --> 01:55:47.235]  We'll see if there's anything suspicious.
[01:55:47.315 --> 01:55:47.936]  Thank you for the call.
[01:55:47.956 --> 01:55:48.936]  We thank you for the info.
[01:55:49.436 --> 01:55:51.398]  Let's jump to John in Ohio.
[01:55:51.478 --> 01:55:52.278]  John, what's on your mind?
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:58.402]  Yes, I've asked people to check on the Google.
[01:55:58.702 --> 01:56:01.844]  Just Google up lies concerning the Soviet Union.
[01:56:01.904 --> 01:56:03.565]  Lies concerning the Soviet Union.
[01:56:04.266 --> 01:56:08.889]  Because I believe that one of the greatest cancers on this wonderful movement is
[01:56:09.514 --> 01:56:14.558]  Accepting the global elite's secular religion, which is anti-communist propaganda.
[01:56:14.598 --> 01:56:18.021]  The bigger the lie, the more people have moved ahead in this society.
[01:56:18.041 --> 01:56:29.290]  We know about Operation Mockingbird, you can Google that up as well, where the CIA recruited all of the media to concoct false propaganda about communism, the Soviet Union, the rest of it.
[01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:38.798]  I don't know where the truth begins and leaves off, but I know we've been told a massive amount of lies, and I think it is one of the greatest problems with some of the people on this
[01:56:39.588 --> 01:56:39.848]  I don't
[01:56:55.819 --> 01:56:57.280]  Bringing in thousands of Nazis.
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:02.261]  Much of the things we think we know about the Soviet Union was concocted by Joseph Goebbels.
[01:57:02.461 --> 01:57:13.765]  It was a... And you're referring to Project Paperclip, by the way, when they shipped in a lot of the top Nazis to work in our, you know, not only our scientific facilities, but our NASA really came out of there.
[01:57:13.805 --> 01:57:17.046]  So a lot of programs were built out of, you know, Nazis.
[01:57:17.266 --> 01:57:18.407]  And the Nazis really never lost.
[01:57:18.427 --> 01:57:19.347]  They just relocated.
[01:57:19.407 --> 01:57:20.187]  That is the truth.
[01:57:20.788 --> 01:57:21.588]  I thank you for the call.
[01:57:22.248 --> 01:57:23.909]  Let's go to John in New York.
[01:57:23.969 --> 01:57:24.709]  John, what's on your mind?
[01:57:27.026 --> 01:57:27.546]  John in New York?
[01:57:27.926 --> 01:57:28.066]  Yep.
[01:57:28.466 --> 01:57:29.266]  Hey, what's going on, man?
[01:57:29.807 --> 01:57:31.967]  You mentioned Global Warming Swindle yesterday.
[01:57:32.307 --> 01:57:32.767]  Yes, I did.
[01:57:33.947 --> 01:57:34.827]  Great movie.
[01:57:35.147 --> 01:57:35.608]  I've got it.
[01:57:36.188 --> 01:57:42.449]  And it goes from start to finish as far as what, why global warming isn't happening.
[01:57:43.449 --> 01:57:45.349]  Give us a 30-second synopsis before we go.
[01:57:46.329 --> 01:57:55.531]  Well, if you've got that, you can go, but what I'm calling about is there's extra features, and it's called solar variations in clouds.
[01:57:56.267 --> 01:58:02.932]  And that tells you how the weather is influenced by the sun and cosmic rays.
[01:58:03.432 --> 01:58:04.733]  Well, I'm going to have to get that as well.
[01:58:04.753 --> 01:58:10.697]  The Great Global Warming Swindle is a great, great tool to wake people up to the propaganda that is global warming.
[01:58:11.018 --> 01:58:12.859]  I thank you so much for joining me today.
[01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:13.880]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:14.760]  I'll be with you tomorrow.
[01:58:15.061 --> 01:58:16.882]  I'm Jason Burmess, InfoWars.com.
[01:58:26.178 --> 01:58:27.761]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
