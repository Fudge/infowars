[00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:04.076]  It's already Thursday, the 16th day of July 2009.
[00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:13.482]  And for this hour and five minutes into the next hour, we have Wayne Hall, CPA and brother of Representative Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:31.448]  And of course, Wayne appears in the Obama Deception, discusses the Social Security scam, the Federal Reserve, how the country is bankrupt and we are under emergency powers, and the security of the Treasury is really in control of the country, or how the Secretary of the Treasury is really in control of the country through the War Powers Act.
[00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:37.631]  In fact, let's play that scene of Wayne Paul in the Obama Deception, then we're going to go right to Wayne Paul.
[00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:38.332]  Here it is.
[00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:48.206]  In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was passed for the House where three members of Congress were on the floor.
[00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:53.088]  At that time, they only needed a majority of votes to pass it.
[00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:57.250]  So in 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was passed.
[00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:05.775]  Twenty years later, 1933, under Roosevelt, the United States was declared bankrupt.
[00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:17.549]  And in 1933, the Federal Reserve Private Bank says, OK, USA, what are you going to pledge as collateral on the debt you owe me?
[00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.570]  What happened by 1936?
[00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.891]  Does anybody know?
[00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:35.337]  We instituted social security system, and you and I and our children and our children's children were pledged as collateral on the debt of our government to the Federal Reserve.
[00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:37.997]  And that's where we're at today.
[00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:49.883]  It took 20 years to make this country bankrupt and since then our government has operated under emergency powers of our government.
[00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:55.126]  It is not the president that makes the decision in this country.
[00:01:56.425 --> 00:02:06.290]  It's the Secretary of Treasury who turns around and is put in there by the Federal Reserve to manage the bankruptcy.
[00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.211]  We've been in bankruptcy ever since.
[00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:14.414]  So to print $700 billion and to give it away, how do they get away with it?
[00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:19.636]  The manager of the bankruptcy is told by the Federal Reserve this is the way to go.
[00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:21.577]  That's where we're at today.
[00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:33.766]  Yes, we should point out, Congressman Ron Paul now has a huge amount of sponsors for a bill in the House of Representatives to abolish the private Federal Reserve.
[00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:34.707]  Alright, here we go folks.
[00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:39.669]  We're going to go ahead and go back now to our guest, Wayne Paul.
[00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:41.850]  Wayne, it's great to have you here with us today.
[00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.471]  It's good to be on board.
[00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.732]  Where are you joining us from today?
[00:02:47.093 --> 00:02:49.754]  I'm in East Texas at my home today.
[00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:53.526]  Fantastic, great to have you on with us.
[00:02:54.826 --> 00:03:19.875]  Wayne, there's so much to talk about, but let's begin with the issue you were just discussing, how this country was taken into receivership through fraud, because these shysters, these rhinestone con artists, these flim-flam artists, they create all this out of nothing, and they basically buy up the world out of nothing, and so they want to create a debt black hole
[00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:28.889]  A system to bankrupt the planet to then bring in their new world order, their new bank of the world, which they admit we're going to be paying our carbon taxes to.
[00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:33.031]  And you so eloquently broke that down, but can you further comment on that?
[00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:34.692]  Then we're going to go back to the beginning.
[00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:47.479]  I want to talk about you growing up with your brother outside Pittsburgh on a dairy farm and just what formed a great family like yours and then looking forward into some of the current things that are happening today.
[00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:56.821]  Well, I think the most fascinating thing is the bill that's on the floor of the House now as it relates to Audit the Fed.
[00:03:57.802 --> 00:04:13.052]  If somebody would have said to me five years ago that there would have been over 240 congressmen putting their name on the line to have the Federal Reserve Bank audited, I'd have never believed it.
[00:04:14.332 --> 00:04:15.013]  That alone
[00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:38.796]  It tells you and I and your listeners that the understanding of how the Federal Reserve Bank works and what it does to turn around and confiscate our private property, it's an amazing feat and I think that's something that will be changing the world if we can get that accomplished.
[00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:42.208]  Absolutely.
[00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:47.650]  You know, I love it when your brother's on television and they say, abolish the Federal Reserve, get rid of the income tax.
[00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:53.032]  How are we going to do that when we have to fund the government?
[00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:57.014]  And Ron Paul always says, this building behind me, the Capitol, was built
[00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.626]  For a hundred plus years before we had this foreign banking takeover.
[00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:06.353]  Can you get into the nature of the Federal Reserve, the War Powers Act?
[00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:10.299]  Go back through what you talked about in that video clip, but in more detail.
[00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:11.881]  The nature of our rulers.
[00:05:13.323 --> 00:05:18.244]  It is amazing that five, ten years ago, almost no one knew it was a private run-for-profit criminal group.
[00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:24.726]  Now, it's a big national issue that nobody can audit it, that it says it's above the law, it won't tell Congress.
[00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:29.727]  Senator Sanders and others, and your brother, the Congressman Ron Paul, say, where's the money, where'd it go?
[00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:31.828]  And Bernanke says, I'm not going to tell you!
[00:05:32.388 --> 00:05:41.830]  Everybody, even if they're dumbed down, knows fundamentally nobody's above the law, and they're asking, who are these private bankers that own everything and control the issuance of currency and credit?
[00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.851]  I think the fascinating thing about that is if you go to the Federal Reserve Act that was passed in 1913
[00:06:08.837 --> 00:06:30.121]  In that act, and in the bill, if anybody's interested, go on the web, under government, and read that act, and they define that the green stuff we have in our pocket, it is defined as a Federal Reserve Accounting Unit Dollar.
[00:06:31.582 --> 00:06:36.423]  Take the first letter of each one of those words, and what do you have?
[00:06:38.644 --> 00:06:43.105]  Reserve accounting unit dollar.
[00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:48.146]  They told us in 1913 what they were doing.
[00:06:50.307 --> 00:06:54.568]  Because those five letters spell fraud.
[00:06:56.568 --> 00:07:04.610]  So when you hear the vernacular that says, uh, fraud notes in your pocket, you understand where people got that thing.
[00:07:06.204 --> 00:07:24.548]  And that having been created then, we're now at a point where printing dollars no longer can be sustained by the productivity of free enterprise.
[00:07:25.788 --> 00:07:28.569]  There's just too many dollars in circulation.
[00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:30.929]  And I think
[00:07:32.063 --> 00:07:50.747]  As you say, uneducated or people that don't have their research done or haven't done their research understand when they go to the store and go to buy a loaf of bread and it's now $2.50 and I used to buy a loaf of bread for 29 cents.
[00:07:51.868 --> 00:07:53.068]  Something's wrong with somewhere.
[00:07:56.237 --> 00:07:57.598]  Well it absolutely is.
[00:07:58.438 --> 00:08:11.047]  And now they're going to a whole new unit of a global SDR where the central banks don't even have it backed up by the nation states or by the people paying the income tax into the private federal reserve.
[00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:17.731]  Now it's just SDRs that are above even the nation state currency.
[00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:21.033]  So we're already going to this global cashless society right now.
[00:08:21.093 --> 00:08:25.296]  It's just a mopping up process to get rid of the national currencies or to convert them
[00:08:25.876 --> 00:08:25.976]  Yes.
[00:08:42.227 --> 00:08:45.410]  Well, I think the exciting thing for me is the fact that even though I've known this
[00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:13.457]  And studied it for 25 years.
[00:09:13.477 --> 00:09:23.104]  I think I'm reminded most of all in this past year of a young gentleman in our area who is a senior in high school.
[00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:32.212]  And for his passage of his senior year, he had to write a senior thesis.
[00:09:33.392 --> 00:09:40.418]  And he studied and wrote his thesis on the Federal Reserve System and how it operated.
[00:09:41.443 --> 00:09:55.268]  And for me, a young person, age 17, having the knowledge that this fella has as to how it operates, got to be the most exciting thing.
[00:09:55.528 --> 00:10:06.813]  I look forward to the future only because I think, as Congressman Paul pointed out, it's the education process that really counts.
[00:10:07.913 --> 00:10:10.494]  And when we can see that in our young people,
[00:10:11.554 --> 00:10:34.797]  I can see light at the end of the tunnel that we're going to turn around and we're going to create a constitutional republic form of government and it's going to take all of us, starting from the local city offices to the county, to the state, to the federal, but it will change because of knowledge.
[00:10:36.946 --> 00:10:41.509]  And when we win, we're going to have a second renaissance in this country and appreciate it.
[00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:48.153]  Because you don't really appreciate something until you've had to fight for it or until you've lost it and then fought for it and gotten it back.
[00:10:48.954 --> 00:10:50.355]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:10:50.895 --> 00:10:53.136]  I am looking forward to that day.
[00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:56.999]  And I intend to be here when that day happens.
[00:10:59.209 --> 00:11:02.730]  Well, so many times in history, tyrants and tyrannies collapse.
[00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:08.771]  I think Gandhi, to paraphrase him, said it looks like the dictator, the corrupt leaders are invincible, but then suddenly they just collapse.
[00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:15.833]  You gotta just keep throwing the punches in there and not giving up, knowing we're gonna... That's like George Washington.
[00:11:16.193 --> 00:11:23.815]  When he finally won the war and they surrendered, he was stunned for several hours and didn't believe them, didn't understand after seven years of fighting.
[00:11:25.669 --> 00:11:26.089]  Stay there.
[00:11:26.149 --> 00:11:27.450]  Wayne Paul, always amazing.
[00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.650]  This is his maiden voyage on radio with us.
[00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.751]  Got a host of issues coming up.

[00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:38.007]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:12:38.728 --> 00:12:44.050]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:50.753]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:12:51.093 --> 00:12:52.914]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:12:53.054 --> 00:12:55.435]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:12:55.515 --> 00:13:06.479]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:13:08.699 --> 00:13:09.980]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.761]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:18.463]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:26.913]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:27.414 --> 00:13:28.556]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:28.997 --> 00:13:30.179]  The people strike back!
[00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:32.027]  Good day.
[00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:33.649]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:13:33.809 --> 00:13:34.070]  July 16, 2009.
[00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.111]  Gold opened this morning at $940.
[00:13:35.151 --> 00:13:37.754]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $966.96, $4348 for a half-ounce, or $241.74 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:13:37.774 --> 00:13:38.354]  That's $966.96, $483.48, or $241.74.
[00:13:49.386 --> 00:13:53.188]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[00:13:53.348 --> 00:13:57.390]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:02.032]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[00:14:02.212 --> 00:14:07.595]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[00:14:07.755 --> 00:14:10.917]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:15.779]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust, or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:19.060]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:25.683]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems, or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[00:14:25.803 --> 00:14:29.304]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:31.025 --> 00:14:37.207]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[00:14:37.327 --> 00:14:42.789]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[00:14:42.969 --> 00:14:44.050]  The answer is simple.
[00:14:47.802 --> 00:14:48.543]  We're good.
[00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:05.476]  We're good to go.
[00:15:38.493 --> 00:15:40.314]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:15:43.055 --> 00:15:46.097]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:15:46.117 --> 00:15:49.018]  Run on for a long time.
[00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:51.820]  Run on for a long time.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.961]  Sooner or later gotta put you down.
[00:15:55.502 --> 00:15:57.102]  Sooner or later gotta put you down.
[00:15:57.202 --> 00:16:02.425]  I like the Texas Ranger Credo, which is actually borrowed from one of the founding Texas Rangers.
[00:16:02.745 --> 00:16:07.868]  A man in the wrong can't stop a man in the right that keeps on a coming.
[00:16:09.941 --> 00:16:13.022]  And that's what we've got to do, because these people mean business.
[00:16:13.042 --> 00:16:13.502]  We're fighting.
[00:16:13.782 --> 00:16:15.382]  Short segment right now, long one coming up.
[00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:20.743]  I wanted to get to some of the things that Wayne may never have talked about on air.
[00:16:21.104 --> 00:16:31.626]  First, then we'll get back into solutions and where this country's going, and his brother and the family, and now one of his nephews, Rand Paul, it looks like, is going to run for the Congress.
[00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:43.114]  But go back to your rural upbringing, some stories about you and your brothers, about Ron, and about what it's been like for you.
[00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:54.244]  How you woke up, how he woke up, or were you guys born awake, being born to hard-working farmers, dairy farmers, all you guys working from the time you were about
[00:16:55.024 --> 00:16:56.045]  Six, seven years old.
[00:16:56.405 --> 00:16:58.828]  Were you guys born awake, or what was the process like?
[00:17:00.009 --> 00:17:05.193]  Let us into a window of the icon that is your brother, Dr. Ron Paul, and yourself, of course.
[00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:06.254]  Okay.
[00:17:07.295 --> 00:17:10.178]  We were born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:17.925]  Small rural town, and my mother and father had a dairy milk processing and delivery business.
[00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:21.168]  It started out in the basement of our house.
[00:17:22.379 --> 00:17:27.142]  And my mom and dad worked seven days a week to process bottled milk and deliver it.
[00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:37.488]  And we were always required on Sundays to go to church Sunday morning and my dad took off enough time to go to church.
[00:17:38.589 --> 00:17:42.512]  But he worked seven days a week up until I was in fifth grade.
[00:17:43.272 --> 00:17:45.834]  Now I'm the youngest of five boys.
[00:17:46.614 --> 00:17:49.436]  Ron is the middle of the five of us.
[00:17:50.171 --> 00:17:56.875]  So we claim he's the spoiled one in the family because the two oldest ones paid the wage for him.
[00:17:57.755 --> 00:18:02.338]  And then we were never allowed to do anything, but we always say Ron got away with all of it.
[00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:08.461]  I'm saying that because he can't rebut that on this radio show.
[00:18:08.481 --> 00:18:11.162]  So, um, be careful.
[00:18:11.262 --> 00:18:12.943]  I might deny that later on.
[00:18:14.624 --> 00:18:15.565]  Anyway, um,
[00:18:17.069 --> 00:18:39.636]  My revelation into this knowledge started back in the early seventies, and it had to do with my representation of a taxpayer who, after I started to represent him, he ended up, six weeks after I met him, passing away.
[00:18:39.656 --> 00:18:45.498]  And it was a direct result of the confrontation he had
[00:18:46.713 --> 00:18:48.434]  With the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:18:49.434 --> 00:18:49.534]  Oh.
[00:18:50.015 --> 00:18:57.118]  And I said to myself, if this is the way it is, I'm not going to ever do another tax return.
[00:18:58.018 --> 00:19:00.740]  Because something's not right in the system.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:14.246]  So that was my awakening call, and that started my research, my documentation, and everything that I've learned from that point on.
[00:19:16.778 --> 00:19:35.508]  Help me in better stead, made me better understand, and I think when people understand and learn, even if they can't do anything about it, they're better off morally, they're better off spiritually, and they're better off in their dealings with their fellow man.
[00:19:35.949 --> 00:19:37.670]  That makes all the difference in the world.
[00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:42.307]  What woke your brother up?
[00:19:42.527 --> 00:19:46.150]  Tell us about Congressman Ron Paul, your brother.
[00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:58.939]  Well, I think Ron's timing was the fact that when he was in college and medical school and working, he always had spare time.
[00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:06.886]  And he got involved in research and study of Ludwig von Mises.
[00:20:07.526 --> 00:20:09.888]  And von Mises is the father
[00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:14.151]  of free enterprise Austrian economics.
[00:20:15.231 --> 00:20:25.575]  And there's a von Mises Institute that's in existence today that's extremely successful and continues to support free enterprise economics.
[00:20:25.895 --> 00:20:27.436]  And it's headed up by Lou Rockwell.
[00:20:27.756 --> 00:20:28.557]  That is correct.
[00:20:28.657 --> 00:20:39.101]  And it made a lot of sense to him, so he started to apply it not only in his professional life,
[00:20:39.795 --> 00:20:49.622]  But in his personal life and was extremely successful in the implementation of free enterprise economics.
[00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:57.748]  And it was at that time that he started to formulate the idea that he needed to teach this to other people.
[00:20:58.769 --> 00:20:59.410]  Alright, stay there.
[00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.332]  Let's continue with this on the other side and also talk about your saga.
[00:21:02.372 --> 00:21:04.774]  You've had quite a story as well.
[00:21:04.894 --> 00:21:06.295]  And then we'll open the phones up.
[00:21:07.094 --> 00:21:11.098]  Or Wayne Paul, brother of Congressman Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:21:11.118 --> 00:21:11.419]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:21:11.439 --> 00:21:11.499]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:11.859]  Stay with us.
[00:21:11.899 --> 00:21:13.821]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:15.082]  We're on the march.
[00:21:15.142 --> 00:21:16.384]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:16.464 --> 00:21:20.087]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:31.527 --> 00:21:32.627]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.907 --> 00:21:34.688]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:21:34.908 --> 00:21:35.548]  Well, you should.
[00:21:35.888 --> 00:21:40.130]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.850]  That's right.
[00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:49.653]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:51.094]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:21:51.194 --> 00:21:52.334]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:21:52.554 --> 00:21:58.177]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:21:58.537 --> 00:22:05.061]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:22:05.421 --> 00:22:10.624]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:22:10.944 --> 00:22:12.084]  This is real.
[00:22:12.405 --> 00:22:13.145]  Don't miss out.
[00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:20.329]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit or pennies on the dollar.
[00:22:20.569 --> 00:22:21.830]  And get your free handgun.
[00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.171]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:27.874]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:22:28.074 --> 00:22:30.996]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:22:31.857 --> 00:22:36.820]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:23:01.817 --> 00:23:01.977]  I think?
[00:23:31.817 --> 00:23:33.398]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:23:33.498 --> 00:23:38.100]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.002]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:23:41.202 --> 00:23:44.084]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:23:44.244 --> 00:23:50.107]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:23:50.327 --> 00:23:53.269]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation that you use.
[00:23:53.570 --> 00:24:00.475]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:24:00.555 --> 00:24:03.678]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:24:03.838 --> 00:24:04.038]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:24:04.098 --> 00:24:05.719]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.

[00:24:15.227 --> 00:24:18.990]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.351]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:24:20.371 --> 00:24:20.951]  Take action today.
[00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:22.773]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:24:38.123 --> 00:24:45.572]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:45.592 --> 00:24:46.213]  to 3 p.m.
[00:24:46.253 --> 00:24:47.655]  Central Standard Time.
[00:24:48.095 --> 00:24:50.518]  We're here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:52.501 --> 00:24:55.144]  Jason Burmas will be here live this Sunday when I'm out of town.
[00:24:56.483 --> 00:25:00.767]  He jumps on a big jet airplane and goes out to do interviews for his film, Invisible Enemies.
[00:25:01.548 --> 00:25:04.511]  That's what I'm off doing, is doing interviews for the next film.
[00:25:05.071 --> 00:25:08.014]  We're going to go back to Wayne Paul here in just a moment and your phone calls.
[00:25:09.153 --> 00:25:15.399]  But before we do that, speaking of the free market, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors we have to make this radio show possible.
[00:25:15.739 --> 00:25:16.961]  And I do believe in these sponsors.
[00:25:16.981 --> 00:25:18.462]  We only take sponsors that I believe in.
[00:25:18.482 --> 00:25:19.423]  I think they have great products.
[00:25:19.843 --> 00:25:22.306]  And one of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[00:25:22.326 --> 00:25:24.087]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:25.629]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[00:25:26.089 --> 00:25:30.994]  Electricity should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[00:25:31.474 --> 00:25:35.019]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor Solutions from Science.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.624]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 watt generator.
[00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:44.313]  And a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[00:25:44.653 --> 00:25:46.714]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas.
[00:25:47.154 --> 00:25:51.036]  But in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[00:25:51.457 --> 00:25:53.298]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[00:25:53.318 --> 00:25:55.939]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:57.720]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.921]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:01.162]  Or give them a call toll-free, 877-327-0365.
[00:26:01.182 --> 00:26:01.222]  877-327-0365.
[00:26:08.729 --> 00:26:12.192]  And one other sponsor I wanted to let you know about is HomeGain.
[00:26:12.212 --> 00:26:18.358]  You can check out Max Little Orange Gorilla at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:26:18.398 --> 00:26:20.079]  It's a completely free site.
[00:26:21.232 --> 00:26:22.293]  It is advertiser-driven.
[00:26:22.513 --> 00:26:23.313]  It's a fabulous site.
[00:26:23.333 --> 00:26:24.634]  I've been around for more than 10 years.
[00:26:24.974 --> 00:26:27.036]  My favorite thing they have is the Home Sale Maximizer.
[00:26:28.056 --> 00:26:39.083]  You put in what type of house you have, the region it's in, the most inexpensive upgrades to do, the best resale, little things you can do, little tricks that really help get it sold for a higher price.
[00:26:39.844 --> 00:26:41.825]  They have the Street View thing that's free as well.
[00:26:41.845 --> 00:26:43.166]  They have a free estimate.
[00:26:43.806 --> 00:26:48.790]  You type in your home address, you'll get a free estimate of your home's value from the internal system that the realtors are seeing.
[00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:50.971]  It's HomeGain.com.
[00:26:51.171 --> 00:26:53.233]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[00:26:53.293 --> 00:26:55.534]  HomeGain.com.
[00:26:57.276 --> 00:27:02.679]  Okay, going back to Wayne Paul, Dr. Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul's brother.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.401]  Finishing up with your upbringing.
[00:27:06.371 --> 00:27:08.493]  So your brother gets into the free market economics.
[00:27:08.533 --> 00:27:09.574]  He's a doctor.
[00:27:11.216 --> 00:27:14.619]  Then I guess you sort of get involved with Barry Goldwater somehow.
[00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:17.081]  Tell us more about the inside scoop on your brother.
[00:27:18.062 --> 00:27:31.655]  Well I think his total goal and effort when he first decided to run for Congress was to educate people in understanding free enterprise economics.
[00:27:32.654 --> 00:27:39.579]  And he said to Carol, his wife, the first time he ran, he said, uh, don't worry, Carol.
[00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:40.599]  I'm not going to win.
[00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:43.301]  I just want to get the message out.
[00:27:44.001 --> 00:27:49.105]  Well, the first time he didn't win, but she says, what are you going to do if you do win?
[00:27:49.605 --> 00:27:52.027]  Well, the next time he ran, he won.
[00:27:53.167 --> 00:28:00.332]  Now, when he first ran for Congress back in the mid seventies,
[00:28:01.621 --> 00:28:25.513]  He had a platform, one page platform he was running on, and it just so happens that my wife gave him his first contribution, and he sent her a thank you note, and the second page was his platform of what he was running on, which was basically free enterprise economics.
[00:28:26.614 --> 00:28:31.156]  But if you were to read that single page today,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.644]  You would think he wrote it yesterday, because he's never changed.
[00:28:37.344 --> 00:28:53.737]  And I think that's the most consistent thing that anybody can ever say, as far as my brother's concerned, is he's never wavered from the truth, and from the facts, and from the Constitution.
[00:28:56.314 --> 00:29:02.295]  He has just been amazing and steadfast in that, and I think people today now realize that.
[00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:05.236]  And you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:08.656]  Do you remember any of the things on that one-page platform?
[00:29:10.096 --> 00:29:18.658]  Well, I can't remember right off, except while I'm talking, we'll find it.
[00:29:18.898 --> 00:29:19.818]  Maybe my wife can.
[00:29:19.838 --> 00:29:20.678]  Sure, sure, sure.
[00:29:21.058 --> 00:29:24.759]  Coming up after the next break, if you can, it's just very, very interesting history here.
[00:29:25.649 --> 00:29:26.970]  I don't think so.
[00:29:45.270 --> 00:30:05.419]  During that campaign, but that they were worried about the movement, that the biggest movement now in high schools and universities wasn't the controlled left paradigm or the controlled right paradigm of the collectivist, but that people were now rediscovering the Bill of Rights Constitution and becoming free market constitutionalists, and that people were discovering the private Federal Reserve.
[00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:06.980]  And I think they had well-founded fears.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.121]  Now here we are a year and a half later,
[00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:22.746]  And we've gone from almost, and I know I keep repeating this, no one knowing the Fed was private, being laughed at, to now the enemies had to come out in the open and go, okay, we're private, but we run things for your own good, and if you audit us, we'll cause a depression.
[00:30:23.026 --> 00:30:25.047]  Basically terrorism, economic terrorism.
[00:30:25.927 --> 00:30:38.672]  And we have open announcements of a new Bank of the World we'll pay our carbon taxes to, and now for world government, and hundreds and hundreds of articles a month pushing this on us, and nobody's buying it.
[00:30:39.878 --> 00:30:42.199]  All the things we talked about have come true and are happening.
[00:30:42.239 --> 00:30:54.086]  We're now at this key battle point in history that your brother talked about, that I talked about, that when the crisis came, when the bankers were imploding the world economy by design to bring in their system, that was a weak point for them.
[00:30:54.326 --> 00:31:07.814]  Their great moment of triumph, but also their weak point, if we point out, hey, the emperor's butt naked, this is a fraud, the emperor's new clothes, and now to really see it so viral, this idea of liberty,
[00:31:10.951 --> 00:31:12.752]  I mean, this shows us we can have victory.
[00:31:12.772 --> 00:31:13.633]  This gives us hope.
[00:31:13.913 --> 00:31:23.819]  It shows people that had kind of given up, who had been fighting for decades like yourself, not saying you ever did, that none of this was done for naught.
[00:31:25.139 --> 00:31:30.282]  That the seeds we planted that a lot of people ignored are now sprouting in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:31:30.302 --> 00:31:34.625]  Can you speak to just the amazing revolution of liberty and freedom we're seeing?
[00:31:35.485 --> 00:31:39.848]  Well, I have a book sitting in front of me that I continually
[00:31:40.478 --> 00:32:00.195]  Tomorrow when reread it's called the history of our national debt the coming battle it's written by Lorraine and Paul Walters and if somebody really wants to understand where we're at if they read this history
[00:32:01.064 --> 00:32:05.269]  Yeah, didn't they republish that from an 1898 book and they wrote the foreword?
[00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:06.411]  That is correct.
[00:32:06.951 --> 00:32:07.752]  That's an excellent book.
[00:32:09.134 --> 00:32:14.240]  And it is so enlightening that it's worth
[00:32:15.354 --> 00:32:17.656]  Uh, read by anybody interested in it.
[00:32:17.896 --> 00:32:21.259]  I keep reading it because I learn something new every time.
[00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:32.047]  And for those that don't know, this was a guy, I read it 10 years ago when he republished it, in banking, who saw all this coming and said, we're being taken over by bankers, uh, 15 years before they did it.
[00:32:32.808 --> 00:32:33.988]  Yeah, that's correct.
[00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:43.636]  Uh, in Ron's letter to my wife, he says, I want to cut spending, cut taxes,
[00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:45.870]  I want to cut inflation.
[00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.711]  I want to have honest money.
[00:32:50.711 --> 00:32:52.351]  I want to cut crime.
[00:32:52.451 --> 00:32:55.692]  I want to let people live in peace and security.
[00:32:56.832 --> 00:33:00.233]  And I want to get rid of government controls and regulations.
[00:33:01.793 --> 00:33:09.494]  And that was basically one sheet of paper that he wrote back in 1974, which was the first time he ran.
[00:33:10.835 --> 00:33:13.235]  And his motto at that time was to say,
[00:33:14.264 --> 00:33:21.151]  Speaking of your brother, let me ask you a question, Wayne Paul.
[00:33:33.237 --> 00:33:39.240]  I challenged him about two months before he announced for president privately on the phone when he was on as a guest during the break.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.140]  I said, please run.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.381]  You gotta do it just to educate the public.
[00:33:42.701 --> 00:33:44.942]  You morally cannot say no.
[00:33:44.982 --> 00:33:47.503]  I know you don't want to fly around and do the thousands of speeches.
[00:33:47.543 --> 00:33:49.184]  I know you already have an exhausting schedule.
[00:33:49.584 --> 00:33:53.286]  I know you're a real statesman, but I said, you must run for president.
[00:33:53.826 --> 00:33:53.926]  Well,
[00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:40.186]  I think it all boils down to whether the people were ready to hear the message in such a large arena as running for president.
[00:34:41.227 --> 00:34:50.411]  And I think he became amazed at the crowd, the numbers of people, the contributions he
[00:34:52.262 --> 00:35:13.096]  The effort that was put forth by people all over the country, the number of young people that came out and supported him, it actually, I think, blew him away and made him a very humble individual because he never expected it to be as big as it really was.
[00:35:14.737 --> 00:35:19.060]  So I think he was humbled by it.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.921]  I think he was in awe by it.
[00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:31.001]  And I think every hour of every moment of every time he's spent doing that, he is absolutely delighted to have done it.
[00:35:31.561 --> 00:35:37.187]  And I think it continues today with his Campaign for Liberty program that he's working on now.
[00:35:38.529 --> 00:35:42.413]  Wayne, I want to talk more about the whole global picture with you and then take some calls.
[00:35:44.238 --> 00:35:55.507]  Some funny or interesting stories about your brother or your family, because people just love to hear them, that you've never told before or that you have never told on the radio before.
[00:35:56.368 --> 00:35:58.650]  Some interesting stuff about the young Ron Paul.
[00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:07.117]  Well, I think one of the most interesting things that I think of is he used to work in a drugstore.
[00:36:07.957 --> 00:36:10.920]  So we called him the soda jerk of the day.
[00:36:12.324 --> 00:36:16.825]  And he would use a bicycle to go a mile, work, and then come home.
[00:36:17.685 --> 00:36:26.027]  And he'd always work late in the evening, up till 10 o'clock, to close the store, and then bike home.
[00:36:26.487 --> 00:36:35.949]  Well, he always had a ritual in his own mind as to how quickly he could get home, so he was always timing himself.
[00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:49.036]  But one evening he was coming home and going up the hill and he was pumping so hard and so fast that he forgot to look in front of him and he ran into a parked car.
[00:36:51.277 --> 00:36:54.939]  And that parked car demolished the front of his bike.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:05.986]  But he picked up the bike and walked the other half mile to get home and when he got home his collarbone was sticking outside of his shirt.
[00:37:07.928 --> 00:37:16.455]  That's just the type of person he was, and he wanted to make sure nobody took his bike, so he dragged it home with him.
[00:37:18.456 --> 00:37:24.481]  That's just the way he is, and most of the five of us are fairly competitive.
[00:37:25.282 --> 00:37:28.864]  My oldest brother has his PhD in mathematics.
[00:37:29.985 --> 00:37:37.411]  The next brother is a doctor of divinity, and of course Ron has three different degrees in medicine.
[00:37:38.416 --> 00:37:48.398]  My next brother has a Doctor of Divinity also, so I have a brother who's a Lutheran minister and one that's a Presbyterian minister.
[00:37:48.998 --> 00:37:52.499]  Good quality salt of the earth, and you're a CPA, right?
[00:37:52.799 --> 00:37:53.459]  That's correct.
[00:37:53.559 --> 00:38:01.201]  They wanted me to be an undertaker so that they could take care of everybody, bring them into the world, raise them, educate them, and I could bury them.
[00:38:01.221 --> 00:38:08.102]  So we decided that if I did that, I would have a monopoly on life and the government wouldn't let me do it.
[00:38:11.668 --> 00:38:14.629]  Just amazing stories, hearing that.
[00:38:18.249 --> 00:38:21.970]  Some of the family background, is the family on both sides German?
[00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:23.830]  Where do the Pauls come from?
[00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:33.452]  Well, my grandfather came to this country as a 12 year old from Germany, and came after his father came here before him.
[00:38:35.532 --> 00:38:39.453]  My mother was French-Irish from Alsace-Lorraine.
[00:38:40.963 --> 00:38:52.852]  But I think it was the close-knit family and our Christian ties that really was a bulwark of our life.
[00:38:54.613 --> 00:39:07.644]  One of the other interesting things about my brother, and he still has it, when he first went to Congress, he bought a little Chevy Chevette to go from his apartment to Congress every day.
[00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:12.192]  And that Chevette was two doors green.
[00:39:12.212 --> 00:39:14.233]  He still has it, by the way.
[00:39:14.253 --> 00:39:21.477]  There's pictures out of that Chevette next to Tip O'Neill's limousine.
[00:39:22.337 --> 00:39:27.860]  And he obviously was proud of showing that in his congressional office or at home.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:37.985]  So it's the interesting contrast between a very liberal individual spending your money and a very conservative just trying to represent you.
[00:39:38.733 --> 00:39:39.375]  Absolutely.
[00:39:39.396 --> 00:39:42.891]  I want to take calls in the next segment, but shifting gears to the big picture...
[00:39:44.125 --> 00:39:44.685]  Eugenics.
[00:39:44.745 --> 00:39:50.328]  I know you study banking, the Federal Reserve, but the overall plans of the global issue.
[00:39:50.428 --> 00:39:52.609]  You told me you've seen the Obama section that you're in.
[00:39:53.049 --> 00:40:00.193]  Give me your view on eugenics, the master plan, the type of people that are the collectivists and the type of societies they build.
[00:40:00.613 --> 00:40:10.778]  You know, really as an illustration of what the price is to pay if we that aren't parasites don't get things under control, we leave the world to these people.
[00:40:12.353 --> 00:40:41.649]  Yes, and that's difficult to really discuss and talk about because it's in an area that, you know, I look at my life and our family's life and as long as we stay the course and understand our responsibility, we believe that those types of things will get settled by a much higher power than us and that it is just something
[00:40:42.503 --> 00:40:56.515]  That at this stage of our life, we have to talk about, learn about, and try to understand, but it's difficult to determine how we might fight it.
[00:40:57.956 --> 00:41:04.962]  It's just incredible to really see the new world order come out in the open and uncloak itself, but it's even more incredible to see the people rise against it.
[00:41:05.402 --> 00:41:06.303]  It's just so exciting.
[00:41:06.784 --> 00:41:10.807]  Oh, I think we live in the most exciting times of our life.
[00:41:11.643 --> 00:41:14.485]  And I just, I'm looking forward to it.
[00:41:33.809 --> 00:41:41.030]  I am vaguely aware of it and saw a little bit of it but I often sit back and admire my brother because he believes as long as you're telling the truth
[00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:10.294]  And as long as you're putting forth the right effort, those types of attacks won't last very long.
[00:42:10.914 --> 00:42:12.735]  I kind of like seeing him get mad, though.
[00:42:13.156 --> 00:42:15.737]  For those that don't know, we haven't played it here because we're not being given any attention.
[00:42:15.797 --> 00:42:16.317]  I might, though.
[00:42:16.718 --> 00:42:18.038]  I mean, his video's out now.
[00:42:18.459 --> 00:42:21.120]  Ron Paul almost pops him, and it looks like shoves him.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.341]  He's like, get out of here!
[00:42:22.361 --> 00:42:24.942]  It's kind of like you tell a cow to get out in the middle of the road.
[00:42:24.962 --> 00:42:27.784]  Uh, just, just, just incredible.
[00:42:28.124 --> 00:42:29.905]  Let the media try to demonize him for that.
[00:42:32.057 --> 00:42:39.123]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:42:39.464 --> 00:42:43.847]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:48.992]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:42:49.352 --> 00:42:49.632]  I'm good.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:05.980]  This is great!
[00:43:32.501 --> 00:43:37.806]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:43:38.307 --> 00:43:45.294]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:43:45.895 --> 00:43:52.061]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:54.302]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:43:54.443 --> 00:43:56.844]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:43:56.944 --> 00:44:07.872]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:09.813]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:10.193 --> 00:44:11.574]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:12.055 --> 00:44:18.279]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:26.736]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:27.217 --> 00:44:28.377]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:28.798 --> 00:44:30.058]  The people strike back.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.901]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:44:34.461 --> 00:44:36.523]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:44:36.803 --> 00:44:38.404]  The price of food continues to rise.
[00:44:42.073 --> 00:44:42.934]  You need to prepare.
[00:44:43.334 --> 00:44:46.797]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:50.299]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:45:02.809]  At OrganicaSeed.com you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:08.253]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice,
[00:45:08.493 --> 00:45:09.033]  I think so.
[00:45:35.484 --> 00:45:38.546]  It seemed like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[00:45:38.566 --> 00:45:41.148]  Started this fight against the Federal Reserve.
[00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:44.711]  They even kidnapped congressman's kids and killed them to try to shut it down.
[00:45:44.731 --> 00:45:46.092]  But here we are.
[00:45:46.793 --> 00:45:48.174]  You can feel the momentum shifting.
[00:45:48.194 --> 00:45:55.399]  No matter what events the private bank stays, no matter what scams they run, their days are numbered.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.263]  The momentum has shifted against them and they know their destruction, their defeat is inevitable.
[00:46:02.486 --> 00:46:05.807]  Let's take a few final calls here for Wayne Paul.
[00:46:06.307 --> 00:46:09.449]  Let's talk to Ronnie in Texas, Steve, Jay, Kay, Philippe, and others.
[00:46:09.749 --> 00:46:11.109]  Ronnie, you're on the air with Wayne Paul.
[00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:11.469]  Go ahead.
[00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:12.430]  Thank you.
[00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:12.990]  Thank you, sir.
[00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.671]  Wayne Paul, you're number four for me.
[00:46:15.691 --> 00:46:16.831]  I'm so honored to speak to you.
[00:46:17.712 --> 00:46:29.456]  I spoke with obviously Dr. Paul and Carol and his other brother Randy and you, but I have a question for you and a couple of comments, but one, a photo that I saw while I was campaigning in Iowa for Dr. Paul.
[00:46:30.117 --> 00:46:51.074]  Well, that was a Congressional baseball game that the Congress took on, I think it was the Washington Senators, and Ron got the Astros to send him a uniform.
[00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:54.797]  And oddly enough, in that ball game, Ron hit a home run.
[00:46:57.366 --> 00:46:58.107]  Well, thank you.
[00:46:58.207 --> 00:47:00.008]  As you know, he's the founding father among us now.
[00:47:00.368 --> 00:47:04.091]  The force is with him!
[00:47:04.811 --> 00:47:13.817]  My major question, though, is like you, sir, I know he is not in favor of, or I'm assuming like you, he's not in favor, generally, of people doing drugs.
[00:47:13.917 --> 00:47:21.062]  But Dr. Paul is more vehemently opposed to our own continually counterproductive war on pot smokers and hemp enthusiasts.
[00:47:21.482 --> 00:47:22.943]  So equating alcohol with
[00:47:23.513 --> 00:47:27.997]  THC is a lie, and alcohol is, you know, with the fetal alcohol syndrome, etc.
[00:47:28.517 --> 00:47:31.700]  It's a toxic poison, and THC is non-toxic medicine.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.862]  Okay, listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:47:34.622 --> 00:47:44.771]  Yeah, your comments on drug decriminalization, not legalization like Soros wants, decriminalization, so that we don't spend all our time and energy locking up people that need treatment.
[00:47:46.312 --> 00:47:47.473]  And I agree with that.
[00:47:47.573 --> 00:47:51.637]  I think Ron's beliefs and my beliefs are very similar in that
[00:47:52.256 --> 00:47:58.618]  That that is a moral issue that is a personal choice of people.
[00:47:59.398 --> 00:48:02.379]  It doesn't mean that we condone it.
[00:48:02.539 --> 00:48:14.482]  It only means that we should help that individual so that those things do not become addictive and they do not start to control their life.
[00:48:15.083 --> 00:48:16.623]  Well... And that's the issue.
[00:48:18.075 --> 00:48:22.518]  Look, areas of Europe have decriminalized heroin and in some areas it's cut it by half.
[00:48:22.678 --> 00:48:23.918]  Everywhere it's gone down at least by 25%.
[00:48:24.419 --> 00:48:26.320]  People can pull those numbers up.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.642]  There's different numbers per country, different cities, but it's all a massive decrease.
[00:48:30.922 --> 00:48:38.667]  And people stop robbing your house for your stereo and computer because the stuff is super cheap and it's from a kind of government or city dispensary.
[00:48:39.147 --> 00:48:46.091]  And probably 80% of those people behind bars in prisons would not be there if it wasn't for that.
[00:48:47.128 --> 00:48:52.171]  Well, plus they admit our troops guard the poppy fields in Afghanistan, and it's up nine times.
[00:48:52.231 --> 00:48:53.913]  I mean, they're shipping it in.
[00:48:54.393 --> 00:48:55.894]  I mean, of course the elites do that.
[00:48:56.054 --> 00:49:01.838]  We're talking about hundreds of millions a year of secret money they get to fractionally reserve loan out.
[00:49:02.278 --> 00:49:05.300]  Let's take one more call here right in this hour, and we'll come back in five more minutes.
[00:49:05.881 --> 00:49:06.741]  Steve in Canada.
[00:49:07.242 --> 00:49:07.822]  You're on the air.
[00:49:07.842 --> 00:49:08.402]  Go ahead.
[00:49:09.883 --> 00:49:10.324]  Hi there, Alex.
[00:49:10.764 --> 00:49:12.485]  I'm a long-time listener, big-time fan.
[00:49:14.488 --> 00:49:17.991]  I got a comment which will lead into a question for Mr. Paul there.
[00:49:18.431 --> 00:49:21.894]  My comment is about the H.R.
[00:49:21.914 --> 00:49:27.519]  2454, the Climate Change Act that just got passed there in the states.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.021]  It hasn't passed the House, it hasn't passed the Senate.
[00:49:30.061 --> 00:49:31.503]  It hasn't yet, eh?
[00:49:31.963 --> 00:49:33.164]  That was actually one of my questions.
[00:49:34.645 --> 00:49:41.151]  If that does pass, I just want your listeners to know that there's a great video out there called the Great Global Warming Swindle.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.041]  And it's available on YouTube and Google Video and all those places.
[00:49:45.581 --> 00:49:46.261]  Yeah, it's free.
[00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:46.882]  It's incredible.
[00:49:46.902 --> 00:49:48.742]  It's got all the climatologists and scientists.
[00:49:49.603 --> 00:49:49.963]  Thank you.
[00:49:50.003 --> 00:49:50.623]  I'm going to jump.
[00:49:50.983 --> 00:49:51.503]  Great points.
[00:49:51.523 --> 00:49:58.265]  We're going to come back in 70 seconds with Wayne Paul, Ron Paul's brother and an activist against tyranny as well.
[00:49:58.285 --> 00:50:03.527]  And I guess we can say chip off the old block because he is Ron's younger brother, one of his younger brothers.
[00:50:04.427 --> 00:50:08.929]  And we will ask him about the global warming tax.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.782]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:21.681 --> 00:50:25.662]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:50:25.923 --> 00:50:27.683]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:50:27.903 --> 00:50:36.186]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:50:36.426 --> 00:50:41.668]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:50:41.988 --> 00:50:43.609]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:50.195]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:50:50.375 --> 00:51:01.125]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:51:01.405 --> 00:51:01.925]  That's right.
[00:51:02.186 --> 00:51:04.488]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:51:04.748 --> 00:51:06.349]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:51:08.891 --> 00:51:10.011]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[00:51:19.434 --> 00:51:20.774]  That's A Cola Blue dot com.
[00:51:24.695 --> 00:51:26.615]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:27.075 --> 00:51:29.856]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:42.779 --> 00:51:50.243]  All right, final minutes with Wayne Paul, a few more of your phone calls, then General Stubblebine and Dr. Lambo will be joining us to talk about eugenics.
[00:51:52.804 --> 00:52:01.728]  Wayne, global warming tax over every facet of our lives, federal inspections, total federalization, eugenics agenda for the control freaks around our lives.
[00:52:02.028 --> 00:52:05.590]  Your take on the global warming cap and trade and on eugenics.
[00:52:11.536 --> 00:52:13.096]  Wayne, are you there?
[00:52:13.437 --> 00:52:13.917]  Yes, sir.
[00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:14.857]  Okay, great.
[00:52:15.097 --> 00:52:17.558]  Your take on the global warming tax and eugenics?
[00:52:18.358 --> 00:52:30.102]  Well, as far as global warming is concerned, I do think the cat is out of the bag, that a lot of that is hoped.
[00:52:31.202 --> 00:52:34.763]  I think if we learned anything from it,
[00:52:35.626 --> 00:52:40.712]  We should be more aware of our environment and take better care of it.
[00:52:40.993 --> 00:52:47.080]  But I don't I think global warming is coming gone over the last 200 years.
[00:52:48.826 --> 00:52:53.407]  That I don't think there's anything different today than it was when we settled this country back then.
[00:52:53.447 --> 00:52:59.849]  Well I agree with you, and they piggyback legitimate environmental issues that could be handled civilly.
[00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:05.411]  You do some toxic waste dumping on somebody, they can take you to the cleaners or get you put in prison.
[00:53:06.911 --> 00:53:12.853]  But they love these new systems that are extrajudicial outside the system, and they mean business.
[00:53:12.873 --> 00:53:13.173]  Go ahead.
[00:53:13.593 --> 00:53:15.375]  Well, and it's cold.
[00:53:15.616 --> 00:53:17.879]  I don't have enough of your property.
[00:53:17.979 --> 00:53:22.304]  I want a little bit more, so they try different ways to plunder your property.
[00:53:22.965 --> 00:53:25.448]  And that's, in effect, what Cap and Trade's gonna do.
[00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:28.553]  And then look at government being the biggest polluter out there.
[00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:29.772]  Absolutely.
[00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:35.474]  I mean, this is, like, CPS is five to seven times more likely, depending on what state, to abuse your children.
[00:53:35.494 --> 00:53:38.735]  They're the most dangerous people out there, so they're the ones that watch the kids.
[00:53:38.775 --> 00:53:39.456]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:53:39.756 --> 00:53:43.017]  Every pedophile in the world wants to be a CPS worker.
[00:53:43.037 --> 00:53:44.457]  I mean, put two and two together, of course.
[00:53:44.817 --> 00:53:47.919]  Jay in Oregon, last caller for our guest, Wayne Paul, Ron Paul's brother.
[00:53:47.959 --> 00:53:48.259]  Go ahead.
[00:53:48.839 --> 00:53:49.199]  Hi, Wayne.
[00:53:49.599 --> 00:53:50.079]  Hi, Jay.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.001]  Actually, I've got two questions for you.
[00:53:54.021 --> 00:53:55.021]  Go ahead.
[00:53:56.021 --> 00:53:56.502]  Question one.
[00:53:58.208 --> 00:54:12.533]  How do you reconcile the cognitive dissonance of working to quell what you guys are calling the rise of the One World Government, One World Economy, One World Currency, when it's clear in the Word of God that this is going to happen?
[00:54:14.431 --> 00:54:15.851]  Yeah, it was clear in 70 A.D.
[00:54:16.032 --> 00:54:18.992]  they thought it was the end of the world when Jerusalem was sacked.
[00:54:19.032 --> 00:54:21.213]  They thought it was the end of the world when Hitler was killing people.
[00:54:21.233 --> 00:54:23.394]  You've got all these different empires.
[00:54:23.734 --> 00:54:31.096]  How do you reconcile in the word of God that it's our job to fight evil, whatever the cost may be?
[00:54:33.357 --> 00:54:36.718]  It's not to us to choose, it's us to do the right thing.
[00:54:38.278 --> 00:54:40.379]  Duty is ours, consequence belongs to God.
[00:54:40.399 --> 00:54:41.339]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[00:54:41.359 --> 00:54:42.840]  Or what are you getting at?
[00:54:43.516 --> 00:54:45.918]  Well, Alex, I know your position real well.
[00:54:45.958 --> 00:54:47.099]  I was asking Mr. Paul.
[00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:48.660]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.260]  We'll let you go.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.401]  Mr. Paul, go ahead.
[00:54:50.781 --> 00:54:51.182]  Okay.
[00:54:51.882 --> 00:55:04.751]  My answer to that question is it doesn't change my Christian obligation as to how I live and how I am a steward of the property I've been entrusted with.
[00:55:06.052 --> 00:55:11.316]  Regardless of what may be God's will, I have
[00:55:12.714 --> 00:55:37.809]  I have been instructed by the Word to live a life that is a stewardship life in terms of the property I have, in terms of the people I associate with, my peer group, and my responsibility is to do it according to God's Word, and God's going to take care of the rest of the thing.
[00:55:38.464 --> 00:55:39.904]  So I'm not going to worry about it.
[00:55:40.404 --> 00:55:49.386]  I still have to fight the battle that the Federal Reserve System is an evil system and needs to be abolished.
[00:55:50.306 --> 00:55:51.647]  It doesn't change the fact.
[00:55:51.707 --> 00:56:00.469]  It was the pastors that led the Revolutionary War against England and a few of the pastors did say it's God's will, lay down Romans 13 out of context.
[00:56:00.729 --> 00:56:02.429]  Look at the prophets, look at the whole Bible.
[00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:04.770]  It's about standing up against evil and fighting evil.
[00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:06.690]  Caller, does that answer your question Jay?
[00:56:07.918 --> 00:56:08.419]  It does enough.
[00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:09.039]  Thank you.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:09.940]  You bet.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:16.326]  I mean, these devil churches funded by the Rockefellers publicly, World Council of Churches, are telling people stand down.
[00:56:17.247 --> 00:56:19.369]  And, uh, it's incredible.
[00:56:19.529 --> 00:56:21.390]  Wayne Paul, amazing having you on.
[00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:21.871]  Thank you.
[00:56:22.832 --> 00:56:23.332]  Thank you.
[00:56:23.472 --> 00:56:24.273]  I appreciate it.
[00:56:24.814 --> 00:56:27.436]  We appreciate you being on, and he's in the Obama Deception, folks.
[00:56:27.656 --> 00:56:29.238]  Let me say bye to you during the break, Wayne.
[00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:30.579]  Stay with us.
[00:56:31.701 --> 00:56:37.263]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:56:37.563 --> 00:56:38.724]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:56:38.864 --> 00:56:42.825]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[00:56:43.145 --> 00:56:44.686]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:56:44.986 --> 00:56:51.289]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:56:52.429 --> 00:56:54.990]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:56.791]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:56:57.051 --> 00:56:59.832]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:57:00.052 --> 00:57:01.492]  And their formula really works.
[00:57:01.772 --> 00:57:04.313]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:57:04.593 --> 00:57:05.834]  Try the NutriCafe.
[00:57:06.074 --> 00:57:10.435]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:57:10.836 --> 00:57:13.036]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:57:13.256 --> 00:57:15.517]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:57:15.717 --> 00:57:17.458]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:57:17.818 --> 00:57:18.939]  Go to www.
[00:57:20.839 --> 00:57:23.161]  We're good to go.
[00:57:31.872 --> 00:57:36.876]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:57:37.076 --> 00:57:40.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:46.725]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:47.025 --> 00:57:51.889]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:52.089 --> 00:57:52.590]  Number three,
[00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:58.437]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:57:59.278 --> 00:58:01.941]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:58:02.182 --> 00:58:05.626]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:06.707 --> 00:58:10.332]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:58:10.552 --> 00:58:16.036]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:58:16.276 --> 00:58:20.840]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.521]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:22.761 --> 00:58:25.103]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[00:58:32.082 --> 00:58:34.843]  State of the economy is severely impacting your life.
[00:58:35.083 --> 00:58:38.445]  This might be some of the most important information you will ever hear.
[00:58:38.785 --> 00:58:46.489]  As the economy continues to spiral out of control, many people just like you wonder how they will support their family and pay their bills.
[00:58:46.769 --> 00:58:50.131]  The government is not going to help out the people who desperately need it.
[00:58:50.431 --> 00:58:52.892]  It's time for you to look outside the box and change
[00:58:52.892 --> 00:58:53.252]  We're good to go.
[00:59:19.381 --> 00:59:21.582]  Here's what you do to get here's what you do.

[00:59:41.692 --> 00:59:42.512]  You want answers?
[00:59:43.272 --> 00:59:44.153]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:44.613 --> 00:59:48.455]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:49.016 --> 00:59:53.138]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:54.138 --> 01:00:02.543]  Well, joining us from the United Kingdom are Rima Labo, Medical Doctor, Albert Installment III, General,
[01:00:04.188 --> 01:00:05.349]  Both of their bios are amazing.
[01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:06.269]  We've got 51 minutes with them.
[01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:18.275]  We're talking about the forced inoculation plans worldwide, level 6, what's really in the triple jab, the right of self-shielding, what that means, the new developments with the U.S.
[01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:28.479]  head science czar writing an internal government textbook, 1,100 pages, on how to carry out a world government eugenics extermination plan.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.421]  This is confirmation of everything we've reverse-engineered.
[01:00:33.183 --> 01:00:34.045]  State Department memorandum 200.
[01:00:34.346 --> 01:00:37.553]  United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 96.
[01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:40.459]  We have all the pieces.
[01:00:40.519 --> 01:00:42.583]  It's all stated, but this is all in one place.
[01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:50.244]  And it's just devastating because, you know, even though I know all this stuff, you don't want to believe they're actually doing it.
[01:00:50.304 --> 01:00:56.927]  Forced drugging, forced sterilization, forced abortion, drugs in the water, the food, genetically engineered to sterilize mammals.
[01:00:57.227 --> 01:00:57.787]  It's coming up.
[01:00:58.147 --> 01:01:01.429]  Major General Albert Burt Stubblebine, the third U.S.
[01:01:01.469 --> 01:01:03.310]  Army retired, graduate of U.S.
[01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:05.211]  Military Academy, West Point, class of 52.
[01:01:06.311 --> 01:01:08.172]  Who enjoyed a stinger 32-year career in U.S.
[01:01:08.272 --> 01:01:10.113]  Army during which he commanded soldiers at every level.
[01:01:10.454 --> 01:01:16.317]  After his retirement, he served as VP for Intelligence Systems with BDM, a major defense contractor.
[01:01:16.577 --> 01:01:19.759]  He's also taken a set of experiences and become involved in
[01:01:21.175 --> 01:01:26.418]  Leading Edge Medical Research and Development in collaboration with his wife, Rima E. Labo, MD.
[01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:32.121]  He is a long-term, way-out-of-the-box thinker who redesigned the U.S.
[01:01:32.201 --> 01:01:36.284]  Army's intelligence architecture while serving as the Commanding General of the U.S.
[01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:39.706]  Army Intelligence School and Center, and helped to define the requirements of the U.S.
[01:01:39.806 --> 01:01:40.006]  Army.
[01:01:40.526 --> 01:01:41.066]  That is correct.
[01:02:08.706 --> 01:02:12.410]  Okay, we're going to go to you in a second, sir, and we appreciate you joining us on the interview today.
[01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:22.521]  Let's go to your wife, the medical doctor first, in light of, give us your perspective, and then I want to get the General's perspective, on the Mass Eugenics Plan.
[01:02:22.581 --> 01:02:23.923]  We have right of self-defense.
[01:02:24.423 --> 01:02:29.665]  This is a government-level PhD textbook for government leaders, for policy.
[01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:31.426]  I've now read over 400 pages of the 1100.
[01:02:32.367 --> 01:02:33.167]  Total nightmare.
[01:02:33.227 --> 01:02:36.148]  Doctor, this is exactly what you've been saying for decades.
[01:02:36.708 --> 01:02:44.832]  Break down what this new development means, then we'll get the General's take, and then we'll expand out into what this flu vaccination means.
[01:02:46.173 --> 01:02:51.515]  I'm happy to do that, Alex, and I want you to know that both the General and I are
[01:02:52.222 --> 01:02:56.864]  Happy and privileged to have the opportunity to talk to you and your listeners about this.
[01:02:57.184 --> 01:03:01.666]  This is a critical time and the first thing I want to do is start at the very end.
[01:03:02.086 --> 01:03:13.671]  The very end is unless you, listeners, take action now, you will be faced with involuntary detention
[01:03:14.532 --> 01:03:14.672]  Okay.
[01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:43.518]  No recourse, no legal recourse, and you will have no financial recourse because vaccine makers are protected by the Fraud and Death Administration and by the spineless, worthless Congress of the United States.
[01:03:43.558 --> 01:03:46.799]  And if you'd like, later, Alex, I'll tell you how I feel about the Congress.
[01:03:47.559 --> 01:03:51.600]  Anyway, the point is that you have a moment now.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.561]  If you go to our website, which is healthfreedomusa.org.
[01:03:59.522 --> 01:04:00.602]  We're good to go.
[01:04:24.679 --> 01:04:29.444]  For the quarantine period and self-shield.
[01:04:29.944 --> 01:04:44.578]  Now, the best friend that Health Freedom has in the United States Congress is willing to take this onto the floor and create a bill and introduce a bill if there is enough support from all of us.
[01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:55.397]  So if ever you valued your freedom, if ever you valued your right to make your own health decisions, and if ever you distrusted the government, now is the time.
[01:04:55.457 --> 01:05:01.502]  Go to healthfreedomusa.org and click on the top action item.
[01:05:01.802 --> 01:05:08.728]  Because if you don't, you will be either mandatorily vaccinated or you will be incarcerated.
[01:05:08.808 --> 01:05:12.491]  And now to answer your question, Alex, because that's the bottom line,
[01:05:13.226 --> 01:05:31.594]  The answer is yes, the vaccine against this genetically engineered, weaponized H1N1 virus, which we are now being told, golly gee willikers, this resembles the 1918 swine flu pandemic virus.
[01:05:31.654 --> 01:05:41.779]  Well yes, of course it does, because the genes were introduced intentionally into this new virus when they fizzled after being introduced into the avian flu virus.
[01:05:42.279 --> 01:05:50.046]  So, now the vaccine will be a deadly, quote, remedy to get rid of a large number of us.
[01:05:50.146 --> 01:06:04.239]  And we're going, if we're sheeple, we're going to line up, roll up our sleeves, present our children for vaccination the way 40 million Americans did in 10 weeks during the swine flu debacle in 1976.
[01:06:07.569 --> 01:06:33.618]  Only this time they won't stop it after 10 weeks, because the intention, we firmly believe, based on Holder's document and on other information that we've been amassing for years, and we've been talking about you, and the General and I have had the chance to talk about it on this show and on others, and we've been writing about it for years, that you have, this time, the intention is to get rid of us.
[01:06:34.178 --> 01:06:35.098]  Profitably.
[01:06:35.599 --> 01:06:36.899]  The amount of money
[01:06:37.475 --> 01:06:47.725]  That is being poured into the coffers of the World Pharmaceutical Company is absolutely unholy, as is the intent.
[01:06:48.065 --> 01:07:03.179]  In fact, today, the World Health Organization put out, I'm sorry, yesterday, World Health Organization put out a press release saying that what we need for this and the coming pandemic, because remember Alex,
[01:07:03.837 --> 01:07:07.705]  This vaccine is not the last pandemic vaccine.
[01:07:07.745 --> 01:07:13.877]  It's the first of many, many, many, many horrors to come until they've gotten rid of all of us.
[01:07:14.554 --> 01:07:16.035]  This is what's needed.
[01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:17.896]  We need many new vaccines.
[01:07:17.936 --> 01:07:19.156]  We need new patents.
[01:07:19.236 --> 01:07:41.787]  We need new drugs because... Well, if you look how they ramp it up, they admittedly are testing global level six with all the major nation states under the direction of the World Health Organization, this global directorate, and so it's kind of like a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drill where they drill following orders and taking the poison and they admit... Well, I mean, you've looked at this, Doctor, and I want to get General Stubblebine's take on it.
[01:07:42.207 --> 01:07:43.288]  What is the history
[01:07:44.189 --> 01:07:46.091]  Actually, I believe the trials were done by Novartis.
[01:08:05.889 --> 01:08:23.097]  And I believe that they were in conjunction with Sinophia Ventis, the good people who manufactured an avian flu vaccine, which the United States bought a hundred million doses of in their first order, totally untested, untried, but approved by the FDA.
[01:08:23.277 --> 01:08:23.957]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:08:23.977 --> 01:08:27.458]  They're on our news here in Austin saying everybody's got to take the shot, get ready.
[01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:31.339]  They're on the news saying it will be mandatory coming up in the fall.
[01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:32.599]  It will be a pandemic.
[01:08:32.959 --> 01:08:34.239]  It will be mass death.
[01:08:34.599 --> 01:08:40.261]  And then people are lining up and they're saying, oh, we don't even know if this is the right thing and just taking the shot.
[01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:47.542]  What do we know from past operations, Dr. Labo and then General Stubblebine, about what they're putting in these vaccines?
[01:08:47.962 --> 01:08:49.342]  Well, they're putting adjuvants.
[01:08:49.723 --> 01:08:50.683]  Adjuvants are
[01:08:52.216 --> 01:08:52.717]  I think so.
[01:09:08.214 --> 01:09:08.594]  I don't
[01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:43.252]  And then this, according to other doctors we've had on, accelerates the allergies, the sicknesses, the cancers, and then makes your immune system go haywire.
[01:09:43.272 --> 01:09:44.213]  I want to talk about that more.
[01:09:44.473 --> 01:09:45.473]  We're about to go to break.
[01:09:45.893 --> 01:09:55.718]  But General Stubblebine, you were just on six, seven months ago before this whole flu thing came up, and you guys were talking about when they try to launch a pandemic, don't take the shot.
[01:09:57.017 --> 01:09:58.678]  What does this look like to you?
[01:09:59.579 --> 01:10:00.680]  Well, it's very clear.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:10.188]  You know, what Dr. Riva and I have been doing, Alex, has been watching very carefully a whole lot of information.
[01:10:10.628 --> 01:10:11.789]  And I call them dots.
[01:10:11.889 --> 01:10:13.731]  They're tidbits of information.
[01:10:14.151 --> 01:10:22.178]  But it's part of the way I have been trained from the intelligence world, or in the intelligence world, of how you put the picture together.
[01:10:22.558 --> 01:10:25.661]  And what you do is you take little bits of information,
[01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:37.347]  For instance, 11 people died instantaneously in a trial in Poland, and then 22 more died later from the same vaccine that you're about to take.
[01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:51.494]  And then you take the information about Baxter, which contaminated the vaccines for 22 different countries, or 18 different countries in Europe.
[01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:57.721]  You put all of these various dots together like that, and what you end up with is a picture.
[01:10:58.201 --> 01:11:11.717]  Suddenly the picture flies into your face, and you say, holy smokes, now I take this to the people who are called operational folks, because they're the people that do the planning of what you do about it.
[01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:22.679]  So, the intelligence piece of all of this has been creating this enormous picture that you now have seen the documentation for.
[01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:23.480]  Stay there.
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:24.821]  We gotta break, General.
[01:11:24.841 --> 01:11:26.162]  Please come right back with this.
[01:11:26.603 --> 01:11:28.364]  And we'll get the doctor's comments on this.
[01:11:29.045 --> 01:11:29.546]  Absolutely.
[01:11:29.566 --> 01:11:31.708]  We now have the full textbook on how they're gonna kill us.
[01:11:32.108 --> 01:11:38.930]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:55.195]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:11:55.435 --> 01:12:00.577]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:12:00.797 --> 01:12:07.084]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:10.968]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:12:11.228 --> 01:12:13.811]  Solar powered generators are finally available.
[01:12:13.911 --> 01:12:19.277]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:12:19.577 --> 01:12:22.179]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:12:22.259 --> 01:12:24.461]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:12:24.481 --> 01:12:26.943]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:12:26.983 --> 01:12:31.267]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:12:32.384 --> 01:12:37.689]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:45.176]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:12:45.776 --> 01:12:51.942]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:12:52.342 --> 01:12:54.183]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:12:54.323 --> 01:12:56.744]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:12:56.825 --> 01:13:07.750]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:13:08.411 --> 01:13:09.691]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:10.072 --> 01:13:11.452]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:13:11.933 --> 01:13:18.176]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:18.832 --> 01:13:26.604]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:27.105 --> 01:13:28.267]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:28.688 --> 01:13:29.869]  The people strike back!
[01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:31.910]  Good day.
[01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:33.532]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:13:33.712 --> 01:13:33.952]  July 16, 2009.
[01:13:34.012 --> 01:13:35.013]  Gold opened this morning at $940.
[01:13:35.053 --> 01:13:37.655]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $966.96, $4348 for a half-ounce, or $241.74 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:13:37.675 --> 01:13:38.255]  That's $966.96, $483.48, or $241.74.
[01:13:49.284 --> 01:13:53.086]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[01:13:53.246 --> 01:13:57.288]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[01:13:57.468 --> 01:14:01.950]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:07.512]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:10.814]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:15.716]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust, or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[01:14:15.816 --> 01:14:18.958]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[01:14:19.058 --> 01:14:23.721]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems?
[01:14:23.781 --> 01:14:25.583]  Or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[01:14:25.643 --> 01:14:26.923]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:46.216 --> 01:14:47.237]  Have a glass of water.
[01:14:47.757 --> 01:14:53.081]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:54.202]  Of course you can't.
[01:14:54.482 --> 01:14:59.306]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not take away from it.
[01:14:59.626 --> 01:15:07.852]  AirandAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these toxins.
[01:15:08.172 --> 01:15:19.958]  AirAndAqua.com carries whole house air and water purification systems, air conditioners, shower head filters, water testing kits, atmospheric water generators, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and much more.

[01:15:27.062 --> 01:15:29.163]  That's AirAndAqua.com.
[01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:30.724]  Purify your life today!
[01:15:36.707 --> 01:15:57.761]  Obama's science advisor called for a planetary regime to enforce totalitarian population control, forced sterilization, forced abortion, euthanasia,
[01:16:07.179 --> 01:16:09.780]  Of course, drugging of the water supply, implantable chips.
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:14.061]  And this is Obama's science advisor, General Stubblebine.
[01:16:14.561 --> 01:16:15.621]  Intelligence expert.
[01:16:16.122 --> 01:16:18.962]  Continuing, you got interrupted by the satellite, break their head to take it.
[01:16:19.303 --> 01:16:21.023]  Continuing with the intelligence.
[01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:27.105]  You're saying, you can see the history of the vaccine, the history of what they've done over and over again, the fear-mongering.
[01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:30.426]  And so it's not the flu you worry about, it's the shot.
[01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:30.926]  Continue.
[01:16:31.533 --> 01:16:33.035]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:16:33.435 --> 01:16:41.383]  And as you begin to, as this picture suddenly pops into your face, Alex, you suddenly say, holy smokes!
[01:16:41.824 --> 01:16:43.005]  You know, I knew it was bad.
[01:16:43.025 --> 01:16:45.027]  I did not know it was that bad.
[01:16:45.507 --> 01:16:49.111]  Now, though, it's time to take action because you now know.
[01:16:49.411 --> 01:16:51.894]  And oh, by the way, the book that you've just gotten is
[01:16:53.035 --> 01:16:59.238]  Your confirmation that everything that we've been saying for months and months and months and months is absolutely true.
[01:16:59.738 --> 01:17:03.780]  And oh by the way, during those months and months and months, people were saying we're crazy.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:04.660]  We're done.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:05.201]  We're off the wall.
[01:17:05.261 --> 01:17:09.323]  And that we work for Big Pharma and that we're CIA agents, yadda yadda yadda yadda.
[01:17:09.603 --> 01:17:14.305]  The fact is they didn't want to hear what we were saying or they were on the other side.
[01:17:14.785 --> 01:17:15.425]  Ignore them.
[01:17:15.445 --> 01:17:16.886]  The facts are the facts.
[01:17:19.736 --> 01:17:21.097]  That's how COINTELPRO works.
[01:17:21.978 --> 01:17:23.579]  They can't believe we have a Ron Paul.
[01:17:23.619 --> 01:17:25.280]  They can't believe we have a General Stubblebine.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:30.663]  They can't believe that there's good people from powerful positions that are stepping up.
[01:17:32.384 --> 01:17:33.805]  That's what COINTELPRO does.
[01:17:34.305 --> 01:17:36.347]  Regardless, we're putting out the facts.
[01:17:36.367 --> 01:17:37.507]  We're doing the best we can.
[01:17:37.747 --> 01:17:40.249]  People can listen or they can go ahead and take the shots.
[01:17:40.762 --> 01:17:48.965]  No, but at this stage of the game, they better goddamn listen, otherwise, excuse my language, but they better listen, otherwise, they're going to be in deep trouble!
[01:17:49.366 --> 01:17:58.590]  You have now seen, for a fact, I mean you've believed all along, Alex, now you understand exactly because you've seen the document!
[01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:02.451]  You've seen the blueprint for what all of this is about!
[01:18:02.771 --> 01:18:06.153]  Let me read to you the CDC assumptions.
[01:18:06.833 --> 01:18:09.195]  That they're basing their targeting on, okay?
[01:18:09.795 --> 01:18:14.118]  They say, one, severity of illness is unchanged from that which has already been observed.
[01:18:14.418 --> 01:18:23.683]  Well, they're also predicting, and this is just nonsense, they're also predicting that it's going to get a whole lot worse, which is why, after all, we need the vaccinations.
[01:18:23.863 --> 01:18:29.707]  Yeah, they're saying for sure, they know this, but with regular flu, they go, a million Americans have it, like we're all going to die.
[01:18:29.907 --> 01:18:32.169]  That just means we have the virus, no big deal.
[01:18:32.389 --> 01:18:34.870]  They're clearly engaged in lying and fear-mongering.
[01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.971]  The question is why?
[01:18:37.043 --> 01:18:55.412]  Well, the answer is very simple, because the WHO has said for decades, and the United States government has accepted for decades, that their first priority for a, quote, sustainable planet is the same as the Illuminati and Bilderberger agenda, which is massive depopulation.
[01:18:56.172 --> 01:18:57.353]  The Georgia Guidestones
[01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:59.154]  Pretty well say it all.
[01:18:59.194 --> 01:19:00.155]  I don't know who put them up.
[01:19:00.255 --> 01:19:01.436]  I don't know what their deal was.
[01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:07.361]  But they do want to reduce the population by a minimum of 80% and a maximum of 90%.
[01:19:08.081 --> 01:19:13.746]  That means 9 out of every 10 humans on the planet is slated to go.
[01:19:13.826 --> 01:19:19.651]  But as long as we're going, they say, why don't we just pump untold
[01:19:20.391 --> 01:19:30.815]  Amounts of the remaining money, such as it is, the worthless money that's been degraded by the, if you will, the economic pandemic that's been engineered.
[01:19:31.275 --> 01:19:42.599]  Why don't we just pump all the remaining money into their hands through the diseases that they will cause and through the unbelievable amount of money that these vaccines are generating?
[01:19:42.799 --> 01:19:44.560]  Well, Doctor, we've got a long segment coming up.
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:50.624]  This was the short one, so we've got plenty of time for both you and General Stubblebine to break this down and what you're recommending we do and how we get this to the floor.
[01:19:51.185 --> 01:19:59.410]  You know, to say, look, we're not going to take forced injections because under the executive order that they've activated, as you know, the public may not.
[01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:04.634]  They're now saying forced inoculations under level six, quarantining, lockdown, basically code red.
[01:20:04.854 --> 01:20:10.518]  But General, briefly, a lot of the experts I've talked to, but you've been the former head of major intelligence divisions of the Army,
[01:20:11.218 --> 01:20:13.819]  And really wrote the book on a lot of the systems we see today.
[01:20:14.479 --> 01:20:26.641]  Looking at this, most experts I talked to said they won't want to kill most people right away with the shot, that it'll have a bad effect on some and the soft kill will be an immediate kill with some, as we saw with trials in Poland and other areas.
[01:20:27.761 --> 01:20:37.803]  But a lot of experts are saying buy an airy weapon, for those that don't know, meaning this gives you half of it, they then trigger through water or air, something else later.
[01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:42.523]  You know, we know pieces of what are in the vaccine.
[01:20:42.884 --> 01:20:46.865]  We absolutely do not know the entire menu that's in that vaccine.
[01:20:47.446 --> 01:21:08.094]  One thing is for sure, you can rest assured since this vaccine is being put there on purpose to give you as an excuse to give you the shot, you know that what's going to be in there and what's going to be in your body is not going to fit your body very nicely.
[01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:09.014]  Stay there.
[01:21:09.094 --> 01:21:10.895]  Stay there, doctor.
[01:21:10.915 --> 01:21:11.355]  We got a break.
[01:21:11.395 --> 01:21:12.195]  Long segment coming up.
[01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:12.896]  General, stay there.
[01:21:13.716 --> 01:21:14.376]  Absolutely.
[01:21:14.896 --> 01:21:20.458]  And a lot of experts we've talked to, genetic engineers, say a lot of these cancer viruses they implant trigger later.
[01:21:22.159 --> 01:21:23.059]  We're on the march.
[01:21:23.559 --> 01:21:25.160]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.761]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:31.564 --> 01:21:32.665]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:21:32.946 --> 01:21:34.728]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:21:34.948 --> 01:21:35.569]  Well, you should.
[01:21:35.589 --> 01:21:40.154]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:21:40.414 --> 01:21:40.895]  That's right.

[01:21:52.588 --> 01:21:58.210]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:21:58.571 --> 01:22:05.093]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:22:05.454 --> 01:22:10.636]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:22:10.976 --> 01:22:12.117]  This is real.

[01:22:31.903 --> 01:22:33.485]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:33.605 --> 01:22:38.251]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:22:38.352 --> 01:22:41.095]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:22:41.295 --> 01:22:44.179]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:49.086]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:22:49.286 --> 01:22:50.227]  If you simply prepare.
[01:22:50.407 --> 01:22:53.371]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:22:53.671 --> 01:23:00.559]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:23:54.946 --> 01:23:55.866]  We're good to go.
[01:24:20.259 --> 01:24:20.660]  We're good.
[01:24:50.032 --> 01:24:55.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a game or a joke that General Stubblebine was just saying.
[01:24:56.259 --> 01:25:02.164]  Okay, we've got General Stubblebine and his wife, Doctor...
[01:25:03.487 --> 01:25:05.369]  Rima Lebo, you've got the floor here.
[01:25:05.929 --> 01:25:08.771]  Continue breaking down then, because you got interrupted by some breaks.
[01:25:09.392 --> 01:25:13.876]  Start over, break down the intelligence we have on these vaccines, what we know.
[01:25:13.896 --> 01:25:20.681]  I mean, it's just like Gardasil at Middle East, killing a whole bunch of women and girls, having weird autoimmune diseases with the others.
[01:25:20.721 --> 01:25:24.584]  We're almost like Ebola, where blood's coming out of all these orifices.
[01:25:25.165 --> 01:25:28.348]  It's paralyzing people, and it's like they're testing soft kills.
[01:25:28.968 --> 01:25:31.990]  Testing the media's response, testing the public.
[01:25:32.010 --> 01:25:41.554]  I don't know what you'd call that, General, in a military fashion, but just like before they invaded Panama, they would have the helicopters land and do drills for six months to where they were acclimated.
[01:25:42.115 --> 01:25:47.377]  So they just acclimate us now to the ambient soft kill, silent weapons, quiet wars.
[01:25:47.397 --> 01:25:54.221]  Let's get the General's take on that and then the doctor breaking down what she sees happening here, how we get Congress to say no
[01:25:54.781 --> 01:25:56.843]  And to, like, override the executive order?
[01:25:56.863 --> 01:25:59.186]  Because they've now engaged Level 6.
[01:26:00.047 --> 01:26:01.368]  The question is, will they implement?
[01:26:01.648 --> 01:26:13.801]  So, General, what do you call this soft-kill system where they're increasing the deadliness of the vaccines, openly killing us, death to the left, death to the right, and everyone just marching and injecting their children?
[01:26:14.724 --> 01:26:26.647]  Well, I'm not sure that I know the military terminology for this kind of soft kill, but it's like guerrilla warfare because it's...
[01:26:27.839 --> 01:26:29.139]  Kind of behind the scenes.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.180]  It's hidden.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:38.461]  You know, if you're doing guerrilla warfare, you cannot go out into the middle of the street with your gun.
[01:26:38.962 --> 01:26:41.142]  You do it from an ambush position.
[01:26:41.562 --> 01:26:42.882]  So it's always hidden.
[01:26:43.302 --> 01:26:50.384]  Well, there's not any difference between what is happening now and guerrilla warfare against all populations.
[01:26:50.404 --> 01:26:53.185]  That's exactly what's happening, Alex.
[01:26:53.605 --> 01:26:54.085]  Go ahead.
[01:26:55.425 --> 01:27:02.407]  No, you can just see them rolling out the total PSYOP for a non-event flu and then now saying we're all basically dead in the fall.
[01:27:02.708 --> 01:27:09.050]  Take the shot with their history of radiating foster children, black men and syphilis, Project Shad.
[01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:12.311]  How would anyone in their right mind take anything they try to give us?
[01:27:12.571 --> 01:27:14.072]  They're not in their right mind, Alex.
[01:27:14.452 --> 01:27:19.614]  They've been propagandized, they've been fluoridated, they've been controlled.
[01:27:19.694 --> 01:27:25.736]  What percentage of the American population is on psychoactive medication and on electroshock therapy?
[01:27:26.276 --> 01:27:30.958]  It's horrendously high and that means that people can be controlled.
[01:27:30.998 --> 01:27:35.239]  That's part of the soft kill and it's been going on for a long, long time.
[01:27:35.299 --> 01:27:41.782]  I want to remind people that the very first vaccine, Edward Jenner's vaccine for smallpox,
[01:27:42.282 --> 01:28:10.297]  was literally a vaccine for syphilis because it spread syphilis and by the mid 19th century the British Parliament which had made mandatory vaccination a law for every citizen and every resident of the British Empire discovered that they had created a syphilis epidemic so they did an investigation they held an inquiry and they discovered that they had two choices choice one
[01:28:10.917 --> 01:28:11.377]  Admit it!
[01:28:11.838 --> 01:28:26.805]  They would have egg all over their faces and take responsibility for the fact that they had killed and named and sentenced to death millions of people through this hastily entered into scientific fraud which is what vaccination is or
[01:28:27.165 --> 01:28:30.446]  Wasn't that just a Malthusian first round of eugenics through Mr. Galton?
[01:28:52.785 --> 01:29:08.068]  No, I believe that in fact this was a colossal, stupendous stupidity on the part of the British Parliament and that they chose to save their own egos and careers rather than back down from the position they had climbed onto.
[01:29:08.088 --> 01:29:09.669]  Well look at the 76 swine flu.
[01:29:10.109 --> 01:29:13.289]  This always breaks out, the 1918, the 1976, it's always breaking out at military bases.
[01:29:17.265 --> 01:29:21.146]  Oddly enough, where our soldiers are our guinea pigs.
[01:29:21.246 --> 01:29:32.529]  Guess who gets to hold up their arm and unclothe their arm and stand there and stick it out so that somebody will stick a needle in it?
[01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:34.430]  And they have no choice.
[01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:49.612]  Same with Vaccine A. I want to point out that the same information that Gary Matsumoto so beautifully brought forward in his Vaccine A and the subtitle of that book was why the United States is
[01:29:50.452 --> 01:29:53.854]  ...experimenting on the military and why they won't be the last.
[01:29:54.315 --> 01:29:56.876]  He talked about squalene adjuvants.
[01:29:57.356 --> 01:30:04.280]  He talked about introducing oils that irritate the immune system so they make more antibodies.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:13.686]  That means the expensive part of the vaccine, the antigen, can be in much, much, much smaller proportions so it's more profitable for the company.
[01:30:14.126 --> 01:30:16.968]  And then you make more antigens.
[01:30:17.392 --> 01:30:21.215]  That means that you have a higher antigen titer in your body.
[01:30:21.475 --> 01:30:25.559]  So it's that accelerant that triggers the autoimmune response you're saying.
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:35.127]  The other medical doctors we've had on have said that's the thing that's causing a lot of the autism, not even the mercury, is that it causes that brain swelling that then causes brain damage.
[01:30:35.147 --> 01:30:36.948]  Correctly, but there's another part to this.
[01:30:37.449 --> 01:30:43.554]  No one, and I say this as a scientist and as a physician, no one has ever proven
[01:30:44.537 --> 01:30:55.265]  In any clinical trial whatsoever, that that high titer, that high level of antibodies is related in any way with immunity to the disease.
[01:30:55.865 --> 01:30:56.085]  Ever.
[01:30:56.105 --> 01:30:59.588]  So this whole thing is pointless, you understand?
[01:30:59.668 --> 01:31:01.269]  It's quackery, it's quackery.
[01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:02.110]  Total quackery.
[01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:06.393]  Okay, doctor and general, from a military perspective, intelligence perspective, from a medical doctor perspective,
[01:31:07.799 --> 01:31:12.120]  You've got all these deaths all over Europe and Asia in swine flu and bird flu trials.
[01:31:12.841 --> 01:31:15.161]  High death rates where they inject a hundred people in it.
[01:31:15.502 --> 01:31:16.922]  You know, a whole bunch of them drop dead.
[01:31:16.982 --> 01:31:19.083]  We've been putting mainstream news articles on screen.
[01:31:19.383 --> 01:31:20.903]  And then the media is very quiet.
[01:31:21.143 --> 01:31:25.925]  The government even indicts people who gave the shots, saying they were paid by pharmaceutical companies.
[01:31:26.165 --> 01:31:27.846]  But then we can't ever find who they are.
[01:31:28.766 --> 01:31:31.308]  And then we've got Baxter involved in the new vaccine.
[01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:32.129]  They're involved.
[01:31:32.189 --> 01:31:34.450]  I mean, what does this look like to you?
[01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:39.574]  And then how are you coming out and saying, look out with this next flu shot that's coming out?
[01:31:40.715 --> 01:31:43.537]  Um, it looks... No, let me add to that first.
[01:31:43.837 --> 01:31:44.317]  Okay, General.
[01:31:44.698 --> 01:31:45.278]  I'll tell you what.
[01:31:45.719 --> 01:31:47.060]  It looks like an ambush.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:54.365]  You know, if you're in a city or a town and you're going door to door,
[01:31:55.044 --> 01:32:00.527]  In fighting, you never know where the ambush is going to come from.
[01:32:00.607 --> 01:32:04.969]  Is it going to come from a roof, from a window, from a door, from behind a door?
[01:32:05.289 --> 01:32:06.129]  You don't know.
[01:32:06.729 --> 01:32:18.695]  And this whole thing, Alex, to me, looks exactly like that door-to-door fighting in towns called ambush.
[01:32:19.557 --> 01:32:20.099]  Ambush.
[01:32:20.239 --> 01:32:21.101]  That's what it is.
[01:32:21.141 --> 01:32:25.631]  But this time the ambush is by our own forces against our own people.
[01:32:26.035 --> 01:32:28.436]  Well, we can see that the whole thing's engineered.
[01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:36.138]  We can see it's all hype, and the vaccine's deadly, and they admit won't even protect you from it, and normally, flus mutate into something less harmful or harmless.
[01:32:36.418 --> 01:32:40.439]  How are they saying 100% it's going to mutate deadly in the fall?
[01:32:40.459 --> 01:32:41.599]  Now, we're not saying that's going to happen.
[01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:42.179]  They're saying it.
[01:32:42.539 --> 01:32:49.441]  I mean, for anybody with a scientific background, doctor, in general, it's 101 that they can't say they know it's going to be deadly.
[01:32:49.661 --> 01:32:53.863]  That clearly is a lie, so it means that they know something we don't know.
[01:32:53.903 --> 01:32:55.203]  Are they going to release something else?
[01:32:55.874 --> 01:32:59.875]  It's a lie unless they know something that has never been told to the public.
[01:33:00.055 --> 01:33:04.016]  Well, now, I want to avoid giving these idiots too much credit.
[01:33:04.876 --> 01:33:05.836]  SARS fizzled.
[01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:07.837]  Avian flu fizzled.
[01:33:08.457 --> 01:33:11.637]  The pandemic swine flu fizzled.
[01:33:11.938 --> 01:33:18.299]  They may or may not be able to get the next generation of this
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:24.841]  This virus, this genetically engineered virus, to do what they want, which is kill lots of us.
[01:33:24.921 --> 01:33:30.563]  But it doesn't matter because they've got the vaccine, which is much more direct, much more effective.
[01:33:30.843 --> 01:33:32.023]  Now, listen up, folks.
[01:33:32.083 --> 01:33:32.903]  Which is the ambush?
[01:33:33.303 --> 01:33:34.223]  Which is the ambush.
[01:33:34.343 --> 01:33:45.226]  If a single person, and by the way, let me reiterate, I was starting to read this before, the first target is children from kindergarten to twelfth grade.
[01:33:45.926 --> 01:33:48.747]  The second target is pregnant women.
[01:33:48.768 --> 01:33:54.610]  The third target is adults between 45 and 65.
[01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:59.172]  That's the most productive segment of the workforce.
[01:33:59.553 --> 01:34:03.995]  These are the people who are going to receive the vaccines, and there are many of them.
[01:34:04.435 --> 01:34:06.696]  Just to back you up, we're putting it on screen, Doctor.
[01:34:07.717 --> 01:34:08.717]  She's not just saying this.
[01:34:08.777 --> 01:34:12.339]  The news has announced children first, then the elderly, then the sick.
[01:34:12.719 --> 01:34:14.120]  These are the most vulnerable.
[01:34:15.998 --> 01:34:17.399]  Go ahead, I'm gonna... Go ahead.
[01:34:26.829 --> 01:34:40.220]  Gardasil does what I believe Gardasil does and Cervavax, which is the British equivalent of Gardasil, which is about to be also approved in the United States shortly.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:46.266]  If these two vaccines do what I believe, which is render girls infertile,
[01:34:46.946 --> 01:35:09.313]  There's no reason to believe, oh yes, there's no reason to believe that this new vaccine, for which Baxter applied for the patent in 2007, by the way, so this surprise rush to get things on the street, so to speak, is total hype and nonsense, because they've been preparing this since 2007.
[01:35:12.114 --> 01:35:27.763]  It does the same thing and it contains one of the same ingredients Tween 80 which is very similar to polysorbate 80 and both of them injected cause infertility and what we have is not only death
[01:35:28.303 --> 01:35:32.486]  But an end of whatever race you happen to belong to, whatever ethnic group.
[01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:33.827]  Let me stop you.
[01:35:33.867 --> 01:35:38.590]  Doctor, my gut from all these hundreds of pieces that the General talks about is sterilization.
[01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:50.978]  Because that's in the State Department memorandum 200, that's in the White House, Czar's internal textbook plan report, and we know with the tetanus shots in Africa, Asia, and India, they got caught in the mid-90s.
[01:35:51.198 --> 01:35:52.639]  This is mainstream news for those that don't know.
[01:35:52.659 --> 01:35:53.140]  I know you know.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:07.651]  Adding a hormone to the tetanus shot to then cause an autoimmune response to that hormone and then basically sterilize women by abortion, where every time they get pregnant the baby dies second trimester from that hormone situation.
[01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:19.521]  And by the way, that same system which was created by the World Health Organization through its task force on female sterilization through inoculation, that
[01:36:20.071 --> 01:36:28.324]  The same substance is available as a one-year birth control shot for women and girls in the United States.
[01:36:28.805 --> 01:36:29.987]  Just thought I'd throw that in.
[01:36:31.556 --> 01:36:32.917]  Well, I've seen U.S.
[01:36:32.957 --> 01:36:36.700]  programs and TV ads where they tell girls get your tetanus shot.
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:37.901]  It's obvious.
[01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:55.354]  I mean, Dr., I want you to keep breaking down the math and the science and the facts and the key, pens and paper ready, the websites for folks so people can get involved with Congress saying, now, we're not going to quarantine, we're not taking your shots, let us stay in our homes, don't make the Army drag us off.
[01:36:55.614 --> 01:36:59.257]  But, General, speaking to the military and the police, back in 2002 with the
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.121]  Milo State's Health Emergency Powers Act.
[01:37:03.161 --> 01:37:08.044]  You know they ordered first responders to take it and the news reported LA Times over 99% said no.
[01:37:08.064 --> 01:37:09.565]  So the military and police aren't stupid.
[01:37:09.886 --> 01:37:12.467]  They even had bases saying no even though they were ordering them to.
[01:37:12.808 --> 01:37:16.950]  But the firemen, the police, the doctors, Tommy Thompson said no.
[01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:20.413]  Health and Human Services said... I mean the basic psychology.
[01:37:20.913 --> 01:37:22.114]  This attacks all of us.
[01:37:22.154 --> 01:37:24.796]  It's a very tiny eugenicist elite doing this.
[01:37:25.736 --> 01:37:28.298]  So we need to get the message out to the enforcers too.
[01:37:28.658 --> 01:37:30.279]  Why would they want to serve this evil?
[01:37:32.301 --> 01:37:38.245]  I mean, can you comment to this phenomenon of the very people being killed by this are the very ones that are going to be enforcing it?
[01:37:39.566 --> 01:37:50.493]  Well, a lot of that is simply because once you enter into the military, you know, the answer is yes sir, yes sir, no sir, yes sir.
[01:37:51.254 --> 01:37:54.636]  And everybody does exactly what they're told to do.
[01:37:55.136 --> 01:38:00.200]  So if the people at the very, very top know, but the people
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.321]  It's very, very difficult to
[01:38:22.954 --> 01:38:27.497]  Also, then go to the internet, go to the... it's not in the papers.
[01:38:27.957 --> 01:38:29.838]  So where do they get their information?
[01:38:30.338 --> 01:38:34.080]  They've got to wake up almost all by themselves.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.121]  It's a very difficult thing to do.
[01:38:36.562 --> 01:38:51.410]  And the people who are putting out the information, Alex, and there's a small community of us, are attacked by this COINTELPRO nonsense, and then people who want to do the right thing, who want to inform themselves, say, well, I better stay away from him, I better stay away from her,
[01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:52.810]  I better stay away from them.
[01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:54.391]  That's done to destroy our community.
[01:38:54.431 --> 01:39:00.573]  The last thing the New Order would do would be to have you guys out putting out nothing but accurate info and warning people.
[01:39:00.613 --> 01:39:05.534]  They would have you out saying it wasn't true and again they do this to balkanize us.
[01:39:05.554 --> 01:39:07.075]  They do this to break up our base.
[01:39:07.315 --> 01:39:12.537]  I have a 2004 Army manual that's declassified on how to do this to indigenous groups.
[01:39:13.217 --> 01:39:13.817]  Exactly.
[01:39:14.177 --> 01:39:19.979]  Now I want to give you the action step and if you don't take this and if you don't
[01:39:20.738 --> 01:39:24.581]  Uh, uh, viralize it, and this is the helpful side of viralization.
[01:39:24.601 --> 01:39:26.422]  Viral spread of the info, yeah.
[01:39:50.618 --> 01:39:51.679]  Act now.
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:53.601]  Click on the first button.
[01:39:53.681 --> 01:40:01.609]  Tell legislators you want the right to self-quarantine, not forced vaccinations and not forced incarceration.
[01:40:02.050 --> 01:40:02.590]  Take that.
[01:40:02.951 --> 01:40:08.176]  Every member of your family gets to send in one of those action items.
[01:40:08.276 --> 01:40:10.278]  If your kids are too young, fill in their names.
[01:40:10.358 --> 01:40:11.199]  That's legitimate.
[01:40:11.889 --> 01:40:19.054]  What's happening is that Congress is getting bombarded with hundreds of thousands of these, and so is every state legislator in the country.
[01:40:19.174 --> 01:40:20.956]  But we need millions, not hundreds of thousands.
[01:40:21.016 --> 01:40:22.857]  Millions, not hundreds of thousands.
[01:40:22.917 --> 01:40:25.639]  And what this is saying is, oh no you don't.
[01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:27.060]  This is pushback.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:34.606]  Because remember, a lot of state legislators and a lot of congressmen don't have the information you do.
[01:40:35.046 --> 01:40:41.169]  So instead of arguing with them about vaccines are good, vaccines are bad, the WHO is the new world order, forget that.
[01:40:41.509 --> 01:40:44.271]  What we're saying is, I want a third pass.
[01:40:44.491 --> 01:40:46.352]  Pass one, take the shot.
[01:40:46.732 --> 01:40:51.734]  Pass two, accept incarceration in state or federal facilities.
[01:40:51.874 --> 01:40:56.116]  Pass three, I go into my house, I shut the door, I stay there.
[01:40:56.217 --> 01:40:57.857]  And yeah, the kids might get bored.
[01:40:57.917 --> 01:40:59.158]  Get them some extra books.
[01:41:00.399 --> 01:41:03.486]  The last place you want to go during a pandemic is some big mass camp.
[01:41:09.378 --> 01:41:12.640]  Absolutely, we absolutely want to stay out of them!
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:31.689]  Now let me take you back to the videos of the 500,000, which is only a small part, the 500,000 three-person disposable caskets that are stockpiled outside of Atlanta, and we know that they're stockpiled in Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Colorado, they're everywhere.
[01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:46.665]  Right now, let me take you back to the mass grave sites which have been purchased and are being prepared in upstate New York and in virtually every... No, we got the official state documents telling the cemeteries, don't tell anybody.
[01:41:47.105 --> 01:41:49.428]  Can you bury 200,000 people on your little plot?
[01:41:49.448 --> 01:41:50.449]  We have the document.
[01:41:50.729 --> 01:41:52.690]  And you won't even get your own coffin!
[01:41:52.811 --> 01:41:55.532]  And now ask yourself, what's that for?
[01:41:55.733 --> 01:41:58.294]  Is that when I die from the vaccine?
[01:41:58.635 --> 01:42:01.497]  Is that when I die from the secondary soft kill?
[01:42:01.757 --> 01:42:08.842]  Because a lot of these vaccines are being produced on simian cells that we know contain leukemia viruses.
[01:42:10.147 --> 01:42:10.888]  Is that what you want?
[01:42:10.908 --> 01:42:15.390]  Just like SV40, they admitted it had cancer viruses and over 100 million Americans got it.
[01:42:15.851 --> 01:42:16.731]  This is unbelievable.
[01:42:16.771 --> 01:42:19.433]  General Stubblebine's our guest, Dr. Lebo's our guest.
[01:42:19.853 --> 01:42:21.054]  This is just blowing me away.
[01:42:21.294 --> 01:42:25.257]  And they're openly announcing mass graves, martial law.
[01:42:25.277 --> 01:42:26.397]  It doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[01:42:27.158 --> 01:42:28.519]  This could just be a beta test.
[01:42:28.539 --> 01:42:30.320]  We've got to take it very, very serious.
[01:42:35.023 --> 01:42:39.068]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[01:42:39.548 --> 01:42:42.492]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.

[01:42:52.927 --> 01:43:04.456]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[01:43:04.756 --> 01:43:07.598]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.

[01:43:24.683 --> 01:43:26.184]  It is a big idea.
[01:43:26.244 --> 01:43:26.884]  A new world order.
[01:43:26.904 --> 01:43:28.004]  In the near future.
[01:43:38.886 --> 01:43:41.448]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:43:41.948 --> 01:43:44.750]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:47.011]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:43:47.571 --> 01:43:50.013]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:43:50.753 --> 01:43:58.138]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:06.063]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:44:06.525 --> 01:44:10.028]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:44:10.408 --> 01:44:12.890]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:44:12.970 --> 01:44:14.111]  Most people have no idea.
[01:44:14.131 --> 01:44:14.912]  They're not after money.
[01:44:14.932 --> 01:44:15.992]  They have all the money they need.
[01:44:16.213 --> 01:44:16.933]  They're after power.
[01:44:17.173 --> 01:44:18.034]  That's what they're after.

[01:44:29.843 --> 01:44:30.984]  You have been warned.
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:35.842]  Berkey water systems are the most trusted name in water filtration available on the market.

[01:44:53.271 --> 01:44:57.953]  They also reduce nitrates, nitrites, sediment, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury.

[01:45:13.722 --> 01:45:17.323]  That's right, free shipping and three sport Berkey water bottles, an $89 value,
[01:45:18.504 --> 01:45:19.565]  I'm gonna do 10 minutes of overdrive.
[01:45:19.585 --> 01:45:20.526]  I just decided to do it.
[01:45:43.097 --> 01:45:44.278]  For the sake of getting truth out, you got it!
[01:45:44.298 --> 01:45:45.119]  You bet your bottom dollar!
[01:45:45.159 --> 01:45:48.361]  And I want to share something with you that just came into my email box, Alex.
[01:46:10.686 --> 01:46:24.453]  It seems that there is a health reform bill, a health care bill, which will fund state vaccine teams to conduct interventions, quote-unquote, in private homes.
[01:46:25.094 --> 01:46:28.395]  Now this bill says that it will
[01:46:30.026 --> 01:46:30.426]  I'm good.
[01:46:46.494 --> 01:46:47.535]  Yes, here's the article.
[01:46:47.555 --> 01:46:50.395]  They're now going to send CPS to adult and children's homes.
[01:46:50.775 --> 01:46:51.756]  Cyber News Service.
[01:46:51.836 --> 01:46:52.556]  Very credible.
[01:46:52.856 --> 01:46:54.096]  They have links to the documents.
[01:46:54.156 --> 01:46:54.956]  Zoom in on this.
[01:46:55.316 --> 01:46:56.997]  This ties into the FEMA camp bill.
[01:46:57.837 --> 01:46:59.077]  Zoom in on this for folks.
[01:46:59.117 --> 01:46:59.997]  I meant to get to this.
[01:47:00.017 --> 01:47:02.038]  This is the type of news I have stacked up.
[01:47:02.058 --> 01:47:04.818]  This is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:47:05.319 --> 01:47:06.619]  Healthcare bill.
[01:47:07.279 --> 01:47:11.582]  We'll fund state vaccine teams to conduct interventions in private homes.
[01:47:11.602 --> 01:47:16.426]  So they're now preparing to make everything mandatory, just like Rick Perry saying it's the law.
[01:47:16.746 --> 01:47:22.270]  You've got to take Gardasil when it killed a bunch of girls and women in the trials and is still killing people.
[01:47:22.610 --> 01:47:27.414]  General Stubblebine, in plain view, they're now making people take things that kill them.
[01:47:29.862 --> 01:47:36.529]  Well, the answer to that is yes, and look at all of the soldiers who step up in the line and say, yeah, shoot me.
[01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:39.772]  You know, shoot me with a shot or shoot me with a shotgun.
[01:47:39.932 --> 01:47:42.235]  And once again get court-martialed if they don't.
[01:47:42.635 --> 01:47:43.997]  I'm going to say it again, Alex.
[01:47:44.717 --> 01:47:48.220]  Listen, folks, get a pen, get a pencil.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:59.087]  If you're on the internet right now, type in to the address bar www.healthfreedomusa.org.
[01:47:59.207 --> 01:48:02.490]  Healthfreedomusa.org.
[01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:04.611]  You'll see Act Now.
[01:48:05.112 --> 01:48:12.637]  Click on the first item to tell people who can make the difference, who can respond to your pushback,
[01:48:13.057 --> 01:48:13.557]  Absolutely yes!
[01:48:13.577 --> 01:48:13.877]  Absolutely!
[01:48:39.275 --> 01:48:39.896]  Absolutely.
[01:48:40.236 --> 01:48:50.824]  They find, incidentally, I had forgotten for a moment the fact that they know where every door is, where every family lives, so they can go to that door.
[01:48:51.264 --> 01:48:59.110]  If you've decided not to take a shot, they can go knock on your door and say, well, now just give me your arm here.
[01:48:59.170 --> 01:48:59.731]  Let me explain that
[01:49:02.993 --> 01:49:04.974]  They have targeted children first.
[01:49:05.034 --> 01:49:14.341]  Let me also remind you, and you may be one of the people who actually had this happen, that the CDC has been calling people.
[01:49:14.361 --> 01:49:17.383]  The CDC is a unit of the Health and Human Services.
[01:49:17.403 --> 01:49:18.303]  Yeah, we confirmed that.
[01:49:18.443 --> 01:49:19.904]  Asking if their vaccines are up to date.
[01:49:19.924 --> 01:49:24.367]  I'm getting all these calls from listeners and I googled it and I saw a news article where they are calling.
[01:49:25.948 --> 01:49:27.309]  It's actually happening.
[01:49:27.329 --> 01:49:27.669]  Stay there.
[01:49:27.689 --> 01:49:29.010]  We're talking about we're going to overdrive.
[01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:31.432]  It's a one minute break, General and Doctor.
[01:49:32.012 --> 01:49:34.934]  One minute break as we end the main radio show and then internet only.
[01:49:35.314 --> 01:49:42.699]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers will be able to see it and all the tens of thousands listening right now on the internet streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:42.779 --> 01:49:51.085]  But, when this video gets posted as an archive at PrisonPlanet.tv later in the day, not just a live stream, everybody get it out everywhere because
[01:49:52.463 --> 01:49:54.644]  It's worse than I even consciously know.
[01:49:54.704 --> 01:49:57.586]  As they mention other issues, I know it's all true.
[01:49:57.966 --> 01:49:59.387]  And just more pieces come in.
[01:50:00.207 --> 01:50:01.128]  This is eugenics.
[01:50:01.168 --> 01:50:05.090]  The White House chief admits it in his book, Ecoscience.
[01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:06.871]  They are killing us.
[01:50:06.951 --> 01:50:07.872]  This is real.
[01:50:08.192 --> 01:50:08.732]  Stay with us.
[01:50:08.772 --> 01:50:09.673]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:50:09.753 --> 01:50:10.773]  Infowars.com.
[01:50:14.035 --> 01:50:15.736]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:16.537 --> 01:50:18.838]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:21.601 --> 01:50:27.143]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:50:27.444 --> 01:50:28.604]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:50:28.744 --> 01:50:32.706]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:50:33.026 --> 01:50:34.567]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:50:34.887 --> 01:50:41.170]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:50:42.330 --> 01:50:44.871]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:50:45.191 --> 01:50:46.672]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:50:46.932 --> 01:50:49.713]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:50:49.933 --> 01:50:51.374]  And their formula really works.
[01:50:51.654 --> 01:50:54.195]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:50:54.475 --> 01:50:55.716]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:50:55.956 --> 01:51:00.358]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[01:51:00.718 --> 01:51:02.939]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:51:03.139 --> 01:51:05.420]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.361]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:51:07.701 --> 01:51:08.561]  Go to www.
[01:51:10.302 --> 01:51:15.343]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:51:44.672 --> 01:51:45.675]  Yeah.
[01:51:55.603 --> 01:52:02.649]  They want you dead, ladies and gentlemen, as the White Houses are over science states and wrote a textbook how to do it.
[01:52:02.949 --> 01:52:05.471]  You read that textbook, it's exactly what they're doing.
[01:52:06.192 --> 01:52:08.494]  We got Major General retired Stubblebine.
[01:52:08.934 --> 01:52:16.681]  We have his accomplished wife, Dr. Rima Labo, who's even treated heads of state, who openly talk about, yeah, it is the plan to kill everybody.
[01:52:17.515 --> 01:52:19.916]  This is serious business.
[01:52:20.396 --> 01:52:22.817]  It is serious business, and I want to make a point.
[01:52:23.237 --> 01:52:28.238]  There is an internet petition going around, which has all the right moves, so to speak.
[01:52:28.318 --> 01:52:29.639]  It says really good things.
[01:52:29.659 --> 01:52:31.339]  I agree with everything it says.
[01:52:31.419 --> 01:52:33.180]  It's completely useless.
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:46.624]  We have contacted the people who put it out, and we said, look, this has no political meaning, and right now the only solution that's going to keep us from these damn needles killing us, now or slowly,
[01:52:47.444 --> 01:52:48.665]  It's a political solution.
[01:52:49.065 --> 01:52:50.326]  We need a political solution.
[01:52:50.346 --> 01:52:55.449]  We need to make a state, too, and let people know they don't have to take these shots, but we just... Get to that in a few minutes.
[01:52:55.869 --> 01:53:15.521]  In the few minutes we have left here, though, and I want to give out the website and the letter and the phone numbers that you want people to call and specifics for what you want them to tell Congress when they call, but we just ended the last hour with General Stubblebine and yourself talking about how it is in the news, the CDC's calling and saying, have you had your shots when there's no law to take them?
[01:53:16.802 --> 01:53:25.189]  So they're using the pandemic fear over this one flu, and it says there, it's actually in the news, they're asking, has your daughter had her genital warts shot?
[01:53:25.989 --> 01:53:28.331]  Have you had your chicken pox shot?
[01:53:28.672 --> 01:53:31.314]  And then now they say they're going to go to your door.
[01:53:31.854 --> 01:53:35.177]  I mean, this is worse than the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[01:53:35.437 --> 01:53:36.959]  General Stolbein, your take on this?
[01:53:37.819 --> 01:53:40.682]  Well, they're very, very simple.
[01:53:42.021 --> 01:53:43.402]  Let me back off for one second.
[01:53:43.923 --> 01:53:51.050]  In every strategy, in every kind of military operation, you have a primary attack and you have secondary attacks.
[01:53:51.771 --> 01:53:54.995]  Right now, the primary attack looks to be like the vaccines.
[01:53:55.735 --> 01:54:01.141]  All of these other pieces are the secondary attacks or the preparations for the main attack.
[01:54:01.541 --> 01:54:02.763]  The main attack is coming.
[01:54:03.683 --> 01:54:05.044]  Let there be no doubt about it.
[01:54:05.544 --> 01:54:13.089]  And they have gone around and they have, literally from satellites, have taken pictures of your front door so they know where you are.
[01:54:13.429 --> 01:54:19.893]  They know your phone number, you know their name, and now they're asking the questions of, oh by the way, are you up to date on all your shots?
[01:54:20.413 --> 01:54:21.434]  Why would they do that?
[01:54:22.134 --> 01:54:26.258]  Unless they had somebody who was going to come to your door and give you a shot.
[01:54:26.378 --> 01:54:27.839]  No, they're saying it in the bill.
[01:54:28.099 --> 01:54:31.482]  And again, months ago we're saying, hey, they're getting GPS for shots.
[01:54:31.802 --> 01:54:33.884]  Now they're calling saying, we got your GPS.
[01:54:34.404 --> 01:54:36.326]  And they're saying, we're going to lock down cities.
[01:54:36.706 --> 01:54:41.470]  And it's going to be on your ID card, on your database, whether or not you've had the shots.
[01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:44.973]  I mean, this is, and they've got all these TV shows, General.
[01:54:45.874 --> 01:54:50.477]  With this preparatory phase of there's going to be a pandemic, do what the military says.
[01:54:50.838 --> 01:54:53.399]  I mean, they're really drilling the public consciousness.
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:59.083]  And you're saying, you're saying, looking at the pieces, General, you think they're getting ready to really red light things.
[01:54:59.424 --> 01:55:01.485]  And I mean, green light things.
[01:55:01.845 --> 01:55:03.266]  And that this is the real deal.
[01:55:03.787 --> 01:55:07.649]  We want to make it a red light.
[01:55:07.809 --> 01:55:09.711]  And that's what pushback does, Alex.
[01:55:10.316 --> 01:55:12.818]  And let me tell you what, let's go to principles of war.
[01:55:12.838 --> 01:55:19.204]  One of the principles of war, and one of the most important principles of war is called math.
[01:55:21.499 --> 01:55:28.445]  You need to put together the largest force that you can do that totally overwhelms the other side.
[01:55:29.046 --> 01:55:31.508]  Right now, they have got the mass.
[01:55:32.008 --> 01:55:35.551]  We have got the mass in people, but they have been silent.
[01:55:35.952 --> 01:55:39.975]  They have now got to get up on their high legs and make noise.
[01:55:40.676 --> 01:55:45.400]  All of them, all of the people in this nation have got to get their
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:56:08.105]  Take the action that Dr. Rima talked about before, www.healthfreedomusa.org, and go to the Action Now column on the right-hand side, and make sure that your voices, all of your voices, are heard in Congress, and in the state, and the federal level, and in all of the agencies.
[01:56:08.585 --> 01:56:09.965]  You want to do that.
[01:56:10.165 --> 01:56:15.246]  Not one person listening to your show, Alex, should be unaware of the fact that both state
[01:56:15.666 --> 01:56:27.710]  And federal statutes say that if you don't accept a mandatory vaccine in time of pandemic, you will be involuntarily quarantined and incarcerated.
[01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:32.251]  Yes, that's the official executive order and the statutes right now.
[01:56:32.571 --> 01:56:35.592]  They can drag you and your family away, put whatever they want in your body.
[01:56:35.932 --> 01:56:37.173]  Folks, this is tyranny.
[01:56:37.453 --> 01:56:38.793]  They've got a history of eugenics.
[01:56:39.033 --> 01:56:43.455]  The White House chief is a eugenicist calling for our sterilization and deaths.
[01:56:44.515 --> 01:56:45.776]  General Stubblevine, I'll say it.
[01:56:45.917 --> 01:56:52.462]  Do we not, as free sentient beings, have a right to self-defense against aggression?
[01:56:52.722 --> 01:56:55.465]  I don't care what bullcrap law they say they've got.
[01:57:02.944 --> 01:57:16.266]  He's standing on his hind legs yelling, and they need to go to the website, they need to take the action, and they need to make sure that all of their friends, and their friends, friends, friends, and their friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, do the same.
[01:57:16.766 --> 01:57:21.387]  Because the way we're going to beat this thing, Alex, is through mass.
[01:57:21.787 --> 01:57:28.308]  It is called action by every single American who does not want to die.
[01:57:28.328 --> 01:57:29.169]  Period.
[01:57:32.432 --> 01:57:32.652]  Yes.
[01:57:32.672 --> 01:57:32.752]  Yes.
[01:57:48.015 --> 01:57:53.978]  If it's, as people fight it, is to secure eventual peace and prosperity.
[01:57:54.018 --> 01:57:56.860]  Now for the generals and the globalists it's a whole different matter.
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.782]  But what people want is peace and prosperity.
[01:58:00.142 --> 01:58:04.484]  And if we accept these vaccines we will have neither peace nor prosperity.
[01:58:04.904 --> 01:58:08.626]  If we push back, yeah they'll be back again next time.
[01:58:10.688 --> 01:58:27.163]  I was about to say, look at 2002-2003, they tried to make their first responders take the inoculations as an act of supplication and submission, and their own enforcers who were going to supposedly be running the force injection drills on us, and they've had these drills publicly, they won't even take it.
[01:58:27.503 --> 01:58:32.270]  But let's not let them have this fake victory of scaring everybody with the flu.
[01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:33.932]  Then it kind of blows over.
[01:58:34.193 --> 01:58:36.897]  They give people a soft kill weapon, kills them a decade later.
[01:58:37.177 --> 01:58:40.462]  That's never psychologically attached to the event of the vaccine.
[01:58:40.802 --> 01:58:43.967]  And then next time they say take the shot, people are more compliant.
[01:58:44.227 --> 01:58:53.059]  We've got to build our mass, our force to say no to this, and they're using the psyop of this fear-mongering to try to set the precedent to do this.
[01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:58.246]  We have to grow our muscles and our mass and our force each time in this fight.
[01:58:58.286 --> 01:58:59.688]  Do you agree with that statement, General?
[01:58:59.708 --> 01:59:00.269]  Absolutely.
[01:59:01.567 --> 01:59:03.348]  Let's call it Freedom's Multiplier.
[01:59:03.388 --> 01:59:12.891]  If you sign this demand, and it's not a request Alex, it's a demand for the right to control what happens to your body and your children's body, and you don't get ten people or a hundred people to do the same, you
[01:59:30.638 --> 01:59:33.379]  You have failed in your duty as a free human being.
[01:59:33.779 --> 01:59:34.319]  Absolutely.
[01:59:34.339 --> 01:59:39.580]  And call into other talk shows and say, I want you to have General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo on.
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:41.641]  I want you to have other people on to talk about this.
[01:59:41.941 --> 01:59:43.861]  Get a huge buzz going as well.
[01:59:44.121 --> 01:59:45.762]  That's another area of the info war.
[01:59:46.042 --> 01:59:47.942]  These letters to the criminals is good as well.
[01:59:48.743 --> 01:59:54.324]  But this is part of the domestication, part of the process of training us to take their soft kill weapons.
[01:59:54.924 --> 01:59:59.286]  General Stubblevine, as this develops, let me have both of you back up in the near future as we go into the fall.
[01:59:59.887 --> 02:00:06.370]  You too, Dr. Labo, and Godspeed in the work you're doing on all these other fronts with the Codex Alimentarius.
[02:00:06.630 --> 02:00:09.572]  Let's not wait five or six months before we have you back on again.
[02:00:09.592 --> 02:00:10.212]  You got it!
[02:00:10.292 --> 02:00:14.535]  And let me close in one other Sun Tzu quote.
[02:00:14.895 --> 02:00:19.117]  There comes a time in every battle when both sides are defeated.
[02:00:19.517 --> 02:00:23.820]  The side that persists at that time is the winner.
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:32.608]  It's time for our voices to continue to make noise so that we are heard in mass.
[02:00:33.228 --> 02:00:33.669]  Thank you.
[02:00:34.489 --> 02:00:34.990]  Absolutely.
[02:00:35.651 --> 02:00:37.632]  Dr. Lamo, General Stubblevine, God bless you.
[02:00:37.652 --> 02:00:38.593]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:00:38.613 --> 02:00:39.334]  Keep up the good work.
[02:00:39.634 --> 02:00:40.195]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:00:41.355 --> 02:00:42.455]  You judge them by their fruits.
[02:00:42.515 --> 02:00:44.356]  I only see good fruits from these people.
[02:00:45.176 --> 02:00:47.697]  I've seen no evidence when people try to demonize them and attack them.
[02:00:47.717 --> 02:00:53.638]  But regardless, let's not get diverted by, is Alex Jones good or bad, or is General Stolbein good or bad, is Ron Paul good or bad.
[02:00:53.938 --> 02:00:58.679]  You know the New World Order has signed executive orders and are saying they're getting ready to forcibly inject you.
[02:00:58.899 --> 02:01:00.800]  I can show you a newscast of every newscast that we have.
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:01.960]  You've heard it, you've seen it.
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:03.420]  That's the issue.
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:04.701]  Face the issue at hand.
[02:01:05.001 --> 02:01:06.021]  Force inoculations.
[02:01:06.361 --> 02:01:09.602]  You want to call me an agent because I'm saying you shouldn't have to take force inoculations?
[02:01:09.942 --> 02:01:10.362]  Go ahead.
[02:01:10.422 --> 02:01:11.343]  That's go and tell pro.
[02:01:11.763 --> 02:01:12.663]  Be weak minded if you want.
[02:01:12.703 --> 02:01:20.745]  I got a few points I want to make in the next five minutes and then we are going to end this transmission for today.
[02:01:20.765 --> 02:01:22.606]  But first off, I want people to look at this again.
[02:01:23.106 --> 02:01:24.807]  Look at this article again and look at it carefully.
[02:01:25.887 --> 02:01:26.407]  This is key.
[02:01:28.648 --> 02:01:30.348]  I want everybody to go to InfoWars.com.
[02:01:32.009 --> 02:01:32.209]  I know
[02:01:34.065 --> 02:01:36.226]  I know that Kurt Nimmo and Paul Watson are doing stories on this.
[02:01:36.266 --> 02:01:40.687]  They need to tie it into the GPS and the people getting phone calls about inoculations and the rest of it.
[02:01:40.928 --> 02:01:46.710]  Healthcare bill will fund state vaccine teams to conduct interventions in private homes.
[02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:49.231]  CNS News, very credible.
[02:01:49.271 --> 02:01:51.872]  There is a knock at the front door, peeking through the window.
[02:01:51.912 --> 02:01:54.693]  A mother sees a man with a woman, both in uniform.
[02:01:55.053 --> 02:01:56.673]  Now, I was getting calls about this in the last month.
[02:01:56.713 --> 02:01:57.994]  This is now already happening.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:02.262]  They are agents of health care reform.
[02:02:02.322 --> 02:02:04.164]  Excuse me, ma'am, says the man.
[02:02:04.184 --> 02:02:05.685]  People have been describing this.
[02:02:06.406 --> 02:02:08.227]  They're even wearing, like, fake police uniforms.
[02:02:08.247 --> 02:02:10.669]  They're, like, blue that look like a police uniform.
[02:02:11.130 --> 02:02:11.710]  God help us.
[02:02:11.730 --> 02:02:13.111]  The eugenics teams are on the street.
[02:02:14.192 --> 02:02:15.333]  Excuse me, ma'am, says the man.
[02:02:15.714 --> 02:02:20.337]  Our records show you, our 11-year-old daughter, has not been immunized with Jindal Warts, which is the
[02:02:21.405 --> 02:02:22.767]  Soft kill, uh, Gardasil.
[02:02:23.608 --> 02:02:26.272]  And your four-year-old still needs a chickenpox vaccine, says the woman.
[02:02:26.893 --> 02:02:29.457]  He will not be able to start kindergarten unless he gets the shot.
[02:02:29.677 --> 02:02:31.540]  You know, says the man, smiling from ear to ear.
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:36.227]  And it just goes over, folks, this is now going on.
[02:02:38.513 --> 02:02:41.815]  My God, and they're talking about how it's a bill, and the bill's summary says they're going to do that.
[02:02:41.835 --> 02:02:44.676]  This is already being done with the CDC federally.
[02:02:45.036 --> 02:02:46.817]  I mean, this is total hell.
[02:02:47.118 --> 02:02:48.718]  Imagine if the Nazis would have come around.
[02:02:49.039 --> 02:02:49.839]  Oh, there's a flu scare.
[02:02:49.859 --> 02:02:50.920]  Everybody take your shot.
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.941]  Oh, people would have willingly done it.
[02:02:52.961 --> 02:02:54.742]  See, this is more sophisticated.
[02:02:54.762 --> 02:02:57.403]  The eugenicists got beaten back 60 years ago.
[02:02:57.483 --> 02:03:01.965]  Now they're here with a vengeance operating covertly.
[02:03:03.286 --> 02:03:06.268]  Okay, I want to go over these notes I've got here.
[02:03:07.438 --> 02:03:13.528]  But I also want to ask listeners to go to PrisonPlanet.com and get this article and get it out to everybody.
[02:03:14.770 --> 02:03:18.716]  This is of the greatest import that this be done.
[02:03:22.153 --> 02:03:27.075]  Obama's science advisor called for planetary regime enforces telemetry and population control measures.
[02:03:27.335 --> 02:03:28.735]  Folks, this has the documents, the book.
[02:03:28.755 --> 02:03:29.515]  You gotta read this.
[02:03:29.555 --> 02:03:31.476]  Now, these are some notes I wrote this morning.
[02:03:31.516 --> 02:03:33.136]  I promised I was going to cover these on air.
[02:03:33.436 --> 02:03:42.959]  I meant to spend hours elaborating on each, but I'm just going to go over this, these points I wrote slowly, so you know my philosophy and where I stand and where I hope people will stand with me on.
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:44.780]  We live
[02:03:46.604 --> 02:03:53.389]  A wonderful life on a wonderful planet full of wonders and full of just so many great things and so much goodness.
[02:03:53.509 --> 02:03:57.452]  And we've got to admit the evil in the world and fight the evil in the world to protect the good.
[02:03:57.973 --> 02:03:59.674]  And stop saying, hey man, just be positive.
[02:04:00.134 --> 02:04:00.915]  We are positive.
[02:04:00.935 --> 02:04:01.655]  That's why we're fighting.
[02:04:03.897 --> 02:04:06.079]  The only way to be in control is to kill.
[02:04:07.262 --> 02:04:09.883]  It is not easy to do good, it is easy to do evil.
[02:04:10.243 --> 02:04:14.084]  See, it's hard to control an outcome if you're trying to build and nurture and give people freedom.
[02:04:14.365 --> 02:04:19.426]  But it's easy if you're the dark new world order chiefs to engage in evil and extermination and control.
[02:04:19.446 --> 02:04:21.447]  Because they don't care who they hurt.
[02:04:22.387 --> 02:04:23.068]  Just remember that.
[02:04:24.608 --> 02:04:31.050]  They are the priests of power who love to press on the nerve of power, who love to grind humanity into submission, who love to engage in horrible tyrannies.
[02:04:31.311 --> 02:04:32.331]  We must resist them.
[02:04:33.908 --> 02:04:34.989]  So, step up to the plate.
[02:04:35.709 --> 02:04:38.971]  As I said in that rant in the first hour, which we're about to cut back to in a moment.
[02:04:42.213 --> 02:04:43.214]  Look what we've turned into.
[02:04:43.294 --> 02:04:43.694]  Torture.
[02:04:43.754 --> 02:04:45.655]  Tortures of people's children in front of their parents.
[02:04:45.715 --> 02:04:46.776]  Now admitted mainstream news.
[02:04:47.076 --> 02:04:48.917]  I told you seven years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[02:04:49.317 --> 02:04:49.997]  Hit teams.
[02:04:50.638 --> 02:04:52.279]  Banks robbing us and stealing.
[02:04:52.579 --> 02:04:55.721]  We're going into bondage to the elite, who think of us as total scum.
[02:04:59.892 --> 02:05:11.303]  To my attackers, many of which are not COINTELPRO and are not government, but pick up on COINTELPRO, who believe it's fashionable to attack me because I'm the most prominent voice in the fight against the globalists.
[02:05:11.343 --> 02:05:13.385]  My God, I can't believe I'm the most prominent.
[02:05:13.405 --> 02:05:18.950]  Anybody in the world, maybe Ron Paul or me, but I'm the more hardcore on some of the issues he won't get into.
[02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:22.633]  As he said to the camera as well, I haven't gotten to 9-11 because I'm too busy.
[02:05:23.754 --> 02:05:25.416]  We understand, but the issue is
[02:05:27.421 --> 02:05:30.204]  To those that attack me just because of jealousy or whatever.
[02:05:30.524 --> 02:05:31.084]  Jealous of what?
[02:05:31.124 --> 02:05:33.026]  That I was up here at one o'clock in the morning last night?
[02:05:33.527 --> 02:05:34.948]  Jealous because I'm fighting hard?
[02:05:35.068 --> 02:05:35.608]  Be leaders.
[02:05:36.269 --> 02:05:37.350]  Don't destroy yourselves.
[02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:41.194]  I want you to be right beside us and right in front of us and right behind us in this fight.
[02:05:41.254 --> 02:05:43.095]  And I know I'm good and I know I'm for real.
[02:05:43.496 --> 02:05:45.978]  And it's just sad to see you not being your own person.
[02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:48.640]  To see you obsessed with me.
[02:05:49.401 --> 02:05:53.325]  And in a way, it helps me become more famous and better known, but that's not what I want.
[02:05:54.025 --> 02:05:56.607]  I want us all to be leaders and to affect change.
[02:05:56.647 --> 02:06:02.531]  But in a negative, sick, worldly system, you're actually helping Alex Jones when you lie about me and attack me and spread my name.
[02:06:03.192 --> 02:06:07.255]  So in a way, I guess God just blesses us and people find out who I really am and find out the truth.
[02:06:07.315 --> 02:06:13.860]  So, it's just hurtful because I know I'm for real and I know 99% of what's said about me is a lie or a distortion.
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:21.145]  And a lot of you aren't government operatives, you just are very worldly and been twisted and I feel sorry for you.
[02:06:22.799 --> 02:06:25.602]  And I want you to be your own person and not be played.
[02:06:29.646 --> 02:06:30.687]  Be your own man and woman.
[02:06:31.408 --> 02:06:39.416]  A message to the Feds, the contractors, the ideologues, those of you that are on the wrong side of history against those of us that love liberty and freedom.
[02:06:41.578 --> 02:06:43.360]  This system hates you and abuses you.
[02:06:44.798 --> 02:06:46.339]  And is destroying your future as well.
[02:06:46.379 --> 02:06:49.341]  And I know they're hitting you with soft kill weapons and sterilization weapons.
[02:06:49.921 --> 02:06:50.802]  And it's just a fact.
[02:06:51.122 --> 02:06:57.826]  And you may like to feel like you're the winner and con yourself and decide to serve the system and laugh at us and decide you're in control.
[02:06:58.866 --> 02:07:00.727]  Bless your soul, you're not in control.
[02:07:00.747 --> 02:07:05.250]  The only way you're in control is of your own soul deciding to do right.
[02:07:05.530 --> 02:07:06.591]  You can make that decision.
[02:07:06.971 --> 02:07:08.352]  But the rest of it's in God's hands.
[02:07:09.642 --> 02:07:17.465]  And so I ask you to make that decision to do right, and to really, if you've got any soul left, any humanity left, to realize what you've been part of and stand up against the New World Order.
[02:07:19.666 --> 02:07:22.007]  So don't be part of the wrong side of history.
[02:07:26.909 --> 02:07:34.092]  You know, many of us are born into these different tribal groups and religious groups and are controlled, and we were sold out before we were even born.
[02:07:35.233 --> 02:07:37.314]  There's still time to turn back and wake up.
[02:07:38.698 --> 02:07:49.488]  And commit to standing up against tyranny and just getting out of your programming, realizing there's a bigger system around you that people are trying to manipulate you, that there are covert and overt agendas.
[02:07:50.689 --> 02:07:53.893]  I also just want to say I love life and creation and everything good and wholesome.
[02:07:55.014 --> 02:08:02.501]  I want to say that, and that I've been very appreciative and thankful for life, and that I know that good can win the day when it decides to stand up and take action.
[02:08:03.715 --> 02:08:11.002]  And I believe that that love of innocence and that love of creativity and that sense of wonderment is the keys to the universe and the soul and heart of God.
[02:08:13.784 --> 02:08:15.226]  Don't ever let them break your spirit!
[02:08:17.093 --> 02:08:20.776]  Doesn't matter how much I get attacked, how much I get lied about, how much people twist and distort.
[02:08:20.996 --> 02:08:21.776]  I know I'm real.
[02:08:22.036 --> 02:08:22.737]  I know I'm good.
[02:08:22.937 --> 02:08:23.998]  I know I'm telling the truth.
[02:08:24.478 --> 02:08:25.239]  And that's what matters.
[02:08:25.539 --> 02:08:28.261]  And you should have that same attitude and just move forward against the globalists.
[02:08:28.581 --> 02:08:29.822]  Warn the people you can.
[02:08:30.222 --> 02:08:31.543]  When you get laughed at, move on.
[02:08:31.583 --> 02:08:32.164]  It doesn't matter.
[02:08:32.584 --> 02:08:33.144]  It's sad.
[02:08:33.905 --> 02:08:35.386]  Stop caring what people think about you.
[02:08:40.385 --> 02:08:43.607]  Evil hides behind good, but the proof is always in the fruit.
[02:08:43.747 --> 02:08:44.807]  So, look at that.
[02:08:44.867 --> 02:08:46.768]  Realize how the enemy camouflages themselves.
[02:08:48.889 --> 02:08:54.212]  The elite are compartmentalized, specialized, and compartmentalized into different sectors of evil.
[02:08:54.512 --> 02:08:55.813]  Many of them don't see the big picture.
[02:08:56.073 --> 02:09:09.060]  So, as you show people the big picture and discuss the greater truths, you're going to unlock many of the evil people out there who've been caught up in this and not realize what they were part of, and many of them can come out of it.
[02:09:10.495 --> 02:09:17.886]  And many people will laugh at you up front, but as what you've warned them about comes true down the road, they will wake up.
[02:09:17.966 --> 02:09:19.268]  So it's a delayed event.
[02:09:19.328 --> 02:09:22.153]  Don't expect to see instant success when you're reaching out to people.
[02:09:22.193 --> 02:09:23.395]  Just like fighting the Federal Reserve.
[02:09:23.595 --> 02:09:24.657]  Look how far we've now come.
[02:09:27.428 --> 02:09:31.612]  We are in the midst of the greatest transformation in human history for good and bad.
[02:09:31.832 --> 02:09:39.020]  With the technological developments, the acceleration of knowledge, the acceleration of weapon systems, the decadence, the goodness, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:41.322]  Just realize you're part of an incredible time in history.
[02:09:41.643 --> 02:09:44.325]  Stop watching the sports, the sitcoms, the stuff that doesn't matter.
[02:09:44.626 --> 02:09:45.727]  Get tuned into reality.
[02:09:49.918 --> 02:09:50.859]  And leave your mark.
[02:09:50.999 --> 02:09:52.179]  Communicate with the future.
[02:09:52.259 --> 02:09:54.200]  Do things good for society and humanity.
[02:09:54.641 --> 02:09:55.541]  Find out the truth.
[02:09:56.762 --> 02:09:59.443]  And love humanity and realize you're part of something bigger.
[02:10:00.604 --> 02:10:04.646]  Realize that we are our ancestors and we are our future progeny.
[02:10:05.287 --> 02:10:06.627]  And that we're all one species.
[02:10:06.667 --> 02:10:09.729]  We're individuals, but we're also part of a greater tapestry.
[02:10:09.829 --> 02:10:16.393]  And in that, you certainly never die unless the species is irrevocably damaged by the criminal predators that are running the system.
[02:10:17.930 --> 02:10:23.535]  And again, leave the species better off than when you came to it.
[02:10:23.555 --> 02:10:25.497]  You know, that really is the whole sum of it.
[02:10:25.517 --> 02:10:26.938]  I want to say great job to the crew.
[02:10:26.958 --> 02:10:32.383]  We're going to go to retransmission now with a key rant I was doing in the first hour that I thought was very informative.
[02:10:32.623 --> 02:10:33.404]  A lot of key info.
[02:10:33.644 --> 02:10:34.285]  So that's coming up.
[02:10:34.325 --> 02:10:35.306]  Great job, crew!
[02:10:36.026 --> 02:10:37.588]  And as always, thank you for all your prayers.
[02:10:37.648 --> 02:10:42.792]  I'm praying for all you freedom lovers and people that love decency and creativity and honor and innocence.
[02:10:43.775 --> 02:10:44.656]  I'm here with you.
[02:10:44.676 --> 02:10:45.296]  You're with me.
[02:10:45.336 --> 02:10:48.197]  We're together in history together, in this moment, in forever.
[02:10:49.138 --> 02:10:51.639]  And I'll see you back live Monday.
[02:10:51.679 --> 02:10:52.800]  Burmese is sitting in tomorrow.
[02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:56.422]  And on Sunday, I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[02:10:56.582 --> 02:10:57.583]  God bless you all!
[02:11:14.082 --> 02:11:14.743]  Yeah!
