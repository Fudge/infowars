[00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:06.296]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:07.997]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:09.839]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.301]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:13.002]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:17.226]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:21.891]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.443]  Sam LaBaer is our guest for the next hour.
[00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:50.649]  He wrote a story for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that we'll go over coming up in the next segment.
[00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:55.974]  I'm also going to play a clip of him before one of the governments there in Canada.
[00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:15.160]  confronting the establishment, bringing up the fact that most terrorism is government-sponsored, and pointing out that a very suspicious company, in and around the 7-7 bombings in London, was there taking over some of the subway systems in Canada.
[00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:22.483]  So that's coming up, but the reason he's on today with us is a latest CONFAB, or meeting in Montreal,
[00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:25.170]  Adapting to a New World Order.
[00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.252]  Now that's the name of the conference.
[00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:30.054]  They have sub-conferences called Global Governance.
[00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:31.334]  Governance means government.
[00:01:33.496 --> 00:01:37.279]  They always play these child-like, semantic games with the public.
[00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.241]  They go, we don't want global government, we want global governance.
[00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:42.062]  Which means the exact same thing.
[00:01:42.883 --> 00:01:44.284]  The system of government is governance.
[00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.985]  It's a global system of government.
[00:01:50.512 --> 00:01:55.956]  They have these private meetings that nexus in with the governmental Security Prosperity Partnership meeting.
[00:01:56.376 --> 00:02:07.285]  When people last year tried to protest the North American Union meeting in secret, the police came out, dressed up like anarchists, attacked other police on camera, so the police could then attack peaceful demonstrators.
[00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:15.311]  But smart camera people followed the cops when they staged the arrest of them, posing as anarchists, and showed them taking the stuff off and
[00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:21.635]  The police had to admit later, the Royal Mounted Police, that they had staged attacks on their own officers as a pretext to attack their citizenry.
[00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:25.557]  That's because the Royal Mounted Police are now an alien group to Canada.
[00:02:25.837 --> 00:02:27.078]  They work for offshore banks.
[00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:29.660]  They're banning free speech in Canada, destroying liberty.
[00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:32.562]  They've arrested me when I go to Canada.
[00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:37.365]  Canada is an outrageous police state with a velvet glove on the steel fist.
[00:02:39.932 --> 00:02:44.773]  And so, we are joined by Sam LaBaer, and we appreciate you coming on, Sam.
[00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:49.754]  Tell us specifically where you hail from, Montreal 9-11 Truth, and break it down for folks.
[00:02:51.514 --> 00:02:53.134]  Well, thanks very much, Alex.
[00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:56.115]  Yeah, I'm from Montreal, Quebec.
[00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:59.575]  I'm a member of the Montreal 9-11 Truth group.
[00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:07.957]  And as you said, we saw that there was a conference being held here in Montreal that we called Moving Towards a New World Order.
[00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:16.736]  Which was quite an eye-opener when we saw that, so of course we had to cover it to find out as much as we could about it.
[00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:19.919]  And it turns out it's the top line of a Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.363]  Yeah, IMF, World Bank, you name it.
[00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:28.806]  And right now...
[00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:37.941]  I actually, I don't know what picture you have up on PrisonPlanTV, if it's the one that I sent you of me in front of the line of police?
[00:03:38.361 --> 00:03:39.642]  Yes, that's what I sent you yesterday.
[00:03:40.502 --> 00:03:50.387]  But actually, today it's really raining hard here in Montreal, and there is no one here, including the police, so I was actually able to walk right in.
[00:03:50.407 --> 00:03:55.170]  I'm actually inside the hotel, steps away from where the meeting has taken place.
[00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:58.438]  Amazing.
[00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:10.966]  We're going to break down what's happening at this meeting and how it affects Mexicans, Canadians, and people in the United States because this group is mentioned in the SPP documents that Judicial Watch and others sued and got two years ago.
[00:04:10.986 --> 00:04:12.827]  We have them on film in-game.
[00:04:13.527 --> 00:04:18.652]  And they're openly admitting it's the North American Union, that they're taking city, county, state rights away.
[00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:27.761]  So we're not just losing states' rights in Canada or the U.S., it's now being totally transferred outside the nation to these supranational boards.
[00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:32.085]  Just like our trade is ruled, not by our own governments, but by the World Trade Organization.
[00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:37.510]  Right, NAFTA, World Trade Organization, all kinds of extra-governmental agencies, yeah.
[00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:40.309]  Well, Sam LaBerge, stay there.
[00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:48.502]  We're going to come right back to you and break down the documents you've gotten from this conference, which is really just a public Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:04:48.823 --> 00:04:52.969]  It's not open to the public, but it's more open to the media, as they openly push world government.
[00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:54.549]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.293]  And I see so many comments online saying, they don't know what Bilderberg's talking about.
[00:04:58.313 --> 00:04:59.494]  They don't know they want world government.
[00:04:59.815 --> 00:05:00.255]  What do you mean?
[00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:00.996]  It's all admitted.
[00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:06.302]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:05:06.523 --> 00:05:10.287]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:10.767]  Number 2.
[00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:16.154]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:16.454 --> 00:05:16.895]  It's true.
[00:05:17.095 --> 00:05:21.300]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.021]  Number 3.
[00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:27.888]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:28.289]  Number 4.
[00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:31.373]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:05:31.613 --> 00:05:34.998]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:39.023]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.
[00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.471]  A long time sponsor of ours.

[00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:54.514]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:02.892]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:07.596]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:06:07.737 --> 00:06:10.499]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.562]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:18.466]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:06:18.686 --> 00:06:19.647]  If you simply prepare.
[00:06:19.807 --> 00:06:22.770]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:29.978]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:33.181]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:33.582]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:34.883]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:44.552]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:06:44.732 --> 00:06:48.475]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:48.495 --> 00:06:50.217]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:06:50.237 --> 00:06:50.737]  Take action today.
[00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:52.258]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:05.340]  I named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.982]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:17.568]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.694]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:07:23.995 --> 00:07:26.496]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:36.444]  So, MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:47.212]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:51.314]  Visit www.chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:54.216]  That's www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[00:07:54.396 --> 00:07:55.456]  It takes very little money.
[00:07:55.577 --> 00:07:57.998]  And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:00.639]  Remember www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:25.129]  I'm here tonight to address Monsieur Dauphine's involvement in the signing of the contract in 2004 with Varent, who is providing the security cameras and the installation in our metro.
[00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:32.191]  A few months ago, there was a group of my colleagues who came to this chamber to ask Monsieur Dauphine about this subject.
[00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:48.689]  Which he feigned ignorance about, saying he had no idea what we were talking about, what contract we were talking about, what company we were talking about, even though we have him in press releases describing the wonders that various security systems will bring to Montreal.
[00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.612]  So I'm not here tonight to ask Mr. Dauphine
[00:08:53.574 --> 00:09:04.778]  Why he has given this company, which has extensive ties to CIA, Mossad, and MI6, this contract to our city, because it is quite apparent he does not want to answer that question.
[00:09:04.838 --> 00:09:20.523]  I'm only here tonight to express my concern as a citizen and as someone who takes the metro every day, to inform all of you that there are many of us in this city who know the truth about what happened on September 11th, what happened in London on 7-7,
[00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:36.013]  And that you had better make sure that nothing happens to our city, because if an attack happens in the metro, and you try and blame it on Al-Qaeda or Iran or whatever they're going to try and blame it on, we will not believe you.
[00:09:37.412 --> 00:09:40.433]  And that is the only reason I came here tonight.
[00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:42.954]  Thank you very much for your time.
[00:09:43.294 --> 00:09:54.638]  We had the occasion, I think it was last year or two years ago, to answer some questions, like the one we're having tonight.
[00:09:56.438 --> 00:10:03.443]  My colleague, Joe Toudet, the president of the MTC, Montreal Transit Corporation, had the opportunity to answer these questions.
[00:10:03.523 --> 00:10:11.309]  What I remember about this question is that we had been in public tender in 2004, and it's a company that won the public tender.
[00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:16.833]  So I'm not aware, personally, Mr. Speaker, exactly which company got it, which other company didn't get it.
[00:10:23.137 --> 00:10:36.556]  But I know that all the rules were not followed, and we had been in public tenders, and there was a selection committee with a jury, and it's the best company in my knowledge that got the contract.
[00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.778]  But otherwise, I have no...
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:49.787]  No, I would just like to clarify that I am not accusing anyone here of complicity in any sort of conspiracy or what have you.
[00:10:49.847 --> 00:10:57.493]  I simply want to make known that there are thousands of citizens in Montreal, that if there is an attack, that we will not believe the stories that you give us.
[00:10:57.593 --> 00:10:59.755]  That's all I wanted to say.
[00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:01.016]  Thank you very much.
[00:11:11.808 --> 00:11:25.897]  Alright, that's Sam Labreer, joining us from 9-11, Montreal Truth, and they've confronted members of the Parliament, they've confronted the former Prime Ministers, they've confronted the City Councils, bringing this up.
[00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:35.143]  And you have to understand, with 7-7, we know the government carried out the attacks, and I've made the film Terror Storm detailing that.
[00:11:35.603 --> 00:11:39.205]  That's even more clear-cut than 9-11.
[00:11:40.714 --> 00:11:42.175]  Which is also very easily proven.
[00:11:42.675 --> 00:11:44.616]  But with 7-7, we have a lot of specifics.
[00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:50.159]  That's why they quietly had to turn loose all the people they claim were involved in supporting the plot.
[00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:57.083]  They were really just government agents, people that were being recruited into intelligence, asked to take part in the drill, and then they blew them up.
[00:11:58.103 --> 00:11:59.264]  On board the trains and buses.
[00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.986]  That's why visor consultancy for the government in the metro,
[00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:12.017]  Was running a drill of the exact same bus and exact same train, subways, being bombed at the exact same time and date in London.
[00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:13.138]  Impossible.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:21.125]  Same thing on 9-11, they had the exact same drills, exact same time, USA Today, Associated Press, same buildings being attacked.
[00:12:22.806 --> 00:12:32.874]  That way if good people in government that are compartmentalized and aren't part of the small group carrying out the attack, that way if the bad guys get caught by the good guys, they can say, oh, it was just part of a drill.
[00:12:35.725 --> 00:12:38.206]  And they'll even come out and admit they were doing these drills.
[00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:42.567]  A lot of times, just to throw it in everybody's face and say, well, we admit we were doing the drill.
[00:12:42.888 --> 00:12:43.668]  How unusual!
[00:12:44.248 --> 00:12:58.213]  But the fact that the gentleman we have on the line with us went down there and confronted them, Sam LeBear, the fact that he did that
[00:12:59.827 --> 00:13:06.914]  Pre-empts what they're doing, because I remember at the time, being on air, they were already saying in Montreal News, we think Al-Qaeda is going to hit the subway.
[00:13:08.435 --> 00:13:10.077]  We're pretty sure we're going to have a 7-7 here.
[00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:21.952]  And then they had that stage capture of people that were planning it and all the rest of it, and it turned out that was fake, just like the thing two weeks ago with the black guys in New York and New Jersey who had no intention of bombing anything.
[00:13:22.192 --> 00:13:25.394]  The FBI created the group, tried to get them to carry out terror.
[00:13:25.414 --> 00:13:27.836]  They weren't even Muslims, just like Miami in 96.
[00:13:27.876 --> 00:13:28.116]  Same story.
[00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:38.101]  Sam, we can ask him now, saw this threat, went down and preemptively said, don't try that here.
[00:13:38.862 --> 00:13:39.842]  I mean, is that what you did?
[00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:42.204]  Is that why you went ahead and went down and talked to him, sir?
[00:13:43.185 --> 00:13:51.451]  Well, before we get into that, didn't I see a few days ago on your website that there was an explosion in North Carolina that they blamed on a drill?
[00:13:52.512 --> 00:13:54.754]  But, you know, it could be the same thing, right?
[00:13:56.221 --> 00:13:56.802]  Absolutely!
[00:13:57.482 --> 00:13:59.565]  In fact, that's up on Infowars.com today.
[00:13:59.585 --> 00:14:05.311]  I haven't even covered that, where they staged a terror attack and then just said it was a drill.
[00:14:05.751 --> 00:14:12.558]  Was that an operation where the police got caught and then a huge explosion, areas destroyed, is just turned into no big deal.
[00:14:12.598 --> 00:14:13.899]  In fact, I'm going to print that right now.
[00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:15.061]  Go ahead, tell folks about that.
[00:14:16.547 --> 00:14:20.694]  Well, all I know is, um, what I saw on your website, but I mean, it was extremely suspicious.
[00:14:20.714 --> 00:14:30.349]  It reminded me, of course, of, uh, my husband, of 7-7, of the fact that he'd run these drills as cover, and in case something goes wrong, they can say, oh, it was a drill, never mind, don't worry about it.
[00:14:33.109 --> 00:14:33.790]  It's amazing.
[00:14:35.231 --> 00:14:50.488]  Let's speak about government-sponsored terrorism first and Montreal 9-11 Truth and more of how you guys are going out and bringing up these key issues and how preemptively talking about how they may be planning to stage terror can preempt their activities in a devastating fashion.
[00:14:50.528 --> 00:14:53.812]  You also see how serious the government was taking what you were
[00:14:54.753 --> 00:14:55.974]  What you were just now saying.
[00:14:57.154 --> 00:15:06.438]  Let's go ahead and go through that and then into the public Bilderberg Group event happening as they take over your government, openly announcing world government in Canada.
[00:15:07.098 --> 00:15:24.365]  Yeah, well, I have to say that actually I wouldn't have even have been aware of the company being given the contract for the security cameras in our subway if it weren't for the work of other members of Montreal 9-11 Truth who came along first and did the research
[00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:25.967]  And found out about it.
[00:15:26.687 --> 00:15:30.949]  And when I found out, I mean, it didn't pass the stink test.
[00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:44.637]  This company had been given the right to the security cameras in the London Underground right before 7-7, which, I mean, we all remember, of course, were the same cameras that, you know, didn't work that day on 7-7.
[00:15:44.657 --> 00:15:52.121]  It's a company that's owned by a former Mossad official.
[00:15:53.908 --> 00:16:05.754]  He's now fighting extradition from, I think it's, like, Liberia or some African country that doesn't have extradition treaties because he's being brought up on fraud charges.
[00:16:05.774 --> 00:16:07.495]  I mean, this guy is a piece of work.
[00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:19.321]  And he gave his company the contract for our subway system here in Montreal after it didn't function in the London bombings on 7-7.
[00:16:19.381 --> 00:16:20.382]  I mean, come on.
[00:16:20.962 --> 00:16:22.283]  So when I heard that,
[00:16:23.247 --> 00:16:40.255]  I had to go down and videotape my confrontation with the City Hall and put it up on YouTube so that if there was ever something that would happen in Montreal, we could at least point to that in the past and say, look, you know, some people were warning about this before it happened.
[00:16:42.897 --> 00:16:51.361]  Well, absolutely, and it's important to add here that it came out in the news on the day of 7-7
[00:16:53.018 --> 00:17:07.667]  that Benjamin Netanyahu was warned by the head of the Mossad and because he gave a press conference and he was in 7-7 that day just a few hundred yards away from the first train bombing to quote not take the subway
[00:17:08.752 --> 00:17:26.148]  uh... because of dangers in the subway that day and then even though that was in her rich in jerusalem post and a p n uh... was all over the news and they came out the news and denied it and said it was all a conspiracy theory and then a week later they had a massage came out again and said no we did warn him we knew this was going to happen
[00:17:26.798 --> 00:17:29.520]  Oh yeah, I mean it's like, uh, what's his name, Peter Power?
[00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:31.562]  Yes, advisor-consultant.
[00:17:32.023 --> 00:17:38.428]  Just happened to be running drills at the same locations at the same time on the same day, and I mean, well that's just computer security, right?
[00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:44.534]  I mean, anybody who's got a little common sense knows that the computer security is just trying to disperse information.
[00:17:45.855 --> 00:17:48.097]  But anybody with a modicum of common sense
[00:17:48.618 --> 00:17:49.498]  Well it certainly is.
[00:17:49.518 --> 00:17:51.679]  You've been out on the ground the last few days.
[00:17:51.699 --> 00:17:53.719]  This thing is going through the 8th to the 11th.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.820]  Let's now get into the main story today, the main event as they say.
[00:18:13.015 --> 00:18:22.359]  For those who just tuned in, describe what's happening in Montreal, who's meeting, the name of the conference, the sub-conferences within it, calling openly for world government.
[00:18:22.819 --> 00:18:28.182]  Yes, so it's the International Economic Forum of the Americas, which takes place every year.
[00:18:28.342 --> 00:18:30.443]  It's a conference of Montreal, takes place every year.
[00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:31.983]  This is the 15th anniversary.
[00:18:32.544 --> 00:18:36.705]  And this year's conference is entitled, Adapting to a New World Order.
[00:18:37.306 --> 00:18:42.228]  Like you said, it's taking place Monday to Thursday, the 8th to the 11th.
[00:18:43.484 --> 00:18:53.670]  Yesterday had an opening plenary session at 8.30 in the morning with the head of the IMF and that one was titled Towards a New Global Economic Order.
[00:18:54.430 --> 00:19:05.476]  There's also other forums and luncheons yesterday with the titles A New World Governance and Thriving in a New Financial Order.
[00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:10.379]  Today the topic is Energy Health.
[00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:18.464]  And there's a lot of focus on genomics, with genetic research today.
[00:19:18.864 --> 00:19:26.931]  There's even a plenary session given by the UN, UNESCO, which is part of the UN, entitled Genomics Towards a Revolution.
[00:19:27.852 --> 00:19:30.654]  And then tomorrow, there's a big thing to be watching out for.
[00:19:30.734 --> 00:19:37.960]  There's a luncheon at noon tomorrow entitled The Americas and the New World Order, and that's being chaired by Madeleine Albright.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:47.246]  Stay there, I want to hear the answer to this when we get back with our guest covering what's happening up there in Montreal right now, Sam LaBriere.
[00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:49.327]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[00:20:01.465 --> 00:20:11.556]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:20:12.037 --> 00:20:13.078]  Garden in a can!
[00:20:13.458 --> 00:20:17.042]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[00:20:17.603 --> 00:20:19.365]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:21.908]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.

[00:20:32.058 --> 00:20:33.059]  Garden in a can.
[00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:34.320]  It's that simple.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:34.981]  Fresh.
[00:20:35.381 --> 00:20:35.761]  Healthy.

[00:20:54.177 --> 00:21:06.384]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:12.428]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:19.164]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:19.484 --> 00:21:21.285]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:21.445 --> 00:21:23.826]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:23.906 --> 00:21:34.851]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:37.092 --> 00:21:38.372]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.772 --> 00:21:40.113]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.623 --> 00:21:46.949]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:21:55.797 --> 00:21:56.938]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:58.620]  The people strike back.
[00:22:00.201 --> 00:22:06.387]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.846 --> 00:22:14.614]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.974 --> 00:22:22.842]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.142 --> 00:22:27.887]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.208 --> 00:22:32.930]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:37.293]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:37.793 --> 00:22:38.793]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:38.873 --> 00:22:42.955]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:22:48.278 --> 00:22:50.839]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:59.431 --> 00:23:04.915]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[00:23:05.395 --> 00:23:06.115]  Think about that.
[00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:08.817]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:23:09.298 --> 00:23:12.219]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:22.286]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.

[00:23:28.569 --> 00:23:29.610]  The choice is yours.
[00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:35.012]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.

[00:24:17.466 --> 00:24:18.607]  Sam LeBlair is our guest.
[00:24:19.447 --> 00:24:22.269]  The article is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.232]  This morning I was reading email and I was sent an email.
[00:24:27.252 --> 00:24:28.673]  It's here in my stack.
[00:24:28.693 --> 00:24:33.576]  I forgot to dig it out during the break because I was doing a quick four-minute interview on 93.7 here in town with Charlie Hodge.
[00:24:35.097 --> 00:24:35.638]  Great guy.
[00:24:37.399 --> 00:24:38.840]  And I printed off the
[00:24:41.052 --> 00:24:45.094]  Here it is, the Obama deception movie, Moon Battery at its finest.
[00:24:45.954 --> 00:25:01.400]  And I was reading the guy's article attacking the Obama deception, and then I was reading his comments under, when people were countering him, going, because in his article he says there's no global government, there's no such thing as a new world order, none of this exists, and then people are commenting going, no, there is a Bilderberg group.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:10.343]  There is a New World Order, and he says, yeah, there's a Bilderberg Group, but Alex Jones is just reaching and connecting dots that aren't there and saying they want world government.
[00:25:10.723 --> 00:25:19.806]  He doesn't know what they're saying in secret, and he goes, yeah, it might look suspicious to, you know, a moon bat that world elites are meeting secretly, but he doesn't know what they're saying.
[00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:23.449]  No, and if you did a review of the Obama Deception, you knew that.
[00:25:23.849 --> 00:25:25.190]  We show mainstream articles.
[00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.173]  Bilderberg Group has now gone public, saying we're setting up a quote, new world order.
[00:25:29.454 --> 00:25:46.387]  They give interviews to Time Magazine, Newsweek, Financial Times of London, and they say, we're going to have a tyrannical, authoritarian, they use the term authoritarian, world government, and we built it in secret, because you wouldn't want it, we know what's best for you.
[00:25:47.248 --> 00:25:54.493]  And it's going to save you from the economic collapse, which they engineered, doesn't mention that, and a new carbon tax to regulate and control every facet of your life.
[00:25:55.554 --> 00:26:11.025]  So it doesn't matter when they're in hundreds of mainstream news articles, I've seen, we probably put 15, Time Magazine, Newsweek, Financial Times of London, articles with them saying it, blowing up the text, with Etienne d'Avignon, the head of the Bilderberg Group, saying it.
[00:26:13.445 --> 00:26:14.686]  And what do I get?
[00:26:14.766 --> 00:26:18.149]  I get to be called a kook because I know they're taking over our society.
[00:26:20.611 --> 00:26:24.134]  Now, is this guy an operative or is he just a wannabe?
[00:26:24.574 --> 00:26:25.355]  Probably a wannabe.
[00:26:25.455 --> 00:26:32.861]  Thinks he's part of the system, thinks he has personal power, thinks by accepting the power elite and making excuses that he's part of it.
[00:26:33.742 --> 00:26:36.824]  You know, conscious, unconsciously climbing the ladder.
[00:26:36.844 --> 00:26:38.305]  A lot of people are like that.
[00:26:38.325 --> 00:26:39.766]  They'll do anything to climb the ladder.
[00:26:40.107 --> 00:26:42.709]  Even the ladder leads them downward into hell.
[00:26:46.957 --> 00:26:51.601]  Like this guy says, it seems like some of you posting have no idea about Alex Jones and what he said, predicted.
[00:26:51.842 --> 00:26:57.807]  Some of you are awake, but the guy with the picture of him, that's the writer, is some douchebag, corporate uniform.
[00:26:58.087 --> 00:27:04.313]  You need to wake up and realize that that material stuff you love means nothing to bettering you as a person.
[00:27:04.333 --> 00:27:05.434]  And it goes on.
[00:27:06.335 --> 00:27:10.219]  And then the writer goes on, I'm trying to find, I should have highlighted it, I just printed it.
[00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:12.240]  He goes on to say,
[00:27:16.089 --> 00:27:20.632]  He goes on to say that, uh... Oh, well I know it looks suspicious.
[00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:21.573]  I'll find it during the break.
[00:27:21.593 --> 00:27:25.055]  I don't want to make our guests sit there on hold while I'm babbling going over this.
[00:27:25.095 --> 00:27:26.576]  He goes on to show the double thing.
[00:27:27.196 --> 00:27:28.157]  That we're making up.
[00:27:28.177 --> 00:27:32.900]  You know, they're having this Bilderberg Group sub-conference, steering group meeting in Canada.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:39.504]  They said they're setting up a North American Union and a global governance publicly with their own press releases.
[00:27:39.784 --> 00:27:41.345]  And this guy says, nope, doesn't exist.
[00:27:44.167 --> 00:27:44.867]  Sir, continue.
[00:27:44.927 --> 00:27:45.548]  Sam, continue.
[00:27:46.906 --> 00:27:51.909]  Alex, don't get discouraged by the naysayers and the people who call you names.
[00:27:51.949 --> 00:27:55.992]  They're only doing that because you're actually having an effect and they're actually scared of you.
[00:27:56.696 --> 00:27:57.537]  So don't ever forget that.
[00:27:57.557 --> 00:27:59.858]  Wow, so I'll always be nitwit like that with you, right?
[00:28:23.942 --> 00:28:26.104]  Yeah, but they run things.
[00:28:26.144 --> 00:28:29.927]  They're the minions that the establishment uses to keep this fraud going.
[00:28:29.947 --> 00:28:30.387]  But go ahead.
[00:28:31.728 --> 00:28:34.611]  Well, that's why they're so afraid of the internet media now, right?
[00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:38.494]  Because we're taking over from them quite a bit.
[00:28:38.714 --> 00:28:40.795]  Their credibility is severely damaged.
[00:28:42.397 --> 00:28:52.365]  Anyway, before the break, tomorrow there's a big luncheon headed by Madeleine Albright which is entitled, The Americas and the New World Order.
[00:28:52.958 --> 00:29:01.214]  Which could very well be the discussion of the North American Union that the reporter was telling us about yesterday was happening on Wednesday.
[00:29:02.102 --> 00:29:13.209]  And then on Thursday, the closing lunch and the final event of the whole thing, it's titled The Economic Crisis and the Role of Central Banks and How Far Can They Go?
[00:29:13.529 --> 00:29:23.435]  Which sounds pretty boring at first, but if you look at the subtitle, it's called NASA and the Economic Recovery, the Required Joint Action between North America and Central Banks.
[00:29:23.914 --> 00:29:25.475]  Stay there, let's break it down when we get back.
[00:29:25.515 --> 00:29:26.515]  Long segment coming up.
[00:29:26.755 --> 00:29:27.656]  That was a short segment.
[00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:28.976]  Absolutely.
[00:29:29.236 --> 00:29:42.582]  When you read the SPP documents from 2006, declassified in 2007, in Endgame, we have a bibliography, whatistheendgame.com, has all those documents linked, time-coded for the film.
[00:29:44.003 --> 00:29:48.365]  When you link through to all of that, it's just incredible.
[00:29:49.065 --> 00:29:50.106]  And I'll explain this when we get back.
[00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:54.418]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.339 --> 00:29:58.143]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.098 --> 00:31:09.768]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:31:10.208 --> 00:31:14.913]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:31:15.374 --> 00:31:17.937]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[00:31:18.137 --> 00:31:18.757]  We're good to go!
[00:31:37.628 --> 00:31:38.609]  We're good to go.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.845]  Catastrophe is defined as a sudden and widespread disaster.
[00:32:06.125 --> 00:32:08.768]  The only way to be truly ready is to prepare yourself
[00:32:14.835 --> 00:32:15.195]  I think so.
[00:32:40.578 --> 00:32:40.998]  We're good.
[00:33:04.329 --> 00:33:06.832]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:10.115]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.135 --> 00:33:22.728]  Samuel Greer is our guest, joining us from Montreal, Canada, up there at a establishment, global government meeting, kind of a Bilderberg Group steering meeting, is what these really are.
[00:33:23.369 --> 00:33:27.072]  When you read the SPP documents, hundreds and hundreds of pages, I've read them all.
[00:33:27.912 --> 00:33:34.355]  And then we got screenshots of the key parts and put it in Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, now released almost two years ago.
[00:33:36.135 --> 00:33:40.157]  That film's more important now than then, because so much of what we talked about has now happened.
[00:33:40.677 --> 00:33:55.103]  I talk about how the banks are going to implode things by design and a lot more, because I'm reading their documents and they say in there, we're going to use economic crises, biological crises, biological attack crises, environmental crises, global warming, and climate change,
[00:33:56.303 --> 00:33:57.664]  And we're going to use the threat of terror.
[00:33:58.365 --> 00:34:02.348]  Through these crises, we will have our new world order emerge.
[00:34:02.848 --> 00:34:03.709]  And they also talk about...
[00:34:04.761 --> 00:34:08.864]  We can't let the public know that we're setting this up.
[00:34:08.884 --> 00:34:09.985]  This has got to be secret.
[00:34:10.385 --> 00:34:11.306]  Secrecy is key.
[00:34:11.326 --> 00:34:12.526]  That's in the first pages.
[00:34:13.087 --> 00:34:14.208]  It's unbelievable.
[00:34:14.248 --> 00:34:17.029]  You can read them at judicialwatch.org.
[00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.492]  We've got the documents saved at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:34:20.932 --> 00:34:22.733]  Or as I say, whatistheendgame.com.
[00:34:23.114 --> 00:34:25.435]  So important people get that DVD.
[00:34:26.716 --> 00:34:28.037]  And, uh, get it out to everybody.
[00:34:28.057 --> 00:34:29.637]  I mean, that is the most important film I've made.
[00:34:29.657 --> 00:34:34.500]  The Obama deception is the most viral, the one spreading the fastest for people that don't know what's going on.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:44.945]  This shows how the left and right's controlled, how it's a controlled paradigm, how the offshore banks operate, how we never go past our own governments to see the outside criminal alien force that's doing this.
[00:34:44.965 --> 00:34:47.866]  You know, alien to our system, our Constitution, our Bill of Rights.
[00:34:50.751 --> 00:34:54.976]  That's good, but then the second film you give somebody is in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:34:54.997 --> 00:34:59.582]  You say, now you want to understand what they... Now you understand who the globalists are from their own admissions.
[00:35:00.183 --> 00:35:03.588]  Now, understand what their total goals are and how they operate.
[00:35:04.785 --> 00:35:06.106]  Going back to Sam LaBriere.
[00:35:06.586 --> 00:35:08.468]  Sam, continue.
[00:35:08.508 --> 00:35:11.209]  You were going over the conference and what they're talking about.
[00:35:11.229 --> 00:35:13.871]  The role of central banks, how far can they go?
[00:35:14.472 --> 00:35:15.112]  And how far?
[00:35:15.152 --> 00:35:16.733]  They've hijacked our governments completely.
[00:35:16.953 --> 00:35:21.696]  They're sucking the entire GDP in seven months out of Canada and out of Europe and out of the U.S.
[00:35:21.716 --> 00:35:23.518]  They're all on the same line, same people running it.
[00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:34.045]  Zolick, the head of the World Bank, big neocons, openly announcing that they may have to have martial law, there's going to be rioting, that they're taking over, that the banks will need total power over everything.
[00:35:34.385 --> 00:35:37.607]  This is world government by a private financial elite.
[00:35:37.647 --> 00:35:38.287]  It's very simple.
[00:35:38.588 --> 00:35:43.911]  Corporations so big, they have hostile corporate takeovers of nation states.
[00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:51.676]  And then, they levy taxes through that government, conduiting it to themselves, and they use government regulators to shut down their competition.
[00:35:52.057 --> 00:35:53.858]  Continue with this key meeting titled
[00:35:54.998 --> 00:36:07.085]  Well, I was just saying that the last luncheon is going to be on Thursday at noon.
[00:36:07.445 --> 00:36:11.407]  It's entitled, The Economic Crisis and the Role of Central Banks, How Far Can They Go?
[00:36:11.847 --> 00:36:19.931]  But then the subtitle says, NASA and the Economic Recovery, the Required Joint Action Between North American Central Banks.
[00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:39.353]  And you have the Governor of the Central Bank of Mexico and the Central Bank of Canada speaking, Alain de Marais, who is the father of our former Prime Minister, Jean Chrétien, and the wife of Paul or André de Marais, I can't remember which one, but one of the sons of the big Gilbert family here in Montreal.
[00:36:39.693 --> 00:36:44.175]  And so, I mean, the title required joint action between North America and the Central Bank.
[00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:48.457]  In other words, North America and the Central Bank are going to have to start working together much, much more
[00:36:48.962 --> 00:36:52.364]  Closely, almost, as you say, united.
[00:36:52.384 --> 00:36:59.408]  So, I mean, this could be the first step towards a united North American Union at the Central Bank.
[00:37:01.709 --> 00:37:02.270]  Continue.
[00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:16.458]  Yeah, and tomorrow, like I said, the speech by Madeleine Albright to the Americas and the New World Order is definitely one we should try and get extra, or try and find out what's discussed,
[00:37:17.825 --> 00:37:21.487]  I think it's most definitely talking about the FTP and the North American Union.
[00:37:22.708 --> 00:37:40.938]  Today, in the media, a lot of the big soundbites I've been hearing from Dominic Strauss-Kahn, who's the head of the IMF, his big soundbite from yesterday saying that there doesn't exist anything in the world except
[00:37:42.114 --> 00:37:42.295]  Oh, okay.
[00:37:50.063 --> 00:37:54.045]  In other words, what he's saying is we need a global system of financial regulation.
[00:37:54.085 --> 00:37:55.866]  That's the only thing that makes sense.
[00:37:55.886 --> 00:37:56.327]  That's right.
[00:37:56.367 --> 00:37:59.548]  You can't have the nations running themselves.
[00:37:59.969 --> 00:38:01.369]  International bodies have to do it.
[00:38:01.409 --> 00:38:02.450]  That's already happening.
[00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.931]  This is just the coming out of it.
[00:38:04.971 --> 00:38:08.433]  And oh, there's a financial crisis we engineered on paper.
[00:38:08.493 --> 00:38:10.595]  They admitted they did, but that's never discussed.
[00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:13.096]  We're now going to take full control over your life.
[00:38:13.696 --> 00:38:14.457]  Here's that article.
[00:38:15.681 --> 00:38:18.204]  Here, the Obama deception movie, Moon Battery at its finest.
[00:38:18.724 --> 00:38:20.266]  And here's the author's comments.
[00:38:20.886 --> 00:38:22.168]  He goes by R. Caddy.
[00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:31.797]  You don't believe a handful of politically connected wealthy individuals meeting together a few times a year to discover world domination, do you, to discuss it?
[00:38:33.319 --> 00:38:34.200]  Oh, right, you do.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.683]  So he's saying to a guy he's arguing with in the comments that we're like crazy.
[00:38:38.204 --> 00:38:38.844]  Then it goes on.
[00:38:39.758 --> 00:38:40.398]  Well, they do!
[00:38:40.958 --> 00:38:42.099]  They're called the Bilderberg Group.
[00:38:42.139 --> 00:38:42.539]  Look it up.
[00:38:43.019 --> 00:38:46.460]  They had a meeting in my hometown here in Ottawa, Canada, a while back.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.501]  It was reported on the local news, CTV, I think.
[00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:55.302]  I doubt you'll find any coverage of the meeting in American media, but you can probably find it on YouTube.
[00:38:55.342 --> 00:38:58.883]  The most notable attendees were David Rockefeller, Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands.
[00:38:59.344 --> 00:39:00.644]  I wonder what they're talking about.
[00:39:01.886 --> 00:39:02.506]  And he goes on.
[00:39:03.147 --> 00:39:06.830]  No one is denying their existence, and it may look strange, shady, weird, whatever.
[00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:12.014]  But not knowing what they are talking about does not give us any right to insert our own projections.
[00:39:12.534 --> 00:39:22.001]  The problem with conspiracy theorists is that not knowing drives them to their own conclusions based on whether ideas, notions they have brewing in their heads.
[00:39:22.581 --> 00:39:25.744]  It is a dangerous and twisted approach to life problems.
[00:39:26.963 --> 00:39:35.115]  Now, you just read from their own press releases what they are, behind closed doors, discussing.
[00:39:35.155 --> 00:39:37.038]  But their own press release, global government.
[00:39:38.357 --> 00:39:40.298]  Central banks taking over and running things.
[00:39:40.999 --> 00:39:43.140]  Nation states not being able to say no.
[00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:45.181]  Calling it global government.
[00:39:45.241 --> 00:39:46.262]  Calling it New World Order.
[00:39:46.302 --> 00:39:48.323]  And we go, they're announcing New World Order.
[00:39:48.383 --> 00:39:50.625]  Look, we sued and got the SPP documents.
[00:39:51.065 --> 00:39:55.848]  It says they're taking over our freedoms and carbon tax, and they just say it doesn't exist.
[00:39:56.248 --> 00:39:58.770]  And you go, but it's declassified.
[00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:59.430]  It does.
[00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.071]  I mean, I'll never forget.
[00:40:01.111 --> 00:40:01.972]  I keep going back to this.
[00:40:02.192 --> 00:40:03.633]  Two years ago, Ron Paul's running for
[00:40:04.892 --> 00:40:06.833]  President, he just started a year and a half ago, whatever.
[00:40:07.553 --> 00:40:10.014]  CNN and other channels saying, Ron Paul's crazy!
[00:40:10.354 --> 00:40:13.416]  He believes in something called the NAFTA Superhighway and the Trans-Texas Corridor!
[00:40:13.836 --> 00:40:21.239]  And I remember him laughing at Ron Paul on CNN and somebody put a compilation video together of CNN, Fox, CNBC saying he was crazy.
[00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:32.984]  I live in Texas with the NAFTA Highway, Trans-Texas Corridor billboards up and it being announced and I'd go to movies and they have trailers at the start paid for by the government about the NAFTA Superhighway.
[00:40:34.585 --> 00:40:37.447]  This is some type of psych warfare game they play!
[00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:42.211]  Like, I had Psychology Today call me and it was like, so you believe there's a Bilderberg Group?
[00:40:42.871 --> 00:40:46.354]  And I was like, well no, I mean, you know one exists, right?
[00:40:47.494 --> 00:40:53.919]  And the psychiatrist would just kind of go, the psychologist, right in front of him would just go, please continue.
[00:40:53.939 --> 00:41:00.103]  And I'd say, no wait a minute, let's not play these little high and mighty God games where you just say, now you think that exists?
[00:41:00.164 --> 00:41:03.086]  And he'd go, well let me ask you another, are they coming to get you?
[00:41:04.215 --> 00:41:05.796]  See, it's all about how I'm this paranoid.
[00:41:06.056 --> 00:41:09.777]  Meanwhile, foreign banks openly have hijacked us, sucking us dry.
[00:41:10.077 --> 00:41:15.019]  They're openly announcing world government, and it's like the general public that's committed to the lie.
[00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:17.780]  For decades they said none of this existed.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:23.802]  So even as this is being announced it exists and is happening, they can't go back and say they were conned and lied to.
[00:41:24.322 --> 00:41:25.083]  They have to say.
[00:41:25.103 --> 00:41:31.485]  In fact, I have a lot of fake conservatives call me and email me, and I hear it on talk radio, that WMDs were found in Iraq.
[00:41:31.925 --> 00:41:33.066]  That he did have nukes.
[00:41:34.341 --> 00:41:36.262]  I mean, or that they didn't torture.
[00:41:36.763 --> 00:41:43.927]  You know, it's just, they, I'm more and more realizing, Sam, they are the crazy people, we are the normal people.
[00:41:44.148 --> 00:41:44.528]  Go ahead.
[00:41:46.249 --> 00:41:58.417]  Well, I completely agree with you, Alex, and just think about, I mean, it's the writer who admitted that Bilderberg exists most likely five, six years ago.
[00:41:59.133 --> 00:42:00.474]  No, you're right, you're right.
[00:42:00.514 --> 00:42:01.655]  They're losing their mind game.
[00:42:15.186 --> 00:42:19.471]  And the more they say, no, Judicial Watch doesn't have those documents.
[00:42:19.531 --> 00:42:31.943]  The more they say that the best-selling book for a year was the late, great USA that we sell at Infowars.com by Dr. Jerome Corsi, that has those documents, that endgame, you know, number one on Amazon.com film.
[00:42:33.004 --> 00:42:36.327]  The more they deny, the more it gets that they're a bunch of liars.
[00:42:36.467 --> 00:42:36.768]  Go ahead.
[00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:49.187]  Yeah, and anybody doubt anything that I'm reading from here, this pamphlet that I got... Yeah, keep going, I apologize for... Again, recap what you're reading from, where you're at, what you're covering.
[00:42:49.528 --> 00:43:00.516]  Yeah, well, when we met the reporter yesterday, he gave us the schedule of events for the whole thing, but actually it's available online as well if you go to the article that's posted on Prison Planet or InfoWorks.
[00:43:01.304 --> 00:43:05.588]  At the bottom, there is a link to a PDF file, which is the same thing that I have.
[00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:13.316]  So if you doubt what I'm reading you, that there is the Luncheons Entitled Towards Global Governments, etc., you can go check it out.
[00:43:13.336 --> 00:43:15.438]  That's the link to the PDF file online.
[00:43:15.498 --> 00:43:16.319]  It's their own document.
[00:43:18.917 --> 00:43:24.139]  Absolutely, and you were getting into that last point about how they're saying, oh, what should the role be?
[00:43:24.259 --> 00:43:26.180]  Can central banks go too far?
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:37.905]  Or, oh, we can't have nation-states, you know, you have the premier running around, we can't have nation-states dictating the global policy, and then they have a conference called Global Governance?
[00:43:38.225 --> 00:43:38.745]  Continue.
[00:43:39.245 --> 00:43:44.307]  Right, I mean, the title is the required joint action between North American central banks.
[00:43:44.367 --> 00:43:46.108]  In other words, it's not an option anymore.
[00:43:46.468 --> 00:43:47.949]  Both American central banks need
[00:43:48.402 --> 00:43:50.883]  Tell me about the security for this event.
[00:43:50.903 --> 00:43:53.463]  Well, yesterday, like I said, yesterday was a beautiful day.
[00:43:53.523 --> 00:43:57.704]  There was at least 100 protesters outside and quite a long line of police officers out in front.
[00:43:57.804 --> 00:43:58.965]  Today, however, in Montreal,
[00:44:13.356 --> 00:44:16.758]  It's a miserable day, it's raining hard, and there's nobody here.
[00:44:16.778 --> 00:44:24.622]  So like I said, I was able to walk right up into the Hilton, where yesterday there was a huge line of police.
[00:44:25.383 --> 00:44:35.329]  I was just able to walk right in, and I'm sitting here, right, just a few, maybe 10-20 feet from the conference center.
[00:44:35.369 --> 00:44:39.411]  So I'm seeing conference SNDs walk past me the whole time.
[00:44:40.007 --> 00:44:43.003]  I've been before I was waiting for your phone call so I could get on.
[00:44:43.043 --> 00:44:43.485]  I was trying to...
[00:44:44.289 --> 00:44:46.731]  Listen in on any conversations, see if I can hear anything.
[00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:50.853]  But unfortunately, not so far.
[00:44:50.873 --> 00:44:54.235]  You know, you can try to waltz into the conference.
[00:44:54.775 --> 00:44:57.337]  Again, they have the secret Bilderberg where they decide what they're going to do.
[00:44:57.357 --> 00:45:01.419]  Then they have these regional in the US, Canada, Europe, England, Japan.
[00:45:01.459 --> 00:45:02.120]  They admit this.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.642]  Regional systems that are run by the key Bilderberg group people.
[00:45:07.363 --> 00:45:10.045]  And then it fans out into the larger pyramidal power structure.
[00:45:10.445 --> 00:45:12.246]  They go out and then implement the program.
[00:45:15.106 --> 00:45:41.885]  And in the past, we've got messages from the Premier of Quebec, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Mayor of Montreal, the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, he says, in his own little intro to the meeting, says, by this year's theme, Adapting to a New World Order, preparing ourselves for the future is a task no country can assume alone, in isolation from the global community, and I commend you for your dedication to this task.
[00:45:42.731 --> 00:45:48.797]  In other words, Stephen Harper, our own Prime Minister here in Canada, is saying, I commend you for the task of working towards the New World Order.
[00:45:50.879 --> 00:45:54.182]  Yeah, he's on record in the press groveling to the meeting.
[00:45:54.643 --> 00:46:00.348]  Now, I've read that at some of these meetings they allow a little bit of kept press or domesticated press.
[00:46:00.809 --> 00:46:04.993]  Is there any press inside the main conference, or is this quasi-secret?
[00:46:06.168 --> 00:46:12.773]  I haven't seen any here today, but like I said, we had a good interview with the reporter yesterday.
[00:46:12.793 --> 00:46:19.218]  I actually sent it to Rob G. I was hoping he could embed it in the article that you posted on the planet.
[00:46:19.298 --> 00:46:22.400]  He could go back into my email and update the article.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.721]  Yeah, what time did you send that?
[00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:26.744]  And we'll send it to Curt Nemo and Steve Watson.
[00:46:26.764 --> 00:46:28.005]  Paul's on vacation right now.
[00:46:28.025 --> 00:46:33.449]  Okay, well, yeah, it's in the email that I sent you where they actually got the article from.
[00:46:33.629 --> 00:46:34.770]  I added a little link to it.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.201]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:37.241 --> 00:46:39.502]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:39.522 --> 00:46:41.344]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:41.364 --> 00:46:43.045]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:43.065 --> 00:46:44.226]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:44.246 --> 00:46:45.706]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:45.726 --> 00:46:47.688]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:49.189]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:49.209 --> 00:46:50.850]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:52.231]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:54.012]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:54.032 --> 00:46:55.913]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:55.933 --> 00:46:57.234]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:57.254 --> 00:46:59.135]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:46:59.155 --> 00:47:00.596]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:47:00.616 --> 00:47:02.437]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:47:02.457 --> 00:47:04.398]  I wonder why they didn't put the video in the article?
[00:47:04.419 --> 00:47:05.019]  I wonder why
[00:47:06.491 --> 00:47:10.735]  There are, uh, there is, uh, there is media presence here.
[00:47:11.275 --> 00:47:30.512]  Like I said, the Dominic Strauss content of the IMF, he's all over the media up here, and the big soundbite that everybody's talking about from him yesterday is the one where he says that the, uh, there's only a single system of, uh, a single financial system worldwide, and any national regulation doesn't make any sense.
[00:47:31.314 --> 00:47:34.716]  That's his big soundbite from yesterday that the media started.
[00:47:35.076 --> 00:47:39.958]  Heaven forbid the people actually take control from the corporate oligarchy.
[00:47:52.179 --> 00:47:52.759]  God forbid.
[00:47:53.179 --> 00:47:58.300]  Well, sir, folks can visit, of course, Montreal911truth.org.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.001]  The photos and videos, please get those up on YouTube as quickly as possible.
[00:48:02.601 --> 00:48:06.322]  And you had offered, and it's very exciting, to send us any of that footage.
[00:48:06.342 --> 00:48:10.223]  You like to be in the new Obama film that is just unbelievably powerful.
[00:48:10.243 --> 00:48:17.244]  I'm going to go ahead and probably release it now on October 1st instead of July or September because I need more time to make it just incredibly powerful.
[00:48:18.164 --> 00:48:19.665]  But I really appreciate you.
[00:48:19.905 --> 00:48:21.625]  And Sam, anything else you'd like to add?
[00:48:23.627 --> 00:48:26.009]  No, just on MontrealOnline11Truth.org.
[00:48:26.029 --> 00:48:27.809]  Yeah, you can read all about this.
[00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:30.631]  It's our Truth Blast 09.
[00:48:31.431 --> 00:48:38.575]  This summer, we're hitting the streets, and it's going to be very active this summer in Montreal, and this is a part of it.
[00:48:39.315 --> 00:48:42.217]  And I wish you the best of luck, Alex, with your money bomb.
[00:48:42.557 --> 00:48:43.777]  I've been listening to you for years.
[00:48:43.857 --> 00:48:44.678]  I'm a huge fan.
[00:48:45.158 --> 00:48:51.001]  You're one of the only people out there that I trust to deliver me the news, and I wish you all the best there.
[00:48:51.886 --> 00:48:55.929]  Well, God bless you Sam LaBriere, and God bless you for being there covering this event.
[00:48:56.989 --> 00:49:00.052]  It ends, what, on the 11th?
[00:49:00.112 --> 00:49:03.394]  So it ends on Thursday, correct?
[00:49:03.854 --> 00:49:12.080]  Yes, Thursday, with the final luncheon being the one discussing the required joint action between North American Central Banks.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:13.941]  That was the last one.
[00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:18.070]  Well, people need to come out there.
[00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:19.310]  They need to come out and support you.
[00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:34.532]  So give folks the address again, so they can come out tomorrow when the rain subsides and have more people infiltrate with cameras, more people infiltrate this event with the citizen media, so we can find out what these vicious corporate snakes are doing in their buying and selling your leaders.
[00:49:35.873 --> 00:49:41.234]  Yes, it's at 900 LaGocia Chair West, Corner Mansfield in downtown Montreal.
[00:49:41.354 --> 00:49:43.594]  It's at the Hilton Bonaventure Hotel.
[00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:52.792]  And hopefully the rain will subside tomorrow and we can have all the info warriors in Montreal come out and fight the New World Order.
[00:49:53.152 --> 00:49:54.372]  Alright, God bless you my friend.
[00:49:54.432 --> 00:49:58.513]  We will talk to you again with a quick update tomorrow and then again on Thursday, okay?
[00:49:59.334 --> 00:50:00.194]  Okay Alex, take care.
[00:50:00.574 --> 00:50:02.594]  Thank you for taking liberty in your own hands.
[00:50:02.614 --> 00:50:03.495]  Thank you for standing up.
[00:50:03.535 --> 00:50:04.315]  Another great example.
[00:50:04.755 --> 00:50:06.736]  Sam Labreer there joining us.
[00:50:07.176 --> 00:50:11.097]  Okay, quickly, I haven't plugged a sponsor yet to make these shows possible.
[00:50:11.177 --> 00:50:11.997]  One of them is Home Gain.
[00:50:13.186 --> 00:50:18.031]  This is the place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, or getting any real estate questions you have answered.

[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:30.641]  HomeGain.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:30.661 --> 00:50:38.906]  They also have a system, a home sale maximizer, where they can tell you the least expensive renovations or things you can do that will boost the sale of your house.
[00:50:38.926 --> 00:50:42.289]  A lot of things you can do there at HomeGain.com.
[00:50:42.609 --> 00:50:45.050]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.

[00:50:55.350 --> 00:51:00.495]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:19.243]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:51:19.723 --> 00:51:22.365]  Starve or surrender.
[00:51:23.205 --> 00:51:28.048]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:51:28.068 --> 00:51:29.168]  What then?
[00:51:30.931 --> 00:51:33.772]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.

[00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:14.319]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.893 --> 00:52:21.076]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.476 --> 00:52:23.317]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.457 --> 00:52:25.858]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.958 --> 00:52:36.903]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.524 --> 00:52:38.824]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.204 --> 00:52:40.565]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:41.047 --> 00:52:47.392]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.952 --> 00:52:55.758]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.219 --> 00:52:57.360]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.001]  The people strike back.
[00:53:01.152 --> 00:53:02.993]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:53:03.133 --> 00:53:09.816]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:53:10.096 --> 00:53:18.260]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:24.203]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:53:24.383 --> 00:53:26.165]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:53:26.225 --> 00:53:28.387]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:53:28.407 --> 00:53:32.771]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:53:32.952 --> 00:53:35.094]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:53:35.174 --> 00:53:43.282]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:53:43.302 --> 00:53:44.842]  They railed against the crown
[00:54:13.381 --> 00:54:26.706]  Now I've gotten seated, I'm doing work during the breaks, running back in here and the guys have me
[00:54:43.416 --> 00:54:44.836]  Jacking in here to get my audio.
[00:54:44.916 --> 00:54:48.117]  I keep getting emails going, how do you hear your callers now without headphones?
[00:54:48.677 --> 00:54:49.537]  I got an earpiece in.
[00:54:49.557 --> 00:54:51.158]  That's how I'm doing it.
[00:54:51.498 --> 00:54:57.359]  Promise it's not an alien transmitter or anything sent by the Chupacabras working for the Vatican and the Zionists.
[00:54:58.179 --> 00:55:08.521]  Okay ladies and gentlemen, let me get serious here right now in this segment with something we need folks to take action on.
[00:55:09.081 --> 00:55:12.082]  Now whatever you see at your state level
[00:55:13.024 --> 00:55:16.466]  If it's draconian and evil and corrupt, you're going to see in other states.
[00:55:17.467 --> 00:55:34.318]  And I learned last Friday, when Curt Nemo posted a story on Infowars.com, that a bill through a legislative corrupt process that the House and Senate rules have been changed to do, bills are supposed to come out of committee, then get voted on by the full House or Senate.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:35.520]  I don't think so.
[00:55:48.151 --> 00:55:48.912]  You can read the bill.
[00:55:49.292 --> 00:55:54.997]  It states clearly CPS can take any children, not just with a warrant or with a fake judge's order.
[00:55:55.517 --> 00:55:58.300]  They get these fake things sworn on every day by these child kidnapper judges.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.322]  They have special, you know, scumbag judges all over the country.
[00:56:01.362 --> 00:56:01.983]  It's been in the news.
[00:56:02.243 --> 00:56:04.485]  They get kicked back some money or like to pedophile the kids.
[00:56:05.646 --> 00:56:07.668]  Yesterday, you gave me the article, I didn't cover it.
[00:56:07.688 --> 00:56:14.032]  The day before that, Rob Dew gave me one, of head of CPS, head of Children's Services, a pedophile ring.
[00:56:14.572 --> 00:56:15.153]  Google that.
[00:56:15.193 --> 00:56:16.173]  I want to show folks that.
[00:56:16.193 --> 00:56:17.614]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:56:18.035 --> 00:56:20.937]  Every day, these disgusting... And it's always the head guys.
[00:56:22.042 --> 00:56:23.823]  Because that's who runs this.
[00:56:24.423 --> 00:56:26.545]  Most of your big family court judges are pedophiles.
[00:56:26.985 --> 00:56:27.845]  Or they're getting cash.
[00:56:27.885 --> 00:56:28.946]  And that's come out on CNN.
[00:56:29.286 --> 00:56:31.287]  That they get millions for the kidnapped kids.
[00:56:31.727 --> 00:56:33.769]  Because see, the adoption agencies are getting $200, $300, $400, $500.
[00:56:34.909 --> 00:56:39.072]  Why do they put over two-thirds of the kids on drugs that they grab?
[00:56:39.952 --> 00:56:43.494]  Because then it's a special needs child and the cash level starts going up.
[00:56:43.934 --> 00:56:45.535]  But if it's a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, you're talking $400, $500,000.
[00:56:47.659 --> 00:56:51.361]  That's why we've had senators on here to tell you they got bounties on the kids.
[00:56:51.901 --> 00:56:58.284]  Now, Senator Kirk Watson, state senator, I've been battling him since I first got on the air in 1995-96.
[00:56:58.625 --> 00:57:04.488]  Former mayor of Austin, owns his own private lamb grab bank outside Austin.
[00:57:04.508 --> 00:57:06.909]  He rules all the farms and ranches the city stole.
[00:57:07.449 --> 00:57:09.970]  He literally is like a, just a demonic goblin.
[00:57:10.591 --> 00:57:12.092]  He has introduced
[00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:20.395]  SB1440 that was a good anti-CPS bill, then he got it and tagged something on.
[00:57:20.435 --> 00:57:21.777]  It goes the reverse now in Texas.
[00:57:22.317 --> 00:57:23.958]  And it's gone to Rick Perry's desk.
[00:57:24.639 --> 00:57:31.084]  And if Perry doesn't pass this, they'll come out on the news and demonize him with all the dirt they got on him.
[00:57:31.304 --> 00:57:32.445]  That's why they love Perry.
[00:57:32.485 --> 00:57:33.426]  That's why he's been to Bilderberg.
[00:57:34.471 --> 00:57:41.359]  But, uh, if we put enough pressure on Rick Perry, he may, uh, not totally annihilate the Fourth Amendment.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:48.708]  And in the two or three years it takes for this to get to the Supreme Court of Texas, before it gets struck down, they may not even do that, they'll kidnap tens of thousands more.
[00:57:49.008 --> 00:57:52.792]  And I mean, no judge, no jury, they just take your kids, period, they're gone.
[00:57:53.473 --> 00:57:55.214]  Pedophile Ring wants them, they get them.
[00:57:55.775 --> 00:57:56.696]  Open season.
[00:57:56.716 --> 00:58:00.058]  Because see, they got in trouble for kidnapping 400 kids last year.
[00:58:00.078 --> 00:58:01.119]  That's what it reports on here.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.683]  And so they got in trouble with the Supreme Court doing a no due process, no orders, no judges order.
[00:58:06.904 --> 00:58:10.226]  So now, Kirk Watson, have you ever seen him in a restaurant anywhere?
[00:58:10.246 --> 00:58:13.008]  You just walk up and tell him he's a piece of trash.
[00:58:13.369 --> 00:58:14.670]  And he's a carpetbagger as well.
[00:58:15.646 --> 00:58:16.246]  Piece of filth.
[00:58:16.907 --> 00:58:19.169]  SB1440.
[00:58:19.869 --> 00:58:24.372]  Call Governor Perry's office phone at 512-463-2000.
[00:58:24.392 --> 00:58:24.572]  512-463-2000.
[00:58:25.093 --> 00:58:31.538]  Fax the degenerate at 512-463-1849.
[00:58:31.678 --> 00:58:34.860]  He's gonna sign this if we don't put heat on him.
[00:58:36.341 --> 00:58:37.922]  Just keep your hands off our children.
[00:58:37.982 --> 00:58:44.187]  It's enough you urinate on the Bill of Rights, but our children... Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:51.004 --> 00:58:56.546]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:58.027]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:58:58.167 --> 00:59:02.048]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[00:59:02.421 --> 00:59:03.982]  My wife just loves the stuff.

[00:59:56.312 --> 00:59:59.114]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.563 --> 01:00:09.746]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:11.207]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.988 --> 01:00:12.888]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:17.212]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.732 --> 01:00:21.815]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.576 --> 01:00:28.360]  We've now reached the halfway point of this worldwide transmission on this Tuesday.
[01:00:31.343 --> 01:00:33.805]  June 9, 2009.
[01:00:34.285 --> 01:00:38.788]  Just come on in, because you've got to sit there at the door and then I'm going to wait and not talk until you get it to me.
[01:00:39.188 --> 01:00:39.608]  Thank you.
[01:00:39.728 --> 01:00:40.368]  Thank you for that.
[01:00:41.449 --> 01:00:41.789]  Thank you.
[01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:43.991]  Yeah, this is the Daily World.
[01:00:44.591 --> 01:00:48.133]  Former CPS Director sentenced to 10 years for child molestation.
[01:00:48.734 --> 01:00:50.715]  Now, I haven't
[01:00:51.653 --> 01:00:53.855]  Created a computer file on this, but I should.
[01:00:53.875 --> 01:01:01.643]  About 80% of the time I hear about a kid being boiled to death or being tortured to death or being found in a cage, starved to death.
[01:01:04.406 --> 01:01:15.297]  They admit deep in the articles that it was a CPS worker or some lazy pot-bellied PhD for social work who
[01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:22.795]  They'll warehouse five, six kids, put them in cages, I'm not kidding, or lock them up in rooms, barely feed them enough to live.
[01:01:23.035 --> 01:01:24.696]  You'll think they're concentration camp victims.
[01:01:26.257 --> 01:01:29.820]  I did service work in college some, and would go in the houses and say, what are these houses?
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:36.245]  And, you know, the older, or the people that knew more about the job would say, oh, this is a foster house.
[01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:39.083]  These are death pedophile pits, basically.
[01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:43.467]  And then they admit they're seven times, I keep saying five times more likely to abuse.
[01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:48.792]  That was the cover of Newsweek in 2000, about five times more likely to abuse children.
[01:01:49.092 --> 01:01:50.653]  It's now seven times more likely.
[01:01:51.414 --> 01:01:53.035]  I mean, there's no group worse than these people.
[01:01:53.936 --> 01:01:57.780]  And it says, a former CPS director sentenced to 10 years for child molestation.
[01:01:59.406 --> 01:02:02.268]  Judge rejects recommendation for a year in jail and treatment.
[01:02:02.749 --> 01:02:10.255]  Gary E. Anderson leaned into the podium, his head lowered, and his blue jail jumpsuit draped off his thin frame.
[01:02:10.795 --> 01:02:19.582]  The 67-year-old child protective services director told the court he did not understand how he could have spent 36 years of his life defending children.
[01:02:20.043 --> 01:02:20.443]  You didn't!
[01:02:20.463 --> 01:02:21.424]  You went in there to rape them!
[01:02:22.674 --> 01:02:24.535]  Because you... Oh, you piece of trash.
[01:02:25.215 --> 01:02:30.518]  Including his own, and now stands guilty of raping a nine-year-old girl and molesting another girl of the same age.
[01:02:31.279 --> 01:02:34.040]  Because you're a bucket of crap.
[01:02:34.841 --> 01:02:36.181]  Because you're a worm.
[01:02:36.201 --> 01:02:38.863]  And because you don't just enjoy raping those children.
[01:02:39.636 --> 01:02:58.571]  For the same reason you enjoy, if you read the criminology and the psychology of why you like raping children, it's the same thing you like when those parents are crying, when you show up with brainwashed cops serving you and they drag that little kid out of their hands and you realize you're going to be raping them in just a few hours.
[01:03:00.512 --> 01:03:03.955]  It's the enjoyment, it's the domination, it's the power
[01:03:05.447 --> 01:03:10.910]  So you enjoy those parents terrorizing in pain, just like local family court judges, and I've been in their courts watching them.
[01:03:11.211 --> 01:03:13.392]  When those families are crying, the judge is literally just going...
[01:03:15.043 --> 01:03:17.045]  I mean, they're just soaking the pain in me.
[01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:24.231]  I'm like, that's why I can't go to these anymore, because it's literally like I'm in hell and I'm going, it's just tearing my guts out, my soul out.
[01:03:24.871 --> 01:03:29.054]  And it just, the rage just lifts and the judge will even see it in your eyes and just look at you.
[01:03:29.094 --> 01:03:36.380]  And it's almost like Emperor Palpatine when Darth Vader finds out he's killed his wife and, and Darth Vader is having a painful moment.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.525]  You see Palpatine going, well, I've seen that in judge Jean mirror, ladies and gentlemen, I've seen her.
[01:03:44.229 --> 01:03:45.069]  When they're taking kids.
[01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:53.071]  And I mean, literally, it's just like, I just want to that lady.
[01:03:54.171 --> 01:03:56.752]  I mean, she is a bucket of maggot evil.
[01:03:56.972 --> 01:03:59.653]  She is a pet demon of hell itself.
[01:04:00.413 --> 01:04:09.555]  And all over the country, the family court judges could get caught getting massive payoffs for stealing kids from the adoption agencies, not to mention the federal bounties to do it.
[01:04:11.124 --> 01:04:15.686]  And I've seen them just, as they take a little kid, and the parents are crying, we didn't do anything, you have no proof!
[01:04:15.866 --> 01:04:35.596]  And she's like, ha ha ha, she'll even, I've seen her on the news before, I've played the clip somewhere, it's a CBS clip, where she's sitting there seizing people's kids, for no reason, in the schools, in the elementary schools, when the kid's late to class, they then make them sign a form, agreeing that they were truant, then when they're late again, they grab them, and when the parents are crying, you see Mir going,
[01:04:37.383 --> 01:04:40.704]  I mean, it's just like feeding vampirically on pain.
[01:04:41.304 --> 01:04:46.806]  And that's what he did right here, another disgusting piece of absolute trash, Gary E. Anderson.
[01:04:47.506 --> 01:04:49.146]  And you look at them, they always look the same.
[01:04:49.167 --> 01:04:51.527]  Look at that weak, pedophile piece of filth.
[01:04:51.827 --> 01:04:53.308]  Loves hurting innocent, weak people.
[01:04:53.508 --> 01:04:55.048]  Loves using the police to have his way.
[01:04:55.228 --> 01:04:58.849]  I bet that bailiff right there was probably helping him a month earlier grab people's kids.
[01:04:59.169 --> 01:05:00.530]  Look at that sack of demon!
[01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:06.190]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:10.191]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:10.431 --> 01:05:16.033]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:21.174]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.394 --> 01:05:25.415]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.737]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.960]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[01:05:44.031 --> 01:05:45.352]  A long time sponsor of ours.

[01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:07.497]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:06:07.637 --> 01:06:10.400]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.464]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:06:13.664 --> 01:06:18.350]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:19.530]  If you simply prepare.
[01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:22.651]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:06:22.952 --> 01:06:29.854]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:08:01.637 --> 01:08:03.858]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:07.279]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.021]  Some stations don't carry that first five-minute segment of each hour.
[01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:22.783]  For those that just joined us, I was covering the fact that every day, without even searching for the articles, they must mean every hour.
[01:08:24.841 --> 01:08:45.457]  Every day I run into mainstream news articles where CPS Directors, Homeland Security Directors are caught raping kids, running child porn, and here is, this is out of the Daily World, former CPS Director sentenced to 10 years for child molestation, and he pleads guilty to raping all these kids.
[01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:51.521]  I've broken a sacred trust, not only with these children, but those who love them.
[01:08:51.721 --> 01:08:52.122]  Oh yeah.
[01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.141]  He said, Friday, I broke their hearts.
[01:08:55.241 --> 01:08:56.682]  I'm sorry for what I've done.
[01:08:58.123 --> 01:09:04.349]  Anderson pled guilty to first-degree child rape and first-degree molestation last year for numerous times.
[01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:07.211]  And it goes on to how he raped little girls.
[01:09:09.753 --> 01:09:14.478]  And, folks, literally they will use these rapists against parents.
[01:09:15.338 --> 01:09:20.203]  Every time they catch a CPS worker raping kids or torturing them or killing them, the news will say,
[01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:29.794]  Woman arrested for killing children, or woman arrested for scalding child, and then you'll say the last paragraph that she was a CPS worker or a foster parent.
[01:09:30.474 --> 01:09:32.415]  Now, am I saying there aren't some good foster parents?
[01:09:32.956 --> 01:09:33.476]  I know there are.
[01:09:33.796 --> 01:09:36.277]  The issue is the system's evil and it's run by pedophiles.
[01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:46.603]  I've probably seen no exaggeration, probably 300, 400 mainstream news articles over the years of CPS directors of whole states
[01:09:47.665 --> 01:09:48.886]  And whole counties and cities.
[01:09:49.306 --> 01:09:52.327]  There was a scandal five years ago in Florida because of thousands of missing kids.
[01:09:52.367 --> 01:09:55.108]  We pulled CNN up last week, showing it to you.
[01:09:56.469 --> 01:10:07.694]  We're going to our next guest in a moment, where they would fire one director for being a convicted pedophile, and the next director would be a pedophile, and then the next director was a pedophile.
[01:10:07.934 --> 01:10:09.715]  Because it's a pedophile guild!
[01:10:11.215 --> 01:10:14.577]  I mean, when I get up here and I say it's run by pedophiles, it is!
[01:10:16.311 --> 01:10:17.172]  That's one side.
[01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:22.015]  The other side is just greedy bastards that don't care, use the pedophiles to grab the kids.
[01:10:22.315 --> 01:10:24.837]  They get to have their way with them and they just get cold hard cash.
[01:10:26.979 --> 01:10:34.023]  There's another small group that is mentally ill people who were abused as children who are out, quote, punishing the family and believe it's a disease.
[01:10:34.784 --> 01:10:35.705]  That's a subgroup.
[01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:37.646]  I'd say they're 20%.
[01:10:38.927 --> 01:10:45.812]  The pedophiles, I'd have to guesstimate, but I'd say 40% of CPS workers and foster parents are pedophiles.
[01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:47.864]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:10:53.427 --> 01:10:57.749]  And, uh, he's getting ten years in prison for raping all these kids.
[01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:09.556]  But what about the issue of there have been cases where school teachers are pedophiles, they like a particular kid, they call their pedophile buddies in CPS and grab the kid and then
[01:11:10.592 --> 01:11:11.613]  Rape them for themselves.
[01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:14.636]  I mean, it's like grocery shopping at the schools for them.
[01:11:14.876 --> 01:11:16.277]  The pedophile guilds are everywhere.
[01:11:16.918 --> 01:11:21.221]  And they did this in Rome, they did this in many other kingdoms.
[01:11:21.702 --> 01:11:24.204]  They recruit more of their people in.
[01:11:24.744 --> 01:11:28.387]  I mean, I know somebody in the office next to me that worked for the city of San Marcos.
[01:11:28.427 --> 01:11:37.075]  If I told you about what two senior police commanders, and this guy I know doesn't lie, two senior police commanders have a sex slave at their house.
[01:11:37.555 --> 01:11:38.796]  And nobody's going to stop them.
[01:11:39.436 --> 01:11:45.600]  It's going to continue, and they're going to do what they want, when they want, and if they want your kids, they're going to come get them.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:48.982]  Because they got armored vehicles and automatic weapons.
[01:11:50.303 --> 01:11:55.707]  Now, if we rise up and rebuke them for what they are, and point out what they are, they will fall.
[01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.771]  Now, I have the video from Endgame.
[01:12:02.992 --> 01:12:03.772]  We ought to pull this up.
[01:12:03.812 --> 01:12:04.713]  I should have thought to do that.
[01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:17.540]  Where the head psychiatrist for the state of Texas tells the state board in the legislature that why are 68% of kids on psychotropics in Texas?
[01:12:18.822 --> 01:12:21.605]  And the guy said because they got bad genes, eugenics.
[01:12:22.787 --> 01:12:23.628]  That's their excuse.
[01:12:25.796 --> 01:12:29.838]  Now due process isn't being followed with these family courts and tomorrow there's a press conference coming up.
[01:12:29.858 --> 01:12:31.680]  We're going to have somebody on dealing with it.
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.241]  Call Governor Rick Perry to veto SB 1440.
[01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:42.461]  It ends completely the Fourth and Fifth Amendment, allows the police to take your children like they're Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:42.641 --> 01:12:46.004]  You know, we're just grabbing Al-Qaeda in America and secretly grabbing them.
[01:12:46.044 --> 01:12:50.007]  Oh no, now it's your kids in Texas and other states have introduced similar bills.
[01:12:50.528 --> 01:12:56.632]  This bill was even improperly changed after the House passed it by Kirk Watson, the demonic senator.
[01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:57.713]  Literally demonic.
[01:12:58.133 --> 01:12:59.394]  Pure evil flows from this guy.
[01:12:59.574 --> 01:13:00.675]  Been battling him for 14 years.
[01:13:02.338 --> 01:13:05.400]  Now a state senator was the mayor, and it goes directly to him.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:18.086]  Call Governor Perry's office and tell him not to vote on child kidnapping, and not to vote for the end of the Fourth Amendment, where they can take your children, no judge, no jury, not even a fake order, they just take your kids.
[01:13:18.867 --> 01:13:21.868]  And folks, they take them, and they rape them.
[01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:25.010]  They rape babies.
[01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:25.770]  They don't care.
[01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:31.313]  And a lot of one of their favorite things to do is to grab your kid and rape them, and then say you did it, and put you in prison for it.
[01:13:35.063 --> 01:13:35.763]  I'm not joking!
[01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:40.165]  Pedophiles are running most of your major governments, okay?
[01:13:40.185 --> 01:13:46.448]  In fact, I ought to do a whole program on the hundreds and hundreds of cases of Homeland Security officials caught doing it.
[01:13:47.068 --> 01:13:54.311]  In fact, Google, Homeland Security official caught with child porn, or Head of State Children's Bureau, New Jersey, caught raping children.
[01:13:54.511 --> 01:13:56.371]  I mean, I see, that's what I saw last week!
[01:13:57.292 --> 01:13:58.152]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[01:13:58.812 --> 01:13:59.893]  I'm going to shut up right there.
[01:14:01.328 --> 01:14:07.813]  Because I got a guest on, and I apologize, you've got to hear this type of stuff, but it all integrates into the same situation.
[01:14:08.214 --> 01:14:16.200]  Evil has taken over, and set up a system where evil is good and good is evil, and where they can carry out all their evil, and then make us the good people bad.
[01:14:16.681 --> 01:14:18.122]  And legitimize all their crap.
[01:14:20.151 --> 01:14:25.955]  Now, are you going to let them Abu Ghraib your children, and your kids just disappear, and they don't even tell you where they went?
[01:14:26.015 --> 01:14:27.435]  No judge, no jury, no order.
[01:14:28.036 --> 01:14:31.178]  So that rapists can have their way with your children.
[01:14:31.398 --> 01:14:36.841]  There is no group more dangerous than a truancy officer, or a CPS worker, or a foster parent.
[01:14:37.802 --> 01:14:38.442]  Period!
[01:14:41.124 --> 01:14:47.688]  Do you understand that most of the time when I hear about somebody arrested for pedophilia, it's a CPS director?
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.220]  See, the cops aren't bad, folks.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.721]  They're not pedophiles on average.
[01:14:53.001 --> 01:14:54.201]  They're just like the general public.
[01:14:54.642 --> 01:14:56.422]  You have the same sample right with them in the studies.
[01:14:56.922 --> 01:14:58.783]  They know the CPS is pedophiles.
[01:14:58.923 --> 01:15:01.083]  That's why they're constantly busting them doing it!
[01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:04.584]  I'm not saying something here the police don't know.
[01:15:05.445 --> 01:15:07.165]  It is a fact!
[01:15:07.825 --> 01:15:09.026]  And I am sick of it!
[01:15:13.387 --> 01:15:17.888]  I'll be at the mall every once in a while, in a grocery store, and I'll see some, like, fat, demonic creature going,
[01:15:19.761 --> 01:15:20.284]  Looking at me?
[01:15:21.499 --> 01:15:23.780]  And I'll go, oh, that's a CPS worker that hates my guts.
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.801]  That's a pedophile right there.
[01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:30.965]  And they'll just like see me and go... And then one time I was in the Target parking lot and saw the little gremlin getting in his car.
[01:15:31.005 --> 01:15:31.585]  He didn't see me.
[01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:33.006]  We, I guess, had left there at the same time.
[01:15:33.286 --> 01:15:37.989]  And it said, safe children and the names of these different groups on the back as he was driving off.
[01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:39.670]  And I was like, it just hit me like adrenaline.
[01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:41.171]  I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, it is one.
[01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:41.831]  Oh, my God.
[01:15:42.111 --> 01:15:43.032]  God, I've got discernment.
[01:15:43.112 --> 01:15:43.352]  Please.
[01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:44.713]  It's just so crazy.
[01:15:44.893 --> 01:15:47.294]  Just like, oh, there's one of the demons right there.
[01:15:47.554 --> 01:15:48.715]  You know, my instinct is just to...
[01:15:50.953 --> 01:16:09.441]  You know, clean house, folks, but I mean, literally, then I got behind him in the car, because I saw him inside 30 minutes before, leaving, see him, see him there, he doesn't see me, read his license, his bumper stickers, and then literally just, you know, hit, you know, wanted to hit you, and I was like, oh, it's a demon, it actually is one.
[01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:13.243]  I mean, there he is, he's going to go on, he's probably going to grab a kid right then.
[01:16:13.863 --> 01:16:18.625]  He's probably, he just can't wait to rape a six-month-old baby, and he's going to blame the parents for it.
[01:16:19.599 --> 01:16:24.621]  They'll grab your kid, they go rape it that night in the examination, and then they come and blame you for it.
[01:16:25.061 --> 01:16:32.644]  I have had it with you, and I swear one thing on the eternal altar of God, we're going to bring you to justice, no matter what it takes, filth!
[01:16:34.304 --> 01:16:35.005]  I apologize.
[01:16:35.085 --> 01:16:37.146]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:39.566]  I can't handle the stuff I've seen.
[01:16:39.686 --> 01:16:42.788]  I can't handle these people, knowing nobody's stopping them.
[01:16:43.008 --> 01:16:48.690]  They just go on, and on, and on, and on, and on, committing their evil!
[01:16:53.308 --> 01:17:00.318]  And if I see one more pot-bellied, stick-armed, ball-headed, pedophile, CPS worker, I don't think I can handle it.
[01:17:03.462 --> 01:17:04.163]  They're bullies!
[01:17:04.183 --> 01:17:05.365]  They like hurting children!
[01:17:06.286 --> 01:17:07.388]  And I hate your guts!
[01:17:12.264 --> 01:17:12.764]  That's the problem.
[01:17:12.784 --> 01:17:14.905]  As I get older, I can't stand seeing things be abused.
[01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:16.765]  I can't even go hunting anymore because I can't.
[01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:17.686]  I know it's stupid.
[01:17:17.706 --> 01:17:18.726]  I don't even like shooting deer.
[01:17:18.806 --> 01:17:24.208]  If a lizard accidentally gets its tail cut off when I close my door, I almost cry.
[01:17:24.648 --> 01:17:26.649]  And then I think about kids, how they're killing them.
[01:17:26.749 --> 01:17:27.369]  I apologize.
[01:17:27.389 --> 01:17:28.129]  I'm going to go to our guest.
[01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.729]  We're getting mad.
[01:17:29.710 --> 01:17:31.570]  Let's go to Betty Henderson.
[01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:33.651]  She runs SSRI website.
[01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:44.097]  SSRIstories.com with over 3,000 cases of what happens when you put people on these drugs.
[01:17:44.477 --> 01:17:49.501]  Ma'am, it's good to have you here and we appreciate you taking the tens of thousands of hours to compile the website.
[01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:50.982]  Oh, thank you very much.
[01:17:52.163 --> 01:17:56.746]  I'm sorry you had to hear that whole rant, but are you aware about the CPS people?
[01:17:57.327 --> 01:17:57.967]  No, I wasn't.
[01:18:01.049 --> 01:18:02.110]  I don't usually get that heated.
[01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:07.374]  They're trying to pass a bill where they can kidnap anybody's kids without any due process.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:10.081]  Well, yes, that's not good.
[01:18:11.283 --> 01:18:14.306]  And that's bad enough with supposed al-Qaeda, but now our little kids?
[01:18:14.867 --> 01:18:15.147]  Right.
[01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:19.672]  Well, our little kids are having a bad time with these antidepressants, too, I'll tell you.
[01:18:20.413 --> 01:18:20.913]  Absolutely.
[01:18:21.114 --> 01:18:23.316]  Well, tell folks about the site and what you've compiled.
[01:18:23.937 --> 01:18:24.357]  Okay.
[01:18:24.538 --> 01:18:28.021]  SSRIstories.com is the website that contains 3,109
[01:18:31.227 --> 01:18:46.140]  Media articles where an antidepressant was mentioned and a criminal activity either of violence or murder, murder-suicide or suicide or arson was committed and right there in the media articles.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.661]  See, these aren't personal stories.
[01:18:47.761 --> 01:18:53.066]  These are stories that appeared in newspapers and some journal articles around the country.
[01:18:54.187 --> 01:18:59.371]  And we believe that, in fact, Japan just recently passed
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:00.781]  I don't know.
[01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:22.533]  We're about to go to break and come back, and I'm going to try to shut up and let you go through all this.
[01:19:22.573 --> 01:19:24.635]  We're really honored to have you on, the great work you've done.
[01:19:25.075 --> 01:19:29.559]  When did you first start compiling SSRIstories.com?
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:30.640]  Uh, 1997.
[01:19:33.863 --> 01:19:34.844]  Well, it is hellish, ma'am.
[01:19:34.864 --> 01:19:36.985]  We're going to come back in just a few minutes, and I'm going to give you the floor.
[01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:39.067]  I want you to break down these stories.
[01:19:39.448 --> 01:19:40.328]  Okay, I will.
[01:19:40.388 --> 01:19:40.749]  Thank you.
[01:19:41.175 --> 01:19:45.780]  You bet, and it's people like you that have forced Prozac to put it on their own.
[01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:50.085]  Insert with a drug that it causes psychopathic behavior and murder and suicide.
[01:19:51.547 --> 01:19:58.395]  And every mass shooter I've seen, every killer, every time some woman kills her kids, they're always on this stuff because it's in the hallucinogen class.
[01:19:58.755 --> 01:19:59.356]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.647 --> 01:20:07.613]  If you've always wanted to experience the amazing benefits from using oil of oregano, the time to act is now!

[01:20:57.864 --> 01:21:07.030]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:14.535]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:21.286]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:21.606 --> 01:21:23.508]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:23.648 --> 01:21:26.050]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:26.151 --> 01:21:37.101]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:21:37.708 --> 01:21:39.008]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.368 --> 01:21:40.809]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:47.610]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:56.392 --> 01:21:57.552]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.972 --> 01:21:59.252]  The people strike back.
[01:22:02.673 --> 01:22:03.793]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:04.246 --> 01:22:09.731]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:10.792]  That's right.
[01:22:11.112 --> 01:22:13.394]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:22:13.955 --> 01:22:20.921]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:22:21.442 --> 01:22:27.167]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs.
[01:22:27.587 --> 01:22:29.109]  Yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:34.422]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:22:35.042 --> 01:22:40.064]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:40.864 --> 01:22:44.986]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[01:23:02.245 --> 01:23:03.105]  Spring is here.
[01:23:03.366 --> 01:23:04.146]  Growing season.
[01:23:04.326 --> 01:23:06.307]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:23:06.527 --> 01:23:07.928]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:23:08.228 --> 01:23:08.908]  Think about it.
[01:23:09.209 --> 01:23:13.071]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:23:13.291 --> 01:23:16.772]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:23:16.993 --> 01:23:19.554]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.

[01:24:58.018 --> 01:25:03.160]  Betty Henderson, SSRIstories.com, up on screen right now as we simulcast it.
[01:25:03.801 --> 01:25:04.861]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:25:04.901 --> 01:25:11.404]  We've got Ron Paul on the show tomorrow, a bunch of other big guests throughout the week, and I'm going to have some shows where we take a lot of phone calls.
[01:25:11.865 --> 01:25:15.867]  Next hour we will open phones up with Wayne Madsen, joining us on a host of issues.
[01:25:16.487 --> 01:25:18.688]  Okay, ma'am, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:19.108 --> 01:25:20.689]  Get rolling with these stories.
[01:25:21.409 --> 01:25:23.830]  3,000 plus, you've got categorized there.
[01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:26.732]  I mean, everybody knows, it's common sense that
[01:25:27.625 --> 01:25:34.089]  That most of the mass shooters, almost all of them, women killing their kids, they're always on Prozac-type drugs.
[01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:41.092]  Let's go through some of those stories and why the science shows, and why they now have to admit, that it causes these types of behaviors.
[01:25:41.993 --> 01:25:48.196]  Well, first of all, I want to say that anybody that's taking these drugs, do not, under any circumstances, withdraw from them abruptly.
[01:25:48.937 --> 01:25:54.840]  In fact, on our website cover page, it says withdrawal can often be more dangerous than continuing on the medication.
[01:25:55.549 --> 01:26:07.539]  It's important to withdraw extremely slowly from these drugs, usually over a period of a year or more, under the supervision of somebody who's qualified to understand what is happening when you withdraw.
[01:26:08.019 --> 01:26:08.479]  Okay?
[01:26:10.081 --> 01:26:10.381]  Hello?
[01:26:10.401 --> 01:26:12.783]  Oh yes, go ahead.
[01:26:12.823 --> 01:26:20.429]  I wanted to explain about that withdrawal and how dangerous you can go into withdrawal mania and commit suicide or violence.
[01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:21.290]  In fact,
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.771]  Last school shooting we had, the University of Northern Illinois, he was in a three-week withdrawal from Prozac.
[01:26:29.571 --> 01:26:34.872]  Yeah, for those that don't know, it creates a chemical imbalance, so you have to go off very, very slowly.
[01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:47.075]  And a lot of the mass shootings are when psychiatrists or psychologists change the medication, or when the person gets locked up in jail and they don't give it to them, then they release them three days later, completely out of their minds.
[01:26:47.115 --> 01:26:47.455]  Go ahead.
[01:26:47.555 --> 01:26:53.197]  Yeah, just going into jail, being on antidepressants, and then going off from them in jail, and then being released.
[01:26:53.357 --> 01:26:54.357]  Oh, that's so dangerous.
[01:26:54.977 --> 01:26:55.637]  So dangerous.
[01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:58.078]  The convicts are more dangerous than they used to be.
[01:26:59.648 --> 01:27:00.728]  It's just really tragic.
[01:27:01.328 --> 01:27:13.931]  But what I was going to say was that the time that it's most dangerous for this violence and criminal activity and suicide to take place is when you are beginning the drug or when you're stopping the drug.
[01:27:14.691 --> 01:27:22.833]  When you're increasing the dose or decreasing the dose or when you're switching from one antidepressant to another antidepressant.
[01:27:23.233 --> 01:27:24.814]  Those are the really dangerous times.
[01:27:27.219 --> 01:27:56.121]  We went ahead and decided that we were going to let as many people as possible know about the dangers of these drugs and so we put up SSRIstories.com and since the Japanese have warned about the warnings on how dangerous these drugs are and that there's a causal relationship, I think that people should know that between 30 to 50 million people in the United States, because actually
[01:27:57.256 --> 01:28:08.039]  One out of six people has tried these drugs at one time or another, and currently one out of ten people is taking one of these antidepressants.
[01:28:08.379 --> 01:28:13.700]  These drugs, right there in the physician's desk reference, it says that they can cause mania and psychosis.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:25.423]  So we have 30 to 40 million people taking a drug that could potentially cause mania and psychosis, and in the physician's desk reference, this is not even listed as a rare reaction.
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:32.624]  Are you familiar with the studies that have been done in Europe?
[01:28:33.365 --> 01:28:33.585]  Yes.
[01:28:34.365 --> 01:28:45.193]  Clearly showing that it causes people to have these psychotic breaks and can even cause people to have hallucinations because these drugs are in the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, psychotropics are in the hallucinogen class?
[01:28:45.573 --> 01:28:46.334]  Yes, they are.
[01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:54.680]  In fact, 200,000 people a year or more will go into a hospital with an antidepressant and do psychosis.
[01:28:57.458 --> 01:29:00.139]  That's right up there in SSI Stories, it's a journal article.
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:11.985]  It, you know, and so these drugs can cause hallucinations and that's one of the things that's listed, but let me go through the adverse reactions that's listed here.
[01:29:12.706 --> 01:29:22.190]  Manic reaction, that's different kinds of mania including kleptomania, pyromania, that's arson, schizomania, it has, there's alcohol cravings there.
[01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:25.252]  It causes abnormal thinking and hallucinations.
[01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:36.074]  Personality disorders, amnesia, emotional instability, it can cause alcohol abuse and a craving for alcohol.
[01:29:36.514 --> 01:29:42.618]  It can cause hostility, antidepressants, especially the SSRIs can cause paranoid reactions.
[01:29:42.698 --> 01:29:49.161]  Stay there Betty Henderson, the government admits this, the FDA admits this, but they want to put basically all the school kids on it.
[01:29:51.622 --> 01:29:54.504]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.513 --> 01:29:58.375]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.057 --> 01:30:09.723]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:30:10.143 --> 01:30:14.847]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:30:15.307 --> 01:30:17.889]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[01:30:18.309 --> 01:30:18.710]  I think so.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:45.848]  Marine Photoplankton, Maca, Goji Berries, Raw Chocolate Cacao, Nibs, Noni, Immune Detox, and more.
[01:30:46.148 --> 01:30:47.710]  Folks, you gotta check these out.

[01:31:00.854 --> 01:31:06.437]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:07.878]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:31:08.018 --> 01:31:12.020]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called InnerFood.
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.861]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:31:14.161 --> 01:31:19.044]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award.
[01:31:19.346 --> 01:31:19.867]  We're good to go.
[01:31:40.006 --> 01:31:42.187]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:31:42.407 --> 01:31:44.668]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.

[01:32:00.916 --> 01:32:05.917]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:32:06.137 --> 01:32:09.918]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:10.158 --> 01:32:15.760]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:20.921]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:21.121 --> 01:32:25.162]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.382 --> 01:32:27.463]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:32:27.483 --> 01:32:30.684]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:45.971]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:32:45.991 --> 01:32:48.851]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:33:39.558 --> 01:33:44.801]  Okay, Betty Henderson, SSRIstories.com.
[01:33:46.081 --> 01:33:52.984]  So you put together this site with 3,000 cases of people on psychotropics, killing themselves, killing others, and doing insane things.
[01:33:54.645 --> 01:33:59.327]  They admit, in the desk reference for these drugs, that it causes all the things you were mentioning.
[01:33:59.828 --> 01:34:03.610]  You had gotten up to, uh, paranoid delusional.
[01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:04.290]  Please continue.
[01:34:04.927 --> 01:34:11.451]  Oh, well, these are just some of the physician's desk reference, you know, lists the adverse reactions.
[01:34:12.072 --> 01:34:24.460]  And if you look at it, and you'll see, like, for instance, in Prozac, confusion is a frequent side effect, and so is amnesia, and so is agitation, and so are sleep disorders.
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:27.442]  Sleep disorders include terrible nightmares.
[01:34:27.502 --> 01:34:29.003]  Some people have terrible nightmares.
[01:34:29.603 --> 01:34:32.605]  And then, since the drugs suppress the REM sleep,
[01:34:33.317 --> 01:34:35.699]  And release your muscles so that you can act.
[01:34:35.759 --> 01:34:38.501]  Some people act out their nightmares.
[01:34:38.521 --> 01:34:41.002]  They get up in the middle of the night and do something violent.
[01:34:41.222 --> 01:34:43.044]  Or, you know, unprovoked.
[01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:44.384]  Yeah, sleepwalking.
[01:34:44.425 --> 01:34:45.405]  Violent sleepwalking.
[01:34:45.525 --> 01:34:45.765]  Yes.
[01:34:46.126 --> 01:34:46.366]  Yes.
[01:34:46.586 --> 01:34:46.866]  Uh-huh.
[01:34:47.286 --> 01:34:48.547]  And that's under sleep disorder.
[01:34:49.128 --> 01:34:55.672]  Then also, in the input to the drugs, these Prozac, Paxil, go off drugs.
[01:34:56.453 --> 01:34:57.894]  It says it can cause delusions.
[01:34:57.914 --> 01:35:01.196]  It can cause abnormal dreams.
[01:35:01.276 --> 01:35:03.017]  And it can cause inner restlessness.
[01:35:04.013 --> 01:35:10.275]  And then, of course, it can cause the discontinuation syndrome, which is actually, of course, withdrawal.
[01:35:10.315 --> 01:35:11.655]  That's their polite word for it.
[01:35:12.495 --> 01:35:28.680]  And agitation, and all kinds of terrible things can happen to people when they get caught up in this cycle of these drugs, and sometimes they can't get off of them, and it's dangerous to get off of them, and so it's just really a national tragedy.
[01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:36.046]  And we have 3,109 cases that have appeared in newspaper articles where it mentions these drugs.
[01:35:36.826 --> 01:35:38.827]  And they've done terrible things.
[01:35:38.908 --> 01:35:55.799]  I mean, when you go into the cover page of SSRI Stories, if you click further and go into the media articles, you'll notice at the very top there's the 48 school shootings or incident school incidences, including, of course, Columbine and Red Lake and University of Northern Illinois and so forth.
[01:35:55.819 --> 01:35:58.000]  Then underneath that, if you scroll down, there's 17 cases
[01:36:00.069 --> 01:36:17.692]  Where a person committed a criminal act while they were on an SSRI antidepressant and these cases were won because the jury actually believed that the SSRI cause or you know was responsible.
[01:36:18.663 --> 01:36:19.743]  Totally or partially.
[01:36:19.964 --> 01:36:24.145]  Yeah, women kill their children, women kill their husbands, husbands kill their children.
[01:36:24.165 --> 01:36:27.506]  There was a case, for example, of a Paula Pinkert in Louisiana.
[01:36:27.526 --> 01:36:30.388]  She shot to death her 11-year-old daughter.
[01:36:30.988 --> 01:36:34.869]  She was a housewife and she loved her daughter dearly and she shot her to death.
[01:36:35.530 --> 01:36:46.814]  And she was given probation because the doctors testified that the Prozac that she was taking caused her to kill her daughter in the sense that, see this is the tricky part, that she was really
[01:36:47.466 --> 01:36:49.287]  A latent bipolar person.
[01:36:49.587 --> 01:36:56.512]  See, they don't want to say that the drug did it, but instead they said, oh, well, she had bipolar disorder, but nobody knew about it.
[01:36:56.632 --> 01:36:57.352]  Yeah, let me break this down.
[01:36:57.372 --> 01:37:07.758]  And the doctor didn't even testify, let me tell you, this is what's important, that she probably never would have killed her daughter if she hadn't taken Prozac because her latent bipolar disorder would never have come forward.
[01:37:08.479 --> 01:37:15.383]  So we have, what are they saying, that we have thousands and millions of people in the country who are running around with some kind of latent
[01:37:16.173 --> 01:37:19.276]  Mental illness, that if they take one of these drugs, they're going to act it out.
[01:37:19.536 --> 01:37:24.400]  Yeah, that's like saying if somebody takes LSD sometimes, they may jump out of a 10-story window.
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:24.880]  Right.
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:28.923]  That they, you know, that they latently had suicidal tendencies.
[01:37:29.003 --> 01:37:31.205]  No, it was the drug whacked them out of their mind.
[01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:32.867]  Now, I'm going to throw out some key points here.
[01:37:33.930 --> 01:37:34.130]  Yeah.
[01:37:34.170 --> 01:37:35.792]  See, the illegal drugs, they can say that.
[01:37:35.852 --> 01:37:38.213]  Yes, the illegal drugs caused them to jump out the window.
[01:37:38.634 --> 01:37:41.115]  But these legal drugs, no, they don't want to say that.
[01:37:41.135 --> 01:37:45.378]  They want to say instead, oh, well that person was suicidal and we just didn't know it.
[01:37:45.478 --> 01:37:46.259]  It was the disease.
[01:37:46.798 --> 01:37:56.085]  Or else they say, oh well that person really had a mental illness like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or obsessive compulsive disorder or something and the drug brought that out.
[01:37:56.546 --> 01:37:57.766]  Well let me break this down.
[01:37:58.287 --> 01:37:59.468]  This is all quackery.
[01:37:59.728 --> 01:38:09.916]  Have you ever seen the video clip from two years ago in the Texas Legislature where the head psychiatrist for the state advisor before the Legislature Board
[01:38:12.875 --> 01:38:20.041]  He is saying that we put 68% of Texas foster children on psychotropics because they have bad gene pools.
[01:38:20.562 --> 01:38:33.093]  Now, even if you believe eugenics, there was no genetic test to say we put 68% of the kids on these drugs because they have bad gene pools or that even those drugs are meant to treat bad gene pools.
[01:38:33.153 --> 01:38:34.894]  It was a total quack
[01:38:35.775 --> 01:39:01.221]  statement as an excuse you know demonizing and and and making subhuman the foster children but expanding on that and I'm sure you know about the new freedom initiative that in 2006 one of the board members in Ohio released the secret federal documents that it was a drug company plan we already knew this but then it was well we got their internal documents to put half they said to go from 20 percent of kids on these drugs to 50 percent by 2013
[01:39:03.061 --> 01:39:08.044]  And they've already gone up a few percentage points, so this is a marketing thing, but it's even better.
[01:39:08.384 --> 01:39:24.975]  It makes them mentally ill, makes them crazy as a you-know-what house rat, and then they get to expand as society goes more and more insane, and as people stab their children to death, murder their neighbors with guns, dress up like Santa Claus, go to a house and burn people down.
[01:39:25.595 --> 01:39:28.496]  You know, dress up in Hitler outfits and go to Columbine and shoot everybody.
[01:39:29.136 --> 01:39:32.317]  As this happens, they then get to take over our lives.
[01:39:32.657 --> 01:39:37.758]  Then the psychologists and psychiatrists start forcing everyone to go through psychological testing.
[01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:41.499]  They then force you to get treatment, force you to say you're mentally ill.
[01:39:41.539 --> 01:39:42.439]  Then you lose rights.
[01:39:42.679 --> 01:39:44.099]  Then more people go on drugs.
[01:39:44.299 --> 01:39:45.320]  Then there's more killing.
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:46.980]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.240]  They are cold-bloodedly at the top.
[01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:50.901]  The low levels don't know this.
[01:39:51.761 --> 01:39:52.721]  Engineering this.
[01:39:52.761 --> 01:39:55.582]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:39:55.602 --> 01:39:56.523]  Can you comment on that?
[01:39:57.083 --> 01:40:08.287]  Well, what I want to say is with the foster children, I believe that they're putting them on antidepressants and anti-psychotics and methamphetamines to control behavior, you know, because the foster parents don't want any...
[01:40:10.179 --> 01:40:12.741]  Now they want zombies that will sit in the cages and not ask for food.
[01:40:12.761 --> 01:40:13.382]  Right.
[01:40:13.522 --> 01:40:19.647]  Because the foster parents only want to take that money and drive the sports car and go to Las Vegas, literally.
[01:40:19.987 --> 01:40:27.013]  The kids literally live in little prison facilities and eat maybe one hot dog or two a day and a bologna sandwich and a glass of water.
[01:40:27.294 --> 01:40:32.098]  And you're right, they give them antipsychotics so they literally drool in the corner.
[01:40:32.118 --> 01:40:33.519]  Right.
[01:40:33.579 --> 01:40:36.742]  The sad thing too about the antidepressants is that
[01:40:37.302 --> 01:40:54.516]  After you go on an antidepressant and go insane, instead of taking you off of the antidepressant very slowly and explaining to you that you need to exercise and have omega-3 oils and take care of yourself and get social support and get out in the sunshine and do some activities instead of, you know, sitting at home worrying.
[01:40:54.536 --> 01:40:54.636]  Yes.
[01:40:55.077 --> 01:41:00.861]  Instead of doing that, no, they tell you that, oh, you need an antipsychotic or you need a mood stabilizer.
[01:41:01.282 --> 01:41:04.124]  So then they make you into a real mental patient.
[01:41:06.151 --> 01:41:18.301]  One of the journal articles we have on SSRI stories in the index is that between 1995 and 2004, there were 4.8 million additional bipolar people diagnosed.
[01:41:19.202 --> 01:41:30.551]  And that was since 2005, so there's probably at least, I would guess, 10 million people now who have been diagnosed as bipolar, probably, and the majority of them started on antidepressants.
[01:41:31.584 --> 01:41:34.786]  And bipolar means you're up and down, which is exactly what the drugs do.
[01:41:35.207 --> 01:41:37.408]  But I have a dog who's up and down.
[01:41:38.549 --> 01:41:42.491]  They say children that are excited and running around the classroom are mentally ill.
[01:41:42.932 --> 01:41:57.181]  All mammal species, baby whales, baby dolphins, baby monkeys, baby apes, baby deer, fawns, colts, baby horses, they all jump and kick and they're supposed to build their muscles.
[01:41:57.501 --> 01:42:00.103]  They're diagnosing normal behavior
[01:42:00.643 --> 01:42:00.804]  Right.
[01:42:00.844 --> 01:42:01.465]  Yes, I agree with that.
[01:42:01.485 --> 01:42:02.066]  And another thing is...
[01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:12.197]  With the children, they do need their recess time, they need plenty of play activity.
[01:42:12.337 --> 01:42:17.479]  Have you heard they're banning recess, running and jumping and dodgeball and skipping is now banned?
[01:42:17.499 --> 01:42:18.239]  Why?
[01:42:19.079 --> 01:42:21.100]  They say it's aggressive and can lead to fights.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:26.342]  And so, hugging, shaking hands, high-fiving or touching is now outlawed.
[01:42:26.542 --> 01:42:27.583]  In fact, people don't believe me.
[01:42:27.623 --> 01:42:30.984]  Google dodgeball ban, tag ban,
[01:42:32.745 --> 01:42:34.125]  Shaking hands ban in schools.
[01:42:34.165 --> 01:42:35.026]  I want people to see that.
[01:42:35.406 --> 01:42:40.549]  CNN, AP, Reuters, on screen, literally training us to be prisoners.
[01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:43.130]  This is a psychological dictatorship.
[01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:48.493]  Have you read the white papers put out by the eugenicists 80 years ago about how they were going to set this up?
[01:42:48.973 --> 01:42:59.999]  Well, no, I haven't really, but I do know that something terrible is happening because they did a study out of Duke University that showed that exercise for a year, in fact, was more
[01:43:01.795 --> 01:43:02.356]  We're good to go.
[01:43:20.925 --> 01:43:21.866]  Ma'am, I gotta stop you.
[01:43:21.886 --> 01:43:23.587]  That's exactly what I was about to bring up next.
[01:43:23.667 --> 01:43:25.168]  It's great to talk to somebody who's informed.
[01:43:25.949 --> 01:43:29.431]  There are older studies in Russia, China, the United States, England, but you're right.
[01:43:29.771 --> 01:43:41.459]  They had one just a few years ago here in Texas done by a major medical center that if somebody will just walk or play golf or start gardening, just getting outside, there's all these studies.
[01:43:41.559 --> 01:43:43.621]  You're meant to do manual labor.
[01:43:43.861 --> 01:43:45.442]  You're meant to walk a few miles.
[01:43:46.462 --> 01:43:49.084]  I mean, for years I got so busy I just quit exercise.
[01:43:50.305 --> 01:43:52.166]  Soil is actually an antidepressant.
[01:43:53.887 --> 01:43:54.428]  Say that again?
[01:43:54.668 --> 01:43:55.488]  Soil, dirt.
[01:43:55.768 --> 01:43:57.490]  Soil is actually an antidepressant.
[01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:59.271]  When you go out to garden, don't wear gloves.
[01:43:59.491 --> 01:44:02.773]  Get your hands in the soil because that's the natural antidepressant.
[01:44:03.113 --> 01:44:03.994]  No, I didn't know that.
[01:44:04.014 --> 01:44:04.314]  Sunshine.
[01:44:04.734 --> 01:44:06.215]  Yes, sunshine is also an antidepressant.
[01:44:06.235 --> 01:44:07.075]  I knew sunshine was.
[01:44:07.096 --> 01:44:12.159]  I knew sunshine through the eyes and the skin, but for those who don't know, there's thousands of studies, scientific fact.
[01:44:12.959 --> 01:44:19.180]  That's why in Scandinavian places where it's dark, they have the real bright walls and artificial sunlight indoors because they have the highest suicide rates.
[01:44:19.461 --> 01:44:20.481]  That's now been reversed.
[01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:25.502]  So yes, the eye stalks, as you know, grow when you're an embryo out of the brain.
[01:44:25.822 --> 01:44:27.362]  So the eyes really are the brain.
[01:44:27.402 --> 01:44:28.963]  It's the gateway to the soul, as they say.
[01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:31.083]  And so they need to have that sunlight.
[01:44:31.103 --> 01:44:38.885]  They're designed to do that for hormone levels inside to trigger the different endocrine levels, to trigger the different endorphins.
[01:44:39.785 --> 01:44:42.487]  For your sex drive, for weight loss, everything.
[01:44:42.768 --> 01:44:46.991]  The key is sunlight, but also the skin does it, not just the vitamin A it produces.
[01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:47.391]  Go ahead.
[01:44:47.811 --> 01:44:52.955]  Yes, also to socially interact with people more, really relieve stress and depression.
[01:44:52.975 --> 01:44:57.399]  As long as you know you're interacting, especially if you're outside, engaging in activities.
[01:44:57.879 --> 01:45:06.447]  Like you mentioned, golf or gardening with somebody or just... Yeah, you're supposed to sit on your front porch and barbecue and laugh and joke about the neighbor and, you know, laugh and joke about yourself.
[01:45:06.788 --> 01:45:09.670]  You're meant to go out and work in the fields all day.
[01:45:09.911 --> 01:45:10.751]  That's when you're happy.
[01:45:10.771 --> 01:45:12.613]  You're not happy watching TV.
[01:45:12.753 --> 01:45:13.013]  Right.
[01:45:13.174 --> 01:45:15.115]  And you're not happy sitting on your butt.
[01:45:15.376 --> 01:45:18.659]  And you're certainly not going to be happy popping Prozac in the fluorine family.
[01:45:19.653 --> 01:45:24.876]  That's true, and also these Omega-3 fatty acids are good for people who are depressed or stressed.
[01:45:24.896 --> 01:45:28.559]  And notice how they say, don't get sun, don't eat fatty acids.
[01:45:29.699 --> 01:45:34.783]  All these things they know are essential for us, they tell us not to have them.
[01:45:36.163 --> 01:45:44.409]  Well, I would have people Google Omega-3 and find out how they can help these people who claim that they are feeling depressed or down.
[01:45:44.429 --> 01:45:47.931]  Of course, everybody has times when they're stressed and depressed in some people's lives.
[01:45:48.462 --> 01:45:48.622]  Okay.
[01:46:02.299 --> 01:46:06.482]  To combat all this sitting around thinking about how terrible things are, you know?
[01:46:06.502 --> 01:46:13.288]  Because depression involves a lot of people thinking in negative, so they have to get out and think positive.
[01:46:13.328 --> 01:46:18.071]  Well, ma'am, I agree with you, but there's also a kind of a wild card in that.
[01:46:18.091 --> 01:46:20.733]  You're not just being negative, but fighting corruption.
[01:46:20.914 --> 01:46:22.094]  Oh, and that's different.
[01:46:22.134 --> 01:46:23.075]  That engages you.
[01:46:23.235 --> 01:46:26.518]  You need to be engaged in something worthwhile and meaningful.
[01:46:27.253 --> 01:46:36.196]  Like you're engaged in this fighting corruption and SSRI stories and engaged in fighting for people who might possibly kill somebody or kill themselves on these drugs.
[01:46:36.397 --> 01:46:37.317]  That helps, too.
[01:46:37.337 --> 01:46:38.877]  That gives you a lot of energy, doesn't it?
[01:46:39.078 --> 01:46:40.158]  Yes, it certainly does.
[01:46:40.478 --> 01:46:42.119]  It's a very deep fount of energy.
[01:46:42.139 --> 01:46:42.499]  Go ahead.
[01:46:42.879 --> 01:46:43.679]  Uh-huh.
[01:46:43.739 --> 01:46:52.923]  So anyway, we were going back again to the index of SSRI stories, and then there were 171 cases as you're scrolling down past all the school shootings.
[01:46:53.503 --> 01:46:55.984]  Then you come to about 58 journal articles.
[01:46:56.638 --> 01:47:05.983]  That will tell you some of the odd things about Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Luvox, and so on, these SSRIs that you don't really know about.
[01:47:06.924 --> 01:47:09.445]  And so there's about 58 journal articles.
[01:47:09.525 --> 01:47:10.786]  I managed to scroll further.
[01:47:10.806 --> 01:47:18.291]  There's 55 highly publicized cases of people who were on these antidepressants and did something very strange.
[01:47:18.551 --> 01:47:23.934]  For instance, OJ Simpson, you know, was on a double dose of Prozac during the time of the murder.
[01:47:25.134 --> 01:47:25.735]  Did you know that?
[01:47:26.417 --> 01:47:26.677]  Yes.
[01:47:27.318 --> 01:47:28.580]  Oh, you did know that, okay.
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:28.760]  Mm-hmm.
[01:47:29.241 --> 01:47:32.465]  Oh, that comedian Phil Hartman's wife, you know, was shot by his wife.
[01:47:32.485 --> 01:47:33.606]  She was on Soloft.
[01:47:33.767 --> 01:47:34.648]  No, they always are.
[01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:36.210]  Oh, yeah.
[01:47:36.610 --> 01:47:38.853]  There's so many of them that it's just, you know, really unbelievable.
[01:47:38.933 --> 01:47:43.179]  I don't think I've ever seen a high-profile mass shooting or one of these where they're not on it.
[01:47:44.246 --> 01:47:45.907]  Well, I mean, very rare.
[01:47:46.207 --> 01:47:48.068]  I can't remember one where it wasn't.
[01:47:48.288 --> 01:47:52.390]  Well, that's why I put the school shootings up at the top of the page, because they are something new.
[01:47:52.410 --> 01:47:56.433]  We really didn't have these school shootings until Prozac was introduced in 1988.
[01:47:56.613 --> 01:48:03.356]  The very first school shooting involved an antidepressant Lori Dan in Chicago, Illinois.
[01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:07.619]  She went into a third grade classroom and shot seven students.
[01:48:07.819 --> 01:48:09.680]  One died and six were seriously injured.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.522]  She was on the antidepressant Nafinil, which is
[01:48:14.161 --> 01:48:31.008]  Similar to an SSRI, even though it's a tricyclic antidepressant, it's much more powerful and it was the first antidepressant to be granted approval for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, OCD, of which a lot of these antidepressants are now the SSRIs.
[01:48:31.568 --> 01:48:36.010]  And she committed that first school shooting in 1989.
[01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:43.813]  And of course she did have some problems too, but here's the thing, if you're having some problems, why exacerbate it by giving you a drug
[01:48:44.557 --> 01:48:47.462]  That causes mania and psychosis and hallucinations.
[01:48:53.226 --> 01:48:54.846]  Here's the next big issue I want to bring up to you.
[01:48:55.167 --> 01:49:02.449]  As I'm sure you know, they're now in all the women's magazines, because I read them in my wife's magazines, going, you're not supposed to have a period.
[01:49:02.849 --> 01:49:03.809]  That's abnormal.
[01:49:03.849 --> 01:49:04.649]  A woman cycles?
[01:49:05.129 --> 01:49:05.610]  Not right.
[01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:09.091]  You need to go on this SSRI for that.
[01:49:10.111 --> 01:49:16.513]  Every time anybody I know in my family or neighbors who has a car wreck and breaks a leg, they come in and push a flu shot and
[01:49:17.776 --> 01:49:20.678]  Putting them on some Prozac drugs for their, quote, depression.
[01:49:20.918 --> 01:49:21.239]  Right.
[01:49:21.579 --> 01:49:29.344]  I mean, they're pushing it on stubbed toes now, and they also mail Prozac free out in samples in the mail.
[01:49:29.404 --> 01:49:30.325]  I'm sure you've seen that.
[01:49:30.745 --> 01:49:31.226]  Yeah.
[01:49:31.386 --> 01:49:33.828]  I mean, these are nothing but LSD pushers.
[01:49:34.608 --> 01:49:35.049]  Right.
[01:49:35.489 --> 01:49:44.756]  There was a terrible case in Dallas of an award-winning school teacher, Lisa Marie Smith, who was on Selexa for PMS, and she
[01:49:45.606 --> 01:49:47.607]  She set her house on fire and murdered her two sons.
[01:49:47.627 --> 01:49:48.508]  She's in prison now.
[01:49:48.528 --> 01:49:49.748]  She tried to kill herself, too.
[01:49:50.089 --> 01:49:51.249]  I mean, this is an example.
[01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:54.171]  There she was, an award-winning school teacher.
[01:49:54.211 --> 01:49:55.031]  Loved children.
[01:49:55.552 --> 01:49:56.372]  Loved teaching.
[01:49:56.732 --> 01:49:57.573]  Loved working with them.
[01:49:59.334 --> 01:50:00.535]  There's so many of these cases.
[01:50:00.575 --> 01:50:03.616]  There's so many in Texas that it's unbelievable.
[01:50:04.337 --> 01:50:09.059]  But there... Well, every time I hear about a woman chopping toddlers' arms off or driving them into the water, they're on it.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.762]  I mean, in every... You know that woman that drowned her kids in Houston?
[01:50:12.782 --> 01:50:13.282]  She was on it.
[01:50:13.544 --> 01:50:14.604]  Yeah, Andrea Yates.
[01:50:14.644 --> 01:50:15.905]  She was on Effexor, yes.
[01:50:16.105 --> 01:50:18.665]  She was on two antidepressants, Effexor and Remeron.
[01:50:19.305 --> 01:50:21.206]  And she became psychotic on them, yes.
[01:50:21.666 --> 01:50:22.706]  It was terrible.
[01:50:23.826 --> 01:50:34.929]  Really... See, the thing about Effexor, too, is in the physician's desk reference now, it says that one of the adverse reactions to Effexor is homicidal ideation.
[01:50:36.850 --> 01:50:39.850]  So, where do you think Andrea Yates received these ideas?
[01:50:40.811 --> 01:50:42.211]  No, it makes you homicidal.
[01:50:42.773 --> 01:50:44.314]  Because it makes you a homicidal guest.
[01:50:44.754 --> 01:50:46.835]  Ideation means homicidal ideas.
[01:50:47.435 --> 01:50:50.136]  But I mean, you can't have ideas, sometimes you act on them, you know?
[01:50:50.576 --> 01:50:53.317]  Listen, look, I've read the police reports.
[01:50:53.898 --> 01:50:56.999]  They'll pull up at a house and a guy's cutting his fingers off and he's on the stuff.
[01:50:57.059 --> 01:50:58.779]  I mean, it's just... Yeah, it is bad.
[01:50:58.799 --> 01:50:59.820]  Stay there, stay there, got a break.
[01:51:01.274 --> 01:51:07.278]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[01:51:07.518 --> 01:51:08.358]  Take a deep breath.
[01:51:09.299 --> 01:51:15.582]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[01:51:15.823 --> 01:51:16.883]  Have a glass of water.
[01:51:17.363 --> 01:51:21.766]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous
[01:51:25.555 --> 01:51:26.235]  I think so.
[01:51:48.029 --> 01:51:48.610]  Thank you.
[01:52:01.092 --> 01:52:02.433]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:52:02.613 --> 01:52:07.595]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[01:52:07.995 --> 01:52:10.076]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[01:52:10.416 --> 01:52:19.480]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:20.441]  We're good to go.
[01:52:44.318 --> 01:52:44.618]  We're good.
[01:53:00.928 --> 01:53:03.109]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.

[01:53:35.227 --> 01:53:39.889]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.

[01:53:56.818 --> 01:53:57.038]  Call today.
[01:54:18.012 --> 01:54:19.413]  Alright, final segment with our guest.
[01:54:19.433 --> 01:54:20.994]  We'll have to have her back up in the near future.
[01:54:21.014 --> 01:54:24.217]  Be sure to visit the website ssristories.com.
[01:54:24.677 --> 01:54:26.118]  And don't think that she has all of them.
[01:54:26.138 --> 01:54:29.161]  There's so many happening continually.
[01:54:29.641 --> 01:54:31.483]  I'll be sure and email those to her so she knows.
[01:54:32.824 --> 01:54:34.925]  They're trying to force-medicate more and more people.
[01:54:35.806 --> 01:54:42.652]  Federal courts have ruled that they can forcibly drug somebody to get them ready for trial.
[01:54:43.332 --> 01:54:45.494]  In the famous case of Dr. Sell up in Missouri,
[01:54:47.268 --> 01:55:00.035]  This really is a revolution by a political guild of witch doctors, International Big Pharma, and their priests, their enforcers, their psychiatrists and psychologists to force everybody onto this.
[01:55:00.575 --> 01:55:05.057]  But I do see that they've overreached and people are really starting to find out about what they're doing.
[01:55:05.818 --> 01:55:12.241]  Yes, they certainly have and even the FDA finally did a little something on March 22nd in 2004.
[01:55:12.321 --> 01:55:13.021]  They put a warning
[01:55:15.029 --> 01:55:17.171]  On the antidepressants, it's up on their website.
[01:55:17.211 --> 01:55:23.576]  You can go to our cover page and scroll down to the bottom of the cover page of SSRI Stories and click on the links.
[01:55:24.357 --> 01:55:28.681]  And at the top link is the FDA's safety warning.
[01:55:29.261 --> 01:55:35.727]  And what it says there is not only that you can have worsening depression and suicidality on these drugs, but let me read this here.
[01:55:35.767 --> 01:55:43.173]  It says that anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability,
[01:55:43.669 --> 01:56:02.424]  Hostility, impulsivity, severe restlessness, hypomania and mania have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications both psychiatric and, get this, non-psychiatric.
[01:56:03.865 --> 01:56:13.333]  And then it says, anytime a decision is made to discontinue treatment, these medications should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly.
[01:56:13.749 --> 01:56:19.273]  So even the FDA did warn about the discontinuation of withdrawal.
[01:56:21.134 --> 01:56:27.678]  And then it says here that antidepressants have the potential for inducing manic episodes in patients with bipolar disorder.
[01:56:28.499 --> 01:56:34.063]  So, I mean, do we know if it's a true bipolar disorder or is this just a phony?
[01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:43.604]  No, it's a perfect business model.
[01:56:43.644 --> 01:56:54.887]  You force people to take a drug that makes them crazy, and then you get to manage them and give them more citations, more names, more diagnoses, until you run their lives.
[01:56:54.927 --> 01:56:56.027]  I mean, this is a criminal game.
[01:56:56.047 --> 01:57:01.669]  Right, they start out kind of stressed, they take an antidepressant, they end up saying the doctor says you're bipolar or whatever.
[01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:11.941]  And the psychiatrist says that and then they give you antipsychotics and mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines and more antidepressants and pretty soon you're on 4, 5, 6 drugs for the rest of your life?
[01:57:12.642 --> 01:57:15.643]  This is what you, you know, you've been diagnosed as mentally ill.
[01:57:16.343 --> 01:57:17.944]  Ma'am, that's absolutely amazing.
[01:57:17.964 --> 01:57:20.665]  You know, we've got a break again for one minute.
[01:57:20.825 --> 01:57:21.305]  Stay there.
[01:57:21.325 --> 01:57:23.025]  I'm going to do five more minutes with you, if that's okay.
[01:57:23.045 --> 01:57:24.606]  Then we're going to have Wayne Madsen on, okay?
[01:57:24.726 --> 01:57:25.466]  Okay, thank you.
[01:57:25.746 --> 01:57:37.950]  Okay, we're going to put her on hold and come back to her because, boy, I've got to have that lady on for two, three hours and take your phone calls with your horror stories because this is so criminal and so obviously ridiculous that if we just speak out against it, it's going to fail.
[01:57:38.530 --> 01:57:40.431]  If not, they're going to try to put everybody on these drugs.
[01:57:41.011 --> 01:57:43.872]  I wanted to tell you about a sponsor, though, before this hour ended.
[01:57:45.193 --> 01:57:46.673]  And that is Ecoloblue.com.
[01:57:46.853 --> 01:57:49.214]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:57:49.694 --> 01:57:58.938]  This is the premier, super high quality, very affordable water purification system that has seven filters, including reverse osmosis.
[01:57:59.418 --> 01:58:00.278]  But here's the kicker.
[01:58:01.359 --> 01:58:02.819]  It grabs it out of the air.
[01:58:03.419 --> 01:58:04.620]  Out of the air you breathe.
[01:58:06.041 --> 01:58:08.424]  and produces seven-and-a-half gallons a day.
[01:58:09.025 --> 01:58:10.787]  Atmospheric water generator for your home.
[01:58:10.827 --> 01:58:13.751]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:58:14.251 --> 01:58:16.835]  It's E-C-O-L-O-BLUE, acolablue.com or 1-800-691-6043.
[01:58:16.875 --> 01:58:18.036]  Give them a call today, folks.
[01:58:23.703 --> 01:58:25.384]  Get off the grid.

[01:58:27.305 --> 01:58:29.927]  Or as I said, acolablue.com.
[01:58:29.987 --> 01:58:37.653]  You can read all about these fine systems and some of the other great products they have at acolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:58:37.913 --> 01:58:40.034]  Final hour, straight ahead, back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:42.636 --> 01:58:44.537]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.138 --> 01:58:48.020]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.069 --> 01:58:52.651]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.771 --> 01:58:57.396]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.496 --> 01:59:00.259]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.479 --> 01:59:03.342]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.522 --> 01:59:08.247]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.447 --> 01:59:09.388]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.588 --> 01:59:12.532]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.832 --> 01:59:19.741]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.821 --> 01:59:22.945]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.105 --> 01:59:24.987]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[01:59:28.231 --> 01:59:34.314]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:59:34.494 --> 01:59:38.236]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.256 --> 01:59:39.576]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:39.616 --> 01:59:40.217]  Take action today.
[01:59:40.237 --> 01:59:42.038]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:55.782]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.262 --> 01:59:59.224]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.590 --> 02:00:16.679]  Matty Henderson, SSRIstories.com.
[02:00:16.699 --> 02:00:19.221]  That's why this radio show is so important.
[02:00:19.241 --> 02:00:21.362]  We bring you all these activists, all these researchers.
[02:00:21.943 --> 02:00:22.723]  I want to just add,
[02:00:23.638 --> 02:00:37.806]  In closing with our guest, before Wayne Madsen comes up, that I have had countless neurologists, brain surgeons, psychologists, psychiatrists, medical doctors on, going back over a decade, breaking all this down.
[02:00:37.846 --> 02:00:40.087]  And we forced it now onto the drug labels.
[02:00:40.407 --> 02:00:41.848]  We forced it into the media.
[02:00:42.448 --> 02:00:43.689]  And now it's common knowledge.
[02:00:43.729 --> 02:00:45.230]  But ten years ago, I'd get laughed at.
[02:00:45.610 --> 02:00:48.692]  Oh yeah, Prozac made the people do the shooting.
[02:00:48.832 --> 02:00:49.792]  Sure they did.
[02:00:50.973 --> 02:00:51.974]  So let's continue.
[02:00:52.918 --> 02:00:55.579]  Because under the New Freedom Initiative, you never really commented on that.
[02:00:56.739 --> 02:00:59.781]  You are aware of the New Freedom Initiative, where they want to put half the kids on drugs?
[02:01:00.201 --> 02:01:11.645]  Well, yes, I am aware, too, and of the Mothers Act, where they want to put mothers who are pregnant and having children and so forth, they want to diagnose them and see if they have, you know, have depression and so forth.
[02:01:12.446 --> 02:01:13.506]  Are you aware of the Mothers Act?
[02:01:14.187 --> 02:01:14.907]  Oh absolutely!
[02:01:16.208 --> 02:01:24.051]  When a woman goes in to have the child, they're already doing it here in Austin, they have a computer on the wall and it's hooked into the health department and they ask, do you have money?
[02:01:25.757 --> 02:01:27.057]  Is your husband nice to you?
[02:01:27.077 --> 02:01:29.018]  Do you have trouble paying your bills?
[02:01:29.058 --> 02:01:30.878]  And then they can say your kid's at risk.
[02:01:31.158 --> 02:01:34.199]  The mother wonders why the CPS is there trying to take the kid.
[02:01:34.239 --> 02:01:38.660]  But also, they then, yes, try to say having a baby is mental illness.
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:39.540]  It's not natural.
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:40.761]  Of course not.
[02:01:41.321 --> 02:01:44.181]  And that we're going to put you on these drugs.
[02:01:44.201 --> 02:01:45.102]  Yeah, tell folks about that.
[02:01:45.602 --> 02:01:54.544]  Well, on SSRI Stories Index, there's 46 cases of postpartum depression where the mother killed herself and usually the baby.
[02:01:55.422 --> 02:01:57.063]  Because she was taking an SSRI.
[02:01:57.784 --> 02:02:06.011]  I mean, they, uh... And so they're trying to say that this was the postpartum depression instead of the drug.
[02:02:06.471 --> 02:02:07.172]  No, no, no.
[02:02:07.272 --> 02:02:08.373]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[02:02:08.433 --> 02:02:10.034]  This is all done on purpose, exactly.
[02:02:11.115 --> 02:02:14.618]  Now, the locals implementing intercompartmentalize, they don't know.
[02:02:15.298 --> 02:02:16.299]  But it's the same.
[02:02:16.519 --> 02:02:17.860]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:02:18.681 --> 02:02:22.304]  It's like when the vaccines kill babies, it came out in court, they knew.
[02:02:22.784 --> 02:02:28.369]  They would just say the mother had shaken the baby when really it was an autoimmune response, that's why they had blood on the brain.
[02:02:28.869 --> 02:02:33.433]  And then they would go ahead and arrest the mom because the hospital killed them with the at-birth vaccine.
[02:02:33.993 --> 02:02:35.174]  It expands from there.
[02:02:35.834 --> 02:02:42.900]  They know the SSRIs are making the mothers kill their kids, so then they say, oh, everybody's got to be on it, that's the problem, go ahead.
[02:02:43.166 --> 02:02:44.887]  Yeah, that's exactly what they say.
[02:02:45.348 --> 02:02:46.028]  You're right there.
[02:02:46.549 --> 02:02:47.389]  It's pure evil, ma'am.
[02:02:47.449 --> 02:02:47.870]  Pure evil.
[02:02:48.150 --> 02:02:49.071]  It's all by design.
[02:02:49.691 --> 02:02:50.812]  But I bet you're a nice person.
[02:02:50.852 --> 02:02:52.553]  I bet you don't think they're doing it by design, do you?
[02:02:53.414 --> 02:02:54.335]  I don't think what?
[02:02:55.476 --> 02:02:56.396]  You're a nice person.
[02:02:56.456 --> 02:02:58.978]  I bet you think the system isn't doing it by design.
[02:02:59.519 --> 02:03:01.480]  Oh, I don't know if they're doing it by design.
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:03.702]  I think they're doing it for a number of reasons.
[02:03:04.002 --> 02:03:07.105]  Well, there's greed, of course, from the pharmaceutical companies nationally.
[02:03:07.485 --> 02:03:10.307]  And then they have all their lobbyists up there in Washington, D.C.
[02:03:10.347 --> 02:03:11.268]  paying people off.
[02:03:11.846 --> 02:03:16.817]  And then, of course, the sales representatives, they influence the doctors and there's advertising on TV.
[02:03:16.838 --> 02:03:20.085]  You can't hardly watch, you know, TV without seeing these ads first.
[02:03:21.487 --> 02:03:32.357]  Yes ma'am, let me give you the document points.
[02:03:32.797 --> 02:03:35.800]  Go to whatistheendgame.com because you're a great researcher.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:38.382]  That's a bibliography for my film, Endgame.
[02:03:38.902 --> 02:03:44.588]  Read those documents, but yes, the United Nations first solicitor general
[02:03:46.022 --> 02:03:49.747]  His full title was Aldous Huxley, Director General UNESCO.
[02:03:50.248 --> 02:03:51.609]  They say this is the plan.
[02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:56.375]  And you can also read Bertrand Russell saying it's the plan, Nobel Prize winner.
[02:03:56.415 --> 02:03:57.076]  So yes, ma'am.
[02:03:57.537 --> 02:04:03.944]  And I know that's shocking, but it's all engineered, it's all by design, it's so cold-blooded, it dwarfs
[02:04:04.997 --> 02:04:07.138]  Just any evil ever committed in history.
[02:04:07.739 --> 02:04:10.540]  And of course, their guild members, their low-level priests don't know.
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.462]  You know, they're filling the priest role.
[02:04:12.482 --> 02:04:14.443]  Like Hitler said, his Gestapo was a priesthood.
[02:04:14.763 --> 02:04:16.824]  And you have the Vatican with the Jesuits, a priesthood.
[02:04:17.104 --> 02:04:20.426]  So a priesthood is a model of kind of an inter-party enforcer.
[02:04:20.887 --> 02:04:25.029]  But that's what they actually call the psychologist and psychologist is their new priesthood.
[02:04:25.649 --> 02:04:32.894]  And they give people the poisons and the death and control, but that is to carry out the overall eugenics.
[02:04:33.749 --> 02:04:34.169]  All right.
[02:04:34.249 --> 02:04:34.709]  I agree.
[02:04:34.830 --> 02:04:38.751]  Of course, the psychiatrist started the eugenics movement.
[02:04:38.791 --> 02:04:40.532]  Hitler loved eugenics.
[02:04:40.872 --> 02:04:41.332]  Yes, ma'am.

[02:06:00.856 --> 02:06:09.543]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[02:06:09.964 --> 02:06:14.667]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[02:06:15.128 --> 02:06:17.690]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[02:06:18.130 --> 02:06:19.751]  Actually results in disease.

[02:06:35.879 --> 02:06:36.840]  Colloidal Gold.
[02:06:37.395 --> 02:06:38.675]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke.
[02:07:08.561 --> 02:07:09.001]  We're good to go!
[02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:35.928]  I think so.
[02:08:01.013 --> 02:08:06.056]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.416 --> 02:08:08.597]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:29.801 --> 02:08:35.785]  Wayne Madsen is an investigative journalist, nationally distributed columnist, and author who has covered Washington, D.C.
[02:08:35.825 --> 02:08:38.967]  politics, national security, and intelligence issues since 1994.
[02:08:39.007 --> 02:08:45.732]  He has written for The Village Voice, The Progressive, CAQ, Counterpunch, The Intelligence Newsletter, based in Paris.
[02:08:46.192 --> 02:08:49.355]  Madsen is the author of Genocide and Covert Operations in Africa.
[02:08:50.235 --> 02:09:00.780]  93 to 99 and co-author of America's Nightmare, The Presidency of George Bush II, and the forthcoming Jaded Task, Big Oil, Black Ops, and Brass Plates.
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:01.701]  That's actually out now.
[02:09:02.141 --> 02:09:05.623]  Madsen is also the author of the Handbook of Personal Data Protection.
[02:09:06.403 --> 02:09:10.025]  Macmillan, an acclaimed reference book on international data protection law.
[02:09:10.065 --> 02:09:11.066]  Madsen is a former U.S.
[02:09:11.086 --> 02:09:16.089]  Naval officer who has assigned to the National Security Agency during the Reagan administration.
[02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:20.912]  He also had 20 years experience in computer security and data privacy.
[02:09:20.932 --> 02:09:30.559]  He has also worked for the Naval Data Automation Command, Department of State, RCA Corporation, and Computer Science Corporation, which now owns DynCorp, I would add.
[02:09:31.479 --> 02:09:35.041]  But going to Wayne Madsen for the 50 minutes we have with you, sir.
[02:09:36.246 --> 02:09:39.808]  I want to get into a host of issues because Wayne doesn't make stuff up.
[02:09:39.828 --> 02:09:44.611]  There's a lot of reporters and a lot of people that are alternative media that mix in this info.
[02:09:45.151 --> 02:09:58.259]  I've heard him say a lot of wild things and things that sound wild and always turns out later to be true and he helped us expose the fact that clearly the DC madam was murdered and he did work with her interviewing her and went to dinner with her shortly before she died.
[02:09:59.924 --> 02:10:01.925]  He's broken just hundreds of major news stories.
[02:10:01.965 --> 02:10:02.766]  It's always great having him.
[02:10:04.127 --> 02:10:04.627]  I was talking to him.
[02:10:04.667 --> 02:10:06.828]  I said, I want to get into Obama's visit to the Middle East.
[02:10:07.268 --> 02:10:08.689]  Is that the capitulation?
[02:10:08.729 --> 02:10:12.952]  The West admitting their setup of the Muslim world, their takeover hasn't worked.
[02:10:13.532 --> 02:10:20.296]  I want to talk about the economy, the banks taking over, admitting they're raising interest rates in reality, using the hoarded money to buy up the system.
[02:10:21.077 --> 02:10:23.038]  I wanted to get into Africa.
[02:10:23.758 --> 02:10:27.200]  North Con, you know, calm here in the U.S.
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:30.622]  AfriCon over there, now dominating, trying to take over.
[02:10:30.862 --> 02:10:36.185]  He wrote a book about that eight, nine years ago, so I want to discuss that today.
[02:10:36.526 --> 02:10:43.770]  A host of issues with him, but the first thing that I want to get into is something he mentioned, kind of the tail end of our little off-air discussion.
[02:10:44.210 --> 02:10:45.251]  David Carradine.
[02:10:46.151 --> 02:10:52.175]  Now, David Carradine's father was in some weird Hollywood secret societies, and there are quite a bit of those, but Alistair Crowley.
[02:10:53.735 --> 02:11:04.855]  Carradine, I know some people that knew him, was into the New World Order, supposedly getting anti-New World Order, was working, and even some of his lawyers and friends said on Larry King, on coming out against secret societies.
[02:11:05.436 --> 02:11:06.117]  That was on CNN!
[02:11:07.185 --> 02:11:08.646]  Not just InfoWars.com.
[02:11:09.567 --> 02:11:15.011]  And clearly there were different stories out of the police and looked like he might have been murdered.
[02:11:15.531 --> 02:11:17.072]  Some family and friends said he was murdered.
[02:11:18.053 --> 02:11:20.735]  The classic MO of being threatened said, okay, he wasn't murdered.
[02:11:21.435 --> 02:11:26.739]  So Wayne Madsen out of the gates has a lot of international connections and always breaks news here.
[02:11:26.799 --> 02:11:28.821]  So Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:11:29.241 --> 02:11:30.542]  Tell us about Carradine first.
[02:11:31.485 --> 02:11:39.227]  Well, Alex, I spent two years ago, I went over to Bangkok to investigate the use of child prostitutes by U.S.
[02:11:40.007 --> 02:11:43.167]  diplomats primarily, but also visiting U.S.
[02:11:43.207 --> 02:11:45.408]  VIPs, including members of Congress.
[02:11:45.988 --> 02:12:00.771]  I got to know a lot of the people who investigate this type of assorted behavior in Bangkok, and what I'm getting is that there is a burgeoning sadomasochism S&M scene in Bangkok.
[02:12:01.451 --> 02:12:28.124]  There's a number of S&M clubs that are attracting a lot of Hollywood types, American, British, and French diplomats, as well as visiting VIPs from other countries, politicians included, and it's a possibility because of people I know who have spoken of the Thai police, that what sometimes happens is that one of these VIPs will be visiting one of these S&M clubs,
[02:12:28.784 --> 02:12:29.365]  I think so.
[02:12:47.002 --> 02:13:01.346]  Whether anyone else was involved in the Carradine situation, which could have been that he died of a heart attack from engaging in what is known in England, of course, is the rough trade.
[02:13:01.806 --> 02:13:09.809]  And so there's a possibility that they're looking to see if his body was removed from one of these S&M clubs.
[02:13:09.869 --> 02:13:14.510]  There's three well-known, Bar-Bar, AZ, and Demonia.
[02:13:15.291 --> 02:13:16.271]  Yeah, amazing.
[02:13:16.291 --> 02:13:19.655]  Expanding on that, one of his ex-wives, but people do make things up.
[02:13:34.463 --> 02:13:40.844]  Until I got older, I didn't realize the penchant that a lot of women have for just making up wild stories, but it seems like more and more of the culture does.
[02:13:40.864 --> 02:13:46.966]  But Carradine, it's from multiple sources, but she said in the divorce, she divorced him because he was doing dangerous sex acts.
[02:13:48.086 --> 02:13:49.506]  Right.
[02:13:49.646 --> 02:13:53.527]  I'm always dubious about taking ex-wives.
[02:13:53.567 --> 02:13:59.368]  They do tend to be somewhat vindictive, but we had two of his ex-wives actually now saying he was into the kind of kinky stuff.
[02:14:00.208 --> 02:14:03.889]  Yeah, and what do they call it where people choke themselves?
[02:14:04.925 --> 02:14:10.047]  Oh yes, one of the theories was autoerotic asphyxiation.
[02:14:11.528 --> 02:14:14.129]  That's kind of a big, big fancy name.
[02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:17.270]  I mean, do you think there's anything to that?
[02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:18.550]  Because that's what they're pretty much saying.
[02:14:18.590 --> 02:14:20.131]  He was in there choked in the closet.
[02:14:20.431 --> 02:14:21.691]  Well, I have to say one thing.
[02:14:21.771 --> 02:14:32.175]  After investigating a couple of strange quote-unquote deaths like in Britain, one of the things that has happened in Britain is
[02:14:34.256 --> 02:14:44.781]  People have been found in, you know, what appears to be autoerotic asphyxiation, but it's a perfect type of situation if you don't want the family asking a lot of questions.
[02:14:45.162 --> 02:14:52.945]  If these people are murdered and it's made to look like this is the situation, the families do not want to go there.
[02:14:53.005 --> 02:14:54.546]  They do not want to... Exactly.
[02:14:54.626 --> 02:14:58.048]  Over and over again, it's done to make it look embarrassing.
[02:14:58.502 --> 02:15:03.544]  And very embarrassing and no questions asked and the families don't want any further investigation.
[02:15:03.884 --> 02:15:06.505]  Case closed, as far as the police are concerned, Ben.
[02:15:08.246 --> 02:15:17.370]  Wayne, in my life experience, all of a sudden I was dating this girl and she suddenly clawed bloody rakes in my back and said, don't you like that?
[02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:19.431]  And I said, is blood running down my back?
[02:15:19.491 --> 02:15:21.032]  I said, no, I'm not into pain.
[02:15:22.182 --> 02:15:34.528]  And so I guess I'm kind of a weirdo because I'm not into pain, but studying the New World Order and studying it throughout history, what is it about elites and people that get into power that they like inflicting pain and receiving pain?
[02:15:36.249 --> 02:15:37.109]  What's going on here?
[02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:39.951]  I mean, because I know you've studied the elite psychology.
[02:15:40.531 --> 02:15:49.175]  Why do I keep reading even in mainstream news that, well, the head of Formula One got in trouble for it, that England is this capital of hardcore S&M?
[02:15:49.456 --> 02:15:50.036]  What is this?
[02:15:50.785 --> 02:15:55.387]  Well, I think it's a power trip for some people.
[02:15:55.447 --> 02:16:08.494]  It's aberrant, it's deviant, but they know they can get away with it because they travel in the circles that allow them to basically do what they want to do without any sort of pressure coming on them.
[02:16:08.614 --> 02:16:16.018]  And I would note that there are members of the British Royal Family that are well known to be into this type of thing.
[02:16:18.722 --> 02:16:20.547]  I think it's the power trip.
[02:16:20.587 --> 02:16:21.890]  Some of it may have to do with...
[02:16:22.856 --> 02:16:29.280]  You know, these various societies that have these weird initiation rituals.
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:32.782]  We certainly know there's quite a few of those.
[02:16:33.182 --> 02:16:41.306]  And, you know, you look at the skull and bones and it's rather a deviant type of initiation ritual that goes on there.
[02:16:41.366 --> 02:16:42.207]  But it's not the only one.
[02:16:42.227 --> 02:16:45.409]  For those that don't know, tell folks what our Christian conservative leaders predominate.
[02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:47.230]  There's also liberals families there.
[02:16:48.511 --> 02:16:49.832]  They're being urinated on.
[02:16:50.433 --> 02:16:52.134]  They're masturbating in coffins.
[02:16:52.174 --> 02:16:53.015]  I mean, that's the M.O.
[02:16:53.035 --> 02:16:54.036]  from pretty credible sources.
[02:16:54.056 --> 02:16:59.202]  Wayne Mattson, from your journalistic reports, what do you know about skull and bones behavior?
[02:16:59.642 --> 02:17:01.043]  Well, basically, it's what you say.
[02:17:01.283 --> 02:17:08.588]  The initiation, you know, there's an event called Tapping, where they'll tap somebody to join.
[02:17:08.648 --> 02:17:26.299]  They go through this initiation ritual, which, you know, entails someone being in a coffin and all this sort of weird exchange of bodily fluids goes on.
[02:17:26.459 --> 02:17:27.279]  And, yeah, I mean,
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:37.804]  I think it goes back to, you know, even more ancient secret societies going back hundreds and hundreds of years.
[02:17:38.064 --> 02:17:50.450]  That's what I was going to say is, you know, you hear about these attorneys where they beat people up or they have sex with animals and it's like, oh this isn't a ritual, the head guy just wears a hood and candles and does this because that's what we do.
[02:17:50.510 --> 02:17:51.891]  Well, why do they do that?
[02:17:52.791 --> 02:18:09.700]  And it's really hidden in plain view that these fraternities, a lot of them, are really kind of the courtyard entryway into real secret societies that, like you said on record, go back thousands of years because intelligence agencies of old were just called secret societies.
[02:18:10.623 --> 02:18:15.224]  Right, and I think a lot of people have been through various initiations.
[02:18:15.584 --> 02:18:28.148]  I was initiated into the Elk Lodge and the American Legion, and that's a ceremony, but I think what separates them from some of these other groups is some of that stuff is just bizarre.
[02:18:30.048 --> 02:18:37.194]  I don't know why anyone would want to be involved in that type of thing, but again, I think it's the fact that they have a good bond with one another.
[02:18:37.554 --> 02:18:41.277]  You know, it's this sort of like wink-wink, nod-nod situation.
[02:18:41.317 --> 02:18:53.307]  I recall in the 2004 campaign, Tim Russert, for all of his faults, he had the guts to ask both Kerry and Bush in interviews about the Stone and Bone.
[02:18:53.367 --> 02:18:55.168]  Of course, he got nothing from either one of them.
[02:18:56.689 --> 02:18:59.330]  But I have to hand it to him for at least asking you.
[02:18:59.370 --> 02:19:01.490]  Not many people tread on that ground.
[02:19:02.890 --> 02:19:04.471]  Now, when we come back, I'll play that clip.
[02:19:04.531 --> 02:19:09.772]  Kerry said, not much because it's a secret, and he says there's a lot of secrets, but I'm not going to talk about it.
[02:19:10.452 --> 02:19:16.733]  I mean, imagine two guys related on every side of their family, not just cousins one way, but it's like a breed of dog.
[02:19:17.694 --> 02:19:19.334]  They're both totally related to each other.
[02:19:20.413 --> 02:19:23.935]  And you got ten people every year initiated into it.
[02:19:24.555 --> 02:19:27.977]  They were at the school during the same four or five years together.
[02:19:27.997 --> 02:19:30.298]  You know, different year classes.
[02:19:30.858 --> 02:19:36.361]  What is the chances of having those two men running against each other for president, Wayne Madsen?
[02:19:37.221 --> 02:19:40.422]  Well, I think it's more than just coincidental.
[02:19:42.603 --> 02:19:46.485]  Yeah, in Skull and Bones, for those that don't know, it is a classic satanic ritual.
[02:19:47.046 --> 02:19:47.646]  The devil
[02:19:48.976 --> 02:19:50.636]  Has you be reborn in a coffin.
[02:19:51.577 --> 02:19:52.997]  Reborn to the host of hell.
[02:19:53.217 --> 02:19:58.178]  It is a worship of piratical enslavement of the general public.
[02:19:59.058 --> 02:20:00.338]  We'll be right back with Wayne Madsen.

[02:20:34.748 --> 02:20:35.548]  What did you say?
[02:20:35.568 --> 02:20:35.648]  928-308-0408.
[02:20:35.668 --> 02:20:36.849]  I didn't get that.
[02:20:36.869 --> 02:20:36.909]  928-308-0408.
[02:20:46.443 --> 02:20:46.903]  3-0-8-0-4-0-8.

[02:20:58.686 --> 02:20:59.806]  That's the idea!
[02:20:59.826 --> 02:21:03.727]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.
[02:21:03.747 --> 02:21:04.267]  800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:21:04.367 --> 02:21:05.867]  And let's take in a brief mind mover.
[02:21:10.131 --> 02:21:15.595]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[02:21:15.795 --> 02:21:21.399]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[02:21:21.599 --> 02:21:23.260]  The stimulus package is working.
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:25.161]  A bailout is coming your way.
[02:21:25.481 --> 02:21:29.404]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[02:21:29.684 --> 02:21:30.064]  Pardon me?
[02:21:30.845 --> 02:21:31.806]  Back to the real world.
[02:21:32.086 --> 02:21:36.048]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:38.310]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[02:21:38.894 --> 02:21:40.355]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[02:21:40.595 --> 02:21:51.364]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[02:21:52.064 --> 02:21:59.130]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[02:22:01.612 --> 02:22:06.876]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.649 --> 02:22:12.994]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:22:13.534 --> 02:22:19.719]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:19.939 --> 02:22:21.841]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:22.001 --> 02:22:24.383]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:24.463 --> 02:22:35.352]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:38.901]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.301 --> 02:22:40.702]  It's about a one world government.
[02:22:41.162 --> 02:22:47.485]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:48.065 --> 02:22:55.869]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.329 --> 02:22:57.470]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:59.091]  The people strike back.
[02:23:02.836 --> 02:23:08.040]  If we could all see the germs that we encounter each day, we might have a different outlook on how we view our surroundings.
[02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:10.842]  In the past, you may not have put too much thought into it.
[02:23:11.222 --> 02:23:14.825]  But with the current health risks in the world today, it's impossible to ignore it.
[02:23:15.225 --> 02:23:17.267]  There is a solution, and it's called Hazrid.
[02:23:17.807 --> 02:23:26.954]  Hazrid utilizes a fogging device that disinfects, sanitizes, and protects against influenza, viruses, bacteria, allergen, mold, and more.
[02:23:27.774 --> 02:23:30.096]  It's tough on germs, but not on children and pets.
[02:23:30.805 --> 02:23:40.290]  You'll receive the fogger, liquid concentrate, enough to make up to 32 gallons of germ-killing power, three respirators, goggles, protective suit, and heavy-duty gloves.
[02:23:40.570 --> 02:23:44.892]  Order right now at hazard.com, and you'll receive double the order of liquid concentrate.
[02:23:45.112 --> 02:23:45.712]  Or call 800-675-0323.
[02:23:45.772 --> 02:23:45.952]  That's 800-675-0323.
[02:23:45.972 --> 02:23:46.873]  Or visit hazard.com.
[02:23:46.893 --> 02:23:47.753]  That's H-A-Z-A-R-I-D.
[02:23:47.773 --> 02:23:48.013]  Protect.
[02:23:48.053 --> 02:23:48.374]  Prepare.
[02:23:48.394 --> 02:23:49.154]  Get your hazard today.
[02:24:07.165 --> 02:24:09.727]  Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive.
[02:24:09.747 --> 02:24:12.109]  He stood six foot six, weighed 245, kind of broad-eyed.
[02:24:14.428 --> 02:24:21.073]  We're going to take your calls in the next segment from Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com, specifically for Wayne Madsen, I would ask, but he can talk about any subject.
[02:24:21.113 --> 02:24:28.038]  He's as knowledgeable as I am, and perhaps more so on many subjects on a broad range of issues, but we always love having him on with us.
[02:24:28.718 --> 02:24:31.740]  WayneMadsenReport.com is a great place to get a lot of key information.
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:36.364]  1-800, the toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:43.629 --> 02:24:44.650]  Going back to Wayne Madsen.
[02:24:44.670 --> 02:24:46.531]  Wayne, there's so much to talk about here.
[02:24:46.551 --> 02:24:47.472]  Let's get into the economy.
[02:24:47.892 --> 02:25:02.502]  AP reported that, oh, banks are hoarding the money and that interest rates have really gone up in reality, though they're at zero supposedly, and that big banks are using the collapse as a way to take over internationally.
[02:25:02.582 --> 02:25:05.223]  So this is really right out in the open.
[02:25:05.243 --> 02:25:08.626]  Give us your take on that and what the rumblings are on in Washington.
[02:25:09.046 --> 02:25:12.748]  If they've already gotten $14.8 trillion in seven months, greater than the GDP,
[02:25:14.250 --> 02:25:16.254]  I mean, is there any amount they won't be given?
[02:25:16.334 --> 02:25:25.451]  Or is this just... Are we going to start calling Fed Chairman Ed Bernanke the first, and then his son will be the prince, and then his son after him, like North Korea or something?
[02:25:26.274 --> 02:25:32.097]  Well, you know, for the first time, Alex, I talk to people who cover the Treasury Department and the Fed.
[02:25:32.637 --> 02:25:41.021]  And, you know, these were not always the most interesting folks to talk to, because, you know, let's face it, the subjects they cover are rather mundane.
[02:25:41.081 --> 02:25:48.105]  But what I've been getting for, I guess, now six to eight months is they don't know what's going on.
[02:25:48.145 --> 02:25:50.126]  They talk to people who work in Treasury.
[02:25:50.186 --> 02:25:51.887]  They talk to people who work at the Fed.
[02:25:52.487 --> 02:25:54.689]  And they say, where's this all heading?
[02:25:54.749 --> 02:25:56.671]  And they get these, you know, people shaking their head.
[02:25:57.892 --> 02:25:58.713]  You know, we don't know.
[02:25:58.733 --> 02:26:00.555]  They're throwing up their arms.
[02:26:01.736 --> 02:26:11.625]  And I think this whole idea that we're in this uncharted territory and nobody knows what's going on is, I think, the most worrisome thing.
[02:26:12.512 --> 02:26:19.796]  Well, you know, this kind of high-level economics was something only a few people could understand.
[02:26:19.836 --> 02:26:24.019]  Now the fact is, it doesn't seem like anyone understands it.
[02:26:24.139 --> 02:26:25.019]  Well, here's the M.O.
[02:26:25.139 --> 02:26:29.562]  I get from Joseph Stiglitz, as you know, Nobel Prize winner, former World Bank Chief Economist.
[02:26:30.082 --> 02:26:35.005]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Wall Street Journal editor and assistant head of Treasury.
[02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:47.723]  They know what they're doing and whether they engineered it or whether it's out of their control, they've decided to capitalize from the collapse of society and I believe they engineered it and the evidence shows that.
[02:26:48.543 --> 02:26:51.484]  And so they don't want to tell people where it's going and what's going to happen.
[02:26:51.504 --> 02:26:58.346]  It's just false hope because they know it means total collapse so they can consolidate and that's why the banks are hoarding all their money.
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:06.744]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, a few weeks back I was at the, for the first time I was at this White House Correspondent Center and Geithner was there.
[02:27:06.944 --> 02:27:14.628]  And a friend of mine asked Geithner, he said, listen, if you keep printing up money, aren't you worried about hyperinflation?
[02:27:15.048 --> 02:27:23.392]  And Geithner just let loose with a net, you know, this expletive deleted, and said it's not blank gonna happen, it's not blank gonna happen.
[02:27:23.872 --> 02:27:30.394]  I mean, you get the impression that the people that are running the show are incompetent.
[02:27:30.894 --> 02:27:42.337]  It may be that they're cleverly incompetent because the massive rip-off is taking place, but we know what happens to countries where they just print money without any other consideration.
[02:27:42.677 --> 02:27:44.217]  Certainly that's what happened in Germany.
[02:27:46.818 --> 02:27:49.440]  It's like a Mexican standoff where everybody's aiming at everybody.
[02:27:49.801 --> 02:27:51.882]  China is totally invested with us.
[02:27:51.962 --> 02:27:53.724]  They know they're buying total crud.
[02:27:54.364 --> 02:27:56.666]  But we're also where they export all their goods.
[02:27:57.607 --> 02:28:00.490]  And so it looks like the United States can just print, print, print.
[02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:02.932]  But that's still going to hyperinflate things here.
[02:28:03.412 --> 02:28:07.275]  And then they're hyperinflating money that we're supposed to pay back as taxpayers.
[02:28:07.736 --> 02:28:10.878]  Anyway you cut it, this is going down a very dark road.
[02:28:10.918 --> 02:28:12.840]  How do you see it unfolding, Wayne Madsen?
[02:28:13.328 --> 02:28:15.752]  Well, I'll tell you where I see it unfolding.
[02:28:15.992 --> 02:28:22.142]  I think we have to look at what just recently happened in Europe with these European Union elections for the European Parliament.
[02:28:22.582 --> 02:28:28.512]  You know, a lot of the well-established parties just really took it in the short.
[02:28:29.344 --> 02:28:38.372]  The British Labour Party in some constituencies finished behind, of course, the British National Front, which is the far-right, you know, fascist party.
[02:28:38.952 --> 02:28:45.177]  They even, in some parts of England, they fell behind the Cornwall Nationalist Party.
[02:28:45.598 --> 02:28:49.421]  In Sweden, a group called the Pirate Party won their first seat.
[02:28:49.741 --> 02:28:53.304]  They're, you know, they're basically, they want all software free, they want to download
[02:28:53.964 --> 02:28:56.126]  I don't know.
[02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:13.598]  Because what happened in Europe may happen here now.
[02:29:14.199 --> 02:29:21.649]  Will that be such a bad thing if people start to put third parties, fourth parties, maybe even fifth parties into office?
[02:29:21.769 --> 02:29:24.393]  Maybe not, but it may take something like that to shake them up.
[02:29:24.910 --> 02:29:25.630]  Excellent answer.
[02:29:25.650 --> 02:29:27.451]  That's exactly what I am saying.
[02:29:27.811 --> 02:29:30.212]  We have these headlines about right-wing takes over Europe.
[02:29:30.652 --> 02:29:31.512]  It's not right-wing.
[02:29:31.552 --> 02:29:36.674]  People voted for anything but the establishment parties, but the media is making it a left-right issue.
[02:29:37.074 --> 02:29:39.235]  Obama is the establishment's last hurrah.
[02:29:39.575 --> 02:29:48.398]  If he can't bring the American people and the people of the world back to the table to be raped by the bankers some more, they know they're going to have a real political revolution.
[02:29:48.658 --> 02:29:50.459]  We'll be back with Wayne Madsen to talk about that.
[02:29:51.259 --> 02:29:52.239]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.659 --> 02:29:54.160]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.171 --> 02:29:57.934]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.838 --> 02:30:06.384]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[02:30:06.705 --> 02:30:07.846]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:30:07.986 --> 02:30:11.891]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[02:30:12.253 --> 02:30:13.814]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:30:14.114 --> 02:30:20.419]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:24.122]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.

[02:30:26.183 --> 02:30:28.965]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:30:29.185 --> 02:30:30.646]  And their formula really works.
[02:30:30.907 --> 02:30:33.448]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:30:33.709 --> 02:30:39.593]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[02:30:39.952 --> 02:30:42.154]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:30:42.374 --> 02:30:43.375]  And take it from me, folks.
[02:30:43.595 --> 02:30:44.636]  It really does taste great.
[02:30:44.836 --> 02:30:46.597]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[02:31:06.118 --> 02:31:09.919]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:10.159 --> 02:31:15.762]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:16.062 --> 02:31:20.903]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.124 --> 02:31:25.145]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.225 --> 02:31:26.025]  We're good to go!

[02:32:01.102 --> 02:32:07.285]  ...that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:32:07.525 --> 02:32:11.807]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[02:33:27.646 --> 02:33:32.047]  Someone who cares.
[02:33:32.087 --> 02:33:37.009]  Your own personal Jesus.
[02:33:40.346 --> 02:33:42.769]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:45.913]  Someone who's there.
[02:33:47.095 --> 02:33:53.383]  All right, we are talking to Wayne Madsen.
[02:33:53.403 --> 02:33:57.267]  We're gonna go back to him in just a moment and some of your
[02:33:59.281 --> 02:34:01.102]  Phone calls as well.
[02:34:02.202 --> 02:34:06.684]  Lewis in Texas, Patty in New York, Katrina in Colorado, and others.
[02:34:06.704 --> 02:34:11.306]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:34:11.786 --> 02:34:16.668]  First, though, one of them is New Silver Solution, and I really believe in this.
[02:34:16.708 --> 02:34:17.968]  We use this in my household.
[02:34:18.429 --> 02:34:24.611]  We've used colloidal silver for a long time, but they've really, as it's gotten more popular, developed even better types of it.
[02:34:25.031 --> 02:34:26.752]  And this is nanoparticulate.
[02:34:27.512 --> 02:34:28.894]  And that's what makes silver so powerful.
[02:34:28.954 --> 02:34:31.016]  It's so small, it destroys viruses and bacteria.
[02:34:31.036 --> 02:34:32.658]  It goes right through their cell walls.
[02:34:32.698 --> 02:34:34.039]  It was the old-fashioned antibiotic.
[02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:39.585]  And now that all the modern ones aren't working too well or aren't working at all, it's making a big comeback.
[02:34:39.705 --> 02:34:42.628]  And a great brand is SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:34:43.971 --> 02:34:47.332]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:34:47.352 --> 02:34:48.652]  You've been down to the third world?
[02:34:49.232 --> 02:34:51.433]  Take a few swigs of this to knock those parasites out.
[02:34:51.453 --> 02:34:53.513]  You got a cold and it's bacterial?
[02:34:54.213 --> 02:34:54.914]  This stuff's great.
[02:34:55.294 --> 02:34:59.815]  Or you can use a neti pot if you've got a bacterial or viral infection up in your sinus.
[02:35:00.675 --> 02:35:03.556]  I've had medical doctors on who have recommended this on air.
[02:35:03.876 --> 02:35:05.756]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:35:06.216 --> 02:35:07.557]  SupernaturalSilver.com.

[02:35:13.481 --> 02:35:19.665]  I really do believe in this product and this is one of the best technologies out there with the basic silver technology.
[02:35:20.005 --> 02:35:22.067]  Another sponsor is eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:35:22.087 --> 02:35:24.508]  This is the name in storable foods.
[02:35:24.528 --> 02:35:25.989]  28 years now in operation.
[02:35:26.849 --> 02:35:28.591]  This is where I chose to get my storable foods.
[02:35:29.011 --> 02:35:30.692]  Last more than 10 years in climate control.
[02:35:32.714 --> 02:35:35.637]  Ten years if it's out in the heat in your garage or attic.
[02:35:36.237 --> 02:35:38.359]  High quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid.

[02:35:45.165 --> 02:35:47.788]  Don't be completely dependent on the man as we go into this depression.
[02:35:48.789 --> 02:35:51.431]  I hope you don't have to use the food, but there's a good chance you will.

[02:36:00.368 --> 02:36:04.325]  And don't forget I gotta put one plug in a day that we have an online video and uh...
[02:36:05.484 --> 02:36:05.964]  Bookstore.
[02:36:06.185 --> 02:36:08.866]  It's a bookstore and video store online at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:08.906 --> 02:36:13.449]  It takes a lot of money to run the websites, the news sites, the websites, and all the work we do here.
[02:36:14.490 --> 02:36:23.936]  PrisonPlanet.tv members get to see the live TV show, version of the radio show, and all my films in high quality in my book, and Paul Watson's book, and all the other things we're adding, and Burma's Live 9 to Midnight.
[02:36:24.496 --> 02:36:31.801]  That's all available at PrisonPlanet.tv for 15 cents a day as well, or order high-quality DVDs, books, t-shirts,
[02:36:32.381 --> 02:36:33.561]  It's all about spreading the word.

[02:36:38.162 --> 02:36:44.504]  And don't forget to support our guests who are doing great work like Wayne Madsen with WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:36:44.524 --> 02:36:45.624]  Be sure and check that site out.
[02:36:45.924 --> 02:36:48.785]  Okay, Wayne, I want to throw out a few quick questions to you and then get to calls.
[02:36:50.005 --> 02:36:51.045]  I've been throwing questions out.
[02:36:51.205 --> 02:36:53.706]  My question is, what do you think is most important right now?
[02:36:54.746 --> 02:36:57.827]  I want to get some into Obama, but where do you see
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:02.542]  Coming up on the horizon, what do you see happening in Pakistan, Afghanistan?
[02:37:02.882 --> 02:37:04.462]  What do you see happening domestically?
[02:37:04.503 --> 02:37:06.684]  What do you see happening with staged terror?
[02:37:07.464 --> 02:37:08.945]  Or any other points you think are important?
[02:37:09.905 --> 02:37:13.267]  Well, I'll tell you on the Pakistan, Afghanistan...
[02:37:15.718 --> 02:37:28.082]  It just isn't helping our cause much that we are using these remotely piloted drones to fire these missiles at wedding parties, into people's homes.
[02:37:28.142 --> 02:37:34.464]  There are constantly demonstrations in Afghanistan and also in Pakistan every time civilians are killed.
[02:37:35.804 --> 02:37:37.265]  So, you know, Obama could give
[02:37:38.246 --> 02:37:51.961]  50 Cairo speeches, and in those particular areas of the Muslim world, it's going to have very little effect, because they say, oh yeah, well I heard this speech, this outreach, but the missiles are still falling, they're still
[02:37:53.618 --> 02:38:11.952]  killing innocent civilians and uh... i think uh... the problem now obama had that he's got a lot of retreads from the clinton administration richard holbrooke with the architect he would be architect of uh... this uh... devastating war in serbia uh... yeah now we've got how many countries that compose the former yugoslavia about eight
[02:38:13.052 --> 02:38:19.994]  I mean, so, and you know, some of them are fighting each other and there's even indications there could be more fracturing.
[02:38:20.054 --> 02:38:21.255]  But isn't that the plan?
[02:38:21.335 --> 02:38:28.957]  Balkanize Pakistan, Balkanize Iraq, Balkanize Syria, Balkanize Saudi Arabia, Balkanize Serbia.
[02:38:29.357 --> 02:38:34.299]  Any sovereign nation can't be allowed to build up outside this global corporate state.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:44.605]  Well, I think you've got a good point there, because what we saw after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was this Balkanization.
[02:38:45.065 --> 02:38:53.449]  If Pakistan should be Balkanized, we're talking about five or six different countries arising out of a former Pakistan.
[02:38:53.849 --> 02:38:56.651]  But only one, the Punjabi region, having the bomb.
[02:38:56.711 --> 02:39:01.234]  So it would be not the Pakistani nuclear weapon, it would be the Punjabi nuclear weapon.
[02:39:01.674 --> 02:39:09.860]  And that's just a recipe for a disaster when you're dealing with a neighboring country, India, which also has a lot of restive regions.
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:15.804]  And there's going to be constant wars between those five parts until some warlord unifies it.
[02:39:16.124 --> 02:39:20.627]  Perfect for the globalists to have some new region to always pump their weapon systems into.
[02:39:21.528 --> 02:39:28.933]  Absolutely, and you know, and Holbrooke of course is the super envoy of Hillary Clinton now over to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[02:39:29.594 --> 02:39:43.023]  He's also taking charge, maybe a good thing he has taken charge of Iran, the Iran situation from Dennis Ross, who is very much in bed with Likud, and they want to bomb, of course, the back of the Stone Age.
[02:39:43.064 --> 02:39:47.387]  So in the case of Iran, Holbrooke is actually the moderate, believe it or not.
[02:39:48.347 --> 02:40:10.435]  But it's still these people, all these Council on Foreign Relations, this AIPAC crowd, America-Israel Public Affairs Committee, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, all these various think tanks that basically are conducting, US foreign policy is being conducted basically
[02:40:10.435 --> 02:40:28.038]  Basically, as a franchise to special interest groups, and I think that's one of the things that Obama is going to have to face here with him getting tough recently on Israeli settlements and Israel's policy against Iran.
[02:40:28.478 --> 02:40:39.780]  He told them he doesn't want them to attack Iran and he wants them to halt the settlements, but Netanyahu is saying flat out no, and it's resulting in probably the worst U.S.-Israeli relationship
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:44.164]  You think that's a real break because Obama was financed in large part by the Israeli lobby?
[02:40:54.976 --> 02:41:08.488]  You know, and I look at Rahm Emanuel as Chief of Staff and others, and I have to wonder how far can he go with having these... I mean, Emanuel during Desert Storm was serving in the Israeli Army.
[02:41:08.508 --> 02:41:20.900]  I mean, when all of our guys, men and women, were fighting over in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and in Iraq, here we have Emanuel serving in another country's armed forces.
[02:41:21.580 --> 02:41:23.441]  How much leeway does Obama have?
[02:41:23.461 --> 02:41:33.643]  I wish I had my ear inside the West Wing, but I do know that Emmanuel is probably one of the strongest Chiefs of Staff in recent memory.
[02:41:33.663 --> 02:41:39.845]  In one case, he was cracking his knuckles at this Cabinet meeting.
[02:41:40.345 --> 02:41:42.806]  Obama said, Rom, I find that annoying.
[02:41:42.866 --> 02:41:43.507]  I wish it stopped.
[02:41:43.527 --> 02:41:47.268]  He gets up and cracks his knuckles right in Obama's ear, and everybody laughs.
[02:41:47.328 --> 02:41:53.111]  And I think that was Emanuel's way to tell the visiting members of Congress and members of the Cabinet, hey, I'm in charge here.
[02:41:53.931 --> 02:41:57.373]  Wayne, I have to say that everything with Obama is betrayal.
[02:41:57.873 --> 02:42:06.337]  He'll say he's going to do the right thing, and then he always goes back on it later, or puts it into some debate process while continuing with the older bad policy.
[02:42:07.583 --> 02:42:16.910]  So I think there's going to be a staged terror attack, or something's going to happen so Obama can say, well, see, I tried to fix things, but now I've got to go in there.
[02:42:17.690 --> 02:42:26.316]  There's no way that the IDF Mossad agent, Emanuel, and all that money he got from Israel, there's no way they're not going to continue.
[02:42:26.336 --> 02:42:29.519]  But side issue, what are you hearing in Washington?
[02:42:29.539 --> 02:42:33.982]  Because I know you're right inside those intelligence meetings, covering them for the press.
[02:42:35.484 --> 02:42:38.471]  The word is that Israel may go it alone and attack Iran.
[02:42:38.892 --> 02:42:40.375]  Would they do that without U.S.
[02:42:40.415 --> 02:42:40.756]  backing?
[02:42:42.250 --> 02:42:42.770]  Where do you see it?
[02:42:43.150 --> 02:42:45.632]  Well, I don't think they logistically could.
[02:42:45.692 --> 02:42:57.137]  They'd have to fly over first Jordanian airspace, but then they'd have to go over Iraqi airspace, and we control Iraqi airspace, so it would have to be done with our connivance.
[02:42:57.177 --> 02:43:00.359]  Otherwise, they'd have to fly over Saudi airspace.
[02:43:00.399 --> 02:43:08.263]  Now, they could potentially get that permission, because one of the little known things about the Middle East is that the Saudis hate the Iranians.
[02:43:09.107 --> 02:43:25.200]  Yeah, they're literally on the same page when it comes to the Iranians, and there has been a lot of low-level intelligence cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Israel on Iran, and also with the situation with Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:30.285]  It's very little known, but it has been going on for a number of years.
[02:43:32.767 --> 02:43:34.209]  Certainly they may like to.
[02:43:34.509 --> 02:43:48.604]  The only way they could actually avoid the airspace and hit Iran would be to use their submarines, Israeli submarines, and they have at least one, if not two, in the Persian Gulf at any given time with nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.
[02:43:48.624 --> 02:43:50.506]  That's right, those German dolphins.
[02:43:52.188 --> 02:44:00.352]  That's right, but they can only pack a certain amount of punch with those because, you know, they're constrained to submarine platforms.
[02:44:01.392 --> 02:44:07.455]  So, you know, would they basically reap more than they would sow in a situation like that?
[02:44:07.595 --> 02:44:12.217]  Well, you know, Iran could be expected to really retaliate and enforce.
[02:44:12.237 --> 02:44:14.398]  But we have Iranian presidential elections coming up.
[02:44:14.878 --> 02:44:25.888]  This week, and if the moderate wins, that's going to take a lot of the wind out of the sails of Netanyahu to be talking about a strike on Iran, because everybody will be looking at sort of the rapprochement.
[02:44:25.969 --> 02:44:32.755]  And if Musavi wins that election, I think we'll have an Iranian embassy reopening in Washington in probably six months.
[02:44:33.689 --> 02:44:37.873]  Okay, I want to go to some calls here as promised, but Wayne, I want to throw out two other points to you.
[02:44:37.913 --> 02:44:39.815]  I know you've got some intel on Air France.
[02:44:40.596 --> 02:44:42.018]  Was there any chicanery there?
[02:44:42.058 --> 02:44:43.399]  A lot of people have been saying that.
[02:44:43.419 --> 02:44:45.301]  There have been bomb threats in the days before.
[02:44:45.321 --> 02:44:48.124]  I want to get your take on that from your sources, but first...
[02:44:49.858 --> 02:45:04.649]  We remember that the CIA section chief over Afghanistan and Pakistan, and we interviewed him, wrote Jawbreaker, and admitted what we already knew, that the Taliban would grab for $20,000, $25,000 bounties, 14-year-old kids that couldn't find the U.S.
[02:45:04.709 --> 02:45:11.475]  on a map, sell them as Al-Qaeda fighters, and then they would take them to Guantanamo Bay, and the government didn't care.
[02:45:11.515 --> 02:45:16.478]  They wanted just bodies to say, look, there's the terror threat, you know, to add validity to the war on terror.
[02:45:17.619 --> 02:45:41.348]  Now, it's admitted that in Pakistan and Iraq, they pay people $150 per RFID chip, or it's more than RFID, little radio beacons, and that the people admit, this was in the Times of London and London Telegraph and in Wired Magazine, that they then just go throw them in innocent people's houses.
[02:45:42.368 --> 02:45:45.189]  And that's some of why we see weddings and people being wiped out.
[02:45:45.629 --> 02:45:48.310]  People just leave these in public places and get their $150.
[02:45:49.010 --> 02:45:56.213]  And the Defense Department doesn't care because they just want to say, oh look, we identified all these terror targets to keep the mission going.
[02:45:56.273 --> 02:45:57.833]  It's kind of like fake body counts.
[02:45:58.094 --> 02:46:02.055]  Instead of having fake body counts, we'll just go ahead and blow up real weddings.
[02:46:02.275 --> 02:46:07.017]  And they're now using dead people at weddings as a body count and have reintroduced the body count.
[02:46:07.057 --> 02:46:07.777]  Your comments on that?
[02:46:08.433 --> 02:46:13.737]  Well, it harkens back to what happened in Vietnam with Operation Phoenix.
[02:46:13.778 --> 02:46:18.722]  It inflated the number of Viet Cong and VA dead.
[02:46:18.742 --> 02:46:21.884]  They're playing with numbers.
[02:46:22.205 --> 02:46:24.486]  I really think we need to get out of Iraq.
[02:46:24.506 --> 02:46:26.108]  We need to get out of Afghanistan.
[02:46:26.848 --> 02:46:29.569]  And, you know, stop this bloodletting on both sides.
[02:46:30.209 --> 02:46:46.372]  You know, General Petraeus, who I think is the biggest fraud ever, you know, served recently in the Pentagon, wearing a uniform, is basically still pushing a surge, and now he wants the surge in Afghanistan, and the surge has had dramatic consequences.
[02:46:46.712 --> 02:46:52.254]  We've had all these, you know, the media doesn't even cover Baghdad anymore, or Iraq more generally.
[02:46:52.294 --> 02:46:54.214]  That's right, the deaths have gone back up now.
[02:46:54.574 --> 02:47:02.039]  Exactly, and you know, three servicemen here killed in a roadside bomb, four here, and nobody's even covered it.
[02:47:02.079 --> 02:47:03.080]  You don't even get covered.
[02:47:03.100 --> 02:47:04.541]  Because Obama's in now!
[02:47:04.641 --> 02:47:06.682]  Now it's a new chapter, move on!
[02:47:07.382 --> 02:47:09.364]  And then it's almost like Iraq doesn't exist!
[02:47:09.924 --> 02:47:10.425]  That's the war.
[02:47:10.745 --> 02:47:11.486]  That's the other thing.
[02:47:11.526 --> 02:47:16.032]  This progressive organization now is supporting Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:47:16.092 --> 02:47:17.093]  This is a surge.
[02:47:17.594 --> 02:47:19.937]  They've just shown themselves to be total phonies.
[02:47:20.257 --> 02:47:21.178]  They're not progressive.
[02:47:21.218 --> 02:47:23.541]  They were just in it for themselves.
[02:47:23.862 --> 02:47:26.024]  Another George Soros-backed organization.
[02:47:27.566 --> 02:47:32.749]  You know, chief and most wealthy troublemaker in the world today.
[02:47:33.029 --> 02:47:33.970]  What about Soros?
[02:47:34.010 --> 02:47:36.011]  He's had all his organs attacking me lately.
[02:47:36.051 --> 02:47:36.832]  It's kind of scary.
[02:47:37.272 --> 02:47:38.112]  All his publications.
[02:47:38.133 --> 02:47:38.753]  I join the club.
[02:47:38.793 --> 02:47:39.413]  Me too.
[02:47:39.673 --> 02:47:43.936]  He's after me every day and it comes from different, you know, he has all these fun organizations.
[02:47:43.976 --> 02:47:46.357]  So I'm getting it from, you know, multiple sides.
[02:47:46.638 --> 02:47:48.579]  What does that mean to have Soros attacking us?
[02:47:49.409 --> 02:47:50.870]  I think it's good.
[02:47:50.990 --> 02:48:00.573]  It shows that we're not buying into his Hegelian view of the world, where he tries to create these opposition forces, and he's going to capitalize on the chaos he creates.
[02:48:00.613 --> 02:48:10.557]  He puts these puppets in, he has these themed revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine, he calls them Orange Revolutions, Tulip Reservoir Revolutions, and whatnot.
[02:48:10.717 --> 02:48:28.723]  And that's my point, is why is he bragging at press conferences that he's behind the crisis, which he really isn't, but he's capitalizing, and saying I'm having a great crisis time of my life, culmination of my life, and then he's funding these eugenics movies saying carbon footprints are big, we gotta have global taxes paid to him.
[02:48:30.151 --> 02:48:35.894]  He's just a masterful... I look at him as a foreigner.
[02:48:35.955 --> 02:48:42.599]  He's the same as Rupert Murdoch, only, you know, he's more insidious how he infiltrates the media, where Murdoch doesn't care.
[02:48:42.639 --> 02:48:44.820]  He just goes and buys newspapers.
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:49.583]  Whereas Soros basically infiltrates or sets up his own fun organization.
[02:48:49.603 --> 02:48:59.449]  You know, Soros runs the old Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty now and puts out all this propaganda that's aimed primarily at Russia, but at other countries as well, where he's up to no good.
[02:48:59.909 --> 02:49:00.570]  Are you kidding?
[02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:05.159]  He's producing, his front groups are producing many films about me now.
[02:49:05.599 --> 02:49:08.665]  And I mean, I know this guy sends hit teams into countries too.
[02:49:08.725 --> 02:49:11.971]  It's kind of creepy, Wayne, but you don't think he'll come after us physically?
[02:49:13.054 --> 02:49:27.379]  Well, I hope not, but look, he's a guy that's a multi-billionaire, so he can do whatever his money can buy, but the good thing is there's a pushback against Soros, and the Republic of Georgia is now an anti-Soros political party.
[02:49:27.739 --> 02:49:35.021]  They called him out in Moldova, he tried to stage a revolution there called the Twitter Revolution, it failed, and Ukraine are after him.
[02:49:35.061 --> 02:49:40.303]  So I see that there's basically this reaction against Soros,
[02:49:40.643 --> 02:49:45.326]  And the more we expose them, the more the reaction will become stronger against morale.
[02:49:45.346 --> 02:49:51.930]  We're going to come back and cram in a few final calls for you, but real quick, tell us about Air France that disappeared.
[02:49:52.991 --> 02:50:06.779]  I was told by people with links to three intelligence services, British, French, and American, that look at the passenger list, there were two individuals who were getting ready to unveil this year's survey on small arms in Geneva.
[02:50:07.059 --> 02:50:09.601]  They've been battling drug and weapons.
[02:50:10.021 --> 02:50:11.102]  We're good to go.
[02:50:22.421 --> 02:50:27.962]  Well, I mean, they're talking about weird electronic interference already, and how would this super-modern plane just disappear?
[02:50:28.742 --> 02:50:29.903]  Who was it they were trying to kill?
[02:50:30.483 --> 02:50:41.945]  Well, the two individuals were Ronald Dreyer, a Swiss diplomat, and Pablo Dreyfus, who had worked with the Brazilian government to combat drug gangs and weapons and drug smuggling.
[02:50:42.185 --> 02:50:44.886]  There was also a former Brazilian royal on board.
[02:50:45.586 --> 02:50:46.366]  That's true, too.
[02:50:46.426 --> 02:50:50.727]  Well, he may have been collateral damage, along with a couple other senior corporate executives.
[02:50:52.034 --> 02:50:52.275]  Yeah.
[02:50:52.896 --> 02:50:53.236]  Interesting.
[02:50:53.276 --> 02:50:54.138]  Wayne Madsen, stay there.
[02:50:54.198 --> 02:50:55.340]  Jamming a few final calls.
[02:50:55.441 --> 02:50:57.284]  The Wild Cards on the other side.
[02:50:57.885 --> 02:50:58.346]  Stay with us.
[02:50:58.386 --> 02:50:59.568]  Transmission nearing completion.
[02:51:01.385 --> 02:51:04.747]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:51:04.907 --> 02:51:10.110]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:51:10.290 --> 02:51:15.073]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:51:15.253 --> 02:51:26.220]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:32.064]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[02:51:32.264 --> 02:51:38.328]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:51:38.488 --> 02:51:39.128]  What about you?
[02:51:39.348 --> 02:51:41.249]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[02:51:41.269 --> 02:51:43.931]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[02:51:45.552 --> 02:51:47.814]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[02:51:47.894 --> 02:51:48.154]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[02:51:48.194 --> 02:51:49.776]  Or order online by visiting us at Directive21.com.
[02:51:49.796 --> 02:51:51.377]  That's Directive, the number 21 dot com now.
[02:51:51.397 --> 02:51:52.598]  In the new world orders war against humanity.
[02:52:04.747 --> 02:52:06.849]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:14.357]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:14.958 --> 02:52:21.105]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.525 --> 02:52:23.367]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.507 --> 02:52:25.929]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.009 --> 02:52:36.978]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.578 --> 02:52:38.879]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.259 --> 02:52:40.641]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.121 --> 02:52:47.346]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:48.010 --> 02:52:55.794]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:56.274 --> 02:52:57.415]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:57.855 --> 02:52:59.116]  The people strike back.
[02:53:00.977 --> 02:53:01.857]  Ah, springtime.
[02:53:02.277 --> 02:53:07.440]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[02:53:07.790 --> 02:53:12.254]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[02:53:12.395 --> 02:53:18.140]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[02:53:18.381 --> 02:53:26.669]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[02:53:26.989 --> 02:53:29.672]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[02:53:29.972 --> 02:53:36.177]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons.
[02:53:36.458 --> 02:53:40.441]  So pests can't develop an immunity, and they won't harm your children or pets.
[02:53:40.822 --> 02:53:44.245]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bed bugs, fleas,
[02:53:44.565 --> 02:53:45.025]  I think so.
[02:54:08.772 --> 02:54:09.892]  Alright, final segment.
[02:54:09.912 --> 02:54:11.313]  I should have gone to your calls earlier.
[02:54:11.593 --> 02:54:14.194]  Louis, Patty, Trina, Catherine, Steve, and the others.
[02:54:14.654 --> 02:54:15.014]  Holding.
[02:54:15.555 --> 02:54:16.415]  We'll try to get to all of you.
[02:54:16.435 --> 02:54:18.916]  Quick questions from Louis in Texas.
[02:54:18.936 --> 02:54:19.916]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:54:19.936 --> 02:54:21.757]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:54:22.277 --> 02:54:22.557]  Good.
[02:54:23.678 --> 02:54:24.598]  I know you're short on time.
[02:54:24.658 --> 02:54:25.858]  I'll call back some other day.
[02:54:26.239 --> 02:54:28.699]  But I just wanted to tell them about this book.
[02:54:29.620 --> 02:54:32.441]  I had it set up before by Mary Kay Baxter, Divine Revelation of Hell.
[02:54:32.461 --> 02:54:33.321]  I don't know if you've read it.
[02:54:33.421 --> 02:54:36.442]  Chapter 18 talks about the total enslavement.
[02:54:36.883 --> 02:54:37.663]  It's a prophecy.
[02:54:38.829 --> 02:54:40.430]  I just wanted to give you a call.
[02:54:40.670 --> 02:54:42.870]  I have two subjects for you.
[02:55:03.632 --> 02:55:05.673]  You know, follow of yours for about five years.
[02:55:06.074 --> 02:55:08.875]  I have all your CDs, all your DVDs and everything.
[02:55:09.016 --> 02:55:15.260]  And I was just watching a thing about, it was on Bill O'Reilly and it was Ron Paul.
[02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:22.284]  He was on the show doing Freemason handshakes and this YouTube thing was just showing a lot about Ron Paul.
[02:55:22.304 --> 02:55:24.726]  Alright ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, I appreciate your call and we're out of time.
[02:55:24.746 --> 02:55:26.427]  You can call me back tomorrow about that.
[02:55:28.510 --> 02:55:34.738]  You know, if you watch enough videos of me shaking hands, sometimes you'll see me grab somebody over the hand.
[02:55:35.339 --> 02:55:41.888]  Ron Paul is not a mason, but in South Texas in politics, I think there's a photo of him speaking at a lodge.
[02:55:41.908 --> 02:55:43.170]  A lot of people rent those out.
[02:55:45.111 --> 02:55:48.292]  It's about his principles and the fruit he has borne and auditing the Fed.
[02:55:49.013 --> 02:55:52.414]  And most people who are Masons are not higher level and not involved in anything evil.
[02:55:53.054 --> 02:56:01.257]  But you notice why I don't take a lot of calls because I got Wayne Madsen on about all these subjects and I said, calls for Wayne Madsen.
[02:56:02.137 --> 02:56:03.618]  And it's always all over the map.
[02:56:03.638 --> 02:56:06.380]  So I guess we'll have days where we just open the phones up to anything.
[02:56:06.881 --> 02:56:14.886]  But I guess I can't take calls with guests because my audience has gotten so conditioned to do whatever they want that they won't even ever talk to my guest.
[02:56:16.087 --> 02:56:20.491]  But I guess I'll ask Wayne Madsen about Ron Paul being a secret agent of the Masons.
[02:56:21.211 --> 02:56:22.112]  Any comments, Wayne?
[02:56:22.632 --> 02:56:31.641]  Well, I mean, you know, up in this town in D.C., you have to go to all kinds of groups to, first of all, fundraising, so you don't know where you're going to wind up and who you're talking to.
[02:56:31.721 --> 02:56:41.211]  So I, you know, if anybody winds up in a, you know, a Masonic Hall or a Jehovah's Witness or whatever, I mean, it doesn't really matter.
[02:56:41.251 --> 02:56:43.253]  It's really how they vote in Congress.
[02:56:43.673 --> 02:56:47.514]  You gotta judge a tree by its fruits, and Ron Paul's solid gold.
[02:56:47.534 --> 02:56:49.854]  Wayne, I look forward to talking to you soon.
[02:56:49.874 --> 02:56:56.695]  I'm gonna call you, if it's okay, in about 10 minutes after the show to talk about some other stuff with you, okay, bro?
[02:57:12.518 --> 02:57:13.078]  Super.
[02:57:13.419 --> 02:57:13.739]  Okay.
[02:57:14.159 --> 02:57:16.281]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:57:16.301 --> 02:57:17.362]  Be sure and support him, folks.
[02:57:17.742 --> 02:57:18.662]  He does a lot of great work.
[02:57:18.702 --> 02:57:19.223]  Thank you, Wayne.
[02:57:20.864 --> 02:57:21.985]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:22.465 --> 02:57:23.626]  I don't have time to do all these calls.
[02:57:23.686 --> 02:57:24.467]  You can call me tomorrow.
[02:57:24.507 --> 02:57:27.549]  Kathleen and Catherine, Steve, Mark, and others.
[02:57:28.469 --> 02:57:34.474]  Look, I've seen some of the videos saying bad things about Ron Paul, and I know he has really bad arthritis.
[02:57:34.494 --> 02:57:35.494]  He's had a lot of stuff.
[02:57:35.594 --> 02:57:41.659]  People have slowed down enough videos of me waving my hands in the air, and they've gotten me, you know, doing, you know, this.
[02:57:44.949 --> 02:57:45.549]  It's insane.
[02:57:47.351 --> 02:57:48.191]  It's totally insane.
[02:57:49.392 --> 02:57:57.438]  People say my MySpace, because it has like a ring of stars, like a dollar bill with me in it, some satanic interdimensional reptoid portal.
[02:57:58.078 --> 02:57:58.879]  Look, I'll tell you this.
[02:57:58.919 --> 02:57:59.579]  I'm a Christian.
[02:57:59.619 --> 02:58:00.700]  I'm fighting the New World Order.
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:03.502]  I know Ron Paul is a hard-working, good Christian man.
[02:58:03.562 --> 02:58:04.523]  I know some of his family.
[02:58:05.323 --> 02:58:06.744]  And I know his fruits are what matter.
[02:58:06.944 --> 02:58:13.369]  We got bigger problems to deal with instead of just imagining things where they're not there.
[02:58:14.977 --> 02:58:19.841]  I mean, we've had banks that have stolen 14 plus trillion dollars from us in eight months, seven months.
[02:58:20.141 --> 02:58:21.362]  Let's do something about that.
[02:58:21.762 --> 02:58:25.985]  But take Ron Paul having to run around and fundraise all day instead of fighting the New World Order.
[02:58:26.046 --> 02:58:29.128]  I'm the same way, having to try to make money to get the word out all day.

[02:58:37.574 --> 02:58:38.235]  Good job, crew.
[02:58:41.277 --> 02:58:44.139]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.379 --> 02:58:49.761]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.082 --> 02:58:52.663]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.783 --> 02:58:55.704]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[02:58:55.744 --> 02:58:57.405]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.525 --> 02:59:00.266]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.486 --> 02:59:03.348]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.528 --> 02:59:08.230]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.470 --> 02:59:09.390]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.590 --> 02:59:12.572]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:12.832 --> 02:59:19.735]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
