[00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.493]  My websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:08.396]  And joining us from Hawaii is Mike Rivero.
[00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:11.179]  Mike, good to have you on board with us with your once a month visit.
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.701]  Aloha, Alex.
[00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.062]  Thanks for having me on the show again.
[00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:15.464]  It's good to have you here.
[00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:17.686]  Okay, let's get into the economy first.
[00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.128]  They won't tell us where the money's going in specifics.
[00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.434]  They just say another $30 billion to AIG, well over $200 plus billion.
[00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:27.296]  Their third bailout now.
[00:00:27.336 --> 00:00:31.901]  They're saying it's nationalized, but when you really look at it, it's the private central banks
[00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:37.423]  through the government are just basically taking the money and won't say where it's going.
[00:00:37.443 --> 00:00:44.246]  But CBS News reported, as you know, last week, 250 plus billion of the bailout money to all these companies is going to the Caymans.
[00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:46.827]  And they're literally going offshore with it.
[00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:50.248]  Madoff's family has run down to South America.
[00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:56.290]  Most of the other bankers have been running to South America and to areas around
[00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:01.235]  The Pacific Ocean, they're going to the Cook Islands and other places.
[00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:04.339]  I mean, to me it's just such a...
[00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:14.206]  Such a fraud to know they're criminals, to know criminals run the government, to know Wall Street is run by crooks, to know they're setting up a world government.
[00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.147]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:17.127]  They should all be arrested.
[00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:18.228]  The new order should end.
[00:01:18.808 --> 00:01:21.470]  It's come out that Bush did want to end the First Amendment in America.
[00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.050]  We saw those talking points in the news.
[00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.152]  It's come out that Obama's lied about everything he said he would do.
[00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:32.555]  And they just continue forward, but at the same time, people are waking up.
[00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:36.357]  I keep saying this, but I mean, it's exploding by the day now, so can you speak to
[00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:36.866]  We're good to that.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.382]  Yeah, obviously, you know, Barack Obama's been this incredible disappointment.
[00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:45.045]  He's starting to talk about going after the Second Amendment, despite the U.S.
[00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:52.269]  Supreme Court decision that the Second Amendment does confer an individual right to keep and bear arms to all American citizens.
[00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.172]  And again, my biggest gripe with Barack Obama right now is that he is still campaigning.
[00:01:57.532 --> 00:02:06.438]  Every day he's out there someplace else doing another speech and trying to rally support and cheer us on, and that's all well and good for the campaign, but he's got the job now.
[00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:09.620]  And I'm wondering, when is he going to start actually doing it?
[00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:19.968]  Because I know he's a wonderful public speaker, but he's starting to give the impression that he's going out and making all these rah-rah speeches and cheerleading because he has no other idea what to do.
[00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.091]  Now as far as the economy and the bailouts are concerned and everything,
[00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:26.493]  It's a grand looting, is what it is.
[00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:32.958]  They're looting the American taxpayers, they're looting the Treasury, they're sticking it in their own pockets, and they're making for the border.
[00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:34.940]  And it is indeed very, very obvious.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.921]  More and more people are waking up.
[00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:46.128]  I got a very nice email from somebody I've known for many, many years just this morning, who said, I thought you were a nutcase all those years ago, and here you are, you are absolutely correct.
[00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.311]  We're starting to see this all over the place.
[00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:53.135]  I know I'm getting a lot more angry callers to my show and to my website.
[00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:55.497]  People are indeed waking up.
[00:02:55.898 --> 00:03:03.886]  Now they've got to decide what are they going to do and more to the point, it is obvious that the United States as we have known it to this point cannot survive much longer.
[00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:06.509]  We need to start planning what are we going to do afterwards.
[00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:21.520]  And meanwhile, for 30 years, but people paid attention to him in the last year, I kept explaining to people, folks, even if Ron Paul doesn't win, it's a victory because we create a massive buzz, we educate the college students and adults and everybody else during the debates.
[00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:24.943]  That the private banks have an inflation tax.
[00:03:24.963 --> 00:03:25.764]  They're scamming us.
[00:03:26.084 --> 00:03:27.225]  Derivatives are a fraud.
[00:03:27.265 --> 00:03:28.586]  They're going to inflate the currency.
[00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:32.168]  He did that and now he's bigger than he was a year ago.
[00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:33.609]  No one can ignore him.
[00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.072]  Everybody's waking up now through Ron Paul movement.
[00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:40.794]  They're coming to us just as they went to him through us.
[00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:43.957]  And he even said that on air that half his early support was from this show alone.
[00:03:44.817 --> 00:04:04.841]  It's symbiotic, and so now the hottest thing on the college campuses is true libertarian ideas, anti-New Order ideas, and the establishment is openly saying they're starting to get scared, and British newspapers yesterday said the British government is ready for martial law against the people if they try to remove the illegitimate government.
[00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:10.843]  They admit they're ready for martial law here, but I talked to the troops, and they're all waking up.
[00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.223]  The police are waking up.
[00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:14.952]  That's absolutely true.
[00:04:15.373 --> 00:04:19.394]  The bottom line is that the government by itself cannot impose a dictatorship.
[00:04:19.714 --> 00:04:21.375]  They've lost the trust of the soldiers.
[00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:23.795]  They've lost the trust of the law enforcement community.
[00:04:24.156 --> 00:04:26.956]  They've basically broken trust with the entire American people.
[00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:31.378]  And a government that has lost the trust of its people is a government that can no longer function.
[00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:36.001]  I truly am convinced that the United States is going to go the way of the Soviet Union.
[00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.484]  It is simply going to collapse from its own rot, corruption, and debt.
[00:04:40.805 --> 00:04:44.047]  And we seriously need to start thinking, what are we going to do?
[00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:47.129]  Let's look at how the Russians handled the collapse of the USSR.
[00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.530]  Learn from their mistakes.
[00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.491]  What did they do right?
[00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:50.111]  Let's do that.
[00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:50.952]  What did they do wrong?
[00:04:51.272 --> 00:04:52.033]  Let's avoid that.
[00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:53.454]  Getting rid of the oligarchs.
[00:04:53.494 --> 00:04:54.654]  Yeah, we need to look at that.
[00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:55.835]  And so forth.
[00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:58.737]  I really do feel we're on the verge of this tremendous transition.
[00:04:59.117 --> 00:05:00.298]  And yes, you are right.
[00:05:00.338 --> 00:05:06.162]  There are people who are trying to take advantage of this upset to impose their idea of what the new form of government should be.
[00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:16.509]  We need to be ready to say, no, we're going to take it back to this constitutionally based system where the central federal government does not have all of this incredible power.
[00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:20.952]  The states have the power and anything the states don't control, we the people
[00:05:21.192 --> 00:05:24.753]  We have our own sovereignty to take care of and to protect and to support.
[00:05:25.213 --> 00:05:31.994]  Mike Rivero joining us from Hawaii, live on the video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:32.194 --> 00:05:46.857]  Mike, the message I want to get out to people is that the elite is not invincible, they're not God, they have a lot of fancy toys, a lot of supercomputers to wargame things out, and they've wargamed it out, and they see their New World Order being defeated.
[00:05:47.924 --> 00:05:52.709]  I know they have a very small window, and I want listeners to understand, you have effected change.
[00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.092]  You have changed the destiny of the world.
[00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:56.473]  We're in the fight now.
[00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:58.716]  That doesn't mean we're winning, but we're in the fight.
[00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:01.859]  Now you realize that your enemy is not invincible.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.304]  Now at the same time, we have other problems though.
[00:06:06.444 --> 00:06:08.025]  As things implode, the government
[00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:16.915]  We'll be the only group that supposedly has fiat money to put, you know, money on people's welfare cards, on their food stamp cards.
[00:06:18.556 --> 00:06:23.899]  You know, a lot of government employees will be loyal just because they've got to have the job and the money for the house.
[00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:31.643]  And I have a news story from BBC, it was also in other publications, where basically in Virginia, counties
[00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:57.382]  Are, in one county, taking $50 million of taxpayer money and pledging it to SunTrust Bank to then have a lottery and give $90,000 plus free, $92,000, to select county employees on top of other incentives to basically get houses that were repossessed from citizens for free.
[00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:09.924]  Yeah, it's getting pretty absurd out there and more and more Americans are beginning to wake up and realize that your average government worker is paid considerably more for the same kind of work that's being done in the private sector.
[00:07:09.944 --> 00:07:15.107]  Something like a one-third gain plus additional guaranteed benefits, all of it on the taxpayers'
[00:07:15.707 --> 00:07:43.506]  Back if you will and the American taxpayers are getting tired of working their lives away in order to support the government in an elevated status and certainly now they're seeing the work of an entire lifetime dissolve as the government loots us to give the money to the Wall Street investment brokerages many of whom are now suspected of having gone bankrupt with these pyramid schemes that seem to have become the de facto substitution for actually manufacturing and selling products over the last 30 years.
[00:07:45.199 --> 00:08:03.349]  Well, we have the stock market down by over 50% now, below 7,000 as we speak, that key psychological threshold, and the government just accelerates the looting and stealing and thieving and is raising hundreds of new taxes, 80 plus in New York State alone.
[00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:09.293]  I mean, don't they understand that the people just can't pay all this money?
[00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:11.679]  Apparently they don't.
[00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:18.123]  I mean, they're still reaching out there with their big grasping claws just into the herd, trying to harvest a little bit more.
[00:08:18.523 --> 00:08:22.386]  And they don't get it, that we just don't have it anymore.
[00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:31.511]  There was an interesting little video that was run on the Daily Show where Congress was wasting its time talking about this bill to ban monkeys being sold across the border.
[00:08:32.072 --> 00:08:38.676]  And in the middle of that, one of the Congressmen says, you know, all it takes is $45,000 and a phone call to ship a monkey from this point to this point.
[00:08:39.196 --> 00:08:48.658]  And that was such a revealing statement because it proved that our Congress is so elevated in wealth and status that to them $45,000 is a trivial amount.
[00:08:49.118 --> 00:08:51.939]  You know, it was the phone call and $45,000 and you get a monkey.
[00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:57.900]  Don't they understand that $45,000 is more than most American families have to live on for an entire year?
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:04.882]  It is not a trivial issue and therefore this is not really a matter of concern that people can pick up a phone and buy a monkey.
[00:09:05.382 --> 00:09:09.565]  So why is our Congress worrying so much about that when everything else is going wrong?
[00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:15.928]  Now obviously Congress is busying itself with this kind of trivia because they don't know how to fix the big problems.
[00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:22.332]  And this gets back to what I said about Barack Obama continuing to go out on the campaign trail even though he's already run the office.
[00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:30.077]  People are starting to perceive that all of this speech making is a cover for the fact that the government absolutely doesn't know how to fix the economy.
[00:09:30.157 --> 00:09:32.919]  It's going to continue to deteriorate and right now
[00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:38.042]  Our corporate leadership and our governmental leadership, they're getting this every-man-for-themself mentality.
[00:09:38.062 --> 00:09:41.985]  They're going to grab as much as they can while we let them get away with it.
[00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:43.086]  That's right.
[00:09:43.206 --> 00:09:49.350]  When a society like Mexico or North Korea or whatever is collapsing, always the looting accelerates.
[00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:50.711]  And this is all by design.
[00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:51.612]  We have their documents.
[00:09:51.912 --> 00:09:59.097]  We know Obama's job is to stall the public, that he's going to fix things just long enough for the looting to be completed.
[00:10:00.376 --> 00:10:03.497]  And then he's going to be basically a sacrificial goat politically.
[00:10:04.017 --> 00:10:07.719]  You know, they're going to kill him politically, not physically, in front of everybody.
[00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:09.479]  I mean, that is the great betrayal.
[00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:12.360]  That is the setup here that's being done.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.520]  And so that's why he goes out.
[00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:20.103]  Congress is having to, you know, do things like try to ban people owning chimpanzees because they are ceremonial.
[00:10:20.163 --> 00:10:22.023]  They can't see the Homeland Security plans.
[00:10:22.503 --> 00:10:23.864]  PD 51, the full text.
[00:10:24.504 --> 00:10:29.606]  They're not allowed to read the banker takeover bills until one hour before the committee chairman give it to them.
[00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.248]  And so, they have to do things like this.
[00:10:33.548 --> 00:10:40.033]  Yeah, and you know, the last official act of any government is to loot the nation, and I think that's the stage that we're at right now.
[00:10:40.093 --> 00:10:43.075]  They're going to grab everything that they can, they're going to take everything that they can.
[00:10:43.995 --> 00:10:47.838]  Just like Nazi Germany did, it'll come down to knocking the gold out of your teeth.
[00:10:48.138 --> 00:10:54.202]  And they're going to put it in their bank accounts, and they're going to split, and they're going to leave we the people to deal with the wreckage.
[00:10:54.682 --> 00:10:55.122]  That's right.
[00:10:55.162 --> 00:11:01.145]  In fact, by 42, a lot of Nazis, when it looked like Hitler was even winning, were leaving and going to Latin America.
[00:11:01.485 --> 00:11:02.686]  The same thing's been happening here.
[00:11:02.766 --> 00:11:04.206]  These globalists are all leaving.
[00:11:04.466 --> 00:11:05.547]  They've been leaving for years.
[00:11:05.607 --> 00:11:06.867]  They know what they're doing.
[00:11:08.828 --> 00:11:09.609]  Just amazing.
[00:11:09.729 --> 00:11:11.410]  Just absolutely incredible.
[00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.570]  Mike Rovero is our guest.
[00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.111]  We're going to come back and get into a host of news.
[00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:20.634]  Like Bush, the memos are now out, wanting to ban the First Amendment in the United States.
[00:11:21.034 --> 00:11:22.334]  That's what they wanted to do.
[00:11:22.835 --> 00:11:23.575]  But we didn't let them.
[00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:28.037]  Newsflash!
[00:11:28.457 --> 00:11:30.079]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:35.285]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[00:11:36.714 --> 00:11:40.638]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[00:11:40.698 --> 00:11:44.901]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[00:11:45.322 --> 00:11:51.087]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[00:11:52.007 --> 00:12:00.435]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.
[00:12:00.655 --> 00:12:04.258]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[00:12:06.732 --> 00:12:07.153]  We're good to go.
[00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:36.368]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:43.557]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:12:43.877 --> 00:12:47.459]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.002]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:12:51.242 --> 00:12:52.963]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:12:53.003 --> 00:12:58.747]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.949]  I think so.

[00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:31.555]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:14:31.715 --> 00:14:36.117]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:14:36.277 --> 00:14:40.800]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.361]  It's a documented fact.
[00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:49.844]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.

[00:15:16.536 --> 00:15:16.736]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:15:16.756 --> 00:15:17.976]  I keep repeating it over and over again.
[00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:18.357]  It's simple.
[00:15:18.457 --> 00:15:20.598]  What the globalists are doing is so obviously criminal.
[00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:46.407]  On the record, so evil, so classically tyrannical, that all we have to do is get up and stand up and say, no criminals, no!
[00:15:47.188 --> 00:15:48.890]  We are not going along with this!
[00:15:49.871 --> 00:15:50.071]  Now...
[00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:58.075]  Going back five years ago, I said clearly there are talking points to say that protesting is illegal and police are being told this.
[00:15:58.535 --> 00:16:03.196]  That's why police will dress up like anarchists and go out and attack other cops all across the United States.
[00:16:03.216 --> 00:16:03.736]  They've been caught.
[00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:04.517]  Mainstream news.
[00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:05.837]  The latest was Denver.
[00:16:05.877 --> 00:16:06.817]  Denver Post headlines.
[00:16:06.857 --> 00:16:07.838]  The police admit they did it.
[00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:09.098]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:10.118]  Attacking other cops.
[00:16:10.198 --> 00:16:11.279]  The other cops didn't even know.
[00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:12.279]  Very dangerous.
[00:16:13.704 --> 00:16:24.406]  And, because they're told, well, the people protesting the war are protesting our fight against terror, so they're helping terrorists, so we're going to, you know, to save America, we're going to violate the First Amendment.
[00:16:24.886 --> 00:16:30.428]  And it's come out in these John Yoo memos that they said, we're getting around Posse Comitatus claiming it's anti-terror.
[00:16:31.228 --> 00:16:32.528]  And now they admit it's for the American people.
[00:16:32.568 --> 00:16:33.528]  Obama's expanding that.
[00:16:33.548 --> 00:16:37.049]  You know, Brigade Homeland and all these headlines in the Army Times.
[00:16:38.726 --> 00:16:43.568]  They are, just, the battle plan is in these group of memos.
[00:16:43.588 --> 00:16:47.249]  They're up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, also WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:54.932]  Mike Rivero, I have to say, though, that this is the first good thing Obama's actually done.
[00:16:54.952 --> 00:17:01.635]  Now, he's been protecting Bush on torture memos and secret arrest memos and got a lot of heat for that.
[00:17:01.695 --> 00:17:03.216]  He's keeping camps open.
[00:17:03.516 --> 00:17:05.917]  He's backing Bush on no rights for detainees.
[00:17:07.077 --> 00:17:08.738]  Why do you think he's done this?
[00:17:08.758 --> 00:17:11.560]  I know courts were ordering it to be released, but Bush had been ignoring it.
[00:17:12.121 --> 00:17:14.582]  I mean, this is giving us a bone.
[00:17:14.903 --> 00:17:16.304]  So I have to give credit where it's due.
[00:17:16.324 --> 00:17:19.646]  This is the first thing I have seen him do that was good.
[00:17:21.266 --> 00:17:29.032]  Well, sooner or later, Obama has to realize he's got to start keeping some of his campaign promises in some form or other.
[00:17:29.452 --> 00:17:40.461]  I've taken to calling him our token president, not because of his skin color, but because so far the majority of everything he's done in line with his campaign promises have been token measures only.
[00:17:41.242 --> 00:17:49.328]  Closing Guantanamo, yeah, that's actually going to happen, but the prisoners aren't being released, they're not being apologized to, they're just being sent someplace else where we can't see it.
[00:17:49.448 --> 00:17:50.549]  They're not getting the process.
[00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:51.309]  He said that.
[00:17:51.369 --> 00:17:52.329]  They're going to other camps.
[00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.330]  Yes.
[00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.531]  And the same thing with Iraq.
[00:17:55.571 --> 00:17:56.892]  He was going to end the war in Iraq.
[00:17:56.932 --> 00:18:00.674]  Well, I'm bringing the troops home, except for the 50,000 we're going to leave there permanently.
[00:18:01.174 --> 00:18:06.877]  And so I think already a high degree of mistrust is already beginning to build up around Barack Obama.
[00:18:06.917 --> 00:18:11.299]  And I think at some point he's going to realize he's got to actually do something that looks positive.
[00:18:12.163 --> 00:18:16.488]  For the American people, or he's going to lose their support completely for anything he's going to try and do.
[00:18:16.908 --> 00:18:17.288]  That's right.
[00:18:17.348 --> 00:18:27.558]  There are real revolts in the mid-level House members that have some subcommittee chairmanships going, look, Patriot Act, torture, lying about WMDs.
[00:18:27.718 --> 00:18:35.106]  Our constituents are saying we are going to be thrown out on our butts if we don't have hearings on Bush, and those hearings could lead
[00:18:36.006 --> 00:18:43.192]  You know, to a real investigation and at least publicly more of the corruption can come out so that it can be exposed for what it was.
[00:18:43.252 --> 00:18:45.693]  So at least it can be convicted in the court of public opinion.
[00:18:46.074 --> 00:18:52.999]  So I think that's what's forcing this is a rebellion within the Democrats thanks to the grassroots getting mad about what they're doing.
[00:18:54.042 --> 00:18:54.622]  Absolutely.
[00:18:54.762 --> 00:19:06.687]  It all begins with the people getting angry and demanding action because when they look out those windows and they see a million Americans who are getting angry and they realize they better do something because we're so close to a revolt right now.
[00:19:06.747 --> 00:19:09.369]  What happened in Iceland could happen here.
[00:19:09.629 --> 00:19:12.170]  What's about to happen in Ireland could happen here.
[00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.671]  What already did happen in Romania
[00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:15.932]  Could happen here.
[00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:26.366]  We're so close to the edge and the government knows it and they know that in a stand-up fight with the entire American people on one side and the government on the other, the government's gonna lose and we're going to see a return.
[00:19:27.007 --> 00:19:32.815]  There'll be a revolution and a revolutionary tribunal and we will not be gentle on those who destroyed our country.
[00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:35.913]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:37.714]  You know, I've been meaning for two weeks to play this.
[00:19:37.734 --> 00:19:39.355]  I'm going to play it coming up before you leave us.
[00:19:39.715 --> 00:19:46.717]  A few weeks ago, as you know, Zbigniew Brzezinski was on MSNBC the morning Joe saying, I'm concerned about riots.
[00:19:46.857 --> 00:19:48.658]  I'm concerned about martial law.
[00:19:48.678 --> 00:19:55.160]  You know, I'm concerned about the people going after the bankers as if he's not the guy behind it orchestrating much of it on record.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.001]  And then we also see Glenn Beck saying, what do we do about the babas and their guns?
[00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:01.742]  And the CIA guys on the show said, let it come.
[00:20:02.122 --> 00:20:15.986]  So there's also a danger in that we've seen big foundations, the Ford Foundation and others, not just have police provocateur and riots, but actually staging violent events during demonstrations to demonize it and have a pretext to bring in martial law.
[00:20:16.026 --> 00:20:17.767]  So I don't want riots.
[00:20:18.727 --> 00:20:26.478]  But if we do have mass demonstrations, which I do want, I hope they're more like Iceland, where they're somewhat peaceful and where provocateurs are identified.
[00:20:27.868 --> 00:20:34.531]  I would agree with that, and like I said, I am convinced that the ultimate fate of the United States is identical to that of the Soviet Union.
[00:20:34.812 --> 00:20:42.315]  The people are just going to quit trusting the government, they're going to quit doing as they're told, they're going to quit supporting and paying for it all, and the government will simply collapse.
[00:20:42.555 --> 00:20:49.919]  There'll be a period of confusion, and we will create a new nation which will take care of our needs, and not the needs of just the corporate wealthy.
[00:20:52.174 --> 00:20:53.975]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:20:53.995 --> 00:20:55.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:28.321]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:35.843]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:21:36.083 --> 00:21:37.483]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:21:37.703 --> 00:21:41.604]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:21:41.864 --> 00:21:45.445]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:21:45.685 --> 00:21:49.726]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:21:50.906 --> 00:21:54.167]  One is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:21:54.487 --> 00:21:58.268]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[00:21:58.608 --> 00:22:02.909]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:06.790]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com.

[00:22:23.803 --> 00:22:30.206]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:30.566 --> 00:22:32.547]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:34.248]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:34.769 --> 00:22:35.289]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:35.569 --> 00:22:36.449]  This is his ammo.
[00:22:36.469 --> 00:22:37.910]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.631]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:22:39.931 --> 00:22:46.675]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:22:47.075 --> 00:22:47.515]  Some U.S.
[00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:53.218]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:22:53.898 --> 00:22:57.380]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.481]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:23:23.772 --> 00:23:27.396]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:23:27.496 --> 00:23:33.102]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:23:33.222 --> 00:23:37.266]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:23:37.566 --> 00:23:39.849]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:45.935]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[00:23:46.035 --> 00:23:46.495]  I don't know.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.341]  Nature's Gem Golden Flax is pure.

[00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:20.065]  Has he been trotted on the wine spread?
[00:24:20.105 --> 00:24:20.866]  Much too long, street girl.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:49.712]  The establishment is counting on the public being totally ignorant.
[00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:01.191]  Yes, sir!
[00:25:17.495 --> 00:25:19.416]  With quote, tighter regulations.
[00:25:20.136 --> 00:25:24.699]  And I love how every day I see Rahm Emanuel on television, saw him on Fox Sunday.
[00:25:25.239 --> 00:25:29.141]  I see Obama in speeches saying, we're going to get tough on these banks and brokerage firms.
[00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:31.602]  We're going to go after the people that did this.
[00:25:32.362 --> 00:25:40.907]  And then meanwhile, it's literally Larry Summers and Geithner and the very crew that is in the White House now.
[00:25:41.827 --> 00:25:42.448]  We're good to go.
[00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:06.293]  Clinton, Obama, they're all like people running a marathon, handing off the batons.
[00:26:06.393 --> 00:26:14.377]  But, this plan we're now under was initiated, it was planned in the 70s, but initiated in the mid to late 90s, on record!
[00:26:15.677 --> 00:26:17.838]  And Mike Rivera, you've covered this for years.
[00:26:17.918 --> 00:26:28.383]  What is it like to see them up there, posing as the saviors and the arbiters of this, who are going to be our guardians, knowing that they are the very cats that did this?
[00:26:29.451 --> 00:26:39.082]  Well, it's a common ploy of government to create a crisis and then sell us the solution, and we've seen it repeated over and over and over again.
[00:26:39.362 --> 00:26:49.333]  But there is no question that beginning with the Reagan presidency, which is when the United States went from being the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor nation,
[00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:55.314]  That was the beginning of this process of bringing the United States to the edge of this collapse.
[00:26:55.754 --> 00:27:12.758]  Now, the problem, I think, from the point of view of the globalists, is that because of the alternative media, your show, my show, and the websites, the people of the world are aware that it is globalism that has turned an economic upset inside the United States into a global problem.
[00:27:13.138 --> 00:27:19.703]  And so this idea of selling more globalism as the solution, that's going to be a very, very tough sell, and I don't think they can pull it off.
[00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:30.891]  They're going to push as hard as they can to say, yes, more of the same is the solution to making everything better, but already I'm seeing people just digging their heels in and saying, no, I want to be left alone.
[00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:38.516]  I don't want another layer of economic experts living over me, piled onto my back while I try and stagger through life.
[00:27:38.796 --> 00:27:42.419]  I want you to just go away, let me grow my food, take care of my family, and
[00:27:43.024 --> 00:27:48.506]  Well, we saw a thousand to one, according to Congress, phone calls against the Banker Takeover Bill known as the Banker Bailout.
[00:28:00.868 --> 00:28:08.776]  We saw more people for the, quote, economic stimulus because they thought it was for the public, but it was still only about, depending on the poll, 10 to 15 percent that supported that.
[00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:13.641]  You get upwards of 90 percent in Gallup polls that want to control the borders, but the establishment won't do that.
[00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:16.924]  Upwards of 80 percent against the wars, but the establishment just continues that.
[00:28:16.984 --> 00:28:19.347]  I mean, really, it's not just the trust that's been broken.
[00:28:19.827 --> 00:28:29.716]  There is no illusion now with anybody I talk to out there, no matter what they claim their political ideology is, that the establishment is representing the people or the Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[00:28:29.776 --> 00:28:33.079]  I mean, this is a rogue government in every sense.
[00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:36.121]  But specifically, Mike, how do you see this collapsing?
[00:28:36.141 --> 00:28:38.984]  I mean, how do you see this unwinding and unraveling?
[00:28:40.705 --> 00:28:46.510]  I mean, I agree with you that it's going into collapse, but they want to have a controlled collapse where they collapse it all down and scoop it up.
[00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:49.772]  But I do see it not going well for them.
[00:28:49.832 --> 00:28:50.973]  I think they've overreached here.
[00:28:51.033 --> 00:28:57.338]  But they've programmed the Christian churches that whenever government corruption happens, it's the Antichrist and the end of the world.
[00:28:57.819 --> 00:29:02.142]  And so lay down to the face-scanning cameras, the national ID card, the thumbprints to buy and sell.
[00:29:02.542 --> 00:29:04.844]  It's the end of the world when clearly it's not.
[00:29:05.324 --> 00:29:06.986]  And regardless, it's our job to fight evil.
[00:29:07.887 --> 00:29:11.470]  So the infiltration of the churches, I see that as one of the biggest problems.
[00:29:11.511 --> 00:29:13.833]  So A, how do you see this unwinding?
[00:29:13.853 --> 00:29:15.615]  I mean, break it down in your minds.
[00:29:15.695 --> 00:29:16.696]  I want your perspective.
[00:29:17.057 --> 00:29:27.288]  And then B, do you get the point I'm making about how the biggest block out there of my fellow Christians just sit around going, praise God the police state's here, Jesus is about to come back.
[00:29:28.379 --> 00:29:30.100]  Yeah, that is a big, big problem.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:39.263]  The religious mythologies of this country have been exploited not only by our own government, but by the government of Israel as well, and people have been trained from birth.
[00:29:39.684 --> 00:29:40.444]  Don't do anything.
[00:29:40.484 --> 00:29:41.144]  Don't fight back.
[00:29:41.184 --> 00:29:45.766]  Just stay on your knees, clasp your hands together, and pray, and God will make it all better in the end.
[00:29:45.926 --> 00:29:47.487]  Obviously, that is not happening.
[00:29:48.327 --> 00:29:49.448]  As far as the U.S.
[00:29:49.508 --> 00:29:53.369]  government, we're heading toward a point where somebody's going to default on something.
[00:29:53.609 --> 00:29:54.890]  They're already talking about a U.S.
[00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:55.250]  default.
[00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.631]  They're talking about losing the AAA credit rating of the United States government.
[00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:03.173]  At some point, if the American people simply stop cooperating,
[00:30:03.473 --> 00:30:04.293]  Like Gandhi did.
[00:30:04.393 --> 00:30:05.894]  Peaceful non-cooperation.
[00:30:06.274 --> 00:30:07.695]  We stop paying into the system.
[00:30:07.955 --> 00:30:09.035]  We send out a message.
[00:30:09.455 --> 00:30:14.597]  No, we will not be the guarantor of any future investments in the United States.
[00:30:14.858 --> 00:30:16.058]  That's what all these bailouts are.
[00:30:16.078 --> 00:30:18.259]  That's what the SNL bailout in the 1980s was.
[00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:25.622]  Was the US government proving that they could trick the American taxpayer into making up for investments in the US that didn't work out.
[00:30:26.062 --> 00:30:39.028]  The instant we can put out the message saying, no, we're not going to pay for that anymore, then all those foreign investors are going to start pulling their money out all at once, and that is when we're going to have a real run on the American economy, and it's all going to come down and drag the U.S.
[00:30:39.048 --> 00:30:39.648]  government with it.
[00:30:39.969 --> 00:30:40.889]  It has to happen.
[00:30:41.009 --> 00:30:42.530]  The only question is when.
[00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.511]  Well, it's like Russell Means, the Native American leader, said here.
[00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:47.212]  They're letting us down easy, though.
[00:30:47.232 --> 00:30:51.534]  I mean, people think this is harsh, but they're just incrementally dropping the stock market.
[00:30:51.554 --> 00:30:54.335]  They'll jack it back up probably again and then drop it down even further.
[00:30:54.915 --> 00:30:58.157]  It'll probably go back up to $8,000 again and then race down to $5,000, then go up to $9,000, race down to $3,000.
[00:31:00.818 --> 00:31:01.818]  I mean, this is happening.
[00:31:01.858 --> 00:31:02.639]  It's gone below 7,000.
[00:31:03.079 --> 00:31:06.580]  Everything Bob Chapman and others have been saying is true.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:28.027]  And, you know, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who was the head of policy at the Treasury under Reagan, who decried Bush, has now come out and said in editorials, he's coming on tomorrow, he's now come out and said, look, I'm sorry, it looks like Obama is even worse than Bush, because he's able to con the public and sucker at least one portion of the population to go along with this.
[00:31:29.423 --> 00:31:43.990]  Well, that is true for the moment, but again, I think public confidence and trust in Obama is definitely eroding already, and if anything, if you look back at the first year of Bush's administration, I think he actually kept the trust of the American people for a little bit longer.
[00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:57.877]  I think it's happening faster with Barack Obama, and that is because the American people are far more skeptical, they're far less trusting, and I think that's due to you and I and the other GCN hosts and the blogosphere in general.
[00:31:58.337 --> 00:32:07.084]  And I think Barack Obama, now that he's got the job, they're saying, you know, it's time to prove that you know how to do the job you said you did, and he's coming up short time and time again.
[00:32:07.164 --> 00:32:27.021]  And one token give to the American people on one of these court cases is not going to make up for the fact that the economy does continue to deteriorate, and everything Obama is doing is of the same ilk as Bush, which is we're going to take trillions of dollars from the American people and give it to the banks.
[00:32:27.381 --> 00:32:29.205]  We've finally gotten more numbers.
[00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:36.038]  First, the FBI was saying that in the last two months of last year, gun sales total were up by 44%.
[00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:45.186]  Over the previous record, because they have the instant check where they call in to register you as a gun owner and basically what type of gun you've got.
[00:32:45.807 --> 00:32:46.968]  Now they're saying it's up over 100%.
[00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.214]  Guns are sold out in many places, many calibers of ammo are sold out.
[00:32:52.915 --> 00:32:53.856]  What does Obama do?
[00:32:53.936 --> 00:32:57.240]  He's got his Attorney General come out and say, yeah, we're going to introduce an assault weapons ban.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.043]  But tag on to it, physically banning the guns.
[00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:02.885]  Not just the sale of them anymore, but physically having them.
[00:33:03.326 --> 00:33:09.812]  And we're going to make you have psychological testing, federal registration, federal licensing, and then gun sales explode even more.
[00:33:09.832 --> 00:33:14.017]  I mean, don't they understand that the people are on to them?
[00:33:15.598 --> 00:33:32.997]  Apparently not, and one of the big problems I think when you have a too large government or too large corporation is the people at the top are sitting on layer after layer after layer of these mid-managers whose own jobs depend on making sure that bad information does not pass either going up or going down.
[00:33:33.337 --> 00:33:35.079]  They don't want the subordinates to give up hope.
[00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:37.061]  They don't want the superiors to crack down.
[00:33:37.441 --> 00:33:47.050]  So I think the real danger here is that people at Barack Obama's level or CEO levels, they really are very disconnected with what's going on on the streets of America.
[00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:54.517]  And I think the proof of that is that they really do seem to not understand that we are not being fooled by any of this stuff anymore.
[00:33:54.737 --> 00:33:58.281]  They're still out there trying to push this war on Iran with this idea that Iran is
[00:33:58.741 --> 00:34:00.722]  On the verge of building nuclear weapons.
[00:34:01.062 --> 00:34:05.723]  And somebody really thinks we're stupid enough to fall for this a second time in a row.
[00:34:05.983 --> 00:34:21.228]  But the good news is, in the lead up to the Iraq War in 2001, 2002, into March of 2003, we're about to have the anniversary of six years of mass murder and occupation, and 1,300,000, according to Lancet, very credible source, dead.
[00:34:22.128 --> 00:34:32.394]  And Ron Paul goes to the CPAC conservative function, says we killed over a million Iraqis, says it's wrong, says the troops gave me more money than any other candidate in both parties, and they cheer him.
[00:34:32.474 --> 00:34:37.777]  So that shows the illusion that conservatives are all for war is another fraud.
[00:34:38.917 --> 00:34:44.980]  So fraud after fraud is being exposed here, but yes, they had that admiral Saturday on CNN
[00:34:46.181 --> 00:35:12.217]  say Iran has the material to make nukes and is making them and then CNN had to retract, AFP had to retract and say he says they might have it and they retracted again and said well they're not sure that even if they might have it so so they're being forced to retract now whereas before they claim he had rail guns and he had EMP weapons that would destroy all electronics and put us in the dark age and you know he had all these super weapons
[00:35:12.557 --> 00:35:13.978]  And they're trying the same thing with Iran.
[00:35:13.998 --> 00:35:21.603]  They've got super-weapon drones, and they've got super-weapon nukes, and they've got super, you know, Mars-based alien technology.
[00:35:21.623 --> 00:35:22.384]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:35:22.724 --> 00:35:24.145]  And it's not working!
[00:35:25.487 --> 00:35:26.148]  No, it isn't.
[00:35:26.208 --> 00:35:35.216]  But the fact that they keep trying it, either they simply have no choice but to continue to perpetuate this war, or they really do think the American people are that stupid.
[00:35:35.256 --> 00:35:36.738]  Possibly it's a combination of the two.
[00:35:37.198 --> 00:35:43.184]  But the reality is that the United States had an economic crash in 1904 that it didn't get out of until it got into World War I.
[00:35:43.524 --> 00:35:46.727]  We had the crash of 29, which we didn't get out of until we had the World War II.
[00:35:47.047 --> 00:35:51.451]  We've had the crash of 2008, and I think the conventional wisdom in Washington, D.C.
[00:35:51.471 --> 00:36:11.828]  is that the only way they can survive and perpetuate their power is to start a new major global war on the assumption, and we know what assume means, that the American people will forget all about the lies and all about the torture and all about the loss of our freedoms and all about the economic troubles, and we'll line up behind the flag and we'll salute as we march our kids off to yet another war in the desert.
[00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:18.393]  Let's go ahead and play this Zbigniew Brzezinski clip where he's acting like the good guy and I'm seeing them all do this.
[00:36:18.473 --> 00:36:19.714]  Oh, the bankers are so evil.
[00:36:20.054 --> 00:36:21.455]  I'm worried what the people are going to do.
[00:36:21.495 --> 00:36:23.736]  Meanwhile, they've engineered this whole thing.
[00:36:23.916 --> 00:36:24.396]  Here it is.
[00:36:26.878 --> 00:36:35.903]  We've been talking about the disappearance of the middle class, something you've been concerned about, but you also talk about the possibility of
[00:36:37.166 --> 00:36:38.066]  Class conflict.
[00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:44.468]  I've been sort of worrying about it, because, look, we're going to have millions and millions of unemployed.
[00:36:45.149 --> 00:36:47.449]  People really facing dire straits.
[00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:53.511]  And we're going to be having that for some period of time, before things hopefully improve.
[00:36:54.471 --> 00:37:06.535]  And at the same time, there is this public awareness of this extraordinary wealth that was transferred to a few individuals at levels without historical precedent in America.
[00:37:07.378 --> 00:37:12.581]  People who made billions of dollars, millions of dollars in a short period of time.
[00:37:13.021 --> 00:37:14.642]  I sort of collected some figures on this.
[00:37:14.962 --> 00:37:16.543]  I mean, they're really kind of staggering.
[00:37:17.323 --> 00:37:25.888]  And you sort of say to yourself, what's going to happen in this society when these people are without jobs, when their families hurt, when they lose their homes and so forth?
[00:37:26.408 --> 00:37:28.309]  We have the government trying to repair.
[00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:32.331]  Repair the banking system, to build the housing out.
[00:37:33.467 --> 00:37:34.588]  What about the rich class?
[00:37:34.688 --> 00:37:35.148]  Where is it?
[00:37:35.488 --> 00:37:36.188]  What is it doing?
[00:37:36.849 --> 00:37:45.994]  It sort of struck me that in 1907, when we had a massive banking crisis, when banks were beginning to collapse, there were going to be riots on the streets.
[00:37:46.594 --> 00:37:49.175]  Some financiers, led by J.P.
[00:37:49.215 --> 00:37:50.416]  Morgan, got together.
[00:37:51.076 --> 00:37:53.158]  He locked them in his library at one point.
[00:37:54.798 --> 00:37:56.860]  He wouldn't let them out until 4.45 a.m.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.182]  until they all kicked in and gave some money to
[00:38:01.986 --> 00:38:02.867]  Stabilize the banks.
[00:38:02.907 --> 00:38:04.589]  There was no Federal Reserve System at the time.
[00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.831]  Where is the money class today?
[00:38:07.312 --> 00:38:08.473]  Why aren't they doing something?
[00:38:08.513 --> 00:38:10.755]  The people who made billions, millions.
[00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:14.379]  I'm sort of thinking of Paulson or Rubin.
[00:38:15.079 --> 00:38:16.381]  Why don't they get together?
[00:38:17.381 --> 00:38:22.727]  And why don't they organize a National Solidarity Fund?
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.248]  In which they call upon all those who made these extraordinary amounts of money.
[00:38:28.629 --> 00:38:29.510]  Alright, let's stop there.
[00:38:30.632 --> 00:38:34.820]  What's happening here is when you hear the big central bankers saying we want to shut down
[00:38:36.255 --> 00:38:37.056]  Shadow banking.
[00:38:37.617 --> 00:38:44.386]  It's the same thing you see in Mexico where the big drug cartels of the government are waging war against the medium-sized and small ones to consolidate.
[00:38:44.806 --> 00:38:45.627]  That's what's happening.
[00:38:45.647 --> 00:38:52.576]  The mega-bankers, some of these brokerage heads made, one guy made $3 billion in two years, you know, one president of a brokerage firm.
[00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:54.299]  I mean, that's mass theft.
[00:38:55.362 --> 00:38:56.483]  They know what they're doing.
[00:38:57.183 --> 00:39:03.949]  And so now they're going to pose and say, look, we're, you know, we gave 200 and something million dollars to the American people, $15 every two weeks.
[00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:06.671]  Of course, we stole $9.7 trillion, so they are doing that.
[00:39:07.071 --> 00:39:17.499]  So this shows they're scared, though, that they're already positioning themselves that, oh, we want to help you, but we want to get these millionaires, as if millionaires have anything to do with this.
[00:39:18.139 --> 00:39:21.942]  This is Brzezinski actually hyping up class warfare.
[00:39:22.182 --> 00:39:22.743]  Mike Rivero.
[00:39:23.991 --> 00:39:25.112]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:26.374 --> 00:39:32.660]  We're hearing all of these attempts to scapegoat different groups for what's going on, like the subprime mortgage borrowers.
[00:39:34.402 --> 00:39:40.849]  What Brzezinski is attempting to do is shift the burden away from the government, which ultimately manages everything,
[00:39:41.749 --> 00:39:44.711]  Well, it's up to the rich people to fix it since they benefited from it.
[00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:51.815]  But that's obviously not true because government makes far more money off the American people than any rich individuals do.
[00:39:51.855 --> 00:40:01.421]  And yes, we may talk about these brokerage CEOs who became billionaires in the space of a few years because of the derivatives games going on, but look at how much money the government takes from us.
[00:40:02.022 --> 00:40:05.804]  And what Brzezinski is talking about is the private banker equivalent
[00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:09.687]  Well, obviously you never hear them talk about, let's arrest all these people, let's charge them.
[00:40:35.086 --> 00:40:37.447]  Let's nationalize the private Federal Reserve.
[00:40:37.487 --> 00:40:39.368]  Instead, it's the private Federal Reserve.
[00:40:39.408 --> 00:40:40.629]  They're still saying it's private.
[00:40:40.669 --> 00:40:42.690]  Let's have it nationalize everything.
[00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.691]  That's a trick, because it's private.
[00:40:44.731 --> 00:40:46.752]  It's really them hijacking everything.
[00:40:48.133 --> 00:40:49.273]  Yeah, and they've been doing it since 1913.
[00:40:50.234 --> 00:40:58.878]  And the problem with the Federal Reserve System, and any debt-based monetary system, is the instant it goes into effect, more money is owed than actually exists.
[00:40:59.218 --> 00:41:01.559]  And that's a big reason we're in so much trouble right now.
[00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:02.940]  Because on paper,
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.181]  All these trillions of dollars are owed.
[00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:07.262]  It doesn't exist anywhere.
[00:41:07.442 --> 00:41:21.429]  There's no place from which to get it to pay off the debts, and that is why the government is scrambling to simply harvest as much cash as it can from the American people to make up these bookkeeping entries in these various corporate investment brokers.
[00:41:21.449 --> 00:41:22.490]  Well, they're not even really doing that.
[00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.351]  They're just shoveling the money offshore to their own private islands.
[00:41:25.892 --> 00:41:30.274]  Mike, when we come back, I want to specifically get into the fact that we've already had the collapse happen.
[00:41:31.114 --> 00:41:38.139]  As bad as things are, you know, if we weren't in this artificial economy, they couldn't just flip the money off like a light switch and the whole country grinds to a halt.
[00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:42.942]  I mean, you know, only third world one crop economy should behave like that.
[00:41:43.302 --> 00:41:47.925]  This is a multi-cropped economy and it's falling apart by design.
[00:41:48.286 --> 00:41:50.107]  I want to talk to you about how you see this.
[00:41:50.127 --> 00:41:53.789]  I already brought this question up and I want you to specifically speak on it in detail.
[00:41:54.110 --> 00:42:00.314]  How you see the breakdown happening on the bad side if we don't get involved and take action and fill that power vacuum or
[00:42:01.114 --> 00:42:03.896]  In these uncertain times, safety and precaution are key.
[00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.811]  Don't rely on others for protection.
[00:42:31.212 --> 00:42:34.534]  Protect yourself and your family with products from Pepperspray.com.

[00:42:57.592 --> 00:42:58.933]  Easily accessible pepper spray

[00:43:23.368 --> 00:43:25.389]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:43:25.509 --> 00:43:27.910]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:30.151]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:43:30.211 --> 00:43:31.732]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:43:31.792 --> 00:43:33.353]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:43:33.473 --> 00:43:36.274]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:43:36.294 --> 00:43:39.996]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:43:49.669 --> 00:43:55.702]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:43:55.802 --> 00:43:56.905]  An inside job.
[00:43:58.314 --> 00:43:59.655]  How dare you?
[00:43:59.775 --> 00:44:05.797]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:44:05.977 --> 00:44:08.638]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:44:08.718 --> 00:44:15.141]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:29.512]  You are not alone.
[00:44:30.033 --> 00:44:32.556]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[00:44:32.897 --> 00:44:37.663]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[00:44:37.963 --> 00:44:39.706]  Signs include itching, pulling,
[00:44:40.046 --> 00:44:40.726]  We're good to go!

[00:45:26.145 --> 00:45:32.187]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:45:32.787 --> 00:45:35.768]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:43.034]  That's right, don't forget the free podcast that over 125,000 people download a day for free.
[00:45:43.915 --> 00:45:47.837]  Just go to the Listen Live section at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get that.
[00:45:48.518 --> 00:45:52.941]  And certainly tell your friends and family about that as well if you don't listen to the live streams at local AM or FM stations.
[00:45:53.281 --> 00:45:54.702]  And please keep spreading the word about the show.
[00:45:55.062 --> 00:45:57.063]  Okay Mike, how do you see this?
[00:45:57.984 --> 00:46:08.485]  Unfolding, because the public's now finding out, and is going to find out more and more over the next few months, that it was all a fraud, that it's only going to get worse, and that the Army's standing by for martial law.
[00:46:09.086 --> 00:46:09.867]  What do you see happening?
[00:46:16.669 --> 00:46:34.999]  The Federal Reserve cannot go on just printing up new money to pour onto the bankers and I know they're treating it like a loan and the expectation is we'll somehow all pay it back, but in the immediate future, this is going to trigger hyperinflation.
[00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:40.582]  We're already seeing prices start to really shoot up at the supermarket and the gas station.
[00:46:41.082 --> 00:46:44.543]  And at some point, somebody is not going to be able to pay their bills.
[00:46:44.583 --> 00:46:46.124]  We're already seeing it in California.
[00:46:46.724 --> 00:46:50.145]  We're already seeing it in several sections of the federal government.
[00:46:50.505 --> 00:46:56.727]  States are getting by right now by canceling certain programs and transferring funds and moving them around to cover the shortfall.
[00:46:57.047 --> 00:47:01.188]  But the big failing is there's no new money coming in.
[00:47:01.228 --> 00:47:03.229]  There's no real wealth coming into the system.
[00:47:03.489 --> 00:47:04.950]  We're not exporting products.
[00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.150]  In fact, our manufacturing
[00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:09.113]  It continues to just absolutely plummet right now.
[00:47:09.293 --> 00:47:31.054]  We've got nothing to sell and nobody wants to buy it from us and Hillary Clinton is running around the world right now trying to convince other countries to go on buying our debt and these other countries are starting to wonder will it ever be repaid and so at some point the whole financial system has to come crashing down and at that point we're going to see a wide diverse group
[00:47:31.734 --> 00:47:42.582]  of opportunists, carpetbaggers if you will, each of whom is going to try and create in the aftermath of the crash what they see as most advantageous to their own interests as we move forward.
[00:47:42.922 --> 00:47:56.672]  The people behind the Federal Reserve, they'll be floating their front man to try and say, yes we need a new government and it's got to be formed this way and it'll go back and forth and what we the people have to do is really think about the kind of country that we want
[00:47:57.532 --> 00:48:19.663]  to take the place of the collapsed United States of America and certainly be on our guard against those opportunists who are going to try and force something new on us in the heat and rush of the moment and that is really the biggest danger is that the American people who are so used to living with the government that they've got to have one no matter what they'll grab the first thing that's offered to them gratefully and that is the real danger right there.
[00:48:21.664 --> 00:48:23.105]  You hit the nail on the head as they say
[00:48:24.284 --> 00:48:25.665]  I mean, we know what their new plan is.
[00:48:25.905 --> 00:48:27.345]  They set this up, they implode it.
[00:48:27.385 --> 00:48:40.111]  Their new plan is a world government run by private banks that we pay carbon taxes and money transfer taxes to in the tens of trillions every year that will further strangle industry that isn't controlled by them.
[00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:42.812]  They will then selectively enforce the carbon taxes.
[00:48:42.832 --> 00:48:44.873]  They're openly saying that they're going to do that.
[00:48:44.953 --> 00:48:50.075]  We have to stop them or they're going to take a horrible situation and turn it into something far worse.
[00:48:51.724 --> 00:48:56.884]  Yeah, that's absolutely true because the one thing when you get people who are infected with the sickness of greed
[00:48:57.791 --> 00:49:05.718]  And they stop seeing their fellow human beings as fellow human beings and they become simply objects on a balance sheet to be harvested and exploited.
[00:49:06.179 --> 00:49:10.182]  There is no limit to what they will do as long as they're able to get away with it.
[00:49:10.622 --> 00:49:20.291]  Ultimately, this is why we have revolutions, because the ruling party of a given country will push the people past the point of tolerance and there's always going to be a backlash.
[00:49:20.611 --> 00:49:24.435]  And I think there's going to be one coming, I'm hoping it will be very small and minimal,
[00:49:25.215 --> 00:49:33.641]  And again, I really do think that ultimately what's going to happen is the government of the United States is simply going to collapse in on itself the way the USSR did.
[00:49:33.841 --> 00:49:39.224]  And we've got to be ready at the state level to make sure it isn't an international takeover during that revolution.
[00:49:40.025 --> 00:49:45.329]  Instead, it needs to be the American people taking the country back and reconstituting it yet again.
[00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:46.809]  Very well said, Mike Rivera.
[00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:51.533]  We always enjoy having you on once a month here with us, and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:49:52.386 --> 00:49:52.987]  Thank you very much.
[00:49:53.027 --> 00:49:53.907]  We'll talk to you in a month.
[00:49:54.328 --> 00:49:56.109]  Alright, there goes Mike Rovero.
[00:49:56.649 --> 00:50:00.513]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, and what he laid out is the facts.
[00:50:00.553 --> 00:50:02.134]  We've got Richard C. Cook straight ahead.
[00:50:02.154 --> 00:50:08.419]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:13.524 --> 00:50:15.085]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:15.205 --> 00:50:19.827]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:19.947 --> 00:50:22.708]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:22.908 --> 00:50:25.769]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:50:25.949 --> 00:50:30.671]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:50:30.911 --> 00:50:31.812]  If you simply prepare.
[00:50:32.032 --> 00:50:34.994]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:50:35.274 --> 00:50:42.180]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:51:02.696 --> 00:51:04.678]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:16.269 --> 00:51:18.190]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.551]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:28.054 --> 00:51:28.694]  Big Brother.
[00:51:29.355 --> 00:51:30.415]  Mainstream media.
[00:51:31.135 --> 00:51:32.316]  Government cover-ups.
[00:51:32.876 --> 00:51:33.716]  You want answers?
[00:51:34.457 --> 00:51:35.377]  Well, so does he.
[00:51:35.397 --> 00:51:39.659]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:40.199 --> 00:51:44.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:51:56.835 --> 00:51:59.238]  Richard C. Cook is our guest for the next hour.
[00:51:59.318 --> 00:52:01.060]  He's an economic historian.
[00:52:02.061 --> 00:52:05.845]  He has written for some of the largest publications in the country.
[00:52:07.273 --> 00:52:13.777]  He has consulted for NASA and we are really honored to have him on with us today.
[00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:23.144]  He also writes for a lot of big publications like Global Research and I wanted to get him on because we had him on two or three years ago and he predicted a lot of what is now unfolding.
[00:52:24.386 --> 00:52:31.954]  He understands from the establishment's own documents, their own admissions, that they are engineering a world economic implosion over a year ago on this show.
[00:52:32.395 --> 00:52:39.442]  He concurred with my analysis and added to it that they were going to implode the economy, then announce a new bank of the world with carbon taxes paid to them.
[00:52:41.055 --> 00:52:43.336]  So use the crisis they created to bring in even more control.
[00:52:43.676 --> 00:52:53.939]  I want him to flesh out the basic background of this and then get into what's currently happening with his prognosis of how serious things are currently and how bad they are going to get.
[00:52:53.959 --> 00:52:56.160]  And people say, well, we know how bad they are right now.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:56.660]  No, you don't.
[00:52:57.998 --> 00:53:06.065]  I know a lot of us, you know, it's hard to gauge different sectors of the economy in the U.S., worldwide, how fast this is going downhill.
[00:53:06.825 --> 00:53:10.448]  You know, it's a recession when your neighbor's out of work, it's a depression when you're out of work.
[00:53:11.029 --> 00:53:16.573]  I believe we're really officially in a depression right now, and even The Economist magazine, their economists have come out and said that.
[00:53:16.913 --> 00:53:18.535]  So Richard C. Cook, great to have you here with us.
[00:53:19.275 --> 00:53:20.396]  Thanks Alex, good to be here.
[00:53:20.917 --> 00:53:21.297]  You bet.
[00:53:22.778 --> 00:53:26.101]  You've got the floor, break down what we're facing right now, what's really happening.
[00:53:29.114 --> 00:53:33.497]  It's collapsing, and the bottom is not in sight.
[00:53:34.278 --> 00:53:38.261]  I was at a conference over the weekend in New York.
[00:53:38.361 --> 00:53:51.712]  It was the annual conference of the Eastern Economic Association, and one of the big-name economists, Paul Krugman, who's the incoming president of the Eastern Economic Association, spoke.
[00:53:52.232 --> 00:53:55.815]  He said it's of Great Depression scale right now.
[00:53:56.598 --> 00:53:58.258]  There was another speaker there.
[00:53:58.638 --> 00:53:59.419]  You may have heard of him.
[00:53:59.439 --> 00:54:00.499]  His name is Henry Liu.
[00:54:00.599 --> 00:54:07.061]  He's the publisher of Asia Times, and he looks at it from the perspective of China and the Asian economies.
[00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:10.301]  He came up with an interesting statistic.
[00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:19.804]  Two years ago, the total valuation of all of the assets in the world was approximately $60 trillion.
[00:54:21.044 --> 00:54:24.665]  Today, two years later, it's approximately $30 trillion.
[00:54:26.343 --> 00:54:34.505]  So, half the value of the entire world economy has disappeared in two years, and it's still going down.
[00:54:35.425 --> 00:54:37.486]  The bottom has not yet been seen.
[00:54:37.966 --> 00:54:51.910]  Now, to me, one of the most interesting facts about this is that if you really think about it, the ability of the producing economy of the world to produce goods and services has not changed.
[00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:52.970]  It has not decreased.
[00:54:53.996 --> 00:55:05.803]  The ability of the world economy to produce constantly increases because of technology, because of the growth of knowledge, because of the growth of efficiency, and as we've seen in the U.S.
[00:55:05.843 --> 00:55:11.586]  from the productivity data, the growth of productivity of the economy.
[00:55:12.086 --> 00:55:21.712]  Even though people's wages are stagnant, even though people's portfolios are collapsing, the stock market is collapsing, the derivative market is collapsing, every market is collapsing,
[00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:27.645]  And yet the producing economy continues to grow, so why is there this contradiction?
[00:55:27.665 --> 00:55:31.686]  That's what nobody has figured out, and that's where we really have to focus.
[00:55:32.286 --> 00:55:38.448]  Well, we know, and we'll come back and talk about this, the parasitic banking economy has now become about 30% of the real economy.
[00:55:38.888 --> 00:55:40.628]  They've created Ponzi schemes.
[00:55:41.608 --> 00:55:45.109]  Many economists say over a thousand trillion or one quadrillion.
[00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:47.890]  They've created this tsunami of fiat currency.
[00:55:49.386 --> 00:55:55.731]  And so they want to implode the world economy so they can consolidate it all.
[00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:59.735]  This is a financial coup d'etat against the planet.
[00:56:00.195 --> 00:56:05.219]  We'll get Richard C. Cook's take on that on the other side of this quick break.
[00:56:05.499 --> 00:56:09.543]  For the rest of the hour and later in the hour, I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:56:10.393 --> 00:56:17.215]  But specifically on the economy, specifically how it's affecting you, are questions for Richard C. Cook at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:56:17.235 --> 00:56:22.537]  If it isn't on that, I'm going to hang up on you.
[00:56:23.817 --> 00:56:24.998]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:56:25.198 --> 00:56:27.459]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:31.600]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:34.821]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFood.
[00:56:39.656 --> 00:56:47.698]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:56:47.898 --> 00:56:54.039]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:56:54.279 --> 00:56:57.680]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:02.021]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:57:09.952 --> 00:57:11.132]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:57:11.172 --> 00:57:14.053]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:57:14.073 --> 00:57:16.054]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:57:16.094 --> 00:57:18.934]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:57:18.954 --> 00:57:20.195]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[00:57:36.784 --> 00:57:37.504]  We're good to go.
[00:57:56.892 --> 00:57:59.513]  Directly to your computer or iPhone and share it with others.
[00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:05.715]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:58:05.875 --> 00:58:10.397]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.

[00:58:41.528 --> 00:58:42.809]  We're good to go!
[00:59:11.028 --> 00:59:14.850]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.452]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[00:59:17.632 --> 00:59:22.654]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:59:24.796 --> 00:59:30.819]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:59:31.419 --> 00:59:34.401]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:36.656 --> 00:59:51.066]  The establishment is betting everything they've got on Obama and his hype machine to con the public to stand down long enough, worldwide, so they can get their New World Order banking system, Bank of the World, as Time Magazine Newsweek called it, set up.
[00:59:51.146 --> 00:59:54.408]  It'll, quote, knock the heads of bad countries, including the United States.
[00:59:54.428 --> 00:59:55.289]  That's another quote.
[00:59:55.809 --> 00:59:58.931]  That's why it's so important for everybody to get the Obama deception.
[00:59:58.951 --> 01:00:01.953]  It'll be out in about 12 days on the 15th.
[01:00:03.214 --> 01:00:07.116]  TheObamaDeception.net or ObamaDeception.net without the the will get you there.
[01:00:07.176 --> 01:00:08.277]  Go to Infowars.com.
[01:00:08.337 --> 01:00:13.260]  Pre-order the film now because they will ship out in the order they are received.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.782]  We've gotten so many orders, it'll take a few days to ship them out.
[01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:32.372]  So I want everybody to get The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com because if we show people how the shadow government's in control, how the central banks are in control, how Obama's a front man, after they're done with him, they're going to blame it all on him like they did Bush when they're just puppets.
[01:00:32.992 --> 01:00:35.374]  And they are going to bring in the world government.
[01:00:35.394 --> 01:00:37.215]  So please get the Obama Deception today.
[01:00:37.235 --> 01:00:39.036]  You can also call toll free to order it.
[01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:39.096]  888-253-3139.
[01:00:39.116 --> 01:00:39.156]  888-253-3139.
[01:00:47.051 --> 01:00:54.457]  A sponsor that makes this show possible and also gets you to be self-sufficient is survivalseedbank.com.
[01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.680]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:03.645]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:01:04.045 --> 01:01:09.446]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds have the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:01:09.846 --> 01:01:15.327]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[01:01:15.747 --> 01:01:17.787]  Governments are hoarding seeds at giant U.N.
[01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:19.348]  seed banks all over the planet.
[01:01:19.368 --> 01:01:20.688]  They're buying up the heirloom seeds.
[01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:25.229]  But Survivalist Seed Bank has some of the best quality at the best prices out there available.
[01:01:25.529 --> 01:01:27.629]  Survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:01:27.649 --> 01:01:27.689]  877-327-0365.
[01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:36.892]  Well, let me plug my website first, www.richardccook.com.
[01:01:36.973 --> 01:01:38.794]  I've got a couple new articles up there.
[01:02:01.321 --> 01:02:09.764]  Just this past week, one I call the Last Picture Show, which is the name I use for the new Obama administration budget.
[01:02:10.184 --> 01:02:21.088]  But basically, what we have seen is a complete collapse in the value, the nominal value, the paper value, if you will, of all world assets.
[01:02:21.908 --> 01:02:28.170]  I mentioned that I was at a conference of the Eastern Economic Association over the weekend, and the figure was put out there
[01:02:29.028 --> 01:02:41.712]  The two years ago, the total valuation of all of the assets in the world, this is everything, everything of tangible value, the price on it at that time was $60 trillion approximately.
[01:02:42.512 --> 01:02:49.754]  Today, the total is under $30 trillion and falling in the bottom has not been seen yet.
[01:02:50.395 --> 01:02:55.176]  So what we're seeing is not the disappearance of things of value.
[01:02:55.919 --> 01:03:03.325]  We're not seeing the disappearance of the ability of the producing economy to produce goods and services.
[01:03:03.365 --> 01:03:05.767]  What we're seeing is a collapse of the price system.
[01:03:06.207 --> 01:03:19.899]  We're seeing a deflation of a bubble, a series of bubbles that has been constructed by the world banking system really over the last, well it goes back 30, 40 years in its entire history.
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.882]  Even further if you want to look at the start of the Federal Reserve System.
[01:03:24.477 --> 01:03:40.684]  But it's been in the last 10 years when the bubbles have really just gotten totally out of control, and it's been the banking system with the Federal Reserve every step of the way enabling this to create this enormous bubble that's now collapsed.
[01:03:41.264 --> 01:03:53.449]  So again, it's not the ability of the world economy to produce what we need to live, it's the financial aspects of it, the bubble aspects of it that we're seeing collapse, and it's still on its way down.
[01:03:54.071 --> 01:04:15.816]  And as you say, we've got talk about the world financial organizations, the big ones, particularly the ones in Europe, ready to step in now and put together a world financial order that is going to take control of all the economies of the world through the international banking system.
[01:04:15.856 --> 01:04:17.416]  So all of that is going on right now.
[01:04:18.663 --> 01:04:20.084]  Let me just read your bio to folks.
[01:04:20.144 --> 01:04:21.025]  I forgot to do that earlier.
[01:04:21.065 --> 01:04:22.386]  Richard C. Cook is a former U.S.
[01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:23.386]  Federal Government analyst.
[01:04:23.727 --> 01:04:25.108]  His career included service with the U.S.
[01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:29.931]  Civil Service Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the Carter White House, and NASA, and the U.S.
[01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:30.692]  Treasury Department.
[01:04:31.512 --> 01:04:36.056]  His articles on economics, politics, and space policy have appeared on numerous websites.
[01:04:36.616 --> 01:04:41.320]  His book, The Monetary Reform, entitled We Hold These Truths, The Promise of Monetary Reform,
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.500]  He is in preparation.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:50.582]  He is the author of Challenger Revealed, an insider account of how the Reagan administration caused the greatest tragedy of the space age.
[01:04:51.102 --> 01:04:54.523]  Called by one writer, the most important space flight book of the last 20 years.
[01:04:54.563 --> 01:04:56.984]  His website is richardccook.com.
[01:04:57.824 --> 01:05:07.307]  Richard, specifically though, if you have private banks engineering the collapse so they can consolidate things, and from past interviews I know you agree with that,
[01:05:10.378 --> 01:05:23.928]  We need to then expose the fact that they are not just criminals creating Ponzi schemes through governments and private means, but that they need to be arrested, not now pose as the world's saviors.
[01:05:24.729 --> 01:05:25.809]  And we've seen them
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:30.405]  With the banker bailout of October 3rd, saying we're going to have a depression if you don't do this.
[01:05:30.725 --> 01:05:32.768]  Then withholding the money for the subprime mortgages.
[01:05:33.148 --> 01:05:34.691]  Then saying we won't say where it was spent.
[01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:37.334]  Bloomberg reporting 9.7 trillion taken.
[01:05:37.755 --> 01:05:40.578]  As you just said, that's a third of all the world's real assets.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.861]  Well, that's how the banking system traditionally has worked.
[01:06:11.956 --> 01:06:20.521]  If you go back in history and you see the history of the panics that occurred leading up to the Federal Reserve System, that's what the banks did.
[01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:28.946]  They would call in their loans, it would collapse the currency, collapse the economy, and then they would step in to buy assets for pennies on the dollar.
[01:06:29.766 --> 01:06:32.187]  Exactly the same thing happened with the Great Depression.
[01:06:32.928 --> 01:06:35.069]  The Great Depression was an engineered event.
[01:06:35.169 --> 01:06:37.150]  It was not something that just happened.
[01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:39.471]  The banks built the bubbles of the 1920s.
[01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:52.367]  And then, when the bubbles were fully ripe, they stepped in and they pulled back on the margin lending requirements and collapsed the economy at that time.
[01:06:52.427 --> 01:06:57.688]  And then they stepped in and made huge fortunes by buying everything they could in the 1930s.
[01:06:57.768 --> 01:06:59.328]  We're now seeing the same thing.
[01:06:59.568 --> 01:07:07.630]  In fact, when I started writing about this two years ago, the first article in the series I wrote came out in June.
[01:07:08.436 --> 01:07:13.899]  Of 2007, and the title was, it's official, the collapse of the U.S.
[01:07:13.959 --> 01:07:15.040]  economy has begun.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:32.929]  Because I saw at that time what they were saying about the extraordinary debt levels compared to equity in businesses was a disaster waiting to happen, and then you had the Federal Reserve deliberately ratcheting down the interest rates that it had raised only two years previously to create the housing bubble.
[01:07:33.587 --> 01:07:38.669]  Now they stepped in and they destroyed the housing bubble by their interest rate policies.
[01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:49.214]  And I quoted at that time the CEO of Carlisle, the equity firm that the Bush family was so closely involved with.
[01:07:49.955 --> 01:07:54.537]  And what he was saying was he was sending out a notice to all of his branches.
[01:07:55.217 --> 01:08:02.841]  And he was saying, keep your eyes open because what we're going to have after this thing collapses is the buying opportunity of a generation.
[01:08:03.737 --> 01:08:06.398]  Because everything is going to be dirt cheap.
[01:08:06.879 --> 01:08:13.702]  So, you know, the government says, well, we've got to support the collapse of housing prices, for example.
[01:08:14.322 --> 01:08:19.325]  And yet it's these pricing collapses that makes everything ripe for the big banks to pick up.
[01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:20.869]  I think so.
[01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:40.815]  That's correct, and I'm working on this video that I'm going to make later on this month where I go back in American history
[01:09:04.238 --> 01:09:20.644]  And if you go back, say, to Thomas Jefferson, for example, or James Madison, early presidents who understood the banking system, what they warn about is the ability of the banks to produce inflation followed by deflation.
[01:09:21.284 --> 01:09:30.588]  Because with inflation, they make tremendous profits because of the interest rates and the compound interest they charge on the inflating economy.
[01:09:31.195 --> 01:09:39.843]  Then when the inflation has gone as far as it can go, they pull back credit, they constrict credit, and that causes a crash of prices.
[01:09:39.883 --> 01:09:41.404]  That causes a deflation.
[01:09:42.005 --> 01:09:54.416]  When the deflation occurs, they're able then to step in and buy up assets very cheaply, and we are seeing now the biggest deflation in world history, at least as far as we can detect.
[01:09:54.790 --> 01:10:10.101]  When we come back, I'll pull up the famous Thomas Jefferson quote, but they're all similar, about if we ever allow private banks to take control of the money power, first through inflation, then through deflation, they will completely enslave everybody, and we will wake up slaves on the continent our forebears conquered.
[01:10:10.121 --> 01:10:13.924]  You know, that's basically a paraphrase, because they've done this in Europe over and over again.
[01:10:13.944 --> 01:10:15.525]  They were trying to set that up here.
[01:10:16.285 --> 01:10:19.128]  The word Jefferson uses is very instructive.
[01:10:19.168 --> 01:10:20.929]  He says, we will wake up homeless.
[01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:24.192]  On the continent, our fathers conquered homeless.
[01:10:24.212 --> 01:10:26.294]  He was talking about the housing bubble, wasn't he?
[01:10:27.575 --> 01:10:29.096]  Because this is how they ruled Europe.
[01:10:29.136 --> 01:10:35.141]  I mean, the Rothschilds in 1815 went in and panicked them, saying Napoleon had won and bought it all up as well.
[01:10:35.161 --> 01:10:36.262]  I mean, it's just, it's constant.
[01:10:36.883 --> 01:10:43.789]  Yeah, it was their goal, and this was even put out in writing by the American Bankers Association somewhere in the late 1800s.
[01:10:43.949 --> 01:10:49.774]  The goal is to reduce the American population to renters.
[01:10:50.704 --> 01:10:59.090]  They recognize that people who own their homes are people who have some pride, who have assets of their own, who have independence.
[01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:05.013]  So take away their homes, their property, and leave them so poor they can only rent.
[01:11:05.474 --> 01:11:07.175]  Then you can control the population.
[01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:09.037]  Richard C. Cook.
[01:11:09.158 --> 01:11:10.378]  Powerful information.
[01:11:10.418 --> 01:11:12.359]  And he's 100% on target.
[01:11:12.399 --> 01:11:13.540]  RichardCCook.com.
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.942]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.TV and InfoWars.com.
[01:11:17.242 --> 01:11:18.863]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:11:19.523 --> 01:11:20.704]  We'll talk about how we defeat them.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.045]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:11:27.205 --> 01:11:31.291]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:11:31.471 --> 01:11:39.442]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[01:11:39.702 --> 01:11:42.883]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions.
[01:11:43.104 --> 01:11:48.986]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:11:49.246 --> 01:11:53.628]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:11:53.908 --> 01:12:01.912]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:12:02.112 --> 01:12:09.275]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom
[01:12:12.965 --> 01:12:23.010]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver dot com or call 888-213-4338 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[01:12:23.571 --> 01:12:29.994]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:12:30.354 --> 01:12:32.035]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:34.011]  But who is the enemy?
[01:12:34.532 --> 01:12:35.032]  Bin Laden.
[01:12:35.312 --> 01:12:36.313]  This is his M.O.
[01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:37.675]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:12:37.715 --> 01:12:39.396]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:12:39.677 --> 01:12:46.443]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:12:46.844 --> 01:12:47.284]  Some U.S.
[01:12:47.324 --> 01:12:53.010]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:57.193]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:12:57.473 --> 01:13:00.155]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:13:24.198 --> 01:13:28.481]  Hello, this is Peter Kranschnabel from Midas Resources and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[01:13:28.781 --> 01:13:40.710]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous free fall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[01:13:41.131 --> 01:13:46.154]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[01:13:46.715 --> 01:13:48.156]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[01:13:48.695 --> 01:13:54.720]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:59.143]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[01:13:59.684 --> 01:14:00.424]  Give me a call.
[01:14:00.484 --> 01:14:03.907]  I'm Peter Kronschnobloid, 800-686-2237, extension 108, and allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[01:14:09.218 --> 01:14:11.099]  That's Peter Kranschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:14:11.139 --> 01:14:15.241]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, where you can still purchase gold with paper.
[01:14:23.237 --> 01:14:28.400]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin cream's personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:37.626]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[01:14:37.866 --> 01:14:41.248]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[01:14:41.288 --> 01:14:41.648]  I think so.
[01:15:03.224 --> 01:15:03.985]  We're good to go.
[01:15:33.626 --> 01:15:35.307]  The days are loaded.
[01:15:35.327 --> 01:15:40.129]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:15:40.889 --> 01:15:44.751]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:48.933]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[01:15:57.236 --> 01:15:58.497]  We are back live.
[01:15:58.557 --> 01:16:01.438]  Here is a quote by U.S.
[01:16:01.478 --> 01:16:04.860]  Founding Father, drafted the Declaration of Independence, third U.S.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:11.503]  President, in 1802, in a letter to then Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.483]  He said, we've got it up on screen right now for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:16:17.523 --> 01:16:21.846]  By the way, this quote is in the Obama Deception, to give you an idea of the type of things this film covers.
[01:16:22.206 --> 01:16:39.319]  If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their money, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of their property until the children wake up, until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.
[01:16:40.461 --> 01:16:40.961]  Homeless.
[01:16:41.621 --> 01:16:53.545]  This has been done over and over again, and for maybe 50 years, 60 years maximum, the founders, and then Andrew Jackson, the fruit of the founders, he fought the Revolutionary War when he was 12 and 13.
[01:16:54.385 --> 01:16:58.466]  They knew the game plan, and on his deathbed, Andrew Jackson said, what are you most proud of?
[01:16:58.506 --> 01:16:59.627]  He said, I killed the bank.
[01:16:59.887 --> 01:17:01.427]  You should read his final address.
[01:17:03.808 --> 01:17:07.029]  That half a century of somewhat economic freedom
[01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:09.497]  Made us what we are today.
[01:17:10.357 --> 01:17:11.818]  That's what allowed us to grow.
[01:17:11.858 --> 01:17:15.480]  And the foreign banks wrote in the Times of London, we can't allow what's happening in America.
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:17.441]  The world's figuring out the scam we run.
[01:17:18.381 --> 01:17:19.402]  We've got to shut them down.
[01:17:19.422 --> 01:17:21.082]  And they tried to kill Andrew Jackson and others.
[01:17:21.383 --> 01:17:26.245]  Going back to Richard C. Cook, any comments on that quote I was just covering?
[01:17:26.305 --> 01:17:37.871]  And then, now that we know they're doing this, from studying the architecture of the world banking system they're setting up, what is this thing going to look like if they succeed with the carbon taxes and all the controls, versus how do we defeat them?
[01:17:38.976 --> 01:17:41.238]  Well, those are great quotes.
[01:17:41.358 --> 01:18:07.735]  I include those in this new video that I'm making, and it goes all the way up to the Civil War, because the financiers of Europe, and it's been well documented by people who know who were there at the time, their objective was to break up the United States, because the United States, a democracy where the people control their own currency, thanks to people like Andrew Jackson, was the biggest threat on the Earth to the monarchies of Europe and to the financial
[01:18:08.656 --> 01:18:12.237]  Uh, rule of the Rothschilds and the other big banking families.
[01:18:12.297 --> 01:18:22.360]  So when, uh, the civil war began and Abraham Lincoln went to the New York banks, they wanted to charge him interest rates anywhere from 25 to 35%.
[01:18:23.801 --> 01:18:25.341]  And Lincoln said, forget that.
[01:18:25.361 --> 01:18:34.064]  And that's why he introduced the greenbacks where the government had the ability, he knew it, uh, to just spend money directly into circulation.
[01:18:34.778 --> 01:18:39.962]  For the items they needed to purchase to prosecute the war without going through the banks.
[01:18:40.622 --> 01:18:48.968]  The Civil War financially was a miracle, because we fought a war without any debt to the banks whatsoever.
[01:18:49.749 --> 01:18:57.634]  We had the greenbacks, we sold war bonds directly to the people, and we raised excise taxes and introduced a small income tax.
[01:18:58.215 --> 01:19:03.819]  But the miracle was, the Union was preserved without debt to the banks, and the European banks hated it.
[01:19:04.386 --> 01:19:11.251]  The London Times hated it, but I'm looking at a website here that has the stock market activity for today.
[01:19:11.271 --> 01:19:16.015]  There's a really interesting number here, Alex, that illustrates what we're talking about.
[01:19:16.055 --> 01:19:22.280]  You know, Citibank, from the 11th of February to the 20th of February, went down 42%, right?
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:26.783]  The stock just plummeted, and so everybody says, oh, that's terrible.
[01:19:26.823 --> 01:19:28.244]  Citibank's in such bad shape.
[01:19:28.925 --> 01:19:31.507]  Well, today, Citibank stock
[01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:39.471]  Has been sold in the amount of 360 million shares at a very low price.
[01:19:39.491 --> 01:19:40.571]  So what does that mean?
[01:19:40.751 --> 01:19:52.213]  That means that the people with the money have come back into the market now and they're buying Citibank shares for half of what it sold for three weeks ago.
[01:19:52.494 --> 01:19:54.294]  They're getting the people out of the ownership.
[01:19:54.314 --> 01:19:55.354]  This is vertical integration.
[01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:01.772]  That's right.
[01:20:01.872 --> 01:20:05.596]  They've driven the small stockholders, the mutual funds, they've driven them out.
[01:20:06.256 --> 01:20:11.282]  And now the people with the money have come back in to buy that enormous financial institution.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:15.724]  For pennies on the dollar, there couldn't be a better illustration of what is going on.
[01:20:15.804 --> 01:20:27.975]  So they took the pension funds money, the government employee money, the private pension fund money, the mom and pop stock market money, they weren't about to let the baby boomers have this, notice right as they're retiring they did this, and they bragged they're doing it.
[01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:35.983]  They destroy confidence, drive it all down, engorge themselves with cash, while the stock itself's down, then go in and buy it up themselves.
[01:20:36.601 --> 01:20:44.074]  Yeah, that's what's happened with Citibank, and we're seeing similar things happening today with Bank of America and American Express.
[01:20:44.114 --> 01:20:45.777]  They're doing the same thing with those two.
[01:20:47.068 --> 01:20:55.212]  I want to hear from you what you think the winner banks, the banks that are going to leave standing, who those will be versus what front corporations like Enron and Tool Co.
[01:20:55.792 --> 01:21:03.056]  and Global Crossing, because we know about these front companies, fence the money out offshore and then implode them to rip off the shareholders and employees.
[01:21:03.416 --> 01:21:04.597]  But now this is on a wider scale.
[01:21:04.637 --> 01:21:06.798]  Where you see that going and solutions to this.
[01:21:06.878 --> 01:21:09.159]  Richard C. Cook and your phone call straight ahead.
[01:21:09.179 --> 01:21:09.659]  Stay with us.
[01:21:13.701 --> 01:21:14.602]  We're on the march.
[01:21:15.102 --> 01:21:16.603]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:17.616 --> 01:21:20.288]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:23.658 --> 01:21:25.079]  So you want to stop smoking.
[01:21:25.139 --> 01:21:26.239]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:29.161]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:33.123]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[01:21:33.283 --> 01:21:36.825]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[01:21:37.045 --> 01:21:39.006]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[01:21:39.046 --> 01:21:43.009]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[01:21:43.369 --> 01:21:46.150]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system.

[01:22:23.783 --> 01:22:29.244]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:22:29.504 --> 01:22:30.805]  And we knew what to do.
[01:22:30.825 --> 01:22:32.585]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:22:32.825 --> 01:22:39.247]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:22:39.847 --> 01:22:41.888]  Whitman, EPA Director,
[01:22:43.553 --> 01:22:48.362]  On the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:55.560]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:58.902]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:22:59.022 --> 01:23:04.286]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:23:04.787 --> 01:23:07.429]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:24:14.472 --> 01:24:15.393]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:24:15.413 --> 01:24:17.114]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:36.368 --> 01:24:47.451]  Coming up in just a few minutes, we're going to be taking your calls with Richard C. Cook, economic historian, government analyst, former government analyst for the White House, author.
[01:24:51.812 --> 01:24:59.774]  But I wanted to go back to you, sir, and again, specifically, because we're out of time in the last segment,
[01:25:01.505 --> 01:25:05.228]  Well, the plan is to allow the bubble to collapse.
[01:25:05.248 --> 01:25:11.472]  This is what has been called, and you're probably familiar with the term, listeners are probably familiar with the term, the soft landing.
[01:25:26.843 --> 01:25:31.925]  That's to allow the bubble to collapse without taking down the entire system with it.
[01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:35.627]  It does take down a lot of small financial institutions.
[01:25:35.667 --> 01:25:36.907]  You know, it took down Lehman.
[01:25:36.947 --> 01:25:41.169]  It took down Merrill Lynch, which was sold to Bank of America.
[01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:55.855]  So they're letting the small fish collapse while the big ones come in and eat up everything in sight and consolidate their control, which is why the big four, Citibank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo,
[01:25:56.491 --> 01:26:06.619]  And JP Morgan Chase are all going to come through this because they're going to be the ones who are the recipients of the additional bailout monies that are going to be coming through the Obama budget for 2009-2010.
[01:26:07.339 --> 01:26:11.122]  The budget that was just announced the other day.
[01:26:11.662 --> 01:26:17.827]  Then, meanwhile, the producing economy, the economy where we live and work, we're going to see depression level unemployment.
[01:26:18.468 --> 01:26:20.409]  We're going to see cuts in social services.
[01:26:20.449 --> 01:26:22.571]  We're going to see Social Security cut back.
[01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:24.152]  We're going to see Medicare cut back.
[01:26:25.255 --> 01:26:29.436]  All of those benefit programs are going to be sacrificed to a significant extent.
[01:26:29.976 --> 01:26:36.978]  We're already seeing not just the standard of living in the United States collapsing, but also the life expectancy.
[01:26:37.738 --> 01:26:49.641]  All of this stuff is going to lead to a depressed economy, which is going to be at levels of maybe a half or less, 40% of economic activity that we've seen.
[01:26:50.293 --> 01:27:05.999]  In the last decade, and then the banks will just start rebuilding it through more lending, but at a much lower price level, a much lower level of economic activity, and the whole cycle just starts all over again, but this time with greater control and greater consolidation.
[01:27:06.099 --> 01:27:18.764]  Now, of course, we do know that they're calling up the police powers of the state, the military powers, to everybody's warning, all of the intelligence people are saying, well, we're going to have riots, we're going to have
[01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:22.311]  Civil unrest, so they're preparing for that.
[01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:40.158]  But one interesting thing about that, Alex, if you read about the history of the late 1800s, when we had the Greenback Party, the Populist Party, the People's Party, all trying to fight against the monetary system in the late 1800s, the monetary power was calling for the same thing.
[01:27:40.678 --> 01:27:46.680]  They wanted the government to step in, they were calling for stocking the armories in the big American cities,
[01:27:47.150 --> 01:28:03.930]  Because they were doing the same thing then as they were doing now, gaining financial control through a big, big deflation, and then calling for the police power of the state to come in and protect the bankers, protect the financiers from the people.
[01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:06.754]  So it's just a repetition of history, except today.
[01:28:07.758 --> 01:28:08.719]  I don't
[01:28:26.707 --> 01:28:31.270]  You know, only half of those, or total 5% of the population, is self-sufficient.
[01:28:31.290 --> 01:28:32.691]  So they've got us right where they want us.
[01:28:32.971 --> 01:28:41.637]  And towards the premeditation of all of this, just adding to what you were saying, not only do they start imploding the economy in the name of pumping it back up, which they have no intention of doing,
[01:28:42.137 --> 01:28:47.698]  While they badmouth it, claiming they're trying to pump it up, they're pumping all the cash into themselves to be cash rich.
[01:28:47.758 --> 01:28:54.659]  And to show the premeditation of this, they've been gearing up this police state for decades for just this time we're now entering.
[01:28:54.899 --> 01:29:03.761]  They didn't just suddenly build FEMA camps and get Brigade Homeland and Homeland Security and build this apparatus to fight Al-Qaeda, which they now admit is for the American people.
[01:29:03.801 --> 01:29:08.002]  Can you speak to that and then get into some brief solutions, because I want to go to calls.
[01:29:08.857 --> 01:29:10.238]  Well, that is correct.
[01:29:10.938 --> 01:29:15.020]  Now, the Obama administration is trying to cover both ends of the spectrum.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:29.748]  They're pumping up the financial bubble to try to keep the big banks in business, and at the same time, they're extending the federal deficit by putting in place additions to welfare-type programs.
[01:29:29.849 --> 01:29:32.710]  Plus, they're going to have a big hiring spree to hire 1 to 250,000
[01:29:34.898 --> 01:29:38.520]  New Federal Employees, which is a Keynesian job creation program.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:48.266]  So they're trying to cover the whole spectrum, which is why they have the $1.75 trillion budget deficit projected for this year, which is producing a new bubble.
[01:29:48.306 --> 01:29:50.127]  There's a new bubble that has just begun.
[01:29:50.147 --> 01:29:52.768]  I don't know if listeners have heard of it.
[01:29:52.828 --> 01:29:56.770]  It's the Treasury bond bubble that is just off the charts now.
[01:29:56.831 --> 01:30:03.895]  But the problem is that the Treasury bonds are paying such low interest rates that with inflation, it's a losing proposition if you buy them.
[01:30:05.086 --> 01:30:11.571]  Place that all of these stockholders who are getting out of their 401ks, abandoning the stock market, are being forced into.
[01:30:11.611 --> 01:30:20.378]  They're being forced into treasury bonds to float that bubble to pay for the $1.75 trillion budget deficit that's out there now for fiscal year 2009.
[01:30:20.918 --> 01:30:25.922]  Now, solutions to this, there is a monetary reform solution.
[01:30:25.942 --> 01:30:33.708]  I mean, there is a monetary reform movement that has been saying over and over again to people in recent years,
[01:30:34.452 --> 01:30:50.478]  All of this goes back to one factor and one factor alone, and that is that the only way money comes into existence in the economic system that we have today, run by the Federal Reserve, is through a bank loan.
[01:30:50.498 --> 01:30:52.679]  A debt creation, a debt instrument.
[01:30:52.699 --> 01:30:53.859]  A monetary system.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:31:02.943]  As long as we continue to have a debt-based monetary system, the banks will be in control, and they will inflate it and deflate it,
[01:31:03.831 --> 01:31:05.073]  Uh, to their heart's content.
[01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:06.777]  That's what has to be changed.
[01:31:13.131 --> 01:31:14.872]  Put the cherry on top of all of this.
[01:31:15.373 --> 01:31:29.705]  We're hearing about nationalization, but what really is happening, the private Federal Reserve masquerading as public, is taking control of some of its subsidiary banks that were already the private arm of the Federal Reserve.
[01:31:29.745 --> 01:31:30.846]  So it's a bait and switch.
[01:31:30.906 --> 01:31:38.352]  It's really a hijacking or a piratical takeover by multinational offshore banks of the governmental functions
[01:31:39.413 --> 01:31:48.116]  There's no real nationalization.
[01:31:48.176 --> 01:31:55.318]  What masquerades as nationalization is simply pumping more federal dollars onto the asset sheets of these banks by taking off
[01:31:56.156 --> 01:32:00.257]  of their balance sheets, the toxic debt, the bad loans, the loans that will never be repaid.
[01:32:00.777 --> 01:32:03.478]  The government does not have any kind of controlling interest.
[01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:07.479]  The government does not influence the lending policies, interest rates, or anything.
[01:32:07.499 --> 01:32:08.639]  It's just another bailout.
[01:32:08.939 --> 01:32:25.283]  So instead we need true nationalization of the private metal reserve, lock up these guys for criminal activity and Ponzi schemes, they've all openly broken even their own federal laws, and then do what the founding fathers and Andrew Jackson and President Lincoln did, and that is have a true
[01:32:25.803 --> 01:32:40.572]  Nationalize true private Bank of the United States and then educate the public about monetary systems and have a stable money supply that's meant to build up our economy, build up small businesses, build up state sovereignty and we would again be the powerhouse of the planet.
[01:32:41.273 --> 01:32:54.061]  That's correct and we need to issue what I call a dividend directly to the people like the Alaska Permanent Fund for example that distributes over $3,000 in asset wealth every year to every resident of the state.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:33:10.082]  We should do that, and in addition to that, we must write off trillions of dollars in debt that our population has been unfairly subjected to by the banking system, such as the enormous amount of credit card debt now
[01:33:10.686 --> 01:33:12.866]  That is at very high interest rates.
[01:33:12.886 --> 01:33:14.447]  The college debt, all of those.
[01:33:14.467 --> 01:33:15.527]  It all has to be written off.
[01:33:15.927 --> 01:33:19.708]  Yes, and I keep interrupting because we're short on time and this is such powerful info.
[01:33:19.728 --> 01:33:21.348]  We've got to have you back very soon, Richard C. Cook.
[01:33:21.828 --> 01:33:32.291]  It's just so incredible to know that we have this engine of true, you know, currency controlled by the government, what our founders set up, what made us the most powerful and wealthy in the world.
[01:33:32.351 --> 01:33:38.072]  Instead, we have a bunch of criminal bankers that create a black hole of debt-based money supply
[01:33:38.832 --> 01:33:43.674]  And, I mean, we have to educate the public about this if we're going to survive and thrive as a society.
[01:33:43.694 --> 01:33:46.054]  The alternative... That's the solution.
[01:33:46.515 --> 01:33:51.016]  The alternative is a world government run by the bankers, literally taxing the carbon cycle.
[01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:51.976]  Yes.
[01:33:53.037 --> 01:33:53.377]  That's right.
[01:33:53.417 --> 01:33:54.277]  That's the solution.
[01:33:54.677 --> 01:33:56.238]  This is where the battle line is drawn.
[01:33:56.918 --> 01:34:02.180]  And, again, people in this country have known this as long as we've had a country.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.780]  And the fight has gone back and forth.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.981]  In the last 70 years, the financiers
[01:34:06.488 --> 01:34:08.492]  ...have controlled it all through the Federal Reserve.
[01:34:08.572 --> 01:34:11.378]  Now that it's collapsing, we have to take advantage of this.
[01:34:12.034 --> 01:34:16.115]  And educate people about the real solutions that we have available to us.
[01:34:16.395 --> 01:34:22.196]  And by the way, the establishment openly says this is their opportunity to finish the New World Order or they'll be defeated.
[01:34:22.336 --> 01:34:22.756]  They know.
[01:34:22.836 --> 01:34:23.417]  They're moving.
[01:34:23.437 --> 01:34:25.037]  They're working overdrive, folks.
[01:34:25.757 --> 01:34:29.298]  But we have history, common sense, the law on our side.
[01:34:29.338 --> 01:34:30.718]  You better get working.
[01:34:30.738 --> 01:34:32.979]  And that's why the Obama deception coming out is so important.
[01:34:33.279 --> 01:34:34.839]  I can't wait till your video comes out.
[01:34:34.879 --> 01:34:36.360]  We certainly want to have you on to promote that.
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:46.083]  Free Minds Think Alike, he's making a film about basically the same issues, because it's the reality, and if we don't get this message out, it's over.
[01:34:46.423 --> 01:34:48.724]  Let's take a call here from Jay in New York.
[01:34:48.904 --> 01:34:49.584]  Jay, go ahead.
[01:34:51.145 --> 01:34:51.445]  Hello.
[01:34:51.705 --> 01:34:52.305]  Hey, Richard.
[01:34:53.185 --> 01:34:54.326]  Thanks a lot for the work you're doing.
[01:34:54.366 --> 01:34:54.826]  Can you hear me?
[01:34:55.146 --> 01:34:57.547]  Yeah, you sound like you're on a speakerphone, but go ahead with your question.
[01:34:58.007 --> 01:34:59.167]  Okay, yeah.
[01:34:59.888 --> 01:35:05.930]  Okay, I come from a very supposedly alternative, they call it the most enlightened city in America.
[01:35:07.506 --> 01:35:12.449]  And they're not really there, but they do have their own money system.
[01:35:12.569 --> 01:35:13.509]  Sir, let me ask you a question.
[01:35:13.749 --> 01:35:14.990]  Can you pick up a regular phone?
[01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:15.951]  Because we'd like to hear you.
[01:35:16.851 --> 01:35:18.332]  Yeah, let me just pick someone up.
[01:35:18.472 --> 01:35:21.734]  I mean, we respect you enough to want to actually be able to understand what you're saying.
[01:35:22.134 --> 01:35:23.514]  And speaker phones just don't cut it.
[01:35:23.835 --> 01:35:24.835]  I gotcha.
[01:35:25.736 --> 01:35:28.877]  I come from this city, and they have their own money system.
[01:35:28.897 --> 01:35:31.739]  It's called the, if I can say the name, the Ithaca Dollar.
[01:35:32.699 --> 01:35:35.861]  It's called the Ithaca Hour, and it's basically a work-based
[01:35:36.677 --> 01:35:39.318]  It's worth $10, one Ithaca Hour.
[01:35:39.338 --> 01:35:42.498]  You can go in someone's kitchen and wash their dishes.
[01:35:43.538 --> 01:35:44.158]  I'm a tradesman.
[01:35:44.318 --> 01:35:44.778]  I have a trade.
[01:35:44.798 --> 01:35:46.359]  I have a lot of trades.
[01:35:46.899 --> 01:35:52.140]  I'm not going to hurt, I don't think, any more than probably, you know, the rest of the country.
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:56.280]  I'm not going to leave the country because I'd be leaving behind a lot of people that I care about.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:59.181]  So we're all going to go through this together, whatever we're going to go through.
[01:35:59.641 --> 01:36:02.661]  But I'm wondering what you all think about that money system.
[01:36:02.681 --> 01:36:05.042]  Because here in Ithaca, you can get an Ithaca Hour, I suppose.
[01:36:05.082 --> 01:36:05.762]  I don't hardly use them.
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:13.145]  But you can get a Michigan hour and wherever you try to cash it, they take off about 10%.
[01:36:13.245 --> 01:36:14.105]  It's really only worth about $9.
[01:36:14.445 --> 01:36:15.426]  No, I hear you.
[01:36:15.466 --> 01:36:16.247]  Let me comment on that.
[01:36:16.267 --> 01:36:17.207]  I'm going to move forward.
[01:36:17.527 --> 01:36:18.548]  It's a great question.
[01:36:18.588 --> 01:36:19.709]  Let me add my point on this.
[01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:31.437]  I believe in multiple competing currencies, an overall national currency, but in our founding and in many other free nations, they've had competing currencies because that does several things.
[01:36:32.077 --> 01:36:40.924]  It educates the public about alternative systems and takes away the mystification of these fiat currencies put out by private banks.
[01:36:40.964 --> 01:36:41.424]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:36:42.325 --> 01:36:52.273]  The problem with the Ithaca money, and I love the system, it's a great system, and I do encourage people to put in place, if they can, local systems.
[01:36:52.293 --> 01:36:58.517]  There's only a little bit over $100,000 in Ithaca hours that are now out there.
[01:36:58.557 --> 01:37:00.619]  That figure is from just a few months ago, because
[01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:07.012]  They went to the American Monetary Institute, to people who run Ithaca Hours, to ask them how they could expand it.
[01:37:07.652 --> 01:37:16.377]  And, of course, the problem is that there are so many difficulties in using Ithaca Hours to buy anything that's made outside the community.
[01:37:16.417 --> 01:37:17.898]  Like, you can't buy a car with it.
[01:37:18.438 --> 01:37:24.641]  So, it's an expedient, and in some cases, it's an emergency measure that people have to use.
[01:37:25.427 --> 01:37:28.268]  But by itself, it's not the solution.
[01:37:28.308 --> 01:37:36.250]  So we've got to look at the national level and be able to find ways to educate people about national monetary reform.
[01:37:36.490 --> 01:37:40.191]  Well, we should also educate the public about silver and gold and other things.
[01:37:40.571 --> 01:37:44.432]  I mean, that is a true, you know, primitive currency that's always been used.
[01:37:44.452 --> 01:37:45.852]  So that's a whole other level of that.
[01:37:45.932 --> 01:37:48.193]  Josh in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:37:48.273 --> 01:37:49.333]  Welcome with Richard C. Cook.
[01:37:49.961 --> 01:37:51.522]  Alex, how are you doing, Mr. Cook?
[01:37:51.962 --> 01:37:52.442]  Hello.
[01:37:52.522 --> 01:37:57.924]  I'm a pretty recent listener to the show, and I agree with a lot of the ideas you have.
[01:37:58.564 --> 01:38:04.246]  My basic question is, these banks, they're pretty deep-rooted.
[01:38:04.306 --> 01:38:09.248]  I mean, it seems like they have control of these governments, and they use this debt to control everything.
[01:38:10.029 --> 01:38:12.970]  Is there really any way that we can make them lose this power?
[01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:15.870]  I mean, aren't we... We have beaten them four times.
[01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:18.471]  We have to educate the public about how this works.
[01:38:18.951 --> 01:38:23.372]  As things get worse and worse, the people that would only watch football before are now starting to listen.
[01:38:23.792 --> 01:38:24.872]  And we don't have a choice.
[01:38:25.312 --> 01:38:27.293]  And the states created the federal government.
[01:38:27.373 --> 01:38:31.874]  Thirty plus states are moving to declare sovereignty, reform the union if they have to.
[01:38:32.154 --> 01:38:34.934]  You have to first believe they can be beaten to do it.
[01:38:34.994 --> 01:38:36.855]  Third world countries beat them all the time.
[01:38:37.115 --> 01:38:37.575]  Mr. Cook?
[01:38:38.647 --> 01:38:45.250]  Every bank in the United States is chartered by a federal or a state government.
[01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:56.574]  Our system acknowledges at its deepest level that credit is a public utility and it does derive from the will of the people and the consent of the governed.
[01:38:57.094 --> 01:39:02.216]  We have the constitutional right and now we have to get the ability to take it back.
[01:39:02.736 --> 01:39:03.537]  It can be done.
[01:39:03.597 --> 01:39:04.517]  It belongs to us.
[01:39:04.597 --> 01:39:05.857]  It's been taken away from us.
[01:39:05.937 --> 01:39:06.878]  We have to take it back.
[01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:09.271]  Yeah, we have the moral authority, sir.
[01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:10.091]  We've been robbed.
[01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:11.452]  We've been shanghaied.
[01:39:11.492 --> 01:39:12.432]  We've been hijacked.
[01:39:12.472 --> 01:39:13.472]  We've been bushwhacked.
[01:39:13.512 --> 01:39:14.612]  We've been bamboozled.
[01:39:15.132 --> 01:39:16.133]  We've been gang-raped.
[01:39:16.193 --> 01:39:18.893]  I mean, whatever terms you want to use, they're the bad guys.
[01:39:19.633 --> 01:39:24.354]  It's this magician's illusion in their fancy suits and on TV.
[01:39:24.554 --> 01:39:25.914]  They're a pack of crooks.
[01:39:26.234 --> 01:39:29.895]  We need to get that popular rage of true populism going.
[01:39:30.275 --> 01:39:30.815]  Mr. Cook?
[01:39:31.415 --> 01:39:35.116]  Now, back in October, when Paulson went to Congress,
[01:39:35.819 --> 01:39:43.345]  With the first of the big bailout bills, and that bailout came about, by the way, because Europe refused to stop buying our toxic debt.
[01:39:43.906 --> 01:39:46.308]  So Paulson went to Congress, and you remember what happened?
[01:39:46.328 --> 01:39:51.432]  The very first time that went before the House of Representatives, the House voted it down.
[01:39:51.912 --> 01:39:53.654]  Now, if they had stood their ground,
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:55.861]  And put it down the next time.
[01:39:55.921 --> 01:39:58.642]  We might have a completely different situation.
[01:39:58.702 --> 01:40:01.804]  But the bankers engaged in financial terrorism.
[01:40:02.264 --> 01:40:03.985]  They went on air and said, we're going to have a depression.
[01:40:04.225 --> 01:40:08.848]  And the stock market dropped, you know, from $10,000 down to $8,000 or whatever.
[01:40:09.268 --> 01:40:10.749]  And look, we gave in to the terrorism.
[01:40:10.769 --> 01:40:11.649]  Did it help us, Mr. Cook?
[01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:14.531]  Oh, it ruined us.
[01:40:14.831 --> 01:40:16.272]  That was the defining moment.
[01:40:16.912 --> 01:40:20.554]  And when John McCain came to Washington, he had the intent
[01:40:21.124 --> 01:40:21.304]  I don't
[01:40:40.802 --> 01:40:42.904]  We would have a far different situation today.
[01:40:43.224 --> 01:40:46.086]  And in came the military option, as you mentioned earlier.
[01:40:46.126 --> 01:40:49.329]  Yeah, they started telling people there were going to be terrorists in the streets.
[01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:51.151]  Martial law, all that.
[01:40:51.751 --> 01:41:05.002]  Yeah, I mean, if that isn't terrorism, to have the Secretary of the Treasury and the head of the private Fed saying, the President's going to declare martial law and do this anyway, they should have gone out and had a press conference and said we were just threatened by economic terrorists and
[01:41:06.243 --> 01:41:08.504]  Started a house investigation to arrest those men.
[01:41:08.804 --> 01:41:11.685]  Instead, they put their tail between their legs, urinated on themselves.
[01:41:12.405 --> 01:41:14.086]  All that came from the big banks.
[01:41:15.727 --> 01:41:17.687]  I mean, folks, we... Driving that whole scenario.
[01:41:18.148 --> 01:41:22.169]  We have offshore banks threatening martial law in America.
[01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:25.190]  I mean, this is outrageous, Mr. Cook!
[01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:26.411]  That's correct.
[01:41:27.191 --> 01:41:27.951]  That is correct.
[01:41:28.752 --> 01:41:30.432]  It's the international banking system.
[01:41:30.792 --> 01:41:32.373]  And it's an interlocking system.
[01:41:33.193 --> 01:41:34.794]  And the center of it, you know,
[01:41:35.778 --> 01:41:37.320]  It's not even in the United States.
[01:41:38.041 --> 01:41:46.670]  It's spread all over the place, but it's an international system, and they're the ones who direct the Federal Reserve, and they're the ones who direct the Treasury policy.
[01:41:47.591 --> 01:41:55.479]  And right now, the whole objective of the Obama budget with the continued bailouts is to keep that system afloat.
[01:41:57.679 --> 01:41:58.660]  Richard C. Cooks, our guest.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:03.002]  We're going to come back and take more calls from Mike, Zachary, and others.
[01:42:03.082 --> 01:42:05.003]  Kevin, who disagreed, would have been first, but he hung up.
[01:42:05.563 --> 01:42:06.464]  Richard C. Cooks, our guest.
[01:42:06.504 --> 01:42:07.704]  An amazing researcher.
[01:42:07.764 --> 01:42:11.146]  He is one of the most accurate individuals breaking it down.
[01:42:11.206 --> 01:42:12.226]  Probably the most accurate.
[01:42:12.266 --> 01:42:15.488]  He concurs with my analysis more than anybody else.
[01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:18.610]  Because the banks do this over and over again throughout history.
[01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:19.750]  They brag about it.
[01:42:20.050 --> 01:42:21.751]  Of course it's all premeditated.
[01:42:21.771 --> 01:42:22.552]  They're behind it.
[01:42:23.553 --> 01:42:25.055]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:42:25.235 --> 01:42:26.697]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:42:26.997 --> 01:42:29.219]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.425]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:42:34.826 --> 01:42:37.629]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:42:38.009 --> 01:42:41.473]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:53.883]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:42:54.443 --> 01:42:56.444]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:42:56.464 --> 01:42:57.764]  I use one every day.
[01:42:58.184 --> 01:43:00.625]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:43:00.885 --> 01:43:01.625]  We're good to go.
[01:43:23.672 --> 01:43:30.055]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:43:30.435 --> 01:43:32.436]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:43:33.076 --> 01:43:34.096]  But who is the enemy?
[01:43:34.636 --> 01:43:35.137]  Bin Laden.
[01:43:35.437 --> 01:43:36.337]  This is his ammo.
[01:43:36.357 --> 01:43:37.778]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:43:37.798 --> 01:43:39.478]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:43:39.779 --> 01:43:46.541]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:43:46.941 --> 01:43:47.382]  Some U.S.
[01:43:47.422 --> 01:43:53.084]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:43:53.764 --> 01:43:57.205]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:43:57.225 --> 01:43:59.245]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:44:24.153 --> 01:44:31.799]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[01:44:32.219 --> 01:44:33.380]  You need the Paclite!
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:41.686]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[01:44:42.047 --> 01:44:45.209]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[01:44:45.609 --> 01:44:50.053]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[01:44:50.453 --> 01:44:51.714]  The Paclite is so durable,
[01:44:51.974 --> 01:44:56.356]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[01:44:56.797 --> 01:45:01.099]  The Paclite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[01:45:01.459 --> 01:45:08.143]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.
[01:45:08.463 --> 01:45:11.444]  That address again is 9voltlite.com, or call
[01:45:12.585 --> 01:45:13.546]  Call us today at 877-715-4448.
[01:45:13.566 --> 01:45:13.766]  That's 877-715-4448.
[01:45:40.084 --> 01:45:44.505]  All right, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:44.525 --> 01:45:51.267]  I forgot to ask you during the break, Mr. Cook, because I want to go to all these calls.
[01:45:51.287 --> 01:45:55.168]  Can you stay five minutes with us into the next hour?
[01:46:09.417 --> 01:46:10.097]  Mr. Cook, are you there?
[01:46:10.918 --> 01:46:11.578]  Yes, can you hear me?
[01:46:11.939 --> 01:46:12.359]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:12.379 --> 01:46:13.820]  Can we keep you five minutes until the next hour?
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.261]  Yeah, five minutes to work, yeah.
[01:46:15.341 --> 01:46:16.201]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:46:16.241 --> 01:46:17.722]  I meant to ask you that during the break and forgot to.
[01:46:17.742 --> 01:46:18.503]  Okay.
[01:46:18.583 --> 01:46:20.845]  Let's go ahead and go back to the callers here.
[01:46:20.865 --> 01:46:22.966]  And folks, have you seen me frothing and chomping at the bit?
[01:46:23.306 --> 01:46:24.147]  This is history!
[01:46:24.627 --> 01:46:28.690]  Are they going to bring in worldwide tyranny through the scam they've committed with all the money they've stolen?
[01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:30.331]  Or are we going to bring them to justice?
[01:46:30.391 --> 01:46:31.992]  And Mr. Cook, doesn't it come down to just that?
[01:46:33.427 --> 01:46:34.328]  Well, yes.
[01:46:34.708 --> 01:46:40.933]  I can give an example also of another thing that was said at this conference I just went to in New York last weekend.
[01:46:41.554 --> 01:46:51.822]  There was an economist from the University of Massachusetts there, his name was Thomas Ferguson, who'd been working with the Banking Committee on Capitol Hill when the October crisis occurred.
[01:46:52.482 --> 01:47:02.130]  And he pointed out that the Bush-Obama bank bailouts alone will cause a permanent addition of interest payments on the national debt
[01:47:02.853 --> 01:47:06.075]  Of a hundred billion dollars a year forever.
[01:47:06.996 --> 01:47:16.102]  That means every American is going to pay during the course of his or her lifetime, on the average, $20,000 for this bank rescue.
[01:47:16.143 --> 01:47:20.666]  This one action of bailing out the banks.
[01:47:20.686 --> 01:47:21.386]  $20,000 in a lifetime.
[01:47:21.907 --> 01:47:23.928]  And now they're telling us more and more of these.
[01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.969]  Yeah.
[01:47:25.449 --> 01:47:26.150]  Yeah.
[01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:30.633]  These are the decisions that are being made by our elected government today.
[01:47:31.937 --> 01:47:33.758]  Unbelievable crime, unbelievable.
[01:47:34.439 --> 01:47:35.740]  Just absolutely incredible.
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:39.142]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Wisconsin.
[01:47:39.182 --> 01:47:40.443]  Mike, you're on the air with Richard C. Cook.
[01:47:40.483 --> 01:47:40.823]  Go ahead.
[01:47:40.843 --> 01:47:42.884]  Hey, good afternoon Alex and Richard.
[01:47:43.645 --> 01:47:44.185]  Yes, hello.
[01:47:45.546 --> 01:47:49.048]  I'm a Prison Planet member and I have the Obama Deception pre-ordered.
[01:47:50.169 --> 01:47:56.393]  I've been unemployed since September and I was making like 18 bucks an hour when I was let go.
[01:47:57.426 --> 01:47:59.066]  I'm right now collecting unemployment.
[01:47:59.346 --> 01:48:00.167]  I don't have a mortgage.
[01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:02.847]  I was foreclosed a couple years ago, so I'm renting.
[01:48:03.467 --> 01:48:15.549]  Should I take any kind of part-time job, full-time job, no matter what it pays right now, or should I kind of hold out for something that pays what I was, you know, making when I was let go, or... Right now my wife works.
[01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:18.670]  We do have an income, but, you know, what are your thoughts on that?
[01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:20.610]  Well, I would say this... Go ahead.
[01:48:20.650 --> 01:48:21.130]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:48:21.471 --> 01:48:21.991]  No, you go ahead.
[01:48:22.851 --> 01:48:23.711]  Well, I can't...
[01:48:24.204 --> 01:48:28.269]  I can't tell any individual what to do if I were in that position.
[01:48:28.289 --> 01:48:38.762]  I would certainly do my best to earn the money that I could because you never know down the road if it's going to get any better, so I think a bird in the hand is better than nothing.
[01:48:39.591 --> 01:48:41.813]  Yeah, look, you've already paid all this in in taxes.
[01:48:42.133 --> 01:48:44.234]  It's all fiat made-up money to begin with.
[01:48:44.674 --> 01:48:49.017]  The illegal aliens are all, you know, two or three, four welfare checks apiece, milking it.
[01:48:49.418 --> 01:48:50.518]  Everything's going bankrupt.
[01:48:50.879 --> 01:48:52.300]  I would take that unemployment check.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:53.680]  I mean, this is what I would do.
[01:48:54.181 --> 01:49:01.406]  And I would go out and mow lawns or, you know, pick up cans or whatever on the side because it's only going to be the underground economy that's going to let people survive.
[01:49:01.526 --> 01:49:04.167]  I would be making as much money as you can.
[01:49:04.308 --> 01:49:09.111]  I would be... I know people that are losing their jobs or they get a new job and they're lazy and they drag around.
[01:49:09.931 --> 01:49:11.993]  Americans, a lot of them have gotten lazy and entitled.
[01:49:12.013 --> 01:49:13.494]  A lot of us are really hard working.
[01:49:13.854 --> 01:49:19.318]  I don't want to oversimplify things, but I don't think people realize we're going into a long sustained depression.
[01:49:19.618 --> 01:49:24.962]  I think all the evidence shows so you better, especially people that have children are being lazy out there.
[01:49:25.242 --> 01:49:33.307]  You better be busting your butts to get in as best a position as you can because it's only going to get worse, I'd say for the next five years.
[01:49:33.347 --> 01:49:34.048]  Mr. Cook, do you agree?
[01:49:34.781 --> 01:49:37.742]  Yeah, I agree with that, and I think that's a good suggestion, Alex.
[01:49:37.782 --> 01:49:47.147]  There's a lot of ways to earn money out there now that are available that we can, you know, kind of do out of our wits, and sure, do it.
[01:49:48.767 --> 01:49:49.448]  Absolutely.
[01:49:49.548 --> 01:49:55.230]  I mean, look, get your hands legally on as much money as you can and start living more simply.
[01:49:55.290 --> 01:49:56.091]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:56.371 --> 01:49:57.751]  Five more minutes with Mr. Cook.
[01:49:57.771 --> 01:50:00.332]  We've got state representatives joining us, declaring sovereignty.
[01:50:00.713 --> 01:50:01.153]  Stay with us.
[01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:06.655]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:50:13.663 --> 01:50:15.204]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:15.324 --> 01:50:19.948]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:20.088 --> 01:50:22.831]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:23.051 --> 01:50:25.893]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:50:26.094 --> 01:50:31.979]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:50:32.179 --> 01:50:35.121]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:50:35.421 --> 01:50:38.364]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food
[01:50:38.424 --> 01:50:42.305]  It's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:50:42.365 --> 01:50:45.526]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:50:45.666 --> 01:50:46.426]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:50:46.586 --> 01:50:50.788]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.

[01:51:00.951 --> 01:51:02.791]  Again, 1-800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:51:08.433 --> 01:51:09.435]  Take action today.
[01:51:09.455 --> 01:51:11.398]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:51:16.225 --> 01:51:18.148]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:21.393]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:51:34.338 --> 01:51:44.426]  New Hampshire, Oklahoma, many others are on the verge of passing 10th Amendment declarations for no martial law, no gun confiscation, no forced conscription.
[01:51:44.446 --> 01:51:45.687]  30 plus states are moving to do it.
[01:51:45.707 --> 01:51:48.810]  We'll be talking to some state reps coming up in this hour and more news.
[01:51:49.230 --> 01:51:57.977]  And your phone call, Richard C. Cook, former White House analyst, NASA consultant, written for major publications out there like the Washington Post.
[01:51:58.618 --> 01:52:00.659]  He is our guest right now.
[01:52:02.301 --> 01:52:03.962]  We're taking a few final calls for him.
[01:52:04.422 --> 01:52:07.963]  Let's talk to Zachary, holding patiently from Hawaii.
[01:52:08.603 --> 01:52:09.844]  Zachary, you're on the air.
[01:52:09.924 --> 01:52:10.304]  Welcome.
[01:52:11.405 --> 01:52:11.745]  Hello.
[01:52:12.385 --> 01:52:12.805]  Yes, sir.
[01:52:12.845 --> 01:52:14.006]  Nice to talk to you again.
[01:52:14.146 --> 01:52:15.206]  I had a couple questions.
[01:52:17.307 --> 01:52:20.328]  And they were about gold and silver.
[01:52:20.348 --> 01:52:30.312]  I bought some gold and silver, and I was wondering about the amount stolen and hoarded throughout history, and then
[01:52:31.041 --> 01:52:39.345]  You know, like how it could be released in order to manipulate the market, like oil and Enron and diamonds and the housing market, maybe.
[01:52:39.725 --> 01:52:41.706]  And then I was wondering, like, who would buy it?
[01:52:42.007 --> 01:52:47.109]  If everyone's being broke, if everyone's broke, who could buy it?
[01:52:47.469 --> 01:52:52.052]  I was just thinking that the consumption would be better.
[01:52:52.072 --> 01:52:56.674]  I think there's plenty of people who have money to buy things, and the way it works is
[01:52:57.284 --> 01:53:17.695]  But they drive down the markets, you know, they corner the market on these things and they drive down the market price and then when it's driven down and all the people who are scared out of the market get out and sell their commodities, then the people with the money or with the credit, because they can still create money out of thin air, which they do and are doing, then they step in and they buy it up.
[01:53:18.235 --> 01:53:23.478]  You just have to watch these commodity markets very carefully and try to understand who is manipulating these markets.
[01:53:23.868 --> 01:53:30.079]  But there's always people with money who can create money out of nothing who control the banking system still.
[01:53:30.119 --> 01:53:32.042]  I mean, there's still a world banking system out there.
[01:53:32.557 --> 01:53:34.138]  Mr. Cook, you're from Hawaii you said?
[01:54:03.424 --> 01:54:04.044]  You're from Hawaii?
[01:54:04.285 --> 01:54:04.925]  We never said that.
[01:54:04.945 --> 01:54:06.586]  We said you were from Hawaii, Zachary.
[01:54:07.306 --> 01:54:07.567]  Oh, okay.
[01:54:07.587 --> 01:54:09.068]  I thought you said you had a guest from Hawaii.
[01:54:09.548 --> 01:54:12.970]  We had a guest the hour before last from Hawaii, Mike Rivero.
[01:54:13.731 --> 01:54:14.231]  Oh, okay.
[01:54:14.291 --> 01:54:15.332]  I misunderstood.
[01:54:16.853 --> 01:54:17.653]  Yeah, Mike Rivero.
[01:54:17.753 --> 01:54:18.954]  I didn't think it was the same name.
[01:54:19.094 --> 01:54:32.963]  I had a question about Hawaii, though, and I was thinking about the... I live in Maui, and I'm thinking that the familiarity of self-sufficiency is very high, so I thought that would be kind of a weird thing, and then I thought of a
[01:54:33.877 --> 01:54:35.078]  I think so.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:57.722]  I thought if they made another Volkswagen Hawaii, they would... Well, we don't speculate a lot, but I appreciate your call.
[01:54:57.742 --> 01:55:05.785]  I lived on a farm for 10 years, and while I was working for the government, I went home to farm, and we never ate better in our lives.
[01:55:05.865 --> 01:55:07.066]  It was a blessing.
[01:55:08.396 --> 01:55:10.197]  Beyond the land is a blessing, wherever you are.
[01:55:10.538 --> 01:55:14.200]  Yeah, I'm looking at trying to move to something an hour away from Austin.
[01:55:14.441 --> 01:55:19.284]  It's going to be a big hassle commuting, and I don't really have the money to do it, so I'm looking around, but I want to get out of here.
[01:55:19.304 --> 01:55:21.826]  I mean, it's always smart to do that in these type of times.
[01:55:22.206 --> 01:55:23.267]  Thank you so much, caller.
[01:55:23.367 --> 01:55:24.728]  I'll have to get to Charles and others later.
[01:55:25.008 --> 01:55:27.750]  Well, Richard C. Cook, we'll have to have you back up again in the near future.
[01:55:27.790 --> 01:55:29.091]  I really appreciate all your time.
[01:55:29.432 --> 01:55:30.793]  RichardCCook.com.
[01:55:31.233 --> 01:55:33.935]  I think we've got a good chance in closing to actually beat these people.
[01:55:33.955 --> 01:55:36.937]  Do you think they've overreached, or do you... I mean, what's the chances that we can win? 60%?
[01:55:39.150 --> 01:55:39.570]  I'd say 60.
[01:55:40.051 --> 01:55:42.013]  They have overreached incredibly.
[01:55:42.073 --> 01:55:43.114]  People are waking up.
[01:55:43.174 --> 01:55:51.545]  And there were times in American history when working Americans like us knew how these systems worked and how to fix them.
[01:55:51.605 --> 01:55:53.087]  And we're coming back there.
[01:55:53.107 --> 01:55:53.908]  We're getting back there.
[01:55:53.928 --> 01:55:54.729]  We've got to keep it up.
[01:55:55.501 --> 01:55:58.322]  All right, yeah, it's been the big party while the bankers were setting us up.
[01:55:58.702 --> 01:56:02.383]  Now folks are finding out that Musical Chairs has ended and there's not enough chairs.
[01:56:02.943 --> 01:56:04.103]  We'll talk to you soon, Mr. Cook.
[01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:04.563]  Take care.
[01:56:05.083 --> 01:56:05.623]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:56:06.023 --> 01:56:06.323]  You bet.
[01:56:06.343 --> 01:56:07.384]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:07.564 --> 01:56:09.524]  All right, got some very important state reps.
[01:56:10.024 --> 01:56:11.905]  Talk about 1776 and that spirit.
[01:56:11.945 --> 01:56:14.225]  It is a live and welded day thanks to you spreading the word.
[01:56:14.585 --> 01:56:16.706]  We'll talk to these guys coming up and a lot more.
[01:56:16.766 --> 01:56:17.166]  Stay with us.
[01:56:24.187 --> 01:56:27.629]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:34.434]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:56:35.095 --> 01:56:35.795]  Here is why.
[01:56:36.556 --> 01:56:46.483]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[01:56:47.003 --> 01:56:49.386]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[01:56:49.746 --> 01:56:51.828]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:56:51.868 --> 01:56:52.328]  this fall?
[01:56:52.849 --> 01:56:53.349]  Don't wait.
[01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:57.393]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.
[01:56:57.714 --> 01:57:00.536]  Get the details at foodshortageusa.com.
[01:57:01.057 --> 01:57:02.558]  That's foodshortageusa.com.
[01:57:03.739 --> 01:57:08.062]  Or you can call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[01:57:08.462 --> 01:57:09.762]  Don't wait for empty shelves.
[01:57:10.243 --> 01:57:13.525]  Go to foodshortageusa.com while you still have time.
[01:57:14.105 --> 01:57:20.168]  www.foodshortageusa.com or toll-free at 877-327-0365.
[01:57:20.188 --> 01:57:22.630]  Act now!
[01:57:22.650 --> 01:57:29.994]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:57:30.354 --> 01:57:32.015]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:57:32.992 --> 01:57:34.013]  But who is the enemy?
[01:57:34.534 --> 01:57:35.035]  Bin Laden.
[01:57:35.335 --> 01:57:36.136]  This is his MO.
[01:57:36.156 --> 01:57:37.638]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:57:37.678 --> 01:57:39.360]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:46.448]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:57:46.848 --> 01:57:47.289]  Some U.S.
[01:57:47.329 --> 01:57:52.996]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:57:53.656 --> 01:57:57.157]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:57:57.177 --> 01:57:59.318]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:58:23.743 --> 01:58:27.126]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:58:27.266 --> 01:58:32.491]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:58:32.671 --> 01:58:37.455]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:58:37.836 --> 01:58:48.946]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:58:49.346 --> 01:58:54.891]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:58:55.111 --> 01:59:01.197]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:59:01.377 --> 01:59:02.037]  What about you?
[01:59:02.418 --> 01:59:08.463]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:25.942]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:59:26.462 --> 01:59:29.265]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:31.335 --> 01:59:36.900]  One of the subjects that we cover in the Obama Deception is solutions.
[01:59:37.821 --> 01:59:46.768]  Like the majority of the states moving to declare sovereignty their rightful duty as representatives of the people, the states created the federal government.
[01:59:46.788 --> 01:59:51.832]  So again, I want to encourage all of the listeners out there, pre-order the Obama Deception now.
[01:59:52.973 --> 01:59:56.115]  It's going to be shipping in 12 days from now.
[01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:57.336]  That is a twinkle of an eye.
[01:59:57.716 --> 02:00:02.139]  Get your order in so you're the first to have it shipped out to you today.
[02:00:02.599 --> 02:00:03.680]  The Obama Deception.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:07.502]  Go to obamadeception.net or theobamadeception.net
[02:00:09.466 --> 02:00:12.008]  And you can pre-order the film right there.
[02:00:12.028 --> 02:00:21.116]  You can also go to InfoWars.com and get all my other books and videos that I've produced or written or that we carry, like Eye of the Phoenix, which we have discounted out of the gates.
[02:00:21.276 --> 02:00:24.939]  America's Secret History Revealed, Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:28.823]  We have another great video, The Money Masters, three and a half hours long, 1995.
[02:00:30.004 --> 02:00:32.486]  Full education on the history of the bankers, how they operate.
[02:00:32.846 --> 02:00:34.568]  Know your enemy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:35.228 --> 02:00:40.231]  You know, folks know all about football and all about partying and all about acting cool.
[02:00:40.791 --> 02:00:43.732]  People aren't stupid, they're distracted.
[02:00:43.813 --> 02:00:49.335]  They're experts on things that don't matter, instead of being experts on things that completely and absolutely matter.
[02:00:51.276 --> 02:00:56.999]  So again, theobamadeception.net or go to infowars.com to pre-order it today or call toll free to get any of the books and videos at 888-
[02:00:58.479 --> 02:01:04.021]  Two-five-three, three-one-three-nine, triple-eight, two-five-three, three-one-three-nine.
[02:01:04.381 --> 02:01:07.102]  You'll also be able to watch it online coming up on the 15th.
[02:01:07.142 --> 02:01:10.883]  That'll be the first people to see it because it'll be shipping out on the 15th in super high quality.
[02:01:11.343 --> 02:01:13.504]  It's almost DVD quality for the highest connections.
[02:01:13.544 --> 02:01:15.565]  We have some lower connection rates that also look great.
[02:01:16.465 --> 02:01:21.530]  Flash players, you know, just a bunch here with four different formats, three different qualities in each format.
[02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:23.371]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:01:23.391 --> 02:01:33.620]  We've also got a remake, redo of Web 2.0, the latest Web 2.0 version of PrisonPlanet.tv with a lot of new functions coming up in the next few weeks as well for all the folks at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:40.326]  And we've added a new three-hour show on PrisonPlanet.tv, Samuel Castle on the radio through the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:40.726 --> 02:01:51.249]  In association with the InfoWars Network and GCN, 9 to Midnight Central Standard Time, Jason Burnham is live with just huge guests lined up.
[02:01:51.670 --> 02:01:56.191]  He had Gilbert Griffin on last night covering a lot of key stuff.
[02:01:56.831 --> 02:01:59.212]  Please join Jason every night from 9 to Midnight.
[02:01:59.552 --> 02:02:03.753]  For folks that listen during the day and can't call into my show, well now you've got this show right out of the seat.
[02:02:03.913 --> 02:02:08.015]  I'm sitting right here in Austin, Texas, so 9 to Midnight Central.
[02:02:09.275 --> 02:02:17.540]  We're joined by State Representative Paul Ingridson and we also of course have Dan Itza coming up a little bit later in the show.
[02:02:18.461 --> 02:02:24.364]  They're having a rally coming up in the next few days to try to get their Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment resolution passed in New Hampshire.
[02:02:24.584 --> 02:02:29.387]  They have the best written, it's got a bunch of stuff in quotes of Thomas Jefferson in there.
[02:02:30.808 --> 02:02:34.329]  They have the best resolution of 31 states now that we've seen.
[02:02:34.349 --> 02:02:38.931]  A lot of other states are adopting similar variants of what they've done.
[02:02:39.491 --> 02:02:43.032]  And Oklahoma's passed it to their House, about to pass it to their Senate this week.
[02:02:43.072 --> 02:02:44.552]  They believe they have the votes.
[02:02:44.652 --> 02:02:46.373]  Other states are passing and are about to pass it.
[02:02:46.673 --> 02:02:52.355]  But New Hampshire, the live, free, or die state, where our revolution really began, is so key to all of this.
[02:02:52.415 --> 02:02:55.636]  So it's really great to have you on, Representative Paul Ingbrunsten.
[02:02:55.856 --> 02:02:56.496]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:02:56.516 --> 02:02:58.477]  The pleasure's mine, Alex.
[02:02:58.517 --> 02:02:59.777]  Thank you very much for having us again.
[02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:00.570]  You bet.
[02:03:00.610 --> 02:03:03.952]  Last time, you didn't get a lot of time to talk because I had Dan on.
[02:03:04.013 --> 02:03:06.554]  Now he's not on with us right now, so you've got the floor.
[02:03:06.614 --> 02:03:14.459]  Break down why you're doing this, what it's like to see, since you guys and others started this, to see it spread like wildfire, get national, international attention.
[02:03:14.499 --> 02:03:16.281]  People on the streets are excited in Austin.
[02:03:16.641 --> 02:03:25.727]  I got family coming to town and friends asking me about it because they instinctively know this is one of the key ways for a redress of grievances with this rogue federal government.
[02:03:27.214 --> 02:03:37.498]  Alex, the exciting part about this, and it is actually very exciting, and it's very nice to see that you're striking a chord with the, in the hearts of a lot of Americans.
[02:03:37.558 --> 02:03:44.580]  I mean, you get frustrated after a while, as you've been in your own experience, I'm sure, wondering if there's anybody out there who cares, who even sees this kind of stuff.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:48.082]  It's just become too much arcane, digging into the past and all that sort of thing.
[02:03:48.502 --> 02:03:52.363]  So it's really been fantastic to have the, to have the,
[02:03:54.656 --> 02:04:02.386]  You know, people start rising up behind us, and in fact what it now does for us is it makes us look ahead and say, what in the heck are we going to do if we ever manage to get the states to get together?
[02:04:03.147 --> 02:04:11.598]  And it's really critical for us to start thinking that way, and I suggest that your listeners, yourself, as well, begin to think what a conference would look like, what a conference in the states would look like.
[02:04:12.110 --> 02:04:15.433]  The last thing I want to do, actually, is change our form of government.
[02:04:15.453 --> 02:04:21.199]  And I would be, of course, very wary of any kind of a convention that would begin to do what our previous one did.
[02:04:21.259 --> 02:04:27.666]  And especially with the people around today, you could easily have one that would be turned into a very bad situation.
[02:04:27.726 --> 02:04:29.368]  So what in the world would this look like?
[02:04:29.408 --> 02:04:30.429]  We have to think that through.
[02:04:30.449 --> 02:04:32.451]  And that's where your mind goes next.
[02:04:32.947 --> 02:04:35.889]  Well, that's the great danger, you know, in any opportunities of danger.
[02:04:35.929 --> 02:04:37.751]  Now, the globalists have already seized D.C.
[02:04:38.111 --> 02:04:39.732]  They've already destroyed our form of government.
[02:04:39.973 --> 02:04:53.623]  The states must reconvene, at least at an individual level or as a group, to exercise their lawful, constitutional, organic, common law power that springs from basic free humanity, not even the documents themselves.
[02:04:53.664 --> 02:04:56.005]  They just enumerate some of those.
[02:04:56.886 --> 02:05:18.975]  So we don't have a choice but to do this, but I believe we need to have the states vote, as they already do, to go and do a CON CON, or something similar, to vote before they go with a pledge in stone of why they're going, and what they're going to do, and what they will vote for, and what their goals are.
[02:05:19.035 --> 02:05:22.917]  No gun confiscation, no more federal government out of control, abolish the Federal Reserve,
[02:05:23.657 --> 02:05:26.238]  And I think if we do that, then we can defeat them.
[02:05:26.258 --> 02:05:26.818]  Your comments?
[02:05:27.358 --> 02:05:32.619]  Well, I have a slightly different view, and I come to this, by the way, believe it or not, as an artist, too.
[02:05:32.819 --> 02:05:37.641]  You have to solve a problem, the problem of creating an aesthetic solution to something.
[02:05:37.661 --> 02:05:38.821]  You know, somebody just painted my portrait.
[02:05:38.841 --> 02:05:40.501]  You can't just knock out a picture of them.
[02:05:40.521 --> 02:05:43.842]  You have to do a whole bunch of other work, and it requires a whole bunch of research, a whole bunch of thinking.
[02:05:45.023 --> 02:05:46.463]  Everything from color schemes to whatnot.
[02:05:46.483 --> 02:05:50.264]  But you see the same thing in all the sciences, where you simply have to, first of all,
[02:05:50.768 --> 02:05:51.768]  Begin and look at the problem.
[02:05:51.788 --> 02:05:55.990]  I think the first part of any kind of a conference is to sit down and analyze what in the world we've done.
[02:05:56.030 --> 02:05:57.251]  What is this monster we've done here?
[02:05:57.671 --> 02:06:01.092]  That's the first thing, before you start making decisions about this or that part of it.
[02:06:01.512 --> 02:06:04.073]  And I think eventually what you'll see is there's no decision to be made.
[02:06:05.754 --> 02:06:06.814]  We'll continue, sir.
[02:06:07.335 --> 02:06:08.175]  Give us more of your plan.
[02:06:08.355 --> 02:06:14.958]  Well, for example, we need to find out why we aren't just coining gold and silver as required or whatever.
[02:06:16.587 --> 02:06:28.434]  Just one of many things that will lead them to a place where who controls the banks, who controls the, uh, you know, and all the different things from the income tax itself, which everybody knows about the fraud associated with that on your show, I'm sure.
[02:06:29.234 --> 02:06:34.077]  And, uh, you know, and all the federal usurpations and, you know, they're messing around with education.
[02:06:34.217 --> 02:06:36.878]  We have to look at piece by piece by piece to all this sort of thing.
[02:06:37.439 --> 02:06:45.283]  We also have to be fully aware and have it on our mind that we created the monster and it's our job to actually, as responsible parents to states,
[02:06:45.874 --> 02:06:48.175]  To then say, well, what do we do?
[02:06:49.155 --> 02:06:53.136]  And I'm not for a wholesale change, I'm for simply a cleaning of house, ideally.
[02:06:53.156 --> 02:06:55.737]  That would be my way of thinking of it, but I don't know what that looks like precisely.
[02:06:55.757 --> 02:06:58.318]  How will the states enforce that?
[02:06:59.458 --> 02:07:01.959]  I mean, we have to just go ahead and abolish the federal government.
[02:07:01.999 --> 02:07:05.240]  It is a rogue, criminal operation.
[02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:13.922]  Yes, you know, you're talking about uncharted turf, except for the fact that we created it, and we have all the authority in the world to do something about it.
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:24.372]  The real problem, it seems to me, and you probably have a lot more to say about this than I do, is at this stage, when we get to a serious point here, do we actually find ourselves in a civil war with our own government?
[02:07:25.093 --> 02:07:29.519]  Well, they're already usurpers of the first order, so you can assume that that would be the case, and how do we protect ourselves?
[02:07:29.599 --> 02:07:32.983]  I mean, you see bills coming out of different states now, or trying to create our own militias.
[02:07:33.504 --> 02:07:37.107]  On state militias, because the feds have usurped, or are in the process of usurping that.
[02:07:37.387 --> 02:07:38.107]  Yeah, Texas.
[02:07:39.308 --> 02:07:40.309]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:07:40.349 --> 02:07:42.931]  I mean, they're federalizing the National Guard, everything.
[02:07:43.431 --> 02:07:45.153]  They're going to stage terror attacks.
[02:07:45.173 --> 02:07:46.554]  They're going to stage riots.
[02:07:46.594 --> 02:07:47.955]  They're going to come after the states.
[02:07:48.315 --> 02:07:52.638]  The states up front, and that's what I'm seeing in these resolutions, need to know the problem.
[02:07:52.678 --> 02:07:57.021]  FEMA camps, gun confiscation, you know, and that's what's so exciting about the states.
[02:07:57.041 --> 02:07:59.183]  They're not just talking about unfunded mandates or something.
[02:07:59.883 --> 02:08:01.565]  I mean, they realize the monster.
[02:08:03.146 --> 02:08:04.086]  We wish it was different.
[02:08:04.407 --> 02:08:06.168]  It's a rogue criminal enterprise.
[02:08:06.208 --> 02:08:07.589]  We have allies in the federal government.
[02:08:08.349 --> 02:08:12.071]  But I think we need to address it fully for what this dragon is.
[02:08:12.111 --> 02:08:14.253]  This isn't some little serpent we're dealing with.
[02:08:14.273 --> 02:08:21.857]  This is a giant black dragon stomping around the countryside, and we have to go up against it like it's a big fire-breathing black dragon.
[02:08:24.199 --> 02:08:25.160]  We've got 50 nights.
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:25.720]  We can beat him.
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:26.961]  I agree.
[02:08:27.041 --> 02:08:30.543]  It's a very interesting phenomenon here in the United States.
[02:08:30.953 --> 02:08:36.297]  For whatever it's worth, I see this dragon in Revelations referred to as a lamb and as a dragon simultaneously.
[02:08:36.317 --> 02:08:38.899]  I believe there's a lamb here in the United States.
[02:08:38.939 --> 02:08:39.079]  It's us.
[02:08:39.099 --> 02:08:39.759]  It's we, the people.
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:45.664]  And we actually are believers in good government, and honesty, and justice, and liberty, and all these things.
[02:08:45.704 --> 02:08:46.564]  But there is a monster.
[02:08:46.824 --> 02:08:49.666]  There's no question there's a monster that's starting to run everything.
[02:08:49.687 --> 02:08:52.749]  It's starting to get its tentacles into just every single part of our lives.
[02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:55.231]  And yeah, so now it's time.
[02:08:55.311 --> 02:08:57.212]  Can the lamb actually empower itself?
[02:08:57.918 --> 02:08:59.960]  That's a real interesting problem for a lamb.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:05.844]  I suggest that he gets a whole bunch of lambs together and you begin to maybe have some possibility of doing it.
[02:09:07.245 --> 02:09:12.489]  Well, you know, the American people, the veneer of civilization is very thin, as my dad likes to say.
[02:09:12.669 --> 02:09:17.953]  I don't know if that characterizes as lambs, maybe castrated monkeys.
[02:09:20.535 --> 02:09:22.437]  Well, you've called us sheeple before, Alex.
[02:09:24.113 --> 02:09:24.613]  No, you're right.
[02:09:24.633 --> 02:09:29.077]  I mean, there are a bunch of sheep-like little government, but there's a lot of people that aren't.
[02:09:29.998 --> 02:09:34.081]  And, you know, people are getting tired of this dragon stomping around and burning down their villages, you know?
[02:09:34.681 --> 02:09:35.121]  Absolutely.
[02:09:35.342 --> 02:09:35.762]  Absolutely.
[02:09:35.882 --> 02:09:38.464]  That's a good metaphor.
[02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:40.766]  So, what's coming up here in the next few days?
[02:09:41.486 --> 02:09:44.048]  How good a chance do we have getting your resolution passed in New Hampshire?
[02:09:44.749 --> 02:09:50.293]  I don't know, but I see bipartisan support now, and I see that the Republican Party, the leadership is backing us.
[02:09:53.635 --> 02:09:57.617]  Which, um, bills like this in the past, you can't, you know, you haven't been able to get them.
[02:09:57.797 --> 02:09:58.437]  But here they are.
[02:09:58.818 --> 02:10:01.279]  And so, you know, I think we have a decent chance.
[02:10:01.379 --> 02:10:07.202]  I think we just simply have to do the fight on the floor, where the numbers have to show up outside on the street, which, by the way, is 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.
[02:10:07.962 --> 02:10:11.284]  And we've had a very, very cold day today, but tomorrow should be a better one.
[02:10:12.064 --> 02:10:17.687]  Hopefully people will show up and I'll be discouraged, but, uh, yeah, it takes a bunch of things to come into play simultaneously, and, uh,
[02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:22.754]  You know, with the help of God, you know, so much of this stuff is, we do what we can.
[02:10:23.375 --> 02:10:24.156]  Providence.
[02:10:24.696 --> 02:10:25.097]  That's right.
[02:10:25.377 --> 02:10:26.938]  So you have to call on Providence.
[02:10:26.958 --> 02:10:28.320]  You're calling on Providence right now?
[02:10:29.133 --> 02:10:29.613]  Absolutely.
[02:10:30.014 --> 02:10:30.494]  I am too.
[02:10:31.775 --> 02:10:32.476]  We rely on it.
[02:10:32.496 --> 02:10:34.037]  For those that don't know, there's true power in it.
[02:10:34.337 --> 02:10:34.998]  The greatest power.
[02:10:35.699 --> 02:10:36.119]  You know what?
[02:10:36.219 --> 02:10:41.343]  George Washington, a bunch of guys froze to death and died crossing the Delaware and going into Trenton.
[02:10:42.845 --> 02:10:43.845]  So what if it's cold?
[02:10:43.905 --> 02:10:45.667]  We need more people there because it's cold.
[02:10:46.227 --> 02:10:48.269]  That is sheep-like if folks aren't there.
[02:10:48.289 --> 02:10:49.810]  That's right.
[02:10:50.351 --> 02:10:55.615]  I say to you and to the listeners, let's not waste that incredible suffering and sacrifice.
[02:10:55.635 --> 02:10:57.437]  Let's not waste it for the next generation.
[02:10:58.311 --> 02:11:00.892]  Let's pass on what was given to us, but let's actually improve it.
[02:11:02.453 --> 02:11:05.454]  Representative Paul Ingbertson is our guest right now.
[02:11:05.474 --> 02:11:14.518]  We're going to come back and continue talking to him about where New Hampshire's going and what's happening in the rest of the country, and breathing more and more life and more and more power into what's developing.
[02:11:14.538 --> 02:11:20.201]  We're also looking for Dan Instead to pop in with us, but he looks like had some scheduling issues.
[02:11:20.281 --> 02:11:20.781]  Stay with us.
[02:11:20.801 --> 02:11:22.182]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:12:25.690 --> 02:12:28.091]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:12:28.111 --> 02:12:30.233]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:12:30.373 --> 02:12:31.934]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:12:31.974 --> 02:12:33.575]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:12:33.675 --> 02:12:36.497]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:12:36.537 --> 02:12:40.180]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:54.722]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:12:58.499 --> 02:12:59.639]  How dare you?
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:05.981]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:13:06.001 --> 02:13:08.822]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:13:08.902 --> 02:13:15.044]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:14:23.735 --> 02:14:24.916]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[02:14:25.096 --> 02:14:27.377]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[02:14:27.517 --> 02:14:33.660]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food if you're a politician who voted for the bailout.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:47.627]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[02:14:47.848 --> 02:14:53.973]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[02:14:54.213 --> 02:14:57.616]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[02:14:57.816 --> 02:15:02.020]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:03.541]  For the rest of you, go to eFoods.com.
[02:15:08.507 --> 02:15:10.728]  Before you slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have a
[02:15:35.143 --> 02:15:51.077]  We are back live.
[02:15:53.019 --> 02:15:56.021]  We do have Representative Dan Itza with us as well.
[02:15:56.041 --> 02:16:02.427]  And we have Representative Paul Ingbertson with us from New Hampshire.
[02:16:04.175 --> 02:16:07.357]  Let's go ahead and go to Dan first.
[02:16:07.377 --> 02:16:09.518]  We've got both these guys still 40 after them.
[02:16:09.578 --> 02:16:10.778]  I'm going to blitz through some news.
[02:16:11.559 --> 02:16:14.040]  Representative Itza, I tell you, this is really catching on.
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:15.761]  A wildfire across the country.
[02:16:15.781 --> 02:16:20.423]  More than 30 states introducing or passing or passing through one or more of their houses.
[02:16:21.184 --> 02:16:23.785]  What's coming up in the next few days with this rally in New Hampshire?
[02:16:25.086 --> 02:16:29.428]  Tomorrow morning, 8 to 12, and I didn't organize it.
[02:16:29.448 --> 02:16:32.410]  It was organized by the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance.
[02:16:34.289 --> 02:16:39.131]  Well, which I am political director, but I'm just going along for the ride here, guys.
[02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:47.195]  I'm having, you know, enough work just to keep up with what's being thrown in my direction.
[02:16:48.216 --> 02:16:50.097]  So we're having a rally.
[02:16:50.377 --> 02:16:51.638]  It's 8 to 12.
[02:16:51.698 --> 02:16:53.559]  Speakers are going to start at 830.
[02:16:54.699 --> 02:17:02.143]  And giving encouragement to the people that, you know, we may just be able to pass this thing.
[02:17:02.657 --> 02:17:04.598]  And that's going to be in front of the Capitol, right?
[02:17:05.279 --> 02:17:07.120]  Yes, it's on the Statehouse steps.
[02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:09.722]  Okay, let's get to the wider picture.
[02:17:09.742 --> 02:17:14.465]  Since you've been on with me, you've been on Coast to Coast AM, Fox News, other channels, other state reps.
[02:17:14.885 --> 02:17:16.526]  The people have a huge hunger for this.
[02:17:16.686 --> 02:17:17.487]  Is this exciting?
[02:17:18.928 --> 02:17:20.589]  It's tremendously exciting.
[02:17:20.849 --> 02:17:25.011]  To me, it's exciting that that spirit of liberty is still out there.
[02:17:25.392 --> 02:17:29.754]  You know, proffering these bills for Paul and I, and we've been in the House
[02:17:30.868 --> 02:17:33.709]  Together for four terms, now this is our fifth term.
[02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:40.691]  And, you know, we've proffered these kinds of bills before to no avail.
[02:17:41.111 --> 02:17:42.371]  It's fallen on deaf ears.
[02:17:43.132 --> 02:17:47.693]  But somehow this one has just caught the heart of the people.
[02:17:48.153 --> 02:17:49.494]  And that's what it's all about.
[02:17:49.714 --> 02:17:51.974]  Well, it's because the new law is coming into play.
[02:17:53.535 --> 02:17:55.215]  You know, that's something I want to bring up.
[02:17:55.755 --> 02:17:57.536]  You know, what's really coming into it,
[02:17:58.308 --> 02:18:00.769]  There's this coined phrase, the New World Order.
[02:18:01.530 --> 02:18:03.230]  But you know what the New World Order is?
[02:18:03.250 --> 02:18:04.451]  The Old World Order.
[02:18:05.111 --> 02:18:06.192]  It's the Old World Order.
[02:18:06.232 --> 02:18:14.036]  The New World Order is what was established here in the New World of government by the people, with the people on top and the government at the bottom.
[02:18:14.616 --> 02:18:23.381]  This gravitation toward an oligarchical or monarchical society, a hierarchical top-down government, that's the Old World Order.
[02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:24.101]  And we've got this
[02:18:24.491 --> 02:18:28.612]  We've got to stop the old world order from being established here in America.
[02:18:30.072 --> 02:18:30.952]  Very well said.
[02:18:31.472 --> 02:18:36.914]  Now, both of you pop in here, but first, Representative Itza, how close are you?
[02:18:36.954 --> 02:18:46.295]  I mean, I've been told by state senators and house members in Oklahoma it's a pretty much done deal for them sometime this week or next week to get a powerful resolution passed similar to yours.
[02:18:47.776 --> 02:18:52.297]  I hear it's not better in New Hampshire, but who do we need to put pressure on?
[02:18:52.317 --> 02:18:54.117]  What do we need to do to get this passed in New Hampshire?
[02:18:54.864 --> 02:19:03.168]  We need to put pressure on the moderate Republicans and as many Democrats as we can.
[02:19:04.489 --> 02:19:07.430]  The Republican caucus is now firmly behind us.
[02:19:08.971 --> 02:19:11.072]  This is the Republican position.
[02:19:11.612 --> 02:19:20.556]  So, you know, we've probably got 90 to 95 percent of the caucus fairly well secure.
[02:19:21.657 --> 02:19:23.698]  We've got a few people that, you know,
[02:19:24.739 --> 02:19:26.599]  Oh, it's just too complicated.
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:30.720]  You know, I don't understand it, kind of responses.
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:35.061]  And they've got to know that this is what the people want.
[02:19:35.781 --> 02:19:38.382]  And the people are going to take notice.
[02:19:38.642 --> 02:19:46.184]  They're going to go back and look at this vote and decide who they're going to try and remove from office, based at least in part on this vote.
[02:19:46.484 --> 02:19:48.024]  How many Democrats do you need to get?
[02:19:50.207 --> 02:19:54.711]  Well, if it were perfect attendance, which it never is, we're a body of 400.
[02:19:55.171 --> 02:19:57.774]  The Republicans hold 178 seats.
[02:19:58.614 --> 02:20:05.280]  So if everybody attended, we would need to get 23 reps, because we need 201 votes.
[02:20:08.163 --> 02:20:11.566]  We typically, rather than having 400 in attendance, we have 350 to 380.
[02:20:14.987 --> 02:20:18.875]  Uh, Paul can correct me, but I think that's a good general expectation for attendance.
[02:20:18.995 --> 02:20:21.079]  So you're saying you're close to getting this done?
[02:20:21.886 --> 02:20:22.726]  We're close.
[02:20:23.167 --> 02:20:25.128]  It is definitely an achievable goal.
[02:20:25.368 --> 02:20:35.453]  And I want to be specific here though, as the globalists crack down on the New World Order, World Banking System, Old World Order Banking System is openly being announced, you may not succeed this time, you'll succeed the second or third try.
[02:20:35.634 --> 02:20:36.734]  That's what they always do to us.
[02:20:36.794 --> 02:20:41.657]  We have to persevere, we have to continue, and it just gets bigger.
[02:20:41.677 --> 02:20:50.502]  You have to realize by the rules of the New Hampshire House, if we don't catch it now, we're done until two years from now.
[02:20:52.338 --> 02:20:53.118]  So we need to do it now.
[02:20:53.358 --> 02:20:54.379]  People need to call everybody.
[02:20:54.399 --> 02:20:54.699]  Stay there.
[02:20:54.719 --> 02:21:00.301]  I want to come back to you and then to the other representative, Paul Ingbertson, because this is important, folks.
[02:21:00.821 --> 02:21:02.802]  Every state is vitally important.
[02:21:02.822 --> 02:21:07.764]  This will set precedence and send shockwaves throughout the nation.
[02:21:08.104 --> 02:21:09.845]  We are going to get states to pass this.
[02:21:10.285 --> 02:21:12.446]  This is key in the fight against the globalists.
[02:21:12.466 --> 02:21:12.946]  Stay with us.
[02:21:13.666 --> 02:21:14.567]  We're on the march.
[02:21:15.047 --> 02:21:16.667]  The empire's on the run.
[02:21:17.588 --> 02:21:20.269]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:23.723 --> 02:21:26.665]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:21:26.825 --> 02:21:32.068]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:21:32.348 --> 02:21:37.691]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:21:38.072 --> 02:21:39.172]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:39.553 --> 02:21:48.458]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:21:48.858 --> 02:21:50.480]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:54.865]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[02:21:54.905 --> 02:21:59.530]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[02:22:03.755 --> 02:22:04.535]  Keep it natural.

[02:22:18.458 --> 02:22:22.419]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:22:23.539 --> 02:22:29.940]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:22:30.301 --> 02:22:31.981]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:22:32.938 --> 02:22:33.959]  But who is the enemy?
[02:22:34.499 --> 02:22:35.000]  Bin Laden.
[02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:36.001]  This is his M.O.
[02:22:36.101 --> 02:22:37.582]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:22:37.602 --> 02:22:39.344]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:22:39.644 --> 02:22:46.410]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:22:46.810 --> 02:22:47.251]  Some U.S.
[02:22:47.291 --> 02:22:52.916]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:53.616 --> 02:22:57.078]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:57.098 --> 02:22:59.280]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:23:23.487 --> 02:23:25.749]  Right now the world is a scary place.
[02:23:25.969 --> 02:23:31.172]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[02:23:31.412 --> 02:23:35.815]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[02:23:35.995 --> 02:23:38.757]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[02:23:38.877 --> 02:23:48.664]  The First Line of Defense Kit includes Nutri-Immune and Nutri-Defense, providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry, and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[02:23:48.884 --> 02:23:53.387]  Also included, the Nano-Mask Nano-Particular Antiviral Masks with replacement
[02:23:53.387 --> 02:23:53.727]  I think so.
[02:24:52.478 --> 02:24:58.123]  Alright, we are back live in a few more minutes with the state representatives and I'm going to get into some more news on the finance end.
[02:24:58.223 --> 02:25:03.087]  The stock market plunging even more today, now down to $6,763 right now and dropping.
[02:25:08.769 --> 02:25:09.549]  Just amazing.
[02:25:09.929 --> 02:25:13.190]  Before we go any further with our guest, I want to tell you about a new sponsor we have.
[02:25:13.210 --> 02:25:14.891]  Again, we check out every sponsor.
[02:25:14.931 --> 02:25:15.971]  We believe in our sponsors.
[02:25:16.051 --> 02:25:20.333]  Everything we bring you is something that I think is a great idea and a good system.
[02:25:20.853 --> 02:25:23.954]  And it's Pmemory, just the letter P and then memory.
[02:25:24.294 --> 02:25:25.894]  Pmemory.com.
[02:25:26.315 --> 02:25:30.516]  Knowledge is power and your ability to learn and retain information is fully based on your attention and memory.
[02:25:30.996 --> 02:25:37.199]  This is why the elite is using all possible ways to dumb people down through brain-damaging chemicals, drugs, and even educational systems.
[02:25:37.259 --> 02:25:42.902]  Yeah, the television, the way the programming is set up in the commercials lowers your attention span.
[02:25:43.302 --> 02:25:46.624]  ADHD, memory loss, and learning disorders make learning a struggle and waste.
[02:25:47.384 --> 02:25:48.065]  Time and money.
[02:25:48.966 --> 02:25:51.509]  How much information can you recall from the last radio show?
[02:25:51.969 --> 02:25:53.110]  How about three weeks back?
[02:25:53.491 --> 02:25:58.576]  Unfortunately, you cannot improve your mental abilities by taking drugs, supplements or by reading self-help books.
[02:25:59.077 --> 02:26:04.442]  It's all an illusion and useless as trying to get in shape by just reading a book on bodybuilding.
[02:26:05.063 --> 02:26:09.804]  To get a good result, you need real complex solutions based on science and practical training.
[02:26:10.484 --> 02:26:14.165]  School of Phenomenal Memory is not about marginal improvement.
[02:26:14.205 --> 02:26:23.786]  It's about having super strong attention and focus, mental stamina, accelerated speed of thought, and, of course, the real phenomenon of memory.
[02:26:24.447 --> 02:26:31.068]  When you can memorize anything fast and effectively, including entire books, go to pmemory.net.
[02:26:31.108 --> 02:26:32.208]  pmemory.net now.
[02:26:33.925 --> 02:26:42.356]  and read hundreds of testimonials download free e-book explaining how memory really works and get ten percent off by mentioning myself Alex Jones.
[02:26:42.376 --> 02:26:47.482]  That's pmemory.net or pmemory.com pmemory.net the letter p memory dot net.
[02:26:47.923 --> 02:26:50.606]  Okay let's go ahead now and go back to Representative
[02:26:51.407 --> 02:26:57.651]  Dan, it's of New Hampshire and Representative Paul Ingreston of New Hampshire as well.
[02:26:58.692 --> 02:26:59.553]  What about you, Paul?
[02:27:00.153 --> 02:27:01.854]  You didn't get a chance to speak during the last segment.
[02:27:01.894 --> 02:27:06.997]  Other comments or thoughts on how important this fight in New Hampshire is that's coming up?
[02:27:07.018 --> 02:27:08.138]  We're having a rally tomorrow.
[02:27:08.178 --> 02:27:09.259]  When are we going to see this vote?
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:14.783]  Well, first off, you asked me, the way you started that question was about how important this is.
[02:27:14.843 --> 02:27:16.964]  I can tell you very simply how important this is.
[02:27:17.004 --> 02:27:19.746]  I met this morning with about 20 conservatives.
[02:27:20.367 --> 02:27:25.911]  In their own little caucus, where they analyze bills for the next day and all that sort of thing.
[02:27:26.672 --> 02:27:36.039]  And I asked, could I get their agreement to negotiate some of their votes for certain close bills that Democrats want in return for Democrat votes on this bill?
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:39.042]  And the response to me was extremely positive.
[02:27:39.942 --> 02:27:41.844]  So just to give you an idea, that's how important it is to me.
[02:27:41.884 --> 02:27:42.925]  I don't like making deals.
[02:27:42.965 --> 02:27:45.827]  Democrats bill almost 90%, 99% of them.
[02:27:47.028 --> 02:27:49.150]  I consider it to be too much government, it's more government, etc.
[02:27:50.596 --> 02:27:51.977]  This bill is worth a whole lot.
[02:27:52.078 --> 02:27:56.501]  This is one of those moments when even a Republican conservative constitutionalist is willing to make a deal.
[02:27:56.561 --> 02:28:03.106]  And I'd like any of your listeners who are from New Hampshire to make contact with their Democrat representatives and tell them that, if they haven't heard from me already.
[02:28:04.748 --> 02:28:05.729]  Well, absolutely.
[02:28:05.749 --> 02:28:10.072]  I mean, some people don't realize how politics works around the country.
[02:28:10.092 --> 02:28:17.058]  If we can get New Hampshire and other states to actually pass these strong resolutions, this makes or breaks really the future of this movement, doesn't it?
[02:28:19.008 --> 02:28:25.671]  Well, it's the beginning of something politically, but the fact is we don't know how much time we have with the way things are progressing here.
[02:28:26.332 --> 02:28:28.673]  The usurpation is just increasing, increasing.
[02:28:28.833 --> 02:28:29.453]  It's dramatic.
[02:28:30.034 --> 02:28:31.314]  People aren't even reading bills anymore.
[02:28:31.454 --> 02:28:34.456]  You know, the stimulus package is outrageous, but it's been going on for some time.
[02:28:34.496 --> 02:28:35.877]  The Patriot Act, how many people read that?
[02:28:36.417 --> 02:28:36.837]  And so on.
[02:28:36.877 --> 02:28:39.459]  The IMF, you know, the Gap, the Baptist stuff.
[02:28:39.519 --> 02:28:41.400]  I mean, these things have been crammed down our throats.
[02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:47.403]  And every time you turn around, it's at the loss of our rights and the state's powers.
[02:28:49.715 --> 02:28:51.316]  We don't know what we're doing right there.
[02:28:51.376 --> 02:28:56.737]  There's definitely an agenda of some kind, or these things wouldn't keep on going, as Jefferson said, in exactly the same direction.
[02:28:58.298 --> 02:28:59.318]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:28:59.358 --> 02:29:01.939]  Representative Inslee, your comments on what he was just saying.
[02:29:02.659 --> 02:29:04.959]  Well, I agree with Paul entirely.
[02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:06.680]  You asked when the vote is.
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:08.180]  The vote is tomorrow.
[02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:13.962]  So, you know, there is no second bite at the apple.
[02:29:14.482 --> 02:29:17.563]  Tomorrow is the hill to die on.
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:26.603]  If we're going to do it this year, certainly it's tomorrow, and probably if we're going to do it this term, it's tomorrow.
[02:29:27.203 --> 02:29:37.908]  We might be able to craft something sufficiently different to bring in next year, but it would be likely to be blocked by the leadership.
[02:29:40.089 --> 02:29:41.490]  It's now or never, guys.
[02:29:42.330 --> 02:29:44.211]  We do have access to the Senate.
[02:29:44.651 --> 02:29:48.793]  We could do it through the Senate, virtually the same bill, if not exactly the same bill, if we actually wanted to.
[02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:53.612]  If you could find enough Senators to actually pass it, I think we have a better chance in the House the first time around.
[02:29:54.713 --> 02:29:57.715]  Well, the hard part would be finding a Senator to bring it in.
[02:29:57.995 --> 02:30:02.518]  I mean, we could bring in the same bill to the Senate, but you'd have to have a Senator that would support it.
[02:30:03.478 --> 02:30:06.100]  And that's not going to be so easy.
[02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:08.381]  Yeah, we just lost the Senator that was supporting it.
[02:30:08.421 --> 02:30:09.402]  We lost it to the House.
[02:30:09.462 --> 02:30:10.423]  He's gone.
[02:30:12.904 --> 02:30:19.288]  And so, you know, it's really important that people get on their phones, get up to the State House,
[02:30:20.168 --> 02:30:30.745]  And make the legislators know that their future as a legislator depends on their vote on this bill, this resolution.
[02:30:33.267 --> 02:30:34.328]  Absolutely, man.
[02:30:34.788 --> 02:30:38.251]  Anything else you think is important to add about what we're facing here?
[02:30:38.291 --> 02:30:50.639]  I mean, I think restating the fact, does it even amaze you guys to see them openly in hundreds of publications admitting world government of and by central bankers and that they will rule the planet and that we'll pay carbon taxes to them?
[02:30:51.279 --> 02:30:56.183]  And then they pose this as if they are the saviors when they openly and publicly engineered all of this?
[02:30:56.203 --> 02:31:01.686]  I mean, it's just the bravado, the chutzpah, the arrogance, the...
[02:31:03.407 --> 02:31:10.572]  It's arrogance, and it's a belief in a, well, I'd say a divine right to rule.
[02:31:10.892 --> 02:31:22.179]  And what we jettisoned here in America in 1776 was the whole idea of divine right to rule.
[02:31:22.559 --> 02:31:28.583]  That somehow the right to rule was imbued to somebody by their genetics.
[02:31:30.184 --> 02:31:39.707]  Our Constitution states, in fact, that blood and family cannot impute the qualities necessary for good governance.
[02:31:40.688 --> 02:31:44.609]  And yet, also, on the other hand, Alex, you know, it's very clear that they fear the people.
[02:31:45.249 --> 02:31:51.571]  And the people, in an informed public, that begins to rise like this, has tremendous power.
[02:31:52.071 --> 02:31:53.031]  Just tremendous power.
[02:31:53.311 --> 02:31:57.973]  And you don't know where these people are in their plans, but, you know, they've been a long time very furtively working.
[02:31:59.059 --> 02:32:03.141]  This is a historical moment for us.
[02:32:03.542 --> 02:32:13.547]  If I'm speaking to the people that are out there in your audience that support this bill, particularly those in New Hampshire, where my concern is, believe in yourselves.
[02:32:14.007 --> 02:32:14.928]  We're your servants.
[02:32:14.988 --> 02:32:18.290]  We're doing this on your behalf.
[02:32:19.451 --> 02:32:21.972]  This requires your participation.
[02:32:22.432 --> 02:32:27.315]  The Constitution of the state of New Hampshire requires really three things.
[02:32:27.625 --> 02:32:28.866]  From the people of New Hampshire.
[02:32:28.926 --> 02:32:34.151]  First, it requires that they pay taxes in return for protection of their life, liberty, and property.
[02:32:35.092 --> 02:32:40.197]  It then requires that they know their constitution and enforce them upon the government.
[02:32:40.978 --> 02:32:49.106]  And if they are unable to enforce the constitution for whatever reason, then it is their duty to reform or replace the government.
[02:32:49.525 --> 02:32:51.286]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:32:51.786 --> 02:33:12.396]  You know, just in closing, did you guys hear about Virginia counties, where in one county they took, Prince William County, they took $50 million of taxpayer money, and they bought positions and mortgages, and they're basically giving the houses at half off, and then paying the city employees and county employees to move into people's repossessed houses.
[02:33:13.319 --> 02:33:13.980]  Good Lord!
[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:16.241]  I mean, it's really becoming insane.
[02:33:16.662 --> 02:33:18.523]  I mean, I'm in a... There's a pattern of usurpation, Alex.
[02:33:18.603 --> 02:33:21.906]  There's a pattern of usurpation is what is leading to all this stuff.
[02:33:22.186 --> 02:33:23.047]  They've created a pattern.
[02:33:23.067 --> 02:33:26.430]  We're not resisting it on all levels, executive, legislative, and judicial.
[02:33:27.050 --> 02:33:27.911]  We're doing it in the states.
[02:33:28.011 --> 02:33:31.113]  Our own state Supreme Court's usurping, like in the Claremont decision in New Hampshire.
[02:33:31.133 --> 02:33:32.194]  This is pure usurpation.
[02:33:32.234 --> 02:33:41.962]  I just found a wonderful quote from an old New York newspaper, where it expressly says that they're beginning to think that the state should take over public education, where Claremont said we always had it.
[02:33:42.659 --> 02:33:46.981]  So we're talking about usurpation as a pattern now, and they've all followed the model.
[02:33:47.202 --> 02:33:48.562]  They got the pet of the model.
[02:33:49.503 --> 02:33:56.107]  The judiciary, in the last ten years, twice, has patently violated the Constitution.
[02:33:57.067 --> 02:34:07.093]  And we need a legislature that will stand up and hold the judiciary accountable and remove them when they violate the Constitution.
[02:34:08.071 --> 02:34:12.629]  They can't be left to interpret the Constitution because who holds them accountable when they violate it?
[02:34:13.412 --> 02:34:13.794]  Absolutely.
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:24.244]  All right, well, men, I want to thank both of you for joining us today, and God willing, this will pass tomorrow, but God helps those that help themselves.
[02:34:24.865 --> 02:34:31.888]  The better one is saying, trust in God, but tie up your camel, or as Hunter S. Thompson said, yeah, pray to God, but also row away from the rocks.
[02:34:33.789 --> 02:34:42.034]  Everybody needs to call the New Hampshire legislature, the House, right now, especially the Democrats and the Republicans.
[02:34:42.134 --> 02:34:44.435]  Any names you want to list that people really need to hammer?
[02:34:46.038 --> 02:34:50.720]  No, I couldn't list a name, but there's 400 members of this house, you know, and you'd be hard-pressed to do that.
[02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:52.641]  I certainly could call Speaker Norelli, though.
[02:34:52.681 --> 02:34:54.041]  That's a name that everybody remembers.
[02:34:54.461 --> 02:34:54.821]  All right.
[02:34:54.881 --> 02:34:55.602]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:34:55.622 --> 02:34:56.482]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:34:56.502 --> 02:34:57.122]  Godspeed.
[02:34:57.142 --> 02:34:58.003]  Okay.
[02:34:58.023 --> 02:34:58.803]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:34:58.823 --> 02:34:59.363]  God bless you.
[02:34:59.743 --> 02:35:00.083]  All right.
[02:35:00.124 --> 02:35:01.544]  Great to hear from those gentlemen.
[02:35:02.344 --> 02:35:04.185]  I'm looking at the stock market now.
[02:35:04.225 --> 02:35:08.287]  In fact, I'm refreshing it because it's coming up to its close here in about 15 minutes.
[02:35:11.368 --> 02:35:11.888]  It is down to 6,763.
[02:35:11.928 --> 02:35:12.369]  The Dow is at 6,763.
[02:35:12.429 --> 02:35:14.390]  Down 41 points after 300 points down yesterday.
[02:35:14.410 --> 02:35:15.630]  Or 999 if you want to be technical.
[02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:16.291]  But it's down right now 41.09.
[02:35:32.675 --> 02:35:35.999]  And you know, the bankers may pump it back up later, but they're just going to drop it.
[02:35:36.099 --> 02:35:37.781]  I mean, if you watch the graph, it's going down.
[02:35:38.461 --> 02:35:41.725]  It spikes back up, but it's only on its way down, like bouncing down a cliff.
[02:35:43.367 --> 02:35:47.451]  And they have engineered this, and they are stealing all the real wealth and real investments.
[02:35:47.851 --> 02:35:50.414]  They have destroyed confidence by design to do this.
[02:35:51.355 --> 02:35:52.696]  Just outrageous.
[02:35:54.207 --> 02:36:01.272]  Now I guess it's up to half of people's savings through the stock market and through different 401ks and mutual funds has been taken.
[02:36:01.893 --> 02:36:03.214]  That's on average half the wealth.
[02:36:03.234 --> 02:36:04.855]  Some people have lost more, some have lost less.
[02:36:04.995 --> 02:36:07.017]  Some portfolios I've seen have lost upwards of 80%.
[02:36:07.837 --> 02:36:09.698]  Some people have lost it all with companies that went under.
[02:36:10.299 --> 02:36:18.805]  And all that real wealth was transferred out the back door before the bankers implode these institutions.
[02:36:24.292 --> 02:36:25.854]  So, very, very serious there.
[02:36:28.196 --> 02:36:30.258]  Here's a Washington Times headline, I'll go through a few of these.
[02:36:30.618 --> 02:36:32.860]  Obama's state secrets echo Bush.
[02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:47.673]  Last year Britain's Foreign Office arranged and angered the British High Court by ordering it to censor seven paragraphs from a previous ruling in the case of a British legal resident who had been rendered, had been kidnapped and tortured by the CIA in Afghanistan.
[02:36:48.649 --> 02:36:54.013]  And then it just goes into how Obama has now done the same thing, protecting Bush on that front.
[02:36:54.033 --> 02:36:57.735]  I don't have time to play this, but it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:36:58.035 --> 02:36:59.076]  Kurt Nimmo did a story on it.
[02:36:59.376 --> 02:37:02.598]  Glenn Beck mentions FEMA camps on Fox and Friends.
[02:37:07.085 --> 02:37:13.447]  It goes on here, where, if you watch what Beck says, he mentions these things, but then acts like, well, maybe it's kind of needed.
[02:37:13.527 --> 02:37:16.548]  Oh, it's scary, but the Bubba's, the Bubba's are dangerous.
[02:37:16.588 --> 02:37:17.228]  What are we going to do?
[02:37:17.248 --> 02:37:19.269]  So, open announcements of FEMA camps on the news.
[02:37:19.829 --> 02:37:23.170]  Gerald Cilente, we're going to get back on in the next few weeks, top trends forecaster.
[02:37:23.390 --> 02:37:25.090]  He's also in the Obama deception, I should add.
[02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:32.173]  Along with George Humphrey, Webster Tarpley, Jesse Ventura, KRS-One, and others.
[02:37:32.953 --> 02:37:34.053]  Cilente, U.S.
[02:37:34.093 --> 02:37:36.554]  has entered the greatest depression.
[02:37:37.964 --> 02:37:46.712]  Trends Research Analyst Gerald Cilente, who has risen in promise on the back of his deadly accurate economic prediction, says that the collapse of financial markets heralds the start of the Greatest Depression.
[02:37:47.212 --> 02:37:53.718]  In his latest Trend Alert Bulletin, Cilente attacks mainstream pundits who falsely predicted the market bottom and the start of the recovery.
[02:37:54.398 --> 02:37:57.420]  Noting that conventional analysts have been proven wrong over and over again.
[02:37:57.460 --> 02:37:59.582]  Yeah, they're about 80% wrong on average because they're lying.
[02:38:00.142 --> 02:38:02.684]  There will be no turnaround in the second quarter of 2009 or 2010 or 2011.
[02:38:02.744 --> 02:38:18.774]  The global financial system built on endless supplies of cheap money, rampant speculation, fraud, greed and delusion is terminally ill and will not be coaxed into remission by stimulus packages nor restored to health by government buyouts and bailouts, writes Salente.
[02:38:19.255 --> 02:38:23.958]  And then he went through that there's going to be real panic setting in in the next six months to a year.
[02:38:25.499 --> 02:38:26.519]  And it goes on and on.
[02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:32.502]  The most positive prediction that Celente makes is the Dow will not reach zero.
[02:38:32.542 --> 02:38:38.645]  A tongue-in-cheek reaction to yesterday's record plunge, which saw the Dow roll back to 1997 levels of below 7,000.
[02:38:38.845 --> 02:38:43.787]  Celente warns that the first signs of real panic are starting to set in.
[02:38:43.907 --> 02:38:50.891]  Unrest will cause governments to take draconian measures to prevent total economic collapse and public panic, which is what they want.
[02:38:51.678 --> 02:38:54.178]  Folks, we saw gold in the last couple months go from $780-something an ounce to $1,000-plus.
[02:39:21.530 --> 02:39:23.752]  Then it went back down to $9.30 or so.
[02:39:24.332 --> 02:39:26.974]  That is a massive buying opportunity.
[02:39:27.395 --> 02:39:29.877]  Whether gold goes up or down, it's got real intrinsic value.
[02:39:29.917 --> 02:39:30.878]  They're killing the dollar.
[02:39:30.898 --> 02:39:32.419]  They're devaluing everything.
[02:39:32.939 --> 02:39:34.321]  And I haven't had Ted on in about a week.
[02:39:34.361 --> 02:39:36.863]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up right now because Ted
[02:39:37.523 --> 02:39:37.863]  I sure will.
[02:39:37.883 --> 02:39:38.724]  Alex, I can tell you right now,
[02:40:06.776 --> 02:40:10.823]  Uh, in my 30 years of experience tells me that I need to be a buyer right now.
[02:40:11.183 --> 02:40:14.529]  I need to get into the marketplace at the prices that there are right now.
[02:40:14.949 --> 02:40:16.812]  I may see a couple little lower prices.
[02:40:16.872 --> 02:40:18.455]  I don't know where it's going to go exactly.
[02:40:18.868 --> 02:40:23.189]  But if I'm going to be on the right side of the market, I have to be moving in when other people are moving out.
[02:40:23.229 --> 02:40:28.551]  Well, we know they admittedly are in the Comex trying to drive it down with paper gold, and that's even threatening more of a default.
[02:40:28.571 --> 02:40:30.352]  They can't hold the beach ball down forever.
[02:40:30.592 --> 02:40:30.852]  No.
[02:40:30.892 --> 02:40:32.433]  It just surged.
[02:40:32.733 --> 02:40:36.874]  What they're trying to do is they're trying to put a floor on the losses of a fiat currency.
[02:40:37.278 --> 02:40:44.828]  And you've got to realize they've got to beat up the real valuable things really hard in order to support this fiat currency that they have out there.
[02:40:45.129 --> 02:40:46.110]  And it isn't going to work.
[02:40:46.631 --> 02:40:52.519]  Just give it a little bit of time and we're going to have a bunch more bad news and that gold and silver is going to come up like a
[02:40:52.918 --> 02:40:56.180]  Like you said, a beach ball being held underwater.
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:00.343]  You can't do it for very long, and it comes back with a vengeance when it does.
[02:41:00.583 --> 02:41:02.904]  Regardless, look at a year graph.
[02:41:03.224 --> 02:41:07.027]  Google a year gold graph, and gold's going straight up, folks.
[02:41:07.067 --> 02:41:08.187]  Look at the five-year graph.
[02:41:08.227 --> 02:41:09.188]  Look at the six-year graph.
[02:41:09.228 --> 02:41:10.269]  It's going straight up.
[02:41:10.529 --> 02:41:11.429]  Look at the stock market.
[02:41:11.469 --> 02:41:12.650]  It's going straight down.
[02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:16.252]  Don't look at week-to-week, month-to-month even, at the stock market.
[02:41:16.492 --> 02:41:19.494]  Look at it in a year graph, a two-year graph, a three-year graph.
[02:41:19.574 --> 02:41:20.835]  Look at what it's doing
[02:41:21.215 --> 02:41:22.635]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's going down.
[02:41:22.755 --> 02:41:24.376]  Gold and silver is going up.
[02:41:24.676 --> 02:41:26.457]  And it's one of the only commodities that's going up.
[02:41:26.497 --> 02:41:30.338]  With oil, you know, down at $35-$40 a barrel, it's been as low as $33.
[02:41:30.778 --> 02:41:33.879]  Folks need to move into gold and silver right now, don't they, Ted?
[02:41:33.899 --> 02:41:34.799]  They sure do.
[02:41:35.019 --> 02:41:37.220]  I mean, there was such a bloodbath yesterday, Alex.
[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:38.360]  I mean, the market is just...
[02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:40.863]  Having the jitters and it's just beginning.
[02:41:41.203 --> 02:41:42.485]  That thing is going to come down more.
[02:41:42.525 --> 02:41:43.306]  We all know that.
[02:41:43.466 --> 02:41:48.152]  People are running into treasury bonds, which are total crud, when they don't even get a return on them.
[02:41:48.552 --> 02:41:50.495]  I mean, look at gold and silver, folks.
[02:41:50.575 --> 02:41:52.076]  Look at how it's performing.
[02:41:52.677 --> 02:41:54.860]  Yeah, gold has been doing way better than cash.
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:55.641]  Way better.
[02:41:55.681 --> 02:41:57.063]  You can't even hardly compare the two.
[02:41:57.659 --> 02:42:04.625]  Gold has been, I mean, it's up, it's up 300% and the value of the currency isn't even, you know, coming close to that kind of a return.

[02:45:36.154 --> 02:45:39.555]  That's coming up at the start of the retransmission on InfoWars.com.
[02:45:39.596 --> 02:45:42.497]  And again, Jason Burma's tonight, 9 to midnight Central Time.
[02:45:42.557 --> 02:45:45.017]  That's 10 to 1 a.m., 10 p.m.
[02:45:45.057 --> 02:45:45.558]  to 1 a.m.
[02:45:45.638 --> 02:45:45.938]  Eastern.
[02:45:47.218 --> 02:45:51.119]  7 to 10 Pacific, 8 to 11 Mountain.
[02:45:51.619 --> 02:45:52.280]  Jason Burmiss.
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:54.820]  The show's called Jason Burmiss, the Info Warrior.
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:56.721]  And that is like a superhero.
[02:45:57.101 --> 02:46:00.762]  He even does a show, a little cape on and a Batman outfit.
[02:46:00.842 --> 02:46:02.062]  I'm joking, having some fun, folks.
[02:46:02.782 --> 02:46:06.183]  And I'm up here working a lot at night, so sometimes I'll be popping in on the show as well.
[02:46:06.603 --> 02:46:08.824]  Ted, give folks today a gold and silver offer.
[02:46:09.224 --> 02:46:11.826]  Yeah, right today we have the Frank at $2.20.
[02:46:11.946 --> 02:46:17.129]  Now Alex, you've got to remember the Frank was at $2.42 just on February 18th.
[02:46:17.650 --> 02:46:21.252]  I also have the British Sovereign, right now it's $2.75.
[02:46:21.692 --> 02:46:25.535]  That same coin, that on the 18th was $2.95.80.
[02:46:25.975 --> 02:46:30.398]  To give you a little bit of an example of what we have right now and the prices.
[02:46:30.418 --> 02:46:32.999]  The nice part about it, in stock, ready to go.
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:35.621]  What I also have is I have about 35 bags
[02:46:37.375 --> 02:46:43.699]  of Franklin Haves, and I suggest that if anybody's going to be getting involved in the silver, take advantage of this offer.
[02:46:43.799 --> 02:46:51.083]  Because they're here, they're in stock, so many dealers are so short in supply that they're going to try to put off the order in delivery.
[02:46:51.523 --> 02:46:52.964]  I do have these right here stored.
[02:46:52.984 --> 02:46:54.925]  And for those that don't know, most people are sold out.
[02:46:54.965 --> 02:46:59.288]  They're putting huge premiums on it, not discounts like Ted is doing right now.
[02:46:59.408 --> 02:47:01.889]  Those silver haves are gorgeous coins.
[02:47:02.210 --> 02:47:04.291]  That's the most of the silver that I've bought has been that coin.
[02:47:04.929 --> 02:47:09.234]  Well, anyways, right now they're currently at $173.80 per roll of 20.
[02:47:10.455 --> 02:47:13.119]  You can pick up bags of them if you want to, because I really did.
[02:47:13.139 --> 02:47:14.600]  What does that boil down to per coin?
[02:47:14.861 --> 02:47:18.425]  It comes right down to $8.69 per coin.
[02:47:18.705 --> 02:47:19.506]  So that's a great deal.
[02:47:19.526 --> 02:47:20.888]  You're not going to find a better one out there.
[02:47:20.908 --> 02:47:21.668]  I challenge you to 800-686-8000.
[02:47:23.971 --> 02:47:24.412]  We're good to go.
[02:47:45.572 --> 02:47:47.413]  Well, I'd say 90 plus percent out there aren't.
[02:47:48.413 --> 02:47:57.076]  It's also a guy that owns the Genesis Network and finances everything we're doing here, so it's a win-win, win-win, win-win, win-win, win-win, 800-686-2237.
[02:47:57.656 --> 02:47:58.276]  Anything else, Ted?
[02:47:58.296 --> 02:48:02.977]  No, I just want to say, I mean, right now, just watch the markets, because there's so much going on.
[02:48:03.357 --> 02:48:05.978]  I mean, this AIG thing is just scratching the surface.
[02:48:06.298 --> 02:48:08.359]  I mean, Barack Obama wants to go in and buy up
[02:48:09.113 --> 02:48:13.315]  Yeah, like I said, you can't solve a debt problem, and that's what we have right now.
[02:48:13.335 --> 02:48:14.356]  We've got way too much debt.
[02:48:28.735 --> 02:48:30.036]  By going further into debt.
[02:48:30.056 --> 02:48:35.438]  And that's what the... I don't know how anybody can trust the system to leave most of their money in the banks.
[02:48:35.518 --> 02:48:36.399]  Hedge your bets, folks.
[02:48:36.439 --> 02:48:37.319]  Get into gold and silver.
[02:48:37.799 --> 02:48:39.700]  The best investment out there, Barnard.
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:40.741]  800-686-2237.
[02:48:40.781 --> 02:48:42.361]  Ted, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:48:42.641 --> 02:48:43.762]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:48:44.042 --> 02:48:44.402]  You bet.
[02:48:44.422 --> 02:48:44.662]  800-686-2237.
[02:48:45.443 --> 02:48:47.064]  Okay, this story.
[02:48:47.104 --> 02:48:48.444]  I'm going to get more into this tomorrow.
[02:48:48.464 --> 02:48:49.925]  We're working on getting some guests on.
[02:48:50.365 --> 02:48:56.989]  Yeah, it was a major university study at Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine conducted several studies.
[02:48:57.569 --> 02:49:01.991]  One to determine the vaccines can cause changes in immune system of dogs that might lead to life-threatening immune
[02:49:04.232 --> 02:49:05.073]  Mediated Diseases.
[02:49:05.313 --> 02:49:08.336]  They conducted this research because concern already existed.
[02:49:08.396 --> 02:49:14.902]  It was sponsored by the Haywood Foundation, which itself was looking for evidence that such changes in human immune systems might also be vaccine-related.
[02:49:16.003 --> 02:49:23.150]  And it just goes on here to talk about the amount of dogs and cats that get cancers in the area where they were injected.
[02:49:23.170 --> 02:49:26.874]  They've already proven the implantable microchips were doing this.
[02:49:29.236 --> 02:49:32.584]  Oh man, this study is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:49:33.787 --> 02:49:34.468]  We're going to...
[02:49:35.902 --> 02:49:42.146]  We're going to be getting some guests on about this and getting into more detail from this here on the show.
[02:49:42.387 --> 02:49:45.349]  So look for that, because they won't do a lot of studies with vaccines in humans.
[02:49:45.369 --> 02:49:46.670]  We know it's bad and killing people.
[02:49:46.690 --> 02:49:47.951]  I mean, that's been admitted.
[02:49:48.251 --> 02:49:53.455]  But with animals, they have a group where they can really test it out and watch it, because their lifespans aren't as long, so it's more detailed.
[02:49:53.955 --> 02:49:55.676]  Retransmission starts right now.
[02:49:55.696 --> 02:49:59.499]  We'll be back in 70 seconds at Infowars.com on the streams and the free podcast.
[02:49:59.519 --> 02:50:00.460]  Be sure to download that.
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:02.141]  We'll be back tomorrow live, 11 to 3.
[02:50:02.401 --> 02:50:03.622]  And Burma's comes up tonight, 9 o'clock.
[02:50:05.216 --> 02:50:07.281]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:50:13.387 --> 02:50:14.948]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:50:15.088 --> 02:50:19.692]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:50:19.812 --> 02:50:22.574]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:50:22.794 --> 02:50:25.636]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:50:25.836 --> 02:50:31.720]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family, in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[02:50:31.921 --> 02:50:34.843]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:50:35.163 --> 02:50:42.048]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
