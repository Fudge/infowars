[00:00:00.803 --> 00:00:06.427]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:18.356]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we have one hour and fifty-two minutes left in transmission.
[00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:25.101]  We are now simulcasting the remainder of this radio show in living color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:26.161]  Here it is!
[00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.827]  This is the classic Obama socialism shirt.
[00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.909]  And on the back, this one just says InfoWars.com.
[00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.332]  We have handsome black shirts with this image, really stands out.
[00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:41.713]  I'm going to wear one of those tomorrow or next week on air.
[00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:46.616]  We have it with Obama fascist, ObamaInfoWars.com, Obama New World Order.
[00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:49.477]  On the back, we have different variants, eight different shirts.
[00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:53.159]  Wake up before it's too late, end the feds, stop the criminal.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.481]  You want to meet like-minded people.
[00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.450]  You want to get the word out.
[00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:06.172]  You want to get past the political correctness, because they're on the news saying this is now a hate crime.
[00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:11.974]  And if we give in to that and say, okay, it's a hate crime, I'm not allowed to show him in a bad light, then you've given in.
[00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:15.775]  It's the media and the government creating racism, invoking racism.
[00:01:18.424 --> 00:01:38.342]  And they're doing it cold-bloodedly as a political tool, saying, be politically correct, don't criticize Obama on anti-gun bills, on open borders, on socialized government medical care, takeover, really his eugenics, don't criticize him on cap-and-trade taxes, don't criticize him on abortion, nothing!
[00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:40.504]  Or you hate black people.
[00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:46.347]  And they've now said on MSNBC and CNN, socialism is now the n-word.
[00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:46.907]  It's a code.
[00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:48.928]  I mean, who would ever think of that?
[00:01:49.268 --> 00:01:50.529]  Now they know that's ridiculous.
[00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:52.890]  It is a chilling effect.
[00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.332]  So I just want the listeners, I want the viewers out there to stand up.
[00:01:57.352 --> 00:02:02.114]  You can print off the free flyers, put them up in public commons where other posters and things are posted.
[00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:09.958]  You know, I said this last week and I said this on Sunday and I said this in the rules of the contest, that, because I don't want you to get in trouble.
[00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:13.841]  You're doing it on your own, so I don't have any liability.
[00:02:14.162 --> 00:02:15.043]  But I don't want you to get in trouble.
[00:02:15.063 --> 00:02:17.788]  Don't stick it on federal buildings or mailboxes.
[00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:30.835]  Put it under windshields, put it in the Commons area, wherever you see other posters up, or polls, where everybody else puts posters up, it's selective enforcement and discrimination if they come after you.
[00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:32.977]  But I now have Florida newscast.
[00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:40.985]  I mean, I could have made the whole show today about myself, and I probably should, because, you know, we don't want them to try to demonize us nationally, as they're doing.
[00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:45.209]  And later, I'll get into that later in the hour, but I want to go to calls right now.
[00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:52.389]  They are saying that we're not allowed to post our posters anywhere and that it's a hate crime.
[00:02:52.789 --> 00:03:01.853]  But we found Obama in 2008 in the Washington Post and we have a copy of his letter saying put the Obama posters up on stop signs.
[00:03:02.693 --> 00:03:03.454]  We never said that.
[00:03:03.794 --> 00:03:07.195]  But see, he can say do that and he's good.
[00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:11.037]  But then we can't even say put this up on a light pole.
[00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:15.530]  And we've got stories out of Tennessee, and stories out of California.
[00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.131]  We have them up on Infowars.com.
[00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:19.132]  There's so many I can hardly even cover them all.
[00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:25.116]  Where they got the highway patrol going, it's dangerous to put these on a light pole.
[00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:27.377]  This could distract somebody and cause a wreck.
[00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:36.702]  So it's okay to have the lost dog, or the school event, or the police barbecue, or garage sales up on the pole.
[00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:41.065]  You just don't put a picture of God, that is Obama, up on there.
[00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.265]  The good news is I'm looking at TV stations all over the country and newspapers all over the country.
[00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:47.828]  You can just type Obama Joker.
[00:03:48.766 --> 00:04:06.459]  Go to Google News or StartPage.com and click on the News Search and you'll just see scores of articles and stories and where they're going, it's horrible, Alex Jones needs to be arrested, this is so un-American, it's disrespectful, it's illegal to talk about our president.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.301]  And then the comments, are you crazy?
[00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:09.482]  There's nothing more American.
[00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.244]  It was okay to show Bush as the Joker or as a vampire.
[00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:15.006]  I saw these bushes a monkey put up everywhere.
[00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:17.328]  I saw Bush as a vampire put up everywhere.
[00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:21.139]  And that was good, because Bush was a New World Order puppet.
[00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:26.704]  But I've always said, instead of just putting up Bush and Obama, let's put up David Rockefeller.
[00:04:26.844 --> 00:04:27.945]  Let's put up Ted Turner.
[00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:29.627]  Let's put up the real controllers.
[00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:32.209]  Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, the Queen of England.
[00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:36.233]  That's why I've done spoofs defiling the Queen of England.
[00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:37.374]  She's not my god.
[00:04:39.318 --> 00:04:41.060]  Everybody bowing down and worshipping her.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.682]  Our Founding Fathers burned effigies of the Royals.
[00:04:44.082 --> 00:04:45.323]  That's what America is.
[00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:47.805]  Not worshipping the Queen when she comes here.
[00:04:48.206 --> 00:04:53.630]  But the gateway to find out they're all puppets, and to get to the real elite, is InfoWars.com.
[00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:54.992]  And Obama.
[00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:58.775]  So you wear this shirt, get in their face, let them know you're an American.
[00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:00.617]  And they get in your face and say, I don't like that shirt.
[00:05:00.637 --> 00:05:01.978]  Say, oh but you liked it when it was Bush!
[00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:05.717]  And then explain to them, by the way, I'm not for Bush either.
[00:05:06.217 --> 00:05:10.941]  And I told my guys, we just got so busy getting these eight shirts made, I do want a George Bush.
[00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:17.466]  Just tell Janaya, our graphics girl, take the White House photo of Bush and make it look like this one.
[00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:20.088]  I want it, you know, same style, same look.
[00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:26.433]  I want to get a shirt up of that by tomorrow.
[00:05:26.453 --> 00:05:30.936]  We can put the order in tomorrow, we can have him here by Monday, our great guy that
[00:05:32.318 --> 00:05:34.039]  Makes these shirts for us up in New York.
[00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.101]  She does a fabulous job, made right here in the good ol' USA, and so we're gonna have a Bush one for you too.
[00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:47.843]  We're also doing one with Bush and Obama as vampires, drinking blood from the Statue of Liberty, to say they're both jokers.
[00:05:48.324 --> 00:05:49.444]  See, that's what it's all about.
[00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:54.197]  I'm going to give each caller a minute because I've got to get to people.
[00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:55.198]  I promise to take a lot of calls.
[00:05:55.218 --> 00:05:57.960]  We did a good job the first hour, decent hour the second hour.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.501]  I'm doing a terrible job now.
[00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:01.803]  Let's get to your calls and then I'm going to get to all the news.
[00:06:02.184 --> 00:06:07.448]  Democrat Representative Burton says, speaking your mind is an act of political terrorism.
[00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:10.196]  And that's what the hate speech law says.
[00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:13.498]  This is the Louisville Courier-Journal.
[00:06:13.718 --> 00:06:15.038]  I mean, this is mainstream news.
[00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:17.840]  They're saying speech is bad now.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.361]  Now, folks, I know it sounds extreme and radical, but it's not.
[00:06:20.982 --> 00:06:22.943]  In America, you used to have free speech.
[00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:26.945]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[00:06:27.305 --> 00:06:27.925]  That's key.
[00:06:28.285 --> 00:06:29.006]  That's coming up.
[00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:30.306]  That's up on Prison Planet.
[00:06:30.346 --> 00:06:33.548]  But right now, who's up next here first?
[00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.350]  Richard and P.A., you're on the air.
[00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.770]  Go ahead.
[00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:38.379]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.782]  A gentleman was on earlier and he said, uh, pray in the rosary.
[00:06:44.842 --> 00:06:48.424]  Well, my opinion is we ought to hold our politicians to the Ten Commandments.
[00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:49.925]  They are not being lived up to.
[00:06:51.666 --> 00:06:52.486]  I agree with you, sir.
[00:06:52.506 --> 00:06:53.426]  What else is on your mind?
[00:06:54.887 --> 00:06:56.128]  Uh, a lot.
[00:06:57.528 --> 00:06:59.689]  This health care deal is a bunch of crap.
[00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:06.913]  Uh, our government, I, well, my father, grandfather,
[00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:10.500]  And great-great-grandfather, all foot wars.
[00:07:11.744 --> 00:07:15.254]  And the way our government is going today, we're going to have one in the streets.
[00:07:19.568 --> 00:07:27.091]  Well, that could be the false flag, is that they know, again they've been building this police state up, building NORTHCOM up for decades.
[00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:29.731]  It didn't get set up in 2002, as we've been told.
[00:07:30.072 --> 00:07:31.072]  We have the government documents.
[00:07:31.112 --> 00:07:32.152]  Clinton gave speeches about it.
[00:07:32.432 --> 00:07:37.174]  They've been building this internal national police, this control grid, up to this point.
[00:07:37.534 --> 00:07:39.795]  Now they're launching all the crises at once.
[00:07:40.215 --> 00:07:41.976]  I think they want a violent revolution.
[00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:45.097]  They're probably going to stage terror attacks and say we did it.
[00:07:45.417 --> 00:07:48.398]  Now I've been predicting that if we saw the Southern Property Law Center and ADL
[00:07:49.258 --> 00:07:53.639]  Come out and start that script that it was a sure thing.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.860]  What started two days ago?
[00:07:57.221 --> 00:08:05.943]  Well, like I said, I think we ought to hold the politicians to the Ten Commandments and also use the Constitution to throw the bums out.
[00:08:07.344 --> 00:08:08.904]  I agree, and I appreciate your call.
[00:08:09.704 --> 00:08:14.026]  But the thing I'm trying to make clear here is we've got to explain who's behind the terror.
[00:08:14.566 --> 00:08:15.586]  Who has the motive?
[00:08:15.846 --> 00:08:17.387]  Who's been caught doing it before?
[00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.094]  I mean, folks, I understand them so well, but it's really not even hard to do.
[00:08:23.155 --> 00:08:24.276]  It's not like it's some feat.
[00:08:25.637 --> 00:08:30.982]  It'd be like if I said to my wife, honey, it's going to get dark in about an hour, and it was 8 o'clock at night.
[00:08:31.182 --> 00:08:33.564]  Everybody knows it's about to get dark, and it got dark.
[00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:36.287]  She would say, oh my gosh, you're the greatest genius on earth.
[00:08:37.008 --> 00:08:37.908]  I know how they work.
[00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:39.750]  These guys bombed OKC.
[00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.734]  These guys carry out the terror attacks.
[00:08:43.234 --> 00:08:46.437]  Every time they politically are losing, they stage terror attacks.
[00:08:46.677 --> 00:08:48.518]  That's in Army Field Manuals.
[00:08:48.998 --> 00:08:52.420]  In fact, will you guys search engine Army Field Manual 2004?
[00:08:56.063 --> 00:08:56.763]  False flag.
[00:08:57.364 --> 00:08:57.864]  That'll get it.
[00:08:57.924 --> 00:09:00.205]  And I want to, because I forget the exact Field Manual number.
[00:09:00.386 --> 00:09:03.928]  This is officially a secret Army Field Manual.
[00:09:03.968 --> 00:09:06.750]  The news admitted a year ago when this came out it was real.
[00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.851]  The Army got mad and said that's classified.
[00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:10.092]  WikiLeaks put it out.
[00:09:11.004 --> 00:09:15.289]  Now we already know the army did the stay behind networks and the NATO option and Gladio.
[00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:22.217]  Every time people in Italy or Germany or another country were about to vote out the government they didn't like, the U.S.
[00:09:22.297 --> 00:09:28.023]  Army goes and stages terror attacks and then blames it on the enemies and the Italian police go and arrest them.
[00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:30.432]  I mean, this is standard procedure.
[00:09:31.312 --> 00:09:31.813]  It's standard.
[00:09:32.373 --> 00:09:38.537]  The American people are about to get their rights back, get us out of the UN, abolish the Federal Reserve in 1995.
[00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:41.319]  The feds blew up their own federal building.
[00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:44.340]  I mean, these people have got aces up their sleeves.
[00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:49.123]  You heard the caller earlier saying, hey, I talked to my sheriff, he knows what's going on, I'm really positive.
[00:09:49.523 --> 00:09:51.225]  Yes, positive things are happening.
[00:09:51.505 --> 00:09:56.628]  But then, we know the establishment is going to stage terror attacks and say, we did it.
[00:09:57.108 --> 00:10:01.451]  Just like the sun came up this morning, and just like the sun's going down tonight.
[00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:03.312]  I mean, it's guaranteed!
[00:10:05.874 --> 00:10:08.476]  Unless we expose their trick.
[00:10:08.656 --> 00:10:12.198]  I mean, if somebody can cheat at cards, as long as you don't know they're cheating.
[00:10:12.439 --> 00:10:21.805]  But the minute you know they're leaning back with their fingers and pulling aces out of their sleeve, the minute you know they're doing that trick in the sleeve, it's over!
[00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:23.026]  You're like, hey, you're cheating!
[00:10:23.626 --> 00:10:24.447]  Give me my money back!
[00:10:24.947 --> 00:10:25.848]  You're cheating at poker!
[00:10:26.823 --> 00:10:27.784]  Thomas in Jersey.
[00:10:27.804 --> 00:10:28.765]  You're on the air, Thomas.
[00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:30.466]  Regards, Alex.
[00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:31.287]  Regards.
[00:10:31.307 --> 00:10:34.570]  I wanted to give you a heads up on one of the aces up their sleeves.
[00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:39.514]  I give you self-assembling block polymers.
[00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:42.256]  They're putting it in all vitamins, all supplements.
[00:10:42.557 --> 00:10:43.277]  It's in the water.
[00:10:43.838 --> 00:10:44.538]  It's in the food.
[00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:46.140]  It's in everything.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.060]  Alcohol, soda.
[00:10:48.041 --> 00:10:49.102]  It's a living plastic.
[00:10:49.162 --> 00:10:51.284]  It self-assembles in the body.
[00:10:51.424 --> 00:10:54.427]  It replicates and mutates and changes our DNA.
[00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:09.075]  Well, I happen to have German news and other mainstream news where they admit it's grown on dead fetal tissue, the Novartis vaccine, the big one the U.S.
[00:11:09.115 --> 00:11:15.698]  government bought, and that it has live cancer viruses in it.
[00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:25.824]  And that's out of... They're actually poly... They're grown in like a poly... What do you call it?
[00:11:25.864 --> 00:11:26.424]  Like a sediment.
[00:11:27.182 --> 00:11:27.962]  They grow it in a lab.
[00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:30.783]  It's made from just a polypill.
[00:11:31.923 --> 00:11:34.523]  Well, stay there, because you sound like you work in one of these labs.
[00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:37.344]  I just go off what the medical doctor is saying, what the news says.
[00:11:37.724 --> 00:11:49.386]  They grow the cancer viruses in caterpillar eggs, in dead baby retina tissue, for some reason, and in dead dog tissue and dead monkey tissue.
[00:11:49.806 --> 00:11:53.207]  So dogs, monkeys, dead babies, and caterpillar eggs.
[00:11:56.263 --> 00:11:58.845]  Maybe you can explain to me this other thing you're talking about.
[00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:01.286]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:12:01.466 --> 00:12:02.927]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:12:03.227 --> 00:12:05.449]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:12:05.889 --> 00:12:10.652]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:12:11.032 --> 00:12:13.894]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:17.736]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:30.115]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:12:30.655 --> 00:12:32.656]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:12:32.676 --> 00:12:33.976]  I use one every day.
[00:12:34.396 --> 00:12:36.857]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:37.838]  We're good to go.
[00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:02.567]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:13:02.848 --> 00:13:05.489]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:14.095]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:13:14.395 --> 00:13:17.217]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:21.280]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:24.182]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:13:24.582 --> 00:13:25.483]  Take action now!
[00:13:25.623 --> 00:13:29.286]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:34.209]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.652]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:44.197]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:13:44.477 --> 00:13:49.998]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:13:50.438 --> 00:13:52.539]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:13:52.779 --> 00:13:58.000]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.761]  It is a big idea.
[00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:03.881]  A new world order.
[00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:08.962]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:12.277]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:14.540]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:17.563]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:14:18.284 --> 00:14:25.613]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:14:28.632 --> 00:14:33.595]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:14:34.076 --> 00:14:37.538]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:40.420]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.661]  Most people have no idea.
[00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:42.441]  They're not after money.
[00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:43.542]  They have all the money they need.
[00:14:43.742 --> 00:14:44.463]  They're after power.
[00:14:44.723 --> 00:14:45.563]  That's what happens here.

[00:16:08.095 --> 00:16:17.723]  military counterinsurgency manual and the document site
[00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:30.433]  Scribd.com has it.
[00:16:30.773 --> 00:16:31.394]  Flashback!
[00:16:31.534 --> 00:16:31.834]  U.S.
[00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:33.516]  counterinsurgency manual leaked.
[00:16:33.896 --> 00:16:35.698]  Calls for false flag operations.
[00:16:36.138 --> 00:16:37.400]  Suspension of human rights.
[00:16:38.141 --> 00:16:39.602]  How to stage terror attacks.
[00:16:39.982 --> 00:16:41.084]  How to torture people.
[00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.526]  And the Army admits this is their document.
[00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.651]  So, just so you know.
[00:16:48.671 --> 00:16:50.473]  I mean, staging terror attacks is 101.
[00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:58.952]  So, the feds probably already have operations in motion, getting truck bomb ready, whatever.
[00:16:59.633 --> 00:17:03.995]  And just look, feds, when they kill a bunch of you and blow your daycares up, don't get mad at me, okay?
[00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.976]  I'm not the one blowing your daycares up.
[00:17:06.516 --> 00:17:10.318]  I guarantee you the media is going to have my face up there when your bosses kill you.
[00:17:12.233 --> 00:17:17.474]  And if I was the Feds, there's no way I'd work in a federal building with the history of your bosses targeting your kids.
[00:17:17.855 --> 00:17:22.356]  And of course, this bomb, because they know people hate Feds, will be put right by daycare.
[00:17:23.016 --> 00:17:24.636]  They're going to pick a place with a daycare.
[00:17:24.696 --> 00:17:25.076]  You watch.
[00:17:25.417 --> 00:17:27.597]  When they blow up your federal building, they're going to pick a daycare.
[00:17:27.617 --> 00:17:29.858]  Because they love to show dead kids.
[00:17:30.218 --> 00:17:36.320]  And they'll have people come out with the dead kid bloody on TV and say, the Bill of Rights did this, the gun owners did this.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.420]  And then all these idiots will say, oh, the Bill of Rights is bad.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.441]  See, that's how these people operate.
[00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.291]  Let's go back to your phone calls here.
[00:17:44.311 --> 00:17:48.093]  Let's talk to Rich in New York.
[00:17:48.213 --> 00:17:49.034]  Rich, you're on the air.
[00:17:49.074 --> 00:17:49.494]  Go ahead.
[00:17:50.654 --> 00:17:51.735]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[00:17:52.556 --> 00:17:52.896]  Welcome.
[00:17:53.736 --> 00:17:54.136]  Welcome.
[00:17:54.377 --> 00:17:55.437]  I love your show, man.
[00:17:55.457 --> 00:17:57.919]  I gotta say, I also dig your bump music.
[00:17:57.959 --> 00:18:01.801]  Wish you would play a little more Frank Zappa, because he knew it was going on for decades.
[00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:08.805]  Anyway, I'm a healthcare worker in New York City, and I had an idea about how to avoid the flu shot.
[00:18:09.727 --> 00:18:10.127]  I don't know.
[00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:28.091]  But look, I mean, it's more than just that.
[00:18:28.131 --> 00:18:39.502]  They're ordering the medical workers, I remember, I think it was you that called a few weeks ago and said, I just got the document, but since then it's been all over the news that they are forcing health care workers to take it, which is threatening them with their job.
[00:18:39.522 --> 00:18:40.303]  There's no law.
[00:18:40.984 --> 00:18:42.045]  You were that guy, right?
[00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:44.347]  Yes.
[00:18:44.467 --> 00:18:44.708]  Okay.
[00:18:44.968 --> 00:18:50.133]  I called Jason, I called Burmess up and spoke to him about the black ops helicopters a while back.
[00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:55.854]  So it was another guy from New York who was told they had to take the flu shot?
[00:18:55.874 --> 00:18:56.614]  That's all the news.
[00:18:56.674 --> 00:18:58.035]  The unions are fighting right now.
[00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:01.577]  I just want to get this straight because this is really getting wild here.
[00:19:02.317 --> 00:19:10.602]  Are you the caller, I'm just seeing if my memory is right, are you the caller that called a few weeks ago and said you guys have been told you had to take the flu shot?
[00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:13.980]  I had called several times.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.041]  I might have got in on there.
[00:19:15.081 --> 00:19:16.642]  It was an agenda that I had.
[00:19:16.682 --> 00:19:18.143]  They asked me what I wanted to talk about.
[00:19:18.183 --> 00:19:21.205]  I don't think I got through, but yeah, it's definitely going on.
[00:19:21.365 --> 00:19:22.846]  So it was another medical worker.
[00:19:22.906 --> 00:19:30.331]  I was just saying, the issue is, is this is really going on, that they're ordering people, through color of law, that they've got to take these shots.
[00:19:30.985 --> 00:19:48.497]  And I think now they've actually got that to the point where they have, well, 1199 has always been a little political as far as siding with the wrong people, but it seems like they're trying to move towards getting their health care workers to do this and they won't protect them.
[00:19:48.957 --> 00:19:58.384]  So my thing, my question to you, sir, is, is there a way, maybe through relinquishing your power of attorney, I've seen that.
[00:19:59.065 --> 00:20:00.546]  Government power of attorney over you.
[00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:04.390]  And just relinquish it and say, no, you don't have power of attorney over me.
[00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:11.136]  Well, I mean, they've got a... I guess with our license and our social and all that, signing off on that, but... Sure, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:20:13.298 --> 00:20:20.124]  There's an executive order and a UN treaty saying they can forcibly inject you, lock you down, shoot you if they need to.
[00:20:20.584 --> 00:20:21.505]  That's all on record.
[00:20:22.046 --> 00:20:23.247]  We've covered it here at Nauseam.
[00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:29.556]  You want to find it, just search engine, uh, Executive Order Quarantine.
[00:20:29.576 --> 00:20:34.361]  And that brings up CBS News first, and then it's got the Executive Order there for you.
[00:20:34.742 --> 00:20:37.425]  And it says it all there in one article, that's why I mentioned that one.
[00:20:37.785 --> 00:20:41.649]  Because there's still denial this is going on in big quarters out there.
[00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.213]  The COINTELPRO says that I'm the one making this up and that this isn't the news.
[00:20:46.734 --> 00:20:49.737]  Or that I'm making up there's a plan to poison our water.
[00:20:49.837 --> 00:21:01.607]  Or I'm making up that they want to euthanize us when it's all in their own documents and their own statements and their Biological Diversity Treaty 1996 and their Club of Rome documents and all of it.
[00:21:02.648 --> 00:21:04.890]  But in books like Ecoscience,
[00:21:06.425 --> 00:21:07.971]  No, this is really going on.
[00:21:08.011 --> 00:21:12.425]  They're really telling healthcare workers, police, military, you've got to take this shot.
[00:21:13.562 --> 00:21:14.923]  And most of them are saying no.
[00:21:15.484 --> 00:21:17.325]  So it looks like the program is going to stall.
[00:21:17.826 --> 00:21:26.653]  But, they're going to go ahead and create fear and hype over a few thousand people dying normally of flu in this season, as they always do.
[00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:29.195]  And then you're going to have huge hordes of people.
[00:21:29.255 --> 00:21:35.180]  I mean, over a couple deaths, they had people lined up in Austin hospitals and every other hospital in the country.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.321]  I saw the same reports all over the nation.
[00:21:37.762 --> 00:21:43.006]  Freaking out, panicking, wanting last year's shot, even though they admitted it wouldn't protect them and help them.
[00:21:44.577 --> 00:21:44.938]  Okay?
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.021]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[00:21:48.061 --> 00:21:49.083]  I'm gonna get into all this news.
[00:21:49.103 --> 00:21:49.523]  Stay with us.
[00:21:50.264 --> 00:21:51.165]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:53.268]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.893]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.912 --> 00:22:02.494]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:02.914 --> 00:22:07.878]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:10.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.104]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:15.284 --> 00:22:16.205]  How much do you want?
[00:22:16.465 --> 00:22:17.206]  When do you want it?
[00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:19.187]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:22:19.467 --> 00:22:20.308]  When will you need it?
[00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:22.609]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:22.749 --> 00:22:23.850]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.431]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:25.611 --> 00:22:30.695]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:22:30.895 --> 00:22:34.077]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:22:34.477 --> 00:22:37.940]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.261]  How much will you need?
[00:22:39.502 --> 00:22:40.122]  We don't know.
[00:22:40.403 --> 00:22:41.324]  How much do you want?
[00:22:41.524 --> 00:22:42.265]  All you can get.
[00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:43.286]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:46.310]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.352]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:22:48.372 --> 00:22:49.293]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:22:58.908 --> 00:23:04.095]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:04.215 --> 00:23:08.581]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:08.741 --> 00:23:10.604]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:11.024 --> 00:23:12.386]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:12.646 --> 00:23:13.688]  There is a solution.
[00:23:13.908 --> 00:23:21.934]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:29.419]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:23:35.823 --> 00:23:41.427]  I love their Nutri-Café, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:23:41.847 --> 00:23:45.649]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:23:58.882 --> 00:24:02.843]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:24:03.123 --> 00:24:04.883]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:24:05.123 --> 00:24:13.385]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:24:13.645 --> 00:24:18.867]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:24:19.187 --> 00:24:20.807]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:24:21.047 --> 00:24:27.369]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:24:27.569 --> 00:24:38.331]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:24:38.611 --> 00:24:39.111]  That's right.
[00:24:39.372 --> 00:24:41.672]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:24:41.952 --> 00:24:43.513]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[00:24:45.473 --> 00:24:50.255]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:50.275 --> 00:24:53.236]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:20.703]  Okay ladies and gentlemen, we've just gotten new reports in that are off the chart.
[00:25:20.763 --> 00:25:25.585]  National Guard drill at high school to prepare for possible H1N1 riot.
[00:25:26.366 --> 00:25:29.887]  National Guard takes over school in swine flu vaccine riot drill.
[00:25:31.448 --> 00:25:34.809]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[00:25:34.889 --> 00:25:36.690]  This is really happening.
[00:25:37.577 --> 00:25:40.922]  Now I'm going to go over all this in about 10 minutes.
[00:25:41.643 --> 00:25:46.409]  Call everyone you know, everybody that's asking what's going on with the flu.
[00:25:46.569 --> 00:25:47.270]  Is it deadly?
[00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.292]  Is it not deadly?
[00:25:48.692 --> 00:25:49.533]  What's the plan?
[00:25:49.613 --> 00:25:50.875]  What's happening in America?
[00:25:51.854 --> 00:25:52.695]  We're going to break it down.
[00:25:52.715 --> 00:26:06.425]  I'm going to continue taking calls and in about 10 minutes I'm going to get into this because it's just really hitting me that I have become so conditioned to the fact that these people are doing this that I'm not responding to this as seriously as I should.
[00:26:06.445 --> 00:26:12.029]  They are clearly going to make their move unless we get the word out and scream bloody murder.
[00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.150]  This is not a drill.
[00:26:13.511 --> 00:26:14.571]  This is not a game.
[00:26:14.992 --> 00:26:16.393]  This is happening!
[00:26:20.435 --> 00:26:21.736]  Now I'm going to give each caller one minute.
[00:26:21.996 --> 00:26:22.476]  I have to.
[00:26:23.256 --> 00:26:25.917]  George in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:26:26.457 --> 00:26:27.538]  I'll be on less than a minute.
[00:26:27.578 --> 00:26:29.459]  Thank you for being the Paul Revere of our time.
[00:26:31.159 --> 00:26:38.302]  As far as I'm cutting the internet off, my internet technician son said if you could set up a virtual private network
[00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:51.421]  Uh, to allow us to get into your site, uh, maybe through, uh, your TV network as, uh, part of a paid bonus or through, uh, paid GCN that, that, that would be... Yes, the problem is, is that there are hubs.
[00:26:52.355 --> 00:26:56.118]  There are major backbone systems that they're going to shut down.
[00:26:56.158 --> 00:26:57.138]  That's not our opinion.
[00:26:57.439 --> 00:26:59.400]  In fact, search engine this headline for folks.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.942]  Should Obama be able to shut off the web?
[00:27:02.482 --> 00:27:12.830]  And then you'll see Mother Jones, The Nation, New York Times saying to save the web, they have to kill the web and go to a thing where you only have a few thousand choices.
[00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.472]  So it's turning it into glorified cable.
[00:27:15.952 --> 00:27:17.833]  They are really doing that.
[00:27:17.873 --> 00:27:18.454]  Here's a good one.
[00:27:18.974 --> 00:27:24.158]  But the point is, should President Obama have the power to shut down domestic internet traffic?
[00:27:24.859 --> 00:27:29.903]  This is what cyber security and the Air Force and Pentagon setting up these hubs is doing.
[00:27:30.703 --> 00:27:33.565]  Of course, we can set up private networks over phone lines and stuff.
[00:27:33.605 --> 00:27:35.166]  It's kind of like the old BBS system.
[00:27:35.546 --> 00:27:45.073]  But for the big, massive pull we have, reaching tens of millions a week now, and yes, that's what we're reaching, it's a scary responsibility, we will not have that anymore.
[00:27:45.113 --> 00:27:57.981]  So people better save this information, save these videos, get them on their computers, off the web, and have libraries so that you'll have the material to give people if things continue to implode and collapse.
[00:27:58.001 --> 00:27:58.582]  But go ahead, sir.
[00:27:59.278 --> 00:27:59.918]  Question.
[00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:02.960]  I'm taking two more info warriors that you're suggesting.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.922]  You thought the people with the money were headed for the Cook Islands.
[00:28:05.942 --> 00:28:07.423]  We're going to go see if we can find them.
[00:28:07.463 --> 00:28:10.025]  Do you have any idea where they might be there?
[00:28:10.905 --> 00:28:11.485]  Say that again?
[00:28:12.126 --> 00:28:15.888]  You suggested that the people with the big money might be hiding out in the Cook Islands.
[00:28:16.408 --> 00:28:17.469]  Well, there's no maybe.
[00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:22.472]  I was saying that Austin is the richest town in the country per capita.
[00:28:23.433 --> 00:28:26.535]  It's like the vacation spot, the home away from home,
[00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:30.751]  of the money from florida new york uh...
[00:28:31.618 --> 00:28:35.279]  This is where people in New England come during the winter.
[00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:38.799]  Austin is now the wealthiest city in the country per capita.
[00:28:39.439 --> 00:28:45.741]  There's other areas like San Francisco or Manhattan or places where there's more money, but per capita, a lot of money lives here.
[00:28:46.101 --> 00:28:51.762]  And I've got lawyers and friends and people that serve the elite as their lawyers.
[00:28:52.002 --> 00:28:53.702]  I know people that are billionaires.
[00:28:54.322 --> 00:28:56.663]  They've all left the country in the last three years.
[00:28:57.103 --> 00:28:58.183]  They've gone to Switzerland.
[00:28:58.823 --> 00:29:08.167]  They've gone to Cook Islands, they've gone to New Zealand, they're not even really going to Costa Rica, that's kind of the poor guy place to go, like for old spooks and people, old CIA folks.
[00:29:09.408 --> 00:29:19.893]  So, yeah, you go to the Cook Islands and places, I mean, the Cook Islands are big, they have big towns and cities, and you go to the rich neighborhoods with armored fences and security guards, that's where they are.
[00:29:19.913 --> 00:29:22.694]  I wanted to look for them and bring the information back.
[00:29:22.834 --> 00:29:23.675]  Thank you for your service.
[00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:25.276]  Alright, God bless you, I appreciate it.
[00:29:26.336 --> 00:29:27.637]  No, I mean, there's no secret.
[00:29:28.499 --> 00:29:32.500]  I mean, Google rich-fleeing United States, rich-fleeing Israel.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.481]  Israel is probably going to get nuked or something.
[00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:37.662]  Maybe even by Israel.
[00:29:38.422 --> 00:29:44.604]  Of the top ten richest people, that was a Jerusalem Post article or was it Haaretz?
[00:29:45.504 --> 00:29:49.505]  Of the top ten, if memory serves, seven of them have left.
[00:29:51.386 --> 00:29:51.666]  Okay?
[00:29:51.846 --> 00:29:52.526]  They're leaving.
[00:29:52.626 --> 00:29:54.447]  They're leaving the U.S., they're leaving Israel.
[00:30:01.618 --> 00:30:02.419]  Who's up next, John?
[00:30:02.439 --> 00:30:03.280]  My list just changed.
[00:30:07.224 --> 00:30:08.605]  Matt and Pia, you're on the air.
[00:30:11.128 --> 00:30:11.428]  Hello.
[00:30:11.989 --> 00:30:12.249]  Hi.
[00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:20.878]  Why does anybody who would administer a shot, the H1N1 vaccine, need to be deputized?
[00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:25.002]  Because they, admittedly, are going to be forcing you to take it.
[00:30:25.865 --> 00:30:30.569]  Well, that's right on, uh, I got a link right off of Drudge, uh, linking to Boston.com.
[00:30:30.869 --> 00:30:32.910]  No, I, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:33.111 --> 00:30:39.856]  That Massachusetts is deputizing, uh, dentists and pharmaceutics, uh, pharmacists and healthcare workers.
[00:30:42.262 --> 00:30:42.903]  Absolutely.
[00:30:43.163 --> 00:30:43.543]  Here it is.
[00:30:43.583 --> 00:30:44.504]  Here's the article right here.
[00:30:44.984 --> 00:30:46.185]  We'll zoom in on it for everybody.
[00:30:46.705 --> 00:30:49.207]  State takes extra steps to battle flu in fall.
[00:30:49.647 --> 00:30:56.471]  Massachusetts health authorities took the unprecedented step yesterday of deputizing dentists, paramedics, and pharmacists to help administer vaccines.
[00:30:57.492 --> 00:31:01.595]  Against both the seasonal flu and novel swine, expected to make a return visit.
[00:31:01.915 --> 00:31:03.617]  Why couldn't healthcare workers give the shots?
[00:31:03.637 --> 00:31:04.778]  They're going to be forcing them.
[00:31:05.158 --> 00:31:08.360]  This is the model state's Health Emergency Powers Act.
[00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:10.642]  This is not our opinion.
[00:31:11.162 --> 00:31:22.091]  Now again, they may set all this up, create fear, have people panic and beg for the shots, just to create the image of people begging for it, and then the real attack comes two, three years down the road.
[00:31:23.143 --> 00:31:24.323]  That could be what's happening.
[00:31:24.703 --> 00:31:30.745]  But there's no doubt at stage, there's no doubt they're hyping it, there's no doubt they're bringing in the martial law.
[00:31:31.025 --> 00:31:33.905]  Now, are they going to fully, fully implement it?
[00:31:34.385 --> 00:31:34.885]  I don't know.
[00:31:35.386 --> 00:31:44.427]  But, all this COINTELPRO, the last six months, all over talk radio, in the last eight months, since January, I've been saying, I believe they're going to play the flu card.
[00:31:44.868 --> 00:31:46.148]  I believe they're going to play the flu card.
[00:31:47.068 --> 00:31:47.988]  Knowing the enemy.
[00:31:49.028 --> 00:31:51.369]  Seeing their preparations, their conditioning.
[00:31:52.182 --> 00:31:58.707]  And then in April I said, I don't know if this is real, but they're certainly setting it up like it is.
[00:31:59.567 --> 00:32:00.348]  This could be it.
[00:32:00.888 --> 00:32:02.089]  I've got internal documents.
[00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:03.350]  We're really at level six.
[00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.451]  Months later it came out I was accurate.
[00:32:06.392 --> 00:32:08.093]  I posted the secret document.
[00:32:08.514 --> 00:32:10.875]  And COINTELPRO attacks and says we're making it up.
[00:32:11.356 --> 00:32:12.817]  I'm getting death threats, everything else.
[00:32:12.877 --> 00:32:15.178]  This is really happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:16.499 --> 00:32:17.180]  Anything else, sir?
[00:32:18.301 --> 00:32:19.702]  No, just keep up the good fight, man.
[00:32:21.949 --> 00:32:23.190]  Oh, I just wish it wasn't real.
[00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.372]  Believe me, I wish I wasn't telling the truth.
[00:32:28.493 --> 00:32:37.438]  I told people back in October they threatened Congress with martial law because we had sources, and then a few days later it came out on C-SPAN and people still say I'm a liar.
[00:32:38.278 --> 00:32:44.622]  I can have Senator Inhofe, Congressman, who's the one from California we always have on, Sherman.
[00:32:45.402 --> 00:32:48.605]  Ron Paul has told you and now it's been in the mainstream news.
[00:32:48.665 --> 00:32:50.906]  I mean, it's really happening.
[00:32:50.966 --> 00:32:56.090]  I mean, they really say they're poisoning our water and want to sterilize us and take all the children at birth.
[00:32:56.351 --> 00:33:02.856]  They really say they're taking the kids in England now, starting with 22,000 families, and making them guilty first.
[00:33:03.576 --> 00:33:07.919]  Just taking the kids and raising them in government facilities and cameras in the people's homes.
[00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:09.620]  I mean, people don't believe that.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.602]  Just Google 22,000 cameras to watch 20 people in British homes.
[00:33:13.642 --> 00:33:16.203]  I mean, you can't make it up!
[00:33:22.487 --> 00:33:25.709]  It could all end if we just stand up and realize these are criminals running things.
[00:33:26.009 --> 00:33:26.829]  It would all end.
[00:33:26.869 --> 00:33:27.750]  It would all end.
[00:33:30.848 --> 00:33:36.531]  You know, I use Hollywood movies as parallels or analogies because the public may not know history, but they know Hollywood movies.
[00:33:37.171 --> 00:33:39.392]  And I was jogging for an hour this morning.
[00:33:40.012 --> 00:33:43.714]  Even though the world's going to hell in a handbasket, I've made the commitment to take that time out every day.
[00:33:45.635 --> 00:33:49.437]  And it's a parable of how slow and easy wins the race.
[00:33:49.477 --> 00:33:52.098]  Taking action actually pays off.
[00:33:52.158 --> 00:33:52.858]  I've lost 36, 37 pounds now.
[00:33:53.278 --> 00:33:57.220]  I'm going to lose another 30 plus.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:58.241]  I'm going to go down to 180.
[00:34:02.534 --> 00:34:03.534]  But that's a side issue.
[00:34:03.554 --> 00:34:13.238]  I watched the last hour of 10,000 B.C., which is a hypothetical.
[00:34:13.258 --> 00:34:14.399]  It's not really real.
[00:34:14.459 --> 00:34:17.060]  It's kind of legend, like some guys from Atlantis
[00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:37.200]  You know, their civilization just destroyed in an earthquake, so they, you know, three white dudes is basically what they are, go into Egypt and the Mediterranean, out the Mediterranean, they park their ship, they con the locals that they're gods, wearing headdresses, fooling them, and then they set up a slave system.
[00:34:37.921 --> 00:34:44.323]  Well, that's actually what the priests in Egypt actually did, and that's the secrets the masons have.
[00:34:44.343 --> 00:34:45.943]  That's the guild secret.
[00:34:46.164 --> 00:34:49.064]  It's actually how to manipulate populations, how to compartmentalize.
[00:34:49.465 --> 00:34:55.226]  So I saw this movie, people have been telling me about it, and most of it's fiction, but it's got some real history set in it.
[00:34:56.687 --> 00:34:59.047]  And it's all how they sit there and con the people.
[00:34:59.448 --> 00:35:00.488]  They're not really gods.
[00:35:02.028 --> 00:35:07.330]  But it's just, a few of them are able, there's only one living by the end of the movie, and finally the guy throws the spear and kills him.
[00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:11.331]  I'm giving the movie away, but you should see it, because adults will see this and won't even get it.
[00:35:17.033 --> 00:35:31.158]  And so you've got this priest classed, only a few hundred priests, and this one con artist, manipulating tens of thousands of slaves, and bowing down, because he knew how to take some minerals and throw it into fire, and it goes BOOM!
[00:35:32.833 --> 00:35:37.635]  That's what the New World Order is, is a little con artist throwing something in a fire that goes boom.
[00:35:38.195 --> 00:35:38.955]  That's the New World Order.
[00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:46.857]  It's made up, it's magician, it's flim flam, it's theater, it's crud, it's crap, it's lies.
[00:35:48.738 --> 00:35:50.319]  And that's how these globalists operate.
[00:35:50.339 --> 00:35:51.779]  It's why their symbol is the pyramid.
[00:35:52.499 --> 00:35:57.921]  Is that they sit at the top of the knowledge of how humans work, of psychology.
[00:35:59.081 --> 00:36:01.122]  And they use it against us.
[00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:06.357]  I mean, there had been all sorts of expeditions to the North American continent.
[00:36:06.698 --> 00:36:08.020]  Leif Erikson had been here.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.522]  Eric the Red had been here.
[00:36:11.025 --> 00:36:12.127]  There were all the maps.
[00:36:12.687 --> 00:36:15.131]  These are in the Royal Archives in England and France.
[00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.511]  And Christopher Columbus was a mason, and they said, here's the map.
[00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:24.672]  We've decided to go ahead and fund, you know, moving into this area and letting people know the world's around.
[00:36:25.112 --> 00:36:25.992]  He said, thank you!
[00:36:26.572 --> 00:36:27.512]  I'll now go do that.
[00:36:27.532 --> 00:36:30.453]  But that's what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:30.653 --> 00:36:32.173]  This is mainline history.
[00:36:32.433 --> 00:36:33.993]  They just don't teach you that in school.
[00:36:34.193 --> 00:36:38.254]  They tell you, oh, in 1498 or whatever, you know, he found America.
[00:36:38.314 --> 00:36:39.574]  Yeah, right, he did, sure.
[00:36:40.795 --> 00:36:42.135]  And I'm a Chinese jet pilot.
[00:36:44.127 --> 00:36:46.028]  And Barack Obama sincere, you know.
[00:36:46.209 --> 00:36:47.650]  And George Bush loves the children.
[00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.871]  And Saddam Hussein had WMDs.
[00:36:50.552 --> 00:36:52.533]  This is the reality.
[00:36:55.135 --> 00:36:56.336]  That you're being conned.
[00:36:56.936 --> 00:36:57.977]  You're being manipulated.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.962]  Nicolette, or Nikita, excuse me, in Illinois.
[00:37:05.002 --> 00:37:05.883]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:37:06.704 --> 00:37:10.727]  Here's something I want to tell you about the swine flu.
[00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:11.987]  I think that
[00:37:13.786 --> 00:37:22.473]  They made the swine flu just to make people get the vaccine and steal all their money.
[00:37:22.493 --> 00:37:22.934]  How old are you?
[00:37:22.954 --> 00:37:23.694]  I'm just curious.
[00:37:23.714 --> 00:37:27.237]  How old are you? 13.
[00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:44.850]  Yeah, well it's good to have you calling.
[00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.111]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[00:37:46.912 --> 00:37:49.734]  I've been listening to the show... two days ago.
[00:37:50.598 --> 00:37:51.678]  Right, good to have you on board.
[00:37:52.258 --> 00:37:54.179]  Listen, it's not just that.
[00:37:54.379 --> 00:37:57.160]  We know the vaccine has cancer viruses, chop full.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:11.084]  We know it has these chemicals that accelerate the autoimmune response that normally cause the brain expansion, that cause the autoimmune response and the brain damaging, that it fries your pancreas.
[00:38:11.744 --> 00:38:13.424]  Also, in fact, print this for me.
[00:38:13.444 --> 00:38:14.605]  I had it in the stack last week.
[00:38:14.885 --> 00:38:18.406]  There's a whole bunch of university studies proving that these
[00:38:20.222 --> 00:38:35.396]  These chemicals they add to elicit the autoimmune response in all lab animals causes juvenile, or their older whatever age they are, massive onset of degenerative and extremely
[00:38:36.969 --> 00:38:38.390]  Debilitative arthritis.
[00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.392]  So see, everybody's wondering why I'm 19 and got arthritis.
[00:38:42.412 --> 00:38:44.874]  Well, you took the shots from eugenicists.
[00:38:44.894 --> 00:38:47.215]  You've been hit hard with a bio-attack.
[00:38:47.255 --> 00:38:49.037]  I mean, you know, they're hitting you hard.
[00:38:49.597 --> 00:38:55.941]  They don't write giant government policy books because they want to, you know, write them to just put them on the bookshelf.
[00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:57.442]  These people mean business.
[00:38:57.742 --> 00:38:58.743]  These are men of action.
[00:38:59.003 --> 00:38:59.903]  The world's theirs.
[00:39:00.224 --> 00:39:02.305]  And you ain't in the future, they've got set up.
[00:39:03.894 --> 00:39:06.875]  So yes, you want arthritis when you're 13.
[00:39:07.736 --> 00:39:09.317]  You want to be retarded when you're 20.
[00:39:09.697 --> 00:39:10.737]  You want cancer when you're 40.
[00:39:11.338 --> 00:39:11.938]  Take the shot.
[00:39:13.378 --> 00:39:14.899]  But, you're absolutely right.
[00:39:15.379 --> 00:39:16.860]  Because they're about making money.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:23.143]  When Bayer knowingly shipped out a million plus shots, knowing everybody that took it was going to get HIV and hepatitis, they made money.
[00:39:23.163 --> 00:39:26.445]  They said, not only am I going to kill you, you're going to pay for me to murder you.
[00:39:26.625 --> 00:39:27.665]  And they said, absolutely.
[00:39:27.685 --> 00:39:28.586]  Let me give you that money.
[00:39:29.486 --> 00:39:29.906]  Here you go.
[00:39:30.106 --> 00:39:30.807]  You know what?
[00:39:31.667 --> 00:39:32.227]  How much you want?
[00:39:32.267 --> 00:39:33.988]  You want $5 to kill me?
[00:39:34.548 --> 00:39:35.068]  You want another $5?
[00:39:36.029 --> 00:39:37.629]  How about $300 to kill me?
[00:39:37.669 --> 00:39:38.029]  Here you go.
[00:39:38.049 --> 00:39:39.570]  That's about what it costs for that factory.
[00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.450]  Kill me!
[00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:42.551]  Here, please kill me.
[00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:43.391]  Please kill me.
[00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:44.131]  You bet.
[00:39:44.151 --> 00:39:45.152]  We'll kill you real good.
[00:39:47.639 --> 00:39:51.561]  You try to go protest out front, Bayer, they'll have the cops come over with tasers and taser you!
[00:39:51.781 --> 00:39:53.362]  And those cops will go shoot the kids up!
[00:39:53.782 --> 00:39:55.863]  Oh, here you go, I like my kid being brain damaged!
[00:39:55.983 --> 00:39:56.684]  I'm a cop!
[00:39:57.224 --> 00:39:58.104]  I like having power!
[00:39:58.144 --> 00:40:00.526]  I love being scammed by the priest class!
[00:40:00.826 --> 00:40:02.967]  Up there on the hill, running their fraud on me all day!
[00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:03.847]  It's fun!
[00:40:04.628 --> 00:40:08.590]  I'm sorry, uh... Nikita, go ahead and finish your point.
[00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:16.734]  Yeah, yeah, uh, about that, um... I've heard of the vaccine, cause my mom listens to this Russian radio show,
[00:40:17.649 --> 00:40:20.031]  And it's only been like tested.
[00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:28.156]  It's not, it hasn't been tested on humans, but I think they deliberately killed it, made it.
[00:40:29.196 --> 00:40:30.157]  So, yeah.
[00:40:30.557 --> 00:40:34.280]  I've seen your End Game video and the Obama Deception.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:45.647]  Uh, right now what they're doing in my school, they're having like, they're making us, uh, the food that we're gonna eat this year is gonna be from
[00:40:46.963 --> 00:40:49.324]  It's going to be from the government.
[00:40:49.564 --> 00:40:51.005]  It's going to be government controlled.
[00:40:51.425 --> 00:40:54.046]  It's from the USDA, so... Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:54.066 --> 00:40:55.767]  You're not allowed to bring your own food.
[00:40:57.207 --> 00:40:57.908]  Well, you're allowed.
[00:40:57.928 --> 00:40:58.908]  You're allowed, still.
[00:40:59.228 --> 00:41:00.649]  Some schools are phasing out.
[00:41:00.709 --> 00:41:02.690]  No, you've got to eat the special food they've got.
[00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.690]  Well, that's what they're phasing in.
[00:41:04.991 --> 00:41:06.111]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:41:06.151 --> 00:41:06.811]  Good to hear from you.
[00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:11.593]  We're going to come back, and in the next segment, the segment after that, I'm going to break down the big news.
[00:41:12.354 --> 00:41:14.054]  The whole grid coming into view.
[00:41:14.174 --> 00:41:15.095]  No more denying.
[00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:17.542]  No more time to live in denial.
[00:41:18.902 --> 00:41:19.682]  No more time.
[00:41:21.203 --> 00:41:23.284]  The vaccines do come from fetal tissue.
[00:41:24.644 --> 00:41:28.626]  In fact, there was a caller earlier I meant to go back to, who was saying it was grown in some sediment.
[00:41:29.466 --> 00:41:31.427]  I mean, just search engine in front of everybody.
[00:41:33.228 --> 00:41:35.229]  He may be talking about some other kind of vaccine.
[00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:40.131]  These stem cell, stem line, cloned vaccines.
[00:41:40.171 --> 00:41:41.271]  It's a cloning process.
[00:41:42.011 --> 00:41:42.912]  Well, just search
[00:41:44.881 --> 00:41:51.163]  Vaccines grown in caterpillar eggs, or vaccines grown in fetal tissue.
[00:41:52.184 --> 00:41:53.144]  I mean, it's a fact.
[00:41:53.164 --> 00:41:55.045]  So I don't know what that fella's talking about.
[00:41:56.925 --> 00:42:06.629]  But, I know vaccines being grown in eggs, but the eggs, the virus seed though, was originally grown in the fetal tissue.
[00:42:07.552 --> 00:42:09.835]  Or it was, see, see, the virus lines.
[00:42:10.535 --> 00:42:14.800]  And hey, if you think injecting dead babies is in you is good, go ahead.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.322]  You know, I'm the extremist.
[00:42:16.482 --> 00:42:22.529]  I'm the bad man who will sit here and pull up articles where they do these tests and it kills 25% of people that take them.
[00:42:22.909 --> 00:42:25.011]  You know, with the bird flu vaccine trial last year.
[00:42:25.452 --> 00:42:26.152]  London Telegraph.
[00:42:27.079 --> 00:42:33.184]  You know, I'm the guy that will sit here and tell you that they're going to use it for martial law, and now it's months later all over the news.
[00:42:33.644 --> 00:42:35.605]  Because we understand the enemy operation.
[00:42:35.906 --> 00:42:38.748]  And again, I keep saying, I've laid out the facts.
[00:42:38.808 --> 00:42:39.448]  We've been right.
[00:42:39.728 --> 00:42:41.109]  We know what we're talking about here.
[00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.791]  People better listen!
[00:42:44.002 --> 00:42:45.624]  There's not time to play games.
[00:42:46.005 --> 00:42:47.968]  I'm not risking my life up here for nothing.
[00:42:48.008 --> 00:42:48.709]  This is real.
[00:42:49.089 --> 00:42:50.712]  I don't just believe I'm telling the truth.
[00:42:51.072 --> 00:42:51.593]  I know.
[00:42:51.613 --> 00:42:53.195]  I know I'm right.
[00:42:53.896 --> 00:42:55.418]  All I do is think about this.
[00:42:55.919 --> 00:42:57.041]  All I do is study this.
[00:43:02.851 --> 00:43:08.312]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:08.872]  and the world.
[00:43:09.132 --> 00:43:12.593]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:43:12.993 --> 00:43:19.254]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:43:19.494 --> 00:43:21.294]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.

[00:44:02.612 --> 00:44:07.936]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:08.656 --> 00:44:13.980]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:44:14.521 --> 00:44:20.685]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:20.945 --> 00:44:22.846]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:22.966 --> 00:44:25.366]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:25.446 --> 00:44:36.389]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:38.629 --> 00:44:39.910]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:41.690]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:48.412]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.081]  The people strike back!
[00:45:01.846 --> 00:45:04.867]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?

[00:46:21.597 --> 00:46:25.380]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.743]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[00:46:30.817 --> 00:46:33.879]  It's not a drill, it's not a game, it is the real world.
[00:46:34.099 --> 00:46:35.700]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.341]  Wayne Madison coming up in about 10 minutes.
[00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:38.902]  And more of your phone calls.
[00:46:38.922 --> 00:46:41.183]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:46:42.104 --> 00:46:43.325]  When I got up here on air...
[00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:51.160]  In the last 13 years, and talked about how the military was preparing to take over America.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.121]  I didn't know when it was going to happen.
[00:46:53.641 --> 00:47:00.386]  I just went to urban warfare drills where the military admitted they were, and admitted they were practicing to break up our families and take our guns.
[00:47:00.887 --> 00:47:05.230]  Then I found out about Rex 84 and congressional hearings about FEMA camps.
[00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:11.975]  And I got the congressional video of it and made films and interviewed police chiefs they tried to buy off.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.469]  I found out that you have a drug dealing, child kidnap...
[00:47:18.442 --> 00:47:44.603]  ring-running private global corporate group of just totally ruthless people that launder money, create Ponzi schemes, get all their power through the regional private central banks that issue the currency and credit, that this sick crew of criminals who all one-up each other on the most evil stuff they can do, are also eugenicists and believe that we're scum and trash and deserve to die, as the White House science czar writes and says, in Ecoscience.
[00:47:47.779 --> 00:47:53.264]  And it's been clear in the last seven, eight years, they were going to use vaccines as one way to do it.
[00:47:53.884 --> 00:48:01.290]  And through the shots give you a binary weapon, so they can later give you the other half and kill you, but then they won't be affected.
[00:48:01.851 --> 00:48:09.437]  And then it turns out we've got government documents about soft kill weapons, and in here they talk about vaccines that sterilize you, and the South Africans do it.
[00:48:09.457 --> 00:48:12.099]  These big CNN producers have now made a report about it.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.921]  I mean, this is really going on.
[00:48:14.926 --> 00:48:19.094]  And it's covered in the film, uh, Anthrax War that we carry at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:19.114 --> 00:48:19.775]  They're on the bookstore.
[00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:25.807]  So I told people back in January and March...
[00:48:26.812 --> 00:48:31.254]  In April, January, February, March, April, I said, I think they're going to play the flu card.
[00:48:31.555 --> 00:48:32.995]  March 5th, I did a whole show on it.
[00:48:33.476 --> 00:48:34.716]  And I said, they're getting the troops ready.
[00:48:34.736 --> 00:48:35.877]  They're getting the mass graves ready.
[00:48:35.897 --> 00:48:37.098]  They're getting the National Guard ready.
[00:48:37.338 --> 00:48:41.060]  They're getting the troops ready to lock down the cities under NORTHCOM, Brigade Homeland.
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.061]  It isn't just Bush, it's Obama.
[00:48:43.161 --> 00:48:44.522]  It's seamless integration.
[00:48:45.262 --> 00:48:46.242]  It's all staged.
[00:48:46.823 --> 00:48:51.445]  People would laugh at me, even when I held up government documents, and they would say it wasn't real.
[00:48:52.506 --> 00:48:54.507]  Now, you can just Google
[00:48:56.095 --> 00:49:08.398]  the term or search engine the term let's do that for folks right now search engine the term internment resettlement specialist building an army dot mil national guard dot mail
[00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:16.010]  Saying we're setting up camps in America, we need to be able to rehabilitate and re-educate the American people, we need you to run these camps.
[00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.571]  And they admit they're building them now and it's all over the news.
[00:49:18.611 --> 00:49:21.673]  See, they just need- the media knew they were there.
[00:49:21.993 --> 00:49:27.296]  They just had to stall long enough to get that it was for the flu in place.
[00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:29.197]  But they built this all years ago.
[00:49:30.748 --> 00:49:32.690]  Now it doesn't mean they're going to do it this fall.
[00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:38.875]  They already tried the model State's Health Emergency Powers Act forced inoculation 2002-2003.
[00:49:38.895 --> 00:49:44.419]  14 million of their own first responders said they wouldn't take the shots, the vast majority, so they suspended it.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.062]  They're going to try it again, but each time training us to accept it.
[00:49:48.102 --> 00:49:51.846]  But with the flu, people weren't scared of them saying you've got to take the shots for smallpox.
[00:49:52.785 --> 00:49:54.247]  It's a federalization drill.
[00:49:54.588 --> 00:49:56.130]  It's a UN control grill.
[00:49:57.071 --> 00:49:58.353]  It does all these different things.
[00:49:58.413 --> 00:49:59.855]  It trains us to go under their control.
[00:50:00.175 --> 00:50:03.460]  Trains us to accept in our body what they want to force in our body.
[00:50:05.483 --> 00:50:06.384]  Sets that precedent.
[00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:09.716]  Now, everybody's freaking out.
[00:50:10.036 --> 00:50:14.597]  Because CNN's reporting military planning possible H1N1 outbreak.
[00:50:14.957 --> 00:50:18.778]  Gates Memo announces final dissemination of National Guard into the reserves.
[00:50:19.138 --> 00:50:20.218]  Boston.com.
[00:50:20.598 --> 00:50:23.079]  State takes extra steps in flu battle.
[00:50:23.139 --> 00:50:25.519]  Deputizes dentists to others to help with vaccinations.
[00:50:25.819 --> 00:50:26.879]  Forced vaccinations.
[00:50:27.399 --> 00:50:30.520]  Virus, uh, vaccine contains cancer viruses.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.040]  Build.de.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.120]  Top German news.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.321]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:38.201]  Now it's all coming out!
[00:50:38.221 --> 00:50:39.082]  Stay with us.
[00:50:39.922 --> 00:50:44.923]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.

[00:50:48.824 --> 00:50:50.304]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:50:50.584 --> 00:50:52.385]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:50:52.585 --> 00:50:53.245]  Well, you should.

[00:51:08.878 --> 00:51:14.285]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol.
[00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:22.732]  In the caliber of your choice, I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:51:23.092 --> 00:51:28.317]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:51:28.637 --> 00:51:29.778]  This is real.

[00:52:16.139 --> 00:52:20.961]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:21.081 --> 00:52:29.025]  Wayne Madsen is one of the first international journalists reporting from Capitol Hill saying the top virologist he talked to said the H1N1 was manufactured.
[00:52:29.065 --> 00:52:30.946]  That then came out in BBC, The Spiegel.
[00:52:30.966 --> 00:52:34.448]  They looked at it, it is manufactured, they don't know by who.
[00:52:34.628 --> 00:52:41.651]  But the issue is, it's only killed 1,800 and something in the other hemisphere during the peak of the season.
[00:52:42.699 --> 00:52:43.139]  The U.S.
[00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:43.139]  37,000.
[00:52:43.179 --> 00:52:45.760]  36,800 and something, I round up.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:51.822]  Let's just say 36,000, 37,000 die a year from regular flu.
[00:52:52.562 --> 00:52:56.124]  What is going to happen when tens of thousands die from the flu?
[00:52:56.464 --> 00:52:57.804]  They can shut everything down.
[00:52:59.085 --> 00:53:00.605]  It's training for federal takeover.
[00:53:00.925 --> 00:53:01.906]  Training for U.N.
[00:53:01.946 --> 00:53:02.406]  under level 6.
[00:53:03.991 --> 00:53:07.592]  Takeover, which under level six were under who control?
[00:53:07.973 --> 00:53:08.933]  World Health Organization.
[00:53:09.333 --> 00:53:21.098]  Now, I kept telling you, because I'm only going off the model state's health emergency powers act, that's federal law, for them to lock down the cities, forcibly inject you, take you to sports stadiums.
[00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:33.263]  I mean, I've read hundreds of articles on air over the last eight years or so, seven years, that they've been hyping this, where they admit that they're going to lock down the cities and forcibly inject you.
[00:53:33.925 --> 00:53:35.885]  I mean, it's not like people are saying, how did you know this?
[00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:36.826]  It's all coming true.
[00:53:37.486 --> 00:53:38.786]  This is what they said they were going to do.
[00:53:38.806 --> 00:53:43.447]  So everybody's calling up, freaking out, emails, calls the office, everybody going nuts.
[00:53:45.128 --> 00:53:48.068]  You should be upset, but this is standard procedure.
[00:53:48.429 --> 00:53:50.669]  See, I mean, people keep thinking I'm making all this up.
[00:53:50.909 --> 00:53:52.730]  I'm going off their own admissions.
[00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:55.310]  I keep saying that, but it's incredible.
[00:53:55.330 --> 00:54:02.132]  I mean, I'll get calls from the national media going, you said they were doing gun confiscation drills in Iowa.
[00:54:03.846 --> 00:54:14.190]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center is attacking me all over national news saying I was reading out of the Iowa newspaper where the army officer was there saying it was a gun confiscation drill.
[00:54:18.371 --> 00:54:20.112]  I mean, it just makes my head spin.
[00:54:21.552 --> 00:54:33.116]  You know, it's like when I tell you there's an army field manual, and I read the army field manual number to you earlier, let's punch up the actual manual that tells them how to stage terror attacks against people to blame it on them.
[00:54:36.414 --> 00:54:59.747]  And I told you that the key to them implementing this flu, this dark winter, I told you the key to that would be if they simultaneously say gun owners are malicious, are white supremacist, so they demonize gun owners and malicious, and are planning to strike.
[00:54:59.807 --> 00:55:05.070]  And I said if the Southern Poverty Law Center, because they're the real in the field people,
[00:55:07.014 --> 00:55:09.295]  That's who I always see with their hands and the really dirty stuff.
[00:55:10.096 --> 00:55:14.138]  If you see them come out and say that and launch that play, I mean, they're in motion right now.
[00:55:14.219 --> 00:55:18.541]  Quarterback's going back, about to do a Hail Mary, and I'm like, Mayday, folks!
[00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:19.462]  They're about to do it!
[00:55:20.002 --> 00:55:21.923]  And now they're launching the ball.
[00:55:22.304 --> 00:55:23.704]  Yesterday they released the ball.
[00:55:23.764 --> 00:55:25.646]  I mean, they're definitely going for it.
[00:55:30.868 --> 00:55:37.372]  Well, if I was a Fed and could take off the next few months and had hours built up or retirement built up, I'd get the hell out of there.
[00:55:37.673 --> 00:55:41.915]  I mean, let me tell you, because I know the number one target of the globalist.
[00:55:41.996 --> 00:55:48.440]  If you see suspicious people getting out of a Ryder truck in front of your building, you better hit the ground fast.
[00:55:51.246 --> 00:55:56.447]  So what I've laid out is that I'm now, every point, and I've laid this out on record.
[00:55:56.867 --> 00:55:59.468]  If this happens, and then they do this, and then they do that, look out.
[00:55:59.668 --> 00:56:05.390]  And the exact pattern is now, all the green lights are going, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, launch, launch.
[00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:07.670]  They're turning the keys to run the operation.
[00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:14.792]  And I'm on air telling you, ladies and gentlemen, state takes extra steps to battle
[00:56:15.734 --> 00:56:22.319]  The flu in the fall deputizes citizens, others to help with vaccinations for forced inoculations, Boston Globe.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:30.385]  And then I've got... Where was my incredible headline I had during the break?
[00:56:31.186 --> 00:56:34.408]  Did I run out with that article about the... Oh, here it is.
[00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:38.651]  National Guard drill at high school prepared for possible H1N1 riot.
[00:56:39.272 --> 00:56:42.314]  National Guard takes over school in swine flu riot drill.
[00:56:42.594 --> 00:56:43.675]  That's the Sun Journal.
[00:56:45.056 --> 00:56:50.802]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:56:50.822 --> 00:56:51.342]  Number one,
[00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:08.537]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:08.778 --> 00:57:09.218]  Number 2.
[00:57:09.478 --> 00:57:14.382]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:14.682 --> 00:57:15.123]  It's true.
[00:57:15.323 --> 00:57:19.526]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:19.746 --> 00:57:20.267]  Number 3.
[00:57:20.667 --> 00:57:26.111]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:57:26.292 --> 00:57:26.512]  Number 4.
[00:57:26.972 --> 00:57:29.634]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:57:29.875 --> 00:57:33.277]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:33.537 --> 00:57:33.738]  Number 5.
[00:57:34.378 --> 00:57:38.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:43.702]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[00:57:59.858 --> 00:58:02.460]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:07.844]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:08.205 --> 00:58:09.926]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:10.246 --> 00:58:15.070]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:16.171]  How much do you want?
[00:58:16.411 --> 00:58:17.171]  When do you want it?
[00:58:17.551 --> 00:58:19.152]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:58:19.432 --> 00:58:20.253]  When will you need it?
[00:58:20.513 --> 00:58:22.573]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:58:22.693 --> 00:58:23.814]  Will there be any food?
[00:58:24.034 --> 00:58:25.375]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:58:25.575 --> 00:58:30.637]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:58:30.837 --> 00:58:33.978]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:58:34.418 --> 00:58:37.920]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:58:38.241 --> 00:58:39.221]  How much will you need?
[00:58:39.461 --> 00:58:40.082]  We don't know.
[00:58:40.362 --> 00:58:41.283]  How much do you want?
[00:58:41.483 --> 00:58:42.203]  All you can get.
[00:58:42.403 --> 00:58:43.244]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:43.504 --> 00:58:46.266]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:58:59.659 --> 00:59:07.930]  It's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:16.120]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:59:16.241 --> 00:59:16.561]  In fact
[00:59:16.581 --> 00:59:16.721]  Correct.
[00:59:16.741 --> 00:59:20.742]  Clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:59:20.822 --> 00:59:23.443]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:59:23.583 --> 00:59:34.887]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[00:59:55.313 --> 00:59:55.633]  Big Brother.
[00:59:55.653 --> 00:59:56.173]  Mainstream Media.
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:08.821]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:10.301]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.062 --> 01:00:11.962]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.982 --> 01:00:16.285]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:20.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.423 --> 01:00:25.324]  You know, Steve Quayle might be right.
[01:00:25.824 --> 01:00:26.424]  This may be it.
[01:00:26.444 --> 01:00:28.665]  We're going away and matching in one moment.
[01:00:28.745 --> 01:00:31.926]  We've got the congressman coming on either tomorrow or sometime next week.
[01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:32.927]  He's on the road right now.
[01:00:33.027 --> 01:00:34.287]  He's been on the show before.
[01:00:34.747 --> 01:00:39.449]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law and it says
[01:00:41.257 --> 01:00:52.905]  Georgia Congressman Paul Brown warned attendees of a town hall event Tuesday that the Obama administration was planning to use a pandemic or a national disaster to implement martial law in the United States.
[01:00:54.226 --> 01:01:07.255]  Speaking at the North Georgia Technical College Auditorium, Brown said the socialistic elite, as well as Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, were planning to exploit the crisis to create a favorable climate for their stalling political agenda.
[01:01:07.575 --> 01:01:09.657]  Exactly what we've been telling you!
[01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:14.543]  They're trying to develop an environment where they can take over, he said.
[01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:15.764]  We've seen that historically.
[01:01:16.004 --> 01:01:18.726]  And notice there's really seamless integration between Bush...
[01:01:19.816 --> 01:01:20.377]  And Obama.
[01:01:20.397 --> 01:01:21.898]  And I remember him saying this six months ago.
[01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:23.198]  Now it's hit mainstream news.
[01:01:23.559 --> 01:01:28.642]  Wayne Madsen's talked about the first time ever in 233 years of U.S.
[01:01:28.662 --> 01:01:34.366]  history, Cheney left a stay-behind network like NATO did when the Soviets took over.
[01:01:36.307 --> 01:01:38.188]  It's really still Cheney and Bush running things.
[01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:41.611]  I heard Madsen say that six months ago and kind of, huh?
[01:01:41.911 --> 01:01:43.472]  But now I've analyzed it.
[01:01:43.552 --> 01:01:44.213]  It's true!
[01:01:44.713 --> 01:01:47.675]  These Obama idiots have no idea what they're dealing with.
[01:01:50.725 --> 01:01:53.306]  They're trying to develop an environment where they can take over, he said.
[01:01:53.346 --> 01:01:54.607]  We've seen that historically.
[01:01:55.027 --> 01:02:06.753]  Brown's warning arrives on the backs of a letter sent to the National Governors Association to the Pentagon last week, which condemns the military's plans to usurp domestic control of National Guard and federal forces deployed in the event of a natural disaster or terror attack.
[01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:13.754]  And then it goes into Brigade's homeland, and now they say they're, quote, going to pull triggers on the American people.
[01:02:13.974 --> 01:02:21.299]  And suddenly, regular Federal Army, regular Federal Marines, running checkpoints from Tennessee to California, from Texas to Florida.
[01:02:21.379 --> 01:02:26.502]  And then I got this, and we're getting calls from Southeast Texas in Beaumont at Lamar University.
[01:02:26.882 --> 01:02:28.944]  And I confirmed there is some drill going on there.
[01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:37.009]  I confirmed, Paul Watson confirmed, got an article up, we've confirmed, National Guard drill at high school to prepare for possible H1N1 riot.
[01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:39.931]  But see, they do this.
[01:02:40.572 --> 01:02:42.894]  I know what they're going to do because I've been to their drills.
[01:02:43.374 --> 01:02:47.297]  It's like I know the sun's coming up at 6.15 because I know when the sun comes up.
[01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:48.719]  I'm not smart.
[01:02:49.279 --> 01:02:50.820]  I went to drill after drill.
[01:02:51.929 --> 01:02:58.356]  In the last 12 years and made three films and they always stage it like people want in the camp and people want the shot.
[01:02:58.416 --> 01:03:01.499]  So the troops think, oh, putting people in camps is good, they want to be here.
[01:03:01.839 --> 01:03:06.284]  Then later in the drills, in the second or third drill they do, then the people fight back.
[01:03:06.865 --> 01:03:08.827]  See, it's all meant to sell cops, it's good.
[01:03:09.187 --> 01:03:10.288]  Sell military, it's good.
[01:03:10.308 --> 01:03:13.131]  It's all written by psych warfare experts.
[01:03:14.076 --> 01:03:19.150]  Oxfords Hill Comprehensive High School will be the site of a National Guard riot control drill Thursday.
[01:03:19.491 --> 01:03:20.273]  That's today!
[01:03:20.373 --> 01:03:21.135]  Get over there!
[01:03:21.656 --> 01:03:22.378]  Get over there!
[01:03:23.919 --> 01:03:36.244]  To prepare for the event of panic over distribution of serum to treat the swine flu, the school on Route 26 in Paris, Norway town, lies has been designated by the state officials as the distribution site for H1N1 flu vaccine.
[01:03:36.264 --> 01:03:43.107]  The drill is prepared for a worst case scenario should the serum have to be transported from Augusta and people rush to get it.
[01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:44.348]  See, they did drills in Austin.
[01:03:44.568 --> 01:03:56.519]  Remember, in January, we had the emergency manager on in Indiana, where they were wanting to know where to bury millions of dead from Chicago, across the state line, and said, harden the police stations, get ready for martial law, and that's when I started saying, they're gonna use the flu!
[01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.060]  It's the flu, it's the flu!
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:03.945]  And then I got secret documents from the state of New York, we posted with numbers, later came out in mainstream news, they were real.
[01:04:04.406 --> 01:04:05.366]  We have the sources!
[01:04:06.567 --> 01:04:09.829]  I gotta get more people hired in here because we can't even go through all these documents now.
[01:04:09.849 --> 01:04:10.949]  It's just like piles of it.
[01:04:11.169 --> 01:04:13.170]  You couldn't believe how dire the situation is.
[01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:20.814]  Getting ready for millions dead in New York for something that's killed a few thousand and it's peak pandemic in the other hemisphere right now?
[01:04:21.114 --> 01:04:22.054]  Something that's nothing?
[01:04:22.235 --> 01:04:23.495]  What are they planning?
[01:04:23.655 --> 01:04:24.736]  What is going on?
[01:04:28.052 --> 01:04:29.212]  But it's just like Y2K.
[01:04:29.252 --> 01:04:36.234]  The Feds used that to build emergency FEMA bunkers everywhere, take over local government, put in their new computer systems, put in their new camera systems.
[01:04:36.554 --> 01:04:37.254]  They hyped it.
[01:04:37.294 --> 01:04:38.855]  The Navy said it was the end of the world.
[01:04:39.355 --> 01:04:44.756]  And then, they turned around and said that the people had made it up, it was no big deal, when it was the government that said it was real.
[01:04:45.056 --> 01:04:45.577]  Same thing here.
[01:04:45.597 --> 01:04:54.559]  Well, they just say, oh, we ordered 20 billion in vaccines, and you took it, and some people died from it, but, you know, and the Feds have trained you how to... Is that all that's happening, or is it bigger?
[01:04:55.319 --> 01:04:57.761]  So we're going to go over more of this, but I want to go ahead and go to Wayne Madsen.
[01:04:57.781 --> 01:05:00.723]  He's with us for the remaining 47 minutes.
[01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:03.966]  Wayne, thank you for coming on WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:05:04.206 --> 01:05:06.347]  You've heard me ranting through all of this.
[01:05:07.508 --> 01:05:11.291]  We've got major German newspapers reporting there's live cancer virus in it.
[01:05:11.651 --> 01:05:13.332]  Top scientists saying don't take it.
[01:05:13.713 --> 01:05:16.014]  Other bird flu trials are killing people en masse.
[01:05:16.054 --> 01:05:16.895]  London Telegraph.
[01:05:17.195 --> 01:05:19.237]  What on earth is going on here?
[01:05:19.764 --> 01:05:21.785]  Well, let me make you feel even better.
[01:05:21.865 --> 01:05:24.166]  Next week in Washington, there's a conference.
[01:05:24.706 --> 01:05:30.088]  I believe you had something posted about this on your website, but it's on swine flu.
[01:05:30.148 --> 01:05:35.770]  It's at the Capitol Hill Hyatt Hotel, and here's some of the breakout sessions.
[01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:38.311]  Mass fatality management planning.
[01:05:39.552 --> 01:05:41.053]  Direct fatality management.
[01:05:41.113 --> 01:05:42.513]  Tactical operations.
[01:05:42.913 --> 01:05:44.454]  Conduct morgue operations.
[01:05:44.514 --> 01:05:46.135]  Conduct final disposition.
[01:05:46.155 --> 01:05:46.975]  That's a body.
[01:05:47.436 --> 01:05:51.098]  And manage, some I can't figure, manage anti-mortem data.
[01:05:51.158 --> 01:05:52.798]  Now I know what post-mortem data is.
[01:05:52.858 --> 01:05:53.719]  That's how many people...
[01:05:54.259 --> 01:05:54.960]  We're good to go.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.941]  I'm willing to follow government orders.
[01:06:17.401 --> 01:06:26.944]  Now this is obviously being held on Capitol Hill at the Hilton because they want to get members of Congress, especially their staffers, to go to this thing.
[01:06:26.964 --> 01:06:28.225]  But this is what they're talking about.
[01:06:28.265 --> 01:06:29.985]  Continuity of operations planning.
[01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:33.046]  Disruptions to public, private, and critical infrastructure.
[01:06:33.546 --> 01:06:35.127]  Undermining essential functions.
[01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:36.848]  So there you have it.
[01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:38.248]  This is what they're talking about.
[01:06:38.308 --> 01:06:47.192]  They're talking about when H1N1 flu pandemic is unfolding, two or three successive waves in a calendar year.
[01:06:47.332 --> 01:06:53.095]  So we're talking about October as, you know, sort of ground zero, at least in North America.
[01:06:53.215 --> 01:06:54.255]  October into April.
[01:06:55.296 --> 01:06:55.916]  Right, right.
[01:06:57.970 --> 01:07:01.734]  So this is what they're talking about, and this is next week in Washington.
[01:07:01.754 --> 01:07:02.955]  I'm going to try to cover this.
[01:07:03.455 --> 01:07:16.929]  They want almost $2,000 to deregister normally, but hopefully they're going to let press in there to cover what they're talking about, because there's a lot of government people, people from the World Health Organization, people from the U.S.
[01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:19.231]  government, all scheduled to speak at this thing.
[01:07:20.916 --> 01:07:34.690]  Unbelievable, and they put that big price tag on there to make it cost prohibitive for most journalists, but you're with an international TV network and write for major publications, so they should let you in for free, just as press, but we certainly want to have you here reporting for us, Wayne.
[01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:39.875]  Wayne, you heard me rant through, as you were on hold for five minutes, all the different little tidbits.
[01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:42.277]  Congressmen saying it's a cover for martial law.
[01:07:42.998 --> 01:07:45.980]  Open announcements they're going to forcibly inoculate in lockdown cities.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:53.424]  Now that doesn't mean they're going to get away with this, but they're certainly now saying they're going to do this, and that's what level six rules mean.
[01:07:53.784 --> 01:07:56.746]  That's what the executive order now activated means.
[01:07:57.446 --> 01:08:02.769]  What is your... I know you are up at Capitol Hill, I know you're at the Press Club, I know you have sources.
[01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:05.691]  I've really become to respect and be impressed
[01:08:06.471 --> 01:08:10.594]  You're one of our best sources, Wayne, and I've really not seen you be wrong yet, which is scaring me.
[01:08:11.114 --> 01:08:14.817]  You, day one, said you had virologists that were saying it was manufactured.
[01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:16.438]  That got seconded months later.
[01:08:17.258 --> 01:08:18.579]  What is going on with this flu?
[01:08:18.639 --> 01:08:21.301]  Is it really going to kill a bunch of people, or is it...
[01:08:21.801 --> 01:08:26.004]  The excuse to bring in tyranny, is that a beta test of tyranny?
[01:08:26.325 --> 01:08:27.185]  Or is it a test?
[01:08:27.205 --> 01:08:28.526]  Do they think they'll get away with it?
[01:08:28.766 --> 01:08:33.590]  Will they go over with total control as a smokescreen for the collapsing economy?
[01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:38.273]  And use it to pass the cap and trade and the banker bailout too?
[01:08:38.333 --> 01:08:40.215]  I mean, what's going on with this?
[01:08:40.757 --> 01:08:44.999]  Well, there's two protocols that seem to be in place in reporting now.
[01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.320]  First, we heard about people being infected.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:53.343]  We got those, you know, Brazil's been hit, and then it was Panama, then it was India.
[01:08:53.723 --> 01:08:56.465]  Now we're hearing about deaths from all these various countries.
[01:08:56.485 --> 01:08:58.226]  You know, first death in Nicaragua.
[01:08:59.366 --> 01:09:09.211]  But one thing they talk about is how most, if not all, these people died because they already had a pre-existing condition.
[01:09:09.791 --> 01:09:20.941]  I'm hearing from people in the medical community that that is actually not the case for the most part, that these people walk in healthy, and in some cases, you know, a few days later they're dead.
[01:09:21.561 --> 01:09:23.803]  The other thing is undercounting the number of deaths.
[01:09:23.883 --> 01:09:28.407]  I understand from a source in Jakarta, Indonesia, which has now been hit by a
[01:09:29.928 --> 01:09:34.450]  H1N1, that the government there is actually undercounting the number of deaths.
[01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:42.274]  Yeah, the state of Texas document I got saying, we tell the public we're at level 4, we're really at level 5, in 96 hours we go to level 6.
[01:09:42.974 --> 01:09:44.135]  That was in April.
[01:09:44.415 --> 01:09:47.817]  Turned out that that was an accurate document, at least for being level 6.
[01:09:48.537 --> 01:09:50.038]  They said the deaths were much higher.
[01:09:50.778 --> 01:09:52.479]  So, continue.
[01:09:53.328 --> 01:09:58.991]  Well, I mean, at this conference next week, here's what they're going to talk about when it comes to law enforcement.
[01:09:59.031 --> 01:10:05.314]  They're going to talk about controlling and diffusing social unrest and public disorder with this swine flu.
[01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:13.779]  So it's clear that they know what's coming down the pike, unless the people putting this on are just using scare tactics to make a lot of money.
[01:10:13.799 --> 01:10:16.320]  I don't get the impression that's the case.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.681]  One thing that I kind of
[01:10:18.181 --> 01:10:27.903]  It worries me about this conference that's organized by a company that's a privately held company, and there's no information on who their corporate officials are.
[01:10:28.864 --> 01:10:32.584]  I've been here long enough to know what, possibly, it's an intelligence front.
[01:10:33.025 --> 01:10:33.965]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:10:34.005 --> 01:10:39.006]  This is all a getting all the ducks in a row operation.
[01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:49.268]  Right, and anything on Pennsylvania Avenue, as is this conference planner, if it's on Pennsylvania Avenue, that's pretty high rent, so somebody's putting a bill.
[01:10:50.313 --> 01:10:52.655]  Yeah, so we got them all getting their little minions.
[01:10:53.736 --> 01:10:59.761]  A, how to line up at the Sal's breast, and B, what talking points to cover.
[01:11:00.082 --> 01:11:01.323]  So they're getting their ducks in a row.
[01:11:02.163 --> 01:11:07.308]  But what about the mass graves they're getting ready and the forced inoculations?
[01:11:07.908 --> 01:11:11.351]  Clearly this is a federalization drill, but not just federalization.
[01:11:11.411 --> 01:11:14.094]  All over the world, it's the UN directing this.
[01:11:15.475 --> 01:11:19.076]  Well, again, I mean, you know, you look at what they're going to be talking about here.
[01:11:19.116 --> 01:11:21.397]  They're talking about enforcing quarantines.
[01:11:21.737 --> 01:11:34.341]  You know, so it's clear they're talking about, you know, airlines, restrictions on travel, restrictions at airports, border crossings.
[01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:38.283]  This is all, and then how to handle medical waste.
[01:11:38.423 --> 01:11:42.764]  I assume that includes probably dead bodies.
[01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:44.325]  You know, people have died from this.
[01:11:45.485 --> 01:11:46.186]  Wayne, we got a break.
[01:11:46.206 --> 01:11:57.071]  But when we come back, in the last two weeks that came out, they're hiring tens of thousands of additional internment and resettlement re-education officers.
[01:11:57.931 --> 01:11:58.872]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:01.323]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:06.725]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:12:06.965 --> 01:12:11.587]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:12:11.987 --> 01:12:17.049]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:12:17.549 --> 01:12:22.231]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:29.698]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:12:29.898 --> 01:12:30.799]  And here's the best part.
[01:12:31.019 --> 01:12:33.782]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:12:34.162 --> 01:12:37.385]  You actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:12:37.706 --> 01:12:40.548]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:12:40.889 --> 01:12:44.052]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:12:47.755 --> 01:12:49.457]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:12:50.638 --> 01:12:56.425]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:12:56.745 --> 01:12:59.128]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:13:01.807 --> 01:13:02.847]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:13:03.268 --> 01:13:08.749]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:13:09.309 --> 01:13:09.810]  That's right.
[01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:12.410]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:19.893]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:13:20.453 --> 01:13:28.138]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:13:28.599 --> 01:13:33.442]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:13:34.082 --> 01:13:39.066]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:39.886 --> 01:13:43.989]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:13:44.389 --> 01:13:44.649]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.572]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:13:46.652 --> 01:13:46.952]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:46.972 --> 01:13:47.533]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:00.518 --> 01:14:05.839]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.881]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:14:12.441 --> 01:14:18.603]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:14:18.863 --> 01:14:20.764]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:14:20.884 --> 01:14:23.285]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:14:23.365 --> 01:14:34.310]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:14:36.551 --> 01:14:37.832]  It's not about left or right.
[01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:39.613]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:14:40.093 --> 01:14:46.336]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:14:46.974 --> 01:14:54.740]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.381]  The Obama Deception.
[01:14:56.821 --> 01:14:58.022]  The people strike back!
[01:14:59.582 --> 01:15:03.906]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:15:04.106 --> 01:15:06.528]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:15:06.689 --> 01:15:16.237]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:15:16.357 --> 01:15:22.183]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:15:22.543 --> 01:15:25.065]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:15:25.245 --> 01:15:34.990]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years, and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[01:15:35.371 --> 01:15:45.797]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[01:15:45.937 --> 01:15:49.899]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:51.300]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.780]  ownmyself.com.
[01:15:52.941 --> 01:15:56.542]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:15:56.722 --> 01:15:59.262]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:16:04.484 --> 01:16:06.405]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:16:06.885 --> 01:16:09.626]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:16:21.269 --> 01:16:26.493]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're just addressing what the congressmen are saying about him using it for martial law.
[01:16:26.513 --> 01:16:31.197]  The forced inoculations, the mass graves were vindicated, proven right again.
[01:16:31.217 --> 01:16:38.483]  And if people would just stop denying the documents we bring forward, we would have even more political steam now to defeat this.
[01:16:39.544 --> 01:16:42.607]  If people would just check into the claims we make, we source everything.
[01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:51.079]  Instead of listening to COINTELPRO and the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center and all of them lying about us.
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.944]  There's an article up there where they're talking about how I need to be killed.
[01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:59.288]  I mean, it's really getting creepy.
[01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:02.531]  So, that's up on Infowars.com.
[01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:03.192]  We have links to them.
[01:17:03.232 --> 01:17:04.273]  These guys are bold.
[01:17:04.373 --> 01:17:05.233]  They do not like us.
[01:17:05.533 --> 01:17:07.635]  They're very upset we're raining on their parade.
[01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:09.216]  Okay, Wayne Madsen.
[01:17:09.256 --> 01:17:10.617]  I want to get into the whole Berther thing.
[01:17:10.657 --> 01:17:12.158]  You've got some inside intel on that.
[01:17:12.898 --> 01:17:17.181]  But, first off, WayneMadsenReport.com, again, is his website.
[01:17:21.061 --> 01:17:35.747]  I was bringing up the issue of the internment, relocation, re-education specialist, and people are finally waking up because it's on the Army's own website that, oh, we need jail guards for America for the Army to put whole towns in.
[01:17:35.807 --> 01:17:36.147]  Go ahead.
[01:17:37.338 --> 01:17:44.462]  Well, I mean, look, you know, you look at what Vice President Biden said as far as, you know, when he's talking about this bailout package.
[01:17:44.502 --> 01:17:53.427]  The first thing he said, the first priority was to provide more funding for law enforcement agencies, for the police around the country.
[01:17:53.927 --> 01:17:56.528]  I mean, like, we don't have enough of them.
[01:17:56.789 --> 01:18:06.754]  So it's clear that this administration is putting as much emphasis on all this domestic security nonsense as did the last one.
[01:18:07.234 --> 01:18:17.960]  And, you know, there's people out there that are really hurting, and all Biden can talk about is providing this bailout, you know, this incentive money for cops.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.001]  And I don't think they need any more money.
[01:18:22.202 --> 01:18:25.283]  What, we've had a quadrupling in police the last 15 years?
[01:18:26.244 --> 01:18:30.466]  Yeah, I just noticed that at the local Dunkin' Donuts.
[01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:35.789]  There now seems to be four times as many cop cars sitting there while they're on break than there was before.
[01:18:37.199 --> 01:18:40.301]  But then you can't get one when your house gets broken into most of the time.
[01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:43.003]  But boy, they're there with radar guns, though.
[01:18:43.544 --> 01:18:44.064]  Well, absolutely.
[01:18:44.164 --> 01:18:52.310]  They have to raise revenue for these state and county and municipal governments because the tax base is collapsing.
[01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:56.253]  So that's how they're, you know, they have to shake down the public.
[01:18:56.713 --> 01:18:57.914]  They're in their keep.
[01:18:58.975 --> 01:19:05.260]  Well, Wayne, how do you see this unfolding that you can go to the Army's own website
[01:19:07.316 --> 01:19:31.652]  and that's actually off of a hispanic job site uh... one of the links you put in internment specialist army or just national guard internment specials you can actually go to nationalguard.mil doesn't matter we'll show folks that's good enough i mean they're really gearing up the new economy is the police state the new economy all the major new grants and
[01:19:32.535 --> 01:19:34.016]  Scholarships are for this.
[01:19:34.116 --> 01:19:41.061]  Just everything's converting to private security firms and prisons and cameras owned by a few government cronies.
[01:19:41.881 --> 01:19:49.386]  I mean, I guess the government's not happy to just ship in the heroin and cocaine and put all our kids in prison and rape us and steal all our money.
[01:19:49.426 --> 01:19:52.268]  I mean, now they've got to just totally make everything a big prison.
[01:19:53.450 --> 01:20:01.537]  Well, it looks that way to me, especially with, you know, this agenda that I'm looking at here for this conference next week.
[01:20:01.697 --> 01:20:04.920]  It'll just be interesting to see who from the government is there.
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:10.184]  Even if I can't get in, I'm going to be hanging around the hotel lobby to just check those name tags.
[01:20:10.244 --> 01:20:16.850]  Because one thing about this town is they have a tendency to issue name tags for these conferences.
[01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:20.673]  And, of course, you look under the name and you can often spot what agency they're with.
[01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:22.056]  Well, what?
[01:20:22.477 --> 01:20:26.799]  I mean, I know you're there at the Press Club talking to all these other reporters and talking to intelligence people.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.341]  What's the skinning on what's coming in the fall?
[01:20:31.102 --> 01:20:35.825]  Well, the anticipation, there's actually a few threads going right now.
[01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:42.850]  There's this fear, you know, this fear that we're going to see a surge here in North America with the swine flu.
[01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:49.074]  But also there's talk about being at the end of September, of course, at the end of the fiscal year.
[01:20:49.694 --> 01:21:03.260]  And with the beginning of the new fiscal year, October the 1st, I'm hearing rumors about the economy may not recover when the commercial real estate market collapses on top of the private housing market.
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:07.681]  We may see more banks go under, and there's talk about potentially a bank holiday.
[01:21:07.741 --> 01:21:11.583]  How long it's going to last, I don't know, but just bank closures, you know.
[01:21:11.923 --> 01:21:12.904]  We're good to go.
[01:21:23.749 --> 01:21:25.030]  When we come back, I found it.
[01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:30.954]  If you just Google internment specialist by itself, the first link is GoArmy.com.
[01:21:31.495 --> 01:21:32.375]  People may have heard of it.
[01:21:32.395 --> 01:21:33.556]  It's called the U.S.
[01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:33.857]  Army.
[01:21:33.897 --> 01:21:35.898]  It's the biggest military in the world.
[01:21:36.579 --> 01:21:37.860]  I assure you it exists.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.562]  GoArmy.com.
[01:21:40.622 --> 01:21:47.046]  Now, I know popular science will say the Army doesn't exist next and there's no FEMA camps, but it's all over the news.
[01:21:47.467 --> 01:21:48.147]  There it is.
[01:21:49.889 --> 01:21:50.829]  We're on the march.
[01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:52.811]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:53.812 --> 01:21:56.613]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:59.255 --> 01:22:03.217]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:22:03.477 --> 01:22:05.277]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:22:05.498 --> 01:22:13.761]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:22:14.002 --> 01:22:19.224]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:22:19.564 --> 01:22:21.185]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:22:21.405 --> 01:22:27.728]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:22:27.928 --> 01:22:38.673]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:22:38.973 --> 01:22:39.433]  That's right.
[01:22:39.733 --> 01:22:42.055]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.
[01:22:42.315 --> 01:22:44.036]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:22:44.116 --> 01:22:44.316]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[01:22:46.958 --> 01:22:47.699]  That's A Cola Blue dot com.
[01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:04.277]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:23:04.437 --> 01:23:08.783]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:23:08.963 --> 01:23:10.806]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:23:11.246 --> 01:23:12.588]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:23:12.848 --> 01:23:13.890]  There is a solution.
[01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:22.137]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:23:36.028 --> 01:23:41.632]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:23:59.397 --> 01:24:02.318]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:24:02.478 --> 01:24:07.699]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:24:07.979 --> 01:24:13.321]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:24:13.721 --> 01:24:14.821]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:24:15.181 --> 01:24:24.124]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:24:24.224 --> 01:24:24.484]  Of course!

[01:25:09.926 --> 01:25:12.768]  ...specialty, internment resettlement specialists.
[01:25:13.409 --> 01:25:19.574]  This MOS plays an integral role in providing a uniform system of handling prisoners and detainees.
[01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:25.239]  First and always, these MPs are combat support soldiers, trained to fight.
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:37.049]  Then, also trained as internment resettlement specialists, to control and supervise detainees, to ensure their humane treatment, and to assist them in returning to a productive life.
[01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:47.519]  For this job, the Army will train you to use specialized equipment to monitor activity, to conduct searches, and to inspect areas where prisoners work and live.
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:54.045]  Here, you'll train to in-process prisoners and detainees, and to brief them on their rights.
[01:25:54.825 --> 01:26:03.174]  In addition, you'll train to inventory and secure their property, take photographs and fingerprints, issue personal items, and assign cells.
[01:26:03.854 --> 01:26:15.086]  You'll train to conduct prisoner formations and roll calls, to monitor their exercise, recreation, and work areas, to prepare and maintain records, and develop written reports.
[01:26:15.906 --> 01:26:31.841]  After your initial entry training and advanced individual training, you'll work long hours, day or night, in a garrison or field environment, where you may practice emergency procedures, detect and confiscate contraband, and escort prisoners outside the facility.
[01:26:32.502 --> 01:26:37.846]  Serving in this MOS can help you transition from the military to the civilian employment sector.
[01:26:37.867 --> 01:26:38.527]  Alright, that's enough!
[01:26:38.747 --> 01:26:40.529]  In the military police corps, you'll be...
[01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:44.272]  Now again, this all has dual use, but I've been to the training ops.
[01:26:44.372 --> 01:26:45.713]  It is for American citizens.
[01:26:45.773 --> 01:26:51.238]  And you notice, escorting you outside the base, they have the civilian inmate labor camp program.
[01:26:51.338 --> 01:26:52.539]  Secret from 86 to 97.
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:54.841]  Clinton made it declassified.
[01:26:55.441 --> 01:26:59.004]  Secret that American citizens were used as slave labor at bases.
[01:26:59.264 --> 01:27:02.547]  Here, let's just Google civilian inmate labor camp program for everybody.
[01:27:02.587 --> 01:27:04.469]  You know, for those out there in denial.
[01:27:05.407 --> 01:27:06.328]  This has been going on.
[01:27:07.249 --> 01:27:13.434]  Does that creep you out, Wayne, that they could keep these camps with citizens on them, secret, for a decade?
[01:27:13.975 --> 01:27:22.623]  Well, I mean, this whole issue of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, you know, FEMA has never operated in a very transparent mode.
[01:27:22.663 --> 01:27:29.469]  Even going back to the Reagan years, they called FEMA the secret government, and there's a lot of truth to it.
[01:27:30.670 --> 01:27:35.712]  They have these facilities around the country.
[01:27:35.832 --> 01:27:40.173]  You're not allowed to go on these facilities and see what's happening.
[01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:48.916]  The reports are there about the number of these large detention centers that have been built up around the country.
[01:27:48.976 --> 01:27:54.498]  I remember the first time I heard about this was somebody in Kern County, California.
[01:27:54.998 --> 01:27:55.759]  I don't think so.
[01:28:11.597 --> 01:28:14.841]  And just to be clear, I have the 2005 on screen right now.
[01:28:14.861 --> 01:28:15.882]  We'll keep scrolling through that.
[01:28:30.717 --> 01:28:35.780]  You've got these back to 1986 declassified so you find out more in each one.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:49.590]  The 1997 declassification admitted that they kept federal prisoners at these and brought them as slaves and the army ran them as slaves and then would pimp them out for slave labor around towns.
[01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:52.311]  So this is the new America.
[01:28:52.351 --> 01:29:00.477]  Our new job is having an illegal alien who is in the military, that's our new force, commanding a citizen around who had a crooked toenail or something.
[01:29:01.317 --> 01:29:07.581]  I mean, I have articles right here where school teachers are given $22,000 fines for using a cell phone in class.
[01:29:08.481 --> 01:29:09.982]  See, we're all prisoners now.
[01:29:11.587 --> 01:29:12.087]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:29:12.868 --> 01:29:15.770]  Well, I don't see it getting any better.
[01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:24.035]  I mean, the people I know who voted for Obama and thought there was going to be a change, I hear the term buyer's remorse quite a bit.
[01:29:25.156 --> 01:29:29.319]  I know people who were candidates for president are hearing the same thing.
[01:29:29.339 --> 01:29:32.621]  So, I mean, where's the change?
[01:29:32.881 --> 01:29:33.502]  I don't see much
[01:29:34.542 --> 01:29:34.922]  I agree.
[01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:54.231]  I want to show people from General Shoemaker's 2005 document, Civilian Inmate Labor Programs, right here on screen, providing a source of labor at no direct cost to army installations to accomplish tasks that would not be possible otherwise, due to the manning and funding constraints under which the army operates.
[01:29:54.351 --> 01:29:56.412]  Slave labor!
[01:29:56.832 --> 01:29:59.313]  These are not guys that punch their drill instructor in the nose.
[01:29:59.573 --> 01:30:01.154]  These are state and federal prisoners.
[01:30:01.834 --> 01:30:03.155]  And this is going to be you and your family.
[01:30:04.819 --> 01:30:05.479]  Sorry, Wayne, go ahead.
[01:30:06.259 --> 01:30:18.862]  Well, I mean, of course we're now hearing about Blackwater and these revelations made by these two former Blackwater employees about what was going on at the cancer network that they were running.
[01:30:18.882 --> 01:30:20.342]  I've got to stop you.
[01:30:20.962 --> 01:30:21.342]  Hold on, Wayne.
[01:30:21.383 --> 01:30:22.303]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:30:22.363 --> 01:30:22.803]  Take your time.
[01:30:22.823 --> 01:30:24.303]  Then we're going to get into the whole Berther thing.
[01:30:24.503 --> 01:30:25.463]  Let me stop right there.
[01:30:26.404 --> 01:30:28.684]  Start over, because you have a lot of sources.
[01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:31.665]  Time Magazine, for those that don't know.
[01:30:34.147 --> 01:30:49.570]  The nation and Raw Story and others have big reports that the FBI is saying this, it's in the federal documents, that Blackwater was A. Killing its own employees to cover up, arms dealing, and that's what you had said that they and others, well you'd said Merck's had been caught.
[01:30:50.131 --> 01:30:54.113]  Actually, Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst for Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[01:30:54.153 --> 01:31:04.117]  said that Mercs, he wouldn't say who, were caught bringing weapons in and actually staging attacks on the troops because it's a trillion dollar war, you gotta keep it going and have an excuse to stay there.
[01:31:04.177 --> 01:31:16.623]  So, A, go through the Blackwater revelations, the slave children they're raping, the wife swapping, the murders, whether your intel is how bad it is, but the key here that the media just mentioned as a footnote
[01:31:17.543 --> 01:31:20.186]  Who were they smuggling arms to in Iraq?
[01:31:20.806 --> 01:31:21.507]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:31:22.267 --> 01:31:36.820]  Well, it's thought in Iraq, smuggling weapons that were winding up in the hands of the Kurds, and it's thought from the Kurds they wound up in the hands of the PKK, an organization that Turkey considers to be a terrorist organization.
[01:31:37.181 --> 01:31:40.644]  An organization that the United States considers to be a terrorist organization.
[01:31:40.664 --> 01:31:41.805]  So this is all this
[01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:48.850]  You know, keeping this part of the world at each other's throats, you know, killing each other, there's profit in that.
[01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:58.317]  And companies like Blackwater and other companies, there's hundreds of them, like Blackwater, they're one of the big ones, are all involved in the same business.
[01:31:58.417 --> 01:31:59.778]  It's War Incorporated.
[01:32:00.298 --> 01:32:01.259]  And the U.S.
[01:32:01.339 --> 01:32:03.141]  is trying to get extradited from Thailand.
[01:32:03.461 --> 01:32:07.684]  There's a Russian named Victor Booth, who they're accused of being the merchant of death.
[01:32:07.724 --> 01:32:10.006]  But we've got a few of them over here, too.
[01:32:11.147 --> 01:32:20.218]  I wonder what would happen if somebody asked for the extradition of Eric Prince, the CEO of Blackwater, now called V. They changed her name to protect the guilty.
[01:32:20.238 --> 01:32:28.808]  I would imagine we would not want him extradited overseas to stand trial in some place like Iraq or Afghanistan.
[01:32:28.968 --> 01:32:29.829]  Yeah, but let's be clear.
[01:32:29.849 --> 01:32:46.264]  I mean, I want specifically because you have made allegations and revelations over the years and it's come out later mainstream media confirming that you've said contractors and the Pentagon have been caught shipping in Taliban, Al-Qaeda to kill our own soldiers to make the war look like it's real.
[01:32:47.045 --> 01:32:49.067]  And you talked about Merck's bringing in weapons.
[01:32:49.608 --> 01:32:52.210]  You're saying there's no evidence that Blackwater was doing that.
[01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.931]  This was separate.
[01:32:53.898 --> 01:33:00.940]  The company that I was told was involved in this, it was the U.S.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.322]  military, but not any specific contractor involved with bringing these people into Baghdad.
[01:33:07.362 --> 01:33:10.983]  These were Afghani Taliban who said they were there to
[01:33:11.963 --> 01:33:15.886]  You know, to basically set off road bombs and things like that.
[01:33:15.986 --> 01:33:26.674]  So, I mean, this gets in this murky area of this contracting, outsourcing by the intelligence community, the CIA, the Pentagon.
[01:33:26.694 --> 01:33:28.355]  But it's a free-for-all in Iraq.
[01:33:28.815 --> 01:33:32.878]  I've talked to people who've been over there recently.
[01:33:33.258 --> 01:33:38.262]  There has been no real improvement in the infrastructure in Iraq since we invaded that country in 2003.
[01:33:40.543 --> 01:33:44.725]  This is genocide, but that's what the federal filing and the FBI is saying.
[01:33:44.925 --> 01:34:02.873]  We're just reporting on what's being said here that Eric Prince would chastise Blackwater XC officers when they would send psychopaths home who would just enjoy killing people and raping people and that Prince would laugh and send them back
[01:34:04.073 --> 01:34:06.614]  Let's get into some of the federal allegations here.
[01:34:07.194 --> 01:34:13.416]  Raping children, pimping little girls, and then wife-swapping back at the... I mean, what's going on here?
[01:34:13.596 --> 01:34:28.900]  Well, yeah, there are these two ex-Blackwater employees who have been... who actually are testifying on behalf of the Iraqi families whose loved ones were killed by Blackwater troops in a central square in Baghdad a few years ago.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.441]  They're testifying on their behalf saying that
[01:34:32.141 --> 01:34:38.084]  Back at the North Carolina headquarters, the senior executives, there was life swapping going on there.
[01:34:38.104 --> 01:34:39.964]  No action was taken.
[01:34:40.004 --> 01:34:54.270]  There was the use of what they called a man camp in Baghdad that was basically some place where Blackwater guys would go to avail themselves of prostitutes, including child prostitutes.
[01:34:54.310 --> 01:35:01.393]  They said that people who wanted to blow the whistle on all these Blackwater scandals were threatened.
[01:35:01.733 --> 01:35:02.754]  We're good to go.
[01:35:21.463 --> 01:35:22.424]  Torture them to death.
[01:35:23.504 --> 01:35:27.086]  Army, Marine Corps investigators about missing missiles, weapons.
[01:35:27.386 --> 01:35:29.067]  They just, they just fragged them.
[01:35:29.087 --> 01:35:33.309]  I saw numbers in the thousands of fragged officers.
[01:35:33.369 --> 01:35:41.814]  I mean, this just sounds like, and that the C-130s, the New York Times admitted that everyone just uses the bathroom in buckets now and everything's collapsing.
[01:35:41.874 --> 01:35:44.395]  I mean, is this, Walter Reed's collapsing.
[01:35:44.435 --> 01:35:45.376]  I mean, is this just like
[01:35:46.553 --> 01:35:51.700]  My God, are they just... I mean, maybe the good news is they're so corrupt that everything's just going to collapse.
[01:35:52.902 --> 01:35:57.428]  Well, I mean, before these guys are returning from countries where they're eating...
[01:35:57.858 --> 01:36:02.742]  But you've seen those confirmed reports where just any good looking woman out there gets basically killed.
[01:36:26.661 --> 01:36:32.064]  Yeah, and then you know how many of those cases in Iraq where they were, you know, ruled suicide?
[01:36:32.084 --> 01:36:41.649]  You know, I put that in quotation marks because some of these people like Colonel Ted Westhusing, they said he shot himself right before he was supposed to come back to the United States.
[01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:47.932]  The Army's top ethics officer from West Point who was actually investigating contractor fraud over there at the time.
[01:36:47.952 --> 01:36:51.354]  Now his family doesn't believe for one minute he killed himself.
[01:36:51.834 --> 01:36:54.195]  So there's a lot of these so-called suicides.
[01:36:54.295 --> 01:36:55.576]  And they clearly killed Pat Tillman.
[01:36:56.195 --> 01:36:57.556]  Yeah, absolutely they did.
[01:36:57.636 --> 01:37:02.080]  And these are really, these are homicides that the military has never investigated.
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:08.265]  So I think it's time, you know, for the FBI to start investigating the Pentagon here.
[01:37:08.285 --> 01:37:11.708]  Wayne, are we the most corrupt country on earth?
[01:37:12.401 --> 01:37:19.045]  Well, I mean, there are many more corrupt countries where the system is just a kleptocracy.
[01:37:19.065 --> 01:37:21.007]  Let's look at Nigeria, for example.
[01:37:21.047 --> 01:37:24.289]  Hillary's over there today telling them they have to clean up the factory.
[01:37:24.309 --> 01:37:27.851]  Yeah, but they generally have kingpins that kind of keep it in order, though.
[01:37:28.071 --> 01:37:34.095]  I mean, here it's just like grabbing and stealing and raping and murdering and just like wild pirates or something.
[01:37:34.710 --> 01:37:35.490]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:37:35.530 --> 01:37:42.812]  I mean, there's no system to corruption and kleptocracy in this country.
[01:37:42.832 --> 01:37:53.275]  Yeah, a lot of people are stealing and killing, but we go around and parade around and say we're the greatest democracy on the planet, which is a laugh.
[01:37:54.491 --> 01:38:09.383]  Alright, I interrupt you on the hill, we have time, we'll get back into Nigeria, but the limited time we have, the main reason I got you on, I watched your Russia Today transmission, and I did notice that some of the usual suspects have really been pushing the birther issue.
[01:38:09.803 --> 01:38:21.292]  We've just looked at it, because I don't believe anything Obama says, he does have a weird Barry Sotero, weird passports, mom, you know, for the Annenberg Foundation, and Geithner's dad, and all these other
[01:38:21.812 --> 01:38:22.212]  I don't know.
[01:38:38.228 --> 01:38:48.160]  You're saying that Israel's using this birther issue to menace him, to keep him in line, that Netanyahu has either picked up on this or is behind it?
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.082]  What is your intel?
[01:38:50.643 --> 01:38:53.346]  Without naming names, where are you getting this intel from?
[01:38:54.310 --> 01:39:08.663]  Well, I mean, this issue sort of died, and then when Obama started getting tough on the settlements with Netanyahu, all of a sudden this woman, Orly Tate, out of California pops up with this Defender of Freedom Foundation.
[01:39:08.703 --> 01:39:13.588]  Now she, you know, she said that, you know, she got on television, did this big media blitz,
[01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:23.136]  She also is tied up with organizations that are linked to the Likud government and Netanyahu in Israel.
[01:39:23.397 --> 01:39:27.320]  She was born in Moldova, moved to Israel, and then came over here.
[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:32.245]  I mean, for her to be questioning
[01:39:33.285 --> 01:39:40.330]  The nationality of the President of the United States, I think somebody had to go back and see how she got in this country.
[01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:47.134]  After she makes her big allegations, two days later she pops up in Tel Aviv on television.
[01:39:47.434 --> 01:39:52.337]  Now, you know, she submitted this fake birth certificate in a lawsuit.
[01:39:52.397 --> 01:39:57.921]  Maybe she realizes that somebody must have said, even though she's a lawyer, she got her law degree apparently from some
[01:39:58.761 --> 01:40:01.322]  Some online internet university.
[01:40:02.002 --> 01:40:09.825]  But maybe somebody tapped her on the shoulder, a real lawyer, and said, you know, it's a felony to submit a non-forgery to a federal court.
[01:40:11.065 --> 01:40:16.867]  Yeah, but couldn't Israel also be putting out fake birth certificates to discredit things?
[01:40:16.947 --> 01:40:18.288]  I mean... Oh, absolutely!
[01:40:18.328 --> 01:40:23.830]  I mean, look, they had their finger... I mean, the neocons had their fingerprints all over those
[01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:27.012]  Niger Yellow Tape documents.
[01:40:27.312 --> 01:40:39.218]  They had their fingerprints on the Iraqi oil ministry documents that showed supposedly all these anti-war politicians around the world got money from Saddam Hussein.
[01:40:39.499 --> 01:40:40.639]  These were all forgeries.
[01:40:40.699 --> 01:40:50.284]  And yes, Israel specializes in forgeries because remember the motto of the Mossad is, through deception thou shalt wage war.
[01:40:50.385 --> 01:40:52.806]  So that's just another method that they use.
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:56.283]  By way of deception, we shall wage war, yeah.
[01:40:56.603 --> 01:41:13.440]  The other thing is, you've got the IDF soldier, and clearly, not even just a dual citizen, pretty much, I would say he's an Israeli, the White House Chief of Staff, the true joker here, Rahm Emanuel, and his Dr. Death eugenics brother, I mean, what a crew.
[01:41:16.997 --> 01:41:22.760]  I mean, this is just getting crazier and crazier, and so you're saying Netanyahu may be leaking this.
[01:41:24.221 --> 01:41:28.103]  I would see it just as probable that they put out the fake birth certificates to discredit it.
[01:41:28.963 --> 01:41:33.866]  I mean, why would Israel want to get rid of Obama when he's been going along with pretty much everything they want?
[01:41:34.577 --> 01:41:41.823]  Well, Obama actually has, and there's thought that there is a feud between Emanuel and Netanyahu over the settlement issue.
[01:41:42.203 --> 01:41:47.587]  But, you know... Yeah, the leaked Israeli ambassador to Washington thing in the Washington Post, yeah.
[01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:52.973]  Well, the Consul General in Boston, yeah, said that they were, you know, disturbing relations.
[01:41:53.393 --> 01:41:58.316]  I mean, and then there's, you know, seeing rabbis in handcuffs in New York and New Jersey.
[01:41:58.397 --> 01:42:08.083]  I mean, obviously, there's a feeling that the federal government is getting prepped with the Israelis, and then all of a sudden this post-certificate thing pops up.
[01:42:08.743 --> 01:42:15.007]  So, you know, Netanyahu, you know, is close to this woman, Orly Tate, who was the head of this
[01:42:15.787 --> 01:42:18.369]  The most recent operation on the birth certificate.
[01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:23.693]  So you think Obama really is a few degrees tougher on Israel than Bush?
[01:42:24.213 --> 01:42:25.834]  Oh, I believe, I believe he is.
[01:42:25.914 --> 01:42:36.882]  I mean, you never saw, you know, basically this rabbi network was supporting the Shas party, which is a key member of Netanyahu's coalition government.
[01:42:36.942 --> 01:42:39.404]  So these guys are being let out in handcuffs.
[01:42:40.578 --> 01:42:44.262]  Oh, you think that's Obama's people saying, we can blackmail you too?
[01:42:44.282 --> 01:42:45.603]  Oh, we can, yeah.
[01:42:45.643 --> 01:42:49.486]  Our Justice Department can go after your money sources over here.
[01:42:49.506 --> 01:42:51.308]  And in that case, they did.
[01:42:51.909 --> 01:42:53.931]  Wayne, tell us more about that in the final segment.
[01:42:54.251 --> 01:42:54.771]  Straight ahead.
[01:42:54.791 --> 01:42:56.293]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:02.873]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:43:03.294 --> 01:43:08.260]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.363]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:43:10.683 --> 01:43:15.449]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:16.629]  How much do you want?
[01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:17.590]  When do you want it?
[01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:19.571]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:43:19.851 --> 01:43:20.671]  When will you need it?
[01:43:20.931 --> 01:43:22.992]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:43:23.132 --> 01:43:24.233]  Will there be any food?
[01:43:24.473 --> 01:43:25.793]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:43:25.993 --> 01:43:31.055]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:43:31.255 --> 01:43:34.477]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:43:34.857 --> 01:43:38.358]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:43:38.658 --> 01:43:39.659]  How much will you need?
[01:43:39.899 --> 01:43:40.519]  We don't know.
[01:43:40.799 --> 01:43:41.700]  How much do you want?
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:42.480]  All you can get.
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:43.661]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:43:43.921 --> 01:43:46.682]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:43:46.962 --> 01:43:49.163]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:43:49.203 --> 01:43:50.183]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:44:00.063 --> 01:44:05.387]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:05.887 --> 01:44:12.913]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:44:13.453 --> 01:44:19.618]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:19.998 --> 01:44:21.879]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:22.019 --> 01:44:24.439]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:24.519 --> 01:44:35.463]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:36.083 --> 01:44:37.383]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:37.763 --> 01:44:39.144]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:39.624 --> 01:44:45.866]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:46.534 --> 01:44:54.303]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:54.803 --> 01:44:55.965]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:56.365 --> 01:44:57.567]  The people strike back!
[01:44:59.588 --> 01:45:06.569]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[01:45:06.809 --> 01:45:10.450]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:18.832]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[01:45:19.072 --> 01:45:21.772]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[01:45:21.972 --> 01:45:24.473]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[01:45:24.753 --> 01:45:25.773]  Thieves get near you.
[01:45:25.893 --> 01:45:28.975]  Push a button and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[01:45:29.195 --> 01:45:30.595]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[01:45:30.835 --> 01:45:32.716]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[01:45:32.936 --> 01:45:35.237]  Here you will find radio blocking secure sleeves.
[01:45:35.677 --> 01:45:43.020]  Simply place your credit cards and passports into these slim, lightweight sleeves and you will put a stop to anyone trying to collect your private information.
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:46.961]  For around $5 you will be protected against RFID theft.
[01:45:47.181 --> 01:45:49.502]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[01:45:49.662 --> 01:45:51.883]  That's IDStronghold.com.
[01:45:52.143 --> 01:45:52.623]  Or call 1-800-610-2777.
[01:45:54.724 --> 01:45:57.364]  Folks, Wayne Madsen is our guest.
[01:45:57.425 --> 01:46:08.847]  We've got some other big guests tomorrow.
[01:46:09.127 --> 01:46:12.407]  And, of course, open phones and a ton of important news as we track all the things that are happening.
[01:46:12.607 --> 01:46:16.028]  We're going back to Wayne here in a moment to finish up with the whole Israeli situation.
[01:46:16.728 --> 01:46:19.169]  And is this a blackmail thing going on?
[01:46:19.649 --> 01:46:21.229]  All I want is the truth, nothing more.
[01:46:22.029 --> 01:46:22.669]  As they say.
[01:46:24.410 --> 01:46:26.231]  And all we're offering is the truth.
[01:46:26.311 --> 01:46:27.152]  As best we can get at it.
[01:46:27.292 --> 01:46:27.712]  Nothing more.
[01:46:28.132 --> 01:46:29.033]  As they say in the Matrix.
[01:46:29.453 --> 01:46:33.075]  I do want to thank the sponsors that have made today's show possible before we go back to Wayne Madsen.
[01:46:33.375 --> 01:46:34.816]  Like FrontSight.com.
[01:46:35.036 --> 01:46:38.698]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:46:39.138 --> 01:46:40.259]  FrontSight.com.
[01:46:40.279 --> 01:46:47.743]  They're offering five days of firearms training to my listeners and a free handgun, XD pistol, in the caliber of your choice.
[01:46:48.303 --> 01:46:52.886]  Their August classes are filling up quickly, almost sold out, but they have a bunch in September.
[01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:54.527]  Those are filling up quickly with this deal.
[01:46:54.887 --> 01:46:56.308]  Frontside.com.
[01:46:57.648 --> 01:46:58.749]  You can't beat this deal.
[01:46:58.829 --> 01:47:04.412]  This is above law enforcement military training, with no drill instructor or macho attitude.
[01:47:04.472 --> 01:47:05.513]  It's a family event.
[01:47:05.853 --> 01:47:09.655]  There's also a lot of free stuff online at Frontside.com, so check it out.
[01:47:09.856 --> 01:47:12.637]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[01:47:12.657 --> 01:47:15.499]  Your safety, your family's safety, is paramount.
[01:47:17.671 --> 01:47:19.153]  Also, I want to thank Ecola Blue.
[01:47:19.193 --> 01:47:32.205]  This is just an awesome atmospheric water generator that then sends it through seven filters, and it's all computerized and nice and easy to use, grabs the water out of the air, condenses it in an illuminated stainless steel tank with anti-fungal, anti-UV.
[01:47:33.106 --> 01:47:33.967]  Grabs it right out of the air.
[01:47:33.987 --> 01:47:35.688]  They even sell solar panels that go with it.
[01:47:35.708 --> 01:47:41.952]  If you don't want to plug it into the wall and want to be off the grid, acolablue.com, acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, acolablue.com.
[01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:56.052]  And in closing here, I want to thank mysolarbackup.com.
[01:48:21.049 --> 01:48:22.509]  All right, the last three minutes.
[01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:22.969]  You got the floor.
[01:48:22.989 --> 01:48:31.951]  Finishing up, Wayne, with the Israeli situation and you, do you have sources or are you just saying you believe that this rabbi thing with the organs and the money and New Jersey just black hole corruption?
[01:48:47.654 --> 01:48:48.435]  Right, right.
[01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:50.077]  No, people in the U.S.
[01:48:50.157 --> 01:48:55.343]  intelligence community contacted me and said, look, this is not a coincidence.
[01:48:55.664 --> 01:48:59.308]  This is how the administration is sending a signal back to Netanyahu.
[01:48:59.328 --> 01:49:05.656]  It's basically from his nose, our request for him to freeze those settlements.
[01:49:07.478 --> 01:49:11.061]  I think we could probably play tougher.
[01:49:12.262 --> 01:49:17.187]  I would like to see more done, but I think they're going as far, probably, as we're going to see.
[01:49:17.488 --> 01:49:20.991]  Maybe they can go a little bit farther, but I really think the
[01:49:22.913 --> 01:49:37.285]  What we may see, what I'm hearing too, is that now that Netanyahu's been linked to this personal attack on President Obama, we may see somebody start digging up some stuff on Netanyahu's past, especially when he lived in the Philadelphia area.
[01:49:38.126 --> 01:49:47.233]  I'm hearing rumors that his past there may leave a lot to be desired among some of the more religious elements that support him in Israel.
[01:49:47.253 --> 01:49:48.714]  No!
[01:49:49.655 --> 01:49:50.115]  You mean a...
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:54.201]  Type of stuff that goes on in the Republicans?
[01:49:54.341 --> 01:49:59.042]  Yeah, maybe, maybe he spent a little too much time on Rittenhouse Square in downtown Philly.
[01:49:59.082 --> 01:50:05.485]  Anyone who's familiar with that area knows that that's, uh, how should I put it, a rather bohemian mixed neighborhood.
[01:50:06.245 --> 01:50:06.525]  Hmm.
[01:50:08.446 --> 01:50:10.606]  You mean a bohemian grove type stuff?
[01:50:10.706 --> 01:50:11.307]  Yeah, maybe.
[01:50:12.307 --> 01:50:12.627]  Maybe.
[01:50:12.727 --> 01:50:14.928]  Okay, Wayne Madsen, always informative.
[01:50:14.948 --> 01:50:16.448]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:50:16.908 --> 01:50:19.289]  Thank you for popping in and spending time with us today.
[01:50:19.329 --> 01:50:20.790]  I really appreciate it.
[01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:21.470]  Good to be with you.
[01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:23.309]  Wayne Madsen Report.com.
[01:50:23.369 --> 01:50:28.371]  Our websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net.
[01:50:28.611 --> 01:50:33.573]  We'll post the video of this live radio show up at PrisonPlanet.tv from the live transmission.
[01:50:33.813 --> 01:50:34.614]  Great job, crew.
[01:50:34.874 --> 01:50:35.994]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:36.054 --> 01:50:38.376]  Spread the word and don't take the flu shot!
[01:50:41.297 --> 01:50:43.898]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:43.958 --> 01:50:45.259]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:49.462 --> 01:50:54.467]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:50:54.687 --> 01:50:58.471]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:50:58.712 --> 01:51:04.318]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:51:04.618 --> 01:51:09.483]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:51:09.683 --> 01:51:10.184]  Number three,
[01:51:10.584 --> 01:51:16.011]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:51:16.872 --> 01:51:19.535]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:51:19.776 --> 01:51:23.981]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:51:24.301 --> 01:51:27.926]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:51:28.146 --> 01:51:33.629]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:38.452]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
