[00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:09.658]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:11.239]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.982]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:21.024]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:38.099]  Big show lined up for you today on this 13th day, this Thursday, the 13th day of August 2009.
[00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:44.121]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours today.
[00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:49.042]  Wayne Madsen is going to join us on a host of issues.
[00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:55.664]  Wayne Madsen Report, he also is a contributor to multiple TV, radio stations, Russia Today, you name it.
[00:00:57.213 --> 00:01:01.236]  Formerly worked with the National Security Agency, and reports from Capitol Hill.
[00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:22.331]  He'll be on about a whole host of issues, including an intriguing statement he made this week, that the Israeli lobby, well one sector of it, there's different factions, the Likudnik, Benjamin Netanyahu arm, are the ones putting out the birther information.
[00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.632]  And I actually do see a few indicators of that from a few of the usual suspects.
[00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:33.754]  So I, I mean, I want the truth.
[00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:39.936]  And so I've learned to really respect the insight and information Wayne brings out.
[00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:41.977]  So he'll be joining us in the last hour today.
[00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:45.299]  And I'm not taking sides on this.
[00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.019]  I don't believe a word Obama says.
[00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:48.460]  I didn't believe a word Bush said.
[00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:57.391]  But we do have to look at all the different angles, so we'll grill him on that and a bunch of other issues coming up.
[00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:02.494]  In fact, how long do we have him booked for?
[00:02:02.494 --> 00:02:03.215]  45 minutes, that's perfect.
[00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:05.296]  I want to make sure we have plenty of time with him.
[00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:09.719]  Maybe we should call him and go ahead and get a full hour and see if he can be at a landline, because Wayne's a great guy.
[00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:13.602]  He has a tendency to do the interviews from subway trains and things.
[00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:18.665]  So that is coming up, and we have a surprise guest that rescheduled last week.
[00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.509]  And then was set for Monday and rescheduled again today.
[00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:30.551]  Now, in my experience, when somebody's rescheduling, they'll just cancel if they're going to cancel.
[00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:36.852]  And my experience is that one of these bigwigs, they're just very busy.
[00:02:36.852 --> 00:02:38.332]  But I'm not holding my breath.
[00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:39.812]  It is a very big interview.
[00:02:39.812 --> 00:02:41.333]  I believe it at that.
[00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.173]  And I want the crew to continue, even if they reschedule today.
[00:02:44.173 --> 00:02:47.534]  I want to... It's like you get a fish up to the boat four or five times.
[00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:48.834]  I want to finally get it in the boat.
[00:02:49.973 --> 00:03:00.520]  And we'll see if it happens today.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:17.551]  You know, I have a goal, and that is to take a lot of phone calls and to break my compulsion to do hour-long, two-hour-long, three-hour-long, four-hour-long rants, diatribes.
[00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:21.979]  I have another goal, and that is to actually cover the stacks of news in front of me every day.
[00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:27.787]  I mean, I do a decent job sometimes, but most of the time, I don't.
[00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:31.452]  And so, it's gonna be an exercise in self-control.
[00:03:35.436 --> 00:03:43.861]  I am going to give 20 second answers, no matter how complex or how important your question or comment is, and I'm going to give each caller one minute.
[00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:54.627]  The problem is the first caller will call in with some huge breaking eyewitness news that will turn out to be absolutely accurate and massively important, but we'll still do that some days a week where we do nothing but guest
[00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:58.891]  Or a couple guests and then take just a few calls.
[00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:02.114]  And we'll still do some shows where I do nothing but take calls and then rant.
[00:04:02.114 --> 00:04:08.261]  But I do want to cover the news today and take your phone calls and so I'm going to do that.
[00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:21.483]  So that probably means I'll just read the headlines and give a brief comment on a story and then take calls, because there's no way to get everybody on air and then cover all the news if I don't do that.
[00:04:21.483 --> 00:04:31.467]  So, 1-800-259-9231, whatever issue you want to bring up, whatever news story, a question, a comment, you disagree with me, you agree with me.
[00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:38.391]  These town hall meetings, the flu situation coming up with the forced inoculations, and they're now openly announcing in the news.
[00:04:39.653 --> 00:04:45.940]  And a bunch of other, well, I'm going to run down some of the headlines when we get back briefly, and then we're going to take your phone calls.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.806]  We're going to take your phone calls for at least the next hour and a half.
[00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:51.407]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:51.407 --> 00:04:56.593]  I love the different angles and directions you, the listeners, take us in.
[00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:58.375]  So stand by, straight ahead.
[00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:01.286]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.286 --> 00:05:03.267]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:03.927]  Well, you should.
[00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:08.749]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:09.549]  That's right.
[00:05:09.549 --> 00:05:18.212]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:05:18.212 --> 00:05:19.573]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:19.573 --> 00:05:20.713]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:05:20.913 --> 00:05:26.897]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:33.801]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:39.325]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:40.786]  This is real.
[00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:41.846]  Don't miss out.
[00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:48.711]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:50.394]  And get your free handgun.
[00:05:50.394 --> 00:05:52.758]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:56.464]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:05:56.464 --> 00:05:59.369]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.103]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:14.686]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:20.849]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:23.250]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.750]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:37.313]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:38.993]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.993 --> 00:06:40.854]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:47.095]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:56.007]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it with super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.007 --> 00:06:57.587]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.587 --> 00:07:00.689]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:05.252]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:07:05.252 --> 00:07:07.813]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:07:07.813 --> 00:07:17.278]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:23.680]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.381]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:36.504]  So, MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years, and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[00:07:36.504 --> 00:07:46.888]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[00:07:47.048 --> 00:07:51.091]  Visit www.chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:54.073]  That's www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:55.253]  It takes very little money.
[00:07:55.253 --> 00:07:57.855]  And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:00.797]  Remember www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[00:08:00.797 --> 00:08:03.599]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:06.381]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.688 --> 00:08:26.330]  Okay.
[00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.053]  We've got Wayne Madsen joining us.
[00:08:30.053 --> 00:08:35.796]  A lot of important breaking information coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:42.501]  Are the birther movement financed by the right-wing Likudnik movement to put pressure on Obama from Israel?
[00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:46.043]  That is what he is saying and I've learned to really respect Madsen.
[00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:53.148]  And seeing a lot of what he covers ends up to be true.
[00:08:53.148 --> 00:09:05.577]  So I believe that he believes he's been given this information and he is up reporting on Capitol Hill talking to a lot of high-powered sources.
[00:09:05.577 --> 00:09:09.880]  So we'll explore that coming up in the last hour today.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.945]  We have a surprise guest coming up in two and a half hours.
[00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:27.721]  And I'm going to try to be as calm as I can today to cover as much news as possible and to take as many of your phone calls as possible.
[00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:31.563]  As soon as you hear me disconnect a caller, it is your chance to call in.
[00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:32.664]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:32.664 --> 00:09:41.590]  Now, I'm going to try to just read the headlines without giving any background information.
[00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.971]  Then I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:09:42.971 --> 00:09:47.414]  Then, starting next hour, I will start going through the top stories and fleshing them out.
[00:09:51.846 --> 00:10:02.970]  New jobless claims rise unexpectedly to $558,000 in the last month.
[00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.532]  Retail sales unexpectedly dip.
[00:10:08.532 --> 00:10:14.774]  New Jersey teacher to pay $22,000 fine for four-minute conversation during class.
[00:10:18.183 --> 00:10:25.547]  Obama posters on government property allowed anti-Obama posters called vandalism.
[00:10:25.547 --> 00:10:32.570]  Obama has called publicly for his people to put the picture of him saying change and hope on stop signs.
[00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.212]  But if you put them on your own property, people demand they be taken down.
[00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:37.753]  If it's anti-Obama, that's the new freedom.
[00:10:38.695 --> 00:10:47.120]  Exercising First Amendment now, vandalism as corporate media attacks Obama poster contest, and the people are calling for a hate crimes investigation.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.762]  Florida police say it is not a hate crime.
[00:10:50.762 --> 00:10:57.566]  And that it's the First Amendment, as long as it's hung up in a commons area.
[00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:06.731]  But if they pass the hate crimes bill completely, it's passed the House and Senate, it's now in conference, and they pass the cyberbullying, it says if someone says their feelings are hurt, you are arrested.
[00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:13.793]  Here's the big one we've had this congressman on before, Paul Brown.
[00:11:13.793 --> 00:11:16.215]  We're trying to line him up right now.
[00:11:16.215 --> 00:11:21.419]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:30.667]  And this article from PrisonPlanet.com from his quotes at a town hall meeting and interviews with newspapers is basically identical to my analysis.
[00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:36.432]  And the word is they may use this in the fall or in the winter as a martial law cover story.
[00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:43.832]  If we get the word out, we may be able to stop them doing this, but this is really going on.
[00:11:43.832 --> 00:11:47.553]  This is really happening.
[00:11:47.553 --> 00:11:50.174]  That's coming up.
[00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:59.916]  Planned for guard troops on border stalls over money, so we can have troops in 140 plus countries, but we can't have them on the border.
[00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:02.436]  That's AP.
[00:12:02.436 --> 00:12:06.377]  State takes extra steps to battle flu and fall, deputizing
[00:12:07.591 --> 00:12:13.952]  Dentist, paramedics, pharmacists to force vaccines on the public.
[00:12:13.952 --> 00:12:20.074]  This out of the Boston Globe.
[00:12:20.074 --> 00:12:24.294]  Battle erupts over plan for HIV vaccine test.
[00:12:24.294 --> 00:12:29.055]  County health officials turned down proposal last week.
[00:12:29.055 --> 00:12:36.217]  They can't find any country in the world to do this, so of course they go to the crime syndicate Chicago and even those poor people say no.
[00:12:37.409 --> 00:12:38.690]  I'm not bashing Chicagoans.
[00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.710]  There's a lot of great people.
[00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.151]  I have family lives up there.
[00:12:41.151 --> 00:12:42.632]  They're wonderful, hard-working people.
[00:12:42.632 --> 00:12:45.514]  They just have had the mafia running them for a hundred years.
[00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:51.237]  And the last place, I mean, they finally try it.
[00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:53.619]  And even our enslaved people say no.
[00:12:53.619 --> 00:12:55.040]  Thank God they're getting their soul back.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.522]  They're fighting spirit back.
[00:12:58.522 --> 00:13:00.343]  We're going to go over more of Obama's health plan.
[00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:04.747]  That's just some of the news I have, okay?
[00:13:04.747 --> 00:13:10.911]  And that dovetails with cancer viruses from dead babies in the vaccine.
[00:13:10.911 --> 00:13:12.992]  Yes, it's true.
[00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:18.015]  I'm gonna go over mainstream news.
[00:13:18.015 --> 00:13:22.878]  Ladies and gentlemen, cancer 100 years ago was very rare and almost unknown.
[00:13:22.878 --> 00:13:23.979]  By the 50s, 1 in 33 died of it.
[00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:24.619]  It's now 1 in 2.
[00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:25.380]  It was 1 in 3, now it's 1 in 2.
[00:13:28.973 --> 00:13:32.314]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Eugenics.
[00:13:32.314 --> 00:13:33.414]  That's all I'm going to say.
[00:13:33.414 --> 00:13:35.274]  We're now going to go to your phone calls.
[00:13:35.274 --> 00:13:37.695]  There's some of the news coming up.
[00:13:37.695 --> 00:13:43.076]  Tessa in Texas, first caller, welcome.
[00:13:43.076 --> 00:13:44.016]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:13:44.016 --> 00:13:45.237]  Good, welcome.
[00:13:45.237 --> 00:13:46.417]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[00:13:46.417 --> 00:13:56.299]  I don't know if you've heard anything on the news about the video that's been circulating on YouTube about Sheila Jackson Lee on her cell phone at a town hall meeting.
[00:13:57.285 --> 00:13:58.926]  Um, but I'm the one that shot that video.
[00:13:58.926 --> 00:14:00.846]  Oh, wow.
[00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:02.847]  Yeah, it's pretty much gone viral.
[00:14:02.847 --> 00:14:10.089]  It was on Grid of Ancestry last night, it was on Sean Hannity last night, and it was on Fox and Friends today.
[00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:18.932]  And, uh, basically what happened is, uh, my friend Eddie and I went to her town hall meeting, and we started, I started to film the footage.
[00:14:18.932 --> 00:14:23.334]  I do, uh, independent journalism down here in Houston, and I happened to
[00:14:24.187 --> 00:14:31.069]  Catch her on her cell phone while my friend Tracy Miller, who's one of the Tea Party rant winners down here, was asking a question.
[00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:40.731]  She's a cancer survivor and was just saying, hey, you know, I have the option to choose my health care provider and I beat this because I had that choice.
[00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:46.272]  You know, how does the Obama health care plan plan to help people like me in the future?
[00:14:46.272 --> 00:14:50.193]  And right when she did that, Sheila Jackson Lee answered a cell phone call.
[00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:51.943]  I would like to have you and
[00:15:08.362 --> 00:15:25.471]  The cancer survivor on as a 15-20 minute guest coming up sometime maybe tomorrow or on Sunday that's very very interesting and has the I have seen that that made national news just a quick question
[00:15:27.952 --> 00:15:41.855]  And that is, is the media getting the full story that it was a cancer survivor that she was ignoring, and that it was during a question, or are they just getting the fact that she was taking a phone call during questions?
[00:15:41.855 --> 00:15:46.055]  They did actually have Tracy on Grud of Ancestron.
[00:15:46.055 --> 00:15:54.797]  She was on Fox & Friends this morning, and they are covering that she is a cancer survivor, and also that Sheila Jackson Lee took the call while she was telling her story.
[00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:58.072]  And, I mean, I'm the one that shot the footage.
[00:15:58.072 --> 00:15:58.632]  I was right there.
[00:15:58.632 --> 00:15:59.673]  I couldn't even believe it.
[00:15:59.673 --> 00:16:02.834]  And, um, I mean, you can go to the Drudge Report now.
[00:16:02.834 --> 00:16:10.017]  Actually, the footage that's on the Drudge Report was put up by someone called Christie's Clips 82.
[00:16:10.017 --> 00:16:11.258]  That's not me.
[00:16:11.258 --> 00:16:13.039]  I'm Trinity, Texas, 77.
[00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:14.299]  That's my site.
[00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:16.660]  I'm the one that shot the footage, and I've got the full nine minutes.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.081]  I've got part one and part two.
[00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:21.102]  Right, where is that posted?
[00:16:21.102 --> 00:16:22.103]  Oh, I'm sorry, on YouTube?
[00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.256]  Great, so they got a Trinity 77?
[00:16:24.256 --> 00:16:27.237]  Trinity, Texas, 77.
[00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.719]  Yeah, I think I've seen that handle.
[00:16:29.719 --> 00:16:33.281]  Okay, we're going to put you on hold and get your name and number.
[00:16:33.281 --> 00:16:35.402]  Thank you, that's very interesting.
[00:16:35.402 --> 00:16:52.072]  I just want to briefly point out that with the Lloyd Doggett footage and the Congressman Castle footage, and this all started with the birther issue, and with just case after case, it is our listeners that are out there taking action, and I'm just so proud of that.
[00:16:53.356 --> 00:16:58.139]  Just like Ron Paul said during the campaign, half his support was coming from this radio show.
[00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:11.487]  That's why we're being attacked by so much COINTELPRO lying about us and trying to discredit us just like they did with Operation Chaos with the FBI back in the 60s and 70s with other activist groups.
[00:17:11.487 --> 00:17:21.673]  And then a lot of people join in on the bashing of me also just because they're eaten up with jealousy because we're successfully reaching so many people and they want to keep the Patriot Movement a small little club
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:30.404]  That's why they radicalize themselves and get into so much stuff so they can say that they're the holy ones that are exposing all the great truths.
[00:17:30.404 --> 00:17:32.545]  We are in an emergency situation.
[00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:35.326]  Our society is imploding and falling apart.
[00:17:35.326 --> 00:17:48.153]  We've all got to focus on not infighting and taking action and not letting the establishment radicalize us into violence and not letting the establishment get us into racism and not letting, that goes for black groups as well,
[00:17:49.557 --> 00:17:51.680]  It's all meant to get us fighting with each other.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.044]  We've got to come together against the New World Order.
[00:17:54.044 --> 00:17:55.646]  And see how great that call was with Tessa?
[00:17:55.646 --> 00:18:00.293]  I broke my real cup around for about three minutes, but I really want to take a lot of your calls today.
[00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:02.937]  Frances in Vancouver, you're on the air.
[00:18:02.937 --> 00:18:03.258]  Welcome.
[00:18:04.537 --> 00:18:14.586]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to drop you a quick message here about what's happening with the Winter Olympics in 2010 that's coming here and it's like a microcosm.
[00:18:14.586 --> 00:18:16.128]  Can you refresh my memory?
[00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:23.295]  I printed off two articles on Monday, mainstream headlines with the government saying martial law in Canada
[00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:45.905]  Chinese style control just like Beijing and then I saw an article two weeks ago that next time England's having the Olympics no free speech is allowed and no signs and then another country that's having the Olympics as they announce out in the future no signs even in your own home political or otherwise in fact I need to print those articles because it's so amazing
[00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:53.360]  And I'm only interrupting because I want people to understand that they're openly announcing no more free speech worldwide.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:53.661]  Go ahead.
[00:18:54.807 --> 00:18:56.248]  Well, that's exactly it.
[00:18:56.248 --> 00:19:07.895]  They're going to bring in the London-style closed-circuit TV system, the state-of-the-art one, just like you mentioned in your film, Terror Storm.
[00:19:07.895 --> 00:19:17.761]  They're going to have checkpoints all over town, our constitutional rights against unreasonable searches.
[00:19:20.222 --> 00:19:21.483]  Do you happen to have those headlines?
[00:19:21.483 --> 00:19:26.386]  I forget which papers they were in, but it was like, for your safety, martial law in Canada.
[00:19:26.386 --> 00:19:28.468]  For your safety, martial law in this country.
[00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:30.870]  And notice it's like the World Health Organization.
[00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.552]  We're under level 6, the UN's running all the nations response to the flu.
[00:19:34.552 --> 00:19:35.733]  This is international too.
[00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:37.995]  They come in and tell you what to do.
[00:19:37.995 --> 00:19:44.880]  And the country, in exchange for having the stupid Olympics that Hitler literally brought back, he drew the rings.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.021]  He drew, I mean, all of it.
[00:19:46.821 --> 00:19:48.725]  It's just a eugenic celebration.
[00:19:48.725 --> 00:19:49.246]  Stay there.
[00:19:49.246 --> 00:19:50.227]  I interrupted you, Francis.
[00:19:50.227 --> 00:19:52.151]  I'm going to give you 60 seconds on the other side.
[00:19:52.151 --> 00:19:57.520]  Then Ryan in Kentucky, Mike in Pennsylvania, Abe in Ohio.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.163]  But yeah, I mean, that's what I mean.
[00:19:59.163 --> 00:19:59.684]  It's just crazy.
[00:20:01.058 --> 00:20:10.021]  Did you know that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles, wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:12.682]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy.
[00:20:12.682 --> 00:20:14.402]  This book is for you!
[00:20:14.402 --> 00:20:19.804]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth, and it's called, Here's What You Do.
[00:20:19.804 --> 00:20:23.785]  You can buy it for only $6 at here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:26.026]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:26.026 --> 00:20:28.587]  Again, here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:29.267]  Buy it today!
[00:20:30.007 --> 00:20:31.328]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:31.328 --> 00:20:35.891]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:35.891 --> 00:20:41.714]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:41.714 --> 00:20:45.356]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:48.078]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.078 --> 00:20:53.120]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.421]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:55.962 --> 00:20:57.523]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.523 --> 00:20:57.923]  Gold.
[00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:02.624]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:02.624 --> 00:21:08.906]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:08.906 --> 00:21:13.067]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.067 --> 00:21:15.008]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.008 --> 00:21:17.449]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:17.449 --> 00:21:24.991]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:21:25.051 --> 00:21:25.792]  I think so.
[00:21:55.331 --> 00:21:57.073]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.073 --> 00:22:06.520]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:12.404]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:22:12.404 --> 00:22:18.569]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:18.829 --> 00:22:20.851]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:20.851 --> 00:22:23.333]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:23.333 --> 00:22:36.524]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:22:36.524 --> 00:22:38.206]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.206 --> 00:22:40.067]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:46.293]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:55.207]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.789]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:57.970]  The people strike back!
[00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:01.982]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:01.982 --> 00:23:08.946]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:23:08.946 --> 00:23:17.351]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:17.351 --> 00:23:23.074]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:23.254 --> 00:23:25.096]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:25.096 --> 00:23:27.398]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:27.398 --> 00:23:31.803]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:31.803 --> 00:23:34.025]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:34.025 --> 00:23:41.573]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:23:44.534 --> 00:23:45.254]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:23:45.254 --> 00:23:46.434]  Or order online, HBextract.com.
[00:23:46.434 --> 00:23:47.314]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.
[00:23:47.314 --> 00:23:47.794]  Or HBextract.com.
[00:23:47.794 --> 00:23:49.454]  It seems like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[00:24:11.305 --> 00:24:12.765]  You better enjoy your life.
[00:24:12.765 --> 00:24:18.807]  Better grab a hold of it and taste it as it goes.
[00:24:18.807 --> 00:24:23.088]  All those Christmas days are past me now.
[00:24:23.088 --> 00:24:28.449]  I've got so much more to think about.
[00:24:28.449 --> 00:24:31.570]  Deadlines and commitments.
[00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.551]  What to leave in, what to leave out.
[00:24:36.483 --> 00:24:38.425]  All right, let's go back to your calls.
[00:24:38.425 --> 00:24:42.508]  Francis, I went into a mini rant there.
[00:24:42.508 --> 00:24:45.371]  That's the kind of stuff that gets in the stack that I never even cover.
[00:24:45.371 --> 00:24:48.774]  I mean, and then people are telling me, oh, it's not as bad as you say.
[00:24:48.774 --> 00:24:52.737]  We have all these congressmen saying they're getting ready for martial law.
[00:24:52.737 --> 00:24:54.478]  This is real.
[00:24:54.478 --> 00:24:58.021]  And they just train everybody that, oh, don't worry, you'll be safe.
[00:24:58.021 --> 00:25:02.525]  Martial law, no free speech, no criticism anywhere in the city.
[00:25:02.525 --> 00:25:03.286]  Go ahead, Francis.
[00:25:04.554 --> 00:25:14.381]  Well, they're going to have checkpoints and no civil rights to privacy in your car, and it'll take three hours to do a ten-minute drive across town.
[00:25:14.381 --> 00:25:16.622]  But see, that's a precedent-setting case.
[00:25:16.622 --> 00:25:17.643]  It's all fraud.
[00:25:17.643 --> 00:25:19.324]  It's all lies.
[00:25:19.324 --> 00:25:20.264]  They just do it.
[00:25:20.264 --> 00:25:23.206]  See, that's like airports where they train you how to be a slave.
[00:25:23.206 --> 00:25:25.428]  Meanwhile, it's the government stage in most of the terror attacks.
[00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:35.282]  The thing is, it's a kleptocracy in full blast here, because originally it was budgeted to be $500 million Olympics.
[00:25:35.282 --> 00:25:37.764]  Now it's ballooned to over $10 billion.
[00:25:37.764 --> 00:25:44.649]  And the only excuse they made early on when it hit $5 billion was, oh, the price of construction materials has gone up.
[00:25:45.069 --> 00:25:48.191]  Because of the Chinese boom.
[00:25:48.191 --> 00:25:49.491]  No, everything is staffed.
[00:25:49.491 --> 00:25:50.972]  Everything hasn't gone up 22,000%.
[00:25:50.972 --> 00:25:53.293]  They're lying.
[00:25:53.293 --> 00:25:57.075]  And the corporate media here is not even investigating or reporting.
[00:25:57.075 --> 00:26:00.976]  Everybody's accepting and saying, oh yeah, it's a $10 billion plus Olympics.
[00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:02.217]  That's okay.
[00:26:02.217 --> 00:26:05.498]  It's going to be a great two-week party and they're going to bankrupt DC.
[00:26:05.498 --> 00:26:09.880]  And that's where they're going to have to sell off water rights and hydroelectric rights.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.441]  Exactly.
[00:26:11.061 --> 00:26:13.383]  He's gonna get looted by these kleptocrats.
[00:26:13.383 --> 00:26:18.127]  I figure there's two, three hundred families in this province that are just ripping the place off.
[00:26:18.127 --> 00:26:18.527]  That's right.
[00:26:18.527 --> 00:26:22.851]  They make money on the way up and money on the way down and I appreciate your call.
[00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:24.833]  And that's what's so scary, folks.
[00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:27.535]  We've never seen thieving at this level.
[00:26:27.535 --> 00:26:32.039]  But they thieve to destroy the system so that it implodes into debt to them.
[00:26:32.861 --> 00:26:38.863]  You understand, they get the money, and then you owe them interest on the money you give them.
[00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:45.825]  I mean, just like we're going to pay interest on the $23.7 trillion that we gave to the banks, to the banks.
[00:26:45.825 --> 00:26:48.365]  And they poison our water supply and laugh at us.
[00:26:48.365 --> 00:26:49.225]  Great point.
[00:26:49.225 --> 00:26:50.646]  Amazing point.
[00:26:50.646 --> 00:26:51.646]  It's all absolutely true.
[00:26:51.646 --> 00:26:55.107]  I've seen that all in the Canadian news, and they just don't care.
[00:26:55.107 --> 00:26:57.448]  They just love it.
[00:26:57.448 --> 00:27:00.749]  Let's talk to Ryan in Kentucky.
[00:27:00.749 --> 00:27:01.669]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:02.009]  Go ahead.
[00:27:02.813 --> 00:27:03.814]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:27:03.814 --> 00:27:04.074]  Good.
[00:27:04.074 --> 00:27:13.283]  You're up there where, for the last eight, nine years, they have the Army running security and they beat up any citizens that get out of line and pull 45 sidearms out on people.
[00:27:13.283 --> 00:27:14.063]  Regular Army?
[00:27:14.063 --> 00:27:17.607]  That's all part of training the slaves here, not just in Canada?
[00:27:17.607 --> 00:27:17.847]  Right.
[00:27:17.847 --> 00:27:20.009]  I actually have something coming from New York.
[00:27:20.009 --> 00:27:28.557]  I work for a major cell phone carrier in the area, or in the state, and I had a lady call in who worked for the New York City Public Health Department.
[00:27:29.205 --> 00:27:31.367]  And she's an emergency responder.
[00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:45.642]  They had a meeting a couple weeks ago that actually scared her, and she was telling me if there's an emergency in my area, or if I'm in New York, to take my identification papers with me and my family and go to the nearest school or hospital.
[00:27:45.642 --> 00:27:51.148]  So that validates everything you've said about vaccinations, about using schools for those.
[00:27:51.604 --> 00:28:05.788]  No, no, sir, they've had the fire departments and police all trained since the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act to lock down cities, to shoot anyone that leaves, and to make everyone go to local schools and sports stadiums to be forcibly injected.
[00:28:05.788 --> 00:28:08.688]  I mean, it's an absolute public fact.
[00:28:08.688 --> 00:28:10.509]  They're now gearing up to do it.
[00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:14.170]  Now, if they don't, again, they try each time, and then we say no.
[00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:28.759]  And I don't think it's going to work this time, but they may release enough of something to actually kill a bunch of people, to scare the sheep in the running to do it, and then, you know, they'll die five, ten years later of different brain degenerative disorders, cancer, viruses.
[00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:30.660]  I mean, it's just hell on earth, sir.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.361]  You can't make it up.
[00:28:32.361 --> 00:28:43.989]  And it seems like it's pretty imminent, because she seemed pretty scared enough that, because of what she called in for, she needed it fixed right away, because she could act like she could be called at any moment, like it was that imminent of a threat.
[00:28:44.895 --> 00:28:47.057]  Yeah, no, they only do that to train them.
[00:28:47.057 --> 00:28:52.080]  I mean, look, Jim Jones made his followers do Kool-Aid drills every day.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.764]  And it's meant to make it scary that, you know, we're all going to kill ourselves with Kool-Aid and they never knew.
[00:28:57.764 --> 00:29:03.448]  But after they did it hundreds and hundreds of times, when they finally drank the Kool-Aid, they weren't worried about it.
[00:29:03.448 --> 00:29:04.569]  You understand how this works?
[00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:05.767]  Exactly.
[00:29:05.767 --> 00:29:06.768]  You know, I follow it.
[00:29:06.768 --> 00:29:07.789]  I read the news every day.
[00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:08.710]  I'm on top of things.
[00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:13.113]  That's why she talked to the one person in the call center that knew exactly what was going on.
[00:29:13.113 --> 00:29:15.594]  So that's why I thought I'd bring it to your attention.
[00:29:15.594 --> 00:29:20.618]  And one last thing, August 20th, Rand Paul Money Bomb.
[00:29:20.618 --> 00:29:21.799]  Okay, thank you so much.
[00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:27.823]  I keep getting emails and things going, where's the news about cancer viruses?
[00:29:27.823 --> 00:29:32.687]  I mean, all you've got to do is go to startpage.com or Google or any of the big search engines.
[00:29:35.024 --> 00:29:46.454]  And all you've got to do is go to them and put in cancer viruses vaccines and you'll get hundreds of thousands of government documents and mainstream news.
[00:29:46.454 --> 00:29:51.117]  I mean, I've seen probably 10 or 15 this week.
[00:29:51.117 --> 00:29:52.498]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.498 --> 00:29:55.041]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.041 --> 00:29:57.723]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.762 --> 00:30:03.784]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.784 --> 00:30:09.109]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:11.150]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:16.154]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.154 --> 00:30:17.335]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.335 --> 00:30:18.456]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.456 --> 00:30:20.357]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.357 --> 00:30:21.418]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.418 --> 00:30:23.440]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.941]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.941 --> 00:30:26.482]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.482 --> 00:30:31.747]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:35.330]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.793]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.153 --> 00:30:40.373]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.373 --> 00:30:41.274]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.274 --> 00:30:42.374]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:43.314]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.314 --> 00:30:44.414]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.414 --> 00:30:47.455]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.455 --> 00:30:49.656]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.656 --> 00:30:50.716]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:50.716 --> 00:30:51.136]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:51.136 --> 00:30:53.357]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:31:07.145 --> 00:31:09.446]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:09.446 --> 00:31:13.047]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:13.047 --> 00:31:15.828]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:15.828 --> 00:31:19.009]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:26.332]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.366 --> 00:31:34.810]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.112]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.112 --> 00:31:41.234]  The Oval Bureau is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.234 --> 00:31:42.395]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.395 --> 00:31:43.195]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.195 --> 00:31:44.476]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.476 --> 00:31:45.437]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.437 --> 00:31:46.598]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:31:46.598 --> 00:31:51.361]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:31:51.361 --> 00:31:55.363]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.363 --> 00:31:58.125]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:31:58.125 --> 00:31:59.186]  You have been warned.
[00:31:59.326 --> 00:32:00.486]  Yeah.
[00:32:00.486 --> 00:32:02.527]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:32:02.527 --> 00:32:05.468]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:32:05.468 --> 00:32:07.709]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:32:07.709 --> 00:32:08.689]  Here's the story.
[00:32:08.689 --> 00:32:13.491]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:32:13.491 --> 00:32:14.751]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:32:14.751 --> 00:32:19.833]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[00:32:19.833 --> 00:32:21.674]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[00:32:21.934 --> 00:32:26.558]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[00:32:26.558 --> 00:32:32.062]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[00:32:32.062 --> 00:32:34.263]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[00:32:34.263 --> 00:32:43.270]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:48.454]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:32:48.454 --> 00:32:50.616]  I recommend you visit this important new website at
[00:32:50.856 --> 00:32:52.537]  MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:55.539]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:32:55.539 --> 00:32:57.261]  Monday through Friday we're here live
[00:33:25.289 --> 00:33:25.529]  11 a.m.
[00:33:25.529 --> 00:33:26.430]  to 3 p.m.
[00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.751]  central.
[00:33:27.751 --> 00:33:39.799]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:41.100]  Is it only an emergency?
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.784]  The globalists need a smokescreen to bring in their tyranny.
[00:33:50.507 --> 00:33:52.028]  They're social engineers.
[00:33:52.028 --> 00:33:53.489]  They're farmers.
[00:33:53.489 --> 00:33:56.211]  They see us as subhuman.
[00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:57.331]  Lower than cattle.
[00:33:57.331 --> 00:33:59.293]  They grow us.
[00:33:59.293 --> 00:34:00.333]  Like wheat.
[00:34:00.333 --> 00:34:02.294]  And they come with a sickle.
[00:34:02.294 --> 00:34:07.958]  It's even worse than that.
[00:34:07.958 --> 00:34:13.101]  They see us as a commodity with negative value.
[00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:13.922]  Wheat or corn.
[00:34:15.262 --> 00:34:16.742]  Has a value.
[00:34:16.742 --> 00:34:18.063]  They see us.
[00:34:18.063 --> 00:34:20.203]  Not as cheap.
[00:34:20.203 --> 00:34:23.204]  But as actually like a cockroach.
[00:34:23.204 --> 00:34:23.664]  A pest.
[00:34:23.664 --> 00:34:31.746]  And that's who the elite are.
[00:34:31.746 --> 00:34:32.966]  That's what they are.
[00:34:32.966 --> 00:34:34.186]  They are not the elite.
[00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.031]  I want all of you to pause.
[00:34:49.031 --> 00:34:52.713]  I want everybody to realize that we are
[00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:31.305]  Now, not at the precipice, not at the edge, we have entered the beginning of a long battle for the war inside the New World Order.
[00:35:31.305 --> 00:35:38.090]  The global government is already operating the United Nations.
[00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:44.294]  It's nothing but a vessel, a template, a front for the corporate structure.
[00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:57.822]  We are now living in a planetary government under an illegitimate, criminal, anti-human, parasitic, wicked world government.
[00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:00.765]  It has arrived.
[00:36:00.765 --> 00:36:12.235]  From the crackdowns on free speech, the crackdowns on families, freedoms, the shutdown of industry, to drive you into submission, to bankrupt you, to make you dependent on them,
[00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:25.654]  And the true battle for liberty and the great test of the human spirit is now beginning.
[00:36:25.654 --> 00:36:32.439]  And it's a good thing, because only through adversity is our metal tested.
[00:36:32.439 --> 00:36:44.788]  Only by being tested by evil does it force us to come back for reality and back to life and love and liberty and freedom.
[00:36:46.886 --> 00:36:53.647]  And to get on our knees and humble ourselves before the creator of the universe.
[00:36:53.647 --> 00:36:54.687]  It is that simple.
[00:36:54.687 --> 00:36:56.028]  All right.
[00:36:56.028 --> 00:36:58.608]  Let's talk to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[00:36:58.608 --> 00:37:00.809]  You're on the air, Mike.
[00:37:00.809 --> 00:37:01.169]  Hey, Alex.
[00:37:01.169 --> 00:37:02.449]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:37:02.449 --> 00:37:04.169]  Welcome.
[00:37:04.169 --> 00:37:08.110]  I have a question about the vaccine story that you read earlier.
[00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:14.311]  Do you think that they're doing the training to first responders and stuff to put a friendlier face on it?
[00:37:15.512 --> 00:37:15.952]  Of course!
[00:37:15.952 --> 00:37:16.353]  Of course!
[00:37:30.174 --> 00:37:34.857]  Well, the whole world is a stage and each of us players upon it.
[00:37:34.857 --> 00:37:37.718]  To paraphrase William Shakespeare.
[00:37:37.718 --> 00:37:44.302]  So the establishment is creating economic implosion, political strife, injecting the word race.
[00:37:44.302 --> 00:37:48.944]  If you don't give in to big government, you use the word socialist, you're a racist.
[00:37:48.944 --> 00:37:52.606]  So that's to create racism, create division, make it a racial issue.
[00:37:52.606 --> 00:37:54.107]  I mean, this is the racist.
[00:37:54.107 --> 00:37:55.087]  This is the racism.
[00:37:55.087 --> 00:37:56.448]  This is the tribalism.
[00:37:56.448 --> 00:37:57.649]  This is the divide and conquer.
[00:37:58.826 --> 00:38:12.775]  And then they could start riots, they could... I mean, if the media wanted to hype up a cop tasering or a cop beating, any minute they could tell people it's okay to riot, give those social signals, it would happen.
[00:38:12.775 --> 00:38:22.342]  They would then come in and crack down and have the public beg for it as Los Angeles or Detroit or Houston or New York burns.
[00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:28.466]  Or they can hype up a few thousand regular flu deaths, which they're already doing in the other hemisphere right now.
[00:38:29.886 --> 00:38:47.330]  All the major epidemiologists and virologists and doctors we talked to except for Nyman, one of them, but the vast majority say it's total hype, total baloney, genetically engineered, deadly, that the flu isn't deadly but the shots are deadly, and that it's all a big pharma takeover.
[00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.771]  I mean that's mainstream news.
[00:38:49.953 --> 00:39:01.541]  And so yes, they're going to have the local nurse, the local cop, backed up by the National Guard and the Army swinging around the heavy 50s.
[00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:06.204]  And this is what they've been training for for decades, quietly, and they have North Commonplace.
[00:39:06.204 --> 00:39:08.306]  So yes.
[00:39:08.306 --> 00:39:08.686]  All right.
[00:39:08.686 --> 00:39:11.248]  Well, answered my question pretty well.
[00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.311]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[00:39:13.311 --> 00:39:14.892]  Thank you, I appreciate the call, Mike.
[00:39:14.892 --> 00:39:17.773]  But it doesn't mean they're going to get away with it this time.
[00:39:17.773 --> 00:39:19.774]  They cry wolf on purpose.
[00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:30.081]  They put their assets in place, they come in, they scare people, and it multi-faceted engages in a PSYOP at a multi-faceted level.
[00:39:30.081 --> 00:39:31.481]  Multi-layered level.
[00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:40.607]  It conditions the police and the military and the local constabulary to go under federal and international control under level 6 World Health Organization, UN rules.
[00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:51.943]  That way when the real event happens down the road, this may be it, we don't know, then they'll go along with it because they've been drilled to do it.
[00:39:51.943 --> 00:39:57.851]  And the public's been drilled, the public's been conditioned, the public's been scared into submission to go along with this.
[00:40:01.877 --> 00:40:08.722]  And then at the same time, whenever we get up and resist it and say, no, don't take the shots, you don't have to take the shots.
[00:40:08.722 --> 00:40:11.865]  It's grown on dead fetal tissue.
[00:40:11.865 --> 00:40:13.526]  It's got cancer viruses in it.
[00:40:15.154 --> 00:40:20.379]  And then the pandemic doesn't come, even though they've announced a level six four months ago.
[00:40:20.379 --> 00:40:26.804]  Then when it doesn't materialize, we get the blame and the media doubles back and says, we never said there would be an emergency.
[00:40:26.804 --> 00:40:28.546]  We never said there'd be martial law.
[00:40:28.546 --> 00:40:31.228]  This crazy man, Alex Jones, says it.
[00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:32.909]  They actually put that in the news.
[00:40:32.909 --> 00:40:39.115]  When all I'm doing is reading to you from the newspapers as they're saying it, going, this is how the PSYOP works.
[00:40:41.696 --> 00:40:46.617]  So see, there's... because the public is mesmerized or in a trance, literally.
[00:40:46.617 --> 00:40:49.097]  The brainwave patterns show that in major studies.
[00:40:49.097 --> 00:40:50.017]  We've gone over them.
[00:40:50.017 --> 00:40:54.318]  The public, from watching so much TV, is in a lower state of consciousness.
[00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:55.799]  And I don't mean that in some new age term.
[00:40:55.799 --> 00:40:57.679]  I mean actual brainwaves.
[00:40:57.679 --> 00:40:58.359]  They're asleep.
[00:40:58.359 --> 00:41:00.119]  People say their eyes are glazed over.
[00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:00.899]  They are.
[00:41:00.899 --> 00:41:02.680]  They're in a trance.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:09.461]  That's why when you do something out of the ordinary or do something that they're not accustomed to seeing, you'll see them become shocked.
[00:41:11.724 --> 00:41:31.334]  I mean, when I dressed up in a Joker outfit last week to promote this contest and got out of my car to a group of three police cars with four policemen, they looked stunned and scared and freaked out because they were in a form of mind control under the television and the culture, never expecting to see something like that except on television.
[00:41:31.334 --> 00:41:40.298]  But their subconscious mind saw it as real because of watching these different films, then when they saw me step out of the car out of nowhere, it really freaked them out.
[00:41:42.719 --> 00:41:46.142]  And see, for a minute, they were no longer in a trance.
[00:41:46.142 --> 00:41:49.905]  That's what I did it for, was to break people out of their trance.
[00:41:49.905 --> 00:41:55.029]  I'm learning more and more about how the enemy operates, but I'm using their own systems to try to unlock people.
[00:41:55.879 --> 00:41:57.580]  Not to believe in what I believe.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:06.887]  If you notice, I just show you how they operate and how their tricks work, so you can see it for yourself, and then that's prima facie, absolute first-hand evidence for you.
[00:42:06.887 --> 00:42:22.059]  When you find out they're lying, when you find out they're trying to hypnotize you, when you find out the flicker right on the TV in government patents is designed to do it, when you find out the info babe talking in a certain cadence is designed to do this, they are trained to do this.
[00:42:23.243 --> 00:42:26.744]  We are all in this together under attack from the globalists.
[00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:28.845]  Abe in Ohio, welcome.
[00:42:28.845 --> 00:42:30.005]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:42:30.005 --> 00:42:31.246]  Good, sir.
[00:42:31.246 --> 00:42:38.308]  Alright, well I was calling because you talked about the federalization at the local level and our newly elected sheriff in our county here,
[00:42:39.471 --> 00:42:46.797]  I wanted to go in and have a talk with him, because he's, like, ex-not-high-ranking military, but he was definitely, like, a lieutenant in the military.
[00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:52.101]  Yeah, they're all former military, and I say all, almost all, former military, former FBI, former DEA.
[00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:54.102]  They've quietly taken everything over.
[00:42:54.102 --> 00:43:00.087]  Then they get to control the local drug routes, bust who doesn't pay the cut, support those that do pay the cut.
[00:43:00.087 --> 00:43:01.608]  They get to shake down the citizens.
[00:43:01.608 --> 00:43:02.509]  It is a business.
[00:43:02.509 --> 00:43:04.270]  These men are farmers.
[00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:05.912]  They are growing us.
[00:43:05.912 --> 00:43:07.112]  They are milking us.
[00:43:07.112 --> 00:43:07.493]  Go ahead.
[00:43:08.305 --> 00:43:27.921]  Well, I went in and talked to him, and I'm just like, uh, I don't want to name his name, but, uh, I'm just like, so, uh, under martial law, like, if it does happen, because, I mean, President Bush signed an executive order under any national emergency, martial law, and it's still stamped under Obama, what are you going to do if the President has a black list or, I guess, an execution list or a detainee list?
[00:43:27.921 --> 00:43:35.047]  And he just kind of laughed at me like I was kind of crazy, and he's just like, well, if you're asking me if martial law is induced, by all means, I'm going along with the President's orders.
[00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:39.073]  Yeah, but see, that's a double thing.
[00:43:39.073 --> 00:43:42.937]  He's laughing at you, even though he knows guaranteed all about this.
[00:43:42.937 --> 00:43:43.959]  See?
[00:43:43.959 --> 00:43:44.980]  I mean, they'll laugh.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.844]  The Nazis would laugh as they sat there shooting people in the back of the head.
[00:43:48.844 --> 00:43:49.966]  They would laugh at them begging.
[00:43:49.966 --> 00:43:54.231]  It's all real funny how they've stolen everything and gang-raped the Republic.
[00:43:54.878 --> 00:43:59.824]  He's also got five or six new cruisers.
[00:43:59.824 --> 00:44:01.526]  He got a brand new cruiser for himself.
[00:44:01.526 --> 00:44:07.333]  He hired something like ten new county deputies.
[00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:08.695]  It's getting pretty nuts.
[00:44:08.695 --> 00:44:10.417]  Yeah, Homeland Security funded all that.
[00:44:11.055 --> 00:44:11.535]  Yeah, I know.
[00:44:11.535 --> 00:44:12.756]  I saw that.
[00:44:12.756 --> 00:44:13.637]  It's crazy.
[00:44:13.637 --> 00:44:15.879]  Which is bank rape security.
[00:44:15.879 --> 00:44:20.522]  This is so the banks can just absolutely gut us, break our back.
[00:44:20.522 --> 00:44:21.943]  They're killing America.
[00:44:21.943 --> 00:44:23.124]  And these guys line up.
[00:44:23.124 --> 00:44:25.486]  They all got American flags on their walls.
[00:44:25.486 --> 00:44:26.667]  They enjoy the club.
[00:44:26.667 --> 00:44:29.029]  They enjoy the coke and heroin money.
[00:44:29.029 --> 00:44:34.013]  Again, they have to make the drugs illegal so they can control the black market and make the profit.
[00:44:34.013 --> 00:44:35.374]  It is elementary.
[00:44:36.326 --> 00:44:40.967]  And so I tell everybody, the young people, do not use drugs.
[00:44:40.967 --> 00:44:42.987]  You want to defeat the New World Order?
[00:44:42.987 --> 00:44:44.428]  Don't use any of it.
[00:44:44.428 --> 00:44:49.268]  Legal, illegal, prescriptions, cigarettes, none of it.
[00:44:49.268 --> 00:44:50.569]  None of it.
[00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:52.269]  Do not use their product.
[00:44:52.269 --> 00:44:55.630]  And don't put your kids in their government camps where they push the drugs on them.
[00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:57.350]  Don't use any of it.
[00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:58.470]  You want to stop them?
[00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.870]  Don't use any of it.
[00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.291]  It's not cool.
[00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:02.671]  It's how they enslave you.
[00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:03.011]  Go ahead.
[00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:12.393]  Well, that's also the reason why they are saying for the, like, pick-up-and-cops, the number of cops and new cruisers, is because there's been a huge flux of heroin in our area.
[00:45:12.393 --> 00:45:13.314]  Of course!
[00:45:13.314 --> 00:45:18.578]  I mean, the BBC admits, but then says, but it's, they have, you know, the British and U.S.
[00:45:18.578 --> 00:45:22.561]  forces have to guard the poppies, and yes, it's up more than twelvefold now.
[00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:25.023]  It was eightfold, now it's twelvefold what it was.
[00:45:25.023 --> 00:45:28.706]  Record opium being turned into heroin, flooding the world,
[00:45:30.287 --> 00:45:36.732]  But they have to guard it, because they said if they don't guard it, the Taliban will come in and take over and sell it.
[00:45:36.732 --> 00:45:45.559]  So the government has to guard it and let the farmers sell it, or the Taliban will, because that's how they get the people on their side.
[00:45:45.559 --> 00:45:48.901]  Folks, the Taliban works for the New World Order.
[00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:49.902]  I appreciate your call.
[00:45:49.902 --> 00:45:50.662]  It's just so sick.
[00:45:51.523 --> 00:45:52.564]  It's so sick.
[00:45:52.564 --> 00:46:09.874]  Young people, I know Hollywood and Pulp Fiction and all these movies, they make drugs cool, then you use it and there's money involved and it's radical and it's avant-garde and it's taboo and you're at the party and the older kids invite you in to snort the cocaine.
[00:46:09.874 --> 00:46:11.455]  Do not use it!
[00:46:11.455 --> 00:46:14.978]  You are crushing the enemy when you don't use their filth!
[00:46:15.638 --> 00:46:19.188]  Don't use these fat-bellied cops' drugs, you understand me?
[00:46:19.188 --> 00:46:23.900]  Don't use these fat-bellied CIA murdering bastards' drugs, you understand me?
[00:46:25.356 --> 00:46:28.218]  Because it isn't enough for these murderers now.
[00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:32.442]  Now all the Dyncor and the Halliburtons and it's in federal filings.
[00:46:32.442 --> 00:46:40.909]  The FBI is now going after XC Blackwater for taking the little girls and they're flying them around in the world.
[00:46:40.909 --> 00:46:42.790]  See what you government people have done.
[00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:53.339]  You go ahead and you accept shipping the drugs in, which you set up the CIA out of Yale to do, because it's admitted Skull & Bones was founded with the opium money in 1834.
[00:46:57.452 --> 00:46:59.873]  That's how they run this whole thing.
[00:46:59.873 --> 00:47:02.054]  The British East India Company had a monopoly on that.
[00:47:02.054 --> 00:47:07.916]  They lost their monopoly in the 20s, so they made it illegal so they could have the monopoly again.
[00:47:07.916 --> 00:47:08.757]  That's right.
[00:47:08.757 --> 00:47:12.978]  The opium importers had a monopoly in the U.S.
[00:47:12.978 --> 00:47:17.200]  and they lost it by the 20s because of transportation and expanded shipping lines.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:23.483]  So they just made it illegal so that only they could ship it in and make even more profits.
[00:47:23.483 --> 00:47:26.424]  It's elementary, my dear Watson.
[00:47:29.093 --> 00:47:32.175]  And Skull and Bones at Yale was founded off the opium money.
[00:47:32.175 --> 00:47:34.556]  That's mainline ABC News.
[00:47:34.556 --> 00:47:36.037]  Throwing it in your face.
[00:47:36.037 --> 00:47:37.998]  Do not use any of it.
[00:47:38.735 --> 00:47:41.716]  Don't use any of their drugs.
[00:47:41.716 --> 00:47:43.236]  None of them!
[00:47:43.236 --> 00:47:44.997]  Don't take their filthy Prozac.
[00:47:44.997 --> 00:47:46.597]  Don't take their filthy Ritalin.
[00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:48.398]  Don't take their filthy vaccines.
[00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:50.398]  Don't snort their filthy cocaine.
[00:47:50.398 --> 00:47:52.379]  Don't inject their filthy heroin.
[00:47:52.379 --> 00:47:54.179]  Don't take any of it.
[00:47:54.179 --> 00:48:00.441]  And I know George Washington grew marijuana and smoked it for stomach aches and sold it to the local apothecaries.
[00:48:00.441 --> 00:48:02.442]  That's the local drug stores.
[00:48:02.442 --> 00:48:03.722]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.043]  That stuff is clearly abused and overused by people.
[00:48:10.043 --> 00:48:17.809]  There's zombies walking around and 87% of drug users only use that so they use it to get you in their system.
[00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:19.911]  Don't use it either!
[00:48:19.911 --> 00:48:21.352]  Break their back!
[00:48:22.393 --> 00:48:23.854]  Rake their back.
[00:48:23.854 --> 00:48:26.295]  Don't use any of their trash.
[00:48:26.295 --> 00:48:28.155]  Quit drinking their alcohol.
[00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:29.136]  All of it.
[00:48:29.136 --> 00:48:34.117]  You want to go to the hill country or wherever you live and buy some local wine or something and support local people?
[00:48:34.117 --> 00:48:34.938]  That's different.
[00:48:34.938 --> 00:48:37.039]  Don't use their big corporate brands.
[00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:39.039]  None of it!
[00:48:39.039 --> 00:48:43.481]  Never, never, never, never, never, never.
[00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:46.322]  I'm talking to the 12 and 13 year olds listening.
[00:48:46.322 --> 00:48:50.584]  You're going to end up being the cool person in your school when you say, I'm not going to use that government product.
[00:48:50.584 --> 00:48:51.424]  They ship that in.
[00:48:53.991 --> 00:48:56.012]  Oh, you filth.
[00:48:56.012 --> 00:49:01.215]  Let's go ahead and talk to KJ in Florida.
[00:49:01.215 --> 00:49:02.997]  Alex, great show.
[00:49:02.997 --> 00:49:03.817]  Thank you very much.
[00:49:03.817 --> 00:49:06.399]  I also could add a point to your last point there.
[00:49:06.399 --> 00:49:09.080]  Nebromine was on alcohol and drugs.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.522]  It got so much into his brain he just killed himself, you know.
[00:49:12.677 --> 00:49:14.279]  So there's an example there for the kids.
[00:49:14.279 --> 00:49:19.864]  I wanted to bring up some good news to add to what you and Steve Quayle were talking about yesterday.
[00:49:19.864 --> 00:49:25.169]  If enough people get down and repent, you know, great things can happen.
[00:49:25.169 --> 00:49:26.190]  I can give you some examples.
[00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:32.236]  You probably know the story about Lepanto, that big naval upset the Christians over the Turks back in 1571.
[00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:35.539]  The Pope actually, at the time, he asked people to
[00:49:37.362 --> 00:49:40.563]  They had a Rosary Crusade going back then.
[00:49:40.563 --> 00:49:47.025]  There's actually one going on right now, a certain order in the church is asking people to get down on their knees and say the rosary.
[00:49:47.025 --> 00:49:59.669]  Have you seen the picture in Hiroshima where there was one building survived, it was about eight blocks from ground zero, and there was four priests and they were completely unscathed, no radiation burns, nothing.
[00:49:59.669 --> 00:50:00.789]  Have you seen that picture?
[00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:01.289]  Yes.
[00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:03.710]  Was the church cross on top?
[00:50:05.011 --> 00:50:16.720]  No, they've been examined by like 250 scientists, and these scientists couldn't come up with an answer, you know, and these guys, the priest said, hey, we just said the rosary every day, we follow the message of Fatima.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.281]  The Blessed Mother asked us to do so.
[00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:20.683]  That's all I wanted to tell you about today.
[00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:23.471]  Alright, I appreciate your call, KJ.
[00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:24.152]  Good to hear from you.
[00:50:24.152 --> 00:50:27.274]  Thomas, Blake, Michael, Thomas, and others.
[00:50:27.274 --> 00:50:29.356]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:50:29.356 --> 00:50:29.616]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:29.616 --> 00:50:30.076]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:30.076 --> 00:50:37.082]  We're doing pretty good.
[00:50:37.082 --> 00:50:40.884]  But now, I'm really going to start blitzing your calls.
[00:50:40.884 --> 00:50:43.366]  One minute apiece.
[00:50:43.366 --> 00:50:45.748]  When we come back, so you can get your points out.
[00:50:45.748 --> 00:50:47.249]  That's how we get this real variety.
[00:50:47.249 --> 00:50:47.890]  Spin the wheel.
[00:50:49.648 --> 00:50:55.992]  All these different ideas, topics, angles coming up, never know what you'll hear next, and it's all thought-provoking, and that's the key.
[00:50:55.992 --> 00:50:58.693]  Breaking your conditioning, getting outside the box.
[00:50:58.693 --> 00:51:00.694]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.694 --> 00:51:07.278]  eCigarettesNational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[00:51:07.278 --> 00:51:08.939]  It's called the eCigarette.
[00:51:08.939 --> 00:51:13.522]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[00:51:13.522 --> 00:51:15.283]  But because this is not a cigarette,

[00:52:01.104 --> 00:52:06.928]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:06.928 --> 00:52:14.514]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.514 --> 00:52:20.679]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.039 --> 00:52:23.061]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:25.563]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.563 --> 00:52:37.153]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.815]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.815 --> 00:52:40.676]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.676 --> 00:52:46.922]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:54:14.945 --> 00:54:15.145]  Ooh!
[00:54:15.145 --> 00:54:19.007]  They pointed cannon at you.
[00:54:19.007 --> 00:54:24.430]  Congressman Obama, used pandemic to declare martial law.
[00:54:41.664 --> 00:54:48.510]  You've got two brain cells to rub together and you've studied history and you've studied NORTHCOM and what they've been setting up.
[00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:50.391]  We're already under world government control.
[00:54:50.391 --> 00:54:55.956]  The UN and private corporations have fully bankrupted the country by design.
[00:54:55.956 --> 00:54:58.658]  They're just bankrupting us even more now.
[00:54:58.658 --> 00:55:02.621]  Putting the paramilitary police around us and they are going to treat us something fierce.
[00:55:03.382 --> 00:55:06.163]  They're going to give us some really cruel treatment.
[00:55:06.163 --> 00:55:08.063]  And I got news for the local constabulary.
[00:55:08.063 --> 00:55:09.764]  We're sick of your drug dealing.
[00:55:09.764 --> 00:55:11.344]  We're sick of all your corruption.
[00:55:11.344 --> 00:55:13.765]  It's over.
[00:55:13.765 --> 00:55:15.625]  It's over.
[00:55:15.625 --> 00:55:22.267]  And all I hope for is that no matter what happens to me in this, that the scum is brought to justice.
[00:55:22.267 --> 00:55:25.087]  I can't believe how far this country's fallen.
[00:55:25.087 --> 00:55:30.609]  But we got a bunch of sleep at the switch public who's sucking their thumbs and not aware of what's going on in the world.
[00:55:31.584 --> 00:55:35.362]  Alright, I'm going back to Blake, Michael, Nicholas, John, Doug, and others.
[00:55:39.284 --> 00:55:52.927]  Here in just a moment, I do just want to add to listeners that we do have in the black t-shirts, the white t-shirts, with fascistinfowars.com and New World Order under the Obama Joker face.
[00:55:52.927 --> 00:56:00.669]  They are in, they are shipping out, and the establishment says it's evil and bad to lampoon him in any way, and that it's wrong.
[00:56:00.669 --> 00:56:05.430]  Well, just on the face of that, we're all forced to wear these shirts now, just as a protest.
[00:56:06.423 --> 00:56:13.826]  And I'm going to be wearing mine when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in one hour and four minutes.
[00:56:13.826 --> 00:56:15.627]  The last two hours today.
[00:56:15.627 --> 00:56:21.449]  So order your Obama fascist joker shirts, InfoWars.com shirts.
[00:56:21.449 --> 00:56:25.371]  They have end the Fed on the back, wake up before it's too late on the back, stop the criminal.
[00:56:25.371 --> 00:56:31.073]  Eight different variants of black and white t-shirts that have the joker, the iconic joker image.
[00:56:31.073 --> 00:56:35.515]  And I did want to take some time out to thank everybody and for the
[00:56:37.248 --> 00:56:46.834]  I haven't counted, it's probably 60, 70, 80, I don't know, page after page at Contest at Infowars.com, all the different videos we've been sending.
[00:56:46.834 --> 00:56:53.137]  And then I found other contest videos that haven't been sent to us yet, so I don't know if folks have just heard about the contest but haven't seen the email.
[00:56:53.137 --> 00:56:59.141]  It seems like there's folks out there doing the contest who haven't really read the contest because they're not doing it exactly right, or
[00:57:00.822 --> 00:57:01.142]  I don't know.
[00:57:01.142 --> 00:57:02.423]  I get blamed for now.
[00:57:02.423 --> 00:57:05.344]  The original socialist signs that are all over L.A.
[00:57:05.344 --> 00:57:06.805]  We did not start this campaign.
[00:57:06.805 --> 00:57:08.986]  We never claimed we started this campaign.
[00:57:08.986 --> 00:57:16.950]  Good job to whoever did, but there's a lot of people hanging up Obama as Hitler.
[00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:20.091]  That's actually Lyndon LaRouche doing that.
[00:57:20.091 --> 00:57:21.512]  They put a Hitler mustache on him.
[00:57:21.512 --> 00:57:22.913]  That's his First Amendment right.
[00:57:22.913 --> 00:57:26.694]  I think it's pretty accurate in a lot of respects, but I'm getting blamed for that now.
[00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:32.888]  Let's go ahead and put one out of him as Hitler, because if I'm going to get the blame, I might as well.
[00:57:36.408 --> 00:57:44.233]  I mean, okay, you say I did it, okay, let's put a Hitler, let's put an Obama-Hitler t-shirt out, because I have a right as a U.S.
[00:57:44.233 --> 00:57:46.075]  citizen to expose this guy.
[00:57:46.075 --> 00:57:53.420]  I exposed George Bush and I did put images of him as Hitler out, because he was Hitlerian, and I'm going to put an Obama-Hitler out.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:54.881]  You don't like the Obama Joker?
[00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:56.642]  You're going to blame me for the Obama-Hitler?
[00:57:56.642 --> 00:57:59.384]  That's it, I'm putting an Obama-Hitler flyer out.
[00:57:59.384 --> 00:58:00.825]  You want something really offensive?
[00:58:01.525 --> 00:58:03.808]  You can't handle him as a joker, as a criminal?
[00:58:03.808 --> 00:58:05.229]  How about as Hitler?
[00:58:05.229 --> 00:58:12.718]  He did expand the funding and re-unfreeze the funding to kill black babies in Africa with forced abortion and in China.
[00:58:12.718 --> 00:58:14.860]  That's a fact!
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:19.926]  He does have a White House science czar that says kill the majority of the public.
[00:58:19.926 --> 00:58:21.068]  Does say poison the water.
[00:58:22.506 --> 00:58:23.747]  So good!
[00:58:23.747 --> 00:58:27.491]  I didn't put the Hitler-Obama poster out, but I am now.
[00:58:27.491 --> 00:58:30.293]  You think it gets to me, criticizing me and threatening me?
[00:58:30.293 --> 00:58:32.475]  That only makes me get up earlier in the morning.
[00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:34.097]  That only puts a spring in my step.
[00:58:34.097 --> 00:58:35.838]  Because I'm a fighter!
[00:58:35.838 --> 00:58:37.540]  And the American people are fighters!
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.641]  And we're awake now!
[00:58:38.641 --> 00:58:42.344]  Yeah!

[00:58:50.143 --> 00:58:55.450]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:59.976]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:59.976 --> 00:59:02.259]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:02.259 --> 00:59:03.881]  You don't have to cooperate.

[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.862]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.862 --> 01:00:11.442]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:13.003]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:17.184 --> 01:00:21.246]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.435 --> 01:00:39.355]  Wide open phones.
[01:00:39.355 --> 01:00:46.717]  Prominent member of Congress says it looks like Obama's going to use the flu as a pretext for a martial law takeover.
[01:00:46.717 --> 01:00:51.118]  They want to do AIDS virus vaccine tests in the U.S.
[01:00:51.118 --> 01:00:55.138]  Ladies and gentlemen, African, even African countries on the payroll have said no.
[01:00:55.138 --> 01:00:56.319]  China has said no.
[01:00:56.319 --> 01:01:02.640]  No one, I've been watching this last five years or so, will do any of these vaccine trials that Bill Gates wants with the AIDS vaccine.
[01:01:03.649 --> 01:01:08.352]  Which has, in other little smaller trials, has caused a lot of death.
[01:01:08.352 --> 01:01:10.514]  Just like Gardasil.
[01:01:10.514 --> 01:01:10.994]  Guess what?
[01:01:10.994 --> 01:01:14.476]  They're trying to force kids and people in Chicago to do it.
[01:01:14.476 --> 01:01:18.259]  Because we are seen as the morons of the earth in this country.
[01:01:18.259 --> 01:01:20.901]  The cattle that'll put up with anything.
[01:01:20.901 --> 01:01:26.384]  Look, I'm not like a tomato on a vine for the government to come by and pull it off and start eating me.
[01:01:26.384 --> 01:01:26.805]  I'm done!
[01:01:27.705 --> 01:01:30.026]  Understand, I'm done with all your baloney.
[01:01:30.026 --> 01:01:35.189]  I don't care if government people are drinking your own Kool-Aid and believe that, you know, you're not out of control.
[01:01:35.189 --> 01:01:38.330]  You're out of control, people!
[01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:45.614]  And you fools in government that see me as the enemy, they're putting sodium fluoride in your water, Jack.
[01:01:45.614 --> 01:01:47.655]  They're putting stuff in your vaccines, too, Bubba.
[01:01:47.655 --> 01:01:50.416]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and take your calls.
[01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:51.877]  Blake in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:01:51.877 --> 01:01:52.818]  I'm trying not to get mad.
[01:01:52.818 --> 01:01:53.178]  Go ahead.
[01:01:54.028 --> 01:01:56.030]  Hey Alex, good to be with you.
[01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:59.472]  I'm taking summer school at the University of Beaumont, Texas.
[01:01:59.472 --> 01:02:09.460]  Last week, Tuesday of last week, I was outside waiting for my geology class to start and out walked the Texas National Guard in full military gear.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.922]  I go inside and I'm kind of curious about it.
[01:02:11.922 --> 01:02:14.424]  I asked my teacher, what's going on with the military here at the school?
[01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:18.934]  You said, oh, they're running the latest GPS tracking drills here at the campus.
[01:02:18.934 --> 01:02:20.835]  They're just running drills.
[01:02:20.835 --> 01:02:23.336]  Well, I go outside of class after class is over.
[01:02:23.336 --> 01:02:27.218]  The whole entire military that they have there on campus is just marking everything.
[01:02:27.218 --> 01:02:30.039]  Cars, light poles, everything in sight.
[01:02:30.856 --> 01:02:35.098]  Yesterday I go back to my class and I said, what exactly are they training for?
[01:02:35.098 --> 01:02:42.700]  And one of my professors was actually help training the soldiers in a drill that was for disaster preparedness.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:47.642]  Yeah, I know, they're marking our homes, they're marking the universities, it's where they're going to hold people.
[01:02:47.642 --> 01:02:49.443]  People keep asking where the camps are.
[01:02:49.443 --> 01:02:50.383]  It's declassified!
[01:02:50.803 --> 01:02:56.567]  It's sports stadiums and anything with a barbed wire fence around it, and top-off, and now they're called NLE.
[01:02:56.567 --> 01:03:01.431]  Before they were called top-off exercises, now they're called NLEs, national-level exercises.
[01:03:01.431 --> 01:03:08.256]  They admit they're training to lock down cities, set up machine gun points, and forcibly shoot us up.
[01:03:08.256 --> 01:03:08.917]  Okay?
[01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:12.379]  There's no... This is not me saying this!
[01:03:12.379 --> 01:03:14.401]  They're really... It's really happening!
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:23.884]  But again, they use that military tactic of denying, denying, denying when they're openly training foreign troops.
[01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:26.886]  FEMA has announced they're openly shutting all this up.
[01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:30.188]  They openly are having gun confiscation drills in the newspaper.
[01:03:30.188 --> 01:03:34.990]  And then when we say we don't want it, they suddenly say we're crazy and it doesn't exist.
[01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:40.933]  So, I mean, did your professor working with them understand how serious this was?
[01:03:40.933 --> 01:03:41.854]  Apparently not.
[01:03:41.854 --> 01:03:44.535]  She seemed to, you know, just think it was, you know, just
[01:03:45.236 --> 01:03:47.058]  You know, a part of everyday life.
[01:03:47.058 --> 01:03:51.982]  They're actually, I went to the last day of school today and they were still running drills up there today.
[01:03:51.982 --> 01:03:59.228]  Why don't you go shoot video and go up and say, so where is the training for the flu pandemic?
[01:03:59.228 --> 01:04:00.409]  That's how you trick them.
[01:04:00.409 --> 01:04:04.232]  And they'll say, that'll be Colonel Johnson or whatever his name is.
[01:04:04.232 --> 01:04:06.554]  That'll be Captain Thompson.
[01:04:06.554 --> 01:04:07.795]  Yes, we are.
[01:04:07.795 --> 01:04:09.577]  And say, well, what about the holding area?
[01:04:10.726 --> 01:04:11.147]  Yeah, I do.
[01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:20.696]  And another funny thing, when this happened last week, before I realized what was going on, all these soldiers were huddling up around their commander getting ready to do this drill.
[01:04:20.696 --> 01:04:24.660]  And I was standing right there, just going into class.
[01:04:34.013 --> 01:04:36.594]  And he was saying, you know, don't engage the students.
[01:04:36.594 --> 01:04:38.054]  They shouldn't be hostile.
[01:04:38.054 --> 01:04:45.697]  I don't think in a way of violence or anything, but, you know, he was, you know, conditioning them to, you know, think that we were going to be hostile toward them in some way.
[01:04:45.697 --> 01:04:46.357]  Of course!
[01:04:46.357 --> 01:04:47.718]  No, I mean, look.
[01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:53.220]  I've been to the drills where they put the American citizen down on their knees, stick the gun to the back of their head, and blow their head off.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:53.700]  In the drill.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.321]  They trained to kill the American people.
[01:04:55.321 --> 01:04:57.361]  Period.
[01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:57.702]  Stay there.
[01:04:57.702 --> 01:04:58.562]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:05:00.213 --> 01:05:04.454]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:05:04.454 --> 01:05:06.454]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:05:06.454 --> 01:05:14.976]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:05:14.976 --> 01:05:20.518]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:05:20.518 --> 01:05:22.138]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:05:22.378 --> 01:05:28.902]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:05:28.902 --> 01:05:39.949]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:05:39.949 --> 01:05:40.409]  That's right.
[01:05:40.709 --> 01:05:43.272]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:45.094]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:05:45.094 --> 01:05:45.354]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:05:45.354 --> 01:05:47.917]  Or visit a Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:05:47.917 --> 01:05:48.558]  That's Ecolablue.com.
[01:06:00.148 --> 01:06:01.510]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:03.512]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:06:03.512 --> 01:06:04.493]  Well, you should.
[01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:08.998]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:09.799]  That's right.
[01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:18.469]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:06:18.469 --> 01:06:19.810]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:20.972]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:06:21.152 --> 01:06:27.137]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:06:27.137 --> 01:06:34.042]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:06:34.042 --> 01:06:39.566]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:06:39.566 --> 01:06:41.027]  This is real.
[01:06:41.027 --> 01:06:42.088]  Don't miss out.
[01:06:42.088 --> 01:06:48.953]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[01:06:49.173 --> 01:06:50.636]  And get your free handgun.

[01:06:53.002 --> 01:06:56.710]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:59.616]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[01:07:00.814 --> 01:07:03.817]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:03.817 --> 01:07:09.161]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.161 --> 01:07:11.203]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.203 --> 01:07:16.207]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:16.207 --> 01:07:17.388]  How much do you want?
[01:07:17.388 --> 01:07:18.509]  When do you want it?
[01:07:18.509 --> 01:07:20.391]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:20.391 --> 01:07:21.472]  When will you need it?
[01:07:21.472 --> 01:07:23.674]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:23.674 --> 01:07:25.015]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:25.015 --> 01:07:26.336]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:07:26.536 --> 01:07:31.797]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:07:31.797 --> 01:07:35.378]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:07:35.378 --> 01:07:39.199]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:07:39.199 --> 01:07:40.419]  How much will you need?
[01:07:40.419 --> 01:07:41.319]  We don't know.
[01:07:41.319 --> 01:07:42.419]  How much do you want?
[01:07:42.419 --> 01:07:43.360]  All you can get.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.460]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.501]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:49.781]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoods.com.
[01:07:55.263 --> 01:08:06.111]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.111 --> 01:08:08.452]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:08.452 --> 01:08:15.658]  Coming up, Congressman says Obama can use pandemic to declare martial law.
[01:08:18.064 --> 01:08:21.165]  That's exactly what we've been breaking down.
[01:08:21.165 --> 01:08:36.032]  And he said the final piece of the puzzle would be if they announced that militias are about to carry out terror attacks and reintroduced all the 1990s propaganda.
[01:08:36.032 --> 01:08:46.276]  And I've been saying that for months and now they've made the announcement and have had the Southern Poverty Law Center out there putting out their propaganda attacking me and others.
[01:08:48.522 --> 01:08:51.083]  So it's now beginning.
[01:08:51.083 --> 01:09:02.927]  And the only way they can really make the general public the enemy, and have the general public still accept that and make themselves the enemy, in the name of safety, is to use a pandemic to do it.
[01:09:02.927 --> 01:09:05.628]  But I think they're going to overlay it with some staged terror.
[01:09:05.628 --> 01:09:11.329]  That's why they've been drilling the National Guard and regular army, mainstream news.
[01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:13.050]  The latest article was in Missouri.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:23.906]  Where they practice setting up checkpoints, and then, quote, the militias come and attack the checkpoints.
[01:09:23.906 --> 01:09:28.829]  And the checkpoints are for flu.
[01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:30.991]  Now, this doesn't mean they're going to do this, though.
[01:09:30.991 --> 01:09:33.172]  I don't see them being able to get away with it.
[01:09:33.172 --> 01:09:36.254]  Steve Quayle says this is it.
[01:09:36.254 --> 01:09:37.115]  And I hope he's wrong.
[01:09:39.784 --> 01:09:41.645]  And maybe we will go under the waves.
[01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:49.647]  Maybe we'll submit like they did to Hitler, or the Russians did to Lenin and Stalin, or to Mao in China, and that may be it.
[01:09:49.647 --> 01:09:56.710]  And there will be black uniforms and this, hunting us down one by one, and raping our wives, and killing our kids, and this is what governments do normally.
[01:09:57.772 --> 01:09:58.673]  And this is the crew.
[01:09:58.673 --> 01:10:00.314]  I mean, they mean business.
[01:10:00.314 --> 01:10:02.976]  They mean business 110%.
[01:10:02.976 --> 01:10:07.799]  With their illegal alien, and their criminals, and their felons, and their foreign troops they've hired.
[01:10:07.799 --> 01:10:09.621]  Mainstream news for years.
[01:10:09.621 --> 01:10:12.103]  Giant contingents of foreign troops.
[01:10:12.103 --> 01:10:15.305]  Not foreign military units, though they have those.
[01:10:15.305 --> 01:10:21.329]  It's just our military's foreigners now.
[01:10:21.329 --> 01:10:25.452]  Now I want to go back to the caller, Blake, and we're going to go to Michael, Nicholas, John, Doug, Tim, and others.
[01:10:25.452 --> 01:10:26.353]  Before I do that, though,
[01:10:29.747 --> 01:10:32.789]  I do want to pause and thank some of the sponsors that are making this show possible.
[01:10:32.789 --> 01:10:34.870]  New Silver Solution.
[01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:38.131]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits of supernatural silver.
[01:10:38.131 --> 01:10:44.914]  This powerful new nanotechnology is a natural antibiotic and a preventative against infectious germs and diseases.
[01:10:44.914 --> 01:10:49.917]  Silver is one of the oldest natural antibiotics and is non-toxic.
[01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:54.379]  Visit their new link on InfoWars.com and see the studies for yourself.
[01:10:54.379 --> 01:10:56.040]  You've heard the medical doctors here say it's a
[01:10:57.577 --> 01:11:00.699]  Good for bacteria and viruses.
[01:11:00.699 --> 01:11:02.720]  You cannot afford to miss this opportunity.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:09.003]  It is essential for your emergency preparedness needs, and it is a great way to protect your family and friends.
[01:11:09.003 --> 01:11:12.205]  You can't put a price tag on your family's health, and it's also very inexpensive.
[01:11:12.205 --> 01:11:14.906]  It's Supernatural Silver.
[01:11:14.906 --> 01:11:17.187]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:11:17.187 --> 01:11:19.849]  Visit them today to see this new technology.
[01:11:19.849 --> 01:11:22.390]  It's a new, even more nano size.
[01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:25.792]  The smaller the silver, the better, and this is just absolutely microscopic.
[01:11:27.506 --> 01:11:31.029]  Go and watch the testimonials and you'll see what I have seen.
[01:11:31.029 --> 01:11:38.635]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today or click on the link on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to make sure you have the first line of defense.
[01:11:38.635 --> 01:11:40.677]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:11:40.677 --> 01:11:43.119]  Also, we all need to be self-sufficient.
[01:11:43.119 --> 01:11:45.881]  I mean, I do have firearms for defense.
[01:11:45.881 --> 01:11:50.044]  I do have silver and gold and I do have storable foods and a lot of them.
[01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:54.428]  And I do have little propane tanks and cook stoves and I've even got
[01:11:57.421 --> 01:12:02.244]  A couple little chemical toilets in case I need them.
[01:12:02.244 --> 01:12:11.951]  You know, things like that, folks, because if they do release some deadly flu, and it is killing a bunch of people, it's probably just going to be a regular no big deal flu, but if they shut down the U.S.
[01:12:11.951 --> 01:12:15.273]  for two deaths, imagine what we'll do for 2,000.
[01:12:15.273 --> 01:12:20.957]  During the hysteria or whatever's happening, I'm going to lock down my house and just stay there.
[01:12:20.957 --> 01:12:23.179]  I was having debates with my wife last night about whether
[01:12:24.022 --> 01:12:35.111]  I'll just come live at the office if there is some pandemic so I can work and operate from here and she can stay home and make sure the kids don't get it and die.
[01:12:35.111 --> 01:12:36.051]  But again, we don't know.
[01:12:37.045 --> 01:12:39.466]  Whether it's going to be real or whether they're going to launch this.
[01:12:39.466 --> 01:12:43.446]  We just know these people are terrorists, financial terrorists, medical terrorists.
[01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:44.827]  We know they're taking over.
[01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:49.288]  I mean, the army admits they take their own troops and put them in chambers and nerve gas them to death.
[01:12:49.288 --> 01:12:50.108]  Project Shad.
[01:12:50.108 --> 01:12:51.828]  I mean, this is admitted.
[01:12:51.828 --> 01:12:53.909]  I'm sorry reality's so crazy.
[01:12:53.909 --> 01:12:57.549]  I mean, I'm just here telling it like it is.
[01:12:57.549 --> 01:12:59.690]  And the truth of it is, is just because I'm a wild man.
[01:13:00.546 --> 01:13:05.648]  I mean, most people, I don't understand why, cower to all of this or lie to themselves.
[01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:20.172]  I mean, I'm just somebody who has got enough hillbilly left in me that when I see a bunch of criminals taking over and circling around me and my family, I get my hackles up.
[01:13:20.172 --> 01:13:23.913]  The analogy is I'm like a dog, folks, and we all need to be like this.
[01:13:23.913 --> 01:13:27.294]  A dog, if it sees a creepy person walking around behind the house, starts barking.
[01:13:27.924 --> 01:13:32.532]  And I mean, we got creepy, sick liars running everything that think we're their slaves.
[01:13:32.532 --> 01:13:36.599]  And I just, can we just get some backbone that a dog has?
[01:13:36.599 --> 01:13:38.162]  Can we have the smarts of a dog?
[01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:41.830]  Anyways, I'm going to shut up.
[01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:43.871]  The point is, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:13:43.871 --> 01:13:45.312]  You need to get storable foods today.
[01:13:45.312 --> 01:13:52.236]  This is the high quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid place to get it where you get your food quick and the food was recently packaged in the last month.
[01:13:52.236 --> 01:13:53.896]  They have their own big factory, high quality.
[01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:55.177]  It's where I got my food.
[01:13:55.177 --> 01:13:56.197]  I said, this is high quality.
[01:13:56.197 --> 01:13:57.938]  This other stuff I bought is junk.
[01:13:57.938 --> 01:14:00.159]  That's why I called them up and said, please be a sponsor.
[01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:02.160]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:02.941]  Okay, I'm done.
[01:14:09.844 --> 01:14:11.925]  Going back, finish up, Blake.
[01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:35.420]  I need somebody, tell them the university, I know this is in the news going on everywhere, but we all get conditioned to these National Guard, State Guard, regular feds, Alabama Defense Forces, setting up random checkpoints, even searching three-year-olds, training everybody to be a slave, it's all part of acclimation, but specifically, you said they were getting people ready for, you know, the students to cause a problem.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.821]  So this is what they're drilling them for.
[01:14:38.479 --> 01:14:41.040]  Can somebody go shoot some video and get it up on YouTube?
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.381]  Tell us the school, tell us where it's going on.
[01:14:44.381 --> 01:14:47.281]  We're at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas.
[01:14:47.281 --> 01:14:54.323]  Ironically, that's the same place where at the Texas Academy of Sciences, Dr. Pianka gave his brilliant speech.
[01:14:54.323 --> 01:15:00.165]  Also, this is supposedly some of the newest GPS steady art tracking devices.
[01:15:00.165 --> 01:15:00.585]  Apparently,
[01:15:02.263 --> 01:15:07.208]  They can track, you know, if they mark something, even if it moves, they can still track it.
[01:15:07.208 --> 01:15:10.951]  Like I said, the geologists, they're helping these guys do this.
[01:15:10.951 --> 01:15:15.134]  I guess some of their technology for marking like fossils and different rock layers and things like that.
[01:15:15.134 --> 01:15:24.022]  And she also said, in addition to it being, you know, for disaster preparedness, it was also for rescue efforts.
[01:15:24.022 --> 01:15:28.506]  So when the disaster happens, they can find people easily to rescue them.
[01:15:32.847 --> 01:15:34.588]  Tell me more.
[01:15:34.588 --> 01:15:39.032]  Um, that's basically, uh, the gist of it.
[01:15:39.032 --> 01:15:41.593]  This happened last Tuesday.
[01:15:41.593 --> 01:15:48.939]  I was standing out, um, smoking a cigarette, getting ready for class, and out walks the National Guard in full military gear.
[01:15:48.939 --> 01:15:54.983]  Um, they had orange vests, and then they were just going out and marking everything in sight with these GPS tracking devices.
[01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.765]  They were working in groups of two.
[01:15:56.765 --> 01:16:00.988]  They would go out for about an hour or two, and then come back into the classrooms and analyze what they had.
[01:16:01.838 --> 01:16:11.384]  Um, like I said, the only really, the reason I really know that is because one of my teachers was running, uh, the drill, and, uh, you know, that's what's going on.
[01:16:11.384 --> 01:16:21.691]  You know, she said it's for disaster preparedness this fall, and it's for rescue efforts, and I overheard the military commander saying the students shouldn't be hostile, don't engage them, and it was just really weird.
[01:16:21.691 --> 01:16:26.654]  You know, I was just going to class to learn about dinosaur bones or something, and this happened, so I thought I'd give you a call.
[01:16:29.454 --> 01:16:34.260]  Well, somebody needs to take a video camera out there and shoot some video of this.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:41.468]  They now sell a lot of videos that are designed to upload to the web that are high quality and cost like $150.
[01:16:41.468 --> 01:16:43.951]  Or even it's low quality for $45, $50.
[01:16:43.951 --> 01:16:45.493]  Get one.
[01:16:45.493 --> 01:16:46.654]  Get it out.
[01:16:46.654 --> 01:16:49.077]  And this is going on all over the country just like they have
[01:16:50.424 --> 01:16:55.892]  The National Guard out and the regular Army and Marines running checkpoints for drunk drivers.
[01:16:55.892 --> 01:16:57.715]  And then people say, why is the Army here?
[01:16:57.715 --> 01:16:58.657]  Why are the Marines here?
[01:16:58.657 --> 01:17:00.760]  And they go, you're not for drunks, are you?
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.022]  They kill children.
[01:17:02.022 --> 01:17:04.646]  This is word for word state police in California.
[01:17:06.348 --> 01:17:08.190]  And see, oh, it's for disaster.
[01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:15.636]  And see, they'll even have the troops out fighting forest fires and things like that, reasonable stuff, but it sets the precedent.
[01:17:15.636 --> 01:17:17.578]  I appreciate your call, Blake.
[01:17:17.578 --> 01:17:19.520]  Let's talk to Michael in Illinois.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.722]  You know what, I bet it's even in the local paper.
[01:17:21.722 --> 01:17:28.188]  You can check Lamar University, Beaumont, Southeast Texas.
[01:17:28.188 --> 01:17:31.731]  Hartman, if you Google Lamar University,
[01:17:32.876 --> 01:17:36.017]  University Beaumont Texas State Guard Drills.
[01:17:36.017 --> 01:17:37.878]  I bet it'll come up.
[01:17:37.878 --> 01:17:39.478]  Thank you so much Blake.
[01:17:39.478 --> 01:17:41.239]  Michael, go ahead from Illinois.
[01:17:41.239 --> 01:17:44.860]  Hey Alex.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:55.484]  I watched a video recently and it showed German troops actually doing search and seizures in America and I was really worried about this because they have a video on it.
[01:17:55.484 --> 01:17:57.105]  It used to be on YouTube.
[01:17:57.105 --> 01:18:00.206]  It was taken off and it actually showed a person
[01:18:01.035 --> 01:18:02.276]  Yeah, and I have a lot of family in New York.
[01:18:29.179 --> 01:18:37.684]  And so I went to visit New York and I accidentally, I came upon a concentration camp and I've never seen one before and I saw one on a highway.
[01:18:37.684 --> 01:18:43.007]  It was sort of like deserted, but the fences were huge and it was just incredible.
[01:18:43.007 --> 01:18:45.669]  We'll shoot some video of it.
[01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:47.810]  Shoot some video of it.
[01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:49.171]  Okay.
[01:18:49.171 --> 01:18:49.991]  Thank you, Michael.
[01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:51.472]  Good to hear from you.
[01:18:51.472 --> 01:18:53.473]  Let's now go to Nicholas in Florida.
[01:18:53.473 --> 01:18:54.134]  Nicholas, go ahead.
[01:18:57.349 --> 01:18:58.569]  Hello there, Alex.
[01:18:58.569 --> 01:19:00.470]  Hello, welcome.
[01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:02.490]  Hi there, this is Nick.
[01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:08.072]  I operate the Thoughtful Cibo channel on YouTube, and I'm a new member of We Are Change Florida.
[01:19:08.072 --> 01:19:08.952]  Great, welcome, sir.
[01:19:08.952 --> 01:19:10.513]  What's on your mind?
[01:19:10.513 --> 01:19:13.433]  Well, I guess this was the day to call.
[01:19:13.433 --> 01:19:15.474]  So much has just struck home with me.
[01:19:15.474 --> 01:19:19.615]  I'm a big proponent of survival, and I'm very anti-New World Order.
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:31.067]  Um, as a survivor, um, I have also survived a form of modern eugenics, uh, known as forced psychotropic drugging.
[01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:36.350]  Oh yeah, well they got 20% of the public on it and they want to get 50% in their new freedom initiative.
[01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:38.031]  That's what it's all about.
[01:19:38.031 --> 01:19:41.053]  Tell you what, stay there, I'll give you another minute on the other side, then I'm going to move the next person.
[01:19:41.053 --> 01:19:43.295]  So folks, have your questions, your comments ready.
[01:19:45.199 --> 01:19:47.962]  Finish up with Nicholas and John, Doug, Tim and others.
[01:19:47.962 --> 01:19:49.203]  Dana, 1-800-25-99231.
[01:19:49.203 --> 01:19:55.729]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:57.851]  We the people have the power.
[01:19:57.851 --> 01:20:00.033]  So if we speak out, this program's gonna fail.
[01:20:00.794 --> 01:20:06.758]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[01:20:06.758 --> 01:20:07.519]  Think about that.
[01:20:07.519 --> 01:20:10.641]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[01:20:10.641 --> 01:20:13.864]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[01:20:13.864 --> 01:20:23.651]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Choose for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.
[01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:29.936]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[01:20:29.936 --> 01:20:31.117]  The choice is yours.
[01:20:31.117 --> 01:20:36.722]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[01:20:36.722 --> 01:20:37.742]  Choose for Health.
[01:20:37.742 --> 01:20:41.786]  The world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[01:20:41.786 --> 01:20:44.248]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.
[01:20:44.948 --> 01:20:48.371]  1-800-210-1922.

[01:20:52.855 --> 01:20:53.075]  1-800-210-1922.
[01:20:53.075 --> 01:20:53.976]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[01:21:00.612 --> 01:21:01.412]  Gold.
[01:21:01.412 --> 01:21:02.933]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:02.933 --> 01:21:09.217]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:09.217 --> 01:21:13.399]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:13.399 --> 01:21:15.340]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:17.762]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:17.762 --> 01:21:24.906]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every year.
[01:21:24.906 --> 01:21:25.767]  We're good to go.
[01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:46.572]  Call 800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[01:21:46.572 --> 01:21:49.472]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:55.654]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:21:55.654 --> 01:21:56.674]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.609 --> 01:22:06.411]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:06.411 --> 01:22:13.993]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:22:13.993 --> 01:22:20.155]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:20.575 --> 01:22:22.556]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:22.556 --> 01:22:25.057]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:25.057 --> 01:22:36.622]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:36.622 --> 01:22:38.303]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.303 --> 01:22:40.164]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:46.407]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:55.337]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:56.921]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:56.921 --> 01:22:58.103]  The people strike back!
[01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:07.496]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[01:23:07.496 --> 01:23:11.460]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:19.767]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[01:23:19.767 --> 01:23:22.670]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:25.172]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[01:23:25.452 --> 01:23:25.592]  I think?
[01:23:55.492 --> 01:23:56.713]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[01:23:56.713 --> 01:23:58.014]  It was back when the country was strong.
[01:24:33.948 --> 01:24:39.552]  My friends, the greatest fortunes are made by taking over governments.
[01:24:39.552 --> 01:24:43.495]  That's why John D. Rockefeller I said competition is a sin.
[01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:44.736]  These are monopoly men.
[01:24:44.736 --> 01:24:48.318]  They want control of societies.
[01:24:48.318 --> 01:24:48.839]  Period.
[01:24:53.106 --> 01:24:54.826]  They want you under their control.
[01:24:54.826 --> 01:25:01.007]  They want you on drugs, in prison, with a psychiatric designation, in debt.
[01:25:01.007 --> 01:25:03.648]  They want you dependent.
[01:25:03.648 --> 01:25:07.088]  And so Madison Avenue makes you feel inadequate.
[01:25:07.088 --> 01:25:08.369]  They tell you to go into debt.
[01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:10.049]  They tell you drugs are cool.
[01:25:10.049 --> 01:25:12.049]  They sell you death.
[01:25:12.049 --> 01:25:12.910]  Wake up!
[01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:15.130]  Awaken!
[01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:17.150]  Alright, Nicholas, go ahead in one minute.
[01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:20.031]  Okay, so they force you to take psychotropic drugs.
[01:25:20.031 --> 01:25:20.571]  Right, right.
[01:25:21.877 --> 01:25:29.259]  Basically, I ended up having to trick my captors to become free of the psychotropic drugging after eight months of being forced drugged.
[01:25:29.259 --> 01:25:30.100]  What did you do?
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:33.201]  Act like you were submitting and you liked it?
[01:25:33.201 --> 01:25:42.244]  Well, the thing is they had me on forced Haldol injections, and so that was every month being forced to be injected with an unknown substance.
[01:25:42.244 --> 01:25:44.425]  Really, it could have been anything as far as I know.
[01:25:46.613 --> 01:25:54.156]  And so what I ended up doing was saying, you know, I'd like to have my physician do that because he lives closer.
[01:25:54.156 --> 01:26:05.799]  And so I basically forbade them to share information back and forth and, in essence, got free from the drugging and have lived a very simple and fulfilling life.
[01:26:05.799 --> 01:26:06.099]  Good.
[01:26:06.099 --> 01:26:08.080]  You defeat them when you do that.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.060]  God bless you, Nicholas.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.441]  You defeat them when you live well.
[01:26:11.328 --> 01:26:13.070]  The French say the best revenge is living well.
[01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:14.311]  I agree with them.
[01:26:14.311 --> 01:26:18.975]  But I'll change that and say you defeat the scum, control freak, parasites.
[01:26:18.975 --> 01:26:21.257]  That's why you've got to be straight and strong and focused.
[01:26:21.257 --> 01:26:22.618]  And I'm not saying I'm perfect.
[01:26:22.618 --> 01:26:30.666]  I'm just saying we've all got to try to really be straight and strong and just keep our nose clean and reach out and expose these people.
[01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:36.389]  I wanted to call when I heard the gentleman say that he had just come back from talking to his county sheriff.
[01:26:36.389 --> 01:26:40.012]  I found that interesting because, frankly, that's where I was this morning.
[01:26:50.467 --> 01:26:57.513]  I started going into the internment camp enlistments that I got off the website there for NationalGuard.com.
[01:26:57.513 --> 01:27:05.900]  Guys, the Army officially says for internment camps in America, re-education of the American people, mainstream news, and what did he say?
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.981]  It didn't exist?
[01:27:06.981 --> 01:27:09.302]  Oh no, no, no, no, no, not at all.
[01:27:09.302 --> 01:27:13.426]  He looked at it and all of a sudden he started handing me stuff.
[01:27:14.287 --> 01:27:14.587]  Oh.
[01:27:14.587 --> 01:27:22.049]  That his nephew, who is in the military, has been sending him about gun confiscation.
[01:27:22.049 --> 01:27:23.930]  So... Oh, boy.
[01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:26.291]  So all of the sudden, it's like... Well, let me stop you.
[01:27:26.291 --> 01:27:26.871]  Let me stop you.
[01:27:26.871 --> 01:27:33.513]  I want to shut up, and I want to give you time to break down the whole story, but see, all the sheriffs and police chiefs aren't criminals.
[01:27:33.513 --> 01:27:35.033]  I'd say about half of them are.
[01:27:35.033 --> 01:27:40.475]  So the criminals are trying to have a full takeover right now so they can get away with what they're doing and expand it.
[01:27:40.475 --> 01:27:42.696]  So the good news is, just like I got the DHS report,
[01:27:43.456 --> 01:27:50.020]  From a state police officer, just like I get the Homeland Security report from a federal marshal or FBI people.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.082]  I'm not going to go into any more than that.
[01:27:52.082 --> 01:27:59.006]  Or from the Army, I get secret documents that then expose and make national news that they're following in the fetters.
[01:27:59.006 --> 01:28:01.928]  You're telling me you went in and the sheriff was already concerned.
[01:28:01.928 --> 01:28:05.450]  Okay, can you say where it is or are you not supposed to?
[01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:08.112]  Let me just say in Southwest Virginia.
[01:28:08.112 --> 01:28:09.693]  Southwest Virginia.
[01:28:09.693 --> 01:28:11.694]  I'm going to shut up, start over, tell us what happened.
[01:28:12.233 --> 01:28:20.980]  Well, I just went in and had my article, actually, the printout from the National Guard website.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:25.243]  The guy was very gracious, didn't have an appointment or anything, said, come on back, what's on your mind?
[01:28:25.243 --> 01:28:29.386]  And I handed this to him and I said, have you seen this before?
[01:28:29.386 --> 01:28:34.250]  And he looked at it and he said, no, to be honest with you, I haven't.
[01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:41.396]  He said, I've heard about it, but I didn't know that these things existed or certainly this is new information.
[01:28:42.071 --> 01:28:45.615]  And he said, well, he said, let me hand you something.
[01:28:45.615 --> 01:28:54.023]  So he hands me an article from his nephew who is active duty army and it involves
[01:28:55.042 --> 01:29:01.047]  Uh, these folks having to register all of their privately owned firearms with the federal government.
[01:29:01.047 --> 01:29:02.228]  Oh yeah, that's confirmed.
[01:29:02.228 --> 01:29:07.693]  And every time the feds get caught, they go, oh that was just a local general over Fort Bragg, he was wrong.
[01:29:07.693 --> 01:29:10.255]  But then it did come out, no, this is happening.
[01:29:10.255 --> 01:29:15.920]  They're making the VFW halls even basically register and turn in their old cannons.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.241]  It's really happening.
[01:29:17.241 --> 01:29:21.925]  Well his, apparently his nephew is very up to speed on what's going on.
[01:29:22.541 --> 01:29:27.022]  And he is active duty, and is feeding him a lot of information.
[01:29:27.022 --> 01:29:32.603]  And he just said to me, I am a total, complete believer in the Second Amendment.
[01:29:32.603 --> 01:29:38.104]  I think everybody, unless you're a felon, should be able to own firearms.
[01:29:38.104 --> 01:29:40.205]  And I asked him, well let me ask you something.
[01:29:40.205 --> 01:29:41.065]  Stay there, I want to hear.
[01:29:41.065 --> 01:29:43.846]  Yeah, you ask him what he was going to do if it happens.
[01:29:43.846 --> 01:29:50.027]  If we can get the police and military to just follow the Bill of Rights, the new world order comes to a dead standstill.
[01:29:51.414 --> 01:29:55.346]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.346 --> 01:29:58.035]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.575 --> 01:30:05.779]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:30:05.779 --> 01:30:09.822]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:15.706]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.706 --> 01:30:20.789]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.789 --> 01:30:21.230]  Number three,
[01:30:21.690 --> 01:30:27.992]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:30:27.992 --> 01:30:30.873]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:30:30.873 --> 01:30:35.394]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:35.394 --> 01:30:39.015]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:39.255 --> 01:30:44.979]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:31:00.865 --> 01:31:03.868]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.868 --> 01:31:09.193]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.193 --> 01:31:11.255]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.255 --> 01:31:16.260]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:17.161]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.421 --> 01:31:18.543]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.543 --> 01:31:20.425]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.425 --> 01:31:21.507]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.507 --> 01:31:23.709]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:25.051]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.051 --> 01:31:26.573]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.573 --> 01:31:31.860]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:34.985]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.425 --> 01:31:39.248]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.248 --> 01:31:40.469]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.469 --> 01:31:41.370]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:42.471]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.471 --> 01:31:43.411]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.411 --> 01:31:44.512]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.512 --> 01:31:47.555]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.555 --> 01:31:49.336]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.336 --> 01:31:50.237]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:01.448 --> 01:32:03.610]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:10.756]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on Earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[01:32:10.756 --> 01:32:16.601]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere.
[01:32:16.701 --> 01:32:16.961]  We're good.
[01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:41.455]  Our competition charges $0.10 to $1.25 per seed for these same heirloom varieties.
[01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:49.122]  But you can now have a head of lettuce, a bundle of carrots, a basket of tomatoes, a giant watermelon, and 16 other varieties for about a penny a seed each!
[01:32:49.122 --> 01:32:49.923]  Be prepared!
[01:32:49.923 --> 01:32:55.168]  Buy your heirloom seeds today from SurvivalistSeeds.com and have food insurance for your family forever!

[01:32:57.010 --> 01:32:59.172]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb.
[01:33:10.626 --> 01:33:13.231]  It's impossible to give each caller one minute.
[01:33:13.231 --> 01:33:15.275]  Lady calls in to shot the viral video.
[01:33:16.892 --> 01:33:24.761]  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee talking on the phone while a cancer survivor tries to ask her about ration care, which is in there.
[01:33:24.761 --> 01:33:26.963]  We've gone over the subsections.
[01:33:26.963 --> 01:33:31.788]  Other callers call in with troops doing FEMA camp takeover drills, GPS marking.
[01:33:31.788 --> 01:33:35.653]  Other callers talking to their sheriff that says, yeah, they'll put us in camps.
[01:33:35.653 --> 01:33:37.695]  Another sheriff says he won't take our guns.
[01:33:42.389 --> 01:33:42.589]  I think?
[01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:58.506]  Make no mistake, God is giving us all a chance to see this is real.
[01:33:58.506 --> 01:34:01.870]  With all these congressmen out saying, yeah, we're being told martial law is coming.
[01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:04.272]  I'm getting to that in a few minutes.
[01:34:04.272 --> 01:34:08.777]  With all this happening, there's no more time to live in denial, folks.
[01:34:08.777 --> 01:34:15.684]  We have psychological warfare experts that probe and test and are trying to see if they can sell us on this.
[01:34:16.605 --> 01:34:20.106]  And I just want to tell the military and police and everybody else, this is not a game.
[01:34:20.106 --> 01:34:21.387]  I know I say that a lot.
[01:34:21.387 --> 01:34:25.348]  This is not a game or a stick or a joke on this show.
[01:34:25.348 --> 01:34:32.771]  A lot of you have heard me 10, 12, 13 plus years and you're believers now because you've gone and checked out what I've claimed.
[01:34:32.771 --> 01:34:33.511]  You didn't at first.
[01:34:33.511 --> 01:34:36.572]  You laughed at me 10 years ago but saw so much of it come true.
[01:34:36.572 --> 01:34:43.835]  You've now gone and looked at what I've said and you found out it's worse than I'm telling you because I can't explain to you how diabolical it is.
[01:34:45.952 --> 01:34:50.375]  One story along these lines is so diabolical, I can't believe it.
[01:34:50.375 --> 01:34:57.219]  Even though it's admitted in court documents and they were convicted in France, but they got away with it everywhere else and just had civil penalties.
[01:34:57.219 --> 01:35:14.309]  Bayer Pharmaceutical, this is one of thousands, but I mention it because it's well known, knowingly on purpose put HIV and hepatitis in shots for children in their Factor VIII vaccine.
[01:35:14.309 --> 01:35:14.930]  Factor VIII drug.
[01:35:15.970 --> 01:35:18.811]  And it came, because, and the media said, why'd they do that?
[01:35:18.811 --> 01:35:19.512]  They didn't care.
[01:35:19.512 --> 01:35:23.033]  You know, because it turned out they knew about it for 10 years and kept doing it.
[01:35:23.033 --> 01:35:25.994]  No, folks, they think they're doing good work.
[01:35:25.994 --> 01:35:33.217]  When your kid gets put in a little four-foot coffin and gets lowered down on the ground, they've done a good day's work.
[01:35:33.217 --> 01:35:35.438]  They go home and give each other high-fives.
[01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:36.539]  You understand that?
[01:35:36.539 --> 01:35:39.080]  Now, I don't know how to explain this to you any other way.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.881]  People say I'm a little wild, I go a little crazy.
[01:35:42.881 --> 01:35:45.583]  What do you think it's like dealing with this every day, knowing it's true?
[01:35:45.583 --> 01:35:47.464]  Controlling myself.
[01:35:47.464 --> 01:35:49.925]  Putting up with the government's crap.
[01:35:49.925 --> 01:35:53.587]  Because I know most of the people in government are just on power trips, are ignorant.
[01:35:53.587 --> 01:35:55.448]  Look, it's real, okay?
[01:35:55.448 --> 01:35:57.669]  It's real!
[01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:59.030]  You're under attack too!
[01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:00.791]  Can't you get that through your head?
[01:36:00.791 --> 01:36:05.613]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[01:36:05.613 --> 01:36:08.255]  I want to go to a bunch of your calls and I've got tons of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:36:09.386 --> 01:36:29.287]  John in Virginia, so you're there in southern Virginia, you're talking to your sheriff, he says, yeah, I know about the gun confiscation, I know about the military, you give them the FEMA camp document where they're hiring the troops for the re-education centers and the relocation, and they admit in mainstream news they're getting ready to lock down cities and do, you know, whether it's a drill or not, they're telling them it's going to happen!
[01:36:30.128 --> 01:36:37.053]  That's like if somebody cocks a gun or loads the chamber and puts a gun to your head and says, I'm going to blow your head off.
[01:36:37.053 --> 01:36:38.575]  I don't know if they're really going to do it.
[01:36:38.575 --> 01:36:41.077]  Point is, they're doing it!
[01:36:41.077 --> 01:36:44.359]  I'm tired of this mind game people play saying, I'm saying this is going to happen.
[01:36:44.359 --> 01:36:49.924]  No, they're saying this on ABC News, on CNN, on Fox.
[01:36:49.924 --> 01:36:52.586]  And then they're actually putting the assets in place.
[01:36:52.586 --> 01:36:55.028]  This is not a tabletop exercise.
[01:36:55.028 --> 01:36:56.429]  This is really going on.
[01:36:56.429 --> 01:36:57.069]  So I don't know.
[01:36:58.126 --> 01:37:06.868]  I don't know why they're going around with federal grants, making police stations all harden themselves for terror attack, and even in small towns, and saying the citizens are about to attack you.
[01:37:06.868 --> 01:37:13.370]  What is it they're planning, so horrible, that we're going to have to go out and go up against the government?
[01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:14.950]  I'm asking you that question!
[01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:19.331]  Look, again, I try to be calm about all this, folks.
[01:37:19.331 --> 01:37:22.412]  I don't know how... John, just finish your story.
[01:37:22.412 --> 01:37:22.712]  Go ahead.
[01:37:23.595 --> 01:37:25.877]  Well, I was encouraged, frankly.
[01:37:25.877 --> 01:37:34.504]  I mean, here's a guy that's active-duty military that is informing his uncle what's obviously going on that few of us know about.
[01:37:34.504 --> 01:37:39.508]  And his uncle is very receptive to it, and actually very receptive to the information I gave him.
[01:37:39.508 --> 01:37:53.159]  And I just flat-out asked the question, if it gets to this point where we have federal troops in here that are going to be requiring us to go to FEMA camps or take mandatory
[01:37:53.806 --> 01:37:55.647]  Uh, vaccinations.
[01:37:55.647 --> 01:37:57.509]  What's going to be your position on this?
[01:37:57.509 --> 01:38:00.911]  And he said, I won't allow that.
[01:38:00.911 --> 01:38:03.793]  So I was real encouraged.
[01:38:03.793 --> 01:38:10.758]  Uh, I'm not saying there aren't some real bad folks out there because there are, but I think there's some real good folks out there that just aren't informed.
[01:38:10.758 --> 01:38:12.259]  And we came back up now.
[01:38:12.259 --> 01:38:14.300]  Now is when people are asking questions.
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:15.901]  We got to move forward.
[01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:17.062]  I did go to my pastor.
[01:38:17.062 --> 01:38:23.006]  I think that's another Avenue that we can go to because pastors are just a linchpin in this for so many people.
[01:38:23.987 --> 01:38:29.472]  And I wish I could report to you that the pastor was as receptive to this information as the sheriff was.
[01:38:29.472 --> 01:38:36.117]  The pastors apparently don't want to get real political, so they want to stay on.
[01:38:36.117 --> 01:38:44.984]  Well, you know about the clergy response teams and that even if they aren't under FEMA payment themselves, their denomination is.
[01:38:44.984 --> 01:38:51.569]  Every major denomination, both Catholic and Protestant and all the other groups, are all the major denominations.
[01:38:52.506 --> 01:39:00.628]  Because if you don't, the government comes after them with their 501c3, have signed on to the clergy response team's InfraGard.
[01:39:00.628 --> 01:39:01.909]  You're aware of that, right?
[01:39:01.909 --> 01:39:03.149]  Yeah, yeah, I am.
[01:39:03.149 --> 01:39:04.850]  And I've been looking at this thing now.
[01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:07.611]  I'm over the half-century mark.
[01:39:07.611 --> 01:39:13.992]  I've been looking at this for a good 15 years, and I know you've been looking at it for a good number of years.
[01:39:13.992 --> 01:39:16.353]  And frankly, I'm encouraged.
[01:39:16.353 --> 01:39:22.095]  I'm seeing an awakening right now that even two years ago, if you'd started telling people this stuff,
[01:39:22.799 --> 01:39:25.601]  They would have thought you were nuts.
[01:39:25.601 --> 01:39:27.042]  Now they're not saying that.
[01:39:27.042 --> 01:39:30.064]  Actually, I'm seeing people say, get me information.
[01:39:30.064 --> 01:39:31.365]  Show me what you know.
[01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:32.225]  You know, give me this.
[01:39:32.225 --> 01:39:32.626]  I agree.
[01:39:32.626 --> 01:39:33.586]  I agree.
[01:39:33.586 --> 01:39:35.087]  John, God bless you.
[01:39:35.087 --> 01:39:36.108]  One more point.
[01:39:36.108 --> 01:39:36.749]  Go ahead.
[01:39:36.749 --> 01:39:45.715]  We got a big tea party and I don't know if you've mentioned this or not, but on September the 12th, there is a nationwide tea party on the mall in Washington, D.C.
[01:39:45.715 --> 01:39:47.576]  They're hoping to get a million
[01:39:48.271 --> 01:39:55.034]  Americans up there to show these people that we are united, we understand what's going on, and we're tired of it.
[01:39:55.034 --> 01:40:03.197]  So if all of your listeners could just get in touch with the local Tea Parties and their group, they're all going to have benefits.
[01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:03.537]  I hear you.
[01:40:03.537 --> 01:40:04.837]  I gotta get to the other callers.
[01:40:04.837 --> 01:40:10.419]  See, the issue is the callers are all so great, and then if I don't cut a caller off, I'll never get to the next caller, so it becomes a cash-22.
[01:40:10.419 --> 01:40:14.141]  But just on the Tea Party issue, I know Lou Dobbs is good.
[01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:15.261]  I've talked to him off-air.
[01:40:15.261 --> 01:40:16.362]  I know people that work with him.
[01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:24.580]  He has a contract, before he got all political five years ago, and it's running out, I believe, next year, where he can do whatever he wants.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:29.022]  And they don't want to pay out his contract, because it's big.
[01:40:29.022 --> 01:40:34.843]  And he knows all about the New World Order, he's from Texas, he's a good guy.
[01:40:34.843 --> 01:40:36.304]  Lou Dobbs is for real.
[01:40:36.304 --> 01:40:43.306]  Now, Beck, I've seen him stab us in the back over and over again, but then he'll tell the truth, and then
[01:40:44.986 --> 01:40:45.828]  Stab us in the back.
[01:40:45.828 --> 01:40:47.672]  Tell the truth, stab us in the back.
[01:40:47.672 --> 01:40:51.842]  And to me, that's even worse than just being pure evil all the time.
[01:40:51.842 --> 01:40:54.809]  I just, I can't stand somebody who's lukewarm.
[01:40:56.978 --> 01:40:59.559]  When I was a kid in Sunday school, I didn't understand what that meant.
[01:40:59.559 --> 01:41:05.301]  Now that I know a little bit more about the world and a little bit of wisdom, now I understand how bad lukewarm people are.
[01:41:05.301 --> 01:41:07.022]  It's the scum of the earth.
[01:41:07.022 --> 01:41:18.546]  But I will tell you that they are legitimately boycotting him and MSNBC is calling out his sponsors and they're trying to kick him off the air because
[01:41:20.287 --> 01:41:33.262]  There is probably a fissure in the New World Order, well I know there is, and there is a fight going on, a power struggle, and for some reason they don't like Beck.
[01:41:33.262 --> 01:41:37.267]  This is not just a ruse or a fake attack to make people come to his aid.
[01:41:37.267 --> 01:41:39.410]  This is an attack to shut down free speech everywhere.
[01:41:40.979 --> 01:41:43.600]  And so we have to defend his right to the First Amendment.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:52.524]  Just like Michael Savage, I don't agree with him on some things, I agree with him on a lot, but I've come to his aid whenever, you know, he is under attack.
[01:41:52.524 --> 01:41:58.126]  Because, just like I came to Democrats' aid, who I don't agree with.
[01:41:58.126 --> 01:42:02.068]  Because, you know, I don't agree with people that put crucifix in urine.
[01:42:02.068 --> 01:42:08.010]  But folks, the media uses those images to set the precedent to take all our speech.
[01:42:08.010 --> 01:42:09.671]  That's the thing about speech.
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:17.741]  And if somebody is lying about you or doing something really bad to you, you're forced to litigate against them.
[01:42:17.741 --> 01:42:31.024]  But you can't have the government... Now, I'm still busy making films and things, too, that aren't... You have to stand up for yourself.
[01:42:31.024 --> 01:42:37.565]  But... And I try to take the high road with things that are said about me that aren't true.
[01:42:37.565 --> 01:42:38.065]  But, uh...
[01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:44.832]  It's just crazy how they try to attack the First Amendment.
[01:42:44.832 --> 01:42:50.576]  Okay, I want to go to Doug, Tim, Dana, Richard, Thomas, and others here in just a moment.
[01:42:50.576 --> 01:42:56.859]  Coming up, Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[01:42:56.859 --> 01:43:01.442]  HIV vaccines they now want to push on school kids here in the U.S.
[01:43:01.442 --> 01:43:03.944]  There's nothing they won't do to us, folks.
[01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:07.586]  No one will accept even trials anywhere in the world.
[01:43:07.586 --> 01:43:10.388]  But we are known as such idiots by the globalists that
[01:43:11.607 --> 01:43:19.111]  I mean, well, we're going to cover it coming up.
[01:43:19.111 --> 01:43:26.814]  But I did want to get Ted Anderson on for five minutes right now because you've heard him do gold and silver offers in the past here.
[01:43:26.814 --> 01:43:28.895]  He's the owner of Genesis Communications.
[01:43:28.895 --> 01:43:32.597]  He's where I buy my gold and silver because, frankly, I can't find a better deal.
[01:43:32.597 --> 01:43:35.259]  I've shopped around.
[01:43:35.259 --> 01:43:39.741]  I bought a little silver here and there, you know, at street level that I hadn't gotten from Ted.
[01:43:41.021 --> 01:43:44.564]  But Ted buys when it's low and then sells it at the low price when it's high.
[01:43:44.564 --> 01:43:49.369]  That's his big secret and why he's become so successful in the last 30 years.
[01:43:49.369 --> 01:43:54.513]  In the last 12 years setting up Genesis.
[01:43:54.513 --> 01:44:01.900]  So... And all the other times, I'll get up on there and I'll say, this is the last time he's offering this.
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:03.502]  And then it is the last time.
[01:44:03.502 --> 01:44:04.643]  You know, that super special deal.
[01:44:05.717 --> 01:44:05.897]  I think?
[01:44:19.494 --> 01:44:24.075]  That he was able to keep offering and offering and offering and offering it, but now the market's gone crazy.
[01:44:24.075 --> 01:44:26.816]  It's up $10 a day, $5 yesterday.
[01:44:26.816 --> 01:44:31.818]  It's up over $65, almost $70 from when he bought gold.
[01:44:31.818 --> 01:44:34.779]  So he bought gold when it was almost $70 lower.
[01:44:34.779 --> 01:44:37.440]  I don't know, $905 to $910, $911 range.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:38.480]  He bought them at different buys.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:38.800]  Some at $93, $95, $97, $910, $911.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:40.360]  I've seen the purchase orders he sent them to me.
[01:44:49.358 --> 01:45:00.546]  Then, gold's up at $970-something, and he's selling it to you, with it factored in the market, at the $905, $9010, $911 number.
[01:45:00.546 --> 01:45:03.748]  Silver is way, way up, several dollars.
[01:45:03.748 --> 01:45:09.211]  He's still selling it at the level when it was a few bucks cheaper per ounce, though Lakotas did just go up.
[01:45:09.211 --> 01:45:10.973]  So, one of the things we said was about to go up, it did.
[01:45:11.813 --> 01:45:13.014]  I see the purchase orders.
[01:45:13.014 --> 01:45:15.396]  Ted, what you ought to do is what stores do.
[01:45:15.396 --> 01:45:17.918]  You ought to show people your actual invoice.
[01:45:17.918 --> 01:45:21.921]  Because I get these, or if you give me permission, I'll dig it out of the email and show people.
[01:45:21.921 --> 01:45:25.304]  On one of these gold francs, he's making $4 on it.
[01:45:25.304 --> 01:45:28.927]  On a silver coin, he might be making 50, 60 cents on it.
[01:45:28.927 --> 01:45:30.428]  This is a lost leader for Ted.
[01:45:32.236 --> 01:45:38.540]  And so he's selling you gold and silver at below what the market is with almost no markup.
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.281]  Because he wants your business.
[01:45:40.281 --> 01:45:44.764]  And so that said, what is gold right now, Ted?
[01:45:44.764 --> 01:45:49.127]  Well, the high today on gold is $9.6150.
[01:45:49.127 --> 01:45:51.068]  When I printed it off, we were looking at about $9.56.
[01:45:51.068 --> 01:45:52.049]  It's fluctuating right now.
[01:45:55.711 --> 01:46:01.654]  You know, you're trying to explain why would I buy something low and still keep the low price even though it's a market.
[01:46:01.654 --> 01:46:04.455]  Yeah, because I saw a 9.60, so I guess it's going all over the map then.
[01:46:04.455 --> 01:46:06.316]  Yeah, 9.61.50 today.
[01:46:06.316 --> 01:46:08.478]  Of course, it's very strong.
[01:46:08.478 --> 01:46:10.298]  Dollars dropping.
[01:46:10.298 --> 01:46:13.180]  To me, it's like a no-brain situation to me.
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:16.041]  I'm watching what's going on in Washington, D.C.
[01:46:17.222 --> 01:46:24.470]  You know, the fundamentals, I can put the pieces together and go, OK, if gold comes down in price, chances are it'll come back up again.
[01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:36.323]  And I've been making bets like this for about the last two years, where I'm able to wait till the market drops and figure that it's not going to drop further, it'll start rising again.
[01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:38.866]  We've been in a bull market in gold since, well, what?
[01:46:40.867 --> 01:46:45.329]  The year 1996 I think was the lowest that it was at, 256.
[01:46:45.329 --> 01:46:49.491]  It's been climbing ever since then.
[01:46:49.491 --> 01:46:54.113]  And so right now I watch the market dip and I know it's the time to buy.
[01:46:54.113 --> 01:47:02.237]  I mean it could, quite literally, if I buy it at $9.10, it could go down to $8.50 and I could be sitting on inventory that's too high in price.
[01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:12.564]  It's almost like, I gotta tell you, Alex, I haven't lost, not even once yet, in the last two years, have I lost because I bought on the dip?
[01:47:12.564 --> 01:47:19.929]  Because every time it comes back up again, and the interesting thing is, the customers stop buying when the market is down, because they think that it's all over.
[01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:25.973]  And then all of a sudden it comes raging back up again like it has now, and it gets exciting again, people buy it again.
[01:47:25.973 --> 01:47:32.638]  It's crazy how that works, but what I prefer to do is I prefer to get people into gold and silver at a lower price.
[01:47:32.638 --> 01:47:37.922]  It's also to my advantage to be more competitively priced than my competition.
[01:47:37.922 --> 01:47:39.403]  I mean, you take that Lakota coin.
[01:47:39.403 --> 01:47:43.226]  I told everybody that the thing was going to be going over $20 an ounce.
[01:47:43.226 --> 01:47:49.051]  Well, I just had to order my last 5,000 coins, and that particular group came in,
[01:47:50.103 --> 01:47:52.584]  And now they're at $20.86 apiece.
[01:47:52.584 --> 01:47:54.085]  We were offering them at $19.96.
[01:47:54.085 --> 01:48:06.130]  I'm going to tell people now, the Walking Liberty half that I was offering for $8.69 when Silver was at $9.10 on your show, is still currently right now at $8.69.
[01:48:06.130 --> 01:48:08.011]  Why is it $8.69?
[01:48:08.011 --> 01:48:08.311]  Why?
[01:48:08.311 --> 01:48:11.112]  Because I was able to get myself about 50 bags of those.
[01:48:11.112 --> 01:48:18.155]  50 bags of Walking Liberty halves, and one bag that is $1,000 face value, in case you don't understand what that means.
[01:48:19.075 --> 01:48:24.920]  1,000 face value means 2,050 cent pieces, or walking liberty halves in this case.
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:33.287]  So I'm able to do something at a price that is relative to where spot was when silver was down there at about $11 an ounce.
[01:48:33.287 --> 01:48:34.028]  Absolutely.
[01:48:34.028 --> 01:48:36.330]  People need to take advantage of this right now, Ted.
[01:48:36.330 --> 01:48:37.811]  The number to call is 1-800-686-2237.
[01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:38.492]  Here's that number, 800.
[01:48:43.936 --> 01:48:45.297]  686-2237.
[01:48:45.297 --> 01:48:46.498]  No pressure, no nothing.
[01:48:46.498 --> 01:48:55.204]  Call up, say you want the Alex Jones Special, the silver half dollars, the Lakota rounds, other silver dollars they've got, depending on the deal you want.
[01:48:55.204 --> 01:49:01.989]  They've got the really low prices on the European francs, the Swiss and French, the British sovereign, the prized coin.
[01:49:01.989 --> 01:49:03.630]  This is an insanely good deal.
[01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:03.670]  800-686-2237.
[01:49:07.933 --> 01:49:10.416]  The globalists all hoard gold and silver.
[01:49:10.416 --> 01:49:12.858]  It's clear they're going to run commodities up again.
[01:49:12.858 --> 01:49:15.440]  It's clear hyperinflation's coming up.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:18.503]  It is insane to stay only in paper.
[01:49:18.503 --> 01:49:24.189]  Anybody who's got the assets, I would recommend, I know myself, and mainly, I have no stocks, no bonds.
[01:49:24.189 --> 01:49:29.314]  It's all silver and gold, and that's limited, because I've spent everything on the business and the operation, but the point is, 800-686-2237.
[01:49:33.598 --> 01:49:36.539]  Yeah, Alex, I mean, you're talking about the globalists.
[01:49:36.539 --> 01:49:43.583]  The global bankers right now, as a policy, are publishing the fact that they're no longer selling the gold that they once were.
[01:49:43.583 --> 01:49:47.825]  They're dropping those numbers that they're willing to sell.
[01:49:47.825 --> 01:49:49.626]  They're getting back into gold right now.
[01:49:49.626 --> 01:49:51.647]  They're not pushing themselves away.
[01:49:51.647 --> 01:49:55.989]  They themselves are protecting themselves from each other's currencies.
[01:49:55.989 --> 01:50:01.792]  The United States dollar, people know it, the United States dollar is on a fast slide downhill.
[01:50:02.659 --> 01:50:06.144]  You know, there is no reason in the world why the dollar is going to stay strong.
[01:50:06.144 --> 01:50:12.214]  It was living the legacy of being the world reserve currency because it was exchangeable for gold up through 1970.
[01:50:12.214 --> 01:50:14.077]  Yeah, now they're having these U.S.
[01:50:14.077 --> 01:50:17.422]  Treasury auctions in the Chinese and people are balking for the first time.
[01:50:17.422 --> 01:50:17.602]  Look.
[01:50:18.203 --> 01:50:20.365]  I don't know what's going to happen, but it doesn't look pretty.
[01:50:20.365 --> 01:50:22.506]  Insurance is gold and silver.
[01:50:22.506 --> 01:50:24.188]  This is the safest bet out there.
[01:50:24.188 --> 01:50:24.468]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:24.468 --> 01:50:28.671]  And it's not just that gold and silver is the best bet.
[01:50:28.671 --> 01:50:30.853]  This is the best deal in the best bet.
[01:50:30.853 --> 01:50:32.374]  So the best of the best of the best.
[01:50:32.374 --> 01:50:33.935]  The cut above the cut.
[01:50:33.935 --> 01:50:34.756]  This is it.
[01:50:34.756 --> 01:50:35.056]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:35.056 --> 01:50:39.439]  Ted, you keep holding this, but you told me you are running out.
[01:50:39.439 --> 01:50:41.181]  You ran out of Lakotas at that price.
[01:50:41.181 --> 01:50:42.542]  How long can you hold this?
[01:50:42.542 --> 01:50:44.423]  Well, that is the magical question.
[01:50:44.423 --> 01:50:46.365]  How many people are going to buy my inventory?
[01:50:46.365 --> 01:50:46.745]  We'll see.
[01:50:47.566 --> 01:50:50.649]  Hopefully it can go through this weekend, but it might have to end tomorrow.
[01:50:50.649 --> 01:50:52.511]  Alright, they're there folks.
[01:50:52.511 --> 01:50:53.752]  Call up to midnight tonight.
[01:50:53.752 --> 01:50:57.556]  Alright, the Southern Poverty Law Center has on their website that I need to be killed.
[01:50:57.556 --> 01:50:58.397]  They're now getting ready.
[01:51:01.385 --> 01:51:03.907]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[01:51:03.907 --> 01:51:06.248]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[01:51:06.248 --> 01:51:08.550]  The price of food continues to rise.
[01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:10.471]  And the economy continues to falter.
[01:51:10.471 --> 01:51:12.773]  You know that you need to prepare.
[01:51:12.773 --> 01:51:16.576]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[01:51:16.576 --> 01:51:19.638]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[01:51:20.198 --> 01:51:21.218]  We're good to go.
[01:51:37.964 --> 01:51:42.246]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[01:52:10.612 --> 01:52:11.393]  We're good to go!
[01:52:32.691 --> 01:52:33.071]  We're good to go.
[01:53:01.297 --> 01:53:02.718]  It is a big idea.
[01:53:02.718 --> 01:53:05.540]  A New World Order.
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:09.662]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:53:09.662 --> 01:53:13.264]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:53:13.264 --> 01:53:16.046]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:53:16.046 --> 01:53:19.228]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:53:19.228 --> 01:53:26.552]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:53:29.568 --> 01:53:35.012]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:53:35.012 --> 01:53:38.894]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:53:38.894 --> 01:53:41.456]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:53:41.456 --> 01:53:42.617]  Most people have no idea.
[01:53:42.617 --> 01:53:43.397]  They're not after money.
[01:53:43.397 --> 01:53:44.698]  They have all the money they need.
[01:53:44.698 --> 01:53:45.659]  They're after power.
[01:53:45.659 --> 01:53:46.820]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:54:11.070 --> 01:54:16.611]  The Southern Poverty Law Center is an anti-democratic pro-police state group.
[01:54:16.611 --> 01:54:19.372]  They say the Bilderberg Group doesn't want world government on their own minutes.
[01:54:19.372 --> 01:54:21.172]  It meant they do.
[01:54:21.172 --> 01:54:24.233]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center put me in their big report saying that
[01:54:26.306 --> 01:54:29.007]  I'm calling for a shooting war with the government.
[01:54:29.007 --> 01:54:36.570]  And as a quote, they used a comment of the millions of comments, and it is millions, on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:36.570 --> 01:54:41.692]  So by their extension, they are calling for my death.
[01:54:41.692 --> 01:54:46.234]  Because these are moderated comments, they left this up on their website.
[01:54:46.234 --> 01:54:47.915]  This is about extremism, folks.
[01:54:47.915 --> 01:54:52.757]  White supremacists, conspiracy mongers, ilk, like Alex Jones, religious radicals.
[01:54:53.933 --> 01:54:54.713]  We're good to go.
[01:55:13.015 --> 01:55:16.636]  And the innocent potential victims around the world, all the good.
[01:55:16.636 --> 01:55:18.997]  So, see, legitimizing our death.
[01:55:18.997 --> 01:55:20.717]  Sadly, Blavatsky is only one of them.
[01:55:20.717 --> 01:55:23.118]  I expect to see more violence.
[01:55:23.118 --> 01:55:25.519]  Well, yeah, because you're calling to kill people.
[01:55:25.519 --> 01:55:27.099]  So, that's the story.
[01:55:27.099 --> 01:55:30.541]  They've got it on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:55:30.541 --> 01:55:36.662]  Southern Poverty Law Center supporter execute Alex Jones for his political beliefs.
[01:55:36.662 --> 01:55:40.364]  And these are the inheritors of the Stalin purges.
[01:55:40.364 --> 01:55:41.264]  They do mean business.
[01:55:43.158 --> 01:55:44.959]  And they really do!
[01:55:44.959 --> 01:55:47.419]  We really are being overrun by parasite scum.
[01:55:47.419 --> 01:55:49.160]  Well, they're bank robbers.
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:53.561]  That's what these people are.
[01:55:53.561 --> 01:55:57.762]  Southern Poverty Law Center was funding white supremacist compounds running bank robberies.
[01:55:57.762 --> 01:56:02.404]  They're just a crew of pirates who speak to your
[01:56:03.988 --> 01:56:08.449]  Your hatred of racism, your humanity, and get you to give them money.
[01:56:08.449 --> 01:56:09.329]  It's all about control.
[01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:14.010]  They're just gangsters playing PSYOP games with your mind.
[01:56:14.010 --> 01:56:18.111]  I've had enough of the Southern Poverty Law Center and Morris Sleaze.
[01:56:18.111 --> 01:56:19.691]  Doug in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:56:19.691 --> 01:56:20.351]  Go ahead, Doug.
[01:56:20.351 --> 01:56:24.692]  Go ahead, Doug.
[01:56:24.692 --> 01:56:28.913]  I wanted to talk to you about if you knew anything about what's going on in Akwesasne.
[01:56:29.722 --> 01:56:32.263]  Up now on the border of Canada and the United States.
[01:56:32.263 --> 01:56:32.863]  No, tell me.
[01:56:32.863 --> 01:56:35.605]  I mean, is that one where they're killing the natives?
[01:56:35.605 --> 01:56:36.805]  Is it so liberal and loving?
[01:56:36.805 --> 01:56:38.146]  What's going on?
[01:56:38.146 --> 01:56:39.667]  Well, Akwesasne lies.
[01:56:39.667 --> 01:56:42.848]  It's straddling the border.
[01:56:42.848 --> 01:56:48.310]  You have Ontario, Quebec, and New York State pretending they have some type of jurisdiction.
[01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:49.031]  None of them do.
[01:56:49.031 --> 01:56:51.212]  But I guess on June 1st,
[01:56:52.219 --> 01:56:58.122]  The Canadian Border Service, now the worst guys in there are all out there at the Cornwall Crossing.
[01:56:58.122 --> 01:57:01.603]  They put their building right on our island, right on our territory.
[01:57:01.603 --> 01:57:05.425]  So they said they wanted 9mm handguns there.
[01:57:05.425 --> 01:57:10.087]  And the only place in Canada where the border guys would have these things.
[01:57:10.087 --> 01:57:14.289]  And so our people said, no, we don't want any guns in Akwesasne.
[01:57:14.289 --> 01:57:16.950]  And so they just went on strike and just ran away.
[01:57:17.859 --> 01:57:30.148]  Anyways, um, if you could just, um, on, on YouTube, uh, Google rekindle, or search rekindling the fires, a really good, uh, video from inside what's really going on there, you know?
[01:57:30.148 --> 01:57:37.353]  And, uh, I think that really needs to, um, you know, people need to know about this, because the globalists have had us surrounded since June 1st.
[01:57:37.353 --> 01:57:40.375]  Not one word in mainstream media about it, ever.
[01:57:40.375 --> 01:57:41.916]  Except today, I heard that
[01:57:42.939 --> 01:57:48.123]  The Julian Fantino, the criminal of the Ontario Provincial Police.
[01:57:48.123 --> 01:57:52.326]  He's announcing that they're going to crack down on the smuggling at Akwesasne.
[01:57:52.326 --> 01:57:53.546]  Okay, cut.
[01:57:53.546 --> 01:57:54.967]  Okay, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:57:54.967 --> 01:57:55.848]  We'll check it out, Doug.
[01:57:55.848 --> 01:57:56.529]  Thank you.
[01:57:56.529 --> 01:57:57.930]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:57:57.930 --> 01:57:58.370]  Go ahead.
[01:57:58.370 --> 01:58:00.331]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:00.331 --> 01:58:07.256]  Today, I sent Aaron and Mike at, uh, I think it's tipsandinfowars.com.
[01:58:07.256 --> 01:58:07.896]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:58:07.896 --> 01:58:08.477]  What'd you send?
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:09.521]  Oh, the image.
[01:58:09.521 --> 01:58:19.648]  I sent them... I took the Obama fascism thing, and I sported them up with some buck teeth, and I recreated a mad magazine cover.
[01:58:19.648 --> 01:58:26.413]  And I've been taking handfuls of these, going into bookstores, magazine racks, stuff like that, and slapping them all up in front of the Time, Newsweek, U.S.
[01:58:26.413 --> 01:58:28.895]  News and World Report.
[01:58:28.895 --> 01:58:30.516]  And it looks like a real magazine cover.
[01:58:30.516 --> 01:58:32.918]  Feel free to put it on the website and have people use it.
[01:58:33.504 --> 01:58:37.811]  Interesting, you know, though it's illegal to criticize the president.
[01:58:37.811 --> 01:58:43.040]  That's un-American.
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:45.544]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.544 --> 01:58:47.868]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.558 --> 01:58:54.782]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.782 --> 01:58:56.803]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.803 --> 01:59:05.331]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.331 --> 01:59:10.875]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.875 --> 01:59:12.497]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.717 --> 01:59:19.242]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.242 --> 01:59:30.290]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:30.750]  That's right.
[01:59:31.050 --> 01:59:33.612]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.612 --> 01:59:37.794]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:59:37.794 --> 01:59:40.956]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[01:59:53.683 --> 01:59:56.064]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.064 --> 01:59:58.886]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.262 --> 02:00:06.564]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.564 --> 02:00:08.327]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.327 --> 02:00:10.089]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.089 --> 02:00:11.671]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:13.234]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.234 --> 02:00:17.420]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:21.466]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.602 --> 02:00:31.285]  We are continuing with a phone blitz, taking lots of your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:31.285 --> 02:00:37.008]  Wayne Madsen with big breaking news joins us coming up in the fourth hour today.
[02:00:37.008 --> 02:00:39.529]  We've now reached the halfway point in the transmission.
[02:00:39.529 --> 02:00:43.831]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv at the start of the next segment.
[02:00:43.831 --> 02:00:50.495]  For PrisonPlanet.tv members, the radio show turns into a living color television news transmission as well.
[02:00:51.235 --> 02:00:56.259]  So coming up, we're going to detail the news after I continue taking calls.
[02:00:56.259 --> 02:00:58.521]  Dana in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:00:58.521 --> 02:01:15.976]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to kind of skip through what has gone on since 2006 and maybe help some new listeners or people to reconfirm and understand how we got where we are as a government legislature.
[02:01:15.976 --> 02:01:17.517]  If you remember back in February of 2006,
[02:01:19.437 --> 02:01:33.506]  Dick Cheney's company, Halliburton, for Kellogg, Brown, Root, KBR, got a $385 million contract to build military detention and retainment centers in this country.
[02:01:33.506 --> 02:01:40.470]  And they're quoted as saying, an emergency influx of immigrants should support the rapid development of new programs.
[02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:45.233]  Now, put that with this new health program uprising that's going on and be testament of that.
[02:01:45.734 --> 02:02:11.620]  Then you move from there, just kind of jumping ahead a little bit, but you move from there to House Bill 645 that was proposed in the Senate this year, or the House Representatives, February the 2nd, where it is asking for detention military camps to come into being for civilians on military installations, and expanding, as you said earlier, Bush's
[02:02:13.916 --> 02:02:22.942]  2007 bill for broad presidential enforcement, which David's requesting that that even be broader for Obama.
[02:02:22.942 --> 02:02:27.285]  Now... Yeah, now they've got bills saying they're going to put everybody in the camps for their own good.
[02:02:27.285 --> 02:02:38.112]  Now they have the internment camp programs asking for the National Guard people to join the Guard, to run the domestic relocation, internment camps, even using that word.
[02:02:38.112 --> 02:02:41.654]  No, it's, it's... But Glenn Beck is telling his audience it's not happening.
[02:02:42.569 --> 02:02:44.830]  There's some more.
[02:02:44.830 --> 02:03:05.035]  The exterminism that Homeland Security has set out recently, it's for right-wing extremists who pose a danger, but it's also the Department of Defense is describing protesters, think about people at these city town hall meetings, as quote-unquote low-level terrorists.
[02:03:05.035 --> 02:03:11.717]  Now if you go to GoArmy.com and just type in a search there for National Guard jobs,
[02:03:12.190 --> 02:03:17.416]  It will take you to the description of what they're calling and setting out to harness.
[02:03:17.416 --> 02:03:19.638]  No, ma'am, ma'am, you're right.
[02:03:19.638 --> 02:03:33.252]  It's an absolutely clear, congruent, stated public fact that the Homeland Security and NORTHCOM and the FEMA camps are for gun owners, landowners, conservatives, Animal ID, Premises ID to shut down the farms and ranches.
[02:03:34.393 --> 02:03:44.620]  The open eugenicists, bioethics boards, Wall Street Journal years ago admitted they do have death boards, they do decide to kill people, they do decide to withdraw food and water from people.
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:46.001]  It's all real.
[02:03:46.001 --> 02:03:47.062]  It's all happening.
[02:03:47.062 --> 02:03:51.985]  We have our own Stalin taking over, but Obama is just their puppet.
[02:03:51.985 --> 02:03:55.007]  This isn't a system where you have a real Stalin or a Mao.
[02:03:55.007 --> 02:03:59.370]  This is a system where they have front men who carry out the same policies for the offshore banks.
[02:03:59.950 --> 02:04:03.771]  And yes, it is really happening here.
[02:04:03.771 --> 02:04:11.993]  And you've laid it all out in a congruent fashion, and that's why I got so mad at Glenn Beck when he said six months ago none of it was real.
[02:04:11.993 --> 02:04:24.496]  I have been doing a lot of study on this flu epidemic, this slime stuff, compared to 1918 when the first time it came around during World War I. I'll owe you money, a million dollars, they're going to take Obama out.
[02:04:24.496 --> 02:04:26.376]  And they're going to use the slime flu to do it.
[02:04:26.826 --> 02:04:29.388]  Because they don't want him in there.
[02:04:29.388 --> 02:04:33.731]  They got him in there to finish up what Bush started during eight years.
[02:04:33.731 --> 02:04:38.976]  He's doing all the disruption and everything he can do to our economy, to our families, to our workers.
[02:04:38.976 --> 02:04:41.377]  And they'll blame it on him and politically destroy him or something?
[02:04:41.377 --> 02:04:41.998]  Right.
[02:04:41.998 --> 02:04:44.980]  And they cannot assassinate him if it did J.F.K.
[02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:45.601]  and other people.
[02:04:45.601 --> 02:04:50.985]  Well, ma'am, why don't you write up your editorial idea and send it to writers at InfoWars.com.
[02:04:50.985 --> 02:04:52.286]  Thanks for calling.

[02:04:53.267 --> 02:04:54.628]  Interesting points.

[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:05.864]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:06:05.864 --> 02:06:09.887]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.887 --> 02:06:15.471]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.791 --> 02:06:16.432]  It's true.
[02:06:16.432 --> 02:06:21.776]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.776 --> 02:06:28.061]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:06:28.061 --> 02:06:30.963]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:06:30.963 --> 02:06:34.326]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:35.487 --> 02:06:39.329]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:39.329 --> 02:06:45.073]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:06:45.073 --> 02:06:49.776]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:00.305 --> 02:07:01.686]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:07:01.686 --> 02:07:03.668]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:07:03.668 --> 02:07:04.649]  Well, you should.
[02:07:04.649 --> 02:07:09.153]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:07:09.153 --> 02:07:09.953]  That's right.
[02:07:09.953 --> 02:07:18.621]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.

[02:07:21.323 --> 02:07:27.308]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:07:27.308 --> 02:07:34.193]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:07:34.193 --> 02:07:39.717]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:04.801]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.801 --> 02:08:07.783]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:07.783 --> 02:08:20.169]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we have one hour and fifty-two minutes left in transmission.
[02:08:20.169 --> 02:08:26.852]  We are now simulcasting the remainder of this radio show in living color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:26.852 --> 02:08:27.393]  Here it is!
[02:08:28.598 --> 02:08:32.360]  This is the classic Obama socialism shirt.
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:35.741]  And on the back, this one just says InfoWars.com.
[02:08:35.741 --> 02:08:39.562]  We have handsome black shirts with this image, really stands out.
[02:08:39.562 --> 02:08:43.364]  I'm going to wear one of those tomorrow or next week on air.
[02:08:43.364 --> 02:08:48.506]  We have it with Obama fascist, ObamaInfoWars.com, Obama New World Order.
[02:08:48.506 --> 02:08:51.167]  On the back, we have different variants, eight different shirts.
[02:08:51.167 --> 02:08:56.009]  Wake up before it's too late, end the feds, stop the criminal.
[02:08:56.009 --> 02:08:57.690]  You want to meet like-minded people.
[02:09:00.359 --> 02:09:02.620]  You want to get the word out.
[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:08.121]  You want to get past the political correctness, because they're on the news saying this is now a hate crime.
[02:09:08.121 --> 02:09:13.443]  And if we give in to that and say, okay, it's a hate crime, I'm not allowed to show him in a bad light, then you've given in.
[02:09:13.443 --> 02:09:17.004]  It's the media and the government creating racism, invoking racism.
[02:09:19.653 --> 02:09:39.931]  And they're doing it cold-bloodedly as a political tool, saying, be politically correct, don't criticize Obama on anti-gun bills, on open borders, on socialized government medical care, takeover, really his eugenics, don't criticize him on cap-and-trade taxes, don't criticize him on abortion, nothing!
[02:09:39.931 --> 02:09:41.733]  Or you hate black people.
[02:09:42.293 --> 02:09:47.636]  And they've now said on MSNBC and CNN, socialism is now the n-word.
[02:09:47.636 --> 02:09:48.176]  It's a code.
[02:09:48.176 --> 02:09:50.497]  I mean, who would ever think of that?
[02:09:50.497 --> 02:09:52.358]  Now they know that's ridiculous.
[02:09:52.358 --> 02:09:54.519]  It is a chilling effect.
[02:09:54.519 --> 02:09:58.581]  So I just want the listeners, I want the viewers out there to stand up.
[02:09:58.581 --> 02:10:03.363]  You can print off the free flyers, put them up in public commons where other posters and things are posted.
[02:10:03.363 --> 02:10:11.187]  You know, I said this last week and I said this on Sunday and I said this in the rules of the contest, that, because I don't want you to get in trouble.
[02:10:12.524 --> 02:10:15.390]  You're doing it on your own, so I don't have any liability.
[02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:16.292]  But I don't want you to get in trouble.
[02:10:16.292 --> 02:10:19.017]  Don't stick it on federal buildings or mailboxes.
[02:10:22.515 --> 02:10:32.524]  Put it under windshields, put it in the Commons area, wherever you see other posters up, or polls, where everybody else puts posters up, it's selective enforcement and discrimination and they come after you.
[02:10:32.524 --> 02:10:34.246]  But I now have Florida newscast.
[02:10:34.246 --> 02:10:43.394]  I mean, I could have made the whole show today about myself, and I probably should, because, you know, we don't want them to try to demonize us nationally as they're doing.
[02:10:43.394 --> 02:10:46.457]  And later, I'll get into that later in the hour, but I want to go to calls right now.
[02:10:48.516 --> 02:10:54.018]  They are saying that we're not allowed to post our posters anywhere and that it's a hate crime.
[02:10:54.018 --> 02:11:03.922]  But we found Obama in 2008 in the Washington Post and we have a copy of his letter saying put the Obama posters up on stop signs.
[02:11:03.922 --> 02:11:05.022]  We never said that.
[02:11:05.022 --> 02:11:12.265]  But see, he can say do that and he's good, but then we can't even say put this up on a light pole.
[02:11:13.257 --> 02:11:16.799]  And we've got stories out of Tennessee, and stories out of California.
[02:11:16.799 --> 02:11:18.640]  We have them up on Infowars.com.
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:21.082]  There's so many I can hardly even cover them all.
[02:11:21.082 --> 02:11:26.585]  Where they got the highway patrol going, it's dangerous to put these on a light pole.
[02:11:26.585 --> 02:11:28.966]  This could distract somebody and cause a wreck.
[02:11:28.966 --> 02:11:38.031]  So it's okay to have the lost dog, or the school event, or the police barbecue, or garage sales up on the pole.
[02:11:38.031 --> 02:11:42.294]  You just don't put a picture of God, that is Obama, up on there.
[02:11:43.325 --> 02:11:47.533]  The good news is I'm looking at TV stations all over the country and newspapers all over the country.
[02:11:47.533 --> 02:11:49.076]  You can just type Obama Joker.
[02:11:50.014 --> 02:12:07.968]  Go to Google News or StartPage.com and click on the News Search and you'll just see scores of articles and stories and where they're going, it's horrible, Alex Jones needs to be arrested, this is so un-American, it's disrespectful, it's illegal to talk about our president.
[02:12:07.968 --> 02:12:09.589]  And then the comments, are you crazy?
[02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:11.010]  There's nothing more American.
[02:12:11.010 --> 02:12:13.812]  It was okay to show Bush as the Joker or as a vampire.
[02:12:13.812 --> 02:12:16.594]  I saw these Bushes a monkey put up everywhere.
[02:12:16.594 --> 02:12:18.576]  I saw Bush as a vampire put up everywhere.
[02:12:19.983 --> 02:12:22.425]  And that was good, because Bush was a New World Order puppet.
[02:12:22.425 --> 02:12:28.089]  But I've always said, instead of just putting up Bush and Obama, let's put up David Rockefeller.
[02:12:28.089 --> 02:12:29.209]  Let's put up Ted Turner.
[02:12:29.209 --> 02:12:31.211]  Let's put up the real controllers.
[02:12:31.211 --> 02:12:33.792]  Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, the Queen of England.
[02:12:33.792 --> 02:12:37.715]  That's why I've done spoofs defiling the Queen of England.
[02:12:37.715 --> 02:12:38.616]  She's not my god.
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:42.602]  Everybody bowing down and worshipping her.
[02:12:42.602 --> 02:12:45.345]  Our founding fathers burned effigies of the royals.
[02:12:45.345 --> 02:12:47.007]  That's what America is.
[02:12:47.007 --> 02:12:49.449]  Not worshipping the Queen when she comes here.
[02:12:49.449 --> 02:12:55.656]  But the gateway to find out they're all puppets, and to get to the real elite, is InfoWars.com.
[02:12:55.656 --> 02:12:56.517]  And Obama.
[02:12:56.517 --> 02:12:57.918]  So you wear this shirt.
[02:12:57.918 --> 02:12:58.779]  Get in their face.
[02:12:58.779 --> 02:13:00.321]  Let them know you're an American.
[02:13:00.321 --> 02:13:01.902]  And they get in your face and say, I don't like that shirt.
[02:13:01.902 --> 02:13:03.224]  Say, oh, but you liked it when it was Bush.
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:07.461]  And then explain to them, by the way, I'm not for Bush either.
[02:13:07.461 --> 02:13:12.822]  And I told my guys, we just got so busy getting these eight shirts made, I do want a George Bush.
[02:13:12.822 --> 02:13:18.743]  Just tell Janae, our graphics girl, take the White House photo of Bush and make it look like this one.
[02:13:18.743 --> 02:13:22.784]  I want it, you know, same style, same look.
[02:13:22.784 --> 02:13:27.685]  I want to get a shirt up of that by tomorrow.
[02:13:27.685 --> 02:13:29.465]  We can put the order in tomorrow.
[02:13:29.465 --> 02:13:30.525]  We can have them here by Monday.
[02:13:30.525 --> 02:13:32.166]  Our great guy that
[02:13:33.564 --> 02:13:36.668]  Makes these shirts for us up in New York.
[02:13:36.668 --> 02:13:39.752]  She does a fabulous job made right here in the good old USA.
[02:13:39.752 --> 02:13:41.775]  And so we're gonna have a Bush one for you too.
[02:13:41.775 --> 02:13:49.585]  We're also doing one with Bush and Obama as vampires drinking blood from the Statue of Liberty to say they're both jokers.
[02:13:49.585 --> 02:13:50.707]  See, that's what it's all about.
[02:13:53.581 --> 02:13:55.483]  I'm going to give each caller a minute because I've got to get to people.
[02:13:55.483 --> 02:13:56.485]  I promise to take a lot of calls.
[02:13:56.485 --> 02:13:59.649]  We did a good job the first hour, decent hour the second hour.
[02:13:59.649 --> 02:14:00.810]  I'm doing a terrible job now.
[02:14:00.810 --> 02:14:03.434]  Let's get to your calls and then I'm going to get to all the news.
[02:14:03.434 --> 02:14:08.700]  Democrat Representative Burton says, speaking your mind is an act of political terrorism.
[02:14:09.858 --> 02:14:11.779]  And that's what the hate speech law says.
[02:14:11.779 --> 02:14:14.961]  This is the Louisville Courier-Journal.
[02:14:14.961 --> 02:14:16.322]  I mean, this is mainstream news.
[02:14:16.322 --> 02:14:19.124]  They're saying speech is bad now.
[02:14:19.124 --> 02:14:22.246]  Now, folks, I know it sounds extreme and radical, but it's not.
[02:14:22.246 --> 02:14:25.348]  In America, you used to have free speech.
[02:14:25.348 --> 02:14:28.550]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:29.530]  That's key.
[02:14:29.530 --> 02:14:30.591]  That's coming up.
[02:14:30.591 --> 02:14:31.612]  That's up on Prison Planet.
[02:14:31.612 --> 02:14:36.295]  But right now, who's up next here first?
[02:14:36.295 --> 02:14:37.656]  Richard and P.A., you're on the air.
[02:14:37.656 --> 02:14:38.036]  Go ahead.
[02:14:39.025 --> 02:14:40.726]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:14:40.726 --> 02:14:46.108]  A gentleman was on earlier and he said to pray in the rosary.
[02:14:46.108 --> 02:14:49.749]  Well, my opinion is we ought to hold our politicians to the Ten Commandments.
[02:14:49.749 --> 02:14:52.930]  They are not being lived up to.
[02:14:52.930 --> 02:14:53.771]  I agree with you, sir.
[02:14:53.771 --> 02:14:57.052]  What else is on your mind?
[02:14:57.052 --> 02:14:58.792]  A lot.
[02:14:58.792 --> 02:15:03.774]  This health care deal is a bunch of crap.
[02:15:03.774 --> 02:15:08.156]  Our government, well, my father, grandfather,
[02:15:09.073 --> 02:15:13.025]  And great-great-grandfather, all foot wars.
[02:15:13.025 --> 02:15:16.514]  And the way our government is going today, we're going to have one in the streets.
[02:15:20.851 --> 02:15:28.698]  Well, that could be the false flag, is that they know, again, they've been building this police state up, building NORTHCOM up for decades.
[02:15:28.698 --> 02:15:31.340]  It didn't get set up in 2002, as we've been told.
[02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:32.381]  We have the government documents.
[02:15:32.381 --> 02:15:33.703]  Clinton gave speeches about it.
[02:15:33.703 --> 02:15:38.807]  They've been building this internal national police control grid up to this point.
[02:15:38.807 --> 02:15:41.510]  Now they're launching all the crises at once.
[02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:43.271]  I think they want a violent revolution.
[02:15:43.271 --> 02:15:46.694]  They're probably going to stage terror attacks and say, we did it.
[02:15:46.694 --> 02:15:47.395]  Now I've been predicting
[02:15:47.555 --> 02:15:54.663]  Well, like I said, I think we ought to hold the politicians to the Ten Commandments and also use the Constitution to throw the bums out.
[02:16:08.610 --> 02:16:15.840]  I agree, and I appreciate your call, but the thing I'm trying to make clear here is we've got to explain who's behind the terror.
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:17.101]  Who has the motive?
[02:16:17.101 --> 02:16:19.705]  Who's been caught doing it before?
[02:16:19.705 --> 02:16:24.451]  I mean, folks, I understand them so well, but it's really not even hard to do.
[02:16:24.451 --> 02:16:25.512]  It's not like it's some feat.
[02:16:26.909 --> 02:16:35.091]  It'd be like if I said to my wife, honey, it's gonna get dark in about an hour, and it was eight o'clock at night, everybody knows it's about to get dark, and it got dark.
[02:16:35.091 --> 02:16:38.272]  She would say, oh my gosh, you're the greatest genius on earth.
[02:16:38.272 --> 02:16:39.713]  I know how they work.
[02:16:39.713 --> 02:16:42.233]  These guys bombed OKC.
[02:16:42.233 --> 02:16:44.514]  These guys carry out the terror attacks.
[02:16:44.514 --> 02:16:47.955]  Every time they politically are losing, they stage terror attacks.
[02:16:47.955 --> 02:16:50.276]  That's in Army Field Manuals.
[02:16:50.276 --> 02:16:53.037]  In fact, will you guys search engine Army Field Manual 2004,
[02:16:57.335 --> 02:16:58.636]  False flag.
[02:16:58.636 --> 02:16:59.176]  That'll get it.
[02:16:59.176 --> 02:17:01.657]  And I want to, because I forget the exact field manual number.
[02:17:01.657 --> 02:17:05.238]  This is officially a secret Army field manual.
[02:17:05.238 --> 02:17:08.300]  The news admitted a year ago when this came out it was real.
[02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:10.380]  The Army got mad and said that's classified.
[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:11.361]  WikiLeaks put it out.
[02:17:12.284 --> 02:17:17.189]  Now, we already know the army did the stay-behind networks and the NATO option and Gladio.
[02:17:17.189 --> 02:17:23.575]  Every time people in Italy or Germany or another country were about to vote out the government they didn't like, the U.S.
[02:17:23.575 --> 02:17:29.300]  Army goes and stages terror attacks and then blames it on the enemies and the Italian police go and arrest them.
[02:17:30.171 --> 02:17:32.592]  I mean, this is standard procedure.
[02:17:32.592 --> 02:17:33.653]  It's standard.
[02:17:33.653 --> 02:17:40.156]  The American people are about to get their rights back, get us out of the UN, abolish the Federal Reserve in 1995.
[02:17:40.156 --> 02:17:43.177]  The feds blew up their own federal building.
[02:17:43.177 --> 02:17:45.919]  I mean, these people have got aces up their sleeves.
[02:17:45.919 --> 02:17:50.801]  You heard the caller earlier saying, hey, I talked to my sheriff, he knows what's going on, I'm really positive.
[02:17:50.801 --> 02:17:52.782]  Yes, positive things are happening.
[02:17:52.782 --> 02:17:57.905]  But then, we know the establishment is going to stage terror attacks and say, we did it.
[02:17:58.405 --> 02:18:03.007]  Just like the sun came up this morning, and just like the sun's going down tonight.
[02:18:03.007 --> 02:18:07.169]  I mean, it's guaranteed!
[02:18:07.169 --> 02:18:09.931]  Unless we expose their trick.
[02:18:09.931 --> 02:18:13.712]  I mean, if somebody can cheat at cards, as long as you don't know they're cheating.
[02:18:13.712 --> 02:18:23.257]  But the minute you know they're leaning back with their fingers and pulling aces out of their sleeve, the minute you know they're doing that trick in the sleeve, it's over!
[02:18:23.257 --> 02:18:24.918]  You're like, hey, you're cheating!
[02:18:24.918 --> 02:18:26.218]  Give me my money back!
[02:18:26.218 --> 02:18:27.139]  You're cheating at poker!
[02:18:28.103 --> 02:18:29.083]  Thomas in Jersey.
[02:18:29.083 --> 02:18:30.904]  You're on the air, Thomas.
[02:18:30.904 --> 02:18:32.264]  Regards, Alex.
[02:18:32.264 --> 02:18:32.604]  Regards.
[02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:37.945]  I wanted to give you a heads up on one of the aces up their sleeves.
[02:18:37.945 --> 02:18:41.366]  I give you self-assembling block polymers.
[02:18:41.366 --> 02:18:43.826]  They're putting it in all vitamins, all supplements.
[02:18:43.826 --> 02:18:45.107]  It's in the water.
[02:18:45.107 --> 02:18:46.247]  It's in the food.
[02:18:46.247 --> 02:18:47.467]  It's in everything.
[02:18:47.467 --> 02:18:49.308]  Alcohol, soda.
[02:18:49.308 --> 02:18:50.448]  It's a living plastic.
[02:18:50.448 --> 02:18:52.708]  It self-assembles in the body.
[02:18:52.708 --> 02:18:55.689]  It replicates and mutates and changes our DNA.
[02:18:58.809 --> 02:19:10.398]  Well, I happen to have German news and other mainstream news where they admit it's grown on dead fetal tissue, the Novartis vaccine, the big one the U.S.
[02:19:10.398 --> 02:19:18.244]  government bought, and that it has live cancer viruses in it.
[02:19:18.244 --> 02:19:27.151]  And that's out of... They're actually poly... They're grown in like a poly... What do you call it?
[02:19:27.151 --> 02:19:27.732]  Like a sediment.
[02:19:28.479 --> 02:19:29.319]  They grow it in the lab.
[02:19:29.319 --> 02:19:33.200]  It's made from just a polyfill.
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:36.241]  Well stay there because you sound like you work in one of these labs.
[02:19:36.241 --> 02:19:39.022]  I just go off with the medical doctor saying what the news says.
[02:19:39.022 --> 02:19:51.106]  They grow the cancer viruses in caterpillar eggs, in dead baby retina tissue for some reason, and in dead dog tissue and dead monkey tissue.
[02:19:51.106 --> 02:19:54.487]  So dogs, monkeys, dead babies, and caterpillar eggs.
[02:19:57.543 --> 02:20:01.064]  And maybe you can explain to me this other thing you're talking about.
[02:20:01.064 --> 02:20:02.765]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:20:02.765 --> 02:20:04.505]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:20:04.505 --> 02:20:07.186]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:20:07.186 --> 02:20:12.328]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:20:12.328 --> 02:20:15.529]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:21:01.923 --> 02:21:04.165]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:21:04.165 --> 02:21:07.088]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:21:07.088 --> 02:21:15.696]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:21:15.696 --> 02:21:19.379]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:21:19.379 --> 02:21:23.903]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:21:23.903 --> 02:21:25.505]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:21:25.885 --> 02:21:26.946]  Take action now!
[02:21:26.946 --> 02:21:31.748]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:21:31.748 --> 02:21:35.730]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[02:21:35.730 --> 02:21:39.051]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:21:39.051 --> 02:21:45.494]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[02:21:45.794 --> 02:21:51.756]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:21:51.756 --> 02:21:54.076]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[02:21:54.076 --> 02:21:59.618]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:21:59.618 --> 02:22:03.099]  It is a big idea.
[02:22:03.099 --> 02:22:05.920]  A new world order.
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:09.581]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful force.
[02:22:10.916 --> 02:22:13.639]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:22:13.639 --> 02:22:16.423]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[02:22:16.423 --> 02:22:19.606]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[02:22:19.606 --> 02:22:26.935]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:22:29.943 --> 02:22:35.387]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:22:35.387 --> 02:22:39.269]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:22:39.269 --> 02:22:41.831]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:22:41.831 --> 02:22:42.992]  Most people have no idea.
[02:22:42.992 --> 02:22:43.772]  They're not after money.
[02:22:43.772 --> 02:22:45.053]  They have all the money they need.
[02:22:45.053 --> 02:22:46.054]  They're after power.
[02:22:46.054 --> 02:22:47.195]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[02:22:47.195 --> 02:22:55.900]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:55.900 --> 02:22:58.722]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:22:58.722 --> 02:22:59.803]  You have been warned.
[02:22:59.923 --> 02:23:00.019]  Yeah.
[02:23:01.343 --> 02:23:07.645]  If you'd like to replace the ineffective and toxic cleaning products under your sink, you need to visit BioGreenClean.com.
[02:23:07.645 --> 02:23:15.007]  BioGreenClean is the first heavy-duty, all-natural, multi-purpose cleaner that outperforms every other competitive cleaning product on the market today.

[02:23:30.672 --> 02:23:31.312]  We're good to go.
[02:24:05.863 --> 02:24:19.052]  Yeah You can actually read the 219 page US military counterinsurgency manual and the document site
[02:24:30.262 --> 02:24:32.104]  Scribd.com has it.
[02:24:32.104 --> 02:24:32.865]  Flashback!
[02:24:32.865 --> 02:24:33.185]  U.S.
[02:24:33.185 --> 02:24:35.227]  counterinsurgency manual leaked.
[02:24:35.227 --> 02:24:37.449]  Calls for false flag operations.
[02:24:37.449 --> 02:24:39.472]  Suspension of human rights.
[02:24:39.472 --> 02:24:41.333]  How to stage terror attacks.
[02:24:41.333 --> 02:24:42.915]  How to torture people.
[02:24:42.915 --> 02:24:48.881]  And the Army admits this is their document.
[02:24:48.881 --> 02:24:50.002]  So, just so you know.
[02:24:50.002 --> 02:24:51.804]  I mean, staging terror attacks is 101.
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:25:00.964]  So, the feds probably already have operations in motion, getting truck bomb ready, whatever.
[02:25:00.964 --> 02:25:05.646]  And just look, feds, when they kill a bunch of you and blow your daycares up, don't get mad at me, okay?
[02:25:05.646 --> 02:25:07.847]  I'm not the one blowing your daycares up.
[02:25:07.847 --> 02:25:11.629]  I guarantee you the media is going to have my face up there when your bosses kill you.
[02:25:13.564 --> 02:25:19.185]  And if I was the Feds, there's no way I'd work in a federal building with the history of your bosses targeting your kids.
[02:25:19.185 --> 02:25:24.346]  And of course, this bomb, because they know people hate Feds, will be put right by daycare.
[02:25:24.346 --> 02:25:26.026]  They're going to pick a place with a daycare.
[02:25:26.026 --> 02:25:26.746]  You watch.
[02:25:26.746 --> 02:25:29.227]  When they blow up your federal building, they're going to pick a daycare.
[02:25:29.227 --> 02:25:31.547]  Because they love to show dead kids.
[02:25:31.547 --> 02:25:37.688]  And they'll have people come out with the dead kid bloody on TV and say, the Bill of Rights did this, the gun owners did this.
[02:25:37.688 --> 02:25:41.069]  And then all these idiots will say, oh, the Bill of Rights is bad.
[02:25:41.069 --> 02:25:42.769]  See, that's how these people operate.
[02:25:44.241 --> 02:25:47.083]  Let's go back to your phone calls here.
[02:25:47.083 --> 02:25:49.525]  Let's talk to Rich in New York.
[02:25:49.525 --> 02:25:50.406]  Rich, you're on the air.
[02:25:50.406 --> 02:25:51.987]  Go ahead.
[02:25:51.987 --> 02:25:53.889]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[02:25:53.889 --> 02:25:55.070]  Welcome.
[02:25:55.070 --> 02:25:55.711]  Welcome.
[02:25:55.711 --> 02:25:56.952]  I love your show, man.
[02:25:56.952 --> 02:25:59.294]  I gotta say, I also dig your bump music.
[02:25:59.294 --> 02:26:03.637]  Wish you would play a little more Frank Zappa, because he knew it was going on for decades.
[02:26:03.637 --> 02:26:10.163]  Anyway, I'm a healthcare worker in New York City, and I had an idea about how to avoid the flu shot.
[02:26:11.195 --> 02:26:11.476]  I think so.
[02:26:27.523 --> 02:26:29.445]  But look, I mean, it's more than just that.
[02:26:29.445 --> 02:26:40.874]  They're ordering the medical workers, I remember, I think it was you that called a few weeks ago and said, I just got the document, but since then it's been all over the news that they are forcing healthcare workers to take it, which is threatening them with their job.
[02:26:40.874 --> 02:26:42.335]  There's no law.
[02:26:42.335 --> 02:26:44.937]  You were that guy, right?
[02:26:44.937 --> 02:26:45.538]  Yes.
[02:26:45.538 --> 02:26:46.298]  Yeah, okay.
[02:26:46.298 --> 02:26:51.763]  I called Jason, I called Burmess up and spoke to him about the black ops helicopters a while back, I don't know.
[02:26:52.876 --> 02:26:57.340]  So it was another guy from New York who was told they had to take the flu shots?
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:58.001]  That's all the news.
[02:26:58.001 --> 02:27:00.543]  The unions are fighting right now.
[02:27:00.543 --> 02:27:03.666]  I just want to get this straight because this is really getting wild here.
[02:27:03.666 --> 02:27:11.953]  Are you the caller, I'm just seeing if my memory's right, are you the caller that called a few weeks ago and said you guys have been told you had to take the flu shot?
[02:27:13.607 --> 02:27:15.408]  I had called several times.
[02:27:15.408 --> 02:27:16.428]  I might have got in on there.
[02:27:16.428 --> 02:27:18.008]  It was an agenda that I had.
[02:27:18.008 --> 02:27:19.529]  They asked me what I wanted to talk about.
[02:27:19.529 --> 02:27:22.650]  I don't think I got through, but yeah, it's definitely going on.
[02:27:22.650 --> 02:27:24.230]  So it was another medical worker.
[02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:31.673]  I was just saying, the issue is, is this is really going on, that they're ordering people, through color of law, that they've got to take these shots.
[02:27:32.333 --> 02:27:50.306]  And I think now they've actually got that to the point where they have, well, 1199's always been a little political as far as siding with the wrong people, but seems like they're trying to move towards getting their health care workers to do this, and they won't protect them.
[02:27:50.306 --> 02:27:58.212]  So my thing, my question to you, sir, is, is there a way, maybe through relinquishing your power of attorney,
[02:27:59.099 --> 02:28:00.400]  I've seen that.
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:02.221]  Government power of attorney over you.
[02:28:02.221 --> 02:28:06.204]  And just relinquish it and say, no, you don't have power of attorney over me.
[02:28:06.204 --> 02:28:14.630]  Well, I mean, they've got a... I guess with our license and our social and all that, signing off on that, but... Sure, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:21.936]  There's an executive order and a UN treaty saying they can forcibly inject you, lock you down, shoot you if they need to.
[02:28:21.936 --> 02:28:23.397]  That's all on record.
[02:28:23.397 --> 02:28:24.598]  We've covered it here at Nauseam.
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:30.926]  You want to find it, just search engine, uh, Executive Order Quarantine.
[02:28:30.926 --> 02:28:36.092]  And that brings up CBS News first, and then it's got the Executive Order there for you.
[02:28:36.092 --> 02:28:39.116]  And it says it all there in one article, that's why I mentioned that one.
[02:28:39.116 --> 02:28:43.020]  Because there's still denial this is going on in big quarters out there.
[02:28:43.721 --> 02:28:48.083]  The COINTELPRO says that I'm the one making this up and this isn't the news.
[02:28:48.083 --> 02:28:51.184]  Or that I'm making up there's a plan to poison our water.
[02:28:51.184 --> 02:29:03.989]  Or I'm making up that they want to euthanize us when it's all in their own documents and their own statements and their Biological Diversity Treaty 1996 and their Club of Rome documents and all of it.
[02:29:03.989 --> 02:29:06.230]  But in books like Ecoscience,
[02:29:07.771 --> 02:29:09.377]  No, this is really going on.
[02:29:09.377 --> 02:29:13.793]  They're really telling healthcare workers, police, military, you've got to take this shot.
[02:29:14.907 --> 02:29:16.829]  And most of them are saying no.
[02:29:16.829 --> 02:29:19.171]  So it looks like the program is going to stall.
[02:29:19.171 --> 02:29:28.638]  But, they're going to go ahead and create fear and hype over a few thousand people dying normally of flu in this season, as they always do.
[02:29:28.638 --> 02:29:30.620]  And then you're going to have huge hordes of people.
[02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:36.565]  I mean, over a couple deaths, they had people lined up in Austin hospitals and every other hospital in the country.
[02:29:36.565 --> 02:29:39.127]  I saw the same reports all over the nation.
[02:29:39.127 --> 02:29:44.351]  Freaking out, panicking, wanting last year's shot, even though they admitted it wouldn't protect them and help them.
[02:29:45.922 --> 02:29:48.064]  Okay.
[02:29:48.064 --> 02:29:49.325]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:29:49.325 --> 02:29:50.466]  I'm going to get into all this news.
[02:29:50.466 --> 02:29:51.627]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.627 --> 02:29:53.008]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.008 --> 02:29:54.629]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.629 --> 02:29:58.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.274 --> 02:30:04.276]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.276 --> 02:30:09.601]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:09.601 --> 02:30:11.662]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:11.662 --> 02:30:16.646]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:16.646 --> 02:30:17.567]  How much do you want?
[02:30:17.827 --> 02:30:18.948]  When do you want it?
[02:30:18.948 --> 02:30:20.830]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:20.830 --> 02:30:21.911]  When will you need it?
[02:30:21.911 --> 02:30:24.113]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.113 --> 02:30:25.454]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.454 --> 02:30:26.976]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:26.976 --> 02:30:32.261]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.261 --> 02:30:35.844]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:35.844 --> 02:30:39.308]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:39.648 --> 02:30:40.869]  How much will you need?
[02:30:40.869 --> 02:30:41.770]  We don't know.
[02:30:41.770 --> 02:30:42.891]  How much do you want?
[02:30:42.891 --> 02:30:43.812]  All you can get.
[02:30:43.812 --> 02:30:44.913]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:44.913 --> 02:30:47.956]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:47.956 --> 02:30:49.738]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:49.738 --> 02:30:50.658]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.273 --> 02:31:05.600]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:10.126]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.126 --> 02:31:12.389]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:14.011]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.011 --> 02:31:15.053]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.273 --> 02:31:23.699]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:32:00.247 --> 02:32:04.491]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:32:04.491 --> 02:32:06.492]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:32:06.492 --> 02:32:15.020]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:20.564]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:22.186]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:32:22.426 --> 02:32:28.952]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:32:28.952 --> 02:32:40.002]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:32:40.002 --> 02:32:40.463]  That's right.
[02:32:40.743 --> 02:32:43.325]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:32:43.325 --> 02:32:45.086]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[02:32:45.086 --> 02:32:45.387]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:32:45.387 --> 02:32:47.968]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:32:47.968 --> 02:32:48.549]  That's Ecolablue.com.
[02:33:04.028 --> 02:33:10.669]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:33:10.669 --> 02:33:16.270]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:16.270 --> 02:33:19.011]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:19.011 --> 02:33:22.151]  We've just got new reports in that are off the chart.
[02:33:22.151 --> 02:33:27.752]  National Guard drill at high school to prepare for possible H1N1 riot.
[02:33:27.752 --> 02:33:31.113]  National Guard takes over school in swine flu vaccine riot drill.
[02:33:32.813 --> 02:33:36.277]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[02:33:36.277 --> 02:33:38.980]  This is really happening.
[02:33:38.980 --> 02:33:43.024]  Now I'm going to go over all this in about 10 minutes.
[02:33:43.024 --> 02:33:47.970]  Call everyone you know, everybody that's asking what's going on with the flu.
[02:33:47.970 --> 02:33:48.771]  Is it deadly?
[02:33:48.771 --> 02:33:50.072]  Is it not deadly?
[02:33:50.072 --> 02:33:51.013]  What's the plan?
[02:33:51.013 --> 02:33:52.274]  What's happening in America?
[02:33:53.254 --> 02:33:54.115]  We're going to break it down.
[02:33:54.115 --> 02:34:07.826]  I'm going to continue taking calls and then in about 10 minutes I'm going to get into this because it's just really hitting me that I have become so conditioned to the fact that these people are doing this that I'm not responding to this as seriously as I should.
[02:34:07.826 --> 02:34:13.471]  They are clearly going to make their move unless we get the word out and scream bloody murder.
[02:34:13.471 --> 02:34:14.892]  This is not a drill.
[02:34:14.892 --> 02:34:16.394]  This is not a game.
[02:34:16.394 --> 02:34:17.795]  This is happening!
[02:34:21.817 --> 02:34:23.378]  Now I'm going to give each caller one minute.
[02:34:23.378 --> 02:34:24.658]  I have to.
[02:34:24.658 --> 02:34:27.859]  George in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:34:27.859 --> 02:34:28.960]  I'll be on in less than a minute.
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:32.541]  Thank you for being the Paul Revere of our time.
[02:34:32.541 --> 02:34:39.704]  As far as them cutting the internet off, my internet technician son said if you could set up a virtual private network
[02:34:40.616 --> 02:34:49.420]  To allow us to get into your site, maybe through your TV network as part of a paid bonus or through paid GCN.
[02:34:49.420 --> 02:34:52.802]  Yes, the problem is that there are hubs.
[02:34:53.755 --> 02:34:57.557]  There are major backbone systems that they're going to shut down.
[02:34:57.557 --> 02:34:58.838]  That's not our opinion.
[02:34:58.838 --> 02:35:01.199]  In fact, search engine this headline for folks.
[02:35:01.199 --> 02:35:03.880]  Should Obama be able to shut off the web?
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:14.226]  And then you'll see Mother Jones, The Nation, New York Times saying to save the web, they have to kill the web and go to a thing where you only have a few thousand choices.
[02:35:15.086 --> 02:35:17.348]  So it's turning it into glorified cable.
[02:35:17.348 --> 02:35:19.290]  They are really doing that.
[02:35:19.290 --> 02:35:20.391]  Here's a good one.
[02:35:20.391 --> 02:35:26.255]  But the point is, should President Obama have the power to shut down domestic internet traffic?
[02:35:26.255 --> 02:35:31.320]  This is what cyber security and the Air Force and Pentagon setting up these hubs is doing.
[02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:35.002]  Of course we can set up private networks over phone lines and stuff.
[02:35:35.002 --> 02:35:36.963]  It's kind of like the old BBS system.
[02:35:36.963 --> 02:35:46.490]  But for the big, massive pull we have, reaching tens of millions a week now, and yes, that's what we're reaching, it's a scary responsibility, we will not have that anymore.
[02:35:46.490 --> 02:35:59.398]  So people better save this information, save these videos, get them on their computers off the web, and have libraries so that you'll have the material to give people if things continue to implode and collapse.
[02:35:59.398 --> 02:35:59.979]  But go ahead, sir.
[02:36:00.677 --> 02:36:01.177]  Question.
[02:36:01.177 --> 02:36:04.379]  I'm taking two more info warriors that you're suggesting.
[02:36:04.379 --> 02:36:07.361]  You thought the people with the money were headed for the Cook Islands.
[02:36:07.361 --> 02:36:08.861]  We're going to go see if we can find them.
[02:36:08.861 --> 02:36:12.303]  Do you have any idea where they might be there?
[02:36:12.303 --> 02:36:13.544]  Say that again?
[02:36:13.544 --> 02:36:17.806]  You suggested that the people with the big money might be hiding out in the Cook Islands.
[02:36:17.806 --> 02:36:18.967]  Well, there's no maybe.
[02:36:18.967 --> 02:36:24.830]  I was saying that Austin is the richest town in the country per capita.
[02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:27.932]  It's like the vacation spot, the home away from home,
[02:36:28.999 --> 02:36:31.262]  of the money from Florida, New York.
[02:36:33.015 --> 02:36:37.499]  This is where people in New England come during the winter.
[02:36:37.499 --> 02:36:40.842]  Austin is now the wealthiest city in the country per capita.
[02:36:40.842 --> 02:36:47.528]  There's other areas like San Francisco or Manhattan or places where there's more money, but per capita, a lot of money lives here.
[02:36:47.528 --> 02:36:53.433]  And I've got lawyers and friends and people that serve the elite as their lawyers.
[02:36:53.433 --> 02:36:55.755]  I know people that are billionaires.
[02:36:55.755 --> 02:36:58.538]  They've all left the country in the last three years.
[02:36:58.538 --> 02:36:59.619]  They've gone to Switzerland,
[02:37:00.239 --> 02:37:10.804]  They've gone to Cook Islands, they've gone to New Zealand, they're not even really going to Costa Rica, that's kind of the poor guy place to go, like for old spooks and people, old CIA folks.
[02:37:10.804 --> 02:37:21.329]  So, yeah, you go to the Cook Islands in places, I mean, the Cook Islands are big, they have big towns and cities, and you go to the rich neighborhoods with armored fences and security guards, that's where they are.
[02:37:21.329 --> 02:37:24.250]  I wanted to look for more, bring the information back.
[02:37:24.250 --> 02:37:25.291]  Thank you for your service.
[02:37:25.291 --> 02:37:27.752]  Alright, God bless you, I appreciate it.
[02:37:27.752 --> 02:37:29.053]  No, I mean, there's no secret.
[02:37:29.915 --> 02:37:34.398]  I mean, Google rich-fleeing United States, rich-fleeing Israel.
[02:37:34.398 --> 02:37:37.960]  Israel is probably going to get nuked or something.
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:39.841]  Maybe even by Israel.
[02:37:39.841 --> 02:37:46.926]  Of the top ten richest people, that was a Jerusalem Post article or was it Haaretz?
[02:37:46.926 --> 02:37:52.810]  Of the top ten, if memory serves, seven of them have left.
[02:37:52.810 --> 02:37:53.270]  Okay?
[02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:54.051]  They're leaving.
[02:37:54.051 --> 02:37:55.872]  They're leaving the U.S., they're leaving Israel.
[02:38:03.035 --> 02:38:03.856]  Who's up next, John?
[02:38:03.856 --> 02:38:08.640]  My list just changed.
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:12.543]  Matt and PA, you're on the air.
[02:38:12.543 --> 02:38:13.404]  Hello.
[02:38:13.404 --> 02:38:15.126]  Hi.
[02:38:15.126 --> 02:38:23.834]  Why does anybody who would administer a shot, the H1N1 vaccine, need to be deputized?
[02:38:23.834 --> 02:38:26.416]  Because they admittedly are going to be forcing you to take it.
[02:38:27.281 --> 02:38:32.283]  Well, that's right on, uh, I got a link right off of Drudge, uh, linking to Boston.com.
[02:38:32.283 --> 02:38:34.524]  No, I, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:38:34.524 --> 02:38:41.287]  The Massachusetts is deputizing, uh, dentists and pharmaceutics, uh, pharmacists and healthcare workers.
[02:38:43.678 --> 02:38:44.579]  Absolutely.
[02:38:44.579 --> 02:38:44.999]  Here it is.
[02:38:44.999 --> 02:38:46.399]  Here's the article right here.
[02:38:46.399 --> 02:38:48.140]  We'll zoom in on it for everybody.
[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:51.082]  State takes extra steps to battle flu in fall.
[02:38:51.082 --> 02:38:57.886]  Massachusetts health authorities took the unprecedented step yesterday of deputizing dentists, paramedics, and pharmacists to help administer vaccines.
[02:38:58.906 --> 02:39:03.348]  Against both the seasonal flu and novel swine expected to make a return visit.
[02:39:03.348 --> 02:39:05.069]  Why couldn't healthcare workers give the shots?
[02:39:05.069 --> 02:39:06.589]  They're going to be forcing them.
[02:39:06.589 --> 02:39:10.111]  This is the model state's Health Emergency Powers Act.
[02:39:10.111 --> 02:39:12.571]  This is not our opinion.
[02:39:12.571 --> 02:39:23.516]  Now again, they may set all this up, create fear, have people panic and beg for the shots, just to create the image of people begging for it, and then the real attack comes two, three years down the road.
[02:39:24.574 --> 02:39:26.115]  That could be what's happening.
[02:39:26.115 --> 02:39:32.458]  But there's no doubt at stage, there's no doubt they're hyping it, there's no doubt they're bringing in the martial law.
[02:39:32.458 --> 02:39:35.820]  Now, are they going to fully, fully implement it?
[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:36.820]  I don't know.
[02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:46.305]  But, all this COINTELPRO, the last six months, all over talk radio, in the last eight months, since January, I've been saying, I believe they're going to play the flu card.
[02:39:46.305 --> 02:39:48.506]  I believe they're going to play the flu card.
[02:39:48.506 --> 02:39:50.467]  Knowing the enemy.
[02:39:50.467 --> 02:39:52.808]  Seeing their preparations, their conditioning.
[02:39:53.638 --> 02:39:55.119]  No, just keep up the good fight, man.
[02:40:23.363 --> 02:40:25.744]  Oh, I just wish it wasn't real.
[02:40:25.744 --> 02:40:29.906]  Believe me, I wish I wasn't telling the truth.
[02:40:29.906 --> 02:40:39.711]  I told people back in October they threatened Congress with martial law because we had sources, and then a few days later it came out on C-SPAN and people still say I'm a liar.
[02:40:39.711 --> 02:40:46.055]  I can have Senator Inhofe, Congressman, who's the one from California we always have on, Sherman.
[02:40:46.835 --> 02:40:50.098]  Ron Paul has told you and now it's been in the mainstream news.
[02:40:50.098 --> 02:40:52.399]  I mean, it's really happening.
[02:40:52.399 --> 02:40:57.784]  I mean, they really say they're poisoning our water and want to sterilize us and take all the children at birth.
[02:40:57.784 --> 02:41:04.289]  They really say they're taking the kids in England now, starting with 22,000 families, and making them guilty first.
[02:41:04.989 --> 02:41:09.412]  Just taking the kids and raising them in government facilities and cameras in the people's homes.
[02:41:09.412 --> 02:41:11.093]  I mean, people don't believe that.
[02:41:11.093 --> 02:41:15.076]  Just Google 22,000 cameras to watch 20 people in British homes.
[02:41:15.076 --> 02:41:23.922]  I mean, you can't make it up!
[02:41:23.922 --> 02:41:27.445]  It could all end if we just stand up and realize these are criminals running things.
[02:41:27.445 --> 02:41:28.305]  It would all end.
[02:41:28.305 --> 02:41:29.186]  It would all end.
[02:41:32.301 --> 02:41:38.605]  You know, I use Hollywood movies as parallels or analogies because the public may not know history, but they know Hollywood movies.
[02:41:38.605 --> 02:41:41.446]  And I was jogging for an hour this morning.
[02:41:41.446 --> 02:41:47.069]  Even though the world's going to hell in a handbasket, I've made the commitment to take that time out every day.
[02:41:47.069 --> 02:41:50.912]  And it's a parable of how slow and easy wins the race.
[02:41:50.912 --> 02:41:53.573]  Taking action actually pays off.
[02:41:53.573 --> 02:41:56.255]  I've lost 36, 37 pounds now.
[02:41:56.255 --> 02:41:58.696]  I'm going to lose another 30 plus.
[02:41:58.696 --> 02:41:59.696]  I'm going to go down to 180.
[02:42:03.968 --> 02:42:05.809]  But that's a side issue.
[02:42:05.809 --> 02:42:14.692]  I watched the last hour of 10,000 BC, which is a hypothetical.
[02:42:14.692 --> 02:42:15.892]  It's not really real.
[02:42:15.892 --> 02:42:18.513]  It's kind of legend like some guys from Atlantis.
[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:38.635]  You know, their civilization just destroyed in an earthquake, so they, you know, three white dudes is basically what they are, go into Egypt and the Mediterranean, out the Mediterranean, they park their ship, they con the locals that they're gods, wearing headdresses, fooling them, and then they set up a slave system.
[02:42:39.375 --> 02:42:45.781]  Well, that's actually what the priests in Egypt actually did, and that's the secrets the masons have.
[02:42:45.781 --> 02:42:47.622]  That's the guild secret.
[02:42:47.622 --> 02:42:50.925]  It's actually how to manipulate populations, how to compartmentalize.
[02:42:50.925 --> 02:42:58.131]  So I saw this movie, people have been telling me about it, and most of it's fiction, but it's got some real history set in it.
[02:42:58.131 --> 02:43:00.894]  And it's all how they sit there and con the people.
[02:43:00.894 --> 02:43:01.955]  They're not really gods.
[02:43:03.479 --> 02:43:09.020]  But it's just, a few of them are able, there's only one living by the end of the movie, and finally the guy throws the spear and kills him.
[02:43:09.020 --> 02:43:18.483]  I'm giving the movie away, but you should see it, because adults will see this and won't even get it.
[02:43:18.483 --> 02:43:32.486]  And so you've got this priest classed, only a few hundred priests, and this one con artist, manipulating tens of thousands of slaves, and bowing down, because he knew how to take some minerals and throw it in a fire, and it goes BOOM!
[02:43:34.286 --> 02:43:39.627]  That's what the New World Order is, is a little con artist throwing something in a fire that goes boom.
[02:43:39.627 --> 02:43:40.827]  That's the New World Order.
[02:43:40.827 --> 02:43:50.189]  It's made up, it's magician, it's flim flam, it's theater, it's crud, it's crap, it's lies.
[02:43:50.189 --> 02:43:51.790]  And that's how these globalists operate.
[02:43:51.790 --> 02:44:02.572]  It's why their symbol is the pyramid, is that they sit at the top of the knowledge of how humans work, of psychology, and they use it against us.
[02:44:04.184 --> 02:44:08.151]  I mean, there had been all sorts of expeditions to the North American continent.
[02:44:08.151 --> 02:44:09.593]  Leif Erikson had been here.
[02:44:09.593 --> 02:44:10.976]  Eric the Red had been here.
[02:44:10.976 --> 02:44:14.141]  There were all the maps.
[02:44:14.141 --> 02:44:16.585]  These are in the Royal Archives in England and France.
[02:44:18.041 --> 02:44:21.042]  And Christopher Columbus was a Mason, and they said, here's the map.
[02:44:21.042 --> 02:44:26.124]  We've decided to go ahead and fund, you know, moving into this area and letting people know the world's round.
[02:44:26.124 --> 02:44:28.025]  And he said, thank you.
[02:44:28.025 --> 02:44:29.445]  I'll now go do that.
[02:44:29.445 --> 02:44:32.106]  But that's what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:32.106 --> 02:44:33.907]  This is mainline history.
[02:44:33.907 --> 02:44:35.668]  They just don't teach you that in school.
[02:44:35.668 --> 02:44:39.769]  They tell you, oh, in 1498 or whatever, you know, he found America.
[02:44:39.769 --> 02:44:42.270]  Yeah, right, he did, sure.
[02:44:42.270 --> 02:44:43.611]  And I'm a Chinese jet pilot.
[02:44:45.695 --> 02:44:48.297]  Here's something I want to tell you about the swine flu.
[02:44:48.297 --> 02:44:48.738]  I think that
[02:45:15.256 --> 02:45:39.828]  They made the swine flu, uh, just to, uh, just to get the vaccine, just to make people get the vaccine, and, um, steal all their money, and, like, not, and, like, you know, steal all their money, and then kill the population.
[02:45:39.828 --> 02:45:40.809]  How old are you?
[02:45:40.809 --> 02:45:41.629]  I'm just curious.
[02:45:41.629 --> 02:45:42.870]  How old are you?
[02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:43.230]  Thirteen.
[02:45:44.537 --> 02:45:46.378]  Yeah, well it's good to have you calling in.
[02:45:46.378 --> 02:45:48.400]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:51.182]  I've been listening to the show... two days ago.
[02:45:52.065 --> 02:45:53.726]  Right, good to have you on board.
[02:45:53.726 --> 02:45:55.846]  Listen, it's not just that.
[02:45:55.846 --> 02:45:59.507]  We know the vaccine has cancer viruses, chop full.
[02:45:59.507 --> 02:46:13.212]  We know it has these chemicals that accelerate the autoimmune response that normally cause the brain expansion, that cause the autoimmune response and the brain damaging, that fries your pancreas.
[02:46:13.212 --> 02:46:14.912]  Also, in fact, print this for me.
[02:46:14.912 --> 02:46:16.353]  I had it in the stack last week.
[02:46:16.353 --> 02:46:19.874]  There's a whole bunch of university studies proving that these
[02:46:21.690 --> 02:46:36.846]  These chemicals they add to elicit the autoimmune response in all lab animals causes juvenile or their older whatever age they are massive onset of degenerative and extremely
[02:46:38.439 --> 02:46:40.460]  Debilitative arthritis.
[02:46:40.460 --> 02:46:43.882]  So see, everybody's wondering why I'm 19 and got arthritis.
[02:46:43.882 --> 02:46:46.363]  Well, you took the shots from eugenicists.
[02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:48.725]  You've been hit hard with a bio-attack.
[02:46:48.725 --> 02:46:51.066]  I mean, you know, they're hitting you hard.
[02:46:51.066 --> 02:46:57.790]  They don't write giant government policy books because they want to, you know, write them to just put them on the bookshelf.
[02:46:57.790 --> 02:46:59.210]  These people mean business.
[02:46:59.210 --> 02:47:00.471]  These are men of action.
[02:47:00.471 --> 02:47:01.692]  The world's theirs.
[02:47:01.692 --> 02:47:03.773]  And you ain't in the future, they've got set up.
[02:47:05.362 --> 02:47:09.223]  So yes, you want arthritis when you're 13.
[02:47:09.223 --> 02:47:11.164]  You want to be retarded when you're 20.
[02:47:11.164 --> 02:47:12.805]  You want cancer when you're 40.
[02:47:12.805 --> 02:47:14.845]  Take the shot.
[02:47:14.845 --> 02:47:18.707]  But you're absolutely right, because they're about making money.
[02:47:18.707 --> 02:47:24.649]  When Bayer knowingly shipped out a million plus shots, and everybody that took it was going to get HIV and hepatitis, they made money.
[02:47:24.649 --> 02:47:28.090]  They said, not only am I going to kill you, you're going to pay for me to murder you.
[02:47:28.090 --> 02:47:29.191]  And they said, absolutely.
[02:47:29.191 --> 02:47:30.791]  Let me give you that money.
[02:47:30.791 --> 02:47:31.571]  Just here you go.
[02:47:31.571 --> 02:47:32.272]  You know what?
[02:47:33.132 --> 02:47:34.154]  How much you want?
[02:47:34.154 --> 02:47:36.036]  You want $5 to kill me?
[02:47:36.036 --> 02:47:36.857]  You want another $5?
[02:47:36.857 --> 02:47:39.161]  How about $300 to kill me?
[02:47:39.161 --> 02:47:39.541]  Here you go.
[02:47:39.541 --> 02:47:41.324]  That's about what it costs for that factor aid.
[02:47:41.324 --> 02:47:43.266]  Kill me!
[02:47:43.266 --> 02:47:44.388]  Here, please kill me.
[02:47:44.388 --> 02:47:45.289]  Please kill me.
[02:47:45.289 --> 02:47:45.650]  You bet.
[02:47:45.650 --> 02:47:46.631]  We'll kill you real good.
[02:47:49.127 --> 02:47:53.249]  You try to go protest out front, Bayer, they'll have the cops come over with tasers and taser you!
[02:47:53.249 --> 02:47:55.250]  And those cops will go shoot the kids up!
[02:47:55.250 --> 02:47:57.471]  Oh, here you go, I like my kid being brain damaged!
[02:47:57.471 --> 02:47:58.692]  I'm a cop!
[02:47:58.692 --> 02:47:59.632]  I like having power!
[02:47:59.632 --> 02:48:02.294]  I love being scammed by the priest class!
[02:48:02.294 --> 02:48:04.655]  Up there on the hill, running their fraud on me all day!
[02:48:04.655 --> 02:48:06.096]  It's fun!
[02:48:06.096 --> 02:48:10.758]  I'm sorry, uh... Nikita, go ahead and finish your point.
[02:48:10.758 --> 02:48:18.222]  Yeah, yeah, uh, about that, um... I've heard of the vaccine, cause my mom listens to this Russian radio show,
[02:48:19.116 --> 02:48:21.537]  And it's only been like tested.
[02:48:21.537 --> 02:48:30.663]  It's not, it hasn't been tested on humans, but I think they deliberately killed it, made it.
[02:48:30.663 --> 02:48:32.023]  So, yeah.
[02:48:32.023 --> 02:48:37.326]  I've seen your Endgame video and the Obama Deception.
[02:48:37.326 --> 02:48:47.132]  Uh, right now what they're doing in my school, they're having like, they're making us, uh, the food that we're gonna eat this year is gonna be from
[02:48:48.370 --> 02:48:50.892]  It's going to be from the government.
[02:48:50.892 --> 02:48:52.914]  It's going to be government controlled.
[02:48:52.914 --> 02:48:55.536]  It's from the USDA, so... Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:55.536 --> 02:48:58.698]  You're not allowed to bring your own food.
[02:48:58.698 --> 02:48:59.419]  Well, you're allowed.
[02:48:59.419 --> 02:49:00.720]  You're allowed, still.
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:02.201]  Some schools are phasing out.
[02:49:02.201 --> 02:49:04.603]  No, you've got to eat the special food they've got.
[02:49:04.603 --> 02:49:06.485]  Well, that's what they're phasing in.
[02:49:06.485 --> 02:49:07.625]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:49:07.625 --> 02:49:08.326]  Good to hear from you.
[02:49:08.326 --> 02:49:13.870]  We're going to come back, and in the next segment, the segment after that, I'm going to break down the big news.
[02:49:13.870 --> 02:49:15.672]  The whole grid coming into view.
[02:49:15.672 --> 02:49:16.593]  No more denying.
[02:49:17.685 --> 02:49:20.406]  No more time to live in denial.
[02:49:20.406 --> 02:49:22.686]  No more time.
[02:49:22.686 --> 02:49:26.107]  The vaccines do come from fetal tissue.
[02:49:26.107 --> 02:49:30.949]  In fact, there was a caller earlier I meant to go back to who was saying it was grown in some sediment.
[02:49:30.949 --> 02:49:32.889]  I mean, just search engine in front of everybody.
[02:49:32.889 --> 02:49:37.051]  He may be talking about some other kind of vaccine.
[02:49:37.051 --> 02:49:41.652]  These stem cell, stem line, cloned vaccines.
[02:49:41.652 --> 02:49:43.493]  It's a cloning process.
[02:49:43.493 --> 02:49:44.393]  Well, just search
[02:49:46.365 --> 02:49:53.687]  Vaccines grown in caterpillar eggs, or vaccines grown in fetal tissue.
[02:49:53.687 --> 02:49:54.707]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:49:54.707 --> 02:49:58.408]  So I don't know what that fella's talking about.
[02:49:58.408 --> 02:50:08.110]  But, I know vaccines being grown in eggs, but the eggs, the virus seed though, was originally grown in the fetal tissue.
[02:50:09.033 --> 02:50:12.036]  Or it was, see, the virus lines.
[02:50:12.036 --> 02:50:16.340]  And hey, if you think injecting dead babies is in you is good, go ahead.
[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:17.961]  You know, I'm the extremist.
[02:50:17.961 --> 02:50:24.408]  I'm the bad man who will sit here and pull up articles where they do these tests and it kills 25% of people that take them.
[02:50:24.408 --> 02:50:26.930]  You know, with the bird flu vaccine trial last year.
[02:50:26.930 --> 02:50:27.631]  London Telegraph.
[02:50:28.544 --> 02:50:35.153]  You know, I'm the guy that will sit here and tell you that they're going to use it for martial law, and now it's months later all over the news.
[02:50:35.153 --> 02:50:37.397]  Because we understand the enemy operation.
[02:50:37.397 --> 02:50:40.301]  And again, I keep saying, I've laid out the facts.
[02:50:40.301 --> 02:50:41.222]  We've been right.
[02:50:41.222 --> 02:50:42.884]  We know what we're talking about here.
[02:50:42.884 --> 02:50:44.326]  People better listen!
[02:50:45.506 --> 02:50:47.488]  There's not time to play games.
[02:50:47.488 --> 02:50:49.511]  I'm not risking my life up here for nothing.
[02:50:49.511 --> 02:50:50.592]  This is real.
[02:50:50.592 --> 02:50:52.554]  I don't just believe I'm telling the truth.
[02:50:52.554 --> 02:50:53.095]  I know.
[02:50:53.095 --> 02:50:55.398]  I know I'm right.
[02:50:55.398 --> 02:50:57.400]  All I do is think about this.
[02:50:57.400 --> 02:50:58.522]  All I do is study this.
[02:51:04.352 --> 02:51:09.854]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:51:09.854 --> 02:51:10.635]  and the world.
[02:51:10.635 --> 02:51:14.496]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:51:14.496 --> 02:51:20.999]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:51:20.999 --> 02:51:23.040]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:28.262]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[02:51:28.502 --> 02:51:28.782]  I'm good.

[02:52:04.108 --> 02:52:10.151]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:10.151 --> 02:52:16.015]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:52:16.015 --> 02:52:22.198]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:22.458 --> 02:52:24.479]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:24.479 --> 02:52:26.959]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.959 --> 02:52:40.142]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:40.142 --> 02:52:41.823]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:41.823 --> 02:52:43.683]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:43.683 --> 02:52:49.925]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:53:00.429 --> 02:53:01.590]  The people strike back!
[02:53:03.365 --> 02:53:06.727]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?

[02:53:10.628 --> 02:53:14.370]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:53:14.370 --> 02:53:21.613]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[02:53:21.613 --> 02:53:22.053]  I think so.

[02:54:12.954 --> 02:54:18.498]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[02:54:18.498 --> 02:54:23.120]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:27.743]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[02:54:27.743 --> 02:54:31.265]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[02:54:32.325 --> 02:54:33.226]  It's not a drill.
[02:54:33.226 --> 02:54:34.128]  It's not a game.
[02:54:34.128 --> 02:54:35.609]  It is the real world.
[02:54:35.609 --> 02:54:37.231]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:54:37.231 --> 02:54:39.454]  Wayne Madison coming up in about 10 minutes.
[02:54:39.454 --> 02:54:41.697]  And more of your phone calls.
[02:54:41.697 --> 02:54:43.639]  Here's the bottom line.
[02:54:43.639 --> 02:54:44.860]  When I got up here on air...
[02:54:46.454 --> 02:54:53.197]  In the last 13 years and talked about how the military was preparing to take over America.
[02:54:53.197 --> 02:54:55.158]  I didn't know when it was going to happen.
[02:54:55.158 --> 02:55:02.422]  I just went to urban warfare drills where the military admitted they were and admitted they were practicing to break up our families and take our guns.
[02:55:02.422 --> 02:55:13.688]  Then I found out about Rex 84 and congressional hearings about FEMA camps and I got the congressional video of it and made films and interviewed police chiefs they tried to buy off and
[02:55:16.038 --> 02:55:18.984]  I found out that you have a drug dealing child kidnap.
[02:55:19.821 --> 02:55:20.441]  We're good to go.
[02:55:49.315 --> 02:55:55.417]  And it's been clear in the last seven, eight years, they were gonna use vaccines as one way to do it.
[02:55:55.417 --> 02:56:03.359]  And through the shots, give you a binary weapon, so they can later give you the other half and kill you, but then they won't be affected.
[02:56:03.359 --> 02:56:14.062]  And then it turns out we've got government documents about soft kill weapons, and in here they talk about vaccines that sterilize you, and the South Africans do it, and these big CNN producers have now made a report about it.
[02:56:14.062 --> 02:56:15.442]  I mean, this is really going on.
[02:56:16.482 --> 02:56:20.464]  And it's covered in the film Anthrax War that we carry at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:20.464 --> 02:56:24.405]  They're on the bookstore.
[02:56:24.405 --> 02:56:27.327]  So I told people back in January and March
[02:56:28.351 --> 02:56:33.093]  In April, January, February, March, April, I said, I think they're going to play the flu card.
[02:56:33.093 --> 02:56:35.014]  March 5th, I did a whole show on it.
[02:56:35.014 --> 02:56:36.274]  And I said, they're getting the troops ready.
[02:56:36.274 --> 02:56:37.435]  They're getting the mass graves ready.
[02:56:37.435 --> 02:56:38.876]  They're getting the National Guard ready.
[02:56:38.876 --> 02:56:42.877]  They're getting the troops ready to lock down the cities under NORTHCOM, Brigade Homeland.
[02:56:42.877 --> 02:56:44.698]  It isn't just Bush, it's Obama.
[02:56:44.698 --> 02:56:46.799]  It's seamless integration.
[02:56:46.799 --> 02:56:48.360]  It's all staged.
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:54.042]  People would laugh at me, even when I held up government documents, and they would say it wasn't real.
[02:56:54.042 --> 02:56:56.043]  Now, you can just Google
[02:56:57.631 --> 02:57:09.928]  the term or search engine the term but let's do that for folks right now search engine the term internment resettlement specialist you'll be at army.mil nationalguard.mil
[02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:17.844]  Saying we're setting up camps in America, we need to be able to rehabilitate and re-educate the American people, we need you to run these camps.
[02:57:17.844 --> 02:57:20.125]  And they admit they're building them now and it's all over the news.
[02:57:20.125 --> 02:57:23.547]  See, they just need- the media knew they were there.
[02:57:23.547 --> 02:57:29.291]  They just had to stall long enough to get that it was for the flu in place.
[02:57:29.291 --> 02:57:30.752]  But they built this all years ago.
[02:57:32.301 --> 02:57:34.964]  Now it doesn't mean they're going to do it this fall.
[02:57:34.964 --> 02:57:41.371]  They already tried the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act forced inoculation 2002-2003.
[02:57:41.371 --> 02:57:46.837]  14 million of their own first responders said they wouldn't take the shots, the vast majority, so they suspended it.
[02:57:46.837 --> 02:57:49.640]  They're going to try it again, but each time training us to accept it.
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:53.384]  But with the flu, people weren't scared of them saying you got to take the shots for smallpox.
[02:57:54.338 --> 02:57:56.119]  It's a federalization drill.
[02:57:56.119 --> 02:57:58.621]  It's a UN control grill.
[02:57:58.621 --> 02:57:59.961]  It does all these different things.
[02:57:59.961 --> 02:58:01.722]  It trains us to go under their control.
[02:58:01.722 --> 02:58:07.005]  Trains us to accept in our body what they want to force in our body.
[02:58:07.005 --> 02:58:07.926]  Sets that precedent.
[02:58:09.472 --> 02:58:16.497]  Now everybody's freaking out because CNN's reporting military planning possible H1N1 outbreak.
[02:58:16.497 --> 02:58:20.680]  Gates Memo announces final assimilation of National Guard into the reserves.
[02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:22.140]  Boston.com.
[02:58:22.140 --> 02:58:24.702]  State takes extra steps in flu battle.
[02:58:24.702 --> 02:58:27.384]  Deputizes dentists to others to help with vaccinations.
[02:58:27.384 --> 02:58:28.965]  Forced vaccinations.
[02:58:28.965 --> 02:58:32.547]  Virus vaccine contains cancer viruses.
[02:58:32.547 --> 02:58:33.648]  Build.de.
[02:58:33.648 --> 02:58:35.009]  Top German news.
[02:58:35.009 --> 02:58:37.891]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[02:58:38.231 --> 02:58:40.051]  Now it's all coming out!
[02:58:40.051 --> 02:58:41.432]  Stay with us.

[02:59:53.974 --> 02:59:56.356]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.356 --> 02:59:59.139]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:17.532 --> 03:00:22.236]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:22.236 --> 03:00:30.642]  Wayne Madsen is one of the first international journalists reporting from Capitol Hill, saying the top virologist he talked to said the H1N1 was manufactured.
[03:00:30.642 --> 03:00:33.304]  That then came out in BBC or Spiegel.
[03:00:33.304 --> 03:00:34.005]  They looked at it.
[03:00:34.005 --> 03:00:35.126]  It is manufactured.
[03:00:35.126 --> 03:00:36.206]  They don't know by who.
[03:00:36.206 --> 03:00:43.232]  But the issue is, it's only killed 1,800 and something in the other hemisphere during the peak of the season.
[03:00:44.749 --> 03:00:45.750]  The U.S.
[03:00:45.750 --> 03:00:46.210]  37,000.
[03:00:46.210 --> 03:00:49.451]  36,800 and something, I round up.
[03:00:49.451 --> 03:00:54.113]  Let's just say 36,000, 37,000 die a year from regular flu.
[03:00:54.113 --> 03:00:58.035]  What is gonna happen when tens of thousands die from the flu?
[03:00:58.035 --> 03:01:00.656]  They can shut everything down.
[03:01:00.656 --> 03:01:02.497]  It's training for federal takeover.
[03:01:02.497 --> 03:01:03.517]  Training for U.N.
[03:01:03.517 --> 03:01:03.998]  under Level 6.
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:09.562]  Takeover, which under level 6 were under who control?
[03:01:09.562 --> 03:01:10.902]  World Health Organization.
[03:01:10.902 --> 03:01:22.768]  Now, I kept telling you, because I'm only going off the model state's health emergency powers act, that's federal law, for them to lock down the cities, forcibly inject you, take you to sports stadiums.
[03:01:22.768 --> 03:01:34.833]  I mean, I've read hundreds of articles on air over the last 8 years or so, 7 years, that they've been hyping this, where they admit that they're going to lock down the cities and forcibly inject you.
[03:01:35.495 --> 03:01:37.516]  I mean, it's not like people are saying, how did you know this?
[03:01:37.516 --> 03:01:39.056]  It's all coming true.
[03:01:39.056 --> 03:01:40.376]  This is what they said they were going to do.
[03:01:40.376 --> 03:01:46.698]  So everybody's calling up, freaking out, emails, calls the office, everybody going nuts.
[03:01:46.698 --> 03:01:49.999]  You should be upset, but this is standard procedure.
[03:01:49.999 --> 03:01:52.499]  See, I mean, people keep thinking I'm making all this up.
[03:01:52.499 --> 03:01:54.900]  I'm going off their own admissions.
[03:01:54.900 --> 03:01:58.981]  I keep saying that, but it's incredible.
[03:01:58.981 --> 03:02:03.702]  I mean, I'll get calls from the national media going, you said they were doing gun confiscation drills in Iowa.
[03:02:05.439 --> 03:02:19.951]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center is attacking me all over national news saying I was reading out of the Iowa newspaper where the Army officer was there saying it was a gun confiscation drill.
[03:02:19.951 --> 03:02:23.154]  I mean, it just makes my head spin.
[03:02:23.154 --> 03:02:34.703]  You know, it's like when I tell you there's an Army field manual, and I read the Army field manual number to you earlier, let's punch up the actual manual that tells them how to stage terror attacks against people to blame it on them.
[03:02:37.984 --> 03:03:01.372]  And I told you that the key to them implementing this flu, this dark winter, I told you the key to that would be if they simultaneously say gun owners are malicious, are white supremacist, so they demonize gun owners and malicious, and are planning a strike.
[03:03:01.372 --> 03:03:06.654]  And I said if the Southern Poverty Law Center, because they're the real in the field people,
[03:03:08.601 --> 03:03:11.682]  That's who I always see with their hands and the really dirty stuff.
[03:03:11.682 --> 03:03:15.804]  If you see them come out and say that and launch that play, I mean, they're in motion right now.
[03:03:15.804 --> 03:03:20.146]  Quarterbacks going back, about to do a Hail Mary, and I'm like, Mayday, folks!
[03:03:20.146 --> 03:03:21.567]  They're about to do it!
[03:03:21.567 --> 03:03:23.868]  And now they're launching the ball.
[03:03:23.868 --> 03:03:25.348]  Yesterday they released the ball.
[03:03:25.348 --> 03:03:27.209]  I mean, they're definitely going for it.
[03:03:32.455 --> 03:03:39.260]  Well, if I was a Fed and could take off the next few months and had hours built up or retirement built up, I'd get the hell out of there.
[03:03:39.260 --> 03:03:43.583]  I mean, I mean, tell you, because I know the number one target of the of the globalist.
[03:03:43.583 --> 03:03:50.027]  And if you see suspicious people getting out of a Ryder truck in front of your building, you better you better hit the ground fast.
[03:03:52.830 --> 03:03:58.472]  So what I've laid out is that I'm now, every point, and I've laid this out on record.
[03:03:58.472 --> 03:04:01.253]  If this happens, and then they do this, and then they do that, look out.
[03:04:01.253 --> 03:04:06.995]  And the exact pattern is now, all the green lights are going, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, launch, launch.
[03:04:06.995 --> 03:04:10.337]  They're turning the keys to run the operation.
[03:04:10.337 --> 03:04:16.379]  And I'm on air telling you, ladies and gentlemen, state takes extra steps to battle
[03:04:17.338 --> 03:04:25.624]  The flu in the fall deputizes citizens and others to help with vaccinations for forced inoculations, Boston Globe.
[03:04:25.624 --> 03:04:31.809]  And then I've got... Where was my incredible headline I had during the break?
[03:04:31.809 --> 03:04:36.413]  Did I run out with that article about the... Oh, here it is.
[03:04:36.413 --> 03:04:40.876]  National Guard drill at high school prepared for possible H1N1 riot.
[03:04:40.876 --> 03:04:44.178]  National Guard takes over school in swine flu riot drill.
[03:04:44.178 --> 03:04:45.279]  That's the Sun Journal.
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:52.407]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:04:52.407 --> 03:04:52.947]  Number one,
[03:05:07.142 --> 03:05:10.385]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:10.385 --> 03:05:11.065]  Number 2.
[03:05:11.065 --> 03:05:16.289]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:16.289 --> 03:05:16.930]  It's true.
[03:05:16.930 --> 03:05:21.353]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.353 --> 03:05:22.274]  Number 3.
[03:05:22.274 --> 03:05:27.899]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:05:27.899 --> 03:05:28.559]  Number 4.
[03:05:28.559 --> 03:05:31.462]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:05:31.462 --> 03:05:35.124]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:35.124 --> 03:05:35.365]  Number 5.
[03:05:35.965 --> 03:05:39.826]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:05:39.826 --> 03:05:45.548]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[03:06:01.462 --> 03:06:04.464]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.464 --> 03:06:09.809]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.809 --> 03:06:11.850]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.850 --> 03:06:16.854]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.854 --> 03:06:17.775]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.015 --> 03:06:19.156]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.156 --> 03:06:21.038]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.038 --> 03:06:22.118]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.118 --> 03:06:24.300]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.300 --> 03:06:25.641]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.641 --> 03:06:27.183]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.183 --> 03:06:32.447]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.447 --> 03:06:36.030]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.030 --> 03:06:39.513]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.853 --> 03:06:41.073]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.073 --> 03:06:41.974]  We don't know.
[03:06:41.974 --> 03:06:43.074]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.074 --> 03:06:44.014]  All you can get.
[03:06:44.014 --> 03:06:45.094]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.094 --> 03:06:48.155]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:48.155 --> 03:06:49.936]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:49.936 --> 03:06:50.836]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:00.879 --> 03:07:09.690]  You know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[03:07:09.690 --> 03:07:17.699]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[03:07:18.220 --> 03:07:22.423]  And clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[03:07:22.423 --> 03:07:25.205]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[03:07:25.205 --> 03:07:36.774]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[03:07:36.774 --> 03:07:43.199]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[03:07:43.199 --> 03:07:46.942]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[03:07:47.022 --> 03:07:47.322]  Big Brother.
[03:08:07.583 --> 03:08:09.344]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.344 --> 03:08:11.105]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.105 --> 03:08:12.685]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.685 --> 03:08:14.266]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.266 --> 03:08:18.428]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.428 --> 03:08:22.490]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.951 --> 03:08:26.994]  You know, Steve Quayle might be right.
[03:08:26.994 --> 03:08:28.075]  This may be it.
[03:08:28.075 --> 03:08:30.377]  We're going away in Madison in one moment.
[03:08:30.377 --> 03:08:33.580]  We've got the congressman coming on either tomorrow or sometime next week.
[03:08:33.580 --> 03:08:34.661]  He's on the road right now.
[03:08:34.661 --> 03:08:36.382]  He's been on the show before.
[03:08:36.382 --> 03:08:41.086]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law and it says
[03:08:42.878 --> 03:08:55.847]  Georgia Congressman Paul Brown warned attendees of a town hall event Tuesday that the Obama administration was planning to use a pandemic or a national disaster to implement martial law in the United States.
[03:08:55.847 --> 03:09:09.196]  Speaking at the North Georgia Technical College Auditorium, Brown said the socialistic elite, as well as Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, were planning to exploit the crisis to create a favorable climate for their stalling political agenda.
[03:09:09.196 --> 03:09:11.298]  Exactly what we've been telling you!
[03:09:13.322 --> 03:09:16.210]  They're trying to develop an environment where they can take over, he said.
[03:09:16.210 --> 03:09:17.634]  We've seen that historically.
[03:09:17.634 --> 03:09:20.362]  And notice there's really seamless integration between Bush...
[03:09:21.454 --> 03:09:22.055]  And Obama.
[03:09:22.055 --> 03:09:23.576]  And I remember him saying this six months ago.
[03:09:23.576 --> 03:09:25.197]  Now it's hit mainstream news.
[03:09:25.197 --> 03:09:30.281]  Wayne Madsen's talked about the first time ever in 233 years of U.S.
[03:09:30.281 --> 03:09:37.928]  history, Cheney left a stay-behind network, like NATO did when the Soviets took over.
[03:09:37.928 --> 03:09:40.730]  It's really still Cheney and Bush running things.
[03:09:40.730 --> 03:09:43.552]  I heard Madsen say that six months ago and kind of, huh?
[03:09:43.552 --> 03:09:45.173]  But now I've analyzed it.
[03:09:45.173 --> 03:09:46.254]  It's true!
[03:09:46.254 --> 03:09:49.317]  And these Obama idiots have no idea what they're dealing with.
[03:09:52.346 --> 03:09:54.967]  They're trying to develop an environment where they can take over, he said.
[03:09:54.967 --> 03:09:56.648]  We've seen that historically.
[03:09:56.648 --> 03:10:08.375]  Brown's warning arrives on the backs of a letter sent to the National Governors Association to the Pentagon last week, which condemns the military's plans to usurp domestic control of National Guard and federal forces deployed in the event of a natural disaster or terror attack.
[03:10:10.131 --> 03:10:31.329]  And then it goes into Brigades Homeland, and now they say they're going to pull triggers on the American people, and suddenly regular Federal Army, regular Federal Marines running checkpoints from Tennessee to California, from Texas to Florida, and then I've got this, and we're getting calls from Southeast Texas in Beaumont at Lamar University, and I confirmed there is some drill going on there.
[03:10:31.329 --> 03:10:32.029]  I confirmed
[03:10:32.910 --> 03:10:35.712]  Paul Watson confirmed, got an article up, we've confirmed.
[03:10:35.712 --> 03:10:40.336]  National Guard drill at high school to prepare for possible H1N1 riot.
[03:10:40.336 --> 03:10:41.497]  But see, they do this.
[03:10:41.497 --> 03:10:45.020]  I know what they're going to do because I've been to their drills.
[03:10:45.020 --> 03:10:49.423]  It's like I know the sun's coming up at 6.15 because I know when the sun comes up.
[03:10:49.423 --> 03:10:50.924]  I'm not smart.
[03:10:50.924 --> 03:10:52.365]  I went to drill after drill.
[03:10:53.567 --> 03:11:00.049]  In the last 12 years and made three films and they always stage it like people want in the camp and people want the shot.
[03:11:00.049 --> 03:11:03.470]  So the troops think, oh, putting people in camps is good, they want to be here.
[03:11:03.470 --> 03:11:08.491]  Then later in the drills, in the second or third drill they do, then the people fight back.
[03:11:08.491 --> 03:11:10.812]  See, it's all meant to sell cops, it's good.
[03:11:10.812 --> 03:11:11.932]  Sell military, it's good.
[03:11:11.932 --> 03:11:14.753]  It's all written by psych warfare experts.
[03:11:15.715 --> 03:11:21.129]  Oxfords Hill Comprehensive High School will be the site of a National Guard riot control drill Thursday.
[03:11:21.129 --> 03:11:22.011]  That's today!
[03:11:22.011 --> 03:11:23.274]  Get over there!
[03:11:23.274 --> 03:11:24.016]  Get over there!
[03:11:25.558 --> 03:11:37.928]  To prepare for the event of panic over distribution of serum to treat the swine flu, the school on Route 26 in Paris, Norway town, Lies, has been designated by the state officials as the distribution site for H1N1 flu vaccine.
[03:11:37.928 --> 03:11:44.814]  The drill is prepared for a worst-case scenario should the serum have to be transported from Augusta and people rush to get it.
[03:11:44.814 --> 03:11:45.995]  See, they did drills in Austin.
[03:11:46.195 --> 03:11:58.446]  Remember, in January, we had the emergency manager on in Indiana, where they were wanting to know where to bury millions of dead from Chicago, across the state line, and said, harden the police stations, get ready for martial law, and that's when I started saying, they're gonna use the flu!
[03:11:58.446 --> 03:11:59.987]  It's the flu, it's the flu!
[03:11:59.987 --> 03:12:06.053]  And then I got secret documents from the state of New York, we posted with numbers, later came out mainstream news, they were real.
[03:12:06.053 --> 03:12:06.994]  We have the sources!
[03:12:08.223 --> 03:12:11.485]  I gotta get more people hired in here because we can't even go through all these documents now.
[03:12:11.485 --> 03:12:12.806]  It's just like piles of it.
[03:12:12.806 --> 03:12:15.308]  You couldn't believe how dire the situation is.
[03:12:15.308 --> 03:12:22.774]  Getting ready for millions dead in New York for something that's killed a few thousand and it's peak pandemic in the other hemisphere right now?
[03:12:22.774 --> 03:12:23.895]  Something that's nothing?
[03:12:23.895 --> 03:12:25.296]  What are they planning?
[03:12:25.296 --> 03:12:26.377]  What is going on?
[03:12:29.687 --> 03:12:46.693]  But it's just like Y2K, the Feds used that to build emergency FEMA bunkers everywhere, take over local government, put in their new computer systems, put in their new camera systems, they hyped it, the Navy said it was the end of the world, and then they turned around and said that the people had made it up, it was no big deal, when it was the government that said it was real.
[03:12:46.693 --> 03:12:56.197]  Same thing here, well they just say, oh, we ordered 20 billion in vaccines, and you took it, and some people died from it, but, you know, and the Feds have trained you how to, is that all that's happening, or is it bigger?
[03:12:56.957 --> 03:12:59.419]  So we're going to go over more of this, but I want to go ahead and go to Wayne Madsen.
[03:12:59.419 --> 03:13:02.721]  He's with us for the remaining 47 minutes.
[03:13:02.721 --> 03:13:05.863]  Wayne, thank you for coming on WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:13:05.863 --> 03:13:09.165]  You've heard me ranting through all of this.
[03:13:09.165 --> 03:13:13.287]  We've got major German newspapers reporting there's live cancer virus in it.
[03:13:13.287 --> 03:13:15.368]  Top scientists saying don't take it.
[03:13:15.368 --> 03:13:17.710]  Other bird flu trials are killing people en masse.
[03:13:17.710 --> 03:13:18.851]  London Telegraph.
[03:13:18.851 --> 03:13:21.432]  What on earth is going on here?
[03:13:21.432 --> 03:13:23.513]  Well, let me make you feel even better.
[03:13:23.513 --> 03:13:25.795]  Next week in Washington there's a conference
[03:13:26.357 --> 03:13:31.800]  I believe you had something posted about this on your website, but it's on swine flu.
[03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:35.302]  It's at the Capitol Hill Hyatt Hotel.
[03:13:35.302 --> 03:13:37.804]  And here's some of the breakout sessions.
[03:13:37.804 --> 03:13:41.206]  Mass fatality management planning.
[03:13:41.206 --> 03:13:42.786]  Direct fatality management.
[03:13:42.786 --> 03:13:44.567]  Tactical operations.
[03:13:44.567 --> 03:13:46.168]  Conduct morgue operations.
[03:13:46.168 --> 03:13:47.809]  Conduct final disposition.
[03:13:47.809 --> 03:13:49.090]  That's a body.
[03:13:49.090 --> 03:13:50.571]  And manage... I can't figure...
[03:13:51.031 --> 03:13:52.753]  Manage anti-mortem data.
[03:13:52.753 --> 03:13:54.514]  Now, I know what post-mortem data is.
[03:13:54.514 --> 03:13:59.198]  That's how many people would have died, but what in the world is anti-mortem data?
[03:13:59.198 --> 03:14:04.582]  I mean, are they figuring out beforehand how many people may die?
[03:14:04.582 --> 03:14:08.986]  And, you know, they have a self-fulfilling wish there.
[03:14:08.986 --> 03:14:10.267]  Psychological issues.
[03:14:10.267 --> 03:14:11.668]  You talked about psyops.
[03:14:11.668 --> 03:14:13.850]  Public's distress of exposure and safety.
[03:14:13.850 --> 03:14:15.892]  Breakdown of public services utilities.
[03:14:16.372 --> 03:14:19.053]  I'm willingness to follow government orders.
[03:14:19.053 --> 03:14:28.638]  Now this is obviously being held on Capitol Hill, at the Hill, because they want to get members of Congress, especially their staffers, to go to this thing.
[03:14:28.638 --> 03:14:36.802]  But this is what they're talking about, continuity of operations planning, disruptions to public, private, and critical infrastructure, undermining essential functions.
[03:14:37.583 --> 03:14:38.544]  So there you have it.
[03:14:38.544 --> 03:14:39.965]  This is what they're talking about.
[03:14:39.965 --> 03:14:48.994]  They're talking about when H1N1 flu pandemic is unfolding, two or three successive waves in a calendar year.
[03:14:48.994 --> 03:14:54.880]  So we're talking about October as, you know, sort of ground zero, at least in North America.
[03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:56.982]  October into April.
[03:14:56.982 --> 03:14:57.583]  Right, right.
[03:14:59.606 --> 03:15:03.429]  So this is what they're talking about, and this is next week in Washington.
[03:15:03.429 --> 03:15:05.130]  I'm going to try to cover this.
[03:15:05.130 --> 03:15:18.622]  They want almost $2,000 to deregister normally, but hopefully they're going to let press in there to cover what they're talking about, because there's a lot of government people, people from the World Health Organization, people from the U.S.
[03:15:18.622 --> 03:15:20.904]  government, all scheduled to speak at this thing.
[03:15:22.569 --> 03:15:36.663]  Unbelievable, and they put that big price tag on there to make it cost prohibitive for most journalists, but you're with an international TV network and write for major publications, so they should let you in for free, just as press, but we certainly want to have you here reporting for us, Wayne.
[03:15:36.663 --> 03:15:41.628]  Wayne, you heard me rant through, as you were on hold for five minutes, all the different little tidbits.
[03:15:41.628 --> 03:15:43.930]  Congressmen saying it's a cover for martial law.
[03:15:44.671 --> 03:15:47.993]  Open announcements they're going to forcibly inoculate in lockdown cities.
[03:15:47.993 --> 03:15:55.458]  Now that doesn't mean they're going to get away with this, but they're certainly now saying they're going to do this, and that's what level six rules mean.
[03:15:55.458 --> 03:15:59.121]  That's what the executive order now activated means.
[03:15:59.121 --> 03:16:05.005]  What is your... I know you are up at Capitol Hill, I know you're at the Press Club, I know you have sources.
[03:16:05.005 --> 03:16:07.367]  I've really come to respect and be impressed
[03:16:08.127 --> 03:16:12.775]  You're one of our best sources, Wayne, and I've really not seen you be wrong yet, which is scaring me.
[03:16:12.775 --> 03:16:16.520]  You, day one, said you had virologists that were saying it was manufactured.
[03:16:16.520 --> 03:16:18.944]  That got seconded months later.
[03:16:18.944 --> 03:16:20.326]  What is going on with this flu?
[03:16:20.326 --> 03:16:22.991]  Is it really going to kill a bunch of people, or is it...
[03:16:23.471 --> 03:16:27.995]  The excuse to bring in tyranny, is that a beta test of tyranny?
[03:16:27.995 --> 03:16:28.856]  Or is it a test?
[03:16:28.856 --> 03:16:30.437]  Do they think they'll get away with it?
[03:16:30.437 --> 03:16:35.722]  Will they go over with total control as a smokescreen for the collapsing economy?
[03:16:35.722 --> 03:16:40.005]  And use it to pass the cap and trade and the banker bailout too?
[03:16:40.005 --> 03:16:41.887]  I mean, what's going on with this?
[03:16:42.429 --> 03:16:47.051]  Well, there's two protocols that seem to be in place in reporting now.
[03:16:47.051 --> 03:16:49.032]  First, we heard about people being infected.
[03:16:49.032 --> 03:16:55.395]  We got those, you know, Brazil's been hit, and then it was Panama, then it was India.
[03:16:55.395 --> 03:16:58.177]  Now we're hearing about deaths from all these various countries.
[03:16:58.177 --> 03:17:01.038]  You know, first death in Nicaragua.
[03:17:01.038 --> 03:17:10.883]  But one thing they talk about is how most, if not all, these people died because they already had a pre-existing condition.
[03:17:11.483 --> 03:17:23.232]  I'm hearing from people in the medical community that that is actually not the case for the most part, that these people walk in healthy, and in some cases, you know, a few days later they're dead.
[03:17:23.232 --> 03:17:25.554]  The other thing is undercounting the number of deaths.
[03:17:25.554 --> 03:17:30.097]  I understand from a source in Jakarta, Indonesia, which has now been hit by a
[03:17:31.638 --> 03:17:36.320]  H1N1, that the government there is actually undercounting the number of deaths.
[03:17:36.320 --> 03:17:44.643]  Yeah, the state of Texas document I got saying, we tell the public we're at level 4, we're really at level 5, in 96 hours we go to level 6.
[03:17:44.643 --> 03:17:46.103]  That was in April.
[03:17:46.103 --> 03:17:50.205]  Turned out that that was an accurate document, at least for being level 6.
[03:17:50.205 --> 03:17:52.465]  They said the deaths were much higher.
[03:17:52.465 --> 03:17:54.166]  So, continue.
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:18:00.726]  Well, I mean, and you know this conference next week, here's what they're going to talk about when it comes to law enforcement.
[03:18:00.726 --> 03:18:06.993]  They're going to talk about controlling and diffusing social unrest and public disorder with this swine flu.
[03:18:06.993 --> 03:18:12.239]  So it's clear that they know what's coming down the pike unless the people putting this on.
[03:18:12.799 --> 03:18:13.419]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:18:13.419 --> 03:18:15.340]  This is all a getting all the ducks in a row operation.
[03:18:41.494 --> 03:18:43.197]  Right.
[03:18:43.197 --> 03:18:51.031]  Anything on Pennsylvania Avenue, as is this conference planner, if it's on Pennsylvania Avenue, that's pretty high rent, so somebody's putting a bill.
[03:18:52.006 --> 03:18:55.429]  Yeah, so we got them all getting their little minions.
[03:18:55.429 --> 03:19:01.775]  A, how to line up at the Sal's breast, and B, what talking points to cover.
[03:19:01.775 --> 03:19:03.857]  So they're getting their ducks in a row.
[03:19:03.857 --> 03:19:09.603]  But what about the mass graves they're getting ready and the forced inoculations?
[03:19:09.603 --> 03:19:13.106]  Clearly this is a federalization drill, but not just federalization.
[03:19:13.106 --> 03:19:15.789]  All over the world, it's the UN directing this.
[03:19:17.168 --> 03:19:20.771]  Well, again, I mean, you know, you look at what they're going to be talking about here.
[03:19:20.771 --> 03:19:24.813]  They're talking about enforcing quarantine.
[03:19:24.813 --> 03:19:36.642]  You know, so it's clear they're talking about, you know, airlines, restrictions on travel, restrictions at airports, border crossings.
[03:19:36.642 --> 03:19:40.164]  This is all, and then how to handle medical waste.
[03:19:40.164 --> 03:19:44.627]  I assume that includes probably dead bodies.
[03:19:44.627 --> 03:19:46.028]  You know, people have died from this.
[03:19:47.169 --> 03:19:49.091]  Wayne, we got a break.
[03:19:49.091 --> 03:19:59.643]  When we come back, in the last two weeks that came out, they're hiring tens of thousands of additional internment and resettlement re-education officers.
[03:19:59.643 --> 03:20:00.544]  I want to get your take on that.
[03:20:01.772 --> 03:20:03.072]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:03.072 --> 03:20:08.654]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.654 --> 03:20:13.675]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.675 --> 03:20:19.257]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:20:19.257 --> 03:20:23.938]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:24.458 --> 03:20:31.580]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.580 --> 03:20:32.700]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.700 --> 03:20:39.402]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:39.402 --> 03:20:42.582]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:20:42.582 --> 03:20:44.803]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:20:44.803 --> 03:20:45.723]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:20:49.384 --> 03:20:53.609]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:20:53.609 --> 03:20:58.455]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:20:58.455 --> 03:21:00.818]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:21:03.513 --> 03:21:04.955]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:04.955 --> 03:21:11.022]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:21:11.022 --> 03:21:11.843]  That's right.
[03:21:11.843 --> 03:21:14.687]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:21:14.687 --> 03:21:21.615]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:21:22.156 --> 03:21:30.308]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:21:30.308 --> 03:21:35.795]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:21:35.795 --> 03:21:38.199]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement,
[03:21:38.539 --> 03:21:41.582]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:41.582 --> 03:21:46.106]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:21:46.106 --> 03:21:46.386]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:46.386 --> 03:21:48.368]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[03:21:48.368 --> 03:21:48.969]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:48.969 --> 03:21:49.229]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:02.242 --> 03:22:08.268]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:22:08.268 --> 03:22:14.154]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:22:14.154 --> 03:22:20.320]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:22:20.660 --> 03:22:22.603]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:22:22.603 --> 03:22:25.087]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:22:25.087 --> 03:22:36.003]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:22:38.254 --> 03:22:39.935]  It's not about left or right.
[03:22:39.935 --> 03:22:41.776]  It's about a one world government.
[03:22:41.776 --> 03:22:48.700]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:22:48.700 --> 03:22:56.964]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:56.964 --> 03:22:58.525]  The Obama Deception.
[03:22:58.525 --> 03:22:59.706]  The people strike back.
[03:23:01.305 --> 03:23:05.829]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:23:05.829 --> 03:23:08.250]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:23:08.250 --> 03:23:17.858]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:23:18.078 --> 03:23:18.398]  We're good.
[03:23:37.094 --> 03:23:47.638]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[03:23:47.638 --> 03:23:51.679]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[03:23:51.679 --> 03:23:54.661]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:23:54.661 --> 03:23:58.442]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[03:23:58.442 --> 03:24:00.923]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:24:06.318 --> 03:24:28.253]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're just addressing what the congressmen are saying about him using it for martial law.
[03:24:28.253 --> 03:24:32.936]  The forced inoculations, the mass graves were vindicated, proven right again.
[03:24:34.264 --> 03:24:41.246]  And if people would just stop denying the documents we bring forward, we would have even more political steam now to defeat this.
[03:24:41.246 --> 03:24:45.267]  If people would just check into the claims we make, we source everything.
[03:24:45.267 --> 03:24:53.969]  Instead of listening to COINTELPRO and the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center and all of them lying about us.
[03:24:53.969 --> 03:24:58.550]  There's an article up there where they're talking about how I need to be killed.
[03:24:58.550 --> 03:25:00.991]  I mean, it's really getting creepy.
[03:25:02.350 --> 03:25:04.292]  Uh, so that's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:25:04.292 --> 03:25:04.972]  We have links to them.
[03:25:04.972 --> 03:25:06.093]  These guys are bold.
[03:25:06.093 --> 03:25:07.254]  They do not like us.
[03:25:07.254 --> 03:25:10.037]  They're very upset we're raining on their parade.
[03:25:10.037 --> 03:25:10.977]  Okay, Wayne Madsen.
[03:25:10.977 --> 03:25:12.378]  I want to get into the whole Barther thing.
[03:25:12.378 --> 03:25:14.640]  You've got some inside intel on that.
[03:25:14.640 --> 03:25:18.924]  But, first off, WayneMadsenReport.com, again, is his website.
[03:25:22.785 --> 03:25:37.567]  I was bringing up the issue of the internment, relocation, re-education specialist, and people are finally waking up because it's on the Army's own website that, oh, we need jail guards for America for the Army to put whole towns in.
[03:25:37.567 --> 03:25:37.887]  Go ahead.
[03:25:39.082 --> 03:25:55.174]  Well, I mean, look, you know, you look at what Vice President Biden said as far as, you know, when he's talking about this bailout package, uh, uh, the first thing he said, the first priority was to, uh, uh, provide more funding for, uh, funding for law enforcement agencies, for the police around the country.
[03:25:55.174 --> 03:25:58.116]  I mean, like, we don't have enough of them.
[03:25:58.116 --> 03:25:58.736]  Uh, so it's clear.
[03:25:59.637 --> 03:26:08.965]  It's clear that this administration is putting as much emphasis on all this domestic security nonsense as did the last one.
[03:26:08.965 --> 03:26:20.294]  And, you know, there's people out there that are really hurting, and all Biden can talk about is providing this bailout, you know, this incentive money for cops.
[03:26:20.294 --> 03:26:23.957]  And I don't think they need any more money.
[03:26:23.957 --> 03:26:26.479]  What, we've had a quadrupling in police the last 15 years?
[03:26:28.224 --> 03:26:32.207]  Yeah, I just noticed that at the local Dunkin Donuts.
[03:26:32.207 --> 03:26:38.952]  There now seems to be four times as many cop cars sitting there while they're on break than there was before.
[03:26:38.952 --> 03:26:42.735]  But then you can't get one when your house gets broken into most of the time.
[03:26:42.735 --> 03:26:44.717]  But boy, they're there with radar guns though.
[03:26:45.282 --> 03:27:00.708]  Well, actually, well, they have to raise revenue for these state and county and municipal governments because the tax base is collapsing, so that's how they're, you know, they have to shake down the public to earn their keep.
[03:27:00.708 --> 03:27:13.173]  Well, Wayne, how do you see this unfolding, that you can go to the Army's own website, and that's actually off of a Hispanic job site,
[03:27:14.322 --> 03:27:33.390]  uh... one of the links you put in internment specialist army or just national guard internment special you got your national guard dot that matter will show folks that's good enough i mean they're really gearing up at the new economy is the police state the new what i mean that all the major new grants and
[03:27:34.275 --> 03:27:35.876]  Scholarships are for this.
[03:27:35.876 --> 03:27:43.642]  Just everything's converting to private security firms and prisons and cameras owned by a few government cronies.
[03:27:43.642 --> 03:27:51.168]  I mean, I guess the government's not happy to just ship in the heroin and cocaine and put all our kids in prison and rape us and steal all our money.
[03:27:51.168 --> 03:27:54.011]  I mean, now they've got to just totally make everything a big prison.
[03:27:55.205 --> 03:28:03.452]  Well, it looks that way to me, especially with, you know, this agenda that I'm looking at here for this conference next week.
[03:28:03.452 --> 03:28:06.735]  It'll just be interesting to see who from the government is there.
[03:28:06.735 --> 03:28:22.428]  Even if I can't get in, I'm going to be hanging around the hotel lobby to just check those name tags, because one thing about this town is they have a tendency to issue name tags for these conferences, and of course, you look under the name and you can often spot what agency they're with.
[03:28:23.254 --> 03:28:24.256]  Well, what?
[03:28:24.256 --> 03:28:29.144]  I mean, I know you're there at the press club talking to all these other reporters and talking to intelligence people.
[03:28:29.144 --> 03:28:31.027]  What's the skinny on what's coming in the fall?
[03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:37.594]  Well, the anticipation, there's actually a few threads going right now.
[03:28:37.594 --> 03:28:56.870]  There's this fear that we're going to see a surge here in North America with the swine flu, but also there's talk about the end of September, of course, is the end of the fiscal year, and with the beginning of the new fiscal year, October the 1st, I'm hearing
[03:28:57.290 --> 03:29:05.055]  Rumors about the economy may not recover when the commercial real estate market collapses on top of a private housing market.
[03:29:05.055 --> 03:29:09.497]  We may see more banks go under, and there's talk about potentially a bank holiday.
[03:29:09.497 --> 03:29:17.582]  How long it's going to last, I don't know, but just bank closures, you know, in order for the executive branch to close banks across the country.
[03:29:17.582 --> 03:29:19.403]  It happened during the Depression.
[03:29:19.403 --> 03:29:22.345]  Franklin Roosevelt did it, and I'm hearing that it may happen again.
[03:29:25.506 --> 03:29:27.307]  When we come back, I found it.
[03:29:27.307 --> 03:29:33.250]  If you just Google internment specialist by itself, the first link is GoArmy.com.
[03:29:33.250 --> 03:29:34.151]  People may have heard of it.
[03:29:34.151 --> 03:29:35.412]  It's called the U.S.
[03:29:35.412 --> 03:29:35.652]  Army.
[03:29:35.652 --> 03:29:38.333]  It's the biggest military in the world.
[03:29:38.333 --> 03:29:40.174]  I assure you it exists.
[03:29:40.174 --> 03:29:42.376]  GoArmy.com.
[03:29:42.376 --> 03:29:49.240]  Now, I know popular science will say the Army doesn't exist next and there's no FEMA camps, but it's all over the news.
[03:29:49.240 --> 03:29:51.661]  There it is.
[03:29:51.661 --> 03:29:53.042]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.042 --> 03:29:54.563]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.567 --> 03:30:01.010]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.010 --> 03:30:05.252]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.252 --> 03:30:07.253]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.253 --> 03:30:15.777]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.777 --> 03:30:21.319]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.319 --> 03:30:22.940]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.180 --> 03:30:29.702]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.702 --> 03:30:40.744]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.744 --> 03:30:41.505]  That's right.
[03:30:41.505 --> 03:30:44.085]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:30:44.085 --> 03:30:45.666]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[03:30:48.247 --> 03:31:06.201]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:31:06.201 --> 03:31:10.724]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:31:10.724 --> 03:31:13.006]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:31:13.006 --> 03:31:14.627]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:31:14.627 --> 03:31:15.668]  There is a solution.
[03:31:15.888 --> 03:31:24.312]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:31:37.797 --> 03:31:43.822]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[03:32:01.189 --> 03:32:04.250]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:32:04.250 --> 03:32:09.753]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:32:09.753 --> 03:32:15.496]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:32:15.496 --> 03:32:16.957]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:32:16.957 --> 03:32:25.861]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:32:26.281 --> 03:32:28.123]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[03:32:28.123 --> 03:32:32.327]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[03:33:11.718 --> 03:33:15.201]  ...specialty, internment resettlement specialist.
[03:33:15.201 --> 03:33:22.287]  This MOS plays an integral role in providing a uniform system of handling prisoners and detainees.
[03:33:22.287 --> 03:33:27.672]  First and always, these MPs are combat support soldiers, trained to fight.
[03:33:27.672 --> 03:33:38.861]  Then, also trained as internment resettlement specialists, to control and supervise detainees, to ensure their humane treatment, and to assist them in returning to a productive life.
[03:33:39.782 --> 03:33:50.206]  For this job, the Army will train you to use specialized equipment to monitor activity, to conduct searches, and to inspect areas where prisoners work and live.
[03:33:50.206 --> 03:33:55.828]  Here, you'll train to in-process prisoners and detainees, and to brief them on their rights.
[03:33:56.628 --> 03:34:05.631]  In addition, you'll train to inventory and secure their property, take photographs and fingerprints, issue personal items, and assign cells.
[03:34:05.631 --> 03:34:16.855]  You'll train to conduct prisoner formations and roll calls, to monitor their exercise, recreation, and work areas, to prepare and maintain records, and develop written reports.
[03:34:17.695 --> 03:34:34.280]  After your initial entry training and advanced individual training, you'll work long hours, day or night, in a garrison or field environment, where you may practice emergency procedures, detect and confiscate contraband, and escort prisoners outside the facility.
[03:34:34.280 --> 03:34:39.622]  Serving in this MOS can help you transition from the military to the civilian employment sector.
[03:34:39.622 --> 03:34:40.522]  Alright, that's enough!
[03:34:40.522 --> 03:34:42.363]  In the Military Police Corps, you'll be...
[03:34:42.463 --> 03:34:46.165]  Now again, this all has dual use, but I've been to the training ops.
[03:34:46.165 --> 03:34:47.566]  It is for American citizens.
[03:34:47.566 --> 03:34:53.130]  And you notice, escorting you outside the base, they have the civilian inmate labor camp program.
[03:34:53.130 --> 03:34:55.331]  Secret from 86 to 97.
[03:34:55.331 --> 03:34:57.232]  Clinton made it declassified.
[03:34:57.232 --> 03:35:01.055]  Secret that American citizens were used as slave labor at bases.
[03:35:01.055 --> 03:35:04.377]  Here, let's just Google civilian inmate labor camp program for everybody.
[03:35:04.377 --> 03:35:06.258]  You know, for those out there in denial.
[03:35:07.199 --> 03:35:09.043]  This has been going on.
[03:35:09.043 --> 03:35:15.197]  Does that creep you out, Wayne, that they could keep these camps with citizens on them, secret, for a decade?
[03:35:15.777 --> 03:35:24.462]  Well, I mean, this whole issue of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, you know, FEMA has never operated in a very transparent mode.
[03:35:24.462 --> 03:35:37.628]  Even back in Reagan years, they called FEMA the secret government, and there's a lot of truth to it, because they have these facilities around the country.
[03:35:37.628 --> 03:35:40.530]  You're not allowed to go on these facilities.
[03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:50.778]  See what's happening, but you know, the reports are there about the number of these large detention centers that have been built up around the country.
[03:35:50.778 --> 03:35:57.263]  I remember the first time I heard about this was somebody in Kern County, California.
[03:35:57.263 --> 03:36:01.626]  He started, you know, on his way to work every morning, noticed this camp was getting larger and larger.
[03:36:01.626 --> 03:36:02.667]  There was nobody in it yet.
[03:36:03.167 --> 03:36:06.589]  And just to be clear, I have the 2005 on screen right now.
[03:36:06.589 --> 03:36:08.230]  We'll keep scrolling through that.
[03:36:32.509 --> 03:36:37.973]  You've got these back to 1986 declassified so you find out more in each one.
[03:36:37.973 --> 03:36:52.402]  The 1997 declassification admitted that they kept federal prisoners at these and brought them as slaves and the army ran them as slaves and then would pimp them out for slave labor around towns.
[03:36:52.402 --> 03:36:54.163]  So this is the new America.
[03:36:54.163 --> 03:37:02.289]  Our new job is having an illegal alien who is in the military, that's our new force, commanding a citizen around who had a crooked toenail or something.
[03:37:03.130 --> 03:37:10.282]  I mean, I have articles right here where school teachers are given $22,000 fines for using a cell phone in class.
[03:37:10.282 --> 03:37:11.784]  See, we're all prisoners now.
[03:37:13.376 --> 03:37:14.677]  Wayne Madsen.
[03:37:14.677 --> 03:37:17.678]  Well, I don't see it getting any better.
[03:37:17.678 --> 03:37:26.963]  I mean, the people I know who voted for Obama and thought there was going to be a change, I hear the term buyer's remorse quite a bit.
[03:37:26.963 --> 03:37:31.146]  I know people who were candidates for president are hearing the same thing.
[03:37:31.146 --> 03:37:34.687]  So, I mean, where's the change?
[03:37:34.687 --> 03:37:35.308]  I don't see much.
[03:37:36.328 --> 03:37:36.809]  I agree.
[03:37:36.809 --> 03:37:56.162]  I want to show people from General Shoemaker's 2005 document, Civilian Inmate Labor Programs, right here on screen, providing a source of labor at no direct cost to army installations to accomplish tasks that would not be possible otherwise, due to the manning and funding constraints under which the army operates.
[03:37:56.162 --> 03:37:58.644]  Slave labor!
[03:37:58.644 --> 03:38:01.406]  These are not guys that punch their drill instructor in the nose.
[03:38:01.406 --> 03:38:03.648]  These are state and federal prisoners.
[03:38:03.648 --> 03:38:04.989]  And this is going to be you and your family.
[03:38:06.628 --> 03:38:08.089]  Sorry, Wayne, go ahead.
[03:38:08.089 --> 03:38:20.695]  Well, I mean, of course we're now hearing about Blackwater and these revelations made by these two former Blackwater employees about what was going on at the camps in Iraq that they were running.
[03:38:20.695 --> 03:38:22.776]  I've got to stop you.
[03:38:22.776 --> 03:38:24.177]  Hold on, Wayne, I'm glad you brought that up.
[03:38:24.177 --> 03:38:26.318]  Take your time, then we're going to get into the whole Bertha thing.
[03:38:26.318 --> 03:38:28.239]  Let me stop right there.
[03:38:28.239 --> 03:38:31.861]  Start over, because you have a lot of sources.
[03:38:31.861 --> 03:38:33.482]  Time Magazine, for those that don't know.
[03:38:35.953 --> 03:38:51.376]  The nation and Raw Story and others have big reports that the FBI is saying this, it's in the federal documents, that Blackwater was A. Killing its own employees to cover up, arms dealing, and that's what you had said that they and others, well you'd said Merck's had been caught.
[03:38:51.957 --> 03:38:55.960]  Actually, Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst for Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:39:06.008]  said that Mercs, he wouldn't say who, were caught bringing weapons in and actually staging attacks on the troops because it's a trillion dollar war, you gotta keep it going and have an excuse to stay there.
[03:39:06.008 --> 03:39:18.457]  So, A, go through the Blackwater revelations, the slave children they're raping, the wife swapping, the murders, whether your intel is how bad it is, but the key here that the media just mentioned as a footnote
[03:39:19.358 --> 03:39:22.619]  Who were they smuggling arms to in Iraq?
[03:39:22.619 --> 03:39:24.279]  Wayne Madsen.
[03:39:24.279 --> 03:39:38.602]  Well, they were smuggling weapons that were winding up in the hands of the Kurds, and it's thought from the Kurds they wound up in the hands of the PKK, an organization that Turkey considers to be a terrorist organization.
[03:39:38.602 --> 03:39:42.463]  An organization that the United States considers to be a terrorist organization.
[03:39:42.463 --> 03:39:43.603]  So this is all this
[03:39:44.045 --> 03:39:50.731]  You know, keeping this part of the world at each other's throats, you know, killing each other, there's profit in that.
[03:39:50.731 --> 03:40:00.219]  And companies like Blackwater and other companies, there's hundreds of them like Blackwater, they're one of the big ones, are all involved in the same business.
[03:40:00.219 --> 03:40:02.120]  It's War Incorporated.
[03:40:02.120 --> 03:40:03.181]  And the U.S.
[03:40:03.181 --> 03:40:05.303]  is trying to get extradited from Thailand.
[03:40:05.303 --> 03:40:09.567]  There's a Russian named Viktor But who they're accused of being the merchant of death.
[03:40:09.567 --> 03:40:11.829]  But we've got a few of them over here too.
[03:40:12.969 --> 03:40:22.052]  I wonder what would happen if somebody asked for the extradition of Eric Prince, the CEO of Blackwater, now called V. They changed her name to protect the guilty.
[03:40:22.052 --> 03:40:30.674]  I would imagine we would not want him extradited overseas to stay in trial in some place like Iraq or Afghanistan.
[03:40:30.794 --> 03:40:31.695]  Yeah, but let's be clear.
[03:40:31.695 --> 03:40:48.871]  I mean, I want specifically because you have made allegations and revelations over the years and it's come out later mainstream media confirming that you said contractors and the Pentagon have been caught shipping in Taliban, Al Qaeda to kill our own soldiers to make the war look like it's real.
[03:40:48.871 --> 03:40:51.434]  And you talked about Merck's bringing in weapons.
[03:40:51.434 --> 03:40:54.076]  You're saying there's no evidence that Blackwater was doing that.
[03:40:54.076 --> 03:40:54.757]  This was separate.
[03:40:56.285 --> 03:41:02.831]  The company that I was told was involved in this, it was the U.S.
[03:41:02.831 --> 03:41:09.197]  military, but not any specific contractor involved with bringing these people into Baghdad.
[03:41:09.197 --> 03:41:17.684]  These were Afghani Taliban who said they were there to basically set off road bombs and things like that.
[03:41:18.525 --> 03:41:30.638]  I mean, this gets in this murky area of this contracting, outsourcing by the intelligence community, the CIA, the Pentagon, but it's a free-for-all in Iraq.
[03:41:30.638 --> 03:41:35.102]  I've talked to people who've been over there recently.
[03:41:35.102 --> 03:41:40.127]  There has been no real improvement in the infrastructure in Iraq since we invaded that country in 2003.
[03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:46.873]  This is genocide, but that's what the federal filing and the FBI is saying.
[03:41:46.873 --> 03:41:48.474]  We're just reporting on what's being said here.
[03:41:51.149 --> 03:42:05.922]  Eric Prince would chastise Blackwater XC officers when they would send psychopaths home who would just enjoy killing people and raping people, and that Prince would laugh and send them back.
[03:42:05.922 --> 03:42:09.065]  Let's get into some of the federal allegations here.
[03:42:09.065 --> 03:42:15.150]  Raping children, pimping little girls, and then wife-swapping back at the... I mean, what's going on here?
[03:42:15.430 --> 03:42:33.301]  Well, yeah, these two ex-Blackwater employees who have been, who actually are testifying on behalf of the Iraqi families whose loved ones were killed by Blackwater troops in a central square in Baghdad a few years ago, they're testifying on their behalf saying that
[03:42:33.981 --> 03:42:40.685]  Back at the North Carolina headquarters, the senior executives, there was life swapping going on there.
[03:42:40.685 --> 03:42:41.866]  No action was taken.
[03:42:41.866 --> 03:42:56.155]  There was the use of what they called a man camp in Baghdad that was basically some place where Blackwater guys would go to avail themselves of prostitutes, including child prostitutes.
[03:42:56.155 --> 03:43:03.219]  They said that people who wanted to blow the whistle on all these Blackwater scandals were threatened.
[03:43:03.799 --> 03:43:06.603]  Yeah, this isn't just enemies of the contractors.
[03:43:06.603 --> 03:43:09.086]  This is women in the contracting deal.
[03:43:09.086 --> 03:43:10.708]  They'll just rape them.
[03:43:23.303 --> 03:43:25.344]  Torture them to death.
[03:43:25.344 --> 03:43:29.246]  Army, Marine Corps investigators about missing missiles, weapons.
[03:43:29.246 --> 03:43:31.708]  They just fragged them.
[03:43:31.708 --> 03:43:35.230]  I saw numbers in the thousands of fragged officers.
[03:43:35.230 --> 03:43:43.715]  I mean, this just sounds like... And the C-130s, the New York Times admitted that everyone just uses the bathroom in buckets now and everything's collapsing.
[03:43:43.715 --> 03:43:46.296]  I mean, is this... Walter Reed's collapsing.
[03:43:46.296 --> 03:43:47.217]  I mean, is this just like...
[03:43:48.416 --> 03:43:54.760]  My God, are they just... I mean, maybe the good news is they're so corrupt that everything's just going to collapse.
[03:43:54.760 --> 03:44:03.225]  Well, I mean, before these guys are returning from countries where they're eating, basically, food courtesy of KBR.
[03:44:03.225 --> 03:44:06.147]  You speak Dick Cheney's Halliburton that own that.
[03:44:06.147 --> 03:44:10.790]  But they're literally eating crap in their food, and the water is putrid.
[03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:13.932]  I would hope that they understand who the enemy is when they come back here.
[03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:22.875]  And if they're ordered to go quarantine American citizens, they ought to quarantine the people in Washington who are issuing these orders.
[03:44:22.875 --> 03:44:27.778]  But you've seen those confirmed reports where just any good looking woman out there gets basically killed.
[03:44:28.522 --> 03:44:34.005]  Yeah, and then you know how many of those cases in Iraq where they were, you know, ruled suicide?
[03:44:34.005 --> 03:44:43.549]  You know, I put that in quotation marks because some of these people, like Colonel Ted Westhusing, they said he shot himself right before he was supposed to come back to the United States.
[03:44:43.549 --> 03:44:50.513]  The Army's top ethics officer from West Point who was actually investigating contractor fraud over there at the time.
[03:44:50.513 --> 03:44:53.694]  Now, his family doesn't believe for one minute he killed himself.
[03:44:53.694 --> 03:44:56.155]  So, there's a lot of these so-called suicides.
[03:44:56.155 --> 03:44:57.436]  And they clearly killed Pat Tillman.
[03:44:58.055 --> 03:44:59.497]  Yeah, absolutely they did.
[03:44:59.497 --> 03:45:04.003]  And these are homicides that the military has never investigated.
[03:45:04.003 --> 03:45:11.252]  So I think it's time for the FBI to start investigating the Pentagon here.
[03:45:11.252 --> 03:45:13.576]  Wait, are we the most corrupt country on earth?
[03:45:14.261 --> 03:45:20.924]  Well, I mean, there are many more corrupt countries where the system is just a kleptocracy.
[03:45:20.924 --> 03:45:22.905]  Let's look at Nigeria, for example.
[03:45:22.905 --> 03:45:25.046]  Hillary's over there today.
[03:45:25.046 --> 03:45:26.407]  They may have to clean up.
[03:45:26.407 --> 03:45:29.929]  Yeah, but they generally have kingpins that kind of keep it in order, though.
[03:45:29.929 --> 03:45:35.952]  I mean, here it's just like grabbing and stealing and raping and murdering and just like wild pirates or something.
[03:45:36.573 --> 03:45:37.394]  Absolutely, yeah.
[03:45:37.394 --> 03:45:44.701]  I mean, there's no system for corruption and kleptocracy in this country.
[03:45:44.701 --> 03:45:55.152]  Yeah, a lot of people are stealing and killing, but we go around and parade around and say we're the greatest democracy on the planet, which is a laugh.
[03:45:56.351 --> 03:45:57.732]  Alright, I interrupted you on the Hillary thing.
[03:45:57.732 --> 03:46:11.665]  If we have time, we'll get back into Nigeria, but the limited time we have, the main reason I got you on, I watched your Russia Today transmission, and I did notice that some of the usual suspects have really been pushing the birther issue.
[03:46:11.665 --> 03:46:14.847]  We've just looked at it, because I don't believe anything Obama says.
[03:46:14.847 --> 03:46:23.175]  He does have a weird Barry Sotero, weird passports, mom, you know, for the Annenberg Foundation, and Geithner's dad, and all these other
[03:46:23.855 --> 03:46:31.040]  The Ford Foundation with micro-lending and Obama with weird passports into Pakistan right out of high school.
[03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:38.725]  So he looks like an intelligence front, not so much a Kenyan, but I still look at it.
[03:46:38.725 --> 03:46:50.513]  But more and more, you're saying that Israel's using this birther issue to menace him, to keep him in line, that Netanyahu has either picked up on this or is behind it.
[03:46:50.513 --> 03:46:53.435]  What is your intel, without naming names,
[03:46:53.695 --> 03:46:55.997]  Where are you getting this intel from?
[03:46:55.997 --> 03:47:10.747]  Well, I mean, this issue sort of died, and then when Obama started getting tough on the settlements with Netanyahu, all of a sudden this woman, Orly Tate, out of California, pops up with this Defender of Freedom Foundation.
[03:47:10.747 --> 03:47:13.329]  She got on television, did this big media blitz.
[03:47:16.992 --> 03:47:25.262]  She also is tied up with organizations that are linked to the Likud government and Netanyahu in Israel.
[03:47:25.262 --> 03:47:29.146]  She was born in Moldova, moved to Israel, and then came over here.
[03:47:33.191 --> 03:47:38.994]  To be questioning the nationality of the President of the United States.
[03:47:38.994 --> 03:47:43.217]  I think somebody's got to go back and see how she got in this country.
[03:47:43.217 --> 03:47:49.320]  After she makes her big allegations, two days later she pops up in Tel Aviv on television.
[03:47:49.320 --> 03:47:54.263]  Now, you know, she submitted this fake birth certificate in a lawsuit.
[03:47:54.263 --> 03:47:59.806]  Maybe she realizes that somebody must have said, even though she's a lawyer, she got her law degree apparently from some
[03:48:00.646 --> 03:48:03.868]  Some online internet university.
[03:48:03.868 --> 03:48:13.635]  But maybe somebody tapped her on the shoulder, a real lawyer, and said, you know, it's a felony to submit a non-forgery to a federal court.
[03:48:13.635 --> 03:48:18.819]  Yeah, but couldn't Israel also be putting out fake birth certificates to discredit things?
[03:48:18.819 --> 03:48:20.100]  Absolutely!
[03:48:20.100 --> 03:48:25.724]  I mean, look, they had their finger... I mean, the neocons had their fingerprints all over those
[03:48:26.204 --> 03:48:29.205]  Niger Yellow Cake documents.
[03:48:29.205 --> 03:48:41.371]  They had their fingerprints on the Iraqi oil ministry documents that showed supposedly all these anti-war politicians around the world got money from Saddam Hussein.
[03:48:41.371 --> 03:48:42.591]  These were all forgeries.
[03:48:42.591 --> 03:48:52.256]  And yes, Israel specializes in forgeries because remember the motto of the Mossad is, through deception thou shalt wage war.
[03:48:52.256 --> 03:48:54.697]  So that's just another method that they use.
[03:48:55.137 --> 03:48:58.481]  By way of deception, we shall wage war, yeah.
[03:48:58.481 --> 03:49:15.340]  The other thing is, you've got the IDF soldier, and clearly, not even just a dual citizen, pretty much, I would say he's an Israeli, the White House Chief of Staff, you know, the true joker here, Rahm Emanuel and his Dr. Death eugenics brother, I mean, what a crew.
[03:49:18.874 --> 03:49:26.124]  I mean, this is just getting crazier and crazier, and so you're saying Netanyahu may be leaking this.
[03:49:26.124 --> 03:49:30.871]  I would see it just as probable that they put out the fake birth certificates to discredit it.
[03:49:30.871 --> 03:49:35.778]  I mean, why would Israel want to get rid of Obama when he's been going along with pretty much everything they want?
[03:49:36.471 --> 03:49:44.099]  Well, Obama actually has, and there's thought that there is a feud between Emmanuel and Netanyahu over the settlement issue.
[03:49:44.099 --> 03:49:49.484]  But, you know... Yeah, the leaked Israeli ambassador to Washington thing in the Washington Post, yeah.
[03:49:49.844 --> 03:49:55.288]  Well, the Consul General in Boston, yeah, said that they were, you know, disturbing relations.
[03:49:55.288 --> 03:50:00.272]  I mean, and then there's, you know, seeing rabbis in handcuffs in New York and New Jersey.
[03:50:00.272 --> 03:50:10.620]  I mean, obviously, there's a feeling that the federal government is getting cuffed with the Israelis, and then all of a sudden this post-certificate thing pops up.
[03:50:10.620 --> 03:50:16.885]  So, you know, Netanyahu, you know, is close to this woman, Orly Tate, who was the head of the
[03:50:17.685 --> 03:50:21.547]  So you think Obama really is a few degrees tougher on Israel than Bush?
[03:50:42.472 --> 03:50:46.194]  Oh, you think that's Obama's people saying, we can blackmail you too?
[03:50:46.194 --> 03:50:47.395]  Oh, we can, yeah.
[03:50:47.395 --> 03:50:51.397]  Our Justice Department can go after your money sources over here.
[03:50:51.397 --> 03:50:53.798]  And in that case, they did.
[03:50:53.798 --> 03:50:56.160]  Wayne, tell us more about that in the final segment.
[03:50:56.160 --> 03:50:56.700]  Straight ahead.
[03:50:56.700 --> 03:50:58.181]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:51:02.179 --> 03:51:05.183]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:51:05.183 --> 03:51:10.530]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:51:10.530 --> 03:51:12.573]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:51:12.573 --> 03:51:17.159]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:51:17.559 --> 03:51:18.740]  How much do you want?
[03:51:18.740 --> 03:51:19.881]  When do you want it?
[03:51:19.881 --> 03:51:21.763]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:51:21.763 --> 03:51:22.824]  When will you need it?
[03:51:22.824 --> 03:51:25.025]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:51:25.025 --> 03:51:26.367]  Will there be any food?
[03:51:26.367 --> 03:51:27.908]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:51:27.908 --> 03:51:33.172]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:51:33.172 --> 03:51:36.755]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:51:36.755 --> 03:51:40.218]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:51:40.558 --> 03:51:41.799]  How much will you need?
[03:51:41.799 --> 03:51:42.700]  We don't know.
[03:51:42.700 --> 03:51:43.801]  How much do you want?
[03:51:43.801 --> 03:51:44.722]  All you can get.
[03:51:44.722 --> 03:51:45.823]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:51:45.823 --> 03:51:48.865]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:51:48.865 --> 03:51:49.225]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:51:49.225 --> 03:51:50.667]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:51:50.667 --> 03:51:51.567]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:52:01.972 --> 03:52:07.797]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.797 --> 03:52:15.384]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.384 --> 03:52:21.529]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.949 --> 03:52:23.930]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.930 --> 03:52:26.431]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.431 --> 03:52:37.996]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:37.996 --> 03:52:39.677]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.677 --> 03:52:41.538]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.538 --> 03:52:45.940]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told.
[03:52:46.540 --> 03:52:48.443]  And his real agenda.
[03:52:48.443 --> 03:52:56.716]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.716 --> 03:52:58.299]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.299 --> 03:52:59.501]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.499 --> 03:53:08.720]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[03:53:08.720 --> 03:53:12.661]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[03:53:12.661 --> 03:53:20.983]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[03:53:20.983 --> 03:53:23.883]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[03:53:23.883 --> 03:53:26.364]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[03:53:26.664 --> 03:53:27.104]  We're good.
[03:53:56.664 --> 03:54:00.506]  Folks, Wayne Madsen is our guest.
[03:54:00.506 --> 03:54:11.052]  We've got some other big guests tomorrow.
[03:54:11.052 --> 03:54:14.555]  And of course, open phones and a ton of important news as we track all the things that are happening.
[03:54:14.555 --> 03:54:18.677]  We're going back to Wayne here in a moment to finish up with the whole Israeli situation.
[03:54:18.677 --> 03:54:21.579]  And there's this blackmail thing going on.
[03:54:21.579 --> 03:54:23.160]  All I want is the truth, nothing more.
[03:54:23.940 --> 03:54:26.342]  As they say.
[03:54:26.342 --> 03:54:28.223]  And all we're offering is the truth.
[03:54:28.223 --> 03:54:29.224]  As best we can get at it.
[03:54:29.224 --> 03:54:30.064]  Nothing more.
[03:54:30.064 --> 03:54:31.385]  As they say in the Matrix.
[03:54:31.385 --> 03:54:35.307]  I do want to thank the sponsors that have made today's show possible before we go back to Wayne Madsen.
[03:54:35.307 --> 03:54:36.969]  Like FrontSight.com.
[03:54:36.969 --> 03:54:41.051]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[03:54:41.051 --> 03:54:42.212]  FrontSight.com.
[03:54:42.212 --> 03:54:49.677]  They're offering five days of firearms training to my listeners and a free handgun, XD pistol, in the caliber of your choice.
[03:54:50.237 --> 03:54:54.839]  Their August classes are filling up quickly, almost sold out, but they have a bunch in September.
[03:54:54.839 --> 03:54:56.800]  Those are filling up quickly with this deal.
[03:54:56.800 --> 03:54:59.581]  FrontSite.com.
[03:54:59.581 --> 03:55:00.761]  You can't beat this deal.
[03:55:00.761 --> 03:55:06.404]  This is above law enforcement military training, with no drill instructor or macho attitude.
[03:55:06.404 --> 03:55:07.764]  It's a family event.
[03:55:07.764 --> 03:55:11.786]  There's also a lot of free stuff online at FrontSite.com, so check it out.
[03:55:11.786 --> 03:55:14.587]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[03:55:14.587 --> 03:55:17.428]  Your safety, your family's safety, is paramount.
[03:55:19.597 --> 03:55:21.119]  Also, I want to thank Ecola Blue.
[03:55:21.119 --> 03:55:27.986]  This is just an awesome atmospheric water generator that then sends it through seven filters, and it's all computerized and nice and easy to use.
[03:55:27.986 --> 03:55:34.133]  Grabs the water out of the air, condenses it in an illuminated stainless steel tank with anti-fungal, anti-UV.
[03:55:35.034 --> 03:55:35.915]  Grabs it right out of the air.
[03:55:35.915 --> 03:55:37.636]  They even sell solar panels that go with it.
[03:55:37.636 --> 03:55:43.880]  If you don't want to plug it into the wall and want to be off the grid, acolablue.com, acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, acolablue.com.
[03:55:53.118 --> 03:55:58.041]  And in closing here, I want to thank MySolarBackup.com.
[03:55:58.041 --> 03:56:00.383]  This is a great little solar backup system.
[03:56:00.383 --> 03:56:04.205]  You get multiple units and run even more of your house off of it.
[03:56:04.205 --> 03:56:12.471]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of power source, 800 watt generator, a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:56:12.471 --> 03:56:14.993]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks.
[03:56:14.993 --> 03:56:16.474]  So make your move today.
[03:56:16.474 --> 03:56:17.755]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:56:17.755 --> 03:56:19.656]  That's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:56:22.998 --> 03:56:23.679]  You got the floor.
[03:56:23.679 --> 03:56:31.406]  Finishing up, Wayne, with the Israeli situation and you have sources or are you just saying you believe that this rabbi thing with the organs and the money and New Jersey just black hole corruption?
[03:56:49.602 --> 03:56:50.582]  Right, right.
[03:56:50.582 --> 03:56:52.103]  No, I had people in the U.S.
[03:56:52.103 --> 03:56:57.606]  intelligence community contact me and said, look, this is not a coincidence.
[03:56:57.606 --> 03:57:01.267]  This is how the administration is sending a signal back to Netanyahu.
[03:57:01.267 --> 03:57:07.590]  It was basically from his nose that our request for him to freeze those settlements.
[03:57:09.432 --> 03:57:14.198]  I think we could probably play tougher.
[03:57:14.198 --> 03:57:19.425]  I would like to see more done, but I think they're going as far, probably, as we're going to see.
[03:57:19.425 --> 03:57:22.930]  Maybe they can go a little bit farther, but I really think the
[03:57:24.852 --> 03:57:40.061]  What we may see, what I'm hearing too, is now that Netanyahu's been linked to this personal attack on President Obama, we may see somebody start digging up some stuff on Netanyahu's past, especially when he lived in the Philadelphia area.
[03:57:40.061 --> 03:57:49.186]  I'm hearing rumors that his past there may leave a lot to be desired among some of the more religious elements that support him in Israel.
[03:57:49.186 --> 03:57:51.607]  No!
[03:57:51.607 --> 03:57:52.048]  You mean a...
[03:57:53.908 --> 03:57:56.869]  The type of stuff that goes on in the Republicans?
[03:57:56.869 --> 03:58:01.031]  Maybe he spent a little too much time on Rittenhouse Square in downtown Philly.
[03:58:01.031 --> 03:58:08.195]  Anyone who's familiar with that area knows that that's, how should I put it, a rather bohemian mixed neighborhood.
[03:58:08.195 --> 03:58:10.376]  Hmm.
[03:58:10.376 --> 03:58:12.637]  You mean a bohemian grove type stuff?
[03:58:12.637 --> 03:58:14.257]  Yeah, maybe.
[03:58:14.257 --> 03:58:14.697]  Maybe.
[03:58:14.697 --> 03:58:16.899]  Okay, Wayne Madsen, always informative.
[03:58:16.899 --> 03:58:18.859]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:58:18.859 --> 03:58:21.260]  Thank you for popping in and spending time with us today.
[03:58:21.260 --> 03:58:22.141]  I really appreciate it.
[03:58:22.771 --> 03:58:24.091]  Good to be with you.
[03:58:24.091 --> 03:58:25.312]  Wayne Madsen Report.com.
[03:58:25.312 --> 03:58:30.573]  Our websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net.
[03:58:30.573 --> 03:58:35.755]  We'll post the video of this live radio show up at PrisonPlanet.tv from the live transmission.
[03:58:35.755 --> 03:58:36.815]  Great job crew.
[03:58:36.815 --> 03:58:38.015]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:38.015 --> 03:58:43.237]  Spread the word and don't take the flu shot.
[03:58:43.237 --> 03:58:45.118]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.118 --> 03:58:47.298]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.428 --> 03:58:56.632]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:56.632 --> 03:59:00.655]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.655 --> 03:59:06.560]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.560 --> 03:59:11.623]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.623 --> 03:59:18.168]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:18.168 --> 03:59:20.350]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storms
[03:59:20.350 --> 03:59:20.590]  We're good.
