[00:00:05.086 --> 00:00:09.269]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.730]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:12.451]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:16.734]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:21.298]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:31.681]  We are now simulcasting the last two hours of this four-hour weekday radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv for all the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:33.722]  I want to thank you for joining us and all of your support.
[00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:40.146]  I had checked into this book and seen really great reviews from a lot of researchers and historians that I respect.
[00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.687]  I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
[00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:49.853]  It's Russ Baker, Family of Secrets, the Bush Dynasty, the powerful forces that put in the White House and what their influence means for America.
[00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:52.915]  And separately in my own research, you have Prescott Bush,
[00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:54.016]  I think?
[00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:20.604]  Like Tarpley, who again is not a quote right winger, he calls himself a progressive, the research that Nixon got out of control and so they shot him down.
[00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:31.993]  Not saying Nixon's a good guy, the point is that was all a huge setup and also to weaken the presidency at that time so the national security state could fully take over the executive and that's what we really face today.
[00:01:32.453 --> 00:01:33.834]  So just an amazing
[00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:38.196]  A book, and it is, of course, Family of Secrets.
[00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:39.496]  So, Russ Baker, thanks for coming in.
[00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:40.476]  My pleasure, Alex.
[00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:41.317]  It's good to have you here.
[00:01:41.397 --> 00:01:42.797]  Okay, we're going to break in a few minutes.
[00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:45.238]  This is a short segment, but tell us about yourself, your research.
[00:01:45.258 --> 00:01:53.600]  You told me that researching for this book kind of changed your whole political paradigm, gets in a lot of the shadow workings of things, and C-SPAN just covered it for Book TV.
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.160]  That'll be airing soon, or was it live?
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.140]  It'll be airing soon.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.480]  Yeah.
[00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:58.701]  I've been on C-SPAN, too, and waited a few weeks to air it.
[00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:01.202]  So, Family of Secrets, critically acclaimed.
[00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:02.402]  Tell us about yourself.
[00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:03.022]  Sure.
[00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:06.264]  Well, I've been an investigative journalist for about 20 years.
[00:02:06.284 --> 00:02:15.951]  I would describe myself either as an alternative journalist working in the mainstream, or a mainstream journalist working in the alternative media.
[00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:29.520]  And I've worked, written for publications varying from the New York Times, Vanity Fair, Esquire, to The Nation and The Village Voice, Huffington Post, a large range of different sorts of publications.
[00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:36.106]  And I am a reporter and I think that there are different books on these subjects.
[00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:39.769]  Some people consider themselves scholars, some people consider themselves activists.
[00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.673]  I'm essentially a reporter and I just follow the facts wherever they go.
[00:02:43.693 --> 00:02:52.761]  I began working on this book about five years ago simply with the question, how did a guy like George W. Bush become the most powerful person in the world?
[00:02:53.106 --> 00:03:09.040]  I just found that to be a staggering proposition in and of itself and I just wondered if there was not more to the story than we understood there to be and so I began looking into him and this led me to
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:20.405]  Start examining his relationship to the people who backed him, his relationship to his father, and I really went down the rabbit's hole, Alex.
[00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:28.609]  I discovered a whole new understanding of American history of the last 50 years, and that's really what I hope we have a chance to talk about.
[00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:34.051]  Yeah, Woodward and Bernstein with Naval Intelligence and the Bilderberg Group controlled Washington Post.
[00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:35.892]  They daringly went after Nixon.
[00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:44.636]  America learned how to fight back against corruption and then meanwhile the shadow government really just got even more power and expanded their control.
[00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:45.216]  So I want to
[00:03:45.776 --> 00:03:50.819]  We'll break this down after we come back from break, but continue in the time we've got left in this segment describing the book.
[00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:51.339]  Sure.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.621]  Actually, what happened was I'd been sent over, believe it or not, by the U.S.
[00:03:54.661 --> 00:04:07.289]  government to the former Yugoslavia, where I was asked to train journalists there in how to question authority and keep their government honest.
[00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.951]  And while I was working there, we had the run-up to the war in Iraq, the invasion.
[00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:13.932]  And people began asking me, what about your own government?
[00:04:13.972 --> 00:04:17.673]  How much do you understand about your own government, your own president, the decisions they make there?
[00:04:17.973 --> 00:04:19.493]  You're teaching us to do this work here.
[00:04:19.513 --> 00:04:20.554]  What about your own country?
[00:04:20.874 --> 00:04:27.476]  And as I traveled around Europe, I just was staggered by the extent to which the popularity of the United States had just plummeted.
[00:04:27.536 --> 00:04:30.977]  And I just felt I had to get back and get trying to answer these questions.
[00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:37.424]  I came back in 2004 and began traveling around the country.
[00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:45.210]  I came to Austin here, it was one of the places I came to, and I began just assembling groups of people for drinks and just said, hey, what do you think is behind this Bush thing?
[00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:53.256]  Is there nothing more than a guy this seemingly untalented and this uninterested that he could just get to the top?
[00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:54.657]  Or was there something else going on?
[00:04:54.717 --> 00:04:55.918]  All that heavy money?
[00:04:56.178 --> 00:05:00.921]  We're gonna tell that story that you compellingly document in Family of Secrets straight ahead.
[00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:06.545]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:11.568]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:05:12.008 --> 00:05:12.328]  I think so.
[00:05:34.673 --> 00:05:36.534]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.642]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.342 --> 00:06:12.687]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:19.412]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.554]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:24.096]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:33.884]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.072]  That's fascism.
[00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:38.613]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:40.394]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:47.196]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:56.038 --> 00:06:57.179]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:58.859]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.160]  You worry.
[00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.291]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:05.853]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:07:06.274 --> 00:07:08.075]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:09.616]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:13.199]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:18.463]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:07:18.843 --> 00:07:22.166]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:07:22.826 --> 00:07:24.147]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:07:24.507 --> 00:07:27.109]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.352]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:07:30.854 --> 00:07:39.017]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:07:39.497 --> 00:07:43.879]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.702]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:07:53.722 --> 00:07:55.443]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:08:05.347 --> 00:08:05.988]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.648 --> 00:08:07.689]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.470]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:10.992]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:12.713]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.733 --> 00:08:17.037]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.517 --> 00:08:21.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:24.302]  Russ Baker, Family of Secrets.
[00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:29.706]  We've only got about 30 minutes left with him, and we've got a guest coming on about mass graves they're building all over the country.
[00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:30.666]  We've got photos of it.
[00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:33.808]  And then we've got Webster Targly joining us from D.C.
[00:08:34.488 --> 00:08:35.589]  Russ Baker lives in New York.
[00:08:35.609 --> 00:08:36.529]  It's great to have him here.
[00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.810]  On such short notice we found out he was in town and got him in.
[00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.651]  He was here for C-SPAN.
[00:08:40.051 --> 00:08:44.914]  Next time you're here, please come in for a couple hours, because the book is lengthy and the research is amazing.
[00:08:45.794 --> 00:08:47.155]  Go ahead and just run through it.
[00:08:47.575 --> 00:08:47.855]  Sure.
[00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:50.356]  So basically what happened was when I got back in 2004,
[00:08:51.557 --> 00:08:51.898]  We're good.
[00:09:09.478 --> 00:09:23.605]  And I was intrigued by this because very clearly, I mean, it appeared that there were some questions about his record and yet somehow they were so effective as a propaganda device, his administration, his team, that they were intimidating the media.
[00:09:23.826 --> 00:09:27.928]  They were turning this against John Kerry, who had served in Vietnam.
[00:09:28.148 --> 00:09:29.228]  And I was fascinated by that.
[00:09:29.248 --> 00:09:30.309]  So I began looking at that.
[00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:35.652]  Out of that came a piece I did for The Nation magazine, which won a Deadline Club Award.
[00:09:36.472 --> 00:09:37.092]  I think?
[00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:55.739]  I think?
[00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:18.715]  You know, the chewing tobacco, wearing cowboy boots, you know, he was a different kind of a guy than the sort of stuffed shirt father.
[00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:25.441]  And what I discovered was that this rift, this purported rift between the father and son had been manufactured.
[00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:32.968]  That it had been manufactured for the purposes of making the son electable, because the father, as we know, was defeated in 1992.
[00:10:33.548 --> 00:10:36.631]  And they wanted the son to appear to be a different kind of a guy.
[00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:44.356]  In fact, what I discovered at Looking at the Sun was that he'd been involved in a whole bunch of companies that have never before been reported on.
[00:10:45.036 --> 00:10:47.238]  Just one of them is called Lucky Chance Mining.
[00:10:47.278 --> 00:10:48.899]  These are very, very interesting companies.
[00:10:48.979 --> 00:10:57.524]  Somehow these have eluded all of the biographers, all of the reporters in the Washington Post, New York Times and so on that did stories about George W. Bush.
[00:10:58.265 --> 00:11:04.549]  And these companies are very interesting, Alex, because they have all the hallmarks of being intelligence operations.
[00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:06.390]  None of the companies make any money.
[00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:18.514]  They all have funds coming in from offshore accounts, from Saudis, money connected to Ferdinand Marcos, to the South African Apartheid regime, to the Shah of Iran.
[00:11:18.634 --> 00:11:19.974]  Very, very strange outfits.
[00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:22.235]  And so I thought, well, what is this guy doing?
[00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:23.735]  What is George W. Bush doing?
[00:11:23.755 --> 00:11:25.236]  He's in these very strange outfits.
[00:11:25.556 --> 00:11:28.397]  And this forced me then to start looking at his relationship with his father.
[00:11:28.677 --> 00:11:30.399]  Then we have George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:34.003]  So you start out an investigation of Bush, and it leads you back into the family history.
[00:11:34.023 --> 00:11:45.315]  I mean, where did this guy, I suppose he's never been in the CIA, the senior, and then suddenly he's director of the CIA, and then meanwhile they have ships named the Barbara, and there's... The Zapata.
[00:11:45.675 --> 00:11:46.436]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:49.978]  They're an oil company involved in CIA operations, Bay of Pigs.
[00:11:49.998 --> 00:11:55.681]  But yeah, let's get into the roots of it, because it's just amazing, especially the Nixon tie-in.
[00:11:55.741 --> 00:11:56.682]  Right, right.
[00:11:56.702 --> 00:11:58.883]  So what I did was I began looking at the father.
[00:11:59.104 --> 00:12:03.166]  And when I looked at the father, I wondered why would they make him CIA director in 1976?
[00:12:03.366 --> 00:12:08.870]  This is a guy who's a purported intelligence virgin, a guy who doesn't have any background in intel.
[00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.052]  They supposedly put him in because they're claiming they're cleaning up the agency
[00:12:12.512 --> 00:12:17.337]  Frank Church has his church committee which is investigating all kinds of abuses, assassinations, etc.
[00:12:17.858 --> 00:12:18.659]  And they bring him in.
[00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:21.802]  Well, the answer is, Poppy Bush is the nickname for the father.
[00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:26.327]  I called George, the younger one, W in the book, and Poppy, the father.
[00:12:26.347 --> 00:12:28.449]  Those are their nicknames, easier to distinguish between them.
[00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:32.592]  Poppy actually turns out had a background in the CIA, not just 1976.
[00:12:32.712 --> 00:12:51.308]  I've got documents in the book where he's in the CIA in 1963 at the time of the Kennedy assassination, and he's in the CIA in 1953 when he starts Zapata and Zapata Offshore, and he begins traveling all over the world on business, even though he's got this tiny company with almost no justification for it.
[00:12:51.648 --> 00:12:54.711]  He's even putting offices in places like Medellin, Colombia.
[00:12:55.512 --> 00:12:57.293]  Which is nowhere near the coast.
[00:12:57.353 --> 00:13:03.499]  I mean, why would you have an offshore drilling company that has almost no rigs with an office in a place like that?
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.302]  And so I'm digging into the father.
[00:13:06.923 --> 00:13:09.545]  I discovered that the father basically had an entire secret life.
[00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:12.909]  That the oil man thing was a cover.
[00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:14.971]  Being a congressman was essentially a cover.
[00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:18.655]  The man he started Zapata with, a guy named Thomas J. Devine Jr.
[00:13:19.595 --> 00:13:29.599]  was a career intelligence officer and he quote-unquote retired from the agency at the tender age of about 26 after they'd spent millions on him to go into the oil business with Poppy Bush.
[00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:39.023]  So this is the beginning and then in Family of Secrets I track this through very curious things about Poppy Bush at the time of the Kennedy assassination.
[00:13:39.063 --> 00:13:42.184]  He, by the way, has publicly said he cannot remember where he was.
[00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:46.326]  But there's a CIA document that has a George H.W.
[00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:49.927]  Bush in the CIA and in Texas at the time, but they say, oh, that's another Bush.
[00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:51.808]  Well, it wasn't another Bush, it was him.
[00:13:51.828 --> 00:13:57.691]  We have photos of him outside the school book depository.
[00:13:57.711 --> 00:13:58.491]  I mean, it's him.
[00:13:58.511 --> 00:13:59.932]  You can look at the photo, it's him.
[00:14:00.963 --> 00:14:03.605]  One of the interesting things is that there are several memos.
[00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:11.631]  There's one from the day after the assassination in which the FBI is giving a briefing to George Bush of the CIA.
[00:14:12.172 --> 00:14:17.515]  There's another document from the day of the assassination where George H.W.
[00:14:17.555 --> 00:14:20.498]  Bush, clearly him with his address listed in a
[00:14:21.998 --> 00:14:25.599]  He is calling in to say, I may know who has killed the President.
[00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:29.741]  And he wants to inform on a fellow, he says, I don't know much about this man.
[00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:44.045]  What I discover and I document in one of the four chapters of new material on the Kennedy assassination in Family of Secrets, is that the man he was ratting out, at the very moment he was ratting him out, Bush's own assistant was going to that man's house to give him an alibi.
[00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:46.656]  This is very, very complex stuff.
[00:14:46.676 --> 00:14:47.436]  Very deep stuff.
[00:14:47.476 --> 00:14:48.457]  Very profound stuff.
[00:14:48.477 --> 00:14:54.540]  Well, they always, in intelligence ops, just do random crazy things to create a fog and all sorts of rabbit trails.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.662]  I mean, that's how they do the most slick operations.
[00:14:58.082 --> 00:15:04.225]  Well, I encourage people to read that chapter very carefully and try to figure out what they think is going on.
[00:15:04.305 --> 00:15:06.447]  I try not to be bombastic.
[00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:08.968]  I try not to force people to conclusions.
[00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:10.149]  I just lay out facts.
[00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:12.630]  There are more than a thousand footnotes in this book.
[00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.436]  What do you think about the guy that wrote Fortunate Son ending up dead in a hotel bathtub?
[00:15:16.456 --> 00:15:17.799]  I mean, are you kind of worried about being in it?
[00:15:17.939 --> 00:15:18.841]  Because they kill people.
[00:15:20.034 --> 00:15:23.195]  You know, all I can tell you is I'm healthy, I'm happy.
[00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:24.895]  Plus, that was during the campaign.
[00:15:24.915 --> 00:15:26.415]  They were really worried about it at that time.
[00:15:27.236 --> 00:15:29.016]  So, I mean, I'm certainly not accident-prone.
[00:15:29.036 --> 00:15:29.676]  But I told the D.C.
[00:15:29.716 --> 00:15:30.116]  madam that.
[00:15:30.136 --> 00:15:31.196]  I said, they're probably going to try to kill you.
[00:15:31.216 --> 00:15:33.757]  And then, privately, she told me, yeah, I'm getting followed and harassed.
[00:15:33.797 --> 00:15:35.137]  But on air, she said, oh, I'm fine.
[00:15:35.177 --> 00:15:35.657]  I'm not worried.
[00:15:35.697 --> 00:15:36.217]  And they killed her.
[00:15:36.237 --> 00:15:37.658]  I mean, they really do kill people.
[00:15:37.718 --> 00:15:39.118]  And they're not very nice folks.
[00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:42.239]  But you got a lot of courage writing this book, all this original research.
[00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:45.040]  You're being so well-documented.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.260]  Let's go back to the beginning, though.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.201]  That's really intriguing.
[00:15:47.681 --> 00:15:49.842]  Where does the Bush power come from?
[00:15:49.862 --> 00:15:53.144]  I mean, obviously, skull and bones is the opium-dealing cartel.
[00:15:53.904 --> 00:15:56.945]  They then make opium illegal so they can jack up prices.
[00:15:56.965 --> 00:15:58.046]  I mean, that's a separate issue.
[00:15:58.086 --> 00:15:58.866]  That's on the record.
[00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:01.908]  But going back to Nixon and that whole story.
[00:16:03.008 --> 00:16:06.130]  One of the things that intrigued me was basically George W. Bush.
[00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.851]  W. would never have been President of the United States if his father had not been President.
[00:16:09.871 --> 00:16:12.912]  There's no question on his own he would not have made it to the top.
[00:16:13.213 --> 00:16:16.574]  So what I wanted to know was how had his father made it to the top?
[00:16:16.814 --> 00:16:19.835]  And the answer was Richard Nixon gave him all of these opportunities.
[00:16:20.496 --> 00:16:25.558]  He was only a freshman congressman when he got on the short list to be considered for Vice President.
[00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:28.600]  With Richard Nixon in 1968.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.621]  1970 he ran for U.S.
[00:16:29.641 --> 00:16:29.921]  Senate.
[00:16:29.941 --> 00:16:30.442]  He lost.
[00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:38.068]  And he was immediately appointed the Ambassador to the United Nations at a very, very delicate moment in American relations with China and so forth.
[00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:43.253]  After that, he's made the Chairman of the Republican Party at the height of Watergate.
[00:16:43.793 --> 00:16:47.076]  And then he sent off his envoy to China when things get too hot on Watergate.
[00:16:47.196 --> 00:16:49.458]  None of these things he was qualified for.
[00:16:49.818 --> 00:16:51.378]  He used to make jokes to friends about it.
[00:16:51.418 --> 00:16:55.279]  They said, why are you, what do you know about foreign relations to be at the UN?
[00:16:55.299 --> 00:16:56.559]  He said, ask me in two weeks.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.460]  He was going to bone up or something.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.181]  Anyway, my question was, why did Richard Nixon favor Poppy Bush?
[00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:06.421]  And the answer, I had to dig all the way back.
[00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:18.184]  And Alex, what I discovered was that in the 1940s, when Richard Nixon first became a candidate for Congress from Whittier, California, that Prescott Bush, the grandfather, was actually in Whittier.
[00:17:18.664 --> 00:17:20.807]  Buying a defense contractor company.
[00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:23.630]  I do not believe this has ever been reported before.
[00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.852]  And they needed their representative, their man.
[00:17:25.872 --> 00:17:27.955]  Well, they needed their man, but there was something else going on.
[00:17:27.975 --> 00:17:30.778]  There was a congressman, a democrat named Jerry Voorhees.
[00:17:31.238 --> 00:17:33.501]  And Jerry Voorhees is the guy that Nixon beat.
[00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:37.906]  Now, they say that they ran Nixon against him because Jerry Voorhees was too liberal.
[00:17:38.206 --> 00:17:38.386]  I don't
[00:18:00.448 --> 00:18:01.209]  I don't
[00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.714]  Looking for someone to run against him.
[00:18:23.754 --> 00:18:30.512]  He just didn't know who it was and it seems that it was Prescott Bush because he was there buying that company in the district right at that moment.
[00:18:33.525 --> 00:18:36.907]  ...every once in a while our connection to the network is broke, but we're back up on the backup.
[00:18:37.147 --> 00:18:37.687]  Okay, good.
[00:18:37.887 --> 00:18:39.007]  Please repeat what you just said.
[00:18:39.247 --> 00:18:39.508]  Sure.
[00:18:40.668 --> 00:18:46.551]  So Nixon, basically they wanted him in there in order to beat Jerry Voorhees.
[00:18:47.111 --> 00:18:55.814]  Prescott Bush and his buddies were concerned about Jerry Voorhees' activities trying to regulate these powerful financial interests.
[00:18:56.175 --> 00:19:00.096]  Anyway, I think what happened was Richard Nixon was basically
[00:19:01.997 --> 00:19:02.478]  I think?
[00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:19.236]  I don't
[00:19:39.216 --> 00:19:40.557]  Not putting my son on there.
[00:19:41.257 --> 00:19:58.548]  And what you see right from the beginning of the Nixon administration is efforts, and I document this in three chapters, all new information, efforts to remove Richard Nixon from office by these financial interests, oil interests, by these people in the intelligence community and in the military.
[00:19:59.528 --> 00:20:00.029]  Stay there!
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.722]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:20:06.762 --> 00:20:07.283]  and the world.
[00:20:07.563 --> 00:20:11.024]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:20:11.425 --> 00:20:17.647]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:20:17.927 --> 00:20:19.708]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:20:19.948 --> 00:20:27.892]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:20:28.172 --> 00:20:32.596]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:38.420]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.702]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:20:40.862 --> 00:20:43.104]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:20:43.444 --> 00:20:44.245]  Free of charge.

[00:20:53.012 --> 00:20:53.793]  Factory direct.

[00:20:57.136 --> 00:21:05.864]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:06.425 --> 00:21:13.511]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.011 --> 00:21:20.236]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:20.596 --> 00:21:22.438]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:22.558 --> 00:21:25.000]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:36.029]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:36.653 --> 00:21:37.933]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.313 --> 00:21:39.674]  It's about a one world government.
[00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:46.535]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:21:55.337 --> 00:21:56.497]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:56.917 --> 00:21:58.177]  The people strike back.
[00:22:01.598 --> 00:22:02.718]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:08.632]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, and investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:09.212 --> 00:22:09.713]  That's right.
[00:22:10.033 --> 00:22:12.313]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:19.835]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:20.355 --> 00:22:27.997]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:28.482 --> 00:22:33.345]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:33.965 --> 00:22:38.988]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:43.911]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:44.552]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:46.493]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:46.553 --> 00:22:46.873]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.153 --> 00:22:47.433]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.713 --> 00:23:07.799]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:12.362]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:23:12.522 --> 00:23:17.045]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:23:17.205 --> 00:23:18.606]  It's a documented fact.
[00:23:19.486 --> 00:23:26.089]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:38.095]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[00:23:38.335 --> 00:23:41.997]  FPP is now available to you from FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[00:23:42.617 --> 00:23:44.998]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:23:45.738 --> 00:23:49.419]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[00:23:49.479 --> 00:23:52.721]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:23:52.781 --> 00:23:52.981]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:14.263]  The book is Family of Secrets, the author is Russ Baker, and I had to have him on the phone the next few weeks for more than an hour.
[00:24:14.283 --> 00:24:17.244]  A little bit of time we have today, 40 minutes, he said he was going to do it.
[00:24:18.464 --> 00:24:25.227]  Race through it, because again, I've done so much research, you've done even more, and to be reading through the book while we're on break, I just see so many amazing things.
[00:24:25.827 --> 00:24:29.609]  Like the bottlers convention with Nixon in Dallas, when Kennedy's killed.
[00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:36.211]  Just all the amazing photos and documents and letters that you've got in this book.
[00:24:36.551 --> 00:24:40.392]  Please continue with your discovery that they were setting up Nixon all along.
[00:24:41.152 --> 00:24:49.475]  Sure, I mean what intrigued me, and I have to say by the way that two of the major revelations in the book, one is about the Kennedy assassination,
[00:24:49.855 --> 00:25:18.845]  and the involvement of the intelligence community in organizing it uh... and these curious coincidences uh... in which george h w bush keeps showing up in relation that by the way one of those other coincidences is that there was a a family friend of george h w bush by the name of george demore and shelled and he was a white russian emigre with intelligence ties he also happened to be lee harvey oswald's father figure in the year before the assassination this man practically
[00:25:19.825 --> 00:25:45.487]  uh... organized all aspects of lee harvey oswald's life this is not mentioned very widely at all you can find bits and pieces on him in a few other books and on the internet but i've gone i have a whole chapter on george demore and she'll his uh... his nephew was that was a roommate in prep school with poppy bush and uh... uh... so this man was so close to to uh... well there's a hard-on is it now admitted that running operation to kill kennedy
[00:25:46.207 --> 00:25:47.207]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:25:47.467 --> 00:25:47.727]  Sure.
[00:25:48.347 --> 00:25:51.288]  Anyway, so this Kennedy stuff, we don't have time here to go into all of it.
[00:25:51.308 --> 00:25:58.850]  There are four chapters on the Kennedy assassination, with a number of figures associated with George H.W.
[00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.450]  Bush there.
[00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:14.453]  People who were in the lead car of the motorcade, involved with a very secret military intelligence unit in Dallas, headed by a man who was essentially Poppy Bush's running mate in 1963.
[00:26:16.973 --> 00:26:24.796]  And the man who got them to run for office that year, whose family was revealed to be a CIA-funded foundation.
[00:26:25.437 --> 00:26:26.957]  Anyway, it's very, very deep stuff.
[00:26:26.977 --> 00:26:27.978]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:26:28.718 --> 00:26:32.199]  I had always sort of not followed the Kennedy assassination.
[00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:35.681]  Most journalists like myself just know that it's just too much of a quagmire.
[00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:38.242]  So I said, all right, you know, maybe Oswald did it alone.
[00:26:38.262 --> 00:26:44.004]  Well, I have had to completely revise my thinking on that as a result of the research that went into Family of Secrets.
[00:26:44.284 --> 00:26:45.585]  Now, Nixon.
[00:26:45.605 --> 00:26:46.466]  You asked about Nixon.
[00:26:46.866 --> 00:26:47.647]  It's the same thing.
[00:26:47.667 --> 00:26:59.197]  I had always assumed that Nixon was just this sort of out-of-control president, the conventional story, that he was behind all of these things, including the Watergate burglary and certainly the cover-up
[00:26:59.477 --> 00:27:09.522]  What I discovered in my research, and again, were the fingerprints of Poppy Bush, who was the Republican chairman at the time, at the height of the Watergate scandal, and yet he's not mentioned.
[00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:13.044]  You read those books on Watergate, Poppy Bush is never mentioned.
[00:27:13.084 --> 00:27:15.685]  He's not mentioned in books about him and books about Nixon.
[00:27:16.006 --> 00:27:17.406]  He's like the anti-Zellig.
[00:27:17.626 --> 00:27:18.607]  He just doesn't exist.
[00:27:18.667 --> 00:27:20.428]  How did you get Bloomsbury Press?
[00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:25.891]  I know you're an award-winning journalist, but how did you get them to... This is an incendiary book, and that's a pretty good publisher.
[00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:34.594]  It is a good publisher and I admire them greatly for being willing to show some courage and put out a book like this.
[00:27:34.914 --> 00:27:39.016]  A lot of my friends in the mainstream media, they said, you will never get this published, you'll never get it out.
[00:27:39.656 --> 00:27:43.757]  What our challenge is right now, Alex, is that there's a bit of a wall of silence out there.
[00:27:43.797 --> 00:27:45.678]  The New York Times has not reviewed the book.
[00:27:46.318 --> 00:27:48.979]  Uh, even though I have a lot of friends there and I've written for that paper.
[00:27:48.999 --> 00:27:51.401]  Uh, there was an attack on it by somebody in the L.A.
[00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:51.901]  Times.
[00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:53.942]  Uh, and, but generally silence.
[00:27:53.982 --> 00:27:55.963]  We have not been able to get on to most of the national shows.
[00:27:55.983 --> 00:27:57.363]  Yeah, attacks are better than silence.
[00:27:57.623 --> 00:27:58.704]  Yeah, oh, absolutely.
[00:27:58.964 --> 00:28:00.365]  But generally a silence.
[00:28:00.485 --> 00:28:02.566]  And we, there's no justification for it.
[00:28:02.606 --> 00:28:11.270]  This book has, as, as many of the reviewers, uh, people like Roger Morris, uh, who's been on the National Security Council, Gore Vidal, they have all praised the book.
[00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:22.497]  They all say it's a revelation per page, stuff that even people like Roger Morris, who wrote an acclaimed book on Nixon and an acclaimed book on the Clintons, he didn't know any of this stuff.
[00:28:23.278 --> 00:28:29.021]  And with all that, really we should be out there with a major explosive bestseller, but we cannot get the traction.
[00:28:30.462 --> 00:28:38.608]  Is we are going out over the airwaves with people like you who have the guts to get the story out through the internet, through YouTube, whatever we can do.
[00:28:38.628 --> 00:28:43.632]  And we're really trying to have a kind of a guerrilla movement to get word out because 99.9% of people don't even know.
[00:28:43.652 --> 00:28:46.014]  No, I mean, I have to say, I've read the reviews of the book.
[00:28:46.054 --> 00:28:47.215]  I was intending to get it and read it.
[00:28:47.675 --> 00:28:53.580]  And I'd actually, like a few weeks ago, given something to my producer, a sheet on it, saying, let's get this, but we forget things.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.442]  And just scanning through it, it's just an amazing book.
[00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:59.064]  And we've only got one more segment left coming up.
[00:29:01.006 --> 00:29:04.111]  But start getting into how they destroyed Nixon, because... Sure, sure.
[00:29:04.412 --> 00:29:09.060]  Well, basically what they did was, in the book I reveal a series...
[00:29:10.889 --> 00:29:15.950]  In the book, I reveal a series of different operations that were precursors to the Watergate break-in.
[00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:19.090]  And the break-in, by the way, was deliberately so ham-handed.
[00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.491]  In other words, they were doing everything they could to get caught.
[00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:28.112]  And that's why they had these checks and everything that were traceable back to the Republican Party and to the White House.
[00:29:28.552 --> 00:29:32.833]  They were trying to set up Richard Nixon, but they were doing things before the Watergate break-in.
[00:29:33.093 --> 00:29:38.774]  And in Family of Secrets, I document those earlier unsuccessful operations to smear Nixon.
[00:29:39.494 --> 00:29:50.141]  Just bizarre, but well documented, because a lot of other amazing researchers, not on this breadth or this focus on the bushes, have documented that separately, so I know it's true.
[00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:52.042]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.522 --> 00:29:54.123]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.064 --> 00:29:57.726]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.922 --> 00:30:02.844]  Do you depend on the grocery store for your food?
[00:30:03.204 --> 00:30:05.006]  It's time to think outside the box.
[00:30:05.366 --> 00:30:07.068]  How about starting your own garden?
[00:30:07.328 --> 00:30:09.430]  To ensure your future, you purchase the seeds.

[00:30:51.749 --> 00:30:54.372]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.328 --> 00:31:12.672]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.212 --> 00:31:19.417]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.717 --> 00:31:21.538]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.678 --> 00:31:24.080]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:35.028]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.319 --> 00:31:38.600]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.380]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:47.183]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:31:56.026 --> 00:31:57.166]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.586 --> 00:31:58.787]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.313]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[00:32:04.473 --> 00:32:09.197]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[00:32:09.317 --> 00:32:12.079]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:16.562]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[00:32:16.722 --> 00:32:17.463]  Every three seconds.
[00:32:17.503 --> 00:32:18.143]  We're good to go.
[00:32:40.589 --> 00:32:41.050]  We're good to go.
[00:33:11.275 --> 00:33:19.280]  There's a man going around taking names, and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:33:21.641 --> 00:33:24.463]  Everybody will be treated all the same.
[00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:29.266]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[00:33:31.447 --> 00:33:34.649]  Family of secrets, the Bush dynasty, the powerful forces that
[00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:39.099]  Put in the White House and what their influence means for America.
[00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:43.644]  We're going to go back to that here in just a moment with our guest in studio.
[00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:47.453]  We're going to get to these mass graves they're building all over the country.
[00:33:47.533 --> 00:33:52.997]  We've had emergency managers on, journalists on, and the Pentagon admits they're doing it, and they do it by night.
[00:33:53.037 --> 00:33:58.881]  They go in and just put in all these big mass concrete graves outside large government cemeteries.
[00:33:58.901 --> 00:34:00.783]  Are they getting ready for World War III or something?
[00:34:00.823 --> 00:34:01.243]  Who knows?
[00:34:01.263 --> 00:34:01.944]  We're going to be covering it.
[00:34:02.284 --> 00:34:03.945]  Photos are up on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:04.806 --> 00:34:14.193]  Also, I've been wanting to do this on air for one of our new sponsors, folks.
[00:34:16.107 --> 00:34:16.467]  That's right.
[00:34:35.908 --> 00:34:38.311]  Oh, Burma shoes, the one that goes... the tester.
[00:34:38.491 --> 00:34:42.956]  But anyways, just Pepperspray.com, great new sponsor, incredibly low prices.
[00:34:43.256 --> 00:34:44.317]  I thought this was the vapor one.
[00:34:44.337 --> 00:34:47.400]  I just shot inert goo all over the wall over there.
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.182]  Good thing I didn't aim it at him and shoot him.
[00:34:51.164 --> 00:34:51.724]  Oh my gosh.
[00:34:51.784 --> 00:34:56.106]  Anyways, we live in an unpredictable world, and everybody knows I'm all about preparedness.
[00:34:56.166 --> 00:34:59.346]  Remember, announced prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[00:34:59.387 --> 00:35:06.149]  That's why I want you to visit our new sponsor, PepperSpray.com, to check out their wide variety of personal security products they have available on their website since 1994.
[00:35:06.329 --> 00:35:09.389]  They have the lowest prices and the best products we've found anywhere.
[00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:10.130]  Give them a call at 1-800-908-9988.
[00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.330]  That's 800-908-9988.
[00:35:18.132 --> 00:35:21.755]  And, you know, I gripe and complain about police tasering people for no reason.
[00:35:22.776 --> 00:35:24.817]  I'm not against the taser or the firearms themselves.
[00:35:24.897 --> 00:35:27.379]  So, every time I mention this, people go, what do you mean you don't like tasers?
[00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:29.180]  No, I want my wife with a taser.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.602]  You know, it's safer in case somebody got a hold of it.
[00:35:32.803 --> 00:35:36.425]  But it would protect her if somebody was trying to assault her in a parking lot, and crime is certainly up.
[00:35:36.445 --> 00:35:39.007]  They got great deals on tasers, stun guns, you name it.
[00:35:39.027 --> 00:35:42.610]  Pepperspray.com, so be sure and check that out.
[00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:47.494]  Okay, going back to our guest with the book, Family of Secrets.
[00:35:47.534 --> 00:35:51.096]  I'm definitely, Russ, going to have you back on in the near future, just over the phone from New York.
[00:35:51.176 --> 00:35:52.457]  I don't want to wait until you're back in Austin.
[00:35:52.477 --> 00:35:56.560]  This is just too important, just too much information that's got to be gotten out.
[00:35:56.841 --> 00:36:00.664]  Finish up with how they went after Nixon, specifically, and I know that's only a small part of the book.
[00:36:00.984 --> 00:36:06.068]  It's just so interesting to me, and then cover some of the other things that are in the book that you bring up to current times.
[00:36:06.488 --> 00:36:08.549]  Sure, what I see, a number of things.
[00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:21.738]  First of all, I studied the Nixon tapes, and what's very interesting is most of us have not studied the Nixon tapes, and we take the word of several so-called experts, I call them gatekeepers, who tell us that the tapes implicate Nixon.
[00:36:21.978 --> 00:36:23.680]  Well, the tapes don't implicate Nixon.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:35.327]  If you look at the tapes carefully enough, you see that what they show is a guy who's completely befuddled, he has no idea what's going on, he doesn't know why in the world they did that burglary, he says, holy cow, it looks like somebody's trying to set me up.
[00:36:35.647 --> 00:36:36.388]  He does not know
[00:36:36.408 --> 00:36:37.529]  That's right, I've heard that.
[00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:39.390]  Absolutely.
[00:37:07.049 --> 00:37:09.290]  John Dean has a very interesting background.
[00:37:09.531 --> 00:37:13.134]  His brother-in-law and lawyer had CIA connections.
[00:37:13.554 --> 00:37:14.855]  This is very, very important.
[00:37:14.955 --> 00:37:26.965]  And as I say, I think I break new ground here in showing all of these people and their connections to Poppy Bush, who's sitting in the catbird seat of intelligence as the head of the Republican Party at that moment where Nixon is taken down.
[00:37:27.005 --> 00:37:37.251]  And they needed to get Nixon out so the family could finally, at that point, when they decapitated him politically, it would be the Bushes left in total control of the party, to then project themselves into office.
[00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:43.235]  And then he ran against Reagan initially, then they threatened Reagan, so he put George Herbert Walker Bush on the ticket.
[00:37:43.375 --> 00:37:49.678]  Clearly, you have the shooter meeting with the family the night before, all those intelligence connections, getting Reagan under their control.
[00:37:49.718 --> 00:37:50.659]  These are some nasty people.
[00:37:50.979 --> 00:37:59.389]  Well, in fact, you see that they push Agnew out and they bring in Gerald Ford, who had been on the Warren Commission and had always sort of played ball with these guys.
[00:37:59.669 --> 00:38:03.714]  And Gerald Ford then brings in a couple of guys you may have heard of called Cheney and Rumsfeld.
[00:38:05.896 --> 00:38:20.868]  Takeover plan, Rex 84, before it comes out in the 80s, in the Iran-Contra, and it's all about, we'll take over through national security, we'll do a CIA overthrow in the U.S., like we've done in the third world, but in slow motion, and now today it's actually happening, and I have the L.A.
[00:38:20.928 --> 00:38:29.214]  Times, every day I see multiple articles, oh the Marines are running checkpoints to stop drunks, oh the Army was out at the mass shooting, oh there's liaison officers in all the police departments.
[00:38:29.734 --> 00:38:29.934]  L.A.
[00:38:29.995 --> 00:38:31.636]  Times, Marines embedded at L.A.
[00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:32.897]  County Coroner's Office.
[00:38:33.337 --> 00:38:33.837]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:38:33.997 --> 00:38:34.238]  Sure.
[00:38:34.538 --> 00:38:45.583]  In any case, that whole segment, it fascinated me as I dug deeper and deeper, and then of course Ford comes in, as they say, and then they bring in Poppy Bush as the CIA director in 1976.
[00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:55.429]  I then discover a bunch of things that happened to Jimmy Carter, and I get into this in the book, and this appears to be yet another setup of a president they were not happy with.
[00:38:55.469 --> 00:38:59.451]  He was trying to essentially either reorganize or dismantle the CIA.
[00:39:00.051 --> 00:39:08.098]  They make a deal, just on record, they make a deal to have the mullahs grab the hostages, they sell them weapons, I mean, it's Iran-Contra.
[00:39:08.658 --> 00:39:20.108]  There's a lot of interesting stuff about the whole Iran connection, and by the way, right in this period, you see money moving, Iranian money, into companies that George W. Bush is involved with, the son.
[00:39:20.668 --> 00:39:28.435]  So what I do is, the first half or maybe two-thirds of the book is mostly about the father, the grandfather, and this larger apparatus of these
[00:39:28.775 --> 00:39:40.183]  These wealthy and powerful families that influence policy in this country that we really can't talk about, that control resource extraction in this country and around the world, which is the source of power in this world.
[00:39:40.223 --> 00:39:41.945]  You could say it's the entertainment business.
[00:39:42.185 --> 00:39:44.106]  You could say it's a Silicon Valley.
[00:39:44.126 --> 00:39:44.566]  It isn't.
[00:39:44.646 --> 00:39:51.632]  It's always going to be, until the lights go out, it's going to be the things that keep us warm, the things that allow our vehicles to move.
[00:39:52.412 --> 00:39:52.712]  Yeah.
[00:40:10.325 --> 00:40:13.406]  Bring in their people into every White House.
[00:40:13.827 --> 00:40:17.048]  They make sure they have their people in surrounding every president.
[00:40:17.408 --> 00:40:19.449]  And they say, don't think that this thing is going away.
[00:40:19.509 --> 00:40:26.252]  So whatever you think of the new president, whatever you think of what he's trying to do, the reality is that he's limited in his movement.
[00:40:27.873 --> 00:40:28.993]  And he's constrained.
[00:40:29.614 --> 00:40:31.634]  He's got to please the generals.
[00:40:31.674 --> 00:40:33.435]  He's got to please the intelligence community.
[00:40:33.755 --> 00:40:36.997]  And he's got to please all of these interests.
[00:40:37.177 --> 00:40:39.318]  And so I think that the lessons in the book
[00:40:39.918 --> 00:40:41.099]  I think we've got a mailing list.
[00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:57.467]  I hope people have a chance to read the book.
[00:40:58.067 --> 00:40:59.107]  It's a work in progress.
[00:40:59.147 --> 00:41:03.229]  We have a non-profit website called whowhatwhy.com.
[00:41:03.489 --> 00:41:04.809]  We're trying to get this off the ground.
[00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:14.593]  We're looking for the public to support us so that we can put trained investigative journalists with serious credentials on these sorts of stories that the mainstream media will not touch.
[00:41:14.653 --> 00:41:15.793]  Well, you are asking for it.
[00:41:15.813 --> 00:41:16.553]  You've got a lot of courage.
[00:41:16.573 --> 00:41:17.754]  You're a man after my own heart.
[00:41:18.094 --> 00:41:21.835]  In the few minutes we've got left with you, I just want to invite you back in the next few weeks for two hours over the phone.
[00:41:22.075 --> 00:41:22.455]  Be happy.
[00:41:22.495 --> 00:41:23.476]  Because this is so important.
[00:41:24.856 --> 00:41:35.963]  Reading literally hundreds of books, interviewing thousands of guests, trying to find the truth, not left, you know, darkly I look through, not a right-wing darkly I look through, but really trying to find the truth.
[00:41:36.263 --> 00:41:44.429]  It's clear Obama is totally controlled by this very same apparatus, and as much of a nice guy as he might be, it's a bunch of rhetoric.
[00:41:45.229 --> 00:41:46.990]  Uh, that he put out during the campaign.
[00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:56.475]  He's now basically doing the opposite and protecting the Bush family and protecting the President from the crimes, the lies about WMDs, the torture, the police state, all of it.
[00:41:56.515 --> 00:42:07.160]  Can you specifically, because you were just alluding to that, to who is in the Obama administration right now and the fact of however nice we might think Barack Obama is, and I certainly wish everything was okay, but it's not, uh,
[00:42:08.661 --> 00:42:10.122]  Well, I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth.
[00:42:10.142 --> 00:42:14.104]  Basically, where do you stand on Barack Obama and who's in his administration now?
[00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:16.385]  Because it's the very same players from my research.
[00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:20.107]  I want to say, first of all, that I want to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[00:42:20.148 --> 00:42:24.410]  I think it's... I like to give every president the benefit of the doubt.
[00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.911]  I think what he faces is this.
[00:42:26.951 --> 00:42:31.155]  I think he's a man who, as he rose, he understood the art of compromise.
[00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.496]  I think he knew how to play ball with the right people.
[00:42:34.157 --> 00:42:36.338]  I think he's got a mixture of people in his administration.
[00:42:36.379 --> 00:42:38.800]  He's got a few people who I think are very good people.
[00:42:39.101 --> 00:42:43.884]  He's got other people in there who I don't think are so good, and I think there's a lot of jockeying going on.
[00:42:43.924 --> 00:42:54.132]  There's a lot of back and forth, and the question is who's going to prevail on the Wall Street bailout, on the kinds of people he chose to run the Treasury Department,
[00:42:54.292 --> 00:42:54.872]  Well, Obama is not stupid.
[00:42:54.892 --> 00:42:55.513]  He's extremely intelligent.
[00:42:55.553 --> 00:42:58.574]  He knows that if he doesn't deal with the military industrial complex once,
[00:43:23.624 --> 00:43:26.026]  That they're going to destroy him politically or murder him.
[00:43:26.526 --> 00:43:27.827]  And so the proof is in the pudding.
[00:43:27.847 --> 00:43:33.712]  You know, JFK tried to have this mixed cabinet and tried to work with these people and look what happened to him.
[00:43:33.732 --> 00:43:39.016]  So... Well, it's the same thing with Nixon and, you know, they said Nixon was paranoid where he kept replacing people.
[00:43:39.316 --> 00:43:40.577]  That wasn't what it was about.
[00:43:40.877 --> 00:43:42.318]  He was trying to do his own thing.
[00:43:42.338 --> 00:43:47.522]  He had those, you know, back-channel secret negotiations trying to break down the Cold War effectively.
[00:43:47.562 --> 00:43:49.544]  The same thing it turns out Kennedy was trying to do.
[00:43:49.924 --> 00:43:51.866]  And a lot of interests do not want this to happen.
[00:43:51.906 --> 00:43:55.670]  I mean, this country has such a huge military-industrial complex.
[00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:00.014]  It's so much larger, percentage-wise, than any other developed country in the world.
[00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:09.664]  And the amounts being spent and the fortunes being made every day on this stuff, they cannot afford to have a president who presides over global peace.
[00:44:09.804 --> 00:44:12.707]  And so, it is a real challenge for a guy like Obama.
[00:44:13.628 --> 00:44:22.818]  He may be a great guy, he may be an intelligent guy, but the reality is that the President of the United States, no President of the United States, is able to do whatever he wants.
[00:44:22.938 --> 00:44:29.526]  He has got to be realistic about these things, and he's hemmed in to a large extent.
[00:44:31.148 --> 00:44:32.389]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:43.429]  I bought into the propaganda that Nixon was the quintessential devil, until over a decade ago I actually researched what happened to him.
[00:44:43.449 --> 00:44:57.593]  He was obviously a flawed, power-hungry person, but compared to many other presidents, he was actually trying to be the president, and he tried to actually do a lot of good things, and it shows that the shadow government, the national security state, didn't like that.
[00:44:58.013 --> 00:45:00.894]  And so they wanted to make sure that the presidency was a kept position,
[00:45:01.914 --> 00:45:03.835]  And I just feel so sorry for the controlled left.
[00:45:04.115 --> 00:45:08.918]  It's almost like a religious sacrament bashing Nixon in the cartoons and movies and culture.
[00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:16.802]  And it's sad that they're just being completely conned and are missing the real power elite and the real evil.
[00:45:17.283 --> 00:45:24.387]  Yeah, I mean it's unfortunate that people of any ideological stripe are not open to facts, are not open to new information.
[00:45:24.927 --> 00:45:25.667]  And I mean, I think that
[00:45:27.248 --> 00:45:32.493]  The most compelling thing about Family of Secrets, I am told by people, is that I don't come in with an agenda.
[00:45:32.754 --> 00:45:42.003]  And I'm open to being persuaded that what I thought, what I understood, one of my friends, a journalist, when he looked at the book he said, you know what you should call this book?
[00:45:42.523 --> 00:45:45.904]  You should call this book, Everything You Know Is Wrong.
[00:45:46.565 --> 00:45:58.270]  And I was willing to accept the fact that the way that I understood the Kennedy assassination, the way I understood Watergate, the way I understood Jimmy Carter, Ford, George W. Bush, that all of these things were wrong.
[00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:03.492]  And I think what we've got to do is really open up a dialogue in this country where we're willing to just look at these facts.
[00:46:03.832 --> 00:46:06.133]  If somebody wants to come to me and point out that they're wrong,
[00:46:06.593 --> 00:46:07.973]  A few small errors in the book.
[00:46:08.013 --> 00:46:09.474]  People have contacted me about it.
[00:46:09.494 --> 00:46:17.036]  I said somebody went to Yale and he went to Harvard, but nobody has challenged the core, most important facts, the documents that are in there.
[00:46:17.076 --> 00:46:17.397]  That's right.
[00:46:17.417 --> 00:46:24.359]  In my film, The Obama Deception, you know, we get busy and we say Richard M. Haas, head of the CFR, it's Richard M. Haas.
[00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:39.508]  The main facts are accurate and I've done the research and going through the book scanning and everything I see in here is spot-on from deep research that I and many others have done and so you just put it all together in one place instead of in 10 or 15 books so people will get it but
[00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:49.034]  In the final equation, and I cut you off earlier and I want you to finish up with this, you're saying, hey, these people aren't going away.
[00:46:49.415 --> 00:46:50.416]  Specifics on that.
[00:46:50.817 --> 00:46:53.000]  Well, first of all, I think it's kind of funny.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.624]  We like to think that as we live, we do live in a great country.
[00:46:57.305 --> 00:46:59.787]  But we're a little bit naive about thinking that it's perfect.
[00:46:59.967 --> 00:47:02.749]  And we like to think that in this country democracy works.
[00:47:03.149 --> 00:47:06.211]  In every other country, you know, we talk about banana republics.
[00:47:06.251 --> 00:47:13.156]  All these other countries have oligarchies and forces that tend to dominate the political situation.
[00:47:13.216 --> 00:47:16.118]  But it's naive to think that that doesn't happen in this country.
[00:47:16.458 --> 00:47:19.500]  The reason we think it doesn't happen is because you can't talk about it.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.122]  In a weird way, the press self-censors itself.
[00:47:23.483 --> 00:47:25.524]  And so we can't have these conversations.
[00:47:25.604 --> 00:47:27.005]  It's just not okay to talk about it.
[00:47:27.085 --> 00:47:33.291]  We're America and we're the good guys and don't you say we've got a corrupt oligarchy or a shadow government or an elite.
[00:47:33.732 --> 00:47:37.195]  Now they're openly out in the open setting up a classic tyranny.
[00:47:37.215 --> 00:47:46.845]  They've always had the velvet glove on and kind of allowed the common masses to have basic freedoms but now they are eroding and getting rid of that I think because of the internet culture
[00:47:47.225 --> 00:47:52.649]  They know that they've lost their illusion that America's perfect and only good guys are running it.
[00:47:53.769 --> 00:47:56.971]  And so I think we see a massive struggle now coming to a head.
[00:47:56.991 --> 00:48:05.197]  And I'm very optimistic that thanks to books like Family of Secrets and films and things that are out there, that we are starting to turn the corner.
[00:48:05.217 --> 00:48:10.900]  I think that's why we see this thrashing by the establishment, threatening everybody in an attempt to create a chilling effect.
[00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:37.038]  We had in the private fellow reserve rallies all over the country and we got the army document called the army they confirmed it they had the army anti-terrorism squad watching us at all 38 locations including Ron Paul in Houston and I mean that is third world that is Nazi Germany that is Russia and that's happened to peace groups for a long time but now it's much wider and there's secret police all over the place we can't let that show us we've got to have the courage
[00:48:37.738 --> 00:48:41.362]  I agree, and I think that there are some exciting opportunities.
[00:48:41.382 --> 00:48:54.414]  The internet, all of these things, podcasts and so on, the fact that I can come on here and talk about Family of Secrets, I think all of these things, I think the equation is shifting, and I think people that have traditionally held control, certainly the Bushes,
[00:48:54.774 --> 00:48:59.295]  And I go into this to some extent in the book, that the Bushes go way back.
[00:48:59.595 --> 00:49:06.237]  The great-grandfather was working for two different branches of the Rockefeller family at the turn of the 19th century.
[00:49:06.317 --> 00:49:07.797]  I mean, it's mind-blowing stuff.
[00:49:08.077 --> 00:49:12.618]  This continuity of influence and power is absolutely there.
[00:49:12.878 --> 00:49:14.539]  We need to talk about these kinds of things.
[00:49:14.859 --> 00:49:16.159]  We need to assert ourselves.
[00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:18.940]  If we live in a true democracy, we have to be able to
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.322]  To do something about that and have a vigorous debate.
[00:49:22.602 --> 00:49:23.583]  Get the facts out there.
[00:49:23.603 --> 00:49:25.124]  Getting the facts out there, that's the first thing.
[00:49:25.144 --> 00:49:29.387]  Well, we're going to have you back on in a few weeks, if you'll do it, and go through the book in more detail.
[00:49:29.407 --> 00:49:30.087]  But folks, you should get it.
[00:49:30.147 --> 00:49:32.629]  Russ Baker, Family of Secrets.
[00:49:33.269 --> 00:49:34.650]  Just an amazing treatise.
[00:49:35.851 --> 00:49:41.236]  I can't wait to read the whole thing, because everything I scan is just amazing information.
[00:49:41.276 --> 00:49:46.361]  The way it puts it all together in a historical perspective and brings us up to current times.
[00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:48.323]  Fire out both the websites again for folks.
[00:49:48.483 --> 00:49:53.708]  Yeah, I have familyofsecrets.com, information about the book or to contact us.
[00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:59.754]  And then our non-profit investigative reporting site, whowhatwhy.com.
[00:50:00.314 --> 00:50:01.775]  Who, what, why dot com.
[00:50:02.515 --> 00:50:04.937]  We are hoping that the public will support us.
[00:50:04.997 --> 00:50:11.020]  What we eventually want to do is get some thousands of people to support us with a small donation each month.
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.581]  So we get a crack team of investigative reporters there.
[00:50:13.882 --> 00:50:16.383]  We are willing to look at any story, folks.
[00:50:16.643 --> 00:50:21.586]  Anything out there we are willing to investigate using classical journalistic techniques.
[00:50:21.806 --> 00:50:22.966]  That's exciting.
[00:50:22.987 --> 00:50:28.389]  This is the rise of the true alternative media and the establishment is moving to try to regulate the web.
[00:50:28.429 --> 00:50:29.449]  In fact, it's being reported.
[00:50:29.889 --> 00:50:33.551]  YouTube is saying that China has completely blocked YouTube for two days.
[00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:39.533]  And then they have a huge list of countries that have banned most Western-based sites and similar things with Internet, too.
[00:50:39.553 --> 00:50:42.454]  We're now coming in here to end net neutrality and other things.
[00:50:42.495 --> 00:50:48.577]  As the New York Times said, gatekeepers in a kindler, gentler, controlled Internet for our own good.
[00:50:49.017 --> 00:50:49.417]  All right.
[00:50:49.477 --> 00:50:50.918]  Well, again, the book is
[00:50:51.098 --> 00:50:51.901]  Family of Secrets.
[00:50:51.921 --> 00:50:53.265]  Russ Baker, thanks for being with us.
[00:50:53.465 --> 00:50:53.946]  My pleasure.
[00:50:53.967 --> 00:50:54.307]  Thanks, Al.
[00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.416]  We'll be right back with the Mass Graves.
[00:50:57.457 --> 00:50:57.918]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.132 --> 00:51:02.993]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:51:03.133 --> 00:51:09.816]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:51:10.096 --> 00:51:18.260]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:24.203]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:51:24.383 --> 00:51:26.184]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:51:26.224 --> 00:51:28.385]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:51:28.405 --> 00:51:32.787]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:51:32.947 --> 00:51:35.048]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:51:35.168 --> 00:51:43.091]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:51:43.131 --> 00:51:44.392]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[00:52:04.258 --> 00:52:06.383]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:06.884 --> 00:52:13.880]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:20.684]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.044 --> 00:52:22.885]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.025 --> 00:52:25.446]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:52:25.527 --> 00:52:36.473]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.114 --> 00:52:38.375]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.776 --> 00:52:40.157]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:40.618 --> 00:52:46.964]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.545 --> 00:52:55.332]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.813 --> 00:52:56.954]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:58.576]  The people strike back.
[00:53:01.306 --> 00:53:07.370]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:13.475]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:53:13.895 --> 00:53:19.179]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:53:19.639 --> 00:53:21.720]  Starve or surrender.
[00:53:22.081 --> 00:53:25.923]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:53:26.404 --> 00:53:27.304]  What then?
[00:53:29.998 --> 00:53:32.820]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:37.263]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:53:37.403 --> 00:53:40.225]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscum.
[00:53:40.285 --> 00:53:47.330]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:49.292]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:53:49.412 --> 00:53:54.796]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.

[00:53:57.538 --> 00:53:58.338]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:54:02.085 --> 00:54:02.386]  Yeah.
[00:54:07.833 --> 00:54:16.535]  Well, for the next 20 minutes, we're going to have a very brave person, Shepard Ambaless, joining us from Arizona.
[00:54:16.555 --> 00:54:20.036]  The story is military industrial complex prepares mass graves for U.S.
[00:54:20.076 --> 00:54:20.496]  citizens.
[00:54:20.516 --> 00:54:26.898]  We're getting all these emails pouring in from around the country saying, hey, they've got these in my town, Abilene and other areas.
[00:54:26.918 --> 00:54:29.479]  And it goes with all the plastic FEMA coffins.
[00:54:30.119 --> 00:54:33.820]  Other reports that have been in the news, whether in Indiana, Illinois,
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.761]  FEMA says we need to prepare for mass graves.
[00:54:36.821 --> 00:54:37.582]  Is it for bird flu?
[00:54:37.602 --> 00:54:39.083]  Are they getting ready for World War III?
[00:54:39.783 --> 00:54:46.027]  This is being set up at a military cemetery in Phoenix.
[00:54:46.487 --> 00:54:47.808]  Let's go ahead and bring the man up.
[00:54:47.848 --> 00:54:49.709]  He's been out there taking photos and interviewing people.
[00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:54.052]  We've been putting calls in all day to the head of the cemetery.
[00:54:54.092 --> 00:54:55.613]  He hasn't called us back yet.
[00:54:56.234 --> 00:54:59.916]  But let's go ahead and go to Shepard Ambilis.
[00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:01.517]  Shepard, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:02.910]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:55:03.191 --> 00:55:03.931]  I appreciate it.
[00:55:04.031 --> 00:55:04.611]  How's it going?
[00:55:05.132 --> 00:55:05.432]  Good.
[00:55:05.452 --> 00:55:07.913]  Tell us how you first discovered this.
[00:55:08.154 --> 00:55:08.974]  What's going on there?
[00:55:08.994 --> 00:55:09.835]  We have the photos.
[00:55:09.875 --> 00:55:11.335]  We have the satellite photos.
[00:55:12.296 --> 00:55:16.439]  I mean, you caught them doing this deep into their operation.
[00:55:16.459 --> 00:55:19.140]  There's a bunch of other areas where they buried these crypts.
[00:55:20.021 --> 00:55:21.342]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:55:21.682 --> 00:55:24.163]  Well, my friend alerted me to this originally.
[00:55:24.864 --> 00:55:27.085]  And, you know, he said, what do you make of this?
[00:55:27.505 --> 00:55:31.308]  And I told him right away, you know, I'm familiar with the FEMA coffins.
[00:55:32.555 --> 00:55:37.178]  Also, some concrete caskets in a cemetery in L.A.
[00:55:38.198 --> 00:55:42.761]  and basically we went over and investigated it, took some pictures.
[00:55:44.922 --> 00:55:53.307]  One of my friends ended up interviewing a truck driver that was part of the operation and basically gathered from the truck driver.
[00:55:53.648 --> 00:56:00.552]  After about 10 minutes of the truck driver kind of beating around the bush, he basically said, you know, look, these are four
[00:56:01.579 --> 00:56:01.859]  U.S.
[00:56:01.899 --> 00:56:10.183]  military and four caskets fit in each one of these burial vaults.
[00:56:12.224 --> 00:56:19.367]  Basically went on to say he got paid an awful lot of money to do his job.
[00:56:20.407 --> 00:56:23.368]  Sounds like a little bit of a bribe to me.
[00:56:23.468 --> 00:56:26.430]  I just want to explain to people, then we're going to pick your brain on this.
[00:56:27.546 --> 00:56:32.489]  Explain to folks, this is the way regular military cemeteries work.
[00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:36.791]  It's one coffin, one crypt, and then there's space around the graves.
[00:56:37.591 --> 00:56:40.012]  They're going in, digging in ten feet, as you said.
[00:56:40.033 --> 00:56:44.195]  We have the photos of this, putting in all of these crypts right up against each other.
[00:56:45.375 --> 00:56:47.076]  I guess this wouldn't be properly Mark Graves.
[00:56:47.096 --> 00:56:49.458]  This is not the way it's ever been done.
[00:56:49.838 --> 00:56:52.140]  And they're doing it at night, which is very, very secretive.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:59.925]  And then it dovetails in with the FEMA plastic coffins all over the country, Georgia and other areas, confirmed from the company that sold it to FEMA.
[00:57:00.465 --> 00:57:02.326]  Centers for Disease Control massing these.
[00:57:02.747 --> 00:57:06.429]  I mean, this is like 28 days later or something.
[00:57:06.449 --> 00:57:07.410]  This is very frightening.
[00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:08.831]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:12.991]  You know, this is, I kind of got this to you guys a little bit late.
[00:57:13.011 --> 00:57:15.792]  I've been working on this, but, uh, absolutely.
[00:57:15.812 --> 00:57:18.673]  They've been working on it over the last 30 plus days.
[00:57:19.253 --> 00:57:21.134]  Uh, it's a large scale operation.
[00:57:21.154 --> 00:57:28.856]  I mean, semi-trucks literally every morning, uh, you know, they start during, uh, it's still dark, you know, they start real early.
[00:57:29.236 --> 00:57:38.839]  Then they start lining up, uh, literally bringing these things in and just unloading them all day long, uh, stacking them in tightly together.
[00:57:39.575 --> 00:57:56.465]  Uh, the interesting observation I made was, uh, they actually went ahead and laid down, uh, what's called ABC or, or some kind of, uh, rock that, you know, probably one to two inches in diameter, uh, on the whole base of this thing.
[00:57:57.205 --> 00:58:01.347]  And now I've done a little bit of research about mass graze in Germany and whatnot.
[00:58:01.388 --> 00:58:07.391]  And I thought this could be, uh, you know, aid with the D decomposition process, but
[00:58:08.001 --> 00:58:15.215]  Basically is what I'm thinking is that some kind of drainage system or bedding that was installed.
[00:58:15.255 --> 00:58:18.421]  Now stay there and I wasn't criticizing you for getting into the project late.
[00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.104]  I meant you discovered it.
[00:58:20.945 --> 00:58:22.106]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:22.126 --> 00:58:22.646]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.506 --> 00:58:52.068]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.188 --> 00:58:56.775]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:56.935 --> 00:58:59.679]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:58:59.899 --> 00:59:02.763]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:02.943 --> 00:59:07.670]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:08.811]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:11.974]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.234 --> 00:59:19.140]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.383]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:22.523 --> 00:59:22.724]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:22.784 --> 00:59:24.065]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:27.668 --> 00:59:33.734]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[00:59:40.862 --> 00:59:45.106]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:45.287 --> 00:59:46.248]  Take action today.
[00:59:46.428 --> 00:59:48.210]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.337 --> 00:59:55.239]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.719 --> 00:59:58.641]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.308 --> 01:00:09.389]  Jason Douglas just got news.
[01:00:09.449 --> 01:00:17.876]  He just talked to Ellis, the director of the Phoenix Department of Veterans Affairs National Memorial Cemetery in Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:00:17.896 --> 01:00:18.876]  225 acre facility.
[01:00:22.034 --> 01:00:23.636]  We know how they dig the graves.
[01:00:23.656 --> 01:00:24.958]  They're single-person crypts.
[01:00:26.519 --> 01:00:27.921]  They put the coffins in.
[01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:28.682]  There's space.
[01:00:28.702 --> 01:00:29.843]  You've seen Arlington Cemetery.
[01:00:29.863 --> 01:00:30.364]  You've seen it all.
[01:00:30.684 --> 01:00:31.766]  These are being buried.
[01:00:32.427 --> 01:00:33.107]  They never do that.
[01:00:33.207 --> 01:00:34.549]  Beforehand, covered up.
[01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:39.956]  And they're then setting them right next to each other.
[01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:45.209]  And these are crypts that can hold four coffins, or if you don't put people in coffins, it can hold even more than that.
[01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:50.654]  And our guest has done the math on this, Shepard Ambaless.
[01:00:51.695 --> 01:01:01.323]  And Shepard, we're going to go to you in just a moment, but I wanted to go to Jason Douglas, who does graphics, video editing, and producing for the Jason Burma Show and this show, along with Rob Due, doing a great job.
[01:01:01.543 --> 01:01:06.507]  You finally got a hold of the director of the National Memorial Cemetery there in Phoenix.
[01:01:06.547 --> 01:01:07.168]  What did he tell you?
[01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:17.235]  Uh, well, he basically just said that this is completely commonplace, that they dig these graves ahead of time, they only get two days' notice once they know who's going to be interred.
[01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:26.355]  But I asked him if he could comment on who was actually going to be put into those graves, or if he knew anything about the content of the graves.
[01:01:26.915 --> 01:01:28.376]  He wouldn't make a comment on that.
[01:01:28.456 --> 01:01:31.198]  He seemed like he had this pretty well-prepared speech.
[01:01:31.278 --> 01:01:36.020]  He didn't... That's just... I mean, it's just normal to have 4,000 graves.
[01:01:36.521 --> 01:01:38.061]  Just what we can count on the surface.
[01:01:38.081 --> 01:01:39.022]  That's supposedly normal.
[01:01:39.102 --> 01:01:39.302]  Right.
[01:01:39.322 --> 01:01:40.083]  Supposedly normal.
[01:01:40.123 --> 01:01:41.684]  He said everything was above board.
[01:01:41.724 --> 01:01:44.805]  I mean, supposedly only 4,500 troops have died in Iraq.
[01:01:45.806 --> 01:01:47.587]  So, I mean, suddenly they just need all these graves.
[01:01:47.907 --> 01:01:48.768]  Yeah.
[01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:52.110]  And we're getting reports they're building these at military cemeteries everywhere.
[01:01:52.591 --> 01:01:52.771]  Right.
[01:01:52.911 --> 01:01:54.932]  Yeah, we've also had reports in Abilene, Texas.
[01:01:55.313 --> 01:01:58.575]  We're asking people to write in online.
[01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:02.318]  I've posted some videos and shown the pictures online.
[01:02:02.798 --> 01:02:06.281]  People are making comments, so hopefully we'll get some more reports of other mass graves.
[01:02:07.096 --> 01:02:12.921]  Yeah, because if we find more and confirm it, and it goes into the tens of thousands, going back to Shepard.
[01:02:12.941 --> 01:02:23.269]  Shepard, you did some math here, and you talked to some of the construction workers there, some of the excavators, about how many people can fit in just the graves that you saw, just the crypts that you saw.
[01:02:24.269 --> 01:02:24.810]  Absolutely.
[01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:33.977]  Well, like you said, we know that according to what the official reports are, which are obviously a little bit skewed, but they're reporting, you know, like 4,500 troops of
[01:02:35.768 --> 01:02:37.309]  Died in Iraq and whatnot.
[01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:47.076]  It's highly suspect that you got grazed enough here for 4,000 people just in Arizona.
[01:02:49.137 --> 01:02:54.401]  If caskets weren't used in these graves, you could probably fit 30 to 40 bodies in each one.
[01:02:55.802 --> 01:03:02.327]  So if you run the math times that by at least 1,000 that I know are there, you have anywhere from
[01:03:03.323 --> 01:03:07.627]  4,000 bodies to possibly 40,000 bodies just in this one location.
[01:03:07.707 --> 01:03:11.351]  And then what are the millions of FEMA coffins all over the country?
[01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:14.534]  A couple hundred thousand just in Georgia alone at one site.
[01:03:14.574 --> 01:03:20.980]  And then we go up, there's the name of the company, you call them, it is a plastic casket, and they're just staging them for the CDC.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.461]  That's obviously for mass plague.
[01:03:22.722 --> 01:03:24.763]  And then we've had government officials on,
[01:03:27.006 --> 01:03:32.532]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:03:32.572 --> 01:03:40.201]  And let me tell you, also Alex, there's a video that surfaced from another plastic company.
[01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:45.286]  I can't think of the name of it offhand, but you could probably find it on YouTube.
[01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:50.134]  It happened to be in Canada, just north of the Washington border.
[01:04:01.289 --> 01:04:03.131]  It's six, seven years ago, so it's hard to find.
[01:04:03.611 --> 01:04:13.881]  Headline, Rocky Mountain News, Governor discusses, or Governor says, mass incinerators and graves ready for 15,000 a day, I think is the headline.
[01:04:13.921 --> 01:04:15.282]  I mean, I read that on air.
[01:04:15.342 --> 01:04:16.163]  We need to find that.
[01:04:16.223 --> 01:04:16.503]  Go ahead.
[01:04:17.264 --> 01:04:20.266]  Yeah, and you know, like I said, this is just kind of suspect.
[01:04:20.307 --> 01:04:22.669]  I have a feeling it's going on all around the country.
[01:04:23.433 --> 01:04:30.075]  You know, this is where we need to call for the listeners to really do some investigative research and let's see where these things are turning up.
[01:04:31.216 --> 01:04:37.098]  Because if there is a big terror attack or something, a bird flu or a nuke, how come they were getting all these graves ready?
[01:04:37.758 --> 01:04:40.339]  Yes, and another point I have is...
[01:04:41.756 --> 01:04:47.439]  Actually, if we could track down the locations of these, if they're all over, then we kind of know that they're setting up for something.
[01:04:47.499 --> 01:04:51.542]  If they're just in certain locations, you know, what's that mean as well?
[01:04:51.882 --> 01:04:52.342]  Stay there.
[01:04:52.382 --> 01:04:55.644]  More key questions and answers on the other side.
[01:04:55.704 --> 01:04:57.365]  And Webster-Tarpley, stay with us.
[01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:04.062]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:05:04.302 --> 01:05:08.648]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:05:08.849 --> 01:05:16.720]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:05:17.028 --> 01:05:19.869]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:27.673]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:05:27.773 --> 01:05:33.356]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:39.161]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:05:39.441 --> 01:05:42.744]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:05:42.985 --> 01:05:46.348]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:51.632]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:05:51.652 --> 01:05:54.515]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:05:54.535 --> 01:05:54.735]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:06:00.945 --> 01:06:06.250]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:13.756]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:20.531]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:22.751]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:22.891 --> 01:06:25.312]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:25.392 --> 01:06:36.335]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:38.255]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:38.636 --> 01:06:39.996]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:40.504 --> 01:06:46.852]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:06:55.682 --> 01:06:56.824]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.244 --> 01:06:58.446]  The people strike back.
[01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:03.254]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:07:03.415 --> 01:07:08.677]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:07:08.937 --> 01:07:14.280]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:15.780]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.141 --> 01:07:25.045]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:07:25.445 --> 01:07:27.087]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[01:07:27.287 --> 01:07:31.472]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:55.051]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:08:02.173 --> 01:08:08.200]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:11.785]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.342 --> 01:08:20.926]  Shepard Ambaless is our guest who took the photos and wrote the story that we broke at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:20.946 --> 01:08:23.608]  We appreciate him giving us that information.
[01:08:23.888 --> 01:08:34.115]  Send any other photos of mass graves, plastic coffin liners being massed, mainstream news articles where they say they're getting ready for all of this.
[01:08:34.135 --> 01:08:37.157]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:08:37.197 --> 01:08:39.939]  Continuing, Shepard, with other points that need to be made here.
[01:08:40.953 --> 01:08:47.637]  Well, uh, you know, uh, another thing that's noted is, you know, just the, the sheer size of the operation.
[01:08:48.017 --> 01:09:01.964]  There's, there's several of these sections that were visible, uh, to me over the last 30 days that I know they've already covered up multiple sections, uh, and they've already put the earth over it and it, and it looks just like nothing's there.
[01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:05.406]  There was about three of these sections exposed, um,
[01:09:06.055 --> 01:09:14.462]  You know, I would estimate that the sections are like something around like 800 or 1000 feet by 1000 feet just packed in there.
[01:09:15.482 --> 01:09:18.745]  The way they were excavated is just perfect cut.
[01:09:19.352 --> 01:09:20.853]  Uh, down a straight wall.
[01:09:20.893 --> 01:09:28.457]  I mean, everything's just to a T. Um, it's obviously... Now, that's not how they build National Cemetery graves.
[01:09:29.177 --> 01:09:35.020]  They're single, they're single coffins or crypts, and they have space in between the little white crosses.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:38.181]  I mean, this is, this is just unbelievable.
[01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:41.523]  And, and going back, uh, to Jason Douglas.
[01:09:41.563 --> 01:09:43.324]  Jason, again, you talked to the director of it.
[01:09:43.344 --> 01:09:45.425]  Uh, you said it sounded like it was all prepared.
[01:09:46.418 --> 01:09:50.882]  He just didn't seem like it was out of the ordinary that I was asking these questions at all.
[01:09:51.742 --> 01:09:53.764]  It definitely seemed like a prepared statement.
[01:09:56.146 --> 01:09:57.987]  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.
[01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:01.009]  And, you know, obviously they're gearing up for something.
[01:10:01.349 --> 01:10:03.031]  We know what the New World Order's up to.
[01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:08.695]  And, you know, thanks to shows like the Alex Jones Show, you know, everything's starting to get exposed.
[01:10:08.795 --> 01:10:13.659]  And hopefully these criminals won't be able to continue with their plan.
[01:10:14.522 --> 01:10:15.883]  Now we're looking at some video here.
[01:10:15.903 --> 01:10:17.104]  I know this video was coming in.
[01:10:17.224 --> 01:10:24.150]  Is this... Is this... Oh, this is trucks delivering coffins.
[01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:27.112]  Or is this Shepard's video?
[01:10:27.892 --> 01:10:29.293]  What is this we're putting on screen right now?
[01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:31.896]  Okay, RobDude just sent it to us.
[01:10:32.036 --> 01:10:36.659]  Yeah, this is the... Is this the video you sent us?
[01:10:36.719 --> 01:10:38.801]  That's probably my video, Alex.
[01:10:38.861 --> 01:10:39.341]  That's...
[01:10:40.626 --> 01:10:44.248]  The first footage I had, we were just driving around through there.
[01:10:44.268 --> 01:10:45.189]  No, it's good.
[01:10:45.209 --> 01:10:47.690]  This is great footage.
[01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:48.791]  I don't apologize for anything.
[01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:49.611]  You're doing a great job.
[01:10:49.651 --> 01:10:54.774]  Now we now see the mass graves side-by-side the containers.
[01:10:55.435 --> 01:10:56.615]  This is just incredible.
[01:10:56.955 --> 01:10:58.156]  Please continue with any other points.
[01:11:00.337 --> 01:11:04.940]  I've seen numbers spray-painted on these things up to like 800.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.383]  Obviously, there's over a thousand, like I said.
[01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:16.336]  You know, um, also, you know, it just, it's, I wanted to let you know something.
[01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:19.116]  When I went to, you know, I'm highly aware of the new world order.
[01:11:19.136 --> 01:11:20.477]  I listen to your show every day.
[01:11:20.497 --> 01:11:29.358]  Um, you know, you're a big inspiration for me, uh, being conditioned to all this and then going and actually filming it.
[01:11:29.898 --> 01:11:39.320]  I wanted the listeners to know that when I was actually filming it, uh, afterwards, I actually threw up because it was so gut wrenching.
[01:11:40.289 --> 01:11:44.131]  Just to know what they're up to.
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:09.882]  But the old man going, around me, this was religious rapture and it was a horrible vibe.
[01:12:10.382 --> 01:12:14.063]  And I know what you're talking about, just to realize, my God, there's things I didn't know about in this world.
[01:12:14.103 --> 01:12:16.164]  This world is a lot stranger than people know.
[01:12:16.964 --> 01:12:17.885]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:12:18.305 --> 01:12:21.366]  Yes, that's true.
[01:12:21.466 --> 01:12:25.467]  I mean, it just really hit me hard and I decided, you know, I gotta expose this.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:40.986]  You know, I'm working on another story, and I'll let you guys know as soon as I get more done, but this other thing is even more compelling than that, and I hope to get that to you guys as well.
[01:12:42.027 --> 01:12:44.348]  Oh man, now you've really picked my interest.
[01:12:44.368 --> 01:12:45.108]  Can you give us a hint?
[01:12:45.968 --> 01:12:49.390]  Well, let's just say it has to do with United States Post Offices.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.701]  Well, we know those are going to be used as mass inoculation centers.
[01:12:53.741 --> 01:12:54.821]  That's been in mainstream news.
[01:12:54.841 --> 01:12:55.662]  Is that what it deals with?
[01:12:56.402 --> 01:12:57.122]  Absolutely.
[01:12:57.402 --> 01:13:01.324]  And, you know, let me just give you a little hint.
[01:13:02.084 --> 01:13:04.565]  Our listeners can go around and check this out for themselves.
[01:13:04.645 --> 01:13:10.127]  I've been checking out various post offices in the Phoenix metro area.
[01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:11.587]  And let me tell you something.
[01:13:11.707 --> 01:13:13.528]  I came up with some startling discoveries.
[01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:20.200]  The barbed wire fences on these post offices point inward, just like concentration camps.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:27.324]  Well, that's what Congress has admitted, is that they'll use existing federal locations, and they'll use Walmart distribution centers as FEMA camps.
[01:13:27.364 --> 01:13:28.745]  That's come out in mainstream news.
[01:13:29.385 --> 01:13:32.027]  We reported it back when it was secret, and then a few years later it came out.
[01:13:32.067 --> 01:13:35.689]  Oh, they're prepared for mass inoculations, and this will be a staging area for you.
[01:13:35.729 --> 01:13:39.010]  And now they admit, oh, we've got FEMA camps, but it's to take care of you.
[01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:39.611]  We love you.
[01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:42.572]  And then, I mean, look at this article.
[01:13:42.632 --> 01:13:44.994]  Marines embedded at LA County Coroner's Office.
[01:13:45.014 --> 01:13:48.157]  See, it's always, oh, they're helping at drunk driver checkpoints in Southern California.
[01:13:48.297 --> 01:13:49.358]  Oh, there was a mass shooting.
[01:13:49.378 --> 01:13:50.519]  The Army was there helping.
[01:13:50.579 --> 01:13:51.220]  Regular Army.
[01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:55.284]  Oh, they're taking over the public schools and making them military academies.
[01:13:55.925 --> 01:13:57.686]  Oh, it says the Marines are going to be embedded.
[01:13:58.567 --> 01:13:59.967]  In groups, in the L.A.
[01:14:00.007 --> 01:14:02.828]  County Coroner's Office, but just to learn about dead bodies.
[01:14:03.268 --> 01:14:07.029]  See, it's just, oh, they're just liaison officers in the police intelligence bureaus.
[01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:10.310]  What is it like, Jason, since you've been working here a few months?
[01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:18.232]  Because, I mean, you weren't too aware of the work we did here, or I guess you were somewhat, I forget, but the point is, is it now really living it where you see it every day?
[01:14:18.252 --> 01:14:19.813]  I mean, we're not making this up, are we?
[01:14:20.549 --> 01:14:21.850]  No, none of this is made up.
[01:14:21.951 --> 01:14:34.985]  It's just crazy to see, because you hear one isolated story, maybe two isolated stories, but when you start seeing the master plan forming together, that's when things really take shape and you realize, you know, this isn't normal.
[01:14:35.225 --> 01:14:38.388]  And every time you talk to someone, that's all they want to play off.
[01:14:38.428 --> 01:14:39.770]  This is absolutely normal.
[01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:41.392]  We do this all the time.
[01:14:42.455 --> 01:14:45.798]  Yeah, I mean, the armies in Iowa are going to do a door-to-door gun confiscation drill.
[01:14:45.818 --> 01:14:46.679]  The citizens are happy.
[01:14:46.699 --> 01:14:50.382]  We're going to practice locking the town of Arcadia down and going after guns.
[01:14:50.442 --> 01:14:56.207]  I mean, and the governor of Illinois announced the military is going to do gun sweeps door-to-door all over the state.
[01:14:56.247 --> 01:14:56.808]  It's normal.
[01:14:56.908 --> 01:15:03.314]  I mean, you know, oh yeah, you know, the Phoenix newspaper admits the police say we're ready to work with the troops against the American people.
[01:15:03.814 --> 01:15:05.535]  You know, that was in the Phoenix Business Journal.
[01:15:05.575 --> 01:15:07.016]  It's just hundreds of these reports.
[01:15:07.056 --> 01:15:10.278]  And the Army War College says, our new mission is fighting the American people.
[01:15:10.838 --> 01:15:13.359]  Meanwhile, in the nightly news, it's, the troops are going to fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:13.379 --> 01:15:14.840]  The troops will be on the streets to fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.882]  Or they introduce Obama's takeover as, oh, soup kitchens.
[01:15:17.902 --> 01:15:19.503]  Then you read the thing, it says law enforcement.
[01:15:20.063 --> 01:15:21.524]  You know, seven million person army.
[01:15:23.165 --> 01:15:26.266]  Jason Douglas, thank you for being with us and thank you for working on this report.
[01:15:27.007 --> 01:15:27.667]  It was great having you here.
[01:15:27.687 --> 01:15:27.967]  Thank you.
[01:15:28.648 --> 01:15:28.988]  You bet.
[01:15:29.648 --> 01:15:32.070]  And I want to thank you for what you're doing, Shepard.
[01:15:33.717 --> 01:15:34.037]  Not really.
[01:15:34.057 --> 01:15:35.258]  I encourage the listeners to
[01:15:52.011 --> 01:15:57.157]  Do a little bit of investigating in their local areas, and let's see what we can come up with.
[01:15:57.217 --> 01:16:05.367]  And I'd like to give out an email address if I could, so people could also forward tips or information to me on this subject.
[01:16:06.848 --> 01:16:07.830]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:09.011]  We'll talk to you in the near future.
[01:16:09.051 --> 01:16:09.431]  Be safe.
[01:16:10.276 --> 01:16:15.502]  Okay, I apologize to Webster Tarpley for getting him on fifteen minutes late.
[01:16:15.522 --> 01:16:22.431]  I always appreciate him coming on the show every few weeks to break down the latest Obama activities.
[01:16:22.471 --> 01:16:27.196]  You know, a year ago plus when Tarpley, who I really respect as a historian and researcher,
[01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:36.599]  Pioneering researchers said Obama is going to totally roll out with national drafts and youth squads and a private army immediately.
[01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:39.363]  I was like, yeah, I know they want to do that, but it's going to be hard.
[01:16:39.823 --> 01:16:45.149]  And when he talked about how they were going to hype things up with Russia and move troops in, I was like, oh, come on, and it happened.
[01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:54.395]  You know, he said, months before 888, he said, Brzezinski and the Obama people are already in control of the Bush administration, they're going to attack Russia, and it happened.
[01:16:54.895 --> 01:17:07.082]  You know, all of this, and now they've passed in the House and Senate, they've got to bring it into conference now and complete it, but it's been passing by, you know, two-thirds majorities, you know, 300 plus to 175 to 14, or 74 to 14 in the Senate, and it says compulsory service, I mean, and then
[01:17:13.106 --> 01:17:16.829]  When it's in the New York Times, they just say, oh, expanding AmeriCorps, like it's no big deal.
[01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:18.811]  You've got to go read the bill to find this out.
[01:17:20.633 --> 01:17:23.415]  They're openly announcing trillions more for the bankers.
[01:17:23.535 --> 01:17:27.679]  A bank of the world will pay our carbon taxes to everything Tarpley, who's the main figure.
[01:17:27.699 --> 01:17:33.925]  You know, there's Jesse Ventura and KRS-One and Professor Griff and George Humphrey and
[01:17:34.745 --> 01:17:35.606]  I don't know.
[01:18:05.506 --> 01:18:09.749]  Comment on what's currently happening, and where you see this going in the future.
[01:18:10.489 --> 01:18:14.212]  Well, let me say first of all, I have to congratulate you for the Obama deception.
[01:18:14.252 --> 01:18:18.195]  You and your team have put together what is nothing short of a masterpiece.
[01:18:18.315 --> 01:18:24.439]  It's the best political documentary to come out of the United States in many years, maybe many decades.
[01:18:24.579 --> 01:18:28.242]  And I say that having seen quite a few of them.
[01:18:29.461 --> 01:18:41.190]  It is a tremendous piece of work, and I think it's just what was needed to crystallize a kind of vague unease that a lot of people have who don't really follow politics or economics.
[01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:52.018]  But it's a tremendous achievement, and if it's gone viral, then more power to you, and that's a big turning point, because we're, what are we, about two-thirds of the way through the 100 days.
[01:18:52.679 --> 01:18:55.741]  I think the key thing with Obama is to checkmate him.
[01:18:55.801 --> 01:18:57.022]  It's to stop him, right?
[01:18:57.182 --> 01:18:58.003]  To bog him down.
[01:18:58.686 --> 01:19:05.169]  Don't let him get this cap-and-trade, a tax of $700 billion on production, because that's what this comes down to.
[01:19:05.529 --> 01:19:20.775]  Cap-and-trade means we're going to let the financiers run wild, but we're going to impose this extra burden on any kind of production, any farmer who runs a tractor, anybody who commutes to work, the whole realm of physical economy, as distinct from the crazy paper world.
[01:19:20.855 --> 01:19:26.577]  Yeah, this is the paper casino economy, waging war on what's left of the real economy.
[01:19:27.048 --> 01:19:34.955]  Right, it's Count Dracula draining your blood so that the derivatives can live and any kind of production, and therefore human life, can die.
[01:19:35.075 --> 01:19:36.616]  So we've got that entire thing.
[01:19:36.656 --> 01:19:46.664]  And then, of course, we've got this sort of fascistoid or neo-fascist compulsory labor corps and national service, as they call it.
[01:19:46.724 --> 01:19:47.485]  National service.
[01:19:47.967 --> 01:19:56.531]  For the sake of Wall Street, is that, that's who you're gonna be, uh... Now, stay there, and we pay our carbon taxes, now admitted in hundreds of papers, to the bankers who engineered all this.
[01:19:56.891 --> 01:19:58.152]  Webster Tarpley, stay there.
[01:19:58.632 --> 01:19:59.833]  Obama's starting to bog down.
[01:20:00.733 --> 01:20:01.914]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:20:02.094 --> 01:20:08.497]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:20:08.657 --> 01:20:10.998]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't
[01:20:15.404 --> 01:20:24.591]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:20:24.811 --> 01:20:30.956]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:20:31.196 --> 01:20:34.599]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[01:20:34.799 --> 01:20:39.002]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:40.483]  For the rest of you, go to eFoods.com.
[01:20:44.517 --> 01:20:47.199]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.177 --> 01:21:12.540]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.041 --> 01:21:19.244]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:19.465 --> 01:21:21.366]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:21.526 --> 01:21:23.907]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:23.987 --> 01:21:34.874]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:37.145 --> 01:21:38.406]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:40.228]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:40.689 --> 01:21:47.036]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:47.596 --> 01:21:55.384]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:55.865 --> 01:21:57.006]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.446 --> 01:21:58.628]  The people strike back.
[01:22:00.103 --> 01:22:00.463]  Good day.
[01:22:00.663 --> 01:22:02.204]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:02.445 --> 01:22:02.665]  March 25, 2009.
[01:22:02.725 --> 01:22:03.345]  Gold opened at $921.70.
[01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:06.627]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $948.29, $474.15 for the half-ounce, and $237.27 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:07.228]  That's $948.29, $474.15, and $237.27.
[01:22:18.573 --> 01:22:32.107]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:22:32.207 --> 01:22:33.168]  Is this capitalism?
[01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:40.796]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:41.016 --> 01:22:41.997]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:42.117 --> 01:22:46.281]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:22:46.481 --> 01:22:47.562]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.582 --> 01:22:48.543]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:48.703]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.723 --> 01:22:48.944]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:50.225]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:23:03.522 --> 01:23:06.504]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:23:06.864 --> 01:23:10.286]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:23:10.646 --> 01:23:16.830]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:22.273]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:23:22.433 --> 01:23:29.157]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:23:29.457 --> 01:23:30.338]  Need something more?
[01:23:30.558 --> 01:23:34.202]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[01:23:34.502 --> 01:23:42.570]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:47.155]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[01:23:47.335 --> 01:23:49.076]  Alright, Webster Tartley's our guest.
[01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:20.427]  When you get the Obama Deception, InfoWars.com.
[01:24:20.447 --> 01:24:25.151]  We've got both his books on Obama for sale with it, discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:25.171 --> 01:24:27.893]  When you call his toll-free number, be sure and ask about those discounts.
[01:24:27.913 --> 01:24:29.614]  You can get those there as well in the combo.
[01:24:29.634 --> 01:24:29.674]  888-253-3139.
[01:24:29.694 --> 01:24:31.235]  You see, if you attack
[01:24:35.919 --> 01:24:40.141]  Obama, from a right-wing perspective, Rush Limbaugh stuff, that's all discredited.
[01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:43.843]  That actually makes his supporters support him more in the false left-right paradigm.
[01:24:43.863 --> 01:24:51.386]  But if you go after him as an elitist, notice he always frames himself as he's fighting Wall Street, he's fighting corruption, he's fighting special interests.
[01:24:51.406 --> 01:24:59.370]  He needs his 13 million goons and a 7 million army, that's now in the New York Times, to go out and intimidate Congress and the governors and the states.
[01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:04.713]  And we see, depending on the poll, 15 to 22 point drops now in the first two months
[01:25:05.373 --> 01:25:09.475]  Well, Obama met with the Washington Post editorial board on the Thursday before the inauguration and he said,
[01:25:35.792 --> 01:25:39.614]  The slogans now are going to be sacrifice, duty, and responsibility.
[01:25:39.674 --> 01:25:54.921]  And that means that you, as an individual, are required to sacrifice your health care, your economic rights, to prop up 1.5 quadrillion derivatives bubble, and to keep these zombie bankers in business.
[01:25:55.001 --> 01:25:56.701]  I mean, you look at Wall Street, right?
[01:25:57.002 --> 01:26:04.405]  You've got Blank Fine of Goldman Sachs, Pandit of Citibank, Diamond of JPMorgan Chase, Lewis of Bank of America, Mack
[01:26:04.918 --> 01:26:05.718]  of Morgan Stanley.
[01:26:05.758 --> 01:26:06.658]  Those are the big five.
[01:26:07.099 --> 01:26:13.860]  And they've got a very large part of the world derivatives bubble, the derivatives black hole.
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:29.524]  And if you're going to slap a $660 billion tax on production, because that's what it means, or even just a lawnmower, a car, anything that you're going to drive, your commute, that's going to go directly to these leeches.
[01:26:30.839 --> 01:26:31.960]  And Lampreys and Wall Street.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.144]  Those are, by the way, the same people who bid up the price of gas last summer.
[01:26:36.184 --> 01:26:43.291]  When gas was at $4.50 to $5, you were paying $1 to Blank Fine of Goldman Sachs and Mack of Morgan Stanley.
[01:26:43.351 --> 01:26:47.134]  Just the two of them were getting a dollar for every gallon that you were buying.
[01:26:47.154 --> 01:26:48.956]  So now we've got cap and trade.
[01:26:49.016 --> 01:26:56.123]  Now, a lot of people have noted this has been one of the most severe winters in the Northern Hemisphere in a long time, but these fanatics are undeterred.
[01:26:56.618 --> 01:27:00.540]  These are Malthusian, zero-growth, genocidal lunatics.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:07.623]  I want to cite an advisor to Obama's mentor, Gordon Brown, the British Prime Minister.
[01:27:08.043 --> 01:27:13.346]  There's an advisor to the British government who says 60 billion people in the British Isles is too much.
[01:27:13.837 --> 01:27:16.038]  We're going to cut that in half to 30 million.
[01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:22.499]  Yeah, that was the Times of London two days ago and we're seeing headlines in the US and foreign press.
[01:27:23.079 --> 01:27:27.961]  Babies are carbon monsters and there needs to be a tax on having children.
[01:27:28.021 --> 01:27:32.542]  That's what the UN and others and the Malthusian Eugenicists funded China to do in 1975.
[01:27:32.602 --> 01:27:34.562]  First a tax, then in 1981 it became law.
[01:27:36.903 --> 01:28:00.551]  They are now pushing, as we cover in Endgame, the one-child policy, and on top of that, White House to hunt for new tax revenues, Wall Street Journal, and they admit they're going to get rid of, for even low income, not $250,000 with two people in the House, $125,000 and up, but everybody, they're going to take away basically all, or reduce all, of the tax write-offs.
[01:28:01.011 --> 01:28:03.191]  So, I mean, he promised no new taxes.
[01:28:03.251 --> 01:28:04.612]  Boy, is he a liar.
[01:28:05.441 --> 01:28:09.685]  Yeah, the cap-and-trade carbon tax, it's the same thing.
[01:28:09.865 --> 01:28:12.988]  He says it's going to be two-thirds of a trillion.
[01:28:13.008 --> 01:28:15.590]  It's probably going to be more like a trillion when you get done with it.
[01:28:16.170 --> 01:28:17.051]  A tax on production.
[01:28:17.071 --> 01:28:29.822]  So we have a situation where $10 trillion, supported by Obama, supported by Geithner, Bernanke, and Geithner is the key link between the Bush regime and Paulson and the current one.
[01:28:31.011 --> 01:28:35.934]  8 trillion, 8 to 9 trillion from the Fed, 1 to 2 trillion, I'm counting, from the Treasury.
[01:28:36.334 --> 01:28:41.077]  So 10 trillion as a subsidy for the derivatives bubble and the zombie bankers.
[01:28:41.618 --> 01:28:50.503]  And by my count, the actual useful spending, which is mostly in the emergency relief area, there's some infrastructure, but not very much.
[01:28:50.623 --> 01:28:52.444]  It's about $300 billion.
[01:28:52.464 --> 01:28:53.785]  So it's about 30 to 1.
[01:28:54.606 --> 01:28:59.649]  $30 for the bankers for every $1 of crumbs that falls to us here below the table.
[01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:03.471]  I want to congratulate you on what you said about the Limbaugh critique.
[01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:05.772]  Obama loves the Limbaugh critique.
[01:29:05.812 --> 01:29:07.012]  He can't get enough of it.
[01:29:07.272 --> 01:29:08.213]  He wants more.
[01:29:08.513 --> 01:29:10.453]  He wants Limbaugh to attack him more.
[01:29:11.374 --> 01:29:13.474]  Limbaugh this afternoon had a woman on his show.
[01:29:13.895 --> 01:29:23.738]  She said, I can't live on less than $750,000 here in New York because I've got four kids in private school and how dare you take away my money from the derivatives merchant.
[01:29:24.471 --> 01:29:35.539]  But this Obama loves, because the poor, poor person who's living on twenty or thirty thousand minimum wage jobs... Here's that, and it creates class in between the middle class and the working class, never realizing the elite.
[01:29:36.239 --> 01:29:41.122]  And Obama memos have come out that they are running against, against Rush Limbaugh.
[01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:42.623]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:42.683 --> 01:29:43.364]  Stay there Webster.
[01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:48.347]  Let's talk about how we further derail and shoot down this Malthusian agenda.
[01:29:50.769 --> 01:29:51.709]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.170 --> 01:29:53.671]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.697 --> 01:29:57.478]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.899 --> 01:30:10.983]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:30:11.463 --> 01:30:12.524]  Garden in a can.
[01:30:12.884 --> 01:30:16.445]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[01:30:17.025 --> 01:30:18.786]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:21.327]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[01:30:21.807 --> 01:30:30.856]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[01:30:31.476 --> 01:30:32.477]  Garden in a can.
[01:30:32.898 --> 01:30:33.758]  It's that simple.
[01:30:34.099 --> 01:30:34.419]  Fresh.
[01:30:34.819 --> 01:30:35.200]  Healthy.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:35.960]  Easy.
[01:30:36.501 --> 01:30:40.445]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[01:30:40.845 --> 01:30:41.726]  Ready when you are.
[01:30:42.398 --> 01:30:46.041]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.

[01:30:52.607 --> 01:30:54.629]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:31:03.513 --> 01:31:05.637]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:06.118 --> 01:31:13.110]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:13.698 --> 01:31:19.880]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:20.281 --> 01:31:22.121]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:22.261 --> 01:31:24.682]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:24.762 --> 01:31:35.707]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:36.327 --> 01:31:37.627]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:38.007 --> 01:31:39.368]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:39.873 --> 01:31:46.198]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:55.044 --> 01:31:56.185]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:56.625 --> 01:31:57.806]  The people strike back.
[01:32:00.011 --> 01:32:00.892]  Detoxify.
[01:32:00.952 --> 01:32:05.439]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[01:32:05.579 --> 01:32:11.347]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[01:32:11.548 --> 01:32:15.293]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective Keelermax.
[01:32:15.453 --> 01:32:20.434]  With the help of Nutri-A-Dine, Keeler Max will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins and chemicals.
[01:32:20.554 --> 01:32:26.115]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins and fluoride, bromine and chloride.
[01:32:26.275 --> 01:32:30.216]  Add Malignabla to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[01:32:30.296 --> 01:32:34.857]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[01:32:35.077 --> 01:32:41.578]  And Nutra-Trala to recycle all fat and water-soluble antioxidant cellular protection enzymes and molecules.
[01:32:41.739 --> 01:32:43.959]  Keeler Max and Dr. Bill's Oral Detox.
[01:32:44.159 --> 01:32:44.379]  We're good.
[01:33:12.705 --> 01:33:15.067]  Webster Tarpley is our guest.
[01:33:15.107 --> 01:33:18.350]  We're going to go right back to him in just a moment.
[01:33:22.455 --> 01:33:27.216]  Before I do that, I wanted to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[01:33:27.296 --> 01:33:38.878]  Obviously, when you buy the books and videos and materials off my site, not just the films and books I've made or written, but all the other books and videos we carry, you support the other activists out there and researchers and true journalists like Webster Tarbley.
[01:33:38.918 --> 01:33:42.619]  Please, get the Obama deception, and I'm going to get Webster in his own words.
[01:33:42.639 --> 01:33:48.520]  I don't know what he's going to say, but he's got great ideas on how to get it out to people, to have viewing parties, show it at the library or school.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.721]  This film is deprogramming Obama zombies, so the Obama Deception and Infowars.com.
[01:33:54.901 --> 01:33:56.682]  Also, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:56.702 --> 01:34:03.043]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:34:03.443 --> 01:34:09.165]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds had the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:10.825]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds.
[01:34:11.405 --> 01:34:15.547]  Waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[01:34:15.907 --> 01:34:17.188]  Governments are storing seeds.
[01:34:17.628 --> 01:34:18.749]  The UN is storing seeds.
[01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:21.590]  Globalists of every stripe are storing seeds in the Arctic Circle.
[01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:22.991]  Why do you think they're doing this?
[01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:23.971]  You know why.
[01:34:24.051 --> 01:34:24.471]  Control.
[01:34:24.531 --> 01:34:31.235]  Solutions from Science is trying to get seeds out of the globalist hands and into the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time, one family at a time.
[01:34:31.255 --> 01:34:37.378]  Survival Seed Bank from Solutions from Science contains enough open-pollinated seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:34:38.038 --> 01:34:42.779]  Seeds in the Survival Seed Bank are hand-picked for exceptional germination rates.
[01:34:43.319 --> 01:34:46.240]  Order a couple of seed banks today while you still can, folks.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:47.360]  Survivalseedbank.com or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:50.141]  And one more sponsor of the day I want to thank.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.384]  Are the folks at pmemory.net.
[01:35:02.844 --> 01:35:07.952]  You spend all this time listening to the show every day, but how much of the information can you actually recall?
[01:35:09.013 --> 01:35:12.378]  Test yourself right now and try to recall the show aired one week ago.
[01:35:12.398 --> 01:35:15.222]  How about two weeks ago?
[01:35:16.621 --> 01:35:19.124]  And if you cannot recall it, then that's the point.

[01:35:55.104 --> 01:35:56.264]  And these are all great sponsors.
[01:35:56.364 --> 01:35:58.645]  I endorse them all heartily.
[01:35:58.805 --> 01:36:03.588]  We only promote things that you hear me endorsing that I've used and believe in.
[01:36:03.608 --> 01:36:05.669]  All right, going back to Webster Tarpley.
[01:36:07.165 --> 01:36:17.196]  Webster, earlier I made the point, and I was able to make the call on 9-11, you've made a lot of other calls, just integrating the propaganda, the balance of power, how their agenda is working.
[01:36:17.216 --> 01:36:24.424]  He tried to get 13 million people out on the streets, he only got about 4 million, that was called a failure, that's still very dangerous because they're trying to double that number.
[01:36:25.425 --> 01:36:30.288]  Now they're moving, as you know, they just passed, it's going into conference now, but the House and Senate have both passed it.
[01:36:30.808 --> 01:36:32.950]  Total draft of everybody, basically.
[01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:34.290]  Military for 18 to 25.
[01:36:35.591 --> 01:36:37.913]  Unspeakable level.
[01:36:38.013 --> 01:36:40.874]  The liberal press, New York Times, no one's reporting it.
[01:36:40.894 --> 01:36:44.396]  They just say, oh, a new volunteer thing, isn't it great?
[01:36:45.377 --> 01:36:46.498]  But it says mandatory.
[01:36:47.898 --> 01:36:48.659]  That's happening.
[01:36:49.139 --> 01:36:51.921]  So he is slowing the juggernaut.
[01:36:53.334 --> 01:37:15.175]  is slowing uh... the diversion of a hundred sixty five million a i g is a diversion but it still showed that he'd written executive order for the loopholes for all the companies tens of billions and and bonuses and that uh... the guy whose wife works by the big company for a i g senator dodd was saying he was against the the uh...
[01:37:15.936 --> 01:37:21.157]  Bailout money being used for bonuses when he actually wrote the clause to mirror Obama.
[01:37:21.397 --> 01:37:24.438]  Then they started turning against each other saying, well you told me to, well you told me to.
[01:37:25.158 --> 01:37:25.859]  So speak to that.
[01:37:25.899 --> 01:37:37.322]  So speak to false flag terror and the big scandals and the public's mad at 165 mil on about 10 trill and how we further get the word out and derail this guy.
[01:37:38.362 --> 01:37:40.202]  Yeah, maybe we can start with this ARG.
[01:37:41.243 --> 01:37:42.863]  Obama has a glass jaw.
[01:37:43.992 --> 01:37:46.273]  If you're attacking him from the left, and that's the key.
[01:37:47.053 --> 01:37:56.116]  When Obama had a healthcare summit, he wanted to ban the people who were going to advocate a single-payer, basically Medicare for all, or Medicare for anybody who wants it.
[01:37:56.857 --> 01:37:58.377]  And they threatened to picket him.
[01:37:58.637 --> 01:38:00.938]  And he said, oh no, I can't do that, I've got to let you in.
[01:38:00.978 --> 01:38:03.039]  He didn't let them speak, but he let them in.
[01:38:03.059 --> 01:38:09.781]  Then on AIG, we had Bernanke in the Congress, at the Senate hearing, saying, I won't tell you who got the AIG money.
[01:38:10.421 --> 01:38:12.602]  This means the big money, the tens of billions.
[01:38:13.211 --> 01:38:26.016]  And then you had Cohn, K-O-H-N, this guy who's Bernanke's deputy, a couple of days later at the Dodd-Shelby Committee, and he wouldn't tell who got the money, and that then exploded, and Obama had to cave on that one.
[01:38:26.036 --> 01:38:42.462]  So now we find that the big money of AIG, not the $160 million, or $200 million of bonuses, bad as that is, but the $160 billion of derivatives bailout, remember this is the AIG London branch, their hedge fund, their
[01:38:42.898 --> 01:38:55.702]  Financial Products Division, working with derivatives, derivatives, credit default swaps, and other derivatives, collateralized debt obligations, 3 trillion of those, more than the gross national product of France and any number of other countries.
[01:38:56.242 --> 01:39:09.246]  And out of that money, we find that 10 or 12 billion went to Goldman Sachs, always high on the list of beneficiaries, 10 billion to Barclays Bank in Britain, 10 billion to Deutsche Bank in Berlin and Frankfurt,
[01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:12.711]  And 10 billion to Societe Generale of France.
[01:39:12.751 --> 01:39:18.094]  So, foreign bankers that we know of get 30 to 35 billion of U.S.
[01:39:18.154 --> 01:39:21.196]  taxpayer funds in order to bail out their derivative holdings.
[01:39:21.236 --> 01:39:33.681]  Now, you'd have to say, if Gordon Brown and Sarkozy and Madame Merkel are so concerned about these banks in their countries, why don't they bail them out and let the U.S.
[01:39:34.582 --> 01:39:35.262]  alone on this?
[01:39:35.342 --> 01:39:36.803]  But you see, these are globalized
[01:39:37.361 --> 01:39:39.282]  Investment bankers, and that's how they operate.
[01:39:39.302 --> 01:39:46.848]  So AIG, the business with the bonuses, is really a diversion, but it's also the fact that the culture, I think, is changing.
[01:39:46.888 --> 01:39:49.970]  And this has been, I think, in many ways, a watershed for Obama.
[01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:55.253]  The people are beginning to sense, some of the smarter people are sensing that Obama's a tool of Wall Street.
[01:39:55.273 --> 01:39:56.194]  I'll give you some examples.
[01:39:56.614 --> 01:39:57.735]  Paul Krugman, okay?
[01:39:57.775 --> 01:39:59.036]  Princeton, Nobel Prize.
[01:39:59.636 --> 01:40:05.620]  He says, the zombie ideas have won, and Obama is going with a cash-for-trash program.
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:06.561]  This is the Geithner
[01:40:07.034 --> 01:40:07.494]  Bailout.
[01:40:08.235 --> 01:40:12.558]  The second trillion announced earlier this week by Geithner.
[01:40:12.858 --> 01:40:20.583]  So zombie ideas, cash for trash, and it's all the same stuff from Paulson, recycled now for the third time, says Krugman.
[01:40:21.104 --> 01:40:32.892]  Galbraith, at the University of Texas, he says this is a massively corrupted banking system, and he basically says seize the zombie banks and put them out of existence, and he says
[01:40:33.426 --> 01:40:35.754]  Increase Social Security pensions by one third.
[01:40:35.814 --> 01:40:37.059]  Now that's a step in the right direction.
[01:40:37.432 --> 01:40:43.114]  I would say double Social Security pensions, because you're not going to have a 401k, and you're not going to have anything else.
[01:40:43.134 --> 01:40:44.414]  So that's already something.
[01:40:44.594 --> 01:40:56.257]  And by the way, the 10 trillion bucks, and Bloomberg's reported this, would pay off 90% of the mortgages, massively increase Social Security because of inflation.
[01:40:56.617 --> 01:41:01.059]  So we always hear on the fake right-wing radio, oh it's all about welfare, that's where all the money goes.
[01:41:01.299 --> 01:41:02.499]  That's a tiny percent.
[01:41:02.619 --> 01:41:05.600]  Everything is going to the offshore New World Order banks.
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:17.083]  Who literally, as you said, are sucking the entire world dry and trying to put carbon taxes on industry to further enslave them, pay directly to the bankers.
[01:41:17.163 --> 01:41:19.143]  I mean, this is such an outrageous plan.
[01:41:19.623 --> 01:41:24.324]  How will they get away with it as it's already stalling without staging terror attacks?
[01:41:24.384 --> 01:41:27.365]  Webster, I feel one.
[01:41:27.865 --> 01:41:28.505]  Talk about that.
[01:41:28.545 --> 01:41:29.786]  I think they're about to hit us hard.
[01:41:30.326 --> 01:41:32.426]  Well, we're going to have a 20 to 30 foot fireball here at the Key Bridge.
[01:41:36.615 --> 01:41:38.976]  Across the Potomac River in Washington, D.C.
[01:41:39.036 --> 01:41:39.977]  this afternoon now.
[01:41:40.557 --> 01:41:54.045]  I don't know whether this has gone off yet or not, but they say it's for a film, but people driving along, you know, the George Washington Parkway on one side of the Whitehurst Freeway on the other here in D.C., they're going to see a 30-foot fireball in the middle of the Potomac.
[01:41:54.746 --> 01:42:02.070]  It's supposed to be some ships, some small boats, and one of them blows up as part of a movie, I think, for CBS.
[01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:03.711]  Yes, that's very, very much in the air.
[01:42:04.113 --> 01:42:09.616]  Anyway, these left liberals, Krugman, Galbraith, Grider, Grider of Rolling Stone, typical left liberal.
[01:42:09.836 --> 01:42:11.237]  He wrote a book attacking us.
[01:42:11.277 --> 01:42:13.758]  He wrote a book last year attacking us saying there's no new world order.
[01:42:14.058 --> 01:42:15.899]  Now he writes a thing called The Big Takeover.
[01:42:15.919 --> 01:42:17.760]  He says it's a power takeover by the banks.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.201]  What is that flip-flop?
[01:42:20.222 --> 01:42:29.407]  Well, what they're trying to do, of course, many of these people, Grider I think is a good example, he's trying to have a fake opposition that will be controlled so there won't be a real opposition.
[01:42:29.427 --> 01:42:30.147]  You can also look at
[01:42:30.869 --> 01:42:33.271]  Madame Stassonopoulos Huffington, right?
[01:42:33.311 --> 01:42:39.315]  The rich, elitist oligarch out there in California with her Huffington Post website.
[01:42:39.355 --> 01:42:45.199]  She's attempting to become the fake, controlled opposition to the Obama regime.
[01:42:45.279 --> 01:42:51.624]  And I guess there are various Air America personalities in the same ballpark.
[01:42:51.684 --> 01:42:55.827]  Frank Rich of the New York Times says that AIG is Obama's Katrina.
[01:42:56.206 --> 01:42:57.206]  So you see the idea.
[01:42:57.506 --> 01:42:59.327]  Yes, I think there is a grave danger.
[01:42:59.387 --> 01:43:04.229]  We know that with Obama in office, the door to false flag is now wide open.
[01:43:04.869 --> 01:43:08.770]  And you've got, for example, they're meddling in Sudan.
[01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:16.012]  They have indicted General Bashir of Sudan for crimes against humanity, basically genocide.
[01:43:16.853 --> 01:43:22.174]  And you've got this venomous vampire, Susan Rice, at the United Nations.
[01:43:22.334 --> 01:43:24.635]  This is an apostle of extermination.
[01:43:25.051 --> 01:43:35.575]  This is a woman who was implicated in the great genocide in the Rwanda, Burundi, and Congo, Uganda area in the mid-90s, and now she's back.
[01:43:35.795 --> 01:43:37.516]  She's very influential with Obama.
[01:43:37.884 --> 01:43:42.466]  And she's leading the charge in the United Nations to overthrow the regime in Sudan.
[01:43:42.667 --> 01:43:44.167]  And you predicted that a year ago.
[01:43:44.247 --> 01:43:46.789]  You predicted that they need that black face to go into Africa.
[01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:52.852]  Going back to false flag terror and continuing with your analysis, do we get the word out about false flag terror?
[01:43:52.952 --> 01:43:55.233]  I mean, what are your ideas to counter this?
[01:43:55.273 --> 01:43:58.175]  Because clearly they need this to continue the agenda.
[01:43:58.195 --> 01:44:00.496]  And every time their agenda stalls, they stage terror attacks.
[01:44:01.448 --> 01:44:03.169]  Yeah, look at the question of Sudan.
[01:44:03.269 --> 01:44:12.611]  What I think is likely is that the next round, whenever that is, will come equipped with different targets, naturally.
[01:44:12.651 --> 01:44:14.952]  I think Sudan is a pretty big target right now.
[01:44:15.172 --> 01:44:21.314]  We see the Pentagon already saying that African terrorists are going to hit our bases in Africa or the Middle East or the U.S.
[01:44:21.554 --> 01:44:22.354]  So I agree with you.
[01:44:22.394 --> 01:44:24.535]  I see them saying, now we've got to invade Africa.
[01:44:24.575 --> 01:44:25.595]  The terrorists hit us.
[01:44:26.738 --> 01:44:33.843]  And of course, the secret is that China gets 6, 7, 8 percent of their oil supply from Sudan, and that's the reason.
[01:44:33.903 --> 01:44:36.745]  It's got nothing to do with humanitarian stuff.
[01:44:37.006 --> 01:44:47.693]  You also have to remember the reason that the genocide, there is undoubtedly genocide in the Sahel region of Africa, all across the southern edge of the Sahara, but that's because there's a world economic depression.
[01:44:48.014 --> 01:44:52.117]  What do you think happened to those guys when the price of gasoline went to 150, or of oil went to $150 a gallon?
[01:44:52.137 --> 01:44:52.957]  I mean, they've got to have
[01:44:55.666 --> 01:44:56.726]  Gasoline there too, right?
[01:44:56.786 --> 01:45:00.908]  If they're tractors, trucks run on the same thing as tractors or trucks anywhere else.
[01:45:00.948 --> 01:45:21.535]  So, the depression, and I think that's also got something to do with Mexico, the internal collapse of Mexico is also a feature of a world economic breakdown crisis and global economic collapse, which is going on and on, and it's not influenced by... Well, we've seen Iceland fall, we've seen Argentina fall, we've seen three nations fall, or partially fall, in Eastern Europe.
[01:45:21.875 --> 01:45:23.176]  Are you seeing that accelerate?
[01:45:24.670 --> 01:45:26.792]  Well, I think so, and the problem is we don't know.
[01:45:26.872 --> 01:45:39.223]  I mean, the average, pretend, the last 10 years is that 40,000 people die in the third world every day of malnutrition, starvation, and diseases like diarrhea that can be cured for about 50 cents.
[01:45:39.303 --> 01:45:41.845]  And the carbon tax, they admit, will double that.
[01:45:42.866 --> 01:45:44.667]  Yeah.
[01:45:45.308 --> 01:45:52.414]  I saw an item on the internet lately where somebody said, if you try to bring Africa up to a US or European standard of living,
[01:45:52.884 --> 01:45:53.885]  Well, what would that mean?
[01:45:53.925 --> 01:45:57.107]  And some journalist says, well, you can't do that, that would be bad for the planet.
[01:45:57.147 --> 01:46:13.937]  In other words, you simply can't have development in Africa and South Asia if you're going to have this lunatic obsession with global warming, which of course is a pseudo-scientific fraud developed by Al Gore, not even by Al Gore, but by these circles around Prince Charles.
[01:46:13.977 --> 01:46:14.858]  Club of Rome.
[01:46:15.458 --> 01:46:16.179]  We're back on them.
[01:46:16.219 --> 01:46:16.859]  Yes, exactly.
[01:46:16.899 --> 01:46:17.480]  Club of Rome.
[01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:19.110]  And all that.
[01:46:19.170 --> 01:46:23.493]  This guy Holdren, I want to point to somebody that he deserves more attention than he's getting.
[01:46:23.973 --> 01:46:27.296]  He's the White House Science Advisor to Obama.
[01:46:28.236 --> 01:46:31.698]  And he talks about something called de-development.
[01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:37.322]  In other words, countries that have reached the level of industrial society have to go backwards.
[01:46:37.902 --> 01:46:47.488]  And if you're talking about taking an industrial society and pitching it back into a post-industrial or non-industrial one, which is what is largely happening and has happened in the United States,
[01:46:48.174 --> 01:46:57.978]  The implications of this are genocide, because you get a situation in technical terms where the relative potential population density of the country falls below the population.
[01:46:58.038 --> 01:47:02.180]  So it means there's an overhang that can't be sustained of people, of us, the rest of us.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:04.401]  Holdren talks de-development.
[01:47:04.421 --> 01:47:09.823]  There's an interesting article in Forbes where they talk about the Central Valley of California, right?
[01:47:09.883 --> 01:47:12.864]  It's one of the greatest agricultural production areas
[01:47:13.405 --> 01:47:13.905]  In the world.
[01:47:13.965 --> 01:47:25.850]  If you've ever been down there, the Imperial Valley, El Centro, California, Palm Springs, California... And they say one degree in temperature increase will wipe all that out, when all the studies actually show it'll increase yield.
[01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:35.013]  Yeah, this is making the desert bloom, making the desert into just a tremendously valuable area of agricultural production.
[01:47:35.473 --> 01:47:42.076]  The commitment of the environmental fanatics and Malthusian elitists and basically genocidalists in the Obama regime
[01:47:42.603 --> 01:47:46.686]  Is to shut down agriculture in the Central Valley of California.
[01:47:46.706 --> 01:47:50.489]  Because when the banks bankrupt everything, they get to consolidate power.
[01:47:51.189 --> 01:48:01.836]  Right, but in addition to the banking, which is the main thing of course, that's what holds this whole thing together, there's also the element of a fanatical anti-human ideology.
[01:48:01.977 --> 01:48:06.940]  That is to say, as you quoted before, a baby is a carbon machine.
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.183]  That is, a human being is nothing but a source of carbon pollution.
[01:48:11.704 --> 01:48:34.815]  I mean, that gets you into the area of high crimes against humanity, the Nuremberg Code, and all the issues of... Well, did you see the other environmental minister in England say, your water footprint's too big, and so we're going to restrict everybody's water, when everybody knows England is one of the most water-rich countries in the world, and have never even charged people for their water usage, because it's such a wet aisle.
[01:48:35.615 --> 01:48:35.935]  It's just...
[01:48:37.617 --> 01:48:38.578]  Here's a microcosm.
[01:48:39.859 --> 01:48:43.083]  Nine years ago, eight years ago, Enron documents came out later.
[01:48:43.363 --> 01:48:46.407]  They in some days would make a billion dollars in overcharging.
[01:48:46.427 --> 01:48:48.469]  They had fake energy trading boards.
[01:48:48.489 --> 01:48:57.519]  They would show the congressmen that would come through on tours, and they said in their memos, we've got to double and triple prices just to have profits.
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:07.887]  So, we will turn the power off an hour a day to create the illusion of artificial scarcity, so they'll accept the jacking up of prices, and now they're doing that with water in California.
[01:49:07.907 --> 01:49:14.972]  The environmental groups have shut off all the reservoirs for, you know, some fish or darter, some made-up snail, some kangaroo rat.
[01:49:15.392 --> 01:49:18.154]  And listen, I've been to Smart Growth Conferences, Webster.
[01:49:18.374 --> 01:49:20.256]  They brag there it's a scam.
[01:49:20.636 --> 01:49:22.297]  I would even call them fanatics.
[01:49:22.317 --> 01:49:23.158]  These are just criminals.
[01:49:23.846 --> 01:49:24.386]  Absolutely.
[01:49:25.267 --> 01:49:31.892]  But it's an anti-human ideology, and I think people have got to get down to very basic things.
[01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:36.255]  Are you in favor of human civilization and human society, yes or no?
[01:49:36.555 --> 01:49:40.357]  If the answer is yes, then other things become less important.
[01:49:40.397 --> 01:49:51.325]  But if you really think that human society has to be run for the alleged benefit of polar bears, snail darters, horned owls, and indeed wolves, or God knows what, sharks even,
[01:49:51.887 --> 01:50:02.462]  Uh, then you've really put yourself beyond the pale, and again, you're in the area of the Nuremberg Code, because to deny any population group essential food, shelter, clothing, medical care...
[01:50:03.021 --> 01:50:04.623]  This is a high crime against humanity.
[01:50:04.663 --> 01:50:06.504]  This was the issue at Nuremberg in 1945.
[01:50:06.564 --> 01:50:16.033]  And now the UN has said they will vote for caribou and roaches, and so it's really about people outvoting the general public, saying they represent animals.
[01:50:16.373 --> 01:50:22.259]  Meanwhile, there's all sorts of real environmental degradation that they use the phony environmental movement as a smokescreen for.
[01:50:22.279 --> 01:50:24.100]  Yeah, naturally.
[01:50:24.581 --> 01:50:28.805]  Questions of pollution, of course, are real, and they're questions of real
[01:50:29.386 --> 01:50:33.157]  Toxic pollution in many parts of the world, including in the U.S.
[01:50:34.181 --> 01:50:39.165]  The question of clean water and clean air for human beings is not what these people are about.
[01:50:39.225 --> 01:50:44.068]  They're essentially about the idea of turning the clock back to the Dark Ages.
[01:50:44.169 --> 01:50:48.472]  They say neo-feudalism served them, and Tarbley's done his separate research, found the same findings.
[01:50:48.592 --> 01:50:50.113]  I've done separate research, found the findings.
[01:50:51.034 --> 01:50:53.095]  Dr. Monteith, I mean, this is the truth we're telling you.
[01:50:53.155 --> 01:50:55.137]  Final segment with Webster Tarbley.
[01:50:55.197 --> 01:50:55.797]  Straight ahead.
[01:50:55.897 --> 01:50:56.558]  Stay the course.
[01:50:56.858 --> 01:50:57.659]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:57.739 --> 01:50:58.739]  Infowars.com.
[01:51:01.013 --> 01:51:01.894]  Spring is here.
[01:51:02.154 --> 01:51:02.934]  Growing season.
[01:51:03.114 --> 01:51:05.096]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:51:05.296 --> 01:51:06.717]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:51:07.017 --> 01:51:07.678]  Think about it.
[01:51:07.998 --> 01:51:11.840]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:15.563]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:51:15.823 --> 01:51:17.464]  The country is running out of food.
[01:51:17.724 --> 01:51:20.306]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:51:20.566 --> 01:51:30.753]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you
[01:51:30.913 --> 01:51:31.233]  I think so.
[01:52:00.982 --> 01:52:06.218]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.023 --> 01:52:12.347]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:12.887 --> 01:52:19.091]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.391 --> 01:52:21.212]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.352 --> 01:52:23.754]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:23.814 --> 01:52:34.721]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.012 --> 01:52:38.253]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:38.673 --> 01:52:40.075]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:40.535 --> 01:52:46.860]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:55.226]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:55.707 --> 01:52:56.848]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.288 --> 01:52:58.469]  The people strike back.
[01:53:00.413 --> 01:53:03.775]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:53:03.936 --> 01:53:09.139]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:53:09.339 --> 01:53:14.103]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:53:14.483 --> 01:53:25.611]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:53:25.991 --> 01:53:31.534]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:53:31.775 --> 01:53:37.858]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:53:38.038 --> 01:53:38.699]  What about you?
[01:53:39.079 --> 01:53:45.123]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:54:21.013 --> 01:54:28.180]  Those of us that love freedom, human decency, creativity, honor, we have to stand against the evil, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:54:28.901 --> 01:54:33.445]  Because all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:54:33.465 --> 01:54:37.189]  That's why I'm turning the heat up.
[01:54:37.209 --> 01:54:40.872]  I'm gonna make a whole nother Obama film in the next two and a half months.
[01:54:40.912 --> 01:54:43.215]  It's gonna come out July 4th, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:44.770 --> 01:54:47.312]  I'll tell you the name of the film next week and the details.
[01:54:47.352 --> 01:54:50.754]  I've already written the film, collated the latest data into it.
[01:54:51.634 --> 01:54:52.775]  Get the Obama Deception today.
[01:54:53.795 --> 01:55:00.980]  The Obama Deception Webster, I want to close the show out here because on the phone you've just been ranting and raving about it and I'm really pleased.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.561]  You don't usually just hand out compliments like this and I respect your view.
[01:55:04.282 --> 01:55:05.802]  You also consulted and are in the film.
[01:55:07.564 --> 01:55:10.185]  And I've heard your own radio show a few Saturdays ago you were going over it.
[01:55:10.245 --> 01:55:11.066]  In the last few minutes
[01:55:11.926 --> 01:55:13.487]  How important is the Obama Deception?
[01:55:13.527 --> 01:55:22.029]  How effective, because it doesn't come from a left-wing or right-wing, it shows the big picture, as you called it, reality, reality-based information, which is so rare today.
[01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:23.650]  How effective is the film?
[01:55:23.690 --> 01:55:24.570]  How should it be used?
[01:55:24.970 --> 01:55:31.212]  What should people be doing, mobilizing with the Obama Deception, and then passing along your books as well as documentation?
[01:55:32.393 --> 01:55:33.933]  Well, again, it's a masterpiece.
[01:55:34.113 --> 01:55:38.855]  It's the best political documentary to come out of the United States in, well, decades, I guess.
[01:55:39.821 --> 01:55:42.163]  And right now, it's also timely.
[01:55:42.183 --> 01:55:46.345]  In other words, this is the moment to lose these illusions.
[01:55:46.486 --> 01:55:48.267]  Because you've got these opinion leaders, right?
[01:55:48.287 --> 01:55:51.649]  The various Krugman's, Galbraith's... And it ties him to the bankers.
[01:55:51.729 --> 01:55:54.231]  It shows he's establishment, not anti-establishment.
[01:55:54.791 --> 01:55:55.171]  He is.
[01:55:55.352 --> 01:55:56.392]  He's not the New Deal.
[01:55:56.432 --> 01:55:57.533]  He's the anti-New Deal.
[01:55:57.573 --> 01:55:58.394]  He's not Roosevelt.
[01:55:58.414 --> 01:55:59.534]  He's the anti-Roosevelt.
[01:55:59.574 --> 01:56:01.716]  He is a puppet of these characters.
[01:56:01.796 --> 01:56:03.217]  Blank Fein of Goldman Sachs.
[01:56:03.457 --> 01:56:04.678]  Mack of Morgan Stanley.
[01:56:05.157 --> 01:56:11.539]  Diamond of JPMorgan Chase, Lewis of Bank of America, and the rest of these people.
[01:56:11.559 --> 01:56:14.780]  And he needs to be attacked by the right wing, that empowers him.
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.481]  Right, that gives him left cover.
[01:56:17.161 --> 01:56:21.822]  What has changed now is that the crimes of Bush were conducted under right wing cover.
[01:56:21.842 --> 01:56:26.023]  9-11, war on terror, bring it on, all the rest of this nonsense.
[01:56:26.664 --> 01:56:29.304]  Now with Obama, it's not any of that.
[01:56:29.324 --> 01:56:34.006]  I'm Obama the savior, I'm the messiah, I have left cover.
[01:56:34.684 --> 01:56:35.105]  I don't know.
[01:56:45.325 --> 01:56:51.687]  Union Buster, Arne Duncan, the Secretary of Education, that guy's going to try to destroy every teacher's union in the U.S.
[01:56:51.727 --> 01:56:52.508]  because they're determined.
[01:56:52.528 --> 01:56:54.428]  Well, this is what corporate looters do.
[01:56:54.569 --> 01:56:58.710]  All their new taxes are going to destroy the real economy, the middle class.
[01:56:59.130 --> 01:57:00.311]  The bankers know that.
[01:57:00.991 --> 01:57:02.331]  They want a fire sale.
[01:57:02.371 --> 01:57:09.494]  They want, just like they go into corporations and use naked shorts to drive them down to buy them up, these guys are piratical wreckers.
[01:57:10.294 --> 01:57:10.455]  Right.
[01:57:12.008 --> 01:57:15.590]  Of course, the idea is that they're well-advanced into destroying the UAW.
[01:57:15.610 --> 01:57:21.474]  So we're going to go from the traditional American economy is a high-wage economy, and that's exactly what you want.
[01:57:21.975 --> 01:57:26.918]  Skilled labor, high-quality, high-value-added, energy-intensive... Complex economy.
[01:57:27.278 --> 01:57:30.921]  Well, in closing, specifically, what should folks do with the Obama deception?
[01:57:31.461 --> 01:57:36.064]  Well, obviously buy it, distribute it, according to the conditions of sale, right?
[01:57:36.965 --> 01:57:37.605]  And get it out.
[01:57:38.163 --> 01:57:43.566]  And try to build this into a backlash, because we're getting... Obama's getting bogged down.
[01:57:43.626 --> 01:57:47.388]  I wanted to mention the group of 20 next week, right?
[01:57:47.428 --> 01:57:48.488]  There's the summit of the group of 20.
[01:57:48.688 --> 01:57:55.371]  It's time to ban derivatives, to shut down the zombie banks, and to deprive Obama of his left coverage.
[01:57:55.551 --> 01:58:06.697]  The thing that occurred to me, Alex, is we have the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, the Berlin Film Festival, with the Golden Palm, the Golden Lion, the Golden Bear, and I'm sure other parts of the world, too.
[01:58:07.412 --> 01:58:09.734]  It seems to me that this has a world dimension.
[01:58:09.794 --> 01:58:11.235]  In other words, there's a world marker.
[01:58:11.375 --> 01:58:13.076]  Yes, the film is going out worldwide.
[01:58:13.156 --> 01:58:24.064]  Webster, we're out of time, but Webster's going to be in studio with me this Sunday evening in town for the second Obama film here with shooting and in studio Monday co-hosting with me before he goes back to D.C.
[01:58:24.724 --> 01:58:27.426]  So, Webster, I will see you this weekend, my friend.
[01:58:27.446 --> 01:58:31.469]  Congratulations again on the Obama deception and everybody should buy it.
[01:58:32.130 --> 01:58:32.670]  Thank you, Webster.
[01:58:32.690 --> 01:58:33.951]  Let me say bye to you as the show ends.
[01:58:34.251 --> 01:58:37.453]  Retransmission with a ton of guests starts right now.
[01:58:37.813 --> 01:58:39.514]  The Mass Grave Story is how we open the show.
[01:58:39.574 --> 01:58:40.014]  Stay with us.
[01:58:41.915 --> 01:58:43.276]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:52.103]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.223 --> 01:58:56.865]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:56.965 --> 01:58:59.705]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:58:59.906 --> 01:59:02.766]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:02.946 --> 01:59:08.808]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.048 --> 01:59:11.990]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:19.176]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.276 --> 01:59:22.398]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
