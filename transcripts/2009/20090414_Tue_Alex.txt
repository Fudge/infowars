[00:00:05.143 --> 00:00:09.968]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:11.570]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.490]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.315]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:21.379]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:56.869]  We've got the Bilderberg Group meeting coming up here in the next month and a half, and Jim Tucker believes he's found the location of the 2009 World Summit Crime Syndicate Commission meeting right out of the Godfather.
[00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:07.012]  And of course it's on the Mediterranean in Greece, so we'll have Jim Tucker joining us coming up in an hour and a half, veteran newspaper reporter.
[00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:28.690]  Then we have another guest, an Argentine economist from Argentina, looking at what happened there in the last eight years, the engineered collapse of their society, run by the very same crime syndicate known as the Bilderberg Group, publicly known as Globalism, the New World Order.
[00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.371]  So that is coming up.
[00:01:31.394 --> 00:01:36.236]  There's a video online, a documentary made in Argentina about the collapse.
[00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:38.217]  It's over two hours long.
[00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:40.338]  That has received millions of views.
[00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:41.759]  Very, very informative.
[00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.740]  And he's one of the main people in that video.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.523]  So I thought we would get him on the show.
[00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:53.845]  I'm going to have open phones here in the first hour and a half.
[00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:56.946]  I know a lot of you want to chime in on the Obama deception.
[00:01:56.946 --> 00:01:57.847]  Now out for a month.
[00:01:58.837 --> 00:02:01.900]  Number one viral video out there on the internet.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.703]  I know a lot of you want to chime in on the economy.
[00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:11.149]  Barack Obama giving a speech saying the economy is getting better, putting out a bunch of lies and propaganda.
[00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:21.038]  All these federal reports, the Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment Report coming out for everybody.
[00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:21.939]  And in that report,
[00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:35.380]  They go over a host of issues, demonizing gun owners, people protesting the unfair income tax that keeps getting raised and raised.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:51.134]  We've got the new federal report that the Washington Times and other mainstream publications reported on today, linked up at the top of the Drudge Report, where they say basically gun owners and people buying guns and ammo are terrorists and the number one threat to the government, the number one worry of law enforcement.
[00:02:52.329 --> 00:03:09.135]  There's also the video, a lot of you had a chance to see up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com of Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson last Friday in Kansas City up there interviewing an economist and federal regulator, former federal regulator, Professor Black, for the new Obama film we're working on.
[00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:17.078]  And they are literally, I said 150 yards, they're more like a half mile away from the Federal Reserve at a city park.
[00:03:17.078 --> 00:03:21.120]  And these federal security guards come over and say, leave or we're arresting you.
[00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:24.873]  And start putting their hands on their tasers.
[00:03:24.873 --> 00:03:28.575]  And the guys just wanted to get back with the footage and the interviews they've done.
[00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:30.217]  They pointed out, well, you're violating our First Amendment.
[00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:31.257]  This is made up.
[00:03:31.257 --> 00:03:32.338]  You don't have jurisdiction here.
[00:03:32.338 --> 00:03:36.901]  And they said, look, we're going to arrest you.
[00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:37.742]  We're going to attack you.
[00:03:38.744 --> 00:03:40.044]  Uh, we can do it on arrest.
[00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:40.785]  We have arrest powers.
[00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:43.105]  Well, so do citizens have arrest powers.
[00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:44.425]  Uh, so just unbelievable.
[00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:52.788]  I mean, pretty soon, I guess, the Federal Reserve will come to your backyard barbecue with people in black uniforms and say, uh, you can't be here with a video camera.
[00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:55.148]  You can't be here talking about the Federal Reserve.
[00:03:55.148 --> 00:03:57.929]  I mean, that's what America has turned into.
[00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:00.269]  You can watch the YouTube video.
[00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.971]  I mean, literally, the big skyscraper Federal Reserve building in Kansas City is tiny in the distance.
[00:04:07.677 --> 00:04:17.365]  It's tiny in the distance and people in black uniforms show up and say, give us your names or we'll arrest you.
[00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:22.589]  And Aaron's like, well, you can't really do that, but okay, I mean, here's my name.
[00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:24.470]  They said, okay, now leave.
[00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.791]  And see, that's what tyranny is.
[00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:29.734]  It's just thugs in uniforms running around saying, look, I own you.
[00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:31.556]  You're my slave now.
[00:04:31.556 --> 00:04:34.478]  And the public cowers and yes, we're going to do what you say.
[00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:38.219]  And so we've got that coming up as well.
[00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.203]  A bunch of states are declaring sovereignty.
[00:04:41.203 --> 00:04:42.985]  People poo-pooed it, laughed at it.
[00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:46.308]  Said, Alex, you and your people don't have a prayer with this.
[00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:48.514]  Oh yeah?
[00:04:48.514 --> 00:04:52.296]  Get ready for the latest developments on that front when we get back.
[00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:55.499]  Resistance is futile, Jones!
[00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:57.080]  Stand down!
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.340]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.081]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:02.343]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:07.947]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:07.947 --> 00:05:12.970]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.972]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.534]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:23.758]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:23.758 --> 00:05:26.059]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.863]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:31.984]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:31.984 --> 00:05:34.766]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:38.688]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:41.871]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:43.672]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:05:44.181 --> 00:05:44.861]  Give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:45.162]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:45.162 --> 00:05:48.644]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:48.644 --> 00:05:50.384]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:01.613 --> 00:06:07.658]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:13.543]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.543 --> 00:06:19.709]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:21.991]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:24.473]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.473 --> 00:06:37.663]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.324]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.324 --> 00:06:41.186]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:41.186 --> 00:06:47.431]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:56.343 --> 00:06:57.924]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.924 --> 00:06:59.125]  The people strike back!
[00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:06.235]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:07:06.235 --> 00:07:14.801]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:18.363]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:07:18.363 --> 00:07:21.605]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:24.107]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[00:07:24.107 --> 00:07:27.089]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[00:07:53.157 --> 00:07:54.498]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:54.498 --> 00:07:55.578]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:32.702 --> 00:08:41.590]  Just during the break I was watching CNN with Obama giving a speech and in three minutes it was just all lies, all disinformation.
[00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:46.254]  When everything they're saying is deception and lies, how do you even debunk it?
[00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:48.455]  When it's a tissue of lies.
[00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:53.099]  He was saying we're fighting the bubble economy, we're not going to allow bubble economies.
[00:08:54.099 --> 00:09:02.962]  When they've just pumped 12.8 trillion into the private banks who are using that to snatch up the roads, the ports, our companies, our infrastructure.
[00:09:02.962 --> 00:09:04.862]  He said, we're going to get credit flowing.
[00:09:04.862 --> 00:09:10.644]  The banks have been hoarding the money to further implode the economy so they can buy things up even cheaper.
[00:09:10.644 --> 00:09:14.785]  I mean, they have IMF and World Bank public handbooks on how they do this.
[00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:24.550]  And then he went on to, I guess, tell something that was halfway true, but it was a lie, you know, claiming that it's good for us, that we're going to have a sustainable economy now.
[00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:37.221]  That means a big socialist economy where the general public is totally and completely enslaved and basically work for corporations that have government contracts or work for the government.
[00:09:38.476 --> 00:09:40.477]  And where they just raise the taxes.
[00:09:40.477 --> 00:09:47.362]  In fact, Obama's in the news this morning going, oh, I know there's record amounts of people that can't pay their taxes.
[00:09:47.362 --> 00:09:52.186]  We're going to show compassion.
[00:09:52.186 --> 00:10:05.135]  And there's these disgusting articles everywhere with people calling up, groveling, worshipping the IRS, saying, oh my gosh, here's Reuters, more Americans wary of tax man this year because they just don't have the money.
[00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:09.428]  They get their paychecks and they have their small businesses or companies.
[00:10:09.428 --> 00:10:20.394]  There's no money left at the end after they, you know, pay for their house and their cars and their employees, or even if they're the sole proprietor and only have, you know, themselves as an employee.
[00:10:20.394 --> 00:10:22.535]  And the IRS is saying, don't worry.
[00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:26.977]  With interest, we have a payment plan for you.
[00:10:26.977 --> 00:10:28.658]  What did the stimulus package do?
[00:10:28.658 --> 00:10:34.521]  It gave hundreds of billions of dollars to credit card companies so they could loan the money out to you at 30% interest.
[00:10:36.118 --> 00:10:37.059]  Loan sharking.
[00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:43.864]  Oh, we're taking taxpayers' money and giving it to the loan sharks so they can give you credit cards at 25-30% interest.
[00:10:43.864 --> 00:10:49.808]  I mean, this is how these people operate.
[00:10:49.808 --> 00:10:52.530]  It's just fraud within fraud within fraud.
[00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:53.671]  Let's see what he's saying right now.
[00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:55.733]  Go ahead and fade the liar-in-chief up for us.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:10.468]  Just as after the Great Depression, new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation that helped to create the Depression, so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules.
[00:11:10.468 --> 00:11:15.071]  Create rules that punish shortcuts and abuse.
[00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:19.293]  Rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance.
[00:11:19.293 --> 00:11:21.634]  A novel concept.
[00:11:21.634 --> 00:11:25.877]  Rules that protect typical American families when they buy a home.
[00:11:27.324 --> 00:11:31.267]  Get a credit card or invest in a 401k.
[00:11:31.267 --> 00:11:37.992]  So we've already begun to work with Congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatory framework.
[00:11:37.992 --> 00:11:45.198]  And I expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is up.
[00:11:45.198 --> 00:11:50.802]  The second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our workers for a 21st century economy.
[00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:58.913]  You know, in the 20th century, the GI Bill helped send a generation to college.
[00:11:58.913 --> 00:12:09.038]  For decades, we led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence, we led the world in economic growth.
[00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:17.922]  But in this new economy, we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educational achievement, in the production of scientists and engineers.
[00:12:19.804 --> 00:12:28.066]  That's why we have set a goal that will greatly enhance our ability to compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century.
[00:12:28.066 --> 00:12:35.148]  By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.
[00:12:35.148 --> 00:12:37.329]  That is the goal that we have set and we intend to meet.
[00:12:43.257 --> 00:12:45.279]  The government is just going to do everything for you.
[00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:49.343]  But, of course, college degrees will come in Happy Meals.
[00:12:49.343 --> 00:12:54.148]  Yes, I'm sure that they will have the highest level of people degreed.
[00:12:54.148 --> 00:13:04.919]  And you'll pay, I guess, a half million dollars for a degree that you get out of a Happy Meal that, I guess, teaches you how to spy on your neighbors and that the Second Amendment is bad and that global government is good.
[00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:07.201]  I mean, that's about all you learn in college now these days anyways.
[00:13:09.582 --> 00:13:11.163]  But I'm sitting here watching the President.
[00:13:11.163 --> 00:13:14.466]  I mean, it's just all disinformation, all lies.
[00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:16.829]  They are busy looting this country.
[00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:32.843]  I mean, this is the President that says he's going to cut the deficit in half within two years when he just took Bush's tripling of the government over eight years and is openly doubling that in one year.
[00:13:32.843 --> 00:13:34.965]  He's doubling the tripling.
[00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:40.357]  In fact, they even admit that in the mainstream news.
[00:13:40.357 --> 00:13:45.541]  They say, oh yes, he's doubling the size of government in his first year.
[00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:49.464]  Yes, doubling a government that was tripled in size over eight.
[00:13:49.464 --> 00:13:50.605]  I mean, we thought Bush was bad.
[00:13:50.605 --> 00:13:53.827]  I thought Bush was bad.
[00:13:53.827 --> 00:14:01.673]  My goodness, but now you know why Wall Street gave four times more money to Obama than they did to McCain.
[00:14:01.673 --> 00:14:05.416]  Now you know why the media loves Barack Obama so much.
[00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:13.792]  Because this is the guy that's going to gut the fat hog that's America once and for good for the globalists.
[00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:20.654]  And when this guy's done, when this front man is complete, there won't be anything left in this country.
[00:14:20.654 --> 00:14:23.835]  I mean, we will be one giant third world armpit.
[00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:25.495]  We're basically almost there already.
[00:14:25.495 --> 00:14:31.057]  But the little pockets of free market and wealth and happiness are gone.
[00:14:31.057 --> 00:14:33.318]  Because these guys are going to steal it.
[00:14:34.943 --> 00:14:37.384]  The globalists don't want any independent wealthy nations.
[00:14:37.384 --> 00:14:38.704]  They don't want a middle class.
[00:14:38.704 --> 00:14:45.665]  They want you under their institutionalized control and they've set it on record.
[00:14:45.665 --> 00:14:51.586]  More Americans wary of tax man this year as a deep recession strips Americans of their jobs.
[00:14:51.586 --> 00:14:53.727]  Homeless and Investments 2009 U.S.
[00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:58.868]  tax season promises to see large uptick in first-time delinquent income taxpayers.
[00:14:59.887 --> 00:15:09.154]  Our calls are up 280 percent, said Richard Boggs, founder and chief executive of Los Angeles-based Nationwide Tax Relief, a firm that helps delinquent taxpayers resolve tax issues.
[00:15:09.154 --> 00:15:12.296]  We've seen a huge rise in what we call rookie delinquent taxpayers.
[00:15:12.296 --> 00:15:15.799]  He said, they're incredibly scared.
[00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:17.079]  We'll be like an illegal alien.
[00:15:17.079 --> 00:15:22.143]  You can rape, kill, steal, not have insurance, not pay taxes, you'll be paid welfare by the government.
[00:15:22.143 --> 00:15:23.304]  You know, just be like them.
[00:15:23.304 --> 00:15:25.586]  Oh, but I'm sorry, you're a fat hog American.
[00:15:25.586 --> 00:15:28.548]  You're known to be the coward to be squeezed and controlled.
[00:15:29.977 --> 00:15:38.543]  They are incredibly scared, and they have no idea what's going to happen to them, because God bless them, they've never owed before.
[00:15:38.543 --> 00:15:44.247]  As the weak economy puts job security and steady flow of income on a slippery slope, many are wary of the U.S.
[00:15:44.247 --> 00:15:46.449]  taxman, tax consultants say.
[00:15:46.449 --> 00:15:50.712]  With thousands of household balance sheets under pressure, more U.S.
[00:15:50.712 --> 00:15:51.653]  households are paying
[00:15:54.292 --> 00:16:12.245]  We're having trouble keeping up with their day-to-day bills and struggling to pay their taxes, their taxes, to the private Federal Reserve that was set up in 1913 that runs the banking system that is imploding our country, folding it in on itself so they can cram it down their big fat mouth.
[00:16:12.245 --> 00:16:14.327]  And they're using our money.
[00:16:14.327 --> 00:16:16.488]  They're running out the credit card.
[00:16:16.488 --> 00:16:20.391]  $12.8 trillion in six months, that'll be double the GDP in one year.
[00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:21.252]  It's already the GDP.
[00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:28.931]  And it's all going to offshore banks and corporations to fund their world government.
[00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:30.591]  And then they're going to squeeze you.
[00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:32.692]  Every state's passing new taxes.
[00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:34.972]  New York, 80-something new taxes.
[00:16:34.972 --> 00:16:39.393]  And they're going to take your property, take your home, squeeze you, SWAT team you.
[00:16:39.393 --> 00:16:41.334]  They're going to send the police.
[00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:45.875]  And anybody that fights back with the Second Amendment is going to be called a terrorist.
[00:16:45.875 --> 00:16:46.955]  And that's what America is.
[00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:55.518]  You're going to have more head-hunting, more federal bounties on kidnapping your kids.
[00:16:55.518 --> 00:17:00.619]  I saw a bunch of mainstream newscasts on YouTube last night even admitting that.
[00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:04.079]  They just go out and grab people who've done nothing to their children because they've got a bounty on them.
[00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.480]  The job is to break up the family.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.220]  See, the globalists want to undermine society to consolidate it.
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:10.921]  It's like a mosquito.
[00:17:10.921 --> 00:17:18.982]  It injects an enzyme into you that liquefies your cells into a thin gruel they can slurp up their proboscis.
[00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.272]  Or the proboscis.
[00:17:22.272 --> 00:17:23.373]  And that's what the globalists are.
[00:17:23.373 --> 00:17:24.834]  They're big, fat mosquitoes.
[00:17:24.834 --> 00:17:26.896]  Big, fat ticks.
[00:17:26.896 --> 00:17:30.019]  That inject anticoagulants into us.
[00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:31.120]  They wreck society.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.882]  They gobble.
[00:17:33.882 --> 00:17:36.224]  So more Americans wary of the tax man.
[00:17:36.224 --> 00:17:37.766]  You're not meant to be able to pay.
[00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:38.907]  You're meant to implode.
[00:17:38.907 --> 00:17:40.588]  You're meant to collapse.
[00:17:40.588 --> 00:17:43.771]  So the big social welfare grid can come in and chew your family up.
[00:17:50.421 --> 00:17:58.622]  So that's the type of news that we have here today that we're going to be going over.
[00:17:58.622 --> 00:18:00.663]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.123]  Matt in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:05.644]  I'm on now?
[00:18:05.644 --> 00:18:08.124]  Yes, you are.
[00:18:08.124 --> 00:18:11.805]  First of all, I want to thank you for the free podcast and everything.
[00:18:11.805 --> 00:18:17.466]  Usually during the daytime I can only listen to you.
[00:18:17.466 --> 00:18:18.926]  I'm sorry, I'm kind of nervous.
[00:18:18.926 --> 00:18:19.726]  That's alright, go ahead sir.
[00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:26.219]  Um, what it is, is I usually listen to the local radio as I'm coming back and forth to work.
[00:18:26.219 --> 00:18:33.365]  And I listen to, uh, Neil Bortz, and he was talking about Homeland Security and the document and stuff like that.
[00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:38.849]  And he was saying that, um, I'm sorry, I'm nervous.
[00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:40.831]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:44.854]  Um, well, anyway, he turned everything into a liberal issue.
[00:18:44.854 --> 00:18:47.596]  Why is there no left wing on the document?
[00:18:47.596 --> 00:18:48.597]  Why is it just right wing?
[00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:50.660]  And everything like that.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:19:00.453]  Now that, you know, and everything here locally and Nashville and everything, they're talking about all the big tea parties and stuff like that, and why don't the left have anything like that?
[00:19:00.453 --> 00:19:03.857]  Why aren't they coming up against this stuff about the IRS and stuff like that?
[00:19:04.838 --> 00:19:10.159]  Well, because the so-called left are all Big Banker Foundation owned and run.
[00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:16.041]  All these big websites literally attacking me are Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation funded.
[00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:19.082]  In fact, I'm going to cover that some later in the hour.
[00:19:19.082 --> 00:19:22.882]  And so they're there wanting more taxes.
[00:19:22.882 --> 00:19:24.443]  See, the average liberal on the street
[00:19:25.143 --> 00:19:31.829]  thinks that oh it's lovey-dovey and social welfare net and that it's helping the poor to have big government.
[00:19:31.829 --> 00:19:38.574]  They don't understand big government is for the big corporations through their tax-free foundations to steal the working people's money.
[00:19:38.574 --> 00:19:41.317]  And so the left loves the taxes.
[00:19:41.317 --> 00:19:46.581]  That's why they list the Tea Parties as basically terrorists in a lot of these documents.
[00:19:46.581 --> 00:19:53.067]  It's because the hereditary enemy of the globalists is paleoconservatives
[00:20:05.575 --> 00:20:08.857]  Times are tough right now, and people are unsure about our future.
[00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:13.119]  The economy is hurting, even though there are powers that would make us believe differently.
[00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:16.220]  Banks are failing, and the gold buyers are buying.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:22.724]  Question, with all the chemicals being put into our air, how do you use gold when you are very sick
[00:20:23.516 --> 00:20:24.397]  We're good to go.
[00:20:41.432 --> 00:20:45.576]  Call us!
[00:20:45.576 --> 00:20:46.557]  928-308-0408.
[00:20:46.557 --> 00:20:49.841]  Again, 928-308-0408.
[00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:53.484]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[00:20:53.484 --> 00:20:56.147]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:20:56.147 --> 00:20:57.328]  Life Change Tea.
[00:20:57.328 --> 00:21:01.332]  We're changing lives.
[00:21:01.332 --> 00:21:03.915]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.136]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:07.136 --> 00:21:14.720]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.864]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:21.284 --> 00:21:23.265]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:23.265 --> 00:21:25.767]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.767 --> 00:21:37.355]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:37.355 --> 00:21:39.016]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:39.016 --> 00:21:40.877]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.877 --> 00:21:47.101]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:56.038]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:56.038 --> 00:21:57.620]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.821]  The people strike back!
[00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:01.673]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:01.673 --> 00:22:06.617]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:14.684]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:14.684 --> 00:22:20.269]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:27.255]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:27.535 --> 00:22:33.116]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:33.116 --> 00:22:38.197]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:38.197 --> 00:22:46.138]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:46.138 --> 00:22:52.699]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:52.699 --> 00:22:53.820]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:56.842]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.024 --> 00:23:03.546]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:23:03.546 --> 00:23:05.466]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:23:05.466 --> 00:23:11.009]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:23:11.009 --> 00:23:19.052]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:23:19.052 --> 00:23:29.596]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:30.136]  I think so.
[00:24:13.602 --> 00:24:21.666]  I mean, how can anybody believe anything Barack Obama says?
[00:24:21.666 --> 00:24:25.247]  Everything is a lie.
[00:24:25.247 --> 00:24:28.989]  He's 6.5% African.
[00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:32.131]  6.5%, so it's a lie that he's black.
[00:24:32.131 --> 00:24:35.352]  He didn't get a rescue dog like he said he was, and that's now in the news.
[00:24:35.352 --> 00:24:37.893]  That's a lie.
[00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:40.775]  And not that that matters, it's just everything he says is a lie.
[00:24:42.784 --> 00:24:47.347]  He said he wasn't going to try to go after our guns and that's all they've done is introduce bills to do that.
[00:24:47.347 --> 00:24:48.467]  That's another lie.
[00:24:48.467 --> 00:24:50.229]  He said he wouldn't hire any lobbyists.
[00:24:50.229 --> 00:24:51.089]  That's all he's hired.
[00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:52.190]  That's another lie.
[00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.632]  He said he was going to bring us out of Iraq immediately.
[00:24:54.632 --> 00:24:56.093]  That's another lie.
[00:24:56.093 --> 00:25:00.916]  He said that he was going to end the Patriot Act and end warrantless wiretapping and spying.
[00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:04.498]  He's done nothing but expand it even above and beyond what Bush did.
[00:25:04.498 --> 00:25:05.099]  More lies.
[00:25:06.139 --> 00:25:08.780]  Just a complete and absolute total liar.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.122]  He said he was against the bonuses and was fighting against it.
[00:25:12.122 --> 00:25:19.966]  It turned out he signed the executive order and had Senator Dodd write the bill so they would get the bonuses from the bailout money.
[00:25:19.966 --> 00:25:22.367]  He outdoes Bill Clinton.
[00:25:22.367 --> 00:25:24.328]  But I'll tell you who also outdoes Bill Clinton.
[00:25:24.328 --> 00:25:25.209]  The media.
[00:25:25.209 --> 00:25:27.810]  They don't call him on his lies.
[00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.091]  Except for Keith Oberman is now calling him on his lies.
[00:25:31.091 --> 00:25:31.972]  But apologizes.
[00:25:33.311 --> 00:25:45.858]  And says, well, I, you know, still like Obama, but he is worse than Bush on secret arrest and torture and no rights and spying on the American people and I don't know what's happening and what do you think, Law Professor Jonathan Turley?
[00:25:45.858 --> 00:25:53.262]  Well, yes, I have to say that just because he's a messianic savior, he can't, he has to know that just because he has all this support doesn't mean he can do this.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:59.724]  And I look at him up there with his nose up in the air, with that Mussolini look, and he just makes me sick.
[00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:02.226]  In fact, let's hear what the liar's saying right now.
[00:26:02.226 --> 00:26:04.087]  Let's go ahead and fade him back up.
[00:26:04.087 --> 00:26:10.452]  That insists on instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher poll numbers.
[00:26:10.452 --> 00:26:16.496]  When a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from shock to trance.
[00:26:16.496 --> 00:26:23.682]  With everyone responding to the tempest of the moment until the furor's died down, the media coverage has moved on to something else.
[00:26:25.054 --> 00:26:31.835]  Instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way.
[00:26:31.835 --> 00:26:33.536]  Hit pause.
[00:26:33.536 --> 00:26:35.296]  Or this is live, I can't hit pause.
[00:26:35.296 --> 00:26:37.716]  I'm about to throw up here.
[00:26:37.716 --> 00:26:44.257]  I mean, this is... By the way, for those that don't know, they teach news reporters and people NLP.
[00:26:44.257 --> 00:26:47.378]  The cadence, the chanting, the words.
[00:26:47.378 --> 00:26:50.859]  And he does it, Glenn Beck does it.
[00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:52.479]  I just started looking into this a few years ago.
[00:26:53.806 --> 00:26:55.367]  And it's real.
[00:26:55.367 --> 00:26:56.568]  And that's what he just did right there.
[00:26:56.568 --> 00:26:59.270]  He even uses the word trance.
[00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.112]  And he just does all this programming.
[00:27:02.112 --> 00:27:03.393]  And he keeps saying sustainable.
[00:27:03.393 --> 00:27:06.095]  This is gonna hurt you, the economy's gonna get worse.
[00:27:06.095 --> 00:27:07.717]  But it's gonna be sustainable.
[00:27:07.717 --> 00:27:09.278]  Look, this is the way out of it.
[00:27:09.278 --> 00:27:10.619]  Here, turn up the liar again.
[00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:12.740]  Let's hear the new lie.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:19.485]  ...whose lives will be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here.
[00:27:19.485 --> 00:27:21.087]  There's no doubt that times are still tough.
[00:27:21.946 --> 00:27:25.489]  By no means are we out of the woods just yet.
[00:27:25.489 --> 00:27:30.653]  But from where we stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to see glimmers of hope.
[00:27:30.653 --> 00:27:39.620]  And beyond that, way off in the distance, we can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than our troubled economic past.
[00:27:41.783 --> 00:27:44.425]  It's an America teeming with new industry and commerce.
[00:27:44.425 --> 00:27:47.967]  Humming with new energy and discoveries that light the world once more.
[00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:48.668]  Oh my gosh.
[00:27:48.668 --> 00:27:55.692]  A place where anyone, from anywhere, with a good idea or the will to work, can live the dream they've heard so much about.
[00:27:55.692 --> 00:27:56.833]  Alright, stop it.
[00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:59.155]  That is- Shut him up for a minute.
[00:27:59.155 --> 00:27:59.615]  Uh, look.
[00:28:01.465 --> 00:28:04.666]  The Feds are taking over industries.
[00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:17.488]  The Feds are basically federalizing everything, saying, we have the trillions of dollars, we have the only credit, you've got to sign an agreement to do whatever we say, or do what these bureaucrats say, or do what this NGO, non-governmental organization says.
[00:28:17.488 --> 00:28:27.130]  And they are literally pumping, what, a couple billion dollars into ACORN, a couple billion dollars into other organizations, through the faith-based initiatives and the rest of it.
[00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.290]  They have their rent-a-mob.
[00:28:32.901 --> 00:28:39.084]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:41.345]  So let's hear CNN reporter Grovelington.
[00:28:41.345 --> 00:28:42.126]  Let's fade this up.
[00:28:43.612 --> 00:28:44.552]  We're good to go.
[00:29:10.797 --> 00:29:11.477]  That's enough.
[00:29:11.477 --> 00:29:13.158]  Turn that operative off.
[00:29:13.158 --> 00:29:13.799]  I've had enough.
[00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:15.780]  We're going to come back and take your calls.
[00:29:30.828 --> 00:29:31.929]  He's checking in with you.
[00:29:31.929 --> 00:29:33.590]  He really cares what you think.
[00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:38.774]  See, he builds up the hope, then dashes it, then builds the hope up, then dashes it.
[00:29:38.774 --> 00:29:42.077]  Keeps suckering the little kid into the car with the candy.
[00:29:42.077 --> 00:29:43.218]  Come here, little kid.
[00:29:43.218 --> 00:29:44.899]  Come here, American people.
[00:29:44.899 --> 00:29:46.521]  I care about you.
[00:29:46.521 --> 00:29:47.962]  Look, I have a little bunny.
[00:29:47.962 --> 00:29:51.404]  A little bunny rabbit and some candy.
[00:29:51.404 --> 00:29:52.786]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.786 --> 00:29:55.328]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.328 --> 00:29:58.050]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.090]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:08.931]  You might not be able to spell Constitution, but you sure know how important it is.
[00:30:08.931 --> 00:30:15.072]  You might not be missing any shirts from your closet, but you have given the shirt off your back hundreds of times.
[00:30:15.072 --> 00:30:20.373]  You might not understand the thousands of laws that exist, but you do live by the Ten Commandments.
[00:30:20.373 --> 00:30:26.654]  You might not know who the bad guys are, or what you should be complaining about, but you do know what to be thankful for.
[00:30:26.654 --> 00:30:30.415]  You might not be looking for a government handout, but you do know how to lend a helping
[00:30:32.162 --> 00:30:32.722]  We're good to go!
[00:31:01.815 --> 00:31:07.838]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.838 --> 00:31:13.720]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:19.883]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.223 --> 00:31:22.184]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.184 --> 00:31:24.645]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.645 --> 00:31:37.831]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.831 --> 00:31:39.512]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.512 --> 00:31:41.373]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:41.373 --> 00:31:47.596]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:32:42.626 --> 00:32:45.809]  Remember how they told you three years ago we weren't in a recession?
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:18.461]  Then they had to admit a year and a half later that we were.
[00:33:18.461 --> 00:33:21.622]  They keep promising you everything's gonna get better.
[00:33:21.622 --> 00:33:29.824]  Oh, they built FEMA camps, militarized the police, and the elites move out of Israel, the United States, and England.
[00:33:29.824 --> 00:33:34.664]  They plan to do things so bad here, they are evacuating, and that is a fact.
[00:33:34.664 --> 00:33:37.285]  That's even been in scores of mainline publications.
[00:33:56.995 --> 00:33:58.296]  But that's the psychology.
[00:33:58.296 --> 00:34:06.724]  He promises hope, change, everything will be fixed with the economy the minute he's elected.
[00:34:06.724 --> 00:34:07.885]  Then he gets into office.
[00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:19.024]  And he says, this crisis will turn into a catastrophe if you don't pass the stimulus package.
[00:34:19.024 --> 00:34:24.707]  It was well over a trillion dollars, a lot more than 787 billion.
[00:34:24.707 --> 00:34:33.711]  And they use that to buy off politicians, buy off the states, and fund all of their political cronies and the street thugs they're going to use to bring in their system.
[00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:38.173]  Of course, he supported the banker takeover bill of October 3rd last year, his main man,
[00:34:39.895 --> 00:34:48.019]  The head of the Treasury, Geithner, helped write the plan with Paulson, and he said, pass this or crisis will turn into catastrophe.
[00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:50.080]  Same thing.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.544]  Now they're done with the gloom and doom, now he's saying, go with my next plan to reorganize the economy and take over all these corporations.
[00:34:56.544 --> 00:34:57.804]  He calls that innovation.
[00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:00.646]  The government telling GM what type of cars to make.
[00:35:00.646 --> 00:35:01.686]  Have you seen these cars?
[00:35:01.686 --> 00:35:06.809]  I was watching crash tests with these this morning, and the rating services say these are the most dangerous cars ever.
[00:35:06.809 --> 00:35:08.670]  Even when you crash them into other tinker toy cars.
[00:35:09.625 --> 00:35:11.206]  He just kills you deader than a hammer.
[00:35:11.206 --> 00:35:12.927]  He might as well ride a motorcycle.
[00:35:12.927 --> 00:35:20.110]  And they're not, they're gonna basically make all the car manufacturers make little tinker toy cars that are basically motorcycles.
[00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.511]  And so I might as well go out and just buy a motorcycle.
[00:35:22.511 --> 00:35:31.496]  Which will kill you deader than a hammer and is so dangerous because the new cars are basically motorcycles with a tin can around them.
[00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:36.318]  And so, they are talking about now
[00:35:41.314 --> 00:35:43.756]  Making us, hey turn this up, Ron Paul!
[00:35:43.756 --> 00:35:47.539]  Fair deal, but I think this is going to be a bad deal and not help at all.
[00:35:47.539 --> 00:35:57.307]  But I don't blame him for the problems, I blame him for the prolongation of this because he was very explicit by saying that government should cut back on spending.
[00:35:57.307 --> 00:36:03.232]  He wants to massively increase the spending and therefore he's going to prolong it.
[00:36:03.632 --> 00:36:03.892]  I think so.
[00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:19.853]  There's
[00:36:35.015 --> 00:36:39.277]  He's absolutely wrong on that, because that is the understanding of the Depression.
[00:36:39.277 --> 00:36:42.819]  It was prolonged because of the intervention of Hoover and Roosevelt.
[00:36:42.819 --> 00:36:44.600]  Okay, Congresswoman, let me jump in and ask you this.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:55.385]  Do you believe the markets would have cleared away the wreckage, to use the President's words here, in our economy without the $787 billion stimulus package?
[00:36:59.093 --> 00:37:06.798]  Well, it wouldn't be completely done, but this way is going to go on for years and years, and they're going to destroy the dollar.
[00:37:06.798 --> 00:37:12.101]  I've used the analogy about a sound foundation, but the foundation should be on a sound dollar, and we don't.
[00:37:12.101 --> 00:37:13.803]  He never even mentioned the Federal Reserve.
[00:37:13.803 --> 00:37:20.167]  The only time he talked about money was, you know, if we create one dollar and put it in the bank, we're going to get seven or eight dollars.
[00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:21.848]  He's preaching inflation.
[00:37:22.248 --> 00:37:24.330]  And that's how you destroy the value of the dollar.
[00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.552]  That's actually the way you liquidate debt, too.
[00:37:26.552 --> 00:37:34.359]  Unfortunately, that is a tragic way of liquidating debt, because you punish those foolish people who are out saving money and planning for their future.
[00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:35.760]  They want to take care of themselves.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:42.906]  So we preach a deliberative policy of ruining the people who act fiscally responsible.
[00:37:42.906 --> 00:37:43.287]  Gotcha.
[00:37:43.287 --> 00:37:47.430]  So you clearly are suggesting that a different set of policies
[00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:49.172]  Well, I don't think.
[00:38:04.167 --> 00:38:11.749]  Okay, maybe General Motors went bankrupt in one year ago and somebody bought up the bad assets so they could get their house in order or something.
[00:38:11.749 --> 00:38:13.289]  Then we've been over and done with.
[00:38:13.289 --> 00:38:15.449]  And we'd be back buying their cars by now.
[00:38:15.449 --> 00:38:20.050]  Because right now we're not going to buy their cars because we don't know what the government's going to do to GM.
[00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:25.792]  So, in the same way with AIG... Did you suggest that to President Bush?
[00:38:25.792 --> 00:38:27.592]  Hey, GM's in trouble, let them go under?
[00:38:28.579 --> 00:38:31.960]  No, but that's why I said that Obama isn't to blame for all of this.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:37.242]  This has been a long time coming, and that's what we have to understand.
[00:38:37.242 --> 00:38:40.483]  It's Keynesian interventions, economics that we're pursuing.
[00:38:40.483 --> 00:38:44.224]  They went awry, and now all we're doing is accelerating it.
[00:38:44.224 --> 00:38:45.624]  It leads to a business.
[00:38:47.885 --> 00:38:52.931]  You know what, very few people will remember the context in which you use that word fascism.
[00:39:08.766 --> 00:39:12.789]  Is that responsible to toss that word around?
[00:39:12.789 --> 00:39:18.032]  Well, that is if you don't understand an economic fascist versus military fascism.
[00:39:18.032 --> 00:39:20.314]  And I'm not referring to military fascism.
[00:39:20.314 --> 00:39:22.855]  I'm strictly talking economic terms.
[00:39:22.855 --> 00:39:28.118]  And there is an economic fascism where government and business are partners.
[00:39:28.118 --> 00:39:31.460]  And when businesses get into trouble, they love it.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.903]  Is it the little guy that's going to have the tax rallies tomorrow?
[00:39:34.903 --> 00:39:35.263]  No!
[00:39:36.403 --> 00:39:37.804]  It's not the big guys.
[00:39:37.804 --> 00:39:39.384]  The big guys are getting all the benefits.
[00:39:39.384 --> 00:39:50.407]  The little guys are having the rebellion because they haven't received anything because they're sick of this type of partnership where the big guys get bailed out when times are good.
[00:39:50.407 --> 00:39:52.748]  They get low taxes and they make billions.
[00:39:52.748 --> 00:39:58.409]  But no, I think you have to understand there's a difference between economic fascism and military fascism.
[00:39:58.409 --> 00:40:02.470]  I wanted to at least give you an opportunity to expand on that statement.
[00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.071]  Congressman Paul, thanks for your time.
[00:40:04.071 --> 00:40:04.611]  We appreciate it.
[00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:05.311]  Thank you.
[00:40:05.311 --> 00:40:07.032]  Alright, folks.
[00:40:07.032 --> 00:40:10.634]  That's us popping in on the mainstream media to analyze their propaganda.
[00:40:10.634 --> 00:40:13.736]  Now, what's the big angle here?
[00:40:13.736 --> 00:40:16.257]  What should we take away from what we just heard?
[00:40:16.257 --> 00:40:27.303]  Why is CNN, MSNBC, Fox, and Culture says she loves Ron Paul, supports him, that he should be president in 2012?
[00:40:27.303 --> 00:40:28.984]  Why are they doing that?
[00:40:28.984 --> 00:40:33.647]  Because they do internal polling, not just the public propaganda polls they put out.
[00:40:34.761 --> 00:40:37.423]  They monitor all the digital cable boxes in the country.
[00:40:37.423 --> 00:40:40.886]  They know what you're watching, how long you're watching.
[00:40:40.886 --> 00:40:45.350]  They can build detailed psychological algorithms and maps off of that.
[00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:48.573]  And they know that we are now approaching the majority.
[00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:51.251]  In fact, I'm being conservative.
[00:40:51.251 --> 00:41:02.719]  I will tell you, if you put the ideas of Ron Paul, liberty, freedom, the ideas we put out on this radio show, next to what the globalists are doing, 80-90% of people in polls that have been done support us.
[00:41:02.719 --> 00:41:05.721]  So, we are winning the field.
[00:41:05.721 --> 00:41:10.084]  People are now waking up and agreeing with us.
[00:41:10.084 --> 00:41:11.245]  In droves, everywhere.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:22.648]  And so the establishment is at least trying to pay lip service to the public so they don't become completely obsolete.
[00:41:22.648 --> 00:41:26.431]  And so the public at least feels like our voice is being heard to some extent.
[00:41:26.431 --> 00:41:30.275]  This is called a steam valve.
[00:41:30.275 --> 00:41:36.181]  Folks, a year and a half ago, Ron Paul got more political contributions from both parties.
[00:41:36.181 --> 00:41:38.443]  From people calling themselves Republicans and Democrats.
[00:41:41.141 --> 00:41:46.963]  He got more political contributions than candidates in either party, Republican or Democrat.
[00:41:46.963 --> 00:41:54.725]  Across political lines, he got the most political contributions from across the political lines from the military.
[00:41:54.725 --> 00:42:02.268]  And then on several days, he broke all-time records, you know, six plus million dollars in one day, and they were small donations.
[00:42:06.408 --> 00:42:17.277]  So, we were already a huge, powerful, growing minority a year and a half ago, and so many people said, oh, Ron Paul didn't win, they cheated us, it's all over, you know, where's the money, Ron Paul?
[00:42:17.277 --> 00:42:30.227]  Well, they spent it all on TV ads and radio ads and print ads, and the government operatives tried to come in and say, look at Ron Paul, you know, we shouldn't have given him the money, it was all a failure, baloney.
[00:42:30.227 --> 00:42:31.989]  This happens incrementally.
[00:42:32.861 --> 00:42:39.085]  Just like the globalists built their system of control incrementally, we're going to counter them incrementally.
[00:42:39.085 --> 00:42:42.967]  And the idea of liberty is now the dominant force on college campuses.
[00:42:42.967 --> 00:42:45.609]  It's not communism, socialism, fascism.
[00:42:45.609 --> 00:42:54.935]  There are more people that identify with this radio show and InfoWars.com and Ron Paul and everybody else than even do with Barack Obama.
[00:42:55.933 --> 00:42:59.474]  Barack Obama is a Madison Avenue, corporately produced fraud.
[00:42:59.474 --> 00:43:05.095]  I mean, let's face it, he gets the really shallow, dumb, kind of football, baseball fans.
[00:43:05.095 --> 00:43:08.296]  You know, people that actually get into whether they like Coke or Pepsi.
[00:43:08.296 --> 00:43:12.257]  Just shallow, not even dumb, but focused on petty issues.
[00:43:12.257 --> 00:43:20.498]  Kind of the shallow population that never really been involved in politics, wasn't really informed, didn't like Bush, didn't like where the government's going.
[00:43:20.498 --> 00:43:22.959]  They took the Ron Paul liberty revolution
[00:43:24.445 --> 00:43:29.887]  That again, Ron Paul's just the one figurehead of.
[00:43:29.887 --> 00:43:34.348]  And they took that revolution that was brewing and said, okay, here's Barack Obama.
[00:43:34.348 --> 00:43:35.148]  He'll end the war.
[00:43:35.148 --> 00:43:35.808]  He'll do this.
[00:43:35.808 --> 00:43:36.249]  He'll do that.
[00:43:36.249 --> 00:43:37.809]  He'll go after corporate crime.
[00:43:37.809 --> 00:43:39.349]  He'll kick out the lobbyists.
[00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:44.731]  When he was funded by the corporate criminals, by the lobbyists, by the elites, by the powers that be.
[00:43:44.731 --> 00:43:50.093]  When his votes were all for that, we knew he was bad.
[00:43:50.093 --> 00:43:54.134]  And so now they've got him up there every day giving speeches, every day having press conferences.
[00:43:57.472 --> 00:44:01.017]  He's already given more speeches in two months than Bush gave in his first two years in office.
[00:44:04.056 --> 00:44:22.424]  He's out there selling and pushing their agenda 24-7, because the establishment knows they are losing the people, they are losing the credibility, they are losing their hold on the people's minds, and so they're going to trot Ron Paul out.
[00:44:22.424 --> 00:44:33.489]  Ron Paul's going to tell the truth, Ron Paul's going to do a great job, but they also like Ron Paul because he's safe to a certain extent, because he's a gentleman, because he says it all in a friendly way, and they think it's frankly not that effective.
[00:44:35.663 --> 00:44:39.546]  And then they're going to trot out on our flank, Glenn Beck.
[00:44:39.546 --> 00:44:43.629]  Look, I don't get into bashing Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh and all these guys.
[00:44:43.629 --> 00:44:46.291]  In a way, it even helps them, so I don't like doing it.
[00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:48.233]  And I don't like even turning off their fans.
[00:44:48.233 --> 00:44:52.496]  I'd rather them tune in here and find out, you know, the true depth of what's going on.
[00:44:54.485 --> 00:45:06.635]  But Beck has to be countered because we know he's an operative, and we know he's a Judas Goat, we know he's a Judas Iscariot, we know he's sent in to co-opt the movement and lead us down a rabbit trail.
[00:45:06.635 --> 00:45:10.818]  But they're doing that because they realize we are the majority now.
[00:45:10.818 --> 00:45:15.062]  They realize that we're winning the hearts and minds in the info war with the truth.
[00:45:18.288 --> 00:45:31.259]  They realize they're losing the military and the police, and so they want to keep people on Fox, keep them on CNN, keep them on all these channels.
[00:45:31.259 --> 00:45:38.765]  They want to keep them tuned in there so that people think there's a little bit of credibility there so they can sandwich in all the rest of their propaganda.
[00:45:40.802 --> 00:46:02.172]  But as people lose their jobs, as the CPS kidnaps more children, as more people die after they take vaccines, and this is happening everywhere, as more and more illegal aliens take jobs and murder and kill and steal and don't get in trouble, as more and more people get put in prison for smoking marijuana, as more and more people get angry at the system, it is going to come to an end.
[00:46:04.687 --> 00:46:07.848]  Now the globalists want to start new wars, stage terror attacks.
[00:46:07.848 --> 00:46:13.669]  They got a lot of curb balls they can throw to try to keep people on the reservation.
[00:46:13.669 --> 00:46:23.850]  To try to keep people going along with the system.
[00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:27.731]  To keep people rallying around their controllers, but I don't see it working.
[00:46:27.731 --> 00:46:30.532]  Okay, I was about to go to Rebecca, she just hung up.
[00:46:30.532 --> 00:46:32.172]  Let's go to Tom in Louisiana.
[00:46:32.172 --> 00:46:32.632]  Go ahead, Tom.
[00:46:35.299 --> 00:46:36.500]  Greetings, Alex.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:37.881]  Hi.
[00:46:37.881 --> 00:46:38.702]  How are you doing?
[00:46:38.702 --> 00:46:38.822]  Good.
[00:46:38.822 --> 00:46:42.364]  I'm calling from the great state of Louisiana.
[00:46:42.364 --> 00:46:50.671]  I just got an email about an hour and 15 minutes ago from our district senator at the first seat, Senator Crow.
[00:46:50.671 --> 00:46:59.077]  SRC 2 and SRC 5 are on the docket for the state legislature, which will be convening on April 27th.
[00:46:59.077 --> 00:47:01.179]  Both of them are separate state sovereignty bills.
[00:47:01.179 --> 00:47:03.060]  One's a broad 10th Amendment one.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.821]  The second one is
[00:47:04.764 --> 00:47:08.751]  In regards directly to abortion rights here in Louisiana.
[00:47:08.751 --> 00:47:12.898]  So I just wanted to call in and get the word out because he wants to get the word out and spread the word.
[00:47:12.898 --> 00:47:16.464]  I might even, if you'd like to talk to him or do an interview with him, I could probably get him for you.
[00:47:19.175 --> 00:47:20.135]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:47:20.135 --> 00:47:22.597]  I'll just send that to RobD at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:22.597 --> 00:47:36.403]  I'm glad you called, because I said I was going to cover this as our top story, and then I got distracted off into the tax man squeezing people into the edge of oblivion, or sometimes over the edge of oblivion, financially.
[00:47:36.403 --> 00:47:38.544]  But for those that don't know, wake up call!
[00:47:38.544 --> 00:47:47.328]  Texas Governor backs resolution affirming sovereignty, HCR 50, that by the way we got introduced, our listeners, called.
[00:47:47.328 --> 00:47:48.409]  We've had a state senator on.
[00:47:49.670 --> 00:48:16.452]  that push the idea uh... just a few states were calling for this our listeners got the ball rolling and this story broke nationally and now texas is on the verge of passing and you just mentioned uh... louisiana i know is very very close uh... and then at the same time we have south carolina and state sovereignty uh... on the verge of passing that and south dakota
[00:48:18.736 --> 00:48:28.905]  I hate to interrupt you.
[00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:36.792]  Did you notice on Governor Perry's website, the top story on there is his press release from, I think it was Thursday or Friday?
[00:48:36.792 --> 00:48:39.515]  Governor Perry backing the Texas Sovereignty Bill.
[00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:42.112]  Yes, that's being reported on.
[00:48:42.112 --> 00:48:49.596]  And notice when... This state sovereignty situation has been going on for 15 years, since 1994.
[00:48:49.596 --> 00:49:02.042]  But, you know, again, it's this audience that was able to break it out in the last three months to be a major story, to then get other states to start moving, now 30 plus states moving to declare sovereignty.
[00:49:02.042 --> 00:49:09.306]  And people told us, oh, you don't have a prayer, you don't have a hope, shut up, you know, there's... You can't do anything, we don't have any power.
[00:49:10.188 --> 00:49:13.430]  Now, a lot of those people aren't operatives, and I appreciate your call, Tom.
[00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.652]  They're not operatives, they just don't believe in themselves.
[00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:19.114]  They're broke back, they're cowed, they're buffaloed.
[00:49:19.114 --> 00:49:24.638]  They've been put in a corner, they've been made to lie down, they've been taught to give up.
[00:49:24.638 --> 00:49:26.580]  They've lost their fightin' spirit.
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.462]  If we get our fightin' spirit back, folks, nothing can stop us.
[00:49:29.462 --> 00:49:30.322]  It's real simple.
[00:49:30.322 --> 00:49:36.967]  We're in the right, the globalists are criminals in the wrong, and if we get past all their glitz and propaganda, we can bring them to justice.
[00:49:39.835 --> 00:49:42.616]  So the state sovereignty bills are moving ahead nicely.
[00:49:42.616 --> 00:49:45.997]  You know, go back to a month ago.
[00:49:45.997 --> 00:49:48.358]  We get the secret MIAC report.
[00:49:48.358 --> 00:49:50.539]  We publish it.
[00:49:50.539 --> 00:49:53.780]  For a week, people say I'm a liar, doesn't exist, isn't real.
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.801]  Doesn't matter if we call the state police.
[00:49:55.801 --> 00:49:59.522]  Doesn't matter if we air interviews with the state police admitting it.
[00:49:59.522 --> 00:50:02.583]  The globalists have to try to discredit me.
[00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:04.864]  And so I hit the barbed wire, I take all the blame.
[00:50:07.248 --> 00:50:09.809]  I take all the hits of people saying it's not real.
[00:50:09.809 --> 00:50:12.791]  That kind of sticks in people's minds.
[00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:20.916]  But now today, it's on all over TV, all over radio, all over Drudge Report, all over CNN.
[00:50:20.916 --> 00:50:23.797]  And now more and more police and military are leaking these reports.
[00:50:23.797 --> 00:50:29.060]  We're getting reports how the Army is spying on me, spying on Ron Paul.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:32.402]  The Army finds out about that, the rest of the Army who isn't part of it, they get upset.
[00:50:33.712 --> 00:50:35.773]  I mean, look, the globalists are out of control.
[00:50:35.773 --> 00:50:38.553]  The globalists are committing crimes.
[00:50:38.553 --> 00:50:43.094]  And so all we've got to do is point out the crimes they're committing, and this stuff can't stand.
[00:50:43.094 --> 00:50:49.836]  I mean, offshore banks run the government and have stolen $12.8 trillion that they think we're going to pay for in tax money?
[00:50:49.836 --> 00:50:52.997]  If we just tell the truth about this, it's over for the globalists.
[00:50:52.997 --> 00:50:56.698]  Matt, Chris, Don, Brian, your call straight ahead and a lot of other news.
[00:50:56.698 --> 00:50:57.118]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.272 --> 00:51:02.393]  Spring is here.
[00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:03.354]  Growing season.
[00:51:03.354 --> 00:51:05.556]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:51:05.556 --> 00:51:07.257]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:51:07.257 --> 00:51:08.238]  Think about it.
[00:51:08.238 --> 00:51:12.322]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:51:12.322 --> 00:51:16.085]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:51:16.085 --> 00:51:17.987]  The country is running out of food.
[00:51:17.987 --> 00:51:20.489]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.

[00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:59.932]  OrganicaSeed.com today.
[00:51:59.932 --> 00:52:03.654]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:52:04.269 --> 00:52:06.892]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:06.892 --> 00:52:14.461]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:52:14.461 --> 00:52:20.628]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.048 --> 00:52:23.009]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.009 --> 00:52:25.531]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.531 --> 00:52:37.099]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.099 --> 00:52:38.780]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.641]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:46.865]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.535 --> 00:52:55.808]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.808 --> 00:52:57.391]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.391 --> 00:52:58.572]  The people strike back!
[00:53:00.487 --> 00:53:04.729]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[00:53:04.729 --> 00:53:09.651]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[00:53:09.651 --> 00:53:12.212]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[00:53:12.212 --> 00:53:17.754]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.

[00:53:42.851 --> 00:53:44.412]  Debt relief experts are standing by.
[00:53:44.412 --> 00:53:46.453]  You have nothing to lose, except your credit card debt.
[00:53:46.453 --> 00:53:46.714]  Call 800-324-6554.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:15.929]  You know, I could care less about the fact that we hardly ever get credit for all the big news we break and all the original stories that we push over the edge into mainstream media.
[00:54:15.929 --> 00:54:17.550]  I don't care.
[00:54:19.821 --> 00:54:25.184]  Because the bigger I get, the more attention I get, actually, the more danger it puts me in with the New World Order.
[00:54:25.184 --> 00:54:36.349]  I just like operating right here at this level, right below their radar, going right at their midsection with a big double-edged dagger of truth.
[00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:38.750]  And I just keep stabbing and stabbing, plunging into the hill.
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.983]  I'm not waiting for orders from headquarters.
[00:54:42.983 --> 00:54:44.324]  And there's another example of it.
[00:54:44.324 --> 00:54:50.710]  I mean, literally everything you hear us break on this show ends up being mainstream news within days.
[00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:57.997]  Here is the... We posted this video over the weekend, Homeland Security warns of right-wing radicals.
[00:55:03.138 --> 00:55:05.159]  And Homeland Security warns of right-wing radicals.
[00:55:05.159 --> 00:55:09.780]  Nine-page report sent to police, military, vets, singled out as particular threats.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:13.141]  That is the top headline on Drudge.
[00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:14.281]  Up there flashing.
[00:55:14.281 --> 00:55:18.543]  Now remember, I get to be told it's fake, though.
[00:55:18.543 --> 00:55:20.703]  You know, a few little message boards had this.
[00:55:20.703 --> 00:55:23.564]  I make the phone calls over the weekend.
[00:55:23.564 --> 00:55:25.065]  I confirm it's Homeland Security.
[00:55:25.065 --> 00:55:27.105]  Nobody thought to call Homeland Security.
[00:55:27.105 --> 00:55:29.546]  Nobody thought to call the numbers on the document.
[00:55:29.546 --> 00:55:30.787]  They confirmed it was real.
[00:55:30.787 --> 00:55:31.647]  We put an article up.
[00:55:32.594 --> 00:55:36.216]  Kurt Nemo and I stay up till, you know, midnight writing the article, Sunday.
[00:55:36.216 --> 00:55:42.040]  We post it, and then we get to have everybody tell us, in the next 24 hours, it's fake!
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:42.921]  Go read the comments!
[00:55:42.921 --> 00:55:44.162]  Fake, fake, fake!
[00:55:44.162 --> 00:55:45.583]  Liar, liar, liar!
[00:55:45.583 --> 00:55:51.567]  Now the mainstream media's called and confirmed it's real.
[00:55:51.567 --> 00:55:55.089]  Over and over and over and over again, it breaks here.
[00:55:55.089 --> 00:55:58.832]  You hear it here first.
[00:55:58.832 --> 00:55:58.952]  And
[00:56:01.343 --> 00:56:08.544]  There is no doubt that we're beginning to have an effect and wake folks up.
[00:56:08.544 --> 00:56:12.505]  Homeland Security on guard for right-wing extremists, WorldNet Daily.
[00:56:12.505 --> 00:56:20.687]  WorldNet Daily, you know, they didn't mind Bush and his secret wiretappings of the torture of the police state of the Patriot Act going after citizens because it was Republican then.
[00:56:20.687 --> 00:56:23.107]  You know, it was okay.
[00:56:23.107 --> 00:56:25.748]  Now Obama's continuing it all and they can suddenly see it.
[00:56:26.584 --> 00:56:31.189]  But see then, as soon as Republicans get back in power, then it'll be okay again.
[00:56:31.189 --> 00:56:31.990]  No!
[00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:42.822]  We have to get around the left-right paradigm and say no matter who's in office, and I get hundreds of emails and comments a day and phone calls, you're a Republican, you just don't like Barack Obama.
[00:56:42.822 --> 00:56:45.325]  And that's because it's the discredited Republicans
[00:56:46.786 --> 00:56:54.389]  Who are a party to all of this, who then run around criticizing what they've authored today.
[00:56:54.389 --> 00:57:10.655]  It's like a quarterback who's in there for the first few downs, moving the ball down the field, and they pull him out, put another quarterback in, and then that quarterback makes a touchdown, and the quarterback who was in there acts like he's with the other team and says, that's just terrible, I hate it that he made a touchdown.
[00:57:10.655 --> 00:57:13.036]  You helped make the touchdown for the New World Order.
[00:57:14.153 --> 00:57:30.186]  All you Republicans out there who sappily said that Saddam had WMDs and Mission Accomplished and loved Bush up there in an aviator outfit with a codpiece and made you all feel manly and everything, you're now going to reap the high taxes, the regulations, the end of the country.
[00:57:30.186 --> 00:57:32.168]  Bush was just tripling government, getting it ready for
[00:57:33.922 --> 00:57:38.983]  I mean I'm looking, turn this up, CNN is running a Mexican, a marijuana and Mexican violence.
[00:57:55.188 --> 00:57:58.670]  You're funding the same people who are beheading... Turn them off!
[00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:59.671]  Turn them off!
[00:57:59.671 --> 00:58:01.952]  Listen to me, you drug-dealing government!
[00:58:01.952 --> 00:58:08.576]  Everybody knows you ship the heroin and cocaine in, and you know that 86% of illegal drug users only use marijuana.
[00:58:08.576 --> 00:58:13.639]  So you know your phony drug war would end if people were able to legalize marijuana that George Washington smoked.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:20.083]  The drug violence is happening because it's illegal, so it gives it giant profits, just like alcohol prohibition.
[00:58:20.083 --> 00:58:21.283]  And you know it!
[00:58:21.283 --> 00:58:27.326]  So now you want to keep cracking down on marijuana, claiming it's funding terrorism!
[00:58:27.326 --> 00:58:31.649]  And now you want to crack down on the Second Amendment, claiming it's funding what's happening in Mexico.
[00:58:31.649 --> 00:58:32.209]  No!
[00:58:32.209 --> 00:58:33.850]  It's your prohibition that's done it!
[00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:38.752]  Mexico has gun bans in place, so of course they have high crime!
[00:58:38.752 --> 00:58:41.974]  Ah, you make me sick!
[00:58:41.974 --> 00:58:43.275]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.824 --> 00:58:51.008]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.008 --> 00:58:51.628]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:52.689]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.689 --> 00:58:57.433]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.433 --> 00:59:00.395]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.395 --> 00:59:03.437]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.437 --> 00:59:09.302]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.522 --> 00:59:12.765]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.765 --> 00:59:19.752]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:19.752 --> 00:59:23.035]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:40.188 --> 00:59:42.169]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.709 --> 00:59:56.111]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.111 --> 01:00:05.539]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.539 --> 01:00:06.840]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.622]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.622 --> 01:00:10.383]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.383 --> 01:00:11.944]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.944 --> 01:00:13.526]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:17.709]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.709 --> 01:00:21.753]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.285 --> 01:00:44.233]  Alright, look, I gotta have you guys turn the monitor off in here because I'm busy watching CNN with just the subtitles and it's all lies.
[01:00:46.721 --> 01:00:53.262]  I mean, just watching a few minutes of CNN just now, let me break down what they were covering and what they were doing and the lies within lies.
[01:00:53.262 --> 01:00:56.623]  Just to give you an example of decoding this.
[01:00:56.623 --> 01:01:05.605]  They're saying, we've got to keep marijuana illegal, we've got to tie it to Al-Qaeda, they've already done ads to that, now tie it to Mexican violence and terrorism.
[01:01:05.605 --> 01:01:14.907]  If you smoke marijuana, you're funding Al-Qaeda and the Mexican drug gangs, and that's why police have got to still take you to jail and juries have still got to convict you, and we've got to put you in prison.
[01:01:17.779 --> 01:01:23.248]  Because, you know, if we don't do this, terrorists are going to kill us all.
[01:01:23.248 --> 01:01:26.012]  It's the fact that drugs are illegal.
[01:01:26.012 --> 01:01:31.340]  Eighty years ago, heroin, cocaine, opium, everything was for sale in drugstores.
[01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:40.555]  And the first thing they banned was marijuana, and they used the term marijuana, not hemp, because Americans, you know, didn't know what that was.
[01:01:40.555 --> 01:01:48.101]  And they advertised it as from Mexico, and they did newsreels about how it made you go psychopathic and kill everybody.
[01:01:48.101 --> 01:01:48.601]  I'm not kidding.
[01:01:48.601 --> 01:01:55.467]  There's a whole bunch of documentaries out showing these newsreels, not just Reefer Madness.
[01:01:55.467 --> 01:01:58.089]  But it would show you take a head off a joint and suddenly go murder your family.
[01:01:58.888 --> 01:02:04.452]  Uh, it was just weird when they made all these midget cowboys start murdering everybody in the town because they smoke marijuana.
[01:02:04.452 --> 01:02:06.093]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:02:06.093 --> 01:02:07.494]  The opposite of what marijuana does.
[01:02:07.494 --> 01:02:14.759]  It makes you want to sit down and eat enchiladas or something and watch TV and an entire half gallon of Blue Bell Dutch chocolate ice cream.
[01:02:14.759 --> 01:02:16.360]  At least a few times I've smoked marijuana.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.021]  That's what I felt like doing.
[01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:20.143]  So, uh, that's what's happening.
[01:02:20.143 --> 01:02:22.104]  It'll make you want to go out and kill people.
[01:02:22.104 --> 01:02:24.085]  Maybe alcohol sometimes.
[01:02:24.085 --> 01:02:26.147]  You know, cocaine, stuff like that, certainly sometimes.
[01:02:26.147 --> 01:02:27.788]  But the issue here
[01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:31.567]  This is asinine.
[01:02:31.567 --> 01:02:37.129]  You've got a whole generation of people, the average person's even 65, a smoked pot.
[01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:38.209]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:02:38.209 --> 01:02:39.069]  They know it's a lie.
[01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:43.791]  So now, not just that it's an evil drug, it's terrorism.
[01:02:43.791 --> 01:02:52.554]  And then they show the police in black ski masks and the dead bodies in Mexico and say, we've got to have even tougher laws on marijuana because it's causing all the violence.
[01:02:53.354 --> 01:03:04.341]  No, drug prohibition is causing all the violence and most marijuana is grown now in the United States because they have made it harder to get it over the border in past decades.
[01:03:04.341 --> 01:03:09.245]  And that's good because they don't spray it with Paraquad and the rest of the chemicals now, stuff grown here in the U.S.
[01:03:09.245 --> 01:03:15.249]  So, 86% of drug users, of illegal drug users, only use marijuana.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.860]  And they know that.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.261]  The establishment knows it's a fraud in the business.
[01:03:20.261 --> 01:03:23.622]  The government controls the cartels that ship in the heroin and cocaine.
[01:03:23.622 --> 01:03:27.683]  The few cartels they bust are the cartels not paying their cut.
[01:03:27.683 --> 01:03:31.885]  You got a big war against methamphetamine because that's a drug the government doesn't control.
[01:03:31.885 --> 01:03:38.827]  And by the government making amphetamines illegal, it's all the backyard made stuff where even the chemicals you make it with are controlled.
[01:03:38.827 --> 01:03:42.448]  So they've got to mix it with a bunch of other chemicals and it's full of poison.
[01:03:42.448 --> 01:03:45.749]  Anybody using crank or methamphetamine is insane.
[01:03:47.526 --> 01:03:52.109]  I mean, the pharmaceutical stuff will fry your brain from not getting enough sleep and aging.
[01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:54.731]  But you can go for 20, 30 years on that.
[01:03:54.731 --> 01:04:01.116]  Look at Kennedy, look at the Beatles, look at, you know, pharmaceutical methamphetamine with Elvis.
[01:04:01.116 --> 01:04:07.101]  But the stuff, the stuff you're buying out of trailers, that stuff will kill you better than a hammer.
[01:04:07.101 --> 01:04:08.922]  It'll give you an autoimmune disease.
[01:04:08.922 --> 01:04:11.744]  It'll kill your white blood cells.
[01:04:11.744 --> 01:04:12.445]  I mean, it's just deadly.
[01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:16.557]  So, but again, that's the government making it illegal.
[01:04:16.557 --> 01:04:18.777]  Thanks a lot, scumbags.
[01:04:18.777 --> 01:04:20.157]  You're causing all the carnage.
[01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:25.539]  Of course, these crank cookers are out of their minds.
[01:04:25.539 --> 01:04:30.020]  I mean, they're snorting heavy metals and grenadier reagents and every other poison you can imagine.
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.500]  But that's another side issue.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.161]  Then they cut to addiction in America.
[01:04:36.161 --> 01:04:39.982]  And then they cut to the ad, and it's a Prozac ad.
[01:04:39.982 --> 01:04:41.122]  Something even more deadly.
[01:04:42.236 --> 01:04:43.257]  Are you embarrassed by your legs?
[01:04:43.257 --> 01:04:44.658]  Are your legs sore and irritated?
[01:04:44.658 --> 01:04:48.782]  Millions of women suffer from leg pain due to varicose veins.
[01:05:09.179 --> 01:05:14.143]  When varicose veins prevent you from living and enjoying your everyday life, you need VaniLuxe.
[01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:19.648]  VaniLuxe is a dietary tool formulated to restore naturally beautiful legs from the inside out.
[01:05:19.648 --> 01:05:27.774]  As part of your healthy lifestyle, VaniLuxe promotes antioxidant action throughout your body to calm varicose veins and support fit legs for life.
[01:05:27.774 --> 01:05:33.939]  VaniLuxe has helped women all over the world relieve varicose vein pain and restore the confidence to bare their legs.
[01:05:33.939 --> 01:05:38.142]  Now it's your chance to benefit with VaniLuxe free when you call 1-888-VANILUXE.
[01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:41.464]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[01:06:04.693 --> 01:06:07.316]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.316 --> 01:06:14.906]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.906 --> 01:06:21.054]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.474 --> 01:06:23.455]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.455 --> 01:06:25.957]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:25.957 --> 01:06:37.523]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.523 --> 01:06:39.204]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.065]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:47.289]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:47.961 --> 01:06:56.226]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.226 --> 01:06:57.807]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.807 --> 01:07:01.008]  The people strike back.
[01:07:01.008 --> 01:07:04.450]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:08.693]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:07:08.693 --> 01:07:16.657]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:07:16.937 --> 01:07:17.357]  We're good to go!
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.861]  Big Brother!
[01:08:07.032 --> 01:08:08.793]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.554]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:12.134]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.134 --> 01:08:13.695]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.695 --> 01:08:17.897]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.897 --> 01:08:22.459]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.459 --> 01:08:25.080]  Hi, let's go back to your calls.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.882]  Gotta get a report on the upcoming Bilderberg Group meeting in about 20 minutes, then we've got, uh...
[01:08:31.877 --> 01:08:36.618]  An economist joining us to cover what happened in Argentina, what the bankers did there by design.
[01:08:36.618 --> 01:08:40.559]  Kind of a test run for the United States, Iceland, and other countries.
[01:08:40.559 --> 01:08:41.839]  Let's talk to Chris in Georgia.
[01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:45.200]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:45.860]  Alex.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.400]  Yes, sir.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.802]  You remember Marcus down in Morrow, Georgia?
[01:08:52.802 --> 01:08:56.443]  You know, you had him on the show.
[01:08:56.443 --> 01:08:57.723]  You've got a Remarcus who?
[01:08:59.059 --> 01:09:03.022]  Marcus Williams, you had him on the show.
[01:09:03.022 --> 01:09:06.065]  Yeah, sure, Marcus Williams from the Nubian Bookstore.
[01:09:06.065 --> 01:09:07.046]  Yeah, sure.
[01:09:07.046 --> 01:09:17.674]  Yeah, well, I was talking to him and he got the 200 DVDs and I'm in Clarkston, Georgia and I've been working on Parks and the One Mile Diameter City.
[01:09:17.674 --> 01:09:26.802]  I've been working on Clarkston for several years now and my idea is to make a presentation of Obama Deception DVDs to the police chief.
[01:09:27.742 --> 01:09:38.729]  The mayor, six city council people, um, city attorney, city clerk, and I'm just kind of conducting an experiment in my own city with awareness raising.
[01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:45.714]  I was wondering if maybe, well, maybe you could pay attention to that one a little bit.
[01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.756]  Pay attention to what a little bit?
[01:09:47.756 --> 01:09:54.560]  Well, this little experiment of ours here with a small city in Georgia and maybe a little focus.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.862]  I know you've got a full plate.
[01:09:56.862 --> 01:09:56.982]  Um,
[01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:07.973]  So I'm going to get these DVDs from Marcus and present them to the whole city council and see what the effects are and I'll report back to you.
[01:10:07.973 --> 01:10:15.936]  But one of the questions I wanted to ask about taxes was, did she say anything about Sherry Jackson?
[01:10:15.936 --> 01:10:17.096]  She's in prison now.
[01:10:17.096 --> 01:10:22.918]  She was the IRS whistleblower, IRS agent whistleblower and she's in prison now.
[01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:25.639]  I was at her trial and I didn't know if
[01:10:26.317 --> 01:10:28.899]  I missed part of Joe Bannister's discussion.
[01:10:28.899 --> 01:10:33.783]  No, we've had her on the show before, and of course they set her up and sent her to prison for her free speech.
[01:10:33.783 --> 01:10:34.623]  That's how they operate.
[01:10:34.623 --> 01:10:37.225]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:10:37.225 --> 01:10:45.752]  You know, I sent 200 free DVDs to that bookstore, and I have given a bunch of other people free DVDs.
[01:10:45.752 --> 01:10:48.153]  We don't really toot our horn about it here.
[01:10:48.153 --> 01:10:52.857]  I mean, if somebody gave me $50 million, I would give 50 million free DVDs out.
[01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:55.863]  I mean, that's how we operate.
[01:10:55.863 --> 01:10:58.805]  The goal is unlocking hearts and minds.
[01:10:58.805 --> 01:11:02.026]  Everything is about hearts and minds.
[01:11:02.026 --> 01:11:03.827]  Everything is about reversing the globalists.
[01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:12.092]  I mean, just last night I was surfing around YouTube, and it was worse than I even thought.
[01:11:12.092 --> 01:11:18.475]  I found all these clips where they had CPS workers admitting that they get paid bounties to kidnap people's kids.
[01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:21.757]  I mean, I knew they were doing that, but to have them brag about it,
[01:11:24.312 --> 01:11:27.993]  Perhaps we'll play some of those clips later if I have time.
[01:11:27.993 --> 01:11:36.535]  I mean, just on that issue alone, and how it's not real courts, and how they're above the law and they're arrogant.
[01:11:36.535 --> 01:11:39.476]  People are like, what does the Obama deception have to do with that?
[01:11:39.476 --> 01:11:40.136]  That's what I mean.
[01:11:40.136 --> 01:11:42.977]  It's just, the government is bad, folks.
[01:11:42.977 --> 01:11:45.697]  I'm done trying to explain it to people.
[01:11:45.697 --> 01:11:46.738]  I mean, I say I'm done.
[01:11:49.289 --> 01:11:50.730]  I just live this constantly.
[01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:51.850]  I study it constantly.
[01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:53.711]  I know about their crimes.
[01:11:53.711 --> 01:11:56.033]  And then people email me and go, oh, you're exaggerating.
[01:11:56.033 --> 01:11:57.753]  Government isn't as bad as you say.
[01:11:57.753 --> 01:11:59.995]  Folks, I can't tell you how bad they are.
[01:11:59.995 --> 01:12:06.278]  I can't even articulate or explain how out of control this system is.
[01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:08.599]  And all I think about is the children.
[01:12:08.599 --> 01:12:15.843]  I mean, I think about how the globalist in government textbooks that we've posted and documented and linked to and done articles on, all these textbooks,
[01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:21.214]  Where they say, we want to break up the family, we want to end the family.
[01:12:21.214 --> 01:12:29.001]  The government's job is to break up the family and break up the middle class and break up businesses and bankrupt the economy so that everybody works for the New World Order.
[01:12:29.001 --> 01:12:34.125]  I mean, this is cold-blooded conquering humanity, conquering the species.
[01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:42.132]  The scientific dictatorship just doesn't roll in with tanks and take over your government and occupy your nation and put in some puppet front men.
[01:12:43.749 --> 01:12:59.160]  The scientific dictatorship brainwashes you with TV, poisons you in the food and water, breaks up your families, gets you domesticated, gets you on the plantation, and then gives you soft-kill weapons through the food and water and vaccines.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.904]  I mean, they are killing us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:04.904 --> 01:13:06.645]  And sure, you know, I would expose
[01:13:08.643 --> 01:13:15.207]  Ten years ago, in 1999, government documents saying gun owners, constitutionalists, were terrorists.
[01:13:15.207 --> 01:13:18.629]  And I'd have people call me and say that document's fake.
[01:13:18.629 --> 01:13:19.389]  But you know what?
[01:13:19.389 --> 01:13:21.891]  Ten years later, people aren't saying they're fake now.
[01:13:21.891 --> 01:13:24.512]  People know.
[01:13:24.512 --> 01:13:31.296]  And people can laugh at me about saying 9-11 was an inside job seven and a half years ago.
[01:13:31.296 --> 01:13:32.337]  But they're not laughing now.
[01:13:35.094 --> 01:13:38.835]  9-11 Commission Council government agreed to lie about 9-11.
[01:13:38.835 --> 01:13:40.855]  And I want this guy on.
[01:13:40.855 --> 01:13:41.755]  Red Alert.
[01:13:41.755 --> 01:13:49.637]  New book from man tasked by government to help investigate attacks unveils how official story is almost entirely untrue.
[01:13:49.637 --> 01:13:51.998]  And he says they made a deal with the Pentagon to lie to the public.
[01:13:51.998 --> 01:13:55.438]  That's coming up later.
[01:13:55.438 --> 01:13:58.659]  Yeah, even if you really think 19 guys from caves did this,
[01:14:01.368 --> 01:14:02.888]  Commanded from caves.
[01:14:02.888 --> 01:14:06.349]  But from Saudi Arabia, but then Iraq had to be attacked.
[01:14:06.349 --> 01:14:12.110]  I mean, if you really believe that, still, the official story is a lie.
[01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:13.690]  That's the point we've always made.
[01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:16.751]  Even if you believe the official story.
[01:14:16.751 --> 01:14:23.412]  You know, that it was 19 guys, and the government didn't know, and didn't stand down, and, you know, even let it happen on purpose.
[01:14:23.412 --> 01:14:27.473]  Well, the LiHop, instead of made it happen on purpose, did it.
[01:14:27.473 --> 01:14:30.153]  LiHops let it happen on purpose, MiHop made it happen on purpose.
[01:14:33.789 --> 01:14:38.973]  I mean, even if you... I mean, do you respect yourselves enough to admit there's army manuals on how to stage terror attacks?
[01:14:38.973 --> 01:14:47.820]  That our military's taught this as a tool like their canteen or rifle?
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:54.084]  I mean, do you understand there's over two hundred examples of our government staging terror where they admit they did it?
[01:14:54.084 --> 01:14:55.705]  These people don't play games.
[01:14:55.705 --> 01:15:01.069]  Life means nothing to them.
[01:15:01.069 --> 01:15:02.911]  You think the globalists didn't care about
[01:15:04.198 --> 01:15:12.763]  A half million Japanese they killed in one day dropping A-bombs on them after they'd already tried to surrender unconditionally, but you think they care about you?
[01:15:12.763 --> 01:15:23.150]  Because you wear a John Deere cap and drive a truck and strut around listening to George Strait even though you're all hat and no cattle?
[01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:28.854]  You think because you're a black person who likes Barack Obama the New World Order cares about you and wants to take care of you?
[01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:32.415]  I mean, look, stop being suckers, folks!
[01:15:32.415 --> 01:15:34.455]  These people want you dead!
[01:15:34.455 --> 01:15:36.756]  You got that?
[01:15:36.756 --> 01:15:42.437]  And we have trailblazed everything.
[01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.458]  We trailblazed here.
[01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:46.918]  Putting Ron Paul on the map.
[01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:50.739]  And Ron Paul, without me asking him, has said that on air.
[01:15:50.739 --> 01:15:55.860]  I get respect from Ron Paul, but not from his would-be handlers.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.481]  And I don't expect the respect.
[01:15:57.481 --> 01:15:58.061]  I don't care.
[01:15:59.224 --> 01:16:06.968]  I know that to be the first to say something, or the first to do something, or the first to stick your head up, you get your head whacked.
[01:16:06.968 --> 01:16:08.628]  But I don't care.
[01:16:08.628 --> 01:16:21.054]  But I do expect all of you to realize the amount of power you have, and the amount of change you can affect, and the amount of good you can do, and the amount of light you can bring into the world.
[01:16:21.054 --> 01:16:24.536]  Because I'm just a regular guy from Texas.
[01:16:25.785 --> 01:16:34.007]  Who didn't like gun control and open borders and police state, who learned that the Federal Reserve was an oligarchy ruling our country 15 years ago.
[01:16:34.007 --> 01:16:39.709]  And I got on air 14 years ago.
[01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:47.110]  And I went out and found others and we developed and built the alternative media system.
[01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:49.551]  We were the first doing alternative radio.
[01:16:49.551 --> 01:16:51.892]  I was doing alternative radio in 1995 on the internet.
[01:16:55.643 --> 01:16:57.984]  We were the first to trailblaze viral videos.
[01:16:57.984 --> 01:17:03.387]  We were the first to go out and take over press conferences and confront politicians and their little hoaxes.
[01:17:03.387 --> 01:17:07.349]  We wrote the book on the paradigm shift.
[01:17:07.349 --> 01:17:11.851]  And we did it not even knowing we were rewriting the paradigm.
[01:17:11.851 --> 01:17:13.052]  Expanding the paradigm.
[01:17:13.052 --> 01:17:14.773]  Unlocking the paradigm.
[01:17:14.773 --> 01:17:16.394]  Shifting the paradigm.
[01:17:16.394 --> 01:17:24.518]  We just took action and I took every little angle and every little way I could to break into the media and affect change.
[01:17:26.479 --> 01:17:27.839]  And we've had a great effect.
[01:17:27.839 --> 01:17:31.301]  So don't for a minute think that you can't be a great leader.
[01:17:31.301 --> 01:17:34.762]  That you can't start a radio show, or website, or make films.
[01:17:34.762 --> 01:17:39.543]  But whatever you do, don't overanalyze it and try to make your first work perfect.
[01:17:39.543 --> 01:17:40.424]  Nothing's perfect.
[01:17:40.424 --> 01:17:42.544]  Just take action, get in the fight.
[01:17:42.544 --> 01:17:46.205]  Who's up next here?
[01:17:46.205 --> 01:17:49.467]  Don in Alabama, you're on the air.
[01:17:49.467 --> 01:17:50.547]  Yes, Alex.
[01:17:50.547 --> 01:17:50.807]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:51.756 --> 01:17:53.897]  Oh, the Obama Deception, great film.
[01:17:53.897 --> 01:18:01.720]  Out of a hundred people, well, a bunch more than a hundred, but out of a hundred people, I'll say 90% of the people that's watching is waking up.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.341]  Oh, were these formerly Kool-Aid drinkers?
[01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:05.361]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:18:05.361 --> 01:18:10.603]  Those two words you mentioned a while ago, paradigm shift, I remember when it happened to me.
[01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:17.926]  I heard this ranting and raving guy back in 2000 named Alex Jones on a shortwave radio, he mentioned a paradigm.
[01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:20.067]  I never even thought about what paradigm meant.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.881]  Woke me up.
[01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:23.421]  Absolutely.
[01:18:23.421 --> 01:18:24.322]  Well, I shifted my paradigm.
[01:18:24.322 --> 01:18:25.622]  And I praise God for it.
[01:18:25.622 --> 01:18:26.503]  Well, praise God for you.
[01:18:26.503 --> 01:18:27.723]  What's going on?
[01:18:27.723 --> 01:18:32.846]  Well, we started a radio show down here in Ozark, right outside of Fort Rooker two years ago.
[01:18:32.846 --> 01:18:36.348]  They shut the radio station down.
[01:18:36.348 --> 01:18:38.449]  Somebody bought it off on the website.
[01:18:38.449 --> 01:18:39.810]  It says, Hostile Takeover.
[01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:43.091]  I don't know exactly who bought it, but you can't get anything anymore on there.
[01:18:43.091 --> 01:18:47.573]  We started the American Constitutional radio broadcast down here.
[01:18:47.573 --> 01:18:49.755]  I called you a couple years ago and told you we were going to do it.
[01:18:49.755 --> 01:18:50.135]  We did it.
[01:18:50.973 --> 01:18:52.954]  Bunch of folks are waking up, Alex.
[01:18:52.954 --> 01:18:53.614]  That's okay.
[01:18:53.614 --> 01:18:55.434]  Find another local radio station.
[01:18:55.434 --> 01:18:56.215]  Do whatever you have to.
[01:18:56.215 --> 01:18:57.755]  Get on AXS TV.
[01:18:57.755 --> 01:19:05.678]  Because, again, we're little media, but people never heard anything like this, and so it packs a lot of punch.
[01:19:05.678 --> 01:19:09.079]  We're like cyanide to the New World Order.
[01:19:09.079 --> 01:19:11.499]  There's no doubt about that whatsoever.
[01:19:11.499 --> 01:19:17.481]  I do most of my time trying to slap these Christians awake down here, and it's starting to work a little bit.
[01:19:17.481 --> 01:19:19.282]  Try and get them past Romans 13,
[01:19:20.544 --> 01:19:24.048]  And if you can get them past that, they will wake up.
[01:19:24.048 --> 01:19:26.650]  Absolutely, my friend.
[01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:27.751]  It has been a blessing.
[01:19:27.751 --> 01:19:30.714]  It's been a blessing getting out there doing something.
[01:19:30.714 --> 01:19:33.838]  Not just sitting back letting the world pass you by.
[01:19:35.248 --> 01:19:38.290]  Absolutely.
[01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:38.610]  Stay there.
[01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:42.713]  I want to hear from you about how fulfilling it was when you started taking action.
[01:19:42.713 --> 01:19:46.115]  Because, folks, there's nothing like it on Earth.
[01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:53.881]  Once you start fighting evil, once you just get past the fear and commit to doing this job, you really start living.
[01:19:53.881 --> 01:19:56.462]  And you really start understanding what life's all about.
[01:19:56.462 --> 01:19:57.203]  Stay there, Don.
[01:19:57.203 --> 01:19:58.124]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:19:58.124 --> 01:19:59.945]  Then Brian, Dan, Craig, and others.
[01:20:01.124 --> 01:20:07.106]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:07.866]  Think about that.
[01:20:07.866 --> 01:20:10.967]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[01:20:10.967 --> 01:20:14.189]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:23.992]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.
[01:20:24.432 --> 01:20:30.257]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[01:20:30.257 --> 01:20:31.437]  The choice is yours.
[01:20:31.437 --> 01:20:37.062]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[01:20:37.062 --> 01:20:42.126]  Choose for Health, the world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[01:20:42.126 --> 01:20:45.688]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.
[01:20:45.688 --> 01:20:48.711]  1-800-210-1922.

[01:20:53.975 --> 01:20:55.938]  In the New World Order's war against humanity.
[01:21:04.955 --> 01:21:07.796]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:13.677]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.677 --> 01:21:20.179]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:20.179 --> 01:21:22.159]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:22.159 --> 01:21:24.620]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:34.342]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[01:21:34.822 --> 01:21:37.803]  That's fascism.
[01:21:37.803 --> 01:21:39.464]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.464 --> 01:21:41.325]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:41.325 --> 01:21:48.228]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:48.228 --> 01:21:56.492]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:56.492 --> 01:21:58.072]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:58.072 --> 01:21:59.273]  The people strike back.
[01:22:00.876 --> 01:22:07.564]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.564 --> 01:22:15.673]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.673 --> 01:22:21.260]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.841]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:22:23.841 --> 01:22:28.923]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.923 --> 01:22:34.146]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.

[01:23:49.172 --> 01:23:50.192]  And wish 10, 15, 20 years from now
[01:24:15.285 --> 01:24:17.446]  That you'd have done something when you had a chance.
[01:24:17.446 --> 01:24:29.151]  World government is moving upon the planet with all of its darkness.
[01:24:29.151 --> 01:24:31.592]  They're in the wrong, we're in the right.
[01:24:31.592 --> 01:24:34.874]  Are you gonna stand up against them?
[01:24:34.874 --> 01:24:39.256]  Or will you surrender to oppression and bondage?
[01:24:41.345 --> 01:24:48.168]  That is a question you have to decide for yourself, but choose wisely and choose quickly as well.
[01:24:48.168 --> 01:24:49.488]  We don't have a lot of time.
[01:24:49.488 --> 01:24:50.689]  Don in Alabama, finish up.
[01:24:50.689 --> 01:24:54.271]  So, what was it like once you got empowered and took action?
[01:24:54.271 --> 01:25:01.974]  Well, it made a lot of enemies to start with, but the people that did turn over to being my friends, they're friends for life.
[01:25:01.974 --> 01:25:03.354]  And they want to do something.
[01:25:03.354 --> 01:25:04.715]  They're eager to know the truth.
[01:25:06.198 --> 01:25:11.840]  And I point him out, I try to do everything I can do, mainly give him a Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:17.682]  And I point him to you and Steve Quayle, because Steve Quayle is one of the other ones that woke me up also.
[01:25:17.682 --> 01:25:21.263]  Oh, by the way, if you get a chance, get him back soon, please, on the radio.
[01:25:21.263 --> 01:25:22.744]  Yeah, we'll get him back on in a minute to do that.
[01:25:22.744 --> 01:25:23.684]  Thank you for the call.
[01:25:23.684 --> 01:25:24.845]  I need to go on his show as well.
[01:25:24.845 --> 01:25:27.966]  I know he's been inviting me, I've just been so busy.
[01:25:27.966 --> 01:25:30.146]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:25:30.146 --> 01:25:33.048]  Let's talk to Brian in Canada.
[01:25:33.048 --> 01:25:33.928]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:25:34.673 --> 01:25:36.114]  Hi Alex, how's it going?
[01:25:36.114 --> 01:25:37.995]  Good, sir.
[01:25:37.995 --> 01:25:45.681]  I was calling you today just to let you know that I heard a funny report about them two weeks ago when they had the incident in New York.
[01:25:45.681 --> 01:25:50.824]  I was driving to pick up my wife in the afternoon and they were reporting it on CBC Radio.
[01:25:50.824 --> 01:25:51.225]  The incident?
[01:25:51.225 --> 01:25:55.087]  They were talking to a man in the area that was freaking out.
[01:25:55.087 --> 01:25:56.969]  So I'm listening very intently.
[01:25:56.969 --> 01:25:57.789]  The man's freaking out.
[01:25:57.789 --> 01:25:59.210]  He says, I don't get it.
[01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:01.052]  There's something going on here.
[01:26:01.052 --> 01:26:04.374]  He says there's military here and they're not supposed to have any military here.
[01:26:05.049 --> 01:26:09.674]  And he says then they're telling us that it's one man with a gun and he's killed himself.
[01:26:09.674 --> 01:26:13.137]  But I just saw them bring two men out in handcuffs.
[01:26:13.137 --> 01:26:15.059]  And they're not telling us nothing.
[01:26:15.059 --> 01:26:16.560]  So I took note of that.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.481]  Not much more of that.
[01:26:17.481 --> 01:26:18.142]  Alright, let me stop you.
[01:26:19.201 --> 01:26:22.604]  A lot of people probably didn't put two and two together because it took me a minute to click.
[01:26:22.604 --> 01:26:40.437]  You're talking about the shooting in New York a week and a half ago that we've had eyewitnesses on the show that talked about how the news helicopter was there before the shooting started and then it's now been confirmed that supposedly this guy couldn't write.
[01:26:40.437 --> 01:26:46.942]  His sister was on Good Morning America and did say that it was fake and that he couldn't write English.
[01:26:47.682 --> 01:26:57.829]  So you got this fake letter and just like with Columbine and other things, there are reports of other shooters, but you're saying you heard this on CBC, Brian?
[01:26:57.829 --> 01:26:58.890]  Yeah, I heard it live.
[01:26:58.890 --> 01:27:04.154]  The man was, he was very upset about it and he was saying that they're, they're hiding something from us.
[01:27:04.154 --> 01:27:14.161]  And I didn't think much more of it until two days later when I heard that Al Qaeda had actually taken responsibility for it and they had claimed that they used two guys to do it.
[01:27:15.532 --> 01:27:17.334]  It kind of fit one plus one.
[01:27:17.334 --> 01:27:18.896]  It was kind of strange.
[01:27:18.896 --> 01:27:27.405]  I've been wanting to mention that to you for a while now, because I already know from 9-11, you listen to the very first reports, and then about after an hour, you give up.
[01:27:27.405 --> 01:27:31.149]  Because it's one story that comes out, that's when the bull starts, you know?
[01:27:31.149 --> 01:27:34.712]  Well, I mean, the very first few reports, usually you get a sense.
[01:27:34.712 --> 01:27:36.835]  Listen, Building 7, for those that don't know,
[01:27:38.203 --> 01:27:44.690]  BBC went on two separate BBC channels and simultaneously at the exact same minute said the exact same thing.
[01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:49.555]  So we said that's a script, probably Reuters, because that's who's their main feed.
[01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:59.925]  And it turned out it was an internal news feed sent to them 25 minutes before Building 7 fell, reporting exactly how it fell in its own footprint.
[01:28:00.946 --> 01:28:03.287]  Uh, and with the fake cover story.
[01:28:03.287 --> 01:28:05.188]  And then we said, BBC, why'd you do that?
[01:28:05.188 --> 01:28:07.308]  And they said, we lost the tapes, we won't say.
[01:28:07.308 --> 01:28:10.629]  And I on record said, I believe it was a news feed.
[01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:15.171]  Then they admitted last year in their own documentary that indeed it was a Reuters news feed.
[01:28:15.171 --> 01:28:15.591]  So again,
[01:28:16.031 --> 01:28:32.080]  Red handed, red handed staging and scripting that just like they were reporting hours before they caught Lee Harvey Oswald because of time zone mistake they made in New Zealand and other places that Lee Harvey Oswald had been caught
[01:28:33.288 --> 01:28:34.709]  Uh, in Dallas.
[01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:36.270]  So, they did it, period.
[01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:41.494]  They killed Kennedy, they carried out 9-11, that's just one little piece of thousands of pieces of evidence.
[01:28:41.494 --> 01:28:52.583]  And, uh, yes, uh, with the evidence we have, uh, it is very, very suspicious, uh, and of course that's a lie other than a lie saying Al-Qaeda did it, uh, and...
[01:28:53.363 --> 01:28:55.645]  Let me explain what they do here.
[01:28:55.645 --> 01:29:00.488]  We've had a bunch of fake terror attacks that have been staged that were not announced to the public.
[01:29:00.488 --> 01:29:03.831]  Blowing up refineries, shooting people.
[01:29:03.831 --> 01:29:06.693]  And then they tell police, listen this is classified.
[01:29:08.507 --> 01:29:11.129]  But Al-Qaeda is hitting us and hitting us hard.
[01:29:11.129 --> 01:29:13.171]  That's why we've got to have army checkpoints.
[01:29:13.171 --> 01:29:15.152]  That's why we've got to get ready for martial law.
[01:29:15.152 --> 01:29:18.334]  The public will panic if they think Al-Qaeda is really attacking.
[01:29:18.334 --> 01:29:20.716]  We have to keep this secret from the public.
[01:29:20.716 --> 01:29:28.022]  And now the police are compromised into intelligence operations believing that the government's actually good.
[01:29:28.022 --> 01:29:30.704]  So you understand there's staged fake terror attacks.
[01:29:32.216 --> 01:29:35.518]  And then there's the big staged attacks that are fake that they give attention to.
[01:29:35.518 --> 01:29:36.659]  Do you hear what I'm saying?
[01:29:36.659 --> 01:29:37.540]  Absolutely.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:40.282]  Well listen, you gotta get me that CBC report.
[01:29:40.282 --> 01:29:41.943]  Folks have gotta get that out of the archives.
[01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:46.026]  If you can confirm that, we can get the ball rolling exposing these murderers.
[01:29:46.026 --> 01:29:46.827]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:46.827 --> 01:29:49.088]  Yeah, I have no doubt that was staged in New York.
[01:29:49.088 --> 01:29:51.610]  The one in Pittsburgh probably too.
[01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:53.011]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.011 --> 01:29:55.533]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.533 --> 01:29:58.215]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.670 --> 01:30:02.570]  You worry.
[01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:04.651]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:30:04.651 --> 01:30:07.291]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:30:07.291 --> 01:30:09.412]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:30:09.412 --> 01:30:11.032]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:30:11.032 --> 01:30:14.613]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:30:14.613 --> 01:30:19.854]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:30:19.854 --> 01:30:23.834]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:30:23.834 --> 01:30:25.515]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:30:25.515 --> 01:30:28.415]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:30:28.415 --> 01:30:31.356]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:40.506]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:30:40.506 --> 01:30:45.329]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:30:45.329 --> 01:30:49.352]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[01:30:49.352 --> 01:30:53.374]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:30:53.374 --> 01:30:54.755]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:30:54.755 --> 01:30:56.476]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:31:01.753 --> 01:31:07.559]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.559 --> 01:31:15.147]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:15.147 --> 01:31:21.313]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.713 --> 01:31:23.694]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.694 --> 01:31:26.195]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:26.195 --> 01:31:37.780]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:39.461]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.461 --> 01:31:41.302]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:41.302 --> 01:31:47.525]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:56.474 --> 01:31:58.056]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:58.056 --> 01:31:59.258]  The people strike back!
[01:32:01.527 --> 01:32:02.368]  We're good to go.
[01:32:19.875 --> 01:32:20.855]  We're good to go.
[01:32:49.585 --> 01:32:52.807]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[01:32:52.807 --> 01:32:55.329]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[01:32:55.329 --> 01:33:05.096]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[01:33:05.096 --> 01:33:10.200]  Day after day, alone on a hill.
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.941]  Coming up, more your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:17.895 --> 01:33:25.643]  Governor Rick Perry, the Bilderberg Group member, the globalist, the guy who's been on my show and called me a big fat hog.
[01:33:25.643 --> 01:33:28.626]  In fact, pull up Rick Perry on the show.
[01:33:28.626 --> 01:33:31.069]  Maybe we'll play that letter.
[01:33:31.069 --> 01:33:40.459]  I believe that our federal government has become oppressive in its size, its intrusion into our lives of our citizens, and its interference with the affairs of our state.
[01:33:41.604 --> 01:33:42.945]  Governor Perry said.
[01:33:42.945 --> 01:33:50.950]  That is why I'm here today to express unwavering support for efforts all across our country to reaffirm the state's rights, affirm the Tenth Amendment to the U.S.
[01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:52.131]  Constitution.
[01:33:52.131 --> 01:33:54.793]  I believe that returning to the letter and the spirit of the U.S.
[01:33:54.793 --> 01:34:01.057]  Constitution and its essential Tenth Amendment will free our states from the undue regulations and ultimately strengthen our union.
[01:34:04.261 --> 01:34:06.863]  Perry continued, millions of Texans are tired of Washington, D.C.
[01:34:06.863 --> 01:34:09.545]  trying to come down here and tell us how to run Texas.
[01:34:09.545 --> 01:34:17.712]  But meanwhile, he's handing our roads over to the bankers, he's forcing merc shots on the girls of a vaccine-killing people.
[01:34:17.712 --> 01:34:20.734]  He went to Bilderberg Group, illegally.
[01:34:20.734 --> 01:34:25.218]  He's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:34:25.218 --> 01:34:28.060]  But this is still incredibly positive!
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.902]  CNN, Ron Paul, every day.
[01:34:31.314 --> 01:34:32.995]  Fox, constantly acting like us.
[01:34:32.995 --> 01:34:37.298]  Ann Coulter saying she's anti-New World Order after saying it didn't exist.
[01:34:37.298 --> 01:34:40.100]  Rick Perry coming out and saying we gotta deal with Washington.
[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:42.102]  That's because he doesn't have a choice!
[01:34:42.102 --> 01:34:44.584]  The whole legislature of Texas is moving!
[01:34:44.584 --> 01:34:51.248]  South Dakota just passed a strong states' rights resolution.
[01:34:51.248 --> 01:34:58.974]  It's a cease and desist order to the federal government, H.R. 1013.
[01:35:01.986 --> 01:35:03.828]  It's happening!
[01:35:03.828 --> 01:35:07.230]  And again, who gets the credit?
[01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:10.873]  Glenn Beck.
[01:35:10.873 --> 01:35:16.178]  Gets up and talks about how the states are dangerous, moving, declaring sovereignty.
[01:35:16.178 --> 01:35:16.918]  I get attacked.
[01:35:16.918 --> 01:35:20.821]  The Mayak Report demonizes the state sovereignty movement.
[01:35:20.821 --> 01:35:25.605]  The 2009 Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment demonizes it.
[01:35:25.605 --> 01:35:29.969]  What is all this anti-terrorism for?
[01:35:29.969 --> 01:35:31.210]  It's for the American people.
[01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:36.231]  They're now saying our military, our veterans are the number one threat.
[01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:37.651]  Gun owners are the number one threat.
[01:35:37.651 --> 01:35:50.613]  Homeland Security, all of it, was built for us to have the offshore banks steal everything we own and make sure we don't ever get back control of the government to bring the bankers to justice.
[01:35:50.613 --> 01:35:55.474]  The police and the military are just a rearguard action now for the bankers to rob us.
[01:35:55.474 --> 01:35:58.254]  And I want the police to know why they're going to lose their standard of living.
[01:35:58.254 --> 01:35:59.755]  I want the military to know that.
[01:35:59.755 --> 01:36:01.095]  Your enemy's the bankers.
[01:36:01.095 --> 01:36:01.915]  They run the country.
[01:36:02.952 --> 01:36:04.133]  I'm going to cover more of that.
[01:36:04.133 --> 01:36:12.421]  We're going to get Jim Tucker, written for some of the largest syndicated columns in newspapers, been in newspaper work for almost 50 years.
[01:36:12.421 --> 01:36:13.782]  Writes for American Free Press.
[01:36:13.782 --> 01:36:14.843]  He is the original guy.
[01:36:16.206 --> 01:36:16.667]  We're good to go.
[01:36:37.554 --> 01:36:44.855]  Politico now writes about how it's real and how it runs things and sources Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:36:44.855 --> 01:36:47.896]  Again, they've gone from saying it doesn't exist to existing.
[01:36:47.896 --> 01:36:52.657]  And Jim, sometimes two, three, four years before something happens is able to predict what's going to happen.
[01:36:52.657 --> 01:36:56.097]  He said, you know, four years ago gas is going to go to $150 a barrel.
[01:36:56.097 --> 01:36:57.998]  Goldberg says so within the next three years.
[01:36:57.998 --> 01:36:59.178]  It happened.
[01:36:59.178 --> 01:37:05.519]  He said three years ago they're going to pop the subprime mortgage and implode the derivatives crisis to bring in their world government.
[01:37:08.137 --> 01:37:11.359]  It happened two years later.
[01:37:11.359 --> 01:37:15.782]  He said George Bush is going to come out and endorse the Kyoto Protocol on Global Warming.
[01:37:15.782 --> 01:37:16.922]  Everybody laughed at him.
[01:37:16.922 --> 01:37:21.205]  A month later, Bush did it.
[01:37:21.205 --> 01:37:21.705]  Why?
[01:37:21.705 --> 01:37:27.389]  Because the Bilderberg Group is the 125 most powerful people in the world.
[01:37:27.389 --> 01:37:29.310]  They've got other steering meetings and things they engage in.
[01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:31.631]  That's all they do is fly around micromanaging everything.
[01:37:31.631 --> 01:37:33.693]  People say, well, why do they fly around?
[01:37:33.693 --> 01:37:35.574]  Well, the mafia doesn't talk over the telephone.
[01:37:36.519 --> 01:37:38.000]  They do it in person.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.922]  They've already got their system in operation running.
[01:37:39.922 --> 01:37:43.506]  They just fine-tune things like a Mafia Commission meeting.
[01:37:43.506 --> 01:37:47.229]  And so joining us is Jim Tucker.
[01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:52.494]  And we carry his book at InfoWars.com, by the way, on the Bilderberg Group.
[01:37:52.494 --> 01:37:53.815]  Excellent book.
[01:37:53.815 --> 01:37:55.677]  Jim Tucker, good to have you on.
[01:37:55.677 --> 01:37:57.459]  My pleasure as usual.
[01:37:57.459 --> 01:37:59.421]  Okay, give us the latest on Bilderberg.
[01:37:59.421 --> 01:38:01.623]  You believe you've found the location of it coming up?
[01:38:02.661 --> 01:38:15.267]  Yes, in Boulameni, Greece, which is concrete-to-concrete with Athens, at the, uh, I can never pronounce the name, the Avistar Park Resort.
[01:38:15.267 --> 01:38:18.629]  They met there in 1993, they're going back this year.
[01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:19.169]  May 14-17.
[01:38:19.169 --> 01:38:24.992]  Okay, have you talked to any of your sources?
[01:38:24.992 --> 01:38:27.694]  Do you know what's on the agenda this time?
[01:38:27.694 --> 01:38:29.014]  Uh, yes.
[01:38:29.014 --> 01:38:31.135]  Two people involved in international finance.
[01:38:32.921 --> 01:38:50.832]  Believe that the Bilderbergs are going to celebrate, that is, celebrate the economic crisis which they may very well have helped generate for the purpose of creating more global power to international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank.
[01:38:50.832 --> 01:38:55.976]  Sort of makes them a global treasury department.
[01:38:55.976 --> 01:39:01.279]  And of course their regular agenda is always
[01:39:02.017 --> 01:39:13.120]  The same as far as evolving the United Nations into a world government, which to some extent it is now.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.040]  Well, Jim Tucker, I want to stop you right there.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:26.223]  Now, please be very, very specific for the listeners.
[01:39:26.223 --> 01:39:28.964]  Okay, for the folks out there listening.
[01:39:28.964 --> 01:39:30.764]  Be very, very specific.
[01:39:32.893 --> 01:39:39.975]  Okay, specifically, I think the listeners are aware that we're in an economic crisis worldwide.
[01:39:39.975 --> 01:39:46.917]  The Bilderberg people may very well have created this crisis themselves for their own selfish purposes.
[01:39:46.917 --> 01:39:50.578]  They're going to exploit it for their own selfish purposes.
[01:39:50.578 --> 01:40:02.101]  It will give them more muscle to generate a type of World Treasury Department, another wing of the United Nations.
[01:40:04.595 --> 01:40:24.861]  Still another significant step closer to a world government, which the UN has effectively become anyway with the... Now that NATO years ago... In fact, on the occasion of their 50th anniversary, 10 years ago, NATO celebrated its role as the UN Standing Army.
[01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:26.562]  You could even read that in the Washington Post.
[01:40:26.562 --> 01:40:30.943]  There's two different paragraphs, one on page one and one deep inside on there.
[01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:36.614]  Uh, NATO story because the celebration of the 50th was in Washington, D.C.
[01:40:36.614 --> 01:40:39.276]  It was a big story locally and worldwide.
[01:40:39.276 --> 01:40:56.290]  In one paragraph, they, uh, celebrated the fact that the first time NATO forces fired a shot in anger, it was in Kosovo, uh, not according to as their charter dictates, in defense of, uh, Western Europe against a potential Soviet attack.
[01:40:58.858 --> 01:41:16.031]  Way down deep in the story on the side where the story jumped, they quoted one of the heads of state as saying that of course NATO would only send its military to areas as directed by the UN.
[01:41:16.031 --> 01:41:22.756]  You put the two paragraphs together and NATO for ten years has been the standing army of the United Nations.
[01:41:22.756 --> 01:41:26.299]  It will go anywhere in the world on the orders of the UN Security Council.
[01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:35.417]  And of course they're also working on eliminating local currency.
[01:41:35.417 --> 01:41:40.020]  The dollar is to become the emeryo.
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.302]  It has to expand throughout the Western Hemisphere.
[01:41:42.302 --> 01:41:47.066]  And it evolves into an American Union similar to the European Union.
[01:41:47.728 --> 01:41:49.790]  Jim, stop right there for a moment.
[01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:51.851]  Let's walk through this for a second.
[01:41:51.851 --> 01:41:58.496]  I want to go back, going back to almost three years ago, Bilderberg 2006.
[01:41:58.496 --> 01:42:02.779]  We're in the bar, I'm interviewing you and Daniel Estelin with your Bilderberg sources inside.
[01:42:02.779 --> 01:42:06.382]  Danny and you talk about how they're planning an engineered collapse.
[01:42:07.282 --> 01:42:07.682]  I don't
[01:42:27.478 --> 01:42:32.402]  And others bragging that the oil crisis is contrived to lower the price to bankrupt their enemies.
[01:42:32.402 --> 01:42:37.426]  He also told a bunch of newspapers that, hey, I'm having a great crisis.
[01:42:37.426 --> 01:42:39.268]  This is the culmination of my life.
[01:42:39.268 --> 01:42:42.250]  We're getting all this power and control out of imploding the economy.
[01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:43.692]  So they're openly bragging
[01:42:44.332 --> 01:42:47.213]  That they love what's happening and that they helped engineer it.
[01:42:47.213 --> 01:42:58.737]  Specifically, though, Jim Tucker, you're saying Bilderberg is going to celebrate the fact that the crisis is bringing in their new world order.
[01:42:58.737 --> 01:43:08.240]  Yes, that's according, as I said, to two people heavily involved in international finance and who are intimately aware of Bilderberg.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:11.221]  I wish I could name the sources out loud, but for obvious reasons I cannot.
[01:43:12.199 --> 01:43:13.200]  No, no, we understand.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.942]  You're proving your sources are impeccable, Jim.
[01:43:15.942 --> 01:43:19.424]  I mean, we've gone from them saying Bilderberg didn't exist to them now having met it.
[01:43:19.424 --> 01:43:33.934]  What is it like to go from the point of, this was denied, you were insane, you were schizophrenic, there was no such thing as a global elite, much less a Bilderberg group, with the media covering it up, to now, it's getting more and more attention.
[01:43:33.934 --> 01:43:36.335]  Well, it's been a process over the years.
[01:43:36.335 --> 01:43:40.138]  It was, I believe in Helsinki, maybe 13 years ago,
[01:43:41.424 --> 01:43:49.610]  We found out where Bilderberg was going to be situated, where they were going to meet and win quite early that year, I think November or something.
[01:43:49.610 --> 01:44:06.182]  So we had an advance story in the spotlight, the grand papy of American Free Press, and our European readers, of which circulation is limited of course in Europe because of the high cost of postage and so forth, so one subscription is likely to be shared by 20 people.
[01:44:06.182 --> 01:44:08.003]  So our readers in Helsinki,
[01:44:08.627 --> 01:44:08.967]  I think?
[01:44:39.033 --> 01:44:46.375]  Media, broadcast, TV, radio, and newspapers and news magazines have been all over Bilderberg.
[01:44:46.375 --> 01:44:52.036]  I'm talking about major daily newspapers from London and Paris and elsewhere.
[01:44:52.036 --> 01:44:59.278]  I'll give page one heavy treatment.
[01:44:59.278 --> 01:45:08.040]  They work very hard out there, widely known in Europe, but the blackout is still 100% in the United States, with the exception of course of American Free Press.
[01:45:08.718 --> 01:45:36.381]  And as you observed at the meeting in Chantilly a few years ago, the independent press, like the small newspaper that's independently owned in a small town, our independently owned radio station, our TV station, we had quite a number of those people turn out for Billerberg and Chantilly, but you never see the New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, or any of the wire services because they have attended these meetings and they took their oath of secrecy.
[01:45:39.609 --> 01:46:00.460]  Jim, like you said, there's still almost a complete media blackout here in the United States, but we are starting to actually see a few articles about Bilderberg, but now they're saying, oh, we don't really run anything, and then Wikipedia deletes the Bilderberg account, and then they say it doesn't exist, just like they say New World Order doesn't exist because it's CIA run, and they also
[01:46:01.721 --> 01:46:12.745]  Deleted the Bilderberg list from 2008 in Chantilly, saying that even though Bilderberg released that, they couldn't prove that was theirs, so it didn't exist either.
[01:46:12.745 --> 01:46:24.630]  So we have this crazy paradox where world government's being admitted now by the globalists themselves, Time Magazine, Newsweek announcing New World Order, Bank of the World, to control the planet, regulate every facet of our lives.
[01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:37.573]  But then we still have some pockets of media saying, no, it does not exist, and we have all these federal MIAC reports and others saying we're insane and dangerous terrorists if we believe in a global elite.
[01:46:39.082 --> 01:46:43.264]  Well, Chuck, if you vote Republican, you might be considered a terrorist.
[01:46:43.264 --> 01:46:57.691]  Well, we'll have more of this next edition of the newspaper, where the government's report saying that conservatives and right-wingers are terrorist threats, along with the child molesters.
[01:46:57.691 --> 01:46:58.952]  Oh, and veterans, too!
[01:46:58.952 --> 01:47:01.213]  It just says all the veterans are terrorists, yeah.
[01:47:01.213 --> 01:47:08.577]  Yeah, we'll be reporting on this next issue, not directly related to Bilderberg, of course,
[01:47:09.742 --> 01:47:11.963]  But you were talking about how it evolved in this country.
[01:47:11.963 --> 01:47:17.045]  It was the late, great Westbrook Pegler who first reported it in two columns in 1957.
[01:47:17.045 --> 01:47:26.129]  Bilderberg's first meeting under the name Bilderberg was in 1954, before they got their name at the Bilderberg Hotel.
[01:47:26.129 --> 01:47:28.671]  No, no, I mean, I know, and we put that in endgame.
[01:47:28.671 --> 01:47:32.292]  I understand that he did two reports on it, but it's Jim.
[01:47:32.292 --> 01:47:36.134]  It's you that followed him around for 30 plus years and broke it out of the popular culture.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.963]  Well, yes, Pegler did not use the term Bill Burr.
[01:47:39.963 --> 01:47:42.345]  He did not know that's what they call themselves.
[01:47:42.345 --> 01:47:54.497]  He just addressed at great length the matter of the world-famous, distinguished men from around all over Europe and the United States meeting in secret and raised the questions, why would they meet in secret?
[01:47:54.497 --> 01:47:55.998]  What even are they up to?
[01:47:55.998 --> 01:47:57.780]  Now, Jim, can you speak to this?
[01:47:58.991 --> 01:48:02.192]  We had people going before Congress in the early fifties.
[01:48:02.192 --> 01:48:26.141]  We had people going before Congress and saying there's a thing called La Cosa Nostra, the mafia, they meet in secret commission meetings, in farmhouses, and in remote areas, they control the United States, they make billions of dollars a year, they've paid off the police and the judges, and then the guy on their payroll comes out, the FBI director, and says it's a conspiracy theory, there is no such thing as organized crime.
[01:48:27.021 --> 01:48:28.382]  And that's the same thing.
[01:48:28.382 --> 01:48:32.005]  You were saying, hey, here's the real organized crime.
[01:48:32.005 --> 01:48:36.187]  Here's the real WASP and Israeli Mafia and others meeting.
[01:48:36.187 --> 01:48:38.049]  It's called the Bilderberg Group.
[01:48:38.049 --> 01:48:43.272]  And they just said no, just like the FBI director said no, it doesn't exist.
[01:48:43.272 --> 01:48:47.995]  Because once you exist, once you admit there's a Mafia, then you've got to talk about it.
[01:48:47.995 --> 01:48:56.521]  Can you make the parallel between denying there was a Mafia, which people would laugh at now today, towards denying that there was a global elite?
[01:48:58.202 --> 01:49:24.971]  Well, certainly, I remember pointing out to FBI agents who were helping the guard Bilderberg in some European place, I think Germany some years ago, along with their own, well, you've been there, you know how they have sometimes the military deployed in European countries, but a host of armed and uniformed guards backed up by plainclothes guards, in this case backed up by the FBI, and I explained to the FBI man that the Americans meeting at this meeting
[01:49:26.201 --> 01:49:31.403]  Uh, where criminals are, uh, they're in violation of the, uh, Logan Act.
[01:49:31.403 --> 01:49:36.904]  And, uh, he, they said, uh, yes, but you could not arrest them on foreign soil.
[01:49:36.904 --> 01:49:40.705]  So I said, well, next time they meet North America, you can come out and grab them.
[01:49:40.705 --> 01:49:54.249]  But, uh, oh, sure, they know they exist because they're, they're, uh, the FBI was there to guard them along with, uh, secret servicemen from the, uh, uh, uniformed secret servicemen and plainclothes secret servicemen.
[01:49:54.249 --> 01:49:55.730]  Uh, they could not deny they're there.
[01:49:56.790 --> 01:50:08.454]  People often talk about, ask me why I believe in a conspiracy theory, and I say I don't report on conspiracy theories, I report on conspiracy facts.
[01:50:08.454 --> 01:50:13.776]  And any way you can define, Webster defines conspiracy, Bilderberg meets the definition.
[01:50:13.776 --> 01:50:17.038]  No, they absolutely do.
[01:50:17.038 --> 01:50:22.420]  Even if you want to say they do good work and we should all be grateful, we of the unwashed multitude should be grateful.
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:25.721]  If you want to take that absurd view, you still have to acknowledge conspiracy.
[01:50:27.113 --> 01:50:39.683]  But see, if they can play the game like the FBI did and say, Mafia doesn't exist, organized crime doesn't exist, then
[01:50:41.465 --> 01:50:49.569]  You can just neutralize the whole debate and the child-like public says, okay, bad men don't exist, there's no organized crime.
[01:50:49.569 --> 01:50:52.111]  Just like they deny the government brings in most of the drugs.
[01:50:52.111 --> 01:50:53.731]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:50:53.731 --> 01:50:55.713]  When it's documented fact.
[01:50:55.713 --> 01:50:56.533]  Jim Tucker, stay there.
[01:50:56.533 --> 01:51:00.175]  I want to come back and talk more about what's on the agenda in Greece and the date.
[01:51:01.696 --> 01:51:03.697]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:51:03.697 --> 01:51:10.639]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:51:10.639 --> 01:51:19.041]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:51:19.041 --> 01:51:24.763]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:51:24.943 --> 01:51:26.784]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:51:26.784 --> 01:51:29.085]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:51:29.085 --> 01:51:33.508]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:51:33.508 --> 01:51:35.729]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:52:01.828 --> 01:52:07.092]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.848 --> 01:52:13.730]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.730 --> 01:52:20.232]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.232 --> 01:52:22.213]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.213 --> 01:52:24.653]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.653 --> 01:52:35.557]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.859 --> 01:52:39.520]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:41.382]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:41.382 --> 01:52:48.287]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:54:04.599 --> 01:54:07.981]  I'm reading the headline up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:54:07.981 --> 01:54:14.885]  Does Perry's support of 10th Amendment Bill make him a dangerous right-wing extremist or terrorist?
[01:54:14.885 --> 01:54:16.666]  According to the federal government, yes.
[01:54:16.666 --> 01:54:22.850]  If you believe in states' rights, key parties, liberty, freedom, 2nd Amendment, if you buy firearms and ammo,
[01:54:24.537 --> 01:54:30.221]  The federal document that we broke over the weekend states you are the number one threat to law enforcement.
[01:54:30.221 --> 01:54:31.922]  You are a terrorist.
[01:54:31.922 --> 01:54:33.363]  So are the veterans coming home.
[01:54:33.363 --> 01:54:35.124]  It states it right there.
[01:54:35.124 --> 01:54:38.186]  These are the criminals that run our country.
[01:54:38.186 --> 01:54:43.630]  Going back to Jim Tucker, what is the date of Bilderberg this year in Greece?
[01:54:43.630 --> 01:54:45.491]  How have you learned so early?
[01:54:45.491 --> 01:54:47.853]  Normally you're learning just a week or two before.
[01:54:47.853 --> 01:54:53.957]  They also sometimes, you know, try to put out disinformation, Jim, but you've always been accurate.
[01:54:55.267 --> 01:55:07.990]  Peggy, how do you know so early?
[01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:21.234]  Well, we start working on it in January when they start getting their letters, although they've delayed some of their letters to try to prevent leaks.
[01:55:21.234 --> 01:55:24.295]  My collaborators who help every year get to work on it.
[01:55:25.888 --> 01:55:27.491]  Jim, you're out of breath.
[01:55:27.491 --> 01:55:31.418]  Did you run outside and smoke a cigarette?
[01:55:40.419 --> 01:55:44.982]  Hey, stay five more minutes with us in the next hour, because I want to, I mean, let's have some levity.
[01:55:44.982 --> 01:55:46.843]  What are those cigarettes I've bummed off you?
[01:55:46.843 --> 01:55:53.587]  I've since quit, but you don't have filters on them, or what you call tampons.
[01:55:53.587 --> 01:55:57.889]  No, I never smoked tampon-tipped cigarettes.
[01:55:57.889 --> 01:56:03.773]  Okay, Jim is a real character, folks, a real classic straw-headed journalist.
[01:56:03.773 --> 01:56:06.134]  Jim, what are those devilish cigarettes you smoke?
[01:56:09.741 --> 01:56:15.344]  Well, they're imitation pill mills.
[01:56:15.344 --> 01:56:35.834]  In Virginia, they've got stores, and I don't own any stock in the stores, so I'm not promoting any financial interest here, but chain of stores that invented new cigarettes from new companies that have not signed off on that, got off 47 state settlements.
[01:56:35.834 --> 01:56:38.475]  They don't have to pay any of those millions of dollars a year.
[01:56:39.622 --> 01:56:54.821]  And until the turkeys in Congress increase cigarette taxes by 62 cents a pack, jerking food off the tables of starving Negro children in doing so, they cost $1.70 a carton, or $1.70 each, $17 a carton.
[01:57:00.933 --> 01:57:01.573]  Well, that's true.
[01:57:01.573 --> 01:57:06.176]  It really does hit inner cities and poor folks even worse with these out-of-control taxes.
[01:57:06.176 --> 01:57:07.877]  It doesn't make people quit smoking.
[01:57:07.877 --> 01:57:11.778]  But Jim, those are some mean cigarettes you smoke.
[01:57:11.778 --> 01:57:12.779]  That is tough stuff.
[01:57:12.779 --> 01:57:22.124]  I mean, you smoke the most harsh cigarettes I've ever seen, and you can, like, almost pull one down, the whole cigarette in one big drag.
[01:57:22.124 --> 01:57:24.925]  You are something special.
[01:57:24.925 --> 01:57:26.546]  Well, I go jogging every day, too, of course.
[01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:34.672]  Folks, if you don't know Tucker behind the scenes, he is a real character.
[01:57:34.672 --> 01:57:36.253]  We ought to make a film just about you, Jim.
[01:57:36.253 --> 01:57:37.934]  Okay, listen.
[01:57:37.934 --> 01:57:38.614]  I digress.
[01:57:38.614 --> 01:57:39.194]  I apologize.
[01:57:39.194 --> 01:57:40.395]  I want you to do five more minutes with us.
[01:57:40.395 --> 01:57:43.797]  We're going to break for one minute here in a second, and let's get serious.
[01:57:43.797 --> 01:57:46.978]  So what is the date of Bilderberg 2009 again?
[01:57:46.978 --> 01:57:50.781]  May 14, 17.
[01:57:50.781 --> 01:57:53.322]  And that's in a suburb of Athens?
[01:57:53.322 --> 01:57:56.183]  Yes, a town called Voulamini.
[01:57:56.183 --> 01:57:58.345]  Voulamini.
[01:57:58.345 --> 01:57:58.585]  Yeah.
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:01.482]  So they are celebrating.
[01:58:01.482 --> 01:58:04.885]  I mean, we have some of the Bilderberg members in public celebrating.
[01:58:04.885 --> 01:58:08.229]  I wonder why they're so arrogant, why they love hurting people and bankrupting them.
[01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:10.631]  I guess they like power.
[01:58:10.631 --> 01:58:14.935]  Yes, when you're that filthy rich, money is power.
[01:58:14.935 --> 01:58:23.324]  I mean, there's only so many homes you can sleep in, only so many yachts you can cruise on, so many private airplanes that one person could possibly use.
[01:58:29.801 --> 01:58:32.763]  So they enjoy taking money from us.
[01:58:32.763 --> 01:58:33.584]  It's devastating.
[01:58:33.584 --> 01:58:35.165]  It's economic warfare.
[01:58:35.165 --> 01:58:36.226]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:36.226 --> 01:58:37.347]  We're coming back in one minute, Jim.
[01:58:37.347 --> 01:58:38.808]  No time to smoke cigarettes.
[01:58:38.808 --> 01:58:40.049]  Stay there.
[01:58:40.049 --> 01:58:46.314]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.308 --> 01:58:52.989]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.989 --> 01:58:57.730]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:00.692]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.692 --> 01:59:03.733]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.733 --> 01:59:09.595]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.815 --> 01:59:13.058]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:13.058 --> 01:59:20.043]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:59:54.153 --> 01:59:56.554]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.554 --> 02:00:05.816]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.816 --> 02:00:07.116]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.116 --> 02:00:08.897]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.897 --> 02:00:10.637]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.637 --> 02:00:12.218]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.218 --> 02:00:13.798]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.798 --> 02:00:17.959]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.959 --> 02:00:20.300]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:21.218 --> 02:00:22.799]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.799 --> 02:00:28.781]  We're gonna go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus seven minutes, basically.
[02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:30.822]  Basically seven and a half minutes there.
[02:00:30.822 --> 02:00:31.322]  Precise.
[02:00:31.322 --> 02:00:36.384]  Uh, we're gonna open the phones up, we're gonna do a bunch of news, play this Rick Perry clip.
[02:00:36.384 --> 02:00:39.545]  Why, it's like Alex Jones is now the governor of Texas!
[02:00:40.586 --> 02:00:44.369]  I mean, it sounds like I'm up there, but we know Rick Perry better than that.
[02:00:44.369 --> 02:00:58.281]  Jim Tucker, what do you think of Rick Perry suddenly says he wants to fight the globalists and the feds are oppressive and we're going to declare Tenth Amendment sovereignty, Fox News is talking about the New World Order, CNN is talking about the New World Order and populism.
[02:00:58.281 --> 02:01:08.769]  I mean, what is it like for you to be a patriot anti-New World Order for forty-something years and now see, as the New World Order is openly announced, more and more people are having to
[02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:21.418]  Yes, none dare call it Bilderberg, but I'm glad to see the public become more aware of these international intrigues.
[02:01:21.418 --> 02:01:25.000]  In fact, Bilderberg's been on the loose again for some time now.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.721]  We have calls to celebrate.
[02:01:28.172 --> 02:01:38.174]  Years ago, Bill O'Berg assured himself, I think about 1980-something, that we'd have the American Union in place, fully in place, by the year 2000.
[02:01:38.174 --> 02:01:43.415]  That approach, they had to set the goal back a little bit, and now back still further.
[02:01:43.415 --> 02:01:48.556]  The public becomes outraged when they become aware of it.
[02:01:48.556 --> 02:01:52.437]  You just mentioned some of the indications that they're aware of it.
[02:01:52.437 --> 02:01:56.258]  Your governor, who attended Bill O'Berg, made all of his promises.
[02:01:56.258 --> 02:01:57.718]  He's buckling under public pressure.
[02:01:58.363 --> 02:02:23.449]  So, uh, and you've also seen, uh, increasing, and this disturbs Bilderberg very much, uh, increasing popularity of so-called protectionism, where, uh, we equalize trade at the water's edge, where you cannot, where, uh, Americans are saying, do not dump on us, uh,
[02:02:25.686 --> 02:02:29.671]  Some are even talking about bringing back the Smith-Hawley Act.
[02:02:29.671 --> 02:02:39.963]  But see Jim, that's the intel we're getting is the bankers said, okay, we're not able to ban their guns yet, we're not able to legalize all the illegals yet.
[02:02:39.963 --> 02:02:44.848]  Let's fully destroy the economies of the West, then the people will be so bankrupt
[02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:51.091]  They'll just be glad they're not starving in the street like Argentina, and then they'll go along with our orders.
[02:02:51.091 --> 02:02:59.773]  And so basically, they're just destroying the entire economy out of spite to try to get their world government through this crisis.
[02:02:59.773 --> 02:03:02.534]  Yes, that's certainly true.
[02:03:02.534 --> 02:03:05.775]  But I... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:03:05.775 --> 02:03:13.577]  But again, these are acts of desperation when they set these goals and they're unable to meet these goals.
[02:03:14.062 --> 02:03:21.246]  And they see a rise in nationalism, which is a dirty word, to Bill Burr.
[02:03:21.246 --> 02:03:25.568]  They're citizens of the world, as your President calls himself, a citizen of the world.
[02:03:25.568 --> 02:03:42.538]  Obama, of course, as you know, is a Bill Burr recruit, and all Presidents have had, since Eisenhower, have had somebody attend Bill Burr meetings for the White House to report back on what the President's new orders are for the coming year.
[02:03:43.343 --> 02:03:50.047]  So, Obama calls himself a citizen of the world.
[02:03:50.047 --> 02:03:55.110]  He uses the term redistributing the wealth as much as Karl Marx ever did.
[02:03:55.110 --> 02:04:03.735]  He's talking about redistributing your wealth to people who do not work, people who are too lazy to work, to illegal aliens who
[02:04:05.194 --> 02:04:10.358]  A family of four, on average, needs more than $4,000 a year.
[02:04:10.358 --> 02:04:12.979]  But again, Jim, that's only a small portion.
[02:04:12.979 --> 02:04:15.721]  Most of the trillions are going to the banks.
[02:04:15.721 --> 02:04:21.204]  They just give a few crumbs to their minions.
[02:04:21.204 --> 02:04:30.810]  Yes, that's what they, like you said, they want the people to be so in such desperate financial straits they'll accept anything relief.
[02:04:30.810 --> 02:04:32.471]  Like some years ago when they talked about
[02:04:35.595 --> 02:04:41.501]  Tell you what Jim, Jim, I've got callers coming up 1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:41.501 --> 02:04:43.983]  The book is Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary.
[02:04:43.983 --> 02:04:45.545]  We sell it at Infowars.com.
[02:04:45.545 --> 02:04:47.907]  But Jim, stay there for one more moment.
[02:04:47.907 --> 02:04:49.949]  You've got three minutes to go smoke a cigarette.
[02:04:49.949 --> 02:04:51.891]  Come back and we'll do five more minutes and I'll let you go.
[02:04:51.891 --> 02:04:54.174]  Okay, go ahead and go have your cigarette.
[02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:09.335]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:11.617]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[02:05:11.617 --> 02:05:13.758]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[02:05:13.758 --> 02:05:17.741]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[02:05:17.741 --> 02:05:21.745]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[02:05:21.745 --> 02:05:28.470]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[02:05:32.003 --> 02:05:34.624]  Great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[02:05:34.624 --> 02:05:43.267]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival spy and tactical gear.

[02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:04.606]  In the New World Order's war against humanity.
[02:06:05.245 --> 02:06:08.086]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:08.086 --> 02:06:13.948]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.948 --> 02:06:20.490]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:22.431]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.431 --> 02:06:24.892]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:24.892 --> 02:06:34.615]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[02:06:35.095 --> 02:06:38.056]  That's fascism.
[02:06:38.056 --> 02:06:39.737]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.737 --> 02:06:41.597]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.597 --> 02:06:48.499]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:08:02.747 --> 02:08:09.390]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.390 --> 02:08:12.351]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.431 --> 02:08:31.622]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting for the next hour and 51 minutes of this syndicated radio transmission.
[02:08:31.622 --> 02:08:39.435]  I'll be taking your calls, Matt, Chip, Joshua, Annie, Dan, and many others that are patiently holding as soon as Jim leaves us coming up here.
[02:08:41.201 --> 02:08:42.202]  in just a few minutes.
[02:08:42.202 --> 02:08:48.786]  You know, I've already done two hours and eight minutes of radio today and haven't plugged yet the Obama deception.
[02:08:48.786 --> 02:08:51.368]  My new film, viral all over the web.
[02:08:51.368 --> 02:08:54.490]  People are buying the high-quality DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:08:54.490 --> 02:08:55.971]  They're making copies of it.
[02:08:55.971 --> 02:08:58.072]  They're giving it to their friends, their family, their neighbors.
[02:08:58.072 --> 02:08:59.473]  They're airing it on AXS TV.
[02:08:59.473 --> 02:09:03.656]  They're having viewing parties.
[02:09:03.656 --> 02:09:05.177]  I just want to salute
[02:09:06.283 --> 02:09:20.405]  And thank everyone that has gotten the Obama deception, and I want to encourage those of you that haven't to please get it at InfoWars.com, the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart, and make all the copies your heart wants to.
[02:09:21.715 --> 02:09:23.837]  I mean, as many as you can make.
[02:09:23.837 --> 02:09:31.944]  I know a lot of universities and other groups of students are going out and everywhere Obama goes to speak, they're giving out thousands of these.
[02:09:31.944 --> 02:09:45.157]  And the tea parties that the neocons are trying to co-opt, patriots, true patriots, are going out to these events and really waking up the people that are the tea parties to the full scope of the New World Order.
[02:09:45.157 --> 02:09:46.418]  So again, InfoWars.com.
[02:09:47.739 --> 02:09:50.142]  Or call toll-free to order the Obama Deception 888-253-3139.
[02:09:50.142 --> 02:09:50.202]  888-253-3139.
[02:09:50.202 --> 02:09:54.986]  And by the way, if you want to meet like-minded people, the best way to do it is through t-shirts.
[02:10:07.208 --> 02:10:10.289]  And we've got the answer in 1984, 1776 shirts.
[02:10:10.289 --> 02:10:11.689]  People say, what does that mean?
[02:10:11.689 --> 02:10:12.329]  You can explain.
[02:10:12.329 --> 02:10:13.990]  We want liberty instead of tyranny.
[02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:17.511]  The choice is 1776 culture or 1984 culture.
[02:10:17.511 --> 02:10:18.171]  Which one do you want?
[02:10:18.171 --> 02:10:23.692]  Now, we've got all these other t-shirts that are about getting people talking, meeting like-minded people.
[02:10:23.692 --> 02:10:25.773]  Just wear an InfoWars.com around, folks.
[02:10:25.773 --> 02:10:27.393]  And all the shirts have that on the back.
[02:10:27.393 --> 02:10:29.634]  You're gonna run into a lot of InfoWarriors.
[02:10:31.274 --> 02:10:34.497]  You want to find like-minded people, this is the way to do it.
[02:10:34.497 --> 02:10:35.318]  Big time.
[02:10:35.318 --> 02:10:38.301]  Because there are Infowarriors in every town, every city.
[02:10:38.301 --> 02:10:38.981]  It's really getting huge.
[02:10:38.981 --> 02:10:45.868]  We have this new Live Free or Die t-shirt that's got Paul Revere charging out with a musket in his hand.
[02:10:45.868 --> 02:10:48.130]  Just a gorgeous shirt, great designer.
[02:10:48.130 --> 02:10:49.251]  Put that together.
[02:10:49.251 --> 02:10:52.595]  All available at Infowars.com.
[02:10:52.595 --> 02:10:54.176]  Okay, that said, I'm going to go back to Jim in a moment.
[02:10:54.176 --> 02:10:55.618]  I want to tell you about one of our
[02:10:57.162 --> 02:11:23.532]  uh... sponsors and this is a new sponsor because i've used this project of this uh... i believe in nano silver the smaller the particle the better and uh... silver's one of the oldest antibiotics there's a lot of great silver products out there uh... but i've tested uh... this one out with sore throats uh... with other things like that you know what fifteen percent of kids have that thing where they get a few warts on them uh... my son had that
[02:11:24.511 --> 02:11:24.771]  I think?
[02:11:41.110 --> 02:11:42.491]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:11:42.491 --> 02:11:44.352]  Prepare you and your family.
[02:11:44.352 --> 02:11:48.235]  The new silver solution is a new type of solution that is a nanoparticle.
[02:11:48.235 --> 02:11:50.416]  It is absorbed by the body more quickly and effectively.
[02:11:50.416 --> 02:11:53.738]  Visit the link on InfoWars.com and see the studies for yourself.
[02:11:53.738 --> 02:11:55.860]  You cannot afford to miss this opportunity.
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:58.021]  This is a great way to protect your family and friends.
[02:11:58.021 --> 02:12:00.883]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:12:00.883 --> 02:12:03.705]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:12:03.705 --> 02:12:06.226]  You cannot put a price tag on your family's health.
[02:12:06.226 --> 02:12:08.007]  Go and watch the testimonials and you'll see
[02:12:09.977 --> 02:12:11.217]  What they have to say.
[02:12:11.217 --> 02:12:13.138]  Okay, going back to Jim Tucker.
[02:12:13.138 --> 02:12:15.299]  I'm going to let him go in a moment because I know he's busy.
[02:12:15.299 --> 02:12:16.679]  Jim, I wanted to finish up.
[02:12:16.679 --> 02:12:19.620]  We've got Bilderberg 2009 coming up.
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:20.761]  Now, just keep going back to this.
[02:12:20.761 --> 02:12:21.741]  It's such a big deal.
[02:12:21.741 --> 02:12:23.221]  You have sources inside Bilderberg.
[02:12:23.221 --> 02:12:24.562]  We'll just leave it at that.
[02:12:24.562 --> 02:12:27.383]  Esalen admits he has Bilderberg group members.
[02:12:28.257 --> 02:12:28.517]  No, because
[02:12:51.565 --> 02:13:03.931]  As we mentioned earlier, public awareness is increasing, even if politicians dare not use the word Bilderberg, they're forced, as your governor was, to acknowledge that there is a problem, and we must face it.
[02:13:03.931 --> 02:13:15.716]  We have seen so many examples of it being reported, the term Bilderberg not used in the national media.
[02:13:15.716 --> 02:13:19.518]  You've cited some broadcast statements, the awareness is growing.
[02:13:20.166 --> 02:13:21.607]  And politicians are scared.
[02:13:21.607 --> 02:13:26.830]  They're even talking about what Bilderberg denounces as protectionism.
[02:13:26.830 --> 02:13:30.712]  Nationalism, as Bilderberg acknowledges, is on the increase.
[02:13:30.712 --> 02:13:34.054]  And a nationalist is a horrible thing, the Bilderberg view.
[02:13:34.054 --> 02:13:40.858]  So, and as I mentioned earlier, they're far behind their own timetable for a world government.
[02:13:40.858 --> 02:13:45.381]  So I think they're ultimately going to fail.
[02:13:45.381 --> 02:13:46.762]  But the trouble is,
[02:13:48.404 --> 02:13:53.627]  The Americans are not fighting back hard enough like the Europeans are fighting back.
[02:13:53.627 --> 02:14:01.151]  Europe, England still refuses to join the European Union's common currency.
[02:14:01.151 --> 02:14:03.373]  They still keep the pound.
[02:14:03.373 --> 02:14:06.875]  They refuse to surrender further sovereignty to the European Union.
[02:14:10.453 --> 02:14:21.662]  Demands throughout the European Union member states are less powered by the European Union and more sovereignty all the time.
[02:14:21.662 --> 02:14:30.869]  The United States, we're not fighting back as hard and that's why certain bad things could still happen even if Bilderberg is on the ropes.
[02:14:30.869 --> 02:14:35.053]  For example, if we join the World Court
[02:14:35.939 --> 02:14:40.183]  If Obama wants to, we've surrendered a great deal of sovereignty.
[02:14:40.183 --> 02:14:42.265]  We'll never get back.
[02:14:42.265 --> 02:14:53.155]  The International Criminal Court and the World Court are both, would both be similar, superior, superior to our own United States Supreme Court.
[02:14:53.155 --> 02:15:00.502]  And tragically, recently the party justice Sandra Day O'Connor is among those who advocate
[02:15:02.293 --> 02:15:05.154]  Surrendering sovereignty to the International Criminal Court.
[02:15:05.154 --> 02:15:27.160]  They are, sadly, the son of the District Director of the Supreme Court Justice and President of the United States, William Howard Taft, and his son, late Robert Taft, the great American First Senator from Ohio.
[02:15:28.929 --> 02:15:37.072]  The latest Robert Taft divorce is all for surrendering our sovereignty to the International Criminal Court.
[02:15:37.072 --> 02:15:44.815]  They just had a press conference in Washington demanding that we join the International Criminal Court just a few days ago.
[02:15:45.735 --> 02:15:54.817]  And that means, for those that don't know, fully adopting the European system of guilty until proven innocent, getting rid of juries, having tribunals.
[02:15:54.817 --> 02:16:06.741]  And we've had Supreme Court justices in Time Magazine, in USA Today, come right out and say, oh, we take our orders now from the higher court, from the International Criminal Court.
[02:16:06.741 --> 02:16:08.161]  So this process is happening.
[02:16:09.119 --> 02:16:26.530]  Yes, we'll sit around the Supreme Court Chambers and talk openly about how we certainly should look to the decisions made by foreign courts in applying constitutional law to the United States.
[02:16:26.530 --> 02:16:27.991]  That's absurd on its face.
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:42.654]  And one of the strongest patriots of the Supreme Court is Clarence Thomas, who, although he is himself a nigger, is hated by liberals for opposing affirmative action.
[02:16:42.654 --> 02:16:46.038]  There's even some for racial discrimination.
[02:16:50.841 --> 02:16:54.143]  Well, Jim Tucker, we appreciate you coming on the show.
[02:16:54.143 --> 02:17:00.567]  We appreciate your close to 50-something years covering news in 30-plus years.
[02:17:00.567 --> 02:17:01.867]  What is it, 32, 33, 34 years?
[02:17:01.867 --> 02:17:03.828]  How long have you been covering Bilderberg?
[02:17:13.109 --> 02:17:20.813]  All right, well, I really appreciate you coming on and I hope you'll join us from... You're going to be going to Greece, right, to cover Bilderberg?
[02:17:20.813 --> 02:17:22.414]  Yeah.
[02:17:22.414 --> 02:17:24.715]  The itinerary is on our website.
[02:17:24.715 --> 02:17:26.236]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:17:26.236 --> 02:17:33.600]  And folks, again, can get your book at infowars.com and the shopping cart, Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, put out by American Free Press.
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:35.781]  Jim, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:17:35.781 --> 02:17:41.464]  And when do I need to have my producer check your itinerary to set a couple of updates from you while you're at Bilderberg 2009?
[02:17:43.118 --> 02:17:45.379]  Oh, uh, whenever he wants to.
[02:17:45.379 --> 02:17:48.360]  Remembering that there's the seven hour time difference calls.
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:56.604]  When we're on daylight time, it's the... Yeah, so we'll be interviewing you then, uh, every, uh, evening at, say, seven o'clock.
[02:17:56.604 --> 02:17:58.324]  Uh, we can pick out some time.
[02:17:58.324 --> 02:18:07.228]  Uh, no, it'd be better to do it in the middle of the afternoon because we normally have our, as you recall from your own experience, we have our pool meeting, uh, in the evenings.
[02:18:07.228 --> 02:18:09.229]  No, I know, but see, we're live eleven...
[02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:12.431]  We're live 11 to 3 p.m.
[02:18:12.431 --> 02:18:25.074]  So I guess it was a seven hour difference in the Mediterranean in that zone in Greece that I could have you on at like 11 and then that would be at 6 o'clock.
[02:18:25.074 --> 02:18:26.355]  That's how we've had to do it in the past.
[02:18:26.355 --> 02:18:28.155]  I guess I could record the interviews, Jim.
[02:18:28.155 --> 02:18:29.656]  Or how about 2 p.m.
[02:18:29.656 --> 02:18:30.136]  Greek time?
[02:18:30.136 --> 02:18:33.537]  That would still be within your nighttime frame, wouldn't it?
[02:18:34.491 --> 02:18:37.553]  Yeah, I do have a nighttime show, but Jason Berners is doing that now.
[02:18:37.553 --> 02:18:39.975]  Well, we'll figure it out, Jim, regardless.
[02:18:39.975 --> 02:18:42.677]  Regardless, regardless.
[02:18:42.677 --> 02:18:49.641]  I know you have your pool reports going on there, but it's always breaking news on what's coming up in the next year, because these people really do run the planet.
[02:18:49.641 --> 02:18:51.343]  Jim Tucker, thank you so much.
[02:18:51.343 --> 02:18:52.003]  You're welcome.
[02:18:52.003 --> 02:18:55.365]  All right, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:18:55.365 --> 02:19:01.710]  You know, one of my pet peeves is people not knowing what words mean in semantics, because I know I'm going to get emails from ignorant people.
[02:19:03.052 --> 02:19:07.837]  Remember Robin Page, who we had on BBC Reporter, was in the BBC News.
[02:19:07.837 --> 02:19:09.478]  He did a report on rural affairs.
[02:19:09.478 --> 02:19:14.543]  He gave a speech saying, rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.
[02:19:14.543 --> 02:19:20.989]  He was arrested when the British police, five years ago, said, the word homosexual is a hate word.
[02:19:20.989 --> 02:19:25.914]  Now, heterosexual, homosexual, that's just a scientific name for your sexual preference.
[02:19:27.008 --> 02:19:43.292]  That's the same thing with Anglo Negro and I was watching a documentary about the fifties and sixties civil rights movement and it showed the black folks saying we demand to be called that and then nowadays the public's so ignorant somebody uses the old-fashioned term and then they all freak out.
[02:19:43.292 --> 02:19:45.413]  See that shows how screwed up the public is.
[02:19:45.413 --> 02:19:49.534]  They don't care if the government funds HIV and black folks vaccines.
[02:19:49.534 --> 02:19:51.495]  It's just don't use a scientific term.
[02:19:51.495 --> 02:19:53.255]  I just wanted to add that before I get emails.
[02:19:53.255 --> 02:19:55.116]  You need to learn not to be so ignorant out there.
[02:19:55.116 --> 02:19:55.916]  We'll be right back folks.
[02:19:55.916 --> 02:19:56.296]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.631 --> 02:20:08.155]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[02:20:08.155 --> 02:20:11.176]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[02:20:11.176 --> 02:20:16.640]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[02:20:17.376 --> 02:20:21.037]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[02:20:21.037 --> 02:20:22.317]  We have been warned.
[02:20:22.317 --> 02:20:28.599]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[02:20:28.599 --> 02:20:29.319]  Too late.
[02:20:29.319 --> 02:20:32.520]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:32.960]  Why?
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:36.962]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[02:20:36.962 --> 02:20:38.262]  Supplies are running low.
[02:20:38.522 --> 02:20:45.008]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.
[02:20:45.008 --> 02:20:48.931]  Order right now and receive free shipping on all one-year supplies.
[02:20:48.931 --> 02:20:51.393]  Go to YourFoodStorage.com.
[02:20:51.393 --> 02:20:53.174]  That's YourFoodStorage.com.
[02:20:53.174 --> 02:20:53.575]  Or call 877-482-FOOD.
[02:20:53.575 --> 02:20:54.235]  That's 877-482-FOOD today!
[02:21:02.091 --> 02:21:07.897]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.897 --> 02:21:15.465]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:15.465 --> 02:21:21.652]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:22.052 --> 02:21:24.014]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:24.014 --> 02:21:26.536]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:26.536 --> 02:21:38.104]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:38.104 --> 02:21:39.786]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.786 --> 02:21:41.647]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:41.647 --> 02:21:47.872]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.542 --> 02:21:56.809]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.809 --> 02:21:58.391]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.391 --> 02:21:59.592]  The people strike back!
[02:22:01.499 --> 02:22:02.540]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:07.504]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:22:07.504 --> 02:22:15.572]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:22:15.572 --> 02:22:21.157]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:22:21.157 --> 02:22:28.123]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:22:28.363 --> 02:22:28.904]  We're good to go!
[02:22:50.166 --> 02:22:53.592]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:22:53.592 --> 02:22:54.754]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:54.754 --> 02:22:54.955]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:03.251 --> 02:23:03.871]  We're good to go.
[02:23:32.836 --> 02:23:36.677]  This is the system that credit card companies don't want you to know about.
[02:23:36.677 --> 02:23:41.218]  This is a fast, proven, and legal process for your credit card debt concerns.
[02:23:41.218 --> 02:23:42.938]  Call the bailout group now at 800-324-6554.
[02:23:42.938 --> 02:23:43.158]  That's 800-324-6554.
[02:23:43.158 --> 02:23:44.698]  Debt relief experts are standing by.
[02:23:44.698 --> 02:23:46.558]  You have nothing to lose, except your credit card debt.
[02:23:46.558 --> 02:23:46.779]  Call 800-324-6554.
[02:23:46.779 --> 02:23:47.039]  800-324-6554 today!
[02:24:16.593 --> 02:24:31.136]  Okay, so, the state of Texas is on the verge of passing a 10th Amendment slash 9th Amendment reaffirmation of the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[02:24:31.136 --> 02:24:32.996]  South Dakota's passed it.
[02:24:32.996 --> 02:24:35.717]  A bunch of other states are in the process of passing it.
[02:24:35.717 --> 02:24:39.738]  And see, all of you out there said, oh, it won't do any good, oh, it won't help.
[02:24:39.738 --> 02:24:41.298]  You won't get this passed, Jones.
[02:24:42.495 --> 02:24:45.638]  And then, oh, well, even if it passes, they won't enforce it.
[02:24:45.638 --> 02:24:50.583]  It's all part of a process, a reawakening to our liberties and freedoms.
[02:24:50.583 --> 02:24:53.245]  It's just one more solution.
[02:24:53.245 --> 02:25:03.355]  And also, when the Feds put out these reports saying gun owners are terrorists, veterans are terrorists, people that love freedom are bad, well, we just rebuke how bad this is and expose what a fraud it is.
[02:25:05.353 --> 02:25:09.195]  I mean, we gotta be in the fight, not just sit here and say it's too big, we don't have any power.
[02:25:09.195 --> 02:25:11.136]  The truth is, we do have a lot of power.
[02:25:11.136 --> 02:25:23.423]  To the point of Bilderberg Group, New World Order crony, busy handing over the roads and power plants to the Bilderberg Group, that's on record, Rick Perry has to come out and camouflage himself like he's one of us.
[02:25:23.423 --> 02:25:26.965]  And, you know, if he's forced by political weight, because he's checked the vote.
[02:25:26.965 --> 02:25:29.967]  Remember a month and a half ago when I had state senators on and people?
[02:25:31.818 --> 02:25:32.418]  And more importantly,
[02:25:57.452 --> 02:26:02.422]  Millions of Texans just like yourself that are tired of Washington D.C.
[02:26:02.422 --> 02:26:05.949]  trying to come down here and tell us how to run Texas.
[02:26:17.179 --> 02:26:19.841]  I happen to think this is a pretty bold step.
[02:26:19.841 --> 02:26:30.848]  HCR is, as introduced by Representative Creighton, co-authored by Representative Guillén, is a bipartisan piece of legislation.
[02:26:30.848 --> 02:26:33.190]  It concerns all Texans.
[02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:35.532]  It concerns all Americans.
[02:26:35.532 --> 02:26:41.756]  The Tenth Amendment was enacted by folks who remembered what it was like to have
[02:26:42.990 --> 02:26:50.311]  A very oppressive government to be under the thumb of tyrants and an all-powerful government.
[02:26:50.311 --> 02:26:52.812]  Unfortunately, the protection... Hit pause.
[02:26:52.812 --> 02:26:54.972]  I mean, that is too incredible.
[02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:58.373]  And we know what it's like to be under the thumb of tyrants.
[02:26:58.373 --> 02:26:59.753]  Man, I've met Rick Perry.
[02:26:59.753 --> 02:27:00.493]  I know Rick Perry.
[02:27:00.493 --> 02:27:03.594]  He does not normally talk with that big of a Texas accent.
[02:27:03.594 --> 02:27:06.034]  I mean, this is deep.
[02:27:06.034 --> 02:27:08.715]  I would call that a far-west Texas accent, almost.
[02:27:09.474 --> 02:27:14.595]  And he from South Texas Point is, I'm the thumb of tyrants!
[02:27:14.595 --> 02:27:16.235]  Tyrants!
[02:27:16.235 --> 02:27:16.815]  Back it up!
[02:27:16.815 --> 02:27:18.456]  He can't even hardly understand.
[02:27:18.456 --> 02:27:21.056]  Tyrants!
[02:27:21.056 --> 02:27:24.757]  I'm the oppressive thumb of tyrants!
[02:27:24.757 --> 02:27:25.977]  I like that though.
[02:27:25.977 --> 02:27:29.558]  At least they're talking about the oppressive thumb of tyrants now.
[02:27:29.558 --> 02:27:31.738]  Because again, we are becoming the mainstream.
[02:27:31.738 --> 02:27:34.198]  The government is tyrannical.
[02:27:34.198 --> 02:27:35.279]  Here it is.
[02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:36.839]  The 10th Amendment was enacted
[02:27:37.884 --> 02:27:49.928]  By folks who remembered what it was like to have a very oppressive government, to be under the thumb of tyrants and an all-powerful government.
[02:27:49.928 --> 02:27:58.151]  Unfortunately, the protections it guarantees have melted away over the course of the years.
[02:27:58.151 --> 02:28:02.293]  You're probably familiar with that old adage about
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:04.600]  How to boil a frog.
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:15.124]  You know, you just get him to sit there in that pot, and you turn up the heat a little bit by a little bit, and before you know it, the frog doesn't realize it, but he's done.
[02:28:15.124 --> 02:28:20.065]  And, uh, since the United States Constitution was ratified... Stop it!
[02:28:20.065 --> 02:28:21.505]  I've got to imitate this.
[02:28:21.505 --> 02:28:23.686]  How many times have I done the frog in the pot thing?
[02:28:23.686 --> 02:28:26.247]  I mean, it's like Alex Jones is now the governor.
[02:28:30.472 --> 02:28:30.912]  I don't know.
[02:28:48.493 --> 02:28:52.116]  They're trying to chameleon now and act like they're patriots because they're getting the feedback.
[02:28:52.116 --> 02:28:52.917]  They're learning.
[02:28:52.917 --> 02:28:54.579]  They know about the New World Order now.
[02:28:54.579 --> 02:28:55.439]  They know about everything.
[02:28:55.439 --> 02:28:57.021]  They know about everything we stole.
[02:28:57.021 --> 02:29:03.207]  They know I took money from Merck knowing that vaccine killed people so we would get vaccine damage federal funding.
[02:29:03.207 --> 02:29:09.753]  Because if I make it mandatory, or say it's mandatory, then the federal funds kick in to give it liability protection.
[02:29:10.293 --> 02:29:11.756]  They're finding out about me.
[02:29:11.756 --> 02:29:16.707]  They're finding out I won't fight the Tyrants too.
[02:29:16.707 --> 02:29:19.172]  I'm against them as well.
[02:29:19.172 --> 02:29:19.894]  Here, play it again.
[02:29:19.894 --> 02:29:20.475]  Play it again.
[02:29:23.939 --> 02:29:33.046]  You know, you just get him to sit there in that pot, and you turn up the heat a little bit by a little bit, and before you know it, the frog doesn't realize it, but he's done.
[02:29:33.046 --> 02:29:38.590]  And since the United States Constitution was ratified, the federal government's been slowing down.
[02:29:51.946 --> 02:29:53.327]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.327 --> 02:29:55.869]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.869 --> 02:30:01.953]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.953 --> 02:30:08.798]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have?
[02:30:08.798 --> 02:30:09.759]  It's true.
[02:30:09.759 --> 02:30:15.343]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:15.343 --> 02:30:16.804]  Not if, but when.
[02:30:16.804 --> 02:30:17.525]  Hi Bill.
[02:30:19.209 --> 02:30:19.569]  Let's do it!
[02:30:34.674 --> 02:30:42.138]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear out or break, and requires no gas.
[02:30:42.138 --> 02:30:46.121]  Don't wait for the Energy Czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[02:30:46.121 --> 02:30:48.562]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[02:30:48.562 --> 02:30:50.823]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[02:30:50.823 --> 02:30:53.405]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:30:53.405 --> 02:30:53.905]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:30:53.905 --> 02:30:53.945]  877-327-0365.
[02:31:02.122 --> 02:31:07.361]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:08.152 --> 02:31:14.015]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:14.015 --> 02:31:20.537]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.537 --> 02:31:22.498]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.498 --> 02:31:24.959]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:24.959 --> 02:31:35.844]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:38.152 --> 02:31:39.812]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.812 --> 02:31:41.673]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.673 --> 02:31:48.574]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:56.836 --> 02:31:58.417]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.417 --> 02:31:59.597]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.164 --> 02:32:02.866]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:32:02.866 --> 02:32:04.609]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:32:04.609 --> 02:32:07.292]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:32:07.292 --> 02:32:12.439]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:32:12.439 --> 02:32:15.623]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:32:15.623 --> 02:32:19.087]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[02:32:19.528 --> 02:32:32.071]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[02:32:32.071 --> 02:32:34.072]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[02:32:34.072 --> 02:32:35.792]  I use one every day.
[02:32:35.792 --> 02:32:38.253]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:32:38.513 --> 02:32:39.213]  We're good to go.
[02:33:11.298 --> 02:33:16.783]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[02:33:16.783 --> 02:33:21.348]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[02:33:21.348 --> 02:33:22.609]  And we had Rick Perry with us.
[02:33:22.609 --> 02:33:24.931]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'.
[02:33:24.931 --> 02:33:27.614]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:33:27.614 --> 02:33:30.496]  We fired once more and they began to run it.
[02:33:30.496 --> 02:33:31.878]  Down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:33:31.878 --> 02:33:33.960]  And then what happened is Rick Perry was with the Redcoats.
[02:33:36.187 --> 02:33:40.310]  And he ran behind a bush, took his red coat off and put one of our uniforms on.
[02:33:40.310 --> 02:33:40.830]  He ran out.
[02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:42.572]  Hey, I'm with you guys.
[02:33:42.572 --> 02:33:44.273]  We need to fight the tyrants.
[02:33:44.273 --> 02:33:49.998]  We don't want to be like that frog pretty soon cooking in that pot, boy.
[02:33:49.998 --> 02:33:53.380]  It's all a big act with Perry.
[02:33:53.380 --> 02:33:55.102]  The whole Texas thing is like with Buzz.
[02:33:55.102 --> 02:33:58.865]  And it really gets old.
[02:33:58.865 --> 02:34:00.126]  We look down the river.
[02:34:03.581 --> 02:34:04.301]  I gotta watch it.
[02:34:04.301 --> 02:34:06.683]  If I go into Hickland, I'm actually somewhat of a hick.
[02:34:06.683 --> 02:34:09.064]  I'll actually revert.
[02:34:09.064 --> 02:34:14.408]  Start talking like, uh, Granny Clampett.
[02:34:14.408 --> 02:34:17.950]  You get you in there and get me some pastas.
[02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:21.052]  Get the frying pan out there, Jeffro.
[02:34:21.052 --> 02:34:24.033]  Gee, Granny, I guess so.
[02:34:24.033 --> 02:34:26.255]  I guess Rick Perry's on our side then.
[02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:39.332]  Oh, man, I am really out of control today.
[02:34:39.332 --> 02:34:43.214]  Well, everything is going to hell in a handbasket, so I might as well have some fun with it.
[02:34:43.214 --> 02:34:45.655]  Let's be serious, and I'm going to your calls.
[02:34:45.655 --> 02:34:51.597]  Back it up, and let's just hear what Rick Perry had to say, unedited, without me stopping and laughing.
[02:34:52.481 --> 02:34:54.682]  Okay, but I mean, here he is playing his good ol' boy.
[02:34:54.682 --> 02:35:05.167]  I mean, I'm surprised he wasn't wearing a cowboy hat and a big belt buckle, going... But the point is, is that that's fake, and all the rest of it's fake.
[02:35:05.167 --> 02:35:10.329]  But the reason this is important is this globalist involved in everything horrid for the New World Order.
[02:35:10.329 --> 02:35:11.930]  I mean, he's been to Bilderberg.
[02:35:11.930 --> 02:35:14.731]  Normally, if a governor's invited to that, it means they're planning to make him president later.
[02:35:15.925 --> 02:35:18.907]  He's doing this now because he knows which way the wind is blowing.
[02:35:18.907 --> 02:35:20.929]  This will be a betrayal, make no mistake.
[02:35:20.929 --> 02:35:25.812]  But it means still that we're forcing them to at least talk the talk.
[02:35:25.812 --> 02:35:28.094]  That means we can make a lot of them walk the walk.
[02:35:28.094 --> 02:35:33.037]  So let's go ahead and go to Rick Perry, the incredible good old boy.
[02:35:33.037 --> 02:35:34.618]  Here he is.
[02:35:34.618 --> 02:35:39.502]  Representative Guillen is a bipartisan piece of legislation.
[02:35:39.502 --> 02:35:41.844]  It concerns all Texans.
[02:35:41.844 --> 02:35:43.405]  It concerns all Americans.
[02:35:44.258 --> 02:35:58.965]  The Tenth Amendment was enacted by folks who remembered what it was like to have a very oppressive government, to be under the thumb of tyrants and an all-powerful government.
[02:35:58.965 --> 02:36:07.190]  Unfortunately, the protections it guarantees have melted away over the course of the years.
[02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:11.312]  You're probably familiar with that old adage about
[02:36:12.270 --> 02:36:13.631]  How to boil a frog.
[02:36:13.631 --> 02:36:24.136]  You know, you just get him to sit there in that pot, and you turn up the heat a little bit by a little bit, and before you know it, the frog doesn't realize it, but he's done.
[02:36:24.136 --> 02:36:41.244]  And since the United States Constitution was ratified, the federal government's been slowly kind of turning up the heat on the states, if you will, and they've eroded the notion of states' rights.
[02:36:42.654 --> 02:36:56.119]  The Founding Fathers understood that a one-size-approach doesn't work with the states when it comes to governing.
[02:36:56.119 --> 02:37:00.741]  Especially a country the size of the United States.
[02:37:00.741 --> 02:37:03.042]  And I'll promise you it doesn't work for Texas.
[02:37:04.193 --> 02:37:18.142]  Our economic strength compared to the federal budget mess and other problems that they've got up there is a great example that Texans know best how to govern Texas.
[02:37:19.127 --> 02:37:30.854]  We're proof that good things happen when government lowers taxes, it lowers regulations, it reduces spending, it encourages private sector growth.
[02:37:44.076 --> 02:37:46.621]  They passed all these other little taxes.
[02:37:46.621 --> 02:37:52.212]  It's gotta be every month some new tax bureaucrat shows up informing me of a new tax.
[02:37:52.212 --> 02:37:53.635]  Here at our little office.
[02:37:56.587 --> 02:37:58.529]  The state of Texas is under federal control.
[02:37:58.529 --> 02:38:01.111]  The state police are brainwashed by the feds.
[02:38:01.111 --> 02:38:04.153]  They're doing all sorts of urban warfare drills.
[02:38:04.153 --> 02:38:06.355]  Texas is going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:38:06.355 --> 02:38:12.179]  Rick Perry's handing over the state-paid-for power plants, roads, infrastructure to the Bilderberg Group.
[02:38:12.179 --> 02:38:17.844]  He's tied in with people from Bilderberg that have been indicted in foreign banks running scams in Texas.
[02:38:17.844 --> 02:38:22.828]  And then he's going to prance around telling us about tyrants.
[02:38:29.432 --> 02:38:35.838]  On record one time, we had a reporter down at the Capitol and Rick Perry walks out and they go, hey Governor Perry, it's Alex Jones here on the phone.
[02:38:35.838 --> 02:38:39.221]  And he goes, what are you doing, you big ol' fat hog?
[02:38:39.221 --> 02:38:40.102]  People think I'm joking.
[02:38:40.102 --> 02:38:44.506]  John, did you find that when I mentioned it?
[02:38:44.506 --> 02:38:47.229]  You can YouTube Alex Jones, Rick Perry.
[02:38:47.229 --> 02:38:48.089]  You can find it.
[02:38:48.089 --> 02:38:48.930]  It doesn't matter.
[02:38:48.930 --> 02:38:51.012]  People can hear it if they want.
[02:38:51.012 --> 02:38:52.854]  Point is, Rick Perry is a real piece of work.
[02:38:57.352 --> 02:38:59.714]  Look, if this is good news that he's at least having a talk about it.
[02:38:59.714 --> 02:39:00.555]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[02:39:00.555 --> 02:39:03.057]  I'm going to shut up and try to just bam, bam, bam, go through them here.
[02:39:03.057 --> 02:39:05.138]  Of course, you know I'll fail, but that's alright.
[02:39:05.138 --> 02:39:06.419]  Uh, Matt in Mass.
[02:39:06.419 --> 02:39:07.200]  You're on the air, Matt.
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:08.341]  Go ahead.
[02:39:08.341 --> 02:39:09.182]  Hello, Alex.
[02:39:09.182 --> 02:39:12.864]  I'd like you to know it's an honor and a privilege to finally talk to you.
[02:39:12.864 --> 02:39:14.546]  It's an honor and privilege to talk to you, sir.
[02:39:14.546 --> 02:39:15.126]  Welcome.
[02:39:15.126 --> 02:39:19.590]  I am one pissed off American, but according to the government, I'm just a crazy terrorist.
[02:39:20.643 --> 02:39:21.244]  Absolutely.
[02:39:21.244 --> 02:39:23.866]  You don't like foreign banks ruling you and stealing all your money?
[02:39:23.866 --> 02:39:25.307]  That is crazy.
[02:39:25.307 --> 02:39:26.108]  You're dangerous.
[02:39:26.108 --> 02:39:27.970]  I tell you, whoa, what am I going to do?
[02:39:27.970 --> 02:39:29.151]  I got so much to talk about.
[02:39:29.151 --> 02:39:33.254]  You don't know what I've been through, especially with the bank foreclosing on me.
[02:39:33.254 --> 02:39:38.499]  But anyways, you know, up in Massachusetts, 90% of the people up here are still asleep.
[02:39:38.499 --> 02:39:40.681]  They have no idea what's going on.
[02:39:40.681 --> 02:39:45.525]  And I'm excited to go to Lexington on the Green on the 19th to see what kind of turnout we got.
[02:39:46.718 --> 02:39:55.661]  Absolutely, and I'm going to have the folks doing that, the Oath Keepers, all these police and military going there to say, we won't confiscate guns, we won't go along with stealing property, New World Order.
[02:39:55.661 --> 02:40:04.345]  And if we educate the police and military, which is now happening, that's right, globalists are trying to brainwash them with all these reports saying gun owners are evil and all the rest of it.
[02:40:04.345 --> 02:40:08.626]  If we reach out to the uniforms, the New World Order won't be able to get away with anything.
[02:40:08.626 --> 02:40:12.488]  Exactly, unless they set the Chinese and the Russians on us.
[02:40:13.829 --> 02:40:27.219]  Which they've openly done deals to actually use Czech Republic, Ukrainians, Filipinos, Mexicans, Canadians on us, and some Germans and Dutch, because I've been to the drills and seen the agreements.
[02:40:27.219 --> 02:40:31.223]  But if you want to talk about Chinese and Russians, I know because it's in Red Dawn,
[02:40:31.863 --> 02:40:35.406]  And that's kind of popular on the militia movement to think that.
[02:40:35.406 --> 02:40:40.390]  But we know the countries they're training with to occupy the U.S., so that's admitted in Army War College documents.
[02:40:40.390 --> 02:40:42.231]  We've got Colonel Craig Roberts on to talk about it.
[02:40:42.231 --> 02:40:47.595]  They give chapter and verse that they will use foreign troops in America, but they list those nations.
[02:40:47.595 --> 02:40:51.418]  But it is very, very serious.
[02:40:51.418 --> 02:40:53.079]  Yeah.
[02:40:53.079 --> 02:40:53.580]  Sure.
[02:40:53.580 --> 02:40:54.701]  And you know what?
[02:40:54.701 --> 02:40:59.544]  If I had your resources, I'd be as loud or louder.
[02:40:59.544 --> 02:40:59.985]  But, you know.
[02:41:00.745 --> 02:41:02.806]  What else is on your mind, Matt?
[02:41:02.806 --> 02:41:10.229]  Listen, first I'd like to say, you know, I would be more than happy to move to Texas and work for you for nothing.
[02:41:10.229 --> 02:41:12.770]  I mean, that's how much faith I have in you.
[02:41:12.770 --> 02:41:15.871]  I am calling about eugenics.
[02:41:15.871 --> 02:41:25.115]  I have hepatitis C. I don't know anybody who has AIDS, and I'm 50 years old, but I know at least 30 people who have hepatitis C.
[02:41:25.996 --> 02:41:28.077]  I don't know where I contracted it from.
[02:41:28.077 --> 02:41:33.361]  I have tattoos, but I've been to licensed parlors that have been inspected and whatnot.
[02:41:33.361 --> 02:41:44.588]  I don't know how I've got it, but I'm just wondering if I should be taking the antibiotics for that, the interferon, because I'm worried sick that they're, you know, sticking something else in me.
[02:41:44.588 --> 02:41:45.649]  Let me try to answer your question.
[02:41:45.649 --> 02:41:46.710]  I appreciate your call, Matt.
[02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:50.032]  Look, I'm not, I can't practice medicine here.
[02:41:50.032 --> 02:41:54.515]  And medicine is very complex and it also depends on the individual, but I know what medical doctors have said.
[02:41:56.277 --> 02:42:07.886]  We've gone from one case in 2004 of leprosy, and no cases before that for decades, to 7,000 in 2005, 2006, the next year.
[02:42:07.886 --> 02:42:10.387]  You can pull these numbers up.
[02:42:10.387 --> 02:42:13.290]  And then we haven't seen numbers since then.
[02:42:13.290 --> 02:42:17.853]  We've gone, I mean, hepatitis, everything's off the charts.
[02:42:17.853 --> 02:42:21.836]  And you can get hepatitis from somebody making your, you know, your hamburger at a fast food place.
[02:42:23.087 --> 02:42:29.908]  And in Mexico, they spray the farms with human feces and then people have gotten hepatitis from that.
[02:42:29.908 --> 02:42:33.369]  It's the third world food.
[02:42:33.369 --> 02:42:43.311]  And then when they create the crisis of the salmonella and the hepatitis, then they say, oh, we need to pass a law shutting down organic farming in the U.S.
[02:42:43.311 --> 02:42:46.912]  But then having no regulations and all the stuff coming in from Latin America.
[02:42:46.912 --> 02:42:48.252]  So that's the biggest issue.
[02:42:50.154 --> 02:42:52.414]  You can't get it from sexual partners, things like that.
[02:42:52.414 --> 02:42:56.095]  That's why they want to give everybody, every baby at birth a hepatitis shot.
[02:42:56.095 --> 02:42:59.896]  And a lot of people have shown evidence that it's actually giving people the hepatitis.
[02:42:59.896 --> 02:43:02.436]  But there's a lot of stuff they've added to vaccines.
[02:43:02.436 --> 02:43:07.717]  There's the factor VIII blood drugs that people are given that have HIV and hepatitis in it.
[02:43:07.717 --> 02:43:09.377]  So it's very, very serious.
[02:43:09.377 --> 02:43:10.858]  Chip in Michigan.
[02:43:10.858 --> 02:43:12.998]  Oh, just to finish another question.
[02:43:12.998 --> 02:43:17.919]  The interferon and all that, there's a lot of studies, a lot of experts, a lot of doctors that say it's the
[02:43:20.839 --> 02:43:27.320]  Drugs that supposedly treat you for HIV and other similar things that actually kill you quicker, but whatever.
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:28.860]  Let's talk to Chip in Michigan.
[02:43:28.860 --> 02:43:30.621]  Chip, you're on the air.
[02:43:30.621 --> 02:43:32.321]  Hey, what's going on, Al?
[02:43:32.321 --> 02:43:33.601]  Doing a worldwide transmission.
[02:43:33.601 --> 02:43:34.702]  Welcome.
[02:43:34.702 --> 02:43:37.982]  I know you don't have all the answers, and I'm not looking for an answer.
[02:43:37.982 --> 02:43:40.503]  I'm just looking for a suggestion.
[02:43:40.503 --> 02:43:47.564]  My father and I, we've watched certain videos, yours, a couple of yours, and we read similar books.
[02:43:48.437 --> 02:43:52.880]  Um, for the past, geez, 15 years or so, we're on kind of the same wavelength.
[02:43:52.880 --> 02:44:10.313]  The, uh, other day I brought over the Obama deception, hot off the presses, um, as far as he's concerned, and, um, normally we watch a video, and he'll press pause, we'll talk about it, we'll continue watching, he'll press pause periodically throughout the video, and we'll discuss it.
[02:44:10.313 --> 02:44:15.817]  During the Obama deception, he pressed pause once, he sat there with his mouth open, and once in a while he'd say,
[02:44:16.727 --> 02:44:18.968]  Wow, holy bleep.
[02:44:18.968 --> 02:44:40.154]  Afterwards, his first comment to me was, and I want you to know that he's 68, he's retired, so when he made this comment to me, he was referring to himself and people in his quote-unquote category, being older and retired and heavily invested in this system.
[02:44:40.154 --> 02:44:45.216]  His first comment to me was, the only thing Alex failed to mention was what we can do about it.
[02:44:45.632 --> 02:44:54.728]  And I was wondering if you could just suggest something that I could tell him and people in his quote-unquote category of retirement.
[02:44:56.186 --> 02:45:12.250]  Well that's a very important question, but overall, it's not hype when I say this film is particularly powerful, because it's so timely, it covers the master plan of the globalists, the bankers, the police state, the grid, and I think therein lies the solution.
[02:45:12.250 --> 02:45:17.511]  We talk about states' rights, we talk about saying no to the feds, we talk about criminally going after the bankers.
[02:45:18.151 --> 02:45:18.391]  I don't know.
[02:45:33.308 --> 02:45:39.911]  I mean, specifically, the solution is not letting them carry out the next phase.
[02:45:39.911 --> 02:45:41.231]  They took control of the government.
[02:45:41.231 --> 02:45:42.232]  They bankrupted us.
[02:45:42.232 --> 02:45:43.892]  They de-industrialized us.
[02:45:43.892 --> 02:45:45.593]  They militarized the police.
[02:45:45.593 --> 02:45:48.854]  They kidnap over 1,400,000 children a year.
[02:45:48.854 --> 02:45:51.015]  They engage in all these hard crimes.
[02:45:51.015 --> 02:45:54.397]  We have to recognize that evil and take abortion.
[02:45:55.157 --> 02:46:08.551]  No, go out with a placard of dead babies, sounds horrible, looks terrible, people get offended, but just folks doing that has gone from around 50% of people being for abortion to now only about 25% in all the major polls.
[02:46:08.551 --> 02:46:09.833]  So we're winning that fight.
[02:46:09.833 --> 02:46:12.296]  The truth is, if we just take, and then you save babies right there.
[02:46:13.116 --> 02:46:15.218]  Men and women don't need to fight with each other.
[02:46:15.218 --> 02:46:16.659]  We've been trained to do it in society.
[02:46:16.659 --> 02:46:22.422]  If you get married and have kids, you've got to stick together, because statistically, it's going to hurt your children if you break up.
[02:46:22.422 --> 02:46:25.604]  Living well, the best revenge is living well, as the French say.
[02:46:25.604 --> 02:46:29.807]  Getting along with your neighbors, being informed, enjoying life, caring about other people.
[02:46:29.807 --> 02:46:32.129]  I mean, I love seeing healthy, happy people.
[02:46:32.129 --> 02:46:34.070]  I love seeing people do well.
[02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:36.752]  I love seeing people, you know, who are creative.
[02:46:37.412 --> 02:46:39.034]  And I thought everybody else was like me.
[02:46:39.034 --> 02:46:45.279]  I didn't know that a lot of folks are, like, diseased mentally from Madison Avenue and they hate seeing other people do well.
[02:46:45.279 --> 02:46:51.825]  You know, again, we've got to get our heads screwed on right and think tribally as a human society against the elites.
[02:46:51.825 --> 02:46:53.967]  Instead, they all try to divide us off against each other.
[02:46:58.038 --> 02:47:05.204]  They're going to say, do whatever we want with the Bank of the World, with regulation, with federalization, and we'll turn the economy back on.
[02:47:05.204 --> 02:47:09.548]  Then they're going to give you some of the money, but then hyperinflate.
[02:47:09.548 --> 02:47:13.572]  And then as things get worse, they're going to say, oh, you didn't do what we said, that's why they got worse.
[02:47:13.572 --> 02:47:18.616]  It's designed to get worse, because things getting worse are better for them.
[02:47:18.616 --> 02:47:20.218]  Your dad says, what do you do about it?
[02:47:22.042 --> 02:47:23.444]  Call the state legislature.
[02:47:23.444 --> 02:47:26.427]  Go for 10th Amendment resolutions.
[02:47:26.427 --> 02:47:28.429]  Educate local police and military.
[02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:32.554]  Just because you're a father and you know all about the stuff doesn't mean your neighbors, your friends, your family.
[02:47:32.554 --> 02:47:36.779]  Number one is education so people know the ballgame they're in.
[02:47:36.779 --> 02:47:38.360]  They know what they're facing.
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:40.002]  They know their enemy.
[02:47:40.002 --> 02:47:40.383]  Okay?
[02:47:40.383 --> 02:47:41.324]  So there's some solutions.
[02:47:44.525 --> 02:47:45.626]  Okay.
[02:47:45.626 --> 02:47:46.486]  I get that.
[02:47:46.486 --> 02:47:48.548]  I was just, I'm looking for a practical thing.
[02:47:48.548 --> 02:47:52.150]  He's looking at me and he's like... Sir, sir, there's no silver bullet.
[02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:53.231]  There's no one thing.
[02:47:53.231 --> 02:47:59.435]  I mean, I can't say you go meet a leprechaun behind the barn and he's gonna, you know, he's gonna fix everything for you.
[02:47:59.435 --> 02:48:01.176]  It's a process.
[02:48:01.176 --> 02:48:04.398]  Looking at my dad and I'm thinking, well, what can I, what can I tell this guy?
[02:48:04.398 --> 02:48:05.939]  He's got a good point.
[02:48:05.939 --> 02:48:06.640]  He's retired.
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:12.504]  He's heavily invested in the system and this kind of information obviously will, and rightfully so,
[02:48:13.117 --> 02:48:15.325]  Totally shatter his reality.
[02:48:15.325 --> 02:48:17.273]  I mean, that would be everything to him.
[02:48:19.158 --> 02:48:20.299]  The system is shattered.
[02:48:20.299 --> 02:48:31.307]  The New World Order built this current grid to get us decadent, get us in debt, get us under their control, so that when they finally try to pull us down, we don't swim to the surface, we go ahead and go down with the Hydra.
[02:48:31.307 --> 02:48:33.268]  Okay, I'll go to the bottom with you.
[02:48:33.268 --> 02:48:35.250]  It's the best system we've got.
[02:48:35.250 --> 02:48:41.214]  You know, they're destroying what they built before and bringing in their New World Order.
[02:48:41.214 --> 02:48:41.714]  Right.
[02:48:41.714 --> 02:48:43.256]  I mean, they've got police at
[02:48:44.102 --> 02:48:51.308]  Announcing you'll be arrested if you don't take vaccines and then having police dogs with thousands of kids crying being injected outside sports stadiums.
[02:48:51.308 --> 02:49:01.996]  I mean, you know, people say, well, Hitler, you know, the Hitlerian system of 1938, I mean, you know, it looks like it's going to get bad, but it's the system I'm invested in.
[02:49:01.996 --> 02:49:07.240]  I don't even claim to have all the answers, but people say, well, what do I do?
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:09.342]  I mean, you know, well, you're smart.
[02:49:09.342 --> 02:49:10.103]  What are you going to do?
[02:49:12.202 --> 02:49:16.646]  Well, like I told you when I first called, I'm not asking for an answer.
[02:49:16.646 --> 02:49:21.690]  All I'm looking at is this old man in the face, and he wants to know what he can do.
[02:49:21.690 --> 02:49:23.612]  Obviously, he's not going around to rallies.
[02:49:23.612 --> 02:49:26.855]  He's not putting DVDs on people's windshields.
[02:49:26.855 --> 02:49:28.456]  Well, why not?
[02:49:28.456 --> 02:49:33.461]  Listen, I appreciate your call, but I've got to say this.
[02:49:33.461 --> 02:49:39.126]  There were people who were ship captains by the time they were 20, because people needed to get their lives going.
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:45.461]  You know, people were considered men by the time they were 12, 13, 14 years old.
[02:49:45.461 --> 02:50:00.485]  Now they teach you, so you're a kid, have fun till college, and then, oh, don't worry about things, party and have fun while you're in college, and, oh, you're a young person now, trying to pay off your college debt, get out there and make it first, and then, oh, I'm too busy with my job, and, oh, now I'm retired, I'm not involved in politics.
[02:50:00.485 --> 02:50:01.145]  It's a cop-out!
[02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:07.333]  Number one, you're not going to be fulfilled till you stand up to tyranny.
[02:50:07.333 --> 02:50:09.034]  You were born to fight tyranny.
[02:50:09.034 --> 02:50:13.497]  Tyranny is always going to be there trying to eat your lunch, trying to take over.
[02:50:13.497 --> 02:50:15.318]  So we're meant to build better communities.
[02:50:15.318 --> 02:50:17.080]  We're meant to be involved.
[02:50:17.080 --> 02:50:21.823]  That's why the establishment creates counterfeits of that, to try to control things.
[02:50:21.823 --> 02:50:25.865]  And you said, well, you said, I wasn't asking for an answer.
[02:50:25.865 --> 02:50:29.328]  You know, kind of implying I didn't give you one.
[02:50:29.328 --> 02:50:30.689]  You want a solution, look in the mirror.
[02:50:31.773 --> 02:50:37.596]  Uh, you know, what is it when I get up here and expose federal documents saying the American people are terrorists?
[02:50:37.596 --> 02:50:38.836]  That is a big solution.
[02:50:38.836 --> 02:50:51.282]  Exposing how out of control they are, how tyrannical they are, how the government is arraying itself to wage war with the people and announcing regular army will be used against us.
[02:50:51.282 --> 02:50:51.882]  What is that?
[02:50:53.902 --> 02:50:55.685]  That is tyranny.
[02:50:55.685 --> 02:50:57.228]  So there's another solution.
[02:50:57.228 --> 02:50:58.711]  Expose their crimes.
[02:50:58.711 --> 02:51:00.014]  What did the founders do?
[02:51:00.014 --> 02:51:01.076]  Committees of Correspondence.
[02:51:01.076 --> 02:51:01.617]  They exposed it.
[02:51:02.645 --> 02:51:07.047]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[02:51:07.047 --> 02:51:08.828]  Genetically modifying.
[02:51:08.828 --> 02:51:14.190]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[02:51:14.190 --> 02:51:15.230]  Viruses.
[02:51:15.230 --> 02:51:20.972]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[02:51:20.972 --> 02:51:23.153]  Starve or surrender.
[02:51:23.153 --> 02:51:23.934]  Surrender.
[02:51:23.934 --> 02:51:27.735]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[02:51:27.735 --> 02:51:28.636]  What then?
[02:51:31.343 --> 02:51:34.424]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[02:51:34.424 --> 02:51:38.765]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[02:51:38.765 --> 02:51:41.625]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[02:51:41.625 --> 02:51:48.847]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[02:51:48.847 --> 02:51:50.748]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[02:51:50.748 --> 02:51:56.169]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[02:51:56.169 --> 02:51:58.890]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.

[02:52:02.119 --> 02:52:07.922]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.922 --> 02:52:15.506]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.506 --> 02:52:21.669]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:22.029 --> 02:52:24.070]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:26.572]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.572 --> 02:52:38.138]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:38.138 --> 02:52:39.819]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.819 --> 02:52:41.680]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:47.903]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:48.573 --> 02:52:56.834]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:56.834 --> 02:52:58.415]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.415 --> 02:53:01.495]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.495 --> 02:53:03.976]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnobel with Midas Resources.
[02:53:03.976 --> 02:53:07.756]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[02:53:07.756 --> 02:53:10.577]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:53:10.577 --> 02:53:17.778]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[02:53:17.918 --> 02:53:23.003]  Having your hard-earned money in banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is a lose-lose deal.
[02:53:23.003 --> 02:53:28.149]  You'll lose on your capital investment, and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar continues to devalue.
[02:53:28.149 --> 02:53:34.255]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[02:53:34.375 --> 02:53:38.516]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[02:53:38.516 --> 02:53:44.337]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:53:44.337 --> 02:53:49.378]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[02:53:49.378 --> 02:53:53.819]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:53:53.819 --> 02:53:56.479]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[02:53:56.479 --> 02:53:56.939]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:54:15.088 --> 02:54:33.639]  Ira Hayes Ira Hayes Call him Truckin' Ira Hayes He won't answer anymore Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian Nor the Marine that went to war
[02:54:43.125 --> 02:54:54.030]  You know, I don't claim to have all the answers, but I certainly know historically what tyranny is, and I know it's a lot worse than freedom.
[02:54:54.030 --> 02:55:03.755]  But I also find a lot of the public, and people that want to write books, people that want to make films, people that want to do radio shows, they'll talk and plan and have endless meetings and
[02:55:05.253 --> 02:55:11.615]  Announce all these big wild ideas, and then never put it into action.
[02:55:11.615 --> 02:55:28.460]  I've made 22 films, produced a couple others, written a book, published a book, created a bunch of websites, done tens of thousands of hours of radio, traveled all over the country and the world confronting corruption, and I'm not tooting my horn here.
[02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:32.361]  I'm saying I've taken action.
[02:55:32.361 --> 02:55:33.562]  And are my films perfect?
[02:55:33.562 --> 02:55:34.522]  Is my work perfect?
[02:55:35.619 --> 02:55:36.060]  I do.
[02:55:36.060 --> 02:55:38.802]  You know, am I the slickest guy on the radio?
[02:55:38.802 --> 02:55:39.802]  No.
[02:55:39.802 --> 02:55:42.464]  But it's real and that's what matters.
[02:55:42.464 --> 02:55:46.848]  And so I would just challenge people out there to stop
[02:55:48.365 --> 02:55:50.987]  Spending your whole life saying, what can I do, what can I do?
[02:55:50.987 --> 02:55:52.168]  And then, well, my dad's 69.
[02:55:52.168 --> 02:55:55.590]  He isn't going to put DVDs on windshields.
[02:55:55.590 --> 02:55:56.511]  Really?
[02:55:56.511 --> 02:56:04.016]  At Lexington and Concord, a large percentage, in fact, close to a third of the people were above 70 that fought the British.
[02:56:04.016 --> 02:56:08.259]  There were 75, 85, 89-year-old people out there blasting British.
[02:56:08.259 --> 02:56:14.984]  Now, I'm not saying go out and blast people, you know, because I understand the Founding Fathers were terrorists and bad, and America's bad, according to these federal reports.
[02:56:14.984 --> 02:56:17.285]  My whole issue is, is that
[02:56:18.166 --> 02:56:21.507]  They tell you you're old, so it's your time to just enjoy yourself.
[02:56:21.507 --> 02:56:23.648]  What, watch TV and get Alzheimer's?
[02:56:23.648 --> 02:56:24.428]  Direct link to it?
[02:56:24.428 --> 02:56:28.970]  Just sitting around all day watching TV, or maybe you go play golf, or you go fart around and play dominoes.
[02:56:28.970 --> 02:56:30.351]  I mean, that isn't living.
[02:56:30.351 --> 02:56:35.593]  Who told you your life doesn't matter now, or you don't have value, or nobody should hear from you?
[02:56:35.593 --> 02:56:38.213]  Plus, young people are like, ah, shut up, old man.
[02:56:38.213 --> 02:56:40.955]  And then old folks are like, ah, shut up, you dumb kids.
[02:56:40.955 --> 02:56:42.015]  We're all together.
[02:56:43.908 --> 02:56:47.952]  Young folks are meant to hang out with old folks, and old folks like to hang out with young folks.
[02:56:47.952 --> 02:56:53.356]  See, they've taken all the natural order of things and screwed them all up.
[02:56:53.356 --> 02:56:59.341]  To all these young 18-year-olds, you know how boring it is to hang out with a bunch of 18-year-old guys?
[02:56:59.341 --> 02:57:02.524]  But it's interesting to hang around with some old Korean war vet.
[02:57:02.524 --> 02:57:05.326]  Get him to talk about stories of people in foxholes.
[02:57:06.346 --> 02:57:12.510]  Or women, or, you know, I mean, that's who you want to hang out with.
[02:57:12.510 --> 02:57:14.771]  Whoosh is in there.
[02:57:14.771 --> 02:57:16.332]  No, have you ever hung out with old men?
[02:57:16.332 --> 02:57:17.953]  I mean, literally been around the world?
[02:57:17.953 --> 02:57:20.474]  It's interesting.
[02:57:20.474 --> 02:57:21.395]  That's where you get the knowledge.
[02:57:21.395 --> 02:57:22.656]  You get it all boiled down.
[02:57:22.656 --> 02:57:25.237]  Instead, you got all these old men who think their life's over.
[02:57:25.237 --> 02:57:26.578]  They don't have anything to give now.
[02:57:26.578 --> 02:57:28.179]  They don't matter.
[02:57:28.179 --> 02:57:30.340]  Look, I don't care if you're 10 years old or if you're 95 years old.
[02:57:31.758 --> 02:57:38.401]  You got a job to do fighting corruption, and you have value, and you have a job to do.
[02:57:38.401 --> 02:57:43.764]  Now, I've already been ranting, and I said I'd take phone calls, and we got an economist coming up.
[02:57:43.764 --> 02:57:47.186]  Where's my bio sheet on what's happening and what happened in Argentina?
[02:57:49.025 --> 02:57:53.848]  So that's coming up, and we'll take a few calls in this next segment, and then go to our guests at the 8 after.
[02:57:53.848 --> 02:57:56.890]  It'll be very informative, so stay with us on that.
[02:57:56.890 --> 02:58:08.738]  Before I go any further, though, again, I want to encourage all the listeners and viewers of this show right now to not procrastinate, to not wait, to not screw around, to get the Obama deception.
[02:58:08.738 --> 02:58:10.579]  There's a lot of simple things you can do.
[02:58:10.579 --> 02:58:11.540]  You say, what's the solution?
[02:58:12.844 --> 02:58:18.667]  Instead of talking to yourself, blowing your face to your neighbors, tell them about the free podcast at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:18.667 --> 02:58:20.889]  Just send them the link and say, hey, listen to this for free.
[02:58:20.889 --> 02:58:23.250]  Here's the audio stream at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:23.250 --> 02:58:30.034]  Or go get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and share your passcode and username with a few friends and family.
[02:58:30.034 --> 02:58:35.137]  You know, get them to watch The Obama Deception in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:35.137 --> 02:58:37.098]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:37.098 --> 02:58:38.199]  Make copies of it.
[02:58:38.199 --> 02:58:41.241]  You know, there's a lot you can do, but just quit sitting on your hind end.
[02:58:43.149 --> 02:58:46.812]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.812 --> 02:58:51.676]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.676 --> 02:58:52.317]  Hello, friends.
[02:58:52.317 --> 02:58:53.377]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.377 --> 02:58:58.121]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:58.121 --> 02:59:01.084]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:01.084 --> 02:59:04.126]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:04.126 --> 02:59:09.971]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:10.191 --> 02:59:13.434]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.434 --> 02:59:20.419]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[02:59:40.850 --> 02:59:42.831]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.395 --> 02:59:56.776]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.776 --> 02:59:59.497]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.294 --> 03:00:27.335]  Alright, who's up next here?
[03:00:27.335 --> 03:00:30.077]  Joshua in Florida.
[03:00:30.077 --> 03:00:30.918]  You are on the air.
[03:00:30.918 --> 03:00:31.158]  Welcome.
[03:00:56.135 --> 03:00:58.117]  Alex Jones, how are you my friend?
[03:00:58.117 --> 03:00:59.619]  Good, buddy.
[03:00:59.619 --> 03:01:02.682]  I wanted to actually comment quickly on the last caller.
[03:01:02.682 --> 03:01:07.587]  I would encourage all the people that follow into that demographic to get involved with the AARP.
[03:01:09.668 --> 03:01:12.329]  And use that as a vehicle to really spread this information.
[03:01:12.329 --> 03:01:13.590]  I think he could do that.
[03:01:13.590 --> 03:01:14.691]  That would be helpful.
[03:01:14.691 --> 03:01:16.952]  Well, I mean, look, I'm not mad at the caller.
[03:01:16.952 --> 03:01:19.213]  He was a nice guy, but he said, give me solutions.
[03:01:19.213 --> 03:01:23.795]  And then he said, oh, that's not really, you know, he acted like I didn't give him one.
[03:01:23.795 --> 03:01:30.639]  So, I mean, only politicians are going to tell you everything's fine if you just do what they say.
[03:01:30.639 --> 03:01:31.840]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:33.741]  Also, I wanted to comment, man.
[03:01:33.741 --> 03:01:36.722]  You were on the Alan Cohn Show the other day, and that was excellent.
[03:01:36.722 --> 03:01:37.923]  We really enjoyed that.
[03:01:38.809 --> 03:01:58.315]  And it worked out perfectly because the whole week, building up to your appearance on the show, our group here in Orlando, we were calling Allen every night talking about the civilian inmate labor program, talking about the MIAC report, and then you were just able to come in on Friday and completely tie everything up, so that was great.
[03:01:58.315 --> 03:01:59.796]  Oh, good!
[03:01:59.796 --> 03:02:07.238]  I guess with the tea parties that are going on, there's definitely going to be a big one here in Orlando tomorrow at Iola Park.
[03:02:08.151 --> 03:02:14.256]  Supposed to be about 6,000 people, but we do have a group of about 20 people and a couple of bullhorns.
[03:02:14.256 --> 03:02:15.537]  We're going to go down there tomorrow.
[03:02:15.537 --> 03:02:24.725]  We have close to 1,000 DVDs, probably more by then, to give out with the Obama deception and all kinds of other stuff.
[03:02:24.725 --> 03:02:29.228]  And I just, I want to encourage people who are in Florida who are wanting to get active.
[03:02:29.228 --> 03:02:32.751]  Maybe, you know, this is the first time you're hearing this and you don't know where to go to.
[03:02:32.751 --> 03:02:36.074]  You can go to www.meetup.com backslash
[03:02:36.866 --> 03:02:38.066]  Orlando 9-11 Truth.
[03:02:38.066 --> 03:02:39.447]  We do a lot of stuff.
[03:02:39.447 --> 03:02:45.689]  And last thing, I'll let you go Alex, I know you got a lot to do, but we're going to have a special celebrity endorsement tomorrow.
[03:02:45.689 --> 03:02:52.391]  We got a life-size Barack Obama cutout we're taking to the rally with us, with a speech bubble that says,
[03:02:54.676 --> 03:02:55.796]  Same agenda.
[03:02:55.796 --> 03:02:57.257]  One world government.
[03:02:57.257 --> 03:02:59.318]  Well done.
[03:02:59.318 --> 03:03:00.338]  Good to hear from you.
[03:03:00.338 --> 03:03:03.119]  And again, folks are calling in going, what are solutions?
[03:03:03.119 --> 03:03:04.740]  The power of the people.
[03:03:04.740 --> 03:03:06.601]  Just with the Obama deception.
[03:03:06.601 --> 03:03:11.863]  I mean, people are sending me videos all over the country of huge DVD copiers, which aren't even that expensive.
[03:03:11.863 --> 03:03:15.424]  Just copying, copying, copying, and giving it to everybody.
[03:03:15.424 --> 03:03:17.665]  And this film's been out for a month.
[03:03:18.385 --> 03:03:20.786]  Tens of millions of views online for free.
[03:03:20.786 --> 03:03:25.087]  The thousands of DVDs we've shipped out in the highest quality being copied everywhere.
[03:03:25.087 --> 03:03:26.628]  It is explosive!
[03:03:26.628 --> 03:03:31.369]  And then we've got these giant CDN servers.
[03:03:31.369 --> 03:03:36.391]  And we've told listeners, PrisonPlanet.tv members, you can share it with six friends and family.
[03:03:36.391 --> 03:03:41.013]  Just tell them don't share it because then it'll bankrupt us or the servers will shut down.
[03:03:41.013 --> 03:03:44.754]  I got a $40,000 bill or something for the overage.
[03:03:44.754 --> 03:03:46.275]  Yeah, that's where the video
[03:03:48.975 --> 03:03:52.897]  The film sales go right back into the servers to pay to give it out.
[03:03:52.897 --> 03:03:57.179]  And that's because the members, we let members give it out to like ten people.
[03:03:57.179 --> 03:04:05.122]  You know, ten people could enter the passcode and use it at any one time.
[03:04:05.122 --> 03:04:13.726]  And they just shared it with everybody and it was just really financial hardship on that end to have done that.
[03:04:13.726 --> 03:04:16.707]  But that's when you know you get success when you're, you know, using
[03:04:17.816 --> 03:04:21.839]  What was it, like 90 terabytes or something for the Obamaception?
[03:04:21.839 --> 03:04:23.080]  Hey Matt, what was it?
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:25.442]  90 terabytes last month?
[03:04:25.442 --> 03:04:26.923]  They don't even hear me out there.
[03:04:26.923 --> 03:04:28.484]  90 terabytes?
[03:04:28.484 --> 03:04:31.486]  Over 90 terabytes?
[03:04:31.486 --> 03:04:32.767]  Over 90 terabytes.
[03:04:32.767 --> 03:04:35.950]  For folks in IT, you know what that means.
[03:04:35.950 --> 03:04:37.951]  90 terabytes.
[03:04:37.951 --> 03:04:40.974]  Now that's serving a video out, baby.
[03:04:40.974 --> 03:04:42.535]  That is serving a video out.
[03:04:43.766 --> 03:04:49.371]  And now, you know, it took me years just to get the money to have servers and people that could run them that can handle that.
[03:04:49.371 --> 03:04:54.695]  Because we're talking about 90 terabytes in a month.
[03:04:54.695 --> 03:04:55.836]  And $40,000.
[03:04:55.836 --> 03:05:00.120]  So, go buy the DVDs at InfoWars.com, folks.
[03:05:00.120 --> 03:05:00.741]  We need the money.
[03:05:01.809 --> 03:05:09.011]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:05:09.011 --> 03:05:13.572]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:05:13.572 --> 03:05:19.174]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[03:05:19.174 --> 03:05:26.256]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:05:26.716 --> 03:05:32.099]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[03:05:32.099 --> 03:05:37.961]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:05:37.961 --> 03:05:43.404]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[03:05:53.848 --> 03:05:55.949]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:06:05.330 --> 03:06:07.954]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.954 --> 03:06:15.005]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.524 --> 03:06:22.050]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:22.050 --> 03:06:24.092]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:24.092 --> 03:06:26.595]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.595 --> 03:06:37.545]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.169 --> 03:06:39.830]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:41.690]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:48.593]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.593 --> 03:06:56.856]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.856 --> 03:06:58.436]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.436 --> 03:06:59.617]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:05.383]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:07:05.383 --> 03:07:10.786]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:07:10.786 --> 03:07:15.950]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:07:15.950 --> 03:07:27.058]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:07:27.458 --> 03:07:33.241]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:07:33.241 --> 03:07:39.504]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:07:39.504 --> 03:07:40.524]  What about you?
[03:07:40.524 --> 03:07:46.968]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:08:02.221 --> 03:08:05.003]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.003 --> 03:08:07.825]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:25.114 --> 03:08:26.595]  This is always happening.
[03:08:26.595 --> 03:08:36.079]  Adrian Salvucci, the economist down in Argentina, documenting what their collapse was like by design with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
[03:08:36.079 --> 03:08:39.260]  Having trouble getting connected to him in Argentina.
[03:08:39.260 --> 03:08:43.262]  Way down there on the tip of South America.
[03:08:43.262 --> 03:08:44.503]  So that's coming up.
[03:08:44.503 --> 03:08:45.683]  If he's not on today, it'll be on tomorrow.
[03:08:45.683 --> 03:08:46.163]  It doesn't matter.
[03:08:46.163 --> 03:08:49.985]  I've got just tons of important news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[03:08:49.985 --> 03:08:53.887]  Like 9-1-1 Commission Council, government agreed to lie about 9-11.
[03:08:56.158 --> 03:09:04.943]  The big prestigious talkers magazine has listed me in the top 50 talkers of 2009.
[03:09:04.943 --> 03:09:08.185]  All these years they've ignored me.
[03:09:08.185 --> 03:09:23.074]  And they stuck me in here with Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mike Gallagher, and all these other people like Michael Savage and Mark Levine.
[03:09:23.074 --> 03:09:24.015]  This is ridiculous.
[03:09:26.860 --> 03:09:29.602]  I almost don't even like being on the map with these people.
[03:09:29.602 --> 03:09:30.922]  But, Talker sent me a note.
[03:09:30.922 --> 03:09:33.163]  Dr. Loris Lessinger.
[03:09:33.163 --> 03:09:46.191]  But I guess I should feel nice that, uh, that they included me in this.
[03:09:46.191 --> 03:09:47.291]  Very bizarre, though.
[03:09:47.291 --> 03:09:51.754]  Where do they get these 50 people?
[03:09:51.754 --> 03:09:52.394]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[03:09:57.193 --> 03:09:59.574]  This was just sent to me.
[03:09:59.574 --> 03:10:04.497]  Okay, anyways, let's continue with your phone calls here.
[03:10:04.497 --> 03:10:06.598]  Let's talk to Dan in Pennsylvania.
[03:10:06.598 --> 03:10:08.279]  Dan, you're on the air.
[03:10:08.279 --> 03:10:09.359]  Hi, Alex?
[03:10:09.359 --> 03:10:10.100]  Yes, sir.
[03:10:10.100 --> 03:10:10.820]  Yes, hello.
[03:10:10.820 --> 03:10:12.401]  Good afternoon.
[03:10:12.401 --> 03:10:18.024]  I have a lot of issues that I could bring up, but I have two major ones that I'd like to bring up.
[03:10:18.024 --> 03:10:22.446]  One is the thing about Obama wanting to have national service on 9-11.
[03:10:26.809 --> 03:10:27.389]  What is it?
[03:10:27.389 --> 03:10:43.959]  I just wondered if anybody has thought about two days beforehand of this year, because I'm thinking that might be like a false flag terror thing that's going to happen on September 9th, 2009.
[03:10:43.959 --> 03:10:47.681]  Oh, that would be 999, wouldn't it?
[03:10:47.681 --> 03:10:48.942]  Yeah, turn it upside down. 666.
[03:10:51.598 --> 03:10:52.459]  Exactly.
[03:10:52.459 --> 03:10:56.784]  Well look at how they bombed Madrid on 333.
[03:10:56.784 --> 03:10:58.506]  Look at 7-7.
[03:10:58.506 --> 03:10:59.648]  Look at all the other bombings.
[03:10:59.648 --> 03:11:05.775]  They always do it on weird cryptic numbers because not that we believe in that, it's them that believe in this weird Babylon mystery school.
[03:11:06.776 --> 03:11:10.259]  A numerology system.
[03:11:10.259 --> 03:11:12.961]  But folks thought it would be really bad on 666.
[03:11:12.961 --> 03:11:14.922]  You know, 2006.
[03:11:14.922 --> 03:11:17.184]  Six months, six days.
[03:11:17.184 --> 03:11:18.525]  And nothing really happened.
[03:11:18.525 --> 03:11:21.748]  So sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.
[03:11:21.748 --> 03:11:24.950]  But there's no doubt they want National Compulsory Service.
[03:11:24.950 --> 03:11:26.852]  The bills are introduced.
[03:11:26.852 --> 03:11:28.793]  They pulled it out of one version, put it back in a new one.
[03:11:28.793 --> 03:11:28.813]  1444.
[03:11:28.813 --> 03:11:28.993]  Or 1444.
[03:11:28.993 --> 03:11:30.474]  And so that's certainly all going on.
[03:11:34.229 --> 03:11:40.952]  Yeah, and that's just one of my thoughts when the next false flag terror will happen.
[03:11:40.952 --> 03:11:50.176]  Also, I'm 41 years old and I haven't had any vaccinations, flu shots, or anything at all.
[03:11:50.176 --> 03:11:54.437]  My mother didn't believe in them at all since I was a kid and everything like that.
[03:11:54.437 --> 03:11:55.998]  Was she with Al Qaeda?
[03:11:59.295 --> 03:12:01.157]  Yeah, and I only had a tetanus shot when I was like 17.
[03:12:01.157 --> 03:12:02.258]  That's the last shot I had like that.
[03:12:02.258 --> 03:12:06.081]  And I'm just wondering if there's anybody else out there that has been like that.
[03:12:20.147 --> 03:12:29.692]  Yeah, I haven't had a vaccine since I had surgery for a broken leg when I was 16 and they gave me a tetanus shot.
[03:12:29.692 --> 03:12:31.453]  So I haven't had any vaccine since 16 either.
[03:12:31.453 --> 03:12:42.239]  Yeah, I mean, I could go on and on and on, especially about family court and you name it, you know, because I haven't seen my kids in almost three years because of that.
[03:12:43.769 --> 03:12:46.530]  Well, what happens is they don't even give them to grandparents now.
[03:12:46.530 --> 03:12:48.792]  In fact, John, I sent you a bunch of clips of those.
[03:12:48.792 --> 03:12:53.314]  You got those news clips?
[03:12:53.314 --> 03:12:56.415]  Okay, well I'm... Yeah, we're going to play that clip later.
[03:12:56.415 --> 03:12:58.316]  Thank you so much for the call, Dan.
[03:12:58.316 --> 03:13:00.838]  Jim in Pennsylvania, then Marie in Germany and others.
[03:13:00.838 --> 03:13:01.618]  Jim, you're on the air.
[03:13:01.618 --> 03:13:03.279]  Hi, Alex.
[03:13:03.279 --> 03:13:04.079]  How you doing?
[03:13:04.079 --> 03:13:05.660]  Good.
[03:13:05.660 --> 03:13:07.221]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[03:13:07.221 --> 03:13:07.941]  Honor to talk to you.
[03:13:07.941 --> 03:13:09.322]  Welcome.
[03:13:09.322 --> 03:13:12.904]  Well, I just wanted to comment on what you were talking about earlier.
[03:13:14.105 --> 03:13:16.146]  Uh, getting active and doing different things.
[03:13:16.146 --> 03:13:19.506]  I'm a student up here at Kutztown University.
[03:13:19.506 --> 03:13:20.747]  I've been doing all I can now.
[03:13:20.747 --> 03:13:28.249]  It's putting flyers out, giving people links, giving people copies of the DVD, whatever I can do.
[03:13:28.249 --> 03:13:29.669]  Well, thank you, sir.
[03:13:29.669 --> 03:13:31.489]  Yes.
[03:13:31.489 --> 03:13:41.972]  Sorry, I thought I disconnected, but yeah, um, you know, I've been, I've been getting everybody from left-wing, right-left-wing, all the, tried to open their eyes, tried to look into what's going on.
[03:13:43.953 --> 03:13:49.575]  What do you think about all these governors and talk show hosts and Ann Coulter saying they want to fight the New World Order?
[03:13:49.575 --> 03:13:52.996]  Didn't exist all these years, but now they want to fight it!
[03:13:52.996 --> 03:13:54.996]  I think it's hilarious.
[03:13:54.996 --> 03:14:00.798]  I think it's just so... Everybody's getting to think one way, and they're trying to jump on our side and try to...
[03:14:01.889 --> 03:14:05.670]  There's a consensus with the population that's opening their eyes.
[03:14:05.670 --> 03:14:07.290]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:14:07.290 --> 03:14:11.071]  But they want to make us think that they're on our side.
[03:14:11.071 --> 03:14:14.371]  Just like Benedict Arnold in the Revolutionary War.
[03:14:14.371 --> 03:14:17.332]  They tried to deny this because they were part of it.
[03:14:17.332 --> 03:14:21.893]  And then now that they know we're becoming the majority, they're trying to act like they're with us.
[03:14:21.893 --> 03:14:25.373]  But you look at their actions, it's the opposite.
[03:14:25.373 --> 03:14:26.674]  It's going to be betrayal.
[03:14:26.674 --> 03:14:27.934]  Yeah.
[03:14:28.812 --> 03:14:29.933]  I got another thing to say.
[03:14:29.933 --> 03:14:46.201]  I'm up here on a college campus, and I've been noticing little by little, you know, the last couple months or so, you know, every once in a while I'd walk out and I'd see a military person walking by, people in uniforms, just a group of them walking down the street, and I always found it a little odd.
[03:14:46.201 --> 03:14:55.186]  And I was listening to your interview with Jim Tucker about an hour ago, and you guys were talking about cigarettes, and you got me wanting one, so I went outside, and I'm having a cigarette,
[03:14:56.175 --> 03:15:01.501]  The Van pulls up and it's got a guy in full uniform and a big green van.
[03:15:01.501 --> 03:15:07.807]  He rolls down his window and he says to me, you know you can't smoke that here, you gotta get off campus if you wanna smoke.
[03:15:07.807 --> 03:15:14.374]  And he pulls away and I see he's got a federal bump, he's got a federal license plate on the back of his thing and I was wondering
[03:15:15.069 --> 03:15:19.553]  You know, why are they here and what can we do to get them out of here?
[03:15:19.553 --> 03:15:22.815]  No, no, they're being quietly encouraged to boss people around.
[03:15:22.815 --> 03:15:27.739]  So you'll have a mass shooting, they show up, you'll have a DWI checkpoint, the Army and Marines are there.
[03:15:27.739 --> 03:15:32.823]  You'll have the Governor of Tennessee say, we heard you're going to run illegal checkpoints on highways, you're not allowed to.
[03:15:32.823 --> 03:15:38.047]  And then it was in the Tennessee papers, the Army said, we don't care what the Governor says, we're going to do it.
[03:15:38.047 --> 03:15:42.011]  Because they intend to fully, slowly implode the economy,
[03:15:42.631 --> 03:16:00.827]  And then as the riots and things break out, they'll pose as the saviors, put troops on the streets, the public will say, yay, they restored order, that will then set the precedent for the full military occupation, and then gun confiscation will come after, like Senator Dianne Feinstein said.
[03:16:00.827 --> 03:16:03.129]  She said, we're gonna ban your guns in 60 minutes.
[03:16:03.129 --> 03:16:04.590]  She said, we're gonna ban them.
[03:16:04.590 --> 03:16:06.111]  But she said, we're gonna do it in our own time.
[03:16:06.872 --> 03:16:09.015]  And so they got to first economically hurt us.
[03:16:09.015 --> 03:16:10.356]  You know, they hate our guts.
[03:16:10.356 --> 03:16:15.622]  They're happy to steal, destroy the dollar, crush our future, get us enslaved.
[03:16:15.622 --> 03:16:24.132]  Once they've got that, then, as the IMF engaged in in Argentina and other countries, once things fully implode, then the riots, then the troops.
[03:16:24.132 --> 03:16:26.375]  And we do have
[03:16:28.406 --> 03:16:44.671]  Our next guest on with us, and I appreciate your call, is Adrian El Salbucci, and he's a researcher, author, speaker, international consultant, economist, advisor to international companies, specializing in political, economic, and financial power structures of globalization.
[03:16:44.671 --> 03:16:49.632]  He's a founding member of Argentina's Second Republic Movement.
[03:16:51.109 --> 03:16:59.814]  And he's 56 years old, four children, and he has the website asalbuchi.com.ar.
[03:16:59.814 --> 03:17:04.877]  So A in Salbuchi spelled S-A-L-B-U-C-H-I.
[03:17:04.877 --> 03:17:10.040]  And he's the author of several books on geopolitics, international relations, and other subjects.
[03:17:10.040 --> 03:17:11.340]  The bio goes on and on.
[03:17:12.401 --> 03:17:23.386]  And of course, he wrote a series for major newspapers like World Government, so he's an expert on the New World Order, and he's from Argentina, where they engineered the collapse.
[03:17:23.386 --> 03:17:35.071]  I'll never forget the Washington Post, right after the collapse of Argentina, reported that within two weeks of it happening, middle class people were homeless and a truck dumped over with cattle, and the people were running up, slicing wet blobs of
[03:17:35.731 --> 03:17:36.492]  My pleasure, Alex.
[03:17:36.492 --> 03:17:37.032]  How are you?
[03:17:37.032 --> 03:17:39.454]  Great to say hello to you and your audience.
[03:18:04.690 --> 03:18:08.492]  Well, we had a series of collapses of different characteristics.
[03:18:08.492 --> 03:18:10.993]  We had one in 1975, that's why I always say I'm 56 and I went through three of them.
[03:18:10.993 --> 03:18:15.054]  One in 1975, a much worse one in 1989 that ended in hyperinflation, and the very worst was in 2001-2002, which is the one you're referring to, Alex.
[03:18:24.737 --> 03:18:28.018]  And what happened then is the whole banking system collapsed.
[03:18:28.018 --> 03:18:29.918]  The chain of payments collapsed.
[03:18:29.918 --> 03:18:32.239]  People had their money completely blocked in the bank.
[03:18:32.239 --> 03:18:40.881]  They just couldn't get it out to even buy the most elemental necessities of life or pay their petrol and their gas in their car tanks and so forth.
[03:18:40.881 --> 03:18:43.582]  And as you say, we did have some extreme cases.
[03:18:43.582 --> 03:18:48.323]  That's the one you said, you know, people, very poor people, impoverished people doing anything to have something to eat.
[03:18:48.883 --> 03:19:00.234]  And the net result is that once the whole thing more or less came back under control, about 50% of our population went below the poverty line and they never came back.
[03:19:00.234 --> 03:19:09.783]  They're still down there below the poverty line because these new world order people work with a lot of psychology and they know that people in the long run get used to anything.
[03:19:10.202 --> 03:19:21.579]  So they've arranged to have us all get used to just half the population living below the poverty line, and now it's just more of a question for the police than a question of actually getting things done.
[03:19:21.579 --> 03:19:26.646]  I call it, Alex, when you're in grief over somebody's death.
[03:19:27.026 --> 03:19:34.832]  We've all lost a dear person in our family or a friend, and at first we feel shock, and after that, terrible grief.
[03:19:34.832 --> 03:19:40.356]  And then it's terrible sitting down at the dining table and seeing that the chair where your dad or your mom used to sit is empty.
[03:19:40.356 --> 03:19:44.339]  But after a month, after six months, after a year, you get used to it.
[03:19:44.339 --> 03:19:45.360]  You cope with it.
[03:19:45.740 --> 03:19:48.684]  And they did that, part of the experiment they did with us was that.
[03:19:48.684 --> 03:19:49.845]  They took our money away.
[03:19:49.845 --> 03:19:52.128]  Everybody was banging pots and pans down the street.
[03:19:52.128 --> 03:19:53.970]  Everybody was screaming, yelling.
[03:19:53.970 --> 03:19:56.973]  I had friends that literally, and I myself, wanted to set fire... Stay there!
[03:19:56.973 --> 03:19:57.654]  Stay there, sir!
[03:19:57.654 --> 03:19:58.175]  Gotta break!
[03:19:58.175 --> 03:19:59.396]  Amazing, from Argentina.
[03:19:59.396 --> 03:19:59.816]  Stay with us.
[03:20:02.472 --> 03:20:07.993]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[03:20:07.993 --> 03:20:08.773]  and the world.
[03:20:08.773 --> 03:20:12.634]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[03:20:12.634 --> 03:20:19.136]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[03:20:19.136 --> 03:20:21.176]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[03:20:21.176 --> 03:20:29.118]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[03:20:29.398 --> 03:20:29.978]  We're good to go.
[03:20:57.517 --> 03:21:05.043]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[03:21:05.043 --> 03:21:12.089]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[03:21:12.089 --> 03:21:16.293]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[03:21:16.886 --> 03:21:26.872]  Call me at 800-686-2237 extension 115 and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[03:21:26.872 --> 03:21:36.938]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[03:21:36.938 --> 03:21:40.880]  Call me Duane Daly at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[03:21:44.850 --> 03:21:48.254]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[03:21:48.254 --> 03:21:51.018]  No amount is too small, so start today.
[03:21:51.018 --> 03:21:55.804]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[03:22:01.997 --> 03:22:08.040]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:22:08.040 --> 03:22:13.922]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:22:13.922 --> 03:22:20.065]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:22:20.405 --> 03:22:22.366]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:22:22.366 --> 03:22:24.848]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:22:24.848 --> 03:22:38.037]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:22:38.037 --> 03:22:39.718]  It's not about left or right.
[03:22:39.718 --> 03:22:41.560]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:22:41.560 --> 03:22:47.804]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:22:48.473 --> 03:22:56.721]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:56.721 --> 03:22:58.303]  The Obama Deception.
[03:22:58.303 --> 03:22:59.504]  The people strike back!
[03:23:01.249 --> 03:23:09.513]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[03:23:09.513 --> 03:23:14.076]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[03:23:14.076 --> 03:23:18.738]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[03:23:18.738 --> 03:23:20.159]  It's a documented fact.
[03:23:21.019 --> 03:23:27.783]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[03:23:27.783 --> 03:23:39.891]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[03:23:39.891 --> 03:23:43.553]  FPP is now available to you from FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[03:23:44.153 --> 03:23:47.294]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[03:23:47.294 --> 03:23:51.034]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[03:23:51.034 --> 03:23:54.515]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[03:23:54.515 --> 03:23:54.755]  That's 888-949-3570.
[03:24:13.486 --> 03:24:28.797]  Adrian Salbucci is our guest, economist, researcher.
[03:24:28.797 --> 03:24:37.883]  He wrote back in 1995, World Government, the book, and how they were controlling his nation.
[03:24:37.883 --> 03:24:38.624]  It's the same thing.
[03:24:38.624 --> 03:24:39.705]  Now I'm having World Bank brag.
[03:24:41.038 --> 03:24:43.719]  You heard Jim Tucker earlier with sources inside of Elderburg.
[03:24:43.719 --> 03:24:44.800]  They are celebrating.
[03:24:44.800 --> 03:24:52.323]  Well, George Soros is in the news saying this is the greatest time of his life, the culmination, that he's behind this all.
[03:24:52.323 --> 03:24:55.885]  They can't wait until you're bankrupt under their control.
[03:24:55.885 --> 03:24:57.906]  This is a tool of their control.
[03:24:57.906 --> 03:25:00.167]  They can't wait to turn the police loose on you.
[03:25:00.167 --> 03:25:02.788]  That's why CPS kidnaps people's kids that are poor.
[03:25:02.788 --> 03:25:03.768]  They want all your kids.
[03:25:03.768 --> 03:25:04.709]  This is them taking over.
[03:25:06.135 --> 03:25:07.315]  This is a military operation.
[03:25:07.315 --> 03:25:14.658]  Okay, Mr. Salvucci, continuing, you've lived through this, and I love the analogy you do, showing a peso and the devaluation of it.
[03:25:14.658 --> 03:25:18.600]  Continue with what the globalists are doing and what's going to happen here.
[03:25:18.600 --> 03:25:30.645]  Yeah, what you were saying, Alex, about the peso that I show in the YouTube film is just to show a one peso coin, one Argentine peso coin, will hardly buy you a bus drive in downtown Buenos Aires, and yet
[03:25:31.155 --> 03:25:31.475]  I think so.
[03:25:47.867 --> 03:26:03.624]  And what I was saying just before the break, and this is something that we should all keep in mind, I think that Argentina in 2001 and 2002 when we had our financial banking and monetary collapse and meltdown, in a way we were sort of a trial case.
[03:26:03.624 --> 03:26:05.947]  We were sort of an experiment to see how people would react.
[03:26:06.468 --> 03:26:06.948]  Yes, we are.
[03:26:25.522 --> 03:26:31.106]  And if you had a large savings, fixed deposits and so forth, you couldn't take it out, period, until further advice.
[03:26:31.106 --> 03:26:33.827]  The first reaction of people was to go crazy.
[03:26:33.827 --> 03:26:36.949]  People started banging pots and pans down the street.
[03:26:36.949 --> 03:26:41.292]  They attacked and broke the windows and banks and so forth.
[03:26:41.292 --> 03:26:42.793]  That happened for a while.
[03:26:42.793 --> 03:26:44.534]  After a month, it continued to happen.
[03:26:44.534 --> 03:26:46.595]  After three months, it happened, but a little bit less.
[03:26:46.975 --> 03:26:49.740]  And by the sixth month, people had gotten used to it.
[03:26:49.740 --> 03:26:54.527]  They had sought other alternative ways of surviving, more or less, and they got used to it.
[03:26:54.527 --> 03:27:00.196]  And I was making the analogy of when you lose a dear person who has died, first you're grief-stricken.
[03:27:00.828 --> 03:27:01.048]  I think?
[03:27:22.722 --> 03:27:24.743]  In the long run, people get used to it.
[03:27:24.743 --> 03:27:28.926]  So they probably have taken quite a number of clues from the Argentine experiment.
[03:27:28.926 --> 03:27:31.067]  Let's just let them scream.
[03:27:31.067 --> 03:27:32.408]  Let's let them kick.
[03:27:32.408 --> 03:27:34.129]  Let's let them have their temper tantrum.
[03:27:34.129 --> 03:27:38.731]  But in the long run, our answer is tough luck, and people end up getting used to it.
[03:27:38.731 --> 03:27:41.733]  So in a way, I think that's what they're going to be doing with you guys.
[03:27:42.313 --> 03:27:47.496]  Exactly, I don't want you to talk about that, but in 2002, the IMF World Bank documents got leaked.
[03:27:47.496 --> 03:27:56.862]  BBC reported how they bragged, how they'd engineered that in Argentina, and how they shut the bank money off, even though they had it, to create a loss of confidence.
[03:27:58.175 --> 03:28:06.088]  So people would panic, but I want you to speak to that, but I want folks to understand, Latin America has more resources in South America than the U.S.
[03:28:06.088 --> 03:28:07.229]  does many times over.
[03:28:07.229 --> 03:28:08.852]  The people are hardworking too.
[03:28:08.852 --> 03:28:12.878]  The elites brag that they hyperinflate things every
[03:28:13.419 --> 03:28:14.860]  We're good to go.
[03:28:42.708 --> 03:28:44.449]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:28:44.449 --> 03:28:48.250]  I hate to say this, but unfortunately, you are right to a great extent.
[03:28:48.250 --> 03:28:52.952]  I think we have to keep in mind that economics, in a way, is a branch of psychology.
[03:28:52.952 --> 03:28:55.854]  And the greater the crisis, the more psychological it is.
[03:28:55.854 --> 03:29:08.279]  Because whatever you do to keep your assets, whether it be money, shares, other currencies, and so forth, it's all based on your psychological perception of how good or how bad a particular currency is.
[03:29:08.279 --> 03:29:08.739]  For example,
[03:29:09.059 --> 03:29:21.445]  We didn't stick on to Argentinian pesos because we knew that they were inflating, they were becoming grossly devalued, and we would stick on to dollars, which in 2001 and 2002 was sort of our version of flight to safety.
[03:29:21.445 --> 03:29:27.768]  Now I think we have to keep very much in mind that there is a very large psychological factor behind all of this.
[03:29:27.768 --> 03:29:31.790]  They are in a way trying to take all the options and the alternatives away from us.
[03:29:32.790 --> 03:29:33.331]  Stay there.
[03:29:33.331 --> 03:29:34.031]  Stay there, sir.
[03:29:34.031 --> 03:29:34.892]  That was a short segment.
[03:29:34.892 --> 03:29:42.937]  Long segment coming up with the economist and author from Argentina, who was writing about the New World Order back in the mid-1990s, fully aware of what's happening.
[03:29:42.937 --> 03:29:44.438]  We'll come right back to him on the other side.
[03:29:44.438 --> 03:29:46.780]  We really appreciate you joining us, sir.
[03:29:46.780 --> 03:29:48.461]  We'll be right back with Adrian Salvucci.
[03:29:48.461 --> 03:29:52.043]  Stay with us.
[03:29:52.043 --> 03:29:53.424]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.424 --> 03:29:55.966]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.966 --> 03:29:58.668]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.262 --> 03:30:06.785]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[03:30:06.785 --> 03:30:11.888]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:30:11.888 --> 03:30:13.389]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:30:13.389 --> 03:30:16.992]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[03:30:16.992 --> 03:30:22.415]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[03:30:22.415 --> 03:30:28.179]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[03:30:28.499 --> 03:30:31.020]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[03:30:31.020 --> 03:30:33.560]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[03:30:37.181 --> 03:30:38.362]  No animal testing.
[03:30:38.362 --> 03:30:39.702]  I use them and love them.
[03:30:39.702 --> 03:30:41.603]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[03:30:41.603 --> 03:30:43.003]  And I say it big time.
[03:30:43.003 --> 03:30:44.463]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[03:30:44.463 --> 03:30:44.683]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[03:30:54.486 --> 03:31:02.411]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[03:31:02.411 --> 03:31:08.214]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:08.214 --> 03:31:15.798]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:31:15.798 --> 03:31:21.942]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.362 --> 03:31:24.343]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.343 --> 03:31:26.845]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.845 --> 03:31:38.431]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.431 --> 03:31:40.092]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:40.092 --> 03:31:41.953]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.953 --> 03:31:48.176]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:48.866 --> 03:31:57.140]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:57.140 --> 03:31:58.703]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.703 --> 03:31:59.905]  The people strike back!
[03:32:01.969 --> 03:32:03.430]  So you want to stop smoking.
[03:32:03.430 --> 03:32:04.711]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[03:32:04.711 --> 03:32:07.594]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[03:32:07.594 --> 03:32:11.577]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[03:32:11.577 --> 03:32:15.361]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[03:32:15.361 --> 03:32:17.362]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[03:32:17.362 --> 03:32:21.686]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[03:32:21.686 --> 03:32:24.589]  Smokefree is a complete, all-natural stop smoking system.
[03:32:24.589 --> 03:32:28.332]  And when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program, absolutely free.
[03:32:28.732 --> 03:32:29.433]  We're good to go.
[03:32:46.311 --> 03:32:46.952]  Call 1-800-426-6186 today!
[03:33:25.563 --> 03:33:33.862]  We're going back to our guest in just one moment.
[03:33:35.242 --> 03:33:38.285]  Got on about 20 minutes late because of phone problems to Argentina.
[03:33:38.285 --> 03:33:41.208]  But we're going to have him back up in the next few weeks.
[03:33:41.208 --> 03:33:49.035]  He's an amazing political mind and I want him to be able to roll with the same people orchestrating their implosion, orchestrating ours.
[03:33:49.035 --> 03:33:50.096]  And we have the documents.
[03:33:50.096 --> 03:33:51.538]  This has even been in mainstream news.
[03:33:51.538 --> 03:33:52.999]  I mean, they're cold-blooded.
[03:33:52.999 --> 03:33:53.760]  The same folks.
[03:33:53.760 --> 03:33:54.741]  They're ruthless.
[03:33:54.741 --> 03:33:56.342]  That's why they're in power.
[03:33:56.342 --> 03:33:59.725]  Meanwhile, they've got their frontman, Obama, acting like he's going to fix it all.
[03:34:00.746 --> 03:34:06.547]  Before we go back to our guest, I wanted to tell you about a few of our sponsors.
[03:34:06.547 --> 03:34:10.648]  One of them is SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[03:34:10.648 --> 03:34:15.829]  You can now grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free of the New World Order.
[03:34:15.829 --> 03:34:17.329]  You need to get self-sufficient, folks.
[03:34:17.329 --> 03:34:19.049]  These people are vicious.
[03:34:19.049 --> 03:34:20.370]  They're shutting things down.
[03:34:20.370 --> 03:34:25.451]  Survivalist Seeds has now drastically reduced their price on heirloom seeds to the lowest out there.
[03:34:25.451 --> 03:34:26.791]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[03:34:27.831 --> 03:34:30.133]  Get 6,000 heirloom seeds for a really low price.
[03:34:30.133 --> 03:34:31.254]  Be sure and check it out.
[03:34:31.254 --> 03:34:39.883]  There's a real heirloom seed shortage right now as people interested in growing their own healthy food need to get their heirloom seeds now and start their gardens this spring.
[03:34:39.883 --> 03:34:40.984]  Freedom starts with action.
[03:34:40.984 --> 03:34:47.049]  Survivalistseeds.com is how you survive the world economic collapse that the globalists are engineering.
[03:34:47.049 --> 03:34:51.894]  Also, another fine sponsor dealing with preparedness is Pepperspray.com.
[03:34:55.540 --> 03:34:58.681]  We live in an unpredictable world, and as everyone knows, I'm all about preparedness.
[03:34:58.681 --> 03:35:01.402]  Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[03:35:01.402 --> 03:35:08.405]  That's why I want you to visit our new sponsor, Pepperspray.com, to check out their wide variety of personal security products they have available on their website.
[03:35:08.405 --> 03:35:12.467]  Since 1994, Pepperspray.com has made your personal safety their number one priority.
[03:35:13.459 --> 03:35:17.041]  So give them a call at 1-800-908-9988.
[03:35:17.041 --> 03:35:18.221]  Again, that number is 1-800-908-9988.
[03:35:18.221 --> 03:35:22.843]  Or visit them at Pepperspray.com and give yourself some peace of mind.
[03:35:22.843 --> 03:35:25.204]  They've been on the web since 94.
[03:35:25.204 --> 03:35:27.465]  Wide variety of personal safety and security products.
[03:35:27.465 --> 03:35:29.586]  Free shipping on orders above $99.
[03:35:29.586 --> 03:35:31.447]  Pepperspray of all kinds of strengths.
[03:35:31.447 --> 03:35:36.149]  Stun guns and tasers, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms, and a lot more.
[03:35:36.929 --> 03:35:43.414]  Okay, again, thanks to our sponsors, and also don't forget the online video bookstore at infowarriors.com.
[03:35:43.414 --> 03:35:48.178]  Going back, and I'm going to try to now just sit down and shut up and not ask questions and make points.
[03:35:48.178 --> 03:35:56.044]  We are joined by Adrian Salbucci, and sir, again, international consultant, economist, author.
[03:35:56.044 --> 03:35:59.447]  You've been predicting what would happen in Argentina years before it happened.
[03:35:59.447 --> 03:36:02.289]  You've been predicting what was going to happen here.
[03:36:02.289 --> 03:36:05.652]  Break down how they engineer this, what we're facing, and
[03:36:06.312 --> 03:36:17.795]  Any ways to bring these criminals to justice, or is it just a wonderland of Ponzi scheme criminals in control of our governments and military, and they're just going to continue to oppress until nothing's left?
[03:36:17.795 --> 03:36:20.115]  Well, let me say this.
[03:36:20.115 --> 03:36:22.076]  I fully agree with everything you've just said.
[03:36:22.076 --> 03:36:25.676]  It is a Ponzi, it's a global Ponzi scheme of criminals.
[03:36:25.676 --> 03:36:32.758]  They have huge amounts of power, but let's not forget that their power is based on our alleged weakness.
[03:36:33.498 --> 03:36:36.280]  And it's not so much that we are weak as individual citizens.
[03:36:36.280 --> 03:36:41.243]  Yourself in the United States, ourselves in Argentina, the audience that's listening to us now.
[03:36:41.243 --> 03:36:43.085]  But we are all very separated.
[03:36:43.085 --> 03:36:46.627]  And they ensure that we are all kept completely atomized.
[03:36:46.627 --> 03:36:48.388]  In other words, everybody doing their own thing.
[03:36:48.388 --> 03:36:57.394]  Because if you add the power of just one part of the critical mass of peoples in the various countries, we are far more powerful than they are.
[03:36:57.394 --> 03:36:58.115]  And they know it.
[03:36:58.115 --> 03:36:59.836]  That's why they permanently wield
[03:37:00.376 --> 03:37:12.320]  Psychological warfare and psychological action against us to make us believe, A, that they are more powerful than what they really are, and B, that we are far weaker than what we really are, because that is the secret, that's the capital one coming out of the bag.
[03:37:12.873 --> 03:37:16.877]  Now, as far as predicting, I don't think it's so much a question of predicting, Alex.
[03:37:16.877 --> 03:37:19.619]  It's a question of understanding how the model works.
[03:37:19.619 --> 03:37:32.591]  Once you know something about aerodynamics and turbines and a couple of other things, then the mystery of a flying airplane is no longer a mystery, because you understand the model, and if you understand the model, you can understand the internal trappings and how the whole thing works.
[03:37:33.157 --> 03:37:44.547]  So, for example, as far as Argentina is concerned, our collapse in 2001 and 2002 was brought about by a huge, enormous, unpayable public debt in U.S.
[03:37:44.547 --> 03:37:45.708]  dollars by the government.
[03:37:45.708 --> 03:37:47.950]  They couldn't pay it, and the whole country collapsed.
[03:37:47.950 --> 03:37:51.313]  However, you might ask, well, why did they do that?
[03:37:51.313 --> 03:37:59.720]  The reason they do that is exactly the same reason as to why Shylock lent 3,000 ducats to Antonio the Merchant of Venice.
[03:38:00.217 --> 03:38:03.480]  He told them, look, if you don't give me back the money, I want a pound of your flesh.
[03:38:03.480 --> 03:38:06.563]  And he couldn't give back the money, and he wanted a pound of flesh.
[03:38:06.563 --> 03:38:09.606]  And Antonio's friend said, I'll give you three times the debt.
[03:38:09.606 --> 03:38:14.390]  But the Shiloh, the miser, would say, no, I want my pound of flesh.
[03:38:14.390 --> 03:38:18.434]  In Argentina, the pound of flesh is called our national territory.
[03:38:18.434 --> 03:38:21.857]  They don't want us to pay the $300 billion we allegedly owe them.
[03:38:21.857 --> 03:38:25.640]  They want to have control over the country and control over the territory.
[03:38:25.640 --> 03:38:26.421]  So a debt
[03:38:27.046 --> 03:38:32.011]  Usually isn't it a good excuse for other things, just as for Antonio's pound the flesh.
[03:38:32.011 --> 03:38:38.458]  So what they did with that government, it was a very stupid government, they got the bankers to undead Argentina completely.
[03:38:38.458 --> 03:38:47.807]  They did this through well-paid and well-financed presidents and ministers of economy and so forth, and once the whole legal structure was set up,
[03:38:48.504 --> 03:38:53.147]  They made sure that we couldn't pay back, and since we couldn't pay back, they collapsed us.
[03:38:53.147 --> 03:38:56.929]  Well, I was about to say, the government, from reading the documents, wasn't stupid.
[03:38:56.929 --> 03:39:02.613]  They were bought and paid for to sell out your sovereignty, just like they've done to us.
[03:39:02.613 --> 03:39:04.914]  And, you know, you talk about how we have the power.
[03:39:04.914 --> 03:39:08.956]  There is an awakening to them, to the globalists, worldwide.
[03:39:08.956 --> 03:39:12.879]  So it's all coming to a head, what these scammers, what these shylocks,
[03:39:13.980 --> 03:39:14.560]  Exactly.
[03:39:14.560 --> 03:39:17.723]  So, you see, the point is, and you made a very valid point there,
[03:39:41.471 --> 03:40:02.163]  When you start understanding what these guys want to do, and perhaps one of the best ways to do it, I'll tell you, I use this example in Argentina, and people will understand, that is, look, think of the Kirchners, who are the president, the Christina Kirchner, who's the president of Argentina, or think of Obama, or even George W. Bush, any president, don't think of them as the president, think of them as your national CEO.
[03:40:02.731 --> 03:40:08.454]  So if Obama is your national CEO, that automatically triggers two key questions.
[03:40:08.454 --> 03:40:13.116]  If Obama is our CEO, who sits on the board of directors of the United States of America?
[03:40:13.116 --> 03:40:15.437]  And much more important, who are the shareholders?
[03:40:15.437 --> 03:40:17.578]  Who own the United States of America?
[03:40:17.578 --> 03:40:20.059]  Or Argentina, or Brazil, or any country you like.
[03:40:20.539 --> 03:40:35.765]  When you start understanding that, then you realize that what these guys do is they go into any country, yours or mine, they identify the SOBs, and believe me, there are millions of them, who are willing to sell out their country for money, for prestige, for fame, for power, for personal power.
[03:40:35.765 --> 03:40:41.728]  They pay them all they want, they pay all their campaigns, and then they have them as CEOs to do their own dirty work.
[03:40:41.728 --> 03:40:43.389]  They don't need invading forces.
[03:40:43.389 --> 03:40:46.290]  They don't need an invasion, as you've had to do in Iraq or
[03:40:46.850 --> 03:40:47.270]  Absolutely.
[03:40:47.270 --> 03:40:52.692]  And that's what globalism is, is these international bureaus of internationalists training the bureaucracy to go out and take over the nations of the planet through economic espionage.
[03:41:13.715 --> 03:41:20.881]  You know, there's a Washington Post journalist who wrote an article saying Argentina did not fall alone.
[03:41:20.881 --> 03:41:23.303]  Wall Street pushed to the very end.
[03:41:23.303 --> 03:41:35.132]  It was an article that appeared in the Washington Post in August 2003, which Mr. Bluestein later turned into a full-length book, and he gives full names, addresses, details of how Wall Street
[03:41:35.732 --> 03:41:50.755]  They literally produced a scam, they even incurred in gross professional misrepresentation, professional liability for badly performing as a bank, and they literally drove Argentina and those who invested in the Tango bonds to bankruptcy.
[03:41:50.755 --> 03:42:03.417]  And at the same time, right after our crisis, also in August of 2002, the New York Times ran a very interesting and shrewd article, which I think states it all, they said, will secession
[03:42:03.917 --> 03:42:17.494]  Be the key to Argentina's problems, and they wrote an article as to why the whole Patagonia, which are the five southern provinces of Argentina, should secede from the rest of the country, and on their own try and see if they could sort out their global problems.
[03:42:17.494 --> 03:42:22.761]  Because if they could split Argentina into two parts, it would be that much easier to control and take over.
[03:42:23.314 --> 03:42:40.292]  So as you can see, everything they do is part of a grand chessboard, and I'm not quoting Big New Brzezinski, but it definitely is part of a grand chessboard, and all that we need to do is understand the trappings, understand the mechanism, alert our countrymen, alert our folk, and as you said a little while back, Alex,
[03:42:41.152 --> 03:42:43.194]  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[03:42:43.194 --> 03:42:46.196]  Okay, we haven't really taken too many ounces of prevention.
[03:42:46.196 --> 03:42:48.057]  We're going to have to take a lot of pounds of cure.
[03:42:48.057 --> 03:42:49.398]  But we're still on time.
[03:42:49.398 --> 03:42:51.059]  We can still do something about it.
[03:42:51.059 --> 03:42:52.160]  We can still fight back.
[03:42:52.160 --> 03:42:57.664]  And the best way to do it is to do it with your wonderful program, where you're really explaining this to a lot of people.
[03:42:57.664 --> 03:43:05.750]  And we should even use the technology that they've made available to us, as you do with the Zeitgeist, the Obama deception movie, and a whole host of other things that you're doing all the time, Alex.
[03:43:06.826 --> 03:43:09.129]  Well, yeah, they put some of my stuff inside, guys.
[03:43:09.129 --> 03:43:11.332]  Now, expanding on this...
[03:43:13.283 --> 03:43:18.504]  Studying this, sir, as you've been doing for decades, what point is the United States at?
[03:43:18.504 --> 03:43:22.465]  How do you see them trying to bring us down and consolidate things?
[03:43:22.465 --> 03:43:33.287]  They're openly announcing they're going to implode the whole world, set up a new bank of the world that will set the carbon taxes, regulate every facet of our lives, have its own military to rule us.
[03:43:33.287 --> 03:43:40.449]  I mean, we're going from the bankers being behind the nations running things to openly putting crowns on their heads and saying, we own you.
[03:43:42.290 --> 03:43:54.939]  So speak to that, this new imperialism, this new colonialism, but openly by the polycentric bankers.
[03:43:54.939 --> 03:44:00.483]  Look, I think the key to this is to understand what they mean when they say New World Order.
[03:44:00.483 --> 03:44:04.786]  You know, New World Order doesn't mean that it's what they're going to do tomorrow.
[03:44:04.786 --> 03:44:06.968]  New World Order is a generic term.
[03:44:07.341 --> 03:44:18.918]  They used it in 1919, just when they founded the Council on Foreign Relations and the Royal Institute of International Affairs in Paris, after the Treaty of Versailles was imposed upon Germany and Austria-Hungary and the Turks.
[03:44:18.918 --> 03:44:21.302]  They talked about a new world order after World War I.
[03:44:22.072 --> 03:44:34.801]  When World War II was about to end and they got together in Bretton Woods and so forth, it was to form a new world order which was the Yalta schizophrenic world of the post-war Second World War with the USSR on one side and the USA on the other side.
[03:44:34.801 --> 03:44:39.063]  When they were getting ready for globalization, they knew that the USSR had to go.
[03:44:39.063 --> 03:44:44.107]  George Bush announced, we're going to have a George Bush Sr., we're going to have a new world order called globalization.
[03:44:44.107 --> 03:44:44.807]  Fine.
[03:44:44.807 --> 03:44:47.569]  Now they're talking about another new world order.
[03:44:47.569 --> 03:44:50.551]  And that new world order they're talking about now is world
[03:44:51.061 --> 03:44:51.642]  Government.
[03:44:51.642 --> 03:45:02.430]  It was announced on 8 December 2008 in the pages of the Financial Times London by one of their key journalists, Gideon Rachman, and the title of the article says it all.
[03:45:02.430 --> 03:45:05.212]  They just wrote, now it's for world government.
[03:45:05.212 --> 03:45:06.213]  We're going for world government.
[03:45:06.213 --> 03:45:12.438]  And the guy says, I'm not talking about governance, I'm not talking about international cooperation, I'm talking about world government.
[03:45:12.438 --> 03:45:15.220]  And that is the next stage that they want to drag us into.
[03:45:15.220 --> 03:45:17.482]  That's why it's so bloody dangerous what's happening right now.
[03:45:17.842 --> 03:45:33.998]  And then you find out that they are literal eugenicists who gave Hitler his own ideas, you find out they're total control freaks on a power trip, and that they've been working for a world government so they can literally carry out one-child policies, culling, you name it.
[03:45:33.998 --> 03:45:35.160]  I mean, folks,
[03:45:35.840 --> 03:45:37.501]  Are you upset about world government?
[03:45:37.501 --> 03:45:40.383]  They should really be upset if they know what the endgame is.
[03:45:40.383 --> 03:45:43.345]  From your research, sir, how are they planning to bring the U.S.
[03:45:43.345 --> 03:45:43.946]  down?
[03:45:43.946 --> 03:45:46.508]  How do you see these phases unfolding?
[03:45:46.508 --> 03:45:48.269]  And what is their endgame from your research?
[03:45:49.011 --> 03:45:55.557]  Well, the terrible thing, I think, unfortunately, is now, and I fully agree with you, Alex, it has a full name.
[03:45:55.557 --> 03:45:57.979]  It's Barack Hussein Obama.
[03:45:57.979 --> 03:46:08.008]  I mean, people should realize, how is it possible that somebody who was completely unknown four years ago was lifted from obscurity in Illinois to full Washington, D.C.
[03:46:08.008 --> 03:46:13.933]  pomp in just three years and is the President of the United States with an unlikely name of Barack Hussein Obama?
[03:46:14.708 --> 03:46:21.433]  Barack Hussein Obama is the CEO, and I think what we have to see is the people that they've placed around Mr. Obama.
[03:46:21.433 --> 03:46:23.895]  You have three types of people, basically.
[03:46:23.895 --> 03:46:31.461]  You have the CFR think tank people, you have the Clintonites, who are the people like Larry Summers, Timothy Geithner,
[03:46:31.941 --> 03:46:36.302]  Uh, Robert Rubin, even Paul Polker, who came a little bit from beforehand.
[03:46:36.302 --> 03:46:44.204]  You have them as the architects of the legal changes of the 90s that brought about this financial monstrosity.
[03:46:44.204 --> 03:46:46.484]  I mean, they actually are the architects of what happened then.
[03:46:46.484 --> 03:46:47.745]  They're back in power.
[03:46:47.745 --> 03:46:52.826]  So you have the Clintonites back in power, you have the CFR and Bilderberg and Trilateral Commission people back in power.
[03:46:53.186 --> 03:46:56.549]  And unfortunately, you also have the Zionists back in power.
[03:46:56.549 --> 03:47:00.513]  I mean, you have a chief of staff who has double Israeli-U.S.
[03:47:00.513 --> 03:47:10.483]  nationality, probably belongs to the intelligence service of the Israeli Defense Forces, and his father fought as a guerrilla terrorist in the Urgun Trial Elmi.
[03:47:10.483 --> 03:47:12.705]  I mean, you have very, very tough people there.
[03:47:12.705 --> 03:47:14.106]  You have David Axelrod.
[03:47:14.106 --> 03:47:16.649]  You have Hillary Clinton, who's an absolute Zionist.
[03:47:17.109 --> 03:47:29.772]  You have Joe Biden, who in a TV interview in Israel, in Shalom TV on 7th April 2007, he said literally, and you can watch this on YouTube, you don't have to be Jewish to be a Zionist, I'm a Zionist!
[03:47:30.325 --> 03:47:33.927]  So I figure, who's in power in the United States?
[03:47:33.927 --> 03:47:50.759]  Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer in their splendid book on the Israeli lobbies showed the way they exert so much power, they wield so much influence, that they end up forcing the United States to give priority to the Israeli national interest above the United States of America national interest.
[03:47:51.099 --> 03:47:55.083]  So you see, we have to be very careful with minorities that use our power.
[03:47:55.083 --> 03:47:58.307]  We have to be very careful with who the people are around Obama.
[03:47:58.307 --> 03:48:06.956]  And my feeling, and I see this from very far away in Argentina, is that Obama looks to me like the last president of the United States.
[03:48:06.956 --> 03:48:08.218]  You know, I agree with you.
[03:48:08.218 --> 03:48:09.259]  They want your downfall.
[03:48:09.861 --> 03:48:10.261]  No, no, no.
[03:48:10.261 --> 03:48:12.663]  Listen, I totally agree with you.
[03:48:12.663 --> 03:48:14.084]  This is the death of the Republic.
[03:48:14.084 --> 03:48:15.005]  He is the closer.
[03:48:15.005 --> 03:48:16.826]  That's what all the experts we keep talking to.
[03:48:16.826 --> 03:48:17.807]  He is the curtain.
[03:48:17.807 --> 03:48:25.552]  They'll still call us the U.S., but his job is to destroy everything the United States is and has stood for.
[03:48:25.552 --> 03:48:29.495]  We've been used as an engine to dominate and finance enslaving you and many others.
[03:48:29.935 --> 03:48:32.716]  But now, we're the Christmas pig.
[03:48:32.716 --> 03:48:38.397]  They are openly saying, they're slaughtering us, they're going to bring us down below Latin America.
[03:48:38.397 --> 03:48:41.717]  You take Argentina, you have the old saying, as rich as an Argentine.
[03:48:41.717 --> 03:48:46.498]  You go back a hundred years ago, people in Argentina, folks, were more wealthy than Americans on average.
[03:48:46.498 --> 03:48:50.459]  They were the richest country in Latin America, and the very same... I love that.
[03:48:50.459 --> 03:48:56.341]  Yeah, look now, look at Iceland, one of the most wealthy countries in the world, totally bankrupt overnight.
[03:48:56.341 --> 03:48:57.801]  This is what the bankers do.
[03:48:57.801 --> 03:48:58.241]  Go ahead.
[03:48:59.637 --> 03:49:09.610]  Yep, so I think that basically when we start having those ideas more or less clear in our minds and we realize what the purpose of Mr. Obama is, a key matter to keep in mind...
[03:49:10.439 --> 03:49:22.285]  Just as it was necessary to go from the bipolar world of mutually assured destruction and the Yalta Agreement, it was necessary to go to globalization, and one of the two big ones had to go.
[03:49:22.285 --> 03:49:29.268]  And they decided that the one that had to go was the United Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the USSR went almost without firing a shot.
[03:49:29.808 --> 03:49:34.431]  Now, to go from globalization to world government, they need for the United States to go.
[03:49:34.431 --> 03:49:56.763]  And to become, as you were just saying a few minutes ago, okay, you can still exist, but you are no longer a superpower, you are no longer the indispensable nation, as Madeleine Albright would like to say, you are no longer the primus inter partes, you're just another country, and you're going to be pauperized so that you look like Argentina, and like Brazil, and like Indonesia, and all these other countries that have been hit hard because it's their way of saying, we are in charge.
[03:49:57.412 --> 03:50:05.799]  Now, mind you, I personally, this is perhaps more from a philosophical point of view, I think they're going to fail, because what they want is absolute madness.
[03:50:05.799 --> 03:50:11.564]  What I do fear, Alex, and I feel this very much, is these people will not take defeat for an answer.
[03:50:11.564 --> 03:50:19.411]  In other words, it's not a question of saying, oh, we're going to defeat them, and they're going to go running away with a tail between their little paws, and they're just going to run away.
[03:50:19.989 --> 03:50:26.194]  I think these guys, if they are faced with total defeat, might just trigger a full-fledged war and say, well, what the hell?
[03:50:26.194 --> 03:50:28.656]  If we can't have the world, nobody can have the world.
[03:50:28.656 --> 03:50:30.697]  Well, no, that's what Rand Corporation says.
[03:50:30.697 --> 03:50:35.021]  They want to start World War III, not just worldwide economic collapse, to do this.
[03:50:35.021 --> 03:50:36.382]  Let's talk about that in the final segment.
[03:50:36.382 --> 03:50:37.162]  We've got to have you back.
[03:50:38.323 --> 03:50:43.227]  Adrian Salbucci, best-selling author, researcher, lecturer, economist.
[03:50:43.227 --> 03:50:46.349]  It's asalbucci.com.ar.
[03:50:46.349 --> 03:50:51.073]  And we'll get that up on screen for folks at prisonplanet.tv as we simulcast.
[03:50:51.073 --> 03:50:55.977]  You got all these special interests that run Obama, run Bush, like they're errand boys.
[03:50:55.977 --> 03:50:58.679]  And they are stealing everything you've got.
[03:50:58.679 --> 03:51:01.000]  Your whole future's gone unless you say no.
[03:51:03.257 --> 03:51:05.118]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:51:05.118 --> 03:51:09.939]  You might not be able to spell Constitution, but you sure know how important it is.
[03:51:09.939 --> 03:51:16.081]  You might not be missing any shirts from your closet, but you have given the shirt off your back hundreds of times.
[03:51:16.081 --> 03:51:21.383]  You might not understand the thousands of laws that exist, but you do live by the Ten Commandments.
[03:51:21.383 --> 03:51:27.685]  You might not know who the bad guys are, or what you should be complaining about, but you do know what to be thankful for.
[03:51:27.685 --> 03:51:31.946]  You might not be looking for a government handout, but you do know how to lend a helping hand.
[03:51:32.486 --> 03:51:34.227]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:51:34.227 --> 03:51:39.732]  There might be a lot that you don't know, but you do know that you want to take care of your family.

[03:52:02.771 --> 03:52:08.007]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.815 --> 03:52:14.680]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.680 --> 03:52:21.184]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.184 --> 03:52:23.166]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.166 --> 03:52:25.628]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.628 --> 03:52:36.496]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.797 --> 03:52:40.458]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.458 --> 03:52:42.319]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:42.319 --> 03:52:49.243]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.243 --> 03:52:57.487]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.487 --> 03:52:59.068]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:59.068 --> 03:53:00.249]  The people strike back.
[03:53:02.156 --> 03:53:03.057]  Attention, gardeners!
[03:53:03.057 --> 03:53:05.658]  This is an urgent GCN Self-Reliance Update.
[03:53:05.658 --> 03:53:10.201]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[03:53:10.201 --> 03:53:18.406]  It's called Proto-Grow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[03:53:18.406 --> 03:53:21.228]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[03:53:21.553 --> 03:53:21.893]  I think so.
[03:53:40.913 --> 03:53:44.336]  If you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[03:53:44.336 --> 03:53:47.938]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[03:53:47.938 --> 03:53:53.002]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[03:53:53.002 --> 03:53:55.924]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[03:53:55.924 --> 03:53:56.104]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:54:02.149 --> 03:54:09.833]  I'm going to have to have our guests back up for an hour and a half or something the next few weeks to take your calls.
[03:54:09.833 --> 03:54:12.094]  Amazing research, amazing foresight.
[03:54:12.094 --> 03:54:16.075]  I'm going to go over some of his books and articles he wrote 15 plus years ago.
[03:54:16.075 --> 03:54:16.936]  Breaking all this down.
[03:54:16.936 --> 03:54:19.257]  And there's pages for people to know about the New World Order everywhere.
[03:54:19.257 --> 03:54:23.479]  Avian flu found on Western Kentucky poultry farm.
[03:54:25.663 --> 03:54:31.746]  Politics, environment, reporting that Mexico, Singapore halt poultry imports from Kentucky.
[03:54:31.746 --> 03:54:36.348]  Folks, the globalists could try a bird flu, nukes going off at cities, anything.
[03:54:36.348 --> 03:54:39.230]  They're in power because they're ruthless.
[03:54:39.230 --> 03:54:41.911]  And so we'll discuss that in closing with our guest in one moment.
[03:54:41.911 --> 03:54:44.753]  One more sponsor I want to let you know about that makes this show possible.
[03:54:44.753 --> 03:54:45.273]  Homegain.
[03:54:45.273 --> 03:54:49.015]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, homegain.com.
[03:54:49.015 --> 03:54:52.236]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[03:54:52.236 --> 03:54:54.858]  And you can find a great realtor, get the
[03:54:56.049 --> 03:54:56.870]  I think so.
[03:55:13.789 --> 03:55:16.371]  Uh, improvements are to increase the value of your home.
[03:55:16.371 --> 03:55:19.452]  For over 10 years, these folks have been helping sellers and buyers.
[03:55:19.452 --> 03:55:24.215]  Visit their link at InfoWars.com by clicking on Mac's little orange home game gorilla.
[03:55:24.215 --> 03:55:26.937]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[03:55:26.937 --> 03:55:27.877]  Check them out today.
[03:55:27.877 --> 03:55:28.698]  Okay, going back...
[03:55:29.636 --> 03:55:35.339]  To Adrian Salbucci, and we want to again put his website up on screen for folks.
[03:55:35.339 --> 03:55:41.122]  It's www.asalbuchi.com.ar.
[03:55:41.122 --> 03:55:43.543]  We've got it up on screen for folks there.
[03:55:43.543 --> 03:55:46.725]  In the last three or four minutes we have left, you're absolutely right.
[03:55:46.725 --> 03:55:50.186]  From my research, they've said they will do anything.
[03:55:50.186 --> 03:55:52.568]  They'll release mass plagues so they can pose as savior.
[03:55:53.729 --> 03:55:54.970]  And then offer the solution.
[03:55:54.970 --> 03:55:57.614]  They'll detonate nukes.
[03:55:57.614 --> 03:56:00.257]  They'll attack other countries.
[03:56:00.257 --> 03:56:07.967]  I guess the main thing is discredit them, expose them, have grand juries, indict the bankers like Madoff, start arresting these people.
[03:56:07.967 --> 03:56:10.390]  And like you said, they're still going to attack us.
[03:56:10.390 --> 03:56:10.951]  I mean, what do we do?
[03:56:12.025 --> 03:56:19.670]  But I think, Alex, the best thing we can do is stick together and start at least pointing ever stronger fingers at them.
[03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:24.053]  You were just saying that the avian flu and all these other scams that they prepare.
[03:56:24.053 --> 03:56:31.097]  I'd just like to, in closing, read you a very brief news article that I'm sure you already know, but I think it's worth keeping in mind.
[03:56:31.690 --> 03:56:44.923]  On, according to ABC News, on 20th October 2008, during a Seattle fundraiser, Joe Biden, who's the real power behind Obama, I mean, your president is much more Joe Biden than Barack Obama said.
[03:56:45.578 --> 03:56:52.222]  Mark my words, I'm quoting, it will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy.
[03:56:52.222 --> 03:56:53.362]  The world is looking.
[03:56:53.362 --> 03:56:57.585]  We're about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old president of the United States.
[03:56:57.585 --> 03:56:59.646]  Remember I said it standing here.
[03:56:59.646 --> 03:57:02.828]  If you don't remember anything else I said, remember this.
[03:57:02.828 --> 03:57:03.168]  Watch.
[03:57:03.593 --> 03:57:09.418]  We're going to have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy.
[03:57:09.418 --> 03:57:14.823]  Now, he didn't know that he was being taped, and then when he realized that he was being taped, he said, oh, I shouldn't have said that.
[03:57:14.823 --> 03:57:18.726]  But it's more than obvious that Joe Biden is really in the know.
[03:57:18.726 --> 03:57:20.888]  He must know that something is being prepared.
[03:57:20.888 --> 03:57:28.475]  He must know that a false flag event is going to arise somewhere, maybe in the States, maybe abroad, maybe American interests elsewhere.
[03:57:28.855 --> 03:57:34.359]  But something that will bring the people together fanatically, they hope, like 9-11 did.
[03:57:34.359 --> 03:57:39.663]  And that's going to be the excuse to put chips under your arm, take your property away, take your guns away.
[03:57:39.663 --> 03:57:46.728]  So we have to be very careful and very shrewd and very alert not to let these guys bullshit their way to world government.
[03:57:48.513 --> 03:57:55.256]  Alright, well I hear you and people are really starting to get concerned, Mr. Salboci.
[03:57:55.256 --> 03:57:59.638]  And like you said, it's the big oil, defense contractors, foreign lobbies.
[03:57:59.638 --> 03:58:04.740]  This country, the whole world is being taken down just like your nation was and we've got to stand together against it.
[03:58:04.740 --> 03:58:08.062]  We'll talk to you again in the near future if you can come on with us.
[03:58:08.062 --> 03:58:10.303]  We appreciate you joining us.
[03:58:10.303 --> 03:58:13.964]  Just let me know when and I'm there to help and thanks a lot for this interview.
[03:58:15.285 --> 03:58:15.845]  Thank you.
[03:58:15.845 --> 03:58:16.465]  Thanks for coming on.
[03:58:16.465 --> 03:58:20.207]  We'll get you on with Jason Burmans who comes on 9 to midnight on the Infowarrior in the next few weeks.
[03:58:20.207 --> 03:58:22.027]  We'll have you back here to take phone calls.
[03:58:22.027 --> 03:58:22.548]  Take care, sir.
[03:58:43.806 --> 03:58:46.407]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.969 --> 03:58:52.589]  Hello, friends.
[03:58:52.589 --> 03:58:53.669]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.669 --> 03:58:58.391]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.391 --> 03:59:01.372]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.372 --> 03:59:04.413]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.413 --> 03:59:10.255]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.495 --> 03:59:13.719]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
