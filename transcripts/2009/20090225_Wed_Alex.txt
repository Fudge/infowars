[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:00.729]  Big Brother.
[00:00:29.807 --> 00:00:32.689]  mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.150]  You want answers?
[00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:35.832]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:40.135]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:40.675 --> 00:00:44.758]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.124]  Senator Randy Brogdon of Oklahoma is our guest.
[00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:55.026]  He is
[00:00:56.573 --> 00:01:05.901]  Introduced mirror legislation to the House version that Representative Charles Key and others have gotten to pass the House.
[00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:08.644]  And people keep saying, can this work?
[00:01:08.684 --> 00:01:09.284]  Will this work?
[00:01:09.344 --> 00:01:10.325]  It's the only hope we've got.
[00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:17.031]  People are like, oh, Congressman Keys, Representative Keys, he can't get anything passed.
[00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:18.793]  They'll never get it through the Senate.
[00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:20.835]  Well, it's got a very good chance of passing the Senate.
[00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.631]  Other states are passing this.
[00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.332]  We got Texas to introduce two different resolutions in the last week.
[00:01:27.452 --> 00:01:30.254]  Your calls... I talked to the Rep's office and had them on.
[00:01:30.614 --> 00:01:32.055]  Your calls spurred this.
[00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:33.775]  You're doing it!
[00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.517]  And we just re-educate the public.
[00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:40.999]  I guess they've never even been educated, so we can just educate them.
[00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:56.397]  But we have to educate the public on the fact that the states created the federal government, the federal government's out of control, bought and paid for by foreign banks, letting foreign corporations come in, buy off the feds, buy off the state legislatures, take over our roads, our infrastructure.
[00:01:56.437 --> 00:01:57.458]  That's what privatization is.
[00:01:57.518 --> 00:01:58.499]  It's not real privatization.
[00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:05.584]  And so here's the headline, Oklahoma House passes sovereignty bill, passed it for other states seeking to re-insert constitutional rights.
[00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:07.345]  And see, people love a winner.
[00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:20.471]  As other states pass this, and some states have completely passed it, and the strong language in these bills about no to gun confiscation, no to FEMA camps, no to handing our roads over to foreign corporations, no to handing our ports over, no to the banks taking over,
[00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:23.535]  I mean, it's happening.
[00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:24.316]  It's happening.
[00:02:24.356 --> 00:02:30.701]  We have to have the states as the leaders, as our representatives, take on the feds, who we created, through the states.
[00:02:32.643 --> 00:02:38.128]  So I'm just very, very excited about this and I appreciate him joining us, Senator Randy Brogdon.
[00:02:38.388 --> 00:02:39.729]  Sir, thank you for what you're doing.
[00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:48.858]  Tell us exactly what's going on and how the listeners can help get this passed in the Oklahoma Senate so it's fully in place for the state of Oklahoma.
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:03:05.810]  Well, I appreciate you having me on, and I'm always excited when I have an opportunity to spread the good word of freedom and liberty and sovereignty, and I have been welcomed in the state of Texas many times over the last several months talking on sovereignty and freedom issues.
[00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:17.578]  As a matter of fact, I think I've been down there about nine times in different parts of the state discussing issues just like this, and the NAFTA Superhighway, the TTC 35, sovereignty, freedom, the Tenth Amendment.
[00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.474]  Let me tell you what we're doing here in the state of Oklahoma.
[00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:28.540]  We, as a legislative body, have decided that we are going to reclaim our state's rights, and you hit the nail on the head.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.484]  There would not be a federal government had the states collectively not created the federal government.
[00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:41.468]  The federal government, Congress, has forgotten about that, and most state legislatures around this nation have forgotten about it.
[00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.353]  But you know, true, we are part of the United States system.
[00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:58.336]  But just because we are a part of the United States does not mean that as a state or as a people we are subjects to the to the federal government.
[00:03:58.376 --> 00:03:59.776]  That is not what it's all about.
[00:04:00.336 --> 00:04:09.559]  Congress has very limited rights, enumerated powers that we the people have given Congress the responsibility to do.
[00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:17.802]  Today Congress is the biggest, this Congress is the biggest bunch of overreachers and underachievers I have ever seen in my entire life.
[00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:18.582]  It is
[00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:25.450]  What this Congress is involved with is devastating to us as a nation.
[00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.212]  It is devastating to us as a free people.
[00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:46.545]  If I could just add and get your take on the President's, not State of the Union, address to Congress, a ten minute standing ovation as everything is collapsing and falling apart, Obama bad-mouthing the states and saying, we're going to make sure you don't waste the money when they take our state money and then send it back with strings attached, a tiny portion,
[00:04:47.345 --> 00:04:50.588]  And Obama's the guy who helped engineer the banker bailout.
[00:04:50.968 --> 00:04:58.433]  The very people that changed the laws in the 90s are now running his administration that set all this up, and they're just so proud of themselves.
[00:04:58.873 --> 00:05:01.615]  They're just so... I mean, you know, both the Republicans and the Democrats.
[00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.597]  It was a sickening spectacle.
[00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:04.958]  Your take on that, State Senator?
[00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:16.066]  Well, it was probably one of the most sophomoric speeches I've ever heard in my life, if you compare it to the Constitution, if you compare it to the founders of this great nation.
[00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:19.699]  And we, I watched as much of it as I could.
[00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:27.842]  And I saw Republicans standing and cheering, talking about putting limits on how much private industry can make.
[00:05:28.422 --> 00:05:35.484]  And so our Republicans in Congress have so, uh, fallen off the wagon or they, they've drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:05:35.644 --> 00:05:40.306]  I don't know what goes on in Washington, but here's what I am convinced of.
[00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:42.747]  I've been serving in the state Senate for the last six years.
[00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:46.188]  I am convinced without any shadow of a doubt,
[00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:51.102]  We can take our nation back, but it will be done at the state level.
[00:05:51.522 --> 00:05:53.664]  State by state by state.
[00:05:54.084 --> 00:05:55.486]  We must regain our sovereignty.
[00:05:55.546 --> 00:06:01.651]  We must re-implement the freedom and the liberty that our founding fathers gave us.
[00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:09.137]  And our 10th Amendment resolution, SJR 10 and House Bill 1003, uses some pretty strong words.
[00:06:09.638 --> 00:06:14.482]  We are ordering the federal government to cease and desist effective immediately.
[00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:20.351]  Of all mandates that are beyond the scope of their constitutionally delegated powers.
[00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:33.256]  And I dare say 90% plus of what Congress is involved with today falls outside of their constitutional authority and the enumerated powers that we, the people, gave them.
[00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:37.638]  And I'm telling you what, I'm on a charge here in the state of Oklahoma to take them back.
[00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:39.512]  Well, we're with you.
[00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.835]  We're right behind you and right beside you, Senator.
[00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:46.160]  Very excited and just really love your spirit and the things you're talking about.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:56.292]  And if you do compare the federal government today to the Founding Fathers, how eloquent, intelligent, their grasp of history, what they were doing, and you compare it to what's going on now,
[00:06:57.473 --> 00:07:02.054]  I mean, number one, they're only going to regulate and control regular businesses and small companies.
[00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:18.818]  If you read his $500,000 cap, which is total government control, total tyranny, communist and fascist do it, it's waivers for all the big banks and all his cronies, and it says they will selectively enforce who they put caps on.
[00:07:18.878 --> 00:07:25.040]  So it's even worse than just having the government put a cap, because, I mean, this is incredible.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.460]  Talk about social engineering.
[00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:38.307]  Well, President Obama has no moral authority to stand and lecture the citizens here in the state of Oklahoma or the state of Texas on how to be fiscally responsible.
[00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:46.489]  We have just witnessed something in the first 30 days of his administration with a very socialistic agenda.
[00:07:46.609 --> 00:07:52.830]  I mean, it borders on fascism to where government and industry are now going to partner up
[00:07:53.647 --> 00:07:56.149]  And it will be devastating to the free markets.
[00:07:56.729 --> 00:08:00.252]  It will collapse our country as we know it.
[00:08:00.552 --> 00:08:06.436]  But I'm telling you what, we can change it because the state of Oklahoma, we're not going to participate in his nonsense.
[00:08:06.496 --> 00:08:10.878]  I'm not, we're not going to participate in his debt or his mandates.
[00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:13.000]  We're going to, this is my goal.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.942]  I don't suspect we have a governor that's going to be very helpful in that right now.
[00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:20.705]  So, but you know, the legislature,
[00:08:21.406 --> 00:08:27.479]  Is making a very strong statement that we're reclaiming our rights and we're going to order the government to get out of our pocket and out of our backyard.
[00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:28.160]  Leave us alone.
[00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:32.489]  Take care of the responsibilities that we've given them and nothing more, nothing less.
[00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:35.928]  Well, this is elite corporations.
[00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:41.752]  They're on record using the presidency and the executive and the legislative to hijack industry.
[00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:42.753]  I mean, they love this.
[00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:53.640]  I've got Financial Times of London articles where they admit the big super banks are just using this to buy up banks and other businesses, and now they're talking about nationalizing other things like oil and industry and auto making.
[00:08:55.121 --> 00:09:00.145]  I mean, that's great for the few CEOs that are in the Obama administration, and that's why the Republicans
[00:09:01.226 --> 00:09:04.447]  We're playing along, because they want, you know, part of that honeypot, too.
[00:09:04.468 --> 00:09:12.311]  I mean, I think this is the greatest challenge this nation has ever faced, because as our forebearers said, this country could not fall from without, it will only fall from within.
[00:09:13.312 --> 00:09:23.156]  Well, that's exactly right, and there's one thing that will restore this nation, and it is to what I like to refer to, back to the future.
[00:09:23.716 --> 00:09:26.958]  If we're going to have a future in this nation, we're going to have to go back to our founding roots.
[00:09:28.155 --> 00:09:37.263]  Uh, start living by the principles that the Declaration of Independence so clearly spelled out and, uh, protected in the rule of law with our Constitution.
[00:09:37.703 --> 00:09:45.470]  You know, Obama has been talking down this, this nation ever since he, uh, talking down the economy ever since he has come into office.
[00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:50.514]  It was, it's quite different, uh, message what he was, uh, sharing out on the campaign trail.
[00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:52.676]  You know, he did inspire a lot of people.
[00:09:53.348 --> 00:10:00.774]  And, of course, his socialistic agenda, I hope, fails and fails miserably, but it looks like it's going to be a stark reality here before too long.
[00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.095]  Well, Senator, you're right.
[00:10:02.115 --> 00:10:06.399]  I mean, you're right when you say he was, hope, change, we'll fix it right away, it's not that bad.
[00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:11.844]  And as soon as he came in, he said, you do exactly what I say, or a crisis will be a catastrophe.
[00:10:12.124 --> 00:10:13.705]  That is economic terrorism.
[00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:15.066]  That's exactly right.
[00:10:15.206 --> 00:10:18.829]  And what we have seen this week, the Bank of America stock fell 36 percent.
[00:10:20.803 --> 00:10:27.665]  Christopher Dodd gets up and does his little whiny boy talk, and we have Republicans falling in lockstep with him.
[00:10:28.825 --> 00:10:38.648]  And the monetary system has obviously been in trouble ever since we adopted the Federal Reserve System, but Citigroup this week fell 22%.
[00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:40.889]  I mean, they're almost a penny stock now.
[00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.449]  Well, guess who that's going to benefit?
[00:10:43.469 --> 00:10:46.370]  It's going to benefit the big players, it's going to benefit
[00:10:46.894 --> 00:10:50.455]  The federal government, they own now, I think, 40% of the stock.
[00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:52.455]  This is what they're wanting to do.
[00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:58.437]  The federal government is going to own up to 40% of the financial stocks in this country.
[00:10:59.337 --> 00:11:08.839]  You cannot become more of a fascist state than when the federal government takes over our banking institutions.
[00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:13.480]  I mean, it is just a bizarre situation we have found ourselves in.
[00:11:13.885 --> 00:11:34.292]  Well, Senator, studying this, what's really happening is, under the Banker Bailout Bill, it gave omnipotent power to the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, and if you look at it, it's really the Federal Reserve and offshore banks, through the glove, or the apparatus of government, that are taking government control, just like big banks do third world countries.
[00:11:34.332 --> 00:11:35.413]  I want to get your take on that.
[00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:36.413]  I know you're a very busy man.
[00:11:36.673 --> 00:11:37.493]  We've got a quick break.
[00:11:37.513 --> 00:11:58.545]  Can we come back and get your take on that, and then give out the bill number and tell listeners all over the country, because this will be a domino effect, how they can let their voices be heard, but also we have a few affiliates in Oklahoma, how folks can call and make sure this happens, and also call the media and tell them, don't you badmouth this state senator and others, and Charles Key and others.
[00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:02.668]  You don't have any future, economically fools, unless this happens.
[00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.731]  I mean, look, America is 300 million people.
[00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:06.872]  They're 6.5 billion.
[00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.073]  Why do most of them live as slaves?
[00:12:08.413 --> 00:12:10.054]  They let corruption take over.
[00:12:11.215 --> 00:12:11.956]  Look at Mexico.
[00:12:11.976 --> 00:12:13.497]  They've got triple the resources we have.
[00:12:13.517 --> 00:12:15.399]  They're collapsing because of corruption.
[00:12:15.499 --> 00:12:18.481]  Free market and liberty is what made this country so great.
[00:12:19.002 --> 00:12:20.723]  And they're killing the goose that lays the golden egg.
[00:12:20.743 --> 00:12:21.364]  Stay there, Senator.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.482]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:12:27.063 --> 00:12:30.025]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:12:30.385 --> 00:12:33.808]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:12:34.169 --> 00:12:40.354]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:12:40.754 --> 00:12:45.798]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:12:45.978 --> 00:12:52.684]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:12:52.984 --> 00:12:53.864]  Need something more?
[00:12:54.084 --> 00:12:57.726]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.

[00:13:23.976 --> 00:13:31.202]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest priced, highest quality, storable food for over a decade.
[00:13:31.342 --> 00:13:35.546]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds 4 to 5 people is only $39.95.
[00:13:35.626 --> 00:13:37.367]  That's right.
[00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:40.590]  A one-year supply that feeds 4 to 5 people for under $4,000.
[00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.010]  That's only $92.99.
[00:13:44.428 --> 00:13:44.968]  We're good to go.
[00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.930]  I think so.
[00:14:23.673 --> 00:14:30.035]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:32.396]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:14:33.057 --> 00:14:34.097]  But who is the enemy?
[00:14:34.617 --> 00:14:35.117]  Bin Laden.
[00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:36.318]  This is his M.O.
[00:14:36.358 --> 00:14:37.718]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:14:37.758 --> 00:14:39.479]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:46.521]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:14:46.922 --> 00:14:47.362]  Some U.S.
[00:14:47.402 --> 00:14:53.044]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:14:53.744 --> 00:14:57.267]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:14:57.287 --> 00:15:00.049]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:25.040]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.681]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:29.203]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:15:29.643 --> 00:15:34.406]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:15:34.786 --> 00:15:37.628]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.422]  Oklahoma State Senator Randy Brogdon is our guest for five more minutes.
[00:16:36.504 --> 00:16:43.729]  Sir, that question I asked before the break, I've analyzed this, I've had many economists on, I want to see if you would concur.
[00:16:44.529 --> 00:16:47.951]  Nationalization's bad enough, but the Federal Reserve is private.
[00:16:48.031 --> 00:16:55.596]  It's really taking control and vertically integrating their competition, so they put the debt on us, but then they keep the profits.
[00:16:55.636 --> 00:16:56.517]  Can you comment on that?
[00:16:57.011 --> 00:17:05.433]  You bet, and the Federal Reserve, it was probably one of the blackest marks of anything that has ever transpired in our nation's history.
[00:17:05.473 --> 00:17:11.234]  Most people have no understanding that the Federal Reserve is a private group of financiers.
[00:17:11.714 --> 00:17:13.594]  They literally run the dollar.
[00:17:13.654 --> 00:17:15.435]  They run our monetary system.
[00:17:15.935 --> 00:17:18.936]  That is not the way our Founding Fathers set it up.
[00:17:19.016 --> 00:17:26.097]  As a matter of fact, there are many debates and articles written, even in the Federalist Papers, talking about
[00:17:27.604 --> 00:17:32.247]  Never having a central monetary or a central bank.
[00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:37.191]  It is the responsibility of the federal government to coin money.
[00:17:37.271 --> 00:17:52.243]  And once again, the lackadaisical, unconstitutional, nerdy whales in Congress, they relinquished that responsibility, handed it over, and now we have a black market of paper money that can be printed at will.
[00:17:52.823 --> 00:17:54.985]  Our inflation rate is so high today,
[00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:56.850]  People have no idea.
[00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.312]  I mean, the Feds tell us our inflation rate is 3 or 4 percent, whatever it is.
[00:18:00.873 --> 00:18:06.156]  I would dare say our inflation rate today is probably up around 14 to 15 percent.
[00:18:06.216 --> 00:18:07.597]  Well, you've done your research.
[00:18:08.058 --> 00:18:10.599]  That's what all the economists we talk to say, and it's going to go over 20.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.964]  For those that don't know, the foreign offshore banks are collapsing the economy so they can have a fire sale.
[00:18:17.484 --> 00:18:18.205]  That's exactly right.
[00:18:18.245 --> 00:18:22.928]  I mean, they did this and they need to be arrested instead of grandstanding as our saviors.
[00:18:23.447 --> 00:18:28.612]  Well, and I mentioned before the break, Bank of America stock fell 36% this week.
[00:18:28.992 --> 00:18:29.653]  Citigroup fell 22%.
[00:18:31.114 --> 00:18:36.159]  Well, there's only a few people in this world that have an opportunity to go out and buy that stock at this fire sale.
[00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:40.563]  And some of that money can, I bet you a dollar to a donut, will come from China.
[00:18:40.603 --> 00:18:41.984]  So we're in trouble.
[00:18:42.044 --> 00:18:43.746]  We still have opportunities.
[00:18:44.146 --> 00:18:46.148]  And I want to invite people to go to my website.
[00:18:46.248 --> 00:18:48.250]  It's just my name, randybrogdon.com.
[00:18:48.817 --> 00:18:51.921]  I have written extensively about a lot of these issues that we're discussing.
[00:18:51.981 --> 00:19:06.799]  A lot of our legislation is up on the website, and I talk about freedom and liberty and sovereignty, and I have links to a lot of different publications, and so I would invite your listeners to go and learn more about what we're trying to do here in Oklahoma.
[00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:14.799]  We've got your, we're also simulcasting on TV right now, Senator Randy Brogdon's website is randybrogdon.com.
[00:19:14.839 --> 00:19:18.423]  Go there, they have the bills, they have phone numbers, they have contacts, they have articles.
[00:19:19.064 --> 00:19:21.507]  He's written, it's an excellent website.
[00:19:21.887 --> 00:19:25.331]  Senator, I know you've got to go into the Senate here in about three minutes.
[00:19:25.692 --> 00:19:26.993]  Tell us how we put pressure
[00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:30.475]  Especially our Oklahoma listeners, but folks around the country.
[00:19:31.235 --> 00:19:33.936]  On the Senate, because you told me they might try some chicanery.
[00:19:34.317 --> 00:19:38.758]  The state police have been trying to come in under the federal auspices and try to block things.
[00:19:39.238 --> 00:19:41.539]  That's what Representative Key told us.
[00:19:41.719 --> 00:19:41.959]  Right.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.041]  So in the two or three minutes we've got left, tell us what we need to do.
[00:19:45.521 --> 00:19:49.422]  Well, I think that we're going to get a hearing on this bill this time.
[00:19:49.462 --> 00:19:53.044]  Last year, Representative Key had his bill passed off of the House floor 97-3.
[00:19:54.910 --> 00:20:00.171]  And the Democrat floor leader at the time would not allow me to have a hearing on the Senate floor.
[00:20:00.652 --> 00:20:01.432]  That was the bad news.
[00:20:01.452 --> 00:20:10.974]  The good news this year, for the first time in our state's history, the Republicans took control of the Senate, the first time since statehood.
[00:20:11.054 --> 00:20:18.236]  So we have a 26 to 22 majority in the Senate, and my bill has already passed.
[00:20:18.943 --> 00:20:21.204]  Overwhelmingly in Judiciary Committee.
[00:20:21.564 --> 00:20:24.966]  It'll be headed to the floor probably Thursday or maybe Monday or Tuesday.
[00:20:24.986 --> 00:20:25.847]  I haven't decided yet.
[00:20:26.567 --> 00:20:28.388]  And I suspect it's going to pass.
[00:20:28.508 --> 00:20:33.711]  And here again, we have two bills alive today here in one House bill and one Senate bill.
[00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:41.935]  Eventually, I'm going to yield to Representative Keyes' bill because he ran the bill last year and I was his Senate author.
[00:20:41.995 --> 00:20:47.238]  So we're trying to keep both bills alive just in case there are some shenanigans that take place.
[00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:56.053]  And make sure that we give the citizens of Oklahoma an opportunity to head down the path of reclaiming our sovereignty as a state.
[00:20:56.073 --> 00:20:58.514]  And I'm telling you what, I am encouraged.
[00:20:59.775 --> 00:21:06.057]  What's happening here in Oklahoma, my assistant came in just a while ago and she said, I've already had a call from a listener in California.
[00:21:06.097 --> 00:21:13.480]  So your message, this message of freedom and sovereignty is obviously making an impact as we speak.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.481]  Yes, Senator, in closing,
[00:21:16.499 --> 00:21:24.442]  You know, if we had real Republicans like you have in Oklahoma, and like they have in New Hampshire, we've been interviewing people from all these states.
[00:21:24.722 --> 00:21:26.523]  New Hampshire's got a great resolution.
[00:21:26.923 --> 00:21:28.604]  Yeah, I mean, you guys are really informed.
[00:21:29.004 --> 00:21:32.606]  You're the leaders we need, just like Dr. Paul and others.
[00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:34.967]  And folks, we need to get behind these men and women.
[00:21:35.567 --> 00:21:39.228]  We are the people that will put wind into the sails of the ship of liberty.
[00:21:39.248 --> 00:21:42.890]  And so I just hope you go to the website, randybrogdon.com.
[00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.271]  Brogdon is spelled B-R-O-G-D-O-N.
[00:21:46.131 --> 00:21:48.372]  B-R-O-G-D-O-N.
[00:21:48.452 --> 00:21:53.715]  And sir, when it passes, we're praying it does, I want to have you back on, sir.
[00:21:53.735 --> 00:21:54.135]  You bet.
[00:21:54.295 --> 00:21:55.055]  Thank you so much.
[00:21:55.395 --> 00:21:56.116]  Thanks for the invite.
[00:21:56.856 --> 00:21:57.076]  You bet.
[00:21:57.096 --> 00:21:58.157]  We'll talk to you soon, Senator.
[00:21:59.557 --> 00:22:00.257]  All right, there he goes.
[00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:02.418]  We're going to come back, take phone calls, do a news blitz.
[00:22:02.458 --> 00:22:06.380]  I have some video clips I'm going to be playing as well, some key information.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.441]  So please stay with us.
[00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:11.683]  The website's at PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net, and JonesReport.com.
[00:22:11.703 --> 00:22:12.163]  Stay with us.
[00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:16.980]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.681]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:25.523 --> 00:22:27.503]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:22:28.104 --> 00:22:30.604]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:22:31.185 --> 00:22:35.326]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:22:36.095 --> 00:22:37.856]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:22:38.216 --> 00:22:41.238]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:22:41.618 --> 00:22:44.620]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:56.307]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.

[00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:05.913]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[00:23:31.647 --> 00:23:32.688]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:39.338]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:39.958 --> 00:23:48.470]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:23:48.837 --> 00:23:55.639]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:55.939 --> 00:23:59.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.302]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:24:04.882 --> 00:24:07.503]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:24:46.758 --> 00:24:49.160]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.582]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:24:51.622 --> 00:24:52.082]  this fall?

[00:25:42.977 --> 00:25:44.138]  That's Jimmy Vaughn.
[00:25:45.178 --> 00:25:46.579]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:48.440]  The song, No Shackles On Me.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.681]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:52.902]  I sit down with Big Brother.
[00:25:54.482 --> 00:25:57.284]  I sit down with Big Brother.
[00:25:57.724 --> 00:25:58.684]  Don't like those RFIDs.
[00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:07.503]  Yeah, I got the blues about my freedom.
[00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:16.265]  Jimmy and his lovely wife Robin invited my wife and I to go have dinner with Ron Paul this weekend, and much I'd love to do it.
[00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:17.305]  Thanks for inviting me, Jimmy.
[00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:23.326]  I can't because I'm going to be here Saturday night finishing the Obama deception.
[00:26:24.186 --> 00:26:27.467]  Because I do have the blues about tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:28.047 --> 00:26:30.688]  And that's the sacrifices we make to get the job done.
[00:26:32.148 --> 00:26:33.849]  But side issue, I just miss out on a lot.
[00:26:33.889 --> 00:26:34.549]  I'm not whining.
[00:26:34.569 --> 00:26:37.551]  It's just that more people will get involved in fighting tyranny.
[00:26:38.231 --> 00:26:40.292]  Those of us fighting tyranny wouldn't have to work as hard.
[00:26:40.352 --> 00:26:43.294]  But it's a great challenge and I love it and I'm blessed to be here.
[00:26:43.714 --> 00:26:48.156]  I want to race through, call Steve, Glenn, Jay, Mark, Pat and others, but first I want to play a video clip.
[00:26:48.896 --> 00:26:54.159]  And by the same YouTube director, he's done a new one.
[00:26:56.621 --> 00:27:05.992]  First in a few minutes we're going to play the one that's on screen for folks that's just so poignant and really states it all on the record.
[00:27:06.353 --> 00:27:08.796]  He's got a new one on the mind control.
[00:27:11.505 --> 00:27:14.728]  I want to single out this YouTube director.
[00:27:14.828 --> 00:27:18.991]  Will you guys print his page for me so I can single out or show us his page.
[00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:21.793]  Let's go to the source page so folks can see it.
[00:27:21.833 --> 00:27:23.134]  One of the best directors out there.
[00:27:23.414 --> 00:27:24.375]  There's so many great ones.
[00:27:25.396 --> 00:27:26.417]  His handle is
[00:27:28.251 --> 00:27:30.615]  A-E-N-F-R-O-Y-87.
[00:27:31.236 --> 00:27:33.340]  Not the best handle, but a great page.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.381]  You can link through.
[00:27:34.802 --> 00:27:37.326]  The video is called The Final Push for World Government.
[00:27:37.346 --> 00:27:38.228]  You can Google that.
[00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:40.051]  The Final Push for World Government.
[00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:41.233]  And then you can...
[00:27:42.668 --> 00:27:46.191]  Go to his page from the link over on the right hand side.
[00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:49.394]  We're going to play two of his videos today for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:27:50.655 --> 00:27:53.477]  Obviously the audio is quite informative as well for the radio audience.
[00:27:54.018 --> 00:27:58.441]  Before we go any further, the Obama deception is about to come out.
[00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:00.143]  I'm finishing it up this weekend.
[00:28:01.328 --> 00:28:03.329]  Then it is going to go be manufactured next week.
[00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:07.351]  We'll get it back probably the 10th or 12th or so.
[00:28:07.371 --> 00:28:09.631]  Then we're going to be shipping these out packaging.
[00:28:09.672 --> 00:28:11.672]  I'm getting them ready to be shipped out starting on the 15th.
[00:28:12.033 --> 00:28:14.934]  Get your order in now to make sure they're shipped out to you first.
[00:28:15.394 --> 00:28:22.337]  Again, the obamadeception.net, the obamadeception.net or infowars.com to order or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:28:22.457 --> 00:28:22.717]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:28:31.833 --> 00:28:38.482]  Also, I want to tell you about one of our sponsors that makes the radio show possible, and that is Okola Bloom.
[00:28:40.037 --> 00:28:42.158]  A Cola Blue is an atmospheric water generator for your home.
[00:28:42.198 --> 00:28:44.418]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[00:28:44.618 --> 00:28:46.199]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:47.959]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[00:28:47.999 --> 00:28:49.960]  Produces up to 7.5 gallons a day.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.901]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[00:28:52.941 --> 00:28:54.281]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[00:28:54.681 --> 00:28:55.481]  Neutral pH.
[00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:59.043]  And the radio ad you hear, I've got to recut it, it's actually seven filters.
[00:28:59.063 --> 00:29:03.744]  We say five filters it goes through, including carbon filter, silver impregnated carbon filter,
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.601]  Reverse Osmosis and a lot more.
[00:29:06.621 --> 00:29:09.302]  Here's their number, 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, or Ecoloblue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[00:29:09.402 --> 00:29:14.744]  Okay, let's go ahead and play this video dealing with the New World Order, and I want you to listen to the
[00:29:32.056 --> 00:29:32.236]  I think?
[00:29:46.832 --> 00:29:51.455]  All these kings and queens came before us, all the crazy things they did, all the heroes, all the tyrants.
[00:29:51.835 --> 00:29:52.456]  We were all here.
[00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:55.057]  This is our special time to be alive here, now.
[00:29:55.117 --> 00:29:56.618]  And we need to think about future generations.
[00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:01.782]  Just like our ancestors lived on through us, we live on through generations that come after us.
[00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:08.397]  And realize that liberty is what everything good flows from, and tyranny is what everything bad flows from.
[00:30:09.197 --> 00:30:12.098]  If the good people don't stand up and say no to evil, evil will win.
[00:30:12.919 --> 00:30:13.839]  We don't want that to happen.
[00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:16.621]  So let's go ahead and go to this video.
[00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:17.081]  Here it is.
[00:30:18.001 --> 00:30:18.662]  That's here.
[00:30:19.542 --> 00:30:20.042]  That's home.
[00:30:20.983 --> 00:30:21.443]  That's us.
[00:30:22.864 --> 00:30:31.128]  On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was,
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:32.501]  We're good to go.
[00:30:52.404 --> 00:31:16.917]  Every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, live there, on the moat of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.
[00:31:19.779 --> 00:31:21.740]  Think of the rivers of blood
[00:31:22.819 --> 00:31:25.221]  Spilled by all those generals and emperors.
[00:31:26.522 --> 00:31:33.528]  So that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.
[00:31:45.461 --> 00:31:49.082]  Throughout history, the elite have always fought for world government.
[00:31:49.682 --> 00:31:52.303]  They've always sought to terrorize the people.
[00:31:53.003 --> 00:31:56.765]  Now they're making their final push for world government.
[00:31:58.185 --> 00:32:04.467]  The worst elements of humanity in power because they're ruthless and are willing to do what it takes to get control.
[00:32:06.828 --> 00:32:09.429]  Free humanity is having war waged upon us.
[00:32:10.939 --> 00:32:16.022]  By the social engineers, the control freaks of the New World Order.
[00:32:18.343 --> 00:32:20.925]  They funded Hitler, they funded Stalin and Mao Zedong.
[00:32:21.886 --> 00:32:25.528]  Zbigniew Brzezinski funded Pol Pot as he killed three million people.
[00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:32.032]  And now they're attempting to bring down Western Europe and the United States as they gunned all the third world nations.
[00:32:32.712 --> 00:32:33.833]  It is our turn to fall.
[00:32:34.673 --> 00:32:35.914]  Our turn to be killed.
[00:32:36.534 --> 00:32:37.195]  To be culled.
[00:32:39.202 --> 00:32:41.563]  There is a global meltdown coming.
[00:32:41.583 --> 00:32:43.364]  It is a global depression.
[00:32:43.404 --> 00:32:46.486]  And one world currency and one world financial system is the endgame.
[00:32:58.692 --> 00:33:01.495]  China said last week they want one global currency.
[00:33:01.615 --> 00:33:10.505]  France said yesterday or the day before that they want one world order, a new world order at the end of this event.
[00:33:11.755 --> 00:33:18.501]  Tonight a proposal for an expanded so-called free trade zone from Alaska to the tip of South America.
[00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:28.711]  It's a plan from the business elites, the political elites, that will cost more American jobs, cost American sovereignty, but it would fulfill the President's father's vision.
[00:33:29.031 --> 00:33:37.060]  This time, a new world order with business at the helm of trade and economic policy, effectively surrendering the sovereignty of the United States.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:43.747]  Which is what Bilderberg is into, by and large, the idea of a one world community, a new world order.
[00:33:43.787 --> 00:33:48.612]  They see themselves as a government as opposed to a group of world leaders or people with influence.
[00:33:48.772 --> 00:33:58.035]  The European leaders have been pressing for an overhaul of the whole international financial system and they will continue to do so.
[00:33:58.195 --> 00:34:03.697]  They are calling for an organization of a global summit as soon as next month.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.041]  Chancellor and Josie, very much for the transatlantic
[00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.410]  Economic integration plan.
[00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.993]  And for that too, we need to develop a common market, common standards.
[00:34:20.473 --> 00:34:23.315]  So this is indeed a very important agreement.
[00:34:38.506 --> 00:34:43.170]  Within the next four years, we will see the emergence of a new international... Excuse me, excuse me.
[00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.051]  Of a new international order.
[00:34:46.091 --> 00:34:47.091]  New world order.
[00:34:47.491 --> 00:34:48.391]  Of a new world order.
[00:34:48.812 --> 00:34:49.832]  A new world order.
[00:34:50.252 --> 00:34:50.832]  You're free.
[00:34:51.472 --> 00:34:52.573]  And freedom is beautiful.
[00:34:53.413 --> 00:34:56.874]  And, uh, you know, it'll take time to restore chaos.
[00:34:57.434 --> 00:35:04.057]  The forces shaping this world, at this moment, are so strong.
[00:35:05.617 --> 00:35:08.198]  And they all tend in one direction.
[00:35:17.338 --> 00:35:18.739]  We will expose the New World Order.
[00:35:19.219 --> 00:35:21.241]  We will expose the Global Crime Syndicate.
[00:35:21.281 --> 00:35:23.182]  To David Rockefeller.
[00:35:23.602 --> 00:35:26.064]  To the Rothschild representatives here.
[00:35:26.104 --> 00:35:27.205]  To the Queen of the Netherlands.
[00:35:27.785 --> 00:35:28.686]  To all of you.
[00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:30.747]  We tell you, you are not our queens.
[00:35:30.787 --> 00:35:31.388]  You are not our kings.
[00:35:32.268 --> 00:35:33.349]  You are not our gods.
[00:35:33.789 --> 00:35:35.030]  We do not belong to you.
[00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.471]  We are not your slaves.
[00:35:36.992 --> 00:35:44.417]  We stand as free humans, have stood since the beginning of time against the strong men, against the thugs, against the bullies.
[00:35:45.297 --> 00:35:48.818]  We're here telling you we will resist the new world order.
[00:35:49.338 --> 00:35:51.339]  We will defeat your world government.
[00:35:51.699 --> 00:35:57.460]  And if you hear the shouting, it's a group of demonstrators who've come.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.500]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:35:59.041 --> 00:36:00.401]  Oh, get a life!
[00:36:00.581 --> 00:36:01.961]  He's going after everybody.
[00:36:02.061 --> 00:36:11.544]  How do we know, how do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage, was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the bilateral commission, the CFR, and Bilderberg Group, sir?
[00:36:12.584 --> 00:36:13.745]  How dare you?
[00:36:13.785 --> 00:36:15.267]  Liberty will prevail!
[00:36:15.307 --> 00:36:16.107]  Tyranny will fall!
[00:36:16.148 --> 00:36:17.269]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:44.441]  The truth is out there in front of you!
[00:36:44.481 --> 00:36:46.902]  But they lay out this buffet of lies!
[00:36:46.962 --> 00:36:48.002]  I'm sick of it!
[00:36:48.082 --> 00:36:51.264]  And I'm not gonna take a bite out of it!
[00:36:51.284 --> 00:36:52.104]  Do you got me?
[00:37:06.152 --> 00:37:08.715]  Alright, great video there.
[00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:12.538]  Let's go ahead and play their other video, then we'll come back and take a few calls and get our next guest on.
[00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:17.243]  Let's go ahead and go to this same director's other resistance video.
[00:37:17.263 --> 00:37:19.325]  Now this gets into Barack Obama's brainwashing.
[00:37:19.365 --> 00:37:21.207]  It is extremely powerful.
[00:37:21.547 --> 00:37:23.209]  Let's start rolling this right now.
[00:37:23.269 --> 00:37:23.689]  Here it is.
[00:37:23.749 --> 00:37:24.410]  Listen carefully.
[00:37:38.576 --> 00:37:43.298]  In troubling economic times, people look to a leader for hope.
[00:37:45.519 --> 00:37:50.721]  The way we're going to win over the long term is not just militarily, we've got to win over hearts and minds.
[00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:56.123]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:37:58.104 --> 00:38:05.207]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:13.037]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.741]  The Obama Fraud.
[00:38:22.731 --> 00:38:23.932]  Welcome back to reality.
[00:38:24.253 --> 00:38:27.196]  In Pakistan, meanwhile, the first apparent U.S.
[00:38:27.236 --> 00:38:31.000]  missile strike since Barack Obama became commander-in-chief.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:37.927]  At least 17 people were killed, and the world is getting an early sample of the new administration's war on terror.
[00:38:38.367 --> 00:38:44.553]  But he can give a new impetus to American foreign policy, partly because
[00:38:45.405 --> 00:38:49.209]  The reception of him is so extraordinary around the world.
[00:38:49.229 --> 00:38:58.500]  I think his task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period when really a new world order can be created.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.722]  It's a great opportunity, it isn't such.
[00:39:01.423 --> 00:39:02.044]  I think I did.
[00:39:21.946 --> 00:39:24.549]  He's President Bush's ninth cousin once removed.
[00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:28.774]  Cheney's cousin Barack Obama is also Bush's eleventh cousin.
[00:39:28.794 --> 00:39:32.798]  One of the things I discovered is that Dick and Barack Obama are eighth cousins.
[00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:33.519]  What?
[00:39:33.539 --> 00:39:34.841]  Is that an amazing thing?
[00:39:35.061 --> 00:39:40.447]  Even Obama's administration wants to increase spending overseas and increase military spending.
[00:39:40.768 --> 00:39:42.910]  As long as you want to run the world empire,
[00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.170]  We are at a trillion dollars a year.
[00:39:44.571 --> 00:39:47.472]  Believe me, you cannot solve this problem.
[00:39:47.932 --> 00:39:52.613]  We are determined to take a serious recession and turn it into a depression.
[00:39:52.953 --> 00:39:54.074]  We don't change our ways.
[00:40:02.257 --> 00:40:05.538]  Ah, now we'll look at Obama's equal staff Rahm Emanuel, investment banker.
[00:40:05.958 --> 00:40:08.599]  Served in Israel's Defense Force as Senior Advisor to Bill Clinton.
[00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.752]  Rule number one, never allow crisis to go to waste.
[00:40:13.672 --> 00:40:15.834]  They are big opportunities to do big things.
[00:40:16.134 --> 00:40:16.754]  To quote.
[00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:20.497]  And now his youth squads.
[00:40:22.938 --> 00:40:25.260]  The idea of universal citizen service.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.821]  You have to participate.
[00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:28.822]  Citizenship is not an entitlement program.
[00:40:29.483 --> 00:40:30.964]  It comes with responsibilities.
[00:40:31.886 --> 00:40:37.929]  Everybody somewhere between the ages of 18 to 25 will serve three months of basic training and understanding in a kind of civil defense.
[00:40:38.489 --> 00:40:39.690]  So is this compulsory then?
[00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:44.012]  Well, you have to, uh, in a sense it's a required of everybody.
[00:40:44.032 --> 00:40:46.273]  18 to 25, three months.
[00:40:46.733 --> 00:40:50.775]  Because I think anytime somebody serves their country in some capacity, we're gonna be stronger for it.
[00:40:51.275 --> 00:40:57.678]  Georgia Republican Congressman Paul Brown says he fears President-elect Obama could establish a Marxist dictatorship.
[00:40:58.218 --> 00:41:05.020]  Brown said in an interview Monday, quote, it may sound a bit crazy and off-base, but he's the one who proposed this national security force.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:11.982]  Brown is referring to a July speech by Mr. Obama in which he called for a civilian force to relieve the military from its national security burden.
[00:41:12.262 --> 00:41:15.843]  That's exactly what Hitler did in Nazi Germany, and it's exactly what the Soviet Union did.
[00:41:16.183 --> 00:41:18.383]  He's showing me signs of being Marxist.
[00:41:18.704 --> 00:41:23.605]  You have to remember that Adolf Hitler was elected in a democratic Germany, end quote, called Brown.
[00:41:25.854 --> 00:41:35.160]  Zbigniew Brzezinski, Foreign Policy Advisor, Founder, Trilateral Convention, Foreign Policy Advisor, Jimmy Carter, Member of the Bilderberg Group, Host Associate, Henry Kissinger, Intel Advisor, Demetrius Corporations.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:48.366]  As America becomes an increasingly multicultural society, we'll find it more difficult to fashion consensus on foreign policy issues, except in the circumstances of a truly massive and widespread perceived external threat.
[00:41:48.426 --> 00:41:57.390]  We waged a variety of conflicts against this opportunity, but we always strove to maximize the number of supporters in order to isolate the opponent.
[00:41:58.091 --> 00:41:59.571]  I am very much for the use of power.
[00:41:59.671 --> 00:42:04.674]  I think Obama is clearly more effective and has the upper hand.
[00:42:05.114 --> 00:42:12.620]  If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf will not act, we will.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.942]  The verbal reaction was swift.
[00:42:15.462 --> 00:42:24.209]  Pakistan, being a sovereign country, will never allow any other country to send troops to its territory for any purpose.
[00:42:24.329 --> 00:42:31.034]  So Dr. Brzezinski, he has proven to be an outstanding friend and somebody who I've learned
[00:42:31.674 --> 00:42:40.598]  Do you pledge that by January 2013, the end of your first term, more than five years from now, there will be no U.S.
[00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:41.979]  troops in Iraq?
[00:42:42.039 --> 00:42:46.701]  I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation is going to be three or four years out.
[00:42:46.821 --> 00:42:50.343]  I have to say, Obama is the most inspiring man.
[00:42:50.403 --> 00:42:57.206]  He's told us all the doses of our civic duty to participate and make this one big global community.
[00:42:58.855 --> 00:43:00.136]  This man was born for this.
[00:43:00.956 --> 00:43:02.257]  And he was born to lead us.
[00:43:02.898 --> 00:43:04.679]  And I just feel so inspired.
[00:43:04.699 --> 00:43:08.661]  Someone to actually make a difference in my day.
[00:43:08.681 --> 00:43:11.523]  I feel like I am living a dream.
[00:43:12.143 --> 00:43:15.665]  I feel like I am... I'm gonna get emotional.
[00:43:16.365 --> 00:43:21.869]  I feel like I'm experiencing... We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, to finish this up and take calls.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:33.930]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:35.471]  Garden in a Can!

[00:43:54.427 --> 00:43:55.427]  Garden in a can.
[00:43:55.848 --> 00:43:56.708]  It's that simple.
[00:43:57.049 --> 00:43:57.349]  Fresh.
[00:43:57.749 --> 00:43:58.129]  Healthy.
[00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:58.910]  Easy.

[00:44:21.334 --> 00:44:29.259]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.281]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:32.256 --> 00:44:33.277]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:33.797 --> 00:44:34.318]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:34.598 --> 00:44:35.579]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:36.940]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.601]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:38.961 --> 00:44:45.706]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:46.106 --> 00:44:46.547]  Some U.S.
[00:44:46.587 --> 00:44:52.231]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:52.931 --> 00:44:56.414]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:56.434 --> 00:44:59.236]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:22.588 --> 00:45:27.751]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:45:28.031 --> 00:45:36.995]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:40.617]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:45:40.657 --> 00:45:41.017]  I think so.

[00:46:26.022 --> 00:46:29.983]  And I have to say, Obama is the most inspiring man.
[00:46:30.043 --> 00:46:36.904]  He told us all to go do our civic duty, to participate and make this one big global community.
[00:46:38.384 --> 00:46:39.924]  This man was born for this.
[00:46:40.604 --> 00:46:41.945]  And he was born to lead us.
[00:46:42.545 --> 00:46:44.385]  And I just feel so inspired.
[00:46:44.405 --> 00:46:48.066]  So I'm going to actually make a difference in my community.
[00:46:48.226 --> 00:46:51.206]  I feel like I am living a dream.
[00:46:51.786 --> 00:46:55.327]  I feel like I am... How do I get emotional?
[00:46:56.039 --> 00:46:59.780]  Um, I feel like I'm experiencing a level of inspiration.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.061]  Not only does he hear us, he feels us.
[00:47:02.741 --> 00:47:06.283]  And that when I hear Barack Obama, it's that he talks to my soul.
[00:47:09.524 --> 00:47:09.664]  Ah!
[00:47:10.864 --> 00:47:12.285]  I feel like I'm in a dream.
[00:47:12.305 --> 00:47:16.686]  Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream.
[00:47:17.186 --> 00:47:20.787]  Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.
[00:47:20.807 --> 00:47:25.309]  Except they're going over the rocks, in a big waterfall, down into the pits of hell.
[00:47:26.656 --> 00:47:34.439]  And all these poor suckers aren't going to be able to admit they've been suckered, and when they stage the terror attacks, they're going to have the brigades out, folks.
[00:47:34.459 --> 00:47:40.681]  And they're going to tell the people, if you'll just give up your liberties, we can protect you.
[00:47:40.701 --> 00:47:42.142]  And they're going to say, it's your fault.
[00:47:42.162 --> 00:47:42.742]  They're already saying it.
[00:47:42.822 --> 00:47:45.123]  Alex, you're blocking what Obama's doing.
[00:47:45.163 --> 00:47:46.604]  That's letting all the bad things happen.
[00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.784]  He's getting everything he wants, fools.
[00:47:49.765 --> 00:47:50.925]  Just like you Bush supporters.
[00:47:51.165 --> 00:47:53.026]  This is what you want, this is what you get.
[00:47:53.366 --> 00:47:55.127]  This is what you want, this is what you get.
[00:47:57.332 --> 00:47:59.512]  Alright, let's go to some phone calls here.
[00:47:59.532 --> 00:48:01.573]  Appreciate folks holding.
[00:48:01.613 --> 00:48:04.913]  Just so I can get to everybody, let's just move quickly here.
[00:48:05.513 --> 00:48:07.614]  Let's talk to Steve in Texas.
[00:48:07.654 --> 00:48:08.434]  Steve, you're on the air.
[00:48:11.974 --> 00:48:14.155]  There's some dogs back there, definitely with Al Qaeda.
[00:48:16.155 --> 00:48:17.615]  Okay, Steve.
[00:48:20.676 --> 00:48:22.216]  Let's move on to Glennon, Arizona.
[00:48:22.236 --> 00:48:23.636]  Glennon, Arizona, you're on the air.
[00:48:25.117 --> 00:48:26.377]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:48:28.702 --> 00:48:31.023]  Um, I got a couple things on my mind.
[00:48:31.043 --> 00:48:33.464]  You're thinking, sir?
[00:48:33.544 --> 00:48:34.585]  You need to be in a dream.
[00:48:35.165 --> 00:48:37.426]  Watching television and being happy and taking Prozac.
[00:48:37.486 --> 00:48:38.526]  Are you with Al-Qaeda, sir?
[00:48:39.087 --> 00:48:40.127]  Yes, I have taken the pill.
[00:48:40.147 --> 00:48:40.888]  It's the blue one, though.
[00:48:41.508 --> 00:48:41.848]  Good.
[00:48:42.248 --> 00:48:42.588]  Good.
[00:48:43.249 --> 00:48:45.169]  Um, happy birthday.
[00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:47.110]  Thank you.
[00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:50.672]  Yeah, I guess your Wikipedia page is correct.
[00:48:51.772 --> 00:48:55.094]  Um, I wanted to say thank you for everything that you do.
[00:48:55.894 --> 00:48:57.755]  I appreciate your music selection, too.
[00:48:58.624 --> 00:49:01.486]  Um, it tends to express the sentiment quite well.
[00:49:02.646 --> 00:49:06.369]  And I would like to add, uh, for what it's worth, by Buffalo Springfield.
[00:49:07.189 --> 00:49:10.171]  Oh yeah, there's a bunch of music we need to, I'm just so busy I haven't been able to mess with it.
[00:49:11.011 --> 00:49:12.292]  Um, so, thank you.
[00:49:13.453 --> 00:49:27.121]  Um, basically I'm here in Arizona and I've been seeing a progression in the amount of chemtrails in guys and every time I find myself walking outside I look up at the guy with my four year old and I get extremely mad.
[00:49:27.577 --> 00:49:29.158]  Those are nutrient trails, sir.
[00:49:29.178 --> 00:49:31.458]  Those are vitamins.
[00:49:31.478 --> 00:49:33.499]  Those are vitamins, sir.
[00:49:33.519 --> 00:49:35.060]  Well, that's good.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:42.162]  I was worried because my son has breathing problems and it just... I don't know.
[00:49:44.443 --> 00:49:56.788]  With that said, I just find it hard to find very many things to be happy about and joyful about and increasing information that's coming out with you sharing with your guests and
[00:50:00.352 --> 00:50:04.715]  Well, I mean, we're trying to take back the globalist command base with the states.
[00:50:04.755 --> 00:50:08.898]  These are murdering criminals that run it, so it's going to be a hard fight, but we don't have any other choice.
[00:50:09.458 --> 00:50:10.839]  No, this life is not boring.
[00:50:10.859 --> 00:50:17.964]  This is the animating contest for freedom and liberty, and it's always a struggle between good and evil, sir, and the people stood down, so evil took over.
[00:50:18.664 --> 00:50:19.805]  And so it's up to you.
[00:50:19.825 --> 00:50:25.247]  I mean, since 47, they've been in total secrecy with unlimited funding in the national security state.
[00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:26.928]  Of course they ship drugs in.
[00:50:27.229 --> 00:50:28.309]  Of course they money launder.
[00:50:28.389 --> 00:50:30.410]  Of course they're engaging in eugenics.
[00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:31.391]  They think they're God.
[00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:32.331]  They think we're fools.
[00:50:33.132 --> 00:50:35.233]  And we're taking action against them.
[00:50:36.853 --> 00:50:37.934]  Thank you, I appreciate that.
[00:50:38.194 --> 00:50:40.876]  So, anything in particular for Chemtrails?
[00:50:40.916 --> 00:50:45.218]  What could I do to potentially slow this down because it's disgusting?
[00:50:45.762 --> 00:50:52.527]  Well, there's a bunch of programs under the aerosol high-altitude spraying program, and it's weather modification and a lot of other things.
[00:50:52.927 --> 00:50:56.510]  So we will do more shows on that in the future, sir.
[00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:58.731]  The government's only doing it to help you.
[00:50:58.771 --> 00:50:59.252]  Remember that.
[00:50:59.292 --> 00:50:59.932]  They love you.
[00:50:59.952 --> 00:51:01.333]  They care about you.
[00:51:01.373 --> 00:51:08.518]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:51:08.538 --> 00:51:10.380]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:15.170]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:19.894]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:20.034 --> 00:51:22.796]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:22.996 --> 00:51:25.858]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:26.058 --> 00:51:30.762]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:30.922 --> 00:51:31.282]  We're good to go.
[00:51:50.765 --> 00:51:56.846]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:57.027 --> 00:52:00.767]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:52:00.787 --> 00:52:02.028]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:52:02.068 --> 00:52:02.728]  Take action today.
[00:52:02.768 --> 00:52:04.588]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.221]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:21.464]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:47.352 --> 00:52:49.054]  They talk to us like we're children.
[00:52:51.457 --> 00:52:52.378]  They treat us like children.
[00:52:52.398 --> 00:52:54.019]  We're a nation, a world of children.
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.402]  It's time to grow up and have childhoods in.
[00:52:56.442 --> 00:52:59.065]  And admit just how serious the world is.
[00:52:59.165 --> 00:53:03.790]  Or we can keep singing our nursery rhymes, watching your sitcoms.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.660]  Big babies.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.561]  Perhaps the government.
[00:53:07.581 --> 00:53:08.381]  Perhaps Obama.
[00:53:08.801 --> 00:53:10.081]  Perhaps, uh, the globalists.
[00:53:10.781 --> 00:53:11.841]  Perhaps they're your friend.
[00:53:11.861 --> 00:53:17.723]  They can take your little shoe off, take your little sock off, and go, this little piggy went to market.
[00:53:18.263 --> 00:53:19.963]  This little piggy stayed home.
[00:53:20.523 --> 00:53:22.443]  This little piggy had roast beef.
[00:53:22.984 --> 00:53:24.604]  This little piggy had none.
[00:53:25.144 --> 00:53:29.145]  This little piggy went wee-wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.
[00:53:30.385 --> 00:53:31.726]  Perhaps I should do a show like that.
[00:53:31.746 --> 00:53:33.608]  People say that they want me to be positive.
[00:53:33.668 --> 00:53:33.908]  Okay.
[00:53:34.408 --> 00:53:38.592]  The stock market was way up today and everything's going wonderful.
[00:53:38.672 --> 00:53:40.113]  Society isn't breaking down.
[00:53:40.133 --> 00:53:41.715]  There's not illegitimacy everywhere.
[00:53:43.188 --> 00:53:55.798]  Cancer isn't exploding, diabetes isn't exploding, they're not about to launch World War III with Iran, the Federal Reserve is federal and taking good care of us and good people are in command, everything's wonderful, la la la la la.
[00:53:56.779 --> 00:54:01.743]  Or I could actually be really positive and tell you the truth about what's happening, hoping that you'll take action and we can stop it together.
[00:54:03.965 --> 00:54:04.685]  But it's up to you.
[00:54:05.266 --> 00:54:10.069]  Let's go ahead and talk to this little piggy, Jay in Washington.
[00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:11.591]  Hello Jay, you're on the air.
[00:54:13.413 --> 00:54:14.373]  Jay dropped off.
[00:54:14.813 --> 00:54:16.134]  Mark in Tejas.
[00:54:16.354 --> 00:54:16.694]  Mark.
[00:54:17.834 --> 00:54:18.674]  Hey, Alex.
[00:54:19.455 --> 00:54:19.895]  Hello, sir.
[00:54:21.375 --> 00:54:22.556]  Man, I'll make it really short.
[00:54:22.776 --> 00:54:31.898]  I live in Tyler, Texas, and I'd like to thank my friend Jeff for waking me up to your show and kind of bringing me to that back in last August.
[00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:33.399]  Been listening to you ever since.
[00:54:33.979 --> 00:54:35.179]  I got something to say real quick.
[00:54:35.319 --> 00:54:36.599]  I was in Dallas last weekend.
[00:54:36.919 --> 00:54:37.900]  Blew my mind when I heard it.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.440]  It was actually kind of funny.
[00:54:41.281 --> 00:54:42.201]  Scrolling through the radios,
[00:54:42.685 --> 00:55:12.154]  radio stations and uh... got on one of these rap channels and uh... in the dallas fort worth area and in between songs the announcer lady started announcing this event that they're gonna have at some local uh... no at the reunion arena they're gonna offer you to come and drop off all your old guns for fifty dollar grocery certificates and then they enroll you with the numbers look at it was uh... in a crime I know they're doing that all over the country but in texas how shameful
[00:55:13.886 --> 00:55:15.327]  Yeah, it threw me off.
[00:55:15.827 --> 00:55:19.549]  I kind of laughed at first because, you know what I mean, it's actually happening.
[00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:20.349]  It's really going on.
[00:55:20.389 --> 00:55:23.771]  Well, you know why they did that in England and Australia before they banned guns?
[00:55:24.171 --> 00:55:27.672]  It's to create the news image of people handing in guns to police.
[00:55:28.133 --> 00:55:30.834]  And they say, they're doing the right thing, turning in guns.
[00:55:30.914 --> 00:55:33.015]  Citizens owning firearms is improper.
[00:55:33.035 --> 00:55:35.536]  Yeah, you should have heard the lady.
[00:55:35.696 --> 00:55:42.619]  She was trying to get out to that, I guess, radio listeners, and she was saying,
[00:55:43.103 --> 00:55:44.624]  Yeah, think about what it's going to do.
[00:55:44.664 --> 00:55:46.025]  The crime rate's going to go down.
[00:55:46.045 --> 00:55:50.808]  If you don't have a gun in your house, your kid can't pick up a gun and shoot his foot off.
[00:55:50.948 --> 00:55:53.089]  Yeah, that's the message, is that guns are bad.
[00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:55.491]  And you said this was a hip-hop station?
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.801]  Yeah, it was 97.9 the beat in Dallas, Florida.
[00:55:58.861 --> 00:56:01.882]  Maybe they should have said, turn in your guns.
[00:56:02.322 --> 00:56:08.505]  The government before just made the first gun laws for black people so the Ku Klux Klan can hang them and shoot them.
[00:56:08.885 --> 00:56:23.671]  Well, they want to hang and shoot everybody now, so be good slaves and let's all bring our guns down and turn them in so the New World Order can have their way with us, because we love gun control, which was started against Native Americans and black people after the Civil War.
[00:56:24.531 --> 00:56:26.875]  Maybe that should have been the message on that show, huh?
[00:56:27.296 --> 00:56:32.505]  Yeah, but no, people aren't ready for the truth and they can't handle most of it.
[00:56:33.991 --> 00:56:35.992]  You know, I mean, it's happening everywhere.
[00:56:36.012 --> 00:56:38.313]  They've got country radio stations doing it.
[00:56:38.613 --> 00:56:39.533]  It's all happening.
[00:56:39.834 --> 00:56:41.434]  The message is, guns are evil.
[00:56:41.774 --> 00:56:42.655]  Turn your guns in.
[00:56:42.715 --> 00:56:46.716]  Not, oh, this is a terrible idea in Chicago where they've taken all the guns.
[00:56:46.777 --> 00:56:47.257]  In D.C.
[00:56:47.277 --> 00:56:50.078]  and New York, they have the highest crime rates and nobody's safe.
[00:56:50.398 --> 00:56:51.499]  Maybe she should have been saying that.
[00:56:51.839 --> 00:56:54.320]  Gee, we can be like New York and Chicago and D.C.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:57:01.343]  and be hiding behind our doors at night, being raped and killed at numbers four or five times, depending on the city, the national average.
[00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:04.139]  You know, I mean, this is pathetic.
[00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:09.381]  This is pathetic, absolutely disgusting and pathetic.
[00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:12.002]  And that station should be ashamed of itself.
[00:57:12.042 --> 00:57:15.543]  Anybody else pushing this type of garbage should be as well.
[00:57:15.563 --> 00:57:21.445]  We're going to come back with F. William Engdahl joining us from Deutschland, Deutschland over in Germany.
[00:57:21.885 --> 00:57:22.386]  Stay with us.
[00:57:24.807 --> 00:57:25.927]  Hi, this is Steve Shane.
[00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:40.953]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.

[00:57:56.557 --> 00:57:57.998]  Food is an everyday need.
[00:57:58.598 --> 00:57:59.698]  The 3-Day Responder
[00:58:00.211 --> 00:58:03.714]  Is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[00:58:04.194 --> 00:58:06.235]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[00:58:07.596 --> 00:58:10.819]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[00:58:11.179 --> 00:58:13.341]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:58:13.641 --> 00:58:16.683]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:58:23.795 --> 00:58:30.159]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:30.539 --> 00:58:32.520]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.201]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:34.741 --> 00:58:35.242]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:35.542 --> 00:58:36.442]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:36.462 --> 00:58:37.883]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:37.903 --> 00:58:39.584]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:39.904 --> 00:58:46.648]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:47.028 --> 00:58:47.489]  Some U.S.
[00:58:47.529 --> 00:58:53.172]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:53.852 --> 00:58:57.354]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:57.374 --> 00:58:59.514]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:23.923 --> 00:59:27.184]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:59:27.364 --> 00:59:31.426]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:59:31.606 --> 00:59:43.030]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:49.092]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:59:49.332 --> 00:59:49.952]  We're good to go.
[01:00:13.116 --> 01:00:15.818]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver dot com.
[01:00:15.998 --> 01:00:18.781]  Or call 888-213-4338.
[01:00:18.801 --> 01:00:20.362]  888-213-4338.
[01:00:20.402 --> 01:00:23.124]  And help us win this battle.
[01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:32.691]  The Obama deception hits the info war.
[01:00:34.233 --> 01:00:40.077]  And it's destructive power to the New World Order is in your hands.
[01:00:40.097 --> 01:00:40.617]  March 15th.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.360]  The people strike back.
[01:00:50.221 --> 01:00:55.622]  It is up to you, ladies and gentlemen, if this film goes viral.
[01:00:58.903 --> 01:01:04.664]  So be sure and pre-order it today at Infowars.com, so you get yours first.
[01:01:07.004 --> 01:01:09.865]  Buy the DVD burners, the blank DVDs.
[01:01:12.643 --> 01:01:13.645]  And get ready.
[01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.792]  Get ready.
[01:01:17.653 --> 01:01:22.243]  Because this goes after him on the real issues and is power packed.
[01:01:27.222 --> 01:01:28.723]  All right, F. William Engdahl.
[01:01:28.763 --> 01:01:33.686]  We've got time zone scrambles in today's over in Germany, so if he needs to leave early, that's fine.
[01:01:34.626 --> 01:01:37.708]  We'll get to your calls and some other news coming up, but we're going to go to him right now.
[01:01:38.489 --> 01:01:39.909]  He's a writer for Asia Times.
[01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:45.833]  He's written for Foresight Magazine, grants investor, European banker in business, banker international.
[01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:49.455]  He's an expert on, I guess, monetary history, the economy.
[01:01:49.895 --> 01:01:52.617]  He's a multi-time published author and researcher.
[01:01:53.417 --> 01:01:54.857]  And a very interesting fellas.
[01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:57.178]  We always enjoy having him on for his great insight.
[01:01:58.258 --> 01:02:02.419]  Separately in his own research, separate from ours, he came upon basically the same realization.
[01:02:02.459 --> 01:02:03.820]  It's a global eugenics system.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:15.062]  But I wanted to get him on about the economy, the banks taking over, and this announcement for a new bank of the world that will rule every country on the planet.
[01:02:15.362 --> 01:02:17.303]  So, world government of and by the bankers.
[01:02:18.403 --> 01:02:26.551]  But there's this mass double thing going on where they're openly announcing everywhere world government, ruled by bankers, and calling a new world order, but then simultaneously saying it doesn't exist.
[01:02:26.571 --> 01:02:27.612]  You're insane if you talk about it.
[01:02:28.352 --> 01:02:33.397]  So just mass insanity out there by the yuppies who are accepting that.
[01:02:33.457 --> 01:02:36.580]  Yes, world government's good and I need it, and it doesn't exist when somebody criticizes it.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.682]  That way they can't even ever have an intellectual discussion.
[01:02:38.982 --> 01:02:40.444]  They go, yes, I know they're announcing world government,
[01:02:41.084 --> 01:02:42.804]  But you're insane, it doesn't exist.
[01:02:43.165 --> 01:02:44.245]  But I am for the world government.
[01:02:45.205 --> 01:02:46.345]  I mean, that's the general public.
[01:02:47.286 --> 01:02:49.526]  So, F. William Engdahl, thank you for coming on with us today.
[01:02:50.026 --> 01:02:50.887]  Good to be here, Alex.
[01:02:51.867 --> 01:02:52.927]  A lot is going on.
[01:02:52.987 --> 01:03:00.669]  I saw you write an article about Eastern Europe collapsing, being one of the big triggers for world oppression.
[01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:01.670]  I mean, break it down.
[01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:02.550]  What are we facing here?
[01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:06.731]  Well, this is unlike anything we've faced in history.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:12.003]  The United States started out as the epicenter of the storm.
[01:03:12.764 --> 01:03:18.289]  I called it two years ago in a series I wrote, The Financial Tsunami, but it's gone beyond even that at this point.
[01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:31.882]  And what you have in Eastern Europe, you have after the breakdown of the Soviet Union in the early 90s, you had the creation of a number of independent states or republics, they called it.
[01:03:32.489 --> 01:03:35.150]  In the Baltics, Poland, Hungary, and so forth.
[01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:38.391]  Many of them joined the European Union over the last few years.
[01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:50.434]  So, Western European banks saw a golden opportunity to simply grab up the financial structures of those Eastern countries, which were very underdeveloped, as you can imagine, 45 years of communism.
[01:03:51.455 --> 01:03:56.136]  And they began making loans for homes.
[01:03:56.656 --> 01:03:59.237]  It's kind of a European version of the subprime debacle.
[01:04:00.644 --> 01:04:04.647]  And they made the loans, the banks made the loans in foreign currencies.
[01:04:05.447 --> 01:04:10.731]  For example, Swiss Franc, where the interest rate was dramatically lower than it was in Poland or Hungary.
[01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:21.039]  And as long as the currency stayed stable between Poland, the Zloty, and the Swiss Franc, you had no problem in the lower interest rate.
[01:04:21.059 --> 01:04:28.145]  You just serviced your monthly payments to your local bank, which was really an Italian bank operating through your Polish subsidiary.
[01:04:29.451 --> 01:04:34.773]  And everything was hunky-dory until this crisis hit about a year ago.
[01:04:36.234 --> 01:04:50.859]  And back fourth quarter of 2008, banks in Western Europe, banks all around the world began digging into the trenches and repatriating funds to shore up the holes back home in the balance sheet.
[01:04:51.559 --> 01:04:57.241]  And what that meant was the currencies in Poland and Hungary and these Eastern countries
[01:04:57.941 --> 01:04:59.362]  They began to fall like a stone.
[01:04:59.382 --> 01:05:01.563]  35%, 40%, in some cases 50%.
[01:05:02.984 --> 01:05:09.668]  And what did that mean for Joe Polish, homeowner, who had the Swiss currency mortgage?
[01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:15.012]  Suddenly, his mortgage monthly payment, in real terms, had doubled for him.
[01:05:16.072 --> 01:05:18.033]  So, this is a ticking time bomb.
[01:05:18.073 --> 01:05:25.358]  Now, the IMF stepped in very gingerly early in the game a few months back when they gave this $14 billion bailout to Ukraine.
[01:05:26.198 --> 01:05:27.079]  We're good to go.
[01:05:46.286 --> 01:05:54.537]  To get their funds out at top dollar and let the thing collapse, at which case they can come back in and buy it back up at half the price if they want.
[01:06:01.246 --> 01:06:17.855]  They loan out fiat currency backed up by the American people and the people of the world, depending on the nation, then the bankers implode it all by destroying confidence, then they use the bailout money to protect themselves, and then they have the capital to go in and buy everything at the fire sale when everything implodes.
[01:06:18.455 --> 01:06:23.978]  Well, look at the case of Argentina back in the 90s when they had that horrendous debt crisis.
[01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:26.911]  Who did exactly that?
[01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:35.204]  The billionaire speculator from Quantum Fund, George Soros, he came back in and bought land in Argentina.
[01:06:36.064 --> 01:06:37.905]  Dirt cheap, no pun intended.
[01:06:38.345 --> 01:06:45.027]  Literally dirt cheap to the point where, as of two or three years ago, he was the largest landowner in all of Argentina.
[01:06:45.127 --> 01:06:51.310]  And then he goes on TV and badmouths what happened there or is happening here like they're the saviors.
[01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:55.271]  He goes before Congress and he explains how everything's working.
[01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:56.192]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:06:56.472 --> 01:07:00.793]  And now Brzezinski is saying, oh there's going to be a revolution, oh it's terrible, the bankers are bad.
[01:07:00.813 --> 01:07:02.214]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:07:03.564 --> 01:07:14.353]  Well, Brzezinski was the Executive Director of the Trilateral Commission of David Rockefeller, so I'm sure he's not exactly crying crocodile tears over the wolves and the vikers.
[01:07:16.905 --> 01:07:17.646]  Please continue.
[01:07:17.706 --> 01:07:19.807]  So, how do you see this global implosion?
[01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.989]  I mean, Japan imploding, China imploding, Eastern Europe imploding.
[01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:27.711]  You think, from what I've seen you writing, that Eastern Europe will be the trigger dragging down the EU?
[01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:30.032]  I mean, what's going to happen?
[01:07:30.192 --> 01:07:31.853]  It's going to get very dicey.
[01:07:32.194 --> 01:07:33.734]  It's kind of a ticking time bomb.
[01:07:33.995 --> 01:07:40.238]  And either the EU governments, which includes Germany, France, Italy in the major, and Britain as well,
[01:07:41.208 --> 01:07:48.374]  Are going to have to step in and do some emergency measures to stabilize these currencies through the European Central Bank.
[01:07:49.034 --> 01:08:00.843]  The problem is they're overstretched internally, so it's going to be a real stress test of the whole eurozone construct of the European Central Bank, the creation of the euro back in 1999.
[01:08:00.963 --> 01:08:07.228]  No one at this point, there are 1.7 trillion dollars of debts involved in Eastern Europe.
[01:08:07.548 --> 01:08:09.530]  Now, of course, not all of that is going to go sour.
[01:08:10.299 --> 01:08:12.442]  But even if 10% of that goes sour, it's $170 billion.
[01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:13.204]  That's a huge chunk of...
[01:08:19.313 --> 01:08:22.914]  Capital on top of the bad debts that are already accumulating in the western banks.
[01:08:23.014 --> 01:08:43.778]  But we have all these ticking time bombs and now the credit card debt coming due, the financial bubble with people not being able to pay for their tuition, so you have a college bubble, you have the commercial real estate bubble, you have the military defense spending bubble, you have the state spending bubble now with inflation.
[01:08:44.918 --> 01:08:51.199]  I see no way this isn't going to just accelerate into a supernova explosion of destruction financially.
[01:08:51.739 --> 01:08:52.240]  Absolutely.
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:09:14.444]  Let me say one very simple thing for listeners to sort this out, because I just actually literally today finished the last chapter on my next book, The Power of Money, Rise and Decline of the American Century, and in there if you trace back the history of the money and just going back to the time of the Civil War even before,
[01:09:15.174 --> 01:09:18.017]  The First National Bank, the Second National Bank of the United States.
[01:09:18.757 --> 01:09:26.625]  The issue is always the same and you saw it again in the remarks of Bernanke in front of the Congress yesterday.
[01:09:27.345 --> 01:09:30.568]  We will not go down the road of nationalizing the banks.
[01:09:31.049 --> 01:09:34.652]  Well, Obama as President to date
[01:09:35.487 --> 01:09:48.114]  is rapidly losing his mandate from heaven that he got from the voters back in November because he is either terrified or, as part of the game, not touching the power of the banks.
[01:09:48.154 --> 01:09:58.280]  What it boils down to is either you nationalize these banks, put them through the washing machine of a Chapter 11, write down all the toxic debt to zero value.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.222]  Zero value on the books of the United States government, which is a taxpayer
[01:10:03.062 --> 01:10:11.347]  Uh, United States Taxpayers' Government, or should be, and then you clean out the management that made this mess in the first place wholesale.
[01:10:11.868 --> 01:10:18.432]  These guys start going to prison as they should be, or they go into some kind of redemptive social work.
[01:10:19.242 --> 01:10:21.643]  Uh, to turn them back into normal human beings, if that's possible.
[01:10:21.663 --> 01:10:32.828]  Instead, they're going to use the money to leverage a total global takeover for themselves, and the criminals are smiling and posing as the saviors, and I don't think the public has any idea what's about to happen to them.
[01:10:33.409 --> 01:10:40.072]  Yeah, it's just, uh, the issue is so simple, but they make it, uh, deliberately confusing, so you don't know what's at stake here.
[01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:46.073]  Bernanke is defending the essence of American patriotism by saying we won't nationalize.
[01:10:46.093 --> 01:10:59.622]  I'll say this, Barack Obama is behaving every bit as criminally as Paulson did and Geithner did when they let this mess develop in the first place last year with the TARP program.
[01:11:00.842 --> 01:11:03.824]  Yeah, I've been watching Mrs. Obama's body language.
[01:11:03.844 --> 01:11:05.225]  She looked real happy the last few months.
[01:11:05.605 --> 01:11:07.046]  That lady doesn't look too happy now.
[01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:08.027]  She's finding out.
[01:11:08.857 --> 01:11:19.204]  Well, the United States is going to go through 10 years of hell, as I said in a recent interview, and from this point on it's going to get worse.
[01:11:19.224 --> 01:11:26.889]  2010, you have the baby boomer generation cashing in what little pensions they have in stock funds, mutual funds, 401Ks and so forth.
[01:11:27.429 --> 01:11:31.472]  So that's going to pull more money out of the stock market in significant amounts.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.781]  Uh, volumes and also the bond markets.
[01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:40.723]  You're going to have the real estate market is tanking off the charts.
[01:11:41.403 --> 01:11:43.804]  Home prices are falling and home sales and so forth.
[01:11:44.565 --> 01:11:49.446]  And it's got a long ways to go before it hits any bottom because who's going to be able to buy on these conditions?
[01:11:49.846 --> 01:11:51.227]  The banks aren't lending.
[01:11:51.447 --> 01:11:52.447]  They're sitting on their money.
[01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:58.570]  And it's just there's no new thing that's going to come in and jumpstart the U.S.
[01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.990]  economy.
[01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:02.933]  Asia that's going to come in and invest in dollars.
[01:12:03.133 --> 01:12:06.077]  China is very, very reluctant to throw... Stay there!
[01:12:06.177 --> 01:12:06.557]  Stay there!
[01:12:06.577 --> 01:12:20.033]  I want to come back, because I was interrupting you when you were getting into every bit as criminal as what we saw under Bush, and talk about your new book that's coming out as well, and if you see any way out of this, other than just identifying these criminals and hoping somebody arrests them.
[01:12:24.199 --> 01:12:29.660]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.220]  and the world.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.941]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:12:34.361 --> 01:12:40.582]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:12:40.862 --> 01:12:42.642]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:12:42.883 --> 01:12:50.824]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:12:51.104 --> 01:12:55.525]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:12:55.806 --> 01:13:01.347]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:13:01.608 --> 01:13:03.628]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:13:03.788 --> 01:13:06.029]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:13:06.329 --> 01:13:06.649]  I think so.
[01:13:23.217 --> 01:13:26.798]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:13:27.138 --> 01:13:30.659]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[01:14:23.286 --> 01:14:25.308]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:14:25.448 --> 01:14:27.830]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:30.031]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:14:30.111 --> 01:14:31.653]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:14:31.673 --> 01:14:33.294]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:14:33.394 --> 01:14:36.216]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:14:36.276 --> 01:14:40.199]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:14:49.564 --> 01:14:54.357]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:14:54.417 --> 01:14:55.561]  An inside job.
[01:14:58.226 --> 01:15:02.047]  How dare you?
[01:15:02.307 --> 01:15:05.728]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:15:05.748 --> 01:15:08.369]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:15:08.449 --> 01:15:15.051]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:15:20.192 --> 01:15:22.673]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:15:23.357 --> 01:15:29.039]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:15:29.299 --> 01:15:34.080]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:39.302]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:42.943]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[01:15:43.443 --> 01:15:51.605]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[01:15:51.945 --> 01:15:56.927]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[01:15:57.747 --> 01:16:03.488]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:16:03.728 --> 01:16:06.049]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:08.752]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[01:16:30.322 --> 01:16:32.243]  F. William Engdahl is our guest.
[01:16:32.263 --> 01:16:33.704]  We'll give you his website before he leaves us.
[01:16:34.544 --> 01:16:35.044]  Great author.
[01:16:35.565 --> 01:16:37.425]  Also writes for globalresearch.ca.
[01:16:39.747 --> 01:16:40.767]  Here we are on this ship.
[01:16:40.807 --> 01:16:42.148]  It's already run into a bunch of icebergs.
[01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:48.771]  It's going straight into a huge mountain of jagged ice.
[01:16:50.312 --> 01:16:55.294]  The very captains that have been steering us into it are dancing around, smiling.
[01:16:55.354 --> 01:16:57.075]  Obama had a ten minute standing ovation.
[01:16:58.837 --> 01:17:02.719]  Before he even began speaking, I mean, it was just amazing to see this.
[01:17:04.079 --> 01:17:06.880]  They're happy, they're celebrating, they've really screwed us.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.142]  There's no doubt from your deep research, sir, that this is completely staged?
[01:17:12.922 --> 01:17:15.203]  Or what's your take on that, and then how do we avert this?
[01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:24.527]  What Obama, the President, has around him right now, it's the people who are responsible for the mess of the financial system over the last
[01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:26.331]  Period since 1979.
[01:17:26.891 --> 01:17:36.137]  Paul Volcker is this distinguished elder statesman of monetarism that was brought down by David Rockefeller to squeeze inflation out of the system in October 1979.
[01:17:37.118 --> 01:17:37.758]  He put the U.S.
[01:17:37.798 --> 01:17:48.465]  through the worst post-war recession over the next three years to help his friends in the Wall Street bond market and prop up the dollar for his good friend David Rockefeller.
[01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:53.693]  You have Timothy Geithner, the President of the New York Fed, as U.S.
[01:17:53.733 --> 01:17:58.896]  Treasury Secretary, replacing Goldman Sachs' Henry Paulson as Treasury Secretary.
[01:17:59.477 --> 01:18:18.972]  Geithner was in on all of the decisions that were made by the Paulson-Bush administration on this mess in the first place, where they simply throw away $700 billion of taxpayer money, no accountability on the TARP program until now, unless there's something new that I haven't seen from the GAO and so forth.
[01:18:19.759 --> 01:18:23.582]  Issued reports that have been ignored by the responsible media, quote-unquote.
[01:18:24.823 --> 01:18:29.666]  There is no accountability going on and there's no indication of any change.
[01:18:29.686 --> 01:18:33.589]  Look at Larry Summers, the President's Chief Economic Advisor.
[01:18:34.129 --> 01:18:46.538]  What has he got to bring to the table but a career running the peso crisis in Mexico, running the Asia crisis for the Clinton administration, which was directed at ruining the tiger economies of Asia and redirecting their
[01:18:47.105 --> 01:18:49.085]  Capital flows or dollar flows into the U.S.
[01:18:49.145 --> 01:18:54.787]  Treasury bond market, so Clinton could claim a Treasury surplus in his last year in office.
[01:18:55.787 --> 01:19:03.529]  These are the kinds of manipulators and monetarist madmen that we have that created the problem in the first place.
[01:19:03.569 --> 01:19:13.631]  So, there's nothing... Well, the speech of Obama, he may have gotten a 10-minute standing ovation, but the President said nothing in any content that I've read
[01:19:14.475 --> 01:19:26.145]  That's offering anything more concrete than we are for change, and at a certain point in time when you're unemployed and your kids are going hungry, that mantra gets a little bit tiresome.
[01:19:27.086 --> 01:19:31.649]  So we really have to grab this thing in a much more aggressive way.
[01:19:33.871 --> 01:19:38.535]  Imagine that I were the president in the situation of the first hundred days.
[01:19:39.656 --> 01:19:42.098]  I would announce immediately a bank holiday
[01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:57.015]  I would bring in independent auditors to go through all of the major banks, not just the 19 money center banks that have been identified, but all of the major banks, especially doing business cross-border.
[01:19:57.695 --> 01:20:00.676]  And do you think you'd find that they're all a bunch of Bernard Madoffs?
[01:20:00.736 --> 01:20:05.958]  I mean, more and more... Oh yeah, Bernie Madoff was just the poster child of the system.
[01:20:07.915 --> 01:20:11.517]  What he's done is just, you know, par for the course.
[01:20:11.838 --> 01:20:13.319]  And that's why they're so secretive.
[01:20:13.339 --> 01:20:25.168]  The whole Madoff story has an intelligence background to it that hasn't, has yet to come out that's going to be a very dirty story, and somebody blew the whistle on that, but we'll know more about that as time goes on.
[01:20:25.328 --> 01:20:27.810]  Yeah, an illegal funding arm for Israel.
[01:20:28.852 --> 01:20:32.957]  Well, money conduits, money laundering, and so forth.
[01:20:33.338 --> 01:20:37.283]  That's the reason that he was considered untouchable by the Securities Exchange Commission.
[01:20:37.803 --> 01:20:41.688]  He had a certain red flag on his name, so they didn't touch him.
[01:20:41.728 --> 01:20:43.690]  But all of the details have yet to come out.
[01:20:44.331 --> 01:20:44.972]  Something involved.
[01:20:44.992 --> 01:20:48.236]  He had foundations in Israel that suddenly were left in the lurch.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:50.341]  All sorts of things.
[01:20:50.441 --> 01:21:04.791]  By the way, we'd already heard this a month and a half ago, but then it came out, I know you know this Mr. Ringelblum, some of you listeners may not, in Securities and Exchange Commission testimony before Congress, they said, we're not going to talk about Madoff, it's national security.
[01:21:05.211 --> 01:21:16.759]  They declared presidential prerogative, an executive privilege, not to cover it, confirming there's a national security letter in there, so that's really hardcore.
[01:21:17.412 --> 01:21:18.552]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:18.572 --> 01:21:19.233]  Well, there you have it.
[01:21:20.693 --> 01:21:30.136]  But anyway, the Madoff kind of thing, the Ponzi scheme, is par for the course on the Wall Street financial system for the last 35 years or so.
[01:21:30.696 --> 01:21:43.241]  But the Ponzi game, just the pyramid, got bigger and bigger and bigger, and every time it would bust, Alan Greenspan would jump in with the firehose and pump the thing up again with some low-interest rate scheme or another.
[01:21:43.261 --> 01:21:44.321]  And now,
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:49.944]  The scale of this thing is just beyond, you know, the fire brigade.
[01:21:50.144 --> 01:21:51.025]  Alright, stay there.
[01:21:51.065 --> 01:21:52.245]  Let's do ten more minutes with you.
[01:21:52.266 --> 01:21:54.747]  I want to come back and let you finish up with solutions.
[01:21:54.787 --> 01:22:00.632]  We got to the point, until we digressed, I digressed, into auditing these criminals.
[01:22:00.672 --> 01:22:03.334]  I mean, how do we actually audit these criminals?
[01:22:03.354 --> 01:22:04.995]  How do we investigate them?
[01:22:05.015 --> 01:22:05.856]  Well, it's all secret.
[01:22:05.876 --> 01:22:08.978]  They're keeping it secret because they're a bunch of Bernard Madoffs.
[01:22:09.018 --> 01:22:10.059]  I mean, he founded the NASDAQ.
[01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:10.880]  Stay with us.
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:16.742]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:22:17.663 --> 01:22:20.425]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:23.968 --> 01:22:28.251]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.

[01:23:23.849 --> 01:23:30.233]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:30.593 --> 01:23:32.254]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:33.226 --> 01:23:34.247]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:34.787 --> 01:23:35.268]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:35.588 --> 01:23:36.549]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:36.569 --> 01:23:37.890]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:39.611]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:46.697]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:47.098 --> 01:23:47.538]  Some U.S.
[01:23:47.578 --> 01:23:53.243]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:53.903 --> 01:23:57.425]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:57.805 --> 01:24:00.486]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:23.817 --> 01:24:27.120]  Aging doesn't only show in your face, but it can be felt in your body.
[01:24:27.481 --> 01:24:31.965]  You feel tired, your joints and muscles ache, and your mind seems clouded and forgetful.

[01:25:39.732 --> 01:25:42.053]  All right, we are back live with William F. Hingdahl.
[01:25:42.093 --> 01:25:46.495]  We're going to take home calls the last 15 minutes of the show or so.
[01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.977]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:49.997 --> 01:25:51.697]  Okay, go back into how we bring these people to justice.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:11.764]  You've gotten to the point of, we need to have an accounting of the Federal Reserve, accounting of these private banks, but they're all exempt from the laws, or they have their own officers in government, and it's a revolving door between administrations.
[01:26:12.324 --> 01:26:16.806]  Republicans go in, the Democrats go back into the private system.
[01:26:17.486 --> 01:26:20.988]  The Democrats go in, and the Republicans go back in the private system.
[01:26:21.028 --> 01:26:28.210]  It just goes around and around and around and around and around, and now they're conquering the world through this sleight-of-hand fraud.
[01:26:28.711 --> 01:26:29.131]  Continue.
[01:26:29.855 --> 01:26:30.155]  All right.
[01:26:49.654 --> 01:27:00.757]  For example, what has to happen is the President and the Congress need to nationalize the banks, the bankrupt banks, the brain-dead banks like Citibank, Bank of America, etc.
[01:27:00.797 --> 01:27:04.178]  But not only that, they need to nationalize the Federal Reserve.
[01:27:05.198 --> 01:27:07.159]  Bring that thing under the power of Congress.
[01:27:07.379 --> 01:27:08.920]  Congress should never have given it away.
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:17.102]  It was a coup d'etat by the Money Trust back in 1913 when the halls of Congress were virtually empty before the Christmas recess.
[01:27:18.044 --> 01:27:20.824]  In collusion with Woodrow Wilson, J.P.
[01:27:20.844 --> 01:27:24.685]  Morgan and the Bankers Cabal pulled off the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.
[01:27:25.125 --> 01:27:32.827]  That thing has to be nationalized back into public, real public hands, not the power of the private banks who control the Fed.
[01:27:33.727 --> 01:27:34.667]  Interest-free money.
[01:27:36.027 --> 01:27:42.608]  You know, two presidents have probably been assassinated because they introduced interest-free money through the U.S.
[01:27:42.668 --> 01:27:47.089]  Treasury and not through other means, through the banks, private banks.
[01:27:47.711 --> 01:27:51.993]  One of them was Abraham Lincoln and the other one was probably John F. Kennedy.
[01:27:52.213 --> 01:27:54.974]  And they tried to kill others like Andrew Jackson.
[01:27:55.655 --> 01:27:55.895]  Yeah.
[01:27:55.995 --> 01:27:59.657]  Well, Andrew Jackson, to my mind, was a heroic president.
[01:27:59.697 --> 01:28:09.001]  A few people understand what he did single-handedly to fight the renewal of the Charter of the National Bank of the United States, which was owned
[01:28:09.798 --> 01:28:24.763]  The name, just like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, sounds like it's a government bank, but it was a private bank owned by private bankers, many of them in London, not even in the United States, and controlling the gold supply and the money supply of the nation, the economy.
[01:28:25.586 --> 01:28:28.407]  So that's got to be brought back in public hands.
[01:28:28.907 --> 01:28:41.751]  Article 1, Section 8 of the American Constitution, the Founding Fathers put the power to coin and regulate money into the hands of Congress as the first article of the Constitution.
[01:28:42.252 --> 01:28:43.332]  That was given away
[01:28:44.463 --> 01:28:52.028]  Illegally and to my mind criminally by this coup d'etat of the bankers and certain colluding congressmen.
[01:29:15.664 --> 01:29:22.048]  Horizontally integrated, or no, vertically integrated consolidation by the offshore banks.
[01:29:22.708 --> 01:29:24.590]  Yeah, well that's what they're trying to do.
[01:29:24.630 --> 01:29:26.431]  That was the Paulson idea.
[01:29:26.531 --> 01:29:27.972]  I think they miscalculated.
[01:29:28.012 --> 01:29:43.842]  We've differed on this previously Alex, but I think they miscalculated on the fallout from the Lehman Brothers when it became incalculable which banks or which institutions would be saved too big to fail and which not after that.
[01:29:44.957 --> 01:29:58.808]  So then the situation really started to get non-linear quick, but I think what they're going to try to do is regroup, create financial behemoths out of this mess as much as they can.
[01:29:59.328 --> 01:30:09.335]  But I think the problems are so deep that this is even coming beyond their means to manipulate the finances.
[01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:33.916]  In the backwoods of the places like Bohemia Grove, or the Trilateral Commission, or Bilderberg, or wherever they meet these days, these characters who call themselves the guiding elites of the nation are really beginning to think the only option they have is the military option, but even that they've largely wasted away through the last eight years of
[01:30:35.257 --> 01:30:39.580]  Madness under the Bush-Cheney administration in Iraq, Afghanistan and so forth.
[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:44.763]  Start a war so big that the people have to get behind them and the austerity and the implosion.
[01:30:45.243 --> 01:30:46.764]  And that's what concerns me most.
[01:30:47.064 --> 01:30:53.268]  And I actually agree with you that it's gotten even out of their control at many levels, but there's still the instinct to greedily steal and consolidate power.
[01:30:53.328 --> 01:30:58.631]  It's overriding even self-preservation because it's a ship of rogues and there's no honor.
[01:30:59.051 --> 01:31:00.933]  Because I know a lot of big money.
[01:31:01.773 --> 01:31:03.134]  I know people that know a lot of big money.
[01:31:03.174 --> 01:31:08.858]  I mean, billionaires that live in Austin and have houses in New York and other places, they've all been leaving the last three years.
[01:31:09.558 --> 01:31:16.463]  And, you know, from corporate lawyers and other people I know, they're saying, quote, America won't exist
[01:31:17.003 --> 01:31:17.163]  By 2010.
[01:31:17.683 --> 01:31:27.748]  And so they're literally taking their billions and building armored compounds in the islands of the Caribbean and in the Cook Islands.
[01:31:28.549 --> 01:31:30.370]  And they're literally building bunkers.
[01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:32.251]  I mean, what do they think they've done?
[01:31:32.271 --> 01:31:35.912]  Yeah.
[01:31:36.073 --> 01:31:38.914]  At a certain point, there's no real place to hide.
[01:31:38.934 --> 01:31:42.636]  You know, this affects everybody.
[01:31:43.436 --> 01:31:44.817]  You can't live on another planet.
[01:31:46.152 --> 01:31:49.634]  So what do they think they've done, that they're evacuating?
[01:31:50.935 --> 01:31:52.836]  Yeah, I read you.
[01:31:53.696 --> 01:32:06.023]  I think they realize that there are going to be some very, very angry citizens who are going to wake up and say, wait a minute, how did the head of Citibank accumulate a billion dollars as president of a bank?
[01:32:06.912 --> 01:32:16.721]  How many fraudulent predatory loans did he push on people who couldn't even write their own name, but were told they would get a dream house if they just put an X on a piece of paper?
[01:32:17.662 --> 01:32:30.855]  And knowing that that was going to default, but they didn't care because it would be securitized through a special investment vehicle that was off the bank's books, and you'd get a triple A rating from Moody's or Standard & Poor's.
[01:32:32.529 --> 01:32:41.255]  Pump the thing into some pension fund or some university pension fund at Harvard or Yale or who knows where, and spread this toxic waste all around the globe.
[01:32:41.876 --> 01:32:43.137]  I mean, that's the kind of mentality.
[01:32:43.397 --> 01:32:53.384]  I think some of these heads of banks like JPMorgan Chase and so forth, they believed on a certain level that this was a mathematical science.
[01:32:55.401 --> 01:33:01.986]  Black and Scholes back in the 70s came up with this fraudulent options pricing model that seemed to be mathematical.
[01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:12.854]  They thought, we've got the, not the Rosetta Stone, but the magic Midas stone that turns water into gold.
[01:33:13.995 --> 01:33:18.639]  And all we have to do is get these rocket scientists in our banking trading floor and
[01:33:19.181 --> 01:33:37.167]  We'll figure out schemes and sell these derivative products, these credit default swaps and so forth, make a killing, manipulate oil prices up or down, like banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have done for years, and we'll just make money out of thin air.
[01:33:39.608 --> 01:33:41.769]  At a certain point, you can't write a derivative
[01:33:42.293 --> 01:33:47.376]  On the entire global financial system, there's no counterparty to that particular contract, mister.
[01:33:47.716 --> 01:34:05.987]  So, in closing, from you studying this, F. William Engdahl, what are they trying, I mean, we know they're trying to bring a new World Bank, World Government out of what they've created, but it's so destructive that individually they're buying redoubts, armored keeps, to evacuate, to, I mean, it's clear they want to secure the theft,
[01:34:07.168 --> 01:34:07.868]  Yeah, it doesn't.
[01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:08.608]  And it isn't.
[01:34:08.628 --> 01:34:16.390]  I've been told by some very senior financial sources in Switzerland recently that the view is to let the markets go through pure hell up until the time of the
[01:34:37.404 --> 01:34:51.874]  April 2 G20 Economic Summit and then by that point terrify nations like Russia and China into going along with this new world order that you're talking about.
[01:34:52.554 --> 01:34:54.575]  I frankly don't think that they're going to buy into that.
[01:34:54.715 --> 01:34:59.979]  I don't think that's going to happen and there is no plan B for these guys.
[01:35:00.499 --> 01:35:05.523]  They are so used to just ramming their way through any obstacle over the past
[01:35:06.846 --> 01:35:07.527]  I don't know.
[01:35:18.452 --> 01:35:18.972]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:35:18.992 --> 01:35:21.874]  Hillary went to China and said, keep buying our treasuries.
[01:35:21.934 --> 01:35:24.056]  And they said, look, it's worthless crap.
[01:35:24.076 --> 01:35:24.977]  Well, what are we going to do?
[01:35:25.677 --> 01:35:27.239]  And they're like, Siamese twins.
[01:35:27.279 --> 01:35:28.379]  We're all tied together.
[01:35:29.901 --> 01:35:35.885]  China has some options that are viable at this point.
[01:35:35.905 --> 01:35:39.949]  But countries like the United States, there's no industry left to
[01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:43.736]  China's built up brand spanking new factories.
[01:35:44.097 --> 01:35:45.618]  I've seen this first-hand.
[01:35:45.758 --> 01:35:46.579]  It's quite impressive.
[01:35:46.599 --> 01:35:49.541]  The highway infrastructure is state-of-the-art.
[01:35:49.621 --> 01:35:50.121]  Trains.
[01:35:50.402 --> 01:35:51.523]  Airplanes and so forth.
[01:35:51.863 --> 01:35:52.483]  Fast trains.
[01:35:53.184 --> 01:35:54.605]  You don't have that in the United States.
[01:35:54.665 --> 01:35:57.167]  We've become a post-industrial junk heap.
[01:35:57.407 --> 01:35:59.169]  But our men act tough, though.
[01:35:59.209 --> 01:36:02.131]  They strut around like this, going... They watch football.
[01:36:02.191 --> 01:36:03.612]  I mean, that's a product, isn't it?
[01:36:03.632 --> 01:36:05.274]  That accounts for a lot at the end of the day.
[01:36:05.894 --> 01:36:11.178]  Yeah, and our women act and dress and behave like whores, and the family's falling apart.
[01:36:11.238 --> 01:36:12.860]  I mean, isn't that tough?
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:13.760]  I mean, that's tough!
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:14.641]  Man, we're tough!
[01:36:15.422 --> 01:36:16.082]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:16.623 --> 01:36:19.004]  These are the tragic victims of this madness.
[01:36:19.064 --> 01:36:27.891]  But, you know, I just don't see it happening in this grand, beautiful scenario way.
[01:36:29.268 --> 01:36:36.774]  The rest of the world is going to bow down and tell the Money Trust, okay, we'll be your slaves and we'll do anything you tell us if you just print some more dollar bills.
[01:36:36.995 --> 01:36:42.379]  I think that's why I titled my book, Power of Money, Rise and Decline of the American Century.
[01:36:42.439 --> 01:36:47.964]  The American Century, the dollar system of the Bretton Woods, 1944, is over.
[01:36:48.324 --> 01:36:50.466]  It's the death agony that we're going through now.
[01:36:50.486 --> 01:36:51.226]  The globalists!
[01:36:51.266 --> 01:36:54.349]  Millions of people are affected by that misery.
[01:36:54.889 --> 01:36:57.492]  But, you know, until they
[01:36:58.570 --> 01:37:01.773]  Well, we don't have any Hercules out there that's going to do it, and in closing,
[01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:24.467]  When we're looking at this, look at Mexico, triple the resources of the U.S., collapsing.
[01:37:24.827 --> 01:37:27.188]  South Africa, more resources than we have, collapsing.
[01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:33.670]  I mean, that's the norm in history, is corrupt thugs get in, they steal everything, everything collapses, and they move on like locusts.
[01:37:33.730 --> 01:37:37.892]  Well, it happens when you give the country's power over to the money interests.
[01:37:38.692 --> 01:37:41.173]  It happened in the Roman Empire 400 years ago.
[01:37:42.731 --> 01:37:56.897]  It happened in every empire in history, the British Empire, and it's happened with the informal American post-war system, which they deliberately, the elites deliberately, decided not to call it an empire.
[01:37:56.977 --> 01:38:10.323]  It's one of the most effective deceptions in history, but it's every bit the empire, and the people who framed it from George Kennan on down privately called it an empire, but they said we'll be more clever than the British.
[01:38:11.091 --> 01:38:17.141]  We'll call it the Spreading the Torch of Liberty, Freedom, Democracy, the American Way of Free Enterprise.
[01:38:17.662 --> 01:38:25.574]  Well, okay, now you have the American Way of Free Enterprise that they're talking about, and it's just reached the limits of growth.
[01:38:27.202 --> 01:38:29.602]  Well, I see the globalists reach the limits of growth.
[01:38:29.983 --> 01:38:33.783]  Yeah, the tick weighs 200 pounds, the host is anemic and weighs 25 pounds.
[01:38:34.163 --> 01:38:51.587]  It's a tiny 25 pound creature with a huge bloated tick going, you know, with like TV sets broadcasting propaganda at the little starving concentration camp victim going, I love you, I love you, I'm the government, these men in black uniforms are here to help, and we're laying on the ground going, ugh, yes, government, I love you.
[01:38:51.627 --> 01:38:53.687]  That's a great cartoon idea for someone like David Dees.
[01:38:54.585 --> 01:38:57.629]  Alright, well, listen, F. William Engdahl, I want you to be able to give your website out.
[01:38:57.669 --> 01:39:00.013]  I'm going to come in and take a few final calls in the last seven.
[01:39:00.033 --> 01:39:01.054]  We're going to let you go, but...
[01:39:02.068 --> 01:39:08.471]  I mean, I see the Davos folks and others bragging that, oh, America's time is over, Time Magazine.
[01:39:08.511 --> 01:39:09.451]  It's all our fault.
[01:39:09.491 --> 01:39:10.191]  We did it.
[01:39:10.852 --> 01:39:13.433]  And now we're going to implode and we deserve it.
[01:39:14.033 --> 01:39:15.334]  But that was always the plan.
[01:39:15.474 --> 01:39:20.276]  Use us up, building the world order, and kind of have its pole move more towards Europe and Russia and China.
[01:39:20.576 --> 01:39:23.417]  And they're all New World Order, you know, scam artists, too.
[01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.558]  They just weren't the top guys.
[01:39:25.978 --> 01:39:27.999]  So I see a new dark age in the U.S.
[01:39:28.039 --> 01:39:30.060]  collapsing with third world
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:31.801]  Well, it's going to be grim.
[01:39:31.941 --> 01:39:33.782]  I can't paint a rosy picture about it.
[01:40:04.087 --> 01:40:13.355]  Or just Google F. William Engdahl and you'll find it E-N-G-D-A-H-L.

[01:40:39.577 --> 01:40:46.120]  And grand juries do, we can stop them, we can fix the bleeding, but I know you're into a power trip and you've just got to be destroyed.

[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:50.021]  Just at least know you did it to yourself.
[01:40:50.101 --> 01:40:55.744]  I mean, that's the most important thing here, is that in the end you repent of what you've done.
[01:40:56.504 --> 01:40:57.504]  That's what life's all about.
[01:40:59.545 --> 01:41:08.309]  You've been suckered by the New World Order, sold by their mind control experts, servants of evil out there, and you think you're part of the pet puppies, the chosen ones that will be protected.

[01:46:47.166 --> 01:46:49.388]  Welcome, Pat.
[01:46:49.408 --> 01:46:50.349]  Good to have you on with us.
[01:46:51.450 --> 01:46:52.191]  Hello, Alex.
[01:46:52.211 --> 01:46:53.372]  You're a hard guy to get a hold of.
[01:46:54.436 --> 01:47:00.458]  I wanted to call and thank you for your tireless research, your insight, your determination in waking us all up.
[01:47:00.858 --> 01:47:04.979]  It's, uh, I shudder to think where... Well, it's like being in a water chamber with the water rising.
[01:47:05.019 --> 01:47:08.740]  I mean, I don't need to be commended for trying to get the hell out of here.
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:12.961]  No, I'm just very happy that there's somebody on the air that is committed as you are.
[01:47:13.561 --> 01:47:15.962]  Anyway, I had a whole bunch of things I wanted to talk about.
[01:47:15.982 --> 01:47:18.803]  That was before the last speaker, and now I'm on the banks.
[01:47:20.598 --> 01:47:22.858]  That Andrew Jackson's farewell speech.
[01:47:24.099 --> 01:47:25.119]  People can Google that.
[01:47:25.239 --> 01:47:28.300]  It basically spells out exactly what's going on right now with the banks.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:31.960]  It's totally predictable with a fiat currency and a private bank.
[01:47:32.901 --> 01:47:42.823]  And these guys have been consolidating power and wealth since the Holy Wars, and this last chapter since Rothschild and the Napoleonic Wars.
[01:47:42.843 --> 01:47:42.823]  1815!
[01:47:43.763 --> 01:47:44.503]  Yeah.
[01:47:45.503 --> 01:47:47.824]  Yeah, that was a great speech.
[01:47:50.529 --> 01:47:51.209]  Let's see.
[01:47:52.530 --> 01:47:59.112]  I was wondering if you had any updates on Max Keiser and the COMEX prediction that he made?
[01:47:59.832 --> 01:48:05.033]  Yeah, well, the mainstream news is saying the COMEX might default, but we need to get Max Keiser back on.
[01:48:05.053 --> 01:48:09.375]  I'm supposed to go on his BBC show in the next few weeks, but we'll do that, Pat.
[01:48:09.395 --> 01:48:09.955]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:09.975 --> 01:48:10.695]  Call back again sometime.
[01:48:10.715 --> 01:48:11.415]  We'll have you on longer.
[01:48:11.755 --> 01:48:13.616]  Jason in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:48:14.949 --> 01:48:20.931]  Yeah, I was wondering about the pandemic flu and if the government's behind it for martial law.
[01:48:21.272 --> 01:48:22.632]  Oh yes, they're definitely behind it.
[01:48:22.712 --> 01:48:24.273]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:48:24.553 --> 01:48:27.734]  That's one of the little tricks, little loving things they have ready for us.
[01:48:27.754 --> 01:48:37.398]  Well, I know they're supposed to meet people at the fairgrounds to get shots and stuff, and I know right now that armored trucks are delivering flu shots right now to our county.
[01:48:38.018 --> 01:48:39.199]  Well, that's good.
[01:48:39.219 --> 01:48:39.299]  Yeah.
[01:48:39.459 --> 01:48:42.622]  Be sure and take the injections, the government.
[01:48:42.662 --> 01:48:44.003]  Yeah, I'm going to take the injections.
[01:48:44.023 --> 01:48:46.385]  I think I'll eat some sauerkraut or something I heard about.
[01:48:49.347 --> 01:48:51.449]  You're not going to take the injection when they order it?
[01:48:51.509 --> 01:48:51.689]  Oh, no.
[01:48:52.190 --> 01:48:53.651]  No, I'm going to run for the hills.
[01:48:53.931 --> 01:48:57.774]  You're not with Al-Qaeda, are you?
[01:48:57.794 --> 01:48:58.475]  Jason.
[01:48:58.695 --> 01:48:59.275]  It's scary.
[01:48:59.295 --> 01:49:01.257]  Good to hear from you, Jason.
[01:49:01.337 --> 01:49:02.898]  Lou, en masse.
[01:49:03.699 --> 01:49:04.500]  Lou, you're on the air.
[01:49:09.074 --> 01:49:23.643]  I've been listening to you for about a year and a half, and I know that you think the History Channel is down on you, but the History Channel is actually the one that woke me up.
[01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:29.931]  Uh, what's the, basically the hit piece on you and... Oh yeah, that, listen, their propaganda only backfires on them, but shhh!
[01:49:30.431 --> 01:49:31.552]  Don't let them know the secret.
[01:49:33.192 --> 01:49:34.372]  Don't, don't, shhh!
[01:49:34.972 --> 01:49:36.613]  Everybody attacking only helps.
[01:49:37.253 --> 01:49:40.014]  Listen, I was, I was watching this and I was... Please don't attack me!
[01:49:40.214 --> 01:49:41.974]  Please don't put me on TV and say horrible things!
[01:49:42.194 --> 01:49:43.274]  Please, no, don't do it!
[01:49:43.334 --> 01:49:44.034]  No, it's hurting me!
[01:49:44.275 --> 01:49:45.935]  No, it's people on the internet lying about me!
[01:49:45.975 --> 01:49:46.455]  Don't do it!
[01:49:46.555 --> 01:49:46.875]  No!
[01:49:47.195 --> 01:49:48.295]  No, don't, please!
[01:49:48.375 --> 01:49:48.776]  Not that!
[01:49:48.796 --> 01:49:49.616]  Oh, help me!
[01:49:49.836 --> 01:49:50.456]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:49:51.397 --> 01:49:52.798]  I'm weak!
[01:49:53.239 --> 01:49:54.100]  I'm too weak!
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.722]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:49:56.742 --> 01:49:58.284]  I was in Chantilly with you.
[01:49:58.324 --> 01:49:59.325]  I saw you in Chantilly.
[01:49:59.385 --> 01:50:01.268]  I was there doing a lot of filming.
[01:50:01.288 --> 01:50:03.110]  I put a YouTube video up.
[01:50:03.170 --> 01:50:07.294]  If anybody wants to check it out, just search Mask DLD.
[01:50:08.576 --> 01:50:10.478]  I got some great footage of you with the double bullhorn.
[01:50:10.518 --> 01:50:11.038]  It was awesome.
[01:50:11.519 --> 01:50:12.120]  Well done!

[01:51:25.918 --> 01:51:30.642]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:30.862 --> 01:51:31.803]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:31.983 --> 01:51:34.925]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
