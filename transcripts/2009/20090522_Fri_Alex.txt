[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.313]  Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:06.955]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.525]  During the break, I confirmed what Bob Chapman was saying.
[00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:25.891]  I'm glad he pointed it out to me, because I can't keep track of everything.
[00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:31.797]  179 sponsors for the bill to audit the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:36.939]  Audit it, expose how criminal it is, and then abolish it and get our country back.
[00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.801]  It is not federal, it is foreign-owned, it is the bankers that have engineered the crisis.
[00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:45.203]  And here's our newest t-shirt, our newest In The Fed t-shirt, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:46.664]  Look at that baby.
[00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:50.045]  On the front it says, In The Fed, and people say, what's that about?
[00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:52.126]  And it says, Infowars.com.
[00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:54.487]  Above it has the great distressed look, black t-shirt.
[00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:58.229]  On the back it says, Arrest the bankers!
[00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:59.890]  Arrest the banksters!
[00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:06.927]  I tell ya, what a great design from Janae Meadows that does so much of the designing for InfoWars.com.
[00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:12.733]  There is the new t-shirt available at InfoWars.com for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:12.753 --> 00:01:18.778]  If you're listening on the radio, you can go over to InfoWars.com, click on the banner at the top for all the new t-shirts we've got.
[00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:20.279]  Here's one of our other t-shirts.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.183]  In a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:25.024]  George Orwell.
[00:01:26.473 --> 00:01:31.297]  1948.
[00:01:26.614 --> 00:01:31.297]  Okay, we got Tony Gosling with us for 20-30 minutes or so.
[00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:46.430]  I'm going to continue with your calls with Tex and Janet and Lance and many others that are holding and then later at the end of the hour I'm going to go over this review in the New York Times of the film that I'm in called The New World Order where they savage me, Luke Radowsky and others.
[00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.834]  I'm not covering this New York Times attack because it's about me.
[00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:52.936]  It's a window into the
[00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:57.413]  Disconnect between these establishment lackeys and the real world.
[00:01:57.553 --> 00:01:58.714]  They think we're delusional?
[00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:01.895]  Just incredible.
[00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:05.397]  So that is coming up, but Tony Gosling...
[00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:09.114]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on.
[00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:32.165]  Good to have you here.
[00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:42.388]  Yeah, I was driving in the car and I heard you on George Butler's show this weekend and I interviewed you before and I thought, man, he really is breaking down the history great and bringing out a lot of things that I didn't even know about.
[00:02:42.408 --> 00:02:51.191]  I knew about some of it, but like the submarine delivering Nazis and Prince Bernhard in Canada and all of that, it was just really intriguing, so I wanted to have you on.
[00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:58.193]  Yeah, I mean, I think, I'm not sure, Alex, are you and your listeners familiar with the two main characters behind the first Bilderberg meeting?
[00:02:59.662 --> 00:03:04.027]  What is it, Joseph Rattinger, and then Bernhard and then one other.
[00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:05.269]  Bernhard died about 3 or 4 years ago.
[00:03:17.402 --> 00:03:41.190]  And after that, I don't know if you've heard this, but there was a fantastic BBC Radio 4 documentary as part of the series document, which looked really closely at his involvement, Bernhard's involvement, immediately after the Second World War in smuggling Nazi war criminals out of Europe and across to South America.
[00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.891]  So Bernhard was actually a key person in that as it came out in this documentary.
[00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:49.443]  And it's interesting that the BBC have been able to do that after his death, I guess.
[00:03:51.343 --> 00:03:53.064]  Tony, do me a favor and back off your phone.
[00:03:53.144 --> 00:03:55.105]  We always have trouble over to England for some reason.
[00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:59.867]  Or maybe it's the phone system at Genesis again, but back off that phone for it so it's not distorted.
[00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:06.249]  Yes, I was aware of that BBC report, multi-part series.
[00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.370]  I listened to most of it.
[00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.111]  And it was just going off Bilderberg's own documents and what's been released by the Royal House.
[00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:12.972]  This is not our opinion.
[00:04:13.972 --> 00:04:18.615]  And I want you to go through that history for those that may not know it, because you're so good at telling it and have so much research.
[00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:21.396]  How does that dovetail with the British and U.S.
[00:04:21.556 --> 00:04:34.023]  Army reports about what we already had pieces of, about in the 43-44, the Nazis knew they were going to lose, so they put their money through the Crumps and others into setting up a European Union through dummy corporations.
[00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:39.807]  And then in 54, I see it as kind of the Nazi wealth teaming back up and merging again
[00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:49.589]  With the Anglo-American establishment, that coming together, that transatlantic union, you know, she can't really say Bilderberg is Nazi.
[00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:56.471]  It is elitist, but it has that core group of Nazis in it, wanting a European Union.
[00:04:57.791 --> 00:04:58.431]  Well, that's right.
[00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:03.452]  I mean, this is really well put together by this academic, Mike Peters.
[00:05:04.093 --> 00:05:09.934]  Professor Mike Peters, he was up at, until recently, he's just recently retired in the last year or so.
[00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:10.849]  I don't know.
[00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:49.288]  And it's called Bilderberg and the Project for European Unification and it starts out really as a sort of academic pamphlet but it's really very readable and it goes into all of the sort of nuts and bolts of the initial meetings that led to people thinking that Bilderberg was going to be necessary.
[00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:58.375]  So we're talking about back in 1943, the Council on Foreign Relations, War and Peace Study Groups over in the States, deciding
[00:05:58.922 --> 00:05:59.622]  We're good to go.
[00:06:23.011 --> 00:06:29.975]  And this was also tied into the whole European movement, the idea that it was essential to get a political union right across Europe.
[00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:35.939]  Now, I don't get involved in Protestants and Catholics fighting.
[00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:39.461]  I don't get into this religious craziness.
[00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.523]  This is a radio show, a news program.
[00:06:43.447 --> 00:06:53.111]  And I have found that there's some crowds out there that obsess on Catholics and Catholic intrigue and Catholic secret societies and everybody's a secret agent of it.
[00:06:53.671 --> 00:07:01.294]  And so I, for years, thought that was discredited and stupid and silly because some of the proponents of it were so ridiculous.
[00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:04.215]  But then, through being attacked,
[00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:24.387]  I did actually look at it deeper, and then when I was doing research for Endgame on the founding of Bilderberg, European Union, all of that, the Nazi connections, the Catholic Church connections, the Treaty of Rome 57, how they say the European Union will be the new Holy Roman Empire, and I went, wow, that's actually true!
[00:07:25.227 --> 00:07:31.491]  And then how Tony Blair has converted to Catholicism so he can be a new EU head, and they denied that, and now they're talking about it.
[00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:40.354]  And then all these weird P2 Lodges interconnecting, and then Joseph Redinger, and all of that.
[00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:43.635]  I mean, there really is something there at the bottom of it.
[00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:44.895]  I don't see it quite like that, though, Alex.
[00:07:44.975 --> 00:07:51.157]  I mean, what I see is, I see the Catholic Church, almost the Vatican, kind of besieged by all these different organizations.
[00:07:51.177 --> 00:07:58.440]  I mean, the idea of Tony Blair knocking on the door and wanting to be their friend is an attempt, I think, to influence
[00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:03.383]  So you're saying the European Union isn't being pushed strongly by the Catholic Church?
[00:08:03.423 --> 00:08:04.284]  No, I don't see it like that.
[00:08:04.304 --> 00:08:08.227]  I think there are elements in all of the churches right across Europe
[00:08:22.662 --> 00:08:25.684]  Which are, I mean, there's battles going on within those institutions.
[00:08:25.744 --> 00:08:33.589]  If you want, it's something a little bit like an organization like the BBC that can come out with a fantastic documentary on one subject.
[00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:38.772]  Maybe they did a very good job on the David Kelly story, that hour-long documentary, if people haven't seen it.
[00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:40.273]  You're saying there's different camps?
[00:08:40.534 --> 00:08:43.335]  You're saying there's different camps within the same organization?
[00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:48.759]  And also, they're under assault, organized assault from outside, so that there are outside agencies.
[00:08:49.227 --> 00:08:52.968]  Sending, you know, people to infiltrate these organizations and influence them.
[00:08:53.008 --> 00:08:53.448]  Exactly.
[00:08:53.528 --> 00:08:54.488]  I just wanted your opinion.
[00:08:54.508 --> 00:08:58.949]  And we also noticed that it's only kosher to attack the Catholic Church.
[00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:00.830]  And very popular.
[00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.270]  And there's certainly a lot to attack.
[00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.351]  But by the mainstream media, that's always questionable as well.
[00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:10.612]  I think there's a good reason for that, actually.
[00:09:10.652 --> 00:09:11.332]  And that is that
[00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:32.650]  The Protestant Church has traditionally welcomed Freemasons, and lots of the Protestant Church, certainly here in Britain, I mean I don't know about elsewhere in Scotland as well, it's actually quite normal for Freemasons to be in the Church, even though they won't talk about it, whereas the Catholics have had many edicts, quite whether they're taking notice of it or not is another thing,
[00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:39.555]  You know, papal declarations against Freemasonry saying that this, you know, Freemasons cannot be in the Church.
[00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:41.757]  So I think that's one of the interesting things about this.
[00:09:41.777 --> 00:09:51.443]  When I see that, I think, well, hang on a minute, you know, what the Protestants are doing is they're ignoring the beam in their own eye and pointing the finger at the Catholics.
[00:09:51.743 --> 00:10:01.510]  But this is, I think, part of the attempt to kind of get these various quite powerful institutions which are in the way of all these New World Order style changes
[00:10:02.249 --> 00:10:03.250]  Uh, fighting each other.
[00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.632]  Just as they've been doing, obviously, in, uh... Sure, sure, it's divide and conquer.
[00:10:07.352 --> 00:10:08.253]  Sure, it's divide and conquer.
[00:10:08.273 --> 00:10:18.079]  Just like right now, they don't want it to be liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans fighting with each other over left, right, when left, right are all unified at the top to bring in the new world order.
[00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:20.041]  But, uh, I didn't mean to have you digress there.
[00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:26.785]  I just wanted to go into, uh, some of that because, uh, wasn't Reddinger, like, a Jesuit or something?
[00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:28.732]  Well, he was a Freemason.
[00:10:28.772 --> 00:10:35.397]  I don't know about him being a Jesuit, but he certainly was a Freemason, and this is one of the interesting things that's come out.
[00:10:35.798 --> 00:10:45.606]  I mean, we've got quite a good Polish community here in Bristol, and I was chatting to some Polish people, and they're going, ah, right, yeah, this guy, Rettinger, is big news, even though he died such a long time ago, you know.
[00:10:45.966 --> 00:10:55.674]  In Poland, there are people writing books now about him, and about how this interesting Polish-born guy was working for MI6 during the Second World War, looking after the Polish leader in exile,
[00:10:56.458 --> 00:11:02.907]  Uh, how he was, you know, there would be people picking apart his life, uh, as he was growing up in Poland and things like this.
[00:11:02.987 --> 00:11:06.492]  But of course, this stuff is all only in Polish, yeah?
[00:11:06.512 --> 00:11:10.878]  So, it's one of, one of the things I'm working on at the moment is trying to get some of this stuff out into the English language.
[00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:12.163]  All right, stay there.
[00:11:12.183 --> 00:11:13.284]  Bilderberg.org.
[00:11:13.304 --> 00:11:17.227]  We're going to have to hold you longer than 30-40 minutes because I'm really getting intrigued.
[00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:31.600]  Let's get into what we know about Bilderberg, how it was founded, what its goals are, these army reports that are confirmed about the Nazi money going into it, that merger of the Anglo-American establishment with the old European elite, with Germany at the center.
[00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:33.402]  Certainly, Germany is the heart of the EU.
[00:11:34.663 --> 00:11:35.884]  Uh, that can't be debated.
[00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:40.328]  And so we'll break all that down and then get any latest intel you've got from England.
[00:11:40.348 --> 00:11:42.169]  I know you always get a lot of inside info.
[00:11:42.189 --> 00:11:43.370]  This turned out to be pretty accurate.
[00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:45.932]  At boldenburg.org, Tony Gosling is our guest.
[00:11:45.952 --> 00:11:46.873]  Your call's coming up.
[00:11:47.233 --> 00:11:50.676]  And I'll break down the sickening New York Times attack on myself and others.
[00:11:51.036 --> 00:11:51.457]  Stay with us.
[00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:00.517]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:12:00.697 --> 00:12:02.961]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:07.107]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:12:07.267 --> 00:12:09.070]  If you're a politician who voted for the bail
[00:12:14.584 --> 00:12:23.207]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:12:23.427 --> 00:12:29.549]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:12:29.809 --> 00:12:33.190]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:37.551]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:12:45.683 --> 00:12:46.144]  I think so.
[00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:02.503]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:08.869]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[00:13:37.228 --> 00:13:40.949]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.854]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:14:11.374 --> 00:14:17.578]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:14:17.798 --> 00:14:19.699]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:22.241]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:33.188]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:14:35.493 --> 00:14:36.754]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:37.154 --> 00:14:38.555]  It's about a one world government.
[00:14:39.015 --> 00:14:45.358]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:14:54.182 --> 00:14:55.343]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:55.763 --> 00:14:56.944]  The people strike back.
[00:14:59.904 --> 00:15:10.206]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:15:11.086 --> 00:15:16.567]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:19.788]  Starve or surrender.
[00:15:19.848 --> 00:15:25.409]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:15:25.889 --> 00:15:26.509]  What then?
[00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:31.071]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:15:31.351 --> 00:15:35.534]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.

[00:16:05.912 --> 00:16:30.667]  You know, I saw this Austin American Statesman story online, front page of Metro and State, strip search of eight-year-old girl that we've been exposing.
[00:16:33.103 --> 00:16:50.799]  But then, it's a different version, I guess, they went to print later than the internet story they put out, they admit the police contradicted themselves with the school administration, because the school administration admitted they took her pants off, and they admitted that to us, and the CPS admitted it, and then now they're denying it, saying nobody did.
[00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:53.241]  I mean, you know, you guys just...
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.002]  It's not good to lie continually.
[00:16:57.022 --> 00:16:58.143]  I mean, come on!
[00:16:58.763 --> 00:16:59.944]  We're not the ones lying.
[00:16:59.964 --> 00:17:00.785]  You're the ones lying.
[00:17:01.265 --> 00:17:03.827]  Like they've now had to admit, I didn't give out their 911 number.
[00:17:03.887 --> 00:17:05.989]  I gave out the administrative county numbers.
[00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.571]  So they've been caught in that lie as well.
[00:17:08.651 --> 00:17:10.132]  But look, just keep lying.
[00:17:10.312 --> 00:17:11.593]  Everybody knows who the liars are.
[00:17:11.994 --> 00:17:12.254]  You.
[00:17:12.674 --> 00:17:13.075]  Not us.
[00:17:13.915 --> 00:17:14.856]  Does that mean we're perfect?
[00:17:15.276 --> 00:17:15.436]  No.
[00:17:15.476 --> 00:17:16.117]  We make mistakes.
[00:17:16.157 --> 00:17:19.580]  But you guys are known that when your lips are moving, you're lying.
[00:17:20.981 --> 00:17:23.002]  Going back to Tony Gosling of Bilderberg.org.
[00:17:23.903 --> 00:17:30.147]  We can also learn more about the Bilderberg in my film, The Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:17:30.607 --> 00:17:39.933]  Okay, in a nutshell, the founding of Bilderberg, from the documents themselves, and then the latest info, any intel you've gotten from this year's meeting, what's on the agenda from 2009?
[00:17:39.973 --> 00:17:46.997]  The list this year, Alex, is the Bilderberg press release, have you?
[00:17:47.677 --> 00:17:47.898]  Yes.
[00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:49.939]  You've seen all that then, yeah?
[00:17:51.024 --> 00:17:53.827]  Well, we got their press release, and yeah, we put it up, yeah.
[00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:54.688]  Okay, brilliant.
[00:17:55.568 --> 00:18:13.445]  Because there were a couple of issues of the press release, some in different languages, but yeah, I mean, they were talking this time, or at least they say they were talking about the financial crisis, governments and markets, role of institutions, market economies and democracy, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, U.S.
[00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:15.227]  and the world, cyber-terrorism,
[00:18:16.271 --> 00:18:21.994]  Which I guess is their fear of the truth coming out on the internet, manifesting as something called cyber-terrorism.
[00:18:22.994 --> 00:18:25.915]  New imperialisms, protectionism, post-Kyoto challenges.
[00:18:25.955 --> 00:18:31.077]  Now, I don't know about you, but that's the longest list of subjects I've ever seen on one of these Bilderberg press releases.
[00:18:31.478 --> 00:18:43.062]  And of course, the Bilderberg-style answer to all this is, all these international problems need to be dealt with together by a giant, global, governmental-type system.
[00:18:43.082 --> 00:18:44.203]  I mean, that's where they're pushing.
[00:18:45.055 --> 00:18:53.620]  But it seems every time there's some kind of crisis, and this is why they're so into these creative crises, is they're trying to pull it in and say, it's okay, we've got a plan to deal with it.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.962]  A little bit like when they appeared at the beginning of the Second World War.
[00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:59.703]  They were sort of jumping in there saying, it's okay, we'll deal with it.
[00:19:00.544 --> 00:19:06.347]  So they're spending a lot of money, a lot of time and effort trying to think ahead of the game and playing a long game.
[00:19:07.107 --> 00:19:08.668]  As I think, you know, we need to do too.
[00:19:09.869 --> 00:19:18.091]  So, the originals, when we were talking a little bit earlier about the U-Boat incident, do you actually know about that?
[00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:21.211]  Where Hitler's escape boat, do you know about that one?
[00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:26.672]  Yes, I had read briefly about it in a few history books, but you had more details, so tell us about it.
[00:19:26.692 --> 00:19:27.232]  Well, that's right.
[00:19:27.252 --> 00:19:33.653]  I mean, I actually came over to the States, I think it was in 1999, to check this one out, Alex, because it seemed so intriguing.
[00:19:33.693 --> 00:19:38.014]  I was having chats on the phone and getting emails from a guy called Ed Michal,
[00:19:39.207 --> 00:19:51.756]  I think it's in Concord, Massachusetts, he's based, but he was doing diving off of Cape Cod, and he's someone that kind of does research in libraries, museums, and that kind of thing, into wrecks.
[00:19:52.276 --> 00:19:57.980]  And he discovered this wreck, this U-boat, which has sunk off Cape Cod on the 25th of August, 1944.
[00:20:00.398 --> 00:20:04.959]  It was a very special, very peculiar type of U-boat.
[00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:07.140]  Only one of its kind was ever built.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.280]  It's called a Type X-1B.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:17.802]  You won't find it in any of the books that are published about submarines, but he's managed to get the plans for it, all sorts of stuff.
[00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:28.825]  But it was only one ever built, and it was in port in Danzig, sitting there, waiting for any reason that Hitler or the high command of the German
[00:20:29.301 --> 00:20:29.761]  We're good to go.
[00:20:59.953 --> 00:21:11.502]  Because what Ed believed was that towards the end of the war the Nazis started shipping their gold into the U-Boat so that Hitler could escape with the gold across the Atlantic or wherever he wanted to go underwater.
[00:21:11.522 --> 00:21:14.845]  Well we know a lot of it went to Central and South America.
[00:21:15.165 --> 00:21:23.031]  That's on record that massive amounts of gold, diamonds, artwork and Nazis went to Argentina, you name it.
[00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:30.711]  And I don't think a submarine would be the best way of transporting gold around the world, but I think it certainly makes it an intriguing prospect.
[00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:36.073]  Well, see, the Germans had the big milk cows, is what they called them.
[00:21:37.533 --> 00:21:40.134]  Large, troop-carrying, cargo-carrying subs.
[00:21:40.554 --> 00:21:44.936]  And we know milk cows went to South America, carrying all the goodies.
[00:21:45.456 --> 00:21:46.556]  Stay there, Tony Gosling.
[00:21:46.576 --> 00:21:48.737]  Let's fast forward when we get back to current times.
[00:21:49.637 --> 00:21:50.557]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.037 --> 00:21:52.538]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.554 --> 00:21:56.345]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:56.988 --> 00:21:57.610]  Goodies!
[00:21:59.335 --> 00:22:07.698]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:22:07.978 --> 00:22:12.380]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:18.062]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[00:22:49.634 --> 00:22:53.357]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:53.497 --> 00:23:00.103]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:23:13.098 --> 00:23:19.304]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:19.684 --> 00:23:21.526]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:24.088]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:24.168 --> 00:23:35.118]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:23:35.739 --> 00:23:37.020]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:38.782]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:23:39.258 --> 00:23:45.626]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:56.018 --> 00:23:57.220]  The people strike back.
[00:23:59.346 --> 00:24:03.610]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:08.754]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:24:08.974 --> 00:24:10.295]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:24:10.475 --> 00:24:13.958]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:24:59.233 --> 00:25:03.394]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride, with sword and pistol by my side.
[00:25:16.383 --> 00:25:22.925]  Hey, zoom in on that, folks, on the computer screen.
[00:25:22.945 --> 00:25:25.705]  The people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:25:26.405 --> 00:25:31.787]  Yeah, that's the front page of the Galveston County Daily News.
[00:25:33.487 --> 00:25:34.607]  People protesting
[00:25:46.226 --> 00:25:47.466]  Taser is killing people.
[00:25:48.067 --> 00:25:52.908]  The guy leading the march is wearing the answer to 1984 1776 t-shirt.
[00:25:53.308 --> 00:25:56.950]  That's exactly what these t-shirts are meant.
[00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:01.951]  They're our colors, our uniform, and the fight for freedom and to meet like-minded people.
[00:26:07.653 --> 00:26:09.254]  But I'm living still.
[00:26:09.574 --> 00:26:13.855]  Alright, we just, we gotta go back to our guest.
[00:26:13.876 --> 00:26:15.016]  We gotta cut off, uh,
[00:26:17.372 --> 00:26:18.153]  Waylon Jennings.
[00:26:18.173 --> 00:26:20.574]  Now that would be a crime.
[00:26:20.634 --> 00:26:21.155]  Crank him up!
[00:26:37.631 --> 00:26:42.032]  And then it's a crime to cut off Johnny Cash coming up.
[00:26:42.112 --> 00:26:45.553]  But we have to do it.
[00:26:45.573 --> 00:26:49.674]  Guess Johnny doesn't get his.
[00:26:52.015 --> 00:26:54.056]  I'd rather just sit around all day listening to music, wouldn't you?
[00:26:54.076 --> 00:26:56.476]  Maybe on a bass boat fishing.
[00:26:56.496 --> 00:26:58.217]  We gotta fight the new world order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:58.237 --> 00:26:59.397]  There will be no future.
[00:27:00.977 --> 00:27:02.298]  I fly a starship.
[00:27:04.434 --> 00:27:05.317]  Let's go back to Tony.
[00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:07.564]  Gosling, Bilderberg.org.
[00:27:08.306 --> 00:27:08.868]  Okay, Tony.
[00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:11.583]  Other interesting history, though.
[00:27:11.703 --> 00:27:19.247]  I mean, it's now out in mainline news that it was Nazi money helping to found it, kind of merging with the British and U.S.
[00:27:19.647 --> 00:27:20.107]  elites.
[00:27:21.088 --> 00:27:22.269]  How is their agenda going?
[00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:33.135]  According to Jim Tucker and Daniel Estillan and so many others that have sources inside, it is not going well, and that they realize that people are waking up to the new world order.
[00:27:33.255 --> 00:27:36.256]  Is that what you've got?
[00:27:36.276 --> 00:27:39.018]  Because I know you have a lot of contacts, do constant research.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:40.520]  I know.
[00:27:41.441 --> 00:27:46.345]  I think essentially what they're working to is a two-pronged failure, really.
[00:27:46.425 --> 00:27:48.347]  One is a failed plan in the first place.
[00:27:48.687 --> 00:27:54.032]  I mean, a lot of these plans were drawn up, you know, many, many, many years ago, and they just don't work in the modern world.
[00:27:54.332 --> 00:28:07.343]  The other thing, of course, is it's a little bit like the Battle of Arnhem in the Second World War, when the gliders came in as part of a kind of large paratroop invasion.
[00:28:07.993 --> 00:28:11.794]  The first thing the Germans got their hands on was the plans.
[00:28:12.236 --> 00:28:17.278]  Now this is what we've got as well, is we've got a lot of the plans of what they're intending to do.
[00:28:17.298 --> 00:28:21.239]  I mean, not necessarily the individual operational details, but the larger plan.
[00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:24.760]  We've got it, it's come out before... We have the blueprints of the Death Star!
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:31.782]  We have the blueprints of the Death Star, and if we will just mount an X-Wing attack, we can beat them, and we have done that.
[00:28:32.342 --> 00:28:37.864]  And of course, this is really, ultimately, is going to be, and is already, a massive battle for hearts and minds.
[00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.952]  And of course, if the hearts and minds are on the case before the battle starts, then there's no chance of taking them away.
[00:28:44.833 --> 00:28:49.215]  So I think this is a sort of meta looking at this whole thing from afar.
[00:28:50.675 --> 00:28:59.459]  Yes, of course, the Builderbirds have got some serious problems and they've got some even bigger problems after this year's conference because it was really the first time I've ever seen a mainstream
[00:29:00.297 --> 00:29:09.859]  Uh... British uh... newspaper or TV do a really good in-depth analysis and coverage and and Charlie Skelton's pieces on the Guardian online.
[00:29:09.879 --> 00:29:11.199]  I'm sure you've been following those Alex.
[00:29:11.239 --> 00:29:11.919]  We've had him on.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:23.462]  Yep, absolutely fantastic and uh... this is the first and isn't it interesting that we see the Guardian as a left paper as the first one to really uh... stick the knife into Bilderberg.
[00:29:26.662 --> 00:29:29.443]  Now uh... Nomi go ahead.
[00:29:30.137 --> 00:29:45.780]  Yeah, because for me, I've come from a reasonably left-wing trade union background and I've always thought that the biggest thorn in these people's sides is organised labour, well organised and representative.
[00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:56.281]  On a program I do here this evening in Bristol, we had a guy from the Communication Workers' Union, which represents the telecom workers and postal workers in the southwest of England.
[00:29:56.421 --> 00:29:59.844]  This one chap is representing 30,000 workers.
[00:29:59.924 --> 00:30:04.929]  I think this is really what the Bilderbergers fear, almost more than anything else, is organised
[00:30:05.598 --> 00:30:05.878]  Ordinary
[00:30:21.732 --> 00:30:21.852]  That's
[00:30:39.085 --> 00:30:48.934]  You know, one strength they have is they stick with the same plan and don't give up, but that's also a weakness when you're carrying it out over 50, 60 years, because despite all their great wealth, we have their plans.
[00:30:50.295 --> 00:30:53.438]  Their plan wasn't set up and designed for this hyper-modern world.
[00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:56.921]  The control grids they tried to build have kind of backfired on them.
[00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:03.347]  Answer that question, and then finally, take Charlie Skelton, The Guardian reporter, take the other reporters.
[00:31:03.367 --> 00:31:05.149]  They arrested a whole bunch of people from
[00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:07.309]  Portuguese news and U.S.
[00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:16.851]  news and British news, and if they were smart, they'd just meet and not act like it was a big deal, but still, you know, have it be closed door.
[00:31:17.311 --> 00:31:19.692]  Instead, they enjoy having people arrested.
[00:31:19.712 --> 00:31:21.252]  They enjoy having the army out.
[00:31:21.272 --> 00:31:26.813]  They enjoy shutting things down for two and a half miles in the middle of a giant tourist area and arresting tourists.
[00:31:26.853 --> 00:31:30.514]  I mean, isn't their arrogance, their hubris going to be their downfall?
[00:31:31.147 --> 00:31:35.749]  Well, I think that is actually a massive tactical error on their side.
[00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:44.314]  Because their hotel is sealed off well away from anybody, they are actually showing their hand by acting like that.
[00:31:44.474 --> 00:31:47.615]  And this is one of the reasons, I think, why Charlie was so annoyed.
[00:31:47.656 --> 00:31:52.058]  Now, I don't know if Charlie mentioned it, but also the Times covered it as well this year.
[00:31:53.198 --> 00:32:00.182]  To see the way these newspapers operate in this kind of masquerade of competition,
[00:32:00.723 --> 00:32:11.090]  Knowing Murdoch's outlets, Sky News, The Times, The Sun, etc., is that they only act and they only do stuff when somebody else is doing it.
[00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:16.794]  And this is what they're making out, that they're actually also interested in covering this stuff.
[00:32:16.814 --> 00:32:21.177]  But you can be guaranteed, if The Guardian hadn't been covering it, there would not have been a word in The Times about it.
[00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:30.283]  The other newspaper that covered it here in Britain was the Sunday Express, which did a fantastic little piece calling them the Bilderberg Illuminati.
[00:32:30.343 --> 00:32:36.006]  So this is for, certainly in the English language newspapers, this is the best year I've ever seen for Bilderberg coverage.
[00:32:36.614 --> 00:32:40.678]  Antonio, that leads me to my next point that I'm going to cover after you're gone, but I want you to comment on this now.
[00:32:41.078 --> 00:32:42.800]  So we have this weird paradox.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:54.170]  All these decades they've said we're crazy, it doesn't exist, there's no Anglo-American slash Germanic elite with this Israeli banking elite mixed in.
[00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:59.094]  None of this exists, it isn't real, you're crazy if you talk about it.
[00:33:00.215 --> 00:33:01.716]  And I know I just called you Charlie.
[00:33:02.356 --> 00:33:02.937]  I know it's Tony.
[00:33:03.157 --> 00:33:04.797]  I was thinking about Charlie and what happened to him.
[00:33:05.518 --> 00:33:06.118]  Let me start over.
[00:33:06.678 --> 00:33:10.380]  We have, Tony Gosling, this paradox.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.381]  They've denied there's this global elite.
[00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:14.522]  They've denied there's this new world order.
[00:33:15.082 --> 00:33:18.344]  And now, so many of these documents have been declassified.
[00:33:18.644 --> 00:33:22.866]  The globalists are out in the open saying, yes, the answer to the world crisis is a new world order.
[00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:25.808]  You'll pay your taxes to private bankers.
[00:33:26.528 --> 00:33:48.071]  I mean, all of this is now being admitted, but then still you have the mainline media, even in the same publications, they'll admit there's a global New World Order and define it just as we've defined it, but then have a separate article in the New York Times saying it doesn't exist and we're insane, and so it's really kind of like a train wreck.
[00:33:49.008 --> 00:33:52.911]  To watch them not getting their propaganda lined up.
[00:33:52.931 --> 00:33:54.772]  I mean, do you see the point I'm making?
[00:33:54.812 --> 00:33:57.594]  They're denying something which they have to now admit?
[00:33:58.114 --> 00:34:04.739]  Well, listen, this is a massive catch-up is called for here right across the Western English-speaking, particularly, media.
[00:34:05.259 --> 00:34:09.482]  I mean, there is a kind of two-pronged problem in that.
[00:34:09.622 --> 00:34:11.663]  One is that you do have censorship.
[00:34:11.784 --> 00:34:18.148]  Certainly, places like Reuters, as Charlie showed, you know, you type Bilderberg into Reuters and nothing comes up whatsoever.
[00:34:18.601 --> 00:34:25.964]  You know, so you've got some sort of censorship, and I know for a fact, I've seen Bilderberg articles on the Reuters system, you know, so they've obviously hidden these articles.
[00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.985]  They've removed them!
[00:34:28.405 --> 00:34:30.686]  But there's also quite genuine ignorance.
[00:34:30.866 --> 00:34:41.250]  I mean, when I speak to journalists about Bilderberg, and I'm sort of known in the UK amongst other journos as a place to come to talk to Bilderberg, about Bilderberg, there's only two different reactions.
[00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:44.971]  One is looking at me as if I'm slightly crazy, and the other one
[00:34:45.422 --> 00:34:47.164]  Or else, you know, or else good.
[00:34:47.324 --> 00:34:52.428]  You know, so there's a knowledge there, so they're either for it or against it, or whatever.
[00:34:52.468 --> 00:34:53.449]  There's very much a knowledge.
[00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.052]  But most journalists actually haven't heard about this.
[00:34:56.472 --> 00:35:01.477]  We're talking about ordinary journos who are working on other stories, such as, you know, sports and all that sort of thing.
[00:35:01.497 --> 00:35:07.442]  It's just not, and news journalists, or domestic stuff, it's not in the consciousness of journalists.
[00:35:07.502 --> 00:35:08.563]  And this is what we're seeing.
[00:35:09.022 --> 00:35:13.104]  is the sort of problems as they're coming out of the closet.
[00:35:13.124 --> 00:35:21.588]  Because of course, as you said rightly, for years and years they've been denying it and now all of a sudden we're hearing all this, oh we need a global solution, we need a global solution, we need a global solution.
[00:35:22.029 --> 00:35:31.934]  So what's happening is, I think what certainly the journalists I talk to is they're slowly realising, wow, this is massive and it's been brewing under the surface for years.
[00:35:32.294 --> 00:35:36.316]  And of course the trust that Bilderberg have constantly insisted on
[00:35:36.866 --> 00:35:38.367]  Well that was my next point is that
[00:35:56.744 --> 00:36:06.988]  This is a huge loss of trust happening as the mainstream media invested itself making fun of us and saying, Limbaugh used to say the CFR didn't exist.
[00:36:07.088 --> 00:36:12.911]  Now it's all over TV pushing open world government as the solution, you know, to all problems.
[00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:20.854]  Denying Bilderberg, denying North American Union, denying NAFTA superhighways as they're being built, the billboards are up.
[00:36:22.194 --> 00:36:25.736]  Because they've done this and because the media itself
[00:36:27.357 --> 00:36:31.280]  A lot of the time was actually just ignorant, as you were saying, and their editors were lying to them.
[00:36:31.641 --> 00:36:32.621]  Oh, don't do a story on that.
[00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:35.224]  That's just schizophrenic crazies who believe in space aliens.
[00:36:36.004 --> 00:36:47.815]  That whole line is now imploding, and so the media is losing that much more credibility, and then they're trying to play catch-up, and that only exposes the fact they covered this up that much more.
[00:36:48.695 --> 00:36:50.357]  Well, this is the Guardian's line, isn't it?
[00:36:50.377 --> 00:36:51.458]  And I think what they've done here
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:37:03.390]  If they've been mulling this over for years, a lot of Guardian people, you know, have been looking at this thinking, hang on a minute, this is a sort of fascist conspiracy against Britain, and is this something we should take seriously and deal with?
[00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:12.217]  And it seems to me, at last, they've bit the bullet and grasped the nettle, and they've decided, look, we are going to actually fund and send a reporter there to get the gen.
[00:37:12.237 --> 00:37:14.699]  I mean, the Guardian is really shining at the moment.
[00:37:14.719 --> 00:37:19.103]  I don't know if you've been following all this massive MPs expenses scandal here in Britain, have you?
[00:37:19.997 --> 00:37:22.037]  Yeah, and they're also doing reports about the U.S.
[00:37:22.077 --> 00:37:33.940]  government torturing children, and they're doing stories about the government being corrupt and Big Brother, and they're doing stories about staged terror attacks, and I think it's a crisis of conscience there at The Guardian.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.280]  I think they also understand we're the future.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:43.902]  Alternative media, telling it like it is, you know, laying the cards down on the table, I think they want to survive into the future.
[00:37:44.162 --> 00:37:48.083]  And people like the New York Times, that are still basically saying none of this exists,
[00:37:48.903 --> 00:37:50.664]  That's why they're going bankrupt right now.
[00:37:51.525 --> 00:37:57.248]  Tony Gosling of Bilderberg.org, I really appreciate you coming on the show and we'll talk to you.
[00:37:57.348 --> 00:38:02.732]  One little last thing, Alex, because this week the Guardian is exposed to the scandal here in the UK.
[00:38:03.572 --> 00:38:09.856]  A hard drive was stolen from the House of Commons with all these MPs' expenses on it.
[00:38:09.876 --> 00:38:16.440]  It was actually stolen apparently by this ex-SAS major who has links obviously to the MI5 and MI6.
[00:38:17.751 --> 00:38:18.972]  Now let me stop you.
[00:38:19.072 --> 00:38:21.074]  I have to be honest.
[00:38:21.094 --> 00:38:21.635]  I get so busy.
[00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:54.459]  That I had read about all the news headlines on Drudge about how they were going after members of parliament for buying $200 dinners or getting a little bit of rent money or something and I said I believe this is a political distraction
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.921]  I said this first hour, start of the show.
[00:38:57.301 --> 00:39:02.965]  I said I believe this is a political distraction because they always love to use petty things to get control of Parliament.
[00:39:03.265 --> 00:39:06.948]  The MI5, MI6 has admittedly been spying illegally on Parliament.
[00:39:07.208 --> 00:39:13.812]  You have the shadow illegitimate Queen's government trying to control the Parliament to do these unpopular things.
[00:39:14.132 --> 00:39:21.417]  You're saying, I didn't know this, you're saying they've caught intelligence people stealing it to use it as dirt on them.
[00:39:21.497 --> 00:39:23.178]  So, go ahead.
[00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:26.237]  Yeah, so this guy is John Wick.
[00:39:26.317 --> 00:39:28.279]  I mean, this is private security companies.
[00:39:28.319 --> 00:39:37.189]  Obviously, when people retire from Special Forces, they set up often these little private investigator-style agencies.
[00:39:37.689 --> 00:39:41.834]  Why is this guy, John Wick, not on the headlines instead of the MPs?
[00:39:42.216 --> 00:39:53.062]  I mean, clearly what's going on here is that the MPs are being dirtied up in rather a tacky fashion in order to distract attention from the billions and trillions that the bankers have run off with.
[00:39:53.122 --> 00:39:55.103]  And, of course, MPs are our representatives.
[00:39:55.123 --> 00:39:57.324]  They're the front line against the bankers.
[00:39:57.845 --> 00:39:59.926]  And they're the ones who have been dirtied up here.
[00:40:00.066 --> 00:40:02.107]  And I think, you know, the implication here is
[00:40:02.672 --> 00:40:07.497]  The security services, either MI5, MI6, somebody like that, is also working with this guy.
[00:40:07.977 --> 00:40:10.440]  But, you know, what a private intelligence agency.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:19.809]  Well, they always, they always use, they always use visor consultancy to run the drills, you know, with the former head PR guy from Scotland Yard.
[00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:25.855]  He runs the drills at the exact same time, exact same places, as the bus and the trains are bombed, on the morning
[00:40:26.155 --> 00:40:27.916]  Of 7-7 at the exact same time.
[00:40:28.216 --> 00:40:30.297]  It's always private intelligence agencies.
[00:40:30.357 --> 00:40:45.945]  Quote, you're going to start a private group and then that's the public payoff they can then make, because it's just a private group doing security and the government's giving you a paycheck, but instead of making £60,000 a year, you're now making £150,000 a year, you know, to carry these operations out.
[00:40:46.045 --> 00:40:47.665]  So my instincts were right about that.
[00:40:48.026 --> 00:40:51.948]  Tony, I'm glad we talked to you from the UK along that line.
[00:40:52.508 --> 00:40:54.509]  But absolutely, anytime I see a report
[00:40:55.009 --> 00:40:59.294]  About a politician that's got a crooked toenail, while meanwhile massive crimes are going on.
[00:40:59.334 --> 00:41:00.055]  We know what it is.
[00:41:00.095 --> 00:41:12.729]  Another parallel example of this is they took almost all the IRS agents off of billionaires ten years ago and put them not just on middle class people making $100,000 a year,
[00:41:14.801 --> 00:41:20.663]  They put it on blue-collar people who literally might just owe a few thousand dollars.
[00:41:21.344 --> 00:41:33.248]  And so not only did they cut the amount of agents, they put the investigators on the very poorest, which of course would bring back the least amount of money, and cut all the white-collar investigators across the government.
[00:41:33.568 --> 00:41:42.772]  So, I mean, you really see it, how they go after some poor auto mechanic who can't even pay his trailer bill, but some billionaire can openly steal everything.
[00:41:44.574 --> 00:41:55.343]  Yeah, I mean it's been a really good week actually for investigative journalism here and it's lovely to see because we've been living through a crisis of investigative journalism with all these newspapers, TV stations, radio stations, etc.
[00:41:55.683 --> 00:41:58.586]  cutting, cutting, cutting all of their journalistic budgets.
[00:41:59.567 --> 00:42:12.778]  Another story that's come out this week, and just, you know, stop me if you've already been over this Alex, but it's five Muslim community workers here in Britain have accused MI5 of waging a campaign of blackmail and harassment
[00:42:13.174 --> 00:42:15.155]  In an attempt to recruit them as informants.
[00:42:15.215 --> 00:42:23.600]  So, you know, basically what they're saying is, MI5 are going to these Muslim community workers and saying, either work for us, or we're going to take, say, you're a terrorist.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.982]  We're going to put you on the list, we're going to follow you, and possibly arrest you too.
[00:42:27.002 --> 00:42:29.424]  Yeah, we're going to send you to Guantanamo Bay.
[00:42:29.524 --> 00:42:35.107]  I did see that, and Bob Chapman covered it last hour, but, I mean, we could talk for days about it, it's so important.
[00:42:35.608 --> 00:42:36.648]  Alright, Tony Gosling?
[00:42:36.768 --> 00:42:42.912]  Yeah, I'm just making the point, really, that, you know, investigative journalism seems to almost have kind of
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.281]  Got a bit of a revival.
[00:42:44.421 --> 00:42:48.645]  Last couple of weeks I've seen some fantastic stuff out there and I think we'll be seeing more in the future.
[00:42:49.446 --> 00:42:50.046]  Absolutely.
[00:42:50.066 --> 00:42:51.688]  I mean the corruption's right out in the open.
[00:42:51.968 --> 00:42:54.851]  If we all just stand up together we can overthrow this thing very quickly.
[00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:57.814]  Tony, or I could call you Charlie, thanks for joining us.

[00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:04.375]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food.
[00:45:04.655 --> 00:45:08.780]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food.
[00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:13.346]  During the Great Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[00:45:13.546 --> 00:45:19.774]  And as America continues down its current path, for many, the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[00:45:20.274 --> 00:45:27.643]  With massive layoffs and unemployment at record levels, growing your own food will help you save money that you'd normally spend at the grocery store.
[00:45:27.943 --> 00:45:34.070]  Invest in your family's future by stocking up with your very own supply of seeds available from GetSeeds.net.
[00:45:35.031 --> 00:45:35.311]  I think so.
[00:46:05.248 --> 00:46:06.932]  Okay, I'm not going to spend all day on this.
[00:46:06.953 --> 00:46:13.268]  We've got another guest coming up for just a segment or two and then I promise we're going to take a lot of calls at the end of the show and blitz through some news that I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:20.344]  All right, here it is in the New York Times, and there was some other hit pieces on this film as well.
[00:46:21.184 --> 00:46:28.986]  It premieres the 26th on IFC, and it's on the IFC On Demand.
[00:46:29.006 --> 00:46:32.587]  They're telling me one of the most downloaded films ever on IFC Demand.
[00:46:32.647 --> 00:46:33.567]  It goes up there first.
[00:46:34.647 --> 00:46:36.908]  It says, Conspiracy Theorist Examined.
[00:46:37.668 --> 00:46:40.031]  Few things are as tiresome as the New York Times.
[00:46:40.832 --> 00:46:42.774]  I could talk for hours just about this article.
[00:46:43.255 --> 00:46:49.282]  Again, not because it's about me, the mindset of these people, the attitude, their spirit.
[00:46:50.643 --> 00:46:54.406]  Few things are as tiresome as listening to people rant about their conspiracy theories.
[00:46:55.107 --> 00:47:05.475]  Really, everybody knows it's super hot and that people find conspiracies intriguing, whether they're real or not, and the best-selling books are all about that, and, you know, the new Angels and Demons movie and all of that.
[00:47:05.735 --> 00:47:09.098]  Really, it's... people find few things more tiresome.
[00:47:09.118 --> 00:47:11.220]  This is telling you, oh, it's tiresome.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:18.105]  Maybe for you, a little critic that just watches a couple movies every week and then writes articles for the New York Times, you've never been in the arena,
[00:47:18.806 --> 00:47:21.328]  Who doesn't actually live in the real world, who ninnies around.
[00:47:21.608 --> 00:47:23.850]  And I've checked into this writer, this Nathan Lee.
[00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:24.671]  Talk about a ninny.
[00:47:25.491 --> 00:47:38.381]  While there are no doubt tantalizing speculations to be made about the inside job that demolished the World Trade Center and the nefarious agenda of the global elite, movies about such things do well to involve James Bond and giant explosions.
[00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:40.063]  So, this isn't real.
[00:47:40.143 --> 00:47:41.124]  It's James Bond.
[00:47:41.664 --> 00:47:50.750]  Of course, you should know, twit, that James Bond was written by MI6 slash OSS officer, stylizing real things that happened.
[00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:52.891]  But you wouldn't know that, would you?
[00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:55.433]  Because you live in the world of make-believe movies.
[00:47:56.013 --> 00:48:04.879]  New World Order, an unrelentingly tedious documentary by Luke Meyer and Andrew Neil, follows up a group of considerably less glamorous truth-seekers.
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.921]  So we're not glamorous.
[00:48:06.941 --> 00:48:08.662]  So we're trying to be glamorous, but we're not.
[00:48:10.618 --> 00:48:22.106]  The most prominent of the filmmaker's subjects, the radio host Alex Jones, who is based in Austin, Texas, rails against the powers that be, all of them, in a manner that reinforces every cliché of conspiracy theorist loon.
[00:48:22.126 --> 00:48:26.609]  Because, see, I'm mad about the government kidnapping kids.
[00:48:26.669 --> 00:48:28.830]  I'm mad about lying about wars and WMDs.
[00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:34.894]  I'm mad about Seymour Hersh and the government admitting and the Army's own report reporting that they raped children in front of their parents.
[00:48:35.375 --> 00:48:36.595]  See, I'm a loon!
[00:48:36.996 --> 00:48:37.916]  I'm angry about that.
[00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:38.617]  It's wrong!
[00:48:39.497 --> 00:48:40.218]  I'm just a loon!
[00:48:42.818 --> 00:48:46.181]  I shouldn't be mad the bankers have stolen $14.8 trillion and we're going bankrupt.
[00:48:46.782 --> 00:48:50.385]  I should just watch movies like this guy and ninny around with my friends in New York.
[00:48:51.847 --> 00:48:57.352]  Rails against the powers that be, all of them in a manner that reinforces every cliche of conspiracy theorist loon.
[00:49:00.255 --> 00:49:02.117]  Paranoia, megalomania,
[00:49:03.857 --> 00:49:05.339]  Delusional and sweaty.
[00:49:05.419 --> 00:49:08.204]  Yeah, we were out in the summer in Virginia and I'm sweating.
[00:49:08.805 --> 00:49:09.405]  Ooh, I see.
[00:49:09.486 --> 00:49:14.894]  I know you wear white gloves and have someone fanning you and, you know, sweating is bad.
[00:49:16.356 --> 00:49:17.918]  Paranoid, megalomaniacal.
[00:49:18.854 --> 00:49:29.081]  The documentary's most action-packed scene finds Mr. Jones throwing a major hissy fit when his hotel fire alarm goes off, thereby proving without a shadow of a doubt that they are trying to suppress his revelations.
[00:49:29.581 --> 00:49:34.945]  Yeah, we had security walk up and go, people like to pull fire alarms, but they go to jail when they do it.
[00:49:37.614 --> 00:49:45.299]  And then, they pull the fire alarm, and I go outside, the security head comes up, and I'm outside with 200 people and says, we're gonna F you up.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:57.708]  And there's Secret Service running around all on video with headpieces, and they're trying to blame me for a fire drill, for pulling a fire alarm, that's a serious crime by the way, and I get upset, calling into a national talk show.
[00:49:58.948 --> 00:50:01.009]  On 600 radio stations, coast to coast.
[00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:06.151]  See, to this guy, he's so sheltered in La La Land, he thinks it's fake.
[00:50:06.512 --> 00:50:15.076]  I saw mainstream news articles about this film, New World Order, it's a documentary, where they said, other reviews that have been done, said I made it up.
[00:50:15.316 --> 00:50:18.437]  There was no Bilderberg Group meeting happening in Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:50:18.938 --> 00:50:20.478]  Obama wasn't secretly there.
[00:50:20.898 --> 00:50:21.739]  It doesn't exist.
[00:50:21.759 --> 00:50:23.440]  And that's basically what this says.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.902]  But there were articles that we read on air, other film reviews of this one, it was at South by Southwest, saying,
[00:50:28.582 --> 00:50:29.984]  I'm a complete schizophrenic.
[00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:35.450]  I was at a hotel going crazy in a room, believing there were world leaders there.
[00:50:36.371 --> 00:50:37.252]  Now who's crazy?

[00:51:51.845 --> 00:51:53.787]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:54.247 --> 00:51:57.029]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:03.927 --> 00:52:20.187]  All right, I'm finishing up with this attack review here by this Nathan Lee
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.581]  So he says basically what the other reviews have said.
[00:52:27.721 --> 00:52:31.202]  I am at a random hotel, completely insane.
[00:52:31.222 --> 00:52:36.344]  And there were reviews that actually said this, that I was seeing men following me, seeing men in the bushes.
[00:52:37.344 --> 00:52:43.667]  And at the premiere here in Austin, I talked to some reporters outside and they said, do you really think Bilderberg was real?
[00:52:43.707 --> 00:52:47.128]  Do you think those men were there, you know, with sunglasses and earpieces?
[00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:49.711]  And I said, you just saw them.
[00:52:49.811 --> 00:52:50.592]  Admit it, it's real.
[00:52:50.632 --> 00:53:01.315]  But see, they're so invested that Bilderberg doesn't exist, that when it's in the Times of London and London Guardian and Associated Press, it still doesn't exist and I'm crazy.
[00:53:01.715 --> 00:53:03.956]  You know, we're not being followed, we're not being arrested.
[00:53:03.976 --> 00:53:06.056]  I mean, I've been arrested.
[00:53:06.076 --> 00:53:10.197]  That was in every Canadian paper, major paper in the country when I got arrested.
[00:53:10.577 --> 00:53:12.138]  It was on CBC television.
[00:53:13.809 --> 00:53:18.732]  And they still write articles saying I am a schizophrenic who believes I have been arrested.
[00:53:21.894 --> 00:53:23.335]  I mean, who's crazy here?
[00:53:24.595 --> 00:53:25.916]  Who is insane here?
[00:53:29.358 --> 00:53:37.763]  Because they're so invested in saying there's no new world order all these years that even as they announce it in Time Magazine and Newsweek and everywhere, we still have to be the crazies.
[00:53:40.347 --> 00:53:46.952]  On the somewhat mellower side, Luke Rodowsky, a 21-year-old New Yorker, spends all his free time distributing flyers and DVDs, reporting to Uncover the Truth about 9-11.
[00:53:47.333 --> 00:53:52.016]  Seth Jackson, a relief worker in Louisiana, does his part by heckling Bill Clinton and other dark overlords.
[00:53:52.737 --> 00:53:58.962]  Yeah, how dare him go heckle a president, you know, to bring up real questions about firefighters and police not getting medical care.
[00:53:59.983 --> 00:54:01.144]  Oh, it's a dark overlord.
[00:54:01.184 --> 00:54:02.545]  He's crazy, too.
[00:54:02.605 --> 00:54:03.706]  It's so un-American.
[00:54:04.735 --> 00:54:08.138]  It's been so crazy to go ask questions of your president.
[00:54:08.418 --> 00:54:10.820]  That's like something Gandhi or Martin Luther King might do.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.082]  Oh man, the company this guy's in.
[00:54:13.643 --> 00:54:18.687]  A retired police officer, Jack McClan meanwhile, has retreated to the safety of a separatist militia group.
[00:54:19.448 --> 00:54:25.013]  It's a Christian community in the beautiful Rocky Mountains with their little dogs.
[00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:39.461]  See, this is the distorted mind where they're in their ivory tower insane asylums looking out at us normal people that get angry and have red blood and sweat and care about freedom and we are strange to them.
[00:54:39.922 --> 00:54:45.626]  But I mean, I guess if you go to a loony farm, normal people do look crazy.
[00:54:47.488 --> 00:54:51.231]  We're the type of people, at least we're shadows of them, that founded this nation.
[00:54:51.471 --> 00:54:53.593]  We're red-blooded, we're aggressive, we're angry.
[00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:55.642]  We're gonna kick your butt.
[00:54:56.602 --> 00:54:57.803]  So I hope you understand that.
[00:54:59.424 --> 00:55:02.526]  I'm just glad I'm not, you know, some effeminate
[00:55:03.504 --> 00:55:13.307]  Chicken-necked, America-hating person who just goes around picking and ninnying at other people and attacking people they're trying to save the country from the globalists.
[00:55:13.987 --> 00:55:16.308]  And look, you will lose in history.
[00:55:16.628 --> 00:55:20.950]  The New York Times is going to basically be sold and be a shadow of itself, go bankrupt.
[00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:22.210]  That's already happening.
[00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:25.411]  You guys, you know, you will not survive the New World Order.
[00:55:25.431 --> 00:55:29.212]  Whether it succeeds or fails, you people aren't going to be part of the future.
[00:55:29.232 --> 00:55:30.073]  You understand?
[00:55:30.113 --> 00:55:31.233]  You're all discredited.
[00:55:32.301 --> 00:55:33.162]  You're a joke!
[00:55:33.942 --> 00:55:39.146]  Those of us telling the truth that have had the courage to stand up in the face of ridicule, we're going to win the day.
[00:55:43.489 --> 00:55:47.652]  There's a movie to be made about the psychology of such men, their personal lives and private obsessions.
[00:55:47.692 --> 00:55:49.713]  New World Order merely gawks at them.
[00:55:52.595 --> 00:55:56.158]  Opens Friday in Manhattan, directed by Luke Meyer, Andrew Neil, directors of photography.
[00:55:57.038 --> 00:55:58.780]  And you know, it is, and it's going to also air on IFC.
[00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:08.471]  It is true that, look I'm not stupid, and now that it's about to come out and it's, you know I'll just come out and tell you what I think.
[00:56:09.072 --> 00:56:11.356]  I don't think Andrew and these guys are bad people.
[00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:18.092]  The kind of liberal intellectual set always is above everyone.
[00:56:18.212 --> 00:56:25.236]  So that's their internal appetite, is to pick subjects like with Darkon, the last film they made.
[00:56:25.256 --> 00:56:26.256]  This is kind of Darkon 2.
[00:56:26.917 --> 00:56:29.398]  A weird niche, a subculture as they see it.
[00:56:29.438 --> 00:56:30.239]  Well, see, we're not that.
[00:56:30.459 --> 00:56:31.279]  We're trying to survive.
[00:56:31.559 --> 00:56:33.100]  It's a latch dish fight here.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.081]  We're not just a subculture.
[00:56:35.257 --> 00:56:39.719]  And then they kind of analyze it and show our faults and our positive points.
[00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:42.660]  But it's still done from a position of on high.
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:48.523]  And so the film will be seen by those that hate us as a confirmation of what they believe.
[00:56:48.883 --> 00:56:53.845]  And then by people that love freedom, they see it and kind of like it because they get it and understand our message.
[00:56:54.445 --> 00:56:57.006]  But regardless, it only brings us more listeners.
[00:56:57.326 --> 00:56:57.887]  We win!
[00:56:57.907 --> 00:56:58.527]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:56:59.187 --> 00:57:00.748]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:00.868 --> 00:57:05.511]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:57:05.612 --> 00:57:08.373]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:57:08.574 --> 00:57:11.456]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:57:11.616 --> 00:57:16.339]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:17.500]  If you simply prepare.
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.682]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:57:20.942 --> 00:57:27.828]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:57:27.948 --> 00:57:31.070]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.751]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com
[00:57:36.414 --> 00:57:39.436]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:05.425 --> 00:58:12.470]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:19.194]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:19.515 --> 00:58:21.416]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:21.556 --> 00:58:23.958]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:24.058 --> 00:58:35.005]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:35.626 --> 00:58:36.907]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:37.287 --> 00:58:38.688]  It's about a one world government.

[00:58:54.336 --> 00:58:55.497]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:55.897 --> 00:58:57.078]  The people strike back.
[00:58:59.233 --> 00:59:06.919]  The people need an answer right now for you to bring the hemp back to America.
[00:59:06.979 --> 00:59:11.042]  Bring the hemp back to America.
[00:59:11.102 --> 00:59:14.424]  Bring the hemp back to America.
[00:59:14.964 --> 00:59:18.267]  Don't waste our time any longer.
[00:59:18.327 --> 00:59:19.407]  No, no, no.
[00:59:19.448 --> 00:59:26.593]  The people need an answer right now for you to bring the hemp back to America.
[00:59:27.634 --> 00:59:31.335]  Yeah man, I like that idea.

[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.241]  The leader in alternative talk radio.
[00:59:54.581 --> 00:59:55.102]  Radio.
[00:59:55.462 --> 00:59:55.982]  Radio.
[00:59:56.363 --> 00:59:56.803]  Radio.
[01:00:18.317 --> 01:00:20.799]  Murder and mystery right here in the Valley.
[01:00:24.903 --> 01:00:27.065]  We are under attack from an old enemy.
[01:00:27.085 --> 01:00:28.547]  Find Professor London.
[01:00:28.827 --> 01:00:35.893]  The race to save the Vatican and all of humanity from the clutches of the Illuminati is great fiction on the big screen.
[01:00:36.294 --> 01:00:39.176]  But the powerful organization is no myth.
[01:00:40.317 --> 01:00:42.459]  The Illuminati do exist.
[01:00:43.579 --> 01:00:47.743]  Our modern Illuminati mystery brings us to the most unlikely of places.
[01:00:48.404 --> 01:00:49.184]  Sun City.
[01:00:49.725 --> 01:00:51.887]  The quintessential retirement community.
[01:00:52.267 --> 01:00:55.350]  And among the retirees, a man with a secret.
[01:00:55.850 --> 01:01:01.936]  Paul Marcinkus was once a papal guard, an archbishop, and president of the Vatican Bank.
[01:01:02.376 --> 01:01:03.637]  Oh no, he knew quite a bit.
[01:01:03.937 --> 01:01:09.759]  And what Marcinkus knew is at the center of a conspiracy theory that has endured for decades.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.622]  Attorney Jonathan Levy has been locked in a legal battle with the Vatican Bank for years.
[01:01:15.442 --> 01:01:21.545]  He says Marcinkus is the central figure in the mysterious death of this man, Roberto Calvi.
[01:01:22.105 --> 01:01:25.326]  Calvi, like Marcinkus, was an Italian banker.
[01:01:25.667 --> 01:01:28.488]  They very well were the Illuminati, at least in Italy.
[01:01:29.668 --> 01:01:32.910]  Powerful people behind the scenes, operating in secrecy.
[01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:37.693]  In 1982, Calvi was found hanged from the Blackfriars Bridge in London.
[01:01:38.273 --> 01:01:40.434]  It was staged to look like a suicide.
[01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:58.024]  Calvi was connected to the disappearance of... And we have Dr. Jonathan Levy with us, international law, adjunct faculty at Norwich University in the field of terrorism,
[01:01:59.568 --> 01:02:06.271]  Thunder Levy is best known for his role as counsel for plaintiffs in the lawsuit versus the Vatican Bank.
[01:02:06.692 --> 01:02:07.652]  We'll talk to him in a moment.
[01:02:09.053 --> 01:02:15.076]  The rusted chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun.
[01:02:16.257 --> 01:02:22.500]  I walk the road, horizons change, the tournament's begun.
[01:02:23.502 --> 01:02:29.892]  The purple piper plays his tune, the choir softly sing.
[01:02:30.352 --> 01:02:35.480]  Three lullabies in an ancient tongue for the court of
[01:02:52.574 --> 01:02:55.356]  VaticanBankClaims.com is the website.
[01:02:55.476 --> 01:02:58.838]  Dr. Jonathan Levy joins us.
[01:02:58.878 --> 01:03:01.980]  He's obtained declassified documents.
[01:03:03.243 --> 01:03:08.088]  And hundreds of previously unknown documents regarding a Vatican spy master.
[01:03:08.108 --> 01:03:14.514]  So people want to go inside the Vatican spy system, their international espionage systems, what they're up to.
[01:03:14.954 --> 01:03:22.702]  Well, we looked long and hard to find actually a real accredited expert on this and not one of the myriads of quacks and weirdos out there.
[01:03:22.762 --> 01:03:26.525]  But I think this guy's got some pretty good background and research, Dr. Jonathan Levy.
[01:03:27.406 --> 01:03:29.008]  Professor at Norwich University.
[01:03:29.368 --> 01:03:30.829]  Sir, thank you for joining us.
[01:03:30.929 --> 01:03:37.095]  Tell us, as you know, in a three-minute newscast, we only play part of it, you know, it's not very clear exactly what's going on.
[01:03:37.415 --> 01:03:42.260]  Boil it down for us, and why are you, nine, ten years later, still in a lawsuit with the Vatican?
[01:03:42.981 --> 01:03:45.842]  Well, yeah, thanks for that introduction, Alex.
[01:03:46.002 --> 01:03:49.403]  But, yeah, we've been in federal court for ten years now.
[01:03:49.463 --> 01:04:02.446]  We filed the lawsuit in 1999, seeking return of Nazi gold from the Vatican Bank, and the Vatican has tried every legal trick in the book to get that case out of there, including going to the U.S.
[01:04:02.486 --> 01:04:07.627]  ambassador to the Vatican, going to Condoleezza Rice, and we've hung in there, and we're still continuing.
[01:04:09.013 --> 01:04:20.301]  Okay, well, I mean, give us a boil-down of the Vatican, the Nazis, what happened with the gold, how this ties into the Illuminati, how this ties into Vatican intelligence operatives, would that be the Jesuits?
[01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:23.203]  Right, Jesuits, Franciscans.
[01:04:23.583 --> 01:04:38.733]  In fact, we're suing the Franciscan Order as well, but to start at the beginning, as World War II was wrapping up, a group from former Yugoslavia called the Ustasha, which ran the Nazi puppet government in Croatia,
[01:04:39.618 --> 01:04:52.723]  started evacuating all the gold and loot they had gotten from concentration camps, whose victims mainly were Serbs, Orthodox Christians, and they were welcomed at the Vatican.
[01:04:53.103 --> 01:04:57.004]  A ten-truck convoy of loot was driven into St.
[01:04:57.044 --> 01:05:01.025]  Peter's Square and deposited at the Vatican Bank in 1946.
[01:05:02.906 --> 01:05:03.186]  U.S.
[01:05:03.226 --> 01:05:07.367]  intelligence knew about it, but none of this came out until 1997,
[01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:11.434]  Or 1998 when the U.S.
[01:05:11.454 --> 01:05:30.235]  State Department released information and we followed it up after that point, did the research, got the declassified documents, sued the CIA to get the declassified documents and filed a lawsuit in federal court for return of the gold or an accounting of what happened to it.
[01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:37.418]  Well, obviously the Nazis had robbed much of Russia and Western Europe, the Mediterranean, and just unbelievable art.
[01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:46.124]  Huge salt mines full of gold, diamonds, Rembrandts, and a lot of it disappeared to the US, the Russians, but also as you were reporting, the Vatican.
[01:05:47.365 --> 01:05:55.171]  Continue with your lawsuit, the documents you got, where this money went, where these Nazis went, or these Nazi puppets.
[01:05:56.732 --> 01:06:03.315]  And how this ties in to the Vatican Bank and that news piece we just played part of dealing with the Illuminati.
[01:06:03.756 --> 01:06:19.125]  Sure, to cut to the chase on the Illuminati, how do you move literally tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of gold after the end of the Second World War when you know it's contraband, Italy's occupied by the US military?
[01:06:19.685 --> 01:06:24.108]  Well you do it in connection with some very powerful folks and
[01:06:25.205 --> 01:06:32.830]  People in the CIA, Jim Angleton, who went on to be head of CIA counterintelligence, was involved.
[01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:37.273]  British intelligence, the MI6, was involved with this plot.
[01:06:38.114 --> 01:06:44.358]  And it leads up into current banking at the Vatican Bank, going on into the Calvi murder.
[01:06:46.189 --> 01:06:49.232]  Up into the 1990s with the breakup of Yugoslavia.
[01:06:49.312 --> 01:06:50.494]  Who financed all that?
[01:06:50.614 --> 01:06:52.416]  Who bought the arms for the Croatians?
[01:06:52.636 --> 01:06:53.737]  Where did the money come from?
[01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.511]  But I'm glad you know the history.
[01:07:08.531 --> 01:07:09.631]  That's why I'm researching your stuff.
[01:07:09.811 --> 01:07:11.371]  It's so accurate from my own research.
[01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:13.852]  It's good to find somebody out there who knows more than I do.
[01:07:13.892 --> 01:07:17.633]  I don't know that much, but who is actually accurate.
[01:07:17.693 --> 01:07:27.556]  Now, understanding all of this, I want to go through some of the history of that and bring it up to today, but how much loot does the Vatican have from their exploits worldwide?
[01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:32.197]  I mean, is it true that they hoard a lot of it in Vatican City itself?
[01:07:33.201 --> 01:07:36.223]  That's a great question, and we found out the answer to that.
[01:07:36.783 --> 01:07:41.726]  In suing the Vatican Bank, we forced them to give up information about how they operate.
[01:07:42.186 --> 01:07:44.747]  Now, what they'll tell you is that they aren't really a bank.
[01:07:44.987 --> 01:07:46.668]  Well, it's probably true.
[01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:50.250]  They're more like a fencing operation masquerading as a bank.
[01:07:50.871 --> 01:07:55.593]  Their charter says that they can take all property, movable and immovable.
[01:07:55.913 --> 01:07:59.195]  Well, that's just about everything you can think of, any sort of valuable.
[01:07:59.335 --> 01:08:00.576]  Painting, gold, brick.
[01:08:02.001 --> 01:08:04.362]  Antiquities, whatever you want to bring in there.
[01:08:04.722 --> 01:08:09.923]  The key to getting something into the Vatican Bank is the magic words, church property.
[01:08:10.424 --> 01:08:19.666]  If you can turn your loot, your stolen property, into church property, it goes in the front door at the Vatican Bank and out the back door.
[01:08:20.366 --> 01:08:23.407]  And the Nazis aren't the only ones who have done it.
[01:08:23.547 --> 01:08:26.788]  The Mafia has used the Vatican Bank for years and a fellow
[01:08:27.463 --> 01:08:39.435]  Who, uh, I've been in contact, uh, Marty Frankel, who's sitting in a federal prison in Texas, uh, from, for his part, in, uh, the disappearance between somewhere of $50 million and $250 million of insurance money.
[01:08:40.296 --> 01:08:41.517]  All went into the Vatican Bank.
[01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:49.982]  I mean, really, doesn't the Vatican operate kind of like one of these, you know, the Cayman Islands or the Bahamas or the way the Swiss do?
[01:08:50.022 --> 01:08:54.826]  You know, the Swiss are the armors for the Vatican, historically, are their bankers.
[01:08:54.846 --> 01:09:02.651]  You know, the city of London itself, I mean, all of these little special incorporations all have histories of this, don't they?
[01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:07.755]  But I don't think anybody has a history quite as deep and serious as the Vatican.
[01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:13.734]  Well, they're pretty serious, and the reason is, of course, they have diplomatic immunity.
[01:09:14.374 --> 01:09:30.325]  Archbishop Marcinkus, that little piece from Phoenix was about, lived in Sun City, he was a criminal, he was wanted by the Italian authorities, but no one could touch the man because he had diplomatic immunity conferred upon him by the smallest country in the world, the Holy See.
[01:09:31.445 --> 01:09:33.907]  So that goes back to the old thing of sanctuary.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.584]  Well, it's sanctuary, but it also goes to sovereignty.
[01:09:38.764 --> 01:09:41.507]  Remember, the Pope wears three hats.
[01:09:41.567 --> 01:09:54.481]  He's head of the church, he's the prince of Vatican City, and he's head of a sovereign entity called the Holy See, which has diplomatic relations with well over 150 countries, and therefore diplomatic immunity.
[01:09:55.239 --> 01:09:58.341]  Did you see how the Vatican refuses to pay Italy their power bills?
[01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:01.443]  I mean, I'm not here in a Vatican bashing fest.
[01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:03.284]  It just needs to be looked at.
[01:10:03.664 --> 01:10:07.106]  Is there any idea how great the wealth of the Vatican is, or is that a secret?
[01:10:07.567 --> 01:10:08.507]  Well, it's not a secret.
[01:10:08.567 --> 01:10:14.671]  The Vatican will come out with some phony figures every year saying they're worth about $24 million.
[01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:17.933]  The wealth is unbelievable.
[01:10:19.574 --> 01:10:22.616]  What we've discovered in just suing the Franciscan order,
[01:10:23.363 --> 01:10:50.604]  uh... was that at one address in california at one little address at one monastery in california twenty four different corporations were registered you add that up from place to place and there are literally tens of thousands of entities masquerading as independent entities that are all really the catholic church amazing mister levy I want to come back in the next segment and get into the vatican banker getting hung and
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.641]  You know, you call it the Illuminati.
[01:10:53.721 --> 01:10:57.162]  I mean, is that just another name for secret society or mafia?
[01:10:57.202 --> 01:10:59.903]  I mean, what is Illuminati to you?
[01:11:00.363 --> 01:11:04.285]  Illuminati is a secret society, but it's not just a secret society.
[01:11:04.325 --> 01:11:07.026]  It's a secret society that uses spiritual warfare.
[01:11:07.806 --> 01:11:10.707]  And not just economic, but spiritual warfare as well.
[01:11:12.011 --> 01:11:15.872]  You mean they believe that, or they use their religion to control people?
[01:11:15.912 --> 01:11:16.452]  What are you saying?
[01:11:16.892 --> 01:11:29.315]  Well, I think there is such a thing as good and evil, and as others have said, you know, we look at warfare, and you have political warfare, economic warfare, and there's another dimension, which is spiritual warfare.
[01:11:29.335 --> 01:11:39.237]  And some things are done that are just so evil and contrary to humanity that you'd have to say it goes beyond mere economics and politics.
[01:11:41.724 --> 01:11:46.806]  All right, well, we're getting a window into somebody who's been suing the Vatican for 10 years, since 1999.
[01:11:47.486 --> 01:11:53.008]  He is Dr. Jonathan Levy, professor at Norwich University in the field of terrorism, of all things.
[01:11:53.588 --> 01:11:56.009]  He's been one of the most successful people ever in suing them.
[01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.050]  We'll come back and find out more.
[01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:05.172]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:12:05.968 --> 01:12:11.311]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:12:11.831 --> 01:12:18.035]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:20.156]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:12:20.316 --> 01:12:22.697]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:12:22.777 --> 01:12:33.663]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:12:35.954 --> 01:12:37.215]  It's not about left or right.
[01:12:37.615 --> 01:12:39.016]  It's about a one world government.
[01:12:39.476 --> 01:12:45.840]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:55.807]  The Obama Deception.
[01:12:56.227 --> 01:12:57.408]  The people strike back.
[01:12:59.005 --> 01:12:59.985]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:13:00.065 --> 01:13:04.846]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:12.808]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:18.449]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:25.631]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:13:25.931 --> 01:13:31.253]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:13:31.534 --> 01:13:36.256]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:13:36.596 --> 01:13:44.219]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:13:44.539 --> 01:13:50.782]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:13:51.102 --> 01:13:52.223]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:54.966 --> 01:13:57.867]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:58.508 --> 01:14:01.789]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:14:01.949 --> 01:14:06.031]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:14:06.211 --> 01:14:17.637]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:14:17.877 --> 01:14:23.700]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.580]  We're good to go.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:15:00.744]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[01:15:00.884 --> 01:15:04.584]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[01:15:04.685 --> 01:15:07.345]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[01:15:07.505 --> 01:15:14.707]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and, worse, their life savings.
[01:15:14.827 --> 01:15:15.468]  We're good to go.
[01:15:31.281 --> 01:15:35.303]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[01:15:35.443 --> 01:15:40.425]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:46.167]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[01:15:46.287 --> 01:15:50.269]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:15:50.749 --> 01:15:53.250]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.830]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:15:59.413 --> 01:16:14.999]  You know, as you look at all these different power structures around the planet, I'm going to talk about this once our guest is gone, they all at the top nexus in with other elites.
[01:16:15.039 --> 01:16:22.321]  And I think it's key to see the overall global crime syndicate of these little nation states and these little private corporate systems.
[01:16:22.341 --> 01:16:25.922]  The District of Columbia is its own private corporation.
[01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:26.763]  Now, this is how
[01:16:27.563 --> 01:16:29.745]  Things are done inside the New World Order system.
[01:16:30.166 --> 01:16:35.511]  Going back to our guest with the website VaticanBankClaims.com and big news blitz coming up in your calls.
[01:16:36.112 --> 01:16:37.373]  VaticanBankClaims.com.
[01:16:37.413 --> 01:16:38.274]  Okay, I mean, there's so much.
[01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:43.320]  We've got to have you back up in the future to spend the whole hour with us, sir, and take phone calls, but in the limited time of day.
[01:16:45.109 --> 01:17:00.106]  I mean, there's no doubt the Vatican admits a lot of the Nazi loot went to them, and then you were getting into Serbia and the Croats, who for those that don't know, they were the puppets for the Nazis, and all the stuff there, and then who financed, you know, the takeover of Serbia.
[01:17:00.827 --> 01:17:02.109]  You're saying that's the Vatican?
[01:17:02.549 --> 01:17:03.130]  Break that down.
[01:17:03.871 --> 01:17:04.912]  Well, absolutely.
[01:17:05.132 --> 01:17:13.256]  There's no question that Croatia received its funding from the Vatican or Vatican financiers in 1990-1991.
[01:17:13.536 --> 01:17:26.924]  And that's where we think a lot of the Nazi loot went to, eventually, to break up Yugoslavia, which was, after all, the goal of the Germans, of the Vatican, and of the Croatians.
[01:17:29.225 --> 01:17:30.266]  And why was that their goal?
[01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:32.391]  Well, think about it.
[01:17:32.711 --> 01:17:33.692]  You know history, Alex.
[01:17:33.812 --> 01:17:40.657]  Who killed the Austrian Archduke in 1914 and caused the fall of all the empires?
[01:17:41.258 --> 01:17:46.222]  Well, that was the black hand tied in with the Vatican and British intelligence is what I read.
[01:17:46.402 --> 01:17:50.905]  Yes, but they blame the Serbs for that, ostensibly.
[01:17:50.985 --> 01:17:55.929]  And of course, that's why the Serbs have always been on the chopping block there in the Balkans.
[01:17:57.553 --> 01:18:04.258]  That's the excuse at least, and of course the excuse again for breaking up Yugoslavia, turning it into a bunch of mini-states.
[01:18:05.579 --> 01:18:09.041]  But we aim to see where did this money go to and what was it used for?
[01:18:09.882 --> 01:18:14.465]  And to correct you there, no, the Vatican does not admit that it ever took any Nazi gold.
[01:18:15.426 --> 01:18:18.949]  They'll do everything possible but to admit to any kind of wrongdoing.
[01:18:20.475 --> 01:18:24.118]  Well, they even say Ratzinger wasn't a Hitler youth, though, so it's kind of getting ridiculous.
[01:18:24.498 --> 01:18:25.499]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:18:25.559 --> 01:18:30.943]  I mean, we know, we have an eyewitness, thank God, a U.S.
[01:18:31.003 --> 01:18:41.431]  intelligence agent named Bill Gallen, who was there in Rome, 1946-1947, as a young counterintelligence special agent for the U.S.
[01:18:41.492 --> 01:18:42.913]  Army, and he investigated this.
[01:18:43.053 --> 01:18:49.458]  And he gave four days' worth of testimony and a deposition, verifying everything that I'm telling you today.
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:19:01.309]  Verifying that a 10-truck convoy went in first to a monastery in Rome, where they changed out from British license plates to Vatican ones and drove right in there to St.
[01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:04.792]  Peter's Square, claiming they had church property on it.
[01:19:04.912 --> 01:19:08.855]  And he interviewed and debriefed the people involved in that operation.
[01:19:09.436 --> 01:19:16.802]  Okay, tell us about, there's so many things to discuss, the famous case of the Vatican banker dying and how that ties into things.
[01:19:17.392 --> 01:19:17.612]  Right.
[01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:31.575]  Well, the Vatican Bank, also known as the Institute for Religious Works, has been involved in one scandal after another, and many scandals that we aren't even aware about because they got away with it.
[01:19:33.283 --> 01:19:37.346]  The Calvi case was high finance at its worst.
[01:19:37.767 --> 01:19:40.869]  It involved the largest bank in Italy, Banco Ambrosiano.
[01:19:40.889 --> 01:19:45.613]  It involved operations in the Bahamas and ultimately in North America.
[01:19:45.934 --> 01:19:49.176]  Some people claim it triggered the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.
[01:19:50.478 --> 01:20:05.016]  And it was a purposeful destabilization of Italy's largest bank by a group called the P2, who I think were Illuminati, and one of their many guises, the idea being to take over Italy.
[01:20:06.045 --> 01:20:09.168]  Um, and it caused disruptions worldwide.
[01:20:09.548 --> 01:20:14.312]  The people involved, uh, Sendona and Calvi, uh, both died mysteriously.
[01:20:14.332 --> 01:20:17.515]  Uh, Marcinkus went into hiding at Sun City, Arizona.
[01:20:18.056 --> 01:20:20.778]  And the epicenter of the whole thing was the Vatican.
[01:20:20.798 --> 01:20:23.020]  So it's sort of like the Dan Brown book.
[01:20:25.379 --> 01:20:30.062]  Do you think that the Vatican is at the heart of the European Union?
[01:20:30.122 --> 01:20:33.044]  Because I'm trying to learn and ferret this out.
[01:20:33.524 --> 01:20:37.967]  I know Blair has converted so that he can be head of the EU, that's admitted.
[01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:53.977]  I know that the European Union, they say that is Roman Catholic, and that they want it to be the new center of a global Europe, according to the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.
[01:20:55.216 --> 01:20:57.958]  Yeah, I'm familiar with that theory and there is a lot of things to support that.
[01:20:58.018 --> 01:21:00.840]  First of all, some of the symbolism, even the flag of the European Union.
[01:21:19.452 --> 01:21:23.875]  And of the Council of Europe is taken from the altar at the Cathedral of Strasbourg.
[01:21:24.256 --> 01:21:28.038]  It is those stars, circular stars.
[01:21:29.499 --> 01:21:41.748]  And there was a pre-runner, a forerunner to the European Union called the, I'm trying to think, Paneuropa Union, and it was the same flag except with a cross in the middle of it.
[01:21:42.148 --> 01:21:42.448]  Stay there.
[01:21:42.468 --> 01:21:47.332]  Let's do five more minutes on the other side with our guest, Dr. Jonathan Levy, VaticanBankClaims.com.
[01:21:49.301 --> 01:21:52.291]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:53.254 --> 01:21:55.922]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:22:59.312 --> 01:23:04.638]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:05.138 --> 01:23:12.126]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:12.705 --> 01:23:18.889]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:19.289 --> 01:23:21.130]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:23.691]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:23.772 --> 01:23:34.558]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:35.336 --> 01:23:36.637]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:37.017 --> 01:23:38.398]  It's about a one world government.
[01:23:38.858 --> 01:23:45.201]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:09.634]  You know, I wanted to get Jim Tucker on last hour, but they got him now, so he's coming up in about three minutes.
[01:25:10.514 --> 01:25:24.285]  He was at Bilderberg, he always learns more in hindsight than he even learns while he's there, so we'll get an update from him, and then go to Omid in Sweden, Tex in Texas, Lance in Connecticut, Steven in Texas, Jonathan in Connecticut, I'll at least get to those, get a few other key news articles.
[01:25:25.285 --> 01:25:31.330]  Finishing up with Dr. Jonathan Levy, his lawsuit against the Vatican for their activities,
[01:25:33.933 --> 01:25:43.777]  You know, I've studied the New World Order power structure, and it just looks like every major nation in the West, the East, they're all just run by strong men, special interests, and they all just meet together.
[01:25:43.797 --> 01:25:48.859]  And, you know, we're setting up this, you know, a world system with less and less freedom.
[01:25:49.679 --> 01:25:58.450]  From your research, I mean, are you saying you think the Vatican is the most powerful force in the world, or are you just saying it's run by a mafia, or are there factions in the Vatican?
[01:25:58.470 --> 01:26:03.837]  I mean, because you're quite a Vatican expert and have been suing them for 10 years, and you're a professor, you know, that studies these type of things.
[01:26:04.838 --> 01:26:06.981]  I mean, what's your bottom line view on that?
[01:26:07.521 --> 01:26:13.207]  No, bottom line, they ought to drag the account books out of the Vatican and audit them.
[01:26:13.247 --> 01:26:14.227]  That's what they ought to do.
[01:26:14.448 --> 01:26:23.817]  And if you did that, you'd get to the bottom of a lot of mysteries, including maybe even what happened to Bernie Madoff's billions.
[01:26:24.177 --> 01:26:25.178]  Who knows what's in there.
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:31.003]  Yeah, good old Bernie Madoff, just another case of that.
[01:26:33.075 --> 01:26:34.816]  So, where is your suit going?
[01:26:34.876 --> 01:26:36.436]  I mean, it's getting a lot of media attention.
[01:26:36.456 --> 01:26:37.617]  It's been going on ten years.
[01:26:37.637 --> 01:26:39.737]  Have they exhausted all their legal tricks?
[01:26:40.938 --> 01:26:42.538]  Are you going to prevail, or what's happening?
[01:26:42.558 --> 01:26:43.819]  Well, we hope we're going to prevail.
[01:26:43.859 --> 01:26:49.581]  We're on the sixth amended complaint, which means we've had to amend the lawsuit six times.
[01:26:49.601 --> 01:26:53.742]  Of course, the Vatican has bottomless legal resources.
[01:26:54.562 --> 01:27:02.285]  Right now, the case against the Vatican Bank itself is up again in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, this time on the issue of immunity.
[01:27:02.565 --> 01:27:05.707]  Can you even sue the Vatican Bank in the United States?
[01:27:05.727 --> 01:27:18.092]  And then, the other part of the lawsuit is proceeding slowly, but proceeding, and that's against the Franciscan Order, who were the actual foot soldiers of the church involved in laundering this concentration camp money.
[01:27:18.772 --> 01:27:19.233]  Amazing.
[01:27:19.613 --> 01:27:23.197]  Okay, well, Dr. Jonathan Levy, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:27:23.818 --> 01:27:24.518]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:24.959 --> 01:27:25.239]  You bet.
[01:27:25.259 --> 01:27:25.720]  Take care.
[01:27:26.401 --> 01:27:31.206]  We're trying to give you all perspectives here, and before we go to Jim Tucker, and I want to ask Jim Tucker this question.
[01:27:32.147 --> 01:27:32.667]  I've studied it.
[01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:34.990]  The Vatican's its own city.
[01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.930]  It's above the law.
[01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:37.331]  The Federal Reserve's private.
[01:27:37.431 --> 01:27:39.532]  It tells us on the news it's above any law.
[01:27:40.132 --> 01:27:42.934]  We're now told the bankers are above the law with the banker bailout.
[01:27:43.214 --> 01:27:47.076]  The District of Columbia says they have immunity or are above the law on earning incorporation.
[01:27:47.776 --> 01:27:50.978]  There's all these, you know, the Cayman Islands say they're above the law.
[01:27:51.698 --> 01:27:59.882]  It's just, basically, mafias take over groups or set up organizations and then declare they're above the law, and now it's a bunch of these groups teaming up.
[01:28:00.282 --> 01:28:02.563]  They form the New World Order, so they're all guilty.
[01:28:02.924 --> 01:28:14.769]  Israel, you know, is a private, you know, basic corporation, you know, and there's different people that live there, but the point is, the elites are using it as a command base.
[01:28:15.269 --> 01:28:17.230]  I mean, it's the same story over and over again.
[01:28:18.071 --> 01:28:19.011]  Let's go to Jim Tucker.
[01:28:19.051 --> 01:28:20.172]  Jim, good to have you on with us.
[01:28:21.078 --> 01:28:22.499]  Always a pleasure.
[01:28:22.519 --> 01:28:23.740]  Yes it is, Bilderberg Trilateral Commission.
[01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:53.573]  And of course, as we've said so many times, the Council on Foreign Relations has a clique at the top.
[01:28:53.613 --> 01:28:55.515]  They have 3,000 to 4,000 members.
[01:28:56.115 --> 01:29:11.088]  The clique at the top will handle the Bilderberg propaganda, and what we talk about today will be forthcoming in the months ahead as white papers issued by the CFR advocating those very points.
[01:29:11.718 --> 01:29:18.783]  That's right, every time you have your inside sources, you put out what they said, and then we see the white papers, word for word what Tucker says come out.
[01:29:18.843 --> 01:29:20.264]  No source like Tucker out there.
[01:29:20.704 --> 01:29:23.286]  Okay, in hindsight, what was this year's Bilderberg like?
[01:29:23.766 --> 01:29:27.009]  What key intel did you get that you didn't relay to us last week?
[01:29:27.789 --> 01:29:29.010]  Where is the world going?
[01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:30.991]  Are things going well for Bilderberg, Jim Tucker?
[01:29:32.052 --> 01:29:33.753]  Things are not going well for Bilderberg.
[01:29:33.773 --> 01:29:37.576]  The patriotic Americans and the patriotic nationalists from Europe
[01:29:38.243 --> 01:29:47.529]  Are blocking Bilderberg very effectively, but that does not mean we can let our guard up, because they're still bent on a world government.
[01:29:47.849 --> 01:30:06.481]  They're still working as grim-faced as they are toward a world government, and some of the plans they set forth now would eliminate large amounts of our national sovereignty of our country and that of other countries around North America, Europe, and even the entire world.
[01:30:07.395 --> 01:30:30.413]  Now this year, as we discussed before, big on the agenda was how to exploit the current economic meltdown and the alleged swine flu epidemic in order to create a global Department of Treasury, a global Department of Health.
[01:30:31.133 --> 01:30:36.157]  The Federal Reserve would evolve into the
[01:30:36.855 --> 01:30:48.161]  Ewing's global department treasury, the World Health Organization, would evolve into the United Nations Department of Health.
[01:30:48.321 --> 01:30:50.643]  Obviously, that would surrender great gods of sovereignty.
[01:30:50.663 --> 01:31:03.870]  So, Carl built the long-time luminary, Bilderberg Luminary, also a luminary on the Trilateral Commission, and the former Prime Minister of Sweden, now Minister for Foreign Affairs,
[01:31:04.508 --> 01:31:11.133]  He delivered a major speech in arguing exactly for that.
[01:31:11.994 --> 01:31:20.720]  He said the world economic meltdown is, quote, a once in a generation crisis, while global warming is a once in a millennium challenge.
[01:31:24.663 --> 01:31:28.646]  We are in a crucial time, he said.
[01:31:30.107 --> 01:31:31.128]  The order of magnitude
[01:31:31.707 --> 01:31:34.549]  The world crisis is more challenging than we are used to.
[01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:41.594]  The world economic recession has already reversed strong annual growth rates in many developing nations and in some parts of Europe.
[01:31:41.614 --> 01:31:43.696]  It has the potential to bring down governments.
[01:31:44.456 --> 01:31:50.380]  When we hit bottom, we can't be sure when we'll bounce back up.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:56.865]  As Bill tells Bilderberg, this is an urgent economic crisis unlike anything we have dealt with in living memory.
[01:31:59.137 --> 01:32:03.500]  So Jim Tucker, you're giving us actual transcript from your sources inside?
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:10.124]  No, what I'm giving you is quotes given to me by sources inside.
[01:32:17.774 --> 01:32:18.874]  Okay, it's bullet points.
[01:32:19.655 --> 01:32:25.438]  You know there's 179 now to audit the private Fed.
[01:32:25.838 --> 01:32:26.939]  Is that worrying them?
[01:32:26.999 --> 01:32:30.961]  I mean, you said that they're worried about the anti-Lisbon treaty.
[01:32:31.001 --> 01:32:32.081]  I keep calling it Lisbon.
[01:32:32.161 --> 01:32:34.623]  I know that's the capital of Portugal, Lisbon.
[01:32:35.363 --> 01:32:37.224]  I know they're upset about the Lisbon treaty.
[01:32:38.865 --> 01:32:44.908]  Yes, they're trying to pressure the Irish into reversing itself in a referendum, which is required.
[01:32:46.946 --> 01:32:47.546]  We're good to go.
[01:33:16.627 --> 01:33:18.548]  We're good to go.
[01:33:46.152 --> 01:33:46.492]  I think?
[01:34:04.962 --> 01:34:05.402]  Sure, sure.
[01:34:05.422 --> 01:34:07.563]  Jim, in the time we've got with you, some other questions.
[01:34:08.023 --> 01:34:09.824]  You said this was the most security you ever saw.
[01:34:09.904 --> 01:34:11.385]  Did that backfire on them?
[01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:29.173]  They arrested and detained an American reporter from American Free Press, London Guardian reporter, other reporters, and just tourists two miles away, two and a half miles away, arresting people, and that all these years the media has denied it existed, now it was in the AP, it's in Politico,
[01:34:30.494 --> 01:34:32.636]  It's in even some major U.S.
[01:34:32.676 --> 01:34:33.016]  papers.
[01:34:33.056 --> 01:34:34.258]  It was in British papers.
[01:34:35.039 --> 01:34:44.468]  I mean, the mere fact that they keep trying to be so secretive, it looks like all those years of denial is now backfiring on them and that their heavy hand is backfiring.
[01:34:45.449 --> 01:34:46.050]  Yes, it is.
[01:34:46.670 --> 01:34:47.331]  It's a breakthrough.
[01:34:47.391 --> 01:34:51.876]  I haven't seen the AP story yet, but they have a substantial story on Bilderberg.
[01:34:52.478 --> 01:34:55.202]  Yeah, it was whitewashed, the headline.
[01:34:55.242 --> 01:34:58.647]  In fact, pull it up guys, for folks at PrisonPlanet.tv watching, please, and for listeners.
[01:34:59.148 --> 01:35:06.519]  It was Nationalist Protest Bilderberg, or Nationalist Protest Elite Meeting, something like that.
[01:35:09.676 --> 01:35:12.958]  In fact, just put Bilderberg in and then put nationalist protest.
[01:35:13.018 --> 01:35:14.419]  Greek nationalist protest.
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:15.901]  The word Bilderberg will bring it up.
[01:35:16.221 --> 01:35:16.541]  Here it is.
[01:35:16.581 --> 01:35:17.742]  Greek nationalist protest.
[01:35:18.382 --> 01:35:19.623]  Bilderberg club meeting.
[01:35:19.703 --> 01:35:21.825]  Okay, I was right the first time with the memory.
[01:35:22.405 --> 01:35:24.887]  And it's AP.
[01:35:24.967 --> 01:35:32.673]  Police heavily guarded a luxury resort in Greece on Saturday, where a secretive annual rendezvous of top politicians and business leaders reportedly took place.
[01:35:33.153 --> 01:35:34.954]  That's a first, I think, for AP, Jim.
[01:35:35.174 --> 01:35:38.657]  It is, because AP has been under tremendous pressure all these years.
[01:35:39.332 --> 01:35:42.694]  To never use the word Bilderberg from the Washington Post, L.A.
[01:35:42.734 --> 01:35:46.937]  Times, and the New York Times.
[01:35:47.457 --> 01:35:50.619]  All three of those major newspapers are owned by Bilderberg.
[01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:54.001]  That's philosophically owned because they've all attended these meetings.
[01:35:55.142 --> 01:35:59.464]  Washington Post publishers attend every meeting of Bilderberg since 1954.
[01:36:00.105 --> 01:36:01.666]  And they make their solemn promise.
[01:36:07.527 --> 01:36:09.848]  So doesn't this completely discredit them, Jim?
[01:36:09.888 --> 01:36:12.390]  Because they've said it doesn't exist all these decades.
[01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:14.471]  Everybody's heard this doesn't exist.
[01:36:14.511 --> 01:36:15.452]  Now they have to admit it.
[01:36:15.572 --> 01:36:22.956]  That's A. B. There were a whole bunch of news articles, one in the New York Times yesterday, and it implied we're delusional and doesn't exist.
[01:36:23.176 --> 01:36:28.519]  Other reviews of this film about myself and others, you're in it, it's called New World Order,
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.102]  You know that crew that was following us around for a few years?
[01:36:32.122 --> 01:36:33.343]  Yeah.
[01:36:33.363 --> 01:36:42.330]  There are actual film reviews I've read by major publications that say we are schizophrenic when we were in Chantilly, Virginia, that nothing happened.
[01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:44.371]  There was no meeting, Jim.
[01:36:44.691 --> 01:36:46.833]  We are just complete loons.
[01:36:47.333 --> 01:36:48.514]  AP doesn't exist.
[01:36:48.534 --> 01:36:49.835]  This doesn't exist.
[01:36:50.776 --> 01:36:51.597]  They do say that.
[01:36:52.395 --> 01:36:53.136]  I can pull them up.
[01:36:53.176 --> 01:36:54.938]  It was when they had South by Southwest.
[01:36:55.018 --> 01:37:00.683]  It was like three different major film reviews saying Jones is insane and believes a secret group is meeting.
[01:37:01.024 --> 01:37:03.767]  Jones believes they're hiding behind trees and following him.
[01:37:04.367 --> 01:37:06.810]  Jones is insane, yeah.
[01:37:08.211 --> 01:37:08.832]  Well, they're cute.
[01:37:10.523 --> 01:37:12.524]  But I mean, that will discredit them, won't it?
[01:37:13.004 --> 01:37:13.804]  It certainly will.
[01:37:13.984 --> 01:37:22.808]  And as I say, where it is grows, among the American people, well, you saw it in Chantilly, all those young Ron Paul types of kids out there.
[01:37:22.868 --> 01:37:32.071]  And we had Americans coming from as far away as Los Angeles to Greece to chase down Bilderberg.
[01:37:32.711 --> 01:37:39.174]  And as we said, the number of reporters, as usual in recent years,
[01:37:41.896 --> 01:37:54.659]  Well, it's like when they grabbed me for 15 hours that time and you had to come with the media and get me out of the jail cell, basically.
[01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:57.580]  That blew up in their face and was all over the news.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.660]  There was no coverage of it until they did that.
[01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:11.867]  Well, for masters of the world, which they brag they are in their own minutes, why can't they figure that out, that arresting us is going to give more attention?
[01:38:12.607 --> 01:38:13.787]  I don't think they're very bright.
[01:38:14.808 --> 01:38:16.168]  It must be too much inbreeding.
[01:38:18.069 --> 01:38:22.311]  Jim, I'm not going to keep you much longer, but any other observations?
[01:38:22.331 --> 01:38:24.771]  I know you've got great reports at AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:38:25.492 --> 01:38:27.592]  Anything else you learned from this year?
[01:38:27.612 --> 01:38:30.774]  I urge all patriots within sound of our voices
[01:38:32.532 --> 01:38:49.146]  Tell their congressmen and senators right now that they're going to be pressured to embrace the International Criminal Court, which, of course, would be another huge surrender of national sovereignty to a court that would be superior to our own Supreme Court.
[01:38:50.668 --> 01:38:54.511]  Bill of Rights instructed Obama, as William Wilkie, as I started calling him,
[01:38:56.351 --> 01:38:57.472]  We're good to go.
[01:39:18.109 --> 01:39:26.815]  Now, Obama is one of the sweet-talking left-wing senators in his own party, and maybe a couple of deserters in the Republican Party.
[01:39:26.835 --> 01:39:35.601]  Don't worry, this is going to be done very quietly, with the news that more left-wing Congress is elected in 2010.
[01:39:36.161 --> 01:39:45.588]  In January of 2011, when the newly elected Congress is seated on a Saturday night, late on a Saturday evening, we'll quietly
[01:39:48.258 --> 01:39:51.521]  The city will quietly ratify the International Criminal Court.
[01:39:51.961 --> 01:39:53.863]  And by the way, that just won't kill sovereignty.
[01:39:54.223 --> 01:39:56.825]  The International Criminal Court has no free speech, no rights.
[01:39:57.285 --> 01:39:58.286]  Very tyrannical.
[01:39:59.367 --> 01:40:00.488]  Now, what about Iran?
[01:40:00.788 --> 01:40:06.712]  What about Iran is, because the word is they're talking with Israel about letting them hit them in the next couple years.
[01:40:07.773 --> 01:40:09.174]  What do you know about that from Bilderberg?
[01:40:14.447 --> 01:40:21.829]  is very concerned about whether or not there will be a big conflagration in the Middle East with Israel doing a preemptive strike.
[01:40:22.369 --> 01:40:38.972]  I don't know for sure, but I think they're telling Israel to try to take a deep breath now because they are concerned, of course they have heavy oil interests in the region themselves, that Israel does what is now called a preemptive strike against Iran.
[01:40:39.392 --> 01:40:42.493]  Iran fires back and there's a
[01:40:43.524 --> 01:40:46.585]  A nuclear holocaust in the Middle East.
[01:40:48.246 --> 01:40:50.227]  So they seem to be very nervous about that.
[01:40:51.468 --> 01:40:51.988]  All right.
[01:40:52.468 --> 01:40:55.109]  What about their global carbon taxes?
[01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:58.531]  We know they're getting those in Europe, but they're having trouble in the U.S.
[01:40:58.571 --> 01:40:59.471]  Any word on that?
[01:41:01.572 --> 01:41:11.857]  Well, they're still pressing for legislation they've had pending before the United Nations, unknown to the American people and the public at large for three years or so, to create
[01:41:13.627 --> 01:41:17.328]  A global UN tax on oil that the world has.
[01:41:17.348 --> 01:41:18.629]  Just a penny or two to start with.
[01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:19.849]  You wouldn't even notice you're paying it.
[01:41:20.349 --> 01:41:28.172]  But symbolically, you'd be paying a direct tax to the world government every time you bought gasoline for your car or your lawn mower or oil for any purpose.
[01:41:28.792 --> 01:41:32.453]  And then, of course, over the years, it would be cranked up to a significant amount.
[01:41:32.873 --> 01:41:38.655]  But to set the precedent of a direct tax by the United Nations on the people of the world, that's what's most important to them.
[01:41:38.675 --> 01:41:40.215]  That symbol of
[01:41:43.334 --> 01:41:44.295]  All-powerful government.
[01:41:44.715 --> 01:41:48.679]  Are they worried about the anti... I mean, I know they're scared about the anti-EU movement.
[01:41:48.699 --> 01:41:55.484]  Are they figuring out, we have 179 sponsors to audit the Fed, and at the end the Fed movement is rising?
[01:41:56.725 --> 01:42:04.792]  They're confident they can pressure enough congressmen to block it, but we can hope they're wrong.
[01:42:05.213 --> 01:42:09.756]  They're a little bit nervous about it, but they believe they'll be able to block it.
[01:42:10.337 --> 01:42:11.358]  We all hope they could not.
[01:42:12.068 --> 01:42:16.569]  Alright, folks, you can subscribe to American Free Press at AmericanFreePress.net and get Jim's great reports.
[01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:20.910]  We have a link to the stories he's written at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:28.592]  You can also get his book that we sell, Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, an incredible read of 30-plus years tracking and tracing him, the photos, the documents.
[01:42:28.612 --> 01:42:30.452]  I mean, it's just an amazing book.
[01:42:30.472 --> 01:42:32.513]  Get it at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:35.854]  Jim Tucker, hey, look, it's got to feel good.
[01:42:36.134 --> 01:42:39.935]  Been doing this 35, 36 years and now it's breaking all over the place.
[01:42:39.975 --> 01:42:40.775]  We salute you, Jim.
[01:42:41.468 --> 01:42:42.168]  Thank you very much.
[01:42:42.748 --> 01:42:43.649]  Have a great weekend, buddy.
[01:42:44.469 --> 01:42:45.549]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:47.650]  Come back with a final segment.
[01:42:47.670 --> 01:42:49.951]  You know, we were going to have Jim on earlier, and we got a time zone issue.
[01:42:49.971 --> 01:42:52.991]  So I'm sorry to the callers, but we'll see what happens on the other side.
[01:42:53.011 --> 01:42:54.452]  I got some important info coming up.
[01:42:55.012 --> 01:42:56.693]  Then I'll see you this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:42:56.713 --> 01:42:57.213]  Stay with us.
[01:43:00.854 --> 01:43:06.075]  If we could all see the germs that we encounter each day, we might have a different outlook on how we view our surroundings.
[01:43:06.476 --> 01:43:08.876]  In the past, you may not have put too much thought into it.
[01:43:09.236 --> 01:43:11.197]  But with the current health risks in the world today,
[01:43:14.653 --> 01:43:15.934]  We're good to go.
[01:43:28.809 --> 01:43:38.291]  You'll receive the fogger, liquid concentrate, enough to make up to 32 gallons of germ-killing power, three respirators, goggles, protective suit, and heavy-duty gloves.
[01:43:38.571 --> 01:43:42.911]  Order right now at hazard.com, and you'll receive double the order of liquid concentrate.
[01:43:43.111 --> 01:43:43.732]  Or call 800-675-0323.
[01:43:43.752 --> 01:43:43.972]  That's 800-675-0323.
[01:43:43.992 --> 01:43:44.852]  Or visit hazard.com.
[01:43:44.872 --> 01:43:45.772]  That's H-A-Z-A-R-I-D.
[01:43:45.792 --> 01:43:46.032]  Protect.
[01:43:46.052 --> 01:43:46.372]  Prepare.
[01:43:46.412 --> 01:43:47.172]  Get your hazard today.
[01:43:59.309 --> 01:44:04.543]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:05.337 --> 01:44:10.699]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:11.219 --> 01:44:17.402]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:17.642 --> 01:44:19.543]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:19.683 --> 01:44:22.064]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:22.144 --> 01:44:32.888]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:35.336 --> 01:44:36.577]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:36.997 --> 01:44:38.398]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:38.858 --> 01:44:45.222]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:45.762 --> 01:44:53.547]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:54.027 --> 01:44:55.188]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:55.608 --> 01:44:56.869]  The people strike back.
[01:44:59.671 --> 01:45:02.052]  The new world orders war against humanity.
[01:45:02.633 --> 01:45:04.674]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:45:05.439 --> 01:45:10.802]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:45:11.322 --> 01:45:17.526]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:45:17.746 --> 01:45:19.647]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:45:19.807 --> 01:45:22.188]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:45:22.248 --> 01:45:33.134]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:45:35.442 --> 01:45:36.702]  It's not about left or right.
[01:45:37.102 --> 01:45:38.503]  It's about a one world government.
[01:45:38.963 --> 01:45:45.324]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:45:45.884 --> 01:45:53.646]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:45:54.126 --> 01:45:55.287]  The Obama Deception.
[01:45:55.707 --> 01:45:56.887]  The people strike back.
[01:46:08.899 --> 01:46:10.580]  Well, that was a jam-packed show.
[01:46:16.165 --> 01:46:17.426]  I got some final news I want to hit.
[01:46:17.446 --> 01:46:18.466]  Maybe we'll jam in a call or two.
[01:46:18.486 --> 01:46:20.508]  Maybe we'll go into overdrive and take all these callers.
[01:46:20.528 --> 01:46:21.329]  Maybe that's the answer.
[01:46:22.236 --> 01:46:26.839]  Who knows, but I do want to tell the listeners about InfoWars.com.
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:31.083]  We've added their ringtones on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:46:31.103 --> 01:46:39.309]  You see the banner to AlexJonesRingtones.com and that's a big ringtone Christian company that puts out Christian ringtones.
[01:46:39.329 --> 01:46:40.950]  They wanted to put out some Alex Jones ringtones.
[01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:46.794]  We're glad they're doing it and it's a great way to wake up friends and family because you can hear me ranting and screaming.
[01:46:46.814 --> 01:46:48.356]  You can go listen to all the ringtones for free.
[01:46:48.976 --> 01:46:51.017]  They're at AlexJonesRingtones.com.
[01:46:51.397 --> 01:46:53.978]  Download the ringtones with me and support the InfoWar right now.
[01:46:54.058 --> 01:46:58.040]  Go to the, listen to some of the ringtones like Obama.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:59.500]  We're under attack Mayday.
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.861]  911 was an inside job.
[01:47:01.221 --> 01:47:03.562]  Let your phone wake up people around you.
[01:47:04.002 --> 01:47:07.224]  You want to contribute to the InfoWar, this is a great way to do it.
[01:47:08.944 --> 01:47:09.585]  It's, again,
[01:47:10.748 --> 01:47:11.850]  These are very obnoxious.
[01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:15.234]  And some of them are, some of them aren't so obnoxious.
[01:47:15.735 --> 01:47:17.097]  And it's a great way to wake up people.
[01:47:17.157 --> 01:47:19.600]  So follow the banners on my website.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:21.683]  Go to alexjonesringtones.com.
[01:47:22.224 --> 01:47:25.348]  Also, Survival Seed Bank is just a great company.
[01:47:26.328 --> 01:47:30.330]  We have super high quality non-hybrid, non-GMO seed lines.
[01:47:30.370 --> 01:47:33.111]  The UN, all the Monsanto are buying up the seed lines.
[01:47:33.471 --> 01:47:39.833]  Europe's passed laws where you have to be registered to be able to buy non-GMO seeds and to be able to hold seeds.
[01:47:40.213 --> 01:47:42.474]  We have that Guardian reporter on about that last week.
[01:47:42.834 --> 01:47:44.055]  I mean, this is just getting nuts.
[01:47:44.155 --> 01:47:45.715]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[01:47:45.755 --> 01:47:46.576]  Gardening is fun.
[01:47:46.636 --> 01:47:47.096]  It's easy.
[01:47:47.396 --> 01:47:48.196]  Your kids will love it.
[01:47:48.216 --> 01:47:49.997]  You can do it in a small plot in your backyard.
[01:47:50.377 --> 01:47:50.977]  Start now.
[01:47:51.077 --> 01:47:52.278]  Now is the growing season.
[01:47:52.538 --> 01:47:54.619]  They got stuff that grows good in the summer and in the fall.
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:48:02.323]  877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or survivalseedbank.com.
[01:48:02.463 --> 01:48:06.645]  Check them out today, and I want to thank all our other sponsors as well.
[01:48:09.246 --> 01:48:12.648]  You know, the big issue here is they are deciding to kill the dollar right now.
[01:48:12.688 --> 01:48:15.489]  They're deciding to get rid of the U.S.
[01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:16.269]  AAA rating.
[01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:17.150]  They're just running out.
[01:48:18.163 --> 01:48:23.326]  Our debt, running up the nation's credit card before they finally drop the hammer on us.
[01:48:23.447 --> 01:48:24.968]  I meant to get to this on the show today.
[01:48:24.988 --> 01:48:26.428]  I covered some of it in the first hour.
[01:48:26.849 --> 01:48:41.719]  New terror plot, another government provocateur set up, and then we even have the news clips in this article from back in 2006 where they, the Christian black street kids, they said they were Muslim terrorists that were going to launch a ground war against the United States.
[01:48:41.739 --> 01:48:44.560]  They had no weapons, had no targets, weren't planning it.
[01:48:45.141 --> 01:48:46.342]  It's the same thing here.
[01:48:47.122 --> 01:49:05.773]  Where the FBI created the group, tried to give them the weapons, and they do this to get anti-terror funding, and to legitimize the MIAC report that they've put out, and the DHS report demonizing patriots here in the country.
[01:49:06.033 --> 01:49:09.195]  There's another story here out of the Wall Street Journal I'm going to cover on Sunday
[01:49:10.732 --> 01:49:11.213]  From 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:49:11.233 --> 01:49:12.194]  when I'm back live.
[01:49:12.254 --> 01:49:18.843]  The Climate Industrial Complex World Business Summit on Climate Change opening keynote address delivered by Al Gore.
[01:49:19.283 --> 01:49:27.755]  The Wall Street Journal is the nail on the head here explaining that it's like the military industrial complex but that it is basically a select group of corporations that want to
[01:49:29.551 --> 01:49:33.674]  Shake down industry and business and taxpayers and control every facet of our lives.
[01:49:34.215 --> 01:49:38.598]  So more and more truth coming out in mainstream media.
[01:49:38.618 --> 01:49:43.582]  This by Bjorn Lomborg out of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:49:43.682 --> 01:49:48.145]  I don't know how they let them do that in the Wall Street Journal because Rupert Murdoch has directed all of his holdings.
[01:49:48.185 --> 01:49:49.707]  We've played their own corporate
[01:49:50.327 --> 01:49:51.848]  That's all about to restart on the streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:20.822]  Being restreamed right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:21.762 --> 01:50:23.723]  And please don't forget the free podcast.
[01:50:23.863 --> 01:50:28.465]  It's linked up at the top of InfoWars.com where it says The Alex Jones Radio Show.
[01:50:28.505 --> 01:50:29.006]  Just click there.
[01:50:29.046 --> 01:50:29.766]  It's on that page.
[01:50:30.326 --> 01:50:31.867]  And please keep spreading the word about the show.
[01:50:31.907 --> 01:50:33.188]  We're waking a lot of people up.
[01:50:33.428 --> 01:50:35.529]  People are very fertile minds right now.
[01:50:35.549 --> 01:50:36.649]  So reach out to everybody.
[01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:38.851]  Great job listeners taking action this week.
[01:50:38.871 --> 01:50:39.431]  God bless you.
[01:50:39.871 --> 01:50:41.172]  Great job crew by the way.
[01:50:43.922 --> 01:50:44.523]  The Genesis!
[01:50:44.543 --> 01:50:47.506]  Visit GCNlive.com Communications Radio Network!
[01:50:48.306 --> 01:50:49.087]  Infowars.com!
[01:50:49.107 --> 01:50:50.669]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:50.769 --> 01:50:55.393]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:55.513 --> 01:50:58.276]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:58.476 --> 01:51:00.078]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line.
[01:51:00.418 --> 01:51:01.319]  You have your own bread.
[01:51:01.519 --> 01:51:07.403]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:51:07.603 --> 01:51:10.565]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:10.846 --> 01:51:17.751]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:17.851 --> 01:51:20.893]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:21.093 --> 01:51:21.534]  We're good to go.
[01:51:51.832 --> 01:51:56.529]  You're listening to GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
