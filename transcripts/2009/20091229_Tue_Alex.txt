[00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:09.486]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:11.087]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:11.988]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:16.832]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:20.895]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:46.793]  Well, to say that today's radio broadcast is important is actually to downplay our situation.
[00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:58.555]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours today.
[00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:01.596]  As we approach the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010, the last decade has been
[00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:10.404]  One of intense change.
[00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.425]  Unfortunately, change towards tyranny.
[00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:33.597]  But in the latter part of this decade, there has been a huge global awakening to the true government, to the shadow government, to the private corporate banking elite, who are openly and publicly setting up a technological tyranny.
[00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:35.638]  And so, as a famous
[00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:46.042]  Ryder once said it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
[00:01:46.042 --> 00:01:54.486]  Because in times of adversity, we see the best in people come out, we see the worst in people come out.
[00:01:54.486 --> 00:01:56.227]  Now here's the deal.
[00:01:56.227 --> 00:02:06.592]  I can say with 100% certainty, there is no doubt, it has taken me four days to be sure of it,
[00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:23.716]  I didn't go up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on Friday, on Saturday, on Sunday, and say inside job, but every hour that ticked by in intense research, with myself and my team looking at it, we became more sure.
[00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:32.020]  There is now no doubt that the underwear bombing event is a staged operation.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.862]  Now, we don't know specifically exactly how it's staged, we just know it's staged.
[00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:39.952]  It's like 9-11.
[00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:51.215]  Hundreds of pieces of evidence, each one proving that it's a one-in-a-million that men in a cave carried it out.
[00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:54.516]  And there's hundreds of one-in-a-million events.
[00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:56.177]  Hundreds.
[00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:59.657]  Hundreds.
[00:02:59.657 --> 00:03:02.298]  It blows the mind.
[00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:05.579]  So, looking at this, we know it's staged.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.920]  And I'm going to try to go over this.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.861]  Aaron Dykes has got a great report.
[00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:14.902]  I worked on it with him last night.
[00:03:14.902 --> 00:03:19.243]  Aaron Dykes stayed up until about 4 in the morning to get this up.
[00:03:19.243 --> 00:03:21.144]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:28.086]  And when I read the article this morning, because I was working on it over the phone with him, I went to sleep about 1 in the morning.
[00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:33.803]  And I got up and read his article this morning, and it's a better article than I could write.
[00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:35.144]  I'm not criticizing it.
[00:03:35.144 --> 00:03:44.508]  It's just that then reading it, I thought of literally dozens of other pieces of evidence, and the article actually isn't hardcore enough.
[00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:47.029]  We don't even state our case strongly enough.
[00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:57.426]  You know, there's bullet points in here like there was a man videotaping the altercation in a calm fashion on board the aircraft.
[00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:00.888]  And then he's got a link to the Mainstream Media Report.
[00:04:00.888 --> 00:04:04.671]  Well, actually, when you read the Mainstream Media Report, it was the entire flight!
[00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:05.752]  Everyone thought it was weird.
[00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:11.255]  He was out in the aisle videotaping this guy throughout the flight.
[00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:16.219]  He had the camera on THE Nigerian the whole time!
[00:04:20.063 --> 00:04:22.644]  And then the FBI doesn't want to question him.
[00:04:22.644 --> 00:04:25.765]  The guy videotaping.
[00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.266]  They know who he is.
[00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:39.051]  They don't want to question the families that saw the sharp-dressed man bring the supposed bomber through security and on the plane.
[00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:40.412]  Look at that evidence!
[00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:46.034]  Then you've got him hyping up, wanting to go in to the very country where they're now saying he got his training.
[00:04:49.212 --> 00:04:52.413]  Ladies and gentlemen, it goes on and on and on.
[00:04:52.413 --> 00:04:54.933]  This is an inside job, period.
[00:04:54.933 --> 00:05:00.535]  And I told you they were going to pull false flags, and I nailed it a year ago!
[00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:03.536]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:08.877]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.877 --> 00:05:10.917]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:15.919]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:16.839]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.220]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.101]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.101 --> 00:05:21.182]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.182 --> 00:05:23.383]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.383 --> 00:05:24.724]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:26.245]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.245 --> 00:05:31.509]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.111]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:38.574]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.914 --> 00:05:40.135]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:41.036]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:42.157]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.157 --> 00:05:43.077]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:44.178]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:47.221]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:49.002]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:49.923]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:59.505 --> 00:06:04.812]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:06:04.812 --> 00:06:09.358]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:11.621]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.243]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:06:13.243 --> 00:06:14.285]  There is a solution.
[00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:22.933]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:06.464]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:07:06.464 --> 00:07:08.565]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.806]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:12.467]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:16.769]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:06.307]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:16.144]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:16.144 --> 00:08:18.244]  It is Tuesday, the 29th day of December 2009.
[00:08:18.244 --> 00:08:21.485]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:21.485 --> 00:08:35.450]  Gerald Salente, one of the top trends forecasters in the world, will be joining us to give us trends for the next year, 2010, and the decade that follows that.
[00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.050]  2010 really is the end of the decade.
[00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.471]  That's how Orwellian things are.
[00:08:40.543 --> 00:08:43.906]  Everyone's saying it's the end of the first decade of the new millennium.
[00:08:43.906 --> 00:08:44.727]  It's not even true.
[00:08:44.727 --> 00:08:46.068]  It's just everything's a fraud.
[00:08:46.068 --> 00:08:49.691]  But when in Rome, do as the Romans do.
[00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:55.556]  Regardless, Gerald Sollente will be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:08:55.556 --> 00:09:06.185]  And then I have a surprise guest very close, extremely close, as close as it gets to this underwear bomber event.
[00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.310]  Joining us in the fourth hour.
[00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.691]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:09:11.691 --> 00:09:28.995]  You know, with really bone-shattering guests, I mean bone-shattering to the New World Order, I don't like to... I don't like to think I've got a fish in the net till it's in the net, in the dry well, in the boat.
[00:09:28.995 --> 00:09:34.756]  And I'm gunning it back to shore to skin that sucker and fry it up there on the beach.
[00:09:34.756 --> 00:09:36.537]  In fact, I don't count my fish caught until
[00:09:38.066 --> 00:09:41.667]  The fish is going down into my little tummy.
[00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:46.768]  So, we got this fish directly up to the boat, in the net, going in the dry well.
[00:09:46.768 --> 00:09:51.048]  But I've seen fish flop around on deck and fly out the side.
[00:09:51.048 --> 00:10:05.451]  So... Sunday, I got on the radio and I said, you know, I really wish that the evidence wasn't pointing towards the underwear bomber being an inside job.
[00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:16.374]  I really wish that all the evidence wasn't pointing that direction, along with 90 plus percent of other terrorist attacks.
[00:10:16.374 --> 00:10:19.456]  There are real terrorist events.
[00:10:19.456 --> 00:10:21.957]  There are real Muslim extremists.
[00:10:21.957 --> 00:10:26.859]  There are Muslims who want to kill us.
[00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:35.323]  Just like every once in a while there's weird UFO cults that commit suicide or want to kill people, or there's other whacked out groups.
[00:10:37.287 --> 00:10:44.552]  The point is, though, whenever a real terror attack happens, you don't hear about it in the news or it's barely a blip on the radar.
[00:10:44.552 --> 00:10:49.075]  When you see a staged event, it is always the same M.O.
[00:10:49.075 --> 00:10:55.139]  Because this is designed for general consumption, for the general public that's halfway paying attention.
[00:10:55.139 --> 00:11:03.124]  For anybody that studies this, it is just blaringly, ridiculously obvious.
[00:11:03.124 --> 00:11:05.186]  I told you a year ago with the Mumbai,
[00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.826]  Massacre.
[00:11:07.826 --> 00:11:11.629]  I said that was a British-slash-U.S.
[00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:15.691]  intelligence operation.
[00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.613]  Some connection to Israeli intelligence.
[00:11:17.613 --> 00:11:21.736]  The three groups are inseparable, so it's basically the same thing.
[00:11:21.736 --> 00:11:29.421]  And I told you that because the head of the Indian anti-terrorism squad said that
[00:11:32.284 --> 00:11:38.226]  They had apprehended some of the people, and that they were all Western agents, and it was totally staged.
[00:11:38.226 --> 00:11:40.207]  Well, of course!
[00:11:40.207 --> 00:11:44.128]  And now it's come out in court, and now it's in major British newspapers.
[00:11:44.128 --> 00:11:47.589]  Totally staged!
[00:11:47.589 --> 00:11:48.689]  You ask, how do you do that?
[00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:59.253]  They have special forces go in, dressed up like Muslims, and they kill people in a shopping mall, and then they shoot a few patsies and dress them up like Al-Ciadis.
[00:11:59.253 --> 00:11:59.433]  I mean,
[00:12:01.122 --> 00:12:27.991]  MI6 commandos, SAS, Special Air Services assigned to MI6 were caught dressed up like Arabs riding around shooting our troops in Basra, shooting British troops and shooting people and blaming it on the Sunnis in the Shiite city of Basra to get the Arabs killing each other.
[00:12:30.523 --> 00:12:37.844]  And then they could have the surge lighter stop getting the different groups to kill each other, and then say, oh, look, the violence went down.
[00:12:37.844 --> 00:12:39.105]  Well, yeah.
[00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:44.345]  It's like an arsonist lighting their own house on fire and calling the fire department.
[00:12:44.345 --> 00:12:45.446]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:12:45.446 --> 00:12:47.226]  It's so obvious.
[00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:49.386]  It's so in your... They were caught!
[00:12:49.386 --> 00:12:54.227]  Times of London, Associated Press, my film Terror Storm covers it.
[00:12:54.227 --> 00:12:58.008]  They're caught over and over and over again.
[00:13:04.733 --> 00:13:07.836]  It's constant!
[00:13:07.836 --> 00:13:11.779]  Today I want to go over the different types of terrorism.
[00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:15.803]  The real types of terrorism.
[00:13:15.803 --> 00:13:16.904]  The stage types.
[00:13:16.904 --> 00:13:18.826]  The provocateur types.
[00:13:18.826 --> 00:13:21.108]  The non-event types.
[00:13:21.108 --> 00:13:24.931]  There are events like Gulf of Tonkin where it's just completely fake, nothing happens.
[00:13:24.931 --> 00:13:29.616]  The ships all come back on rotation to the West Coast.
[00:13:29.616 --> 00:13:30.817]  They come back to San Diego.
[00:13:32.403 --> 00:13:36.945]  Captain gets off, first mate gets off, the news media said, what was it like to be under attack?
[00:13:36.945 --> 00:13:38.626]  And they said, nothing happened.
[00:13:38.626 --> 00:13:41.267]  It's all staged.
[00:13:41.267 --> 00:13:42.388]  But nobody took their word.
[00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:51.632]  It was called a conspiracy theory for 40 plus years until three years ago, it was declassified that they were telling the truth.
[00:13:51.632 --> 00:13:59.976]  Two years ago, it was in the Associated Press, Reuters and Chicago Tribune, of all places,
[00:14:02.694 --> 00:14:05.076]  That the Israeli pilots were telling the truth.
[00:14:05.076 --> 00:14:08.599]  You know, they've been interviewed and been on record.
[00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:12.042]  They refused orders three times and were threatened with court-martial.
[00:14:12.042 --> 00:14:12.943]  They said, that's a U.S.
[00:14:12.943 --> 00:14:14.284]  flag in international waters.
[00:14:14.284 --> 00:14:15.084]  We don't want to attack it.
[00:14:15.084 --> 00:14:18.027]  And they said, you will attack that ship.
[00:14:18.027 --> 00:14:20.709]  Because they wanted to sink the ship and blame it on Egypt.
[00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:22.991]  Now declassified.
[00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:26.634]  After all those books debunking people that talked about the USS Liberty.
[00:14:29.867 --> 00:14:32.109]  Not happening or being an accident.
[00:14:32.109 --> 00:14:35.132]  It was not an accident.
[00:14:35.132 --> 00:14:39.637]  And Israel is 100% guilty for that.
[00:14:39.637 --> 00:14:47.425]  But so is the United States to show how criminal it is, to show how these governments all act the same, to show you how systemic the corruption is.
[00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:53.451]  LBJ was in control of the whole operation and wouldn't even let our carrier groups less than 100 miles away protect that ship.
[00:14:54.701 --> 00:14:56.562]  For hour after hour.
[00:14:56.562 --> 00:15:06.489]  It wasn't until the Russians gave aid that the Israeli commandos that were being lowered down to the deck to mop up who was left, they had to then peel off and leave.
[00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:12.128]  And I've interviewed the admirals, I've interviewed the judge advocate generals.
[00:15:12.128 --> 00:15:15.030]  Most of them are dead now, but those interviews are on the web.
[00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.012]  Literally 30, 40, 50, I don't know of them.
[00:15:18.012 --> 00:15:28.878]  I've interviewed the doctor, I've interviewed the first maid, I've interviewed the ship's surgeon, I've interviewed the radio man, I've interviewed them all.
[00:15:28.878 --> 00:15:30.539]  I've interviewed Admiral Moore.
[00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:32.020]  He's dead, died 2004.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.262]  The facts are the facts.
[00:15:39.383 --> 00:15:41.305]  That's your government.
[00:15:41.305 --> 00:15:47.710]  They'll make a deal with another country to blow up your ship to blame it on the Egyptians.
[00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:54.115]  By the grace of God, those men kept that ship up.
[00:15:54.115 --> 00:15:58.059]  And the Israeli government blows up their own people to have political control.
[00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:04.094]  And the Nazis did it under Hitler and the British have declassified that they did it.
[00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:16.382]  Most of the IRA bombings were run by the British as a political pretext to stay in Northern Ireland and to set up a police state in England now used against the general public.
[00:16:16.382 --> 00:16:18.664]  And I could go on for hour after hour.
[00:16:18.664 --> 00:16:20.024]  It's been declassified in 1999.
[00:16:24.542 --> 00:16:38.348]  In Italy, in Germany, and the United States, Operation Gladio, the NATO option, the 1980 Bologna bombing, what, it killed 80-something people?
[00:16:38.348 --> 00:16:41.869]  Pull up the numbers on Bologna bombing for me, please.
[00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:45.350]  They pronounce it Bologna, it's Bologna bombing.
[00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:50.712]  And the, tomato, tomato, whatever, they're the Italians, they call it Bologna, it's Bologna.
[00:16:50.712 --> 00:16:51.853]  The issue here is,
[00:16:56.052 --> 00:16:57.132]  They blew up a train!
[00:16:57.132 --> 00:17:00.433]  85 people.
[00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:02.334]  I was going to say 86.
[00:17:02.334 --> 00:17:04.194]  My memory was once photographic.
[00:17:04.194 --> 00:17:05.094]  No longer.
[00:17:05.094 --> 00:17:05.855]  Like, distorts.
[00:17:05.855 --> 00:17:09.796]  That's why I have to check everything now.
[00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:12.957]  Because at age 30, you start losing masses of brain cells every day.
[00:17:12.957 --> 00:17:21.039]  My once beautiful mind now begins to rot.
[00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:21.439]  All right.
[00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:41.145]  The issue here is, ladies and gentlemen, government-sponsored terror is the rule, not the exception.
[00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:45.027]  Does that not mean that the Iranian leadership are nasty people?
[00:17:45.027 --> 00:17:47.648]  No, they're pretty corrupt and nasty.
[00:17:47.648 --> 00:17:50.409]  Does that not mean Muammar Gaddafi isn't a nasty person?
[00:17:50.409 --> 00:17:52.470]  Does that mean Saddam Hussein isn't a nasty person?
[00:17:53.404 --> 00:17:54.464]  Does that not mean that?
[00:17:54.464 --> 00:17:55.484]  No!
[00:17:55.484 --> 00:17:56.425]  They're all nasty.
[00:17:56.425 --> 00:17:57.645]  That's what government's like.
[00:17:57.645 --> 00:18:00.906]  What did George Washington and Thomas Jefferson tell you?
[00:18:00.906 --> 00:18:02.066]  Power corrupts absolute.
[00:18:02.066 --> 00:18:10.027]  Power corrupts absolutely, as Lord Acton said.
[00:18:10.027 --> 00:18:22.610]  But when you talk about sophistication, when you talk about evil, when you talk about corruption, when you talk about the best at evil, the best at spying, the best at manipulation, the best at corruption, who do we got?
[00:18:24.366 --> 00:18:30.850]  You got Europe, and you got Israel.
[00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.032]  And so it's not some statement of hating Europeans.
[00:18:34.032 --> 00:18:35.552]  I'm European.
[00:18:35.552 --> 00:18:39.315]  It's not a question of hating Jews.
[00:18:39.315 --> 00:18:42.136]  It's an issue of saying, who runs the global empire?
[00:18:42.136 --> 00:18:43.437]  America!
[00:18:43.437 --> 00:18:44.318]  Who is America?
[00:18:44.318 --> 00:18:47.860]  The United States, England, and Israel.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.280]  We're it!
[00:18:52.987 --> 00:19:05.712]  And they're the big dogs, folks, and they suck off the American people, and they suck off the British people, and they suck off the Israeli people to set up this world government, and they fund terrorists all over the planet.
[00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:11.474]  And sure, the Africans, they'd do it if they had the organizational skill to do it.
[00:19:11.474 --> 00:19:16.416]  Sure, the Chinese would play that game, but they're too busy trying to control their billion, 300 million people.
[00:19:17.216 --> 00:19:18.857]  The Indians are smart.
[00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:20.098]  All those groups are smart.
[00:19:20.098 --> 00:19:27.943]  But for some reason, they don't have the knack at the big master 14 level deep chess game that the New World Order plays.
[00:19:27.943 --> 00:19:28.864]  Let me tell you something.
[00:19:28.864 --> 00:19:31.145]  I can see it as plain as day.
[00:19:31.145 --> 00:19:32.466]  I know their game plan.
[00:19:32.466 --> 00:19:34.247]  I know their whole operation.
[00:19:34.247 --> 00:19:35.929]  And let me tell you something.
[00:19:35.929 --> 00:19:38.991]  If you're an American, if you're a European, if you're a Brit, if you're a Jew,
[00:19:40.242 --> 00:19:45.325]  You are fed on even more by these elites than the other countries they're blowing to bits.
[00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:51.109]  Now when we come back, I'm going to give you the latest on what really happened with this situation.
[00:19:51.109 --> 00:19:53.410]  Now they're getting ready for a full-scale invasion of Yemen.
[00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.792]  In fact, it really started six months ago.
[00:19:55.792 --> 00:19:58.333]  This whole staged event is just the kickoff.
[00:19:58.333 --> 00:19:59.074]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:20:01.072 --> 00:20:02.834]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:05.236]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[00:20:05.236 --> 00:20:08.799]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:13.584]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[00:20:13.584 --> 00:20:18.729]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[00:20:19.309 --> 00:20:23.834]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[00:20:23.834 --> 00:20:30.281]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[00:20:30.281 --> 00:20:31.922]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[00:20:31.922 --> 00:20:35.326]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier.
[00:20:35.626 --> 00:20:36.026]  I think so.
[00:21:00.157 --> 00:21:02.338]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.338 --> 00:21:03.178]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:03.518]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.518 --> 00:21:08.559]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:10.180]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:10.940]  Startpage?
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.340]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.440]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.401]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:19.282]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.282 --> 00:21:22.143]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.423 --> 00:21:25.044]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.044 --> 00:21:26.605]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:26.605 --> 00:21:26.905]  Right!
[00:21:26.905 --> 00:21:30.227]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:30.227 --> 00:21:30.808]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:30.808 --> 00:21:32.168]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.168 --> 00:21:36.010]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.792]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:21:54.382 --> 00:22:00.206]  That's startpage.com.
[00:22:00.206 --> 00:22:04.129]  When making important financial decisions you should always know the facts.
[00:22:04.129 --> 00:22:07.691]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:08.512]  Midas Resources.
[00:22:12.298 --> 00:22:13.259]  We're good to go.
[00:22:37.435 --> 00:22:38.777]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:22:38.777 --> 00:22:43.783]  Get the facts and Paul Midas resources toll free at 888-292-2709.
[00:22:43.783 --> 00:22:47.849]  That's 888-292-2709.
[00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:53.236]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[00:23:09.605 --> 00:23:10.026]  I think so.
[00:23:24.622 --> 00:23:25.382]  We're good to go!
[00:23:51.735 --> 00:23:52.475]  Right before 9-11
[00:24:19.571 --> 00:24:24.614]  The media began to hype Afghanistan.
[00:24:24.614 --> 00:24:27.495]  They would show how the Taliban were hurting women.
[00:24:27.495 --> 00:24:35.860]  And they would show how the Taliban had blown up some old Buddhist idols up in the mountains that were two and a half thousand years old.
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:40.743]  I knew full well that the West loves dictators, loves Muslim extremists.
[00:24:40.743 --> 00:24:42.504]  I mean, look at Iraq.
[00:24:42.504 --> 00:24:45.846]  They've now put in a regime that's using Islamic law.
[00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:51.981]  Saddam had been the previous CIA stooge and they set him up.
[00:24:51.981 --> 00:25:03.124]  It's not that Saddam wasn't bad, it's that it's so evil to put him in, to have him do all that, and then set him up and put something even worse in.
[00:25:03.124 --> 00:25:10.847]  And by the way, it's now come out, Times of London, the British government's admitting the latest
[00:25:11.946 --> 00:25:21.131]  Secret documents from Iran that they had special machines to purify uranium so they could make A-bombs was a complete lie!
[00:25:21.131 --> 00:25:22.892]  Of course it was a lie!
[00:25:22.892 --> 00:25:29.836]  Two months ago was a lie that Iran had a secret facility.
[00:25:29.836 --> 00:25:33.438]  They're still complying with global government and the UN.
[00:25:33.438 --> 00:25:38.240]  When a facility is six months out from being opened, they're supposed to announce it for inspection.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.281]  The thing isn't even built!
[00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:46.972]  And the media has a huge hoax saying, look, Iran's got a secret nuke base.
[00:25:46.972 --> 00:25:48.312]  That's come out to be fake.
[00:25:48.312 --> 00:26:00.597]  But a week later, as a footnote, the general public only sees the cover of Newsweek and Time only passing at the bar or the restaurant or at home at night when they're making dinner or doing the laundry and the kids are fighting.
[00:26:00.597 --> 00:26:04.178]  Oh, wow, they do have nukes in Iran.
[00:26:04.178 --> 00:26:07.940]  That's why half of Americans still believe Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons and carried out 9-11.
[00:26:09.727 --> 00:26:11.749]  Even though it's admitted he didn't.
[00:26:11.749 --> 00:26:17.033]  Because they just passively listen.
[00:26:17.033 --> 00:26:18.654]  And so I saw this big buildup.
[00:26:18.654 --> 00:26:20.456]  Here is Osama Bin Laden.
[00:26:20.456 --> 00:26:23.098]  He's going to get you before 9-11.
[00:26:23.098 --> 00:26:24.299]  And I already knew about Bin Laden.
[00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:25.860]  I knew he was a CIA asset.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.901]  I knew he'd been hired.
[00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:31.485]  I knew the Mujahideen had been hired in 79 to attack the Russians to start the war.
[00:26:34.153 --> 00:26:39.117]  I knew that Charlie Wilson was just a front guy when they publicly announced it in the mid-eighties.
[00:26:39.117 --> 00:26:46.102]  That movie's completely fake, by the way.
[00:26:46.102 --> 00:26:49.045]  And... It's just all theater.
[00:26:50.014 --> 00:26:52.035]  And then they massed 40,000 U.S.
[00:26:52.035 --> 00:27:02.681]  troops, 18,000 British troops into Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and several other countries surrounding it, had carrier task force groups that arrived two weeks before 9-11.
[00:27:02.681 --> 00:27:15.427]  Newsweek reported Bush signed the order to attack Afghanistan to launch the operation to begin the preparations to attack on September 10th.
[00:27:15.427 --> 00:27:18.189]  His brother declared martial law in Florida on September 10th.
[00:27:19.531 --> 00:27:20.712]  That was in the Associated Press.
[00:27:20.712 --> 00:27:23.253]  Never before done, never done since.
[00:27:23.253 --> 00:27:31.659]  See, they thought that Flight 93 was going to be going into the Capitol.
[00:27:31.659 --> 00:27:33.940]  And then you would have had real martial law.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.563]  The image of the Capitol dome shattered.
[00:27:38.563 --> 00:27:48.290]  But the happy hooligans out of South Dakota didn't follow their orders and fired two AIM-9s into that remote-controlled aircraft.
[00:27:50.276 --> 00:27:54.119]  That's come out as well.
[00:27:54.119 --> 00:28:04.267]  Just like it's come out, the FBI ordered the firemen to give them three of the data recorders they were found that were sealed under national security.
[00:28:04.267 --> 00:28:05.729]  That's been in mainstream newspapers.
[00:28:05.729 --> 00:28:08.951]  Jesse Ventura actually went and interviewed the firefighters.
[00:28:08.951 --> 00:28:10.272]  Put them on television.
[00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:16.878]  Talk about groundbreaking.
[00:28:16.878 --> 00:28:18.199]  All of this is documented.
[00:28:19.983 --> 00:28:29.828]  And so I saw the build-up before 9-11 and I went on air and I said, ladies and gentlemen, they are going to attack the World Trade Center.
[00:28:29.828 --> 00:28:35.170]  The Feds bombed it the first time, cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, found Patsy's, did it, tried to cover it up.
[00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:42.754]  That even came out in CBS News, New York Times, before they put the clamp on the story.
[00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:48.497]  And I put all the pieces together and I said, I believe they're going to hit the World Trade Center and blame it on Bin Laden.
[00:28:48.497 --> 00:28:49.097]  Their asset.
[00:28:50.256 --> 00:28:52.858]  Now, what did I say when Obama got elected?
[00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:55.440]  What did I say two or three months into this year?
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.601]  Over and over again.
[00:28:56.601 --> 00:29:01.305]  You the listeners, because I don't have the staff, but it's good to show the sheeple this, go find the YouTube clips.
[00:29:01.305 --> 00:29:02.365]  Go find the video clips.
[00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:03.266]  Please, send them to us.
[00:29:03.266 --> 00:29:04.667]  Write your own articles.
[00:29:04.667 --> 00:29:06.769]  I'll get Paul, Kurt, whoever on it.
[00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:19.939]  I mean, I did probably 30, 40, 50 shows, I don't know, where I said specifically, they're going to have mass shootings in military bases and shopping malls, and I believe the shopping malls are coming,
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.141]  And schools.
[00:29:23.141 --> 00:29:27.402]  And they're going to have bombers on planes.
[00:29:27.402 --> 00:29:29.883]  Now, how did I know that?
[00:29:29.883 --> 00:29:33.164]  Because the feds like to play God.
[00:29:33.164 --> 00:29:42.608]  They like to brag when they brainwash local police so the police think that they are omnipresent about what the threat is that's coming.
[00:29:42.608 --> 00:29:46.089]  So that when it comes, the public's ready for their solution.
[00:29:46.089 --> 00:29:47.470]  I'll explain this on the other side.
[00:29:50.842 --> 00:29:54.764]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.764 --> 00:29:59.866]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.866 --> 00:30:04.428]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:08.749]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.749 --> 00:30:14.512]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:19.794]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.114 --> 00:30:20.935]  Number 3.
[00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:24.517]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.517 --> 00:30:28.440]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.241]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.241 --> 00:30:32.002]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.002 --> 00:30:35.685]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.685 --> 00:30:36.466]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.466 --> 00:30:40.609]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.609 --> 00:30:45.372]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.652 --> 00:30:49.835]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:49.835 --> 00:30:51.616]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:53.878]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:53.878 --> 00:30:56.220]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:05.511]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:05.511 --> 00:31:14.373]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:18.994]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:31:18.994 --> 00:31:29.816]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:31:30.456 --> 00:31:39.958]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:39.958 --> 00:31:45.380]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:52.881]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:52.881 --> 00:31:55.622]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:32:00.788 --> 00:32:04.810]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.051]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:12.833]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:12.833 --> 00:32:19.236]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:19.236 --> 00:32:21.477]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.017 --> 00:32:22.317]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:22.317 --> 00:32:22.818]  Bernanke?
[00:32:22.818 --> 00:32:23.498]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:23.498 --> 00:32:24.779]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:27.020]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:40.908 --> 00:32:43.049]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:32:43.049 --> 00:32:48.191]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:48.191 --> 00:33:01.096]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:01.096 --> 00:33:09.959]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[00:33:25.985 --> 00:33:31.088]  The New York Times is reporting that several thousand U.S.
[00:33:31.088 --> 00:33:42.336]  Special Forces along with CIA in the last year have entered Yemen with the key port of Aden.
[00:33:46.254 --> 00:33:49.237]  They also want to go into Sudan.
[00:33:49.237 --> 00:33:52.359]  That's why you've seen media hype about that the last few years.
[00:33:52.359 --> 00:34:06.893]  The globalists could care less about the Christians being killed in Sudan, in Yemen, by Muslim extremists.
[00:34:06.893 --> 00:34:11.216]  In fact, where the Muslim extremists work with them, they leave them alone and encourage them to kill Christians.
[00:34:12.168 --> 00:34:21.592]  The Chinese are moving in to get the oil in North Africa, across the continent, from the west to the east.
[00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:38.440]  And AFRICOM, as we document in the Obama deception released last March, is going to stage pretext to be able to move in more troops.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.641]  And that is now what's happening.
[00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:51.173]  And we told you in Obama Deception that look for Africa to be the next base of operations in the quote war on terror.
[00:34:51.173 --> 00:34:58.617]  Now, in the last month they've been hyping that we've got to go into Yemen, we've got to go into Sudan.
[00:34:58.617 --> 00:35:04.120]  We've got to launch new wars there with ground troops and drones.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.741]  Hunting and killing whoever they want.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:16.921]  Continuing the process of the Air Force completely converting over to drones that the globalists can control, even if the military won't follow their unconstitutional orders in the future.
[00:35:16.921 --> 00:35:20.482]  And you better believe this whole system just being tested on the Muslims.
[00:35:20.482 --> 00:35:25.403]  It's for the American people.
[00:35:25.403 --> 00:35:27.383]  We are target number one.
[00:35:27.383 --> 00:35:29.064]  Read the Homeland Security documents.
[00:35:29.064 --> 00:35:32.564]  We released.
[00:35:32.564 --> 00:35:33.684]  Read the MIAC report.
[00:35:33.684 --> 00:35:36.625]  We released.
[00:35:36.625 --> 00:35:37.465]  That we received.
[00:35:41.544 --> 00:35:44.485]  This whole thing's pointed at us.
[00:35:44.485 --> 00:35:52.088]  Gun-owning, libertarian, conservatives, landowners, property owners, real leftists who don't like war.
[00:35:52.088 --> 00:35:53.709]  Unjust war.
[00:35:53.709 --> 00:35:56.390]  Anybody who doesn't love tyranny, you're the target!
[00:36:02.392 --> 00:36:05.074]  Now, when I say bombshell, I mean bombshell.
[00:36:05.074 --> 00:36:08.696]  We have a bombshell guest joining us in the last hour today.
[00:36:08.696 --> 00:36:16.441]  But I don't want to jinx it or hex it or foil it or spoil it.
[00:36:16.441 --> 00:36:22.044]  So I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:36:22.044 --> 00:36:25.526]  They've had hundreds of media calling them, but they know who we are, so they're coming on this show.
[00:36:25.526 --> 00:36:29.689]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:36:29.689 --> 00:36:30.129]  Oh boy.
[00:36:35.083 --> 00:36:49.253]  Gerald Salente coming up in the third hour to give us his trends forecast for the next year and the next decade.
[00:36:49.253 --> 00:37:02.902]  But I saw 9-11 coming a mile away, and analyzing the propaganda being put out, and then the internal preparations being made and internal sources we have, emergency managers, police, sheriff's deputies, FBI,
[00:37:04.545 --> 00:37:05.625]  And others.
[00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:08.687]  Federal Marshals.
[00:37:08.687 --> 00:37:17.210]  I was able in January to write articles and do radio shows saying they're gonna have a stage flu hype.
[00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:28.894]  It may be real, it may kill thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions as the government was saying, or it may just be a hoax to inoculate you, it may just be a moneymaker and a smoke screen to politically distract everybody.
[00:37:29.807 --> 00:37:32.389]  From what's going on with the banker takeover.
[00:37:32.389 --> 00:37:44.277]  But when we had emergency managers on record and others saying the feds are coming into our town saying get ready for martial law, get ready to lock down your cities, get ready for millions to die just in Indiana and Illinois alone.
[00:37:44.277 --> 00:37:45.718]  Same thing in upstate New York.
[00:37:45.718 --> 00:37:49.321]  We got secret documents from the Bureau of Cemeteries.
[00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:50.602]  It later became mainstream news.
[00:37:50.602 --> 00:37:51.943]  I mean, we get sent this stuff.
[00:37:51.943 --> 00:37:53.864]  Lord knows what we're missing.
[00:37:53.864 --> 00:37:56.446]  I'm just wallowing in documentation and intel.
[00:37:58.339 --> 00:37:59.400]  And how do I know it's real?
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:10.246]  I get a secret federal report, I call up the number of the watch officer and say, yeah, I've got code number, and then read it out to him, and... I want to know this is real.
[00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:11.847]  Well, first off, how did you get that?
[00:38:11.847 --> 00:38:12.367]  Who is this?
[00:38:12.367 --> 00:38:14.028]  I want to know who gave that to you.
[00:38:14.028 --> 00:38:14.829]  Hey!
[00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:16.770]  I'm Alex Jones, syndicated radio host.
[00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.032]  Is this your document?
[00:38:19.032 --> 00:38:20.853]  Well, you're not supposed to have that, Mr. Jones.
[00:38:20.853 --> 00:38:22.774]  I mean, they just right away let you know.
[00:38:22.774 --> 00:38:24.315]  Well, excuse me, I'm media.
[00:38:24.315 --> 00:38:26.836]  Last time I heard, we still got some freedom in this country.
[00:38:26.836 --> 00:38:27.817]  I'm putting this out!
[00:38:33.988 --> 00:38:45.574]  Then once I knew terms in the document, I knew indexes, I went and pulled up other CFR and ADL reports that had been written that this article, that that database was just integrated from.
[00:38:45.574 --> 00:38:51.197]  These people all go off central info and found it, confirmed after the phone call it was real.
[00:38:51.197 --> 00:38:53.978]  Curt Nimmo wasn't sure and I said, yes, Curt, it's real.
[00:38:53.978 --> 00:38:55.879]  Nail it, drop it.
[00:38:55.879 --> 00:38:56.759]  Curt's a good guy.
[00:38:56.759 --> 00:39:01.762]  I just, I was the one making the phone calls to make sure it was real.
[00:39:05.031 --> 00:39:07.872]  And my gut is never wrong.
[00:39:07.872 --> 00:39:11.073]  My only problem is I don't follow my gut enough.
[00:39:11.073 --> 00:39:17.055]  But I can't just have a gut feeling, like a parrot looking at a perch, thinking, well, it looks like that perch is stable.
[00:39:17.055 --> 00:39:18.575]  I've got to test the perch.
[00:39:18.575 --> 00:39:27.118]  I got to reach out with my bill, with my beak, and press on it to make sure it's stable before I get up on it.
[00:39:27.118 --> 00:39:28.458]  I smell something.
[00:39:28.458 --> 00:39:30.098]  Yeah, looks, okay, that's it.
[00:39:30.098 --> 00:39:31.739]  Then I got to test it and check a few things.
[00:39:34.028 --> 00:39:36.970]  And so I came on air and I said, look for the flu.
[00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:39.272]  I said, the feds are saying millions dead.
[00:39:39.272 --> 00:39:40.513]  I'm not saying that.
[00:39:40.513 --> 00:39:52.741]  And I said, at the time, COINTELPRO will angrily later spin, if this doesn't happen, then I said millions dead when I was reporting what they said.
[00:39:52.741 --> 00:39:58.645]  And I said, it will probably just be a hype to sell a bunch of vaccine that will have a sterilant or a chemical in it to hurt you.
[00:39:58.645 --> 00:39:59.666]  Turns out that's the case.
[00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.771]  The insert of the drug says it.
[00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:04.052]  Turns out it was all hype.
[00:40:04.052 --> 00:40:11.716]  Huge scandal in Europe as the World Health Organization gets caught being involved in it for money-making with big US, British, and European vaccine makers.
[00:40:11.716 --> 00:40:13.777]  And a bunch of people dying in vaccine trials.
[00:40:13.777 --> 00:40:15.077]  It's all over the news.
[00:40:15.077 --> 00:40:18.559]  Our news is so controlled, it's not really in our news.
[00:40:18.559 --> 00:40:20.620]  It's been a few places.
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:25.543]  Kind of like, oh, all over the world, the UN's giving people polio shots and it's killing them.
[00:40:25.543 --> 00:40:26.383]  It's weaponized.
[00:40:26.383 --> 00:40:27.924]  Oh, just an accident.
[00:40:27.924 --> 00:40:29.285]  Minor footnote, Associated Press.
[00:40:32.711 --> 00:40:36.153]  Meanwhile, everyone's hyperventilating in total fear.
[00:40:36.153 --> 00:40:41.155]  There's men with underwear bombs, firecrackers.
[00:40:41.155 --> 00:40:45.677]  Somebody else was in the bathroom for 19 minutes.
[00:40:45.677 --> 00:40:50.720]  The president was woken up from a nap to be aware that a man had diarrhea.
[00:40:52.855 --> 00:40:54.316]  I want to give up all my rights!
[00:40:54.316 --> 00:40:56.918]  I want body scanners to scan me!
[00:40:56.918 --> 00:41:02.083]  I didn't want my naked body recorded before for biometric access, but now I want to be scanned!
[00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:04.224]  Keep me safe!
[00:41:04.224 --> 00:41:10.690]  And they put people on the news to say, I want more security!
[00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:17.536]  Gee, I don't know why this guy was led through by some security guy and put on the plane and why somebody was videotaping him the entire flight!
[00:41:25.307 --> 00:41:26.588]  Gee, I don't know why.
[00:41:26.588 --> 00:41:29.149]  We need more security!
[00:41:29.149 --> 00:41:36.014]  Oh yeah, every time it's a fake terror attack, all the security's on stand down.
[00:41:36.014 --> 00:41:49.102]  Or in the case of 9-11, 7-7, and countless others, they're running drills of the exact targets being attacked at the same time, and then the government hides it in plain view, and comes out and announces they were doing drills.
[00:41:49.102 --> 00:41:51.823]  Of the exact targets at the exact time at the exact place.
[00:41:51.823 --> 00:41:52.744]  Completely impossible.
[00:41:56.926 --> 00:42:02.747]  We had an actuary done on 7-7, it was 23 trectogillian.
[00:42:02.747 --> 00:42:13.010]  One trectogillian is trillions of times all the grains of sand in all the world.
[00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:17.731]  It's ridiculous!
[00:42:17.731 --> 00:42:24.493]  Now, they're not just staging this to put in the body scanners at all the airports, which they're already doing, but to make you submit to it.
[00:42:29.531 --> 00:42:41.653]  They're not just doing it to boost Obama's approval rating as he can play the part of the Big Daddy that protects us with Big Sister Napolitano up there at Homeland Security.
[00:42:41.653 --> 00:42:47.875]  And Big Brother, the head of the Justice Department, now under Interpol control.
[00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:53.756]  As Obama pledges to sign us on to Gordon Brown's World Government Agreement, even though nobody else will sign on, it's such a fraud.
[00:42:55.706 --> 00:43:00.950]  It's a smoke screen, so nobody debates and reads what's in the 2,000-plus page health care bill.
[00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.872]  Because people now have found the rationing death panels.
[00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:04.652]  They're in there.
[00:43:04.652 --> 00:43:06.954]  They've now found the five years in prison.
[00:43:06.954 --> 00:43:15.920]  I have got scores of mainstream articles, even out of the communist Boston Globe, going, Democrats in our state are against it, saying it raises taxes and cuts benefits.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.601]  Don't you get it, communists?
[00:43:17.601 --> 00:43:19.342]  That's how this works.
[00:43:19.342 --> 00:43:24.805]  The bankers bankrupt the country, you pay all your taxes, and you get nothing but a gun in your face.
[00:43:24.805 --> 00:43:25.306]  You understand?
[00:43:31.894 --> 00:43:36.596]  Now people are finally reading it.
[00:43:36.596 --> 00:43:39.497]  But no one wants to talk about healthcare now.
[00:43:39.497 --> 00:43:42.158]  Goes into conference starting next Monday.
[00:43:42.158 --> 00:43:48.760]  Could be out of conference within two days.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:54.462]  Could be on the President's desk by next Friday.
[00:43:54.462 --> 00:43:55.943]  It goes into conference next Monday.
[00:43:55.943 --> 00:43:58.224]  It could be out of conference within two days.
[00:43:58.224 --> 00:44:01.165]  It could be on the President's desk by Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of next week.
[00:44:02.674 --> 00:44:04.495]  And then the bankers gobble up.
[00:44:04.495 --> 00:44:06.736]  The insurance company wrote the stinking bill.
[00:44:06.736 --> 00:44:08.156]  Liberals have finally found out about it.
[00:44:08.156 --> 00:44:10.597]  They're saying, well, I'm going to vote against you, Democrats.
[00:44:10.597 --> 00:44:11.638]  Oh, really?
[00:44:11.638 --> 00:44:14.159]  You're going to vote against the Democrats expanding all the wars?
[00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:15.479]  No, you like it.
[00:44:15.479 --> 00:44:17.320]  You're going to vote for them again in a year.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:17.880]  Don't worry.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:25.904]  It's like Republicans are going to vote for Republicans because they like feeling like they're winners and they like being scammed.
[00:44:32.165 --> 00:44:35.326]  I mean, I read over this bill, I can't even believe how bad it is.
[00:44:35.326 --> 00:44:37.126]  I can't believe this can happen in America.
[00:44:37.126 --> 00:44:38.347]  But it will!
[00:44:38.347 --> 00:44:40.807]  This is only the beginning!
[00:44:40.807 --> 00:44:51.150]  We're a bankrupt, reprobate, decadent, slovenly, arrogant, unthankful nation!
[00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.011]  Our men are decadent and arrogant.
[00:44:53.011 --> 00:45:00.113]  Our women, on average, are incredibly entitled, incredibly worldly, incredibly angry at everything.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.122]  Our children are falling apart.
[00:45:04.122 --> 00:45:05.042]  Look around you.
[00:45:05.042 --> 00:45:09.026]  This country is disintegrating.
[00:45:09.026 --> 00:45:20.417]  Well, you think old-timers that came out of the barbarian hordes taking over Rome, and they went through the Dark Ages and all of that, you think they were upright and pious because they were wimps?
[00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:22.379]  Because they were scared of having fun?
[00:45:23.413 --> 00:45:28.956]  No, they understood how dangerous life was if you weren't totally focused and had yourself together.
[00:45:28.956 --> 00:45:40.362]  And I'm not up here on some high horse saying I got myself together, but compared to the average yuppie... Compared to the average yuppie, I sure do.
[00:45:40.362 --> 00:45:50.427]  I mean, I am as focused as I possibly can be, trying to get myself in gear every day, trying to consciously focus on how deadly our straights are,
[00:45:51.428 --> 00:46:08.118]  The kind of dangerous waters we're in, and then I look over at the public laughing and giggling and playing with their... picking their nose, whatever they're doing, and you people have no idea how hard you're gonna get hurt.
[00:46:08.118 --> 00:46:19.024]  You have no idea how the Bill of Rights and Constitution and people's willingness to stand up for it, how that was a hedge of protection up around your sorry butt.
[00:46:19.024 --> 00:46:20.365]  And up around my sorry butt.
[00:46:21.431 --> 00:46:30.953]  And I look over that hedge, and I see what's already coming through the hedge, and I realize that isn't anything compared to the big monsters that are about to come through it.
[00:46:30.953 --> 00:46:33.954]  Hell's gates are being opened, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:33.954 --> 00:46:37.675]  It's like they were open to Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
[00:46:37.675 --> 00:46:39.696]  And Maoist China.
[00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:44.517]  And man, I'm watching the devils come up out of that pit in human form.
[00:46:44.517 --> 00:46:49.058]  And let me tell you, I'm having to gut up, and I get chills just thinking about what we're going under.
[00:46:54.019 --> 00:46:55.740]  I wish this didn't have to happen.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.061]  I wish we didn't have to go through this.
[00:46:57.061 --> 00:46:59.322]  And they're going to incrementally burn us to death.
[00:46:59.322 --> 00:47:08.767]  They're just going to move slow, slow, slow, but through the incrementalism, faster and faster and faster and faster.
[00:47:08.767 --> 00:47:13.190]  Just burning us up.
[00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:17.873]  I liken it to watching a child, I guess, die of a bad fever over three or four days.
[00:47:17.873 --> 00:47:19.934]  You just watch the life force pouring out of somebody.
[00:47:25.708 --> 00:47:29.289]  It's like watching my friend, 33 years old, on a respirator.
[00:47:29.289 --> 00:47:34.991]  And they were just keeping him alive until his dad got down here from Dallas and he was already dead.
[00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:40.693]  And they came in and started reading the last rites and he made one last panic to try to get up, try to get control of his body.
[00:47:40.693 --> 00:47:48.556]  And then I watched his eyes go dead and they looked at the numbers and they were like, his body's alive but he's dead.
[00:47:48.556 --> 00:47:54.398]  And I'm watching that last light go out of the Republic, that last little spark, and I'm watching the evil just pour in.
[00:47:56.893 --> 00:48:05.296]  And all you bad boys and tough guys that were sold and were imprinted like baby ducks on the image of evil.
[00:48:05.296 --> 00:48:11.437]  You think the image of evil is a big motorhead with smoke and teeth and fire pouring out of it.
[00:48:11.437 --> 00:48:13.038]  And it is.
[00:48:13.038 --> 00:48:19.600]  And in it is the souls of men and the pain and the anguish of innocence.
[00:48:22.409 --> 00:48:32.061]  In its big black foundry, in its big black coal-driven engine, humanity's souls are thrown in.
[00:48:32.061 --> 00:48:36.906]  And through your subconscious cowardice, you've tried to bind with the evil.
[00:48:36.906 --> 00:48:39.870]  You've tried to, at a subconscious level, befriend it.
[00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.392]  There's no befriending this.
[00:48:45.390 --> 00:49:03.047]  So all of you FBI, and all of you ADL, and all the Southern Poverty Law Center, and all the fake right-wingers, and all the socialists, and all of you, all of you that think you're part of the power structure and think you're on the winning team, you're going to be the most punished by this system.
[00:49:03.047 --> 00:49:03.948]  Mark my words.
[00:49:03.948 --> 00:49:05.269]  History proves it.
[00:49:05.269 --> 00:49:08.372]  Common sense documents it.
[00:49:08.372 --> 00:49:09.654]  And justice demands it.
[00:49:10.799 --> 00:49:13.942]  Let me tell you fools something who don't believe in a God.
[00:49:13.942 --> 00:49:20.528]  God doesn't wait till you die to judge you.
[00:49:20.528 --> 00:49:22.670]  Everything comes in twos in this world.
[00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:27.434]  Once the man, twice the child.
[00:49:27.434 --> 00:49:32.098]  And all of you in life will be judged many times over.
[00:49:32.098 --> 00:49:34.020]  You'll be judged for everything you've done.
[00:49:35.444 --> 00:49:42.810]  Your life is a hell because you are a decadent scumbag.
[00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:48.834]  You are a coward, and that is one of the greatest forms of evil.
[00:49:48.834 --> 00:49:56.400]  It's a sin against yourself, a sin against the innocence, a sin against your family name, a sin against God!
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.083]  You don't have to be perfect in this life, but you better have some guts.
[00:50:01.834 --> 00:50:05.016]  You better have some guts to at least do the right thing!
[00:50:05.016 --> 00:50:14.962]  You better have some guts to at least speak up and tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may, no matter what it shows!
[00:50:14.962 --> 00:50:17.644]  Okay, I've been preaching.
[00:50:17.644 --> 00:50:20.345]  I'm gonna come back and end-to-end read bombshell.
[00:50:20.345 --> 00:50:24.628]  Evidence clearly indicates staged attack on Detroit flight.
[00:50:24.628 --> 00:50:25.468]  Bombshell.
[00:50:25.468 --> 00:50:26.909]  Inside job.
[00:50:26.909 --> 00:50:27.990]  Evidence clearly states
[00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:33.032]  Clearly indicates staged attack on Detroit flight.
[00:50:33.032 --> 00:50:35.293]  A boil down.
[00:50:35.293 --> 00:50:45.900]  And when you go over the evidence end to end, the political, the massing of troops, when you go over it all, it is crystal clear.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:52.604]  Crystal, crystal, crystal clear what is really going on.
[00:50:55.222 --> 00:51:00.643]  And what this signifies, what they're kicking off, the new phase of their operation.
[00:51:00.643 --> 00:51:02.724]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[00:51:02.724 --> 00:51:05.184]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[00:51:05.184 --> 00:51:06.964]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[00:51:06.964 --> 00:51:10.945]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[00:51:10.945 --> 00:51:15.486]  Beta Prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.

[00:52:01.745 --> 00:52:05.749]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.749 --> 00:52:09.012]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.012 --> 00:52:10.414]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.115 --> 00:52:13.796]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.796 --> 00:52:20.177]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.177 --> 00:52:25.379]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.379 --> 00:52:35.361]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.481 --> 00:52:37.823]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.823 --> 00:52:39.404]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.404 --> 00:52:41.866]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.866 --> 00:52:43.988]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.988 --> 00:52:49.152]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.152 --> 00:53:01.903]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:01.903 --> 00:53:04.065]  Our economy is in great distress.
[00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:08.322]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[00:53:08.322 --> 00:53:13.843]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[00:53:13.843 --> 00:53:16.504]  You have auto and home insurance.
[00:53:16.504 --> 00:53:19.704]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[00:53:19.704 --> 00:53:23.005]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term?
[00:53:23.005 --> 00:53:25.646]  Because it might take years to recover.
[00:53:25.646 --> 00:53:31.327]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[00:53:32.199 --> 00:53:40.522]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[00:53:40.522 --> 00:53:47.624]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:52.106]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[00:53:52.106 --> 00:53:57.928]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[00:54:05.672 --> 00:54:29.367]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[00:54:35.403 --> 00:54:56.662]  I told you in January, February, and March, over and over again, there would be mass shootings in the United States by Muslim extremists.
[00:54:56.662 --> 00:55:01.486]  I told you they would be going into Yemen, and they would also be going into North Africa.
[00:55:03.035 --> 00:55:06.137]  On the East Coast to begin with.
[00:55:06.137 --> 00:55:10.038]  I told you they were going to have a giant flu hysteria.
[00:55:10.038 --> 00:55:11.859]  Because we were getting the documents.
[00:55:11.859 --> 00:55:13.240]  They were preparing.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.742]  They were telling police, 100% chance this flu thing is coming.
[00:55:17.742 --> 00:55:23.445]  So the police would panic and do what the feds told them when it came.
[00:55:23.445 --> 00:55:25.306]  It was all a federalization drill.
[00:55:25.306 --> 00:55:27.267]  And they're following everything.
[00:55:27.267 --> 00:55:29.048]  Look, it's not hard to figure this out.
[00:55:29.048 --> 00:55:31.469]  When you see the mass programming going on, you understand.
[00:55:33.892 --> 00:55:37.013]  And in 214 locations, they're putting the body scanners in.
[00:55:37.013 --> 00:55:41.654]  People are refusing because they know it's a naked image of their body.
[00:55:41.654 --> 00:55:45.415]  Homeland Security Next is looking at making you wear shock bracelets.
[00:55:45.415 --> 00:55:47.216]  This is mainstream news.
[00:55:47.216 --> 00:55:50.717]  They want to train you to live as a prisoner.
[00:55:50.717 --> 00:55:52.737]  Now they're saying you can't have your hands in your lap.
[00:55:52.737 --> 00:55:54.598]  You can't cover your lap with a blanket.
[00:55:54.598 --> 00:55:57.559]  You can't get up for an hour before the end of the flight.
[00:55:57.559 --> 00:55:58.099]  Or the beginning.
[00:56:00.626 --> 00:56:02.728]  You can't have no electronic devices.
[00:56:02.728 --> 00:56:05.169]  This is supermax prison level.
[00:56:05.169 --> 00:56:13.495]  And then TSA says that they're already in major bus stops and train stops and they're now going to be in schools and in malls.
[00:56:13.495 --> 00:56:16.017]  Mall of the Americas is now going to have TSA.
[00:56:16.017 --> 00:56:18.219]  This is happening!
[00:56:19.435 --> 00:56:23.437]  A total lockdown society with random checkpoints.
[00:56:23.437 --> 00:56:24.537]  It's happening!
[00:56:24.537 --> 00:56:25.918]  Foreign troops!
[00:56:25.918 --> 00:56:28.579]  Your kid's being trained to spy on you.
[00:56:28.579 --> 00:56:34.462]  It's all being announced!
[00:56:34.462 --> 00:56:41.785]  And it's all being announced incrementally.
[00:56:41.785 --> 00:56:46.107]  Now there is no doubt.
[00:56:46.107 --> 00:56:46.507]  No doubt.
[00:56:52.557 --> 00:56:54.017]  This is completely staged.
[00:56:54.017 --> 00:57:02.920]  You have the fact that they were amassing troops in Yemen, beginning the propaganda campaign, saying the next war is Yemen, just like with Afghanistan, just like with Iraq.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.540]  I mean, this is all timed out.
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.360]  It's the same formula.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:10.401]  The Pentagon is following a playbook.
[00:57:10.401 --> 00:57:11.262]  And I'm going to break it all down.
[00:57:11.262 --> 00:57:16.863]  What I'm going to do is, I'm going to, at the 8 after, I'm going to cover some healthcare news first.
[00:57:16.863 --> 00:57:20.824]  The 8 after, I'm going to read this entire article, then I'm going to open the phones up, then Gerald Cilente's coming on.
[00:57:22.363 --> 00:57:26.567]  With his trends for the next year on the economy, the police state, a lot more.
[00:57:26.567 --> 00:57:29.190]  Looking forward to the 2010-2011.
[00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:33.974]  Then I have a special guest joining us for 30 minutes in the last hour today.
[00:57:33.974 --> 00:57:36.016]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:57:36.016 --> 00:57:40.581]  I do want to just briefly at the end of this hour remind listeners that we are listener supported.
[00:57:41.613 --> 00:57:43.095]  And I appreciate your support.
[00:57:43.095 --> 00:57:49.762]  You can still get five and a half months free until the new year comes at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:57:49.762 --> 00:57:58.791]  Five plus months free right now at PrisonPlanet.TV where we simulcast at least the last half of the radio show every day on Living Color and Multimedia TV.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.523]  Where all of my films are in super high quality.

[00:58:07.047 --> 00:58:10.750]  PrisonPlanet.tv, an armory of resistance and awakening.
[00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:14.194]  And we're keeping the Christmas specials up for a few more weeks.
[00:58:14.194 --> 00:58:14.955]  Maybe shorter.
[00:58:14.955 --> 00:58:18.038]  We're just looking at taking them down right now.

[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:32.449]  And if your size is already sold out, we have some other t-shirts you can get free that are excellent, the Don't Tread on Me shirts, all available at InfoWars.com, and your purchases make this operation possible.
[00:58:32.449 --> 00:58:34.010]  We don't have George Soros of the U.N.
[00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.931]  funding us.
[00:58:34.931 --> 00:58:36.173]  You fund us.

[00:58:50.711 --> 00:58:53.733]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:53.733 --> 00:58:59.055]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.055 --> 00:59:01.096]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.096 --> 00:59:06.099]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.099 --> 00:59:07.300]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:08.420]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:10.301]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:11.382]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.382 --> 00:59:13.583]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:14.924]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:14.924 --> 00:59:16.444]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.444 --> 00:59:17.485]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:59:17.645 --> 00:59:18.967]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:59:18.967 --> 00:59:21.690]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:25.294]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.294 --> 00:59:29.118]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.118 --> 00:59:30.340]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:31.241]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.241 --> 00:59:32.342]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.342 --> 00:59:33.083]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.083 --> 00:59:34.084]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.364 --> 00:59:37.407]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:39.649]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:39.649 --> 00:59:40.630]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:41.811]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:43.652]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.972 --> 01:00:09.793]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.793 --> 01:00:11.373]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.373 --> 01:00:12.954]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.954 --> 01:00:17.134]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.134 --> 01:00:24.496]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:30.957]  If you Google or startpage.com the term healthcare and click news,
[01:00:32.287 --> 01:00:59.379]  Many of the mainstream news articles you will read, like this one out of the Boston Globe last night, they admit, the liberals admit, the real liberals, I mean at least they're honest about wealth redistribution, they go, hey, this is just to the banks and insurance companies, this actually cuts Medicare and Medicaid and cuts people's health care, this is horrible!
[01:00:59.379 --> 01:01:00.039]  What are you doing?
[01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:05.012]  What are you doing?
[01:01:05.012 --> 01:01:09.694]  What are you thinking?
[01:01:09.694 --> 01:01:17.258]  And that's why the abomination administration, he really is an abomination, because he's the latest version of fraud.
[01:01:17.258 --> 01:01:22.300]  Presidents are just going to get more evil from here, more slick.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:25.081]  We're lucky we've had old globalist dinosaurs running things.
[01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:29.183]  They're smart, they're wicked, but the world grew too fast for them.
[01:01:29.183 --> 01:01:33.005]  Now the younger, slicker Harvard lawyers are getting in and we're in trouble.
[01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:40.400]  But the good news is, people are now more awake.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.146]  So even though the globalists have upped their game, at a certain point, when you know it's all lies, it doesn't fly anymore.
[01:01:46.146 --> 01:01:51.611]  Look, this is out of the Metro desk, Boston Globe, Matt Verser.
[01:01:51.611 --> 01:01:53.633]  Brown, healthcare bill hurts mass.
[01:01:54.775 --> 01:01:57.856]  State Senator Scott P. Brown blasts his Democratic rival in the U.S.
[01:01:57.856 --> 01:02:14.302]  Senate race today for her support of the National Health Care Plan that Brown says would raise taxes and fees on Massachusetts residents and businesses without providing any benefits.
[01:02:14.302 --> 01:02:22.185]  And you go on and read article after article by liberals, Howard Dean, Michael Moore,
[01:02:24.304 --> 01:02:26.575]  Dennis Kucinich?
[01:02:26.575 --> 01:02:27.640]  I mean, I've always said it!
[01:02:28.931 --> 01:02:33.555]  If we're going to have socialism, why couldn't we just actually give it to poor people?
[01:02:33.555 --> 01:02:35.316]  That's not how it works.
[01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:39.440]  And then it creates a bunch of deadbeats who are then under government control.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:57.375]  I mean, you understand, they've now got half the population on the government payroll, and they're bringing in 3 million illegals, 1 million legals, and within another decade they'll have a Trump-proof foreign constabulary who will vote to take all your guns, and who will vote for total communism, and who will vote for anything if they're given handouts.
[01:03:00.094 --> 01:03:02.815]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[01:03:02.815 --> 01:03:15.341]  If we ever allow the people, through a pure democracy, to vote themselves public largesse, we will have a dictatorship overnight.
[01:03:15.341 --> 01:03:16.501]  51% will rob the other 49.
[01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:19.803]  Got it?
[01:03:19.803 --> 01:03:22.284]  And then people start becoming like Russians were.
[01:03:22.284 --> 01:03:23.184]  Why should I produce?
[01:03:23.184 --> 01:03:23.884]  Why should I work?
[01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:24.805]  Why should I build a business?
[01:03:26.462 --> 01:03:31.663]  You know, middle class and poor Russians who had a good-looking wife or daughter, they had them dress ugly.
[01:03:31.663 --> 01:03:35.785]  Because a commissar, just rape your daughter, take her away, kill her.
[01:03:35.785 --> 01:03:41.166]  If she fought off their advances, they'd send her to a death camp.
[01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:52.909]  If you had a little business, the communists, after a bunch of people starved to death and they were losing slaves, said, okay, well, you can have a small business on the side, or you can have a half acre you can grow stuff on, but as long as they could rob it.
[01:03:52.909 --> 01:03:54.470]  People said, I'm not going to plant anything for you.
[01:03:56.158 --> 01:03:59.240]  They'd say, you better plant, or I'm gonna rape your daughter.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.082]  They love it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:01.082 --> 01:04:10.549]  All the control freaks, all the savages, all the backstabbers, all the leechers, all the criminals, give an unlimited power over you!
[01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:18.295]  That's communism, that's fascism, that's big government in all its horrible flavors!
[01:04:18.295 --> 01:04:21.098]  Secret police, black uniforms, secret arrests, torture,
[01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:25.373]  Youth brigades, everything's being set up!
[01:04:25.373 --> 01:04:33.221]  And every control freak, every devil, every degenerate, every lazy sicko bully turned loose!
[01:04:33.221 --> 01:04:34.542]  Not me!
[01:04:34.542 --> 01:04:36.084]  You wage war on me?
[01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:40.809]  I'm waging info war on you to rally every red-blooded human against you!
[01:04:42.864 --> 01:04:46.008]  And then you're gonna try all your dirty tricks and all your nastiness.
[01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:49.112]  But by then, the sleeping giant will be awake.
[01:04:49.112 --> 01:04:54.419]  And in your hour of supposed victory, you're gonna be crushed.
[01:04:54.419 --> 01:04:58.144]  Lord knows I won't be there to see it, but I can already see the victory.
[01:05:00.131 --> 01:05:04.234]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:07.096]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:05:07.096 --> 01:05:08.377]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:05:08.377 --> 01:05:09.197]  It's very real.
[01:05:09.197 --> 01:05:11.439]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:05:11.439 --> 01:05:13.100]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:05:59.938 --> 01:06:05.244]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:06:05.244 --> 01:06:09.769]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:06:09.769 --> 01:06:12.052]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:13.674]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:06:13.674 --> 01:06:14.715]  There is a solution.

[01:06:59.841 --> 01:07:04.384]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.384 --> 01:07:05.305]  Number one.
[01:07:05.305 --> 01:07:08.727]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.727 --> 01:07:09.587]  Number two.
[01:07:09.587 --> 01:07:14.470]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:15.211]  It's true.
[01:07:15.211 --> 01:07:19.774]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.074 --> 01:07:20.915]  Number 3.
[01:07:20.915 --> 01:07:24.498]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:28.421]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:29.202]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.202 --> 01:07:31.964]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:35.647]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.647 --> 01:07:36.448]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.448 --> 01:07:40.591]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.591 --> 01:07:45.355]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.635 --> 01:07:49.798]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.798 --> 01:07:51.579]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.579 --> 01:07:53.841]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:53.841 --> 01:07:56.443]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.443 --> 01:08:05.950]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:08.212]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:19.176 --> 01:08:28.923]  Alright, let me go over exactly what's happening with the staged underwear bomber.
[01:08:28.923 --> 01:08:40.632]  I'm going to read this article by Aaron Dykes and I'm going to go through backup articles and other subsections that elaborate on this.
[01:08:40.632 --> 01:08:44.035]  Now remember, in the new year,
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:09:02.067]  Ten, eleven months ago, over and over again on radio, I said, they're going to have mass shootings at shopping malls and army bases, and they're going to attempt, and are going to succeed in some cases, to blow up airplanes with more shoe bombers.
[01:09:02.067 --> 01:09:05.649]  Because that's the provocateur program we've already identified.
[01:09:06.451 --> 01:09:12.856]  Both the mass shooting profile and the airplane profile, and we've seen other staged events over and over again.
[01:09:12.856 --> 01:09:19.680]  And the globalists get these programs they're running, they do the same thing over and over again until they launch a new program.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.123]  And then it takes us a while to identify that program, then we understand it.
[01:09:23.123 --> 01:09:27.886]  This is criminology.
[01:09:27.886 --> 01:09:33.010]  And of the elites, one thing, they are certainly pathological.
[01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:33.150]  Now,
[01:09:35.128 --> 01:09:36.909]  Let me go over this article.
[01:09:36.909 --> 01:09:37.870]  Bombshell.
[01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:41.853]  Evidence clearly indicates staged attack on Detroit flight.
[01:09:41.853 --> 01:09:43.694]  That's the InfoWars version headline.
[01:09:43.694 --> 01:09:45.295]  The Prison Planet headline is bombshell.
[01:09:45.295 --> 01:09:46.576]  Inside job.
[01:09:46.576 --> 01:09:48.997]  Or inside job bombshell.
[01:09:48.997 --> 01:09:53.440]  Evidence clearly indicates staged attack on Detroit flight.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.904]  And we're going to continue to cover this and healthcare and the globalist carbon tax takeover.
[01:09:58.904 --> 01:09:59.785]  Those are the big issues.
[01:10:00.982 --> 01:10:19.149]  CNN airs eyewitness testimony, confirming what we told you on Sunday, that well-dressed Indian accomplice helped the underwear bomber board without passport, and that man on plane filmed entire flight and bombing attempt.
[01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:20.810]  Entire flight!
[01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:28.153]  People were wondering why is he, and specifically, he filmed the entire flight, aiming it at the underwear bomber.
[01:10:32.918 --> 01:10:37.101]  The entire flight!
[01:10:37.101 --> 01:10:51.672]  And just like John Hinckley Jr., and every one of these other people, the shooter of Reagan, the shooter of John Lennon, they're always come from rich families, big bankers.
[01:10:51.672 --> 01:10:55.515]  Look at the Hinckleys having dinner with the Bushes two nights before the attack.
[01:10:55.515 --> 01:10:58.037]  That's Denver Post on Reagan.
[01:11:00.287 --> 01:11:03.668]  Maybe I'll get Paul Craig Roberts to talk about that sometime on air.
[01:11:03.668 --> 01:11:07.729]  He talked to us privately when we went to interview him at his home in Florida.
[01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:11.110]  I better just shut up.
[01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.991]  I've already said it.
[01:11:11.991 --> 01:11:12.631]  Call Roberts.
[01:11:12.631 --> 01:11:14.411]  Try to get him on for 20 minutes this week.
[01:11:14.411 --> 01:11:19.213]  Just tell him about the economy and where he sees it going and then I'll bring in the other points since I just did that.
[01:11:19.213 --> 01:11:19.713]  I can't.
[01:11:19.713 --> 01:11:22.494]  There's just too much information.
[01:11:22.494 --> 01:11:23.794]  I just know these people.
[01:11:23.794 --> 01:11:25.695]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[01:11:29.795 --> 01:11:33.180]  Bombshell!
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.984]  Evidence clearly indicates staged attack on Detroit flight.
[01:11:35.984 --> 01:11:45.639]  CNN airs eyewitness testimony that well-dressed Indian accomplice helped the underwear bomber board without passport and that man on plane filmed entire event and bombing attempt.
[01:11:47.489 --> 01:11:50.212]  And they've said the FBI doesn't want to talk to him.
[01:11:50.212 --> 01:11:56.818]  And the FBI doesn't want to talk to the families, multiple witnesses who saw the sharp-dressed man bring him in through security.
[01:11:56.818 --> 01:12:01.703]  And order them to put him on the plane with no ticket, no passport, no ID.
[01:12:01.703 --> 01:12:05.567]  It's no, it's not just passport, it's no nothing!
[01:12:05.567 --> 01:12:08.090]  They told him he was from a totally different country, Sudan!
[01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:16.377]  Hey, TSA, you want to find the terrorist?
[01:12:16.377 --> 01:12:29.045]  Next time you see somebody flashing security badges, leading some idiot onto a plane named Akeem or Abdul or something, you go ahead and frisk them.
[01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:30.506]  There's been some cases where this has happened.
[01:12:30.506 --> 01:12:32.927]  You're going to find the goodies.
[01:12:32.927 --> 01:12:33.768]  That happened in Britain.
[01:12:33.768 --> 01:12:35.149]  Paul Watson did an article about that.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.840]  Oh, heaven help me.
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.621]  The British police didn't go along with it and said, no, we're not letting these people in.
[01:12:40.621 --> 01:12:42.321]  You're trying to lead onto the plane.
[01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:46.722]  Again, British intelligence trying to lead them onto the plane.
[01:12:46.722 --> 01:12:51.863]  Oh yeah, Abdul, you're going to get a lot of money and get to be an agent with us.
[01:12:51.863 --> 01:12:55.544]  Just, just, just carry out this drill.
[01:12:55.544 --> 01:12:57.584]  You stupid patsies.
[01:12:57.584 --> 01:13:02.345]  Lee Harvey Oswald, McVeigh, every single time.
[01:13:04.941 --> 01:13:14.427]  I hope you special forces people, who they're grooming to be set up, I hope you know you're expendable.
[01:13:14.427 --> 01:13:22.092]  I hope all of you, I know they're training white Al Qaeda brigades right now, the FBI, CIA, and others are, and they're going to set you up.
[01:13:23.797 --> 01:13:26.058]  You're all a bunch of sociopath criminals, though.
[01:13:26.058 --> 01:13:26.659]  I know.
[01:13:26.659 --> 01:13:32.182]  Hey, there's hundreds of you, and there's only a couple of you that are going to get set up, drugged up, and then publicly executed.
[01:13:32.182 --> 01:13:33.683]  I understand that.
[01:13:33.683 --> 01:13:39.466]  But you still need to get it through your head that you're a bunch of sick freaks.
[01:13:39.466 --> 01:13:45.369]  No honor among you people!
[01:13:45.369 --> 01:13:47.811]  Evidence is emerging that clearly indicates
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:14:02.464]  The underwear bomber was more than just a Nigerian extremist carrying out his anger through an ill-conceived plot to ignite a powdery explosive substance on board a flight to the United States.
[01:14:02.464 --> 01:14:08.506]  Eyewitnesses' testimony pointing to a man helping the accused terrorist board without a passport.
[01:14:08.506 --> 01:14:14.728]  Folks, if real terrorists want to blow something up, they blow up soft targets.
[01:14:14.728 --> 01:14:16.509]  Buses, shopping malls, churches.
[01:14:20.762 --> 01:14:26.544]  They drive a truck in.
[01:14:26.544 --> 01:14:42.569]  They put bombs, and they've got a lot of different explosives, especially gas-based, and believe me, they send terrorists into an airport and have terrorists check their bags and luggage.
[01:14:42.569 --> 01:14:47.891]  You target three airplanes, guaranteed, 95% of the time, all three will make it through.
[01:14:50.509 --> 01:14:52.250]  These are not real terror attacks.
[01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:54.772]  The government wants the President to strip search you.
[01:14:54.772 --> 01:14:57.994]  Clinton signed an executive order to take blood from you at the DMV.
[01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:02.676]  They're just now getting around to implementing it.
[01:15:02.676 --> 01:15:03.397]  You understand?
[01:15:03.397 --> 01:15:17.926]  Eyewitness testimony pointing to a man helping the accused terrorist, bored without a passport, along with an unusual cameraman documenting the attempted attack on the entire flight.
[01:15:20.287 --> 01:15:23.708]  That's the handler going, see, we led you through security.
[01:15:23.708 --> 01:15:27.730]  See, we're here videotaping, we're just testing to see if airport security picks up on it.
[01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:29.631]  Play along, it's all a drill.
[01:15:29.631 --> 01:15:32.852]  Imagine that moron now.
[01:15:32.852 --> 01:15:35.053]  He's being told right now, just play along.
[01:15:35.053 --> 01:15:39.915]  And the FBI doesn't want to question the guy videotaping him or the people that saw him being led on.
[01:15:39.915 --> 01:15:42.436]  Oh no, let's not talk about that.
[01:15:42.436 --> 01:15:46.758]  Just like they told James Woods, who saw them drilling the week before 9-11 to shut up.
[01:15:46.758 --> 01:15:47.618]  On board the plane,
[01:15:49.358 --> 01:15:55.261]  Again, along with an unusual cameraman documenting the attempted attack on board the plane raised more than red flags.
[01:15:55.261 --> 01:16:04.145]  They point towards an intelligence operation, run as a drill, meant to conjure up public support for a number of fronts in the coming war on terror.
[01:16:04.145 --> 01:16:10.547]  Yeah, they hired an Egyptian intelligence agent, Ahmad Salam, had him cook a bomb, train the driver.
[01:16:10.547 --> 01:16:13.949]  They hired two people on New York welfare right at the retardation level.
[01:16:15.683 --> 01:16:20.044]  Ran it out of a mosque where there was a blind extremist cleric, so he couldn't notice what was going on.
[01:16:20.044 --> 01:16:24.425]  Then the FBI informant, Mod Salam, came to him and said, okay, you made me build a real bomb.
[01:16:24.425 --> 01:16:26.305]  That wasn't agreed to, and we got to stop them.
[01:16:26.305 --> 01:16:27.225]  They're about to bomb it.
[01:16:27.225 --> 01:16:28.706]  And they said, no, we're letting it go forward.
[01:16:28.706 --> 01:16:30.386]  And he knew he was being set up.
[01:16:30.386 --> 01:16:36.587]  So he recorded hour after hour of them talking about how they were going to let it happen.
[01:16:36.587 --> 01:16:39.788]  And that made it the New York Times and CBS News the first day until it got shut down.
[01:16:39.788 --> 01:16:43.329]  He gave a press conference on the steps of the courthouse.
[01:16:46.397 --> 01:16:54.662]  He figured, and it would have been Ahmad Salam, blew up the World Trade Center towers.
[01:16:54.662 --> 01:16:56.923]  But he was smart.
[01:16:56.923 --> 01:17:04.588]  And that investigation started coming out, so Clinton immediately launched an attack on Waco as a distraction.
[01:17:04.588 --> 01:17:05.769]  They know what they're doing.
[01:17:05.769 --> 01:17:07.930]  Just like this is a distraction for healthcare.
[01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:10.932]  Remember what Michael Savage even said six, eight months ago?
[01:17:10.932 --> 01:17:14.114]  In fact, you guys pull up, Savage says Obama may stage terror.
[01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:16.839]  I want to play that clip.
[01:17:16.839 --> 01:17:19.080]  He's actually said it a bunch of times, but just find one of the YouTube.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:26.405]  Savage says, because you know, a lot of you are new listeners and you love Michael Savage, so maybe if you hear it from him, you'll understand this.
[01:17:26.405 --> 01:17:28.786]  This is guaranteed staged.
[01:17:28.786 --> 01:17:30.467]  Guaranteed.
[01:17:30.467 --> 01:17:38.052]  Because not just all this on the ground evidence, but the way they hyped it, the way the troops are already in Yemen, the way they announced on the news beforehand.
[01:17:38.052 --> 01:17:38.553]  Listen to this.
[01:17:41.038 --> 01:17:50.367]  This was on December 24, 2009, the day before the Associated Press, battle against Al-Qaeda stepped up in Yemen.
[01:17:50.367 --> 01:17:51.808]  Here's a New York Times headline.
[01:17:51.808 --> 01:17:53.290]  Ooh, exactly the same.
[01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:55.452]  Battle against Al-Qaeda stepped up in Yemen.
[01:17:55.452 --> 01:17:57.114]  Here's the BBC.
[01:17:57.114 --> 01:17:59.396]  Almost identical, the day before.
[01:17:59.396 --> 01:18:01.518]  That's when the order went out.
[01:18:01.518 --> 01:18:03.580]  Yemen, new frontier in U.S.
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:04.441]  war on terror.
[01:18:06.587 --> 01:18:12.484]  It's hard to keep reporters for 24 hours before without trying to scoop each other.
[01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:29.841]  Just like they scooped each other with Building 7 an hour before the Feds blew that sky high on 9-11, the exact way the building blew and fell, got released to BBC, AP, Reuters, and got hammered out just like hours before they even released the name or had captured Lee Harvey Oswald.
[01:18:29.841 --> 01:18:36.446]  They already had his picture and name in Asian and Australian newspapers because they got the time zones off.
[01:18:36.446 --> 01:18:38.668]  They always make mistakes.
[01:18:38.668 --> 01:18:39.809]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:18:44.841 --> 01:18:49.684]  This is smoking gun info!
[01:18:49.684 --> 01:18:51.905]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:18:51.905 --> 01:18:52.986]  At least 2,000 U.S.
[01:18:52.986 --> 01:18:55.928]  Special Forces in Yemen.
[01:18:55.928 --> 01:19:01.611]  All they're doing is securing drug routes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:01.611 --> 01:19:04.172]  Yemen, new frontier on U.S.
[01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:05.193]  war on terror.
[01:19:05.193 --> 01:19:13.258]  An increased violence in Yemen is a clear indication that military campaigns to crush al-Qaeda-inspired violence extend far beyond the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[01:19:15.029 --> 01:19:26.516]  And then it goes into the 24 million people living there, and how it's a recruiting ground, and how 70 million or 40 million pounds has been spent, and how the CIA is there with U.S.
[01:19:26.516 --> 01:19:31.999]  commandos.
[01:19:31.999 --> 01:19:33.640]  And I haven't even gotten into my evidence yet.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:40.744]  I'm gonna come back, finish up with the article, and how they set this young punk up.
[01:19:40.744 --> 01:19:43.025]  Boy, I tell ya, they just, they hire him dumber and dumber.
[01:19:45.589 --> 01:19:47.831]  Because you got different types of terror.
[01:19:47.831 --> 01:19:53.114]  You got real terror, which is just asymmetrical warfare.
[01:19:53.114 --> 01:19:55.196]  Anyone resisting the globalists is called terror.
[01:19:55.196 --> 01:19:56.457]  Then you got all the fake forms.
[01:20:01.272 --> 01:20:03.433]  Is your computer running slowly?
[01:20:03.433 --> 01:20:05.194]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[01:20:05.194 --> 01:20:06.394]  Don't waste your money!
[01:20:06.394 --> 01:20:12.717]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam, and pop-ups.
[01:20:12.717 --> 01:20:14.398]  You don't need to buy a new computer.

[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:10.650]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:15.154]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system.
[01:21:15.154 --> 01:21:25.944]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:21:26.324 --> 01:21:35.509]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:21:35.509 --> 01:21:40.371]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:21:40.371 --> 01:21:41.912]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:41.912 --> 01:21:44.413]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:21:44.693 --> 01:21:45.514]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:45.514 --> 01:21:47.695]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:21:47.695 --> 01:21:48.456]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.456 --> 01:21:49.156]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:49.156 --> 01:21:51.458]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:51.458 --> 01:21:53.219]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:53.219 --> 01:21:54.340]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:14.190]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:20.212]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:20.212 --> 01:22:25.414]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:25.414 --> 01:22:35.398]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:35.518 --> 01:22:37.860]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:39.440]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.902]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:41.902 --> 01:22:44.023]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:44.023 --> 01:22:49.187]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:49.187 --> 01:22:54.190]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:21.392]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[01:23:21.392 --> 01:23:25.312]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[01:23:25.312 --> 01:23:29.453]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[01:23:29.753 --> 01:23:30.313]  We're good.
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.940]  Now I'll make another prediction.
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:12.682]  I predict that very soon, Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[01:24:12.682 --> 01:24:30.406]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are, Rahm Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind, and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[01:24:31.096 --> 01:24:34.737]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:46.899]  I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth.
[01:24:46.899 --> 01:24:56.081]  Hurting yourself, sell the deflected wounds, false flag, inside job, anyone who's taken community college level
[01:24:57.517 --> 01:25:03.621]  Criminology knows most crimes are inside jobs.
[01:25:03.621 --> 01:25:13.927]  Then you look at Kibono, who benefits, then you look at all the evidence on the ground, and most terrorism is staged.
[01:25:13.927 --> 01:25:19.830]  You've got events where a Palestinian woman goes on board a bus and stabs 25 people, killing 11 of them.
[01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:21.811]  That's real.
[01:25:21.811 --> 01:25:22.532]  That's rage.
[01:25:24.714 --> 01:25:31.417]  You've got events where Palestinian suicide bombers do go up in the middle of IDF soldiers and blow themselves up.
[01:25:31.417 --> 01:25:36.739]  That's real.
[01:25:36.739 --> 01:25:42.021]  I mean, you've got cases where a father blows up, comes home and kills their family.
[01:25:42.021 --> 01:25:46.202]  I mean, it's killing.
[01:25:46.202 --> 01:25:48.123]  You've got cases where Native Americans
[01:25:48.956 --> 01:25:50.777]  Would fight people trying to take their land.
[01:25:50.777 --> 01:25:52.239]  Today, they would be called terrorists.
[01:25:52.239 --> 01:25:56.522]  In fact, they were called evil, heathen, savage terrorists.
[01:25:56.522 --> 01:26:01.846]  And that doesn't mean I have solidarity with every group that's running around, you know, blowing themselves up.
[01:26:01.846 --> 01:26:08.211]  But the point is, they're always called cowards and they're always called, you know, terrorists and all this stuff.
[01:26:08.211 --> 01:26:10.033]  And what they are is people fighting.
[01:26:12.051 --> 01:26:13.592]  It's a military.
[01:26:13.592 --> 01:26:16.395]  I mean, it doesn't mean that your group can't still go out and try to kill them.
[01:26:16.395 --> 01:26:17.476]  I mean, that's what goes on.
[01:26:17.476 --> 01:26:19.718]  But just be honest about what they are.
[01:26:19.718 --> 01:26:30.087]  So, number one, they're training us to ninny and freak out over somebody with an underwear bomb who started a small fire on an airplane.
[01:26:31.254 --> 01:26:46.740]  And they're acting like it's the end of the world, and we've got to have body scanners, we've got to have checkpoints, and only essential travel should be allowed, and you've got to be a prisoner on the plane, and you can't get up and go to the bathroom, and you can't have electronics, and you can't cover your lap with anything now, and everyone's got to be watched and face forward.
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:50.502]  You're all prisoners!
[01:26:50.502 --> 01:26:52.883]  And hey, how dare you complain about all this airport security?
[01:26:52.883 --> 01:26:53.443]  This is needed!
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:27:02.643]  And now all these different client governments, the Egyptians and others, are saying, oh yes, there are 300 Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:02.643 --> 01:27:03.303]  Yesterday it was 25.
[01:27:03.303 --> 01:27:04.944]  Now there's 300.
[01:27:04.944 --> 01:27:12.387]  And the Fox News and CNN are reporting there's 5,000 white Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:12.387 --> 01:27:14.687]  Oh, you can't trust your white neighbor either.
[01:27:14.687 --> 01:27:20.089]  Oh, the conservative right-wingers, they secretly have linked up with the militias.
[01:27:20.089 --> 01:27:21.450]  I mean, I've seen this on the news.
[01:27:22.369 --> 01:27:31.713]  Because the real target of all of this is gun owners, conservatives, landowners, and people that don't want America to turn into a communist-run state for bankers.
[01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:32.473]  Literally.
[01:27:32.473 --> 01:27:34.955]  We have the MYAC and Homeland Security documents.
[01:27:34.955 --> 01:27:37.996]  It's all for the American people.
[01:27:37.996 --> 01:27:42.538]  And so, they're gonna blow up some airplanes and stop and foil some attacks.
[01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:50.495]  They're going to provocateur unstable Muslim lunatics who were always handled and run.
[01:27:50.495 --> 01:28:05.422]  Going back to the types, you've got real terror attacks, you've got provocateur where they find a useful idiot who think they're really working for some shadowy Muslim group and really they're working for MI5, MI6, CIA or other Western intelligence.
[01:28:05.422 --> 01:28:07.023]  That's come out literally hundreds of times.
[01:28:08.769 --> 01:28:28.688]  You've got other events, so you've got purely staged events, you've got provocateur events, you've got set-up events where they'll tell a young Muslim or somebody, yeah, be here, we're going to pick you up at the corner of Washington and Liberty for your new job, and then a truck bomb drives up, somebody gets out, they say, yeah, get in, the person walks off and the truck bomb blows up.
[01:28:30.896 --> 01:28:47.586]  So you've got provocateured, you've got real terrorism, provocateured action, you've got pure patsy action, and then you've got events that never happen, just where they say, oh, our ship was attacked, Gulf of Tonkin and many other cases, where they just make up it was attacked and then launch a huge war.
[01:28:47.586 --> 01:28:49.528]  You have just complete hoaxes.
[01:28:49.528 --> 01:28:59.714]  And then you have completely synthetic terror attacks that, from pillar to post, have no patsies, no idiots, no front men, no people you're setting up involved.
[01:29:00.643 --> 01:29:02.225]  You've got those.
[01:29:02.225 --> 01:29:16.820]  So let me see, you've got real terror attacks, you've got provocateur terror attacks, you've got patsy terror attacks, you've got hoax terror attacks, and you've got completely manufactured terror attacks that actually kill people.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:17.741]  How many types are there?
[01:29:19.482 --> 01:29:21.023]  That five?
[01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:34.752]  Real terror attacks, totally provocateur terror attacks, patsy terror attacks, terror attacks that didn't happen, they announced, and the fifth type, the completely manufactured, like 9-11.
[01:29:34.752 --> 01:29:36.373]  There's your five.
[01:29:36.373 --> 01:29:43.178]  Well, it wasn't completely manufactured, because you had a few patsies involved, but the main operation was a government run.
[01:29:43.178 --> 01:29:45.099]  So it's kind of a hybrid.
[01:29:45.099 --> 01:29:45.780]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.200]  Stay with us.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.661]  We'll continue with this latest case.
[01:29:50.925 --> 01:29:54.857]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.857 --> 01:29:57.546]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.919 --> 01:30:03.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:09.242]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.242 --> 01:30:11.302]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.302 --> 01:30:16.304]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.304 --> 01:30:17.484]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.484 --> 01:30:18.605]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.605 --> 01:30:20.485]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.485 --> 01:30:21.565]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.565 --> 01:30:23.766]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.766 --> 01:30:25.107]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.107 --> 01:30:26.407]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.627 --> 01:30:31.893]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:31.893 --> 01:30:35.477]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.477 --> 01:30:39.302]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.302 --> 01:30:40.543]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.543 --> 01:30:41.424]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.424 --> 01:30:42.546]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.546 --> 01:30:43.467]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.467 --> 01:30:44.288]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.548 --> 01:30:47.589]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:50.290]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:30:59.867 --> 01:31:05.174]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.174 --> 01:31:09.720]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.983]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:11.983 --> 01:31:13.605]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.605 --> 01:31:14.627]  There is a solution.
[01:31:14.867 --> 01:31:23.295]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:31:59.807 --> 01:32:06.771]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:08.052]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:32:08.052 --> 01:32:08.872]  It's very real.
[01:32:08.872 --> 01:32:12.754]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.

[01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:09.234]  I want to open the phones up specifically on healthcare.
[01:33:31.457 --> 01:33:36.986]  And of course, the latest underwear bomber launching a complete police state crackdown worldwide.
[01:33:36.986 --> 01:33:38.087]  New wars in Yemen.
[01:33:38.087 --> 01:33:40.992]  I mean, you gotta love it.
[01:33:40.992 --> 01:33:45.238]  The globalists bombard whole nations, destroy their infrastructure, Serbia, Iraq.
[01:33:46.283 --> 01:34:01.615]  You name it, and that's loving and good, but somebody sets off a firecracker, we all just cower and ask our giant military that's taken over our nation, and that spends more than all 50 states combined every year now, oh please, vanquish our enemies!
[01:34:01.615 --> 01:34:04.277]  All these people are subhuman, kill them!
[01:34:04.277 --> 01:34:08.300]  You don't think that same system doesn't see you as subhuman?
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:11.983]  Don't you understand if you don't value all human life, you don't value anybody's?
[01:34:11.983 --> 01:34:13.224]  That's why abortion's so bad.
[01:34:14.329 --> 01:34:15.570]  Oh, that's not a baby!
[01:34:15.570 --> 01:34:17.491]  Oh, that's not a human, that Iraqi!
[01:34:17.491 --> 01:34:19.953]  That's a Muslim extremist!
[01:34:19.953 --> 01:34:26.317]  Then the government puts Muslim extremists in charge in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:34:26.317 --> 01:34:31.040]  Who do you think funded the Muslim extremists to take over Iran in 53?
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:34.202]  Who do you think funded the Muslim extremists to take over Afghanistan in the 80s?
[01:34:35.885 --> 01:34:39.708]  Who do you think used Muslim extremists to bring down Saddam?
[01:34:39.708 --> 01:34:40.808]  I'm sick of it!
[01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:46.993]  All you stupid fake conservatives telling me give up my rights or some turban-headed boogeyman's gonna get me.
[01:34:46.993 --> 01:35:04.525]  Don't you understand that those turban-headed boogeymen are a bunch of opium-running mafiadons who use a bunch of idiot Muslims beneath them to go out and stir up a few problems to scare the ninnying West into going along with giving up their freedom when the whole thing's aimed at us?
[01:35:05.555 --> 01:35:05.635]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:05.635 --> 01:35:06.956]  People better get this and get it quicker.
[01:35:06.956 --> 01:35:08.357]  It's over for this country.
[01:35:19.104 --> 01:35:21.806]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:21.806 --> 01:35:24.028]  You've heard me go over some of the evidence.
[01:35:24.028 --> 01:35:24.809]  The hype.
[01:35:24.809 --> 01:35:27.030]  The troops already being deployed to Yemen.
[01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:30.913]  The troops already being deployed to other areas in the Middle East and North Africa.
[01:35:30.913 --> 01:35:32.895]  The hype saying we've got to go in.
[01:35:32.895 --> 01:35:36.138]  The hype saying look for people to try to bomb airplanes.
[01:35:36.138 --> 01:35:39.100]  If they're going to keep the police state going, they've got to provocateur it.
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:44.925]  Then you've got this rich kid on no-fly list who's allowed to get on the airplane
[01:35:46.516 --> 01:35:52.461]  And then a man's there filming the whole flight with his camera aimed at the hijacker.
[01:35:52.461 --> 01:35:55.264]  Aimed at the bomber.
[01:35:55.264 --> 01:35:58.167]  And then you got his dad, who's rich, who warns the U.S.
[01:35:58.167 --> 01:36:03.672]  Embassy, confirmed now that his son was getting involved with terrorists.
[01:36:03.672 --> 01:36:07.135]  But if you're a congressman who makes the government mad, you can't fly.
[01:36:07.135 --> 01:36:10.338]  If you're a veteran, you suddenly are on the no-gun-by list.
[01:36:10.338 --> 01:36:11.459]  No judge, no jury.
[01:36:11.459 --> 01:36:12.800]  A million-plus and growing.
[01:36:14.363 --> 01:36:25.073]  But if you are Mohammed Adda, and again on any of these issues, it's been repeated over and over again, the Malaysian terror summit a year before 9-11, they're all on the terror watch list.
[01:36:26.994 --> 01:36:28.995]  Mohammed Adda and five others.
[01:36:28.995 --> 01:36:31.776]  They fly back into Saudi Arabia to then fly to the U.S.
[01:36:31.776 --> 01:36:38.059]  The embassy says no, they are listed as al-Qaeda terrorists, and they get a call from the State Department saying, you'll let them in, Springman.
[01:36:38.059 --> 01:36:39.480]  He said, I'm not going to do that.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:40.320]  That's immoral.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:47.383]  He gets a call from one of the deputy heads of the State Department saying, look, this is a CIA cover.
[01:36:47.383 --> 01:36:48.924]  Those guys are being trained at U.S.
[01:36:48.924 --> 01:36:50.445]  military bases in counter-terror.
[01:36:52.025 --> 01:36:56.088]  And then the media spun that, well, Al-Qaeda must have infiltrated then.
[01:36:56.088 --> 01:37:02.093]  I saw these headlines, like, FBI believes there's Al-Qaeda moles at the top of the Justice Department.
[01:37:02.093 --> 01:37:03.094]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:03.094 --> 01:37:04.875]  Guys in turbans from caves.
[01:37:04.875 --> 01:37:06.016]  Uh-huh.
[01:37:06.016 --> 01:37:10.500]  Don't you FBI guys see it when it's right in front of your face?
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:12.141]  It's true they trained at our bases.
[01:37:12.141 --> 01:37:13.962]  It's true we let them in.
[01:37:13.962 --> 01:37:15.644]  They were double-triple agents.
[01:37:15.644 --> 01:37:16.324]  That's how.
[01:37:16.324 --> 01:37:17.545]  They double-crossed us.
[01:37:17.545 --> 01:37:18.426]  Oh, yeah, they did.
[01:37:20.151 --> 01:37:22.753]  That's how they mentally... Well, okay, well that's the case.
[01:37:22.753 --> 01:37:24.674]  Let's have a big investigation about it.
[01:37:24.674 --> 01:37:26.675]  Let's see it in more than just a few newspapers.
[01:37:26.675 --> 01:37:32.599]  Because the average schmo out there, getting raped by the government, doesn't know why they're getting raped.
[01:37:32.599 --> 01:37:35.021]  They really think Mohammed Atta attacked us.
[01:37:35.021 --> 01:37:43.186]  They don't know that guy was trained at more spook compounds than James Bond!
[01:37:43.186 --> 01:37:44.087]  Comprende?
[01:37:44.087 --> 01:37:48.310]  Oh, man, I'm getting angry.
[01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:55.732]  See, it's the same story over and over and over.
[01:37:55.732 --> 01:38:00.096]  Muhammad Ada and others did drill after drill after drill after drill.
[01:38:00.096 --> 01:38:02.317]  It came out in the news.
[01:38:02.317 --> 01:38:07.661]  And people get off the planes, captains would report them, and the FBI would come to them and say, you keep your mouth shut about what you saw.
[01:38:07.661 --> 01:38:09.943]  Do you understand?
[01:38:09.943 --> 01:38:17.029]  And see, the FBI, they don't want to talk to all these families and all these witnesses and all these well-trained witnesses like lawyers and others.
[01:38:20.506 --> 01:38:24.710]  Who were there and are clearly, definitively reporting on what they saw.
[01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:25.912]  They don't want to talk to them.
[01:38:25.912 --> 01:38:30.056]  Now there's public pressure, they might.
[01:38:30.056 --> 01:38:33.720]  Because they've been told, don't look into that.
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.562]  Don't look into who brought them through security.
[01:38:35.562 --> 01:38:37.324]  Don't look at why they didn't need any ID.
[01:38:37.324 --> 01:38:41.328]  Don't look at why somebody was videotaping them, had the camera trained on them.
[01:38:41.328 --> 01:38:42.189]  What was that for again?
[01:38:45.168 --> 01:38:46.508]  That's to make the patsy feel good.
[01:38:46.508 --> 01:38:47.909]  Let me walk you through security.
[01:38:47.909 --> 01:38:49.769]  Helping you here.
[01:38:49.769 --> 01:38:50.950]  For the drill.
[01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:53.951]  Now, once on the plane, we're going to do this drill.
[01:38:53.951 --> 01:38:57.592]  It's going to test the responsiveness of air marshals on board.
[01:38:57.592 --> 01:39:05.654]  And I guarantee you, they're telling that moron, right now, that okay, now you're in a deeper cover operation.
[01:39:05.654 --> 01:39:07.215]  Just go along with this through the trial.
[01:39:08.368 --> 01:39:21.920]  In fact, I remember articles like four or five years ago, mainstream news, Watson's got to pull them up, where it would turn out they would stage fake arrest of Al-Qaeda leaders and then release them a year later and it would say, well they staged their arrest for their safety and I released them later.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:25.243]  I'll guarantee you that's it.
[01:39:25.243 --> 01:39:26.203]  All the pieces.
[01:39:26.203 --> 01:39:28.005]  Now we know it's staged.
[01:39:28.005 --> 01:39:34.791]  We know with Hassan, it's been reported multiple shooters, guns going off for minutes after he was on the ground.
[01:39:36.345 --> 01:39:44.871]  We know he was for two years talking to who he believed was Al-Qaeda, this Muslim cleric who in every case of foiled bombings in the U.S.
[01:39:44.871 --> 01:39:51.776]  or shootings is the Muslim leader of the people who's always left alone.
[01:39:51.776 --> 01:39:57.080]  This idiot, Hassan, for two years is throwing fits about how much he loves suicide bombers,
[01:39:59.921 --> 01:40:02.523]  Anyone else would have been court-martialed in seconds.
[01:40:02.523 --> 01:40:03.623]  He's left alone.
[01:40:03.623 --> 01:40:04.244]  He's protected.
[01:40:04.244 --> 01:40:07.505]  He thinks he's sending emails to Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:07.505 --> 01:40:13.869]  And the CIA and FBI leave it alone and then tell Congress they can't see the full emails for national security.
[01:40:13.869 --> 01:40:18.472]  Just like they can't see Mohamed Adda and his training record at U.S.
[01:40:18.472 --> 01:40:19.452]  bases.
[01:40:19.452 --> 01:40:22.014]  Do you understand it's on record they were trained at bases?
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.661]  Now, do we know exactly what happened?
[01:40:24.661 --> 01:40:25.502]  No.
[01:40:25.502 --> 01:40:28.123]  But we know the official story is a lie.
[01:40:28.123 --> 01:40:36.408]  It's got more holes than a Folger can that you shoot in the back of grandma's back 40 with a 12 gauge.
[01:40:36.408 --> 01:40:40.471]  More holes than a sieve.
[01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:43.893]  Than a redneck sieve, a Folger can with a shotgun blast through it.
[01:40:49.346 --> 01:40:51.027]  We know who's got the motive.
[01:40:51.027 --> 01:40:53.689]  We've seen this duck walk down the runway.
[01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:58.933]  We know what it looks like, how it quacks, how it waddles, how it swims.
[01:40:58.933 --> 01:41:01.435]  We've seen it over and over again.
[01:41:01.435 --> 01:41:07.199]  This duck was born and bred to scare chicken-necked, limp-wristed yuppies.
[01:41:08.368 --> 01:41:11.490]  Into hurting their kids through naked body scanners.
[01:41:11.490 --> 01:41:14.972]  And notice now, all over the media and the feds, we've got to have scanners!
[01:41:14.972 --> 01:41:17.193]  Everybody's got to go through them!
[01:41:17.193 --> 01:41:19.014]  Local flights, we don't care!
[01:41:19.014 --> 01:41:23.276]  Biometrics, DNA, shock bracelets, you've got to have it all!
[01:41:23.276 --> 01:41:24.837]  We've got to have them in malls!
[01:41:24.837 --> 01:41:27.338]  The terrorists are going to hit malls!
[01:41:27.338 --> 01:41:28.119]  What did I tell you a year ago?
[01:41:29.684 --> 01:41:34.568]  And now they're having weird drills at Mall of the American everywhere else and drills in Austin.
[01:41:34.568 --> 01:41:50.863]  And I'm telling you folks, you start seeing a bunch of cops running around and a bunch of people on walkie-talkies in a mall, you better get you and your family out of there because they'll gun your butt down, shoot a few cops while they're at it, the commandos will run out the back door, they'll have some bearded patsy they shoot in the back of the head.
[01:41:51.784 --> 01:41:58.965]  And they tell these special forces men, we're doing this because America is threatened by the Muslims and by killing a few of our weak people.
[01:41:58.965 --> 01:42:01.786]  We get them motivated to be tough like they need to be.
[01:42:01.786 --> 01:42:04.306]  That's why you were chosen for this program, Captain.
[01:42:04.306 --> 01:42:06.447]  Are you ready to carry out this operation?
[01:42:06.447 --> 01:42:09.327]  Yes, sir, I am!
[01:42:09.327 --> 01:42:15.068]  And just in case you ever think you're going to speak out, you understand your family will be held responsible.
[01:42:15.068 --> 01:42:17.248]  Yes, sir, I do!
[01:42:17.248 --> 01:42:18.469]  That's why you volunteered.
[01:42:18.469 --> 01:42:19.269]  Good.
[01:42:19.269 --> 01:42:20.169]  Good, Red Leader.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:32.247]  Ten years later, red leaders leading 20-30 squads worldwide, murdering and torturing.
[01:42:32.247 --> 01:42:33.188]  That's how this works!
[01:42:33.188 --> 01:42:40.853]  They get them in those briefing rooms and go, you're real men, selected for the assassination teams you've led against communists and child molesters.
[01:42:40.853 --> 01:42:45.856]  And then they slowly get them into killing more and more innocent people.
[01:42:45.856 --> 01:42:47.938]  Until they believe the end justifies the means.
[01:42:47.938 --> 01:42:49.199]  What do they give Delta Force?
[01:42:50.447 --> 01:42:55.829]  As their graduation, before they get chosen, they passed all the physical stuff.
[01:42:55.829 --> 01:43:05.154]  It's a joint forces group of the Navy SEALs, the Marine Force Recon, Army Green Berets.
[01:43:05.154 --> 01:43:09.415]  How do they hire them?
[01:43:09.415 --> 01:43:11.376]  They go, okay, you've passed everything.
[01:43:11.376 --> 01:43:17.479]  You have one night to read Machiavelli's The Prince, The End Justifies the Means, and write a report on it.
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:30.582]  And if you write a report and say, the end justifies the means, I'll kill a hundred innocent people to save a thousand, then welcome, you passed the test.
[01:43:30.582 --> 01:43:38.723]  Welcome to Delta Force.
[01:43:38.723 --> 01:43:40.223]  And then the guy says they won't do it.
[01:43:40.223 --> 01:43:47.064]  They say, we've decided, we've decided you're better for command.
[01:43:47.064 --> 01:43:49.885]  We're going to move you to special forces training.
[01:43:51.408 --> 01:43:53.490]  You're not going to be in an active squadron.
[01:43:53.490 --> 01:43:56.172]  Good job, you passed the test.
[01:43:56.172 --> 01:44:00.736]  That's how the masons select the good guys from the bad guys.
[01:44:00.736 --> 01:44:02.358]  And they tell the good guys, oh you passed the test.
[01:44:02.358 --> 01:44:04.860]  They tell the bad guys you passed the test.
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:08.223]  And they compartmentalize it.
[01:44:08.223 --> 01:44:09.284]  And that's how this works.
[01:44:09.284 --> 01:44:11.646]  And that's why they go out and wire the World Trade Centers.
[01:44:14.195 --> 01:44:22.257]  And they got a big pool of zealots who carry out terror attacks believing they're working for Muslim groups, really funded by the globalists in most cases.
[01:44:22.257 --> 01:44:25.878]  And they got radical Israelis who believe they're working for Israel.
[01:44:25.878 --> 01:44:28.879]  Don't see the bigger picture, they carry out terror attacks.
[01:44:28.879 --> 01:44:36.021]  And they got a bunch of people from our government and Christians, mainly Protestants and others.
[01:44:36.021 --> 01:44:40.823]  People that have converted from being Protestants so they can work for the Vatican as mercenaries like Eric Prince.
[01:44:43.177 --> 01:44:53.063]  Blackwater, totally devilish, he unjustifies the means.
[01:44:53.063 --> 01:45:11.295]  Now I've gone over a lot of this and there's other facets, but you see the pre-programming before the attack, you see the same rollout as Afghanistan and Iraq, the troops mass, they tell you get ready, they announce here's the new enemy, they launch the attack, and now they're saying, and if the public bites on this,
[01:45:12.776 --> 01:45:13.496]  They'll escalate it.
[01:45:13.496 --> 01:45:16.138]  The public didn't bite on the flu, so they backed off on that.
[01:45:16.138 --> 01:45:23.403]  If the public bites on this... Again, I told you that those White House terror alerts were politically motivated.
[01:45:23.403 --> 01:45:26.906]  Every time they wanted to get legislation passed, that's now been declassified.
[01:45:26.906 --> 01:45:29.047]  It's on record, it's a fraud.
[01:45:29.047 --> 01:45:32.109]  You understand?
[01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:40.755]  And it's also being launched now because his approval rating has fallen to a certain point, that he's now in terminal decline, lowest level of any president one year into their presidency, less than one year, 11 months.
[01:45:43.663 --> 01:45:44.884]  It'll be a year.
[01:45:44.884 --> 01:45:45.384]  January 21st.
[01:45:45.384 --> 01:45:48.707]  Next year.
[01:45:48.707 --> 01:45:51.870]  Less than a month from now.
[01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:54.032]  What, 22 days from now?
[01:45:54.032 --> 01:45:56.714]  23?
[01:45:56.714 --> 01:45:58.976]  So, it just fits on all their fronts.
[01:45:58.976 --> 01:46:05.881]  That's why I said, look for staged terror attacks.
[01:46:05.881 --> 01:46:08.804]  Now, Savage hates Muslims so much, he probably won't get it.
[01:46:09.605 --> 01:46:11.566]  He said, look for staged events.
[01:46:11.566 --> 01:46:13.167]  Hey, Savage, can you see it?
[01:46:13.167 --> 01:46:15.209]  This is the beginning of the Reichstag events.
[01:46:15.209 --> 01:46:17.410]  But it's against the Muslims you hate so much.
[01:46:17.410 --> 01:46:34.922]  What you need to understand, Savage, is this is being done so that the public goes along with the next tightening of the straitjacket of the chains we're in in the name of fighting them over there when it's really designed for us here and to launch new wars.
[01:46:34.922 --> 01:46:36.563]  Okay, let's go to Mike in California.
[01:46:36.563 --> 01:46:37.304]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:46:37.304 --> 01:46:37.664]  Go ahead.
[01:46:39.417 --> 01:46:40.978]  Hi, how are you doing, Jones?
[01:46:40.978 --> 01:46:42.079]  Good.
[01:46:42.079 --> 01:46:43.420]  Alright, I have a couple of questions.
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:44.401]  One, the health care bill.
[01:46:44.401 --> 01:46:49.785]  I know that you went over all the negative aspects that comes with the bill.
[01:46:49.785 --> 01:46:58.311]  When do you see that, see them actually trying to, I guess, implement a lot of those negative things into law?
[01:46:58.311 --> 01:47:04.816]  Well, they're run by, the globalists are run by psych warfare experts who understand human and animal psychology.
[01:47:06.121 --> 01:47:07.702]  So it's a domestication process.
[01:47:07.702 --> 01:47:09.942]  It'll be done incrementally.
[01:47:09.942 --> 01:47:17.385]  That's why they're going to phase it in over four years, because they found if people feel like they're given wiggle room, that they'll go along with something.
[01:47:17.385 --> 01:47:22.086]  So, oh, it phases in over four years, and the first year you don't get five years of prison.
[01:47:22.086 --> 01:47:23.667]  You just get a fine.
[01:47:23.667 --> 01:47:26.828]  But in four years, you know, if you don't have it, that gives you plenty of time.
[01:47:26.828 --> 01:47:27.388]  Come on!
[01:47:27.388 --> 01:47:30.389]  And that allows them to fine-tune it, find out who's resisting.
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:32.421]  Propagandize more.
[01:47:32.421 --> 01:47:38.928]  It's like they always phase in new anti-gun bills over time or new environmental taxes over time.
[01:47:38.928 --> 01:47:40.269]  So, no, we know.
[01:47:40.269 --> 01:47:41.891]  Four years.
[01:47:41.891 --> 01:47:42.852]  In 2013, in 2014, it'll be fully implemented.
[01:47:48.567 --> 01:47:54.292]  So, but starting in 2010 up to about 2014 is when we can see some of the negative aspects of this bill.
[01:47:54.292 --> 01:48:01.539]  Well, I mean, yeah, they will immediately next year start jerking money out of your paychecks and making your employer give matching money for insurance.
[01:48:01.539 --> 01:48:04.802]  And then the insurance companies have already started raising prices and their stocks are way up.
[01:48:04.802 --> 01:48:05.883]  They wrote the bill.
[01:48:05.883 --> 01:48:07.724]  It's a giant corporate boondoggle.
[01:48:07.724 --> 01:48:11.468]  See, in the New World Order, you pay your taxes directly to the banks, which are the insurance companies.
[01:48:12.150 --> 01:48:13.990]  It's Siamese twins.
[01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:21.492]  And, uh, just like, you know, they're announcing, we don't care if Copenhagen failed, you will now pay your taxes directly to the IMF.
[01:48:21.492 --> 01:48:22.332]  Isn't that illegal, though?
[01:48:22.332 --> 01:48:23.813]  I mean, like... It's only legal!
[01:48:23.813 --> 01:48:26.533]  Well, I mean, it's illegal to say there's no Fourth Amendment.
[01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:28.814]  We spy on all of you without warrants.
[01:48:28.814 --> 01:48:30.594]  It's illegal to say we grab U.S.
[01:48:30.594 --> 01:48:33.655]  citizens off the street, take them to black sites for torture.
[01:48:33.655 --> 01:48:36.136]  It's illegal when CIA aircraft crash every year.
[01:48:36.136 --> 01:48:40.917]  Imagine how many others aren't crashing full of pure cocaine, meaning it's coming from the source.
[01:48:42.342 --> 01:48:49.444]  I mean, it's illegal according to human law and common sense to be putting hundreds of deadly chemicals in the water supply.
[01:48:49.444 --> 01:48:51.525]  But they do it!
[01:48:51.525 --> 01:49:02.408]  What I meant by that is that I was reading in the, I guess in the news, on the internet and so on and so forth, that the various politicians are going to try to fight it in the court and say that, okay, it's against the Constitution.
[01:49:02.408 --> 01:49:03.889]  Yes, it's totally unconstitutional.
[01:49:05.003 --> 01:49:07.865]  And I have one other question.
[01:49:07.865 --> 01:49:09.026]  I mean, that's the good news.
[01:49:09.026 --> 01:49:09.447]  You're right.
[01:49:09.447 --> 01:49:10.628]  You're right, Mike.
[01:49:10.628 --> 01:49:14.290]  If we fight this, and if we just start fighting these people, we'll win.
[01:49:14.290 --> 01:49:15.271]  It'll take time.
[01:49:15.271 --> 01:49:16.472]  It won't be overnight.
[01:49:16.472 --> 01:49:22.357]  But these yuppies, they want a McDonald's Happy Meal instantly out the window.
[01:49:22.357 --> 01:49:25.639]  And let me tell you, you're not going to beat these people overnight.
[01:49:25.639 --> 01:49:27.921]  It's going to take commitment and never stopping.
[01:49:27.921 --> 01:49:28.642]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:49:29.554 --> 01:49:45.051]  Yeah, you're absolutely right, because I'm imagining if people see in their paycheck, you know, all these different taxes or new taxes and whatever that's going to be coming out of their paycheck taken out, it seems like it should cause a goddamn revolt with all the stuff that's going on with the economy.
[01:49:45.051 --> 01:49:47.814]  I hear you and I appreciate your call, but that's the issue.
[01:49:49.485 --> 01:50:02.812]  That's why, oh, it's a quarter percent of a point the first six months, and then one percent, and then two, and then 2.5, and then three, and then 3.5, and then four.
[01:50:02.812 --> 01:50:07.335]  But how many taxes take two, three percent out of your check?
[01:50:07.335 --> 01:50:14.979]  I had an accountant do the numbers, because I pay all the taxes, all the fines, all the fees, keep my nose clean so I can expose these criminals and not let them catch me on the technicality.
[01:50:17.139 --> 01:50:18.360]  I choose my battles.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.262]  You choose yours.
[01:50:20.262 --> 01:50:26.848]  And I'm paying 71% taxes.
[01:50:26.848 --> 01:50:29.730]  And then my employees are all paying taxes.
[01:50:29.730 --> 01:50:37.457]  71% of the money goes to some stinking government.
[01:50:37.457 --> 01:50:42.402]  I mean, feudal serfs in Europe only pay 10 to 20.
[01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:43.463]  Sheriff of Nottingham
[01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:52.059]  Was taken 20, and that caused a revolt in central and northern England.
[01:50:52.059 --> 01:50:54.062]  In Sheffield, where Watson sits over there.
[01:50:54.062 --> 01:50:54.082]  20%.
[01:50:54.082 --> 01:50:56.845]  What was it, a 3% tax on tea was the last straw here?
[01:51:00.854 --> 01:51:03.295]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:51:03.295 --> 01:51:05.175]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[01:51:05.175 --> 01:51:07.035]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[01:51:07.035 --> 01:51:08.476]  We paid off all of our bills.
[01:51:08.476 --> 01:51:11.256]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[01:51:11.256 --> 01:51:16.898]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[01:51:16.898 --> 01:51:18.578]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:51:18.578 --> 01:51:21.179]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:51:21.179 --> 01:51:21.639]  No More Mortgage.
[01:51:23.679 --> 01:51:24.960]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:27.462]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:51:27.462 --> 01:51:31.364]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[01:51:31.364 --> 01:51:33.506]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[01:52:00.965 --> 01:52:04.348]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?

[01:52:19.701 --> 01:52:19.921]  I think so.

[01:53:00.777 --> 01:53:02.079]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:02.079 --> 01:53:07.666]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:07.666 --> 01:53:12.693]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:12.693 --> 01:53:17.719]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:18.246 --> 01:53:23.469]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:23.469 --> 01:53:25.791]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:53:25.791 --> 01:53:30.594]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:30.594 --> 01:53:31.714]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:31.714 --> 01:53:34.756]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:53:34.756 --> 01:53:38.398]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:38.398 --> 01:53:41.580]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:43.801]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:43.801 --> 01:53:44.742]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:48.376 --> 01:53:51.342]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:51.342 --> 01:53:57.455]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:57.455 --> 01:53:59.840]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:15.563 --> 01:54:19.123]  Gerald Cilente coming up live, joining us via video.
[01:54:20.148 --> 01:54:23.030]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, audio for radio listeners.
[01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:29.215]  You can still get five months free plus at PrisonPlanet.TV, but it won't last more than a week or so.
[01:54:29.215 --> 01:54:32.378]  They always get rid of it by the first week of January.
[01:54:32.378 --> 01:54:36.241]  PrisonPlanet.TV or online at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:36.241 --> 01:54:44.228]  All the books, all the films, all of the different materials are there available at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:50.165 --> 01:54:52.745]  Look, the bottom line is this.
[01:54:52.745 --> 01:54:57.346]  There are evil people in every tribe, every race, every group.
[01:54:57.346 --> 01:55:12.369]  And those evil people always play different groups off against each other via tribe, via race, because that distracts people from the real enemy, which is evil people working together in scams and giant frauds.
[01:55:12.369 --> 01:55:16.990]  And that's what's going on, that's what's happening, that's what we're fighting together as a society.
[01:55:18.953 --> 01:55:21.014]  And you better stop trusting your government.
[01:55:21.014 --> 01:55:23.276]  You better learn how they operate.
[01:55:23.276 --> 01:55:25.057]  Let's talk to John in Colorado.
[01:55:25.057 --> 01:55:26.057]  John, you're on the air.
[01:55:26.057 --> 01:55:30.180]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:30.780]  I'm pretty good.
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:40.266]  Hey, I wanted to ask you, you know, I tell people that a lot of our federal income tax money goes to the Bank of England and they don't believe me.
[01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:42.107]  Is there any truth to that?
[01:55:42.107 --> 01:55:43.108]  You tell them what again?
[01:55:43.108 --> 01:55:48.611]  That a lot of our federal income tax money that people pay goes to the Bank of England.
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.641]  Yes.
[01:55:50.641 --> 01:55:51.522]  Is that true?
[01:55:51.522 --> 01:56:04.397]  Yeah, there was a congressional commission in 1981 that Reagan commissioned them to do a study and they found that 100% of federal income tax goes to interest on the debt.
[01:56:04.397 --> 01:56:09.964]  See, when a dollar is created, $10 trillion in fiat
[01:56:11.056 --> 01:56:15.818]  Loans is made, and the ballot sheets are now computers, that the private banks can loan out.
[01:56:15.818 --> 01:56:21.121]  And the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve are partners.
[01:56:21.121 --> 01:56:25.403]  And so, yes, that's exactly how it works.
[01:56:25.403 --> 01:56:32.627]  Well, you know, I keep thinking how prices keep going up in the United States on everything, and taxes.
[01:56:32.627 --> 01:56:36.629]  Do you think the British Empire, the Queen of England, is behind a lot of this?
[01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:37.389]  Absolutely.
[01:56:37.389 --> 01:56:39.310]  I mean, they're big power players.
[01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:40.031]  Almost as big.
[01:56:41.039 --> 01:56:42.260]  Is Queen Matrix.
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:45.661]  Their holdings are secret.
[01:56:45.661 --> 01:56:48.062]  I mean, it is so mind-blowing.
[01:56:48.062 --> 01:56:52.644]  It's the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the royalty of Europe.
[01:56:52.644 --> 01:56:53.004]  Go ahead.
[01:56:53.004 --> 01:56:55.945]  These guys.
[01:56:55.945 --> 01:56:57.186]  Pardon me?
[01:56:57.186 --> 01:56:59.047]  Like the King of Saudi Arabia.
[01:56:59.047 --> 01:57:02.328]  You know, the big wigs in the world are behind all this.
[01:57:02.328 --> 01:57:03.789]  Yeah, and they all have meetings together.
[01:57:03.789 --> 01:57:06.490]  I mean, you've got all the big royalty together at Bilderberg.
[01:57:07.264 --> 01:57:36.868]  And the Rothschilds and Rockefellers are all there, and they sit around and occasionally they get in fights with each other, but they all agree on keeping the public down, setting up a world government run by private corporations that they own, where there are no checks and balances, there are no freedom, and now they're out in the open announcing world government, tyrannical, authoritarian, to shut off your resources, and they all fund eugenics groups, the Saudis do, the Brits do, the Israelis do, it's just all a nightmare.
[01:57:37.858 --> 01:57:41.960]  It looks like they really do want to kill off a lot of the population.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.521]  That's all they talk about, sir!
[01:57:43.521 --> 01:57:44.901]  They all write books about it.
[01:57:44.901 --> 01:57:52.805]  I am literally like the little kid pointing at the emperor and saying he's not wearing fine clothes, he's naked.
[01:57:52.805 --> 01:57:55.826]  That's why I'm so frustrated, John.
[01:57:55.826 --> 01:57:57.867]  This is not hard.
[01:57:57.867 --> 01:58:01.048]  It's only hard to admit how scary it is.
[01:58:01.048 --> 01:58:04.490]  Well, you know, people always say they and them and those people.
[01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:06.361]  We need more names, you know.
[01:58:06.361 --> 01:58:12.646]  We need to know who are these people doing all this to us, so we can go see them in front of their house and throw rocks at them.
[01:58:12.646 --> 01:58:15.548]  I mean... Oh, that's terrorism.
[01:58:15.548 --> 01:58:16.288]  No, that's not.
[01:58:16.288 --> 01:58:17.009]  That's just defending yourself.
[01:58:17.009 --> 01:58:18.050]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:25.676]  I don't know, but that's how they set up the world, where, you know, the smallest thing is a big freakout, but when they blow up whole cities, it's loving and good.
[01:58:25.676 --> 01:58:26.216]  Absolutely.
[01:58:26.216 --> 01:58:27.237]  I appreciate your call, John.
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:32.084]  We're going to talk about trends coming up in the next year with Gerald Salente.
[01:58:32.084 --> 01:58:36.969]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in one minute when we come back.
[01:58:36.969 --> 01:58:42.495]  And we're going to talk to him about the latest terror attack.
[01:58:42.495 --> 01:58:45.117]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.117 --> 01:58:48.060]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.404 --> 01:58:54.966]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:54.966 --> 01:58:55.867]  Number one.
[01:58:55.867 --> 01:58:59.309]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.309 --> 01:59:00.169]  Number two.
[01:59:00.169 --> 01:59:05.052]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.052 --> 01:59:05.792]  It's true.
[01:59:05.792 --> 01:59:10.355]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.655 --> 01:59:11.476]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.476 --> 01:59:15.078]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.078 --> 01:59:18.981]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:18.981 --> 01:59:19.781]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.781 --> 01:59:22.543]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.543 --> 01:59:26.225]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.225 --> 01:59:27.006]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.006 --> 01:59:31.149]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:35.932]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.212 --> 01:59:40.375]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:47.621]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:47.621 --> 01:59:48.902]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:48.902 --> 01:59:49.222]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.577 --> 02:00:08.338]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.338 --> 02:00:10.079]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.079 --> 02:00:11.660]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:12.601]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.601 --> 02:00:17.423]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.423 --> 02:00:21.466]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.341 --> 02:00:27.623]  And live from New York State, Gerald Cilente.
[02:00:27.623 --> 02:00:33.386]  We're simulcasting the radio show now in the last two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:33.386 --> 02:00:34.186]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:34.186 --> 02:00:40.109]  We're going to get to your calls in this hour, your questions or comments for Gerald Cilente at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:40.109 --> 02:00:43.211]  He can really comment on any issue.
[02:00:43.211 --> 02:00:45.712]  I want to get his future trends for the economy.
[02:00:47.032 --> 02:01:00.777]  Gold, what he sees future trends with the police state, with war, with provocateur events that he predicted in the last year, what he thinks about the underwear bomber, the fact that he was ushered on the plane.
[02:01:00.777 --> 02:01:04.799]  Someone was videotaping him the entire time he was on board the plane.
[02:01:04.799 --> 02:01:07.400]  He was on terror list but ordered to be let on.
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:08.961]  His parents warned the FBI.
[02:01:10.592 --> 02:01:18.797]  The fact that they're now saying they want to attack Yemen and the months before massed US troops in Yemen for a new war there, just like Afghanistan.
[02:01:18.797 --> 02:01:23.040]  We're going to talk to Gerald Salente about all of that today.
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:30.245]  Gerald, of course, really doesn't need much of an introduction, but he is the martial artist of trends forecasting.
[02:01:31.534 --> 02:01:39.697]  And the purpose of Trends Forecasting is to provide insights and directions and anticipation of what the future may bring and to be prepared for the unexpected.
[02:01:39.697 --> 02:01:45.678]  And he, of course, is the founder of Trends Research Institute, one of the top trends researchers in the world.
[02:01:45.678 --> 02:01:47.759]  The website is TrendsResearch.com.
[02:01:47.759 --> 02:01:53.301]  And joining us from his offices in New York State is Gerald Cilente.
[02:01:53.301 --> 02:01:55.101]  Gerald, good to have you here with us.
[02:01:55.101 --> 02:01:56.742]  It's always great being on with you, Alex.
[02:01:57.947 --> 02:02:04.533]  Well, we're about to go to break in three minutes, but out of the gates, what do you think about the terror scare?
[02:02:04.533 --> 02:02:06.635]  Oh, we've all got to be body scanned.
[02:02:06.635 --> 02:02:09.518]  We've all got to be prisoners on the planes.
[02:02:09.518 --> 02:02:14.002]  We have to keep our hands in our laps, nothing in our laps, no electronics.
[02:02:14.002 --> 02:02:15.183]  The government's going to save us.
[02:02:16.823 --> 02:02:23.091]  Well, you know, as you know, we had predicted terror 2010 was going to be an increase.
[02:02:23.091 --> 02:02:33.725]  And as the economies continue to decline, they're going to look for more and more excuses to make the people fearful so that our minds go off the dead economy.
[02:02:34.365 --> 02:02:36.447]  And go on to terror.
[02:02:36.447 --> 02:02:42.273]  And government, of course, is going to pretend that they can save us and protect us.
[02:02:42.273 --> 02:02:44.395]  And of course, we all know better.
[02:02:44.395 --> 02:02:52.983]  So they're going to use any incident, be it false flag or real, to keep gaining more control.
[02:02:52.983 --> 02:02:58.509]  Because as we can see, what's going on here is that Obama is outpushing Bush.
[02:03:01.090 --> 02:03:02.030]  Absolutely.
[02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:03.311]  We got a few minutes before we got a break.
[02:03:03.311 --> 02:03:05.632]  How is he out-bushing Bush?
[02:03:05.632 --> 02:03:07.192]  Well, go to the Patriot Act.
[02:03:07.192 --> 02:03:09.213]  They're bringing it to new levels.
[02:03:09.213 --> 02:03:12.234]  They've increased the war into Pakistan.
[02:03:12.234 --> 02:03:18.556]  Even Bush was hesitant about sending in predator drones into a sovereign country.
[02:03:18.556 --> 02:03:23.438]  He's escalated the war into Afghanistan.
[02:03:23.438 --> 02:03:28.860]  And now, as most people don't know, and you reported about a couple of weeks ago,
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:42.545]  Under Obama's direction, they've been fighting the Yemen war alongside Saudi Arabia, providing them with intelligence, and ostensibly they've been providing air support and cruise missiles.
[02:03:42.545 --> 02:03:50.088]  So he's taking this global war on terror, to really spreading it around the globe.
[02:03:50.088 --> 02:03:54.310]  You predicted two years ago on this show that they would be going into Africa in a big way.
[02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:55.110]  That's now happening.
[02:03:56.038 --> 02:03:59.842]  Yes, and it's very important to watch what's going on in Yemen.
[02:03:59.842 --> 02:04:02.724]  Yemen, of course, borders Saudi Arabia.
[02:04:02.724 --> 02:04:07.129]  The Saudis are in the middle of a fight there in a civil war.
[02:04:07.129 --> 02:04:11.153]  Over a hundred Saudi soldiers have been killed, many more captured.
[02:04:11.653 --> 02:04:24.561]  The point being, if there's a strike on a Saudi oil facility, which is a high probability as this Yemen war expands, all bets are off for the economy.
[02:04:24.561 --> 02:04:27.043]  We're going to get hit with an oil shock.
[02:04:27.043 --> 02:04:29.184]  Forget this false recovery.
[02:04:29.184 --> 02:04:31.266]  It'll go straight toward the Greatest Depression.
[02:04:31.991 --> 02:04:49.045]  Well, over a year ago here, back in October when they passed the Banker Takeover Bill, you and many other economists we had on said that it would be a sugar high, that real jobs would keep contracting, but big banks, insurance companies, they would announce big profits, which they did.
[02:04:49.045 --> 02:04:50.607]  But the real economy's imploding.
[02:04:50.607 --> 02:04:53.109]  Now they're admitting the sugar high's wearing off.
[02:04:53.109 --> 02:05:00.055]  We'll talk about what's happening with the economy and a lot more as we look at trends in the 2010 with the master of trends, Gerald Solente.
[02:05:02.298 --> 02:05:06.259]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.259 --> 02:05:15.121]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.121 --> 02:05:19.762]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:19.762 --> 02:05:30.584]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.204 --> 02:05:40.727]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:40.727 --> 02:05:46.149]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:53.632]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:53.632 --> 02:05:56.393]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:01.573 --> 02:06:05.254]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.254 --> 02:06:08.835]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:08.835 --> 02:06:13.636]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:06:13.636 --> 02:06:20.018]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.018 --> 02:06:22.259]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:22.799 --> 02:06:24.280]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:25.581]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:25.581 --> 02:06:27.822]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:41.710 --> 02:06:48.977]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:48.977 --> 02:06:58.105]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:07:00.779 --> 02:07:03.800]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:09.123]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.123 --> 02:07:11.164]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.164 --> 02:07:16.166]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.166 --> 02:07:17.347]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.347 --> 02:07:18.467]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.467 --> 02:07:20.368]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.368 --> 02:07:21.429]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.429 --> 02:07:23.630]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.630 --> 02:07:24.970]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:26.291]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.491 --> 02:07:31.757]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:31.757 --> 02:07:35.362]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.362 --> 02:07:39.166]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.166 --> 02:07:40.407]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.407 --> 02:07:41.309]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.309 --> 02:07:42.410]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:43.351]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.351 --> 02:07:44.152]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.412 --> 02:07:47.475]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.475 --> 02:07:49.717]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.717 --> 02:07:50.778]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:50.778 --> 02:07:53.700]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.690 --> 02:08:30.702]  Well, the founder and head of the Trends Research Institute, Gerald Salente, joins us via video Skype in this multimedia cast, Radio TV, that we're transmitting today.
[02:08:30.702 --> 02:08:33.585]  One of the last shows of 2009, the 29th day on this Tuesday of December.
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:49.070]  Okay, Gerald Cilente, I want to pick your brain today about the economy, about other trends you see developing, but finishing up with the terror.
[02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:50.092]  What is your gut?
[02:08:51.167 --> 02:08:54.090]  Looking at the way they already had troops massed in Yemen.
[02:08:54.090 --> 02:08:56.973]  They were gearing up for this.
[02:08:56.973 --> 02:09:00.196]  They ushered him on without a passport or ID.
[02:09:00.196 --> 02:09:01.457]  Passed security.
[02:09:01.457 --> 02:09:04.120]  Someone was filming him the whole time he was on the plane.
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:05.681]  People thought that was strange.
[02:09:05.681 --> 02:09:07.463]  Looked like some type of drill.
[02:09:07.463 --> 02:09:10.506]  His father warned people.
[02:09:10.506 --> 02:09:12.928]  He was on the terror list, but that was ignored.
[02:09:14.475 --> 02:09:18.598]  On and on and on, and now, oh, we've all got to accept the body scanners.
[02:09:18.598 --> 02:09:21.199]  Oh, Obama's got to launch new wars.
[02:09:21.199 --> 02:09:26.222]  I mean, if this isn't staged, I tell you, this is the luckiest thing in history for Obama.
[02:09:27.554 --> 02:09:30.535]  Well, again, you know, I don't know.
[02:09:30.535 --> 02:09:33.517]  Because there's always the other side of the story.
[02:09:33.517 --> 02:09:37.279]  And that is the high level of incompetence from the government.
[02:09:37.279 --> 02:09:41.020]  Look who's the Homeland Security Director.
[02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:42.781]  Janet Napolitano.
[02:09:42.781 --> 02:09:44.542]  Are you kidding me or what?
[02:09:44.542 --> 02:09:47.223]  Homeland Security of what?
[02:09:47.223 --> 02:09:48.684]  I mean, look at these people.
[02:09:49.204 --> 02:09:50.785]  You know who these people are, Alex?
[02:09:50.785 --> 02:10:05.512]  Remember in high school and college, the people that wanted to be the class president or the head of the student council, that thought they were smarter than everybody else, and they sucked up and glad-handed and brown-nosed and knew nothing?
[02:10:05.512 --> 02:10:06.732]  Well, here they are!
[02:10:06.732 --> 02:10:09.654]  They're telling all the rest of us how to think and how to act.
[02:10:10.154 --> 02:10:11.574]  You know, is it suspicious?
[02:10:11.574 --> 02:10:12.775]  Yes, it is.
[02:10:12.775 --> 02:10:15.255]  Is the government totally incompetent?
[02:10:15.255 --> 02:10:16.475]  Look at what they're doing.
[02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:18.976]  Katrina Quality Rescue Skills.
[02:10:18.976 --> 02:10:23.697]  They still have a hole in the ground where 9-11 happened at the World Trade Center.
[02:10:23.697 --> 02:10:25.617]  Look at the wars they're prosecuting.
[02:10:25.617 --> 02:10:29.318]  The military hasn't won a war since World War II.
[02:10:29.318 --> 02:10:31.219]  Oh, I forgot Grenada.
[02:10:31.219 --> 02:10:32.999]  They did a great job on that one.
[02:10:33.459 --> 02:10:36.642]  So, I mean, you're working with a bunch of incompetents as well.
[02:10:36.642 --> 02:10:38.624]  So, yeah, look staged also.
[02:10:38.624 --> 02:10:40.966]  There could be collusion.
[02:10:40.966 --> 02:10:46.051]  But, again, when you put the whole mix together, you know, it makes you wonder.
[02:10:46.051 --> 02:10:47.072]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[02:10:47.072 --> 02:10:55.841]  I mean, in every one of these shoe bombers, you name it, some special security person ushers them with fake IDs or no ID right up onto the plane.
[02:10:57.025 --> 02:11:05.169]  And then meanwhile, I've seen old people who look like they're on the edge of death with oxygen tanks literally being screamed at by TSA.
[02:11:05.169 --> 02:11:14.795]  I mean, I won't fly through Houston, George W. Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush Airport, because they literally scream at you like animals and they've got a bunch of
[02:11:16.448 --> 02:11:19.589]  Bunch of people on power trips literally howling in there.
[02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:24.770]  I mean, it is otherworldly how screwed up things are.
[02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:28.111]  So I understand what you're talking about, about the ineptitude.
[02:11:28.111 --> 02:11:37.054]  This just fits so much of the past MO we've seen with staged events, and we know they stage things like Gulf of Tonkin and other events.
[02:11:37.932 --> 02:11:38.813]  Oh, of course they have.
[02:11:38.813 --> 02:11:40.173]  Remember the Maine?
[02:11:40.173 --> 02:11:42.235]  Yeah, I mean, it goes on and on.
[02:11:42.235 --> 02:11:45.297]  And the other side of the story, too.
[02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:53.962]  Who really, do the legislators or the president or the cabinet, they don't care about stepped-up security, what we have to go through.
[02:11:53.962 --> 02:11:54.843]  I hate to fly.
[02:11:54.843 --> 02:11:56.364]  I try to go nowhere anymore.
[02:11:56.764 --> 02:11:59.485]  Because they have their own private jets.
[02:11:59.485 --> 02:12:01.626]  Everything is paid for them.
[02:12:01.626 --> 02:12:03.147]  They go to another country.
[02:12:03.147 --> 02:12:10.030]  They have military attachés picking them up, carrying their luggage, boarding them on and taking them where they have to go.
[02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:13.251]  So this is just another inconvenience, if you will.
[02:12:13.311 --> 02:12:20.257]  That's right, that's why our military is in 190-something countries, because they're butlers to all these corrupt people in Congress.
[02:12:20.257 --> 02:12:28.504]  I was talking to a European Union member of Parliament yesterday and he pointed out that the European Union bureaucrats are exempt from EU taxes.
[02:12:28.504 --> 02:12:29.725]  Did you know that?
[02:12:29.725 --> 02:12:30.486]  No, I didn't.
[02:12:30.486 --> 02:12:31.206]  I didn't know that.
[02:12:31.206 --> 02:12:31.947]  That is incredible.
[02:12:33.166 --> 02:12:36.168]  Well the whole thing, the whole game is incredible.
[02:12:36.168 --> 02:12:46.156]  So as we're looking at this terror strike, or the aborted one, we're looking for 9-11 magnitude terror strikes in 2010.
[02:12:46.156 --> 02:12:55.124]  And when it happens, just like now for example, has anybody asked if this guy, why he did it, what provoked him to it?
[02:12:55.124 --> 02:13:02.450]  Could it possibly be, other than they hate our freedom and liberty, could it possibly be that he's
[02:13:03.365 --> 02:13:07.286]  Maybe disgusted with American foreign policy?
[02:13:07.286 --> 02:13:23.609]  Could it possibly be the hundreds of thousands of people that have been killed in the decades-long war that America's been waging abroad in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and now in Pakistan?
[02:13:23.609 --> 02:13:25.829]  And here's what to worry about.
[02:13:25.829 --> 02:13:27.750]  Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan,
[02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:33.895]  There are 300,000 approximately Pakistanis living in the U.S.
[02:13:33.895 --> 02:13:43.505]  Now let's just suppose for a moment that you had a family member in the Swat Valley, or South or North Waziristan, or wherever else.
[02:13:44.085 --> 02:13:50.468]  And they've been slaughtered either by a predatory, uh, a predator drone.
[02:13:50.468 --> 02:13:58.751]  Of course, they only do surgical strikes on, quote, suspected terrorists, but they happen to wipe out your family in the meantime.
[02:13:58.751 --> 02:14:06.875]  And the Afghan army, again, instigated by the US, waging this massive war where there were more refugees
[02:14:07.615 --> 02:14:20.710]  In South Waziristan, North Waziristan and the Swat Valley, then since the Rwandan crisis in 1994, do you think you'd want to seek revenge?
[02:14:20.710 --> 02:14:25.715]  Do you think you'd have to belong to an organization such as Al-Qaeda?
[02:14:25.715 --> 02:14:27.217]  Or you're plenty angry?
[02:14:27.697 --> 02:14:37.287]  And now you have the means and the wherewithal of weapons of mass destruction to wreck the havoc that's been wrecked upon you.
[02:14:37.287 --> 02:14:43.914]  To do unto others as they have been doing unto you and your family.
[02:14:43.914 --> 02:14:47.458]  This is why we're going to see Terror 2010, and when it happens,
[02:14:50.452 --> 02:14:52.293]  It'll be the same old story.
[02:14:52.293 --> 02:14:54.294]  They hate our freedom and liberty.
[02:14:54.294 --> 02:14:55.734]  And one other thing.
[02:14:55.734 --> 02:14:56.935]  I love the line.
[02:14:56.935 --> 02:14:58.075]  It comes from Obama.
[02:14:58.075 --> 02:14:58.955]  It came from Bush.
[02:14:58.955 --> 02:15:00.156]  It came from Clinton.
[02:15:00.156 --> 02:15:01.977]  It comes from all of them.
[02:15:01.977 --> 02:15:09.100]  We're going to hunt down the terrorists and we're going to bring them back to swift justice or words to that effect.
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:11.581]  Oh, and we're going to catch every terrorist around.
[02:15:11.581 --> 02:15:14.922]  There have been more Elvis sightings than Obama sightings.
[02:15:17.637 --> 02:15:25.064]  Well, expanding on that, if some of this terror occasionally is real, any resistance is dubbed terror.
[02:15:25.064 --> 02:15:28.947]  If you hold your arm up when a cop's billy clubbing you, it's now called terrorism.
[02:15:28.947 --> 02:15:35.433]  Or if they're about to throw you off the cliff and you try to hold on to the edge, it's nightly news, the greatest terror attack in history.
[02:15:35.433 --> 02:15:40.757]  I mean, our media is saying that if Iran is hit and fights back in any way, they're going to be nuked.
[02:15:40.757 --> 02:15:42.139]  It's a new form of warfare.
[02:15:42.139 --> 02:15:43.280]  We attack you first,
[02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:50.330]  And then if you defend yourself, we nuke you and cry on TV and scare our nation of ninnies.
[02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:56.279]  But look, the globalists know when they go in and stir up the Muslims that that's going to cause them to strike back.
[02:15:56.279 --> 02:15:57.662]  It's like going up and hitting a bee's nest.
[02:15:59.625 --> 02:16:01.748]  They get to take the American people's freedom.
[02:16:01.748 --> 02:16:03.791]  So it's problem, reaction, solution.
[02:16:03.791 --> 02:16:06.415]  The elite didn't get in power over being bozos.
[02:16:06.415 --> 02:16:14.066]  And on top of it, if these Muslims really are just attacking us because they're mad, don't they know that when they attack, that makes our military come and invade?
[02:16:14.066 --> 02:16:15.789]  Don't they know that brings in the wrath?
[02:16:17.588 --> 02:16:18.848]  Well, yes, they do know.
[02:16:18.848 --> 02:16:30.172]  What's the reports going out now, however, that there's another report about Israel planning to do a, quote, surgical strike against the Iranian nuclear facility?
[02:16:30.172 --> 02:16:31.472]  That's the other big part.
[02:16:31.472 --> 02:16:31.852]  You're right.
[02:16:31.852 --> 02:16:41.175]  They're kicking all this off for the police state, getting ready to go into Iran because they know there'll be real terror attacks in this country if Iran is hit.
[02:16:41.175 --> 02:16:41.455]  Go ahead.
[02:16:42.537 --> 02:16:44.658]  I want to make this really clear.
[02:16:44.658 --> 02:16:51.801]  If anybody attacks Iran, the United States, or Israel, it's the beginning of World War III.
[02:16:51.801 --> 02:16:54.863]  These are the Persians, let anyone forget.
[02:16:54.863 --> 02:16:59.565]  There are 70 million of them and they're armed to the teeth.
[02:16:59.565 --> 02:17:02.506]  They fought Iraq for eight years.
[02:17:02.506 --> 02:17:08.309]  They didn't give up one inch of territory and lost over a million people.
[02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:11.010]  Anybody thinks that they're going to beat Iran
[02:17:12.156 --> 02:17:15.958]  Well, you know, they're part of the military-industrial complex.
[02:17:15.958 --> 02:17:17.940]  Maybe it's not beating them at all.
[02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:21.622]  Maybe it's just keep making money for prolonged war.
[02:17:21.622 --> 02:17:27.486]  Because anybody in their right mind knows that they're not going to go down in any way.
[02:17:27.486 --> 02:17:28.906]  And this is also important.
[02:17:28.906 --> 02:17:32.669]  We keep hearing about, you know, the great Israeli military.
[02:17:32.669 --> 02:17:34.090]  Israel lost to Lebanon.
[02:17:34.850 --> 02:17:39.215]  They could, like the United States, they could bomb any country into oblivion.
[02:17:39.215 --> 02:17:42.900]  But once you hit the ground, it's a different story.
[02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:48.406]  So, with Iran, nobody's going to be successful attacking Iran internally.
[02:17:48.406 --> 02:17:52.511]  They could bomb it to oblivion, as I said, it's the beginning of World War III.
[02:17:52.511 --> 02:17:53.553]  There's no stopping it.
[02:17:54.053 --> 02:18:08.901]  So if Israel goes in, and again there's those sabers being rattled now in the news, if that happens, we're going to be in for a hellish time in 2010 and probably for the rest of our lives.
[02:18:11.448 --> 02:18:13.429]  Do you believe Israel's going to hit in 2010?
[02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:17.633]  I mean, they're openly making noises saying they may go ahead and strike.
[02:18:17.633 --> 02:18:19.674]  I don't believe so, and I could be wrong.
[02:18:19.674 --> 02:18:23.557]  I only say that because they've been saying this for a number of years.
[02:18:23.557 --> 02:18:29.081]  And I don't know if they're trial balloons to see what kind of response they'll get back from Washington.
[02:18:29.081 --> 02:18:32.844]  Because the latest, it's the same story, every administration, for example.
[02:18:33.704 --> 02:18:40.990]  Every administration tells Israel, no, you can't build any more housing developments on Palestinian land.
[02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:42.071]  You can't do it.
[02:18:42.071 --> 02:18:42.491]  Stop.
[02:18:42.491 --> 02:18:44.513]  It's against international law.
[02:18:44.513 --> 02:18:46.454]  And Israel does it anyway.
[02:18:46.454 --> 02:18:47.895]  And they're doing it again.
[02:18:47.895 --> 02:18:52.319]  There was just an announcement yesterday for 600 more apartment units.
[02:18:52.319 --> 02:18:54.440]  The administration says, no, stop.
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:55.881]  Israel says, do it.
[02:18:55.881 --> 02:19:01.005]  So Israel could be testing the United States to see what their response is.
[02:19:01.005 --> 02:19:02.327]  But always remember,
[02:19:03.047 --> 02:19:12.096]  That the more this country is involved militarily at any level, the less freedoms that we the people have.
[02:19:12.096 --> 02:19:19.023]  The worst the economy gets, and we wrote about this over and over again, when this bailout bubble bursts,
[02:19:20.031 --> 02:19:25.856]  When all else fails, they have no more financial tricks to deal on the table.
[02:19:25.856 --> 02:19:28.178]  The next card they play is war.
[02:19:28.178 --> 02:19:29.940]  And that's what we're concerned about.
[02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:31.581]  I've said it on your show.
[02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:33.663]  I've said it on CNBC.
[02:19:33.663 --> 02:19:35.445]  I say it everywhere.
[02:19:35.445 --> 02:19:43.432]  When all else fails, governments after governments take the people to war to get their minds off
[02:19:44.847 --> 02:19:46.248]  It's small a problem.
[02:19:46.248 --> 02:19:47.849]  All right, Gerald Solente, stay there.
[02:19:47.849 --> 02:20:00.416]  I want to get directly into your trends forecast for 2010 and beyond on the economy, on civil unrest, on the police state, on the health care bill, on so much more with Gerald Solente.
[02:20:00.416 --> 02:20:00.936]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.936 --> 02:20:04.438]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:20:04.438 --> 02:20:06.740]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:07.600]  Don't!
[02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:10.602]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:20:11.022 --> 02:20:16.165]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:20:34.696 --> 02:20:35.876]  Herb K. was right.
[02:20:35.876 --> 02:20:39.058]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:39.058 --> 02:20:40.418]  What have you got to lose?
[02:20:40.418 --> 02:20:44.139]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:20:44.139 --> 02:20:44.760]  Get Herb K.'
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:48.081]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:20:48.081 --> 02:20:48.661]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:20:48.661 --> 02:20:48.941]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:20:48.941 --> 02:20:48.981]  888-352-7726.
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:06.108]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:06.108 --> 02:21:09.335]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.335 --> 02:21:10.758]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:21:11.657 --> 02:21:14.498]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:14.498 --> 02:21:20.520]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:25.582]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:25.582 --> 02:21:35.705]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:35.825 --> 02:21:38.166]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.166 --> 02:21:39.746]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:39.746 --> 02:21:42.207]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.207 --> 02:21:44.327]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.327 --> 02:21:49.489]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:49.489 --> 02:21:58.592]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:01.403 --> 02:22:02.424]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:02.424 --> 02:22:07.969]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:07.969 --> 02:22:08.510]  I get it.
[02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:18.139]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:18.139 --> 02:22:19.300]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:28.006]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:28.006 --> 02:22:31.408]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:31.408 --> 02:22:35.671]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:35.671 --> 02:22:37.272]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:37.272 --> 02:22:40.674]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:40.674 --> 02:22:44.837]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:45.037 --> 02:22:45.937]  You should, too.
[02:22:45.937 --> 02:22:47.098]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:47.098 --> 02:22:50.458]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:50.458 --> 02:22:50.698]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.698 --> 02:22:50.798]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.798 --> 02:22:51.019]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.019 --> 02:22:51.179]  Hello.
[02:22:51.179 --> 02:22:54.279]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[02:22:54.279 --> 02:22:56.380]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of
[02:23:13.186 --> 02:23:16.089]  What does someone like you have to say about the wild food experience?
[02:23:16.089 --> 02:23:20.774]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[02:23:20.774 --> 02:23:25.018]  Dear Linda, I would be hard pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[02:23:25.018 --> 02:23:29.362]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[02:23:29.362 --> 02:23:33.927]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[02:23:33.927 --> 02:23:35.809]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[02:23:36.169 --> 02:23:38.130]  I can't say enough about this book.
[02:23:38.130 --> 02:23:40.051]  Blessings to you and your family.
[02:23:40.051 --> 02:23:45.773]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[02:23:45.773 --> 02:23:49.174]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:23:49.174 --> 02:23:52.776]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[02:23:52.776 --> 02:23:56.778]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[02:24:30.892 --> 02:24:38.935]  I want to remind listeners, Gerald Cilente, for more than two decades, has been devastatingly accurate on his trends and forecasts.
[02:24:38.935 --> 02:24:40.775]  We're honored to have him here with us today.
[02:24:40.775 --> 02:24:47.457]  And of course, when he's up on screen with us, you can see the URL for his Trends Research Institute website.
[02:24:47.457 --> 02:24:48.297]  Gerald Cilente.
[02:24:49.625 --> 02:25:00.591]  Shifting gears now purely into the economy, and of course we know the staged terror and the new wars are about smoke screening that and getting us to rally around the New World Order flag.
[02:25:00.591 --> 02:25:04.373]  What else do you see economically coming up in 2010 into 2011?
[02:25:09.096 --> 02:25:13.459]  As of 2010, the markets collapsed in March 9, 2009.
[02:25:13.459 --> 02:25:29.812]  The only thing that's happened is the world governments, the central bankers, have flooded the world with money to keep propping up the failing banks and brokerage firms to the tune of about $6 trillion, roughly.
[02:25:29.812 --> 02:25:34.415]  But let's look at the real numbers and let's look at what's really going on.
[02:25:34.415 --> 02:25:34.816]  Iceland.
[02:25:35.506 --> 02:25:46.939]  Greece, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, US, UK,
[02:25:48.391 --> 02:25:55.236]  One after another, countries are going under, they're going bankrupt, and they're ready to fail.
[02:25:55.236 --> 02:26:05.765]  And meanwhile, our mainstream media is telling us everything's wonderful, while the big brokerage firms are quietly telling their wealthy investors, hey, you better get ready for a possible total collapse.
[02:26:05.765 --> 02:26:13.351]  Now, when are you saying in 2010, because you actually said 2009, when are you saying you're looking for another implosion?
[02:26:13.351 --> 02:26:17.134]  No, what I meant to say is in 2009, the markets collapsed.
[02:26:17.714 --> 02:26:17.894]  Got it.
[02:26:34.921 --> 02:26:35.742]  Oh, it's okay.
[02:26:35.742 --> 02:26:36.462]  Nothing's wrong.
[02:26:36.462 --> 02:26:37.543]  Nothing's wrong.
[02:26:37.543 --> 02:26:39.324]  That's what they try to tell us.
[02:26:39.324 --> 02:26:43.827]  That's the canary in the commercial real estate mindshare.
[02:26:43.827 --> 02:26:47.649]  We're going to start seeing more and more commercial failures.
[02:26:47.649 --> 02:26:50.791]  And they're going to dwarf the subprime problem.
[02:26:50.791 --> 02:26:54.073]  There's a story worth reading in today's New York Times.
[02:26:54.073 --> 02:26:56.795]  Actually, it's an op-ed piece from a previous story.
[02:26:57.535 --> 02:27:00.257]  It's about the Goldman Sachs gang.
[02:27:00.257 --> 02:27:05.159]  They have, you know, they always tell us what brilliant, the most brilliant minds!
[02:27:05.159 --> 02:27:10.522]  We need, we need to pay a lot of money to get the most brilliant minds in finance.
[02:27:10.522 --> 02:27:16.945]  Yeah, the most brilliant minds so they could pull off the most brilliant criminal schemes possible.
[02:27:16.945 --> 02:27:17.706]  Here's what they've done.
[02:27:18.848 --> 02:27:21.389]  You can't make this stuff up, but they did.
[02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:27.552]  They call it a Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation.
[02:27:27.552 --> 02:27:30.713]  A Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation?
[02:27:30.713 --> 02:27:31.894]  What does that mean?
[02:27:31.894 --> 02:27:38.237]  Oh, what it means is you invest with us and you're going to be guaranteed to get great returns.
[02:27:38.877 --> 02:27:48.421]  So they sucker you in the Goldman Sachs game for you to invest with them, and meanwhile they're shorting the position knowing that it's going to fail.
[02:27:48.421 --> 02:27:50.202]  It's in black and white.
[02:27:50.202 --> 02:27:54.824]  And again, you and many of other great guests we had said this a year ago.
[02:27:54.824 --> 02:28:02.288]  Now it's come out in the five-part Siri McClatchy newspapers that Goldman Sachs engineered this whole thing to destroy their competition.
[02:28:02.288 --> 02:28:07.310]  Internally, they were betting against housing while telling all their sucker customers to invest in it.
[02:28:07.984 --> 02:28:08.864]  That's right.
[02:28:08.864 --> 02:28:19.828]  It would be like you taking out an insurance policy with me, giving me the money, and then me killing you, and then collecting on the policy.
[02:28:19.828 --> 02:28:21.468]  That's what they're doing.
[02:28:21.468 --> 02:28:32.392]  That's what these great minds that we have to pay all this money to, to bail them out, and to keep them like we're doing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Christmas Eve
[02:28:32.612 --> 02:28:36.015]  And of course, it's not really just a bailout.
[02:28:36.015 --> 02:28:37.416]  They made money on the way up.
[02:28:37.416 --> 02:28:38.997]  This is just their profit on the way down.
[02:28:38.997 --> 02:28:40.018]  Go ahead.
[02:28:40.018 --> 02:28:43.600]  Well, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that they did on Christmas Eve.
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:50.605]  We, now the government, has guaranteed them unlimited funds to keep the housing scam going.
[02:28:50.605 --> 02:28:54.208]  You know, nine out of ten mortgages are backed by the government.
[02:28:54.208 --> 02:28:55.029]  And what did they do?
[02:28:55.029 --> 02:29:00.593]  They gave the CEOs of these companies, what, a six million dollar salary?
[02:29:01.073 --> 02:29:06.094]  I mean, come on, but they do it on Christmas Eve when nobody's watching.
[02:29:06.094 --> 02:29:09.735]  So what we're looking for in 2010 is the collapse.
[02:29:09.735 --> 02:29:19.897]  And by the way, when we're looking at the collapse of 2010, we're also looking at the possible breakup of the European Monetary Union.
[02:29:19.897 --> 02:29:24.258]  So, for example, I spoke about Greece and Portugal and Ireland and Spain.
[02:29:24.258 --> 02:29:29.559]  Greece, for example, their budget deficit is 13 percent greater
[02:29:32.335 --> 02:29:33.735]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:33.735 --> 02:29:36.136]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:00.328 --> 02:31:05.635]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.635 --> 02:31:07.718]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:31:07.718 --> 02:31:10.181]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.181 --> 02:31:12.464]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.464 --> 02:31:14.066]  You don't have to cooperate.

[02:32:00.250 --> 02:32:04.792]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.792 --> 02:32:05.713]  Number one.
[02:32:05.713 --> 02:32:09.135]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.135 --> 02:32:09.995]  Number two.
[02:32:09.995 --> 02:32:14.878]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.878 --> 02:32:15.618]  It's true.
[02:32:15.618 --> 02:32:20.181]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.501 --> 02:32:21.322]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.322 --> 02:32:24.907]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:24.907 --> 02:32:28.831]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.831 --> 02:32:29.612]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.612 --> 02:32:32.376]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.376 --> 02:32:36.060]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.060 --> 02:32:36.301]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.841 --> 02:32:40.983]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:40.983 --> 02:32:46.045]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.045 --> 02:32:50.206]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.206 --> 02:32:52.007]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:33:13.422 --> 02:33:16.945]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:33:16.945 --> 02:33:20.969]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:33:20.969 --> 02:33:26.374]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, going back to Gerald Cilente here in just a moment.
[02:33:26.374 --> 02:33:35.023]  I want to remind you we have some of the best deals on books, videos, Patriot Apparel, that is a great way to meet like-minded people out there.

[02:33:54.778 --> 02:33:58.303]  Have some other variants of those shirts up there on the site.

[02:34:19.768 --> 02:34:25.073]  Ecuador Central believes we all have a duty to protect our families and our wealth.

[02:34:54.816 --> 02:34:58.818]  That's spelled E-C-U-A-D-O-R-Central.com.
[02:35:00.655 --> 02:35:14.432]  Okay, going back to Gerald Salente of the TrendsResearch.com, the Trends Research Institute, and we are going over a bunch of different issues with him.
[02:35:14.432 --> 02:35:15.273]  He was talking about
[02:35:16.327 --> 02:35:17.848]  And again, I've got to hand it to Gerald.
[02:35:17.848 --> 02:35:22.811]  I remember him saying about six months ago, look at Europe perhaps breaking up.
[02:35:22.811 --> 02:35:23.972]  It's going to be so bad.
[02:35:23.972 --> 02:35:28.675]  And our government's going to have peaceful revolution.
[02:35:28.675 --> 02:35:31.357]  It's over for them by 2012.
[02:35:31.357 --> 02:35:33.598]  And then I started seeing mainstream news articles.
[02:35:33.598 --> 02:35:34.659]  I saw one last week.
[02:35:35.359 --> 02:35:39.960]  Saying Greece and others may go under, may bring down the European Union.
[02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:47.862]  My issue is the European Union wants them deep in debt, wants them under those controls, so I think they'll just refinance the deals with them.
[02:35:47.862 --> 02:35:53.204]  But continuing Gerald Cilente with what you see happening on the economy, then domestically here.
[02:35:54.634 --> 02:36:03.178]  As the economy goes down, we're going to start seeing, of course, nothing goes straight down or up or down, but we're still very bullish on gold prices.
[02:36:03.178 --> 02:36:05.740]  We believe gold 2000.
[02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:14.344]  What's happened is that as Greece and Eastern Europe has been going under, and of course, Sweden, Austria, the rest have been financing it,
[02:36:14.864 --> 02:36:19.769]  What they're doing is people are bailing out of the euro and then going into the dollar.
[02:36:19.769 --> 02:36:25.896]  Well that's like jumping out of one sinking ship and then jumping into the other sinking ship.
[02:36:25.896 --> 02:36:31.341]  So temporarily we're going to have it look as though the dollar is rebounding.
[02:36:31.341 --> 02:36:34.965]  But this is very important in putting all the pieces together.
[02:36:35.686 --> 02:36:43.293]  With a high probability of when terrorist strikes in 2010, go back to what they did in 2001.
[02:36:43.293 --> 02:36:45.295]  They closed down Wall Street.
[02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:57.166]  If you had certificates of deposit like I did, and tried to get them out of the bank like I did, they wouldn't give them to me because Wall Street was closed and they said CDs of financial instruments.
[02:36:57.987 --> 02:36:59.448]  Trade it on the street.
[02:36:59.448 --> 02:37:07.394]  Now, what they will do this time, because the economy is in much worse shape than back then, we believe they'll call a bank holiday.
[02:37:07.394 --> 02:37:09.255]  They'll close the banks.
[02:37:09.255 --> 02:37:16.340]  That also means that when they reopen, there's a very good probability that your money will be devalued.
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:22.265]  As you well know, Alex, what they did when FDR closed the banks, repatriated the gold,
[02:37:24.086 --> 02:37:32.874]  They made him sell it back to the government at $20, $67 an ounce, and then they re-pegged it, what was it, $35 an ounce.
[02:37:32.874 --> 02:37:35.456]  So you lost 40% of your value.
[02:37:35.456 --> 02:37:37.597]  Your money was devalued.
[02:37:37.597 --> 02:37:40.520]  That's the kind of thing we fear now.
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:43.022]  A financial crisis is looming.
[02:37:43.022 --> 02:37:45.204]  Terrorism is in the wings.
[02:37:45.204 --> 02:37:49.507]  When it happens, they will close down the financial system.
[02:37:50.268 --> 02:37:52.449]  ATMs will close down.
[02:37:52.449 --> 02:38:00.151]  You will only be able to get a certain amount of money back, like they did in Argentina and other failing countries.
[02:38:00.151 --> 02:38:06.133]  And when you get your money back, it'll be worth a fraction of what it used to be worth.
[02:38:06.133 --> 02:38:07.414]  That's what we're concerned about.
[02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:21.904]  And again, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, just to back you up, he said a month and a half ago, when gold was at an all-time high of $1,200 plus, he said, look for the carry trade that's been reversed.
[02:38:21.904 --> 02:38:24.747]  Before it went to Asia, now it goes to America.
[02:38:24.747 --> 02:38:27.129]  Look for that to unwind in the new year.
[02:38:28.090 --> 02:38:33.994]  In December into January, and for a few months the dollar's going to go up, then it's going to dive down again.
[02:38:33.994 --> 02:38:36.416]  And that is coming to pass.
[02:38:36.416 --> 02:38:38.497]  Is that basically what you're saying, Gerald?
[02:38:38.497 --> 02:38:40.519]  That's precisely it.
[02:38:40.519 --> 02:38:43.961]  And again, it's just a short-time readjustment.
[02:38:43.961 --> 02:38:49.925]  But the fact of the matter is, and this is the point, none of the currencies are worth the paper they're printed on.
[02:38:49.925 --> 02:38:54.809]  The European central banks have been flooding the marketplace with cheap money.
[02:38:55.129 --> 02:38:57.330]  And now they're starting to repatriate it.
[02:38:57.330 --> 02:38:59.292]  Here's the way the deal works.
[02:38:59.292 --> 02:39:04.535]  A commercial bank goes to the central bank and they put up collateralized debt.
[02:39:05.816 --> 02:39:09.918]  And then the central bank's loan of money on the collateral that they gave them.
[02:39:09.918 --> 02:39:12.179]  The collateral isn't worth anything.
[02:39:12.179 --> 02:39:13.699]  It's junk.
[02:39:13.699 --> 02:39:15.720]  It's toxic assets.
[02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:18.241]  It's Dubai value.
[02:39:18.241 --> 02:39:26.565]  So now, when they start repatriating, there's nothing too good there to repatriate in terms of unwinding their positions.
[02:39:26.565 --> 02:39:31.187]  So the big collapse will happen, we believe, around springtime.
[02:39:31.807 --> 02:39:35.389]  It happened again with the dot-com crash around the same time.
[02:39:35.389 --> 02:39:39.071]  We're looking for around the same time of unwinding this spring.
[02:39:39.071 --> 02:39:43.614]  It can happen earlier because there are wild cards that no one can see.
[02:39:43.614 --> 02:39:47.996]  And the wild card to keep watching is going to be terror.
[02:39:47.996 --> 02:39:50.437]  Terror is back in style.
[02:39:50.437 --> 02:39:53.819]  Look for the orange alerts, the yellow alerts.
[02:39:53.819 --> 02:39:57.001]  Look for every kind of makeup alert that they could make up.
[02:39:57.441 --> 02:40:04.464]  And Napolitano will be out there, Homeland Security, saying that the situation is under control.
[02:40:04.464 --> 02:40:08.926]  I can't believe they came up with such an unbelievable character.
[02:40:10.711 --> 02:40:23.579]  That's right, and we also have all these different governments saying 300 suicide bombers on planes, thousands of white Al-Qaeda, the militias have linked up with Al-Qaeda.
[02:40:23.579 --> 02:40:27.742]  Now that clearly is staged, and we got the MIAC and Homeland Security reports.
[02:40:28.823 --> 02:40:39.689]  That stated the real Homeland Security system is set up for veterans, gun owners, patriots, the American people revolting against Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan that have been robbing us.
[02:40:39.689 --> 02:40:41.350]  Can you speak to that?
[02:40:41.350 --> 02:40:49.555]  To them trying to use the terror card against the American people and to what you see on the revolt end that you said you've seen coming up in 2012?
[02:40:51.940 --> 02:40:56.724]  We see the revolt really gaining steam because there's not going to be any recovery.
[02:40:56.724 --> 02:40:58.746]  Unemployment numbers are terrible.
[02:40:58.746 --> 02:41:00.287]  And we know they're fudging the numbers.
[02:41:00.287 --> 02:41:02.469]  And that's not... This isn't made up, by the way.
[02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:04.010]  Just look at the facts.
[02:41:04.010 --> 02:41:06.853]  The third quarter GDP reports, 2009.
[02:41:06.853 --> 02:41:07.893]  It came in 3.5%.
[02:41:07.893 --> 02:41:12.097]  The stock market was, oh, jubilant.
[02:41:12.097 --> 02:41:14.439]  They just rose and kept going higher.
[02:41:14.439 --> 02:41:15.600]  And then they readjusted.
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:16.120]  Well, it wasn't 3.5%.
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:16.340]  It was 2.8%.
[02:41:19.545 --> 02:41:20.827]  Alright.
[02:41:20.827 --> 02:41:25.492]  Then they readjusted it one more once, down to 2.2.
[02:41:25.492 --> 02:41:29.256]  As you well know, they're cooking the unemployment numbers as well.
[02:41:29.256 --> 02:41:34.662]  The real unemployment rate, with long-term unemployed, discouraged, part-time, we're looking at 20%.
[02:41:36.244 --> 02:41:46.573]  When winter sets in, remember, you're going to start seeing a big increase in unemployment as the temporary jobs that were created during the holidays start to disappear.
[02:41:46.573 --> 02:41:50.837]  And then look behind the numbers of what kind of jobs are being created.
[02:41:51.857 --> 02:41:54.120]  Hey, you want a job in home health care?
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:56.663]  How about a personal home health aide?
[02:41:56.663 --> 02:42:00.747]  There's a job for $8.20 an hour waiting for you.
[02:42:00.747 --> 02:42:03.270]  Want to stock shelves at Walmart's?
[02:42:03.270 --> 02:42:05.894]  You have that four-year college degree.
[02:42:05.894 --> 02:42:07.255]  Let's put it to use.
[02:42:07.255 --> 02:42:10.078]  Well, they already reported this is the worst Christmas sale since 1979.
[02:42:13.339 --> 02:42:15.241]  Well again, this is what we're looking at.
[02:42:15.241 --> 02:42:22.489]  The jobs that are being created, even when they're pumping the numbers up, the jobs aren't worth anything.
[02:42:22.489 --> 02:42:32.880]  So we're going to, and then, oh by the way, this is another big one, all these kids with college degrees, that their parents said that it could be anything they wanted to be, they have nothing.
[02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:35.001]  They're going nowhere.
[02:42:35.001 --> 02:42:36.421]  It's a dead end.
[02:42:36.421 --> 02:42:38.842]  So now you're putting all this together.
[02:42:38.842 --> 02:42:43.944]  You're seeing the beginning of the Second American Revolution.
[02:42:43.944 --> 02:42:45.385]  It's underway.
[02:42:45.385 --> 02:42:52.388]  It happened with the Tea Parties, the tax protests, the Fourth of July demonstrations, the town hall meeting revolts.
[02:42:52.828 --> 02:43:03.559]  The people going to march on Washington, against big government, of course it's being hijacked by different elements out there, but nonetheless it's still moving forward.
[02:43:03.559 --> 02:43:08.364]  So as we're looking at the economy going down, we're looking at the revolution going up,
[02:43:10.646 --> 02:43:13.328]  And then we're looking at terrorism.
[02:43:13.328 --> 02:43:16.309]  The government knows they're losing control.
[02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:20.612]  When they lose control, they tighten the screws.
[02:43:20.612 --> 02:43:22.893]  And that's what we're going to see.
[02:43:22.893 --> 02:43:26.856]  The screws are going to be tightened in the name of terror.
[02:43:27.256 --> 02:43:28.638]  But how does that play out?
[02:43:28.638 --> 02:43:40.932]  I mean, reading a trends forecaster, which I really respect, you're believing it's not going to work, it'll take a few years, but by them showing their hand, that this is the beginning of the end of this group of corporate criminals?
[02:43:42.236 --> 02:43:44.178]  That's the way we look at it now.
[02:43:44.178 --> 02:44:00.250]  However, if the wild card goes as wild as starting a war with Iran, then all bets are off, because they will keep us in the state of perpetual war.
[02:44:00.250 --> 02:44:03.812]  Look, they're keeping us in war now, even though we
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:08.000]  And again, they
[02:44:28.166 --> 02:44:31.707]  They just put out a new fake report saying Iran had nukes.
[02:44:31.707 --> 02:44:33.567]  That's now been proven to be fraudulent.
[02:44:33.567 --> 02:44:35.028]  They're trying the same playbook.
[02:44:35.028 --> 02:44:39.248]  Gerald, I want to go to calls here, but I wanted to ask you this question.
[02:44:39.248 --> 02:44:50.491]  I'm sure you saw the Bloomberg article a few weeks ago where Goldman Sachs is arming its employees against the citizens and expect lynch mobs, literally the villagers with pitchforks to come.
[02:44:51.692 --> 02:44:54.598]  Again, there are criminals that have committed these crimes.
[02:44:54.598 --> 02:44:57.644]  They can't believe that we're putting up with it.
[02:44:57.644 --> 02:44:59.408]  They know they're criminal.
[02:44:59.408 --> 02:45:01.432]  They know they've been bad.
[02:45:01.432 --> 02:45:02.234]  Can you speak to that?
[02:45:03.035 --> 02:45:07.958]  Well, listen to Lloyd Blankfein, the head of the Goldman Sachs gang.
[02:45:07.958 --> 02:45:10.960]  He has the nerve to say he's doing God's work.
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:13.781]  I mean, you know, these people are delusional in a lot of ways.
[02:45:13.781 --> 02:45:16.343]  Yeah, they know the people are after them.
[02:45:16.343 --> 02:45:20.545]  One of the trends we wrote about a year ago, it was off with their heads.
[02:45:20.545 --> 02:45:22.006]  We saw this coming.
[02:45:22.006 --> 02:45:23.807]  Yeah, they know they're in trouble.
[02:45:23.807 --> 02:45:24.928]  And so is, by the way,
[02:45:25.988 --> 02:45:27.950]  The whole government is in trouble.
[02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:30.672]  They're so disconnected.
[02:45:30.672 --> 02:45:32.013]  And of course they're disconnected.
[02:45:32.013 --> 02:45:32.373]  Exactly.
[02:45:32.373 --> 02:45:43.262]  Even the Democrats on the grassroots, even the chairman of the party is against this health care bill that raises your taxes and cuts your benefits for the insurance companies who wrote it.
[02:45:43.262 --> 02:45:48.186]  The Democrats have now read it and they don't care if Republicans and Democrats don't want it.
[02:45:48.186 --> 02:45:50.728]  Some polls as high as 75% against.
[02:45:50.728 --> 02:45:51.929]  They're still going to pass it.
[02:45:52.935 --> 02:45:54.976]  And they did the same thing with TARP.
[02:45:54.976 --> 02:45:57.056]  They do the same thing with everything.
[02:45:57.056 --> 02:46:05.159]  They cannot gauge the anger of the people because they are living privileged lives.
[02:46:05.159 --> 02:46:09.960]  Off with their heads came about because of the same reason.
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:11.181]  Let them eat cake.
[02:46:11.681 --> 02:46:14.384]  Give them a health insurance policy!
[02:46:14.384 --> 02:46:15.986]  It's the same thing.
[02:46:15.986 --> 02:46:29.560]  They don't have a clue of the anger and the real frustration because, and I say this over and over again, when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:31.583]  And they're going to start to lose it.
[02:46:32.864 --> 02:46:48.015]  But if people are losing it and they start World War III and set up the draft, which they've been getting ready for, and run all these patriotic ads about Al-Qaeda hit us again today, they blew up the Washington Monument last month, you know, we've got to arrest your neighbors, they were criticizing the war.
[02:46:49.349 --> 02:46:53.732]  If everybody knows the government's criminal and robbed them, they're not going to buy this.
[02:46:53.732 --> 02:46:57.255]  And it's going to blow up even worse if they start World War III.
[02:46:57.255 --> 02:46:58.756]  Not necessarily.
[02:46:58.756 --> 02:47:05.081]  You know, people get very fearful, particularly the gutless.
[02:47:05.081 --> 02:47:11.246]  People actually believe that George Bush was going to come right in on the white horse and save them.
[02:47:11.246 --> 02:47:15.789]  Remember, he was going to hunt down Bin Laden and bring him back dead or alive.
[02:47:15.789 --> 02:47:17.751]  How could you get away with such a cheap trick?
[02:47:18.211 --> 02:47:20.532]  So the point is you get away with a lot.
[02:47:20.532 --> 02:47:27.597]  So if they bring this war to levels beyond what we could ever imagine, they'll be in full control.
[02:47:27.597 --> 02:47:35.081]  The flags will be waving, the yellow ribbons will be out there, and it'll be the same lines over and over again.
[02:47:35.081 --> 02:47:37.923]  But the lines are so sophomoric.
[02:47:37.923 --> 02:47:38.624]  I mean, it's just...
[02:47:40.342 --> 02:47:42.763]  Again, they believe George Bush!
[02:47:42.763 --> 02:47:44.104]  I mean, how bad could you get?
[02:47:44.104 --> 02:47:48.566]  After eight years of Bush, Mussolini could have been elected into office.
[02:47:48.566 --> 02:47:50.106]  And they brought in Obama!
[02:47:50.106 --> 02:47:52.467]  They believe this song and dance!
[02:47:52.467 --> 02:47:56.309]  I mean, how could any... It's the presidential reality show!
[02:47:56.309 --> 02:48:00.231]  Yeah, he shoots great hoops, and Michelle does the hula hoop!
[02:48:00.231 --> 02:48:04.412]  I mean, how could you get more sophomoric than that?
[02:48:04.412 --> 02:48:07.874]  And they'll give us some new idiot in three years, some new fad.
[02:48:09.288 --> 02:48:17.491]  Well, if we don't have a new third party, but we're forecasting the emergence of a new third party in 2012.
[02:48:17.491 --> 02:48:30.276]  And by the way, I made my reputation part of it back in 1988 when I had predicted in one of my books, Trend Tracking, that there'd be a new third party and someone like Ross Perot would be that kind of person.
[02:48:30.276 --> 02:48:31.176]  You even said his name!
[02:48:31.909 --> 02:48:35.174]  Yeah, I even wrote the name for some strange reason.
[02:48:35.174 --> 02:48:38.980]  And the same situation is available now.
[02:48:38.980 --> 02:48:40.102]  And with the internet!
[02:48:40.868 --> 02:48:49.471]  What we're doing right now is just the beginning, and it really starts to change now because of technology.
[02:48:49.471 --> 02:48:56.534]  People only watch about two minutes on the small screen a day, but they're watching six hours on the wide screen.
[02:48:56.534 --> 02:49:02.996]  Very soon, it's now, you could plug in from the small screen and have it broadcast wide screen.
[02:49:02.996 --> 02:49:09.039]  We're going to see new news divisions, new news networks, new entertainment networks,
[02:49:09.759 --> 02:49:14.169]  Well, that's what Fox News has already created.
[02:49:14.169 --> 02:49:18.238]  Sites that look like Prison Planet and InfoWars and they admit they're trying to doppelganger what I do.
[02:49:20.779 --> 02:49:22.100]  But they're not you.
[02:49:22.100 --> 02:49:22.921]  And they'll never be you.
[02:49:22.921 --> 02:49:24.382]  You can't copy you.
[02:49:24.382 --> 02:49:27.585]  But we're going to see new news.
[02:49:27.585 --> 02:49:30.988]  People are going to tune in to an internet candidate.
[02:49:30.988 --> 02:49:31.948]  They're more independent.
[02:49:31.948 --> 02:49:35.411]  But listen, I agree with you, Gerald, and I want to take a few calls here, but let me ask you this.
[02:49:35.411 --> 02:49:38.334]  They have the fake neocon.
[02:49:38.334 --> 02:49:41.076]  They have hijacked the rebellion.
[02:49:41.076 --> 02:49:48.082]  But if they ride the peaceful third party into a rat hole, that will only make it explode even bigger the next year.
[02:49:49.884 --> 02:49:53.586]  It may not happen because of the... Again, there's so many wild cards.
[02:49:53.586 --> 02:49:56.247]  What if we don't have net neutrality anymore?
[02:49:56.247 --> 02:49:58.028]  Then our forecasts are off.
[02:49:58.028 --> 02:50:05.832]  And by the way, Australia is now trying to pass legislation that will put them in the same league as China.
[02:50:05.832 --> 02:50:07.392]  So... They say that.
[02:50:07.392 --> 02:50:08.813]  They say it's Chinese style.
[02:50:08.813 --> 02:50:10.154]  That's their quote.
[02:50:10.154 --> 02:50:12.375]  Gerald, I'm skipping this break for stations.
[02:50:12.375 --> 02:50:13.815]  It's a network break, so we can skip it.
[02:50:13.815 --> 02:50:14.576]  I want to talk to Andrea.
[02:50:15.430 --> 02:50:17.011]  Frank, Wayne, Josh and Joe.
[02:50:17.011 --> 02:50:18.612]  Guys, have your quick questions ready.
[02:50:18.612 --> 02:50:25.456]  But I want to ask you, any other quick trends for 2010 and forward you want to drop on us, Gerald Solente?
[02:50:25.456 --> 02:50:27.197]  Survivalism.
[02:50:27.197 --> 02:50:32.341]  And it's not going to the hills with AK-47s or cans of pork and beans.
[02:50:32.341 --> 02:50:33.901]  It's at every level.
[02:50:33.901 --> 02:50:35.262]  Be prepared for the worst.
[02:50:35.262 --> 02:50:37.043]  You always could pull back from it.
[02:50:37.043 --> 02:50:44.068]  I'm most concerned about Terra 2010, the prospects of calling bank holidays, not being able to get your money,
[02:50:44.568 --> 02:50:48.230]  And in having devalued.
[02:50:48.230 --> 02:50:48.910]  Absolutely.
[02:50:48.910 --> 02:50:50.631]  Let's take a call.
[02:50:50.631 --> 02:50:54.893]  Andrea in South Carolina, you're on the air with Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster.
[02:50:54.893 --> 02:50:55.214]  Go ahead.
[02:50:55.214 --> 02:50:57.335]  It is certainly my honor.
[02:50:57.335 --> 02:50:59.116]  Andre, excuse me.
[02:50:59.116 --> 02:51:00.256]  I'm reading way across the room.
[02:51:00.256 --> 02:51:01.036]  Go ahead.
[02:51:01.036 --> 02:51:01.797]  I hear you, man.
[02:51:01.797 --> 02:51:05.659]  I wanted to thank you for waking me up four years ago, member of 9-11 Truth.
[02:51:05.659 --> 02:51:07.120]  My question is this.
[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:12.482]  When we look at this disgusting terror attack, perpetrated false flag operation against the American people,
[02:51:14.324 --> 02:51:18.387]  Can we look at the put options put on Delta Airlines?
[02:51:18.387 --> 02:51:24.070]  Because I checked the stocks last night, and they've dropped off 25% at least.
[02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:31.215]  So, I think these people are so greedy that they bet against Delta, and that will give us their fingerprint.
[02:51:31.215 --> 02:51:32.916]  What do you guys think?
[02:51:32.916 --> 02:51:34.177]  Well, of course they're greedy.
[02:51:34.177 --> 02:51:35.058]  They'll do anything.
[02:51:35.058 --> 02:51:36.559]  They'll sell their mother.
[02:51:36.559 --> 02:51:41.322]  Hey, look what Goldman Sachs does, is they get you to buy things that they're shorting.
[02:51:41.322 --> 02:51:43.003]  So, yeah, I don't put anything past anybody.
[02:51:44.227 --> 02:51:44.727]  Absolutely.
[02:51:44.727 --> 02:51:53.232]  I'm just hoping that if we can get that information out, the actual people who are profiting from this attack, that we can stir up the revolution that we need, man.
[02:51:53.232 --> 02:51:54.413]  We've got to get these people out of here.
[02:51:54.413 --> 02:51:56.514]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Gerald.
[02:51:56.514 --> 02:51:57.674]  Thank you.
[02:51:57.674 --> 02:51:58.355]  Thank you, sir.
[02:51:58.355 --> 02:51:59.415]  I appreciate your call.
[02:51:59.415 --> 02:52:01.416]  Andre, I've got to move that screen closer.
[02:52:01.416 --> 02:52:03.537]  It's like way across the room.
[02:52:03.537 --> 02:52:05.699]  Let's talk to Frank in Ohio.
[02:52:05.699 --> 02:52:06.639]  Frank, you're on the air.
[02:52:06.639 --> 02:52:09.781]  Hey, God bless.
[02:52:09.781 --> 02:52:11.982]  People are being too myopic.
[02:52:12.628 --> 02:52:22.395]  And looking at stocks and things, I want them to envision and put a map, most people don't even realize that Yemen is down at the south end of Saudi Arabia.
[02:52:22.395 --> 02:52:34.804]  And I want people to understand that this is a new world order, global race, and bid for power and power over the peoples and lands of places like Africa.
[02:52:34.804 --> 02:52:38.267]  And well it's that key, key port there right across from Africa.
[02:52:39.369 --> 02:53:08.057]  Well, the bid to take over the areas, the Red Sea, the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, the Arabian Sea, so this is divvying up what... Moscow and Beijing must be laughing their backside off and drinking toast as our own Congress and FBI and CIA destroy and Homeland Security destroy constitutional rights and Bill of Rights and just watch us just implode.
[02:53:10.201 --> 02:53:14.903]  Yeah, we are totally discredited worldwide.
[02:53:14.903 --> 02:53:19.125]  Everybody tried to give us a break with Obama, now they're finding out he's even worse?
[02:53:19.125 --> 02:53:21.766]  And they give him a peace prize to make it a joke?
[02:53:21.766 --> 02:53:26.869]  Isn't this really the globalists setting America up as the bad guy, Gerald Solenta?
[02:53:26.869 --> 02:53:35.113]  I just spoke to a Russian correspondent that one of their colleagues attended the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh.
[02:53:36.514 --> 02:53:43.040]  They were, they could not believe the amount of police control going on.
[02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:52.650]  It made them feel as though they lived in the most democratic society in the world compared to what they saw in Pittsburgh.
[02:53:52.650 --> 02:53:54.311]  This is coming from a Russian.
[02:53:55.165 --> 02:53:56.726]  So that's how bad it is over here.
[02:53:56.726 --> 02:53:58.266]  Yeah, they're testing our police.
[02:53:58.266 --> 02:54:10.290]  They had cops looking for people outside during the day, and old women would walk out with bags out of a shop and go, Officer, I just bought something, and they would release a dog on them.
[02:54:10.290 --> 02:54:13.671]  I mean, how did they turn the cops into demons?
[02:54:13.671 --> 02:54:19.233]  Exactly, and this is what the Russians are saying, that it's where they can't believe this is happening in America.
[02:54:19.853 --> 02:54:27.138]  Now, the other thing that Frank mentioned is where Yemen is, bordering Saudi Arabia, as we mentioned.
[02:54:27.138 --> 02:54:30.020]  Now, they're also, remember the coal.
[02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:32.161]  The USS Cole was blown up.
[02:54:32.161 --> 02:54:33.462]  They got bombed in Aden, yeah.
[02:54:34.588 --> 02:54:41.254]  Now, 25% of the world's oil moves through the straits in that area.
[02:54:41.254 --> 02:54:48.581]  So if we have a terror strike, and again, Saudi Arabia, the US, the Yemen government are all involved in this.
[02:54:48.581 --> 02:54:50.403]  There's a civil war going on there.
[02:54:50.763 --> 02:54:53.004]  It's their second in 15 years.
[02:54:53.004 --> 02:54:55.325]  Rebellions in the North and the South.
[02:54:55.325 --> 02:54:57.606]  Religious, tribal.
[02:54:57.606 --> 02:54:58.787]  It's a mess.
[02:54:58.787 --> 02:55:11.033]  And what they're doing, and there's absolutely no evidence, even coming from the Saudis, saying there's no evidence, they're blaming it on Iran.
[02:55:11.033 --> 02:55:12.353]  So put the pieces together.
[02:55:12.353 --> 02:55:19.797]  I just wanted to point out, if people put the map out and this power under the guise of terrorism,
[02:55:20.293 --> 02:55:29.138]  Watching our poor American and blessed American military, boys and girls, going into country without declarations of war.
[02:55:29.138 --> 02:55:38.243]  We're going to do a power grab in Iraq and on the other side, on Afghanistan, and then run into Pakistan.
[02:55:38.243 --> 02:55:41.125]  So we do see the globalist
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:46.142]  Uh, in there dividing up and conquering and taking over.
[02:55:46.142 --> 02:55:54.208]  And they've got a fake leftist in there to sell the left on going along with a warmonger worse than George Bush!
[02:55:54.208 --> 02:55:59.912]  And putting climate control and taxes, national taxes, on that.
[02:55:59.912 --> 02:56:10.759]  We can see how it's a power, power grab from both the American industrialists and using our boys and girls in military
[02:56:11.314 --> 02:56:13.455]  to do a power grab around the world.
[02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:29.440]  I think it's great.
[02:56:51.414 --> 02:56:53.915]  I think your movies are terrific.
[02:56:53.915 --> 02:56:55.996]  I get terrific comments from them.
[02:56:55.996 --> 02:56:58.578]  I encourage everybody to watch them.
[02:56:58.578 --> 02:57:04.000]  And you're doing what few people do, and I applaud you for the brave stand you take.
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:08.382]  And I also want to mention, we know how difficult it is out there for everyone.
[02:57:08.382 --> 02:57:11.064]  And what we're doing, there's a discount request button.
[02:57:11.604 --> 02:57:17.127]  We try to make the Trends Journal available to everybody at any price they could afford.
[02:57:17.127 --> 02:57:18.348]  So please let us know.
[02:57:18.348 --> 02:57:21.389]  And Alex, keep up the great work.
[02:57:21.389 --> 02:57:35.857]  The feedback that we're getting from your CDs, the Obama deception and the fall of the republic, day after day we get them thanking you and thanking me and thanking all of those that
[02:57:36.417 --> 02:57:47.984]  participated on it for doing our part and giving people the courage to also step forward and to do their part because that's the only way it's going to change.
[02:57:47.984 --> 02:58:03.655]  Well I think there's no doubt at the end of the day we're in a fight for our liberties, a fight for our freedoms, there's a global corporate takeover taking place that uses all these boogeymen to get us to acquiesce to tyranny but thanks to you and many others telling the truth there is an awakening happening and I think time
[02:58:04.631 --> 02:58:07.734]  And history and the truth is on our side, Gerald Cilente.
[02:58:07.734 --> 02:58:11.157]  I think in the end, we're going to beat these people.
[02:58:11.157 --> 02:58:13.840]  We either beat them or we go under.
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:15.621]  And I'm not for going under.
[02:58:15.621 --> 02:58:18.924]  So I say, let's win.
[02:58:18.924 --> 02:58:20.926]  Gerald, thank you so much for talking to us.
[02:58:20.926 --> 02:58:22.308]  We'll talk to you next year, my friend.
[02:58:23.171 --> 02:58:24.612]  Merry Happy New Year!
[02:58:24.612 --> 02:58:25.492]  You too.
[02:58:25.492 --> 02:58:26.873]  There goes Gerald Salente.
[02:58:26.873 --> 02:58:38.601]  We have our special guest coming up in the next segment, in the next hour, fourth and final hour, straight ahead, right here on the one, the only, GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:38.601 --> 02:58:43.404]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.404 --> 02:58:45.905]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.905 --> 02:58:48.067]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.445 --> 02:58:54.467]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.467 --> 02:58:59.792]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.792 --> 02:59:01.833]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:01.833 --> 02:59:06.837]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:06.837 --> 02:59:07.758]  How much do you want?
[02:59:07.998 --> 02:59:09.139]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.139 --> 02:59:11.020]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.020 --> 02:59:12.081]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.081 --> 02:59:14.302]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.302 --> 02:59:15.643]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.643 --> 02:59:17.164]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.164 --> 02:59:22.428]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.428 --> 02:59:26.010]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.010 --> 02:59:29.493]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:29.833 --> 02:59:31.054]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.054 --> 02:59:31.954]  We don't know.
[02:59:31.954 --> 02:59:33.055]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.055 --> 02:59:33.996]  All you can get.
[02:59:33.996 --> 02:59:35.096]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.096 --> 02:59:38.138]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.138 --> 02:59:38.658]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.658 --> 02:59:40.379]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.379 --> 02:59:41.360]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:42.561]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.561 --> 02:59:44.382]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:05.236 --> 03:00:08.298]  Well, they got on a flight from Amsterdam into the United States and
[03:00:35.686 --> 03:00:43.252]  They saw some very interesting things happen on the concourse, in the airport, into the plane, and on the plane.
[03:00:45.353 --> 03:00:53.418]  And of course, he's a lawyer, a really good witness, trained to be able to document and be careful about what he says he saw.
[03:00:53.418 --> 03:00:57.200]  And the other witnesses are saying the exact same thing.
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:00:58.280]  Very, very bizarre.
[03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:06.445]  You have the sharp-dressed man leading the underwear bomber onto the plane through security, saying you have to let him on.
[03:01:06.445 --> 03:01:08.166]  He's from Sudan.
[03:01:08.166 --> 03:01:13.109]  You have someone videotaping, reportedly, the entire flight and aiming the camera at him.
[03:01:13.869 --> 03:01:19.591]  And I kept saying, why doesn't the FBI want to talk to Mr. Haskell, Kurt and Lori Haskell?
[03:01:19.591 --> 03:01:21.731]  And we appreciate him coming on right now.
[03:01:21.731 --> 03:01:27.513]  He had to come on in the last hour because the FBI was there just before he came on with us.
[03:01:27.513 --> 03:01:34.455]  So breaking news there, Kurt Haskell again who was on flight 253 with the underwear bomber.
[03:01:34.455 --> 03:01:35.796]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[03:01:35.796 --> 03:01:36.476]  Hey, no problem.
[03:01:36.476 --> 03:01:36.956]  Glad to be here.
[03:01:38.210 --> 03:01:47.092]  Well, tell us, again, a snapshot of any new developments or what the authorities just asked you about.
[03:01:47.092 --> 03:01:48.112]  Okay.
[03:01:48.112 --> 03:01:54.594]  Yeah, I got a call early this morning that the FBI would be stopping in my office to talk to me sometime today, and they did.
[03:01:54.594 --> 03:01:55.754]  They left a little while ago.
[03:01:55.754 --> 03:02:03.756]  Our interview today was pretty similar to the interview they gave me
[03:02:04.765 --> 03:02:21.114]  Uh, well, we were being detained in customs after we got off the plane with one exception, that I would say, and that was that they brought a stack of pictures they wanted me to look at and identify if I knew various people that they showed me.
[03:02:21.114 --> 03:02:23.075]  Pictures of people.
[03:02:23.075 --> 03:02:25.977]  Did you recognize the Indian man, the smart dress man?
[03:02:26.736 --> 03:02:28.578]  No, he was not in any of the pictures.
[03:02:28.578 --> 03:02:29.458]  You know what I said to them?
[03:02:39.912 --> 03:02:43.013]  Did you guys bring the security video from Amsterdam?
[03:02:43.013 --> 03:02:47.734]  Wouldn't that be a more appropriate way to do this interview while we looked at security video?
[03:02:47.734 --> 03:02:49.475]  I don't think they like that comment from me.
[03:02:49.475 --> 03:02:50.615]  Well, it's common sense.
[03:02:50.615 --> 03:02:52.715]  I mean, you're a successful, smart lawyer.
[03:02:52.715 --> 03:02:53.636]  You're a sharp guy.
[03:02:53.636 --> 03:02:55.296]  But these FBI agents, they're sharp.
[03:02:55.296 --> 03:02:55.936]  They're accountants.
[03:02:55.936 --> 03:02:56.676]  They're lawyers.
[03:02:56.676 --> 03:02:57.877]  What's the deal?
[03:02:57.877 --> 03:02:58.717]  That's what I said.
[03:02:58.717 --> 03:03:01.138]  Did you bring that video with you so we could go over it together?
[03:03:01.138 --> 03:03:02.278]  Wouldn't that be more appropriate?
[03:03:03.107 --> 03:03:06.710]  And I think that was an offensive comment.
[03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:08.031]  Why would that be offensive?
[03:03:08.031 --> 03:03:11.194]  I mean, again, this is all part of the fake make-work.
[03:03:11.194 --> 03:03:13.776]  We saw this with Oklahoma City and other suspicious events.
[03:03:13.776 --> 03:03:21.742]  They'll just bring a boatload of papers and stuff that doesn't matter, and then your information that is so vital will go into the deep six bin.
[03:03:21.742 --> 03:03:29.148]  And that's why I wanted to get you on, Mr. Haskell, but I think you're now experiencing what I wanted to warn you about, about vital witnesses just get ignored.
[03:03:32.015 --> 03:03:41.262]  I kind of want to keep this interview to me being an eyewitness and not me being expert testimony.
[03:03:41.262 --> 03:03:45.345]  Are you talking about with the FBI right now here on air?
[03:03:45.345 --> 03:03:53.492]  No, what I'm saying is I want to keep, yeah, right here on air, I want to keep it to what I witnessed and not so much what my opinion is.
[03:03:53.492 --> 03:03:55.193]  Absolutely, that makes sense to do that.
[03:03:57.173 --> 03:04:02.755]  You know, I'm an eyewitness in this case, not an expert witness.
[03:04:02.755 --> 03:04:10.279]  And I don't want anyone accusing me of having any kind of an agenda to discredit the facts of this case and what I've witnessed.
[03:04:10.279 --> 03:04:12.259]  And use that against me to discredit me.
[03:04:20.908 --> 03:04:21.289]  Exactly.
[03:04:21.289 --> 03:04:23.573]  I'm trying to not do anything to discredit myself.
[03:04:23.573 --> 03:04:24.715]  But there are other witnesses.
[03:04:24.715 --> 03:04:29.783]  We're now seeing other witnesses saying they saw the guy with the camera and everything else.
[03:04:29.783 --> 03:04:30.605]  Okay.
[03:04:30.605 --> 03:04:30.745]  Yeah.
[03:04:32.244 --> 03:04:36.147]  Well, let's talk about what you saw then, because we've got you to the bottom of the hour.
[03:04:36.147 --> 03:04:38.429]  Plenty of time to flesh this out.
[03:04:38.429 --> 03:04:50.778]  Instead of like five minutes on CNN or ten minutes on Fox, plenty of time for you to be able to break down in fine detail what you saw, what you witnessed, and we're really excited to have Kurt Haskell on with us.
[03:04:50.778 --> 03:04:56.842]  His wife, Lori Haskell, was also on the aircraft, bombed by the underwear bomber.
[03:04:56.842 --> 03:04:58.844]  We're glad that he's certainly alive right now.
[03:05:00.717 --> 03:05:06.024]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:05:06.024 --> 03:05:10.550]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:05:10.550 --> 03:05:12.833]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:05:12.833 --> 03:05:14.455]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:05:14.455 --> 03:05:15.497]  There is a solution.
[03:05:15.717 --> 03:05:24.142]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:06:07.745 --> 03:06:09.847]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[03:07:00.526 --> 03:07:05.068]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:07:05.068 --> 03:07:05.989]  Number one.
[03:07:05.989 --> 03:07:09.411]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:07:09.411 --> 03:07:10.271]  Number two.
[03:07:10.271 --> 03:07:15.154]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:07:15.154 --> 03:07:15.894]  It's true.
[03:07:15.894 --> 03:07:20.457]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:07:20.757 --> 03:07:21.578]  Number 3.
[03:07:21.578 --> 03:07:25.181]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:07:25.181 --> 03:07:29.104]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:07:29.104 --> 03:07:29.884]  Number 4.
[03:07:29.884 --> 03:07:32.646]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:07:32.646 --> 03:07:36.329]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:07:36.329 --> 03:07:37.130]  Number 5.
[03:07:37.130 --> 03:07:41.273]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:07:41.273 --> 03:07:46.037]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:08:10.718 --> 03:08:12.299]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.299 --> 03:08:13.861]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.861 --> 03:08:18.064]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.064 --> 03:08:23.889]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.889 --> 03:08:27.532]  Well, Kurt and Lori Haskell had been on an African vacation.
[03:08:28.677 --> 03:08:32.118]  They were over there sightseeing, a sightseeing safari.
[03:08:32.118 --> 03:08:35.999]  Coming back through Amsterdam, things got a bit hairy.
[03:08:35.999 --> 03:08:41.140]  Coming into Detroit from Amsterdam, he runs the Haskell Law Firm, very busy person.
[03:08:41.140 --> 03:08:42.901]  We appreciate him joining us.
[03:08:42.901 --> 03:08:52.123]  He just had the FBI in his office, but he is aware of InfoWars.com, and so we appreciate him coming on the show with all the hundreds of media requests he is no doubt getting.
[03:08:52.123 --> 03:08:57.025]  Okay, just telling the story, but finishing up what we talked about in the last segment, then telling the story, sir.
[03:08:57.705 --> 03:09:07.932]  The first thing you asked, you said, to the FBI was, why are you here interviewing me about this and showing me photos when you have the surveillance footage from Amsterdam?
[03:09:07.932 --> 03:09:09.392]  Finish up with what happened there.
[03:09:09.392 --> 03:09:12.594]  Well, just to be straight, I don't assume anything.
[03:09:12.594 --> 03:09:19.379]  I said, wouldn't it be more appropriate that you brought the video from Amsterdam so that we could go over it together?
[03:09:19.379 --> 03:09:23.721]  And that seems to me like that would be a good starting point.
[03:09:23.721 --> 03:09:25.122]  I didn't assume that they had it.
[03:09:25.122 --> 03:09:26.063]  I actually asked them.
[03:09:27.340 --> 03:09:27.861]  I asked them.
[03:09:27.861 --> 03:09:29.302]  You do have it, correct?
[03:09:29.302 --> 03:09:31.403]  And they gave me no response.
[03:09:31.403 --> 03:09:33.945]  Oh boy.
[03:09:33.945 --> 03:09:34.866]  Right.
[03:09:34.866 --> 03:09:42.672]  I asked them several questions related to things like that while they're here and they refused to answer anything whatsoever.
[03:09:42.672 --> 03:09:49.357]  They said they're here to get information from me, not me getting information from them.
[03:09:49.357 --> 03:09:49.757]  Really?
[03:09:49.757 --> 03:09:53.400]  I thought in an investigation people are supposed to, witnesses are supposed to
[03:09:54.839 --> 03:09:58.400]  You know, bring up anything they think is important.
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:09:59.701]  Right.
[03:09:59.701 --> 03:10:00.261]  Hmm.
[03:10:00.261 --> 03:10:05.063]  Which I did, but you'd think there'd be some collaboration there, but... Amazing.
[03:10:05.063 --> 03:10:09.724]  Did anything else in this interview not go well or seem strange?
[03:10:09.724 --> 03:10:13.726]  Go well or... Well, you know, it was very similar to the one I did in Customs.
[03:10:13.726 --> 03:10:19.368]  You know, basic questions, take me through everything, what did you see, can you describe the people that you saw, etc., etc.
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:33.322]  With one exception is that they had a stack of pictures and they went through them one by one with me and asked me to identify each person or not to see if I saw them anywhere or not.
[03:10:33.322 --> 03:10:36.243]  That was the one difference.
[03:10:36.243 --> 03:10:37.383]  Amazing.
[03:10:37.383 --> 03:10:40.644]  It was about ten pictures or so.
[03:10:40.644 --> 03:10:47.025]  Two of them, two of the pictures were of the terrorist man and
[03:10:48.567 --> 03:10:49.767]  They kind of tried to trick me.
[03:10:49.767 --> 03:10:51.748]  They acted like it was two different people.
[03:10:51.748 --> 03:10:54.629]  Let's see if I would agree.
[03:10:54.629 --> 03:10:57.731]  Oh, well I was going to predict that, but I wanted you to say it yourself.
[03:10:57.731 --> 03:11:02.893]  I mean, if they are trying to cover up the investigation and screw it up, this is standard procedure.
[03:11:02.893 --> 03:11:05.073]  Now they're trying to impeach the witness.
[03:11:05.073 --> 03:11:08.175]  Now I, because they really don't like what you saw.
[03:11:08.175 --> 03:11:11.916]  So we need to demand all of the airport video be released.
[03:11:11.916 --> 03:11:14.097]  Not one video that was shooting a sidewall.
[03:11:16.510 --> 03:11:17.750]  Here's how it went down.
[03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:20.992]  Just so you know, again, I'm not making any opinions.
[03:11:20.992 --> 03:11:23.274]  I'm just stating what I witnessed.
[03:11:23.274 --> 03:11:26.295]  He gave me a picture of the terrorist.
[03:11:26.295 --> 03:11:28.097]  You know, I don't know what his name is exactly.
[03:11:28.097 --> 03:11:29.097]  It's a long muscle name.
[03:11:29.097 --> 03:11:30.498]  I'm just going to call him the terrorist.
[03:11:30.498 --> 03:11:32.459]  I said, okay, that's him.
[03:11:32.459 --> 03:11:34.981]  And then they said, can you identify this guy?
[03:11:34.981 --> 03:11:39.223]  And it looked to me like it was the terrorist again.
[03:11:39.223 --> 03:11:43.486]  And I said, is this some kind of trick where if I answer this wrong,
[03:11:44.341 --> 03:11:55.285]  Uh, you guys are going to try and use some kind of smear tactic against me to discredit me, and they kind of laughed, and I said, uh, it looks like the terrorist again, but why don't you give me a full body shot?
[03:11:55.285 --> 03:12:01.868]  Because, you know, part of myself identifying this man had to do with his entire body, because he looked a little different.
[03:12:01.868 --> 03:12:03.448]  His skeletal form.
[03:12:03.448 --> 03:12:10.351]  Yeah, he's a short skinny guy, and they were giving me, uh, head shots only, and I said, well, why don't you give me a full body picture?
[03:12:11.355 --> 03:12:16.660]  Maybe I can tell you if this is a pterosaur or some man that I didn't see.
[03:12:16.660 --> 03:12:17.420]  Wow.
[03:12:17.420 --> 03:12:19.662]  But they didn't have any of those.
[03:12:19.662 --> 03:12:24.186]  One other picture was kind of funny to me.
[03:12:24.186 --> 03:12:27.349]  They showed me a picture of a man and they said, do you know this man?
[03:12:27.349 --> 03:12:29.891]  And I looked at them and I kind of laughed and I said,
[03:12:31.989 --> 03:12:40.092]  Isn't this the man that had the bomb in his carry-on bag that you were arrested in customs that you refused to admit exists?
[03:12:40.092 --> 03:12:49.576]  They didn't really like that comment from me and had no comment back to me, but I said, it sure looks like it's the man you refused to admit exists.
[03:12:49.576 --> 03:12:50.296]  Really?
[03:12:50.296 --> 03:12:53.018]  I don't know if you read that part of my story anywhere either.
[03:12:53.018 --> 03:12:56.419]  Yes, but flesh that out for folks that aren't aware of it.
[03:12:56.419 --> 03:12:57.960]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[03:12:57.960 --> 03:13:01.601]  When we got off the plane, we were being held in customs for a six-hour time period.
[03:13:02.392 --> 03:13:06.733]  And they brought in some bomb-sniffing dogs after about an hour.
[03:13:06.733 --> 03:13:10.493]  One of the dogs found something in one of the carry-on bags of an Indian man.
[03:13:10.493 --> 03:13:14.994]  Now, this is a different Indian man than the one I saw pre-boarding.
[03:13:14.994 --> 03:13:18.675]  He was a younger man, about 30, age 30.
[03:13:18.675 --> 03:13:23.316]  And he was immediately taken into an interrogation room, held there for about an hour.
[03:13:23.316 --> 03:13:25.976]  He came out and was handcuffed and taken away.
[03:13:25.976 --> 03:13:29.817]  Immediately after he was taken away, we were moved to another location.
[03:13:30.883 --> 03:13:35.324]  Uh, and one of the, one of the FBI agents said the following, you're being moved.
[03:13:35.324 --> 03:13:36.345]  It's not safe here.
[03:13:36.345 --> 03:13:45.648]  You, I'm sure you all saw what happened and can read between the lines and why you're being moved.
[03:13:45.648 --> 03:13:47.428]  Read into, read into that what you will.
[03:13:47.428 --> 03:13:48.729]  Wow.
[03:13:48.729 --> 03:13:55.291]  You know, but, um, nobody will mention it, this part of my story anywhere.
[03:13:55.291 --> 03:13:58.652]  And you know, everyone in the plane or a majority of them saw this.
[03:13:58.652 --> 03:13:59.712]  We're all in the same room.
[03:14:02.034 --> 03:14:04.936]  Again, we're talking to eyewitness Kurt Haskell.
[03:14:04.936 --> 03:14:06.977]  His wife saw much of the similar information.
[03:14:06.977 --> 03:14:10.480]  Other witnesses are corroborating a lot of what they're talking about.
[03:14:10.480 --> 03:14:17.925]  Take your time, because we have the time, then I want to get into what you saw getting on the plane once you were on the plane, the time we have.
[03:14:17.925 --> 03:14:19.206]  I'm skipping the next break coming up.
[03:14:19.206 --> 03:14:20.447]  We have it to the bottom of the hour.
[03:14:20.447 --> 03:14:22.669]  We got 16 minutes.
[03:14:22.669 --> 03:14:29.794]  Any detail, anything specific, I mean, start over, slowly tell, retell what you just told us.
[03:14:31.007 --> 03:14:32.288]  What I just told you?
[03:14:32.288 --> 03:14:33.769]  Yes.
[03:14:33.769 --> 03:14:35.430]  About being in customs?
[03:14:35.430 --> 03:14:36.250]  Yes.
[03:14:36.250 --> 03:14:39.152]  Okay, slowly.
[03:14:39.152 --> 03:14:41.394]  We got off the plane.
[03:14:41.394 --> 03:14:45.837]  We were held in customs in a large baggage claim room.
[03:14:45.837 --> 03:14:51.540]  Held there for about an hour with only our carry-on bags, all of us together, all the passengers.
[03:14:51.540 --> 03:14:56.324]  Bomb-sniffing dogs arrived approximately one hour later.
[03:14:56.324 --> 03:14:58.545]  One of the dogs smelled something in the bag of a 30-ish
[03:15:00.542 --> 03:15:02.143]  What I would say, again, an Indian man.
[03:15:02.143 --> 03:15:06.064]  He looked like he was from India to me.
[03:15:06.064 --> 03:15:09.445]  The dog sat there, like he's trained to do if he finds something.
[03:15:09.445 --> 03:15:17.508]  An officer immediately came over and took the man and took the bag into what I would call an interrogation room.
[03:15:17.508 --> 03:15:21.010]  I couldn't see in the room, but I could see the entry door to the room.
[03:15:21.010 --> 03:15:22.370]  He was there approximately an hour.
[03:15:22.370 --> 03:15:26.652]  I saw him come out about an hour later.
[03:15:26.652 --> 03:15:28.433]  He was handcuffed and taken away.
[03:15:30.163 --> 03:15:39.254]  Immediately after this, we were moved to a different location and an FBI agent said something close to the following.
[03:15:39.254 --> 03:15:41.837]  This isn't an exact quote, but similar.
[03:15:41.837 --> 03:15:45.021]  You're being moved to a new location because it's not safe here.
[03:15:45.021 --> 03:15:48.805]  I'm sure you all saw what happened and can read between the lines on why you're being moved.
[03:15:50.253 --> 03:15:53.915]  Now they were probably taking one of their handlers or agents off the plane.
[03:15:53.915 --> 03:15:55.456]  This is devastating info.
[03:15:55.456 --> 03:16:01.500]  And Mr. Haskell, you've been trying to tell the mainstream media that information.
[03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:06.863]  You know, I tell the same story to everyone unless they just want to ask me specific questions.
[03:16:06.863 --> 03:16:08.724]  You know, if they want to do that, that's fine.
[03:16:08.724 --> 03:16:12.626]  But the point is you've been trying to tell this and it's been filtered out.
[03:16:12.626 --> 03:16:13.707]  I'm sorry?
[03:16:13.707 --> 03:16:15.508]  But you've been trying to get this information out.
[03:16:16.124 --> 03:16:19.985]  Well, you know, I just tell my story, what's done with it.
[03:16:19.985 --> 03:16:21.726]  I understand, but I mean, you made the point.
[03:16:21.726 --> 03:16:24.026]  I haven't seen this anywhere in the media.
[03:16:24.026 --> 03:16:25.107]  This is big news.
[03:16:25.107 --> 03:16:27.267]  Well, I know, I know that.
[03:16:27.267 --> 03:16:32.609]  I've repeated that same story to countless news agencies.
[03:16:32.609 --> 03:16:42.272]  Now, not all of them, because some of them just want to do a two or three minute blurb on me, and you know what I saw when it was going on, or Mr. Sharp Trust Man, or what have you.
[03:16:42.272 --> 03:16:45.033]  But, to my knowledge, not one
[03:16:46.016 --> 03:16:50.378]  Media source has reported this incident in custom.
[03:16:50.378 --> 03:16:51.359]  Not one.
[03:16:51.359 --> 03:16:54.260]  To my knowledge.
[03:16:54.260 --> 03:16:55.441]  Yeah, this stinks.
[03:16:55.441 --> 03:16:56.441]  This stinks to high heaven.
[03:16:56.441 --> 03:16:58.842]  I know you're just robotically giving us the facts.
[03:16:58.842 --> 03:17:00.963]  As a good lawyer, you understand that.
[03:17:00.963 --> 03:17:02.444]  I can obviously speculate.
[03:17:02.444 --> 03:17:05.025]  This is really stinking to high heaven as a cover-up.
[03:17:05.025 --> 03:17:05.766]  A cover-up of what?
[03:17:05.766 --> 03:17:06.546]  We're not sure.
[03:17:06.546 --> 03:17:10.268]  Now expanding here, going to the beginning.
[03:17:11.067 --> 03:17:13.108]  Or any other bombshells you want to drop on us.
[03:17:13.108 --> 03:17:15.748]  But going back to the beginning, more about this sharp-dressed man.
[03:17:15.748 --> 03:17:19.970]  More about how he was getting him on the aircraft with these international flights.
[03:17:19.970 --> 03:17:21.570]  You've got to show the passport again.
[03:17:21.570 --> 03:17:23.551]  I've done that myself many times.
[03:17:23.551 --> 03:17:24.551]  You know, at the gate.
[03:17:24.551 --> 03:17:25.911]  This doesn't happen.
[03:17:25.911 --> 03:17:28.152]  Why was this guy given such deference?
[03:17:28.152 --> 03:17:29.872]  Did he look like security?
[03:17:29.872 --> 03:17:31.213]  Did he flash anything?
[03:17:31.213 --> 03:17:32.693]  Go back to the time.
[03:17:32.693 --> 03:17:34.254]  Slowly tell us what you saw.
[03:17:34.254 --> 03:17:38.835]  And then, anything interesting about the underwear bomber himself?
[03:17:40.248 --> 03:17:40.868]  Okay.
[03:17:40.868 --> 03:17:44.831]  So, before we boarded, obviously we were in Amsterdam.
[03:17:44.831 --> 03:17:56.258]  It was just my wife and I. There weren't any seats in the boarding area, so we sat on the floor by what I would call the ticket agent, the last person that checks your boarding pass before you board the plane.
[03:17:56.258 --> 03:17:59.860]  We were about 10 feet away or so, just playing cards.
[03:17:59.860 --> 03:18:09.866]  And, you know, passing time, and I was kind of people-watching, and I saw these two men approach the ticket agent, and they just kind of caught my eye because it seemed strange to me that they were together.
[03:18:10.655 --> 03:18:20.021]  Uh, one I would describe as, uh, he looked like he was a poor, uh, a black teenager is how I would describe him.
[03:18:20.021 --> 03:18:23.323]  16, 17 years old or so.
[03:18:23.323 --> 03:18:25.245]  What I thought was 16 or 17 years old.
[03:18:25.245 --> 03:18:27.266]  And the other man looked like a 50-ish.
[03:18:27.266 --> 03:18:28.687]  He looked wealthy.
[03:18:28.687 --> 03:18:34.270]  Indian, what I would say Indian man now, you know, whether he's of a similar race or something, I don't know.
[03:18:34.270 --> 03:18:37.653]  But to me, it looked like he was from India.
[03:18:37.653 --> 03:18:39.814]  And, uh, they approached this ticket agent together.
[03:18:40.496 --> 03:18:43.197]  It was quiet and I could hear the entire conversation.
[03:18:43.197 --> 03:18:45.478]  Only the Indian man spoke, not the black man.
[03:18:45.478 --> 03:18:48.339]  And what he said was, this man needs to board the plane.
[03:18:48.339 --> 03:18:50.600]  He doesn't have a passport.
[03:18:50.600 --> 03:18:56.002]  The ticket agent then responded, well, if you don't have a passport, you can't board the plane.
[03:18:56.002 --> 03:19:00.143]  And then the Indian man responded, he's from Sudan.
[03:19:00.143 --> 03:19:01.884]  We do this all the time.
[03:19:01.884 --> 03:19:06.826]  And the ticket agent then said, well, you'll need to talk to my manager or something along those lines.
[03:19:06.826 --> 03:19:09.607]  And pointed the two men down a hallway to go speak to the manager.
[03:19:10.533 --> 03:19:12.074]  They then proceeded down the hallway.
[03:19:12.074 --> 03:19:15.676]  This was the only time I saw this particular Indian man.
[03:19:15.676 --> 03:19:21.139]  This was the only time I saw the black man until he tried to blow up our plane a few hours later.
[03:19:21.139 --> 03:19:25.821]  Okay, going back, so you must have gotten on the plane before him or something.
[03:19:25.821 --> 03:19:27.682]  You didn't see how he got on.
[03:19:27.682 --> 03:19:35.946]  No, because shortly after this, shortly after they went down the hallway, we boarded the plane.
[03:19:35.946 --> 03:19:36.386]  And then, wow.
[03:19:39.002 --> 03:19:42.064]  And obviously, everyone should be talking.
[03:19:42.064 --> 03:19:43.825]  It should be all over the news.
[03:19:43.825 --> 03:19:45.466]  Who was the mystery man?
[03:19:45.466 --> 03:19:47.307]  Who could get through security?
[03:19:47.307 --> 03:19:48.688]  Who could bring this guy in?
[03:19:48.688 --> 03:19:55.571]  Who could get people on airplanes without passports, international flights, into the United States, some of the highest security in the world?
[03:19:55.571 --> 03:20:00.274]  I mean, this just gets crazier and crazier, Mr. Haskell.
[03:20:00.274 --> 03:20:02.755]  Uh-oh.
[03:20:02.755 --> 03:20:05.177]  We just lost his phone line.
[03:20:05.177 --> 03:20:07.158]  Connection to Michigan.
[03:20:09.961 --> 03:20:15.325]  Oh, only seems to happen at times like that.
[03:20:15.325 --> 03:20:21.670]  And if you don't think they're surveilling Mr. Haskell, you're living on another planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:22.690]  Oh, doesn't matter.
[03:20:22.690 --> 03:20:25.993]  The info's out.
[03:20:25.993 --> 03:20:33.978]  I've had some private conversations with Mr. Haskell, but I do wear a journalist hat as part of what I do.
[03:20:33.978 --> 03:20:34.999]  I'm also a filmmaker.
[03:20:34.999 --> 03:20:37.801]  I do editorialize as well.
[03:20:37.801 --> 03:20:38.662]  Also preach a bit.
[03:20:40.100 --> 03:20:49.902]  Some say rabble-rouse, but I do wear a journalist hat and what is said in confidence is said in confidence.
[03:20:49.902 --> 03:20:53.243]  Absolutely amazing that that just happened.
[03:20:53.243 --> 03:20:54.824]  Okay, we have Mr. Haskell back.
[03:20:54.824 --> 03:20:56.464]  Hopefully we can keep him for the last 10 minutes.
[03:20:56.464 --> 03:20:58.404]  Mr. Haskell, sorry you got cut off.
[03:20:58.404 --> 03:21:00.245]  No problem.
[03:21:00.245 --> 03:21:04.366]  Okay, we were getting up to the point, just briefly, of
[03:21:06.178 --> 03:21:08.039]  How could this person get him on the plane?
[03:21:08.039 --> 03:21:14.021]  I mean, what gravitas did he have with airport security?
[03:21:14.021 --> 03:21:15.181]  You're asking me?
[03:21:15.181 --> 03:21:16.521]  Yes, sir.
[03:21:16.521 --> 03:21:26.085]  I really don't want to speculate on it other than, you know, I can see three possibilities, and which one you think it was, I don't know.
[03:21:26.085 --> 03:21:29.846]  Three would be, there was a bribe.
[03:21:30.714 --> 03:21:36.836]  There was some sort of personal relationship between this man and the security manager.
[03:21:36.836 --> 03:21:46.319]  And number three would be that this is a regular routine procedure to get on planes without a passport for refugees of war-torn countries.
[03:21:46.319 --> 03:21:46.959]  Well, it's not.
[03:21:46.959 --> 03:21:50.000]  They've got to get special letters from the embassy.
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:53.461]  Pick which one of the three you think it is.
[03:21:53.461 --> 03:21:54.842]  To me, those are the only choices.
[03:21:55.755 --> 03:22:02.477]  Or he was a intelligence agent telling the young fool he was part of a drill.
[03:22:02.477 --> 03:22:05.639]  Okay.
[03:22:05.639 --> 03:22:06.739]  Wow.
[03:22:06.739 --> 03:22:12.861]  Okay, once you're on the plane, you're coming into Detroit, what happens next?
[03:22:12.861 --> 03:22:14.542]  It was a really uneventful flight.
[03:22:14.542 --> 03:22:17.463]  We're in the middle of our descent into Detroit.
[03:22:17.463 --> 03:22:22.144]  The pilot comes on, the speaker, and he says we have 10 minutes to landing.
[03:22:22.144 --> 03:22:23.845]  Flight crew, take your seats and buckle up.
[03:22:24.830 --> 03:22:32.594]  A flight attendant walks by my seat, mumbling to herself, something smells like smoke.
[03:22:32.594 --> 03:22:33.254]  I look up.
[03:22:33.254 --> 03:22:40.838]  I'd previously been looking at the monitor on the back of the seat in front of me to get the flight conditions and everything, because I like to watch that when we're landing.
[03:22:40.838 --> 03:22:42.479]  I looked up.
[03:22:42.479 --> 03:22:44.360]  I'm in row 27.
[03:22:44.360 --> 03:22:47.161]  I could see smoke coming from row 19, eight rows up.
[03:22:48.358 --> 03:22:50.639]  It wasn't a lot of smoke at that time.
[03:22:50.639 --> 03:22:55.601]  It looked like it was coming from the floor, but I couldn't see the floor because I was sitting down.
[03:22:55.601 --> 03:23:07.185]  So I unbuckled my seatbelt, took a few steps up the aisle to get a better look, and then it burst into flames across the floor of the seats and up the wall to the ceiling.
[03:23:07.185 --> 03:23:15.208]  Just in row 19 and just to the seats left of the left aisle, which I think there were three seats, A, B, and C.
[03:23:17.982 --> 03:23:28.092]  When it burst into flames, people were screaming, fire, fire, terrorists, water, water, water, we need water, somebody get water.
[03:23:28.092 --> 03:23:29.453]  Flight attendants were screaming.
[03:23:29.453 --> 03:23:34.098]  The pilot comes on the intercom and says emergency landing and starts speeding up.
[03:23:34.098 --> 03:23:38.282]  And while this is going on, the terrorist man is being hauled off into the first class area.
[03:23:39.071 --> 03:23:41.294]  I didn't see that so I can't confirm that.
[03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:57.290]  Okay, good.
[03:23:57.290 --> 03:23:58.890]  I mean, I hope that's not true.
[03:23:58.890 --> 03:24:02.471]  They were so foolish, they wanted to wait for orders.
[03:24:02.471 --> 03:24:04.392]  But, okay, continuing.
[03:24:04.392 --> 03:24:06.592]  So they drag him up into first class.
[03:24:06.592 --> 03:24:10.293]  Now, did you hear this popping noise, or how loud was it?
[03:24:10.293 --> 03:24:15.414]  Because we heard about this big explosion, and then it was just a popping, and then people thought it was a firecracker.
[03:24:15.414 --> 03:24:15.934]  Okay.
[03:24:15.934 --> 03:24:17.634]  Honestly, I didn't hear a thing.
[03:24:17.634 --> 03:24:21.835]  I asked my wife if she heard anything, and this is what she says about it.
[03:24:21.835 --> 03:24:25.636]  It sounded like what I thought was the landing gear coming out.
[03:24:26.098 --> 03:24:36.142]  And then she said, I heard like a little popping noise after that, but I just thought it was ice breaking off from the opening of the landing gear because we had been in really cold weather.
[03:24:36.142 --> 03:24:38.543]  And she said, you know, I thought that's what it was.
[03:24:38.543 --> 03:24:39.624]  I didn't think anything of it.
[03:24:39.624 --> 03:24:41.885]  But myself, I didn't hear a thing, to be honest.
[03:24:44.893 --> 03:24:45.794]  Absolutely.
[03:24:45.794 --> 03:24:51.540]  Well, there are so many things, Mr. Haskell, to talk about here.
[03:24:51.540 --> 03:24:54.843]  In the last few minutes we've got, and I want to say bye to you during the break.
[03:24:54.843 --> 03:24:55.944]  I know you've got to go.
[03:24:55.944 --> 03:24:57.506]  We appreciate this time.
[03:24:57.506 --> 03:25:00.028]  In the last five minutes, any other points you'd like to make?
[03:25:00.028 --> 03:25:02.311]  Any key issues that haven't been discussed?
[03:25:02.311 --> 03:25:06.114]  And as a concerned citizen who could have been killed by this,
[03:25:06.835 --> 03:25:11.859]  As a free person, I mean, you do have a right to make any statements you want about the investigation.
[03:25:11.859 --> 03:25:15.462]  We are five days into this and we've not seen any surveillance footage.
[03:25:15.462 --> 03:25:23.569]  The media doesn't seem concerned about eyewitnesses seeing a man videotaping the whole flight aimed at this guy.
[03:25:23.569 --> 03:25:26.672]  That's obviously an accomplice or a handler or something.
[03:25:26.672 --> 03:25:28.954]  We've got this other guy getting him through security.
[03:25:28.954 --> 03:25:30.415]  I mean, any other comments?
[03:25:34.236 --> 03:25:36.158]  Just a couple things.
[03:25:36.158 --> 03:25:41.722]  I thought the security after getting off the plane was a complete embarrassment.
[03:25:41.722 --> 03:25:50.988]  A total disorganizational mess that actually put us in more jeopardy than we were already in.
[03:25:50.988 --> 03:25:52.470]  Just quickly, two things.
[03:25:52.470 --> 03:25:59.615]  They left us on the plane for 20 minutes after we landed, not knowing if there was a bomb anywhere or whether the fire had spread below the floor.
[03:26:00.505 --> 03:26:03.227]  Uh, into the cargo hold or by the gas tank.
[03:26:03.227 --> 03:26:06.449]  The original fire was directly above the gas tank.
[03:26:06.449 --> 03:26:09.310]  Uh, in row 19, seat 19A.
[03:26:09.310 --> 03:26:10.071]  Uh, number one.
[03:26:10.071 --> 03:26:22.878]  Number two, they should not have let us take our carry-on bags off the plane, and then even worse, stand all together with them for an hour before the bomb-sniffing dogs got there, not knowing if there was a bomb in any of the bags or not.
[03:26:22.878 --> 03:26:27.781]  And it looks like what appeared to be a bomb was discovered by one of the dogs, so...
[03:26:28.291 --> 03:26:35.732]  Those two things made us considerably less safe than we should have been due to what I would call a disorganizational mess.
[03:26:35.732 --> 03:26:40.013]  It appeared that none of the security officers had any clue on any procedure, what to do.
[03:26:40.013 --> 03:26:41.674]  They didn't know who was in charge.
[03:26:41.674 --> 03:26:50.835]  It really took a long time to organize themselves and organize some sort of procedure on how to handle things, and in the meantime put us in a lot of jeopardy.
[03:26:50.835 --> 03:26:54.316]  Okay, well... And if you want to question me on anything else, feel free.
[03:26:54.824 --> 03:27:03.669]  Well let me do that here at the end and hopefully we can have you back up a little bit in the days to come because you are and your wife are key eyewitnesses and again it's being confirmed by other people on the plane.
[03:27:03.669 --> 03:27:07.812]  We're going to play the clip after you leave saying this guy was videotaping the whole flight.
[03:27:07.812 --> 03:27:09.173]  They've given multiple interviews.
[03:27:09.173 --> 03:27:10.854]  Very suspicious there.
[03:27:10.854 --> 03:27:14.776]  I've been given a quote here from you being interviewed on a radio show.
[03:27:14.776 --> 03:27:16.317]  I want to find out if this is accurate.
[03:27:16.317 --> 03:27:19.619]  You did tell me that you visited Infowars.com from time to time.
[03:27:19.619 --> 03:27:19.899]  I did.
[03:27:19.899 --> 03:27:21.741]  And I understand this is separate.
[03:27:22.601 --> 03:27:31.709]  I want all the information to be public, put in the public, to inform the public, and to help law enforcement do whatever they can to solve this crisis.
[03:27:31.709 --> 03:27:43.800]  Eight years later, I am still irritated with 9-11 when I consider it to be a 9-11 cover-up, and I personally have knowledge with this terrorist attack, and I am not going to let anybody cover up what I know.
[03:27:43.800 --> 03:27:48.104]  Kurt Haskell, attorney, is that an accurate quote, and where was that said?
[03:27:50.037 --> 03:27:58.204]  It's an accurate quote, but I don't want to get into any more detail on that because I don't want any kind of smear campaign against myself to discredit this story, which is
[03:27:58.812 --> 03:28:00.233]  An entirely separate story.
[03:28:00.233 --> 03:28:00.913]  No, I understand.
[03:28:00.913 --> 03:28:02.134]  Well, there's other witnesses.
[03:28:02.134 --> 03:28:04.375]  They've got to release the surveillance footage.
[03:28:04.375 --> 03:28:06.956]  Other people are confirming things that happened.
[03:28:06.956 --> 03:28:09.497]  I mean, we know his dad warned everybody.
[03:28:09.497 --> 03:28:11.178]  We know he was on the terror list.
[03:28:11.178 --> 03:28:13.539]  He fits the classic M.O.
[03:28:13.539 --> 03:28:15.020]  of a decoy, of a patsy.
[03:28:15.020 --> 03:28:19.803]  I know you're just stating the facts, but they're not going to be able to ignore you and your wife's testimony.
[03:28:19.803 --> 03:28:24.005]  And I think it's important for you to go public now, which you've done.
[03:28:24.005 --> 03:28:27.827]  But just thank God that there's so many informed people out there.
[03:28:28.467 --> 03:28:31.369]  Kurt, bottom line, the FBI showed up.
[03:28:31.369 --> 03:28:37.173]  They were clearly trying to impeach your... I mean, they're clearly already aware of you.
[03:28:37.173 --> 03:28:40.996]  They're clearly upset by having a... I would say you are an expert witness.
[03:28:40.996 --> 03:28:42.957]  You're aware of this type of chicanery.
[03:28:42.957 --> 03:28:45.819]  You're a successful lawyer.
[03:28:45.819 --> 03:28:50.462]  Watch your six, is all I'm telling you.
[03:28:50.462 --> 03:28:52.623]  I'm not scared of anybody, you know.
[03:28:52.623 --> 03:28:54.525]  Whatever happens, happens.
[03:28:54.525 --> 03:28:56.766]  We need to get your wife on the air, too.
[03:28:58.103 --> 03:29:02.326]  Just so you know, my wife is very ill today.
[03:29:02.326 --> 03:29:08.611]  She's come down with a bad case of the flu and she's really not doing any interviews today.
[03:29:08.611 --> 03:29:13.014]  She fell very ill after that.
[03:29:13.014 --> 03:29:15.596]  Not from the interview, just she's pretty sick today.
[03:29:15.868 --> 03:29:16.809]  No, I understand.
[03:29:16.809 --> 03:29:17.750]  Air travel can do that.
[03:29:17.750 --> 03:29:19.131]  Obviously, a stressful event.
[03:29:19.131 --> 03:29:20.932]  Well, we appreciate your courage.
[03:29:20.932 --> 03:29:27.857]  We appreciate you telling everybody in a great, very focused fashion, very accurate fashion, what happened.
[03:29:27.857 --> 03:29:29.339]  And we're all praying for you.
[03:29:29.339 --> 03:29:32.481]  Kurt Haskell, attorney, let me say bye to you during this break.
[03:29:32.481 --> 03:29:37.545]  Obviously, listeners, this is an extremely powerful interview, breaking news.
[03:29:37.545 --> 03:29:39.166]  You're hearing a lot of this here.
[03:29:39.166 --> 03:29:42.209]  First, great job to my team getting Mr. Haskell on.
[03:29:42.209 --> 03:29:44.090]  Let me say bye to Mr. Haskell during the break.
[03:29:44.090 --> 03:29:44.791]  We'll come back with more.
[03:29:51.556 --> 03:29:55.489]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.489 --> 03:29:58.178]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.912 --> 03:30:06.873]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:06.873 --> 03:30:15.735]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:30:15.735 --> 03:30:20.376]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:30:20.376 --> 03:30:31.178]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:30:31.818 --> 03:30:41.321]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:41.321 --> 03:30:46.763]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:30:46.763 --> 03:30:54.246]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:54.246 --> 03:30:56.987]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[03:31:02.088 --> 03:31:06.112]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:06.112 --> 03:31:09.354]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:09.354 --> 03:31:14.158]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:14.158 --> 03:31:20.564]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:20.564 --> 03:31:22.806]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:31:23.326 --> 03:31:23.626]  Tim Geithner?
[03:31:23.626 --> 03:31:24.127]  Bernanke?
[03:31:24.127 --> 03:31:24.807]  They're arsonists!
[03:31:24.807 --> 03:31:26.088]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:26.088 --> 03:31:28.330]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:42.219 --> 03:31:49.507]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:49.507 --> 03:31:58.617]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:32:01.343 --> 03:32:04.346]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:32:04.346 --> 03:32:09.671]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:32:09.671 --> 03:32:11.732]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:32:11.732 --> 03:32:16.737]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:32:16.737 --> 03:32:17.658]  How much do you want?
[03:32:17.898 --> 03:32:19.019]  When do you want it?
[03:32:19.019 --> 03:32:20.920]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:32:20.920 --> 03:32:21.981]  When will you need it?
[03:32:21.981 --> 03:32:24.182]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:32:24.182 --> 03:32:25.523]  Will there be any food?
[03:32:25.523 --> 03:32:27.064]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:32:27.064 --> 03:32:32.328]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:32:32.328 --> 03:32:35.910]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:32:35.910 --> 03:32:39.373]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:32:39.713 --> 03:32:40.954]  How much will you need?
[03:32:40.954 --> 03:32:41.855]  We don't know.
[03:32:41.855 --> 03:32:42.955]  How much do you want?
[03:32:42.955 --> 03:32:43.896]  All you can get.
[03:32:43.896 --> 03:32:44.977]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:32:44.977 --> 03:32:48.019]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:32:48.019 --> 03:32:49.800]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:32:49.800 --> 03:32:50.721]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:33:21.906 --> 03:33:24.167]  Well, he's agreed to come back on with us.
[03:33:24.167 --> 03:33:26.249]  There is a lot more to this.
[03:33:26.249 --> 03:33:27.309]  Incredible story.
[03:33:27.309 --> 03:33:30.911]  I'm going to try to get his wife on in the next few days with him.
[03:33:30.911 --> 03:33:33.193]  But regardless, this is breaking now.
[03:33:33.193 --> 03:33:36.014]  We need to make sure the real issues get investigated.
[03:33:36.014 --> 03:33:38.095]  Kurt Haskell, we appreciate your courage.
[03:33:38.095 --> 03:33:39.716]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[03:33:39.716 --> 03:33:40.437]  Hey, no problem.
[03:33:40.437 --> 03:33:48.621]  And I just wanted to let you know that if there's any interest of me coming on again to do a Q&A session or tell anything further, I'd be glad to do it at any time.
[03:33:48.621 --> 03:33:50.603]  I just have very limited time today.
[03:33:51.946 --> 03:33:55.128]  I can't do it today, but I know I might be more than willing.
[03:33:55.128 --> 03:33:56.629]  Thank you so much, Mr. Haskell.
[03:33:56.629 --> 03:33:57.269]  Take care.
[03:33:57.269 --> 03:33:57.729]  No problem.
[03:33:57.729 --> 03:33:58.310]  Have a good day.
[03:33:58.310 --> 03:33:59.010]  Thank you.
[03:33:59.010 --> 03:34:00.811]  Goodbye.
[03:34:00.811 --> 03:34:01.871]  Oh, man.
[03:34:01.871 --> 03:34:02.932]  Oh.
[03:34:02.932 --> 03:34:05.173]  Oh.
[03:34:05.173 --> 03:34:09.075]  Well, I tell you, talking to him off-air, whoo!
[03:34:09.075 --> 03:34:12.497]  This is really bad.
[03:34:12.497 --> 03:34:20.421]  Meanwhile, the neocons, like Michael Shermer, the Skeptics Magazine, their god, is going, oh, we need to rescind our 9-11 truth.
[03:34:23.780 --> 03:34:26.282]  It's been proven Al-Qaeda exists.
[03:34:26.282 --> 03:34:33.226]  Of course there are Muslim extremists all over the place, but Al-Qaeda is a CIA computer program name from 1979.
[03:34:33.226 --> 03:34:40.030]  Zbigniew Brzezinski's written two books bragging about how he founded it.
[03:34:40.030 --> 03:34:47.375]  That's the reality.
[03:34:47.375 --> 03:34:50.217]  And no, this only proves we're right again.
[03:34:52.315 --> 03:34:56.096]  They got some guy they arrest with a bomb after the plane.
[03:34:56.096 --> 03:34:58.916]  The FBI's there trying to impeach his testimony.
[03:34:58.916 --> 03:35:08.918]  You got other witnesses from the same aircraft reporting that there's a guy filming the whole time.
[03:35:08.918 --> 03:35:14.399]  First reported by News Radio 620, WTJM.
[03:35:14.399 --> 03:35:18.459]  He sat up and videotaped the entire thing very calmly, said Patricia.
[03:35:18.459 --> 03:35:21.140]  We do know that the FBI is looking for him intensely.
[03:35:21.140 --> 03:35:21.560]  Yeah, right.
[03:35:23.732 --> 03:35:31.318]  Her daughter said ahead of them was a man who videotaped the entire flight, including the attempted detonation.
[03:35:31.318 --> 03:35:35.441]  Right as they're hyping wanting to go into Sudan.
[03:35:35.441 --> 03:35:38.443]  Right as they're hyping wanting to go into Yemen.
[03:35:38.443 --> 03:35:45.328]  Right as the news, both BBC and the New York Times,
[03:35:47.546 --> 03:35:53.448]  Reported the day before this happened that the new war was Yemen.
[03:35:53.448 --> 03:35:55.628]  Give me a close shot on this.
[03:35:55.628 --> 03:35:57.309]  Yemen, new frontier in U.S.
[03:35:57.309 --> 03:35:59.169]  war on terror, December 24th.
[03:35:59.169 --> 03:36:06.451]  That's BBC.
[03:36:06.451 --> 03:36:08.552]  Here's New York Times, December 24th.
[03:36:08.552 --> 03:36:11.873]  Hundreds of these articles in the last two weeks before this.
[03:36:11.873 --> 03:36:14.653]  Battle against al-Qaeda stepped up in Yemen.
[03:36:14.653 --> 03:36:15.494]  Thousands of U.S.
[03:36:15.494 --> 03:36:16.574]  special forces there.
[03:36:17.622 --> 03:36:24.864]  Full-scale deal going on.
[03:36:24.864 --> 03:36:30.586]  Now again, the FBI... You know what?
[03:36:30.586 --> 03:36:36.448]  I'm not going to say anything that Haskell told me that was off-air.
[03:36:36.448 --> 03:36:42.350]  Only two things he asked me not to talk about, and I'm not going to talk about those things he told me, but I'm not going to say anything else he told me.
[03:36:42.350 --> 03:36:43.150]  I'm just going to shut up,
[03:36:44.258 --> 03:36:46.019]  Till he's back on the show.
[03:36:46.019 --> 03:36:47.860]  That's the torture of this job, though, man.
[03:36:47.860 --> 03:36:57.226]  I mean, you get a high-level person over the Department of Cemeteries in New York State.
[03:36:57.226 --> 03:36:59.928]  That's a big department in any state.
[03:36:59.928 --> 03:37:13.556]  And they give you secret documents about how the government's getting ready for a mass flu die-off, and I get this three months before they start the flu hype, and I just say, I don't know if this is really going to happen, but the feds are telling
[03:37:14.793 --> 03:37:19.775]  The Bureau of Prisons in New York that there's going to be a massive flu in 2009, 2010.
[03:37:19.775 --> 03:37:21.956]  It's going to kill millions.
[03:37:21.956 --> 03:37:24.317]  Get ready for millions dead in New York.
[03:37:24.317 --> 03:37:32.720]  Then I get an emergency manager from Indiana bordering a Chicago county saying the same thing.
[03:37:32.720 --> 03:37:40.383]  And I've got to have one of the biggest eyewitnesses out there load all this info on me and I can't tell you about it.
[03:37:43.802 --> 03:37:47.224]  I've got an instant headache, just instant headache here.
[03:37:47.224 --> 03:37:49.346]  I'm literally doing hundreds of investigations at once.
[03:37:49.346 --> 03:37:51.767]  I'm not complaining.
[03:37:51.767 --> 03:38:02.034]  And then I gotta watch shniveling establishment people like this Michael Shermer, 9-11 truthers foiled by 1225 attack.
[03:38:02.034 --> 03:38:04.055]  We're foiled!
[03:38:04.055 --> 03:38:05.596]  Some simplistic thing about
[03:38:09.212 --> 03:38:17.159]  Because Al-Qaeda is releasing on Israeli fake intel sites responsibility.
[03:38:17.159 --> 03:38:29.611]  And Intel Center, run by the CIA publicly, puts out fake videos with their logo in the same layer as the grandson of the former head of the ADL, Adam Gadon.
[03:38:29.611 --> 03:38:33.675]  Israeli agents are the head of Al-Qaeda on TV?
[03:38:33.675 --> 03:38:34.856]  The public doesn't know that!
[03:38:36.274 --> 03:38:43.077]  They can verify that in five minutes, they don't want to know the truth.
[03:38:43.077 --> 03:38:52.380]  That is certain pockets of the population.
[03:38:52.380 --> 03:38:58.742]  Oh look, somebody on a message board calling themselves Al Qaeda took credit for this.
[03:38:58.742 --> 03:39:00.003]  And I'm sure the FBI will.
[03:39:01.803 --> 03:39:03.986]  Find some idiots who will carry out terror attacks.
[03:39:03.986 --> 03:39:06.769]  Should we give up all our rights, all our liberties?
[03:39:06.769 --> 03:39:08.812]  I mean, have you read the Homeland Security documents?
[03:39:08.812 --> 03:39:10.654]  Have you read the MIAC documents?
[03:39:10.654 --> 03:39:13.898]  The whole Homeland Security system is for Americans.
[03:39:13.898 --> 03:39:19.726]  Conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans, gun owners, and true anti-war liberals.
[03:39:21.451 --> 03:39:21.931]  I.e.
[03:39:21.931 --> 03:39:24.233]  any independent American.
[03:39:24.233 --> 03:39:26.514]  The whole system's for you.
[03:39:26.514 --> 03:39:29.256]  It surveils you.
[03:39:29.256 --> 03:39:36.821]  It has nothing to do with little brown people.
[03:39:36.821 --> 03:39:39.262]  Do you got that?
[03:39:39.262 --> 03:39:45.206]  The New World Order is worried about the last country they haven't disarmed that they haven't fully bankrupted and run yet.
[03:39:45.206 --> 03:39:47.247]  They've taken over everywhere else.
[03:39:47.247 --> 03:39:48.328]  They want the U.S.
[03:39:49.403 --> 03:39:52.045]  The big fat engine of tyranny.
[03:39:52.045 --> 03:40:02.574]  Under full control!
[03:40:02.574 --> 03:40:05.056]  Continuing here.
[03:40:05.056 --> 03:40:05.737]  Here's time.
[03:40:05.737 --> 03:40:07.678]  Yemen, Al Qaeda's new training ground.
[03:40:07.678 --> 03:40:08.579]  Oh my gosh.
[03:40:08.579 --> 03:40:10.180]  We've got to attack them.
[03:40:10.180 --> 03:40:11.601]  Everything's a hoax.
[03:40:11.601 --> 03:40:12.922]  It's like the health care bill.
[03:40:12.922 --> 03:40:14.544]  Now the Democrats have actually read it.
[03:40:14.544 --> 03:40:17.486]  It cuts everybody's health care and increases taxes.
[03:40:17.486 --> 03:40:18.067]  Gotta pass.
[03:40:19.246 --> 03:40:26.737]  The banker bailout, unlimited trillions, secretly going to banks, not to get the economy going, no one gets in trouble.
[03:40:26.737 --> 03:40:27.678]  Everything's fake.
[03:40:27.678 --> 03:40:28.860]  Everything's a hoax.
[03:40:28.860 --> 03:40:30.041]  Everything's a fraud.
[03:40:30.041 --> 03:40:35.108]  We have a criminal government that's committed so many crimes, why shouldn't they commit a million more?
[03:40:37.062 --> 03:40:39.964]  You've got this guy on a terror watch list allowed on.
[03:40:39.964 --> 03:40:41.986]  You've got the FBI protecting this guy.
[03:40:41.986 --> 03:40:45.868]  You've got the guy's dad going and saying, my son's hooked up with something bad.
[03:40:45.868 --> 03:40:54.355]  You've got this guy living in million-dollar apartments, and he shows up disheveled with some handler.
[03:40:54.355 --> 03:40:57.037]  Witnesses say he looked like he was drugged out of his mind.
[03:40:57.037 --> 03:41:04.182]  Here's some other witnesses from the airplane on the same show that Mr. and Mrs. Haskell were on, talking about the guy filming the entire flight.
[03:41:05.759 --> 03:41:07.184]  The government doesn't want to talk to them.
[03:41:07.184 --> 03:41:10.416]  You got that queued up?
[03:41:10.416 --> 03:41:10.777]  Here it is.
[03:41:14.246 --> 03:41:16.208]  Yeah, that was very strange.
[03:41:16.208 --> 03:41:23.095]  There was a man that when we first took off I noticed about 10 seats ahead of us to the left hand side.
[03:41:23.095 --> 03:41:26.339]  He had a camcorder and I didn't think much of it.
[03:41:26.339 --> 03:41:36.690]  I thought maybe this was his first flight and was just excited and then when the actual incident occurred I looked up and he was the only one standing and filming the entire thing.
[03:41:38.888 --> 03:41:41.169]  Interesting, there's obviously still so much more to come out about this.
[03:41:41.169 --> 03:41:44.211]  We really appreciate you joining us, Kurt and Lori Haskell.
[03:41:44.211 --> 03:41:52.156]  And in her, in her full testimony, that's another witness on with the Haskells, that's not the Haskells.
[03:41:52.156 --> 03:41:58.840]  In fact, I want to get her on if we can, for the feds to tell them to shut up.
[03:41:58.840 --> 03:42:01.122]  In the full interviews they've given on radio stations,
[03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:10.532]  Like the radio station source I mentioned earlier, let me be exact about that, 620.
[03:42:10.532 --> 03:42:12.073]  She said, yeah, the whole flight he was taping.
[03:42:12.073 --> 03:42:15.234]  We kept wondering why.
[03:42:15.234 --> 03:42:17.115]  Why aren't you seeing that video on the news?
[03:42:17.115 --> 03:42:21.817]  You're seeing a cop photo after the cops came on when the plane landed.
[03:42:21.817 --> 03:42:24.478]  Everybody's saying, well, that must be the footage with the police arresting him.
[03:42:24.478 --> 03:42:30.980]  No, there weren't a bunch of uniformed Detroit airport police on the plane.
[03:42:30.980 --> 03:42:33.281]  The citizens got him, tied him up,
[03:42:34.807 --> 03:42:40.609]  Strip-searched him to make sure he didn't have any more bombs.
[03:42:40.609 --> 03:42:43.150]  And that's a police photo.
[03:42:43.150 --> 03:42:46.372]  Why aren't the police releasing the footage?
[03:42:46.372 --> 03:42:50.293]  Because they haven't computer-morphed it yet.
[03:42:50.293 --> 03:42:54.155]  Why haven't they released the footage of the smart-dressed man at all those airport
[03:42:54.946 --> 03:42:56.948]  Video cameras from Amsterdam.
[03:42:56.948 --> 03:43:01.092]  Why haven't they released the footage from the man on the flight?
[03:43:01.092 --> 03:43:04.014]  Or if they don't have it, why didn't the man on the flight give it to him?
[03:43:04.014 --> 03:43:07.137]  Was he the handler of this guy?
[03:43:07.137 --> 03:43:09.119]  Don't worry.
[03:43:09.119 --> 03:43:10.660]  Don't worry, underwear bomber.
[03:43:10.660 --> 03:43:11.941]  I will be here videotaping.
[03:43:11.941 --> 03:43:13.483]  Security brought you on.
[03:43:13.483 --> 03:43:14.323]  You go ahead.
[03:43:14.323 --> 03:43:15.484]  You're doing this.
[03:43:15.484 --> 03:43:18.187]  You're going to be a full agent once you've carried out this drill.
[03:43:20.165 --> 03:43:21.305]  Continue with the drill?
[03:43:21.305 --> 03:43:24.007]  When they come on, you tell them it's part of a drill.
[03:43:24.007 --> 03:43:25.647]  This is how they do it.
[03:43:25.647 --> 03:43:36.252]  And for any of you fools working for the government, if they ever want you to do something you think is illegal during a drill, this is how they do it.
[03:43:36.252 --> 03:43:39.233]  This is how they set people up.
[03:43:39.233 --> 03:43:40.453]  This is how they operate.
[03:43:40.453 --> 03:43:43.995]  This is what they do over and over and over and over again.
[03:43:47.369 --> 03:43:54.273]  Meanwhile, we're not even talking about government takeover of healthcare.
[03:43:54.273 --> 03:43:55.794]  One-fifth of the U.S.
[03:43:55.794 --> 03:43:58.095]  economy.
[03:43:58.095 --> 03:44:01.638]  One-sixth, depending on how you slice it.
[03:44:01.638 --> 03:44:03.359]  What's left of the economy.
[03:44:03.359 --> 03:44:05.180]  Openly written by the insurance companies.
[03:44:05.180 --> 03:44:08.122]  Openly a scam.
[03:44:08.122 --> 03:44:12.324]  On record!
[03:44:12.324 --> 03:44:15.166]  Maybe Skeptics Magazine will write an article about how I'm imagining that.
[03:44:16.035 --> 03:44:20.756]  Maybe it doesn't have $41 million cut for Medicare and Medicaid, even though the bill says it.
[03:44:20.756 --> 03:44:23.217]  We'll just have someone say, oh, everything's fine.
[03:44:23.217 --> 03:44:24.057]  I'm an expert.
[03:44:24.057 --> 03:44:25.498]  I'm the anointed one.
[03:44:25.498 --> 03:44:27.578]  I say none of it's real.
[03:44:27.578 --> 03:44:30.879]  I say you can trust the government and the media.
[03:44:30.879 --> 03:44:35.661]  I say anyone that says government's too big or out of control, they're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:44:35.661 --> 03:44:39.602]  You can now be lazy and go back to sleep.
[03:44:39.602 --> 03:44:40.462]  Let's go to Wayne.
[03:44:43.567 --> 03:44:44.908]  Or WAV.
[03:44:44.908 --> 03:44:47.048]  I gotta get this monitor closer to me.
[03:44:47.048 --> 03:44:48.349]  WAVE in Connecticut.
[03:44:48.349 --> 03:44:48.929]  You're on the air.
[03:44:48.929 --> 03:44:50.230]  Go ahead.
[03:44:50.230 --> 03:44:51.030]  Wave bye.
[03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.750]  Wave hi.
[03:44:51.750 --> 03:44:56.392]  Anyway, yeah, I just started listening to you about four months ago.
[03:44:56.392 --> 03:45:00.333]  And I just wanted to tell you, Alex, don't be frustrated by these naysayers.
[03:45:00.333 --> 03:45:02.054]  I mean, you're doing a good thing.
[03:45:02.054 --> 03:45:09.117]  And I just wanted to tell you, my sister-in-law, who is my brother's second wife, doesn't know me very well.
[03:45:09.117 --> 03:45:11.177]  But she said, who is this Alex Jones?
[03:45:11.177 --> 03:45:12.578]  So I played her a clip of you at the
[03:45:13.462 --> 03:45:13.962]  Good job!
[03:45:13.962 --> 03:45:14.583]  Absolutely!
[03:45:14.583 --> 03:45:17.564]  And look, look, if you hadn't been there doing what you're doing, Wave,
[03:45:43.018 --> 03:45:44.258]  We'd be in a lot worse trouble.
[03:45:44.258 --> 03:45:49.140]  Do you have any comments about all the news here or how CNN has a fake poll?
[03:45:49.140 --> 03:45:53.041]  Oh, 73% are ready for the full body scan.
[03:45:53.041 --> 03:45:54.261]  Show them the quick vote.
[03:45:54.261 --> 03:45:55.161]  Quick vote!
[03:45:55.161 --> 03:45:56.882]  Which means they can fix the quick vote.
[03:45:56.882 --> 03:45:59.563]  Would you be willing to undergo an airport full body scan?
[03:45:59.563 --> 03:46:03.244]  The vast majority of Americans in polls I've seen were against these.
[03:46:03.244 --> 03:46:04.704]  Now they love them.
[03:46:04.704 --> 03:46:08.365]  Save me from the Nigerian underwear bomber!
[03:46:08.365 --> 03:46:09.505]  Help me!
[03:46:09.505 --> 03:46:10.726]  Wave, I appreciate your call.
[03:46:10.726 --> 03:46:12.046]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:46:14.175 --> 03:46:14.715]  Hello, Alex.
[03:46:14.715 --> 03:46:15.956]  How are you, sir?
[03:46:15.956 --> 03:46:19.638]  Well, I'm just scared to death of a Nigerian firecracker bomber!
[03:46:19.638 --> 03:46:25.222]  I better give up all my rights to foreign banks and have secret police violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution!
[03:46:25.222 --> 03:46:27.123]  The government's gonna save me!
[03:46:27.123 --> 03:46:28.744]  That's how I'm doing, Joe!
[03:46:28.744 --> 03:46:30.465]  Thank God for the bankers!
[03:46:30.465 --> 03:46:32.947]  Thank God they used that TARP money to rob us!
[03:46:32.947 --> 03:46:34.888]  Oh, thank you!
[03:46:34.888 --> 03:46:40.972]  Alex, I just had to appreciate you, and I just had two questions, and
[03:46:41.602 --> 03:46:52.267]  One was directed towards when you had Mr. Lenton regarding, do you think that they're going to try to slip some cap and trade into this health bill?
[03:46:52.267 --> 03:47:05.494]  And the second one was regarding Mr. Haskell, and you brought up a key point about the airport in Amsterdam, just how many people of Indian descent or African descent
[03:47:06.455 --> 03:47:11.400]  Uh, we're in that airport and or on that plane with Mr. and Ms.
[03:47:11.400 --> 03:47:12.622]  Haskell.
[03:47:12.622 --> 03:47:18.367]  And, uh, I'm just listening to your comments and I appreciate you and I'm getting your DVDs out as fast as I can.
[03:47:18.367 --> 03:47:19.048]  God bless you.
[03:47:19.048 --> 03:47:20.029]  Don't stop.
[03:47:20.029 --> 03:47:25.935]  The power of you, the listeners, getting the Obama Deception in game, fall of the Republic and giving it to people.
[03:47:25.935 --> 03:47:27.957]  The public is now ready to wake up.
[03:47:29.008 --> 03:47:32.370]  We've done incredible work together previously.
[03:47:32.370 --> 03:47:34.872]  Now is the season.
[03:47:34.872 --> 03:47:37.634]  Now is when the mighty crops are coming in.
[03:47:37.634 --> 03:47:43.437]  Every time we throw our nets in, the ships almost sink and there's so many fish in the nets.
[03:47:43.437 --> 03:47:45.899]  People are like, oh, they're announcing world government.
[03:47:45.899 --> 03:47:47.020]  There's nothing we can do.
[03:47:47.020 --> 03:47:48.801]  Baloney!
[03:47:48.801 --> 03:47:50.562]  Now the enemies come out in the open.
[03:47:52.273 --> 03:47:56.718]  I would guess there's a lot of Africans, a lot of Arabs coming through Amsterdam.
[03:47:56.718 --> 03:48:00.943]  That's a major African Middle Eastern hub into Europe and the rest of the world.
[03:48:02.773 --> 03:48:06.197]  There's a billion Indians, they're everywhere, so I don't know.
[03:48:06.197 --> 03:48:16.468]  But the bigger question is, why aren't we seeing the video from the plane and in the concourse and in the airport out?
[03:48:16.468 --> 03:48:22.755]  And what they'll do, what I predict in the next few weeks, if we make a big enough stink, if not it'll be six months from now, they'll release some side shot.
[03:48:24.814 --> 03:48:28.257]  Of hundreds of cameras and say, oh, we only caught it from the back.
[03:48:28.257 --> 03:48:29.498]  We don't know who he was.
[03:48:29.498 --> 03:48:33.361]  It'll just be on some side show right now that it's the big announcement.
[03:48:33.361 --> 03:48:41.348]  It's all about attacking Yemen and all about body scanning you and checkpoints on highways and roads and how the feds have to take over.
[03:48:41.348 --> 03:48:47.273]  And it's their big announcement and Obama's notified another Nigerian went potty for 19 minutes.
[03:48:48.374 --> 03:48:50.655]  And, oh, the President's scared on the phone.
[03:48:50.655 --> 03:48:51.996]  He was in the potty.
[03:48:51.996 --> 03:48:53.537]  Another one?
[03:48:53.537 --> 03:48:55.078]  I'll save the people.
[03:48:55.078 --> 03:48:56.278]  I'll take their rights.
[03:48:56.278 --> 03:48:57.659]  Oh, thank you, Obama.
[03:48:57.659 --> 03:49:04.242]  Right now it's about a smoke screen to cover up the passage of health care coming up next week.
[03:49:04.242 --> 03:49:06.143]  So people don't look what's in the bill.
[03:49:06.143 --> 03:49:07.684]  Or the Democrat revolt.
[03:49:07.684 --> 03:49:10.806]  Or, what, two Democrats stepping down, leaving their parties?
[03:49:12.734 --> 03:49:16.737]  And total revolt from the left against the healthcare bill because they found out?
[03:49:16.737 --> 03:49:18.058]  It's not a goody!
[03:49:18.058 --> 03:49:22.621]  You think the bankers are going to rob other people to give you something free?
[03:49:22.621 --> 03:49:28.526]  If they're going to rob people with your immoral wealth redistribution, they're going to keep it for them!
[03:49:28.526 --> 03:49:30.427]  Because who took over America?
[03:49:30.427 --> 03:49:31.948]  Who set up the police state?
[03:49:31.948 --> 03:49:32.809]  They did!
[03:49:32.809 --> 03:49:35.571]  You don't get nothing!
[03:49:35.571 --> 03:49:37.493]  Oh, you thought you were going to get a little bit of the honey!
[03:49:39.249 --> 03:49:39.849]  No, no, no.
[03:49:39.849 --> 03:49:42.651]  That domestication process is over.
[03:49:42.651 --> 03:49:44.552]  They've broken up the American family.
[03:49:44.552 --> 03:49:46.053]  They've screwed up the country.
[03:49:46.053 --> 03:49:47.854]  They've gotten enough people dependent.
[03:49:47.854 --> 03:49:55.779]  You're gonna get just enough chicken feed, enough hog feed to serve your masters, and nothing more.
[03:49:55.779 --> 03:49:58.841]  And you're gonna get your rations cut!
[03:49:58.841 --> 03:50:02.683]  Because now is the time of bondage.
[03:50:02.683 --> 03:50:06.085]  So you thought you were gonna get a little bit of goody there on the side.
[03:50:06.085 --> 03:50:07.166]  You're getting nothing.
[03:50:07.858 --> 03:50:12.480]  You're gonna get less of what you were getting and you're gonna like it!
[03:50:12.480 --> 03:50:17.383]  And the bankers are gonna take everybody's pension funds and just incrementally rape everyone.
[03:50:17.383 --> 03:50:19.444]  And you try to go out and protest?
[03:50:19.444 --> 03:50:27.768]  The cops will come right up, throw a rocket themselves, and then open fire with rubber bullets and sound cannons on you and run up with billy clubs and just...
[03:50:29.767 --> 03:50:32.769]  Right into old ladies' heads, watching teeth and blood spew.
[03:50:32.769 --> 03:50:36.852]  They'll high-five the death of America.
[03:50:36.852 --> 03:50:45.298]  And they'll drink their fluoride and give their babies all the aspartame and shots and their kids will have convulsions and the cops will go, God, I love government!
[03:50:45.298 --> 03:50:47.360]  I love how they hurt me too!
[03:50:47.360 --> 03:50:50.662]  As long as I can beat up old ladies, I feel good!
[03:50:50.662 --> 03:50:52.444]  Poison me, New World Order!
[03:50:52.444 --> 03:50:53.304]  I love you!
[03:50:54.205 --> 03:50:54.865]  Thank you!
[03:50:54.865 --> 03:51:02.847]  I'm a low-level psychopath who loves the bigger psychopaths!
[03:51:02.847 --> 03:51:04.867]  Remain in your houses.
[03:51:04.867 --> 03:51:10.628]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:51:10.628 --> 03:51:11.988]  Will they do it?
[03:51:11.988 --> 03:51:14.609]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:51:14.609 --> 03:51:21.070]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:51:21.070 --> 03:51:22.330]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:51:23.250 --> 03:51:27.535]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:51:27.535 --> 03:51:32.420]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:51:32.420 --> 03:51:37.345]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:51:37.345 --> 03:51:42.169]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:51:43.070 --> 03:51:51.494]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:51.494 --> 03:51:53.995]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:53.995 --> 03:51:57.057]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:51:57.057 --> 03:52:02.399]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:52:02.399 --> 03:52:06.421]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.421 --> 03:52:09.662]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:09.662 --> 03:52:11.063]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:11.984 --> 03:52:14.446]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.446 --> 03:52:20.832]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:20.832 --> 03:52:26.036]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.036 --> 03:52:36.024]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.144 --> 03:52:38.485]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:38.485 --> 03:52:40.065]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.065 --> 03:52:42.526]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:42.526 --> 03:52:44.667]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:44.667 --> 03:52:49.808]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:54:02.564 --> 03:54:15.512]  Well, obviously that was some breaking bombshell news from one of the key eyewitnesses
[03:54:17.287 --> 03:54:21.931]  Of how they let them take their own baggage off to get their operatives off in case something went bad.
[03:54:21.931 --> 03:54:23.612]  How they found somebody else with a bomb.
[03:54:23.612 --> 03:54:27.896]  That was them taking one of their agents out who got caught up in the search.
[03:54:27.896 --> 03:54:29.677]  If it fits, classic MO.
[03:54:29.677 --> 03:54:32.539]  You know, with a shoe bomber and everybody else, security leads them on.
[03:54:32.539 --> 03:54:33.800]  Oh, this is a special person.
[03:54:33.800 --> 03:54:36.463]  It's always some drugged-out freak all wild.
[03:54:36.463 --> 03:54:40.366]  That's why they've got to be led on, because they're always drugged out or mentally ill.
[03:54:40.366 --> 03:54:44.809]  Literally just, ugh, ugh, ugh, you know, being brought onto the plane.
[03:54:44.809 --> 03:54:46.671]  These patsies, man, never end.
[03:54:48.629 --> 03:54:50.150]  Pull up the shoe bomber's image.
[03:54:50.150 --> 03:54:55.153]  I mean, just out of his gourd, couldn't keep a job, couldn't tie his shoelaces.
[03:54:55.153 --> 03:54:59.956]  But he's the ace deadly Al-Qaeda, the reason freedom had to end in the world.
[03:54:59.956 --> 03:55:06.239]  Don't worry, black ski mask anti-terror cop is here to take your farm and ranch and your children.
[03:55:06.239 --> 03:55:10.902]  Oh, sorry, there's no Al-Qaeda, but there is American gun owner.
[03:55:10.902 --> 03:55:12.503]  I mean, look at that moron.
[03:55:12.503 --> 03:55:15.485]  That guy's got about five brain cells he can rub together if he's lucky.
[03:55:17.799 --> 03:55:21.680]  I mean, I've seen cockroaches with more intelligence in their eyes.
[03:55:21.680 --> 03:55:27.062]  It's a little bit like Sylvester Stallone on the lobotomy.
[03:55:27.062 --> 03:55:29.283]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55:29.283 --> 03:55:31.623]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[03:55:31.623 --> 03:55:34.264]  Geraldo Salente is coming up in the retransmission.
[03:55:34.264 --> 03:55:35.645]  I'm out of time for all these callers.
[03:55:35.645 --> 03:55:37.545]  I'm going to try to have more open phones the next few days.
[03:55:37.545 --> 03:55:38.486]  I've got a bunch of other guests.
[03:55:38.486 --> 03:55:39.606]  We'll continue to track all this.
[03:55:40.493 --> 03:55:40.994]  I don't know.
[03:56:01.598 --> 03:56:04.999]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[03:56:04.999 --> 03:56:07.500]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com.
[03:56:07.500 --> 03:56:07.860]  One word.
[03:56:07.860 --> 03:56:12.862]  Because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[03:56:12.862 --> 03:56:14.663]  This is a great little unit.
[03:56:14.663 --> 03:56:17.604]  Plug and play solar generators are now available from Solutions from Science.
[03:56:18.545 --> 03:56:21.329]  I've been available for two years and our listeners have told us they're good.
[03:56:21.329 --> 03:56:30.363]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current whenever and wherever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun, storing it in the battery system.
[03:56:30.363 --> 03:56:33.567]  Unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly and emits no fumes.
[03:56:34.923 --> 03:56:40.928]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power allergies again.

[03:56:54.118 --> 03:56:57.681]  And one other great sponsor is Diginet Personal Audio Video Recorders.
[03:56:57.681 --> 03:57:01.204]  They got hidden pins, they got sunglasses all in one piece.
[03:57:01.204 --> 03:57:03.045]  You talk about a great hidden system.
[03:57:03.976 --> 03:57:06.838]  To protect yourself from Big Brother or expose corruption.
[03:57:06.838 --> 03:57:13.842]  Everyone needs the systems they have at Diginet.net and they've got the best prices I've seen as one of the biggest dealers out there and they're patriots.
[03:57:13.842 --> 03:57:15.143]  Diginet.net.
[03:57:15.143 --> 03:57:19.426]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[03:57:19.426 --> 03:57:22.527]  And this unit is a video and recording device.
[03:57:22.527 --> 03:57:26.110]  That's their pin, disguised as a pin, and it fits right into your pocket.
[03:57:26.110 --> 03:57:28.071]  Again, I like the sunglasses, everything else.
[03:57:28.071 --> 03:57:32.193]  That's Diginet.net or get their phone number off the website.
[03:57:32.193 --> 03:57:32.694]  Diginet.
[03:57:33.359 --> 03:57:34.451]  Dot.
[03:57:34.451 --> 03:57:34.674]  Net.
[03:57:36.289 --> 03:57:40.452]  And one last little sponsor, and I'll give you a heads up on what's coming up tomorrow.
[03:57:40.452 --> 03:57:43.995]  Did you know you can be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[03:57:43.995 --> 03:57:46.217]  Well, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[03:57:46.217 --> 03:57:51.000]  Our sponsor, Ecolablue, with the Ecolablue 28, will allow you to do just that.
[03:57:51.000 --> 03:57:54.943]  It's easy to use, and it will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[03:57:54.943 --> 03:58:04.931]  The water, once generated, passes through a seven-stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis, carbon filtration techniques, ensuring that you know exactly what you're drinking, no chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[03:58:04.931 --> 03:58:05.972]  They've got their new Ecolablue
[03:58:06.152 --> 03:58:06.672]  We're good to go.
[03:58:33.027 --> 03:58:37.270]  Uh, we've got, uh, for a full hour, uh, Wayne Madsen coming up.
[03:58:37.270 --> 03:58:38.430]  Big show tomorrow.
[03:58:38.430 --> 03:58:39.131]  Don't want to miss it.
[03:58:39.131 --> 03:58:42.793]  God bless you all.
[03:58:42.793 --> 03:58:51.058]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:51.058 --> 03:58:58.042]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:58:58.042 --> 03:58:59.323]  No, this isn't science fiction.
