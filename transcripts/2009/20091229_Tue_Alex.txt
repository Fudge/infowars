[00:00:02.697 --> 00:00:06.879]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:08.339]  You want answers?
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.060]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.362]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:18.904]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:25.084]  And live from New York State, Gerald Cilente.
[00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:30.768]  We're simulcasting the radio show now in the last two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:31.609]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:37.073]  We're going to get to your calls in this hour, your questions or comments for Gerald Cilente at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:40.596]  He can really comment on any issue.
[00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:43.158]  I want to get his future trends for the economy.
[00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:57.628]  Gold, what he sees future trends with the police state, with war, with provocateur events that he predicted in the last year, what he thinks about the underwear bomber, the fact that he was ushered on the plane.
[00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.873]  Someone was videotaping him the entire time he was on board the plane.
[00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:04.535]  He was on terror list but ordered to be let on.
[00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:06.397]  His parents warned the FBI.
[00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:12.119]  The fact that they're now saying they want to attack Yemen and in the months before massed U.S.
[00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.762]  troops in Yemen for a new war there, just like Afghanistan.
[00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:20.387]  We're going to talk to Gerald Salente about all of that today.
[00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:27.674]  Gerald, of course, really doesn't need much of an introduction, but he is the martial artist of trends forecasting.
[00:01:28.957 --> 00:01:36.263]  And the purpose of Trends Forecasting is to provide insights and directions and anticipation of what the future may bring, and to be prepared for the unexpected.
[00:01:37.143 --> 00:01:43.088]  And he, of course, is the founder of Trends Research Institute, one of the top trends researchers in the world.
[00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:45.150]  The website is TrendsResearch.com.
[00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.694]  And joining us from his offices in New York State is Gerald Cilente.
[00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:51.815]  Gerald, good to have you here with us.
[00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:54.197]  It's always great being on with you, Alex.
[00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.875]  Well, we're about to go to break in three minutes, but out of the gates, what do you think about the terror scare?
[00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.697]  Oh, we've all got to be body scanned.
[00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.459]  We've all got to be prisoners on the planes.
[00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.103]  We have to keep our hands in our laps, nothing in our laps, no electronics.
[00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:12.604]  The government's going to save us.
[00:02:14.244 --> 00:02:19.771]  Well, you know, as you know, we had predicted terror 2010 was going to be an increase.
[00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:31.145]  And as the economies continue to decline, they're going to look for more and more excuses to make the people fearful so that our minds go off the bad economy.
[00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:33.259]  And go on to terror.
[00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:39.261]  And government, of course, is going to pretend that they can save us and protect us.
[00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:41.262]  And of course, we all know better.
[00:02:41.803 --> 00:02:55.929]  So they're going to use any incident, be it false flag or real, to keep gaining more control, because as we can see what's going on here, is that Obama is out-bushing Bush.
[00:02:58.513 --> 00:02:59.253]  Absolutely.
[00:02:59.273 --> 00:03:00.674]  We got a few minutes before we got a break.
[00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:02.235]  How is he out-bushing Bush?
[00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:04.556]  Well, go to the Patriot Act.
[00:03:04.596 --> 00:03:06.157]  They're bringing it to new levels.
[00:03:06.637 --> 00:03:09.218]  They've increased the war into Pakistan.
[00:03:09.658 --> 00:03:15.661]  Even Bush was hesitant about sending in predator drones into a sovereign country.
[00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:20.443]  He's escalated the war into Afghanistan.
[00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:26.266]  And now, as most people don't know, and you reported about a couple of weeks ago,
[00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:39.611]  Under Obama's direction, they've been fighting the Yemen war alongside Saudi Arabia, providing them with intelligence, and ostensibly they've been providing air support and cruise missiles.
[00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:46.934]  So he's taking this global war on terror to really spreading it around the globe.
[00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:51.435]  You predicted two years ago on this show that they would be going into Africa in a big way.
[00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:52.516]  That's now happening.
[00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:56.966]  Yes, and it's very important to watch what's going on in Yemen.
[00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:59.588]  Yemen, of course, borders Saudi Arabia.
[00:04:00.128 --> 00:04:03.790]  The Saudis are in the middle of a fight there in a civil war.
[00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:08.593]  Over a hundred Saudi soldiers have been killed, many more captured.
[00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:18.740]  The point being, if there's a strike on a Saudi oil facility, which is a high probability as this Yemen war expands,
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.663]  All bets are off for the economy.
[00:04:21.964 --> 00:04:24.087]  We're going to get hit with an oil shock.
[00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:26.210]  Forget this false recovery.
[00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:28.674]  It'll go straight toward the Greatest Depression.
[00:04:29.397 --> 00:04:45.921]  Well, over a year ago here, back in October when they passed the Banker Takeover Bill, you and many other economists we had on said that it would be a sugar high, that real jobs would keep contracting, but big banks, insurance companies, they would announce big profits, which they did.
[00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:47.962]  But the real economy's imploding.
[00:04:48.002 --> 00:04:50.042]  Now they're admitting the sugar high's wearing off.
[00:04:50.502 --> 00:04:57.444]  We'll talk about what's happening with the economy and a lot more as we look at trends in the 2010 with the master of trends, Gerald Solente.
[00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:03.345]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:11.807]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:12.547 --> 00:05:16.588]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:17.168 --> 00:05:27.990]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:37.632]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:38.132 --> 00:05:43.173]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:43.554 --> 00:05:50.755]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:53.776]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:02.705]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:06.008]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:11.032]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:11.052 --> 00:06:17.278]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:19.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.500]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.941]  Bernanke?
[00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:21.621]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.962]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.224]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:39.113 --> 00:06:43.037]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:06:43.498 --> 00:06:46.041]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:55.511]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:00.790]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.154]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:06.515 --> 00:07:08.256]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:08.576 --> 00:07:13.380]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.521]  How much do you want?
[00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:15.502]  When do you want it?
[00:07:15.882 --> 00:07:17.484]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:17.764 --> 00:07:18.584]  When will you need it?
[00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:20.906]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:22.147]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:22.387 --> 00:07:23.729]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:24.269]  If there's a
[00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:26.270]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.971]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:32.332]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:32.732 --> 00:07:36.234]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:36.554 --> 00:07:37.554]  How much will you need?
[00:07:37.794 --> 00:07:38.395]  We don't know.
[00:07:38.695 --> 00:07:39.595]  How much do you want?
[00:07:39.795 --> 00:07:40.536]  All you can get.
[00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:41.116]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:44.578]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:44.858 --> 00:07:47.039]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:48.119]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.101]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.077 --> 00:08:32.030]  Well, the founder and head of the Trends Research Institute, Gerald Salente, joins us via video Skype in this multimedia cast, radio, TV, that we're transmitting today on the last shows of 2009, the 29th day on this Tuesday of December.
[00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:44.996]  Okay, Gerald Cilente, I want to pick your brain today about the economy, about other trends you see developing, but finishing up with the terror.
[00:08:46.457 --> 00:08:47.458]  What is your gut?
[00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:51.017]  Looking at the way they already had troops massed in Yemen.
[00:08:51.478 --> 00:08:52.758]  They were gearing up for this.
[00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:57.021]  They ushered him on without a passport or ID.
[00:08:57.561 --> 00:08:58.522]  Passed security.
[00:08:58.842 --> 00:09:01.303]  Someone was filming him the whole time he was on the plane.
[00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:02.744]  People thought that was strange.
[00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:04.385]  Looked like some type of drill.
[00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:06.626]  His father warned people.
[00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:10.309]  He was on the terror list, but that was ignored.
[00:09:11.864 --> 00:09:13.025]  On and on and on.
[00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:15.646]  And now, oh, we've all got to accept the body scanners.
[00:09:15.987 --> 00:09:18.448]  Oh, Obama's got to launch new wars.
[00:09:18.588 --> 00:09:23.591]  I mean, if this isn't staged, I tell you, this is the luckiest thing in history for Obama.
[00:09:24.943 --> 00:09:27.845]  Well, again, you know, I don't know.
[00:09:27.925 --> 00:09:30.406]  Because there's always the other side of the story.
[00:09:30.907 --> 00:09:34.229]  And that is the high level of incompetence from the government.
[00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:37.711]  Look who's the Homeland Security Director.
[00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.872]  Janet Napolitano.
[00:09:40.172 --> 00:09:41.513]  Are you kidding me or what?
[00:09:41.953 --> 00:09:43.954]  Homeland Security, of what?
[00:09:44.595 --> 00:09:46.076]  I mean, look at these people.
[00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:48.137]  You know who these people are, Alex?
[00:09:48.177 --> 00:10:02.604]  Remember in high school and college, the people that wanted to be the class president or the head of the student council, that thought they were smarter than everybody else, and they sucked up and glad-handed and brown-nosed and knew nothing?
[00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:04.084]  Well, here they are!
[00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:07.026]  They're telling all the rest of us how to think and how to act.
[00:10:07.546 --> 00:10:08.906]  You know, is it suspicious?
[00:10:08.966 --> 00:10:09.706]  Yes, it is.
[00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:12.187]  Is the government totally incompetent?
[00:10:12.627 --> 00:10:13.807]  Look at what they're doing.
[00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:16.048]  Katrina Quality Rescue Skills.
[00:10:16.368 --> 00:10:20.809]  They still have a hole in the ground where 9-11 happened at the World Trade Center.
[00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:22.969]  Look at the wars they're prosecuting.
[00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:26.490]  The military hasn't won a war since World War II.
[00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.571]  Oh, I forgot Grenada.
[00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:30.371]  They did a great job on that one.
[00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:33.712]  So, I mean, you're working with a bunch of incompetents as well.
[00:10:34.032 --> 00:10:35.993]  So, yeah, it looks staged also.
[00:10:36.293 --> 00:10:37.914]  There could be collusion.
[00:10:38.334 --> 00:10:43.236]  But, again, when you put the whole mix together, you know, it makes you wonder.
[00:10:43.417 --> 00:10:44.417]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:10:44.437 --> 00:10:53.201]  I mean, in every one of these shoe bombers, you name it, some special security person ushers them with fake IDs or no ID right up onto the plane.
[00:10:54.417 --> 00:11:02.301]  And then meanwhile, I've seen old people who look like they're on the edge of death with oxygen tanks, literally being screamed at by TSA.
[00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:12.187]  I mean, I won't fly through Houston, George W. Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush Airport, because they literally scream at you like animals, and they've got a bunch of...
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.882]  A bunch of people on power trips literally howling in there.
[00:11:16.962 --> 00:11:22.105]  I mean, it is otherworldly how screwed up things are.
[00:11:22.145 --> 00:11:25.447]  So I understand what you're talking about, about the ineptitude.
[00:11:25.487 --> 00:11:31.130]  This just fits so much of the past MO we've seen with staged events.
[00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.432]  And we know they stage things like Gulf of Tonkin and other events.
[00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:36.143]  Of course they have.
[00:11:36.183 --> 00:11:37.124]  Remember the Maine?
[00:11:37.144 --> 00:11:39.146]  Yeah, I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:11:39.606 --> 00:11:41.989]  And the other side of the story, too.
[00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:50.958]  Who really, do the legislators or the president or the cabinet, they don't care about stepped-up security, what we have to go through.
[00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:52.179]  I hate to fly.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.781]  I try to go nowhere anymore.
[00:11:54.142 --> 00:11:56.003]  Because they have their own private jets.
[00:11:56.864 --> 00:11:58.605]  Everything is paid for them.
[00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.487]  They go to another country.
[00:12:00.507 --> 00:12:07.011]  They have military attachés picking them up, carrying their luggage, boarding them on, and taking them where they have to go.
[00:12:07.411 --> 00:12:10.673]  So this is just another inconvenience, if you will.
[00:12:10.693 --> 00:12:11.074]  That's right.
[00:12:11.114 --> 00:12:17.598]  That's why our military is in 190-something countries, because they're butlers to all these corrupt people in Congress.
[00:12:17.618 --> 00:12:25.844]  I was talking to a European Union member of Parliament yesterday, and he pointed out that the European Union bureaucrats are exempt from EU taxes.
[00:12:25.884 --> 00:12:26.404]  Did you know that?
[00:12:27.087 --> 00:12:27.509]  No, I didn't.
[00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.494]  I didn't know that.
[00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:29.318]  That is incredible.
[00:12:30.538 --> 00:12:32.999]  Well the whole thing, the whole game is incredible.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:42.485]  So as we're looking at this terror strike, or the aborted one, we're looking for 9-11 magnitude terror strikes in 2010.
[00:12:43.506 --> 00:12:49.770]  And when it happens, just like now for example, has anybody asked if this guy, why he did it?
[00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.851]  What provoked him to it?
[00:12:52.491 --> 00:12:59.816]  Could it possibly be, other than they hate our freedom and liberty, could it possibly be that he's
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.162]  Maybe disgusted with American foreign policy.
[00:13:04.643 --> 00:13:20.453]  Could it possibly be the hundreds of thousands of people that have been killed in the decades-long war that America's been waging abroad in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and now in Pakistan?
[00:13:20.973 --> 00:13:22.454]  And here's what to worry about.
[00:13:23.194 --> 00:13:25.136]  Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan,
[00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:30.697]  There are 300,000 approximately Pakistanis living in the U.S.
[00:13:31.237 --> 00:13:47.420]  Now, let's just suppose for a moment that you had a family member in the Swat Valley, or South or North Waziristan, or wherever else, and they've been slaughtered either by a predatory, uh, a predator drone.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:55.542]  Of course, they only do surgical strikes on quote, suspected terrorists, but they happen to wipe out your family in the meantime.
[00:13:56.102 --> 00:14:13.629]  And the Afghan army, again instigated by the U.S., waging this massive war, where there were more refugees in South Waziristan, North Waziristan, and the Swat Valley, than since the Rwandan crisis in 1994.
[00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.631]  Do you think you'd want to seek revenge?
[00:14:18.051 --> 00:14:22.614]  Do you think you'd have to belong to an organization such as Al-Qaeda?
[00:14:23.054 --> 00:14:34.280]  Or you're plenty angry and now you have the means and the wherewithal of weapons of mass destruction to wreck the havoc that's been wrecked upon you.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.823]  To do unto others as they have been doing unto you and your family.
[00:14:41.263 --> 00:14:44.004]  This is why we're going to see Terror 2010
[00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:49.186]  And when it happens, it'll be the same old story.
[00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:51.387]  They hate our freedom and liberty.
[00:14:51.647 --> 00:14:52.607]  And one other thing.
[00:14:53.088 --> 00:14:54.228]  I love the line.
[00:14:54.288 --> 00:14:55.348]  It comes from Obama.
[00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:56.289]  It came from Bush.
[00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:57.449]  It came from Clinton.
[00:14:57.469 --> 00:14:58.489]  It comes from all of them.
[00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.090]  We're going to hunt down the terrorists.
[00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.972]  We're going to bring them back to swift justice, or words to that effect.
[00:15:06.452 --> 00:15:08.913]  Oh, and we're going to catch every terrorist around.
[00:15:08.933 --> 00:15:12.274]  There have been more Elvis sightings than Obama sightings.
[00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:22.138]  Well, expanding on that, if some of this terror occasionally is real, any resistance is dubbed terror.
[00:15:22.398 --> 00:15:25.861]  If you hold your arm up when a cop's billy clubbing you, it's now called terrorism.
[00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:32.327]  Or if they're about to throw you off the cliff and you try to hold on to the edge, it's nightly news, the greatest terror attack in history.
[00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:37.692]  I mean, our media is saying that if Iran is hit and fights back in any way, they're going to be nuked.
[00:15:38.092 --> 00:15:39.173]  It's a new form of warfare.
[00:15:39.493 --> 00:15:40.635]  We attack you first.
[00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:46.958]  And then if you defend yourself, we nuke you and cry on TV and scare our nation of ninnies.
[00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:53.042]  But look, the globalists know when they go in and stir up the Muslims that that's going to cause them to strike back.
[00:15:53.622 --> 00:15:55.043]  It's like going up and hitting a bee's nest.
[00:15:55.603 --> 00:15:55.904]  And then...
[00:15:56.983 --> 00:15:58.785]  They get to take the American people's freedom.
[00:15:59.106 --> 00:16:00.848]  So it's problem, reaction, solution.
[00:16:01.148 --> 00:16:03.291]  The elite didn't get in power over being bozos.
[00:16:03.752 --> 00:16:11.141]  And on top of it, if these Muslims really are just attacking us because they're mad, don't they know that when they attack, that makes our military come and invade?
[00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:13.124]  Don't they know that brings in the wrath?
[00:16:14.943 --> 00:16:16.123]  Well, yes, they do know.
[00:16:16.204 --> 00:16:27.368]  What's the reports going out now, however, that there's another report about Israel planning to do a, quote, surgical strike against the Iranian nuclear facility?
[00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:28.589]  That's the other big part.
[00:16:28.809 --> 00:16:29.169]  You're right.
[00:16:29.209 --> 00:16:38.313]  They're kicking all this off for the police state, getting ready to go into Iran because they know there'll be real terror attacks in this country if Iran is hit.
[00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:38.813]  Go ahead.
[00:16:39.892 --> 00:16:41.373]  I want to make this really clear.
[00:16:41.994 --> 00:16:48.459]  If anybody attacks Iran, the United States, or Israel, it's the beginning of World War III.
[00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:51.661]  These are the Persians, let anyone forget.
[00:16:52.201 --> 00:16:56.204]  There are 70 million of them and they're armed to the teeth.
[00:16:56.905 --> 00:16:59.187]  They fought Iraq for eight years.
[00:16:59.847 --> 00:17:04.751]  They didn't give up one inch of territory and lost over a million people.
[00:17:05.652 --> 00:17:08.374]  Anybody thinks that they're going to beat Iran
[00:17:09.514 --> 00:17:13.256]  Well, you know, they're part of the military-industrial complex.
[00:17:13.296 --> 00:17:14.837]  Maybe it's not beating them at all.
[00:17:15.278 --> 00:17:18.219]  Maybe it's just keep making money for prolonged war.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.263]  Because anybody in their right mind knows that they're not going to go down in any way.
[00:17:24.824 --> 00:17:26.224]  And this is also important.
[00:17:26.244 --> 00:17:29.386]  We keep hearing about, you know, the great Israeli military.
[00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:31.448]  Israel lost to Lebanon.
[00:17:32.188 --> 00:17:36.213]  They could bomb, like the United States, they could bomb any country into oblivion.
[00:17:36.553 --> 00:17:39.557]  But once you hit the ground, it's a different story.
[00:17:40.238 --> 00:17:45.724]  So, with Iran, nobody's going to be successful attacking Iran internally.
[00:17:45.744 --> 00:17:49.669]  They could bomb into oblivion, as I said, it's the beginning of World War III.
[00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:50.911]  There's no stopping it.
[00:17:51.391 --> 00:18:06.236]  So if Israel goes in, and again there's those sabers being rattled now in the news, if that happens, we're going to be in for a hellish time in 2010 and probably for the rest of our lives.
[00:18:08.766 --> 00:18:10.607]  Do you believe Israel's going to hit in 2010?
[00:18:10.948 --> 00:18:14.190]  I mean, they're openly making noises saying they may go ahead and strike.
[00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.972]  I don't believe so, and I could be wrong.
[00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:20.054]  I only say that because they've been saying this for a number of years.
[00:18:20.895 --> 00:18:25.938]  And I don't know if they're trial balloons to see what kind of response they'll get back from Washington.
[00:18:26.399 --> 00:18:30.182]  Because the latest, it's the same story, every administration, for example.
[00:18:31.042 --> 00:18:38.288]  Every administration tells Israel, no, you can't build any more housing developments on Palestinian land.
[00:18:38.328 --> 00:18:39.048]  You can't do it.
[00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.769]  Stop.
[00:18:39.829 --> 00:18:41.430]  It's against international law.
[00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:43.212]  And Israel does it anyway.
[00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:44.873]  And they're doing it again.
[00:18:45.233 --> 00:18:49.056]  There was just an announcement yesterday for 600 more apartment units.
[00:18:49.657 --> 00:18:51.258]  The administration says no.
[00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:51.678]  Stop.
[00:18:51.778 --> 00:18:52.839]  Israel says do it.
[00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:57.803]  So Israel could be testing the United States to see what their response is.
[00:18:58.343 --> 00:18:59.665]  But always remember,
[00:19:00.385 --> 00:19:08.654]  That the more this country is involved militarily at any level, the less freedoms that we the people have.
[00:19:09.434 --> 00:19:16.341]  The worst the economy gets, and we wrote about this over and over again, when this bailout bubble bursts,
[00:19:17.352 --> 00:19:22.616]  When all else fails, they have no more financial tricks to deal on the table.
[00:19:23.177 --> 00:19:25.219]  The next card they play is war.
[00:19:25.499 --> 00:19:26.980]  And that's what we're concerned about.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.602]  I've said it on your show.
[00:19:28.902 --> 00:19:30.663]  I've said it on CNBC.
[00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:32.345]  I say it everywhere.
[00:19:32.765 --> 00:19:40.772]  When all else fails, governments after governments take the people to war to get their minds off
[00:19:42.188 --> 00:19:43.148]  It's a smaller problem.
[00:19:43.569 --> 00:19:45.149]  All right, Gerald Cilente, stay there.
[00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:57.735]  I want to get directly into your trends forecast for 2010 and beyond on the economy, on civil unrest, on the police state, on the health care bill, on so much more with Gerald Cilente.
[00:19:57.755 --> 00:19:58.215]  Stay with us.
[00:19:58.255 --> 00:20:01.397]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:20:01.757 --> 00:20:03.598]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:20:04.058 --> 00:20:04.498]  Don't!
[00:20:04.918 --> 00:20:07.940]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:14.104]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:20:32.017 --> 00:20:32.997]  Herb K. was right.
[00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:36.279]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:20:36.399 --> 00:20:37.399]  What have you got to lose?
[00:20:37.739 --> 00:20:40.941]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:42.081]  Get Herb K.'
[00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:45.123]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:20:45.403 --> 00:20:45.803]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:20:45.983 --> 00:20:46.243]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:20:46.263 --> 00:20:46.303]  888-352-7726.
[00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:03.029]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:06.415]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:06.656 --> 00:21:08.079]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.441]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:11.461 --> 00:21:17.663]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:22.865]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:23.025 --> 00:21:33.009]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:33.129 --> 00:21:35.250]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.811]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:37.071 --> 00:21:39.352]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:41.373]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:41.653 --> 00:21:46.416]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:21:46.796 --> 00:21:55.920]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:58.726 --> 00:21:59.567]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:21:59.747 --> 00:22:05.090]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.691]  I get it.
[00:22:05.831 --> 00:22:15.157]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:15.437 --> 00:22:16.578]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:16.838 --> 00:22:25.105]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:25.325 --> 00:22:28.607]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:28.727 --> 00:22:32.811]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:32.991 --> 00:22:34.552]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:34.592 --> 00:22:37.815]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:37.995 --> 00:22:42.158]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:43.059]  You should, too.
[00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:44.220]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.283]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.
[00:22:47.443 --> 00:22:47.683]  Free.
[00:22:47.703 --> 00:22:47.743]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.763 --> 00:22:48.064]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.084 --> 00:22:48.284]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.304 --> 00:22:48.524]  Hello.
[00:22:48.604 --> 00:22:51.767]  At offthefield.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:22:51.847 --> 00:22:53.189]  We get lots of amazing positive
[00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:11.085]  I think.
[00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:37.245]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:23:37.365 --> 00:23:42.811]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:24:28.204 --> 00:24:36.210]  I want to remind listeners Gerald Cilente for more than two decades has been devastatingly accurate on his trends and forecasts.
[00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.072]  We're honored to have him here with us today.
[00:24:38.092 --> 00:24:44.156]  And of course when he's up on screen with us you can see the URL for his Trends Research Institute website.
[00:24:44.757 --> 00:24:45.618]  Gerald Cilente.
[00:24:46.929 --> 00:24:56.994]  Shifting gears now purely into the economy, and of course we know the staged terror and the new wars are about smokescreening that and getting us to rally around the New World Order flag.
[00:24:57.895 --> 00:25:01.657]  What else do you see economically coming up in 2010 into 2011?
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:06.680]  ...of 2010.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.801]  The markets collapsed in March 9, 2009.
[00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:26.806]  The only thing that's happened is the world governments, the central bankers, have flooded the world with money to keep propping up the failing banks and brokerage firms, to the tune of about $6 trillion, roughly.
[00:25:27.086 --> 00:25:30.607]  But let's look at the real numbers and let's look what's really going on.
[00:25:31.688 --> 00:25:32.108]  Iceland.
[00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:44.226]  Greece, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, US, UK.
[00:25:45.678 --> 00:25:52.263]  One after another, countries are going under, they're going bankrupt, and they're ready to fail.
[00:25:52.523 --> 00:26:03.031]  And meanwhile, our mainstream media is telling us everything's wonderful, while the big brokerage firms are quietly telling their wealthy investors, hey, you better get ready for a possible total collapse.
[00:26:03.071 --> 00:26:04.752]  Now, what are you saying in 2010?
[00:26:04.852 --> 00:26:06.454]  Because you actually said 2009.
[00:26:06.814 --> 00:26:08.755]  What are you saying?
[00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:10.056]  You're looking for another implosion?
[00:26:10.637 --> 00:26:14.420]  No, what I meant to say is in 2009, the markets collapsed.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:15.180]  Got it.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:15.420]  Got it.
[00:26:32.106 --> 00:26:32.887]  Oh, it's okay.
[00:26:32.927 --> 00:26:33.607]  Nothing's wrong.
[00:26:33.647 --> 00:26:34.408]  Nothing's wrong.
[00:26:34.728 --> 00:26:36.049]  That's what they try to tell us.
[00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.392]  That's the canary in the commercial real estate mindshare.
[00:26:41.013 --> 00:26:44.376]  We're going to start seeing more and more commercial failures.
[00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:47.538]  And they're going to dwarf the subprime problem.
[00:26:47.978 --> 00:26:51.141]  There's a story worth reading in today's New York Times.
[00:26:51.281 --> 00:26:54.043]  Actually, it's an op-ed piece from a previous story.
[00:26:54.723 --> 00:26:56.845]  It's about the Goldman Sachs gang.
[00:26:57.466 --> 00:27:00.528]  They have, you know, they always tell us what brilliant, the most
[00:27:00.728 --> 00:27:02.250]  Brilliant minds!
[00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:07.337]  We need to pay a lot of money to get the most brilliant minds in finance.
[00:27:07.697 --> 00:27:13.705]  Yeah, the most brilliant minds so they could pull off the most brilliant criminal schemes possible.
[00:27:14.146 --> 00:27:14.887]  Here's what they've done.
[00:27:16.032 --> 00:27:18.033]  You can't make this stuff up, but they did.
[00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:24.036]  They call it a Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation.
[00:27:24.736 --> 00:27:27.497]  A Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation?
[00:27:27.897 --> 00:27:28.718]  What does that mean?
[00:27:29.098 --> 00:27:35.421]  Oh, what it means is you invest with us, and you're going to be guaranteed to get great returns.
[00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:41.023]  So they sucker you in, the Goldman Sachs gang, for you to invest with them.
[00:27:41.063 --> 00:27:45.304]  And meanwhile, they're shorting the position, knowing that it's going to fail.
[00:27:45.604 --> 00:27:47.065]  It's in black and white.
[00:27:47.385 --> 00:27:51.486]  And again, you and many of other great guests we had said this a year ago.
[00:27:51.506 --> 00:27:58.969]  Now it's come out in the five-part Siri McClatchy newspapers that Goldman Sachs engineered this whole thing to destroy their competition.
[00:27:59.469 --> 00:28:04.471]  Internally, they were betting against housing while telling all their sucker customers to invest in it.
[00:28:05.168 --> 00:28:05.709]  That's right.
[00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:16.601]  It would be like you taking out an insurance policy with me, giving me the money, and then me killing you, and then collecting on the policy.
[00:28:17.021 --> 00:28:18.323]  That's what they're doing.
[00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:24.470]  That's what these great minds that we have to pay all this money to, to bail them out,
[00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:29.675]  And to keep them like we're doing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Christmas Eve.
[00:28:29.795 --> 00:28:32.898]  And of course, it's not really just a bailout.
[00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:34.480]  They made money on the way up.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.101]  This is just their profit on the way down.
[00:28:36.161 --> 00:28:36.501]  Go ahead.
[00:28:37.213 --> 00:28:40.176]  Well, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that they did on Christmas Eve.
[00:28:41.438 --> 00:28:47.365]  Now the government has guaranteed them unlimited funds to keep the housing scam going.
[00:28:47.385 --> 00:28:50.809]  You know, 9 out of 10 mortgages are backed by the government.
[00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:52.150]  And what did they do?
[00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:56.936]  They gave the CEOs of these companies, what, a $6 million salary?
[00:28:58.257 --> 00:29:02.778]  I mean, come on, but they do it on Christmas Eve when nobody's watching.
[00:29:03.259 --> 00:29:06.860]  So what we're looking for in 2010 is the collapse.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:16.322]  And by the way, when we're looking at the collapse of 2010, we're also looking at the possible breakup of the European Monetary Union.
[00:29:17.003 --> 00:29:20.884]  So, for example, I spoke about Greece and Portugal and Ireland and Spain.
[00:29:21.364 --> 00:29:24.945]  Greece, for example, their budget deficit is 13% greater
[00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:30.814]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:30.834 --> 00:29:33.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:57.657 --> 00:30:04.499]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:30:04.639 --> 00:30:05.879]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[00:30:57.429 --> 00:31:02.595]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:07.100]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.122]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:31:09.543 --> 00:31:10.904]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:31:11.165 --> 00:31:12.206]  There is a solution.

[00:31:57.332 --> 00:32:01.575]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:01.895 --> 00:32:02.496]  Number one.
[00:32:02.796 --> 00:32:05.958]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:06.218 --> 00:32:06.799]  Number two.
[00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:11.642]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:11.982 --> 00:32:12.422]  It's true.
[00:32:12.723 --> 00:32:17.266]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:17.586 --> 00:32:18.127]  Number 3.
[00:32:18.407 --> 00:32:21.689]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.732]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:25.913 --> 00:32:26.453]  Number 4.
[00:32:26.713 --> 00:32:29.075]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:29.475 --> 00:32:32.858]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:33.158 --> 00:32:33.358]  Number 5.
[00:32:33.939 --> 00:32:37.862]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:38.082 --> 00:32:42.846]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:43.126 --> 00:32:47.169]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:47.289 --> 00:32:48.870]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.192]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:51.352 --> 00:32:53.613]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:53.633 --> 00:32:54.414]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:33:18.035 --> 00:33:23.116]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, going back to Gerald Cemente here in just a moment.
[00:33:23.477 --> 00:33:29.219]  I want to remind you we have some of the best deals on books, videos, Patriot apparel.
[00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:32.080]  It's a great way to meet like-minded people out there.

[00:33:39.855 --> 00:33:41.437]  I want to thank all of you for your support.
[00:33:42.038 --> 00:33:44.100]  We have some deals running for just a few weeks more.
[00:33:44.161 --> 00:33:50.989]  The holiday specials from Christmas where you can get Fall of the Republic and a free Don't Tread on Me or Obama Joker t-shirt.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.904]  Have some other variants of those shirts up there on the site.
[00:33:55.364 --> 00:33:57.086]  You can still get five months free.
[00:33:57.446 --> 00:34:01.891]  We always do this in the month of December when signing up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:01.911 --> 00:34:08.439]  We can also watch the live slash TV show, 15 cents a day, or get five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:10.601 --> 00:34:16.363]  Also, some of the sponsors that make this radio show possible are the great folks at Ecuador Central.
[00:34:16.843 --> 00:34:21.465]  Ecuador Central believes we all have a duty to protect our families and our wealth.
[00:34:22.145 --> 00:34:25.486]  If you're considering a new life somewhere else or want a second home outside the U.S.
[00:34:25.566 --> 00:34:27.427]  or if you want an interest in a growing economy,
[00:34:29.252 --> 00:34:30.433]  EcuadorCentral.com
[00:34:57.739 --> 00:35:11.454]  Okay, going back to Gerald Salente of the TrendsResearch.com, the Trends Research Institute, and we are going over a bunch of different issues with him.
[00:35:11.494 --> 00:35:12.354]  He was talking about
[00:35:13.409 --> 00:35:14.890]  And again, I've got to hand it to Gerald.
[00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:19.813]  I remember him saying about six months ago, look at Europe perhaps breaking up.
[00:35:19.873 --> 00:35:20.994]  It's going to be so bad.
[00:35:21.034 --> 00:35:24.316]  And our government's going to have peaceful revolution.
[00:35:24.376 --> 00:35:27.478]  It's over for them by 2012.
[00:35:28.439 --> 00:35:30.620]  And then I started seeing mainstream news articles.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.721]  I saw one last week.
[00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:36.503]  Saying Greece and others may go under, may bring down the European Union.
[00:35:37.023 --> 00:35:39.824]  My issue is, the European Union wants them deep in debt.
[00:35:40.184 --> 00:35:41.545]  Wants them under those controls.
[00:35:41.605 --> 00:35:44.867]  So, I think they'll just refinance the deals with them.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:50.269]  But continuing Gerald Cilente with what you see happening on the economy, then domestically here.
[00:35:51.696 --> 00:35:57.340]  As the economy goes down, we're going to start seeing, of course, nothing goes straight down or up or down.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.182]  We're still very bullish on gold prices.
[00:36:00.242 --> 00:36:01.182]  We believe gold 2,000.
[00:36:02.823 --> 00:36:11.409]  What's happened is that as Greece and Eastern Europe has been going under, and of course, Sweden, Austria, the rest have been financing it,
[00:36:11.929 --> 00:36:16.814]  What they're doing is people are bailing out of the euro and then going into the dollar.
[00:36:16.834 --> 00:36:22.520]  Well, that's like jumping out of one sinking ship and then jumping into the other sinking ship.
[00:36:22.961 --> 00:36:28.026]  So, temporarily, we're going to have it look as though the dollar's rebounding.
[00:36:28.406 --> 00:36:32.030]  But this is very important in putting all the pieces together.
[00:36:32.751 --> 00:36:39.938]  With a high probability of when terrorist strikes in 2010, go back to what they did in 2001.
[00:36:40.358 --> 00:36:41.840]  They closed down Wall Street.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:54.251]  If you had certificates of deposit like I did, and tried to get them out of the bank like I did, they wouldn't give them to me because Wall Street was closed and they said CDs of financial instruments.
[00:36:55.052 --> 00:36:56.013]  Trade it on the street.
[00:36:56.514 --> 00:37:04.404]  Now, what they will do this time, because the economy is in much worse shape than back then, we believe they'll call a bank holiday.
[00:37:04.464 --> 00:37:05.525]  They'll close the banks.
[00:37:06.326 --> 00:37:10.671]  That also means that when they reopen, there's a very good probability
[00:37:11.232 --> 00:37:13.214]  That your money will be devalued.
[00:37:13.374 --> 00:37:32.188]  As you well know, Alex, what they did when FDR closed the banks, repatriated the gold, they made him sell it back to the government at $20, $67 an ounce, and then they re-pegged it, what was it, $35 an ounce, so you lost 40% of your value.
[00:37:32.528 --> 00:37:34.170]  Your money was devalued.
[00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.932]  That's the kind of thing we fear now.
[00:37:37.572 --> 00:37:39.334]  A financial crisis is looming.
[00:37:40.074 --> 00:37:41.634]  Terrorism is in the wings.
[00:37:42.235 --> 00:37:46.616]  When it happens, they will close down the financial system.
[00:37:47.316 --> 00:37:49.157]  ATMs will close down.
[00:37:49.517 --> 00:37:57.319]  You will only be able to get a certain amount of money back, like they did in Argentina and other failing countries.
[00:37:57.339 --> 00:38:02.700]  And when you get your money back, it'll be worth a fraction of what it used to be worth.
[00:38:03.201 --> 00:38:04.461]  That's what we're concerned about.
[00:38:05.555 --> 00:38:18.928]  And again, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, just to back you up, he said a month and a half ago, when gold was at an all-time high of $1,200-plus, he said, look for the carry trade that's been reversed.
[00:38:18.948 --> 00:38:21.110]  Before it went to Asia, now it goes to America.
[00:38:21.791 --> 00:38:24.173]  Look for that to unwind in the new year.
[00:38:25.154 --> 00:38:31.018]  In December into January, and for a few months the dollar's going to go up, then it's going to dive down again.
[00:38:31.038 --> 00:38:32.939]  And that is coming to pass.
[00:38:33.459 --> 00:38:35.060]  Is that basically what you're saying, Gerald?
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.881]  That's precisely it.
[00:38:37.582 --> 00:38:40.703]  And again, it's just a short-time readjustment.
[00:38:41.004 --> 00:38:46.627]  But the fact of the matter is, and this is the point, none of the currencies are worth the paper they're printed on.
[00:38:46.647 --> 00:38:49.649]  The European Central Banks have been flooding the...
[00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:54.113]  The marketplace with cheap money and now they're starting to repatriate it.
[00:38:54.373 --> 00:38:55.614]  Here's the way the deal works.
[00:38:56.355 --> 00:39:01.600]  A commercial bank goes to the central bank and they put up collateralized debt.
[00:39:02.881 --> 00:39:06.283]  And then the central bank's loan of money on the collateral that they gave them.
[00:39:06.963 --> 00:39:08.884]  The collateral isn't worth anything.
[00:39:09.244 --> 00:39:10.125]  It's junk.
[00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:12.366]  It's toxic assets.
[00:39:12.766 --> 00:39:14.647]  It's Dubai value.
[00:39:15.308 --> 00:39:23.152]  So now, when they start repatriating, there's nothing too good there to repatriate in terms of unwinding their positions.
[00:39:23.632 --> 00:39:28.255]  So the big collapse will happen, we believe, around springtime.
[00:39:28.855 --> 00:39:32.118]  It happened again with the dot-com crash around the same time.
[00:39:32.458 --> 00:39:35.841]  We're looking for around the same time of unwinding this spring.
[00:39:36.121 --> 00:39:40.244]  It can happen earlier because there are wildcars that no one can see.
[00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:44.567]  And the wildcard to keep watching is going to be Terra.
[00:39:45.048 --> 00:39:47.129]  Terra is back in style.
[00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:50.552]  Look for their orange alerts, the yellow alerts.
[00:39:50.872 --> 00:39:54.055]  Look for every kind of makeup alert that they could make up.
[00:39:54.495 --> 00:40:01.166]  And Napolitano will be out there, Homeland Security, saying that the situation is under control.
[00:40:01.527 --> 00:40:05.994]  I can't believe they came up with such an unbelievable character.
[00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:20.229]  That's right, and we also have all these different governments saying, 300 suicide bombers on planes, thousands of white Al-Qaeda, the militias have linked up with Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:20.629 --> 00:40:24.793]  Now that clearly is staged, and we got the MIAC and Homeland Security reports.
[00:40:25.874 --> 00:40:36.399]  That stated the real homeland security system is set up for veterans, gun owners, patriots, the American people revolting against Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan that have been robbing us.
[00:40:36.719 --> 00:40:38.020]  Can you speak to that?
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:46.563]  To them trying to use the terror card against the American people and to what you see on the revolt end that you said you've seen coming up in 2012?
[00:40:48.991 --> 00:40:53.334]  We see the revolt really gaining steam, because there's not going to be any recovery.
[00:40:53.754 --> 00:40:55.455]  Unemployment numbers are terrible.
[00:40:55.775 --> 00:40:57.296]  And we know they're fudging the numbers.
[00:40:57.316 --> 00:40:59.457]  And that's not... This isn't made up, by the way.
[00:40:59.517 --> 00:41:00.418]  Just look at the facts.
[00:41:01.038 --> 00:41:03.600]  The third quarter GDP reports, 2009.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:04.841]  It came in 3.5%.
[00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:09.103]  The stock market was, oh, jubilant.
[00:41:09.143 --> 00:41:11.104]  They just rose and kept going higher.
[00:41:11.585 --> 00:41:12.625]  Then they readjusted.
[00:41:12.665 --> 00:41:15.607]  Well, they readjusted it one more once, down to 2.2.
[00:41:17.228 --> 00:41:20.351]  As you well know, they're cooking the unemployment numbers as well.
[00:41:20.971 --> 00:41:26.736]  The real unemployment rate, with long-term unemployed, discouraged, part-time, we're looking at 20%.
[00:41:27.977 --> 00:41:37.946]  When winter sets in, remember, you're going to start seeing a big increase in unemployment as the temporary jobs that were created during the holidays start to disappear.
[00:41:38.306 --> 00:41:42.570]  And then look behind the numbers of what kind of jobs are being created.
[00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:45.522]  Hey, you want a job in home health care?
[00:41:45.863 --> 00:41:47.964]  How about a personal home and health aid?
[00:41:48.385 --> 00:41:51.967]  There's a job for $8.20 an hour waiting for you.
[00:41:52.488 --> 00:41:54.609]  Want to stock shelves at Walmart's?
[00:41:54.989 --> 00:41:57.311]  You have that four-year college degree.
[00:41:57.631 --> 00:41:58.792]  Let's put it to use.
[00:41:58.972 --> 00:42:01.794]  Well, they already reported this is the worst Christmas sale since 1979.
[00:42:05.063 --> 00:42:06.964]  Well again, this is what we're looking at.
[00:42:07.104 --> 00:42:13.646]  The jobs that are being created, even when they're pumping the numbers up, the jobs aren't worth anything.
[00:42:14.106 --> 00:42:17.087]  So we're going to... And then, oh by the way, this is another big one.
[00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:24.510]  All these kids with college degrees, that their parents said that it could be anything they wanted to be, they have nothing.
[00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.252]  They're going nowhere.
[00:42:26.632 --> 00:42:27.633]  It's a dead end.
[00:42:28.053 --> 00:42:35.180]  So now you're putting all this together, you're seeing the beginning of the Second American Revolution.
[00:42:35.561 --> 00:42:36.722]  It's underway.
[00:42:37.022 --> 00:42:44.029]  It happened with the Tea Parties, the tax protests, the Fourth of July demonstrations, the town hall meeting revolts.
[00:42:44.449 --> 00:42:54.820]  The people going to march on Washington, against big government, of course it's being hijacked by different elements out there, but nonetheless it's still moving forward.
[00:42:55.181 --> 00:43:01.547]  So as we're looking at the economy going down, we're looking at the revolution going up,
[00:43:02.268 --> 00:43:04.389]  And then we're looking at terrorism.
[00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:07.490]  The government knows they're losing control.
[00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:11.712]  When they lose control, they tighten the screws.
[00:43:12.232 --> 00:43:14.112]  And that's what we're going to see.
[00:43:14.513 --> 00:43:18.514]  The screws are going to be tightened in the name of terror.
[00:43:18.874 --> 00:43:20.155]  But how does that play out?
[00:43:21.476 --> 00:43:32.556]  Reading a trends forecaster, which I really respect, you're believing it's not going to work, it'll take a few years, but by them showing their hand, that this is the beginning of the end of this group of corporate criminals?
[00:43:33.857 --> 00:43:35.598]  That's the way we look at it now.
[00:43:35.798 --> 00:43:51.508]  However, if the wild card goes as wild as starting a war with Iran, then all bets are off, because they will keep us in the state of perpetual war.
[00:43:51.868 --> 00:43:55.430]  Look, they're keeping us in war now, even though we
[00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:01.902]  ...why we're in Iraq are bogus.
[00:44:02.362 --> 00:44:08.045]  We were told there were weapons of mass destruction, we were told there were ties to al-Qaeda, and they weren't there.
[00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:09.686]  We're still there.
[00:44:10.086 --> 00:44:16.489]  So if there's a real war with Iran, a major war, then our forecast changes.
[00:44:16.569 --> 00:44:18.990]  And again, we can't predict the wild cards...
[00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:22.913]  He just put out a new fake report saying Iran had nukes.
[00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:25.175]  That's now been proven to be fraudulent.
[00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:26.376]  They're trying the same playbook.
[00:44:26.657 --> 00:44:30.100]  Gerald, I want to go to calls here, but I wanted to ask you this question.
[00:44:30.881 --> 00:44:42.131]  I'm sure you saw the Bloomberg article a few weeks ago where Goldman Sachs is arming its employees against the citizens and expect lynch mobs, literally the villagers with pitchforks, to come.
[00:44:43.292 --> 00:44:45.815]  Again, they're criminals that have committed these crimes.
[00:44:46.215 --> 00:44:49.078]  They can't believe that we're putting up with it.
[00:44:49.259 --> 00:44:50.660]  They know they're criminal.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.422]  They know they've been bad.
[00:44:53.022 --> 00:44:53.903]  Can you speak to that?
[00:44:54.644 --> 00:44:59.029]  Well, listen to Lloyd Blankfein, the head of the Goldman Sachs gang.
[00:44:59.569 --> 00:45:01.871]  He has the nerve to say he's doing God's work.
[00:45:02.572 --> 00:45:05.355]  I mean, you know, these people are delusional in a lot of ways.
[00:45:05.375 --> 00:45:07.618]  Yeah, they know the people are after them.
[00:45:07.958 --> 00:45:11.763]  One of the trends we wrote about a year ago, it was off with their heads.
[00:45:12.163 --> 00:45:13.364]  We saw this coming.
[00:45:13.625 --> 00:45:15.046]  Yeah, they know they're in trouble.
[00:45:15.427 --> 00:45:16.548]  And so is, by the way...
[00:45:17.609 --> 00:45:19.531]  The whole government is in trouble.
[00:45:19.551 --> 00:45:21.813]  They're so disconnected.
[00:45:22.273 --> 00:45:23.594]  And of course they're disconnected.
[00:45:23.634 --> 00:45:23.854]  Exactly.
[00:45:23.994 --> 00:45:34.563]  Even the Democrats on the grassroots, even the chairman of the party is against this health care bill that raises your taxes and cuts your benefits for the insurance companies who wrote it.
[00:45:34.883 --> 00:45:39.527]  The Democrats have now read it and they don't care if Republicans and Democrats don't want it.
[00:45:39.788 --> 00:45:42.089]  Some polls as high as 75% against.
[00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:43.531]  They're still going to pass it!
[00:45:44.557 --> 00:45:46.338]  And they did the same thing with talk.
[00:45:46.578 --> 00:45:48.378]  They do the same thing with everything.
[00:45:48.658 --> 00:45:56.101]  They cannot gauge the anger of the people because they are living privileged lives.
[00:45:56.761 --> 00:46:01.162]  Off with their heads came about because of the same reason.
[00:46:01.562 --> 00:46:02.783]  Let them eat cake.
[00:46:03.283 --> 00:46:05.646]  Give them a health insurance policy.
[00:46:05.986 --> 00:46:07.328]  It's the same thing.
[00:46:07.588 --> 00:46:20.844]  They don't have a clue of the anger and the real frustration because, and I say this over and over again, when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[00:46:21.164 --> 00:46:23.247]  And they're going to start to lose it.
[00:46:24.468 --> 00:46:39.626]  But if people are losing it and they start World War III and set up the draft, which they've been getting ready for, and run all these patriotic ads about Al-Qaeda hit us again today, they blew up the Washington Monument last month, you know, we've got to arrest your neighbors, they were criticizing the war.
[00:46:41.356 --> 00:46:44.919]  If everybody knows the government's criminal and robbed them, they're not going to buy this.
[00:46:45.339 --> 00:46:48.181]  And it's going to blow up even worse if they start World War III.
[00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:49.942]  Not necessarily.
[00:46:50.362 --> 00:46:54.625]  You know, people get very fearful, particularly the gutless.
[00:46:56.686 --> 00:47:02.790]  People actually believe that George Bush was going to come ride in on the white horse and save them.
[00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:07.133]  Remember, he was going to hunt down Bin Laden and bring him back dead or alive.
[00:47:07.373 --> 00:47:09.355]  How could you get away with such a cheap trick?
[00:47:09.815 --> 00:47:11.656]  So the point is, you get away with a lot.
[00:47:12.117 --> 00:47:18.161]  So if they bring this war to levels beyond what we could ever imagine, they'll be in full control.
[00:47:19.182 --> 00:47:25.567]  The flags will be waving, the yellow ribbons will be out there, and it'll be the same lines over and over again.
[00:47:26.688 --> 00:47:29.450]  But the lines are so sophomoric.
[00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:30.231]  I mean, it's just...
[00:47:31.946 --> 00:47:33.867]  Again, they believe George Bush!
[00:47:34.367 --> 00:47:35.688]  I mean, how bad could you get?
[00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:39.889]  After eight years of Bush, Mussolini could have been elected into office.
[00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:41.470]  And they brought in Obama.
[00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.671]  They believe this song and dance.
[00:47:44.071 --> 00:47:47.613]  I mean, how could any... It's the presidential reality show.
[00:47:47.913 --> 00:47:49.333]  Yeah, he shoots great hoops.
[00:47:49.774 --> 00:47:51.554]  And Michelle does the hula hoop.
[00:47:51.815 --> 00:47:53.975]  I mean, how could you get more sophomoric than that?
[00:47:56.016 --> 00:47:59.458]  And they'll give us some new idiot in three years, some new fad.
[00:48:00.895 --> 00:48:07.960]  Well, if we don't have a new third party, but we're forecasting the emergence of a new third party in 2012.
[00:48:09.081 --> 00:48:21.810]  And by the way, I made my reputation part of it back in 1988 when I had predicted in one of my books, Trend Tracking, that there'd be a new third party and someone like Ross Perot would be that kind of person.
[00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:22.771]  You even said his name!
[00:48:23.496 --> 00:48:26.257]  Yeah, I even wrote the name for some strange reason.
[00:48:26.758 --> 00:48:30.099]  And the same situation is available now.
[00:48:30.559 --> 00:48:35.622]  And with the internet, what we're doing right now is just the beginning.
[00:48:36.122 --> 00:48:39.804]  And it really starts to change now because of technology.
[00:48:41.065 --> 00:48:47.648]  People only watch about two minutes on the small screen a day, but they're watching six hours on the wide screen.
[00:48:48.128 --> 00:48:51.930]  Very soon, it's now, you could plug in from the small screen
[00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:54.312]  And have it broadcast widescreen.
[00:48:54.592 --> 00:49:03.181]  We're going to see new news divisions, new news networks, new entertainment networks, media based from the internet.
[00:49:03.201 --> 00:49:05.363]  Well that's what Fox News has already created.
[00:49:05.763 --> 00:49:09.827]  Sites that look like Prison Planet and InfoWars and they admit they're trying to doppelgang what I do.
[00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:13.127]  But they're not you.
[00:49:13.687 --> 00:49:14.468]  And they'll never be you.
[00:49:14.508 --> 00:49:15.629]  You can't copy you.
[00:49:15.969 --> 00:49:18.591]  But we're going to see new news.
[00:49:19.172 --> 00:49:21.974]  People are going to tune in to an internet candidate.
[00:49:22.575 --> 00:49:23.595]  They're more independent.
[00:49:23.615 --> 00:49:26.558]  But listen, I agree with you, Gerald, and I want to take a few calls here, but let me ask you this.
[00:49:26.998 --> 00:49:29.360]  They have the fake neocon.
[00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:32.283]  They have hijacked the rebellion.
[00:49:32.663 --> 00:49:39.669]  But if they ride the peaceful third party into a rat hole, that will only make it explode even bigger the next year.
[00:49:41.471 --> 00:49:45.133]  It may not happen because of the... Again, there's so many wild cards.
[00:49:45.173 --> 00:49:47.794]  What if we don't have net neutrality anymore?
[00:49:47.834 --> 00:49:49.255]  Then our forecasts are off.
[00:49:49.615 --> 00:49:56.339]  And by the way, Australia is now trying to pass legislation that will put them in the same league as China.
[00:49:57.339 --> 00:49:58.820]  So... They say that.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.281]  They say it's Chinese style.
[00:50:00.321 --> 00:50:00.961]  That's their quote.
[00:50:01.681 --> 00:50:03.843]  Gerald, I'm skipping this break for stations.
[00:50:03.883 --> 00:50:05.303]  It's a network break, so we can skip it.
[00:50:05.323 --> 00:50:06.084]  I want to talk to Andrea.
[00:50:06.949 --> 00:50:08.510]  Frank, Wayne, Josh and Joe.
[00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.851]  Guys, have your quick questions ready.
[00:50:10.131 --> 00:50:16.355]  But I want to ask you, any other quick trends for 2010 and forward you want to drop on us, Gerald Solente?
[00:50:16.975 --> 00:50:17.956]  Survivalism.
[00:50:18.716 --> 00:50:23.519]  And it's not going to the hills with AK-47s or cans of pork and beans.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:24.960]  It's at every level.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.741]  Be prepared for the worst.
[00:50:26.781 --> 00:50:28.182]  You always could pull back from it.
[00:50:28.562 --> 00:50:35.587]  I'm most concerned about Terra 2010, the prospects of calling bank holidays, not being able to get your money,
[00:50:39.749 --> 00:50:40.370]  Absolutely.
[00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:41.530]  Let's take a call.
[00:50:42.151 --> 00:50:43.492]  Andrea in South Carolina.
[00:50:43.512 --> 00:50:46.393]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster.
[00:50:46.413 --> 00:50:48.275]  Go ahead.
[00:50:48.595 --> 00:50:49.495]  Andre, excuse me.
[00:50:50.636 --> 00:50:51.737]  I'm reading way across the room.
[00:50:51.777 --> 00:50:52.077]  Go ahead.
[00:50:52.537 --> 00:50:53.198]  I hear you, man.
[00:50:53.318 --> 00:50:56.680]  I wanted to thank you for waking me up four years ago, member of 9-11 Truth.
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.221]  My question is this.
[00:50:58.621 --> 00:51:04.004]  When we look at this disgusting terror attack, perpetrated false flag operation against the American people,
[00:51:05.825 --> 00:51:09.828]  Can we look at the put options put on Delta Airlines?
[00:51:09.888 --> 00:51:15.092]  Because I checked the stocks last night, and they've dropped off 25% at least.
[00:51:15.593 --> 00:51:22.538]  So, I think these people are so greedy that they bet against Delta, and that will give us their fingerprint.
[00:51:22.738 --> 00:51:23.519]  What do you guys think?
[00:51:24.419 --> 00:51:25.640]  Well, of course they're greedy.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.541]  They'll do anything.
[00:51:26.581 --> 00:51:27.622]  They'll sell their mother.
[00:51:28.162 --> 00:51:32.786]  Look what Goldman Sachs does, is they get you to buy things that they're shorting.
[00:51:32.826 --> 00:51:34.507]  So, yeah, I don't put anything past anybody.
[00:51:35.746 --> 00:51:36.206]  Absolutely.
[00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:44.711]  I'm just hoping that if we can get that information out, the actual people who are profiting from this attack, that we can stir up the revolution that we need, man.
[00:51:44.731 --> 00:51:45.871]  We've got to get these people out here.
[00:51:45.931 --> 00:51:47.412]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Gerald.
[00:51:48.012 --> 00:51:48.432]  Thank you.
[00:51:49.193 --> 00:51:49.813]  Thank you, sir.
[00:51:49.853 --> 00:51:50.734]  I appreciate your call.
[00:51:50.934 --> 00:51:52.895]  Andre, I've got to move that screen closer.
[00:51:52.915 --> 00:51:54.055]  It's like way across the room.
[00:51:55.056 --> 00:51:57.097]  Let's talk to Frank in Ohio.
[00:51:57.197 --> 00:51:58.117]  Frank, you're on the air.
[00:51:58.137 --> 00:52:01.039]  Hey, God bless.
[00:52:01.299 --> 00:52:03.500]  People are being too myopic.
[00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:08.113]  And looking at stocks and things, I want them to envision and put a map.
[00:52:08.213 --> 00:52:13.057]  Most people don't even realize that Yemen is down at the south end of Saudi Arabia.
[00:52:13.898 --> 00:52:26.068]  And I want people to understand that this is a new world order, global race, and bid for power and power over the peoples and lands of places like Africa.
[00:52:26.308 --> 00:52:29.751]  And well it's that key, key port there right across from Africa.
[00:52:30.871 --> 00:52:59.558]  Well, the bid to take over the areas, the Red Sea, the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, the Arabian Sea, so this is divvying up what... Moscow and Beijing must be laughing their backside off and drinking toast as our own Congress and FBI and CIA destroy and Homeland Security destroy constitutional rights and Bill of Rights and just watch us just implode.
[00:53:00.522 --> 00:53:06.007]  Yeah, we are totally discredited worldwide.
[00:53:06.407 --> 00:53:08.509]  Everybody tried to give us a break with Obama.
[00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:10.230]  Now they're finding out he's even worse.
[00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.672]  And they give him a Peace Prize to make it a joke.
[00:53:13.272 --> 00:53:17.155]  Isn't this really the globalists setting America up as the bad guy, Gerald Solenta?
[00:53:18.376 --> 00:53:26.643]  I just spoke to a Russian correspondent that one of their colleagues attended the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh.
[00:53:27.995 --> 00:53:34.082]  They were, they could not believe the amount of police control going on.
[00:53:34.543 --> 00:53:43.854]  It made them feel as though they lived in the most democratic society in the world compared to what they saw in Pittsburgh.
[00:53:44.134 --> 00:53:45.816]  This is coming from a Russian.
[00:53:46.667 --> 00:53:48.187]  So that's how bad it is over here.
[00:53:48.227 --> 00:53:49.728]  Yeah, they're testing our police.
[00:53:49.768 --> 00:54:01.471]  They had cops looking for people outside during the day, and old women would walk out with bags out of a shop and go, Officer, I just bought something, and they would release a dog on them.
[00:54:01.791 --> 00:54:04.572]  I mean, how did they turn the cops into demons?
[00:54:05.172 --> 00:54:10.734]  Exactly, and this is what the Russians are saying, that they can't believe this is happening in America.
[00:54:11.334 --> 00:54:16.878]  Now, the other thing that Frank mentioned is where Yemen is, bordering Saudi Arabia, as we mentioned.
[00:54:18.639 --> 00:54:21.501]  Now, also, remember the coal.
[00:54:21.521 --> 00:54:23.643]  The USS Cole was blown up.
[00:54:23.663 --> 00:54:24.984]  They got bombed in Aden, yeah.
[00:54:26.072 --> 00:54:32.239]  Now, 25% of the world's oil moves through the straits in that area.
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:40.048]  So if we have a terror strike, and again, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., the Yemen government are all involved in this.
[00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:41.890]  There's a civil war going on there.
[00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.211]  It's their second in 15 years.
[00:54:44.511 --> 00:54:46.452]  Rebellions in the North and the South.
[00:54:46.812 --> 00:54:48.152]  Religious, tribal.
[00:54:48.553 --> 00:54:49.913]  It's a mess.
[00:54:50.273 --> 00:55:01.518]  And what they're doing, and there's absolutely no evidence, even coming from the Saudis, saying there's no evidence, they're blaming it on Iran.
[00:55:02.518 --> 00:55:03.819]  So put the pieces together.
[00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:11.282]  I just wanted to point out, if people put the map out, and this power under the guise of terrorism,
[00:55:11.795 --> 00:55:20.600]  Watching our poor American and blessed American military, boys and girls, going into country without declarations of war.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:29.645]  We're going to do a power grab in Iraq and on the other side on Afghanistan and then run into Pakistan.
[00:55:29.725 --> 00:55:32.627]  So we do see the globalist
[00:55:34.205 --> 00:55:37.567]  Uh, in there dividing up and conquering and taking over.
[00:55:37.627 --> 00:55:45.112]  And they've got a fake leftist in there to sell the left on going along with a warmonger worse than George Bush!
[00:55:45.692 --> 00:55:51.296]  And putting climate control and taxes, national taxes, on that.
[00:55:51.416 --> 00:56:02.243]  We can see how it's a power, power grab from both the American industrialists and using our boys and girls and military
[00:56:02.799 --> 00:56:04.942]  to do a power grab around the world.
[00:56:20.202 --> 00:56:20.742]  I think it's great.
[00:56:43.037 --> 00:56:45.058]  I think your movies are terrific.
[00:56:45.399 --> 00:56:47.140]  I get terrific comments from them.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.641]  I encourage everybody to watch them.
[00:56:50.061 --> 00:56:55.024]  And you're doing what few people do, and I applaud you for the brave stand you take.
[00:56:55.485 --> 00:56:59.307]  And I also want to mention, we know how difficult it is out there for everyone.
[00:56:59.867 --> 00:57:02.529]  And what we're doing, there's a discount request button.
[00:57:03.089 --> 00:57:08.211]  We try to make the Trends Journal available to everybody at any price they could afford.
[00:57:08.611 --> 00:57:09.771]  So please let us know.
[00:57:09.831 --> 00:57:11.932]  And Alex, keep up the great work.
[00:57:12.872 --> 00:57:23.355]  The feedback that we're getting from your CDs, The Obama Deception and The Fall of the Republic, day after day we get them.
[00:57:23.835 --> 00:57:35.884]  Thanking you and thanking me and thanking all of those that participated on it for doing our part and giving people the courage to also step forward and to do their part.
[00:57:36.144 --> 00:57:38.646]  Because that's the only way it's going to change.
[00:57:39.466 --> 00:57:41.247]  Well, I think there's no doubt at the end of the day.
[00:57:41.327 --> 00:57:44.088]  We're in a fight for our liberties, a fight for our freedoms.
[00:57:44.108 --> 00:57:46.688]  There's a global corporate takeover taking place.
[00:57:46.728 --> 00:57:50.010]  It uses all these boogeymen to get us to acquiesce to tyranny.
[00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:54.211]  But thanks to you and many others telling the truth, there is an awakening happening.
[00:57:54.231 --> 00:57:59.093]  And I think time and history and the truth is on our side, Gerald Cilente.
[00:57:59.213 --> 00:58:01.634]  I think in the end, we're going to beat these people.
[00:58:02.834 --> 00:58:05.255]  We either beat them or we go under.
[00:58:05.295 --> 00:58:06.735]  And I'm not for going under.
[00:58:07.095 --> 00:58:08.696]  So I say, let's win.
[00:58:10.387 --> 00:58:12.369]  Gerald, thank you so much for talking to us.
[00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:13.790]  We'll talk to you next year, my friend.
[00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:15.571]  Very happy New Year.
[00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:16.472]  You too.
[00:58:16.972 --> 00:58:18.313]  There goes Gerald Cilente.
[00:58:18.353 --> 00:58:30.063]  We have our special guest coming up in the next segment, in the next hour, fourth and final hour, straight ahead, right here on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:30.083 --> 00:58:31.704]  Stay with us.
[00:58:34.887 --> 00:58:36.448]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:37.389 --> 00:58:39.711]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:42.912 --> 00:58:45.533]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:45.933 --> 00:58:50.876]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:51.256 --> 00:58:52.997]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:53.297 --> 00:58:58.119]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:58.299 --> 00:58:59.259]  How much do you want?
[00:58:59.479 --> 00:59:00.240]  When do you want it?
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.201]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:03.321]  When will you need it?
[00:59:03.561 --> 00:59:05.622]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:05.762 --> 00:59:06.863]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:07.103 --> 00:59:08.443]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:08.644 --> 00:59:09.644]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:59:09.684 --> 00:59:10.084]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:26.554 --> 00:59:29.315]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:29.595 --> 00:59:31.776]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:31.796 --> 00:59:32.796]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:32.816 --> 00:59:33.977]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:34.017 --> 00:59:35.837]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:13.817 --> 01:00:29.111]  Well, they got on a flight from Amsterdam into the United States and they saw some very interesting things happen.
[01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:34.718]  On the concourse, in the airport, into the plane, and on the plane.
[01:00:36.804 --> 01:00:44.048]  And, of course, he's a lawyer, a really good witness, trained to be able to document and be careful about what he says he saw.
[01:00:44.868 --> 01:00:47.210]  And the other witnesses are saying the exact same thing.
[01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:49.711]  Very, very bizarre.
[01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:57.835]  You have the sharp-dressed man leading the underwear bomber onto the plane through security, saying you have to let him on.
[01:00:57.895 --> 01:00:58.896]  He's from Sudan.
[01:00:59.636 --> 01:01:04.579]  You have someone videotaping, reportedly, the entire flight and aiming the camera at him.
[01:01:05.339 --> 01:01:10.524]  And I kept saying, why does the FBI want to talk to Mr. Haskell, Kurt and Lori Haskell?
[01:01:11.045 --> 01:01:13.147]  And we appreciate him coming on right now.
[01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:18.312]  He had to come on in the last hour because the FBI was there just before he came on with us.
[01:01:18.973 --> 01:01:20.194]  So, breaking news there.
[01:01:20.935 --> 01:01:25.680]  Kurt Haskell again, who was on flight 253 with the underwear bomber.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.921]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[01:01:27.282 --> 01:01:27.922]  Hey, no problem.
[01:01:27.942 --> 01:01:28.423]  Glad to be here.
[01:01:29.661 --> 01:01:37.002]  Well, tell us, again, a snapshot of any new developments or what the authorities just asked you about.
[01:01:38.543 --> 01:01:38.903]  Okay.
[01:01:38.923 --> 01:01:46.024]  Yeah, I got a call early this morning that the FBI would be stopping in my office to talk to me sometime today, and they did.
[01:01:46.044 --> 01:01:47.184]  They left a little while ago.
[01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:55.206]  Our interview today was pretty similar to the interview they gave me
[01:01:56.235 --> 01:02:11.759]  Uh, well, we were being detained in customs after we got off the plane with one exception, that I would say, and that was that they brought a stack of pictures they wanted me to look at and identify if I knew various people that they showed me.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.360]  Pictures of people.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.421]  Did you recognize the Indian man, the smart-dressed man?
[01:02:18.186 --> 01:02:20.028]  No, he was not in any of the pictures.
[01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:22.271]  Well, why wouldn't they have the airport footage?
[01:02:22.331 --> 01:02:23.432]  It's been five days.
[01:02:23.472 --> 01:02:24.814]  This is the biggest story ever.
[01:02:25.154 --> 01:02:27.537]  I mean, where is that surveillance footage from Amsterdam?
[01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.639]  You know what I said to them?
[01:02:31.363 --> 01:02:34.444]  Did you guys bring the security video from Amsterdam?
[01:02:34.464 --> 01:02:38.666]  Wouldn't that be a more appropriate way to do this interview while we looked at security video?
[01:02:39.186 --> 01:02:40.786]  I don't think they liked that comment from me.
[01:02:40.926 --> 01:02:42.007]  Well, it's common sense.
[01:02:42.047 --> 01:02:44.108]  I mean, you're a successful, smart lawyer.
[01:02:44.168 --> 01:02:44.908]  You're a sharp guy.
[01:02:45.088 --> 01:02:46.708]  But these FBI agents, they're sharp.
[01:02:46.748 --> 01:02:47.349]  They're accountants.
[01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:47.909]  They're lawyers.
[01:02:48.129 --> 01:02:48.769]  What's the deal?
[01:02:49.329 --> 01:02:50.110]  That's what I said.
[01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:52.551]  Did you bring that video with you so we could go over it together?
[01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:53.731]  Wouldn't that be more appropriate?
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.401]  And I think that was an offensive comment.
[01:02:58.142 --> 01:02:59.422]  Why would that be offensive?
[01:02:59.482 --> 01:03:02.603]  I mean, again, this is all part of the fake make-work.
[01:03:02.643 --> 01:03:04.924]  We saw this with Oklahoma City and other suspicious events.
[01:03:05.225 --> 01:03:12.948]  They'll just bring a boatload of papers and stuff that doesn't matter, and then your information that is so vital will go into the deep six bin.
[01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:20.571]  And that's why I wanted to get you on, Mr. Haskell, but I think you're now experiencing what I wanted to warn you about, about vital witnesses just getting ignored.
[01:03:23.454 --> 01:03:32.679]  I kind of want to keep this interview to me being an eyewitness and not me being expert testimony.
[01:03:32.699 --> 01:03:36.441]  Are you talking about with the FBI or right down here on air?
[01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:43.425]  No, what I'm saying is I want to keep, yeah, right here on air, I want to keep it to what I witnessed and not so much what my opinion is.
[01:03:44.925 --> 01:03:46.626]  Absolutely, that makes sense to do that.
[01:03:48.624 --> 01:04:01.711]  You know, I'm an eyewitness in this case, not an expert witness, and I don't want anyone accusing me of having any kind of an agenda to discredit the facts of this case and what I've witnessed.
[01:04:01.811 --> 01:04:02.932]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:04:02.952 --> 01:04:10.036]  I mean, that makes sense because, I mean, if you start making your opinions made, then they can try to ignore the key info you brought forward.
[01:04:10.116 --> 01:04:11.777]  And use that against me to discredit me.
[01:04:12.341 --> 01:04:12.722]  Exactly.
[01:04:12.742 --> 01:04:14.905]  I'm trying to not do anything to discredit myself.
[01:04:14.986 --> 01:04:16.128]  But there are other witnesses.
[01:04:16.168 --> 01:04:20.836]  We're now seeing other witnesses saying they saw the guy with the camera and everything else.
[01:04:21.236 --> 01:04:21.477]  Okay.
[01:04:22.038 --> 01:04:22.178]  Yeah.
[01:04:23.697 --> 01:04:27.520]  Well, let's talk about what you saw then, because we've got you to the bottom of the hour.
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.202]  Plenty of time to flesh this out.
[01:04:29.222 --> 01:04:42.153]  You know, instead of like five minutes on CNN or ten minutes on Fox, plenty of time for you to be able to break down in fine detail what you saw, what you witnessed, and we're really excited to have Kurt Haskell on with us.
[01:04:42.213 --> 01:04:47.898]  His wife, Lori Haskell, was also on the aircraft, bombed by the underwear bomber.
[01:04:48.298 --> 01:04:50.280]  We're glad that he's certainly alive right now.
[01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:57.337]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:04:57.457 --> 01:05:01.823]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:01.983 --> 01:05:03.846]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:04.266 --> 01:05:05.628]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:05.888 --> 01:05:06.950]  There is a solution.

[01:06:51.943 --> 01:06:56.165]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:56.485 --> 01:07:00.567]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:00.827 --> 01:07:06.230]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:07.030]  It's true.
[01:07:07.331 --> 01:07:11.873]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:12.173 --> 01:07:12.734]  Number 3.
[01:07:13.014 --> 01:07:16.297]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:16.597 --> 01:07:20.340]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.061]  Number 4.
[01:07:21.301 --> 01:07:23.683]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:27.466]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:27.746 --> 01:07:27.967]  Number 5.
[01:07:28.527 --> 01:07:32.449]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:32.669 --> 01:07:37.451]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:04.654]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.274 --> 01:08:08.936]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.476 --> 01:08:13.558]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:15.279 --> 01:08:18.921]  Well, Kurt and Lori Haskell have been on an African vacation.
[01:08:20.114 --> 01:08:22.535]  They were over there sightseeing, a sightseeing safari.
[01:08:23.535 --> 01:08:26.737]  Coming back through Amsterdam, things got a bit hairy.
[01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:31.718]  Coming into Detroit from Amsterdam, he runs the Haskell Law Firm.
[01:08:31.758 --> 01:08:32.539]  Very busy person.
[01:08:32.559 --> 01:08:33.899]  We appreciate him joining us.
[01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:43.203]  He just had the FBI in his office, but he is aware of Infowars.com, and so we appreciate him coming on the show with all the hundreds of media requests he is no doubt getting.
[01:08:43.543 --> 01:08:48.425]  Okay, just telling the story, but finishing up what we talked about in the last segment, then telling the story, sir.
[01:08:49.105 --> 01:08:59.071]  The first thing you asked, you said, to the FBI was, why are you here interviewing me about this and showing me photos when you have the surveillance footage from Amsterdam?
[01:08:59.351 --> 01:09:00.572]  Finish up with what happened there.
[01:09:00.812 --> 01:09:03.794]  Well, just to be straight, I don't assume anything.
[01:09:03.994 --> 01:09:10.758]  I said, wouldn't it be more appropriate that you brought the video from Amsterdam so that we could go over it together?
[01:09:10.778 --> 01:09:14.960]  And that seems to me like that would be a good starting point.
[01:09:15.121 --> 01:09:16.501]  I didn't assume that they had it.
[01:09:16.521 --> 01:09:17.462]  I actually asked them.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.381]  I asked them, you do have it, correct?
[01:09:20.701 --> 01:09:22.202]  And they gave me no response.
[01:09:22.823 --> 01:09:23.223]  Oh boy.
[01:09:24.124 --> 01:09:26.045]  Right.
[01:09:26.285 --> 01:09:32.689]  I asked them several questions related to things like that while they're here and they refused to answer anything whatsoever.
[01:09:34.089 --> 01:09:38.712]  They said they're here to get information from me, not me getting information from them.
[01:09:40.773 --> 01:09:41.074]  Really?
[01:09:41.154 --> 01:09:44.796]  I thought in an investigation people are supposed to, witnesses are supposed to
[01:09:46.255 --> 01:09:49.076]  You know, bring up anything they think is important.
[01:09:49.816 --> 01:09:49.996]  Right.
[01:09:51.097 --> 01:09:51.297]  Hmm.
[01:09:51.677 --> 01:09:56.199]  Which I did, but you'd think there'd be some collaboration there, but... Amazing.
[01:09:56.459 --> 01:10:00.420]  Did anything else in this interview not go well or seem strange?
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:01.560]  Go well?
[01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:04.862]  Well, you know, it was very similar to the one I did in Customs.
[01:10:05.142 --> 01:10:10.764]  You know, basic questions, take me through everything, what did you see, can you describe the people that you saw, etc, etc.
[01:10:12.136 --> 01:10:23.699]  With one exception is that they had a stack of pictures and they went through them one by one with me and asked me to identify each person or not to see if I saw them anywhere or not.
[01:10:24.739 --> 01:10:25.699]  That was the one difference.
[01:10:27.639 --> 01:10:28.760]  Amazing.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.080]  It was about ten pictures or so.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:38.442]  Two of them, two of the pictures were of the terrorist man and
[01:10:39.983 --> 01:10:41.124]  They kind of tried to trick me.
[01:10:41.184 --> 01:10:44.367]  They acted like it was two different people, to see if I would agree.
[01:10:44.387 --> 01:10:49.111]  Oh, well I was going to predict that, but I wanted you to say it yourself.
[01:10:49.131 --> 01:10:54.016]  I mean, if they are trying to cover up the investigation and screw it up, this is standard procedure.
[01:10:54.316 --> 01:11:05.446]  Now they're trying to impeach the witness, because they really don't like what you saw, so we need to demand all of the airport video be released, not one video that was shooting a sidewall.
[01:11:07.909 --> 01:11:09.189]  Here's how it went down.
[01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:12.351]  Just so you know, again, I'm not making any opinions.
[01:11:12.391 --> 01:11:14.113]  I'm just stating what I witnessed.
[01:11:14.653 --> 01:11:17.575]  He gave me a picture of the terrorist.
[01:11:18.015 --> 01:11:19.456]  I don't know what his name is exactly.
[01:11:19.496 --> 01:11:20.437]  It's a long Muslim name.
[01:11:20.497 --> 01:11:21.757]  I'm just going to call him the terrorist.
[01:11:21.878 --> 01:11:22.878]  I said, OK, that's him.
[01:11:23.859 --> 01:11:25.800]  And then they said, can you identify this guy?
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:30.583]  And it looked to me like it was the terrorist again.
[01:11:30.623 --> 01:11:34.886]  And I said, is this some kind of trick where if I answer this wrong,
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:46.585]  Uh, you guys are going to try and use some kind of smear tactic against me to discredit me, and they kind of laughed, and I said, uh, it looks like the terrorist again, but why don't you give me a full body shot?
[01:11:46.685 --> 01:11:52.848]  Because, you know, part of myself identifying this man had to do with his entire body, because he looked a little different.
[01:11:53.269 --> 01:11:54.349]  His skeletal form.
[01:11:55.050 --> 01:12:01.753]  Yeah, he's a short, skinny guy, and they were giving me, uh, head shots only, and I said, well, why don't you give me a full body picture?
[01:12:02.734 --> 01:12:07.298]  Maybe I can tell you if this is a terrorist also or some man that I didn't see.
[01:12:08.059 --> 01:12:08.359]  Wow.
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.982]  But they didn't have any of those.
[01:12:11.062 --> 01:12:14.305]  One other picture was kind of funny to me.
[01:12:15.586 --> 01:12:18.689]  They showed me a picture of a man and they said, do you know this man?
[01:12:18.749 --> 01:12:21.291]  And I said, I looked at them and I kind of laughed and I said,
[01:12:23.368 --> 01:12:30.332]  Isn't this the man that had the bomb in his carry-on bag that you arrested in customs that you refused to admit exists?
[01:12:31.492 --> 01:12:34.874]  They didn't really like that comment from me and had no comment back to me.
[01:12:34.914 --> 01:12:38.496]  But I said, it sure looks like it's the man you refused to admit exists.
[01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:41.357]  Really?
[01:12:41.677 --> 01:12:44.259]  I don't know if you read that part of my story anywhere either.
[01:12:44.419 --> 01:12:47.200]  Yes, but flesh that out for folks that aren't aware of it.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.601]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:12:49.341 --> 01:12:52.983]  When we got off the plane, we were being held in customs for a six-hour time period.
[01:12:53.795 --> 01:12:56.716]  And they brought in some bomb-sniffing dogs after about an hour.
[01:12:58.116 --> 01:13:01.816]  One of the dogs found something in one of the carry-on bags of an Indian man.
[01:13:01.876 --> 01:13:06.157]  Now, this is a different Indian man than the one I saw pre-boarding.
[01:13:06.377 --> 01:13:08.638]  He was a younger man, about 30, age 30.
[01:13:10.078 --> 01:13:16.759]  And he was immediately taken into an interrogation room, held there for about an hour, and he came out and was handcuffed and taken away.
[01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:21.200]  Immediately after he was taken away, we were moved to another location.
[01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:26.426]  Uh, and one of the, one of the FBI agents said the following, you're being moved.
[01:13:26.706 --> 01:13:27.727]  It's not safe here.
[01:13:28.587 --> 01:13:32.828]  You, I'm sure you all saw what happened and can read between the lines and why you're being moved.
[01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:38.790]  Read into, read into that what you will.
[01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:39.971]  Wow.
[01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:46.533]  You know, but, um, nobody will mention this part of my story anywhere.
[01:13:46.673 --> 01:13:49.994]  And you know, everyone in the plane or a majority of them saw this.
[01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:51.094]  We're all in the same room.
[01:13:53.436 --> 01:13:56.277]  Again, we're talking to eyewitness Kurt Haskell.
[01:13:56.317 --> 01:13:58.339]  His wife saw much of the similar information.
[01:13:58.359 --> 01:14:01.501]  Other witnesses are corroborating a lot of what they're talking about.
[01:14:01.881 --> 01:14:04.422]  Take your time, because we have the time.
[01:14:04.442 --> 01:14:09.025]  Then I want to get into what you saw getting on the plane once you were on the plane, the time we have.
[01:14:09.305 --> 01:14:10.566]  I'm skipping the next break coming up.
[01:14:10.586 --> 01:14:11.627]  We have it to the bottom of the hour.
[01:14:11.827 --> 01:14:12.848]  We've got 16 minutes.
[01:14:14.048 --> 01:14:17.611]  Any detail, anything specific?
[01:14:17.651 --> 01:14:21.173]  Start over, slowly retell what you just told us.
[01:14:22.389 --> 01:14:23.290]  What I just told you?
[01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:23.950]  Yes.
[01:14:25.151 --> 01:14:26.432]  About being in customs?
[01:14:26.812 --> 01:14:27.072]  Yes.
[01:14:27.632 --> 01:14:28.713]  Okay, slowly.
[01:14:30.534 --> 01:14:32.556]  We got off the plane.
[01:14:32.776 --> 01:14:36.178]  We were held in customs in a large baggage claim room.
[01:14:37.219 --> 01:14:41.802]  Held there for about an hour with only our carry-on bags, all of us together, all the passengers.
[01:14:42.922 --> 01:14:46.445]  Bomb-sniffing dogs arrived approximately one hour later.
[01:14:47.706 --> 01:14:49.967]  One of the dogs smelled something in the bag of a 30-ish
[01:14:51.907 --> 01:14:53.467]  What I would say, again, an Indian man.
[01:14:53.508 --> 01:14:55.208]  He looked like he was from India to me.
[01:14:57.449 --> 01:15:00.189]  The dog sat there, like he's trained to do if he finds something.
[01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:06.851]  An officer immediately came over and took the man and took the bag into what I would call an interrogation room.
[01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:11.752]  I couldn't see in the room, but I could see the entry door to the room.
[01:15:12.373 --> 01:15:13.713]  He was there approximately an hour.
[01:15:13.733 --> 01:15:16.794]  I saw him come out about an hour later.
[01:15:18.034 --> 01:15:19.795]  He was handcuffed and taken away.
[01:15:21.525 --> 01:15:30.596]  Immediately after this, we were moved to a different location, and an FBI agent said something close to the following.
[01:15:30.636 --> 01:15:32.878]  This isn't an exact quote, but similar.
[01:15:33.199 --> 01:15:35.922]  You're being moved to a new location because it's not safe here.
[01:15:36.403 --> 01:15:40.187]  I'm sure you all saw what happened and can read between the lines on why you're being moved.
[01:15:41.598 --> 01:15:44.940]  Now they were probably taking one of their handlers or agents off the plane.
[01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:46.762]  This is devastating info.
[01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:50.845]  And Mr. Haskell, you've been trying to tell the mainstream media that information.
[01:15:52.866 --> 01:15:58.130]  You know, I tell the same story to everyone unless they just want to ask me specific questions.
[01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.071]  You know, if they want to do that, that's fine.
[01:16:00.231 --> 01:16:03.193]  But the point is you've been trying to tell this and it's been filtered out.
[01:16:03.994 --> 01:16:04.414]  I'm sorry?
[01:16:05.075 --> 01:16:06.876]  But you've been trying to get this information out.
[01:16:07.489 --> 01:16:11.310]  Well, you know, I just tell my story, what's done with it.
[01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:13.071]  I understand, but I mean, you made the point.
[01:16:13.091 --> 01:16:15.291]  I haven't seen this anywhere in the media.
[01:16:15.391 --> 01:16:16.252]  This is big news.
[01:16:16.452 --> 01:16:18.012]  Well, I know, I know that.
[01:16:18.632 --> 01:16:23.954]  I repeated that same story to countless news agencies.
[01:16:23.994 --> 01:16:32.797]  Now, not all of them, because some of them just want to do a two or three minute blurb on me and, you know, what I saw when it was going on or Mr. Sharp Trust Man or what have you.
[01:16:33.657 --> 01:16:36.398]  But to my knowledge, not one
[01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:43.767]  Yeah, this stinks.
[01:16:46.109 --> 01:16:47.791]  This stinks to high heaven.
[01:16:47.811 --> 01:16:49.712]  I know you're just robotically giving us the facts.
[01:16:50.213 --> 01:16:52.015]  As a good lawyer, you understand that.
[01:16:52.335 --> 01:16:53.536]  I can obviously speculate.
[01:16:53.816 --> 01:16:56.138]  This is really stinking to high heaven as a cover-up.
[01:16:56.419 --> 01:16:57.099]  A cover-up of what?
[01:16:57.139 --> 01:16:57.660]  We're not sure.
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:01.643]  Now expanding here, going to the beginning.
[01:17:02.604 --> 01:17:04.445]  Or any other bombshells you want to drop on us.
[01:17:04.465 --> 01:17:06.767]  But going back to the beginning, more about this sharp-dressed man.
[01:17:07.127 --> 01:17:11.309]  More about how he was getting him on the aircraft with these international flights.
[01:17:11.329 --> 01:17:12.890]  You've got to show the passport again.
[01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:14.431]  I've done that myself many times.
[01:17:14.911 --> 01:17:15.632]  You know, at the gate.
[01:17:15.912 --> 01:17:16.792]  This doesn't happen.
[01:17:17.273 --> 01:17:19.494]  Why was this guy given such deference?
[01:17:19.514 --> 01:17:20.875]  Did he look like security?
[01:17:21.255 --> 01:17:22.455]  Did he flash anything?
[01:17:22.576 --> 01:17:23.616]  Go back to the time.
[01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:25.537]  Slowly tell us what you saw.
[01:17:25.617 --> 01:17:30.200]  And then, anything interesting about the underwear bomber himself?
[01:17:31.613 --> 01:17:31.833]  Okay.
[01:17:32.234 --> 01:17:35.756]  So, before we boarded, obviously we're in Amsterdam.
[01:17:36.196 --> 01:17:47.624]  It was just my wife and I. There weren't any seats in the boarding area, so we sat on the floor by what I would call the ticket agent, the last person that checks your boarding pass before you board the plane.
[01:17:48.045 --> 01:17:50.266]  We're about 10 feet away or so, just playing cards.
[01:17:51.227 --> 01:18:01.234]  And, you know, passing time, and I was kind of people-watching, and I saw these two men approach the ticket agent, and they just kind of caught my eye because it seemed strange to me that they were together.
[01:18:02.003 --> 01:18:12.690]  Uh, one I would describe as, uh, he looked like he was a poor, uh, a black teenager is how I would describe him, 16, 17 years old or so.
[01:18:14.692 --> 01:18:16.533]  What I thought was 16 or 17 years old.
[01:18:16.593 --> 01:18:18.234]  And the other man looked like a 50-ish.
[01:18:18.634 --> 01:18:19.435]  He looked wealthy.
[01:18:20.035 --> 01:18:25.599]  Indian, what I would say Indian man now, you know, whether he's of a similar race or something, I don't know.
[01:18:25.619 --> 01:18:28.381]  But to me, it looked like he was from India.
[01:18:29.021 --> 01:18:31.183]  And, uh, they approached this ticket agent together.
[01:18:31.861 --> 01:18:34.042]  It was quiet, and I could hear the entire conversation.
[01:18:34.542 --> 01:18:39.545]  Only the Indian man spoke, not the black man, and what he said was, this man needs to board the plane.
[01:18:39.685 --> 01:18:40.785]  He doesn't have a passport.
[01:18:41.966 --> 01:18:47.068]  The ticket agent then responded, well, if you don't have a passport, you can't board the plane.
[01:18:47.368 --> 01:18:51.230]  And then the Indian man responded, he's from Sudan.
[01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:52.511]  We do this all the time.
[01:18:53.231 --> 01:19:00.975]  And the ticket agent then said, well, you'll need to talk to my manager or something along those lines, and pointed the two men down a hallway to go speak to the manager.
[01:19:01.901 --> 01:19:03.422]  They then proceeded down the hallway.
[01:19:04.002 --> 01:19:07.003]  This was the only time I saw this particular Indian man.
[01:19:07.023 --> 01:19:12.424]  This was the only time I saw the black man until he tried to blow up our plane a few hours later.
[01:19:12.444 --> 01:19:13.244]  Okay, going back.
[01:19:13.644 --> 01:19:17.125]  So you must have gotten on the plane before him or something.
[01:19:17.166 --> 01:19:18.606]  You didn't see how he got on.
[01:19:19.026 --> 01:19:22.687]  No, because shortly after this, shortly after they went down the hallway, we boarded the plane.
[01:19:27.288 --> 01:19:27.729]  And then, wow.
[01:19:30.367 --> 01:19:33.369]  And obviously, everyone should be talking.
[01:19:33.409 --> 01:19:34.690]  It should be all over the news.
[01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:36.471]  Who was the mystery man?
[01:19:36.811 --> 01:19:38.172]  Who could get through security?
[01:19:38.653 --> 01:19:39.973]  Who could bring this guy in?
[01:19:40.034 --> 01:19:46.398]  Who could get people on airplanes without passports, international flights, into the United States, some of the highest security in the world?
[01:19:46.938 --> 01:19:49.420]  I mean, this just gets crazier and crazier, Mr. Haskell.
[01:19:51.641 --> 01:19:52.082]  Uh-oh.
[01:19:54.103 --> 01:19:55.844]  We just lost his phone line.
[01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.526]  Connection to Michigan.
[01:20:01.309 --> 01:20:01.429]  Oh.
[01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:05.452]  Only seems to happen at times like that.
[01:20:06.672 --> 01:20:10.875]  And if you don't think they're surveilling Mr. Haskell, you're living on another planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:13.957]  Oh, doesn't matter.
[01:20:14.037 --> 01:20:14.817]  The info's out.
[01:20:17.339 --> 01:20:19.901]  I've had some private conversations with Mr. Haskell.
[01:20:22.022 --> 01:20:25.284]  But, I do wear a journalist hat as part of what I do.
[01:20:25.324 --> 01:20:26.325]  I'm also a filmmaker.
[01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:28.306]  I do editorialize as well.
[01:20:29.146 --> 01:20:30.007]  Also preach a bit.
[01:20:31.448 --> 01:20:37.150]  Some say rabble-rouse, but I do wear a journalist hat and what is said in confidence is said in confidence.
[01:20:41.252 --> 01:20:43.292]  Absolutely amazing that that just happened.
[01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:46.133]  Okay, we have Mr. Haskell back.
[01:20:46.153 --> 01:20:47.774]  Hopefully we can keep him for the last 10 minutes.
[01:20:47.814 --> 01:20:49.475]  Mr. Haskell, sorry you got cut off.
[01:20:49.755 --> 01:20:50.295]  No problem.
[01:20:51.595 --> 01:20:55.337]  Okay, we were getting up to the point, just briefly, of
[01:20:57.546 --> 01:20:59.327]  How could this person get him on the plane?
[01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:04.008]  I mean, what gravitas did he have with airport security?
[01:21:05.349 --> 01:21:05.949]  You're asking me?
[01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:06.849]  Yes, sir.
[01:21:07.869 --> 01:21:16.752]  I really don't want to speculate on it other than, you know, I can see three possibilities, and which one you think it was, I don't know.
[01:21:17.433 --> 01:21:21.194]  Three would be, there was a bribe.
[01:21:22.065 --> 01:21:27.546]  There was some sort of personal relationship between this man and the security manager.
[01:21:28.146 --> 01:21:36.748]  And number three would be that this is a regular routine procedure to get on planes without a passport for refugees of war-torn countries.
[01:21:37.648 --> 01:21:38.268]  Well, it's not.
[01:21:38.288 --> 01:21:41.089]  They've got to get special letters from the embassy.
[01:21:41.349 --> 01:21:44.009]  Pick which one of the three you think it is.
[01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:46.290]  To me, those are the only choices.
[01:21:47.086 --> 01:21:52.207]  Or he was a intelligence agent telling the young fool he was part of a drill.
[01:21:53.828 --> 01:21:54.088]  Okay.
[01:21:56.968 --> 01:21:57.289]  Wow.
[01:21:58.069 --> 01:22:02.330]  Okay, once you're on the plane, you're coming into Detroit, what happens next?
[01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:05.851]  It was a really uneventful flight.
[01:22:05.891 --> 01:22:08.751]  We're in the middle of our descent into Detroit.
[01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:13.413]  The pilot comes on, the speaker, and he says we have 10 minutes to landing.
[01:22:13.473 --> 01:22:15.193]  Flight crew, take your seats and buckle up.
[01:22:16.178 --> 01:22:21.341]  A flight attendant walks by my seat, mumbling to herself, something smells like smoke.
[01:22:23.923 --> 01:22:24.543]  I look up.
[01:22:24.583 --> 01:22:31.708]  I'd previously been looking at the monitor on the back of the seat in front of me to get the flight conditions and everything, because I like to watch that when we're landing.
[01:22:32.168 --> 01:22:32.668]  I looked up.
[01:22:33.829 --> 01:22:34.509]  I'm in row 27.
[01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:38.512]  I could see smoke coming from row 19, eight rows up.
[01:22:39.689 --> 01:22:41.930]  It wasn't a lot of smoke at that time.
[01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:46.231]  It looked like it was coming from the floor, but I couldn't see the floor because I was sitting down.
[01:22:46.931 --> 01:22:57.854]  So I unbuckled my seatbelt, took a few steps up the aisle to get a better look, and then it burst into flames across the floor of the seats and up the wall to the ceiling.
[01:22:58.514 --> 01:23:06.557]  Just in row 19 and just to the seats left of the left aisle, which I think there were three seats, A, B, and C.
[01:23:10.154 --> 01:23:18.242]  When it burst into flames, people were screaming, fire, fire, terrorists, water, water, water, we need water, somebody get water.
[01:23:19.403 --> 01:23:20.744]  Flight attendants were screaming.
[01:23:20.784 --> 01:23:24.648]  The pilot comes on the intercom and says emergency landing and starts speeding up.
[01:23:25.429 --> 01:23:29.613]  And while this is going on, the terrorist man is being hauled off into the first class area.
[01:23:30.342 --> 01:23:31.503]  By a couple passengers.
[01:23:32.344 --> 01:23:33.646]  He didn't really put up any fight.
[01:23:46.339 --> 01:23:47.959]  I didn't see that, so I can't confirm that.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:48.520]  Okay, good.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.180]  I mean, I hope that's not true.
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.941]  They were so foolish, they wanted to wait for orders.
[01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:55.421]  But, okay, continuing.
[01:23:55.461 --> 01:23:57.442]  So they drag him up into first class.
[01:23:57.922 --> 01:24:01.583]  Now, did you hear this popping noise, or how loud was it?
[01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:06.424]  Because we heard about this big explosion, and then it was just a popping, and then people thought it was a firecracker.
[01:24:06.744 --> 01:24:07.384]  Okay.
[01:24:07.424 --> 01:24:08.504]  Honestly, I didn't hear a thing.
[01:24:08.964 --> 01:24:12.625]  I asked my wife if she heard anything, and this is what she says about it.
[01:24:13.143 --> 01:24:26.732]  It sounded like what I thought was the landing gear coming out, and then she said, I heard like a little popping noise after that, but I just thought it was ice breaking off from the opening of the landing gear because we had been in really cold weather.
[01:24:27.492 --> 01:24:29.814]  And she said, you know, I thought that's what it was.
[01:24:29.874 --> 01:24:30.914]  I didn't think anything of it.
[01:24:30.954 --> 01:24:33.236]  But myself, I didn't hear a thing, to be honest.
[01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:36.885]  Absolutely.
[01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:42.831]  Well, there are so many things, Mr. Haskell, to talk about here.
[01:24:42.871 --> 01:24:45.353]  In the last few minutes we've got, and I want to say bye to you during the break.
[01:24:46.154 --> 01:24:47.215]  I know you've got to go.
[01:24:47.255 --> 01:24:48.156]  We appreciate this time.
[01:24:48.837 --> 01:24:51.199]  In the last five minutes, any other points you'd like to make?
[01:24:51.339 --> 01:24:53.501]  Any key issues that haven't been discussed?
[01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:57.445]  And as a concerned citizen who could have been killed by this,
[01:24:58.146 --> 01:25:02.867]  As a free person, I mean, you do have a right to make any statements you want about the investigation.
[01:25:03.167 --> 01:25:06.408]  We are five days into this and we've not seen any surveillance footage.
[01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:14.489]  The media doesn't seem concerned about eyewitnesses seeing a man videotaping the whole flight aimed at this guy.
[01:25:14.889 --> 01:25:17.310]  That's obviously an accomplice or a handler or something.
[01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:19.970]  We've got this other guy getting him through security.
[01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:21.711]  I mean, any other comments?
[01:25:25.567 --> 01:25:27.569]  Just a couple things.
[01:25:27.589 --> 01:25:32.573]  I thought the security after getting off the plane was a complete embarrassment.
[01:25:33.054 --> 01:25:40.500]  A total disorganizational mess that actually put us in more jeopardy than we were already in.
[01:25:41.441 --> 01:25:43.743]  Just quickly, two things.
[01:25:43.783 --> 01:25:50.949]  They left us on the plane for 20 minutes after we landed, not knowing if there was a bomb anywhere or whether the fire had spread below the floor.
[01:25:51.818 --> 01:25:54.100]  Uh, into the cargo hold or by the gas tank.
[01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.921]  The original fire was directly above the gas tank.
[01:25:57.762 --> 01:25:59.943]  Uh, in row 19, seat 19A.
[01:26:00.624 --> 01:26:01.244]  Uh, number one.
[01:26:01.384 --> 01:26:13.551]  Number two, they should not have let us take our carry-on bags off the plane, and then even worse, stand all together with them for an hour before the bomb-sniffing dogs got there, not knowing if there was a bomb in any of the bags or not.
[01:26:14.212 --> 01:26:19.115]  And it looks like what appeared to be a bomb was discovered by one of the dogs, so...
[01:26:19.605 --> 01:26:26.508]  Those two things made us considerably less safe than we should have been due to what I would call a disorganizational mess.
[01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:31.289]  It appeared that none of the security officers had any clue on any procedure, what to do.
[01:26:31.309 --> 01:26:32.970]  They didn't know who was in charge.
[01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:41.473]  It really took a long time to organize themselves and organize some sort of procedure on how to handle things, and in the meantime put us in a lot of jeopardy.
[01:26:42.154 --> 01:26:45.715]  Okay, well... And if you want to question me on anything else, feel free.
[01:26:46.141 --> 01:26:54.986]  Well let me do that here at the end and hopefully we can have you back up a little bit in the days to come because you are and your wife are key eyewitnesses and again it's being confirmed by other people on the plane.
[01:26:55.006 --> 01:26:58.807]  We're going to play the clip after you leave saying this guy was videotaping the whole flight.
[01:26:59.128 --> 01:27:00.368]  They've given multiple interviews.
[01:27:00.468 --> 01:27:01.589]  Very suspicious there.
[01:27:02.169 --> 01:27:06.071]  I've been given a quote here from you being interviewed on a radio show.
[01:27:06.091 --> 01:27:07.352]  I want to find out if this is accurate.
[01:27:07.612 --> 01:27:10.673]  You did tell me that you visited Infowars.com from time to time.
[01:27:10.693 --> 01:27:10.994]  I did.
[01:27:11.094 --> 01:27:13.055]  And I understand this is separate.
[01:27:13.915 --> 01:27:22.378]  I want all the information to be public, put in the public, to inform the public, and to help law enforcement do whatever they can to solve this crisis.
[01:27:23.018 --> 01:27:34.522]  Eight years later, I am still irritated with 9-11 when I consider it to be a 9-11 cover-up, and I personally have knowledge with this terrorist attack, and I am not going to let anybody cover up what I know.
[01:27:35.102 --> 01:27:39.404]  Kurt Haskell, attorney, is that an accurate quote, and where was that said?
[01:27:41.334 --> 01:27:49.533]  It's an accurate quote, but I don't want to get into any more detail on that because I don't want any kind of smear campaign against myself to discredit this story, which is
[01:27:50.086 --> 01:27:51.507]  An entirely separate story.
[01:27:51.547 --> 01:27:52.207]  No, I understand.
[01:27:52.247 --> 01:27:53.368]  Well, there's other witnesses.
[01:27:53.388 --> 01:27:55.129]  They've got to release the surveillance footage.
[01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:58.231]  Other people are confirming things that happened.
[01:27:58.251 --> 01:28:00.773]  I mean, we know his dad warned everybody.
[01:28:00.813 --> 01:28:02.173]  We know he's on the terror list.
[01:28:02.494 --> 01:28:06.176]  He fits the classic MO of a decoy, of a patsy.
[01:28:06.336 --> 01:28:10.558]  I know you're just stating the facts, but they're not going to be able to ignore you and your wife's testimony.
[01:28:11.099 --> 01:28:14.461]  And I think it's important for you to go public now, which you've done.
[01:28:15.301 --> 01:28:19.124]  But just thank God that there's so many informed people out there.
[01:28:19.764 --> 01:28:22.625]  Kurt, bottom line, the FBI showed up.
[01:28:22.665 --> 01:28:28.226]  They were clearly trying to impeach your... I mean, they're clearly already aware of you.
[01:28:28.466 --> 01:28:32.287]  They're clearly upset by having a... I would say you are an expert witness.
[01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:34.228]  You're aware of this type of chicanery.
[01:28:34.248 --> 01:28:35.528]  You're a successful lawyer.
[01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:38.869]  Watch your six, is all I'm telling you.
[01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:43.330]  Yeah, I'm not scared of anybody, you know.
[01:28:43.911 --> 01:28:44.991]  Whatever happens, happens.
[01:28:45.551 --> 01:28:48.072]  Well, we need to get your wife on the air, too.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:53.582]  We need to get your wife... Just so you know, my wife is very ill today.
[01:28:53.642 --> 01:28:58.143]  She's come down with a bad case of the flu and she's really not doing any interviews today.
[01:28:59.024 --> 01:29:00.964]  Well, obviously our show's about to end.
[01:29:01.044 --> 01:29:04.206]  She fell very ill after that.
[01:29:04.286 --> 01:29:06.927]  Not from the interview, just she's pretty sick today.
[01:29:07.147 --> 01:29:07.887]  No, I understand.
[01:29:08.127 --> 01:29:08.947]  Air travel can do that.
[01:29:09.047 --> 01:29:10.128]  Obviously a stressful event.
[01:29:10.428 --> 01:29:11.868]  Well, we appreciate your courage.
[01:29:12.249 --> 01:29:18.511]  We appreciate you telling everybody in a great, very focused fashion, very accurate fashion, what happened.
[01:29:19.151 --> 01:29:21.533]  And we're all praying for you, Kurt Haskell, attorney.
[01:29:21.553 --> 01:29:23.594]  Let me say bye to you during this break.
[01:29:23.774 --> 01:29:27.236]  Obviously, listeners, this is an extremely powerful interview.
[01:29:27.556 --> 01:29:28.497]  Breaking news.
[01:29:28.817 --> 01:29:30.038]  You're hearing a lot of this here.
[01:29:30.458 --> 01:29:33.239]  First, great job to my team getting Mr. Haskell on.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.361]  Let me say bye to Mr. Haskell during the break.
[01:29:35.381 --> 01:29:36.141]  We'll come back with more.
[01:29:42.865 --> 01:29:43.746]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.246 --> 01:29:45.747]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.777 --> 01:29:49.455]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.209 --> 01:29:57.850]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:58.170 --> 01:30:06.293]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:07.033 --> 01:30:11.074]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:11.654 --> 01:30:22.478]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:23.098 --> 01:30:32.120]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:37.661]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:38.062 --> 01:30:45.223]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:45.543 --> 01:30:48.284]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:30:53.382 --> 01:30:57.026]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:57.406 --> 01:31:00.410]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:00.650 --> 01:31:05.435]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:05.455 --> 01:31:11.682]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:11.842 --> 01:31:14.085]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:14.605 --> 01:31:16.006]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:31:16.026 --> 01:31:16.746]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:16.766 --> 01:31:18.868]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:33.516 --> 01:31:37.441]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:31:37.902 --> 01:31:40.465]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:40.785 --> 01:31:49.896]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:52.622 --> 01:31:55.223]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:55.623 --> 01:32:00.526]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:00.886 --> 01:32:02.627]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:02.947 --> 01:32:07.749]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:07.929 --> 01:32:08.910]  How much do you want?
[01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:09.870]  When do you want it?
[01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:11.851]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:12.131 --> 01:32:12.952]  When will you need it?
[01:32:13.212 --> 01:32:15.273]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:15.413 --> 01:32:16.513]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:16.753 --> 01:32:18.054]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:18.274 --> 01:32:23.338]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:26.721]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:27.121 --> 01:32:30.624]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:31.926]  How much will you need?
[01:32:32.166 --> 01:32:32.786]  We don't know.
[01:32:33.066 --> 01:32:33.987]  How much do you want?
[01:32:34.187 --> 01:32:34.908]  All you can get.
[01:32:34.928 --> 01:32:35.909]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:38.950]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:40.991]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:41.011 --> 01:32:41.932]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:13.117 --> 01:33:15.118]  Well, he's agreed to come back on with us.
[01:33:15.379 --> 01:33:18.481]  There is a lot more to this incredible story.
[01:33:18.501 --> 01:33:21.723]  I'm going to try to get his wife on in the next few days with him.
[01:33:22.123 --> 01:33:24.044]  But regardless, this is breaking now.
[01:33:24.405 --> 01:33:26.906]  We need to make sure the real issues get investigated.
[01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:29.048]  Kurt Haskell, we appreciate your courage.
[01:33:29.308 --> 01:33:30.389]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[01:33:30.929 --> 01:33:31.630]  Hey, no problem.
[01:33:31.650 --> 01:33:39.775]  And I just wanted to let you know that if there's any interest of me coming on again to do a Q&A session or tell anything further, I'd be glad to do it at any time.
[01:33:39.835 --> 01:33:41.817]  I just have very limited time today.
[01:33:43.138 --> 01:33:45.880]  I can't do it today, but another time, I'd be more than willing.
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.821]  Thank you so much, Mr. Haskell.
[01:33:47.841 --> 01:33:48.201]  Take care.
[01:33:48.481 --> 01:33:48.901]  No problem.
[01:33:48.921 --> 01:33:49.461]  Have a good day.
[01:33:49.502 --> 01:33:49.842]  Thank you.
[01:33:50.202 --> 01:33:50.602]  Goodbye.
[01:33:52.023 --> 01:33:52.523]  Oh, man.
[01:33:53.083 --> 01:33:53.163]  Oh.
[01:33:54.144 --> 01:33:54.244]  Oh.
[01:33:56.365 --> 01:33:58.706]  Well, I tell you, talking to him off-air, whoo!
[01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:01.328]  This is really bad.
[01:34:03.689 --> 01:34:11.633]  Meanwhile, the neocons, like Michael Shermer, the Skeptics Magazine, their god, is going, oh, we need to rescind our 9-11 truth.
[01:34:15.026 --> 01:34:16.986]  It's been proven Al-Qaeda exists.
[01:34:17.487 --> 01:34:23.888]  Of course there are Muslim extremists all over the place, but Al-Qaeda is a CIA computer program name from 1979.
[01:34:24.428 --> 01:34:29.109]  Zbigniew Brzezinski's written two books bragging about how he founded it.
[01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:32.270]  That's the reality.
[01:34:38.571 --> 01:34:41.412]  And no, this only proves we're right again.
[01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:46.511]  They got some guy they arrest with a bomb after the plane.
[01:34:47.291 --> 01:34:50.092]  The FBI's there trying to impeach his testimony.
[01:34:50.112 --> 01:34:56.295]  You got other witnesses from the same aircraft reporting that there's a guy filming the whole time.
[01:35:00.056 --> 01:35:03.477]  First reported by News Radio 620, WTJM.
[01:35:05.538 --> 01:35:08.960]  He sat up and videotaped the entire thing very calmly, said Patricia.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.761]  We do know that the FBI is looking for him intensely.
[01:35:12.261 --> 01:35:12.701]  Yeah, right.
[01:35:14.878 --> 01:35:19.781]  Her daughter said ahead of them was a man who videotaped the entire flight, including the attempted detonation.
[01:35:22.443 --> 01:35:24.944]  Right as they're hyping wanting to go into Sudan.
[01:35:26.565 --> 01:35:29.247]  Right as they're hyping wanting to go into Yemen.
[01:35:29.587 --> 01:35:36.472]  Right as the news, both BBC and the New York Times,
[01:35:38.672 --> 01:35:44.534]  reported the day before this happened that the new war was Yemen.
[01:35:44.574 --> 01:35:45.734]  Give me a close shot on this.
[01:35:46.754 --> 01:35:48.415]  Yemen, new frontier in U.S.
[01:35:48.435 --> 01:35:49.115]  war on terror.
[01:35:49.435 --> 01:35:50.035]  December 24th.
[01:35:50.295 --> 01:35:55.056]  That's BBC.
[01:35:57.577 --> 01:35:59.498]  Here's New York Times, December 24th.
[01:35:59.678 --> 01:36:02.418]  Hundreds of these articles in the last two weeks before this.
[01:36:02.999 --> 01:36:05.079]  Battle against Al Qaeda stepped up in Yemen.
[01:36:05.779 --> 01:36:06.580]  Thousands of U.S.
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:07.700]  Special Forces there.
[01:36:08.749 --> 01:36:10.130]  Full scale deal going on.
[01:36:15.994 --> 01:36:21.598]  Now again, the FBI... You know what?
[01:36:21.718 --> 01:36:26.101]  I'm not going to say anything that Haskell told me that was off air.
[01:36:27.582 --> 01:36:31.705]  Only two things he asked me not to talk about, and I'm not going to talk about those things he told me.
[01:36:31.745 --> 01:36:33.106]  I'm not going to say anything else he told me.
[01:36:33.466 --> 01:36:34.267]  I'm just going to shut up.
[01:36:35.384 --> 01:36:36.405]  Till he's back on the show.
[01:36:37.145 --> 01:36:38.967]  That's the torture of this job, though, man.
[01:36:38.987 --> 01:36:47.013]  I mean, you get a high-level person over the Department of Cemeteries in New York State.
[01:36:48.334 --> 01:36:49.715]  That's a big department in any state.
[01:36:51.056 --> 01:37:04.686]  And they give you secret documents about how the government's getting ready for a mass flu die-off, and I get this three months before they start the flu hype, and I just say, I don't know if this is really going to happen, but the feds are telling
[01:37:05.919 --> 01:37:10.741]  The Bureau of Prisons in New York that there's going to be a massive flu in 2009, 2010.
[01:37:10.901 --> 01:37:12.722]  It's going to kill millions.
[01:37:13.082 --> 01:37:14.742]  Get ready for millions dead in New York.
[01:37:15.423 --> 01:37:23.826]  Then I get an emergency manager from Indiana bordering a Chicago county saying the same thing.
[01:37:23.846 --> 01:37:31.489]  And I've got to have one of the biggest eyewitnesses out there load all this info on me and I can't tell you about it.
[01:37:34.908 --> 01:37:37.530]  I've got an instant headache, just instant headache here.
[01:37:38.351 --> 01:37:40.413]  I'm literally doing hundreds of investigations at once.
[01:37:40.453 --> 01:37:41.253]  I'm not complaining.
[01:37:42.875 --> 01:37:51.882]  And then I gotta watch shniveling establishment people, like this Michael Shermer, 9-11 truthers foiled by 1225 attack.
[01:37:53.163 --> 01:37:54.064]  We're foiled!
[01:37:55.185 --> 01:37:56.706]  Some simplistic thing about
[01:38:00.322 --> 01:38:06.728]  Because Al-Qaeda is releasing on Israeli fake intel sites responsibility.
[01:38:08.269 --> 01:38:19.439]  And Intel Center, run by the CIA publicly, puts out fake videos with their logo in the same layer as the grandson of the former head of the ADL, Adam Gadon.
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:24.744]  Israeli agents are the head of Al-Qaeda on TV?
[01:38:24.784 --> 01:38:25.985]  The public doesn't know that!
[01:38:27.383 --> 01:38:30.704]  They can verify that in five minutes, they don't want to know the truth.
[01:38:34.186 --> 01:38:36.747]  That is certain pockets of the population.
[01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:47.831]  Oh look, somebody on a message board calling themselves Al Qaeda took credit for this.
[01:38:49.852 --> 01:38:51.113]  And I'm sure the FBI will.
[01:38:52.915 --> 01:38:55.077]  Find some idiots who will carry out terror attacks.
[01:38:55.318 --> 01:38:57.300]  Should we give up all our rights, all our liberties?
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.883]  I mean, have you read the Homeland Security documents?
[01:38:59.923 --> 01:39:01.224]  Have you read the MIAC documents?
[01:39:01.765 --> 01:39:04.528]  The whole Homeland Security system is for Americans.
[01:39:05.008 --> 01:39:10.835]  Conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans, gun owners, and true anti-war liberals.
[01:39:12.558 --> 01:39:12.898]  I.e.
[01:39:13.039 --> 01:39:14.720]  any independent American.
[01:39:15.341 --> 01:39:17.602]  The whole system's for you.
[01:39:17.623 --> 01:39:19.664]  It surveils you.
[01:39:20.365 --> 01:39:23.628]  It has nothing to do with little brown people.
[01:39:27.911 --> 01:39:28.672]  Do you got that?
[01:39:30.374 --> 01:39:35.718]  The New World Order is worried about the last country they haven't disarmed, that they haven't fully bankrupted and run yet.
[01:39:36.319 --> 01:39:37.900]  They've taken over everywhere else.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.441]  They want the U.S.
[01:39:40.512 --> 01:39:42.313]  The big fat engine of tyranny.
[01:39:43.153 --> 01:39:44.253]  Under full control!
[01:39:53.676 --> 01:39:54.596]  Continuing here.
[01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:56.756]  Here's time.
[01:39:56.837 --> 01:39:58.717]  Yemen, Al Qaeda's new training ground.
[01:39:58.777 --> 01:39:59.297]  Oh my gosh.
[01:39:59.657 --> 01:40:00.678]  We've got to attack them.
[01:40:01.278 --> 01:40:02.178]  Everything's a hoax.
[01:40:02.698 --> 01:40:03.758]  It's like the health care bill.
[01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:05.359]  Now the Democrats have actually read it.
[01:40:05.639 --> 01:40:08.100]  It cuts everybody's health care and increases taxes.
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.140]  Gonna pass.
[01:40:10.356 --> 01:40:17.061]  The banker bailout, unlimited trillions, secretly going to banks, not to get the economy going, no one gets in trouble.
[01:40:17.841 --> 01:40:18.602]  Everything's fake.
[01:40:18.782 --> 01:40:19.602]  Everything's a hoax.
[01:40:19.963 --> 01:40:20.883]  Everything's a fraud.
[01:40:21.123 --> 01:40:26.207]  We have a criminal government that's committed so many crimes, why shouldn't they commit a million more?
[01:40:28.171 --> 01:40:30.793]  You've got this guy on a terror watch list allowed on.
[01:40:31.054 --> 01:40:33.075]  You've got the FBI protecting this guy.
[01:40:33.095 --> 01:40:36.498]  You've got the guy's dad going and saying, my son's hooked up with something bad.
[01:40:36.979 --> 01:40:42.764]  You've got this guy living in million-dollar apartments, and he shows up disheveled with some handler.
[01:40:45.446 --> 01:40:47.888]  Witnesses say he looked like he was drugged out of his mind.
[01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:55.275]  Here's some other witnesses from the airplane, on the same show that Mr. and Mrs. Haskell were on, talking about the guy filming the entire flight.
[01:40:56.872 --> 01:40:58.276]  The government doesn't want to talk to them.
[01:40:58.296 --> 01:41:01.002]  You got that queued up?
[01:41:01.503 --> 01:41:01.864]  Here it is.
[01:41:05.339 --> 01:41:07.241]  Yeah, that was very strange.
[01:41:07.301 --> 01:41:13.026]  There was a man that when we first took off, I noticed about 10 seats ahead of us to the left-hand side.
[01:41:13.727 --> 01:41:17.390]  He had a camcorder and I didn't think much of it.
[01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:20.313]  I thought maybe this was his first flight and was just excited.
[01:41:20.453 --> 01:41:27.800]  And then when the actual incident occurred, I looked up and he was the only one standing and filming the entire thing.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:30.340]  Interesting.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.221]  There's obviously still so much more to come out about this.
[01:41:32.241 --> 01:41:34.983]  We really appreciate you joining us, Kurt and Lori Haskell.
[01:41:35.303 --> 01:41:42.428]  And in her full testimony, that's another witness on with the Haskells.
[01:41:42.448 --> 01:41:43.208]  That's not the Haskells.
[01:41:43.248 --> 01:41:46.130]  In fact, I want to get her on if we can for the feds to tell them to shut up.
[01:41:49.932 --> 01:41:52.214]  In the full interviews they've given on radio stations,
[01:41:55.882 --> 01:42:00.663]  Like the radio station source I mentioned earlier, let me be exact about that, 620.
[01:42:01.623 --> 01:42:03.143]  She said, yeah, the whole flight he was taping.
[01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.123]  We kept wondering why.
[01:42:06.324 --> 01:42:08.184]  Why aren't you seeing that video on the news?
[01:42:08.204 --> 01:42:12.365]  You're seeing a cop photo after the cops came on when the plane landed.
[01:42:12.905 --> 01:42:15.525]  Everybody's saying, well, that must be the footage with the police arresting him.
[01:42:15.585 --> 01:42:21.026]  No, there weren't a bunch of uniformed Detroit airport police on the plane.
[01:42:22.067 --> 01:42:24.367]  The citizens got him, tied him up,
[01:42:25.896 --> 01:42:28.478]  Strip-searched him to make sure he didn't have any more bombs.
[01:42:31.699 --> 01:42:32.920]  And that's a police photo.
[01:42:34.241 --> 01:42:37.443]  Why aren't the police releasing the footage?
[01:42:37.463 --> 01:42:39.644]  Because they haven't computer-morphed it yet.
[01:42:41.385 --> 01:42:45.248]  Why haven't they released the footage of the smart-dressed man at all those airport
[01:42:46.038 --> 01:42:47.419]  Video cameras from Amsterdam.
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.763]  Why haven't they released the footage from the man on the flight?
[01:42:52.184 --> 01:42:54.746]  Or if they don't have it, why didn't the man on the flight give it to him?
[01:42:55.106 --> 01:42:57.188]  Was he the handler of this guy?
[01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.889]  Don't worry.
[01:43:00.211 --> 01:43:01.672]  Don't worry, underwear bomber.
[01:43:01.752 --> 01:43:02.993]  I will be here videotaping.
[01:43:03.033 --> 01:43:04.174]  Security brought you on.
[01:43:04.575 --> 01:43:05.355]  You go ahead.
[01:43:05.395 --> 01:43:06.136]  You're doing this.
[01:43:06.556 --> 01:43:09.339]  You're going to be a full agent once you've carried out this drill.
[01:43:11.257 --> 01:43:12.258]  Continue with the drill?
[01:43:12.398 --> 01:43:14.579]  When they come on, you tell them it's part of a drill.
[01:43:15.099 --> 01:43:16.260]  This is how they do it.
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:23.083]  And for any of you fools working for the government, if they ever want you to do something you think is illegal during a drill, this is how they do it.
[01:43:27.346 --> 01:43:28.726]  This is how they set people up.
[01:43:30.327 --> 01:43:31.488]  This is how they operate.
[01:43:31.528 --> 01:43:35.090]  This is what they do over and over and over and over again.
[01:43:38.444 --> 01:43:41.205]  Meanwhile, we're not even talking about government takeover of healthcare.
[01:43:45.367 --> 01:43:46.828]  One-fifth of the U.S.
[01:43:46.868 --> 01:43:47.368]  economy.
[01:43:49.169 --> 01:43:50.910]  One-sixth, depending on how you slice it.
[01:43:52.711 --> 01:43:53.872]  What's left of the economy.
[01:43:54.432 --> 01:43:56.093]  Openly written by the insurance companies.
[01:43:56.273 --> 01:43:57.113]  Openly a scam.
[01:43:59.194 --> 01:43:59.815]  On record!
[01:44:03.416 --> 01:44:06.258]  Maybe Skeptics Magazine will write an article about how I'm imagining that.
[01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:11.354]  Maybe it doesn't have $41 million cut for Medicare and Medicaid, even though the bill says it.
[01:44:11.835 --> 01:44:13.957]  We'll just have someone say, oh, everything's fine.
[01:44:14.297 --> 01:44:15.038]  I'm an expert.
[01:44:15.138 --> 01:44:16.219]  I'm the anointed one.
[01:44:16.579 --> 01:44:17.780]  I say none of it's real.
[01:44:18.661 --> 01:44:21.003]  I say you can trust the government and the media.
[01:44:21.964 --> 01:44:26.389]  I say anyone that says government's too big or out of control, they're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:44:26.749 --> 01:44:28.671]  You can now be lazy and go back to sleep.
[01:44:30.693 --> 01:44:31.554]  Let's go to Wayne.
[01:44:34.662 --> 01:44:35.362]  Or WAV.
[01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:37.423]  I gotta get this monitor closer to me.
[01:44:38.124 --> 01:44:39.404]  WAVE in Connecticut.
[01:44:39.424 --> 01:44:39.965]  You're on the air.
[01:44:40.025 --> 01:44:42.466]  Go ahead.
[01:44:42.826 --> 01:44:46.848]  Anyway, yeah, I just started listening to you about four months ago.
[01:44:47.468 --> 01:44:50.690]  And I just want to tell you, Alex, don't be frustrated by these naysayers.
[01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:52.711]  And I mean, you're doing a good thing.
[01:44:53.131 --> 01:45:00.154]  And I just want to tell you, my sister-in-law, who is my brother's second wife, doesn't know me very well.
[01:45:00.194 --> 01:45:02.235]  But she said, who is this Alex Jones?
[01:45:02.255 --> 01:45:03.676]  So I played her a clip of you at the
[01:45:04.597 --> 01:45:05.157]  Absolutely!
[01:45:05.457 --> 01:45:08.639]  And look, look, if you hadn't been there doing what you're doing, Wave,
[01:45:34.091 --> 01:45:35.312]  We'd be in a lot worse trouble.
[01:45:35.332 --> 01:45:39.514]  Do you have any comments about all the news here or how CNN has a fake poll?
[01:45:40.214 --> 01:45:44.096]  Oh, 73% are ready for the full body scan.
[01:45:44.117 --> 01:45:44.977]  Show them the quick vote.
[01:45:45.337 --> 01:45:45.897]  Quick vote!
[01:45:46.238 --> 01:45:47.658]  Which means they can fix the quick vote.
[01:45:47.959 --> 01:45:50.400]  Would you be willing to undergo an airport full body scan?
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.922]  The vast majority of Americans in polls I've seen were against these.
[01:45:54.322 --> 01:45:55.383]  Now they love them.
[01:45:55.783 --> 01:45:58.864]  Save me from the Nigerian underwear bomber!
[01:45:59.445 --> 01:46:00.185]  Help me!
[01:46:00.585 --> 01:46:01.746]  Wave, I appreciate your call.
[01:46:01.806 --> 01:46:03.127]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.750]  Hello, Alex.
[01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:06.251]  How are you, sir?
[01:46:07.031 --> 01:46:10.394]  Well, I'm just scared to death of a Nigerian firecracker bomber.
[01:46:10.714 --> 01:46:15.758]  I better give up all my rights to foreign banks and have secret police violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:46:16.298 --> 01:46:17.879]  The government's going to save me.
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.481]  That's how I'm doing, Joe.
[01:46:19.821 --> 01:46:21.202]  Thank God for the bankers.
[01:46:21.542 --> 01:46:23.864]  Thank God they used that TARP money to rob us.
[01:46:24.004 --> 01:46:24.684]  Oh, thank you.
[01:46:24.704 --> 01:46:31.630]  Alex, I just had to appreciate you, and I just had two questions.
[01:46:32.677 --> 01:46:42.821]  One was directed towards when you had Mr. Lenton regarding, do you think that they're going to try to slip some cap and trade into this health bill?
[01:46:43.321 --> 01:46:50.344]  And the second one was regarding Mr. Haskell, and you brought up a key point about the airport in Amsterdam.
[01:46:50.684 --> 01:46:56.546]  Just how many, you know, people of Indian descent or African descent
[01:46:57.530 --> 01:47:02.435]  Uh, we're in that airport and or on that plane with Mr. and Ms.
[01:47:02.455 --> 01:47:02.956]  Haskell.
[01:47:03.677 --> 01:47:06.359]  And, uh, I'm just listening to your comments and I appreciate you.
[01:47:06.379 --> 01:47:09.062]  And I'm getting your DVDs out as fast as I can.
[01:47:09.442 --> 01:47:10.083]  God bless you.
[01:47:10.103 --> 01:47:10.703]  Don't stop.
[01:47:11.104 --> 01:47:16.689]  The power of you, the listeners, getting the Obama Deception in game, fall of the Republic, and giving it to people.
[01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:19.012]  The public is now ready to wake up.
[01:47:20.063 --> 01:47:23.305]  We've done incredible work together previously.
[01:47:23.445 --> 01:47:25.486]  Now is the season.
[01:47:25.927 --> 01:47:28.228]  Now is when the mighty crops are coming in.
[01:47:28.689 --> 01:47:33.352]  Every time we throw our nets in, the ships almost sink and there's so many fish in the nets.
[01:47:34.492 --> 01:47:36.634]  People are like, oh, they're announcing world government.
[01:47:36.974 --> 01:47:37.894]  There's nothing we can do.
[01:47:38.075 --> 01:47:38.715]  Baloney!
[01:47:39.856 --> 01:47:41.617]  Now the enemies come out in the open.
[01:47:43.331 --> 01:47:47.757]  I would guess there's a lot of Africans, a lot of Arabs coming through Amsterdam.
[01:47:47.777 --> 01:47:52.003]  That's a major African Middle Eastern hub into Europe and the rest of the world.
[01:47:53.831 --> 01:47:57.134]  There's a billion Indians, they're everywhere, so I don't know.
[01:47:57.254 --> 01:48:07.164]  But the bigger question is, why aren't we seeing the video from the plane and in the concourse and in the airport out?
[01:48:07.524 --> 01:48:13.830]  And what they'll do, what I predict in the next few weeks, if we make a big enough stink, if not it'll be six months from now, they'll release some side shot.
[01:48:16.212 --> 01:48:16.513]  Yeah.
[01:48:46.112 --> 01:48:46.993]  I'll take their rights.
[01:48:47.333 --> 01:48:48.294]  Oh, thank you, Obama.
[01:48:48.694 --> 01:48:53.318]  Right now it's about a smoke screen to cover up the passage of health care coming up next week.
[01:48:55.299 --> 01:48:56.880]  So people don't look what's in the bill.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.361]  Or the Democrat revolt.
[01:48:58.741 --> 01:49:01.864]  Or, what, two Democrats stepping down, leaving their parties?
[01:49:03.792 --> 01:49:08.596]  And total revolt from the left against the health care bill because they found out it's not a goody.
[01:49:09.116 --> 01:49:13.240]  You think the bankers are going to rob other people to give you something free?
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.566]  If they're going to rob people with your immoral wealth redistribution, they're going to keep it for them.
[01:49:19.586 --> 01:49:21.187]  Because who took over America?
[01:49:21.487 --> 01:49:22.729]  Who set up the police state?
[01:49:23.009 --> 01:49:23.469]  They did.
[01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:25.071]  You don't get nothing!
[01:49:26.632 --> 01:49:28.534]  Oh, you thought you were going to get a little bit of the honey.
[01:49:30.307 --> 01:49:30.827]  No, no, no.
[01:49:30.887 --> 01:49:33.089]  That domestication process is over.
[01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:35.410]  They've broken up the American family.
[01:49:35.610 --> 01:49:36.831]  They've screwed up the country.
[01:49:37.091 --> 01:49:38.612]  They've gotten enough people dependent.
[01:49:38.892 --> 01:49:46.277]  You're going to get just enough chicken feed, enough hog feed, to serve your masters and nothing more.
[01:49:46.837 --> 01:49:48.538]  And you're going to get your rations cut!
[01:49:49.879 --> 01:49:51.760]  Because now is the time of bondage.
[01:49:53.741 --> 01:49:56.983]  So you thought you were going to get a little bit of goody there on the side.
[01:49:57.123 --> 01:49:58.224]  You're getting nothing.
[01:49:58.899 --> 01:50:01.842]  You're gonna get less of what you were getting and you're gonna like it!
[01:50:03.523 --> 01:50:07.827]  And the bankers are gonna take everybody's pension funds and just incrementally rape everyone.
[01:50:08.428 --> 01:50:09.929]  And you try to go out and protest?
[01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:18.838]  The cops will come right up, throw a rocket themselves, and then open fire with rubber bullets and sound cannons on you and run up with billy clubs and just...
[01:50:20.819 --> 01:50:23.801]  Right into old ladies' heads, watching teeth and blood spew.
[01:50:23.821 --> 01:50:36.290]  They'll high-five the death of America, and they'll drink their fluoride and give their babies all the aspartame and shots, and their kids will have convulsions, and the cops will go, God, I love government!
[01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:37.852]  I love how they hurt me, too!
[01:50:38.412 --> 01:50:41.434]  As long as I can beat up old ladies, I feel good!
[01:50:41.694 --> 01:50:43.136]  Poison me, New World Order!
[01:50:43.496 --> 01:50:44.356]  I love you!
[01:50:45.237 --> 01:50:45.917]  Thank you!
[01:50:45.937 --> 01:50:49.698]  I'm a low-level psychopath who loves the bigger psychopaths!
[01:50:53.879 --> 01:50:55.159]  Remain in your houses.
[01:50:55.919 --> 01:50:59.780]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.700]  Will they do it?
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:05.000]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:51:05.641 --> 01:51:11.682]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:51:12.102 --> 01:51:13.362]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:51:14.302 --> 01:51:17.824]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:51:18.585 --> 01:51:22.867]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:51:23.468 --> 01:51:27.730]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:51:28.371 --> 01:51:33.194]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:51:34.114 --> 01:51:42.257]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:51:42.537 --> 01:51:44.817]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:51:45.038 --> 01:51:47.918]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[01:51:48.099 --> 01:51:51.039]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:57.061]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:51:57.441 --> 01:52:00.482]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:00.702 --> 01:52:02.083]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:52:02.808 --> 01:52:05.491]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:05.511 --> 01:52:11.696]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:11.876 --> 01:52:16.921]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:17.421 --> 01:52:27.070]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:27.170 --> 01:52:29.271]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:29.511 --> 01:52:30.852]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:31.112 --> 01:52:33.373]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:33.573 --> 01:52:35.413]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:35.674 --> 01:52:40.496]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:40.836 --> 01:52:45.598]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:52:52.014 --> 01:52:57.459]  When the electricity goes out, how will you boil water, cook dinner, light your home, or get news reports?
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:02.925]  Most families are not prepared for even the shortest power outage due to hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms, and so on.
[01:53:03.025 --> 01:53:08.531]  But you can prepare your family for emergencies and not spend a lot doing it with the amazing products from Carroll Stove.

[01:53:52.615 --> 01:53:56.215]  Oh Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[01:53:57.096 --> 01:53:58.216]  Oh Lordy,
[01:53:59.899 --> 01:54:12.530]  Well obviously that was some breaking bombshell news from one of the key eyewitnesses of how they let them take their own baggage off to get their operatives off in case something went bad.
[01:54:12.971 --> 01:54:14.592]  How they found somebody else with a bomb.
[01:54:14.632 --> 01:54:17.575]  That was them taking one of their agents out who got caught up in the search.
[01:54:18.911 --> 01:54:20.132]  If it fits, classic M.O.
[01:54:20.693 --> 01:54:23.316]  You know, with the shoe bomber and everybody else security leads them on.
[01:54:23.556 --> 01:54:24.778]  Oh, this is a special person.
[01:54:24.818 --> 01:54:27.280]  It's always some drugged out freak all wild.
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:28.822]  That's why they've got to be led on.
[01:54:28.842 --> 01:54:31.365]  Because they're always drugged out or mentally ill.
[01:54:31.385 --> 01:54:35.169]  Literally just, ugh, ugh, you know, being brought onto the plane.
[01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:37.692]  These patsies, man, never end.
[01:54:39.633 --> 01:54:41.094]  Pull up the shoe bomber's image.
[01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:45.797]  I mean, just out of his gourd, couldn't keep a job, couldn't tie his shoelaces.
[01:54:46.178 --> 01:54:50.541]  But he's the ace deadly Al-Qaeda, the reason freedom had to end in the world.
[01:54:50.981 --> 01:54:56.905]  Don't worry, black ski mask anti-terror cop is here to take your farm and ranch and your children.
[01:54:57.265 --> 01:55:01.048]  Oh, sorry, there's no Al-Qaeda, but there is American gun owner.
[01:55:01.929 --> 01:55:03.089]  I mean, look at that moron.
[01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:06.512]  That guy's got about five brain cells he can rub together if he's lucky.
[01:55:08.803 --> 01:55:12.687]  I mean, I've seen cockroaches with more intelligence in their eyes.
[01:55:12.707 --> 01:55:17.392]  A little bit like Sylvester Stallone on the lobotomy.
[01:55:17.912 --> 01:55:19.734]  But I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:20.315 --> 01:55:21.556]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:55:22.637 --> 01:55:24.559]  Gerald Salente's coming up in the retransmission.
[01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:26.661]  I'm out of time for all these callers.
[01:55:26.681 --> 01:55:28.563]  I'm going to try to have more open phones the next few days.
[01:55:28.583 --> 01:55:29.504]  I've got a bunch of other guests.
[01:55:29.524 --> 01:55:30.645]  We'll continue to track all this.
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:31.840]  I think?
[01:55:52.625 --> 01:55:55.971]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:55:56.011 --> 01:55:58.396]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com.
[01:55:58.516 --> 01:55:58.897]  One word.
[01:55:59.177 --> 01:56:03.405]  Because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:56:03.906 --> 01:56:04.848]  This is a great little unit.
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:08.641]  Plug and play solar generators are now available from Solutions for Science.
[01:56:09.021 --> 01:56:10.642]  They've been available for two years.
[01:56:10.742 --> 01:56:11.962]  Our listeners have told us they're good.
[01:56:12.342 --> 01:56:20.885]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current whenever and wherever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun, storing it in the battery system.
[01:56:21.365 --> 01:56:24.566]  Unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly and emits no fumes.
[01:56:25.947 --> 01:56:31.389]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power allergies again.
[01:56:31.409 --> 01:56:35.310]  You should go to MySolarBackup.com to request a free information package today.
[01:56:35.610 --> 01:56:37.870]  That's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:40.331]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:56:41.691 --> 01:56:43.932]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:56:45.132 --> 01:56:48.653]  And one other great sponsor is Diginet Personal Audio Video Recorders.
[01:56:48.693 --> 01:56:51.694]  They got hidden pins, they got sunglasses all in one piece.
[01:56:52.194 --> 01:56:54.035]  You talk about a great hidden system.
[01:56:54.983 --> 01:56:57.364]  To protect yourself from Big Brother or expose corruption.
[01:56:57.864 --> 01:57:04.446]  Everyone needs the systems they have at Diginet.net and they've got the best prices I've seen as one of the biggest dealers out there and they're patriots.
[01:57:04.846 --> 01:57:06.087]  Diginet.net.
[01:57:06.147 --> 01:57:09.148]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:57:10.425 --> 01:57:13.509]  And, uh, this unit is a video and recording device.
[01:57:13.529 --> 01:57:16.853]  That's their pin, disguised as a pin, and it fits right into your pocket.
[01:57:17.113 --> 01:57:18.775]  Again, I like the sunglasses, everything else.
[01:57:19.075 --> 01:57:23.120]  That's Diginet.net, or get their phone number off the website.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.703]  Diginet.net.
[01:57:27.325 --> 01:57:30.448]  And, uh, one last little sponsor, and I'll give you a heads up on what's coming up tomorrow.
[01:57:31.468 --> 01:57:34.970]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:37.192]  Well, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[01:57:37.212 --> 01:57:41.595]  Our sponsor, Ecolablue, with the Ecolablue 28, will allow you to do just that.
[01:57:41.995 --> 01:57:45.537]  It's easy to use, and it will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[01:57:45.938 --> 01:57:54.123]  The water, once generated, passes through a seven-stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis, carbon filtration techniques, ensuring that you know exactly what you're drinking.
[01:57:54.163 --> 01:57:55.584]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[01:57:55.924 --> 01:57:56.965]  They've got their new Ecolablue
[01:57:57.125 --> 01:57:58.766]  We've got Webster Tarpley coming up, Alan Watt coming up.
[01:58:24.177 --> 01:58:27.942]  We've got, for a full hour, Wayne Madsen coming up.
[01:58:28.282 --> 01:58:29.183]  Big show tomorrow.
[01:58:29.423 --> 01:58:30.124]  Don't want to miss it.
[01:58:30.144 --> 01:58:30.845]  God bless you all.
[01:58:30.885 --> 01:58:31.526]  Great job, crew.
