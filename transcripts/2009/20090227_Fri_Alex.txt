[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.232]  E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:00:49.063 --> 00:00:49.743]  Big Brother.

[00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:53.285]  Government cover-ups.

[00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.611]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:05.292]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:15.677]  We have begun simulcasting an hour early today, live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:19.678]  Bob Chapman with his Friday visit is with us for the full hour.
[00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:23.000]  We're going to break down the huge developments in the markets
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.107]  Right now, Citibank's shares are down by 36% and plunging as we speak.
[00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:32.910]  Clearly done by design by the central banks.
[00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:39.998]  Even mainstream media admits that by bad-mouthing and talking about nationalizing, it's driving down Bank of America and Citibank.
[00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.402]  The private Federal Reserve is using the government envelope or glove and calling it nationalization.
[00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:50.184]  It's really financial domination, financial hijacking.
[00:01:50.524 --> 00:01:51.145]  We'll get into that.
[00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:58.109]  We'll get into all the latest economic numbers that just came out today, like a record plunge in the overall economy of 26%.
[00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.832]  We'll break all that down with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com right now.
[00:02:04.112 --> 00:02:05.373]  Bob, thank you for joining us.
[00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:09.135]  Well, you're welcome, and it's very nice to be here.
[00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:12.236]  Let's get right into it.
[00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:14.537]  What do you think is most important happening in the economy right now?
[00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:38.941]  Well, the episode that you just talked about, which is ongoing, Citigroup and its machinations, the reason they don't want nationalization is that in nationalization, the people who own stock in the company lose out in totality.
[00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:40.983]  That's number one.
[00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:48.629]  Number two, the bondholders get wiped out or they get a piece of what's left, but there may not be much left.
[00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:55.854]  Number three, it exposes the tremendous amount of derivatives that Citigroup is involved in.
[00:02:56.315 --> 00:03:04.201]  It kills all of the bonuses, all of these extra golden parachutes and all those kinds of things that the management has.
[00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:09.265]  So rather than do that, nationalize, they privatize.
[00:03:09.838 --> 00:03:18.422]  As you brought up in the program before, and it's a consolidation of the major banks who make up a good part of the business in the United States.
[00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:28.407]  And in privatizing, they're able to better control the movement of finance in the United States.
[00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:31.849]  And so these are the main things.
[00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.732]  And of course, unfortunately for the shareholders,
[00:03:38.524 --> 00:03:44.669]  It's been an absolute nosedive.
[00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.711]  We went short the stock.
[00:03:49.052 --> 00:03:55.698]  We bet it was going to go down at $38 a share, $42 a share, somewhere up there.
[00:03:56.098 --> 00:04:03.324]  I kind of get it mixed up with JP Morgan because we shorted that as well, around the same price, and that's selling for around $20.
[00:04:03.884 --> 00:04:05.025]  But as you pointed out,
[00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:09.576]  Uh, the Citigroup, uh, is down 56 cents today.
[00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:13.417]  It's selling for about a buck and a half, and we'll probably cover that short.
[00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:17.277]  In other words, buy it in at somewhere around a dollar, I hope.
[00:04:18.078 --> 00:04:29.200]  And, uh, the, uh, subscribers, uh, will have, uh, made the difference between, say, $40 and $1, which is an awful lot of money.
[00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:33.617]  Well, you're absolutely right, Bob.
[00:04:34.298 --> 00:04:39.261]  Specifically, let's start going over, after the break, we have a long segment, the economic numbers.
[00:04:40.202 --> 00:04:48.087]  The economy, they're reporting, is contracting at a record pace right now, and I want to break down
[00:04:49.648 --> 00:04:56.430]  China saying they may not continue to buy as much of the T-bills, and where you see the globalists.
[00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.652]  Week to week so much happens now, it's like a year has passed in what would normally transpire in financial times.
[00:05:04.212 --> 00:05:11.834]  And then I also want to early on go to phone calls for listeners specifically that have questions for you about the market.
[00:05:11.854 --> 00:05:12.854]  And then we'll talk about gold.
[00:05:13.214 --> 00:05:15.194]  Up above a thousand, then down to...
[00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:19.897]  You know, below 950, now racing back up.
[00:05:20.557 --> 00:05:27.082]  You predicted it would race above 1,000, then go back down, and then find its bottom, and then go up way past 1,000 a month ago.
[00:05:27.402 --> 00:05:33.547]  So we'll see what your predictions are for where it's going to be going now, and the new numbers that it's going to be testing.
[00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:35.928]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:39.991]  We are simulcasting live at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:41.893]  Here on the radio show, stay with us.
[00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:54.935]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:05:55.415 --> 00:05:56.456]  Garden in a Can!

[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.741]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.

[00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:16.432]  Garden in a can.
[00:06:16.852 --> 00:06:17.713]  It's that simple.
[00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:18.353]  Fresh.
[00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:19.154]  Healthy.
[00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:19.914]  Easy.
[00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:24.398]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:50.231]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:52.251]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.266]  But who is the enemy?
[00:06:54.787 --> 00:06:55.307]  Bin Laden.
[00:06:55.587 --> 00:06:56.567]  This is his M.O.
[00:06:56.588 --> 00:06:57.888]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:06:57.948 --> 00:06:59.589]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:06.692]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:07.532]  Some U.S.
[00:07:07.572 --> 00:07:13.235]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:17.458]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:27.667]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:07:27.908 --> 00:07:28.648]  Fabled enemies.

[00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:47.017]  Life Change Tea sets the standard.
[00:07:47.178 --> 00:07:53.843]  Have you heard on radio all the new teas with funny names, movie stars, celebrities endorsing these products and so on?
[00:07:54.244 --> 00:07:55.385]  Have you checked the results?
[00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:59.028]  Not pictures of the bikini babes and such, but the results.
[00:07:59.248 --> 00:08:04.493]  Have you checked their pricing and the funky three-month contracts and all that stuff?
[00:08:04.593 --> 00:08:05.754]  Have you checked their results?
[00:08:06.014 --> 00:08:06.815]  Oh, that's right, I said that.
[00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:09.117]  Did you check the ingredients and did you check for caffeine?
[00:08:09.317 --> 00:08:09.837]  Yeah!
[00:08:10.578 --> 00:08:12.439]  Life Change Tea is the real deal.
[00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:17.063]  Not a new yippee-yi-yay tea, but a tea if you drink it daily, it'll change your life.
[00:08:17.483 --> 00:08:18.764]  And it will clean your body.

[00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.190]  Get the tea at 928-308-0408.
[00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.530]  That's 928-308-0408.

[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.943]  All right, back live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:44.963 --> 00:08:46.364]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.
[00:09:03.348 --> 00:09:06.469]  How are things going for the globalists and their worldwide consolidation?
[00:09:06.489 --> 00:09:11.031]  They're all over the news again this week, saying world government's the answer, world banking.
[00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:13.312]  Obama has announced his carbon taxes.
[00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:16.373]  They've now got a flotilla of mainstream news articles.
[00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:20.535]  You can just Google, put a carbon tax on children, that's really the one-child policy.
[00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:22.376]  They're racing ahead.
[00:09:22.476 --> 00:09:25.937]  Now Obama's announcing scores of new taxes, not just people making $125,000.
[00:09:28.058 --> 00:09:29.900]  I think you're right, particularly on the taxation issue.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.662]  Of course, the money that they've been spending is atrocious.
[00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:07.215]  Even the Obama Administration said that they were going to have a deficit of $1.75 trillion.
[00:10:08.075 --> 00:10:10.597]  And there's other estimates that are close to $2 trillion.
[00:10:11.217 --> 00:10:14.759]  And so, you know, we've been right on on our guesstimates.
[00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:17.060]  Actually, ours started at $1.3 trillion.
[00:10:17.781 --> 00:10:21.863]  And then we get into it deeper and it's like going through a garbage dump.
[00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:25.625]  And it just keeps on getting worse.
[00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:45.363]  What's going on in the markets here is great indecision because I don't think Wall Street and professional investors quite envisioned the changes that are taking place to be the kind of changes that they anticipated.
[00:10:46.063 --> 00:10:47.624]  And so they didn't happen.
[00:10:48.244 --> 00:10:49.124]  Worse things did.
[00:10:49.144 --> 00:10:57.206]  You know, higher taxes, particularly if they put taxes on share transactions, which they've talked about as well.
[00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:01.556]  Is not very good for Wall Street.
[00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:08.619]  The earnings are going to probably come in on the S&P 500 about $28.
[00:11:09.479 --> 00:11:16.761]  And that would reflect into the Dow Jones Industrial selling around $6,000.
[00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:22.083]  So I'm looking at $6,000 to $6,600, somewhere down in there.
[00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:27.465]  And the market has no real strength every time it tries to
[00:11:28.415 --> 00:11:30.517]  Put a rally on it, cut short.
[00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:34.619]  The same thing happened again today, and it's in progress.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.864]  As far as the gold is concerned, we've had a very quick recruitment this week.
[00:11:42.404 --> 00:11:49.048]  It swung down through the $9.30 area, which was about a $70 adjustment over four days.
[00:11:49.609 --> 00:11:54.772]  And actually, you know, for you people who haven't been in the market for years like I have,
[00:11:55.253 --> 00:11:59.614]  When you have adjustments like that, and they're quick like that, they're very, very good.
[00:12:00.215 --> 00:12:06.017]  Now, I know an adjustment isn't good, but if you're going to have one, that's the best kind to have when it happens quick.
[00:12:06.897 --> 00:12:07.737]  And it happened quick.
[00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:09.438]  The question is, is this the bottom?
[00:12:10.578 --> 00:12:11.618]  It could be $900.
[00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:12.839]  It could be here.
[00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:14.799]  Don't know for sure.
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.780]  And it'll turn around and go right back up again and test $1000.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.522]  I think it should happen immediately.
[00:12:23.015 --> 00:12:23.955]  Or fairly quickly.
[00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:26.456]  If it doesn't, it'll certainly happen by the fall.
[00:12:27.236 --> 00:12:29.477]  And so, gold is going to break out.
[00:12:30.257 --> 00:12:32.057]  And the insiders know that.
[00:12:33.077 --> 00:12:35.178]  They're just trying to delay it as long as possible.
[00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:43.120]  Just like they are trying to delay what's going on in the market, and in the economy, and in finance.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.561]  And those figures they came up with this morning about GDP falling in the fourth quarter.
[00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:49.761]  What was it?
[00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:49.761]  6.3%.
[00:12:49.821 --> 00:12:51.362]  The figures are even worse than that.
[00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:55.017]  I mean, you know that they never tell the truth.
[00:12:55.077 --> 00:12:57.238]  Now, they're saying biggest drop in 26 years.
[00:12:58.138 --> 00:12:59.039]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:01.880]  And that's going to continue and it's going to get worse.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:11.285]  Now, the feed-in of the monies that are coming from the stimulus package are not really going to make a great deal of difference this year.
[00:13:12.185 --> 00:13:13.086]  It'll help a little.
[00:13:13.546 --> 00:13:22.531]  And that's going to cause the, depending upon whose ratings you look at, on Mr. Obama, one of them is 64, the other is 54.
[00:13:23.898 --> 00:13:27.839]  He's going to be down by September, October, around 40 to 35.
[00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:33.420]  Because people are going to realize that this program is just not going to work that way.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:39.322]  Do you see them staging a terror attack around that time to try to rally support around the messianic leader?
[00:13:39.362 --> 00:13:47.884]  I mean, I don't see them getting their agenda through without them staging a terror attack, releasing a bioweapon to pose as saviors, or launching a new war.
[00:13:47.904 --> 00:13:51.985]  Oh, it's certainly, certainly very possible.
[00:13:52.831 --> 00:14:03.239]  The problem is the timing is so difficult because the, you know, 35 or 40 as a approval rating really isn't bad.
[00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:05.000]  It's not good, but it's not bad.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:12.826]  And I don't know that they would create a false flag operation based upon that.
[00:14:14.527 --> 00:14:20.011]  You know, the most of the money that's in that package is going to be coming out next year.
[00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:21.512]  So next year,
[00:14:22.256 --> 00:14:28.937]  Could be a holding hiatus point and maybe a little bit better than this year.
[00:14:29.978 --> 00:14:39.920]  And the reason for that, the reason I packed it that way is because there's a congressional election next year and all these people who are Democrats want to get reelected.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.541]  So this is why people think things are going to happen quickly.
[00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:47.521]  And there's so many things you have to factor into this thing.
[00:14:48.942 --> 00:14:50.562]  And these people have the ability.
[00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:54.079]  through Congress to do stimulus packages.
[00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:57.961]  In fact, I think they'll have another one next January, probably for $2 trillion.
[00:14:58.381 --> 00:15:05.325]  Well, Obama's already saying another banker bailout, which will be the one that sets up the new global New Deal, the new global bank.
[00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:08.207]  Oh, it's going to help you globally with U.S.
[00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:09.067]  taxpayer money.
[00:15:09.948 --> 00:15:17.312]  Bob, you know, a few weeks ago, you said you were revising your forecast a bit from complete depression within two and a half years to a year and a half.
[00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:25.407]  Like revising back to a more long-term till we're in a Mad Max scenario?
[00:15:26.327 --> 00:15:27.067]  What are you getting at?
[00:15:27.147 --> 00:15:29.768]  Well, we have depression already started.
[00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:36.589]  And we're having a slight hiatus in inflation in the United States.
[00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:37.909]  We're running around 9%.
[00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:44.730]  M3 is running around 11.5% to 12% down from where it was before.
[00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.411]  But as the TARP funds and other funds from stimulus
[00:15:50.051 --> 00:15:56.976]  Hit the market and the responsibility of Treasury to raise two trillion dollars, which they'll have to monetize.
[00:15:57.697 --> 00:16:01.580]  That's going to begin hitting probably in April, maybe May, maybe March.
[00:16:02.321 --> 00:16:06.184]  And that's going to very quickly push inflation up.
[00:16:07.185 --> 00:16:09.146]  And that will extend.
[00:16:09.566 --> 00:16:15.311]  Inflation extends the end line for deflation.
[00:16:16.212 --> 00:16:16.512]  And so
[00:16:17.777 --> 00:16:24.743]  That's why you can't easily predict what's going on, but we're going to have an inflationary depression for a time.
[00:16:25.624 --> 00:16:26.104]  Two years?
[00:16:27.185 --> 00:16:27.805]  Maybe three?
[00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:28.706]  Maybe a year and a half?
[00:16:28.786 --> 00:16:29.447]  I don't know yet.
[00:16:30.191 --> 00:16:31.492]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:39.157]  Let's talk about the credit card bubble, the college bubble, people that have paid for these $100,000 college educations.
[00:16:39.617 --> 00:16:40.978]  They're getting out every year.
[00:16:41.118 --> 00:16:42.279]  They can't find jobs.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.041]  They're accelerating offshoring of U.S.
[00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:49.264]  jobs, accelerating bringing in the skilled visas to replace jobs.
[00:16:49.344 --> 00:16:55.128]  Everybody I know in Austin that worked at IBM, degreed engineers, and I know four people have all lost their jobs completely.
[00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:59.611]  They had to train their end-end replacements who were working for a third of it, and now they're gone.
[00:17:00.431 --> 00:17:00.491]  Yes.
[00:17:17.682 --> 00:17:20.763]  Every time I went to it in the past, it was jam-packed and full on a Thursday night.
[00:17:21.403 --> 00:17:24.083]  There were one other group of people in there eating dinner.
[00:17:24.923 --> 00:17:27.884]  Restaurants, you know, that have always been, you know, really busy.
[00:17:28.044 --> 00:17:30.905]  And Austin's supposedly a good economy.
[00:17:31.365 --> 00:17:33.565]  I mean, this is already bad, what we're under.
[00:17:33.605 --> 00:17:35.306]  I mean, how bad are you saying it's going to get?
[00:17:35.326 --> 00:17:38.226]  Well, over 30% unemployment.
[00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:46.948]  Incidentally, IBM just is in the process of building a major complex south of Guadalajara in Mexico.
[00:17:47.885 --> 00:18:02.045]  And they intend to move everything out of the United States, and that's why the only answer to this problem of free trade, globalization, offshoring, and outsourcing very simply is tariffs.
[00:18:03.066 --> 00:18:04.789]  And if America does not have tariffs,
[00:18:05.262 --> 00:18:07.743]  We'll end up with 40 or 50 percent unemployment.
[00:18:08.163 --> 00:18:10.583]  And for those that don't know... And there's no way we can compete.
[00:18:10.903 --> 00:18:16.785]  And for those that don't know, China has a built-in tariff with their low currency and no environmental standards and slave wages.
[00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:21.546]  That is basically, in its overall economic effect, a huge tariff.
[00:18:21.866 --> 00:18:25.207]  So when we hear free trade, this is not free or fair trade, is it, Bob?
[00:18:26.507 --> 00:18:27.447]  It certainly isn't.
[00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:33.489]  And it is just absolutely propaganda that's been misrepresented
[00:18:34.068 --> 00:18:45.691]  And, sadly, the only newsletter writer I know of who's talking outside the box, who pushes it so hard, the rest of them just don't get it.
[00:18:45.971 --> 00:18:47.832]  Now, you've got to watch them, though, Bob.
[00:18:47.972 --> 00:18:52.613]  They'll pass a tariff the day they finally take the stock market down to nothing and say the tariff did it.
[00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:53.654]  You know the tricks they play.
[00:18:54.374 --> 00:18:54.554]  Yep.
[00:18:54.854 --> 00:18:56.755]  That's what they did in the early 30s.
[00:18:56.875 --> 00:19:01.476]  And the depression was caused in that period of time.
[00:19:02.253 --> 00:19:04.074]  By the Fed withdrawing money for the system.
[00:19:04.774 --> 00:19:08.155]  And then when they turned around and put it back into the system, it wouldn't do any good.
[00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:10.275]  And that's exactly what's happening today.
[00:19:11.135 --> 00:19:14.076]  And you know they know that that's the way it works.
[00:19:14.516 --> 00:19:17.697]  So you know it was delivered just like it is now.
[00:19:17.717 --> 00:19:26.940]  That's why you're hearing what you just mentioned, Alex, about, well, we need a world government, we need a world currency, we need a world this, that, and the other thing.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.801]  That's the justification for that.
[00:19:31.783 --> 00:19:32.904]  Yeah, it's a perfect plan.
[00:19:33.264 --> 00:19:41.048]  They globally create the crisis and say we need a global solution to a global crisis, and then the very people that engineered this by design, they will then be our saviors.
[00:19:41.108 --> 00:19:53.095]  I mean, it seems to me all we've got to do is tell the truth and get the story out about how this is a pack of criminals, larcenous criminals that destroyed our economy by design to build their new world order.
[00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:58.677]  And that we should take the states back, take the federal government back, and arrest all these criminals.
[00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:03.239]  I mean, we can do that if we just start believing we can, and get the word out about it.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.340]  Amen.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:12.183]  Boy, I tell ya, that's why I'm on here, and that's why I'm on 20 programs a week, and I keep it up just like you do.
[00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:16.405]  And believe me, Alex, we are making inroads.
[00:20:17.105 --> 00:20:20.967]  I'm getting letters all the time, not only from Americans who are subscribers,
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.442]  The people all over the world.
[00:20:25.784 --> 00:20:27.466]  Well, you got powerful info, Bob.
[00:20:27.506 --> 00:20:28.887]  You're on target, and that's what matters.
[00:20:28.907 --> 00:20:30.069]  That's why it's great to have you here.
[00:20:30.369 --> 00:20:38.036]  We're gonna come back, get into your phone calls, your questions for Bob Chapman, or myself, or your statements, when we come back.
[00:20:38.056 --> 00:20:38.116]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:38.437]  Stay with us.
[00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:48.951]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[00:20:49.372 --> 00:20:50.753]  You are not alone.
[00:20:51.274 --> 00:20:53.797]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[00:20:54.137 --> 00:20:58.902]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[00:20:59.203 --> 00:21:00.945]  Signs include itching, pulling,
[00:21:01.305 --> 00:21:02.006]  We're good to go!
[00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:21.903]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:21.923 --> 00:21:22.323]  A new world order.
[00:21:22.343 --> 00:21:22.903]  In the near future.
[00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:53.743]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:54.184 --> 00:21:56.966]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:57.026 --> 00:21:59.248]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:21:59.789 --> 00:22:02.251]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:22:02.991 --> 00:22:10.298]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:18.294]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:22:18.775 --> 00:22:22.277]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:22:22.637 --> 00:22:25.119]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:26.360]  Most people have no idea.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.140]  They're not after money.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.241]  They have all the money they need.
[00:22:28.441 --> 00:22:29.162]  They're after power.
[00:22:29.422 --> 00:22:30.282]  That's what happens here.

[00:22:39.288 --> 00:22:39.669]  In Game.
[00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:41.670]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.131]  You have been warned.
[00:22:44.872 --> 00:22:48.715]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:48.755 --> 00:22:49.996]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:50.156 --> 00:22:53.739]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:56.541]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:56.941 --> 00:22:58.682]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:59.023 --> 00:23:01.324]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:23:02.365 --> 00:23:16.794]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:23:16.854 --> 00:23:19.936]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[00:23:34.926 --> 00:23:36.768]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[00:23:51.383 --> 00:23:55.225]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[00:23:55.645 --> 00:24:00.628]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.

[00:24:33.262 --> 00:24:34.042]  He's going the distance!
[00:25:08.712 --> 00:25:11.054]  Okay, let's go back to Bob Chapman.
[00:25:12.055 --> 00:25:14.377]  Let's talk to Steve in New York.
[00:25:14.437 --> 00:25:16.599]  Steve, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.102]  Hi, I'm Steve.
[00:25:20.162 --> 00:25:21.904]  How are you doing, guys?
[00:25:21.924 --> 00:25:22.485]  Good.
[00:25:22.665 --> 00:25:26.548]  What I'm calling for today is, actually, I want to introduce myself.
[00:25:26.788 --> 00:25:34.335]  I work at a well-known company that I know you guys are very familiar with, and I've witnessed for myself
[00:25:36.448 --> 00:25:51.558]  You know, I think it's about the trade deals, not free trade, but trade deals that are made in different parts of the world, and that has a big effect on someone like me, who's a guy just trying to make a living.
[00:25:52.539 --> 00:26:00.144]  I have a story to tell, and I'm calling this show because I want to gain some trust and tell my story.
[00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.410]  Well, it's about control.
[00:26:03.851 --> 00:26:07.552]  It's about control, and that's what globalism and trade is.
[00:26:07.612 --> 00:26:16.936]  It's about wiping out trade in areas they want to consolidate, building up trade in areas they control, playing nations off against each other to bring in this world empire.
[00:26:16.956 --> 00:26:27.820]  They use finance and military to control, not just military, but we've got a lot of callers, Steve, and we've opened the phones up for calls for Bob Chapman on the economy, but just give us a summation of your story.
[00:26:29.437 --> 00:26:31.439]  Well, I really can't get in there on air.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.581]  It's going to get bigger.
[00:26:33.882 --> 00:26:45.676]  But what I can say is that what they're doing to people, native-born people here, to get rid of them is just as underhanded as can be.
[00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:48.299]  Yeah, I mean, the globalists are completely ruthless.
[00:26:48.359 --> 00:26:49.581]  The public needs to figure that out.
[00:26:50.709 --> 00:27:03.201]  And it is ruthless, and it's really a violation of rights and liberty, and I work in a company town, and it's all patrol.
[00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:13.210]  And I would like to get more details off there and get into it a little more, but I do have to proceed with caution at this point.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.381]  Alright, well then.
[00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:17.342]  On Air is not the place to do it, Steve.
[00:27:17.382 --> 00:27:18.302]  We appreciate your call.
[00:27:18.702 --> 00:27:20.783]  You can send us an email or send Bob something.
[00:27:20.803 --> 00:27:21.604]  We're just so busy.
[00:27:22.144 --> 00:27:23.185]  We know about the corruption.
[00:27:23.405 --> 00:27:24.625]  It's not a newsflash to us.
[00:27:24.685 --> 00:27:31.109]  We know they bring in foreigners, order you to train them, and then fire you, and then use the immigrants to do your job.
[00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:35.990]  And people say, well then who will buy the products once there's no economy here?
[00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.271]  The globalists then will shut that down.
[00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:42.052]  They use trade as a weapon to consolidate power.
[00:27:42.092 --> 00:27:43.472]  They don't want a free market.
[00:27:43.712 --> 00:27:44.972]  They don't want you independent.
[00:27:45.312 --> 00:27:46.913]  Bob, can you explain this to people?
[00:27:48.473 --> 00:27:51.594]  Well, I do and you very succinctly just did so.
[00:27:52.274 --> 00:27:56.815]  And it's the ripping of the heart of the American economy out.
[00:27:57.635 --> 00:28:00.116]  And it's just retching it from the body
[00:28:00.663 --> 00:28:04.064]  Of our country, so that people can't get jobs.
[00:28:04.905 --> 00:28:10.307]  And they don't care whether anybody buys anything, because the end result is what they're looking for.
[00:28:10.747 --> 00:28:24.873]  In the process, they're making lots of money, and especially for the transnational corporations who have subsidiaries that do this business outside the country, in places like Cayman Islands and the Bahamas and so on.
[00:28:25.513 --> 00:28:27.394]  And they're hiding their money offshore.
[00:28:27.927 --> 00:28:36.593]  And as you know, four years ago, our Congress allowed them to bring back $350 billion at five and a quarter percent taxation instead of 33.
[00:28:37.474 --> 00:28:40.956]  And now they want to do it again for $550 billion.
[00:28:41.177 --> 00:28:44.619]  Now let's explain to folks, because I've analyzed these cases, but you're really an expert on this.
[00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:45.620]  I want to get your response.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.345]  When we hear about them doing CBS news pieces about the Cayman Islands and how $200 and something billion of the bailout money went to the Caymans alone,
[00:28:54.486 --> 00:29:23.060]  They're just getting everybody mad so they can shut down small tax shelters because that became retail and the public started using the loopholes the banks had written for themselves just like most the White House doesn't pay taxes most the Congress doesn't pay taxes more and more of it comes out they have one set of rules and then we have another set of rules that we live under and if you look at it most multinational corporations pay less than one percent tax that's right and that's part of the way that they do that
[00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:33.505]  And of course, that embellishes the want of these international corporations to do such things, because in the process, they get richer and more powerful.
[00:29:34.145 --> 00:29:42.411]  And of course, at the same time, they destroy the infrastructure of not only the United States, but Mexico, Canada, and Europe.
[00:29:43.311 --> 00:29:44.132]  It's very simple.
[00:29:44.152 --> 00:29:49.996]  All those demonstrations over there are about money and income and jobs, and they're getting worse and worse.
[00:29:50.156 --> 00:29:52.758]  I had pitches that people sent me this week.
[00:29:53.163 --> 00:29:55.065]  of a major protest in Grenoble.
[00:29:55.705 --> 00:30:00.450]  And in this protest, they were wearing Jacobin outfits.
[00:30:01.131 --> 00:30:13.082]  And for those of you don't know, the Jacobins were the people during the revolution in France that went around and collected people so they could bring them to the guillotines to cut their heads off.
[00:30:13.963 --> 00:30:17.226]  And so there's some serious stuff going on all over the world.
[00:30:18.427 --> 00:30:28.194]  Bob, I want to talk about the nature of the New World Order, who they truly are, and then make more calls from Jake in Brazil, Kirk, Vanessa, Brent, and others.
[00:30:28.634 --> 00:30:29.354]  Straight ahead.
[00:30:29.435 --> 00:30:29.975]  Stay with us.
[00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:35.859]  We're on the march.
[00:30:36.359 --> 00:30:37.940]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:38.881 --> 00:30:41.563]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:44.841 --> 00:30:50.525]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:30:50.785 --> 00:30:55.568]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:30:55.808 --> 00:31:00.791]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:31:00.991 --> 00:31:04.433]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:31:04.913 --> 00:31:13.099]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:18.403]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:24.968]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:31:25.228 --> 00:31:27.550]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:32.033]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:31:32.053 --> 00:31:33.254]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:55.119]  Who is the enemy?
[00:31:55.619 --> 00:31:56.160]  Bin Laden.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.420]  This is his ammo.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.720]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.461]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:32:00.781 --> 00:32:07.543]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:32:07.923 --> 00:32:08.383]  Some U.S.
[00:32:08.423 --> 00:32:14.065]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:32:14.765 --> 00:32:18.248]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:32:18.268 --> 00:32:21.070]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:32:44.488 --> 00:32:47.510]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:51.253]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:57.677]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:32:58.037 --> 00:33:02.200]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:08.404]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:33:08.704 --> 00:33:11.706]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:33:14.428 --> 00:33:14.748]  I think so.
[00:33:49.795 --> 00:33:56.442]  We are only 17 days out from my new film, Drop, in the Info War.
[00:33:56.983 --> 00:33:58.364]  And it is a mighty weapon.
[00:33:59.606 --> 00:34:04.131]  It's a weapon that is self-replicating, if you will make copies of it and spread it.
[00:34:05.612 --> 00:34:09.416]  Every one of these in the Info War is like a rocket launcher.
[00:34:09.857 --> 00:34:10.437]  You pop up,
[00:34:11.781 --> 00:34:15.364]  At mines that have been seized by the enemy and you fire a red pill.
[00:34:16.244 --> 00:34:16.925]  Literally hits them.
[00:34:18.025 --> 00:34:19.426]  Blast through their programming.
[00:34:20.227 --> 00:34:24.530]  Because it's got the truth in it and it goes around the left, right propaganda paradigm.
[00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.711]  It gets into the real information.
[00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:30.374]  You need to picture these films as grenades.
[00:34:31.094 --> 00:34:33.716]  That you just throw into the zombie chambers.
[00:34:34.356 --> 00:34:34.977]  Boom!
[00:34:35.597 --> 00:34:36.178]  And many of them
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.141]  Wake up.
[00:34:38.561 --> 00:34:39.862]  Just keep throwing grenades.
[00:34:39.942 --> 00:34:40.683]  Keep firing.
[00:34:41.603 --> 00:34:43.985]  And at the same time, you're not just unlocking mines.
[00:34:45.207 --> 00:34:49.570]  Picture the enemy's Info War tanks coming over, blasting, firing at the population.
[00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:53.053]  And you're just up there with those rockets, blasting them, blowing them to bits.
[00:34:53.073 --> 00:34:53.954]  Hit them in the treads.
[00:34:56.276 --> 00:34:57.077]  Immobilize them.
[00:34:57.097 --> 00:34:58.738]  And then just keep getting more of the film out.
[00:34:58.778 --> 00:35:01.080]  Go in, throw a hand grenade down in the hatch.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:01.700]  Boom!
[00:35:03.593 --> 00:35:05.794]  Literally, ladies and gentlemen, we are savaging them.
[00:35:05.814 --> 00:35:09.915]  They have congressional hearings saying they want to shut us down for the Violent Radicalization Act.
[00:35:09.935 --> 00:35:11.236]  They list 9-11 truth cribs.
[00:35:11.556 --> 00:35:13.476]  They attack me in national publications.
[00:35:15.037 --> 00:35:20.139]  But they know if they kill me, it'll be like a hydrogen bomb going off, and we'll just get the info going that much faster.
[00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:23.520]  Because the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:35:26.092 --> 00:35:29.014]  And I mention that because it's such a big point of discussion.
[00:35:29.054 --> 00:35:30.916]  Why is Alex Jones still alive when they've killed so many?
[00:35:31.136 --> 00:35:35.579]  We've got a lady coming up in about 25 minutes who put out an international film about the diamond trade being a monopoly.
[00:35:35.819 --> 00:35:37.841]  We're going to go to Brazil in a moment, but I want Bob to comment on that.
[00:35:38.882 --> 00:35:39.722]  They came on her yacht.
[00:35:40.483 --> 00:35:41.203]  She's a British lady.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:48.781]  I remember the aristocracy over there and they said you shouldn't have made that film and they broke her jaw and broke her nose and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:35:48.821 --> 00:35:49.882]  I mean, this is real!
[00:35:50.542 --> 00:35:51.482]  But she didn't back off.
[00:35:51.922 --> 00:35:52.902]  She still released the film.
[00:35:53.802 --> 00:35:54.583]  And she's alive today.
[00:35:54.603 --> 00:35:56.423]  That happened, I don't know, 15 years ago.
[00:35:58.664 --> 00:35:59.004]  Or more.
[00:36:01.144 --> 00:36:02.505]  But the globalists are pirates.
[00:36:02.545 --> 00:36:07.266]  Think about New York City that was founded by Dutch but became the major pirate port.
[00:36:07.906 --> 00:36:10.607]  They would come from all the way from, you know, Asia.
[00:36:10.727 --> 00:36:11.207]  Pirates that
[00:36:13.266 --> 00:36:17.518]  road out there and around africa and latin america and the uh...
[00:36:18.846 --> 00:36:19.226]  Horn.
[00:36:19.987 --> 00:36:23.230]  And they would bring their goods to safe haven pirate ports.
[00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:24.611]  Well, what is Luxembourg?
[00:36:24.651 --> 00:36:25.551]  What is the Cayman Islands?
[00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:26.372]  What is the Bahamas?
[00:36:26.652 --> 00:36:27.453]  What is Portugal?
[00:36:27.493 --> 00:36:28.274]  What is Switzerland?
[00:36:28.834 --> 00:36:29.955]  Those are pirate ports.
[00:36:30.355 --> 00:36:37.441]  And if you study Skull & Bones and other globalist groups, they made their money out of the opium trade in the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company.
[00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:38.402]  And they founded it with that.
[00:36:38.422 --> 00:36:44.466]  And they set up CIA exclusively in 1947, out of the OSS, out of Skull & Bones.
[00:36:44.967 --> 00:36:45.948]  Just a British chapter.
[00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.214]  Here in the United States.
[00:36:48.817 --> 00:36:49.620]  This is all history.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.769]  This is mainline history, just not taught in schools.
[00:36:53.447 --> 00:36:57.069]  And that's why they say little hymns and little prayers at Skull and Bones.
[00:36:57.089 --> 00:37:03.953]  And when I was also at Bohemian Grove, they had all these big banners and plaques to different famous pirates.
[00:37:04.494 --> 00:37:06.475]  Because they see themselves as pirates.
[00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:09.957]  And they are setting up a global order where they're outside the nations.
[00:37:09.997 --> 00:37:11.898]  They don't follow any laws.
[00:37:11.918 --> 00:37:12.639]  They're exempt.
[00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:19.403]  And they just destroy nations and come in and loot them and then bring the wealth offshore and finance destroying the next nation.
[00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:33.254]  That's why big banks will just give billions of dollars of free weapons systems to a Latin American country, to a rebel group, to an African group, to then wreck that country so that country has to fight them and the banks will fund the terrorists, the rebels, and the government.
[00:37:34.055 --> 00:37:47.219]  I was watching, I haven't seen it yet, a clip from the film The International, and the guy's explaining, they're going, why do you think big banks fund rebels or fund terror groups or fund other governments to have a war when they're not even making money on it?
[00:37:47.459 --> 00:37:49.080]  Because they make money on the destruction.
[00:37:50.523 --> 00:37:51.443]  These are pirates.
[00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:57.544]  And Bob Chapman, I wanted to get your response to that, sir.
[00:37:58.884 --> 00:38:01.045]  I've never heard it more eloquently put.
[00:38:02.385 --> 00:38:05.245]  But you're certainly right about the drug trade.
[00:38:06.006 --> 00:38:13.287]  And most of the major families in New England and along the eastern seaboard were involved with the British.
[00:38:14.107 --> 00:38:18.828]  And that's the Cabots and the Lodges and the Forbes and all of them.
[00:38:19.408 --> 00:38:19.948]  And they were
[00:38:20.638 --> 00:38:30.103]  Privatizing or, uh, carrying, uh, uh, heroin, uh, opium, uh, from, uh, India over to China.
[00:38:30.883 --> 00:38:33.024]  And, uh, they made vast fortunes.
[00:38:33.084 --> 00:38:33.865]  This was in the early 1800s.
[00:38:34.025 --> 00:38:35.426]  The Roosevelts!
[00:38:37.027 --> 00:38:38.287]  Yes, they were all involved.
[00:38:38.327 --> 00:38:39.108]  All the big names.
[00:38:40.068 --> 00:38:44.951]  And, uh, and that's how they, in modern times, they funded what they were doing.
[00:38:45.271 --> 00:38:47.392]  But they did the same thing in the Middle East as well.
[00:38:48.112 --> 00:38:49.413]  And you write about them,
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:59.885]  Financing both sides of almost every conflict because when it's over, they step in and they finance the redevelopment and get even richer and more powerful.
[00:39:00.866 --> 00:39:04.108]  And this is the game that they play over and over and over again.
[00:39:04.248 --> 00:39:17.775]  Yet today, we have radio programs such as yours and the Internet that tell the people what they're not being told in school or in the mainline media, that this is what these people do for a living.
[00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:21.605]  And, you know, if it kills 20 or 50 million people, they don't care.
[00:39:22.786 --> 00:39:23.907]  I mean, they are pirates.
[00:39:25.028 --> 00:39:26.850]  It's quite an example you just gave.
[00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:27.951]  It's really excellent.
[00:39:28.612 --> 00:39:30.373]  Well, that's what they say about themselves.
[00:39:30.453 --> 00:39:36.659]  I mean, they brag that they're swashbuckling pirates and it's a big joke on all of us.
[00:39:38.141 --> 00:39:39.742]  I want to go to calls, Bob.
[00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:47.738]  Just briefly, as this guest is coming up later, it's public knowledge, it's a public secret, but most people don't know it.
[00:39:48.498 --> 00:39:57.929]  An average guy will be getting married when he's 25, he's making $30,000 a year, he'll buy a $10,000 diamond for his betrothed, and she's got to have it.
[00:39:57.969 --> 00:40:02.113]  And they don't know that diamonds are semi-precious, literally are crap.
[00:40:02.754 --> 00:40:17.546]  They're just geographically only in certain areas, so they can artificially control that, and how in the last 150 years, they sold this as the gem that everybody has to have, is the diamond, and it's another example of a total scam, a total cartel.
[00:40:18.446 --> 00:40:19.127]  Absolutely.
[00:40:19.507 --> 00:40:22.289]  There's enough diamonds in the world to bury it.
[00:40:24.771 --> 00:40:31.717]  Intrinsically, they have little or no value, and that value has been created by De Beers and others, but particularly De Beers.
[00:40:32.153 --> 00:40:35.014]  Which is controlled indirectly by the Royal Family.
[00:40:35.654 --> 00:40:51.577]  And they're the ones who financed all of the projects in South Africa, and they're the ones that used Madison Ave tactics, especially after the turn of the 21st century, in the early 1900s.
[00:40:57.879 --> 00:40:58.919]  I don't
[00:41:17.253 --> 00:41:20.596]  And all of that wealth returned to the masters.
[00:41:20.816 --> 00:41:25.640]  And he wrote that they were going to create a British Empire through international finance that would be behind the throne.
[00:41:26.701 --> 00:41:35.047]  And again, they geographically control the diamonds, where they come from, Australia, Africa mainly, a little bit in South America.
[00:41:35.828 --> 00:41:44.453]  And because they geographically control that, even with mercenaries who they brag they'll send in to kill anybody that tries to mine them, then they call them blood diamonds, anybody else that wants to dig them and not pay their cut.
[00:41:44.473 --> 00:41:48.436]  I know we've got to ban this through humanitarian auspices, total fraud.
[00:41:48.456 --> 00:41:49.637]  It's the same thing with drugs.
[00:41:49.657 --> 00:41:59.603]  They make narcotics illegal so they can geographically control them to make hundreds of times what the drugs are really worth, which then criminalizes everything and lets them take over that way.
[00:42:00.003 --> 00:42:01.043]  Good day to both of you men.
[00:42:01.063 --> 00:42:04.344]  Alex, I've agreed with you over the years on at least 95% of what you've said and taught.
[00:42:29.804 --> 00:42:51.045]  I was curious though why you and your fill-in Romero in the past month or two have been down on Israel and are blaming Israel for breaking the peace treaty and I'd like to know your exact thought of Israel and the Jews.
[00:42:53.683 --> 00:42:56.846]  Kirk, look, we're here talking about economic issues.
[00:42:58.468 --> 00:43:02.813]  You know, I try not to get into this endless, ongoing debate.
[00:43:02.873 --> 00:43:06.096]  And I get attacked by those that say I'm too easy on Israel.
[00:43:06.537 --> 00:43:08.779]  I get attacked by those that say I'm too hard on Israel.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:17.986]  You know, Hillary Clinton, who's always flip-flopping, she's been criticizing Israel, so now she's being broiled in the media.
[00:43:18.826 --> 00:43:22.049]  Israel is being used as a military outpost.
[00:43:22.169 --> 00:43:24.630]  Benjamin Netanyahu wants to attack Iran.
[00:43:24.931 --> 00:43:26.392]  That is going to cause World War III.
[00:43:26.492 --> 00:43:30.014]  Every military expert we've talked to and geopolitical expert has said.
[00:43:34.518 --> 00:43:35.260]  You know, I love this.
[00:43:35.682 --> 00:43:37.950]  This is the dumb downness of the American people.
[00:43:38.773 --> 00:43:40.299]  That if I am against
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:58.756]  What happened in Israel, where they shut down the border crossings and started doing targeted killings, which did break the peace treaty, and then Hamas is shooting these tinker toy rockets over, and then Israel goes in and levels, and then now we've got to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to go in there and rebuild it.
[00:43:59.276 --> 00:44:05.522]  All that does is then embroil the entire Middle East, and public opinion turns against the United States and Israel.
[00:44:05.802 --> 00:44:07.584]  I'm saying I'm against what happened there.
[00:44:08.344 --> 00:44:10.766]  And then that doesn't become, I hate Jews.
[00:44:11.407 --> 00:44:12.548]  Okay?
[00:44:12.628 --> 00:44:13.849]  It's totally separate.
[00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:16.071]  It's completely separate.
[00:44:16.652 --> 00:44:18.253]  And that's all I have to say on that issue.
[00:44:18.273 --> 00:44:19.074]  I want to move on here.
[00:44:19.374 --> 00:44:22.236]  Let's talk to Vanessa in New York.
[00:44:22.457 --> 00:44:23.497]  Vanessa, you're on the air.
[00:44:23.517 --> 00:44:25.099]  Hi Alex.
[00:44:25.239 --> 00:44:25.639]  Hi Bob.
[00:44:25.659 --> 00:44:26.520]  How are you guys doing?
[00:44:27.221 --> 00:44:27.441]  Good.
[00:44:28.602 --> 00:44:29.783]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[00:44:31.629 --> 00:44:33.610]  I have a question, actually.
[00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:38.513]  I don't know if you want to say it's based on an economic problem, so I hate to get off subject.
[00:44:38.753 --> 00:44:39.254]  Hey, it's fine.
[00:44:39.294 --> 00:44:41.055]  Nobody calls in about subjects on this show.
[00:44:41.235 --> 00:44:43.617]  Go ahead.
[00:44:43.637 --> 00:44:51.302]  I heard this morning on another radio show that they're putting through a bill, H.R.
[00:44:51.322 --> 00:44:55.125]  1105, talking about the RFID and the NAIS chip.
[00:44:55.805 --> 00:44:58.387]  And I want to know what I can do or I can go to protest this.
[00:44:59.256 --> 00:45:00.937]  Um, just a lead or something like that.
[00:45:01.358 --> 00:45:08.864]  Okay, well let me tell you, I mean, through, through, well this is economic, because the big agribusiness wants to shut down family farms and ranches.
[00:45:09.144 --> 00:45:20.673]  They've written the federal regulations that aren't law, but through fiat or enforced as law at the state level, to where small farms and ranches have to put a $15, $20 tag on a $5 chicken.
[00:45:20.973 --> 00:45:21.574]  Bankrupts them.
[00:45:22.474 --> 00:45:27.038]  Uh, or where you have to have your premises registered and then you waive your rights in that contract.
[00:45:28.024 --> 00:45:35.073]  Now, only a few states pass it as law, like Texas, but then that got defeated in the courts, but they still go ahead with it.
[00:45:35.674 --> 00:45:38.938]  Bob, do you want to comment on the National Animal ID and the Premises ID?
[00:45:40.581 --> 00:45:42.203]  It's really out of my category.
[00:45:43.244 --> 00:45:46.068]  I know what you know, generally speaking, and that's it.
[00:45:47.472 --> 00:45:50.373]  Yes, so ma'am, people are fighting the Animal I.D.
[00:45:50.413 --> 00:45:51.173]  Premises I.D.
[00:45:51.713 --> 00:45:54.354]  everywhere, and I would just Google N.I.S.
[00:45:54.514 --> 00:45:55.695]  or Animal I.D.
[00:45:55.735 --> 00:45:56.355]  Premises I.D.
[00:45:56.395 --> 00:45:58.436]  in your state if you want to fight it.
[00:45:58.476 --> 00:45:59.676]  There's national groups fighting it.
[00:45:59.696 --> 00:46:01.677]  We've had a lot of those groups here on the show.
[00:46:02.957 --> 00:46:10.320]  I appreciate it, and also I have a comment on CNBC's reaction to Ron Paul.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.861]  They said that they were going to
[00:46:14.042 --> 00:46:19.103]  Come back when they were playing something more substandard, and I just thought that was great that they admitted that.
[00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:21.064]  In fact, I have the transcript here.
[00:46:21.604 --> 00:46:23.224]  They said, we're going to come back.
[00:46:24.264 --> 00:46:27.745]  I actually have the text here.
[00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:28.625]  I appreciate your call, ma'am.
[00:46:28.665 --> 00:46:29.365]  Let me go ahead and read it.
[00:46:30.386 --> 00:46:32.586]  Haines says, this is not going as planned.
[00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:33.386]  No, it is not.
[00:46:33.506 --> 00:46:34.787]  This is when they cut away from Ron Paul.
[00:46:35.587 --> 00:46:40.028]  We were told that there was a very limited number of opening statements, and it seems to be getting out of control.
[00:46:40.108 --> 00:46:40.348]  Burn it.
[00:46:41.684 --> 00:46:42.744]  Here's what we forgot.
[00:46:42.784 --> 00:46:44.485]  Everybody is taking this live.
[00:46:44.585 --> 00:46:46.065]  You know what that means.
[00:46:46.766 --> 00:46:48.826]  Why would they miss an opportunity for free air time?
[00:46:49.346 --> 00:47:00.470]  Hanes, we're going to take a commercial break and get them out of the way so that when something really substandard, he means substantial, is happening, we don't have to interrupt them.
[00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:07.953]  So the image here is how dare these elected congressmen, who are supposedly over the Federal Reserve, which they're not, bring up the fact the Federal Reserve is destroying America.
[00:47:08.313 --> 00:47:08.973]  How dare them?
[00:47:09.033 --> 00:47:10.934]  We'll cut back once Bernanke's up there.
[00:47:11.454 --> 00:47:13.895]  Because normally they don't show the congressmen asking serious questions.
[00:47:13.915 --> 00:47:15.976]  They only show the private bankers.
[00:47:16.276 --> 00:47:17.196]  Bob Chapman comments.
[00:47:18.657 --> 00:47:22.278]  We're carrying that piece from InfoWars in tomorrow's issue.
[00:47:23.385 --> 00:47:26.507]  And so you'll be able to see it there as well as on Alex's site.
[00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:27.347]  Absolutely.
[00:47:27.428 --> 00:47:37.113]  And I saw the live version and that's exactly the way it happened and I was surprised because they've admitted that they're managing the news.
[00:47:39.255 --> 00:47:40.756]  Well, it's just all right out in the open.
[00:47:41.436 --> 00:47:44.498]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brent in Texas.
[00:47:44.558 --> 00:47:45.358]  Brent, you're on the air.
[00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:47.780]  Yeah, hey guys.
[00:47:49.875 --> 00:47:51.776]  Thanks for all the information you put out.
[00:47:51.816 --> 00:47:52.677]  It's really incredible.
[00:47:52.697 --> 00:47:58.100]  I don't know how you can put out so much material consistently, but I'm thankful that you do.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:03.783]  The question was for Bob, and I emailed you about this, so I'm glad I got through.
[00:48:03.803 --> 00:48:04.824]  I'm very surprised.
[00:48:05.044 --> 00:48:05.725]  Thanks for taking the call.
[00:48:05.745 --> 00:48:06.345]  Just for Bob today.
[00:48:06.365 --> 00:48:06.645]  You bet.
[00:48:06.665 --> 00:48:07.386]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:48:08.386 --> 00:48:09.247]  Yeah.
[00:48:09.967 --> 00:48:18.812]  So, Bob, the question was, I know you're familiar with Prector's Elliott Wave analysis, because you've commented on it on occasion in the newsletter.
[00:48:20.376 --> 00:48:35.567]  You know, lately, I think it was the last week or so, he came out and basically said, in this grand, what he calls a grand super-cycle bear market, that he'd be surprised if futures even existed after it's over.
[00:48:35.587 --> 00:48:45.794]  Now, he didn't give any kind of timeline, because that's impossible, but, you know, clearly it'd be devastating for the markets if, you know, a major futures exchange went under.
[00:48:45.834 --> 00:48:46.575]  But what do you think?
[00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:51.280]  About the likelihood of that, the prospect of that, and if it was possible.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:57.582]  Yeah, let me add, let me add about a Comex, the gold futures defaulting.
[00:48:57.602 --> 00:49:00.723]  Can you comment on both of those?
[00:49:01.003 --> 00:49:05.604]  First of all, I'll answer Alex, possible and probable.
[00:49:06.605 --> 00:49:12.326]  And to answer the original question, and that is, you know, we can have physical markets.
[00:49:12.767 --> 00:49:13.887]  We don't need futures.
[00:49:14.967 --> 00:49:20.091]  And maybe we should revamp the whole futures system so that it can't be rigged by government.
[00:49:21.392 --> 00:49:32.501]  Just like we should privatize the SEC and the CFTC so that they don't cooperate with the criminals in Washington in a Wall Street.
[00:49:33.122 --> 00:49:39.727]  I mean, the Madoff affair, and now we got the Stanford thing, SEC knew about Madoff
[00:49:40.343 --> 00:49:46.507]  Seven or eight or nine years ago, refused to do anything, and they knew it was a scam and there's hundreds of people involved.
[00:49:46.908 --> 00:49:50.910]  And with Stanford, they were told to stand down by another government agency.
[00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:52.552]  I mean, what is this?
[00:49:53.172 --> 00:49:57.035]  So, referring back to the futures markets, there's no control.
[00:49:57.395 --> 00:50:04.099]  The only control is the United States government doing what they want to do to those markets by manipulating and rigging them.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.580]  And it's got to stop.
[00:50:05.841 --> 00:50:09.203]  And if it doesn't stop, people ain't gonna play the game anymore.
[00:50:09.713 --> 00:50:10.053]  All right.
[00:50:33.786 --> 00:50:35.507]  Absolutely, well that's what the pirates want.
[00:50:35.927 --> 00:50:38.668]  And then they sucker the people back into the market so they can screw them.
[00:50:39.008 --> 00:50:40.628]  Ben in Oregon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:44.289]  I had two comments for you guys.
[00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:54.733]  One, actually I heard just on Russia's show right before I turned on your show, he actually admitted that they're saying that there's going to be a one world government and a one world currency.
[00:50:55.133 --> 00:50:57.733]  But was he saying that if you're against it, you're bad?
[00:50:57.773 --> 00:50:59.254]  Because before he did, he said it didn't exist.
[00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:01.670]  Uh, no, he just said it on there.
[00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:06.231]  He said, I think he was referring to another piece that a news organization was putting out.
[00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:07.851]  Well, yeah, it's in hundreds of mails.
[00:51:09.152 --> 00:51:16.193]  Yeah, but he was just basically admitting it and saying that, you know, the liberals are going to be behind all of it, which he normally does.
[00:51:16.853 --> 00:51:17.213]  Stay there.
[00:51:17.233 --> 00:51:18.713]  I want to hear more about this when we get back.
[00:51:18.753 --> 00:51:19.393]  That's a big deal.
[00:51:19.713 --> 00:51:27.495]  But, I mean, Russia spent 16, 17, 18 years telling people none of this existed when the guy's smart and knows all about it.
[00:51:30.169 --> 00:51:43.440]  I've been wondering the last few months, how is he going to say it doesn't exist when the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, CNN, the Times of London, the New York Times are all saying world government's real, the banks are going to rule you, but that it's good.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.261]  It's good.
[00:51:44.661 --> 00:51:49.545]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what
[00:51:49.565 --> 00:51:52.746]  It's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:51:52.907 --> 00:51:57.289]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:51:57.469 --> 00:52:01.971]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:52:02.131 --> 00:52:04.412]  It's a documented fact.
[00:52:04.432 --> 00:52:11.035]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:52:11.195 --> 00:52:17.258]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing
[00:52:17.458 --> 00:52:18.078]  I think so.
[00:52:46.676 --> 00:52:53.024]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:52:53.044 --> 00:52:54.646]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:52:54.727 --> 00:53:01.275]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:53:10.918 --> 00:53:15.808]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:53:17.287 --> 00:53:18.188]  Inside, John.
[00:53:19.569 --> 00:53:21.830]  How dare you?
[00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:27.094]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:53:27.234 --> 00:53:29.896]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:53:29.976 --> 00:53:35.600]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of Donald Trump.
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.220]  Truth Rising.

[00:53:49.061 --> 00:53:51.024]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:56.232]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[00:53:57.666 --> 00:54:01.588]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[00:54:01.648 --> 00:54:05.809]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[00:54:06.269 --> 00:54:12.072]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.

[00:54:40.097 --> 00:54:41.538]  survivalistseeds.com
[00:54:50.868 --> 00:55:19.449]  You see, the globalists and their own Trilateral Commission and CFR publications that were public, just not widely distributed, and everybody in the controlled media knew they didn't talk about it, but they'd lose their job, was they had to build world government, destroy the industry of Western Europe and the United States and Japan, get everybody in debt in the debt-based economy, tell everybody to get in debt, then blow it all out, have a fire sale, and then say, we'll save you with world government and carbon taxes you pay to us.
[00:55:21.227 --> 00:55:31.487]  And, you know, Limbaugh can't come on the air and say it's a liberal conspiracy and the Republicans will save you because, you know, it's neocon publications pushing this world government as well.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:51.228]  But, Bush played the bad cop, now Obama's the good cop, the facelift to the New World Order, and now because they're openly setting it up, and you're going to be paying your taxes to them, and satellite tracker boxes in your cars, and neighborhood tattletale squads, and everything else, they have to emerge out into the open, and that's what the Obama deception covers.
[00:55:51.828 --> 00:55:53.549]  The film is about Obama, but it isn't.
[00:55:53.929 --> 00:55:58.611]  It just shows how he's a front man and puppet, and you learn the whole globalist agenda, what they're doing, what they're setting up.
[00:55:58.671 --> 00:56:00.072]  It's such an important film, folks.
[00:56:01.072 --> 00:56:05.014]  It's not going to be about was he really born in Africa, which will just bounce off his armor.
[00:56:05.375 --> 00:56:09.357]  This is the black arrow to this political dragon.
[00:56:10.237 --> 00:56:16.661]  And I want to hold you five minutes over, Bob Chapman, and we'll get our guest on from England if you can do it, unless you have something else that's coming up.
[00:56:16.701 --> 00:56:30.149]  But, I mean, your comments on this, because I've actually had other people tell me in days past he's been admitting it, and I know a lot of mainline conservatives are admitting it is true, but your take on them having to admit all this now?
[00:56:32.506 --> 00:56:37.628]  Well, I think that it's part of their process of exposure.
[00:56:38.229 --> 00:56:42.711]  They're getting ready to pull the plug on the entire world economy.
[00:56:42.751 --> 00:56:43.971]  They haven't even done that yet.
[00:56:44.352 --> 00:56:48.494]  I mean, what you're seeing going on here, all these problems, is really child's play.
[00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:50.114]  It hasn't got bad yet.
[00:56:50.374 --> 00:56:51.475]  Yeah, they're setting the table.
[00:56:52.555 --> 00:56:53.116]  Exactly.
[00:56:53.156 --> 00:56:59.979]  And we're looking out two, maybe three years still, until they're ready, and then all of a sudden the deflation will begin.
[00:57:00.743 --> 00:57:04.084]  And then all of a sudden, everything will just go haywire.
[00:57:04.844 --> 00:57:07.845]  And they're coming out in anticipation of this.
[00:57:08.185 --> 00:57:19.829]  This is part of the propaganda and brainwashing to make people start to begin to think in terms that they are going to be saved by a one-world entity of some kind.
[00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:26.871]  Now, I have another article... What they're doing, and you pointed this out last week, Alex, was the propaganda by Soros and
[00:57:30.051 --> 00:57:43.275]  One of those fellas on Fox, he came out and said the Bubba's are going to attack and so you better be ready for it.
[00:57:43.855 --> 00:57:48.736]  They're preparing people to try to go and do that so they can implement martial law.
[00:57:48.756 --> 00:57:50.616]  You remember last week that was the bottom line?
[00:57:50.977 --> 00:57:51.997]  Well it's the same thing.
[00:57:52.457 --> 00:57:56.418]  This is a big propaganda war that's going on and they're heating the people up.
[00:57:57.537 --> 00:57:57.857]  That's right.
[00:57:57.877 --> 00:57:58.998]  They want us to go away.
[00:57:59.038 --> 00:58:00.360]  They want us to start blasting.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.982]  That is not what we want.
[00:58:03.022 --> 00:58:15.394]  We want to politically point out they're the criminals, take control of the states, and educate the public that it's the globalists that did this, and that letting them set up this World Bank will only hurt us worse.
[00:58:16.135 --> 00:58:18.297]  Any other comments, Ben, in Oregon?
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:37.130]  Oh yeah, I just, I was going to ask Bob Chapman about, I have a, actually it's my wife's 401k, and I tried rolling it over into a IRA money market account, and her company says that we can't do anything with her 401k until she either quits or gets fired or something like that.
[00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:38.631]  Is there anything else I could do?
[00:58:38.991 --> 00:58:40.352]  I believe that's just a lie.
[00:58:40.492 --> 00:58:45.094]  With most 401ks, she can demand it be liquidated, but some places have a clause.
[00:58:45.114 --> 00:58:47.976]  A lot of companies have really already leveraged that money and spent it, Bob.
[00:58:49.657 --> 00:58:51.798]  Um, they can do what they want to do.
[00:58:52.659 --> 00:58:58.042]  And, uh, if she tries to move it, or if she wants to liquidate it, she's out the door.
[00:58:58.803 --> 00:59:00.664]  And it's as simple as that, and they can do that.
[00:59:01.144 --> 00:59:05.787]  And I run into a lot of them like that, and some of them you can borrow 90%, some of them you can borrow 10%.
[00:59:07.008 --> 00:59:08.649]  It varies from company to company.
[00:59:09.389 --> 00:59:19.035]  And, uh, you know, the same thing they're trying to pull also with people who are liquidating life and annuity policies, because they don't think that the insurance companies will pay up.
[00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:21.510]  Alright Bob, stay there.
[00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:23.172]  I want to do five more minutes with you.
[00:59:26.256 --> 00:59:28.358]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:34.568 --> 00:59:36.130]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:40.877]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:40.997 --> 00:59:43.761]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:43.961 --> 00:59:46.825]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:47.005 --> 00:59:51.732]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:51.952 --> 00:59:52.893]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:53.073 --> 00:59:56.016]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:56.316 --> 01:00:03.222]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:00:37.162 --> 01:00:39.083]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:39.563 --> 01:00:42.445]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:48.948 --> 01:00:49.588]  Big Brother.
[01:00:50.248 --> 01:00:51.329]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:52.009 --> 01:00:53.110]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:54.591]  You want answers?
[01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.271]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:56.291 --> 01:01:00.714]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:01.094 --> 01:01:03.435]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:01:04.332 --> 01:01:05.173]  Alex Jones.
[01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:08.294]  Already into hour number three.
[01:01:08.314 --> 01:01:12.296]  We have a very informative guest coming up about how these global monopolies and scams work.
[01:01:12.657 --> 01:01:13.477]  Dealing with diamonds.
[01:01:13.517 --> 01:01:15.598]  We'll have your phone calls then as well.
[01:01:16.679 --> 01:01:20.541]  I do again hope listeners will go to the obamadeception.net and pre-order the film.
[01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:25.384]  It's going to be shipping out now in only 17 days or technically
[01:01:26.685 --> 01:01:28.327]  16 days, so it'll be shipping on the 15th.
[01:01:28.627 --> 01:01:32.131]  Get your orders in now so you get the Obama deception first.
[01:01:32.191 --> 01:01:43.143]  It breaks down the history of the global banking system, how Obama is their front man, his history, how he's a globalist, his policies, his lies, how he's betraying people, how both parties are controlled.
[01:01:43.303 --> 01:01:44.625]  This is powerful.
[01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:45.586]  Very well done.
[01:01:46.046 --> 01:01:46.927]  The film is done now.
[01:01:47.867 --> 01:01:55.115]  We're just doing some music sweetening and working on the credits and some extras right now and it'll be sent off to be mass manufactured on Monday.
[01:01:55.755 --> 01:02:00.120]  And so I hope you will get your orders in for the Obama Deception at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:00.340]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:02:07.748 --> 01:02:11.231]  Also, the Obama Deception will be in super high quality on March 15th.
[01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:12.172]  That's Sunday evening.
[01:02:12.232 --> 01:02:14.173]  It's going to go up on that 15th.
[01:02:14.834 --> 01:02:17.276]  Sunday release on the Ides of March.
[01:02:17.376 --> 01:02:18.637]  We didn't intend to release it on that.
[01:02:18.657 --> 01:02:21.079]  People pointed out it was the Ides of March later, but I think that's poignant.
[01:02:21.099 --> 01:02:24.641]  We're trying to kill the lie of the New World Order in a peaceful, info way.
[01:02:24.661 --> 01:02:27.203]  And, you know, expose the big fraud.
[01:02:28.424 --> 01:02:29.205]  Expose the hoax.
[01:02:29.285 --> 01:02:29.986]  Kill the hoax.
[01:02:32.808 --> 01:02:33.668]  And by that,
[01:02:34.813 --> 01:02:37.335]  Lift the veil of the left-right paradigm from people's eyes.
[01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:40.116]  So again, the Obama deception, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:41.077 --> 01:02:51.343]  And don't forget, Bob Chapman, you can get a free trial introductory, goes out a couple times a week, e-format of The International Forecaster at theinternationalforecaster.com.
[01:02:51.683 --> 01:02:52.623]  Be sure and check that out.
[01:02:53.244 --> 01:02:54.605]  Bob, in closing here,
[01:02:55.796 --> 01:02:59.397]  Well, I think they won't want to admit it, and the design has been there for a long time.
[01:03:24.068 --> 01:03:32.873]  They're not up to what's going on, and they have to listen to programs like this in order to find out, and they will in time, but most of them just don't know.
[01:03:33.353 --> 01:03:34.594]  I just wrote this this morning.
[01:03:35.195 --> 01:03:38.496]  State governments ran up pension fund losses of $865.1 billion in 2008.
[01:03:38.536 --> 01:03:44.340]  The assets of 109 pension funds fell 37% to $1.46 trillion in the 14-month period ending this past December.
[01:03:53.806 --> 01:04:04.194]  The biggest fund with $260 billion in assets and at height in October 2007 is down over that period of time 40%.
[01:04:04.654 --> 01:04:12.980]  So I think a fair figure is on average is 40% except for pension funds that kept all their money in bonds.
[01:04:14.293 --> 01:04:19.698]  And also insurance companies, which are mutual companies, who kept their money in bonds.
[01:04:20.138 --> 01:04:20.979]  They are safer.
[01:04:21.279 --> 01:04:28.626]  Where do we get this number of people's savings or 401Ks or retirements that are based on stock being down over 60%?
[01:04:28.746 --> 01:04:31.548]  Is that folks who were invested in the wrong sectors?
[01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:33.550]  That could be.
[01:04:34.031 --> 01:04:37.814]  But overall, you have to take the more conservative viewpoint.
[01:04:38.314 --> 01:04:41.117]  So in the last 20 months since the market started down,
[01:04:41.536 --> 01:04:45.258]  From 14,160 or whatever the number was up there.
[01:04:45.878 --> 01:04:49.560]  And we got everybody out of 14, incidentally, who was listening.
[01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:58.385]  That drop in those professional managed portfolios is down about 45% on average.
[01:04:58.786 --> 01:04:59.226]  All right.
[01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:00.486]  And so it's not very good.
[01:05:00.627 --> 01:05:06.690]  And if the Dow goes where I think it will go to around 4,038 to 4,200, then I think they're going to take another 35% hit.
[01:05:11.391 --> 01:05:11.871]  I don't think so.
[01:05:29.824 --> 01:05:32.045]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:05:32.085 --> 01:05:34.286]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:05:34.326 --> 01:05:39.129]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:05:55.879 --> 01:05:58.700]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[01:07:44.399 --> 01:07:53.145]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:07:53.325 --> 01:07:58.089]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.

[01:08:49.884 --> 01:08:52.224]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:52.504 --> 01:08:59.626]  Well, joining us from the United Kingdom is Jeannine Roberts.
[01:08:59.666 --> 01:09:01.986]  We had her on, I think, eight years ago.
[01:09:02.007 --> 01:09:03.387]  I remember back in
[01:09:04.778 --> 01:09:13.481]  College, or was it high school, seeing on PBS part of the film that she made, The Diamond Empire.
[01:09:13.501 --> 01:09:26.986]  I've since seen the whole thing, and it was everything that I'd already learned and read in history, and also learned from my dad, who had gone to college with some French guys who were South African, who had tried to break the diamond monopoly in their own little way, the DeBool brothers.
[01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:39.464]  And they're the guys that actually bought up some diamond mines in Arkansas, and the federal government claimed environmental reasons and bought them out for billions of dollars.
[01:09:40.024 --> 01:09:41.285]  So that happened later.
[01:09:42.725 --> 01:09:51.689]  So I've kind of, from my position, seen a little bit of the inside of this going on growing up in Dallas, because my dad still is friends with the DeBool brothers.
[01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:55.671]  Separate from De Beers.
[01:09:56.291 --> 01:09:57.251]  That's the big monopoly.
[01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.092]  But it's just amazing.
[01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:07.476]  And then I've seen articles in things like New Yorker Magazine where De Beers brags they hire mercenaries and attack helicopters that go in, you know.
[01:10:07.856 --> 01:10:10.137]  And we hear this propaganda about stopping blood diamonds.
[01:10:10.197 --> 01:10:13.779]  Oh, anybody else that mines them that isn't certified is hurting children.
[01:10:13.839 --> 01:10:14.880]  No, that's propaganda.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.801]  It is the diamond monopoly that causes all the violence.
[01:10:18.141 --> 01:10:19.662]  These things are only semi-precious.
[01:10:20.402 --> 01:10:21.602]  Now, that's the basics.
[01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:25.424]  We're carrying her new book, Glitter and Greed, by Janine Roberts.
[01:10:25.444 --> 01:10:28.185]  We have it in the shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:28.205 --> 01:10:36.607]  For those that want to explain to their wife or their girlfriend or their fiancé, you know, who wants some $20,000 diamond rings, she's got to have it, that they are semi-precious.
[01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:41.689]  And if she wants a fine stone, get something else, like a ruby or an emerald that actually has true value.
[01:10:42.509 --> 01:10:46.990]  People kind of found this out now, so they're buying colored diamonds, because those actually are rare in some cases.
[01:10:49.131 --> 01:10:50.531]  Don't be chumps, don't be ripped off.
[01:10:50.892 --> 01:10:54.393]  She was physically attacked over making the film and threatened not to release it, but she still did.
[01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:56.553]  Just an incredible lady.
[01:10:56.593 --> 01:10:59.954]  So Janine Roberts, joining us from England, thank you for coming on.
[01:11:00.615 --> 01:11:02.295]  It's a pleasure, it's a great privilege.
[01:11:03.275 --> 01:11:05.036]  Okay, you've got the floor.
[01:11:05.276 --> 01:11:18.360]  Just boil it down, your story, your saga, the film, the book, everything you went through, what you discovered, how you got in when they wouldn't let anybody else get in and show warehouses of just diamonds being massed to create artificial scarcity.
[01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:20.193]  I have.
[01:11:20.453 --> 01:11:22.774]  I've run my hands through buckets of diamonds.
[01:11:22.854 --> 01:11:23.354]  Literally.
[01:11:23.914 --> 01:11:24.334]  Literally.
[01:11:25.095 --> 01:11:26.075]  Thousands of diamonds.
[01:11:26.275 --> 01:11:33.437]  They're not, you know, the thing about diamonds is unlike some other stones like sapphires and emeralds, they're not really that rare.
[01:11:34.077 --> 01:11:35.438]  You can even manufacture them.
[01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.178]  You can even cheat.
[01:11:38.039 --> 01:11:42.480]  And, uh, but, you know, a long time ago they were rare.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.621]  It was when they came out of India and Indian mines were running down and
[01:11:46.636 --> 01:12:00.560]  The rich folk in Europe, they bought up these diamonds, they infested in them, and then people went out to South Africa, and later on to Australia, and they found them by the, not the bucketful, but by the bathful.
[01:12:02.141 --> 01:12:14.064]  In South Africa, I've been told by a foreman that ran part of a De Beers mine, that occasionally breaks through into pockets of diamonds underground,
[01:12:15.074 --> 01:12:17.235]  And they literally shoveled up the diamonds.
[01:12:17.335 --> 01:12:23.578]  They take most of the workers out to the area and they put the diamonds into buckets and they bring them to the surface.
[01:12:25.538 --> 01:12:41.265]  But I've been back, since you went out there, since I last talked to you, I've been back out in South Africa and I've got, you know, I've found things I only heard rumours about and it's really bad inside some of the minds
[01:12:42.998 --> 01:12:57.926]  What I discovered was that, this is new, what I discovered was that inside some of the biggest mines in South Africa, De Beers gets exemption from normal practices, normal health and safety practices.
[01:12:58.526 --> 01:13:01.588]  It says the dust inside its mines is harmless.
[01:13:02.768 --> 01:13:12.053]  Like normally when someone goes down in the mine to mine copper or nickel, they have to have a hose pipe and spray the rock face in front of them with water
[01:13:12.748 --> 01:13:19.954]  The catch all the dust, all the dangerous dust, the silica especially, because that gives silicosis, it cuts your lungs to ribbons.
[01:13:22.316 --> 01:13:27.740]  Well, De Beers says, oh no, it doesn't happen in our mines, it's the same trend, they don't have to use any water.
[01:13:28.701 --> 01:13:31.763]  Mine dust, they tell the government in South Africa, is harmless.
[01:13:33.905 --> 01:13:42.152]  Well, one day I was in a De Beers mine and a shop steward turned to me and said, do you know, Jan, we sometimes
[01:13:43.425 --> 01:13:46.146]  Mining the diamonds directly out of asbestos.
[01:13:47.227 --> 01:13:51.109]  We're only given a cloth to cover our mouths, and we've got to keep that same cloth for a year.
[01:13:51.929 --> 01:13:54.851]  Now for those that don't know... 90 years and a bit of cloth over the mouth.
[01:13:55.171 --> 01:13:57.452]  For those that don't know, asbestos is a mineral.
[01:13:58.152 --> 01:14:03.415]  And it has little tiny hooks and destroys the lungs, and diamonds routinely are mined out of asbestos beds.
[01:14:04.396 --> 01:14:11.659]  It happens that asbestos rock, Christ's Light, is found in the same place that they find diamonds.
[01:14:12.059 --> 01:14:12.940]  Exactly the same place.
[01:14:14.136 --> 01:14:16.057]  And what it is, is fine needles.
[01:14:16.117 --> 01:14:23.081]  It's needles that you breathe in, and they cut into your lungs, and they give you a horrifying death.
[01:14:23.282 --> 01:14:36.209]  And they have these poor Africans down in these deep, deep mines, just breathing in all of this, and they, as you said, can coat things with water, and this wouldn't happen, but they just don't care, because they're so ruthless.
[01:14:36.289 --> 01:14:43.654]  One mine worker, and I knocked on the doors of mine workers around the township, and knocked on the doors, and I found one in three had damaged lungs.
[01:14:44.617 --> 01:14:46.898]  Many of them are lost parts of a lung or a whole lung.
[01:14:48.379 --> 01:14:53.541]  And one mine worker said to me, Jen, I've worked in copper mines, other mines, and there's always water.
[01:14:54.321 --> 01:15:01.184]  But in diamond mines, I reckon, the only thing I can think of, I might be wrong, but they want it dusty.
[01:15:01.204 --> 01:15:04.246]  They want it full of dust, so we can't see the diamonds.
[01:15:06.147 --> 01:15:08.108]  I couldn't think of any other reason for this to happen.
[01:15:09.828 --> 01:15:13.370]  And one professor, Professor Emeritus of Public Health,
[01:15:14.298 --> 01:15:21.088]  He told me he tested 200 workers coming out of the Premier Dharma Mine, and every single one of them had asbestosis.
[01:15:23.098 --> 01:15:24.358]  You know, it's terrible lung disease.
[01:15:24.458 --> 01:15:27.379]  Well, I want to get into this, but I want to start at the beginning.
[01:15:27.419 --> 01:15:42.823]  I mean, explain to people how the diamond trade works, how you made this international film that just really opened up the big secret that diamonds are semi-precious and it's an artificial scarcity scam set up by the Royal Family and Cecil Rhodes and now De Beers.
[01:15:42.843 --> 01:15:51.745]  I mean, break that down, and then the story of how they told you to shut up and... I got involved in this because I worked for tribal people, Aborigines in Australia, and I went down
[01:15:52.768 --> 01:15:57.072]  I mean, they found the world's biggest diamond deposit on a place where women used to go to pray.
[01:15:57.092 --> 01:16:10.043]  But the history of it, how it started, I mean, that's what first got me into diamonds when I started uncovering this rabbit warren of, you know, riddle of deceit.
[01:16:11.504 --> 01:16:17.169]  When they found these, when diamonds were really rare, they found diamonds literally sparking in the moonlight in Africa.
[01:16:17.935 --> 01:16:24.639]  They hired black workers to crawl along on top of the sand with tin cans around their neck and a gag on their mouth.
[01:16:24.659 --> 01:16:28.161]  They couldn't swallow any diamonds and kind of get away with them.
[01:16:29.622 --> 01:16:34.986]  And they picked up these diamonds and they clinked them into the tins, literally sparking in the moonlight.
[01:16:37.407 --> 01:16:38.308]  And then they got rides.
[01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:43.471]  That's the Rhodes and the other, the Oppenheimers, the Rothschilds.
[01:16:44.711 --> 01:16:46.953]  They were finding so many diamonds that, um,
[01:16:47.987 --> 01:16:49.849]  The price of diamonds was sure to crash.
[01:16:51.450 --> 01:17:01.900]  So Seth Rhodes, the enterprising man, he said to the merchants in Europe, look, you fund me to buy up all the diamond leases in Africa.
[01:17:03.782 --> 01:17:04.803]  You're rich, you can do it.
[01:17:04.823 --> 01:17:05.484]  You can fund me.
[01:17:07.305 --> 01:17:10.148]  And I promise I won't sell the diamonds to anyone else but you.
[01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:11.589]  You just set up your own cartel.
[01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:13.091]  I'll sell to you.
[01:17:15.293 --> 01:17:15.953]  That's what he did.
[01:17:15.993 --> 01:17:28.378]  He bought control of the major diamond finds in Southern Africa, set up the company De Beers, and with a contract to sell all the diamonds produced to the merchants in Europe.
[01:17:28.819 --> 01:17:32.380]  He would put them away in their safes and their vaults, and pretend they're rare.
[01:17:34.781 --> 01:17:40.443]  Later on, one of the workers from one of the London plants, London cutting shops, went out there.
[01:17:40.643 --> 01:17:44.385]  He was Ernest Oppenheimer, and he
[01:17:45.023 --> 01:17:47.345]  As you went out there, Cecil Rhodes just died.
[01:17:47.365 --> 01:17:56.611]  And Oppenheimer had control, he managed to get control both in Europe, over the merchants, and the mines in Southern Africa.
[01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:59.734]  And it came to be as all the strengths he's had ever since.
[01:18:01.575 --> 01:18:03.536]  Other mines have been sabotaged.
[01:18:04.517 --> 01:18:08.280]  In his diaries he says how he buys up farms in order to stop production.
[01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:15.188]  I found game parts put up on top of diamond fields in order that the diamonds can't get mined.
[01:18:16.268 --> 01:18:17.089]  I've been taken there.
[01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:19.270]  I've been told where they are by De Beers geologists.
[01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:23.171]  Oh yes, they use phony environmentalism in the case of Arkansas.
[01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:24.412]  Huge diamond deposits.
[01:18:25.012 --> 01:18:28.633]  They said no, it doesn't matter if you bought that land, the Bull brothers.
[01:18:29.393 --> 01:18:30.954]  Bill Clinton said it's for the earth.
[01:18:32.655 --> 01:18:38.357]  Well, it's been turned into, I went down there, Maffreesboro, south of Little Rock, and it's
[01:18:39.235 --> 01:18:52.981]  You know, I paid what, I think it was something like $7, $7 bucks, and you can actually get a license to dig for a day, and people go down, they dig for a day, and now to go down deeper than 6 foot, and they're going to fill a hole up at the end of the evening.
[01:18:53.001 --> 01:18:56.523]  And that's just one little area, I've been there and dug too.
[01:18:56.543 --> 01:19:02.005]  I know, but all the geology is the same as the pits in South Africa.
[01:19:02.025 --> 01:19:06.447]  It'd be a thousand feet deep, that hole, full of diamonds.
[01:19:07.273 --> 01:19:09.555]  And the question is, why was it never mined properly?
[01:19:10.315 --> 01:19:11.396]  Never mined industrially?
[01:19:11.416 --> 01:19:27.009]  And I talked to people that used to own that place, and they told me how it got sabotaged, and how one night, two or three of their plants, widely separated, all burst into flame, simultaneously, to help sabotage that mine.
[01:19:27.029 --> 01:19:36.396]  And now it's been turned into a national park, it's never been mined commercially, and yet the geology, when I went to Canberra, not Canberra, sorry, I haven't done that,
[01:19:37.389 --> 01:19:39.190]  So Bill Clinton made a national park?
[01:20:08.633 --> 01:20:10.734]  It was National Park before Bill Clinton.
[01:20:10.815 --> 01:20:13.957]  Yeah, but he grabbed the separate area that the Bulls own.
[01:20:13.997 --> 01:20:15.397]  I mean, you're the expert on this.
[01:20:15.438 --> 01:20:17.619]  I just know the back story here locally, yeah?
[01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:19.980]  Yeah.
[01:20:20.401 --> 01:20:21.601]  Yeah.
[01:20:23.343 --> 01:20:28.106]  It is now Canada's mining diamonds, and some other countries are mining them.
[01:20:28.986 --> 01:20:30.908]  But they don't want to spoil the racket.
[01:20:31.108 --> 01:20:34.330]  They don't sell the diamonds any cheaper because, you know,
[01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:36.959]  Stay there.
[01:20:36.979 --> 01:20:38.540]  We're gonna come back after this quick break.
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:40.281]  Glitter and Greed with Janine Roberts.
[01:20:40.782 --> 01:20:41.483]  The new book.
[01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:44.365]  All the latest info at InfoWars.com.
[01:20:44.425 --> 01:20:51.591]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest priced, highest quality, storable food for over a decade.
[01:20:51.751 --> 01:20:55.955]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds four to five people is only $39.95.
[01:20:56.716 --> 01:20:57.757]  That's right.
[01:20:57.997 --> 01:21:00.999]  A one-year supply that feeds four to five people for under $4,000.
[01:21:01.059 --> 01:21:01.400]  That's only
[01:21:04.855 --> 01:21:05.375]  We're good to go.
[01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:23.751]  We're good to go!
[01:21:44.195 --> 01:21:50.597]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:21:50.957 --> 01:21:52.937]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:21:53.597 --> 01:21:54.617]  But who is the enemy?
[01:21:55.158 --> 01:21:55.658]  Bin Laden.
[01:21:55.938 --> 01:21:56.878]  This is his ammo.
[01:21:56.898 --> 01:21:58.298]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:21:58.318 --> 01:21:59.999]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:22:00.299 --> 01:22:07.060]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:07.901]  Some U.S.
[01:22:07.941 --> 01:22:13.562]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:22:14.282 --> 01:22:17.764]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:22:17.784 --> 01:22:19.945]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

[01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:52.186]  People ask how I woke up to the New World Order.
[01:24:52.367 --> 01:24:59.632]  One way was learning when I was like 14 that diamonds were semi-precious, that a militarized crime syndicate controlled it.
[01:24:59.652 --> 01:25:07.618]  They'd send in mercenaries to engage in assassinations, attacks on countries if they were mining their own diamonds.
[01:25:07.738 --> 01:25:09.019]  And now that's mainstream news.
[01:25:11.701 --> 01:25:15.284]  And I grew up watching women do anything for diamonds, just worshipping them.
[01:25:16.065 --> 01:25:17.325]  And it's just crud.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:23.345]  And it's another scam by the Globalist and Cecil Rhodes, who said he was going to set up a world government.
[01:25:23.726 --> 01:25:25.648]  It's the same people, the same story.
[01:25:25.688 --> 01:25:27.910]  Janine Roberts, an amazing lady, Glitter and Greed.
[01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:30.633]  Janine, you've broken down how the scam works.
[01:25:30.653 --> 01:25:38.321]  I'm going to get into the latest stuff, you know, since your film, in the book Glitter and Greed, and also tell folks how to get your film, now on DVD, that you sell.
[01:25:38.341 --> 01:25:40.463]  We'll give out your website, or tell folks where they can get it.
[01:25:42.901 --> 01:25:50.647]  I specifically, though, tell folks what happened when your film was coming out and it was going to air on British, US, and European TV as it did.
[01:25:50.667 --> 01:26:00.094]  I mean, it's not just you talking to people that have been firebombed or attacked or killed or whatever, or them using nature preserves to shut down mines or not let them be exploited.
[01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:05.659]  Yeah, I interviewed a terrorist working for Tobias as well in that film.
[01:26:07.937 --> 01:26:08.697]  Stop right there!
[01:26:08.737 --> 01:26:11.918]  Terrorist working... Stop, stop, stop!
[01:26:11.978 --> 01:26:13.758]  Terrorist working for De Beers.
[01:26:13.818 --> 01:26:14.798]  Explain how that works.
[01:26:16.319 --> 01:26:24.420]  Well, he was employed to ambush Africans who wanted to... If an African can carry a diamond into Europe, he's allowed to do so.
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.540]  It's quite legal.
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:29.741]  If he minds himself, get it to Europe and get international prices from it.
[01:26:29.781 --> 01:26:34.262]  If you walk into Antwerp in Belgium,
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:39.964]  You see signs in the windows saying rough diamonds, that's uncut diamonds, bought here.
[01:26:41.485 --> 01:26:52.594]  But, De Beers is getting all those tainted as if they're not free trade, but they're not individual enterprise, but kind of calling them all blood diamonds, even if the terrorists involved are not.
[01:26:53.635 --> 01:27:00.101]  And what De Beers did then, what it seems they did, I mean, it says it's just a company, Anglo American, that allegedly did this.
[01:27:01.542 --> 01:27:04.064]  This guy we interviewed, we interviewed him in Latin America,
[01:27:08.439 --> 01:27:17.362]  He's been paid to ambush Africans, ambush them, keep them in prison, and he admitted to torturing them.
[01:27:18.683 --> 01:27:25.246]  If they were taking diamonds out that weren't, you know, they should have gone, in government terms, should have gone for the hands of the bears.
[01:27:26.726 --> 01:27:31.168]  He was there to stop the independent merchants, as far as I could see, to terrorize them.
[01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:33.337]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:52.050]  Total Cartel.
[01:27:53.751 --> 01:27:58.874]  You see a movie like Blood Diamond, they do reverse propaganda, very complex really.
[01:27:59.654 --> 01:28:11.562]  They admit there's a secret cartel controlling diamonds, but they imply that they're the ones running Blood Diamonds that the individual Africans can smuggle out, when it's actually the big cartel that wants to stop the Africans.
[01:28:12.302 --> 01:28:24.011]  Aboriginals of Australia to have their diamonds and so liberals go and feel all good and Hollywood does and oh we're fighting for Africa but in reality they're working for the big cartels that have brought all this hell.
[01:28:24.871 --> 01:28:25.592]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:25.612 --> 01:28:28.834]  Tobias used to have to have lots of puppet schoolboys from England.
[01:28:28.854 --> 01:28:35.699]  They used to send them out to Africa with a big budget to buy up these diamonds so they wouldn't go on international market and undercut Tobias' diamonds.
[01:28:36.567 --> 01:28:42.250]  But now what they do is they label 9 out of 10 diamonds that they label as blood diamonds and spot them trying to be traded.
[01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:44.251]  More than 9 out of 10.
[01:28:44.311 --> 01:28:47.173]  It's more like 90 out of, who knows, 99 out of 100.
[01:28:47.273 --> 01:28:49.574]  And nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:28:49.594 --> 01:28:55.977]  They're all to do with keeping their mouth on the hands of independent Africans so they can't trade for themselves.
[01:28:56.377 --> 01:29:02.541]  That's why all the diamonds nearly are taken out of Africa and cut in other countries by De Beers.
[01:29:02.561 --> 01:29:05.142]  A lot go to Israel.
[01:29:05.723 --> 01:29:06.223]  We're good to go.
[01:29:29.438 --> 01:29:32.440]  Get them on their own feet, so they can stand up and sort of trade properly.
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:33.741]  Absolutely.
[01:29:33.781 --> 01:29:34.721]  They don't know how to do it.
[01:29:34.761 --> 01:29:36.723]  Their diamonds get taken out of the country.
[01:29:37.043 --> 01:29:37.483]  Okay.
[01:29:37.783 --> 01:29:40.185]  When we come back, we've got a breaking and long segment, Janine.
[01:29:40.565 --> 01:29:49.150]  I want to tell a story about what happened to you physically, right as your film was coming out, and how they tried to intimidate you, because that, again, goes directly to the heart of what we're facing.
[01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:56.775]  And then the latest info, as your investigations continue, Glitter and Greed, the secret world of the diamond cartel.
[01:29:57.655 --> 01:29:58.276]  I want to talk about
[01:29:59.341 --> 01:30:00.603]  How long have you been doing this?
[01:30:01.444 --> 01:30:03.566]  In fact, briefly, how long have you been investigating this?
[01:30:04.928 --> 01:30:07.871]  About 20 years.
[01:30:07.891 --> 01:30:08.251]  20 years?
[01:30:08.271 --> 01:30:09.072]  I started in 1976. 1970?
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:13.780]  Six.
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:14.361]  Thirty years.
[01:30:14.841 --> 01:30:15.561]  Thirty years.
[01:30:16.522 --> 01:30:17.423]  Goodness gracious.
[01:30:17.543 --> 01:30:18.343]  Thirty years.
[01:30:18.383 --> 01:30:19.083]  Just amazing.
[01:30:19.604 --> 01:30:20.164]  Since 1976.
[01:30:21.105 --> 01:30:21.925]  More than thirty years.
[01:30:22.425 --> 01:30:23.786]  Okay, Janine Roberts, stay there.
[01:30:23.806 --> 01:30:24.347]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:24.607 --> 01:30:31.211]  Folks, give this book to the women in your life who've got to have diamonds, so they'll understand just what a fraud it is.
[01:30:31.311 --> 01:30:31.811]  Stay with us.
[01:30:34.873 --> 01:30:35.773]  We're on the march.
[01:30:36.274 --> 01:30:37.875]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:38.795 --> 01:30:41.477]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:46.901]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:30:47.201 --> 01:30:48.362]  eFoods does it again.

[01:30:53.686 --> 01:31:01.833]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.

[01:31:19.485 --> 01:31:24.589]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:26.130]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[01:31:26.311 --> 01:31:28.672]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[01:31:28.712 --> 01:31:29.893]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:31:29.913 --> 01:31:31.154]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:31:44.739 --> 01:31:50.224]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:31:50.464 --> 01:31:51.765]  And we knew what to do.
[01:31:51.785 --> 01:31:53.547]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:31:53.787 --> 01:32:00.212]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:32:00.813 --> 01:32:09.340]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:16.506]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:32:16.806 --> 01:32:19.867]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:32:19.987 --> 01:32:25.189]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:28.390]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:35.552]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:32:38.615 --> 01:32:39.758]  This is the government-sponsored terror.
[01:32:40.199 --> 01:32:42.686]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:32:44.153 --> 01:32:48.975]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from HempUSA.org.
[01:32:49.195 --> 01:32:57.598]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[01:32:57.818 --> 01:33:02.500]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:09.262]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[01:33:09.802 --> 01:33:16.007]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[01:33:16.187 --> 01:33:30.818]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins, with extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables, and fruits, improve taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[01:33:32.119 --> 01:33:35.662]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[01:33:35.882 --> 01:33:37.904]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:33:37.924 --> 01:33:38.324]  That's 908-691-2608.
[01:33:38.344 --> 01:33:40.546]  Yeah, Jared in there directing the show with Rob.
[01:33:53.325 --> 01:33:57.327]  As we simulcast the radio show on TV via PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:58.287 --> 01:34:01.069]  The Secret World of the Diamond Cartel, Glitter and Greed.
[01:34:01.349 --> 01:34:04.950]  He was saying, hey, 20 bucks, this book pays for itself.
[01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:09.232]  You just give this to your wife or girlfriend and she understands she's being suckered.
[01:34:09.252 --> 01:34:12.194]  I mean, if they'll read this book, they'll understand it.
[01:34:12.354 --> 01:34:19.457]  Or, if they go to Janine Roberts' website and buy a copy of the DVD, you should want to watch it in high quality.
[01:34:19.477 --> 01:34:20.318]  It's also on the web.
[01:34:21.523 --> 01:34:22.764]  I didn't get a DVD from my website.
[01:34:47.392 --> 01:35:05.301]  The Diamond website, I've got a number of websites, and they can email me, they can email, very simple, jan, J-A-N, at, Janine Roberts, that's my name, J-A-N-I-N-E, R-O-B-E-R-T-S, dot com.
[01:35:05.962 --> 01:35:08.343]  But let's go, I mean there's also a website though, isn't there?
[01:35:08.683 --> 01:35:12.725]  Yes there is, it's www.sparkle.plus,
[01:35:17.305 --> 01:35:20.628]  So it's sparkle.plus.com.
[01:35:20.828 --> 01:35:21.849]  And we've got it up on screen.
[01:35:21.909 --> 01:35:24.091]  Okay, let's move quickly because I want to take some calls too.
[01:35:24.772 --> 01:35:27.454]  Specifically, you got some heat for putting this film out.
[01:35:28.035 --> 01:35:29.857]  Tell folks what happened right as it was coming out.
[01:35:30.137 --> 01:35:31.158]  I had five bad phases.
[01:35:31.838 --> 01:35:37.203]  A sexual assault and my cheekbones were broken, my nose was broken, damaged eye.
[01:35:38.584 --> 01:35:40.226]  Yeah, I was two months in the hospital.
[01:35:40.286 --> 01:35:42.368]  I was critically ill for two weeks.
[01:35:43.973 --> 01:35:51.556]  Well, Janine, I was talking over to you, asking the question, can you start over and specifically tell folks the story, how it happened, what they said to you?
[01:35:52.857 --> 01:36:08.563]  I was, um, the head of the biz was putting pressure on the BBC, who was helping me make the film, and then one night, a gang broke into my home, there was three of them,
[01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:14.600]  Uh, they sexually assaulted me, but I fought them off, that part of it.
[01:36:15.781 --> 01:36:18.203]  And then they just used me as a punch bag.
[01:36:18.664 --> 01:36:25.529]  They broke my face up, broke my cheekbone, broke my nose, broke my eyelids and my good eye.
[01:36:25.549 --> 01:36:26.970]  The other eye's lazy.
[01:36:28.391 --> 01:36:31.413]  Um, I finished up, got complications.
[01:36:31.553 --> 01:36:37.798]  I was critically ill in the hospital for two weeks and I was two months in hospital altogether.
[01:36:38.934 --> 01:36:44.437]  And while I was critically ill, they had lawyers come into the hospital to try to grab control over my film.
[01:36:44.457 --> 01:36:47.659]  And it was pretty tough at the time.
[01:36:48.559 --> 01:36:56.143]  Now specifically, going from memory here, didn't the gang, while they were pounding you, tell you to not make the, you know, not release the film?
[01:36:56.163 --> 01:37:05.208]  No, they'd use personal insults, and they, they, it was the way, next day, the lawyers came and demanded control over the film.
[01:37:05.228 --> 01:37:07.809]  It was like a, there was me all black and blue,
[01:37:08.624 --> 01:37:12.066]  And I was ambushed by lawyers who claimed to got some rights, but it didn't.
[01:37:12.086 --> 01:37:14.867]  I had no rights.
[01:37:14.887 --> 01:37:16.288]  And they wanted control.
[01:37:17.008 --> 01:37:24.472]  And I later heard they put pressure on the BBC from the highest level to try to get me dropped as producer of the film.
[01:37:24.532 --> 01:37:28.114]  And when my name still stayed on the film, they threatened the BBC.
[01:37:31.035 --> 01:37:36.318]  But my film was never found libelous, no legal actions against it, but there were threats aplenty.
[01:37:37.498 --> 01:37:41.760]  I've now got rights back to it, but it took me a real battle.
[01:37:42.581 --> 01:37:43.841]  I showed it just the same.
[01:37:43.961 --> 01:37:53.166]  I came over, I was invited to Congress, to a congressional hearing in Washington, to talk about diamonds and human rights, and the film was seen by congressmen.
[01:37:55.007 --> 01:38:01.350]  And I was invited to the Arctic Wastes of Canada to show it to the mine workers at finding diamonds in Canada too.
[01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:07.306]  Yeah, so I got my credit back to it, but it was a very tough time.
[01:38:09.168 --> 01:38:11.690]  But your film now has aired in quite a few parts of the world.
[01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:12.690]  I know I saw it on TV.
[01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:19.956]  It has aired, yes, and the DVD is the longer version of the film.
[01:38:20.456 --> 01:38:24.860]  The one on the internet is the shorter version, but the longer version, high quality.
[01:38:26.368 --> 01:38:29.989]  That's the one that's on the DVD, so that's not available on the internet at the moment.
[01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:30.550]  Yes, yes.
[01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:30.870]  Well, good.
[01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:31.830]  People should get the DVD.
[01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:35.552]  You went through hell to make this, and it's your type of courage.
[01:38:35.592 --> 01:38:37.993]  It's a testament to the human spirit.
[01:38:38.013 --> 01:38:43.475]  I mean, now it is widely known that diamonds are semi-precious and a scam, and they've lost... Well, that started the whole thing.
[01:38:43.575 --> 01:38:50.818]  I fenced on the United States clean diamond debt, but unfortunately, they only went for diamonds produced by rebels.
[01:38:51.846 --> 01:38:59.788]  Tonight there was a mine in the Congo where Amnesty International reported that there were bodies floating down the river outside the mine.
[01:38:59.828 --> 01:39:02.389]  Their children were in the prison inside a diamond mine.
[01:39:03.269 --> 01:39:10.370]  And diamonds from there were being sold as clean to the United States because they weren't produced by rebels.
[01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:15.392]  They were produced by a government company in cooperation with the De Beers, who partly owned it.
[01:39:17.092 --> 01:39:17.752]  So they were clean.
[01:39:18.272 --> 01:39:20.573]  So that's what human rights violations are going on.
[01:39:21.337 --> 01:39:24.920]  Yeah, they blame their own actions on anybody else that wants to mine diamonds.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:27.421]  I've read that they've lost some of their monopoly.
[01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:30.523]  What, they have about 90% of the world diamond monopoly now?
[01:39:31.884 --> 01:39:33.205]  They've got less than that.
[01:39:33.606 --> 01:39:45.054]  But it doesn't matter, because everyone else, all the other major producers, are tamely following along behind De Beers, profiting from the high prices that De Beers maintains by force.
[01:39:46.094 --> 01:39:48.236]  So the other guys are not challenging them.
[01:39:48.256 --> 01:39:49.777]  They're not trying to undercut them.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.121]  Alright, let's...
[01:40:05.819 --> 01:40:10.620]  Okay, let's get into the new information you cover in Glitter and Green and a new investigation that isn't even in the book.
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:12.121]  Cover your latest info.
[01:40:12.161 --> 01:40:28.325]  You already told us about the asbestos mineral that the diamonds are mined out of and they're not allowed to... Yes, I was out in South Africa about a year ago and I talked to all the doctors and I got definite proof and I found a white woman who is a health and safety officer.
[01:40:28.385 --> 01:40:34.487]  She only had to go down the mine twice a week and you can't pick her children up now from the damage to her lungs.
[01:40:36.061 --> 01:40:40.042]  She's just, you know, she's a fit woman and she's just, um, it's very tragic.
[01:40:40.102 --> 01:40:42.683]  She's lost part of one of the lungs.
[01:40:42.843 --> 01:40:46.404]  She got deceased in the lungs from the asbestos dust.
[01:40:47.344 --> 01:40:51.365]  And all she was going down, I think she spent two afternoons every week inside the mine.
[01:40:52.525 --> 01:40:58.146]  And I've seen her x-rays and see how within a year damage was showing up within her, on her x-rays.
[01:40:59.287 --> 01:41:04.948]  And so if that happens to me, one of the supervisors, what about the workers that are down there every day for eight hours or more?
[01:41:07.292 --> 01:41:08.793]  I know, I know.
[01:41:09.994 --> 01:41:11.055]  It's greed.
[01:41:11.075 --> 01:41:12.436]  It's pure greed.
[01:41:13.136 --> 01:41:16.338]  They mine these diamonds for less than $5 a carat.
[01:41:17.099 --> 01:41:17.919]  That's what they pay.
[01:41:17.939 --> 01:41:19.980]  $5 a carat.
[01:41:20.721 --> 01:41:24.583]  Then they sell a carat of diamonds for $20,000 in the United States.
[01:41:26.525 --> 01:41:30.968]  I've seen eight-year-old children cutting diamonds in India.
[01:41:33.389 --> 01:41:36.111]  I've seen these children sleeping on the floor of the workshops.
[01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:41.979]  Um, with a kind of toothbrush stuck to the side of the spinning wheel.
[01:41:42.911 --> 01:41:50.416]  No safety precautions, nothing to stop the dust, the corrosive dust from the ground diamond going straight into their lungs.
[01:41:50.756 --> 01:41:53.058]  And this is how the psychological warfare works.
[01:41:53.538 --> 01:41:58.521]  So women and men can keep buying and they go, oh, there's bad diamonds and there's good diamonds.
[01:41:58.881 --> 01:42:03.084]  And then they blame all their evil activity on the bad diamond people when that's really them.
[01:42:03.104 --> 01:42:05.205]  And then women still go out and buy them.
[01:42:05.225 --> 01:42:08.007]  I think the answer is don't buy these dirty things.
[01:42:08.837 --> 01:42:14.359]  No, I think, you know, what I'd like to see, if I'm being honest, is what I'd like to see is major reform.
[01:42:14.379 --> 01:42:26.565]  I'd like to see them have certificates and come out of Diamondsworth's International Inspectorate to make sure that the mine's working properly and the cutters are ethical, you know, decent conditions.
[01:42:26.745 --> 01:42:30.907]  But the bankers will just buy that, will just control the International Inspectorate.
[01:42:30.927 --> 01:42:32.107]  I mean, who set up the UN?
[01:42:32.447 --> 01:42:34.948]  Was the Cecil Rhodes Combine?
[01:42:34.968 --> 01:42:37.309]  It needs to be something really independent.
[01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.990]  It needs to be new.
[01:42:38.670 --> 01:42:39.190]  I agree with you.
[01:42:39.210 --> 01:42:43.733]  Well, we need to have... People need to fund, you know, their own investigative foundations.
[01:42:43.853 --> 01:42:48.136]  But, see, the people don't have the money to go out and do investigations and expose it.
[01:42:48.756 --> 01:42:53.659]  And, uh... Just like with organic food, then it would get that trusted group certification.
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:57.462]  Can I mention another book coming out this year?
[01:42:57.782 --> 01:42:58.122]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:58.142 --> 01:42:58.842]  Tell us the latest.
[01:42:58.862 --> 01:43:00.543]  You said you're working on new investigations.
[01:43:00.583 --> 01:43:00.804]  Yes.
[01:43:00.884 --> 01:43:03.385]  Yeah, it's a book called Fear of the Invisible.
[01:43:04.186 --> 01:43:06.327]  And it's into the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:10.752]  The same thing that Dick Cheney heads up, partly.
[01:43:11.432 --> 01:43:36.689]  Well, we want to get you back on about... I've been looking at the drugs that have been sold, I've been looking at childhood vaccines, autism, and all that stuff that gets, you know, children can't go to school unless they've had these injections, and I've got transcripts out of Washington, D.C., that haven't seen the light of day before, of a top British and American scientist meeting together
[01:43:37.844 --> 01:43:41.307]  Well, for those that don't know, I don't know about your investigation, but separately, even ABC News,
[01:44:03.641 --> 01:44:31.293]  In 2004, reported when Congress, Congressman Dan Burton went in and had the document seized, the high-level CDC and FDA meetings, where they said, do not give it to your grandchildren, do not give it to your children, millions have been brain damaged from the mercury alone and other things, the cancer virus is all of it, we cannot let the public know, they will lynch us, and so they contend... In my book, the very first time I show how these things are made,
[01:44:32.203 --> 01:44:59.177]  I go right through it, really carefully ask all the questions, because when I... What happened here, I was over in the United Kingdom, and my brother phoned me up and told me that his neighbours, in the same, you know, same... They've got a brain damaged child, just after having an MMR vaccination, and they wanted... He said, you call yourself an investigative journalist, has the government been hiding anything from us?
[01:45:00.168 --> 01:45:02.669]  Well, to be honest, at that point I hadn't got a clue.
[01:45:03.449 --> 01:45:04.609]  I hadn't been looking into it.
[01:45:04.689 --> 01:45:06.670]  I'd been believing what the doctors told me.
[01:45:06.690 --> 01:45:14.031]  And, but I've, you know, I've gone into it as deeply as I can, just like I've done on diamonds.
[01:45:15.412 --> 01:45:18.292]  And I've uncovered a can of worms.
[01:45:18.613 --> 01:45:21.493]  You know, it's just, I'm staggered.
[01:45:21.573 --> 01:45:22.794]  I'm just horrified.
[01:45:22.814 --> 01:45:22.854]  Um,
[01:45:25.103 --> 01:45:38.550]  You know, I'm happy to say that my daughter hasn't had my grandchild vaccinated and my daughter wasn't vaccinated.
[01:45:38.850 --> 01:45:45.974]  The meeting was chaired by the World Health Organization at the NIH in Washington, D.C.
[01:45:47.295 --> 01:45:54.459]  And what they found, what the woman had to say was that chicken leukemia virus was in the MMR vaccine.
[01:45:56.434 --> 01:45:58.736]  They've lowered the standards by a hundred times.
[01:46:12.751 --> 01:46:15.574]  And the manufacturers cannot purify the vaccines.
[01:46:16.034 --> 01:46:20.738]  I'd always imagined a vaccine was a sterile fluid with sterile ingredients.
[01:46:20.778 --> 01:46:24.321]  No, it's filled with hundreds of different DNA fragments and cancer viruses.
[01:46:24.641 --> 01:46:25.782]  That's totally right.
[01:46:25.883 --> 01:46:27.564]  DNA fragments, RNA fragments.
[01:46:27.944 --> 01:46:30.226]  Some of the cyanotic prions might be in there too.
[01:46:30.387 --> 01:46:32.268]  And by the way, this is in all their own documents.
[01:46:33.269 --> 01:46:35.051]  This is official documents.
[01:46:35.111 --> 01:46:37.313]  You know, after this stuff's found,
[01:46:38.368 --> 01:46:44.030]  I found fraud in the documents on HIV from the CDC.
[01:46:44.491 --> 01:46:46.011]  Ma'am, I have the government documents.
[01:46:46.031 --> 01:46:46.952]  Yeah, that's from the vaccines.
[01:46:47.372 --> 01:46:48.692]  I have the government documents.
[01:46:48.933 --> 01:46:51.494]  And this is, you can Google this, it's on major websites.
[01:46:52.634 --> 01:46:56.356]  Over 200 million Americans... It's called fearoftheinvisible.com.
[01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:57.816]  Fearoftheinvisible.com, that's the...
[01:47:02.375 --> 01:47:02.655]  Okay.
[01:47:03.056 --> 01:47:09.821]  Well, I mean, did you know... I've got now two strands to my arm where I've done really, you know, major work.
[01:47:10.161 --> 01:47:13.964]  Diamonds and viruses and all those diseases.
[01:47:14.304 --> 01:47:16.926]  Well, did you know that... They're scaring us.
[01:47:17.367 --> 01:47:19.648]  They try to scare you into buying stuff.
[01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.349]  Yeah.
[01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:29.336]  Did you know that the HV-40 monkey virus... That's what started me.
[01:47:29.396 --> 01:47:32.018]  I was flown by a British television channel to
[01:47:33.058 --> 01:47:45.908]  I attended an emergency workshop in the 1990s at the National Institutes of Health, and it was about simian phallus 40, ESP40, being in the polio vaccine.
[01:47:46.909 --> 01:47:50.351]  So I thought, well, how on earth do some monkey phallus get into the polio vaccine?
[01:47:50.412 --> 01:47:53.994]  And I find out that it's grown on dead monkeys.
[01:47:54.014 --> 01:47:55.816]  Their kidneys?
[01:47:56.156 --> 01:47:56.977]  They kill monkeys.
[01:47:57.017 --> 01:48:01.140]  They take their kidneys and their testicles, because they can get to those two things easy.
[01:48:02.458 --> 01:48:02.998]  We're good to go.
[01:48:17.742 --> 01:48:19.123]  And that's what goes into the vaccine.
[01:48:19.163 --> 01:48:30.568]  In fact, the leading British expert at this international meeting at the NIH, this is an official record, he said at one period there were more monkey phalluses in the polio vaccine than there were polio phalluses.
[01:48:31.289 --> 01:48:44.035]  And then 200 million Americans were given that and they confirm it's caused hundreds of millions of cases of the formerly rare cancers caused by the virus and now...
[01:48:45.055 --> 01:48:49.817]  Now it's just, there's kids dying everywhere, leukemia, dying everywhere, cancer.
[01:48:49.877 --> 01:49:12.545]  Actually, I watched a cover-up, because I was one of the two scientific journalists that actually sat through all the tests in the laboratories from all over the world reporting that, and then they had a press conference at the end for the press that were lazy, they didn't listen to the scientists directly, and one of the scientists hadn't spoken out during the meetings,
[01:49:13.283 --> 01:49:15.144]  He told the press that he would give it to his children.
[01:49:16.545 --> 01:49:19.647]  Yeah, so you... And that was totally misleading.
[01:49:19.847 --> 01:49:39.159]  Yeah, you go to the meetings, you go to the meetings, you go to the meetings, and you hear him admit it's killing everybody, and then they go out of the... I mean, what we've got now, we've put, in the flu vaccine, we've put mercury, a neurotoxin, and what do we do to our senior citizens who are getting brain diseases, dementia?
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:42.141]  We give them mercury every year in the flu vaccine.
[01:49:42.386 --> 01:49:43.206]  Which causes that?
[01:49:43.947 --> 01:49:45.207]  Which causes brain damage?
[01:49:45.608 --> 01:49:49.230]  Yes, well they admit that... I mean, I just can't believe the insanity of this.
[01:49:49.650 --> 01:49:52.331]  Well, it's eugenics, ma'am, and I'm glad you've done this.
[01:49:52.351 --> 01:49:54.532]  And by the way, you're an incredible person.
[01:49:54.592 --> 01:49:57.754]  You're an activist, journalist, author, and award-winning filmmaker.
[01:49:57.774 --> 01:50:01.936]  Janine Roberts has over 30 years of work focusing on mainly environmental and human rights issues.
[01:50:01.956 --> 01:50:07.319]  She's written five books, the Mampoon Books, three volumes of the story of aboriginal communities.
[01:50:07.819 --> 01:50:21.884]  Armed mercenaries and mining corporations, Jack of Cape Grim, the extraordinary story of Aboriginal resistance, how a group held out against three military expeditions, massacres to mining, the colonization of Aboriginal Australia.
[01:50:21.924 --> 01:50:25.465]  So you've been in the bush, Africa, in Australia.
[01:50:25.505 --> 01:50:29.187]  You have really been on the front lines and it goes on and on and on.
[01:50:30.007 --> 01:50:34.549]  But let me just, in case you don't know, or find out if you do know, we have all the government documents.
[01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:37.990]  You've gone to one level, or maybe I haven't given you a chance to go to the next.
[01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:39.850]  This is all eugenics, ma'am.
[01:50:40.210 --> 01:50:44.792]  By design, they're putting soft kill bio agents.
[01:50:45.666 --> 01:50:59.019]  Which debilitate and are hard to track while you're dying through the microplasms, through the DNA, artificially engineered viruses is what you can call them, it's really a nanotech, through the mercury, through the monkey viruses.
[01:50:59.039 --> 01:51:01.502]  The monkey virus is the 60-year-old bioweapon.
[01:51:02.443 --> 01:51:05.286]  And the Rockefellers who funded Hitler, they're all behind this.
[01:51:05.446 --> 01:51:05.926]  IBM.
[01:51:06.727 --> 01:51:08.189]  Are you aware of that level of this?
[01:51:09.304 --> 01:51:15.847]  I'm aware of all the cor- I'm aware of just how many- I mean, I know that Dick Cheney's, uh, was the CEO of one of the companies making this.
[01:51:16.747 --> 01:51:21.470]  I now know they're wanting our children to have a cervical cancer vaccine, HPV.
[01:51:21.810 --> 01:51:22.570]  That's killing people.
[01:51:22.590 --> 01:51:26.972]  I mean, it's killed 20, so far, from official records.
[01:51:27.552 --> 01:51:30.333]  And it's, uh, they haven't found a virus.
[01:51:30.474 --> 01:51:31.214]  It's only proteins.
[01:51:31.234 --> 01:51:33.255]  They haven't actually got the virus in the test tube.
[01:51:34.095 --> 01:51:34.715]  They can't grow it.
[01:51:34.735 --> 01:51:35.676]  They can't pierce it there.
[01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:37.271]  It's ridiculous.
[01:51:37.551 --> 01:51:38.072]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:51:38.092 --> 01:51:43.118]  Let's take a few calls on the other side with our guest, Glitter and Greed, Janine Roberts.
[01:51:43.379 --> 01:51:44.600]  Get it at Infowars.com.
[01:51:45.061 --> 01:51:50.528]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:51:50.568 --> 01:51:51.089]  and the world.
[01:51:51.349 --> 01:51:54.633]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:51:54.633 --> 01:51:54.833]  I think so.
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:16.383]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.

[01:52:40.981 --> 01:52:50.388]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:52:50.748 --> 01:52:52.410]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:52:53.382 --> 01:52:54.403]  But who is the enemy?
[01:52:54.923 --> 01:52:55.423]  Bin Laden.
[01:52:55.723 --> 01:52:56.704]  This is his M.O.
[01:52:56.724 --> 01:52:58.024]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:52:58.044 --> 01:52:59.745]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:53:00.085 --> 01:53:06.829]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:53:07.229 --> 01:53:07.669]  Some U.S.
[01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:13.392]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:53:14.052 --> 01:53:17.513]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:53:17.533 --> 01:53:19.714]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:53:43.826 --> 01:53:47.428]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:53:47.528 --> 01:53:53.171]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:53:53.271 --> 01:53:57.313]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:53:57.593 --> 01:53:59.895]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:54:00.055 --> 01:54:06.038]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:54:06.118 --> 01:54:06.658]  We're good to go!
[01:54:35.302 --> 01:54:37.663]  GoldenFLAX.com or call 800-387-5516.
[01:54:37.723 --> 01:54:37.903]  That's 800-387-5516.
[01:54:37.943 --> 01:54:38.644]  Free shipping included.
[01:54:38.684 --> 01:54:40.105]  He's pounding down, loaded up and trucking.
[01:54:40.145 --> 01:54:41.485]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[01:54:59.418 --> 01:55:09.124]  We are back live.
[01:55:09.685 --> 01:55:17.770]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:21.392]  We want to keep Jeanine Roberts five minutes to the next hour.
[01:55:21.412 --> 01:55:26.536]  Another ten minutes we can take your calls from Robert and Alex and a few others specifically that have questions for her.
[01:55:28.356 --> 01:55:30.919]  You know, you hear her trying to warn people, I'm trying to warn people.
[01:55:31.039 --> 01:55:33.842]  You learn about diamonds, it goes into another thing, into another thing.
[01:55:34.763 --> 01:55:36.365]  We keep buying into their scams.
[01:55:36.465 --> 01:55:40.810]  Their carbon tax scam, their diamond scam, their vaccine scam.
[01:55:41.771 --> 01:55:42.892]  And these are scam artists.
[01:55:42.912 --> 01:55:47.498]  I mean, that's how John D. Rockefeller's father made his money, was a snake oil salesman.
[01:55:47.958 --> 01:55:54.884]  He'd go around going, this will cure your ails, this will grow your hair, make you live longer, make you get up early in the morning.
[01:55:55.685 --> 01:55:58.247]  And it was really opium and cocaine mixed together.
[01:55:59.188 --> 01:56:00.449]  That's mainly what snake oil was.
[01:56:00.509 --> 01:56:03.692]  I guess it would cure your ails for at least a little while until you ran out of it.
[01:56:06.134 --> 01:56:06.834]  This is what they're doing.
[01:56:06.854 --> 01:56:09.256]  We're going to be covering vaccines next hour with a guest.
[01:56:09.276 --> 01:56:11.959]  So you'll want to stay with us for that.
[01:56:11.999 --> 01:56:13.160]  We've got Barbara Lowe Fisher.
[01:56:14.501 --> 01:56:20.102]  Joining us, one of the heads of the major groups exposing vaccines, but let's take a call from Robert in Canada.
[01:56:20.122 --> 01:56:21.263]  You're on the air with Janine Roberts.
[01:56:21.303 --> 01:56:21.663]  Go ahead.
[01:56:21.683 --> 01:56:23.643]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:24.724 --> 01:56:24.964]  Hello.
[01:56:25.804 --> 01:56:26.304]  Alex, you there?
[01:56:26.644 --> 01:56:27.044]  Yes, I am.
[01:56:28.084 --> 01:56:28.384]  Oh, good.
[01:56:28.845 --> 01:56:37.787]  Before I start, Alex, I just wanted to say, I've been listening now for about a year and change, off and on, but more dedicated in the past half year, and you are a warrior in the fight.
[01:56:39.627 --> 01:56:42.288]  You're a strong, a conic, you're Conan in the fight, man.
[01:56:43.789 --> 01:56:45.670]  Man, all I'm doing is exposing scams.
[01:56:45.730 --> 01:56:47.150]  I'll tell you, Janine Roberts, Conan.
[01:56:48.451 --> 01:56:52.292]  Well, I can only tell you, Alex, it takes a lot of balls to do what you've got to do, especially if you've got kids at home.
[01:56:52.332 --> 01:57:01.336]  I mean, like, especially living down there in Texas, which is the nest of vipers, right?
[01:57:01.516 --> 01:57:05.858]  Well, look, we don't have a future if we don't stand up.
[01:57:05.918 --> 01:57:08.859]  We'd become enslaved because we don't stand up.
[01:57:08.879 --> 01:57:09.199]  Janine?
[01:57:09.219 --> 01:57:10.680]  That's right.
[01:57:11.957 --> 01:57:14.899]  I went out to get myself in hot water all the time.
[01:57:14.919 --> 01:57:18.220]  I mean, I got my tyres spiked a year ago.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:20.982]  I was in Israel, West Bank, Palestine.
[01:57:21.922 --> 01:57:24.504]  And it was Israelis that spiked my tyres.
[01:57:25.244 --> 01:57:26.045]  Both my front tyres.
[01:57:27.425 --> 01:57:31.748]  And the thing was, I stopped to talk to a Palestinian farmer, and they decided I must be a bad one.
[01:57:33.469 --> 01:57:34.429]  So they spiked my wheels.
[01:57:34.449 --> 01:57:39.032]  I mean, it's... You see what other people have to put up with, you know.
[01:57:39.612 --> 01:57:40.552]  I'm reporting it.
[01:57:40.733 --> 01:57:41.273]  I get there.
[01:57:50.586 --> 01:57:51.026]  Absolutely.
[01:57:51.046 --> 01:57:51.906]  Anything else, Robert?
[01:57:52.426 --> 01:57:59.308]  Well, my question actually was, you were speaking earlier about how they closed down this mine in the United States when they discovered these diamonds.
[01:58:00.109 --> 01:58:02.389]  How did they ever allow the Canadian mines to open then?
[01:58:02.449 --> 01:58:04.950]  Because, you know, I did some research into it.
[01:58:05.210 --> 01:58:07.371]  Apparently 60% of it's owned by Rio Tinto.
[01:58:07.995 --> 01:58:13.560]  In Australia, and the rest is a guy by the name of Harry Winston, is it?
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:19.086]  Yeah, Harry Winston Enterprises, which is actually based in... Alright, we'll let her answer that, go ahead.
[01:58:19.206 --> 01:58:31.037]  With Rear Tinted Sink, RT said, that was one of my first targets, my book about, book called Massacres to Mining, an earlier book of mine was all about Rear Tinted Sink.
[01:58:32.190 --> 01:58:38.275]  Now, they operate with utter ruthlessness towards tribal peoples, Americans, Indians, whoever they are.
[01:58:39.315 --> 01:58:44.739]  I was up there, I was asked up to Yellowknife to advise the people up there.
[01:58:45.059 --> 01:58:57.008]  My film, the local environmentalists wanted to put my film on in Yellowknife, and De Beers brought in the lawyers and told them they couldn't show the film.
[01:58:57.929 --> 01:59:00.611]  It was front page headlines in the local newspaper,
[01:59:02.114 --> 01:59:02.975]  And they insisted.
[01:59:02.995 --> 01:59:09.199]  They flew me up there and put it on in the biggest cinema in town.
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:12.521]  And I was kept there speaking afterwards for two hours.
[01:59:12.541 --> 01:59:13.802]  All right, stay there.
[01:59:13.822 --> 01:59:16.104]  Janine, we got a break.
[01:59:16.244 --> 01:59:16.744]  One minute break.
[01:59:16.764 --> 01:59:21.768]  We'll come back with five final minutes with you so you can finish up what you were just saying so we can talk to Alex in Florida.
[01:59:21.808 --> 01:59:22.308]  Stay with us.
[01:59:22.348 --> 01:59:23.369]  Fourth hour straight ahead.
[01:59:26.611 --> 01:59:28.213]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:59:29.113 --> 01:59:31.415]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:34.431 --> 01:59:35.973]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:59:36.113 --> 01:59:40.720]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:43.604]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:43.824 --> 01:59:46.688]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:46.868 --> 01:59:51.595]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:51.795 --> 01:59:52.716]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:52.936 --> 01:59:55.879]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:56.180 --> 02:00:03.067]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:00:03.187 --> 02:00:06.290]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:00:06.451 --> 02:00:06.651]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:00:06.711 --> 02:00:07.992]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:00:11.576 --> 02:00:17.661]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:00:17.841 --> 02:00:21.584]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:00:21.604 --> 02:00:22.925]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:00:22.965 --> 02:00:23.565]  Take action today.
[02:00:23.585 --> 02:00:25.387]  The first step is getting scorable food.
[02:00:37.088 --> 02:00:38.988]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:39.489 --> 02:00:42.409]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:43.009 --> 02:00:43.429]  Aha!
[02:00:53.332 --> 02:00:56.552]  Final five minutes with our guest, Janine Roberts.
[02:00:56.592 --> 02:00:59.213]  We have Barbara Lowe Fisher joining us.
[02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:06.073]  The non-profit National Vaccine Information Center, NVIC, big developments there.
[02:01:06.093 --> 02:01:13.977]  They've been running a lot of psych warfare ops, having millions of theirs claim that they put out fake evidence that vaccines cause autism.
[02:01:13.997 --> 02:01:15.838]  We have the government's own internal documents.
[02:01:16.378 --> 02:01:17.178]  This won't work.
[02:01:17.218 --> 02:01:18.399]  This cover-up won't work.
[02:01:19.279 --> 02:01:25.122]  And interesting that our last guest on Diamonds was already bringing this up separately as one of her new investigations.
[02:01:25.162 --> 02:01:26.523]  They can't stop the truth coming out.
[02:01:26.823 --> 02:01:28.004]  Tyranny is in deep trouble.
[02:01:29.107 --> 02:01:30.787]  We'll make a final call for Janine Roberts.
[02:01:31.188 --> 02:01:35.249]  I want to also encourage everybody to get her book, Greed and Glitter, Janine Roberts.
[02:01:35.269 --> 02:01:38.650]  You can get it at lots of places, but we have it at Infowars.com.
[02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:46.072]  And this book can save you a lot of money from your wife or girlfriend not wanting diamonds anymore, or at least knowing that they're semi-precious laying on the ground.
[02:01:46.412 --> 02:01:49.873]  They're just geographically only in certain areas, so there's a global cartel controlling that.
[02:01:50.433 --> 02:01:52.093]  Let's talk to Alex in Florida.
[02:01:52.233 --> 02:01:54.194]  Alex, you are on the air with Janine Roberts.
[02:01:55.714 --> 02:01:57.655]  Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure to speak with you, sir.
[02:01:58.186 --> 02:01:58.886]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[02:01:58.926 --> 02:01:59.526]  What's your question?
[02:02:00.687 --> 02:02:02.147]  Not necessarily for Mr. Robertson.
[02:02:02.487 --> 02:02:03.967]  I was holding for a while.
[02:02:03.987 --> 02:02:06.728]  I thought we were taking callers who were specifically for her.
[02:02:07.148 --> 02:02:08.848]  In fact, go ahead, sir.
[02:02:08.868 --> 02:02:10.329]  Yeah, I've been holding for a while.
[02:02:10.369 --> 02:02:11.129]  I'm sorry, Mr. Jones.
[02:02:12.049 --> 02:02:20.671]  But I just wanted to mention something that was going on in Florida about the economy and the school district literally going bust and cutting everywhere.
[02:02:21.389 --> 02:02:24.451]  There's a protest going on, and it's really, really big.
[02:02:24.471 --> 02:02:25.471]  I don't know if you know anything about it.
[02:02:25.591 --> 02:02:27.932]  Everything's going to collapse by design, just like Mexico.
[02:02:27.952 --> 02:02:33.355]  I'm going to have to go back to you later, because I specifically went to the calls and asked who was for Mrs. Roberts, but thank you.
[02:02:33.375 --> 02:02:38.677]  You know, our guest is here to specifically talk about diamonds, or she expanded it out into vaccines.
[02:02:39.278 --> 02:02:42.419]  Janine Roberts, in the closing three minutes we have left, final comments from you.
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:48.322]  Okay, I wanted to say that I watched U.S.
[02:02:48.502 --> 02:02:50.203]  military scientists in Washington, D.C.
[02:02:51.673 --> 02:02:59.335]  They were using gas from the next door sewage plant, and passing it through an oxy-acetylene torch, and they were making diamonds from it.
[02:02:59.435 --> 02:03:00.195]  Real diamonds.
[02:03:00.635 --> 02:03:01.435]  Boulders diamonds.
[02:03:01.875 --> 02:03:03.115]  The tip missile cones.
[02:03:04.056 --> 02:03:11.457]  And they're kind of joking about it, because they said, the gas from the sewage works next door, it makes white diamonds.
[02:03:11.957 --> 02:03:13.958]  You know, really fine white diamonds.
[02:03:15.078 --> 02:03:20.139]  And I've now found out that De Beers has two plants, one on the Isle of Man, off the British coast,
[02:03:20.808 --> 02:03:25.850]  Another one in South Africa, where they use similar technology to manufacture pure diamonds.
[02:03:27.071 --> 02:03:34.694]  So when you get your diamond for your girlfriend, if you do decide to get one, just remember it could be made by the sewage works plant.
[02:03:35.654 --> 02:03:40.296]  Yeah, because they burn the methane and then get that pure carbon?
[02:03:41.257 --> 02:03:41.597]  They do.
[02:03:41.637 --> 02:03:46.619]  They're just injecting the gas into the oxy-cephalene flame.
[02:03:46.779 --> 02:03:49.300]  You didn't need anything more than an ordinary welding torch.
[02:03:51.550 --> 02:03:52.490]  You need high pressure.
[02:03:53.091 --> 02:03:54.371]  I mean, technology's changing.
[02:03:56.832 --> 02:04:03.314]  And, I mean, if you want to get stones, get emeralds or rubies or some of the other stones.
[02:04:03.494 --> 02:04:05.295]  They haven't got such a racket attached to them.
[02:04:05.915 --> 02:04:07.916]  It's diamonds that have got the worst racket of the lot.
[02:04:09.936 --> 02:04:16.499]  And it's simply... I haven't had a chance to say it, but they went into American high schools during the Second World War.
[02:04:17.774 --> 02:04:18.494]  We're good to go.
[02:04:45.776 --> 02:04:48.196]  If you want to get married, you've got to give your girl a diamond.
[02:04:49.597 --> 02:04:51.577]  They invented a story and they took us for a ride.
[02:04:52.617 --> 02:05:04.159]  And it works like a charm because people love to be suckers and the very same bankers that control the diamond trade and the drug trade, illegal and legal, are just gang raping us right now.
[02:05:04.179 --> 02:05:06.200]  We've got to fight them off like you did those thugs.
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:11.160]  The way that bankers are looked after at banks, they should be given money.
[02:05:18.848 --> 02:05:20.189]  They made a mess of our banks.
[02:05:20.749 --> 02:05:21.609]  Why give them more money?
[02:05:21.849 --> 02:05:23.350]  Well, a mess for them is good.
[02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:28.252]  Uh, Janine Roberts... I mean, it's like someone's got a gambling habit.
[02:05:28.272 --> 02:05:29.953]  Do you give them more money?
[02:05:31.613 --> 02:05:32.834]  Well, they got SWAT teams.
[02:05:32.874 --> 02:05:34.714]  If you don't follow their orders, they control the government.
[02:05:34.734 --> 02:05:36.195]  They have SWAT teams in the military.
[02:05:36.215 --> 02:05:41.517]  So, the fraud will continue endlessly until everybody's homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered.

[02:06:44.659 --> 02:06:51.020]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:53.381]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:06:54.041 --> 02:06:55.061]  But who is the enemy?
[02:06:55.601 --> 02:06:56.101]  Bin Laden.
[02:06:56.401 --> 02:06:57.302]  This is his ammo.
[02:06:57.342 --> 02:06:58.742]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:06:58.762 --> 02:07:00.422]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:07:00.742 --> 02:07:07.504]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:07:07.904 --> 02:07:08.344]  Some U.S.
[02:07:08.384 --> 02:07:14.025]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:07:14.725 --> 02:07:18.187]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:07:18.207 --> 02:07:20.388]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:07:44.668 --> 02:07:48.951]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:07:49.192 --> 02:07:54.095]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:07:54.295 --> 02:07:55.616]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:07:55.797 --> 02:07:59.299]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:51.068]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:08.022 --> 02:09:11.324]  We are working on getting Barbara Lowe Fisher on the horn.
[02:09:11.384 --> 02:09:19.609]  One of my producers is out today and it's wrong numbered in here, but I will work on getting her on from the
[02:09:21.075 --> 02:09:43.590]  National Vaccine Information Center, one of the founders of that, because they were there and followed the case of this whitewash vaccine damage court that the feds have, and just study after study, government studies, universities, the vaccines, cancer viruses, mercury, killing people, giving them cancer, just thousands and thousands of studies coming out every year.
[02:09:44.741 --> 02:09:46.042]  Just devastating people.
[02:09:47.002 --> 02:09:51.544]  And government documents getting leaked, and congressional hearings, but it's really never on the news.
[02:09:52.085 --> 02:10:03.290]  So they come out and say, oh, one doctor says that he faked evidence that vaccines caused autism, and that was the only study to ever say it, and it's all disproven now.
[02:10:03.330 --> 02:10:09.413]  Folks, let me try to say, people are over-reporting and over-diagnosing autism-type disorders.
[02:10:10.657 --> 02:10:12.478]  Well, that's funny.
[02:10:12.979 --> 02:10:17.101]  One subgroup of autistic folks are known as idiot savants.
[02:10:17.322 --> 02:10:18.262]  That's the term used.
[02:10:18.322 --> 02:10:19.523]  No insult to autistic children.
[02:10:19.543 --> 02:10:20.063]  That's the term.
[02:10:20.103 --> 02:10:20.864]  Idiot savant.
[02:10:21.865 --> 02:10:24.627]  I'm sure a lot of you have seen... What's the film with...
[02:10:27.631 --> 02:10:32.355]  Rain Man, where he's the card counter, and he's the idiot savant.
[02:10:44.184 --> 02:10:44.264]  No.
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:17.864]  One in 26,000, and now it was one in 168, and then it was now one in 87, and they have whole wings of schools with the autistic children now, and you take your children to see a movie, I've done it a few times, and they'll have whole rows of the autistic children.
[02:11:19.144 --> 02:11:25.926]  And all these poor mothers there that were good mommies and gave them all the shots, and you talk to these mothers and you say, when did this happen?
[02:11:27.728 --> 02:11:30.589]  When did this first unfold?
[02:11:31.930 --> 02:11:33.130]  And they say, oh, 18 months.
[02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:36.351]  And these will be mothers who don't even know about vaccines and autism.
[02:11:36.371 --> 02:11:39.112]  They're like, oh, he was 18 months, or she was 18 months.
[02:11:39.132 --> 02:11:40.253]  We gave him his third round of shots.
[02:11:40.933 --> 02:11:41.573]  And then it happened.
[02:11:42.874 --> 02:11:45.715]  You'll need to communicate with John if she's there, because I don't know.
[02:11:46.415 --> 02:11:47.455]  No one's letting me know.
[02:11:47.855 --> 02:11:48.876]  Yeah.
[02:11:48.916 --> 02:11:49.236]  Thank you.
[02:11:53.578 --> 02:11:55.058]  So all of this goes on.
[02:11:55.338 --> 02:11:57.219]  All of this happens.
[02:11:59.298 --> 02:12:05.163]  And it just gets worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.
[02:12:07.284 --> 02:12:15.351]  And there's so many other situations now where government allows industry to do this, and it's by design, it's eugenics.
[02:12:17.455 --> 02:12:23.577]  I mean, I get up on air and I tell people half of corn syrup products have high levels of mercury.
[02:12:24.117 --> 02:12:26.898]  Now, that's just a tested fact by independent industry and the government.
[02:12:26.918 --> 02:12:28.158]  In fact, Google that, folks.
[02:12:29.458 --> 02:12:31.879]  Mercury corn syrup, because people still, you know, don't believe this.
[02:12:32.279 --> 02:12:34.580]  Just Google, and then hit News, Mercury
[02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:38.257]  in corn syrup, and I want to show the Washington Post headline.
[02:12:39.077 --> 02:12:40.379]  And now they just said, you know what?
[02:12:40.879 --> 02:12:42.481]  Mercury isn't bad for you anymore.
[02:12:42.841 --> 02:12:43.722]  And I have the newscast.
[02:12:43.742 --> 02:12:44.543]  I've played it many times.
[02:12:44.563 --> 02:12:45.404]  I'm not going to play it again.
[02:12:45.704 --> 02:12:48.988]  You can just Google News says Mercury's good for you.
[02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:53.813]  It turns out that 90 plus percent, I want to Google this next,
[02:12:55.575 --> 02:12:56.735]  Just show the news article.
[02:12:58.096 --> 02:13:03.517]  90 plus percent of infant formula has melamine, deadly plastic, attacks all the organs, the kidneys.
[02:13:03.777 --> 02:13:05.177]  They just used to say it was bad.
[02:13:05.458 --> 02:13:06.718]  People are dying all over the place from it.
[02:13:06.738 --> 02:13:07.998]  They just say, no, it's good for you now.
[02:13:09.979 --> 02:13:14.860]  Bayer shipped out over a million ampoules of Factor VIII filled with HIV and hepatitis knowingly.
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:16.460]  It came out in their own documents and lawsuits.
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.321]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:13:17.381 --> 02:13:21.382]  It's just, hey, you know, HIV is good for you.
[02:13:21.402 --> 02:13:22.442]  Hepatitis is good for you.
[02:13:25.572 --> 02:13:34.098]  Millions and millions and millions have died, the government admits, from the Simian virus 40 alone, and there's all these other viruses.
[02:13:34.118 --> 02:13:38.522]  You heard last hour about leukemia viruses in your shots.
[02:13:40.003 --> 02:13:44.386]  Or all the government studies about how you have a massive increase in Alzheimer's if you take the shots.
[02:13:45.046 --> 02:13:48.089]  We do have our guest on with us.
[02:13:49.252 --> 02:13:57.076]  And I appreciate Barbara Lowe Fisher, one of the founders of the non-profit National Vaccine Information Center, on with us.
[02:13:57.116 --> 02:14:03.820]  And she's been tracking the propaganda, the disinfo being put out by the government's own court, bought and paid for by the vaccine makers.
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:05.941]  And so she joins us now for the Balance of the Hour.
[02:14:05.961 --> 02:14:08.243]  We'll open the phones up later in the hour for her.
[02:14:08.583 --> 02:14:09.763]  Barbara, great to have you here with us.
[02:14:10.344 --> 02:14:10.884]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:11.934 --> 02:14:14.234]  Okay, break down the latest.
[02:14:14.294 --> 02:14:21.956]  I know HPV is killing folks and maiming them and others telling us that autism isn't caused by vaccines now with this latest federal court ruling.
[02:14:22.956 --> 02:14:25.136]  Break down what's most important for folks to know right now.
[02:14:25.797 --> 02:14:29.437]  My goodness, there's so much going on just in the past three weeks.
[02:14:30.937 --> 02:14:35.298]  Yes, we issued a press release several weeks ago.
[02:14:35.318 --> 02:14:39.459]  It was actually a special report that was carried on CBS.
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:46.705]  Regarding Gardasil vaccine, HPV vaccine, that was licensed in 2006 after being fast-tracked.
[02:14:47.405 --> 02:14:59.294]  The FDA allowed Merck to fast-track that vaccine, unfortunately, because it's killing and brain injuring and causing immune system problems, really serious problems for a lot of girls.
[02:14:59.394 --> 02:15:07.920]  And what's really tragic, a lot of these girls are very healthy, high-functioning, I mean, straight-A students, athletes, gymnasts, cheerleaders.
[02:15:09.476 --> 02:15:26.762]  Very, very healthy girls who are getting one or more shots of Gardasil and are dying within days or weeks of this vaccination, are being left with seizure disorders that can't be controlled with medication, rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.
[02:15:27.362 --> 02:15:28.643]  They will collapse.
[02:15:28.743 --> 02:15:30.663]  Their blood pressure will drop and they will collapse.
[02:15:30.703 --> 02:15:36.145]  There's inflammation of the heart, inflammation of the brain, inflammation of different organs in the body.
[02:15:37.188 --> 02:15:38.388]  It's really serious.
[02:15:38.509 --> 02:15:52.980]  If you go onto our website at www.nbic.org, you can search the MedAlerts database, which we have provided the data from the Vaccine Average Event Reporting System, where you can go on and you can search.
[02:15:54.261 --> 02:16:04.169]  If you just click on HPV4 and search the field, you can read the reports that are being made to the government, which the government has dismissed as being all a coincidence.
[02:16:04.662 --> 02:16:12.084]  In October, the government issued a report saying all of these girls who are dying and who are being brain injured, it's all a coincidence.
[02:16:12.144 --> 02:16:14.604]  It has nothing to do with Gardasil vaccine.
[02:16:15.505 --> 02:16:17.805]  And we issued a report, as I said, several weeks ago.
[02:16:18.225 --> 02:16:32.669]  What we did is we went in and we looked and compared Gardasil vaccine reactions, adverse event reports, to the federal vaccine adverse event reporting system with another vaccine that is also used in the same age group, that is 11 to 12 year old children.
[02:16:34.608 --> 02:16:36.248]  And that vaccine is called Menactra.
[02:16:36.328 --> 02:16:38.129]  It's a vaccine for meningococcal.
[02:16:38.949 --> 02:16:48.491]  And the difference between the two vaccines is that the meningococcal vaccine, Menactra, is given to both boys and girls, whereas Gardasil is only given to girls.
[02:16:48.991 --> 02:17:04.115]  And what we found was that 3 to 30 times more reports of serious health problems and death after Gardasil than after Menactra vaccine.
[02:17:05.221 --> 02:17:09.325]  And, you know, we're talking twice as many emergency room visits.
[02:17:10.105 --> 02:17:17.672]  We're talking seven times the reports for the field disabled or did not recover.
[02:17:19.253 --> 02:17:31.403]  It was clear that you had two vaccines, and if the vaccines were equally reactive, if it was all a coincidence, you would have actually had a higher incidence in the Menactor group.
[02:17:31.483 --> 02:17:31.803]  Why?
[02:17:32.023 --> 02:17:33.805]  Because Menactor is only given once.
[02:17:34.375 --> 02:17:37.797]  It's given singly and you have, it's given to boys and girls.
[02:17:37.857 --> 02:17:45.861]  You have about 16 million doses of that vaccine that have been given as of about the middle of last year and 15 million doses of Gardasil.
[02:17:45.881 --> 02:17:47.422]  Gardasil is given three times.
[02:17:47.962 --> 02:17:54.325]  So you really should have, if everything was the same, you should have had more reaction reports after Menactra.
[02:17:54.645 --> 02:18:03.930]  So clearly we've got a problem with Gardasil and I think that it's really important for anybody out there who is even considering having their daughter vaccinated with this vaccine
[02:18:04.286 --> 02:18:08.249]  They've got to do their own research before they take that child in.
[02:18:08.669 --> 02:18:18.316]  Well, I just want to add that I just noticed with exact headlines from articles we've written and linked to that there's some type of Google block right now on a separate issue.
[02:18:18.336 --> 02:18:19.297]  I was just looking for it.
[02:18:19.417 --> 02:18:21.319]  Melamine in 90% of baby formula.
[02:18:21.359 --> 02:18:22.840]  That was a Washington Post headline.
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:25.902]  It's not even available on news or web.
[02:18:25.942 --> 02:18:26.843]  They are scrubbing.
[02:18:27.123 --> 02:18:28.024]  Have you run into this?
[02:18:28.964 --> 02:18:31.806]  Well, it's interesting you bring that up because I did.
[02:18:32.347 --> 02:18:33.648]  There was someone who said
[02:18:34.349 --> 02:18:34.709]  That's great.
[02:18:54.370 --> 02:18:58.514]  I don't know whether there is this whitewashing going on.
[02:18:58.534 --> 02:18:59.796]  There definitely is.
[02:18:59.816 --> 02:19:02.778]  I put the exact headline in and it's not there.
[02:19:04.220 --> 02:19:05.081]  This is getting sick.
[02:19:05.341 --> 02:19:09.725]  You know, I want to get into the facts and the data with you when we come back, but right now, Barbara...
[02:19:10.686 --> 02:19:14.108]  I want to understand, how do they think they're going to get away with all of this?
[02:19:14.168 --> 02:19:27.735]  I mean, not just the vaccines, but mercury in half of the corn syrup, 90 plus percent of the baby formula, melamine, and before it's a scientific fact it's killing people, now they just say, no, it's good!
[02:19:28.055 --> 02:19:30.416]  I mean, it's almost like mass mental illness has happened.
[02:19:31.296 --> 02:19:40.261]  Well, you know, I mean, certainly we have absolutely do not have enough regulation of the toxins which are being put into our environment by the
[02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:49.095]  Chemical companies, by pharmaceutical companies, by many different companies that are producing these products that are toxic.
[02:19:49.815 --> 02:20:03.164]  And it's only going to be changed by the people rising up and demanding that the politicians that they elect, the legislators they elect at the state and federal level, are responsive to the concerns of the people.
[02:20:03.444 --> 02:20:09.328]  Because otherwise we are going to become consumers of toxic products, and particularly in the area of vaccination.
[02:20:09.676 --> 02:20:22.521]  When there's calls to end the exemptions, to end religious and philosophical exemptions, leaving only medical exemptions, which you can't even get anymore, we become captive, you know, captive consumers of toxic products.
[02:20:23.242 --> 02:20:24.622]  Barbara Lowe Fisher, stay there.
[02:20:24.642 --> 02:20:26.963]  I want to give out the website for folks that want to get informed.

[02:20:29.024 --> 02:20:30.765]  I want to go through this latest whitewash.
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:39.424]  With Keith Olbermann really disgracing himself trying to come out and say that people faked autism information as a way to discredit it all.

[02:21:44.341 --> 02:21:46.382]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:21:46.502 --> 02:21:48.922]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:21:48.942 --> 02:21:51.503]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:21:51.523 --> 02:21:52.743]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:21:52.763 --> 02:21:54.364]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:21:54.464 --> 02:21:57.265]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:21:57.285 --> 02:22:00.986]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:22:10.656 --> 02:22:15.527]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:22:19.304 --> 02:22:20.405]  How dare you?
[02:22:21.727 --> 02:22:26.791]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:22:26.811 --> 02:22:29.614]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:22:29.714 --> 02:22:35.900]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:25:00.491 --> 02:25:01.212]  Barbara Lowe Fisher,
[02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:10.023]  The head of the preeminent organization that fights for people to know the truth about vaccines and know what's happening.
[02:25:10.923 --> 02:25:13.023]  The National Vaccine Information Center is our guest.
[02:25:13.123 --> 02:25:16.184]  Please continue going down the holocaust that's happening.
[02:25:17.184 --> 02:25:21.085]  Well, you had mentioned prior to break that, you know, what's happened in the U.S.
[02:25:21.105 --> 02:25:27.707]  Court of Claims here in Washington with regard to giving compensation to children who have been injured by vaccines.
[02:25:28.226 --> 02:25:39.972]  You know, many years ago, when the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was passed, our children were only being asked by government, recommended by government, to get seven vaccines.
[02:25:40.132 --> 02:25:42.173]  It was 23 doses of seven vaccines.
[02:25:42.593 --> 02:25:47.836]  It was measles, mumps, and rubella, and MMR, and DPT, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and polio.
[02:25:47.856 --> 02:25:49.917]  So seven, 23 doses of seven vaccines.
[02:25:50.597 --> 02:25:53.779]  That law was supposed to be for vaccines
[02:25:54.495 --> 02:26:00.519]  That, you know, like polio, that we were trying to control, polio.
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:11.947]  It was not for vaccines like Gardasil, as I was speaking of before, or some rotavirus and these other vaccines that have now come out since then.
[02:26:12.688 --> 02:26:16.170]  Now our children are getting 69 doses of 16 vaccines.
[02:26:16.551 --> 02:26:22.875]  And a lot of children are regressing after getting all of these vaccines, sometimes 8 to 10 vaccines on one day.
[02:26:23.328 --> 02:26:32.672]  And they're regressing and they're becoming autistic, learning disabled, having ADHD, ADD, intestinal bowel disorders, etc.
[02:26:33.332 --> 02:26:36.994]  Well, the government doesn't really want to acknowledge that this is occurring.
[02:26:37.394 --> 02:26:43.997]  And so what's happened over the years is a system that was supposed to provide parents with an alternative to suing doctors in court.
[02:26:44.417 --> 02:26:47.358]  It was really what I call an experiment in tort reform.
[02:26:47.418 --> 02:26:49.479]  There was a lot of pressure for tort reform
[02:26:50.138 --> 02:26:50.979]  Twenty years ago.
[02:26:51.299 --> 02:26:53.980]  And Congress was persuaded by the vaccine manufacturers.
[02:26:54.261 --> 02:26:58.303]  They told Congress and the country they were going to leave this country without any vaccines.
[02:26:58.723 --> 02:27:00.705]  Congress said we are going to protect these companies.
[02:27:01.125 --> 02:27:04.827]  So, we came to the table and fought for as much as we had no power.
[02:27:04.867 --> 02:27:08.229]  We came and fought for as much as we could get for the families.
[02:27:08.849 --> 02:27:15.473]  Now, what was supposed to be a no-fault, non-adversarial alternative to a lawsuit has turned into a mock court trial in this U.S.
[02:27:15.493 --> 02:27:15.914]  Court of Claims.
[02:27:16.696 --> 02:27:26.039]  Or instead of being allowed to plead your case in front of a jury of your peers, you are pleading your case in front of one person, a special master appointed by the U.S.
[02:27:26.099 --> 02:27:26.779]  Court of Claims.
[02:27:27.519 --> 02:27:43.263]  So over the years, what the Departments of Justice and Departments of Health and Human Services have done is that they've really gutted the original deal that was made in this law, which was supposed to presume causation in the absence of a better explanation.
[02:27:43.643 --> 02:27:45.784]  That is, children were supposed to be compensated
[02:27:47.049 --> 02:27:53.173]  If you could not find an alternative explanation to why they became brain injured or died after vaccination.
[02:27:53.633 --> 02:27:59.296]  It was never supposed to be a place where you were supposed to prove causation and fact, like you have to in a civil court of law.
[02:27:59.856 --> 02:28:10.562]  But over the years, because they've gutted this system and made it very, very weak and very hard for plaintiff's lawyers and the victims, it's turned into this joke.
[02:28:11.813 --> 02:28:16.236]  And the result, the culmination of it, was what happened several weeks ago when the U.S.
[02:28:16.276 --> 02:28:29.547]  Court of Claims, and you know, I don't even know how this happened, in that there was like this class action suit, in effect, that was brought on behalf of like about 5,000 children who had regressed after vaccination into autism.
[02:28:29.947 --> 02:28:36.713]  And there were only two very narrow biological mechanism arguments made that had to do with thimerosal and MMR vaccine.
[02:28:37.153 --> 02:28:40.696]  Even though there are many other biological mechanisms that could have been argued,
[02:28:41.115 --> 02:28:42.376]  Or been argued differently.
[02:28:42.916 --> 02:28:51.983]  So they lumped all of these children into two small, narrow arguments as to why they were brain injured by these vaccines.
[02:28:53.024 --> 02:29:00.510]  And what happened was, because the really good studies that should be published in the medical literature don't get published, why don't they get published?
[02:29:00.770 --> 02:29:06.094]  Because the pharmaceutical industry has an inordinate influence on what is published in the medical literature.
[02:29:06.761 --> 02:29:15.607]  And that was the same week that that, actually the same day that that court, um, the judgment was issued which denied these children compensation.
[02:29:16.467 --> 02:29:27.975]  The British Medical Journal had the courage, for once, to publish an article by Tom Jefferson out of Italy, an epidemiologist who has a lot of integrity, who publishes reviews for the Cochrane Collaboration.
[02:29:28.395 --> 02:29:36.080]  And he showed that on influenza vaccine, for example, he showed with doing an actual epidemiological analysis
[02:29:36.658 --> 02:29:44.242]  That the studies that are funded by the pharmaceutical companies get preferential treatment in the medical journals.
[02:29:44.702 --> 02:29:51.645]  And those who are not funded by Pharma don't get published or are not valued as highly.
[02:29:52.226 --> 02:29:53.186]  So, what did the U.S.
[02:29:53.206 --> 02:29:56.308]  Court of Claims Special Masters have to consider?
[02:29:56.788 --> 02:30:02.651]  They had inadequate evidence to consider, officially, because you don't have the studies published that should be published.
[02:30:02.891 --> 02:30:04.672]  Plus, you have lousy studies published.
[02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:14.348]  So, what happened, net net, was they rejected these three cases, which is going to have an impact on all of those other children.
[02:30:14.568 --> 02:30:15.769]  Yeah, setting a precedent.
[02:30:16.129 --> 02:30:17.390]  Barbara Lowe Fisher, stay there.
[02:30:17.410 --> 02:30:24.116]  We're going to come back and get more into this and talk about solutions because we are reaching critical mass.
[02:30:24.236 --> 02:30:29.220]  Folks are really waking up right now to the fact that these vaccines are killing and maiming a lot of people.
[02:30:34.702 --> 02:30:37.687]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:38.628 --> 02:30:41.313]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:48.052]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:30:48.232 --> 02:30:52.315]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:30:52.475 --> 02:31:03.922]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:31:04.142 --> 02:31:09.986]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:31:10.266 --> 02:31:10.546]  I'm good.
[02:31:33.547 --> 02:31:38.091]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:31:38.351 --> 02:31:39.732]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:31:53.979 --> 02:31:55.000]  But who is the enemy?
[02:31:55.521 --> 02:31:56.021]  Bin Laden.
[02:31:56.321 --> 02:31:57.282]  This is his M.O.
[02:31:57.302 --> 02:31:58.624]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:31:58.664 --> 02:32:00.306]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:32:00.686 --> 02:32:07.433]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:32:07.833 --> 02:32:08.274]  Some U.S.
[02:32:08.314 --> 02:32:13.980]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:32:14.660 --> 02:32:18.141]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:32:18.161 --> 02:32:20.962]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:32:44.355 --> 02:32:48.939]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[02:32:49.279 --> 02:32:56.464]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[02:32:56.705 --> 02:32:58.106]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[02:32:58.326 --> 02:33:02.229]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[02:33:02.489 --> 02:33:06.072]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[02:33:06.312 --> 02:33:10.415]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[02:33:10.795 --> 02:33:14.258]  Phase One is a One World Currency which we are currently being prepared to
[02:33:14.278 --> 02:33:14.638]  I think so.
[02:33:50.385 --> 02:33:57.208]  Alright, going back to Barbara Lowe Fisher, some of your phone calls for her coming up specifically on the vaccine issue, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:57.448 --> 02:34:12.814]  Now I know, in Globalist documents we covered in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, they say they would use vaccines to put the soft kill weapons, the viruses, the chemicals that dumb people down, to create this new society.
[02:34:13.814 --> 02:34:18.636]  There's no doubt that these big companies know it's hurting people, the government knows it's hurting people, and they're doing it.
[02:34:20.154 --> 02:34:29.311]  And I guess we should probably get into a discussion with you about the fact that all over the country they do these stunts where they say it's the law, you've got to have shots or you're going to jail.
[02:34:30.558 --> 02:34:37.541]  When there's waivers to not have to take them to go to school or work at a certain business, but those waivers themselves aren't even law to get one.
[02:34:37.961 --> 02:34:43.664]  Now they're trying to deny waivers, as they train us first to take a waiver, then they take the waiver away when there's not even a law.
[02:34:44.184 --> 02:34:47.746]  That's kind of like the NIS and the Animal ID and all that, too, taking over farms.
[02:34:48.146 --> 02:34:51.828]  It's this color of law where they train us to do things that aren't even the law.
[02:34:52.428 --> 02:34:53.589]  Where is the fight going?
[02:34:53.629 --> 02:34:58.231]  Because as people wake up to the fact that vaccines are just deadly and horrible and
[02:34:58.971 --> 02:35:05.235]  Now we see PR ads everywhere about how corn syrup's good for us, and how vaccines are good for us, and how melamine's okay for us.
[02:35:05.255 --> 02:35:07.317]  I mean, that's on the, you know, TV now as ads.
[02:35:07.757 --> 02:35:09.799]  That shows they're getting desperate.
[02:35:09.839 --> 02:35:17.864]  So, I mean, that's exciting to know people are waking up, but the establishment's counter-striking, saying, we're just gonna go ahead and try to actually pass laws to make you take them.
[02:35:18.204 --> 02:35:21.186]  Because, you know, you're figuring out that we lied to you and there's no law.
[02:35:21.206 --> 02:35:24.589]  I mean, that's a mouthful, but can you comment on that?
[02:35:25.182 --> 02:35:26.082]  I agree with you.
[02:35:26.102 --> 02:35:29.263]  I'll tell you what I'm really concerned about.
[02:35:30.603 --> 02:35:44.066]  In the early 1990s, pharmaceutical companies and government and actually even stars in Hollywood, unfortunately, decided it was a great idea to set up electronic vaccine tracking systems.
[02:35:44.926 --> 02:35:48.207]  They started in cities and then they moved to states.
[02:35:49.436 --> 02:36:06.439]  And now we're going to see a national medical records electronic tracking system set up under the new stimulus plan and health, you know, the reform of health insurance and the vaccine tracking systems are going to be definitely become part of that.
[02:36:07.039 --> 02:36:15.141]  And, you know, in 1995, Donna Shalala and HHS appropriated the social security number
[02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:23.475]  For use in vaccine tracking systems that they really the vaccine issue was the first used to justify
[02:36:24.019 --> 02:36:27.761]  Electronic tracking of citizens in this country.
[02:36:27.801 --> 02:36:45.190]  And let me just add, let me just add for folks that aren't aware of this, they're saying under the new national ID and the new medical monitoring system that they're setting the policies through the bioethicist boards of the hospitals and they're doing these scare stories about tuberculosis and things.
[02:36:45.210 --> 02:36:47.432]  They let all the immigrants come in, but they don't test them.
[02:36:47.772 --> 02:36:51.194]  But then they're saying citizens and people won't be able to fly.
[02:36:51.254 --> 02:36:52.214]  They're actually proposing this.
[02:36:52.254 --> 02:36:53.015]  I'm sure you've heard of it.
[02:36:53.715 --> 02:36:55.596]  If you haven't had all your shots up to date.
[02:36:55.616 --> 02:36:57.658]  So they're really getting ready to clamp down.
[02:36:58.078 --> 02:37:06.383]  Well, indeed, in 1991, they forwarded this sort of national health care idea and the electronic medical tracking.
[02:37:06.403 --> 02:37:10.586]  At that time, people were outraged and they protested against it.
[02:37:10.606 --> 02:37:16.170]  I remember NVIC, my organization, testified and said, you know, this is not a good idea.
[02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:19.732]  We knew the vaccine tracking systems was what they wanted.
[02:37:20.394 --> 02:37:25.536]  And we knew that there was going to be societal punishments attached, most likely, for not complying.
[02:37:26.017 --> 02:37:38.322]  Back then, there was a suggestion by different people that you shouldn't be able to file your state or federal taxes and take an exemption for children, especially if you couldn't show proof that the child had gotten all government-recommended vaccines.
[02:37:38.622 --> 02:37:40.463]  You couldn't get a driver's license.
[02:37:40.883 --> 02:37:45.585]  They were talking at that time about planes, you know, getting on planes or going into stadiums or whatever.
[02:37:46.396 --> 02:37:49.057]  And at the time, society was not ready for it.
[02:37:49.177 --> 02:37:52.799]  Well, they took their time and now this is going to be forwarded.
[02:37:52.959 --> 02:38:11.647]  I have always been very, very concerned about this because, you know, once you have a tracking of everybody's movement and you have a tracking of everybody's health care records and vaccination status, it is easy to attach societal sanctions for not, for example, vaccinating with all government recommended vaccines.
[02:38:12.148 --> 02:38:14.909]  Since 9-1-1, there definitely has been an attempt
[02:38:15.416 --> 02:38:22.140]  To define disease control as a matter of national and international... Let me stop there.
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:24.761]  This isn't some science fiction movie.
[02:38:25.221 --> 02:38:37.888]  Tommy Thompson, as Health and Human Services Secretary, five years ago traveled to high schools all over the country and colleges and said, every American, by law, needs an implantable microchip to stop epidemics so we can track all of you.
[02:38:37.928 --> 02:38:42.771]  So they're openly saying forced chipping on record, but then he refused to take it.
[02:38:44.252 --> 02:38:52.778]  So a lot of times people stand down to this stuff because it sounds so crazy, but it's the government and the corporations pushing it.
[02:38:52.798 --> 02:38:57.262]  And I know there are a bunch of eugenicists that want to carry out health care rationing and getting rid of the old.
[02:38:57.742 --> 02:38:59.103]  Tom Daschle in his book said that.
[02:38:59.163 --> 02:39:00.884]  It's in the bill to start rationing.
[02:39:01.645 --> 02:39:03.166]  So this is eugenics.
[02:39:03.686 --> 02:39:05.388]  This isn't good government health care.
[02:39:05.888 --> 02:39:10.632]  You know, which is bad enough, it gives the government total control to make you do what they want.
[02:39:10.672 --> 02:39:22.243]  And in England, as you know, Barbara, but listeners probably don't, two years ago, they started threatening people under government health care that they had to have all their vaccines, or they're denying not just children, but adults critical care.
[02:39:22.543 --> 02:39:28.969]  You pay your taxes, you're in a socialist system, and they say, you won't put in your body what we want, you're not going to get health care.
[02:39:30.310 --> 02:39:45.157]  Well, you know, you have to understand that when this happened to my son, when my son was vaccinated in 1980, there is no way that I ever imagined that I would learn the things that I've learned over the last 27 years.
[02:39:45.617 --> 02:39:53.681]  And I, you know, I sat at the table with people from industry, from government, from special interest groups funded by industry.
[02:39:54.141 --> 02:39:55.602]  I did not believe that all of them
[02:39:56.654 --> 02:39:58.895]  They are deliberately trying to hurt people.
[02:39:58.955 --> 02:40:02.937]  What I think is that ideology has definitely blinded people.
[02:40:03.577 --> 02:40:05.257]  They do see these vaccines.
[02:40:05.297 --> 02:40:14.261]  I remember Robert Mendelsohn, who was the founder of the holistic health care movement in this country back in the 1970s, used to say that vaccination is the new sacrament.
[02:40:14.741 --> 02:40:16.482]  And it is almost like a religion.
[02:40:16.502 --> 02:40:18.443]  No, it's a government religion.
[02:40:18.463 --> 02:40:20.043]  Oh, give me the sacrament.
[02:40:20.583 --> 02:40:24.325]  It's like a religion in that they believe, or at least
[02:40:26.801 --> 02:40:33.988]  Look, they're eugenicists, they want to set the precedent that we line up and take whatever shots they say, just like going into the showers.
[02:40:34.209 --> 02:40:34.509]  Go ahead.
[02:40:34.569 --> 02:40:40.415]  I do believe that they want us to take, absolutely want to have, create a system whereby we will be forced
[02:40:40.956 --> 02:40:49.160]  To take the products, the pharmaceutical products and the vaccines that they believe are going to, quote, keep the society safe.
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:53.742]  Now, I don't agree... Well, they've been doing national drills to forcibly inoculate us under FEMA.
[02:40:54.222 --> 02:41:09.530]  Well, and I'm concerned that we have, for whatever reason they're doing it, we as a society, as a people, as a free people, need to stand up and say, you know, state legislators, federal legislators, you have got to pass legislation
[02:41:09.895 --> 02:41:10.456]  We're good to go.
[02:41:28.650 --> 02:41:30.651]  And trust blindly at our peril.
[02:41:31.092 --> 02:41:31.792]  Yeah, let me say this.
[02:41:31.812 --> 02:41:32.313]  That's for sure.
[02:41:32.413 --> 02:41:36.335]  Let me say this, Barbara Lowe Fisher, and get your take on it as one of the preeminent experts on this.
[02:41:36.856 --> 02:41:40.918]  We're talking to all the doctors and, you know, constantly tracking all the latest developments and research.
[02:41:41.939 --> 02:41:52.026]  Even if vaccines had never hurt anybody and were wonderful and were great, it would be a wicked, evil, dangerous precedent to set a precedent where whatever the government says they want in our body, they can force.
[02:41:52.066 --> 02:41:55.709]  Because down the road, some evil group can come into control and do that.
[02:41:55.829 --> 02:41:57.730]  But instead... I totally agree with you.
[02:41:57.990 --> 02:42:00.011]  That's a very important statement.
[02:42:00.671 --> 02:42:04.272]  We have, you know, incrementally, our freedoms are being taken from us.
[02:42:04.752 --> 02:42:08.012]  And people lead such busy lives.
[02:42:08.513 --> 02:42:12.874]  And they need to understand, they have to, every single day, be vigilant.
[02:42:13.634 --> 02:42:15.914]  The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
[02:42:15.994 --> 02:42:18.615]  I believe that was Thomas Jefferson or someone who said that.
[02:42:18.995 --> 02:42:20.155]  But it is so true.
[02:42:20.456 --> 02:42:26.037]  Because, you know, if you set up an infrastructure and a government that doesn't allow the people to have
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:34.352]  Free choice, particularly in health care, then somebody, as you point out, could come in and use that against all of us.
[02:42:34.652 --> 02:42:41.922]  And then you look at the truth, the atomic soldiers, the Tuskegee Airmen, the children being radiated to death, the thousands of them here in the U.S.
[02:42:43.001 --> 02:42:45.323]  Then you know it is a bad group already in control.
[02:42:45.363 --> 02:42:46.004]  They set it up.
[02:42:46.144 --> 02:42:47.265]  It is evil intentions.
[02:42:47.325 --> 02:42:47.886]  It is bad.
[02:42:48.146 --> 02:42:53.691]  You have a bunch of lazy bureaucrats, control freaks at health departments and state health departments and federal level.
[02:42:53.951 --> 02:42:55.593]  Yeah, they're just following orders.
[02:42:55.613 --> 02:42:56.574]  They're compartmentalized.
[02:42:56.874 --> 02:42:57.875]  They're blissfully ignorant.
[02:42:57.895 --> 02:43:02.219]  They shoot their kids up and watch them get in the corner and be gone forever.
[02:43:02.459 --> 02:43:03.760]  And they just rationalize it.
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:04.401]  It's a sick
[02:43:04.841 --> 02:43:05.061]  Yes.
[02:43:21.852 --> 02:43:22.012]  Yeah.
[02:43:39.828 --> 02:43:42.070]  In mosquitos, so you have to take it.
[02:43:42.250 --> 02:43:44.331]  We want to put it in your food, so you have to take it.
[02:43:44.592 --> 02:43:49.835]  You know, and as everybody's getting sick, and they just keep going, the men in SWAT teams will drop by if you don't take it.
[02:43:50.016 --> 02:43:51.136]  We're your loving government.
[02:43:51.397 --> 02:43:53.878]  I mean, how can the cattle not see what's happening to them?
[02:43:54.699 --> 02:44:05.727]  Well, you know, I've been really interested in how Hollywood, in both film and on television, in drama in the evenings, is starting to sort of
[02:44:07.126 --> 02:44:09.547]  Shine a light on some of this through fiction.
[02:44:10.007 --> 02:44:19.630]  I mean, if you look at some of the films that have been out, whether it's I Am Legend, V for Vendetta, some of these films, is it the 11th hour that is now?
[02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:23.411]  That's because so many Hollywood people have given shots to their kids.
[02:44:23.431 --> 02:44:27.332]  I know you know Charlie Sheen, and it's hurt their children.
[02:44:28.652 --> 02:44:34.954]  Well, certainly our creative people in society, our authors, our screenwriters, playwriters,
[02:44:35.630 --> 02:44:44.996]  They do sometimes see where things are going and they ring the bell and I definitely see this more and more.
[02:44:45.416 --> 02:44:58.964]  You're seeing these themes of science gone amok, physicians who kind of are playing God and the result when you don't have the people, have control over
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:02.802]  Those who are in positions of power who are playing God.
[02:45:14.631 --> 02:45:18.292]  And it's all about how, gotta get the abortion, you're backwards if you don't want it.
[02:45:19.132 --> 02:45:20.553]  You know, just selling abortion.
[02:45:20.573 --> 02:45:22.553]  I mean, even if you're for abortion, what's the effect of selling it?
[02:45:23.333 --> 02:45:28.615]  And then selling, oh, everybody dies or gets sick at the clinic because one person hasn't been vaccinated.
[02:45:28.935 --> 02:45:33.116]  If you're supposedly vaccinated, somebody who isn't vaccinated isn't going to infect you.
[02:45:33.396 --> 02:45:35.157]  So we also see counter-propaganda.
[02:45:36.017 --> 02:45:42.359]  Well, certainly, if one is going to take the risk with getting a vaccine, because every vaccine carries a risk.
[02:45:42.459 --> 02:45:43.739]  It's greater for some than others.
[02:45:44.403 --> 02:45:50.224]  Then one should at least be at least 99 to 100 percent guaranteed that that vaccine is going to work.
[02:45:50.324 --> 02:45:50.885]  And you're right.
[02:45:51.345 --> 02:46:00.087]  If the vaccines are as effective as the companies said they are and the government said they are, then you should have them vaccinated, should have nothing to fear from the unvaccinated.
[02:46:00.347 --> 02:46:04.908]  And there shouldn't be such an issue about forcing people to get vaccinated if they don't want to.
[02:46:05.859 --> 02:46:09.683]  Now, what about what happened in Maryland a year and a half ago?
[02:46:09.743 --> 02:46:14.007]  I had the state attorney on, and he said, I haven't vaccinated my kids.
[02:46:14.487 --> 02:46:16.029]  And I said, well, why are there police dogs?
[02:46:16.049 --> 02:46:25.537]  Well, in case there was any problem, guys in riot gear, police dogs, thousands of kids, 1500 kids and their parents, thinking that it was the law to take shots, crying, not wanting it subconsciously.
[02:46:26.178 --> 02:46:29.741]  You know, knowing it was bad, and then they didn't even show them waivers or let them know.
[02:46:29.761 --> 02:46:36.627]  I mean, this mass fraud of every year before school saying it's the law, you gotta take shots, when it's not the law.
[02:46:36.887 --> 02:46:39.589]  That right there should make everybody run from vaccines.
[02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:48.797]  Well, I think a lot of people looked at that TV coverage, and I was there that day, and I can tell you, it was a very chilling sight.
[02:46:49.338 --> 02:46:54.462]  Because they made sure that that SWAT team, with those police dogs and carrying guns,
[02:46:54.881 --> 02:46:55.902]  We're very visible.
[02:46:56.182 --> 02:46:57.222]  They did it deliberately.
[02:46:57.643 --> 02:47:03.326]  And they would not let anyone into that courthouse to look at what was happening, including the media.
[02:47:03.966 --> 02:47:10.630]  And so, I thought it was just a very chilling scene, and I thought it was a wake-up call for everybody.
[02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:15.213]  Because this is an inappropriate flexing of state power.
[02:47:15.313 --> 02:47:18.855]  Why were those kids lined up with their parents?
[02:47:19.135 --> 02:47:19.995]  Why were they summoned?
[02:47:20.356 --> 02:47:22.357]  Because they hadn't gotten a chicken pox.
[02:47:23.032 --> 02:47:24.553]  Or hepatitis B shot.
[02:47:25.114 --> 02:47:26.174]  Give me a break!
[02:47:26.234 --> 02:47:27.155]  Well, let's stop right there.
[02:47:28.036 --> 02:47:30.678]  I mean, let's address and recognize you were there.
[02:47:30.738 --> 02:47:33.139]  We had other eyewitnesses on, but I didn't know you were there.
[02:47:33.159 --> 02:47:34.260]  I want you to hear you lay it out.
[02:47:35.521 --> 02:47:39.244]  There's a mass hoax where they say you'll be arrested if you don't take it.
[02:47:39.824 --> 02:47:43.707]  And then I have the state attorney on and he laughs and says, my kids don't take it.
[02:47:43.747 --> 02:47:45.128]  Yeah, Alex, I know it's not the law.
[02:47:45.508 --> 02:47:46.289]  Like it's funny.
[02:47:47.555 --> 02:47:50.936]  And they think they're there crying, thinking it's the law.
[02:47:51.296 --> 02:47:55.438]  It was a mass exercise of false arrest, of false imprisonment.
[02:47:55.478 --> 02:48:03.621]  I mean, it's just, with SWAT teams and dogs and armor and men in black and people lined up being injected, and it wasn't even a law!
[02:48:03.641 --> 02:48:04.941]  I mean, it's a crime!
[02:48:05.502 --> 02:48:09.603]  Well, you know, I have one memory that really will always stay with me.
[02:48:10.643 --> 02:48:14.985]  I was there with my son, and we had a video camera.
[02:48:15.589 --> 02:48:25.672]  And I was trying to talk with the parents who were exiting with their kids to interview them about what had happened in the courthouse since nobody was allowed in.
[02:48:26.452 --> 02:48:31.894]  And there were these cement balls that were like hundreds of feet away from the entrance.
[02:48:32.414 --> 02:48:35.095]  And I don't know why, I guess I was cool with it.
[02:48:35.475 --> 02:48:38.636]  We weren't supposed to be on the other side of the balls.
[02:48:38.696 --> 02:48:40.557]  We were supposed to be on the outer edge.
[02:48:40.939 --> 02:48:49.543]  Well, I had stepped inside, just like 12 inches, to talk to this mom who came out with her children.
[02:48:50.163 --> 02:49:03.949]  And while we were talking, one of the SWAT team, with his hand on his gun and the dog, came out of the courthouse, walking toward me.
[02:49:04.913 --> 02:49:07.794]  I'm telling you, Alex, it was like I felt this sinking.
[02:49:07.834 --> 02:49:11.755]  I felt my throat go into my stomach, you know, that kind of flash of fear.
[02:49:12.236 --> 02:49:25.620]  And I thought to myself, this must be how any person who in any time in the world who has come up against the power of the state felt when they knew that that power was coming toward them.
[02:49:25.780 --> 02:49:28.041]  And it was, I thought, this is so inappropriate.
[02:49:28.601 --> 02:49:30.542]  I did get on, he motioned for me.
[02:49:31.007 --> 02:49:35.918]  He directed me, as he walked toward me with that dog, to get on the other side of that cement ball.
[02:49:36.359 --> 02:49:39.446]  Now, it was just such an inappropriate...
[02:49:40.444 --> 02:49:40.884]  No, no, no.
[02:49:40.944 --> 02:49:41.625]  Stop, stop.
[02:49:41.665 --> 02:49:42.766]  It wasn't inappropriate.
[02:49:43.046 --> 02:49:45.127]  It was hardcore, vicious tyranny.
[02:49:45.428 --> 02:49:49.591]  And once we cowed at them, you go to DC, New York, cops say, no cameras.
[02:49:49.631 --> 02:49:50.051]  Turn them off.
[02:49:50.071 --> 02:49:51.432]  We're going to watch you with our cameras.
[02:49:51.792 --> 02:49:52.833]  It's just, you're a slave.
[02:49:52.893 --> 02:49:54.214]  Get down there and lick my boots.
[02:49:54.574 --> 02:49:58.897]  And meanwhile, those cops are shooting their kids up, and their kids are doing this, and the cops are high-fiving.
[02:49:58.937 --> 02:50:03.560]  It's just, it's really fun to serve the system and be evil and to not care.
[02:50:03.821 --> 02:50:07.984]  And I saw the dogs and the cops, and they tell them to stand there like this, going,
[02:50:08.744 --> 02:50:20.490]  We have video on the upcoming film, the Obama Deception, with just cops in New York, literally, with black helmets going... I mean, it's total tyranny, and you're the enemy because you've got a video camera.
[02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:21.131]  You're the enemy.
[02:50:21.171 --> 02:50:23.312]  You're trying to talk to other slaves.
[02:50:23.352 --> 02:50:24.873]  You're trying to interface.
[02:50:24.933 --> 02:50:26.814]  He's gotta stop you.
[02:50:27.314 --> 02:50:28.655]  I mean, what a slob.
[02:50:28.715 --> 02:50:29.695]  What a piece of crap.
[02:50:29.755 --> 02:50:30.356]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:50:30.396 --> 02:50:30.776]  Go ahead.
[02:50:31.256 --> 02:50:37.520]  Well, it was something that I just never thought that I would experience in America, and that is why I
[02:50:39.020 --> 02:50:43.423]  I felt really sad that day, and I wrote a blog about it.
[02:50:43.463 --> 02:51:05.799]  I have a blog, vaccineawakening.blogspot.com, where I have commentary on what I see happening, and since I've been doing this for 27 years, I kind of have a perspective, you know, on how this has evolved, and I do share your concern about the erosion of civil liberties and this sort of like Big Brother type
[02:51:06.578 --> 02:51:07.218]  I don't know.
[02:51:24.554 --> 02:51:25.315]  Absolutely.
[02:51:25.375 --> 02:51:29.559]  Again, the police nationwide are being trained to forcibly inject you and your family.
[02:51:29.579 --> 02:51:33.643]  They've hired 26,000 clergy response team preachers to brainwash their flock for it.
[02:51:34.064 --> 02:51:37.067]  Don't take those special shots during the emergency.
[02:51:38.008 --> 02:51:39.129]  They're soft kill weapons.
[02:51:39.809 --> 02:51:40.710]  We have the documents.
[02:51:41.311 --> 02:51:42.913]  Be aware of the eugenics operation.
[02:51:42.973 --> 02:51:43.893]  Makes Hitler look tame.
[02:51:44.915 --> 02:51:45.795]  Detoxify.
[02:51:45.855 --> 02:51:50.316]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[02:51:50.456 --> 02:51:56.218]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[02:51:56.438 --> 02:52:00.219]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective Keelermax.
[02:52:00.339 --> 02:52:05.300]  With the help of Nutriodine, Keelermax will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins and chemicals.
[02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:11.023]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins and fluoride, bromine and chloride.
[02:52:11.163 --> 02:52:15.105]  Add Malignoblock to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[02:52:15.185 --> 02:52:19.768]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[02:52:19.988 --> 02:52:26.492]  And Nutratrala to recycle all fat and water-soluble antioxidant cellular protection enzymes and molecules.
[02:52:26.632 --> 02:52:28.873]  Keeler Max and Dr. Bill's Oral Detox.
[02:52:29.113 --> 02:52:30.734]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:52:30.754 --> 02:52:33.617]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:52:33.637 --> 02:52:35.478]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:52:35.538 --> 02:52:37.860]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:38.801]  It is essential that
[02:52:58.012 --> 02:52:58.252]  I'm good.
[02:53:17.970 --> 02:53:20.612]  ...directly to your computer or iPhone and share it with others.
[02:53:20.972 --> 02:53:26.797]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[02:53:26.957 --> 02:53:31.500]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:53:31.801 --> 02:53:34.303]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:53:34.663 --> 02:53:36.324]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:36.704 --> 02:53:38.486]  Burn the info bombs to disk.

[02:53:42.609 --> 02:53:43.349]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:44.548 --> 02:53:47.789]  What are you going to do if your family has no food in the event of an emergency?
[02:53:48.009 --> 02:53:51.010]  Do you really want to find out and gamble with your family's lives?

[02:54:13.717 --> 02:54:15.198]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[02:54:15.318 --> 02:54:19.621]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, and inflation?
[02:54:19.861 --> 02:54:23.484]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[02:54:23.584 --> 02:54:23.824]  Thank you.
[02:54:46.897 --> 02:54:50.479]  I'll be back live with an abbreviated transmission this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:50.519 --> 02:54:51.559]  Central Standard Time.
[02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:54.141]  That's 5 to 7 Eastern.
[02:54:55.281 --> 02:55:01.405]  Barbara Lowe Fisher, I'm going to get her back up in the next few weeks for two hours to really break things down and talk about solutions to fight this.
[02:55:03.024 --> 02:55:07.288]  But I want to take a call or two from Linda and Sarah, maybe Dozer and Adam, we'll see in the time we have left.
[02:55:08.429 --> 02:55:11.491]  Don't forget, The Obama Deception is already on sale right now, the new film.
[02:55:11.952 --> 02:55:13.413]  Be sure to be here the first to get that.
[02:55:13.613 --> 02:55:15.795]  Infowars.com, TheObamaDeception.net.
[02:55:16.215 --> 02:55:17.837]  You can find out more right there.
[02:55:19.778 --> 02:55:26.684]  Barbara, we've been, at PrisonPlanet.tv, we've been putting your blog and the National Vaccine Information Center website up.
[02:55:27.165 --> 02:55:29.367]  But audibly, give everybody those website addresses.
[02:55:30.049 --> 02:55:43.515]  Yes, www.nvic.org, that's for National Vaccine Information Center, nvic.org, and the blog is vaccineawakening.blogspot.com.
[02:55:43.896 --> 02:55:49.318]  Or just Google Barbara Lowe Fisher, and I see you out there fighting everywhere, and you've gained so much credibility over the years.
[02:55:49.338 --> 02:55:56.261]  I even see you on a lot of mainstream television, and it seems like we're winning the fight to wake people up, but we're losing the fight with them forcing it on us.
[02:55:56.541 --> 02:55:57.422]  I see an explosion.
[02:55:58.588 --> 02:56:00.831]  I do see a train crash coming.
[02:56:00.951 --> 02:56:16.166]  I think that as the people become more enlightened, as they understand and have the information, and certainly the internet in the last decade has really brought this information to the people that they didn't have access to before.
[02:56:16.847 --> 02:56:21.732]  And the internet is a way for people to communicate with each other around the world.
[02:56:22.265 --> 02:56:26.247]  So those in power are having a hard time controlling the information.
[02:56:26.347 --> 02:56:31.471]  So they've got to have a cop with a German Shepherd and a gun marched towards a woman with her little boy.
[02:56:32.071 --> 02:56:36.053]  Now expanding on that, I want to take a call or two here.
[02:56:36.113 --> 02:56:40.196]  I wish we had more time, but unfortunately the show is basically over.
[02:56:41.536 --> 02:56:44.758]  But if you're a police officer, government bureaucrat, this is hurting your children too.
[02:56:44.818 --> 02:56:45.699]  You're with the people.
[02:56:46.519 --> 02:56:50.522]  I can't understand how these control freaks in government relish lying and forcing vaccines.
[02:56:51.288 --> 02:57:11.540]  Well, you know, remember, you know, I remember when the Berlin Wall went up and I remember when it fell and I remember when the guards were told to shoot the people who were trying to go over the Berlin Wall and at some point they just laid down their guns and said, we're not going to shoot anymore.
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:16.683]  And you know, I've always predicted that we were going to go through a period of great oppression.
[02:57:17.561 --> 02:57:30.985]  Before we are going to break through to what I call an awakening, which is why I call my blog A Vaccine Awakening, I think that we may be entering a time where we will have oppression, but the people, I believe in the power of the people.
[02:57:31.165 --> 02:57:42.308]  I believe in their common sense and in their wisdom, and ultimately they will do what they need to do to protect the biological integrity of themselves and their children, because our children is all we have.
[02:57:42.828 --> 02:57:43.688]  That is the future.
[02:57:44.304 --> 02:57:46.165]  And we have the biological imperative.
[02:57:46.545 --> 02:57:51.707]  It dictates that we must protect the genetic integrity of our children and biological integrity.
[02:57:51.747 --> 02:57:56.088]  So, I believe that people will ultimately win, but I think there will be a lot of suffering in between.
[02:57:56.108 --> 02:57:56.609]  That's right.
[02:57:56.629 --> 02:57:58.129]  And the mercury actually attacks the DNA.
[02:57:58.149 --> 02:57:58.970]  That's what you're alluding to.
[02:57:59.450 --> 02:58:02.071]  I apologize to Linda, Sarah, Dozer, Adam, and others.
[02:58:02.091 --> 02:58:02.731]  We're just out of time.
[02:58:03.091 --> 02:58:13.355]  Barbara, I always forget to have you on, and I know you're very busy, but can I have my producer right now look at your book and set you up for two hours in the next few weeks so we can
[02:58:13.795 --> 02:58:20.319]  These people are calling in with stories of killing their children or maiming them, so we can take calls and go through and cover more of the carnage.
[02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:22.581]  Okay, I'll hang on.
[02:58:23.201 --> 02:58:26.564]  Okay, yeah, let's do this, right now.
[02:58:26.584 --> 02:58:27.404]  Everyone call me back.
[02:58:27.965 --> 02:58:39.873]  Yeah, I'm going to have, on this number, I'm going to have Rob call you back and set you up right now, but one more time, give folks those websites so they can see all the documentation.
[02:58:40.433 --> 02:58:50.174]  It's www.nvic for National Vaccine Information Center, nvic.org and vaccineawakening.blogspot.com.
[02:58:51.263 --> 02:58:52.103]  Yes, okay, thank you.
[02:58:52.123 --> 02:58:54.724]  Rob's going to call you right now, okay?
[02:58:55.124 --> 02:58:55.304]  Okay.
[02:58:55.844 --> 02:58:57.364]  Thank you so much, and God bless you.
[02:58:58.205 --> 02:58:58.665]  Take care.
[02:59:00.825 --> 02:59:01.465]  We're out of time.
[02:59:01.505 --> 02:59:03.766]  This show is all about solutions.
[02:59:04.326 --> 02:59:10.388]  Showing you how something's hurting you, showing you how there's the tyranny, so you have the right to say no and empower yourself.
[02:59:10.448 --> 02:59:12.028]  The state's rights issues, all of it.
[02:59:12.348 --> 02:59:13.128]  God bless you all.
[02:59:13.168 --> 02:59:15.069]  See you back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:59:15.369 --> 02:59:19.450]  Retransmission until then starts at PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net.
[02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:22.272]  And of course, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:22.312 --> 02:59:23.674]  Get out there and wake people up.
[02:59:23.714 --> 02:59:24.435]  Fight tyranny.
[02:59:25.276 --> 02:59:26.638]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:59:26.678 --> 02:59:31.103]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:59:34.363 --> 02:59:35.925]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:59:36.045 --> 02:59:40.672]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:59:40.792 --> 02:59:43.536]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:43.756 --> 02:59:46.620]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:46.800 --> 02:59:51.527]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:51.727 --> 02:59:52.668]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:52.869 --> 02:59:55.813]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:56.113 --> 03:00:03.003]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:00:03.103 --> 03:00:06.227]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:00:06.387 --> 03:00:06.648]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:00:08.971 --> 03:00:09.411]  You have the
[03:00:38.901 --> 03:00:39.407]  This is the show.
