[00:00:01.191 --> 00:00:01.611]  Michigan.
[00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.376]  You're not allowed to do that anymore.
[00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:06.539]  You don't have free association in America.
[00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:11.126]  Here is a London Mirror story.
[00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:13.528]  Our UK children law is too strict.
[00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:17.009]  It says you're not even allowed to talk to your neighbor's kids.
[00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:22.632]  You're not allowed to babysit them or have them come over in the morning before they get on the government training center bus.
[00:00:23.332 --> 00:00:27.554]  Now, this dovetails with Obama saying he wants year-round school.
[00:00:28.174 --> 00:00:30.596]  President Obama and year-round school.
[00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:32.437]  School is forever.
[00:00:32.857 --> 00:00:35.178]  Obama would curtail summer vacation.
[00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:37.239]  That's Associated Press right here.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.081]  This is why he wants the televised announcements to the kids.
[00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.782]  This is the federal government.
[00:00:43.822 --> 00:00:45.302]  I've read their policy reports on air.
[00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:47.223]  We've had the former head, No.
[00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:49.524]  2 position, Department of Education on Charlotte Isserby.
[00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:51.144]  In fact, let's set her back up about this.
[00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:52.785]  They told her in the 80s.
[00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:53.685]  That's why she left.
[00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:57.206]  They said, we're going to take over the family through the school.
[00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:58.387]  We're going to outlaw the family.
[00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:05.189]  Now remember, $15 million fine the second time you have a garage sale that's unauthorized.
[00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.790]  Are you selling any recalled products?
[00:01:08.563 --> 00:01:17.426]  The animal ID, the premises ID, government documents to be able to have a solar panel.
[00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:19.066]  We just talked about that last segment.
[00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:21.427]  Let's go to her right now in Michigan.
[00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:24.988]  Lisa Snyder in this 1984 world.
[00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:26.849]  Lisa, thank you for joining us.
[00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.849]  Thank you for having me.
[00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.156]  Okay, you've been on the national news, but just sound bites.
[00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:33.037]  You've got the floor for the next ten minutes or so.
[00:01:33.217 --> 00:01:33.458]  Okay.
[00:01:33.498 --> 00:01:34.758]  Tell folks what happened.
[00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.819]  Break down what you're facing.
[00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.842]  But first, you just heard my breakdown of government taking over society.
[00:01:42.162 --> 00:01:43.423]  Were you aware of that angle?
[00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:44.403]  No, I was not.
[00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:46.485]  What do you think of the statements I just made?
[00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:48.826]  It's stupid.
[00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:54.649]  It's bad, and yeah, the government doesn't need to stick their nose where it doesn't belong.
[00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:56.406]  Absolutely.
[00:01:56.466 --> 00:02:00.651]  Okay, tell us how this started, how you became a 1984 criminal.
[00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:01.612]  My law was 1973.
[00:02:01.652 --> 00:02:04.495]  The law that they say I was breaking, it's the Act No.
[00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:04.576]  116 of 1973.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.823]  But the point is they're now trying to enforce this similarly worldwide.
[00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:16.944]  The CPS.
[00:02:17.284 --> 00:02:18.605]  Who tattled on you?
[00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:20.506]  I mean, break it down for us.
[00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:21.147]  Okay.
[00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:25.770]  My house is a bus stop for the children of our neighborhood.
[00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:34.796]  I have an older son and my friends have older children that now, our youngest ones, don't ride the bus anymore.
[00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:38.679]  They all rode together, but now the older ones go off and the younger ones are left behind.
[00:02:39.645 --> 00:02:48.828]  So my daughter did not want to get on the bus by herself, so we just thought it was a great idea to get the kids together, to get on the bus together, so that they were, um, they felt safe.
[00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.469]  Two of them are five, two of them are seven.
[00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.752]  Of course, you know, they don't have, um, they just feel scared.
[00:02:58.212 --> 00:03:00.693]  So we planned this two days into it.
[00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:12.055]  I received, it was, the letter that I received was September 11th, but I didn't receive it until the following week, that I was providing care for unrelated children in my home.
[00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:15.556]  So I called the DHS and said, I don't understand this.
[00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.337]  I am not doing anything wrong.
[00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.517]  There is a bus stop.
[00:03:18.857 --> 00:03:19.558]  They do come in.
[00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:26.717]  If it's cold outside, if it's raining, we live in Michigan, the weather can be funny one minute and snowing the next.
[00:03:27.418 --> 00:03:33.001]  And I said, you know this, you live in Michigan, and she said, I said, what do you want me to do when it's raining outside?
[00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:35.863]  And she told me to tell their parents to buy them an umbrella.
[00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:38.375]  So they're now your God.
[00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:44.318]  I mean, they're now going to tell you that you can't have neighbors' kids wait in your front room when it's cold outside.
[00:03:45.638 --> 00:03:47.879]  These are our new Soviet minders.
[00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.942]  I mean, I want this to really hit people that the Amish are having their kids taken
[00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:58.185]  They're not letting people sell eggs and watermelons on the side of the highway anymore across the country.
[00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:03.687]  They're SWAT teaming them, having undercovers come buy watermelons and then SWAT team them.
[00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:08.610]  I mean, the government has run out of real criminals to feed on.
[00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.771]  We're now dinner.
[00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:12.112]  So what happened next?
[00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:16.394]  So I just kept talking to her and saying, okay, can they at least be in my garage?
[00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:18.195]  No, because the garage is a part of the house.
[00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:19.136]  I can't even do that.
[00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:27.441]  So, um, I just got really angry and I told her that I had to stop talking cause she, I mean, what she was saying did not make sense.
[00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:33.584]  So then my friend wrote to Brian Kelly and he jumped aboard immediately and said, this is ridiculous.
[00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:37.667]  It's such a broad law that, um,
[00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:47.632]  It doesn't, there's such a broad spectrum that it needs to be, you know, you need to have facts.
[00:04:47.832 --> 00:04:49.293]  There's no facts in this law.
[00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:51.274]  I mean, it can be for babysitting.
[00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.256]  It can be for a play date.
[00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:55.257]  My daughter has a little girl over.
[00:04:55.277 --> 00:05:03.863]  I was told that I need to ask her parents if they go out to dinner, if they're going out to dinner or to a movie or whatever, that is considered daycare.
[00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.884]  But if they go home, then it's okay.
[00:05:05.964 --> 00:05:07.045]  I'm like, I'm not going to ask that.
[00:05:07.065 --> 00:05:07.685]  That's retarded.
[00:05:07.705 --> 00:05:08.586]  No ma'am, come on.
[00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:16.129]  You've got to ask permission if you take your daughter and her little friend to McDonald's to have a happy meal.
[00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:18.570]  Look, are you Al Qaeda or something?
[00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.290]  I mean, airport security.
[00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.611]  America is now secure.
[00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:24.132]  They want to put metal detectors in shopping malls.
[00:05:24.652 --> 00:05:28.293]  You need to ask CPS permission to go have a hamburger.
[00:05:28.313 --> 00:05:29.474]  Yeah, well, no.
[00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:32.375]  I have to ask them to have my kids have playdates.
[00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.921]  That's freedom!
[00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:42.639]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, the veterans fought and died so that you wouldn't have permission to take the neighbor's child for hamburger.
[00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.052]  You've got to get government permission, not the parents.
[00:05:46.072 --> 00:05:47.853]  But see, I'm going to stop being sarcastic.
[00:05:47.893 --> 00:05:49.374]  What they're doing is setting a precedent.
[00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:55.359]  And worldwide, they're making these announcements that you can't keep your neighbor's kids, you can't even have kids' neighbors over.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.044]  I had a Wall Street Journal reporter here who was in England, and she was taking photographs of a famous river.
[00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:03.505]  No children were even there.
[00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:05.447]  And people, police came up and said,
[00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:08.148]  You can't photograph the river.
[00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:09.889]  There may be a child somewhere on the river.
[00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:10.829]  This is pedophilia.
[00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:11.710]  Are you a pedophile?
[00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:19.974]  So it's about government teaching us all we're criminals so that we can all be inducted basically into this prison system.
[00:06:20.294 --> 00:06:29.999]  So you've got a state rep involved trying to pass a law because they've passed a previous law they're now implementing saying you can't have a playdate with the neighbors.
[00:06:30.717 --> 00:06:34.582]  Yeah, well, and then the governor is on board, too, because she did not know.
[00:06:34.642 --> 00:06:43.372]  I guess she must not have realized that this was going on, and now she has jumped aboard and wants this taken care of immediately, because it is ridiculous.
[00:06:43.472 --> 00:06:45.515]  It's the dumbest wall that's out there.
[00:06:45.995 --> 00:06:48.618]  We, as Americans, live in the free world.
[00:06:48.678 --> 00:06:49.580]  We should be able to
[00:06:51.272 --> 00:06:52.173]  Yeah, no.
[00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:19.963]  So, I mean, it doesn't matter if you're a good mother when it's freezing cold and gets below zero, trying to let neighborhood kids duck in for a few minutes.
[00:07:20.043 --> 00:07:21.403]  You're not allowed.
[00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.143]  What, you think this is America or something?
[00:07:23.163 --> 00:07:24.624]  Yeah.
[00:07:26.784 --> 00:07:29.685]  So, what is the slimy CPS doing?
[00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:34.306]  Did you find out who reported you to the Bureau of Family Destruction?
[00:07:34.866 --> 00:07:35.786]  I did not, no.
[00:07:37.847 --> 00:07:43.028]  I mean, have you asked the... Ma'am, did you know how CPS was set up?
[00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:45.044]  Do I?
[00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:45.507]  No.
[00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:49.970]  Well, let me just tell you, because you're influential, you're talking to a lot of folks.
[00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:54.232]  Family court was set up to carry out eugenics, the sterilization.
[00:07:54.452 --> 00:07:56.333]  You know, Hitler got his eugenics from us.
[00:07:57.773 --> 00:07:59.214]  I made a film about it called Endgame.
[00:07:59.454 --> 00:08:03.816]  And so that's why these family courts are outside of the regular courts and due process.
[00:08:04.176 --> 00:08:15.781]  And that's why their agents can get away with all this, because 80, 90 years ago, or even in the 30s, 75, 80 years ago, these were the people that would come grab you and your kid and go sterilize you.
[00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:16.261]  Did you know that?
[00:08:19.705 --> 00:08:20.806]  Had you ever heard about that?
[00:08:21.106 --> 00:08:21.846]  No, I haven't.
[00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:34.033]  Well, listen, I know that sounds crazy, but if you just Google endgame eugenics, you can watch the actual government film clips where they had the movie reels teaching parents that this was OK.
[00:08:34.353 --> 00:08:39.196]  So we have this vestigial, you know, leftover Hitlerian system.
[00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:41.937]  Well, I mean, here's an example for you.
[00:08:45.303 --> 00:08:51.066]  How is there even a spy network to know that you had neighbor kids over before they caught the bus?
[00:08:51.326 --> 00:08:52.146]  I have no idea.
[00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.187]  I mean, does that sound like Nazi Germany?
[00:08:54.907 --> 00:08:55.287]  Well, no.
[00:08:55.387 --> 00:09:10.814]  It's just a nosy neighbor that, um... I guess that... We don't know which neighbor, but I just think that someone must be very unhappy or, I don't know, thought that they would get... I don't know what they thought, actually.
[00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:13.495]  It's just a sad, sad, um...
[00:09:16.152 --> 00:09:21.574]  Well, the family is a unit that, according to the Department of Education, must be destroyed and replaced by the state.
[00:09:22.214 --> 00:09:24.655]  The individual must owe their allegiance to the state.
[00:09:25.235 --> 00:09:31.517]  That's why they put all the pressures they can on communities, so community collapses, so all that's left is the government.
[00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:38.059]  And that's why CPS is five times more likely to abuse children than any other group.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.200]  What are the children doing now that winter's coming on?
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.021]  I guess they just freeze outside?
[00:09:44.031 --> 00:10:02.801]  No, um, well, I'm still, I mean, I am well within my 28 days of, I only watched them, um, the one little boy, the one little boy stopped coming, but the other little boy, I still have like 26 more days to go before, and he only goes to school every other day, so I'm okay.
[00:10:03.622 --> 00:10:06.463]  Well, I think the CPS workers playing God should be fired.
[00:10:07.244 --> 00:10:10.526]  Have you heard they're telling people they can't have neighbors over for Bible study now?
[00:10:11.385 --> 00:10:11.885]  I have not.
[00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:13.266]  All over the country.
[00:10:13.286 --> 00:10:17.589]  Yeah, we're told, we're being told, isn't free association the most basic thing?
[00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.130]  Isn't it the parents' decision?
[00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:19.510]  Right.
[00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.671]  If their children stay at your house, not the government?
[00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:22.211]  Right.
[00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:31.997]  That's what our whole, um, this whole uproar is, is because, you know, as a parent, they know me, they know my morals, they know how I bring up my children.
[00:10:32.377 --> 00:10:34.459]  They know that their children are going to be safe.
[00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:38.761]  Did you hear about California saying parents can't homeschool?
[00:10:39.382 --> 00:10:39.942]  No, I haven't.
[00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:41.466]  What do you think about that?
[00:10:41.486 --> 00:10:42.547]  That's retarded.
[00:10:43.547 --> 00:10:45.567]  I mean, the government is saying they own us.
[00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:47.508]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:50.189]  We really appreciate you joining us.
[00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:52.169]  An amazing lady standing up to Big Brother.
[00:10:52.469 --> 00:10:53.830]  Most people submit.
[00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.030]  They're telling people here in Austin they can't have neighbors over.
[00:10:57.351 --> 00:10:57.831]  That's right.
[00:10:57.951 --> 00:10:58.671]  We're all prisoners.

[00:11:58.194 --> 00:12:00.496]  The best filtered water in the world.
[00:12:01.857 --> 00:12:07.083]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:13.199]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:12:13.739 --> 00:12:19.942]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:12:20.222 --> 00:12:22.043]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:12:22.203 --> 00:12:24.604]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:12:24.664 --> 00:12:35.568]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:39.125]  It's not about left or right.
[00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:40.946]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:47.727]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:12:56.549 --> 00:12:57.690]  The Obama Deception.
[00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.310]  The people strike back.
[00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:02.621]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:08.144]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:13:08.324 --> 00:13:08.744]  I get it.
[00:13:08.885 --> 00:13:18.249]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:13:18.489 --> 00:13:19.690]  That's not what's happening.
[00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:24.252]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[00:13:24.492 --> 00:13:26.172]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[00:13:26.332 --> 00:13:28.153]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[00:13:28.373 --> 00:13:31.634]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:13:31.774 --> 00:13:35.855]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:13:36.035 --> 00:13:37.595]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:40.856]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:45.217]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:13:45.397 --> 00:13:46.117]  You should, too.
[00:13:46.317 --> 00:13:47.277]  Find out what they know.
[00:13:47.457 --> 00:13:50.698]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[00:13:51.138 --> 00:13:51.339]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:14:01.332 --> 00:14:10.160]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[00:14:54.676 --> 00:14:57.299]  The entire United States and Western world are being converted to a giant prison grid.
[00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.213]  I'm going to do a few more minutes here with Lisa Schneider.
[00:15:12.613 --> 00:15:13.574]  I talked to her during the break.
[00:15:13.594 --> 00:15:15.116]  She pretty much knows the neighbor who did it.
[00:15:15.557 --> 00:15:17.298]  She doesn't want to get in a fracas with him.
[00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:22.124]  I warned her that this neighbor is going to now be watching.
[00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:26.288]  If one of her little kids is in the backyard for five minutes alone, they're going to claim it's abuse.
[00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:30.002]  I think you've got to run this person to ground.
[00:15:30.042 --> 00:15:32.804]  You've got to maybe countersue them for false reports or something.
[00:15:33.104 --> 00:15:35.786]  Or they're going to be hunting you with the CPS.
[00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:39.107]  Because for these little Stasi types, they're never wrong.
[00:15:39.167 --> 00:15:40.348]  They love the big state.
[00:15:40.388 --> 00:15:41.769]  They love what's happening.
[00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:44.750]  But comment on that and then where all this is going.
[00:15:45.131 --> 00:15:53.255]  As you're being told, it's illegal in the freezing Michigan Blue Northerns to let any neighbor kids come in and wait for the bus.
[00:15:54.219 --> 00:16:08.045]  Um, as an American, that we are supposed to be living in a land of the free, I believe, truthfully, and all the other mothers do that are involved in this, is that the government should not be able to tell us who we can have watch our children.
[00:16:08.085 --> 00:16:13.087]  If we know our children are in a safe place, that's, I mean, the parents, it's the parents' right.
[00:16:14.867 --> 00:16:19.230]  Having these children, as a mother of these children, they know, they know they're in a safe place.
[00:16:19.931 --> 00:16:28.477]  Second, as far as the neighbor, yeah, I just, we're, my husband and I are not, we just want this all to go away.
[00:16:29.138 --> 00:16:34.302]  And just, hopefully they'll leave us alone and hopefully this will all come to an end.
[00:16:34.402 --> 00:16:42.408]  And I hope that the law does get changed because it's a terrible law and I hope no other mother has to go through what I've had to go through.
[00:16:43.637 --> 00:16:53.787]  I do thank everyone for the support that they have given all of us, and I don't take that for granted for one minute, but this was a very sad situation.
[00:16:53.867 --> 00:17:08.941]  It has hurt my children along with all the other children that are involved, and that's the most upsetting thing is whoever did this, if they were coming after any of us adults, that's one thing, but to hurt our children, that's horrid, horrid, horrid.
[00:17:09.241 --> 00:17:15.645]  Well, they started this in the last 20 years using a few bad examples of bad daycares.
[00:17:15.665 --> 00:17:22.189]  But there's nobody regulating the CPS who, again, is five times more likely to abuse children than any other group or even government itself.
[00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.311]  So they have no business.
[00:17:24.331 --> 00:17:27.353]  That's the pot calling the kettle black here.
[00:17:27.893 --> 00:17:31.055]  But notice, mothers and fathers know what a good daycare is.
[00:17:31.455 --> 00:17:36.999]  The CPS use the daycares as tattletale grounds to hunt for kids to CPS and take.
[00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:43.423]  And so when we let the CPS get into regulating daycares, they now have taken that over.
[00:17:43.843 --> 00:17:50.027]  And then now they're trying to say we can't even have our own homes, or can't have neighbors over for church, for a Bible study.
[00:17:50.087 --> 00:17:52.729]  They're destroying the right of free association.
[00:17:52.769 --> 00:17:54.130]  They're muscling in.
[00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.350]  And the same thing.
[00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:57.072]  Parents know what a good daycare is.
[00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:58.352]  We don't need the state.
[00:17:58.613 --> 00:18:00.394]  And parents know if their kid's allowed to
[00:18:00.874 --> 00:18:03.637]  Go stay for 20 minutes in the foyer of a neighbor's house.
[00:18:03.937 --> 00:18:06.059]  That happened when I was a little kid.
[00:18:06.399 --> 00:18:07.240]  That's normal.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.742]  My mom had neighbor kids over.
[00:18:09.142 --> 00:18:10.163]  Neighbors had me over.
[00:18:10.503 --> 00:18:11.685]  That is freedom.
[00:18:11.985 --> 00:18:12.505]  Right.
[00:18:12.585 --> 00:18:13.727]  And this is serious tyranny.
[00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:14.107]  Go ahead.
[00:18:14.167 --> 00:18:21.915]  Well, and also I'd like to say, all because the daycare is licensed does not mean that you know who is actually working.
[00:18:21.995 --> 00:18:24.177]  You don't know nothing about their background.
[00:18:26.129 --> 00:18:27.870]  You don't have dinner with them every night.
[00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.091]  You don't socialize with those people.
[00:18:30.591 --> 00:18:35.934]  Usually, you just send your kid to this licensed daycare that's licensed by the state.
[00:18:36.634 --> 00:18:39.915]  But, who is actually really watching your children?
[00:18:39.935 --> 00:18:40.376]  That's right.
[00:18:40.416 --> 00:18:42.717]  That means you've just paid protection money to the government.
[00:18:42.737 --> 00:18:43.237]  That's right!
[00:18:43.597 --> 00:18:47.779]  A neighbor who you know and trust is a lot better than some nameless school.
[00:18:48.139 --> 00:18:48.399]  Right.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:49.660]  Exactly.
[00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:53.088]  And that was our other point that we are trying to make.
[00:18:53.168 --> 00:18:58.811]  At least they know, I mean, we have dinner together, we're with these people practically every day of the week.
[00:18:59.231 --> 00:19:00.832]  They know us, we know them.
[00:19:01.512 --> 00:19:03.954]  You put your kid in a daycare, you don't know them.
[00:19:04.034 --> 00:19:05.374]  You just hope that you know them.
[00:19:05.814 --> 00:19:09.676]  Well, this lets us know the mindset of the government bureaucrats.
[00:19:10.037 --> 00:19:15.579]  They believe you can't have neighbor kids over before they catch the school bus, even if the neighbor parents want them there.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.542]  They believe that someone owning their own property can't have ten cars parked
[00:19:21.042 --> 00:19:24.486]  On their rural property to have Sunday dinner and prayer.
[00:19:24.867 --> 00:19:30.714]  They believe rabbis in Denver can't have 14 of their members over.
[00:19:31.014 --> 00:19:33.998]  They believe Buddhists can't have five of their friends over.
[00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:37.903]  They believe Amish can't sell watermelons without a license.
[00:19:38.363 --> 00:19:39.183]  On the side of the road.
[00:19:39.523 --> 00:19:43.224]  They believe they're God and they're here to milk us and run our lives.
[00:19:43.264 --> 00:19:49.926]  And under this new greenhouse gas tax bill, it says unlimited power, home inspections, everything.
[00:19:50.426 --> 00:19:56.828]  And the colleges are churning out armies of control freaks who love ruling over people.
[00:19:57.088 --> 00:20:00.969]  We better get control of our country and we better stand up and say no like you did.
[00:20:00.989 --> 00:20:02.149]  I salute your courage.
[00:20:02.309 --> 00:20:02.729]  Thank you.
[00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:06.870]  And any other mother that's in our situation, stand up for your rights because you're teaching your kids.
[00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:11.371]  My children came to me and said, I thank you mom for standing up for us.
[00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:20.514]  And I believe that if my child, my children were ever put in the situation that I was, I'm hoping that I have taught them that you stand up for the right because you are an American and you do have the right.
[00:20:20.534 --> 00:20:24.875]  Well, I mean, in the Soviet Union, they let neighbor kids stay at neighbor's houses.
[00:20:24.935 --> 00:20:29.157]  This is worse than malice China, worse than Soviet Russia.
[00:20:29.917 --> 00:20:31.517]  Lisa Snyder, God bless you.
[00:20:31.537 --> 00:20:32.538]  We appreciate your courage.
[00:20:32.578 --> 00:20:34.578]  We'll watch this case as it develops.
[00:20:34.698 --> 00:20:35.199]  Godspeed.
[00:20:35.499 --> 00:20:35.959]  Thank you.
[00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:37.884]  What an amazing lady.
[00:20:38.104 --> 00:20:39.384]  Most people just roll over.
[00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.225]  The bureaucrats say, good!
[00:20:41.785 --> 00:20:42.546]  We own you now.
[00:20:42.946 --> 00:20:43.806]  You're our slaves.
[00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:48.829]  But come back, take your phone calls, get into the flu, the war, the new stimulus package.
[00:20:49.069 --> 00:20:49.869]  It's all coming up.
[00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:52.370]  We're on the march.
[00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.471]  The empire's on the run.
[00:20:55.392 --> 00:20:58.073]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:04.165]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:21:04.585 --> 00:21:09.546]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:21:09.907 --> 00:21:11.627]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:21:11.947 --> 00:21:16.769]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:21:16.949 --> 00:21:17.909]  How much do you want?
[00:21:18.129 --> 00:21:18.889]  When do you want it?
[00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.850]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:21.970]  When will you need it?
[00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.271]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:21:24.411 --> 00:21:25.511]  Will there be any food?
[00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:27.072]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:21:27.312 --> 00:21:32.356]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:21:32.536 --> 00:21:35.759]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:21:36.139 --> 00:21:39.642]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:21:39.942 --> 00:21:40.943]  How much will you need?
[00:21:41.183 --> 00:21:41.804]  We don't know.
[00:21:42.084 --> 00:21:43.004]  How much do you want?
[00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:43.925]  All you can get.
[00:21:44.105 --> 00:21:44.806]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:45.206 --> 00:21:47.969]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:21:48.249 --> 00:21:50.011]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:21:50.031 --> 00:21:50.952]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:05.836]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:22:05.976 --> 00:22:07.899]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:10.342]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:22:10.502 --> 00:22:12.345]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[00:23:01.015 --> 00:23:04.977]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[00:23:05.277 --> 00:23:09.318]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[00:23:09.558 --> 00:23:19.982]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[00:23:20.383 --> 00:23:29.206]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful immune system-building blocks defending your body against natural and man-made viruses, but they also assist your body in healing
[00:23:31.642 --> 00:23:32.223]  We're good to go.
[00:24:04.157 --> 00:24:18.527]  We better recognize that there is a unified global corporate government telling people in Australia, in England, in the United States, in Canada, and Europe-wide, you don't have neighbor kids over.
[00:24:31.078 --> 00:24:34.041]  In England they're saying you gotta have a license to even talk to kids.
[00:24:35.402 --> 00:24:42.269]  They're making everybody learn that they're a terrorist, that they're bad, that they're not allowed to talk to their neighbors.
[00:24:48.295 --> 00:24:50.578]  And they're coming into every facet of life.
[00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:59.472]  They're actually in major cities, like Tulsa, Oklahoma, with the headline, Licenses Proposed for Gardens.
[00:24:59.932 --> 00:25:03.197]  With the city councilman saying, they may grow marijuana.
[00:25:03.777 --> 00:25:05.560]  So you're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.301]  It's bad!
[00:25:07.342 --> 00:25:08.283]  In your backyard.
[00:25:08.343 --> 00:25:10.926]  And see, because the council doesn't control that.
[00:25:10.946 --> 00:25:11.606]  And they're God.
[00:25:11.666 --> 00:25:12.447]  They run your life.
[00:25:12.487 --> 00:25:13.408]  You are their slave.
[00:25:13.748 --> 00:25:15.390]  In and enough, you pay all the taxes.
[00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.352]  And pay the cops when they pull you over.
[00:25:17.692 --> 00:25:18.893]  And pay all the regulations.
[00:25:18.933 --> 00:25:21.836]  And kiss their butt and call them authorities and officials.
[00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:39.000]  You're going to have your entire life run by them and there's the city councilman in the paper going, yeah, everybody's getting into gardens and we don't know what's being grown and we need to have the police inspect your gardens to license them because there might be marijuana.
[00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:50.248]  And I've done a lot of stories, covered a lot of stories here in Austin of, in one case, an old lady, no criminal record, lived in her little house,
[00:25:51.778 --> 00:25:52.738]  Out in Travis County.
[00:25:53.318 --> 00:25:54.139]  By Spicewood.
[00:25:55.539 --> 00:25:56.659]  Right by Pootie's Bar.
[00:25:56.999 --> 00:25:59.300]  One of Willie Nelson's stagehand's bars.
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.601]  And, uh... They SWAT teamed her.
[00:26:05.621 --> 00:26:08.282]  She had bloodweed growing in the forest down the hill from her.
[00:26:08.582 --> 00:26:10.083]  Everybody knows bloodweed grows everywhere.
[00:26:10.103 --> 00:26:11.423]  Doesn't even look anything like marijuana.
[00:26:11.983 --> 00:26:13.864]  They came in, laughed about the bloodweed.
[00:26:14.224 --> 00:26:15.004]  Kicked her dog.
[00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:19.225]  Tore everything apart.
[00:26:20.734 --> 00:26:26.218]  Went in a rent house she had on the property, pulled out a guy's Playboy magazine, and made fun of it in front of him.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.902]  Now that's how America operates.
[00:26:32.943 --> 00:26:36.346]  Meanwhile, the government ships in the majority of the narcotics to carry all of this out.
[00:26:36.906 --> 00:26:39.929]  They want in your life, period.
[00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:46.614]  And that's what this new government policy imposes strict standards on garage sales.
[00:26:49.048 --> 00:26:58.798]  Americans who slap $1 price tags on their used possessions at garage sales or bizarre events risk a $15 million fine thanks to new government campaign.
[00:26:58.818 --> 00:26:59.578]  That's Fox News.
[00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:01.881]  I have McClatchy Newspapers here.
[00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:03.342]  Seller beware!
[00:27:03.462 --> 00:27:05.444]  Feds cracking down on garage sales.
[00:27:06.845 --> 00:27:13.372]  And when I printed both of these articles, they had ads to become a police officer on the sides of each one.
[00:27:17.236 --> 00:27:23.882]  Not just because that's what the cookies show that it was a cop article, an article about police, but that that's just the major ads now.
[00:27:23.962 --> 00:27:25.124]  That's... Look!
[00:27:27.486 --> 00:27:31.169]  About once a year, I'll go to Toys R Us to buy a bike or something for my kids.
[00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:39.117]  And every time I walk in, there's a big board hanging on the wall of files of the recalls.
[00:27:39.397 --> 00:27:40.198]  Thousands of them.
[00:27:40.718 --> 00:27:41.099]  Per year.
[00:27:42.697 --> 00:27:47.601]  They say for 10 years, you've got to go check on an online registry of all the recalled toys.
[00:27:47.882 --> 00:27:48.662]  That's just toys.
[00:27:49.503 --> 00:27:53.086]  Everything else, as high as 10% of things get recalled.
[00:27:53.387 --> 00:27:54.528]  No one knows all this.
[00:27:54.588 --> 00:27:56.089]  No one knows where they got a table.
[00:27:56.429 --> 00:27:59.232]  No one knows where this mouse came from if it gets recalled.
[00:27:59.532 --> 00:28:02.335]  I don't have time to sit there and read hundreds of documents.
[00:28:02.755 --> 00:28:04.777]  There's a 10% chance this has been recalled.
[00:28:05.057 --> 00:28:06.458]  It's got some lead part in it.
[00:28:07.159 --> 00:28:10.561]  Hell, more than half the milk products for kids have got melamine in it.
[00:28:10.581 --> 00:28:14.363]  Instead of recalling it though, they just say, oh, melamine's good for you now.
[00:28:18.044 --> 00:28:24.148]  Many different inks that you print with get recalled now with all sorts of poison in it from China and the U.S.
[00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:28.750]  Upwards of 10% of products are recalled.
[00:28:29.662 --> 00:28:46.112]  One time my wife got freaked out about it about two, three years ago, and that was really big news, and she found out the little color, little blue table we got with a red, yellow, and green chair for kids from Target was recalled, and she freaked out and took it back, and then she found out this was, she's like, my God, this is recalled!
[00:28:46.332 --> 00:28:47.152]  This is recalled!
[00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:48.073]  This is recalled!
[00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:53.776]  And pretty soon I said, yeah, just anything made in China, you can forget it.
[00:28:57.785 --> 00:29:03.289]  See, because they've got to store that toxic waste from all their chemical plants and all their microchip plants.
[00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.573]  Just like they had fluoride in the 40s after World War II, they said, hell, dump it in the water.
[00:29:09.354 --> 00:29:15.559]  Because they've been doing that in Tennessee at the nuke plants, the byproduct of making the uranium rods and the plutonium rods.
[00:29:17.369 --> 00:29:18.330]  Manly uranium rods.
[00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:19.891]  They've been dumping it in the water.
[00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.353]  And they said, hell, the public didn't notice.
[00:29:22.974 --> 00:29:23.974]  So they dump it in the water.
[00:29:24.235 --> 00:29:30.920]  China, dumps it in your cereal, dumps it in your baby formula, dumps it in your drugs, dumps it in the paint.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.664]  Paint's a great place to mix poison up, because it congeals and freezes.
[00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:38.986]  So, you now are supposed to
[00:29:40.302 --> 00:29:55.854]  No, tens of thousands of products that have been recalled, and you're supposed to then not... And they say they're already, under the federal stimulus money, paying for local cops to be federalized, and it's already being reported they're coming up and writing people $100,000 tickets.
[00:29:59.073 --> 00:30:02.960]  And they come in with a computer laptop without a warrant.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.282]  Search everything you've got.
[00:30:04.563 --> 00:30:08.991]  You sit there going, I was just trying to clean out the garage.
[00:30:09.171 --> 00:30:09.692]  Shut up!
[00:30:10.453 --> 00:30:11.515]  Shut up, Al-Qaeda!
[00:30:12.702 --> 00:30:14.483]  And you think I'm joking?
[00:30:14.663 --> 00:30:20.086]  I get reports every day or two of them SWAT teaming Amish, SWAT teaming farmers and ranchers.
[00:30:20.386 --> 00:30:27.290]  They don't just come and fine you in all these states now saying you can't sell eggs or watermelons or squash or whatever without a permit.
[00:30:27.591 --> 00:30:29.952]  They now send SWAT teams!
[00:30:31.533 --> 00:30:33.274]  We've had the farmers on the show!
[00:30:34.034 --> 00:30:35.775]  They, look, they're rogue!
[00:30:35.955 --> 00:30:36.716]  They're criminal!
[00:30:39.241 --> 00:30:51.185]  I mean, I think about how it's in the news every week, how different Texas towns just pull over old ladies, pull over people and rob the hell out of them, and people get on the news and make excuses.
[00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:52.465]  They go, yeah, we take your money.
[00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:56.226]  By the way, me and my family and cousins run the town.
[00:30:56.746 --> 00:30:58.787]  There's nothing that ain't gonna do!
[00:31:00.347 --> 00:31:01.988]  And it's just like Hardin.
[00:31:02.388 --> 00:31:08.250]  The entire town hates the private con artists with 14 felonies coming in and taking over the prison and policing people.
[00:31:09.366 --> 00:31:15.271]  But every one of the locals that's in power just sits there and goes, how about you get the hell out of here?
[00:31:15.671 --> 00:31:16.131]  Literally.
[00:31:16.592 --> 00:31:18.093]  We're going to keep running things.
[00:31:18.573 --> 00:31:21.776]  Damn right, we're going to throw the local slobs in there and make a little money.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.761]  Oh, we're not going to let you.
[00:31:29.042 --> 00:31:34.986]  Oh, you think you're going to have two or three of the neighbor kids when it's sleeting outside Michigan 20 below?
[00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:38.422]  As it is on average about a month out of the year.
[00:31:38.902 --> 00:31:42.543]  You think you're gonna have kids come in and stand under your porch?
[00:31:42.983 --> 00:31:44.684]  They're not gonna stand in your garage?
[00:31:45.084 --> 00:31:47.145]  And the lady's like, well, can I have them stand in the garage?
[00:31:48.725 --> 00:31:49.585]  No, slave!
[00:31:50.206 --> 00:31:52.306]  You get one hour out in the yard a day.
[00:31:52.466 --> 00:31:54.327]  You pay me everything you produce.
[00:31:54.887 --> 00:31:55.968]  It's all pimp game.
[00:31:56.008 --> 00:31:59.209]  It's like, my bitches pay me 110% back.
[00:31:59.629 --> 00:32:01.189]  And they're like, I just love you, baby.
[00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:04.871]  They were telling me a story about some HBO special about pimps.
[00:32:04.911 --> 00:32:05.551]  What was the name of the movie?
[00:32:08.783 --> 00:32:10.124]  Pimp's up, hoe's down.
[00:32:11.164 --> 00:32:13.225]  And Hartman, go ahead and come on the mic and describe it.
[00:32:14.085 --> 00:32:23.149]  Because, I mean, Hartman tells the story good, but this lady's been in a car wreck or shot and she's just telling the pimp, I'm sorry baby, I'm gonna get you the money, I'm gonna get you everything you need, homeland security.
[00:32:23.469 --> 00:32:25.030]  And that's how it is with this government.
[00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.750]  It's just like, you're gonna give us more.
[00:32:26.991 --> 00:32:28.251]  We're foreign bank run.
[00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:29.512]  We're gonna, I'm going to your calls in a moment.
[00:32:29.772 --> 00:32:32.133]  We're gonna take everything you got and you're gonna beg us.
[00:32:32.153 --> 00:32:32.413]  Go ahead.
[00:32:33.553 --> 00:32:37.707]  Oh yeah, just talking about the pimps up, hoes down.
[00:32:39.511 --> 00:32:42.513]  Yeah, there's a portion of there where I believe it's Pimpin' Ken.
[00:32:42.553 --> 00:32:45.656]  He's a notorious, infamous pimp from way back in the day.
[00:32:45.816 --> 00:32:51.941]  Rappers rap about him all the time and he had one of his workers that got beat up and shot, stabbed, the whole nine.
[00:32:53.382 --> 00:33:00.327]  He gets to the hospital and the young lady is laying in the hospital bed just saying, Oh baby, I'm gonna get back on them streets.
[00:33:00.347 --> 00:33:01.949]  I'm gonna get that money for you, baby.
[00:33:02.349 --> 00:33:03.170]  Don't worry about me.
[00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:03.710]  I'm all right.
[00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:05.992]  I just want to get up out this bed and make this money for you.
[00:33:06.804 --> 00:33:09.605]  And the mom is sitting right there and looking at Pimpin' Can.
[00:33:09.625 --> 00:33:11.566]  It's like, what have you done to my baby?
[00:33:12.446 --> 00:33:17.108]  And just later on he talks about the percentage of the cut.
[00:33:17.428 --> 00:33:20.730]  He's like, well, how much do you give your employees?
[00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.730]  10%?
[00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.551]  5%?
[00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.551]  Like, hell no, I don't give them nothing.
[00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:25.211]  That's my money.
[00:33:25.932 --> 00:33:26.912]  I'll give them some chicken.
[00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:28.513]  I'll give them a bucket of chicken.
[00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:37.667]  No, that's all about the game right there, you know, just, I guess, psychologically raping you.
[00:33:38.307 --> 00:33:40.369]  And I found that with women.
[00:33:41.371 --> 00:33:44.174]  I didn't know why in high school, I wasn't mean to women, but I didn't care.
[00:33:44.194 --> 00:33:51.481]  I was just out of my mind on testosterone, you know, growing up.
[00:33:54.164 --> 00:33:55.766]  That's why the bad guys always get the girls.
[00:33:55.826 --> 00:33:59.831]  But society, now that men have been feminized, that's how this works.
[00:34:00.191 --> 00:34:04.236]  When those locals running that town go, we're going to have a felon run things, hell yeah!
[00:34:04.796 --> 00:34:05.577]  No problem with it.
[00:34:06.536 --> 00:34:10.378]  That is just exercising power over us, and that's what government's doing.
[00:34:10.438 --> 00:34:13.939]  It's consciously breaking our back, and I watch these people.
[00:34:13.999 --> 00:34:18.861]  I watch the troops as they die of the vaccines, as they get ripped off, as they got to pay for their own health care.
[00:34:18.881 --> 00:34:20.522]  They're just like, I just appreciate the government.
[00:34:20.802 --> 00:34:25.684]  I just worship the government, and it's a broken back, capitulated, totally
[00:34:27.355 --> 00:34:29.497]  Totally broken.
[00:34:29.838 --> 00:34:33.882]  It's a broken society who just want to be lied to.
[00:34:34.162 --> 00:34:35.664]  They want to feed their kids melamine.
[00:34:35.684 --> 00:34:36.705]  They want to take shots.
[00:34:36.725 --> 00:34:38.086]  They want their kids to be retarded.
[00:34:38.307 --> 00:34:39.368]  They want to be lied to.
[00:34:39.708 --> 00:34:41.170]  They want to be scammed and gamed.
[00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:46.135]  And they love to worship the military and worship cops and worship all of this.
[00:34:46.355 --> 00:34:47.056]  It's just sick.
[00:34:47.076 --> 00:34:49.859]  Yeah, it's almost like people
[00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:54.793]  Get the okey-doke pulled on them so many times that they're dizzy.
[00:34:54.994 --> 00:34:59.496]  They're just dizzy from the okey-dokes and now they'll just, they'll take whatever is given to them.
[00:34:59.516 --> 00:35:00.557]  They'll just go along.
[00:35:00.677 --> 00:35:01.878]  It's the herd mentality.
[00:35:01.958 --> 00:35:03.979]  And translate okey-doke, the scam.
[00:35:04.259 --> 00:35:07.801]  Yeah, yeah, it's the dipsy-doo-dungaroo, you know what I mean?
[00:35:08.501 --> 00:35:10.142]  The total flip of the script.
[00:35:10.783 --> 00:35:11.783]  They're crunkin'.
[00:35:11.983 --> 00:35:12.304]  Yeah.
[00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:15.226]  Yeah, they just get so crunkenized.
[00:35:15.286 --> 00:35:19.249]  They're preoccupied with the fantasy football team.
[00:35:19.309 --> 00:35:27.435]  Well, that's the thing though, is that they'll all smile, and I saw this in Hardin, and get like a little demon look in their eyes, and like go, it's mine.
[00:35:27.675 --> 00:35:28.456]  I like being caught.
[00:35:30.177 --> 00:35:31.097]  And I don't understand.
[00:35:31.117 --> 00:35:32.578]  It's like, hey, you're being conned.
[00:35:32.598 --> 00:35:33.258]  I'm like, I like it.
[00:35:33.478 --> 00:35:33.858]  I like it.
[00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:35.359]  Because it's like yuppies.
[00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:38.020]  They'll go, hey, Trans Texas Corridor is foreign owned.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.040]  It's taking over.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:39.741]  It's a scam.
[00:35:39.781 --> 00:35:41.041]  We pay to be their slave.
[00:35:41.621 --> 00:35:43.902]  Or, hey, $23.7 trillion.
[00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:46.163]  We pay interest on the money we give the banks.
[00:35:46.463 --> 00:35:49.424]  And yuppies will like giggle and go, I got a Mercedes.
[00:35:49.785 --> 00:35:52.385]  You know, it's like, it's like, ooh, I like it.
[00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:53.466]  And it's like, don't you?
[00:35:53.846 --> 00:35:54.946]  Man, I'm telling you, we're in trouble.
[00:35:55.546 --> 00:36:11.450]  Man, it's almost as if I've said this before, but you know when you work out and you get sore or if you play, when you're a kid you play football or whatever sport and you're sore, you're beaten up afterwards and for whatever reason, that next day it hurts, but it feels good.
[00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:13.910]  And it's like that's what's going on.
[00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.431]  People just getting beat up and, you know, having to play the game.
[00:36:18.402 --> 00:36:22.903]  And they don't even understand that they're beaten down and sore and for whatever reason.
[00:36:22.923 --> 00:36:27.004]  Exactly, but I mean they revel in being scammed.
[00:36:27.104 --> 00:36:27.704]  They love it.
[00:36:29.664 --> 00:36:30.704]  Alright, good job Hartman.
[00:36:30.724 --> 00:36:31.705]  I appreciate you coming in.
[00:36:31.725 --> 00:36:34.665]  Now ladies and gentlemen, I mean this is the pimp game.
[00:36:35.765 --> 00:36:43.127]  And now again, locals that were awake, they were upset about what had happened.
[00:36:43.647 --> 00:36:44.727]  They understood the scam.
[00:36:44.747 --> 00:36:46.048]  Their eyes were alive.
[00:36:46.088 --> 00:36:47.668]  They had very sad concern.
[00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.610]  But then you had all the fat cats.
[00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:58.793]  And I mean, folks, a fat cat was somebody that owned, you know, a dry cleaners or somebody that owned a tiny restaurant.
[00:36:59.313 --> 00:37:03.395]  And they would just strut around and tell you, I'm pretty important in this town.
[00:37:03.915 --> 00:37:06.115]  And I like American police force.
[00:37:06.556 --> 00:37:07.856]  And I go, you don't care he's a felon.
[00:37:07.876 --> 00:37:08.976]  They go, no, I like it.
[00:37:09.577 --> 00:37:10.437]  And I would just be going.
[00:37:10.737 --> 00:37:13.898]  They like, now, why don't you get the hell out of here, foreigner?
[00:37:16.158 --> 00:37:18.419]  And I'm like, but he's the foreigner running a scam on you.
[00:37:18.479 --> 00:37:20.920]  You want him running around locking up locals in the private jail.
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.240]  They're like, yeah, I do.
[00:37:24.181 --> 00:37:25.381]  And I walked into the sheriff's department.
[00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:26.201]  I'd like to meet with the sheriff.
[00:37:26.422 --> 00:37:27.142]  He's not here.
[00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:28.962]  Deputy Sheriff, maybe later.
[00:37:28.982 --> 00:37:35.805]  And then, and the woman was so cowardly behind the bighorn sheriff's department thing that when I was looking her in the eyes, she was acting nice.
[00:37:36.809 --> 00:37:41.453]  But like a dog, as soon as we turned to walk out, she bulled up and came in the doorway.
[00:37:41.473 --> 00:37:42.934]  It was like primitive.
[00:37:42.974 --> 00:37:47.277]  Like she was a chicken with her, you know, like running us off.
[00:37:47.538 --> 00:37:51.701]  And she got out in the doorway and said, by the way, we don't like people from out of town.
[00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:52.322]  Tell us what to do.
[00:37:52.642 --> 00:37:54.423]  And this town was good before you came in.
[00:37:54.924 --> 00:37:57.626]  And we like American police force.
[00:37:59.067 --> 00:37:59.988]  And we like what they're doing.
[00:38:00.068 --> 00:38:01.369]  And I'm like, oh, really?
[00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:02.370]  You like the felon?
[00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.453]  Gonna take over and even the sheriff likes it!
[00:38:06.893 --> 00:38:09.316]  Now, just get on out of here!
[00:38:11.445 --> 00:38:17.990]  Because, see, to her it doesn't matter if she's being scammed, as long as she doesn't think she's being scammed.
[00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.511]  See, I'm the bad one.
[00:38:19.972 --> 00:38:22.834]  I'm telling you the Federal Reserve is private and totally raping us.
[00:38:23.154 --> 00:38:30.820]  I'm telling you they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and writing giant textbooks about how they're doing it, like Ecoscience by the White House science are.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.662]  I mean, these bastards admit they're poisoning us.
[00:38:34.003 --> 00:38:36.725]  And I got stacks of news of the shots jacking everybody up.
[00:38:39.022 --> 00:38:41.023]  But now I'm beginning to understand psychology more.
[00:38:41.644 --> 00:38:48.669]  If you try to walk up to some crack whore wearing a wig because her hair is falling out and she's only got one tooth, she's going, ahhh.
[00:38:48.869 --> 00:38:55.093]  That's why those crack whores get like that, because the pimps give them nothing but maybe a little bit of chicken and a little bit of crack, just enough.
[00:38:55.173 --> 00:38:56.594]  And they're like zombies, folks.
[00:38:56.935 --> 00:38:57.755]  They're under a spell.
[00:38:58.015 --> 00:39:01.478]  And if you tried to walk up to them and go, ahhh.
[00:39:01.798 --> 00:39:10.565]  If you try to walk up to them and say, let me get you to rehab, let me get you off this, the pimp is abusing you, you don't talk bad about Leroy, mother, I'm calling it!
[00:39:10.966 --> 00:39:12.227]  I'll jack you up!
[00:39:12.807 --> 00:39:14.649]  I mean, literally.
[00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:16.510]  Literally.
[00:39:18.111 --> 00:39:19.032]  I grew up in Dallas, folks.
[00:39:19.072 --> 00:39:20.914]  I've seen plenty of crack whores, and that's how it is.
[00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:26.728]  I've talked to pastors that have tried to get them off the street and help them, and that's exactly what they... and it's the general public.
[00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:28.849]  They're just like, I love being scammed!
[00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.250]  I love being lied to!
[00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.231]  I love being defrauded!
[00:39:32.551 --> 00:39:33.172]  I love it!
[00:39:33.532 --> 00:39:34.152]  I love it!
[00:39:34.532 --> 00:39:35.133]  I love it!
[00:39:35.493 --> 00:39:36.033]  I love it!
[00:39:37.674 --> 00:39:38.935]  And so the new rule of order just says...
[00:39:41.601 --> 00:39:43.162]  How do we make all these people prisoners?
[00:39:43.382 --> 00:39:44.523]  How do we suck everything?
[00:39:44.743 --> 00:39:46.004]  How do we make them slaves again?
[00:39:46.545 --> 00:39:47.565]  Say it's to save the earth?
[00:39:47.906 --> 00:39:48.646]  Tax air!
[00:39:48.927 --> 00:39:49.387]  Ha ha!
[00:39:49.527 --> 00:39:49.887]  Yeah!
[00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:51.208]  They'll love it!
[00:39:51.528 --> 00:39:53.110]  Oh, it's such a big scam, they're gonna love it!
[00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.931]  And then they come out and do it!
[00:39:55.612 --> 00:39:57.233]  And lie to you, and know they're lying.
[00:39:57.973 --> 00:40:01.896]  And we'll tell them they can't have neighbor kids over at the bus stop.
[00:40:01.936 --> 00:40:04.338]  We'll tell them they can't sell watermelons on the street corner.
[00:40:04.798 --> 00:40:06.320]  And watch the little slaves, they'll do it!
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.562]  And all the dramas and sitcoms and TV shows worship cops and worship military.
[00:40:13.502 --> 00:40:14.783]  The police have been militarized.
[00:40:14.803 --> 00:40:16.503]  They've been trained to kill people and break things.
[00:40:17.183 --> 00:40:19.424]  The military is designed to kill people and break things.
[00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:27.847]  This is not our military that fought in 1776 or Mexico attacked us, went down to Mexico and kicked their butt and came back.
[00:40:28.787 --> 00:40:30.508]  This is an imperial military now.
[00:40:32.054 --> 00:40:35.036]  Working for people that want to bring this country down.
[00:40:35.096 --> 00:40:37.777]  And they are training the military to occupy the U.S.
[00:40:38.097 --> 00:40:42.119]  and now admitting it and training them their number one enemy is conservatives and gun owners.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:48.062]  And now good old boys are going, I guess I'll turn my guns in because I love Petraeus.
[00:40:50.824 --> 00:40:53.705]  And I'm like, but the flag symbolizes the Bill of Rights.
[00:40:53.725 --> 00:40:54.726]  They're like, shut up!
[00:40:56.195 --> 00:41:02.439]  If they say it's conservative, and you see the American flag right there, that means police state.
[00:41:03.319 --> 00:41:04.840]  That means no rights at all.
[00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:11.104]  Why don't you just leave America if you don't like the army deploying on the streets?
[00:41:12.805 --> 00:41:14.466]  Some kind of liberal commie.
[00:41:16.907 --> 00:41:17.747]  Oh, look at that, yeah.
[00:41:18.168 --> 00:41:25.312]  All the major phone companies, all the major cable guys, all the major groups are openly announcing they're spying on you.
[00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.615]  And they openly trained the plumber groups, everybody.
[00:41:29.675 --> 00:41:32.780]  When they're in your house, without a warrant, they're spying on you.
[00:41:33.301 --> 00:41:34.083]  And I told the story.
[00:41:34.103 --> 00:41:35.345]  I'm going to take calls and get to it later.
[00:41:35.365 --> 00:41:36.407]  I'm going to tell it in detail.
[00:41:37.386 --> 00:41:55.483]  I'm about to go home, Saturday morning, I'm going up the elevator, it opens on the third floor on the wrong floor, and there's Girl Scouts with police and Homeland Security, and I wasn't expecting it, so I stepped out, looked at it for about 10 seconds, and then actually started panicking, hitting the button, because it was too hard, it was like Body Snatcher!
[00:41:55.503 --> 00:41:58.706]  I was like, get me the hell out of here, what the hell, I'm in the Soviet Union!
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.583]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[00:42:58.902 --> 00:43:06.924]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:43:07.164 --> 00:43:08.504]  And we knew what to do.
[00:43:08.524 --> 00:43:10.244]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:43:10.484 --> 00:43:16.905]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:43:17.505 --> 00:43:26.027]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:33.220]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.564]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:43:36.685 --> 00:43:41.771]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

[00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:21.112]  Huge big developments there.

[00:45:36.896 --> 00:45:39.420]  You get Fall of the Republic early.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:44.247]  We're probably going to be able to ship it out a few days early from the October release date.
[00:45:44.267 --> 00:45:49.214]  So if you want to be the first people to get the DVD, it's shipped out in the order it is received.
[00:45:50.094 --> 00:45:53.797]  And I've hired some extra seasonal people so we can ship this out, boom, really fast.
[00:45:54.337 --> 00:45:56.299]  So get your order in for Fall of the Republic.
[00:45:56.359 --> 00:45:58.360]  Go read about it at Infowars.com.
[00:45:59.061 --> 00:46:01.443]  It is the highest budget, most powerful film I've made.
[00:46:01.483 --> 00:46:06.907]  The banking takeover, the carbon tax takeover, the police state tattletale spy takeover.
[00:46:07.347 --> 00:46:09.489]  We expose the warmongering of both parties.
[00:46:10.209 --> 00:46:13.692]  You want to understand who the Globalists are and what their operation is, this is the film.
[00:46:13.812 --> 00:46:17.795]  Alan Watson and so many others.
[00:46:19.266 --> 00:46:21.367]  John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:46:21.407 --> 00:46:22.487]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:46:23.768 --> 00:46:24.628]  Follow theRepublic.
[00:46:24.708 --> 00:46:27.490]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.690]  888-253-3139.
[00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:37.314]  You'll also be able to see it coming up October 21st in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, for all the great members of that.
[00:46:38.474 --> 00:46:48.579]  Okay, Josh Smith was with us at the G20, saw all the hellish stuff that happened up there, with the LRADs being used on citizens, no protest allowed in the city, just like Communist China.
[00:46:49.753 --> 00:46:52.254]  Not allowed to have neighbor kids over, not allowed to have a farmer's market.
[00:46:52.415 --> 00:46:53.215]  It's the new America.
[00:46:53.875 --> 00:46:58.558]  Sidney Sheehan was just arrested at the White House for protesting the Afghan war.
[00:46:58.598 --> 00:47:00.299]  Not allowed to protest without a permit.
[00:47:00.499 --> 00:47:01.540]  They don't issue permits.
[00:47:03.025 --> 00:47:05.166]  Josh Smith is associate of Cindy Sheehan.
[00:47:05.206 --> 00:47:06.827]  We met him at the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[00:47:07.467 --> 00:47:10.069]  And they are the true anti-war people.
[00:47:10.129 --> 00:47:17.272]  As Obama expands the war, the military gripes at him for not enough troops to give him left cover, to give a false choice.
[00:47:18.033 --> 00:47:20.494]  Josh, tell us what just happened there in D.C.
[00:47:21.695 --> 00:47:25.817]  We came to the White House, Alex, with three to four hundred people.
[00:47:26.317 --> 00:47:31.820]  We were just protesting directly across Lafayette Park at the fence of the White House.
[00:47:32.406 --> 00:47:40.408]  We had four main groups with us, which were Veterans for Peace, World Can't Wait, and the March of Death group.
[00:47:40.428 --> 00:47:42.868]  They do a kind of a performance act.
[00:47:42.888 --> 00:47:43.608]  With the coffins?
[00:47:44.388 --> 00:47:44.969]  Yeah, yes.
[00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:47.269]  Coffins, and they all lay down in the white masks.
[00:47:48.269 --> 00:47:52.370]  And Cindy chained herself to the fence.
[00:47:53.590 --> 00:48:01.292]  And they went after her first, and they took everybody off the sidewalk with the big horses and threatened to
[00:48:02.062 --> 00:48:03.963]  You know, basically run you over.
[00:48:04.863 --> 00:48:08.145]  And, uh, they've got about... Yeah, see, in China, they would stop with the tanks.
[00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:09.866]  Not at G-20, not here.
[00:48:10.126 --> 00:48:11.626]  They'll go ahead and run you over.
[00:48:11.907 --> 00:48:13.107]  They'll go ahead and attack you.
[00:48:13.387 --> 00:48:15.548]  They'll come up to women, full power, the belly club.
[00:48:15.588 --> 00:48:19.690]  And I've watched police over and over again, just with every bit of power, HYAH!
[00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:21.431]  You're just, like, really trying to kill you.
[00:48:21.451 --> 00:48:23.172]  And that's like, yeah, I love the police!
[00:48:23.472 --> 00:48:24.352]  I love the military!
[00:48:24.372 --> 00:48:25.653]  They work for the foreign banks!
[00:48:25.973 --> 00:48:26.593]  Rape us!
[00:48:26.633 --> 00:48:27.414]  We love it!
[00:48:27.754 --> 00:48:28.454]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:48:29.074 --> 00:48:29.555]  Yes, Alex.
[00:48:30.819 --> 00:48:34.380]  We were initially told and warned many times to get off the sidewalk.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:35.661]  We were pushed into the streets.
[00:48:36.321 --> 00:48:39.062]  Then we were pushed off the streets back into Lafayette Park.
[00:48:39.642 --> 00:48:46.605]  Then we had our lawyers from the National Lawyer Guild come out and contest everything that they were trying to do against us.
[00:48:47.465 --> 00:48:53.808]  They backed off for a while, but then they rolled in buses, about three buses, and they're still putting people in there now.
[00:48:54.248 --> 00:48:59.610]  I just saw David Swanson, the writer, author, he was just arrested and put in a bus.
[00:49:00.327 --> 00:49:02.028]  They're arresting women.
[00:49:03.068 --> 00:49:05.730]  There's many priests that are in handcuffs right now.
[00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:07.811]  And they said at the G-22, no protest allowed.
[00:49:07.831 --> 00:49:09.311]  We have the police chief on video.
[00:49:09.671 --> 00:49:10.932]  This is the new America.
[00:49:11.452 --> 00:49:13.453]  They told us we did not have a permit.
[00:49:13.493 --> 00:49:15.934]  We pulled out a pocket copy of the Constitution.
[00:49:16.355 --> 00:49:18.556]  And we told them, here's our permit right here.
[00:49:19.476 --> 00:49:20.717]  I talked to a guy yesterday.
[00:49:20.777 --> 00:49:22.497]  The police came in his house without a warrant.
[00:49:23.678 --> 00:49:25.459]  And he said, hey, I have a Constitution.
[00:49:25.479 --> 00:49:27.560]  And the guy said, what are you, one of them truthers?
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.062]  So, I mean, they just flip out.
[00:49:31.142 --> 00:49:33.624]  Stay there for one minute, so we're going to come back and get some more news from you.
[00:49:33.945 --> 00:49:39.049]  Then I promise we're going to go to your calls and take a lot of them at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.051]  We just reached the halfway point in transmission.
[00:49:43.433 --> 00:49:45.015]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:49:45.936 --> 00:49:48.258]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:49:50.862 --> 00:49:54.846]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:49:55.106 --> 00:49:56.888]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:49:57.108 --> 00:50:05.396]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:50:05.637 --> 00:50:10.862]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:50:11.182 --> 00:50:12.804]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:50:13.044 --> 00:50:19.366]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:50:19.546 --> 00:50:30.310]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:31.110]  That's right.
[00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:33.671]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:50:33.931 --> 00:50:35.491]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[00:50:37.472 --> 00:50:37.912]  Big Brother.
[00:51:06.866 --> 00:51:07.886]  Mainstream media.
[00:51:08.627 --> 00:51:09.707]  Government cover-ups.
[00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:11.187]  You want answers?
[00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:12.888]  Well, so does he.
[00:51:13.528 --> 00:51:17.109]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:17.709 --> 00:51:21.771]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:37.550]  Alright, Cindy Sheehan dared not allowed to protest in D.C., not allowed to protest at G20.
[00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:38.971]  I've been in D.C.
[00:51:39.711 --> 00:51:40.991]  several times the last few years.
[00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:46.012]  You can be 200 yards away from the Washington Monument, they walk over and say, no videotaping.
[00:51:46.732 --> 00:51:49.513]  And of course, if you call the city, they then say, well, there's no permit to tape.
[00:51:49.933 --> 00:51:50.533]  They don't care.
[00:51:50.593 --> 00:51:53.534]  They've been told to let you know you are lower than dirt.
[00:51:54.294 --> 00:51:55.734]  You will be harassed more in D.C.
[00:51:55.754 --> 00:51:59.555]  than you will be in Beijing, outside the Forbidden City.
[00:52:01.363 --> 00:52:04.705]  This is not Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, folks, and they're letting you know!
[00:52:05.186 --> 00:52:11.730]  You're here to pay money to offshore banks, and to give your kids over to CPS, and to supply kids for the military.
[00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:12.530]  That's it.
[00:52:14.412 --> 00:52:16.273]  You think you're allowed to have free association?
[00:52:16.313 --> 00:52:17.594]  You think you're allowed to protest?
[00:52:18.274 --> 00:52:21.096]  Well, we're allowed to fracture your skull with a billy club.
[00:52:21.856 --> 00:52:29.982]  Josh Smith finishing up with the police state you're witnessing as they're arresting peaceful protesters at Lafayette Park across the street from the Puppet House.
[00:52:30.919 --> 00:52:32.660]  Yes, very much Alex.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.582]  Cindy Sheehan is arrested.
[00:52:35.602 --> 00:52:38.103]  I want to make it very clear that here in D.C.
[00:52:38.123 --> 00:52:46.608]  today and at the G20 in Pittsburgh, the only people instigating any conflict or any violence are the police.
[00:52:48.789 --> 00:52:50.650]  Well, they've got a severe hatred of this country.
[00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:55.232]  I mean, that's what I've noticed is they revel in what they do.
[00:52:55.292 --> 00:52:58.514]  They enjoy it.
[00:52:58.614 --> 00:52:59.695]  They are itching.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:00.782]  I think so.
[00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:23.617]  I know, and that doesn't mean all police, but whoever they're selecting for these riot teams or for these police squads, these protest squads, whoever they're, or maybe it's the mass psychology, I don't know, but Rob Dew has been officially charged, by the way.
[00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:35.083]  They charged him, yeah, they charged him for the 24th, not the 25th, the Friday that he was at, they blocked him off at a park, wouldn't let him leave.
[00:53:36.072 --> 00:53:36.793]  And then arrested him.
[00:53:37.093 --> 00:53:38.013]  It's all on video.
[00:53:38.754 --> 00:53:41.356]  He wasn't even at the University, the 24th.
[00:53:41.696 --> 00:53:43.177]  They have charged him with that.
[00:53:44.438 --> 00:53:46.799]  Wrong day, wrong place, and they don't care.
[00:53:46.839 --> 00:53:48.160]  They say, we're going to court with it.
[00:53:49.021 --> 00:53:51.182]  And it doesn't matter if we got the wrong day down.
[00:53:52.023 --> 00:53:52.763]  We don't care.
[00:53:52.823 --> 00:53:56.286]  I mean, they're just... Well, we... I don't know what to say.
[00:53:56.306 --> 00:54:00.148]  I was down at the event Friday night where Rob was.
[00:54:00.208 --> 00:54:01.169]  I met up with Jason.
[00:54:01.969 --> 00:54:03.270]  I witnessed the...
[00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:08.082]  All sorts of, uh, the forces, police forces, military forces.
[00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:14.223]  I witnessed them attacking peaceful, innocent bystanders who were just watching what was going on.
[00:54:15.783 --> 00:54:20.264]  Yeah, they came on to the university and the news reported went into dorms looking for people.
[00:54:20.904 --> 00:54:21.104]  Yes.
[00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:25.565]  Because, see, the cops discovered they would go down empty streets, L-ratting little kids in their front yard.
[00:54:25.585 --> 00:54:26.585]  We have photos and videos.
[00:54:26.925 --> 00:54:30.026]  So they would think, where can we find people in Pittsburgh out at night?
[00:54:30.506 --> 00:54:31.246]  The university.
[00:54:33.648 --> 00:54:41.635]  They were chasing people back into the neighborhood and back across the dorms, and as they came across the dorms, they were still firing tear gas.
[00:54:42.436 --> 00:54:46.439]  I stood directly next to two students who were shot with bean bag rounds.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.403]  It was the most fascist, horrible thing I've ever seen.
[00:54:52.352 --> 00:54:55.894]  Well, I told you, they will put us in pits and put lead into us.
[00:54:56.514 --> 00:54:57.694]  Many of these people have ordered.
[00:54:57.714 --> 00:54:58.335]  They want to.
[00:54:58.395 --> 00:54:59.995]  To them, it's a macho hunting.
[00:55:01.616 --> 00:55:07.438]  They've taken their regular hunting instincts, their predator instincts, and placed it onto their fellow humans.
[00:55:07.458 --> 00:55:09.099]  That's what unjust war is.
[00:55:09.479 --> 00:55:10.520]  It's a war of aggression.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:13.121]  It is preemptive war against the people.
[00:55:13.181 --> 00:55:18.784]  They know the banks are going to steal everything, and they know we're going to resist, and so they're trying to intimidate us.
[00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:22.005]  Well, as soon as Cindy gets out, we'd like to have her on this week with us.
[00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:25.947]  Fire out the website for folks that want to try to give Cindy some support.
[00:55:27.028 --> 00:55:29.469]  Cindy Sheehan, Soapbox.com.
[00:55:29.489 --> 00:55:30.270]  It's her website.
[00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:38.634]  Also, Alex, I'd like to say that Cindy has just announced the International People's Declaration of Peace, which she just read in front of the White House.
[00:55:39.534 --> 00:55:40.455]  And got arrested for.
[00:55:42.907 --> 00:55:45.029]  And again, don't have the neighbor kids over with your kids.
[00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:46.630]  You're not allowed to without a government license.
[00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:48.491]  And don't have a garage sale or you'll get arrested.
[00:55:48.871 --> 00:55:51.013]  Don't sell eggs on a street corner or you'll get arrested.
[00:55:53.797 --> 00:55:56.860]  But if you're a foreign illegal mercenary, 14-time felon, you're good.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.662]  It's the criminal's world!
[00:55:59.002 --> 00:56:00.223]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[00:56:00.864 --> 00:56:03.786]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:56:04.247 --> 00:56:07.430]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:12.234]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:56:12.434 --> 00:56:13.856]  These emergency backup systems.
[00:56:14.036 --> 00:56:16.578]  We'll provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:56:16.978 --> 00:56:22.822]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:56:23.083 --> 00:56:26.145]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:56:26.705 --> 00:56:31.128]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:56:31.529 --> 00:56:37.833]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:56:38.093 --> 00:56:40.035]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:56:40.515 --> 00:56:43.338]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:56:43.718 --> 00:56:47.781]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.

[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.261]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:57:37.601 --> 00:57:39.841]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:44.482]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.

[00:58:01.325 --> 00:58:03.927]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:04.328 --> 00:58:09.292]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:09.672 --> 00:58:11.394]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:11.714 --> 00:58:16.519]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:16.719 --> 00:58:17.680]  How much do you want?
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.641]  When do you want it?
[00:58:19.021 --> 00:58:20.622]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:58:20.903 --> 00:58:21.723]  When will you need it?
[00:58:21.984 --> 00:58:24.045]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:58:24.185 --> 00:58:25.286]  Will there be any food?
[00:58:25.527 --> 00:58:26.828]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:58:27.028 --> 00:58:32.092]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:58:32.292 --> 00:58:35.494]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:58:35.894 --> 00:58:39.377]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:58:39.697 --> 00:58:40.698]  How much will you need?
[00:58:40.938 --> 00:58:41.539]  We don't know.
[00:58:41.839 --> 00:58:42.739]  How much do you want?
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.660]  All you can get.
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.681]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:44.961 --> 00:58:47.722]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:58:48.002 --> 00:58:49.123]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:58:50.103 --> 00:58:55.285]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:58:55.545 --> 00:58:58.206]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:58:58.346 --> 00:59:08.690]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:12.291]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:12.671 --> 00:59:14.032]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:59:16.522 --> 00:59:20.166]  I want to talk about the police state takeover.
[00:59:20.186 --> 00:59:21.767]  I want to talk more about Hardin, Montana.
[00:59:21.807 --> 00:59:24.290]  I want to get into the new stimulus plan.
[00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:26.472]  Incredible news on the flu front.
[00:59:26.492 --> 00:59:27.373]  I'm going to cover that first.
[00:59:27.813 --> 00:59:29.255]  But after, I take a bunch of calls.
[00:59:30.096 --> 00:59:31.917]  Now, these calls are going to be great.
[00:59:31.997 --> 00:59:32.758]  They're always great.
[00:59:33.199 --> 00:59:34.740]  Some are duds, but most of them are really good.
[00:59:35.721 --> 00:59:38.524]  So when we take calls, there's always a lot of great ones in there, to be technical.
[00:59:38.544 --> 00:59:39.385]  That's what I meant to say.
[00:59:42.668 --> 00:59:45.269]  But just have your point, your question ready so I can get to the next person.
[00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:46.249]  I know you've been holding a while.
[00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:51.030]  As you hear a caller hang up, that's your chance to get involved on air.
[00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:53.871]  We'd love to hear from you.
[00:59:53.891 --> 00:59:54.011]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:54.151 --> 00:59:55.491]  Let's talk to Gary in Mass.
[00:59:55.531 --> 00:59:56.851]  Gary, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:59:57.511 --> 00:59:58.152]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:59:58.252 --> 00:59:59.112]  I really appreciate it.
[00:59:59.172 --> 01:00:04.173]  Wanted to chat with you about the flu and Codex Alimentarius, if you have a minute for that.
[01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:04.393]  Sure.
[01:00:05.362 --> 01:00:06.103]  Okay, a couple things.
[01:00:06.223 --> 01:00:13.548]  If you go to flu.gov, the government talks about the seasonal flu vaccine being separate from H1N1 flu vaccines.
[01:00:14.288 --> 01:00:27.177]  And yet, we're finding that at public schools across America this week, principals are being recommended to tell all the parents to send their kids in and sign that form and don't worry, there's no H1N1 in the normal flu shot.
[01:00:27.277 --> 01:00:27.537]  And yet,
[01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:43.539]  When I go to FDA.gov and I look at every single flu manufacturer's product for normal flu shots, Flumis, Fluzone, Fluvorix, Fluvorin, they're all containing not only the squalene that we've been talking about, they all contain H1N1,
[01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:47.100]  H3N2 and something else.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:50.243]  I think Paul Watson and Curt Nemo have done reports on this.
[01:00:50.303 --> 01:00:51.444]  If they haven't, they need to.
[01:00:51.504 --> 01:00:53.285]  But yes, that is confirmed.
[01:00:54.086 --> 01:00:55.667]  That's why Horowitz flipped out.
[01:00:56.488 --> 01:01:02.052]  He noticed a month ago that they were saying their regular flu shot was going to have H1N1.
[01:01:02.433 --> 01:01:05.815]  How did they know this a year ago when this hadn't even come up on the radar?
[01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:08.678]  Then they lie and say, don't worry, it doesn't have it.
[01:01:09.238 --> 01:01:15.303]  Then they're also lying saying it's mandatory when you don't have to take the flu shot to go to school.
[01:01:15.783 --> 01:01:21.367]  So, you know, even if you're for vaccination, why are you for you and your kids being lied to?
[01:01:23.018 --> 01:01:26.501]  And yeah, the squalenes at at least five times regular levels.
[01:01:26.881 --> 01:01:27.641]  Super deadly.
[01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:28.602]  Adjuvant.
[01:01:28.942 --> 01:01:33.905]  All these top scientists and medical doctors we've had on saying that's what's frying out the brain.
[01:01:33.925 --> 01:01:36.527]  Neurological disorders.
[01:01:37.748 --> 01:01:39.029]  It just goes on and on.
[01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:41.730]  And yeah, I'm going to get into flu later.
[01:01:42.111 --> 01:01:47.134]  It's just so amazing to actually see this happening.
[01:01:48.092 --> 01:01:55.498]  And to then hear them lying and saying there's no such thing as adverse reactions, then the CDC says no, there's going to be a lot of adverse reactions, including deaths.
[01:01:56.619 --> 01:01:59.801]  I mean, it's just... But the public is gullible.
[01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:06.506]  I mean, I watch the public at bus stops and at grocery stores, and it's like they're willfully... They just look so stupid!
[01:02:07.106 --> 01:02:10.089]  And it's like self-induced.
[01:02:11.564 --> 01:02:16.627]  And I don't, I mean, I don't have some elitist view of myself, but I have become a sardonic person.
[01:02:17.147 --> 01:02:19.048]  Not in that I think I'm high and mighty.
[01:02:19.308 --> 01:02:21.669]  See, the elitists see all these dumb people and just want to kill them.
[01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:23.790]  And then try to dumb them down further.
[01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:27.592]  They're trying, you know, trying to make them stupid and dumb and mindless.
[01:02:29.173 --> 01:02:33.696]  I look at the public and it's like, dear God, they're like monkeys or something.
[01:02:33.756 --> 01:02:36.577]  I mean, they just, a monkey's less trusting than they are.
[01:02:37.297 --> 01:02:39.839]  At least animals have got a little common sense, and I, um,
[01:02:42.462 --> 01:02:43.463]  That's just so trusting.
[01:02:44.684 --> 01:02:45.485]  Anything else, Gary?
[01:02:46.005 --> 01:02:46.966]  Yeah, a couple quick things.
[01:02:47.046 --> 01:02:50.349]  So, one other point on flu and then on Codex Alimentarius.
[01:02:51.169 --> 01:02:55.173]  On the flu myth, which now that after I had a little dialogue... That was my next big point.
[01:02:55.413 --> 01:02:58.676]  I'm watching Fox today, and I already knew this, but see if it's what you're about to say.
[01:02:59.837 --> 01:03:00.957]  I'm watching Fox.
[01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:03.079]  On the treadmill.
[01:03:03.559 --> 01:03:06.642]  And they admit what doctors said two months ago here.
[01:03:06.762 --> 01:03:12.307]  That it's a live H1N1 that's quote, been weakened.
[01:03:12.327 --> 01:03:14.729]  But they said live in the flu mess.
[01:03:14.769 --> 01:03:15.871]  They had the doctor on there.
[01:03:16.671 --> 01:03:19.634]  And that if you have an autoimmune problem, don't take it.
[01:03:19.974 --> 01:03:21.556]  And that it's for people 2 to 45.
[01:03:22.437 --> 01:03:24.438]  And that that's the only one they have available.
[01:03:24.458 --> 01:03:25.780]  And it's like the cabbage patch doll.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.781]  Everybody wants to have it.
[01:03:27.461 --> 01:03:30.282]  And that it can actually spread the flu.
[01:03:30.602 --> 01:03:32.823]  So just what all the doctors said on the show.
[01:03:33.323 --> 01:03:38.184]  They're going to use a live nasal system to give people the flu.
[01:03:38.564 --> 01:03:40.545]  Then it's going to make a bunch of people sick.
[01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:43.466]  They're preconditioning that it won't make you sick.
[01:03:43.966 --> 01:03:45.046]  Then they're going to spread it.
[01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:47.907]  I mean, they are engaging in a false flag right in front of us.
[01:03:47.947 --> 01:03:48.267]  Go ahead.
[01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:54.112]  Alex, it feels like we're in a cartoon from Marvel or DC Comics.
[01:03:54.312 --> 01:03:54.832]  And you know what?
[01:03:54.852 --> 01:03:58.313]  We need more people like you as Iron Man to stop these folks.
[01:03:58.393 --> 01:04:02.354]  They are definitely spreading H1N1 through the flumos.
[01:04:02.434 --> 01:04:03.374]  It's unbelievable.
[01:04:03.414 --> 01:04:06.135]  Now, one quick thing on Codex Alimentarius.
[01:04:06.855 --> 01:04:10.236]  December 31st this year is when it starts to take effect.
[01:04:10.939 --> 01:04:17.302]  Now if you want to defend yourself against the flu, we've heard from these folks that, you know, fish oil is good, vitamin D is good, vitamin C is good.
[01:04:17.442 --> 01:04:19.964]  I've heard that in some studies, people have lived longer.
[01:04:20.584 --> 01:04:22.405]  When you and I hit 40, we should have a good life.
[01:04:22.445 --> 01:04:24.386]  The other 40 years should be just as good as the first 40.
[01:04:25.066 --> 01:04:29.869]  But because of eugenics, they want to end it sooner and make it really painful and difficult for all of us.
[01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:31.830]  Yeah, no, that's the stated plan.
[01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:33.010]  White House says so, right here.
[01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:34.551]  So look at this.
[01:04:35.051 --> 01:04:40.554]  Alex, vitamin C, they say vitamin C is a really great vitamin to defend against it, as well as D and fish oil.
[01:04:40.974 --> 01:04:48.877]  Well, vitamin C, the doctors who've done the studies, and you can Google the studies or search engine the studies, you need 3,000 to 4,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day.
[01:04:48.977 --> 01:04:49.657]  What is the U.S.
[01:04:49.697 --> 01:04:51.137]  recommended daily allowance?
[01:04:51.438 --> 01:04:51.638]  About 85.
[01:04:51.838 --> 01:04:55.839]  How much are you going to be able to get after Codex Alimentarius is in place?
[01:04:56.279 --> 01:04:56.719]  Zero.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:07.183]  I know, I appreciate your call, and the public just doesn't... Listen, they're already having SWAT team raids on aloe vera facilities, saying it now can get you high.
[01:05:08.965 --> 01:05:12.628]  And in Europe, some areas of Europe, they're pushing to have raids on it.
[01:05:14.509 --> 01:05:19.852]  Again, the main thing the establishment has over us is the over-the-topness of this.
[01:05:20.793 --> 01:05:24.996]  And that I understand, as normal people who are awake, you don't want to be around this.
[01:05:25.016 --> 01:05:26.077]  You don't want to focus on it.
[01:05:26.117 --> 01:05:29.559]  You want to just stay to yourself, try to raise your kids right.
[01:05:30.279 --> 01:05:30.980]  You can't do that.
[01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:35.283]  And I understand how you want to pull your head down and not fight the tyranny.
[01:05:37.216 --> 01:05:38.537]  Because I do it sometimes.
[01:05:38.677 --> 01:05:39.538]  I catch myself.
[01:05:40.919 --> 01:05:45.222]  Like I said, Saturday morning, I'd just been fighting tyranny for three days in Hardin, Montana.
[01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:50.866]  I went downstairs at like 7 a.m., 7.30, to get Starbucks coffee down the street.
[01:05:51.587 --> 01:05:57.131]  I'm coming back up the elevator, it opens on the third floor, and there's Girl Scouts milling around with police.
[01:05:57.171 --> 01:05:58.132]  So I step out,
[01:05:59.198 --> 01:06:05.983]  And there's a Homeland Security banner and cops like it was the airport looking at everybody and all a bunch of paranoid power-tripping people.
[01:06:06.924 --> 01:06:09.366]  And I literally didn't panic.
[01:06:09.526 --> 01:06:10.867]  I repulsed from it.
[01:06:11.148 --> 01:06:16.872]  I, like a turtle going in my shell, I was hitting buttons and getting back on.
[01:06:16.892 --> 01:06:22.477]  And I keep telling that story because then as we're walking out of the hotel 30 minutes later to go catch our flight,
[01:06:23.362 --> 01:06:27.645]  I said, by the way, I didn't tell you guys, on the third floor there's a Homeland Security Convention with Girl Scouts.
[01:06:28.005 --> 01:06:29.546]  The entire third floor is full of them.
[01:06:29.566 --> 01:06:31.667]  There's some kind of Homeland Security meeting.
[01:06:32.568 --> 01:06:40.273]  And we know from the news that their new badge from Homeland Security is to spy on their neighbors, fight terror, put out the good word of Homeland Security.
[01:06:40.313 --> 01:06:40.973]  These are quotes.
[01:06:41.654 --> 01:06:42.414]  3.4 million.
[01:06:43.475 --> 01:06:45.796]  And Aaron's like, grabbing by the arm, he goes, let's go!
[01:06:45.856 --> 01:06:48.918]  And I said, no, we got an hour and a half to get to the airport.
[01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:50.039]  Our plane's in an hour and a half.
[01:06:51.519 --> 01:07:00.504]  And thank God, we were in the checkpoint for 30 minutes with them searching us and going over every tape and bugging their eyes out, just Nazi little pig-nosed bastards.
[01:07:00.564 --> 01:07:02.985]  I mean, they would gut you in a minute.
[01:07:03.005 --> 01:07:05.026]  They'd hang you up by your heels in a minute.
[01:07:05.307 --> 01:07:11.710]  I mean, they were crazed women, stalking and asking old ladies, and like a woman, you've got mascara, that's illegal.
[01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:13.151]  Which, by the way, even under their rules, it's not.
[01:07:13.171 --> 01:07:15.412]  And the woman, I'm so sorry, please don't arrest me!
[01:07:15.672 --> 01:07:16.613]  And evil women going...
[01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:19.735]  Just feeding off of it.
[01:07:19.775 --> 01:07:21.916]  I was like, I mean, folks, I can't handle it.
[01:07:22.156 --> 01:07:25.158]  Elevator doors open and there's Homeland Security with little kids.
[01:07:25.198 --> 01:07:28.340]  And then I got to go to the airport and deal with weird pig women.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.922]  And I mean, you know, they look, I mean, folks, I can't handle it.
[01:07:31.402 --> 01:07:32.963]  I mean, these women's eyes, I can't even do it.
[01:07:32.983 --> 01:07:33.203]  We're like.
[01:07:34.744 --> 01:07:36.905]  And I was looking at this woman staring at me in line.
[01:07:38.206 --> 01:07:43.790]  And I started staring back at her and she kind of got excited and came over by the side was looking at me about two feet away and I was just like.
[01:07:45.805 --> 01:07:46.186]  I'm just going to
[01:08:06.489 --> 01:08:07.330]  Oh, look, Lindbergh!
[01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:15.174]  And they singled us out, went over, pulled out a tiny lotion, just went, oh my God, you could be arrested for this.
[01:08:15.214 --> 01:08:17.375]  And they were just, and I just looked at them pathetically.
[01:08:17.435 --> 01:08:22.678]  I mean, literally, this one woman went, you're not allowed to have this.
[01:08:22.738 --> 01:08:25.560]  I mean, they're just like ready to come in your houses and grab your kids.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.803]  They're just waiting to jump on the American people.
[01:08:31.596 --> 01:08:37.839]  Well, one would have to be willingly blind to not be able to look around and realize we're right in the middle of the Book of Revelations.
[01:08:51.536 --> 01:08:55.918]  Listen, listen, it's like, it's like termites, where you rip aside the wall and there's nothing but termites.
[01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.160]  I mean, that's just tyranny everywhere, dude.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.182]  Hotel doors randomly open and I'm in Homeland Security with the kids.
[01:09:02.242 --> 01:09:06.544]  I mean, they're everywhere, breeding around us, building up for their attack on us.
[01:09:07.044 --> 01:09:07.885]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:09:08.565 --> 01:09:11.507]  They're so attracted to you because you carry the light, my friend.
[01:09:12.384 --> 01:09:15.927]  I mean, you are a light in the pit of darkness, and it intimidates them.
[01:09:15.967 --> 01:09:18.809]  That's why... Well, they were harassing, like, a 90-year-old woman in a wheelchair, too.
[01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:20.391]  They're attracted by herd animals.
[01:09:20.791 --> 01:09:21.672]  It's a predator thing.
[01:09:21.912 --> 01:09:27.817]  They see somebody and... No, it's... I'm sorry.
[01:09:27.837 --> 01:09:28.237]  Go ahead.
[01:09:28.578 --> 01:09:31.120]  It's like a pack of wolves on an innocent lamb.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.283]  But you never cease to amaze me how much information you know, man.
[01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:36.965]  And this is why I'm calling you.
[01:09:37.825 --> 01:09:38.606]  I'm in the military.
[01:09:39.318 --> 01:09:42.281]  And I am NOT going to take the vaccination.
[01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:43.362]  That's where I need your help.
[01:09:44.282 --> 01:09:45.644]  What can I quote them?
[01:09:46.104 --> 01:09:53.410]  What kind of articles can I print out and take to them to back up when I tell them that it's full of squalene and all that other crap?
[01:09:54.131 --> 01:09:55.072]  But I'm not going to take it.
[01:09:55.472 --> 01:09:59.295]  Because if it comes down to it, if they tell me it's mandatory and I have to, I'm going to go to the commander and get out.
[01:09:59.596 --> 01:10:00.176]  I'm not doing it.
[01:10:00.757 --> 01:10:01.397]  Not going to happen.
[01:10:01.457 --> 01:10:02.298]  But that's where I need your help.
[01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:04.931]  What can I quote to you?
[01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.892]  Just like public schools, it's a policy.
[01:10:08.312 --> 01:10:22.078]  They tried to force anthrax and smallpox shots on the troops, and because the medical corps and the army and air force said no every time because of all the deaths, they saw the deaths happening, it got suspended, but not before the carnage.
[01:10:23.138 --> 01:10:27.880]  So the main thing is they can't force you in the military to take an experimental vaccine.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.101]  This vaccine was never properly approved.
[01:10:31.141 --> 01:10:32.062]  In fact, that's in my
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.781]  I'm going to get to that later in the flu section.
[01:10:36.341 --> 01:10:39.082]  So it's never been properly tested or approved.
[01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:41.163]  They can't make you take an experimental.
[01:10:41.663 --> 01:10:44.504]  They admit it has squalene and a bunch of articles you can pull up.
[01:10:46.064 --> 01:10:49.065]  And you can also say, well, the commander-in-chief says I don't have to take it.
[01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:54.987]  And you can show them the nursing group suing, saying it's dangerous, not wanting to take it.
[01:10:55.787 --> 01:10:56.127]  Stay there.
[01:10:56.147 --> 01:10:57.428]  I'll come back to you after this break.
[01:11:00.931 --> 01:11:02.453]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.075]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:11:04.376 --> 01:11:11.805]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:11:12.206 --> 01:11:15.049]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:18.714]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:11:19.289 --> 01:11:31.280]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system, which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.822]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:11:33.842 --> 01:11:35.143]  I use one every day.
[01:11:35.584 --> 01:11:37.986]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:11:38.266 --> 01:11:38.826]  We're good.
[01:12:01.007 --> 01:12:07.372]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:12:07.752 --> 01:12:09.734]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:12:10.395 --> 01:12:11.415]  But who is the enemy?
[01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:12.456]  Bin Laden.
[01:12:12.756 --> 01:12:13.657]  This is his ammo.
[01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:15.098]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:12:15.118 --> 01:12:16.780]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:23.865]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:12:24.266 --> 01:12:24.686]  Some U.S.
[01:12:24.746 --> 01:12:30.391]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:12:31.071 --> 01:12:34.554]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:12:34.574 --> 01:12:37.616]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:13:00.825 --> 01:13:07.050]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:13:07.511 --> 01:13:15.278]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:13:15.618 --> 01:13:23.505]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:13:23.785 --> 01:13:28.549]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:13:28.869 --> 01:13:33.573]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:13:34.093 --> 01:13:37.936]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:13:38.436 --> 01:13:39.457]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:13:39.537 --> 01:13:43.560]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:48.405]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:13:48.926 --> 01:13:51.488]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:13:51.929 --> 01:13:53.691]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:53.711 --> 01:13:53.951]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:54.011 --> 01:13:57.195]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:07.691]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:11.371]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[01:14:11.811 --> 01:14:18.193]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[01:14:18.513 --> 01:14:22.054]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[01:14:22.394 --> 01:14:26.395]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[01:14:26.755 --> 01:14:30.056]  Nutroversal Foods from eFoods Direct, your new comfort food.
[01:14:30.356 --> 01:14:31.596]  Incredible taste, easy
[01:14:35.998 --> 01:14:36.859]  We're good to go!
[01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:08.513]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[01:15:09.014 --> 01:15:10.317]  It's a problem in the USA!
[01:15:13.346 --> 01:15:14.707]  This is CNN, folks.
[01:15:14.747 --> 01:15:16.429]  This is the type of stuff on TV.
[01:15:16.949 --> 01:15:24.035]  They were literally just worshipping Obama, saying our country will go bankrupt if we don't have the people run healthcare through the government.
[01:15:24.876 --> 01:15:33.943]  And then they were singing some song about the flu vaccine and how great it is and saying, yes, we can, in little military uniforms, worshipping Obama on CNN.
[01:15:34.003 --> 01:15:34.804]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[01:15:34.844 --> 01:15:36.505]  This country's gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:37.126 --> 01:15:38.327]  I mean, I mean.
[01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:45.021]  And they bring these poor kids up there to push government takeover of health care.
[01:15:47.201 --> 01:15:48.382]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:15:49.222 --> 01:15:50.462]  Turn up this nightmare again.
[01:15:55.304 --> 01:16:01.246]  I wonder if they'll sing, Obama loves all the little children, red, yellow, black and white, they're all equal in the president's side.
[01:16:01.286 --> 01:16:03.727]  I mean, they're already teaching in public school, he's Jesus.
[01:16:05.759 --> 01:16:06.880]  Let me give people a little tip.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.844]  You're not in a free country when they're changing Christian hymns over to the President.
[01:16:11.264 --> 01:16:12.625]  I want to give everybody a little tip there.
[01:16:14.047 --> 01:16:17.210]  By the way, they have announced they're handing over internet control to the U.N.
[01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:19.251]  And it's being hailed as, oh, the U.S.
[01:16:19.291 --> 01:16:20.372]  doesn't control it anymore.
[01:16:20.453 --> 01:16:20.653]  No.
[01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:24.997]  The private ICANN corporation can now do whatever it wants with internet, too.
[01:16:25.097 --> 01:16:26.218]  So that's coming up.
[01:16:27.139 --> 01:16:27.979]  Look at this article.
[01:16:30.868 --> 01:16:36.515]  About 10 years ago, seeing the New York Times saying, in the future, the new economy will be nothing but prisons.
[01:16:36.555 --> 01:16:43.062]  But how good that is, and how they're going to pay citizen volunteers $1,000 a month.
[01:16:43.703 --> 01:16:44.444]  Welfare people.
[01:16:44.604 --> 01:16:45.826]  You want your money, you gotta do this.
[01:16:46.126 --> 01:16:50.832]  With a computer in their house that watches CCTV cameras in another city.
[01:16:52.093 --> 01:17:05.225]  And that you've got to flag crimes, and that fake crimes would be superimposed, that DARPA was developing this, fake crimes would be superimposed over the video feed to make sure you were reporting or you'd lose your welfare.
[01:17:05.906 --> 01:17:10.030]  So they're now taking arm, and here it is in the register, this is in England, but same thing here.
[01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:16.136]  Watson was telling me in the town he lives, it's on their cable system, where you can go spy on your neighbors, on the other side of town.
[01:17:17.105 --> 01:17:20.688]  Local CCTVs on the cable system, and they ask you to spy.
[01:17:21.029 --> 01:17:25.172]  And now they're recruiting the Homeland Security, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts.
[01:17:25.593 --> 01:17:27.395]  I mean, folks, here it is!
[01:17:27.755 --> 01:17:34.621]  New web service aims to recruit tens of thousands of unpaid watchmen to monitor neglected CCTV cameras nationwide.
[01:17:35.042 --> 01:17:39.245]  InternetEyes.co.uk, a startup based in...
[01:17:40.046 --> 01:17:50.180]  Startford, upon Avon, plans to charge businesses $20, £20 per month for members of its website to watch live feeds and report incidents via text message.
[01:17:50.781 --> 01:17:54.246]  In return, members will be entered into a crime-fighting league.
[01:17:54.426 --> 01:17:55.107]  A league!
[01:17:55.828 --> 01:17:58.329]  Receiving points for each genuine incident reported.
[01:17:58.689 --> 01:18:02.731]  At the end of each month, the top scorer will receive $1,000 cash reward.
[01:18:03.372 --> 01:18:04.152]  It's not a game.
[01:18:04.192 --> 01:18:05.733]  We're fighting crime and terrorism.
[01:18:05.773 --> 01:18:08.534]  See, first it was terror, now it's crime and terror.
[01:18:09.215 --> 01:18:10.855]  I'm gonna shut up and go back to the callers.
[01:18:11.836 --> 01:18:13.797]  Dan in New Mexico, you were asking...
[01:18:15.126 --> 01:18:17.268]  How do you get the military to not forcibly inject you?
[01:18:17.308 --> 01:18:17.849]  Here's the deal.
[01:18:18.449 --> 01:18:22.914]  You hold out long enough until enough medical corps has refused.
[01:18:22.954 --> 01:18:24.715]  It's already, lawsuits are already filed.
[01:18:25.336 --> 01:18:26.617]  The troops are already fighting.
[01:18:27.318 --> 01:18:30.081]  The physicians in the military are already saying no.
[01:18:31.182 --> 01:18:32.183]  If you can hold out,
[01:18:33.311 --> 01:18:37.937]  And say, well, if you want to be immoral about it, you say, look, I'm not going to make a big stink out of this.
[01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:42.102]  I'm not calling for, you know, you can feed on them.
[01:18:42.503 --> 01:18:43.244]  I'm not taking it.
[01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:45.466]  If you make a big deal out of it, they'll try to court martial you.
[01:18:45.747 --> 01:18:47.129]  If you try to warn other slaves.
[01:18:49.108 --> 01:18:55.653]  The military is a special group for them because that's who they test the chemical and biologicals and radiologicals on.
[01:18:55.753 --> 01:19:00.877]  They march our troops into chambers and nerve gas them routinely, Project Shad and other operations that are declassified.
[01:19:01.297 --> 01:19:10.864]  So they already test biologicals and chemicals and radiologicals on you, so they love that precedent that you're the final testing before the American people.
[01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:13.086]  You're literally like lab rats to them.
[01:19:13.526 --> 01:19:15.208]  Once they ask the top scientist in the
[01:19:15.788 --> 01:19:18.713]  Weapons program, atomic scientists, why are we using troops?
[01:19:19.073 --> 01:19:20.075]  Why don't we use monkeys?
[01:19:20.736 --> 01:19:22.759]  And he said monkeys are a lot cheaper.
[01:19:24.142 --> 01:19:26.385]  I mean humans are a lot cheaper than monkeys.
[01:19:27.239 --> 01:19:31.983]  And so you can bring them the articles admitting it's got squalene.
[01:19:32.344 --> 01:19:35.907]  You can bring them the articles admitting it's experimental and wasn't properly tested.
[01:19:35.927 --> 01:19:37.328]  I'm going to go over some of those later.
[01:19:37.348 --> 01:19:38.429]  I got to go through my stack here.
[01:19:38.449 --> 01:19:46.357]  I mean, you can explain to them the best loophole you've got is under Army regulations or Pentagon regulations.
[01:19:47.358 --> 01:19:52.499]  They can't force you to take an experimental vaccine, and it still is experimental, never fully approved.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.500]  They're doing it under emergency auspices.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:20:01.502]  But, even with the anthrax of smallpox, it took a bunch of deaths before they quit under rebellion.
[01:20:02.022 --> 01:20:08.344]  Now they're coming back with a new group five, six years later, and so I don't know what to tell you.
[01:20:10.244 --> 01:20:12.445]  But does that rant answer your question there, Dan?
[01:20:13.736 --> 01:20:17.100]  Yeah, for the most part, I think I'm armed with the information that I need to know now.
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.503]  And I do appreciate that, and I thank you.
[01:20:21.244 --> 01:20:25.988]  One thing about PrisonPlan.TV, I have a problem with TerrorStorm.
[01:20:26.048 --> 01:20:30.533]  Will you pardon up TerrorStorm and follow the Republic for me on a special deal?
[01:20:31.794 --> 01:20:32.575]  I'm confused.
[01:20:32.635 --> 01:20:33.275]  What are you saying?
[01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:34.757]  You're saying it won't play for you?
[01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:35.718]  Right.
[01:20:35.758 --> 01:20:37.900]  When I download the .movie file, it won't play.
[01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:41.011]  I'll have the guys look into it.
[01:20:41.792 --> 01:20:43.613]  Sometime in five years it should be fixed.
[01:20:43.653 --> 01:20:44.133]  I'm joking.
[01:20:45.074 --> 01:20:47.575]  We're in the process of re-uploading everything too.
[01:20:48.656 --> 01:20:49.877]  Give us your email right now.
[01:20:50.437 --> 01:20:51.398]  And we'll just send you an email.
[01:20:51.418 --> 01:20:52.238]  We're on the march.
[01:20:52.739 --> 01:20:54.340]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:57.942]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:00.776 --> 01:21:04.757]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:21:05.017 --> 01:21:06.797]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:21:07.017 --> 01:21:15.279]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:21:15.539 --> 01:21:20.741]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:21:21.081 --> 01:21:22.701]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:21:22.941 --> 01:21:29.263]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:21:29.463 --> 01:21:40.205]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:21:40.505 --> 01:21:41.005]  That's right.
[01:21:41.266 --> 01:21:43.586]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:21:43.846 --> 01:21:45.407]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[01:21:47.988 --> 01:22:05.923]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:22:06.063 --> 01:22:10.427]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:22:10.587 --> 01:22:12.448]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:22:12.869 --> 01:22:14.210]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:15.531]  There is a solution.
[01:22:15.751 --> 01:22:23.777]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:24:08.664 --> 01:24:08.924]  I think?
[01:24:37.168 --> 01:24:40.889]  I told myself that I was going to be calm and relaxed when I got back to Austin.
[01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:48.350]  But, uh, because I am really sick of the New World Order.
[01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:52.671]  I can't explain to you how sick of the New World Order I am.
[01:24:54.072 --> 01:24:59.633]  I'm tired of nobodies that get positions of power and government rank, urinating all over everybody.
[01:24:59.653 --> 01:25:04.534]  Yeah, one in 91 in the United States now have autism.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.101]  And that's not just over-reporting.
[01:25:08.062 --> 01:25:10.044]  You walk around and look at kids on the streets.
[01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:11.225]  You try to go to a movie.
[01:25:11.785 --> 01:25:13.507]  I tell you, I try to take my kids every once in a while.
[01:25:13.527 --> 01:25:14.308]  I took them to see Up.
[01:25:15.028 --> 01:25:17.831]  Front two rows were autistic.
[01:25:18.131 --> 01:25:19.412]  Just howling and screaming.
[01:25:19.852 --> 01:25:21.073]  I felt so sorry for them.
[01:25:21.634 --> 01:25:23.636]  You know, they'd see a part they liked and get excited.
[01:25:25.782 --> 01:25:27.422]  You didn't see that when I was a kid, no.
[01:25:27.542 --> 01:25:31.363]  These people, like seeing it this morning, was going, what's going on?
[01:25:32.363 --> 01:25:33.764]  Is it something in the water?
[01:25:33.784 --> 01:25:36.044]  Is it something in the food?
[01:25:36.104 --> 01:25:38.225]  Is it something... Hell yes it is, lady!
[01:25:40.305 --> 01:25:43.046]  Half of corn syrup products have high levels of mercury.
[01:25:43.626 --> 01:25:45.586]  That'll completely brain damage a kid.
[01:25:46.166 --> 01:25:49.827]  They put extra fluoride in bottled water just for babies?
[01:25:51.325 --> 01:25:55.467]  They know sodium fluoride retards the growth massively in children.
[01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:59.249]  They know it increases bone cancer, dental fluorosis.
[01:25:59.509 --> 01:26:01.610]  This is all admitted!
[01:26:03.571 --> 01:26:08.433]  One of the scientists that helped develop the Gardasil shot is now saying, don't give it to children, it'll kill you.
[01:26:10.414 --> 01:26:11.075]  Do they care?
[01:26:11.415 --> 01:26:11.715]  No!
[01:26:11.735 --> 01:26:19.979]  I mean, you go to the shopping mall now, and it looks like the public's been hit with a mutation ray.
[01:26:23.902 --> 01:26:37.857]  But they'll just make, on CNN and all the other channels, they'll make a big thing out of it and, you know, a big community thing and have local groups and we'll fund big medical firms to find out what did it, when they're the ones that did it with the mercury in the shots more than anything.
[01:26:39.352 --> 01:26:43.073]  It's like, gee, I pumped my baby at birth with nine different shots.
[01:26:43.093 --> 01:26:44.434]  I mean, think about that.
[01:26:44.494 --> 01:26:53.116]  Huge injectors filled with liquid, full of RNA, DNA from the animals they grew it on, the tissue, just pumping mercury into them.
[01:26:53.356 --> 01:26:57.478]  And then the babies, I mean, babies routinely, and then they're like, can't even nurse.
[01:26:57.518 --> 01:26:58.978]  Everybody talks about it at the hospitals.
[01:26:58.998 --> 01:27:06.080]  They give them the shot, kid's like, gee, I wonder why my 18-month-old was so happy until it got its third round of shots.
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.261]  Kid's like, mommy, daddy, next thing.
[01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:11.398]  You know.
[01:27:11.699 --> 01:27:12.840]  Gee, I wonder what happened.
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:14.882]  The other kid's like having a convulsion in the car home.
[01:27:15.851 --> 01:27:18.892]  You take the kid back to the hospital, they're gonna CPS him and say they shook him.
[01:27:19.072 --> 01:27:21.433]  They're gonna CAT scan and go, look, brain inflammation!
[01:27:21.673 --> 01:27:22.853]  You beat your child!
[01:27:23.434 --> 01:27:24.534]  You're like, no, no I didn't.
[01:27:24.554 --> 01:27:25.314]  The cops are there.
[01:27:26.655 --> 01:27:27.795]  We got somebody for the grid.
[01:27:27.815 --> 01:27:29.596]  We gotta fill these big-ass prisons everywhere.
[01:27:30.256 --> 01:27:32.577]  You're like, but my kid had a convulsion after the shot.
[01:27:32.717 --> 01:27:33.257]  Shut up!
[01:27:34.978 --> 01:27:35.938]  Give me a billy club!
[01:27:37.639 --> 01:27:39.379]  It isn't enough we brain damaged your kid.
[01:27:39.579 --> 01:27:40.880]  Now we're gonna have more!
[01:27:43.188 --> 01:27:43.849]  We rule!
[01:27:43.869 --> 01:27:46.091]  Eugenics, we're poisoning your water!
[01:27:46.331 --> 01:27:47.833]  Hell yeah!
[01:27:48.113 --> 01:27:49.734]  Hell yeah, it's fun!
[01:27:59.644 --> 01:28:03.187]  I mean, it's freaking me out, folks, to sit and watch them having their way with us.
[01:28:03.207 --> 01:28:04.869]  All right, let's go back to calls, as I promised.
[01:28:10.623 --> 01:28:13.165]  Gary in Ohio, then Andrew Summer, Brian Catherine.
[01:28:13.185 --> 01:28:13.866]  Go ahead, Gary.
[01:28:14.587 --> 01:28:16.308]  Yeah, Alex, good to hear from you.
[01:28:16.889 --> 01:28:18.290]  I've got a couple things I'd like to bring up.
[01:28:19.191 --> 01:28:26.537]  We have a Continental Congress coming up of people trying to straighten out the Constitution and get us right back to it and such.
[01:28:27.398 --> 01:28:37.767]  The vote is this weekend, the 10th actually, and if people can Google it up and look at the people that they have a possibility of voting for in their area,
[01:28:38.311 --> 01:28:47.114]  The whole country's supposed to have the vote this weekend, and we'll see if we can start straightening some of this out from bringing a government that the people have back up.
[01:28:48.155 --> 01:28:53.016]  Also, I'd like to discuss the Civilian National Security Force for just a second.
[01:28:53.617 --> 01:28:55.157]  Isn't that already the militia?
[01:28:55.577 --> 01:28:57.078]  We just got to reactivate that one?
[01:28:58.458 --> 01:29:00.219]  Yeah, do me a favor and turn your radio off.
[01:29:00.799 --> 01:29:01.219]  Okay.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.821]  It's really rough to hear what you're saying with that going in the background.
[01:29:07.338 --> 01:29:10.440]  Yes, everything government does is to create an evil counterfeit.
[01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:26.112]  And so they're saying we're going to have a national security force of environmental spies, anti-terror spies, CPS spies, everything's illegal, garage sales, keeping your neighbor's kids, everything's evil, having a Bible meeting, everything's evil, but evil.
[01:29:26.232 --> 01:29:27.393]  Evil is good and protected.
[01:29:28.534 --> 01:29:36.240]  And they lie and say that gun ownership's only for the National Guard, the militia, but the National Guard didn't exist until
[01:29:38.145 --> 01:29:39.766]  1906, was it officially chartered or 1904?
[01:29:39.826 --> 01:29:41.186]  I forget, but 19-something.
[01:29:42.247 --> 01:29:45.969]  And, no, it's every able-bodied man 18 to 54.
[01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:48.311]  And that's what it is.
[01:29:48.331 --> 01:29:54.155]  So that's why they demonize that, which is supposed to be your local constabulary, your local men.
[01:29:54.195 --> 01:29:57.157]  You can't have men protecting, only government.
[01:29:58.657 --> 01:30:02.680]  You can't have a citizen who doesn't, who hadn't paid tax money who protects the community.
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.602]  You gotta have somebody that can arrest some people, steal some property.
[01:30:06.661 --> 01:30:07.604]  And so that's what's going on.
[01:30:07.644 --> 01:30:08.487]  I appreciate your call.
[01:30:08.628 --> 01:30:09.611]  Andrew in D.C.
[01:30:10.112 --> 01:30:11.035]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[01:30:11.055 --> 01:30:12.660]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:30:13.612 --> 01:30:14.953]  Pretty upset about things.
[01:30:15.694 --> 01:30:15.834]  Yes.
[01:30:15.854 --> 01:30:17.375]  Because I'm wondering what comes next.
[01:30:17.775 --> 01:30:18.676]  I know what comes next.
[01:30:19.016 --> 01:30:37.389]  More staged terror attacks, total depression, hordes of people worshipping government, kids with armbands on street corners with TV ads about how they're heroes and we'll have to worship the Ugan or we're anti-American and lots of drunks stumbling around going, look at my son Junior!
[01:30:37.609 --> 01:30:39.751]  He's a member of the Homeland Brigade!
[01:30:40.191 --> 01:30:42.452]  I had a quick comment about a news story I just read on the Huffington Post.
[01:30:42.492 --> 01:30:47.255]  I'm not sure if you've heard of this yet, but apparently the FBI just arrested a New Yorker for
[01:31:08.889 --> 01:31:11.291]  Using Twitter to direct the movement.
[01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:12.372]  Yeah.
[01:31:12.572 --> 01:31:14.153]  Lone Guardian is reporting on this.
[01:31:14.253 --> 01:31:17.816]  New York man accused of using Twitter to direct protests during G20.
[01:31:18.377 --> 01:31:21.419]  And they said that, see the police would surround the groups.
[01:31:21.439 --> 01:31:22.900]  This happened to Rob Doo and say leave.
[01:31:23.021 --> 01:31:25.422]  And then when you tried to leave, they wouldn't let you leave.
[01:31:25.783 --> 01:31:28.685]  And so he was directing them saying here's a spot to get out.
[01:31:28.985 --> 01:31:30.607]  So they're charging him as a terrorist.
[01:31:30.647 --> 01:31:34.490]  Yes, you're not allowed to, you're not allowed to tell people how to follow police orders.
[01:31:35.242 --> 01:31:42.325]  Right, and then, I just can't get over how nonchalantly in the article they just state that it's his political writings, even.
[01:31:44.026 --> 01:31:49.088]  Yeah, they say that's illegal, that he showed he has political ideas and writings, and protest is illegal.
[01:31:49.408 --> 01:31:51.529]  Having political writings is basically illegal.
[01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:53.750]  They're handing the U.S.
[01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:57.332]  Internet that we built completely over to a private consortium.
[01:31:57.352 --> 01:31:58.872]  That happened on Monday.
[01:31:58.892 --> 01:32:01.353]  And we've just entered a vortex.
[01:32:02.594 --> 01:32:04.695]  And I just had one other quick question.
[01:32:05.906 --> 01:32:08.849]  I know you talked about earlier how you've been to D.C.
[01:32:08.869 --> 01:32:09.529]  a few times.
[01:32:10.110 --> 01:32:19.578]  I was wondering if you've ever traveled to Baltimore, Maryland and seen any of the police state measures they've started there under the name of the War on Drugs.
[01:32:20.198 --> 01:32:24.542]  Yes, they have armored vehicles, checkpoints, searching people randomly.
[01:32:25.183 --> 01:32:28.265]  They're taking blood in Maryland at checkpoints without warrants.
[01:32:28.285 --> 01:32:30.968]  It's just hellish tyranny, and they love it.
[01:32:32.068 --> 01:32:34.710]  And the cops enjoy the fact that you don't like them.
[01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:42.615]  They enjoy the fact, you know, I read about a guy that tried to kill on death row for two hours trying to find a vein.
[01:32:43.015 --> 01:32:47.178]  Well, the cops, it's reported, just fishing needles into people in Arizona.
[01:32:47.739 --> 01:32:58.826]  I mean, they'll just sit and they'll get mad and just, just like, just be, you know, just like niggling it around all in there, just gruggling it around, just like, you're just screaming.
[01:32:59.166 --> 01:33:01.388]  If you don't like it, they'll, ah, Billy Club.
[01:33:02.268 --> 01:33:06.291]  I got this job because I'm a sadomasochist!
[01:33:06.331 --> 01:33:11.774]  Yeah, and that's the new system, just grabbing the slaves, injecting hell force!
[01:33:15.196 --> 01:33:25.003]  And on top of that, I don't know if you've heard of Baltimore's BELIEVE program, which is total propaganda to begin with, but they've actually installed these
[01:33:26.427 --> 01:33:27.887]  They call them blue light cameras.
[01:33:27.907 --> 01:33:32.508]  They're on the corners in the especially poor neighborhoods.
[01:33:33.628 --> 01:33:48.611]  And they have the Baltimore Police emblem on them and they say believe under them and the police officers in the Baltimore Police Department can access them from their police cars and zoom in even down the block into someone's car to watch what they're doing.
[01:33:48.831 --> 01:33:54.472]  Oh no, and they also are putting, I read in DC and New York and Baltimore, what England's had for five years,
[01:33:56.141 --> 01:33:57.802]  Cameras that bark orders at you.
[01:33:58.342 --> 01:33:59.103]  Telescreens.
[01:33:59.503 --> 01:34:03.205]  And some of them even have a face where it makes a mean face like, stop that!
[01:34:03.225 --> 01:34:05.046]  It's like, you know, a computer TV screen.
[01:34:05.646 --> 01:34:08.027]  Oh yeah, hey listen, and don't worry, cops you're winning.
[01:34:08.067 --> 01:34:09.048]  Take all the shots.
[01:34:09.328 --> 01:34:10.408]  Drink the tap water.
[01:34:10.468 --> 01:34:11.369]  Worship government.
[01:34:11.569 --> 01:34:13.490]  You're gonna end up just like the German forces.
[01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:15.491]  You're just gonna love what you get.
[01:34:15.551 --> 01:34:17.592]  Don't worry, you end up losing in the end.
[01:34:17.992 --> 01:34:18.993]  I appreciate your call.
[01:34:19.813 --> 01:34:21.054]  Evil Andrew from D.C.
[01:34:21.114 --> 01:34:21.855]  He knows how to talk.
[01:34:21.895 --> 01:34:23.276]  That's the sound of Al Qaeda support.
[01:34:23.836 --> 01:34:24.977]  Summer in Indiana.
[01:34:25.017 --> 01:34:26.057]  Summer, you're on the air.
[01:34:26.077 --> 01:34:27.418]  Hello, Alex.
[01:34:27.498 --> 01:34:28.099]  How are you?
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.781]  Pretty sick of it all.
[01:34:31.301 --> 01:34:31.942]  Me too.
[01:34:31.962 --> 01:34:36.605]  I just want to let you know we went ahead and pre-ordered The Fall of the Republic.
[01:34:37.065 --> 01:34:39.507]  Got the Obama Deception and Endgame as well.
[01:34:40.267 --> 01:34:43.189]  I have a stack of 100 DVDs and a brand new burner.
[01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:44.770]  Getting ready to go off.
[01:34:44.871 --> 01:34:47.993]  Well, that's what I wanted to ask listeners to do, is to commit
[01:34:49.076 --> 01:34:53.699]  To fighting these tyrants, because now that they're really showing us who they are, everybody's waking up.
[01:34:53.919 --> 01:34:56.041]  And they're trying to intimidate us into submitting.
[01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:56.862]  It's not going to work.
[01:34:57.202 --> 01:35:01.105]  We're going to throw this off, throw this coil off, throw this yoke off.
[01:35:01.785 --> 01:35:12.012]  And I just want everybody to get the DVD burners locked and loaded, and to hit the New World Order hard with Follow the Republic, because we're going to show people who the criminals are, who the enemy is.
[01:35:12.052 --> 01:35:12.433]  Go ahead.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:19.764]  Well, I just wonder if you were in Terre Haute, Indiana for Timothy McVeigh's execution?
[01:35:20.364 --> 01:35:21.545]  No, I wasn't there for that.
[01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:28.209]  Alright, well, I was just curious, because if you were, I wanted to ask you how close you were to the VX gas.
[01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:36.574]  We have our nation's supply of VX gas here in Indiana, about 15 miles away from my home.
[01:35:38.423 --> 01:35:44.324]  And, uh, they're telling us all that, you know, it was supposed to be destroyed by 2012, but it's already gone.
[01:35:45.184 --> 01:35:49.985]  And, uh, just to get your take on it, you know, and, because I'm kind of freaked out about it.
[01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:53.946]  Well, they do have nerve gas at centers all over the country.
[01:35:54.366 --> 01:35:56.826]  One of the places they use to get rid of it is Anniston, Alabama.
[01:35:57.546 --> 01:35:59.527]  And that is a smokestack you want to worry about.
[01:36:00.067 --> 01:36:03.447]  They burn VX gas and other forms of nerve gas around the country.
[01:36:03.967 --> 01:36:05.027]  Good to hear from you, Summer.
[01:36:05.388 --> 01:36:06.988]  Brian in Montreal, Canada.
[01:36:07.008 --> 01:36:07.848]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:36:08.444 --> 01:36:11.045]  Hi Alex, I'd just like to mention two things.
[01:36:11.125 --> 01:36:13.426]  The first is a news you could say.
[01:36:13.946 --> 01:36:19.689]  Up here in Quebec, we have private clinics that are free, that are controlled and run by the government.
[01:36:19.749 --> 01:36:21.129]  They're called CLSCs.
[01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:31.354]  Well, I have the internal document that they received last month telling all of their health care workers that yes, they will be forced to take the inoculation shot.
[01:36:32.114 --> 01:36:36.396]  They have to consider the public's risk over their own personal preferences.
[01:36:37.233 --> 01:36:39.178]  So this is happening up here in Quebec, too.
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:40.982]  Yeah, it's global.
[01:36:41.163 --> 01:36:44.632]  I mean, this is all directed by the UN publicly under the World Health Organization.
[01:36:45.173 --> 01:36:46.476]  And here's the issue.
[01:36:47.833 --> 01:37:15.663]  And I already knew this, but to see them admit it on Fox News like it was a good thing, they said, oh, people really want it, but there's only limited supplies of 200,000 dosages going to Indiana and going to Texas and going to New York for nurses and medical workers and police, and it's a nasal spray of live flu virus, and yes, it can spread the flu, and yes, it can hurt you if you have an autoimmune problem,
[01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:17.283]  But that's okay.
[01:37:17.323 --> 01:37:27.446]  So they're literally going to spread the H1N1 with a live nasal shot, a spray, and then everybody's going to panic when suddenly it's spreading.
[01:37:28.246 --> 01:37:32.007]  Just they do it in plain view because the public doesn't know what day it is.
[01:37:32.407 --> 01:37:33.048]  They don't know.
[01:37:33.068 --> 01:37:37.769]  It's mind-blowing.
[01:37:38.809 --> 01:37:41.430]  It is mind-blowing to see all this going on.
[01:37:42.017 --> 01:37:55.760]  If it's alright with you, Alex, I'd just also like to mention that on the site that I'm on most of the time, 12-160, I have a Chemtrail reporting page, and I have the 1975 weather modification treaty between Canada and the U.S.
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.520]  up on it.
[01:37:56.981 --> 01:38:03.242]  So for any of the clowns out there that actually believe that they're responsible for polluting, and that we should be paying a carbon tax,
[01:38:03.834 --> 01:38:11.219]  You might want to go and read that treaty and a few of the patents that I put up to see what they've been spraying over your head for the last... I hear ya, and they now admit they've been doing it.
[01:38:11.239 --> 01:38:12.320]  It's now declassified.
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:13.861]  They're not even denying it now.
[01:38:14.661 --> 01:38:19.185]  The White House sides are publicly giving speeches about how they're chemtrailing you and how great it is.
[01:38:19.605 --> 01:38:26.870]  Now... Let's just continue with phone calls, as promised.
[01:38:30.609 --> 01:38:32.790]  Let's go ahead and talk to Catherine in Missouri.
[01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:33.751]  Catherine, you're on the air.
[01:38:33.791 --> 01:38:34.251]  Go ahead.
[01:38:35.152 --> 01:38:35.852]  Hi, Alex.
[01:38:35.892 --> 01:38:38.714]  This is Catherine Bleich from the documentary Camp FEMA.
[01:38:39.335 --> 01:38:39.695]  Hey!
[01:38:39.735 --> 01:38:40.255]  How you doing?
[01:38:40.936 --> 01:38:41.636]  Good!
[01:38:41.696 --> 01:38:44.218]  I wanted to make sure you knew how to pronounce my name.
[01:38:44.238 --> 01:38:45.338]  You said it wrong a couple times.
[01:38:45.438 --> 01:38:46.079]  It's Bleich.
[01:38:46.179 --> 01:38:46.959]  Long I, like James.
[01:38:46.979 --> 01:38:48.620]  Well, you know, that's my specialty, ma'am.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.961]  My specialty.
[01:38:50.362 --> 01:38:57.046]  Well, I wanted to let you know, I know you're pretty frustrated right now, and I know a lot of us are, but there are some things to be hopeful about.
[01:38:57.850 --> 01:39:04.233]  I feel really blessed to be here in the state of Missouri right now, because we have state reps who are waking up right before our eyes.
[01:39:04.653 --> 01:39:06.895]  And it's the most beautiful thing I've ever been a witness to.
[01:39:06.975 --> 01:39:11.697]  I've been to all four of the MIAC hearings, and we are headed in a very positive direction.
[01:39:11.757 --> 01:39:27.265]  I know that Bob Dixon, the chairman of the committee, was quoted saying, you know, it's unlikely that we will abolish the Fusion Center, but one of the things they're considering is getting the federal government out of the Fusion Center and making it just a state-based thing, which I think
[01:39:27.785 --> 01:39:29.166]  Oh, but yeah, but I mean, look.
[01:39:29.506 --> 01:39:31.986]  Look, the fusion centers were set up by the feds.
[01:39:32.327 --> 01:39:32.967]  They were paid.
[01:39:32.987 --> 01:39:34.567]  They're federalizing everything.
[01:39:34.907 --> 01:39:37.648]  They're putting army liaison in with the police.
[01:39:38.048 --> 01:39:42.410]  They're saying the veterans and gun owners are what Homeland Security's for, which is the truth.
[01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:44.651]  And it just needs to be abolished.
[01:39:45.031 --> 01:39:47.992]  I mean, this whole thing about, what, you want the terrorists to get us?
[01:39:48.252 --> 01:39:50.052]  The terrorists are the government.
[01:39:50.272 --> 01:39:54.734]  They're staging and provocateuring every single terror attack I've ever studied.
[01:39:55.626 --> 01:39:56.527]  But here's the good news.
[01:39:56.607 --> 01:40:00.229]  Our state reps are waking up to the fact that the federal government is the problem.
[01:40:00.529 --> 01:40:02.630]  So I'm happy and excited to report that.
[01:40:03.010 --> 01:40:12.236]  I also wanted to let you know that Camp FEMA will be having its world premiere of public viewing at the Midwest Liberty Fest, which is going to be in Des Moines, Illinois this weekend.
[01:40:12.636 --> 01:40:14.197]  It will actually air on Saturday.
[01:40:14.878 --> 01:40:22.861]  And what's really special about this event, the Midwest Liberty Fest, is that we are bringing together the anti-war movement, the Tea Party movement, the Ron Paulers.
[01:40:23.241 --> 01:40:33.345]  And for the first time, you are going to see an actual event where real grassroots movers and shakers, not just talking heads, but people who have found success doing the things they do, are coming together.
[01:40:33.365 --> 01:40:33.445]  Good.
[01:40:33.505 --> 01:40:34.185]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:40:34.205 --> 01:40:35.326]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[01:40:35.346 --> 01:40:36.706]  You do a good job in that documentary.

[01:40:48.692 --> 01:40:50.373]  We've got four new t-shirts.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.801]  Now in on the shopping cart.
[01:40:52.821 --> 01:40:54.322]  I'm glad you reminded me about that.
[01:40:54.923 --> 01:40:59.526]  We've got four new t-shirts that are up on the site.
[01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:03.529]  Different variants of the Join or Die or Don't Tread on Me.

[01:43:12.215 --> 01:43:14.118]  It is essential that patriots worldwide

[01:44:12.482 --> 01:44:17.528]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[01:44:17.808 --> 01:44:19.670]  Lucky for you, there's the freeze-dry guy.
[01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:26.154]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[01:44:26.354 --> 01:44:31.118]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:39.543]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[01:44:40.624 --> 01:44:47.328]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[01:44:47.508 --> 01:44:49.770]  Comparably, the advances made in food storage from
[01:44:49.770 --> 01:44:53.491]  I've got the Mayo Clinic's fact sheet about influenza virus vaccine live, nasal route.
[01:45:21.127 --> 01:45:23.029]  And I've got three stacks of news on the flu.
[01:45:23.069 --> 01:45:24.470]  I'm going to collate through this.
[01:45:25.671 --> 01:45:29.375]  At eight after next hour, I'm going to do a segment on flu, the latest developments.
[01:45:29.455 --> 01:45:35.720]  I kind of procrastinate when I look at the stack and go, oh, because it's so horrible and so unbelievable.
[01:45:37.542 --> 01:45:38.663]  But it's really happening.
[01:45:38.743 --> 01:45:39.344]  Influenza.
[01:45:40.745 --> 01:45:42.346]  They admit it's going to spread the flu.
[01:45:42.366 --> 01:45:47.491]  I mean, these guys commit huge crimes right out in front of no one, and they just get away with it.
[01:45:47.511 --> 01:46:01.843]  It's like Hardin, Montana, where they have a convicted felon for scams running the police department, running the jail, running the detention center, and they admit he's a criminal, and the local boss hogs say, we don't care, he's going to run things.
[01:46:03.425 --> 01:46:05.527]  And it's like this, oh yeah, we're spreading the flu.
[01:46:07.912 --> 01:46:17.857]  And then there are fear-mongering saying it's killing large portions of pregnant women that get it, but that's out of the sick and impaired women that went to the hospital with H1N1.
[01:46:17.877 --> 01:46:19.577]  25% died.
[01:46:19.597 --> 01:46:23.719]  I mean, this flu is already on track to peak next week.
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.161]  But that was under the regular gauge.
[01:46:27.241 --> 01:46:35.445]  Now that it's been nasally sprayed into people where it will breed and then be sneezed back out on you, get ready for it to just spread like wildfire.
[01:46:37.099 --> 01:46:39.262]  And it'll be in plain view and nobody will get in trouble.
[01:46:41.665 --> 01:46:42.366]  Mayo Clinic.
[01:46:45.551 --> 01:46:47.093]  Oh, man, it's it.
[01:46:49.036 --> 01:46:52.761]  I've got to somehow get emotionally divorced from all of this because.
[01:46:56.553 --> 01:46:57.494]  It's just too much.
[01:46:57.994 --> 01:47:00.756]  It's too unbelievable that we're this bad.
[01:47:01.116 --> 01:47:02.377]  We're this stupid.
[01:47:03.778 --> 01:47:07.281]  That they're banning neighbors keeping each other's kids.
[01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:10.523]  That they're banning farms and ranches that aren't government-controlled.
[01:47:10.863 --> 01:47:14.546]  That they're banning side-of-the-road pumpkin stands.
[01:47:14.666 --> 01:47:16.728]  It's just scum!
[01:47:16.828 --> 01:47:17.828]  Government scum!
[01:47:18.749 --> 01:47:27.114]  And all the worship of government, and the PSAs, and the ads, and the Stasi's, and the citizen spies, and all of it being announced.
[01:47:27.314 --> 01:47:28.975]  Why does this have to happen?
[01:47:29.095 --> 01:47:29.816]  Why?
[01:47:29.836 --> 01:47:41.522]  And they admit all over the country small-town police are just robbing everyone on the road, stealing their wallets, and then they don't even get in trouble?
[01:47:41.582 --> 01:47:42.203]  I mean, it's just...
[01:47:47.037 --> 01:47:48.458]  Maybe there is something wrong with me.
[01:47:48.538 --> 01:47:50.358]  Maybe this is good.
[01:47:51.078 --> 01:47:52.539]  Maybe it's good they're spreading the flu.
[01:47:52.579 --> 01:47:54.360]  Maybe it's good they're putting poison in the water.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:58.761]  Maybe it's good they've gone from 1 in 25,000 with autism to 1 in 96.
[01:47:59.841 --> 01:48:04.703]  Maybe it's good they're putting sodium fluoride in the water, which they admit doubles bone cancer.
[01:48:05.904 --> 01:48:07.264]  One of the hundreds of things.
[01:48:07.344 --> 01:48:08.845]  Maybe dying of bone cancer is good.
[01:48:08.885 --> 01:48:09.765]  Maybe I've been wrong.
[01:48:10.868 --> 01:48:12.491]  I mean, how do these people like it?
[01:48:12.551 --> 01:48:13.652]  How do they think it's funny?
[01:48:13.993 --> 01:48:16.777]  How do I get the way they are and not care anymore?
[01:48:17.739 --> 01:48:24.249]  Maybe there is something wrong with me that I'm at a hotel after leaving foreign mercenaries taking over a town.
[01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:31.389]  I go to the Billings Hotel and there's police and Homeland Security with little kids training them to be spies.
[01:48:32.269 --> 01:48:34.650]  And maybe I should have just gone, oh, thank you, spies.
[01:48:35.010 --> 01:48:36.011]  It's so American.
[01:48:36.271 --> 01:48:40.933]  Maybe I should have just fallen down on my knees and began worshipping them.
[01:48:41.774 --> 01:48:45.775]  Maybe I should have just, you know, maybe there is something wrong with me.
[01:48:45.815 --> 01:48:51.938]  Maybe I've got something wrong with me that seeing a bunch of kids being trained to spy on their parents is bad.
[01:48:53.319 --> 01:48:55.200]  Maybe I am the bad person.
[01:48:56.311 --> 01:49:01.654]  I mean, let me ask you guys, is it bad that I don't think the state should be training people's kids to spy on their parents?
[01:49:02.914 --> 01:49:03.775]  Maybe that's good!
[01:49:06.016 --> 01:49:07.497]  Jaron Neihardt, do you have any comments?
[01:49:08.557 --> 01:49:11.319]  No, I mean, seriously, maybe we are bad!
[01:49:11.819 --> 01:49:15.581]  Maybe kids spying on their parents, trained by the feds, is normal.
[01:49:16.241 --> 01:49:17.922]  Maybe Nazi Germany was good.
[01:49:18.202 --> 01:49:19.703]  Maybe Stalinist Russia was good.
[01:49:19.943 --> 01:49:20.884]  Maybe Mao was good.
[01:49:21.184 --> 01:49:24.706]  Maybe we were the bad guys 50, 60 years ago saying that was bad.
[01:49:25.785 --> 01:49:27.526]  Maybe Hitler and Mao were right.
[01:49:27.947 --> 01:49:29.028]  Maybe Lenin was right.
[01:49:29.128 --> 01:49:30.829]  Maybe we are the bad guys.
[01:49:31.229 --> 01:49:33.972]  Maybe George Washington, like FEMA teaches, is bad.
[01:49:35.032 --> 01:49:36.874]  Maybe Thomas Jefferson is bad.
[01:49:37.654 --> 01:49:39.976]  Maybe the UN's right.
[01:49:50.632 --> 01:49:53.553]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:49:54.013 --> 01:49:57.174]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:49:57.634 --> 01:50:01.996]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:50:02.216 --> 01:50:07.798]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:50:08.098 --> 01:50:12.582]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:50:12.862 --> 01:50:15.904]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:50:16.485 --> 01:50:20.908]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:50:21.309 --> 01:50:27.614]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:50:27.874 --> 01:50:29.816]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:50:30.296 --> 01:50:33.117]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:50:33.497 --> 01:50:37.558]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[01:50:37.998 --> 01:50:39.758]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:50:39.778 --> 01:50:40.158]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:50:40.178 --> 01:50:40.218]  877-327-0365.
[01:50:40.518 --> 01:50:40.758]  Don't wait.
[01:50:40.778 --> 01:50:41.318]  Call today.
[01:50:41.398 --> 01:50:42.439]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:50:42.499 --> 01:50:43.699]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:51:07.194 --> 01:51:13.256]  You know, cutting all the sarcasm.
[01:51:15.437 --> 01:51:16.677]  Folks, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:51:17.157 --> 01:51:18.638]  I don't have to tell most of you that.
[01:51:21.499 --> 01:51:23.139]  I don't know what we're going to do.
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.541]  Hardcore classical tyranny is running wild.
[01:51:30.074 --> 01:51:31.414]  I can't believe how bad it is.
[01:51:31.574 --> 01:51:35.795]  I mean, I'm not even looking for this stuff, and it's staring me in the eye everywhere.
[01:51:37.496 --> 01:51:43.377]  And I know they're putting stuff in the vaccines to give us brain damage and cancer, and it pisses me off, man.
[01:51:43.417 --> 01:51:44.737]  I want to bring these people to justice.
[01:51:50.678 --> 01:51:56.659]  But somehow, we've got to get other people to have a hunger to bring these criminals to justice.
[01:51:58.940 --> 01:51:59.760]  Somehow, we've got to
[01:52:01.687 --> 01:52:02.707]  Reach out to the public.
[01:52:02.828 --> 01:52:09.530]  And I know we're trying, and I know our numbers are growing, but... No, let's just go to your phone calls, and I'm gonna cover the flu and everything else.
[01:52:11.611 --> 01:52:17.234]  Let's go ahead and talk to, uh... Oh, who's up next here?
[01:52:18.954 --> 01:52:19.895]  Janet in Michigan.
[01:52:19.915 --> 01:52:21.115]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:52:21.696 --> 01:52:22.556]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:52:22.616 --> 01:52:23.076]  How are you?
[01:52:23.596 --> 01:52:24.377]  I'm doing alright.
[01:52:24.977 --> 01:52:27.158]  Well, my... This is my opinion.
[01:52:27.598 --> 01:52:29.199]  With all the shit that I've seen,
[01:52:30.612 --> 01:52:32.173]  Man, we're going to have to let you go, okay?
[01:52:32.593 --> 01:52:34.154]  This is a syndicated radio show.
[01:52:34.875 --> 01:52:38.377]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:52:39.577 --> 01:52:43.860]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rachel in Oregon.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.961]  Rachel, you're on the air.
[01:52:45.001 --> 01:52:45.441]  Go ahead.
[01:52:45.461 --> 01:52:47.242]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[01:52:47.582 --> 01:52:47.942]  Pretty good.
[01:52:48.903 --> 01:52:59.209]  I'm calling because I was in traffic the other day in downtown Portland and I saw a vehicle that had police written on it.
[01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:11.959]  In the big letters, but above it, and it just passed us in the intersection, it said federal and then after it was one word and then below it another.
[01:53:12.788 --> 01:53:13.568]  I think it's federal.
[01:53:13.588 --> 01:53:18.591]  No, no, they do have federal and what they call national police that are federal showing up everywhere.
[01:53:18.631 --> 01:53:20.772]  I see them all the time here in Austin.
[01:53:21.652 --> 01:53:25.014]  And I mean, think about Obama saying, I want year-round school.
[01:53:25.394 --> 01:53:28.315]  States won't get their money unless they have 12 months of school.
[01:53:28.895 --> 01:53:32.237]  How did the federal government... These are not independent school districts.
[01:53:32.257 --> 01:53:39.360]  They're little local whorehouse groups that get federal money that came from the states to begin with to follow their orders.
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.321]  And it's disgusting.
[01:53:43.054 --> 01:53:47.237]  Now, are these new, or are they just something I haven't noticed before?
[01:53:49.178 --> 01:53:57.384]  We first started seeing federal police back in the early 1990s, but no, under Homeland Security, they're federalizing everything.
[01:53:59.185 --> 01:54:01.726]  Every major department's already been completely federalized.
[01:54:02.847 --> 01:54:05.289]  And they're even putting Army liaisons in.
[01:54:06.525 --> 01:54:13.872]  And they're putting them into these threat fusion centers, normally run by the Pentagon, and they every month show the cops a new feature.
[01:54:14.392 --> 01:54:17.075]  Oh, today we're going to show you how to track everybody in real time.
[01:54:17.575 --> 01:54:19.177]  And the cops are just happy to be there.
[01:54:19.197 --> 01:54:21.079]  They're honored members of the department.
[01:54:21.119 --> 01:54:22.820]  And FEMA gets up and says,
[01:54:24.011 --> 01:54:35.038]  Under an emergency system, when we're looking for terrorists or criminals, you just put in their social security number and all known cell phones registered under their name, under the Telecommunications Act, come up live.
[01:54:35.658 --> 01:54:38.079]  So they put in Alex Jones' social security number and bloop!
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:41.762]  There he is, right there on this street in South Austin.
[01:54:42.982 --> 01:54:46.024]  And, you know, they just keep introducing the new slave grid.
[01:54:46.044 --> 01:54:48.866]  Oh, now here's a license plate reading system.
[01:54:49.707 --> 01:54:53.969]  Then they tell them, if anybody does anything, go ahead and put them in a database.
[01:54:54.349 --> 01:54:56.790]  Put as many Americans as you can in the database.
[01:54:58.330 --> 01:55:00.771]  And they just turned them all into a little federal secret police.
[01:55:05.153 --> 01:55:17.058]  We thought Portland was going to be pretty difficult to get to pass the flu, because there's a lot of people here who would probably oppose it, but it's getting stranger and stranger out here.
[01:55:17.805 --> 01:55:18.085]  It is.
[01:55:18.125 --> 01:55:18.685]  God bless you.
[01:55:18.725 --> 01:55:19.526]  Good to hear from you.
[01:55:19.726 --> 01:55:20.626]  It is getting insane.
[01:55:20.666 --> 01:55:23.367]  It doesn't matter if your town's liberal, your town's conservative.
[01:55:25.848 --> 01:55:26.868]  They just come in.
[01:55:27.428 --> 01:55:30.309]  Look, most mayors and county commissioners are social climbers.
[01:55:30.810 --> 01:55:39.113]  And they get taken to the statehouse, they get taken to federal meetings, they get flown to meetings, and they're told, you move up the power structure if you implement this.
[01:55:39.753 --> 01:55:42.734]  And the same global system is being implemented worldwide.
[01:55:44.639 --> 01:55:49.902]  They're making neighbor kids visiting your kids at your house illegal worldwide.
[01:55:50.442 --> 01:55:52.123]  They're making being normal illegal.
[01:55:52.163 --> 01:55:53.944]  They're making just living your life illegal.
[01:55:56.085 --> 01:55:57.266]  They're doing it everywhere.
[01:56:01.343 --> 01:56:03.944]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:56:04.365 --> 01:56:09.327]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:56:09.688 --> 01:56:11.409]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:56:11.729 --> 01:56:16.552]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:56:16.732 --> 01:56:17.692]  How much do you want?
[01:56:17.912 --> 01:56:18.673]  When do you want it?
[01:56:19.053 --> 01:56:20.634]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:56:20.914 --> 01:56:21.754]  When will you need it?
[01:56:21.995 --> 01:56:24.056]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:56:24.196 --> 01:56:25.316]  Will there be any food?
[01:56:25.537 --> 01:56:26.137]  Will it make your
[01:56:26.277 --> 01:56:26.878]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:56:44.975 --> 01:56:47.736]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:57:00.273 --> 01:57:05.460]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:09.946]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:57:10.106 --> 01:57:11.969]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:57:12.389 --> 01:57:13.751]  You don't have to cooperate.

[01:58:01.972 --> 01:58:03.173]  Remain in your houses.
[01:58:03.974 --> 01:58:09.140]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:10.741]  Will they do it?
[01:58:11.102 --> 01:58:13.064]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:58:13.724 --> 01:58:19.751]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:58:20.191 --> 01:58:21.452]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:58:22.373 --> 01:58:25.897]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:58:26.658 --> 01:58:30.942]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:58:31.543 --> 01:58:35.808]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:58:36.448 --> 01:58:41.273]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:58:42.174 --> 01:58:50.280]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.

[01:58:56.164 --> 01:58:59.106]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[01:59:01.528 --> 01:59:03.729]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:59:04.290 --> 01:59:07.052]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:15.655 --> 01:59:27.706]  Right here in Austin, Texas, they're announcing that you'll be thrown out of school and then be arrested if you don't take the regular flu shot and then the H1N1.
[01:59:28.727 --> 01:59:33.912]  So really what's happening here is we are seeing
[01:59:35.644 --> 01:59:44.834]  A precedent being set where school children, healthcare workers, you name it, have to take the flu shot.
[01:59:44.874 --> 01:59:49.820]  We're seeing that added to the list of 60 plus vaccines they claim are mandatory.
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:55.226]  Now remember, Governor Rick Perry claimed that the Gardasil shot was mandatory.
[01:59:56.107 --> 01:59:57.168]  Now, that was a lie.
[01:59:57.908 --> 02:00:17.539]  He just put it on the list of health departments, state health department, listed mandatory under policy, then public schools lied, and would kick you out for truancy, saying you'd violated policy if you hadn't taken it, never telling you there was a waiver they were supposed to give you for the policy under state law.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:21.982]  So, even if you're for these shots, it's all fraud-driven.
[02:00:25.523 --> 02:00:28.526]  So it says, should healthcare workers be required to get flu shot?
[02:00:28.566 --> 02:00:29.927]  And all over the nation they are.
[02:00:30.508 --> 02:00:31.889]  All over the nation they're suing.
[02:00:32.249 --> 02:00:34.271]  Before I get to the flu news, I wanted to show you this.
[02:00:34.812 --> 02:00:37.634]  CCTV website recruits video vigilantes.
[02:00:38.155 --> 02:00:39.116]  Governments in the U.S.
[02:00:39.136 --> 02:00:47.303]  and England are paying people to spy, they call it volunteer though, but then they pay you, to spy on the surveillance cameras and report to police.
[02:00:47.323 --> 02:00:48.444]  They want you to be involved in it.
[02:00:49.125 --> 02:00:50.266]  Here's the New York Times.
[02:00:50.606 --> 02:00:56.771]  They say license plate scanning readers are spreading all over the city now.
[02:00:57.131 --> 02:00:59.133]  See, the whole country's already got these.
[02:00:59.153 --> 02:01:00.414]  They're just announcing them to you now.
[02:01:00.834 --> 02:01:01.815]  I wanted to show that to you.
[02:01:01.855 --> 02:01:03.096]  Now, getting back into flu.
[02:01:04.877 --> 02:01:13.964]  Here is just the regular influenza virus vaccine, one of the big five brands, and it says contains the Marisol, a mercury derivative, as a preservative.
[02:01:17.993 --> 02:01:24.335]  And if you calculate the 25 MCGs, that is roughly five times what it had previously.
[02:01:25.215 --> 02:01:28.696]  So, they're on the news saying it's not in there, it's in all five brands.
[02:01:29.116 --> 02:01:37.218]  And there's even more in the regular one, and there's even more of the adjuvant, squalene, in there.
[02:01:37.558 --> 02:01:44.840]  So, this much squalene killed large percentages of the troops that were forced to take it with the anthrax and smallpox.
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:46.621]  They don't care, they're doing it here.
[02:01:49.983 --> 02:01:50.863]  I wanted to get to this.
[02:01:50.983 --> 02:01:52.844]  This is from The Nation Magazine.
[02:01:53.284 --> 02:01:55.144]  Human vaccine test put off again.
[02:01:55.484 --> 02:01:58.585]  They are not doing an H1N1 test.
[02:01:58.985 --> 02:02:01.886]  This is an unapproved, but under Level 6 U.N.
[02:02:01.926 --> 02:02:02.606]  emergency.
[02:02:03.046 --> 02:02:05.406]  They are going to market today.
[02:02:07.207 --> 02:02:07.847]  With the first 200,000.
[02:02:08.767 --> 02:02:10.768]  First they said they didn't have 200 million shots.
[02:02:10.908 --> 02:02:12.308]  They announced today the Feds did.
[02:02:14.741 --> 02:02:16.423]  That they have 200 million ready.
[02:02:17.624 --> 02:02:23.529]  200 million or two-thirds of the 300 million population in this country with another 100 million being made.
[02:02:23.549 --> 02:02:26.812]  They're acting like police are guarding it when it's delivered.
[02:02:27.152 --> 02:02:28.073]  Everyone wants it.
[02:02:28.093 --> 02:02:29.074]  There's long lines.
[02:02:29.374 --> 02:02:32.296]  Yeah, hypochondriac idiots who want to get it.
[02:02:33.558 --> 02:02:39.222]  They're hyping up of a hundred women who had the H1N1 who went to the hospital of the sickest who already went.
[02:02:39.242 --> 02:02:39.943]  23 died or one-fifth
[02:02:44.005 --> 02:02:52.408]  They don't tell you when you read deeper that they all had pre-existing conditions or that it's killing much less than the regular flu, but here's what's scary.
[02:02:52.868 --> 02:03:04.793]  They haven't tested it, but they're rolling out with the first 10 million dosages starting today with a live
[02:03:08.095 --> 02:03:10.876]  Virus, and I saw this on Fox this morning.
[02:03:10.916 --> 02:03:17.817]  I mean, I already knew this, but to see them admit, oh yes, it's live and it may give some people the flu, but that's okay.
[02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:25.239]  And so they spray it in their nasal passage, the virus grows in the sinus, and then they sneeze it on you.
[02:03:26.339 --> 02:03:31.460]  And so the hospitals will now, and the police departments, will now become giant incubation centers.
[02:03:32.526 --> 02:03:38.007]  And it's a religion to these cops to do what they're told, so they're gonna go, oh, I love it, I love the government.
[02:03:38.487 --> 02:03:43.128]  And let me tell you, you guys doing this are out of your minds, and some of you will undoubtedly have adverse reactions or die.
[02:03:43.528 --> 02:03:52.770]  By the way, don't believe me on that front, here is the Mayo Clinic, one of the most respected virology centers in the country.
[02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:57.070]  Influenza virus vaccine live.
[02:03:58.131 --> 02:04:00.611]  I'm reading from the headline, nasal route.
[02:04:03.075 --> 02:04:10.618]  Not the innomuscular or the echodermis or the different ways they deliver it under the skin or under the muscle.
[02:04:11.319 --> 02:04:12.779]  No, this is the nasal round.
[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:14.820]  In the snout.
[02:04:16.121 --> 02:04:20.382]  Influenza virus vaccine live nasal round.
[02:04:21.123 --> 02:04:22.823]  And this is a live H1N1.
[02:04:23.004 --> 02:04:25.685]  And this is the...
[02:04:26.841 --> 02:04:41.308]  All five of these companies patented and cloned this exact DNA sequence, RNA sequence, excuse me, in 2007 and got patents, and that's why they said, oh, we'll have this in a few months, not six months to a year like normal, because we already had it!
[02:04:42.088 --> 02:04:51.378]  Then they admit in last year's vaccine program, they had virus simulants, and then you go look at what that means, or virus tracker, it means live virus.
[02:04:51.959 --> 02:04:54.542]  They put this crap out in the other hemisphere.
[02:04:54.742 --> 02:04:56.004]  That's where this all came from.
[02:04:56.424 --> 02:05:02.210]  That's why top virologists have said, yeah, we've looked at this under electron microscopes, this was clearly made in a lab.
[02:05:03.152 --> 02:05:03.292]  Now,
[02:05:04.926 --> 02:05:06.387]  Do they know something we don't know?
[02:05:06.487 --> 02:05:07.647]  Is this going to mutate now?
[02:05:08.107 --> 02:05:12.069]  Because they said that if the nasal was live, it would be mega deadly.
[02:05:12.509 --> 02:05:16.010]  Because that's where it's guaranteed in millions of people to mutate.
[02:05:16.491 --> 02:05:18.651]  And it's probably going to mutate into a bad form.
[02:05:18.671 --> 02:05:20.532]  Because you'll have hundreds of different mutations.
[02:05:21.352 --> 02:05:26.254]  And then the very same bastards will just sit up there and go, we don't know why everybody's starting to die.
[02:05:26.554 --> 02:05:28.435]  Take your shots!
[02:05:28.995 --> 02:05:30.556]  We told you so!
[02:05:30.576 --> 02:05:32.737]  I mean, is that what we're about to see happen?
[02:05:33.988 --> 02:05:35.749]  There's no end to you criminals.
[02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:37.629]  There's no end to you people.
[02:05:40.170 --> 02:05:46.492]  And they go on to list the hundreds of medical conditions and the hundreds of drugs that if you're on them, don't take it.
[02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:50.793]  But I'll guarantee you, at your local pediatrician clinic, they're mainly giving this to kids.
[02:05:51.514 --> 02:05:53.955]  They don't tell you, it says in here, don't give it to little kids.
[02:05:55.955 --> 02:05:56.655]  I'll guarantee it.
[02:05:56.675 --> 02:05:57.096]  Look at this.
[02:06:00.083 --> 02:06:01.723]  And by the way, Burmese is doing great research.
[02:06:01.743 --> 02:06:02.684]  He keeps handing me articles.
[02:06:02.744 --> 02:06:08.305]  I want him to give this all to Paul Watson and Kurt DePost in our developing flu section.
[02:06:08.605 --> 02:06:10.006]  This is where you can go read it for yourself.
[02:06:11.146 --> 02:06:15.547]  In deciding to use a vaccine, the risk of taking a vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do.
[02:06:15.867 --> 02:06:18.828]  Wait, I thought Reuters said there's no bad any of these can do.
[02:06:19.168 --> 02:06:20.488]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[02:06:20.868 --> 02:06:24.469]  The CDC secret documents don't say it causes neurological disorders.
[02:06:24.489 --> 02:06:26.010]  Of course they do say that, but
[02:06:27.017 --> 02:06:33.242]  I heard Dr. Dina Dell Sunday on the radio saying, it's a conspiracy, it will hurt no one, it's impossible, it will only help you.
[02:06:35.964 --> 02:06:36.544]  Total lie.
[02:06:38.325 --> 02:06:39.606]  I mean, here's the Mayo Clinic.
[02:06:40.667 --> 02:06:45.310]  In deciding to use a vaccine, the risk of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do.
[02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:47.252]  By the way, that's on the flu inserts.
[02:06:47.792 --> 02:06:50.194]  The flu inserts admit this can sterilize you.
[02:06:50.534 --> 02:06:52.395]  This has been associated with infertility.
[02:06:52.656 --> 02:06:54.157]  This has been associated with cancer.
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:07:01.585]  Yeah, you start shooting, so you're meant to get a tiny bit of flu and then get immunity to it.
[02:07:02.346 --> 02:07:04.127]  Maybe a few viruses go into your nose.
[02:07:04.428 --> 02:07:10.373]  They say it might take 45, 50 viruses in one droplet of water to then replicate and for you to catch it.
[02:07:12.014 --> 02:07:23.164]  But instead, when they put millions of live viruses up your nose instead of 25 or 50 on average, your body doesn't know what to do and it has a storm of autoimmune response.
[02:07:26.513 --> 02:07:27.634]  And that's just one problem.
[02:07:28.094 --> 02:07:32.218]  And you do that over and over again, your body just gives up after a while and you get cancer.
[02:07:33.199 --> 02:07:35.941]  Because your body just gives up.
[02:07:36.001 --> 02:07:37.923]  You burn out your autoimmune system.
[02:07:37.943 --> 02:07:51.435]  It's like post-traumatic stress disorder, where you put troops in frontline battle for two, three, four tours, their adrenal glands are fried, their brain is fried, they're basket cases, they're only happy when they're in a bar fight or killing somebody.
[02:07:51.455 --> 02:07:53.557]  Because that's the only time they feel alive.
[02:07:55.143 --> 02:07:59.927]  Executives and business people and performers have their own form of post-traumatic stress.
[02:08:01.028 --> 02:08:03.329]  They're low energy when they're not on the stage.
[02:08:03.870 --> 02:08:04.750]  I've experienced this.
[02:08:04.791 --> 02:08:07.973]  You go do four hours of high-intensity radio, you get tired.
[02:08:08.373 --> 02:08:11.396]  It's hundreds of times worse when you're in combat, I've been told.
[02:08:11.996 --> 02:08:17.340]  The intensity of it, or being a cop who sees a lot of really, you know, bad stuff.
[02:08:18.041 --> 02:08:19.522]  That's why it screws them up.
[02:08:20.182 --> 02:08:21.824]  It's the same thing with, that's your brain.
[02:08:23.266 --> 02:08:30.307]  Imagine your endocrine system being pumped full of all these shots that jack it up, jack it up, jack it up, jack it up, jack it up.
[02:08:30.787 --> 02:08:34.848]  You're meant to get 25 to 50 viruses in you and get an autoimmunity to those.
[02:08:37.289 --> 02:08:39.669]  You're attacked by a few troops, not a million.
[02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:50.271]  That's why autoimmune diseases, cancer, brain damage, and we have scientist after scientist, top scientist.
[02:08:51.468 --> 02:08:52.609]  Like Dr. Blaylock.
[02:08:52.829 --> 02:08:55.250]  This guy invented a whole bunch of famous brain surgeries.
[02:08:55.550 --> 02:09:00.352]  His term, excitotoxicity, is now in major medical literature and been proven.
[02:09:00.532 --> 02:09:02.013]  He wrote about it 25 years ago.
[02:09:02.513 --> 02:09:05.194]  He coined dozens and dozens of terms.
[02:09:05.494 --> 02:09:06.274]  He will break it.
[02:09:06.474 --> 02:09:07.635]  They all know.
[02:09:08.415 --> 02:09:10.596]  All the brain scientists know what's going on.
[02:09:12.437 --> 02:09:14.378]  MSG, hardcore drug.
[02:09:14.858 --> 02:09:16.179]  Aspartame, hardcore drug.
[02:09:16.379 --> 02:09:17.519]  Do you know what aspartame is?
[02:09:17.599 --> 02:09:19.000]  It's a genetic engineer product.
[02:09:20.205 --> 02:09:26.526]  The Army wanted to feed toxic waste to bacteria and have bacteria be able to eat it in an oil spill test.
[02:09:27.347 --> 02:09:28.727]  Then they found a chemical weapon.
[02:09:28.807 --> 02:09:30.187]  Then they decided to put it in your drinks.
[02:09:30.427 --> 02:09:31.588]  Then in 9,000 foods.
[02:09:31.868 --> 02:09:32.688]  It's called aspartame.
[02:09:33.028 --> 02:09:40.189]  It is the defecation of a specially engineered type of bacteria, an E. coli.
[02:09:40.569 --> 02:09:41.070]  Don't believe me?
[02:09:41.110 --> 02:09:42.010]  Go pull it up for yourself.
[02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:46.251]  Manufacturing process of that, of aspartame.
[02:09:46.271 --> 02:09:47.191]  You can read it for yourself.
[02:09:48.636 --> 02:09:49.993]  You'll be on university websites.
[02:09:52.642 --> 02:09:54.883]  They feed you bacteria feces.
[02:09:55.003 --> 02:09:56.163]  You eat it with pleasure.
[02:09:56.783 --> 02:09:58.104]  They inject you with mercury.
[02:09:58.404 --> 02:10:00.144]  You worship your brain-damaged children.
[02:10:00.805 --> 02:10:02.745]  Everyone, like, makes it a little ninny-fest.
[02:10:03.105 --> 02:10:04.086]  Look at their brain damage.
[02:10:04.306 --> 02:10:05.826]  Ha-ha, more shots, more shots.
[02:10:06.226 --> 02:10:20.811]  It's all just sick fun, and it's all just sickening, and sickening, everybody dying of AIDS and cancer, and just sickening, and getting into it, and going to banquets together, and whining about it, and never finding out what's doing it.
[02:10:21.511 --> 02:10:45.983]  And then it just goes on as they pump live virus in, and they list hundreds of drugs and hundreds of... I mean, just page after page, if you've got this illness, if you've got that illness, if you're allergic to eggs, if you're allergic to bee stings, if you're... I told you, because if you're already allergic to stuff, you sure... I mean, if you can't take a little bee putting maybe one thousandth of a toxic chemical into you that what a shot does, you sure can't take a shot!
[02:10:49.477 --> 02:10:53.041]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:10:53.081 --> 02:10:55.945]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:11:09.105 --> 02:11:15.750]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy.
[02:11:16.090 --> 02:11:21.373]  If we, the people, do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:11:21.794 --> 02:11:28.218]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[02:11:28.598 --> 02:11:34.382]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[02:11:34.782 --> 02:11:37.004]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[02:11:37.384 --> 02:11:38.865]  Utopia Silver carries some of
[02:11:38.865 --> 02:11:42.687]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[02:12:08.865 --> 02:12:09.886]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:12:10.127 --> 02:12:16.535]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:12:17.156 --> 02:12:25.688]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:12:26.055 --> 02:12:32.861]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:12:33.161 --> 02:12:36.204]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:12:36.324 --> 02:12:41.569]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:44.732]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:12:45.172 --> 02:12:51.017]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:12:51.218 --> 02:12:52.419]  Or order the DVD at
[02:12:54.377 --> 02:12:56.104]  Don't expose the government-sponsored terror.
[02:12:56.546 --> 02:12:59.037]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:13:00.469 --> 02:13:01.449]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:13:01.530 --> 02:13:06.312]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:13:06.472 --> 02:13:14.276]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:13:14.536 --> 02:13:19.898]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:13:20.119 --> 02:13:27.102]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:13:27.402 --> 02:13:32.724]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:13:32.984 --> 02:13:37.706]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:13:38.067 --> 02:13:45.630]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:52.235]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:13:52.555 --> 02:13:53.756]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:13:53.816 --> 02:13:54.016]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:00.322 --> 02:14:05.104]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[02:14:05.484 --> 02:14:05.884]  I'm not.
[02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:06.664]  Don't trust it.
[02:14:06.744 --> 02:14:08.625]  But then I don't want to get the disease either.
[02:14:08.985 --> 02:14:14.407]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[02:14:14.687 --> 02:14:17.148]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[02:14:17.248 --> 02:14:21.329]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[02:14:21.809 --> 02:14:24.530]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[02:14:24.970 --> 02:14:30.395]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:31.996]  That's NoGerms.info.
[02:14:32.958 --> 02:14:41.266]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[02:14:41.506 --> 02:14:47.191]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[02:14:47.471 --> 02:14:52.376]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[02:14:52.596 --> 02:14:54.277]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[02:14:54.337 --> 02:14:56.059]  That's NoGerms.info.
[02:14:56.559 --> 02:14:58.061]  Be well and stay well.
[02:14:58.281 --> 02:14:59.002]  Best MZ.
[02:15:01.713 --> 02:15:06.855]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:07.535 --> 02:15:09.856]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:15:11.197 --> 02:15:12.898]  You know, I'm gonna be honest with listeners.
[02:15:14.150 --> 02:15:17.593]  I got so focused on this Hardin thing and I dropped the ball on the flu.
[02:15:18.413 --> 02:15:23.437]  It's shaping up to be more outrageous and worse than I had originally thought.
[02:15:24.057 --> 02:15:28.681]  And we're going to be covering this with a lot of informative guests this week and next week.
[02:15:28.701 --> 02:15:29.962]  Go ahead and bring it in to me, Burmas.
[02:15:30.002 --> 02:15:34.125]  I couldn't find my article about them kicking people out of school here in Austin if they don't take the shot.
[02:15:34.665 --> 02:15:35.346]  Yeah, Austin.
[02:15:35.426 --> 02:15:36.627]  Immunization requirements.
[02:15:37.007 --> 02:15:43.052]  Yeah, this is AISD saying you must take all the flu shots or you can't go to school and they're never telling you there's a waiver.
[02:15:43.592 --> 02:15:44.774]  Just absolute criminals.
[02:15:46.197 --> 02:15:50.605]  But no, I mean, I want the actual news articles that talk about it too, though.
[02:15:51.647 --> 02:15:52.268]  So thank you.
[02:15:52.769 --> 02:15:54.011]  It's here somewhere in my stack.
[02:15:54.372 --> 02:15:55.774]  But let me go over this right now.
[02:15:57.711 --> 02:16:02.035]  Look at this article out of Eyewitness 12 CBS News.
[02:16:02.896 --> 02:16:03.977]  This is out of Kansas.
[02:16:05.017 --> 02:16:10.002]  Volunteers should be prepared to sign a confidentiality agreement and stand for long periods.
[02:16:10.782 --> 02:16:14.506]  So, they're saying that they're about to start giving people the H1N1.
[02:16:15.026 --> 02:16:19.630]  They don't tell you that they already stuck it in the new regular seasonal flu.
[02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:21.071]  It says it on the insert.
[02:16:21.909 --> 02:16:23.472]  They're already trying to spread it that way.
[02:16:24.013 --> 02:16:29.602]  Or that the 10 million dosages of the nasal spray is a live virus that will spread it.
[02:16:31.408 --> 02:16:40.212]  But they're so confident in this not hurting you that they make you sign a confidentiality agreement waiving liability and that you won't talk about it.
[02:16:40.653 --> 02:16:41.853]  Obviously they're not confident.
[02:16:42.073 --> 02:16:43.994]  Now let me finish up with the Mayo Clinic.
[02:16:44.715 --> 02:16:49.817]  This is the Mayo Clinic influenza virus vaccine live nasal route.
[02:16:50.117 --> 02:16:52.539]  This is the one 10 million people start taking today.
[02:16:53.959 --> 02:16:58.382]  That is live and breathes in the sinus and then they sneeze it all over you and your family.
[02:16:59.222 --> 02:17:00.863]  And it's gonna mutate, guaranteed!
[02:17:02.219 --> 02:17:03.320]  And kill a bunch more people!
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:06.943]  And they love it, because they know the stupid public doesn't understand urology!
[02:17:09.405 --> 02:17:19.653]  I'm getting so sick of the government, and so sick of the filth, and so sick of the son-of-a-bitch White House science czar who writes 1,100-page books about how he wants to kill us with crap in the vaccines.
[02:17:20.374 --> 02:17:21.135]  Eco-science.
[02:17:21.575 --> 02:17:25.338]  I mean, can't you listen to the psychos when they tell you what they're doing to you?
[02:17:26.019 --> 02:17:28.100]  Is there nothing you won't believe out there?
[02:17:29.081 --> 02:17:30.502]  Now, this is the Mayo Clinic.
[02:17:31.383 --> 02:17:32.944]  You'll never see this on the news.
[02:17:33.324 --> 02:17:36.325]  This is what's with the vaccine inserts.
[02:17:38.045 --> 02:17:39.346]  It says it's got mercury in it.
[02:17:40.026 --> 02:17:41.687]  It says it's got other stuff.
[02:17:42.527 --> 02:17:45.088]  It says that it also is connected to Guillain-Barre.
[02:17:45.208 --> 02:17:48.449]  In fact, I just had a highlighted copy I was running around with in the office.
[02:17:52.911 --> 02:17:54.852]  And it goes through all the things it does.
[02:17:54.992 --> 02:17:55.932]  Other interactions.
[02:17:57.092 --> 02:17:58.213]  Other medical problems.
[02:18:01.385 --> 02:18:03.846]  Allergic reaction to anybody who has allergies.
[02:18:04.186 --> 02:18:06.408]  It can make your brain swell up and kill you deader than a hammer.
[02:18:06.788 --> 02:18:09.869]  The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine.
[02:18:10.550 --> 02:18:13.511]  Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any of the following medical problems.
[02:18:14.012 --> 02:18:23.897]  Allergic reaction of a history to eggs or egg products, gentamicin or gelatin or any amino acid
[02:18:24.946 --> 02:18:27.188]  Should not use these conditions.
[02:18:27.508 --> 02:18:28.849]  Asthma, severe wheezing.
[02:18:29.090 --> 02:18:31.071]  Everybody knows that's why everybody's getting the breathing problems.
[02:18:31.111 --> 02:18:33.834]  It causes autoimmune response in the bronchia.
[02:18:34.374 --> 02:18:36.116]  Where's the Gillian Buray's part in here?
[02:18:38.918 --> 02:18:39.679]  Just had to highlight it.
[02:18:39.759 --> 02:18:42.441]  Ask Burmas to highlight that part for me because I saw his highlighted copy.
[02:18:42.942 --> 02:18:44.723]  Thank you.
[02:18:44.923 --> 02:18:46.705]  So all of that is going on.
[02:18:48.001 --> 02:18:49.902]  And then they admit it's not even tested.
[02:18:50.302 --> 02:18:56.126]  And then they make you sign a form that you won't sue and that you waive liability if you take it.
[02:18:57.026 --> 02:19:00.949]  While meanwhile saying, oh, it's a conspiracy theory if you think this can hurt anybody.
[02:19:02.670 --> 02:19:04.631]  And trying to make school kids take it.
[02:19:05.791 --> 02:19:08.973]  And it goes on and on and on.
[02:19:09.253 --> 02:19:11.595]  Meanwhile, on the economic front, U.S.
[02:19:11.715 --> 02:19:14.316]  economic decline forges new world order.
[02:19:14.376 --> 02:19:15.197]  Hip hip hooray.
[02:19:15.637 --> 02:19:17.038]  We're going to be going over that coming up.
[02:19:23.430 --> 02:19:36.993]  And they now list here that you must attend, you must have all your vaccinations to attend schools, and they, color of law, cite chapter 381001, never telling you it says there's a waiver to the policy.
[02:19:38.393 --> 02:19:45.655]  And they say every child must be given the vaccines, including both flu shots.
[02:19:47.955 --> 02:19:48.695]  Total lies!
[02:19:50.055 --> 02:19:52.436]  But that's how they roll.
[02:19:53.376 --> 02:19:56.238]  That's how they operate.
[02:19:57.259 --> 02:20:07.848]  And there are lawsuits being filed by military people and by nursing associations saying they don't want to take the shots.
[02:20:10.345 --> 02:20:11.706]  They're medical workers.
[02:20:12.086 --> 02:20:14.047]  In a free society, you don't have to take it.
[02:20:14.307 --> 02:20:18.329]  But then the establishment says, well, if you haven't taken it, you could spread it to other people.
[02:20:18.349 --> 02:20:18.609]  Wait!
[02:20:18.949 --> 02:20:24.332]  If all the morons have had the shot, and it supposedly protects them, why would we be then bad?
[02:20:24.352 --> 02:20:24.952]  No, no.
[02:20:25.393 --> 02:20:38.739]  It's our bodies, our lives, the history of human experimentation, the history of the government killing people through different medical tests and experiments, the history of Bayer and what they put in vaccines, and all the deaths from vaccines.
[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:39.620]  No!
[02:20:41.604 --> 02:20:44.308]  If you were completely trustworthy, we shouldn't be made to take it.
[02:20:44.508 --> 02:20:46.611]  But you're a pack of murdering scum!
[02:20:47.332 --> 02:20:49.816]  But the public just can't believe it's happening to them.
[02:20:51.318 --> 02:20:52.219]  We're on the march.
[02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:54.322]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:20:55.244 --> 02:20:57.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:00.589 --> 02:21:04.550]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:21:04.830 --> 02:21:06.610]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:15.112]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:21:15.352 --> 02:21:20.574]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:21:20.894 --> 02:21:22.514]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:21:22.754 --> 02:21:29.075]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:21:29.275 --> 02:21:40.018]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:21:40.318 --> 02:21:40.838]  That's right.
[02:21:41.098 --> 02:21:43.398]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:21:43.658 --> 02:21:45.219]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[02:21:47.179 --> 02:21:47.840]  We're good to go.
[02:22:04.272 --> 02:22:07.435]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:22:07.775 --> 02:22:09.717]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:22:10.077 --> 02:22:17.743]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:22:18.424 --> 02:22:25.470]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:22:25.870 --> 02:22:32.756]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[02:22:33.246 --> 02:22:37.330]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:41.133]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:22:41.573 --> 02:22:43.475]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:22:43.835 --> 02:22:47.759]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:23:01.483 --> 02:23:01.963]  Attention!
[02:23:02.143 --> 02:23:17.211]  An important product from hempusa.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[02:23:17.512 --> 02:23:18.932]  Micro Plant Powder is 89% silica.
[02:23:20.493 --> 02:23:20.974]  We're good.
[02:23:35.526 --> 02:23:35.766]  Thank you.
[02:24:08.386 --> 02:24:17.028]  We're gonna go to Jeremy, Shelly, Taddy and Ken before the show ends.
[02:24:19.509 --> 02:24:23.690]  I found it here on page 5 of the Mayo Clinic.
[02:24:26.411 --> 02:24:34.993]  And it says that the may cause asthma, severe wheezing, may make conditions worse if you take the flu vaccine.
[02:24:36.903 --> 02:24:42.909]  Also, Guillain-Barre syndrome, history of, may cause the symptoms of this condition to return.
[02:24:45.051 --> 02:24:46.733]  It'll make immune deficiency worse.
[02:24:48.397 --> 02:24:49.518]  Uh, cancer worse.
[02:24:50.298 --> 02:24:52.899]  Human immunodeficiency, HIV worse.
[02:24:53.539 --> 02:24:54.900]  Leukemia, lymphoma.
[02:24:55.100 --> 02:24:56.341]  Hey, you like all these things?
[02:24:56.381 --> 02:24:59.042]  I mean, vaccines, folks, if you just read the inserts.
[02:24:59.522 --> 02:25:00.722]  But see, they think you're idiots.
[02:25:01.123 --> 02:25:06.825]  They have little vaccine guys in white lab coats up on TV go, it's wonderful, no one's ever been hurt by a vaccine.
[02:25:08.586 --> 02:25:09.086]  Lying!
[02:25:10.146 --> 02:25:11.767]  And then here it is, Dallas Morning News.
[02:25:12.227 --> 02:25:14.068]  Districts get tough on immunizations.
[02:25:14.348 --> 02:25:15.449]  We'll turn away some.
[02:25:16.459 --> 02:25:24.948]  Then I saw an article in the Statesman going, kids are submitting, 90 plus percent have taken their shots, you will be arrested if you don't, total lies.
[02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:30.755]  You'll be arrested for truancy because they will falsely kick you out of the government camp.
[02:25:32.742 --> 02:25:34.184]  Here's another one.
[02:25:34.204 --> 02:25:37.327]  H1N1 flu vaccinations could be here by end of the week.
[02:25:37.907 --> 02:25:38.868]  Austin Daily Herald.
[02:25:39.229 --> 02:25:43.093]  They're making the regular flu shot mandatory, but it's not mandatory.
[02:25:43.453 --> 02:25:45.515]  By the way, somewhere in my stack, I'm going to try to dig it out.
[02:25:45.555 --> 02:25:46.556]  I covered it yesterday some.
[02:25:47.137 --> 02:25:50.881]  They have mainstream British news with one of the inventors of the vaccine.
[02:25:52.995 --> 02:25:58.079]  Saying it doesn't protect you from cervical cancer and it can actually kill you and you shouldn't take it.
[02:25:58.779 --> 02:26:00.220]  Morally coming out against it.
[02:26:00.941 --> 02:26:02.702]  You'll never hear that on our news.
[02:26:06.085 --> 02:26:10.007]  They'll just have liars like Dr. Dina Dell will get up and tell you it's wonderful and good for you.
[02:26:11.068 --> 02:26:13.730]  I want to get into some financial news then back into your calls.
[02:26:15.271 --> 02:26:17.373]  And more on the economic stimulus package.
[02:26:18.598 --> 02:26:31.082]  They're admitting, the White House had their pundits on CNN and MSNBC, I was watching this morning, going, well, we know it's unpopular to call it stimulus too, because we've already taken trillions, but 400 billion's been paid back.
[02:26:31.202 --> 02:26:35.963]  No, they give trillions to the banks, they then loan the money back to the U.S.
[02:26:38.364 --> 02:26:38.924]  at interest.
[02:26:39.024 --> 02:26:40.224]  I mean, that's how the scam works.
[02:26:40.264 --> 02:26:42.365]  And then in some cases, they pay the money back.
[02:26:44.608 --> 02:26:47.210]  It's in the tens of trillions, not $700 billion.
[02:26:47.650 --> 02:26:54.456]  I've had a congressman on tape asking Bernanke, so you've loaned out the $700 billion over 30 times.
[02:26:54.516 --> 02:26:56.878]  And Bernanke's like, yes, but none of your business where it goes.
[02:26:58.459 --> 02:27:02.663]  They call that $700 billion the way it was written is a revolving credit line.
[02:27:04.144 --> 02:27:05.665]  So they just keep stealing it.
[02:27:07.574 --> 02:27:10.318]  And then they, through the banking, leverage it 10 times.
[02:27:11.038 --> 02:27:13.662]  And then leverage it again, and leverage it again, and leverage it again.
[02:27:14.323 --> 02:27:18.768]  Just like when the government launders $30,000 for a kilo of cocaine.
[02:27:19.569 --> 02:27:21.832]  They then leverage it at least 10 times out.
[02:27:23.394 --> 02:27:25.036]  You understand how banking works, folks?
[02:27:25.136 --> 02:27:26.258]  It's just diabolical.
[02:27:27.352 --> 02:27:32.296]  And then you've got them all over the news bragging, oh, the New World Order's here, oh, it's so wonderful.
[02:27:32.316 --> 02:27:34.959]  You know, here's agency French Press, U.S.
[02:27:34.999 --> 02:27:37.521]  economic decline forges New World Order.
[02:27:38.942 --> 02:27:41.324]  Oh, the carbon footprint of the U.S.
[02:27:41.384 --> 02:27:43.266]  is lowering as they go into depression.
[02:27:43.666 --> 02:27:46.108]  Oh, the new economy means you don't have a job.
[02:27:46.448 --> 02:27:49.251]  Oh, but we have a great economy, it's a jobless economy.
[02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:56.614]  I couldn't believe it two years ago when they said they were going to kill the dollar and set up a new SDR.
[02:27:56.814 --> 02:27:59.316]  You'll still have a dollar, it just won't be the world reserve currency.
[02:27:59.616 --> 02:28:00.377]  That means it's dead.
[02:28:01.118 --> 02:28:09.084]  You'll have regional currencies that are all randomly set every morning by the central banks to whatever the insider trading gives them the biggest profits.
[02:28:09.325 --> 02:28:17.632]  The private banks that engineered the Ponzi scheme are now bankrupting the planet with an even bigger Ponzi scheme and giving themselves godlike power.
[02:28:20.114 --> 02:28:20.774]  But why not?
[02:28:20.814 --> 02:28:40.519]  If a convicted 14-time con artist, swindler, mercenary from Serbia can come in and take over a giant prison in southern Montana, and then even after it comes out, the city fathers say, we love him, we love felons, literally to my face, we don't care if he's a criminal, he can run things, and we're going to lock the town up and make money off of it.
[02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:46.100]  Why not have foreign offshore banks raping us and setting up carbon taxes?
[02:28:50.501 --> 02:28:52.326]  It makes my head spin.
[02:28:55.394 --> 02:28:57.921]  I mean, we've got to get angry and say no to all of this.
[02:28:58.817 --> 02:29:07.203]  But instead, corrupt government people from Hardin, Montana, to Austin, Texas, to big cities like New York City, to beyond, they're bought and paid for.
[02:29:07.663 --> 02:29:19.551]  That's why they're passing laws in Texas, and in California, and in Michigan, saying you can't even have two neighbor kids over for breakfast, or to even stand under your doorway in the snow.
[02:29:20.132 --> 02:29:21.793]  Even if the parents of the neighbors say yes.
[02:29:23.305 --> 02:29:24.025]  Waiting for the bus.
[02:29:24.326 --> 02:29:25.906]  We're going to take your kids CPS.
[02:29:26.387 --> 02:29:28.128]  You can't sell eggs on the street corner.
[02:29:28.748 --> 02:29:30.489]  You can't have a garage sale.
[02:29:30.829 --> 02:29:33.571]  You can't do anything because you are a prisoner.
[02:29:33.631 --> 02:29:36.152]  Folks, America is now becoming a giant prison.
[02:29:36.332 --> 02:29:38.793]  They're openly announcing they're going to shut down the old web.
[02:29:38.993 --> 02:29:40.734]  They've openly handed over U.S.
[02:29:40.774 --> 02:29:41.775]  control to the U.N.
[02:29:42.095 --> 02:29:42.615]  of the Internet.
[02:29:42.635 --> 02:29:43.816]  I've got those headlines up.
[02:29:43.836 --> 02:29:45.757]  In fact, Google the term U.S.
[02:29:45.777 --> 02:29:47.158]  hands over control of Internet.
[02:29:48.393 --> 02:29:49.734]  And it's positive articles.
[02:29:49.914 --> 02:29:50.695]  Oh, wonderful!
[02:29:51.075 --> 02:29:52.036]  No, it's not wonderful.
[02:29:52.596 --> 02:29:57.140]  Now it's a total private corporation doing whatever it wants that was built with our tax money.
[02:29:58.541 --> 02:30:02.964]  The serving system, the domain system, not the physical grid.
[02:30:03.285 --> 02:30:07.888]  Obama openly announces he's taking over the internet for your, quote, safety.
[02:30:11.031 --> 02:30:14.373]  But now they're openly saying they're beginning the phase out of the dollar.
[02:30:14.453 --> 02:30:15.975]  The world is moving out of dollars.
[02:30:15.995 --> 02:30:17.456]  They're not buying as much dollars.
[02:30:19.986 --> 02:30:22.708]  No wonder gold is up above $1,017.
[02:30:23.168 --> 02:30:32.175]  When it dropped down to $990-something, Ted bought a bunch of it, and he can sell it to you, $20-$30 in the market, under what it is now.
[02:30:32.195 --> 02:30:36.979]  A month ago, he was selling it to you at $900 an ounce.
[02:30:37.259 --> 02:30:38.080]  You didn't want it then.
[02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:39.541]  Now it's over $1,000.
[02:30:40.081 --> 02:30:41.182]  Do you want it at $900-something?
[02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:46.290]  I wanted to bring Ted up.
[02:30:46.430 --> 02:30:50.772]  Ted, what is it like for you to see open North American Union being announced?
[02:30:51.112 --> 02:30:52.572]  To see open world government?
[02:30:52.612 --> 02:30:54.493]  To hear openly that they're killing the dollar?
[02:30:54.953 --> 02:30:57.634]  To just see all this happening?
[02:30:58.554 --> 02:31:08.938]  Well, it's a saddening thing, especially considering the fact that I have children and now my wife's, my step-grandchild is going to have to live through this.
[02:31:09.598 --> 02:31:14.820]  It makes me just, you know, it gives me such a sickening feeling in my gut.
[02:31:15.447 --> 02:31:16.887]  But then I'm watching it right here.
[02:31:16.947 --> 02:31:17.708]  I mean, what do we have?
[02:31:17.728 --> 02:31:21.448]  We have 200 banks that have failed already this year that are on the books.
[02:31:21.528 --> 02:31:23.909]  At least another 100 more before the year is over.
[02:31:24.549 --> 02:31:29.270]  We just have a complete collapse of the United States dollar and its value.
[02:31:29.350 --> 02:31:31.411]  I mean, right now, the dollar's down again.
[02:31:31.991 --> 02:31:32.871]  It's at $76.64.
[02:31:33.351 --> 02:31:37.932]  I mean, there just is not a lot of bright light on the horizon.
[02:31:38.293 --> 02:31:44.094]  And with this economic system that we have, we have to take on more debt in order to bail out our problems.
[02:31:44.514 --> 02:31:46.295]  How is that ever gonna help us?
[02:31:47.035 --> 02:31:48.496]  It just cannot help us.
[02:31:48.696 --> 02:31:53.078]  And Ted, the entire economy, the numbers came out, as you know, last week.
[02:31:54.379 --> 02:31:56.860]  Manufacturing, even light manufacturing, dead.
[02:31:57.320 --> 02:32:02.443]  They allow putting a hamburger together to be listed as manufacturing.
[02:32:02.823 --> 02:32:03.483]  I mean, I know.
[02:32:03.744 --> 02:32:08.286]  Putting videos in bags and shipping them to people is a manufacturing credit we've got here.
[02:32:08.846 --> 02:32:12.108]  Putting hamburgers together is a manufacturing credit
[02:32:13.081 --> 02:32:16.183]  And that's even down.
[02:32:17.144 --> 02:32:18.605]  245,000 people lost their job this month.
[02:32:19.065 --> 02:32:20.966]  I mean, more and more and more.
[02:32:21.426 --> 02:32:25.489]  And they say, oh, the new recovery means the foreign banks get rich and you're homeless.
[02:32:27.731 --> 02:32:36.220]  What you're saying is that the Federal Reserve System is bailing out their friends, they're moving the money into the accounts, and they're moving away as the banks become examined.
[02:32:36.260 --> 02:32:38.222]  I mean, it's just ridiculous what they're doing.
[02:32:38.582 --> 02:32:42.186]  If you're not part of the good ol' boy club, your bank gets shut down.
[02:32:42.486 --> 02:32:46.089]  Unemployment numbers that the government's reporting now is up to 9.8%, up from 9.6%.
[02:32:48.632 --> 02:32:49.133]  That's right.
[02:32:49.173 --> 02:32:55.800]  I had some drunk pro-war guy in Montana tell me that the government had saved the banks and had taken all banks over.
[02:32:55.860 --> 02:32:56.081]  No.
[02:32:56.541 --> 02:33:06.913]  The big regulators from JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and others on record go and shut down healthy banks and insurance companies and feed them into their mouth.
[02:33:07.785 --> 02:33:10.227]  The zombie banks are taking over the country.
[02:33:10.827 --> 02:33:15.590]  That's right, and we're getting a bigger and more wide complex.
[02:33:15.610 --> 02:33:21.714]  This military-industrial complex that you always hear about is becoming bigger and more powerful.
[02:33:22.074 --> 02:33:27.357]  Why do you think the President of the United States wants to give the Federal Reserve System more power?
[02:33:27.417 --> 02:33:29.919]  It's because he's being directed to do so.
[02:33:30.399 --> 02:33:33.082]  And that is going to destroy the value of our dollar.
[02:33:33.463 --> 02:33:35.225]  It's going to destroy our economy.
[02:33:35.545 --> 02:33:37.988]  It's going to just absolutely set it off.
[02:33:38.088 --> 02:33:38.969]  Exactly, Ted.
[02:33:39.409 --> 02:33:43.774]  And while the average person is busy loving Obama or hating Obama, he doesn't matter.
[02:33:43.814 --> 02:33:44.535]  He's a puppet.
[02:33:45.216 --> 02:33:46.017]  He's a nobody.
[02:33:46.357 --> 02:33:47.438]  That's the point, Alex.
[02:33:47.918 --> 02:33:50.300]  Obama's not any different than George Bush.
[02:33:50.380 --> 02:33:53.523]  I mean, we have more war than we had when he came in.
[02:33:53.563 --> 02:33:54.904]  He said he was going to end the wars.
[02:33:55.184 --> 02:33:57.106]  I mean, look at all the different things that he promised.
[02:33:57.366 --> 02:33:59.127]  The whole thing is a house of cards.
[02:33:59.387 --> 02:34:06.833]  These people that are put into the presidential's office are just puppets to this military-industrial complex that I'm referring to.
[02:34:07.234 --> 02:34:14.620]  It's not like the person that we would have elected as an official to represent us has really any say-so in the first place.
[02:34:15.854 --> 02:34:17.916]  But he serves as a distraction.
[02:34:18.236 --> 02:34:22.699]  They can build him up and make a big media spectacle out of it, and then destroy him.
[02:34:22.719 --> 02:34:24.460]  And I watch CNN.
[02:34:24.641 --> 02:34:28.083]  Every report is about Latinos being discriminated against or blacks.
[02:34:28.623 --> 02:34:32.086]  Everything is about balkanation and division.
[02:34:32.606 --> 02:34:33.687]  And it's so disgusting.
[02:34:33.747 --> 02:34:37.090]  Bottom line, folks, you need to get into silver and gold.
[02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:38.150]  Ted, briefly,
[02:34:39.159 --> 02:34:41.040]  Silver's way up, gold's way up today.
[02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:42.901]  Tell people where it's at in the market.
[02:34:42.921 --> 02:34:45.783]  We'll put the graph up on screen for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[02:34:46.284 --> 02:34:55.169]  Versus, versus Ted, when you bought in, so the type of savings in the market that you're factoring in.
[02:34:55.469 --> 02:35:02.053]  Well, you know, I am, I gotta say that I really like the Federal Reserve System and the central banks when they beat up the gold prices.
[02:35:02.094 --> 02:35:05.536]  And I was able to pop in there at about that high 988 level.
[02:35:07.857 --> 02:35:08.637]  To 994.
[02:35:08.677 --> 02:35:13.838]  And now gold is up again to $1,018.70.
[02:35:15.659 --> 02:35:18.499]  So obviously the market is moving in my direction again.
[02:35:19.439 --> 02:35:20.380]  You can just see it.
[02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:30.162]  It just makes it simple for people like me to be able to buy in every time they start pushing the marketplace down because you can just count on the fact that it's going to bounce back up again.
[02:35:30.462 --> 02:35:37.103]  So right now you're looking at gold about $20 to $25 less than what it's currently trading for at this particular time.
[02:35:37.483 --> 02:35:43.927]  Which equals, rather than $236 for a franc, right now I've got them at $233.
[02:35:44.807 --> 02:35:47.289]  I have the British Sovereign's currently right now at $288.
[02:35:48.129 --> 02:35:51.511]  And I've been talking about those Walking Liberty halves.
[02:35:51.571 --> 02:35:54.293]  Every time that silver takes a dip, I'm able to grab those.
[02:35:54.713 --> 02:35:56.614]  They're currently right now at $8.69.
[02:35:57.054 --> 02:36:00.335]  And I also like the $10 Liberty.
[02:36:00.395 --> 02:36:02.056]  It's a great coin to be getting into.
[02:36:02.456 --> 02:36:03.136]  They're currently at $818.50.
[02:36:03.576 --> 02:36:09.398]  And again, Alex, I gotta tell you, the market is strong.
[02:36:09.839 --> 02:36:11.919]  I have tried to get some Buffalo coins this morning.
[02:36:11.959 --> 02:36:13.360]  I thought maybe I could get some of those.
[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:17.743]  To put on the show today, and there's just no supply of them out there that I can make it.
[02:36:17.843 --> 02:36:18.223]  Absolutely.
[02:36:18.283 --> 02:36:21.565]  Historically, the fall and winter is when gold goes crazy.
[02:36:21.906 --> 02:36:26.068]  We're seeing historic, strong times right now for gold and silver.
[02:36:26.128 --> 02:36:28.250]  Folks, call Midas Resources today.
[02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:29.871]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:36:30.131 --> 02:36:31.432]  Don't trust the New World Order.
[02:36:31.692 --> 02:36:34.234]  Don't exclusively stay in stocks and bonds and the dollar.
[02:36:35.535 --> 02:36:37.936]  Physically hold the gold and silver.
[02:36:38.857 --> 02:36:39.758]  Give them the number, Ted.
[02:36:43.763 --> 02:36:43.964]  2-2-3-7.
[02:36:43.984 --> 02:36:44.266]  Again, 1-800.
[02:36:47.944 --> 02:36:47.964]  686-2237.
[02:36:49.745 --> 02:36:53.847]  Please mention that you heard it on the Alex Jones Hour.
[02:36:53.947 --> 02:36:57.369]  Otherwise, you're going to end up paying more for this stuff just because the prices have gone up.
[02:36:57.449 --> 02:36:57.830]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:57.850 --> 02:36:58.450]  This special.
[02:36:58.490 --> 02:36:59.951]  Ted's a regular capitalist.
[02:37:00.391 --> 02:37:04.214]  You know, he buys it very low markup, sells it right above market.
[02:37:04.594 --> 02:37:06.635]  He does these specials here exclusively.
[02:37:06.655 --> 02:37:07.716]  800-686-2237.
[02:37:09.177 --> 02:37:16.081]  This is a loss leader, so you can get into the market, see what a great deal it is, physically hold it, catch the gold bug,
[02:37:16.581 --> 02:37:17.722]  You know, that's what Ted's doing.
[02:37:17.742 --> 02:37:19.823]  He's not selling you crack, though, to get you addicted.
[02:37:20.083 --> 02:37:21.985]  He's selling you gold and silver to get you addicted.
[02:37:22.265 --> 02:37:23.225]  He wants you to try it.
[02:37:23.506 --> 02:37:26.367]  And believe me, this is crack that's good for you.
[02:37:26.387 --> 02:37:26.427]  800-686-2237.
[02:37:26.447 --> 02:37:28.909]  800-686-2237.
[02:37:29.149 --> 02:37:32.952]  That silver deal.
[02:37:33.032 --> 02:37:38.856]  Those franc and British sovereigns deals you heard are absolutely fabulous deals.
[02:37:38.876 --> 02:37:38.916]  800-686-2237.
[02:37:40.697 --> 02:37:44.199]  A lot of gold and silver analysts have it more than doubling in the next year.
[02:37:44.319 --> 02:37:45.340]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[02:37:45.660 --> 02:37:48.643]  The point is, I know they can't completely devalue this.
[02:37:49.043 --> 02:37:51.766]  I know it's a hedge against inflation and globalist control.
[02:37:52.086 --> 02:37:55.549]  I know the globalists hoard gold and silver while telling us not to own it.
[02:37:56.390 --> 02:37:58.491]  Give the Midas Resources brokers a call.
[02:37:59.072 --> 02:38:00.774]  It's low sales pitch.
[02:38:00.814 --> 02:38:01.895]  They'll just take your order.
[02:38:02.115 --> 02:38:04.917]  When you tell them what you want, they'll deliver the order to you.
[02:38:05.237 --> 02:38:06.539]  They just want you as a customer.
[02:38:06.599 --> 02:38:07.179]  Great folks.
[02:38:07.199 --> 02:38:07.720]  Give them a call.
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:08.420]  800-686-2237.
[02:38:08.500 --> 02:38:13.244]  And Ted, does this deal go to midnight again?
[02:38:13.465 --> 02:38:14.726]  It goes till midnight tonight.
[02:38:14.766 --> 02:38:17.148]  We'll see what happens tomorrow, so... 800-686-2237.
[02:38:18.609 --> 02:38:20.070]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[02:38:20.831 --> 02:38:21.431]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:38:22.292 --> 02:38:25.515]  They've got some other specials at MidasResources.com, but they won't be that good.
[02:38:25.775 --> 02:38:26.956]  Still great deals across the board.
[02:38:27.256 --> 02:38:28.197]  That number, have you missed it?
[02:38:28.217 --> 02:38:28.437]  800-686-2237.
[02:38:28.718 --> 02:38:31.440]  All right, let's go to Jeremy in Wisconsin.
[02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:32.361]  Jeremy, you're on the air.
[02:38:32.401 --> 02:38:32.701]  Welcome.
[02:38:33.422 --> 02:38:33.762]  Hi, Alex.
[02:38:33.822 --> 02:38:34.162]  How are you?
[02:38:34.543 --> 02:38:34.883]  Good, buddy.
[02:38:35.823 --> 02:38:51.045]  Um, well just recently up here in Milwaukee there's been a lot of police activity in the city which I kind of wanted to bring to attention and some other interesting facts from somebody who had to go to an impact class about how they're going to set up breathalyzer checkpoints in the city.
[02:38:51.485 --> 02:38:52.426]  They've been planning for this.
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:54.380]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:38:54.420 --> 02:38:59.482]  The Feds say just to get you used to checkpoints like the airport, they're going to be in malls everywhere.
[02:38:59.502 --> 02:39:05.544]  And then if you say no to the Fourth Amendment violation, they're going to grab a needle out and start torturing you with it.
[02:39:06.665 --> 02:39:15.408]  And more interesting, the downtown area is where all the restaurants and bars and it's a pretty happening place where college students or whoever live in downtown go.
[02:39:16.970 --> 02:39:24.238]  You want to hurt these bastards, never use their prescription drugs, never use their alcohol, or if you do, do it at home.
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:27.302]  Look, they're the drug peddlers.
[02:39:28.563 --> 02:39:33.687]  And then cops and local governments have always run the whores and the drugs and they only shut down who they don't like.
[02:39:33.987 --> 02:39:34.928]  Don't go down there!
[02:39:34.988 --> 02:39:35.588]  Boycott it!
[02:39:35.608 --> 02:39:36.669]  Say, look you bastards!
[02:39:36.969 --> 02:39:38.390]  Look you stinking parasites!
[02:39:38.751 --> 02:39:40.592]  You go ahead and set up your checkpoints.
[02:39:40.632 --> 02:39:41.573]  We're not going down there.
[02:39:41.613 --> 02:39:41.953]  Go ahead.
[02:39:42.373 --> 02:39:47.337]  Oh yeah, well actually I stopped going down there just because recently some of the favorite places to go
[02:39:48.541 --> 02:39:50.982]  Hey, some of my favorite restaurants are on 6th Street.
[02:39:51.542 --> 02:39:55.444]  I don't go down there, hardly ever, like I used to, even though I don't drink.
[02:39:56.084 --> 02:39:57.004]  Rarely do I drink.
[02:39:57.044 --> 02:40:01.426]  The point is, I don't even go down there because I don't want to be around the steroid cops.
[02:40:01.926 --> 02:40:02.786]  So it can rot!
[02:40:02.926 --> 02:40:03.607]  It can fall!
[02:40:03.927 --> 02:40:04.507]  But they don't care.
[02:40:04.527 --> 02:40:08.268]  They're like, good, we'll just come arrest you for your garage sale, Alex.
[02:40:08.328 --> 02:40:09.269]  We want slaves!
[02:40:10.329 --> 02:40:11.790]  We've legalized slavery again.
[02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:12.590]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:12.850 --> 02:40:17.132]  Well, they're coming right inside all the restaurants and bars and they also have their full dress.
[02:40:17.152 --> 02:40:28.259]  So, in Austin they go in the Radisson Hotel where a guy had three Miller Lights watching the football game, a commuter businessman, and they arrested him when he ordered the third Miller Light in an hour.
[02:40:28.799 --> 02:40:30.880]  I know, they're just, it's total Soviet Union!
[02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:32.441]  It is, it is.
[02:40:32.501 --> 02:40:41.426]  Everyone likes to go for the Packer games, you know, and meet up together and go somewhere, or go to the stadium of Miller Park and go there, but they've been coming into every single place in the city.
[02:40:42.185 --> 02:40:50.292]  I'm trying to warn people that, and I'm trying to get them a little more informed and going to listen to other media outlets such as yours.
[02:40:51.073 --> 02:40:54.837]  But hopefully this, you know, spreading this news around is going to help.
[02:40:55.917 --> 02:40:56.518]  Are you kidding?
[02:40:56.538 --> 02:40:57.259]  You better stop.
[02:40:57.279 --> 02:40:58.780]  The checkpoints there are next.
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:03.745]  The feds are paying them just like they couldn't execute that guy in two hours because it wasn't a doctor?
[02:41:03.765 --> 02:41:06.327]  Because doctors won't kill people because of the Hippocratic Oath?
[02:41:06.867 --> 02:41:08.309]  At that execution you heard about?
[02:41:09.557 --> 02:41:15.502]  The cops, it's admitted, because they've been doing it for 14 years in Arizona, they just start jamming needles in your arms.
[02:41:15.542 --> 02:41:16.944]  It's like it's fun for them.
[02:41:19.606 --> 02:41:19.886]  Sorry.
[02:41:20.827 --> 02:41:30.455]  Just saying, well, the information I got came right from a police officer who teaches the alcohol assessment classes that someone had told me that they have to go see twice a week.
[02:41:31.156 --> 02:41:34.399]  So I imagine that they're actually going to be implementing this pretty soon here.
[02:41:35.496 --> 02:41:40.219]  Yeah, the only answer, the problem is, if you don't drink or do anything, they still make other stuff illegal.
[02:41:40.639 --> 02:41:49.143]  That's why they're making homeschooling illegal, taking care of your neighbor's kids illegal, growing a garden illegal, because they're like, God, we want to arrest these slaves.
[02:41:49.804 --> 02:41:51.204]  Man, we want to beat them over the head.
[02:41:51.785 --> 02:41:52.525]  How do we do it?
[02:41:52.945 --> 02:41:54.066]  We've got to get more money.
[02:41:54.086 --> 02:41:59.609]  See, the big banks set up this system, and the locals suck the money out of you, so they hire thugs to carry it out.
[02:42:00.973 --> 02:42:06.315]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[02:42:06.855 --> 02:42:11.497]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[02:42:11.977 --> 02:42:12.617]  That was then.
[02:42:13.198 --> 02:42:13.838]  This is now.
[02:42:14.498 --> 02:42:16.679]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[02:42:17.199 --> 02:42:22.861]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[02:42:23.261 --> 02:42:32.105]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, unlawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[02:42:32.485 --> 02:42:35.226]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[02:42:35.946 --> 02:42:39.909]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[02:42:40.430 --> 02:42:41.450]  Video never lies.
[02:42:41.931 --> 02:42:43.091]  Watch Big Brother back.

[02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:06.788]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:43:07.268 --> 02:43:14.319]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:43:14.855 --> 02:43:21.059]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:43:21.439 --> 02:43:23.260]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:25.821]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:43:25.922 --> 02:43:36.728]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:43:37.489 --> 02:43:38.771]  It's not about left or right.
[02:43:39.151 --> 02:43:40.612]  It's about a one world government.
[02:43:41.013 --> 02:43:47.360]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:43:56.209 --> 02:43:57.350]  The Obama Deception.
[02:43:57.770 --> 02:43:58.972]  The people strike back.
[02:44:00.919 --> 02:44:02.942]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:44:03.102 --> 02:44:03.903]  Spy on me?
[02:44:03.963 --> 02:44:04.244]  Yeah.
[02:44:04.284 --> 02:44:09.211]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:44:09.331 --> 02:44:10.813]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:44:10.974 --> 02:44:11.615]  Startpage?
[02:44:11.715 --> 02:44:12.055]  Yeah.
[02:44:12.135 --> 02:44:13.117]  Startpage.com.
[02:44:13.237 --> 02:44:15.961]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:44:16.161 --> 02:44:19.885]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[02:44:23.169 --> 02:44:25.552]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:44:25.792 --> 02:44:27.294]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:44:27.394 --> 02:44:27.614]  Right!

[02:45:05.509 --> 02:45:06.950]  Hey, look what a listener sent us.
[02:45:07.991 --> 02:45:09.493]  Freedom is total government.
[02:45:09.973 --> 02:45:11.394]  Freedom is no freedom.
[02:45:11.975 --> 02:45:13.336]  That's what Uncle Sam says.
[02:45:14.277 --> 02:45:14.717]  Look at these.
[02:45:15.338 --> 02:45:21.984]  It says, In Government We Trust, Slavery, 2010, with Obama with a Che Guevara hat on.
[02:45:23.885 --> 02:45:24.746]  You gotta love that.
[02:45:24.786 --> 02:45:29.631]  And there's another one that says, Caution, New World Order Ahead, Potential Hazards Include,
[02:45:31.004 --> 02:45:34.705]  Military draft, World War III, forced vaccinations.
[02:45:35.186 --> 02:45:36.366]  This sign's been out for years.
[02:45:36.406 --> 02:45:37.626]  Now I've noticed it's all happening.
[02:45:38.407 --> 02:45:43.229]  Prison industrial complex, elite-controlled depopulation.
[02:45:45.629 --> 02:45:48.130]  Smart little ideas folks have for getting the word out.
[02:45:48.170 --> 02:45:52.592]  There's my little... I'm glad this is only gold-plated, though, to show how phony it is.
[02:45:52.612 --> 02:45:55.533]  It would be too honorable to make an actual coin of Obama.
[02:45:56.233 --> 02:45:57.194]  North American Union, $1.
[02:45:59.107 --> 02:46:04.851]  No, it is corporate communism where the profits are given to them and we pay for it all.
[02:46:05.191 --> 02:46:07.293]  Let's jam in Shelly in Texas and a few others.
[02:46:07.333 --> 02:46:08.693]  Shelly, you're on the air.
[02:46:08.753 --> 02:46:09.114]  Welcome.
[02:46:10.054 --> 02:46:10.715]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:11.095 --> 02:46:11.535]  Thank you.
[02:46:11.555 --> 02:46:18.040]  I could sit up here for hours with you, but I've got a couple of questions if you can please answer.
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:19.381]  Sure, I'll try.
[02:46:19.781 --> 02:46:24.404]  The last thing I heard you say in regards to the troops that have been deployed to patrol
[02:46:28.038 --> 02:46:30.279]  The streets of the U.S.
[02:46:30.359 --> 02:46:31.019]  was 379,000.
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:36.061]  Is that, are they, where are they moving to?
[02:46:36.161 --> 02:46:39.922]  I'm in Houston, so I'm looking at like, how soon can I expect them here?
[02:46:40.602 --> 02:46:50.005]  And my second question is, my son is four, and I wish I would have, you know, held off and kept him out of school, but I enrolled him in pre-K.
[02:46:50.805 --> 02:46:56.347]  And you know, his teacher even told me that, yeah, they're supposed to call the public officials, but what can I actually do?
[02:46:56.983 --> 02:47:01.105]  As far as taking him out of school and making sure that he doesn't get the vaccine.
[02:47:01.145 --> 02:47:10.089]  Well no, you just say to the health department or to the school nurse, just matter-of-factly or they'll lie because they get money if they get everybody to be vaccinated.
[02:47:10.129 --> 02:47:12.690]  Like 97% is the target number to get the federal funds.
[02:47:12.970 --> 02:47:14.951]  Say, oh yeah, I need that vaccine exemption form.
[02:47:15.811 --> 02:47:18.294]  And they'll try to say, well, why are you exempt?
[02:47:18.634 --> 02:47:19.475]  As if you're dumb.
[02:47:19.735 --> 02:47:23.780]  See, government's all about lying and deceiving and then they've got info you don't have.
[02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:28.865]  You need to just say, listen, it's a civil rights violation for you to not give me that waiver form.
[02:47:29.386 --> 02:47:30.447]  I don't even need the waiver.
[02:47:30.527 --> 02:47:31.848]  It's a waiver for a policy.
[02:47:32.629 --> 02:47:35.832]  And once you have the waiver form, you're fine, you send it in to the health department.
[02:47:36.433 --> 02:47:40.817]  Now they do list you, like Jews had to wear yellow stars, they do put you in a database.
[02:47:41.318 --> 02:47:43.280]  But that's how they'll leave you alone at the school.
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.083]  But the criminals will, in every case we've seen, try to not give it to you.
[02:47:47.384 --> 02:47:48.244]  Proving they're criminals.
[02:47:49.585 --> 02:47:56.110]  But as for troops, all we know is the Pentagon has deployed 40,000 troops in the U.S.
[02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:57.190]  for Brigade Homeland.
[02:47:57.751 --> 02:47:59.912]  First it was 4,000, then it was 20, now it's 40.
[02:48:00.973 --> 02:48:03.234]  A few months ago it was in AP and the Progressive.
[02:48:03.254 --> 02:48:06.296]  It's in the new film, Fall of the Republic.
[02:48:08.914 --> 02:48:27.084]  That they went to the Pentagon, the Pentagon went to Congress and requested, this is in Congressional testimony, the funding for 379,000 troops that they want to deploy over the next year inside the United States to, quote, combat gun owners, veterans, libertarians, you know, they list.
[02:48:28.084 --> 02:48:31.526]  They said threats to the homeland, and then we have the DHS report that lists those.
[02:48:32.007 --> 02:48:34.328]  So, yes, it's really happening.
[02:48:36.278 --> 02:48:44.122]  But first it'll be, oh, we're just out helping at Car Wrecks, oh, we're helping at the sports stadium, oh, we're just out here directing traffic, ma'am.
[02:48:44.683 --> 02:48:47.704]  It's all the condition everybody, including the troops.
[02:48:48.465 --> 02:48:53.227]  And then all the old drunks that, you know, they'll come out and go, what are you, some kind of commie?
[02:48:53.727 --> 02:48:56.609]  You know, they don't care if the troops get their medical care cut.
[02:48:56.889 --> 02:48:58.490]  They don't care if they're dying of vaccines.
[02:48:58.510 --> 02:48:59.710]  They don't really care about the troops.
[02:49:00.011 --> 02:49:04.453]  They just want to get drunk and call on the talk radio and go, shut that Alex Jones up!
[02:49:04.753 --> 02:49:06.395]  We need troops in America!
[02:49:06.595 --> 02:49:08.276]  He hates the military!
[02:49:10.018 --> 02:49:10.919]  God bless you, ma'am.
[02:49:11.139 --> 02:49:12.180]  Anything else, Shelly?
[02:49:13.001 --> 02:49:14.722]  No, thank you for everything you're doing.
[02:49:15.683 --> 02:49:16.143]  Thank you.
[02:49:16.264 --> 02:49:20.608]  Patty, Ken, Nick, you tell them tomorrow that you were on yesterday.
[02:49:20.628 --> 02:49:21.568]  I'll go to the head of the line.
[02:49:21.588 --> 02:49:23.971]  I want to hear what you have to say, but we're out of time right now.
[02:49:25.293 --> 02:49:28.814]  Retransmission, totally jam-packed, coming up right now.
[02:49:28.834 --> 02:49:32.315]  We have the lady on who's told she's not allowed to keep the neighbor kids at the bus stop.
[02:49:32.935 --> 02:49:34.176]  That's coming up in the next hour.
