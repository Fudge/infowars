[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:05.192]  T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:25.507]  Well, he's gonna be with us till about 45 after in the next hour.
[00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:29.029]  And we're gonna have wide open phones next hour for G. Edward Griffin.
[00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.471]  He's a writer and documentary film producer with many successful titles to his credit.
[00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:35.693]  He's listed in Who's Who in America.
[00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:41.256]  He's a well-known because of his talent for researching difficult topics and presenting them in clear terms that all can understand.
[00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:51.269]  He has dealt with such diverse subjects as archaeology and ancient earth history, the Federal Reserve System, international banking, terrorism, internal subversion, the history of taxation, U.S.
[00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.275]  foreign policy, science and politics, cancer therapy, the Supreme Court, and the United Nations.
[00:00:56.295 --> 00:00:57.877]  He's best known for his works include...
[00:00:58.678 --> 00:01:10.441]  The Creature from Jekyll Island, World Without Cancer, The Open Gates of Troy, No Place to Hide, The Capitalist Conspiracy, More Deadly Than War, The Grand Design, The Great Prison Break, and The Fearful Master.
[00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.502]  He's had a long, long, long media history.
[00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:20.543]  What is it, 45 years fighting the New World Order, G. Eber Griffin?
[00:01:21.263 --> 00:01:27.145]  Well, Alex, I think I really was in full armor and on my horse about 1960.
[00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:32.153]  Yeah, definitely 1960.
[00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:34.595]  So we're talking about 49 years.
[00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:35.295]  Yeah.
[00:01:36.977 --> 00:01:38.097]  Well, you've certainly done well.
[00:01:38.138 --> 00:01:39.579]  You're a living icon.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.442]  You know, you're like good wine, though.
[00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:44.222]  You've aged well.
[00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:45.724]  You just get sharper and even better.
[00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:47.745]  Thank you.
[00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:48.186]  I love that.
[00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:49.126]  An icon.
[00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:50.227]  Well, okay.
[00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:51.128]  I have to be something.
[00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:52.089]  Might as well be an icon.
[00:01:53.499 --> 00:02:00.806]  Let me just put a plug in here right now, because you are a big part of Fall of the Republic, and I want to unveil to listeners the new cover.
[00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:08.934]  The first couple of runs we did with the Obama on the cover, and I started thinking, you know, I don't want to make this just about Obama, even though he's their front man.
[00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:12.257]  And so we have the Statue of Liberty plunging down to its destruction.
[00:02:12.677 --> 00:02:14.379]  With Obama down here at the podium.
[00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:19.565]  Fall of the Republic, collector's edition, now available at Infowars.com.
[00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:22.268]  When you order it, this is the cover and the film you'll be getting.
[00:02:22.488 --> 00:02:26.853]  And I gotta say, this latest print, we even did a better res, higher quality encode.
[00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:33.280]  Most people won't notice it, but this is just the most beautiful encode we've ever done on a film.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.201]  It just looks like dynamite.
[00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:41.426]  The information is power-packed, and G. Edward Griffin is a big contributor to Fall of the Republic, so I hope folks will get it today.
[00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:43.387]  Okay, going back to G. Edward Griffin.
[00:02:43.808 --> 00:02:54.076]  G. Edward, I've got so many questions, so many things I want to go over with you today, but the first thing I want to ask you is, 49 years fighting this, publishing best-selling books, really
[00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:58.770]  The name over the last half century.
[00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.797]  You're the person that people point out and say he's he's the icon.
[00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:08.123]  Even if some of the old timers were still alive, you would still be bigger than they are.
[00:03:08.143 --> 00:03:09.444]  And I'm not saying that for ego.
[00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:11.327]  I'm pointing out you have been a
[00:03:12.248 --> 00:03:28.578]  A prime mover, a central force against the globalists, and with a long view of history, if we wouldn't have had you and others 50 years ago fighting and planting seeds and getting laughed at, we wouldn't be having this giant awakening that's blooming today that is really threatening the globalists.
[00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:31.720]  And they admit in their own documents, as you know, that they could lose control.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.463]  That's why they're trying to bum-rush us right now and bring in the entire program and accelerate it.
[00:03:36.903 --> 00:03:43.865]  So people need to understand, it's not going to be an instant victory, and we'll talk about your long view of history and how we can beat these people coming up.
[00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:52.947]  But first, what is it like to see them openly announcing the world government, openly announcing the carbon tax, openly announcing it's going to be the IMF as the world rulers?
[00:03:52.987 --> 00:03:56.548]  We will pay our taxes to private bankers, to Al Gore.
[00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:02.609]  Everything you wrote about 20, 30, 40 years ago, because you were reading their own documents, to now see it
[00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.930]  Well, that's quite an interesting perspective wrapped up in a question there.
[00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.091]  I have to answer your question with a single word.
[00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:08.611]  It feels eerie.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.341]  It's like having a bad nightmare.
[00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:37.162]  You wake up and you say, oh, that was just a nightmare.
[00:04:37.442 --> 00:04:38.682]  Oh, come on, get it out of your mind.
[00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:39.943]  It's just a nightmare.
[00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:40.703]  Repeat after me.
[00:04:40.723 --> 00:04:41.623]  It's just a nightmare.
[00:04:41.923 --> 00:04:49.206]  And then all of a sudden, the events of the nightmare start to unfold before your eyes and you go back and you say, oh, no, it's not a nightmare.
[00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:50.146]  This is reality.
[00:04:50.706 --> 00:04:52.547]  And it's that kind of an eerie feeling.
[00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:58.570]  You could probably write a good movie around that theme, a nightmare that becomes reality.
[00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.451]  But that's really how I feel about it.
[00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:17.459]  You know, when you read the documents of the elitists of the world and you know exactly what they plan and how they think, it is sort of an academic experience in the beginning because you're still living in a system of a lot of freedom and quite a bit of security.
[00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:19.200]  We're good to go.
[00:05:44.498 --> 00:05:45.079]  We're good to go.
[00:06:06.153 --> 00:06:15.321]  The birds are singing, it's a beautiful sunny day, and the water is very calm, and you're moving and enjoying watching the fish jump and all that sort of thing.
[00:06:15.361 --> 00:06:23.527]  But you know, you know because you've looked at the map, you know that you're in a river that's headed toward a huge waterfall.
[00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:29.492]  And you have a pretty good idea that it's down there maybe a couple of days away.
[00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:33.836]  So you're not worried about it now, but you know you've got to get out of that stream of water pretty soon.
[00:06:34.634 --> 00:06:42.396]  And so you're drifting along and everything is fine, but the closer you get to that waterfall, the more rapidly the water seems to move.
[00:06:42.556 --> 00:06:50.878]  And now here we find ourselves with this little rowboat moving quite rapidly, and you can hear the sound, the roar of the water.
[00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:53.038]  You can't see it yet, but you can hear it.
[00:06:53.418 --> 00:06:55.759]  So that's another way of looking at it.
[00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.199]  I'm trying to give you the emotional experience that I have.
[00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:01.000]  It's a very unnerving thing.
[00:07:01.428 --> 00:07:14.475]  Well, I mean, that is a perfect way to describe it, and we've now rounded the bend, and we see the mist and steam rising up from Niagara, and I believe we can now actually see the waterfall.
[00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:16.336]  I mean, they're openly announcing world government.
[00:07:16.997 --> 00:07:22.159]  They're openly announcing carbon taxes, micromanaging our lives, one-child policies.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.884]  Times of London comes out and says, billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation, secret meetings.
[00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:31.471]  I don't
[00:07:50.805 --> 00:07:51.365]  And faster.
[00:07:51.445 --> 00:07:59.967]  And the globalists were denying, they were blaring on loudspeakers from the woods on the sides of the river for decades, that there is no waterfall.
[00:08:00.007 --> 00:08:00.887]  Everything's fine.
[00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.248]  Go to sleep in the rowboat.
[00:08:02.588 --> 00:08:03.168]  Relax.
[00:08:03.228 --> 00:08:03.908]  Drink a beer.
[00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:05.228]  Watch a ball game.
[00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:15.591]  And now as we see the waterfall, and see broken ships at the bottom from history, and tyranny passed, and mass murder passed, and we see all the ghosts of those killed by tyranny,
[00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:21.013]  They're now saying, oh, it is a waterfall, but you're only safe by going over the edge.
[00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:23.153]  Global government is the solution.
[00:08:23.173 --> 00:08:24.414]  G. Eber Griffin.
[00:08:25.034 --> 00:08:27.295]  Well, I think you said it so well, as usual, Alex.
[00:08:27.315 --> 00:08:31.436]  Yeah, they're saying, look, if you stay where you are, you're going to be dashed against a rock.
[00:08:31.937 --> 00:08:34.077]  So therefore, go over the waterfall.
[00:08:34.217 --> 00:08:34.858]  Come with us.
[00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.278]  We will lead you over the waterfall.
[00:08:36.478 --> 00:08:39.739]  There's a nice big lake down there and it'll be all calm again.
[00:08:41.926 --> 00:08:53.770]  The beginning of the video that you produced, that magnificent video, The Fall of the Republic, you've got a speech by Obama in which he's talking about the need for change.
[00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:59.732]  It's kind of his campaign rhetoric, but re-wrapped up in post-presidential events.
[00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.931]  That's right.
[00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:25.537]  But to any informed observer, that's the biggest laugh of all, because that is exactly what the present administration is doing.
[00:09:25.777 --> 00:09:30.059]  They are continuing what they were doing, except they're accelerating it somewhat.
[00:09:30.499 --> 00:09:31.860]  So there's no change in direction.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.041]  It's always headed toward that waterfall.
[00:09:34.101 --> 00:09:35.261]  And yes, you're quite right.
[00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:38.403]  They're saying you've got to go over the waterfall because you can't stay where you are.
[00:09:38.843 --> 00:09:41.504]  Well, that's not much of a choice, is it?
[00:09:43.536 --> 00:09:44.196]  No, it's not.
[00:09:44.356 --> 00:09:46.497]  And on both sides of us are the Republic.
[00:09:47.117 --> 00:09:48.917]  Beautiful fields, forests.
[00:09:49.217 --> 00:09:53.618]  You know, we could build our civilization back if we had the engine of liberty.
[00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:57.119]  But instead, they're saying, oh no, don't get out of the boat.
[00:09:57.239 --> 00:09:59.060]  Just keep going over the waterfall.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.140]  Everything is going to be fine.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.401]  But we know it's not going to be fine.
[00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:07.042]  We know that's a thousand foot drop down to those rocks below.
[00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:11.803]  We know that hundreds of other civilizations have gone over these falls, haven't they?
[00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:24.911]  Oh yes they have, and I guess it's time to abandon the analogy, because actually the people who are calling the shots today, they don't like the rowboat we're in.
[00:10:25.512 --> 00:10:32.877]  That rowboat provides way too much stability for people in them, and they really want that rowboat destroyed.
[00:10:33.647 --> 00:10:46.355]  They want the people in the water, they want the people clamoring for life rings or, you know, lifesavers that the government will throw out to them because they want the people out of those boats and into the water.
[00:10:47.075 --> 00:10:48.516]  And that's the reality.
[00:10:48.576 --> 00:10:49.677]  Because they're sharks!
[00:10:49.837 --> 00:10:52.799]  The banks, in their own documents, want vertical integration.
[00:10:53.079 --> 00:11:00.804]  As Maury Strong said, they want to wreck the economy so we all go on collectivist welfare so they can call the shots on everything.
[00:11:01.497 --> 00:11:01.937]  Exactly.
[00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:07.139]  They're power freaks, and that's how they get their jollies, and that's it.
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.780]  They're the only trick they know.
[00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:10.861]  They're collectivists.
[00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:19.325]  They believe in that ideology of collectivism with all-powerful government at the top and people serving the state at the bottom.
[00:11:19.905 --> 00:11:29.689]  And that's just fine with them because they know that they're in the structure either at the top or far enough toward the top to have a very comfortable life.
[00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:32.371]  While the rest of us are servants.
[00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:34.412]  So it's as simple as that.
[00:11:34.732 --> 00:11:39.796]  And the trouble is with most Americans, they can't imagine that there are people out there with that kind of a vision.
[00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:41.517]  Because it's not their vision.
[00:11:41.557 --> 00:11:44.379]  They think there is no one that actually wants to rule the world.
[00:11:44.739 --> 00:11:45.640]  But they're so wrong.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.222]  History shows that elites always want to rule the world.
[00:11:49.242 --> 00:11:50.283]  They always dominate.
[00:11:50.303 --> 00:11:51.384]  They always enslave.
[00:11:51.424 --> 00:11:57.408]  But somehow this psychological idea got implanted that corruption doesn't exist in government.
[00:11:58.795 --> 00:12:05.964]  Friends, this is Big Jim Farmer urging you to go to ejseed.com and purchase the Big Seed Bank.
[00:12:06.324 --> 00:12:12.832]  It contains 35 varieties of heirloom seeds that will provide you and your family delicious vegetables for years.
[00:12:13.953 --> 00:12:14.814]  No GMOs.
[00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:37.717]  We're good to go.
[00:12:58.669 --> 00:13:00.690]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:01.631]  Spy on me?
[00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:01.991]  Yeah.
[00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:06.935]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:08.556]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:13:08.716 --> 00:13:09.357]  Startpage?
[00:13:09.457 --> 00:13:09.797]  Yeah.
[00:13:09.857 --> 00:13:10.858]  Startpage.com.
[00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.780]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.643]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:13:17.803 --> 00:13:20.605]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.267]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:13:23.547 --> 00:13:25.029]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.369]  Right!

[00:13:28.752 --> 00:13:29.292]  Hello, folks.
[00:13:29.332 --> 00:13:30.293]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:13:30.673 --> 00:13:34.196]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:13:34.537 --> 00:13:38.160]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.412]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.

[00:13:52.925 --> 00:13:54.529]  That's StartPage.com
[00:13:58.493 --> 00:14:04.696]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:14:05.157 --> 00:14:12.921]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:21.145]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:14:21.445 --> 00:14:26.188]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:14:26.528 --> 00:14:31.234]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:14:31.754 --> 00:14:35.598]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:14:36.099 --> 00:14:37.120]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.225]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:01.393]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride.
[00:16:10.441 --> 00:16:34.421]  With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five But I am still alive
[00:16:35.552 --> 00:16:37.554]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[00:16:37.654 --> 00:16:39.455]  Short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:41.417]  We're going to break down what's happening currently.
[00:16:41.457 --> 00:16:58.870]  But G. Edward, in this brief five-minute segment, can you give people an overview of, say, Norman Dodd and the Reese Committee, the Church Committee, Carol Quigley, documents from the elite, similar to more modern ones like Ecoscience, written by the White House Science Czar, where they admit planetary government.
[00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:05.095]  And then now Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General two weeks ago, editorial in the New York Times titled, We Can Do It.
[00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:10.457]  Saying, global government is here, and it's going to be funded by carbon taxes.
[00:17:10.477 --> 00:17:15.120]  We'll talk about that coming up, but a few founding documents for people that want to do research.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.842]  Yeah, I think it's important to get as close to the roots of this as possible.
[00:17:19.882 --> 00:17:25.705]  Of course, you can go back practically to Adam and Eve if you want to, but you don't need to go that far.
[00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:32.228]  One of the most eye-opening documents that I discovered early in my research, Alex, was
[00:17:33.139 --> 00:17:36.281]  The testimony of a fellow by the name of Norman Dodd.
[00:17:37.021 --> 00:17:42.824]  Norman Dodd, this was the 1940s, right after the end of World War II.
[00:17:43.344 --> 00:17:51.548]  There was a lot of concern among a lot of Americans, and particularly some newspaper editors.
[00:17:51.588 --> 00:18:01.633]  The Hearst newspaper chain, in particular, was very concerned in writing editorials about the tax-exempt foundations in America.
[00:18:02.427 --> 00:18:08.212]  Obviously, promoting what was, in those days, blatant communist propaganda.
[00:18:09.813 --> 00:18:18.940]  I found that hard to believe when I read those editorials, but I went to the documents themselves from the tax-exempt foundations, and lo and behold, they were right.
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.043]  They were publishing essays written by, guess who?
[00:18:23.203 --> 00:18:24.064]  Joseph Stalin.
[00:18:24.861 --> 00:18:26.502]  We're good to go.
[00:18:42.408 --> 00:18:48.010]  And it was just amazing, because it was hard for me to believe that would happen, but there it was in the historical record.
[00:18:48.371 --> 00:19:01.296]  And so the Hearst papers and others, a lot of newspapers around the country, were writing editorials exposing this, and of course that triggered a lot of alarm on the part of the American people, and they wanted their government
[00:19:01.934 --> 00:19:19.809]  People in those days, like today, still thought that their government represented them, and so they wanted their government to investigate this, not realizing that already, even in those days, our own government was being heavily influenced by tax-exempt foundations and the financial interests that supported them.
[00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:28.717]  But anyway, the idea was that they wanted an investigation of these tax-exempt foundations to see if they were, in fact, un-American, is the word they used.
[00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:39.940]  That they were advocating systems that required the destruction of the American way of life, and using a process that was not constitutional.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:48.584]  I mean, the American system is designed to be changed if necessary, and if it's the will of the people, but there's a constitutional path for that change.
[00:19:49.044 --> 00:19:55.687]  And so they were concerned about groups such as the Communist Party in those days pursuing an unconstitutional path.
[00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:56.607]  Well, that's just background.
[00:19:56.887 --> 00:20:00.628]  They hired a fellow by the name of Norman Dodd to be their chief investigator
[00:20:25.672 --> 00:20:30.454]  And Norman Dodd came from banking circles, actually.
[00:20:30.474 --> 00:20:36.356]  He had worked for some of the largest banks of New York.
[00:20:36.716 --> 00:20:41.397]  He knew how the power structure worked and all of that, and he was not very happy with it, as a matter of fact.
[00:20:41.718 --> 00:20:42.798]  He had left banking.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:49.723]  And, well, we won't go through his career, but eventually they did select him to be the chief investigator.
[00:20:49.763 --> 00:21:08.273]  So now we finally get to the Norman Dodd testimony, which I ran across, oh, I guess in the middle 1960s when I was researching a lot of the government documents put out by the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.
[00:21:08.777 --> 00:21:20.901]  And one of those obscure documents, and believe me, I had stacks of these things that probably, if they were all put on top of each other, would probably go eight feet to the ceiling of the house here.
[00:21:21.361 --> 00:21:28.363]  And one of those obscure documents I ran across, the testimony of Norman Dodd, and it almost knocked my socks off.
[00:21:29.223 --> 00:21:45.011]  He was basically saying that when he investigated these tax-exempt foundations, he found out that there was nestled inside of them literally a cabal of people, very powerful, wealthy people, who are trying to destroy America.
[00:21:45.411 --> 00:21:45.871]  Stay there.
[00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:46.692]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:49.733]  We're on the march.
[00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:51.814]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:52.755 --> 00:21:55.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:57.878 --> 00:22:01.861]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.

[00:22:57.571 --> 00:23:01.813]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:06.196]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:06.456 --> 00:23:11.879]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:12.219 --> 00:23:12.659]  It's true.
[00:23:12.959 --> 00:23:17.502]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:17.822 --> 00:23:18.363]  Number 3.
[00:23:18.643 --> 00:23:21.946]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:23:22.246 --> 00:23:25.969]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.710]  Number 4.
[00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.332]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:23:29.712 --> 00:23:33.115]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:33.395 --> 00:23:33.596]  Number 5.
[00:23:34.176 --> 00:23:38.100]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.085]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.711]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:36.334]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:24:36.614 --> 00:24:40.978]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.

[00:24:50.067 --> 00:24:52.189]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:25:05.435 --> 00:25:08.978]  I want to tell you about a couple of our sponsors, and we're going right back to G. Edward Griffin.
[00:25:11.379 --> 00:25:12.761]  He's really an archaeologist.
[00:25:14.061 --> 00:25:23.208]  Going back into the Congressional record, going into the Foundation's own records, and showing you the embryonic development of what has grown into this monster today.
[00:25:23.749 --> 00:25:24.930]  That's coming up in one moment.
[00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.652]  I want to tell you about EcuadorCentral.com.
[00:25:27.672 --> 00:25:28.813]  You know the country Ecuador?
[00:25:28.913 --> 00:25:30.134]  EcuadorCentral.com.
[00:25:30.814 --> 00:25:33.858]  It's your duty to know every option you have to protect you and your family.
[00:25:34.178 --> 00:25:38.523]  Whether you're looking for a rental property, a new start, or you just want to know your options.
[00:25:38.924 --> 00:25:41.026]  I urge you to go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[00:25:41.046 --> 00:25:42.167]  The website is great.
[00:25:42.668 --> 00:25:46.192]  I will give you all the information you want to know before you go.
[00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:48.595]  They will give it to you at EcuadorCentral.com.
[00:25:48.655 --> 00:25:50.577]  Go there and see what folks are doing.
[00:25:51.178 --> 00:25:56.324]  Whether you are interested in real estate investment, travel, or just want to see pictures and videos, go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[00:25:56.684 --> 00:25:59.507]  That's EcuadorCentral.com.
[00:26:00.088 --> 00:26:01.970]  Also, MySolarBackup.com.
[00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.732]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:05.054]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[00:26:05.574 --> 00:26:07.416]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid.
[00:26:08.197 --> 00:26:09.498]  And here's a good way to do just that.
[00:26:09.918 --> 00:26:14.102]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[00:26:14.122 --> 00:26:22.189]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source 800 watt generator and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:28.574]  Remember too that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[00:26:28.974 --> 00:26:31.095]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[00:26:31.415 --> 00:26:33.897]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move now.
[00:26:34.177 --> 00:26:35.618]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:26:35.638 --> 00:26:36.999]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:41.681]  Or give them a call toll-free at 877-327-0365.
[00:26:41.761 --> 00:26:43.442]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:26:43.983 --> 00:26:50.346]  Okay, G. Edward, you're getting into the REIS Committee, reading the testimony of Norman Dodd, this high-powered investigator hired by Congress.
[00:26:50.927 --> 00:26:52.908]  You have the actual foundation documents.
[00:26:53.348 --> 00:26:58.090]  That we know of as the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, later the Ford Foundation.
[00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.491]  They're now quite public about all this.
[00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:03.092]  And I want you to go through the testimony first and then into modern times.
[00:27:03.132 --> 00:27:05.213]  But here's a microcosm example.
[00:27:06.453 --> 00:27:08.394]  Eco-barons lead the way.
[00:27:08.754 --> 00:27:09.975]  Times of London today.
[00:27:10.888 --> 00:27:11.068]  I think?
[00:27:28.602 --> 00:27:35.744]  You know, things that sound reasonable, but when you actually read the minutes of these meetings that have been covered by the media, it's population control.
[00:27:35.824 --> 00:27:37.264]  How do we shut off the resources?
[00:27:37.304 --> 00:27:39.645]  How do we destroy the industrial society?
[00:27:39.705 --> 00:27:44.166]  How do we bring back a neo-feudal type of serfdom to control everyone?
[00:27:44.586 --> 00:27:45.866]  And here's another Times of London.
[00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:48.847]  Billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation.
[00:27:48.887 --> 00:27:55.709]  America's rich people, richest people, meet to discuss ways of tackling disastrous environmental, social, and industrial threats.
[00:27:55.749 --> 00:27:56.689]  And at the end of the article,
[00:27:57.489 --> 00:28:02.671]  It says the Rockefeller Foundation put it on at Rockefeller University.
[00:28:03.071 --> 00:28:05.751]  It was secret, but they told the Times some of what happened.
[00:28:06.392 --> 00:28:07.952]  And they said, why all the secrecy?
[00:28:08.032 --> 00:28:18.255]  They wanted to speak rich to rich without worrying anything they could and said would end up in the newspapers, painting them as an alternative world government, he said.
[00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:20.816]  Because this meeting went on a week before Bilderberg this year.
[00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:36.727]  Now, you then see the Rockefeller Foundation as the nexus, or the directorship, and you're the expert on this, I'm just telling the listeners about it, of all the new carbon tax laws, where they decide who can have a business, where they decide what gets developed, what governments fund.
[00:28:37.167 --> 00:28:45.153]  This is the private banking cartel, through government power, in a tyrannical fashion, taking complete control over society.
[00:28:45.373 --> 00:28:46.014]  Please continue.
[00:28:47.073 --> 00:29:06.178]  Yes, well, boy, there's so much on that, and it all, as you said earlier, it goes back to the earliest beginnings, of which I'm aware, where they actually talked about these strategies was when the tax-exempt foundations amassed tremendous amounts of financial firepower.
[00:29:06.638 --> 00:29:13.620]  We were talking about, as you mentioned, the Carnegie Endowment Fund for International Peace, the Rockefeller Foundation Fund, the Ford Foundation.
[00:29:14.162 --> 00:29:14.563]  I think.
[00:29:26.052 --> 00:29:27.773]  You know, constant flow of money.
[00:29:27.813 --> 00:29:33.154]  And they use it, the general impression is that they use it for philanthropic purposes.
[00:29:33.714 --> 00:29:53.640]  But now we're talking about Norman Dodd, who started to investigate these organizations and found out that under the name of, or the cover of, philanthropy, they were actually doing social engineering, and they were doing a government change, and they were trying to change the actual, the characteristic of the American society.
[00:29:54.441 --> 00:29:56.222]  And it was quite astounding.
[00:29:56.902 --> 00:30:04.065]  And when I read this testimony, I just found it almost, almost impossible to believe.
[00:30:04.685 --> 00:30:16.510]  And so I was traveling in those days back to Virginia, and we had hired a television crew and we were putting together a little documentary on some topic.
[00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:17.691]  It wasn't this at all.
[00:30:18.151 --> 00:30:20.252]  I've even forgotten the topic at the present time.
[00:30:20.808 --> 00:30:26.471]  But I do know that we had a weekend where we had no appointments and no interviews.
[00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:36.035]  And so I decided to see if I could locate Norman Dodd, because I knew the last reference I had, they said he lived in Virginia someplace.
[00:30:36.555 --> 00:30:42.758]  And so I just opened up the telephone directory and started to look through to see if I could find how many Norman Dodds there were.
[00:30:42.798 --> 00:30:43.718]  There were only about three.
[00:30:46.087 --> 00:30:50.031]  So I decided to call the first one on the list, and it was him!
[00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:52.113]  It was almost incredible.
[00:30:52.473 --> 00:30:52.893]  Good luck.
[00:30:52.973 --> 00:30:54.495]  I said, Mr. Dodd, are you the same one?
[00:30:55.535 --> 00:30:57.397]  Was the investigator for the Reese Committee.
[00:30:57.417 --> 00:31:01.481]  He said, yes, that is I. And I said, well, how wonderful.
[00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:02.141]  I'm here.
[00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:05.544]  I have a camera crew and I'm interested in your testimony.
[00:31:05.604 --> 00:31:07.666]  Would you like to speak for our cameras?
[00:31:07.706 --> 00:31:09.608]  He said, well, of course, young man, of course.
[00:31:09.628 --> 00:31:10.669]  It was many years ago.
[00:31:11.209 --> 00:31:18.236]  And so we got him over to where we were staying and I actually captured his whole story on videotape.
[00:31:18.972 --> 00:31:28.960]  And it was a good thing, because by that time he was advanced in years, and he was not very well at all, and it wasn't, I think it was less than a year later that he passed away.
[00:31:29.461 --> 00:31:36.006]  So we were fortunate enough to get his testimony, again this time, spoken to our cameras.
[00:31:36.486 --> 00:31:41.690]  And I had a chance to question him, so I became very, very personally familiar with his story.
[00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:45.894]  And I might say that if anybody is interested in this, you can find
[00:31:46.849 --> 00:31:59.191]  The complete description of what he said, and you can find even a reference to the film, the documentary film which we produced based on his testimony, which is called The Hidden Agenda.
[00:31:59.932 --> 00:32:01.852]  And you can find all of that on our website.
[00:32:02.192 --> 00:32:09.193]  In fact, if we're talking about documents, I think a good reference point would be to come to the Freedom Force website.
[00:32:09.213 --> 00:32:11.774]  That's freedomforceinternational.org.
[00:32:13.386 --> 00:32:19.788]  And when you get there to the landing page, you'll see across the top a subsection called The Issues.
[00:32:20.528 --> 00:32:34.613]  And if you'll just navigate to The Issues, at the bottom of that page you'll see a series of essays and references which include almost all of the documents that we're talking about, Alex, including the Norman Dodd testimony.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:42.387]  Absolutely, and people can also Google Norman Dodd and the video is out on the web, but it's all the key info is there at the Freedom Force website.
[00:32:42.407 --> 00:32:45.229]  We'll give that all out before you leave us again as well.
[00:32:46.243 --> 00:32:53.326]  We also have Carol Quigley, and I want to speak some about that and then get into what's currently happening as we come down to the end game.
[00:32:53.866 --> 00:33:01.029]  And suddenly they go from denying their plans that they were building behind the curtains, now they're launching this warmock, this juggernaut against us.
[00:33:01.069 --> 00:33:10.933]  So they've unveiled it and they are pushing it and telling everybody how great it is and how wonderful it is and how fantastic it is.
[00:33:13.274 --> 00:33:18.599]  So let's discuss terms here because we start talking about a communist conspiracy.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.984]  People think it's a bunch of guys in black uniforms running around in Russia a hundred years ago.
[00:33:24.385 --> 00:33:36.937]  Can you explain to people why the ultra-rich always fund wealth transferring programs and always bill it and paint it and package it as if it's a revolution of the people and why ultra-rich
[00:33:38.118 --> 00:33:41.322]  Yeah, it's really looking at the wrong place if you're asking why the super-rich
[00:34:00.203 --> 00:34:02.946]  Our collectivists gravitate into government.
[00:34:03.507 --> 00:34:09.133]  The rich aspect of their characteristics is not the main thing.
[00:34:09.433 --> 00:34:10.914]  It's their power mad people.
[00:34:11.395 --> 00:34:14.859]  And money is one of the most important levers of power.
[00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:22.427]  And so power mad people, these control freaks, the predator class, different ways of saying the same thing,
[00:34:23.547 --> 00:34:26.868]  They will gravitate toward any mechanism of power.
[00:34:26.928 --> 00:34:28.409]  Well, that's government, isn't it?
[00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:35.631]  If you can control the levers of governmental power, you can really control the population and you can have all the money.
[00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:38.511]  So it's kind of a merger.
[00:34:39.052 --> 00:34:44.073]  And they can pretend to be collectivists on the left or collectivists on the right.
[00:34:44.113 --> 00:34:45.133]  It makes no difference.
[00:34:45.754 --> 00:34:50.675]  Right and left wings are merely two wings of the same ugly bird, which is collectivism.
[00:34:51.315 --> 00:34:56.461]  And like any wings on a bird, they'll flap against each other in order to fly.
[00:34:56.481 --> 00:35:01.266]  You need both wings to fly, and so this is the appearance of conflict.
[00:35:02.067 --> 00:35:12.578]  So that, politically speaking, all the dum-dums down at the bottom of this mechanism think that they're, you know, participating in their own political destiny.
[00:35:13.178 --> 00:35:18.379]  Because they can go to the polls and they can vote the rascals out and vote Republican this time.
[00:35:18.399 --> 00:35:19.460]  Oh, we don't like that.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.640]  We'll go vote Democrat the next time.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.461]  And the two wings beat against each other and the bird flies.
[00:35:26.282 --> 00:35:30.203]  And so that's true not only in our country, but it's true around the world.
[00:35:30.563 --> 00:35:38.385]  And it's true through much of modern history that the conflict, that the big major conflicts of the world, of which we're familiar, World War I,
[00:35:39.145 --> 00:35:42.687]  Okay, we had our customary phone drop, so we're going to get G. Edward Griffin back on.
[00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:44.028]  In fact, let's just have Genesis do it.
[00:35:44.088 --> 00:35:47.310]  Give Genesis his phone number, and we'll just go with the Genesis phone system.
[00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:24.879]  And while we're getting G. Edward Griffin back on the line, again, I'll just point out that he is in the film Fall of the Republic.
[00:36:25.933 --> 00:36:27.996]  Follow the Republic, America's last stand.
[00:36:28.216 --> 00:36:29.719]  Make the choice liberty or tyranny.
[00:36:29.779 --> 00:36:33.965]  Follow the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the U.S.
[00:36:34.005 --> 00:36:34.946]  economy by design.
[00:36:35.387 --> 00:36:40.795]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[00:36:41.636 --> 00:36:45.818]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:36:45.858 --> 00:36:51.180]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.680]  President to chair the world body.
[00:36:53.281 --> 00:37:00.943]  A sign of a dictatorship is in its final stages of completion, and laws protecting basic human rights are now being abolished worldwide.
[00:37:00.963 --> 00:37:03.825]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[00:37:04.345 --> 00:37:06.886]  A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite.
[00:37:07.706 --> 00:37:14.409]  Uh, is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.
[00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.951]  The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world's savior.
[00:37:18.411 --> 00:37:24.134]  He is the Trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.
[00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:29.677]  The film reveals the architecture of the New World Order and what the power elite have in store for humanity.
[00:37:30.097 --> 00:37:33.819]  More importantly, it communicates how we the people can retake our government,
[00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:36.523]  Turn the criminal tide and bring the tyrants to justice.
[00:37:36.804 --> 00:37:40.490]  Fall of the Republic, available on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:37:40.911 --> 00:37:44.417]  Okay, going back to G. Edward Griffin, our line dropped to you.
[00:37:45.199 --> 00:37:46.882]  Continue where you left off, sir.
[00:37:47.389 --> 00:37:48.950]  Yeah, I don't know what happened.
[00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:50.751]  All of a sudden I was talking to a dead phone.
[00:37:50.792 --> 00:38:02.320]  But anyway, it was probably the universe speaking to me, because I realized I was digressing from your initial question, which is, why do these people always gravitate toward government?
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.544]  And the word that was used was the super-rich, or the very rich.
[00:38:07.824 --> 00:38:14.228]  Well, actually, you know, in the beginning of this country, America surpassed the rest of the world through
[00:38:15.289 --> 00:38:16.710]  A very simple principle.
[00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.731]  It's called free enterprise competition.
[00:38:19.451 --> 00:38:22.333]  And under those conditions, people compete.
[00:38:22.953 --> 00:38:27.215]  They produce the best product and service they possibly can at the lowest possible price.
[00:38:27.856 --> 00:38:32.878]  And this leads to great systems of efficiency and productivity.
[00:38:32.938 --> 00:38:36.240]  And that, in my view, is what made America so great.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.422]  Because we came from a virtual wilderness.
[00:38:39.983 --> 00:38:40.344]  I don't know.
[00:38:50.762 --> 00:39:07.874]  These very wealthy people, who had become the captains of industry, as they like to call them, you know, the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and so forth, had already reached great fortunes, acquired great fortunes, and decided that competition was no longer in their best interest.
[00:39:08.274 --> 00:39:11.256]  And they began to look for ways to eliminate competition.
[00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:14.738]  In fact, John D. Rockefeller said it best.
[00:39:15.238 --> 00:39:17.260]  He's quoted by all of his biographers.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.782]  He said, competition is a sin.
[00:39:20.322 --> 00:39:26.466]  Well, of course it's a sin if you're at the top of the pyramid and you don't want anybody competing with you because you're already in first place.
[00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:29.168]  Then you say competition is a sin.
[00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:39.430]  And from that period of history, about the 1880s on, there was a rather substantial and rapid change in the way Americans did business.
[00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:58.494]  Instead of free enterprise competition, they began to coalesce into cartels and form monopolies, and to go into partnership with government to pass laws, always in the name of protecting the people, but laws which in reality eliminated competition.
[00:39:58.834 --> 00:39:59.335]  I think so.
[00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.951]  And so we saw a change in the way people became rich.
[00:40:10.431 --> 00:40:14.513]  It used to be they became rich by competing and by producing goods and services.
[00:40:14.833 --> 00:40:31.398]  And then by the 1900s, they became rich by not competing and instead using their prowess and their expertise to buy politicians, to create laws that would eliminate their competition and give them unfair advantage.
[00:40:31.818 --> 00:40:42.066]  And that's how we see the big bankers publicly funding fascism and communism, now declassified that Hitler and Mussolini were MI5 and were basically set up.
[00:40:42.626 --> 00:40:52.934]  I mean, this is the sophistication of the Milner Group and this British model, this imperial model of hiding your true government behind front men.
[00:40:53.895 --> 00:41:03.246]  And so elites can come in and have the government give them the power to issue currency and credit and buy up the planet, but still some people don't want to sell.
[00:41:03.606 --> 00:41:11.735]  So now you pass big environmental laws, which the Rockefellers admit they founded, which they also founded the worldwide acceptance of eugenics.
[00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:15.937]  Over a hundred years ago, as you know, the rock stars were scientists.
[00:41:16.298 --> 00:41:17.498]  And these elites were smart.
[00:41:17.558 --> 00:41:19.139]  They financed most of the scientists.
[00:41:19.559 --> 00:41:34.425]  And they said, come up with systems of social control to divide and conquer people, to dumb them down, to take over government, to centralize control, to take over education, to render the public weak and impotent against us.
[00:41:34.885 --> 00:41:39.647]  As Bertrand Russell said, through social engineering, that the elite finance, in his own words,
[00:41:40.447 --> 00:41:51.975]  A rebellion by the lower classes, or the proles, as he called it, he was using communist terminology, though he worked for the big money banks and was MI6 himself, and OSS before that, Nobel Prize winner.
[00:41:52.415 --> 00:42:03.763]  He said, a rebellion by the proles will be as unthinkable as a rebellion of sheep against the practice of eating mutton, or sheep is what mutton means for those that don't know.
[00:42:04.083 --> 00:42:10.047]  So they're saying we're blind, dumb sheep, that sheep don't rebel against their owner when they're getting slaughtered, do they G. Edward?
[00:42:10.547 --> 00:42:39.601]  Well, no, and cattle don't, and a lot of all those domesticated animals don't, and now we're back to Norman Dodd, because what he discovered when he was talking with the heads of these tax-exempt foundations is that they were laying a master plan which was, had as its goal, how to make the population of America docile, like cattle and sheep, and how to get them to accept all of these things without complaining, and the strategy they came up with was
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:41.700]  Stay there.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:48.908]  We're going to talk about that strategy on the other side, then bring it forward to current times and then the future with G. Edward Griffin.
[00:42:49.308 --> 00:42:50.169]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:42:50.229 --> 00:42:52.111]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:42:58.217 --> 00:42:59.598]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:43:00.179 --> 00:43:02.681]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:43:03.658 --> 00:43:16.369]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to Fluscam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:28.701]  Learn why Barack Obama's Science R recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:32.102]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:43:32.582 --> 00:43:39.545]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family, it has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[00:43:59.381 --> 00:44:03.027]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:03.408 --> 00:44:06.413]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:06.653 --> 00:44:08.076]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:44:08.783 --> 00:44:11.425]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:11.445 --> 00:44:17.689]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:17.849 --> 00:44:22.873]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:23.033 --> 00:44:33.020]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.241]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:35.482 --> 00:44:36.782]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:37.063 --> 00:44:39.344]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:39.524 --> 00:44:41.386]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:41.646 --> 00:44:46.469]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:45:02.476 --> 00:45:03.217]  Get a pencil.
[00:45:03.457 --> 00:45:06.239]  Discover how to turn $10,000 into possibly $431,000 in the next 12 to 18 months.
[00:45:06.519 --> 00:45:10.101]  For example, investors who took Scott Smith's advice and invested $10,000 in Silver Standard Resources turned it into $431,000.
[00:45:10.241 --> 00:45:13.003]  And those who invested in Seabridge Gold Shares turned $10,000 into $800,000.
[00:45:26.232 --> 00:45:32.596]  Scott Smith is the former senior executive of Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential, an investment newsletter.
[00:45:33.036 --> 00:45:38.679]  He's urging everyone afraid of the nearly $2 trillion in new debt to get his inflation survival kit.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:43.422]  It details seven must-own stocks, including a gold stock with six-figure
[00:45:45.948 --> 00:45:46.469]  Federal agents!
[00:45:46.529 --> 00:45:47.110]  We are armed!
[00:46:01.219 --> 00:46:05.423]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:46:05.443 --> 00:46:08.106]  Would you stand up for truth?
[00:46:08.246 --> 00:46:10.688]  Or would you turn away too?
[00:46:10.848 --> 00:46:16.133]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[00:46:16.634 --> 00:46:18.616]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:46:19.416 --> 00:46:25.559]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest with us until about 45 minutes into the next hour.
[00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:45.947]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[00:46:46.447 --> 00:46:48.789]  Okay, G. Edward, you got to the point of domestication.
[00:46:48.989 --> 00:47:09.222]  And literally, we have hundreds of textbooks, thousands of white papers, congressional reports, the foundations themselves, scientific dictatorship, global government, to carry out a global police state, that's their quotes, to force one-child policy, sterilization, eugenics, mainstream news reporting, the elite are obsessed with this.
[00:47:10.734 --> 00:47:12.315]  These are very, very greedy people.
[00:47:12.535 --> 00:47:14.397]  They want the life extension technologies.
[00:47:14.437 --> 00:47:16.218]  They want the cancer cures for themselves.
[00:47:16.658 --> 00:47:17.939]  They want total control.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.080]  They want it now.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:25.605]  So now Al Gore admits his new movies about how it's a religion, how the environment's a religion.
[00:47:25.645 --> 00:47:27.586]  They always plan to have the UN religion.
[00:47:27.906 --> 00:47:29.267]  It's all now happening.
[00:47:29.307 --> 00:47:29.928]  Please continue.
[00:47:30.697 --> 00:47:35.679]  Well, yes, and just before the break, we were talking about the strategy, the fact that this is not an accident.
[00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:37.560]  This is not new.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:44.762]  The foundation for this was laid in strategic form, well, at the turn of the last century.
[00:47:44.822 --> 00:47:46.583]  But we were talking about Norman Dodd.
[00:47:46.603 --> 00:47:51.305]  I keep coming back to him because I think there's so much to be learned from his testimony.
[00:47:51.325 --> 00:47:59.288]  And basically, when he went in, he talked to the head of the Ford Foundation, a guy by the name of Gaither, I think was his name.
[00:47:59.901 --> 00:48:00.001]  And
[00:48:16.505 --> 00:48:25.914]  Putting our resources to work so as to change the United States of America so it can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union.
[00:48:26.115 --> 00:48:27.556]  Those were his exact words.
[00:48:28.137 --> 00:48:30.980]  And Dodd said he almost fell off of his chair when he heard that.
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.242]  And he said it wasn't just the Soviet Union.
[00:48:33.282 --> 00:48:33.802]  It wasn't that.
[00:48:34.043 --> 00:48:35.524]  It was communism that they wanted.
[00:48:35.584 --> 00:48:38.347]  But the fact was, if you could merge the United States
[00:48:38.647 --> 00:48:39.127]  We're good.
[00:48:59.916 --> 00:49:01.559]  He said, well, how can you do that?
[00:49:01.979 --> 00:49:09.530]  And he got the answer when he visited the offices of the Carnegie Endowment Fund for International Peace.
[00:49:11.842 --> 00:49:19.610]  You can take a look at our Minute Books and you can see what we do here and the answer came, here's the answer, the strategy that I'm finally building to.
[00:49:20.071 --> 00:49:29.881]  They said the American people will never surrender their affinity to their legal system, their customs, their traditions, you know, none of that.
[00:49:29.961 --> 00:49:34.586]  The people in America are different and they'll never give up any of that unless
[00:49:35.635 --> 00:49:38.299]  Unless they're frightened into it.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.306]  If they thought that it was necessary in order to survive.
[00:49:43.044 --> 00:49:48.827]  Then they will give up everything because survival is the most basic instinct of all human beings.
[00:49:48.887 --> 00:50:02.453]  And so therefore, if you're going to change life in the United States so it can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union and any other totalitarian system in the world, you must make the United States a totalitarian system.
[00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:07.816]  And the way to do that is to scare the people by getting them embroiled into wars.
[00:50:08.356 --> 00:50:09.797]  And this is the amazing part.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:25.711]  The Carnegie Endowment Fund for Peace then plotted to get the United States into World War I and to prolong it, and they said, if you can get the American people into war and be afraid of their survival, they will accept a totalitarian government.
[00:50:26.051 --> 00:50:27.012]  So let's be clear.
[00:50:27.392 --> 00:50:36.118]  It is on record, in the congressional record, the foundations admit they started World War I and World War II to get the UN and the world government.
[00:50:36.218 --> 00:50:37.319]  They are the warmongers.
[00:50:40.188 --> 00:50:41.769]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.031]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:48.794 --> 00:50:52.437]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:50:52.457 --> 00:50:55.819]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:50:56.059 --> 00:51:00.863]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:51:00.883 --> 00:51:07.127]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:51:07.247 --> 00:51:09.489]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:51:09.989 --> 00:51:10.289]  Tim Geithner?
[00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.730]  Bernanke?
[00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:11.431]  They're arsonists!
[00:51:11.491 --> 00:51:12.772]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:51:12.792 --> 00:51:15.035]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:30.752]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:51:30.772 --> 00:51:35.874]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:51:36.194 --> 00:51:46.119]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:52.521]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:52.982 --> 00:51:55.743]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:10.854 --> 00:52:12.575]  Now into the fourth and final hour.
[00:52:12.976 --> 00:52:14.757]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[00:52:14.817 --> 00:52:15.758]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:52:16.178 --> 00:52:31.629]  He's breaking down the embryonic development of this world government that is to be captained and controlled and piloted by a handful of ultra-rich elite families intermarried with the royalty of Europe.
[00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:34.632]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, all the usual names.
[00:52:35.472 --> 00:52:38.214]  And you could ignore G. Edward Griffin 30, 40,
[00:52:40.104 --> 00:52:41.767]  50 years ago when he had all the documents.
[00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:44.832]  People would say, oh, I'm not going to look at those.
[00:52:46.054 --> 00:52:48.558]  But now it's openly being announced.
[00:52:49.479 --> 00:52:50.821]  Jebra Griffin, please continue.
[00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:54.266]  And then let's get into why they're now announcing it, what that means.
[00:52:55.674 --> 00:52:58.236]  Well, my initial reaction to that question is not a very optimistic reaction.
[00:52:58.256 --> 00:52:58.776]  I think, honestly, that
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:31.045]  They feel that it's so close now that you need to talk about it and condition the American mind into accepting it as a reality.
[00:53:31.105 --> 00:53:32.966]  There comes a point when you say, hey, here it is.
[00:53:33.466 --> 00:53:34.167]  Get used to it.
[00:53:34.767 --> 00:53:39.810]  And I think they've come to that phase in the historical development that they're telling us just to get used to it.
[00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:48.195]  Also, I think it's partly because after all of these years, very few people are indignant about it anymore.
[00:53:48.215 --> 00:53:49.476]  I mean, there was a time
[00:53:51.475 --> 00:54:06.968]  20, 30, 40 years ago, when the mere mention of what's happening today as a possibility, you'd probably not just be laughed down, but you'd probably be squirted with tars and feathers because it would sound like you were speaking against America.
[00:54:07.028 --> 00:54:08.489]  You know, people did not want to hear that.
[00:54:08.749 --> 00:54:09.370]  That's absurd.
[00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:11.191]  That's not considerate and so forth.
[00:54:11.552 --> 00:54:14.154]  Well, now people say, oh yeah, well, we all know that.
[00:54:14.234 --> 00:54:15.095]  Yeah, yeah, well.
[00:54:15.575 --> 00:54:42.081]  Yeah, we've had to give up our freedom in order to protect ourselves against the Nazis in World War II, and now we've had to give up more freedom to protect ourselves against the terrorists in World War III, and yes, we have to give up our freedom to protect ourselves against swine flu, and we have to give up our freedom in order to protect ourselves against an economic collapse, and all that formula that they talked about in those days keeps coming to haunt us, is that everybody's afraid of this, that, and the other thing.
[00:54:42.741 --> 00:54:42.961]  I think?
[00:55:00.595 --> 00:55:08.283]  There's a capitulation, a broke-back, just giving in to whatever happens and really going along with it.
[00:55:08.323 --> 00:55:13.068]  But there is a larger and larger minority that is awake and is upset.
[00:55:13.489 --> 00:55:19.856]  But going back to what you said before the break, that in their own documents, and I had a high school teacher that talked about this,
[00:55:21.127 --> 00:55:39.239]  In their own Carnegie documents, clearly that's one of the central foundations, the center of the spoke, but the Rockefeller Foundation, from all my research, you can add to that if you'd like, but that they created these wars and financed the boogeymen, the Saddam Husseins, the Bin Ladens, the Hitlers, the Mussolini's.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:55.029]  The Lenin's and it's in mainline history but just not popularly advertised that this is what they did and now they're making humanity the enemy as the CFR and Club of Rome documents have stated in the last 10 years
[00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:58.653]  They openly admit the environmental movement's fake.
[00:55:59.033 --> 00:56:03.479]  They openly admit that that's a pretext to make everyone an enemy.
[00:56:03.659 --> 00:56:06.302]  Everyone someone bad that the government has to come after.
[00:56:06.702 --> 00:56:09.205]  And that terrorism makes everyone a potential enemy.
[00:56:09.445 --> 00:56:11.387]  And the flu, anyone could have it.
[00:56:12.148 --> 00:56:13.570]  So, I mean, this is tyranny.
[00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:15.112]  This is how America dies.
[00:56:16.311 --> 00:56:17.552]  Well, there's no question about it.
[00:56:18.053 --> 00:56:26.501]  I guess I haven't seen them openly admit this so much, but they certainly are talking about it as though it's a fait accompli.
[00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:27.242]  It's already here.
[00:56:27.582 --> 00:56:30.605]  So we don't have to sell anybody on the idea.
[00:56:30.665 --> 00:56:31.947]  Hey, it's already happened, folks.
[00:56:31.967 --> 00:56:33.028]  You know, get used to it.
[00:56:33.468 --> 00:56:35.390]  What do you mean you don't see them openly?
[00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:47.779]  I mean, CFR reports, Ban Ki-moon in the New York Times two weeks ago saying global government, Al Gore saying global government, saying that the IMF will be the new bank of the world we pay carbon taxes to?
[00:56:47.799 --> 00:56:53.463]  Oh no, I see that, but what I don't see is them admitting that they're using deceit and trickery.
[00:56:53.664 --> 00:56:55.805]  They're still keeping that pretty much under wraps.
[00:56:57.475 --> 00:57:06.579]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:57:06.619 --> 00:57:09.740]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:15.683]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[00:57:15.843 --> 00:57:20.345]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:57:20.625 --> 00:57:22.966]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:57:23.246 --> 00:57:32.331]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[00:57:32.451 --> 00:57:37.854]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[00:57:37.994 --> 00:57:39.835]  Help others and earn extra income!
[00:57:39.855 --> 00:57:40.075]  I think so.
[00:57:58.103 --> 00:58:00.704]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:01.104 --> 00:58:06.005]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:06.365 --> 00:58:08.105]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:08.425 --> 00:58:13.227]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:13.427 --> 00:58:14.387]  How much do you want?
[00:58:14.607 --> 00:58:15.347]  When do you want it?
[00:58:15.727 --> 00:58:17.328]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:58:17.608 --> 00:58:18.428]  When will you need it?
[00:58:18.688 --> 00:58:20.748]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:58:20.888 --> 00:58:21.989]  Will there be any food?
[00:58:22.229 --> 00:58:23.529]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:58:23.749 --> 00:58:28.815]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:58:29.015 --> 00:58:32.218]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:58:32.599 --> 00:58:36.102]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:58:36.423 --> 00:58:37.404]  How much will you need?
[00:58:37.644 --> 00:58:38.265]  We don't know.
[00:58:38.545 --> 00:58:39.466]  How much do you want?
[00:58:39.666 --> 00:58:40.387]  All you can get.
[00:58:40.407 --> 00:58:41.268]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:41.748 --> 00:58:42.388]  We're good to go.
[00:58:56.954 --> 00:59:03.799]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:05.180]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:05.880]  It's very real.

[01:00:02.787 --> 01:00:03.427]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.087 --> 01:00:05.128]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:05.848 --> 01:00:06.969]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:08.429]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:09.950]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.738 --> 01:00:26.722]  Gee, Edward, I want to start taking calls in the next segment and also get into solutions with you, but you've got the floor.
[01:00:27.283 --> 01:00:35.225]  Break down their system of crisis creation, what's currently happening with the carbon tax, the government health care, the banks.
[01:00:36.297 --> 01:00:45.123]  It's come out even in McClatchy News Service that Goldman Sachs imploded the housing market on purpose, engineered it to destroy their competition, to get the bailouts and hoard the money.
[01:00:45.744 --> 01:00:51.367]  Goldman Sachs, of course, is the inner group that pilots the Federal Reserve System.
[01:00:52.466 --> 01:00:58.609]  And that also holds the federal regulatory positions in almost every agency, two, three, four deep.
[01:00:59.849 --> 01:01:08.232]  And where we're going with this system, what the world is going to look like in a decade, 20 years, if they succeed from the research.
[01:01:08.773 --> 01:01:13.254]  So what they're doing currently, and then what the world will look like if they succeed.
[01:01:13.274 --> 01:01:16.876]  G. Edward Griffin, you've got the floor all the way out to the next break.
[01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:20.494]  Well, that's quite a topic.
[01:01:20.915 --> 01:01:26.836]  As a matter of fact, I've started to put a series of seminars on the road, Alex, called the Crash Course on Money.
[01:01:27.556 --> 01:01:32.857]  And before I forget it, we just decided the other evening to come to Austin on December 12th.
[01:01:33.517 --> 01:01:35.858]  So we'll talk about that later.
[01:01:36.118 --> 01:01:39.198]  But anyway, the Crash Course on Money is a full day seminar.
[01:01:39.498 --> 01:01:44.079]  And I devoted a lot of time to answering just the question that you've raised.
[01:01:44.399 --> 01:01:46.660]  Where are we going and what can we do about it?
[01:01:47.563 --> 01:01:52.937]  Well, in a nutshell, anybody that listens to your program has got a pretty good idea.
[01:01:53.559 --> 01:01:56.046]  We're going to a complete command economy.
[01:01:56.827 --> 01:02:00.670]  Where the free market, what's left of it today, will be completely dead.
[01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:03.653]  I'm not predicting that this must happen.
[01:02:03.693 --> 01:02:10.959]  I'm saying that if there are no changes, if we continue going in the direction that we're headed, we're going to reach where we're headed, that's all.
[01:02:11.339 --> 01:02:22.428]  And we're headed right toward a command economy that's no different substantially than the command economy of the old Soviet Union or the Red China or any of the
[01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:24.142]  Or Nazi Germany.
[01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:28.624]  In other words, prices will be completely controlled.
[01:02:29.044 --> 01:02:31.005]  Employment will be completely controlled.
[01:02:33.586 --> 01:02:45.112]  Your complete dependence for your food, your shelter, your health care, your education, everything that's important will be provided and regulated by the masters in Washington, D.C.
[01:02:45.832 --> 01:02:46.513]  It's a very dismal picture.
[01:02:46.533 --> 01:02:51.956]  It's a high-tech feudalism, and it's definitely in our future, and not our distant future, I might say, if things continue as they are.
[01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:15.612]  What can you do about that?
[01:03:15.652 --> 01:03:19.436]  Well, there's nothing you can do about it except to change the direction that we're headed.
[01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:22.078]  You can't just say, well, what should we invest in?
[01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:25.521]  You know, that might help a little bit.
[01:03:25.882 --> 01:03:30.286]  It might get you a few weeks or months down the line with a little bit of independence.
[01:03:30.586 --> 01:03:35.711]  But when the jackboots show up and say, into the truck, that's the end of the line, investments or not.
[01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:37.673]  So we've got to change the system.
[01:03:38.334 --> 01:03:39.755]  And of course, we're
[01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:47.100]  I'm always talking about Freedom Force International when I start thinking about changing the system, recapturing the system.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.060]  But how can you protect yourself in the meantime?
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.441]  There's a short-term view and a long-term view.
[01:03:53.861 --> 01:03:57.722]  People are naturally concerned about that short-term view.
[01:03:58.402 --> 01:04:07.084]  And, you know, you've got a lot of your sponsors on your program that I think have excellent solutions for short-term survival, if you will.
[01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:09.085]  Sure, we ought to have food.
[01:04:10.672 --> 01:04:32.061]  Good drinking water, we ought to have electrical power at our disposal, we ought to have gold and silver, something that will be readily accepted by almost everybody when it comes time to replace the electronic money system that probably will be completely collapsed at one point.
[01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:38.764]  So yeah, those are things you can do for the short term, but the long term, the only thing that will work is to recapture the system.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:47.086]  Then we start, in the seminar, we'll be talking about this thing of revolution versus revolt.
[01:04:47.746 --> 01:04:52.410]  And that's quite an interesting topic because I don't think many people have considered the difference.
[01:04:53.872 --> 01:04:58.115]  There's a rising energy for resistance today.
[01:04:58.195 --> 01:05:04.381]  People are angry as that television, or I guess it's not television, it was a movie,
[01:05:05.021 --> 01:05:05.962]  I can't think of the name of it.
[01:05:06.042 --> 01:05:07.123]  Network, I guess it was.
[01:05:07.183 --> 01:05:11.366]  The guy says, you know, we're mad as hell and we ain't going to take it no more, or whatever he says.
[01:05:11.727 --> 01:05:14.269]  Well, that's kind of the mood of the American people.
[01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:16.050]  We're mad, we're not going to take it anymore.
[01:05:16.431 --> 01:05:20.354]  But the idea that you just get mad and not take it anymore is going to make a difference?
[01:05:20.534 --> 01:05:22.055]  No, they don't care about that.
[01:05:22.856 --> 01:05:28.961]  The elitists have been anticipating years, years in advance for some kind of an uprising.
[01:05:29.986 --> 01:05:32.228]  They've been building FEMA camps for that.
[01:05:32.288 --> 01:05:44.637]  They've been equipping the local police in crowd control, and they've been developing weapons specifically for demonstrators and crowds of people and rioters and so forth.
[01:05:45.238 --> 01:05:56.586]  They know it's coming, and in my opinion, I think they want it to come, which is a frightening thing, because I think they want people out making all of this ruckus so they can have a good excuse
[01:05:56.966 --> 01:05:58.066]  We're good to go.
[01:06:20.601 --> 01:06:29.847]  Revolts are just an uprising of people with no leadership, no strategy, no goal, no organization, no funding, no communications.
[01:06:30.127 --> 01:06:34.250]  Just a bunch of people that say, I've had it and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:39.393]  And they wind up in the streets with rocks and stones and sticks or whatever they've got.
[01:06:40.113 --> 01:06:43.335]  And it'd be like the Hungarian revolt back in the 60s.
[01:06:44.316 --> 01:06:45.116]  Revolts never work.
[01:06:47.095 --> 01:06:47.335]  That's
[01:07:02.302 --> 01:07:03.403]  It dissipates.
[01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:04.504]  It goes away.
[01:07:04.524 --> 01:07:05.824]  They don't have resources.
[01:07:05.884 --> 01:07:07.165]  They don't have food.
[01:07:07.626 --> 01:07:08.446]  They don't have water.
[01:07:08.466 --> 01:07:11.228]  They don't have leadership, communications, and all those things.
[01:07:11.268 --> 01:07:15.311]  And the revolt gradually just dissipates.
[01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:18.753]  And no revolt in history has ever been successful in the long run.
[01:07:19.433 --> 01:07:24.295]  Revolutions, on the other hand, often are successful, but that's because they're quite different from revolts.
[01:07:24.695 --> 01:07:27.196]  They have all of the things that revolts don't have.
[01:07:27.556 --> 01:07:37.740]  They do have leadership and strategy and financing and communications, and especially they have military training and military units already in place.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.540]  It's quite different.
[01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:46.723]  All you need to do is take a look at the American Revolution, and you can see immediately that that was not a revolt.
[01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:48.664]  That was a revolution.
[01:07:49.004 --> 01:07:51.905]  We had 13 governments that came together.
[01:07:52.246 --> 01:07:53.426]  They were complete governments.
[01:07:53.526 --> 01:08:13.077]  They had their leadership, they had taxes, they had courts, they had representation, they had military units, they had armories with ammunition, they had training, military training and discipline, and 13 governments came together and unified and stood up against the government of the Crown of England.
[01:08:13.661 --> 01:08:21.545]  Had they just been farmers with pitchforks or muskets, there's no way in the world they could have successfully stood up against King George.
[01:08:21.925 --> 01:08:23.105]  But they were organized.
[01:08:23.546 --> 01:08:26.347]  And so they really created a revolution.
[01:08:26.932 --> 01:08:32.154]  So now, we look at today and all these people running around saying, well, it's about time to have a revolution.
[01:08:32.554 --> 01:08:35.035]  They have no idea what they're talking about.
[01:08:35.515 --> 01:08:41.638]  And if you listen to those people, I think it's going to be a great tragedy for the Americans who fall for it.
[01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:44.599]  It'll be one of the greatest bloodbaths of all history, I'm afraid.
[01:08:44.699 --> 01:08:49.363]  Well, G. Edward, we see the provocateurs online with websites and commenting.
[01:08:49.724 --> 01:08:50.825]  We can track who they are.
[01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:53.727]  In many cases it comes out later they were FBI informants.
[01:08:54.368 --> 01:09:00.193]  They're always calling for shooting and killing and war, and they always go around saying, Alex Jones is a coward.
[01:09:00.494 --> 01:09:02.996]  He's not calling for killing cops and military.
[01:09:03.376 --> 01:09:06.739]  And I say, that person's got to be a fed or they'd be arrested.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:11.083]  And then years later it comes out they're all feds, on record, in court,
[01:09:12.785 --> 01:09:14.325]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:09:14.685 --> 01:09:18.327]  That's why the federal government stages terror attacks like Oklahoma City and 9-11.
[01:09:18.807 --> 01:09:20.989]  They need to make themselves the victims.
[01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:33.475]  They need to have offensive attacks against themselves to have the illusion that they're not the aggressor, because in common sense humanity, people know that an aggressor is the person that is in the wrong.
[01:09:36.926 --> 01:09:42.048]  As we expand down this road, it's obvious.
[01:09:42.148 --> 01:09:48.270]  Anybody saying, you're a coward, you're not calling for violence, you notice they're not marching out and carrying out the violence.
[01:09:48.570 --> 01:09:58.374]  Now that doesn't mean that we don't defensively protect ourselves, and the Second Amendment is something that's been holding back the tyranny, because they know it would go badly for them if they go on the offensive against us.
[01:09:58.714 --> 01:10:05.257]  So the question for the controllers is, how do they go on the offensive against the people of the world without
[01:10:06.117 --> 01:10:06.378]  I don't
[01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:32.697]  At the colleges and at the hospitals and the shopping malls, where we're all searched and randomly lined up on the side of the street and put through body scanners.
[01:10:33.157 --> 01:10:37.741]  England's about five years ahead of us, as you know, and they're doing the exact same thing.
[01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:39.602]  They are bringing in tyranny.
[01:10:39.622 --> 01:10:46.447]  They're saying parents have to have a license to have kids and be with them in public to prove they're not pedophiles.
[01:10:46.467 --> 01:10:53.232]  20,000 homes with newborn babies have cameras in the homes watching them to make sure they're good parents, guilty until proven innocent.
[01:10:53.892 --> 01:10:59.237]  And when I ask you about their future operation, I've read their documents, I know what their future operation is.
[01:10:59.658 --> 01:11:04.202]  If they win, I just wanted your perspective and view on that because they say
[01:11:05.182 --> 01:11:07.183]  They're going to raise people outside the home.
[01:11:07.504 --> 01:11:09.245]  First it'll start with year-round school.
[01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:12.827]  Then they'll come and assess your home and say you don't have enough money to have kids.
[01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:15.249]  Your kids will now live in a government facility.
[01:11:15.609 --> 01:11:18.911]  Not just kids that the CPS grabs, but everybody's children.
[01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:21.113]  How will they take the middle class's money?
[01:11:21.133 --> 01:11:22.174]  Through property tax.
[01:11:22.474 --> 01:11:28.998]  How are they going to break us down incrementally till we're fully institutionalized all of us prisoners?
[01:11:29.299 --> 01:11:30.880]  That was the point I wanted you to get into.
[01:11:31.638 --> 01:11:36.601]  Yeah, well, it sounds like a little music in the background there, meaning the end of the session.
[01:11:37.401 --> 01:11:38.482]  The end of this segment.
[01:11:38.502 --> 01:11:41.764]  We're going to come right back and get your take on that and then take phone calls when we come back.
[01:11:42.124 --> 01:11:48.167]  I might just twist G. Edward Griffin to stay the whole rest of the hour because time is moving so quickly with our guest today.
[01:11:48.187 --> 01:11:50.248]  He's going to be speaking in several cities.
[01:11:50.569 --> 01:11:52.550]  We'll tell you about that before he leaves as well.
[01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.231]  Your chance to meet the legend.
[01:11:54.531 --> 01:11:56.552]  G. Edward Griffin, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:11:57.918 --> 01:11:59.058]  The once mighty U.S.
[01:11:59.098 --> 01:12:01.699]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[01:12:02.139 --> 01:12:04.720]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.620]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:11.761]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[01:12:12.262 --> 01:12:19.883]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders, and Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[01:12:20.364 --> 01:12:21.084]  Prepare now.
[01:12:22.344 --> 01:12:22.724]  I think so.

[01:13:59.108 --> 01:14:02.755]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:14:03.135 --> 01:14:06.141]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:14:06.381 --> 01:14:07.784]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:14:08.516 --> 01:14:11.158]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:14:11.178 --> 01:14:17.401]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:22.584]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:14:22.744 --> 01:14:32.750]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:34.971]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:14:35.211 --> 01:14:36.531]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:39.052]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:14:39.252 --> 01:14:41.092]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:14:41.372 --> 01:14:46.134]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:05.963]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:11.946]  and Canada.
[01:15:12.266 --> 01:15:18.849]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:15:19.369 --> 01:15:22.650]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:24.951]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[01:16:29.886 --> 01:16:37.053]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[01:16:37.914 --> 01:16:39.655]  Your phone call is coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:16:43.823 --> 01:16:59.034]  This scientific dictatorship, the final revolution as the elites have called it, is a scientific tyranny based on psychology, anthropology, human activity, public relations, propaganda, to bring in this tyranny.
[01:16:59.594 --> 01:17:01.415]  World government is only the beginning.
[01:17:01.816 --> 01:17:05.118]  What comes once they have their world government?
[01:17:05.378 --> 01:17:07.400]  Because you talk about them running our lives.
[01:17:08.411 --> 01:17:09.772]  And providing everything.
[01:17:09.812 --> 01:17:11.393]  You mean providing euthanasia?
[01:17:11.833 --> 01:17:14.234]  You mean providing execution?
[01:17:14.274 --> 01:17:16.215]  You mean providing starvation?
[01:17:16.235 --> 01:17:18.656]  I mean, they're in-game.
[01:17:18.756 --> 01:17:26.100]  Once they have their global straitjacket in place, which they're putting the final tweaks on right now, what comes next from your research, G. Edward Griffin?
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:37.906]  My opinion, Alex, is that we have a gravitation into this power center, this huge concentration of power now globally.
[01:17:38.907 --> 01:17:46.071]  We have a gravitation in there of the greatest criminal minds of the planet at the moment.
[01:17:46.772 --> 01:17:50.214]  This is the predator class attracted to that power.
[01:17:50.814 --> 01:17:56.257]  These are the people running the show who, outside of government, would probably be on death row.
[01:17:56.997 --> 01:18:03.341]  They'd certainly be in prison because they'd be committing all of the most horrendous crimes against their fellow man that you can imagine.
[01:18:04.048 --> 01:18:09.652]  But they've gone into government so that they can be the ones who put other people in prison.
[01:18:10.273 --> 01:18:12.374]  And it's as simple as that.
[01:18:13.195 --> 01:18:17.618]  We're looking at the formation of a huge criminal syndicate.
[01:18:18.279 --> 01:18:25.024]  And so if you understand the mentality of the criminal mind, then you can see what it is they have planned.
[01:18:25.344 --> 01:18:26.324]  What do criminals do?
[01:18:27.446 --> 01:18:35.447]  They want to exploit everybody else, they want to make them serve them, they want to take everything of value from them.
[01:18:36.968 --> 01:18:37.848]  It's that simple.
[01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:56.151]  I think that in some cases these people may have started out with some idealism because they thought that, you know, collectivism was a good idea, because they thought that would put an end to war, but very simply and very quickly they understood that in order to bring collectivism
[01:18:56.571 --> 01:18:56.931]  I think so.
[01:19:21.112 --> 01:19:35.372]  So, use your imagination, you can see the ultimate servitude coming in the future where people will be nothing but little cyphers and they will completely serve their masters and if they don't serve well, they will be exterminated.
[01:19:35.853 --> 01:19:36.694]  It's that simple.
[01:19:39.585 --> 01:19:40.326]  Absolutely.
[01:19:40.846 --> 01:19:43.429]  G. Edward Griffin expanding on that.
[01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:50.775]  For people that don't understand the grave danger we're in, isn't tyranny what we see 99% of the time in history?
[01:19:51.096 --> 01:19:54.159]  Black uniforms, mass arrests, death, poverty.
[01:19:54.479 --> 01:20:02.366]  The elites love to sit up on their pleasure mountains in their palaces with all their power and sex and wars.
[01:20:03.547 --> 01:20:08.810]  It's all about their power trip and everyone else toiling under poverty.
[01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:11.131]  The globalists admitted many of their own statements.
[01:20:11.171 --> 01:20:20.676]  They use poverty as a weapon to suppress people and they enjoy riding past in their armored chariots the rotting hovels and starving children.
[01:20:20.956 --> 01:20:31.361]  To them, children with snot all over their faces with their rib cages sticking out is beautiful because that makes their feathered beds and their servants that much more enjoyable.
[01:20:32.301 --> 01:20:39.368]  You know, Alex, years ago, I came across a quotation from Lenin that addressed this issue.
[01:20:39.929 --> 01:20:46.535]  And Lenin was answering the question, do they have bread lines in Russia, in the Soviet Union in those days?
[01:20:46.996 --> 01:20:48.557]  He said, of course we have bread lines.
[01:20:48.617 --> 01:20:49.818]  And he said, let me tell you why.
[01:20:49.838 --> 01:20:53.082]  He said, when we have bread lines, there is scarcity.
[01:20:53.682 --> 01:21:05.616]  And scarcity is good for a system like ours because people have to get in line to get their food and if they're in line they don't have a lot of time to become politically active.
[01:21:06.044 --> 01:21:08.886]  They don't have a lot of time to organize against the state.
[01:21:09.306 --> 01:21:14.929]  And if the lines are very long, then you have to have policemen to keep order in the lines.
[01:21:15.009 --> 01:21:18.551]  And people become desperate, and they become very controllable.
[01:21:19.011 --> 01:21:26.075]  And he said, with long lines and shortages, therefore the state can determine who gets fed and who does not.
[01:21:26.435 --> 01:21:30.958]  And so scarcity becomes an objective of these collectivist systems.
[01:21:31.385 --> 01:21:36.048]  And that's why they want everyone in the world on a carbon credit ration card.
[01:21:36.148 --> 01:21:41.051]  You slide, and when you go past your credits, no more food, even if you have the money to buy it.
[01:21:41.291 --> 01:21:44.473]  That is inches away from being law in California and England.
[01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:48.836]  We're on the march.
[01:21:49.336 --> 01:21:50.917]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:50.937 --> 01:21:54.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:57.406 --> 01:22:02.593]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:22:02.713 --> 01:22:04.656]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:22:04.796 --> 01:22:07.099]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:22:07.239 --> 01:22:09.102]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:22:09.522 --> 01:22:10.884]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:22:11.144 --> 01:22:12.186]  There is a solution.
[01:22:12.406 --> 01:22:20.428]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:22:34.312 --> 01:22:39.894]  I love their Nutri Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:22:57.352 --> 01:23:06.475]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:23:06.495 --> 01:23:09.636]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:23:09.876 --> 01:23:15.578]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:23:15.738 --> 01:23:20.240]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.861]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:23:23.141 --> 01:23:32.229]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:23:32.329 --> 01:23:37.753]  He also recommends ZeoLife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[01:23:57.844 --> 01:24:02.070]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:06.476]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:24:06.736 --> 01:24:12.143]  Number two, our new Energy Czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:24:12.484 --> 01:24:12.824]  It's true.
[01:24:12.824 --> 01:24:17.785]  Number two, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:22.187]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:24:22.487 --> 01:24:26.208]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:24:26.408 --> 01:24:29.589]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:24:29.969 --> 01:24:33.310]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:38.354]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:43.358]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:25:11.533 --> 01:25:13.616]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[01:25:13.676 --> 01:25:15.758]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:25:15.838 --> 01:25:18.081]  He's a big part of Fall of the Republic.
[01:25:18.501 --> 01:25:21.625]  We're going to take some phone calls now in the 10 minutes or so we have left with him.
[01:25:21.665 --> 01:25:24.989]  Jim, Ken, Jason, Kevin, Mark, we'll get to your calls at least.
[01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:31.537]  But G. Edward Griffin, tell us about some of the other speaking engagements you have coming up around the country and where people can find out more.
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:37.685]  Well, the big emphasis right now is the crash course on money that I mentioned before.
[01:25:38.305 --> 01:25:43.530]  And my next one is scheduled on November 21st in New York.
[01:25:44.331 --> 01:25:49.996]  And then after that, December 5 in Seattle and then December 12 in Austin.
[01:25:50.738 --> 01:25:54.820]  And we'll have one in Toronto and one in Chicago after that, but they're not scheduled yet.
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:26:09.146]  And so, if anybody's interested in hearing my views for a whole day on where we're headed and what to do about it, I urge you to come to our Reality Zone site and check out the seminar page.
[01:26:09.506 --> 01:26:11.087]  That's realityzone.com.
[01:26:11.568 --> 01:26:18.192]  You go to the landing page and you'll see my picture there and that's the way into the seminar information.
[01:26:18.433 --> 01:26:28.480]  So that's taken a lot of my time, Alex, and I'm happy to report that the two seminars we've had so far, one in Los Angeles and one in Atlanta last weekend,
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.882]  You're a very powerful lecturer.
[01:26:31.183 --> 01:26:35.528]  It's even more powerful than on the radio because you can really flow.
[01:26:35.608 --> 01:26:38.050]  I want to go to some calls here in the last segment we have with you.
[01:26:47.782 --> 01:26:59.225]  To put a positive light on this, because I truly do believe that some positive things are happening, G. Everett Griffin, we are seeing an exponential awakening.
[01:26:59.265 --> 01:27:05.627]  And the globalists denying they were building this in the past, it's really handicapping them now that they're having to admit it.
[01:27:06.367 --> 01:27:09.228]  And I know they're not invincible.
[01:27:09.668 --> 01:27:15.970]  And if people will take action at the local, county, city, congressional level and really get involved, we can stop them.
[01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:21.752]  And our message of liberty and our message against collectivism is really spreading.
[01:27:22.312 --> 01:27:33.295]  And the globalists in a lot of their own publications, as I know you're aware, are really starting to complain and say that we better hurry up and finish this because the opposition is really starting to mount.
[01:27:34.141 --> 01:27:37.362]  Yeah, they're scared to death of the size of the opposition.
[01:27:38.042 --> 01:27:43.223]  They've always known there would be a lot of it, but I think the size of it is surprising to them.
[01:27:43.623 --> 01:27:52.465]  And of course the internet and talk radio are two of the main channels by which this movement is growing, and they're really focusing hard on those two areas.
[01:27:52.505 --> 01:27:58.006]  They would like to close you down, they'd like to close down the internet as soon as possible.
[01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:02.747]  So our little window of opportunity is not so big, but it's still open.
[01:28:03.207 --> 01:28:07.030]  And I agree with you, we can still do it, but we better get busy.
[01:28:07.471 --> 01:28:09.532]  You know, that's an amazing admission.
[01:28:09.872 --> 01:28:20.621]  Jay Rockefeller in the Senate committee saying we would have been better off without the internet, having Obama come out and say the NSA is taking over the web, we may have to shut it off to save it during emergencies.
[01:28:21.001 --> 01:28:26.605]  They're really setting the stage to control the internet and shut it down and tax it and regulate it.
[01:28:27.446 --> 01:28:30.689]  Things are moving very quickly and they wouldn't be getting ready to shut it off
[01:28:31.629 --> 01:28:34.750]  And starting to broach the subject if it wasn't hurting them.
[01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:37.611]  Jim in Illinois, you're on the air with G. Edward Griffin.
[01:28:37.631 --> 01:28:38.031]  Go ahead.
[01:28:38.872 --> 01:28:39.732]  Hey guys, how's it going?
[01:28:39.752 --> 01:28:40.652]  Thanks for everything you do.
[01:28:41.232 --> 01:28:44.674]  I just had a couple comments, kind of expanding on what you're talking about.
[01:28:45.534 --> 01:29:00.519]  Just more like, I think there might be a couple things that could at least slow them down a little, and you know, if we could maybe audit the Fed, get that moving, if we could get any kind of 9-11 truth going, and you know, if there was any possible way to get our
[01:29:01.138 --> 01:29:03.000]  I like the concept of the next generation.
[01:29:28.434 --> 01:29:34.581]  I think that by the next generation, and certainly the one after that, victory will be ours.
[01:29:35.102 --> 01:29:39.767]  But I don't think it'll be because of just overwhelming them with numbers.
[01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:43.912]  I think it'll be because out of those who do understand
[01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:44.885]  I think?
[01:30:04.901 --> 01:30:06.762]  Hey Alex, I just have some questions about the H.R.
[01:30:06.782 --> 01:30:06.762]  1207.
[01:30:06.802 --> 01:30:09.142]  I'm just wondering why this bill has 311 co-sponsors.
[01:30:09.222 --> 01:30:10.483]  Why haven't we heard about anything?
[01:30:33.292 --> 01:30:39.033]  Because the mainstream media is owned by the same banks that don't want to be audited.
[01:30:39.374 --> 01:30:42.034]  Ron Paul has over 309 sponsors.
[01:30:42.534 --> 01:30:47.155]  The Senate gutted the bill, but we've gone from no sponsors to 300.
[01:30:47.495 --> 01:30:53.357]  Now people are beginning to realize the real government is the Federal Reserve, so the beginning of the end has begun.
[01:30:53.417 --> 01:31:00.979]  We've made more strides the last three or four years against the private Federal Reserve than we made in the last 50, so the worm is turning.
[01:31:02.438 --> 01:31:03.919]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:31:04.339 --> 01:31:10.421]  However, we must be realistic that a lot of those co-sponsors for that bill are doing some grandstanding.
[01:31:10.721 --> 01:31:12.962]  They know that their constituents want them to look good.
[01:31:13.342 --> 01:31:19.484]  If you asked a lot of those guys, would they be in favor of abolishing the Fed, they'd say, hell no, man, I wouldn't do anything like that.
[01:31:20.324 --> 01:31:24.665]  But I want to add the caveat here, and I understand what you're saying, why audit it, just abolish it.
[01:31:25.065 --> 01:31:26.385]  Ron Paul's being shrewd here.
[01:31:26.765 --> 01:31:35.387]  If they can audit, it will so damage the Fed and expose their activities and their insider manipulations that that will be the beginning of the end.
[01:31:35.867 --> 01:31:39.188]  And so Ron Paul's using an incremental approach here.
[01:31:39.228 --> 01:31:46.929]  I understand a lot of it is grandstanding, but it still overall is very positive to point out it's never been audited.
[01:31:47.529 --> 01:31:48.250]  Oh, I agree with that.
[01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:51.952]  And I do endorse this movement for that reason.
[01:31:51.972 --> 01:31:55.215]  And also it's a means of causing people to think about the Fed.
[01:31:55.235 --> 01:31:56.656]  They never thought about it before.
[01:31:56.936 --> 01:31:57.176]  Exactly.
[01:31:57.237 --> 01:31:59.598]  And now they're only thinking about it, but in a negative light.
[01:31:59.658 --> 01:32:01.620]  So it's really a good move.
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:07.845]  But anyway, we must be realistic that a lot of the support is not as deep as Ron's support.
[01:32:08.205 --> 01:32:08.825]  Thank you, Ken.
[01:32:09.006 --> 01:32:10.507]  Jason and Mass, you're on the air.
[01:32:10.547 --> 01:32:10.927]  Go ahead.
[01:32:10.947 --> 01:32:13.789]  Hi, Mr. Griffin.
[01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.890]  Hello.
[01:32:14.970 --> 01:32:15.230]  Hello.
[01:32:15.691 --> 01:32:15.971]  Hello.
[01:32:15.991 --> 01:32:16.892]  Yeah, you're on air.
[01:32:17.927 --> 01:32:18.628]  Oh, hey.
[01:32:18.848 --> 01:32:19.748]  Great show, Alex.
[01:32:19.828 --> 01:32:21.229]  I've been listening for about a year.
[01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:24.271]  I've been sending out hundreds of DVDs.
[01:32:24.391 --> 01:32:25.332]  I love the new movie.
[01:32:26.313 --> 01:32:28.354]  Mr. Griffin, your books are excellent.
[01:32:28.914 --> 01:32:33.417]  And I wanted you to know that you've inspired me to do a comic book about the Fed.
[01:32:34.318 --> 01:32:39.181]  And I'd love to share that with you somehow, or maybe even get some feedback on it from you someday.
[01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:40.562]  That'd be amazing.
[01:32:42.009 --> 01:32:43.930]  I'd love to see a comic book on the Fed.
[01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:48.811]  I don't think it'd be money, but it would be probably effective.
[01:32:49.632 --> 01:32:54.013]  I'm trying to put some humor in it, actually, because it's too dreadful.
[01:32:56.254 --> 01:32:57.574]  Alex, I just had a comment.
[01:32:59.214 --> 01:33:00.995]  Maybe, Mr. Griffin, you could comment on this.
[01:33:02.816 --> 01:33:03.296]  Excuse me.
[01:33:03.976 --> 01:33:10.858]  I get angry when I hear all these dirt talkers bothering you and getting you upset.
[01:33:11.388 --> 01:33:19.692]  And I've been wondering for a long time why you even acknowledge some of them when, as you say, your fruits speak for you and being a gentleman.
[01:33:21.826 --> 01:33:31.654]  You know, why you need to respond to some of them when, you know, I don't think a gentleman really needs to... Well, I mean, we're talking about this right now.
[01:33:31.674 --> 01:33:33.096]  I appreciate your call.
[01:33:33.356 --> 01:33:38.420]  Look, there's going to be COINTELPRO that's going to attack G. Edward Griffin, myself, everybody else.
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.181]  It doesn't matter.
[01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:40.882]  The world government's here.
[01:33:41.142 --> 01:33:42.163]  There's no more denial.
[01:33:42.483 --> 01:33:43.684]  What are we going to do about it?
[01:33:43.704 --> 01:33:45.086]  Do you have any comments on this, G. Edward?
[01:33:45.646 --> 01:33:48.209]  Well, yeah, I think his issue was why do I waste time?
[01:33:48.329 --> 01:33:51.431]  I presume he's talking about our newsletter, Unfiltered News.
[01:33:51.832 --> 01:33:57.377]  I get some people that come in and they want to tear my arguments apart, and I often do respond.
[01:33:57.717 --> 01:34:10.269]  And the reason I do that is not because I expect to convince these people, but, you know, they do raise issues that I think are in the minds of others that I feel that if I don't answer them,
[01:34:11.299 --> 01:34:26.413]  I'm not doing my job and I'm really, I try to answer them as best I can without becoming antagonistic or angry because I'm really writing for other people to read and not the person who's written in that dirt talk as he calls it.
[01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:32.814]  Because we know that they just throw out those lies hoping ignorant people then think we're lying.
[01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:33.695]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:34:34.155 --> 01:34:39.281]  I noticed a campaign on the web in the last two weeks when I made a big deal out of Ban Ki-moon.
[01:34:39.982 --> 01:34:42.604]  He is the Secretary General of the UN.
[01:34:42.624 --> 01:34:43.585]  The UN is real.
[01:34:44.306 --> 01:34:45.666]  The New York Times is real.
[01:34:46.087 --> 01:34:48.127]  The title was, We Can Do It.
[01:34:48.627 --> 01:34:58.010]  And I noticed that this info campaign on my comment pages and on YouTube, and I wasn't even looking for this, under different names with the same cut and paste, saying, I went and looked at that.
[01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:59.911]  Ban Ki-moon didn't write that.
[01:35:00.431 --> 01:35:01.331]  It's a lie.
[01:35:01.671 --> 01:35:03.152]  He never said global government.
[01:35:03.792 --> 01:35:09.236]  And they're not targeting thinkers or they're not targeting people that already know the truth.
[01:35:09.296 --> 01:35:17.941]  They just want the average person to read that and think I'm lying because that's what a lot of propaganda is just down and dirty meant to get people off track.
[01:35:18.662 --> 01:35:19.542]  Yeah, sound bites.
[01:35:19.582 --> 01:35:20.463]  They love sound bites.
[01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:26.340]  I got a real hard look at that the other day when I saw a panel on the CFR.
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:31.062]  They were in the CFR building talking about how to convince people to go get those flu shots.
[01:35:31.402 --> 01:35:33.082]  And they said, well, we should have sound bites.
[01:35:33.262 --> 01:35:40.484]  Like, for example, and then they said, tell the people that there's more mercury in a tuna sandwich than in a flu shot.
[01:35:41.124 --> 01:35:41.624]  Soundbite.
[01:35:41.924 --> 01:35:42.264]  Bingo!
[01:35:42.545 --> 01:36:05.332]  And to show that the CFR is really calling a lot of the shots or setting up the implementing the policy that was a month ago now suddenly we see the tuna fish sandwich line everywhere and they also laugh and say we'll say there's not enough vaccine only have it at certain spots to create a panic to put that on the news and then they all laugh see it's so fun to criminally manipulate
[01:36:05.768 --> 01:36:13.312]  Yeah, so there it is, and that's why they love soundbites, because as you said, the unthinking people will accept that as substance.
[01:36:13.932 --> 01:36:15.313]  Alright, we're going to let you go in just a moment.
[01:36:15.333 --> 01:36:16.153]  I know you're a busy man.
[01:36:16.173 --> 01:36:17.814]  We're going to take two quick final calls.
[01:36:18.194 --> 01:36:19.835]  Kevin in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:36:19.895 --> 01:36:20.315]  Go ahead.
[01:36:21.576 --> 01:36:22.356]  Thanks for having me.
[01:36:23.136 --> 01:36:25.257]  I just had a question and a comment.
[01:36:25.878 --> 01:36:35.002]  My comment is, through their systems of roundtable groups and their power structure, they're squeezing us like a cancer from the inside.
[01:36:35.822 --> 01:36:45.007]  Why don't we just start, as a people, just informing their power structure and their groups to what's going on by handing out your documentaries and letting them know what's going wrong.
[01:36:45.287 --> 01:36:45.867]  Well, that's true.
[01:36:45.907 --> 01:36:52.510]  There are a lot of people compartmentalized at higher levels who really don't see the big picture, and that's a lot of the whistleblowers we have.
[01:36:52.791 --> 01:36:54.091]  The media just ignores them.
[01:36:54.131 --> 01:36:56.232]  We, the alternative media, have to magnify that.
[01:36:57.173 --> 01:36:59.274]  But, G. Edward, comments on that?
[01:36:59.878 --> 01:37:01.980]  Well, I think your caller has the solution.
[01:37:02.641 --> 01:37:04.482]  We just have to use the handout power.
[01:37:05.023 --> 01:37:15.152]  And boy, we got a lot of people out there, if they're just willing to hand out 10 or 20 DVDs or CDs, we'll reach the world that way.
[01:37:15.172 --> 01:37:16.433]  And that's why they're so scared.
[01:37:16.493 --> 01:37:18.895]  And so what I'm saying is I agree.
[01:37:18.955 --> 01:37:20.016]  Let's get on with it.
[01:37:20.056 --> 01:37:20.516]  Let's do it.
[01:37:21.077 --> 01:37:24.200]  Okay, let's talk to Shanky in Georgia.
[01:37:25.814 --> 01:37:28.076]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:37:28.496 --> 01:37:28.877]  Shanky.
[01:37:29.658 --> 01:37:31.199]  Alex Jedward, thanks for having me.
[01:37:31.639 --> 01:37:35.663]  Alex, I want to thank you and Genesis and your whole team, everything for what y'all do.
[01:37:36.384 --> 01:37:41.348]  Jedward, your books and work is magnificent.
[01:37:41.769 --> 01:37:46.973]  You're right, I used to want to call up and disagree with you and get to the front of the line, Alex.
[01:37:47.394 --> 01:37:48.535]  I'm quite a conservative.
[01:37:49.221 --> 01:37:52.964]  But I've changed quite a bit, and come to see the light, so to speak.
[01:37:53.224 --> 01:37:56.306]  Follow the public, and all your movies are just fantastic.
[01:37:56.446 --> 01:37:57.567]  I really enjoy them.
[01:37:58.027 --> 01:38:01.150]  As a matter of fact, I've got them at the top of my blog for everybody to see.
[01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:15.160]  Gee, Edward, I've got a quick question, and it's on the stock market, and the monetization, and the open market operations, and their effects on the dollar, the treasuries.
[01:38:16.545 --> 01:38:20.567]  And the actual manipulation of the market to these new highs.
[01:38:20.587 --> 01:38:21.727]  Can you comment on that, please?
[01:38:23.348 --> 01:38:35.612]  Well, there's no question that the Fed has total control over manipulation and ability to manipulate the market by manipulating credit and therefore the amount of money that's in circulation.
[01:38:36.273 --> 01:38:41.555]  And what we see now is that there's a lot of money going out of existence because of
[01:38:42.515 --> 01:38:43.136]  I think so.
[01:39:01.054 --> 01:39:06.678]  And so we see right now kind of a maintenance of the money supply.
[01:39:07.098 --> 01:39:12.722]  It's not growing nearly as fast as we might expect because there's money going out of existence at the same time.
[01:39:13.222 --> 01:39:19.626]  But what people are missing is the fact that the old money going out of existence is coming from the middle class.
[01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:23.409]  Those are the people losing value in their savings and in their assets.
[01:39:23.889 --> 01:39:27.991]  Yes, it's a vertical integration, a transference of wealth because they want control.
[01:39:28.151 --> 01:39:34.514]  But let me ask you this quickly, the caller from Georgia, Shanky, what made you finally wake up?
[01:39:35.375 --> 01:39:37.396]  The admissions of world government in the news?
[01:39:39.036 --> 01:39:41.558]  It's many things.
[01:39:41.678 --> 01:39:43.319]  I'm a financial person.
[01:39:43.459 --> 01:39:50.122]  I'm in the financial business and really seeing the fraud, seeing
[01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:59.409]  Seeing the financial fraud, seeing the manipulation of the markets, I've listened to you for years, but when you would talk about eugenics and stuff, I would just crack up.
[01:39:59.510 --> 01:40:02.071]  I'd say, you know, Alex, come on, let's get to something better than this.
[01:40:02.531 --> 01:40:15.879]  But now I'm starting to see it, and now the more I look into the vaccine issues and the really totally fascist state that we're becoming, we've skipped socialism in one broad step.
[01:40:16.779 --> 01:40:20.241]  And that realization, and I write
[01:40:21.209 --> 01:40:39.556]  I share some of your stuff, and I share wonderful websites like Zero Hedge and a few others that are more financially backed, but you've really brought me around and allowed me, Alex, which you probably might be most happy about, is to openly discuss this with people.
[01:40:40.036 --> 01:40:41.277]  Good, we have to do that.
[01:40:41.557 --> 01:40:43.058]  I've got to jump, but give us your blog.
[01:40:43.678 --> 01:40:44.678]  Let me say one more thing.
[01:40:44.698 --> 01:40:45.258]  I've got to go.
[01:40:45.318 --> 01:40:46.419]  G. Edwards has got to go right now.
[01:40:48.019 --> 01:40:49.180]  Just Google Shanky's blog.
[01:40:49.622 --> 01:40:50.643]  Okay, thank you so much.
[01:40:50.683 --> 01:40:51.303]  I appreciate it.
[01:40:51.323 --> 01:40:52.144]  You can call back again.
[01:40:52.524 --> 01:40:58.730]  G. Edward, thank you for spending so much time with us and hopefully I can come out and see you on December 12th when you're here in Austin.
[01:40:59.030 --> 01:41:01.592]  We really do appreciate you and God bless you.
[01:41:01.972 --> 01:41:02.753]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:41:02.773 --> 01:41:03.093]  Good luck.
[01:41:03.734 --> 01:41:04.755]  There goes G. Edward Griffin.
[01:41:05.075 --> 01:41:06.316]  I do want to just say this now.
[01:41:06.516 --> 01:41:09.579]  You can get, speaking of DVDs, Waking People Up.
[01:41:10.475 --> 01:41:12.176]  This really is the biggest solution.
[01:41:12.597 --> 01:41:16.660]  High-powered, well-produced, truthful films, they will wake people up.
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:24.386]  All the TV and media and lies and spin, that can be shattered by a single film that shows people the truth.
[01:41:24.426 --> 01:41:30.751]  Because people already subconsciously and intellectually knew the truth, they had never just consciously understood it.
[01:41:32.092 --> 01:41:35.475]  Alex Jones presents Reflections and Warnings, interview with Aaron Russo.
[01:41:36.115 --> 01:41:39.558]  While supplies last, with this printing,
[01:41:42.332 --> 01:41:49.013]  While supplies last of this, you can get one of these free, free 90-minute film with extras that are longer.
[01:41:50.453 --> 01:41:53.454]  You can get this film for free when you get Fall of the Republic.
[01:41:54.314 --> 01:41:58.255]  Fall of the Republic, regular price, in-game for $9.95, you get this free.
[01:41:58.475 --> 01:42:00.115]  We have a bunch of different combo deals.
[01:42:00.455 --> 01:42:02.135]  It also supports us and what we're doing here.
[01:42:02.175 --> 01:42:07.736]  You need to support alternative media, support organizations that are telling the truth, support people that are reaching out to others.
[01:42:08.456 --> 01:42:11.397]  Alex Jones presents Reflections and Warnings, an interview with Aaron Russo.
[01:42:12.017 --> 01:42:15.738]  You can get it free with a bunch of different films I'm offering right now.
[01:42:16.358 --> 01:42:18.599]  And here is the new cover for Fall of the Republic.
[01:42:18.619 --> 01:42:23.620]  In fact, give me a document cam over the head shot, because I want PrisonPlanet.tv members to be able to see this new cover.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.022]  Also, anybody can go to InfoWars.com, click on the banners for Fall of the Republic, and see the new cover.
[01:42:29.682 --> 01:42:32.523]  This is the limited edition, collector's edition, second cover.
[01:42:32.903 --> 01:42:35.064]  This will be now the cover for a while.
[01:42:35.104 --> 01:42:35.904]  I may change it again.
[01:42:35.924 --> 01:42:37.825]  We have another volume coming out next year.
[01:42:38.165 --> 01:42:40.266]  But this film is the most powerful film I've made.
[01:42:40.406 --> 01:42:41.186]  Please get it.
[01:42:41.526 --> 01:42:42.927]  Give it to your friends and family.
[01:42:42.967 --> 01:42:44.347]  You may already know all this material.
[01:42:44.888 --> 01:42:48.189]  But do you have a way to present it professionally to people?
[01:42:48.609 --> 01:42:50.290]  This is a handsome film.
[01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.990]  The cover is.
[01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:53.371]  The inside is even better.
[01:42:53.791 --> 01:42:54.051]  Get it.
[01:42:54.071 --> 01:42:56.492]  Get it to everybody you know for Christmas.
[01:42:57.932 --> 01:43:02.156]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[01:43:02.436 --> 01:43:06.520]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Siaga.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:17.170]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:19.252]  These key ingredients not only supply
[01:43:19.532 --> 01:43:20.152]  We're good to go.
[01:43:41.301 --> 01:43:44.443]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:44.463 --> 01:43:46.584]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:46.644 --> 01:43:48.165]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:08.502 --> 01:44:11.163]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:11.523 --> 01:44:17.386]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:17.546 --> 01:44:22.568]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[01:44:22.748 --> 01:44:25.910]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:32.733]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:34.955]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:35.195 --> 01:44:36.516]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:36.776 --> 01:44:39.038]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:39.238 --> 01:44:41.100]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.104]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:45:02.791 --> 01:45:04.011]  It's a scary world we live in.
[01:45:04.271 --> 01:45:08.392]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[01:45:08.652 --> 01:45:11.913]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[01:45:12.333 --> 01:45:19.694]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[01:45:20.134 --> 01:45:22.695]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.

[01:46:19.912 --> 01:46:22.975]  I want to thank some of the sponsors that made today's show possible briefly.
[01:46:23.416 --> 01:46:24.377]  Silver Lungs.
[01:46:24.818 --> 01:46:27.060]  I want to tell you about SilverLungs.com.
[01:46:27.601 --> 01:46:29.883]  SilverLungs.com.

[01:47:27.757 --> 01:47:30.137]  Hi Alex, I've been trying to get in touch with you for a couple of days.
[01:47:30.157 --> 01:47:34.758]  I wanted to let you know that I was one of the people that got arrested at Pelosi's office for ripping up the healthcare bill.
[01:47:57.754 --> 01:48:04.823]  And I just wanted to let everybody out there know that this is the last nail in the coffin for the United States.
[01:48:05.544 --> 01:48:10.110]  This healthcare bill is just a framework to plug in the massive eugenics policy against us.
[01:48:10.571 --> 01:48:13.174]  And we have to try, we have to fight.
[01:48:13.955 --> 01:48:22.280]  I want people, I mean, I'm asking people to go to their state capitals and protest at their senator's office because it's in the Senate now.
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:26.723]  They're saying that it's not going to go through, but they have the votes to let it go through.
[01:48:27.243 --> 01:48:33.087]  So, you know, I just say we have to give one big last push against this because it's so incredibly evil.
[01:48:33.902 --> 01:48:38.803]  Well, the health care bill's going up for a vote on November 17th.
[01:48:39.223 --> 01:48:40.604]  That's only five days away.
[01:48:40.684 --> 01:48:42.544]  That's next... What's the 17th?
[01:48:42.564 --> 01:48:44.484]  Is that next Wednesday or Thursday?
[01:48:45.165 --> 01:48:45.785]  I think it's Wednesday.
[01:48:45.805 --> 01:48:46.405]  I think it is.
[01:48:46.425 --> 01:48:49.606]  Yeah, so... And knowing them, they could launch it tomorrow.
[01:48:49.826 --> 01:48:51.326]  They're so deceptive and sneaky.
[01:48:52.166 --> 01:48:54.127]  I mean, this is a group of criminals.
[01:48:54.167 --> 01:48:54.867]  Thank you, Sue.
[01:48:55.287 --> 01:48:57.007]  Greg in Hawaii, last caller.
[01:48:57.027 --> 01:48:57.388]  Welcome.
[01:48:57.668 --> 01:48:58.428]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:48:58.848 --> 01:48:59.208]  Hey, buddy.
[01:49:00.583 --> 01:49:02.744]  Hey, I've got a visual aid for everyone.
[01:49:02.764 --> 01:49:04.105]  They probably have one already.
[01:49:05.026 --> 01:49:15.172]  What if all the truthers, the birthers, everyone that listens to your show, all the 9-12ers, what if we all flipped our flag for freedom?
[01:49:15.773 --> 01:49:17.214]  Would that wake a lot of people up?
[01:49:17.894 --> 01:49:19.755]  You're talking about flying the flag upside down?
[01:49:20.576 --> 01:49:21.056]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:21.096 --> 01:49:22.357]  We're a nation under distress.
[01:49:23.203 --> 01:49:39.335]  Well a lot of people do that and the cops come arrest them even though it's not illegal and it does get national attention and then you can explain why you did it because America's in a crisis and I think it certainly works but they come and fine you, fee you, arrest you, take it down, people get physically attacked because
[01:49:40.714 --> 01:49:43.256]  People don't know what flying the flag upside down means.
[01:49:43.436 --> 01:49:50.641]  And they don't care if foreign bankers rape America, or the dollar's plunging and their life's going to be destroyed financially.
[01:49:51.001 --> 01:49:54.144]  They care about kind of petty, transitory things.
[01:49:54.604 --> 01:49:56.986]  But yeah, I mean, I think it's a good idea to fly your flag upside down.
[01:49:57.026 --> 01:50:00.548]  We got a t-shirt that's got the flag upside down on it.
[01:50:00.588 --> 01:50:01.249]  It explains why.
[01:50:01.269 --> 01:50:06.072]  My message to everyone out there listening, flip your flag for freedom.
[01:50:06.632 --> 01:50:08.554]  And what do you think about the situation in Hawaii?
[01:50:08.574 --> 01:50:10.155]  Is it going to be alright over here?
[01:50:12.503 --> 01:50:13.644]  Gonna be alright with what?
[01:50:14.845 --> 01:50:17.347]  You know, the martial law and stuff, or are we in the same boat?
[01:50:18.028 --> 01:50:19.729]  It's all incremental martial law.
[01:50:20.150 --> 01:50:23.913]  When public schools are forcibly injecting kids, that's martial law.
[01:50:24.073 --> 01:50:26.095]  When you have troops on the street, that's martial law.
[01:50:26.215 --> 01:50:27.916]  When they have secret arrests, that's martial law.
[01:50:28.356 --> 01:50:29.217]  Thanks a lot, Greg.
[01:50:29.738 --> 01:50:32.300]  It's just what increment of martial law will we be under?
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:33.521]  Great job, crew.
[01:50:33.561 --> 01:50:34.682]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:34.862 --> 01:50:35.923]  Infowars.com.
