[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:01.369]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:04.110]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:15.872]  We are now simulcasting for the last hour and a few minutes at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:19.513]  The newly redesigned and updated PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.413]  Be sure and check it out.
[00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:23.554]  Bob Chapman is with us until the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:28.415]  Then I want to play a short extra for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.879]  Listeners on the radio will be able to hear the audio.
[00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:36.721]  It's also very effective in letting you know what's happening.
[00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:46.686]  Where they're breaking Christians' arms and federal courts ruled that they are allowed, the police are allowed to torture you and break bones as part of paying compliance.
[00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:49.308]  You don't get out of a car, they can break your arm.
[00:00:50.578 --> 00:00:51.178]  To make you do it.
[00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:55.400]  You don't get, uh, you're sitting out front of an abortion clinic, they can break your arm.
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.160]  The bone can stick out.
[00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:07.824]  Now they, YouTube lets you see the fake CIA beheading videos, which have been staged, with heads being sawed off, uh, but what they don't let you see is this.
[00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:09.885]  When this gets uploaded to YouTube, it gets taken down.
[00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:12.606]  Or they say adult content, and it gets blocked.
[00:01:13.186 --> 00:01:14.247]  So that is coming up.
[00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:16.310]  And I mean, all it is is breaking Americans' arms.
[00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:19.674]  And that's on TV all the time, you know.
[00:01:19.694 --> 00:01:21.516]  7 o'clock at night it's on, during the family hour.
[00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:22.818]  But this is real.
[00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:25.481]  You're going to see arms, compound fractures.
[00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:28.585]  And the police go, right in front of cameras, hey, no big deal.
[00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:29.927]  This is torture!
[00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:35.015]  So of course what's happening in Abu Ghraib is torture as well.
[00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:53.669]  I want to blitz through these calls, but Bob, specifically, I remember you saying it would go up like it did a few years ago and then back down, and you even said in a few months I see it going down to, you know, 66, and then I see it going up to 8,000, and then I see it going back down again, and you're even doing it month to month accurately.
[00:01:54.589 --> 00:02:00.895]  When will there be the big plunge, or will they just start hyperinflating in a year, and the stock market will reflect that?
[00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:05.519]  Maybe the stock market will be at, you know, not $15,000, but $100,000.
[00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.141]  It's just it won't be worth as much, or what's going to happen?
[00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:14.386]  Well, the market's going to go down, and we're not going to get a hypermarket.
[00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:15.767]  It just isn't going to happen.
[00:02:16.128 --> 00:02:21.032]  We'll get hyperinflation as soon as the money that was lent to the banks by the Fed
[00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.413]  That was then lent back and stored with the Fed is put into action.
[00:02:27.154 --> 00:02:29.956]  Now, right now, they're not using that money.
[00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:38.502]  They're keeping it on the balance sheet to ostensibly make themselves strong and receive about 1% interest for virtually doing nothing.
[00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:41.724]  And it's sort of like a wash sale.
[00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:49.109]  And so sooner or later, banks are going to have to use that money to keep the economy going.
[00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:50.649]  How far away is that?
[00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.949]  We don't know yet.
[00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.611]  Probably next year.
[00:02:55.631 --> 00:03:05.836]  But in the meantime, we're still going to have inflation because M3, which they don't publish anymore, is expanding at about 18% again.
[00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:08.598]  And in other countries, it's even higher.
[00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:10.219]  China's over 25%.
[00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:18.503]  And that money and credit that's being expanded by many major governments is going to cause
[00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:34.080]  Ongoing inflation and the money that is being created by the Fed and is being created through borrowing by the fiscal part of our government, which is our government looking for money to pay interest more than anything else.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.802]  And we're on the government because revenues are falling as well.
[00:03:38.522 --> 00:03:44.225]  And that is going to continue to push inflation higher again.
[00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:48.768]  And then once they take this money that banks have,
[00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:53.429]  Out of sterilization as it's called, then the thing will just go berserk.
[00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.794]  I can't put a timing on that yet, but it's going to happen.
[00:03:58.455 --> 00:04:01.778]  I'll see probably a month or two ahead when they're going to begin it.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.384]  But they haven't begun it as yet, and quite frankly I thought they would have.
[00:04:06.874 --> 00:04:15.280]  Well we're a year into this and you said it would take two or three years and most of the other people we talked to who are of your caliber, a researcher, are saying something similar.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.142]  So what, we're a year and a half out probably?
[00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:19.604]  Or you're saying it could come sooner?
[00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:24.988]  The chances are a year and a half out to two years.
[00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:29.470]  But it could come soon because of that untoward event I explained earlier.
[00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:32.113]  There are things that happen that nobody can control.
[00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:33.855]  Okay, one more point.
[00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:35.397]  Like China or somebody pulling out.
[00:04:35.897 --> 00:04:36.718]  And then we're going to call.
[00:04:36.758 --> 00:04:37.699]  I want your take on this.
[00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:39.638]  I don't know.
[00:04:56.073 --> 00:05:15.690]  It appears the move from the dollar, you know, they've gone to baskets and started buying a little bit of other stuff, but now China and others are buying gold, silver, copper, they're hoarding it all, and other countries, it appears we're now really starting to see the flight away from the dollar coinciding with this talk about a new world reserve currency with more G20 meetings coming up.
[00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:23.316]  All of that is true, and actually it's a flight from all currencies, because in Europe you have people buying
[00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:27.348]  Gold coins and bars, and they're not dealing in dollars, they're dealing in Euros.
[00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:36.952]  So you're seeing a flight to quality from all currencies, small at this time, but it'll grow larger.
[00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:49.218]  And that'll happen in an evolutionary process because all of the major countries, G20 and more, are making the same mistakes that we are, grasping at straws because the politicians
[00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.049]  Don't want to be around when the bomb falls out.
[00:05:52.069 --> 00:06:01.051]  So the Indian government, the Chinese government, the Russian government, the Japanese government, they're moving into precious metals across the board, including industrial metals like copper.
[00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:04.072]  You can just Google governments buying copper and it's a run on copper.
[00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:10.513]  There's a run to commodities, real commodities, and you're right, there's a flight from currencies globally.
[00:06:10.993 --> 00:06:15.354]  And so I guess they've got to kill the global currencies to bring in the real world currency.
[00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:20.999]  Well, and I don't think it's going to be SDRs because they've been unsuccessful before.
[00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:22.000]  They're backed by nothing.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.783]  And I think what they'll do is go for a basket of currencies and say that we're going to have gold backing when in fact they won't.
[00:06:30.404 --> 00:06:34.746]  And that's the way I think they're going to get away with trying to make their world currency.
[00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:39.648]  But because of programs like this, people are aware that this is what they're up to.
[00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:44.951]  And they're not going to let that happen in their country, whether it's Colombia or Bolivia or
[00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:53.018]  A global government setting the currency rates.
[00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:54.019]  Let's go to the calls here.
[00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:55.520]  Thanks for holding, Paul.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.680]  In Florida, you're on the air.
[00:06:58.301 --> 00:06:59.321]  Hi.
[00:07:00.242 --> 00:07:03.203]  Yeah, I've been in Infowars since 1981.
[00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:07.285]  My punk band from Florida is saying about everything that's happening right now.
[00:07:08.225 --> 00:07:10.086]  But I'm hard to keep on subject.
[00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:11.387]  I really appreciate your work.
[00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:13.868]  I just wanted to talk about
[00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:18.868]  What you mentioned early in the show, which is torture.
[00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.630]  You know, the Delta Force, they're like federal agents.
[00:07:24.331 --> 00:07:25.911]  They can dress however they like.
[00:07:27.612 --> 00:07:29.013]  They don't wear ranking badges.
[00:07:29.153 --> 00:07:31.294]  Yeah, they're under the National Security Council.
[00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:33.075]  That's Cheney's hit team.
[00:07:33.115 --> 00:07:33.995]  It's only Bush.
[00:07:34.335 --> 00:07:35.896]  No, it's been around for decades.
[00:07:36.196 --> 00:07:37.237]  It's still going on.
[00:07:37.617 --> 00:07:39.358]  And it's not even really part of the military, yes.
[00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:44.722]  Yeah, and I think it was them who moved into the World Trade Center to wire all the explosives.
[00:07:45.503 --> 00:07:51.207]  And I have an Army friend who was at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and he told me about how they choose their members.
[00:07:51.467 --> 00:08:06.218]  They look for sick, he thought they looked for sick, demented people who would confirm as yes-men and who get off on being plugged into the chain of command, you know, as if they were the top gun.
[00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:10.675]  I think that's an intelligent decision.
[00:08:10.795 --> 00:08:16.980]  I heard Limbaugh about ten years ago and then I confirmed it with the Delta Force and other groups, there's other secret groups after that.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:33.091]  They give them, after they've gone through all these months of training and the psychological warfare and all the tests, and all these guys have washed out, you know, from the Navy SEALs and Marine Force Recon and the Green Berets, you know, it's this joint deal.
[00:08:34.132 --> 00:08:37.154]  They then put them in a little shack with Machiavelli's The Prince.
[00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:40.698]  And they ask him to write an essay on it, just like they do high-level masons.
[00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:51.708]  And if they say, oh, I don't agree with Injustifies the Means and doing all these evil things for the greater good in the end, they go, oh, you don't pass, but we want you for something else.
[00:08:52.028 --> 00:08:57.914]  But if you say, oh, yes, I think doing evil for good is good, they say, that's it, you graduate.
[00:08:58.194 --> 00:09:00.837]  And then they do other psychological testing, but go ahead.
[00:09:01.687 --> 00:09:24.034]  Yeah, and so my idea is that what they're going to do is when they need a chain of command that's going to listen, they're going to put these guys in the chain of command just under the New World Order structure, and under them they're going to put a lot of the people they've recruited from the gangs, and then under them the foot soldiers, so that they'll try to keep what looks like a chain of command that's listening.
[00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:27.515]  And so there's a polarization.
[00:09:27.535 --> 00:09:30.496]  The good people like us, we're coming together, and they're coming together under power just
[00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:35.928]  In the cities, people and gangs come together for power, and this only safe place would be in the woods.
[00:09:35.988 --> 00:09:38.649]  Now, there's the erase, and then there's the rewrite.
[00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:41.650]  We know this whole system might fall apart and break down.
[00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:57.954]  It's what we do after that, right on the moment, to keep civil society together, protect our children, protect the family unit, and I worked extensively on what could happen and possibly dare, and even had visions and visits from angelic forces, you know,
[00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.532]  While in hermitage for a year, prayer on this.
[00:10:02.712 --> 00:10:03.832]  Anyway, back to the thing.
[00:10:04.092 --> 00:10:05.473]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:10:05.513 --> 00:10:05.953]  That's interesting.
[00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:07.734]  You ought to write an article about that, sir.
[00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:10.815]  You sound like an interesting person.
[00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:14.877]  Going back to Bob Chapman, that's the big goal of the elite.
[00:10:14.897 --> 00:10:15.857]  They're totally ruthless.
[00:10:15.917 --> 00:10:20.059]  Once you commit all this evil, the next evil, it's no big deal.
[00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:23.460]  It's like I've said, I won't do anything immoral.
[00:10:26.474 --> 00:10:29.155]  I know that if I'm going to be evil, I might as well just go all the way.
[00:10:29.315 --> 00:10:30.735]  And I know where that leads, I don't want to do it.
[00:10:31.616 --> 00:10:37.658]  But the government's problem is they're always trying to find people that'll do what they're told and to test them, then they don't trust each other.
[00:10:37.698 --> 00:10:48.181]  That's why they had all the biological, chemical, radiological testing, killing innocent troops and children and foster kids, it's all declassified, was to create cadres of scientists
[00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:50.562]  Absolutely, and they even have them categorized.
[00:10:50.582 --> 00:10:52.663]  What's the best place for this person to be?
[00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:24.631]  As long as the person is pliable, they can use them almost anywhere that their talents fit.
[00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:26.291]  And that's what these people do.
[00:11:28.612 --> 00:11:29.032]  Amazing.
[00:11:29.072 --> 00:11:31.252]  Bob, I want to come back and finish up with the economy and then let you go.
[00:11:31.272 --> 00:11:32.213]  Then I'll continue with the calls.
[00:11:32.313 --> 00:11:33.613]  And a big news blitz.
[00:11:33.933 --> 00:11:36.154]  I mean, I've never seen such attacks on the First Amendment.
[00:11:36.414 --> 00:11:41.675]  And I've kind of gotten conditioned seeing these build up the last year where I'm not even screaming bloody murder like I should.
[00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:44.316]  Because they just do it creeping death.
[00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:44.956]  Creeping death.
[00:11:46.152 --> 00:11:49.141]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:11:49.282 --> 00:11:51.890]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.374]  We are live!
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.323]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[00:12:00.603 --> 00:12:05.227]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[00:12:05.507 --> 00:12:07.929]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:13.333]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.
[00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:22.440]  The bailout group can help cut your debt by up to 60% of its original value, removing those high interest fees and rolling everything into one low monthly payment.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.401]  And the best part?
[00:12:23.721 --> 00:12:28.204]  All GCN listeners qualify for a free 5-minute debt relief consultation.
[00:12:28.384 --> 00:12:31.986]  This is the system that credit card companies don't want you to know about.
[00:12:32.226 --> 00:12:36.509]  This is a fast, proven, and legal process for your credit card debt concerns.
[00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:38.450]  Call the bailout group now at 800-324-6554.
[00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:38.670]  That's 800-324-6554.
[00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.251]  Debt relief experts are standing by.
[00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:42.073]  You have nothing to lose, except your credit card debt.
[00:12:42.113 --> 00:12:42.313]  Call 800-324-6554.
[00:12:52.199 --> 00:13:02.065]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:09.549]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:10.131 --> 00:13:16.374]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:18.556]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:18.696 --> 00:13:21.117]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:21.197 --> 00:13:32.143]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:34.060]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.762]  It's about a one world government.
[00:13:36.302 --> 00:13:42.667]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:13:51.475 --> 00:13:52.635]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:54.237]  The people strike back.
[00:13:56.343 --> 00:13:59.605]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:13:59.785 --> 00:14:03.867]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:14:04.047 --> 00:14:15.473]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:14:15.693 --> 00:14:21.536]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:14:21.776 --> 00:14:22.397]  We're good to go.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.020]  We're good.
[00:14:57.518 --> 00:14:59.499]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.843]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[00:15:58.634 --> 00:16:03.397]  Okay, let's go right back to Bob Chapman, then your calls are coming up, and then I'm going to get into this torture video.
[00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:12.642]  And the latest, where the government's saying, oh, the CIA was following orders, so it's okay, they tortured.
[00:16:12.662 --> 00:16:14.103]  This is an incredible precedent.
[00:16:14.584 --> 00:16:20.748]  He's not rebuking torture, he's confirming it all, and saying, hey, what the Nazis did was good.
[00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:23.509]  Nuremberg found him guilty.
[00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:25.891]  They said, no, just because you're told to follow an order that's illegal,
[00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.673]  You know, it doesn't matter if the government says it's okay.
[00:16:29.753 --> 00:16:32.056]  It's illegal against the common law of humanity.
[00:16:32.397 --> 00:16:33.418]  You will be held accountable.
[00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:35.040]  Well, Obama says no.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.263]  We told him to do it, so they're good guys.
[00:16:38.324 --> 00:16:39.406]  Yeah, I bet they're good guys.
[00:16:39.646 --> 00:16:41.428]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up for just two or three minutes.
[00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:42.009]  We're going to come back.
[00:16:43.286 --> 00:16:46.568]  And go to your calls, as I said, while we have Bob Chapman.
[00:16:46.928 --> 00:16:50.909]  Ted, I wanted to drag you on here because you told me it was a really hot item, and I know why.
[00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.811]  These things are really rare out there.
[00:16:53.831 --> 00:16:55.812]  I know they go for a lot on eBay and places.
[00:16:56.392 --> 00:17:00.174]  People can't get a regular silver dollar for less than $19.20 online.
[00:17:01.314 --> 00:17:04.315]  And Ted's got silver dollars, you know, for less than that.
[00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:11.519]  But he also has these Lakota Nation Rounds, which are put out by the Native American New Nation that's declared sovereignty.
[00:17:12.379 --> 00:17:17.680]  And these are really a hot item, and Ted has them way, way less than you'll find them any other place.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.621]  In fact, Ted, you bought them in so much bulk, and you're passing that savings on to folks.
[00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:26.042]  I mean, this is what, a 20-30% discount from where it's being sold other places?
[00:17:26.302 --> 00:17:26.702]  Oh, yeah.
[00:17:26.902 --> 00:17:31.363]  I see these things as high as $50, some places even $100.
[00:17:31.403 --> 00:17:36.665]  And if you're shopping on eBay, they're about $20 to $25.
[00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.929]  Yeah, I
[00:17:58.268 --> 00:18:06.233]  Claiming sovereignty and getting into the Federal Reserve space, to me, is enough to support him right there.
[00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:10.836]  Well, we also know the Feds raided the Liberty Dollar and they had all the gold and silver there and were shipping it out.
[00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:13.738]  And that coin went from $15 a piece to $500, $300.
[00:18:13.998 --> 00:18:19.302]  I mean, that's one of the biggest collectors out there, is that Ron Paul Liberty thing.
[00:18:19.322 --> 00:18:21.743]  So I think you've got a train wreck.
[00:18:21.763 --> 00:18:24.205]  People looking for a train wreck here is another reason.
[00:18:25.685 --> 00:18:33.047]  You've got it basically below what silver dollars that are junk are selling for, so it's an insanely good deal.
[00:18:33.587 --> 00:18:36.088]  How good of a deal is that, Bob Chapman?
[00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:38.628]  Very good deal.
[00:18:39.448 --> 00:18:43.629]  Whatever you can buy an ounce at that price in this market today.
[00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:50.291]  And you know, Ted will tell you how difficult it is to get dimes and quarters and halves
[00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:59.557]  Yeah, there's no way you can touch a Silver Eagle at this price right now, Alex.
[00:18:59.637 --> 00:19:01.177]  And Bob's right about that.
[00:19:01.197 --> 00:19:09.479]  I mean, the silver dollars, the dimes, the halves, the quarters, all that stuff is in such short supply, there's many times where I can't even sell them.
[00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:11.000]  And that goes for months on end.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.800]  I mean, here I have this coin.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.561]  It's a good, as far as I'm concerned, a good cause.
[00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:20.002]  And you're going to get an ounce of silver at a price that I think is
[00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:22.070]  Absolutely out of this world.
[00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.331]  And you get that Lakota Nation coin.
[00:19:26.251 --> 00:19:28.332]  I don't know how you can lose on this particular one.
[00:19:28.392 --> 00:19:29.233]  It's a win-win situation.
[00:19:29.253 --> 00:19:29.733]  Absolutely not.
[00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:31.734]  Ted, you've got gold at really good prices, too.
[00:19:31.814 --> 00:19:32.834]  Tell folks about that real quick.
[00:19:32.854 --> 00:19:33.975]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:34.015 --> 00:19:37.676]  I mean, the Franks right now are at $213, and we've got the British Sovereigns at $265.
[00:19:37.836 --> 00:19:40.217]  I mean, we've got U.S.
[00:19:40.297 --> 00:19:42.138]  Eagles, all this stuff.
[00:19:42.198 --> 00:19:44.459]  I mean, because the prices right now in gold and silver
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.321]  I don't know.
[00:19:58.703 --> 00:19:59.923]  Right now you can buy this stuff.
[00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:01.864]  It's deeply discounted to where it was.
[00:20:01.884 --> 00:20:08.166]  And all weekend, folks are going to be there at Minus Resources until midnight every night.
[00:20:08.186 --> 00:20:08.346]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:08.366 --> 00:20:08.686]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:08.706 --> 00:20:12.407]  And I want to ask Darth Vader, Bob Chapman there, beating up his telephone.
[00:20:12.427 --> 00:20:16.228]  Bob, how good a deal is that on the gold, and should folks buy into it now?
[00:20:27.698 --> 00:20:35.021]  It's an excellent deal because prices have come down and no one knows for sure where gold is going to go.
[00:20:35.181 --> 00:20:36.302]  I think it's going higher.
[00:20:36.962 --> 00:20:42.765]  It's testing its 200 day moving average right now and it will be interesting to see if it holds.
[00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:43.525]  I think it will.
[00:20:44.325 --> 00:20:47.587]  As Ted and I have discussed on the air before,
[00:20:48.383 --> 00:20:50.705]  People always want to buy when the price is going up.
[00:20:52.027 --> 00:20:54.689]  The best time to buy is when the price is corrected.
[00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.372]  And we've come down from $9.60 recently twice.
[00:20:57.432 --> 00:21:00.495]  And at $8.70 this is a good deal.
[00:21:05.479 --> 00:21:08.101]  Because the prices are much cheaper than they were before.
[00:21:08.181 --> 00:21:10.863]  Well, plus, that's a month-to-month graph.
[00:21:10.883 --> 00:21:14.686]  You look at the 5-year, the 10-year, the 1-year, gold's going straight up.
[00:21:15.246 --> 00:21:16.947]  And everything else is going straight down.
[00:21:16.967 --> 00:21:17.588]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:17.628 --> 00:21:26.354]  Don't forget to get a free copy of The International Forecaster at TheInternationalForecaster.com.

[00:21:29.276 --> 00:21:30.977]  Gentlemen, both of you have a great weekend.
[00:21:31.177 --> 00:21:32.659]  We'll talk to you again both next week.
[00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:34.180]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:21:34.761 --> 00:21:35.581]  Thank you both, gentlemen.
[00:21:35.802 --> 00:21:36.983]  Okay, I'm gonna blitz through your calls.
[00:21:37.003 --> 00:21:37.964]  You've been holding long enough.
[00:21:38.304 --> 00:21:39.566]  Straight ahead on the other side.
[00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:42.709]  Then, another huge blitz of news and information.
[00:21:42.729 --> 00:21:43.630]  Stay with us.
[00:21:46.593 --> 00:21:47.514]  We're on the march.
[00:21:47.995 --> 00:21:49.597]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:53.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:59.480]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:21:59.641 --> 00:22:04.843]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:22:05.163 --> 00:22:10.506]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:22:10.886 --> 00:22:12.006]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:21.271]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:23.313]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:22:23.513 --> 00:22:27.678]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:22:56.957 --> 00:23:02.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:02.982 --> 00:23:08.325]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:15.048]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:15.368 --> 00:23:17.189]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:19.730]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:30.616]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:32.967 --> 00:23:34.228]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:34.649 --> 00:23:35.990]  It's about a one world government.
[00:23:36.511 --> 00:23:42.858]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:51.687 --> 00:23:52.828]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:53.248 --> 00:23:54.450]  The people strike back.
[00:23:56.118 --> 00:23:57.639]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:23:57.819 --> 00:23:59.280]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.801]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:06.983]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:10.225]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:14.067]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:24:14.477 --> 00:24:26.464]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system, which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:24:27.024 --> 00:24:29.006]  Finally, drinking water that you control.

[00:24:30.747 --> 00:24:33.208]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:24:33.468 --> 00:24:34.189]  We're good to go.
[00:25:07.427 --> 00:25:10.471]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:25:10.491 --> 00:25:13.394]  Run on for a long time.
[00:25:14.075 --> 00:25:16.178]  Run on for a long time.
[00:25:16.899 --> 00:25:19.342]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:25:19.902 --> 00:25:22.345]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:33.406]  Go tell that long-tongue liar, go and tell that midnight rider, tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter.
[00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:36.848]  Alright, Phillip in Illinois, the Dino, Steve, Mark, Bethany.
[00:25:36.888 --> 00:25:39.429]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Phillip.
[00:25:43.171 --> 00:25:44.292]  Are you there, Phillip?
[00:25:44.432 --> 00:25:46.413]  Okay, let him go.
[00:25:46.453 --> 00:25:47.734]  Let's go to Dino in Oregon.
[00:25:47.754 --> 00:25:49.135]  Dino in Oregon, you're on the air.
[00:25:49.195 --> 00:25:49.495]  Welcome.
[00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.131]  Hey AJ, thanks for taking my call.
[00:25:52.231 --> 00:25:54.593]  You are a household name here in our home.
[00:25:56.033 --> 00:26:00.176]  Every day we listen to you because it is a gathering place of our peeps.
[00:26:01.797 --> 00:26:03.638]  Liberty people out there in America.
[00:26:03.658 --> 00:26:05.419]  Every time I hear a caller I get excited.
[00:26:05.959 --> 00:26:12.143]  I love it when female callers call because you can see the spark of liberty that we need in that female side.
[00:26:12.844 --> 00:26:14.765]  And you know, I woke up to you just after 2001, September 11th.
[00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.454]  I was listening to my roommate on the internet.
[00:26:20.514 --> 00:26:22.676]  He was listening to some guy scream and yell.
[00:26:22.736 --> 00:26:24.098]  And I thought, this guy's Christian.
[00:26:24.118 --> 00:26:24.519]  He's nuts.
[00:26:24.579 --> 00:26:25.760]  I don't want to listen to this crap.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.442]  But he said, sit down and watch this film.
[00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:29.104]  So I watched 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:32.247]  And it woke me up to Oklahoma City, which is right there in your face.
[00:26:32.287 --> 00:26:36.150]  And I thought, how could this be right there in your face, and no one's doing anything about it?
[00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.972]  And then I looked into 9-11, and then so on and so forth.
[00:26:39.012 --> 00:26:39.632]  I've read every document.
[00:26:39.652 --> 00:26:42.334]  And see, all of that just sets a precedent for the elite.
[00:26:42.654 --> 00:26:45.116]  If they get away with doing Oklahoma City, why not 9-11?
[00:26:45.336 --> 00:26:49.619]  If they get away with torture, again, they're setting a precedent to continue all of this.
[00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:55.423]  And the end justifies the means is a theme that I see throughout, from the lower levels all the way up.
[00:26:55.982 --> 00:26:57.263]  I've got rid of our television.
[00:26:57.303 --> 00:26:59.263]  We got rid of cable because that's the same thing.
[00:26:59.343 --> 00:27:00.424]  Injustified the means.
[00:27:00.724 --> 00:27:04.025]  They spread pedophilia all over ABC, Disney.
[00:27:04.085 --> 00:27:04.966]  It's disgusting.
[00:27:04.986 --> 00:27:06.526]  You can't even go to the store anymore.
[00:27:06.946 --> 00:27:10.067]  So I'm just saying people, we have to listen to Professor Alex.
[00:27:10.148 --> 00:27:11.168]  You are like our
[00:27:11.758 --> 00:27:18.883]  Daily class in liberty, but then once we're done listening to you, we need to get out there and talk to people and spread the message to everyone you talk to.
[00:27:19.063 --> 00:27:20.084]  Well, I want to say this.
[00:27:20.104 --> 00:27:20.845]  I want to say this.
[00:27:20.865 --> 00:27:23.987]  We're all teachers and we're all students together here.
[00:27:24.147 --> 00:27:24.407]  Yes.
[00:27:24.947 --> 00:27:26.409]  You know, you're a professor.
[00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:27.289]  I'm a teacher.
[00:27:27.489 --> 00:27:28.170]  I'm a learner.
[00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:28.890]  I'm a student.
[00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:37.737]  You know, all of us are symbiotically learning from each other, developing the information, studying the enemy's operations, how they control populations.
[00:27:38.057 --> 00:27:39.478]  We're doing all this together right now.
[00:27:40.174 --> 00:27:43.315]  Once we know the truth, too, people don't be afraid to just talk.
[00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:44.375]  It'll come out of your mouth.
[00:27:44.415 --> 00:27:45.376]  It'll come out of your brain.
[00:27:45.396 --> 00:27:46.316]  Jesse Ventura said it.
[00:27:46.616 --> 00:27:48.337]  When you're speaking the truth, it just comes.
[00:27:48.497 --> 00:27:49.557]  I don't need notes.
[00:27:49.697 --> 00:27:51.998]  I know the places and times and faces.
[00:27:52.458 --> 00:27:53.299]  I know what's going on in the world.
[00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:53.459]  Exactly.
[00:27:53.479 --> 00:27:53.899]  Look at Obama.
[00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:56.080]  Everywhere he goes, they got teleprompters.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:02.242]  People notice that, so they move big jumbotrons back behind him so they can read it from far away, and then ask the media not to show them.
[00:28:02.262 --> 00:28:02.942]  That's on record.
[00:28:03.382 --> 00:28:06.303]  Because people are like, he's not just saying it from the heart.
[00:28:06.763 --> 00:28:08.564]  No, it's all scripted.
[00:28:08.904 --> 00:28:12.246]  It's all been analyzed psychologically to manipulate.
[00:28:12.306 --> 00:28:13.366]  It's all deception.
[00:28:14.307 --> 00:28:16.307]  And the truth comes out no matter where we put it.
[00:28:16.347 --> 00:28:17.568]  You can post it on Craigslist.
[00:28:17.921 --> 00:28:26.905]  The truth is now, and I tell people, I even go to bands after they're playing and they sit down and I say, you know, one of the hottest messages right now is the Liberty message and I talk about the New World Order and they get it.
[00:28:27.025 --> 00:28:30.367]  If you explain it right, people get it and they know they've been fooled.
[00:28:30.407 --> 00:28:34.509]  This whole socialism and communism and socialism are the same thing.
[00:28:34.589 --> 00:28:35.149]  We know that.
[00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:36.470]  And the next step is
[00:28:37.014 --> 00:28:37.574]  Fascism.
[00:28:37.634 --> 00:28:39.776]  And we can't stand to let that happen.
[00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:40.336]  Exactly.
[00:28:40.457 --> 00:28:45.700]  And they confuse you and act like fascism and socialism and all this isn't interconnected, where it comes from the same place.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.101]  Great.
[00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:47.101]  Call Dino.
[00:28:47.542 --> 00:28:48.322]  Good to hear from you.
[00:28:48.362 --> 00:28:49.123]  Steve in Tennessee.
[00:28:49.143 --> 00:28:49.743]  You're on the air.
[00:28:52.585 --> 00:28:53.206]  Go ahead, Steve.
[00:28:53.226 --> 00:28:53.766]  You're on the air.
[00:28:53.786 --> 00:28:55.387]  Hey, how's it going, buddy?
[00:28:55.668 --> 00:28:56.008]  Good, sir.
[00:28:56.028 --> 00:28:56.688]  Good to hear from you.
[00:28:57.369 --> 00:28:59.530]  This is Steve Norris, another brother.
[00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:02.452]  I'm sure, well, possibly you've heard my name before.
[00:29:03.313 --> 00:29:05.034]  Dino, pretty well hit the nail on the head.
[00:29:06.553 --> 00:29:07.994]  You had a good call in there.
[00:29:09.415 --> 00:29:13.878]  Getting your name out is our objective.
[00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:14.959]  That's what has to happen.
[00:29:15.939 --> 00:29:18.181]  Vistaprint.com is cheap.
[00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:24.145]  You can literally get 10,000 business cards with whatever you want on them for a little over $100.
[00:29:24.245 --> 00:29:26.906]  And getting the word out.
[00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:28.647]  Talking to strangers.
[00:29:29.048 --> 00:29:29.788]  Whatever it takes.
[00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.012]  In my opinion, the people must create their own G20.
[00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:37.788]  Uh, communicate with other G20s.
[00:29:38.028 --> 00:29:40.169]  You know, that's a way to come across.
[00:29:41.089 --> 00:29:42.269]  You know, get to know your neighbors.
[00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.810]  Go out and talk to them.
[00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.772]  What they want is everybody to stay to themselves.
[00:29:48.832 --> 00:29:50.072]  Be scared of who to talk to.
[00:29:50.192 --> 00:29:52.213]  You know, divide and conquer.
[00:29:53.353 --> 00:29:55.654]  That's their agenda, and we've got to fight that.
[00:29:56.975 --> 00:29:58.135]  You know, talk to your neighbors.
[00:29:58.175 --> 00:29:58.976]  Talk to strangers.
[00:30:01.929 --> 00:30:02.910]  That's what I've been doing.
[00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:08.775]  I've passed out literally tens of thousands of cards with all the information on them.
[00:30:10.096 --> 00:30:12.438]  I don't know how many DVDs I've done.
[00:30:12.758 --> 00:30:13.258]  Thousands.
[00:30:13.538 --> 00:30:14.900]  Well, it's having a huge effect.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.323]  We've got Rick Perry, the Bilderberg Group member, coming out saying, I'm going to fight tyranny.
[00:30:19.543 --> 00:30:20.564]  We may secede.
[00:30:21.045 --> 00:30:22.486]  And I told folks it was just a stunt.
[00:30:22.526 --> 00:30:24.327]  He's now admitting he was just, quote, joking.
[00:30:24.808 --> 00:30:29.131]  But the point is, Sean Hannity's saying the conspiracy people are right about a new world order.
[00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:31.013]  Glenn Beck's having to do it because
[00:30:31.573 --> 00:30:37.016]  They're having to at least pay lip service because we are the majority now of thinkers.
[00:30:37.056 --> 00:30:39.317]  You've got the majority that aren't informed and don't care.
[00:30:39.577 --> 00:30:43.739]  But of people awake, you know, to the political system, we are now the majority.
[00:30:43.779 --> 00:30:44.840]  We've just got to act like it.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.442]  And, sir, it's because of people like you and what you're out there doing.
[00:30:48.482 --> 00:30:49.242]  So I salute you.
[00:30:50.222 --> 00:30:51.063]  I appreciate that.
[00:30:51.163 --> 00:30:57.206]  And what we have to do, Alex, is the in-your-face operative, just like they're doing to us.
[00:30:57.808 --> 00:30:58.968]  They do the in-your-face.
[00:30:59.168 --> 00:31:00.509]  That's exactly how they operate.
[00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:01.589]  That's what we need to do back.
[00:31:02.129 --> 00:31:05.730]  We've got to wake up people and kind of make them understand.
[00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.011]  We're all on the same goal here.
[00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:09.871]  It's for our children.
[00:31:10.111 --> 00:31:11.692]  It doesn't have anything to do with me or you.
[00:31:11.712 --> 00:31:13.913]  It has everything to do with our children and grandchildren.
[00:31:14.273 --> 00:31:22.155]  It's what's going to be the success of this country and our sovereignty and being independent and having the freedom of being able to have the American Dream.
[00:31:23.075 --> 00:31:23.975]  We're separate.
[00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:26.236]  We're different from any other country in this world.
[00:31:26.816 --> 00:31:31.378]  And the only way we're going to keep that is to wake up now and make things happen.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.160]  Truth is what it is.
[00:31:40.112 --> 00:31:43.614]  Um, remember a couple weeks ago it was announced they were going to have regular Army-run checkpoints.
[00:31:43.634 --> 00:31:44.815]  We had a state rep on.
[00:31:45.396 --> 00:31:46.316]  He talked to the Governor.
[00:31:47.017 --> 00:31:50.099]  Yeah, the Governor came out and said, we're not going to do this.
[00:31:50.579 --> 00:31:56.503]  And then I got the Marion County News and other newspapers, and they just came out and said, well, the Army did it anyways.
[00:31:56.843 --> 00:31:58.184]  The Air Force MPs.
[00:31:58.784 --> 00:32:00.746]  And it describes, um,
[00:32:01.932 --> 00:32:17.322]  How they shut down the highway on Interstate 24 eastbound, mile marker 135, and how the Army was out there, and how they were out there searching everybody, and it's got, here's the base police, off base with a dog, searching Americans.
[00:32:18.022 --> 00:32:21.204]  I mean, can you believe the Governor told them not to do it, and they just did it anyways?
[00:32:21.224 --> 00:32:22.725]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[00:32:22.785 --> 00:32:27.308]  Again, what I'm saying, it's in your face, operatives.
[00:32:27.348 --> 00:32:28.989]  That's how they operate, that's what they do.
[00:32:29.562 --> 00:32:31.824]  And all the way we're going to beat these people is by numbers.
[00:32:31.984 --> 00:32:34.285]  We have to, we have to operate in numbers.
[00:32:34.466 --> 00:32:40.690]  We have to, you know, target, I tell you, something I have here is very fortunate.
[00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:45.594]  This particular area is home to a lot of major business owners.
[00:32:45.934 --> 00:32:50.857]  Pallet Oil Corporation, BP, British Petroleum, Goody's, for example.
[00:32:51.158 --> 00:32:53.399]  There's a lot of major business owners in this area.
[00:32:53.699 --> 00:32:57.462]  And I'm the type, I walk straight up in and I'll talk to whoever.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:10.529]  And when you get major business owners involved who have a lot of capital, capital's on our side, and they need to spend it while they can, while the green's still good.
[00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:13.752]  They're upset.
[00:33:14.653 --> 00:33:18.836]  They don't tell everybody how they're feeling when they're feeling it, because they're business owners.
[00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:21.398]  They can't exploit their feelings.
[00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.712]  But you got to bring it out of them.
[00:33:39.557 --> 00:33:49.164]  In the first hour I went over the dark seduction, how the new rule order brings people into evil, how they leaked the torture on purpose, how they bragged they were torturing children.
[00:33:49.885 --> 00:33:56.229]  And then now they release the White House memos about how Bush wanted to be a dictator and ban free speech and ban the media.
[00:33:56.649 --> 00:34:00.892]  Then I have mainstream news, LA Times, coming out and saying, oh yeah,
[00:34:01.713 --> 00:34:09.620]  The only way to save the newspapers is to basically ban other people and not let them say they're reporters and have the government license reporters.
[00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:13.924]  So, I've got all this free speech news I want to go over.
[00:34:13.944 --> 00:34:15.886]  I'm going to go over that with Raleigh James coming up.
[00:34:16.547 --> 00:34:17.988]  But more of your calls will come up in a moment.
[00:34:18.048 --> 00:34:25.875]  Right now, I wanted to play for radio listeners, you know, you'll be able to hear the audio, but for prisonpanda.tv viewers,
[00:34:26.877 --> 00:34:34.862]  This is the extra, one of the extras from my three-hour film, 9-1-1, Martial Law, Rise of the Police State.
[00:34:34.882 --> 00:34:40.345]  It's really three films, so it's 9-1-1, Martial Law, Rise of the... Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:34:40.625 --> 00:34:42.026]  Made so many films, can't remember the names of them.
[00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:47.749]  But this is really one of my better films, and really breaks... You watch this one film, you basically get the whole picture.
[00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:50.117]  This is the very end.
[00:34:50.397 --> 00:34:55.520]  The credits have Bush giving his cryptic speech about a dark cult of evil that thrives off human suffering.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.641]  He's talking about his own people.
[00:34:57.781 --> 00:34:59.582]  And then it goes into the extras.
[00:34:59.642 --> 00:35:00.983]  The first extra dealing with torture.
[00:35:01.003 --> 00:35:02.424]  We're going to play just a few minutes of this.
[00:35:03.645 --> 00:35:06.967]  And then we'll continue with your calls and Raleigh James, syndicated talk show host.
[00:35:07.287 --> 00:35:07.847]  Never heard her.
[00:35:07.887 --> 00:35:08.268]  Get ready.
[00:35:08.288 --> 00:35:09.048]  She's a great lady.
[00:35:09.388 --> 00:35:09.969]  Very informative.
[00:35:09.989 --> 00:35:11.249]  One of the people that helped wake me up.
[00:35:11.269 --> 00:35:12.910]  I used to listen to her in college.
[00:35:14.588 --> 00:35:17.831]  Back when I was trying to get into radio and TV, I was listening to her when she was in Austin.
[00:35:18.271 --> 00:35:35.987]  But let's go ahead and play part of my film, Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State, going out of the credits into the first extra, where they are breaking pro-lifers sitting in front of buildings, doors, or on the sidewalk, and they say, get up and walk.
[00:35:36.047 --> 00:35:36.728]  Oh, you won't get up and walk?
[00:35:36.748 --> 00:35:37.669]  I'm going to break your arm.
[00:35:38.973 --> 00:35:40.094]  And see, that's what the taser is.
[00:35:40.234 --> 00:35:41.095]  Oh, don't tase me, bro.
[00:35:41.335 --> 00:35:44.018]  Oh, you shouldn't ask the question of Kerry.
[00:35:44.378 --> 00:35:46.060]  We're now going to taser you as punishment.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.022]  See, a taser's fine for protection for an officer.
[00:35:49.263 --> 00:35:54.808]  But when they're, oh, you didn't walk the yellow line when I gave you an order, bzzz, you know, that's what it's now being used for.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.000]  Or pregnant women.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:57.640]  You argue with me.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.420]  You didn't move quick enough.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.181]  You didn't get up off a park bench fast enough.
[00:36:00.821 --> 00:36:03.521]  Well, again, they call this pain compliance.
[00:36:03.621 --> 00:36:04.602]  Pressure compliance.
[00:36:05.502 --> 00:36:09.863]  This is one of the extras from my film, 9-1-1.
[00:36:12.623 --> 00:36:13.123]  Martial law.
[00:36:13.143 --> 00:36:13.443]  9-1-1.
[00:36:13.483 --> 00:36:14.163]  Rise of the police state.
[00:36:14.183 --> 00:36:14.484]  Here it is.
[00:36:15.764 --> 00:36:21.845]  Behind them is a cult of evil, which seeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human suffering.
[00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:34.068]  To purchase additional copies of this film, or to see dozens of other films and important books, be sure and visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:34.448 --> 00:36:40.813]  I forgot there was this ad in between it.
[00:36:40.833 --> 00:36:40.973]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:41.133 --> 00:36:46.417]  Alright, here's the extras, because they've kind of got it in the playthrough modes.
[00:36:46.477 --> 00:36:47.097]  I'm going to the extras.
[00:36:52.161 --> 00:36:53.302]  Again, this is from my film.
[00:36:54.727 --> 00:36:57.088]  Marshall Law 9-1-1, rise of the police state.
[00:36:57.728 --> 00:36:58.908]  Here it is, the extras.
[00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:12.912]  The globalists have been systematically engaging in a massive brainwashing campaign, telling the public that torture is a good idea.
[00:37:13.552 --> 00:37:15.973]  And now we've seen the aftermath of torture.
[00:37:16.393 --> 00:37:23.395]  The Joseph Mingala style abuses include killing detainees and harvesting their organs.
[00:37:24.435 --> 00:37:26.516]  But they don't just torture people to death.
[00:37:26.976 --> 00:37:30.817]  They do things so horrible we can't even mention them here.
[00:37:31.137 --> 00:37:41.881]  And there's no mystery when it comes to finding out who ordered all of this ultra-brutal torture at Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay and Gitmo and 32 other camps in Iraq.
[00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:47.483]  Alberto Gonzales and Chertoff and the rest of Bush's crew.
[00:37:48.383 --> 00:37:55.650]  Openly wrote memos detailing how torturing people unto death is an okay thing to do.
[00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.331]  It's part of the public record.
[00:37:57.431 --> 00:37:59.653]  The White House and Pentagon ordered the torture.
[00:38:00.014 --> 00:38:03.197]  But when they got caught, they just burned a few of their underlings.
[00:38:04.502 --> 00:38:11.788]  The Pentagon's own reports admit that 90% of those that were picked up at checkpoints in Iraq were totally innocent.
[00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:14.290]  But that didn't stop them from being tortured.
[00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:30.863]  In fact, the Army's own report admits that military dogs were used to bite and frighten detainees, that women were brutally raped, that detainees were beaten to death and sodomized with large objects dripping with battery acid.
[00:38:31.363 --> 00:38:35.867]  People's children were also raped in front of them to attain answers.
[00:38:36.468 --> 00:38:40.452]  This is the same type of mentality we see from serial killers.
[00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:44.916]  And it's riddled with all sorts of perverted sexual abuse.
[00:38:45.477 --> 00:38:49.160]  Is this what the land of the free and the home of the brave has become?
[00:38:50.194 --> 00:38:56.740]  After 13 years of sanctions, over a million and a half Iraqis died, 700,000 of them children.
[00:38:57.301 --> 00:39:10.434]  And now thousands of private contractors have taken over the torture where the Pentagon left off, following in the footsteps of other famous control freak serial killers and torturers.
[00:39:10.874 --> 00:39:18.697]  The only reason the elite is selling us on torture is because they want to condition us to where we will accept its use against us.
[00:39:19.197 --> 00:39:26.099]  And it's been going on for decades in America, in the prisons, and against pro-life demonstrators, environmental activists,
[00:39:26.639 --> 00:39:29.620]  And anyone else that doesn't totally submit to their tyranny.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:48.883]  The footage you're seeing is from the late 1980s and early 1990s, where the police openly pulled out nunchucks, started wrapping it around the arms of peaceful pro-life demonstrators and brutally breaking them, simply because they refused to get off the side of the sidewalk.
[00:39:49.183 --> 00:39:53.824]  The police thought it was their right to break people's arms because they didn't follow their orders.
[00:39:59.361 --> 00:40:01.863]  They used nunchucks on the rescuers.
[00:40:02.443 --> 00:40:08.747]  This is an illegal martial arts weapon and merely possessing one in California is a felony.
[00:40:09.287 --> 00:40:12.830]  To be attacked with one is assault with a deadly weapon.
[00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:19.354]  Never before in the history of America have nunchucks been used on non-violent protesters.
[00:40:20.014 --> 00:40:22.576]  This is the gruesome sight of what happened.
[00:40:28.877 --> 00:40:34.922]  The police, in unprovoked cruelty, wrapped the nunchucks around Michael Houseman's arm and broke it.
[00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:51.236]  When lawyers went to federal judge Tashima to request he order the police to cease using them, he denied the request, saying in so many words that pro-lifers could not prove they were in any danger.
[00:40:51.256 --> 00:40:55.440]  I can't tell you what it's like to be lying on the ground with police officers on
[00:40:56.341 --> 00:41:00.104]  On a top of you, using all sorts of torture holes to make you walk.
[00:41:00.144 --> 00:41:02.466]  You can't walk even if you wanted to walk.
[00:41:03.407 --> 00:41:04.988]  And their sole intent is to torture you.
[00:41:05.008 --> 00:41:08.492]  And then listening to the screams of the people.
[00:41:17.837 --> 00:41:22.059]  When you bring out riot sticks, it's usually because you expect to see some serious opposition.
[00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:25.621]  So you put on helmets, and you put on face masks, and you carry shields.
[00:41:26.041 --> 00:41:27.562]  These policemen were bareheaded.
[00:41:28.462 --> 00:41:32.805]  But here, it was calculated torture, and the policemen were enjoying the pain.
[00:41:33.705 --> 00:41:36.606]  They laughed at the people screaming, and all were screaming.
[00:41:36.987 --> 00:41:39.408]  All were grown men, mature men.
[00:41:40.488 --> 00:41:41.549]  You couldn't help but scream.
[00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.430]  What happened was, when the two
[00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:55.142]  Nightsticks squeezed on the wrists, they cut off the nerve ends and the flow of blood and your hands swelled up to almost twice the size and they turned black.
[00:41:56.423 --> 00:42:00.465]  It didn't matter whether you were a woman, a man, an old person.
[00:42:00.565 --> 00:42:03.166]  It didn't matter what your age, sex, or anything.
[00:42:03.186 --> 00:42:04.046]  That they were just there.
[00:42:04.066 --> 00:42:05.347]  They were going to brutalize everybody.
[00:42:05.407 --> 00:42:13.170]  And I think probably to the women more particularly, that they were very angry that they couldn't get a young woman like myself to walk.
[00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:15.812]  And I could tell that it was a pride issue.
[00:42:17.506 --> 00:42:23.937]  This is an important illustration because it shows us how long this tyranny has been going on in this country.
[00:42:24.518 --> 00:42:28.544]  And if they can get away with it with one group, they can get away with it against everybody.
[00:42:29.434 --> 00:42:41.705]  The fact of the matter is the establishment and its enforcers have been setting the precedent for a long time to torture women in plain view of the public, to use illegal nunchucks and break people's arms.
[00:42:42.346 --> 00:42:48.692]  And now in Iraq, they have these big live TV shows with all the people confessing after they've been openly tortured.
[00:42:48.712 --> 00:42:52.075]  For those that aren't watching, they have the nunchucks breaking the arms with pleasure.
[00:42:56.266 --> 00:43:04.375]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:43:04.535 --> 00:43:08.920]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:13.605]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:43:13.765 --> 00:43:15.187]  It's a documented fact.
[00:43:15.567 --> 00:43:22.654]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:43:22.814 --> 00:43:34.646]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:43:34.906 --> 00:43:38.590]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:41.552]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:43:42.292 --> 00:43:45.995]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[00:43:46.035 --> 00:43:49.317]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:43:49.337 --> 00:43:49.537]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:43:56.753 --> 00:44:02.058]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:09.546]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:16.313]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:16.713 --> 00:44:18.554]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:18.694 --> 00:44:21.116]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:21.196 --> 00:44:32.142]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:32.762 --> 00:44:34.063]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:34.443 --> 00:44:35.844]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:36.304 --> 00:44:42.528]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:50.986]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:51.466 --> 00:44:52.627]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:53.047 --> 00:44:54.248]  The people strike back!
[00:44:56.152 --> 00:45:00.993]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from HempUSA.org.
[00:45:01.193 --> 00:45:09.594]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[00:45:09.814 --> 00:45:14.495]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[00:45:14.735 --> 00:45:21.617]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[00:45:21.797 --> 00:45:24.257]  This water system will descale all piping.
[00:45:24.377 --> 00:45:24.677]  I don't know.
[00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.075]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[00:45:50.095 --> 00:45:50.375]  That's 908-691-2608.
[00:46:01.086 --> 00:46:17.573]  Yeah, for those that aren't watching this live from prisonplanet.tv, they've got nunchucks wrapped around people's arms, and they twist them until your arm breaks.
[00:46:18.593 --> 00:46:23.315]  And then, on video after video, I've got hours of this, we should put a few minutes in the film,
[00:46:25.339 --> 00:46:30.205]  After they break your arm, then they pull nightsticks out and like celebrate and like beat you with it.
[00:46:31.126 --> 00:46:33.529]  It's like, ah, you were bad, I broke your arm.
[00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:36.953]  I mean, it's just crazy, folks.
[00:46:37.734 --> 00:46:38.835]  So this is torture.
[00:46:38.875 --> 00:46:40.917]  And see, rather than put them on stretchers, take them to jail.
[00:46:41.761 --> 00:46:45.203]  No, no, they're going to punish you for making them pick you up.
[00:46:46.083 --> 00:46:47.063]  So, this has been going on.
[00:46:47.103 --> 00:46:51.785]  The police are taught to torture, that's what the tasers are all about, when they're used for compliance.
[00:46:51.825 --> 00:46:54.186]  They're used as self-defense, then that's another thing.
[00:46:55.347 --> 00:46:57.948]  But see, they can't just pull a gun out and shoot you to punish you, they get in trouble.
[00:46:57.968 --> 00:47:00.609]  But, oh, this thing that makes you have a heart attack, it's okay.
[00:47:01.189 --> 00:47:02.650]  Let's finish up with a clip, here it is.
[00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:09.193]  What's going on in this country, and if they can get away with it with one group, they can get away with it against everybody.
[00:47:10.083 --> 00:47:22.373]  The fact of the matter is the establishment and its enforcers have been setting the precedent for a long time to torture women in plain view of the public, to use illegal nunchucks and break people's arms.
[00:47:23.014 --> 00:47:30.100]  And now in Iraq they have these big live TV shows with all the people confessing after they've been openly tortured.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:42.850]  And in 2005, people they take into hospitals who refuse drug tests are restrained and then tasered repeatedly until they go ahead and urinate in a cup.
[00:47:43.591 --> 00:47:47.594]  And there are hundreds and hundreds of examples we don't even have time to cover here.
[00:47:48.194 --> 00:47:52.037]  The point is, this is all macabre and terrifying.
[00:47:52.378 --> 00:47:55.820]  And the New World Order is conditioning us to accept it.
[00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:57.482]  We must resist it.
[00:48:02.452 --> 00:48:05.375]  Alright, that's one of the extras.
[00:48:05.395 --> 00:48:06.817]  The other one's the real U.N.
[00:48:07.277 --> 00:48:08.599]  murdering and torturing children.
[00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:11.972]  I mean, somebody's got to document this stuff.
[00:48:11.992 --> 00:48:19.818]  And I notice YouTube always takes this video down or locks it down, but then they show piles of dead Jews or piles of dead Cambodians.
[00:48:20.539 --> 00:48:22.520]  That's far more graphic showing genitals.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.601]  This doesn't show genitals.
[00:48:23.621 --> 00:48:25.723]  It's just more of YouTube censorship.
[00:48:26.243 --> 00:48:30.146]  They don't want you to know what's happening currently right now here in the United States.
[00:48:30.186 --> 00:48:31.147]  Let's jam in another call.
[00:48:31.467 --> 00:48:32.288]  Who's up next here?
[00:48:32.348 --> 00:48:33.129]  Mark in Connecticut?
[00:48:33.569 --> 00:48:34.970]  Mark in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:35.591]  Go ahead, Mark.
[00:48:36.692 --> 00:48:37.072]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:38.624 --> 00:48:38.824]  Alex?
[00:48:39.765 --> 00:48:39.985]  Alex?
[00:48:41.246 --> 00:48:41.546]  Hello?
[00:48:41.787 --> 00:48:43.548]  Yeah, your phone may not be getting audio.
[00:48:43.568 --> 00:48:44.248]  You can't hear me?
[00:48:44.268 --> 00:48:46.150]  I can hear you right now, yeah.
[00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:48.211]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:48:49.072 --> 00:48:53.575]  Alright, um, since last week I heard your show about the chemtrails.
[00:48:54.256 --> 00:48:54.516]  Yes.
[00:48:55.277 --> 00:49:00.240]  I recorded and videotaped at least 40 planes since 11.30 this morning.
[00:49:01.481 --> 00:49:04.864]  Uh, this morning when I woke up, the sky was bright blue.
[00:49:05.104 --> 00:49:07.746]  Now, there are so many chemtrails in the sky.
[00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:09.979]  It looked like artificial clouds.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:16.061]  Well, what I need listeners to do for the chemtrail film, and I appreciate you doing that, is set up time-lapse.
[00:49:16.081 --> 00:49:24.724]  Don't move the camera, put new tapes in when it's a clear day like that, because that's what's going to prove it, is seeing the whoosh, and then how hours later it turns into clouds.
[00:49:24.744 --> 00:49:26.164]  You can see them expanding.
[00:49:26.644 --> 00:49:28.465]  And then the government admits it now they're doing it.
[00:49:28.505 --> 00:49:30.346]  They're just lying about how prolific it is.
[00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:32.626]  And I'm getting death threats about this, by the way.
[00:49:32.646 --> 00:49:34.867]  I got death threats on my children, we did report it.
[00:49:35.407 --> 00:49:37.808]  But there's so many, you can't report them all, but we did report this one.
[00:49:37.828 --> 00:49:41.189]  Because folks are very upset about us exposing their spring.
[00:49:41.229 --> 00:49:41.690]  Anything else?
[00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:48.633]  Actually, I have... What I recorded today was seven planes in a row.
[00:49:49.733 --> 00:49:50.113]  Spring.
[00:49:50.994 --> 00:49:55.375]  And right now, I'm looking at... Right in front of me, there's a trail.
[00:49:55.395 --> 00:49:57.376]  They've been doing it all morning today.
[00:49:58.397 --> 00:49:59.577]  I just saw my 40th plane.
[00:49:59.617 --> 00:50:01.378]  I'm actually looking at a plane right now.
[00:50:01.478 --> 00:50:03.839]  If anybody's in Connecticut, they can look up at the sky.
[00:50:04.525 --> 00:50:06.547]  And they can see all the trails right now.
[00:50:06.627 --> 00:50:06.847]  Good.
[00:50:06.867 --> 00:50:08.328]  I need everybody to videotape it.
[00:50:09.329 --> 00:50:10.590]  Get yourself talking on tape.
[00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:12.111]  I'll integrate it all into a film.
[00:50:12.512 --> 00:50:13.472]  The Chemtrail Hunters.
[00:50:13.492 --> 00:50:14.413]  That's not what we're going to call it.
[00:50:14.453 --> 00:50:16.915]  But, you know, that's what you're going to be called basically.
[00:50:16.935 --> 00:50:19.798]  And that's just very exciting that we're all doing this as a team effort.
[00:50:19.818 --> 00:50:21.259]  Anything else, Mark, in Connecticut?
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.261]  Is there any email or something that I can send the video to?
[00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:32.643]  It'd be better for film quality if you send me the tapes, or make copies of your tapes, or send them on chips or whatever.
[00:50:32.703 --> 00:50:34.444]  But yeah, robd at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:34.484 --> 00:50:35.384]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:38.385 --> 00:50:39.966]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:40.886 --> 00:50:43.207]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:46.155 --> 00:50:47.737]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:47.837 --> 00:50:52.463]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:52.583 --> 00:50:55.347]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:55.547 --> 00:50:58.431]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:50:58.591 --> 00:51:04.439]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:04.659 --> 00:51:07.602]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:07.902 --> 00:51:14.809]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:14.929 --> 00:51:18.012]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:18.172 --> 00:51:19.854]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:23.317 --> 00:51:29.401]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:29.581 --> 00:51:33.323]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:33.343 --> 00:51:34.684]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:34.704 --> 00:51:35.284]  Take action today.
[00:51:35.324 --> 00:51:37.305]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:48.903 --> 00:51:50.805]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:51.285 --> 00:51:54.207]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:12.841]  Raleigh James is joining us coming up in the next segment for the rest of the hour.
[00:52:12.881 --> 00:52:17.845]  Great talk show host syndicated on quite a few amanethyms across the country in XM and Sirius.
[00:52:19.622 --> 00:52:20.323]  She'll be on with us.
[00:52:20.363 --> 00:52:25.306]  We'll continue with some calls and just a host of news, including attacks on the First Amendment.
[00:52:25.326 --> 00:52:27.347]  Right now, we are taking phone calls.
[00:52:27.367 --> 00:52:36.854]  Bethany, in Maryland, you are on the air where mainstream news reported the Army was spying on the Tea Parties, because we're enemies of America.
[00:52:37.595 --> 00:52:45.740]  But, of course, the Army's been ordered to spy on the Army, too, by the criminals running the government, because they say people that love freedom and the Second Amendment are terrorists now in America.
[00:52:46.701 --> 00:52:47.942]  And the cat is out of the bag.
[00:52:48.142 --> 00:52:48.963]  Bethany, go ahead.
[00:52:50.276 --> 00:52:51.617]  Hi Alex, how are you today?
[00:52:52.158 --> 00:52:52.658]  Pretty good.
[00:52:52.698 --> 00:52:54.139]  Good to be here with you on this Friday.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:55.560]  Sweet.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.342]  Listen, you are just the best.
[00:52:57.422 --> 00:53:00.284]  I get such joy listening to you every day.
[00:53:00.324 --> 00:53:01.605]  I'm addicted to your program.
[00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:03.447]  I've just come upon you recently.
[00:53:03.507 --> 00:53:06.950]  My husband's gone crazy because all I want to do is listen to you night and day.
[00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:11.694]  The kids are like, oh no, not Alex Jones again, Mommy.
[00:53:11.794 --> 00:53:12.574]  But it's all good.
[00:53:12.594 --> 00:53:13.215]  It's all good.
[00:53:14.136 --> 00:53:19.340]  One of the things that I wanted to ask you is something that's very troubling.
[00:53:19.929 --> 00:53:22.617]  To me, the Codex Alimentarius
[00:53:24.017 --> 00:53:27.959]  I never hear any sort of discussion taking place about that.
[00:53:27.979 --> 00:53:40.245]  And it's implementation... Well we just talked about the bill to restrict and shut down organic farms, small family farms, animal ID, premises ID, SWAT teaming organic egg sellers on the side of the highway, SWAT teaming food pantries.
[00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:44.807]  Codex Alimentarius has admitted the UN has the meetings.
[00:53:45.167 --> 00:53:48.708]  You'll see a blurb in the news like, oh, vitamin B now can't be over the counter.
[00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:51.490]  The government wants to make it, you know, be a prescription.
[00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:57.332]  That's what's, or they go out and patent vitamins and say, it's like they patent seeds and say you can't have them.
[00:53:58.412 --> 00:54:00.773]  So yes, it's a big deal and it's happening.
[00:54:01.153 --> 00:54:02.353]  These are monopoly men.
[00:54:02.393 --> 00:54:06.534]  The globalists want monopolies and big government can enforce their monopolies.
[00:54:06.554 --> 00:54:09.595]  But I mean, you got a comment on it?
[00:54:09.635 --> 00:54:09.955]  Go ahead.
[00:54:10.475 --> 00:54:19.538]  Well, my comment is that I'd love to just, I guess, hear a little bit more about it because the readings that I've found is that it's supposed to be implemented globally.
[00:54:20.137 --> 00:54:22.179]  December 31st, 2009.
[00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:36.490]  And I guess what that entails is mandatory antibiotics and bovine growth hormones in all food animals that nutritional supplements will be deemed harmful, like you were saying.
[00:54:37.771 --> 00:54:42.976]  We won't have foods that are labeled anymore to tell us if they've been genetically modified.
[00:54:46.248 --> 00:54:55.396]  And I just don't know if they're going to be doing this like in increments or whether December 31st is going to be just an array of things that are just going to come out of a hat, so to speak.
[00:54:55.596 --> 00:54:55.856]  No, no.
[00:54:56.036 --> 00:54:57.498]  Everything they do is incremental.
[00:54:57.598 --> 00:55:02.582]  So you're hearing there will be police officers and they're creating new divisions of land management.
[00:55:02.882 --> 00:55:03.523]  They're here.
[00:55:03.723 --> 00:55:05.044]  Oh, you didn't get the form.
[00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:06.646]  We're going to arrest you.
[00:55:07.526 --> 00:55:10.469]  How did you get into the high school fair with your pig?
[00:55:10.509 --> 00:55:11.350]  This is happening.
[00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:14.211]  You know, like acting like the girl's a criminal, leading her off.
[00:55:14.612 --> 00:55:17.113]  So just lots of enforcement, lots of swarming.
[00:55:17.813 --> 00:55:29.419]  And so it's all part of a larger program as the drug companies, it's basically the military industrial complex, the drug companies, the media complex, and that's all owned by the big banks.
[00:55:29.679 --> 00:55:33.101]  They just create money out of nothing, and then we pay interest on the debt they create out of nothing.
[00:55:34.042 --> 00:55:37.904]  And so they're just incrementally doing it, but the incrementalism is sped up before it was like,
[00:55:38.604 --> 00:55:39.405]  I don't know.
[00:55:56.493 --> 00:55:56.733]  Uh-huh.
[00:55:57.194 --> 00:55:59.796]  And we purchase organic milk.
[00:56:00.016 --> 00:56:00.817]  We live in Maryland.
[00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:03.019]  We purchase the milk from Pennsylvania.
[00:56:03.039 --> 00:56:05.821]  There's an Amish farmer that comes down and delivers it.
[00:56:07.002 --> 00:56:08.844]  And an array of different products.
[00:56:08.884 --> 00:56:12.447]  People kind of mentioned that it was going... I was about to say we kind of got mentioned.
[00:56:13.087 --> 00:56:26.081]  After they were already, they had stakeouts at the farmers market in Austin for the Amish coming, and literally like a drug deal, the fresh milk that everybody used to be able to get was statistically a lot safer.
[00:56:27.263 --> 00:56:29.145]  So, let me guess, what happened?
[00:56:29.165 --> 00:56:30.166]  He can't bring the milk now?
[00:56:30.646 --> 00:56:36.168]  Well, interestingly enough, the Pennsylvania Department of Ag has followed him.
[00:56:36.228 --> 00:56:37.388]  I guess he's been harassed.
[00:56:37.408 --> 00:56:39.369]  They've been harassing him for the past year.
[00:56:39.389 --> 00:56:42.070]  Oh yeah, there's secret police everywhere, ma'am, on every issue.
[00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:45.651]  They're calling organic milk terrorism in some of these documents.
[00:56:45.691 --> 00:56:46.251]  I'm not joking.
[00:56:46.751 --> 00:56:50.192]  They call that the farm, you know, terrorism.
[00:56:50.912 --> 00:56:52.133]  So, listen, God bless you.
[00:56:52.153 --> 00:56:53.413]  We'll be right back with Raleigh James.
[00:56:53.773 --> 00:56:55.294]  Send it in to our show host, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:56.334 --> 00:57:01.437]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:57:01.717 --> 00:57:10.002]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:57:10.283 --> 00:57:13.585]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:57:13.845 --> 00:57:16.807]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:57:17.087 --> 00:57:19.208]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[00:57:19.588 --> 00:57:22.290]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products!
[00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:25.312]  Visit Tubingnatural.com and order today!
[00:57:25.712 --> 00:57:26.133]  We're good.
[00:57:46.315 --> 00:57:46.575]  Call 1-888-417-1375.
[00:57:46.595 --> 00:57:48.537]  That's 1-888-417-1375 to order or request your free catalog.
[00:57:48.637 --> 00:57:50.419]  In the New World Orders War Against Humanity.
[00:57:59.938 --> 00:58:02.040]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:09.587]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:10.147 --> 00:58:16.293]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:16.713 --> 00:58:18.554]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:18.694 --> 00:58:21.116]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:21.196 --> 00:58:32.142]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:32.762 --> 00:58:34.063]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:34.443 --> 00:58:35.824]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:36.304 --> 00:58:42.528]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:43.197 --> 00:58:50.980]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:52.621]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:53.041 --> 00:58:54.222]  The people strike back!
[00:58:56.656 --> 00:59:02.138]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:59:02.178 --> 00:59:02.698]  and the world.
[00:59:02.958 --> 00:59:06.419]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:59:06.819 --> 00:59:13.061]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:59:13.321 --> 00:59:15.102]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:59:15.362 --> 00:59:23.304]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:59:23.584 --> 00:59:28.006]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:59:28.266 --> 00:59:33.809]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:59:34.089 --> 00:59:36.110]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:38.511]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:59:38.851 --> 00:59:39.591]  We're good to go.
[00:59:57.253 --> 01:00:02.874]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.275 --> 01:00:07.455]  Well, syndicated talk show host Raleigh James is our guest.
[01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:12.837]  You can check out her website, Raleigh.net, R-O-L-L-Y-E.net.
[01:00:12.897 --> 01:00:18.478]  You can hear her no matter where you are on XM channel weeknights.
[01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:20.464]  10 p.m.
[01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:21.004]  to 1 a.m.
[01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:21.464]  Eastern.
[01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:25.829]  That's 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on Talk Channel 158.
[01:00:26.009 --> 01:00:29.893]  And I was just on there with her last week.
[01:00:29.913 --> 01:00:32.775]  I remember being in college.
[01:00:33.957 --> 01:00:43.585]  And I bring my little radio with me out to the apartment pool, me hanging out, talking to the college girls out there, suntanning, listening to Raleigh James.
[01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:45.187]  A great talk show host she was.
[01:00:45.587 --> 01:00:53.854]  Back when, you know, you're talking early 1990s, right when Clinton got in about Clinton being a murderer and mean Arkansas and cocaine dealing.
[01:00:53.874 --> 01:00:57.097]  And let me tell you, you weren't hearing this anywhere on talk radio in the country.
[01:00:57.937 --> 01:00:58.718]  It's an honor, Alex.
[01:00:58.798 --> 01:01:00.559]  Only for you would I wake up at the crack of noon.
[01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:29.591]  You are something else.
[01:01:29.951 --> 01:01:32.453]  You've been doing talk radio for quite a long time, haven't you?
[01:01:33.614 --> 01:01:37.478]  Yeah, over twenty years exclusively talking radio, over forty years.
[01:01:38.939 --> 01:01:42.202]  Wow, so you've been doing that since you were a schoolgirl, basically.
[01:01:42.742 --> 01:01:45.945]  I guess Limbaugh has been doing it since he was like eight years old.
[01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:50.469]  Raleigh, let's talk about, I mean, so much is going on.
[01:01:50.489 --> 01:01:53.552]  If I was guessing, what are you going to bring up first?
[01:01:53.592 --> 01:01:54.592]  Because I haven't talked to you today.
[01:01:55.273 --> 01:01:55.593]  Is it
[01:01:56.374 --> 01:02:00.156]  Is it the federal report saying the veterans and gun owners are the number one terror threat?
[01:02:00.576 --> 01:02:06.418]  Or is it the White House openly announcing they want to license all internet reporters and basically shut the web down?
[01:02:07.039 --> 01:02:09.540]  Or is it the IMF and World Bank saying we're in a depression?
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.921]  What's most important to you right now?
[01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:19.475]  Well, probably the thing that is always most important is the myth of the free press and why they want to continue that myth.
[01:02:19.675 --> 01:02:22.878]  And the folks who are thinking in terms of Fairness Doctrine, forget it.
[01:02:23.298 --> 01:02:24.979]  They are after the internet.
[01:02:25.099 --> 01:02:29.323]  And the Rosa Brooks article that you have on InfoWars.com is one tactic.
[01:02:29.363 --> 01:02:30.704]  They'll do anything they can.
[01:02:31.272 --> 01:02:33.634]  And I think that people are being led astray.
[01:02:33.954 --> 01:02:47.206]  For instance, I found the coverage of the Tea Party's interesting, and regardless of what people think in terms of whether that worked, didn't work, who was there, whether it was well-intentioned, the issue is immediately it was brought up, oh, this is Fox News.
[01:02:47.876 --> 01:02:58.727]  And the fascinating part to me on that is that to a good degree they believe every bit of it and they want to make sure that the myth of the free press continues, that we don't have that coverage.
[01:02:59.007 --> 01:03:03.011]  They are much more afraid of you long term than they'll ever be afraid of Fox News.
[01:03:04.633 --> 01:03:07.495]  Well, that's why Fox News is trying to act like us now.
[01:03:07.555 --> 01:03:19.303]  I mean, you've been talking about this a lot longer than I have, and accurately, and suddenly, they say, oh, there's a New World Order, there's a global currency, but don't worry, Rick Perry and the Republicans will save us when they're bought and paid for by the same people.
[01:03:19.343 --> 01:03:32.672]  So, now that the Republicans are out of power, they can pose as the opposition, but that does show that now, though, that they know the opposition to the New World Order is there, so now a major party is trying to
[01:03:33.152 --> 01:03:34.773]  Camouflage themselves like us.
[01:03:34.933 --> 01:03:41.676]  I mean, this is a threat and a danger, but isn't it also very positive that they're now having to legitimize us?
[01:03:43.277 --> 01:03:56.723]  That is positive, but until we see any of the talking heads awaken and say they're Republicans and Demopublicans and this is going on above it, and until they say, yeah, the Federal Reserve, we understand, but let's look at the BIS, the Bank of International Settlements,
[01:03:57.125 --> 01:04:00.596]  Until they're on that level, then really they're still a tool.
[01:04:01.017 --> 01:04:02.822]  Oh, by the way, it's back there in my office.
[01:04:03.834 --> 01:04:20.480]  You're like, Alex, of course you know about the International Bank of Settlements document, where they admit in 2006 they were engineering this, and I said no, and then you emailed it to me, and now it's off their website, and that's going to be in the new film, but that shows none of us know at all, or even half of it, so maybe we should cover that later.
[01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:25.702]  But yeah, these guys are right out in the open about what they're doing.
[01:04:26.182 --> 01:04:27.523]  Let's get into the Internet first, though.
[01:04:28.343 --> 01:04:35.648]  You had a caller on your show when I was on there a few days ago, and he said, I just don't believe you, Alex, that they could shut the web down and they're taking it over.
[01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:44.135]  And I said, I'm reading the bill, sir, where they say they're going to make all the private companies have NSA hubs in them to be able to shut the web off.
[01:04:44.175 --> 01:04:44.915]  That's in the bill.
[01:04:45.255 --> 01:04:47.077]  Senator Jay Rockefeller says he wants it.
[01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:50.198]  And the guy just said, I can't believe you, they can't shut it down.
[01:04:50.238 --> 01:04:53.618]  And you explained to him they could, and they are moving towards that.
[01:04:54.199 --> 01:04:55.899]  Why do you think people, A, are in such denial?
[01:04:55.939 --> 01:05:02.421]  And B, do you want to explain to them, because I thought you did it really well, better than I would, how they can control the web and some of the different tactics they're using?
[01:05:03.881 --> 01:05:08.282]  Well, I think people are in denial because it's a very comfortable place to be.
[01:05:08.502 --> 01:05:12.363]  If you wake up, if you start to listen to your show, Alex, and you listen just for a week,
[01:05:12.788 --> 01:05:19.751]  Unless you're fully brain-dead, it has agitated you to the point to realize that your world is not as you think it, and maybe you'll have to get involved.
[01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:20.892]  And people don't want to get involved.
[01:05:21.312 --> 01:05:23.433]  The first thing they want to do is shoot the messenger.
[01:05:23.513 --> 01:05:26.834]  Oh, if it's coming from Alex or coming from Raleigh, then I don't have to believe it.
[01:05:27.235 --> 01:05:30.456]  So that's a human nature thing in terms of why they're there.
[01:05:30.776 --> 01:05:39.220]  But the most dangerous thing about the plan, and it is a plan, and it will happen, to control, if not shut down, control the Internet, which is very easy to do.
[01:05:40.117 --> 01:05:47.738]  Uh, is the way it's been couched as free market decisions when Comcast was first wanting to differentiate traffic.
[01:05:48.208 --> 01:05:50.469]  So that they could, in fact, manage bandwidth.
[01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.631]  It's one thing to say we're going to limit the bandwidth overall.
[01:05:52.651 --> 01:05:56.533]  It's another thing to say a packet's not a packet, and we're going to decide what gets through more quickly.
[01:05:56.873 --> 01:05:59.255]  And this is the whole issue of net neutrality or not.
[01:05:59.895 --> 01:06:07.780]  When that came up, the Federal Trade Commission couched it in very Republican terms when they said, well, this will be a free market decision.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.602]  We're not going to get involved in the business practices.
[01:06:11.187 --> 01:06:16.349]  And the term free market, that's very comfortable to many people, libertarians included.
[01:06:16.369 --> 01:06:18.230]  This is not a free market decision.
[01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:19.310]  This is about control.
[01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:33.276]  And in terms of how you control it, well, the internet is not this amorphous thing with one little connection to you and one little connection to me, the way some people believe that it's a situation where it's more of this amorphous grid.
[01:06:33.969 --> 01:06:36.730]  All of it travels through bigger pipes.
[01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:43.394]  And in fact, when we were talking about the WorldCom bankruptcy and everybody talked about dark fiber, this is at the heart of it.
[01:06:43.434 --> 01:06:44.374]  They weren't using it then.
[01:06:44.814 --> 01:06:50.457]  But the reality is you don't get from point A to point B on some little spider web network.
[01:06:50.497 --> 01:06:52.838]  You're going over large pipes at some point.
[01:06:53.191 --> 01:06:56.554]  So all you have to do is moderate that pipe.
[01:06:56.634 --> 01:06:58.516]  You don't even have to shut it down, just moderate it.
[01:06:58.576 --> 01:07:03.981]  And anyone who doubts that, look what's going on in Australia right now, or what's always been going on in China.
[01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:14.190]  Even for Google, who in many ways is the enemy, for them to get into China, they have to agree, well we're going to limit what you can see, and it can be done with a keystroke.
[01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:21.811]  And there's other stuff, you know, Google hid the most viewed videos and for a while took it off even their front page.
[01:07:22.312 --> 01:07:27.353]  Now they've announced, oh, we're going to be like Hulu, which is their right to do, but now they're the big dominant system.
[01:07:27.573 --> 01:07:33.035]  They built it on, we're free, we're open, we're never going to censor you as long as it's your own content.
[01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:51.749]  And so the people built YouTube and now they've gone back and they say, oh, we're going to make all the front pages now, CBS and Sony content, and we're going to have one little link to pages that we want to show you of the general public who have pages.
[01:07:51.969 --> 01:07:58.314]  And so they decide who to promote and literally wall off and censor and knock down the view counters.
[01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:00.976]  I mean, we've had videos of millions of views and they'll just take our
[01:08:01.616 --> 01:08:06.618]  Little ribbon away, so we go off the main page, and they now admit they're doing that.
[01:08:06.918 --> 01:08:09.478]  YouTube is taking the U out of tube now.
[01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:11.479]  Oh, of course.
[01:08:11.599 --> 01:08:28.404]  And you know, you mentioned Google, and I do call them the Antichrist in many ways, but going back to your Rosa Brooks article on how to, in fact, foster newspaper readership, if you want to put it in the best terms, Google, you've heard about their plan to promote localism.
[01:08:28.752 --> 01:08:30.053]  Well, remember, it's Yahoo and Google
[01:08:45.323 --> 01:09:01.053]  uh... who have been contracted by the chinese government to help them run the filters google runs the filters for china rupert murdoch and news core runs the filters to be there and then that still was enough for the chinese government they shut some of it down but you know it's it's it's yahoo turning over
[01:09:01.974 --> 01:09:05.598]  People in China sending emails to activist groups in the U.S.
[01:09:05.718 --> 01:09:10.123]  and then they're getting prison sentences or being executed and Yahoo's proud of that.
[01:09:10.223 --> 01:09:19.953]  So to say they can't flip the same systems they've built on here is a fraud when they're even announcing for our own good they're going to be doing it.
[01:09:21.254 --> 01:09:24.638]  Absolutely and the Yahoo thing was just horrendous and of course
[01:09:25.003 --> 01:09:43.023]  Major media gave that no play, but it's very simple to do, and actually it's the business model that they have, long before the censorship issue, in order for, like you were saying with your films, and it's so right, in order for them to succeed, they're going to weight the content the way they want to.
[01:09:43.519 --> 01:09:45.440]  And it can be done very subtly.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.741]  It doesn't have to be done in such an effort where people will be saying, oh, the bootstraps got us.
[01:09:50.061 --> 01:09:56.124]  It can be done much more subtly than that, and it is as manipulative as anything you're seeing out of major media.
[01:09:56.464 --> 01:10:07.187]  The real key and the golden part of the Internet is the net neutrality part, that if you put up InfoWars and I go there, I get there on the same route as if I go to Amazon or anyone else.
[01:10:07.267 --> 01:10:11.609]  And other than hub control, which I'll leave out, the issue is that we're all equal.
[01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:22.098]  And that is the thing that absolutely the government wants to tear down, and they will do it as a free market decision, and of course the Googles and the Yahoos will be the leaders behind it because it benefits them.
[01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:31.114]  Well, we have to fight this now, because look how many crazy things are happening right now, listeners, who we thought couldn't happen before, but it's happening.
[01:10:31.714 --> 01:10:33.595]  The elite is collapsing.
[01:10:33.635 --> 01:10:35.176]  The mainline newspapers are collapsing.
[01:10:35.196 --> 01:10:36.277]  Somebody wants to read their crap.
[01:10:37.498 --> 01:10:39.299]  The TV cable ratings are down.
[01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:41.160]  The system is in crisis.
[01:10:41.761 --> 01:10:43.202]  The lies are coming out.
[01:10:43.462 --> 01:10:45.343]  The alternative media is exploding.
[01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:52.368]  And so the newspaper owners have conventions and admit, and that's what the Obama administration is saying, let us start restricting
[01:10:53.368 --> 01:10:57.090]  Free speech media, get behind us doing this or you're not going to have a job.
[01:10:57.110 --> 01:11:00.691]  So you're going to have government and the media teaming up together against the new media.
[01:11:00.971 --> 01:11:04.773]  The establishment can't have us on air unseating them.
[01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:06.714]  They're not going to go without a fight.
[01:11:06.834 --> 01:11:10.295]  Now that said, I want you to talk about this and get your take on it.
[01:11:11.136 --> 01:11:15.637]  The people have had this taste though, for alternative, for real variety.
[01:11:17.745 --> 01:11:23.591]  Do you think they're going to be able to be successful in the long run, keeping people from misinformation, now that they've had a taste of it?
[01:11:25.066 --> 01:11:26.487]  Depends how subtle they are at it.
[01:11:26.547 --> 01:11:30.369]  Everything they do is incrementalism, like they're taking it out of the Fabian's playbook.
[01:11:30.449 --> 01:11:36.212]  But their greatest fear is that the myth of the free press will become, in fact, unmasked.
[01:11:36.353 --> 01:11:41.215]  That we will know that it's no longer if it's in the New York Times, that it's legit.
[01:11:41.415 --> 01:11:48.580]  And they are going to do anything they can to keep the average person unaware of exactly what we're talking about.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:49.880]  Exactly.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.663]  They admit the Defense Department finances most of the TV and media, and it's all fake news.
[01:11:53.683 --> 01:11:54.504]  So, there you go.
[01:11:54.524 --> 01:11:55.324]  Discredited there.
[01:11:56.465 --> 01:11:57.346]  Spring is here.
[01:11:57.586 --> 01:11:58.366]  Growing season.
[01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:00.528]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:12:00.728 --> 01:12:02.149]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:12:02.449 --> 01:12:03.110]  Think about it.
[01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:07.273]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:12:07.513 --> 01:12:10.996]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:12:11.256 --> 01:12:12.877]  The country is running out of food.
[01:12:13.157 --> 01:12:15.679]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.

[01:12:55.093 --> 01:13:01.657]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:02.453 --> 01:13:07.796]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:08.316 --> 01:13:14.519]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:14.739 --> 01:13:16.640]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.181]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:30.147]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:32.435 --> 01:13:33.696]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:34.096 --> 01:13:35.497]  It's about a one world government.
[01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:42.341]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:15:46.961 --> 01:15:47.001]  866-598-7396.
[01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:04.632]  You can go to our website, R-O-L-L-Y-E dot net, Raleigh dot net.
[01:16:04.672 --> 01:16:06.953]  Raleigh James is our guest syndicate radio talk show host.
[01:16:07.474 --> 01:16:12.196]  Anybody can hear her who's got XM on channel 158 for everybody out there.
[01:16:12.216 --> 01:16:14.577]  She's on 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:16:16.018 --> 01:16:20.620]  Okay, Raleigh, let's go right back to this issue of First Amendment for anything else you want to add on that front.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.942]  Then I want to get into, I want to get your take on this.
[01:16:25.177 --> 01:16:31.438]  They're phrasing it that Obama is this wonderful guy who released the torture memos.
[01:16:31.478 --> 01:16:39.280]  But what he's done is come out and confirm what was already public and say they were following orders so they're protected.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:48.721]  Reversing the Nuremberg Principle of just following orders doesn't cover it when you're, say, raping people in front of their husbands to get answers, as they admit they did.
[01:16:49.541 --> 01:16:53.022]  So finish up any First Amendment comments and then I want to get your take on that.
[01:16:54.902 --> 01:17:04.925]  I think Obama, in addition to everything we're talking about on a personal level, has been schooled his entire lifetime to dislike and distrust the press unless he could manipulate it.
[01:17:04.985 --> 01:17:08.786]  And you talked very often about what he was doing on the campaign to reporters.
[01:17:09.186 --> 01:17:16.288]  So what they've got here is, in addition to all their plans, they have someone who's emotionally poised to implement whatever it takes.
[01:17:18.547 --> 01:17:19.868]  Yeah, he really is slippery.
[01:17:19.908 --> 01:17:26.813]  I think he's more slippery than Bill Clinton because it always sounds great, but when you look right below the surface it's always 170 or 180.
[01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:31.397]  Sometimes it's a little true, but usually it's about 180 degrees a lie.
[01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:33.018]  You know, it's just totally away from the truth.
[01:17:34.159 --> 01:17:34.319]  Yes.
[01:17:35.836 --> 01:17:38.337]  And now I've got Democrats writing editorials attacking me.
[01:17:38.377 --> 01:17:39.337]  I've got one here today.
[01:17:39.357 --> 01:17:42.078]  And she says, yeah, he's lied about a bunch of stuff.
[01:17:42.438 --> 01:17:44.319]  He lied about things a little too quickly.
[01:17:44.339 --> 01:17:46.260]  It would have been alright if he lied later.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.921]  But, you know, he did go back on his promises a little too quick.
[01:17:49.301 --> 01:17:52.382]  But still, Alex, you're the liar, but never says what I'm lying about.
[01:17:53.905 --> 01:17:57.088]  Well they have to reposition you, they have to shoot the messenger.
[01:17:57.429 --> 01:18:03.195]  Whenever you've got a situation where the message is irrefutable, you've got to come at it at another angle and you know that.
[01:18:03.395 --> 01:18:09.801]  So demonizing you is the easiest way for them to remain in control.
[01:18:09.881 --> 01:18:12.664]  To make it seem that you are truly the lunatic fringe.
[01:18:12.744 --> 01:18:15.007]  But it's ridiculous, like you said though.
[01:18:15.828 --> 01:18:20.852]  This lady that wrote this latest hit piece, it's from Man Eater, it doesn't say anything I'm wrong about.
[01:18:20.892 --> 01:18:23.935]  It just says, he's a crazy, he's a nut, flying saucers.
[01:18:24.435 --> 01:18:25.837]  I don't talk about flying saucers.
[01:18:27.078 --> 01:18:28.539]  Right, but they have to shoot the messenger.
[01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:32.583]  They'll claim he came off of the flying saucers if they have to.
[01:18:33.464 --> 01:18:34.465]  That's a good one.
[01:18:35.285 --> 01:18:39.709]  It's tremendously effective, because this is what I was saying before about the myth of the free press.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.422]  The bulk of the population still buys it.
[01:18:42.962 --> 01:18:48.488]  For instance, the people who will say, if it's in the National Enquirer, I don't believe it, but if it's in the New York Times, I do.
[01:18:48.788 --> 01:18:53.012]  Well, with that litmus test, I'll take the Enquirer over the Times every day of the week.
[01:18:53.413 --> 01:19:00.520]  But people want to remain in that comfortable place where, oh, but it's not in the New York Times.
[01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:03.452]  So, they still have what they want.
[01:19:03.692 --> 01:19:07.435]  They won't for long, and they know this, and they're seeing the cracks in it.
[01:19:07.896 --> 01:19:18.044]  And, yeah, regardless of what they say about you for the record, they know how many people have watched your movies collectively, and they know that's in the tens of millions of people.
[01:19:18.444 --> 01:19:23.969]  So, at this point, anything they can do to demonize you, they will, because it's the only tool they've got.
[01:19:25.421 --> 01:19:27.502]  Well, I just hope it's not a prelude to something else.
[01:19:27.802 --> 01:19:31.063]  You've had a lot thrown at you over the years, being syndicated across the land.
[01:19:32.163 --> 01:19:45.527]  What is it like, though, Riley, to go from, well, people always listen to you because you always have the facts and we're very convincing, but still, you know, some people disagreed, to where now, more and more, everything we've said is almost passe now.
[01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:48.928]  It's just all out in the open, but they just put a different spin on it.
[01:19:49.088 --> 01:19:50.129]  The establishment does it.
[01:19:50.169 --> 01:19:50.809]  It's a good thing.
[01:19:52.363 --> 01:19:53.343]  Well, that's the key.
[01:19:53.563 --> 01:19:59.366]  After they're done demonizing you, the next thing is to say, well, what he's saying is all folly.
[01:19:59.426 --> 01:20:05.848]  Of course, this is what he thought it was, you know, but he's getting 2 and 2 to equal 22, and it's always been 4.
[01:20:06.678 --> 01:20:10.222]  And that's the method, and we're seeing that every day.
[01:20:10.522 --> 01:20:18.591]  Janet Napolitano backtracking on the DHS saying, oh well no, we weren't actually trying to demean the military.
[01:20:19.011 --> 01:20:21.153]  In other words, reposition it.
[01:20:21.274 --> 01:20:25.358]  If they can't reposition you, the next thing they have to do is reposition the message.
[01:20:27.642 --> 01:20:33.387]  But that's what a real tyranny does, is it starts spying on its own military and police, and we know they've been doing that all along.
[01:20:35.108 --> 01:20:37.410]  I don't see things going too well for the new world order, though.
[01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:40.973]  I mean, I think it's going to be a rough ride, but I think they're in trouble.
[01:20:41.233 --> 01:20:41.674]  What do you think?
[01:20:43.243 --> 01:20:46.406]  Well, the more people awaken, the more they are, and you see that worldwide.
[01:20:46.546 --> 01:21:04.342]  The thing that they're very much afraid of is that as people are personally hurting, human nature takes over, and just like the riots across the world where they said, hell no, you're not going to import foreigners to work here, we need these jobs, people do turn to self-protection, and that's a great fear.
[01:21:04.847 --> 01:21:07.172]  So, they know what they're up against.
[01:21:07.312 --> 01:21:11.159]  But, you know, I mentioned the Fabians earlier and you've talked about them a lot, too.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:12.562]  The incrementalism.
[01:21:12.602 --> 01:21:14.245]  Do everything in small increments.
[01:21:14.265 --> 01:21:15.167]  Well, what's happened now?
[01:21:16.165 --> 01:21:18.086]  We're on an exponential multiplier.
[01:21:18.126 --> 01:21:22.689]  We're now at the point where, in fact, it can be implemented.
[01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:24.811]  And so, a lot of people are going for it.
[01:21:24.851 --> 01:21:25.631]  Do it all now!
[01:21:25.651 --> 01:21:30.555]  And you saw that with a lot of the early legislation out of Obama.
[01:21:30.595 --> 01:21:31.495]  Get it all in now!
[01:21:31.835 --> 01:21:33.256]  Alright, long segment coming up.
[01:21:33.276 --> 01:21:34.277]  We'll all stick a few calls.
[01:21:34.297 --> 01:21:34.918]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:21:35.438 --> 01:21:37.559]  He's Raleigh James.
[01:21:37.879 --> 01:21:38.600]  Raleigh.net.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.641]  R-O-L-L-Y-E.net.
[01:21:41.002 --> 01:21:41.742]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:21:42.002 --> 01:21:43.143]  Infowars.com.
[01:21:43.223 --> 01:21:43.683]  Stay with us.
[01:21:43.703 --> 01:21:44.424]  More straight ahead.
[01:21:46.403 --> 01:21:49.384]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:50.304 --> 01:21:53.065]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:56.346 --> 01:22:00.187]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[01:22:00.327 --> 01:22:04.548]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[01:22:05.188 --> 01:22:07.929]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:12.350]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:13.990]  We're good to go.
[01:22:36.636 --> 01:22:41.959]  Call 1-800-605-4229 right now and get 30 days of life lock for free.
[01:22:42.079 --> 01:22:44.541]  Protect yourself and your family from identity theft.
[01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:46.762]  And when you call right now get 30 days free.
[01:22:46.862 --> 01:22:47.562]  Call now 1-800-605-4229.
[01:22:47.602 --> 01:22:47.882]  That's 1-800-605-4229.
[01:22:47.922 --> 01:22:48.123]  Again 1-800-605-4229.
[01:22:56.767 --> 01:23:02.069]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:02.569 --> 01:23:09.571]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:16.293]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:16.733 --> 01:23:18.574]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:18.695 --> 01:23:21.116]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:32.144]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:32.784 --> 01:23:34.065]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:34.465 --> 01:23:35.846]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:36.307 --> 01:23:42.531]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:23:43.217 --> 01:23:51.002]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:51.483 --> 01:23:52.643]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:53.064 --> 01:23:54.325]  The people strike back.
[01:23:57.026 --> 01:23:57.887]  You are a rebel.
[01:23:58.187 --> 01:23:58.587]  Admit it.
[01:23:58.928 --> 01:24:01.709]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[01:24:01.890 --> 01:24:03.971]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[01:24:04.291 --> 01:24:07.994]  Once in a while you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[01:24:08.234 --> 01:24:11.476]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot and you can count your real friends.
[01:24:13.444 --> 01:24:13.844]  I think?
[01:24:47.671 --> 01:24:49.612]  Tell me folks aboard, there ain't no way to fly.
[01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:18.199]  We're good.
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.521]  Man, isn't life amazing?
[01:25:34.601 --> 01:25:42.484]  We're on this planet spinning through the dark void of space.
[01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:46.705]  I'm sitting here talking to Raleigh James.
[01:25:46.785 --> 01:25:49.146]  I'm in Austin, Texas.
[01:25:59.790 --> 01:26:01.071]  People listening all over the world.
[01:26:01.091 --> 01:26:03.231]  The establishment doesn't like this.
[01:26:03.251 --> 01:26:06.252]  They call the internet the worldwide wiretap.
[01:26:07.013 --> 01:26:15.896]  They want to build the grid, get us used to using it, get us addicted, just like YouTube is a microcosm, then take the freedom away, kick us off, and then that's the whole system.
[01:26:16.576 --> 01:26:17.676]  And that's basically what's happening.
[01:26:18.977 --> 01:26:21.098]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:26:21.118 --> 01:26:24.999]  Raleigh, there's so much going on, I shouldn't just be throwing out the questions here.
[01:26:26.279 --> 01:26:28.400]  What are some other subjects you think are important to get into?
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.661]  And that said, before we get into that,
[01:26:32.552 --> 01:26:46.040]  I think they really miscalculated with these reports coming out saying the troops are the number one threat, gun owners are threats, people buying ammo are basically terrorists, pro-lifers are basically terrorists, people against open borders are basically terrorists.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.942]  I mean, the secret police are really getting exposed right now.
[01:26:51.835 --> 01:26:55.439]  They are, but it's a great indoctrination tool because they'll backpedal from this.
[01:26:55.479 --> 01:26:57.542]  In other words, put the worst possible spin on it.
[01:26:57.602 --> 01:26:58.963]  Oh, no, no, but that's not what we mean.
[01:26:59.003 --> 01:27:12.679]  Now, here's why we're saying this, and the other day when I heard the comment about, well, we have to look at the military because look at Timothy McVeigh, and I thought to myself, well, let's take that logic now and let's just
[01:27:12.919 --> 01:27:21.903]  Consistently expand it and say, well, if we're looking at the military because of Timothy McVeigh, then we've got to look at the federal central government because of Adolf Hitler.
[01:27:21.923 --> 01:27:29.987]  So, you know, the reality, though, is that they will give you, you know, the worst shock.
[01:27:30.087 --> 01:27:33.168]  And then when they peddle back, people say, oh, see, it's not that bad.
[01:27:33.228 --> 01:27:34.429]  That's really what's happening.
[01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:36.649]  So I'm not sure they miscalculated.
[01:27:36.730 --> 01:27:37.310]  It's incrementalism.
[01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:39.831]  You think they may have been leaking some of these on purpose?
[01:27:40.919 --> 01:27:51.348]  Well, I think it's very possible, and you know, when we talk about it, you asked what's on my mind, and everybody talks about globalism, and they think about it as if it's an international thing.
[01:27:51.688 --> 01:27:53.470]  It's not, it's a supranational thing.
[01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:59.796]  There is a control level in globalism that makes the control level in our country look tame.
[01:28:00.076 --> 01:28:06.882]  But not only that, some of the documents I had sent you about the Bank of International Settlement, there's a lot more in this basal two.
[01:28:07.322 --> 01:28:21.655]  And what's fascinating is when everybody jumped on Obama's statement, everybody in terms of like you and I and people who were awake, when it looked like, and it is, that he will go after compensation practices.
[01:28:22.076 --> 01:28:26.560]  Everybody thought, oh my god, well that's right out of Basil II.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.681]  There's three pillars.
[01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:34.997]  And the first one, of course, was the capital requirements, which is the way that they've decimated banking worldwide.
[01:28:35.258 --> 01:28:38.901]  But the next one, pillar two, is supervisory oversight.
[01:28:39.282 --> 01:28:51.174]  And right out of their documents, they talk about, in fact, including compensation practices as things that they need for worldwide, firm-wide governance and management.
[01:28:51.274 --> 01:28:52.095]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:52.275 --> 01:29:13.596]  And for folks that are hearing these technical terms and not getting it, I'm not saying dumb it down, because most of our audience knows more than we do, but for those that don't understand, they're openly announcing a new global bank of the world to fix the banking system when they created the fiat mess to begin with, and they're going to have global taxes, global regulations, global control, set the currency, set the interest rates, and they're openly announcing this.
[01:29:13.616 --> 01:29:14.197]  Please continue.
[01:29:15.407 --> 01:29:16.067]  Yeah, they are.
[01:29:16.327 --> 01:29:23.770]  And of course, for people who don't know what the Bank of International Settlements is, it's the Federal Reserve and all the central banks' bank.
[01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:26.231]  This is the place where they go.
[01:29:26.451 --> 01:29:30.252]  And the reason we call it the Basel Accords is it's all coming out of Basel, Switzerland.
[01:29:30.612 --> 01:29:32.873]  And Basel II was implemented in steps.
[01:29:32.973 --> 01:29:35.033]  It actually goes back to 1999.
[01:29:35.073 --> 01:29:37.754]  It was accepted by our Federal Reserve and everybody else in 2005, and it
[01:29:40.205 --> 01:29:41.106]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:29:41.166 --> 01:29:43.248]  This isn't all the countries working together.
[01:29:43.268 --> 01:29:45.890]  This is a global corporate web over the earth telling all the countries
[01:30:02.586 --> 01:30:05.487]  It's not the countries together deciding what's going to be done.
[01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:07.927]  It's this web telling all of us what to do.
[01:30:07.987 --> 01:30:16.509]  So none of the direction or will of the people is being manifest in that for all the liberals that say, oh, it's the next phase, like Star Trek, One Big World.
[01:30:17.009 --> 01:30:21.970]  I don't have that document in front of me because it's back there in my office and from the International Bank of Settlements.
[01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.610]  Do you have that?
[01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:23.750]  I know it's up at Raleigh.net.
[01:30:24.130 --> 01:30:27.651]  For those that don't know, I mean, they say right there in their own technical language
[01:30:28.231 --> 01:30:33.073]  That they're going to be imploding things 2008-2009 to bring in the next phase.
[01:30:33.153 --> 01:30:36.894]  There is the proof in yet another document where they're engineering this.
[01:30:38.394 --> 01:30:56.740]  Yeah, I'm looking for that because I've got probably a hundred pages of this, but what you were really talking about is the fact that what Basel II did, and they have it right in their documents, is that they allowed banks to dictate their own capital requirements
[01:30:57.219 --> 01:31:05.067]  And they set this up, and what they pretty much had said was that everything would hit the fan by 2009 when this was implemented.
[01:31:06.108 --> 01:31:08.451]  But that's just the tip of the iceberg, Alex.
[01:31:08.491 --> 01:31:10.873]  I need to send you more documents, to say the least.
[01:31:11.274 --> 01:31:18.882]  Because, again, what we're looking at here is, at first, the capital requirements, which is what we talked about on the air the other night.
[01:31:19.232 --> 01:31:31.218]  But Pillar 2 is the supervisory oversight, and this is where we're going to see them call the shot for how our private CEOs are compensated.
[01:31:31.639 --> 01:31:37.942]  And then when you get to Pillar 3, if Pillar 2 is the law enforcer, Pillar 3 will be the handcuffs.
[01:31:37.982 --> 01:31:39.603]  That's when they've got the total control.
[01:31:40.782 --> 01:31:50.608]  And then they've already, in 2000, had a global summit in Australia with the UN where most of the nations on the planet, all the big western ones, signed on for global standardization for World ID.
[01:31:51.029 --> 01:31:57.893]  And that's really what was adopted years later in the real ID in the US and England and Australia and everywhere else.
[01:31:58.233 --> 01:32:02.216]  We already have a global standardized system being forced in.
[01:32:02.556 --> 01:32:07.940]  So right when we hear there's really a national ID card, no, it's really a world ID grid.
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:15.886]  And the way they announce it is, oh, you get thumbprinted when you go to England or Germany now, and foreigners get thumbprinted here, too, with a digital biometric.
[01:32:15.946 --> 01:32:16.807]  It's all the same.
[01:32:18.128 --> 01:32:18.608]  Oh, sure it is.
[01:32:18.868 --> 01:32:26.434]  And, you know, people who think that, well, I'm aware of that, I'm aware of the IMF, well, the IMF is secondary to Basel, to say the least.
[01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:31.698]  And so, just like when you talk about the Council of Foreign Relations, 3,000 members, yeah, well, 2,990 don't know exactly what's going on.
[01:32:34.767 --> 01:32:43.114]  And it's the same thing here, but the interesting thing, and you probably heard this on the news too, is that now Bernanke says they're going to release our stress tests on our bank.
[01:32:43.634 --> 01:32:49.659]  And of course, stress tests come right out of the IMF, which of course is dictated by the BIS, the Bank of America.
[01:32:49.679 --> 01:32:53.643]  Yeah, that means your country is under receivership when this is happening.
[01:32:53.683 --> 01:33:01.749]  They set it up, they give you the money, they set up the Ponzi scheme, and then they come in and say, what you must do with your industries, your roads, you must hand this to that corporation, to that.
[01:33:02.050 --> 01:33:03.511]  This is literally the looting now.
[01:33:04.884 --> 01:33:05.425]  Right, right.
[01:33:05.485 --> 01:33:16.716]  And when we talk about, as you were mentioning, carbon taxes or energy taxes, consumption taxes, these are right out of IMF documents, and of course that comes, you go back further and you say, oh, it comes right out of Basel.
[01:33:17.077 --> 01:33:27.608]  So it's a couple-step situation, but the thing that you were alluding to earlier, this IMF document, because every couple years they have these consultations
[01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:36.813]  Well, in 2006, the Article 4 Consultation on page 13, and this again is 2006... Yes, say that slowly, because I'm going to have my guys do a story on this.
[01:33:36.853 --> 01:33:37.753]  I mean, there's so many of these.
[01:33:37.813 --> 01:33:53.039]  I've seen many others similar, but here's just another one where you see all the premeditation, and right at this time we're at Bilderberg, where they've made the decision, we get the intel from the actual heads of all the major pyramid structures, which again are compartmentalized, but they all nexus in to meet
[01:33:53.439 --> 01:33:55.581]  Okay, it's IMF United States 2006 Article 4 Consultation Staff Report, page 13.
[01:34:13.698 --> 01:34:17.121]  And again, the IMF and this report, they're not creating this.
[01:34:17.202 --> 01:34:20.765]  They're reporting on what is in the Basel II documents.
[01:34:20.825 --> 01:34:23.948]  And you can read the entire Basel II Accord.
[01:34:23.968 --> 01:34:24.749]  It's 284 pages, but you can read it.
[01:34:27.205 --> 01:34:34.072]  The original ideation, 1999, and it was approved, as I say, in November of 2005 by the member banks.
[01:34:34.132 --> 01:34:36.514]  And, of course, the member banks included the Federal Reserve.
[01:34:36.554 --> 01:34:45.744]  So, here's the irony... Or I could just laugh at you that's done research, and say world banks don't exist, and giggle, and then I could go watch the Cowboys and listen to Britney Spears.
[01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:47.891]  Well, exactly.
[01:34:48.071 --> 01:34:49.312]  And you see, that's the way they'll do it.
[01:34:49.332 --> 01:34:54.397]  When we talk about one world currency, they can still call it the dollar, or the yen, or the euro.
[01:34:54.457 --> 01:34:55.838]  They can still have whatever prefix they want.
[01:34:55.858 --> 01:34:56.099]  That's right.
[01:34:56.139 --> 01:34:58.121]  At the international level, though, it's standardized.
[01:34:58.161 --> 01:34:58.781]  They control it.
[01:34:59.222 --> 01:35:00.183]  Read over that for folks.
[01:35:01.565 --> 01:35:02.326]  Well, exactly.
[01:35:02.446 --> 01:35:10.936]  So, we're again talking, here's the IMF in 2006, and they're referring back to what Basel is doing, and what they're saying, Basel II.
[01:35:11.336 --> 01:35:17.864]  Bank regulators expected some decline in minimum capital requirements after the shift to Basel II norms in 2009.
[01:35:19.295 --> 01:35:28.582]  They acknowledge that the impact on bank balance sheets is uncertain, in part because the role of the economic cycle would only become fully evident after the system was implemented.
[01:35:28.942 --> 01:35:31.103]  However, capital adequacy... Let's stop, let's stop, let's stop.
[01:35:31.123 --> 01:35:38.709]  See, they're changing capital requirements, and then leading up to 2009, they have to then gauge how bad this hurts us.
[01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:51.296]  As they consolidate, it's all written in lawyer speak, and that they would know in 2009, and now they do know, gauging their attack profile, their computer models, now they're fine-tuning with these G20 meetings.
[01:35:51.316 --> 01:35:51.916]  Please continue.
[01:35:53.075 --> 01:36:01.861]  Right, and they're saying capital adequacy standards could be recalibrated if necessary as the transition to the new framework will take place over several years.
[01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:05.564]  And so what they're really saying again is what we're saying about incrementalism.
[01:36:05.804 --> 01:36:09.767]  Well, we know in 2009 it's going to hit the fan, therefore we'll need to recalibrate it.
[01:36:10.167 --> 01:36:16.311]  And, you know, when you look at it and you say, this is 2006, yeah, but when you look at where they got it, this started in 99.
[01:36:18.715 --> 01:36:19.276]  Amazing.
[01:36:19.316 --> 01:36:28.204]  And so they're 10, 12 years ahead of this over and over and over again, 10 years from this date, but 12 years out from completion.
[01:36:28.524 --> 01:36:36.952]  And people will say, where's the world government when they're already issuing the new quantitative easing, their new super currency at bank-to-bank level backed up
[01:36:37.984 --> 01:36:38.965]  With our tax money.
[01:36:39.646 --> 01:36:43.150]  My God, Raleigh, how do we get the general public to understand this and realize this?
[01:36:43.170 --> 01:36:50.037]  Because the average good old boy making 200 grand a year, he thinks he's part of the power elite because he goes to a once a year luncheon with the governor.
[01:36:50.798 --> 01:36:57.385]  And so he psychologically thinks he's with the big boys and he's going to go right down the tubes the whole time thinking we're his enemy.
[01:36:58.993 --> 01:37:01.894]  Well, a lot of people are smug, thinking, well, that's all right.
[01:37:01.974 --> 01:37:03.614]  For instance, I'm just in gold.
[01:37:04.114 --> 01:37:07.795]  And what they're going to realize is that this control is complete.
[01:37:08.175 --> 01:37:15.217]  For instance, we look at gold prices, and all of us were saying gold should have been up past $2,000 an ounce by now, and we know something's going on.
[01:37:15.277 --> 01:37:21.899]  Well, something is going on, and that is that gold is being bought much like the mortgage securities were.
[01:37:22.687 --> 01:37:27.751]  And this is also by nations as well as financial entities, the Deutsche Bank for instance.
[01:37:28.111 --> 01:37:46.584]  We're looking at not only people buying fractional shares of gold, which everybody knows about, the ETFs of course, and that's an issue right there in terms of how much ETF versus how much gold Comex has, but you get beyond the ETF and you start to get into the ETN, and this is a gold derivative.
[01:37:46.854 --> 01:37:47.354]  We're good to go.
[01:38:07.816 --> 01:38:09.717]  But they think that there's a way around this.
[01:38:10.037 --> 01:38:12.718]  There is no way around this, but through it.
[01:38:13.018 --> 01:38:25.484]  And again, as I mentioned earlier with that statement, which in one way is hopeful in terms of we might have to adjust capital requirements and things of this nature, they want to continue to do it incrementally.
[01:38:25.564 --> 01:38:27.025]  Now, in terms of how you wake them up,
[01:38:27.674 --> 01:38:34.521]  Alex, you know better than anyone else because the thing about your films is there is an entertainment component as well.
[01:38:34.801 --> 01:38:40.386]  Not saying you're doing a soft shoe, but the idea that you're presenting it in an entertaining and compelling manner.
[01:38:40.746 --> 01:38:49.795]  If I were to read, you know, let alone Basil II, if I were just to read an IMF accord, people would be asleep by the third page if they weren't by the third sentence.
[01:38:50.290 --> 01:38:56.115]  So it is, it must be done in a way that it's entertaining and also in a way that it's relatable.
[01:38:56.436 --> 01:39:01.460]  So people understand, like we were saying about the internet for instance, it's the same exact deal here.
[01:39:02.101 --> 01:39:05.364]  Frame it as free market or frame it as a trade agreement.
[01:39:05.404 --> 01:39:05.865]  Exactly!
[01:39:06.325 --> 01:39:07.426]  Well, I mean, take the establishment.
[01:39:07.486 --> 01:39:08.607]  They do everything that they do.
[01:39:08.667 --> 01:39:10.129]  Very boring, very dry.
[01:39:10.469 --> 01:39:13.272]  But if you know the lawyer language, it's horrifying to read what they're saying.
[01:39:13.512 --> 01:39:15.273]  But they say it to calm you.
[01:39:15.333 --> 01:39:16.094]  It's no big deal.
[01:39:16.154 --> 01:39:17.896]  It's some dirty, old, gray paper.
[01:39:18.296 --> 01:39:19.037]  Don't look at it.
[01:39:19.437 --> 01:39:21.119]  Never mind that sports stadium.
[01:39:21.139 --> 01:39:22.220]  Never mind that FEMA account.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.061]  Never mind this or that.
[01:39:23.381 --> 01:39:24.322]  Never mind these bills.
[01:39:24.682 --> 01:39:25.423]  Everything's fine.
[01:39:25.743 --> 01:39:27.004]  They speak to our laziness.
[01:39:28.021 --> 01:39:34.904]  But we're designed to be like humans, where a saber-toothed cat comes running up to us and it's got big fangs and is growling, so that's what gets us moving.
[01:39:35.364 --> 01:39:43.026]  And so when I show my film and play ominous music, when I show some build, say band guns, well, it is ominous.
[01:39:43.147 --> 01:39:45.487]  So, you know, that's how we take things in.
[01:39:45.527 --> 01:39:47.248]  I'm going to put the spooky music in there.
[01:39:47.608 --> 01:39:48.488]  That's what they do.
[01:39:48.508 --> 01:39:50.009]  They always criticize me for that.
[01:39:50.309 --> 01:39:51.149]  That's what they do.
[01:39:51.329 --> 01:39:52.330]  But I take the truth.
[01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:55.912]  And then put it with the music or the images I think, you know, fit with it.
[01:39:56.252 --> 01:40:02.236]  They take their lies and then they'll take something horrible and put happy music on it to sell the horrible.
[01:40:02.616 --> 01:40:05.498]  I'll take something horrible and put horrible music on it.
[01:40:05.538 --> 01:40:06.159]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:40:07.446 --> 01:40:18.416]  And that's exactly what you have to do, because if you don't have that, what some people will criticize you for, the glitz and the glamour, if you don't have that, you're going to lose the people you're trying to awaken, because it's in multi-steps.
[01:40:18.456 --> 01:40:25.803]  Again, first you awaken them, and then they'll go into, well, there's a workaround for me, because everybody believes that it won't happen to them.
[01:40:26.203 --> 01:40:29.186]  And as they start to see that there's a workaround for nobody,
[01:40:29.659 --> 01:40:31.041]  That's when they start to realize.
[01:40:31.061 --> 01:40:33.103]  That's why I brought up gold a minute ago.
[01:40:33.163 --> 01:40:41.453]  You know, even without looking at the derivatives, if you just look at the fractional shares, right now the COMEX is trading about 32 million ounces of gold.
[01:40:41.493 --> 01:40:43.495]  They only have 8.5 million back in it.
[01:40:43.916 --> 01:40:47.900]  And again, we're not even getting to those true derivatives here.
[01:40:48.781 --> 01:40:55.167]  Anybody who thinks, well, I've got my cave and I've got my victory garden, you know, think again!
[01:40:55.187 --> 01:41:04.695]  And they're not getting rid, absolutely, they're not getting rid of derivatives because that's the big fiat weapon they use to manipulate stock markets, take over governments.
[01:41:05.055 --> 01:41:14.544]  It's the tsunami of liquid made-up fiat currency that everybody accepts because they're the scammers around the governments that they're using to buy up the world.
[01:41:15.984 --> 01:41:16.465]  Well, sure.
[01:41:16.805 --> 01:41:24.375]  In the fourth annual BIS conference, one of the things that came out of it was that they wanted to influence asset prices.
[01:41:24.475 --> 01:41:31.785]  William White from the BIS, when he was talking about central bank cooperation, which of course is central bank takeover... Gang raping!
[01:41:32.944 --> 01:41:33.464]  Right, of course.
[01:41:33.605 --> 01:41:54.298]  In his fourth plank, he was saying the efficient international dissemination of ideas and information that improves national policymaking is a factor, but at last, the provision of international credits and joint efforts to influence asset prices, especially gold and foreign exchange, in circumstances where this might be thought useful is the key.
[01:41:55.439 --> 01:41:56.199]  Oh, it's sickening.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:57.981]  Well, all of their
[01:41:59.099 --> 01:42:00.560]  Lipstick on the pig, as they say.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:05.062]  All of that is not working anymore because reality is setting into people.
[01:42:05.702 --> 01:42:13.585]  And the globalists, as you know, Raleigh, but some people may not know this out there, bragged that they're bringing the economy down by design because we're living too well, the free market's not good.
[01:42:13.886 --> 01:42:15.886]  These big bankers admit they're monopoly men.
[01:42:15.906 --> 01:42:16.927]  They don't want free market.
[01:42:16.947 --> 01:42:18.908]  They love communism, socialism, fascism.
[01:42:19.708 --> 01:42:26.230]  And so I just want the public to know, this is all by design, and in a way we deserve it.
[01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:29.691]  I mean, we've been fat, dumb, and happy, Raleigh, and so what do you expect?
[01:42:31.432 --> 01:42:31.912]  Agreed.
[01:42:32.052 --> 01:42:38.094]  In fact, what people need to understand is that many people think that this is kumbaya cooperation.
[01:42:38.394 --> 01:42:42.755]  This is not cooperation, this is control on a level that people have never seen before.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:51.002]  It's a bunch of rich fat cats running scams teaming up together and literally like a gang beating the daylights out of us if we're lucky.
[01:42:51.803 --> 01:42:54.563]  Raleigh James, we'll take a few calls in the final segment straight ahead.
[01:42:55.004 --> 01:42:55.664]  Raleigh.net.
[01:42:56.424 --> 01:42:59.705]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:42:59.945 --> 01:43:04.266]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[01:43:04.467 --> 01:43:12.329]  It's called Proto Grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:15.492]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:43:15.772 --> 01:43:23.319]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:43:23.419 --> 01:43:28.984]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:43:29.224 --> 01:43:34.786]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:43:35.066 --> 01:43:38.368]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:43:38.608 --> 01:43:41.969]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:47.252]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief Superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:43:47.272 --> 01:43:50.133]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:43:50.153 --> 01:43:50.353]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:43:56.761 --> 01:43:59.330]  In the New World Order's war against humanity.
[01:43:59.958 --> 01:44:02.080]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:08.145]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:08.685 --> 01:44:14.870]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:15.190 --> 01:44:16.992]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:17.152 --> 01:44:19.534]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:19.614 --> 01:44:29.362]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[01:44:29.813 --> 01:44:30.513]  That's fascist.
[01:44:32.794 --> 01:44:34.055]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:34.455 --> 01:44:35.855]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:36.315 --> 01:44:42.658]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:43.218 --> 01:44:51.001]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:51.481 --> 01:44:52.641]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:53.061 --> 01:44:54.262]  The people strike back.
[01:44:55.871 --> 01:44:58.894]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[01:44:59.274 --> 01:45:03.499]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[01:45:03.699 --> 01:45:05.881]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[01:45:06.221 --> 01:45:12.187]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[01:45:12.488 --> 01:45:18.854]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[01:45:20.055 --> 01:45:22.077]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[01:45:29.683 --> 01:45:31.584]  You know, you work hard for your money.

[01:46:07.409 --> 01:46:09.770]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[01:46:10.471 --> 01:46:14.533]  It was back when the country was strong.
[01:46:19.396 --> 01:46:20.877]  Back before Elvis.
[01:46:20.897 --> 01:46:24.379]  Let's take a few calls for Raleigh James and a good talk to your host.
[01:46:24.399 --> 01:46:27.301]  Gotta have you back more than once or twice a year, it's always great.
[01:46:27.721 --> 01:46:30.283]  Margaret in British Columbia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:46:31.163 --> 01:46:33.685]  Hey Alex, thanks, um, just a great show.
[01:46:35.151 --> 01:46:41.816]  Um, I didn't listen to your radio until about six months ago, and I totally agree with your guess.
[01:46:41.956 --> 01:46:42.916]  You get blown away.
[01:46:42.996 --> 01:46:45.078]  I didn't know of the BIS and CFR.
[01:46:46.719 --> 01:46:47.880]  Information is power.
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:47:02.450]  And about three weeks ago, I live on a little island here in BC, and I couldn't believe that a lot of the information, but about three weeks ago, they had, uh, the RCMP here were coming to do, um,
[01:47:06.394 --> 01:47:10.337]  Well, they said they were going to be doing security for Whistler, which they will be for the Olympics.
[01:47:10.377 --> 01:47:11.717]  Now, that's the federal police.
[01:47:12.558 --> 01:47:13.018]  That's right.
[01:47:13.439 --> 01:47:17.821]  And now they have their regular army patrolling the streets of Canada, just like here.
[01:47:18.562 --> 01:47:23.205]  Well, and at the same time, I found out that our government has allowed the U.S.
[01:47:23.925 --> 01:47:27.167]  to come in 23 kilometers as a border patrol thing.
[01:47:27.948 --> 01:47:29.629]  But in the meantime, they were coming over.
[01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:32.571]  We're a small island, about a thousand population.
[01:47:33.641 --> 01:47:36.483]  And so everybody, the B&Bs and the restaurants all hear about it.
[01:47:37.483 --> 01:47:41.366]  But I was really surprised because the second day that they were here, the U.S.
[01:47:41.426 --> 01:47:42.366]  military showed up.
[01:47:44.027 --> 01:47:48.170]  So I don't know, it'll be soon when they'll be checking us at our roadblocks.
[01:47:49.008 --> 01:47:50.389]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:47:50.469 --> 01:47:50.790]  No, no.
[01:47:51.130 --> 01:47:55.534]  They signed deals over the last decade, but a big one last year and Congress said, we weren't informed.
[01:47:56.415 --> 01:48:03.742]  And Raleigh, it's really happening to use Mexican and Canadian troops here, and our troops there, and their OPENORTHCOMS now in Canada.
[01:48:05.382 --> 01:48:05.922]  Absolutely.
[01:48:06.422 --> 01:48:10.224]  And when the Canadians heard about it, some of them went crazy as well.
[01:48:10.304 --> 01:48:14.146]  These were signed without any knowledge of the general public.
[01:48:14.446 --> 01:48:15.606]  And sure, it's going that way.
[01:48:15.866 --> 01:48:17.587]  But unfortunately, you know, B.C.
[01:48:17.727 --> 01:48:21.469]  is a real great laboratory for this, because there is a carbon tax.
[01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:27.451]  And you have things like the Vancouver Sun backing up everything that is global or social.
[01:48:27.831 --> 01:48:30.712]  And you're starting to see, like the woman who called, a disconnect.
[01:48:30.752 --> 01:48:31.993]  And that's very healthy.
[01:48:33.456 --> 01:48:36.978]  But I mean, the globalists have been denying world government.
[01:48:37.018 --> 01:48:39.760]  Now they're kind of admitting a little bit, but so much is still hidden.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:41.081]  We see it because we study it.
[01:48:41.581 --> 01:48:44.223]  What's going to happen when they try to come right out with all of it?
[01:48:44.243 --> 01:48:53.769]  They're already kind of going, more than one child is bad for the carbon footprint, and we may have to watch your neighbors and you, and we may have to... But I mean, what's going to happen when they kind of unveil even more?
[01:48:53.869 --> 01:48:55.150]  The public's already this mad.
[01:48:55.691 --> 01:48:58.092]  What's going to happen when they find out this is real tyranny?
[01:48:58.112 --> 01:49:00.494]  This isn't just some boss hog corruption.
[01:49:02.099 --> 01:49:21.314]  Well, in terms of that, if you're thinking, well, people will awaken to the point that they will want to overthrow the government, to some degree, that is the dream of those who want to control us, because the early stages of that would be martial law and would be that bootstrap and would be, as an example... So what is the last minute, Raleigh, and we're out of time, and I'll be back this Sunday, folks, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:49:21.334 --> 01:49:25.377]  Central, and you'll be on the 9 to midnight on XM stations.
[01:49:25.978 --> 01:49:27.379]  Raleigh, what is the solution to one minute?
[01:49:29.306 --> 01:49:32.989]  Awakening and being involved, exactly what you're doing, one person at a time.
[01:49:33.069 --> 01:49:35.771]  I wish it was sexy, I wish there was a way to do it another way.
[01:49:35.851 --> 01:49:46.858]  People want this great key and this great answer, but it's information, and it is starting to understand, be aware, believe, and telling the guy next to you one person at a time, and that's what your movies do very well.
[01:49:47.118 --> 01:49:47.899]  And saying no.
[01:49:47.919 --> 01:49:49.240]  I agree with you.
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:51.602]  I mean, people keep looking for some magic silver bullet.
[01:49:51.882 --> 01:49:52.702]  It's saying no.
[01:49:52.762 --> 01:49:54.083]  I mean, police, military?
[01:49:54.544 --> 01:49:55.885]  Are you going to follow these illegal orders?
[01:49:55.965 --> 01:49:57.766]  Obama says it's okay to torture if it's an order.
[01:49:59.079 --> 01:50:01.520]  Right, but it's got to get to that headcount where it's the sweet point.
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:02.821]  You and I say no, we're nuts.
[01:50:03.121 --> 01:50:05.142]  Ten million people say no, they're a force.
[01:50:05.722 --> 01:50:06.502]  I think we're getting there.
[01:50:06.522 --> 01:50:09.443]  That's why the neocons are trying to co-opt the Tea Party movement.
[01:50:09.803 --> 01:50:11.104]  Raleigh James, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:11.164 --> 01:50:13.445]  Raleigh, R-O-L-L-Y-E dot net.
[01:50:13.825 --> 01:50:16.346]  Up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:50:17.507 --> 01:50:18.767]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:19.407 --> 01:50:20.268]  I went into torture.
[01:50:20.348 --> 01:50:21.708]  Key information in the first hour.
[01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:23.349]  Restarts now on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:23.769 --> 01:50:25.830]  Hope all of you will continue listening.
[01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:27.111]  God bless you, Raleigh.
[01:50:27.131 --> 01:50:27.691]  Good having you on.
[01:50:29.079 --> 01:50:29.939]  It's been an honor and a pleasure.
[01:50:29.979 --> 01:50:30.160]  Thanks.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.600]  It's always an honor to have you on.
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:32.861]  Thanks for all your help and research.
[01:50:33.181 --> 01:50:34.281]  That's a great talk show.
[01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:35.282]  Super informed.
[01:50:35.562 --> 01:50:36.883]  There's not many like her.
[01:50:36.923 --> 01:50:38.283]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:38.323 --> 01:50:42.145]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:46.104 --> 01:50:47.686]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:47.786 --> 01:50:52.432]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:52.532 --> 01:50:55.296]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:55.496 --> 01:50:58.360]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:04.388]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:51:04.608 --> 01:51:07.551]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:07.851 --> 01:51:14.758]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:14.838 --> 01:51:17.982]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:18.122 --> 01:51:19.063]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the website
