[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.653]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:11.233]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:12.154]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:16.976]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:25.721]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:28.783]  Alright, got a big show lined up for you today.
[00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:34.186]  You know, I didn't bug Jesse Ventura the last six months or so.
[00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:38.828]  I know he was busy shooting three different TV pilots.
[00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:43.309]  One of which I'm involved with at a certain level.
[00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.471]  And also, his wife had a family member dying of cancer.
[00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:50.632]  And so he's a really busy guy.
[00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:55.594]  So I wanted to give him some space to go down to Mexico to do some surfing, but he ended up never being able to go down there.
[00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:58.855]  So I went ahead and called him up this morning and he said, yeah, I'll come on today.
[00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:09.589]  But his schedule is such he's only going to be on for 30 minutes and then coming up the Monday after next, he'll be with us for a full hour to talk about a host of issues.
[00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:16.433]  So, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, who you've seen making the rounds on CNN, Fox, MSNBC, The View.
[00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:19.273]  Talking about waterboarding.
[00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:21.295]  You know, actually, we need to go pull up.
[00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:22.796]  I know Aaron Dyches is here.
[00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:23.577]  He talked about it.
[00:01:23.577 --> 00:01:26.279]  He first told that waterboarding story.
[00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:28.801]  Driving around with us in the car, we videotaped it.
[00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:37.369]  And I don't think we ever even aired that, where Ventura... Paul, where Ventura tells the waterboarding story.
[00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.732]  Will you ask Aaron to go grab that out of his computer files?
[00:01:40.732 --> 00:01:43.034]  It's Jesse Ventura.
[00:01:43.034 --> 00:01:44.155]  Aaron will have it.
[00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:45.115]  It's Jesse Ventura.
[00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:57.793]  Um, when he was in Austin last October, driving around with us in the car, talking about how they were waterboarded in, uh, underwater demolition training.
[00:01:57.793 --> 00:02:03.577]  Because what their escape and evasion or capture escape and evasion training.
[00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:05.117]  I forget the exact name of it.
[00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:05.978]  It's Sears training.
[00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.637]  And just how completely worthless it would be to actually get real answers out of people.
[00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:15.999]  All it's good for is getting false confessions.
[00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:21.083]  So I just hung up the phone with Ventura, had a nice 15-minute discussion with him about a lot of stuff.
[00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:22.724]  A lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[00:02:22.724 --> 00:02:26.446]  We have not heard the last of former Minnesota Governor
[00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:33.147]  Jesse Ventura, movie star turned 9-11 truther turned anti-New World Order activist.
[00:02:33.147 --> 00:02:37.728]  And Ventura has now gone down the rabbit hole since I talked to him six months ago.
[00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:47.210]  Well, I guess I talked to him in November, too, but five and a half, six months ago.
[00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.372]  And so he has definitely learned a lot more about the New World Order since I first gave him a copy of Terror Storm.
[00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:56.331]  What was it?
[00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:57.551]  Two and a half, three years ago.
[00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:59.792]  Terror Storm had just come out.
[00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:07.454]  And he was down here in Central Texas and had a chance to meet him and he'd already seen some of my work from his son.
[00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:11.676]  And his son had also just given him loose change.
[00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:17.257]  And I gave him a copy of Terror Storm.
[00:03:17.257 --> 00:03:19.678]  And he certainly went down the rabbit hole from that point on.
[00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:30.527]  And that's another example of how we can go out to influential people who are not evil, who are not servants of the New World Order, and wake them up to what's happening in the wider world.
[00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:34.028]  You know, we woke up Bruce Willis.
[00:03:34.028 --> 00:03:37.389]  Rick Linklater broke that here on air.
[00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.630]  People can say, ah, who cares about Bruce Willis or Jesse Ventura?
[00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.691]  Well, the establishment, the media does.
[00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:47.613]  I mean, you know, they'll pay these guys tens of millions of dollars to pitch products because the public pays attention.
[00:03:50.123 --> 00:03:55.206]  And so it's great to have influential former governors and movie stars and people waking up.
[00:03:55.206 --> 00:04:00.090]  It's great to have Keanu Reeves giving, you know, talks down to the media about the New World Order.
[00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.032]  It's great to have George Lucas coming out against the New World Order.
[00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:08.715]  It's great to have Charlie Sheen come out against the New World Order.
[00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:09.396]  It's wonderful.
[00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:17.221]  I mean, if I tried to list all the prominent people coming out and speaking out against the New World Order, it would take an hour to go over them all.
[00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:19.723]  There's so many, I can't even think of them all at one time.
[00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:27.792]  And so that's another example of what this radio show and my films are doing thanks to you!
[00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:29.033]  You!
[00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:31.255]  Spreading the word and taking action.
[00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:32.616]  It's having a huge effect.
[00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:38.162]  Rand Paul, son of Ron Paul, getting set to run for Congress, run for the Senate.
[00:04:38.162 --> 00:04:41.125]  He's coming up in T-minus 25 minutes.
[00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:45.389]  Then I'll give you an update on one of my employees' daughters that CPS tried to kidnap.
[00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:46.050]  Strip-searched her.
[00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:50.278]  Hays County's whining their entire government phone systems were shut down.
[00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:54.564]  They probably weren't able to kidnap kids for a few hours.
[00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:58.850]  And, uh, or raid marijuana smokers with SWAT teams and shoot them or anything.
[00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.592]  We'll talk about it all.
[00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:09.282]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:05:09.282 --> 00:05:14.147]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:19.333]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:06.458]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:13.129]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:19.613]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:21.614]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:24.056]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:06:24.056 --> 00:06:34.943]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.248 --> 00:06:38.909]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.771]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:47.676]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:55.943]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.943 --> 00:06:57.524]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.524 --> 00:06:58.705]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.753]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:07:04.753 --> 00:07:07.314]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:07:07.314 --> 00:07:16.840]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.182]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:07:23.182 --> 00:07:25.883]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:07:25.883 --> 00:07:35.586]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years, and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:36.486]  Let's do it!
[00:08:00.989 --> 00:08:11.074]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:21.319]  Okay, we got Daryl Rundis, great guy, come in the studio to talk about a host of issues in Romans 13, how the churches in this country are controlled by the globalists.
[00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:26.948]  Jesse Ventura, the last 30 minutes of the show today, making big headlines everywhere.
[00:08:26.948 --> 00:08:33.593]  There's comments about waterboarding and a lot more, and about indicting, prosecuting the Bush administration.
[00:08:33.593 --> 00:08:35.694]  So he'll be on the show today as well.
[00:08:35.694 --> 00:08:46.323]  Rand Paul, getting ready to run for political office, son of the illustrious Dr. Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul, will be joining us coming up later in this hour as well.
[00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:50.316]  And in the next hour, we will have open phones.
[00:08:50.316 --> 00:09:11.463]  Look, I want to thank the listeners for tens of thousands of phone calls to YouTube and the parent company, Google, because that made them contact us and point out that we should just file in federal court that these were false copyright claims that had been filed to bring down
[00:09:14.062 --> 00:09:15.864]  Bring down the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[00:09:15.864 --> 00:09:16.645]  And we did that.
[00:09:16.645 --> 00:09:18.087]  I wrote a briefing.
[00:09:18.087 --> 00:09:20.029]  Wrote a federal filing.
[00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:21.711]  And most of these are not successful.
[00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:22.812]  You can read the history of these.
[00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:26.456]  We were successful because I cited precedent and some other things.
[00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:30.721]  But it was your phone calls that definitely got Google's attention.
[00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:42.495]  There's some complexities to that I'm not going to get into, but the issue is we had a success there and millions more people will now every week see the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:09:42.495 --> 00:09:45.337]  Just one out post on the front lines of the Info War.
[00:09:45.337 --> 00:09:47.999]  Make no mistake, YouTube is the very front line.
[00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:50.061]  That's where we're reaching many of the new people we reach.
[00:09:51.496 --> 00:09:53.937]  We are not speaking to the choir here.
[00:09:53.937 --> 00:09:58.238]  They take the audio of this show, the video, and we simulcast it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:58.238 --> 00:10:15.563]  They slap it up there, all over the internet, and it's just having an unbelievable effect, not just on YouTube, but YouTube is the big kahuna, bigger than all video sites combined, and we are waging war on corruption and the New World Order on YouTube, and reaching tens of thousands, conservatively, of new people every day.
[00:10:15.563 --> 00:10:16.623]  So I salute you!
[00:10:18.567 --> 00:10:24.110]  Now, I have an employee in here, Monday I get off the air, she's crying.
[00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.011]  CPS says she can't have her daughter, they're gonna come take her.
[00:10:27.011 --> 00:10:30.053]  She had a little bruise halfway down her thigh.
[00:10:30.053 --> 00:10:36.216]  Then it turns out they strip-searched her, had police there telling her you're gonna get in trouble if you don't.
[00:10:36.216 --> 00:10:38.597]  It shut down the Hays County phone system according to them.
[00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:40.698]  They're such liars, who knows what the truth is.
[00:10:43.132 --> 00:10:49.380]  And so later in the next hour, I'll spend about five minutes thanking everybody, for now, because who knows what's going to come up in the future, but I want to thank everybody.
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.084]  For now, it looks like we're backing them off.
[00:10:53.084 --> 00:10:54.366]  And I'll tell you what's happening with that.
[00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:58.110]  But, you know, there's all these cops in the Austin American Statesman in the comment page.
[00:10:59.068 --> 00:11:05.690]  Under the article that we're linked to up on Infowars.com going, oh Alex Jones wants children to be abused.
[00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.311]  You know, I remember when we were going through the academy.
[00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:14.473]  When I was going through the academy, you can tell these are, you know, cops in Austin and Hays County, and they admit they are.
[00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:18.914]  Yeah, Alex said all those cops got chips in our heads that we got at the academy.
[00:11:18.914 --> 00:11:20.735]  I never said that, that's a straw man.
[00:11:23.075 --> 00:11:28.178]  I read mainstream news articles how they want to chip the military out of BBC and Associated Press.
[00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:29.279]  And I read Army documents.
[00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:31.020]  But see, that's what you do.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:45.228]  Instead of talking about why are schools strip-searching little girls without their parents being notified, with police threatening them they'll get in trouble if they don't, instead of you facing up to the type of stuff you're doing all over this country, and it's all over the news that goes on,
[00:11:45.908 --> 00:11:47.428]  Not just in this case.
[00:11:47.428 --> 00:11:54.009]  You sit there and you make jokes, and you lie about me, and say I said... See, you're lying to yourselves right there.
[00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:56.190]  Do you believe the crap you're shoveling?
[00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.310]  Do you believe the baloney you're putting out?
[00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.811]  They had the Hays County Sheriff's spokesman on local radio saying I'm a liar.
[00:12:03.811 --> 00:12:06.892]  Now they're trying to claim that they didn't even strip search her.
[00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:10.432]  But we have the CPS and others in previous statements admitting that they did.
[00:12:10.432 --> 00:12:13.293]  They're calling it a medical examination, taking her pants off.
[00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:16.126]  And the statesman caught you in those lies.
[00:12:16.126 --> 00:12:20.268]  I was talking to the statesman reporter yesterday and he goes, yeah, they did say that earlier, now they're saying this.
[00:12:20.268 --> 00:12:22.849]  Pretty soon you'll say you didn't even talk to the little girl.
[00:12:22.849 --> 00:12:26.972]  Pretty soon you'll say Little Haley doesn't exist.
[00:12:26.972 --> 00:12:29.553]  Pretty soon you'll say Buda Elementary doesn't exist.
[00:12:29.553 --> 00:12:30.994]  Hayes County doesn't exist.
[00:12:30.994 --> 00:12:32.254]  Texas doesn't exist.
[00:12:32.254 --> 00:12:33.755]  The United States doesn't exist.
[00:12:33.755 --> 00:12:34.936]  The planet doesn't exist.
[00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:41.514]  Your double-think mind tricks don't work on us anymore.
[00:12:41.514 --> 00:12:43.115]  We're breaking our conditioning.
[00:12:43.115 --> 00:12:47.759]  We're not listening to your double-talk anymore.
[00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:55.064]  And I had TV crews here yesterday and they were saying, was this
[00:12:57.705 --> 00:13:04.668]  Unreasonable and dangerous for you to do, giving out government phone numbers and the Hays County says you gave out their 911.
[00:13:04.668 --> 00:13:06.409]  And I said, I didn't give out 911.
[00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:09.750]  You don't, you don't get on national radio and say, call 911.
[00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.310]  That wouldn't even go to Hays County.
[00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:18.773]  I gave the administrative offices of the County Commissioners, the City of Beauty.
[00:13:18.773 --> 00:13:19.694]  The City of Beauty.
[00:13:19.694 --> 00:13:22.595]  I suddenly can't talk today because I'm so hyped up.
[00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:24.876]  The City of Buda, the City Council.
[00:13:26.923 --> 00:13:28.924]  And the Police Department Administrative Numbers.
[00:13:28.924 --> 00:13:29.964]  And that's all on record.
[00:13:29.964 --> 00:13:33.945]  Now, I said, go listen to the MP3 of the show.
[00:13:33.945 --> 00:13:35.686]  So, see, that's what the police always do.
[00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:38.007]  They always try to put it off on somebody else.
[00:13:38.007 --> 00:13:39.487]  Oh, we didn't, we weren't there.
[00:13:39.487 --> 00:13:40.527]  We didn't strip search her.
[00:13:40.527 --> 00:13:42.068]  We don't know about any strip search.
[00:13:42.068 --> 00:13:43.709]  First, it was we weren't part of the strip search.
[00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:46.109]  Then, I know nothing.
[00:13:46.109 --> 00:13:48.250]  To the best of our knowledge, there was no strip search.
[00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.431]  You know, next, they would have told us that their squad car videos weren't working either.
[00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.072]  Kind of like in the latest Austin shooting.
[00:13:55.899 --> 00:14:09.847]  I mean, I've seen two cases now in the last week of police running up to a suspect with his, laying on the ground with his hands out in supplication, in prostration, prostrate, before them.
[00:14:09.847 --> 00:14:11.288]  You know, submission.
[00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:23.835]  And the police, with all their power, boot kick the head, head flies back, blood starts coming out, and the police DAs and people come out on the news and say, oh, this was just adjusting the positioning of his head.
[00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:27.219]  So I guess now they stomp your head in and kill you.
[00:14:27.219 --> 00:14:29.521]  It's just positioning.
[00:14:29.521 --> 00:14:30.822]  Maybe they cut your arm off.
[00:14:30.822 --> 00:14:31.902]  It's merely a flesh wound.
[00:14:31.902 --> 00:14:41.590]  All right, I'm already digressing into Babel.
[00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:42.150]  Gold's up at $943.
[00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.013]  So what, gold is up $63 in the last three weeks.
[00:14:45.013 --> 00:14:46.174]  Hmm, making a move.
[00:14:53.663 --> 00:14:57.204]  And they'll probably try to suppress the price again, but they're not going to be able to do it forever.
[00:14:57.204 --> 00:15:07.986]  China, Russia, Venezuela, Brazil, they're all dumping the dollar right now.
[00:15:07.986 --> 00:15:14.368]  All I can say is, get ready for rough financial times ahead, and that's putting it lightly.
[00:15:14.368 --> 00:15:19.809]  Anyways, I digress.
[00:15:19.809 --> 00:15:22.630]  We got Jesse Ventura coming up, as I said, that should be interesting.
[00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:28.616]  Okay.
[00:15:28.616 --> 00:15:31.237]  Let me give you some of the headlines I've got here in front of me.
[00:15:31.237 --> 00:15:56.126]  Obviously, we're going to talk about the big press conference that I watched as I was jogging on the treadmill this morning with President Barack H. Obama up there engaged in levels of double-think, double-speak, double-talk, duplicity, lies, disinformation,
[00:15:57.276 --> 00:15:59.578]  That will bamboozle a bunch of other people.
[00:15:59.578 --> 00:16:06.284]  And then when people point out, in a year from now, that they're holding secret detainees, including U.S.
[00:16:06.284 --> 00:16:17.193]  citizens, in the United States and other countries, and that he's continuing indefinite secret detention, he's announced all that in his executive order, second day in office.
[00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:19.975]  I mean, that's why it's all in the Obama deception.
[00:16:19.975 --> 00:16:23.378]  He just keeps repeating the same trick over and over again.
[00:16:23.378 --> 00:16:25.980]  You see the Obama deception, you have their entire game plan.
[00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:35.665]  And, uh, but for an average person that hasn't studied the enemy and how they operate, he is the latest generation of lying, though.
[00:16:35.665 --> 00:16:38.891]  I mean, I've never seen double-talk this slick.
[00:16:38.891 --> 00:16:40.614]  It's only slick, though, if you're uninformed.
[00:16:42.417 --> 00:16:43.678]  If you're informed, it's a big joke.
[00:16:43.678 --> 00:16:52.104]  So before I break that down right now, I want to just give you another example that is now public knowledge that he got caught on.
[00:16:52.104 --> 00:16:53.725]  One of the few things he got caught on.
[00:16:53.725 --> 00:17:01.070]  I mean, he's been caught on every front line if you look at what he's done, but still the public widely knows he lied about this.
[00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:07.334]  He's been caught even by the sheep public on this issue.
[00:17:07.334 --> 00:17:11.337]  And he's being caught on the secret arrest, no right for detainees, indefinite detention,
[00:17:12.236 --> 00:17:13.257]  Torture.
[00:17:13.257 --> 00:17:20.643]  He's being caught on that, so that's what this is, is damage control, and him and Cheney engaged in some political theater.
[00:17:20.643 --> 00:17:23.645]  All choreographed, all scripted on the teleprompters.
[00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:24.526]  Both sides.
[00:17:24.526 --> 00:17:26.867]  Obama works for the people that run Bush.
[00:17:26.867 --> 00:17:33.953]  They confer together, they hug, they have phone calls weekly, it's all... He's protecting Bush, it's completely staged.
[00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:37.276]  He's got his defense secretary, the entire crew.
[00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:47.116]  There's more Bush people in the administration than there are, uh, that's Bush 41 and Clinton people than there are that Obama brought in.
[00:17:47.116 --> 00:17:50.297]  So, here's an example of a scam you know about.
[00:17:50.297 --> 00:18:03.144]  Even if you're a mainline, new listener to the show, who thinks Rush Limbaugh's conservative and Bill Clinton's liberal and they all love you and want to take care of you, instead of they all are for the New World Order.
[00:18:03.144 --> 00:18:05.285]  So let me break this down for you.
[00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:05.805]  Remember
[00:18:07.091 --> 00:18:20.635]  Obama coming out and saying he was angry about the banker bailout, and he was going to get to the bottom of CEO bonuses and compensation to executives in the tens of billions of dollars.
[00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:25.637]  And then, he had already signed the executive order, so this was in the Obama deception out two months ago.
[00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:29.078]  And this only broke a month ago, because I don't have to read the executive order.
[00:18:29.078 --> 00:18:31.379]  I don't need mainstream media to tell me something.
[00:18:31.379 --> 00:18:34.120]  So we break down exactly what later came out in the news in the film.
[00:18:36.744 --> 00:18:38.065]  I know how to read an executive order.
[00:18:38.065 --> 00:18:59.020]  That executive order said that anyone who previously signed a deal with the October 3rd Banker Takeover, in perpetuity forward, couldn't be investigated, couldn't be audited, and they could have any bonuses or any money they wanted and spend it however they wanted.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.261]  But that wasn't enough for them.
[00:19:03.732 --> 00:19:05.413]  He signed an executive order saying that.
[00:19:05.413 --> 00:19:29.430]  Then he pressured Senator Dodd, and Dodd's on record saying this, the White House has had to admit it, to pass a rider on the $887 billion stimulus package stating that all the major banks and brokerage firms were exempt from even getting money out of the stimulus package for CEO and executive bonuses and pay.
[00:19:32.062 --> 00:19:36.464]  And then Obama came out and gave speeches against it, and people went, wait a minute.
[00:19:36.464 --> 00:19:42.747]  They started blaming Senator Dodd for it, throwing him to the wolves, his minion, his former colleague.
[00:19:42.747 --> 00:19:46.509]  And Dodd came out and said, you told me to do this, you signed the orders.
[00:19:46.509 --> 00:19:50.491]  And the executive, I just got past the accompanying legislative.
[00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:53.112]  See, that's what's going on with this torture business.
[00:19:53.112 --> 00:19:58.675]  He is behind it all, while paying lip service that he's fighting it.
[00:19:58.675 --> 00:19:59.375]  We'll break it down.
[00:20:05.942 --> 00:20:10.984]  Have you ever noticed that celebrities are endorsing weight loss products and health aids?
[00:20:10.984 --> 00:20:14.806]  Do you think they endorse these products for free?
[00:20:14.806 --> 00:20:15.787]  I don't think so.
[00:20:15.787 --> 00:20:19.848]  I'm here to tell you, I'm not a celebrity and Life Change T doesn't need one.
[00:20:19.848 --> 00:20:23.090]  Think about this, the product speaks for itself!
[00:20:23.718 --> 00:20:25.259]  What a concept!
[00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:26.859]  Our product works.
[00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:29.420]  You get healthy and you'll lose weight.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.280]  Summer's coming.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.821]  Look and feel good.

[00:20:33.421 --> 00:20:33.561]  928-308-0408.

[00:20:49.526 --> 00:20:54.248]  But the excess around your, uh... Anyway, Life Change Tea.
[00:20:54.248 --> 00:20:55.768]  It speaks for itself.
[00:20:55.768 --> 00:21:00.810]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.912]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[00:21:03.912 --> 00:21:10.934]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[00:21:10.934 --> 00:21:15.156]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.

[00:21:25.725 --> 00:21:35.788]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[00:21:35.788 --> 00:21:37.588]  Call me Duane Daly at 800-686-2237 extension 115
[00:21:41.409 --> 00:21:47.111]  To start your protection of wealth today, I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.

[00:22:00.735 --> 00:22:05.957]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.531 --> 00:22:14.096]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.096 --> 00:22:20.641]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.641 --> 00:22:22.682]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.682 --> 00:22:25.184]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.184 --> 00:22:36.131]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:36.736 --> 00:22:38.417]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.417 --> 00:22:40.278]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.278 --> 00:22:47.183]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:24:11.761 --> 00:24:16.602]  Is it getting better?
[00:24:16.602 --> 00:24:21.923]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:24:21.923 --> 00:24:25.844]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[00:24:25.844 --> 00:24:28.765]  But you got someone to blame.
[00:24:28.765 --> 00:24:35.066]  You got George Bush to blame for the secret arrest and the secret torture.
[00:24:35.066 --> 00:24:36.707]  The Patriot Act being used on U.S.
[00:24:36.707 --> 00:24:37.007]  citizens.
[00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:48.566]  Now Obama puts it in high gear, but pays some slick talk lip service to it.
[00:24:48.566 --> 00:24:54.548]  And so the left in this country embraces pure wickedness, hook, line, and sinker.
[00:24:54.548 --> 00:25:04.752]  And I hear disgusting fake conservatives all over radio and TV defending Obama on one level, and they have another group of them criticizing him, putting out disinfo.
[00:25:04.752 --> 00:25:08.934]  Obama's gonna put Al-Qaeda murderers on the streets of America!
[00:25:09.795 --> 00:25:11.876]  And see, that then gives him left cover.
[00:25:11.876 --> 00:25:13.956]  Oh look, the right wing is attacking him.
[00:25:13.956 --> 00:25:18.418]  Dick Cheney, who has a 9% approval rating, is attacking him.
[00:25:18.418 --> 00:25:21.498]  That will then give Obama incredible support.
[00:25:21.498 --> 00:25:30.121]  You have a horrible, unpopular person, who the media says is the leader of the Republican Party, Dick Cheney,
[00:25:33.493 --> 00:25:37.076]  And we have White House memos saying, run on Dick Cheney, run on Rush Limbaugh.
[00:25:37.076 --> 00:25:40.378]  Both very unpopular with the average American, even most conservatives.
[00:25:40.378 --> 00:25:43.681]  They're discredited.
[00:25:43.681 --> 00:25:45.843]  They're known as hypocrites.
[00:25:45.843 --> 00:25:48.485]  Liars.
[00:25:48.485 --> 00:25:50.346]  Cheney's got a 9% approval rating.
[00:25:50.346 --> 00:25:51.627]  So we've got the White House memos.
[00:25:51.627 --> 00:25:53.829]  You know, this is not just my opinion during the election.
[00:25:53.829 --> 00:25:56.871]  Later it came out, what, a month ago, that it's White House memos.
[00:25:56.871 --> 00:25:57.592]  New York Times.
[00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:00.666]  Washington Post!
[00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:04.389]  They want to run on Cheney and run on Limbaugh.
[00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:12.534]  Instead of a new idea of liberty and freedom, they want to hang around the neck of conservatism, tripling the size of government, torture, secret arrest.
[00:26:12.534 --> 00:26:16.096]  But see, Cheney, Obama, they're all just puppets.
[00:26:16.096 --> 00:26:24.201]  Their job is to act like they're really the power structure and to have these staged fights with each other, where Obama says, you did things wrong, Bush and Cheney.
[00:26:24.201 --> 00:26:27.643]  I'm going to continue the indefinite secret detention and all the rest of this.
[00:26:28.868 --> 00:26:42.819]  We're going to do a process and hear from Congress on a wide spectrum of the political landscape, not wide spectrum, the controlled left-right paradigm, and then we're going to see what to do to keep America safe.
[00:26:42.819 --> 00:26:49.404]  And then meanwhile, Cheney comes out and attacks that, so the left then goes, hey, you know, what Obama's doing is good!
[00:26:49.404 --> 00:26:51.226]  Don't you see the mind trick?
[00:26:51.226 --> 00:26:53.568]  You've now accepted secret arrest, secret torture,
[00:26:54.662 --> 00:27:19.250]  Indefinite detention, and Obama's got chief high-level Democrats all over Congress introducing hate crimes bills that restrict free speech, but that's nothing compared to the Cyberbullying Act with Hannah Montana pushing it in character in Reuters and on national TV, and I turned the television on for 30 minutes last night and saw Hannah Montana all over pushing, we've got to pass the Cyberbullying Act that says felony arrest
[00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.612]  If someone says you hurt their feelings, I mean, the end of the First Amendment!
[00:27:23.612 --> 00:27:26.753]  The end of free speech!
[00:27:26.753 --> 00:27:28.814]  They're attacking the Second Amendment!
[00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:32.516]  They're hitting us at every level!
[00:27:32.516 --> 00:27:43.461]  And Obama is in deep political trouble, and his approval rating is dropping, even with his base, because they're finding out he's involved in the banker bailout and the banker takeover, and now they want a new one!
[00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:45.362]  It's reported today.
[00:27:45.362 --> 00:27:47.063]  Even more powers and more trillions!
[00:27:49.318 --> 00:27:53.160]  And so Obama tried to say, hey, I'm closing Guantanamo.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:28:05.625]  And people read the executive order and they said, wait a minute, it says you're going to look at closing it in a year, but moving people to offshore European and Central Asian bases and in Montana and Wyoming and places?
[00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:07.325]  And that citizens will be held at these?
[00:28:07.325 --> 00:28:16.209]  And the facilities they've listed are already facilities, quote, holding, there's a new division of Supermax the feds have that holds like people that break in and free monkeys.
[00:28:16.969 --> 00:28:21.472]  Or people that, whether you agree with that or not, or people that burn down a ski resort.
[00:28:21.472 --> 00:28:29.556]  Pretty bad folks, burning down a ski resort, but they hold them in supermax special anti-terror prisons where they can't talk to lawyers or family.
[00:28:29.556 --> 00:28:32.218]  That's in the news, but in the back of the paper.
[00:28:32.218 --> 00:28:36.921]  They're going to stick US citizens with these people out of Central Asia?
[00:28:36.921 --> 00:28:40.263]  And then the news keeps saying, all these people are guilty!
[00:28:40.263 --> 00:28:41.764]  These are terrorists they're going to let go.
[00:28:42.602 --> 00:28:48.625]  And then they admit that more than two-thirds of the evidence obtained in fake terror alerts was obtained through torture?
[00:28:48.625 --> 00:29:00.231]  I mean, they waterboarded Sheikh Khalid Mohammed for five and a half years, and then he confessed to bombing buildings that weren't even built when he was arrested?
[00:29:00.231 --> 00:29:06.474]  I'm surprised he didn't confess to sinking the Titanic, to crucifying Jesus Christ!
[00:29:06.474 --> 00:29:09.075]  I'm surprised he didn't confess to killing Lincoln!
[00:29:17.176 --> 00:29:21.657]  It is absolutely amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:21.657 --> 00:29:23.178]  And so this is the type of political diversion.
[00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:33.841]  He comes out and says he's getting rid of it, but if you listen to the fine print of what he's saying and the fine print of what he's written, it's the exact same thing, but with a velvet glove on it.
[00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:38.442]  So he's shoring up all the horrible things the new order got done on Bush's watch,
[00:29:39.818 --> 00:29:45.622]  Now he's getting left cover as Cheney attacks him to make it look like he's doing something good.
[00:29:45.622 --> 00:29:49.245]  This is some slick stuff and the public will buy it for a while.
[00:29:49.245 --> 00:29:51.206]  But they'll wake up.
[00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:52.587]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.587 --> 00:29:55.129]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.129 --> 00:29:57.811]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.643 --> 00:30:02.325]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.325 --> 00:30:07.072]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:30:07.072 --> 00:30:10.036]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:30:10.036 --> 00:30:13.080]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.807]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:30:18.027 --> 00:30:19.147]  If you simply prepare.
[00:30:19.147 --> 00:30:22.388]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:30:22.388 --> 00:30:29.389]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:32.650]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:33.570]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.811]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:30:37.811 --> 00:30:44.072]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:30:44.072 --> 00:30:45.393]  Watch the free videos.
[00:30:45.393 --> 00:30:46.573]  Look at their online catalog.
[00:30:46.793 --> 00:30:47.394]  We're good to go.
[00:31:07.473 --> 00:31:13.356]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.356 --> 00:31:19.778]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.778 --> 00:31:21.819]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.819 --> 00:31:24.280]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:35.165]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.469 --> 00:31:39.130]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.992]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.992 --> 00:31:47.897]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.897 --> 00:31:56.164]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:57.745]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.745 --> 00:31:58.926]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.712 --> 00:32:04.217]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:32:04.217 --> 00:32:08.742]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:32:08.742 --> 00:32:16.632]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:32:16.932 --> 00:32:20.054]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:32:20.054 --> 00:32:27.700]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:33.284]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:32:33.504 --> 00:32:39.346]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:32:39.346 --> 00:32:42.887]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:32:42.887 --> 00:32:46.488]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:32:46.488 --> 00:32:51.549]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Sheep superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:54.470]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.650]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:33:00.723 --> 00:33:06.211]  Way up north, to Alaska Way up north, to Alaska North!
[00:33:06.211 --> 00:33:06.772]  To Alaska!
[00:33:06.772 --> 00:33:08.915]  Go north, for us you're so North!
[00:33:20.882 --> 00:33:26.564]  No, no, we've got Dr. Rand Paul joining us here in just a few moments until the end of this hour.
[00:33:26.564 --> 00:33:30.146]  Jesse Ventura is going to be on with us coming up in the last hour today.
[00:33:30.146 --> 00:33:35.608]  We've got a lot of important news and information coming up as well.
[00:33:35.608 --> 00:33:37.789]  Dr. Paul's talking about running for the U.S.
[00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:38.089]  Senate.
[00:33:38.089 --> 00:33:40.750]  We'll also talk about his dad, what the campaign was like.
[00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.911]  I got a chance to meet his brother who's in the Obama deception.
[00:33:44.625 --> 00:33:46.946]  Wayne Paul, Ron Paul's brother.
[00:33:46.946 --> 00:33:51.107]  So I also want to talk about the family and what this has been like for them as well, not just the campaign.
[00:33:51.107 --> 00:33:53.648]  Always interesting to talk to this great family.
[00:33:53.648 --> 00:33:57.409]  Before we go any further, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:59.170]  One of them is Pepperspray.com.
[00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.291]  And when I tell you that Pepperspray.com is the one-stop shop to get your
[00:34:03.971 --> 00:34:06.555]  Non-lethal, self-defense needs.
[00:34:06.555 --> 00:34:07.616]  It is the place.
[00:34:07.616 --> 00:34:11.221]  Best prices, free shipping on orders over $99.
[00:34:11.221 --> 00:34:17.790]  Stun guns, tasers, great to give women and your family or if you're in an area where Second Amendment's restricted, but these aren't.
[00:34:18.872 --> 00:34:20.555]  Very important.
[00:34:20.555 --> 00:34:26.343]  Great stun guns and tasers, pepper spray of all kinds and strengths, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms.
[00:34:26.343 --> 00:34:30.590]  We live in an unpredictable world and as everybody knows, I'm all about preparedness.
[00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.593]  Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[00:34:32.593 --> 00:34:34.055]  That's why I want you to visit
[00:34:34.355 --> 00:34:40.140]  Our new sponsor, Pepperspray.com, and check out their wide variety of personal security products they have available on their website.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:44.284]  Since 1994, Pepperspray.com has made your personal safety their number one priority.
[00:34:44.284 --> 00:34:47.787]  Here is their toll-free number, 1-800-908-9988.
[00:34:47.787 --> 00:34:48.968]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:34:48.968 --> 00:34:52.071]  Home invasions, robberies are exploding everywhere.
[00:34:52.071 --> 00:34:58.776]  I've got a friend who just moved back from Costa Rica down there doing construction work, and most of the Americans they know are leaving.
[00:34:59.505 --> 00:35:02.488]  And Canadians are leaving because they're just, home invasions everywhere.
[00:35:02.488 --> 00:35:03.769]  It's starting up in the US.
[00:35:03.769 --> 00:35:04.750]  Costa Rica used to be real good.
[00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.273]  The point is, in a bad economy, stuff gets worse.
[00:35:07.273 --> 00:35:11.417]  Instead of having to shoot somebody, you can taser them.
[00:35:11.417 --> 00:35:12.318]  Or kill them if you want.
[00:35:12.318 --> 00:35:14.240]  I mean, the point is, this gives you an option.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:14.540]  800-908-9988.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:14.580]  800-908-9988.
[00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:30.161]  Also, I want to encourage everybody to check out all the new books and videos we're carrying, like the Secret Mysteries of America Revealed Part 3, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:33.944]  That's now out and discounted on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:33.944 --> 00:35:35.865]  Get the Obama Deception!
[00:35:35.865 --> 00:35:41.609]  Obamanoids are finally ready to wake up that this guy is a shill, a front man, and they need to see this documentary.
[00:35:41.609 --> 00:35:46.932]  It shows them who he really works for and shatters the left-right paradigm, and it's all about ending the Fed.
[00:35:46.932 --> 00:35:48.994]  It's about solutions taken on the private bankers.
[00:35:49.974 --> 00:35:51.855]  We'll talk about that with Rand Paul in a moment as well.
[00:35:51.855 --> 00:35:53.897]  His dad's gotten a whole bunch of sponsors now.
[00:35:53.897 --> 00:35:54.958]  Things are getting close.
[00:35:54.958 --> 00:35:58.501]  So again, InfoWars.com is a secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[00:35:58.501 --> 00:35:59.442]  Our calls are all free.
[00:35:59.442 --> 00:36:00.763]  Ask about the combos and specials.
[00:36:00.763 --> 00:36:06.487]  You can also call the bookstore, 888-253-3139.
[00:36:06.487 --> 00:36:08.028]  888-253-3139.
[00:36:08.028 --> 00:36:13.733]  You can also see all of my films in super high quality and more, and watch the live TV show every day at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:13.733 --> 00:36:14.934]  I want to thank the members there.
[00:36:15.234 --> 00:36:22.619]  Okay, without further ado, Dr. Rand Paul, joining us from Kentucky, and he's going to be traveling around the country soon.
[00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:28.863]  We're syndicated nationwide and now on XM, so folks everywhere should go to these fundraisers he's going to be having.
[00:36:28.863 --> 00:36:30.904]  Rand Paul, great to have you here, sir.
[00:36:30.904 --> 00:36:31.765]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.971]  Very exciting times.
[00:36:33.971 --> 00:36:37.634]  Before we get into your campaign, are you going to be running for the Senate?
[00:36:37.634 --> 00:36:38.455]  Looks like you are.
[00:36:38.455 --> 00:36:46.661]  But before we do that, your dad, tell us about how he's doing, about the, what is it, 120-something sponsors now to audit the Fed?
[00:36:46.661 --> 00:36:49.103]  I mean, Liberty is on the march.
[00:36:49.103 --> 00:36:59.772]  I think the audit the Fed bill is really, really exciting, and it's a real example of how our movement is not just a protest movement anymore, that we're actually going to get something done in Congress, hopefully.
[00:36:59.772 --> 00:37:00.252]  Actually, over 160
[00:37:02.088 --> 00:37:03.728]  Co-sponsors now.
[00:37:03.728 --> 00:37:07.509]  It's virtually guaranteed that it will get a vote in committee.
[00:37:07.509 --> 00:37:14.111]  They haven't scheduled a committee meeting yet, but Barney Frank is the chairman of the committee and he's agreed to hold hearings.
[00:37:14.111 --> 00:37:20.012]  And what I've heard is that if it passes in committee, there's a very good chance it can pass on the floor.
[00:37:20.012 --> 00:37:25.454]  And this is a good first step towards opening the transparency of what goes on at the Federal Reserve.
[00:37:25.454 --> 00:37:30.455]  What's amazing is they've increased their balance sheet or their asset sheet by $2 trillion.
[00:37:31.431 --> 00:37:36.638]  You know, we talk and complain about the trillion-dollar stimulus and the trillion-dollar bank bailout.
[00:37:36.638 --> 00:37:43.987]  The Federal Reserve increased their asset sheet by $2 trillion, and nobody got to vote on it, and nobody even gets to know where the money's spent.
[00:37:43.987 --> 00:37:46.290]  So it's about time we opened up the books to the Fed.
[00:37:48.112 --> 00:37:49.053]  It certainly is.
[00:37:49.053 --> 00:37:52.638]  You know, a lot of people said, oh, look, Ron Paul lost.
[00:37:52.638 --> 00:37:53.159]  What a waste.
[00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:54.781]  And I said, wait a minute.
[00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:57.124]  You know, revolutions always take time.
[00:37:57.124 --> 00:38:02.631]  The number one new movement on campuses is starting to overshadow the phony liberals and phony conservatives.
[00:38:03.232 --> 00:38:06.333]  is the Libertarian Ron Paul Patriot Movement.
[00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:08.333]  He was just a focal point of that.
[00:38:08.333 --> 00:38:19.976]  All this investment in time and energy is just going to continue to grow and now everybody has seen that and are more heartened than ever and have learned the lesson that this isn't going to be instant gratification.
[00:38:19.976 --> 00:38:21.256]  This is like planting crops.
[00:38:21.256 --> 00:38:25.237]  A lot of work comes into it, but before you know it, you're bringing in that harvest.
[00:38:25.237 --> 00:38:27.398]  It's going to be the same with your Senate campaign, and I pray
[00:38:28.098 --> 00:38:35.283]  Just like we pushed your dad to run for president, I pray that you will, after you're done exploring this, do it.
[00:38:35.283 --> 00:38:41.387]  Because it's so important to just launch more torpedoes at the enemy, and I see you as a very important torpedo.
[00:38:41.387 --> 00:38:48.112]  Not just because of your father's name, but your great education, your patriotic stance, your activities in Kentucky, your history of liberty.
[00:38:48.112 --> 00:38:52.775]  I think you're the man for the job, and you're a weapon we need to use against the New World Order.
[00:38:53.629 --> 00:39:08.115]  Well, the amazing thing about my father's loss, and I was very involved with the campaign, and I heard some of the dissatisfaction from people, but I try to convince people that the amazing thing about the loss is that he is routinely on the mainstream media now.
[00:39:08.115 --> 00:39:16.959]  Our viewpoint, finally, for the first time in probably 30 years, we have a spokesman who may not be listening to him all the time in Washington,
[00:39:17.592 --> 00:39:25.257]  But we have someone who presents our point of view to a large audience on a national basis, and he became a national leader.
[00:39:25.257 --> 00:39:37.985]  And there's something quirky about the media in the sense that you can be a regional person, a congressional candidate, or a congressman, but then when you take that next step up to the national level, all of a sudden everybody wants to know your opinion.
[00:39:37.985 --> 00:39:45.110]  The other thing that's made him very prescient is the fact that he predicted the housing bubble just
[00:39:45.862 --> 00:39:55.252]  Exactly, in 2003, in committee saying there will be this housing bubble, not only will mortgages fail, but banks will fail because of this.
[00:39:55.252 --> 00:39:57.274]  And now that's being repeated verbatim.
[00:39:57.274 --> 00:39:59.036]  Tom Woods put it in his book.
[00:39:59.036 --> 00:40:02.340]  Joe Scarborough's putting it verbatim in a book that he's publishing.
[00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:07.735]  So people are taking notice of the fact that he predicted what was going to happen with this housing bubble.
[00:40:07.735 --> 00:40:08.255]  Exactly.
[00:40:08.255 --> 00:40:10.156]  We have a bandwagon effect.
[00:40:10.156 --> 00:40:21.941]  You have the Republican Party that sold out the new world order totally in shambles and they're recognizing the only thing left and growing is true conservatism, true libertarian viewpoint.
[00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:24.522]  And I've got to say this, your father's very scholarly.
[00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:31.565]  He had a lot more fire and was more passionate when he was, you know, 30 years ago giving speeches that have been since put up on YouTube.
[00:40:32.245 --> 00:40:41.547]  And he's very humble, so he didn't like to get aggressive and really show a lot of fire in the belly until he got attacked, and we saw more of that.
[00:40:41.547 --> 00:40:44.227]  And now he's gotten very comfortable on TV.
[00:40:44.227 --> 00:40:46.968]  Now he's on national TV almost every day.
[00:40:46.968 --> 00:40:53.289]  And he is, as you said, we're forcing the American people's popular viewpoint now to the mainstream.
[00:40:53.289 --> 00:40:59.370]  They're having to capitulate and admit that we are a massive minority becoming a majority
[00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:11.788]  And this is an incredible, incredible victory, and that goes to you, your father, to everybody that supported Ron Paul, to people who have fought for liberty for decades in this nation.
[00:41:11.788 --> 00:41:21.336]  We're having huge success, and I want listeners to understand that, that the establishment has tried to send people into our midst to be naysayers and to nitpick and ninny.
[00:41:21.336 --> 00:41:27.321]  Those people, you know, a lot of them are just closed-minded, but a lot of them are operatives.
[00:41:28.146 --> 00:41:31.429]  Right, and you mentioned going beyond sort of the right-left paradigm.
[00:41:31.429 --> 00:41:43.498]  This is what I tell people about if I can win a primary and get into a general election, is that I don't think you have to sell your message out and just become a Democrat when you win the primary to attract Democrats.
[00:41:43.498 --> 00:41:54.166]  I think there's a whole host of independents and people who might even call themselves moderate who think the deficit is drowning us and we have to do something about it, but you know the reason they're not voting Republican?
[00:41:54.682 --> 00:41:58.505]  It's because they don't trust the Republicans anymore to do anything about it.
[00:41:58.505 --> 00:42:01.026]  So we have to bring back some believability.
[00:42:01.026 --> 00:42:15.095]  You know, as I'm going to be running as a Republican, we need to bring back believability to the Republicans and say, we do believe in reducing the deficit and cutting spending and doing the things that we talked about for many years but never did once we got in power.
[00:42:15.095 --> 00:42:17.097]  And it's not just you running.
[00:42:17.097 --> 00:42:18.498]  We need a lot more people to run.
[00:42:18.498 --> 00:42:19.178]  They are running.
[00:42:19.178 --> 00:42:23.121]  People for county commissioner, dog catcher, mayor, sheriff.
[00:42:23.621 --> 00:42:28.623]  Well I think 2010 could be a big year because just historically there's a backlash a lot of times against presidents
[00:42:53.769 --> 00:43:06.620]  The other thing is this president is going so far in the direction of government, direct government ownership of banks, direct government ownership of the auto companies, that there, I think, there will be a backlash and it could be a good year.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:11.844]  People ask me if I did run, win the nomination, what would I say about the Democrat opponents?
[00:43:11.844 --> 00:43:17.189]  I really think they're going to have to defend Obama and it can be a campaign about President Obama in 2010.
[00:43:17.189 --> 00:43:21.072]  And while he does have high popularity roles,
[00:43:21.508 --> 00:43:30.532]  In Kentucky, he lost overwhelmingly to John McCain, and John McCain ran sort of a lackluster campaign, but he still wiped out President Obama in Kentucky.
[00:43:30.532 --> 00:43:42.296]  So Kentucky is rife, I think, for talking about the fact that we can't go along this road, we cannot continue to sustain this massive deficit.
[00:43:42.296 --> 00:43:43.477]  90% chance you're going to run?
[00:43:43.477 --> 00:43:48.619]  I mean, what do you need to see in your exploratory committee to ensure that you do run?
[00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.751]  There's a couple of things going on.
[00:43:50.751 --> 00:43:52.533]  It's kind of a tricky situation.
[00:43:52.533 --> 00:43:59.479]  We have an incumbent senator, Jim Bunning, who actually did vote against the bank bailout and has been fairly conservative.
[00:43:59.479 --> 00:44:06.044]  He, unfortunately, did vote for some other things that we have a great disagreement with, such as the Patriot Act.
[00:44:06.044 --> 00:44:08.646]  But he, in general, was kind of conservative.
[00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:10.187]  He says he's running.
[00:44:10.187 --> 00:44:13.850]  But at the same time, he says if he doesn't raise enough money, he won't run.
[00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:18.074]  He also has encouraged another candidate other than myself to form an exploratory committee.
[00:44:18.703 --> 00:44:27.365]  Which doesn't seem to make sense, because if he's really running, why would he encourage other people to compete with him for fundraising if that's the key criteria for him to keep running?
[00:44:27.365 --> 00:44:35.346]  Well, I don't care if he's got a half good... I mean, Dr. Paul, to interrupt here, I don't care if he's got a few good things on his record, a bunch of it's bad.
[00:44:35.346 --> 00:44:37.026]  Your dad isn't going to live forever.
[00:44:37.026 --> 00:44:46.008]  We need to use the Paul name for liberty, and we need you to go ahead and get into politics and go ahead and start winning to follow in your father's footsteps.
[00:44:46.983 --> 00:44:52.104]  I think that's sort of the question, and some of it will be shown by what we can raise through the Exploratory Committee.
[00:44:52.104 --> 00:44:55.785]  I was telling you earlier, we plan on going to several different states.
[00:44:55.785 --> 00:45:03.487]  I'm working on coming to Texas in August, and we're hoping to actually get down to your neck of woods to Austin, and we know we have a lot of friends in the Austin area.
[00:45:03.487 --> 00:45:11.189]  The Austin area is one of the biggest meet-up groups in the country, and we hope that the people of Texas will try to get us a new U.S.
[00:45:11.189 --> 00:45:12.129]  Senator in Kentucky.
[00:45:13.257 --> 00:45:18.920]  The power of having a Paul in the House and a Paul in the Senate.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:26.584]  And for folks who want to know your policies, your ideas, I've read your writings, I know your history with the Kentucky Taxpayers Association and what you've done.
[00:45:26.584 --> 00:45:30.946]  You're basically what I would call a chip off the old block.
[00:45:30.946 --> 00:45:33.748]  Your policies are basically identical to your father, correct?
[00:45:33.748 --> 00:45:35.429]  I'd say we'd be very, very similar.
[00:45:35.429 --> 00:45:37.590]  We might present the message sometimes differently.
[00:45:38.103 --> 00:45:49.832]  You know, we have a website if people want to learn more about what I think, RandPaul2010.com and on that website we already have a lot of policy issues and a lot of them are very, very similar to my father.
[00:45:49.832 --> 00:46:01.281]  I will be my own person and I think the message in some ways has to be broadened and made more appealing to the entire Republican electorate because you have to win a primary.
[00:46:01.281 --> 00:46:05.565]  Not only that, it's as I do believe in a slightly different presentation,
[00:46:06.024 --> 00:46:12.207]  For example, on national defense, my father and I agree completely that you should declare war.
[00:46:12.207 --> 00:46:16.089]  You know, you should not fight war without declaring it constitutionally.
[00:46:16.089 --> 00:46:25.434]  But at the same time, I think it's important that we emphasize that the Constitution, one of the primary enumerated powers of the Constitution, was national defense.
[00:46:25.434 --> 00:46:28.156]  And so we do believe in a strong national defense.
[00:46:28.156 --> 00:46:31.757]  We just have to define what is in our best national defense.
[00:46:31.757 --> 00:46:32.758]  But once we do so,
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:41.908]  We need to appear and acknowledge that we do believe in a military response to those who attack us.
[00:46:41.908 --> 00:46:44.711]  Sure, I mean that's just a popular thing.
[00:46:44.711 --> 00:46:51.036]  But obviously you would try to repeal the Patriot Act, you'd try to repeal unconstitutional gun laws, you'd try to defend the borders?
[00:46:51.036 --> 00:46:58.043]  Yeah, and in fact one of the things that I spoke recently at the Knob Creek machine gun shootout in Kentucky, a pretty amazing thing,
[00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:06.335]  Over 3,000 people show up at this machine gun shootout, and I gave a speech there, and I said, look, I'm a great defender of the Second Amendment, but you know what?
[00:47:06.335 --> 00:47:10.118]  If you want the Second Amendment, you've got to defend the First Amendment also.
[00:47:10.118 --> 00:47:16.282]  McCain-Feingold limits what Second Amendment groups can do, limits my taxpayer group from buying advertising.
[00:47:16.282 --> 00:47:22.006]  It's actually illegal for me to buy advertising within 60 days of the election under McCain-Feingold.
[00:47:22.006 --> 00:47:25.969]  So I tell them, if you want the Second Amendment, you want to defend the Second, you've got to defend the First.
[00:47:26.434 --> 00:47:35.041]  And I said if you want the Second Amendment, you want to be free from government intrusion and looking and snooping about what guns you have in your house, you've got to believe in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:47:35.041 --> 00:47:44.669]  So you can't have the Patriot Act, which eviscerated the Fourth Amendment, if you really want to be free in your home to be allowed to own guns for personal protection.
[00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:47.050]  Now give that website out again for folks.
[00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.333]  It's RandPaul2010.com.
[00:47:50.333 --> 00:47:52.935]  And can folks go ahead and go to RandPaul2010.com and donate?
[00:47:54.281 --> 00:47:54.821]  They can.
[00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:55.742]  We have a donation.
[00:47:55.742 --> 00:47:59.345]  We have a ticker on the site, actually, and I was joking.
[00:47:59.345 --> 00:48:10.232]  I tell people we've got two really old political hacks out in California, age 24 and 25, evidence of the youth movement, who have done this website for me and have done a great job.
[00:48:10.232 --> 00:48:11.493]  Yeah, it's gorgeous.
[00:48:11.493 --> 00:48:14.635]  So, ranpaul2010.com.
[00:48:14.635 --> 00:48:20.900]  I got a lot of questions for you in the ten minutes or so we have left with you, Dr. Ran Paul, son of Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:48:22.631 --> 00:48:26.954]  We have bills introduced in Congress that are just really off the chart.
[00:48:26.954 --> 00:48:32.357]  We have the bill to put everybody on a no-fly list, 1,100,000 Americans in this Kafkaesque system.
[00:48:32.357 --> 00:48:35.580]  No judge, no jury, no face your accuser, no more Second Amendment.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.321]  That's racing through the House.
[00:48:37.321 --> 00:48:42.604]  We have the Cyber Bullying Act being pushed by the character Hannah Montana.
[00:48:42.604 --> 00:48:49.169]  If someone signs an affidavit saying something hurt their feelings, federal felony charges, and that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:54.772]  There's no doubt Obama is making a tyrannical move that I have to say dwarfs Bush.
[00:48:54.772 --> 00:48:57.034]  I didn't think that was possible.
[00:48:57.034 --> 00:48:59.716]  What should we do about that from your view?
[00:48:59.716 --> 00:49:05.079]  I think we have to, you know, work at sunsetting the Patriot Act or repealing the entire thing outright.
[00:49:05.079 --> 00:49:17.608]  I think one of the great ironies, and I actually kind of laughed to see what Jane Harman got caught up in, here's a woman who went along with Bush on supporting all these wireless tapping, and then she gets caught up with her phone tapped.
[00:49:17.932 --> 00:49:36.648]  But it's not a laughing matter for the rest of us, because my wife and I were sitting this morning and we're getting these random emails and we don't know if it's just spam or not, but some of them are in either Arabic or Hebrew, we're not sure what language, but we were kind of laughing and saying, well, you know what, someone's probably sending us email, now we'll get on a list and now they can look at our email.
[00:49:36.648 --> 00:49:44.015]  We laugh, but that could actually be true, that someone sends you a random email that's from another country with another language we don't even understand,
[00:49:44.437 --> 00:49:48.123]  But now they say, well look, you're getting it from this person who's on a watch list.
[00:49:48.123 --> 00:49:51.448]  We're allowed to look at all of Rand Paul's email.
[00:49:51.448 --> 00:49:54.953]  And I don't know if that happens, but I know under the Patriot Act, they can do that.
[00:49:54.953 --> 00:49:57.918]  No, no, that's exactly what they do, but they don't even do that anymore.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:06.022]  I mean, they'll get whole terrorism investigations by just going up to somebody at a restaurant or bar and saying, think we might have to have a shooting war someday?
[00:50:06.022 --> 00:50:07.622]  Yeah, Bob, you do!
[00:50:07.622 --> 00:50:13.383]  Boom, they'll open a whole Spence account for, you know, 10 or 15 feds to follow you around for two or three years.
[00:50:13.383 --> 00:50:14.284]  That's how they operate.
[00:50:14.284 --> 00:50:16.044]  So your instincts are right, Doctor.
[00:50:16.044 --> 00:50:18.645]  Well, it's amazing, and it's not brand new either.
[00:50:18.645 --> 00:50:27.787]  If you look back at the history during World War I of what they did through the Sedition and Espionage Act, there's a famous course case, and I think Napolitano writes about this in his book,
[00:50:28.374 --> 00:50:41.559]  It was a farmer out in Montana and he goes down to the feed store with two or three of his buddies and he says, well, I think this war is about a bunch of bankers getting rich in New York and I just died, I don't care much about those Germans.
[00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:44.080]  Says it's a World War II, they put him in jail.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.701]  The first judge that hears the case under the Espionage Act says, well,
[00:50:48.243 --> 00:50:57.728]  Maybe we ought to use a little common sense here, and if it looks like he's going to be able to affect the outcome of the war by going down to the feed store and being against World War I, maybe that's a different story.
[00:50:57.728 --> 00:50:58.468]  Stay there, Doctor.
[00:50:58.468 --> 00:50:59.709]  Final segment with Rand Paul.
[00:50:59.709 --> 00:51:00.950]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:03.411]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[00:51:03.411 --> 00:51:05.332]  Is it safe, secure, and healthy?
[00:51:05.332 --> 00:51:09.794]  Did you know most of our food is not contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[00:51:09.794 --> 00:51:13.977]  We at Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years.
[00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:18.793]  And carry over 1,200 varieties of GMO-free heirloom seed.

[00:51:22.615 --> 00:51:24.697]  That's rareseeds.com.
[00:51:24.697 --> 00:51:29.760]  Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company was started in 1998 by a 17-year-old as a hobby.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.382]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[00:51:33.382 --> 00:51:40.167]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds, strive every year to bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.
[00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:43.609]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe.
[00:51:44.298 --> 00:51:48.845]  Every year at Baker Creek, we work to preserve the best of the oldest for future gardeners.
[00:51:48.845 --> 00:51:52.510]  We also offer affordable seed collections for long-term storage.
[00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:57.938]  Go to www.rareseeds.com and get your seeds from America's pure seed source.

[00:52:00.387 --> 00:52:01.909]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:01.909 --> 00:52:07.295]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.

[00:52:52.812 --> 00:52:53.272]  The Bailout Group.
[00:53:00.325 --> 00:53:03.728]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:53:03.728 --> 00:53:08.172]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:53:08.172 --> 00:53:10.694]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:53:10.694 --> 00:53:16.960]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:23.325]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[00:53:24.506 --> 00:53:26.768]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[00:53:26.768 --> 00:53:34.136]  Introducing Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 superfruits, sea vegetables, and antioxidants.
[00:53:34.136 --> 00:53:36.318]  You know, you work hard for your money.
[00:53:36.318 --> 00:53:38.880]  Isn't it time to start getting what you pay for?
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.541]  Order today!
[00:53:39.701 --> 00:53:39.961]  1-800-210-1922.
[00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:46.766]  With Choose for Health, your body gets to keep the nutrients you swallow.
[00:53:46.766 --> 00:53:53.231]  The first 300 callers are going to receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced Diet.
[00:53:53.231 --> 00:53:53.311]  1-800-210-1922.
[00:53:53.311 --> 00:53:54.212]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[00:54:06.067 --> 00:54:09.829]  Yeah, the statistics are out there.
[00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:13.230]  We got it posted up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:22.114]  The government admits that 90% or more of the people picked up at Guantanamo Bay and other camps in Europe were picked up by rival clans.
[00:54:22.114 --> 00:54:28.076]  And I had this former CIA section chief over in Afghanistan on, he wrote the book Jawbreaker, and he admitted that they'd pay him $24,000 to $25,000
[00:54:31.018 --> 00:54:31.278]  This is
[00:54:49.127 --> 00:54:53.268]  There's at least one prisoner down there that I've read about who was a former governor of a province in Afghanistan.
[00:54:53.268 --> 00:54:55.629]  He was a supporter of Karzai and a supporter of the U.S.
[00:54:55.629 --> 00:54:56.449]  government by all appearances.
[00:55:18.851 --> 00:55:25.953]  But then a rival clan who wanted to take over the governorship turned him in and said he was collaborating with the Taliban.
[00:55:25.953 --> 00:55:32.115]  But it's kind of unclear whether these people are guilty, not guilty, whether a rival clan wants to take their turf.
[00:55:32.115 --> 00:55:38.396]  And like we talked about, 90% of these people in Guantanamo were not picked up directly by the U.S.
[00:55:38.396 --> 00:55:43.758]  troops or picked up by other local troops who then professed that these people are related.
[00:55:43.758 --> 00:55:48.299]  But the hard part of this is that inevitably some of these people are fighters.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.523]  Some of them do go back to the battlefield and fight us.
[00:55:51.523 --> 00:55:54.926]  So really, can we release them in our country?
[00:55:54.926 --> 00:55:57.808]  I'm not sure if they all can be tried properly either.
[00:55:57.808 --> 00:56:03.413]  So really, I think deportation or sending them back to their country of origin might be the best way to go.
[00:56:03.413 --> 00:56:09.058]  And none of it's fair because some have been held for years and years without trial.
[00:56:09.058 --> 00:56:13.322]  If they truly are people who were involved with attacking the U.S.,
[00:56:13.917 --> 00:56:17.380]  I think maybe then they should get life sentences and some should stay in prison.
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.981]  But they deserve a trial.
[00:56:18.981 --> 00:56:19.481]  Exactly.
[00:56:19.481 --> 00:56:20.122]  They deserve a trial.
[00:56:20.122 --> 00:56:22.463]  Because if they don't get a trial, we're not going to get a trial.
[00:56:22.463 --> 00:56:27.927]  We know, Dr. Paul, they're using the Patriot Act against non-terror-related cases.
[00:56:27.927 --> 00:56:29.068]  They've set the precedent.
[00:56:29.068 --> 00:56:32.250]  All of this is going to come back on us.
[00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:32.791]  Right.
[00:56:32.791 --> 00:56:33.471]  I agree with you.
[00:56:33.471 --> 00:56:38.455]  And then ultimately, though, if you cannot figure out how to have a trial and cannot have enough evidence to do this,
[00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:43.103]  I think deportation is the only acceptable way.
[00:56:43.103 --> 00:56:45.683]  I think you deport them to where they were captured.
[00:56:45.683 --> 00:56:48.164]  Now they say, oh, these countries won't take them back.
[00:56:48.164 --> 00:56:54.365]  Well, I think we have enough military force in Afghanistan that they can be taken back to Afghanistan at the very least.
[00:56:54.365 --> 00:56:57.086]  And I think that would be acceptable for the vast majority of people.
[00:56:57.086 --> 00:57:00.186]  It gets rid of the idea of having to try them.
[00:57:00.186 --> 00:57:03.327]  And then, you know, a lot of us aren't going to be too happy if, you know, you take
[00:57:03.976 --> 00:57:09.582]  People who are potentially violent, and we don't know this, but are potentially violent, just put them on the streets of Austin.
[00:57:09.582 --> 00:57:13.126]  You know, I think sending them back to where we captured them is probably the best thing.
[00:57:13.126 --> 00:57:15.990]  The media just does that to demonize releasing any of them.
[00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:17.651]  Final question, Dr. Rand Paul.
[00:57:19.833 --> 00:57:23.215]  We have the DHS report that we broke and the MIAC report that we broke.
[00:57:23.215 --> 00:57:25.416]  When Ron Paul first got it, I didn't believe it.
[00:57:25.416 --> 00:57:27.117]  We don't make stuff up, but I don't blame him.
[00:57:27.117 --> 00:57:29.158]  I mean, it's pretty crazy.
[00:57:29.158 --> 00:57:39.703]  But the point is, saying that veterans, gun owners, conservatives, Ron Paul supporters are basically terrorists, another example of how this war on terror is being used against the American people.
[00:57:39.703 --> 00:57:44.445]  I think the great irony of this, and it would be funny if it weren't so sad, is that
[00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:50.812]  One of the criteria for being on the list could be if you're an adamant defender of the Constitution.
[00:57:50.812 --> 00:58:06.158]  So defenders of the Constitution, those who talk about the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, those people, or even people who are ex-military veterans who have served their country and come home, these are the people we have to worry about and put on a special list.
[00:58:06.158 --> 00:58:11.080]  I think it's really, really horrifying and there should be just universal outrage and
[00:58:11.519 --> 00:58:20.941]  You know, to tell you the truth, once it became public, I was unsure what would happen, but the amazing thing is the more y'all talked about it, the more they did get worried that they were targeting regular U.S.
[00:58:20.941 --> 00:58:27.163]  citizens, and at least officially pulled that off their websites because of things that y'all talked about.
[00:58:27.163 --> 00:58:29.764]  Dr. Rand Paul, let me say bye to you during this break.
[00:58:29.764 --> 00:58:38.966]  It may even hold you over a minute or two, because I want to give out that website again, and I want to give out a number for folks that may not have computers.

[00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:59.615]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:58:59.615 --> 00:59:04.457]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[00:59:04.457 --> 00:59:09.640]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:00:17.289 --> 01:00:22.633]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.633 --> 01:00:26.096]  Yeah, I called Jesse Ventura at home today.
[01:00:26.096 --> 01:00:27.877]  How weird is it that me and him are good friends?
[01:00:27.877 --> 01:00:30.279]  We had a long, good talk on the phone.
[01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:32.631]  It's so interesting.
[01:00:32.631 --> 01:00:33.793]  He's going to be on at the end of the show today.
[01:00:33.793 --> 01:00:35.355]  He's going to do a full hour coming up.
[01:00:35.355 --> 01:00:38.579]  Not this Monday, but next Monday, because I called him on short notice.
[01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:39.580]  He's going to do 30 minutes today.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.604]  That's coming up with a lot of breaking info.
[01:00:42.604 --> 01:00:43.966]  We've got Dr. Rand Paul.
[01:00:43.966 --> 01:00:45.368]  RandPaul2010.com is the exploratory committee.
[01:00:48.462 --> 01:00:49.723]  So be sure and check that out.
[01:00:49.723 --> 01:00:59.931]  I wanted to give out a phone number, but his office isn't big enough yet to be able to take that, so we'll give you a mailing address for our 20-30% of the audience that doesn't have computers and wants to be able to write to him or send a donation.
[01:00:59.931 --> 01:01:04.975]  But I wanted to finish up in a few minutes we have right now, sir, talking about this DHS report.
[01:01:04.975 --> 01:01:10.940]  I know people had trouble believing, and I did too, and then I called the FBI numbers on it, and they said, yeah, that's ours.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.500]  Where'd you get it?
[01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:19.391]  And the MIAC report we got from two separate state police officers, and I called the number and they said, yeah, where'd you get it?
[01:01:19.391 --> 01:01:24.558]  But the moral is, we fought back and now they're having congressional hearings.
[01:01:24.558 --> 01:01:27.823]  The guy in the state police that issued it with the feds in Missouri had to step down.
[01:01:28.724 --> 01:01:35.226]  They're having to apologize because they have to tell these lies about Ron Paul supporters basically being terrorists in the dark.
[01:01:35.226 --> 01:01:46.210]  I think it was a wake-up call to America that this whole Homeland Security thing is about the government suppressing the will of the people and bringing in tyranny that they've been using this threat of terrorism as a pretext.
[01:01:47.523 --> 01:01:51.085]  We have the other interesting thing, and I'm not sure if anybody's found this in any other states.
[01:01:51.085 --> 01:01:53.147]  Have we found any other states that are doing this?
[01:01:53.147 --> 01:01:57.350]  Did Missouri think of this all by themselves, or did this come from DHS in Washington?
[01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:03.214]  No, no, this was written by DHS, and this is in North Carolina, Virginia, Texas.
[01:02:03.214 --> 01:02:06.176]  We basically have these from every state.
[01:02:06.176 --> 01:02:09.318]  And they all had sort of the same thing that they were doing in Missouri?
[01:02:09.318 --> 01:02:13.540]  Well, see, I've been breaking these, and others have, for 13, 14 years.
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:15.742]  This one just got attention for some reason.
[01:02:15.742 --> 01:02:17.123]  Yes, it's all basically the same.
[01:02:18.462 --> 01:02:23.046]  Yeah, it's kind of scary when we're profiling our own citizens.
[01:02:23.046 --> 01:02:25.648]  Well, here's what I wanted to tell you while we had you.
[01:02:25.648 --> 01:02:34.135]  Wayne Paul, your uncle was up at the In The Fed thing with us in Dallas while your father was down in Houston, and we got the Secret Army report and called and they confirmed it.
[01:02:34.135 --> 01:02:39.799]  Did you know Army Intelligence was spying on your dad and your uncle and me in Texas?
[01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:41.500]  And that document, you can just Google,
[01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:49.611]  No, and it really is kind of a sad state of affairs that you can't gather publicly and in peace and protest against the policies of your government without fear of people spying on you.
[01:03:11.411 --> 01:03:15.093]  Well, it shows me the private Federal Reserve's in the wrong, and they're scared of us.
[01:03:15.093 --> 01:03:17.415]  They're scared of our liberty movement.
[01:03:17.415 --> 01:03:25.480]  Well, I think one of the things you could see in the eyes of Bernanke the last time my father grilled him in committee was that there's a difference in tone.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:35.966]  He's always been polite and deferential to my father, but you know, with that last grilling, he's starting to think something might happen, that we might actually take some power away from the Federal Reserve.
[01:03:35.966 --> 01:03:40.909]  So I think they're being even more deferential in their treatment of him because
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:46.562]  They really think he now might have the votes to cut off their unlimited power.
[01:03:46.562 --> 01:03:53.565]  And your father, last time he was on two weeks ago, said that he believes that he may be in danger as he continues.
[01:03:53.565 --> 01:03:54.965]  These people don't play games.
[01:03:54.965 --> 01:04:05.209]  Your father has a lot of courage, and he needs our support and prayers, and we commend you, Dr. Rand Paul, for your fine work as well, and need you to follow in his footsteps, so please run for Senate.
[01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:08.230]  Give us the mailing address for folks that want to support that way.
[01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:22.355]  If you want to mail something to me at 1332 Andrea Street, A-N-D-R-E-A, Bowling Green, Kentucky, 42104, and it's Rand Paul for U.S.
[01:04:22.355 --> 01:04:24.516]  Senate Exploratory Committee.
[01:04:24.516 --> 01:04:26.397]  Give it out again, please.

[01:04:45.327 --> 01:04:47.809]  We're firmly behind you and beside you.
[01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:49.810]  Go with God, Dr. Rand Paul.
[01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:51.151]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:04:51.151 --> 01:04:51.251]  Bye.
[01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:52.272]  All right, there he goes.
[01:04:52.272 --> 01:04:53.252]  Take care.
[01:04:53.252 --> 01:04:58.076]  We shall continue on the other side with all the financial news, your phone calls, and a lot more.

[01:06:01.619 --> 01:06:04.180]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:06:04.804 --> 01:06:07.646]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.646 --> 01:06:13.529]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:06:13.529 --> 01:06:19.952]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:19.952 --> 01:06:21.993]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:21.993 --> 01:06:24.455]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:06:24.455 --> 01:06:34.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[01:06:34.679 --> 01:06:37.640]  That's fascism.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.300]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.160]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:48.082]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:06:56.343 --> 01:06:57.904]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.904 --> 01:07:01.404]  The people strike back.
[01:07:01.404 --> 01:07:02.065]  Hello.

[01:07:06.283 --> 01:07:10.444]  But we have found some more people that we don't want to have our food.

[01:08:00.808 --> 01:08:06.213]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.213 --> 01:08:08.374]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:39.362 --> 01:08:42.363]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:08:42.363 --> 01:08:45.944]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:08:45.944 --> 01:08:50.105]  Former Governor Jesse Ventura is scheduled to be on the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[01:08:50.105 --> 01:08:51.826]  He's something else.
[01:08:51.826 --> 01:08:53.546]  I go, when's good for you to come on?
[01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.166]  He goes, how about next Monday?
[01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:58.087]  And I go, well, that's when I've got an hour.
[01:08:58.087 --> 01:09:00.368]  And I said, well, why don't you, yeah, that's a holiday.
[01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:00.928]  He goes, oh, yeah.
[01:09:01.869 --> 01:09:02.730]  You want to do it then still?"
[01:09:02.730 --> 01:09:05.132]  And I said, no, I may be on the air, I may not.
[01:09:05.132 --> 01:09:05.632]  I'm not sure.
[01:09:05.632 --> 01:09:07.173]  I'm trying to spend more time with my family.
[01:09:07.173 --> 01:09:08.794]  Good idea.
[01:09:08.794 --> 01:09:10.676]  The Monday next.
[01:09:10.676 --> 01:09:13.238]  And I said, okay.
[01:09:13.238 --> 01:09:15.760]  And he goes, how about then and we'll do 30 minutes today.
[01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:20.010]  Then he started telling me about a bunch of stuff.
[01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:23.611]  He is something else, man.
[01:09:23.611 --> 01:09:24.852]  It's so bizarre.
[01:09:24.852 --> 01:09:26.192]  Because he's so nice.
[01:09:26.192 --> 01:09:27.813]  He's like, hey, I'm coming back through there.
[01:09:27.813 --> 01:09:30.814]  I'll come see you in Austin on my way to Mexico.
[01:09:30.814 --> 01:09:33.175]  He's just a regular guy.
[01:09:33.175 --> 01:09:34.595]  Jesse Ventura.
[01:09:34.595 --> 01:09:43.458]  So he is, he's scheduled to come up at the end of the show.
[01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:44.859]  Okay, that said,
[01:09:46.468 --> 01:09:47.569]  I've got all this news.
[01:09:47.569 --> 01:09:53.693]  I have giant stacks of news here in front of me.
[01:09:53.693 --> 01:10:02.680]  And I want to tell you what happened with the little girl whose mother works in this office today and all your great phone calls and I want to commend you for that.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.022]  I've got just a ton of news here about what's happening in the economy.
[01:10:06.022 --> 01:10:12.787]  Massive layoffs, massive job losses, massive consumer spending down, massive plunging in real estate.
[01:10:14.764 --> 01:10:23.107]  Venezuela, Brazil, Russia, Arab nations are all completely starting to dump the dollar.
[01:10:23.107 --> 01:10:27.709]  You know, two years ago they started moving away, now they're rushing for the exits.
[01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:35.032]  You know, as much as I hate the globalists and they use the dollar for their power, I hope the dollar doesn't plunge because, folks, that's all we got left.
[01:10:35.032 --> 01:10:40.314]  Our industry's gone, the government's taxing us at every level, all we've got is fiat currency for the economy.
[01:10:41.554 --> 01:10:45.196]  And I just don't know what to say about this.
[01:10:45.196 --> 01:10:50.678]  Meanwhile, with all this horrible financial news, the government keeps trying to pump the stock market up.
[01:10:50.678 --> 01:10:58.542]  Now remember, in 2006, we had Bilderberg Group Sources, it's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, released in 2007.
[01:10:58.542 --> 01:11:06.766]  Years before all this started.
[01:11:06.766 --> 01:11:06.886]  And...
[01:11:09.721 --> 01:11:12.783]  We break down what's going on in Mildenberg, okay?
[01:11:12.783 --> 01:11:18.025]  Gas prices at $60 a barrel?
[01:11:18.025 --> 01:11:19.326]  They're going to run it up to $150 a barrel.
[01:11:19.326 --> 01:11:27.551]  And then they're going to run the stock market up, the sucker and the stuck, the suckers, to pre-9-11 levels, which they did, then they're going to plunge it.
[01:11:27.551 --> 01:11:37.456]  And they're going to pop the subprime mortgage as the way to begin this, because they want a post-industrial feudal world, they want a feudalist society, they want to bankrupt everybody to be able to get their new world order.
[01:11:38.899 --> 01:11:40.440]  Well, here we are three years later.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.760]  That's exactly what the Globalists announced at Davos.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.301]  It's what they admit they're doing.
[01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:45.621]  It's what they admit they're doing.
[01:11:45.621 --> 01:11:48.182]  Running the fuel up and then plunging it down.
[01:11:48.182 --> 01:11:50.223]  Running the market up and then plunging it down.
[01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:51.964]  And then we got out of Bilderberg last year.
[01:11:51.964 --> 01:11:55.005]  And then again this year, they're going to pump it up one more time.
[01:11:55.005 --> 01:12:00.267]  While the real economy dies, they're going to pump up the stock market to sucker in the soccer moms and the yuppies.
[01:12:00.267 --> 01:12:05.869]  And then they are going to drop the hammer even lower than the $6,000 level the stock market went to a few months ago.
[01:12:07.847 --> 01:12:09.148]  Now, that's what Bilderberg's saying.
[01:12:09.148 --> 01:12:11.449]  You know, they may not have total power and control.
[01:12:11.449 --> 01:12:14.351]  That may not happen.
[01:12:14.351 --> 01:12:18.254]  But Jim Tucker, for 30-plus years, has been infiltrating Bilderberg and has sources inside.
[01:12:18.254 --> 01:12:19.495]  Estalin for 17 years.
[01:12:19.495 --> 01:12:22.137]  And everything they've ever said has come true.
[01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:26.299]  I mean, I forgot our prediction from Bilderberg 2008, when fuel was at $149 a barrel.
[01:12:30.734 --> 01:12:34.757]  We wrote at PrisonPlanet.com, this just got pointed out to us a few weeks ago.
[01:12:34.757 --> 01:12:43.745]  We wrote, because Tucker said, his sources said they were going to drop it by half to bankrupt China, Russia, Venezuela, and the Arabs.
[01:12:43.745 --> 01:12:47.188]  And to bankrupt our economy.
[01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:47.828]  It was at $149 a barrel then.
[01:12:47.828 --> 01:12:49.049]  Months later it was at $55, $60 a barrel.
[01:12:49.049 --> 01:12:50.290]  It's at $60 right now!
[01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:50.410]  From $150!
[01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:51.171]  It's been low as $32!
[01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:05.373]  I mean, you know, Tucker called a year before that Bilderberg was going to bring down the Berlin Wall.
[01:13:05.373 --> 01:13:21.923]  Since then, a decade after he broke that, decade plus, it was in the BBC last week, that, oh, Bilderberg brags, they set up the falling of the Berlin Wall as a controlled mechanism to socialize West Germany.
[01:13:21.923 --> 01:13:23.904]  I mean, everything's been proven accurate.
[01:13:23.904 --> 01:13:25.325]  These people really run things.
[01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:32.494]  Tucker comes on in 2007 from Istanbul and says, okay, here's the deal.
[01:13:32.494 --> 01:13:36.858]  Bush is going to capitulate and say global warming is man-made and we only need a carbon tax.
[01:13:36.858 --> 01:13:38.419]  And then two weeks later, Bush announces it.
[01:13:38.419 --> 01:13:40.201]  People laughed at us when Tucker said that.
[01:13:40.201 --> 01:13:41.502]  Two weeks later, he announces it.
[01:13:41.502 --> 01:13:44.344]  The NFL gets behind it.
[01:13:44.344 --> 01:13:45.966]  NASCAR says it's real.
[01:13:45.966 --> 01:13:47.187]  The airlines say it's real.
[01:13:47.187 --> 01:13:54.073]  The oil companies suddenly say it's real because Bilderberg said, you're going to do this.
[01:13:54.073 --> 01:13:55.454]  So, prediction after prediction.
[01:13:56.519 --> 01:14:12.186]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they're telling you that the economy is going to get fixed when all the real data shows it is devastated, that it is in red-level crisis, that it is falling apart.
[01:14:18.874 --> 01:14:25.299]  And the bankers want to tell you everything's okay until they're busy running up a debt so big we could never pay it off in a trillion years.
[01:14:25.299 --> 01:14:35.787]  I mean, they've stolen $14.8 trillion, according to Bloomberg, two weeks ago in the first seven months of this takeover.
[01:14:35.787 --> 01:14:42.512]  At this rate, in one year, from the banker takeover point, the one-year anniversary, next October 3rd, they would have stolen $26 trillion.
[01:14:47.052 --> 01:14:53.114]  26 trillion would pay off all the mortgages, all the mortgages, not the subprime, all mortgages.
[01:14:53.114 --> 01:15:00.197]  $1,000, you know, pieces of property, up to $10 million pieces of property, everything.
[01:15:00.197 --> 01:15:04.639]  It would do it all.
[01:15:04.639 --> 01:15:06.719]  Everything!
[01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:07.740]  All of it.
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:08.000]  Okay.
[01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:21.949]  And then they're telling you today, in the Wall Street Journal, Fed open to buying more securities.
[01:15:21.949 --> 01:15:30.675]  They're going to buy up all the small banks and hand their assets over to JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs and the Bank of England and the Private Federal Reserve.
[01:15:30.675 --> 01:15:31.276]  The New York Fed.
[01:15:31.276 --> 01:15:34.138]  I mean, that's what they announce here.
[01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:35.478]  Let's go to Jim Newcomer.
[01:15:35.478 --> 01:15:38.961]  He is the Chief Financial Analyst Strategist.
[01:15:40.253 --> 01:15:46.375]  Helps Ted make a lot of his decisions at Midas Resources, a premier precious metals company, and they're patriots.
[01:15:47.495 --> 01:15:54.377]  Ted is in Europe right now trying to secure gold and silver because that's where the major gold and silver supplies are because Europe isn't stupid.
[01:15:54.377 --> 01:15:55.557]  They've been hoarding it.
[01:15:55.557 --> 01:16:00.019]  They made it illegal here to own gold and so it was all shipped to Europe during the 30s under the War Powers Act.
[01:16:00.019 --> 01:16:02.839]  So Ted's over in Europe trying to get better deals on it.
[01:16:02.839 --> 01:16:05.180]  That's how bad things have dried up.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:09.381]  Most people are sold out or they've got giant premiums on limited amounts of coins.
[01:16:09.381 --> 01:16:10.321]  Well guess what Ted has?
[01:16:10.321 --> 01:16:11.622]  He has something no one has.
[01:16:12.984 --> 01:16:16.207]  Ted has gold he bought at the 880 level.
[01:16:16.207 --> 01:16:18.048]  That's what he's selling it into the market at.
[01:16:18.048 --> 01:16:22.072]  When gold is at, let me hit refresh here, on the mercantile.
[01:16:23.768 --> 01:16:26.790]  $9.43 and that was an hour ago.
[01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:29.131]  I just hit refresh.
[01:16:29.131 --> 01:16:30.572]  $9.48 and 80 cents.
[01:16:30.572 --> 01:16:41.198]  So gold is $68 plus up from three weeks ago and Ted is selling you this gold priced in the market at the price $68 an ounce cheaper.
[01:16:41.198 --> 01:16:44.780]  He's got silver about a dollar and a half factored into the market.
[01:16:46.698 --> 01:16:47.599]  For what he got it for.
[01:16:47.599 --> 01:16:49.500]  He bought it at 13-something level.
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.761]  Let's bring Jim Newcomer up.
[01:16:50.761 --> 01:16:53.624]  Jim, we're going to do this quick offer for folks.
[01:16:53.624 --> 01:16:56.887]  You guys happen to have Lakotas that people are selling for $25 apiece.
[01:16:56.887 --> 01:17:00.510]  You factored them in at $9.1966.
[01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:05.074]  You've got the... You've got those U.S.
[01:17:05.074 --> 01:17:07.956]  half dollars at even less than that.
[01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:10.198]  And Ted is saying that this is over.
[01:17:10.198 --> 01:17:12.800]  He will probably be sold out by the weekend.
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.402]  So, what do folks do, Jim Newcomer?
[01:17:14.841 --> 01:17:16.242]  Well, he thinks we're going to be sold out.
[01:17:16.242 --> 01:17:21.265]  We're going to try to run this through the weekend if it's at all possible, but we do have that Lakota National Silver Rounds.
[01:17:21.265 --> 01:17:25.808]  They're at $19.66 or $3.93.20 a roll.
[01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:27.509]  That's the way most people have been buying them.
[01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.190]  And the Franklin Half Dollars.
[01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:32.232]  They're at $173.80 per roll of $20.
[01:17:32.232 --> 01:17:38.175]  Interesting about silver, since the first of the year, silver's actually up 29% since January 2nd.
[01:17:38.175 --> 01:17:43.979]  So, it's really shown great growth this year, and there's an opportunity for it to really explode.
[01:17:44.488 --> 01:17:52.291]  Gold, on the other hand, is up 9% since the first year, but since the first of the month, it's going up steadily, while the other economic indicators have gone down.
[01:17:52.291 --> 01:17:58.733]  Crude oil, for example, today is down today, and we got the gold up, what, $13, $14, somewhere in that neighborhood.
[01:17:58.733 --> 01:18:02.034]  So, it is the time to get out and get the precious metals.
[01:18:02.034 --> 01:18:03.915]  People aren't spending because of the recession.
[01:18:03.915 --> 01:18:07.796]  They're concerned about everything, but in precious metals, they are spending.
[01:18:07.796 --> 01:18:12.758]  They may not be buying automobiles or buying clothing or homes or things like that, but they are moving
[01:18:13.134 --> 01:18:16.616]  From the paper assets into the hard assets of the precious metals.
[01:18:31.963 --> 01:18:32.844]  We're good to go.
[01:18:54.699 --> 01:19:00.020]  It's financial security, and that's the reason these countries are running away from the dollar and into the precious metals.
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.780]  It's going to put a heavy demand on it.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:07.461]  The price of the products can only go up if it's even available, and that's another concern we have.
[01:19:07.461 --> 01:19:12.022]  The availability, as you had mentioned, Ted's over in Europe right now trying to secure some more.
[01:19:12.022 --> 01:19:17.003]  But we ask people call us, and if you have questions about the precious metals, anything at all, call us.
[01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:17.683]  The number here is 800-686-2237.
[01:19:17.683 --> 01:19:18.443]  The brokers are here.
[01:19:22.904 --> 01:19:24.467]  Almost 24 hours a day.
[01:19:24.467 --> 01:19:30.057]  They'll be glad to answer your questions, provide you with any backup information or any information you need.
[01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:30.978]  Don't be afraid to do it.
[01:19:30.978 --> 01:19:36.047]  70% of the people we're talking to now are people that have never invested in precious metals before.
[01:19:36.596 --> 01:19:37.176]  800-686-2237.
[01:19:37.176 --> 01:19:38.117]  800-686-2237.
[01:19:38.117 --> 01:19:43.202]  Jim Newcomer, stay there.
[01:19:43.202 --> 01:19:52.730]  I'm going to do a minute or two on the other side and tell folks the specific silver and gold coins that we're giving this offer on and some of the other stuff you've got there.
[01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:57.033]  Because if you don't tell them it's this special, folks, you will not get this deal.
[01:19:57.033 --> 01:19:58.775]  This is the price it was three weeks ago.
[01:19:58.775 --> 01:20:00.096]  $60 plus dollars under.
[01:20:00.891 --> 01:20:02.573]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:20:02.573 --> 01:20:04.314]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:20:04.314 --> 01:20:06.997]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:20:06.997 --> 01:20:12.142]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:20:12.142 --> 01:20:15.325]  That's why I'd like you to visit acoloblue.com.
[01:20:15.325 --> 01:20:18.848]  Acoloblue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:20:19.221 --> 01:20:31.796]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:20:31.796 --> 01:20:33.798]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:20:33.798 --> 01:20:35.520]  I use one every day.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.983]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:20:38.163 --> 01:20:39.903]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:21:04.534 --> 01:21:07.156]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.156 --> 01:21:14.123]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:21:14.733 --> 01:21:21.257]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:21.257 --> 01:21:23.298]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:23.298 --> 01:21:25.800]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:37.367]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:21:37.367 --> 01:21:39.048]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.048 --> 01:21:40.409]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:47.803]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:47.803 --> 01:21:56.072]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:56.072 --> 01:21:57.653]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.653 --> 01:21:58.835]  The people strike back.
[01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:07.454]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.454 --> 01:22:15.578]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.578 --> 01:22:21.160]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[01:22:21.488 --> 01:22:23.748]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:22:23.748 --> 01:22:28.829]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:34.050]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:38.391]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:38.391 --> 01:22:39.491]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.491 --> 01:22:43.992]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.372]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:51.882]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:22:51.882 --> 01:22:53.666]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.666 --> 01:22:53.886]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.219 --> 01:23:05.600]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:14.162]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[01:23:14.162 --> 01:23:17.743]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:20.963]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[01:23:20.963 --> 01:23:23.464]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[01:23:23.464 --> 01:23:26.444]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.
[01:23:26.444 --> 01:23:29.185]  Visit 2bnatural.com and order today!
[01:23:29.554 --> 01:23:30.154]  We're good to go.
[01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.469]  Call 1-888-417-1375.
[01:23:50.469 --> 01:23:52.530]  That's 1-888-417-1375 to order or request your free catalog.
[01:23:52.530 --> 01:23:54.450]  Yeah, gold right now is up $68 in the last three weeks.
[01:24:12.298 --> 01:24:14.239]  Since Ted got this gold.
[01:24:14.239 --> 01:24:16.820]  Silver's way up too since Ted locked this in.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:21.322]  And I talked to Ted before he left in Europe yesterday.
[01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:24.063]  And he said, yeah, we're running out of this.
[01:24:24.063 --> 01:24:26.244]  It should be all gone by the end of the weekend.
[01:24:26.244 --> 01:24:28.165]  Especially if we tell folks about that.
[01:24:28.165 --> 01:24:29.345]  What are these specific coins?
[01:24:29.345 --> 01:24:32.947]  They're British sovereigns, European francs.
[01:24:32.947 --> 01:24:35.688]  That means they're from Swiss, French, you name it.
[01:24:35.688 --> 01:24:38.049]  Great little coins.
[01:24:38.049 --> 01:24:41.731]  And what other coins do we have at that buy level when he bought at 880, Jim Newcomer?
[01:24:42.091 --> 01:24:45.572]  Okay, we got the British Sovereigns at $2.67, that's a quarter ounce coin.
[01:24:45.572 --> 01:24:48.434]  Then we have the 20 franc coin at $214.
[01:24:48.434 --> 01:24:52.135]  Other gold is the $20 Liberty and the $10 Liberty.
[01:24:52.135 --> 01:24:56.957]  This is a pre-33 gold, private gold for those of you worried about confiscation.
[01:24:56.957 --> 01:25:02.099]  And the two silver items again are the Lakota National Rounds, they're at $3.9320 a roll, or $19.66 apiece.
[01:25:02.099 --> 01:25:03.680]  And the franc and half dollars that are $173.80 per roll.
[01:25:09.995 --> 01:25:16.346]  All excellent buys, all a great opportunity to start securing your financial needs.
[01:25:17.213 --> 01:25:19.033]  Yeah, I mean, those aren't excellent buys.
[01:25:19.033 --> 01:25:29.716]  I mean, everybody, they're fantastic, incredible, insane buys, because, I mean, every other gold company likes to buy when it's low and then sell it, you know, when it's high, at that high price.
[01:25:29.716 --> 01:25:32.937]  Ted bought these with almost no markup for himself.
[01:25:32.937 --> 01:25:34.898]  They were already a great deal three weeks ago.
[01:25:34.898 --> 01:25:37.418]  He's selling it, even though he bought it low.
[01:25:37.418 --> 01:25:39.499]  It's like buying stock low and selling it when it's high.
[01:25:39.499 --> 01:25:46.341]  He bought the stock low, and he's selling it at the low price when it's high to be hyper-competitive, and it's only for this audience, Jim.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:47.681]  That's absolutely right.
[01:25:47.681 --> 01:25:54.870]  He wants the average American to be able to get into precious metals and realize the profits that the wealthy have done for years.
[01:25:55.882 --> 01:25:56.022]  800-686-2237.
[01:25:56.022 --> 01:25:56.342]  800-686-2237.
[01:25:56.342 --> 01:26:04.148]  And what Ted is saying, he can run this through to Sunday?
[01:26:04.148 --> 01:26:07.290]  We're going to try to run it through Sunday, through the weekend, yes sir.
[01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:08.391]  But when it's gone, it's gone.
[01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:09.832]  Folks, Ted can't lose money.
[01:26:09.832 --> 01:26:14.635]  He can't, you know, when this is gone, then pay for it at a higher price and pass it on to you at a huge loss.
[01:26:14.635 --> 01:26:16.917]  Right now, he's just selling it to you with basically no profit.
[01:26:16.917 --> 01:26:16.977]  800-686-2237.
[01:26:16.977 --> 01:26:17.037]  800-686-2237.
[01:26:17.037 --> 01:26:18.198]  Any other loose coins?
[01:26:18.198 --> 01:26:19.018]  Do you have any of the
[01:26:25.723 --> 01:26:27.924]  Maple Leafs, do you have any of the buffaloes?
[01:26:27.924 --> 01:26:39.650]  Well, we have literally, in the Bullion products, we have literally everything available to us, but it's a matter of ordering it from the mints, and it's taking six to eight weeks to get out of the mints, simply because of the demand for it.
[01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:42.931]  They're running full-time to fill the wholesalers' needs.
[01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:49.194]  Now, this is what you've got in your vaults downtown now, are the four coins we just mentioned, the two silver and the two gold.
[01:26:49.194 --> 01:26:49.595]  That's correct.
[01:26:49.595 --> 01:26:52.696]  The Lakotas, we are getting low on those, but we will get those in.
[01:26:52.696 --> 01:26:53.917]  We have an order of those coming in.
[01:26:54.679 --> 01:27:00.661]  Okay, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[01:27:00.661 --> 01:27:10.644]  Take advantage of the francs and the sovereigns bought at the 880 level, now in a market that is $948 and climbing as we speak.
[01:27:10.644 --> 01:27:15.205]  And silver is up as well, 800-686-2237.
[01:27:15.205 --> 01:27:17.326]  Will the brokers be there until midnight?
[01:27:17.326 --> 01:27:20.407]  There should be some here until midnight, so there should be people available.
[01:27:20.407 --> 01:27:20.687]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:21.292 --> 01:27:27.914]  Okay, and Jim, don't forget, you're going to pop in with a report on what's happened in the markets today with Jason Burmas tonight at 9.30.
[01:27:27.914 --> 01:27:29.614]  I'll be there, Alex.
[01:27:29.614 --> 01:27:31.535]  Okay, thank you so much, Jim Newcomer.
[01:27:31.535 --> 01:27:32.475]  Have a great day.
[01:27:32.475 --> 01:27:32.715]  You bet.
[01:27:32.715 --> 01:27:41.537]  There goes Jim Newcomer, Chief Financial Analyst Strategist, helps Ted with the buying of coins, get the best deals there at Midas Resources.
[01:27:43.044 --> 01:27:49.806]  Okay, folks, I just have masses of important news that we're going to be getting to coming up now.
[01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:52.007]  Fed open to buying more securities.
[01:27:52.007 --> 01:27:52.807]  I want to go over that.
[01:27:52.807 --> 01:27:54.948]  Obama seeks to retake terrorism front.
[01:27:54.948 --> 01:27:56.288]  He says, oh yeah, there's terrorists.
[01:27:56.288 --> 01:27:59.429]  We've got to take your rights, but we're just not going to do it quite as bad as Cheney did.
[01:27:59.429 --> 01:28:00.990]  So he's paying a bunch of lip service.
[01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.590]  We'll get into that.
[01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:15.163]  Uh, moonshine to Mexican marijuana, family gets busted, big CNN article about this evil old man growing pot and selling it to people, you know, like he's Al-Qaeda or something, while the government ships in heroin and cocaine and George Washington grew marijuana.
[01:28:15.163 --> 01:28:16.564]  Ridiculous article.
[01:28:16.564 --> 01:28:20.969]  Radio talk show host allegations flood Hays County 9-1-1 system, News 8 Austin.
[01:28:23.584 --> 01:28:25.485]  Has got a report about this.
[01:28:25.485 --> 01:28:27.666]  In fact, I forgot to get you guys that video report.
[01:28:27.666 --> 01:28:28.506]  Will you pull this up?
[01:28:28.506 --> 01:28:30.387]  Top Story News 8 Austin.
[01:28:30.387 --> 01:28:34.968]  Maybe we'll play that when we go live to PrisonPlanet.tv or play the audio parts of it.
[01:28:34.968 --> 01:28:38.089]  Senator praises Inquisition as proof that torture works.
[01:28:38.089 --> 01:28:39.470]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:41.151]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:28:41.151 --> 01:28:45.375]  George W. Bush and his key general in Iraq both call the Iraq War a crusade.
[01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:49.358]  Many other high-level civilian military commanders also believe in fighting a religious war against Islam.
[01:28:49.358 --> 01:28:51.200]  That's what they say to fool Christians.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.863]  Troops are actively being interdoctrinated to fight a religious crusade in the Middle East.
[01:28:54.863 --> 01:28:55.184]  The U.S.
[01:28:55.184 --> 01:28:58.647]  military has been busted again trying to convert Afghans.
[01:28:58.647 --> 01:29:04.191]  And it goes on to say Rumsfeld delivered Iraq War intel reports with predominant biblical messages.
[01:29:04.992 --> 01:29:16.636]  And it goes on to say now this week prominent Senator Lindsey Graham basically defended the Spanish Inquisition saying one of the reasons that these techniques have always been used for about 500 years is they work.
[01:29:16.636 --> 01:29:21.458]  And the Communist Chinese admit they got it from the Inquisition documents than we got it from the Communist Chinese.
[01:29:24.235 --> 01:29:26.477]  Obama is said to consider preemptive detention plans.
[01:29:26.477 --> 01:29:27.637]  See, that's New York Times.
[01:29:27.637 --> 01:29:28.558]  They're going to continue that.
[01:29:28.558 --> 01:29:30.680]  We'll go into that.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.581]  Tennessee speeders could get fingerprinted.
[01:29:32.581 --> 01:29:33.982]  This is going to go in nationwide.
[01:29:33.982 --> 01:29:36.023]  Thumbprinting when you get pulled over.
[01:29:36.023 --> 01:29:38.005]  All part of the new biometric slave grid.
[01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:39.386]  Tagged for dropping sweets.
[01:29:39.386 --> 01:29:41.747]  A mint fell out of a guy's pocket on his motorcycle.
[01:29:41.747 --> 01:29:43.589]  He's on home arrest for that.
[01:29:43.589 --> 01:29:48.112]  Also, there's now a police about what your kids are eating in the schools.
[01:29:48.112 --> 01:29:48.892]  We'll go over all of it.
[01:29:48.892 --> 01:29:49.313]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.485 --> 01:29:54.486]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.486 --> 01:30:01.068]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.068 --> 01:30:09.711]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:30:09.711 --> 01:30:14.552]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[01:30:14.552 --> 01:30:19.734]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:31:01.769 --> 01:31:07.012]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.777 --> 01:31:13.660]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:20.164]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:20.164 --> 01:31:22.145]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:22.145 --> 01:31:24.606]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:24.606 --> 01:31:35.492]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:31:37.777 --> 01:31:39.438]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.438 --> 01:31:41.319]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:41.319 --> 01:31:48.222]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:56.486 --> 01:31:58.047]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:58.047 --> 01:31:59.248]  The people strike back.
[01:32:01.195 --> 01:32:08.318]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:32:08.318 --> 01:32:23.925]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the
[01:32:24.525 --> 01:32:29.888]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:32:29.888 --> 01:32:36.412]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:32:36.412 --> 01:32:40.314]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:32:40.314 --> 01:32:42.995]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:32:42.995 --> 01:32:48.358]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:32:48.678 --> 01:32:51.341]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:51.341 --> 01:32:53.583]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:32:53.583 --> 01:32:56.086]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[01:33:20.612 --> 01:33:30.879]  You know, Jesse Ventura's rants on national television about waterboarding, and now he was waterboarded, have gotten big attention.
[01:33:30.879 --> 01:33:35.582]  And I noticed that of all our interviews with him, we have like five, six hours of when he was down here in Austin with us for a few days.
[01:33:35.582 --> 01:33:37.263]  We never put it on the web for some reason.
[01:33:37.263 --> 01:33:42.966]  So we're going to play that audio coming up from us driving around talking to him and post that on YouTube coming up in the next few hours.
[01:33:42.966 --> 01:33:45.688]  Jesse Ventura is coming up.
[01:33:45.688 --> 01:33:49.431]  I want to take some of your phone calls.
[01:33:50.267 --> 01:33:53.530]  Here on the show today at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:53.630]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:53.630 --> 01:33:54.871]  We'll get you up on the air.
[01:33:54.871 --> 01:33:56.272]  So we are opening the phones up right now.
[01:33:56.272 --> 01:33:56.432]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:56.432 --> 01:34:06.100]  Let me just go ahead and get this out of the way now and then later I may play some of the audio from one of the
[01:34:20.225 --> 01:34:22.468]  Newscast.
[01:34:22.468 --> 01:34:30.937]  It is in the Austin American-Statesman, News 8 Austin, and a bunch of other publications here in Austin, Texas.
[01:34:30.937 --> 01:34:40.067]  The Hays County Sheriff's Department, just south of us, where the city of Buda is located, the suburb of Austin really,
[01:34:41.533 --> 01:34:41.793]  I don't
[01:34:57.759 --> 01:35:02.042]  And interrogate them like the old Soviet Union, your parents spank you, which isn't illegal by the way.
[01:35:02.042 --> 01:35:05.605]  And they say yes, they try to take your kids, and they get federal bounties for it.
[01:35:05.605 --> 01:35:14.452]  And the little girl, whose mother works in this office, said that there were two men in there, she believed both were officers, and three women, but the women weren't always in there.
[01:35:14.452 --> 01:35:19.436]  And that they ordered her to take her clothes off, she said no, they said do it.
[01:35:19.436 --> 01:35:26.381]  And I interrogated her Tuesday night for two hours about this, and we then talked to the CPS, and they said yeah, well we told her to take her pants off, but we didn't make her.
[01:35:27.435 --> 01:35:30.522]  Well now they're in the news trying to deny that they even took her pants off.
[01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:33.829]  How'd they know there was a bruise when she was wearing jeans Tuesday?
[01:35:35.522 --> 01:35:37.504]  Uh, and the newspaper took note.
[01:35:37.504 --> 01:35:38.665]  I talked to the reporter last night.
[01:35:38.665 --> 01:35:43.909]  Yeah, they told me that they took her pants off, but now their pants were never even taken off.
[01:35:43.909 --> 01:35:49.853]  And then the Hays County's whining and crying and saying I messed up their 911 system and said I gave up the 911 number.
[01:35:49.853 --> 01:35:55.537]  There's no way for me to get on national radio and say 911, dial it, call Hays County.
[01:35:55.537 --> 01:35:57.339]  911 is localized in your area.
[01:35:58.325 --> 01:36:02.667]  So I had the TV reporters here from News 8, and I gave them the print-off that I read on air.
[01:36:02.667 --> 01:36:15.212]  I gave a 512 administrative office for the Sheriff's Department, and I gave the City Council Mayor's Direct Line in Buda, totally separate from their 911, and I gave the school administration out.
[01:36:15.212 --> 01:36:16.753]  And that's what we did.
[01:36:16.753 --> 01:36:18.934]  So see, they always try to make themselves the victim.
[01:36:18.934 --> 01:36:20.375]  Oh, you called 911.
[01:36:20.375 --> 01:36:22.796]  You're liars!
[01:36:22.796 --> 01:36:24.236]  And the news didn't believe me.
[01:36:24.236 --> 01:36:25.377]  They kept saying, yeah, you gave 911 out.
[01:36:25.377 --> 01:36:26.938]  And I go, how did I give 911 out?
[01:36:29.028 --> 01:36:31.929]  You can't give the 9-1-1 number out for Hays County.
[01:36:31.929 --> 01:36:33.170]  I live in Travis County.
[01:36:33.170 --> 01:36:36.051]  This is a radio show all over the country and all over the world.
[01:36:36.051 --> 01:36:39.132]  Internet, satellite, shortwave, AM and FM.
[01:36:39.132 --> 01:36:42.993]  But it doesn't matter, the news is reporting I gave their 9-1-1 number out.
[01:36:42.993 --> 01:36:48.075]  It's always about making the victimizers the victim.
[01:36:48.075 --> 01:36:54.318]  And first I had the news calling me saying, you said a two-year-old was strip-searched on your radio show and two-year-olds aren't in school.
[01:36:54.318 --> 01:36:57.339]  And I had to argue with them and say, here's the MP3 media,
[01:36:58.595 --> 01:37:00.896]  Get your act straight.
[01:37:00.896 --> 01:37:02.236]  See, they always do straw men.
[01:37:02.236 --> 01:37:09.878]  And then if you read the Austin American Statesman article that Curt Nemo's got linked up on Infowars.com, it's a pretty fair article.
[01:37:09.878 --> 01:37:11.679]  Under it, the first comments are cops.
[01:37:11.679 --> 01:37:13.939]  They say, we are cops.
[01:37:13.939 --> 01:37:18.381]  And they say, I remember when I was in the academy and Alex said they were putting chips in all our brains.
[01:37:18.381 --> 01:37:20.901]  I never said that, you liar.
[01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:25.923]  You know, why don't you admit up to what government does instead of always lying and then believing your lies are true?
[01:37:27.898 --> 01:37:29.659]  Now I'm not trying to blame all the police here.
[01:37:29.659 --> 01:37:34.701]  The child kidnapping police and the police they use are always these little CAP special units.
[01:37:34.701 --> 01:37:40.024]  We had a bunch of CPS experts on yesterday detailing all of that.
[01:37:40.024 --> 01:37:47.688]  So I just want to challenge everybody out there to be aware of this and understand what's going on.
[01:37:48.689 --> 01:37:56.480]  And I want to thank everybody that did call to let them know, because Haley could go back to the government training camp today, and her mother's a working lady, and they can't put her in private school.
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:57.582]  Private schools do this anyways.
[01:37:57.582 --> 01:37:58.523]  Homeschooling's the only answer.
[01:37:59.884 --> 01:38:14.047]  And, uh, you know, they're not going to snatch her kid for now, and the lawyer I hired, comes highly recommended, the same law firm that my lawyer comes out of, is going to meet with the Child Kidnapping Services today to find out what the true skinny is at his offices.
[01:38:14.047 --> 01:38:18.347]  And remember, she was going to meet him at her house, and I said, don't do that, tell him to come to the gas station nearby.
[01:38:18.347 --> 01:38:20.568]  And when she pulled through, there was a cop car there.
[01:38:20.568 --> 01:38:26.589]  So they were planning to twist her arm, demand things, force their way in her house, find dishes or something in the sink, and your kids are gone!
[01:38:28.319 --> 01:38:31.541]  In fact, here's the local Austin news and we're going to your calls.
[01:38:31.541 --> 01:38:36.645]  The Hays County 911 system got tied up Wednesday afternoon because of a radio talk show host.
[01:38:36.645 --> 01:38:42.829]  On his nationally syndicated show, Austin-based Alex Jones blasted the Hays County Sheriff's Office and Child Protective Services.
[01:38:42.829 --> 01:38:44.710]  News 8's Bob Roebuck explains the drama.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.903]  Big Brother.
[01:38:48.903 --> 01:38:50.687]  Mainstream media.
[01:38:50.687 --> 01:38:52.451]  Government cover-ups.
[01:38:52.451 --> 01:38:54.014]  You want answers?
[01:38:54.014 --> 01:38:55.537]  Well, so does he.
[01:38:55.537 --> 01:38:58.484]  On his Wednesday afternoon broadcast, now streaming online.
[01:38:58.843 --> 01:39:09.053]  Alex Jones claimed a Hays County Sheriff's Deputy, along with Child Protective Services, strip-searched a second grader at Buda Elementary during a child abuse investigation.
[01:39:09.053 --> 01:39:17.481]  I want the people to know that did this, we're not just going to defend this little girl, we're going to come after you for what you did and wait until we cover what you did coming up.
[01:39:17.481 --> 01:39:23.927]  I gave the number of the sheriff, I gave the number of the mayor in Buda, I gave the number of the county commissioner's court judge,
[01:39:24.452 --> 01:39:24.933]  I think so.
[01:39:44.633 --> 01:39:56.077]  Lieutenant Leroy Opiella says the deputy stood outside the room while CPS interviewed the little girl, and he never coerced her to submit to a search.
[01:39:56.077 --> 01:40:03.640]  Nevertheless, thousands of people called the Sheriff's administrative line, which then crippled the 911 system for at least 10 minutes.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:12.383]  The Sheriff's office says part of the problem may have been that some of the operators who answer the 911 system also answer the administrative line.
[01:40:12.807 --> 01:40:18.908]  Could have been so tied up with the influx of calls that they weren't available to answer the emergency calls.
[01:40:18.908 --> 01:40:28.010]  As far as 911 operators know, Hayes County didn't miss legitimate emergency calls, but the ordeal still leaves accusations hanging out there.
[01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:31.971]  All the little girl knows is it was men in there telling her she'd get in trouble.
[01:40:31.971 --> 01:40:33.551]  I wasn't there.
[01:40:33.551 --> 01:40:35.451]  Mr. Jones wasn't there.
[01:40:35.451 --> 01:40:37.092]  I don't believe that happened.
[01:40:37.092 --> 01:40:39.012]  Bob Roebuck, News 8, Hayes County.
[01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:43.310]  Okay, so there you have it.
[01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:52.075]  Now, I've talked to the CPS woman, and I've sat there with her on speakerphone when Janet Sanchez, her mother, has talked to her.
[01:40:52.075 --> 01:40:53.755]  And she's like, well, how do you know there was a bruise?
[01:40:53.755 --> 01:40:55.076]  Well, we saw it.
[01:40:55.076 --> 01:40:56.317]  So you took her pants off.
[01:40:56.317 --> 01:40:57.597]  Well, we didn't make her.
[01:40:57.597 --> 01:40:58.638]  I've heard it!
[01:40:58.638 --> 01:41:04.321]  And so now, because I've got their latest press releases, they're saying that CPS didn't even take her pants off.
[01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:09.705]  I mean, these people are absolutely amazing, and government has been caught lying so much.
[01:41:09.705 --> 01:41:14.910]  Now, I don't know if the sheriff's deputies were in there or not, because I talked to little Haley again last night, and she said, look, I don't know.
[01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:17.612]  There were two different men, one in a yellow shirt, another in a uniform.
[01:41:17.612 --> 01:41:18.333]  They were in and out.
[01:41:18.333 --> 01:41:19.193]  They had laptops.
[01:41:19.193 --> 01:41:20.274]  There were cameras.
[01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:22.456]  This went on for, you know, a long time.
[01:41:22.456 --> 01:41:23.057]  I cried.
[01:41:23.057 --> 01:41:25.939]  I asked them to close the blinds, because there was a window.
[01:41:25.939 --> 01:41:32.465]  And yes, it was the men that told her, you're going to get in trouble if you don't take your pants off.
[01:41:33.677 --> 01:41:38.298]  This is what, it's been all over the news, just Google, in fact, Google this right now, guys.
[01:41:38.298 --> 01:41:41.219]  School strip searches girl.
[01:41:41.219 --> 01:41:42.580]  We've all heard of this hundreds of times.
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:45.441]  There's been Supreme Court cases over it.
[01:41:45.441 --> 01:41:48.141]  And it's just despicable.
[01:41:48.141 --> 01:41:59.225]  This is what happens when your little girl wears shorts to school during the summer, and they see a bruise down, almost all the way down her thigh, almost down by the knee, the size of a nickel.
[01:42:00.959 --> 01:42:03.967]  I mean my kids, I was looking at my kids last night, they got bruises all over their legs.
[01:42:03.967 --> 01:42:08.337]  They run around playing, they wrestle, they're in gymnastics, they're in soccer, they're in swimming.
[01:42:09.110 --> 01:42:12.173]  I mean, I got a stubbed toe, I told the news.
[01:42:12.173 --> 01:42:22.661]  I got a big purple, partly ripped off toenail where I was walking around my parking lot at my house and just stubbed my toe on a flagstone and it was bleeding and it hurt like the dickens.
[01:42:22.661 --> 01:42:25.564]  Will they come arrest my wife and take me for protective services?
[01:42:25.564 --> 01:42:27.305]  They do that to old people now.
[01:42:27.305 --> 01:42:34.831]  Bring your old mom or dad who's 85 years old in to have a broken tooth fixed, they say you knock their tooth out and take them and seize their money.
[01:42:35.552 --> 01:42:36.313]  We're sick of it!
[01:42:36.313 --> 01:42:37.235]  We all know what you do.
[01:42:37.235 --> 01:42:43.404]  We all know about the Texas Youth Commission and raping the kids and we all know about CPS and all the pedophiles that are in it.
[01:42:43.404 --> 01:42:47.210]  We all know you violate people's due process and we're sick of it!
[01:42:47.210 --> 01:42:50.656]  And they try to turn this around in a bunch of whining about us giving out their phone numbers.
[01:42:52.278 --> 01:42:54.880]  You know, number one, you shouldn't have your administrative numbers tied to 911.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.902]  You're not supposed to do that.
[01:42:56.902 --> 01:42:58.343]  I've looked at the regulations on that.
[01:42:58.343 --> 01:43:02.767]  It's supposed to be a separate phone system, and you know that!
[01:43:02.767 --> 01:43:05.169]  So don't try to blame the victims here.
[01:43:05.169 --> 01:43:10.954]  We're the ones that got crying mother here, and a crying little girl afraid to go home, to be snatched by you people.
[01:43:10.954 --> 01:43:14.197]  And you act like we're weird for not wanting to live under your tyranny!
[01:43:18.737 --> 01:43:20.198]  So we're done.
[01:43:20.198 --> 01:43:22.561]  But you notice the sheriff's being nebulous now.
[01:43:22.561 --> 01:43:25.604]  Oh, we're not sure what happened.
[01:43:25.604 --> 01:43:28.246]  Mr. Jones wasn't there, I wasn't there.
[01:43:28.246 --> 01:43:29.848]  They made her pull her pants off.
[01:43:29.848 --> 01:43:30.428]  Were they in there?
[01:43:30.428 --> 01:43:31.149]  I don't know.
[01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:32.470]  The media then turns it into that.
[01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:33.411]  We made clear on air.
[01:43:33.411 --> 01:43:34.532]  The men told her to do it.
[01:43:34.532 --> 01:43:35.833]  We're not sure if they were in there or not.
[01:43:36.690 --> 01:43:38.471]  Try talking to an eight-year-old.
[01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:40.172]  You ask them one question, they tell you another.
[01:43:40.172 --> 01:43:41.093]  So what were the men doing?
[01:43:41.093 --> 01:43:42.694]  They were with the cameras.
[01:43:42.694 --> 01:43:43.955]  Were they there when they did this?
[01:43:43.955 --> 01:43:44.996]  I'd ask them to close the window.
[01:43:44.996 --> 01:43:45.636]  Yeah?
[01:43:45.636 --> 01:43:46.677]  Then they were out.
[01:43:46.677 --> 01:43:48.618]  Well, were they there when they took your pants off?
[01:43:48.618 --> 01:43:49.279]  Turns red.
[01:43:49.279 --> 01:43:50.740]  I'm sorry, it was embarrassing.
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:54.662]  You know, it's a little girl, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:54.662 --> 01:43:56.984]  A little girl.
[01:43:56.984 --> 01:43:58.225]  And it's absolute crap.
[01:43:58.225 --> 01:43:59.566]  I've seen the photo her mother took.
[01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:01.387]  We didn't pull her pants down here at the office.
[01:44:01.387 --> 01:44:03.188]  Just right, almost down by her knee.
[01:44:03.188 --> 01:44:04.009]  Tiny bruise.
[01:44:06.161 --> 01:44:08.282]  How many of you, when you go home today, look at your kid's legs?
[01:44:08.282 --> 01:44:13.763]  I bet there's bruises all over them.
[01:44:13.763 --> 01:44:15.724]  I got a bruise on my knee.
[01:44:15.724 --> 01:44:19.205]  My mother had some little dog door for a French bulldog up.
[01:44:19.205 --> 01:44:25.667]  I was over there about two weeks ago, but walking around the corner, didn't look at this little bitty gate, tripped over it.
[01:44:25.667 --> 01:44:27.868]  I guess they're gonna, I've got a bruise on my knee.
[01:44:30.615 --> 01:44:31.616]  It's all over.
[01:44:31.616 --> 01:44:33.158]  How many of you right now have bruises on you?
[01:44:33.158 --> 01:44:33.598]  It's over.
[01:44:33.598 --> 01:44:34.199]  You're criminals.
[01:44:34.199 --> 01:44:35.600]  You beat yourself.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.302]  You need to go to a mental institution.
[01:44:37.302 --> 01:44:39.904]  You're not allowed to have bruises.
[01:44:39.904 --> 01:44:46.130]  You heard that CPS lawyer yesterday about how his wife on a long dress tripped on it, broke her nose.
[01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:51.475]  He took her to the doctor and they tried to arrest him saying she'd done that to him.
[01:44:51.475 --> 01:44:54.859]  How many of you have been in the emergency room yourself and asked if somebody did it to you?
[01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:58.751]  Somebody hurt you, somebody did this to you.
[01:44:58.751 --> 01:45:02.913]  You go to the doctor now and they ask you, they ask you about, do you have guns in your house?
[01:45:02.913 --> 01:45:04.694]  Alright, let's go to the phone calls.
[01:45:04.694 --> 01:45:06.315]  I just want to thank everybody.
[01:45:06.315 --> 01:45:12.237]  I want to commend everybody for the great job that they did and for helping my office out.
[01:45:12.237 --> 01:45:16.559]  You know, I can't help the literally hundreds of emails I get with people having their kids snatched.
[01:45:16.559 --> 01:45:23.022]  I turn them, you know, over to the referral of groups that help parents and we list those groups.
[01:45:23.022 --> 01:45:24.543]  We try to give folks those numbers but
[01:45:25.919 --> 01:45:30.867]  And it's always painful to hear the woman crying or the man crying and saying they want their baby back or their kid back.
[01:45:30.867 --> 01:45:31.889]  This is what makes me so angry.
[01:45:31.889 --> 01:45:33.371]  You know why I yell and scream and get angry?
[01:45:33.371 --> 01:45:36.456]  Because instead of ignoring all the evil in the world, I focus on it.
[01:45:36.456 --> 01:45:37.337]  I fight it.
[01:45:37.337 --> 01:45:39.761]  It's not because I'm some perfect good hero either.
[01:45:40.788 --> 01:45:41.628]  I care about kids.
[01:45:41.628 --> 01:45:42.748]  I care about people.
[01:45:42.748 --> 01:45:43.589]  I care about liberty.
[01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:44.689]  I care about freedom.
[01:45:44.689 --> 01:45:46.049]  John in Ohio disagrees.
[01:45:46.049 --> 01:45:46.849]  He goes ahead of the line.
[01:45:46.849 --> 01:45:48.270]  Then Phil, Fred, Mark, Dan.
[01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:49.870]  Go ahead, John.
[01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:56.071]  Yes, I always have to say I promoted and plugged some of your work on radio talk shows, but I do have disagreements.
[01:45:56.071 --> 01:45:56.892]  I've heard you, John.
[01:45:56.892 --> 01:46:02.393]  I've heard you plug me on Coast to Coast AM and other national shows, but that said, you've got to take me to the woodshed.
[01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:20.546]  Well, yeah, even though I consider myself an unaffiliated socialist and largely agree with groups like WSWS.org, I, well, first of all... I heard you doing a good job on a very good rant you did yesterday, or was it the day before, on Gary Brownfield.
[01:46:20.546 --> 01:46:23.587]  So why don't you do that rant again about the banker takeover.
[01:46:23.587 --> 01:46:25.087]  I thought that was great.
[01:46:25.087 --> 01:46:31.768]  Well, at this point, I would like to do a rant against the program on Gary Brownfield today.
[01:46:32.478 --> 01:46:36.660]  And this arsonist... Oh, wait a minute!
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:43.984]  When they were using the Bible, saying Libya is in the Bible, Libya is going to attack Israel, so we have World War III, what a load of baloney!
[01:46:43.984 --> 01:46:58.432]  Yeah, this Corsi character, this four-tongued chameleon hypocrite and arsonist who's been making a career for, it seems like decades, I've heard him on coast-to-coast setting up the most lurid and outrageous talk... Let me just fill in on this.
[01:46:58.432 --> 01:47:00.954]  I happen, see I get ready at my house for the radio show.
[01:47:01.618 --> 01:47:03.099]  And then I drive in at around 10 a.m.
[01:47:03.099 --> 01:47:09.641]  to the office, so I always, in the car, listen to Brownfield, because he's on local FM, as we are here in town.
[01:47:09.641 --> 01:47:14.962]  And so I'm driving and listening, so I happen to almost every day hear that, here on Genesis, right before me.
[01:47:14.962 --> 01:47:24.686]  And, yeah, I was kind of embarrassed and almost wanted to say something today, because, and I don't want to get in a fight with Corsi, but next time I have him on, I'm going to say, now you're a theologian!
[01:47:24.686 --> 01:47:30.228]  Now little, pathetic, disarmed, backward Libya is Gog and Magog.
[01:47:30.228 --> 01:47:31.228]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:47:31.667 --> 01:47:58.589]  Well, he was talking about the poor, disarmed little Israel, which has 500 nuclear weapons, pointing and threatening Iran and the United States, of course, with 10,000, that he's going there to have some kind of a comfortable welcoming and a nest there to write a book called Israel Can't Wait, an obvious reference to the idea that these alt-right fascist warmongers in Israel want to attack Iran.
[01:47:59.013 --> 01:48:13.942]  With the United States and Obama pretending that somehow they're the soft cop and they will then allow or encourage their breakaway mad dog Israel to attack and then we can say we haven't, we've got to support them now.
[01:48:13.942 --> 01:48:24.228]  Or, as Tarpley has said, they're going to go through the motions of talk in other ways, an ultimatum to surrender their sovereignty
[01:48:24.699 --> 01:48:30.101]  And their autonomy, and their economy, and when they can't do that, we'll say, we tried, you see.
[01:48:30.101 --> 01:48:43.405]  And even Rahm Emanuel, this total dual citizen of Israel, who's a chief of staff, has said, yes, if we go through some kind of a motion, this will give us a better opportunity to convince the public that we can attack Iran.
[01:48:43.405 --> 01:48:48.026]  And, of course, he was peddling this idea that somehow Obama... I'll say this.
[01:48:48.026 --> 01:48:48.766]  I'll say this.
[01:48:48.766 --> 01:48:49.247]  I'll say this.
[01:48:49.247 --> 01:48:50.647]  You know, we have Corsi on from time to time.
[01:48:50.647 --> 01:48:52.568]  I agree with some of what he says, and don't the others.
[01:48:52.568 --> 01:48:53.428]  We have open channels.
[01:48:54.188 --> 01:48:54.469]  I don't know.
[01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:17.254]  You know, the issue here is clearly NATO and the globalists are trying to encircle and start fights with Russia.
[01:49:17.254 --> 01:49:20.216]  Clearly, that's wrong.
[01:49:20.216 --> 01:49:22.678]  And the globalists told us how great NAFTA and GATT would be.
[01:49:22.678 --> 01:49:24.920]  They told us how great attacking Iran's going to be.
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.381]  It isn't going to be great.
[01:49:26.381 --> 01:49:28.262]  None of this is going to be great.
[01:49:28.262 --> 01:49:33.987]  And Iran is bending over backwards, groveling right now, even assisting, you know, the U.S.
[01:49:33.987 --> 01:49:38.710]  going after Shiites on their border and putting up with a lot.
[01:49:38.710 --> 01:49:39.911]  And we don't want World War III
[01:49:41.192 --> 01:49:41.432]  I think?
[01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:04.771]  99% of the people of the world, and it's going to help the bankers.
[01:50:04.771 --> 01:50:08.733]  This is the political diversion, as the Rand Corporation said three months ago.
[01:50:08.733 --> 01:50:14.656]  They need a global war on the scale of World War II to smokescreen their financial takeover.
[01:50:14.656 --> 01:50:15.217]  And so, folks,
[01:50:16.610 --> 01:50:18.671]  Israel is not some shrinking violent.
[01:50:18.671 --> 01:50:24.215]  They probably got more like 800 nukes, dolphin submarines, cruise missiles, supersonic fighter-bombers.
[01:50:24.215 --> 01:50:33.381]  I mean, Israel is, what, the fourth nuclear power on the planet, and is just absolutely bristling with weapons and high-tech systems.
[01:50:33.381 --> 01:50:35.743]  And nobody is going to mess with them.
[01:50:35.743 --> 01:50:38.164]  And they've got anti-missile defense systems, you name it.
[01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:39.826]  Iran is seven years from a nuke.
[01:50:40.606 --> 01:50:42.848]  And let's just say Iran's completely evil and bad.
[01:50:42.848 --> 01:50:45.651]  Fine, let's wait a few years before we have World War III.
[01:50:45.651 --> 01:50:50.916]  So, John, I hear ya, and it's just... goes from bad to worse, doesn't it?
[01:50:50.916 --> 01:50:53.959]  Okay, Phil, Fred, Mark, Dan, others, your call's coming up.
[01:50:53.959 --> 01:51:00.026]  Then in 40 minutes, they'll run us in studio, and then the one and the only... Jesse the Mind Ventura.
[01:51:01.041 --> 01:51:08.366]  Due to recent events related to the H1N1 virus, the Center for Disease Control has issued a public health emergency across the United States.

[01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:50.532]  Protecting you and your family one day at a time.
[01:52:01.576 --> 01:52:07.402]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.402 --> 01:52:14.370]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:21.484]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:21.484 --> 01:52:23.524]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:23.524 --> 01:52:26.025]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:26.025 --> 01:52:37.590]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.590 --> 01:52:39.270]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:40.631]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.118 --> 01:52:48.045]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:53:01.238 --> 01:53:03.219]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:53:03.219 --> 01:53:10.181]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:53:10.181 --> 01:53:18.563]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:53:18.563 --> 01:53:24.305]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[01:54:18.028 --> 01:54:19.629]  He's out there.
[01:54:19.629 --> 01:54:26.895]  He's now got these free silver one ounce bars he's giving out with the Ten Commandments on the back.
[01:54:26.895 --> 01:54:30.097]  Anybody that can list the Ten Commandments.

[01:54:36.144 --> 01:54:40.885]  I'm going to go to your phone calls right now until Daryl's on with us and blitz through important news today.
[01:54:40.885 --> 01:54:42.766]  Then Jesse Ventura is going to be joining us.
[01:54:42.766 --> 01:54:44.947]  Full hour coming up in about a week and a half.
[01:54:44.947 --> 01:54:47.087]  But I called him today and he said, how about I come on to you today?
[01:54:47.087 --> 01:54:48.428]  He is such a great guy.
[01:54:48.428 --> 01:54:49.688]  So that is coming up.
[01:54:49.688 --> 01:54:54.770]  Phil, Fred, Mark, Dan, others, your calls are coming up here in just a moment.
[01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:56.990]  I wanted to tell you about one of our sponsors.
[01:54:56.990 --> 01:55:00.951]  Before we do that, you can see them up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:00.951 --> 01:55:02.232]  It's Supernatural Silver.
[01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:04.732]  We're good to go.
[01:55:23.228 --> 01:55:23.488]  I think?
[01:55:40.788 --> 01:55:42.909]  Uh, sponsor, uh, as well.
[01:55:42.909 --> 01:55:44.211]  And we're going to go to your calls.
[01:55:44.211 --> 01:55:45.652]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:55:45.652 --> 01:55:47.113]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:55:47.113 --> 01:55:48.575]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[01:55:48.575 --> 01:55:51.598]  Electricians should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[01:55:51.598 --> 01:55:55.641]  A solar-powered generator is now available from our long-time sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:55:55.641 --> 01:55:59.465]  It is designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster.
[01:55:59.785 --> 01:56:00.265]  We're good to go.
[01:56:16.115 --> 01:56:19.838]  But in the blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:56:19.838 --> 01:56:22.981]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[01:56:22.981 --> 01:56:26.184]  The government doesn't own the sun, folks, yet, so make your move today.
[01:56:26.184 --> 01:56:27.866]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:56:27.866 --> 01:56:29.647]  That's MySolarBackup.com or 1-877-327-0365.
[01:56:29.647 --> 01:56:29.747]  1-877-327-0365.
[01:56:29.747 --> 01:56:31.969]  Okay, let's go ahead now back to your phone calls.
[01:56:31.969 --> 01:56:33.791]  Let's talk to Phil in Toronto.
[01:56:33.791 --> 01:56:34.972]  Phil, you're on the air.
[01:56:34.972 --> 01:56:35.893]  Go ahead.
[01:56:43.112 --> 01:56:44.354]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:56:44.354 --> 01:56:46.076]  Hey buddy, good to talk to you.
[01:56:46.076 --> 01:56:53.845]  I was just wondering, Alex, next week there's a speaking engagement with George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in Toronto.
[01:56:53.845 --> 01:56:58.310]  I was wondering if you knew about that and really if you knew about the purpose of it.
[01:57:01.343 --> 01:57:17.434]  You know, I'm doing a new thing where I have only an earpiece headset, and my audio wasn't real good right then, because what happens is I have an open ear, and then I hear all the talking through the door, and so I can't really do the show right now.
[01:57:17.434 --> 01:57:22.797]  So, that's the problem with going with an earpiece, because we're about to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:22.797 --> 01:57:23.918]  Go ahead and ask the question again.
[01:57:25.379 --> 01:57:26.340]  Okay, no problem, Alex.
[01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:32.204]  The question is, next week, George Bush and Bill Clinton are going to be speaking in Toronto.
[01:57:32.204 --> 01:57:38.648]  I was just wondering if you knew of the purpose of their speaking engagement and their visit.
[01:57:38.648 --> 01:57:39.929]  Is that George Bush Sr.
[01:57:39.929 --> 01:57:41.650]  or George Bush 43?
[01:57:41.650 --> 01:57:47.974]  George W. I get, well, I mean, we know Clinton and Bush Elder team up to push propaganda and U.N.
[01:57:47.974 --> 01:57:53.978]  takeover agendas, but again,
[01:57:56.178 --> 01:57:57.258]  I don't know why they're meeting.
[01:57:57.258 --> 01:57:58.699]  I mean, I miss a lot of stuff.
[01:57:58.699 --> 01:57:59.619]  You're here informing me.
[01:57:59.619 --> 01:58:01.640]  Tell me what you think they're doing.
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.480]  I'm not sure, Alex.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.240]  I have no idea.
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:06.961]  Unfortunately.
[01:58:06.961 --> 01:58:08.302]  Well, I will look into that.
[01:58:08.302 --> 01:58:10.142]  I will print a story up and look at that.
[01:58:10.142 --> 01:58:13.723]  But I mean, these guys are just corporate CEO pitchmen.
[01:58:13.723 --> 01:58:15.484]  They go around pitching New World Order activities.
[01:58:15.484 --> 01:58:17.044]  Anything else, Phil?
[01:58:17.044 --> 01:58:17.265]  No.
[01:58:17.265 --> 01:58:23.446]  I'll tell everyone in Toronto it's next Friday, the 29th.
[01:58:23.446 --> 01:58:24.647]  We Are Change is going to

[01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:59.022]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.603 --> 02:00:10.428]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.428 --> 02:00:12.009]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.009 --> 02:00:13.571]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.571 --> 02:00:17.755]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.755 --> 02:00:21.819]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.073 --> 02:00:26.355]  It is Thursday, the 21st day of May 2009.
[02:00:26.355 --> 02:00:30.738]  Jesse Ventura scheduled the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[02:00:30.738 --> 02:00:33.300]  Daryl Ronda is coming up in T-minus 30 minutes in the studio.
[02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:40.866]  Talk about viral marketing, You Do News, a bunch of other sites and operations he's starting.
[02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:47.091]  Successful marketer and businessman who's created a company generating over a billion bucks.
[02:00:47.091 --> 02:00:49.973]  So we'll be talking to him coming up.
[02:00:51.061 --> 02:00:53.782]  Alex, I want to say I think you did the right thing in supporting Janet.
[02:00:53.782 --> 02:00:57.843]  I think that the news report that you aired is contradictory on their part.
[02:00:57.843 --> 02:00:59.124]  They're implying that
[02:01:20.964 --> 02:01:23.628]  You know, you did something wrong.
[02:01:23.628 --> 02:01:34.624]  The fact is that if there's an eight year old in a situation where she's alone, she's going to do what is demanded of her.
[02:01:34.624 --> 02:01:36.086]  So it really is coercion.
[02:01:37.876 --> 02:01:46.822]  And I think that if you didn't do this support of Janet and her daughter, then they really would have gone farther because that's their pattern.
[02:01:46.822 --> 02:01:48.243]  No, they were coming to arrest her.
[02:01:48.243 --> 02:01:50.204]  They were coming to trump stuff up.
[02:01:50.204 --> 02:01:51.244]  They had the cops with her.
[02:01:51.244 --> 02:01:52.625]  We know what they do.
[02:01:52.625 --> 02:01:54.506]  And I just can't stand here.
[02:01:54.506 --> 02:01:56.107]  You know, I have a really good lawyer.
[02:01:57.150 --> 02:01:58.492]  Here in town, he's a family friend.
[02:01:58.492 --> 02:02:01.277]  That's really the only kind of lawyer you can trust these days.
[02:02:01.277 --> 02:02:08.528]  And he recommended in their law firm that one of the, and then later I learned he's one of the top family lawyers in Austin, and he hates the CPS.
[02:02:08.528 --> 02:02:11.373]  So he's taking the case with no retainer and half price.
[02:02:12.332 --> 02:02:12.692]  I don't know.
[02:02:29.992 --> 02:02:39.524]  To defend themselves, but it's a very bittersweet victory because I know there are millions of children every year whose lives they ruin who I can't help.
[02:02:39.524 --> 02:02:42.287]  And it really burns me.
[02:02:42.287 --> 02:02:48.014]  People can call it old-fashioned or call me weak because I care about all children, even children I don't know, but I have that instinct.
[02:02:48.715 --> 02:02:51.798]  That I want to take on people that go after kids and that tear up families.
[02:02:51.798 --> 02:02:54.782]  And again, oh, they're doing it for the good of the children.
[02:02:54.782 --> 02:02:55.262]  No.
[02:02:55.262 --> 02:02:57.024]  No one abuses children more than government.
[02:02:57.024 --> 02:02:58.405]  That's their own facts.
[02:02:58.405 --> 02:03:00.868]  And it's filled with pedophiles and scum.
[02:03:00.868 --> 02:03:02.470]  And I declare war on the scum.
[02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:04.372]  And we just have to start hating these people.
[02:03:04.372 --> 02:03:07.355]  I have a deep, abiding, it's so deep I can't even describe it.
[02:03:07.355 --> 02:03:09.417]  The only thing deeper is my love of good people.
[02:03:09.417 --> 02:03:10.878]  But I have a hatred so deep
[02:03:11.579 --> 02:03:14.760]  Alex, we're all in it together because you're talking about a citizen, her daughter is a citizen,
[02:03:41.184 --> 02:03:42.025]  I don't know.
[02:03:59.861 --> 02:04:03.744]  The issue of his base requiring him to turn over his gun information?
[02:04:03.744 --> 02:04:06.606]  Yes, we got sent by him.
[02:04:06.606 --> 02:04:08.627]  I guess he was concerned that we hadn't talked about it yet.
[02:04:08.627 --> 02:04:13.170]  And we learned it was a month old news and actually been in the news.
[02:04:13.170 --> 02:04:16.832]  And that we've confirmed it's going on at some other bases.
[02:04:16.832 --> 02:04:20.675]  The media is trying to say it's just that base and the commander was wrong.
[02:04:20.675 --> 02:04:25.358]  But no, our whole breaking news here is this is not just that base.
[02:04:25.358 --> 02:04:26.499]  That's the breaking issue.
[02:04:27.419 --> 02:04:39.548]  You know, just the first time in history that they've gone in that direction.
[02:04:39.548 --> 02:04:49.015]  And I had called up Gary Brownfield when I heard about it, and I suggested that anyone who's affected by this should try to get a federal court injunction against it.
[02:04:49.923 --> 02:04:56.418]  Uh, and you know it also would apply to somebody living off the base, maybe even living... No, no, it's outrageous.
[02:04:56.418 --> 02:04:57.781]  They're coming after the guns.
[02:04:57.781 --> 02:04:59.224]  They got bills introduced to ban them.
[02:05:01.038 --> 02:05:02.719]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.719 --> 02:05:07.463]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:05:07.463 --> 02:05:10.425]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:05:10.425 --> 02:05:13.468]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:05:13.468 --> 02:05:17.271]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[02:05:17.271 --> 02:05:22.795]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:05:22.795 --> 02:05:25.077]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift
[02:05:31.437 --> 02:05:31.737]  We're good.
[02:06:01.556 --> 02:06:07.385]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.385 --> 02:06:14.416]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:06:14.958 --> 02:06:21.541]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:21.541 --> 02:06:23.521]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:23.521 --> 02:06:26.022]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:26.022 --> 02:06:37.587]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:06:37.587 --> 02:06:39.267]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.267 --> 02:06:40.628]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:06:41.118 --> 02:06:48.023]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:06:56.289 --> 02:06:57.870]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:57.870 --> 02:06:59.051]  The people strike back.
[02:07:02.296 --> 02:07:03.437]  Spring is here.
[02:07:03.437 --> 02:07:04.397]  Growing season.
[02:07:04.397 --> 02:07:06.598]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:07:06.598 --> 02:07:08.299]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:07:08.299 --> 02:07:09.280]  Think about it.
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:13.362]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:07:13.362 --> 02:07:17.044]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:07:17.044 --> 02:07:19.886]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:07:19.886 --> 02:07:31.752]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:07:32.072 --> 02:07:32.492]  Let's do it!
[02:08:02.023 --> 02:08:04.805]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.805 --> 02:08:07.587]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:39.344 --> 02:08:45.348]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:45.348 --> 02:08:52.692]  We have an hour and 52 minutes left in the show today.
[02:08:52.692 --> 02:08:55.393]  And I'm about to go right back to your phone calls.
[02:08:55.393 --> 02:09:03.638]  We have Jesse Ventura joining us coming up later in the next hour, and we have Daryl Rundis in studio coming up in about 25 minutes.
[02:09:03.638 --> 02:09:06.000]  As promised, let's continue with your calls.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.040]  Mark in Oregon.
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:08.001]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:09:08.001 --> 02:09:08.321]  Welcome.
[02:09:09.079 --> 02:09:10.339]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:09:10.339 --> 02:09:11.839]  Good afternoon to you.
[02:09:11.839 --> 02:09:13.140]  Good afternoon to you.
[02:09:13.140 --> 02:09:14.960]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:30.383]  Alex, this past Monday I was listening to a live broadcast of Rick Wildshow, and he interviewed Congressman Steve King of the 5th District of Iowa.
[02:09:30.383 --> 02:09:37.064]  Congressman King sits on the Judiciary Committee, and he's been in Congress for about seven years.
[02:09:38.442 --> 02:09:44.565]  He said that, I believe this meeting was on that same Monday of the show, about three days ago.
[02:09:44.565 --> 02:10:07.937]  He said that in committee, uh, Congressman Al C. Hastings, relative to the, uh, ongoing hate crimes legislation, which is moving through Congress, that Congressman Hastings named off 30 different philias, as he termed them, such as pedophilia and various necrophilia, perhaps, I don't know.
[02:10:09.311 --> 02:10:30.544]  uh... but thirty really is all together which he proposed and directed would be covered and protected and this upcoming hate crimes bill which is moving very quickly here i know that's big news that's confirmed a river river and had like another some point out the subsections nambla is involved it actually protects pedophiles
[02:10:31.209 --> 02:10:31.790]  Yeah.
[02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:38.456]  And so they want to come after you with hate crimes laws for pedophilia, because that's who runs things, is the pedophile guilds.
[02:10:38.456 --> 02:10:41.879]  That's the dominant subgroup out there.
[02:10:41.879 --> 02:10:45.543]  It goes across racial and religious lines, but that's what we're talking about.
[02:10:45.543 --> 02:10:52.550]  And then also, more important than even that is, see everybody's focused on the hate crimes bill, which is fine, but that's nothing.
[02:10:53.530 --> 02:11:05.460]  Because that says, if you commit a crime, then we're going to charge you and prosecute you and give you two or three times more time in prison if you do it to the protected pedophiles or this or that group.
[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:10.604]  The Cyber Bullying Act is a million times worse and nobody's talking about this!
[02:11:11.474 --> 02:11:30.394]  In the liberty movement, and I don't understand it, it's even in Reuters and Hannah Montana's on TV pushing it, you know, as her character, to the kids, that if you quote, bully someone, criticize someone online, say something that hurts someone's feelings, and that's what they do in Europe, they say, well this could incite violence, this could hurt someone's feelings, you get arrested.
[02:11:30.394 --> 02:11:31.955]  A federal felony
[02:11:32.916 --> 02:11:34.738]  In fact, guys, Google it for folks on screen.
[02:11:34.738 --> 02:11:38.521]  Hannah Montana.
[02:11:38.521 --> 02:11:40.062]  Or use her real name.
[02:11:40.062 --> 02:11:42.203]  Her stage name also pulls it up.
[02:11:42.203 --> 02:11:43.845]  Pushes for Cyberbullying Act.
[02:11:43.845 --> 02:11:45.466]  And then read the Cyberbullying Act.
[02:11:45.466 --> 02:11:47.027]  This is the big enchilada.
[02:11:47.027 --> 02:11:51.191]  This just says no free speech, period.
[02:11:51.191 --> 02:11:54.913]  If you wanted to, I'm sure that Representative King would come on the show.
[02:11:54.913 --> 02:11:59.257]  Because he offered an amendment in committee that same day, this past Monday, I believe.
[02:12:00.051 --> 02:12:06.495]  Which would have excluded pedophiles in particular from having protections under this coming legislation.
[02:12:06.495 --> 02:12:11.698]  What happens, Alex, to the bills, excuse me, to the state laws which prohibit this?
[02:12:11.698 --> 02:12:22.564]  I don't know if there are any federal laws which prohibit child molestation and child abuse sexually, but all 50 states must have strict laws against this.
[02:12:22.564 --> 02:12:26.066]  Is this upcoming hate crimes legislation and Congress wants
[02:12:26.616 --> 02:12:27.797]  It may be approved.
[02:12:27.797 --> 02:12:33.459]  Is it going to supersede and negate the legality of all of the state laws?
[02:12:33.459 --> 02:12:34.979]  Well, that's what the feds are doing.
[02:12:34.979 --> 02:12:37.280]  And look, I didn't ever imagine this.
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:44.943]  I never had an inkling that devil worshippers, pedophiles, sickos ran the New World Order.
[02:12:44.943 --> 02:12:49.245]  But when you actually study this, you find out that's who they are.
[02:12:49.245 --> 02:12:53.527]  And so, of course, they're trying to legalize in England sex with children as young as 10.
[02:12:55.047 --> 02:12:57.688]  And they want to arrest you if you criticize them.
[02:12:57.688 --> 02:12:58.668]  See, this is what they do.
[02:12:58.668 --> 02:13:01.069]  They arrest you if you criticize them.
[02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:02.569]  They come after your free speech.
[02:13:02.569 --> 02:13:14.972]  And that's why, you know, whether somebody is a black extremist or a Hispanic extremist or a white, you know, racist or whatever, I don't agree with their views, but I'll fight to the death for their views.
[02:13:15.552 --> 02:13:21.014]  But see, they sell the general public in Europe and the US and Canada and Australia and New Zealand where they're passing all this.
[02:13:21.014 --> 02:13:23.835]  Oh, you're not for Nazis that want to kill Jews, are you?
[02:13:23.835 --> 02:13:27.237]  You're not for Nazis saying that the Holocaust didn't happen.
[02:13:27.237 --> 02:13:34.540]  Well, whether you disagree with that idea or not, and whether it's despicable or not, which obviously, you know, Hitler killed a bunch of Jews and it's, you know...
[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:44.565]  There's an attempt to say he didn't do any of that, which is ridiculous, but you have to fight to the death for people's rights to say that, because then the precedent's set for everything else.
[02:13:44.565 --> 02:13:50.868]  And we're going to put on screen right now, there's the Curt Nemo, Corporate Media Exploits Teen Idol to Push Cyberbullying Bill.
[02:13:50.868 --> 02:13:56.610]  Put that Infowars.com story up on screen again, then click on the top of the second paragraph where it says Reuters.
[02:13:56.610 --> 02:14:01.312]  Because folks will see Infowars watching this on YouTube and BlipTV and say, oh, that's not real.
[02:14:01.312 --> 02:14:03.994]  Well, you click on Reuters, and then you can read
[02:14:05.066 --> 02:14:21.925]  The article where they say, oh isn't it great, she's pushing to do this, this is going to be so wonderful, and then you go read the bill itself and it actually says that if you criticize somebody, and they say it hurts their feelings, and they sign an affidavit, you go to prison.
[02:14:22.822 --> 02:14:24.583]  So this is just outrageous.
[02:14:24.583 --> 02:14:26.323]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:14:26.323 --> 02:14:27.644]  Let's talk, and there it is.
[02:14:27.644 --> 02:14:29.444]  Miley Cyrus blasts cyberbullies.
[02:14:29.444 --> 02:14:33.125]  That's the real name of the teen idol.
[02:14:33.125 --> 02:14:37.347]  Miley Cyrus has a message for internet critics calling her fat.
[02:14:37.347 --> 02:14:39.267]  See, they write it like it's her personally.
[02:14:39.267 --> 02:14:43.009]  Cyberbullying can seriously scar people, leading them to hurt themselves.
[02:14:43.009 --> 02:14:46.670]  So they go on to say, anything that hurts someone's feelings will be a federal felony.
[02:14:47.150 --> 02:14:49.512]  You can read that this is actually happening.
[02:14:49.512 --> 02:14:56.257]  They actually have bills introduced where if you're on the no-fly list, it's over a million people and it means expanded everything, no Second Amendment.
[02:14:56.257 --> 02:14:57.499]  See, this is all happening.
[02:14:57.499 --> 02:15:01.822]  No judge, no jury, indefinite detention for citizens, and you think it's for Al-Qaeda.
[02:15:01.822 --> 02:15:04.544]  And Obama's saying, I'm going to follow the Bill of Rights.
[02:15:04.544 --> 02:15:05.745]  Indefinite detention.
[02:15:05.745 --> 02:15:06.846]  That's not following the Bill of Rights.
[02:15:06.846 --> 02:15:09.048]  That's a trick he's playing.
[02:15:09.048 --> 02:15:13.692]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Vegas.
[02:15:13.692 --> 02:15:14.452]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:15:14.452 --> 02:15:14.813]  Go ahead.
[02:15:15.838 --> 02:15:20.619]  Hey Alex, first off, I want to say I love your show and stuff.
[02:15:20.619 --> 02:15:34.782]  I know there's been a lot of problems with YouTube lately and somebody on the Prison Planet forums, another Infowarrior, he bought the domain InfowarsTV.com and he's running it the same as YouTube.
[02:15:34.782 --> 02:15:38.283]  He's having videos on there and stuff.
[02:15:38.283 --> 02:15:41.464]  But I believe that's just YouTube videos they post on there though.
[02:15:42.213 --> 02:15:53.137]  Well, it's all the videos, you know, like, um, it's not just InfoWars videos, like, it's not just, you know, your videos and stuff, but it's, you know, all sorts of videos useful for the InfoWars.
[02:15:53.137 --> 02:15:55.238]  But you're not listening to what I'm saying.
[02:15:55.238 --> 02:15:59.800]  I believe, last time I checked that, it's posting YouTube videos.
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:03.642]  Well, no, he actually has the videos stored on the server.
[02:16:03.642 --> 02:16:04.422]  Well, that's good.
[02:16:04.422 --> 02:16:04.762]  That's good.
[02:16:04.762 --> 02:16:08.023]  The problem is, I wonder if we link to that, whether they can handle the traffic.
[02:16:08.023 --> 02:16:10.905]  I mean, can they handle 20, can they handle in one day a video getting 20,000 downloads?
[02:16:12.401 --> 02:16:17.284]  Well, I'm pretty sure they can because, you know, sorry.
[02:16:17.284 --> 02:16:18.184]  Well, send me a link.
[02:16:18.184 --> 02:16:20.606]  Send me a link and I'll check it out, okay?
[02:16:20.606 --> 02:16:21.546]  Alright.
[02:16:21.546 --> 02:16:23.227]  What's the name of it again?
[02:16:23.227 --> 02:16:26.609]  InfowarsTV.com.
[02:16:26.609 --> 02:16:29.971]  He has a pretty high bandwidth limit and stuff.
[02:16:29.971 --> 02:16:33.733]  He put a lot of money into it, so he should be able to handle all the traffic.
[02:16:33.733 --> 02:16:34.794]  Maybe we should talk to him.
[02:16:34.794 --> 02:16:36.495]  Yeah, that's very exciting.
[02:16:36.495 --> 02:16:37.435]  Okay, thank you so much.
[02:16:37.435 --> 02:16:37.856]  Anything else?
[02:16:38.793 --> 02:16:45.312]  Um, and aside from that, just the whole cyberbullying act, like, I came across that before, you know, when, like, when it first came around.
[02:16:45.748 --> 02:16:53.854]  You know, on all the internet forums and stuff, and it's just absolutely insane how anybody can possibly just turn away from that.
[02:16:53.854 --> 02:16:59.577]  Like, they're seriously trying to put people in prison for two years because you hurt somebody's feelings.
[02:16:59.577 --> 02:17:00.718]  And that's each count.
[02:17:00.718 --> 02:17:02.279]  Yeah, and hundreds of thousands in fines.
[02:17:02.279 --> 02:17:03.520]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:07.403]  Yeah, for about two weeks since we learned of this, and then it was racing through Congress.
[02:17:07.403 --> 02:17:09.584]  I mean, it's got White House support and
[02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:13.731]  Media icon support.
[02:17:13.731 --> 02:17:14.772]  The media is pushing this.
[02:17:14.772 --> 02:17:17.013]  I mean, I watched TV like 30 minutes yesterday.
[02:17:17.013 --> 02:17:24.157]  I said this earlier in the show and saw the news pushing the Cyberbullying Act and Hannah Montana.
[02:17:24.157 --> 02:17:27.999]  I know that's not her real name, but she's pushing it as the character.
[02:17:27.999 --> 02:17:29.780]  This is a PR stunt.
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:32.841]  And she's pushing it as Ms.
[02:17:32.841 --> 02:17:38.024]  Cyrus, the real person.
[02:17:41.701 --> 02:17:44.962]  And people keep emailing going, why aren't you talking about the hate crimes bill?
[02:17:44.962 --> 02:17:45.362]  I am!
[02:17:45.362 --> 02:17:47.302]  We linked to it months ago.
[02:17:47.302 --> 02:17:47.943]  We've covered it.
[02:17:47.943 --> 02:17:49.263]  I covered it last week.
[02:17:49.263 --> 02:17:51.764]  That is nothing!
[02:17:51.764 --> 02:17:54.044]  I don't know how to explain this to people.
[02:17:54.044 --> 02:17:55.845]  That's bad enough.
[02:17:55.845 --> 02:18:04.347]  It says, if you mug a heterosexual, then you get a year in jail.
[02:18:04.347 --> 02:18:05.007]  You know, basically.
[02:18:05.007 --> 02:18:07.828]  But if you mug a homosexual, you can get 20 years in jail.
[02:18:08.635 --> 02:18:09.735]  It's basically boiling it down.
[02:18:09.735 --> 02:18:12.716]  I'm like, well, how about you get 20 years if you mug either person?
[02:18:12.716 --> 02:18:16.478]  You know, let's have equal rights under the law.
[02:18:16.478 --> 02:18:18.418]  Not special rights.
[02:18:18.418 --> 02:18:26.581]  And then also what's going to happen is government is going to selectively enforce this right here.
[02:18:26.581 --> 02:18:32.623]  They're going to selectively enforce the hate crimes bill on whoever they want.
[02:18:33.479 --> 02:18:36.040]  I mean, it's already hard to get the cops out when you get mugged now.
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:40.322]  Because they're too busy out writing tickets and collecting data and kidnapping kids when under orders.
[02:18:40.322 --> 02:18:44.304]  I mean, they're too busy milking the cows.
[02:18:44.304 --> 02:18:45.124]  Us, the slaves.
[02:18:45.124 --> 02:18:48.606]  So, that's going on and that's happening.
[02:18:48.606 --> 02:18:53.108]  But, can I please get people concerned about the Cyberbullying Act?
[02:18:53.108 --> 02:18:57.570]  Because I mean, I go around all the other Patriot sites and I mean, I don't see people talking about it.
[02:18:57.570 --> 02:18:59.531]  I'm like, where is the disconnect?
[02:19:00.219 --> 02:19:00.719]  To this.
[02:19:00.719 --> 02:19:07.946]  We're writing articles every two or three days about this for two weeks straight and it's strange.
[02:19:07.946 --> 02:19:13.111]  I'll do some little story or issue and it goes mega viral and everybody talks about it and links to it and covers it.
[02:19:13.111 --> 02:19:21.258]  And then I will be pointing out major stuff, bills, Reuters, MTV pushing it, and people just don't pick up on it.
[02:19:21.258 --> 02:19:22.899]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[02:19:22.899 --> 02:19:25.422]  This bill is racing through Congress.
[02:19:26.002 --> 02:19:32.404]  So is the no-fly, no-buy guns list, where they'll also come out and take your guns.
[02:19:32.404 --> 02:19:33.344]  No judge, no jury.
[02:19:33.344 --> 02:19:34.685]  They just put you on a magic list.
[02:19:34.685 --> 02:19:35.665]  No way to get off of it.
[02:19:35.665 --> 02:19:37.345]  No way to tell you why you got on it.
[02:19:37.345 --> 02:19:39.646]  Just the end of the entire Bill of Rights.
[02:19:39.646 --> 02:19:40.806]  End of habeas corpus.
[02:19:40.806 --> 02:19:42.547]  End of everything.
[02:19:42.547 --> 02:19:44.868]  And that's not even a big deal.
[02:19:44.868 --> 02:19:48.209]  I mean, I think we know what's a big deal and what's not.
[02:19:48.209 --> 02:19:52.690]  So if you want us to, we'll come cover the hate crime bill and repeat the bill number over and over again.
[02:19:52.690 --> 02:19:54.951]  And it's bad, but it's nothing compared to this.
[02:19:55.831 --> 02:19:59.393]  You know, it's like a BB gun compared to a .357 Magnum.
[02:19:59.393 --> 02:20:01.594]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.594 --> 02:20:05.876]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food.
[02:20:05.876 --> 02:20:10.258]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food.
[02:20:10.258 --> 02:20:14.740]  During the Great Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:20.983]  And as America continues down its current path, for many, the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[02:20:21.503 --> 02:20:29.152]  With massive layoffs and unemployment at record levels, growing your own food will help you save money that you'd normally spend at the grocery store.
[02:20:29.152 --> 02:20:35.279]  Invest in your family's future by stocking up with your very own supply of seeds available from getseeds.net.
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:38.582]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:21:05.074 --> 02:21:07.916]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.916 --> 02:21:13.799]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:21:13.799 --> 02:21:20.302]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:20.302 --> 02:21:22.263]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:22.263 --> 02:21:24.725]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:24.725 --> 02:21:34.470]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[02:21:34.932 --> 02:21:37.913]  That's fascist.
[02:21:37.913 --> 02:21:39.573]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.573 --> 02:21:41.434]  It's about a one world government.
[02:21:41.434 --> 02:21:48.336]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.336 --> 02:21:56.599]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.599 --> 02:21:58.179]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.179 --> 02:22:02.861]  The people strike back.
[02:22:02.861 --> 02:22:03.981]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:04.434 --> 02:22:10.475]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, and investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:22:10.475 --> 02:22:21.618]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:22:21.618 --> 02:22:29.260]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:29.744 --> 02:22:35.227]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:22:35.227 --> 02:22:41.050]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:41.050 --> 02:22:45.552]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:22:45.552 --> 02:22:45.832]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:45.832 --> 02:22:47.813]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:22:47.813 --> 02:22:48.414]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.414 --> 02:22:48.694]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.756 --> 02:23:07.283]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:23:07.283 --> 02:23:08.064]  and the world.
[02:23:08.064 --> 02:23:11.929]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:23:11.929 --> 02:23:18.437]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:23:18.437 --> 02:23:20.159]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:23:20.439 --> 02:23:21.080]  We're good to go.
[02:23:43.959 --> 02:23:44.299]  We're good to go.
[02:24:27.718 --> 02:24:31.220]  John Harmon, my call list here.
[02:24:31.220 --> 02:24:34.942]  Who's up next?
[02:24:34.942 --> 02:24:37.083]  All right, Steward and Mass, you are on the air.
[02:24:37.083 --> 02:24:37.723]  Thanks for holding.
[02:24:37.723 --> 02:24:40.865]  Hey, good afternoon.
[02:24:40.865 --> 02:24:43.206]  Hey, buddy.
[02:24:43.206 --> 02:24:47.628]  I had a few things to say that I was just going to get off the air.
[02:24:47.628 --> 02:24:51.990]  The first thing that I wanted to say is, using the information on this show,
[02:24:53.370 --> 02:24:56.452]  I was able to pretty much take over a radio show.
[02:24:56.452 --> 02:25:10.318]  At first, everyone laughed at me, but I was able to take over a show to the point where the host started having local organic food farmers on and started talking about, you know, mercury in the vaccines and all that stuff.
[02:25:11.099 --> 02:25:13.741]  And so thanks to you for that.
[02:25:13.741 --> 02:25:16.623]  I was able to... How in the New World Order?
[02:25:27.350 --> 02:25:31.173]  And that's what's happening is people know the truth in their gut when they hear it.
[02:25:31.173 --> 02:25:33.956]  And this information is explosive right now.
[02:25:33.956 --> 02:25:35.637]  And it's going to continue to be explosive.
[02:25:35.637 --> 02:25:37.418]  And it's going to intensify.
[02:25:37.418 --> 02:25:39.540]  And the people's hunger for it's going to intensify.
[02:25:39.540 --> 02:25:42.463]  That's why they've got counterfeits like Glenn Beck.
[02:25:42.463 --> 02:25:48.648]  But those counterfeits are only going to blow up in the establishment's face and get people to want to then find the real thing.
[02:25:50.157 --> 02:25:51.398]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:25:51.398 --> 02:26:10.312]  When you get into a new hobby, at first you buy the junky model of something, or you think you know about it, and you find out you got screwed, or you know, you didn't fully understand it, and then you find out there's a lot better thing, and then, oh, there's even more to know, and then somebody claims they've got something even better, and you find out, no, that wasn't real, this was the real McCoy.
[02:26:10.312 --> 02:26:11.693]  It's like wine tasting.
[02:26:11.693 --> 02:26:16.537]  People are, or cigars, or things people like, people are developing a taste
[02:26:17.497 --> 02:26:39.725]  Yeah, I got people riled up to the point there was like 80-year-old women calling up saying we needed to march on Washington, but then I had to go to the point you said where, no, we can't march on Washington, you know, and I laid out their whole plan for that with neutron bombs or whatever.
[02:26:41.286 --> 02:26:51.771]  Well, the Pentagon and the British Ministry of Defense have said, and we've shown the documents, they're public, London Guardian's reported on it, that they said if people tried to march on Western capitals, that the neutron bomb arsenal is for us.
[02:26:51.771 --> 02:27:02.356]  Or if Congress rebelled, or Parliament rebelled, and got up and had a press conference and said, there's a shadow government, we're arresting them, the neutron bombs are basically already planted in each city, probably right under Parliament, and they just go...
[02:27:03.857 --> 02:27:06.639]  Oh, terrorists too!
[02:27:06.639 --> 02:27:24.090]  So we have to understand, we have to take over the counties, the cities, then be aware, then have intelligence operations, expose, they've got the neutron weapons in place, and space-based, the DU-SABO, meteor gun technology, in the encircling
[02:27:25.549 --> 02:27:28.871]  Black Manta Space Planes, that's declassifying.
[02:27:28.871 --> 02:27:31.053]  And I've talked to the former head of Star Wars admitting that.
[02:27:31.053 --> 02:27:41.039]  So we have to expose globalist decapitation system for elites, the neutron bomb control grid, the financial heart plug, they can pull that and make us collapse and bleed to death.
[02:27:41.039 --> 02:27:43.260]  They can stage nuclear attacks, claim Al Qaeda did it.
[02:27:43.260 --> 02:27:46.903]  You have to fully inoculate the public psychologically to their program.
[02:27:47.779 --> 02:27:56.126]  And then take over the counties, the cities, the states from that perspective and just say no, no, no to all their programs and then that will render them defenseless.
[02:27:56.126 --> 02:28:02.632]  That's why they're trying to shift to their robotic aircraft, robotic tanks, pre-programmed hover control drones.
[02:28:05.430 --> 02:28:14.637]  To carry out the globalist orders, so even if their own military says no, they can also then launch fake attacks with their robot aircraft and say humans did it.
[02:28:14.637 --> 02:28:16.698]  You can see the technocracy they're building.
[02:28:16.698 --> 02:28:18.960]  The enemy is weak now if we expose them.
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:22.463]  The deeper we get into this, the harder it's going to be to stop Skynet.
[02:28:23.163 --> 02:28:26.806]  And by the way, that's what they called it 40 years ago, would be Skynet with the robotic aircraft.
[02:28:26.806 --> 02:28:27.807]  The Air Force said that.
[02:28:27.807 --> 02:28:30.729]  See, when you see movies like Terminator, that's throwing it in your face.
[02:28:30.729 --> 02:28:33.151]  But Skynet doesn't work for the machines.
[02:28:33.151 --> 02:28:37.734]  It works for the eugenicist New World Order, and they plan a Terminator-type scenario for us.
[02:28:37.734 --> 02:28:40.496]  Can I just say two more things real quick?
[02:28:40.496 --> 02:28:42.397]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:28:42.397 --> 02:28:43.458]  I called up my spirits.
[02:28:43.458 --> 02:28:45.500]  We're down a couple weeks ago, but I'm getting them back.
[02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:48.922]  It's funny you bring up CPS, because it was over that.
[02:28:48.922 --> 02:28:50.784]  I fought CPS for three years.
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:29:03.108]  I lost our kids three times, got them back three times, but the last time my wife threw me under the bus, lied, said I did some things I didn't, and I'm facing jail time actually, but I don't care.
[02:29:03.108 --> 02:29:17.437]  Anyway, also, I heard Russia is where the people from Gog and Magog moved to, from my research, and New World Order, if I do go to jail on false charges, I don't care, when I get out of jail, I'm gonna fight even harder now.
[02:29:17.437 --> 02:29:19.598]  I'm gonna fight even harder.
[02:29:19.598 --> 02:29:20.399]  Good day, Alex Jones.
[02:29:21.107 --> 02:29:24.749]  Well, just fight it all the way and don't plea bargain, and 80% of the time you'll beat them.
[02:29:24.749 --> 02:29:25.670]  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:27.531]  I'm going all the way to trial.
[02:29:27.531 --> 02:29:29.152]  Look, these people are all such criminals.
[02:29:29.152 --> 02:29:32.154]  Just start following the CPS workers with a night vision camera.
[02:29:32.154 --> 02:29:36.076]  You'll catch them buying drugs or picking up little kids they're going to rape or whatever.
[02:29:36.076 --> 02:29:40.999]  And then you just put that on YouTube and they all go to jail and you go, ha, ha, ha, ha, you've been defeated again.
[02:29:40.999 --> 02:29:43.821]  Because I'm going to tell you, most of these people are hardcore criminals.
[02:29:43.821 --> 02:29:45.602]  You investigate them, you're going to find the crime.
[02:29:45.602 --> 02:29:46.303]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:46.303 --> 02:29:47.604]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:47.604 --> 02:29:48.044]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.624 --> 02:29:55.547]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.547 --> 02:30:01.512]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:01.329 --> 02:31:03.890]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:31:04.511 --> 02:31:07.137]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:07.137 --> 02:31:14.153]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:31:14.705 --> 02:31:21.231]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:21.231 --> 02:31:23.293]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:23.293 --> 02:31:25.775]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:25.775 --> 02:31:37.366]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:31:37.366 --> 02:31:39.048]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.048 --> 02:31:40.409]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:31:40.879 --> 02:31:47.783]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:56.048 --> 02:31:57.629]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:57.629 --> 02:31:58.790]  The people strike back.
[02:32:00.868 --> 02:32:03.331]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[02:32:03.331 --> 02:32:07.135]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[02:32:07.135 --> 02:32:09.939]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:32:09.939 --> 02:32:17.147]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[02:32:17.287 --> 02:32:22.372]  Having your hard-earned money in banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is a lose-lose deal.
[02:32:22.372 --> 02:32:27.497]  You'll lose on your capital investment and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar continues to devalue.
[02:32:27.497 --> 02:32:33.603]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[02:32:33.723 --> 02:32:37.884]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[02:32:37.884 --> 02:32:43.686]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:32:43.686 --> 02:32:48.728]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[02:32:48.728 --> 02:32:53.190]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:55.831]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[02:32:55.831 --> 02:32:56.311]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:33:06.877 --> 02:33:09.178]  We are back live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:09.178 --> 02:33:11.578]  Daryl Rundis is in the studio with us.
[02:33:11.578 --> 02:33:16.380]  Before we go back to him and your phone calls, we'll have calls throughout this interview with him because he can talk on any subject.
[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:16.860]  Great guy.
[02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:21.441]  I'm like a little Jawa or something here, pitching my wares.
[02:33:21.441 --> 02:33:24.722]  The reason we're doing this is not just to fund our operation.
[02:33:24.722 --> 02:33:32.665]  It is because this is how you meet like-minded people when you go to church or school or out to restaurants or out to eat or to volleyball or whatever you're doing.
[02:33:33.710 --> 02:34:02.232]  uh... socialism defend yourself and the message is the socialist he's got the gun he's taking your money defend yourself info wars dot com and on the back says info wars dot com very simple gets the message out here is our bestseller right now it's the uh... take off on the texas come and take a flag they came to take the guns but it's got the symbol of resistance today the kalashnikov right there come and take it there's a warm for your mind info wars dot com it's got the distressed look
[02:34:03.132 --> 02:34:04.813]  People keep calling us old-timers.
[02:34:04.813 --> 02:34:09.455]  When they get these years, they go, the corner of these words didn't bleed all the way through.
[02:34:09.455 --> 02:34:11.715]  Your silk printing isn't working.
[02:34:11.715 --> 02:34:11.975]  No, no.
[02:34:11.975 --> 02:34:13.776]  It's meant to have that distressed look.
[02:34:13.776 --> 02:34:14.616]  That's called distress.
[02:34:14.616 --> 02:34:15.677]  That's the style.
[02:34:15.677 --> 02:34:17.878]  Here's our second bestseller.
[02:34:17.878 --> 02:34:19.038]  It's the old come and take it.
[02:34:19.038 --> 02:34:21.419]  They say you're a terrorist if you basically wear this.
[02:34:21.419 --> 02:34:28.682]  And on the back it says, the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants, Thomas Jefferson and other evil terrorists who believed in freedom.
[02:34:30.268 --> 02:34:32.169]  And here is the shirt I was wearing yesterday.
[02:34:32.169 --> 02:34:34.430]  This is the InfoWars Defend Freedom on the back.
[02:34:34.430 --> 02:34:38.531]  On the front, Live Free or Die, with a Minuteman busting through the U.S.
[02:34:38.531 --> 02:34:41.973]  seal, InfoWars.com.
[02:34:41.973 --> 02:34:50.556]  So, very, very exciting t-shirts that I kind of had the ideas for, but then Janae Meadows, an unbelievable graphics artist, did and we just love her to death.
[02:34:50.556 --> 02:34:54.538]  A bunch of other t-shirts at InfoWars.com or call toll free to get those, 888.
[02:34:55.538 --> 02:34:55.658]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9
[02:35:25.758 --> 02:35:26.178]  Yes, we are.
[02:35:43.806 --> 02:35:44.146]  We're good to go.
[02:36:07.677 --> 02:36:10.800]  Going from 3,000 square feet to 7,000 square feet would have been enough.
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:11.861]  Now it's not enough.
[02:36:11.861 --> 02:36:16.424]  Luckily, well, blessedly, right next to us is 7,000 more square feet.
[02:36:16.424 --> 02:36:17.726]  The economy's imploded.
[02:36:17.726 --> 02:36:18.746]  Cheapest stuff in town.
[02:36:18.746 --> 02:36:21.208]  $3,000 a month for 7,000 square feet.
[02:36:21.208 --> 02:36:22.049]  And we're signing the deal.
[02:36:22.049 --> 02:36:22.990]  We're getting it.
[02:36:22.990 --> 02:36:25.312]  But it's going to be tough for us financially.
[02:36:25.312 --> 02:36:33.098]  And with Daryl giving donations and things, I may not have to be up here so much pitching this, pitching that, because it's like a meter I got running with all these employees and TV and radio.
[02:36:34.019 --> 02:36:36.420]  Almost $30,000 of IT and bandwidth a month.
[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:37.800]  I mean, it's a lot.
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:40.141]  And as we get bigger and bigger, it becomes greater and greater.
[02:36:40.141 --> 02:36:45.422]  And Daryl found out that when Tyranny Crusher won, they had $30,000 real bids.
[02:36:45.422 --> 02:36:48.843]  But the people bragged that they put in fake bids, so it got disqualified.
[02:36:48.843 --> 02:36:52.605]  And they sent us emails saying, you will never get the $50,000.
[02:36:52.605 --> 02:36:53.185]  You will fail.
[02:36:53.185 --> 02:36:54.605]  You will never sell that bullhorn.
[02:36:54.605 --> 02:36:56.266]  Well, it's Daryl's idea.
[02:36:56.266 --> 02:36:57.446]  They failed today.
[02:36:57.446 --> 02:37:00.227]  Dale Rundis, tell folks what you decided to do.
[02:37:01.067 --> 02:37:03.469]  I mean, I just can't believe people would rip you off like that.
[02:37:03.469 --> 02:37:09.314]  I mean, I'm enraged that people would take the... They even posted it on their website with the file... Yeah, and brag about it.
[02:37:09.314 --> 02:37:11.156]  Does that tell you about the state of the world today?
[02:37:11.156 --> 02:37:19.823]  I mean, just the evil atrocities... They even posted the eBay filing with their code and their name and how they put the $5 million bid in to screw it up.
[02:37:19.963 --> 02:37:21.445]  Yeah, well, their loss is my gain.
[02:37:21.445 --> 02:37:22.327]  I guess what, Alex?
[02:37:22.327 --> 02:37:27.855]  I'm gonna, uh, I'm gonna pay you $50,000 for getting Pressure 1, man.
[02:37:27.855 --> 02:37:31.681]  I can't wait to go out on the streets with you and we'll go protest the Fed.
[02:37:31.681 --> 02:37:33.123]  Now, that got attacked by MSNBC.
[02:37:33.123 --> 02:37:34.845]  They cut the wire, but you can have it soldered to the base.
[02:37:34.845 --> 02:37:35.086]  It's right!
[02:37:35.086 --> 02:37:35.747]  You can't have it!
[02:37:36.147 --> 02:37:37.108]  No, no, no.
[02:37:37.108 --> 02:37:38.429]  Hey, Daryl, thank you so much.
[02:37:38.429 --> 02:37:41.431]  We're going to use that to finish the new TV studio.
[02:37:41.431 --> 02:37:48.656]  But also, you're encouraging folks, your original idea, until I said, why don't you just take, well, you said, turn to Christopher Wong, and you found out, would be to get people to match at the Money Bomb.
[02:37:48.656 --> 02:37:50.197]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:37:50.197 --> 02:37:53.840]  Yeah, and you know, the bottom line is, look, Alex, I was here, what, about six months ago?
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:55.902]  You showed me this new place, and you hadn't had it done yet.
[02:37:56.662 --> 02:38:01.886]  I'm honestly and genuinely amazed and I'm impressed at what you guys have accomplished with so little.
[02:38:01.886 --> 02:38:04.488]  If people knew how hard you worked, it's like Michelangelo.
[02:38:04.488 --> 02:38:11.172]  Now I'm not putting you in Michelangelo's league here, but when people were marveling at what he had done at the Sistine Chapel, you know what he said?
[02:38:11.172 --> 02:38:16.356]  He said, if people knew how hard I had to work to achieve my mastery, it would be no mystery at all.
[02:38:16.676 --> 02:38:17.917]  And that's the key to what you're doing.
[02:38:17.917 --> 02:38:19.178]  I mean, it's just hard work.
[02:38:19.178 --> 02:38:30.689]  In fact, I thank you for letting me come here today because I know there's a lot of people out there who owe the fact that they woke up to the New World Order and to these evil atrocities and things that are being committed on the common man today.
[02:38:30.689 --> 02:38:33.732]  And the ultimate question they ask themselves when they first wake up is what?
[02:38:34.532 --> 02:38:35.392]  What can I do?
[02:38:35.392 --> 02:38:36.033]  What can I do?
[02:38:36.033 --> 02:38:41.735]  And hey, it could be wearing a t-shirt, it could be buying a bullhorn, I mean, it could be anything, but do something!
[02:38:41.735 --> 02:38:47.197]  Get up, get out, speak up, don't shut up, and never give up, or your liberties are gone!
[02:38:47.197 --> 02:38:49.858]  I mean, now is the time to make a change.
[02:38:49.858 --> 02:38:51.759]  In fact, you can make a difference.
[02:38:51.759 --> 02:38:52.959]  One person can make a difference.
[02:38:52.959 --> 02:38:54.520]  Take a look at Alex and what he's doing.
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:55.720]  He's just a man.
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:57.061]  Jason Burrus, he's just a man.
[02:38:57.061 --> 02:38:58.201]  I am just a man.
[02:38:58.201 --> 02:39:00.222]  But God takes one people and he'll
[02:39:00.782 --> 02:39:13.069]  You know, duplicate him and he'll create magnificent, amazing, miraculous even, events occur if somebody's just willing of heart, they have the commitment, the dedication, the determination, and the will to carry it out.
[02:39:13.069 --> 02:39:16.711]  The perseverance that it takes to get up, suit up, show up, and never give up.
[02:39:17.808 --> 02:39:18.489]  Absolutely, Darrell.
[02:39:18.489 --> 02:39:20.590]  You're doing a lot of stuff these days.
[02:39:20.590 --> 02:39:24.633]  For folks that don't know who you are, tell us a little bit about yourself and some of the ministries you've started.
[02:39:24.633 --> 02:39:29.797]  And you're going to be launching some new alternative media things for everybody to kind of go around YouTube.
[02:39:29.797 --> 02:39:34.220]  You've also got a new thing you're doing because you're always wanting to spread the gospel.
[02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:41.045]  And even if people aren't into the gospel, they might as well know they can win quite a big prize with what you're doing there.
[02:39:41.045 --> 02:39:43.167]  Because as you said, you've sold your big business.
[02:39:43.167 --> 02:39:45.989]  Your attempt now is to wake folks up to the new world order and win souls.
[02:39:46.189 --> 02:39:46.850]  Well, exactly.
[02:39:46.850 --> 02:39:54.300]  I mean, when you boil it all down, one of my favorite, or one of your favorite analogies of mine is the, uh, who would trade their eyes for a million dollars, right?
[02:39:54.300 --> 02:39:57.584]  And if your eyes are merely the windows for your... And I always tell that wrong!
[02:39:57.584 --> 02:39:58.505]  Start over and tell it.
[02:39:58.505 --> 02:40:01.449]  Okay, well, basically I say, hey Alex, would you trade your eyes for a million bucks?
[02:40:02.270 --> 02:40:02.931]  Absolutely not.
[02:40:02.931 --> 02:40:03.731]  How about a billion?
[02:40:03.731 --> 02:40:04.071]  Never.
[02:40:04.071 --> 02:40:04.832]  Quadrillion?
[02:40:04.832 --> 02:40:05.092]  Never.
[02:40:05.092 --> 02:40:06.493]  Not all the money in the world, right?
[02:40:06.493 --> 02:40:08.394]  Your eyes are valuable, they're precious to you.
[02:40:08.394 --> 02:40:13.358]  Well, if your eyes are merely the windows for your soul to look out, then how much more should your soul be worth to you?
[02:40:13.358 --> 02:40:15.760]  There's just nothing more valuable than someone's soul.
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:17.221]  And that's what we're really in a battle for.
[02:40:17.221 --> 02:40:20.063]  This is a struggle against good, against evil.
[02:40:20.063 --> 02:40:24.746]  I would say for a billion bucks, I would give my eyes and then use the billion dollars for good.
[02:40:24.746 --> 02:40:24.926]  Right.
[02:40:25.486 --> 02:40:28.067]  But most people, would you give it for self-gain?
[02:40:28.067 --> 02:40:28.347]  No.
[02:40:28.347 --> 02:40:29.587]  No, absolutely not.
[02:40:29.587 --> 02:40:30.508]  You'd have to be insane.
[02:40:30.508 --> 02:40:34.129]  You'd have to meet a sane person who would trade their eyes for all Bill Gates' money.
[02:40:34.129 --> 02:40:37.610]  But the bottom line is, look, this is a struggle for good and evil.
[02:40:37.610 --> 02:40:38.770]  Evil is done in darkness.
[02:40:38.770 --> 02:40:39.990]  The truth is brought into the light.
[02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:42.651]  Every day, you're here, under the lights, out into the public.
[02:40:42.651 --> 02:40:44.272]  Look at Bilderberg, everything is in secret.
[02:40:44.272 --> 02:40:46.152]  That's right, exactly, because they have things to hide.
[02:40:46.152 --> 02:40:48.133]  If you don't have anything to hide, you'll bring it into the light.
[02:40:48.493 --> 02:40:55.519]  So we want to expose people, and the cornerstone to a free society is a free and independent press.
[02:40:55.519 --> 02:40:58.622]  Without a free and independent press, we don't have a free society.
[02:40:58.622 --> 02:41:01.465]  So we're doing something that's going to give people a chance to make a difference.
[02:41:01.465 --> 02:41:12.635]  People ask themselves all the time, in fact, just last month, I'm in LA, I'm having breakfast with a very well-known Christian celebrity, and I'm sharing with them some of the things I've learned and some of the things I've woke up to about the Fed.
[02:41:13.355 --> 02:41:14.696]  He just had the recent big hit movie.
[02:41:14.696 --> 02:41:15.317]  We won't say his name.
[02:41:15.317 --> 02:41:15.697]  Right, right.
[02:41:15.697 --> 02:41:16.217]  Big hit movie.
[02:41:16.217 --> 02:41:18.359]  I don't want to bring up his name and do any name dropping.
[02:41:18.359 --> 02:41:20.480]  I know a lot of different people in a lot of high places.
[02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:22.101]  Anyway, so you're out there and what happens?
[02:41:22.101 --> 02:41:29.846]  So, you know, when you're a millionaire, right, and you're successful and you've ran several successful businesses, people inevitably ask you questions about what do you think about the bailout?
[02:41:29.846 --> 02:41:30.787]  What do you think about the bankers?
[02:41:30.787 --> 02:41:31.808]  What do you think about the economy?
[02:41:32.248 --> 02:41:33.428]  So, one thing leads to another.
[02:41:33.428 --> 02:41:36.069]  Of course, I didn't start off with, hey, 9-11's an inside job.
[02:41:36.069 --> 02:41:37.270]  They would have thought I was a kook, right?
[02:41:37.270 --> 02:41:44.512]  So, you start in the natural, you swing to some of these things, these harder truths that it's hard for people to comprehend because it is so evil.
[02:41:44.512 --> 02:41:46.152]  It is so atrocious.
[02:41:46.152 --> 02:41:48.113]  You think, well, how could our government be so wicked?
[02:41:48.113 --> 02:41:48.893]  How could they be so evil?
[02:41:48.893 --> 02:41:57.416]  So, slowly but surely, I incrementally increased the amount of knowledge I'm giving this guy, and I knew he woke up because he asked the question we all ask when we first wake up, what can I do?
[02:41:57.976 --> 02:41:58.937]  What can I do?
[02:41:58.937 --> 02:42:02.359]  And I said, well the first thing you can do is provide and protect your own family.
[02:42:02.359 --> 02:42:04.160]  That's your first responsibility under God.
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:05.020]  Am I wrong though?
[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:06.841]  And then, wake other people up!
[02:42:06.841 --> 02:42:07.482]  Do something!
[02:42:07.482 --> 02:42:08.322]  You don't care what it is.
[02:42:08.322 --> 02:42:11.564]  Use your celebrity, use your television show, whatever it is.
[02:42:11.564 --> 02:42:12.945]  Start sowing the seed.
[02:42:12.945 --> 02:42:17.488]  And you know and I know, Alex, it's not about winning them or waking them up, right?
[02:42:17.488 --> 02:42:19.569]  It's also just about sowing that seed.
[02:42:19.569 --> 02:42:21.590]  And what they do with that knowledge is up to them after that.
[02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:22.691]  You don't have to wake them up.
[02:42:22.691 --> 02:42:23.972]  It's not your job to wake them up.
[02:42:23.972 --> 02:42:24.892]  It's your job to speak.
[02:42:24.892 --> 02:42:25.853]  It's your job to warn them.
[02:42:25.933 --> 02:42:26.293]  That's it.
[02:42:26.293 --> 02:42:28.715]  You warn them, you wake them up, you know, you talk to them.
[02:42:28.715 --> 02:42:30.217]  Yeah, we're on the walls of the city.
[02:42:30.217 --> 02:42:32.939]  The enemy's pouring towards the gates and we're saying, hey, they're here.
[02:42:32.939 --> 02:42:36.703]  And if folks want to be idiots and not rise up and protect themselves, that's their issue.
[02:42:36.703 --> 02:42:36.963]  That's right.
[02:42:36.963 --> 02:42:42.928]  If they want to continue to let CDC come and take their kids, if they want to continue to inject their kids with poison that's going to kill them, so be it.
[02:42:42.928 --> 02:42:43.569]  But it's my job.
[02:42:43.569 --> 02:42:44.670]  I mean, I got to thinking about this.
[02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:46.111]  My wife and I last night were talking about
[02:42:46.551 --> 02:42:56.580]  How much would you have to hate somebody not to warn them that they're inadvertently or unwittingly killing their kids by injecting them or allowing the state to inject them with poisonous vaccine?
[02:42:56.580 --> 02:43:01.544]  And it's a state that's been caught doing thousands and thousands of lethal tests on children and people.
[02:43:02.285 --> 02:43:04.426]  I mean, these folks do it over and over again.
[02:43:04.426 --> 02:43:06.346]  Well, we should trust them this time.
[02:43:06.346 --> 02:43:08.547]  And then the HPV shots killing all these girls?
[02:43:08.547 --> 02:43:10.087]  I mean, it's just one thing after another.
[02:43:10.087 --> 02:43:10.887]  You report on it all day.
[02:43:10.887 --> 02:43:12.467]  I mean, look at this stack of information.
[02:43:12.467 --> 02:43:13.328]  That's just the last few days.
[02:43:13.328 --> 02:43:14.548]  That's just the last few days.
[02:43:14.548 --> 02:43:17.869]  So, I mean, how much would you... Look at this Irish priest beat, rape, children report.
[02:43:17.869 --> 02:43:21.530]  I've got this stuff about CPS in Ireland that's run by the Catholics.
[02:43:21.530 --> 02:43:22.790]  Mass raping.
[02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:23.330]  Guys that are...
[02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:28.557]  In Texas, hundreds and hundreds of the CPS are convicted criminals and pedophiles.
[02:43:28.557 --> 02:43:30.159]  That was in AP yesterday.
[02:43:30.159 --> 02:43:34.705]  I never even got to it on air while I was exposing the Child Protective Services.
[02:43:34.705 --> 02:43:36.147]  They're pedophiles!
[02:43:36.147 --> 02:43:38.811]  We all, finally, when we wake up, we ask ourselves, what can we do?
[02:43:39.011 --> 02:43:42.954]  And there's a lot of people who call you on air all the time and say, Alex, you need to do this, and Alex, you need to do that.
[02:43:42.954 --> 02:43:46.117]  Man, this one man, let me tell you, world, you listen, you listen good.
[02:43:46.117 --> 02:43:49.560]  This one man's doing more than a thousand of you combined already, okay?
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:51.222]  So don't keep laying burdens back on him.
[02:43:51.222 --> 02:43:52.823]  And he didn't know I was going to even say these things.
[02:43:54.704 --> 02:43:57.306]  I know there are people out there, they say, Oh, Ox, you've got to do this now.
[02:43:57.306 --> 02:43:58.307]  And that's great, but you know what?
[02:43:58.307 --> 02:43:59.928]  Maybe God gave them that idea.
[02:43:59.928 --> 02:44:04.110]  Maybe they need to take that idea and run with it and get up and go out and go do something with it.
[02:44:04.110 --> 02:44:06.472]  You're doing what God's called you to do, okay?
[02:44:06.472 --> 02:44:07.993]  You're the watchman on the wall.
[02:44:07.993 --> 02:44:11.935]  You're the point on the tip of the spear that's going to be the dagger in the heart of the new world.
[02:44:11.935 --> 02:44:12.796]  I don't know about that.
[02:44:12.796 --> 02:44:13.596]  Okay?
[02:44:13.596 --> 02:44:15.057]  We wanted to give people a platform.
[02:44:15.057 --> 02:44:16.538]  A big black heart's full of acid.
[02:44:16.538 --> 02:44:18.299]  That might be painful with the dagger going in there.
[02:44:18.479 --> 02:44:21.140]  Well, you know, like you, dude, I'm tenacious.
[02:44:21.140 --> 02:44:22.121]  And I like to make a difference.
[02:44:22.121 --> 02:44:25.442]  I'm not one who wants to sit on the sidelines satisfied in my own success.
[02:44:25.442 --> 02:44:29.564]  I want to take what God's given me and I want to use it to be a blessing to other people and to wake other people up.
[02:44:29.564 --> 02:44:34.926]  And I couldn't think, as you know, I've talked to you, I've talked to Ted Anderson, I've talked to a lot of people about maybe doing a radio show.
[02:44:34.926 --> 02:44:35.866]  I think you should!
[02:44:35.866 --> 02:44:38.667]  Well, and that may be, but I wanted to do something bigger.
[02:44:38.667 --> 02:44:42.229]  I don't think, Small, you know me, Alex, I'm 6'4", they just call me Rundasaurus.
[02:44:42.229 --> 02:44:44.450]  You may be the T-Rex, you can call me Rundasaurus.
[02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:50.373]  No, but I've told you, that's what everybody you set up with yours has told you, because you started some media companies and other things.
[02:44:50.373 --> 02:44:57.876]  You need to get on the radio, and I know... This, what I'm about to tell you, what I'm about to unleash on the public right now, okay, this is something that the world needs.
[02:44:57.876 --> 02:45:03.719]  See, once again, the cornerstone to a free and independent country is a free and independent press, but we don't have one.
[02:45:03.999 --> 02:45:05.120]  You know that and I know that.
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:14.164]  Now let me tell you folks, if you're tired of being told the same propaganda over and over, parodied the same five or six stories a day by all the mainstream media, you're going to love this, okay?
[02:45:14.164 --> 02:45:17.045]  If you want to take control and you ask yourself, what can I do?
[02:45:17.045 --> 02:45:17.966]  You know what you can do?
[02:45:17.966 --> 02:45:19.366]  You can do news, okay?
[02:45:19.366 --> 02:45:23.008]  The power to change the world, I don't know if I'm on camera here, is right here in the palm of your hand.
[02:45:23.008 --> 02:45:24.569]  There you are, you're on TV right now.
[02:45:24.569 --> 02:45:25.669]  It's in the palm of your hand.
[02:45:25.669 --> 02:45:28.731]  Pick up a camera, get up, go out and start reporting things.
[02:45:29.071 --> 02:45:35.619]  We're going to unleash a new website, a lot like YouTube, without the clutter, without the fluff, without the craziness.
[02:45:35.619 --> 02:45:40.764]  A true, independent, journalistic website where people can upload their news stories, okay?
[02:45:40.764 --> 02:45:43.688]  And that could be anything from local news, to weather, to sports, to business.
[02:45:44.208 --> 02:45:47.830]  One thing I would encourage people to do is what I call TV News Review.
[02:45:47.830 --> 02:45:59.997]  You know, go watch the Glenn Beck Show, go watch the O'Reilly Factor, go watch CNBC and CNN and all those, and then a week later, make commentary on these comments these liars are telling you, and expose them for the liars that they really are.
[02:45:59.997 --> 02:46:03.959]  Yeah, in fact, you've always had that idea, and I've had that separately, and I need to do that.
[02:46:03.959 --> 02:46:05.100]  That's my next calling.
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:05.900]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:25.874 --> 02:46:26.875]  You do news.
[02:46:26.875 --> 02:46:28.096]  What can you do?
[02:46:28.096 --> 02:46:28.937]  You can do news.
[02:46:28.937 --> 02:46:34.682]  You can get up, go out, start reporting these cops that are harassing people or robbing people of their civil rights.
[02:46:34.682 --> 02:46:37.605]  Hey, the week before Christmas, here's a classic example.
[02:46:37.605 --> 02:46:39.186]  We're out sharing the gospel, okay?
[02:46:39.186 --> 02:46:41.629]  Just passing out million-dollar bills, okay?
[02:46:41.629 --> 02:46:42.189]  No big deal.
[02:46:42.189 --> 02:46:42.850]  Everybody loves them.
[02:46:42.850 --> 02:46:44.711]  Telling people the real reason for the season.
[02:46:44.711 --> 02:46:50.377]  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, two dark police cops were in West End Marketplace, tackle a guy
[02:46:50.797 --> 02:46:57.179]  Okay, arrest him, throw him in cuffs, beat him up, throw him in the back of the squad car and charge him with public intoxication.
[02:46:57.179 --> 02:46:58.600]  Now this guy's a Christian.
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:02.001]  He's not drinking, he's out there... And he's handing out gospel tracts.
[02:47:02.001 --> 02:47:03.661]  That's it, but they didn't want us out there.
[02:47:03.661 --> 02:47:10.424]  The week after that, the real week before Christmas, they almost threw me and my daughter and a few others in jail for doing the same thing.
[02:47:10.424 --> 02:47:19.647]  Come to find out, I did a little research, almost a year to the day earlier, the chief of police from DART and the CEO of DART had sent out a memo to all the officers saying,
[02:47:20.027 --> 02:47:24.909]  They have every right to be on that public sidewalk and even on the public train passing out those Gospels.
[02:47:24.909 --> 02:47:31.010]  I know, why would the police break the orders of their commanders and the Constitution and do that?
[02:47:31.010 --> 02:47:37.833]  Because they're, hey, they're, lick my boots boy, lick my boots man, they're all fluorided up and on steroids man, what do you expect?
[02:47:37.833 --> 02:47:42.534]  Now not all officers are bad, you know, I pray for police officers every day, I pray God will protect this
[02:47:42.534 --> 02:47:43.535]  No, you're a really nice guy.
[02:47:43.535 --> 02:47:43.976]  I've seen it.
[02:47:43.976 --> 02:47:47.560]  But all over Dallas, the cops come up and tell you on city sidewalks.
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:48.661]  You can't be there.
[02:47:48.661 --> 02:47:50.863]  Show the camera those little flyers you give out.
[02:47:50.863 --> 02:47:52.065]  Well, like these, you know.
[02:47:52.065 --> 02:47:54.708]  Hey, by the way, I brought you a big donation.
[02:47:54.708 --> 02:47:55.749]  Can you break a big bill?
[02:47:55.749 --> 02:48:04.098]  So, I mean, these are ways that, you know, and even if folks hate Christians out there and they've got a problem, it's your right to go out and have a First Amendment.
[02:48:04.238 --> 02:48:09.964]  In fact, we got a case against the State Fair of Texas right now because they kicked us off the fairgrounds and said we couldn't be there even though it's owned by Fair Park.
[02:48:09.964 --> 02:48:12.186]  And then you couldn't be out, they said, on the sidewalk in front of it.
[02:48:12.186 --> 02:48:15.650]  They even threatened to arrest us for criminal trespassing for being out there.
[02:48:15.650 --> 02:48:20.295]  Now they conceded to that, but we're still in this court case, so I can't say a whole lot about it because it's coming up.
[02:48:20.295 --> 02:48:21.676]  But what I can say is that
[02:48:22.837 --> 02:48:23.778]  They asked me a question.
[02:48:23.778 --> 02:48:28.562]  They said, Daryl, how would you feel if a bunch of gays and lesbians were marching down with the pink police and doing that?
[02:48:28.562 --> 02:48:30.224]  I mean, if we let you do it, we've got to let everybody do it.
[02:48:30.224 --> 02:48:31.385]  I said, well, praise God!
[02:48:31.385 --> 02:48:32.986]  Isn't that what the Constitution's all about?
[02:48:32.986 --> 02:48:33.447]  Free speech?
[02:48:33.447 --> 02:48:36.690]  Look, I may not agree with your opinion, but you're entitled to it.
[02:48:36.690 --> 02:48:41.254]  And you have every right and every civil liberty under the Constitution of the United States.
[02:48:41.254 --> 02:48:43.315]  Plus, under this system, they're going to be allowed to march.
[02:48:43.315 --> 02:48:43.716]  You're not.
[02:48:44.016 --> 02:48:44.837]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:48:44.837 --> 02:48:45.857]  They're selective.
[02:48:45.857 --> 02:48:50.721]  You know, we can't profile people at the airport, but we can single out, you know, Christians or conservatives.
[02:48:50.721 --> 02:48:51.382]  Ron Paul conservatives.
[02:48:51.382 --> 02:48:56.586]  Ron Paul people, or people that believe in, or they're pro-life instead of pro... Yeah, they're all on the list.
[02:48:56.586 --> 02:48:58.007]  Yeah, we're on the list, they're not.
[02:48:58.007 --> 02:48:58.847]  Exactly.
[02:48:58.847 --> 02:49:04.011]  And so, look, we need to give people a platform to start speaking the truth to power, alright?
[02:49:04.011 --> 02:49:11.277]  So if they're a little guy or they're a big guy, you live in a little city or a big city, in 60 days from today, we're going beta with our site, YouDoNews.
[02:49:11.277 --> 02:49:13.699]  And this is for serious... Tell folks the web address.
[02:49:13.959 --> 02:49:16.742]  You, the letter U, D-O, News.
[02:49:16.742 --> 02:49:17.202]  YouDoNews.com.
[02:49:17.202 --> 02:49:18.944]  Man, how much did you have to pay for that domain?
[02:49:18.944 --> 02:49:21.467]  Got it for the normal price, you know, $9.95 a year.
[02:49:21.467 --> 02:49:22.508]  Nobody thought to get that?
[02:49:22.508 --> 02:49:23.569]  Hey man, it's a gift from God.
[02:49:23.569 --> 02:49:24.610]  What's the full address?
[02:49:24.610 --> 02:49:26.733]  YouDoNews.com.
[02:49:27.597 --> 02:49:30.080]  That is the most unbelievably good address I've ever heard.
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:38.111]  Well, you know, the great thing about it, Alex, is not only is this going to give a platform for people to speak the truth to power, but people are tired of the same old stories from the mainstream media.
[02:49:38.111 --> 02:49:40.475]  My vision is to ultimately create a platform.
[02:49:40.475 --> 02:49:44.120]  But Darrell, Darrell, if I alone start linking to that, you're talking thousands a day in bandwidth.
[02:49:44.580 --> 02:49:52.727]  Get this, okay, not only will I be paying for that bandwidth on our servers instead of you having to do it, you'll never have to worry about YouTube pulling your channel again because we believe in the freedom of the speech.
[02:49:52.727 --> 02:49:54.248]  We believe in the freedom of the press.
[02:49:54.248 --> 02:50:06.298]  We want to create a cornerstone for a free and independent society, and the only way that's going to happen is if you and me and other people get up and get out and start putting people to the test, asking questions of Obama, not about his dog.
[02:50:06.298 --> 02:50:08.700]  Hey, how do you like your new dog, Mr. Obama?
[02:50:08.700 --> 02:50:09.300]  Isn't he cute?
[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:09.901]  Isn't he lovely?
[02:50:09.901 --> 02:50:11.142]  Oh, I hear he can't swim!
[02:50:11.142 --> 02:50:12.363]  Why don't you ask about
[02:50:12.523 --> 02:50:15.825]  Why don't you ask about where all the money went on the bailout?
[02:50:15.825 --> 02:50:18.746]  Where did the trillions of dollars that they just stole from us?
[02:50:18.746 --> 02:50:23.909]  By the way, Daryl, speaking of lying, Obama, I never thought it could be taken to a new level.
[02:50:23.909 --> 02:50:28.371]  He's taken it to a new level, where he'll say he's ending torture, but he's expanding it.
[02:50:28.371 --> 02:50:33.094]  He'll say he's fighting CEO bonuses from bailout money, and he does the orders to do it.
[02:50:33.094 --> 02:50:35.255]  The guy is good, man.
[02:50:35.255 --> 02:50:36.435]  He's the master manipulator.
[02:50:36.435 --> 02:50:37.536]  You can't believe a word he's saying.
[02:50:37.536 --> 02:50:38.736]  You know how you know he's lying?
[02:50:38.736 --> 02:50:39.377]  His lips are moving.
[02:50:40.037 --> 02:50:41.557]  Yeah, but I thought that was Bill Clinton.
[02:50:41.557 --> 02:50:43.318]  This guy is just... He's the best.
[02:50:43.318 --> 02:50:44.678]  He's the best I've ever seen.
[02:50:44.678 --> 02:50:45.338]  No two ways about it.
[02:50:45.338 --> 02:50:46.679]  And that's why we've got to be on guard.
[02:50:46.679 --> 02:50:47.919]  That's why we've got to get in power.
[02:50:47.919 --> 02:50:51.740]  We've got to pick up the power that's in the palm of our hand and take it to the people.
[02:50:51.740 --> 02:50:55.281]  Upload it at YouDoNews.com 60 days from today.
[02:50:55.281 --> 02:50:57.401]  Well done, Lord Randis.
[02:50:57.401 --> 02:50:58.221]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:58.221 --> 02:50:59.582]  Stay with us at 4Wars.com.
[02:51:01.616 --> 02:51:05.038]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:51:05.038 --> 02:51:09.301]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:51:09.301 --> 02:51:20.968]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:51:20.968 --> 02:51:26.792]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:51:27.032 --> 02:51:27.673]  We're good to go.
[02:51:55.582 --> 02:52:02.846]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:02.846 --> 02:52:08.209]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[02:52:08.209 --> 02:52:10.630]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.

[02:52:19.275 --> 02:52:19.695]  We're good to go.
[02:52:49.318 --> 02:52:49.579]  We're good.
[02:53:01.355 --> 02:53:04.858]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:53:04.858 --> 02:53:06.779]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:53:06.779 --> 02:53:12.343]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:53:12.343 --> 02:53:20.368]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[02:53:29.955 --> 02:53:33.159]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.

[02:54:05.382 --> 02:54:11.084]  Okay, for the next 20 minutes, the next hour, we're going to talk to Kurt, Catalina, Jeff, David, Jake, with Daryl Rundison's studio.
[02:54:11.084 --> 02:54:12.985]  They can talk about all these issues.
[02:54:12.985 --> 02:54:21.428]  The next five minutes, though, we're going to finish up with something else Daryl's doing, another exciting idea of reaching out to people and tell folks about it.
[02:54:21.428 --> 02:54:23.428]  In fact, you know me, I'm a silver and gold bug.
[02:54:23.428 --> 02:54:23.649]  Yeah.
[02:54:23.649 --> 02:54:24.449]  Let me have that.
[02:54:24.449 --> 02:54:24.889]  Let me see that.
[02:54:25.169 --> 02:54:26.590]  Well, let me present it to you properly.
[02:54:26.590 --> 02:54:27.750]  Well, no, I just want to show people.
[02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:28.831]  You've got to show people.
[02:54:28.831 --> 02:54:29.871]  Okay, but what is it?
[02:54:29.871 --> 02:54:31.812]  It's a pure one-ounce silver bar.
[02:54:31.812 --> 02:54:32.432]  Zoom in over here.
[02:54:32.432 --> 02:54:33.973]  It has the Ten Commandments on it.
[02:54:33.973 --> 02:54:36.114]  Now, I don't care if you're a Christian or an atheist or what.
[02:54:36.114 --> 02:54:36.855]  I don't really care.
[02:54:36.855 --> 02:54:40.516]  But look, if we're going to get back to basics, Alex, there's nothing more fundamental.
[02:54:40.516 --> 02:54:41.437]  No more basic.
[02:54:41.437 --> 02:54:43.838]  In fact, our whole society's laws were based on what law?
[02:54:44.518 --> 02:54:49.822]  Yeah, don't murder people, don't lie, don't cheat, don't kill, don't steal, and so on.
[02:54:49.822 --> 02:54:58.628]  And if we would start to hold ourselves accountable to that standard, especially the Christians, then maybe we'd start to hold other people, like these plunderers.
[02:54:58.628 --> 02:55:04.652]  Quit coveting our property, quit coveting our resources, quit lying, quit stealing our money, quit overtaxing us, and so on.
[02:55:04.652 --> 02:55:06.614]  You've created this one-ounce fine.
[02:55:06.614 --> 02:55:07.554]  Here, show it to them again.
[02:55:07.554 --> 02:55:10.857]  Yeah, it's a one-ounce silver bar that has the Ten Commandments on it, but that's not what we're doing.
[02:55:11.477 --> 02:55:13.398]  Was it ingenually intrigued, Alex?
[02:55:13.398 --> 02:55:18.919]  Believe it or not, I went out and asked thousands of different people who claim to believe in God if they could name the Ten Commandments.
[02:55:18.919 --> 02:55:24.021]  Now, they could name ten sports teams, they could name ten beers, they could name ten celebrities, okay?
[02:55:24.021 --> 02:55:27.102]  But when I asked them to name the Ten Commandments, you know how many people could do it?
[02:55:27.102 --> 02:55:29.142]  About five percent, okay?
[02:55:29.142 --> 02:55:35.364]  So, I wanted to give people an awesome incentive to learn the law of life and of liberty that's already written on their hearts.
[02:55:35.364 --> 02:55:37.525]  So, I'm giving away twenty thousand dollars
[02:55:37.945 --> 02:55:40.968]  To anybody who can list the law in order and do it in 20 seconds.
[02:55:54.042 --> 02:56:00.966]  We put a two-minute video up on the site called Learn the Law, and we made it so simple for you to learn how to do it, my eight-year-old can do it.
[02:56:00.966 --> 02:56:03.048]  So we did a video of her, you know.
[02:56:03.048 --> 02:56:04.469]  But how do they win it online?
[02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.849]  I don't understand.
[02:56:04.849 --> 02:56:07.530]  Well, what it's going to be is you go through the registration process.
[02:56:07.530 --> 02:56:10.732]  There's a site coming up there, and you get a little intro video.
[02:56:10.732 --> 02:56:14.555]  It tells you a little bit about why this crazy guy's giving 20 grand away for you to list the law.
[02:56:14.555 --> 02:56:19.598]  Once you go through the registration process, and I think it's October 28th, somewhere around the end of October,
[02:56:20.058 --> 02:56:21.939]  We are going to get on the phone live.
[02:56:21.939 --> 02:56:24.061]  Maybe we can do it on your show or do it on somebody else's.
[02:56:24.061 --> 02:56:25.001]  That's fine.
[02:56:25.001 --> 02:56:25.962]  What we'll do is get on the phone.
[02:56:25.962 --> 02:56:34.127]  The first one, I get on the phone who can name all 10 commandments in order in 20 seconds or less as we randomly draw the names of those who registered.
[02:56:34.127 --> 02:56:35.188]  We're going to give them $20,000.
[02:56:35.188 --> 02:56:35.748]  It's that simple.
[02:56:35.748 --> 02:56:37.209]  There's no ads on the site.
[02:56:37.209 --> 02:56:39.330]  I'm not selling you some scam wow.
[02:56:39.330 --> 02:56:41.272]  I'm not going to put you on some mailing list.
[02:56:41.272 --> 02:56:42.472]  This is just the real deal.
[02:56:42.472 --> 02:56:43.973]  I mean, I got more dollars than cents.
[02:56:43.973 --> 02:56:49.497]  Yeah, Daryl comes out to big public events with giant piles of silver dollars that people can answer questions and give some answers.
[02:56:49.517 --> 02:56:51.738]  Yeah, I caught questions for cash and stuff.
[02:56:51.738 --> 02:56:54.959]  Just like the New World Order controls things through money, they don't really care about money.
[02:56:54.959 --> 02:56:56.160]  They want souls.
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:56:57.261]  That's what you want on the other side.
[02:56:57.261 --> 02:56:58.221]  That's right.
[02:56:58.221 --> 02:57:00.162]  Because control of the minds of men is everything.
[02:57:00.162 --> 02:57:01.202]  We want to free them.
[02:57:01.202 --> 02:57:03.803]  They want to control them.
[02:57:03.803 --> 02:57:05.324]  So how many winners can you have originally?
[02:57:05.324 --> 02:57:07.045]  We're going to have one winner at the end of the contest.
[02:57:07.045 --> 02:57:08.886]  As many people as you want can register.
[02:57:08.886 --> 02:57:10.807]  You, your wife, as many people as you want.
[02:57:10.807 --> 02:57:11.527]  So it's whoever can do it the best.
[02:57:11.727 --> 02:57:12.268]  No, no, no.
[02:57:12.268 --> 02:57:14.510]  What we're going to do, whether you can do it or not, doesn't matter.
[02:57:14.510 --> 02:57:16.712]  Go to TenAndWin.com and register.
[02:57:16.712 --> 02:57:18.894]  Then watch the Learn the Law video.
[02:57:18.894 --> 02:57:20.195]  It's a two-minute video.
[02:57:20.195 --> 02:57:22.597]  In fact, let me just teach you on air real quick the Ten Commandments in order.
[02:57:22.597 --> 02:57:23.458]  Are you ready?
[02:57:23.458 --> 02:57:24.038]  Bar your fingers.
[02:57:24.038 --> 02:57:26.581]  Put that down for a second.
[02:57:26.581 --> 02:57:27.942]  Number one, put God first.
[02:57:27.942 --> 02:57:30.224]  Number two, don't bow down to idols.
[02:57:30.224 --> 02:57:32.506]  Number three, don't take God's name in vain.
[02:57:32.506 --> 02:57:34.187]  Number four, all these people are going somewhere.
[02:57:34.187 --> 02:57:34.628]  Where are they going?
[02:57:34.628 --> 02:57:37.470]  They're going to church because they're honoring the Sabbath day and they're keeping it holy.
[02:57:38.863 --> 02:57:39.143]  I think so.
[02:57:59.414 --> 02:58:00.335]  We're good to go.
[02:58:20.606 --> 02:58:22.187]  But how do I get one of these Ten Commandments?
[02:58:22.187 --> 02:58:22.767]  It's yours.
[02:58:22.767 --> 02:58:24.388]  No, but how do folks get one of these?
[02:58:24.388 --> 02:58:25.589]  Oh, well, I don't know.
[02:58:25.589 --> 02:58:26.289]  I just give them away.
[02:58:26.289 --> 02:58:26.910]  I don't sell them.
[02:58:26.910 --> 02:58:29.891]  You know me, like I said, I got more dollars than... We need to talk to Ted Anderson.
[02:58:29.891 --> 02:58:31.512]  We can get a lot of these out to people.
[02:58:31.512 --> 02:58:32.913]  I'm a big capitalist.
[02:58:32.913 --> 02:58:37.235]  I'm telling you, I'm addicted to silver and gold.
[02:58:37.235 --> 02:58:39.336]  I'm kind of even a little pot belly dragon.
[02:58:39.336 --> 02:58:39.957]  Here it is, folks.
[02:58:39.957 --> 02:58:40.517]  Stay with us.
[02:58:40.517 --> 02:58:47.141]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.141 --> 02:58:49.122]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.391 --> 02:58:53.074]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.074 --> 02:58:57.821]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.821 --> 02:59:00.786]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.786 --> 02:59:02.068]  You'll never have to stand in a bread
[02:59:05.533 --> 02:59:05.974]  I'm good.
[02:59:21.806 --> 02:59:22.306]  We're good to go.
[02:59:54.122 --> 02:59:56.484]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:59:56.484 --> 03:00:04.469]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:13.115]  We've got Darryl Rondas for another 20 minutes or so where this is going to be taking your phone calls.
[03:00:13.115 --> 03:00:14.936]  Let's just go ahead and go to those now.
[03:00:14.936 --> 03:00:17.217]  Kurt in Ohio, you're on the air with Alex Jones and Darryl Rondas.
[03:00:17.217 --> 03:00:21.040]  Go ahead.
[03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:21.960]  Hello, Kurt.
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:22.501]  Come on down.
[03:00:24.485 --> 03:00:25.006]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:00:25.006 --> 03:00:26.248]  How are you doing?
[03:00:26.248 --> 03:00:27.210]  Good.
[03:00:27.210 --> 03:00:30.795]  I brought this up to Jason the other day.
[03:00:30.795 --> 03:00:37.025]  My nine-year-old daughter has to go through anger management classes the whole class.
[03:00:37.902 --> 03:00:38.802]  I don't know.
[03:00:54.147 --> 03:00:56.790]  They had this in the Soviet Union and they admit that's what it is.
[03:00:56.790 --> 03:00:58.091]  This is re-education.
[03:00:58.091 --> 03:01:00.073]  This is political brainwashing.
[03:01:00.073 --> 03:01:08.060]  This is going to teach them to notice their sexual difference or to notice their racial difference and to be obsessed with it and report it and tattle.
[03:01:08.060 --> 03:01:12.284]  And the Boy Scouts are being trained to tattle on their parents in England, the U.S., Europe.
[03:01:12.284 --> 03:01:13.906]  They're being trained to spy on their neighbors.
[03:01:13.906 --> 03:01:16.488]  They're being trained to take on veterans and confiscate guns.
[03:01:16.488 --> 03:01:17.769]  This is mainstream news.
[03:01:18.550 --> 03:01:20.811]  And yes, I mean, the government's not playing games.
[03:01:20.811 --> 03:01:22.752]  They know they're losing the people.
[03:01:22.752 --> 03:01:25.694]  And so they're coming in to take over the youth.
[03:01:25.694 --> 03:01:31.997]  And the New York Times brags, and I've had parents call me en masse, you know, their kids come home and say, you can't take a bath anymore.
[03:01:31.997 --> 03:01:33.058]  That's bad for the environment.
[03:01:33.058 --> 03:01:34.579]  Hey, mom, that light bulb's wrong.
[03:01:34.579 --> 03:01:36.140]  And then you're supposed to encourage them.
[03:01:36.140 --> 03:01:37.660]  Oh, good, you tattled on me.
[03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:41.062]  Then once it's set to do it for the environment, they then bait and switch.
[03:01:41.062 --> 03:01:42.063]  And by the way, what are the guns?
[03:01:42.463 --> 03:01:45.584]  So, so, so, see, they prime it with something that sounds popular.
[03:01:45.584 --> 03:01:50.345]  Oh, they're just tattling and reporting on you for the environment, but now it's going to be for everything.
[03:01:50.345 --> 03:01:55.326]  And folks, you know, there's only a few degrees between liberty and tyranny, okay?
[03:01:55.326 --> 03:02:09.470]  And once they have warrantless wiretapping and indefinite detention and can take your guns because you're on a secret list and they're training your kids to spy on you, it's one more degree and you're mass death camps in black uniforms and marching because scum gets into government, evil gets into government, and it's its nature.
[03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:13.012]  Even when Stalin had total control of Russia, no one was resisting him.
[03:02:13.012 --> 03:02:15.233]  He said, kill 20 million people.
[03:02:15.233 --> 03:02:17.955]  You know, Lenin, when they were taking over Ukraine, they said there's no one resisting us.
[03:02:17.955 --> 03:02:18.835]  They said, I don't care.
[03:02:18.835 --> 03:02:19.516]  Continue to kill.
[03:02:19.516 --> 03:02:20.516]  I want terror.
[03:02:20.516 --> 03:02:21.077]  More blood.
[03:02:22.113 --> 03:02:27.937]  And he wrote bizarre poetry, that's public poetry about, I want to destroy the earth, destroy the sun, a great blackness.
[03:02:27.937 --> 03:02:36.983]  He would go to a little island with all these white rabbits, and they kind of put that in a Clint Eastwood movie, off of that story, and when the guy opens the trunk up and there's white rabbits and he's shotgunning them, crazy.
[03:02:36.983 --> 03:02:41.686]  Lennon would go and just rip white rabbits apart and roll around for hours, just convulsing.
[03:02:41.686 --> 03:02:42.427]  Darryl Rundus.
[03:02:42.427 --> 03:02:46.469]  Well, I'll just tell you what, Alex, this is another good reason why we need to do a You Do News.
[03:02:46.469 --> 03:02:49.932]  I mean, take this guy, he has his, what is it, his daughter or his son, I can't remember,
[03:02:51.052 --> 03:02:52.673]  What a great story for him to report on.
[03:02:52.673 --> 03:02:58.636]  He can sit there and interview his daughter and then upload it to You Do News, which is going to ultimately take the place of the mainstream media.
[03:02:58.636 --> 03:03:01.338]  Because people are fed up with the lies that are being told by the mainstream media.
[03:03:01.338 --> 03:03:05.180]  Look, I owned the world's largest newspaper circulation sales and marketing firm.
[03:03:05.180 --> 03:03:10.863]  I've worked with all the biggest newspapers from the New York Times, the LA Times, and they're all in it for the money.
[03:03:10.863 --> 03:03:11.463]  Period.
[03:03:11.463 --> 03:03:16.726]  I've seen stories thrown on the ground that need to make the front page, but they don't because they're not sensational enough.
[03:03:16.726 --> 03:03:18.027]  So the bottom line is simply this.
[03:03:18.678 --> 03:03:22.740]  We need to empower people, and one good thing they can do is to bring light into darkness.
[03:03:22.740 --> 03:03:25.181]  Hey, how much darkness can absorb the light?
[03:03:25.181 --> 03:03:26.181]  None, right?
[03:03:26.181 --> 03:03:38.767]  Light always beats the darkness, and when we expose light, when we start reporting stories like this one, this guy just called in, and upload it to a YouDo News website where people can be informed, people can be woken up to the truth and to the reality.
[03:03:38.767 --> 03:03:39.507]  Absolutely.
[03:03:39.507 --> 03:03:40.788]  Kurt, going back to you, you still there?
[03:03:40.788 --> 03:03:43.108]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[03:03:43.108 --> 03:03:43.989]  What else?
[03:03:43.989 --> 03:03:45.690]  I mean, yes, I'm aware of what you're saying.
[03:03:47.253 --> 03:03:47.873]  Go ahead.
[03:03:47.873 --> 03:04:10.241]  I think not only am I going to interview my daughter, like your guest said, I'm actually, I have a interview, or not an interview, but an appointment with her teacher, and I'm also in the process of trying to get the local school board here to get back in touch with me, because like you had mentioned, the Soviet-style schooling, I had read Charlotte Izzard Beach coming down of America,
[03:04:10.669 --> 03:04:15.993]  And after I read that, and then this was put in front of my face, I knew exactly what I was confronting.
[03:04:15.993 --> 03:04:21.897]  Yeah, and first it starts with... First it starts with sensitivity training, then it's, are your parents being mean to you?
[03:04:21.897 --> 03:04:23.358]  I mean, it's like this little girl in the office.
[03:04:23.358 --> 03:04:30.623]  They called all the kids into the computer lab, took them one and after the other, would look at their legs, say, is mommy mean to you?
[03:04:30.623 --> 03:04:32.865]  Are they sometimes rude and tell you not to do jobs?
[03:04:32.865 --> 03:04:35.627]  It's even how to trick them, and the little girl's like, yes.
[03:04:35.627 --> 03:04:37.408]  Oh, we're going to take you from your mommy then.
[03:04:37.768 --> 03:04:43.272]  I mean, wouldn't it be great to be an independent news journalist and say, hey, I'm with You Do News, I'm doing an expose.
[03:04:43.272 --> 03:04:44.613]  Darryl, I'm going to get behind it.
[03:04:44.613 --> 03:04:46.414]  I'd like to talk to the school principal.
[03:04:46.414 --> 03:04:47.235]  Are you kidding?
[03:04:47.235 --> 03:04:51.178]  And then put him on You Do News and expose, bring the New World Order into the world.
[03:04:51.178 --> 03:04:52.439]  Hey, I want to link to alternative videos.
[03:04:52.439 --> 03:04:54.600]  You know what happens to cockroaches when you turn on the light?
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:55.341]  They run.
[03:04:55.341 --> 03:04:56.522]  Hey, good to hear from you, Kirk.
[03:04:56.522 --> 03:04:58.723]  Keep it up, let us know how this develops.
[03:04:58.723 --> 03:05:00.765]  Jeff, Catalina, David, Jake, stay with us.
[03:05:01.604 --> 03:05:10.247]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[03:05:10.247 --> 03:05:15.089]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[03:05:15.089 --> 03:05:20.831]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.
[03:05:20.831 --> 03:05:29.774]  Go to raworganicvegansuperfoods.com today and see the wide range of foods available that are designed to help your mind and body work the way they were intended to.

[03:05:34.660 --> 03:05:36.162]  Folks, you've got to try this.
[03:05:36.162 --> 03:05:42.671]  These foods promote nutritional excellence, health and well-being, beauty enhancement, and truly sustainable agriculture.
[03:05:42.671 --> 03:05:46.476]  Many foods today have herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, and insecticides.
[03:05:46.556 --> 03:05:49.297]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:05:49.297 --> 03:05:52.497]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:06:15.507 --> 03:06:22.090]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:22.090 --> 03:06:24.071]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:24.071 --> 03:06:26.572]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.572 --> 03:06:37.537]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.135 --> 03:06:39.817]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.817 --> 03:06:41.679]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:41.679 --> 03:06:48.586]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:06:56.854 --> 03:06:58.415]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.415 --> 03:06:59.617]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.684 --> 03:07:03.045]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[03:07:03.045 --> 03:07:05.446]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[03:07:05.446 --> 03:07:09.608]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:07:09.608 --> 03:07:13.370]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:07:13.370 --> 03:07:21.934]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:07:21.934 --> 03:07:25.776]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[03:07:25.776 --> 03:07:31.459]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods

[03:08:06.235 --> 03:08:07.537]  Big Brother.
[03:08:07.537 --> 03:08:09.299]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.299 --> 03:08:11.062]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.062 --> 03:08:12.664]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.664 --> 03:08:13.585]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.585 --> 03:08:18.412]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.412 --> 03:08:22.457]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.658 --> 03:08:28.800]  Bill Rundis has a joke before we take more calls.
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:29.701]  Go ahead, Darrell.
[03:08:29.701 --> 03:08:30.321]  Look at Alex.
[03:08:30.321 --> 03:08:32.122]  He's all spiffed up.
[03:08:32.122 --> 03:08:34.184]  He said he'd take me to dinner later tonight.
[03:08:34.184 --> 03:08:35.866]  I think his wife has something to worry about there, Alex.
[03:08:35.866 --> 03:08:37.987]  Will you get all dressed up for me there, boy?
[03:08:37.987 --> 03:08:39.408]  Absolutely there, Rundis.
[03:08:39.408 --> 03:08:40.369]  Very funny joke.
[03:08:40.369 --> 03:08:40.990]  I'm married.
[03:08:40.990 --> 03:08:42.331]  I've got five kids.
[03:08:42.331 --> 03:08:43.091]  Alright, alright, alright.
[03:08:43.091 --> 03:08:43.972]  Very good.
[03:08:43.972 --> 03:08:44.653]  Now, you know what?
[03:08:44.653 --> 03:08:45.673]  I've got an earpiece in.
[03:08:46.454 --> 03:08:48.857]  I'm starting to wear sports jackets on air.
[03:08:48.857 --> 03:08:53.643]  I think I should respect the audience enough, and I'm wearing a favorite 15-year-old t-shirt here.
[03:08:53.643 --> 03:08:57.808]  You'd be like Brocon, you know, Conkite and those guys looking all stiff in your jacket there.
[03:08:57.808 --> 03:08:59.230]  No, you know what?
[03:08:59.230 --> 03:09:03.435]  If it means we can reach more people, I'll wear a, you know, I'd wear a clown polka dot hat.
[03:09:03.655 --> 03:09:06.037]  I'd wear a pink polka dot hat if I could reach more people.
[03:09:06.037 --> 03:09:08.238]  Hey, he's a cretin from the planet Pop-Tart.
[03:09:08.238 --> 03:09:08.958]  Don't listen to him.
[03:09:08.958 --> 03:09:09.699]  No.
[03:09:09.699 --> 03:09:11.160]  I remember that color, yeah.
[03:09:11.160 --> 03:09:14.582]  No, people really believe I'm a reptoid ruler 14 trillion years old.
[03:09:14.582 --> 03:09:18.245]  I gotta be honest with you, I'd like to be 14 trillion years old and have been seeing the galaxy.
[03:09:19.445 --> 03:09:20.206]  But I'm not.
[03:09:20.206 --> 03:09:22.227]  I promise you, it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:09:22.227 --> 03:09:23.467]  I'm not from Planet Pop-Tart.
[03:09:23.467 --> 03:09:24.848]  Hey, you know what, I'm not a reptoid.
[03:09:24.848 --> 03:09:27.289]  It's funny, this verse always reminds me of you and the Bible.
[03:09:27.289 --> 03:09:30.731]  It says, Lord, teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
[03:09:30.731 --> 03:09:32.812]  And nobody makes more of a day than you do.
[03:09:32.812 --> 03:09:34.693]  I mean, you get more done in a day than anybody I ever met.
[03:09:34.913 --> 03:09:36.493]  Oh, Daryl, please stop it!
[03:09:36.493 --> 03:09:36.894]  Good Lord!
[03:09:36.894 --> 03:09:37.734]  No, it's the truth.
[03:09:37.734 --> 03:09:38.814]  I mean, it's the bottom line.
[03:09:38.814 --> 03:09:44.656]  In fact, I don't even know how you handle it when people call in and say, Oh, Alex, you gotta do more of this and do that, and I just blow up on them.
[03:09:44.656 --> 03:09:46.356]  Well, I actually appreciate most of it.
[03:09:46.356 --> 03:09:52.278]  You know, I got a book that I'm supposed to get done that I'm working on, and we're working on two films right now.
[03:09:53.198 --> 03:09:55.719]  And I get so busy, I don't even, you know, get to everything I'm supposed to.
[03:09:55.719 --> 03:09:59.320]  Did you get those jet-powered roller skates that I sent?
[03:09:59.320 --> 03:10:00.760]  No, but that would help, that would help.
[03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:01.420]  You need them.
[03:10:01.420 --> 03:10:19.105]  But the issue is, I'll tell you what's beautiful, is the people are doing what we're talking about, and they're doing it better than I could in many ways, and the activists, you know, they're going to these media events where the establishment is meeting and taking them over just with, you know, political questions and things and getting the news, and the system realizes that the people that love liberty and freedom and the truth
[03:10:19.685 --> 03:10:24.186]  We are infesting, in their view, the entire system and taking over.
[03:10:24.186 --> 03:10:26.046]  I mean, I've had CBS News call me.
[03:10:26.046 --> 03:10:27.587]  I've had Politico call me today.
[03:10:27.587 --> 03:10:34.528]  You know, the entire establishment, thanks to you, Darrell, supporting us and many others, is starting to pay attention to what we're doing.
[03:10:34.528 --> 03:10:37.029]  Look at how they're trying to co-op Ron Paul.
[03:10:37.029 --> 03:10:42.390]  But as they do that, that only makes our movement that much bigger because they can't co-op Ron Paul.
[03:10:42.930 --> 03:10:48.474]  You know, we're about information and facts and data and reality, and so their old tricks aren't going to work, Darrell.
[03:10:48.474 --> 03:10:52.456]  Look, look, people know the truth when they see it, and the truth will always, you know, come to the surface.
[03:10:52.456 --> 03:10:55.018]  And there's people, once again, where is the power, Alex?
[03:10:55.018 --> 03:10:55.578]  Is it with you?
[03:10:55.578 --> 03:10:59.381]  No, it's with you and you and you and you and all those other people out there in the world today.
[03:10:59.381 --> 03:11:02.083]  We all have the power, but we've got to do something with it.
[03:11:02.083 --> 03:11:04.685]  We've got to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
[03:11:04.685 --> 03:11:06.666]  We've got to make the most of every opportunity and every day.
[03:11:07.026 --> 03:11:11.507]  And once again, U2 News is a great opportunity, great platform for them to get the word out.
[03:11:26.491 --> 03:11:30.453]  Just so you know, with video though, you need CDNs.
[03:11:30.453 --> 03:11:34.474]  Yeah, I'll be talking to your tech guys, because I'm going to need all the help we can get.
[03:11:34.474 --> 03:11:36.595]  I'm impressed with the way you guys... Oh, we're not.
[03:11:36.595 --> 03:11:37.295]  Believe me.
[03:11:37.295 --> 03:11:42.057]  My guys could do a lot more if I had more money, but the point is that we've learned through trial and error, and we've learned a lot.
[03:11:42.057 --> 03:11:43.918]  Now listen, Darrell, I want to go to calls.
[03:11:43.918 --> 03:11:46.079]  I want folks to know more about you.
[03:11:46.079 --> 03:11:48.980]  You want to tell folks about the big Christian ministry you started that's now a national TV show?
[03:11:49.500 --> 03:11:55.508]  I mean, you know, the Great News Network's a ministry of a bunch of different Christians all around the country who are actively waking people up.
[03:11:55.508 --> 03:12:05.260]  And because we know the first priority is someone's soul, while they will start in the natural and tell people about the Fed or about the evil tyrannies or the craziness that's going on in Washington, D.C.
[03:12:05.260 --> 03:12:06.262]  or, you know, any of these other things,
[03:12:06.682 --> 03:12:13.208]  We know, ultimately, if that person wakes up, continues to fight the New World Order, but ends up in hell, in the end, what good did we really do them?
[03:12:13.208 --> 03:12:20.414]  Well, Darrell, I want to thank you for your generous support in the past, and I want to thank you for your support in the future, and I want to tell you, you know, you say you're starting with something big.
[03:12:20.414 --> 03:12:24.137]  It is big for you to start a radio show, and I'm the one that's been pushing you, and Ted's offered you one.
[03:12:24.137 --> 03:12:29.442]  You really should start at least a three-hour weekend show, and also simulcast it on your new TV station.
[03:12:29.462 --> 03:12:32.627]  No, we're going to do a Rundis Report.
[03:12:32.627 --> 03:12:37.274]  In 60 days we'll go beta, and in about 90 days I'll start doing a weekly report called the Rundis Report.
[03:12:37.274 --> 03:12:43.824]  Well, this video you guys did here with you pushing the Ten and Win.com, that looks really good.
[03:12:43.824 --> 03:12:44.766]  So you got some good guys.
[03:12:44.906 --> 03:12:52.851]  We've got good media guys, we've got great web work, you know, I'm just haven't caught up on the curve when it comes to... No, I know, people when I did last year's Money Bomb, they're like, where's the new studio?
[03:12:52.851 --> 03:13:03.258]  It took me months to find the cheapest, best place, then I had to move, do all the contracts, took them months, had to move in, put it all in while I was doing everything else, then get in here and now we're ready to go to the next level.
[03:13:03.258 --> 03:13:05.119]  I mean, it takes time when you're small.
[03:13:05.219 --> 03:13:05.900]  I think exactly.
[03:13:05.900 --> 03:13:12.305]  I think people, there's a big disconnect between mainstream media and what you're able to accomplish because they got unlimited, literally unlimited amounts of money.
[03:13:12.305 --> 03:13:16.789]  It's like the government, they don't care about how much money they spend because they never have to pay it back.
[03:13:16.789 --> 03:13:23.314]  So those mainstream media, they can throw billions and billions and billions of people's dollars at it and then get bailout after they go broke.
[03:13:23.314 --> 03:13:28.759]  Look at what we've done though with the equivalent of one one-hundredth or one one-thousandth of what they do.
[03:13:28.899 --> 03:13:29.319]  That's incredible.
[03:13:29.319 --> 03:13:30.660]  And think what other people can do.
[03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:32.260]  But I'm done ranting about that.
[03:13:32.260 --> 03:13:35.902]  The point is, we can win if you take action.
[03:13:35.902 --> 03:13:38.663]  There are a lot of you smarter than me and Daryl, more active.
[03:13:38.663 --> 03:13:41.024]  We've all got different gifts, different combinations of those gifts.
[03:13:41.024 --> 03:13:41.324]  That's right.
[03:13:41.324 --> 03:13:43.165]  And you do news isn't the answer to everything.
[03:13:43.165 --> 03:13:49.467]  Once again, it could be pick up your bullhorn, wear a t-shirt like we do, pass out some literature, break the ice with people.
[03:13:49.467 --> 03:13:54.550]  Here's a great way to get a CD, a DVD, or whatever message in somebody's hands.
[03:13:54.550 --> 03:13:57.211]  You know all I've got to say is, hey, do you like the government?
[03:13:57.211 --> 03:13:57.651]  What do you say?
[03:13:58.607 --> 03:13:59.087]  No.
[03:13:59.087 --> 03:14:00.428]  Here, you'll need this, okay?
[03:14:00.428 --> 03:14:02.068]  Now I say, do you like the government?
[03:14:02.068 --> 03:14:02.949]  And say yes.
[03:14:02.949 --> 03:14:03.309]  Yes.
[03:14:03.309 --> 03:14:04.629]  Oh, you need this, okay?
[03:14:04.629 --> 03:14:06.530]  So just ask a question, no matter what they say.
[03:14:06.530 --> 03:14:07.851]  Hey, do you live here in town?
[03:14:07.851 --> 03:14:08.351]  Yeah, I do.
[03:14:08.351 --> 03:14:09.671]  Oh, great, you'll need this.
[03:14:09.671 --> 03:14:10.852]  Everybody will take what they want.
[03:14:10.852 --> 03:14:11.752]  Well, what I do, 90% of the time.
[03:14:11.752 --> 03:14:13.073]  It's like with, say, an Obama deception.
[03:14:13.073 --> 03:14:15.153]  Hey, this is a really wild film about Obama.
[03:14:15.153 --> 03:14:16.014]  You ought to check it out.
[03:14:16.014 --> 03:14:16.254]  Right.
[03:14:16.254 --> 03:14:18.315]  Hey, do you like Obama?
[03:14:18.315 --> 03:14:18.895]  Do you like Obama?
[03:14:19.594 --> 03:14:19.955]  No.
[03:14:19.955 --> 03:14:20.956]  Oh, you'll need this.
[03:14:20.956 --> 03:14:21.496]  You'll like this.
[03:14:21.496 --> 03:14:22.558]  This great DVD, you'll like this.
[03:14:22.558 --> 03:14:23.279]  Oh, you like Obama?
[03:14:23.279 --> 03:14:24.000]  Oh, here, you'll like this.
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:25.141]  You'll like this DVD.
[03:14:25.141 --> 03:14:26.783]  So, whatever they say, yes or no, it doesn't matter.
[03:14:26.783 --> 03:14:34.072]  Well, I've told listeners, and of course you're a more professional salesman than I am, I just, you know, do it innately, but I've always found if you're confident and happy
[03:14:34.693 --> 03:14:37.916]  People will then take the info, but other folks are like, I've got this for you.
[03:14:37.916 --> 03:14:41.099]  Well, there's an old saying that says, if you don't seem interested, how are they going to be?
[03:14:41.099 --> 03:14:44.823]  So, I mean, if you're not excited about what you're doing, how are they ever going to get excited about what you're doing?
[03:14:44.823 --> 03:14:46.825]  So, yeah, enthusiasm is the key.
[03:14:46.825 --> 03:14:49.848]  You've got to go with zeal, but not with no knowledge.
[03:14:49.848 --> 03:14:51.709]  You've got to have wisdom to go with that zeal.
[03:14:51.709 --> 03:14:53.932]  You've got too much zeal and no wisdom, you're going to scare people off.
[03:14:53.932 --> 03:14:55.293]  You're going to scare all the fish away.
[03:14:55.293 --> 03:14:58.236]  But when you go fishing, you've got to be quiet, you've got to be stealthy, and you've got to use the right bait.
[03:14:58.656 --> 03:15:02.437]  So, bait your hook with certain questions that are leading, okay?
[03:15:02.437 --> 03:15:04.518]  It doesn't matter if they say yes or no.
[03:15:04.518 --> 03:15:05.798]  Hey, do you love our government?
[03:15:05.798 --> 03:15:06.798]  Hey, do you like taxes?
[03:15:06.798 --> 03:15:07.979]  Hey, do you like green?
[03:15:07.979 --> 03:15:09.459]  Hey, are you married?
[03:15:09.459 --> 03:15:11.660]  Whatever question, it doesn't matter what they say.
[03:15:11.660 --> 03:15:13.740]  If they say yes or no, say, hey, well, you'll like this.
[03:15:13.740 --> 03:15:15.241]  Or, hey, you'll need this.
[03:15:15.241 --> 03:15:16.661]  The key is sowing those seeds.
[03:15:16.661 --> 03:15:18.282]  Once again, they won't all take root.
[03:15:18.282 --> 03:15:19.702]  They all won't bear fruit.
[03:15:19.702 --> 03:15:21.642]  But the bottom line is you just keep being faithful.
[03:15:21.642 --> 03:15:23.103]  You get the seeds in the ground, it's going to happen.
[03:15:23.103 --> 03:15:24.243]  Let's take some more calls.
[03:15:24.243 --> 03:15:25.283]  Catalina in Michigan.
[03:15:25.283 --> 03:15:26.264]  You're on the air with Daryl Rondis.
[03:15:26.264 --> 03:15:26.964]  Go ahead, Catalina.
[03:15:28.561 --> 03:15:28.901]  Hello?
[03:15:28.901 --> 03:15:31.002]  Hi, Catalina.
[03:15:31.002 --> 03:15:31.562]  Hi, Alex.
[03:15:31.562 --> 03:15:32.462]  How are you?
[03:15:32.462 --> 03:15:32.763]  Good.
[03:15:32.763 --> 03:15:33.143]  I'm good.
[03:15:33.143 --> 03:15:34.663]  I'm excited.
[03:15:34.663 --> 03:15:35.544]  Well, you know what?
[03:15:35.544 --> 03:15:38.845]  I wanted to tell you my husband was driving through Detroit.
[03:15:38.845 --> 03:15:42.006]  He was doing a job and he called me up immediately.
[03:15:42.006 --> 03:15:44.387]  He goes, Catalina, you wouldn't believe what I just saw.
[03:15:44.387 --> 03:15:45.747]  And I'm like, what?
[03:15:45.747 --> 03:15:47.488]  He says an Obama gas station.
[03:15:48.720 --> 03:15:55.183]  And it was in Wyoming in Plymouth Road, and he said they had Obama hats out there, and t-shirts, and they're selling all of Obama stuff.
[03:15:55.183 --> 03:15:57.864]  Yeah, they started Obama restaurants in New York.
[03:15:57.864 --> 03:15:59.324]  Obama!
[03:15:59.324 --> 03:16:01.785]  It scared the hell out of me.
[03:16:01.785 --> 03:16:03.926]  I'm like, what the heck's going on here?
[03:16:03.926 --> 03:16:08.028]  But, you know, I wanted to tell you, I am sowing the seeds.
[03:16:08.028 --> 03:16:10.409]  I belong to several business networks.
[03:16:10.409 --> 03:16:13.030]  I'm giving out DVDs.
[03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:14.231]  I'm talking to people.
[03:16:15.444 --> 03:16:16.805]  Giving them your website.
[03:16:33.109 --> 03:16:35.590]  You kind of blew my idea of overthrowing the government.
[03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:40.673]  So, what do you do to stop all this tyranny, stop all this terrorism?
[03:16:40.673 --> 03:16:46.956]  You just start saying no to corruption and you start getting involved in going to city council and speaking and going to church and speaking out.
[03:16:48.297 --> 03:16:49.658]  This New World Order will fall.
[03:16:49.658 --> 03:16:52.959]  If you just say no, no, no, there's more good people than there are evil.
[03:16:52.959 --> 03:16:55.741]  If we just take action and educate others, this thing will fall.
[03:16:55.741 --> 03:16:57.662]  I appreciate your call, Kathleen, a great call.
[03:16:57.662 --> 03:17:01.604]  And that was a question I wanted to have you on today about, because you're always so articulate over the phone about it.
[03:17:01.604 --> 03:17:03.645]  I want to have you back soon, Daryl, or over the phone at least.
[03:17:03.645 --> 03:17:04.826]  I don't want you to drive down from Dallas.
[03:17:05.746 --> 03:17:13.412]  Romans 13, taken completely out of context, you say you're talking to Christians and they're like, oh I'm just going to let it all come and let it end, even if it is the end of the world.
[03:17:13.412 --> 03:17:15.473]  Don't we have to warn people?
[03:17:15.473 --> 03:17:16.154]  Absolutely.
[03:17:16.154 --> 03:17:21.998]  I mean, that is just another excuse for people not to face their fear and to get up and get out and do something.
[03:17:21.998 --> 03:17:25.160]  I mean, we are called to be the light of the world as a Christian.
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:28.403]  I mean, I am, I'm just, you know what, I'm going to get sick to my stomach.
[03:17:28.883 --> 03:17:31.645]  When I think about all the apathy within the church today.
[03:17:31.645 --> 03:17:38.129]  It's not just people in America, but Christians in particular ought to be the ones leading the charge against the evil deeds done in darkness.
[03:17:38.129 --> 03:17:41.492]  They're called to expose those deeds done in darkness.
[03:17:41.492 --> 03:17:48.316]  And yet, every time I even share with them about a corrupt police officer, or about a politician who's lying, or cheating, or stealing, you know what they say?
[03:17:48.316 --> 03:17:50.718]  They say, oh, Romans 13, gotta submit to authority.
[03:17:50.718 --> 03:17:51.418]  Well, you know what?
[03:17:51.418 --> 03:17:52.339]  Poppycosh.
[03:17:52.339 --> 03:17:53.420]  I say, hey, you know what?
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:18:00.786]  Uh, to what authority Jesus was submitting to when he stood up to the Pharisees and the Sadducees and called them sons of hell and brood of vipers and hypocrites.
[03:18:00.786 --> 03:18:09.654]  To what authority were Paul and all the other apostles or all the other early Christians thrown to the lions because they wouldn't submit to the tyranny and the authority of the people that were above them.
[03:18:09.654 --> 03:18:15.179]  Now, if you continue to read Romans 13, what you come to realize is, one, it says, look, if you owe respect, give respect.
[03:18:15.579 --> 03:18:19.661]  Okay, so in other words, hey, if they come to arrest you, don't resist, okay?
[03:18:19.661 --> 03:18:21.923]  You know, they don't deserve it, they don't earn it, but hey, you know what?
[03:18:21.923 --> 03:18:24.344]  I've seen you get arrested in New York City, and what did you do?
[03:18:24.344 --> 03:18:25.104]  Did you throw a fit?
[03:18:25.104 --> 03:18:25.765]  Did you resist?
[03:18:25.765 --> 03:18:27.986]  No, you went with them and then... No, because then they lost.
[03:18:27.986 --> 03:18:29.226]  If I'd have fought back, they would have won.
[03:18:29.226 --> 03:18:30.187]  They would have won, that's right.
[03:18:30.187 --> 03:18:30.847]  It's like Gandhi.
[03:18:30.847 --> 03:18:31.548]  It made them look bad.
[03:18:31.548 --> 03:18:32.028]  That's right.
[03:18:32.028 --> 03:18:34.109]  So, civil disobedience.
[03:18:34.109 --> 03:18:34.789]  That's what we need.
[03:18:34.789 --> 03:18:35.970]  Civil is the key word.
[03:18:35.970 --> 03:18:36.870]  Civil disobedience.
[03:18:36.870 --> 03:18:40.773]  But moreover, look, our governing authority isn't the politicians, okay?
[03:18:40.773 --> 03:18:41.493]  They work for us.
[03:18:42.594 --> 03:18:45.015]  Well, if we had a godly government, it would be.
[03:18:45.015 --> 03:18:48.697]  And plus, this is a new government, a new form, where we the people, not a king.
[03:18:48.697 --> 03:18:49.137]  That's it.
[03:18:49.137 --> 03:18:49.978]  We're not subjects.
[03:18:49.978 --> 03:18:53.079]  And so that means, render unto Caesar, that's us.
[03:18:53.079 --> 03:18:53.700]  That's right.
[03:18:53.700 --> 03:18:54.480]  We are Caesar.
[03:18:54.480 --> 03:18:56.101]  The Constitution is our governing authority.
[03:18:56.101 --> 03:18:59.743]  And when you see someone breach that Constitution, you ought to get up, stand up.
[03:18:59.743 --> 03:19:00.304]  Exactly.
[03:19:00.304 --> 03:19:05.566]  When the police and the military and the government violates the Bill of Rights Constitution, they're violating Romans 13.
[03:19:05.566 --> 03:19:06.307]  They ought to go to jail.
[03:19:06.747 --> 03:19:07.748]  We ought to hold him accountable.
[03:19:07.748 --> 03:19:10.550]  I mean, I'm like with Ron Paul or Chuck Norris, man.
[03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:15.194]  I'd like to line up all those people and get with Ron Paul and say, which one of these guys is the crooks?
[03:19:15.194 --> 03:19:16.415]  And we'll just throw them in the heat pile.
[03:19:16.415 --> 03:19:23.020]  And if they don't want to go, we'll let Chuck put them in a sleeper hold until they just... And then Grundasaurus will come in and carry them and throw them on the heat pile.
[03:19:23.200 --> 03:19:25.921]  They're all a bunch of crooks and they need to go!
[03:19:25.921 --> 03:19:28.362]  Hey, Daryl, fire out the websites again.
[03:19:28.362 --> 03:19:29.423]  We'll have you back soon.
[03:19:29.423 --> 03:19:29.963]  Love you to death.
[03:19:29.963 --> 03:19:32.884]  Thank you for the donation, because they had a big victory taking that from us.
[03:19:32.884 --> 03:19:33.745]  Hey, it's mine!
[03:19:33.745 --> 03:19:34.585]  It's mine!
[03:19:34.585 --> 03:19:34.985]  I got it!
[03:19:34.985 --> 03:19:36.446]  TimAndWin.com.
[03:19:36.446 --> 03:19:38.867]  Go register to win, even if you can't list the law.
[03:19:38.867 --> 03:19:43.028]  And in 60 days and counting, YouDoNews.com.
[03:19:43.028 --> 03:19:44.549]  Get up, go out, get something.
[03:19:44.549 --> 03:19:46.790]  Well, Daryl, we'll have you back on as that launches.
[03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:47.690]  Thanks for all your support.
[03:19:47.690 --> 03:19:48.431]  Hey, my pleasure, man.
[03:19:48.431 --> 03:19:48.771]  God bless you.
[03:19:49.091 --> 03:19:49.672]  I like Daryl.
[03:19:49.672 --> 03:19:52.934]  He is a real character and a great guy and has a lot of energy.
[03:19:52.934 --> 03:19:58.198]  We'll be back with this Jesse Ventura where he talked about waterboarding with us six, seven months ago, airing for the first time here.
[03:19:58.198 --> 03:20:00.119]  It's such big news now, I thought I'd air it.
[03:20:00.119 --> 03:20:01.620]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.620 --> 03:20:02.921]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.921 --> 03:20:08.525]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.525 --> 03:20:13.528]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.528 --> 03:20:14.009]  It's true.
[03:20:14.009 --> 03:20:18.552]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:20:19.102 --> 03:20:24.324]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:24.324 --> 03:20:31.426]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.426 --> 03:20:32.547]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.547 --> 03:20:39.249]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:39.249 --> 03:20:42.430]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:20:42.430 --> 03:20:44.651]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:20:44.651 --> 03:20:45.571]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:20:49.226 --> 03:20:53.451]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:20:53.451 --> 03:20:58.297]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:20:58.297 --> 03:21:02.201]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:21:02.201 --> 03:21:07.448]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.218 --> 03:21:14.102]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.102 --> 03:21:20.606]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.606 --> 03:21:22.567]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.567 --> 03:21:25.048]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:25.048 --> 03:21:35.915]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:38.220 --> 03:21:39.880]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.880 --> 03:21:41.741]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.741 --> 03:21:48.643]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.643 --> 03:21:56.905]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.905 --> 03:21:58.486]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.486 --> 03:21:59.666]  The people strike back.
[03:22:02.068 --> 03:22:05.173]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[03:22:05.173 --> 03:22:12.223]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[03:22:12.223 --> 03:22:16.450]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[03:22:17.006 --> 03:22:26.611]  Call me at 800-686-2237 extension 115 and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[03:22:26.611 --> 03:22:37.077]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[03:22:37.077 --> 03:22:40.679]  Call me Duane Daly at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[03:22:44.981 --> 03:22:48.383]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[03:22:48.383 --> 03:22:51.144]  No amount is too small, so start today.
[03:22:51.144 --> 03:23:02.889]  Call Duane Daly with Midas resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[03:23:02.889 --> 03:23:13.093]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[03:23:14.068 --> 03:23:20.052]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[03:23:20.052 --> 03:23:24.275]  Starve or surrender.
[03:23:24.275 --> 03:23:28.298]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[03:23:28.871 --> 03:23:29.471]  What then?
[03:23:58.831 --> 03:23:58.874]  No.
[03:24:24.534 --> 03:24:30.880]  We got Jesse Ventura coming up in the next second, but I thought I'd play a little bit of a video in talking about waterboarding with us in the car when he was here about six months ago.
[03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:34.162]  I'll tell you about a few sponsors first who made this show possible.
[03:24:34.162 --> 03:24:37.265]  Homegain, H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[03:24:37.265 --> 03:24:45.152]  Go to Infowars.com, click on Max the Little Orange Gorilla, and go over there and enter your street address, get a free breakdown on how much your home is really worth.
[03:24:45.152 --> 03:24:47.194]  They have a home sale maximizer to tell you the best
[03:24:47.734 --> 03:24:53.180]  Improvements to make for the cheapest amount of money, for the greatest amount of value when you sell it and put it on the market.
[03:24:53.180 --> 03:24:54.521]  Been around for 10 years.
[03:24:54.521 --> 03:24:56.964]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[03:24:56.964 --> 03:25:01.769]  That is HomeGain.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:25:01.769 --> 03:25:08.596]  And one last sponsor of the day, eFoodsDirect.com, the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[03:25:09.236 --> 03:25:14.640]  eFoodsDirect.com, the highest quality storable foods at the best prices I've found anywhere.
[03:25:14.640 --> 03:25:19.104]  Non-GMO, non-hybrid, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:25:19.104 --> 03:25:21.425]  1-800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:25:21.425 --> 03:25:23.147]  It's time to get self-sufficient.
[03:25:23.147 --> 03:25:26.309]  eFoodsDirect.com or 1-800-409-5633.
[03:25:26.309 --> 03:25:29.752]  Okay, let's go ahead and play some of this video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:25:29.752 --> 03:25:31.573]  Audio for the listeners on the radio.
[03:25:31.573 --> 03:25:33.975]  Jesse Ventura, because we have hours and hours.
[03:25:33.975 --> 03:25:35.276]  We didn't put this on the web for some reason.
[03:25:35.876 --> 03:25:36.557]  You had to watch it?
[03:25:36.557 --> 03:25:37.338]  Yeah, let me show you that.
[03:25:52.964 --> 03:26:01.229]  Our country today is not the country that I defended when I was in the service back in the 1970s and 60s.
[03:26:01.229 --> 03:26:06.653]  Because back in those days, you still had to be charged with the crime before you were guilty of it.
[03:26:16.187 --> 03:26:26.071]  And today it seems, and back in those days, you had to be charged with the crime to be held.
[03:26:26.071 --> 03:26:34.674]  It seems today, now, they can arrest you, they can hold you for an undetermined, as long as they feel like it, like they're doing in Guantanamo.
[03:26:34.674 --> 03:26:37.555]  Well, the Military Commissions Act says they can grab American citizens.
[03:26:37.555 --> 03:26:38.236]  Which is absurd!
[03:26:38.236 --> 03:26:39.256]  Which is absurd!
[03:26:39.256 --> 03:26:42.377]  Well, I mean, how is it that the people running things aren't the bad guys?
[03:26:42.377 --> 03:26:44.718]  I'm not saying America's the bad guys, but people overseas, the government.
[03:26:45.029 --> 03:26:56.575]  When they wrote memos saying it's okay to torture people's children in front of their parents, it's okay to kill them if you didn't mean to kill them under the torture or the enhanced interrogation techniques.
[03:26:56.575 --> 03:27:08.481]  And so they played the lawyer game of saying, well, we don't call electroshocks or pulling out fingernails, we don't call it torture, we call it enhanced interrogation and then play that lawyer mind game.
[03:27:08.481 --> 03:27:09.282]  Can you speak to that?
[03:27:09.282 --> 03:27:13.924]  Well, I think, I don't know about all of that, but I will speak directly about waterboarding.
[03:27:15.118 --> 03:27:16.459]  I mean, specifically about torture.
[03:27:16.459 --> 03:27:21.861]  Well, no, I am, but I will only speak about waterboarding.
[03:27:21.861 --> 03:27:25.403]  I was waterboarded.
[03:27:25.403 --> 03:27:26.043]  In training?
[03:27:26.043 --> 03:27:28.904]  I was waterboarded by my own country.
[03:27:28.904 --> 03:27:36.608]  Now, if we call waterboarding torture, then why do we torture our own soldiers?
[03:27:38.908 --> 03:27:42.273]  And I'm not saying waterboarding isn't torture, it is.
[03:27:42.273 --> 03:27:44.035]  I deem it as torture.
[03:27:44.035 --> 03:27:46.259]  But yet, I was waterboarded.
[03:27:46.259 --> 03:27:54.791]  Everybody that I knew was waterboarded because it was part of what they called Sears School, which was survival, escape, resistance, and evasion.
[03:27:55.652 --> 03:28:00.793]  It was a required course if you were going into the combat zone back in the era of Vietnam.
[03:28:00.793 --> 03:28:02.554]  I'm sure it's probably still required today.
[03:28:02.554 --> 03:28:11.216]  Yeah, they were getting them ready to be tortured and to resist, and it's listed in those Army manuals as torture, so that disproves the White House letter saying it isn't torture.
[03:28:11.216 --> 03:28:22.179]  Well, and my simple response to all this, Alex, is I would like to take our five-time deferred Vice President Dick Cheney, I would like to waterboard him.
[03:28:23.459 --> 03:28:30.323]  And let him then make the determination, having been waterboarded, then we'll ask him whether he thinks it's torture or not.
[03:28:30.323 --> 03:28:33.886]  I got a feeling he'd drop dead with the heart that he has today.
[03:28:33.886 --> 03:28:40.930]  If you waterboarded Dick Cheney, I feel that he would become a fatality because, well, his weak heart wouldn't be able to take it.
[03:28:40.930 --> 03:28:49.876]  But my point being on doing that is, I think these people that determine what torture is or isn't, I think they should first have it done to them.
[03:28:51.556 --> 03:28:52.637]  Physically.
[03:28:52.637 --> 03:28:57.502]  And then let them make an actual determination on whether they felt it was torture or not.
[03:28:57.502 --> 03:28:59.003]  Can you describe what waterboarding was like?
[03:28:59.003 --> 03:29:00.945]  It was drowning.
[03:29:00.945 --> 03:29:03.908]  It gives a complete sensation that you are drowning.
[03:29:03.908 --> 03:29:04.889]  What did they do?
[03:29:04.889 --> 03:29:09.714]  They strap you down, they put a towel across your face, and they start pouring water into the towel.
[03:29:11.693 --> 03:29:29.629]  And naturally your mouth and that can't consume all the water you can't drink it quick enough as they pour it and it gives you the sensation it's going up your nose it's going down your throat and it gives you the complete feeling that you are drowning even though you're not the moment they stop it
[03:29:30.310 --> 03:29:33.052]  You know, then it'll subside.
[03:29:33.052 --> 03:29:34.413]  But that's the field waterboarding.
[03:29:34.413 --> 03:29:37.234]  They have another one where they put your head completely into a bathtub.
[03:29:37.234 --> 03:29:38.996]  Okay, I don't know about that one.
[03:29:38.996 --> 03:29:41.257]  They kill people doing that.
[03:29:41.257 --> 03:29:44.159]  The only kind we got was the field waterboarding.
[03:29:44.159 --> 03:29:46.440]  Alright, we'll be right back with the rest of this.
[03:29:46.440 --> 03:29:48.101]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:48.101 --> 03:29:51.904]  Infowars.com.
[03:29:51.904 --> 03:29:53.305]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.305 --> 03:29:55.846]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.846 --> 03:29:58.548]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.516 --> 03:30:03.177]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:03.177 --> 03:30:07.921]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:30:07.921 --> 03:30:08.962]  We need to be independent.
[03:30:14.428 --> 03:30:14.808]  We're good to go.
[03:30:36.407 --> 03:30:38.988]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:31:05.464 --> 03:31:08.089]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:08.089 --> 03:31:15.102]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.655 --> 03:31:22.238]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.238 --> 03:31:24.219]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.219 --> 03:31:26.720]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.720 --> 03:31:38.286]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.286 --> 03:31:39.966]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.966 --> 03:31:41.327]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.815 --> 03:31:48.738]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:31:57.002 --> 03:31:58.562]  The Obama Deception.

[03:33:16.636 --> 03:33:21.977]  Okay, let's finish up that last two minutes or so, that little clip of Jesse Ventura when he first talked about waterboarding chaining.
[03:33:21.977 --> 03:33:25.298]  That was the first time he ever talked about it that I knew of, and now it's big news today.
[03:33:25.298 --> 03:33:27.659]  We should have put that clip on the web.
[03:33:27.659 --> 03:33:28.919]  But let's go ahead and go back to that video.
[03:33:28.919 --> 03:33:29.579]  Here it is.
[03:33:29.579 --> 03:33:31.199]  Can you describe what waterboarding was like?
[03:33:31.199 --> 03:33:33.000]  Drowning.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:35.961]  It gives a complete sensation that you are drowning.
[03:33:35.961 --> 03:33:36.941]  What did they do?
[03:33:36.941 --> 03:33:41.762]  They strap you down, they put a towel across your face, and they start pouring water into the towel.
[03:33:43.758 --> 03:34:01.677]  and naturally your mouth and that can't consume all the water you can't drink it quick enough as they pour it and it gives you the sensation it's going up your nose it's going down your throat and it gives you the complete feeling that you are drowning even though you're not the moment they stop it
[03:34:02.358 --> 03:34:05.101]  You know, then it'll subside.
[03:34:05.101 --> 03:34:06.483]  But that's the field waterboarding.
[03:34:06.483 --> 03:34:09.306]  They have another one where they put your head completely into a bathtub.
[03:34:09.306 --> 03:34:11.068]  Okay, I don't know about that one.
[03:34:11.068 --> 03:34:13.331]  They kill people doing that.
[03:34:13.331 --> 03:34:18.196]  The only kind we got was the field waterboarding back in the early 70s.
[03:34:18.196 --> 03:34:19.077]  Oh, that's the classic one.
[03:34:19.898 --> 03:34:22.300]  And they did it to all of us at Sears School.
[03:34:22.300 --> 03:34:24.102]  It was part of the training.
[03:34:24.102 --> 03:34:31.729]  And so my argument there is, if waterboard is indeed torture, which I think it is, how come we allow it to torture?
[03:34:31.729 --> 03:34:40.397]  And for us SEALs, UDT SEAL guys, giving us waterboard, it was irrelevant.
[03:34:42.782 --> 03:34:43.782]  No, and I'll say that.
[03:34:43.782 --> 03:34:45.342]  It was irrelevant.
[03:34:45.342 --> 03:34:52.484]  Because in our platoons, and in all the people that I served with, we all had an agreement.
[03:34:52.484 --> 03:34:53.844]  We would never be captured.
[03:34:53.844 --> 03:34:55.944]  We'll die first.
[03:34:55.944 --> 03:35:00.825]  So why would I need to face the waterboard if I'm dead?
[03:35:00.825 --> 03:35:04.426]  All of us were under an agreement that we will die first.
[03:35:04.426 --> 03:35:06.266]  We will not be captured.
[03:35:06.266 --> 03:35:09.367]  We will go down in a blaze of glory.
[03:35:09.367 --> 03:35:11.347]  So why did I need to be waterboarded?
[03:35:13.002 --> 03:35:24.564]  When I had already made a conscious decision that if it ever got to the position where I felt I was going to be captured, I would take death first.
[03:35:24.564 --> 03:35:28.185]  My attitude was, I'll take three or four of them with me before I go.
[03:35:28.185 --> 03:35:35.207]  Because always remember the Seals, we don't get mad, we get even.
[03:35:35.207 --> 03:35:36.327]  That's how we operate.
[03:35:37.577 --> 03:35:56.142]  You know, but so to me I felt that the waterboarding and the whole POW thing was irrelevant to us because there's never been a SEAL captured, nor do I believe will there ever will be one, because the SEAL will die first in our type of operation.
[03:35:56.142 --> 03:36:00.563]  You know, the only way they'd capture the SEAL is if the SEAL didn't know he was going to get captured.
[03:36:02.116 --> 03:36:03.457]  And then if he got captured and dishonored?
[03:36:23.647 --> 03:36:27.208]  Hi Alex, I guess it's nice to be back, but I don't know, Mexico gets more attractive all the time.
[03:36:50.146 --> 03:36:51.307]  It absolutely does.
[03:36:51.307 --> 03:36:51.987]  Are you kidding?
[03:36:51.987 --> 03:36:54.129]  I would love to be down there on the beach and the surf as well.
[03:36:54.129 --> 03:36:58.752]  I went down to Mexico for a week a few months ago and I wanted to stay.
[03:36:58.752 --> 03:37:01.534]  Speaking of Mexico, let's bring up a question you haven't been asked.
[03:37:01.534 --> 03:37:03.415]  What do you think about all the hype of this flu?
[03:37:03.415 --> 03:37:10.300]  A couple people die and they act like it's the end of the world and Obama's saying that we may all be forced to take an inoculation in the fall.
[03:37:10.925 --> 03:37:15.268]  Well, you know, it's certainly something that you don't poo-poo, you know?
[03:37:15.268 --> 03:37:20.712]  Anytime you get a type of sickness like this, you need to pay attention to it.
[03:37:20.712 --> 03:37:35.183]  But I think it was completely overhyped by the media to put the country again into a scare pattern, which seems to be what the media enjoys to do now, is to cause fear and have everyone living in fear.
[03:37:36.122 --> 03:37:44.910]  What they need to understand is, okay, if there were 1,500 cases of it in Mexico City, yes, that's something to be very concerned about.
[03:37:44.910 --> 03:37:49.214]  I feel the Mexicans, I was down there, they did a terrific job with what they could do.
[03:37:49.214 --> 03:37:51.115]  They closed all the schools.
[03:37:51.115 --> 03:37:53.017]  They shut down all the soccer games.
[03:37:53.017 --> 03:37:55.139]  They did everything conceivably they could do.
[03:37:55.139 --> 03:38:00.764]  But remember, Mexico City is a city, what, two or three times the size of New York?
[03:38:01.434 --> 03:38:02.634]  Yeah, it's 30 plus million.
[03:38:02.634 --> 03:38:04.775]  You've got nearly 20 million people live there.
[03:38:04.775 --> 03:38:06.235]  More than that.
[03:38:06.235 --> 03:38:09.396]  1,500 cases of something is not that large.
[03:38:09.396 --> 03:38:17.598]  And I'm not saying it shouldn't be looked at, of course, but when I came home, I went to the airport because I flew this time.
[03:38:17.598 --> 03:38:22.940]  They made you fill out a questionnaire and they asked you questions about your, you know, how you felt.
[03:38:22.940 --> 03:38:27.761]  And then they actually have this device where they touched it to your wrist and it took your temperature.
[03:38:28.453 --> 03:38:36.458]  And they wrote that down, and if you went up to fly out, if your temperature was too high, you didn't get on the plane.
[03:38:36.458 --> 03:38:47.545]  Mexico did everything they could within their power when they learned that the swine flu was going around, that they did everything conceivably as a, you know, a poor nation that they could possibly do.
[03:38:47.545 --> 03:38:51.027]  Well, Governor, I agree with you, but I agree with the first thing you said.
[03:38:51.707 --> 03:39:01.975]  This was used to create hype and fear, and then to openly introduce, we might need to have martial law, there's going to be another breakout soon, and it's this whole infrastructure.
[03:39:01.975 --> 03:39:21.230]  Getting to the big national controversy, you've caused quite a buzz and helped, really I think single-handedly, push it back into the spotlight that Cheney and Bush committed all these crimes, ordered torture, and then burned their own underlings and sent them to prison for it, and are now denying it when we have their own memos from Gonzalez and others in Bush's speech.
[03:39:21.810 --> 03:39:25.074]  First of all, Alex, let's understand why the President wants to move forward.
[03:39:25.074 --> 03:39:26.575]  Because the Democrats are involved, too!
[03:39:44.249 --> 03:39:57.098]  You know, now maybe they didn't order it, but in my opinion they certainly knew what was going on and they didn't step forward because of their, you know, let's remember Democrats truly don't have spines for the most part.
[03:39:58.033 --> 03:40:01.138]  And so they condoned it and went along with it.
[03:40:01.138 --> 03:40:03.621]  That's why they don't want to continue with it.
[03:40:03.621 --> 03:40:12.433]  It's because whenever the government tells you it's time to move on, that means that both parties are involved and both of them did something wrong.
[03:40:12.433 --> 03:40:15.477]  They don't want you to know about it, so they want you to move on.
[03:40:16.804 --> 03:40:33.277]  So that's the dilemma you're faced with, and in light of the fact that it's basically all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress and everywhere out there, they're going to move on, and we'll be left like we always are, Alex, yelling out there going, where's justice?
[03:40:33.277 --> 03:40:36.620]  Justice will again have been lost, or blinded.
[03:40:37.113 --> 03:40:38.353]  Well, that's my question to you.
[03:40:38.353 --> 03:40:50.818]  I mean, from your perspective, how do we get out of this left-right where, as you described when we interviewed you, two different wrestlers, you know, play the bad guy, the good guy, but really they're on the same team.
[03:40:50.818 --> 03:40:56.300]  How do we get past that and ever get these special interests and these elites out of the way that are doing this to us?
[03:40:56.360 --> 03:40:58.221]  Well, Alex, that's simple.
[03:40:58.221 --> 03:41:02.442]  The lemmings out there have to start voting for the independents.
[03:41:02.442 --> 03:41:06.303]  Look it, we tried our asses off to get Dean Barclay elected.
[03:41:06.303 --> 03:41:07.724]  He did very, very well.
[03:41:07.724 --> 03:41:10.445]  He got over 400,000 votes.
[03:41:10.445 --> 03:41:13.025]  But we have to continue from there and keep going.
[03:41:13.025 --> 03:41:16.206]  The only way is to win elections.
[03:41:16.206 --> 03:41:23.969]  The only way is to not vote for Democrats and Republicans and stop being lemmings and believing it's your only choice.
[03:41:25.882 --> 03:41:26.462]  Absolutely.
[03:41:26.462 --> 03:41:28.463]  It's like a Don King... Can it be done?
[03:41:28.463 --> 03:41:29.624]  I don't know.
[03:41:29.624 --> 03:41:31.405]  Well, it's like a Don King boxing match.
[03:41:31.405 --> 03:41:35.206]  I mean, you know both fighters are owned by him, so what's the point of watching it?
[03:41:35.206 --> 03:41:37.447]  You know it's a rigged deal.
[03:41:37.447 --> 03:41:40.009]  Speaking of Dick Cheney... Oh, Alex, come on.
[03:41:40.009 --> 03:41:42.970]  So is wrestling, and that's entertaining as hell.
[03:41:42.970 --> 03:41:47.712]  Hey, speaking of that, you went to UFC and saw one of those events, didn't you?
[03:41:47.712 --> 03:41:50.914]  Do you still think it might be fake?
[03:41:50.914 --> 03:41:52.474]  Oh, the Ultimate Fighting?
[03:41:52.474 --> 03:41:52.635]  Yeah.
[03:41:54.669 --> 03:41:56.570]  Let me put it to you this way.
[03:41:56.570 --> 03:42:00.112]  Brock Lesnar, who's the champ now, right?
[03:42:00.112 --> 03:42:00.953]  Yes.
[03:42:00.953 --> 03:42:08.156]  Brock Lesnar told me that pro wrestling is tougher.
[03:42:08.156 --> 03:42:08.917]  Really?
[03:42:08.917 --> 03:42:12.358]  Yeah, that kind of stuns you, doesn't it?
[03:42:12.358 --> 03:42:13.739]  But you know why he says it?
[03:42:13.739 --> 03:42:14.940]  Here's why.
[03:42:14.940 --> 03:42:22.664]  Brock told me pro wrestling is harder because in ultimate fighting, he only has to go in there for 15 minutes of hell.
[03:42:23.502 --> 03:42:31.927]  Then he takes two to three months rest, he trains for two months, and he goes back in for 15 minutes of hell.
[03:42:31.927 --> 03:42:40.832]  Well, in pro wrestling, you gotta wrestle every night, you gotta do interviews, you gotta travel all over the country from one end to the other.
[03:42:40.832 --> 03:42:45.235]  It's the most exhausting business you can possibly be in.
[03:42:45.235 --> 03:42:46.976]  So that's why.
[03:42:46.976 --> 03:42:48.596]  Do I think they're really fighting?
[03:42:48.596 --> 03:42:49.137]  Yes, I do.
[03:42:49.932 --> 03:42:51.354]  Have you seen the movie The Wrestler?
[03:42:51.354 --> 03:42:51.714]  No, I have not.
[03:42:51.714 --> 03:42:52.435]  I just got back from Mexico.
[03:42:52.435 --> 03:42:53.075]  Well, I can tell you this.
[03:42:53.075 --> 03:42:55.097]  I think that rather than what Hulk Hogan says, it's about him.
[03:43:08.863 --> 03:43:10.085]  No, it's not.
[03:43:10.085 --> 03:43:15.452]  But from what I know about the film, I believe it's about Jake the Snake Roberts much more.
[03:43:15.452 --> 03:43:22.601]  Because if you go to a movie that was a documentary called Beyond the Map, that was done by a friend of mine, Barry Blaustein,
[03:43:23.192 --> 03:43:41.091]  If you go watch that movie, you'll see that this character very much parallels the Mickey Rourke character in the fact that he went through ups and downs, he achieved the greatest in his career, he ended up down on the bottom again, and he had a great deal of battle with a lot of demons, including a daughter.
[03:43:42.032 --> 03:43:42.752]  I don't think so.
[03:44:10.549 --> 03:44:13.753]  Hey, by the way, I loved what you revealed about Hogan on Stern the other day.
[03:44:13.753 --> 03:44:15.856]  I happened to hear that.
[03:44:15.856 --> 03:44:16.557]  Don't do it here!
[03:44:16.557 --> 03:44:18.339]  No, I won't.
[03:44:18.339 --> 03:44:21.243]  This is a conservative show, but it was hilarious.
[03:44:21.243 --> 03:44:22.224]  Okay.
[03:44:22.224 --> 03:44:22.865]  Oh my goodness.
[03:44:22.865 --> 03:44:25.809]  Okay, the time we've got, we're going to get serious.
[03:44:25.809 --> 03:44:26.910]  Don't forget something.
[03:44:26.910 --> 03:44:28.733]  We Navy SEALs don't get mad, we get even.
[03:44:31.356 --> 03:44:36.057]  Well, I've got you for a full hour to take calls, come up in about 8-9 days, and we appreciate that time.
[03:44:36.057 --> 03:44:42.539]  We'll get more into all that other stuff and all the serious issues, but tell us about the paperback of Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[03:44:42.539 --> 03:44:55.203]  Well, you know, I added, because the epilogue was now outdated, I don't know if they removed it, but I added a couple of new chapters and we updated it, which is what they always do when a hardcover goes to paperback.
[03:44:55.828 --> 03:45:02.194]  But, you know, I updated a few, a new chapter in it and all that stuff, but again, it's a wake-up call, I hope.
[03:45:02.194 --> 03:45:16.706]  I hope this country will wake up to the fact that, you know, dissension is the greatest form of patriotism, and the fact that if you don't hold your government officials' feet to the fire, you're going to get bad government, that that's good, that that's not unpatriotic.
[03:45:17.424 --> 03:45:29.235]  And we better start taking our country back or we're going to lose it because, Alex, you know, to me, if we're torturing people now, that means the terrorists are winning.
[03:45:29.235 --> 03:45:31.698]  Because they're changing America.
[03:45:31.698 --> 03:45:34.140]  And that's what they've set out to do.
[03:45:34.140 --> 03:45:35.681]  Do we really want them to win?
[03:45:35.681 --> 03:45:37.063]  I don't.
[03:45:38.499 --> 03:45:50.822]  Well, Jesse, I mean, Governor, you're a smart guy, and we've had a lot of talks, and I know you're getting deeper into the whole underworld of the New World Order and all this, doing a lot more research on it and working on a lot of projects, a book and a TV show and the rest of it.
[03:45:50.822 --> 03:45:57.404]  I don't know how much that we can get into, but, you know, some of that's got, you know, a gag order on it because it's being produced right now.
[03:45:59.226 --> 03:46:03.810]  We talk about the buildings clearly being blown up, and then the question is who could put them in there?
[03:46:03.810 --> 03:46:04.411]  Who could do it?
[03:46:04.411 --> 03:46:18.264]  I know you've been in Mexico, but now they've had top scientists, two peer-reviewed journals, top Dutch physicists have come out, International News, BBC, National TV in Europe, confirming they actually got the thermate samples from the buildings.
[03:46:18.264 --> 03:46:20.286]  They were blown up with explosive thermate.
[03:46:21.387 --> 03:46:31.531]  Then you have the folks at NIST that are covering all this up, just so happen to be three of the top seven or so experts in explosive thermite, thermate in the world.
[03:46:31.531 --> 03:46:34.953]  So, come on, this whole terrorist thing, it's a fraud.
[03:46:34.953 --> 03:46:38.014]  They've used this to take our liberties, to take our freedoms.
[03:46:38.014 --> 03:46:41.716]  And the same elite that was in control when Bush was in control, is in control with Obama.
[03:46:41.716 --> 03:46:44.357]  Aren't you worried that they're talking about going into Iran now?
[03:46:44.357 --> 03:46:47.678]  And aren't you worried the same global elite might stage more terror attacks?
[03:46:47.678 --> 03:46:49.279]  Or do you think that was just Bush?
[03:46:49.833 --> 03:46:50.633]  Well, I don't know.
[03:46:50.633 --> 03:46:58.935]  I hate to say it, but until they do something, we won't know, will we, Alex?
[03:46:58.935 --> 03:47:00.696]  Because we're not on the inner circle.
[03:47:00.696 --> 03:47:10.338]  We're not sitting in on the meetings where the decisions are made, so I can only respond as it happens.
[03:47:10.338 --> 03:47:13.739]  I guess the Iranians blew off a missile.
[03:47:13.739 --> 03:47:16.999]  They showed me film, I guess, of some missile going up in the air.
[03:47:16.999 --> 03:47:18.640]  Do I really know they did it?
[03:47:18.640 --> 03:47:19.080]  I don't know.
[03:47:19.780 --> 03:47:27.444]  You know, you get to the point, especially with our news media today, that you don't know what to believe and what not to believe.
[03:47:27.444 --> 03:47:36.588]  Initially, you come out and they make you believe something, and then four to six months later, you learn other things that make you disbelieve what they were told you.
[03:47:36.588 --> 03:47:40.610]  So, when they tell me something today, I don't know whether to believe it or not.
[03:47:42.848 --> 03:47:44.510]  Absolutely, Jesse.
[03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:47.292]  Let me bring this question up to you then.
[03:47:47.292 --> 03:47:50.936]  On 888, I get up, CNN says Russia has snuck attack Georgia.
[03:47:51.772 --> 03:48:03.678]  Then I get to the office and I'm watching foreign TV and even reading, you know, down deep in the Associated Press that Georgia snuck attack South Ossetia and then two days later they admitted, okay, it was all a PR stunt, NATO and U.S.
[03:48:03.678 --> 03:48:06.640]  troops were there advising the sneak attack on the Russians.
[03:48:06.640 --> 03:48:13.083]  I mean, that's how much our media and government will lie, is that they will launch sneak attacks on Russian territories.
[03:48:13.083 --> 03:48:15.024]  Does that sound like a good idea to you, Jesse?
[03:48:15.024 --> 03:48:16.285]  No, not at all.
[03:48:16.285 --> 03:48:20.847]  You know, that sounds to me like, you know, if I could go back in history,
[03:48:21.786 --> 03:48:23.272]  Is Howard Hunt still alive?
[03:48:26.966 --> 03:48:29.247]  Spoilers off, Alex!
[03:48:29.247 --> 03:48:46.695]  No, I mean, that sounds like the stuff they were doing to Cuba back down there in the, you know, the days of the Bay of Pigs and all that stuff when our CIA was down there trying to overthrow Castro secretly and making attempts and blowing up ships in the harbor and doing all that sort of behavior.
[03:48:46.695 --> 03:48:51.898]  It reminds me of the stuff that went on in Central America during the whole Iran-Contra stink.
[03:48:52.558 --> 03:49:04.734]  What this country's got to do is get its head out of its you-know-what and start realizing that there's a reason that these people don't like us out there in the world.
[03:49:04.734 --> 03:49:07.058]  And a lot of it's got to do with our behavior.
[03:49:07.757 --> 03:49:17.245]  I agree, and this corrupt offshore elites that are using the United States as their tool or their front man, their strong man, their engine to carry this out.
[03:49:17.245 --> 03:49:23.370]  Can you talk about what we discussed this morning in that conversation about how you're discovering more and more stuff?
[03:49:23.370 --> 03:49:25.472]  You're writing a book about conspiracies.
[03:49:25.472 --> 03:49:28.835]  The point about Lincoln, or do you want to just not get into that?
[03:49:28.835 --> 03:49:30.096]  Oh no, that's fine.
[03:49:30.096 --> 03:49:32.338]  Well, the story I can tell you is this.
[03:49:32.338 --> 03:49:35.741]  You know, Dick Russell, my co-writer, he brought this to my attention.
[03:49:36.421 --> 03:49:44.384]  He sat me down, and we were down together in the Bahan, and he just looked at me, and he said, Governor, he said, what do you know about the murder of Abraham Lincoln?
[03:49:44.384 --> 03:49:46.525]  What were you taught in school?
[03:49:46.525 --> 03:50:05.392]  And I said, well, what I recall that I was taught in school is that Abraham and his wife went to the movie theater, the Ford Theater, and that John Wilkes Booth snuck up behind him, shot him in the head, tried to jump from the balcony, hooked his leg on something or other, broke his leg, they trailed him to a cabin and killed him, burnt him or whatever.
[03:50:06.201 --> 03:50:08.102]  I said, that's what I was taught.
[03:50:08.102 --> 03:50:22.867]  And Dick said to me, so they never taught you that there were actually seven people arrested, tried, and convicted for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the attempt on Ulysses S. Grant and Vice President Johnson?
[03:50:22.867 --> 03:50:27.369]  I said, I never heard a word about that till you told me that right now.
[03:50:27.369 --> 03:50:29.550]  And so what causes me concern is that
[03:50:30.496 --> 03:50:31.296]  I don't know.
[03:50:31.296 --> 03:50:36.038]  Why don't we put that in our school books about what really happened?
[03:50:36.038 --> 03:50:47.103]  That there was this literal attempt from the Confederacy to assassinate three of the top union leaders, the President, the Vice President, and General Grant.
[03:50:47.103 --> 03:50:52.905]  Now the issue is, why isn't this put in school books, regardless of what side of this you're on?
[03:50:52.905 --> 03:50:55.406]  Why don't they write the truth about history?
[03:50:55.406 --> 03:50:57.687]  And it scares me to death to think, okay,
[03:50:58.536 --> 03:51:02.442]  What can you believe in our history books that our children are reading today?
[03:51:02.442 --> 03:51:03.743]  You know?
[03:51:03.743 --> 03:51:15.799]  Are they going to continue to tell us that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Jack Kennedy when there's enough evidence out there that indicates if he did take part in it, he certainly didn't do it alone?
[03:51:16.280 --> 03:51:17.922]  Well, Governor, here's another one.
[03:51:17.922 --> 03:51:24.067]  It is mainline history, even in Shires, Risenfall, Third Reich, Pulitzer Prize winning.
[03:51:24.067 --> 03:51:29.592]  It's in all the major mainline history books, but it's never on Discovery Channel, History Channel, the news.
[03:51:29.592 --> 03:51:31.213]  Did you know that the British and U.S.
[03:51:31.213 --> 03:51:38.520]  governments actually funded Hitler, that Edward VIII, a king, was a Nazi, had to escape Germany when the war started, and that
[03:51:38.860 --> 03:51:44.185]  The West basically told Hitler to go ahead and do what he did, that they were going to back him and then they turned against him.
[03:51:44.185 --> 03:51:45.746]  I mean, Hitler's still evil.
[03:51:45.746 --> 03:51:49.910]  The point is, is that that's why they let the British escape at Dunkirk and all that.
[03:51:49.910 --> 03:51:56.056]  That's why the Reich Fuhrer came in and parachuted into England with a peace treaty saying, I have the peace treaty.
[03:51:56.056 --> 03:51:57.397]  You know, why are you doing this?
[03:51:57.397 --> 03:51:58.198]  We had a deal.
[03:51:59.018 --> 03:52:01.540]  Alex, I have to tell you, I don't know of any of that.
[03:52:01.540 --> 03:52:02.821]  I have to claim ignorance.
[03:52:02.821 --> 03:52:04.182]  I've never studied it.
[03:52:04.182 --> 03:52:05.783]  I probably should.
[03:52:05.783 --> 03:52:08.564]  But, you know, there's only so many hours in the day.
[03:52:08.564 --> 03:52:09.445]  Well, no, exactly.
[03:52:09.445 --> 03:52:10.786]  I'm saying you're a prominent guy.
[03:52:10.786 --> 03:52:12.487]  Get your writer to look into that.
[03:52:12.487 --> 03:52:15.969]  Because that's something that is mainline Pulitzer Prize.
[03:52:15.969 --> 03:52:18.971]  It's just in there, though, like it's no big deal.
[03:52:18.971 --> 03:52:22.773]  It's kind of like an elephant in the living room and nobody's even pointing it out.
[03:52:22.773 --> 03:52:24.755]  Yeah, you can't see the forest for the trees.
[03:52:25.760 --> 03:52:26.580]  Absolutely.
[03:52:26.580 --> 03:52:27.260]  Did you get enough time?
[03:52:27.260 --> 03:52:28.721]  Okay, yeah, no, interesting stuff.
[03:52:28.721 --> 03:52:47.904]  The book we're going to write though is going to deal with multiple conspiracies down through the years and, you know, and cover them and just, you know, hopefully make people think a little bit and realize, because I still sit back and say, you're telling me all the assassinations of the 60s were all done by lone nuts?
[03:52:47.904 --> 03:52:54.145]  You know, I lived through that and I just can't believe that there wasn't one more person involved than who they told us.
[03:52:55.114 --> 03:52:58.815]  Well, it's now come out that Patty Hearst and the Weathermen, that that was all staged.
[03:52:58.815 --> 03:53:00.456]  That's mainstream declassified.
[03:53:00.456 --> 03:53:10.199]  And every time I hear about mad bombers that are about to blow something up, I was in the shower this morning with the radio on, listening to NPR, and they admitted this latest group of idiots they found in New York.
[03:53:10.199 --> 03:53:15.161]  They admit, oh, by the way, the informants set up the group, were leading it, and gave them the explosives.
[03:53:17.805 --> 03:53:21.388]  Well, again, Alex, you know more than I do on that stuff.
[03:53:21.388 --> 03:53:24.330]  I can't comment on it because I have no idea.
[03:53:24.330 --> 03:53:32.275]  Well, you're a very smart guy, and you've got a lot of courage, Jesse, and you've certainly been learning a lot of stuff I didn't know about, and you've taught me quite a bit about things that have happened.
[03:53:32.275 --> 03:53:35.177]  You've got to remember, Alex, you're here all the time now.
[03:53:35.177 --> 03:53:37.459]  I take a leave of absence for six months.
[03:53:38.649 --> 03:53:39.730]  Well, I think that's good.
[03:53:39.730 --> 03:53:41.631]  I think you deserve it after all you've done.
[03:53:41.631 --> 03:53:44.973]  Speaking of that, they keep asking you, are you going to run for the Senate?
[03:53:44.973 --> 03:53:46.013]  Are you going to run for governor?
[03:53:46.013 --> 03:53:47.814]  Are you ever going to run for office again?
[03:53:47.814 --> 03:53:49.835]  At this time, no, I don't.
[03:53:49.835 --> 03:53:53.457]  But I never say never because, you know, I can't predict the future.
[03:53:53.457 --> 03:53:57.860]  I can't predict if something would happen that would inspire me to do it again.
[03:53:58.360 --> 03:54:07.023]  But right now, I don't have the fire in my belly to go for, like, the Senate race, you know, it really came down to flipping a coin.
[03:54:07.023 --> 03:54:08.463]  I let destiny determine it.
[03:54:08.463 --> 03:54:17.706]  But the other main reason was I thought about, you know, at my age now, that six years of my life, that I gotta go hang out with people I don't even like?
[03:54:20.071 --> 03:54:20.672]  Yeah, they are.
[03:54:39.346 --> 03:54:42.389]  Well, Governor Ventura, I understand, but that's the problem.
[03:54:42.389 --> 03:55:00.264]  Evil people will scrabble and claw to get power, will gnaw through steel to get it, and then good guys like you, they don't want power, so they do something to fight the evil, but then at a certain point get so disgusted by the elitists that they don't even want to get involved with them, and I don't blame you.
[03:55:00.264 --> 03:55:02.846]  If I get that disgusted, you know I'll be back.
[03:55:04.551 --> 03:55:05.171]  Absolutely.
[03:55:05.171 --> 03:55:07.352]  So that's a little hint that you're going to be back in the future.
[03:55:07.352 --> 03:55:09.893]  Well, we'll talk a lot coming up on June 1st.
[03:55:09.893 --> 03:55:14.355]  I just need to get with you and find out exactly what hour of the show you want to come on then.
[03:55:14.355 --> 03:55:17.957]  But Governor Ventura, the book is out in paperback.
[03:55:17.957 --> 03:55:21.439]  In closing, you talk about, on TV, waterboarding Dick Cheney.
[03:55:21.439 --> 03:55:29.982]  I mean, if this guy says it's so great, it's so wonderful, they admit 90 plus percent of the people at Guantanamo Bay, totally innocent, just picked up by bounty hunters.
[03:55:29.982 --> 03:55:30.923]  They get $25,000 a piece, most of them 14, 15.
[03:55:33.584 --> 03:55:44.049]  Well, first of all, I made the quote, I think I said it on The View, that if you, or no, I said it on Larry King, that if you gave me a waterboard Dick Cheney in one hour, I'd have him confessing to the Tate murders.
[03:56:00.841 --> 03:56:03.603]  Well, I have to amend that, though, Alex.
[03:56:03.603 --> 03:56:05.324]  I don't think I could accomplish that.
[03:56:05.324 --> 03:56:06.525]  You know why?
[03:56:06.525 --> 03:56:07.286]  Why?
[03:56:07.286 --> 03:56:08.767]  His heart ain't good enough.
[03:56:08.767 --> 03:56:12.409]  He wouldn't be alive for an hour to even confess.
[03:56:12.409 --> 03:56:13.009]  Exactly.
[03:56:13.009 --> 03:56:19.814]  And that tells you how bad waterboarding is, because I do not believe Dick Cheney physically could take it.
[03:56:20.615 --> 03:56:22.795]  You know, with the heart that he has.
[03:56:22.795 --> 03:56:31.217]  Well, what about the stuff for him to advocate doing this to people, and for calling it another name called enhanced interrogation?
[03:56:31.217 --> 03:56:37.798]  Well, that's baloney, because torture is torture, and they're like jury picking.
[03:56:37.798 --> 03:56:45.920]  They go, well, you can't torture a person from the United States, but if the person comes from somewhere else in the world, torture's okay?
[03:56:45.920 --> 03:56:47.620]  Well, that was my last question.
[03:56:47.620 --> 03:56:48.040]  What about...
[03:56:48.780 --> 03:56:49.761]  Well, that's because you're in Texas.
[03:56:49.761 --> 03:56:50.481]  You can't do nothing in Texas.
[03:57:10.458 --> 03:57:15.282]  No, but what do you think of that DHS report, you know, trying to list the American people as the terrorists?
[03:57:15.282 --> 03:57:21.066]  Well, again, you know, I don't know, Alex, that's only stuff you know.
[03:57:21.066 --> 03:57:28.311]  I can only speak to stuff that, and it's not that I don't believe you, but I can only speak to stuff that I actually know about, and I'll say this.
[03:57:28.311 --> 03:57:30.213]  Yeah, no, you have been down in Mexico, yeah, go ahead.
[03:57:30.213 --> 03:57:37.158]  If we're not vigilant, if we're not vigilant, we're going to lose our freedoms, because it's a natural progression.
[03:57:39.550 --> 03:57:43.212]  If you look down through the annals of history, you will always see it happen.
[03:57:43.212 --> 03:57:48.975]  And unless the citizenry takes control... In fact, let me say this, Alex.
[03:57:48.975 --> 03:57:50.836]  Now, finish like this.
[03:57:50.836 --> 03:57:54.358]  They won't release the photos of our torture, right?
[03:57:54.358 --> 03:57:55.239]  Yes.
[03:57:55.239 --> 03:58:04.163]  Well, then how about if I step forward on behalf of the taxpayers and the citizens of the great United States of America?
[03:58:04.163 --> 03:58:05.704]  And I want to go public with this.
[03:58:05.704 --> 03:58:06.805]  Now, I'll let you break it.
[03:58:08.584 --> 03:58:09.845]  I will represent us.
[03:58:09.845 --> 03:58:12.706]  Let me go where these photos are.
[03:58:12.706 --> 03:58:15.207]  Let me go inside and see them.
[03:58:15.207 --> 03:58:20.269]  And let me come out and report back as to what these photos are.
[03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:22.289]  I think I have the right to do that.
[03:58:22.289 --> 03:58:24.490]  I think they have no right to keep me from that.
[03:58:24.490 --> 03:58:25.711]  You know why?
[03:58:25.711 --> 03:58:26.771]  I pay their salary.
[03:58:27.705 --> 03:58:33.850]  And I'm a governor, I'm a mayor, I'm a former Navy SEAL, I had a top-secret security clearance.
[03:58:33.850 --> 03:58:39.255]  I think I'm fully qualified to walk in and view these photos on behalf of all citizens of the United States.
[03:58:49.997 --> 03:59:01.649]  Yeah, Governor, we had to end the main thing on the MNF, but we've still got tens of thousands on the internet listening, and then I'm going to cut that transmission in a moment and say bye to you off-air, because I want to know where to send something that you were asking for.
[03:59:01.649 --> 03:59:02.670]  But finish your statement.
[03:59:02.670 --> 03:59:05.033]  We're still on the internet and still at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:59:05.033 --> 03:59:12.741]  My statement was, again, I will go on behalf of the American people and let me go view these pictures they won't let us see on torture.
[03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:19.493]  Yeah, you're a governor, and also a populist figure, he's very popular in the polls, that's a good idea.
[03:59:19.493 --> 03:59:34.942]  Let me go in and look at them, and I'll come out and I'll report to the public whether, you know, what it is, why we shouldn't be able to see them, because I understand it could infuriate the enemy, but I'm not the enemy.
[03:59:34.942 --> 03:59:38.844]  And therefore I think I have every right to see these photos in private.
[03:59:39.209 --> 03:59:45.632]  Well, Governor, let me just tell you in closing what is in them, because these photos were seen, as you know, by Congress and members of the Senate.
[03:59:45.632 --> 03:59:48.273]  It is children being raped videos.
[03:59:48.273 --> 03:59:56.117]  It is photos of children being raped in front of their parents, and Obama was going to release some whitewashed ones, and then it was decided those were too hardcore.
[03:59:56.117 --> 04:00:01.460]  But Cy Hirsch, you can just Google Cy Hirsch, New Yorker raping boys.
[04:00:02.220 --> 04:00:29.885]  and uh... or or or interrogations raping children and it is confirmed general to gumbo the american general he's filipino uh... he did the army report three-star general where they said all that was done so we have an army report about those but yeah that would be important to uh... to send you in there but that was the question i was gonna ask that's how bad these crimes get as i told you six months ago when you're here in austin what should be done i mean is i mean is that a pretty bad crime raping kids in front of their parents
[04:00:30.225 --> 04:00:31.626]  Yeah, I would think so.
[04:00:31.626 --> 04:00:38.870]  You know, to me, all torture is a bad crime, but again, I'll reserve comment until I'm allowed to see the photos.
[04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:47.134]  Let me go see what they won't allow us to see, and I'll be happy to come out and give you my opinion on what I saw.
[04:00:47.134 --> 04:00:50.876]  Okay, Governor, the bottom line is this.
[04:00:50.876 --> 04:00:55.579]  If we hadn't done torture in the first place, Alex, there wouldn't be any photos, would there?
[04:00:56.838 --> 04:01:00.501]  Absolutely, and they wouldn't be having to defend torture and say it's okay.
[04:01:00.501 --> 04:01:03.063]  Exactly, and that's the bottom line.
[04:01:03.063 --> 04:01:13.811]  Like when they're attacking Pelosi, that's just a red herring because the bottom line, whether she knew or didn't know, is if the torture hadn't taken place in the first place, it would be irrelevant.
[04:01:14.753 --> 04:01:15.674]  Absolutely, Governor.
[04:01:15.674 --> 04:01:24.301]  Listen, I need to talk to you off air, so let's end the transmission right now on the radio show, and then I will say bye to Governor Ventura.
[04:01:24.301 --> 04:01:28.885]  I just want to know where to send you this atmospheric water generator, because you were saying you wanted to know where to get one.
[04:01:28.885 --> 04:01:30.146]  We'll just mail you one.
[04:01:30.146 --> 04:01:33.910]  So, you know what, let me do this, Governor, so I'll make sure we're not on air.
[04:01:33.910 --> 04:01:35.711]  Let me just call you back on this line right now.
[04:01:35.711 --> 04:01:36.252]  Okay.
[04:01:36.872 --> 04:01:38.113]  Okay, I'll call you in 60 seconds.
[04:01:38.113 --> 04:01:38.674]  All right, I'll hang up.
[04:01:38.674 --> 04:01:41.036]  All right, there goes Governor Jesse Ventura.
[04:01:41.036 --> 04:01:42.897]  All right, we were still transmitting, correct?
[04:01:42.897 --> 04:01:43.618]  Okay, good.
[04:01:43.618 --> 04:01:45.339]  Good way to end that right there.
[04:01:45.339 --> 04:01:47.141]  See you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[04:01:47.141 --> 04:01:50.263]  to 3 p.m., right here on the front lines of the InfoWar.
[04:01:50.263 --> 04:01:54.827]  I'm gonna go send him a bunch of emails and stuff now to fully educate him about the torture.
[04:01:54.827 --> 04:01:58.751]  So when he goes on national TV, he'll talk about what they're doing to kids.
[04:01:58.751 --> 04:02:00.592]  It's all admitted, it's just the public doesn't know.
[04:02:01.854 --> 04:02:03.159]  Alright, that's it for this transmission.
[04:02:03.159 --> 04:02:04.021]  Great job, crew.
[04:02:04.021 --> 04:02:05.045]  Great job, Genesis.
[04:02:05.045 --> 04:02:06.570]  Great job, affiliates.
[04:02:06.570 --> 04:02:07.072]  Take care.
[04:02:07.072 --> 04:02:08.436]  The InfoWar continues right now.
