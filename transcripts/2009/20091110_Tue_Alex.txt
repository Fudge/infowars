[00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:06.957]  Well, Judge Napolitano is our guest today, and I'm very, very excited to have him on.
[00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:11.483]  This is an abbreviated visit, but we're going to get him back on for a full 30 minutes or maybe even an hour.
[00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:14.753]  And he's, of course, from Newark, New Jersey.
[00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:19.676]  He's a tenured Superior Court judge in New Jersey and now an analyst on Fox News Channel.
[00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:27.900]  He has an extremely popular syndicated radio show and has Freedom Watch from Fox News Studios, which is an internet television show.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.422]  And he also is the guest host for Glenn Beck.
[00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:31.843]  I wish he was!
[00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:33.344]  We're good to go.
[00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.322]  Instead of Glenn Beck, 90%.
[00:00:56.582 --> 00:00:58.263]  Because that 10% is a big area.
[00:00:58.603 --> 00:01:12.509]  And so here for about 15 minutes to talk about healthcare, the big government takeover of healthcare, extrajudicial, these boards decide what to do, and to talk about the cap and trade, which I believe has a good chance of passing the Senate.
[00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:15.611]  Both of these are now in orbit, like ICBM.
[00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:24.415]  Space stations about to drop nukes on our Republic and Judge Andrew Napolitano is there fighting it valiantly.
[00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:25.735]  Judge, it's great to have you with us.
[00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:26.996]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:28.257]  It's good to be on with you.
[00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:31.098]  There's so much happening.
[00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:39.942]  What's more important, cap and trade and the total micromanagement of our life by special interests with Al Gore set to make the money or the government takeover of health care?
[00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.343]  Oh boy, that's really a pick-your-poison, Alex.
[00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:47.126]  It's all part of the same big government mentality.
[00:01:47.566 --> 00:02:03.236]  Your kind comments about the piece I wrote was really from a monologue that I gave while filling in for Glenn Beck, which I'm also doing later today at 5 o'clock Eastern, by the way, on Fox News Channel, in which I argued that we don't have a two-party system in this country.
[00:02:03.276 --> 00:02:08.300]  We have one party, one political party called the Big Government Party, the Republican branch
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:20.524]  The Democratic branch likes war and deficits and assaulting our civil liberties, and the Democratic branch likes wealth transfers and taxes and assaulting our commercial liberties.
[00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:22.744]  But the mindset is the same.
[00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:37.609]  The heck with the Constitution, the heck with the Bill of Rights, the heck with inalienable rights, the heck with even the laws that we write, we know what's better for you than what you know is good for yourself and we will tell you how to obey or else.
[00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.570]  Cap and trade is one manifestation of that.
[00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.231]  Obamacare is another manifestation of it.
[00:02:45.592 --> 00:03:07.439]  I was furious last week when I saw that even the Republicans, even so-called conservative Republicans, not Ron Paul, but many in the Republican leadership in the House, introduced Obamacare Light, which basically presumes a federal role in healthcare, of which there is none under the Constitution.
[00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.001]  Tells insurance carriers you can't refuse to cover people because of pre-existing injuries.
[00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:17.363]  That's a very nice thing, but there's no power for the Congress to mandate it.
[00:03:17.643 --> 00:03:20.444]  That's got to come about by the free market.
[00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:23.285]  Bribes the states to change their court system.
[00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:25.026]  So this was all the same mindset of, we in Washington can micromanage the private
[00:03:52.463 --> 00:04:01.788]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest today.
[00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:08.592]  Judge, what you're talking about and reading over the legislation, it's like Groundhog Day but on a bigger scale.
[00:04:08.732 --> 00:04:12.754]  It's Chicago or New York, big city, crime boss,
[00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.711]  A machine doling everything out.
[00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.832]  It's like with the takeover of General Motors.
[00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:32.338]  It even came out in congressional investigations, as you know, because you covered it, that people that gave money to Obama cronies or to the Democratic Party, they got to keep their dealership and got to keep their client list.
[00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:35.119]  But if you didn't, if you'd ever gone against them,
[00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:44.203]  Or hadn't paid the protection money, you lost your dealership, even though some of the dealerships were over 80 years old and made millions of dollars a year.
[00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:51.886]  And so now you have this Tenth Amendment destroying federal power coming in with these unelected panels.
[00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:56.288]  And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:04:56.828 --> 00:04:58.749]  And I fear it can pass the Senate.
[00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:01.670]  I'm hearing some of the Republican leadership saying, oh no, it won't.
[00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.271]  They said it wouldn't pass the House in the last two weeks.
[00:05:04.798 --> 00:05:09.480]  Well, they did say it wouldn't pass the House, and it did pass by a two-vote margin.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.043]  And, you know, you really can't tell with politicians, because the leadership will bribe them.
[00:05:16.103 --> 00:05:22.945]  Remember the first time TARP, the so-called Troubled Asset Relief Program, went through the House, it was defeated.
[00:05:22.965 --> 00:05:34.210]  I remember, I was on the Fox Business Network at the moment, fist in air, just emoting joy, shouting, the beast is dead.
[00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:44.356]  But I was naive because the leadership came back and bribed by, you know, we'll build a courthouse in your district, your friend wants to become a federal judge, he's got it, just vote for us on TARP.
[00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:46.817]  And eventually people changed their vote.
[00:05:47.238 --> 00:05:51.100]  I fear that the same thing will happen with respect to Obamacare, the government.
[00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:52.582]  We're good to go.
[00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:29.127]  Groups throughout the country appointed by local politicians who decided what prices and wages were.
[00:06:29.608 --> 00:06:46.381]  There's a famous case in my home state of New Jersey where an Eastern European immigrant opened up a dry cleaning shop and the local wage and price group declared that you would charge 40 cents to clean and press a man's suit.
[00:06:46.922 --> 00:06:48.423]  This guy charged 35 cents.
[00:06:50.024 --> 00:06:55.468]  Literally a nickel cheaper than what the unelected local board said he could charge.
[00:06:55.788 --> 00:07:10.939]  He was arrested by the FBI, he was indicted by a grand jury, he was put on trial in federal court in Newark, and he served a three-month prison term in a federal prison for charging five cents less than what the local board allowed him to.
[00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.900]  Now, transform that
[00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:15.827]  It's a modern day practice of medicine.
[00:07:16.308 --> 00:07:23.972]  You will have a board of bureaucrats, not even physicians, bureaucrats that will be between you and your physician.
[00:07:24.032 --> 00:07:25.873]  You will lose your privacy.
[00:07:26.253 --> 00:07:42.203]  You will lose the freedom of choice because the bureaucratic board will give your physician a list of diagnostic tools that she or he can use to address your ailment and then a list of procedures and medicines that she or he can prescribe.
[00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:43.344]  And that's all in there.
[00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.265]  To war.
[00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:21.011]  You talk about the Republicans want endless war and the Democrats want to nanny-state you together to death.
[00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:22.252]  But look at Obama.
[00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:24.734]  He's increased troops before in Afghanistan.
[00:08:24.974 --> 00:08:29.378]  He's now saying he's going to send 40,000 more in that we're never going to leave.
[00:08:29.398 --> 00:08:33.542]  There's over 300,000 international and Afghan troops there now.
[00:08:34.243 --> 00:08:37.806]  I see absolutely no difference between the parties, just different rhetoric.
[00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:41.318]  I must reluctantly agree with you.
[00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:44.119]  I say reluctantly, not because I don't like to agree with you.
[00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:45.259]  I do.
[00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:53.062]  But because I was naively expecting that we would not see this kind of build-up under him that we saw under George W. Bush.
[00:08:53.082 --> 00:08:53.742]  But think about it.
[00:08:53.802 --> 00:08:55.323]  War is the health of the state.
[00:08:56.263 --> 00:09:07.627]  When we fight a war, people will look the other way when their taxes are raised and when the government takes away their freedom, because they accept the illusion that by fighting the war, the government is somehow keeping them safe.
[00:09:08.227 --> 00:09:13.813]  Presidents love war because it lets them escape the confines of the Constitution.
[00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:16.176]  It lets them become a little bit of a prince.
[00:09:16.576 --> 00:09:25.526]  It even causes judges sometimes, if the president does something under the guise of war-making, to look the other way and defer to the executive branch.
[00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:29.791]  Fortunately, the Supreme Court did not do that under Bush years, under the Bush years.
[00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:45.056]  Every single time his war-making powers were challenged in the courts and made its way to the Supreme Court of the United States, he was zero and six before a Supreme Court that was appointed largely by Republicans.
[00:09:45.296 --> 00:09:46.377]  Judge, were you surprised?
[00:09:46.397 --> 00:10:02.351]  I don't want you to rely on the Supreme Court to save us because their lives are in your hands and you don't know which way they're going to go and because it takes too long for the issue to get to them and too much harm can happen between the time presidents wage war and the time their war powers are challenged in the courts.
[00:10:02.981 --> 00:10:19.047]  Were you surprised that Obama flip-flopped so strongly and went from being anti-patriot act to zealously defending it, wanting to expand it, and complete warrantless wiretapping, complete secret arrest, complete... I mean, he's going further than Bush on the police state.
[00:10:19.087 --> 00:10:20.107]  I didn't think that was possible.
[00:10:20.427 --> 00:10:24.368]  I didn't think it was possible either, and I was absolutely crushed when I heard it.
[00:10:24.808 --> 00:10:36.370]  He obviously was not my candidate of choice, but I took a little bit of internal intellectual solace in the fact that at least we were getting a president who would respect the Constitution.
[00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.471]  How wrong I was.
[00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:43.392]  His disrespect for the Constitution may not be couched in as harsh
[00:10:43.972 --> 00:10:45.333]  Well, I've talked to a lot of...
[00:11:03.385 --> 00:11:03.785]  Exactly.
[00:11:03.845 --> 00:11:07.886]  I've talked to a lot of lawyers and judges, and I wanted to briefly see if you agree.
[00:11:08.687 --> 00:11:25.672]  Even though a lot of conservatives didn't like Obama, true paleo-conservatives, libertarian types like Ron Paul and yourself, because he is a constitutional lawyer and practiced it for 10 years as a professor, people expected that Obama would try to, at least on the surface, restore some of the Bill of Rights.
[00:11:25.712 --> 00:11:28.632]  But instead, you know, he's saying, Constitution?
[00:11:28.673 --> 00:11:30.013]  It's just a GD piece of paper.
[00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:35.719]  I too expected that he would show more respect for the Constitution.
[00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:39.662]  I read some of the lectures he gave at the University of Chicago Law School.
[00:11:40.002 --> 00:11:48.107]  I could have given some of those lectures myself when I taught Constitutional Law at Seton Hall Law School in Newark and at Delaware Law School in Wilmington, Delaware.
[00:11:48.947 --> 00:12:09.882]  But, you know, something happens when you don the mantle of power, and that something is a disdain for the restraint on your power, a disdain for the natural law, a respect that we have natural rights beyond which no government can go, a disdain for the Constitution itself, a disdain for our inalienable rights, same as natural rights, and a disdain for the Bill of Rights.
[00:12:10.182 --> 00:12:13.244]  They just simply don't care.
[00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:17.227]  They will steal from the rich to give to the poor to create
[00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:20.228]  Well said.
[00:12:20.248 --> 00:12:22.668]  Final question.
[00:12:23.088 --> 00:12:35.150]  I'm going to let you go because I know you've got to fill in.
[00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.370]  Guest host for Glenn Beck tonight.
[00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:41.911]  Congratulations on your huge success as your star rises because you're the bonafide constitutionalist.
[00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:44.712]  We really, really appreciate you, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:12:45.572 --> 00:12:46.532]  But in closing,
[00:12:48.027 --> 00:12:54.750]  I would like to get you to comment, A, on just how special George Washington and Andrew Jackson were.
[00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.551]  They got all this power and then did give it up.
[00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:59.352]  They wanted George Washington to be a king.
[00:13:00.512 --> 00:13:11.957]  These were amazing founding fathers we had, and what would they think of what's happening today where NOAA Satellite Information Service, the federal government, admits the coldest
[00:13:12.837 --> 00:13:19.499]  Winner so far in the last 50 years, the third coldest in the last hundred.
[00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:27.541]  Meanwhile, they're openly announcing that they're going to list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste and tax it when humans exhale it.
[00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:36.683]  Can you end with speaking about our founders compared to the material we've got in Washington today and what they would think of taxing what plants breathe?
[00:13:37.837 --> 00:13:41.659]  The founders tried to do two things with the Constitution.
[00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:51.924]  One was to create a federal government strong enough to protect us from invasion and to do national type things like run a post office and make sure that there is trade between the states.
[00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:56.867]  The other was to restrain the federal government so that it wouldn't interfere with our personal liberties.
[00:13:57.287 --> 00:14:13.215]  They specifically gave us a constitution that kept the federal government away from any type of relationship with individuals because they knew that the greatest threat to freedom comes not from your enemy on the outside who you can see and look at,
[00:14:13.815 --> 00:14:20.298]  But from the smiling face of the government on the inside, who claims that it's going to take care of you.
[00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:26.461]  And presidents like George Washington, whose closest advisor, Alexander Hamilton, wanted him to be king.
[00:14:26.882 --> 00:14:37.627]  And Andrew Jackson, who basically said to the Supreme Court, you know, they've gone ahead and made their federal bank, let them find the money and put the deposits in the federal bank.
[00:14:38.007 --> 00:14:49.135]  These were people who understood that there were natural limits on what government can do and written limits on what the federal government can do, and they stuck to those limits.
[00:14:49.615 --> 00:15:07.288]  The present government and its predecessors, you know, from Lincoln to Wilson to FDR to George W. Bush to Barack Obama, have so distorted out of proportion what the federal government is to do that the founders would not recognize it at all and would probably want to take up arms against it.
[00:15:08.203 --> 00:15:10.044]  What are you covering tonight and then we'll let you go.
[00:15:10.064 --> 00:15:14.305]  I hope you're going to be covering the health care and cap and trade because... That's exactly what we're talking about.
[00:15:14.325 --> 00:15:15.646]  We're talking about health care.
[00:15:15.686 --> 00:15:18.647]  We're talking about the state of the economy.
[00:15:19.067 --> 00:15:33.073]  We're talking about the government subpoenaing media entities wanting to know who earns how much money because they have to decide whose income taxes to audit next.
[00:15:33.613 --> 00:15:34.194]  You're kidding!
[00:15:34.214 --> 00:15:45.382]  Wait a minute, they're not just... The federal government is subpoenaing media people to... They're subpoenaing media companies to find out who earns what and what their social security numbers are.
[00:15:45.722 --> 00:15:51.006]  This is getting so bad, so quickly, far worse than any of us imagined.
[00:15:51.406 --> 00:15:56.150]  And the present president hasn't even celebrated his first year in office yet.
[00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.310]  Well, since you brought that up...
[00:15:58.251 --> 00:15:59.952]  Since you brought that up, let me just ask you now.
[00:16:00.912 --> 00:16:05.255]  Senator Lamar Alexander's gone to the floor and talked about he's confirmed there's an enemies list.
[00:16:05.995 --> 00:16:08.676]  He warned him and said, look, I work for Nixon.
[00:16:08.756 --> 00:16:09.617]  Don't do this.
[00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:13.439]  It's been reported I am on the enemies list.
[00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:14.759]  I'm going from memory.
[00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:15.720]  I think you are, too.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:16.820]  But what is it?
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.441]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:22.703]  It is scary to know that there's a real enemies list.
[00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:25.965]  And this is I mean, is this not illegal, Judge?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:35.484]  Well, it's illegal for the president to compile a list of people who disagree with him on the basis of their political opinions and their outspoken words.
[00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:43.909]  That was specifically written into the privacy law in 1974, enacted and signed into law by President Ford shortly after
[00:16:44.409 --> 00:16:44.669]  I think so.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.523]  Well, I tell you, it's scary, and everybody should pray for the people that are on that list, myself included.
[00:17:07.263 --> 00:17:11.986]  Judge, what's the best website for people to visit to find out about all things Judge Napolitano?
[00:17:12.386 --> 00:17:23.553]  Well, they can go to foxnews.com, where my Freedom Watch appears, as do my monologues when I fill in for Glenn, as do many of my op-eds.
[00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:27.216]  And, Alex, I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed being on with you.
[00:17:27.616 --> 00:17:30.918]  I hope we get to do this a lot more in the future.
[00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.230]  Absolutely.
[00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.311]  Thank you, Judge.
[00:17:33.451 --> 00:17:33.891]  Take care.
[00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:35.012]  Have a great weekend coming up.
[00:17:35.492 --> 00:17:36.013]  You as well.
[00:17:36.733 --> 00:17:37.874]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:37.914 --> 00:17:40.635]  It's Wednesday, but I'm already thinking about the weekend because I'm going deer hunting.
[00:17:41.156 --> 00:17:41.616]  All right.
[00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:44.558]  Yeah, you go get your hamburger out of the drive-through window.
[00:17:44.578 --> 00:17:45.178]  That's okay.
[00:17:45.238 --> 00:17:46.179]  I'm able to go hunting.
[00:17:47.847 --> 00:17:56.952]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:17:56.992 --> 00:18:00.134]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:18:00.354 --> 00:18:06.058]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:10.720]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:13.362]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:18:13.642 --> 00:18:22.707]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[00:18:22.827 --> 00:18:28.230]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[00:18:48.276 --> 00:18:51.197]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:18:53.183 --> 00:18:53.503]  I think so.

[00:20:43.165 --> 00:20:44.245]  Riders on the storm.
[00:20:44.265 --> 00:20:45.526]  Into this house we're born.
[00:21:07.608 --> 00:21:17.171]  Coming up, we've got the clip of George Soros, Obama puppet master, calls for carbon taxes and New World Order on PBS.
[00:21:20.072 --> 00:21:24.093]  That is coming up later in the broadcast today.
[00:21:24.293 --> 00:21:28.914]  General Stubblebine's joining us, along with his medical doctor wife, Dr. Rayma Labo.
[00:21:29.555 --> 00:21:30.975]  Going to be extremely informative.
[00:21:34.329 --> 00:21:40.812]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is anti-war, anti-Patriot Act, anti-New World Order, anti-carbon tax.
[00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:44.634]  He's almost as good as Ron Paul on the issues.
[00:21:45.974 --> 00:21:49.976]  And Fox uses him like you use a little cayenne pepper and chili.
[00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:53.057]  They just throw a little bit of it in there.
[00:21:53.558 --> 00:21:55.459]  And I like the fact that he's on more and more.
[00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:59.720]  And I've talked to him off air, talked to him privately, read his columns for years.
[00:22:00.021 --> 00:22:00.721]  He's a good guy.
[00:22:03.038 --> 00:22:08.886]  I don't like coming out and attacking Beck, because I know he's fooled a lot of people and it turns folks off, but I have to tell the truth.
[00:22:10.188 --> 00:22:16.017]  And if Beck will stop stabbing us in the back, and stop going sideways on issues, I'll support him!
[00:22:17.984 --> 00:22:31.255]  The issue here is the owner, Rupert Murdoch, admits that he's supporting the global carbon tax and is invested in it and has all of his movies and dramas and non-Fox News shows promoting it.
[00:22:31.396 --> 00:22:35.319]  In fact, call Paul Watson, because I couldn't find it this morning.
[00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:36.840]  He wrote an article about it two years ago.
[00:22:38.742 --> 00:22:44.046]  It has the Rupert Murdoch bragging, look at how I'm propagandizing, I'm proud of myself.
[00:22:44.955 --> 00:22:50.356]  It's the montage of Fox TV programs that Fox put out where they're promoting the global techs.
[00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:55.117]  You see, you won't hear Napolitano or these guys talk about that.
[00:22:56.418 --> 00:23:05.880]  Look, I'm not stupid, and I'm not going to get into any details, but I could certainly go, if I played my cards right, go join Team Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.901]  I wasn't ever offered a job by them, but I was offered jobs by people affiliated with them years ago.
[00:23:13.168 --> 00:23:14.829]  I told him, no way, okay?
[00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:16.649]  I'm going to fight the new world order.
[00:23:17.589 --> 00:23:27.232]  But I think we should recognize that Fox is beginning to be forced, because the audience has gone there, to speak out against world government.
[00:23:28.553 --> 00:23:34.775]  Because all these years, Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage and all these guys said there's no new world order.
[00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:36.295]  Glenn Beck said there was no new world order.
[00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:41.737]  Now, it's openly being announced we're in a world government by the people that are pro-world government.
[00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.771]  And so they look pretty stupid.
[00:23:46.272 --> 00:23:55.761]  And so they've got to bring somebody along, like Andrew Napolitano, who's been good the entire time, to not just keep their audience, but grow.
[00:23:55.981 --> 00:24:00.825]  Fox is growing their audience, while CNN, CNBC, all the rest of them are imploding.
[00:24:01.866 --> 00:24:03.627]  And that's because Fox isn't stupid.
[00:24:04.428 --> 00:24:08.892]  They are going anti-New World Order, at least to a certain degree.
[00:24:11.598 --> 00:24:16.262]  Well, we're going all the way anti-New World Order, and we always have, and that's who we are.
[00:24:16.883 --> 00:24:19.845]  But I get emails going, well, why are you having Judge Andrew Napolitano on?
[00:24:19.885 --> 00:24:20.746]  He's on with Fox.
[00:24:21.406 --> 00:24:23.088]  He's telling the truth when he's on Fox.
[00:24:23.749 --> 00:24:30.935]  We need to support people inside the mainstream media that are getting the truth out, while understanding the larger picture.
[00:24:33.177 --> 00:24:35.579]  Before we go to break and come back with Governor Jesse Ventura,
[00:24:37.128 --> 00:24:39.955]  I just want to finish making the point we must take over the system.
[00:24:40.316 --> 00:24:45.589]  We must get the power and then reestablish our constitutional republic as
[00:24:48.484 --> 00:24:53.389]  Many people have said, like G. Edward Griffin, who's in this film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:54.831]  He makes those points.
[00:24:55.211 --> 00:25:03.419]  Fall of the Republic shatters the left-right paradigm, shows you how both sides are controlled, and shows people who the globalists are and what their master plan is.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.163]  Get Fall of the Republic at Infowars.com.

[00:25:25.008 --> 00:25:26.710]  Governor Jesse Ventura, straight ahead.
[00:25:29.273 --> 00:25:32.676]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:25:32.696 --> 00:25:34.799]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:41.474]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:25:41.774 --> 00:25:45.857]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:25:46.118 --> 00:25:51.542]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:25:51.882 --> 00:25:52.303]  It's true.
[00:25:52.603 --> 00:25:58.047]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:01.590]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:26:01.891 --> 00:26:06.374]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:26:06.614 --> 00:26:08.976]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:26:09.377 --> 00:26:12.699]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.744]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:26:17.964 --> 00:26:22.748]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:26:23.028 --> 00:26:27.052]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:26:27.212 --> 00:26:28.773]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:26:40.453 --> 00:26:42.394]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:42.854 --> 00:26:45.755]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:52.298 --> 00:26:52.939]  Big Brother.
[00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:54.640]  Mainstream media.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.480]  Government cover-ups.
[00:26:57.121 --> 00:26:57.941]  You want answers?
[00:26:58.701 --> 00:26:59.642]  Well, so does he.
[00:26:59.662 --> 00:27:03.924]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:04.444 --> 00:27:08.506]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:10.017 --> 00:27:16.601]  Well, we're into our number two simulcasting the syndicated radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Color.
[00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:28.548]  Joining us from Minnesota, he's about to travel down to Mexico to do some surfing, is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, of course a star of films like
[00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:32.432]  The Running Man, Predator, and many other films.
[00:27:32.932 --> 00:27:36.556]  He's hosted a MSNBC national television show.
[00:27:37.237 --> 00:27:39.179]  He's hosted NFL football.
[00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:41.361]  There's not much this guy hadn't done.
[00:27:41.782 --> 00:27:43.323]  And now he's got a huge show.
[00:27:43.343 --> 00:27:45.566]  They're saying it's going to be their big push in the winter.
[00:27:45.886 --> 00:27:47.388]  Their big number one promoted show.
[00:27:47.428 --> 00:27:49.169]  And I'm seeing that now in the media.
[00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.192]  Hi Alex, great to be here again.
[00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:53.713]  I guess I should call you Huggy Bear.
[00:28:21.212 --> 00:28:22.933]  And I'll explain that for a moment.
[00:28:22.973 --> 00:28:25.213]  Now, Alex has been good enough.
[00:28:25.794 --> 00:28:29.895]  He appears in a couple of the episodes of Conspiracy Theory that we did.
[00:28:29.995 --> 00:28:40.058]  And so, because he's the only really reoccurring character we've ever had in the first initial bite, we went back to the old Starsky and Hutch show.
[00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:42.139]  And y'all remember Huggy Bear, don't you?
[00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:45.100]  The guy that always brought the information to Starsky and Hutch?
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.040]  Well, that's you now, Alex.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.241]  So you're our Huggy Bear.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.321]  Well, I'm honored to be your huggy bear.
[00:28:53.883 --> 00:28:56.265]  You've not been able to talk about the show till now.
[00:28:56.305 --> 00:28:57.886]  They've unleashed you.
[00:28:57.926 --> 00:29:01.589]  You barely talked about it on Larry King Live last week.
[00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:11.657]  But now you've been given the green light to give people a foretaste or an idea of what's going to be in the seven episodes.
[00:29:11.957 --> 00:29:13.399]  And so we're all ears, Governor.
[00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:14.820]  I mean, tell us about some of the episodes.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:27.550]  Well, first of all, when I went on Larry, it was because, you know, it was election night and Larry truly wanted my opinion on the latest off-year elections, which I'll do this right now.
[00:29:28.191 --> 00:29:30.873]  To me, why do we even have off-year elections?
[00:29:30.933 --> 00:29:33.075]  It's hard enough to get people out there to vote.
[00:29:33.955 --> 00:29:35.276]  Have them all on here.
[00:29:35.496 --> 00:29:40.801]  They do that so that they get a small voter turnout because it's easier to control small numbers.
[00:29:41.508 --> 00:29:42.089]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:30:01.285 --> 00:30:04.166]  Hold on, we're about to go to break and I want
[00:30:18.172 --> 00:30:18.973]  I don't want to stop you.
[00:30:18.993 --> 00:30:34.906]  I want you to have free flow and go over as much as you can tell us about the episodes because I've consulted some but I still only have a few pieces of the overall puzzle and I know that you've stated that you believe this is fair and from our perspective probably the first television show ever that's actually from
[00:30:35.546 --> 00:30:37.087]  People who questions perspective.
[00:30:37.107 --> 00:30:41.169]  That doesn't mean that you or I or anybody buys all of what's being said out there.
[00:30:41.189 --> 00:30:43.671]  So I want to talk about that when we come back in just a minute.
[00:30:43.711 --> 00:30:51.515]  But in the one minute we've got, what is your take on Republicans sweeping all over the country and Obama's plunging approval rating?
[00:30:52.136 --> 00:30:55.278]  Well, I don't think it's so much Republicans sweeping.
[00:30:56.159 --> 00:31:03.144]  As you know, they lost that congressional race up in that heavily Republican district in New York that hadn't gone Democrat.
[00:31:03.184 --> 00:31:04.865]  Yeah, but the Democrats threw that.
[00:31:04.905 --> 00:31:05.505]  They threw that.
[00:31:05.545 --> 00:31:07.347]  I mean, they had their... Well, maybe so.
[00:31:07.607 --> 00:31:10.329]  Well, to me, the elections are truly irrelevant.
[00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:15.973]  And as far as Obama's ratings falling, that's a natural occurrence.
[00:31:16.373 --> 00:31:21.377]  You know, I don't want to throw water on the fire or anything for those people, you know, for whatever reason.
[00:31:22.477 --> 00:31:25.720]  I, at one time, had 72% approval ratings.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.765]  Well, certainly by the time you get out of office, mine actually dipped below 50 later.
[00:31:32.125 --> 00:31:32.866]  No, no, you're right.
[00:31:33.386 --> 00:31:43.534]  When you have to make hard decisions, when you make those hard decisions, some people aren't going to like it, and a lot of people are one-issue people.
[00:31:43.574 --> 00:31:45.136]  Jesse, we got him right.
[00:31:45.476 --> 00:31:46.016]  We got him right.
[00:31:46.036 --> 00:31:46.537]  Stay right there.
[00:31:47.017 --> 00:31:47.538]  Let's finish that up.
[00:32:04.099 --> 00:32:10.045]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:32:10.385 --> 00:32:14.249]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:32:14.469 --> 00:32:19.834]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:32:20.074 --> 00:32:21.895]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:32:22.155 --> 00:32:23.535]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:32:23.915 --> 00:32:26.156]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:32:26.436 --> 00:32:30.798]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:34.539]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:32:34.859 --> 00:32:37.500]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.421]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:32:39.881 --> 00:32:42.002]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:32:48.183 --> 00:32:51.827]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:51.847 --> 00:32:55.230]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:55.450 --> 00:33:00.234]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:33:00.254 --> 00:33:06.520]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.883]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:33:09.423 --> 00:33:09.703]  Tim Geithner?
[00:33:09.723 --> 00:33:10.143]  Bernanke?
[00:33:10.223 --> 00:33:10.984]  They're arsonists!
[00:33:11.024 --> 00:33:12.164]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:33:12.184 --> 00:33:14.425]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:33:28.311 --> 00:33:32.256]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:33:32.696 --> 00:33:35.299]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:33:46.772 --> 00:33:55.897]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:33:55.937 --> 00:33:59.059]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:05.002]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[00:34:05.162 --> 00:34:09.664]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:34:09.945 --> 00:34:12.286]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:34:12.566 --> 00:34:21.651]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[00:34:21.751 --> 00:34:27.175]  He also recommends ZeoLife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[00:34:57.409 --> 00:34:58.209]  You want answers?
[00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.871]  Well, so does he.
[00:34:59.911 --> 00:35:04.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:08.818]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:15.283]  Well, surf's up, ladies and gentlemen, and here comes Jesse Ventura into the Info Warb.
[00:35:16.344 --> 00:35:19.827]  Coming up in early December, the launch of his long-awaited
[00:35:21.926 --> 00:35:24.587]  Television show, Conspiracy Theory on True TV.
[00:35:24.627 --> 00:35:28.928]  Here to tell us dates and times and inside details, first on this radio show.
[00:35:29.348 --> 00:35:34.630]  When Jesse called me back Friday evening and said, OK, I'll do your show first, I was extremely honored.
[00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.271]  And so Governor, I really do appreciate you coming here first to talk about it.
[00:35:39.351 --> 00:35:40.592]  I know the media blitz starts.
[00:35:41.112 --> 00:35:42.694]  Later today and tomorrow.
[00:35:57.682 --> 00:36:00.824]  Yeah, that's true, Alex, but it's gonna happen, you know.
[00:36:00.904 --> 00:36:02.344]  The honeymoon wears off.
[00:36:02.364 --> 00:36:04.305]  The hard decisions have to be made.
[00:36:04.866 --> 00:36:10.508]  People many times disagree with those tough decisions, and your approval rating starts to fall.
[00:36:10.788 --> 00:36:13.950]  The positive for me, the way I always looked at it, was like this.
[00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.592]  I was in a three-way race, not a two-way race.
[00:36:18.412 --> 00:36:21.053]  I won with only 37 percent.
[00:36:21.553 --> 00:36:28.375]  So even if my approval save fell all the way to 45, that was still 8 points higher than what I won with.
[00:36:29.536 --> 00:36:35.718]  Sure, and George W. Bush's went from 92 to 39, but again that took 7... He had to have been lower than 39.
[00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:42.354]  Yeah, some approval ratings had him at 25.
[00:36:42.554 --> 00:36:43.435]  I mean, there's so many polls.
[00:36:43.455 --> 00:36:46.737]  Well, I would guess he would try with the hardcore Republicans.
[00:36:46.757 --> 00:36:51.722]  In the end, I can't see him even getting over 30% approval rating.
[00:36:52.162 --> 00:36:55.085]  Well, I know Congress... That's just a political gift from his party.
[00:36:56.272 --> 00:36:56.673]  Exactly.
[00:36:56.733 --> 00:37:03.402]  I know that the overall Congress, both parties, had an 11% when he left office, and it's now going back down that direction again.
[00:37:03.462 --> 00:37:11.814]  My point is, Obama's approval rating has broken records, according to the major pollsters, for falling the fastest in the first year of a new administration.
[00:37:12.455 --> 00:37:15.456]  And now he's losing his base.
[00:37:15.576 --> 00:37:21.339]  CBS News last night reported he is putting in 40,000 more troops in Afghanistan.
[00:37:21.379 --> 00:37:24.360]  And Jesse, I know you've researched this and are well-read on this subject.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.561]  Let's talk about this right now and then get into the show.
[00:37:27.521 --> 00:37:40.126]  There's 12 times the opium, 12 times coming out of Afghanistan, of what was coming out 8 years ago, and even the BBC admits our troops are guarding the opium so, quote, the Taliban doesn't get it.
[00:37:40.226 --> 00:37:44.028]  No, that's so the banks can launder $500 billion in smack every year.
[00:37:44.348 --> 00:37:46.029]  Governor Ventura, your take on this war?
[00:37:46.049 --> 00:37:50.831]  Well, to me, welcome in my lifetime now.
[00:37:50.871 --> 00:37:52.151]  How wonderful it is.
[00:37:52.211 --> 00:37:53.832]  Welcome to another Vietnam.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.261]  It's that simple.
[00:37:57.721 --> 00:37:59.523]  It's going to accomplish nothing.
[00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:04.648]  Guys are going to die over there on a constant basis, as they have in Iraq.
[00:38:05.488 --> 00:38:07.690]  And, you know, welcome to another Vietnam.
[00:38:08.351 --> 00:38:13.736]  When this is all over and done with, I do it right now, Alex.
[00:38:13.836 --> 00:38:20.162]  I sit back and go, how is Jesse Ventura benefiting from these two wars?
[00:38:21.323 --> 00:38:22.584]  And I can't think of a thing.
[00:38:23.428 --> 00:38:29.451]  And yet, we've got people out there protesting whether people should be able to go see a doctor or not.
[00:38:30.031 --> 00:38:35.314]  If we wouldn't have fought these two wars, we'd have plenty of money for healthcare, wouldn't we?
[00:38:37.452 --> 00:38:38.793]  Absolutely!
[00:38:39.133 --> 00:38:47.039]  And my point is, wars are the most destructive thing mankind can do.
[00:38:47.779 --> 00:38:51.002]  And when he engages in them, it has no benefit.
[00:38:51.402 --> 00:39:02.049]  It's like Herman Goering said, the best thing a farmer can get out of a war is to be able to come back on the same farm he left before the war started.
[00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:03.450]  That's the best outcome.
[00:39:03.751 --> 00:39:04.691]  The very best.
[00:39:05.112 --> 00:39:06.873]  There will be nothing more than that.
[00:39:07.964 --> 00:39:10.005]  And when is this country going to wake up?
[00:39:11.826 --> 00:39:12.206]  You know?
[00:39:12.486 --> 00:39:14.647]  I sit back and I'm appalled.
[00:39:15.547 --> 00:39:18.908]  I can't say I'm speechless because I'm bitching about it right now.
[00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:23.410]  But I cannot believe that people aren't protesting these wars.
[00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:27.051]  And now we're sending more troops in to accomplish what?
[00:39:28.392 --> 00:39:35.755]  The Russians couldn't win more and we're so stupid and our ego is so powerful that we think we can?
[00:39:37.932 --> 00:39:56.232]  Well, they can't win the state of objective to bring democracy and freedom to Afghanistan, but if the objective is to destabilize the region and have bases to menace Iran and China, and if the state of objective, you know, the real objective is to launder drug proceeds, then it's mission accomplished.
[00:39:56.272 --> 00:39:57.414]  They just need to sit there.
[00:39:57.714 --> 00:40:02.137]  If that's indeed what it is, Alex, then you will be—you're absolutely correct.
[00:40:02.217 --> 00:40:03.318]  It's mission accomplished.
[00:40:03.398 --> 00:40:09.242]  If that's what they're accomplishing out of this, I can't prove that that's what they are or aren't doing at this time.
[00:40:09.802 --> 00:40:21.811]  But certainly from a base perspective of Jesse Ventura, American citizen, I don't understand how I benefit by these words one bit or any of the rest of us benefit by them one bit.
[00:40:22.256 --> 00:40:24.358]  Okay, here's an example, then we'll get into the TV show.
[00:40:24.638 --> 00:40:24.858]  Sure.
[00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:30.644]  I know you've been busy with, you know, producing the television show and flying all over the country, and we'll talk about that.
[00:40:30.684 --> 00:40:32.005]  You are really working hard on this.
[00:40:32.045 --> 00:40:34.407]  A lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of energy, a lot of money.
[00:40:38.266 --> 00:40:57.142]  But at the same time, it came out two weeks ago, New York Times, that Mohammed Karzai's brother is the head opium kingpin in Afghanistan, and that he is a CIA operative on CIA payroll, and that basically so is Mohammed Karzai, and that our troops are guarding his poppy fields.
[00:40:57.703 --> 00:41:04.449]  And I was driving down the road a few months ago and heard BBC report the same thing before the New York Times did, and I already knew that.
[00:41:05.393 --> 00:41:13.561]  But to hear them report that, oh, we guard the opium because if we don't guard it, another Taliban group will get it and then they'll get too much power.
[00:41:13.581 --> 00:41:14.943]  That's what they're telling the troops.
[00:41:15.023 --> 00:41:16.524]  We guard the opium to win the war.
[00:41:16.765 --> 00:41:18.687]  You know the CIA got caught with opium in...
[00:41:20.399 --> 00:41:22.000]  In Southeast Asia and Vietnam.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.201]  We're now in Colombia putting bases in.
[00:41:24.601 --> 00:41:36.367]  Anywhere there's drugs, our troops are there to eradicate the other guy's drugs and protect the drug kingpins that launder their money through US and European banks.
[00:41:36.887 --> 00:41:46.592]  And add to that the fact that that's how the CIA gets their revenue so that they can then do operations that they can keep away from Congress.
[00:41:47.518 --> 00:41:58.280]  Because if they have to do operations that require them to get money from our tax money, then they have to be forward enough to let Congress know what they're doing with the money.
[00:41:58.841 --> 00:42:14.324]  But if they're getting money via illegal drugs and making all sorts of money out of that end of the world, they then don't have to declare any of that to Congress, and that's when they can do these dirty jobs that the American public will never know about.
[00:42:15.151 --> 00:42:18.553]  Governor Jesse Ventura, that is the nail on the head.
[00:42:18.693 --> 00:42:19.333]  Absolutely.
[00:42:19.413 --> 00:42:20.734]  I hadn't even thought to make that point.
[00:42:21.294 --> 00:42:29.738]  All those tens of billions in unaccountable money that these private... That's how they run their operations so that they don't have to be accountable to the Congress.
[00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:31.820]  Absolutely.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:42.445]  In fact, in 96, that came out on C-SPAN with the CIA Inspector General testifying that the CIA brought in the crack cocaine epidemic.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.321]  Well, that I don't know.
[00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:49.222]  You know about that, Alex.
[00:42:49.322 --> 00:42:49.782]  I don't.
[00:42:49.882 --> 00:42:51.823]  I can only speak to what I know about.
[00:42:51.923 --> 00:42:56.446]  And, you know, you're better well read on it than I am.
[00:42:57.588 --> 00:43:03.192]  Well no, I mean, you know as much or more than I do, you just brought up the key point that they're funding their black operations with this.
[00:43:03.212 --> 00:43:09.597]  Oh yeah, no, I've felt that and known that for a long, long time, that that's the simple way to do it.
[00:43:09.637 --> 00:43:11.658]  That's how you keep it out of the public eye.
[00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:18.704]  That's how you can get money to do political assassinations like in the old days when they used to attempt to kill Castro.
[00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:28.405]  If they do that, if they get money from Congress, then they have to submit reports and it has to be far more above board.
[00:43:28.945 --> 00:43:39.990]  But if they get the money from somewhere else, which can be dirty drug money, well then they can spend it on any operations they want to do and they don't have to be accountable to the American public or the Congress for it.
[00:43:41.101 --> 00:43:41.601]  Absolutely.
[00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:45.284]  Governor, we've got you here to talk about the TV show, so I'm going to stop getting off on other issues.
[00:43:45.324 --> 00:43:51.648]  I apologize, but it's always interesting to hear your truthful perspective, because you're absolutely right on those issues.
[00:43:53.029 --> 00:43:54.770]  Where to start with the TV show?
[00:43:55.150 --> 00:44:02.135]  I mean, I've seen the one promo clip where you went out to harp, and they threatened to arrest you, and then suddenly the equipment went dead.
[00:44:03.356 --> 00:44:06.498]  Let's go through the seven episodes and give people an idea of what's coming up.
[00:44:06.858 --> 00:44:09.799]  Well, hopefully I can remember them all.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:17.503]  I'll tell you, it was so hectic shooting them that sometimes I had to jump from one episode to another episode.
[00:44:18.384 --> 00:44:28.548]  And that plays games with your mind because you're focused in on one thing and then, you know, the next half a day you might be doing something for a completely different episode.
[00:44:28.729 --> 00:44:29.689]  Let me ask this.
[00:44:30.149 --> 00:44:31.270]  What's your favorite episode?
[00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.251]  I would say my favorite one would be 9-11.
[00:44:36.374 --> 00:44:48.301]  Because I think 9-11 was the original one that I took to the two TV people to sell them on the show, and so it was personal to me because of my investigation of it so far.
[00:44:48.862 --> 00:44:54.465]  So I would have to say that that one is the most satisfying, although they all are, pretty much.
[00:44:54.505 --> 00:44:56.346]  And I'll put it to you this way.
[00:44:56.386 --> 00:44:59.188]  The way that I'm going to explain it is quite simple, Alex.
[00:44:59.748 --> 00:45:06.371]  People can choose to believe the conspiracies or not, all seven of these, and they're all fairly modern day.
[00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:15.596]  The one thing True Channel wanted to do, we don't go back to Kennedy, we don't go back, they wanted to keep this first series within the last decade, pretty much.
[00:45:16.436 --> 00:45:24.700]  And you can choose to believe them or you can choose not to believe them, but I'll guarantee you this, if you watch the show, you're going to get scared.
[00:45:26.912 --> 00:45:33.815]  Even if they're not true, there is still the element that they may be, they might be, and they could be.
[00:45:35.656 --> 00:45:36.696]  And maybe they are.
[00:45:37.496 --> 00:45:40.157]  And that should be enough to wake people up and scare them.
[00:45:40.598 --> 00:45:44.639]  This is the first show that I've ever done in my career where I got scared.
[00:45:45.179 --> 00:45:46.540]  And I don't get scared easy.
[00:45:48.214 --> 00:45:55.198]  I remember a few weeks ago, I ran into you and we were checking in at the hotel, and you walked up and you were shaking your head and you said, Alex.
[00:45:55.818 --> 00:45:59.120]  You were there with your son Tyrell, who's working on the show as well, doing a great job.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.342]  You walked up and you said, Alex, when I go to bed at night, my head's spinning with all this information.
[00:46:04.402 --> 00:46:05.383]  This stuff is scary.
[00:46:05.783 --> 00:46:07.225]  Oh yeah.
[00:46:07.345 --> 00:46:16.653]  We went into some places that you think is only fantasy land, but it could very well be reality land.
[00:46:16.794 --> 00:46:21.438]  It's stuff that people don't even think about, don't deal with in their daily lives.
[00:46:21.738 --> 00:46:23.360]  That's one of the main things is people
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:32.863]  People out there have to earn a living, they have to make a living for their families, so they haven't got time to go delving into the underhanded stuff that government might be doing.
[00:46:33.383 --> 00:46:45.006]  It's interesting, Alex, that we started this show with the concept that we were going to show both sides of the conspiracy and then allow the viewer to make a choice at the end of which one he or she would choose to believe.
[00:46:45.026 --> 00:46:45.486]  Hold it there!
[00:46:45.646 --> 00:46:46.507]  Gotta break, Governor.
[00:46:46.547 --> 00:46:48.047]  This is key info coming up.
[00:46:48.127 --> 00:46:58.734]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[00:46:59.034 --> 00:47:02.956]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[00:47:03.216 --> 00:47:05.017]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[00:47:05.378 --> 00:47:10.821]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:47:10.981 --> 00:47:20.749]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:47:21.009 --> 00:47:27.274]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[00:47:27.514 --> 00:47:30.836]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[00:47:30.856 --> 00:47:32.678]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:47:32.918 --> 00:47:36.020]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.162]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[00:47:48.529 --> 00:47:49.369]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:54.893]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:47:55.073 --> 00:47:55.474]  I get it.
[00:47:55.634 --> 00:48:04.940]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.401]  That's not what's happening.
[00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:14.905]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:48:15.105 --> 00:48:18.387]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:48:18.507 --> 00:48:22.589]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:48:22.769 --> 00:48:23.769]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:48:24.369 --> 00:48:27.611]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:48:28.331 --> 00:48:31.933]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:48:32.133 --> 00:48:32.853]  You should, too.
[00:48:33.034 --> 00:48:34.014]  Find out what they know.
[00:48:34.194 --> 00:48:37.476]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:48:37.496 --> 00:48:37.536]  800-686-2237.
[00:48:37.556 --> 00:48:37.857]  800-686-2237.
[00:48:37.877 --> 00:48:38.077]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:48:49.193 --> 00:48:52.838]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:48:53.219 --> 00:48:56.223]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:48:56.463 --> 00:49:01.249]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:49:01.269 --> 00:49:05.115]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[00:49:05.755 --> 00:49:07.458]  And they really are calling the shots.
[00:49:07.638 --> 00:49:12.604]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:25.040]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.601]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:49:26.862 --> 00:49:29.124]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:49:29.324 --> 00:49:31.166]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:49:31.446 --> 00:49:36.250]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:49:36.591 --> 00:49:41.395]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:41.615 --> 00:49:45.719]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:47.868 --> 00:49:49.509]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:49:49.629 --> 00:49:51.070]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.230]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:54.271]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:49:54.411 --> 00:50:03.135]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:50:03.195 --> 00:50:08.458]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:50:08.618 --> 00:50:10.240]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:17.829]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:21.995]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[00:50:22.095 --> 00:50:24.598]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[00:50:24.798 --> 00:50:29.681]  Liquid Zeolite comes with a money-back guarantee, but it's only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[00:50:55.493 --> 00:50:55.838]  No matter...
[00:51:06.124 --> 00:51:07.925]  All right, going back to Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:51:07.985 --> 00:51:10.506]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:51:10.766 --> 00:51:12.406]  He'll be with us a little bit into the next hour.
[00:51:12.426 --> 00:51:21.310]  We're going to open the phones up specifically only for Governor Jesse Ventura at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:23.971]  Quick question or comment for the governor coming up.
[00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:26.351]  Okay, you got cut off again by the satellite.
[00:51:26.732 --> 00:51:27.652]  I'm thinking it's going to break.
[00:51:27.732 --> 00:51:28.292]  Start over.
[00:51:28.572 --> 00:51:32.934]  Start over, Governor, with the point that you were making about the TV show.
[00:51:33.334 --> 00:51:41.737]  Well, initially, Alex, we started off to do the show with the concept that both sides of the conspiracy would be told, if there were two sides.
[00:51:41.817 --> 00:51:43.758]  Many times there may be multiple sides.
[00:51:45.039 --> 00:51:48.140]  But the two major sides, and then we'd let the viewer decide.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:59.925]  Well, then the show had to go through a metamorphosis, if you will, or an evolution, whatever you want to call it, because when one side does not cooperate one bit, it is pretty hard to tell their story.
[00:52:00.685 --> 00:52:03.386]  And that was the case of the United States government.
[00:52:03.747 --> 00:52:12.611]  I did an interview the other day, a print interview, and the person asked me and I said, well, you know, the government hasn't cooperated at all.
[00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:15.552]  And they said, this includes when Obama's taken over.
[00:52:15.612 --> 00:52:16.933]  I said, there's been no difference.
[00:52:17.964 --> 00:52:27.652]  I said it hasn't made one bit of difference, because we started the show, George Bush was still the president, and the show's been in the works, and I've been working on it for a year now, basically, or better.
[00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:32.536]  And the government cooperated nothing.
[00:52:32.896 --> 00:52:33.496]  Zero.
[00:52:33.736 --> 00:52:34.157]  Zilch.
[00:52:34.657 --> 00:52:37.459]  We could not even get a spokesperson out for the government.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:46.847]  Well, we do get a few former government people who are now no longer working for the government, who had courage enough to come out and talk to us and offer their opinions.
[00:52:47.467 --> 00:52:51.248]  But no one under the government would cooperate with this show at all.
[00:52:51.709 --> 00:53:06.034]  So then the show became simply more of the other side of the conspiracy being told, and now the viewer gets to see an alternative to what the government has pumped out in many occasions on the different conspiracies that they're involved with.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:15.449]  And by the way, we've got Governor Jesse Ventura with us talking about the new TV show that's coming up in December and January called Conspiracy Theory on TruTV.
[00:53:15.489 --> 00:53:17.551]  Again, Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[00:53:17.911 --> 00:53:20.374]  How much can you tell us about the 9-11 episode?
[00:53:20.414 --> 00:53:25.739]  Because I know that more and more as you went out and tried to talk to them, no one would.
[00:53:26.379 --> 00:53:29.422]  And Jesse Ventura, Navy SEAL, Governor,
[00:53:30.203 --> 00:53:33.687]  In many ways, Michael Moore probably got more cooperation than I got.
[00:53:48.985 --> 00:53:50.686]  Well, let's folks in a little bit.
[00:53:50.946 --> 00:53:51.686]  I got none.
[00:53:52.347 --> 00:53:57.310]  When it came to 9-11, no one from the government would talk to the show.
[00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:00.431]  No one from the 9-11 Commission would talk.
[00:54:01.212 --> 00:54:04.714]  No one representing any type of government agency would talk.
[00:54:05.754 --> 00:54:12.258]  You know, I don't want to wreck the show by saying what we did and where we did it and do all that because I want people to watch the show.
[00:54:12.278 --> 00:54:15.740]  The show came about like this.
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.661]  A victim came to me.
[00:54:18.783 --> 00:54:25.509]  And a victim pleaded with me, a victim who lost her daughter and her potential grandchild.
[00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:31.834]  Her daughter was pregnant and she died the day, the infamous day of 9-11.
[00:54:32.495 --> 00:54:42.063]  And her mom, you know, came to me feeling that I was the person with this show who could bring to light the fact that we need a real investigation of 9-11.
[00:54:43.436 --> 00:54:43.936]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:55:04.608 --> 00:55:05.089]  We're good to go.
[00:55:19.785 --> 00:55:20.845]  Unbelievable.
[00:55:21.566 --> 00:55:24.726]  Again, I don't want to give away too much, but... Well, I want people to watch.
[00:55:24.806 --> 00:55:26.187]  That's why I'm just going to talk.
[00:55:26.627 --> 00:55:35.489]  I'm not going to give specifics of the show, Alex, because I want everyone to enjoy the show, and I won't narrate it before it goes on the air.
[00:55:35.929 --> 00:55:36.890]  No, no, no.
[00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:41.931]  You're giving us a lot here, and I know a lot of the inside baseball, and obviously I'm sworn to secrecy.
[00:55:42.491 --> 00:55:48.773]  I'm just telling folks, I'm surprised you're able to get this on air, Jesse, because... Well, Alex, it ain't on yet.
[00:55:53.628 --> 00:55:58.071]  I made a gentleman's bet at the start of this show that it would never see air.
[00:55:58.671 --> 00:56:07.898]  I felt we would complete them all, but I felt strongly that at some point in time someone wouldn't allow it, and so far it's full steam ahead.
[00:56:08.338 --> 00:56:13.821]  Now we do have to wait until December 2nd because that's the airing again of the first show,
[00:56:18.404 --> 00:56:32.011]  In fact, I remember in October, you were in my car, we were driving around in the hill country, and you said, Alex, we're going to find out if this airs, because I'm going to do this from my perspective and be fair, we're going to see what happens.
[00:56:32.071 --> 00:56:37.254]  And you've put incredible work into it, and now you've just upped the bar again, saying we'll see if it's going to air.
[00:56:37.294 --> 00:56:37.734]  Stay with us.
[00:56:38.234 --> 00:56:39.135]  We're on the march.
[00:56:39.635 --> 00:56:41.116]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:42.152 --> 00:56:44.843]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:47.708 --> 00:56:50.309]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:55.692]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:56:56.052 --> 00:56:57.793]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:56:58.093 --> 00:57:02.916]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:57:03.096 --> 00:57:04.056]  How much do you want?
[00:57:04.276 --> 00:57:05.037]  When do you want it?
[00:57:05.417 --> 00:57:07.018]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:57:07.298 --> 00:57:08.118]  When will you need it?
[00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:10.419]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.680]  Will there be any food?
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.221]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:15.804]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:57:15.964 --> 00:57:18.508]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:57:18.688 --> 00:57:21.893]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:57:22.294 --> 00:57:25.779]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:57:26.099 --> 00:57:27.100]  How much will you need?
[00:57:27.341 --> 00:57:27.962]  We don't know.
[00:57:28.242 --> 00:57:29.163]  How much do you want?
[00:57:29.344 --> 00:57:30.045]  All you can get.
[00:57:30.265 --> 00:57:31.106]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:31.346 --> 00:57:34.108]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:57:46.738 --> 00:57:53.605]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[01:00:00.612 --> 01:00:15.236]  Well, former Minnesota governor, former MSNBC host, former top wrestler, Hollywood movie star, author, best-selling author, multiple times over, and surfer, Jesse Ventura joins us.
[01:00:15.276 --> 01:00:16.117]  The surf is up.
[01:00:16.397 --> 01:00:16.777]  He is here.
[01:00:16.837 --> 01:00:18.357]  Okay, let's go through this then.
[01:00:18.377 --> 01:00:19.538]  Wait a minute, Alex.
[01:00:19.558 --> 01:00:23.519]  How's the surf since that storm has hit Alabama down there?
[01:00:24.264 --> 01:00:24.804]  You know what?
[01:00:25.004 --> 01:00:28.847]  I hear that there is a huge surf down at the Gulf right now.
[01:00:28.887 --> 01:00:30.688]  And every time I go down there, there's surfers everywhere.
[01:00:31.048 --> 01:00:33.470]  Well, I should be down there right now, doggone it.
[01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:45.958]  Why don't you just jump on an airplane, fly... Listen, you can fly to Corpus Christi in two hours from Minnesota, and three and a half, four hours from now, you could be on the beach in 12-foot swells.
[01:00:46.278 --> 01:00:51.361]  Well, I'll tell you, that's very tempting, but unfortunately, I've got too much publicity to do.
[01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:55.623]  Unfortunately, you're here on air with us, but we're all happy, Governor.
[01:00:55.643 --> 01:00:59.085]  Well, it'd be tomorrow anyway, and so I got publicity all day tomorrow.
[01:00:59.185 --> 01:01:04.006]  Today I couldn't get there in time, so it'd have to be tomorrow, but oh well, we'll pass on it this time.
[01:01:04.487 --> 01:01:07.808]  I'm certain there'll be more storms, especially after learning about HAARP.
[01:01:08.883 --> 01:01:09.563]  Absolutely.
[01:01:10.044 --> 01:01:16.106]  You know, I had the director of HAARP on one time, and he admitted, oh, we turned the atmosphere on fire with it at night.
[01:01:16.126 --> 01:01:26.451]  He starts laughing, and then somebody on the line cut the line off, and my producer saw this, and during the break, an Air Force officer came on and said, you can't talk about that anymore.
[01:01:26.731 --> 01:01:32.934]  So the military was bossing the civilian scientific head of HAARP around.
[01:01:33.194 --> 01:01:41.557]  Well, what's interesting, and of course for those that don't know what HAARP is, HAARP is way up in Alaska, and that's one of the shows we go up to visit and photograph it.
[01:01:42.597 --> 01:01:50.440]  And it's a group of about 180 radio antennas that all shoot 50,000 watts of energy up into the biosphere.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:57.522]  I should say of low frequency sounds up into the biosphere, which does cause a heating.
[01:01:57.562 --> 01:01:59.043]  Now, Alex, let me ask you this.
[01:02:00.023 --> 01:02:03.565]  Does... Could that possibly contribute to global warming?
[01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:05.686]  Absolutely!
[01:02:05.746 --> 01:02:12.749]  In fact, the scientists we've interviewed... This could be much more contributor of global warming than us driving our cars around.
[01:02:14.568 --> 01:02:27.557]  Well, as you know, Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97 admitted to the Army Times they did have weather weapons then, and I've interviewed the former father of weather weapons, Ben Livingston, and clearly I believe this is a false flag attack.
[01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:35.202]  We have had a lot of strange weather, and that naturally occurs, but there's been a lot of... Well, that's going to be, that's the opening show, Alex.
[01:02:35.423 --> 01:02:41.327]  The opening show, December 2nd, is on HAARP, and I think people are going to find it a very interesting show.
[01:02:43.064 --> 01:02:53.127]  I went all the way up to Alaska and went to this location and we jumped into a helicopter and bear this in mind, this thing can knock airplanes out of the air.
[01:02:55.787 --> 01:03:00.888]  And it's a very interesting thing going on up there.
[01:03:01.049 --> 01:03:06.890]  It's the government, it falls under, let me put it this way, it falls under the military, the Air Force.
[01:03:07.967 --> 01:03:14.510]  And yet it is given the distinction of being an unclassified research center, yet I was not allowed in.
[01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:26.235]  Now, bear in mind, I used to have a top-secret security clearance with the United States government during my six years as a member of underwater demolition team 12 and SEAL team 1.
[01:03:27.894 --> 01:03:36.809]  I was also a mayor and a governor, and yet I was not allowed to go into this supposed unclassified research center.
[01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:41.117]  If it's unclassified, anybody should be able to go in there.
[01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:44.140]  Well, that's a good point.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:51.045]  Jesse, on this specific subject, we can get into more detail because this has been released to the media.
[01:03:51.065 --> 01:03:53.487]  I want to play this clip and then ask you about it.
[01:03:53.507 --> 01:03:57.491]  This is a one-minute clip of Governor Jesse Ventura being stopped at the gates.
[01:03:58.331 --> 01:04:01.014]  He's about to just, I guess, bull his way on in there.
[01:04:01.794 --> 01:04:03.295]  And suddenly,
[01:04:04.298 --> 01:04:06.759]  The equipment goes dead, and I talked to the crew.
[01:04:06.979 --> 01:04:09.180]  This really happened.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.662]  So they were using some type of electronic warfare jamming system.
[01:04:14.042 --> 01:04:15.243]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:15.263 --> 01:04:17.104]  We really need to go through the Air Force.
[01:04:17.124 --> 01:04:19.705]  Well, we did, and we got stonewalled.
[01:04:19.745 --> 01:04:22.466]  And this is strictly a research facility.
[01:04:22.566 --> 01:04:26.708]  Clearly, there's something going on here that they don't want people to know about.
[01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:29.329]  There's a lot of cool science that we do in this facility.
[01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:30.710]  Come on, man, I'm a Navy SEAL.
[01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:38.335]  The military don't do things unless it has a military purpose, and a military purpose is destruction and waging war.
[01:04:39.055 --> 01:04:39.815]  It's a stalemate.
[01:04:40.616 --> 01:04:41.236]  Or is it?
[01:04:42.237 --> 01:04:46.199]  Back up a little bit from the gate so when people come through they don't feel intimidated.
[01:04:46.239 --> 01:04:49.581]  When I get denied something, I do the opposite of getting intimidated.
[01:04:50.322 --> 01:04:50.822]  I get angry.
[01:04:51.303 --> 01:04:55.505]  Jesse is about to walk right on through, when suddenly... Buzz off.
[01:04:55.545 --> 01:04:56.806]  Sorry guys, I got a problem.
[01:04:57.006 --> 01:04:58.307]  They're asking for their parents.
[01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:02.455]  The camera equipment begins to go haywire.
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:08.186]  Something is interfering with the audio and video.
[01:05:09.227 --> 01:05:10.890]  This is more than unclassified.
[01:05:10.931 --> 01:05:11.552]  That's bullshit.
[01:05:15.009 --> 01:05:17.171]  Alright, now that aired on CNN.
[01:05:17.331 --> 01:05:18.792]  The potty language was cut out.
[01:05:20.673 --> 01:05:23.035]  But I don't blame the governor under that bizarre stress.
[01:05:23.075 --> 01:05:27.619]  So, tell us what you can about the Harp episode, because this is amazing.
[01:05:27.899 --> 01:05:43.071]  Well, you know, we were denied access, as I said, and you know, even though the security clearances I've had in my life and holding the position of governor, I guess, Alex, the only way I guess I can get in there is to run and get re-elected to something again.
[01:05:43.914 --> 01:05:49.777]  You know, then maybe I would be high enough in the government that they would let me in and see what they're doing there, but that aside.
[01:05:51.078 --> 01:05:53.299]  And then, we did have some problem.
[01:05:53.339 --> 01:05:58.162]  Now, it made it seem—I don't know what caused our cameras to go bad.
[01:05:58.302 --> 01:06:04.565]  I am not going to specifically sit here and say that they jammed and that they did something to them.
[01:06:04.585 --> 01:06:11.429]  I will simply state that our audio and our visual did have some problems while we were outside the gate.
[01:06:11.989 --> 01:06:16.055]  Who or what was responsible, we never were sure of.
[01:06:16.255 --> 01:06:18.779]  We never were sure or positively found out.
[01:06:19.278 --> 01:06:32.226]  But to be specific, and correct me if I'm wrong, because I was just talking to some of the crew while we were shooting separately back in Los Angeles, they said that multiple cameras and audio and on the digital recordings, it was even distorting.
[01:06:32.626 --> 01:06:39.150]  I mean, this wasn't just one rig to have separate malfunctions, the same malfunctions.
[01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:42.692]  You're talking about one in a billion, one in a trillion?
[01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:43.733]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[01:06:44.113 --> 01:06:44.594]  I don't know.
[01:06:44.614 --> 01:06:45.655]  I don't know.
[01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:54.083]  But all I can say is that we did run into complications, and what caused them or why, we were never able to ascertain.
[01:06:54.744 --> 01:07:03.092]  But you know, and then later on, all the equipment later worked fine, and we never had any more problem with it the rest of the shoot.
[01:07:03.813 --> 01:07:06.395]  Well, I want to say, clearly on the record,
[01:07:07.193 --> 01:07:07.573]  Well, let's
[01:07:30.057 --> 01:07:31.938]  Let's remember something, too, Alex.
[01:07:31.978 --> 01:07:40.660]  There were treaties signed back in the 1970s that governments would not use weather or nature for war.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.541]  And we were one of the people that signed these treaties.
[01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:48.002]  And I think that's an important issue right here.
[01:07:48.722 --> 01:07:59.165]  If we sign treaties that we won't use things, won't use nature to commit war, and then we might very well be violating the very treaties we've signed.
[01:08:00.503 --> 01:08:08.241]  Well that's a great point and you made the point to me privately that, well Alex, why are we signing treaties for weather weapons if they don't exist?
[01:08:09.183 --> 01:08:10.185]  That's true also.
[01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:30.601]  So, you know, and I think people are also going to enjoy, there's another part of HAARP that we haven't mentioned today that will be the most terrifying of anything we've talked about, and I'm going to leave that up in the air, because HAARP is going to be, to my knowledge, the first episode December 2nd, again,
[01:08:31.361 --> 01:08:33.503]  I know what it is, but I'm going to keep my mouth shut.
[01:08:53.444 --> 01:08:54.084]  This is coming up.
[01:08:54.104 --> 01:09:05.889]  You know, finishing up before we get into the other episodes, during the break we were talking, you're saying you made the bet with your crew, and I remember you telling me privately in the car, you said, we'll see if it's going to air.
[01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.730]  I don't think it will, but we'll see.
[01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:09.590]  I'm going to try.
[01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:13.831]  Well, I did a gentleman's bet with my crew and cast, basically.
[01:09:13.951 --> 01:09:17.993]  I said, I bet you no money involved, just a gentleman's bet.
[01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:30.295]  That we will complete all of these, we will do all seven episodes, and we'll finish them all, but I said I still don't believe they will see the light of day that they will be aired.
[01:09:30.935 --> 01:09:37.416]  And so far I'm losing the gentleman's bet, but there's still about three weeks to go, and I hope that I do lose it.
[01:09:37.976 --> 01:09:45.398]  I do not want, and I'm a competitive person, I do not like to lose anything, but I'm hoping that I lose this bet.
[01:09:46.198 --> 01:09:47.618]  I don't want to win this bet.
[01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:54.668]  Well, I hope that you do lose the bet as well, because I've been involved in a few TV productions.
[01:09:56.029 --> 01:09:57.190]  One of them... I'll put it this way, Alex.
[01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:06.235]  If it doesn't see the light of day, this show, that we've completed, then I need to come back on your show and we need to ask why.
[01:10:06.255 --> 01:10:10.918]  We need to, at that point, start addressing, I believe, the First Amendment.
[01:10:12.756 --> 01:10:13.316]  I agree with you.
[01:10:14.117 --> 01:10:19.042]  Well, I don't see how they're going to air something that's more than fair from our perspective.
[01:10:19.422 --> 01:10:26.188]  And from what I've seen, and I know you're an honorable person, this is an extremely fair leaning towards our perspective.
[01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:31.052]  Because as you said, you couldn't get the other side to come out and debate.
[01:10:31.453 --> 01:10:32.974]  There's nothing but stonewalling.
[01:10:33.174 --> 01:10:34.856]  It isn't even a debate, Alex.
[01:10:34.916 --> 01:10:37.978]  We couldn't even get them to come out and make a comment.
[01:10:38.038 --> 01:10:41.021]  The government wouldn't talk to us, plain and simple.
[01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:42.923]  They wouldn't talk on HAARP.
[01:10:43.343 --> 01:10:45.085]  They wouldn't talk on 9-11.
[01:10:45.445 --> 01:10:54.193]  They wouldn't talk on anything that involved the government and their involvement in any type of conspiracy or whatever the conspiracy is.
[01:10:54.873 --> 01:10:59.217]  You cannot get anyone from government to participate or talk in any manner.
[01:10:59.537 --> 01:11:00.518]  It's that simple.
[01:11:00.978 --> 01:11:11.786]  And people need to understand, that's the scary thing, overwhelmingly scary thing about doing this whole show, is the fact that government doesn't have to cooperate.
[01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:14.649]  They act like we work for them.
[01:11:15.209 --> 01:11:18.552]  And I believe they've forgotten something and we've forgotten something.
[01:11:18.952 --> 01:11:19.873]  They work for us.
[01:11:20.658 --> 01:11:22.259]  That's the way it's supposed to be.
[01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:25.701]  But in this country, I believe those roles have switched now.
[01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:30.624]  And the government views us working for them rather than the way it's supposed to be.
[01:11:32.866 --> 01:11:39.590]  Well, that's just an incredible point that things really are backwards now in this nation, in this country.
[01:11:40.758 --> 01:11:50.284]  And if they do allow this to go on television, which it looks like it's going to happen, is that that the system is so arrogant that they don't even care if we know the truth now?
[01:11:50.624 --> 01:12:01.971]  I'm seeing George Soros and Al Gore and Ban Ki-moon of the UN openly say we're going under world government, openly saying it's a new world order, openly stating it's about population reduction.
[01:12:02.956 --> 01:12:10.260]  One child policy, LA Times reports there's going to be a tax on owning a dog or cat because they eat meat, which has a carbon footprint.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.661]  You've got the global warming episode, we're going to talk about that.
[01:12:14.161 --> 01:12:15.842]  I mean, they're really coming out in the open.
[01:12:15.882 --> 01:12:21.745]  So is it that they don't have total control of the media, and so you're getting through the chink in the armor?
[01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:27.788]  Or is it they're so arrogant now, they don't care if Governor Ventura goes out and tells you how screwed you are?
[01:12:28.068 --> 01:12:31.930]  They might even sit back and, you know, roast some marshmallows and laugh at us.
[01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:33.471]  I don't know, Alex.
[01:12:33.611 --> 01:12:39.273]  I'm not in contact with any of these quote-unquote people, so I have no idea.
[01:12:39.293 --> 01:12:47.016]  Oh, by the way, yeah, global warming is the last one that I list to you of the—we do a—is global warming a conspiracy?
[01:12:47.469 --> 01:12:52.294]  That we were both here trying to remember all seven episodes and finally it came to me so I thought I'd shout it out.
[01:12:53.235 --> 01:13:03.105]  Well you got it right there because that was the seventh one that I like I said when I shot these things they were not in sequence always and so it can get pretty confusing.
[01:13:03.185 --> 01:13:09.391]  It was a lot like governing where you go from one meeting one hour to a completely different meeting the next hour.
[01:13:09.531 --> 01:13:13.512]  No, no, I know it makes your head spin, especially when you're really into the minutia.
[01:13:14.033 --> 01:13:19.855]  Let's get into 2012, then we'll get into secret societies, Manchurian Candidate, Big Brother, and global warming.
[01:13:20.755 --> 01:13:31.119]  2012, obviously three days from now, on Friday, the huge movie is coming out where Woody Harrelson kind of plays the conspiracy theory type.
[01:13:32.359 --> 01:13:34.521]  I know Harrelson, so we're trying to get him on the show.
[01:13:34.541 --> 01:13:35.582]  In fact, that may happen.
[01:13:36.042 --> 01:13:42.367]  But what's your whole take on the real 2012 and the serious, in-depth research you did?
[01:13:42.647 --> 01:13:51.153]  And then separately in the show, I know you get into, without saying too much, whether it's real or not, the elite think it's real and they are getting ready.
[01:13:51.213 --> 01:13:54.375]  I mean, to me, I think, in fact, I wish I was in that episode.
[01:13:54.395 --> 01:13:55.176]  I've been told I'm not.
[01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:57.638]  To me, that's going to be one of the hottest episodes.
[01:13:58.038 --> 01:14:13.226]  Well, it is, and let me just put it this way, and again, I'm not going to go in and make it so people won't watch by telling everything that happens, but it goes far beyond, let me say this, the Mayan calendar.
[01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:22.971]  Now, the Mayans were very intelligent people way ahead of their time when it came to understanding the planets and the solar system and the heavens.
[01:14:23.815 --> 01:14:25.916]  They truly were, because I've learned this.
[01:14:26.577 --> 01:14:31.200]  Even with all of our modern technology today, the Mayans are right on.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.962]  Our technology, for the most part, cannot prove them wrong.
[01:14:36.582 --> 01:14:37.583]  Under most things.
[01:14:38.324 --> 01:14:46.291]  So here you had a culture that took place many, many, many years ago that was very, very bright when it came to space.
[01:14:47.172 --> 01:14:51.976]  And this 2012 show goes beyond the Mayan calendar.
[01:14:52.376 --> 01:14:58.562]  It goes to some things that we know are actually real and completely backed up by NASA.
[01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:07.706]  And that's where I'll leave it right there, because I want people intrigued, I want them to watch the show, and the show will be on long before 2012 arrives.
[01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:12.748]  Are you, knowing what you now know, doing the deep research, are you concerned about 2012?
[01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:21.532]  I'm concerned, yeah, I'm concerned over things that I have learned, yes, I'm very concerned over them.
[01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:36.117]  And later on when the show is all air, Alex, and I don't have to try to intrigue a listening audience anymore, I'll be glad to come back on the show and openly talk about what concerns me after it airs.
[01:15:36.989 --> 01:15:37.509]  Absolutely.
[01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:38.710]  That'd be a great radio interview.
[01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:40.872]  And also talk about how much hit the cutting room floor.
[01:15:41.272 --> 01:15:42.974]  You guys have done a ton of work.
[01:15:43.034 --> 01:15:44.415]  I mean, they've been working your butt off.
[01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:45.796]  Oh, week to week.
[01:15:45.876 --> 01:15:50.219]  Yeah, I've been... Here I'm trying to... You know how it works in the country, Alex?
[01:15:50.259 --> 01:15:54.783]  When you try to retire and quit, that's when your agent finds your jobs.
[01:15:56.687 --> 01:16:00.349]  But when you're looking for the jobs for 20 years, they can't find you anything.
[01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:03.071]  No, I've been to L.A.
[01:16:03.131 --> 01:16:05.652]  so many times I can't remember since summer.
[01:16:06.012 --> 01:16:07.333]  I've been to Anchorage, Alaska.
[01:16:07.473 --> 01:16:08.914]  I've been to San Francisco.
[01:16:08.974 --> 01:16:14.477]  I've been to Oklahoma City, Kansas City, New York, multiple, multiple times.
[01:16:15.117 --> 01:16:18.719]  And I've lost track of a few of the other places that I've been to.
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:23.042]  But the most unique was the thing going up to Anchorage to learn about harp.
[01:16:24.602 --> 01:16:25.304]  Absolutely.
[01:16:25.324 --> 01:16:27.668]  And again, I'm hugging there.
[01:16:27.688 --> 01:16:34.360]  Let me interject, Alex, of which I, up until about four months ago, I didn't even know what harp was.
[01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:37.470]  Didn't even know what it was.
[01:16:56.118 --> 01:17:02.400]  Well, it sure is, and the exciting thing that I'll tell people when people say to me, why do I like to study this?
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.120]  Why do I like to look at it?
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.381]  Because these are things that very well can be real.
[01:17:08.161 --> 01:17:17.064]  And when you read a writer like, say, Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn, they're marvelous books, but they're simply figments of their imagination.
[01:17:17.955 --> 01:17:21.779]  They're carrying you through on their imaginary trip.
[01:17:22.499 --> 01:17:34.891]  I would rather look into and read about real history and hopefully get educated on it so that we're not stupid enough to allow ourselves to repeat it, which over and over I see it happening.
[01:17:36.012 --> 01:17:40.977]  Our stupidity is just unbelievable how we can be duped over and over again.
[01:17:41.562 --> 01:17:42.182]  Absolutely.
[01:17:42.202 --> 01:17:45.643]  I mean, really, a conspiracy theorist is someone with an alternative history view.
[01:17:46.204 --> 01:17:46.904]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:47.284 --> 01:17:54.106]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:17:54.266 --> 01:17:55.487]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:17:55.527 --> 01:17:56.207]  It's very real.
[01:17:56.347 --> 01:18:00.088]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:18:00.228 --> 01:18:04.530]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:07.072]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:20.826]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:18:20.906 --> 01:18:23.529]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:30.791]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:18:49.592 --> 01:18:52.274]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:18:52.855 --> 01:18:56.437]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:18:57.258 --> 01:19:06.184]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[01:19:06.504 --> 01:19:08.405]  Rely instead on OxySilver.
[01:19:08.725 --> 01:19:14.149]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:19:14.429 --> 01:19:19.231]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[01:19:19.851 --> 01:19:24.573]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[01:19:24.833 --> 01:19:27.654]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[01:19:44.386 --> 01:19:45.767]  This call could save your life.
[01:19:46.966 --> 01:19:48.207]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:19:48.267 --> 01:19:53.610]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:58.472]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:19:58.872 --> 01:19:59.252]  It's true.
[01:19:59.352 --> 01:20:01.914]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:20:02.154 --> 01:20:03.915]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:20:04.435 --> 01:20:09.138]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:20:09.659 --> 01:20:11.580]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:16.583]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:20:16.783 --> 01:20:17.684]  And here's the best part.
[01:20:17.884 --> 01:20:20.666]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:20:20.966 --> 01:20:24.268]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:20:24.589 --> 01:20:27.431]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:20:27.771 --> 01:20:29.672]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:30.913]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:20:34.555 --> 01:20:36.337]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:20:38.799 --> 01:20:43.303]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:20:43.623 --> 01:20:46.005]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:20:52.927 --> 01:20:53.928]  Big Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:21:14.765 --> 01:21:21.831]  Governor, one more time for people tuning in and getting this exclusive first look at the TV show that, believe me, is going to be powerful, folks.
[01:21:22.231 --> 01:21:27.876]  Tell them when the seven episodes are going to air, how they tune in, how they watch it.
[01:21:28.376 --> 01:21:32.239]  Well, it'll be on the True Network, which used to be Court Television.
[01:21:32.379 --> 01:21:38.124]  It's located, if you've got the satellite, I think it's right in between TBS and TNT.
[01:21:39.352 --> 01:21:43.776]  It's the station in between if you're on the direct dish satellite or whatever it is.
[01:21:44.516 --> 01:21:45.937]  But, you know, check wherever.
[01:21:45.977 --> 01:21:53.163]  And anyway, the first show will air Wednesday, December 2nd, and it'll be 10 o'clock Eastern, 9 o'clock Central.
[01:21:54.184 --> 01:21:55.485]  And it's a one-hour show.
[01:21:55.525 --> 01:21:57.346]  We're doing seven conspiracies.
[01:21:57.446 --> 01:22:04.152]  And naturally, I'd like to say this, can we get completely into the conspiracies and everything about them?
[01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:05.153]  Absolutely not.
[01:22:05.193 --> 01:22:06.654]  You can never do that in an hour.
[01:22:07.418 --> 01:22:17.747]  So we focus on just certain portions of the conspiracy, which I think people will find it, especially your listening audience, Alex, are going to find it very interesting.
[01:22:18.527 --> 01:22:25.313]  And so it's going to be airing every Wednesday in December and January, or are they going to skip one on Christmas?
[01:22:25.593 --> 01:22:26.454]  I have no idea.
[01:22:27.114 --> 01:22:32.679]  I'll be gone surfing at that time, and I'll leave all of you up here to take the repercussions from it.
[01:22:35.714 --> 01:22:38.615]  What are you going to do if I come parachuting in when you're out there surfing?
[01:22:39.395 --> 01:22:47.438]  Well, then I'll know everything hit the fan up here, because I know that if you're not doing your daily radio show, then the United States don't exist anymore.
[01:22:48.498 --> 01:22:50.759]  Now, is my bunker ready next to your bungalow?
[01:22:50.779 --> 01:22:53.880]  I don't know.
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:23:05.044]  You know, I'll tell you that my neighbor Fernando, he had to dig a 40-foot well down there and it took him six months, but it would have taken him a year had there been good waves.
[01:23:07.111 --> 01:23:08.852]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:23:09.212 --> 01:23:13.515]  Okay, we're going to come back and take phone calls, but right now let's get into the global warming episode.
[01:23:13.675 --> 01:23:14.115]  Okay.
[01:23:14.135 --> 01:23:16.076]  I mean, just give us a little taste of that.
[01:23:16.316 --> 01:23:20.699]  Well, the big thing on global warming to me is this cap-and-trade legislation.
[01:23:21.399 --> 01:23:23.361]  It's nothing but bait-and-switch.
[01:23:23.961 --> 01:23:28.784]  It's a legislation that's designed to make money, not solve the problem.
[01:23:29.444 --> 01:23:39.010]  And if global warming is indeed a problem, then why is the solution simply money-making that does nothing to address the actual problem?
[01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:45.354]  And that's the key of what we try to expose, and this is the cap-and-trade legislation for what it is.
[01:23:45.894 --> 01:23:56.601]  And the fact that there are 30,000 people with PhDs and science degrees that simply are not buying into global warming, and it doesn't seem to be that they get any type of
[01:23:57.737 --> 01:23:59.839]  Their opinion is not being aired at all.
[01:24:00.339 --> 01:24:00.779]  Well, that's right.
[01:24:00.859 --> 01:24:02.460]  It's a very one-sided opinion.
[01:24:02.981 --> 01:24:14.709]  Well, yeah, when Al Gore says, all scientists agree it's man-made, and then you find out that actually the majority say it's driven by the sun and by nuclei from space causing cloud condensation.
[01:24:14.989 --> 01:24:19.913]  I mean, I'm not going to give away who you interview in the film, but this is going to be a powerful death blow.
[01:24:21.614 --> 01:24:24.657]  One more nail in the coffin against the Greenies that want to tax us.
[01:24:24.697 --> 01:24:28.880]  I mean, it's come out that Al Gore has made over a billion bucks so far off this.
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:34.145]  I mean, he owns a cap-and-trade company that you've got to buy carbon credits from.
[01:24:34.205 --> 01:24:35.426]  I mean, how obvious is this?
[01:24:35.726 --> 01:24:39.309]  Well, again, it comes down to the legislature.
[01:24:39.649 --> 01:24:44.694]  I'm not a scientist, Alex, so I'm not going to beat my head against the wall on whether it's real or not.
[01:24:45.334 --> 01:24:52.538]  But a good way to look at things is always view something not from what someone says, but from what someone does.
[01:24:53.398 --> 01:25:00.762]  And the cap-and-trade legislation is fraudulent, because you could have a company that's supposedly polluting.
[01:25:00.782 --> 01:25:02.803]  They don't have to change at all.
[01:25:02.863 --> 01:25:13.508]  They can simply pay money and buy other people's and trade, so that until they get under, and they'll still pollute the same, but then they'll be able to say that they're not.
[01:25:14.108 --> 01:25:15.950]  Well, that right away is fraudulent.
[01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:18.953]  And if that's fraudulent, then what else is fraudulent?
[01:25:19.753 --> 01:25:21.055]  I tell you, that's a key point.
[01:25:21.115 --> 01:25:23.777]  Take the weakest part of their argument, break their neck right there.
[01:25:23.797 --> 01:25:25.338]  That's why we love you, Governor.
[01:25:25.359 --> 01:25:26.059]  Stay with us.
[01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:30.463]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:25:32.125 --> 01:25:34.307]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:25:36.687 --> 01:25:45.813]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:25:45.833 --> 01:25:48.975]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:25:49.215 --> 01:25:54.898]  Instead, use vitamin C-D in OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:25:55.078 --> 01:25:59.581]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:25:59.841 --> 01:26:02.203]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:26:02.483 --> 01:26:11.547]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:17.109]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:19.030]  Help others and earn extra income!
[01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.530]  We're good to go.
[01:26:51.758 --> 01:26:52.378]  Big Brother.
[01:26:53.058 --> 01:26:54.099]  Mainstream media.
[01:26:54.819 --> 01:26:55.919]  Government cover-ups.
[01:26:56.579 --> 01:26:57.400]  You want answers?
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.080]  Well, so does he.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:03.382]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:03.902 --> 01:27:08.003]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:27:10.084 --> 01:27:15.945]  Alright, in this five minutes, we're going to get into Secret Societies, Manchurian Candidate, and Big Brother.
[01:27:17.706 --> 01:27:21.127]  The three episodes we haven't given you a little
[01:27:23.131 --> 01:27:23.712]  I think so.
[01:27:39.625 --> 01:27:41.265]  Well, I guess let's go Manchurian Candidate.
[01:27:41.285 --> 01:27:44.546]  This one is going to be a very, this one is a very terrifying show.
[01:28:04.388 --> 01:28:07.210]  We all know that MKUltra was real.
[01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:08.831]  The documents state so.
[01:28:08.951 --> 01:28:25.622]  So there's no gray area there that the government was in the business back in the 50s, 60s, and 70s of attempting to control people's minds and attempting to manipulate them and to use them to their advantage both militarily and whatever.
[01:28:26.522 --> 01:28:32.266]  Well, all indications are that those programs have been re-ramped up again and they're back on a high level again.
[01:28:33.423 --> 01:28:40.747]  And that being said, that's what the Manchurian candidate deals with, of course, and that we've all heard the story.
[01:28:41.368 --> 01:28:48.512]  One of the interesting things I'll say is that the guy who shot John Lennon fits it perfectly, Mark David Chapman.
[01:28:49.352 --> 01:28:54.555]  Because contrary to popular belief, Chapman was no Beatles fanatic.
[01:28:55.316 --> 01:29:00.599]  If you go back in his history, in fact, his favorite artist was Todd Rundgren, who's hardly a Beatle.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.840]  Which is a classic mind control
[01:29:19.788 --> 01:29:25.052]  When they torture them under the drugs in one of the systems, they then become obsessed with the trigger word.
[01:29:25.213 --> 01:29:29.116]  When McVeigh got pulled over, he said, get the chip out of me and was foaming at the mouth.
[01:29:29.656 --> 01:29:33.639]  And then the most famous mind control scientist ever, Jolion West, was his doctor.
[01:29:34.676 --> 01:29:41.181]  Well, I'll tell you, it's funny you should say that, Alex, because amazingly, when it first happened, scarily, that's the first thing that popped into my head.
[01:29:57.632 --> 01:30:12.302]  Unbelievable that you say that, because that's the exact first thing that popped into my head when I first heard about the Fort Hood shootings, and when I started then reading about the whole situation, how the guy never had it in his background.
[01:30:14.147 --> 01:30:22.154]  And then now the CIA and FBI are watching him and he has this fake history that suddenly began and then commanders and people said bust him and they wouldn't do it.
[01:30:22.514 --> 01:30:23.295]  Same thing with 9-11.
[01:30:23.415 --> 01:30:24.996]  Then he's a psychiatrist.
[01:30:25.296 --> 01:30:27.278]  He has that whole history.
[01:30:27.358 --> 01:30:30.140]  Once you've studied mind control, he just fits.
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:31.701]  Every piece fits.
[01:30:32.162 --> 01:30:33.563]  And I wouldn't say this last week.
[01:30:33.583 --> 01:30:35.004]  I mean, I knew that was going on Thursday.
[01:30:35.284 --> 01:30:40.729]  But now, more and more of the pieces are coming out and man, the hair on the back of my neck just stands up.
[01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:42.478]  Anyway, enough Manchurian.
[01:30:42.498 --> 01:30:43.479]  What are the last two shows?
[01:30:43.499 --> 01:30:45.381]  Tell us about your book, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[01:30:45.421 --> 01:30:45.681]  What about it?
[01:31:05.131 --> 01:31:06.732]  Well, no, just how folks can get it.
[01:31:06.833 --> 01:31:07.874]  It's been a best-seller.
[01:31:07.894 --> 01:31:08.594]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:31:08.654 --> 01:31:12.037]  It's still in the bookstores, and I guess you can get it over the internet.
[01:31:12.298 --> 01:31:15.821]  I've been so involved in this thing, I haven't even thought about the book for months.
[01:31:16.732 --> 01:31:18.872]  Well, I just wanted to plug your book because it's a good book.
[01:31:19.213 --> 01:31:20.013]  Oh, thank you.
[01:31:20.053 --> 01:31:21.173]  And it's still out there.
[01:31:21.233 --> 01:31:25.274]  I was actually in the Minneapolis airport the other day and I saw copies there for sale.
[01:31:25.334 --> 01:31:29.935]  So, it's a book that I, it's got a lot of my heart and soul in it.
[01:31:29.995 --> 01:31:32.976]  I wrote it, you know, on my trips to Mexico and all that.
[01:31:33.676 --> 01:31:36.976]  And it includes my wife and it tells you about my years in office.
[01:31:37.076 --> 01:31:39.137]  And it'll give you a great insight into how I think.
[01:31:39.717 --> 01:31:40.358]  Absolutely.
[01:31:40.378 --> 01:31:45.541]  Okay, the two final episodes briefly and your phone calls for Governor Jesse Ventura giving us the exclusive.
[01:31:45.801 --> 01:31:46.501]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:46.721 --> 01:31:49.643]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:31:50.103 --> 01:31:53.265]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:31:53.725 --> 01:31:58.108]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:31:58.308 --> 01:31:59.729]  These emergency backup systems
[01:31:59.949 --> 01:32:02.451]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:08.675]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:11.998]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:32:12.578 --> 01:32:17.001]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:32:17.402 --> 01:32:23.706]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:32:23.966 --> 01:32:25.888]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:32:26.388 --> 01:32:29.210]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[01:32:47.383 --> 01:32:49.985]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:50.405 --> 01:32:55.369]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:55.730 --> 01:32:57.471]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:57.771 --> 01:33:02.595]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:33:02.775 --> 01:33:03.736]  How much do you want?
[01:33:03.956 --> 01:33:04.696]  When do you want it?
[01:33:05.077 --> 01:33:06.678]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:33:06.978 --> 01:33:07.799]  When will you need it?
[01:33:08.039 --> 01:33:10.101]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:33:10.241 --> 01:33:11.342]  Will there be any food?
[01:33:11.582 --> 01:33:12.903]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:33:13.103 --> 01:33:18.168]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:33:18.369 --> 01:33:21.572]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:33:21.952 --> 01:33:25.456]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:33:25.777 --> 01:33:26.758]  How much will you need?
[01:33:26.998 --> 01:33:27.619]  We don't know.
[01:33:27.899 --> 01:33:28.820]  How much do you want?
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:29.741]  All you can get.
[01:33:29.941 --> 01:33:30.762]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:31.262]  I think.
[01:33:46.334 --> 01:33:51.501]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:33:51.641 --> 01:33:53.604]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:33:53.724 --> 01:33:56.007]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:33:56.167 --> 01:33:58.030]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:33:58.450 --> 01:33:59.812]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:34:00.072 --> 01:34:01.114]  There is a solution.
[01:34:01.334 --> 01:34:09.340]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:16.825]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:34:17.205 --> 01:34:22.869]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:24.529]  I love their Nutri Cafe.
[01:34:24.789 --> 01:34:28.851]  Great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:34:29.271 --> 01:34:33.072]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:34:33.412 --> 01:34:40.074]  Go to ENERFOOD.com or give them a call right now.
[01:34:40.094 --> 01:34:40.554]  866-762-9238.
[01:34:40.874 --> 01:34:44.175]  Click on their banner at InfoWars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:34:48.692 --> 01:34:54.741]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:34:55.342 --> 01:34:58.307]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:07.728 --> 01:35:13.995]  Governor Jesse Ventura, he's worn a lot of hats, but now he is fighting the New World Order.
[01:35:14.656 --> 01:35:20.223]  And I don't want to put words in his mouth, but Governor, I think it's safe to say, I mean, you now know there's a world government, there is an elite.
[01:35:20.603 --> 01:35:22.926]  The question is, how evil are they?
[01:35:23.086 --> 01:35:24.107]  Are they monolithic?
[01:35:24.268 --> 01:35:25.269]  What is their main goal?
[01:35:25.469 --> 01:35:37.901]  Is it fair to say that you're now officially, not their label of conspiracy theorist, but you question JFK, you question 9-11, you question HAARP, you're not buying the Kool-Aid they're selling.
[01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:38.701]  Is that fair to say?
[01:35:39.142 --> 01:35:41.224]  Well, let me put it this way.
[01:35:41.864 --> 01:35:45.288]  Irregardless of anything, it sure is interesting stuff.
[01:35:46.128 --> 01:35:52.591]  And, uh, you know, we do a show on the Bilderbergs and I do understand that they're real.
[01:35:52.671 --> 01:35:58.254]  I guess the thing that upsets me the most was I made it to governor and they never invited me.
[01:35:59.875 --> 01:36:08.179]  And I guess maybe I gotta run for office again then so I can get invited to this thing to find out what the hell goes on inside there.
[01:36:08.567 --> 01:36:15.851]  Well, they would have invited you if you would have gone along with the CIA when they set you down at the governor's office two weeks into office.
[01:36:15.891 --> 01:36:17.653]  But, I mean, you're not selling people out.
[01:36:18.193 --> 01:36:21.075]  You're a swashbuckling, you know, loose cannon for freedom.
[01:36:22.115 --> 01:36:25.157]  But, I mean, what is your view on the New World Order then?
[01:36:25.177 --> 01:36:26.938]  Because I know you're anti-establishment.
[01:36:26.958 --> 01:36:28.719]  Well, let me put it to you this way.
[01:36:28.739 --> 01:36:31.981]  Then I also look at it from a different perspective, Alex.
[01:36:32.221 --> 01:36:33.362]  I believe in evolution.
[01:36:34.323 --> 01:36:35.523]  The science of evolution.
[01:36:37.051 --> 01:36:38.552]  Maybe this is evolution.
[01:36:40.513 --> 01:36:55.240]  You know, when you look at it, that we will evolve, and that maybe it won't fully be here in our lifetimes, but a hundred years from now, because of the fact with technology the way it is, the world gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:03.864]  And I guess, let me, just for the sake of argument, state that there would be one good thing if there was a one world government.
[01:37:03.904 --> 01:37:04.765]  You know what that would be?
[01:37:07.206 --> 01:37:09.127]  There couldn't be wars then, could there?
[01:37:09.948 --> 01:37:13.089]  But see, Governor, that is the... No, I mean, literally.
[01:37:13.969 --> 01:37:16.910]  Then you wouldn't have one country fighting another country.
[01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:18.471]  No, but that's not their plan.
[01:37:18.591 --> 01:37:20.132]  Oh, I understand that, Alex.
[01:37:20.212 --> 01:37:22.312]  Don't for a minute think I'm naive.
[01:37:22.753 --> 01:37:35.818]  But I am saying that there is the chance that this could be almost an evolutionary thing, that we will evolve to the point where there may well be a one-world government and there may be no way around it.
[01:37:36.279 --> 01:37:40.608]  Then the important thing, Alex, is what will that government be?
[01:37:41.564 --> 01:38:01.473]  Well, that's the issue here, is that they always pitch it that we were hunter-gatherers, we were agrarian, we formed villages, then city-states, then nations, then empires, and the next phase is Star Trek, that we've been implanted with psychologically, the image of the global galactic empire, and we're always fighting green aliens, you know, the Klingons, so we've got to do this.
[01:38:01.873 --> 01:38:08.817]  The issue is, they built this world government in stealth, and denied that it existed.
[01:38:09.537 --> 01:38:11.718]  Until it was too late to really stop it.
[01:38:12.018 --> 01:38:15.139]  And now they're coming out going, yeah, we're going to tax everything you do.
[01:38:15.179 --> 01:38:16.859]  We're not going to let you have more than one kid.
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:21.381]  And yeah, we want to carry out eugenics on you, and we're going to carbon tax you.
[01:38:21.421 --> 01:38:29.804]  And Ban Ki-moon writes editorials saying the carbon tax is for the New World Order, and it's for a bunch of corrupt CEOs and bankers to play emperor.
[01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:38.927]  And so if the people of the world ever wanted to create a world government and it was democratic and under the republic system, then that would be one thing.
[01:38:39.487 --> 01:38:44.709]  But this thing was created by a corrupt group of criminals and it's a world tyranny.
[01:38:44.969 --> 01:38:55.993]  That's why every ounce of my body and being, just like Thomas Jefferson said, I swear eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny over the minds of men.
[01:38:56.513 --> 01:38:58.194]  And Jesse, I know you,
[01:38:58.954 --> 01:39:00.155]  I mean, don't you swear?
[01:39:00.455 --> 01:39:02.456]  Alex, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
[01:39:02.516 --> 01:39:04.638]  I'm not going to dispute anything you've said.
[01:39:04.658 --> 01:39:06.299]  I won't.
[01:39:06.919 --> 01:39:12.462]  But the point is, and you're correct, if it was so good, why would they do it in secret?
[01:39:12.663 --> 01:39:15.204]  And that's a very, very valid point to make.
[01:39:16.365 --> 01:39:27.732]  But the point we have to make, if it's inevitable that we're going to come under one world rule, then we the people have to ensure that we're players in the game, that we have dogs in the fight.
[01:39:29.298 --> 01:39:31.621]  But I don't want to be under the Communist Chinese.
[01:39:31.641 --> 01:39:33.843]  Alex is making sure we got a dog in the fight.
[01:39:34.424 --> 01:39:35.265]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:39:35.805 --> 01:39:41.852]  But instead, so we never have a dog in the fight, they just say there isn't a world government, meet your world government.
[01:39:42.152 --> 01:39:47.638]  I mean, they're still saying world government doesn't exist, so that we can never demand representation.
[01:39:47.759 --> 01:39:50.562]  Well, what was interesting was I was out at that new Denver airport,
[01:39:52.176 --> 01:39:52.416]  Right?
[01:39:52.456 --> 01:39:53.517]  The new one in Denver?
[01:39:53.877 --> 01:39:54.138]  Yes.
[01:39:54.358 --> 01:40:01.563]  And on the plaque that they have out there, on the bottom of it, it says the New World Airport Commission.
[01:40:02.784 --> 01:40:03.765]  And there isn't one.
[01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:08.453]  Nothing, nothing of that name is in existence.
[01:40:08.833 --> 01:40:10.515]  And there's murals of Nazis.
[01:40:10.575 --> 01:40:14.978]  How would they put that on the dedication plaque at that big Denver airport?
[01:40:15.039 --> 01:40:15.899]  The New World.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:23.466]  Not the Colorado Airport Commission, not the Denver Airport Commission, but the New World Airport Commission.
[01:40:24.006 --> 01:40:27.509]  And they have paintings of Nazis killing children above it.
[01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:29.011]  Also, they're not Nazis.
[01:40:30.332 --> 01:40:31.333]  I disprove that.
[01:40:32.927 --> 01:40:35.408]  Well, there's people in fascist-style uniforms mowing people down.
[01:40:35.428 --> 01:40:36.788]  Right, but they are not Nazis.
[01:40:36.808 --> 01:40:38.489]  You know how I disproved that, Alex?
[01:40:39.089 --> 01:40:39.329]  How?
[01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:41.089]  The guy's carrying an AK-47.
[01:40:41.610 --> 01:40:43.190]  I saw it right away.
[01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:44.730]  I said, this can't be a Nazi.
[01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:46.331]  The Nazis didn't have that weapon.
[01:40:46.691 --> 01:40:51.232]  Yeah, but I don't think the artist knows that the Kalashnikov is an Eastern Bloc weapon.
[01:40:51.272 --> 01:40:54.153]  Well, I noticed it.
[01:40:54.213 --> 01:40:56.074]  Hey, Jesse, I want to take some calls in time.
[01:40:56.094 --> 01:40:56.614]  Yes, let's do it.
[01:40:57.847 --> 01:41:00.790]  But, but, a plug right here in the middle of this conversation.
[01:41:01.231 --> 01:41:12.183]  I'm going to mail you, I've forgotten to mail you, Fall of the Republic, because this details from the globalist's own statements that they are setting up a tyrannical world government, that they engineered the banking crisis by...
[01:41:12.884 --> 01:41:17.790]  The crisis by design and that they are setting up a citizen spy force police state system.
[01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:30.005]  So I hope all the listeners will get a copy of Follow the Republic at InfoWars.com and the online video bookstore and support what we're doing here, but also show it to everyone you know, because this film exposes the wider agenda.
[01:41:30.245 --> 01:41:44.697]  And Alex, let me shamelessly add in, please watch my television show, because if we get such an overwhelming audience response, it'll force them to buy it up for another deal, and we'll be able to get that much farther into it then.
[01:41:45.138 --> 01:41:48.761]  And then, like the X-Files, I get the spinoff like the lone gunman.
[01:41:49.281 --> 01:41:49.842]  There you go.
[01:41:50.939 --> 01:41:52.961]  Okay, now we're getting into real inside baseball.
[01:41:53.682 --> 01:42:01.209]  Look, this show is important, and I want everybody to tell their friends and family and neighbors, True TV, December 2nd, airing every Wednesday.
[01:42:01.829 --> 01:42:06.634]  Absolutely important, because this show is definitely from our perspective.
[01:42:06.834 --> 01:42:09.316]  Okay, I want to go to some calls, but we've got to finish up with the last point.
[01:42:09.657 --> 01:42:12.820]  We just hit Manchurian Canada, Secret Societies.
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:13.841]  What about Big Brother?
[01:42:14.081 --> 01:42:14.681]  You talked it...
[01:42:15.702 --> 01:42:18.585]  Well, Big Brother is just simply that.
[01:42:18.686 --> 01:42:20.688]  Big Brother, are they watching over you?
[01:42:20.788 --> 01:42:31.699]  And I think in our show, you're going to hear clearly that they are, and that clearly it's going to come from a place where the government is able to do it and work around the Constitution.
[01:42:37.546 --> 01:42:48.312]  We have found that out and we will air that on the show to where you will clearly see how the government has looped the Constitution in which establishing Big Brother on you.
[01:42:51.573 --> 01:42:54.475]  Can we say the different federal groups you talk to or just leave that alone?
[01:42:55.723 --> 01:42:58.065]  I don't think I talked to any federal groups again.
[01:42:58.105 --> 01:43:00.347]  There was no cooperation from the government at all.
[01:43:00.367 --> 01:43:01.768]  Well, you talked to their minions, though.
[01:43:01.808 --> 01:43:06.311]  You talked to their Gestapo, their ground pounders, their citizen spies.
[01:43:06.691 --> 01:43:08.092]  Well, yes, we did do that.
[01:43:09.233 --> 01:43:10.234]  We'll just leave it there.
[01:43:10.454 --> 01:43:11.255]  We'll just leave it there.
[01:43:11.295 --> 01:43:12.415]  Yeah, just leave it at that.
[01:43:13.356 --> 01:43:17.479]  Well, it's a very exciting... Too many of them are right down in your country, Alex.
[01:43:17.579 --> 01:43:18.840]  I don't want you getting in trouble.
[01:43:20.301 --> 01:43:22.783]  Believe me, we know what InfraGard is up to.
[01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:31.704]  Okay, folks, Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:43:31.804 --> 01:43:41.752]  Best-selling author, wrestler, movie star, governor, football, National Football League, NFL commentator, surfer.
[01:43:42.312 --> 01:43:44.054]  Jesse, what is there you haven't done?
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:49.743]  Uh, I don't know, but I got a few years to figure it out yet, Alex.
[01:43:49.884 --> 01:43:57.131]  I, uh, you know, you never stop going because, uh, you know, in the words of the late, great Warren Zavon, I'll sleep when I'm dead.
[01:43:58.049 --> 01:43:59.370]  Program note to stations.
[01:43:59.390 --> 01:44:00.892]  This is a network break coming up.
[01:44:00.932 --> 01:44:04.636]  We're going right to the bottom of the hour, 29 after.
[01:44:04.736 --> 01:44:06.858]  We're going to let the governor go here.
[01:44:06.898 --> 01:44:13.345]  So we're going to take calls right now for the last 12 minutes or so with Governor Jesse Ventura, giving you the inside scoop.
[01:44:13.365 --> 01:44:16.589]  Jesse, why did you give this show first, the inside scoop?
[01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:19.391]  I was very honored when you called me and said you were going to give us the exclusive.
[01:44:19.432 --> 01:44:19.512]  Why?
[01:44:19.892 --> 01:44:21.373]  For a number of reasons, Alex.
[01:44:21.393 --> 01:44:26.215]  Your participation in the show was exceptional and we appreciated it.
[01:44:26.775 --> 01:44:28.196]  You know, you flew out to L.A.
[01:44:28.236 --> 01:44:32.357]  a couple times and all that to participate, and so why not?
[01:44:32.457 --> 01:44:37.540]  I reward the people that reward me, and so that's a reason for it.
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:37.880]  Plus,
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:43.345]  You have the listening audience, the base market that this show is designed for.
[01:44:43.406 --> 01:44:51.374]  I would be crazy not to come on your show with my show because, you know, I'm not going to lie, we're out for success on this show.
[01:44:51.394 --> 01:44:52.976]  I hope the show is hugely successful.
[01:44:53.636 --> 01:44:56.117]  Yeah, but I know the TV shows you turn down.
[01:44:56.137 --> 01:45:02.638]  I mean, I don't know if you want to say it, but you're turning down something with 30 million viewers coming up in a few weeks because you want to be out of the country.
[01:45:02.658 --> 01:45:09.320]  I'm just really honored you came because I know you're turning down a bunch of really huge media interviews, but doing our show, so we appreciate it.
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:10.560]  Well, no problem.
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:22.863]  And like I said, you know, you're a wealth of information, Alex, that we can always rely upon, and you know, so doing your show is just simply the left hand washing the right hand.
[01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:26.938]  Well, folks, we're going to post this interview up at InfoWars.com.
[01:45:26.958 --> 01:45:29.139]  Over 200,000 people a day get the free podcast.
[01:45:29.179 --> 01:45:30.179]  Get it, share it with everybody.
[01:45:30.439 --> 01:45:32.040]  We're going to post a YouTube video of it.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:32.860]  Share it with everyone.
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:41.143]  Because if this show can be a big success, the system may start letting more of this on the air as the internet culture takes over the mainstream media.
[01:45:41.463 --> 01:45:43.404]  We can beat the globalists.
[01:45:43.504 --> 01:45:48.346]  If they can't beat us, they're going to try to join us and we can slow down this whole system.
[01:45:48.866 --> 01:45:50.146]  That's what Tweety Bird always said.
[01:45:50.186 --> 01:45:51.227]  If you can't beat them, join them.
[01:45:52.367 --> 01:45:55.089]  Well, if we can beat them, they're going to have to back off.
[01:45:55.409 --> 01:45:58.532]  And believing we can expose these people is half the battle.
[01:45:58.592 --> 01:46:00.513]  Believing you can win, or as G.I.
[01:46:00.533 --> 01:46:02.015]  Joe says, knowing is half the battle.
[01:46:02.055 --> 01:46:03.616]  I believe taking action is half the battle.
[01:46:03.996 --> 01:46:05.057]  Resistance is victory.
[01:46:05.357 --> 01:46:07.419]  Matt in Illinois, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[01:46:07.439 --> 01:46:08.039]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.921]  Hello, Mr. Ventura.
[01:46:10.361 --> 01:46:11.182]  Hi Matt, how you doing?
[01:46:12.162 --> 01:46:12.623]  Pretty good.
[01:46:13.824 --> 01:46:15.905]  I wanted to know, I don't have a TV.
[01:46:16.386 --> 01:46:22.070]  I gave up watching TV a long, long time ago because I didn't like being treated like I was stupid.
[01:46:22.918 --> 01:46:42.577]  And it sounds like you've got a really good show, and I'd like to know if there's any plans to put it on the web or somehow that I'll be able to watch it without having to... I don't know at this time, but then again, I'm not a good web person to talk to, but I certainly will inquire to find out what the options are about doing it over the web or whatever.
[01:46:42.617 --> 01:46:43.137]  I don't know.
[01:46:43.197 --> 01:46:48.002]  But at this time, the only thing I know is we're going to be on true TV starting December 2nd.
[01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:49.731]  Yeah, Matt, thanks for the call.
[01:46:49.811 --> 01:46:50.592]  I'll tell you this.
[01:46:51.232 --> 01:46:54.735]  Time Warner is putting a lot of their stuff on YouTube now.
[01:46:54.815 --> 01:46:57.617]  Most TV shows are there after the series runs.
[01:46:58.177 --> 01:47:00.199]  Then it's up there with commercials on YouTube.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:03.041]  I would imagine this is made for the Internet.
[01:47:03.141 --> 01:47:07.164]  I would imagine you're going to be able to see it officially on the Internet after it airs on TV.
[01:47:07.204 --> 01:47:08.545]  Go to a neighbor's house and watch it.
[01:47:09.266 --> 01:47:11.187]  Let's talk, you know, the mind control box.
[01:47:11.207 --> 01:47:13.769]  We're going to use the mind control box to deprogram people.
[01:47:14.170 --> 01:47:16.852]  Mary Ann in Iowa, you're on the air with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:47:16.872 --> 01:47:17.192]  Go ahead.
[01:47:17.904 --> 01:47:18.904]  Hi, it's a pleasure.
[01:47:19.445 --> 01:47:24.847]  I just want to say I hope this wakes up the American people and I praise you for doing that.
[01:47:25.467 --> 01:47:28.569]  I wanted to answer a quick question and then make a quick comment.
[01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:46.717]  Representative Mike Pence from Indiana, Republican, the other day I was watching the health voting on C-SPAN and he said, and I wrote it down because I was freaked out by it, he said, it seems a few elite in a far distant country can run our lives for us.
[01:47:47.436 --> 01:47:57.464]  And I, you know, immediately I thought of Build-A-Burger, not that, and I was going to ask you, which I think you've already answered, were you going to do a show on the Build-A-Burgers and the secret societies?
[01:47:57.484 --> 01:47:58.325]  You didn't answer that.
[01:47:58.365 --> 01:48:02.729]  Hold on, you mean Senator DeMint admitted that foreign bankers run our country?
[01:48:02.749 --> 01:48:03.629]  I mean, that's amazing.
[01:48:04.190 --> 01:48:11.115]  His quote, and I wrote it down, it seems a few elite in a far-distance country can run our lives for us.
[01:48:11.195 --> 01:48:12.737]  Okay, let's get Jesse's take on that.
[01:48:13.436 --> 01:48:23.742]  Well, there's certainly that possibility, and yes, we definitely do a show on the Build-A-Burgers, which I was happily kind of, I knew of them, but I didn't know as much about them.
[01:48:23.802 --> 01:48:26.204]  And here's the interesting little sidebar for it.
[01:48:26.884 --> 01:48:32.748]  We have a... Governor, are you still there?
[01:48:34.829 --> 01:48:35.169]  See that?
[01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:36.590]  I know that sound.
[01:48:36.630 --> 01:48:37.191]  That's us.
[01:48:37.791 --> 01:48:39.132]  That wasn't Ron Paul the other day.
[01:48:40.933 --> 01:48:41.153]  Okay?
[01:48:41.593 --> 01:48:42.573]  That's our phone system.
[01:48:42.593 --> 01:48:43.433]  I want that on record.
[01:48:45.274 --> 01:48:47.394]  Tell you, it's like living in a clown house or something.
[01:48:50.735 --> 01:48:52.515]  Just call him back and let him finish his point.
[01:48:55.236 --> 01:48:57.396]  It's always when I got huge guests on too.
[01:48:57.836 --> 01:49:03.857]  Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, and the standard operating procedure.
[01:49:03.897 --> 01:49:05.898]  Hell, I can call him on my cell phone and get him on that way.
[01:49:09.824 --> 01:49:15.228]  We've got General Stubblebine coming up with Dr. Rima Labo.
[01:49:15.569 --> 01:49:20.392]  Part two of the interview we started last week.
[01:49:25.877 --> 01:49:28.979]  And I do have a lot of other news that we're going to be covering as well.
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:32.342]  But hey, it's the miracle of technology, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:32.362 --> 01:49:38.267]  50 years ago, 60, 70, 80 years ago, you couldn't even do stuff like this.
[01:49:43.619 --> 01:49:48.321]  And that's kind of the hallmark of this show now.
[01:49:48.461 --> 01:49:49.282]  That's what we do.
[01:49:49.302 --> 01:49:50.482]  That's how we do it.
[01:49:51.583 --> 01:49:55.365]  Okay, Governor, got you cut off there when you were going to add a point about Bilderberg.
[01:49:55.405 --> 01:49:55.785]  Go ahead.
[01:49:55.865 --> 01:49:59.006]  It was either that, Alex, or they're cutting us off now.
[01:49:59.046 --> 01:49:59.827]  They're on to us.
[01:50:01.607 --> 01:50:07.490]  You know, what I was going to add was that just a simple sidelight to the show and then I got to run.
[01:50:10.186 --> 01:50:24.477]  We were interviewing a gentleman on the Bilderberg episode, and he had to travel from Europe to do the interview with me in New York, and we had to delay it a day, because when he went to the airport, he was on the no-fly list.
[01:50:25.838 --> 01:50:29.261]  Now, this person's not a terrorist.
[01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:32.544]  Why would he be on the no-fly list, and who has the power to do that?
[01:50:35.111 --> 01:50:37.273]  Well, that happens to even congressmen now.
[01:50:37.293 --> 01:50:41.336]  They get crosswise and you're not charged.
[01:50:41.396 --> 01:50:43.038]  There's no judge, there's no jury.
[01:50:43.478 --> 01:50:46.340]  And now they're saying if you have bad credit, you'll be on the no-fly list.
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:49.062]  Or if you're on the no-fly list, you won't be able to buy a gun.
[01:50:49.583 --> 01:50:54.487]  So you're not convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor or a parking ticket, Governor, but then you lose your rights.
[01:50:54.867 --> 01:50:59.211]  Isn't that 180 degrees the opposite from our republic form of government?
[01:50:59.791 --> 01:51:17.311]  I would like to think so, and as I said earlier, Alex, it's just the case of the big brother, and in this case it was dealing with the Bilderbergs that we had this particular guy we were going to interview, and he was coming from a foreign country to here, and he was on the no-fly list over there.
[01:51:18.522 --> 01:51:32.212]  And, to my knowledge, he's not a terrorist, so, you know, it's interesting how they'll disrupt people's lives by putting him on this no-fly list if you simply are of, say, a different political persuasion or whatever it might be.
[01:51:32.932 --> 01:51:38.176]  Well, Governor, you've got to get to a meeting in downtown Minneapolis, so we've only got four more minutes left with you.
[01:51:38.636 --> 01:51:40.418]  Let's take two final calls quickly.
[01:51:40.498 --> 01:51:42.499]  Gary in Washington, then Mark in Minnesota.
[01:51:42.799 --> 01:51:44.341]  Gary, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:46.182]  Pleasure to be here with you.
[01:51:46.954 --> 01:51:51.975]  I have a very important piece of information for the Governor, and I have a big question for both of you.
[01:51:52.715 --> 01:51:58.397]  First piece of information, ShakeMaps is a product of U.S.
[01:51:58.417 --> 01:52:01.018]  Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program.
[01:52:01.058 --> 01:52:14.601]  If you look at the ShakeMap in Sichuan, when the earthquake happened with a rainbow over China on May 20, 2008, the ShakeMap is the exact same shape as the HAARP weapon.
[01:52:15.646 --> 01:52:18.328]  That's point number one, and then I'll get to point number two.
[01:52:18.989 --> 01:52:20.210]  Okay, what's your final point?
[01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:21.311]  Because we've got to go here in a minute.
[01:52:22.271 --> 01:52:24.413]  Okay, so check out the ShakeMap's final point.
[01:52:24.794 --> 01:52:27.556]  There's too much fragmentation on the InfoWar.
[01:52:28.016 --> 01:52:32.780]  Prison Planet, Birthers, Oath Keepers, 9-11 Truth, Audit the Fed, LP, Gun Owners, Skywatch.
[01:52:33.541 --> 01:52:35.022]  I would recommend both of you
[01:52:35.603 --> 01:52:42.146]  Sir, we can't do it all.
[01:52:42.246 --> 01:52:42.846]  Hold on a minute.
[01:52:42.946 --> 01:52:47.428]  People act like Jesse Ventura or Alex Jones or Ron Paul have magical powers.
[01:52:47.488 --> 01:52:50.310]  We put our pants on one leg at a time, too.
[01:52:50.710 --> 01:52:52.110]  Freedom is fractured.
[01:52:52.190 --> 01:52:55.972]  It's good that we're not all unified because that makes us hard to stop.
[01:52:56.472 --> 01:52:57.533]  Governor, your comment on that?
[01:52:57.933 --> 01:53:00.975]  Well, and the other thing is, too, is that how do you do it?
[01:53:01.055 --> 01:53:10.900]  It's like when I was the third party candidate in Minnesota, I tried to bring all the third parties together so we could consolidate and become a force against the other two parties.
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:15.102]  I got news for you, it's like herding cats.
[01:53:15.462 --> 01:53:20.985]  And I couldn't even bring them together on an issue that we all agreed upon, and that was campaign finance.
[01:53:21.205 --> 01:53:23.406]  None of us, none of us took dirty money.
[01:53:24.424 --> 01:53:36.375]  And it just fractured like nothing and so I just threw my hands up in the air and I said it may be impossible, but I think Alex makes a great point that they can't stop us all if we're all coming at them from different directions.
[01:53:37.016 --> 01:53:38.497]  Yeah, it's a spirit of liberty.
[01:53:38.677 --> 01:53:40.879]  Shrink government, bring accountability.
[01:53:40.959 --> 01:53:45.143]  Final call for Governor Jesse Ventura from his home state, Minnesota.
[01:53:45.444 --> 01:53:46.244]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:53:46.284 --> 01:53:46.625]  Go ahead.
[01:53:47.523 --> 01:53:48.303]  Hi, you can hear me?
[01:53:48.683 --> 01:53:49.524]  Yes I can, go ahead.
[01:53:49.544 --> 01:53:49.984]  Hi Mark.
[01:53:50.284 --> 01:53:50.484]  Hi.
[01:53:50.504 --> 01:53:52.445]  Hi, I voted for you, Jesse.
[01:53:52.485 --> 01:53:53.846]  I appreciate both of you guys' work.
[01:53:54.026 --> 01:53:56.707]  And quickly, I have a couple questions.
[01:53:56.747 --> 01:53:58.207]  I can't wait for your show to come out.
[01:53:58.548 --> 01:53:59.588]  I'll look forward to watching that.
[01:54:00.328 --> 01:54:02.109]  And I'll tell people about it, my friends and whatnot.
[01:54:02.789 --> 01:54:04.050]  A couple ideas for the show.
[01:54:04.090 --> 01:54:16.495]  Maybe you could look into the patent issue where people, individuals developing free energy and anti-gravity technology that the government then deems a national security risk.
[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:21.762]  You know, Jesse, that's a great idea if it gets picked up for another season, is look at Cold Fusion.
[01:54:22.042 --> 01:54:25.444]  We'll take that into consideration, but we've got to get picked up first.
[01:54:25.544 --> 01:54:27.124]  We only did seven for right now.
[01:54:27.424 --> 01:54:31.246]  Yeah, we've got to cross that bridge before we... We have to come to that bridge before we cross it.
[01:54:31.646 --> 01:54:32.506]  Anything else, Mark?
[01:54:33.567 --> 01:54:34.147]  Yeah, one last thing.
[01:54:34.187 --> 01:54:41.230]  I just saw an article in the WorldNet Daily about data centers being set up by the NSA and Homeland Security Department.
[01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:42.891]  And I'm very concerned about that.
[01:54:42.931 --> 01:54:46.012]  They collect all our information, all communications and stored
[01:54:50.025 --> 01:54:58.916]  Watch my show on his big brother watching and all that, and you'll learn how they get away with it and how they loop the Constitution to do it.
[01:54:59.366 --> 01:55:00.447]  Thank you so much, Mark.
[01:55:00.507 --> 01:55:01.848]  Okay, we got a minute and a half left.
[01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:04.930]  Governor, I'm going to say bye to you when we go to break, so just hold one moment.
[01:55:04.951 --> 01:55:07.513]  But I wanted to say in closing, it's been great working with you.
[01:55:07.993 --> 01:55:09.014]  I hope the show airs.
[01:55:09.074 --> 01:55:09.975]  Looks like it is.
[01:55:10.375 --> 01:55:11.416]  They've started promoting it.
[01:55:11.456 --> 01:55:13.898]  They're unleashing you to promote it, so I think that's the green light.
[01:55:13.938 --> 01:55:20.143]  But as you said, we won't believe it airs until we see it go on December 2nd on TruTV, so spread the word.
[01:55:20.563 --> 01:55:24.745]  But did you ever think, because I know all about this stuff and I still can't believe it.
[01:55:25.105 --> 01:55:26.266]  I'm still flabbergasted.
[01:55:26.446 --> 01:55:29.168]  I am psychologically speechless a lot of times.
[01:55:29.228 --> 01:55:32.710]  I can still babble some words out, but it's hard to articulate.
[01:55:33.230 --> 01:55:35.591]  The NSA says they're taking over the whole internet.
[01:55:35.611 --> 01:55:38.933]  They may shut it down during crises like bird flu or swine flu.
[01:55:39.413 --> 01:55:42.675]  The NSA is going to intercept all internet traffic.
[01:55:42.975 --> 01:55:49.859]  They're building NSA centers in San Antonio and New York and Florida and Minnesota and California and just admitting
[01:55:50.239 --> 01:55:51.642]  They're reading everything we're doing.
[01:55:51.802 --> 01:55:58.778]  So they go from, we're not spying on Al-Qaeda, to we are spying on Al-Qaeda, to we're spying on you, and we don't need those stinking warrants.
[01:55:58.818 --> 01:56:00.181]  Did you ever think that would happen?
[01:56:01.027 --> 01:56:07.635]  Well, it will happen because, yeah, I can believe it happening, Alex, because of apathetic people out there.
[01:56:08.176 --> 01:56:10.899]  People cannot be apathetic any longer.
[01:56:10.979 --> 01:56:12.981]  You can't sit on your hands anymore.
[01:56:13.522 --> 01:56:20.070]  You can't sit back and have government tell you they're going to protect you, but in lieu of that protection, you're going to give up your freedoms.
[01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:26.052]  You are better off to be in danger from terrorists than you are to lose your freedoms.
[01:56:26.573 --> 01:56:32.255]  Don't let them take your freedoms and always remember dissension is the greatest form of patriotism.
[01:56:32.795 --> 01:56:34.956]  Governor Jesse Ventura, amazing having you on.
[01:56:34.996 --> 01:56:36.077]  That's a great way to end it.
[01:56:37.537 --> 01:56:38.458]  We're on the march.
[01:56:38.938 --> 01:56:40.538]  The empire's on the run.
[01:56:41.459 --> 01:56:44.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:53.372]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:56:53.492 --> 01:56:55.453]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:56:55.593 --> 01:56:57.714]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:56:57.834 --> 01:56:59.354]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:56:59.474 --> 01:57:03.796]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:57:34.317 --> 01:57:36.238]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:57:46.325 --> 01:57:50.567]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:57:50.887 --> 01:57:54.950]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:55.210 --> 01:58:00.613]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:58:00.973 --> 01:58:01.413]  It's true.
[01:58:01.713 --> 01:58:06.276]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:58:06.576 --> 01:58:07.117]  Number 3.
[01:58:07.397 --> 01:58:10.680]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:14.723]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:58:14.903 --> 01:58:15.163]  Number 4.
[01:58:15.704 --> 01:58:18.086]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:58:18.466 --> 01:58:21.869]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.350]  Number 5.
[01:58:22.930 --> 01:58:26.851]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:58:27.071 --> 01:58:31.833]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:58:32.113 --> 01:58:36.155]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:58:36.295 --> 01:58:37.875]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:58:38.075 --> 01:58:42.677]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:53.728]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[01:58:54.028 --> 01:58:59.294]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[01:59:00.115 --> 01:59:02.778]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:59:03.058 --> 01:59:08.985]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:59:09.345 --> 01:59:13.210]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:59:13.410 --> 01:59:18.776]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:59:19.016 --> 01:59:20.856]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:59:21.096 --> 01:59:22.497]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:59:22.857 --> 01:59:25.117]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:59:25.377 --> 01:59:29.738]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:59:30.098 --> 01:59:33.479]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:59:33.819 --> 01:59:36.440]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:38.360]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:40.941]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:59:54.189 --> 02:00:00.895]  All right, coming up in about 10 minutes, we got Major General Albert N. Stubblebine and Dr. Rima Labo joining us.
[02:00:00.935 --> 02:00:06.299]  They've been at the Codex Alimentarius UN global government takeover of your vitamins and food meeting.
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:09.362]  The globalists are moving on every front taking over right now.
[02:00:09.762 --> 02:00:13.946]  Was that not an incredible Jesse Ventura interview in the last hour and a half?
[02:00:15.421 --> 02:00:33.267]  We put some traces on the phone lines for the phone company because we're only dropping big guests and our phone system creates a certain blip when the phones drop but we can check the phone logs from here and we put a trace in with the phone company.
[02:00:33.508 --> 02:00:37.089]  Our phone lines are being dropped in between us in Washington
[02:00:38.371 --> 02:00:41.374]  Our office in Minnesota and it's only with big guests.
[02:00:41.394 --> 02:00:44.757]  This is not happening with other regular phone lines we have.
[02:00:44.797 --> 02:00:47.099]  These are regular phone lines and we have internet phone lines.
[02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:49.841]  And I don't want to say it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:00:51.223 --> 02:00:54.526]  Though we have been officially hacked many times or attempted to be hacked.
[02:00:54.866 --> 02:01:01.152]  And we have found big hacking sites saying they're going to hack us again because we don't like Obama.
[02:01:01.212 --> 02:01:04.194]  We're fascists because we don't like expanding the wars.
[02:01:05.114 --> 02:01:06.575]  But then we track those groups.
[02:01:07.296 --> 02:01:13.961]  Those are government operatives posing as if they're hackers because we've had top hackers give us the documentation on this.
[02:01:14.842 --> 02:01:21.047]  We've got the Pentagon directing denial of service attacks, a bunch of other types of attacks against us.
[02:01:22.448 --> 02:01:25.631]  The last big one was when we were exposing that
[02:01:26.872 --> 02:01:35.717]  The flu was a fraud and part of a larger drill and that they had prepared all this back in January when we told you they were getting ready for a staged flu hysteria.
[02:01:36.778 --> 02:01:50.025]  We said we don't know if it's a hoax or whether it's going to be real but in January and February I said they're going to stage something big this year and we had city managers and emergency managers on and got secret documents on air for you and it all came true.
[02:01:52.281 --> 02:01:53.622]  Because we have the sources!
[02:01:54.363 --> 02:01:56.926]  I mean, we're risking our lives here for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:58.447 --> 02:01:59.408]  This is not a game.
[02:01:59.428 --> 02:02:00.329]  This is not a joke.
[02:02:07.016 --> 02:02:08.898]  Without giving too much of the TV show away.
[02:02:11.701 --> 02:02:16.164]  Well, I know who it was that was on the no-fly list as soon as they tried to fly here for the interview.
[02:02:16.504 --> 02:02:20.226]  And the government's listening to these people's phone lines and just doing it for meetings.
[02:02:20.566 --> 02:02:26.730]  We have sent videotapes to media before, and they have erased the tape.
[02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:30.432]  They have a system that sends out these electronic waves that erases tapes.
[02:02:31.272 --> 02:02:33.073]  Anybody who's worked in a TV station knows about them.
[02:02:33.674 --> 02:02:34.814]  Forget the technical term.
[02:02:35.575 --> 02:02:38.136]  Back in the old days of regular tape and video, they have them.
[02:02:38.496 --> 02:02:40.838]  Well, they'll erase a regular computer tape, too.
[02:02:43.613 --> 02:02:45.274]  They've got other systems that'll erase hard drives.
[02:02:45.294 --> 02:02:46.175]  It's a big magnet.
[02:02:48.057 --> 02:02:53.641]  But the point is, they did that twice once, then they broke into a hotel room.
[02:02:53.981 --> 02:02:57.764]  I've had them break into hotel rooms I'm in and steal Just Start tapes.
[02:03:02.368 --> 02:03:08.593]  Well, I was talking about this a few weeks ago because I buy movies on DVD to watch them when I run on the treadmill.
[02:03:09.014 --> 02:03:11.676]  Only way I can run more than 30 minutes is to watch a movie.
[02:03:12.679 --> 02:03:15.680]  I can go out on the street and start running and like 20 minutes later I just stop.
[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:18.901]  But I can get on that treadmill and go into zombie mode.
[02:03:19.261 --> 02:03:23.862]  I guess I use the mind control device to trick myself into running more than 30 minutes.
[02:03:26.482 --> 02:03:32.724]  When you got as fat as I did at 260 pounds down to 230 now trying to lose more weight.
[02:03:32.744 --> 02:03:34.084]  It gets tougher once you lose that first 30.
[02:03:37.565 --> 02:03:38.205]  Side issue.
[02:03:38.806 --> 02:03:40.186]  Point is, I'm on the treadmill.
[02:03:42.301 --> 02:03:44.403]  And I watch in two parts the insider.
[02:03:45.183 --> 02:03:46.064]  And that's a true story.
[02:03:47.005 --> 02:03:52.189]  Of all the harassment he went through and all the things that happened to him, a tobacco company scientist going public.
[02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:54.071]  Man, that's a cakewalk!
[02:03:55.332 --> 02:04:02.058]  And the reason they haven't killed me, and the reason they don't do a lot of stuff to me anymore, they still do some things, is because they know I don't care.
[02:04:02.678 --> 02:04:04.480]  I mean, I care, but what am I going to do?
[02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:07.562]  It's kind of like once you jump out of an airplane with a parachute.
[02:04:08.023 --> 02:04:09.164]  Is your parachute going to open?
[02:04:09.584 --> 02:04:10.445]  You sure hope so!
[02:04:12.423 --> 02:04:13.203]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:04:13.223 --> 02:04:22.328]  And there's such a liberating feeling about going, gee, I hope they don't hurt my wife or kids.
[02:04:22.388 --> 02:04:25.750]  Gee, I hope they don't kill me or destroy me in the media or set me up.
[02:04:26.770 --> 02:04:30.352]  It's kind of nice that they're just doing COINTELPRO against me and making stuff up.
[02:04:32.423 --> 02:04:36.664]  And I kind of let him do that as like, okay, you get to do that.
[02:04:37.464 --> 02:04:38.664]  Thank you for not killing me.
[02:04:38.704 --> 02:04:48.106]  And I do want to say to the globalists, I know they've calculated all the angles and they think I'm buffoonish and that I discredit at certain levels, but now they figured out that's not really the case.
[02:04:48.146 --> 02:04:54.807]  And I do feel the wings of death flapping above my head and they're beginning to really analyze my true operation.
[02:04:56.008 --> 02:05:02.009]  But we're a little farther down the line now, aren't we, globalists?
[02:05:03.052 --> 02:05:10.094]  To where my information is out there and if you kill me, it's going to highlight, it's going to underline everything I've said and done.
[02:05:11.494 --> 02:05:13.255]  And so you're going to destroy me in the media.
[02:05:13.835 --> 02:05:21.517]  The problem is the media is so discredited that if you tell a bunch of lies about me, anybody who can think automatically supports me.
[02:05:23.898 --> 02:05:28.499]  I mean, yes, you've got buffoons fooled, you've got idiots fooled, you've got morons fooled,
[02:05:29.474 --> 02:05:42.687]  But anyone who can think, even if they disagree with me on some issues, Lord knows I make mistakes and I'm aggressive and bombastic and arrogant sometimes, but people who've got discernment and who've been around the world, they know I'm for real.
[02:05:43.828 --> 02:05:48.393]  They know even if I wasn't a good person and it wasn't for real, I'm waking a lot of people up.
[02:05:48.793 --> 02:05:51.256]  I mean, if I work for the government, man,
[02:05:53.049 --> 02:05:55.751]  This is the worst money they ever spent because we're hurting them, folks.
[02:05:55.972 --> 02:05:57.533]  We're teaching you you have power.
[02:05:57.733 --> 02:05:59.435]  We're teaching you you can affect change.
[02:05:59.695 --> 02:06:01.877]  We're teaching you that you can fight the New World Order.
[02:06:02.057 --> 02:06:03.719]  We're teaching you how their systems work.
[02:06:03.979 --> 02:06:06.581]  We're teaching you to unplug from their matrix.
[02:06:06.601 --> 02:06:09.083]  We're showing people how they can affect change.
[02:06:09.324 --> 02:06:11.606]  We're documenting our true form of government.
[02:06:13.267 --> 02:06:15.049]  The system hates us!
[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:22.604]  We're against bashing Jews and bashing Catholics and bashing blacks and bashing whites.
[02:06:23.265 --> 02:06:27.528]  I come out against the racist Hispanics and racist blacks when they're bashing white people.
[02:06:29.069 --> 02:06:30.950]  You know, we criticize corruption of Israel.
[02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:32.611]  We criticize corruption of China.
[02:06:32.892 --> 02:06:34.493]  But we don't hate Chinese people.
[02:06:36.933 --> 02:06:39.195]  We're here bringing people together.
[02:06:39.916 --> 02:06:43.018]  And that's why, you know, I thought about the magnitude of this last week.
[02:06:43.539 --> 02:06:54.989]  I thought, I haven't made a bigger deal over the fact that we can track the IP addresses of commenters and that these are coming from military bases and are government operatives.
[02:06:55.529 --> 02:06:57.731]  Many cases they put their handles up there.
[02:06:58.031 --> 02:07:01.114]  You can go to their MySpace or Facebook and they admit they're in psyops.
[02:07:05.407 --> 02:07:06.688]  I mean, this is getting crazy!
[02:07:08.849 --> 02:07:10.150]  They don't even care if we know.
[02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:24.259]  And then I think about how many white supremacists have been caught in federal court, the Southern Priory Law Center, Hal Turner, all of them, that attack me, and then it turns out they're feds staging stuff.
[02:07:24.459 --> 02:07:27.561]  Hal Turner, I told you six, seven years ago that guy was a fed.
[02:07:28.162 --> 02:07:30.683]  As if you couldn't take one micron
[02:07:34.155 --> 02:07:34.899]  Do we have our guest?
[02:07:35.644 --> 02:07:36.026]  Okay, good.
[02:07:37.133 --> 02:07:37.495]  As if!
[02:07:38.507 --> 02:07:43.210]  As if one micron of discernment wouldn't know he was a Fed.
[02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:54.938]  And then it comes out, he's attacking me, I'm his main target, that I work for Israel, and I'm bad, and I'm all this stuff, and everybody, if they really want to be a true blue American, has to hate Jews and obsess on that all day.
[02:07:55.979 --> 02:08:00.982]  Even if you believed that, when you go out and preach that, it destroys all your other arguments.
[02:08:01.262 --> 02:08:03.063]  I don't want cap-and-trade, but I hate Jews.
[02:08:03.524 --> 02:08:05.085]  Oh, I don't want socialist healthcare.
[02:08:05.185 --> 02:08:06.186]  I hate Jews, by the way.
[02:08:06.486 --> 02:08:08.127]  That totally destroys your argument.
[02:08:09.346 --> 02:08:10.646]  Well, I don't hate Jews.
[02:08:11.106 --> 02:08:13.427]  And I understand there are a lot of evil Jews involved in the New World Order.
[02:08:13.447 --> 02:08:14.687]  There's a lot of evil people, period.
[02:08:15.327 --> 02:08:18.328]  But Jews are competitive, smart, informed, educated people.
[02:08:18.588 --> 02:08:21.088]  Of course there's going to be a lot of evil people at the top that are Jewish.
[02:08:21.228 --> 02:08:23.088]  There's a lot of Brits at the top that are evil.
[02:08:23.248 --> 02:08:25.689]  Because British people, statistically, are very smart.
[02:08:25.929 --> 02:08:28.069]  And when you get evil ones on your hands, you've got a problem.
[02:08:28.849 --> 02:08:31.550]  I mean, it's the same thing with the Russian government.
[02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:33.370]  I'm not against Russian people.
[02:08:33.590 --> 02:08:34.810]  I'm against their corrupt government.
[02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:35.711]  I speak out against it.
[02:08:37.391 --> 02:08:38.091]  All right, look, look.
[02:08:43.527 --> 02:08:47.830]  People always think it's a conspiracy theory on TV when I hit the silence button and talk to them.
[02:08:48.071 --> 02:08:52.614]  We're gonna go to our guests in five minutes because I wasn't sure if we were gonna get them on and I have something else lined up.
[02:08:52.654 --> 02:08:53.795]  Ted Anderson's about to come on.
[02:08:54.556 --> 02:09:08.727]  The point here is I just realized that it's on record that all these top white supremacists get busted, get caught in federal court being federal informants or agents,
[02:09:09.892 --> 02:09:21.184]  They get caught in court cases and lawsuits and then admit when they kill their wife or beat up their neighbor or get in trouble, there's a whole bunch of them, or threaten the wrong state judge and get arrested.
[02:09:21.505 --> 02:09:27.171]  They then come out and say, I'm a Fed, I'm a Fed, and then Feds come in and go, well, he does work for us.
[02:09:27.932 --> 02:09:31.696]  Why would the Feds have all these different organizations and groups?
[02:09:33.374 --> 02:09:41.916]  Attacking me as working for Israel, or working for the Vatican, or working for this or that, and then it comes out they are feds.
[02:09:42.697 --> 02:09:46.058]  See, the feds want us all fighting with each other.
[02:09:46.998 --> 02:09:47.578]  They want that.
[02:09:48.018 --> 02:09:55.140]  Alright, we've got Major General Stubblebine and Dr. Rima Labo coming up with the balance of the radio show today with part two of their amazing interview with us last week.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:01.422]  They can report on the conclusion of what happened at the Codex Alimentarius in Europe.
[02:10:02.222 --> 02:10:04.363]  And so much more coming up in T-minus five minutes.
[02:10:04.403 --> 02:10:05.343]  Very honored to have them.
[02:10:05.363 --> 02:10:06.804]  We had some phone trouble getting them connected.
[02:10:07.164 --> 02:10:12.586]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up briefly because gold, as you know, went above $1,100 and has stayed there.
[02:10:13.466 --> 02:10:15.046]  And Ted is almost out.
[02:10:15.086 --> 02:10:16.867]  It's gone up three times in the last week.
[02:10:17.347 --> 02:10:18.688]  He's almost out of gold.
[02:10:19.648 --> 02:10:24.353]  That is, well yesterday, almost $60 less in the market than it is now.
[02:10:24.793 --> 02:10:30.739]  He's almost out of this, and it will go up in the next few days if the selling continues like this, and it clearly is.
[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:33.722]  Ted, briefly, give us an economic outlook on what's happening.
[02:10:34.003 --> 02:10:37.006]  Tell folks about the Midas Resources offer of the day.
[02:10:37.346 --> 02:10:41.330]  If people didn't listen to us when gold was $300 an ounce, it's now $1,100 plus.
[02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:42.431]  Maybe they'll listen now.
[02:10:43.152 --> 02:10:52.909]  Well, I hope so, Alex, because China and also India are trying to shore up their currencies with the amount of gold that they used to use, you know, to have against their currencies.
[02:10:53.230 --> 02:10:54.953]  That'll push gold up to $1,300 an ounce if that happens.
[02:10:56.912 --> 02:11:05.500]  If the United States decides to get its currency shored up with gold, we're going to be as high as $2,700 an ounce, just to go back to 71 level.
[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:07.562]  You know, that's what we're looking at right here.
[02:11:07.882 --> 02:11:10.024]  Gold right now is sitting at $1,105 an ounce.
[02:11:10.044 --> 02:11:12.266]  I still have the francs currently, right now, presently at the price of $246.
[02:11:12.526 --> 02:11:13.247]  British sovereigns are at $299.
[02:11:20.894 --> 02:11:24.497]  And I also have the Lakota coin at $22.30.
[02:11:24.997 --> 02:11:26.738]  Walking Liberty is $8.69.
[02:11:26.918 --> 02:11:28.019]  I mean, we have U.S.
[02:11:28.079 --> 02:11:30.160]  Eagles, we have junk silver bags.
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:34.723]  I mean, pretty much anything that you want to be getting into in the marketplace, we have it right here at Midas.
[02:11:35.004 --> 02:11:40.287]  The main thing is, is that you have to realize that the United States currency's value is under attack.
[02:11:40.647 --> 02:11:42.909]  There is simply no way that the U.S.
[02:11:42.989 --> 02:11:49.013]  currency is going to hold value when you have the United States government trying to solve its problems by printing money.
[02:11:49.213 --> 02:11:50.454]  It just doesn't work that way.
[02:11:52.483 --> 02:11:53.764]  Well, absolutely, Ted.
[02:11:54.025 --> 02:12:06.357]  And when you hear even Clark Howard, the economic guru, saying, OK, go ahead and get into gold, when you hear all the national shows saying $2,000 an ounce, that it's guaranteed, I'm not saying that.
[02:12:06.737 --> 02:12:09.420]  It's guaranteed gold has real intrinsic value.
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.146]  I believe it's going to keep going up in the next few years because the dollar, they've decided to devalue it and kill it.
[02:12:15.706 --> 02:12:27.689]  But it certainly is crazy at this point to not get into gold and silver, especially when you can get in a time machine and go back and buy it cheaper than it is now, because Ted is smart and buys in the dips.
[02:12:28.449 --> 02:12:29.769]  So this is a win-win-win.
[02:12:30.009 --> 02:12:31.029]  Those are great deals.
[02:12:31.069 --> 02:12:34.010]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones special to get the lower prices.
[02:12:34.050 --> 02:12:37.831]  You'll be paying a higher price that still is very competitive in this market.
[02:12:38.291 --> 02:12:41.773]  You know, Ted has got an A rating for a gold company.
[02:12:41.813 --> 02:12:43.754]  When you look at all the other gold companies, go check them.
[02:12:43.774 --> 02:12:46.595]  They have C+, C-, or Fs.
[02:12:47.076 --> 02:12:51.158]  Ted is a great company, great deals, super high quality.
[02:12:51.178 --> 02:12:54.459]  It's where I've chosen to buy gold and silver because I get the best deals.
[02:12:54.539 --> 02:12:55.780]  I get the deals you're getting.
[02:12:56.500 --> 02:12:59.242]  And these are just exceptional deals right now.
[02:12:59.562 --> 02:13:01.103]  Ted, give them the toll-free number.
[02:13:01.403 --> 02:13:03.265]  Yeah, you get a hold of Midas here at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:13:03.305 --> 02:13:03.646]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:13:03.666 --> 02:13:06.769]  And by all means, please let us know that you call off the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:18.047 --> 02:13:18.888]  Absolutely, Ted.
[02:13:18.928 --> 02:13:19.728]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:13:20.329 --> 02:13:29.576]  When they call, whether it's the bags of junk silver, or whether it's a maple leaf, or whether it's an American Eagle, or whether it's a buffalo, you've got a lot of stuff in right now.
[02:13:30.057 --> 02:13:33.359]  You tell them it's the Alex Jones special, and what type of discount do you get?
[02:13:33.659 --> 02:13:37.963]  Or is the Alex Jones special just on the francs, the sovereigns, and the silver half dollars?
[02:13:38.183 --> 02:13:39.044]  Let's put it this way.
[02:13:39.104 --> 02:13:47.654]  There are some coins that we're carrying right now that if you don't mention that you've heard it on the Alex Jones special, you could pay as much as $200 an ounce more.
[02:13:48.275 --> 02:13:50.938]  I mean, that's the materials that I'm putting aside.
[02:13:50.958 --> 02:13:54.322]  I mean, specifically, I told my sales staff
[02:13:54.722 --> 02:13:56.804]  That this is for this particular offer.
[02:13:57.104 --> 02:13:59.287]  You can't offer this to anybody else.
[02:13:59.487 --> 02:14:00.468]  You're going to have to do it here.
[02:14:00.488 --> 02:14:12.999]  So this is a blanket discount, but to focus in on that specific discount, because people are always calling me and trying to get me to explain it, and I have the internal sheets where it say it's a quarter ounce gold coin, and it was $224, and I would see your $4 or $5 markup.
[02:14:13.019 --> 02:14:13.540]  I mean, tiny.
[02:14:19.853 --> 02:14:28.164]  So explaining that, you buy when the market's lower, it would cost you more to buy these now than for what you're selling them.
[02:14:28.385 --> 02:14:29.606]  That's what the truth is.
[02:14:29.666 --> 02:14:37.397]  These same coins cost a lot more in the wholesale market because gold has jumped up over $50 an ounce in a week.
[02:14:38.161 --> 02:14:38.782]  And you know what?
[02:14:38.842 --> 02:14:46.969]  It's at $1,005 and I wouldn't be surprised a bit that if it jumps into that $1,150 range here very shortly.
[02:14:47.029 --> 02:14:49.111]  It's just, it's moving that direction.
[02:14:49.151 --> 02:14:52.234]  The United States dollar is under attack internationally.
[02:14:52.294 --> 02:14:53.415]  It's not just here now.
[02:14:55.481 --> 02:15:02.325]  As we add more liability to our government coffer, the federal printing press just turns on full speed.
[02:15:02.365 --> 02:15:07.288]  And what do you think's going to happen to the dollars we earned if we have to compete with money that's being created from nothing?
[02:15:07.308 --> 02:15:16.854]  Well, Chad, that's the point I'm trying to make, is that as the general public, because before, what, 3, 4, 5% maybe of the public physically held silver and gold?
[02:15:17.174 --> 02:15:20.657]  Now they're saying it's getting up to 6, 7, 8% and the price is exploding.
[02:15:21.197 --> 02:15:22.558]  As the yuppies find out,
[02:15:23.789 --> 02:15:24.229]  That's right.
[02:15:39.421 --> 02:15:42.362]  Stocks and bonds, they're going to want to hold physical gold.
[02:15:42.882 --> 02:15:49.845]  And what the economists talk about is as inflation kicks in globally, on top of this depression, that will drive commodities up.
[02:15:50.085 --> 02:15:50.826]  Oil's going up.
[02:15:51.646 --> 02:15:53.107]  All precious metals are going up.
[02:15:54.067 --> 02:15:57.628]  And so at least in the short term, gold is a win-win-win-win-win.
[02:15:59.409 --> 02:16:07.456]  The markets are so manipulated that it may hold for a while coming up here in the next few months, but then in the next year may rocket past $2,000.
[02:16:08.177 --> 02:16:08.737]  Who knows?
[02:16:09.118 --> 02:16:15.703]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, there's not a better investment any way you slice it than silver and gold if you get a good deal on it.
[02:16:16.064 --> 02:16:18.226]  Give Ted Anderson a call.
[02:16:18.806 --> 02:16:21.367]  They can tell you about the risk associated with it.
[02:16:21.387 --> 02:16:23.488]  Yeah, the risk is you won't make the huge profits.
[02:16:24.028 --> 02:16:26.249]  $300 gold five, six years ago.
[02:16:26.329 --> 02:16:27.209]  $1,100 now.
[02:16:27.429 --> 02:16:28.650]  But there still are some risks.
[02:16:28.850 --> 02:16:31.171]  There's risk if you drive your car, you can get run over today.
[02:16:31.451 --> 02:16:40.415]  The point is, the risks are a lot less, in my opinion, common sense opinion, in gold and silver than they are in the stinking stock market or in real estate or anything else.
[02:16:40.495 --> 02:16:46.117]  Folks, what do kings and queens and pirates and criminals, what do they have?
[02:16:46.417 --> 02:16:49.558]  The people that know, that are street smart, they have gold.
[02:16:49.898 --> 02:16:51.258]  They have their treasure chest.
[02:16:51.518 --> 02:16:53.599]  They have their hoard, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:53.899 --> 02:16:55.299]  It'll always be that way.
[02:16:55.399 --> 02:16:56.660]  It's always been that way.
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:57.520]  Metal.
[02:16:58.020 --> 02:16:59.381]  What's a dragon want to sit on?
[02:16:59.421 --> 02:17:00.581]  A big pile of gold.
[02:17:01.001 --> 02:17:03.462]  Ladies and gentlemen, what do the kings have in their hoards?
[02:17:03.542 --> 02:17:04.162]  Gold!
[02:17:04.482 --> 02:17:05.182]  For 6,000 years, gold!
[02:17:05.202 --> 02:17:05.342]  Gold!
[02:17:08.823 --> 02:17:08.983]  800-686-2237.
[02:17:09.003 --> 02:17:10.064]  800-686-2237.
[02:17:10.484 --> 02:17:17.088]  We told you you'd get gold five, six years ago.
[02:17:17.468 --> 02:17:19.529]  It's up four times what it was now.
[02:17:19.889 --> 02:17:22.790]  Right at four times, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:22.810 --> 02:17:24.731]  800-686-2237.
[02:17:24.911 --> 02:17:28.053]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:17:28.453 --> 02:17:29.574]  It's always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:17:30.094 --> 02:17:30.815]  800-686-2237.
[02:17:33.617 --> 02:17:34.398]  Gold.
[02:17:35.039 --> 02:17:35.699]  Silver.
[02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:36.560]  Metal.
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.061]  It comes out of the ground.
[02:17:38.121 --> 02:17:40.083]  It's God's true system of wealth.
[02:17:40.424 --> 02:17:42.726]  Not this fraud paper created by Madoff.
[02:17:42.746 --> 02:17:42.786]  800-686-2237.

[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:51.882]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:18:52.202 --> 02:18:55.224]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:18:55.464 --> 02:18:56.885]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:18:57.763 --> 02:19:00.244]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:19:00.604 --> 02:19:06.505]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:19:06.645 --> 02:19:11.666]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:19:11.807 --> 02:19:21.809]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:19:21.929 --> 02:19:22.570]  Tim Geithner?
[02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:23.250]  Bernanke?
[02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:24.031]  They're arsonists!
[02:19:24.271 --> 02:19:25.612]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:19:25.872 --> 02:19:28.134]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:19:28.334 --> 02:19:30.176]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:19:30.456 --> 02:19:35.220]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:20:27.171 --> 02:20:28.613]  An eighty seven dollar value.

[02:20:47.975 --> 02:20:53.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:56.143]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:20:56.964 --> 02:21:01.528]  Well, we had Judge Andrew Napolitano on with us today, then Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:09.617]  And now we have Dr. Rima Labo, M.D., and her husband together back in Panama.
[02:21:10.885 --> 02:21:14.828]  The one, the only, Major General Albert N. Stubblebine III, U.S.
[02:21:14.948 --> 02:21:15.968]  Army, retired.
[02:21:16.949 --> 02:21:18.590]  We went over his bio last week.
[02:21:18.610 --> 02:21:22.673]  You can find out more at healthfreedomusa.org.
[02:21:22.793 --> 02:21:27.156]  One word, healthfreedomusa.org.
[02:21:27.957 --> 02:21:31.599]  And we are honored to have them with us into the next hour for the balance of the show.
[02:21:32.079 --> 02:21:38.784]  Coming up at 20 after, I promise, we're going directly to your questions or comments for General Stubblebine or Dr. Lebo.
[02:21:39.184 --> 02:21:39.744]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:21:39.764 --> 02:21:41.225]  It's always a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:21:41.325 --> 02:21:41.805]  Great being back!
[02:22:02.119 --> 02:22:25.572]  You talked about Codex, and I want to remind you listeners that the Codex Alimentarius is a UN commission which is run and funded by WHO, not your friend, and the food and agricultural organization, FAO, another not person-friendly organization that we in the United States know much less about than we do WHO.
[02:22:26.933 --> 02:22:34.898]  I want to remind you that WHO is using a two-pronged genocidal tool.
[02:22:36.158 --> 02:22:45.844]  One prong is the degradation of the world's food supply and the mandating of undernutrition, which they admit
[02:22:46.477 --> 02:22:46.998]  We're good to go.
[02:23:07.597 --> 02:23:10.099]  Principal moneymakers are big pharma.
[02:23:10.479 --> 02:23:16.163]  And of course, we have to add vaccines in there as another principal moneymaker big time.
[02:23:16.644 --> 02:23:23.529]  But in addition to that, they are the principal killers in the developing, out of the developing world.
[02:23:23.569 --> 02:23:32.696]  So if you mandate undernutrition, and then sanctimoniously say, well, it's undernutrition that causes these diseases, isn't that too bad?
[02:23:33.016 --> 02:23:36.959]  You are definitely talking out of both sides of your genocidal mouth.
[02:23:37.379 --> 02:23:38.521]  You know, that's a good point.
[02:23:38.541 --> 02:23:40.303]  I didn't bring this up to you, Dr. Labo, last week.
[02:23:56.923 --> 02:24:00.086]  It actually came out in UN documents where they discussed in the 60s.
[02:24:00.346 --> 02:24:02.268]  In fact, we need to get that pulled back up.
[02:24:02.689 --> 02:24:09.315]  They discussed using vaccines as the delivery system of cancer and sterilization.
[02:24:09.375 --> 02:24:15.501]  So, I mean, as you said, they've been caught by high courts in India, the Philippines, in Africa.
[02:24:15.861 --> 02:24:17.563]  I mean, this is really starting to get out.
[02:24:18.786 --> 02:24:35.379]  That's right, and it's very important for your listeners and the people that your listeners talk to, and for the people who go to our website, healthfreedomusa.org, to understand that these sacred cow organizations, the U.S.
[02:24:35.439 --> 02:24:42.864]  government, WHO, the U.N., and the pharmaceutical industry, are held aloft by propaganda.
[02:24:43.084 --> 02:24:46.347]  When you investigate the facts, as you do, as we do, Alex,
[02:24:46.907 --> 02:24:53.974]  What you come up with is a horrifying, breathtaking, mind-numbing evil.
[02:24:54.975 --> 02:24:56.256]  It's that simple.
[02:24:56.637 --> 02:25:11.091]  Now, when I say that there are interlinked genocidal tools, you have to understand, of course, that the immune system is the common pathway for both of their weapons.
[02:25:11.713 --> 02:25:19.279]  The immune system is damaged and destroyed by their vaccine, as well as directly inducing sterility.
[02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:24.083]  And the immune system is damaged by their degraded food.
[02:25:24.524 --> 02:25:25.484]  Stay there, doctor.
[02:25:25.564 --> 02:25:26.405]  Back in one minute.
[02:25:28.827 --> 02:25:30.909]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:25:31.449 --> 02:25:34.592]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:25:37.825 --> 02:25:41.489]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:25:41.849 --> 02:25:44.852]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:25:45.072 --> 02:25:49.856]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:25:49.876 --> 02:25:56.142]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:25:56.282 --> 02:25:58.525]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:25:59.045 --> 02:25:59.325]  Tim Geithner?
[02:25:59.345 --> 02:25:59.765]  Bernanke?
[02:25:59.865 --> 02:26:00.626]  They're arsonists!
[02:26:00.666 --> 02:26:01.786]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:26:01.806 --> 02:26:04.048]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:26:17.955 --> 02:26:19.776]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:26:20.076 --> 02:26:24.900]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:35.166]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:26:39.589 --> 02:26:41.511]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:26:41.971 --> 02:26:44.753]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:26:58.697 --> 02:27:17.963]  We're talking about Endgame, a pharmacological, military-industrial complex, grid of control, a scientific dictatorship, a planetary dictatorship to carry out the orderly extermination of the majority of the world population.
[02:27:18.383 --> 02:27:23.005]  Now, from UN documents, I made this film three years ago, Endgame, documenting it all.
[02:27:23.825 --> 02:27:26.566]  Now we have the White House Science Czar's own book
[02:27:27.944 --> 02:27:30.866]  As if I wrote it, but from their perspective.
[02:27:30.966 --> 02:27:34.328]  Or as if General Stubblebine wrote it, but from their perspective.
[02:27:34.808 --> 02:27:37.150]  Confirming everything we've ever said.
[02:27:38.350 --> 02:27:45.615]  Because we can look at what they're doing and tell you what their operation is, but to have their signed, sealed confessions...
[02:27:46.843 --> 02:27:50.246]  And then to not see them arrested, to not see this stopping, it's incredible.
[02:27:50.727 --> 02:28:04.819]  Dr. Rima Labo, medical doctor, she's treated heads of state, her husband, they're partners in fighting crime, Major General Stubblebine, they're both here with us and we're going to go back to Dr. Labo here in a minute.
[02:28:04.839 --> 02:28:12.046]  They joined us via speakerphone because we can't get through the regular line in Central America right now, so we're on their backup line.
[02:28:14.219 --> 02:28:33.546]  Knowing about John P. Holdren's publications and the internal government documents that are now public, where the plan to carry out this extermination is just admitted, is it the weight of the system, its own inertia, that they don't get in trouble, or kind of like Hitler couldn't get in trouble until we finally removed him?
[02:28:33.846 --> 02:28:34.966]  I mean, where is this going?
[02:28:37.427 --> 02:28:39.048]  Well, I don't think so.
[02:28:39.188 --> 02:28:42.029]  I think that, you know, they are
[02:28:42.882 --> 02:28:52.148]  In some way, are of the opinion that they've got to publish what they're going to do so that it makes it all right when they actually do it.
[02:28:52.929 --> 02:29:06.978]  There's another piece, too, and that is, if you're going to have a program that's as complicated as this one, then you must have a manual by which you go by.
[02:29:07.398 --> 02:29:09.600]  You know that every item
[02:29:12.250 --> 02:29:13.211]  It's a military.
[02:29:13.511 --> 02:29:15.032]  It's got a manual somewhere.
[02:29:15.713 --> 02:29:17.574]  So they've written the manual for us.
[02:29:18.075 --> 02:29:19.796]  And I want to make another point, Alex.
[02:29:20.156 --> 02:29:22.098]  You said, why don't they get in trouble?
[02:29:22.138 --> 02:29:27.782]  Well, they control the system, so they don't get in trouble with indictments and things like that.
[02:29:28.182 --> 02:29:32.866]  But we, you and I and the other truth discussors,
[02:29:33.326 --> 02:29:34.267]  We're good to go.
[02:29:48.383 --> 02:29:48.703]  Thank you.
[02:30:07.538 --> 02:30:27.475]  It was a good idea when it was started in the 90s, but it has become, like everything else in the federal government, like the FDA, the Fraud and Death Administration, and the CDC, the Centers for Disease Creation, they have become the tools of the industries that they were designed to regulate.
[02:30:27.515 --> 02:30:36.162]  The same is true of the National Organic Standards Board, which now allows more than 10% GMO contamination
[02:30:36.622 --> 02:30:36.742]  Okay.
[02:30:36.762 --> 02:30:37.062]  Thank you.
[02:30:48.884 --> 02:31:03.970]  One thing that happened because of the huge public outcry today is that the National Organic Standards Board was forced to apply organic standards to body care products as well as food products.
[02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:18.016]  They named by name Amazon Organics, Avalon Organics, Desert Essence Organics, Giovanni Organic Cosmetics, Jason Pure Natural and Organic Cosmetics.
[02:31:18.556 --> 02:31:24.538]  Yeah, so they're taking over the certifiers of organics so they can mislabel them.
[02:31:24.558 --> 02:31:24.898]  Stay there.
[02:31:24.978 --> 02:31:26.799]  We've got to go to break.
[02:31:27.699 --> 02:31:30.260]  We're going to try a better phone line with you guys as well.
[02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:30.800]  Stay with us.
[02:31:46.536 --> 02:31:55.664]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[02:31:55.684 --> 02:31:58.827]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[02:31:59.047 --> 02:32:04.752]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[02:32:04.933 --> 02:32:09.417]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[02:32:09.697 --> 02:32:12.059]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[02:32:12.319 --> 02:32:21.410]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[02:32:21.530 --> 02:32:26.936]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[02:32:47.213 --> 02:32:49.834]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:50.235 --> 02:32:55.197]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:32:55.557 --> 02:32:57.298]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:57.599 --> 02:33:02.421]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:33:02.601 --> 02:33:03.582]  How much do you want?
[02:33:03.802 --> 02:33:04.542]  When do you want it?
[02:33:04.922 --> 02:33:06.523]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:33:06.803 --> 02:33:07.624]  When will you need it?
[02:33:07.884 --> 02:33:09.945]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:33:10.085 --> 02:33:11.186]  Will there be any food?
[02:33:11.426 --> 02:33:12.727]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:33:13.387 --> 02:33:15.328]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[02:33:15.468 --> 02:33:18.009]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:33:18.189 --> 02:33:21.391]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:33:21.791 --> 02:33:25.293]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:33:25.593 --> 02:33:26.593]  How much will you need?
[02:33:26.834 --> 02:33:27.454]  We don't know.
[02:33:27.734 --> 02:33:28.654]  How much do you want?
[02:33:28.835 --> 02:33:29.535]  All you can get.
[02:33:29.755 --> 02:33:30.615]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.856 --> 02:33:33.617]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:33:33.897 --> 02:33:35.658]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:33:35.678 --> 02:33:36.599]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:53.104]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:33:53.224 --> 02:33:54.465]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:33:54.505 --> 02:33:55.186]  It's very real.
[02:33:55.326 --> 02:33:59.088]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:33:59.208 --> 02:34:03.531]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:34:03.691 --> 02:34:06.052]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.

[02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:45.442]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:34:47.543 --> 02:34:53.085]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:35:03.815 --> 02:35:23.577]  Okay, we are trying different connections to get better audio with the General Stubblebine, Major General Stubblebine and Dr. Rima Lebo from their headquarters joining us from Health Freedom USA down in Panama and she's going over organics victories we've had.
[02:35:23.657 --> 02:35:24.578]  First we had a victory
[02:35:25.831 --> 02:35:25.931]  Yeah.
[02:35:43.763 --> 02:35:44.823]  And I'm simplifying this.
[02:35:44.843 --> 02:35:51.426]  There's a lot of different techniques they used, certifying things that were GMO, that were genetically modified as organic.
[02:35:51.706 --> 02:35:53.206]  But she's saying there's been a victory there.
[02:35:53.607 --> 02:35:56.528]  Then we'll get into the latest on flu and a lot more.
[02:35:56.568 --> 02:36:01.329]  But before we go there, I want to finish my question to General Stubblebine and to Dr. Labo.
[02:36:01.589 --> 02:36:09.592]  You're a medical doctor and a psychiatrist, Dr. Labo, and General Stubblebine's commanded hundreds of thousands of troops and generals and many others, and he understands psychology.
[02:36:09.872 --> 02:36:10.993]  And I loved your answer.
[02:36:11.653 --> 02:36:13.014]  To why they write these books.
[02:36:13.094 --> 02:36:14.155]  This is a manual.
[02:36:14.475 --> 02:36:21.680]  And we've bought over a hundred globalist manuals, high-level government manuals, for State Department people, UN people.
[02:36:22.021 --> 02:36:23.422]  They admit Carol Quigley's book.
[02:36:24.246 --> 02:36:34.809]  Was commissioned by the CFR and other organizations as a briefing manual for high-level CIA and State Department, not meant for public distribution.
[02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:45.492]  And they admit these are manuals, but that something else General Stubblevine said I wanted to comment on, and then Dr. Labo, with her psychiatry background, understanding this.
[02:36:46.213 --> 02:36:53.295]  Why do these people have a compulsion to tell you what they're going to do publicly, but
[02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:57.250]  You know, in a small way, they whisper under their breath.
[02:36:57.310 --> 02:37:03.132]  It's like the old tales of vampires and the fables having to trick you to invite them in.
[02:37:03.612 --> 02:37:08.494]  Why do they always tell you what they're going to do?
[02:37:09.955 --> 02:37:12.896]  Why first General Stubblebine and then Dr. Labo?
[02:37:15.417 --> 02:37:20.899]  It seems to me that it's almost, and I have no evidence of this other than
[02:37:22.544 --> 02:37:33.759]  Watching it over and over and over again, but it's almost like they have a manual that says in order to do what we're going to do to these people, we got to tell them what we're going to do before we do it.
[02:37:34.554 --> 02:37:38.336]  I mean, it's almost a ritual event.
[02:37:38.897 --> 02:37:43.039]  And after you've seen it the first time, say, oh, no.
[02:37:43.199 --> 02:37:44.600]  Second time, oh, no.
[02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:49.943]  But eventually, you get to a point where you say, holy smokes, these people are crazy.
[02:37:50.323 --> 02:37:54.486]  But they're telling us what they're going to do to us before they do it.
[02:37:54.886 --> 02:38:00.249]  And if we don't pay attention, then it's our fault that we're getting in trouble.
[02:38:00.709 --> 02:38:06.327]  That's when we've got to start the pushback before it becomes totally effective.
[02:38:08.706 --> 02:38:09.786]  I'm sorry, Alex, go ahead.
[02:38:10.106 --> 02:38:15.348]  No, I mean, go ahead and then we're going to get into Stop the Shot, The Organics, What's Happening with Codex Alimentarius.
[02:38:15.408 --> 02:38:16.388]  I mean, give us the latest.
[02:38:16.428 --> 02:38:19.369]  You were there because you guys are really pushing back.
[02:38:19.409 --> 02:38:21.770]  I mean, you are leaders actually taking action.
[02:38:21.810 --> 02:38:30.493]  But commenting on that question to General Stubblebine, as a psychiatrist, why are they obsessed with telling you what they're going to do?
[02:38:30.993 --> 02:38:35.114]  But then if you say, I don't want that, they say, oh, this book doesn't exist.
[02:38:36.255 --> 02:38:37.035]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:55.841]  Uh, does anybody remember Son of Sam, who was cutting newspapers apart and magazines and pasted together messages like, stop me before I kill, after he had killed and before he killed a lot more people?
[02:38:58.503 --> 02:39:05.670]  Uh, a need to be recognized that's very deep in the human psyche, no matter how evil and perverted the human psyche is.
[02:39:06.050 --> 02:39:20.363]  And so, criminals, uh, police, uh, detectives know perfectly well that criminals get caught because they leave clues saying, recognize me, recognize me, even though they may not consciously want to be caught.
[02:39:20.743 --> 02:39:46.914]  And in fact, I believe that this may be the last remnant of humanity in psychopaths so insane that they can, and I'm saying insane as a trained psychiatrist, so insane that they can comfortably and laughingly contemplate with great smugness the genocidal extermination of virtually
[02:39:47.874 --> 02:39:52.876]  Everybody who doesn't personally serve them or their cohort.
[02:39:53.136 --> 02:39:55.837]  This is fabulous craziness.
[02:39:56.297 --> 02:39:59.699]  Understand, there's nothing normal about it.
[02:39:59.839 --> 02:40:09.542]  And so I believe that the reason they have this rule, which it appears that they do have, is because it serves their last shred of humanity.
[02:40:09.882 --> 02:40:12.203]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[02:40:12.263 --> 02:40:14.084]  We all know at this point that a theory
[02:40:14.424 --> 02:40:17.125]  It's an untested hypothesis.
[02:40:17.625 --> 02:40:19.466]  We have the documentation.
[02:40:19.766 --> 02:40:23.228]  This is a conspiracy reality to kill.
[02:40:23.688 --> 02:40:43.096]  And I want to point out that what's happening and what's being shared on the internet is the revelation of what we predicted and what you predicted, Alex, which is that the swine flu vaccines are in themselves causing miscarriages and horrific neurological
[02:40:43.416 --> 02:40:56.020]  Okay, we're going to go over that right now and I'm going to sit back and give you both the floor to go over your lawsuit, victories we're having, but also the carnage being created by the vaccines that was predicted because of the medical evidence.
[02:40:56.461 --> 02:40:58.401]  But I want to go back to the nature of our enemy.
[02:40:58.881 --> 02:41:05.344]  I think there's one more reason that in white papers that they publish, they admit their entire plan
[02:41:06.064 --> 02:41:09.046]  And then disdainfully tell the general public none of it exists.
[02:41:09.486 --> 02:41:29.878]  While Ban Ki-moon admits world government, carbon tax to enslave us, and then other publications owned by George Soros say it doesn't exist, while he goes on Laird NewsHour and calls for world government and carbon tax to fund it, his publications, all six of them, attack Alex Jones and say I'm crazy, none of it exists.
[02:41:30.558 --> 02:41:35.242]  I will explain why this is happening, and I want General Stubblebine and then you, Dr. Labo, to comment on this.
[02:41:35.502 --> 02:41:37.304]  Then we'll go over your evidence and then take calls.
[02:41:37.784 --> 02:41:41.728]  But, they're also doing this to multiple audiences.
[02:41:42.128 --> 02:41:51.957]  To the dumbed down, easily suggestible, cowardly people who want to buy a lie, who want to lay down, who want to be slaves, they just don't want to hear about it.
[02:41:52.757 --> 02:41:54.179]  It's, none of this exists.
[02:41:54.679 --> 02:42:02.967]  But then to those of us that they know are not wicked and do have empathy and are tuned into our center and do love people and love creation, it's a threat.
[02:42:03.388 --> 02:42:06.971]  Yeah, we're going to kill you and there's nothing these dumb slaves are going to do.
[02:42:07.011 --> 02:42:08.213]  They're never going to wake up.
[02:42:08.493 --> 02:42:10.114]  So really it's a bravado.
[02:42:10.194 --> 02:42:15.460]  It's an arrogant, you know, the devil roars to see who he may devour and to intimidate.
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:18.643]  So it's also blowing their trumpet saying, look,
[02:42:18.883 --> 02:42:20.705]  We'll tell the world we're gonna kill you!
[02:42:20.945 --> 02:42:21.986]  And look at these slaves!
[02:42:22.226 --> 02:42:23.467]  They won't even listen to you!
[02:42:23.627 --> 02:42:24.628]  I've had elitists tell me that.
[02:42:24.648 --> 02:42:27.731]  They go, Alex, you notice you lay all this out and the slaves don't care.
[02:42:27.991 --> 02:42:29.792]  They want to be slaves.
[02:42:30.053 --> 02:42:34.056]  So it's also a type of not just bragging, as you said, but a type of intimidation.
[02:42:34.096 --> 02:42:34.837]  General Stubblebine.
[02:42:36.261 --> 02:42:39.162]  Incidentally, I totally agree with you, Alex.
[02:42:40.702 --> 02:42:43.942]  There are a group of us that need to be intimidated.
[02:42:44.022 --> 02:42:49.843]  There's a group of us that are sound asleep, that won't even pay any attention.
[02:42:50.343 --> 02:42:57.605]  But those who are pushing back need... We just lost their line.
[02:42:57.945 --> 02:43:00.085]  Those of us pushing back need to be intimidated.
[02:43:00.105 --> 02:43:04.666]  And we've got them on another backup line.
[02:43:04.686 --> 02:43:05.226]  Flip them over.
[02:43:07.392 --> 02:43:08.714]  I don't think this is a conspiracy.
[02:43:08.734 --> 02:43:09.915]  I think it's because they're in Panama.
[02:43:11.297 --> 02:43:17.125]  I don't know where it is, but it sure is frustrating.
[02:43:17.545 --> 02:43:18.526]  Well, you know what?
[02:43:18.787 --> 02:43:20.509]  With Ventura, they may have been cutting him off.
[02:43:20.529 --> 02:43:23.853]  Okay, you were saying there's a group of us who needs to be intimidated.
[02:43:23.893 --> 02:43:24.174]  Go ahead.
[02:43:25.014 --> 02:43:29.195]  That needs to be intimidated and needs to be controlled.
[02:43:29.815 --> 02:43:40.177]  And so if we publish all of this and we tell them, they can say, oh, well, you better pay attention, young man.
[02:43:40.617 --> 02:43:43.898]  If you don't, you're going to be blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:43:44.358 --> 02:43:53.180]  So I believe that there is a pounding of chest, a patting themselves on the back and
[02:43:54.081 --> 02:43:59.273]  Letting us know what is coming down the pike is not going to be good for us.
[02:43:59.774 --> 02:44:03.482]  You better shut up, sit down, and just take it.
[02:44:04.104 --> 02:44:08.428]  Well, you know Alex, what you were saying and what I was saying are the same thing.
[02:44:09.428 --> 02:44:31.087]  This kind of arrogant hilarity, feverish hilarity you might say, in these pronouncements and then the denials, is very much both an aggressive demonstration of their power and at the same time you can see it as this need to be recognized and an intimidation, but then again,
[02:44:31.867 --> 02:44:36.769]  Our behavior as human beings is usually motivated by many things at the same time.
[02:44:36.809 --> 02:44:38.150]  So this makes perfect sense.
[02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:39.871]  It's not unitary.
[02:44:39.911 --> 02:44:42.752]  It's several things moving us in the same direction.
[02:44:42.792 --> 02:44:52.597]  Whatever it is, thank goodness that they feel the need to reveal their plans first, so those of us who are awake and trumpeting can let people know what's going on.
[02:44:53.097 --> 02:44:55.018]  And while we have the internet,
[02:44:55.876 --> 02:45:00.517]  We have the power to awaken and people have the power to make change.
[02:45:00.838 --> 02:45:01.958]  We have a lawsuit.
[02:45:02.218 --> 02:45:12.461]  The Natural Solutions Foundation has a lawsuit that had a hearing on Thursday, November 5th, which was after we spoke from the Codex meeting.
[02:45:12.781 --> 02:45:15.462]  And right now, I'm sending out an urgent alert.
[02:45:15.882 --> 02:45:28.149]  Through your show, Alex, for plaintiffs, people who are willing to make a complaint to stop the compulsory or deadly vaccines, even if they're voluntary, they're still deadly.
[02:45:28.489 --> 02:45:30.610]  They're still causing miscarriages.
[02:45:30.650 --> 02:45:37.674]  They're still causing things to happen, such as happened to Desiree Jennings, the cheerleader in training.
[02:45:38.774 --> 02:45:40.996]  We need parents in New Jersey.
[02:45:41.795 --> 02:45:51.002]  With children five years of age or young who are willing to say electronically, I don't want my child vaccinated.
[02:45:51.483 --> 02:45:54.585]  And this will cost no money for the parents.
[02:45:54.665 --> 02:45:57.147]  They will not have to travel to Washington, D.C.
[02:45:57.187 --> 02:45:58.148]  to the federal court.
[02:45:59.089 --> 02:46:05.254]  They will prepare a certification and sign it that represents their situation.
[02:46:06.034 --> 02:46:16.215]  If you are willing, or if you are the custodial grandparent or parent, and you are willing to participate in this Stop the...
[02:46:18.413 --> 02:46:19.774]  Okay, we lost their line again.
[02:46:19.794 --> 02:46:21.155]  We're going to come back to them after break.
[02:46:21.635 --> 02:46:22.556]  They've got a program.
[02:46:22.596 --> 02:46:23.696]  They've filed suit.
[02:46:24.156 --> 02:46:27.679]  They need a class action to block the inoculation.
[02:46:27.699 --> 02:46:28.579]  And it is forced.
[02:46:28.699 --> 02:46:30.901]  They are injecting children all over the country.
[02:46:31.661 --> 02:46:34.343]  When the parents find out, they say, oops, we made a mistake.
[02:46:35.023 --> 02:46:37.384]  They're telling medical workers they're going to be fired.
[02:46:38.025 --> 02:46:41.507]  But then Obama plays the good cop and says, we're not making you take the shots.
[02:46:41.527 --> 02:46:44.249]  We'll be right back.
[02:46:44.269 --> 02:46:44.689]  Stay with us.
[02:46:47.202 --> 02:46:49.825]  What's so crazy about not starving?
[02:46:50.206 --> 02:46:57.134]  To cover yourself and your family in the event of accidents or emergency, you may have home, life, auto, dental, and health insurance.
[02:46:57.174 --> 02:46:58.816]  But what about food insurance?
[02:46:58.876 --> 02:47:01.179]  Water and food are vital to human survival.
[02:47:01.219 --> 02:47:03.762]  So what's so crazy about not starving?
[02:47:03.942 --> 02:47:10.247]  Foodinsurance.com has designed emergency packs and kits with at least two weeks worth of great tasting food and clean water.

[02:47:48.377 --> 02:47:52.020]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:47:52.380 --> 02:47:55.403]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:47:55.643 --> 02:47:57.044]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:47:57.751 --> 02:48:00.412]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:48:00.432 --> 02:48:06.653]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:48:06.813 --> 02:48:11.834]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:48:11.994 --> 02:48:21.976]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:48:22.096 --> 02:48:24.217]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:48:24.437 --> 02:48:25.758]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:48:26.038 --> 02:48:28.299]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:48:28.499 --> 02:48:30.340]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:35.422]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:48:35.782 --> 02:48:40.544]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:48:46.926 --> 02:48:52.807]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[02:48:53.247 --> 02:48:57.908]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[02:48:58.189 --> 02:49:02.009]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[02:49:02.269 --> 02:49:03.450]  Let's put this another way.
[02:49:03.610 --> 02:49:08.731]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[02:49:08.971 --> 02:49:11.591]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[02:49:11.871 --> 02:49:14.232]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[02:49:14.512 --> 02:49:15.952]  You can possess it in your hand.
[02:49:16.252 --> 02:49:17.192]  You can take it with you.
[02:49:17.512 --> 02:49:18.573]  Gold is real money.
[02:49:18.973 --> 02:49:20.073]  Gold is honest money.
[02:49:20.333 --> 02:49:22.573]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.

[02:49:38.556 --> 02:49:39.316]  We're good to go.
[02:50:03.524 --> 02:50:08.068]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?

[02:50:56.175 --> 02:51:01.579]  We don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm
[02:51:09.619 --> 02:51:16.505]  Joining us from Panama, General Albert N. Stubblebine III, Dr. Rima E. Lebo, their husband and wife.
[02:51:17.185 --> 02:51:19.707]  They travel all over the world fighting the globalist agenda.
[02:51:19.747 --> 02:51:22.589]  They have done so much great work and I wanted to have a backup this week.
[02:51:22.609 --> 02:51:30.396]  We're going to take some of your phone calls coming up the next segment specifically for them on the vaccines, Codex Alimentarius, the New World Order.
[02:51:30.856 --> 02:51:34.759]  Whatever you do, just please address your questions to them or make your quick point.
[02:51:34.779 --> 02:51:35.240]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:51:35.420 --> 02:51:49.131]  Okay, you got cut off again as we went to break, as you were trying to bring up the No Shots program, and you're calling for plaintiffs, specifically people... Who needs to call you?
[02:51:50.311 --> 02:52:02.476]  In New Jersey with kids five years and younger because the mandate is very strong that they must be vaccinated with the flu vaccines recommended by the CDC.
[02:52:02.796 --> 02:52:15.661]  And the judge, here's the point, when we went to the hearing on November 5th, the judge said, your case has New York plaintiffs and the New York mandate for health care workers has been called off.
[02:52:16.221 --> 02:52:17.602]  Therefore, he said, I want
[02:52:17.722 --> 02:52:19.024]  I want you to come back in.
[02:52:19.184 --> 02:52:20.986]  I want this case in my court.
[02:52:21.387 --> 02:52:28.956]  But I want you to come back with New Jersey plaintiffs who have children five years of age and younger.
[02:52:28.996 --> 02:52:29.897]  I want to stop you.
[02:52:29.917 --> 02:52:30.638]  I want to stop you.
[02:52:30.678 --> 02:52:31.379]  This is huge.
[02:52:32.136 --> 02:52:35.178]  You and Burt are taking incredible action.
[02:52:35.198 --> 02:52:36.579]  You're going into the belly of the beast.
[02:52:36.599 --> 02:52:42.203]  You file suit and the New York judge says, yeah, they're pushing it, but they're not forcing it now.
[02:52:42.703 --> 02:52:43.944]  Thanks to previous suits.
[02:52:44.404 --> 02:52:46.245]  Bring me New Jersey plaintiffs.
[02:52:47.046 --> 02:52:53.510]  And so in federal court, you need New Jersey plaintiffs, people who've been pressured in public schools.
[02:52:53.991 --> 02:52:56.032]  I know we have listeners in New Jersey.
[02:52:56.372 --> 02:53:01.816]  They need to go to healthfreedomusa.org and you can have them given the paperwork.
[02:53:02.376 --> 02:53:09.138]  It's very easy because they're trying to set the precedent in New Jersey for future staged events.
[02:53:10.079 --> 02:53:12.159]  People want to have a victory against the globalists.
[02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:13.160]  This is it.
[02:53:13.180 --> 02:53:16.261]  I mean, in general, you guys are really taking action here.
[02:53:17.717 --> 02:53:28.660]  Well, we're trying to, Alex, and right at the moment we need the help of these New Jersey residents to be plaintiffs in the case.
[02:53:28.700 --> 02:53:31.341]  So we need, again, voices.
[02:53:31.621 --> 02:53:42.804]  This is a federal case, Alex, so that if the judge rules in our favor and gives an injunction, it will keep the FDA from releasing any of their deadly vaccines.
[02:53:43.304 --> 02:53:44.484]  Let me give you an email.
[02:53:44.724 --> 02:53:47.526]  And this will set a huge precedent, too.
[02:53:49.287 --> 02:53:54.730]  It absolutely can stop the vaccine juggernaut in its tracks.
[02:53:54.831 --> 02:54:06.898]  And let me tell you, when the United States cannot proceed with its vaccine program, every other country in the world will come to a grinding, screeching halt.
[02:54:07.419 --> 02:54:10.801]  So this is a federal case, but it has global implications.
[02:54:11.221 --> 02:54:13.282]  Now, let me give you an email.
[02:54:14.484 --> 02:54:16.432]  If you want to be a New Jersey plaintiff,
[02:54:17.660 --> 02:54:45.904]  Email us at Ralph, R-A-L-P-H, dot Fusatola, F-U-C-E-T-O-L-A, at USA.net, Ralph.Fusatola, at USA.net, or go to our website, HealthFreedomUSA.org, and scroll down to the lower right-hand side, and there you will see an entry on Stop the Shot.
[02:54:46.317 --> 02:54:47.277]  Contact us.
[02:54:47.718 --> 02:54:53.901]  This will not cost you money, but it could save you and your family your lives.
[02:54:54.661 --> 02:54:55.041]  All of us.
[02:54:55.061 --> 02:54:57.482]  So the plaintiff and resistance is victory.
[02:54:57.782 --> 02:54:59.703]  People always talk about, well, we need to do something.
[02:55:00.124 --> 02:55:01.464]  All we talk about is solutions.
[02:55:01.504 --> 02:55:02.865]  This is a smart solution.
[02:55:03.505 --> 02:55:05.786]  Even if you guys don't succeed, at least you fought.
[02:55:06.066 --> 02:55:07.626]  But you're saying you have a judge.
[02:55:07.686 --> 02:55:11.427]  It's clearly constitutional that they can't force you to take vaccines.
[02:55:11.747 --> 02:55:14.928]  New Jersey's saying they're going to arrest you if you don't give your kids the shots.
[02:55:15.328 --> 02:55:21.990]  So anybody being threatened with this mandate, anybody who's got children in New Jersey can be a plaintiff, correct?
[02:55:22.827 --> 02:55:23.247]  Correct.
[02:55:23.527 --> 02:55:25.588]  The child has to be 5 or under.
[02:55:25.928 --> 02:55:29.668]  Now it's very important to understand this will not cost you money.
[02:55:29.928 --> 02:55:31.389]  This will not endanger you.
[02:55:31.809 --> 02:55:35.969]  This will allow you to participate and the more the merrier.
[02:55:35.989 --> 02:55:48.372]  It will allow you to participate in stopping the vaccines from being even recommended because they are illegal, they are untrusted, they are unsafe.
[02:55:49.973 --> 02:55:57.458]  And if people would have done this with Rick Perry, taking that deadly Gardasil shot and forcing it on people, there wouldn't have been all those deaths.
[02:55:57.498 --> 02:56:04.262]  We just lay here and go, Rick Perry's our God, he says we gotta take it, we do, we roll over and let him hit us.
[02:56:05.523 --> 02:56:13.969]  And I want to know how many of the girls and women who have taken that God-awful Gardasil and now the new one, Servivax,
[02:56:18.328 --> 02:56:20.429]  This is kind of dramatic how we keep losing them.
[02:56:20.449 --> 02:56:22.010]  Can we flip over to the other line?
[02:56:22.630 --> 02:56:23.710]  Every time we got a break?
[02:56:24.871 --> 02:56:27.772]  Hannah Montana says all the girls need their shots.
[02:56:28.152 --> 02:56:32.914]  Hannah Montana says that we need a global carbon tax.
[02:56:33.194 --> 02:56:37.196]  And Hannah Montana says we need to get rid of free speech with the cybersecurity.
[02:56:37.216 --> 02:56:37.956]  We're on the march.
[02:56:38.457 --> 02:56:40.057]  The empire's on the run.
[02:56:40.998 --> 02:56:43.679]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:56:46.368 --> 02:56:51.555]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:56:51.675 --> 02:56:56.041]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:56:56.221 --> 02:56:58.064]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:56:58.484 --> 02:56:59.846]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:57:00.106 --> 02:57:01.148]  There is a solution.
[02:57:01.368 --> 02:57:09.394]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:57:09.794 --> 02:57:16.859]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:57:17.259 --> 02:57:22.863]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:57:23.303 --> 02:57:28.887]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:57:29.287 --> 02:57:33.112]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:57:46.311 --> 02:57:55.413]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[02:57:55.453 --> 02:57:58.594]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[02:57:58.814 --> 02:58:04.515]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[02:58:04.695 --> 02:58:09.176]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[02:58:09.456 --> 02:58:11.817]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[02:58:12.097 --> 02:58:21.186]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[02:58:21.286 --> 02:58:26.712]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[02:58:43.344 --> 02:58:43.804]  Do it now.
[02:58:49.710 --> 02:58:52.652]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[02:58:52.932 --> 02:58:55.874]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[02:58:56.114 --> 02:58:58.736]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[02:58:59.076 --> 02:59:04.940]  If another Great Depression strikes America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[02:59:05.447 --> 02:59:08.529]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[02:59:08.969 --> 02:59:15.214]  Patriotfood.com is different, because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[02:59:15.494 --> 02:59:22.379]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty, food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[02:59:22.399 --> 02:59:25.321]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds
[02:59:29.085 --> 02:59:29.766]  I think so.
[02:59:49.892 --> 02:59:51.994]  Alright, we're going to take some phone calls for our guests.
[02:59:52.295 --> 02:59:58.261]  I meant to get them up for a full hour and a half and take calls, but we had problems connecting with Central America today.
[02:59:58.802 --> 03:00:01.044]  As you've heard, they got on about 20 minutes late.
[03:00:01.064 --> 03:00:04.968]  We'll have them on in a month or so again, because they have such a wealth of knowledge.
[03:00:06.179 --> 03:00:21.377]  And phone call-wise, Jay, Jeremiah, Paul, Brendan, Holly, and others, we're going to get to your calls coming up here in about 10 minutes, but I want them to be able to finish up with their initiative to fight the vaccines and the reports coming in of it sterilizing, miscarriages, deaths, convulsions.
[03:00:21.837 --> 03:00:22.818]  That's now confirmed.
[03:00:23.789 --> 03:00:30.293]  And then Desiree, the young lady who was becoming a cheerleader.
[03:00:30.313 --> 03:00:31.534]  She was a backup cheerleader for him.
[03:00:32.195 --> 03:00:38.559]  She reportedly has gotten better now, so they're not letting folks know about some of the treatments for Guillain-Barré-type neurological disorders.
[03:00:39.279 --> 03:00:46.924]  Dale Dudley, local talk show host, number one talk show host in the morning, 93.7, KLBJ, the FM sister station of our AM affiliate.
[03:00:47.345 --> 03:00:48.706]  I've known him for over a decade.
[03:00:49.186 --> 03:00:53.469]  He got partially paralyzed after a vaccine a few months later.
[03:00:54.309 --> 03:00:59.373]  And they went to the doctors and they did tests and said Gilliam-Barre probably from the vaccine, but he got better.
[03:00:59.914 --> 03:01:01.675]  A lot of times you do get better, thank God.
[03:01:02.236 --> 03:01:05.638]  So we'll, uh, that's all over the news that's happening, but I know people.
[03:01:06.319 --> 03:01:08.040]  That was a regular seasonal flu shots.
[03:01:08.060 --> 03:01:09.321]  We're going to talk to them in just a moment.
[03:01:10.082 --> 03:01:11.883]  I haven't thanked any sponsors today.
[03:01:12.364 --> 03:01:15.826]  Number one is the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[03:01:16.787 --> 03:01:23.909]  That is how we fund so much of what we're doing here, is you purchasing t-shirts, books, videos, materials.
[03:01:24.249 --> 03:01:26.029]  We have a big nut to crack every month.
[03:01:26.550 --> 03:01:32.551]  And the videos, the books, the t-shirts, the ball caps, the materials, the wristbands, it's all about spreading the word.
[03:01:32.951 --> 03:01:34.392]  It's all about fighting the globalists.
[03:01:34.432 --> 03:01:35.852]  It's all about having an awakening.
[03:01:36.632 --> 03:01:37.772]  And you also support us.
[03:01:37.812 --> 03:01:43.054]  So please, especially with the holiday season, with Christmas here, give them an end of
[03:01:44.662 --> 03:01:53.007]  In the Fed t-shirt, give them a Fall of the Republic video, or a FEMA, Camp FEMA video, or Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:01:53.588 --> 03:01:56.629]  You know, this is a big platform where we support everybody else.
[03:01:56.649 --> 03:01:58.050]  Well, we need your support as well.
[03:01:58.270 --> 03:01:59.591]  Plus, you get great books and videos.
[03:01:59.911 --> 03:02:02.273]  So, InfoWars.com to order, or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[03:02:02.373 --> 03:02:04.714]  And support folks like our guest at HealthFreedomUSA.org.
[03:02:04.734 --> 03:02:05.015]  Support them!
[03:02:14.500 --> 03:02:15.461]  We're not the government.
[03:02:15.521 --> 03:02:18.543]  We don't come and take your tax money and then use it against you.
[03:02:19.043 --> 03:02:21.405]  We're here putting the truth out, asking for your support.
[03:02:21.805 --> 03:02:27.169]  And then we have our other sponsors that also fund us, that I really believe in, like survivalseedbank.com.
[03:02:27.489 --> 03:02:34.734]  In a real crisis, having a non-hybrid seed bank means having the ability to grow endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[03:02:42.281 --> 03:02:50.204]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds have the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[03:02:51.085 --> 03:02:56.927]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds, waged by the global elite, who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[03:02:58.322 --> 03:03:04.286]  By the way, they got Woody Harrelson running around with these YouTube videos to hype 2012, where he goes, man, it's a conspiracy.
[03:03:04.306 --> 03:03:05.407]  They got a Seed Vault.
[03:03:05.807 --> 03:03:07.088]  That's an AP in Reuters.
[03:03:07.488 --> 03:03:11.791]  But see, by making a joke out of it, now when you tell people about that, you get laughed at.
[03:03:12.192 --> 03:03:13.553]  This movie's coming out in two days.
[03:03:13.913 --> 03:03:17.195]  It's an AP, Reuters, that Google UN Seed Vault.
[03:03:17.495 --> 03:03:18.856]  It's got armed guards guarding it.
[03:03:21.243 --> 03:03:22.504]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:03:22.544 --> 03:03:26.447]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:03:26.487 --> 03:03:29.409]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:03:29.769 --> 03:03:31.110]  Okay, going back to our guests.
[03:03:31.210 --> 03:03:33.312]  Quickly, guys, and I really appreciate you joining us.
[03:03:33.632 --> 03:03:36.414]  I want to get to some calls to hear their wildcard questions.
[03:03:36.914 --> 03:03:37.374]  Ralph R-A-L-P-H
[03:03:59.608 --> 03:04:00.929]  We're good to go.
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:23.382]  In the United States and therefore in the rest of the world.
[03:04:23.782 --> 03:04:24.442]  It's close.
[03:04:24.622 --> 03:04:25.283]  It's at hand.
[03:04:25.603 --> 03:04:27.484]  The judge wants this case.
[03:04:27.864 --> 03:04:29.184]  The judge was listening.
[03:04:29.264 --> 03:04:31.746]  He wants the case as strong as possible.
[03:04:32.086 --> 03:04:34.087]  That's why he asked us to resubmit.
[03:04:34.487 --> 03:04:35.967]  What an opportunity!
[03:04:36.228 --> 03:04:40.309]  Now, if you also want to support us to help us defray the cost, great!
[03:04:40.910 --> 03:04:42.891]  On our website healthfreedomusa.org
[03:04:44.211 --> 03:04:47.793]  There's a link that says donate, do it.
[03:04:48.093 --> 03:04:53.616]  But the point is, we need the plaintiffs and we can stop the shot.
[03:04:53.796 --> 03:05:00.739]  Imagine what a tool the genocidalists will have lost if we take vaccines away from them.
[03:05:01.259 --> 03:05:01.980]  Imagine.
[03:05:04.021 --> 03:05:04.741]  Absolutely.
[03:05:05.201 --> 03:05:05.801]  General?
[03:05:06.342 --> 03:05:07.402]  Principle of war.
[03:05:07.882 --> 03:05:08.383]  Mass.
[03:05:09.203 --> 03:05:10.824]  That means we need
[03:05:15.154 --> 03:05:17.537]  That means we need to be able to stay connected with these folks.
[03:05:19.860 --> 03:05:23.044]  It's kind of fun, though, wondering how long they're going to stay up each time.
[03:05:25.247 --> 03:05:25.708]  We're here.
[03:05:25.728 --> 03:05:27.330]  Okay, you sound great now.
[03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:29.693]  Principal of War, Mass General.
[03:05:29.753 --> 03:05:30.113]  Go ahead.
[03:05:30.916 --> 03:05:31.396]  You've got it.
[03:05:31.556 --> 03:05:36.679]  Mass means we put the mass of our force on the enemy's weakness.
[03:05:37.119 --> 03:05:39.460]  Right now, New Jersey is the weakness.
[03:05:39.880 --> 03:05:44.902]  We need all of the voices we can get to put our mass on their weakness.
[03:05:45.663 --> 03:05:46.663]  Principle of war.
[03:05:47.123 --> 03:05:48.324]  That's the way you win.
[03:05:49.484 --> 03:05:51.185]  General, what's the principle of war?
[03:05:51.205 --> 03:05:53.326]  Just getting angry and deciding you're going to fight.
[03:05:53.566 --> 03:05:55.147]  That's the will to fight, isn't it?
[03:05:55.367 --> 03:05:59.529]  Don't we need to get the initiative, the will to fight back and grow up?
[03:06:00.498 --> 03:06:01.740]  It's called the offense.
[03:06:02.220 --> 03:06:04.484]  It is a principle of war.
[03:06:04.544 --> 03:06:05.485]  It's called the offense.
[03:06:05.525 --> 03:06:07.468]  You cannot win on the defense.
[03:06:08.029 --> 03:06:12.455]  So in order to do anything, you've got to go on the offense.
[03:06:12.515 --> 03:06:14.197]  And that's exactly what we're doing.
[03:06:14.357 --> 03:06:17.602]  Oh, by the way, the doctor who helped
[03:06:18.904 --> 03:06:35.946]  So tremendously who is a colleague of mine whom I've known for many years, Dr. Rashid Buttar, did the ordinary things that doctors like Buttar and myself do when we have patients who are in trouble that the ordinary kind of allopathic medicine has
[03:06:36.686 --> 03:06:40.549]  And yet, we are the doctors who are under assault.
[03:06:40.609 --> 03:06:49.394]  Dr. Buttar has been seriously molested by the state of North Carolina, as have most of my colleagues.
[03:06:49.434 --> 03:06:50.815]  Let me stop you.
[03:06:50.855 --> 03:06:56.359]  I mean, to be clear, you're saying the doctor, because she was highly publicized, he was able to contact her.
[03:06:56.379 --> 03:07:05.505]  You're saying the doctor who helped this lady stop the bad vaccine reaction, who was getting paralyzed, you're saying he's in trouble?
[03:07:07.518 --> 03:07:20.050]  We are all, those of us who are chelating physicians, some of us go to jail, some of us lose our licenses for using our medical judgment when it's not pharmaceutical, when it's not death dealing.
[03:07:20.731 --> 03:07:27.718]  Helping a patient curing cancer, for instance, if you're not an oncologist, and of course oncologists never cure cancer,
[03:07:28.058 --> 03:07:36.387]  Curing cancer is the surest way to lose your license if you acknowledge that you've... Well, there have been oncologists who've cured cancer who lose their license.
[03:07:36.407 --> 03:07:37.809]  They put undercover people in.
[03:07:38.429 --> 03:07:38.850]  Everything.
[03:07:38.890 --> 03:07:48.781]  Because if people start curing cancer and the word gets out, then the establishment's huge profit center of genocide is over.
[03:07:50.106 --> 03:07:59.077]  The cancer is the single most profitable medical activity disease that humankind has ever encountered.
[03:07:59.858 --> 03:08:06.246]  Dr. Leonard Caldwell, a dear friend and colleague of mine, and it would be lovely to have him on the show, Alex.
[03:08:07.007 --> 03:08:08.048]  He has a new book out.
[03:08:08.468 --> 03:08:10.530]  called the only answer to cancer.
[03:08:10.570 --> 03:08:13.754]  He says that all cancer is curable in two weeks.
[03:08:14.274 --> 03:08:22.903]  Dr. Caldwell had six cancer hospitals in Germany that were shut down by the German government because he was so successful.
[03:08:22.963 --> 03:08:24.324]  He migrated to the U.S.
[03:08:24.625 --> 03:08:25.466]  and voila!
[03:08:25.866 --> 03:08:27.528]  Same story.
[03:08:27.848 --> 03:08:30.190]  This is in fact a cabal.
[03:08:30.971 --> 03:08:38.074]  And we need to speak out and we need to make our choices and put our effort where our truth is.
[03:08:39.675 --> 03:08:40.235]  Absolutely.
[03:08:40.275 --> 03:08:42.996]  Well, we know they're suppressing life extension technologies.
[03:08:43.476 --> 03:08:52.480]  That's why they want to bring in the world government, not just to kill us, but they say they need to get rid of us because they can't give life extension to 7 billion people.
[03:08:53.320 --> 03:08:55.882]  And that's the real reason they want to kill everybody.
[03:08:56.222 --> 03:08:57.642]  Not that there aren't enough resources.
[03:08:58.843 --> 03:08:59.223]  Correct.
[03:09:00.066 --> 03:09:05.870]  Because there won't be enough resources with the current technology if 7 billion people start living to be 150.
[03:09:06.010 --> 03:09:28.625]  I want to go to some phone calls here, and I want to have you guys back soon because there's so much to cover, but Doctor, when you were doing your residency, you made the point, and then when you were teaching as a doctor, and I've talked to many other medical doctors here on air, they said 20, 30, 40 years ago, seeing a child with cancer in the ward was like, come see this leprechaun, come see this
[03:09:30.546 --> 03:09:33.169]  Unicorn, come see this mermaid.
[03:09:33.229 --> 03:09:34.430]  I mean, it didn't exist.
[03:09:34.510 --> 03:09:35.671]  It was fabled.
[03:09:36.111 --> 03:09:41.836]  Now, I know 20-year-olds, 25-year-olds, 30-year-olds, 2-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 9-year-olds.
[03:09:42.236 --> 03:09:44.358]  I mean, it seems like everybody's got cancer.
[03:09:44.398 --> 03:09:45.719]  Everybody's dying from it.
[03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:51.044]  And they just make it into a big pageant of, yeah, everybody's got cancer now.
[03:09:51.444 --> 03:09:52.765]  We're all come together.
[03:09:53.246 --> 03:09:54.306]  Isn't it beautiful?
[03:09:54.667 --> 03:09:57.409]  Without asking why everybody's getting cancer.
[03:09:57.910 --> 03:09:58.190]  Doctor?
[03:09:59.895 --> 03:10:15.659]  When I was in medical school, and I did graduate within living memory, it was in 1970 as a matter of fact, when a child had cancer, other than a Wilms tumor of the kidney, all of us were brought in to gawk at the child, that was considered to be medical education.
[03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:20.981]  And it didn't do much for the child, it really didn't teach us anything, but that's how unusual
[03:10:21.941 --> 03:10:22.042]  Yes.
[03:10:35.060 --> 03:10:49.444]  Any child who reaches the age of 18, or whose birthday is 18 years at that point, will have either died from cancer or survived cancer in 50% of the cases.
[03:10:49.804 --> 03:10:53.845]  That means one child in two is expected to get cancer.
[03:10:54.505 --> 03:11:01.427]  The ordinary immune system of a child is robust and vigorous, and children are very good at healing themselves.
[03:11:01.867 --> 03:11:09.890]  If they're healthy and haven't been vaccinated and are eating decent food, and they're in loving environments, they have wonderful immune systems.
[03:11:10.190 --> 03:11:11.111]  But no more.
[03:11:11.531 --> 03:11:12.071]  No more.
[03:11:12.431 --> 03:11:13.672]  Codex is helping that.
[03:11:13.932 --> 03:11:15.652]  The vaccines and allopathic medicine.
[03:11:15.672 --> 03:11:22.215]  Because they've taken the vitamins out of the food, they're drinking corn syrup filled with mercury all day, which they add, for some reason, to brain damages.
[03:11:22.475 --> 03:11:25.136]  They've been given all these shots to burn out their immune system.
[03:11:25.856 --> 03:11:29.238]  And the police and military and government people, they'll just say,
[03:11:29.938 --> 03:11:31.721]  You now die at 15 of cancer.
[03:11:31.741 --> 03:11:36.307]  You know, this is just how America is, and if you don't like it, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:11:36.647 --> 03:11:45.880]  General, how long can they carry this Holocaust out until their own enforcers realize they're working for eugenicist, psychopathic killers?
[03:11:47.352 --> 03:11:52.136]  Well, as long as we keep the voices going and we keep doing pushback.
[03:11:53.077 --> 03:11:55.979]  And incidentally, we've got to do that.
[03:11:56.639 --> 03:11:59.322]  If we don't do that, then they win.
[03:11:59.582 --> 03:12:06.227]  So we need to continually find the weaknesses, find the place.
[03:12:06.807 --> 03:12:09.229]  And I... How long?
[03:12:12.242 --> 03:12:20.988]  I think if we keep pushing back, they lose, and I think we can do it in, what, six months?
[03:12:21.388 --> 03:12:22.549]  Alex, they're teetering.
[03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:26.431]  This whole vaccine thing has them reeling.
[03:12:27.112 --> 03:12:29.493]  They are not in the position that they thought they'd be in.
[03:12:29.533 --> 03:12:35.397]  They thought that they would have Codex sewn up and globally implemented by December 31st, 2009.
[03:12:35.838 --> 03:12:39.200]  Yet, at the Codex meeting, they were planning for Codex
[03:12:41.362 --> 03:12:44.104]  ...forward movement with various strategies in 2011, 2013, 2015.
[03:12:44.384 --> 03:12:45.425]  They are behind schedule.
[03:12:45.445 --> 03:12:45.926]  They are shaky.
[03:12:46.006 --> 03:12:47.908]  And now is the time for us to seize our power.
[03:12:58.547 --> 03:13:00.269]  Now is the time for us to seize our power.
[03:13:00.329 --> 03:13:01.150]  I totally agree.
[03:13:01.570 --> 03:13:05.914]  Folks, I don't know about six months, but they certainly are not invincible.
[03:13:05.934 --> 03:13:08.717]  Their vaccine program is blowing up in their face.
[03:13:09.197 --> 03:13:10.979]  People are finding out about world government.
[03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:15.864]  So the establishment is now being forced to admit it, but put their spin on it.
[03:13:17.077 --> 03:13:18.719]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:13:20.541 --> 03:13:26.848]  New York pulled back already, you know, they were doing mandatory and then suddenly they're not doing mandatory.
[03:13:27.188 --> 03:13:34.116]  On October 5th Arnold Schwarzenegger said we will vaccinate every person in the state of California against H1N1.
[03:13:34.136 --> 03:13:34.536]  Today is
[03:13:37.539 --> 03:13:44.743]  One month and six days later, and to date, there has been no forward movement with that attempt.
[03:13:44.783 --> 03:13:45.583]  Look at France.
[03:13:45.723 --> 03:13:46.384]  Look at France.
[03:13:46.424 --> 03:13:50.326]  They said the law, you have to take it, and over 70% have refused.
[03:13:50.386 --> 03:13:51.586]  So, you're right.
[03:13:51.706 --> 03:13:54.488]  People are finally figuring out they're being lied to.
[03:13:55.248 --> 03:14:15.626]  It's just key that we be there, you and others, who have the truth, that everybody be there now that people are waking up, that we be there to give them the truth instead of them stumbling through life, taking another 10 years to find out what, you know, because it took us doing research, you and Bert and myself, you know, decades to figure all this out.
[03:14:16.386 --> 03:14:26.351]  All working separately, now we've gotten a high level of knowledge and people can come into this now and take advantage of all the research that people like yourselves have done.
[03:14:26.371 --> 03:14:30.974]  And they should, and that's why we make all our information available for free.
[03:14:31.334 --> 03:14:35.396]  But I want to mention that the German populace found out
[03:14:36.056 --> 03:14:49.144]  Through people like us, Alex, the German people found out that the politicians and the military were going to get the H1N1 vaccine without squalene, but they were going to get it with squalene.
[03:14:49.304 --> 03:14:51.186]  And they went berserk.
[03:14:51.486 --> 03:14:52.386]  They went berserk.
[03:14:52.487 --> 03:14:56.889]  And now nobody is willing to take the vaccine in Germany.
[03:14:57.089 --> 03:15:00.712]  And in fact, the German government is imposing fines
[03:15:01.833 --> 03:15:07.822]  Financial punishments on doctors when their patients don't take the vaccine.
[03:15:08.122 --> 03:15:14.672]  So now, having miscalculated again, and they do miscalculate a lot, the German doctors are opposing the vaccine.
[03:15:15.458 --> 03:15:19.721]  Yeah, I saw the headline, over 50% are refusing to give it now.
[03:15:19.741 --> 03:15:21.001]  I agree.
[03:15:21.842 --> 03:15:24.784]  General Stubblebine, is that a probe in military terminology?
[03:15:25.084 --> 03:15:36.191]  That we go out, confront them, they overreact and show their true intention, waking up people that weren't on our side, now are, by seeing the bullying of the enemy.
[03:15:37.228 --> 03:15:39.649]  I'd say I would call that a secondary attack.
[03:15:39.889 --> 03:15:56.015]  You know, we know where the primary attack is going to go, but if they put out a probe like that, it's more like a secondary attack to get you to commit, and then they come around and hit you with their primary attack.
[03:15:56.335 --> 03:16:02.758]  So we've got to be very alert to these kinds of tactics.
[03:16:03.658 --> 03:16:12.124]  Well, no, I agree with you on that point.
[03:16:12.785 --> 03:16:23.492]  My point here is that by them trying to force people with fines to take the shot, that caused more people to go, why do you want me to take this so bad?
[03:16:24.693 --> 03:16:28.756]  I'm saying they're pushing us, seems to be blowing up in their face.
[03:16:31.963 --> 03:16:33.785]  And as soon as we reconnect, we'll talk to him.
[03:16:34.386 --> 03:16:35.847]  I've been intending to go to phone calls.
[03:16:35.867 --> 03:16:36.968]  This is kind of fun, though.
[03:16:36.988 --> 03:16:39.351]  It's like we're talking to Mars Base or something.
[03:16:39.371 --> 03:16:40.292]  Hello, this is Houston.
[03:16:41.413 --> 03:16:42.394]  Mars Base, over.
[03:16:43.075 --> 03:16:43.895]  General Stubblebine.
[03:16:44.236 --> 03:16:45.237]  Major General Stubblebine.
[03:16:45.597 --> 03:16:46.678]  And Dr. Labo.
[03:16:47.739 --> 03:16:50.062]  Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
[03:16:51.415 --> 03:16:57.620]  We know the Panama's communication system and its weaknesses very well, but this is exceptional.
[03:16:57.900 --> 03:17:01.123]  We're right on target, Alex, and they don't want this out.
[03:17:01.423 --> 03:17:04.665]  And I say, well, thank you for the confirmation.
[03:17:04.946 --> 03:17:09.209]  And that just tells us all how very important what we're saying is.
[03:17:09.389 --> 03:17:15.233]  Yeah, we interview people down in Panama and even Paraguay and other places, and it never does this.
[03:17:15.273 --> 03:17:15.754]  This is crazy.
[03:17:17.475 --> 03:17:19.176]  I know the Jesse Ventura thing was suspicious.
[03:17:19.196 --> 03:17:20.677]  Somebody was disconnecting that line.
[03:17:21.478 --> 03:17:25.900]  Jesse said when he moved out of the governor's house that the phone company said it was all tapped.
[03:17:26.180 --> 03:17:27.861]  And he got visited by the CIA, too.
[03:17:28.382 --> 03:17:29.022]  Final segment.
[03:17:29.042 --> 03:17:31.083]  We'll jam a few final calls in with our guests.
[03:17:31.464 --> 03:17:33.465]  I meant to get to more, but we've had some technical problems.
[03:17:33.525 --> 03:17:35.246]  Jay, Jeremiah, Paul, Brandon, Holly.
[03:17:35.486 --> 03:17:36.587]  We're going to jam you in here.
[03:17:36.987 --> 03:17:38.088]  Quick questions or comments.
[03:17:38.108 --> 03:17:39.309]  We'll at least get to a couple of you.
[03:17:39.629 --> 03:17:40.970]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:17:40.990 --> 03:17:44.492]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:17:44.752 --> 03:17:46.213]  The rebroadcast is going to be a doozy.
[03:17:46.954 --> 03:17:51.177]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[03:17:51.477 --> 03:17:55.480]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[03:17:55.500 --> 03:18:06.188]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is handpicked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[03:18:06.589 --> 03:18:16.556]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful immune system building blocks defending your body against natural and man-made viruses, but they also assist your body in healing itself from life-threatening
[03:18:16.596 --> 03:18:17.136]  We're good to go.
[03:18:47.981 --> 03:18:51.626]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:18:52.007 --> 03:18:55.011]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:18:55.252 --> 03:18:56.674]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:18:57.378 --> 03:19:00.019]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:19:00.039 --> 03:19:06.260]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:19:06.440 --> 03:19:11.962]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:19:11.982 --> 03:19:21.604]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:19:21.724 --> 03:19:23.846]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:19:24.066 --> 03:19:25.388]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:19:25.668 --> 03:19:27.930]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:19:28.130 --> 03:19:29.972]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:19:30.252 --> 03:19:35.057]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:19:35.397 --> 03:19:40.182]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:19:40.422 --> 03:19:44.526]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:19:48.095 --> 03:19:49.295]  Remain in your houses.
[03:19:50.116 --> 03:19:53.977]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:19:55.878 --> 03:19:56.858]  Will they do it?
[03:19:57.238 --> 03:19:59.199]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:19:59.839 --> 03:20:05.861]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:20:06.301 --> 03:20:07.621]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:20:08.502 --> 03:20:10.542]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[03:20:12.783 --> 03:20:17.065]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:20:17.665 --> 03:20:21.927]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:20:22.567 --> 03:20:27.389]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:36.434]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:20:36.734 --> 03:20:39.016]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:20:39.236 --> 03:20:42.138]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:20:42.298 --> 03:20:45.240]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:20:48.922 --> 03:20:53.165]  You know, it's been two days I've meant to break down and go over what I thought happened at Fort Hood.
[03:20:53.445 --> 03:20:56.367]  You heard Jesse Ventura, he thinks it's a mind control operation.
[03:20:59.053 --> 03:21:02.977]  It looks like a provocateur operation at the bare minimum, and there's so much evidence.
[03:21:03.497 --> 03:21:05.599]  Just when you've studied this, you know what you're looking at.
[03:21:06.420 --> 03:21:07.541]  Very, very suspicious.
[03:21:07.921 --> 03:21:16.549]  Side issue, General Stubblebine, I know more is coming out, you may not want to comment now, but the FBI, the CIA watching him, he was a psychiatrist.
[03:21:18.606 --> 03:21:20.307]  People reported two other shooters.
[03:21:20.587 --> 03:21:22.468]  They said he was dead for six hours.
[03:21:22.948 --> 03:21:25.969]  Now he's cognizant, out of the coma.
[03:21:26.689 --> 03:21:29.230]  It just fits all the past operations.
[03:21:29.250 --> 03:21:32.251]  You've got him launching a new war, expanding the war.
[03:21:33.031 --> 03:21:36.472]  You've got all these other patsies they've just busted that we know were patsies.
[03:21:37.252 --> 03:21:42.334]  Does this stink to you or do you just think this is some crazy running around shooting people at Fort Hood?
[03:21:43.402 --> 03:21:45.143]  No, I don't think it's crazy.
[03:21:45.724 --> 03:21:46.424]  Not at all.
[03:21:46.604 --> 03:21:52.408]  I think something has triggered him.
[03:21:52.669 --> 03:21:53.389]  And who knows?
[03:21:53.849 --> 03:21:55.371]  Did the trigger come from harp?
[03:21:55.991 --> 03:22:07.299]  Did the trigger come from one of the things that have penetrated his skin?
[03:22:07.479 --> 03:22:08.000]  I don't know.
[03:22:09.725 --> 03:22:19.692]  It's very suspicious, though, for somebody to suddenly go on a rampage just because he didn't like war.
[03:22:20.132 --> 03:22:21.233]  He went on a war.
[03:22:22.034 --> 03:22:22.814]  That's what he did.
[03:22:22.834 --> 03:22:25.196]  He says he didn't like war.
[03:22:25.276 --> 03:22:26.977]  It's also entirely possible.
[03:22:26.997 --> 03:22:35.583]  We have to remember that as a psychiatrist, he had virtually unlimited access to any kind of prescription drug that he wanted.
[03:22:38.566 --> 03:22:54.285]  So, what we're looking at, forget about the myoclon, that may be part of it, but what we're looking at just as deeply be pure and simply the neurotoxicity of these
[03:22:54.986 --> 03:22:58.428]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[03:22:58.828 --> 03:23:02.391]  One of the big issues is, minutes after it happened,
[03:23:25.325 --> 03:23:33.568]  Joe Rogan was actually here in the office and I said, Joe, if he turns out to be an Arab or in mental health, you know it's staged.
[03:23:33.628 --> 03:23:35.628]  And then he was an Arab and in mental health.
[03:23:36.108 --> 03:23:38.569]  He fits the classic Manchurian candidate.
[03:23:38.809 --> 03:23:43.291]  We know they hunt for these guys in research programs at universities.
[03:23:43.331 --> 03:23:46.952]  That's when they got Theodore Skazinski, the Unabomber, LA Times.
[03:23:47.532 --> 03:23:49.655]  MKUltra, Alexander Cockburn.
[03:23:50.035 --> 03:23:53.139]  I mean, it's admitted that McVeigh was under mind control.
[03:23:53.479 --> 03:23:55.802]  It's admitted the Unabomber was mind control.
[03:23:56.042 --> 03:24:05.313]  This is mainstream news, so we have to look at this guy when he fits all the earmarks and ask what was going on and why does this serve purposes.
[03:24:05.353 --> 03:24:06.855]  He certainly could be a Muslim extremist.
[03:24:06.875 --> 03:24:07.536]  They do exist.
[03:24:07.916 --> 03:24:09.257]  But this thing stinks to high heaven.
[03:24:09.457 --> 03:24:11.919]  We don't have time for calls because of the audio problem.
[03:24:12.279 --> 03:24:19.284]  The next time we can get a good line, the next few weeks, we will have them back on as soon as we get a clean line down to Central America.
[03:24:19.604 --> 03:24:22.586]  But the website is healthfreedomusa.org.
[03:24:22.806 --> 03:24:32.492]  I want to have you back up soon about the attack on vitamins, the attack on organic foods, and I want to thank Albert N. Stubblebine III and Dr. Reema E. Labo, MD.
[03:24:33.473 --> 03:24:49.162]  I want to thank both of you for the super job you're doing, and I want to encourage everybody to go to healthfreedomusa.org or to go to that email and to get involved as plaintiffs in this suit to block forced inoculation of little kids in New Jersey.
[03:24:49.202 --> 03:24:52.424]  This is such important work you're doing, and I salute both of you.
[03:24:52.724 --> 03:24:54.025]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:24:54.045 --> 03:24:55.586]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:24:55.606 --> 03:24:58.608]  Thank you very much, and don't forget the masks.
[03:24:59.068 --> 03:25:00.229]  We need masks.
[03:25:02.245 --> 03:25:02.785]  Absolutely.
[03:25:02.825 --> 03:25:05.087]  You need plaintiffs right now.
[03:25:05.127 --> 03:25:07.428]  Give us that email address one more time, Dr. Leibov.
[03:25:08.509 --> 03:25:18.974]  Ralph, R-A-L-P-H, dot, Fucetola, F-U-C-E-T-O-L-A, at, USA dot net.
[03:25:18.994 --> 03:25:19.855]  Okay, thank you.
[03:25:19.875 --> 03:25:20.595]  We're out of time.
[03:25:20.855 --> 03:25:21.416]  God bless y'all.
[03:25:21.456 --> 03:25:22.396]  Say bye to y'all off-air.
[03:25:22.656 --> 03:25:25.878]  Jesse Ventura, Judge Napolitano, they're coming up right now.
[03:25:25.958 --> 03:25:27.019]  Infowars.com.
[03:25:29.320 --> 03:25:30.481]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:25:31.806 --> 03:25:34.227]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:25:36.167 --> 03:25:39.108]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:25:39.568 --> 03:25:42.729]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:25:43.170 --> 03:25:47.551]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:25:47.751 --> 03:25:51.892]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[03:25:52.312 --> 03:25:57.514]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
