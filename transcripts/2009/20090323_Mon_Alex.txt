[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.349]  We're good to go.
[00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:28.788]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.428]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.009]  It, of course, is the 23rd day.
[00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:35.450]  It's a Monday of March 2009.
[00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:46.234]  Alan Watt coming up in about five minutes to cover all the latest news and information and break down the New World Order structure that we are all basically being captured in.
[00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:47.548]  Okay.
[00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:52.370]  We just started simulcasting as well at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:56.912]  Let me go ahead and break down in some detail our top story today.
[00:00:56.952 --> 00:01:04.235]  This broke Saturday at InfoWars.com and at Liberty Restoration Project, Big Libertarian Group as well.
[00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:05.315]  I have made phone calls.
[00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.276]  I've confirmed the validity of this document.
[00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:11.738]  Remember two weeks ago we broke the big national story because state police sent us the document.
[00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:20.520]  The federally designed fusion centers all over the United States where they're federalizing local police, putting regular army in the departments.
[00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:34.868]  They sent out this report demonizing Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, Chuck Baldwin supporters, Libertarian Party supporters, Constitutional Party supporters, the Liberty Committee, anybody that believes in North American Union, anybody that believes in a New World Order.
[00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:41.051]  People denied that for a few days, even though the phone number of the state police was there, even though we called the state police, we had state reps on about it.
[00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:46.573]  The governor now has told the Associated Press, Governor Nixon of Missouri, that he stands behind it, it is their document.
[00:01:47.213 --> 00:01:49.514]  It lists bumper stickers on your car, you're probably a terrorist.
[00:01:49.894 --> 00:01:53.236]  Other similar things in San Francisco and Austin, Texas that we've shown here on air.
[00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:58.358]  They're public that have gotten mainstream news, say a road almanac in your car, sign of being a terrorist.
[00:01:58.398 --> 00:01:59.539]  Cell phone, you're a terrorist.
[00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:00.999]  Blue jeans, you're a terrorist.
[00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.900]  You cannot make this up.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.762]  So, they tell the public this is all for imaginary Al-Qaeda, L-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:10.046]  But the whole thing has been built and designed for the American people.
[00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:14.150]  And now NORTHCOM is announcing 20,000 regular troops to engage the American people.
[00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:22.120]  The Army War College is there getting rid of posse comitatus, that they will use the military against the people like a third world country or a dictatorship under Hitler, Stalin, or Mao.
[00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.158]  The John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.200]  PDD 51 says the Congress is ceremonial.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.804]  The Federal Reserve has come out and said Congress, the President, no one can even ask them questions.
[00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:33.765]  They run everything.
[00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:43.954]  Last night's show, the Sunday show, I played the audio clips of them saying this in Congressional hearings and clips from Laird NewsHour with the former Fed Chairman Greenspan saying it.
[00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:46.136]  This is the criminal shadow government
[00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:49.738]  Moving to block the American people's opposition to their tyranny.
[00:02:50.078 --> 00:03:09.449]  So they are the criminals, they are the terrorists, they stage the terror attacks, and then they build up this police state apparatus against the foreign brown people, thinking the public would buy into it, the whole time building the mechanism, the apparatus, to go after the general public and keep us from ever taking our government back from one of their criminal takeovers, which we're in the middle of right now.
[00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.970]  This is a long time in the planning.
[00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.151]  They're now making their move.
[00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.752]  They've openly announced in hundreds of publications that we cover here daily.
[00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:19.512]  Last week it was in probably ten publications we showed on air.
[00:03:19.552 --> 00:03:26.934]  London Telegraph, Associated Press, Reuters, a new bank of the world that you will pay your taxes to, carbon taxes, total control.
[00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:30.255]  The banks will set world interest rates, set currency rates.
[00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.517]  You will pay your taxes to a new Bank of the World.
[00:03:33.877 --> 00:03:37.120]  April 2nd, the G20's meeting again to publicly announce this.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.602]  They're already announcing it in financial publications.
[00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:45.267]  While the public and the mainstream dominant, you know, TV nightly news says, what's Geithner's plan?
[00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:46.067]  No one will tell us.
[00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:46.828]  What are you going to do?
[00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:48.169]  Please save us, Geithner.
[00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.571]  Getting everybody, you know, on the edge of their seat.
[00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:51.912]  Oh, fix things, fix things.
[00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:53.113]  Give us a new Bank of the World.
[00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:54.294]  They'll announce it.
[00:03:54.554 --> 00:03:57.257]  They'll jack the stock market back up and get everybody to go along with it.
[00:03:57.277 --> 00:03:59.999]  They'll say, see Alex, the Bank of the World fixed everything.
[00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:07.504]  Then they'll plunge us back into total control and then expand more power for themselves in the name of fixing the next crisis they create.
[00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:09.746]  So that's where we're going with all of this.
[00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:13.369]  Now, there's some background on the current state of the world and what we're facing.
[00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:26.734]  The Federal Reserve is now secretly, according to Associated Press and the New York Times, and Lennon Telegraph has been for months, as we told you, issuing their own secret currency to themselves to buy up real assets.
[00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:30.035]  The IMF World Bank are issuing super currency.
[00:04:30.055 --> 00:04:31.295]  That's mainstream news now.
[00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:32.195]  It's already happening.
[00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:36.997]  Again, they just make money out of nothing and buy up whatever they want and back it up with our tax dollars.
[00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:39.317]  Now, imagine back in November 22nd,
[00:04:41.534 --> 00:04:58.242]  In 38 locations, every private Federal Reserve branch management bank that then rules over the rest of the banks and insurance companies now through the FDIC, the real government, we went out and protested the real government saying forget Obama, forget Bush, they're all puppets, that's in my film The Obama Deception.
[00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:04.725]  And it's been admitted that arming intelligence tracks and traces
[00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:17.186]  Mainline peace groups, mainline anti-death penalty groups, mainline, you know, Gandhi non-violent groups and calls them terrorists, mainline bike riding groups that want bike lanes.
[00:05:17.487 --> 00:05:20.589]  It's come out in Connecticut and Vermont and New York and Texas.
[00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.630]  Anybody!
[00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.553]  I mean, they go and sit in mainline churches to hear what's being said.
[00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:28.715]  The state police, the feds, all of them.
[00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:32.117]  So all of that is going on, that's been in the news.
[00:05:33.092 --> 00:05:34.412]  And it's a felony when they do it.
[00:05:34.572 --> 00:05:36.013]  I mean, it's a violation of federal law.
[00:05:36.053 --> 00:05:37.313]  The Army's not supposed to do this.
[00:05:37.873 --> 00:05:41.534]  The only time they can watch people is if they're at a military reservation.
[00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:44.474]  But they can't be outside of the reservation watching people.
[00:05:44.534 --> 00:05:52.696]  They were, in this case, the Liberty Restoration Project, and we made calls to confirm down to Camp Mabry, where it's run out of, and Fort Hood.
[00:05:52.736 --> 00:05:53.916]  This is actually run out of Austin.
[00:05:54.476 --> 00:06:00.097]  This is a report put out in Texas, but it says that there's nationwide nexus points
[00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:02.228]  This is being done everywhere.
[00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:04.311]  Through the threat fusion centers.
[00:06:04.712 --> 00:06:06.614]  Same ones that put out the MIAC report, federally written.
[00:06:07.661 --> 00:06:31.502]  uh... that basically uh... people protesting the fed the liberty committee ron paul could be terrorist and maybe planning violent attacks and it tells the police how to be careful how the fbi to be careful the army's there to support them dealing with us so that we may basically decide to attack it tells our officers be very careful these people are deadly dangerous basically uh... and you can read that report
[00:06:32.563 --> 00:06:36.746]  It is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:37.647]  Here is the report.
[00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:42.670]  You can see the order sheet for covering the Houston and Dallas and San Antonio.
[00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:45.512]  Show folks the final page, please.
[00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:54.298]  On the final page, the third page, you can read the officers' names, the orders, what they're doing.
[00:06:54.338 --> 00:06:58.061]  It goes into military safety, how to work with the local police.
[00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:08.187]  Now, this one is different than the MIAC report because it doesn't start out listing cop killers and saying these people want to kill you.
[00:07:09.348 --> 00:07:15.532]  It starts out sounding reasonable, saying what we stand for and what we believe in.
[00:07:15.552 --> 00:07:17.953]  Again, this is secret police.
[00:07:17.973 --> 00:07:20.255]  This is the military watching the American people.
[00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:40.946]  It says the, and let's go to the first page again, the United States Army Reserve Command, again this has already been federalized so it's regular Army, is publishing this Force Protection Advisor to advise all Army Reserve personnel of the planned protest at all Federal Reserve banks and office locations in the United States on the 22nd of November 2008.
[00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:47.808]  This message provides situational awareness and recommended mitigation measures.
[00:07:51.784 --> 00:08:01.568]  Activists will demand an end to private banker control of the nation's money supply and return to the hard, commodity-backed monetary system.
[00:08:01.608 --> 00:08:03.989]  The slogan is simple and direct.
[00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:13.773]  In the Fed, the November 22nd protests are intended as a kickoff of an ongoing campaign to educate and organize the public and take concerted, planned action.
[00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:15.894]  Oh, can't have that with the First Amendment in America.
[00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:25.142]  The consensus action of We The People can save the nation from ruin, plunder, and total socialist tyranny.
[00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:26.224]  The time is now.
[00:08:26.264 --> 00:08:27.867]  The following URL provides an
[00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:33.705]  View of the site that provides information on the scheduled protest.
[00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:35.506]  It's a lot clearer on the screen.
[00:08:35.526 --> 00:08:37.026]  I guess the printer here is going out of ink.
[00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:38.427]  It's my copy, I can barely read it.
[00:08:38.447 --> 00:08:38.707]  You know what?
[00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:39.948]  I'm just going to read it off screen here.
[00:08:40.328 --> 00:08:40.688]  That's better.
[00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:41.708]  I'll look across the room and read it.
[00:08:42.329 --> 00:08:48.031]  The organizers for these planned protests have published the following conduct principles for participation.
[00:08:48.972 --> 00:08:52.733]  All in the Fed organizing groups and participants must agree to the following principles.
[00:08:53.154 --> 00:08:55.615]  Peaceful, non-violent rally to support sound money
[00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:02.571]  Cooperation, respect for local laws and authorities, no harassment of federal employees, no blocking of pedestrian or vehicle traffic.
[00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.092]  But then later they get into basically how we're terrorists.
[00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:07.872]  This is so sick how they could just say this.
[00:09:08.092 --> 00:09:09.132]  It's our First Amendment right.
[00:09:09.413 --> 00:09:13.074]  It's a federal violation of law to have the Army spying on us, but they do it.
[00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.674]  Go ahead and go back to it so I can read it, thanks.
[00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:20.356]  Known locations and events, protests will be held in the following 38 cities.
[00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:25.137]  Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Baltimore, Charlotte,
[00:09:26.187 --> 00:09:30.531]  Atlanta, Birmingham, Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, Chicago, Detroit, St.
[00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:41.762]  Louis, Little Rock, Louisiana, Memphis, Minneapolis, Helena, Kansas City, Denver, Oklahoma City, Omaha, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, San Antonio, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Salt Lake City, Washington, D.C.
[00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:47.848]  The following URL provides an interactive site that provides information on the locations of fellow reserve branches.
[00:09:49.229 --> 00:09:49.869]  Precautions.
[00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:50.810]  This is number five.
[00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.131]  This is out of Texas.
[00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:53.951]  Be aware of your environment at all times.
[00:09:53.972 --> 00:09:57.914]  If you're verbally assaulted, do not retaliate by getting into physical altercations.
[00:09:57.934 --> 00:09:59.494]  This is for the secret police sneaking around.
[00:09:59.935 --> 00:10:03.737]  Whenever you call, call the local law enforcement authorities.
[00:10:05.177 --> 00:10:07.298]  Whenever you can, call the local law enforcement authorities.
[00:10:07.599 --> 00:10:08.459]  Carry your cell phone.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:09.620]  Six.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.421]  UFO, U-O.
[00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:13.602]  Commanders are
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.543]  Remanded at the time to exercise their physical security plan, including all annexes.
[00:10:21.103 --> 00:10:23.884]  That means sub-directives with weapons.
[00:10:25.365 --> 00:10:39.452]  The annexes concerning civil circumstances and communications with federal agencies and local law enforcement agencies should have increased emphasis due to the upcoming protests scheduled throughout the country.
[00:10:39.492 --> 00:10:41.493]  This is the military working with local police.
[00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:41.933]  Continue.
[00:10:44.532 --> 00:10:45.579]  Oh, you're loading the next page.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:45.982]  Okay.
[00:10:48.894 --> 00:10:56.699]  It goes on, commanders at all levels should establish relationships with local police in order to understand the local threats, or the local threats of evil protesters.
[00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:08.666]  Commanders are encouraged to update alert rosters and review emergency evacuation plans, rally points, ensure all facilities have emergency phone listed below, FBI, fire, police, hospitals, EMS, etc.
[00:11:08.906 --> 00:11:11.568]  Because the evil Americans are coming to protest the private bank.
[00:11:12.148 --> 00:11:15.931]  Commanders will ensure that random anti-terrorism measures
[00:11:16.491 --> 00:11:19.938]  Program is conducted as an integral part of their daily operations.
[00:11:19.998 --> 00:11:20.919]  See, we're terrorists.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.788]  RAM is particularly important due to the static nature of our forces and mission.
[00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.174]  Which often result in the establishment of identifiable routes.
[00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:34.358]  Man, they gotta sneak when they come there, because we're so dangerous.
[00:11:34.378 --> 00:11:35.419]  We may attack them.
[00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:37.742]  See, now, oh, they want to attack you.
[00:11:38.242 --> 00:11:39.243]  Oh, they want to go after you.
[00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:47.653]  Report all potential protest activities to the Army Reserve Operations Center, AROC, listed in paragraph 8 below.
[00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:55.532]  And then it lists where this is located and there is actually a phone number here you can call and email addresses for you.
[00:11:55.552 --> 00:11:58.094]  We're going to come back and Alan Watts take on this and cover it.
[00:11:58.194 --> 00:11:58.714]  You worry.
[00:11:59.095 --> 00:12:00.816]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:12:01.157 --> 00:12:03.378]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:05.600]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[00:12:05.941 --> 00:12:07.142]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:12:07.542 --> 00:12:10.745]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:12:11.145 --> 00:12:15.969]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:12:16.363 --> 00:12:19.684]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:12:20.324 --> 00:12:21.664]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:24.605]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:12:24.905 --> 00:12:27.865]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:36.547]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.
[00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:41.368]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it.

[00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:50.301]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:52.222]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:12:58.266 --> 00:13:00.148]  Good day, Jim Newcover from Midas Resources.
[00:13:00.368 --> 00:13:00.608]  March 23rd, 2009.
[00:13:00.688 --> 00:13:01.669]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5050.
[00:13:01.709 --> 00:13:05.091]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7767, $4.8884 for the half-ounce, and $2.4442 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:05.372]  That's $9.7767, $4.8884, or $2.4442.
[00:13:17.153 --> 00:13:20.774]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:23.855]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:13:23.955 --> 00:13:33.118]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:38.759]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.021]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the US dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:13:44.461 --> 00:13:46.542]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:13:47.822 --> 00:13:51.543]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:54.164]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:13:54.204 --> 00:13:54.944]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:13:55.644 --> 00:14:03.686]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:14:04.206 --> 00:14:11.168]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:17.956]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:14:18.356 --> 00:14:20.178]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:14:20.338 --> 00:14:22.740]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:33.770]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:35.692]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:36.093 --> 00:14:37.454]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:14:37.927 --> 00:14:44.253]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:52.620]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.241]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:54.682 --> 00:14:55.883]  The people strike back.
[00:14:58.434 --> 00:15:03.899]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:15:03.939 --> 00:15:04.459]  and the world.
[00:15:04.739 --> 00:15:08.182]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:15:08.602 --> 00:15:14.828]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:15:15.108 --> 00:15:16.889]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:15:17.129 --> 00:15:25.076]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:15:25.336 --> 00:15:29.782]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:15:30.042 --> 00:15:35.589]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:37.872]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:15:38.032 --> 00:15:40.295]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:15:40.635 --> 00:15:41.415]  Free of charge.
[00:15:41.715 --> 00:15:42.015]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[00:15:42.035 --> 00:15:42.096]  1-800-453-2202.
[00:15:42.116 --> 00:15:44.436]  Or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:44.996]  Factory direct.
[00:15:45.017 --> 00:15:46.477]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:15:46.497 --> 00:15:47.037]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:47.737]  We are back live.
[00:15:47.757 --> 00:15:49.558]  Alan Watt with us for the next hour and 40 minutes.
[00:16:11.664 --> 00:16:16.408]  Out of respect for the guest, I'm going to go ahead and go to him now, but I want to finish up later in this hour with the Army Report.
[00:16:17.488 --> 00:16:20.491]  We're calling him again right now, trying to get an interview with him.
[00:16:21.331 --> 00:16:22.672]  Why are they spying on Americans?
[00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:24.173]  Why are they following protesters?
[00:16:24.614 --> 00:16:28.397]  But the fact is, this was leaked to us, just like the state police leaked us the other documents.
[00:16:28.837 --> 00:16:30.758]  They don't like what's happening.
[00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:33.340]  They're upset about what's going on in this country.
[00:16:34.601 --> 00:16:35.362]  But meanwhile,
[00:16:37.099 --> 00:16:47.788]  They are creating a $13 million, and they plan to double that in the next few months, to go knock on your doors, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, as we told you six months ago, and it's in the Obama deception.
[00:16:49.381 --> 00:17:04.388]  Literal classic fascism to push pro-Federal Reserve doctrine and ideas, but then meanwhile, if you're against the Federal Reserve, when exercising your First Amendment, you're a dangerous terrorist and they're telling the army who's spying on us, look out, because these are dangerous terrorists, they may try to kill you.
[00:17:04.408 --> 00:17:08.890]  I mean, you know, how to protect themselves, how to sneak to the location, how to have weapons, how to look out.
[00:17:09.551 --> 00:17:10.591]  I mean, this is slander.
[00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:11.712]  This is demonization.
[00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:14.393]  Alan Watt, I tell you, things are really intensifying.
[00:17:15.632 --> 00:17:17.653]  Yes, they are across the whole world.
[00:17:17.693 --> 00:17:22.594]  In fact, every country has got its own little program on par with this, in fact.
[00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:27.476]  And it's the creation of total, total tyranny, basically.
[00:17:28.076 --> 00:17:39.220]  And the message is to get it out to the public by the elite themselves, that they are going to stand no nonsense, that they're trying to cow the public into silence and submission by terrorizing them, basically.
[00:17:40.223 --> 00:17:43.907]  And people are generally afraid of being put on a list of some kind or another.
[00:17:44.268 --> 00:17:50.955]  I tell them not to worry because you're already on some kind of list, if you think at all, whether you know it or not.
[00:17:51.756 --> 00:17:57.122]  And you have to speak now because we're going into the worst tyranny this planet has ever seen.
[00:17:57.162 --> 00:17:57.783]  This is global.
[00:17:59.517 --> 00:18:00.357]  You're absolutely right.
[00:18:00.617 --> 00:18:08.620]  This is done as a chilling effect and they want the public to know that Army Intelligence is watching major churches and everybody else.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.421]  They want the people to know they're committing these federal crimes.
[00:18:11.481 --> 00:18:12.821]  It is a federal crime to do this.
[00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:19.963]  They suddenly are putting troops at checkpoints and shootings and just to get everybody prepared for that as they implode the world economy.
[00:18:19.983 --> 00:18:21.844]  And the answer is all of us getting on a list.
[00:18:22.264 --> 00:18:26.145]  They can't get all of us and we have to stand up and say, no, what you're doing is criminal.
[00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:28.126]  What you're doing is wrong.
[00:18:29.605 --> 00:18:36.050]  For those that don't know world history, is this not classic tyranny to have secret police with the military spying on the American people?
[00:18:37.171 --> 00:18:50.201]  It is absolutely classic, and now we have Britain admitting not only are they training 60,000 people to spy on the general public from within the general public all the way down to chambermaids in hotels,
[00:18:51.102 --> 00:18:54.303]  But they've already trained thousands of people already quietly.
[00:18:54.323 --> 00:18:58.063]  Well, where did this go through any parliamentary bill?
[00:18:58.083 --> 00:18:59.864]  It was never discussed anywhere.
[00:19:00.644 --> 00:19:02.044]  So really, they're beyond the law.
[00:19:02.064 --> 00:19:03.205]  They're beyond democracy.
[00:19:03.265 --> 00:19:05.025]  They're beyond parliaments and Congress.
[00:19:05.865 --> 00:19:10.206]  There's a much higher force at work here dictating what's happening.
[00:19:10.786 --> 00:19:16.707]  And to be honest with you, we lost all of that during the Cold War when the intelligence agencies took over.
[00:19:17.227 --> 00:19:19.848]  And even politicians were not allowed to know what they were up to.
[00:19:20.638 --> 00:19:35.785]  These high agencies respond to a much higher government, an elected government, comprising of the bankers, of the ultra-rich and elite, and again all the foundations that front for them with their NGOs.
[00:19:36.265 --> 00:19:39.146]  So they're bypassing all the usual channels.
[00:19:39.206 --> 00:19:40.167]  In fact, as I say,
[00:19:41.034 --> 00:19:50.722]  When you go into the writings of the big think tanks that work for this global system on behalf of the elite, like the Club of Rome, they said that democracy was just too cumbersome.
[00:19:51.002 --> 00:19:52.323]  They wanted collectivism.
[00:19:52.684 --> 00:19:56.287]  Under collectivism, you're looking at China, basically.
[00:19:56.867 --> 00:19:57.267]  We're good to go.
[00:20:19.125 --> 00:20:27.769]  Yeah, it's a criminal group of parasites sitting above society calling it capitalist and free market while they suck the population dry.
[00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:38.315]  You know, for those that said we were making it up from his own book and his own documents that they were going to set up youth brigades, a million-person domestic spy force, but also serve overseas, the House passed
[00:20:38.775 --> 00:20:39.095]  Absolute denial.
[00:20:39.135 --> 00:20:39.736]  They cannot believe it.
[00:20:39.756 --> 00:20:41.158]  Again, you have a generation that's grown up.
[00:20:41.178 --> 00:20:42.159]  They've forgotten everything.
[00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:43.440]  They've been taught very little at school.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.903]  They've never lived through the hard times.
[00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:03.094]  Thank you for your time.
[00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:22.807]  Uh, and have not, have no history to fall back on, no personal experience of what tyranny can be, or martial law.
[00:21:23.227 --> 00:21:26.868]  So, to them it's all brand new, and they're in utter and complete denial.
[00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:27.708]  Absolutely.
[00:21:27.728 --> 00:21:30.569]  And, now that they're taking the old system away, they're giving them the new one.
[00:21:31.229 --> 00:21:40.412]  Force compulsory service, tattletale brigades, 13 person, 13 million person, squads marching the streets, gun control, it's all happening right now.
[00:21:40.492 --> 00:21:41.392]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[00:21:48.078 --> 00:21:49.138]  We're on the march.
[00:21:49.479 --> 00:21:51.059]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:54.781]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:58.142 --> 00:22:00.102]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock.
[00:22:00.142 --> 00:22:01.983]  And what I'm about to tell you is true.
[00:22:02.123 --> 00:22:05.665]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[00:22:06.965 --> 00:22:09.726]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[00:22:09.886 --> 00:22:14.208]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[00:22:14.368 --> 00:22:15.108]  Every three seconds.
[00:22:15.488 --> 00:22:16.969]  Someone's identity is stolen.
[00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:18.871]  It's not just the money that's being stolen.
[00:22:18.931 --> 00:22:23.274]  It's your reputation, your credits, and your valuable time to fix the huge mess.
[00:22:23.494 --> 00:22:26.816]  At LifeLock, we aim to prevent identity theft before it happens.
[00:22:27.037 --> 00:22:34.022]  And if anything happens while you're a client of LifeLock, you'll be protected by our exclusive $1 million total service guarantee.
[00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:38.405]  With LifeLock, you'll also see a huge reduction in junk mail and pre-approved credit offers.
[00:22:38.445 --> 00:22:39.005]  Call 1-800-605-4229 right now.
[00:22:41.567 --> 00:22:43.948]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:04.805 --> 00:23:10.147]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:10.688 --> 00:23:16.870]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.991]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:21.532]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:23:21.612 --> 00:23:32.517]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.051]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:36.452 --> 00:23:37.853]  It's about a one world government.
[00:23:38.313 --> 00:23:44.639]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:53.487 --> 00:23:54.648]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:56.250]  The people strike back.
[00:23:57.947 --> 00:24:02.669]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:09.371]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free, and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[00:24:10.112 --> 00:24:18.495]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[00:24:19.135 --> 00:24:26.558]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:32.601]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[00:24:32.621 --> 00:24:40.544]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[00:24:41.164 --> 00:24:47.986]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[00:24:48.786 --> 00:24:50.767]  So don't delay, call today.
[00:24:54.249 --> 00:24:57.411]  And see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you!
[00:25:13.524 --> 00:25:35.781]  Right now, up on InfoWars.com, they finally got us the letter, it's not published anywhere else, that was mailed by Ron Paul, Bob Barr, and of course Chuck Baldwin to the governor, whose seal was on the top of the federally written document, saying people with Ron Paul stickers are basically terrorists and there's no such thing as the North American Union, and that if you talk about it, you basically are a cop killer.
[00:25:37.085 --> 00:25:39.967]  And so that's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:25:40.327 --> 00:25:43.449]  This brainwashing of the police and the military.
[00:25:44.891 --> 00:25:48.093]  Ron Paul did get more political contributions than any other candidate combined.
[00:25:48.133 --> 00:25:50.174]  The police and military I talked to are waking up.
[00:25:50.675 --> 00:25:57.179]  The elite are not invincible, Alan, and I do see a lot of their people waking up thanks to your work and my work and many other people's work.
[00:25:57.759 --> 00:26:02.203]  I mean, they're certainly moving on us on every front, but there is a big awakening happening.
[00:26:02.223 --> 00:26:03.964]  I mean, I think we've got some hope here.
[00:26:05.345 --> 00:26:06.066]  It's an awakening.
[00:26:06.507 --> 00:26:08.349]  It's a dicey time for those in control.
[00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:11.092]  This is a plan, remember, that we're living through.
[00:26:11.112 --> 00:26:15.238]  This stage of it, I have no doubt, was planned probably 50 years ago or more.
[00:26:16.235 --> 00:26:19.679]  And, uh, it's a very delicate position for them to go through.
[00:26:19.699 --> 00:26:25.144]  That's why they're using the heavy hand and fear tactics to terrify the public, to just go along with it.
[00:26:25.284 --> 00:26:26.606]  But that's a risk for them!
[00:26:27.186 --> 00:26:36.416]  You and others always said that when they finally emerged and went for the World Bank of the World, you know, global government, that by revealing themselves, that was the weak point because they've always been denying it previously.
[00:26:37.088 --> 00:26:41.113]  That's right, and they're well aware, they are well aware that they could lose this.
[00:26:41.173 --> 00:26:45.798]  That's why they're going to use every tactic possible to keep it on course.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.524]  But yeah, it's a very delicate position for them, if the people care enough.
[00:26:51.265 --> 00:26:53.668]  The people generally care enough when they have nothing left.
[00:26:54.534 --> 00:26:55.235]  Unfortunately.
[00:26:55.315 --> 00:26:56.677]  And by that time, it's too late.
[00:26:56.697 --> 00:27:02.603]  You have to be able to think rationally when you're well-fed and all the rest of it to do what you have to do.
[00:27:03.124 --> 00:27:11.814]  And there's no point sitting quietly, answering questions to someone coming to your door to make sure you're a good little citizen who's going to comply with all the new rules.
[00:27:12.134 --> 00:27:12.674]  That's right.
[00:27:12.694 --> 00:27:13.696]  Start being vocal now.
[00:27:14.446 --> 00:27:15.107]  I agree with you.
[00:27:15.147 --> 00:27:25.880]  Before they have us in the full depression and pose as our saviors so that we will accept that in the FEMA camps for our safety, people begging in waiting lines to get into the camps.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:33.329]  Always when they did urban warfare drills that I would videotape over a decade ago, they would have the role players screaming, I'm an American, let me in the camp.
[00:27:34.009 --> 00:27:39.992]  And then there'd be a few who didn't want to go to the camp, but most were begging to get in, and now that's how they're selling it today.
[00:27:40.332 --> 00:27:47.456]  We need to get in the face of these thugs, these people knocking on our doors, these neighbors spying on us, and let everybody know that this is criminal.
[00:27:47.496 --> 00:27:48.536]  This is anti-freedom.
[00:27:48.556 --> 00:27:49.737]  This is classical tyranny.
[00:27:50.137 --> 00:27:52.838]  This is what happened in China and is still going on in China.
[00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:53.679]  This is
[00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:58.923]  The criminal elite trying to have a complete and total criminal takeover.
[00:27:58.963 --> 00:28:08.070]  And Alan, I totally agree with you that we've got to screen bloody murder now and point out that it's the private Federal Reserve and the New World Order globally that are carrying this out.
[00:28:08.271 --> 00:28:14.055]  That's why they're so scared of us protesting the Fed and getting media attention and pointing out they're the bad guys.
[00:28:14.095 --> 00:28:16.537]  That's why while we were there protesting the Fed in Dallas,
[00:28:17.378 --> 00:28:26.522]  They had over 200 professors and schoolteachers in there indoctrinating them and paying them to be part of a course to go out and then brainwash people about how great the Federal Reserve is.
[00:28:26.542 --> 00:28:30.424]  So they've got a massive PR campaign admittedly going right now.
[00:28:31.545 --> 00:28:34.146]  Yes, and I think Solzhenitsyn was quite right.
[00:28:34.206 --> 00:28:36.667]  He said that you have to stop this right at the beginning.
[00:28:36.687 --> 00:28:42.430]  They said once they get going, and what they did in the Soviet system, and I can see it coming down here, they're copying it.
[00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.251]  That was a trial for the whole world.
[00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:55.034]  They turned out the whole street when the KGB went in to arrest a couple of people and drag them out to make sure that everyone got the message to terrify everybody in the street.
[00:28:55.615 --> 00:28:58.295]  And that made everyone draw into their little cell.
[00:28:58.315 --> 00:28:59.496]  They didn't talk to their neighbors.
[00:28:59.536 --> 00:29:03.117]  You just went through life quietly looking at the ground, the sidewalk.
[00:29:03.897 --> 00:29:12.000]  And that's what they hope to use here for a whole generation while they go through this whole course into the next step of globalization.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.461]  So we can't let that happen.
[00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:14.561]  You've got to hit it right now.
[00:29:15.349 --> 00:29:16.170]  And don't be afraid.
[00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:19.252]  Yeah, right now is the crossroads.
[00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:21.454]  Either they win or we defeat them.
[00:29:21.574 --> 00:29:28.640]  Right now, the good news is, as I was saying earlier, the resistance to this tyranny is really mounting and a lot of people see it.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:35.185]  But on top of that, I get dozens of articles every day, just like this one, and I'm so busy, I never even cover half of them.
[00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:38.067]  Alan, here is the Associated Press.
[00:29:39.268 --> 00:29:42.431]  This is the Associated Press today.
[00:29:44.145 --> 00:29:46.726]  And you'd think you were living in communist Russia to hear this.
[00:29:46.806 --> 00:29:49.187]  Hillary, the movie, now showing at Supreme Court.
[00:29:50.147 --> 00:30:09.773]  And you read the article, it says, the Supreme Court will decide if you're allowed to make a film criticizing government leaders, and that it is under election law now to make a film criticizing any elected official, and that they're deciding, not just the Fairness Doctrine for talk radio,
[00:30:10.353 --> 00:30:13.941]  But they're deciding to restrict free speech on the internet, everything.
[00:30:13.981 --> 00:30:16.466]  That's what the Violent Radicalization Act is about.
[00:30:16.486 --> 00:30:21.476]  That's what these different... I mean, the article actually says that
[00:30:22.395 --> 00:30:25.916]  That they may basically ban this movie and not let it be shown or be seen.
[00:30:25.936 --> 00:30:28.996]  And this fight's been going on since last year during the election.
[00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:46.159]  But meanwhile, Obama and the government can run national TV ads advertising people to join usaservice.org, which is a private Democratic Party group with 13 million, San Francisco Chronicle reported, and he announced it on Jay Leno, knocking on your door saying, do you pledge?
[00:30:46.199 --> 00:30:46.960]  Are you with us?
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.020]  I mean, this is happening faster than I thought.
[00:30:50.322 --> 00:30:51.803]  Yeah, again, because it was planned that way.
[00:30:51.923 --> 00:30:54.145]  Long before Obama, we even heard his name.
[00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:56.647]  He was groomed for this to take over from Bush.
[00:30:57.207 --> 00:31:00.550]  They had them all set up like ducks in a row for the decade.
[00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.971]  And this is all planned ahead.
[00:31:03.012 --> 00:31:06.474]  That's why it's going ahead so quickly, smoothly, because it was all done.
[00:31:06.534 --> 00:31:07.735]  All the paperwork was done.
[00:31:07.815 --> 00:31:12.719]  Implementation techniques were worked out before he was even elected into office.
[00:31:13.119 --> 00:31:15.121]  So this is why it's going this way.
[00:31:15.361 --> 00:31:16.862]  The same thing happened in Britain.
[00:31:17.382 --> 00:31:20.203]  Yeah, you have a big organization called Common Purpose.
[00:31:20.363 --> 00:31:24.644]  It uses the techniques of the Royal Institute for International Affairs, or the CFR.
[00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:35.946]  It has military commanders as members of it, high commanders, and high police officials, MI6 and all the rest of it, which tells me that this is a branch that's already been trained.
[00:31:35.966 --> 00:31:39.046]  This is a new NGO that's been trained by Mr. Brown.
[00:31:39.066 --> 00:31:40.667]  As he said, they've already trained thousands.
[00:31:40.987 --> 00:31:42.767]  That falls right into that category.
[00:31:43.107 --> 00:31:46.128]  So they're using these strange civilian systems
[00:31:46.568 --> 00:31:49.910]  Yeah, the quote is, it would be better off if we never had the internet.
[00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:50.291]  Go ahead.
[00:32:15.828 --> 00:32:23.894]  That's right, and then you tie that in with Australia, where, now, whatever happens in the world today, you can guarantee it's going to work across the board, across the whole world.
[00:32:24.355 --> 00:32:31.620]  In Australia, they're going to start, they're going to fine people $11,000 per day for having illegal sites up on the web.
[00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:34.643]  And these illegal sites are banned by the government.
[00:32:34.923 --> 00:32:38.566]  You won't even know if you're on the list until... It's only mainstream news!
[00:32:39.026 --> 00:32:39.747]  Hyperlink!
[00:32:40.367 --> 00:32:57.202]  If you hyperlink to Wikilinks or any of these sites, thousands and thousands being added a week, then, and it's up to you to know if it's a banned site, and then the headline is, Chinese style net censorship coming, the government says that themselves and says you'll only be able to visit a few thousand sites.
[00:32:57.802 --> 00:33:19.115]  And I was listening to the British Lord, the inventor of the internet, on BBC this weekend in the car, on XM, and he admitted, yes, we're killing the old web right now, and everything you do is being tracked and traced, and the New York Times a month ago announced, we are getting rid of the old web, it will be a safer, friendlier, gatekeep, they use that term, gatekeeping web, that we control.
[00:33:19.155 --> 00:33:21.337]  Now, just backing you up, going back about two minutes,
[00:33:22.515 --> 00:33:32.541]  I want you to continue on the line of censorship, how they're bringing out this diametrically opposed to liberty and freedom and the Magna Carta and Bill of Rights and just basic freedom, this obvious criminality by the state.
[00:33:34.683 --> 00:33:36.624]  You mentioned almost military level clearance.
[00:33:37.124 --> 00:33:48.512]  Under InfraGard, 50,000 executives in infrastructure protection, they're armed, they're trained by the FBI secretly, now it's in the Associated Press, with shoot-to-kill orders of whoever they're told to kill in their company when the FBI tells them.
[00:33:49.452 --> 00:33:54.953]  They have the 26,000 clergy response teams preparing everybody to go to the camps and take forced inoculations.
[00:33:54.993 --> 00:33:56.614]  We told you a year and a half before it was declassified.
[00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:58.234]  It's now public, mainstream news.
[00:33:59.214 --> 00:34:03.775]  And they've now announced this one million man, and the Pentagon put out the directive a month ago.
[00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:05.235]  Obama's now announced it.
[00:34:05.275 --> 00:34:08.176]  The House passed it Friday, Thursday, excuse me.
[00:34:08.556 --> 00:34:09.456]  We read the bill on air.
[00:34:09.476 --> 00:34:10.777]  It's now passed, going to the Senate.
[00:34:10.837 --> 00:34:11.897]  Sure to pass it, they're saying.
[00:34:12.277 --> 00:34:15.738]  There's no big debate about it, only a few mainstream articles, and we've covered it.
[00:34:16.778 --> 00:34:17.438]  And they say,
[00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:32.583]  That they're setting up a body to organize the compulsory service of the American people from middle school to age 65 and a 1 million person 18 to 24 cadre that will serve domestically and overseas in the Army.
[00:34:33.763 --> 00:34:38.965]  The Defense Department directive states, we've read this on air the last three shows in a row, read it last night,
[00:34:40.138 --> 00:34:42.119]  It's up on presentplanet.com, a link to the Pentagon.
[00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:46.421]  They say it will be compulsory and they will tell you to be here or overseas.
[00:34:46.762 --> 00:34:51.504]  I mean, this is literal Joseph Stalin, Marcus Wolf level.
[00:34:52.144 --> 00:34:53.225]  Yeah, it's right in the open.
[00:34:53.445 --> 00:34:55.826]  Openly, absolutely.
[00:34:56.066 --> 00:35:00.949]  But it even amazes me, Alan, that this quick, this fast, this overwhelming
[00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:12.118]  I mean, if they were shooting for tyranny and there's a score of 1 to 100, they are getting a 110, you know, with a triple stars bonus.
[00:35:12.498 --> 00:35:15.739]  Yeah, they have to go the whole way fast.
[00:35:16.579 --> 00:35:19.479]  They can't just implement at a stage at a time and take the flak.
[00:35:19.519 --> 00:35:27.081]  They're trying to use a shock tactic and run it all through at once and then deal with any comeback from it, any fallback.
[00:35:28.052 --> 00:35:29.453]  This is literally Red Dawn.
[00:35:29.553 --> 00:35:39.376]  I mean this is classic military standing by watching the American people while the banks openly destroy the economy by design and openly announce world government.
[00:35:39.976 --> 00:35:40.376]  That's right.
[00:35:40.436 --> 00:35:44.538]  That's what the World Bank was set up to do and the United Nations as well.
[00:35:44.898 --> 00:35:50.420]  Back at the books written at the time when they were setting up the UN and they mentioned all these institutions
[00:35:50.945 --> 00:35:58.152]  And he said that probably the World Bank will not come up to its full purpose power for about 50 years.
[00:35:58.192 --> 00:35:59.173]  Well, we're right on target.
[00:36:00.815 --> 00:36:01.055]  I know.
[00:36:01.095 --> 00:36:02.997]  It's just amazing, Alan, to know this.
[00:36:03.077 --> 00:36:04.438]  And I want listeners to understand something.
[00:36:04.478 --> 00:36:06.961]  We've posted all the government bills, all the documents.
[00:36:08.772 --> 00:36:09.452]  This is real.
[00:36:09.492 --> 00:36:10.172]  This is happening.
[00:36:10.213 --> 00:36:11.293]  We're not exaggerating.
[00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:18.095]  In fact, it's so bad, it's so huge, that I can't even in one show list all of the evidence.
[00:36:18.175 --> 00:36:21.116]  I mean, it's admitted that they're doing this.
[00:36:22.077 --> 00:36:22.997]  Yes, it's in the open.
[00:36:23.057 --> 00:36:25.358]  It's a shock and awe tactic they're using.
[00:36:26.078 --> 00:36:28.159]  Because most people, as you say, cannot believe it.
[00:36:28.299 --> 00:36:29.139]  It's overwhelming.
[00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:35.901]  And most of them are not used, most of the public, truly, honestly, are not used to thinking about what they hear.
[00:36:36.081 --> 00:36:38.122]  It goes in one ear, out the other.
[00:36:38.795 --> 00:36:41.656]  They won't believe it until their sons and daughters are whisked off.
[00:36:42.216 --> 00:36:47.958]  And they themselves are pushed in, if they're under 65 or whatever, into serving in some capacity or another.
[00:36:50.118 --> 00:36:51.599]  Well, I mean, I could go over it.
[00:36:51.619 --> 00:36:57.501]  It's got an EnviroCorps, EnvironmentCorps, GreenCorps, SecurityCorps.
[00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:01.562]  In fact, I've got it in my stack out there, guys.
[00:37:02.762 --> 00:37:07.184]  From last night's show, will you bring me the big huge stack over there on the table?
[00:37:07.204 --> 00:37:09.125]  I know there's like five stacks, it's the big one.
[00:37:09.485 --> 00:37:11.746]  You know, I'll get it during a break, it doesn't matter, you'll bring me the wrong stack.
[00:37:12.206 --> 00:37:13.667]  You couldn't know where it is, it doesn't matter.
[00:37:13.907 --> 00:37:15.268]  It's right over there on the conference table.
[00:37:16.408 --> 00:37:17.609]  No, no, just forget it, just forget it.
[00:37:17.629 --> 00:37:19.950]  I don't want all the stacks, there's like 50 stacks out there.
[00:37:21.189 --> 00:37:22.390]  You know, what's the point?
[00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:27.252]  I mean, I keep covering it, giving them the subsections, giving them where it says it, how they're doing it.
[00:37:27.793 --> 00:37:29.053]  It's just mind-blowing, Alan.
[00:37:29.073 --> 00:37:29.894]  I keep saying that.
[00:37:29.934 --> 00:37:34.016]  I mean, don't people understand this is classic hardcore tyranny?
[00:37:35.017 --> 00:37:35.337]  They don't.
[00:37:35.357 --> 00:37:46.643]  It's just that a generation has grown up, really, living with fantasy and virtual reality, and the older generation has been dying off with memory of what tyranny was all about.
[00:37:47.526 --> 00:37:50.108]  And therefore it's brand new again for this generation.
[00:37:50.128 --> 00:38:00.975]  They've been almost mollycoddled to an extent for quite some time living in entertainment land and they cannot tell the difference between reality and fiction.
[00:38:01.395 --> 00:38:05.438]  It's all blended together like some bizarre talk show on television.
[00:38:05.798 --> 00:38:08.560]  So that's how their life is to most of them.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.843]  Now in the 40s there was a guy, an archbishop in fact of Britain,
[00:38:13.467 --> 00:38:14.228]  We're good to go.
[00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.852]  And that's what George Orwell was talking about in 1984.
[00:38:34.652 --> 00:38:48.844]  The ability to believe everything you're told today, when you're given a new reality tomorrow, you must delete your old realities that never existed and be politically correct, day by day, week by week, etc.
[00:38:49.724 --> 00:38:55.189]  And we're seeing that now with the whole thing with Gulf War I into Gulf War II.
[00:38:55.889 --> 00:38:59.172]  You start off with Afghanistan, they changed their sights into Iraq.
[00:38:59.778 --> 00:39:01.138]  Then they change it to Iran.
[00:39:01.458 --> 00:39:03.279]  Now they're going for Pakistan.
[00:39:03.299 --> 00:39:04.579]  They keep changing their enemy.
[00:39:04.839 --> 00:39:05.939]  Who are we fighting today?
[00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:07.460]  East Asia or West Asia?
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.080]  And you better believe it's always been West Asia or whoever they tell you.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.140]  That's what's coming.
[00:39:12.481 --> 00:39:18.142]  A hyperspeed, constant upgrade to everybody to be politically correct at all times.
[00:39:18.162 --> 00:39:24.743]  And they're going to need monitors to make sure that the program is working with us and we are upgraded all through our lives.
[00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:36.232]  That's right, the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, the different think tanks, Tavistock and the UN and others bragged, and we've read these documents on air, that
[00:39:37.870 --> 00:40:06.889]  What they would do is bankrupt everybody, get everybody dependent, get everybody institutionalized, finally bankrupt the middle class, and then your job will be continual education that's government paid for, and then they'll put you in government jobs while the brainwashing and the continuing education continues, always giving you the new reality, downloading it, and now that's what they admit the new world order is going to be, is basically a giant re-education camp, and they play this off on these fools.
[00:40:06.929 --> 00:40:07.310]  They tell them,
[00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.132]  You've got to do what Obama says or the economy won't get better.
[00:40:11.212 --> 00:40:14.414]  It's the people that are fighting Obama that are causing this to happen.
[00:40:14.475 --> 00:40:16.216]  Obama's fighting the special interest.
[00:40:16.536 --> 00:40:22.820]  That's why 13 million of them need to go door-to-door, banging on people's doors, demanding they pledge to accept the banker takeover.
[00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:27.944]  And these fools really believe they're fighting the establishment.
[00:40:28.764 --> 00:40:33.788]  As they are part of this, as the establishment openly is the author of the entire thing.
[00:40:34.408 --> 00:40:39.752]  And you talk to Obama supporters and they say, he never said he wasn't going to hire a lobbyist.
[00:40:39.852 --> 00:40:42.254]  He never said he wasn't going to bring the troops home.
[00:40:42.634 --> 00:40:45.256]  He never said that he was going to do any of that.
[00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.077]  And I go, yes he did.
[00:40:46.097 --> 00:40:47.118]  And they go, no he didn't.
[00:40:47.138 --> 00:40:48.539]  You're just an evil Republican.
[00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:50.880]  And you say, no, you're caught in the left-right paradigm.
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.342]  They control you with that bait-and-switch.
[00:40:52.362 --> 00:40:54.123]  And they go, shut up, Republican!
[00:40:54.343 --> 00:40:55.444]  You lost the election.
[00:40:55.664 --> 00:40:56.104]  I won.
[00:40:57.426 --> 00:41:07.288]  I see that in the comments on my film online, is every other comment that disagrees says, hey, get over it, you lost Republicans, get over it, Obama's going to beat you.
[00:41:07.648 --> 00:41:09.729]  You know what, we're going to arrest you right-wingers.
[00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:11.629]  You know, he's going to bring in a heaven.
[00:41:11.689 --> 00:41:13.269]  I'm not going to have bills anymore.
[00:41:13.789 --> 00:41:14.870]  And in a way, they're not.
[00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:25.712]  They're going to be in little uniforms and little brigades on power trips, you know, totally dumbed down fluoride heads, ADIQs, just totally going insane, just like Hitler's brown shirts.
[00:41:27.206 --> 00:41:27.867]  There's no doubt.
[00:41:27.947 --> 00:41:28.928]  This is a formula.
[00:41:29.088 --> 00:41:36.455]  What you're seeing is a formula that's well tried and tested over centuries, many centuries, and they know exactly how to implement it.
[00:41:36.495 --> 00:41:44.682]  As I say, it's obvious that the whole formula was set up and the machinery to implement it was set up long before Obama was even heard of.
[00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:47.625]  Alan, what are we doing?
[00:41:47.665 --> 00:41:49.206]  This takes time to get going.
[00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:50.668]  This is rolling already.
[00:41:51.248 --> 00:41:53.270]  You can do it yourself when you put something forward.
[00:41:54.026 --> 00:42:01.712]  Before it becomes a bill or anything else, it takes sometimes years to get through all the different details, etc., back to committee, etc.
[00:42:02.072 --> 00:42:03.634]  This is already implemented to go.
[00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:11.240]  Yeah, you're an amazing individual, Alan, because you research the same core documents I do in great detail, and we're very honored to have you.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.644]  Your website is cuttingthroughthematrix.com, and then you have a European mirror, don't you?
[00:42:17.644 --> 00:42:19.406]  Yeah, that's alanwattsentinel.eu, yeah.
[00:42:21.345 --> 00:42:25.028]  And we've got those up on screen for folks right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:42:25.348 --> 00:42:27.009]  And I know I'm jumping in a lot when Alan's on.
[00:42:27.029 --> 00:42:31.053]  I do that because everything he's saying is documented, and then I'm just backing it all up.
[00:42:31.073 --> 00:42:37.477]  But I want to come back and talk about ways to counter this, ways to defeat this, because we are getting through to some of the Obamanoids.
[00:42:37.838 --> 00:42:39.999]  The Obama deception has been very, very effective at that.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.902]  Any of your ideas of breaking through their conditioning?
[00:42:43.442 --> 00:42:47.968]  And showing them how they're being classically brainwashed to carry this out.
[00:42:47.988 --> 00:42:50.191]  And then as everything gets worse, they say, it's your fault.
[00:42:50.491 --> 00:42:51.772]  You didn't do what Obama said.
[00:42:51.833 --> 00:42:53.194]  You made the bad things happen.
[00:42:53.455 --> 00:42:54.416]  This is sick, folks.
[00:42:54.436 --> 00:42:54.936]  Stay with us.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.824]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:43:01.443 --> 00:43:04.406]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:43:04.786 --> 00:43:08.189]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:14.755]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:43:15.135 --> 00:43:20.200]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:27.066]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:43:27.386 --> 00:43:28.266]  Need something more?
[00:43:28.466 --> 00:43:32.128]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[00:43:32.428 --> 00:43:40.471]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[00:43:40.711 --> 00:43:45.053]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[00:43:45.353 --> 00:43:48.935]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:43:48.995 --> 00:43:53.217]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:44:12.225 --> 00:44:18.408]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:18.808 --> 00:44:20.649]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:20.789 --> 00:44:23.210]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:34.235]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:34.856 --> 00:44:36.156]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:36.536 --> 00:44:37.897]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:38.388 --> 00:44:44.714]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:45.294 --> 00:44:53.081]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:53.561 --> 00:44:54.702]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:55.143 --> 00:44:56.324]  The people strike back.
[00:44:58.593 --> 00:44:59.474]  Spring is here.
[00:44:59.714 --> 00:45:00.515]  Growing season.
[00:45:00.675 --> 00:45:02.676]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:45:02.876 --> 00:45:04.297]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:05.258]  Think about it.
[00:45:05.578 --> 00:45:09.421]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:45:09.661 --> 00:45:13.144]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:45:13.404 --> 00:45:15.045]  The country is running out of food.
[00:45:15.306 --> 00:45:17.887]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:19.949]  At OrganicaSeed.com
[00:45:20.169 --> 00:45:20.930]  We're good to go!

[00:46:24.318 --> 00:46:27.381]  Look at this, it says Hillary the Movie now showing at Supreme Court.
[00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:32.085]  Months after its debut, Hillary the Movie faces nine of the nation's toughest critics at the Supreme Court.
[00:46:32.486 --> 00:46:40.833]  The Justice Review of the slashing documentary, financed by longtime critics of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, could bring more than just thumbs up or thumbs down.
[00:46:40.893 --> 00:46:46.478]  It may settle the question of whether the government can regulate a politically charged film as a campaign ad.
[00:46:47.299 --> 00:46:51.821]  And they go on to say the former Republican Congressional lady produced the Clinton movie.
[00:46:52.141 --> 00:46:55.843]  Another described Senator Barack Obama as an over-hyped media darling.
[00:46:56.083 --> 00:46:57.004]  Oh, is that allowed?
[00:46:57.024 --> 00:47:00.205]  He said that his films are about important moments in American politics.
[00:47:00.245 --> 00:47:04.167]  The outcome of this case will dictate how we're able to make films and educate people about them.
[00:47:04.628 --> 00:47:10.471]  At issue is the case being argued before justices tomorrow is the 90-minute anti-Clinton movie and television ads.
[00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:15.657]  Bossy wanted to air during 2008 primaries, advertising the film.
[00:47:15.677 --> 00:47:23.248]  So see, all the big money can spend $2 billion outside of the regular campaign money, and the fake global warming ads and all of it, that's okay.
[00:47:23.288 --> 00:47:26.933]  And they can run political ads to get Obama an army of supporters.
[00:47:27.748 --> 00:47:28.389]  That's okay.
[00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:31.672]  But see, they're going to selectively enforce and set the precedent.
[00:47:31.972 --> 00:47:35.195]  Bossy's group, the Conservative Citizens United, released the movie as the Clintons.
[00:47:36.076 --> 00:47:39.159]  A New York senator was competing with Obama for Democratic presidential nomination.
[00:47:39.179 --> 00:47:46.807]  The movie is unquestionably anti-Obama, featuring commentary from conservative pundits, some of whom specifically say Clinton was not fit to be commander-in-chief.
[00:47:46.867 --> 00:47:48.608]  Imagine America having free speech!
[00:47:49.429 --> 00:47:58.757]  One scene, which was used in the ad, has Dick Morris, a former advisor to Clinton, who is now a critic of the Clintons, saying the senator is a closest thing we have in America to a European socialist.
[00:47:59.257 --> 00:48:00.839]  The movie was shown in eight theaters.
[00:48:00.939 --> 00:48:01.579]  Oh my gosh.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:09.366]  And it goes, federal court said the ads would violate McCain's Feingold Law, the popular name for 2002 revisions of the nation's campaign finance law.
[00:48:09.566 --> 00:48:11.507]  And that law says basically no free speech.
[00:48:11.588 --> 00:48:13.309]  I can't say I'm pro-gun, that's political.
[00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:15.371]  I can't say I'm pro-border, that's political.
[00:48:15.931 --> 00:48:17.432]  Alan Watt, your comments on this.
[00:48:17.612 --> 00:48:21.413]  And the AP reports it like, oh, it's reasonable.
[00:48:21.473 --> 00:48:23.334]  This is unquestionably anti-Clinton.
[00:48:23.654 --> 00:48:24.895]  Maybe this shouldn't be allowed.
[00:48:24.975 --> 00:48:27.616]  I mean, this is outrageous that they're even proposing this.
[00:48:29.336 --> 00:48:30.397]  Again, it falls right in.
[00:48:30.437 --> 00:48:36.219]  They want to get the message out there to the public to just be a good little citizen and be quiet.
[00:48:37.103 --> 00:48:46.529]  And leave everything to government and government agencies, have no opinion, and definitely don't try to encroach upon what they see as their territory now.
[00:48:47.009 --> 00:48:49.871]  They'll give the propaganda, no one else can give propaganda.
[00:48:50.851 --> 00:48:54.153]  That's happening too, to John Anthony Hill in Ireland.
[00:48:54.193 --> 00:48:58.396]  He was a guy who did 7-7 ripple effect above the bombings.
[00:48:58.996 --> 00:49:05.460]  And he used clips all through from regular television, BBC and so on, strung it all together, asked the right questions,
[00:49:05.987 --> 00:49:17.722]  But he did apparently, at least he's accused of sending out the videos to the judge and the jury, and he's up on basically terrorism charges to be extradited from Ireland for making that movie basically.
[00:49:18.503 --> 00:49:23.410]  And is to be taken off to Westminster, which is the terrorism court for Europe basically at the moment.
[00:49:24.168 --> 00:49:26.990]  And so they're getting the message out in all the countries now.
[00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.152]  You just can't go ahead and do this kind of stuff on your own.
[00:49:30.212 --> 00:49:31.893]  Don't interfere on our territory.
[00:49:31.933 --> 00:49:33.033]  This is our territory.
[00:49:33.634 --> 00:49:36.696]  You will be put in the slammer for life, and that's the charge against them.
[00:49:36.856 --> 00:49:44.640]  Hey, we've had the FBI calling this office asking us questions concerning how we put out the Obama deception and things.
[00:49:44.681 --> 00:49:46.902]  I mean, they are really trying to intimidate right now.
[00:49:47.262 --> 00:49:47.982]  Yes, they are.
[00:49:48.043 --> 00:49:51.965]  They're going to make sure that eventually, and they will make examples of different people
[00:49:52.839 --> 00:49:59.608]  And as I see this one in Ireland, if this goes through, that he's attempting to pervert the course of justice is the charge.
[00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:01.551]  He faces life in prison.
[00:50:01.611 --> 00:50:01.811]  Life.
[00:50:02.112 --> 00:50:02.232]  Yeah.
[00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:20.158]  And it's an excellent film, 7-7 Ripple Effect, folks, documenting, because he has the newscast where they killed the patsies, these supposed bombers who they hired for an anti-terror drill, which they admit they were running, and bombing the exact same trains and buses at the exact same time.
[00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:24.601]  Very effective film, and boy, he's on his way to life in prison right now.
[00:50:26.061 --> 00:50:27.722]  Just unbelievable ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:27.762 --> 00:50:29.162]  Alan Watt back in 70 seconds.
[00:50:29.202 --> 00:50:32.864]  I want to continue going over the news with you and taking phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:32.884 --> 00:50:33.244]  Stay with us.
[00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:34.884]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:47.759 --> 00:50:49.301]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:54.068]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:54.208 --> 00:50:56.932]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:57.152 --> 00:51:00.036]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:00.216 --> 00:51:04.923]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:05.143 --> 00:51:06.064]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:06.284 --> 00:51:09.266]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:09.526 --> 00:51:16.412]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:16.512 --> 00:51:19.654]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:19.794 --> 00:51:19.974]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[00:51:36.942 --> 00:51:38.723]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:50.515 --> 00:51:52.461]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:52.922 --> 00:51:55.691]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:03.314 --> 00:52:04.635]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[00:52:04.655 --> 00:52:09.377]  He's been nice enough to agree, I believe, Wednesday night to come on for a couple hours with Jason Burmess.
[00:52:09.397 --> 00:52:12.059]  That'll be a different style of interview, and they'll be taking calls as well then.
[00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:13.439]  We have an hour left.
[00:52:13.659 --> 00:52:17.361]  Alan, I've tried a lot of articles and topics I wanted you to comment on.
[00:52:17.381 --> 00:52:20.903]  I want to get into the global economic meltdown, where that's going.
[00:52:20.943 --> 00:52:22.564]  But first, solutions.
[00:52:23.965 --> 00:52:27.467]  Studying the enemy's programming, how they brainwash, how they condition the public.
[00:52:28.624 --> 00:52:29.725]  How do we reach out to them?
[00:52:29.745 --> 00:52:35.210]  Because you're right, there's a blitzkrieg motion as they hit us with all their world government operations.
[00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:39.774]  They've built up, they've prepared militarily, psychologically, economically.
[00:52:39.834 --> 00:52:43.517]  Now, at one time, they're launching at every level.
[00:52:43.557 --> 00:52:46.080]  Past the National Draft Friday, about to pass the Senate.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.741]  I mean, again, I shouldn't be talking about nothing but that.
[00:52:47.761 --> 00:52:49.603]  But we're being hit from every angle.
[00:52:51.649 --> 00:52:52.690]  And I see a lot of tactics.
[00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:54.750]  You know, they're still doing a lot of this covertly.
[00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:59.052]  You know, it's public, but they're not giving any attention to other things they're admitting to.
[00:52:59.432 --> 00:53:00.813]  How do we reach out to people?
[00:53:01.153 --> 00:53:03.393]  How do we get the people to rally against this now?
[00:53:05.154 --> 00:53:07.135]  It's a hard thing.
[00:53:08.075 --> 00:53:17.819]  Tibor Zinski and others that are masters of studying masses, the masses as they call it, human psychology, know that
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:30.927]  And he said in his own book, Between Two Ages, he said, most of the public shortly will be unable to think or reason for themselves, though they expect the mainstream media to do it for them.
[00:53:31.467 --> 00:53:32.447]  That's our problem.
[00:53:33.268 --> 00:53:37.610]  Our generation's grown up and they truly believe everything that's given to them on television.
[00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:44.194]  If it's not been on television and you bring up the topic, even if you have the evidence in front of you, they'll dismiss it.
[00:53:44.835 --> 00:53:49.797]  So, we're dealing with psychological warfare and its impact and its effects.
[00:53:50.977 --> 00:53:57.299]  Most people, unfortunately, as I say, won't react until it hits them personally at their doorstep, or on their doorstep.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:10.364]  The Constitution was the only thing, really, that gave you any protection, that you could at least say, hey, look here, you've got to change this or throw it out legally before you can come in with a new system.
[00:54:11.224 --> 00:54:14.245]  And they've effectively bypassed that and basically ignored it.
[00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:17.963]  The public never know what they have until they lose it, unfortunately.
[00:54:18.683 --> 00:54:22.345]  And if they're not willing to stand up for something now, they never will.
[00:54:22.545 --> 00:54:27.047]  You can't stand up for something when you're in prison camps behind barbed wire.
[00:54:27.067 --> 00:54:28.068]  You've had it by then.
[00:54:28.868 --> 00:54:31.869]  And remember, they're talking about a hundred years war.
[00:54:31.889 --> 00:54:33.850]  That was said right after 9-11.
[00:54:34.911 --> 00:54:36.652]  This is going to be a hundred years war.
[00:54:36.972 --> 00:54:38.092]  And that was never explained.
[00:54:38.132 --> 00:54:41.254]  These little phrases come out, but it's never explained to the general public.
[00:54:42.239 --> 00:54:49.824]  They expect to achieve their whole goal of eugenics, depopulation, the totally controlled society, etc.
[00:54:50.044 --> 00:54:54.186]  to be over and completed and done with in a hundred years.
[00:54:54.227 --> 00:54:55.687]  But it's been a hundred years war.
[00:54:56.128 --> 00:55:01.291]  And I said years ago, after 9-11 happened, I said, this is a war, remember?
[00:55:01.311 --> 00:55:06.114]  They declared a war, which means you're going to have ration cards, scarcity of food,
[00:55:06.927 --> 00:55:13.633]  Um, to be in control of the economic system like all wars are, they'll have conscription, etc, etc, etc.
[00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:23.962]  And notice, I gotta stop you, hold the thought, now in England, the U.S., in California, they shut off the three big water supplies for different fish and things they claim are endangered.
[00:55:24.422 --> 00:55:26.824]  Suddenly, they have to ration water in England.
[00:55:27.185 --> 00:55:34.451]  The head of the operation in the London Telegraph this weekend said, we're gonna ration water, not just carbon footprint, but water footprint.
[00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.252]  I mean, it's all happening!
[00:56:02.884 --> 00:56:12.690]  Yes, and they can come into your house now in Britain, and go through your refrigerator, and advise you how to cook, how much to store, and what you're wasting, and so on.
[00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:13.610]  This is how bad it is.
[00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:14.791]  And that's coming here, too.
[00:56:15.611 --> 00:56:18.653]  Yeah, that was in the news this weekend, and they announce it like it's good!
[00:56:19.033 --> 00:56:19.394]  That's right.
[00:56:19.614 --> 00:56:20.974]  And the bill in the U.S.
[00:56:21.014 --> 00:56:30.360]  to do with agriculture, etc., will affect the home gardener, and there's a clause in there, too, it says, and all food preparation facilities, that includes your kitchen, folks.
[00:56:31.184 --> 00:56:35.466]  Oh no, in fact they've had committee hearings, and the bill says everything.
[00:56:35.867 --> 00:56:44.892]  A tomato plant folks, they say they will use SWAT teams, and notice they're already beta testing SWAT teaming people selling eggs on the road, selling watermelons.
[00:56:45.292 --> 00:56:46.753]  I mean, that's what Stalin did.
[00:56:46.793 --> 00:56:49.574]  Stay there Alan, let's continue with what their real agenda is.
[00:56:49.654 --> 00:56:51.015]  And folks, phone calls coming up, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:56:51.035 --> 00:56:52.876]  My websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:56:58.197 --> 00:57:03.881]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:57:04.142 --> 00:57:08.925]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:57:09.185 --> 00:57:14.149]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:17.752]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:57:18.272 --> 00:57:26.456]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:57:26.796 --> 00:57:32.179]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:57:32.599 --> 00:57:38.342]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:57:38.582 --> 00:57:40.623]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:57:40.663 --> 00:57:42.424]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:58:01.542 --> 00:58:03.666]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:04.167 --> 00:58:11.219]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:11.736 --> 00:58:17.939]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:20.160]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.721]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:22.801 --> 00:58:33.726]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:34.367 --> 00:58:35.667]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:36.047 --> 00:58:37.408]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:44.238]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:58:53.088 --> 00:58:54.230]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:55.852]  The people strike back.
[00:58:58.112 --> 00:59:01.496]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:59:01.616 --> 00:59:06.842]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:59:07.042 --> 00:59:11.728]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:23.333]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:29.235]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:59:29.476 --> 00:59:35.538]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:36.398]  What about you?

[00:59:58.098 --> 01:00:03.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.801]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:05.821 --> 01:00:16.886]  You know, Michael Savage came out two weeks ago and said that he believes Obama's controllers will stage Reichstag terror attacks in the United States to bring in martial law.
[01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:19.127]  That's a big deal.
[01:00:20.495 --> 01:00:31.805]  I was picking some food up last night on the way home and ran into two folks there at the bar where I was getting the food who were listeners of this show and Savage and they they had heard that and that really really shocked them.
[01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:37.469]  We have the Army Zone manuals where they teach army captains how to stage terror attacks.
[01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:41.513]  I mean this is as much a part of their daily operation as
[01:00:44.821 --> 01:00:45.142]  Anything.
[01:00:45.383 --> 01:00:47.971]  I mean, as their canteen, as their M16.
[01:00:48.773 --> 01:00:49.977]  Remember, the Global is stage 9-11.
[01:00:51.752 --> 01:00:53.853]  And they killed 1,300,000 Iraqis.
[01:00:54.774 --> 01:00:58.697]  Brzezinski in two books, one he published last year, brags that the U.S.
[01:00:58.817 --> 01:01:03.940]  funded the Khmer Rouge in Pol Pot that killed 35% of their population, 3 million people.
[01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:06.502]  They don't care about you either.
[01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:07.303]  You understand that?
[01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:13.527]  Your little world, my little world, having things that are nice, having liberty, being treated with respect by the government, it's all over.
[01:01:13.547 --> 01:01:15.708]  They're not doing the slow socialist move anymore.
[01:01:15.969 --> 01:01:19.131]  That was to get us domesticated, to get us bankrupt, to get us under their control.
[01:01:19.151 --> 01:01:20.612]  They're moving with the hot war now.
[01:01:21.513 --> 01:01:25.706]  And so instead of the amount of changes you'd see in 30, 40 years, you'll now see in a year.
[01:01:28.288 --> 01:01:36.374]  They're making their big move, folks, and they're going to take your pension funds, everything you've got, millions will end up serving them and being their minions for a paltry sum.
[01:01:37.555 --> 01:01:41.638]  This is like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or Mao Zedong's China.
[01:01:42.158 --> 01:01:49.984]  In fact, if you really study what Obama's doing, it's more akin to the refining of the Stalinist era with the Maoist era.
[01:01:50.505 --> 01:01:52.446]  And that's what he's setting up, these youth brigades.
[01:01:52.486 --> 01:01:53.787]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:01:53.807 --> 01:01:57.490]  They passed the draft, which is an expansive draft,
[01:01:58.545 --> 01:02:05.408]  Making middle school students work for the feds, high school, 18-24 serving in a new domestic military that will also be deployed overseas.
[01:02:07.568 --> 01:02:11.270]  And these idiots signing up for Obama's system, they don't know they're about to be conscripted.
[01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:15.031]  But he's also going to have his separate, outside the government army.
[01:02:16.712 --> 01:02:20.853]  And, Alan Watt, I mean, you brought up the fact that they're accelerating everything right now.
[01:02:20.893 --> 01:02:21.874]  This is a blitzkrieg.
[01:02:23.197 --> 01:02:24.698]  I want that to really sink into listeners.
[01:02:24.718 --> 01:02:29.959]  Can you speak to that more and then get into the type of plant society, shutting down the gardens, everything you talked about?
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:31.820]  Yes.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:40.242]  In fact, it was a politician in Holland that a couple of years ago said that this new order basically is like a big ship in a rough sea.
[01:02:40.883 --> 01:02:45.184]  And every country is on board with this direction of the ship.
[01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:50.674]  And all kinds, all kinds of countries from third world to first world countries are all on board the ship.
[01:02:51.215 --> 01:02:57.682]  And whereas before, the third world countries were down below decks, now everybody's on top of the deck, mixed together.
[01:02:58.243 --> 01:03:01.526]  And the captains of the ship have to keep on course with where they're going.
[01:03:02.047 --> 01:03:05.491]  This is the terminology that's used with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:03:06.297 --> 01:03:09.842]  We understand that it was set up with the goal of bringing in world government.
[01:03:10.322 --> 01:03:18.673]  And in their mandate, in their charter, they basically say that they're going to bring in a world where everyone will serve the World State Service.
[01:03:19.372 --> 01:03:20.313]  Service, service.
[01:03:20.813 --> 01:03:28.577]  And gradually, through the warfare and all the rest of it, they're introducing service, perpetual, lifelong service to this world state.
[01:03:28.998 --> 01:03:33.020]  That will be your purpose for living, in fact, will be to serve the world state.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.902]  And that's why they're going ahead now with this.
[01:03:36.382 --> 01:03:48.409]  They will grab many people who have been outspoken about this, to make examples of them, to make sure the rest of them get it, to give them incredible sentences to make sure it terrifies everyone, just as it did in the Soviet Union.
[01:03:49.009 --> 01:03:50.630]  And we can't allow that to happen.
[01:03:50.650 --> 01:04:07.481]  We've got to speak up now, because once it's happening, once they start raiding your streets and grabbing your neighbours and hauling them off in front of the whole street, to turn out the whole street to witness it, you'll end up like the Soviets, where you'll be ashamed of yourself, because secretly you're glad they took your neighbours and not yourself.
[01:04:08.342 --> 01:04:11.704]  That's the state you end up being in, under fear and tyranny.
[01:04:12.064 --> 01:04:14.025]  And we cannot allow this to happen.
[01:04:14.085 --> 01:04:16.467]  It must not even start to happen.
[01:04:19.127 --> 01:04:20.148]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:04:20.168 --> 01:04:28.676]  You know, I'm just looking at Infowars.com headlines and it says, Department of Homeland Security investigating large ammunition purchases.
[01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:31.598]  So now Homeland Security was supposedly going to fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:04:32.379 --> 01:04:34.901]  It is now looking at who's been ordering lots of ammo.
[01:04:34.921 --> 01:04:43.829]  So if you stockpile it or think it's a good investment to sell later, they're now saying that the owner of Namek's Sport Shop and Farm and Garden Center in
[01:04:44.790 --> 01:05:00.723]  Warrensburg said gun sales in his business began to increase and then it goes on to say that Homeland Security is there now trying to track who's buying ammo and then all over the country the feds are saying if you want your stimulus package money in your county you gotta pass a law to register people when they buy ammo.
[01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:13.814]  Then I have another article here from the Council on Foreign Relations where General James Jones, one of the heads of the National Security Council, says, I take my orders from Henry Kissinger, who's not even part of the government.
[01:05:14.174 --> 01:05:21.060]  Notice who was the Chief Advisor to the Vatican, Chief Advisor to Bush Sr., Chief Advisor to Clinton, Chief Advisor to Nixon.
[01:05:21.441 --> 01:05:27.706]  I mean, how can these Obama people think there's any difference when it's right out in the open that the same people are running the show?
[01:05:28.806 --> 01:05:29.607]  I know, and they are.
[01:05:30.689 --> 01:05:35.215]  Again, let's go back to the Council on Foreign Relations and what Professor Carl Quigley said.
[01:05:35.255 --> 01:05:43.267]  He said, the world is now run by technocrats, unelected people who are in contact with all the leaders, the elected leaders.
[01:05:44.133 --> 01:05:55.657]  And he said that these technocrats go behind the scenes, do all the real work, they have the real power, they're not responsible to the public, but they basically advise all the presidents and prime ministers what to do.
[01:05:56.237 --> 01:05:58.178]  And that's a fact, that's what we truly have.
[01:05:58.278 --> 01:06:04.280]  And I've got the same article with him saying that he gets his orders from Kissinger, you're quite right.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.641]  And that's from... And Brzezinski too, yeah.
[01:06:06.661 --> 01:06:10.122]  Yeah, that's from the Council on Foreign Relations bragging
[01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:13.533]  Just absolutely no change with Obama.
[01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:13.853]  Look at this.
[01:06:13.893 --> 01:06:16.835]  Department of Homeland Security investigating large ammunition purchases.
[01:06:17.836 --> 01:06:18.376]  Here's another one.
[01:06:18.436 --> 01:06:18.976]  Video.
[01:06:19.277 --> 01:06:21.118]  Obama supporters go door-to-door.
[01:06:21.618 --> 01:06:22.599]  Guys, pull that up.
[01:06:22.659 --> 01:06:28.123]  It's the third story that comes up in the little news box right there.
[01:06:29.664 --> 01:06:30.244]  Here's another one.
[01:06:30.384 --> 01:06:34.187]  CERB death leader squad commander, CIA operative.
[01:06:35.688 --> 01:06:38.270]  Man, I tell you, this is just... And he worked for 20 years.
[01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:40.572]  He was the top double agent for 20 years, yeah?
[01:06:42.879 --> 01:06:45.141]  Absolutely, and when they were ready to betray him, they did.
[01:06:45.181 --> 01:06:46.141]  That's all these people do.
[01:06:49.864 --> 01:06:50.705]  This is incredible.
[01:06:52.186 --> 01:06:52.926]  Continue, Alan.
[01:06:54.107 --> 01:06:57.630]  I always tell young people, regardless of the ethnic background that you're in,
[01:06:58.311 --> 01:07:03.599]  Don't join groups that are advocating violence because you're being set up as patsies.
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:09.048]  They've got to now bring forth terrorism, maybe on a continual basis.
[01:07:09.508 --> 01:07:12.954]  We're so used to hearing something getting blown up this week or next week or whatever.
[01:07:13.644 --> 01:07:14.484]  I don't think so.
[01:07:30.151 --> 01:07:31.612]  This is out of the post star.
[01:07:32.212 --> 01:07:35.053]  They're now saying you may be a terrorist if you buy a bunch of ammo.
[01:07:35.073 --> 01:07:37.274]  So again, they're scared of folks buying lots of ammo.
[01:07:37.535 --> 01:07:42.497]  So they're saying, OK, we're going to put you on terror list if you do this as an attempt at a chilling effect.
[01:07:42.617 --> 01:07:43.557]  I don't see this working.
[01:07:43.818 --> 01:07:45.878]  I see this accelerating gun and ammo sales.
[01:07:46.879 --> 01:07:47.719]  It probably will.
[01:07:47.839 --> 01:07:48.480]  It probably will.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.142]  If people have the sense not to be intimidated, you either keep your way of living
[01:07:54.111 --> 01:07:54.892]  Or you give it up.
[01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:55.952]  It's as simple as that.
[01:07:56.012 --> 01:07:58.454]  You keep your way of living or give it up and comply.
[01:07:58.734 --> 01:08:00.396]  And if you comply, you're defeated.
[01:08:00.836 --> 01:08:02.217]  I was about to say exactly.
[01:08:02.257 --> 01:08:03.458]  If you comply, you're defeated.
[01:08:03.518 --> 01:08:04.999]  I was about to echo that.
[01:08:05.619 --> 01:08:07.020]  We must say no.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.262]  We're not doing anything wrong protesting the Federal Reserve.
[01:08:09.282 --> 01:08:11.303]  We're not doing anything wrong buying lots of ammo.
[01:08:11.744 --> 01:08:12.704]  You are the criminals.
[01:08:12.744 --> 01:08:15.846]  I mean, the criminals don't want us armed, Alan.
[01:08:15.866 --> 01:08:16.227]  Go ahead.
[01:08:16.727 --> 01:08:25.773]  Well, that's obvious, but it's been stated many times over the past that have to disarm the American people to fulfill their agenda.
[01:08:26.454 --> 01:08:27.615]  And that is true.
[01:08:27.635 --> 01:08:37.721]  I mean, even if the people are not organized, as I say, towards the end, if this goes ahead and steamrolls ahead, you are going to see famine because five agribusinesses control all the food.
[01:08:38.102 --> 01:08:39.843]  They won't allow you to grow your own.
[01:08:40.527 --> 01:08:40.927]  Listen to this!
[01:09:00.891 --> 01:09:05.895]  One northern Warren County resident found out recently the government is paying attention to such ammo sales.
[01:09:06.535 --> 01:09:11.919]  Wes said a customer of his recently stocked up on .223 caliber rounds, a caliber often used in assault weapons.
[01:09:12.859 --> 01:09:18.123]  The customer brought 1,000 rounds of ammo, I've done that, a few months ago through a mail order company.
[01:09:18.183 --> 01:09:20.245]  Shortly after the purchase, he received a visit from the U.S.
[01:09:20.265 --> 01:09:26.069]  Department of Homeland Security, whose interest was apparently connected by a large sale purchase of the caliber.
[01:09:26.469 --> 01:09:27.330]  His wife was home,
[01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:31.912]  He was at church, people are buying a lot of ammo, and so they just throw that in there.
[01:09:32.632 --> 01:09:32.853]  Mm-hmm.
[01:09:33.553 --> 01:09:33.933]  That's right.
[01:09:34.693 --> 01:09:40.837]  So what was normal at one time, I know a lot of guys in the States would go out to the ranges there and just blast off a whole case at times.
[01:09:41.437 --> 01:09:44.098]  Spend the whole day at a... Well, that's how you buy them cheaper!
[01:09:44.158 --> 01:09:45.359]  That's how you buy them cheaper, yeah.
[01:09:45.839 --> 01:09:46.219]  That's right.
[01:09:46.539 --> 01:09:49.241]  And so again, that was their usual way of living.
[01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:54.043]  And they want you to change it all, to suit them for what's coming down the pike.
[01:09:54.083 --> 01:09:55.084]  That's so obvious, yeah.
[01:09:55.564 --> 01:09:59.786]  Well, I mean, they've built this giant homeland security apparatus, took it over, said the Congress runs nothing.
[01:10:00.026 --> 01:10:03.508]  The Federal Reserve goes on TV and Congress says, we run everything, you can't question us.
[01:10:03.728 --> 01:10:07.189]  They openly announced their tyranny in plain view, like it's no big deal to set the precedent.
[01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:12.812]  And then they announced the army, the police, homeland security, we're watching gun owners, we're watching all of you, you're terrorists.
[01:10:13.012 --> 01:10:15.233]  And they tell the cops, these gun owners want to kill you.
[01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:16.694]  I mean, that's in the MIAC report.
[01:10:16.894 --> 01:10:18.655]  These gun owners want to murder officers.
[01:10:19.366 --> 01:10:26.510]  And then they're going to send the cops out for the guns and they're going to get killed, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and the cops won't think, well, why is this happening to me?
[01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:35.414]  That's correct, but unfortunately, too, I've got a generation growing up playing video games who want to wear those black uniforms and they want to go and kill people.
[01:10:36.154 --> 01:10:38.315]  I mean, these people really do exist.
[01:10:38.356 --> 01:10:41.177]  They're brainwashed to be gung-ho killers.
[01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:44.578]  And so, this has been a long-term preparation.
[01:10:44.598 --> 01:10:45.499]  We've got to understand that.
[01:10:45.519 --> 01:10:48.981]  This isn't just happening now, and it's all disassociated.
[01:10:49.421 --> 01:10:51.002]  This has been long-term planning.
[01:10:51.222 --> 01:11:00.047]  That's why they created one generation to grow up, be in their twenties, join the black-clad outfit guys and ninjas, and they're lusting for blood.
[01:11:00.087 --> 01:11:03.749]  It's like getting to take part in a real video game and really kill people.
[01:11:04.169 --> 01:11:05.410]  That's high on their agenda.
[01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:09.912]  Well, I've found the main programming TV show is G.I.
[01:11:09.972 --> 01:11:10.232]  Joe.
[01:11:10.272 --> 01:11:12.473]  In fact, I think I sent a clip this weekend to the network.
[01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:19.918]  John, do you have the clip where Cobra Commander is explaining that they've created a worldwide economic collapse to bring in the New World Order?
[01:11:20.418 --> 01:11:22.079]  Do you have that clip I sent over the weekend?
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.761]  Yeah, we're going to come back and play that.
[01:11:25.821 --> 01:11:32.265]  And then, guys, did you go find the CNN report showing the Obama people knocking on people's doors, telling them to join the Obama Nation?
[01:11:33.666 --> 01:11:35.807]  That's the third story at Infowars.com.
[01:11:35.827 --> 01:11:36.748]  We need to get that ready.
[01:11:36.768 --> 01:11:41.110]  I'm going to play a clip of that, or we can just play the video in the background as we talk with Alan Watt.
[01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:46.033]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to start going to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:11:46.053 --> 01:11:47.374]  I could just talk to Alan Watt forever.
[01:11:47.414 --> 01:11:50.956]  This guy is 100% spot on, and he's a great colleague to work with.
[01:11:51.016 --> 01:11:51.917]  I really appreciate him.
[01:11:52.297 --> 01:11:54.378]  Cut into the matrix.com is the website.
[01:11:54.398 --> 01:11:54.818]  Stay with us.
[01:11:58.072 --> 01:12:01.334]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:12:01.514 --> 01:12:05.595]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:12:05.775 --> 01:12:13.719]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:12:14.019 --> 01:12:17.200]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:23.302]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:12:23.542 --> 01:12:27.923]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:12:28.223 --> 01:12:36.225]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:12:36.405 --> 01:12:43.247]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare and
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:46.961]  We're good to go.
[01:13:04.498 --> 01:13:09.821]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:10.361 --> 01:13:16.564]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:16.864 --> 01:13:18.685]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:18.825 --> 01:13:21.226]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:21.286 --> 01:13:32.192]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.761]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:36.141 --> 01:13:37.542]  It's about a one world government.
[01:13:38.002 --> 01:13:44.305]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:44.905 --> 01:13:52.689]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:53.169 --> 01:13:54.330]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:55.931]  The people strike back.
[01:13:58.086 --> 01:13:59.988]  Good day, Jim Newcover from Midas Resources.
[01:14:00.209 --> 01:14:00.449]  March 23rd, 2009.
[01:14:00.489 --> 01:14:01.490]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5050.
[01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:05.134]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7767, $4.8884 for the half ounce, and $2.4442 for a quarter ounce.
[01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:05.555]  That's $9.7767, $4.8884, or $2.4442.
[01:14:17.003 --> 01:14:20.604]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:14:20.664 --> 01:14:23.705]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:14:23.785 --> 01:14:32.947]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:14:33.267 --> 01:14:38.588]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:14:39.068 --> 01:14:41.390]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:43.893]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:14:44.293 --> 01:14:46.375]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:14:47.656 --> 01:14:51.380]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:51.720]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:51.920]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:14:57.884 --> 01:14:59.145]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:14:59.185 --> 01:15:04.547]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:15:04.787 --> 01:15:09.409]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:15:09.789 --> 01:15:14.871]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:20.073]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:15:20.593 --> 01:15:22.474]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:27.505]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:15:27.705 --> 01:15:28.606]  And here's the best part.
[01:15:28.826 --> 01:15:31.608]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:15:31.908 --> 01:15:35.211]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:15:35.511 --> 01:15:38.353]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:15:38.714 --> 01:15:40.595]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:15:40.915 --> 01:15:41.856]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:15:41.876 --> 01:15:42.256]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:15:42.277 --> 01:15:43.177]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:54.235]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:15:54.555 --> 01:15:56.996]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:16:00.257 --> 01:16:02.357]  There's too much news to cover, folks.
[01:16:02.497 --> 01:16:09.659]  I may do 15-20 minutes of overdrive and see if Alan Watt will do that with us today on PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars streams.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.861]  Because it looks like we're going to have the Department of the Army come on the show.
[01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:22.120]  We've called four numbers, gotten a bunch of other numbers, and we've gotten a colonel who says in 15 minutes he may come on.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.422]  Alan will be on with us for that.
[01:16:23.903 --> 01:16:28.730]  Dealing with the secret army police, watching myself and others at the end of the Fed demonstration in Dallas.
[01:16:31.266 --> 01:16:35.088]  This just in, the UK population must fall to 30 million, says Porritt.
[01:16:35.748 --> 01:16:41.270]  Jonathan Porritt of Gordon Brown's Leading Green Advisors is to warn that Britain must drastically reduce its population.
[01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:44.752]  It doesn't matter if the British population only has 1.5 children.
[01:16:44.772 --> 01:16:46.712]  For every two people, they don't even replace them.
[01:16:47.513 --> 01:16:49.154]  The average in Europe's 1.3.
[01:16:49.294 --> 01:16:50.814]  Europe's dying, Japan's dying.
[01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:54.716]  The population's going to plane off at 8 billion, the third world's still exploding.
[01:16:55.116 --> 01:16:56.136]  This is the eugenicist.
[01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:57.097]  Times of London.
[01:16:58.243 --> 01:17:00.025]  There you go right there, my friend.
[01:17:00.045 --> 01:17:09.552]  They say they're bringing in big government so they can basically, with water rationing and food rationing, make people so poor they can't afford to have children and a one-child policy.
[01:17:09.632 --> 01:17:10.113]  Alan, what?
[01:17:11.734 --> 01:17:23.924]  That was gone through by Charles Galton Darwin in the fifties when he published his book, The Next Million Years, on behalf, and by the way, he has a society still going, a eugenic society.
[01:17:23.944 --> 01:17:26.046]  They call themselves the British Eugenic Society.
[01:17:26.784 --> 01:17:40.293]  Initially they said we can tempt them to go up to the material goods so we'll have an age of plenty, but eventually you said that would be too hard on resources so they'd have to do it the other way around and basically, as you say, bring them into poverty.
[01:17:40.693 --> 01:17:42.134]  This was planned 50 years ago.
[01:17:42.474 --> 01:17:43.495]  Now that's a cut of 50%!
[01:17:43.615 --> 01:17:43.775]  Yes.
[01:17:47.031 --> 01:17:48.312]  And it won't stop there, mind you.
[01:17:48.332 --> 01:17:50.393]  That's just to get the ball rolling.
[01:17:50.533 --> 01:17:53.914]  Because they want to really bring down the population of the planet.
[01:17:54.535 --> 01:17:55.875]  Almost 90%, really.
[01:17:56.196 --> 01:17:57.696]  Yeah, I've always seen their documents.
[01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:59.957]  For the public, they always say 50%.
[01:18:00.898 --> 01:18:02.739]  In their mainline documents, they say 80%.
[01:18:04.019 --> 01:18:08.602]  And then in their internal documents that we've gotten, they say 99% of us will be exterminated.
[01:18:09.262 --> 01:18:09.642]  That's right.
[01:18:09.982 --> 01:18:13.224]  And plus, you have the military think tanks for Britain.
[01:18:13.892 --> 01:18:14.533]  And the U.S.
[01:18:14.613 --> 01:18:22.143]  both on board with the depopulation agenda, so they have eugenics in the military's teachings at the higher level.
[01:18:22.937 --> 01:18:24.597]  So this is a must-be on their behalf.
[01:18:25.318 --> 01:18:27.318]  There's nothing happenstance about it.
[01:18:27.858 --> 01:18:28.778]  It's all related.
[01:18:28.858 --> 01:18:33.960]  It's all... What we have is a pyramid with a capstone running the whole kit and caboodle underneath it.
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:34.800]  That's what we have.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.661]  And that's why they give the troops the delayed cancer virus injections that kill them by age 55 to 60.
[01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:41.781]  That's even come out in documents.
[01:18:41.821 --> 01:18:43.722]  And the higher-ups say, well, we've got to kill the troops.
[01:18:44.122 --> 01:18:45.942]  You know, we don't have to pay for them when they get old.
[01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:48.903]  This is the socialist model.
[01:18:49.623 --> 01:18:51.084]  And now they've just got us conditioned.
[01:18:51.124 --> 01:18:54.667]  Yeah, HPV shots killing people and the bird flu vaccines killing people.
[01:18:55.087 --> 01:18:56.528]  And they just get us kind of normalized.
[01:18:56.568 --> 01:18:59.571]  Well, yeah, we make you take the shot and then you die or get paralyzed.
[01:18:59.611 --> 01:19:01.973]  And it's kind of like, you're not an extremist, are you?
[01:19:02.053 --> 01:19:03.253]  Take the shot and die.
[01:19:03.294 --> 01:19:03.914]  We love you.
[01:19:03.974 --> 01:19:04.795]  It's for your safety.
[01:19:05.175 --> 01:19:08.958]  I mean, again, it's just total normalization of insanity.
[01:19:09.893 --> 01:19:10.193]  It is.
[01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:11.293]  That's how it works.
[01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:12.754]  It's insidious to begin with.
[01:19:12.994 --> 01:19:13.754]  It's long-term.
[01:19:13.854 --> 01:19:14.994]  A lot is done in secret.
[01:19:15.635 --> 01:19:22.937]  The sterilization of males has been going on in the Western world for 50 years, and all the medical societies now come out and admit it.
[01:19:23.037 --> 01:19:27.098]  They've known this for 50... It suddenly started about 50 years ago, suddenly.
[01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:28.002]  Yeah.
[01:19:46.818 --> 01:19:48.919]  There's hundreds of different combos of cheap plastic.
[01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:53.822]  They chose the one formula 60 years ago for universal adoption.
[01:19:53.842 --> 01:19:58.364]  The one type that leaches the exact estrogen mimicker that sterilizes men.
[01:19:59.345 --> 01:20:05.528]  And they also made sure that all baby formulas were rinsed, sterilized supposedly with the same formula.
[01:20:05.929 --> 01:20:07.509]  So they hit them right at birth, yeah.
[01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:13.533]  And then we expose it's killing the kids in thousands, mainstream news, and they say, we decided melamine's good for babies.
[01:20:14.488 --> 01:20:18.589]  Yes, and it was put out by the Melamine Society that works with the European Union.
[01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:22.850]  Every study they put out comes from the society that owns the companies that put it in the foot.
[01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:26.130]  So, you wonder why you're dying of cancer?
[01:20:26.170 --> 01:20:27.651]  Why your kids are sterile or retarded?
[01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:29.371]  And you just still love the government.
[01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:31.052]  You'll line up at your Obama Brigades.
[01:20:31.272 --> 01:20:32.592]  Let's play this Cobra Commander clip.
[01:20:32.612 --> 01:20:33.432]  I'm just going to play the audio.
[01:20:33.472 --> 01:20:37.833]  We have the video, but here is Cobra Commander, and then we'll come back and play a clip of the CNN and go to your calls.
[01:20:38.073 --> 01:20:38.453]  Here it is.
[01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:42.374]  John, go ahead and play the Cobra Commander, please.
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:45.961]  Attention, citizens!
[01:20:47.081 --> 01:21:00.665]  Due to the financial irresponsibility and incompetence of your leaders, Cobra has found it necessary to restructure your nation's economy.
[01:21:01.385 --> 01:21:08.307]  We have begun by eliminating the worthless green paper which your government has disused.
[01:21:09.428 --> 01:21:11.368]  It is valuable.
[01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:13.589]  Cobra will come to
[01:21:18.677 --> 01:21:23.881]  It is in the United States.
[01:21:24.422 --> 01:21:29.045]  I am pleased to announce Cobra's economic recovery plan.
[01:21:29.786 --> 01:21:39.553]  If you want money to buy food for your children, take all your valuables to the nearest branch of extensive enterprises.
[01:21:40.333 --> 01:21:44.857]  There, all goods will be exchanged for Cobra Curry!
[01:21:48.146 --> 01:21:51.129]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:54.893]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.196 --> 01:21:59.378]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:21:59.558 --> 01:22:05.984]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:22:06.125 --> 01:22:08.487]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't
[01:22:13.435 --> 01:22:22.059]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:22:22.279 --> 01:22:28.422]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:22:28.663 --> 01:22:32.064]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[01:22:32.264 --> 01:22:36.407]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:22:43.268 --> 01:22:46.430]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:51.532]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:23:11.701 --> 01:23:17.908]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:18.288 --> 01:23:20.130]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:22.693]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:22.773 --> 01:23:33.725]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:34.349 --> 01:23:35.630]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.412]  It's about a one world government.
[01:23:37.872 --> 01:23:44.217]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:23:44.778 --> 01:23:52.564]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:53.045 --> 01:23:54.205]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:54.626 --> 01:23:55.807]  The people strike back.
[01:23:58.035 --> 01:23:58.915]  Detoxify.
[01:23:58.975 --> 01:24:03.457]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[01:24:03.577 --> 01:24:09.338]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[01:24:09.558 --> 01:24:13.339]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective Keelermax.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:18.421]  With the help of Nutriodyne, Keelermax will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins, and chemicals.
[01:24:18.581 --> 01:24:24.146]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins and fluoride, bromine and chloride.
[01:24:24.286 --> 01:24:28.230]  Add Malignabla to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:32.894]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[01:24:33.094 --> 01:24:39.620]  And Nutratrala to recycle all fat and water-soluble antioxidant cellular protection enzymes and molecules.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.982]  Keeler Maxx and Dr. Bill's Oral Detox.
[01:24:42.222 --> 01:24:42.403]  I'm good.
[01:25:00.478 --> 01:25:02.459]  I've been busy working behind the scenes.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:04.421]  I forgot to ask Alan one during the break.
[01:25:04.441 --> 01:25:05.602]  I'll put him on the spot here on air.
[01:25:05.622 --> 01:25:06.162]  I know he's busy.
[01:25:06.182 --> 01:25:06.622]  He can't do it.
[01:25:06.662 --> 01:25:07.483]  That's fine.
[01:25:07.583 --> 01:25:14.368]  Alan, can you go into overdrive so we have time to take calls and cover other issues 20 minutes into the next hour, or do you need to leave us at the end of this hour?
[01:25:14.388 --> 01:25:15.489]  No, I can go on.
[01:25:15.509 --> 01:25:17.410]  All right, you're just awesome.
[01:25:17.831 --> 01:25:19.071]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com.
[01:25:19.131 --> 01:25:20.472]  Our site's InfoWars.com.
[01:25:20.833 --> 01:25:22.054]  Okay, this is why we're busy.
[01:25:23.183 --> 01:25:25.725]  I sent the numbers to John Harmon to the military.
[01:25:25.745 --> 01:25:30.988]  I wasn't clear during the break before last and I said, we're going to call this guy live on air.
[01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:32.809]  The message got mixed up.
[01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:37.833]  So John, because we've been calling all day and they've been refusing to come on or giving us other numbers.
[01:25:38.293 --> 01:25:46.779]  John Harmon got a hold of them, brought up the army document saying basically, you know, that they had to watch the in the Fed Ron Paul demonstrators as potential terrorists.
[01:25:47.339 --> 01:25:48.820]  And he confirmed the document.
[01:25:49.501 --> 01:25:52.663]  Also, Rob Deuce talked to him, but they don't want to talk about it on air.
[01:25:53.443 --> 01:25:54.884]  Uh, but there it is confirmed.
[01:25:54.924 --> 01:25:56.064]  John Harmon, I want to bring you up.
[01:25:56.104 --> 01:25:57.084]  You talked to this guy.
[01:25:58.165 --> 01:25:59.305]  Let's just go ahead and give his name out.
[01:25:59.345 --> 01:26:01.646]  It's Scott Ferguson, Department of Public Affairs, U.S.
[01:26:01.706 --> 01:26:01.966]  Army.
[01:26:01.986 --> 01:26:03.727]  Uh, he's a civilian.
[01:26:03.747 --> 01:26:05.207]  We talked to a colonel earlier, too.
[01:26:05.247 --> 01:26:06.287]  John, what did he say to you?
[01:26:06.988 --> 01:26:11.489]  Well, basically, I talked to him about 15 minutes ago, and he was really arrogant-sounding.
[01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:13.350]  Just did not want to come on air.
[01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:15.150]  Didn't know anything.
[01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:16.771]  You know, didn't want to talk politics.
[01:26:17.766 --> 01:26:22.627]  Was just really short with me, and I said, well, you know, could I call you back in about 15 minutes, see if you could come on?
[01:26:22.847 --> 01:26:24.288]  Yep, sounds fine.
[01:26:24.688 --> 01:26:25.948]  Called him back, no answer.
[01:26:26.408 --> 01:26:27.208]  Now he's not answering.
[01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:30.409]  Now, I was talking to you and Rob Due during the break.
[01:26:30.649 --> 01:26:36.010]  One of you said that you did talk to him and a colonel, specifically, it was Rob Due, actually.
[01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:40.011]  Did you bring up the Army report to him and say that was what it was about?
[01:26:40.952 --> 01:26:46.353]  No, I just asked him, hey, we would like someone associated with what you do and get your opinion on what's going on.
[01:26:47.011 --> 01:26:49.392]  He was just still kind of like, oh, I don't know.
[01:26:49.612 --> 01:26:50.372]  That's not what we do.
[01:26:50.412 --> 01:26:51.753]  You know this is the Army, right?
[01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:52.653]  I was like, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:53.693 --> 01:26:59.296]  Yeah, well, Dew did bring up the report, and they said the same thing about politics.
[01:26:59.356 --> 01:27:02.717]  So we'll continue to track this as it develops.
[01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:04.677]  But just getting crazy.
[01:27:06.443 --> 01:27:13.785]  I had sent to the network this weekend, because I'm still in the mindset of not doing video, just doing audio, to play the clip for me this week of G.I.
[01:27:13.845 --> 01:27:14.205]  Joe.
[01:27:15.285 --> 01:27:22.166]  In the 80s, I was kind of at the end of watching cartoons, you know, as a teenager by the early 80s, but I remember when G.I.
[01:27:22.186 --> 01:27:27.567]  Joe first came on in about 82, and this is from one of the early episodes, that was all New World Order propaganda.
[01:27:28.227 --> 01:27:34.029]  And since then I'll go and watch online, and others are doing it too, old Cobra Commander, you know, episodes of G.I.
[01:27:34.069 --> 01:27:35.109]  Joe, and it's all
[01:27:37.082 --> 01:27:50.149]  Basically throwing the New World Order in your face in every episode, like the TV's mind-controlling people, but Cobra Commander's doing it, and it's got to be stopped, and it admits the wavelength of the video, mesmerizes you, which Sign of It reports admit.
[01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:57.453]  In this one, he's for gold coins, and he's manipulated the market to crash the world economy and to sell everybody gold.
[01:27:58.073 --> 01:27:58.733]  And he's bad.
[01:27:58.793 --> 01:28:03.716]  Gold is bad, cash is good, and he holds up a gold coin and goes, ah, Cobra money!
[01:28:04.136 --> 01:28:08.080]  So let's play this clip and then get Alan Watts' expert take on it and we'll go right to your calls.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.022]  Tonight, video of the Obamanoids beating on doors.
[01:28:11.103 --> 01:28:11.823]  Join us!
[01:28:11.883 --> 01:28:12.584]  Join us!
[01:28:13.004 --> 01:28:14.406]  Pledge to support the bankers!
[01:28:14.526 --> 01:28:15.046]  Literally!
[01:28:15.747 --> 01:28:18.189]  So this is pure fascism slash communism.
[01:28:18.469 --> 01:28:21.052]  But here is the Cobra Commander clip.
[01:28:21.172 --> 01:28:23.034]  Guys, we're going to play the singing in next.
[01:28:23.054 --> 01:28:24.315]  Can you pull me up the Cobra Commander?
[01:28:24.795 --> 01:28:25.656]  Okay, go ahead and play it.
[01:28:25.676 --> 01:28:26.096]  Here it is.
[01:28:26.717 --> 01:28:28.579]  Attention citizens!
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:43.071]  Due to the financial irresponsibility and incompetence of your leaders, Cobra has found it necessary to restructure your nation's economy.
[01:28:43.912 --> 01:28:53.900]  We have begun by eliminating the worthless green paper, which your government has distilled into history, is valuable.
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.722]  Cobra will come to your rescue.
[01:29:06.141 --> 01:29:16.464]  I am pleased to announce Cobra's economic recovery plan.
[01:29:17.184 --> 01:29:26.907]  If you want money to buy food for your children, take all your valuables to the nearest branch of extensive enterprises.
[01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:34.114]  There, all goods will be exchanged for Cobra Currency!
[01:29:34.134 --> 01:29:35.335]  Ah, gold money!
[01:29:36.236 --> 01:29:41.060]  So see... Oh, it's just amazing programming.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:44.163]  If you want gold, you're the person destroying the economy.
[01:29:44.704 --> 01:29:45.745]  You're Cobra Commander.
[01:29:45.765 --> 01:29:46.385]  Alan Watt.
[01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:48.747]  Yeah, I believe in the name.
[01:29:48.787 --> 01:29:51.450]  That means that the snake system isn't the serpent system.
[01:29:52.139 --> 01:29:54.420]  So even that was tucked in there, too.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.721]  But all these cartoons, really, it's even worse today.
[01:29:58.741 --> 01:30:06.124]  If you were watching the cartoons for children, it's full of programming and messages of what's to come.
[01:30:06.704 --> 01:30:15.087]  And again, we've got to realize that the big boys wrote about this extensively in the 40s, 50s, 60s, all through, that they'd use all media.
[01:30:16.191 --> 01:30:17.452]  To get their message across.
[01:30:17.552 --> 01:30:27.260]  By the way, Fox News has now put out a 10 minute promo piece admitting they're planting pro-global warming eugenics ads in all their TV shows and media.
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:28.481]  So this is now admitted.
[01:30:28.861 --> 01:30:31.403]  Explain to people what predictive programming is.
[01:30:32.464 --> 01:30:43.933]  Predictive programming is a technique developed and perfected at Tavistock Institutes in London on behalf of the British oligarchy that always has run Britain.
[01:30:44.554 --> 01:30:46.197]  And the idea is very simple.
[01:30:46.678 --> 01:30:55.394]  It's through fiction, through the works of fiction, where you're getting crossed in a story and the male will identify with the hero, the woman with the heroine.
[01:30:57.407 --> 01:31:09.293]  And once you're hooked in emotional stories, generally bad guys on the run from the good guys who go after them with overwhelming force, they then tuck in the prediction of what's to come.
[01:31:09.673 --> 01:31:15.556]  You'll see things still to come, like cops smashing down doors, no warrants, all that kind of stuff will be in the story.
[01:31:15.876 --> 01:31:20.358]  And you won't mind because this guy they're after is the worst mass murderer, pedophile
[01:31:20.638 --> 01:31:21.578]  You can ever imagine.
[01:31:21.598 --> 01:31:27.881]  And therefore, you accept all the things you're seeing where the law itself is disregarded to get this bad guy.
[01:31:28.261 --> 01:31:33.044]  Therefore, when it happens in real life, you're familiar with the idea and you ask no questions.
[01:31:33.104 --> 01:31:41.207]  It seems quite natural to you to see it happen in real life just the same way it was in the fictional movies or television drama series.
[01:31:41.728 --> 01:31:43.668]  They're using them now to full force.
[01:31:44.029 --> 01:31:49.331]  Every country has its anti-terrorism dramas, ongoing dramas.
[01:31:50.232 --> 01:31:59.821]  Britain has them, Canada even has one, where they send off jets to the border, to the bridges, to guard against terrorism, and it's a tremendous threat to avoid.
[01:31:59.921 --> 01:32:08.009]  And in the show, Spooks in England and all these shows here, they torture people's children to get answers, and that stops the nuke from going off, so torturing children's good.
[01:32:08.269 --> 01:32:11.833]  Then it comes out in the media, they are torturing people's children for fake confessions.
[01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:13.674]  All of it.
[01:32:14.455 --> 01:32:15.237]  Getting everybody ready.
[01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:20.209]  All these new movies about you take the vaccine and it actually kills you, like I Am Legend.
[01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:24.378]  So then when we also talk about it, they say, oh you got that from a movie.
[01:32:25.225 --> 01:32:26.005]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:26.085 --> 01:32:30.367]  Or people who watch the movies and enjoy the series will say, well, so what?
[01:32:30.587 --> 01:32:32.547]  Because they've already been programmed.
[01:32:32.567 --> 01:32:35.428]  They have been programmed that this is all quite normal to them.
[01:32:35.708 --> 01:32:37.969]  Well, take NYPD, Blue, and all these other shows.
[01:32:38.029 --> 01:32:41.630]  Every episode, the cops beat somebody, but the guy's always guilty.
[01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:42.610]  It was right to do it.
[01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.531]  Exactly.
[01:32:43.651 --> 01:32:45.091]  Mask conditioning, masks.
[01:32:45.191 --> 01:32:51.113]  Because as mammals, we accept what we see on TV as the way we're supposed to behave as pack creatures.
[01:32:51.713 --> 01:32:53.494]  Very, very serious, folks.
[01:32:54.135 --> 01:32:55.816]  Let's go ahead and play the new G.I.
[01:32:55.836 --> 01:32:56.096]  Joe.
[01:32:56.136 --> 01:32:57.417]  Everybody join the military.
[01:32:57.457 --> 01:32:58.357]  It's an army unit.
[01:32:58.597 --> 01:33:00.619]  You get to be a superhero if you have it.
[01:33:01.339 --> 01:33:03.801]  And again, you're fighting the Wicked Cobra.
[01:33:04.161 --> 01:33:05.262]  So, here it is.
[01:33:08.363 --> 01:33:12.586]  When I'm finished, the world will never forget.
[01:33:16.428 --> 01:33:17.009]  Make the call.
[01:33:19.059 --> 01:33:20.540]  Technically, we don't exist.
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.541]  We answer to no one.
[01:33:24.262 --> 01:33:27.743]  And when all else fails, we don't.
[01:33:28.023 --> 01:33:29.424]  What did you say your unit was called?
[01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:31.285]  I didn't.
[01:33:35.907 --> 01:33:37.868]  GI Joe The Rise of Cobra.
[01:33:38.922 --> 01:33:47.109]  Now, in real life, the Special Combat Applications Group, Delta Force and others run around dealing drugs, killing people, buying off local governments, overthrowing governments, taking over the U.S.
[01:33:47.129 --> 01:33:49.611]  But here, they're heroes fighting the evil terrorist.
[01:33:53.334 --> 01:33:55.076]  Alan Watt, I don't think it's working anymore, though.
[01:33:56.595 --> 01:33:57.415]  No, it's not.
[01:33:57.475 --> 01:34:02.917]  So there are people who have caught on to it and have been aware for a few years, because it has got rather blatant.
[01:34:03.557 --> 01:34:08.158]  People who haven't watched television for a few years and suddenly switch it on, you wonder which world you're in.
[01:34:08.718 --> 01:34:11.339]  Because you see the programming very easily.
[01:34:11.759 --> 01:34:13.859]  Very easily if you've been away from television for a while.
[01:34:14.199 --> 01:34:17.860]  Those who continuously watch television, they don't notice the changes at all.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:18.661]  That's right.
[01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:19.901]  And they don't really care.
[01:34:19.941 --> 01:34:21.981]  They'll say, well, the police have to do this.
[01:34:22.181 --> 01:34:24.402]  Well, they're saying that because they watch the dramas.
[01:34:25.082 --> 01:34:33.509]  If you don't watch a lot of TV, you miss all the little sub-downloads slowly changing your view, and then it's very disjointed, and you're like, whoa!
[01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:37.752]  So I guess the first step is stop watching mainstream television.
[01:34:38.373 --> 01:34:39.113]  I want to go to calls.
[01:34:39.133 --> 01:34:40.374]  I'm going to play this CNN clip.
[01:34:40.394 --> 01:34:44.898]  We're going to do 20 minutes of overdrive only at PrisonPlanet.tv and TheInfoWars.com.
[01:34:44.918 --> 01:34:47.820]  Stream's coming up at the end of the show in a T-minus 18 minutes.
[01:34:48.201 --> 01:34:49.522]  Right now, Mark in Oregon.
[01:34:49.542 --> 01:34:50.542]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[01:34:50.583 --> 01:34:50.903]  Go ahead.
[01:34:53.251 --> 01:34:53.991]  Sorry about that.
[01:34:54.572 --> 01:34:56.753]  Well, thank you.
[01:34:56.793 --> 01:34:57.634]  Thank you very much.
[01:34:57.954 --> 01:34:59.275]  Great to speak with you and Alan.
[01:35:00.515 --> 01:35:03.557]  Alan, I'd like to get your opinion on something.
[01:35:03.577 --> 01:35:13.163]  I have an idea that I feel could be very effective in this struggle of humanity against the coming tyranny here, and as the tyranny currently exists.
[01:35:14.263 --> 01:35:14.944]  I like Alex.
[01:35:14.984 --> 01:35:17.786]  I really respect your intelligence and your heart, Alan.
[01:35:17.826 --> 01:35:18.986]  That's why I'm asking you this.
[01:35:19.026 --> 01:35:21.107]  It'll take me about one minute to go over it.
[01:35:22.621 --> 01:35:24.662]  And, uh... Turn the radio off, too.
[01:35:25.143 --> 01:35:26.644]  Yeah, do me a big favor and turn the radio off.
[01:35:27.144 --> 01:35:28.085]  My radio is off.
[01:35:28.305 --> 01:35:29.726]  Okay, well, I'm getting that code, but go ahead.
[01:35:30.466 --> 01:35:30.906]  Okay.
[01:35:31.827 --> 01:35:49.879]  Uh, Alan, the only and by far the most powerful weapon, which is readily available, uh, as we speak, to deal in a very, to deal a very substantial blow to the enemy's progress here, and its implementation of world tyranny, is a weapon of publicity.
[01:35:51.195 --> 01:36:20.614]  And the logical vehicle, as well as the only vehicle available to spread on a global basis not only the urgency of the very short time that the world's people have until they will all be under total and complete tyranny, but also to achieve the ultimate projection of the facts of truth of the Infowar, is the combination of Alex's celebrity, of fusing as such, of the world celebrity of Alex Jones,
[01:36:21.474 --> 01:36:24.536]  Into a globally effective vehicle of publicity.
[01:36:24.556 --> 01:36:26.036]  Alright, let me just stop you for a minute.
[01:36:26.156 --> 01:36:28.077]  I am not that big, okay?
[01:36:28.097 --> 01:36:30.839]  And I don't want to be some big giant leader that's very dangerous.
[01:36:31.039 --> 01:36:36.541]  The reason we have power on this show is we have great activists, listeners, who are great leaders in their own right.
[01:36:37.402 --> 01:36:41.544]  People are always thinking, I can do this magic bullet, that magic bullet, I can barely get the trash taken out around here.
[01:36:42.044 --> 01:36:44.385]  So, uh, but finish up your point because I want to get to everybody else.
[01:36:44.705 --> 01:36:50.068]  But you, as you said, you know, you are the globally recognized leader of this freedom movement.
[01:36:50.717 --> 01:36:55.241]  And I only see one available and viable vehicle, and that is a movie.
[01:36:55.821 --> 01:36:58.844]  It'd be about the 14 years of your radio life, Alex.
[01:36:59.464 --> 01:37:07.191]  It could be made with the assistance of the many and varied producers, directors, and actors whom you know personally and who admire you.
[01:37:08.111 --> 01:37:14.837]  And it would, I believe, assist in the production, the financing, and the acting parts.
[01:37:15.461 --> 01:37:16.623]  With you playing yourself?
[01:37:16.843 --> 01:37:18.745]  Not when people threaten to kill their children.
[01:37:18.765 --> 01:37:22.971]  We've already tried to put out another film and they threatened to kill people's children, so they pulled out.
[01:37:23.311 --> 01:37:24.753]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:37:25.834 --> 01:37:29.879]  They can defeat anything that is based on one move, okay?
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:35.023]  But we have to be like a hundred headed Hydra, but not just that, you know, a hundred hundred headed Hydras.
[01:37:35.383 --> 01:37:37.865]  And that's why I bring Alan Watt and others to try to build them up.
[01:37:38.406 --> 01:37:39.907]  And, you know, and he's doing that in his own right.
[01:37:39.947 --> 01:37:44.730]  So I, I don't agree on this, you know, single move thing or trying to produce a film.
[01:37:44.770 --> 01:37:46.051]  They just then wouldn't distribute it.
[01:37:46.752 --> 01:37:47.852]  You want to explain that to people, Alan?
[01:37:48.813 --> 01:37:49.854]  Yes, true as well.
[01:37:50.675 --> 01:37:55.398]  You have to understand as well that everyone out there has to fight for their own life, basically, and for their children.
[01:37:56.321 --> 01:38:01.224]  And it's too easy to one way or another, legally or otherwise, get rid of someone at the top.
[01:38:01.644 --> 01:38:05.226]  And when you're gone, the one who's leading you is over.
[01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:08.869]  You're like bureaucrats without the leader at the top.
[01:38:09.369 --> 01:38:10.069]  It's the same thing.
[01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:11.710]  So you've got to be your own champion.
[01:38:12.271 --> 01:38:13.711]  And you have to do the legwork.
[01:38:13.851 --> 01:38:15.392]  You have to go out and be vocal.
[01:38:16.133 --> 01:38:17.213]  Everyone's involved here.
[01:38:17.354 --> 01:38:18.274]  Everyone is involved.
[01:38:18.294 --> 01:38:19.975]  We've got to stop looking for champions.
[01:38:20.255 --> 01:38:21.476]  You are your own champion.
[01:38:21.616 --> 01:38:27.619]  Well, that's one of the biggest forms of programming is the Arnold Schwarzenegger, or whoever the archetypal Hercules archetype.
[01:38:27.899 --> 01:38:38.104]  He goes out and slays the dragons for you, and then people constantly think, no, no, no, the reason we're successful here is we're getting the people to go out and mobilize, and then it's a thousand heads.
[01:38:38.444 --> 01:38:42.145]  They have no way of stopping us that way if it's an idea.
[01:38:42.506 --> 01:38:47.168]  I'm not bulletproof, Alan Watts not bulletproof, but ideas are bulletproof.
[01:38:47.828 --> 01:38:48.889]  That's correct, and also
[01:38:50.748 --> 01:39:00.135]  We're going to realize as well that anyone can be threatened or got to one way or another, or blackmailed, or your family threatened or something.
[01:39:00.776 --> 01:39:05.179]  So when you have one leader of a personality cult, that's why they've been in the movies.
[01:39:05.359 --> 01:39:07.781]  So many movies I've had for the 20 years.
[01:39:08.402 --> 01:39:08.822]  The One.
[01:39:09.102 --> 01:39:10.323]  The One is coming to help.
[01:39:10.343 --> 01:39:10.843]  That's right.
[01:39:10.863 --> 01:39:11.744]  The Savior.
[01:39:11.944 --> 01:39:12.825]  The Army of One.
[01:39:13.105 --> 01:39:13.786]  One person.
[01:39:13.806 --> 01:39:14.706]  It's Obama.
[01:39:14.746 --> 01:39:15.287]  It's whoever.
[01:39:15.387 --> 01:39:16.388]  They've got to save you.
[01:39:16.428 --> 01:39:18.629]  It's always about making you feel inadequate.
[01:39:18.850 --> 01:39:20.411]  That's what Madison Avenue is all about.
[01:39:20.851 --> 01:39:21.311]  Exactly.
[01:39:21.611 --> 01:39:24.093]  And people have to realize, no, you are your own champion.
[01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:28.735]  Your own family depends on what you do and everyone else around you as well.
[01:39:29.656 --> 01:39:30.957]  So everyone is involved in this.
[01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:37.333]  No one of us who talk on radio can stop it all happening for you.
[01:39:37.613 --> 01:39:42.877]  We can certainly try and impede it and get the word out, but it's up to you to do your own part in it.
[01:39:42.897 --> 01:39:44.218]  Yeah, and I mean, it's part of it.
[01:39:44.258 --> 01:39:53.384]  Sure, if they made a film about getting started, you know, being threatened by the military, Bohemian Grove, all the stuff we've been through, you know, all the things we've broken and covered, that would be interesting.
[01:39:53.424 --> 01:39:55.385]  That would only be one part of the solution.
[01:39:55.805 --> 01:39:58.707]  You know, again, it's a movement of liberty and awakening.
[01:39:58.727 --> 01:39:59.648]  But thank you, Mark.
[01:40:00.068 --> 01:40:00.888]  I appreciate your support.
[01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:02.109]  I'm not poo-pooing your idea.
[01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:04.291]  I'm just bringing more perspective to it.
[01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:05.671]  Steve in Chicago.
[01:40:05.751 --> 01:40:06.652]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:40:07.533 --> 01:40:20.141]  Alex, I hate to say this, but I think Allen Watt and the Watson Brothers are an MI6 spy nest, and they've poisoned your mind subliminally and subconsciously with anger and culture.
[01:40:20.181 --> 01:40:21.342]  Let me explain something to you, sir.
[01:40:21.922 --> 01:40:22.502]  That's funny.
[01:40:24.207 --> 01:40:26.528]  Alan Watt and the Watson Brothers are not related.
[01:40:28.388 --> 01:40:35.710]  Paul Watson was running a tiny website and had never been contacted by me, and I called up and said, would you like to do webmaster work for me?
[01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:38.731]  And I'm going to start a website called PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:40:39.251 --> 01:40:40.871]  So, let's get one thing straight.
[01:40:41.331 --> 01:40:42.071]  It works like this.
[01:40:42.231 --> 01:40:44.232]  I call Paul Watson up and tell him what I want done.
[01:40:44.572 --> 01:40:45.832]  We're friends, but that's it.
[01:40:45.892 --> 01:40:47.373]  I talk to Paul about twice a week.
[01:40:48.073 --> 01:40:49.793]  There's one person running things in this office.
[01:40:49.833 --> 01:40:50.333]  It's me.
[01:40:50.853 --> 01:40:51.093]  Me.
[01:40:51.374 --> 01:40:52.234]  There's no handlers.
[01:40:52.254 --> 01:40:52.854]  There's none of that.
[01:40:53.354 --> 01:40:54.575]  And the same thing with Alan Watt.
[01:40:54.935 --> 01:40:55.336]  I mean, why?
[01:40:55.356 --> 01:40:56.656]  Because they got British accents?
[01:40:56.676 --> 01:40:57.477]  They must be bad?
[01:40:57.497 --> 01:40:58.778]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[01:40:59.298 --> 01:41:00.559]  Well, that's the point.
[01:41:00.739 --> 01:41:03.001]  You know, the situation is this.
[01:41:03.401 --> 01:41:04.642]  All this Anglican culture.
[01:41:04.722 --> 01:41:08.645]  We got Roger Kipling and the white man's burden, which must be observed.
[01:41:09.085 --> 01:41:09.786]  Un-Germanic.
[01:41:10.146 --> 01:41:13.529]  We have the Sir Thomas More utopianism.
[01:41:13.809 --> 01:41:14.469]  Un-Germanic.
[01:41:14.549 --> 01:41:15.390]  Must be observed.
[01:41:16.171 --> 01:41:17.552]  We have the angry young men.
[01:41:17.612 --> 01:41:19.553]  Social injustices to minorities.
[01:41:20.206 --> 01:41:23.109]  Sir, I gotta let you go.
[01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:24.229]  This is too insane.
[01:41:24.370 --> 01:41:30.114]  I mean, Alan Watt exposes Rudger Kipling as pushing the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:41:30.715 --> 01:41:32.756]  Alan, you know, it's just crazy.
[01:41:32.796 --> 01:41:38.101]  We're trying to mobilize people to a national draft that passed the House Friday, and they don't want to discuss that.
[01:41:38.501 --> 01:41:39.302]  It's all about us.
[01:41:39.362 --> 01:41:42.004]  You see how they're obsessed with us because we're the supposed leaders?
[01:41:42.955 --> 01:41:43.296]  That's right.
[01:41:43.456 --> 01:41:47.682]  There are people who are in their little tunnels and you'll never change their minds on anything.
[01:41:47.702 --> 01:41:48.122]  They're stuck.
[01:41:48.283 --> 01:41:52.769]  They like where they are and they've decided that's all they need to know and that's it.
[01:41:52.809 --> 01:41:54.451]  They're closed to anything further.
[01:41:55.672 --> 01:42:03.435]  I mean, does it matter if I talk to a member of the Japanese Diet exposing 9-11 as an inside job, or if I interview the former German Defense Minister, or I interview Alan Watt?
[01:42:03.455 --> 01:42:07.396]  I mean, most Americans don't even have passports and don't travel anywhere.
[01:42:07.416 --> 01:42:13.578]  I mean, it's now I'm evil because you've got a British accent, Alan, when all you do is expose the British Empire.
[01:42:13.598 --> 01:42:16.899]  This is the height of just one-dimensional thinking.
[01:42:17.339 --> 01:42:19.440]  See, Obama must be good because he's black, see?
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.621]  But you must be bad because you've got a British accent.
[01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:23.557]  That's right.
[01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:24.338]  That's right.
[01:42:24.638 --> 01:42:31.141]  And some people, too, still think I am the Alan Watts that was lecturing back in the 20s and 30s.
[01:42:31.201 --> 01:42:32.862]  I'd have to be about 90 if I was him.
[01:42:33.082 --> 01:42:36.984]  Well, that's how this thing that I'm some Catholic assassin, I'm not even Catholic, started.
[01:42:37.264 --> 01:42:42.287]  Because there was a black guy named Alex Jones, and people said, why are you writing this, Alex?
[01:42:42.387 --> 01:42:44.968]  And I said, that's not me, and I didn't respond to him.
[01:42:45.248 --> 01:42:54.487]  So they said, that's it, he's the guy, and it never ended, and it's this huge cottage industry, and they just all believe it, and I've seen that, that you're some guy named Alan Watt who died 50 years ago.
[01:42:54.527 --> 01:42:55.710]  Yeah, we'll be right back.
[01:42:58.032 --> 01:43:00.273]  Worried about the side effects from prescription drugs?
[01:43:00.454 --> 01:43:04.116]  Tired of searching for an effective, safe, natural alternative you can trust?

[01:43:49.002 --> 01:43:51.823]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:04.651 --> 01:44:09.995]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:10.535 --> 01:44:16.719]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:17.019 --> 01:44:18.840]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.382]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:44:21.462 --> 01:44:32.349]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.881]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:36.302 --> 01:44:37.703]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:38.164 --> 01:44:44.511]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:45.071 --> 01:44:52.859]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.481]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:54.922 --> 01:44:56.103]  The people strike back.
[01:44:57.725 --> 01:45:01.588]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[01:45:01.908 --> 01:45:05.210]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:08.952]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[01:45:09.373 --> 01:45:11.674]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.
[01:45:27.845 --> 01:45:28.245]  That's right.
[01:46:02.787 --> 01:46:08.897]  Okay, all the callers that are on hold... Abby, Ken, Nick, and...
[01:46:13.015 --> 01:46:16.277]  Brent, I want you to call this number right now because we're going to take 20 minutes of calls.
[01:46:16.297 --> 01:46:21.779]  We're going to Overdrive at PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com streams.
[01:46:21.799 --> 01:46:22.339]  You need to go there.
[01:46:22.359 --> 01:46:23.440]  It won't be on the AM and FM.
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.341]  We'll do 20 minutes of Overdrive with Alan Watt.
[01:46:25.681 --> 01:46:26.841]  The number for you to call is 888-201-2244.
[01:46:26.861 --> 01:46:26.961]  888-201-2244.
[01:46:26.981 --> 01:46:27.021]  888-201-2244.
[01:46:27.061 --> 01:46:31.163]  And they'll go to the head of the line, those folks that are holding Abby Kent, Nick and Brent.
[01:46:40.304 --> 01:46:50.874]  I've got a few things I want to plug here, and I want to play a little bit of the clip of CNN with them going door-to-door with their brainwashing, but before I do that, some of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[01:46:51.374 --> 01:46:55.658]  One of them is the Cola Blue, the atmospheric water generator, amazing system, seven and a half gallons a day.
[01:46:56.058 --> 01:46:57.019]  We have one right here in the office.
[01:46:57.059 --> 01:46:57.680]  I have one at home.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:58.140]  I love it.
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:02.685]  And it goes through seven filters including reverse osmosis inside a fabulous system.
[01:47:02.825 --> 01:47:04.286]  Ecoloblue.com.
[01:47:04.306 --> 01:47:06.088]  Ecoloblue.com or give them a call at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:47:06.108 --> 01:47:06.328]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:47:06.348 --> 01:47:06.629]  Ecoloblue.com.
[01:47:13.175 --> 01:47:14.756]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[01:47:14.796 --> 01:47:20.417]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:47:20.757 --> 01:47:26.239]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds had a higher value than even any other barter item like gold.
[01:47:26.819 --> 01:47:29.340]  There's a war on against hybrid seeds and non-GMO seeds.
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:32.021]  They're buying them up, putting them in the UN, a seed vault.
[01:47:32.041 --> 01:47:33.781]  You can Google that and read BBC about it.
[01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:39.743]  Solutions from science are trying to get the seeds out of the globalist hands, into the hands of the people, one survival seed bank at a time.
[01:47:40.603 --> 01:47:46.126]  Their website is survivalseedbank.com, survivalseedbank.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:47:46.166 --> 01:47:51.369]  Again, that number, 877-327-0365, survivalseedbank.com.
[01:47:51.409 --> 01:47:56.932]  And lastly, also from Solutions and Science, mysolarbackup.com, mysolarbackup.com.
[01:47:56.952 --> 01:48:01.175]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power during hurricanes, snow, ice storms, and other things.
[01:48:01.215 --> 01:48:04.877]  Listeners should be moving towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[01:48:05.257 --> 01:48:08.899]  A solar power generator is available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions for some Science.
[01:48:09.219 --> 01:48:15.463]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of power source 1800, power plant, and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:48:16.223 --> 01:48:20.466]  Remember too that gas generators won't be working because they'll need gas if we go into this crisis.
[01:48:20.766 --> 01:48:22.086]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:48:22.106 --> 01:48:22.687]  Get off the grid.
[01:48:22.707 --> 01:48:22.747]  877-327-0365.
[01:48:22.767 --> 01:48:22.807]  877-327-0365.
[01:48:22.827 --> 01:48:23.367]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:48:30.728 --> 01:48:40.253]  We are posting up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next 20 minutes the best free copy we found on YouTube or anywhere on the web of the Obama deception.
[01:48:40.613 --> 01:48:42.734]  And I want you to make it go mega viral again.
[01:48:42.774 --> 01:48:43.754]  They've been censoring it.
[01:48:44.074 --> 01:48:45.315]  We can't allow this to happen.
[01:48:45.395 --> 01:48:47.156]  Help us get it out to everybody.
[01:48:47.596 --> 01:48:48.336]  I made the film.
[01:48:48.436 --> 01:48:48.817]  It's free.
[01:48:48.857 --> 01:48:51.178]  You can order the high quality DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:51.198 --> 01:48:51.858]  Please support us.
[01:48:52.218 --> 01:48:57.601]  Or get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and watch the PrisonPlanet.tv show and get all my films in high quality and burn them to disk.
[01:48:58.021 --> 01:48:59.562]  It's got DivX, all of it made easy.
[01:48:59.882 --> 01:49:03.484]  But the big deal is they've censored this thing off the main page at YouTube and Google.
[01:49:03.905 --> 01:49:04.485]  We've caught them.
[01:49:04.665 --> 01:49:06.786]  Please, this article's going out in the next few minutes.
[01:49:07.327 --> 01:49:10.409]  Get it out to everybody at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:10.769 --> 01:49:19.754]  Alan Watt, in closing, we're going to come back and take calls after this one-minute break, but I wanted to ask you about the psychological system of... I've noticed they've also programmed people where they can... it's like Crimestop.
[01:49:19.794 --> 01:49:23.957]  They can't ever focus on the issue or documents of FEMA camps or real things.
[01:49:24.257 --> 01:49:27.299]  They always go into weird conspiratorial subterfuge
[01:49:28.715 --> 01:49:28.855]  Yes.
[01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:30.856]  Tremendous psychology involved in all of this.
[01:49:30.916 --> 01:49:34.857]  And the whole world is run under psychology and the guys that make all the dramas on television.
[01:49:53.462 --> 01:49:55.507]  Other instructions from top psychologists.
[01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:59.516]  And it's even altered for different ethnic peoples in different countries.
[01:49:59.556 --> 01:50:01.540]  The same programs, in fact, same scripts.
[01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:04.065]  So we're under tremendous warfare, yeah.
[01:50:06.241 --> 01:50:07.081]  Absolutely, Alan.
[01:50:07.101 --> 01:50:08.802]  Let's flesh that out more.
[01:50:09.342 --> 01:50:12.163]  We got you on a new line so that we can continue over in our studio.
[01:50:12.203 --> 01:50:12.843]  It's a little bit low.
[01:50:12.863 --> 01:50:13.643]  We're going to boost that.
[01:50:14.023 --> 01:50:24.747]  We're going to come back and recap all that with Alan Watt going into overdrive and your phone calls coming up at the toll-free number that I just gave out a few minutes ago.
[01:50:24.787 --> 01:50:25.367]  Again, I want to thank
[01:50:25.367 --> 01:50:26.227]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:26.247 --> 01:50:27.428]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:47.776 --> 01:50:49.337]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:49.457 --> 01:50:54.039]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:54.199 --> 01:50:56.960]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:00.021]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:04.923]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:05.143 --> 01:51:06.064]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:06.284 --> 01:51:09.226]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:09.526 --> 01:51:16.410]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:16.530 --> 01:51:19.632]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:19.792 --> 01:51:21.673]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[01:51:24.935 --> 01:51:26.116]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:05.385 --> 01:52:06.006]  Yeah, we're good.
[01:52:21.004 --> 01:52:37.219]  DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:44.866]  As soon as you guys give me a updated phone list on that toll-free number we gave out, right before we ended the main radio show.
[01:52:44.906 --> 01:52:46.087]  I do this maybe once a month.
[01:52:46.107 --> 01:52:47.008]  We go into overdrive now.
[01:52:47.988 --> 01:52:55.234]  Going back to Alan Watt, finishing up the point you were making about, you know, we see people when they're told they have cancer, they get mad at the doctor.
[01:52:55.375 --> 01:53:05.143]  Or, you know, we bring them this message and then somehow about half the time of people fighting the New World Order, and if we can stop this, we would actually, you know, win and be able to defeat the globalists.
[01:53:05.163 --> 01:53:05.984]  We're already very close.
[01:53:06.684 --> 01:53:09.805]  It's obsessions on those of us that are standing up and speaking out.
[01:53:10.305 --> 01:53:16.147]  And I see great people like NuffRespect, who's had probably 40, 50 million.
[01:53:16.187 --> 01:53:18.408]  I mean, he's got videos with 10 million views apiece.
[01:53:19.349 --> 01:53:22.830]  And a couple years ago, you know, all his videos would get 2, 3, 4 million views.
[01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:28.232]  Suddenly they started restricting his views, and now his videos will say 5 million views, or from 5 million to 5,000.
[01:53:29.650 --> 01:53:30.090]  Yes.
[01:53:46.658 --> 01:54:03.085]  And so a lot of people that stick their head up to fight the New World Order get attacked by the pre-programmed mass of people, not just those that openly disagree with us and want the New World Order or say it doesn't exist, but by the bottom feeders and the government operatives and their camp followers that then attack anyone that sticks their head up.
[01:54:03.125 --> 01:54:10.249]  Kind of the crab syndrome where crabs in a bucket, if you've ever been fishing for crabs, will try to stop any other crab from crawling out instead of working together.
[01:54:11.329 --> 01:54:13.110]  I see that as the biggest thing to break.
[01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:29.803]  Yes, well I was reading a book quite a few years ago on how this would unfold in society and they said they would actually encourage those in what they called the fringe group.
[01:54:30.404 --> 01:54:35.428]  By that they meant those who are borderline, there's a lot of borderline psychotics.
[01:54:36.181 --> 01:54:37.663]  And they would encourage that group.
[01:54:37.723 --> 01:54:46.614]  In fact, they might even, especially on the internets, they can come into their sites and encourage the psychotic ones to attack personalities who are being effective.
[01:54:47.335 --> 01:54:50.519]  So that is actually underway right now on a big scale.
[01:54:51.344 --> 01:55:12.647]  I know that for a fact many people who go into the forums will tell you they'll start off fine and someone comes in they'll all like this person's got lots of information next thing you know he's got them all fighting each other or going off in a different tangent and or attacking someone who is effective the idea being that if you if you get up there and have a voice and then you're in
[01:55:13.287 --> 01:55:17.772]  Really altering the outlook of many people, then you must be one of them.
[01:55:18.172 --> 01:55:19.494]  That's the first thing they jump at.
[01:55:19.534 --> 01:55:21.236]  They don't think you can be genuine at all.
[01:55:21.916 --> 01:55:26.081]  It is true that in the past, agencies have put their own people in place.
[01:55:26.121 --> 01:55:30.005]  We know that with certain people who did the Patriot rounds in fact years ago.
[01:55:30.929 --> 01:55:35.053]  And it's admitted afterwards they were government operatives by themselves.
[01:55:36.474 --> 01:55:41.338]  So yeah, you can't trust everyone, but you don't attack everyone either who's getting the word out.
[01:55:41.878 --> 01:55:46.142]  And we're not advising you as to what to do except to protest.
[01:55:46.202 --> 01:55:47.163]  You can protest.
[01:55:47.203 --> 01:55:54.148]  That's the only right we have left at the moment is to protest what's happening in the world.
[01:55:54.609 --> 01:55:56.010]  We know what the next step would be.
[01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:57.351]  The other boys know it too.
[01:55:58.368 --> 01:56:05.414]  So all we can do is protest and say no and do the Gandhi thing and go along with that and just hope that that's enough.
[01:56:06.636 --> 01:56:07.777]  Well, absolutely, Alan.
[01:56:08.898 --> 01:56:09.898]  Getting an echo there, guys.
[01:56:10.419 --> 01:56:16.164]  We also see these formulas where what happens is
[01:56:17.873 --> 01:56:21.877]  Somebody will come on the scene, start a radio show or website for about a year, and they'll act normal.
[01:56:22.337 --> 01:56:23.398]  And they'll get credibility.
[01:56:24.339 --> 01:56:32.766]  And then suddenly they attack everybody and create infighting and lies, and then it's even come out in cases that they indeed were on government payroll.
[01:56:33.347 --> 01:56:33.947]  That's right.
[01:56:33.967 --> 01:56:42.235]  In fact, the obvious one that comes to mind, and this is public knowledge because he was on television right after 9-11, was Colonel Bo Greitz.
[01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:46.131]  He had his own shortwave Patriot station.
[01:56:46.932 --> 01:56:48.513]  He was collecting the names of people.
[01:56:48.573 --> 01:56:52.195]  He said on the air many times he left the Pentagon with hip pocket orders.
[01:56:53.015 --> 01:56:54.876]  And after 9-11, he came out.
[01:56:54.896 --> 01:56:56.177]  He was on the Congressional steps.
[01:56:56.197 --> 01:56:57.358]  It was on television.
[01:56:57.678 --> 01:57:02.541]  He said, I think it's those crazy paranoid shortwave Patriot types who did this.
[01:57:03.061 --> 01:57:03.741]  That's what he said.
[01:57:03.921 --> 01:57:06.023]  He said, quote, black helicopters.
[01:57:06.063 --> 01:57:07.884]  He said black helicopters.
[01:57:07.904 --> 01:57:09.845]  There were bombings going on and I said it was.
[01:57:11.085 --> 01:57:13.005]  Uh, because it was a smiley face they were bombing.
[01:57:13.085 --> 01:57:15.546]  I said, that looks like Fight Club, but it didn't matter.
[01:57:15.566 --> 01:57:23.947]  And then I got mad at him, and then I wasn't the Patriot, because I said, oh my gosh, uh, this guy is, is now demonizing everybody he claimed to work with.
[01:57:24.127 --> 01:57:28.428]  And he never mentioned on television, he'd just done about four years on Patriot Broadcasting.
[01:57:28.448 --> 01:57:35.029]  I mean, it was so obvious, and he blamed the Patriot broadcasters for being behind this, yeah.
[01:57:36.189 --> 01:57:38.750]  That's just incredible, and very sad, because, uh,
[01:57:41.175 --> 01:57:44.097]  But that's what they mean for us to do, is just constantly be paranoid.
[01:57:44.157 --> 01:57:47.699]  Folks, you know you're good, you know you're not New World Order out there watching.
[01:57:48.079 --> 01:57:48.419]  Okay?
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:50.521]  Say I'm bad, say whoever's bad, it doesn't matter.
[01:57:51.141 --> 01:57:52.822]  At least you know you're good.
[01:57:53.403 --> 01:57:55.784]  Go out and fight, wake people up, get involved.
[01:57:55.804 --> 01:57:57.105]  Because the globalists aren't as powerful.
[01:57:57.125 --> 01:57:58.206]  They don't have that many agents.
[01:57:58.466 --> 01:57:59.927]  They're trying to create them right now.
[01:58:00.307 --> 01:58:01.247]  But you'll know an agent.
[01:58:01.287 --> 01:58:02.448]  I mean, I've run into hundreds of them.
[01:58:02.468 --> 01:58:03.989]  They say, let's carry out terror attacks.
[01:58:04.009 --> 01:58:05.250]  Let's attack police, Alex.
[01:58:05.650 --> 01:58:07.411]  And you follow them to their unmarked police car.
[01:58:07.771 --> 01:58:10.073]  I mean, it's very obvious to notice these people.
[01:58:10.513 --> 01:58:18.240]  Feds don't get on air and say, you have power, you can affect change, Bill of Rights, Constitution, we can wake up the police and military, we can defeat the globalist program.
[01:58:18.741 --> 01:58:21.744]  They don't get up and explain to you how psychological warfare operates.
[01:58:21.764 --> 01:58:25.547]  What they do is, they come in, and they attack other patriots.
[01:58:25.647 --> 01:58:35.596]  That's always what they do, and they are intensifying their operations right now, because we're, I mean, we have government documents that the army is watching and tracking myself and others, okay?
[01:58:36.817 --> 01:58:53.962]  I've got data as well, data that comes through many different sources and it's the same across Britain, Canada, the US, where they are monitoring openly and attacking, cyber attacks on people who are talk show hosts.
[01:58:53.982 --> 01:59:00.584]  Now you're talking about the ratings and how they fiddle with the ratings and I use one server
[01:59:01.324 --> 01:59:18.251]  And I know, often I'll put all my different sites onto his server, so it's all drawn off his, and people will email me the next day after my own shows, and they'll congratulate me or something, or add information to it, but that server has a reading of zero.
[01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:21.312]  Zero people coming in to see it, which is nonsense.
[01:59:22.393 --> 01:59:27.195]  That's what they do, they can fiddle the statistics with everything, and just make you disappear if need be.
[01:59:28.908 --> 01:59:32.289]  Well now, I didn't get to it earlier, but we actually have the video clip.
[01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:39.052]  It's up on InfoWars.com of John Rockefeller up there in West Virginia.
[01:59:40.552 --> 01:59:43.253]  And he's openly coming out and saying they want to shut the web down.
[01:59:43.293 --> 01:59:44.653]  I mean, this is all over the news now.
[01:59:44.693 --> 01:59:45.794]  We kept warning people.
[01:59:46.574 --> 01:59:57.658]  Yes, and I've read articles before from mainstream media where they've shown you the photographs of these cyber teams for the military who have been given the go-ahead to attack
[01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:58.921]  We're good to go.
[02:00:20.522 --> 02:00:45.013]  Well that's exactly what I was about to say and that's now they admit under federal law 96, I reported this five years before it was mainstream news, I read the Adult Communications Act, that they actually, even when they're turned off, track you, listen to you, that all these systems are doing it.
[02:00:45.693 --> 02:00:46.054]  Again,
[02:00:46.934 --> 02:00:51.055]  We have an illegitimate criminal government that follows a mindset of eugenics.
[02:00:51.395 --> 02:00:53.976]  That's their excuse for all the ruthless, wicked things they do.
[02:00:54.016 --> 02:00:54.956]  They believe they're God.
[02:00:55.316 --> 02:00:58.177]  They believe they're creating the new man.
[02:00:59.017 --> 02:01:01.137]  And it's just amazing what they're doing.
[02:01:01.618 --> 02:01:09.419]  Now, I want to go to some phone calls here in closing with you, Alan, but is there anything else that you want to add?
[02:01:09.439 --> 02:01:09.499]  Yes.
[02:01:13.843 --> 02:01:22.494]  We're dealing with, as you say pretty well, a criminal gangster brotherhood at the top that has had its own way for so long behind the scenes.
[02:01:22.514 --> 02:01:25.217]  They've got everything done they wish to accomplish at that time.
[02:01:25.237 --> 02:01:27.840]  They're coming out into the open now.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:32.146]  They want us to respect them as a criminal gangster team and to obey them.
[02:01:33.112 --> 02:01:35.574]  And we don't have long to go now.
[02:01:35.594 --> 02:01:43.740]  It doesn't take long once tyranny is underway and you're used to seeing neighbours dragged off in the middle of the night before you accept that as the new normal.
[02:01:44.401 --> 02:01:48.024]  And then you're too ashamed to participate or stand up for anyone.
[02:01:48.644 --> 02:01:50.846]  You've got to do it now because they're on a roll.
[02:01:51.931 --> 02:01:53.531]  They're deadly serious, and I mean that.
[02:01:53.591 --> 02:01:55.392]  These guys are killers at the top.
[02:01:55.492 --> 02:01:58.612]  They look upon society as just blank faces.
[02:01:58.632 --> 02:01:59.553]  They don't see people.
[02:01:59.953 --> 02:02:07.134]  They see a mass of blank faces that are just superfluous at this moment, and they want to bring the population down.
[02:02:07.154 --> 02:02:13.676]  They've published all their findings over and over and over, and what they do is they don't put any of this through any Congress.
[02:02:13.736 --> 02:02:15.876]  They simply make it happen through us.
[02:02:15.916 --> 02:02:16.296]  Exactly.
[02:02:16.836 --> 02:02:19.817]  And for all those that are attacking us, Alan,
[02:02:20.977 --> 02:02:30.983]  And for those that aren't government operatives that pick up on it and attack yourself and others, understand folks, that's the mark that we're affecting change, that we're for real.
[02:02:31.864 --> 02:02:35.346]  The evidence is proven by our fruits.
[02:02:35.926 --> 02:02:37.687]  By their fruits you will know them.
[02:02:38.027 --> 02:02:45.012]  You need to ask those people that are attacking us, or tell those that are brainwashing, why do these people only spend their time attacking other patriots?
[02:02:45.712 --> 02:02:48.673]  Because they are feds or federally handled.
[02:02:49.414 --> 02:03:01.039]  And again, it doesn't bother me when this happens because I know that means I'm effective, but I hate seeing well-meaning people not get involved in the fight full bore because they're so busy chasing their tail in these little systems.
[02:03:01.139 --> 02:03:08.522]  It's not going to save the country and the world if we all just police each other and boss each other around and nitpick at each other.
[02:03:08.542 --> 02:03:10.943]  That's the mark of COINTELPRO or mentally ill people.
[02:03:12.116 --> 02:03:18.297]  What we've got to do is get the people to say no to the New World Order, no to gun confiscation, no to national draft.
[02:03:18.798 --> 02:03:23.359]  That this is tyranny, that the bankers and the private Federal Reserve need to be brought to justice, need to be arrested.
[02:03:23.639 --> 02:03:25.719]  I'm risking my life talking like that, folks.
[02:03:25.759 --> 02:03:26.759]  This is dangerous!
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:29.920]  We're focused on the New World Order, that's the key.
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:30.280]  Alan?
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:38.222]  We are, and sure enough it is dangerous because we're trying to motivate people to stand up for themselves before it's too late.
[02:03:39.153 --> 02:03:43.556]  And really, one of the people, there are callers who are talking about what we can do about it.
[02:03:44.296 --> 02:03:58.826]  One thing that has to be done is that every agency that is private, like the Constituent Foreign Relations at the top and Trilateral and so on, have to be completely disbanded and have nothing to do with government input whatsoever because they're unelected by any people.
[02:03:59.146 --> 02:04:02.328]  They're private organizations funded by the bankers directly.
[02:04:03.024 --> 02:04:15.590]  And we've got to get rid of that, so these organizations that have the ear, they have the think tanks that advise the military, this is a supra-government over and above the elected government.
[02:04:16.031 --> 02:04:20.413]  It's got to be literally made illegal to operate.
[02:04:20.833 --> 02:04:22.894]  Alright, let's go to calls in the time we have left.
[02:04:23.374 --> 02:04:26.636]  Abby in New York, first caller, thanks for holding, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[02:04:27.896 --> 02:04:30.298]  Yes, hi, this is Abby in New York, thank you so much.
[02:04:31.556 --> 02:04:43.660]  I just recently watched Obama's reception and endgame and I finally feel like I have an answer to everything I have been feeling that was not right in our nation.
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:56.185]  That's because instead of seeing all the false paradigm and the distractions and the false template they load into your brain, now you're at the elite perspective from their own documents of how they say they're running the world.
[02:04:56.205 --> 02:04:56.665]  Go ahead.
[02:04:58.055 --> 02:05:06.196]  Yes, um, you know, I mean, we're meant to be codependent to our government, almost in a constant state of reaction to what's going on, but not to have free thinking.
[02:05:06.717 --> 02:05:08.677]  And I realized, you know, I went to public school.
[02:05:08.997 --> 02:05:10.457]  It starts in public school.
[02:05:10.477 --> 02:05:11.897]  You know, don't question what you're learning.
[02:05:11.917 --> 02:05:13.758]  Don't question where it comes from.
[02:05:14.298 --> 02:05:16.398]  Just repeat it, you know, up to college.
[02:05:16.958 --> 02:05:20.159]  I went to a major university in Pennsylvania, same thing there.
[02:05:20.739 --> 02:05:26.780]  And then, you know, you're given, you know, the choice to join corporate America, or else you're considered a failure at that point.
[02:05:27.538 --> 02:05:29.680]  And, you know, I've been living out here in New York.
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:34.144]  There is a youth movement for going against the world order.
[02:05:34.184 --> 02:05:35.865]  There is a developing awareness.
[02:05:37.206 --> 02:05:41.070]  I'm looking forward to being a part of that in my own way out here.
[02:05:41.090 --> 02:05:55.162]  One thing I wanted to bring up that concerned me about modern eugenics experiments taking place was at the university I attended there was a DNA project, a mapping project to see how we were all related
[02:05:55.860 --> 02:06:07.903]  Um, as far as our race and genes went, and this is being, uh, as part of the, uh, Genome Project, um, I participated, and now they have, you know, my DNA, everyone else's DNA, who knows what it's being used for.
[02:06:08.083 --> 02:06:15.825]  Oh yeah, that whole National Geographic thing ties back to Cold Springs Harbor, Cold Springs Harbor in New York.
[02:06:16.086 --> 02:06:21.607]  Uh, why don't you explain to them, Allen, uh, IBM, Cold Springs Harbor, National Geographic.
[02:06:22.427 --> 02:06:24.788]  We've got to remember, yeah, Cold Springs Harbor was set up.
[02:06:25.388 --> 02:06:32.050]  By the American Eugenics Society, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Foundation.
[02:06:32.630 --> 02:06:49.094]  They brought in a census to literally to start to track the offspring of people, keep their medical, psychological records, any mental illness in the family, any prison records and so on, to see if the genes were sort of as, and they would keep popping up down through the generations.
[02:06:49.134 --> 02:06:50.815]  They were already categorizing
[02:06:51.315 --> 02:06:57.136]  Different people down through the generations from the early, from the late 1800s right through to the present time.
[02:06:57.396 --> 02:07:03.818]  That was the sole purpose of it initially, was to track the genes of the people to see who would have to be eliminated and who would not.
[02:07:04.318 --> 02:07:11.319]  Because they claim that if you have a murderer in your family line ten generations ago, it's liable to pop up again.
[02:07:11.699 --> 02:07:16.420]  So you just can't take the chance with you, you have to be eliminated eventually or sterilized.
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:21.021]  That's still the policy that they have at the top today, so you're quite correct, yeah.
[02:07:22.074 --> 02:07:23.195]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:07:23.215 --> 02:07:24.515]  Good to hear from you, Abby.
[02:07:24.535 --> 02:07:25.155]  God bless you.
[02:07:25.596 --> 02:07:27.817]  Brent in New Orleans, you're on the air.
[02:07:27.857 --> 02:07:28.217]  Welcome.
[02:07:29.577 --> 02:07:31.118]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:07:31.658 --> 02:07:33.979]  I just wanted to get out one little point.
[02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:42.303]  In mainstream media right now, they're talking about Timothy Geithner being the quote-unquote architect of the Bush bailouts, right?
[02:07:45.020 --> 02:07:45.560]  Is that correct?
[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:48.121]  Well, some of them have said that.
[02:07:48.261 --> 02:07:50.102]  I don't really accept that.
[02:07:50.122 --> 02:07:53.943]  I think it's much higher powers, but they'll never even hear their names at the top to be honest with you.
[02:07:53.963 --> 02:07:54.243]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:54.763 --> 02:07:58.224]  In fact, they were talking to me just for a second when you were talking here behind scenes.
[02:07:58.945 --> 02:07:59.965]  What exactly was your question?
[02:08:01.448 --> 02:08:06.112]  They're talking about Timothy Geithner being the architect of the Bush-Bell outbreak.
[02:08:06.132 --> 02:08:06.913]  No, no, no.
[02:08:07.294 --> 02:08:08.615]  I said when they first put him in.
[02:08:09.055 --> 02:08:14.941]  They blame it on Paulson, but meanwhile it turns out Geithner helped write part of it, but he's a high-level functionary.
[02:08:15.581 --> 02:08:20.946]  His father headed up a major foundation that Obama's mother worked for him as his adjunct.
[02:08:21.887 --> 02:08:22.568]  As his second.
[02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:38.720]  And then the new blame goes on the new puppet.
[02:08:39.401 --> 02:08:46.042]  So this is a microcosm of how they blame everything on Bush, then bring Obama in, later they'll blame everything on Obama, bring in the next savior.
[02:08:46.342 --> 02:08:54.724]  This is all part of the very simplistic bait-and-switch, only one of hundreds of different psychological warfare tricks they play, wrapped together.
[02:08:54.804 --> 02:08:55.964]  Alan Watt, you want to comment on that?
[02:08:55.984 --> 02:08:59.225]  Yes, and all these people who take the blame end up with golden parachutes.
[02:08:59.245 --> 02:09:03.826]  Remember, Richard Nixon left, supposedly, the White House in disgrace.
[02:09:04.446 --> 02:09:10.831]  We didn't know that he was given one of the most important jobs ever, after that, until he died.
[02:09:10.951 --> 02:09:19.118]  And that was to help set up the free trade system with China, help all the money flow through China to build up to be the manufacturer of the world.
[02:09:19.458 --> 02:09:20.239]  We didn't know that.
[02:09:20.259 --> 02:09:22.501]  That was kept totally secret until he died.
[02:09:22.761 --> 02:09:25.283]  Then he was given a military funeral.
[02:09:26.147 --> 02:09:29.030]  For his role in setting up the New World Order.
[02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:32.773]  They never ever fade off and are admonished.
[02:09:32.993 --> 02:09:35.295]  They're always given a golden parachute and a handshake.
[02:09:35.535 --> 02:09:41.721]  And they probably knew a long time before that, look, you're going to take the rap for something, but really we're promoting you to a higher level.
[02:09:41.801 --> 02:09:42.301]  Exactly.
[02:09:42.542 --> 02:09:44.864]  One year after, on average, they then rehabilitate.
[02:09:44.884 --> 02:09:46.705]  They're already starting to rehabilitate Bush.
[02:09:47.686 --> 02:09:54.332]  Okay, and then, oh, Obama says Bush was right, and then Obama will be the fall guy, and then they'll rehabilitate him, and he'll get... Look at Tony Blair.
[02:09:54.352 --> 02:09:57.716]  You know, he's the head UN envoy for the Middle East.
[02:09:57.736 --> 02:10:01.019]  They're talking about him being, in the future, the head of the European Union.
[02:10:01.621 --> 02:10:02.502]  That's right.
[02:10:02.522 --> 02:10:16.030]  So they never ever, they know this, they know it's part of the game and they take the rap publicly and meanwhile they have their drinks behind the closed doors and congratulate each other and then they're given directorships on lots and lots of boards for the payoffs.
[02:10:16.190 --> 02:10:16.390]  Sure.
[02:10:16.450 --> 02:10:17.231]  That's how it happens.
[02:10:18.064 --> 02:10:42.279]  In fact, you don't get into the real power elite until after you've been a Prime Minister, or a President, or a National Security Advisor, and then you enter the super-college of real technocrats who then meet weekly around the world to fine-tune their sub-directorates, and that's what the CFR wrote last week with James Jones, the head of the National Security Council that we cover in the Obama Deception, where he says, look, he's there speaking, he goes, where do I follow my orders?
[02:10:42.459 --> 02:10:43.319]  What do I formulate?
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:45.781]  I follow the orders of Dr. Henry Kissinger.
[02:10:46.081 --> 02:10:58.503]  Yes, and Margaret Thatcher said in 1990 at Massey Hall in Toronto, her series of lectures across the world was called The New World Order and the coming war on fundamentalist religion.
[02:10:59.543 --> 02:11:04.144]  She said that I now belong to the parallel government.
[02:11:04.184 --> 02:11:12.186]  She said all ex-prime ministers and presidents and top-level bureaucrats who all know each other, we can get the job done, we're not answerable to the public.
[02:11:12.226 --> 02:11:13.386]  She called it the real government.
[02:11:14.912 --> 02:11:20.217]  And they say it on record because Margaret Thatcher will write a book that's only for technocrats that maybe 20,000 copies sells.
[02:11:21.418 --> 02:11:26.622]  Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, writes Men in Power, says world government runs everything, Bilderberg Group, eugenics.
[02:11:26.682 --> 02:11:29.564]  I love doing druidic rituals in Northern California.
[02:11:29.805 --> 02:11:31.626]  We do rituals in Germany.
[02:11:31.926 --> 02:11:34.348]  In fact, it's in there on the shelf at the end of the long hall.
[02:11:34.849 --> 02:11:35.810]  I pulled it out last week.
[02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:36.550]  Nobody put it back.
[02:11:36.610 --> 02:11:38.172]  It's on the shelf on the end of that hall.
[02:11:38.712 --> 02:11:40.433]  Men in Power is a political retrospective.
[02:11:40.453 --> 02:11:41.214]  Somebody bring that in.
[02:11:41.874 --> 02:11:46.338]  And they brag in the books, the idiots don't read books.
[02:11:46.658 --> 02:11:51.481]  Those that do, they read Harry Potter or Hardy Boy and Nancy Drew or something.
[02:11:52.722 --> 02:11:54.344]  Or they read some stupid Obama book.
[02:11:55.144 --> 02:11:56.665]  So it's a big joke.
[02:11:57.566 --> 02:11:59.808]  It's like Rothkopf, the former head of the Kissinger Group.
[02:12:00.088 --> 02:12:02.329]  We call him up, he goes, yeah, I want to go on Encounter, Mr. Jones.
[02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:05.172]  And he admits, yeah, we're setting up a world government, but it's for your own good.
[02:12:05.412 --> 02:12:06.553]  And his book's super class.
[02:12:07.426 --> 02:12:10.987]  He writes an article for the Washington Post bragging world government is good for you.
[02:12:11.927 --> 02:12:13.748]  Yeah.
[02:12:13.828 --> 02:12:15.868]  It is in the open for those that want to go and read it.
[02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:18.229]  But it's never mentioned on mainstream media.
[02:12:19.049 --> 02:12:19.469]  Yeah.
[02:12:19.509 --> 02:12:23.010]  Listen, I don't want to abuse much more of our guest's time, but let's hurry through a few more calls here.
[02:12:23.050 --> 02:12:23.510]  Thank you, Brent.
[02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:24.771]  Hope that answers your question.
[02:12:24.851 --> 02:12:26.831]  Nick in North Carolina.
[02:12:26.851 --> 02:12:29.732]  You're on the air with the one, the only, Alan Waddiff, coming to TheMatrix.com.
[02:12:32.237 --> 02:12:35.680]  Bulletproof Global Mega Celebrity Alex Jones and MI6 Operative Alan Watt.
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:36.300]  How's it going?
[02:12:36.481 --> 02:12:37.221]  Pleasure to be on the show.
[02:12:39.403 --> 02:12:41.985]  I got three real quick ones here, starting with a plug if I may.
[02:12:43.706 --> 02:12:46.348]  My buddy and I are doing a site, nwolinks.com.
[02:12:46.368 --> 02:12:49.070]  We're trying to compile the best information on all this stuff for everyone.
[02:12:49.170 --> 02:12:50.071]  We just need some help.
[02:12:50.251 --> 02:12:54.234]  If you guys can help, go to the site, send us an email, give us more information.
[02:12:54.254 --> 02:12:54.915]  We're hungry for more.
[02:12:54.955 --> 02:12:57.957]  So if you guys got videos or anything to send us, please do that.
[02:12:58.684 --> 02:13:02.747]  And then, uh, number two, um, borrow from the Ron Paul campaign real quick.
[02:13:02.887 --> 02:13:05.448]  I got an idea that's not quite as talk-centric, Alex.
[02:13:06.129 --> 02:13:08.831]  Um, we did it for Ron Paul and I was wondering if we could do it again.
[02:13:08.871 --> 02:13:10.732]  Maybe, uh, have some sort of, um...
[02:13:11.677 --> 02:13:29.043]  I've been trying for two weeks, three weeks just to get a little activist page on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with just a few banners and, hey folks have viewing parties for the film and I'm working on getting that done.
[02:13:29.063 --> 02:13:31.764]  I'm this big global mega celebrity but I can't even get that done.
[02:13:33.045 --> 02:13:33.906]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:13:34.187 --> 02:13:35.028]  I mean, literally.
[02:13:35.949 --> 02:13:37.431]  But yes, that's a good idea.
[02:13:37.671 --> 02:13:39.834]  We're also making some street action flyers for folks.
[02:13:40.174 --> 02:13:42.117]  We just don't have the money to buy a bunch of billboards.
[02:13:42.157 --> 02:13:43.339]  But if individuals or groups...
[02:13:45.424 --> 02:13:46.564]  Well, that's another issue.
[02:13:46.625 --> 02:13:47.465]  I can't have one of those.
[02:13:47.485 --> 02:13:49.806]  We haven't worked out the technology for that and probably never will.
[02:13:50.366 --> 02:13:53.047]  But we are trying as best we can, sir.
[02:13:53.067 --> 02:13:53.507]  Believe me.
[02:13:53.707 --> 02:14:00.230]  I need people to buy the DVDs at InfoWars.com so I can hire more people so we can do more.
[02:14:00.590 --> 02:14:02.611]  But then I'm too busy giving them out for free to ever do that.
[02:14:02.651 --> 02:14:03.632]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:06.673 --> 02:14:07.713]  Can I ask you?
[02:14:08.053 --> 02:14:09.094]  I've got one guest for you.
[02:14:10.051 --> 02:14:14.093]  You gotta give this guy on Russ Baker, he got a book that came out this year, Family of Secrets.
[02:14:14.153 --> 02:14:18.134]  He like, digs way deep into the Bush history and the Kennedy assassination.
[02:14:18.154 --> 02:14:19.435]  This book is amazing, Alex.
[02:14:19.495 --> 02:14:20.375]  Okay, we'll check it out.
[02:14:20.575 --> 02:14:22.416]  Send me an email, appreciate it.
[02:14:22.476 --> 02:14:25.337]  Yeah, speaking of funds, I mean, Alan Watt can barely operate.
[02:14:25.777 --> 02:14:31.400]  I mean, I've been able to go around and raise enough sponsors and bust my hind end and get enough money to fund something here.
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:34.481]  It's called Men and Powers, a Political Retrospective.
[02:14:34.521 --> 02:14:35.902]  It's in your hand right there.
[02:14:37.003 --> 02:14:38.603]  And so I'm just trying as hard as I can.
[02:14:38.623 --> 02:14:40.184]  But yes, we need your financial support.
[02:14:40.644 --> 02:14:41.064]  I need it.
[02:14:41.345 --> 02:14:42.185]  Buy the books and videos.
[02:14:42.205 --> 02:14:42.945]  So does Alan Watt.
[02:14:42.985 --> 02:14:43.926]  Alan, how do folks support you?
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:58.193]  I think that they're cutting through the Matrix.com website and they can see there's buttons there, there's PayPal, they can buy my books and so on about this coded system in which we live, where literally the language itself is used as a technique for controlling us.
[02:14:58.673 --> 02:15:00.415]  It's psycho-linguistics, really.
[02:15:00.859 --> 02:15:11.648]  Yeah, that's what Orwell talked about because he'd been a member of the secret police in India, then he'd been in wars for the communists in Spain, then he'd lived homeless just to see what it was like down and out in Paris and France.
[02:15:11.668 --> 02:15:15.491]  You can read all about that in To Kill an Elephant and all his little essays, I've read them all.
[02:15:16.152 --> 02:15:27.301]  And then he went to the BBC and he found out, my God, it's a global government, a secret society of eugenicists playing everybody off against each other for the sadistic pleasure of stomping on the human soul forever.
[02:15:28.001 --> 02:15:30.282]  And he wrote that book, and a lot of evidence shows they killed him.
[02:15:30.342 --> 02:15:31.642]  Alan Watt, comments on that?
[02:15:32.282 --> 02:15:32.842]  That is right.
[02:15:32.862 --> 02:15:33.122]  He did.
[02:15:33.162 --> 02:15:39.964]  Actually, he went off to live in a very remote island in Scotland that has lots of adders all around it.
[02:15:39.984 --> 02:15:41.464]  The adder is snake, very poisonous.
[02:15:42.644 --> 02:15:46.125]  To be a recluse, because he thought they were going to send men after him to kill him.
[02:15:46.825 --> 02:15:53.286]  And he'd always check the incoming boat once a month to see who was on it, to see if it was a possible assassin on board.
[02:15:53.566 --> 02:15:55.787]  He knew, because, you see, he was raised
[02:15:57.229 --> 02:16:01.090]  To work for them, to help bring in this world system.
[02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:05.851]  And many of the people in those days truly thought it was going to be better than having perpetual wars.
[02:16:06.251 --> 02:16:07.431]  That's how it was fed to them.
[02:16:08.311 --> 02:16:12.472]  Until they realized that there was another group at the top running all this and all sides.
[02:16:13.152 --> 02:16:13.572]  That's right.
[02:16:13.652 --> 02:16:14.992]  He was a top socialist.
[02:16:15.032 --> 02:16:20.453]  His family was actually mid-level British aristocracy at the technocrat level.
[02:16:20.733 --> 02:16:24.794]  And he was married in to the Darwin's and the Galton's and all of them.
[02:16:25.094 --> 02:16:25.274]  Mm-hmm.
[02:16:25.755 --> 02:16:28.276]  And his mother was a Bonapartist, they called him.
[02:16:29.077 --> 02:16:36.822]  And he'd been fed idealism from birth, until he realized by the war in Spain, when he was participating in it there,
[02:16:37.518 --> 02:16:45.701]  He realized there was another party running all sides of every outbreak, and he saw the long-term arrangements, and he spoke out against it.
[02:16:46.021 --> 02:16:47.862]  Then the socialists turned their back on him.
[02:16:48.182 --> 02:16:57.106]  That's right, he found out that British intelligence was manipulating the killer commies to throw out the idealistic commies, and they would use them.
[02:16:57.346 --> 02:16:59.587]  But then again, he was a top propagandist at BBC.
[02:17:00.507 --> 02:17:07.396]  And he's talking about himself, Eric Blair, George Orwell, pen name, when he talks about Winston Smith.
[02:17:07.676 --> 02:17:08.117]  That's right.
[02:17:08.618 --> 02:17:18.691]  And he admitted that that's where he learned it, in the Department of Propaganda, World War II, Britain, BBC, because he worked in that department to convince British housewives
[02:17:19.131 --> 02:17:26.596]  But the cheap junk food that they were left with because of the war, all the fatty stuff and so on, was actually better nutrition for them.
[02:17:27.016 --> 02:17:37.283]  And once again, they're using the expert terminology, convincing public that... And how they train the children to be spies on their parents, youth brigades, squads, everything...
[02:17:38.183 --> 02:17:45.047]  He figures out, he's walking down the street and a buzz bomb flies in from East Asia, blows up a building, and he goes, oh, that's the government again.
[02:17:45.067 --> 02:17:48.929]  And he realizes it's a global government all waging war on humanity.
[02:17:49.309 --> 02:17:51.130]  All having fake wars with each other.
[02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:56.733]  And again, to another good movie, in a comedy fashion, for those that can't follow it, 1984, Lord of the Rings.
[02:17:57.413 --> 02:17:58.153]  It's Brazil!
[02:17:58.213 --> 02:18:07.176]  Brazil, Terry Gwilliam put it in a comedy, and at one stage there's bombs going off everywhere in restaurants and so on, and his mother goes on as a terrorist again.
[02:18:07.196 --> 02:18:10.537]  He says, Mother, have you ever actually seen a terrorist?
[02:18:10.577 --> 02:18:11.577]  No one's ever seen one.
[02:18:12.198 --> 02:18:22.441]  And the Department of Information Retrieval is this massive, huge skyscraper, the largest building on the planet, because it's all run by information on every individual person.
[02:18:23.058 --> 02:18:29.705]  And then a bug falls off the ceiling in one of the printers, and so they come and SWAT team the dad, drag him away, and then they give the woman a bill.
[02:18:30.085 --> 02:18:33.489]  That's right, because the tape-maker went to Tuttle instead of Buttle.
[02:18:34.330 --> 02:18:36.612]  Let's take a few final calls and let you go.
[02:18:37.233 --> 02:18:38.274]  Who have I gotten up to here?
[02:18:39.595 --> 02:18:40.075]  Call Weiss?
[02:18:41.036 --> 02:18:42.598]  Francis in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:18:42.638 --> 02:18:44.240]  Another Canadian up there in the Great North.
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:46.122]  You're on the air with the one and only Alan Watt.
[02:18:47.827 --> 02:18:48.828]  Hi Alex.
[02:18:49.008 --> 02:18:58.736]  A lot of people who are new to you will have a hard time believing that these gangster gangsters are scheming to murder large numbers of us.
[02:18:59.376 --> 02:19:07.103]  But if you read Alexander Shosnitsyn's last great book, which is 200 years together, Alexander Shosnitsyn
[02:19:08.290 --> 02:19:24.319]  He gathered all the Jewish historical records in Russia, and he proved irrefutably that 95% of the Bolsheviks were Jewish, and that they murdered 45 million Russians, Ukrainians, and Armenians.
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:32.744]  And this is all a plot, and we see now these same forces, these same people are gathering here in the West,
[02:19:33.308 --> 02:19:44.132]  And they're, like Alex described so closely, like Chertoff and all these people, they're the descendants of those same Bolshevik Jews that want to murder us!
[02:19:44.983 --> 02:19:46.104]  They want to enslave us.
[02:19:46.505 --> 02:19:48.486]  They want to create artificial famines.
[02:19:48.867 --> 02:19:50.148]  They want to murder us.
[02:19:50.448 --> 02:19:51.670]  Well, let me expand on that.
[02:19:51.730 --> 02:19:56.074]  Shultz and Nielsen, you notice the media doesn't want to attack him because he's a Pulitzer Prize winner and everything else.
[02:19:56.714 --> 02:20:02.000]  His book does get into that, but then you have to understand that there was a purge by Stalin against those people.
[02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:05.663]  That's why Trotsky ran over here and created the neocons today.
[02:20:06.604 --> 02:20:17.469]  When you find out that there's another layer, like the Zionists at the beginning funded Hitler, and then made the Jews in Germany and in Poland pay million-dollar fees to allow them to escape to Israel.
[02:20:17.509 --> 02:20:19.310]  They couldn't go to England, couldn't go to New York.
[02:20:19.710 --> 02:20:29.815]  So you find out then, and I'm certainly, it's terrible what went on there, and we're not denying that, but there is a level above that with, and people say, oh, you're just bashing Germans.
[02:20:29.975 --> 02:20:33.997]  No, folks, I'm saying there's a level above that, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:20:34.017 --> 02:20:35.298]  That's a great question for Alan Watt.
[02:20:36.238 --> 02:20:38.039]  Well, I haven't heard him asked.
[02:20:38.339 --> 02:20:50.408]  I know you've done the same research as me, and even deeper in many cases, so I know you'll concur with the facts we just stated, but there is a level above that, if you just intellectually are honest, a level above that.
[02:20:50.708 --> 02:20:59.734]  So when we look at the Rothschilds allied with the British, Anglo-American establishment, telling Hitler to go ahead and invade countries, then setting him up, he lets the British evacuate at Dunkirk,
[02:21:00.254 --> 02:21:04.636]  They send in the Reich Fuhrer, Rudolf Hess, who parachutes in.
[02:21:04.736 --> 02:21:06.316]  You know, the King of England was a Nazi.
[02:21:06.536 --> 02:21:07.357]  They made him abdicate.
[02:21:07.377 --> 02:21:08.517]  He said, why are you doing this?
[02:21:08.557 --> 02:21:09.358]  We had a deal.
[02:21:09.858 --> 02:21:10.878]  So they betrayed them.
[02:21:11.138 --> 02:21:15.080]  The globalists betray everyone.
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:20.042]  And so, yes, any power group is under their control, whether it's Jews, Germans.
[02:21:20.082 --> 02:21:25.864]  Yeah, they always look for a group and it's a minority that is under some kind of persecution.
[02:21:26.796 --> 02:21:35.863]  And that's the ones that will agitate and stir, and they will use them, and they might use them for 50 or 100 years until they've achieved their objective, and then they'll annihilate them as well.
[02:21:36.844 --> 02:21:37.965]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:21:38.985 --> 02:21:46.051]  Even, I think it's Rabbi Steven Yakov, who does a shortwave program at night.
[02:21:46.071 --> 02:21:47.352]  He's a rabbi and he
[02:21:48.286 --> 02:21:50.669]  He really goes out against the Palestinians all the time.
[02:21:50.689 --> 02:21:54.252]  He doesn't hold anything back and he's disgusted, etc.
[02:21:54.352 --> 02:22:07.786]  However, he did admit on a couple of his shows that the Jews that lived in Russia and in the Pale of Settlement certainly fell for the whole idea of communism and helped to bring it into being.
[02:22:08.567 --> 02:22:10.828]  Now that's a fact, and then went after the Ukrainian Christians.
[02:22:11.148 --> 02:22:23.853]  Look, this is Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, and you just go to the index under B, and it says Bilderberg 222, and also under B is Bohemian Grove 225.
[02:22:23.893 --> 02:22:26.174]  So let me go to 222.
[02:22:26.214 --> 02:22:30.496]  222, this is written by the President of the Chancellor of Germany. 222.
[02:22:33.971 --> 02:22:34.952]  Two, two, two.
[02:22:35.392 --> 02:22:35.873]  Here it is.
[02:22:36.574 --> 02:22:41.138]  And he admits that there is a world government, shadow world government run by the Bilderberg Group.
[02:22:41.678 --> 02:22:43.620]  I have shots of this in my Bohemian Grove film.
[02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:50.326]  It says Henry Kissinger is a Brittany Brzezinski, William Kaufman, and it goes on to say,
[02:22:52.034 --> 02:23:14.531]  AFL-CIO, Joe Gimini, Lane Kirkland, and it says, basically setting up world government, Bilderberg Conferences, the Prince Bernard, the Netherlands organized and ran yearly meetings, the London Institute for Strategic Studies, and the leadership of Alistair Buchan, some of the United States Senators, active foreign, and it goes on to talk about how they're setting up a global government there.
[02:23:15.732 --> 02:23:24.438]  And here is another one on 225, where he gets into Bohemian Grove, a tiny area of the beautiful nature alone.
[02:23:24.478 --> 02:23:27.920]  But you can read, he says, we do rituals in Germany.
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:33.744]  But my favorite place, we have our own groves in Germany, but my favorite place is Northern California and how they set globalist policy.
[02:23:34.344 --> 02:23:35.745]  I mean, I can just read all this on air.
[02:23:35.765 --> 02:23:38.947]  But the point is, there are hundreds of books written by these people.
[02:23:39.768 --> 02:23:43.050]  And then the New York Times just a few years ago was saying Bilderberg didn't exist, Alan.
[02:23:43.843 --> 02:23:44.283]  Yeah, I know.
[02:23:45.985 --> 02:23:47.006]  But it's out in the open now.
[02:23:47.026 --> 02:23:48.147]  They don't really care so much.
[02:23:49.168 --> 02:23:53.492]  We've got to realize, too, we're dealing with people who don't believe.
[02:23:53.512 --> 02:23:55.454]  They have to give us any answers to anything.
[02:23:55.634 --> 02:23:57.996]  They're beyond answering to the public.
[02:23:58.717 --> 02:24:01.839]  And in the past, they just ignored the public altogether.
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:04.402]  And so did the press on their behalf.
[02:24:05.466 --> 02:24:17.057]  It's in the open today because they're on a roll, and to be honest with you, they really think that most of the general public of the world are so apathetic now that they don't really care who rules them or what kind of system they're ruled under.
[02:24:17.897 --> 02:24:19.058]  That's what they think.
[02:24:19.098 --> 02:24:25.264]  They've taken apathy to such a level now, and that was predicted by Bertrand Russell in the 50s.
[02:24:25.284 --> 02:24:30.629]  They would create apathy, and once you're apathetic, you allow yourself to be manipulated or controlled.
[02:24:31.449 --> 02:24:43.014]  And of course his quote was, a revolt by the general public, the proletariat will be as impossible and unthinkable as a revolt of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[02:24:43.234 --> 02:24:43.615]  That's right.
[02:24:44.315 --> 02:24:45.936]  And for those that don't know, mutton is sheep.
[02:24:46.476 --> 02:24:52.799]  And Rockefeller himself said that the people will come to them with perfect hostility at the end.
[02:24:53.499 --> 02:24:55.100]  And that's because they've trained the public.
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:57.062]  First, Madison Avenue makes you feel inadequate.
[02:24:57.322 --> 02:24:58.103]  Women especially.
[02:24:58.503 --> 02:24:58.963]  But men.
[02:24:59.323 --> 02:25:04.347]  Men, it's all acting tough, but not being involved in your country or being involved or kill them brown people, that's manly.
[02:25:04.667 --> 02:25:08.010]  But then bowing down to the corrupt system and shaking, you know, the IRS.
[02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:12.633]  Once they make you feel inadequate, then you have no respect for yourself.
[02:25:13.114 --> 02:25:15.135]  And then you're always looking for a leader to save you.
[02:25:15.175 --> 02:25:16.936]  Now, again, Alan's got to go in just a moment.
[02:25:17.117 --> 02:25:19.618]  We'll give each caller one minute and a quick answer from Alan Watt.
[02:25:19.919 --> 02:25:21.620]  Leo and Mash, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[02:25:22.864 --> 02:25:24.106]  Hi, thanks for taking the call.
[02:25:25.468 --> 02:25:28.713]  I think the factor we're missing here is the quick gesture factor.
[02:25:29.334 --> 02:25:38.307]  Now, the other day I spoke to Jack McGlam and they're talking about they want to shut down open free speech.
[02:25:39.695 --> 02:25:42.936]  Anti-free speech, they want to have hate declared the truth to be hate speech?
[02:25:43.276 --> 02:25:43.456]  Yes.
[02:25:43.516 --> 02:25:46.878]  I think what we should do is dress up as gay people around D.C.
[02:25:46.918 --> 02:25:48.198]  and go to D.C.
[02:25:48.338 --> 02:25:49.799]  and ask them to ban the Bible.
[02:25:49.819 --> 02:25:52.319]  Because then that'll bring the whole thing to a head.
[02:25:52.539 --> 02:25:59.922]  But then the media, see they can play those type of tricks, having the ADL and others have been caught dressing up like Nazis, you know, trying to get hate laws passed.
[02:26:00.542 --> 02:26:02.683]  Then they would expose that we set that up.
[02:26:03.263 --> 02:26:08.226]  But see, that's why being moral, you never really have that problem, because you understand the straight and narrow.
[02:26:08.266 --> 02:26:10.627]  Look, look, being clean, not that I'm perfect.
[02:26:11.008 --> 02:26:14.290]  You know, I drink and smoke and I try to quit all the time, but I mean, I'm weak.
[02:26:14.610 --> 02:26:22.434]  But the point is, is that I got all these women, literally folks, and most of them are probably government, just throwing themselves, throwing themselves, throwing themselves at me.
[02:26:22.815 --> 02:26:24.976]  And I know that, number one, I wouldn't get my work done.
[02:26:24.996 --> 02:26:27.878]  Number two, most importantly, I'm married and love my children and my family.
[02:26:28.378 --> 02:26:29.999]  But number three, or four,
[02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:37.664]  You know, morals have been developed and designed because it's what makes you straight and strong and focused.
[02:26:38.305 --> 02:26:40.366]  But the general public is all animalistic.
[02:26:40.647 --> 02:26:46.631]  I mean, I'm more into the stars and space and the mysteries of the universe and working with and helping others.
[02:26:46.651 --> 02:26:50.033]  I get a bigger thrill out of that and so you can't buy me off.
[02:26:50.073 --> 02:26:52.015]  You can't buy me off with sex, money, power.
[02:26:52.275 --> 02:26:57.139]  You can't threaten me to back off because who I am and being good and being a good sentient creature
[02:26:57.779 --> 02:27:01.741]  is more important to me than all the treasure in the world, which is all a bunch of crap.
[02:27:02.241 --> 02:27:06.523]  So, that's what the globalists hate, because they can't control us.
[02:27:07.344 --> 02:27:08.404]  Alan, you want to speak to that?
[02:27:09.585 --> 02:27:23.151]  Yes, once again, let's go back to the writings of Russell and Huxley and others that talked about creating a degraded society, promoting sex to the extreme, even though the people would be technically sterile.
[02:27:23.611 --> 02:27:24.612]  Julian Huxley said this.
[02:27:25.345 --> 02:27:26.725]  They said they'd be technically sterile.
[02:27:27.085 --> 02:27:30.646]  They'll be encouraged to basically have as many partners as they want.
[02:27:30.706 --> 02:27:41.809]  In other words, they're basing us all into purely animalistic behavior, where we have our gratification from our senses fulfilled so quickly and easily.
[02:27:41.829 --> 02:27:46.551]  But the thing is, there's no human bonding involved in any of this.
[02:27:46.571 --> 02:27:47.851]  There's no long-term bonding.
[02:27:48.691 --> 02:27:51.733]  Uh, that was part of it to destroy bonding and fight competition.
[02:27:51.754 --> 02:27:53.195]  Yeah, it's very, very shallow.
[02:27:53.755 --> 02:27:54.676]  And I want you to expand on this.
[02:27:54.696 --> 02:27:58.178]  You know, in college, you go to parties or whatever, you know, porn's on the TV.
[02:27:58.258 --> 02:28:00.059]  It's everywhere for those older folks who don't know.
[02:28:00.099 --> 02:28:00.840]  It's everywhere now.
[02:28:01.681 --> 02:28:05.483]  And I noticed that it destroyed gratification.
[02:28:05.844 --> 02:28:08.786]  And it actually, like, burns your nerves away mentally.
[02:28:08.806 --> 02:28:12.668]  It makes sure you can't enjoy the real thing anymore.
[02:28:12.709 --> 02:28:14.390]  And, you know, so thank God I'm not into that.
[02:28:15.150 --> 02:28:17.293]  And studies have shown that.
[02:28:17.493 --> 02:28:21.737]  They thought porn 50 years ago, before they made it widespread, would make people sex maniacs.
[02:28:21.797 --> 02:28:22.678]  It does the opposite.
[02:28:22.878 --> 02:28:24.620]  And of course, they'd done these tests 100 years ago.
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:28.083]  They knew it actually destroys people's real passion.
[02:28:28.644 --> 02:28:33.809]  And then loving a woman, loving a man, loving your children, defending that, the true bond.
[02:28:34.049 --> 02:28:34.610]  Speak to that.
[02:28:35.290 --> 02:28:36.452]  Well, that's just it.
[02:28:36.492 --> 02:28:38.654]  It will destroy the idea of love, in fact.
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.841]  That's what 1984 was about!
[02:28:56.272 --> 02:28:58.133]  Yes, and it's a science again.
[02:28:58.413 --> 02:29:05.638]  You see, any instinct, any drive, can be by propaganda and repetition everywhere that you look.
[02:29:06.598 --> 02:29:15.483]  It can be made into an addiction, an utter addiction, in one way or another, until people are addicted to having partners, but not to having a relationship.
[02:29:16.024 --> 02:29:25.169]  And all these messages say children are bad, children are a hassle, but then you have all these childless people that are totally unhappy, and the fulfilled folks have the children.
[02:29:25.911 --> 02:29:32.373]  Yes, I was looking at a site recently where there actually is an article that says that children are carbon monsters.
[02:29:32.834 --> 02:29:33.474]  Who wants them?
[02:29:34.394 --> 02:29:37.275]  So that's... That horrible carbon footprint.
[02:29:37.295 --> 02:29:38.556]  Gotta stop having children.
[02:29:38.836 --> 02:29:41.297]  In fact, Australia is proposing a one-child policy now.
[02:29:41.697 --> 02:29:41.917]  Yes.
[02:29:42.657 --> 02:29:45.778]  And again, China was to be the model state for the entire world.
[02:29:46.478 --> 02:29:47.779]  And that's the way they're going.
[02:29:47.819 --> 02:29:51.100]  In China, the government still is a communist-type government.
[02:29:51.140 --> 02:29:52.281]  In other words, it's dictatorial.
[02:29:52.301 --> 02:29:53.321]  It's a one-party system.
[02:29:54.693 --> 02:30:10.741]  They're all multi-millionaires at the top there, and that's what they want to come out openly with for the rest of the world, where there's a one-party system, one boss, they tell you how to live, what to eat, what to do, walk into the sterilization factory and be a good citizen, etc, etc.
[02:30:11.001 --> 02:30:12.042]  That's what they're bringing in.
[02:30:12.242 --> 02:30:12.802]  Unbelievable.
[02:30:12.822 --> 02:30:13.622]  Who's up next?
[02:30:17.244 --> 02:30:18.505]  Alright, John in Canada, go ahead.
[02:30:20.353 --> 02:30:21.954]  Alex, it's great to speak with you.
[02:30:22.254 --> 02:30:27.375]  Listen, I just woke up last week, and after listening to your show, I had to call in.
[02:30:27.875 --> 02:30:32.837]  A close friend of mine at TruthActionOttawa.com told me about the Obama deception.
[02:30:33.257 --> 02:30:36.278]  Man, I've never been scared as much in my whole life.
[02:30:36.618 --> 02:30:37.978]  Then I watched Endgame.
[02:30:38.518 --> 02:30:40.959]  My God, Alex, how could we be so blind?
[02:30:41.439 --> 02:30:46.041]  I've always known the government was corrupt, you know, but never did I imagine it was this bad.
[02:30:47.987 --> 02:30:52.063]  You know, what we really need to do is stand together against this tyranny and
[02:30:53.092 --> 02:30:56.373]  And say that I will not allow my children to grow up and be slaves.
[02:30:56.653 --> 02:30:59.373]  They have the same right to freedom as the Bilderbergs do.
[02:30:59.753 --> 02:31:00.553]  This is foolish.
[02:31:00.593 --> 02:31:01.674]  How can we allow this to happen?
[02:31:01.734 --> 02:31:12.996]  Exactly, and you need to go to your councils, your town councils, and read these mainstream news articles saying children are carbon monsters and saying your phony environmental movement isn't about saving the rainforest or the plankton that is in danger.
[02:31:13.416 --> 02:31:18.276]  It's about taxing the carbon footprint and the carbon cycle and micromanaging every facet of our lives.
[02:31:18.597 --> 02:31:20.937]  Or point out how they're announcing in Canada and in the US
[02:31:21.457 --> 02:31:23.459]  They're going to put troops on the streets and are now doing it.
[02:31:23.799 --> 02:31:33.507]  If all of you go and create a huge chatter instead of going into being scared, if they're able to cow us and buffalo us and intimidate us into submission, they're going to win.
[02:31:33.567 --> 02:31:34.027]  Alan Watt?
[02:31:34.768 --> 02:31:35.588]  There's no doubt at all.
[02:31:35.648 --> 02:31:40.092]  And he used some of their own court cases that were meant for propaganda purposes against him.
[02:31:40.692 --> 02:31:45.677]  Because recently an environmental officer attached to a company was fired.
[02:31:45.697 --> 02:31:47.679]  It was such a pain to the company.
[02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:50.422]  And they thought they'd get some good publicity out of it.
[02:31:50.442 --> 02:31:53.184]  But it was ruled in a court decision in the U.S.
[02:31:53.865 --> 02:32:02.974]  that the belief in sustainability and environmentalism to do with man-causing carbon footprints and so on was someone's philosophical belief.
[02:32:03.797 --> 02:32:05.719]  Not a fact, but a philosophical belief.
[02:32:06.099 --> 02:32:10.662]  So why are we all having to give up everything for someone's philosophic belief?
[02:32:10.943 --> 02:32:12.404]  And again, it's all peer pressure.
[02:32:12.464 --> 02:32:13.965]  Sir, good to have you on board now.
[02:32:14.085 --> 02:32:15.466]  Share the gift of information.
[02:32:15.866 --> 02:32:17.267]  Spread the Obama deception.
[02:32:17.287 --> 02:32:20.450]  The high quality one's up on InfoWars.com for free right now.
[02:32:20.930 --> 02:32:22.191]  Spread it to your whole email list.
[02:32:22.271 --> 02:32:23.072]  Call your neighbors.
[02:32:23.112 --> 02:32:23.832]  Get aggressive.
[02:32:24.073 --> 02:32:25.814]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:32:26.354 --> 02:32:27.255]  Fifteen cents a day.
[02:32:27.375 --> 02:32:28.536]  Burn DivX copies.
[02:32:28.556 --> 02:32:29.397]  Just point and click.
[02:32:29.417 --> 02:32:30.057]  Drag it over.
[02:32:30.077 --> 02:32:30.738]  Say burn disc.
[02:32:31.178 --> 02:32:33.781]  It's almost DVD quality on a DVD or disc.
[02:32:34.081 --> 02:32:36.123]  Plays in most computers and DVD players.
[02:32:36.263 --> 02:32:37.144]  Get aggressive.
[02:32:37.444 --> 02:32:38.045]  God bless you.
[02:32:38.065 --> 02:32:38.805]  Good to hear from you.
[02:32:39.506 --> 02:32:41.087]  Allen, I think I'm going to let you go.
[02:32:41.108 --> 02:32:42.008]  I can keep twisting your arm.
[02:32:42.028 --> 02:32:43.390]  We can go to Michael Dennison.
[02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:44.050]  Your call.
[02:32:44.771 --> 02:32:48.054]  You're such a gentleman, but I don't want to scare you off from coming back on next time.
[02:32:48.094 --> 02:32:51.657]  Michael Dennison, Sean, we can take those three calls, or I can ask you this final question.
[02:32:51.677 --> 02:32:51.998]  Your call.
[02:32:52.418 --> 02:32:52.918]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:32:53.259 --> 02:32:54.019]  Okay, quickly.
[02:32:54.099 --> 02:32:55.020]  Michael in Toronto.
[02:32:55.060 --> 02:32:55.960]  Another call from Canada.
[02:32:55.980 --> 02:32:56.601]  This is crazy.
[02:32:56.941 --> 02:32:57.721]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:32:57.781 --> 02:32:58.302]  Hey, Alex.
[02:32:58.322 --> 02:32:59.522]  Great to talk to you, Alan.
[02:32:59.562 --> 02:33:01.904]  Nice to talk to you.
[02:33:02.204 --> 02:33:07.667]  I've got a question for Alan specifically regarding Canada's role in the NWO.
[02:33:08.368 --> 02:33:16.212]  I have a friend who is very high up at Wood Gundy, which is the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
[02:33:16.533 --> 02:33:16.693]  Yeah.
[02:33:17.013 --> 02:33:21.796]  And he speaks about Canada as being the administrator of the New World Order and that
[02:33:22.475 --> 02:33:28.713]  The Canadian dollar and our pension will be relatively stable comparatively to the U.S.
[02:33:30.290 --> 02:33:31.851]  Canadians have already been brought in line.
[02:33:31.911 --> 02:33:36.394]  I don't really think the Canadians are worried for the NWO.
[02:33:36.434 --> 02:33:37.575]  Can you comment to that?
[02:33:37.595 --> 02:33:39.196]  Yeah, I want to hear Alan's comment, then I've got one.
[02:33:39.236 --> 02:33:39.716]  Go ahead, Alan.
[02:33:40.336 --> 02:33:47.581]  Yeah, well, I also know people up at the bank, at the same bank too, and that is what they're told.
[02:33:47.941 --> 02:33:55.806]  They do believe that Canada has the population so happy, drunk at weekends with sports and hockey and all the rest of it, but they don't care.
[02:33:56.107 --> 02:33:58.068]  Technically, I have to say, it's really true.
[02:33:58.775 --> 02:33:59.515]  With most people.
[02:34:00.415 --> 02:34:05.016]  But Canada has a much bigger role than it lets on to have.
[02:34:05.096 --> 02:34:11.918]  In fact, I don't know if people realize that there's some very, very old wealthy families, international bankers living in Canada.
[02:34:12.658 --> 02:34:15.979]  And they give out orders to a lot of the big boys in the States, in fact.
[02:34:16.039 --> 02:34:20.960]  Yes, they've decided to make Canada kind of one of their few safe zones.
[02:34:20.980 --> 02:34:23.520]  That's why they have some of those draconian anti-free speech things.
[02:34:23.881 --> 02:34:25.381]  And Canada is a beta test
[02:34:26.301 --> 02:34:33.427]  ...of a similar model to England, but even more advanced at many levels, of how to have a highly controlled society without people seeing it.
[02:34:33.668 --> 02:34:37.391]  They call China a laboratory, they call Canada a laboratory, the U.S.
[02:34:37.451 --> 02:34:40.553]  is a lab... They have different, competing, but similar systems.
[02:34:40.934 --> 02:34:43.176]  They're beta testing separately.
[02:34:43.196 --> 02:34:45.638]  I mean, notice Canada is very hard to get into now.
[02:34:46.078 --> 02:34:50.762]  And they check your political background and yell and scream at you, and it's turning into a giant fortress.
[02:34:51.823 --> 02:34:53.485]  And it has incredible resources.
[02:34:53.585 --> 02:34:53.745]  Alan?
[02:34:54.165 --> 02:35:00.027]  Yes, and in the 70s and 80s when I was over in Europe, I traveled an awful lot through Europe.
[02:35:00.608 --> 02:35:05.149]  What astonished me was that each country had its own little, it was indeed, a little laboratory.
[02:35:05.570 --> 02:35:08.071]  Holland was testing out the reversal of roles.
[02:35:08.131 --> 02:35:12.372]  They paid men to stay at home with the children and paid women to go out to work.
[02:35:13.473 --> 02:35:23.517]  So every country that you went to, Sweden was pushing sex to the extreme to see if they were the first ones who would need partners because sex was so easily available.
[02:35:24.217 --> 02:35:34.481]  And I realized every country was being tested, and now they're using the findings of all these countries to create a global society that brings all the things that work together into one system.
[02:35:34.901 --> 02:35:44.785]  And you research enough of this data, you then come up with a prime projection of exactly what they're doing, and then years later you come across a Rand Corporation or a UN document
[02:35:45.305 --> 02:35:57.816]  And it's like you wrote it, because you know, you're an intellectual, you've studied it, you've looked at it, and then you already know what their plan is, and then you find actual documents where what you know your understanding was a hundred percent.
[02:35:58.176 --> 02:36:08.826]  And there's only a few people, Alan Watt, myself, and really, frankly, Alan, when it comes to the technical side, because you do a lot of research, I do too, a lot of other folks are great patriots, they're just not as bookwormish as we are.
[02:36:09.446 --> 02:36:17.753]  But, I mean, have you had that experience where you know their plan and then later you actually find a document that's word for word what you'd already, with thousands of pieces of data, put together?
[02:36:18.153 --> 02:36:18.454]  Yes.
[02:36:18.634 --> 02:36:24.519]  You find many documents often in the same story, on the same particular area that you're looking into.
[02:36:25.099 --> 02:36:36.429]  And I often say that life is boring because once you've understood and read all their books, you know the implementation scheme, you know where they're going, you're never surprised because you know what the next step and the next step and the next step will be.
[02:36:37.189 --> 02:36:38.070]  Absolutely, Michael.
[02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:38.490]  Thank you.
[02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:40.031]  Dennis in Colorado, and then Sean.
[02:36:40.051 --> 02:36:40.712]  Dennis, one minute.
[02:36:42.233 --> 02:36:42.853]  Yeah, I got it.
[02:36:43.333 --> 02:36:46.015]  Have you heard of Gene Schroeder, out in Campbell, Colorado?
[02:36:46.796 --> 02:36:47.176]  I have.
[02:36:47.476 --> 02:36:48.036]  Refresh me.
[02:36:48.917 --> 02:36:50.698]  Yeah, it's about the war on emergency powers.
[02:36:50.958 --> 02:36:52.099]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:52.259 --> 02:36:53.920]  A decade ago, he put out stuff exposing that.
[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:55.041]  Yeah, we've been under the War Powers Act.
[02:36:55.101 --> 02:36:55.602]  It's true.
[02:36:56.222 --> 02:36:57.203]  Dr. Gene Schroeder.
[02:36:58.744 --> 02:37:02.026]  If that were to be reversed, do you think that would have any effect on the current environment?
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:03.221]  Absolutely.
[02:37:03.241 --> 02:37:07.283]  You know, they operate by their own laws, and so we're operating under a state of emergency.
[02:37:07.303 --> 02:37:07.944]  Alan Watt?
[02:37:08.804 --> 02:37:09.665]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:37:11.046 --> 02:37:20.953]  Again, everything's been published before by people who stumbled across the truth, and you've got to dig up all these books and use them for evidence that this is an agenda, it's a plan.
[02:37:21.333 --> 02:37:22.034]  Here's the proof.
[02:37:22.054 --> 02:37:23.155]  It's all documented.
[02:37:23.975 --> 02:37:27.617]  To show people, at least for those who can get away from television mentality.
[02:37:27.757 --> 02:37:36.042]  Exactly, they beta test it, like they're beta testing in a little over 50 cities I know of right now, making the cities and counties make you register your guns and your ammo.
[02:37:36.522 --> 02:37:39.104]  And then they'll say, oh look, we tested it, it worked great, let's do it everywhere.
[02:37:39.124 --> 02:37:43.386]  You know, they're beta testing one-child policies through cities that tax you if you have kids.
[02:37:43.486 --> 02:37:49.050]  You know, they're beta testing, and then they admit they're beta testing, and the stuff they're beta testing
[02:37:49.730 --> 02:37:52.212]  They're now rolling out in a year or two, not ten years.
[02:37:52.472 --> 02:37:53.733]  Again, it's very fast.
[02:37:53.793 --> 02:37:55.934]  We're like, everything's quickening right now.
[02:37:57.055 --> 02:38:02.079]  Yes, and also too, you have an international association of mayors, for instance.
[02:38:02.159 --> 02:38:04.320]  All the mayors are in touch with mayors across the planet.
[02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:10.204]  National association of governors, county commissioners, city managers, go ahead.
[02:38:10.585 --> 02:38:11.665]  Yeah, police chiefs as well.
[02:38:12.226 --> 02:38:16.369]  And whatever works in one country to an extent, especially if it's profitable to them,
[02:38:17.049 --> 02:38:17.730]  We're good to go.
[02:38:32.470 --> 02:38:32.851]  Exactly.
[02:38:32.911 --> 02:38:34.312]  Let me give you one microcosm.
[02:38:34.352 --> 02:38:35.093]  How do they implement?
[02:38:35.113 --> 02:38:38.155]  They say we got a $787 million stimulus package.
[02:38:38.195 --> 02:38:39.457]  Every other country has a package.
[02:38:39.877 --> 02:38:40.778]  That's taxpayer money.
[02:38:41.058 --> 02:38:45.462]  They then tell a city and a county, do this, adopt these laws, and then we'll give you the money.
[02:38:46.022 --> 02:38:46.203]  Okay?
[02:38:46.223 --> 02:38:48.525]  That's what they call, you know, these funded mandates.
[02:38:50.026 --> 02:38:52.507]  So that's how they have it all unified.
[02:38:52.807 --> 02:39:02.552]  And then privately, insurance companies will say, if you start running checkpoints with the Army at it, or if you start running people through the Patriot Act database to rent a car, we'll give you a discount.
[02:39:02.833 --> 02:39:06.815]  So they incentivize it all, and then have everybody jump through the hoops to do it.
[02:39:06.855 --> 02:39:07.875]  I appreciate your call, Dennis.
[02:39:08.155 --> 02:39:09.616]  Sean in Toronto, last caller.
[02:39:09.636 --> 02:39:13.158]  Yes, hello, Alex and Alan.
[02:39:13.318 --> 02:39:15.979]  I'm glad to finally be on the phone with you.
[02:39:16.099 --> 02:39:18.000]  I just have a comment and then a question.
[02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:19.581]  My comment is this.
[02:39:20.439 --> 02:39:27.544]  I think the most important thing that you've done, Alex, as far as exposure, is the Bohemian Grove.
[02:39:28.204 --> 02:39:43.914]  I think that is far and above the most important thing, because it shows the true level of twisted evil of the most powerful people that are involved in this whole New World Order
[02:39:45.166 --> 02:39:56.173]  Well, Hollywood tells us, I saw The Ninth Gate, I was on the stair-stepper this weekend on cable, and I'd seen it before, so I watched the last hour of it, and what do all these Hollywood movies tell you?
[02:39:56.393 --> 02:40:05.639]  When you go to the big castle chateau in England, or in France, or in New York, you know, eyes wide shut, the elite is engaging in satanic ceremonies.
[02:40:06.079 --> 02:40:11.123]  Well, in real life, that's what they're doing, and why is this, from a sociological perspective, even if you're an atheist,
[02:40:11.943 --> 02:40:21.007]  Because they're psycho-killers, they're going to have a religion that matches their flair for blood and death and torture and the enjoyment of hurting innocents.
[02:40:21.087 --> 02:40:21.567]  Alan, what?
[02:40:22.327 --> 02:40:23.948]  Yes, it is.
[02:40:24.168 --> 02:40:26.609]  They hid themselves, whether they believe in it or not.
[02:40:26.669 --> 02:40:30.851]  Some can believe in it, some don't have to, but they all attend the same kind of orgies, etc.
[02:40:31.838 --> 02:40:35.119]  Well, it's also about how they're radical.
[02:40:35.159 --> 02:40:40.921]  They'll sit there right in front of the police chief with the governor and just sit there and have sex and drink blood and take a baby and...
[02:40:55.754 --> 02:41:00.235]  I've got the physical will and power to kill this little kid!
[02:41:00.375 --> 02:41:01.196]  Satan!
[02:41:01.216 --> 02:41:05.557]  And again, it's all about they've got the willingness to go to this level of darkness.
[02:41:05.837 --> 02:41:06.277]  Alan, why?
[02:41:06.478 --> 02:41:09.459]  What they show to each other is that they have no inhibitions.
[02:41:09.499 --> 02:41:11.439]  That's a must-be to join the Misfite.
[02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:13.960]  You have no inhibitions sexually.
[02:41:13.980 --> 02:41:15.881]  That's for male or female or whatever.
[02:41:16.861 --> 02:41:32.914]  I mean, whatever, and that you're not embarrassed by any, you're not inhibited and embarrassed by any particular situation, so you've got to be almost very ultimately avant-garde in everything that you do amongst your own, to show that you have no inhibitions.
[02:41:33.214 --> 02:41:36.056]  Alright, call or ask your question, because I've really twisted Alan's arm.
[02:41:36.096 --> 02:41:36.597]  Go ahead.
[02:41:36.837 --> 02:41:39.259]  Alright, the one question I had was this.
[02:41:41.184 --> 02:41:41.404]  No.
[02:41:41.424 --> 02:41:41.524]  No.
[02:41:56.306 --> 02:42:02.008]  Have any evidence or knowledge that that type of thing is happening up here?
[02:42:02.488 --> 02:42:02.988]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:42:03.008 --> 02:42:08.570]  Sir, it's been in the Toronto Star that they've built FEMA camps and they had the... In Canada?
[02:42:09.190 --> 02:42:21.294]  Yeah, they had generals in like ten mainstream articles a week ago, it was like more than ten, saying we're going to patrol the streets, we're going to do cordons, we're preparing to lock down Canadian cities and put people in camps.
[02:42:21.314 --> 02:42:22.154]  I'm going to let you go there.
[02:42:22.194 --> 02:42:23.514]  I know Alan's always informed.
[02:42:23.894 --> 02:42:25.275]  Alan, you saw the articles, I'm sure.
[02:42:25.775 --> 02:42:31.978]  Yes, and I also know that many of the closed bases are still attended and kept up to scratch with empty beds.
[02:42:33.179 --> 02:42:35.960]  And I know where they are, too, even Ontario and different places in Canada.
[02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:38.862]  And that again is for emergency purposes.
[02:42:39.462 --> 02:42:41.483]  Yeah, they broke Canada in five parts.
[02:42:42.063 --> 02:42:44.504]  It was in a bunch of Canadian papers.
[02:42:44.925 --> 02:42:46.325]  In fact, let me give people the exact headline.
[02:42:46.345 --> 02:42:47.266]  We'll pull this up at the end.
[02:42:48.546 --> 02:42:50.087]  Exact headline, there were so many.
[02:42:50.247 --> 02:42:52.829]  Let me think, one was Toronto Star, there were some other ones.
[02:42:57.163 --> 02:43:02.845]  Military to take lead role in Canada emergencies.
[02:43:04.166 --> 02:43:05.606]  Military to take lead role.
[02:43:05.646 --> 02:43:09.108]  Another one was military to patrol Rowdy Bar District.
[02:43:09.708 --> 02:43:12.369]  That was in Barrie, Ontario, and that's correct.
[02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:13.369]  That's what they're doing.
[02:43:13.449 --> 02:43:14.310]  Alright, let me pull up more.
[02:43:14.330 --> 02:43:14.630]  Hold on.
[02:43:19.508 --> 02:43:24.495]  United States, Mexico, Canada sign agreement to share forces during disasters.
[02:43:24.556 --> 02:43:26.759]  And it said that we use each other's troops, each other's countries.
[02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:29.082]  I mean, there's many others, folks.
[02:43:30.044 --> 02:43:31.125]  But there you have it.
[02:43:31.526 --> 02:43:32.607]  Alan Wan, in closing,
[02:43:35.433 --> 02:43:36.774]  What do the elite think of you and I?
[02:43:36.794 --> 02:43:40.037]  I mean, I know I've talked to some of them and they've laughed and said, look, the public's scum.
[02:43:40.057 --> 02:43:40.857]  They want to be destroyed.
[02:43:40.917 --> 02:43:41.878]  Let them, you know, join us.
[02:43:41.918 --> 02:43:42.439]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:43:42.459 --> 02:43:44.060]  I mean, that's kind of the attitude.
[02:43:45.261 --> 02:43:48.003]  You can't, you know, evil knows it can wreck things, break things.
[02:43:48.043 --> 02:43:54.908]  He doesn't have to keep all the plates piled up, you know, in a juggling act where you've got a hundred plates in your hands and teacups.
[02:43:55.829 --> 02:43:58.732]  They're very puzzled by us because they can't imagine anyone doing something
[02:44:17.703 --> 02:44:20.589]  Uh, where there's no personal benefit involved whatsoever.
[02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:21.791]  Because they live.
[02:44:21.811 --> 02:44:24.136]  That's also the Achilles heel.
[02:44:24.577 --> 02:44:27.883]  Each one of the helpers for the elite has a personal benefit.
[02:44:27.923 --> 02:44:29.627]  They're in it for a gain, personally.
[02:44:30.618 --> 02:44:34.302]  And if it's underhanded or crooked, they don't care.
[02:44:34.322 --> 02:44:36.965]  They think that everyone is the same as themselves.
[02:44:37.025 --> 02:44:47.916]  And so when someone comes along and does something for some other purpose, or says it's for a moral purpose or whatever, you're genuinely a puzzle to them because they cannot relate to you at all.
[02:44:49.017 --> 02:44:49.357]  At all.
[02:44:50.178 --> 02:44:53.642]  And if you know your stuff and you know what it's all about, what's going on,
[02:44:54.631 --> 02:45:02.914]  They would like to recruit you and they cannot understand why you won't take the payoff or the bait or whatever and be one of them and live the high life.
[02:45:04.035 --> 02:45:05.395]  Which is actually in prison.
[02:45:05.715 --> 02:45:07.036]  I mean, it's a treasure.
[02:45:07.076 --> 02:45:16.300]  It's so valuable to tie into the life force of the universe, to literally be involved, realizing I'm going to live forever through my progeny, even if my progeny, my line ends.
[02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:21.642]  I live through humanity and I imagine us, you know, really in this cocoon stage,
[02:45:22.242 --> 02:45:26.785]  For what humanity could develop into if we're given time and don't let these elite backstabbers.
[02:45:27.025 --> 02:45:28.065]  To me it's very evil.
[02:45:28.286 --> 02:45:30.307]  They claim they're elite to suppress and dumb down.
[02:45:30.327 --> 02:45:36.510]  And, you know, I love seeing others do well and maximizing beauty and intelligence and honor and potential.
[02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:37.831]  And I love innocence.
[02:45:38.332 --> 02:45:44.655]  And they love destruction and power and all the, you know, and indoctrinating the troops into killing a million, three hundred thousand Iraqis.
[02:45:44.995 --> 02:45:47.037]  You know, they love these rituals of destruction.
[02:45:47.777 --> 02:45:52.241]  And I see them destroying their own soul and attacking the very heart of humanity.
[02:45:52.801 --> 02:46:00.968]  And so I'm into the species surviving, having a chance to decide what the species wants to become, in elevating enlightenment.
[02:46:01.528 --> 02:46:06.652]  And so I don't care if they kill me, because I know I live on and my only... I'm worried about the species.
[02:46:06.732 --> 02:46:12.157]  I'm worried about the species merging with technology too quickly, losing what our true potential was.
[02:46:12.637 --> 02:46:21.620]  And so I'm almost like a conservator who wants to keep these great works of art alive because they are alive and will grow into something even greater.
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:27.523]  I'm like someone trying to maintain the original seeds so they can be planted.
[02:46:27.543 --> 02:46:28.163]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:46:28.823 --> 02:46:31.625]  Yes, and evil itself can give you nothing but evil.
[02:46:31.665 --> 02:46:32.886]  That's the key to it as well.
[02:46:33.407 --> 02:46:34.908]  Nothing good will come out of this.
[02:46:35.128 --> 02:46:38.691]  That's an old, old debate in different religions.
[02:46:38.711 --> 02:46:39.912]  Can good come out of evil?
[02:46:40.272 --> 02:46:41.833]  And technically, no, it cannot.
[02:46:42.434 --> 02:46:48.418]  Evil can only spawn more evil and cruelty and hatred and disgust at their own actions.
[02:46:49.459 --> 02:46:51.621]  So this is the ultimate battle.
[02:46:51.681 --> 02:46:56.745]  Really, it's your soul that's after that thing which makes you individualistically you.
[02:46:57.578 --> 02:46:58.358]  That's what they're after.
[02:46:58.378 --> 02:47:00.419]  They don't like the unknown factor.
[02:47:00.459 --> 02:47:06.781]  They want a bunch of peapod clones walking around the planet serving them that are perfectly predictable.
[02:47:07.501 --> 02:47:08.782]  And that is evil.
[02:47:08.842 --> 02:47:12.123]  It is stunting and blunting destiny.
[02:47:12.563 --> 02:47:13.463]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:47:14.164 --> 02:47:16.764]  See, their heaven, their utopia is our hell.
[02:47:17.385 --> 02:47:18.125]  That's the bottom line.
[02:47:18.908 --> 02:47:21.469]  Well, Alan Watt, tell folks how they can support you.
[02:47:21.549 --> 02:47:25.490]  They can go to CutIntoTheMatrix.com, buy some of the books and videos there.
[02:47:25.850 --> 02:47:30.511]  Just unsurpassed research and work, and we want to thank you for joining us for two and a half hours today.
[02:47:30.851 --> 02:47:31.872]  It's been a pleasure, Alex.
[02:47:32.852 --> 02:47:34.092]  Plug yourself, you never will.
[02:47:34.152 --> 02:47:36.053]  Just tell folks some of the things you've got for sale.
[02:47:36.393 --> 02:47:44.155]  Yes, I've got books on decoding psycholinguistics to show you how we're mocked all the time by very intelligent people.
[02:47:45.015 --> 02:47:48.256]  And you can also buy the discs I have for sale.
[02:47:49.116 --> 02:47:53.218]  And you can listen to my show at night on the other radio broadcasting network.
[02:47:53.878 --> 02:47:55.279]  I wonder if they'll plug me over there.
[02:47:55.359 --> 02:47:56.159]  I'm just joking.
[02:47:56.199 --> 02:47:56.879]  Hey, it doesn't matter.
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:59.821]  You're doing important work and that's what matters.
[02:48:00.161 --> 02:48:02.942]  Alan Watt, I want to thank you so much again for spending time with us.
[02:48:02.962 --> 02:48:05.763]  You'll be on with Jason Burmess 9 to midnight Wednesday, right?
[02:48:05.783 --> 02:48:06.383]  That's confirmed?
[02:48:06.403 --> 02:48:06.824]  That's right, yeah.
[02:48:06.864 --> 02:48:08.204]  You're going to be on the first hour.
[02:48:08.524 --> 02:48:09.985]  Alan Watt, thank you for all the time.
[02:48:10.005 --> 02:48:10.845]  Good to have you on with us.
[02:48:11.045 --> 02:48:11.906]  It's good to be on, Alex.
[02:48:12.766 --> 02:48:14.147]  Alright, great guy there, folks.
[02:48:14.887 --> 02:48:16.228]  That's why I have him on and promoting.
[02:48:18.815 --> 02:48:24.001]  Literally, ladies and gentlemen, you know, I'm an adult.
[02:48:24.301 --> 02:48:26.524]  I've stored up more knowledge than, say, a five-year-old.
[02:48:30.268 --> 02:48:36.355]  And I have done the research.
[02:48:40.737 --> 02:48:42.218]  And the elite are like adults.
[02:48:42.478 --> 02:48:43.798]  They are just more advanced.
[02:48:44.438 --> 02:48:46.079]  They understand how things work.
[02:48:46.819 --> 02:48:52.301]  And they have tried to keep the people in like a perpetual... I think there's still a line connected, folks.
[02:48:52.361 --> 02:48:54.842]  I'm hearing... Can we let the phone system down, please?
[02:48:55.102 --> 02:48:55.382]  Thank you.
[02:48:56.203 --> 02:48:56.443]  Thank you.
[02:48:56.463 --> 02:48:57.623]  I heard some bumping around going on there.
[02:48:58.884 --> 02:48:59.204]  Let me go back.
[02:48:59.244 --> 02:49:00.184]  This is a key thought, okay?
[02:49:00.204 --> 02:49:03.666]  I want to realize that this is what it's... This is what is at my heart of hearts.
[02:49:03.686 --> 02:49:09.868]  And we're going to go back to rebroadcast with the Kevin Booth, CIA drug dealing report, and then the police report, and the military spying on us, and all the rest of it.
[02:49:12.156 --> 02:49:15.558]  At my core, at my very heart, it's like this.
[02:49:15.819 --> 02:49:17.099]  I'm 35 years old.
[02:49:17.540 --> 02:49:18.540]  I have accrued knowledge.
[02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:20.902]  It's advancing exponentially every week now.
[02:49:20.922 --> 02:49:30.729]  I look with marvel at how ignorant and shuttered and uninformed and awake I was, say, 15 years ago when I was more advanced than most adults then.
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:36.182]  And I think of the potential I could grow into for all my problems and foibles.
[02:49:36.282 --> 02:49:37.983]  And then I want to see others do well.
[02:49:38.443 --> 02:49:43.807]  And I have a love affair with creativity and beauty and goodness.
[02:49:45.748 --> 02:49:47.309]  And wanting to lift people up.
[02:49:48.509 --> 02:49:51.631]  And because I know I'm connected to the species and the whole universe.
[02:49:51.811 --> 02:49:54.913]  Whether you're black, white, German, Jewish, Chinese, doesn't matter.
[02:49:55.293 --> 02:49:56.054]  I understand that.
[02:49:56.074 --> 02:49:57.395]  I understand the systems of control.
[02:49:58.686 --> 02:50:05.731]  And so I don't get on a power trip because, you know, there's a five-year-old kid walking down the street and drive by and go, I know more than that five-year-old.
[02:50:05.771 --> 02:50:11.035]  Boy, I could sucker that five-year-old with candy, you know, and get him in the car and go hurt him.
[02:50:11.496 --> 02:50:19.421]  Or I could go sucker some 18-year-old chick and boss her around and pamper her around and, you know, that's what... But see, that's how criminals think.
[02:50:19.862 --> 02:50:21.263]  That's how criminals operate.
[02:50:21.283 --> 02:50:22.824]  That's how psychopaths operate.
[02:50:23.084 --> 02:50:25.086]  They love tricking a little kid to get in a car with them.
[02:50:25.666 --> 02:50:34.692]  You know, I would love to be able to educate a five-year-old, to build them up, to make them strong, to teach them the pitfalls that I didn't learn when I was young, so they could avoid all of that.
[02:50:34.712 --> 02:50:35.832]  I want to give them revelation.
[02:50:35.852 --> 02:50:36.833]  I want to give them knowledge.
[02:50:37.073 --> 02:50:41.276]  See, God wants to give us, the little commoners, the little, you know, people, that as well.
[02:50:42.036 --> 02:50:45.439]  And Satan, the New World Order, claims they're giving us all this knowledge.
[02:50:45.499 --> 02:50:46.019]  No, they don't.
[02:50:46.439 --> 02:50:51.783]  All they do is actually suppress knowledge, destroy people, manipulate our basic instincts against ourselves.
[02:50:52.603 --> 02:50:53.467]  And you don't believe in the devil?
[02:50:53.507 --> 02:50:54.129]  Whatever, fine.
[02:50:54.310 --> 02:50:56.879]  The group consciousness of evil people.
[02:50:57.361 --> 02:50:58.846]  Or the group works they create.
[02:51:00.222 --> 02:51:01.462]  And so that's what it comes down to.
[02:51:01.622 --> 02:51:02.983]  I want to empower people.
[02:51:03.083 --> 02:51:06.924]  I'm not on a power trip when some neighbor of mine is ignorant.
[02:51:07.064 --> 02:51:09.064]  They may be 50 years old and don't know how the world works.
[02:51:09.164 --> 02:51:15.486]  I don't... I see people that, you know, whenever they... a lot of people when they teach you something or tell you you're wrong, they revel in it like their ego.
[02:51:15.886 --> 02:51:18.627]  No, I'm actually embarrassed for somebody when they don't know something.
[02:51:18.647 --> 02:51:20.368]  And I'm embarrassed for myself when I don't know something.
[02:51:20.668 --> 02:51:22.508]  And I want to empower them with knowledge.
[02:51:22.548 --> 02:51:25.349]  I want to... I want to commune with them mentally.
[02:51:25.709 --> 02:51:27.112]  Psychologically, spiritually.
[02:51:27.493 --> 02:51:29.697]  I want to lift them up and then lift me up together.
[02:51:29.757 --> 02:51:31.300]  Rising tide raises all ships.
[02:51:33.565 --> 02:51:34.326]  I want to build.
[02:51:35.880 --> 02:51:42.225]  And I want to increase the goodness and increase the knowledge and there's nothing we can't do.
[02:51:42.245 --> 02:51:45.268]  I mean, we are made in the image of the creator of the universe, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:45.568 --> 02:51:47.870]  And the globalists know that and they're very jealous and envious of that.
[02:51:47.890 --> 02:51:57.398]  They want to hoard that knowledge for themselves and make themselves gods, they believe, instead of trying to empower everybody and moving towards what humanity is going to become if they don't stop us.
[02:51:58.587 --> 02:52:12.871]  And so, the New World Order's like somebody pulling over in their car, tricking a five-year-old in the car, and then taking them to an abandoned shack and beating their brains out, and then reveling, I have power, this five-year-old's tied down, I can beat him in the head with a hammer, man, I've got power!
[02:52:15.491 --> 02:52:17.472]  I mean, it is sick!
[02:52:19.235 --> 02:52:20.536]  It is sick beyond belief.
[02:52:20.916 --> 02:52:23.797]  I've got to go, my board office has got to go because they're running Burma's 9 to midnight tonight.
[02:52:24.437 --> 02:52:28.599]  The Obama deception is being censored off the number one viewed page at YouTube and Google.
[02:52:28.619 --> 02:52:29.319]  Why is that important?
[02:52:29.339 --> 02:52:30.460]  Because it's on the front page.
[02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:35.122]  We don't just get the choir or people you pass the video on to in emails or at work.
[02:52:35.222 --> 02:52:38.704]  We get the masses, the millions that are on the main front page every day.
[02:52:38.964 --> 02:52:39.664]  They've been caught.
[02:52:39.704 --> 02:52:41.085]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:52:41.125 --> 02:52:47.828]  We want to counter them by emailing it out to everybody, Myspacing it, pushing it like you've never pushed it before.
[02:52:47.888 --> 02:52:48.448]  Please help us.
[02:52:48.928 --> 02:52:59.277]  Please help us get this out, or buy the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it online at super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, but get that high quality, because there's all these crud copies out there.
[02:53:00.037 --> 02:53:02.960]  This is the high quality copy.
[02:53:02.980 --> 02:53:05.522]  The best we've seen online for free at YouTube.
[02:53:05.542 --> 02:53:06.103]  Change your channel.
[02:53:06.123 --> 02:53:08.224]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now.

[02:53:13.287 --> 02:53:13.627]  Central.
[02:53:13.927 --> 02:53:17.529]  We did five hours, one minute, and 20 seconds live today.
[02:53:17.569 --> 02:53:18.569]  Great job to the crew.
[02:53:19.049 --> 02:53:21.370]  I'm Alex Jones in the Info War for Humanity.
[02:53:22.170 --> 02:53:33.595]  Kamikazing right into the Death Star of the New World Order in an attempt to ignite the minds of men and women towards liberty and freedom upward and ever onward in this great experiment we call life.
[02:53:34.275 --> 02:53:35.436]  God bless you all.
