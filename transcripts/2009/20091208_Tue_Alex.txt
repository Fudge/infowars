[00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:08.605]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:10.086]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.787]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:16.089]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.691]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:25.274]  It is Tuesday, the eighth day of December 2009.
[00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:29.536]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:41.800]  Lord Christopher Monckton will be joining us from day two of the Copenhagen World Government Establishment Summit that is going on.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.407]  We'll be covering all the latest developments with the climate gate fraud and another huge development today.
[00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:55.192]  Copenhagen Climate Summit in disarray after Danish techs leak
[00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.495]  They told the third world they were going to be given all this money from the global taxes.
[00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:03.538]  Turns out it's all going to go to private central banks.
[00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.520]  That was in the treaty.
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.543]  That's what the big banks have been saying they were going to set up for at least 20 years.
[00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:12.784]  But this is new news to the world.
[00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:19.849]  Now the summit's in even more trouble because the third world is finding out it's a screw job to shut down their industry.
[00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:24.953]  They were sold by the same IMF and World Bank that have been robbing them for more than half a century.
[00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:29.874]  That this was going to empower them and that this was going to be a new tax on the West.
[00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:35.415]  No, it's actually a tax by Western banks on them and on the people of the West.
[00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:37.136]  This is a huge new development.
[00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:40.697]  Also investigative journalist at the London Telegraph.
[00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:49.939]  Climategate, Barack Obama's rule by EPA decree is a coup d'etat against Congress made in Britain.
[00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:52.409]  That is the headline.
[00:01:52.449 --> 00:02:08.198]  Governor Jesse Ventura, fresh off the premiere of his television show last Wednesday, to record all-time ratings on True TV, formerly Court TV, will be joining us to talk about a host of issues until the bottom of the hour.
[00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:16.443]  Then Lord Christopher Monckton coming up in the second hour today from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:19.685]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us.
[00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:36.952]  For that, this is going to be extremely informative and I'm lining up a bunch of other reporters to be on with us this week and next week in the two week long summit or roughly two weeks was a 13 day long summit being held in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:40.534]  So that is all coming up today as well.
[00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:48.382]  Also, more on Senate Leader Harry Reid comparing opponents of health care reform to supporters of slavery.
[00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:50.284]  You don't like socialist government?
[00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:51.686]  You're a racist.
[00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:52.366]  It's the N-word.
[00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:53.928]  Has nothing to do with it.
[00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:55.730]  They just inject that in there.
[00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:12.342]  When this is actually government slavery making you buy insurance, making you have more money taken out of your taxes for this whole eugenics soft kill program that is modern health care and with a 41 billion dollar cut a year in Medicare alone.
[00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:21.845]  That the Democrats have stripped out of Medicaid and Medicare, even more than 41 billion total, just 41 billion with Medicare alone.
[00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:30.668]  So they're the ones actually raising taxes, cutting services, while meanwhile invoking race cards and slavery.
[00:03:31.468 --> 00:03:32.629]  Again, they're race pimps.
[00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.632]  They use race as a tool of division.
[00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:39.373]  We're going to be breaking that down today as well.
[00:03:39.894 --> 00:03:42.355]  Also, I've gotten some emails of people in denial.
[00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:46.698]  We have confirmed that around the country, gun shops, Walmart,
[00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:55.980]  Gun shows are demanding social security numbers and ID cards that they scan or record to get into gun shows.
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.541]  And some gun shows are just getting the last four digits.
[00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:02.902]  Yes, that is really going on and we're investigating that as well.
[00:04:03.563 --> 00:04:06.404]  Very, very serious because it's being done outside of the law.
[00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:14.827]  It's being done literally just as a form of intimidation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
[00:04:16.232 --> 00:04:22.859]  And now explosives, they're always changing their name as they run around the nation basically intimidating people.
[00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:37.574]  But when we get back from break, Governor Jesse Ventura will be on with us to talk about the huge success of his number one TV show, number one on true TV, part two airing 10 p.m.
[00:04:37.774 --> 00:04:38.154]  Eastern
[00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:42.077]  Tomorrow night on TruTV.
[00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:46.400]  We'll talk about the upcoming episodes as well and a lot more.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.704]  His last interview, he's doing it with us before he leaves to Mexico for a few weeks of surfing.
[00:04:53.044 --> 00:04:54.605]  I bet he wishes he was in Hawaii.
[00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:56.927]  They're recording record waves there right now.
[00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.631]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:07.995]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:10.096]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:15.220]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.381]  How much do you want?
[00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:17.342]  When do you want it?
[00:05:17.722 --> 00:05:19.323]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:19.603 --> 00:05:20.424]  When will you need it?
[00:05:20.684 --> 00:05:22.746]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:23.987]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.227 --> 00:05:25.528]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:25.828 --> 00:05:30.814]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:30.994 --> 00:05:34.198]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:34.598 --> 00:05:38.022]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.342 --> 00:05:39.323]  How much will you need?
[00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:40.184]  We don't know.
[00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.386]  How much do you want?
[00:05:41.586 --> 00:05:42.307]  All you can get.
[00:05:42.507 --> 00:05:42.968]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:43.588 --> 00:05:43.808]  I think.
[00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:04.078]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:06.141]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:06:06.301 --> 00:06:08.584]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:10.607]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:12.389]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:13.691]  There is a solution.
[00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:21.915]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.802]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:07:02.902 --> 00:07:05.644]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:07:05.784 --> 00:07:07.024]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:07:07.044 --> 00:07:07.745]  It's very real.
[00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:09.986]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:11.627]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:16.069]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:18.611]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:24.596]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:07:24.817 --> 00:07:29.541]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:32.343]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:07:32.443 --> 00:07:35.066]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:36.507]  This system is free of chemicals.
[00:07:36.527 --> 00:07:37.027]  I think so.
[00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.863]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:07.469]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:28.751]  Well, I am again honored to have a former Minnesota governor, movie star, top wrestler, best-selling author, XFL and NFL commentator, and so much more, Governor Jesse Ventura with us until the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:35.416]  Lord Christopher Monckton joining us coming up 52 minutes from now from the Copenhagen Global Government Summit.
[00:08:35.856 --> 00:08:40.480]  But I wanted to get the governor on and luckily I caught him because this is his last interview.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.822]  He is leaving
[00:08:43.442 --> 00:08:44.442]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:44.662]  Hopefully.
[00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:49.384]  Actually, I'm not leaving within the next 24, but I would tell you it will be within the next week.
[00:09:06.872 --> 00:09:07.892]  Well, I don't know.
[00:09:07.932 --> 00:09:13.573]  Maybe she's going to pack me up and we'll be out of here tonight.
[00:09:13.693 --> 00:09:14.174]  I don't know.
[00:09:14.994 --> 00:09:17.414]  They're usually in charge.
[00:09:31.314 --> 00:09:41.162]  Well, it did well, you know, considering all the options out there, Alex, and that there's, you know, literally hundreds of stations that a viewer has to choose from.
[00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:48.468]  They couldn't be happier, I couldn't be happier, and I want to thank your listeners and that, because they're certainly a part of it now.
[00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:53.972]  The key now is to keep the momentum rolling, and hopefully the show will grow.
[00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:57.695]  Hopefully word of mouth will get out there, and there is a buzz, believe it.
[00:09:58.266 --> 00:09:59.126]  We're good to go.
[00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:36.884]  Authority, which is good, in my opinion, and to hopefully get more people involved in the process and wake the lemmings up a little bit.
[00:10:37.824 --> 00:10:39.405]  So, did you lose the bet?
[00:10:39.425 --> 00:10:46.651]  I mean, you betted that the show wouldn't air with your crew, or your crew... I happily lost the bet.
[00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:54.897]  It was a gentleman's bet, so of course there was nothing involved, no material or monetary involvement, but I happily lost the bet.
[00:10:55.037 --> 00:10:55.898]  I never thought
[00:10:57.213 --> 00:11:02.196]  I thought at the 11th hour, someone would come in and pull the plug on this project.
[00:11:02.716 --> 00:11:03.516]  They have not.
[00:11:03.736 --> 00:11:06.438]  The first one aired, of course, on Harp last week.
[00:11:06.898 --> 00:11:09.759]  Tomorrow night should be on the infamous 9-11.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.702]  And, you know, again, I defend myself by saying this.
[00:11:15.503 --> 00:11:28.242]  I went out and spoke to three different people who were all at the site when it happened, and within that day, the other gentleman spent 256 consecutive days there working.
[00:11:29.782 --> 00:11:35.766]  All of these interviews I do with these people tell a far different story than what the government told us.
[00:11:36.307 --> 00:11:40.169]  Now, you then ask yourself the question, who do you want to believe?
[00:11:40.589 --> 00:11:45.533]  Do you want to believe the government bureaucracy and the bureaucrats in Washington that weren't there?
[00:11:46.013 --> 00:11:57.161]  Or do you want to believe three people who were hands-on, two of them surviving the attack, and the other one starting that very day to spend 256 consecutive days at the site?
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.861]  Who do you want to believe?
[00:12:01.302 --> 00:12:08.849]  Well, I'll unequivocally state that I believe the people I talk to.
[00:12:10.351 --> 00:12:16.938]  And I don't want to tip the show off completely, so that's why I'm kind of talking in generalities and not naming names.
[00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:29.103]  Sure, well I, you know, have got a large idea of... I mean, I know the inside baseball and I think people are going to be amazed when they see this tomorrow night.
[00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:32.705]  A lot of people couldn't believe this would go on mainstream television.
[00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:36.528]  They couldn't believe that you would go on and do the Harp Special.
[00:12:37.148 --> 00:12:46.994]  And that it would be basically all from our perspective, our point of view, because the other side was so secretive and, you know, covered up what was really going on.
[00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:48.655]  People are really amazed.
[00:12:48.715 --> 00:12:53.498]  This is a watershed event to have the pro-conspiracy view shown.
[00:12:53.538 --> 00:12:56.160]  But as you said, you just went out and searched for the truth.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:02.683]  And you've shared with me your view on what you think the most powerful
[00:13:03.644 --> 00:13:05.685]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[00:13:05.705 --> 00:13:17.409]  The scariest of the seven episodes, in my opinion, is 2012.
[00:13:19.669 --> 00:13:20.710]  And I'll leave it at that.
[00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.570]  That's the scariest one.
[00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:30.293]  The most bizarre one, in my opinion, and again, this is just my opinion, is the Manchurian Candidate episode.
[00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:49.814]  You know, Alex, throwing everything aside, the shows are going to be very entertaining, they're going to be informative, and if people even choose not to believe them, they certainly will be frightened by the shows, because if they are true, it is frightening.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.562]  Yeah, that's what the great thing was about doing these shows.
[00:13:54.642 --> 00:14:02.405]  And again, I'm amazed that they're on the air, but you know, maybe they just think that I don't have the credibility anymore.
[00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:04.586]  Maybe they just think that it'll be meaningless.
[00:14:04.646 --> 00:14:09.868]  But the other reason I'm glad they're on the air is a hundred years from now,
[00:14:10.698 --> 00:14:19.445]  I hope that people, when they look back and study about now, will realize that not all of us believed what the government said on things.
[00:14:19.906 --> 00:14:23.609]  Not all of us were of the same opinion as the official story.
[00:14:24.424 --> 00:14:30.747]  And I think that's very important because to every story there's going to be multiple sides to it.
[00:14:31.107 --> 00:14:33.428]  And those multiple sides need to be heard.
[00:14:33.868 --> 00:14:36.509]  And fortunately now we've got it on the record.
[00:14:36.569 --> 00:14:46.953]  If these seven shows air, there will at least be some type of something on the record, pretty predominantly, that indicates that not everybody believed the status quo.
[00:14:48.234 --> 00:14:52.736]  Well, just to be clear, I have had a chance to
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:15:05.803]  Discover what is contained in tomorrow night's 9-11 show and I this is the one episode that I Personally thought would probably not air and it still hasn't aired.
[00:15:06.224 --> 00:15:09.585]  We'll see what Obviously transpires tomorrow at 10 p.m.
[00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:20.648]  Eastern 9 p.m Central but clearly I know a lot of people in the production crew and I know talking to you and others I mean
[00:15:21.648 --> 00:15:29.471]  The 9-11 show, I think, is the strongest and is extremely groundbreaking and powerful.
[00:15:29.852 --> 00:15:35.534]  The information that is going to be aired for the first time in a fair way on national television.
[00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:42.345]  Well, you know, I've seen it, and I stand by everything we did on it.
[00:15:43.326 --> 00:15:45.167]  I'm proud of the fact that we did it.
[00:15:46.628 --> 00:15:50.812]  You know, I'm of the believer that dissension's the greatest form of patriotism.
[00:15:50.892 --> 00:16:06.003]  I say that as often as I can, because, you know, I'm a sucker for honesty, and I'm a sucker for the truth, and I try to turn over everything I can to learn it when I think that there's something suspicious.
[00:16:06.815 --> 00:16:09.297]  You know, bottom line for me, Alex, is this.
[00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:14.723]  We're a country that runs by the rule of law, or at least we're supposed to.
[00:16:15.764 --> 00:16:22.570]  And if you follow that rule of law, you have to follow it when it's convenient as well as when it's inconvenient.
[00:16:23.251 --> 00:16:30.358]  And I question the fact that why, how can we convict someone before we've even indicted them?
[00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:37.540]  It runs contrary to everything this country stands for, yet people are accepting this.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.950]  And what I'm saying is, Osama bin Laden, why has he never been indicted for 9-11?
[00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:53.436]  Why haven't the government convened a grand jury, presented evidence enough to the grand jury, which is us citizens, for us to bring down an indictment?
[00:16:53.496 --> 00:16:54.957]  It happened eight years ago.
[00:16:55.497 --> 00:16:59.940]  Why hasn't that procedure been followed in our rule of law?
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:08.045]  Just like the other day, I was watching these hearings where that Senator Graham was grilling Holder, the Attorney General,
[00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:14.876]  And he asked Holder, he said, if hypothetically you caught Bin Laden tomorrow, would you read him Miranda?
[00:17:15.677 --> 00:17:18.280]  And here the Attorney General hems and haws.
[00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:23.265]  I would have looked at that senator and said, absolutely you read him Miranda.
[00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:25.147]  It's the rule of the land.
[00:17:26.108 --> 00:17:27.109]  It's our laws.
[00:17:27.734 --> 00:17:31.940]  You can't just ignore the law because you choose to.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:39.711]  And then I would have looked at that Senator Graham and said, well, Senator, is it you who decides who Miranda gets read to?
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.260]  Come on!
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.841]  That's the rule of our land!
[00:17:43.861 --> 00:17:47.802]  Charles Manson got Miranda read to him, Alex!
[00:17:48.543 --> 00:17:49.083]  Absolutely.
[00:17:49.123 --> 00:17:57.266]  Well, you've also made the point in national television interviews that six of the ten commissioners say the 9-11 investigation was a fraud, a cover-up.
[00:17:57.606 --> 00:18:06.389]  Farmer, the head lawyer, has got a book coming out saying it was all a criminal cover-up, that the Pentagon was lying, that they agreed day one to lie to the public.
[00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:19.114]  I mean, you've got to have your head screwed on backwards to not call for a true independent investigation and to have the media call us kooks for simply listening to what the 9-11 Commission is saying.
[00:18:19.675 --> 00:18:20.435]  That's a fraud.
[00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:23.736]  And then we have Khalid Sheikh Mohammed held for eight years.
[00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.557]  They threatened to torture his kids.
[00:18:25.817 --> 00:18:28.979]  He confessed to everything but killing Kennedy and Lincoln.
[00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:34.441]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till three years after he was already arrested.
[00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:39.004]  Well, Alex, I don't know about that.
[00:18:39.124 --> 00:18:43.126]  I'm not that deep into that knowledge, but I'll take your word on it.
[00:18:44.366 --> 00:18:46.507]  You know, well, exactly.
[00:18:46.927 --> 00:18:54.110]  And you start looking at this evidence and analyzing it, and it just doesn't add up.
[00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.851]  And yet, we're attacked.
[00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.432]  We're told we're unpatriotic.
[00:18:59.852 --> 00:19:00.573]  Because what?
[00:19:00.633 --> 00:19:01.413]  We question?
[00:19:02.478 --> 00:19:16.448]  And what's interesting, and I will say this about the 9-11 show, bear in mind the show starts off with me meeting a 9-11 person who lost her daughter, who was pregnant with their grandchild.
[00:19:16.828 --> 00:19:17.568]  Oh, it's powerful.
[00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:21.651]  And she's appealing to me to seek the truth.
[00:19:22.091 --> 00:19:24.433]  Well, I'll tell you what, that's good enough for me.
[00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:31.558]  Yeah, I think... That one mother who appealed to me is good enough for me to go out and ask some questions.
[00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.890]  No, it's extremely powerful, folks.
[00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.511]  We're not gonna... We're not gonna let the cat out of the bag.
[00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.251]  Just watch tomorrow night, 10 p.m.
[00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:39.851]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:19:39.892 --> 00:19:40.352]  Central.
[00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:41.812]  TruTV.
[00:19:42.572 --> 00:19:45.012]  It's on cable, DirecTV, Dish, everywhere.
[00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:46.413]  Definitely.
[00:19:46.433 --> 00:19:51.274]  And I've talked to a lot of people who got their... Alex, before you let me go, bring me back.
[00:19:51.394 --> 00:19:54.054]  I want to give one comment on the global warming.
[00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:55.515]  Oh, yeah.
[00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:56.155]  Absolutely, sir.
[00:19:56.175 --> 00:19:57.315]  We've got you to the bottom of the hour.
[00:19:57.355 --> 00:19:57.655]  Stay there.
[00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:00.082]  Hello.
[00:20:00.403 --> 00:20:04.813]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:20:05.154 --> 00:20:07.440]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most
[00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:14.783]  What do you have to say about the wild food experience?
[00:20:14.963 --> 00:20:19.847]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[00:20:20.148 --> 00:20:21.109]  Boy, was I wrong.
[00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:24.551]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[00:20:24.572 --> 00:20:28.375]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:31.397]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[00:20:31.638 --> 00:20:32.018]  Wow!
[00:20:32.178 --> 00:20:33.419]  I watched the DVD last night.
[00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:34.800]  I was awestruck.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.442]  What wonderful work you have done.
[00:20:36.622 --> 00:20:38.784]  This information can bless many people.
[00:20:39.224 --> 00:20:40.205]  Thank you again.
[00:20:40.325 --> 00:20:40.906]  Thanks again!
[00:20:41.086 --> 00:20:43.969]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:44.589]  Thank you.
[00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.813]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[00:20:59.847 --> 00:21:01.868]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.028 --> 00:21:02.829]  Spy on me?
[00:21:02.889 --> 00:21:03.169]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.209 --> 00:21:08.111]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.252 --> 00:21:09.712]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:10.533]  Startpage?
[00:21:10.633 --> 00:21:10.973]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:12.034]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.134 --> 00:21:14.955]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.095 --> 00:21:18.817]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:21.839]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:24.440]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.180]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:26.540]  Right!
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.621]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:30.461]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:30.501 --> 00:21:31.461]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:35.382]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:35.702 --> 00:21:39.323]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:39.483 --> 00:21:44.444]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.

[00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:55.688]  That's StartPage.com
[00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:09.378]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:09.658 --> 00:22:15.702]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:16.102 --> 00:22:24.948]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:25.328 --> 00:22:34.240]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.106]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:39.387 --> 00:22:40.668]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:40.929 --> 00:22:43.432]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[00:24:10.937 --> 00:24:12.378]  Well, I've twisted his arm.
[00:24:12.398 --> 00:24:13.739]  There's so much to talk about.
[00:24:13.759 --> 00:24:15.500]  Stay a little bit in the next segment with us.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.542]  And then we've got Lord Moncton coming on today.
[00:24:20.487 --> 00:24:26.209]  There must be some kind of way out of here from frozen Minnesota to the beaches of Mexico, Governor Ventura.
[00:24:26.649 --> 00:24:28.189]  Well, I'll be getting out of here.
[00:24:28.229 --> 00:24:30.010]  I gotta go clear my head out for a while.
[00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.971]  Alex, I don't know how you do it day in and day out.
[00:24:33.451 --> 00:24:42.434]  I'm heading down there and right now all I can think about is dunking my head into the ocean and shaking it, you know, and clearing my head out and start
[00:24:43.101 --> 00:24:52.344]  Speaking again about taking a deep breath of freedom, which unfortunately, believe it or not, I get more of that in Mexico today than I do in the United States.
[00:24:53.744 --> 00:24:58.305]  Americans have been basted in tyranny until they don't even recognize corruption.
[00:24:59.026 --> 00:25:04.247]  Lord Monckton was on Russian television talking about how, in many respects, they're more democratic than England now.
[00:25:04.547 --> 00:25:08.728]  Shifting gears into Climategate, because that's something you wanted to comment on.
[00:25:08.768 --> 00:25:10.069]  You do have a global warming
[00:25:10.629 --> 00:25:10.789]  I don't
[00:25:32.628 --> 00:25:36.990]  Well, you know, the thing that really got my antenna to go up was their solution, cap and trade.
[00:25:56.926 --> 00:26:02.788]  This is nothing but a shell game and Alex, even worse than that, here's what it is.
[00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:13.873]  We right now pay taxes to our local government, we pay taxes to our state government, and we pay taxes to our national government.
[00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:19.615]  This, for the first time ever, will be a tax to a world government.
[00:26:21.236 --> 00:26:22.436]  A world tax.
[00:26:23.137 --> 00:26:24.977]  That is ridiculous, I think.
[00:26:25.738 --> 00:26:25.998]  Yes.
[00:26:26.969 --> 00:26:37.456]  You know, that we're now going to face taxation from a world entity, and that part of it is unacceptable to me, top to bottom.
[00:26:38.077 --> 00:26:43.421]  And the fact that this cap-and-trade, it does nothing to solve the problem.
[00:26:44.061 --> 00:26:46.683]  We all will admit that pollution is bad.
[00:26:47.139 --> 00:26:52.121]  We'll all admit that the less we pollute this planet, the better it is.
[00:26:52.642 --> 00:27:06.948]  But when the solution that they come up with does not do anything to solve the pollution problem, that tells me that there's a fraud involved, and that the real reason is to make money for people.
[00:27:07.949 --> 00:27:15.212]  And that's really what got me over the top, was the fact that this cap and trade is nothing but a shell game.
[00:27:16.895 --> 00:27:19.718]  Polluters can still pollute at the same level.
[00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:24.384]  All they have to do is buy their way out of it, and they're called neutral.
[00:27:25.044 --> 00:27:26.045]  Well, that's absurd.
[00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:29.950]  And it's ridiculous, and it's just a way for people to profit.
[00:27:30.623 --> 00:27:31.404]  Well it is!
[00:27:49.508 --> 00:27:54.991]  You know, you got popular mechanics tells the public, oh yeah, it could happen easy.
[00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:57.993]  You got other scientists that say it's a bunch of crap.
[00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:02.536]  And I personally can't figure out how it could fall at the speed of gravity.
[00:28:02.556 --> 00:28:04.116]  It defies basic physics.
[00:28:04.217 --> 00:28:05.557]  And you're a demolition expert.
[00:28:05.777 --> 00:28:06.478]  Exactly.
[00:28:07.278 --> 00:28:12.141]  Anyway, so I'm not going to get into the argument of the scientific end of it.
[00:28:12.521 --> 00:28:17.244]  I'll get into the political end of it, which this cap and trade is pure bull.
[00:28:18.064 --> 00:28:18.845]  Top to bottom.
[00:28:19.594 --> 00:28:19.875]  Yeah.
[00:28:35.882 --> 00:28:50.739]  Well Governor, there's lots of real pollution like toxic waste, overfishing, but carbon dioxide, I mean the amount that humans put out, we exhale carbon dioxide, the EPA is listing it as a toxic waste, it's what plants live off of, they then put off
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:51.840]  Horrible.
[00:29:20.183 --> 00:29:24.827]  And if we allow this to happen, then we deserve what we get, Alex.
[00:29:26.969 --> 00:29:34.075]  Governor Jesse Ventura, he'll do five, six more minutes with us on the other side on some other key issues and Lord Christopher Monckton coming up.
[00:29:34.415 --> 00:29:40.581]  But tomorrow night, the most powerful 9-11 information ever on mainstream television, 10 p.m.
[00:29:40.641 --> 00:29:41.902]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:29:41.942 --> 00:29:44.484]  Central, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:29:49.685 --> 00:29:52.687]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.608 --> 00:29:56.390]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.812 --> 00:30:03.056]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:03.376 --> 00:30:07.439]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:07.719 --> 00:30:13.123]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:13.464 --> 00:30:18.768]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:19.068 --> 00:30:19.609]  Number 3.
[00:30:19.889 --> 00:30:23.173]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:23.473 --> 00:30:27.198]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:27.398 --> 00:30:27.938]  Number 4.
[00:30:28.179 --> 00:30:30.562]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:34.346]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:34.626 --> 00:30:34.847]  Number 5.
[00:30:35.407 --> 00:30:39.331]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:39.551 --> 00:30:44.335]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:44.615 --> 00:30:48.639]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:48.779 --> 00:30:50.340]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:03.444]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:03.464 --> 00:32:06.827]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:11.851]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:11.871 --> 00:32:18.097]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:18.257 --> 00:32:20.499]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:21.019 --> 00:32:21.319]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:21.760]  Bernanke?
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.461]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:22.521 --> 00:32:23.782]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:23.802 --> 00:32:26.044]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:39.918 --> 00:32:46.882]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:32:47.203 --> 00:32:56.328]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:33:11.263 --> 00:33:11.844]  All right.
[00:33:21.892 --> 00:33:24.715]  All right, final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:33:24.755 --> 00:33:30.500]  By the way, we've been simulcasting since the start of the show at PrisonPlanet.tv for viewers there.
[00:33:31.441 --> 00:33:42.831]  And my new film, Fall of the Republic, ladies and gentlemen, has an hour in the two hour 24 minutes on the whole climate fraud, how the banks are setting up a private global corporate government from their own documents.
[00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:44.333]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:33:44.653 --> 00:33:45.134]  Today,
[00:33:45.734 --> 00:33:50.578]  But in a film I released a month and a half ago, Fall of the Republic, available at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:50.978 --> 00:33:56.302]  Governor Jesse Ventura, I want to finish up with ClimateGate and then finally ask you, what are you most upset about?
[00:33:56.342 --> 00:33:58.543]  What are you most outraged with currently?
[00:33:58.583 --> 00:34:03.027]  But with ClimateGate, how do we have the UN investigate it when they're behind it?
[00:34:03.087 --> 00:34:05.849]  How do we have the British government investigate when they're behind it?
[00:34:06.109 --> 00:34:13.054]  How do we have the federal government investigate when they want this new taxation control grid over all human activity?
[00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.951]  Well, you know, it simply comes back to the fact that we have to protest.
[00:34:18.031 --> 00:34:21.652]  We have to let our elected officials know that this is unacceptable.
[00:34:22.712 --> 00:34:25.253]  And people have to stand up for what they believe.
[00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:28.454]  And in the country now, ultimately, can you prevail?
[00:34:28.514 --> 00:34:29.934]  There's no guarantee of that.
[00:34:30.774 --> 00:34:34.575]  But certainly, I would hope our country still has the freedom
[00:34:35.177 --> 00:34:47.242]  That people are allowed to persist on an opposite viewpoint and not be, you know, attempted to be destroyed just because they think something's different than the status quo says it is.
[00:34:47.822 --> 00:34:55.145]  So if you're outraged over global warming and you're outraged over cap and trade, let your congressmen and senators know that.
[00:34:55.726 --> 00:35:00.448]  Because the biggest thing you can do is to make a phone call or write a letter to them.
[00:35:00.608 --> 00:35:01.128]  Trust me.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.543]  Always remember, these guys' ultimate goal is to be re-elected.
[00:35:07.384 --> 00:35:09.425]  They're there to serve themselves.
[00:35:09.505 --> 00:35:10.946]  They're not there to serve us.
[00:35:11.606 --> 00:35:12.907]  Career politicians.
[00:35:13.027 --> 00:35:14.148]  It's just what it's called.
[00:35:14.228 --> 00:35:15.149]  It's their career.
[00:35:15.965 --> 00:35:18.648]  Well, they're not going to jeopardize their careers.
[00:35:19.209 --> 00:35:24.536]  And if there's enough outrage voiced by the public, they will then listen.
[00:35:24.656 --> 00:35:28.901]  If there's no outrage, trust me, you're going to get it rammed down your throat.
[00:35:29.282 --> 00:35:34.168]  If there's no threat to their careers, they will do whatever well they damn please.
[00:35:34.673 --> 00:35:35.634]  Well, that's a good point.
[00:35:35.694 --> 00:35:47.910]  It's in the news today in the Washington Post and Washington Times that senior Democratic leaders like Senator Webb warn Obama on taking action in Copenhagen saying, look, this is red-handed fraud.
[00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.652]  They know the earth's getting cooler.
[00:35:49.932 --> 00:35:52.055]  They admit it's just a taxing power grab.
[00:35:52.375 --> 00:35:53.356]  More documents are...
[00:35:53.977 --> 00:35:54.558]  Leaking out.
[00:35:54.998 --> 00:35:57.099]  The system is bleeding out right now.
[00:35:57.399 --> 00:36:02.903]  This is now being called the greatest scientific fraud in modern history, and there's been many scientific frauds.
[00:36:03.503 --> 00:36:09.768]  And the Democrats are now panicking, saying, look, you better abandon this.
[00:36:09.908 --> 00:36:18.093]  And now the third world countries got the secret documents today that it's really a tax on them to stop their development when they were promised Western money.
[00:36:18.433 --> 00:36:20.755]  So they tell the third world, oh, you're going to get to rob the West.
[00:36:21.175 --> 00:36:25.657]  And then when really it's the big banks planning to rob them, so this whole thing is sinking.
[00:36:26.197 --> 00:36:27.838]  Well, I hope that it does.
[00:36:28.638 --> 00:36:33.900]  You know, if it don't, like I said, the best thing people to do is be vocal and active.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.880]  Take that time.
[00:36:35.601 --> 00:36:36.541]  Write that letter.
[00:36:36.681 --> 00:36:37.721]  Make that phone call.
[00:36:37.761 --> 00:36:39.302]  But let me also say this.
[00:36:39.962 --> 00:36:42.043]  Be civil with your phone calls.
[00:36:43.203 --> 00:36:44.764]  No personal insults.
[00:36:45.344 --> 00:36:46.725]  No personal attacks.
[00:36:47.407 --> 00:36:59.077]  State your business, state what you feel and how you feel they should react to that, but don't dig yourself into a hole by insulting anyone.
[00:36:59.397 --> 00:37:05.822]  That's the worst thing you can do when you make contact with an elected official, is throw an assault at them.
[00:37:06.623 --> 00:37:07.804]  You don't want to do that.
[00:37:08.665 --> 00:37:10.826]  But you can still be firm in your viewpoint.
[00:37:11.147 --> 00:37:12.508]  Now, Alex, moving ahead,
[00:37:13.172 --> 00:37:15.557]  I'll tell you what's outraging me right now.
[00:37:16.058 --> 00:37:17.480]  The war in Afghanistan.
[00:37:17.981 --> 00:37:21.968]  And the fact that we're going to put 30,000 of our troops in there and increase it.
[00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.834]  All while this country feels no pain.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:31.442]  We, if we're going to go to these two wars, then it's time to implement a war tax to pay for them.
[00:37:32.002 --> 00:37:33.562]  Imagine what we're doing, Alex.
[00:37:33.942 --> 00:37:37.604]  We're not overly sending our young men and women over there to die.
[00:37:37.624 --> 00:37:42.765]  We're going to make it so when they come home, they'll get to pay for it for the rest of their lives.
[00:37:43.385 --> 00:37:52.488]  Because this generation doesn't have the courage enough to either stand up and get out of these wars, or at least damn well pay for them.
[00:37:53.138 --> 00:37:54.159]  If we're going to fight them.
[00:37:54.719 --> 00:38:00.102]  I also am outraged that a draft is not being reinstituted immediately.
[00:38:00.622 --> 00:38:05.164]  You've got guys that have been over there for five, six and seven tours of duty.
[00:38:05.544 --> 00:38:06.745]  That's inhumane.
[00:38:07.405 --> 00:38:08.426]  They need relief.
[00:38:10.283 --> 00:38:16.148]  Implement the draft and you will see the wars not get bigger, you will see them come to an end.
[00:38:16.689 --> 00:38:26.858]  Because when little Johnny, who doesn't want to go, gets drafted, and a year later comes home in a body bag, that has a powerful influence on the neighborhood.
[00:38:27.018 --> 00:38:27.559]  Trust me.
[00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:33.928]  So you agree with Congressman Rangel that the way to end wars is to have a draft.
[00:38:34.048 --> 00:38:50.254]  And my problem with that is, the new draft, the National Compulsory Service Act, and the National Service Act, they have two different bills, the government's going to be able to decide who gets to stay and who gets to go, and they're going to build a domestic
[00:38:51.158 --> 00:38:56.300]  Before we jump to those conclusions, let's see that nobody has the courage to bring the draft back in the first place.
[00:39:15.615 --> 00:39:16.696]  That's not going to happen.
[00:39:16.756 --> 00:39:17.677]  Are you kidding me?
[00:39:18.018 --> 00:39:19.139]  Are you angry at Obama?
[00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:21.481]  I mean, has he really gone back?
[00:39:21.702 --> 00:39:26.747]  I'm angry that he would escalate that war over there after he told us he was getting us out.
[00:39:26.827 --> 00:39:36.558]  Because I'm an advocate of the true patriot right now is to bring... You know, I wish I had it in front of me, the letter that my son sent to me on Veterans Day.
[00:39:37.501 --> 00:39:45.866]  Talking about how we have to be diligent, how we've dropped the ball, because it's our job as the civilians to protect our military.
[00:39:46.787 --> 00:39:48.968]  And we have not done a good job on that.
[00:39:49.449 --> 00:39:52.351]  And what I mean by that is, we're to protect them.
[00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:57.174]  They're not to go out there and fight unless there's a direct national interest to us.
[00:39:58.906 --> 00:40:10.514]  And this stuff about fighting terrorism by going over and invading countries and occupying the countries with our military, that is going to do nothing to stop terrorism.
[00:40:10.835 --> 00:40:12.216]  It's like cap and trade.
[00:40:13.296 --> 00:40:19.621]  In fact, it's going to create more terrorists, because if you occupy a nation, they're going to hate you.
[00:40:20.683 --> 00:40:21.624]  They don't love you?
[00:40:22.204 --> 00:40:30.008]  Imagine for a minute if Hugo Chavez, with all his money, bought some land by Palm Springs and put the Venezuelan army in there.
[00:40:30.028 --> 00:40:32.049]  How would we feel about that?
[00:40:32.169 --> 00:40:33.370]  Not too good, would we?
[00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:38.332]  Well, how could we go around the world and have our bases in 178 foreign countries, and yet
[00:40:42.116 --> 00:40:43.659]  We're supposed to pay for all this.
[00:40:44.059 --> 00:40:45.942]  We're not even paying for these wars.
[00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:52.212]  We're going to make the very children that fight the wars come back and spend the rest of their lives paying for them also.
[00:40:52.673 --> 00:40:55.958]  I think that's pretty pathetic and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves.
[00:40:56.752 --> 00:41:05.501]  Well, in closing, the television show premiered last week to record ratings for TruTV, the number one news show in their history.
[00:41:06.562 --> 00:41:10.607]  And part two on 9-11 tomorrow night, 10 p.m.
[00:41:10.667 --> 00:41:12.168]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:41:12.228 --> 00:41:12.569]  Central.
[00:41:12.629 --> 00:41:15.912]  In closing, Governor Ventura, watching you as governor.
[00:41:16.793 --> 00:41:21.958]  A maverick, a true rebel, a revolutionary, was very refreshing.
[00:41:22.378 --> 00:41:28.064]  Watching the media demonize you and attack you and try to set you up was painful, but you were a statesman.
[00:41:28.104 --> 00:41:30.306]  You left after one term.
[00:41:30.806 --> 00:41:38.974]  And to see you grow and just get better and better and more informed and more libertarian, more anti-globalist,
[00:41:39.874 --> 00:41:41.955]  And to now see your TV show be a huge hit.
[00:41:42.415 --> 00:41:51.560]  I certainly hope it gets picked up for a second season, but as you've said many times off-air, you know, you don't know until it's picked up, but it certainly should be.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:42:03.566]  And everybody needs to do their job to spread the word about the show, but we salute your spirit of liberty, and as Mark Twain said, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[00:42:04.306 --> 00:42:11.150]  But in the end, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:18.734]  And so, a lot of timid people are joining the ranks, thanks to your leadership, Ron Paul's leadership, and so many others.
[00:42:19.174 --> 00:42:25.678]  And Governor, have a well-earned, extended hiatus in Mexico, and surf's up!
[00:42:26.419 --> 00:42:26.859]  Have fun!
[00:42:27.461 --> 00:42:30.625]  Thank you, Alex, and keep up the good work, man.
[00:42:30.645 --> 00:42:38.454]  I don't know how you do it day in and day out, but keep talking and keep disrupting the system because it's the American way.
[00:42:38.474 --> 00:42:43.099]  Between all of us, we won't let the country die.
[00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:43.820]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.621]  Have a great winter.
[00:42:44.982 --> 00:42:45.322]  You too.
[00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:45.742]  Take care.
[00:42:46.678 --> 00:42:48.840]  Alright, there goes Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.541]  Did I do the Mark Twain quote right?
[00:42:50.561 --> 00:42:51.602]  I did it right on CNN.
[00:42:51.923 --> 00:42:55.005]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned.
[00:42:55.345 --> 00:42:59.729]  But in time, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:01.651]  Did I say it right the first time?
[00:43:02.672 --> 00:43:05.994]  In time, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:43:06.675 --> 00:43:08.457]  And Jesse Ventura is the real deal.
[00:43:08.877 --> 00:43:09.618]  He's not perfect.
[00:43:09.698 --> 00:43:10.318]  I'm not perfect.
[00:43:10.358 --> 00:43:11.099]  None of us are perfect.
[00:43:11.539 --> 00:43:12.160]  But let me tell you.
[00:43:13.715 --> 00:43:16.137]  I know what's in this production piece.
[00:43:16.377 --> 00:43:18.358]  I've seen large segments of it.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.881]  Because last time I was out in L.A.
[00:43:22.921 --> 00:43:24.362]  a month ago, they were still editing it.
[00:43:25.543 --> 00:43:26.924]  So I haven't seen the finished product.
[00:43:30.246 --> 00:43:30.787]  It's powerful.
[00:43:32.256 --> 00:43:34.597]  I mean, this is not Michael Moore banging on doors.
[00:43:34.958 --> 00:43:36.358]  This is Jesse Ventura doing it.
[00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:39.920]  And I believe Luke Hradowski's in there, too.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:40.701]  We are changed.
[00:43:41.041 --> 00:43:42.722]  I mean, certainly in the footage I've seen, they are.
[00:43:42.742 --> 00:43:47.865]  I don't know if they're going to be in the finished thing that's done and airing tomorrow.
[00:43:48.845 --> 00:43:51.727]  And who knows what Time Warner's doing with their hands in there.
[00:43:52.828 --> 00:43:55.189]  But, you know, the establishment
[00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:04.359]  I've had reporters the last few weeks ask me, you know, why they think this Jesse Ventura show is actually going on air from our perspective.
[00:44:06.001 --> 00:44:09.285]  And it's really because the establishment has lost all credibility.
[00:44:09.566 --> 00:44:10.587]  They're losing viewers.
[00:44:11.007 --> 00:44:14.331]  They know that the general public wants to know about the New World Order.
[00:44:15.265 --> 00:44:26.873]  And I think by putting it on TruTV as entertainment, they know it'll get ratings, and they just think that, well, the public's already awake, the UN's admitting world government, why deny this anymore?
[00:44:28.795 --> 00:44:30.496]  And I think that's what's happening here.
[00:44:33.302 --> 00:44:45.992]  You know, I have been pitched so many television shows, I have been asked to fly to New York, asked to fly to L.A., I have been involved in TV shows, I have shot pilots with huge production companies, and then seen it not air.
[00:44:47.993 --> 00:44:48.754]  Seen it not air.
[00:44:50.355 --> 00:44:59.282]  And so, when Ventura's people are asking me to be a consultant on this, and also be in, I'm the only person that appears in multiple episodes,
[00:45:01.067 --> 00:45:02.048]  Four or five.
[00:45:02.088 --> 00:45:03.409]  They're still editing some of them.
[00:45:04.449 --> 00:45:10.113]  So, coming up in the next two weeks, you should see episodes I appear in.
[00:45:10.534 --> 00:45:11.634]  Some of them, I'm a large part of.
[00:45:11.674 --> 00:45:15.137]  Other parts, just a consultant, and you see me introducing Jesse to people.
[00:45:16.938 --> 00:45:21.221]  But, it's just good to see it get on air.
[00:45:23.343 --> 00:45:27.546]  It's like the Wall Street Journal came here and was going to do a cover story on me, and I said, this will never be printed.
[00:45:28.416 --> 00:45:30.478]  If this is not a hit piece, this will not be printed.
[00:45:31.078 --> 00:45:33.000]  And I said, did you find what you were wanting?
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.261]  Did you find the dirt you wanted?
[00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:35.242]  And no, not really.
[00:45:35.262 --> 00:45:42.088]  You know, you don't come in here and open a closet door and 45 skeletons fall out on the floor.
[00:45:43.149 --> 00:45:47.032]  Things have to be invented about us, and it really can't be done.
[00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:51.056]  Because you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:45:51.156 --> 00:45:53.318]  I mean, how many people have we woken up to the New World Order?
[00:45:55.253 --> 00:46:00.095]  How many times have we been attacked by mainstream and alternative media and even government entities?
[00:46:00.575 --> 00:46:00.915]  A lot.
[00:46:02.655 --> 00:46:04.296]  That's why I always challenge listeners.
[00:46:04.336 --> 00:46:08.237]  Don't get caught up in the infighting, the COINTELPRO, the disinformation.
[00:46:08.797 --> 00:46:09.858]  You know you're good.
[00:46:09.978 --> 00:46:11.098]  You know you're a patriot.
[00:46:11.518 --> 00:46:13.079]  You know you're awake and aware.
[00:46:14.379 --> 00:46:20.541]  And so instead of ninnying and spending all your time debating different radio hosts or filmmakers or patriot leaders,
[00:46:21.638 --> 00:46:22.838]  Chief among them myself.
[00:46:23.518 --> 00:46:26.539]  Spend your time warning people about the carbon tax.
[00:46:26.899 --> 00:46:36.881]  Spend your time warning people about state victim disarmament gun control bills and federal victim disarmament bills and treaty, the gun control treaty with the UN.
[00:46:36.941 --> 00:46:38.502]  Obama says he's going to sign next year.
[00:46:38.822 --> 00:46:43.423]  Our blanket open borders and amnesty that will bring in the North American Union and further bankrupt us.
[00:46:45.197 --> 00:46:53.821]  Or forced inoculations and how dangerous the vaccines are, warning people about the history of vaccines and the mercury and the cancer viruses.
[00:46:58.263 --> 00:47:04.666]  We're going to come back with the winner of the Berlin Film Festival a few years ago.
[00:47:04.706 --> 00:47:06.607]  This is just par for the course.
[00:47:07.671 --> 00:47:12.273]  Of the type of short films that are shown to little kids, teenagers, college students.
[00:47:12.653 --> 00:47:15.874]  The whole cover of YouTube is our future is being decided.
[00:47:16.275 --> 00:47:24.558]  That Copenhagen, almost every video on the front page is pro-global government, pro-tax links.
[00:47:26.959 --> 00:47:28.460]  I want to launch an initiative today.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:32.541]  I got Texas Monthly here interviewing me for what they say is probably going to maybe a cover story.
[00:47:36.578 --> 00:47:40.602]  But I'm gonna try to do several YouTube videos today.
[00:47:41.402 --> 00:47:42.003]  Today.
[00:47:43.104 --> 00:47:47.948]  That are really about Copenhagen and all the fraud that's come out there and the latest on ClimateGate.
[00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:50.931]  But I also...
[00:47:52.142 --> 00:47:57.909]  I don't want to do one calling for people in the next week and a half while Copenhagen's going on, the establishment of world government.
[00:47:58.169 --> 00:48:02.534]  They're calling it the most important meeting in history, the declaration of world government.
[00:48:03.215 --> 00:48:05.697]  I'm calling on everybody to make their own YouTube videos.
[00:48:05.857 --> 00:48:06.198]  Everyone.
[00:48:06.518 --> 00:48:07.700]  I don't care if you're not eloquent.
[00:48:08.928 --> 00:48:13.670]  Or if you are eloquent, or if you're mediocre, just get up there, point out issues.
[00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:16.551]  We need thousands of videos flooding YouTube.
[00:48:17.272 --> 00:48:21.093]  YouTube has more video views than all other video sites combined.
[00:48:21.394 --> 00:48:22.254]  Sure, it's controlled.
[00:48:22.334 --> 00:48:23.254]  Sure, it's manipulated.
[00:48:23.595 --> 00:48:24.875]  Sure, it's bad in many respects.
[00:48:25.135 --> 00:48:26.516]  But it's where the fight is.
[00:48:28.237 --> 00:48:32.999]  With a Schmidt character that owns it, pushing world government and promoting tyranny.
[00:48:33.519 --> 00:48:35.200]  We need to take YouTube over.
[00:48:36.169 --> 00:48:40.273]  They counter their propaganda and make videos about how they're engaged in a bunch of propaganda.
[00:48:41.534 --> 00:48:43.796]  Because they're whining and screaming and yelling.
[00:48:43.976 --> 00:48:47.600]  All the controlled corporate press and the Fortune 500.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.101]  They're all redoubling.
[00:48:49.141 --> 00:48:57.990]  I mean, I've been watching the news and I can't believe how mindless and base and ridiculously off the chart.
[00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.912]  If I was going to make a science fiction movie about a
[00:49:03.328 --> 00:49:07.991]  A science fiction, dark satire movie about the ultimate propaganda state.
[00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:13.033]  I would just go point cameras at Copenhagen and show that in the movie.
[00:49:13.393 --> 00:49:17.256]  I mean, they've got giant billboards with little girls saying, please, I don't want to drown.
[00:49:17.896 --> 00:49:20.597]  And images of polar bears saying they're all dying.
[00:49:20.777 --> 00:49:21.978]  They're almost extinct.
[00:49:22.338 --> 00:49:29.402]  When they've gone from 10,000 in the Arctic areas to over 45,000.
[00:49:30.383 --> 00:49:32.484]  Their numbers are exploding like cockroaches.
[00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:40.814]  And they're showing films at Copenhagen that tell school children they're all going to die.
[00:49:40.834 --> 00:49:43.116]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:49:44.297 --> 00:49:45.377]  This is ridiculous.
[00:49:45.517 --> 00:50:00.528]  And this video coming up shows humans as a disease spreading across the globe and then blasting off in rocket ships to infest the galaxy as a disease.
[00:50:00.728 --> 00:50:01.909]  No, we're not a disease.
[00:50:03.547 --> 00:50:05.309]  Jesse Ventura's not a disease.
[00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:07.612]  Ron Paul's not a disease.
[00:50:07.692 --> 00:50:09.334]  Martin Luther King's not a disease.
[00:50:09.694 --> 00:50:11.436]  Leonardo da Vinci's not a disease.
[00:50:11.716 --> 00:50:18.284]  We are an incredible species who can produce amazing art and passion and love and honor.
[00:50:18.924 --> 00:50:30.777]  And the globalists know that and they want to have a control over society and control over information to dumb us down so they can control future, so they can control the destiny of humanity.
[00:50:31.038 --> 00:50:39.186]  We have to wrest control over the future of humanity from these people and let humanity really make the decision what we want to do from there.
[00:50:40.202 --> 00:50:49.715]  That's why I don't like football and petty stuff because it's issues of no significance that don't matter as we're on this planet hurtling through intergalactic space.
[00:50:51.177 --> 00:50:52.259]  That's what really matters.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.681]  And awaken!
[00:50:54.721 --> 00:50:56.802]  You don't have to agree with me, just awaken!
[00:50:57.143 --> 00:50:57.843]  Wake up!
[00:50:57.963 --> 00:50:58.544]  Wake up!
[00:50:58.564 --> 00:50:59.364]  There's more to the world!
[00:50:59.384 --> 00:51:01.566]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[00:51:01.686 --> 00:51:03.427]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[00:51:03.587 --> 00:51:05.369]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:06.770]  We paid off all of our bills.
[00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.612]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[00:51:09.652 --> 00:51:15.216]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[00:51:15.296 --> 00:51:16.897]  Even have more money left over each month?
[00:51:16.977 --> 00:51:19.579]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[00:51:19.639 --> 00:51:20.040]  NoMoreMortgage.
[00:51:22.081 --> 00:51:23.302]  Where have they been all of our life?
[00:51:23.362 --> 00:51:25.784]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[00:51:25.864 --> 00:51:29.486]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.

[00:51:53.303 --> 00:51:55.685]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:55.705 --> 00:51:56.866]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:56.886 --> 00:51:58.067]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:09.804 --> 00:52:12.466]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:12.486 --> 00:52:18.691]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:18.872 --> 00:52:23.916]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:24.416 --> 00:52:27.218]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:52:27.338 --> 00:52:34.064]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:34.164 --> 00:52:36.266]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:36.506 --> 00:52:37.847]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:38.087 --> 00:52:40.369]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:40.569 --> 00:52:42.411]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:42.671 --> 00:52:47.475]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:54:02.743 --> 00:54:03.163]  Our Earth.

[00:54:05.745 --> 00:54:07.725]  But wait, what's that you've got there?
[00:54:08.946 --> 00:54:11.207]  It looks like you've got a case of the humans.
[00:54:12.128 --> 00:54:17.290]  To be a healthy Earth, all of your elements must be in equilibrium.
[00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:22.813]  However, these parasites slaughter all other forms of life.
[00:54:25.954 --> 00:54:27.515]  Guzzle your natural resources.
[00:54:31.027 --> 00:54:32.048]  Earth is just the start.
[00:54:32.088 --> 00:54:35.850]  Who knows what's next?
[00:55:00.475 --> 00:55:03.495]  Oh, they're killing the whole universe, the whole solar system.
[00:55:09.281 --> 00:55:17.108]  You've got the globalist parasites with their hookers and caviar and jets and limos saying carbon dioxide's bad.
[00:55:17.289 --> 00:55:17.669]  It's not.
[00:55:17.689 --> 00:55:19.351]  It's what plants live off of.
[00:55:20.131 --> 00:55:32.043]  You've got them running around lying to the public when carbon dioxide is a tiny part of the atmosphere to begin with and the UN admits it's a fraction of a fraction of a fraction
[00:55:33.499 --> 00:55:37.502]  That we actually put off and that it's a good thing, but that doesn't matter.
[00:55:37.862 --> 00:55:41.425]  We're parasites and the global government wants to get rid of us.
[00:55:42.066 --> 00:55:43.907]  This is what they show school children.
[00:55:44.347 --> 00:55:46.269]  This is what's being pushed on everyone.
[00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:49.811]  This is what the Fortune 500 is behind.
[00:55:50.472 --> 00:55:51.793]  This is what they're promoting 24-7.
[00:55:51.873 --> 00:56:01.620]  We've got another clip coming up later where they're teaching everybody, oh, we're going to track your car and track everywhere you go and track your carbon footprint and tax you to save the earth.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:01.680]  No.
[00:56:03.007 --> 00:56:04.307]  It's a Big Brother takeover.
[00:56:04.367 --> 00:56:06.748]  It's a global government, private corporate takeover.
[00:56:07.308 --> 00:56:09.669]  And we have huge new developments in ClimateGate.
[00:56:09.689 --> 00:56:14.090]  We're going to be talking about later in the next hour with Lord Christopher Monckton.
[00:56:15.491 --> 00:56:21.413]  So you definitely want to stay with us for that today.
[00:56:22.173 --> 00:56:31.356]  And then after Lord Monckton leaves us, we are going to open the phones up in the third and fourth hour and cover all of this news.
[00:56:32.396 --> 00:56:33.217]  And information.
[00:56:33.277 --> 00:56:39.922]  And yes, we're simulcasting the entire four-hour radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:39.942 --> 00:56:46.988]  And I did want to encourage listeners, every month of December, for every year we've had PrisonPlanet.tv coming up on six years,
[00:56:48.246 --> 00:56:48.646]  I don't
[00:57:04.517 --> 00:57:11.566]  And that pays for our bandwidth, pays for our IT people, pays for the cameras, the videos, the travel, making the films.
[00:57:11.826 --> 00:57:14.229]  And I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:57:14.249 --> 00:57:15.110]  We have upgraded it.
[00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:16.832]  It has super fast servers.
[00:57:17.473 --> 00:57:19.655]  All of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[00:57:20.834 --> 00:57:28.004]  The live radio show is simulcast with the documents, the videos, the photos, the guest in studio, when you're at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:35.133]  Remember, and if you can't watch it live every day, we archive higher quality audio archives at PrisonPlanet.tv, commercial free.
[00:57:36.114 --> 00:57:42.596]  We also have the archive of the live TV show that we simulcast there for your listening and viewing convenience.
[00:57:43.536 --> 00:57:48.477]  Just so much more that we're adding to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:57:49.137 --> 00:57:50.757]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:57:51.217 --> 00:57:53.398]  And you can share your passcode.
[00:57:53.498 --> 00:57:57.059]  Six computers simultaneously can log on with the same passcode.
[00:57:57.239 --> 00:58:02.440]  So give yourself the gift of a PrisonPlanet.TV membership and then you can give it to one of your family members.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:06.561]  Just explain to them not to share it with too many, or it'll lock them out while people are logged on.
[00:58:06.601 --> 00:58:07.521]  It won't do it permanently.
[00:58:08.802 --> 00:58:20.424]  And so you can give yourself the gift of PrisonPlanet.tv, download the films, burn them to disk, give them to people, follow the Republic, Endgame, Terror Storm, The Obama Deception, all my films, all 24 of my films.
[00:58:22.938 --> 00:58:23.958]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.434 --> 00:58:52.035]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:52.436 --> 00:58:57.398]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:57.758 --> 00:58:59.499]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:59.819 --> 00:59:04.622]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:04.822 --> 00:59:05.782]  How much do you want?
[00:59:06.002 --> 00:59:06.743]  When do you want it?
[00:59:07.123 --> 00:59:08.724]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:09.004 --> 00:59:09.824]  When will you need it?
[00:59:10.084 --> 00:59:12.145]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:12.286 --> 00:59:13.386]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:13.626 --> 00:59:14.927]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:15.247 --> 00:59:17.530]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:20.213]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:20.413 --> 00:59:23.597]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:23.997 --> 00:59:27.501]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:27.821 --> 00:59:28.802]  How much will you need?
[00:59:29.043 --> 00:59:29.663]  We don't know.
[00:59:29.944 --> 00:59:30.865]  How much do you want?
[00:59:31.045 --> 00:59:31.786]  All you can get.
[00:59:31.986 --> 00:59:32.366]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:33.067 --> 00:59:35.828]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:36.108 --> 00:59:38.289]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:39.310]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:40.490]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:42.351]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:03.706 --> 01:00:04.346]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.007 --> 01:00:06.068]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.768 --> 01:00:07.889]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.529 --> 01:00:09.330]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:10.891]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:15.294]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.854 --> 01:00:19.939]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.719 --> 01:00:23.763]  Well, we just had Governor Jesse Ventura back on.
[01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:30.289]  He happened to be with us last Friday, and then Lord Monckton came on, saying that ClimateGate is an absolute fraud, it's all a scam.
[01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.713]  He was, a few years ago, on the bandwagon with them.
[01:00:34.193 --> 01:00:35.034]  He was fooled.
[01:00:35.094 --> 01:00:36.496]  He's now admitted he was fooled.
[01:00:36.936 --> 01:00:37.998]  He's very angry.
[01:00:38.118 --> 01:00:46.608]  A lot of supporters, well-meaning supporters of this fraud, are now waking up en masse thanks to the work and the research.
[01:00:48.215 --> 01:00:48.655]  All right.
[01:01:07.901 --> 01:01:08.302]  The U.N.'
[01:01:08.282 --> 01:01:10.265]  's calling it the most important summit in history.
[01:01:10.526 --> 01:01:13.110]  YouTube says our future is being decided in Copenhagen.
[01:01:13.531 --> 01:01:14.252]  They're pushing it.
[01:01:14.673 --> 01:01:17.958]  Lord Christopher Moncton, 3rd Viscount of Moncton and Brinchley.
[01:01:19.432 --> 01:01:30.177]  He has worked at all levels of government, has been a top journalist, has a scientific organization advising governments and corporations, was one of the chief advisors to Margaret Thatcher.
[01:01:30.217 --> 01:01:31.337]  The list goes on and on.
[01:01:31.617 --> 01:01:32.958]  He really needs no introduction.
[01:01:33.698 --> 01:01:36.019]  But Lord Monckton, we've got a break in three minutes.
[01:01:36.039 --> 01:01:38.080]  We'll come back with plenty of time to break this down.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:42.982]  But first off, the climate gate blew up even bigger than I thought it would.
[01:01:43.002 --> 01:01:44.543]  It is collapsing.
[01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:47.404]  You are now there at the center of these crooks
[01:01:51.025 --> 01:01:57.947]  Well, it's almost as though Climategate hadn't happened, to be honest.
[01:01:58.447 --> 01:02:05.569]  The vast majority of the world's mainstream media have still not really said what's in the Climategate emails.
[01:02:05.609 --> 01:02:11.311]  They may have mentioned it once or twice, as the BBC has, but they've not given it anything like the coverage it deserves.
[01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:27.143]  Given the magnitude of the draft treaty, which is under consideration here, when I went into the conference yesterday to ask for a copy of the treaty, I went to the UN documentation centre and said, right, I want the current draft of the negotiating text.
[01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:30.886]  And they looked at me as though they were baffled.
[01:02:31.466 --> 01:02:37.770]  You know, the librarian there who had stacks of papers behind her in various languages, she just looked as though she'd never heard of it.
[01:02:38.737 --> 01:02:42.078]  So I insisted, and it took about 10 minutes, and they consulted each other.
[01:02:42.098 --> 01:02:43.698]  There were three or four of them arguing over it.
[01:02:44.078 --> 01:02:46.139]  None of them would produce the document.
[01:02:46.819 --> 01:02:50.640]  So I then did a quick interview with a passing TV camera and came back with an attack.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:55.042]  And I said, look, I know this treaty exists because this is what the conference is all about.
[01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.402]  It's discussing a treaty draft.
[01:02:58.142 --> 01:03:00.223]  And they said, oh, no, we've got no such thing.
[01:03:00.323 --> 01:03:04.304]  And I said, well, you have, and I want it, and I'm not going to be put off.
[01:03:04.704 --> 01:03:07.665]  And if I am put off, there will be an international diplomatic incident.
[01:03:08.177 --> 01:03:15.120]  And only then did they produce a stack of papers two inches thick, a thousand pages, most of which was just a complete development.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:24.564]  But right at the bottom of the stack, when I ploughed my way through it, I found hidden the draft or the current draft of the treaty.
[01:03:25.064 --> 01:03:30.987]  And once again, they are desperately trying to conceal from everybody here the magnitude
[01:03:31.437 --> 01:03:32.818]  Of what they're attempting to do.
[01:03:33.158 --> 01:03:35.720]  They really are aiming to set up a world government.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.982]  They no longer use the word government in the treaty.
[01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:40.884]  I think we've frightened them off that.
[01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:55.934]  But all the institutions of this world government and the enormous powers it's going to be given over free markets to tax the American economy to the extent of 2% of GDP, to impose a further tax of 2% on every financial transaction.
[01:03:55.954 --> 01:03:58.776]  That could come to a very large GDP overall.
[01:03:59.309 --> 01:04:05.992]  And to close down, effectively, the economy of the West, transfer your jobs, if you're listening to this, to third world countries.
[01:04:06.413 --> 01:04:16.618]  All of that is still in the treaty draft, even after all the negotiating rounds, even after the fuss that we've all made to try to make them rethink, and even after climate change.
[01:04:18.769 --> 01:04:33.306]  Well, this is just devastating information, so this appears to be breaking news because I've been doing searches every hour for the latest draft text and the media was saying it wasn't released.
[01:04:33.686 --> 01:04:36.429]  There was this Danish text dealing with the
[01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:39.793]  Uh, way the taxes would be implemented.
[01:04:39.813 --> 01:04:42.656]  We'll find out if that's the same text you have.
[01:04:42.696 --> 01:04:45.780]  That's up on the London Guardian website right now.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.703]  But this is massive breaking news.
[01:04:49.063 --> 01:04:52.147]  They're also reporting taxes on all air travel globally.
[01:04:52.968 --> 01:04:54.890]  Taxes on all fuel globally.
[01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:56.672]  Just a complete takeover.
[01:04:57.112 --> 01:04:58.734]  But this financial tax, wow!
[01:04:58.814 --> 01:05:05.658]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:05:05.778 --> 01:05:07.739]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.641]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:06:58.362 --> 01:07:03.549]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:07:03.689 --> 01:07:08.055]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:07:08.215 --> 01:07:10.058]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:07:10.478 --> 01:07:11.840]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.142]  There is a solution.

[01:08:00.413 --> 01:08:05.977]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.044 --> 01:08:16.377]  We have the fraudulent Climategate emails from the head UN-affiliated climate center in East Anglia.
[01:08:18.035 --> 01:08:25.602]  We have the fake hockey stick, the lies about the Arctic completely melting, the lies about polar bears and penguins can't swim.
[01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:32.308]  I'm seeing billboards all over Copenhagen saying, save the polar bears, they're going to die.
[01:08:32.368 --> 01:08:33.189]  Complete fraud.
[01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:36.872]  Big billboards of little girls saying, please don't let me drown.
[01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:39.255]  The most base, mindless,
[01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:41.597]  Fraudulent information.
[01:08:41.697 --> 01:08:48.503]  Holdren saying 13 foot sea levels, when the UN themselves says, what, 7 to 21 inches.
[01:08:49.203 --> 01:08:51.185]  And that itself based on a fraud.
[01:08:51.926 --> 01:08:56.950]  We have now Lord Christopher Monckton, because he is a member of the House of Lords, went in.
[01:08:57.731 --> 01:08:57.891]  I think?
[01:09:16.738 --> 01:09:21.202]  So just that's got the third world now reeling, threatening to back out.
[01:09:21.242 --> 01:09:23.024]  The Saudis are calling for investigations.
[01:09:23.424 --> 01:09:24.445]  So much is happening.
[01:09:24.726 --> 01:09:31.052]  I'm going to attempt to go over all of this in the next 51 minutes with Lord Christopher Monckton, again, graciously joining us.
[01:09:31.072 --> 01:09:35.195]  So I'm going to try to just sit back, sir, and let you chronicle.
[01:09:35.235 --> 01:09:37.357]  You're there at Copenhagen.
[01:09:38.078 --> 01:09:48.391]  But also the good news, UN climate chief does say hacked emails are damaging, but as you said, they're like the cat caught with a canary in its mouth, going on about its business like it's no big deal.
[01:09:49.412 --> 01:09:53.156]  They're trying very very hard to pretend that climate change didn't happen.
[01:09:54.272 --> 01:10:01.599]  The people who've come to the conference don't really know that it happened because most of the mainstream media have still really not said what's in these emails.
[01:10:01.899 --> 01:10:08.586]  And what is happening is that the mainstream media have done themselves terrible damage by signing up to this climate nonsense.
[01:10:09.065 --> 01:10:09.485]  I don't know.
[01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:36.049]  We've got a temperature which in fact has been falling and we can't explain why.
[01:10:36.349 --> 01:10:38.310]  And it's a travesty that we can't explain why.
[01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:43.052]  So they're saying one thing to us publicly to maintain the scare, making them rich.
[01:10:43.332 --> 01:10:44.652]  And that's what's called fraud.
[01:10:44.712 --> 01:10:45.773]  It's criminal fraud.
[01:10:46.053 --> 01:10:52.295]  And on the other hand, they're saying privately, oh dear, oh dear, we can't account for the fact there's been no warming for the last 15 years.
[01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:54.796]  I mean, that is, it's very serious.
[01:10:55.297 --> 01:11:01.359]  This disconnect between what they're saying among themselves privately and what they're admitting to us publicly.
[01:11:04.429 --> 01:11:05.209]  Absolutely.
[01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:21.173]  Talking about criminal investigations, Lord Monckton, we have Senator Inhofe calling for it, the Saudis calling for investigations, and the Saudis have pointed out the United Nations, the progenitor of this fraud, they can't run the investigation.
[01:11:22.053 --> 01:11:29.695]  No, they can't, because the United Nations is thoroughly compromised in all this, because the climate panel that it created via the United Nations
[01:11:30.265 --> 01:11:37.570]  Environment Programme and the World Health Organization, namely this Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has produced four major reports on the climate.
[01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:59.445]  Those four major reports are now all under a cloud, because all the major contributors to those reports, the lead authors, indeed the lead author of the entire science report of 2007, are part of these emails, part of this conspiracy to conceal, manipulate, tamper with, invent, make up,
[01:11:59.735 --> 01:11:59.995]  I think so.
[01:12:09.815 --> 01:12:13.938]  It's a very, very serious matter and there's no way the UN can be allowed to do this.
[01:12:14.338 --> 01:12:21.763]  I think this has got to go to district attorneys in the United States and it's got to go to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in the United Kingdom.
[01:12:22.003 --> 01:12:33.151]  It's already gone to the Information Commissioner because there are plain admissions in emails there over the years that they have been planning to avoid disclosing information to other scientists.
[01:12:33.371 --> 01:12:38.675]  Which is contrary to the scientific method, as well as contrary to UK freedom of information law.
[01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:59.090]  But the final seal on that freedom of information thing is the email in which one of the people concerned wrote to all the others and said, you must destroy all your emails related to our participation in the fourth assessment report of the United Nations Climate Panel in 2007, because we're being asked for it by another scientist under the Freedom of Information Act.
[01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.930]  So you must destroy it.
[01:13:01.104 --> 01:13:11.571]  Email clearly constitutes a serious criminal offence for which the highest possible level of financial penalty is allowed for by the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
[01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:17.995]  And the person who wrote that email, whom I won't name on the air because it's not fair to him, he is now going to face criminal charges.
[01:13:18.015 --> 01:13:27.021]  He is, I think, going to be indicted, convicted, and he won't be imprisoned because we don't imprison people yet for these offences.
[01:13:27.061 --> 01:13:28.742]  I think the law's going to have to change in the next
[01:13:29.298 --> 01:13:37.303]  But he will certainly be subjected, as will his institution, to a very large financial penalty indeed, and quite rightly so.
[01:13:37.503 --> 01:13:50.071]  Well, you're a member of the House of Lords, the upper chamber of your parliament, for those that don't know, Lorchers, Vermont, and are you saying that the inside information that you're getting from government is that he will be prosecuted?
[01:13:50.932 --> 01:13:56.776]  No, because the government would be most improper if it were to involve itself anyway
[01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:59.114]  In whether or not to prosecute somebody.
[01:13:59.154 --> 01:14:05.558]  That is a function entirely of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is an official who has to be independent of government.
[01:14:05.818 --> 01:14:10.561]  And also, I myself, although a member of the House of Lords, do not have the right to sit or vote.
[01:14:10.662 --> 01:14:11.662]  That was taken away from me.
[01:14:11.682 --> 01:14:13.804]  No, no, I understand, but I'm saying... Yeah.
[01:14:14.344 --> 01:14:21.568]  But I'm saying you're saying you believe he will be charged, or you're expecting... I think it is certain that he will be charged.
[01:14:22.569 --> 01:14:37.114]  Together with Professor Fred Singer, who founded the US Satellite Weather Service many years ago, have written an official complaint to the Information Commissioner, asking him to look into this, as has one of the people who had made a Freedom of Information request.
[01:14:37.474 --> 01:14:40.755]  Now, the person who made that information request has been answered.
[01:14:40.815 --> 01:14:42.335]  We have not yet been answered.
[01:14:42.835 --> 01:14:47.557]  And if I don't get an answer in the next few days, and as soon as I get back from this Copenhagen conference,
[01:14:47.964 --> 01:14:54.307]  I will be arranging for questions to be put down in the House of Lords about why the Information Commissioner isn't doing his job and replying to his correspondents.
[01:14:54.707 --> 01:15:09.114]  So you're going to demand, you're going to demand justice, and you and others have filed former complaints, formal complaints, and we have them red-handed talking to the government, colluding to keep the public from getting information that should be public.
[01:15:09.394 --> 01:15:13.116]  I mean, that certainly is a conspiracy to engage in a cover-up.
[01:15:13.706 --> 01:15:14.787]  It's worse than that.
[01:15:15.027 --> 01:15:29.041]  It's also against every rule of science, because the only way science can work is if people who publish results on which the largest tax increase and the largest abandonment of freedom
[01:15:29.654 --> 01:15:33.095]  Ever conceived is about to be negotiated here at Copenhagen.
[01:15:33.455 --> 01:15:42.339]  They have not been sharing their results and their computer programs and their data with other scientists so that those other scientists can check them.
[01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:58.745]  All of this has been done behind closed doors so that they could get away with what turns out to be not just an information offense but also a very serious scientific and financial criminal fraud for which a very long
[01:15:59.269 --> 01:16:03.550]  That sentence in prison is the appropriate remedy.
[01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:17.833]  And what I have had is requests from two immensely senior professors, one in the United States and one in Canada, that I should draft for them complaints to the British police because they don't know how we do it here.
[01:16:17.853 --> 01:16:19.354]  They want me to just do that for them.
[01:16:19.634 --> 01:16:21.754]  They will make sure that I've got all the facts correct.
[01:16:21.794 --> 01:16:25.515]  They've both sent me a large amount of information about the fact it's their case.
[01:16:26.018 --> 01:16:45.202]  Because they're named in these emails in the most uncomplimentary way, and it's very clear that a plot to devalue their scientific research by unfair and foul and dishonest means had been engaged in by the conspirators who have been talking to each other in these emails.
[01:16:45.702 --> 01:16:51.683]  So I will be going to see the police superintendent in the East Anglia Constabulary.
[01:16:51.994 --> 01:16:56.221]  Who is heading up the investigation into who the whistleblower is and whether he should be prosecuted.
[01:16:56.241 --> 01:17:06.877]  And I can tell you from now, he won't be prosecuted because we have legislation which allows whistleblowers to bring criminal offences to the attention of the public in this way without suffering any penalty themselves.
[01:17:07.455 --> 01:17:09.696]  So the whistleblower will not be prosecuted.
[01:17:09.957 --> 01:17:32.411]  However, I will be saying to the police officer that there is clear and systematic evidence of deliberate wide-scale fraud right across the meteorological community in NASA, in NOAA, in the University of East Anglia, in Penn State University, in universities and institutions of learning right across the world.
[01:17:33.072 --> 01:17:41.075]  We're a small coterie of malevolent scientists, and they come across as very nasty people in the way they write about everybody else that disagrees with them.
[01:17:41.475 --> 01:17:52.000]  They're very nasty people, they're highly politically motivated, and they're very bad and incompetent scientists, and also very vicious to anyone who dares to disagree.
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:57.842]  And this unpleasantness is the first thing that strikes anyone who reads these papers.
[01:17:57.882 --> 01:18:00.383]  But of course, unfortunately, here at Copenhagen,
[01:18:01.266 --> 01:18:04.728]  Most of the people basically can't read at all as far as I can see.
[01:18:04.908 --> 01:18:08.571]  So the idea that they would read these emails is unthinkable.
[01:18:18.637 --> 01:18:31.943]  Isn't it important to get these charges rolling while Copenhagen's going on because that will really blow up in the establishment's face and that's why they're panicking because they know they've been engaging in all this crime earlier last week.
[01:18:31.983 --> 01:18:33.044]  I'm sure you're aware of this.
[01:18:33.844 --> 01:18:37.366]  You're always a few steps ahead of us or more or several leagues ahead of us.
[01:18:38.106 --> 01:18:39.327]  It's now coming out that the UN
[01:18:40.547 --> 01:18:48.829]  Of course, there's been a lot of evidence that one of the people who is very prominently named in the emails, and indeed one of the people exchanging these emails,
[01:19:07.384 --> 01:19:15.553]  is the person who the UN called in to rewrite the 1995 second major climate assessment report.
[01:19:15.573 --> 01:19:17.615]  They do these every five years, the UN.
[01:19:18.256 --> 01:19:19.136]  Really big report.
[01:19:19.156 --> 01:19:21.819]  So this is the sort of what the bedwetters based their case on.
[01:19:21.859 --> 01:19:23.161]  They were the UN says this.
[01:19:23.221 --> 01:19:30.008]  Now, the UN said in 1995 report, this was what the scientists, around a thousand of them, had signed off on.
[01:19:30.549 --> 01:19:36.131]  What they said was, there is no detectable human influence on global temperature.
[01:19:36.331 --> 01:19:37.511]  We can't find any.
[01:19:37.811 --> 01:19:39.532]  We don't know when we will find one.
[01:19:39.952 --> 01:19:41.612]  We're not sure that there is any such thing.
[01:19:41.632 --> 01:19:42.813]  Now, they said that five times.
[01:19:43.093 --> 01:19:46.214]  And here comes one man, at the request of the U.S.
[01:19:46.394 --> 01:19:48.634]  This is how we know this is the U.S.
[01:19:48.954 --> 01:19:50.595]  At the request of the U.S.
[01:19:50.715 --> 01:19:52.816]  I think they wrote the report.
[01:19:53.896 --> 01:19:54.556]  We've got a break.
[01:19:54.596 --> 01:19:57.217]  We're going to come back with this key information straight ahead.
[01:19:59.488 --> 01:20:02.511]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:20:02.852 --> 01:20:06.355]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:20:06.675 --> 01:20:10.119]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:20:10.399 --> 01:20:18.848]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[01:20:18.848 --> 01:20:19.468]  Yeah, it's a water filter.
[01:20:19.488 --> 01:20:20.029]  It purifies stagnant water.
[01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:27.233]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems from the smallest to the largest systems.
[01:20:27.613 --> 01:20:31.416]  Big Berkey Water Filters .com has what you need with your system purchase.

[01:20:58.997 --> 01:20:59.377]  Good day.
[01:20:59.597 --> 01:21:01.118]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[01:21:01.258 --> 01:21:01.578]  December 8, 2009.
[01:21:01.678 --> 01:21:02.878]  Gold open this morning at $11.5420.
[01:21:02.939 --> 01:21:05.579]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.8544, $5.9272 for a half-ounce, or $2.9636 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:21:05.619 --> 01:21:06.140]  That's $11.8544, $5.9272, or $2.9636.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:28.624]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:21:28.764 --> 01:21:31.885]  With a stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:21:31.965 --> 01:21:35.307]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:21:35.367 --> 01:21:38.128]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:21:38.348 --> 01:21:41.029]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:21:41.109 --> 01:21:43.869]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.069 --> 01:21:46.230]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:47.070]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:52.932]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.952 --> 01:21:53.152]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:04.037]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:04.417 --> 01:22:07.423]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:22:07.663 --> 01:22:09.086]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:22:09.787 --> 01:22:12.449]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:18.674]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:18.835 --> 01:22:23.859]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:23.879 --> 01:22:34.027]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:34.127 --> 01:22:36.229]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:36.469 --> 01:22:37.810]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:40.352]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:40.532 --> 01:22:42.374]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:42.654 --> 01:22:47.438]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:47.798 --> 01:22:56.925]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:58.928 --> 01:23:02.091]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:23:02.471 --> 01:23:04.293]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:23:04.754 --> 01:23:05.174]  Don't!
[01:23:05.634 --> 01:23:08.657]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:23:09.058 --> 01:23:17.846]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[01:23:18.166 --> 01:23:21.830]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:24.951]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:23:25.351 --> 01:23:32.392]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:23:32.732 --> 01:23:33.712]  Herb K. was right.
[01:23:33.913 --> 01:23:36.973]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:23:37.093 --> 01:23:38.113]  What have you got to lose?
[01:23:38.453 --> 01:23:41.634]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:23:42.154 --> 01:23:42.874]  Get Herb K.'

[01:23:50.897 --> 01:23:50.937]  888-352-7726.
[01:23:50.957 --> 01:23:52.378]  I was a highway man.
[01:23:52.398 --> 01:23:55.100]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.121]  With sword and pistol by my side.
[01:23:57.141 --> 01:24:02.265]  The explosive knowledge lost her marbles to my trade.
[01:24:19.847 --> 01:24:20.027]  That's
[01:24:34.787 --> 01:24:34.927]  I think?
[01:25:01.607 --> 01:25:14.755]  And bent the will of these Copenhagen UN bureaucrats to cough up the latest secret version of the treaty with taxes on money, financial transfers.
[01:25:15.236 --> 01:25:17.137]  I mean, this is off the charts.
[01:25:17.637 --> 01:25:21.400]  I want to get your take on the propaganda on the ground there.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.362]  I want to get your take on what all the scientists are out there talking about.
[01:25:25.702 --> 01:25:31.166]  How many people will die and starve to death if even a small amount of this is implemented?
[01:25:31.546 --> 01:25:33.927]  What the biofuels has already done?
[01:25:33.948 --> 01:25:36.369]  I mean this is so monstrous.
[01:25:36.949 --> 01:25:37.750]  Please continue.
[01:25:38.871 --> 01:25:39.131]  Right.
[01:25:39.291 --> 01:25:40.592]  Where would you like me to start?
[01:25:41.807 --> 01:25:43.388]  Well, you got cut off by the break.
[01:25:43.408 --> 01:25:59.294]  You got cut off by the break getting into the fraud, but I want to... Yes, I was just saying that I've had these two eminent professors who've asked me to put a case to the police, and as soon as I get back from this conference, I will be going to see the senior police officer, the police superintendent in the East Anglia Constabulary, investigating this matter.
[01:25:59.734 --> 01:26:01.815]  I will be laying their report for him.
[01:26:01.955 --> 01:26:10.478]  I will be asking for a two-hour briefing so that I can brief him on the background to this fraud, because, you know, if you're a police officer and you're not a climatologist,
[01:26:11.064 --> 01:26:11.844]  And it's being announced!
[01:26:38.248 --> 01:26:41.630]  It's being announced to coincide with Copenhagen.
[01:26:42.411 --> 01:26:45.033]  Absolutely, of course it was announced to coincide with Copenhagen.
[01:26:45.453 --> 01:26:49.416]  And this is clear politicking, again, of the worst kind.
[01:26:49.836 --> 01:27:05.347]  But the technical document on which that is based contains a graph lifted from a UN document and not checked, which pretends to suggest that the rate at which global warming is happening has been accelerated.
[01:27:05.934 --> 01:27:10.635]  Over the last 150 years, and particularly in recent years, in the last 25 years.
[01:27:11.035 --> 01:27:33.859]  Now that graph is based on a well-known scientific fraud, it's a statistical fraud in fact, called the end-point fallacy, where you take a stochastic data set, that's one where you have to guess which way it's going to jump next, temperature like that, it doesn't follow an ordered curve, it jiggles up and down a lot, and stochastic data sets like that are highly sensitive
[01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:38.291]  Precisely the point at which you start and end your trend line.
[01:27:38.851 --> 01:28:01.259]  And the UN has used this fact to try to convey an entirely false, entirely bogus and fraudulent impression, which has been recited over and over again by ignorant politicians, that the rate of warming is itself accelerating and the EPA, instead of checking independently, as I wrote and told it to do,
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:09.763]  Instead, just lifted this material out of the UN's, as we now know, orally-taped document without bothering to check it.
[01:28:10.064 --> 01:28:18.207]  And guess who was the lead author of the part of the document which produced this bogus graph?
[01:28:18.647 --> 01:28:22.029]  It was none other than one of the conspirators in the Climategate scandal.
[01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:29.072]  So we can tie all these people together in a series of frauds that now links in the EKA itself.
[01:28:29.614 --> 01:28:53.072]  And because the director of the EPA did not respond, she didn't even answer the submissions that I and many others put in, she herself is now going to be indicted for fraud because she's made herself part of the fraud by being warned that she was relying on documents that were themselves fraudulent, such as this graph, which is plainly fraudulent.
[01:28:53.772 --> 01:28:57.255]  And we know she used it because it's in the technical document that she published.
[01:28:57.896 --> 01:29:08.121]  And instead of withdrawing that, putting in a supplementary document saying that we still believe we're right but we can't rely on that draft anymore, she has done nothing about it.
[01:29:08.201 --> 01:29:17.066]  She has therefore become part of a very serious international scientific and financial fraud and she will have to go and go to jail.
[01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:19.212]  Amazing.
[01:29:19.252 --> 01:29:26.577]  Lord Monckton, is this not, as many researchers and scientists are billing it, the greatest scientific fraud of history?
[01:29:26.657 --> 01:29:34.062]  I mean, they're going for total world government, a takeover of the entire economy, total control of society.
[01:29:34.443 --> 01:29:35.944]  It's a fraud by design.
[01:29:35.984 --> 01:29:37.084]  They weren't mistaken.
[01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:38.465]  They knew it was a fraud.
[01:29:38.645 --> 01:29:45.430]  Answer that question on the other side of this quick break, and then we're going to go over the treaty, over what's happening in Copenhagen.
[01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:48.072]  He is there, and we're going to give you his official website.
[01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:52.698]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.598 --> 01:29:56.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:02.783]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:03.103 --> 01:30:07.186]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:07.446 --> 01:30:12.869]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:18.492]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:18.812 --> 01:30:19.352]  Number 3.
[01:30:19.632 --> 01:30:22.913]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:23.213 --> 01:30:26.914]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:27.134 --> 01:30:27.674]  Number 4.
[01:30:27.914 --> 01:30:30.295]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:30.675 --> 01:30:34.076]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:34.356 --> 01:30:34.896]  Number 5.
[01:30:35.156 --> 01:30:39.077]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:39.297 --> 01:30:44.058]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:48.385]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:48.525 --> 01:30:50.088]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.308 --> 01:30:52.392]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:30:58.988 --> 01:31:01.609]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:02.009 --> 01:31:06.971]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:07.332 --> 01:31:09.072]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:09.392 --> 01:31:14.195]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:14.375 --> 01:31:15.355]  How much do you want?
[01:31:15.575 --> 01:31:16.315]  When do you want it?
[01:31:16.696 --> 01:31:18.296]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:18.576 --> 01:31:19.397]  When will you need it?
[01:31:19.657 --> 01:31:21.718]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:21.858 --> 01:31:22.958]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:23.198 --> 01:31:24.499]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:24.719 --> 01:31:29.781]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:29.981 --> 01:31:33.163]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:33.563 --> 01:31:37.065]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:37.385 --> 01:31:38.365]  How much will you need?
[01:31:38.605 --> 01:31:39.226]  We don't know.
[01:31:39.506 --> 01:31:40.426]  How much do you want?
[01:31:40.606 --> 01:31:41.347]  All you can get.
[01:31:41.367 --> 01:31:42.207]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:42.728 --> 01:31:43.288]  We're good to go.
[01:31:57.952 --> 01:32:03.119]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:03.259 --> 01:32:07.625]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:07.805 --> 01:32:09.648]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:10.068 --> 01:32:11.430]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:11.690 --> 01:32:12.752]  There is a solution.
[01:32:12.952 --> 01:32:20.977]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:32:21.377 --> 01:32:28.441]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:34.504]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:32:34.885 --> 01:32:40.468]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:32:40.868 --> 01:32:41.529]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org
[01:33:07.355 --> 01:33:08.916]  It's Lord Monckton's excellent site.
[01:33:08.956 --> 01:33:20.100]  If you go there, you can print off the free PDF, ClimateGate caught green-handed cold facts about the hot topic of global temperature change after the ClimateGate scandal.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:23.242]  He joins us from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[01:33:23.282 --> 01:33:25.242]  In extreme demand there, obviously.
[01:33:25.483 --> 01:33:29.564]  We're very fortunate to have him with us here today.
[01:33:31.425 --> 01:33:35.247]  Lord Mocton, again, there's so many subjects to talk about.
[01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:49.094]  I want to get into the leaked treaty that you went and demanded and were able to get the latest leaked information with the Danish techs that has the third world figuring out they're being bamboozled and defrauded by this gaggle of scam artists.
[01:33:49.634 --> 01:33:51.115]  I also wanted to talk to you about
[01:33:51.855 --> 01:33:58.702]  Your ideas for the troops out there to not, you know, get orders from headquarters, but to go to the sound of the guns.
[01:33:59.043 --> 01:34:04.168]  What we can do globally to expose and fight this fraud now that we're beginning to route them.
[01:34:04.408 --> 01:34:05.730]  What about civil suits?
[01:34:06.090 --> 01:34:09.714]  You have all these scientists that were persecuted, that had their papers blocked.
[01:34:10.094 --> 01:34:11.354]  Right, I think that, of course,
[01:34:39.582 --> 01:34:45.664]  Anyone has the right to sue, but what you need to do is be very careful to use the proper procedures.
[01:34:45.804 --> 01:34:50.405]  The first thing is that we're dealing here with a criminal rather than a civil matter.
[01:34:50.906 --> 01:34:55.967]  These people have committed crimes, serious, imprisonable offenses.
[01:34:55.987 --> 01:34:58.488]  You would call them felonies rather than misdemeanors.
[01:34:58.988 --> 01:35:08.051]  These are crimes for which you can go to prison and should go to prison if you commit them for a very, very long time, particularly in view of the effect that these crimes are already having
[01:35:08.439 --> 01:35:08.979]  I don't know.
[01:35:35.973 --> 01:35:38.254]  Made with real mud, costing 3 cents each.
[01:35:38.334 --> 01:35:39.954]  Pinch of butter, pinch of salt.
[01:35:40.295 --> 01:35:42.995]  You take the mud, you mash it all up, lay it out in the sun to dry for 6,000.
[01:35:43.035 --> 01:35:44.896]  Sell it to your neighbour for 3 cents.
[01:35:45.416 --> 01:35:49.038]  That's what they're living on, or rather dying on, in Haiti now.
[01:35:49.078 --> 01:35:54.239]  I was telling this story last year to a conference of government and opposition representatives in Madrid.
[01:35:54.679 --> 01:35:56.500]  And a lady in the front row burst into tears.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:59.941]  And I said, I'm sorry to offend you, but it is a rather terrible thing that's happened.
[01:35:59.961 --> 01:36:01.862]  She said, I've just come back from Haiti.
[01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:10.816]  Now, because of the doubling of world food prices, they can't even afford the price of a mud pie, and they're dying of starvation all over the place, she said.
[01:36:11.136 --> 01:36:12.257]  And she was heartbroken.
[01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:18.981]  She said, the reason I'm crying is that you're the first person in the Western world I've ever heard mentioning the plight of the poor.
[01:36:19.461 --> 01:36:21.703]  She said, I'm so grateful, I just can't tell you.
[01:36:22.330 --> 01:36:23.851]  That's how serious this is.
[01:36:24.251 --> 01:36:29.292]  These people, by their scientific fraud and the financial fraud, they're profiting enormously.
[01:36:29.572 --> 01:36:42.636]  One of the documents from this series of leaked documents is the complete financial account of the Climate Research Unit, how much grants they've had, and how vastly the amount of grants have increased.
[01:36:43.135 --> 01:36:46.576]  And they're working with oil companies!
[01:37:11.323 --> 01:37:19.731]  Sir, going back to the question I forgot to repose at the start of the break, is this the greatest scientific fraud in history?
[01:37:20.012 --> 01:37:30.342]  A, and then B, we also now have in the emails where they're meeting with Dutch Royal Shell, with BP, with Siemens, and others saying, oh, they're
[01:37:30.822 --> 01:37:31.883]  Part of our agenda.
[01:37:32.163 --> 01:37:33.904]  This is only part of our takeover.
[01:37:34.164 --> 01:37:35.325]  This is so wonderful.
[01:37:35.605 --> 01:37:36.746]  Can you speak to this?
[01:37:37.146 --> 01:37:44.771]  Is this the biggest fraud, scientific fraud in history, A, and B, the collusion of Fortune 100 companies in this scam?
[01:37:45.371 --> 01:37:45.571]  Right.
[01:37:45.611 --> 01:37:47.532]  Let's start with that first question.
[01:37:48.073 --> 01:37:59.980]  It follows from my last answer that a fraud on an international scale, which has already killed millions by starvation, is the worst fraud you could ever possibly commit.
[01:38:00.305 --> 01:38:03.846]  The oil companies and other major corporations feverishly working with the climate scammers.
[01:38:04.146 --> 01:38:04.646]  That's right.
[01:38:04.686 --> 01:38:07.667]  This is because they've become so frightened of the United Front
[01:38:27.284 --> 01:38:33.108]  That the world's governing class has put up, saying we are going to peddle this climate nonsense regardless of whether it's true.
[01:38:33.769 --> 01:38:43.015]  That they've decided, I think cravenly, and I've told many of them so, that they'd better just give in and belong with it and try and make as much money as they can out of it.
[01:38:43.596 --> 01:38:56.905]  I think it's disgraceful and I think their shareholders, there there is a case for a civil suit, shareholders of companies who have done deals of this kind with the fraudsters of the UN and among the politicians and among the scientists, they do deserve to be sued.
[01:38:57.358 --> 01:39:04.646]  By their shareholders, for not protecting the best interests of shareholders as every director of a major corporation is required by law to do.
[01:39:05.366 --> 01:39:07.969]  So I think that is indeed a disgrace.
[01:39:08.666 --> 01:39:12.748]  But what I'd like to do, if I may, is to turn to what is in this draft treaty.
[01:39:12.768 --> 01:39:13.249]  Yes, yes.
[01:39:13.269 --> 01:39:15.990]  About the amount of money that they want to take from you.
[01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:17.311]  And, sir, let me stop you.
[01:39:17.411 --> 01:39:18.271]  Let me stop you briefly.
[01:39:18.311 --> 01:39:28.017]  For those that don't know, and I've been searching every hour and checking during the breaks, you are the only person, and you first, several months ago, ferreted out the secret draft.
[01:39:28.657 --> 01:39:30.798]  Perhaps you can remind us how you were able to get that.
[01:39:30.818 --> 01:39:37.062]  That's a friend of mine called Willie Shute at the Harvard-Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:43.944]  Who reads everything, bless him, even that which is produced by the forces of darkness in this matter.
[01:39:44.244 --> 01:39:46.806]  And he got onto the U.N., a very obscure U.N.
[01:39:46.846 --> 01:39:51.889]  website, the website of the Framework Convention on Climate Change conference of the parties.
[01:39:52.829 --> 01:40:00.514]  And he found what said it was a note by the secretariat, but he noticed it was a much too large file just to be a note.
[01:40:01.499 --> 01:40:06.684]  So he looked at the file, and it was a two-page note, but attached to it was 186 pages.
[01:40:07.044 --> 01:40:11.028]  And that was the first draft of the Treaty of Copenhagen.
[01:40:11.168 --> 01:40:14.151]  The title of the file did not say Treaty of Copenhagen.
[01:40:14.291 --> 01:40:16.193]  There was nothing to indicate what this was.
[01:40:16.433 --> 01:40:22.459]  And had he not been diligent in reading everything, spotting the size of the file, neither he nor anybody would ever have found it.
[01:40:22.559 --> 01:40:26.563]  And they would have been able to say, if we had subsequently said, oh, but we had no idea,
[01:40:27.102 --> 01:40:27.182]  Okay.
[01:40:27.202 --> 01:40:28.183]  Okay, now that said, again, recap.
[01:40:28.343 --> 01:40:29.324]  This is breaking here on air.
[01:40:29.344 --> 01:40:30.625]  You have the latest version.
[01:40:30.645 --> 01:40:32.687]  You're going to go over what's in it for everybody right now.
[01:40:32.707 --> 01:40:34.128]  This is breaking information right now.
[01:40:34.148 --> 01:40:35.809]  Lord Monckton, you have the floor.
[01:40:52.745 --> 01:40:58.626]  Now, what I'm going to do is to give you just that bit of the treaty which talks of part of the financial arrangement.
[01:40:59.007 --> 01:41:03.268]  I have never seen a treaty as expensive as this one for the West.
[01:41:03.308 --> 01:41:05.068]  It's only the West that's going to pay.
[01:41:05.728 --> 01:41:10.849]  All the third world countries have been bought, so they will sign this treaty because they think they're going to get money out of it.
[01:41:11.150 --> 01:41:13.290]  But it's going to cost the West a fortune.
[01:41:13.730 --> 01:41:14.770]  Here's what it says.
[01:41:15.271 --> 01:41:16.971]  Developed country parties.
[01:41:17.391 --> 01:41:21.092]  That's what they call countries like the United States, for instance.
[01:41:21.559 --> 01:41:29.002]  are going to have to pay a tax of anything up to 2% of gross national product.
[01:41:29.022 --> 01:41:32.604]  To give you an idea of how big that is, for instance, that's half the U.S.
[01:41:32.644 --> 01:41:33.344]  defence budget.
[01:41:33.745 --> 01:41:40.088]  That's how much they are going to confiscate to fund this vast new government that they're setting up.
[01:41:40.128 --> 01:41:46.931]  I haven't yet counted how many interlocked new bureaucracies there are to constitute this government, but I think it's around 700.
[01:41:46.971 --> 01:41:49.732]  I'm going to try and do a more exact count later.
[01:41:50.342 --> 01:41:55.726]  Then they're going to be levied on their greenhouse gas emissions.
[01:41:56.327 --> 01:42:00.090]  They're going to auction allowances to emit greenhouse gases.
[01:42:00.110 --> 01:42:04.173]  And if you don't buy an allowance to emit greenhouse gases, you won't be allowed to emit them.
[01:42:04.433 --> 01:42:13.020]  You could find that your local electricity company has to shut down because it can't afford to buy the right to emit this harmless gas into the atmosphere.
[01:42:13.661 --> 01:42:18.645]  There's also going to be a uniform global levy of $2 per tonne.
[01:42:20.367 --> 01:42:20.908]  Of course.
[01:42:49.966 --> 01:42:53.988]  Giving money to third world countries, they're going to tax the money they're going to hand out.
[01:42:54.528 --> 01:42:59.750]  There's also going to be a global levy on international monetary transactions.
[01:42:59.790 --> 01:43:04.452]  That means every transfer of money across borders will be taxed.
[01:43:04.572 --> 01:43:09.654]  They no longer say, as they did in the original draft, what rate that tax was at, but they keep in mind 2%.
[01:43:09.854 --> 01:43:14.236]  That's on top of the 2% tax of GDP that they're going to charge anyway.
[01:43:14.736 --> 01:43:16.057]  There's also going to be
[01:43:16.673 --> 01:43:27.662]  Get this, penalties or fines for non-compliance of developed country parties, that's the United States, etc., with their emission reduction and financial resources commitments.
[01:43:27.762 --> 01:43:45.577]  That means if you don't cut your economy down to size and cut your carbon emissions, or if you don't pay the vast amounts of money that I've just read out for these various categories, which admittedly some of them are listed as options, but nevertheless, we're looking at very, very serious amounts of money here.
[01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:49.709]  Then there will be a police force effectively.
[01:43:50.070 --> 01:44:05.059]  This government will have the right for the first time ever in an international organisation to enforce its will by imposing unlimited financial penalties on any countries whose performance under this treaty they don't like.
[01:44:05.802 --> 01:44:10.085]  Now, I could go on and on and on and on, because there's pages and pages of this.
[01:44:10.585 --> 01:44:16.649]  There's an adaptation fund, a multilateral adaptation fund, solidarity funds, litigation funds, multilateral climate technology funds.
[01:44:16.789 --> 01:44:19.110]  A total global government takeover.
[01:44:19.130 --> 01:44:21.051]  Global government, sir.
[01:44:21.471 --> 01:44:23.373]  Is this total global government?
[01:44:23.953 --> 01:44:28.155]  This is total global government, but on a scale which is simply unimaginable.
[01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:28.856]  I mean, the cost
[01:44:29.665 --> 01:44:34.166]  Of all these extra boards and panels and technology funds and this and that.
[01:44:34.406 --> 01:44:41.668]  That's going to come out of general taxpayers' money over and above the various individual financial provisions I've just read out.
[01:44:42.088 --> 01:44:53.090]  We're looking at a grab for absolute power and absolute financial control worldwide by the UN and its associated bureaucracies and 700 new bureaucracies.
[01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:55.470]  And I'm not talking about 700 new bureaucrats.
[01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:58.151]  I'm talking about 700 new bureaucratic bodies.
[01:44:59.142 --> 01:45:03.823]  And global authorities over travel, tracking where everybody goes, expanding on that.
[01:45:03.883 --> 01:45:10.024]  Now we have the Danish leaked memo that they've been passing around, and I have that draft here, and it talks about
[01:45:27.327 --> 01:45:27.727]  They want the U.N.
[01:45:27.747 --> 01:45:28.868]  to run everything because the U.N.
[01:45:28.888 --> 01:45:29.349]  that they now see
[01:45:57.003 --> 01:46:03.869]  As simply a sort of socialist cash generating machine, a cash cow for third world countries.
[01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:14.759]  The UN no longer serves any purpose except first its own enrichment and then a little bit of trickle down after it's spent all that it wants on its own vast bureaucracies.
[01:46:14.839 --> 01:46:19.383]  You know, there are 200 of those already, at least 200 represented here at this conference.
[01:46:19.603 --> 01:46:20.243]  Unbelievable.
[01:46:21.244 --> 01:46:22.005]  Alphabet soup.
[01:46:22.478 --> 01:46:23.619]  We're good to go.
[01:46:47.890 --> 01:46:54.432]  And so they're trying to buy, the UN is trying to buy these third world countries by saying, well, we're going to really make the developed countries pay.
[01:46:54.892 --> 01:47:10.398]  And the reason the third world countries are now so annoyed with the Danish draft, which was simply intended to try and facilitate agreement, but it got out into the Guardian before it had done its job, and therefore the Guardian has rather blown the negotiations out into the open.
[01:47:11.338 --> 01:47:16.300]  The reason why the third world countries are annoyed about this is because it isn't their friend, the UN.
[01:47:17.668 --> 01:47:23.030]  It's the much stiffer, much more business-like World Bank and IMF.
[01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:44.138]  Now, of course, the trouble is that from the point of view of Western countries, whether it's the UN or the World Bank and the IMF that's running this world government, one astonishing characteristic, and I've looked right through this treaty and I can confirm this, it's just the same as in the previous draft, the word election, democracy, ballot, vote does not appear anywhere.
[01:47:44.458 --> 01:47:45.639]  The one thing that's quite clear
[01:47:46.244 --> 01:48:00.172]  is that these enormous powers of taxation and interference, enormous powers of levying this and taxing that and funding the other, are all going to be without any representation at all.
[01:48:00.192 --> 01:48:10.858]  Now the old principle, as you know well, on which the US Constitution is founded, is that there should be no taxation of any citizen unless the body taxing that citizen
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:11.460]  Yes.
[01:48:30.376 --> 01:48:35.918]  The EU Commissars who now run the European Union and make 90% of our laws.
[01:48:35.958 --> 01:48:37.118]  We have a Parliament of course.
[01:48:37.418 --> 01:48:39.019]  It's more or less completely redundant.
[01:48:39.099 --> 01:48:41.520]  We might as well let it go to the Thames.
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:55.685]  But they're now trying to use that model and have it on an international scale with no election, no ballot, no vote, no right to call these people to account, no right to question them, no right to remove them, no right to replace them.
[01:48:56.065 --> 01:48:58.406]  This is a threat to democracy worldwide.
[01:48:58.886 --> 01:49:12.195]  So when the United Nations says this is the greatest moment for world government, this is the year of the establishment of global governance as the head of the EU and as Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN, Secretary General, has said, they really mean it.
[01:49:12.936 --> 01:49:15.557]  And so we now stand here at the precipice.
[01:49:15.617 --> 01:49:17.299]  You are there in Copenhagen.
[01:49:17.619 --> 01:49:18.860]  Here's the big question.
[01:49:19.858 --> 01:49:25.700]  Looking at this, being inside of it, watching it, what do you predict is going to happen?
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:32.403]  And if we lose this and they do get it ratified, then we start fighting it at the national level.
[01:49:33.183 --> 01:49:34.163]  What do you see happening?
[01:49:35.604 --> 01:49:37.785]  Let me tell you what worries me about all this.
[01:49:38.685 --> 01:49:44.607]  What worries me is that this treaty has been through several negotiating rounds.
[01:49:45.603 --> 01:50:03.966]  And yet, although they've taken out the word government, because I've screamed at them, and you've screamed at them, and everybody's screamed at them, all the mechanisms of government, all the funding sources, the funding streams, as they call them, or funding windows in the latest phrase, sound very coy, but actually it means ways of raiding the taxpayer's pocket.
[01:50:04.566 --> 01:50:11.448]  All of these things are still in place, and have not only survived the previous draft, but have been considerably amplified.
[01:50:12.288 --> 01:50:13.208]  So what we're looking
[01:50:14.085 --> 01:50:16.226]  I'm afraid there's no other way of putting this.
[01:50:16.426 --> 01:50:30.972]  It is a worldwide conspiracy by the governing class against the governed, by the big boys against the little guy, by the rich against the poor, by the strong against the weak.
[01:50:31.612 --> 01:50:41.096]  And if you're a little guy doing your honest job of work to protect and pay for your family, you have good reason to be very frightened at this moment.
[01:50:41.596 --> 01:50:42.917]  And if you think that
[01:50:43.882 --> 01:50:53.590]  Our kind host and I have been winding each other up and frothing at the mouth about something that's just another global government conspiracy theory.
[01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:55.772]  I just have three words for you.
[01:50:56.212 --> 01:50:57.753]  Read the treaty.
[01:50:58.094 --> 01:51:09.202]  After a lot of the fuss I've made, there is a chance that by now, if you go onto the UN Framework Convention website, which I think is unfccc.int,
[01:51:10.512 --> 01:51:18.478]  Then you may be able to find this treaty now in draft, because I have made quite a big stink about it not being immediately available when I asked.
[01:51:19.238 --> 01:51:23.341]  I think they have been shamed now into putting this up on the web.
[01:51:23.381 --> 01:51:25.223]  It'll probably still be quite hard to find.
[01:51:25.423 --> 01:51:37.732]  Why don't you all have a look if you doubt in any way what I've been saying to you about the magnitude and breadth of the scope of this treaty, the powers and the wealth
[01:51:38.308 --> 01:51:54.658]  But it will transfer from you and your country to an alien, unelected, communistic bureaucracy with power to control all free markets worldwide, with the power to levy taxes on every financial transaction that crosses the international border.
[01:51:54.919 --> 01:52:01.663]  We're looking at an enormous, enormous, communistic government which
[01:52:02.392 --> 01:52:14.202]  In its sheer scale, it's disproportionate to any conceivable threat from CO2, particularly now that we know by measurement that all of the US models were wrong and CO2 is simply harmless.
[01:52:14.782 --> 01:52:18.445]  It's an outrage and I'd like to tell you, if I may, what you should do about it.
[01:52:19.406 --> 01:52:30.355]  As soon as you have finished listening to this programme, you must dive for the telephone and you must telephone the US Senate and you must demand to speak to your senator
[01:52:30.905 --> 01:52:32.585]  Or to one of his senior staffers.
[01:52:32.705 --> 01:52:37.867]  Do not be farmed off with a receptionist, a switchboard operator, a secretary or an intern.
[01:52:38.307 --> 01:52:54.171]  You must speak to a senior staffer or to the senator himself and you must bring both of the senators for your state and they'll tell you on the switchboard who those senators are and you must say the Treaty of Copenhagen shall not pass.
[01:52:54.691 --> 01:53:00.352]  The more of you do this, the more vigorously you do it, the more plainly but always politely
[01:53:00.953 --> 01:53:09.098]  You put your point to your senator and to his senior staff, the more likely it is that the Senate will refuse to ratify the treaty.
[01:53:09.798 --> 01:53:29.650]  And even though there are various backdoor ways by which Obama has already said via his staff during the election campaign that he would try to circumvent your constitution by going round the back and allowing the treaty to be enacted into domestic law by a simple majority of both houses,
[01:53:30.094 --> 01:53:42.281]  Or simply by signing it by his executive authority and then using his majority on the Supreme Court to say that that's the way the trend in law is moving and therefore we'll count that as though it were a valid treaty.
[01:53:42.521 --> 01:53:47.204]  And the present Supreme Court will do that, you know, if you give it half a chance.
[01:53:47.544 --> 01:53:58.410]  And you need to make absolutely sure that your senators are told this treaty shall not pass so that if any of these backdoor ways of pushing the treaty through against the will of the Senate
[01:53:58.937 --> 01:53:59.558]  I think so.
[01:54:22.028 --> 01:54:30.892]  Because once he signs that treaty, and with his Nobel Peace Prize, and the millions of keening zombies screaming at him here in Copenhagen, he will sign anything.
[01:54:31.453 --> 01:54:34.474]  Once that happens, then it's bye-bye to your constitution.
[01:54:34.854 --> 01:54:40.617]  It's bye-bye to the freedom which America has long been a beacon to the world.
[01:54:40.737 --> 01:54:42.778]  It has offered this beacon of freedom to the world.
[01:54:43.118 --> 01:54:50.742]  Now, you are in immediate peril of losing that freedom, however extreme what I'm saying to you may sound.
[01:54:51.306 --> 01:54:53.428]  Every word of it is verifiably true.
[01:54:54.088 --> 01:55:09.661]  That is the intention of your, and I'm going to call it this, your communist president and your communist administration, your communist science advisor, who only 25 years ago was saying that there would be such a global cooling caused by mankind.
[01:55:10.137 --> 01:55:19.260]  That ice will accumulate on the Antarctic and it will tilt into the sea and cause a tidal wave bigger than any in human history, wiping out all coastal communities worldwide.
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:24.681]  Now he says that global warming will cause exactly the same sea level rise and wipe out coastal communities worldwide.
[01:55:25.181 --> 01:55:26.122]  All of this is going on.
[01:55:26.162 --> 01:55:27.382]  These people are communists.
[01:55:27.762 --> 01:55:31.503]  They do not have the best interests of you or your country at heart.
[01:55:31.983 --> 01:55:33.944]  I would not normally speak in this way.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.361]  About your elected administration.
[01:55:36.641 --> 01:55:41.284]  But frankly, I think you were misled into believing that there was going to be change you could believe in.
[01:55:41.744 --> 01:55:45.627]  This is change on a scale that is simply almost unbelievable.
[01:55:45.927 --> 01:55:47.188]  But that is what is threatened.
[01:55:47.508 --> 01:55:51.730]  Unless you use your last day of freedom to stop it.
[01:55:52.131 --> 01:55:58.515]  Because once this treaty goes through, you can ring your senator, you can vote him in, you can vote him out, you can vote for a different president.
[01:55:58.815 --> 01:56:00.276]  It won't make any difference.
[01:56:00.776 --> 01:56:02.457]  Once this treaty binds your nation,
[01:56:05.352 --> 01:56:08.934]  That's another key point.
[01:56:09.274 --> 01:56:15.598]  Does the latest treaty still have the wording that there has to be unanimous vote by all the parties to let your country leave?
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:29.874]  At the moment there is no wording that allows you to leave unilaterally, and therefore the usual provision in international treaties under the Vienna Convention prevails, which is there has to be a unanimous vote of all other parties to let you out.
[01:56:30.454 --> 01:56:37.642]  There are many amendments that need to be put into this treaty, but of course it isn't yet there, despite our having raised this with previous drafts.
[01:56:38.223 --> 01:56:41.244]  Lord Christopher Monckton, we're coming down to the end.
[01:56:41.264 --> 01:56:42.825]  I want to say bye to you here at the break.
[01:56:43.145 --> 01:56:46.946]  You've agreed that at the end of Copenhagen to pop back in with a final report.
[01:56:47.446 --> 01:56:54.889]  But as you said, this is a complete world government takeover from Ban Ki-moon's own mouth, from the head of the EU's own mouth.
[01:56:56.010 --> 01:56:57.351]  This is really happening.
[01:56:57.791 --> 01:56:59.432]  Total global control grid.
[01:56:59.452 --> 01:57:02.034]  Al Gore says it's not enough.
[01:57:02.094 --> 01:57:04.276]  He wants even more of our money.
[01:57:04.356 --> 01:57:05.697]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:57:05.757 --> 01:57:08.819]  These are piratical thieves.
[01:57:09.659 --> 01:57:13.342]  And we are two seconds to midnight, as you have so eloquently said.
[01:57:14.182 --> 01:57:18.024]  But the fraud has been exposed, but it appears they don't care.
[01:57:18.104 --> 01:57:22.766]  They're just going to go forward establishing this carbon dioxide dictatorship.
[01:57:23.007 --> 01:57:26.869]  They know that gas is involved in all human activity, all life.
[01:57:27.369 --> 01:57:31.311]  And by picking that gas, they have a total dictatorship.
[01:57:31.691 --> 01:57:38.775]  I mean, this is the dawn of a new dark age with these control freaks preparing to bring us all in as chattel slaves.
[01:57:39.915 --> 01:57:43.617]  And hysterical though that may sound, it is hysterical though it does sound.
[01:57:44.156 --> 01:57:51.962]  Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, if you're listening tonight, every word of what your kind host has said is regrettably true.
[01:57:52.062 --> 01:57:57.746]  It breaks my heart to say it, and I beg you, get onto your senator while you still can.
[01:57:58.026 --> 01:58:00.108]  You only have 10 days of freedom left.
[01:58:00.648 --> 01:58:08.094]  Already there have been scientists like James Hansen saying that anyone who argues, as I have argued, should be put on trial and executed.
[01:58:13.359 --> 01:58:15.920]  Yes, they want to execute.
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:18.602]  They want to kill people that don't agree with them.
[01:58:18.622 --> 01:58:20.323]  Lord Monckton, let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:58:20.663 --> 01:58:22.824]  I really appreciate the time.
[01:58:22.944 --> 01:58:29.909]  Fire out your website for folks.
[01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.950]  Well, stay there.
[01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:32.530]  We've got a break.
[01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:33.331]  We've got a break, sir.
[01:58:33.551 --> 01:58:34.391]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:35.252]  This is key info.
[01:58:35.512 --> 01:58:35.972]  Stay with us.
[01:58:36.012 --> 01:58:36.893]  Lord Christopher Monckton.
[01:58:41.184 --> 01:58:42.705]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.645 --> 01:58:46.066]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.527 --> 01:58:55.370]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:57.451]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:58:57.591 --> 01:58:59.712]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:58:59.832 --> 01:59:01.353]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:59:51.606 --> 01:59:53.527]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:53.987 --> 01:59:56.770]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:07.503]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:08.143 --> 02:00:08.964]  You want answers?
[02:00:09.724 --> 02:00:10.665]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:11.305 --> 02:00:14.968]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.468 --> 02:00:17.810]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:18.710 --> 02:00:19.551]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.911 --> 02:00:24.254]  Don't forget, my friends, my film, Fall of the Republic, is free online.
[02:00:24.294 --> 02:00:25.735]  Just Google Fall of the Republic.
[02:00:26.155 --> 02:00:27.476]  Watch it on YouTube, Google.
[02:00:27.796 --> 02:00:32.279]  Get it in high quality on DVD at Infowars.com, especially if you want to support us.
[02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:37.963]  A full hour of this explains the banking dictatorship using carbon tax to control our planet.
[02:00:38.364 --> 02:00:45.989]  Lord Mockton's with us for an additional four minutes to finish his point, and then I want to ask him about the prostitutes, the caviar, the jets,
[02:00:46.429 --> 02:00:46.770]  Yes, indeed.
[02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:51.514]  In fact, I was just saying, God bless America, which I'll cheerfully say again.
[02:00:51.574 --> 02:00:52.515]  But let's take up your point.
[02:00:52.595 --> 02:00:54.177]  There are 1,200 limousine carbon-emitting
[02:01:09.864 --> 02:01:16.426]  to drive the delegates around because it's too cold for them to walk to the Global Warming Conference.
[02:01:16.587 --> 02:01:32.072]  The nice irony there, just as most of the United States is blanketed in snow to a further point south than has been seen in recent history or in some places in history at all, here we are shivering in Copenhagen to 1,200 gas-guzzling limos, 140 private jets.
[02:01:32.392 --> 02:01:34.573]  Hey, I didn't even come in my private jet.
[02:01:34.633 --> 02:01:36.894]  All six of them are out for service at the moment.
[02:01:37.334 --> 02:01:37.875]  I came by
[02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:41.467]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:14.289]  ...in the conference chamber are calling it Dopenhagen, and of course those delegates are then rushing off down to the red light district and having fun with the prostitutes, exactly as you said, using their limos to get them there, and I suppose we might call that Gropenhagen.
[02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:17.992]  But either way, it is a disgrace what's going on.
[02:02:18.512 --> 02:02:26.157]  It shows that what is really happening here is one law for the rich and one for the poor, one for the governing class and one for the rest of us.
[02:02:26.826 --> 02:02:32.867]  They are not cutting their carbon footprint, but my goodness, they're going to charge you through the nose if you don't cut yours.
[02:02:33.607 --> 02:02:43.869]  So this is an asymmetrical conference here, which is the governing class supported by the tens of thousands of cheating zombies from the environmental movement.
[02:02:44.169 --> 02:02:45.709]  Enviro-zombs, as I call them.
[02:02:45.729 --> 02:02:47.550]  They like to shorten all their words, so I'll do it.
[02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:48.610]  They're Enviro-zombs.
[02:02:49.450 --> 02:02:56.191]  And these people are going to take away everything that is dear to us in your Constitution.
[02:02:56.684 --> 02:02:58.066]  Every element of your freedom.
[02:02:58.847 --> 02:03:00.449]  Every chance of prosperity.
[02:03:00.689 --> 02:03:03.473]  Every chance of recovery from the present economic recession.
[02:03:03.533 --> 02:03:04.775]  Because they want control!
[02:03:06.217 --> 02:03:08.079]  They want absolute control.
[02:03:08.099 --> 02:03:13.987]  This is nothing less than a bureaucratic coup d'etat which is days from succeeding.
[02:03:15.287 --> 02:03:17.488]  By the way, there was an article in the London Telegraph today.
[02:03:17.868 --> 02:03:18.528]  Climategate.
[02:03:18.608 --> 02:03:25.691]  Barack Obama's rule by EPA decree is a coup d'etat against Congress made in Britain.
[02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:32.154]  And during the break, you made a parallel the last time Copenhagen had this much propaganda was when the SS were in control.
[02:03:33.054 --> 02:03:33.534]  That's right.
[02:03:33.674 --> 02:03:37.696]  Everywhere, there are... They're now green instead of red, white and black.
[02:03:38.276 --> 02:03:42.118]  But there are banners everywhere that are deeply reminiscent of the SS.
[02:03:42.788 --> 02:03:47.211]  And they, of course, occupied Copenhagen and Denmark as a whole during the war.
[02:03:47.492 --> 02:04:00.782]  And Denmark, to do it credit, thanks to its king and the guts of its people, managed to make sure that practically no Jews got sent from Denmark to the gas chambers, because the people of Denmark stood by the Jews in the most remarkable, wonderful way.
[02:04:01.162 --> 02:04:07.767]  But now Denmark's leaders are among the worst offenders in signing away the freedoms
[02:04:08.191 --> 02:04:11.672]  Well they just kill you by starving you to death!
[02:04:11.912 --> 02:04:15.693]  They just kill you like Stalin did in the Ukraine by cutting off your food!
[02:04:38.504 --> 02:04:38.784]  Lord Monckton.
[02:04:38.804 --> 02:04:39.425]  We're out of time.
[02:04:39.445 --> 02:04:39.825]  Godspeed.
[02:04:40.325 --> 02:04:41.986]  Godspeed, sir, there in Copenhagen.
[02:04:42.006 --> 02:04:43.928]  Thank you so much for all your time.
[02:04:44.248 --> 02:04:45.229]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.527 --> 02:05:02.750]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:03.070 --> 02:05:03.691]  Number one.
[02:05:03.991 --> 02:05:07.153]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:07.413 --> 02:05:07.994]  Number two.
[02:05:08.274 --> 02:05:12.817]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:13.157 --> 02:05:13.618]  It's true.
[02:05:13.918 --> 02:05:18.481]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:18.782 --> 02:05:19.242]  Number three.
[02:05:19.582 --> 02:05:22.885]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:23.165 --> 02:05:27.348]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:27.889 --> 02:05:30.270]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:30.651 --> 02:05:33.993]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.114 --> 02:05:39.036]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:39.256 --> 02:05:44.038]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:44.318 --> 02:05:48.339]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:48.479 --> 02:05:50.040]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:54.882]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:05:59.258 --> 02:06:04.461]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[02:06:23.772 --> 02:06:27.896]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.

[02:06:59.494 --> 02:07:03.156]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:03.496 --> 02:07:06.497]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:06.737 --> 02:07:11.519]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:11.539 --> 02:07:17.762]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:17.922 --> 02:07:20.183]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:20.683 --> 02:07:20.983]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:21.003 --> 02:07:21.443]  Bernanke?
[02:07:21.523 --> 02:07:22.123]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:22.143 --> 02:07:22.844]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:22.864 --> 02:07:24.984]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:39.608 --> 02:07:46.577]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:07:46.897 --> 02:07:56.009]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:08:03.832 --> 02:08:04.472]  Big Brother.
[02:08:05.153 --> 02:08:06.173]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:06.913 --> 02:08:08.014]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:08.674 --> 02:08:09.474]  You want answers?
[02:08:10.255 --> 02:08:11.195]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:11.215 --> 02:08:15.497]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.997 --> 02:08:20.039]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.159 --> 02:08:27.682]  You could hear Lord Monckton literally frothing, wanting to warn you and tell you what's in the treaties.
[02:08:27.822 --> 02:08:34.225]  We have the first draft, we now have the second draft, global government, taxes on everything, the UN says it's global government.
[02:08:35.706 --> 02:08:41.028]  Reading the original treaty, I knew the IMF and World Bank would run it all secretly and you'd pay your tax to them.
[02:08:41.348 --> 02:08:43.069]  That's what the bankers said 20 years ago.
[02:08:43.529 --> 02:08:48.792]  So now the third world's freaking out going, well we, we've been taught to hate the West.
[02:08:50.183 --> 02:08:53.646]  And we've been taught that we're going to get all the middle class's money, but wait a minute.
[02:08:54.006 --> 02:08:59.290]  The same banks, the IMF and World Bank that raped our countries, they're going to have control of this?
[02:09:00.351 --> 02:09:01.892]  We thought we were going to get the power.
[02:09:03.153 --> 02:09:05.815]  See, that's how the scam works, but now in the internal
[02:09:06.934 --> 02:09:07.514]  Memos.
[02:09:08.535 --> 02:09:13.916]  London Guardian reports Copenhagen Climate Summit in disarray after Danish techs leak.
[02:09:14.437 --> 02:09:24.460]  Developing countries react furiously to leaked draft agreement that would hand more power to rich nations, sideline the UN's negotiating role, and abandon the Kyoto Protocol.
[02:09:25.185 --> 02:09:33.952]  This is just going to be the private central bank's holding company, Federal Reserve, IMF, World Bank, Bank of England, Bundesbank, literally raping everyone.
[02:09:34.252 --> 02:09:35.313]  They will set the rules.
[02:09:35.633 --> 02:09:36.614]  They will administer it.
[02:09:37.515 --> 02:09:41.678]  You think the banks are happy with $23.7 trillion they stole in the U.S.?
[02:09:42.559 --> 02:09:43.560]  $50 trillion worldwide?
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:44.781]  Plus?
[02:09:45.141 --> 02:09:48.744]  No, they want the direct power, the direct authority.
[02:09:49.124 --> 02:09:52.467]  As David Rockefeller said, a world government run by international banks.
[02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:58.695]  And now we have the internal communiques of what they're going to add in the next week and a half.
[02:09:59.175 --> 02:10:00.076]  World government.
[02:10:00.096 --> 02:10:05.100]  This is like the opposite of the Declaration of Independence, where the founders met for weeks hammering it out.
[02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:18.232]  This is the founders of the global tyranny who've set up this whole system, got their propaganda ready, already have a lot of their world taxes in place, openly saying, nations, sign on to be under our dictatorial, unelected control.
[02:10:19.614 --> 02:10:30.743]  It's happening right now, and there is a TED conference and all these other big scientific conferences working with the media to craft the propaganda the UN admits.
[02:10:31.043 --> 02:10:35.947]  They're running around organizing all this behind the scenes, brainwashing your kids in public schools.
[02:10:36.427 --> 02:10:38.429]  I mean, this is so monstrous.
[02:10:38.489 --> 02:10:39.509]  As Lord Monckton said,
[02:10:40.530 --> 02:10:47.600]  And to hear his passion, to know this is happening, to know our countries are falling to this, to know this is world government!
[02:10:48.301 --> 02:10:55.211]  The globalists stalled the public, telling you none of this existed, so we couldn't build organizations to fight it, when they finally brought this in.
[02:10:56.465 --> 02:11:04.753]  But more leaks are coming out, more documents are coming out, more people are seeing this for the tyranny it is, even inside the system, and are saying no.
[02:11:05.353 --> 02:11:07.696]  And you guys said you printed it for me, but I couldn't find it.
[02:11:08.036 --> 02:11:13.201]  I want that Gore Vidal story again that's up on InfoWars.com that Aaron Dykes posted.
[02:11:14.755 --> 02:11:24.101]  Great folks in the forum found the Playboy interview he did calling for forced population reduction, one-child policies, a global authority, a global government to license.
[02:11:24.521 --> 02:11:26.002]  Same thing that's in Ecoscience.
[02:11:26.402 --> 02:11:29.384]  Same thing that's in hundreds of books that these people write.
[02:11:29.745 --> 02:11:31.105]  This is what they want.
[02:11:31.386 --> 02:11:32.867]  They want you starving to death.
[02:11:32.947 --> 02:11:34.087]  They want you dying.
[02:11:34.408 --> 02:11:35.909]  They see you as a parasite.
[02:11:36.369 --> 02:11:43.954]  I played the winner of the Berlin Film Festival that they show kids in public schools worldwide where humans are called a disease, a parasite.
[02:11:44.454 --> 02:11:46.155]  That is what the elites believe.
[02:11:46.836 --> 02:11:50.799]  But I want to play you this propaganda piece from TED Conference.
[02:11:51.199 --> 02:11:56.904]  First, they're talking in the conference about how they get their headlines right and how global warming's real and, oh, aren't they good?
[02:11:56.924 --> 02:11:58.205]  And they're all a bunch of useful idiots.
[02:11:58.465 --> 02:11:59.706]  Most of them aren't involved in the fraud.
[02:11:59.726 --> 02:12:00.366]  They just believe it.
[02:12:00.666 --> 02:12:02.428]  Just like Nazis believed Hitler was good.
[02:12:02.808 --> 02:12:04.589]  Or Soviets believed Stalin was good.
[02:12:04.890 --> 02:12:06.731]  Or Chinese believed Mao was good.
[02:12:06.751 --> 02:12:07.552]  They were conned.
[02:12:08.905 --> 02:12:21.235]  Then it cuts to, oh, if we have tracker boxes in all your cars and track everywhere you go, that will end traffic and save the earth, and tax you and track you, and Obama's now proposing this in the U.S.
[02:12:22.616 --> 02:12:23.677]  This is happening!
[02:12:24.197 --> 02:12:25.638]  Do you—you heard Lord Monckton.
[02:12:25.878 --> 02:12:29.161]  By stealth, they're implementing it at the state and regional level already.
[02:12:30.302 --> 02:12:30.482]  I mean,
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:35.022]  It's so incredible, that's why I keep plugging Fall of the Republic.
[02:12:35.702 --> 02:12:43.307]  Two hour, 24 minute film, a full hour of it exposes the whole climate fraud, the global government, the private tax to bankers, their own statements.
[02:12:43.667 --> 02:12:45.229]  People are ready to see the truth.

[02:13:06.571 --> 02:13:09.353]  I'm going to go out to break with this propaganda.
[02:13:36.055 --> 02:13:42.181]  And then we're going to come back and start taking calls and getting into all these... I mean, it's just the developments are so huge.
[02:13:42.681 --> 02:13:46.044]  And the new leaked documents about how banks are going to run this are so huge.
[02:13:46.344 --> 02:13:50.088]  I mean, it's old news to you, but here it is mainstream media, and we've got an even clearer picture here.
[02:13:50.608 --> 02:13:50.908]  So... 1-800-259-9231.
[02:13:50.928 --> 02:13:53.771]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:13:53.791 --> 02:13:54.472]  Here is the propaganda piece.
[02:14:05.603 --> 02:14:06.768]  Meanwhile, Gore is going to save us.
[02:14:17.165 --> 02:14:22.389]  I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper.
[02:14:23.089 --> 02:14:28.493]  Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.
[02:14:28.813 --> 02:14:31.275]  They're both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.
[02:14:32.035 --> 02:14:39.440]  Recently, the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system.
[02:14:40.001 --> 02:14:41.682]  That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.
[02:14:41.702 --> 02:14:43.363]  They wrote almost 1,000 pages on the topic.
[02:14:46.745 --> 02:14:47.626]  All right, let's stop right there.
[02:15:13.717 --> 02:15:15.698]  The UN was caught last week.
[02:15:16.138 --> 02:15:19.380]  The mainstream news, we covered it here, AP, Fox, you name it, covered it.
[02:15:20.841 --> 02:15:26.444]  They went out and hired socialists and communists, scientists, and got them to lie.
[02:15:27.584 --> 02:15:35.689]  And now NOAA's been caught, NASA's been caught, the government research centers in Australia, in Canada, in England, they've all been caught!
[02:15:37.142 --> 02:15:39.784]  They just... I mean, they tell you polar bears can't swim, folks!
[02:15:40.385 --> 02:15:41.846]  They tell you penguins can't swim!
[02:15:41.886 --> 02:15:43.147]  They tell you the Arctic melted!
[02:15:43.347 --> 02:15:44.108]  It got bigger!
[02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:47.250]  They just lie!
[02:15:48.111 --> 02:15:52.915]  There's hundreds of thousands of climatologists and hydrologists and meteorologists.
[02:15:52.935 --> 02:15:53.696]  They went and hired 600!
[02:15:56.308 --> 02:15:57.869]  People on government payroll.
[02:15:58.609 --> 02:15:59.889]  But it's not communism.
[02:15:59.929 --> 02:16:01.270]  The low levels are communist.
[02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:02.170]  They believe it.
[02:16:02.590 --> 02:16:04.111]  They believe they're lying for a good reason.
[02:16:04.551 --> 02:16:05.451]  It's the banks!
[02:16:05.811 --> 02:16:07.152]  They want a monopoly!
[02:16:07.552 --> 02:16:08.312]  Don't you get it?
[02:16:08.372 --> 02:16:09.073]  It's serfdom!
[02:16:09.133 --> 02:16:09.873]  It's slavery!
[02:16:11.305 --> 02:16:12.785]  Let's just go back to her.
[02:16:12.825 --> 02:16:13.546]  She's so sick.
[02:16:13.666 --> 02:16:13.986]  Here it is.
[02:16:33.072 --> 02:16:35.734]  It's a small organic molecule, probably never heard of it.
[02:16:36.014 --> 02:16:40.318]  The weight of a paperclip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion, 10 to the 21st.
[02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:42.199]  See, they're gonna tax everything.
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:46.923]  But, despite its very small weight... Thousands of molecules, just a total raping.
[02:16:46.963 --> 02:16:49.285]  ...to equal the weight of all the people on the planet.
[02:16:49.705 --> 02:16:50.786]  It's a huge amount of stuff.
[02:16:50.846 --> 02:16:51.947]  It's equal to the weight of methane.
[02:16:52.267 --> 02:16:55.269]  And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system.
[02:16:55.749 --> 02:16:59.852]  Because it's important for the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing.
[02:17:00.172 --> 02:17:01.733]  We blow it up and look at the pieces.
[02:17:01.793 --> 02:17:03.614]  This is the U4 smog chamber in Spain.
[02:17:04.115 --> 02:17:08.137]  Atmospheric explosions... Methane's always been released by life!
[02:17:08.157 --> 02:17:10.659]  Methane's part of the atmosphere!
[02:17:11.039 --> 02:17:13.341]  We run enormous models on supercomputers.
[02:17:13.361 --> 02:17:14.481]  This is what I happen to do.
[02:17:14.862 --> 02:17:18.444]  Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes covered with hundreds of variables each.
[02:17:19.324 --> 02:17:21.125]  We know about those computer programs!
[02:17:21.485 --> 02:17:23.006]  We now have copies of them!
[02:17:46.477 --> 02:17:49.099]  And on part of that field campaign, we even brought an aircraft with us.
[02:17:49.339 --> 02:17:55.282]  And this plane, the model BA146, which is run by FAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people.
[02:17:55.362 --> 02:17:57.504]  So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.
[02:17:57.944 --> 02:17:58.965]  But we didn't just fly it.
[02:17:59.305 --> 02:18:02.647]  We were flying it 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule.
[02:18:02.947 --> 02:18:04.068]  Incredibly dangerous stuff.
[02:18:04.288 --> 02:18:07.050]  We have to fly on a special incline in order to make the measurements.
[02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.570]  We hired...
[02:18:08.646 --> 02:18:10.107]  Just all a bunch of flim flam.
[02:18:10.367 --> 02:18:12.568]  Look, I'm a heroic chick.
[02:18:13.029 --> 02:18:14.409]  I'm like a superhero.
[02:18:14.730 --> 02:18:15.830]  Look, science!
[02:18:16.331 --> 02:18:17.471]  Methane from cows!
[02:18:17.931 --> 02:18:18.572]  It's evil!
[02:18:18.592 --> 02:18:23.215]  I mean, these people are taking over everything!
[02:18:24.755 --> 02:18:26.837]  It's a complete sick joke!
[02:18:27.037 --> 02:18:28.017]  They're parasites!
[02:18:28.257 --> 02:18:29.458]  They like running your life!
[02:18:29.718 --> 02:18:30.799]  They're control freaks!
[02:18:31.159 --> 02:18:33.881]  Don't you understand there's always people that want to dominate others?
[02:18:35.575 --> 02:18:36.795]  And that's what's being set up.
[02:18:37.156 --> 02:18:43.158]  A criminal world government with a couple thousand scientists hired by the UN.
[02:18:43.518 --> 02:18:46.760]  We have their internal documents where they go hire people for their agenda.
[02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:50.721]  With the big banks, with the insurance companies, with the oil companies.
[02:18:52.802 --> 02:18:54.663]  All in this together.
[02:18:54.683 --> 02:18:57.824]  Now I don't know if this woman's a useful idiot.
[02:19:00.848 --> 02:19:10.631]  But the point is, a lot of these scientists, the top scientists, all the main top scientists, from Holdren on down, have been caught in the emails, engaged in fraud.
[02:19:11.831 --> 02:19:17.553]  We're gonna come back and finish this clip, and then it goes into, hey, you saw that, now let's talk about tracking your cars.
[02:19:18.193 --> 02:19:19.233]  That'll fix traffic.
[02:19:19.493 --> 02:19:20.593]  Doesn't it sound reasonable?
[02:19:20.753 --> 02:19:22.674]  We're gonna tax you and track everywhere you go!
[02:19:24.192 --> 02:19:25.353]  We're going to run your life.
[02:19:25.633 --> 02:19:29.915]  If you'll just let us micromanage everything you do, we'll make your life wonderful.
[02:19:30.195 --> 02:19:32.577]  We're the government run by big corrupt banks.
[02:19:33.177 --> 02:19:35.438]  Notice all the SWAT teams and cameras around you.
[02:19:35.778 --> 02:19:37.839]  Notice the CPS grabbing everybody's kids.
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:40.241]  Notice everybody dying on your street of cancer.
[02:19:40.661 --> 02:19:41.261]  Isn't it fun?
[02:19:41.341 --> 02:19:42.082]  Take the shots.
[02:19:42.122 --> 02:19:42.942]  They're good for you.
[02:19:44.503 --> 02:19:47.785]  And then they all write these internal white papers about how they want to kill us.
[02:19:49.517 --> 02:19:55.202]  We're gonna finish this clip, then play the winner of the Berlin Film Festival again, that shows humans as a parasite.
[02:19:55.522 --> 02:19:56.964]  This is what they really think of you.
[02:19:57.164 --> 02:19:58.585]  They want you dead or to doornail.
[02:20:00.006 --> 02:20:01.387]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[02:20:01.748 --> 02:20:05.011]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[02:20:05.551 --> 02:20:09.775]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[02:20:10.395 --> 02:20:15.340]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[02:20:16.064 --> 02:20:18.507]  Patriotfood.com.
[02:20:18.527 --> 02:20:22.953]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[02:20:23.634 --> 02:20:28.381]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[02:20:29.384 --> 02:20:35.248]  And survivalistseeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[02:20:35.268 --> 02:20:39.371]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[02:20:39.791 --> 02:20:45.635]  That's over four pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[02:20:46.175 --> 02:20:49.998]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[02:20:50.518 --> 02:20:54.321]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[02:20:54.821 --> 02:20:57.363]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[02:20:58.447 --> 02:21:02.331]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[02:21:02.572 --> 02:21:06.716]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[02:21:06.836 --> 02:21:08.218]  You get less for your money.
[02:21:08.418 --> 02:21:14.265]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[02:21:14.505 --> 02:21:14.785]  I think so.
[02:21:40.674 --> 02:21:43.215]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:43.255 --> 02:21:44.875]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:44.895 --> 02:21:46.256]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:09.463 --> 02:22:12.104]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:12.124 --> 02:22:18.365]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:18.525 --> 02:22:23.546]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:23.707 --> 02:22:33.689]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:33.809 --> 02:22:35.930]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:37.491]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:37.751 --> 02:22:40.033]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:40.213 --> 02:22:42.054]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:42.334 --> 02:22:47.117]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:47.478 --> 02:22:56.603]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:58.499 --> 02:23:06.906]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:23:07.206 --> 02:23:12.311]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[02:23:12.351 --> 02:23:12.891]  and Canada.
[02:23:13.211 --> 02:23:19.737]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:23:20.297 --> 02:23:23.581]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:23:23.701 --> 02:23:25.943]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[02:23:26.143 --> 02:23:32.509]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:36.073]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[02:23:36.273 --> 02:23:40.137]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[02:23:43.300 --> 02:23:46.264]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[02:23:46.464 --> 02:23:48.546]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[02:23:48.667 --> 02:23:52.051]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[02:23:52.331 --> 02:23:53.432]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[02:24:02.350 --> 02:24:06.036]  In Copenhagen, Denmark right now, world government being established.
[02:24:06.076 --> 02:24:07.598]  Your phone call is coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:07.638 --> 02:24:18.273]  I'm going to break down all the giant developments, more leaked documents, and Lord Mocton went and got the latest version of the treaty.
[02:24:18.914 --> 02:24:27.005]  Financial taxes, oil taxes, power taxes, global government authorities over all, air travel, you name it.
[02:24:27.085 --> 02:24:30.609]  I mean, it is just unbelievable criminal power grab.
[02:24:30.809 --> 02:24:34.034]  But back to the Al Gore funded propaganda, here it is.
[02:24:34.534 --> 02:24:44.266]  We have to do the maneuvering, we have to get special flight clearance, and as you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to 2 G's, and the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board.
[02:24:44.687 --> 02:24:48.972]  So as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation.
[02:24:49.493 --> 02:24:52.837]  It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule.
[02:24:54.195 --> 02:24:56.977]  We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule.
[02:24:57.357 --> 02:25:02.941]  And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject.
[02:25:03.342 --> 02:25:07.745]  And out of that field campaign, we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules.
[02:25:08.345 --> 02:25:16.271]  And as the body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others.
[02:25:16.711 --> 02:25:21.415]  And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has 6 to 10 subsections.
[02:25:21.475 --> 02:25:22.996]  You can imagine the scale of the effort.
[02:25:24.057 --> 02:25:34.286]  In each one of those assessments that we write, we always tag on a summary and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience and we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these.
[02:25:35.587 --> 02:25:36.148]  Thank you very much.
[02:25:45.953 --> 02:25:47.874]  Traffic is a global epidemic.
[02:25:48.815 --> 02:25:52.357]  US traffic is creating 45% of the world's air pollution.
[02:25:52.877 --> 02:25:56.159]  In the UK, time wasted in traffic costs 20 billion a year.
[02:25:56.599 --> 02:25:58.801]  Would you pay for cleaner air on a faster commute?
[02:25:59.241 --> 02:26:00.602]  Stockholm put it to a vote.
[02:26:01.022 --> 02:26:01.882]  I voted for it, yes.
[02:26:02.082 --> 02:26:03.703]  I voted for it.
[02:26:04.224 --> 02:26:04.844]  I vote for it.
[02:26:05.044 --> 02:26:06.285]  We're not old enough to vote.
[02:26:06.585 --> 02:26:06.905]  Vote!
[02:26:09.315 --> 02:26:17.259]  We had to do something in Stockholm to improve the environment and to get a better flow in the traffic.
[02:26:17.539 --> 02:26:24.283]  We put a price on taking your car into the central parts of Stockholm and we call that congestion charges.
[02:26:24.303 --> 02:26:30.926]  If you start a system like this and it doesn't work on the first day, then you will be in big trouble.
[02:26:31.567 --> 02:26:33.608]  It must be perfect from day one.
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:37.061]  There are 18 entry gates to the city.
[02:26:37.481 --> 02:26:38.882]  Each is equipped with cameras.
[02:26:39.342 --> 02:26:42.144]  Pictures are taken of the rear and front license plates.
[02:26:42.604 --> 02:26:50.349]  These pictures are sent to a central system that identifies the license plates and makes sure that the right person pays for the right passages.
[02:26:50.931 --> 02:26:56.755]  One of the obstacles we overcame was the OCR, the optical character reading of the license plate.
[02:26:57.075 --> 02:27:06.281]  We went out to IBM's global organization and the R&D centers and found a very good software we could use and we managed to implement it in two months time.
[02:27:06.441 --> 02:27:10.224]  This is the heart of the system where all images and passages are being processed.
[02:27:10.444 --> 02:27:13.826]  Over 99% of all pictures are correctly identified.
[02:27:13.886 --> 02:27:18.169]  So it's nice, this is how it should be all the time.
[02:27:19.485 --> 02:27:22.732]  Behind me you can see the traffic, and the clock is 6pm.
[02:27:23.092 --> 02:27:26.740]  Before we had the congestion charging, the traffic was chewing up at this time of the day.
[02:27:27.735 --> 02:27:35.017]  I think it's a good idea, because I think that we should take care of the environment in the city.
[02:27:35.417 --> 02:27:40.698]  The traffic went down with about 22% and the air pollution was about 14% better.
[02:27:41.498 --> 02:27:50.200]  It's a huge international interest from different parts of the world, from the United States, from Latin America, from China, and it's
[02:27:51.220 --> 02:27:57.862]  It's really a pleasure to tell people not what we are planning to do, but what we actually have done in Stockholm.
[02:27:58.122 --> 02:27:59.002]  I voted for it.
[02:27:59.142 --> 02:27:59.743]  Yes, I did.
[02:28:00.003 --> 02:28:02.804]  Not my husband, so... I did.
[02:28:03.044 --> 02:28:06.945]  I think he is not thinking like me for the future.
[02:28:07.485 --> 02:28:10.026]  I'm thinking for the children and the grandchildren.
[02:28:11.752 --> 02:28:12.972]  Now what does that ad say?
[02:28:13.412 --> 02:28:16.373]  That's brought to you by IBM, the folks that funded the Nazis.
[02:28:16.413 --> 02:28:20.074]  The numbers on people's arms were to be put in IBM machines.
[02:28:20.394 --> 02:28:21.454]  It's a eugenics company.
[02:28:23.274 --> 02:28:24.494]  Oh, her husband's bad.
[02:28:24.554 --> 02:28:25.935]  He doesn't care about the children.
[02:28:26.135 --> 02:28:29.015]  And of course, they've done congestion charges in London and other places.
[02:28:29.555 --> 02:28:30.655]  Those numbers are frauds.
[02:28:30.695 --> 02:28:31.756]  It does almost nothing.
[02:28:32.936 --> 02:28:36.096]  Some people don't drive anymore because they can't afford the 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20 pounds
[02:28:39.736 --> 02:28:44.642]  Several dollars when you convert it per mile when you drive at peak times.
[02:28:45.002 --> 02:28:45.763]  Now in the U.S.
[02:28:45.783 --> 02:28:47.304]  they have trouble passing this.
[02:28:47.985 --> 02:28:57.235]  So with the NAFTA superhighways right outside Austin, in fact I'm intending to take a camera crew out there, no one takes the toll road where you gotta put the money in.
[02:28:57.335 --> 02:28:58.437]  You don't see anybody exiting.
[02:28:59.375 --> 02:29:01.936]  It just license plate scans you and sends you a bill.
[02:29:02.477 --> 02:29:04.238]  This is going to go on all the highways.
[02:29:04.538 --> 02:29:08.540]  All the major roads are to be turned into toll roads.
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:16.224]  8,000 miles of Texas roads, that came out in the state of Texas to be paid to the private company, Centra of Spain.
[02:29:18.157 --> 02:29:19.757]  This is complete fraud.
[02:29:19.817 --> 02:29:21.098]  This is mass raping.
[02:29:21.138 --> 02:29:22.898]  They build our society around cars.
[02:29:23.578 --> 02:29:25.318]  We live in a sprawling society.
[02:29:25.738 --> 02:29:26.819]  It's designed for that.
[02:29:27.159 --> 02:29:30.019]  The banks bankrupt the society to get us under their control.
[02:29:30.419 --> 02:29:40.301]  Then they throw a wet blanket on what's left of our economy with this taxing grid, and now Obama's proposing it, but with tracker boxes in your cars, not just license plate scanners.
[02:29:40.841 --> 02:29:45.562]  This is the takeover, and IBM, the beast company, is the main group behind it.
[02:29:49.463 --> 02:29:52.453]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.396 --> 02:29:56.084]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.124 --> 02:30:01.746]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:02.146 --> 02:30:07.089]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:07.470 --> 02:30:09.211]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:09.511 --> 02:30:14.334]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:14.515 --> 02:30:15.475]  How much do you want?
[02:30:15.695 --> 02:30:16.456]  When do you want it?
[02:30:16.836 --> 02:30:18.437]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:18.717 --> 02:30:19.538]  When will you need it?
[02:30:19.798 --> 02:30:21.840]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:21.980 --> 02:30:23.100]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:23.321 --> 02:30:24.682]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:24.862 --> 02:30:25.222]  If there's a
[02:30:25.282 --> 02:30:27.225]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[02:30:27.385 --> 02:30:29.908]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:30.109 --> 02:30:33.313]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:33.694 --> 02:30:37.199]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:37.519 --> 02:30:38.520]  How much will you need?
[02:30:38.761 --> 02:30:39.362]  We don't know.
[02:30:39.642 --> 02:30:40.563]  How much do you want?
[02:30:40.764 --> 02:30:41.485]  All you can get.
[02:30:41.505 --> 02:30:42.386]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:42.867 --> 02:30:43.488]  We're good to go.
[02:30:58.149 --> 02:31:02.132]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:31:02.252 --> 02:31:04.994]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:31:05.134 --> 02:31:06.375]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:31:06.395 --> 02:31:07.075]  It's very real.
[02:31:07.215 --> 02:31:09.357]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:31:09.457 --> 02:31:10.998]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:31:11.118 --> 02:31:15.441]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:31:45.938 --> 02:31:47.620]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:31:58.899 --> 02:32:04.082]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.
[02:32:04.483 --> 02:32:18.932]  If you suffer from chronic or recurring pain, or if you take prescription drugs for pain, then you owe it to yourself to visit TPR20info.com and get TPR20, the effective pain relief cream, without the harmful side effects of prescription drugs.
[02:32:19.332 --> 02:32:22.976]  I use TPR-20 for arthritis in my hand and it works great.
[02:32:23.416 --> 02:32:27.520]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.
[02:32:27.921 --> 02:32:37.090]  On TPR20info.com, you can read about the many uses of TPR-20, like arthritis, fibromyalgia, sports injuries, back pain, sore muscles, and much, much more.
[02:32:37.310 --> 02:32:38.411]  Monday through Friday,
[02:33:03.905 --> 02:33:04.606]  From 11 a.m.
[02:33:04.626 --> 02:33:05.206]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:05.266 --> 02:33:08.229]  Central, we're here live back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:08.569 --> 02:33:11.872]  with the Sunday abbreviated transmission against tyranny.
[02:33:12.473 --> 02:33:15.035]  You have found it, the front lines against the New World Order.
[02:33:15.876 --> 02:33:23.642]  I am just reeling from the information breaking today with internal memorandum of the private banks to take full control of the world government.
[02:33:24.003 --> 02:33:27.506]  We already knew they were going to be making the money off of it and administrating a lot of it.
[02:33:27.886 --> 02:33:29.788]  This is administrating the entire system.
[02:33:30.208 --> 02:33:31.248]  This is in the London Guardian.
[02:33:31.268 --> 02:33:35.789]  We're going to be covering that after I talk to Solomon, PJ, Mark, Jim, Kathy, and others.
[02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:38.450]  But I want to explain something.
[02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:44.452]  Two miles from where I sit is a toll road, and when you go on it, it's license plate readers.
[02:33:46.052 --> 02:33:50.813]  And they are putting these in nationwide for a national driving tax for carbon.
[02:33:51.413 --> 02:33:53.714]  They don't care if you don't want it.
[02:33:54.014 --> 02:33:54.794]  They're doing it.
[02:33:54.874 --> 02:33:57.535]  We better take our governments back!
[02:34:01.391 --> 02:34:05.234]  You know, the Google CEO says, yeah, we're surveilling everything you do and giving it to the government.
[02:34:05.574 --> 02:34:06.135]  So what?
[02:34:06.875 --> 02:34:09.117]  And we're going to do it to you on the streets of America.
[02:34:09.718 --> 02:34:11.379]  We're going to track everything you do.
[02:34:11.599 --> 02:34:13.261]  We're going to control everything you do.
[02:34:13.481 --> 02:34:16.523]  We're going to shut your resources off until you're bankrupt.
[02:34:16.903 --> 02:34:20.827]  So you got to come with your hat in your hand for government health care and everything else.
[02:34:22.348 --> 02:34:24.449]  These people are so diabolical.
[02:34:24.990 --> 02:34:27.672]  How do I get the stupid public to wake up?
[02:34:28.233 --> 02:34:29.794]  Because this is going to be done incrementally.
[02:34:31.488 --> 02:34:32.569]  Like the frog in the pot.
[02:34:33.029 --> 02:34:33.909]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:37.792]  Please make your point quickly because I want to get to the next person, get everybody involved on air.
[02:34:39.773 --> 02:34:42.454]  We've got to start getting a healthy mistrust of the government.
[02:34:42.694 --> 02:34:50.319]  We better cut it down to size because it works for a bunch of corporations that can come in and put 50 cents in the vending machine and get a million dollars back.
[02:34:50.359 --> 02:34:52.060]  That's basically what they get for lobbying.
[02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:58.623]  On average, they get millions of dollars in state and federal international lobbying for every dollar they put in.
[02:35:00.771 --> 02:35:01.372]  It's simple.
[02:35:02.292 --> 02:35:05.054]  It's a giant raping of society.
[02:35:05.895 --> 02:35:09.458]  And the stuff that Monkton dropped on us in the last hour, it was off the charts.
[02:35:09.818 --> 02:35:12.460]  Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo.
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:22.148]  I need you guys to break down that hour-long interview, hour plus, and just get it out in headlines so people will then go watch the video and listen to the audio.
[02:35:25.791 --> 02:35:27.712]  And I'm burning with passion to do more.
[02:35:28.032 --> 02:35:28.373]  I've got...
[02:35:29.218 --> 02:35:31.019]  More international TV to do today.
[02:35:31.699 --> 02:35:34.120]  I've got Texas Monthly here doing an interview.
[02:35:35.761 --> 02:35:43.265]  And all I want to do is go do YouTube videos rallying the people because when I do special videos they get so much more attention than just when I do the show for some reason.
[02:35:44.885 --> 02:35:46.026]  I just want to warn people.
[02:35:46.706 --> 02:35:52.089]  I had a reporter here yesterday with the National Publication asking me, why do you care?
[02:35:52.169 --> 02:35:53.009]  Why are you doing this?
[02:35:53.049 --> 02:35:54.190]  Why do you think I'm doing it?
[02:35:54.330 --> 02:35:54.930]  Justice!
[02:35:55.430 --> 02:35:56.631]  I don't want to be a slave!
[02:35:58.012 --> 02:35:59.934]  And they're like, but you believe there's a world government?
[02:35:59.954 --> 02:36:01.015]  What do you mean I believe it?
[02:36:01.035 --> 02:36:02.196]  It's all over the news!
[02:36:07.341 --> 02:36:09.683]  Don't people understand what's happening?
[02:36:11.124 --> 02:36:12.025]  I can hardly continue.
[02:36:12.065 --> 02:36:12.726]  I'm so upset.
[02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:18.031]  I can't take breaks.
[02:36:18.151 --> 02:36:18.931]  I can't stop.
[02:36:18.951 --> 02:36:22.395]  I wake up at four in the morning this morning worried about this.
[02:36:23.697 --> 02:36:26.638]  My wife gets up at 6, I'm wandering around the living room, she's like, what are you doing?
[02:36:26.698 --> 02:36:28.918]  I'm in there reading leaked treaties.
[02:36:29.298 --> 02:36:30.498]  I just, I can't.
[02:36:31.899 --> 02:36:34.339]  I just wish people cared about freedom instead of football.
[02:36:34.719 --> 02:36:37.660]  I wish they cared about their Bill of Rights, their Constitution.
[02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:43.101]  I wish they would research what we know and find out we're telling you the truth!
[02:36:45.221 --> 02:36:47.982]  You heard Lord Monthan, it's worse than we can even describe!
[02:36:56.345 --> 02:36:56.825]  You heard him.
[02:36:57.005 --> 02:36:59.907]  World government is being established.
[02:36:59.947 --> 02:37:00.688]  Tyrannical.
[02:37:00.868 --> 02:37:01.448]  Unelected.
[02:37:01.528 --> 02:37:02.229]  Controlling.
[02:37:02.629 --> 02:37:03.209]  Eugenics.
[02:37:03.610 --> 02:37:07.452]  World government is being openly established right now.
[02:37:09.273 --> 02:37:13.856]  They're putting up the license plate reading cameras for taxation all over the country.
[02:37:13.956 --> 02:37:19.060]  Obama has announced next year they're going to try to pass a law to start taxing you.
[02:37:20.919 --> 02:37:25.201]  And the cops, and the checkpoints, and the tickets, and when you can't pay for insurance, they arrest you.
[02:37:25.661 --> 02:37:27.842]  And the illegals are left alone or above the law.
[02:37:29.842 --> 02:37:32.163]  It's all designed to bankrupt you.
[02:37:32.243 --> 02:37:34.304]  I've read you what Ban Ki-moon said.
[02:37:34.344 --> 02:37:37.365]  I've read to you what Maury Strong and David Rockefeller said.
[02:37:37.625 --> 02:37:41.047]  They want to destroy our society.
[02:37:41.327 --> 02:37:42.147]  Period!
[02:37:42.948 --> 02:37:46.489]  What is it about that some of you people out there can't understand?
[02:38:01.647 --> 02:38:07.169]  You know, Aaron Dykes wrote an article last night, when I got up at 4 in the morning, I saw he just posted it, so he was here at 4 in the morning.
[02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:24.295]  I don't tell him to be here until 4 in the morning, he gets here at about noon and stays until 4 in the morning, he can't leave because he knows all this stuff, about the federal informant that set up the people trying to get him to throw them all off cocktails, turns out they never did it, weren't planning it, they got 6 years in prison apiece.
[02:38:25.390 --> 02:38:37.279]  Turns out he admits he's a federal informant and it's being reported by eyewitnesses in Austin that he tried to get them to firebomb Brave New Books that sells my films and books and has events.
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:44.444]  Where tomorrow or two days from now, that's what these witnesses are saying.
[02:38:44.665 --> 02:38:46.946]  He admits he tried to set people up to do firebombs.
[02:38:47.947 --> 02:38:50.329]  I happen to know from internal police sources
[02:38:53.462 --> 02:39:04.931]  I heard this when the firebombing of the mansion happened from sources and couldn't go on air with it, that it was connected to the feds locally trying to set up Brave New Books and myself.
[02:39:05.071 --> 02:39:07.073]  And now the evidence is coming out.
[02:39:07.113 --> 02:39:09.255]  I mean, folks, I got feds on my tail.
[02:39:09.835 --> 02:39:12.898]  The Pentagon follows me around and it's admitted in the newspaper.
[02:39:13.478 --> 02:39:16.320]  You understand we're fighting for America and freedom?
[02:39:16.701 --> 02:39:18.562]  You understand how real this is?
[02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:20.724]  And I'm so focused on
[02:39:27.947 --> 02:39:31.930]  You know, over the mansion thing, and I never talked about this on air, we had the BATF show up here.
[02:39:32.610 --> 02:39:33.871]  When the mansion got firebombed.
[02:39:35.432 --> 02:39:43.998]  And then we had these informant types coming around, trying to give us information about it, and it's just a total operation.
[02:39:44.078 --> 02:39:46.919]  I mean, I am blessed that I'm not even in prison right now.
[02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:49.241]  Thank God I keep my operations small.
[02:39:49.641 --> 02:39:51.342]  Thank God I watch my butt.
[02:39:51.402 --> 02:39:53.764]  Thank God I don't commit any crimes.
[02:39:55.085 --> 02:39:56.226]  That's a whole other subject.
[02:39:56.306 --> 02:39:56.666]  It's just...
[02:40:03.991 --> 02:40:06.033]  These people are so evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:08.175 --> 02:40:09.016]  They are so evil.
[02:40:11.199 --> 02:40:11.959]  They are so bad.
[02:40:19.647 --> 02:40:19.788]  And...
[02:40:22.836 --> 02:40:24.778]  I just don't even, I mean it's insane.
[02:40:25.078 --> 02:40:36.970]  We live in Nazi Germany in 1937 and it's just getting worse and worse and worse and the same globalists that funded Hitler, Mao, Stalin on record are now planting a mass coal here in America.
[02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:40.693]  And they brainwashed the cops, they're trying to brainwash the military.
[02:40:41.154 --> 02:40:43.256]  It is just so horrible.
[02:40:58.379 --> 02:41:06.646]  I can't tell you how many times I go to a book signing or a video showing or a speech and these cops walk up in plain clothes and say, Alex, let's go blow stuff up.
[02:41:08.588 --> 02:41:10.290]  And of course I say, no, I'm nonviolent.
[02:41:10.350 --> 02:41:12.031]  In fact, I'm going to call the police on you right now.
[02:41:12.051 --> 02:41:14.734]  And then they run off with their unmarked police cars outside.
[02:41:18.609 --> 02:41:19.390]  But they don't care.
[02:41:19.730 --> 02:41:26.135]  If they're able to ever get into my operation, they will just make it up that we're doing something.
[02:41:26.655 --> 02:41:29.718]  These people are pure evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:29.998 --> 02:41:31.900]  They think of their fellow humans as animals.
[02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:33.981]  They think setting people up is a joke.
[02:41:34.262 --> 02:41:34.982]  They think it's funny.
[02:41:35.002 --> 02:41:35.943]  Look at Tommy Chong.
[02:41:36.684 --> 02:41:40.286]  That's a random video generator of images from InfoWars.com.
[02:41:42.435 --> 02:41:43.876]  That's fake that that just came up.
[02:41:43.956 --> 02:41:46.699]  I was just thinking about Tommy Chong two minutes ago.
[02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:52.344]  Tommy Chong's sons sold pipes that, yeah, you could smoke marijuana with.
[02:41:53.485 --> 02:42:02.194]  And for five years, in one county out of Pennsylvania where it's illegal to sell pipes, they got hundreds of orders for the pipes.
[02:42:03.916 --> 02:42:06.878]  Because it's illegal to ship there, and they always said no.
[02:42:07.219 --> 02:42:20.589]  So the feds got an informant, took them years, hired at the pipe factory to go in and illegally ship it to the town so they could go arrest Tommy Chong.
[02:42:21.330 --> 02:42:24.332]  That's the type of people we are dealing with.
[02:42:24.873 --> 02:42:27.475]  And the federal court said, yeah, the U.S.
[02:42:27.495 --> 02:42:31.218]  attorney said it doesn't matter if we've sent somebody in there to ship it out.
[02:42:31.398 --> 02:42:33.380]  Still a crime, but the company let that happen.
[02:42:34.625 --> 02:42:37.367]  That's how criminal this government is.
[02:42:37.827 --> 02:42:40.689]  That's how evil these people are.
[02:42:40.769 --> 02:42:41.650]  And you know what?
[02:42:44.231 --> 02:42:45.973]  I don't even know what to say anymore about this.
[02:42:46.293 --> 02:42:51.536]  It's just... I don't want my children to be slaves.
[02:42:51.717 --> 02:42:52.457]  I want to be free.
[02:42:52.597 --> 02:42:53.438]  I want you to be free.
[02:42:53.478 --> 02:42:54.138]  And so I'm bad.
[02:42:56.780 --> 02:42:57.440]  It's that simple.
[02:42:59.562 --> 02:43:02.144]  And I have the New World Order just circling me like sharks.
[02:43:03.015 --> 02:43:04.075]  And I just trust in God.
[02:43:04.096 --> 02:43:06.036]  So we can just keep getting the message out.
[02:43:06.076 --> 02:43:06.897]  Keep getting the message out.
[02:43:06.917 --> 02:43:08.738]  And God knows how they're going to try to set me up.
[02:43:08.778 --> 02:43:09.998]  They've tried so many other things.
[02:43:10.699 --> 02:43:12.099]  God knows, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:18.042 --> 02:43:19.503]  God knows what's going to happen to us.
[02:43:26.226 --> 02:43:30.908]  But, they've got terrorist units right here in the town I live in.
[02:43:32.602 --> 02:43:34.443]  They're terrorists, they're not anti-terror units.
[02:43:36.404 --> 02:43:49.090]  I caught police in Fortune 500 in 1999, when the Fortune 500 came to Austin, dressed up like anarchists, attacking people, starting fights, and then I had the anarchist leaders come over and threaten me, and I said, you work for the feds, don't you?
[02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.730]  And they said, yeah.
[02:43:50.050 --> 02:43:52.191]  And when we take over, we're gonna kill you, Jones.
[02:43:52.651 --> 02:43:56.333]  That wasn't the cops, that was the foundation people, working with them.
[02:43:59.892 --> 02:44:10.638]  And they pointed up to the men with binoculars up on top of the building, and this one anarchist got up in my face and started bumping into me and goes, that's right, I work for those guys up there, and we're watching you, buddy.
[02:44:11.258 --> 02:44:11.959]  And they love it.
[02:44:11.999 --> 02:44:13.159]  They hate this country.
[02:44:13.479 --> 02:44:14.980]  They want to bring this country down.
[02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:16.961]  They love the power of working for the government.
[02:44:17.222 --> 02:44:19.143]  They love the fact they can commit crimes.
[02:44:19.483 --> 02:44:21.344]  They love the fact that they do all this.
[02:44:32.662 --> 02:44:34.004]  Alright, I said I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:44:34.064 --> 02:44:38.089]  It just gives me a gigantic headache to be in the middle of this.
[02:44:38.169 --> 02:44:41.614]  But at the same time, it's a good thing we're fighting the tyranny.
[02:44:41.674 --> 02:44:44.257]  It's a good thing we're standing up to all of this evil.
[02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:46.901]  It's a good thing.
[02:44:48.220 --> 02:44:49.661]  That we're resisting the New World Order.
[02:44:50.341 --> 02:44:53.143]  And we're doing the right thing, and we're not backing down, we're telling the truth.
[02:44:53.664 --> 02:44:59.247]  And we're the good guys, and we're the people that are pure and honest, and pure of heart, and are honest.
[02:44:59.928 --> 02:45:04.531]  And the people are waking up to this tyranny, and I just want to bring this tyranny to justice.
[02:45:04.691 --> 02:45:13.137]  I want to get our country back on the right track, and not let these criminals in government and corporate America that think they own this country rape the living daylights out of everybody.
[02:45:14.177 --> 02:45:16.179]  I want to thank a few sponsors, and I am going to your calls.
[02:45:23.072 --> 02:45:24.373]  SurvivalSeedBank.com
[02:45:44.705 --> 02:45:45.906]  Governments are storing seeds.
[02:45:45.926 --> 02:45:46.266]  The U.N.
[02:45:46.306 --> 02:45:47.086]  is storing seeds.
[02:45:47.426 --> 02:45:49.807]  Globalists of every stripe are storing seeds of the Arctic Circle.
[02:45:50.187 --> 02:45:51.128]  Why do you think this is?
[02:45:51.188 --> 02:45:51.628]  You know why.
[02:45:51.688 --> 02:45:52.448]  Control and power.
[02:45:52.828 --> 02:45:56.210]  Solutions from science is trying to get the seeds out of the globalist hands, into the hands of the people.
[02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:58.130]  One seed bank at a time, one family at a time.
[02:45:58.150 --> 02:45:59.731]  Survival Seed Bank from Solutions from Science.
[02:46:00.071 --> 02:46:00.491]  Thanks enough.
[02:46:00.591 --> 02:46:02.012]  Open pollinated seeds to plant a full...
[02:46:03.151 --> 02:46:03.371]  Thank you.
[02:46:23.476 --> 02:46:24.918]  Tell you about Silver Lungs.
[02:46:25.399 --> 02:46:26.760]  Silverlungs.com.

[02:46:47.441 --> 02:46:53.622]  Go to SilverLungs.com and be sure to check out their complete line of colloidal silver generators and the very affordable, ready-made ionic silver solutions.
[02:46:54.022 --> 02:46:55.863]  Or check out their banner on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:46:55.883 --> 02:46:57.903]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[02:46:58.303 --> 02:47:00.404]  SilverLungs.com.
[02:47:04.502 --> 02:47:21.233]  What I ought to do is in the last 20 minutes of the show have Aaron Dykes because he's the one doing the deep research on this and I already knew it was an operation and knew that we had people showing up at the office trying to talk to us about the mansion fire.
[02:47:22.922 --> 02:47:27.684]  And then I had a police source that warned me that it was an intelligence operation.
[02:47:28.465 --> 02:47:35.608]  It was probably an inside job by the government to get rid of the DPS director and have a police state crackdown further in the state of Texas.
[02:47:35.628 --> 02:47:37.529]  It wouldn't go under Homeland Security control.
[02:47:39.670 --> 02:47:51.977]  And then it turns out the FBI informant, who I was told was an informant at the time, I didn't really know who they were, I was just told about it from sources, who did set up the two people from Austin up in
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:55.346]  Up in Minneapolis-St.
[02:47:55.366 --> 02:47:56.814]  Paul for the RMC last year.
[02:47:58.854 --> 02:48:02.176]  And it's admitted, he's done NPR interviews, that the people never were gonna firebomb.
[02:48:02.197 --> 02:48:04.578]  He kept telling them, we gotta firebomb, we gotta be real activists.
[02:48:05.099 --> 02:48:08.561]  And then the kids never showed up to do the firebombing, but they still arrested him.
[02:48:08.841 --> 02:48:24.133]  So basically, this guy just sat around talking about it, and now eyewitnesses in Austin are saying, yeah, no, this guy was having meetings with a Palestinian guy that got murdered and thrown in the lake, all gutted and tortured, and then they said it was a suicide, with his arms bound in the water.
[02:48:24.153 --> 02:48:25.574]  That's like...
[02:48:27.779 --> 02:48:37.784]  Gary Webb, who wrote the CIA crack cocaine story, shooting himself twice in the head, and witnesses seeing, you know, men climbing in and out of his house, and the media said, oh yeah, it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head.
[02:48:38.524 --> 02:48:48.409]  Turns out that guy is an admitted federal informant, and eyewitnesses are saying, and there needs to be a criminal investigation of this, that he wanted them to firebomb Brave New Books.
[02:48:51.667 --> 02:48:57.889]  What they wanted to do was get the patsies in there to then claim Brave New Books was involved, if that's true and it fits in.
[02:48:58.969 --> 02:49:10.532]  And, uh... I knew it was a setup at the time when I started getting all this chatter and people wanting to come over to the office, and I was, no, no, no.
[02:49:10.552 --> 02:49:17.174]  That's why we don't let anybody at the office, and our location is hidden, and no one is ever to come here, and no one is, you know, due to not answer the door.
[02:49:18.952 --> 02:49:21.373]  Uh, because we've had people try to set us up with other stuff.
[02:49:21.413 --> 02:49:22.653]  I mean, it's dangerous, folks.
[02:49:22.673 --> 02:49:24.714]  These informants are just very sinister.
[02:49:25.855 --> 02:49:27.895]  And, uh, because they're not informants, they're operatives.
[02:49:28.456 --> 02:49:30.416]  These are intelligence operations being run.
[02:49:31.477 --> 02:49:40.140]  And so... I called the state police about this, and they sent the BATF out.
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:44.962]  Because I said, I know these people are here, and I believe this is an inside job.
[02:49:48.083 --> 02:49:52.287]  And I wanted it on record that I wasn't anywhere near any of their people.
[02:49:54.729 --> 02:50:01.255]  So the whole thing in Minnesota, the whole thing with the governor's mansion, all of this interconnected, guaranteed.
[02:50:02.156 --> 02:50:12.506]  And I don't know if this particular informant, as is being reported with the Brave New Books or with this Palestinian that was killed, but these are a lot of witnesses that people
[02:50:13.599 --> 02:50:16.523]  No at Brave New Books, and I trust their reports.
[02:50:17.784 --> 02:50:22.610]  But again, the establishment doesn't want a little bookstore educating the public down on Guadalupe Street.
[02:50:23.972 --> 02:50:29.899]  And these eyewitnesses say this federal informant begged them to firebomb Brave New Books.
[02:50:33.228 --> 02:50:36.650]  And so this is the type of just craziness that we're living in the middle of.
[02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:39.632]  And then I go to end the Fed rallies and it later gets declassified.
[02:50:39.672 --> 02:50:40.993]  The army is there watching us.
[02:50:41.874 --> 02:50:46.777]  They want to radicalize everything politically to demonize anyone that is outspoken.
[02:50:47.977 --> 02:50:52.360]  And that's why I've always said we are non-violent here and do not call for violence.
[02:50:54.461 --> 02:50:57.543]  Because the system wants to set us up.
[02:50:59.096 --> 02:51:00.737]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[02:51:00.857 --> 02:51:02.298]  Say no to toxic overload.
[02:51:02.358 --> 02:51:03.459]  Say no to chemicals.
[02:51:03.699 --> 02:51:05.500]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[02:51:05.641 --> 02:51:14.386]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[02:51:14.446 --> 02:51:19.690]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[02:51:19.850 --> 02:51:21.472]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[02:51:21.653 --> 02:51:29.063]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[02:52:07.509 --> 02:52:08.932]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:09.814 --> 02:52:12.276]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.

[02:52:24.247 --> 02:52:33.876]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:33.976 --> 02:52:36.098]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:36.338 --> 02:52:37.659]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:37.919 --> 02:52:40.181]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:40.381 --> 02:52:42.222]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:42.502 --> 02:52:47.306]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:14.002 --> 02:54:21.387]  Okay, at the end of the show, I'm going to have Aaron in with his article at InfoWars.com to break this down, but Aaron just corrected me.
[02:54:21.427 --> 02:54:34.695]  On the NPR piece, they admit this federal informant who set up the guys who do never carry it out, a firebombing with Molotov cocktails, and the reports are he was telling them, let's do it, let's do it, let's stand up to these people.
[02:54:35.456 --> 02:54:38.498]  He comes out of New Orleans, just like Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:54:38.538 --> 02:54:40.078]  He's in Texas, in Austin.
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:50.131]  Uh, he then is involved in Brave New Books, he's involved with these different organizations, and the Palestinian guy that got brutally murdered and they said was a suicide, you corrected me.
[02:54:50.191 --> 02:54:55.978]  On the NPR piece, they admit he had infiltrated, uh, that, uh, he was a professor.
[02:54:56.979 --> 02:55:01.001]  So, I mean, I'm going from memory on all this because this happened a year ago, but Aaron?
[02:55:01.261 --> 02:55:13.486]  Yeah, it's a little convoluted, but in the NPR story, they make it sound nice and friendly, and they claim that this Riyad Hamad and his associates somehow were the terrorists, and what that may or may not be based on, I have no idea.
[02:55:13.506 --> 02:55:19.909]  And they claim that he was the informant trying to bust that up, and that they were trying to recruit this FBI informant.
[02:55:19.929 --> 02:55:21.130]  It was probably backwards.
[02:55:21.630 --> 02:55:28.438]  Yeah, but why would this FBI informant, because there's other eyewitnesses stepping forward, why would he be trying to get locals to firebomb Brave New Books?
[02:55:28.798 --> 02:55:37.247]  It's bizarre, and the NPR piece makes no mention of the fact that this Riyadh Hamad was found gagged in duct tape at the bottom of the lake here in Austin.
[02:55:37.347 --> 02:55:38.549]  They called it a suicide.
[02:55:38.849 --> 02:55:43.891]  And separately, this anarchist witness, Scott Crowe, was... You know, I talked to his mosque.
[02:55:43.931 --> 02:55:44.471]  They called me.
[02:55:44.691 --> 02:55:47.633]  They said he was gutted open, sliced open, tortured.
[02:55:47.773 --> 02:55:52.054]  All his friends and associates believe he was murdered, which seems... I mean, that he had been tortured.
[02:55:52.074 --> 02:55:53.415]  He'd been cut up like a hog.
[02:55:53.455 --> 02:56:00.518]  But separately, the anarchist was introduced by this admitted FBI informant, and he was told, these are real revolutionaries.
[02:56:00.598 --> 02:56:05.880]  Riyad Hamad and his associates are really going to get things done, unlike the liberal anarchists.
[02:56:06.360 --> 02:56:10.905]  So he was trying to provocateur, obviously, multiple groups.
[02:56:10.965 --> 02:56:17.012]  Folks, anybody that walks up to you at events and says, let's really blow some stuff up, they're a fan.
[02:56:17.413 --> 02:56:20.877]  And you should pull out a camera, go to their car, put it on YouTube.
[02:56:21.397 --> 02:56:21.537]  Yep.
[02:56:40.220 --> 02:56:42.141]  Then I got a police source going, yeah, no, no, no.
[02:56:42.281 --> 02:56:45.943]  There's informants involved with all of this and fire bombings planned in Austin.
[02:56:46.323 --> 02:56:47.764]  And they're planning to set you up.
[02:56:48.024 --> 02:56:49.765]  And that's why I went and called the police.
[02:56:49.845 --> 02:56:50.345]  I said, uh-uh.
[02:56:50.365 --> 02:56:51.305]  That's insane.
[02:56:51.385 --> 02:56:52.486]  Not doing that to me.
[02:56:52.506 --> 02:56:53.806]  Remember when the BATF was here?
[02:56:53.826 --> 02:56:54.006]  Oh, yeah.
[02:56:54.327 --> 02:56:55.287]  That's freaky stuff.
[02:56:55.367 --> 02:56:58.208]  I mean, I didn't even talk about that on air because people can't believe this.
[02:56:58.529 --> 02:56:59.789]  Secret Service, FBI.
[02:57:00.009 --> 02:57:01.490]  I mean, it's a routine occurrence here.
[02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:07.492]  Yeah, and love or hate what the anarchists are doing, they said for six years this was the only guy talking violence.
[02:57:07.932 --> 02:57:13.394]  He was always the one trying to provocateur violence, all the way back to whatever they were doing six years ago.
[02:57:13.934 --> 02:57:27.658]  Well let me tell you, this Governor's Mansion thing, and the way that for 15 minutes the ambulances and the fire trucks stood down, and then how they claim they don't have any footage of it, and then I went and talked to eyewitnesses down there,
[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:31.121]  Who saw all sorts of suspicious stuff?
[02:57:31.922 --> 02:57:32.522]  It's bizarre.
[02:57:32.862 --> 02:57:42.648]  And then this stuff happens up at the RNC, and it turns out he was just provocateuring some entry-level anarchists, called them weaklings, and said they couldn't get the job done.
[02:57:43.069 --> 02:57:44.229]  And that's what goaded him on.
[02:57:44.269 --> 02:57:45.170]  Yeah, it's on record.
[02:57:45.210 --> 02:57:46.271]  You're weaklings, you're weaklings.
[02:57:46.291 --> 02:57:47.371]  And finally they said, okay.
[02:57:47.712 --> 02:57:48.012]  Boom.
[02:57:48.052 --> 02:57:49.313]  They had him for the conspiracy.
[02:57:49.493 --> 02:57:52.695]  But they didn't show up that morning when the feds were waiting with the bottle bombs.
[02:57:52.935 --> 02:57:55.677]  Then he provocateured him again and said, are you really going to do this?
[02:57:55.757 --> 02:57:57.198]  And that's what led to it.
[02:57:57.238 --> 02:58:00.400]  He provocateured the whole thing, if you can believe these accounts.
[02:58:01.340 --> 02:58:03.622]  And he's been evidently all over Austin.
[02:58:03.642 --> 02:58:06.764]  You know, I could hardly watch videos of him that you have linked in the article.
[02:58:06.804 --> 02:58:08.185]  He looks so slimy.
[02:58:08.905 --> 02:58:11.267]  So, just, I can't even look at the guy.
[02:58:11.827 --> 02:58:12.047]  Yeah.
[02:58:12.067 --> 02:58:13.548]  I mean, this is a Judas.
[02:58:14.328 --> 02:58:17.430]  And he was all over New Orleans with the hurricane relief effort.
[02:58:17.731 --> 02:58:21.253]  He was just infiltrating all these groups throughout Texas and Louisiana.
[02:58:22.755 --> 02:58:29.683]  And there's claims he was down in Venezuela meeting with FARC rebel leaders who wanted to set up a hot war guerrilla fight.
[02:58:29.703 --> 02:58:32.105]  Oh yeah, this guy's got CIA written all over him, doesn't he?
[02:58:32.486 --> 02:58:33.206]  Oh, it's insane.
[02:58:33.226 --> 02:58:34.448]  But he's the type they'll burn.
[02:58:34.748 --> 02:58:36.089]  Don't worry, he'll get what he wants.
[02:58:36.109 --> 02:58:43.938]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:44.558 --> 02:58:45.099]  We are...
[02:58:48.402 --> 02:58:53.588]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:58:53.708 --> 02:58:58.073]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:58:58.233 --> 02:59:00.095]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:59:00.516 --> 02:59:01.877]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:59:02.138 --> 02:59:03.179]  There is a solution.
[02:59:03.399 --> 02:59:11.421]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:59:53.809 --> 02:59:56.791]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:02.073 --> 03:00:13.178]  Alright, now I'm going to your calls, Solomon, PJ, Mark, Jim, Kathy, and others.
[03:00:13.198 --> 03:00:15.539]  I'm gonna give you the latest on climate change.
[03:00:15.600 --> 03:00:20.062]  Giant developments there, but... Solomon in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[03:00:20.122 --> 03:00:20.522]  Go ahead.
[03:00:21.653 --> 03:00:22.734]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[03:00:23.494 --> 03:00:27.557]  I just want to say that God is watching over you, man, all the stuff that happens to you.
[03:00:28.918 --> 03:00:30.979]  So I'm just going to get right into my points.
[03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:39.525]  Even though they're passing all this Copenhagen stuff and everything that's going on, I just wanted to say something to the audience.
[03:00:39.585 --> 03:00:44.408]  It's just like, even though these pieces of paper are being signed, compliance is an option.
[03:00:44.508 --> 03:00:46.770]  It's whether or not we want to stand up.
[03:00:46.810 --> 03:00:48.711]  And this is just making me so sick.
[03:00:49.212 --> 03:00:55.033]  That these people are going around and colluding and Al Gore going around.
[03:00:55.133 --> 03:01:01.675]  I'm sorry, I'm just getting so upset, but people can't fight the New World Order because they fear themselves.
[03:01:01.735 --> 03:01:12.538]  So I think that we're reaching a very spiritual time in our society where we have to go inside of ourselves and gather the strength that we need to fight these people because they have no strength inside themselves.
[03:01:12.938 --> 03:01:13.598]  I mean, look at them.
[03:01:13.638 --> 03:01:14.838]  Look at Rockefeller.
[03:01:14.858 --> 03:01:15.699]  Look at all these people.
[03:01:15.719 --> 03:01:16.459]  Look at Al Gore.
[03:01:16.479 --> 03:01:17.599]  They're just fat.
[03:01:18.154 --> 03:01:22.497]  You know, self-hating people that just want to prove to themselves that they can run the world.
[03:01:22.957 --> 03:01:27.099]  And if you ran up to these people on the streets, they'd be so scared they'd be shaking in their boots.
[03:01:27.139 --> 03:01:30.041]  So, I just really want to go out there.
[03:01:30.061 --> 03:01:31.382]  That is what's sick.
[03:01:31.402 --> 03:01:38.266]  You've got a bunch of inbred, degenerate, murdering control freaks that we just let roll over us because they're the authorities.
[03:01:39.445 --> 03:01:48.947]  Yeah, it's crazy because people look at them as if they have some knowledge that we don't, or some kind of something that we don't.
[03:01:49.047 --> 03:01:51.888]  And I see so many people day after day, they're trying to wake up.
[03:01:51.908 --> 03:01:52.948]  It's just they're scared.
[03:01:53.248 --> 03:01:54.488]  They're scared to be themselves.
[03:01:54.508 --> 03:02:03.830]  They're scared to go out there and tell everybody else what they know or what they feel about the New World Order, about the Copenhagen Agreements, or about climate gay being a fraud.
[03:02:04.390 --> 03:02:05.430]  They're scared of themselves.
[03:02:05.470 --> 03:02:08.491]  So I think that the important message is they're not going to win.
[03:02:09.712 --> 03:02:10.373]  God bless you.
[03:02:11.114 --> 03:02:11.695]  God bless you.
[03:02:11.715 --> 03:02:12.756]  Great points, Solomon.
[03:02:12.796 --> 03:02:13.437]  Thank you for holding.
[03:02:13.758 --> 03:02:15.260]  PJ in the UK, go ahead.
[03:02:16.633 --> 03:02:17.314]  Good evening, Alex.
[03:02:17.354 --> 03:02:19.175]  Thank you very much for your interview at Mountain.
[03:02:19.195 --> 03:02:20.596]  That was first class radio.
[03:02:20.656 --> 03:02:21.417]  Thank you very much indeed.
[03:02:21.677 --> 03:02:22.458]  Three quick points.
[03:02:23.278 --> 03:02:27.241]  Just the BBC are cranking up the global warming programmes today.
[03:02:27.321 --> 03:02:29.783]  Just gone out on the BBC at one o'clock and at six o'clock.
[03:02:30.164 --> 03:02:39.011]  David Shuckman, the Environment spokesman, and Dr Nikki Pope, the head of the Met Office, the weather office, saying the last ten years have been the warmest in history.
[03:02:39.491 --> 03:02:40.833]  Which is admittedly a fraud.
[03:02:41.493 --> 03:02:46.499]  CNN, every channel is wall-to-wall, end of the world, if we don't pass this.
[03:02:47.921 --> 03:02:48.421]  Absolutely.
[03:02:48.802 --> 03:02:52.146]  I'm just making these points quickly, but I just thought you people would pick that up.
[03:02:52.206 --> 03:02:54.889]  I sent you an email on this earlier on.
[03:02:55.276 --> 03:02:59.038]  But the AMPR cameras, we've had those here for two years.
[03:02:59.518 --> 03:03:01.019]  I'll tell you how sophisticated they are now.
[03:03:01.399 --> 03:03:04.201]  Police motorbikes can have them, traffic, police cars have them.
[03:03:04.681 --> 03:03:06.662]  Stationary points on traffic lights can have them.
[03:03:07.122 --> 03:03:14.986]  Along the London congestion charge, if you don't pay the daily £8 or £12 charge, within 24 hours at an electronic pay point, you get the fine in the post £80.
[03:03:16.377 --> 03:03:22.342]  So it'll get to that level of sophistication which is what you said there very emotionally after that hour with Lord Monckton.
[03:03:22.663 --> 03:03:30.670]  Surely the entire patriot radio movement and newspapers and everything should get together for 10 days now and just concentrate on this Copenhagen thing.
[03:03:31.090 --> 03:03:31.651]  That's sure.
[03:03:31.671 --> 03:03:32.792]  I'm just putting up a suggestion.
[03:03:32.892 --> 03:03:34.733]  Yeah, for those that don't know, that's what I'd read.
[03:03:34.793 --> 03:03:41.256]  It was as much as 12 pounds just to come in and out of the city, and then now they're starting to put it nationwide.
[03:03:41.697 --> 03:03:43.478]  Oregon, California are getting ready.
[03:03:43.738 --> 03:03:48.160]  They're getting ready here to turn all the roads into toll roads off license plate readers.
[03:03:48.620 --> 03:03:51.622]  This is so hellish, and it tracks everywhere you go!
[03:03:53.545 --> 03:03:57.127]  The big supermarkets have ANPR capability as well.
[03:03:57.387 --> 03:04:04.912]  In case you drive out and don't pay for petrol, they're connected to the DVS, the National Registration Bureau, and they can pick your address and get you for that.
[03:04:05.032 --> 03:04:07.714]  But here they're not telling the public.
[03:04:08.014 --> 03:04:14.018]  People just, I've been in cars, they go, I wonder how it comes in the mail when you drive under the camera.
[03:04:14.438 --> 03:04:17.280]  It's reading your license plate, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:19.481]  It's a Pentagon control grid.
[03:04:21.092 --> 03:04:21.512]  Yes, sir.
[03:04:21.872 --> 03:04:22.432]  Absolutely.
[03:04:22.972 --> 03:04:24.813]  But one other quick point.
[03:04:24.853 --> 03:04:25.653]  I know it's another program.
[03:04:25.973 --> 03:04:27.013]  You interviewed Nigel Farage.
[03:04:27.033 --> 03:04:28.013]  I worked with Nigel for years.
[03:04:28.093 --> 03:04:30.974]  His short, sharp, very fantastic speeches are on YouTube.
[03:04:31.014 --> 03:04:31.574]  There are 20 of them.
[03:04:31.874 --> 03:04:32.674]  They're well worth hearing.
[03:04:32.994 --> 03:04:33.254]  No, no.
[03:04:33.294 --> 03:04:34.774]  We want Nigel Farage on.
[03:04:34.794 --> 03:04:35.535]  We're trying to get him.
[03:04:35.555 --> 03:04:38.615]  In fact, how's that going with the British member of the European Parliament?
[03:04:39.735 --> 03:04:40.756]  Oh, he's knocking hell out of them.
[03:04:40.776 --> 03:04:42.476]  But I'll send you another email.
[03:04:42.536 --> 03:04:43.796]  There's no picking him up.
[03:04:43.856 --> 03:04:44.556]  He'll come on.
[03:04:45.016 --> 03:04:46.517]  But I'll send you his contact number.
[03:04:46.557 --> 03:04:48.517]  Yeah, he's the head of the... What's the name of the party?
[03:04:49.735 --> 03:04:51.076]  The UK Independence Party.
[03:04:51.316 --> 03:04:53.237]  Yeah, the head of the UK Independence Party.
[03:04:53.517 --> 03:04:53.878]  Stay there.
[03:04:53.898 --> 03:04:55.278]  I want you to finish your point when we get back.
[03:04:58.320 --> 03:05:02.583]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:02.883 --> 03:05:06.946]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:07.206 --> 03:05:12.629]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:12.970 --> 03:05:13.430]  It's true.
[03:05:13.710 --> 03:05:18.253]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:18.573 --> 03:05:19.114]  Number 3.
[03:05:19.394 --> 03:05:22.677]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:22.977 --> 03:05:26.720]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:26.901 --> 03:05:27.441]  Number 4.
[03:05:27.701 --> 03:05:30.063]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:30.464 --> 03:05:33.847]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:34.147 --> 03:05:34.347]  Number 5.
[03:05:34.928 --> 03:05:38.851]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:39.072 --> 03:05:43.836]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:05:44.116 --> 03:05:48.142]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:48.282 --> 03:05:49.864]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:50.084 --> 03:05:52.167]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:05:52.327 --> 03:05:54.670]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:05:58.800 --> 03:06:01.402]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:01.822 --> 03:06:06.785]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:07.145 --> 03:06:08.887]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:09.187 --> 03:06:14.010]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:14.190 --> 03:06:15.151]  How much do you want?
[03:06:15.371 --> 03:06:16.131]  When do you want it?
[03:06:16.512 --> 03:06:18.093]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:18.393 --> 03:06:19.213]  When will you need it?
[03:06:19.453 --> 03:06:21.535]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:21.655 --> 03:06:22.776]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:22.996 --> 03:06:24.357]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:24.537 --> 03:06:24.897]  If there's a
[03:06:24.957 --> 03:06:26.899]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[03:06:27.059 --> 03:06:29.601]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:29.781 --> 03:06:32.984]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:33.364 --> 03:06:36.867]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:37.188 --> 03:06:38.188]  How much will you need?
[03:06:38.429 --> 03:06:39.029]  We don't know.
[03:06:39.329 --> 03:06:40.230]  How much do you want?
[03:06:40.430 --> 03:06:41.151]  All you can get.
[03:06:41.171 --> 03:06:42.172]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:42.432 --> 03:06:45.195]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:45.496 --> 03:06:47.238]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:47.258 --> 03:06:48.199]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:57.734 --> 03:07:02.901]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:07:03.041 --> 03:07:04.984]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[03:07:05.124 --> 03:07:07.407]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:07:07.567 --> 03:07:09.430]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:07:09.850 --> 03:07:11.212]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:07:11.472 --> 03:07:12.494]  There is a solution.
[03:07:12.734 --> 03:07:20.738]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:07:21.159 --> 03:07:28.222]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:07:28.603 --> 03:07:34.206]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[03:07:34.646 --> 03:07:40.229]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:07:40.649 --> 03:07:44.470]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[03:07:44.811 --> 03:07:47.672]  Go to E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com.
[03:07:47.992 --> 03:07:49.893]  Or give them a call right now.
[03:07:49.913 --> 03:07:50.533]  866-762-9238.
[03:07:50.673 --> 03:07:55.795]  Click on their banner at InfoWars.com to see all the available discounts.
[03:08:00.236 --> 03:08:06.259]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:06.859 --> 03:08:09.840]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.864 --> 03:08:24.649]  I'm looking at a headline from PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:08:24.789 --> 03:08:36.081]  Youth Corps in action as Explorer scouts take to the streets policing Christmas parade.
[03:08:36.782 --> 03:08:42.328]  Squad stands at attention with lowly green shirts sent to the back of the line.
[03:08:45.237 --> 03:08:52.622]  And remember the New York Times showing that Explorer Scouts were training to take on disgruntled veterans and confiscate their guns?
[03:08:57.826 --> 03:09:00.247]  I tell you, this country is just completely imploding.
[03:09:03.069 --> 03:09:04.290]  Absolutely imploding.
[03:09:06.332 --> 03:09:08.653]  The whole world is just sliding into tyranny right now.
[03:09:08.733 --> 03:09:09.494]  It's just horrible.
[03:09:09.814 --> 03:09:12.296]  PJ, finishing up with the point you wanted to make from the UK.
[03:09:14.264 --> 03:09:16.546]  Just briefly, again, thank you for monitoring that program.
[03:09:16.626 --> 03:09:17.266]  Outstanding work.
[03:09:17.306 --> 03:09:19.308]  I hope you repeat that as your main broadcast this week.
[03:09:19.688 --> 03:09:20.969]  But you mentioned Nigel Farage.
[03:09:21.009 --> 03:09:23.111]  I worked with Nigel Farage for years.
[03:09:23.371 --> 03:09:30.056]  His short, sharp attacks on Blair and Brown, there's about 20 videos on YouTube, are the biggest laceration you'll see
[03:09:30.516 --> 03:09:40.401]  Well we contacted him and maybe it's not getting to the right place.
[03:09:40.441 --> 03:09:45.564]  We'll put you on hold and get, maybe if you have his number or the best way for us to contact him.
[03:09:45.904 --> 03:09:47.365]  I've been wanting to get him on for weeks.
[03:09:47.385 --> 03:09:51.327]  Nigel Farage with the British Independence Party.
[03:09:51.727 --> 03:09:55.049]  Craig, did you have any luck with Nigel Farage?
[03:09:56.529 --> 03:09:57.870]  Did we have any luck getting him on?
[03:09:58.650 --> 03:09:59.791]  Or did he contact us back?
[03:10:04.488 --> 03:10:05.168]  Fantastic.
[03:10:05.269 --> 03:10:07.410]  Okay, well, we'll get that information, PJ.
[03:10:07.450 --> 03:10:07.690]  Thank you.
[03:10:07.710 --> 03:10:08.511]  We'll put you on hold.
[03:10:09.051 --> 03:10:11.353]  Now, definitely somebody fighting the New World Order there.
[03:10:11.793 --> 03:10:12.633]  Mark in Oregon.
[03:10:12.673 --> 03:10:13.494]  Mark, you're on the air.
[03:10:14.355 --> 03:10:14.975]  Morning, Alex.
[03:10:15.555 --> 03:10:15.896]  Hey, buddy.
[03:10:17.677 --> 03:10:29.465]  Alex, you know, I have to second Solomon there, your first caller, I think, as far as God's protecting you, you know, like 24-7.
[03:10:29.965 --> 03:10:32.767]  I know that he is number one because you're
[03:10:33.797 --> 03:10:38.140]  He's one of the foremost truth-tellers on a global level on this planet, and you're very important to him.
[03:10:38.180 --> 03:10:41.241]  He's using you as a tool, and I think you realize that.
[03:10:42.562 --> 03:10:58.892]  And he's going to protect you because you've prayed for yourself, and you have other people praying for you, and because he'll protect you anyway, because he made you to be in the role that you're in, and he's not going to let evil have the upper hand on you, because if God hadn't been protecting you, Alex, you wouldn't even have gotten near this far.
[03:10:59.898 --> 03:11:20.515]  And I know it's hard to see it when these dark birds come circling down close around you and you can see them, but they're doing it just for that reason, to scare you and put fear in you, but they can't do anything to you now for their own reasons, but as I mentioned to you before, it just happens to be the way that God protects you is the whole situation in total, relative to them.
[03:11:20.836 --> 03:11:28.322]  They just, it's not the right time and it never will be the right time, but God will let you know if there's ever a time to flee for your safety.
[03:11:29.205 --> 03:11:32.547]  And you just pray for him to do that for you, and he will do that.
[03:11:32.647 --> 03:11:33.927]  You can take heart in that.
[03:11:34.007 --> 03:11:38.809]  You can live on from the present to the future in this tremendous role that you've done.
[03:11:38.829 --> 03:11:45.152]  Yeah, what the New World Order is trying to do to Alex Jones is lie about me, destroy my name,
[03:11:46.348 --> 03:11:51.511]  From the mainstream media, the alternative media, take what I've said and done out of context.
[03:11:51.991 --> 03:11:57.354]  But it doesn't matter because I'm just getting the info out for the people to stand up and be leaders in their own right.
[03:11:58.014 --> 03:11:59.094]  And so that's what we're doing.
[03:11:59.135 --> 03:12:09.520]  But when I see the Denver police in the Denver Post admitting they dressed up like anarchists and attacked other officers to demonize the peaceful protest,
[03:12:10.660 --> 03:12:35.467]  So they could attack peaceful people, and when I see it in Seattle, and I see it in Genoa, Italy, and I see it at the G20, when they killed a guy just delivering newspapers and then lied about it, and when I see at the SPP meeting last year, police caught dressed up like Anarchists attacking other officers, how do they get the police to be so evil and to carry out false flag attacks
[03:12:36.499 --> 03:12:42.422]  I mean, it's in the Denver Post that police dressed up like anarchists and attacked other police for news cameras.
[03:12:42.863 --> 03:12:48.025]  It's in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that that happened in 99 and they hired anarchists, they brought in.
[03:12:48.446 --> 03:13:01.573]  It was in the major Canadian papers that the police dressed up like anarchists and the people noticed their boots were all the same and that the police staged their arrest and then the Royal Mountain Police had to admit they staged that.
[03:13:02.213 --> 03:13:09.696]  And to just know that they're staging events, provocateuring events, setting people up, lying about it.
[03:13:10.736 --> 03:13:15.518]  I mean, I remember just a few years ago, Texas Monthly.
[03:13:16.400 --> 03:13:27.484]  Who's here, by the way, and the reporter that I interviewed, where an informant went and set up 50-something innocent people just to put them in a private prison and made up that they had drugs.
[03:13:28.204 --> 03:13:33.086]  And in Dallas, the police admittedly just pull you over, throw back a chalk in your car and confiscate it.
[03:13:33.706 --> 03:13:36.988]  And those are just cases that are happening right around me.
[03:13:37.008 --> 03:13:40.069]  I mean, how did they ever get the government so criminal?
[03:13:40.429 --> 03:13:45.972]  How did they ever get so many people to be part of the government and to go out and commit these type of crimes?
[03:13:46.012 --> 03:13:55.497]  I mean, these were like old black people in Tulea, Texas, in many cases with no criminal record, who'd done nothing wrong, and they just put them in the local prison.
[03:13:55.777 --> 03:13:59.539]  They built the prison in Tulea, they had to put somebody in it, so they just set them up.
[03:14:00.459 --> 03:14:08.164]  And, you know, to see the way these informants set up the two young anarchists from Austin to try to firebomb up in Minnesota.
[03:14:08.644 --> 03:14:09.224]  Same deal.
[03:14:09.264 --> 03:14:10.425]  I appreciate your call, Mark.
[03:14:10.765 --> 03:14:12.126]  Let's talk to Jim in New York.
[03:14:12.206 --> 03:14:12.967]  Jim, you're on the air.
[03:14:12.987 --> 03:14:13.387]  Go ahead.
[03:14:13.407 --> 03:14:14.908]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[03:14:15.568 --> 03:14:20.992]  As is my habit, every day I go through Infowars.com to get my news.
[03:14:21.732 --> 03:14:28.656]  And there's an article, I don't know if you've got a chance to look at it, Cap and Trade is Goldman Sachs and Enron scam.
[03:14:30.390 --> 03:14:43.820]  The woman in the YouTube, and I'm sure you'll agree with me, she seems to have part of it right, in my opinion, but then she goes on to say how carbon dioxide is poison, blah blah blah, in the YouTube.
[03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:50.545]  And my fear is that people that are new to the site, that haven't followed this, might, you know, you may want to look at it.
[03:14:50.565 --> 03:14:57.130]  I don't know who posted it, but in any event, they may get the wrong idea, because I know your position.
[03:14:57.330 --> 03:14:58.671]  You know, I went to school.
[03:14:59.635 --> 03:15:04.820]  I learned that Carbon Dioxide, you needed this for plants, and to hope it's all baloney, you know?
[03:15:05.361 --> 03:15:09.124]  Whether it be, you know, this whole thing is just one big scam.
[03:15:09.544 --> 03:15:16.191]  Whether it be health insurance, the industrial military complex in Afghanistan, or this global warming.
[03:15:16.251 --> 03:15:19.333]  They're putting money in their pockets, as you aptly say, you know?
[03:15:19.714 --> 03:15:23.157]  Bunch of gangsters, and they use different pretexts to do it.
[03:15:23.772 --> 03:15:26.434]  But I wouldn't want anybody to be misled.
[03:15:26.474 --> 03:15:28.595]  Yeah, I haven't seen the video we're talking about.
[03:15:28.615 --> 03:15:35.018]  You know, we post hundreds of things a day on InfoWars, on Prison Planet, links to articles, links to videos.
[03:15:35.359 --> 03:15:37.100]  So I haven't seen it and I can't comment.
[03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:39.961]  We post a lot of stuff on there we don't even agree with.
[03:15:39.981 --> 03:15:51.528]  You know, when Ban Ki-moon wrote an editorial for the New York Times, the Secretary General of the UN, three weeks ago, calling for global government and saying that the carbon tax would fund the establishment of world government.
[03:15:52.548 --> 03:15:53.989]  I mean, I link to that article.
[03:15:54.409 --> 03:15:57.650]  It doesn't mean I agree with Ban Ki-moon.
[03:15:57.710 --> 03:15:58.931]  I'm against global government.
[03:15:59.991 --> 03:16:07.914]  At the same time, we link to Herman Von Rompuy, the new head of the EU, saying carbon tax is the key to the world government.
[03:16:08.274 --> 03:16:11.336]  And we don't agree with him, but I haven't seen this video, but I'll check into it.
[03:16:11.676 --> 03:16:12.696]  Anything else, Jim?
[03:16:13.777 --> 03:16:14.677]  Yes, just quickly.
[03:16:15.017 --> 03:16:17.498]  You have things posted by Paul Watson.
[03:16:17.898 --> 03:16:19.419]  When I see that, I know it's good.
[03:16:19.793 --> 03:16:22.335]  You know, that it's not something out of the mainstream, you know?
[03:16:22.835 --> 03:16:24.556]  This thing is, like, so iffy.
[03:16:25.077 --> 03:16:27.658]  You take a look at it, see for yourself, what's your opinion.
[03:16:27.698 --> 03:16:39.506]  Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know, but she goes on to say, Annie Lynn, the name is, and she goes on to say about this business about, you know, the carbon dioxide, how dangerous.
[03:16:39.966 --> 03:16:42.448]  She just doesn't agree with the cap-and-trade approach.
[03:16:42.915 --> 03:16:46.797]  With Goldman Sachs and Enron, you know, which is all good.
[03:16:46.857 --> 03:16:47.577]  No, I hear you, Jim.
[03:16:47.657 --> 03:16:48.518]  I'll look into it.
[03:16:48.558 --> 03:16:49.418]  I appreciate the call.
[03:16:49.838 --> 03:16:50.899]  Kathy in Indiana.
[03:16:50.939 --> 03:16:51.859]  Kathy, you're on the air.
[03:16:51.879 --> 03:16:52.319]  Go ahead.
[03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:53.460]  Hello?
[03:16:53.980 --> 03:16:54.220]  Hi.
[03:16:54.941 --> 03:16:55.041]  Hi.
[03:16:55.061 --> 03:16:58.782]  Yes, I just wanted to make a comment on ClimateGate.
[03:16:59.763 --> 03:17:02.384]  And I noticed she was talking about climate control.
[03:17:02.424 --> 03:17:04.485]  It's not climate control, it's ClimateGate.
[03:17:05.285 --> 03:17:12.956]  And what they do is they take sales through there, and they mask the sales with a bunch of information about molecules.
[03:17:13.416 --> 03:17:20.025]  And it goes through a publishing company, it's like BookSurge, and it's like Jennifer Mueller, and she does a lot of things like that.
[03:17:20.706 --> 03:17:26.388]  They steal millions of dollars, and they manipulate all this stuff, and it goes with all the other stuff you guys are talking about.
[03:17:26.808 --> 03:17:35.111]  And it goes against Jesus, and I know that the Lord told me how much they hurt him, and he told me that they've done all this stuff, and I know... Well, thank you, Kathy.
[03:17:35.151 --> 03:17:36.271]  I appreciate your call.
[03:17:36.571 --> 03:17:37.571]  Dan in New Mexico.
[03:17:37.611 --> 03:17:38.432]  You're on the air, Dan.
[03:17:38.452 --> 03:17:38.892]  Go ahead.
[03:17:40.925 --> 03:17:51.163]  Hey Alex, I want to make a quick point that, you know, if carbon is so bad, then why is it that the vegetation off each side of the highway is bigger than the rest of the vegetation out in the rest of the desert?
[03:17:51.183 --> 03:17:52.805]  You know what I'm talking about?
[03:17:53.979 --> 03:18:04.182]  Yes, they've done studies, thousands of them, that plants grow faster, live longer, need less water when they have higher levels of carbon dioxide.
[03:18:04.382 --> 03:18:14.465]  And from the ice core and also mud core out of the bottoms of deep lakes going back hundreds of thousands of years, they know that carbon dioxide has been 20 times
[03:18:17.671 --> 03:18:17.971]  I think?
[03:18:33.607 --> 03:18:36.669]  The small amount that humans put out really has no effect either way.
[03:18:37.169 --> 03:18:48.115]  And that the planet is carbon dioxide starved right now compared to other periods that have transpired over the millions of years on this planet.
[03:18:48.555 --> 03:18:54.458]  The UN admits they picked carbon dioxide because they can then put a tax on all human activity.
[03:18:54.819 --> 03:18:58.501]  The average human exhales five and a half pounds of carbon dioxide a day.
[03:18:59.301 --> 03:19:02.123]  Yeah, and you know, my wife brought up a very good point.
[03:19:02.163 --> 03:19:05.305]  If they somehow are able to effectively control carbon dioxide,
[03:19:27.538 --> 03:19:32.010]  It's going to, uh, kill off the rainforests a little bit faster than man would, isn't it?
[03:19:33.922 --> 03:19:36.563]  Well, look, they picked it because it's part of the life cycle.
[03:19:36.923 --> 03:19:42.005]  Sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, oxygen is what the planet operates off of.
[03:19:42.445 --> 03:19:46.966]  Without any of those ingredients, you miss one of those, you have no life on this planet.
[03:19:47.467 --> 03:19:59.010]  You've got to have those four things in abundance, and they're putting a tax on the life cycle to set up a planetary dictatorship, world government, in their own words, the denial's over.
[03:19:59.170 --> 03:20:00.431]  When the electricity goes out,
[03:20:00.971 --> 03:20:04.612]  How will you boil water, cook dinner, light your home, or get news reports?
[03:20:04.853 --> 03:20:10.074]  Most families are not prepared for even the shortest power outage due to hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms, and so on.
[03:20:10.175 --> 03:20:15.677]  But you can prepare your family for emergencies and not spend a lot doing it with the amazing products from KaroStove.

[03:20:59.818 --> 03:21:00.659]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:21:00.859 --> 03:21:06.186]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:21:06.386 --> 03:21:06.807]  I get it.
[03:21:06.927 --> 03:21:16.279]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:21:16.539 --> 03:21:17.720]  That's not what's happening.
[03:21:17.940 --> 03:21:26.203]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:21:26.423 --> 03:21:29.684]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:21:29.804 --> 03:21:33.886]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:21:34.086 --> 03:21:35.647]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:21:35.687 --> 03:21:38.908]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[03:21:39.628 --> 03:21:43.250]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:21:43.450 --> 03:21:44.151]  You should, too.
[03:21:44.351 --> 03:21:45.332]  Find out what they know.
[03:21:45.492 --> 03:21:48.854]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:21:48.874 --> 03:21:48.934]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:48.955 --> 03:21:49.095]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:49.115 --> 03:21:49.335]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:21:49.355 --> 03:21:51.937]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:51.957 --> 03:21:53.638]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:53.658 --> 03:21:55.119]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:09.873 --> 03:22:12.534]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:12.554 --> 03:22:18.736]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:18.916 --> 03:22:23.958]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:24.118 --> 03:22:34.101]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:34.221 --> 03:22:36.322]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:36.563 --> 03:22:37.904]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:38.144 --> 03:22:40.425]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:40.605 --> 03:22:42.447]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:42.747 --> 03:22:47.510]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:47.890 --> 03:22:52.673]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:52.854 --> 03:22:56.996]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:59.153 --> 03:23:00.294]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:23:00.554 --> 03:23:03.816]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[03:23:04.196 --> 03:23:12.342]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together and food is always the expression of our shared love and caring.
[03:23:12.602 --> 03:23:13.923]  Here's an exciting announcement.
[03:23:14.043 --> 03:23:20.988]  From now until December 15th, all products that eFoods Direct provides are listed at 10% off the regular price.
[03:23:21.388 --> 03:23:24.790]  The holiday season is the time for peace, happiness, and security.
[03:23:25.010 --> 03:23:29.033]  What better way to ensure fearless hope for the future of our families than to have
[03:23:29.053 --> 03:23:31.394]  We have as much good food in our homes as possible.
[03:23:31.714 --> 03:23:38.618]  This year, in addition to the overall 10% savings, the holiday special is made up of the new prepared meals that taste great.
[03:23:39.019 --> 03:23:44.221]  It also comes with a free 7-day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate or as a gift.
[03:23:44.381 --> 03:23:45.662]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:45.682 --> 03:23:45.962]  That's 800-409-5633.
[03:23:46.002 --> 03:23:49.664]  We here at eFoods Direct wish you peace, security and plenty this holiday season.
[03:24:28.195 --> 03:24:29.376]  John, who's up next here?
[03:24:29.396 --> 03:24:33.540]  I'm gonna take a few more calls, then I'm getting into ClimateGate and all the huge developments there.
[03:24:33.580 --> 03:24:34.541]  Believe me, they're giant.
[03:24:35.082 --> 03:24:37.244]  We covered a lot of it with Mocton, but not all of it.
[03:24:37.484 --> 03:24:38.845]  I want to recap a bunch of it.
[03:24:39.346 --> 03:24:40.307]  That is coming up.
[03:24:40.707 --> 03:24:42.989]  Right now, let's, uh, who's up next, John?
[03:24:44.350 --> 03:24:45.251]  Dennis in Indiana.
[03:24:45.291 --> 03:24:46.132]  Dennis, you're on the air.
[03:24:46.172 --> 03:24:46.833]  Thanks for holding.
[03:24:47.930 --> 03:24:48.630]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:50.631]  I wanted to compliment you on a great job.
[03:24:51.231 --> 03:24:52.992]  I called in part of the control grid.
[03:24:53.052 --> 03:25:02.176]  I live in Bloomington, Indiana, which I don't mind giving my city because my local paper, the Herald Times, has put up a database on concealed carry holders.
[03:25:02.596 --> 03:25:12.721]  Yes, they do that as a form of harassment and to set the precedent, newspapers all over the country publish concealed carry owners as a form of harassment.
[03:25:12.821 --> 03:25:13.301]  It's horrible.
[03:25:14.537 --> 03:25:19.539]  Yeah, if you, uh, I don't know if you guys have Googled it and put it up, but it's the Herald Times in Bloomington.
[03:25:19.619 --> 03:25:20.439]  Is there any way to find it?
[03:25:20.459 --> 03:25:22.119]  No, no, I mean, I'm familiar with newspapers.
[03:25:22.479 --> 03:25:27.601]  I mean, just Google right now the term, newspapers publish concealed carry owners.
[03:25:28.321 --> 03:25:31.942]  I mean, just, just, just, it's, I've seen it hundreds of times.
[03:25:33.203 --> 03:25:35.544]  Wow, so unfortunately this is happening all over.
[03:25:35.564 --> 03:25:39.185]  I mean, they're ratcheting the big stuff on us and from the grassroots up.
[03:25:39.285 --> 03:25:40.065]  I mean, it's terrible.
[03:25:41.980 --> 03:25:44.021]  Yeah, let me tell the guys the right search term.
[03:25:44.542 --> 03:25:50.065]  It's newspapers publish names of concealed firearm permit owners.
[03:25:51.806 --> 03:25:54.627]  Newspapers publish identities of gun owners.
[03:25:54.908 --> 03:25:55.628]  Something like that.
[03:25:55.928 --> 03:25:58.130]  And you'll get thousands and thousands.
[03:25:58.350 --> 03:25:58.790]  Here it is.
[03:25:59.330 --> 03:26:02.172]  Tennessee newspaper publishes concealed gun permit list.
[03:26:02.912 --> 03:26:05.234]  Then it just goes on and on and on and on.
[03:26:05.254 --> 03:26:05.854]  51,000 hits.
[03:26:09.553 --> 03:26:10.894]  51,400 hits when you do that.
[03:26:10.954 --> 03:26:12.675]  Yes, it's horrible, sir.
[03:26:13.676 --> 03:26:16.779]  Okay, yeah, I just wanted to thank you and pass that information on to you, Alex.
[03:26:17.119 --> 03:26:17.900]  Keep up the good work.
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:19.021]  Thank you so much, Dennis.
[03:26:19.982 --> 03:26:21.803]  Let's talk to Michael and Mass.
[03:26:21.883 --> 03:26:22.804]  Michael, you're on the air.
[03:26:22.824 --> 03:26:24.325]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[03:26:24.766 --> 03:26:25.146]  Hey, buddy.
[03:26:26.487 --> 03:26:30.471]  I've got something I wanted to say, but on a lighter note.
[03:26:30.491 --> 03:26:32.713]  Have you seen the show Family Guy before?
[03:26:34.354 --> 03:26:35.375]  That's a cartoon, isn't it?
[03:26:36.010 --> 03:26:40.314]  Yeah, tell me Lord Monkton doesn't look like the character Stewie.
[03:26:40.354 --> 03:26:41.275]  Can I get a kick out of that?
[03:26:42.956 --> 03:26:43.637]  Nah, but I like him.
[03:26:43.697 --> 03:26:47.860]  But I'd like to talk about words and terms and understanding the language.
[03:26:49.882 --> 03:26:52.745]  Because I know you say it a million times, but people just don't get it.
[03:26:53.125 --> 03:26:55.067]  A lot of time these people aren't lying.
[03:26:55.447 --> 03:26:59.591]  They're not putting out misleading information.
[03:27:00.512 --> 03:27:03.334]  You don't speak English anymore, and I'll go through it.
[03:27:03.354 --> 03:27:11.578]  Alright, so last year in October 2008, the government passed what they called a bailout of the banking industry, right?
[03:27:11.638 --> 03:27:14.340]  Now, from where does someone generally get bailed out from?
[03:27:14.980 --> 03:27:16.821]  Prison, for criminal activity.
[03:27:17.402 --> 03:27:21.544]  So, if you really understood the language, you would have looked at that and you would have went, well, wait a minute.
[03:27:22.373 --> 03:27:26.855]  This is completely inappropriate for the government to be bailing out the bankers.
[03:27:27.155 --> 03:27:28.976]  You know, they're telling us... But it's worse than that.
[03:27:29.016 --> 03:27:29.877]  It was a lie.
[03:27:30.117 --> 03:27:34.119]  They gave them dictatorial power to steal trillions, not $700 billion.
[03:27:34.459 --> 03:27:37.880]  Day one, they baited and switched and said, oh, it's going to be to unfreeze mortgages.
[03:27:37.920 --> 03:27:43.483]  And then October 4th, the day after they passed it, they said, oh, we're not going to tell you where the money's going now.
[03:27:43.703 --> 03:27:45.084]  We're not going to use it for mortgages.
[03:27:47.394 --> 03:27:52.836]  And then Paulson sits up there, the former head of Goldman Sachs, and says, yes, I gave myself money from the bailout.
[03:27:53.217 --> 03:27:53.937]  I'm allowed to.
[03:27:53.997 --> 03:27:54.757]  I got a waiver.
[03:27:55.318 --> 03:28:01.961]  And the senator goes, it was actually Congressman Stern of Florida, says, and who gave you the waiver?
[03:28:03.502 --> 03:28:05.022]  It's in my film Fall of the Republic.
[03:28:05.763 --> 03:28:08.404]  And he says, oh, the Treasury Department.
[03:28:08.704 --> 03:28:09.905]  I gave myself a waiver.
[03:28:11.502 --> 03:28:12.163]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:28:30.040 --> 03:28:33.762]  I basically have to say, well, it's because you really don't speak English anymore.
[03:28:33.782 --> 03:28:34.963]  I mean, I don't know what it is.
[03:28:35.503 --> 03:28:40.326]  In 1984, of course, you'll remember, but for the listeners, I mean, what was it?
[03:28:40.547 --> 03:28:45.730]  There was that guy whose job it was to destroy the language until it was, quote, perfect.
[03:28:45.790 --> 03:28:47.391]  I mean, perfect according to who?
[03:28:47.871 --> 03:28:49.713]  Yeah, that was Newspeak.
[03:28:49.753 --> 03:28:52.315]  It was called Newspeak and it was Ingsoc.
[03:28:52.895 --> 03:28:53.976]  Double plus good.
[03:28:54.537 --> 03:28:58.900]  And they were reducing the language down so it would be impossible to even have a thought.
[03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:02.723]  Because from birth, you would be given limited language.
[03:29:02.984 --> 03:29:08.208]  So their job was to destroy the language and to boil it down to nothing.
[03:29:08.989 --> 03:29:09.689]  Freedom of speech.
[03:29:09.729 --> 03:29:12.531]  Imagine not being capable of speaking in the first place.
[03:29:12.591 --> 03:29:15.574]  I mean, they must have loved to have that kind of situation, right?
[03:29:17.694 --> 03:29:19.235]  I don't know.
[03:29:19.435 --> 03:29:20.416]  It just blows me away.
[03:29:20.436 --> 03:29:22.678]  The media, right?
[03:29:23.778 --> 03:29:28.082]  People talk about reality and what they think is potentially real.
[03:29:29.045 --> 03:29:32.626]  You know, I constantly tell people, you know, you don't even have to lie to the people anymore.
[03:29:32.726 --> 03:29:38.228]  You know, if you have control over all the information they get, you just have to omit important details, you know?
[03:29:38.388 --> 03:29:45.331]  Yeah, they lie a lot by omission, but also by spin and just flat-out lying, like saying polar bears are all dying and can't swim.
[03:29:45.551 --> 03:29:47.412]  Their numbers are exploding with the best land swimmer.
[03:29:49.052 --> 03:29:49.953]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.433 --> 03:29:52.054]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.974 --> 03:29:55.655]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.373 --> 03:30:02.355]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:30:02.475 --> 03:30:05.217]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:30:05.337 --> 03:30:06.597]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:30:06.617 --> 03:30:07.298]  It's very real.
[03:30:07.438 --> 03:30:09.559]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:30:09.679 --> 03:30:11.200]  And it's available right now to you.

[03:30:58.103 --> 03:31:02.345]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:31:02.645 --> 03:31:03.266]  Number one.
[03:31:03.566 --> 03:31:06.728]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:31:06.988 --> 03:31:07.568]  Number two.
[03:31:07.848 --> 03:31:12.411]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:31:12.751 --> 03:31:13.191]  It's true.
[03:31:13.491 --> 03:31:18.034]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:31:18.354 --> 03:31:18.895]  Number 3.
[03:31:19.175 --> 03:31:22.458]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:31:22.758 --> 03:31:26.501]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:31:26.681 --> 03:31:27.222]  Number 4.
[03:31:27.482 --> 03:31:29.844]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:31:30.244 --> 03:31:33.627]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:31:33.907 --> 03:31:34.128]  Number 5.
[03:31:34.688 --> 03:31:38.609]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:31:38.829 --> 03:31:43.610]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:31:43.890 --> 03:31:47.911]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:33:37.638 --> 03:33:42.900]  And the restreams will start for the internet audience of Jesse Ventura right at the start of the show.
[03:33:43.461 --> 03:33:44.101]  Exclusive.
[03:33:44.141 --> 03:33:45.782]  The last interview he's doing this year.
[03:33:46.342 --> 03:33:48.123]  He's going to Mexico in a couple days.
[03:33:48.143 --> 03:33:51.825]  Well, that's where he spends part of the year.
[03:33:52.266 --> 03:33:53.446]  His show is a big hit.
[03:33:53.886 --> 03:33:54.787]  Conspiracy Theory.
[03:33:54.827 --> 03:33:55.747]  I'm a consultant on it.
[03:33:55.767 --> 03:33:56.948]  I also appear on the show.
[03:33:56.968 --> 03:34:03.572]  I'm the only person to appear in multiple consecutive, what, four of the seven episodes.
[03:34:04.657 --> 03:34:08.499]  And that's the number one show on True TV in their history.
[03:34:08.579 --> 03:34:10.341]  Number one new show on True TV.
[03:34:11.481 --> 03:34:19.046]  And that's going to be premiering part two on 9-11 tomorrow night on True TV, formerly Court TV.
[03:34:19.066 --> 03:34:22.068]  So that's very, very exciting on that front.
[03:34:22.990 --> 03:34:36.313]  And then Lord Christopher Monckton, the king of exposing Climategate and the fraud, filing criminal complaints on the scientists caught red-handed, engaged in fraud, hiding the decline in the last nine years of global temperatures.
[03:34:37.193 --> 03:34:38.913]  That is coming up in the rebroadcast.
[03:34:38.933 --> 03:34:41.394]  I know a lot of AM and FM's re-air of the show.
[03:34:41.974 --> 03:34:46.595]  That is definitely a show that everyone is going to want to hear and see.
[03:34:47.415 --> 03:34:52.761]  This is so important, the fight that we're facing right now as a society.
[03:34:53.201 --> 03:34:55.904]  Global government is here.
[03:34:56.364 --> 03:34:59.347]  Global government is now upon us.
[03:35:01.490 --> 03:35:01.990]  And you know what?
[03:35:02.070 --> 03:35:04.092]  I have a Texas Monthly reporter here.
[03:35:04.973 --> 03:35:06.315]  We've actually interviewed before.
[03:35:08.342 --> 03:35:11.605]  I don't know if in the interview I'm going to argue with him about a world government existing or not.
[03:35:11.645 --> 03:35:15.487]  Maybe I should play for him what I played for the magazine reporter that was here yesterday.
[03:35:15.808 --> 03:35:25.095]  Clips of Al Gore, clips of the UN head, clips of the EU head, clips of other bureaucrats calling for global government and saying Copenhagen is the funding mechanism for all of this.
[03:35:27.765 --> 03:35:30.467]  They say they're here doing a profile, so I guess that's not what this is about.
[03:35:31.308 --> 03:35:38.213]  It's just that I'm tired of being called a conspiracy theorist when all we're doing is reading the documents and covering the facts here on air.
[03:35:39.734 --> 03:35:45.118]  Now a powerful article, and we're going to contact him and get him on, Gerald Warner, writer for the London Telegraph.
[03:35:45.739 --> 03:35:47.180]  Powerful article.
[03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:54.606]  Climategate, Barack Obama's rule by EPA decree is a coup d'etat against Congress made in Britain.
[03:35:55.748 --> 03:36:03.374]  And they talk about how the same systems in Britain and the EU are used to bypass parliaments and the elected legislatures.
[03:36:03.794 --> 03:36:10.419]  The EPA now announcing they're going to list carbon dioxide that plants breathe as a toxic waste.
[03:36:14.382 --> 03:36:17.585]  Who needs tanks on the lawn when you have the Environmental Protection Agency?
[03:36:17.985 --> 03:36:19.827]  Barack Obama's use of the EPA to
[03:36:21.397 --> 03:36:27.685]  Pressure of the Senate to pass his climate change Nuremberg decrees shows his dictatorial mentality.
[03:36:28.086 --> 03:36:35.736]  He wants to override Congress, which is hostile to the climate gobbledygook because it's representative of the American electric
[03:36:36.397 --> 03:36:37.337]  That's what's happening.
[03:36:37.357 --> 03:36:38.158]  That's what's going on.
[03:37:03.567 --> 03:37:18.278]  Continuing to expand on this, the biggest news of the day was Lord Monckton going to the United Nations in Copenhagen and threatening them with a House of Lords inquiry if they didn't give him the latest version of the Copenhagen Treaty, which was secret.
[03:37:18.999 --> 03:37:21.220]  The bureaucrats buckled and gave it to him.
[03:37:21.541 --> 03:37:29.126]  It has taxes on transportation, a global authority over air travel, a global tax on financial transactions.
[03:37:29.206 --> 03:37:30.748]  This is total control.
[03:37:32.301 --> 03:37:34.904]  700 plus new bureaucracies.
[03:37:35.304 --> 03:37:37.045]  Not agents.
[03:37:37.065 --> 03:37:42.310]  700 new bureaucracies over every facet of our lives.
[03:37:43.871 --> 03:37:49.195]  And on top of that now, we have this London Guardian story.
[03:37:49.675 --> 03:37:56.001]  Copenhagen Climate Summit in disarray after Danish techs leak.
[03:37:57.014 --> 03:37:59.496]  Now this is nothing new for our listeners.
[03:37:59.536 --> 03:38:01.337]  This information is nothing for you.
[03:38:01.698 --> 03:38:05.560]  It's all covered in the Fall of the Republic, in detail, because we have their own documents.
[03:38:05.620 --> 03:38:13.606]  But the UN had lied to the third world and told them, hey, we're going to loot America and England and Europe and Japan for you.
[03:38:13.747 --> 03:38:15.268]  You don't have to make any carbon cuts.
[03:38:15.708 --> 03:38:20.632]  We're going to loot them and we're going to give all of that money
[03:38:21.874 --> 03:38:22.374]  To you.
[03:38:22.555 --> 03:38:23.415]  Totally made up.
[03:38:23.755 --> 03:38:28.159]  This is the same IMF and World Bank whose documents got leaked in 2002.
[03:38:28.579 --> 03:38:31.241]  Joseph Stiklitz resigned and went public and exposed it.
[03:38:31.581 --> 03:38:32.922]  Nobel Prize winning economist.
[03:38:33.183 --> 03:38:42.850]  How they go into countries and pay them at 30% loan sharking rates not to pay the debts back to hand over the entire infrastructures of their countries to the IMF and World Bank.
[03:38:43.891 --> 03:38:49.415]  So imagine their horror when they saw the new addendum to the secret treaty today leaked
[03:38:51.360 --> 03:38:52.061]  Now listen to this.
[03:38:52.161 --> 03:38:58.051]  Developing countries react furiously to leaked draft agreement that would hand more power to rich nations.
[03:38:58.532 --> 03:39:00.896]  It's not the rich nations, it's the banks sitting in our nations.
[03:39:01.336 --> 03:39:05.523]  Sideline the UN's negotiating role and abandon the Kyoto Protocol.
[03:39:06.368 --> 03:39:16.730]  See, this is going to be selective taxes on the West, freezing development in the third world, and paying the money, it says, to the IMF, World Bank, and private banking subsidiaries.
[03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:24.312]  That is... We have the full text up on Infowars.com.
[03:39:25.392 --> 03:39:31.954]  You can also go to this article in the London Guardian titled, Copenhagen Climate Summon and Disarray.
[03:39:33.382 --> 03:39:37.804]  And the first link, read the Danish text, and it's in English.
[03:39:38.624 --> 03:39:41.005]  Let's do that live on television right now.
[03:39:41.705 --> 03:39:43.346]  Radio listeners can just go to the site and click.
[03:39:43.746 --> 03:39:48.248]  I want people to see the article, and I want you to see the document.
[03:39:48.968 --> 03:39:50.089]  And I want you to go read it.
[03:39:50.829 --> 03:39:53.170]  And I want you to see it for yourself.
[03:39:56.195 --> 03:40:05.473]  The UN Copenhagen climate talks are in disarray today after developing countries reacted furiously to leaked documents that show that world leaders will next week be asked...
[03:40:07.281 --> 03:40:15.225]  To sign an agreement that hands over power to rich countries and sidelines the UN role in all future climate change negotiations.
[03:40:15.566 --> 03:40:24.691]  The document is also being interpreted by developing countries as setting unequal limits on per capita carbon emissions for developed and developing countries.
[03:40:25.391 --> 03:40:29.873]  Meaning that people in rich countries would be permitted to emit nearly twice as much under the proposals.
[03:40:30.254 --> 03:40:33.596]  What does this eugenicist document say from 1977 written by
[03:40:36.357 --> 03:40:37.378]  John P. Holdren.
[03:40:37.498 --> 03:40:39.760]  What does the Club of Rome 1991 say?
[03:40:41.261 --> 03:40:43.502]  What does the Royal Commission out of England say?
[03:40:43.963 --> 03:40:46.745]  What does State Department Memorandum 200 written by Kissinger say?
[03:40:47.305 --> 03:40:53.590]  They are going to shut down the carbon footprint of the third world for eugenics.
[03:40:54.350 --> 03:40:58.874]  Cue up the Berlin Film Festival winning video that shows humans as parasites.
[03:40:59.898 --> 03:41:10.187]  They state in here that they want a population reduction of at least 80% and call for adding hormones to the water to sterilize the population.
[03:41:10.667 --> 03:41:13.610]  Now, did you hear me?
[03:41:13.970 --> 03:41:17.093]  Twice the cuts in the third world!
[03:41:17.133 --> 03:41:23.659]  They go to the moron third world and they tell them, oh we're the IMF and World Bank that have raped you.
[03:41:25.970 --> 03:41:30.775]  And they go to him and they say, you're going to get all of America's money if you sign on to this.
[03:41:30.795 --> 03:41:35.760]  Then they actually get the text, and it says, oh, you're going to have double the taxes!
[03:41:36.901 --> 03:41:37.621]  Of course!
[03:41:39.363 --> 03:41:40.004]  Of course!
[03:41:40.084 --> 03:41:46.210]  It's feudalism, it's imperium, it's empire, it's a global corporate tax to the private global government.
[03:41:48.152 --> 03:41:48.832]  Now don't worry.
[03:41:49.393 --> 03:41:51.013]  You think the third world are morons?
[03:41:51.213 --> 03:42:10.301]  They're geniuses compared to stupid yuppies in the West who think it's cute and funny and have TerraPass and GreenPass and these stickers on their cars where they're already paying a tithe, an indulgence, like to the church, but to private corporations for carbon credits.
[03:42:10.722 --> 03:42:16.344]  And they're already trading the carbon credits on the global exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile, the London Exchange.
[03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:18.980]  So did you hear that?
[03:42:21.822 --> 03:42:35.749]  Developing countries are setting unequal limits on per capita carbon emissions for developed and developing countries, meaning that people in rich countries would be permitted to emit nearly twice as much under the proposals.
[03:42:36.129 --> 03:42:38.210]  What did Maury Strong say?
[03:42:38.570 --> 03:42:41.952]  I read the quotes directly yesterday, here on air.
[03:42:42.252 --> 03:42:43.493]  What did Maury Strong say?
[03:42:44.233 --> 03:42:45.274]  I have that list here somewhere.
[03:42:45.294 --> 03:42:45.835]  I can read it again.
[03:42:46.095 --> 03:42:52.360]  He said, we must destroy the industrial societies and that's what the carbon tax will do.
[03:42:52.780 --> 03:42:55.863]  Destroy our society.
[03:42:55.943 --> 03:42:56.523]  Destroy it.
[03:42:56.563 --> 03:42:58.265]  The third world doesn't have one yet.
[03:42:58.565 --> 03:43:07.813]  This is meant to keep them from getting an industrial society, which then they'll actually have less children if you believe that the world's overpopulated, which is the moron common knowledge.
[03:43:08.740 --> 03:43:08.940]  No.
[03:43:09.581 --> 03:43:11.622]  There are some dirty technologies we need to phase out.
[03:43:11.982 --> 03:43:13.083]  This has nothing to do with it.
[03:43:13.443 --> 03:43:26.431]  But again, you go to the London Guardian, Copenhagen Climate Summit and Disruptor Danish Texts League, you click on it, and then you can read the PDF for yourself.
[03:43:26.531 --> 03:43:27.412]  So, there you go.
[03:43:27.572 --> 03:43:29.833]  This is a raping of the third world.
[03:43:29.853 --> 03:43:33.696]  The so-called Danish Texts, a secret draft agreement worked on
[03:43:36.343 --> 03:43:45.879]  By a group of individuals known as the Circle of Commitment, but understood to include UK, US and Denmark, has been shown to a handful of countries since it finalized this week.
[03:43:47.055 --> 03:43:47.716]  And it goes on.
[03:43:47.996 --> 03:43:53.341]  Force developing countries to agree to specific emissions cuts and measures that were not part of the original UN agreement.
[03:43:53.682 --> 03:43:55.063]  See, they're already expanding it.
[03:43:55.083 --> 03:44:00.728]  It's not enough to put taxes on all money transfers and wire transfers and economic transactions.
[03:44:00.989 --> 03:44:04.552]  It's not enough to create a global authority over all air travel with taxes.
[03:44:04.992 --> 03:44:10.678]  It's not enough to put taxes on all beef, all chicken, all meat, all fuel, all heating oil.
[03:44:10.958 --> 03:44:11.699]  It's not enough.
[03:44:13.496 --> 03:44:18.980]  Divide poor countries further by creating a new category of developed countries called the most vulnerable.
[03:44:19.080 --> 03:44:22.343]  That means IMF and World Bank controlled nations that really want to rape.
[03:44:22.964 --> 03:44:25.405]  Weaken the UN's role in handling climate finance.
[03:44:25.606 --> 03:44:30.229]  Because the UN is only a fake debating society with a General Assembly with no power.
[03:44:30.570 --> 03:44:36.975]  It's the UN Security Council and it's 15 members that Obama heads that has all the power!
[03:44:39.031 --> 03:44:51.120]  Not allow poor countries to emit more than 1.44 tons of carbon per person, while allowing rich countries to emit a lot more, 2.67 tons or twice that.
[03:44:52.521 --> 03:45:01.868]  Developing countries have been seen the text or understood to be furious that it is being promoted by rich countries without their knowledge and without discussion in the negotiations.
[03:45:03.029 --> 03:45:06.992]  It goes on to say they're setting up a global environmental facility with global government power.
[03:45:09.417 --> 03:45:12.320]  Here's a London Telegraph article talking about global government.
[03:45:13.081 --> 03:45:16.705]  Uses the term New World Order and global government.
[03:45:25.925 --> 03:45:34.610]  Meanwhile, they are engaged in biblical-level frauds with giant billboards, TV ads, globally, with little girls in the picture.
[03:45:34.850 --> 03:45:36.230]  Please don't let me drown.
[03:45:36.611 --> 03:45:37.511]  I'm gonna drown.
[03:45:37.811 --> 03:45:42.834]  Schwarzenegger says San Francisco, 938 feet above sea level, is gonna be underwater.
[03:45:43.054 --> 03:45:45.255]  This is asinine baloney!
[03:45:47.456 --> 03:45:48.037]  Oh, man.
[03:45:53.299 --> 03:45:54.200]  You found the quotes?
[03:45:59.275 --> 03:45:59.975]  Yeah, I don't see them.
[03:46:00.736 --> 03:46:03.697]  There's so many quotes, so many documents, how do I even keep track of it all?
[03:46:05.558 --> 03:46:06.619]  Ah, yes, here are the quotes.
[03:46:07.599 --> 03:46:09.220]  Let me find the Maury Strong.
[03:46:09.700 --> 03:46:13.422]  Isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse?
[03:46:13.842 --> 03:46:16.423]  Isn't it our responsibility to bring about that?
[03:46:16.924 --> 03:46:17.664]  Maury Strong.
[03:46:20.020 --> 03:46:23.102]  A massive campaign must be launched to de-develop the United States.
[03:46:23.503 --> 03:46:28.646]  De-development means bringing our economic system in line with the realities of ecological and world resource situation.
[03:46:28.687 --> 03:46:35.812]  Paul Ehrlich, co-author of Ecoscience with the White House Science Czar calling for forcibly sterilizing you.
[03:46:40.543 --> 03:46:51.621]  Meanwhile, there's this article from Playboy 1969, Gore Vidal, the cousin of Al Gore, calling for a global government for forced one-child policies.
[03:46:53.012 --> 03:46:54.212]  You gotta go read this article.
[03:46:54.252 --> 03:46:59.014]  Gore Vidal endorses environmental authority to regulate breeding and license births.
[03:46:59.314 --> 03:47:03.095]  How long have they worked for the plan that we now see unfolding globally?
[03:47:03.515 --> 03:47:06.235]  How long have they been setting up this scam?
[03:47:06.455 --> 03:47:08.916]  How long have they been pushing for this fraud?
[03:47:09.296 --> 03:47:19.959]  Because even people that expose them as a fraud, and people that know Polar Bear's numbers are expanding, that the ice caps are getting bigger, they still think they're just a well-meaning idiot environmentalist.
[03:47:20.459 --> 03:47:22.621]  No, they're not well-meaning idiot environmentalists.
[03:47:22.641 --> 03:47:23.662]  The low-level people are.
[03:47:24.202 --> 03:47:29.427]  The leadership of this, like Queen Beatrix, whose husband founded Bilderberg and the World Wildlife Fund.
[03:47:29.807 --> 03:47:35.712]  Prince Bernhard was a top Nazi and eugenicist, and set it up with the admitted eugenicist, Prince Philip.
[03:47:38.188 --> 03:47:50.518]  Who gave interviews to mainstream newspapers and wrote the forward to the book, If I Was an Animal, saying he wants to come back reincarnated as a particularly deadly virus.
[03:47:51.567 --> 03:47:54.048]  To kill more than 80% of the world's population.
[03:47:54.708 --> 03:47:57.428]  What does Dr. Eric Pionka at the University of Texas say?
[03:47:57.668 --> 03:48:01.049]  He can't wait for airborne Ebola to kill 90% of the world.
[03:48:01.229 --> 03:48:03.230]  And we've got to kill 90% of the world.
[03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:12.172]  And then his graduate students, who are working in bioweapons labs, publish his papers for their PhD, calling for killing all humans.
[03:48:14.513 --> 03:48:16.433]  This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:48:16.473 --> 03:48:20.054]  These people couldn't be more monstrous.
[03:48:20.970 --> 03:48:25.034]  These people couldn't be more out of control.
[03:48:26.216 --> 03:48:29.099]  These people couldn't be more wicked.
[03:48:34.164 --> 03:48:41.532]  Here's the video where they teach school children, this is shown in schools all over the world that speak English, that humans are a disease.
[03:48:41.932 --> 03:48:42.353]  Here it is.
[03:48:46.628 --> 03:48:47.048]  Our Earth.
[03:48:47.509 --> 03:48:49.610]  Healthy, strong, and full of life.
[03:48:49.650 --> 03:48:50.131]  But wait!
[03:48:50.571 --> 03:48:51.632]  What's that you've got there?
[03:48:52.853 --> 03:48:55.094]  It looks like you've got a case of the humans!
[03:48:56.015 --> 03:49:01.219]  To be a healthy Earth, all of your elements must be in equilibrium.
[03:49:03.800 --> 03:49:06.662]  However, these parasites slaughter all other forms of life.
[03:49:09.865 --> 03:49:11.426]  Guzzle your natural resources.
[03:49:14.947 --> 03:49:21.610]  So that's what the elite think of us, when they're really the parasites.
[03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:46.652]  Meanwhile, humans are incredible creatures.
[03:49:46.753 --> 03:49:48.535]  We make many of the environments we're in better.
[03:49:50.237 --> 03:49:55.203]  The planet was born in the radiation bath of the sun with volcanic eruptions.
[03:49:55.383 --> 03:50:01.410]  One volcano puts out more toxic waste than all human activity in a hundred years if it's a big gaseous Mount St.
[03:50:01.450 --> 03:50:02.532]  Helens type explosion.
[03:50:04.548 --> 03:50:05.669]  But notice the double think.
[03:50:05.949 --> 03:50:09.452]  Oh, it consumes your resources, the human, but you're also a parasite.
[03:50:09.772 --> 03:50:10.773]  So it's double think.
[03:50:11.493 --> 03:50:23.002]  And we showed you the ABC News out of Australia reporting on how the school show cartoons teaching kids to commit suicide at age 11 because that's when their carbon footprint runs out.
[03:50:23.262 --> 03:50:26.645]  And then Newsweek with the cover story, The Case for Killing Granny.
[03:50:28.291 --> 03:50:30.072]  That's how these sickos are operating.
[03:50:30.652 --> 03:50:35.655]  I'm gonna come back, go through my notes on all the other latest climate scam fraud news.
[03:50:36.495 --> 03:50:39.437]  Jesse Ventura came fully out against the ClimateGate fraud.
[03:50:39.817 --> 03:50:41.598]  He's coming up in T-minus 10 minutes.
[03:50:42.518 --> 03:50:44.819]  It's not on your local AM and FM, the rebroadcast.
[03:50:44.859 --> 03:50:49.702]  You can listen at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv where we archive it.
[03:50:50.682 --> 03:50:52.323]  Jesse Ventura at the start of the show.
[03:50:53.504 --> 03:50:54.984]  Lord Mocton, hour number two.
[03:50:55.405 --> 03:50:57.786]  Even more powerful than the interview we did a couple weeks ago.
[03:51:00.165 --> 03:51:01.646]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here.
[03:51:02.186 --> 03:51:04.688]  If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up.
[03:51:04.908 --> 03:51:07.169]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[03:51:07.849 --> 03:51:13.533]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family.
[03:51:13.853 --> 03:51:14.453]  Here's why.
[03:51:14.593 --> 03:51:22.338]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[03:51:22.778 --> 03:51:26.300]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[03:51:26.840 --> 03:51:29.182]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank.
[03:51:29.719 --> 03:51:32.260]  That can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[03:51:32.721 --> 03:51:33.621]  And here's the best part.
[03:51:34.242 --> 03:51:41.125]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[03:51:41.766 --> 03:51:45.828]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[03:51:46.068 --> 03:51:47.789]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:51:48.169 --> 03:51:52.232]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[03:52:01.036 --> 03:52:04.685]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:05.066 --> 03:52:08.073]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:08.313 --> 03:52:09.716]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:10.416 --> 03:52:13.097]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:13.117 --> 03:52:19.318]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:19.478 --> 03:52:24.519]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:24.659 --> 03:52:27.820]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:52:27.840 --> 03:52:34.661]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:34.781 --> 03:52:36.881]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:37.122 --> 03:52:38.462]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:38.702 --> 03:52:40.982]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:41.162 --> 03:52:43.003]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:43.023 --> 03:52:48.044]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:48.444 --> 03:52:53.205]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:53.445 --> 03:52:57.546]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:59.731 --> 03:53:02.993]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[03:53:03.313 --> 03:53:09.537]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[03:53:09.757 --> 03:53:10.017]  Why?
[03:53:10.237 --> 03:53:12.098]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[03:53:12.258 --> 03:53:15.300]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[03:53:15.560 --> 03:53:19.765]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[03:53:20.005 --> 03:53:23.429]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[03:53:23.669 --> 03:53:29.255]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.
[03:53:29.415 --> 03:53:36.203]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights, and is perfect for homeschoolers, business promotion.
[03:53:36.203 --> 03:53:36.623]  We're good.
[03:54:19.401 --> 03:54:22.363]  Oh yeah, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[03:54:22.463 --> 03:54:23.424]  Final segment.
[03:54:28.066 --> 03:54:31.188]  The good news is UN climate chief.
[03:54:31.469 --> 03:54:33.890]  Oh, the global government will control our climate.
[03:54:34.210 --> 03:54:35.511]  First, it was global freezing.
[03:54:36.031 --> 03:54:40.854]  Covered a Newsweek, 1977, telling you that the whole Earth was going to freeze.
[03:54:41.415 --> 03:54:44.277]  Forbes has got an article about that, if you didn't pay them carbon taxes.
[03:54:45.077 --> 03:54:49.840]  Then in the 90s and it was global warming, now suddenly it's climate change!
[03:54:49.880 --> 03:54:51.421]  You can't have change in the climate!
[03:54:51.901 --> 03:54:54.763]  We're on a planetoid going through space.
[03:54:54.863 --> 03:54:56.203]  The sun is the main driver.
[03:54:56.784 --> 03:55:04.108]  And I know most of you understand that, but we've got to get out there to the young people and others that have been taught it's so trendy to be slaves.
[03:55:04.548 --> 03:55:07.370]  It's so trendy to be taxed more to drive your car and be tracked.
[03:55:07.690 --> 03:55:09.991]  It's so trendy to have home inspectors in your house.
[03:55:10.331 --> 03:55:13.233]  It's so trendy to have an unelected global government.
[03:55:14.878 --> 03:55:16.720]  Controlling every facet of your lives.
[03:55:16.820 --> 03:55:39.382]  And I just cannot stress enough how huge it is, and I'm going to the front page of PrisonPlanet.com right now, to have the leaked addendum to the Copenhagen Global Government Treaty, and to have that treaty openly state that it's meant to shut down the third world.
[03:55:43.769 --> 03:55:45.090]  There's another crazy article.
[03:55:45.190 --> 03:55:50.174]  Guru of Science Czar Holdren called for doubling CO2 emissions.
[03:55:55.058 --> 03:55:55.558]  That's right.
[03:55:57.640 --> 03:56:03.184]  He said that large amounts of it should be pumped in the atmosphere to stop global freezing.
[03:56:03.464 --> 03:56:07.387]  See, they try to guess whether we're going into a cold or hot cycle.
[03:56:07.687 --> 03:56:09.549]  They all know as scientists that it's
[03:56:10.888 --> 03:56:12.409]  The sun driving most of it.
[03:56:12.689 --> 03:56:13.749]  They know it's going to get hot.
[03:56:13.809 --> 03:56:14.629]  It's going to get cold.
[03:56:15.750 --> 03:56:16.950]  They know it goes through cycles.
[03:56:16.970 --> 03:56:20.851]  So they try to bet and go, okay, we think it's about to get real cold.
[03:56:20.891 --> 03:56:28.033]  We'll scare everybody and say, give us global government and let us tax and run your lives.
[03:56:28.074 --> 03:56:29.134]  You're going to freeze to death.
[03:56:29.154 --> 03:56:32.735]  And then it starts getting hotter and they go, Oh, give us global government.
[03:56:32.775 --> 03:56:35.436]  Let us tax and trace everything you're doing or
[03:56:36.783 --> 03:56:41.906]  You're gonna burn up, and the oceans are gonna massively rise and flood you.
[03:56:43.307 --> 03:56:48.750]  And then it starts cooling off again, and they go, okay, any change in climate is unnatural.
[03:56:49.250 --> 03:56:57.315]  This is exactly what Aztec priests did, or what Babylonian priests did 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 years ago.
[03:56:58.696 --> 03:57:05.260]  The priest, or the scammer class, the fraud class, the original magicians, the con artists,
[03:57:06.496 --> 03:57:12.380]  They'd throw some gunpowder in a fire, it would explode, and they'd say, I have magic.
[03:57:12.700 --> 03:57:15.402]  Give me the best food, the best hut, the best women.
[03:57:16.553 --> 03:57:27.700]  And then they would map the stars, and they knew that every certain amount of time, the sun would disappear in an eclipse, and the moon would disappear, and they would have a big ritual.
[03:57:28.221 --> 03:57:35.245]  And to make everyone supplicate and prove their worship of them, they would say, give me your firstborn, I'm gonna cut their heart out.
[03:57:35.566 --> 03:57:36.726]  The gods demand it.
[03:57:37.367 --> 03:57:40.989]  And they really knew it was psychological warfare, just making people submit to them.
[03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:45.052]  And sometimes, the people would say, we're not gonna give you our children, and then they would go, okay,
[03:57:46.345 --> 03:57:50.366]  And an eclipse was coming up, and they'd say, Ooga Booga Noonga Choonga!
[03:57:50.786 --> 03:57:54.767]  And then, everybody would see the sun disappear, or the moon, and they'd go, Ah!
[03:57:55.327 --> 03:57:55.427]  Ah!
[03:57:55.787 --> 03:57:56.367]  Bring it back!
[03:57:56.387 --> 03:57:58.968]  And he would say, Do you give me and my family complete power?
[03:57:59.348 --> 03:58:04.369]  We are no longer just high priests, we are now the royal dynasty of the Toltec Kingdom!
[03:58:04.689 --> 03:58:06.190]  They would say, Ah!
[03:58:07.410 --> 03:58:07.450]  Ah!
[03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:12.211]  And just, you know, build me palaces then, or the sun won't come back!
[03:58:12.951 --> 03:58:13.692]  I am God!
[03:58:14.112 --> 03:58:15.052]  I am Gaboogoo!
[03:58:16.783 --> 03:58:18.184]  And that's all Al Gore's doing.
[03:58:18.224 --> 03:58:19.785]  He says, I am Ba-goo-boo!
[03:58:20.185 --> 03:58:21.146]  Give me billions!
[03:58:21.386 --> 03:58:22.747]  Give me Nobel Prizes!
[03:58:23.187 --> 03:58:24.808]  I will stop what plants breathe!
[03:58:24.968 --> 03:58:26.289]  The polar bears are dying!
[03:58:26.970 --> 03:58:28.010]  Oxygen is evil!
[03:58:28.291 --> 03:58:29.211]  Gas is evil!
[03:58:29.612 --> 03:58:30.492]  I will rule you!
[03:58:30.512 --> 03:58:31.813]  World government!
[03:58:32.193 --> 03:58:33.114]  I am your king!
[03:58:33.634 --> 03:58:33.974]  Publix!
