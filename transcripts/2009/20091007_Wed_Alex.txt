[00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.110]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.891]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:09.631]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.212]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:12.152]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:16.953]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:21.014]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:31.408]  I always love surprises and today's radio show will be extremely power-packed.
[00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:35.309]  We got David Icke joining us today from the United States.
[00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.949]  He's out in New Mexico.
[00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.631]  We got Max Keiser on the death of the dollar that now seems to be imminent.
[00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:46.051]  And then Alan Watt of Cutting Through the Matrix.
[00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:47.252]  All three today.
[00:00:47.252 --> 00:00:51.213]  If that isn't a power-packed, informative lineup, I don't know what is.
[00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:58.136]  So, coming up, David Icke, Max Keiser, and Alan Watt on the show.
[00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:16.929]  But all of that is overshadowed by the dollar plunging to record lows, gold surging, surging right up to $1,048 and change today.
[00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:18.810]  And that's the last time I checked an hour ago.
[00:01:20.162 --> 00:01:24.646]  Before I worked on other news stories here at the office.
[00:01:24.646 --> 00:01:40.519]  Now, we've got articles posted that make the point the dollar tumbling and gold exploding, gold rising like a Saturn rocket into the sky is not cause for celebration.
[00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:42.541]  I will assure you.
[00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.903]  I would have loved to have been wrong about all of this.
[00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:46.504]  I would have loved to not
[00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:58.020]  I've read Club of Rome and UN documents and George Soros statements and seen what the globalists have done in third world countries over and over again and first world nations.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.980]  I would have loved for them to be liars, but they are not liars.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:15.103]  I mean, they lie to the public about general everyday issues, but when they write their own policy reports, they talk about how we're scum and slaves and all the things they're doing to us and how stupid we are and how they're going to hurt us real bad.
[00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:16.023]  And it's a religion.
[00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:28.209]  A masochistic religion of enslavement and domination and they think of you as lower than whale crap.
[00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.914]  They think of you as the lowest of the low.
[00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:43.685]  And when you listen to the news or listen to news radio, it is just almost all complete government worship and propaganda.
[00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.287]  You know, you don't trust people in private business.
[00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:48.269]  You don't trust neighbors you don't know.
[00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.194]  You know there's a lot of swindlers and scammers and liars and unethical people out there of every stripe.
[00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:59.537]  Why do we just suddenly love and worship governments stomping around in black uniforms?
[00:02:59.537 --> 00:03:00.638]  The truth is we don't.
[00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:13.584]  Everybody knows the government's corrupt, but a lot of people are cowards and they just worship government, worship corruption, worship power, thinking if they grovel that somehow they'll end up winning.
[00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:17.526]  They're so self-centered that they destroy their own future.
[00:03:17.526 --> 00:03:21.908]  They think they get ahead by groveling to tyranny when in truth they destroy the society they live in.
[00:03:23.663 --> 00:03:27.146]  And they miss out on what it is to truly be a human being.
[00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:33.031]  So we're gonna break all this down, and then just the insane Orwellian news.
[00:03:33.031 --> 00:03:42.379]  I'm even starting to pinch myself.
[00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.384]  I mean, IBM is coming out with a DNA barcode reader that just scans your body.
[00:03:49.557 --> 00:03:50.838]  That is the mark of the beast.
[00:03:50.838 --> 00:03:53.079]  That is the global cashless society.
[00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.561]  You're not going to just pay with your retina or your thumbprint.
[00:03:55.561 --> 00:03:58.883]  Your DNA.
[00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:00.685]  This is a religion of DNA.
[00:04:00.685 --> 00:04:03.687]  This is a eugenics cult.
[00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:05.428]  Everything is race.
[00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:07.749]  Everything is genetics.
[00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:11.352]  To the New World Order.
[00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:15.294]  Everything is your genealogy and who you came from.
[00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:17.576]  The New World Order won't even talk to you.
[00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:27.091]  Unless you've got a very, very high IQ and unless you've got bloodlines that go back into their bloodlines.
[00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:34.216]  And it doesn't matter if it's the Japanese leadership or the German royal family that runs England.
[00:04:34.216 --> 00:04:40.980]  This is a eugenics cult.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.922]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back after this quick break.
[00:04:46.388 --> 00:04:48.170]  And break it all down.
[00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.773]  This is a massively important radio show.
[00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:51.814]  Call everybody you know.
[00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:53.196]  Tell them, tune in today.
[00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:56.079]  We're witnessing the beginning of the end of this country.
[00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:58.622]  We're witnessing the fall of the Republic.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.823]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:13.905]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:16.566]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:23.152]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.152 --> 00:05:27.216]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:32.522]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:34.903]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:34.903 --> 00:05:36.664]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.664 --> 00:05:39.186]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:43.908]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:47.630]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.752]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:50.752 --> 00:05:52.653]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:53.674]  One last time.
[00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:54.754]  It's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:06:00.814 --> 00:06:06.539]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.820]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.862]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:16.888]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.888 --> 00:06:25.415]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:32.909]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:36.073]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.073 --> 00:06:41.140]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.422]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:06:43.422 --> 00:06:45.964]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:19.084]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to FluScam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:30.669]  Learn why Barack Obama's ScienceR recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:07:31.463 --> 00:07:34.564]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:07:34.564 --> 00:07:38.645]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family.
[00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:42.426]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:07:42.426 --> 00:07:47.987]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[00:07:47.987 --> 00:07:51.128]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[00:07:51.128 --> 00:07:54.069]  Call toll-free 888-KO-GERMS.
[00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:56.729]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:58.230]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.490]  This call could save your life.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.242]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:31.141 --> 00:08:35.168]  Welcome, welcome my friends.
[00:08:35.168 --> 00:08:37.131]  It's a very sad day for our country.
[00:08:39.022 --> 00:08:41.664]  But at the same time, at least we were aware of it.
[00:08:41.664 --> 00:08:49.990]  Tens of millions of us were aware of who the enemy was, what they're doing, who they are, what makes them tick, and why they're doing what they're doing.
[00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.751]  At least we know that.
[00:08:51.751 --> 00:09:02.399]  And record numbers of free human beings across the planet know of the eugenics wars, they know of the New World Order, and they are learning more every day.
[00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.820]  Once you have a taste of the truth,
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.385]  No amount of smiling Infobabes looking into the teleprompters with sexual desire will manipulate you anymore.
[00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:14.528]  You will break your conditioning.
[00:09:14.528 --> 00:09:15.629]  Though it is mind control.
[00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:26.898]  I was jogging on the treadmill this morning again, watching the different Infobabes on Fox and CNN, and the way they smile, the way they laugh, and the way they blink their eyes, and the way... I mean, it's like when a woman
[00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:45.315]  When you're sitting there at a candlelight dinner with your wife or girlfriend, and there's that real moment of falling into each other's eyes, like looking into pools of water, and there's that tension where, you know, the woman is just ready to go, and you're ready to go.
[00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:49.217]  And they sit there and they're coached.
[00:09:49.217 --> 00:09:51.140]  This has been admitted for more than a decade.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.065]  Before it was the main fatherly authority figure that you could trust.
[00:09:55.065 --> 00:09:58.188]  But now they found it's even more effective to just go with women.
[00:09:58.188 --> 00:09:59.851]  Good-looking women.
[00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:03.215]  Because they found women like to watch good-looking women.
[00:10:03.215 --> 00:10:04.837]  And men like to watch good-looking women.
[00:10:06.294 --> 00:10:11.717]  And they still have younger, you know, 35 cool guys on during the day for the women.
[00:10:11.717 --> 00:10:14.659]  They have shows that are... It's all geared around women.
[00:10:14.659 --> 00:10:18.901]  80 plus percent of advertising targets women.
[00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:22.623]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:25.325]  It's not that women are bad or stupid.
[00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:27.786]  It's that women are the center of the household.
[00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:31.288]  Women are the cornerstone of the family.
[00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:37.744]  And the truth is, where women go, society follows.
[00:10:37.744 --> 00:10:43.268]  And then it's men who go out and defend the women and defend the children.
[00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:46.971]  And you've got to have somebody who makes decisions and splits second crises.
[00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:50.774]  So, societally, in every culture, it's been the man is, quote, the leader.
[00:10:50.774 --> 00:10:55.797]  But in true dynamic societies, women have and always will be the center of society.
[00:10:55.797 --> 00:10:57.299]  So, they've turned them against men.
[00:10:57.299 --> 00:11:00.281]  Another divide and conquer tactic.
[00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:01.802]  They brought them in as the house slaves.
[00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:05.190]  61% of college graduates in the U.S.
[00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.070]  are women.
[00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.611]  Women only have a 6% unemployment rate.
[00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:09.772]  Men have an 11%.
[00:11:09.772 --> 00:11:10.812]  That's the Fed's own numbers.
[00:11:10.812 --> 00:11:11.533]  It's actually double.
[00:11:11.533 --> 00:11:17.275]  So it's 12% for women and 20 or higher for men.
[00:11:17.275 --> 00:11:19.736]  And this is a celebration of evil!
[00:11:19.736 --> 00:11:24.358]  Men are reduced to mindless Brett Favre fans or John Elway fans.
[00:11:25.886 --> 00:11:27.867]  And that's their manhood.
[00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:29.268]  That's who they are.
[00:11:29.268 --> 00:11:31.329]  They've been totally emasculated.
[00:11:31.329 --> 00:11:34.730]  They wear the tribal jersey of their tribe.
[00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.351]  They don't actually go out and conquer.
[00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:38.552]  They don't actually go out in business and succeed.
[00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:39.673]  They don't invent.
[00:11:39.673 --> 00:11:46.016]  They don't actually trailblaze and explore and do what men are supposed to do.
[00:11:46.016 --> 00:11:46.416]  No, no.
[00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:50.098]  They look at daredevils that jump over the defensive line.
[00:11:50.098 --> 00:11:53.339]  They cheer on the track star.
[00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:54.180]  They cheer on
[00:11:56.786 --> 00:12:03.669]  The championship goalie or the golf player.
[00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:04.689]  That's what's really happening.
[00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:07.971]  That's what's really going on.
[00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:15.394]  And if you realize that and understand that it's scientific, they have a woman on high-def TV looking at you
[00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:27.157]  Trained, batting the eyes, looking like they are opening to you, looking like they are totally into you.
[00:12:27.157 --> 00:12:30.278]  It's like a snake hypnotizes a bird.
[00:12:30.278 --> 00:12:42.282]  And I catch myself, consciously, while I'm jogging, watching it, and the woman is making the sexual desire signals, and I catch myself smiling back at them.
[00:12:42.282 --> 00:12:45.203]  And I'll guarantee you, you catch yourself doing it too.
[00:12:47.662 --> 00:12:56.287]  And then I watch the flirtation moves of men at women with the men they have on the shows.
[00:12:56.287 --> 00:12:57.727]  It's a fashion show.
[00:12:57.727 --> 00:13:02.270]  You've seen how a fashion model walks out and the way she looks at you sexually with desire.
[00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.512]  You ever watch the fashion models Victoria's Secret runway show before the Super Bowl or whatever?
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.542]  And how it's a confident look of sexual power and desire?
[00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.684]  Well, they've gone a level closer to like doe-eyed.
[00:13:15.684 --> 00:13:16.984]  Just take me!
[00:13:16.984 --> 00:13:18.085]  Ravage me!
[00:13:18.085 --> 00:13:18.685]  I'm here!
[00:13:18.685 --> 00:13:24.628]  I mean, do you like scientifically being hit by hardcore Pentagon savagery?
[00:13:24.628 --> 00:13:26.990]  I mean, do you like being hit hard by mind control?
[00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.130]  Do you think it's cute?
[00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.971]  Do you think it's funny?
[00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:43.395]  You like your kids being conditioned with violent video games, which the Pentagon admits they funded and designed, which are the exact same cockpit controls now of the Grim Reaper and the Predators and all the rest of them.
[00:13:43.395 --> 00:13:58.582]  As the entire military says, in the next six years they're going to convert to combat mechs on the ground, swords, new generations of killer droids, drone aircraft, hover drones, smart dirt, everything else.
[00:14:00.697 --> 00:14:03.779]  Tailor-made, race-specific bioweapons for each individual.
[00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:16.307]  That's why the Feds, by hook or by crook, globally are taking blood at checkpoints and tissue swabs, and they admit the new biometrics to fly or have a job is gonna be DNA.
[00:14:16.307 --> 00:14:20.930]  You keep asking what your money, what the new global currency's gonna look like.
[00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:28.695]  And I know in 1988, Money Magazine called it the Global Phoenix and said we'd have an Amaro, and that was being looked at then, but that was all a distraction.
[00:14:29.534 --> 00:14:36.580]  You're gonna have regional currencies controlled by a global bank, and you're gonna access it with your DNA scan.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:41.263]  It's gonna scan, with an electron microscope, your hand.
[00:14:41.263 --> 00:14:42.564]  This is openly announced.
[00:14:42.564 --> 00:14:48.169]  AP, Reuters, Fox News, IBM builds barcode reader for DNA.
[00:14:48.169 --> 00:14:49.850]  Instant!
[00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.153]  The human genome run by IBM at Cold Springs Harbor.
[00:14:53.153 --> 00:14:56.676]  If you don't know what Cold Springs Harbor is, you better go to Encyclopedia Britannica,
[00:14:57.529 --> 00:15:00.418]  And then get ready to cry yourself to sleep at night.
[00:15:00.418 --> 00:15:03.688]  Everything there is about how to kill you and your family deader than a hammer.
[00:15:09.298 --> 00:15:33.475]  You notice they're turning up the ambient background noise of death, of diabetes, and cancer, and autism, and, oh yeah, half the kids are gonna be mentally retarded now, and oh, everybody gets cancer at 25 now, and oh yeah, everybody gets diabetes now, and everybody gets kidney failure.
[00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:38.679]  As the standard of living drops worldwide, and as the life expectancy drops worldwide, it's dropping worldwide.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.501]  They cook the numbers with infant mortality.
[00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:46.884]  They'll bring in 1920s numbers and cook them because more babies died back then.
[00:15:46.884 --> 00:15:49.946]  But if you live past the age of five, you live longer.
[00:15:49.946 --> 00:15:55.490]  On average, 11 years longer now.
[00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.051]  Ever been to an old graveyard?
[00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:58.492]  Half of them are kids under five.
[00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:03.457]  The point is, we're all under chemical attack.
[00:16:03.457 --> 00:16:05.439]  They admit they're chemtrailing us now.
[00:16:05.439 --> 00:16:07.681]  They admit they're poisoning the vaccines.
[00:16:07.681 --> 00:16:10.363]  The UN has been caught doing it all over the world.
[00:16:10.363 --> 00:16:21.272]  They've been caught in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and the Middle East, putting live polio in the shots, on purpose, and infecting everyone with it.
[00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.313]  And it's confirmed!
[00:16:22.313 --> 00:16:25.976]  They just come out and admit it in the Associated Press.
[00:16:25.976 --> 00:16:27.077]  They're sickos!
[00:16:28.271 --> 00:16:31.315]  They just throw it in your face and they make it into a fashion statement.
[00:16:31.315 --> 00:16:32.496]  They make it fun.
[00:16:32.496 --> 00:16:33.537]  They make it cool.
[00:16:33.537 --> 00:16:35.059]  They make it neat.
[00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:41.867]  Oh, you know, Brett Favre was wearing pink shoes for his wife who survived breast cancer and, you know, at 30-something.
[00:16:43.177 --> 00:16:44.477]  And, oh, this woman!
[00:16:44.477 --> 00:16:46.658]  And, oh, the toddler next door is dying of cancer!
[00:16:46.658 --> 00:16:48.518]  Oh, yeah, the kid next door is, too!
[00:16:48.518 --> 00:16:49.759]  Oh, really?
[00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:57.701]  I mean, I have multiple people in my office whose girlfriends are dead or dying of cancer at, like, 24, 25 years old in two different cases.
[00:16:57.701 --> 00:17:00.362]  One of them, 30-something years old, just died of cancer.
[00:17:00.362 --> 00:17:04.223]  One of my... Rob Dew's bandmate, he's known for 10 years.
[00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.943]  A health food nut, you name it.
[00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:07.724]  But she took the vaccines, folks.
[00:17:07.724 --> 00:17:08.804]  She's now dead.
[00:17:11.024 --> 00:17:14.927]  You look around you folks, people are dropping left and right and this is just the ambient background.
[00:17:14.927 --> 00:17:16.629]  Killing us, killing us, killing us.
[00:17:16.629 --> 00:17:28.879]  And the cops will die and they'll love the government and the good old boys will die and they'll love the government and they'll have little marathons for the cure run by the big medical institutions that are run by psycho-murdering eugenicists.
[00:17:28.879 --> 00:17:29.400]  Period!
[00:17:32.321 --> 00:17:37.423]  And if you don't know what eugenics are, you better get it straight real fast.
[00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:41.924]  Hitler learned everything he did from the United States and England.
[00:17:41.924 --> 00:17:46.005]  The United States went further than Hitler up until World War II.
[00:17:46.005 --> 00:17:49.907]  You think Hitler's the only one that euthanized retarded children?
[00:17:49.907 --> 00:17:56.389]  You think Hitler's the only one that killed people in institutions and sterilized and forced abortions and killed babies of poor people?
[00:17:56.389 --> 00:17:58.409]  He got it all from the U.S.
[00:17:58.409 --> 00:17:59.970]  and that was in the Nuremberg defense.
[00:18:00.988 --> 00:18:02.029]  At Nuremberg!
[00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:08.215]  It's in the trial transcript!
[00:18:08.215 --> 00:18:11.598]  You think these control freak a rich elitist?
[00:18:11.598 --> 00:18:14.501]  They hate your guts when they go to public places and see you.
[00:18:14.501 --> 00:18:16.844]  They hate your guts watching you living in nice houses.
[00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:25.535]  And admittedly, society's always been trashy and always had problems, but they've done everything they can to make us more dumb, more trashy.
[00:18:25.535 --> 00:18:35.841]  And hey, I talk to yuppies, they go, yeah, you know, you go to a water park or you go to the gym, you look at all the dumb trash everywhere, you know, maybe it's a good idea to get rid of them.
[00:18:35.841 --> 00:18:40.043]  What you don't understand is the elite actually want to get rid of you, number one.
[00:18:40.043 --> 00:18:46.447]  If you've got a high IQ and you've got the genes they think are powerful, because there is some truth to all of it,
[00:18:48.004 --> 00:18:51.105]  They want you dead, number one.
[00:18:51.105 --> 00:18:53.766]  They want you co-opted or dead.
[00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:55.147]  Do you understand that?
[00:18:55.147 --> 00:18:56.367]  So get that through your head.
[00:18:56.367 --> 00:18:58.208]  That's what I explained to Jesse Ventura.
[00:18:58.208 --> 00:19:04.071]  I was doing this interview with him for his TV show about eugenics, and he's like, yeah, but there are too many people, and we're a parasite, and we're a disease.
[00:19:04.071 --> 00:19:09.213]  And I said, Jesse, how many friends you say you've had lately, even young people you know, dying of brain disorders?
[00:19:09.213 --> 00:19:13.614]  He goes, an awful lot.
[00:19:13.614 --> 00:19:14.475]  And I said, buddy,
[00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.871]  And I said, you got good instincts, but I said, I can give you the documents.
[00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:23.033]  But I said, in your gut, you know they're putting stuff in the water and the vaccines and the food.
[00:19:23.033 --> 00:19:24.133]  And you know things are changing.
[00:19:24.133 --> 00:19:27.174]  You know everybody's sick or getting sick.
[00:19:27.174 --> 00:19:29.935]  And I said, you know this is for you.
[00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:36.318]  It's one thing to make a statement about how there's too many people and you don't want to look at the, you know, dumb trash walking around.
[00:19:36.318 --> 00:19:39.679]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that dumb trash could be lifted up.
[00:19:40.595 --> 00:19:48.579]  You have to try to rise humanity up, not just decide it's trash and that our species isn't special, and decide that every child isn't special.
[00:19:48.579 --> 00:19:50.080]  Every child is special.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.523]  They do have the spark of creativity and innate, dynamic life form.
[00:19:55.523 --> 00:19:59.285]  Humanity is amazing, but we're being pulled down by the control frigs.
[00:20:00.714 --> 00:20:04.096]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:04.096 --> 00:20:07.998]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:11.720]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:19.024]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:22.319]  I think so.
[00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:53.048]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[00:20:53.048 --> 00:20:55.629]  Or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:20:55.629 --> 00:21:01.291]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:02.331]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:21:02.331 --> 00:21:07.853]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:21:07.853 --> 00:21:08.393]  I get it.
[00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:18.017]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:21:18.017 --> 00:21:19.177]  That's not what's happening.
[00:21:19.437 --> 00:21:27.903]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:21:27.903 --> 00:21:31.285]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:21:31.285 --> 00:21:35.568]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:21:35.568 --> 00:21:37.170]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.572]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[00:21:40.572 --> 00:21:44.735]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:45.815]  You should too.
[00:21:45.815 --> 00:21:46.976]  Find out what they know.
[00:21:46.976 --> 00:21:49.897]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:21:49.897 --> 00:21:49.957]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.957 --> 00:21:50.017]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:50.397]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.421]  It's here!
[00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:09.565]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:22:09.565 --> 00:22:17.912]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:22:17.912 --> 00:22:25.358]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:22:25.358 --> 00:22:32.224]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:22:32.737 --> 00:22:37.080]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.042]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:22:41.042 --> 00:22:43.303]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:22:43.303 --> 00:22:47.746]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:24:18.812 --> 00:24:28.100]  It's easy at a primitive level to see the police as like the bad guys and the other team that the people are fighting with.
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:34.706]  Then we have to see the propaganda worshipping them all day and all their corruption is defended and whitewashed.
[00:24:36.038 --> 00:24:42.419]  When in truth, a lot of sadists and control freaks go and get in the uniform so they can carry out their power trip.
[00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:51.041]  But there are a lot of good people as well who take the job because of family or because they're former military and it seems like a good profession.
[00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:53.921]  But none of that matters.
[00:24:53.921 --> 00:24:58.282]  The police are under the very same New World Order attack that the general public is.
[00:24:58.282 --> 00:25:00.302]  So is the average bureaucrat.
[00:25:00.302 --> 00:25:02.543]  They have no idea what's going on.
[00:25:02.543 --> 00:25:04.163]  They're totally compartmentalized.
[00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:09.213]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[00:25:09.213 --> 00:25:35.763]  How do you get the message across to people who think it's about black versus white, or Hispanic versus white, or Hispanic versus black, or Northerner against Southerner, or Montanan against Californian, or Canadian against American, or Brit against the Irish, or Tutsi against Hutu in Rwanda, or Muslim against Christian in Indonesia, when it's not!
[00:25:36.604 --> 00:25:48.333]  You have a criminal ruling class that have made a religion out of understanding how human beings operate and what makes people tick, a religion out of manipulating the population.
[00:25:48.333 --> 00:25:53.017]  A religion out of the elite passing their power on generation after generation.
[00:25:53.017 --> 00:25:53.858]  That's what royalty is.
[00:25:56.101 --> 00:26:14.713]  A religion of self-worship where they believe that they are the chosen ones, and not only will they find the way to dominate the planet through genetic engineering and bioweapons, but they will find the way to extend their lives through the life extension technologies of genetic engineering.
[00:26:14.713 --> 00:26:20.856]  What does Roy Batty say to the head of Tyrell Corporation in Blade Runner?
[00:26:20.856 --> 00:26:23.278]  I want more life.
[00:26:27.008 --> 00:26:34.691]  The facts of life.
[00:26:34.691 --> 00:26:43.834]  And that's what it comes down to, is all of these memories.
[00:26:43.834 --> 00:26:46.995]  Fiery the angels fell.
[00:26:46.995 --> 00:26:51.997]  Deep thunder rolled around their shores, burning with the fires of Ork.
[00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:02.434]  All these memories disappear like tears in the rain.
[00:27:02.434 --> 00:27:15.841]  It isn't vanity, it isn't arrogance, it's just love of the species, love of life, love of knowledge, wanting to communicate, wanting to huddle in the cave with your tribe forever, not wanting to leave your loved ones.
[00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:16.882]  No one wants to die.
[00:27:19.377 --> 00:27:28.385]  But imagine the most selfish, the most cunning, the most wicked, the most sadistic, those that would cut corners, those that would lie, those that would stab in the back, and those who would do it the most convincingly.
[00:27:28.385 --> 00:27:31.428]  They get the birthright of humanity.
[00:27:31.428 --> 00:27:35.652]  They get the great flower of our technology and everything we've built.
[00:27:35.652 --> 00:27:37.794]  We're an amazing species!
[00:27:37.794 --> 00:27:39.655]  We're not parasites!
[00:27:39.655 --> 00:27:44.259]  We're master builders!
[00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:45.460]  We're great engineers!
[00:27:47.233 --> 00:27:50.138]  We are made in the image of God.
[00:27:50.138 --> 00:27:53.403]  We are architects.
[00:27:53.403 --> 00:27:56.588]  And fools will email me and say, oh, Lucifer's the great architect.
[00:27:56.588 --> 00:28:01.236]  No, Lucifer is a counterfeit of the true great architect!
[00:28:04.142 --> 00:28:15.465]  Every sacred symbol that we have that is innate and archetypal, written on our souls by God, has been counterfeited and used and expropriated by the New World Order.
[00:28:15.465 --> 00:28:21.167]  And we are taking those symbols back!
[00:28:21.167 --> 00:28:25.848]  The sun, the moon, the stars, this is the evidence of the creation.
[00:28:25.848 --> 00:28:28.109]  This is the evidence of the incredible
[00:28:29.454 --> 00:28:30.054]  Beauty!
[00:28:30.054 --> 00:28:34.996]  An unbelievable gift of life and consciousness!
[00:28:34.996 --> 00:28:36.577]  I am thankful for it!
[00:28:36.577 --> 00:28:37.977]  I rejoice in it!
[00:28:37.977 --> 00:28:39.598]  I appreciate it!
[00:28:39.598 --> 00:28:47.381]  And all I wanted to do is defend innocence and try to get people to believe in themselves and to build and to not feel inadequate.
[00:28:47.381 --> 00:28:55.964]  Because once Madison Avenue Mind Control makes you feel inadequate and insecure, they can then sell you whatever lies they want.
[00:28:55.964 --> 00:28:57.125]  And they build you
[00:28:58.726 --> 00:28:59.747]  into monsters.
[00:28:59.747 --> 00:29:07.494]  They turn you into biological androids operating off of outside artificial dehumanizing stimulus.
[00:29:07.494 --> 00:29:09.636]  Stimuli!
[00:29:09.636 --> 00:29:10.677]  Come on, folks!
[00:29:10.677 --> 00:29:11.978]  You can figure this out.
[00:29:11.978 --> 00:29:14.881]  You can break out of your conditioning.
[00:29:14.881 --> 00:29:17.003]  You can realize how they're manipulating us.
[00:29:17.003 --> 00:29:19.145]  You can understand their master plan.
[00:29:19.145 --> 00:29:20.146]  We can defeat them!
[00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:30.648]  Well, we've got to break out of their matrix of false left-right and all these issues and realize anything that centralizes power is bad, they will use it and abuse it.
[00:29:30.648 --> 00:29:33.930]  Anything that gives them control over the family is bad.
[00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.171]  So, look, it's simple.
[00:29:35.171 --> 00:29:36.392]  You end big government.
[00:29:36.392 --> 00:29:37.833]  You cut off dependency.
[00:29:37.833 --> 00:29:46.840]  You realize they're using heart strings that they pull on us to sell us on big government, when that big government's there to kill you, Duttard and Hammer, or use you as slaves.
[00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:48.340]  You understand?
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.026]  We're gonna come back in to the death of the dollar.
[00:29:51.026 --> 00:29:52.429]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.429 --> 00:29:54.032]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.032 --> 00:29:57.659]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:03.884]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.884 --> 00:30:09.227]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.227 --> 00:30:11.268]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.268 --> 00:30:16.271]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:17.451]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.451 --> 00:30:18.572]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.572 --> 00:30:20.473]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.473 --> 00:30:21.534]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.534 --> 00:30:23.555]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.735 --> 00:30:25.077]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.077 --> 00:30:26.599]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:31.866]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.866 --> 00:30:35.450]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.935]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.275 --> 00:30:40.496]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.496 --> 00:30:41.396]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.396 --> 00:30:42.497]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.497 --> 00:30:43.437]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.437 --> 00:30:44.518]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.518 --> 00:30:47.580]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.361]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:50.261]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:06.865]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:13.849]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.443 --> 00:31:21.026]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.026 --> 00:31:23.006]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.006 --> 00:31:25.507]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.507 --> 00:31:36.472]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.072 --> 00:31:38.754]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.754 --> 00:31:40.616]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.616 --> 00:31:47.524]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.524 --> 00:31:55.793]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.793 --> 00:31:57.374]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.374 --> 00:31:58.556]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:06.078]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[00:32:06.078 --> 00:32:09.579]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[00:32:09.579 --> 00:32:15.301]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[00:32:15.301 --> 00:32:17.862]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[00:32:17.862 --> 00:32:22.403]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[00:32:22.403 --> 00:32:25.124]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[00:32:25.584 --> 00:32:31.310]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.572]  That's NoGerms.info.
[00:32:33.572 --> 00:32:42.121]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[00:32:42.121 --> 00:32:43.122]  Don't pick your nose.
[00:32:43.482 --> 00:32:48.065]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[00:32:48.065 --> 00:32:53.189]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[00:32:53.189 --> 00:32:54.930]  Go to no germs dot info.
[00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.152]  That's no germs dot info.
[00:32:57.152 --> 00:32:58.873]  Be well and stay well.
[00:32:58.873 --> 00:32:59.614]  Best MZ.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.093]  The Global Controllers, they look at the stars.
[00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:20.853]  They want to colonize them with their families, with their genetics, their control fees.
[00:33:20.853 --> 00:33:42.226]  They look at all the genetic engineering, the technology they developed over a hundred years ago, that they began to research, that they obsessed over, that they funded at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany, and the big Royal Academies in England, and the Cold Springs Harbor where IBM ran its eugenics operations from day one under the Nazi Thomas Watson.
[00:33:46.718 --> 00:33:51.640]  This is their system, and they've always had this plan, and they see you as dumb animals.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.282]  And their comment is, look at them.
[00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:57.783]  They take the shots, even though we tell them in the inserts it's going to hurt them.
[00:33:57.783 --> 00:34:02.726]  And look at them.
[00:34:02.726 --> 00:34:09.089]  They follow along with all our propaganda, and so that means that if they're able to be manipulated, that it's our right to do it to them.
[00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.970]  They believe in social Darwinism.
[00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:13.217]  That Mike makes right.
[00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:19.262]  That they're doing the world a favor by dumbing you down and getting rid of you.
[00:34:19.262 --> 00:34:29.349]  And so you can keep sucking your thumb and thinking, Barack Obama's gonna get me, or George Bush is gonna get me, or John McCain's gonna get me, or he's gonna save me.
[00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:32.031]  Those guys are front men.
[00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:34.753]  And while you're busy worrying about them,
[00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:38.189]  It's like a lot of Las Vegas casinos.
[00:34:38.189 --> 00:34:42.553]  They'll have some casino director who's for the public face.
[00:34:42.553 --> 00:34:45.997]  But then behind it, you know, it's the mobsters that really own it.
[00:34:45.997 --> 00:34:52.103]  It's the same elementary system of the power behind the throne.
[00:34:52.103 --> 00:34:59.591]  And you don't trust your neighbors, and you don't trust people in business, and rightfully so, but then you totally trust the government?
[00:35:00.711 --> 00:35:09.435]  Which is the most elite, most wicked, most vicious people in history that have proven themselves willing to be completely ruthless.
[00:35:09.435 --> 00:35:16.978]  Not just willing, they enjoy it!
[00:35:16.978 --> 00:35:19.599]  They enjoy what they're doing to you.
[00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:22.540]  Let me just mention, David Icke's coming up in 25 minutes.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.561]  Then we got Max Keiser and then Alan Watt.
[00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:26.982]  That is gonna be informative today.
[00:35:26.982 --> 00:35:30.303]  Max Keiser on the dollar degenerating into hell.
[00:35:32.824 --> 00:35:34.784]  And then I've got all this other insane news.
[00:35:34.784 --> 00:35:54.388]  I've got John Elway, the former Super Bowl QB, in a disgusting Colorado version of the MIAC report, but this is a public DHS slash MIAC for the public.
[00:35:54.388 --> 00:36:00.809]  This is made public for the general population to watch, and it says if you're in somebody's garage or house and you see guns,
[00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:04.954]  Call the police on them, they're terrorists.
[00:36:04.954 --> 00:36:07.095]  And why do you think people like J.T.
[00:36:07.095 --> 00:36:16.339]  Cote and others have been on this show, and it was admitted in the local news, people are in your garage or in your house, they see reloading.
[00:36:16.339 --> 00:36:24.462]  I mean, I see reports every day or two, and I'm not looking for them, in Michigan and in Massachusetts and in Texas and in everywhere.
[00:36:24.462 --> 00:36:31.685]  But I've seen a lot of cases in Colorado where the carpet cleaner, the Century 21 person, the cable guy,
[00:36:32.938 --> 00:36:37.421]  They will see a gun case and they call the cops on you.
[00:36:37.421 --> 00:36:41.903]  They will see reloading and call thinking you're Al-Qaeda and that's in this video.
[00:36:41.903 --> 00:36:52.609]  It says, even if you see guns, it says, it's just so sick.
[00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:59.553]  And it shows somebody creeping around in the airport trying to take a picture with their iPhone of the security checkpoint.
[00:36:59.553 --> 00:37:01.455]  Well, I just did that the other day right in front of them.
[00:37:01.455 --> 00:37:02.055]  It's interesting.
[00:37:03.911 --> 00:37:08.013]  I wanted to show the thugs searching an old lady.
[00:37:08.013 --> 00:37:14.457]  But the point is, is that they say if you're at a national park taking photos, you're a terrorist.
[00:37:14.457 --> 00:37:16.258]  And it tells citizens to tattle on you.
[00:37:16.258 --> 00:37:25.764]  Now, when you go to these... I wonder if John Elway knows that when you go to one of the actual little training terror seminars, they have these TV ads they run.
[00:37:25.764 --> 00:37:30.186]  They have a terror museum in Denver, it was saying.
[00:37:30.186 --> 00:37:30.967]  All about Al Qaeda.
[00:37:33.749 --> 00:37:45.875]  And you just look at the frat boy arrogance and the wannabe dominance and just, just, just, just the look on his face when he's doing this, the worship of the police state and the worship of spying on your neighbors.
[00:37:45.875 --> 00:37:47.636]  And I tell you, it just made me sick.
[00:37:47.636 --> 00:37:54.959]  I don't ever want to, I already saw him in a Shriner's ad where he's acting real punk-like with Timberlake to each other and they're being real rude to each other.
[00:37:54.959 --> 00:37:58.000]  And it was just real, had mind control written all over it.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.261]  I didn't like him when I saw that.
[00:37:59.261 --> 00:38:00.782]  And now I see this and it's just like, ugh.
[00:38:04.226 --> 00:38:07.227]  But again, the cops just love it, the citizens just love it.
[00:38:07.227 --> 00:38:08.867]  Hey, it's John Elway!
[00:38:08.867 --> 00:38:18.529]  He says, is my neighbor taking photos of stuff?
[00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:25.110]  It's amazing, and it says if you see anybody trespassing in a field, call the police on them, they're probably terrorists.
[00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:28.591]  So now, people call the cops on you when you're even in your own field if they don't know you.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:37.026]  In rural areas of Texas now, if you try to walk from one of your pieces of property to the other on the highway, cops will stop and ask why you have a shotgun.
[00:38:37.026 --> 00:38:55.320]  Well, uh, jackass, uh, I'm out here, uh, walking from one dove field to the next, and listen, my uncle, no criminal record, literally Dudley Do-Right, worships the police.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.701]  One of several uncles I have.
[00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:57.362]  My dad's brother.
[00:38:58.843 --> 00:39:27.460]  He was driving, with the tags on it, a buck that my Uncle Leonard, who's really bad off with pancreatic cancer right now, and this is about a year ago, probably the last time he'll go deer hunting, and he said he was real sick, and he said, I don't want to have to drive into town to the processor, because they usually gut it themselves, cut into steaks, but he wanted it made into sausage and stuff, so they gutted it, but didn't chop it all up, and he was going to drive it into Fairfield,
[00:39:28.328 --> 00:39:37.431]  Which, again, my family, founders of the town, you know, in the Freestone County Historical Society, in the book they put out.
[00:39:37.431 --> 00:39:42.872]  Founders of it, the Browns, the Johnsons, the Joneses.
[00:39:42.872 --> 00:39:45.233]  Been there since the early 1830s.
[00:39:45.233 --> 00:39:46.433]  Mexican land grants.
[00:39:46.433 --> 00:39:47.913]  It doesn't matter!
[00:39:47.913 --> 00:39:56.276]  They pull my uncle over, Highway Patrol, get him out, shove him up against the car, tell him he's a criminal,
[00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.971]  They don't care if there's a tag.
[00:39:58.971 --> 00:39:59.731]  They don't care.
[00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:01.613]  And he says, you're going to prison.
[00:40:01.613 --> 00:40:03.734]  You're not allowed to drive somebody else's deer.
[00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:07.496]  Now, my uncle, he literally worships red tape.
[00:40:07.496 --> 00:40:10.337]  He's a good guy, but I mean, he can, he's into it.
[00:40:10.337 --> 00:40:16.841]  He said, actually, such and such, such and such says the landowner can drive the venison to a facility.
[00:40:16.841 --> 00:40:18.562]  The guy didn't care.
[00:40:18.562 --> 00:40:19.783]  The sheriff had to get there.
[00:40:21.127 --> 00:40:28.971]  Sheriff's Department, and of course my grandfather was the tax assessor and a bunch of other stuff there, and so they backed off, and the state policeman didn't apologize, he drove off.
[00:40:28.971 --> 00:40:30.132]  He had a slave!
[00:40:30.132 --> 00:40:31.473]  He had a scum!
[00:40:31.473 --> 00:40:35.535]  He had his quarry, his buck!
[00:40:35.535 --> 00:40:40.097]  Because he wanted to seize the rifles and that truck.
[00:40:40.097 --> 00:40:41.558]  They're predators!
[00:40:41.558 --> 00:40:43.339]  And that's all they exist for!
[00:40:43.339 --> 00:40:48.082]  Let me tell you, when I was a little kid, every once in a while, game warden would pull up.
[00:40:49.758 --> 00:40:54.220]  We would be out front looking at the stars.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.541]  And a game warden would pull up, shine lights in your eyes, and say, are you deer hunting?
[00:40:57.541 --> 00:41:01.502]  No, we're not on the king's precious land deer hunting in the, you know, we're out here looking.
[00:41:01.502 --> 00:41:03.663]  See, it's abnormal to be outside your house.
[00:41:03.663 --> 00:41:04.623]  But they weren't really rude.
[00:41:04.623 --> 00:41:06.424]  Now they're rude.
[00:41:06.424 --> 00:41:10.945]  They show up, they're rude because you're scum, you're filth in America.
[00:41:10.945 --> 00:41:19.148]  Just like $100,000 fines for selling any of over 100,000 recalled products in the last 10 years, over 10,000 recalled a year.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:20.900]  No one knows.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:25.343]  You got it at a bazaar, or a flea market, or a garage sale.
[00:41:25.343 --> 00:41:27.004]  It's felony charges.
[00:41:27.004 --> 00:41:27.504]  A $100,000 fine.
[00:41:27.504 --> 00:41:30.005]  And they're taking people to jail.
[00:41:30.005 --> 00:41:31.466]  They're federalizing.
[00:41:31.466 --> 00:41:33.867]  You're Amish, you sell some eggs, you're going to get SWAT teamed.
[00:41:33.867 --> 00:41:37.669]  You sell some watermelons, you sell some squash, you sell some peaches, you sell some pecans.
[00:41:37.669 --> 00:41:38.330]  It's over.
[00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.031]  All over the country.
[00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:41.552]  You want to...
[00:41:43.607 --> 00:41:51.451]  Have two of your neighbor kids, your good friends with your neighbors, you want to have them come in when it's freezing cold and below zero in Michigan while they're waiting on the bus for 30 minutes?
[00:41:51.451 --> 00:41:51.931]  No!
[00:41:51.931 --> 00:41:54.833]  You will be arrested!
[00:41:54.833 --> 00:41:59.735]  A father at a game who doesn't even drink.
[00:41:59.735 --> 00:42:00.756]  This came out in the news.
[00:42:00.756 --> 00:42:02.236]  Top archaeologist in Michigan.
[00:42:02.236 --> 00:42:03.457]  Remember this last year we had him on?
[00:42:05.782 --> 00:42:07.602]  He said, two lemonades, please.
[00:42:07.602 --> 00:42:10.223]  The moron brought him hard lemonade.
[00:42:10.223 --> 00:42:15.804]  And by the way, the reason I know this, my parents had a party a few years ago, and they bought hard lemonade.
[00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:18.705]  It was an adult party, but still, it just looks like lemon.
[00:42:18.705 --> 00:42:19.425]  It says hard lemon.
[00:42:19.425 --> 00:42:21.245]  Oh, that must be a strong lemon flavor.
[00:42:21.245 --> 00:42:22.005]  I popped it.
[00:42:22.005 --> 00:42:22.566]  Ew, vodka.
[00:42:22.566 --> 00:42:23.566]  I don't want that.
[00:42:23.566 --> 00:42:24.866]  Same thing.
[00:42:24.866 --> 00:42:31.627]  The person almost, I guess, getting a cut, like a trap, this was admitted, brought him the lemonade, watched, they popped it.
[00:42:31.627 --> 00:42:32.548]  He didn't drink it first.
[00:42:32.548 --> 00:42:33.908]  The kid took what, one drink?
[00:42:34.758 --> 00:42:36.399]  They sent it back.
[00:42:36.399 --> 00:42:37.279]  They didn't care.
[00:42:37.279 --> 00:42:38.039]  He was arrested.
[00:42:38.039 --> 00:42:39.920]  CPS took the kid.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.160]  They took blood from the kid.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:41.880]  All freaked out.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.282]  He had no blood alcohol level.
[00:42:45.282 --> 00:42:46.162]  That's America.
[00:42:46.162 --> 00:42:47.722]  Just everybody ready.
[00:42:47.722 --> 00:42:48.823]  Everybody watching.
[00:42:48.823 --> 00:42:52.004]  Everybody wanting the pat on the head from the man in the uniform.
[00:42:55.356 --> 00:43:07.626]  And so it doesn't matter if my uncle Joe Lynn Jones wants to drive the damn deer in for his uncle that's fighting to live for cancer in his last time probably deer hunting.
[00:43:07.626 --> 00:43:09.747]  It doesn't matter in America!
[00:43:09.747 --> 00:43:11.829]  You're not gonna babysit!
[00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:13.551]  And you're not gonna deer hunt!
[00:43:13.551 --> 00:43:15.592]  And you're not gonna have garage sales!
[00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:17.574]  And you're not gonna sell watermelons!
[00:43:17.574 --> 00:43:18.574]  You got that?
[00:43:18.574 --> 00:43:19.836]  You're prisoners!
[00:43:19.836 --> 00:43:21.937]  Owned by the cops we worship!
[00:43:21.937 --> 00:43:22.538]  Period!
[00:43:24.758 --> 00:43:36.497]  And the foreign banks are going to steal everything we got, and that son of a bitch, John Elway, excuse me, is going to sit up there with an arrogant, predatory, cop-worshiping look in his eyes.
[00:43:36.497 --> 00:43:37.859]  In fact, get the video clip ready.
[00:43:38.956 --> 00:43:40.817]  Get it ready, I'm gonna play it later.
[00:43:40.817 --> 00:43:44.060]  Here's the audio of John Elway, and it sounds oh so readable.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:49.544]  Listen, firearms, if you're in somebody's house or garage, and you see firearms, it shows somebody's house.
[00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:57.669]  And I've already, ten years ago, had the carpet cleaning place try to call the cops on me for a shotgun in a gun case!
[00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:08.418]  Because the idiots that come to your house think everything is based on TV, and NYPD Blue, they arrest people on the imaginary show who got guns.
[00:44:08.418 --> 00:44:15.663]  Because it's based in New York, where the slaves are disarmed, just like Chicago.
[00:44:15.663 --> 00:44:21.708]  Oh, I've got all the Homeland Security training manuals, it's all about gun owners, and they're training the public, your guns are illegal!
[00:44:23.183 --> 00:44:25.324]  They're trying to tell them you can't sell watermelons!
[00:44:25.324 --> 00:44:30.488]  They're trying to tell them that you can't let the kids stand under your porch!
[00:44:30.488 --> 00:44:31.188]  You understand?
[00:44:31.188 --> 00:44:35.711]  I'm not your prisoner, you criminal, blood-sucking, parasite government!
[00:44:35.711 --> 00:44:38.893]  I've had it with your crap!
[00:44:38.893 --> 00:44:48.059]  By the way, they only had the big government phase while they were busy sucking all the money off everybody and getting the police state set up.
[00:44:48.059 --> 00:44:50.901]  They're gonna cut all the government... I watched this CNN piece today.
[00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:59.074]  And it said, should we pay for illegal aliens healthcare or should they just die?
[00:44:59.074 --> 00:45:02.416]  And they cut to this guy going, he's going to be dead if he doesn't get dialysis.
[00:45:02.416 --> 00:45:05.138]  And they admitted he's getting dialysis.
[00:45:05.138 --> 00:45:10.601]  But they spun it and lied and said, oh well this day, because he didn't bring his paperwork, he got turned away from the new clinic.
[00:45:10.601 --> 00:45:12.883]  Folks, illegal aliens get free healthcare everywhere.
[00:45:12.883 --> 00:45:13.863]  Everybody gets free healthcare.
[00:45:13.863 --> 00:45:14.544]  It's called charity.
[00:45:14.544 --> 00:45:15.905]  It's called law.
[00:45:15.905 --> 00:45:18.806]  Hospitals are supposed to give a third of their care in charity.
[00:45:18.806 --> 00:45:19.707]  It was all a lie.
[00:45:24.104 --> 00:45:26.004]  We've had medical doctors on to explain it to you.
[00:45:26.004 --> 00:45:27.285]  It's all a lie.
[00:45:27.285 --> 00:45:30.826]  They just don't teach you, the citizens, how to get the free health care.
[00:45:30.826 --> 00:45:33.766]  Now, we got 40 million uninsured in this country.
[00:45:33.766 --> 00:45:35.967]  The insurance companies are corrupt.
[00:45:35.967 --> 00:45:38.428]  They're lobbying for the government takeover of health care.
[00:45:38.428 --> 00:45:41.669]  Just like the oil companies are lobbying for the global carbon tax.
[00:45:41.669 --> 00:45:43.269]  It's the opposite of what you're told on the news.
[00:45:45.404 --> 00:45:48.328]  And they show the illegal alien, and they say there's 7 million here.
[00:45:48.328 --> 00:45:48.869]  There's more like 30.
[00:45:48.869 --> 00:45:51.332]  The government admits 14 to 16.
[00:45:51.332 --> 00:45:53.434]  CNN lies.
[00:45:53.434 --> 00:45:55.517]  And they say, well, he'll just be dead in three months then.
[00:45:55.517 --> 00:45:56.679]  No dialysis for him.
[00:45:56.679 --> 00:45:59.462]  Yeah, he's an illegal alien, been here for 10 years.
[00:46:00.575 --> 00:46:02.836]  They said, oh, they gave him a free ticket back to Mexico.
[00:46:02.836 --> 00:46:04.656]  He admitted, oh, I won't get healthcare in Mexico.
[00:46:04.656 --> 00:46:09.197]  You think anybody, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, purple, green, can go to Mexico and get that?
[00:46:09.197 --> 00:46:10.257]  No.
[00:46:10.257 --> 00:46:13.438]  There's 500 million people south of the border.
[00:46:13.438 --> 00:46:14.758]  109 million in Mexico alone.
[00:46:14.758 --> 00:46:15.839]  I checked the census yesterday.
[00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.739]  420-something million in North America.
[00:46:17.739 --> 00:46:18.939]  But 500 million in Latin America plus.
[00:46:25.011 --> 00:46:26.792]  That all want to come here for free health care.
[00:46:26.792 --> 00:46:28.892]  It isn't free, the bankers love it!
[00:46:28.892 --> 00:46:32.054]  They just run the country deeper in debt.
[00:46:32.054 --> 00:46:35.595]  The $23.7 trillion we gave to banks was loaned back to us in interest.
[00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:38.336]  That's why they doubled your credit card rate to 30%.
[00:46:38.336 --> 00:46:41.657]  And the federal law doesn't stop that, like they keep saying, oh that's just for now.
[00:46:41.657 --> 00:46:45.338]  It just says they gotta tell you how they're raping you at the top of the statement.
[00:46:45.338 --> 00:46:51.901]  You paid tax money to the banks and credit card companies so they could double to loan sharking rates of 30%.
[00:46:54.605 --> 00:47:00.368]  They're going to bankrupt everything and it's going to be just like Mexico, where everybody's living in shacks.
[00:47:00.368 --> 00:47:01.929]  But it was like, will he die?
[00:47:01.929 --> 00:47:04.310]  Oh, we better give amnesty to him.
[00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:07.812]  All baloney.
[00:47:07.812 --> 00:47:09.453]  They're hitting a free ride for everybody.
[00:47:09.453 --> 00:47:15.836]  The bankers are just bankrupting us right now.
[00:47:15.836 --> 00:47:17.337]  I'm going to play the John Elway thing.
[00:47:19.051 --> 00:47:25.453]  Later, when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, David Icke's coming up in about 12 minutes, 12 and a half minutes, but let's just get him onto the start of the hour.
[00:47:25.453 --> 00:47:29.534]  We're going live at 12 noon sharp, Central Standard Time at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:29.534 --> 00:47:32.934]  We're live on the radio right now.
[00:47:32.934 --> 00:47:37.595]  It's just, if you don't know what real tyranny is, folks, you're living on another planet.
[00:47:37.595 --> 00:47:39.316]  Okay?
[00:47:39.316 --> 00:47:41.997]  I mean, this is real, and it's sick, and it's dangerous.
[00:47:41.997 --> 00:47:46.898]  Now, that said, dollar tumbles on report of its demise.
[00:47:46.898 --> 00:47:47.758]  That's the Independent.
[00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:56.009]  You search the term dollar under news, you'll get thousands of new articles a day, and everyone says the dollar's dead.
[00:47:56.009 --> 00:47:58.371]  I don't believe that's the case.
[00:47:58.371 --> 00:47:59.731]  It's like a basketball.
[00:47:59.731 --> 00:48:10.477]  It's gonna bounce a few more times, or a dead cat bounce, but it's gonna continue to lose value, and gold's gonna continue to go up and down, but overall in the trend, straight up.
[00:48:10.477 --> 00:48:11.778]  And the stock market's gonna go up.
[00:48:11.778 --> 00:48:12.218]  You know why?
[00:48:12.218 --> 00:48:14.499]  Because you're buying those stocks with devalued dollars, don't you?
[00:48:14.499 --> 00:48:15.640]  That's why gold's going up.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.301]  The stock market didn't go up, gold didn't go up,
[00:48:19.892 --> 00:48:20.972]  The dollar went down!
[00:48:20.972 --> 00:48:23.473]  Comprende?
[00:48:23.473 --> 00:48:23.993]  You got it?
[00:48:23.993 --> 00:48:25.574]  You can comprehend it?
[00:48:25.574 --> 00:48:33.556]  All you yuppies out there think you know everything?
[00:48:33.556 --> 00:48:36.677]  And, uh... Well, let's bring Ted Anderson up.
[00:48:36.677 --> 00:48:38.657]  Ted, I haven't looked in the last hour.
[00:48:38.657 --> 00:48:40.098]  Last time I checked, gold was, uh...
[00:48:41.294 --> 00:48:43.155]  I know I went to a high today of $1,048.24.
[00:48:43.155 --> 00:48:44.435]  What is it right now?
[00:48:44.435 --> 00:48:46.556]  Last time I looked, Alex, it was $1,041.70.
[00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:49.257]  It hit a high in the trading market here in the United States at $1,045.50.
[00:48:49.257 --> 00:48:51.677]  It hit that $1,048, best I can tell, in the Asian market.
[00:48:51.677 --> 00:48:53.038]  Well, Wall Street Journal says $1,046.80.
[00:49:10.148 --> 00:49:12.209]  And then I've got another one here.
[00:49:12.209 --> 00:49:13.670]  I'm confused why they all say different numbers.
[00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:15.552]  Here's AFP.
[00:49:15.552 --> 00:49:18.253]  In commodity trading, gold struck another record high of $1,048.43.
[00:49:18.253 --> 00:49:21.716]  So, whatever.
[00:49:21.716 --> 00:49:23.917]  It's very high.
[00:49:23.917 --> 00:49:24.898]  Right?
[00:49:24.898 --> 00:49:25.398]  Yeah, it is.
[00:49:25.398 --> 00:49:26.579]  It's high.
[00:49:26.579 --> 00:49:32.102]  And you've got to remember, a lot of the services out there only measure what's going on in the New York Commodities Exchange.
[00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:32.903]  It's called the COMEX.
[00:49:33.932 --> 00:49:37.517]  But that doesn't mean that that's the only commodities exchange in the world.
[00:49:37.517 --> 00:49:45.406]  As soon as ours closes in the evening, the London Exchange is open, so is the Tokyo Exchange, and so on and so forth.
[00:49:45.406 --> 00:49:47.228]  You'll see the Asian markets going up.
[00:49:47.228 --> 00:49:50.332]  You know, that's where most of the bull market is coming from right now.
[00:49:50.772 --> 00:49:57.137]  The United States market tries to suppress gold and bring it back down, and the Asian market just pushes it right back up.
[00:49:57.137 --> 00:49:58.058]  And we can see that.
[00:49:58.058 --> 00:50:03.142]  We see in the trend, even on the daily charts, it hammers down, hammers up, hammers down, hammers up.
[00:50:03.142 --> 00:50:07.545]  From the analysts I've read over the years, they're saying that's a surefire sign of manipulation.
[00:50:07.545 --> 00:50:17.333]  Well, the funny thing is, Alex, that article came out in The Independent talking about the Arabs having a secret meeting with Russia, and also with Russia and
[00:50:18.654 --> 00:50:20.395]  I just can't remember all the nations that were in those.
[00:50:20.395 --> 00:50:21.015]  China.
[00:50:21.015 --> 00:50:22.835]  Tarpoli said that was happening a month ago.
[00:50:22.835 --> 00:50:23.976]  He talked about that.
[00:50:23.976 --> 00:50:24.836]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:24.836 --> 00:50:28.677]  But now, there was a big cover-up story that came out here just right after that.
[00:50:28.677 --> 00:50:35.199]  So now, they're trying to control the media to tell us, oh no, this meeting really didn't happen.
[00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:38.200]  But the truth of the matter is, the market's saying it did happen.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:38.700]  You know, though...
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.401]  None of that matters.
[00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:41.763]  Our whole future being destroyed.
[00:50:41.763 --> 00:50:43.025]  The dollar imploding.
[00:50:43.025 --> 00:50:44.106]  That doesn't matter.
[00:50:44.106 --> 00:50:50.895]  What matters is I talk bad about John Elway because he said we need to come in our houses and basically confiscate our guns, that we're terrorists, that we own guns.
[00:50:50.895 --> 00:50:55.020]  See, I should give my Second Amendment up because John Elway says it's bad.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:55.501]  Stay there, Ted.
[00:50:55.501 --> 00:50:57.604]  Let's talk about what it means to have the dollar dying.

[00:52:00.816 --> 00:52:07.559]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.559 --> 00:52:10.201]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.201 --> 00:52:11.762]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.762 --> 00:52:12.562]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:13.502]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:13.502 --> 00:52:14.923]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:16.904]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.904 --> 00:52:24.068]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.068 --> 00:52:24.548]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.548 --> 00:52:30.231]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:34.394]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.394 --> 00:52:37.197]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.839 --> 00:53:02.400]  Are you constantly tired?
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.261]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[00:53:04.261 --> 00:53:07.543]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[00:53:07.543 --> 00:53:10.565]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[00:54:13.762 --> 00:54:15.825]  David Ickes coming up.
[00:54:15.825 --> 00:54:18.068]  Then Max Keiser on what's happening with the dollar.
[00:54:18.068 --> 00:54:20.130]  Excellent analysis of someone rushing today.
[00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:25.196]  And we've got Alan Watt as well.
[00:54:25.196 --> 00:54:28.480]  So very, very informative information coming up.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.163]  Ted, I'm going to be talking with
[00:54:31.431 --> 00:54:39.297]  Max Keiser about this, and also somebody's been talking about it for more than a decade, how they plan to kill currencies to bring in this world government currency.
[00:54:39.297 --> 00:54:46.482]  The SDRs, you're still going to have regional currencies, they're just going to be trash, and the banks will have their bank-to-bank lending.
[00:54:46.482 --> 00:54:53.246]  You allow these fiat money changers control, they will use it to take over society, as Thomas Jefferson said 230 years ago.
[00:54:53.246 --> 00:54:59.451]  And we'd wake up homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered if we ever let the private banks take over the issuance of currency and credit.
[00:55:00.665 --> 00:55:03.507]  But yeah, here it is.
[00:55:03.507 --> 00:55:05.509]  Gold explodes as dollar falls.
[00:55:05.509 --> 00:55:06.430]  Market watch.
[00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:08.251]  Gold prices hit new record high.
[00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:10.753]  Wall Street Journal, AFP, dollar on weak footing.
[00:55:10.753 --> 00:55:12.514]  Gold strikes new record.
[00:55:12.514 --> 00:55:16.057]  IMF catapults from shunned agency to global central bank.
[00:55:16.057 --> 00:55:17.038]  The new bank of the world.
[00:55:18.356 --> 00:55:19.477]  I've got all these other headlines.
[00:55:19.477 --> 00:55:21.899]  Dollar tumbles on report of its demise.
[00:55:21.899 --> 00:55:27.863]  Ted, you did a gold offer here yesterday that I believe this morning you told me you can't offer anymore.
[00:55:27.863 --> 00:55:31.705]  You had gold you bought at the $9.90, $9.91 level.
[00:55:31.705 --> 00:55:33.527]  You were selling it in the market when it was $9.40.
[00:55:33.527 --> 00:55:36.849]  It's still up there and rising.
[00:55:36.849 --> 00:55:39.171]  What's the latest buys you've done of gold and silver?
[00:55:39.171 --> 00:55:41.953]  Because people are buying stuff you bought a month ago cheaper.
[00:55:41.953 --> 00:55:43.174]  I know you bought some other stuff that's
[00:55:43.954 --> 00:55:46.155]  Inexpensive compared to what the market is, a great deal.
[00:55:46.155 --> 00:55:48.696]  Still, tell folks about the deals you've got today.
[00:55:48.696 --> 00:55:57.620]  Well, yeah, the inventory is moving up just a little bit at this point, just because I'm, you know, my lowest stuff is gone, but I do still have francs at 236.
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:02.002]  Excuse me, you're, well, hold on, you're still, you do still have something from yesterday's ultra low deal.
[00:56:02.202 --> 00:56:04.364]  Well, I'll talk about that in a second.
[00:56:04.364 --> 00:56:06.645]  The Franks have just edged up $3 apiece.
[00:56:06.645 --> 00:56:07.686]  Okay, it sounded the same.
[00:56:07.686 --> 00:56:08.367]  They've gone up $3.
[00:56:08.367 --> 00:56:10.629]  Yep, and the British Sovereign too.
[00:56:10.629 --> 00:56:12.530]  They're at $2.91, they're at $2.88.
[00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:16.713]  So yeah, there was definitely a price increase in that particular arena.
[00:56:16.713 --> 00:56:19.936]  The things that I still have at yesterday's price is the silver.
[00:56:20.596 --> 00:56:20.897]  I think so.
[00:56:41.846 --> 00:56:48.988]  With the price at $1,047, $1,048, that's going to bring that support level up.
[00:56:48.988 --> 00:56:54.589]  I don't know if I'll have another opportunity to buy again in that $900 level.
[00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:59.210]  Alex, all I can say is that these opportunities to buy low are slipping away quickly.
[00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:07.613]  I'm watching the same thing happen that occurred here just a year ago when everything was melting apart in New York in the Wall Street markets.
[00:57:09.133 --> 00:57:11.774]  There was a supply of gold and silver coins that just dried up.
[00:57:11.774 --> 00:57:12.815]  You couldn't get them.
[00:57:12.815 --> 00:57:19.158]  I mean, if you wanted to buy just a simple bag of junk silver, you'd have to wait, you know, two, three, four, five, six weeks.
[00:57:19.158 --> 00:57:20.679]  Yeah, now is the time, folks.
[00:57:20.679 --> 00:57:23.501]  The rush is on, globally.
[00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:25.982]  The future market has gold even going up more.
[00:57:25.982 --> 00:57:26.022]  800-686-8000.
[00:57:28.243 --> 00:57:29.244]  Two, two, three, seven.
[00:57:58.303 --> 00:58:02.166]  You've got to remember, I started buying those Franks and Sovereigns at $988.
[00:58:02.166 --> 00:58:06.388]  And I was able to accumulate that inventory at that level.
[00:58:06.388 --> 00:58:07.969]  I mean, we just blew through that stuff.
[00:58:07.969 --> 00:58:14.574]  I still have a little bit left at that next tier up, which was trading right around that $945 level.
[00:58:14.574 --> 00:58:16.135]  Next thing you know, I'm going to be out of that.
[00:58:16.135 --> 00:58:17.495]  I'm going to have to go into this $1,000 range.
[00:58:18.736 --> 00:58:19.537]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:19.537 --> 00:58:20.837]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.316 --> 00:58:54.540]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.562]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.562 --> 00:59:05.091]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.091 --> 00:59:10.636]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.636 --> 00:59:12.258]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.478 --> 00:59:19.000]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:30.044]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.044 --> 00:59:30.824]  That's right.
[00:59:30.824 --> 00:59:33.385]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.385 --> 00:59:34.965]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:37.366]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:10.494]  Well, he is a best-selling author, former BBC presenter, former champion goalie, and
[01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:41.921]  He's an icon of getting people to expand their awareness, to expand their horizons, to question little bubbles that the social engineers, the mind controllers try to keep us in.
[01:00:41.921 --> 01:00:43.382]  He is David Icke.
[01:00:43.382 --> 01:00:48.387]  Now, he's going to be on with us for a full hour, maybe even a little bit longer next Monday.
[01:00:48.387 --> 01:00:52.170]  He's on a tour in the U.S., but I wanted to get him on today for just 30 minutes.
[01:00:53.257 --> 01:01:01.926]  To talk about the plunging dollar, the bringing in of the global currency, which is going to be an SDR bank-to-bank that he wrote about more than 12 years ago.
[01:01:03.803 --> 01:01:16.909]  What Obama is doing, what he's bringing in, how they announced the Internet's being turned over to a private global corporation, the dollar's being shut down, Obama's now the head of the United Nations Security Council, the real body with power.
[01:01:16.909 --> 01:01:24.152]  All these things are happening, and the great change is upon us as they expand the tyranny.
[01:01:24.152 --> 01:01:27.993]  But, in the middle of the darkness, the awakening is exponential.
[01:01:27.993 --> 01:01:31.795]  I'm seeing that, everyone I've talked to is seeing it, but David Icke's seeing it around the world.
[01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:35.256]  David Icke, thank you for coming on.
[01:01:52.847 --> 01:01:56.711]  Yeah, well, the crash of the dollar has been planned for a long, long, long, long time.
[01:01:56.711 --> 01:02:04.280]  It's all part of what I've been talking about for many, many years, which is how they're using America to destroy America.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.381]  The idea was for
[01:02:06.335 --> 01:02:23.425]  America to be pulled into overseas wars that stretches them militarily, stretches them financially, crash the economy, because if you're a superpower and you have the military and financial might to say no to a world government,
[01:02:24.145 --> 01:02:27.466]  Then the world government's not a tyranny across the world.
[01:02:27.466 --> 01:02:30.748]  It wants every single country subjugated.
[01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:39.511]  Therefore, any superpower with financial and military might to stand alone or stand its ground has to go.
[01:02:39.511 --> 01:02:40.651]  And this is what we're seeing.
[01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:45.033]  We're seeing the use of America to destroy America in one way.
[01:02:45.033 --> 01:02:49.055]  America's being used in terms of its military to expand the
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:50.821]  We're good to go.
[01:03:06.078 --> 01:03:15.863]  The Arab countries starting to really move towards disconnecting the dollar from being the oil currency and the reserve currency.
[01:03:15.863 --> 01:03:20.926]  And, you know, the American economy, like the British one, actually, it reminds me of
[01:03:21.929 --> 01:03:33.892]  You know in those cartoons when there's a chase going on, and eventually all the people in the chase run over the edge of the cliff, and for a while they keep running because they don't realize they've run out of land.
[01:03:33.892 --> 01:03:43.035]  And then someone looks down, realizes the land is gone, and then that awareness just, and they all fall and crash down into the ravine.
[01:03:43.035 --> 01:03:48.156]  And if people just looked at what the British and the American economy are,
[01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.466]  Standing on it this time.
[01:03:50.466 --> 01:03:52.047]  It's fresh air.
[01:03:52.047 --> 01:03:55.169]  It's simple illusion.
[01:03:55.169 --> 01:03:58.070]  There's nothing there that's holding it together.
[01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:04.194]  And I've been saying, Alex, since September when they crashed it, first of all, that there's a three stage process here.
[01:04:05.277 --> 01:04:08.740]  First, crash the economy, September 2008.
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:13.664]  Make everyone see there's a big problem which needs a solution.
[01:04:13.664 --> 01:04:26.575]  The solution is stage two, and that is throwing enormous cuckoo land amounts of money, hosing money at the cause of the problem, the banks, so it disappears in a great black hole.
[01:04:26.575 --> 01:04:27.236]  And the idea
[01:04:27.976 --> 01:04:28.816]  We're good to go.
[01:04:50.706 --> 01:04:53.689]  There's no response from governments, because they have no response.
[01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:54.269]  The barrel's empty.
[01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:55.310]  David Icke, stay there.
[01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:55.811]  Let's come back.
[01:04:55.811 --> 01:05:00.314]  And at that point, it's to bring in the international banking card, controlled by the House of Rothschild.
[01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:05.639]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.639 --> 01:05:10.163]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.163 --> 01:05:12.445]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.445 --> 01:05:14.066]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.066 --> 01:05:15.107]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.327 --> 01:05:23.749]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:06:07.257 --> 01:06:11.839]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.839 --> 01:06:17.422]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.722 --> 01:06:22.485]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.485 --> 01:06:26.107]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:30.930]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:30.930 --> 01:06:37.494]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.435]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:39.915 --> 01:06:43.117]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.

[01:07:01.397 --> 01:07:02.298]  You worry.
[01:07:02.298 --> 01:07:04.359]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:07:04.359 --> 01:07:07.002]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:07:07.002 --> 01:07:09.123]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:07:09.123 --> 01:07:10.745]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:07:10.745 --> 01:07:14.328]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:07:14.328 --> 01:07:19.572]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:07:19.572 --> 01:07:22.875]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:07:23.544 --> 01:07:25.225]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:07:25.225 --> 01:07:28.126]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:07:28.126 --> 01:07:31.587]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:07:31.587 --> 01:07:40.230]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:45.052]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:07:45.052 --> 01:07:49.934]  Go to Linda's website ofthefield.com and take advantage of special offers, or if you're not online,
[01:07:50.253 --> 01:07:54.896]  Call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:07:54.896 --> 01:07:58.298]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:07:58.298 --> 01:08:00.819]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:08:00.819 --> 01:08:06.222]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.222 --> 01:08:08.504]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:16.991 --> 01:08:20.312]  David Icke is our guest for the next 20 minutes or so.
[01:08:20.312 --> 01:08:23.813]  And we've got David for a full hour next Monday.
[01:08:23.813 --> 01:08:28.474]  We'll tell you about the events here in the United States and Arizona, New Mexico, other places.
[01:08:28.474 --> 01:08:29.514]  He's going all over the world.
[01:08:29.514 --> 01:08:31.075]  Big awakening happening.
[01:08:31.075 --> 01:08:33.195]  But First Nations just joined us.
[01:08:33.195 --> 01:08:38.297]  Recap, David, the controlled implosion of the dollar that you've been writing about for over a decade.
[01:08:38.297 --> 01:08:41.878]  The globalists have bragged that to make way for world government,
[01:08:42.458 --> 01:08:51.967]  And I hear brag about this on NPR, that we can't have a high standard of living, that that hurts the environment to have more than one child, our carbon footprint, babies are bad.
[01:08:51.967 --> 01:08:59.895]  And at the UN Climate Summit in 92, Maurice Strong said, we must destroy industrial society.
[01:08:59.895 --> 01:09:04.460]  So they always said they wanted to have a fiat banking system, get everybody so in debt,
[01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:08.396]  That there's more debt than there is real tangible assets in the world.
[01:09:08.396 --> 01:09:16.032]  And now they've got conservatively, according to economists we've had on, between 500 and a thousand times more fiat debt they've made.
[01:09:17.093 --> 01:09:22.618]  That the banks use to buy things, then there are real assets in all the world at their highest value.
[01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:24.840]  So, this is a complete fraud.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.921]  A total Ponzi scheme.
[01:09:25.921 --> 01:09:29.363]  And here's AFP, Agency French Press.
[01:09:29.363 --> 01:09:29.744]  U.S.
[01:09:29.744 --> 01:09:32.306]  economic decline forges new world order.
[01:09:32.306 --> 01:09:39.712]  Hundreds of other headlines about how good the new world order is, how America's now going to get it, how the Arabs and Russia and China are teaming up.
[01:09:39.712 --> 01:09:43.836]  But meanwhile, the same central banks that own them, the global controllers,
[01:09:44.176 --> 01:09:45.498]  They're orchestrating all this.
[01:09:45.498 --> 01:10:00.717]  So, David, break down the three phases you talk about, starting last year with the controlled banking implosion, stealing the $23.7 trillion, saying that it was going into the secret coffers, never spending it on the mortgages, and now where we're going from here.
[01:10:01.721 --> 01:10:14.204]  Yeah, well, like I say, it's planned to be in three stages and they're becoming, you know, blatant to crash the economy in September 2009 so that everyone sees there's a problem and there's a problem to address.
[01:10:14.204 --> 01:10:24.947]  So the way they address it is stage two, which is hosing trillions, staggering amounts of credit money, fiat money, at the cause of the problem, the banks.
[01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:33.071]  The idea being, and of course ask the Federal Reserve and they'll confirm, it's gone into a black hole and no one knows where it's gone.
[01:10:33.071 --> 01:10:34.112]  That's the idea.
[01:10:34.112 --> 01:10:49.221]  And phase two is about emptying the barrels of government, emptying the pockets of government, bringing an end to the credit lines of government so they have no further manoeuvre of response to what is coming in stage three.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:58.586]  And that is to crash the economy on a scale that, you know, makes September 2008 look like a tea party.
[01:10:58.586 --> 01:11:13.417]  And the figures you're talking about, Alex, in terms of the fresh air money in relation to real resources, that's the enormous, staggering bubble that they're going to use to cause Stage 3 and crash Stage 3.
[01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:16.200]  And the idea is to destroy America.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.241]  We're good to go.
[01:11:43.892 --> 01:11:44.273]  Absolutely.
[01:12:05.349 --> 01:12:05.970]  I don't think so.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:25.687]  Where we're going to need to start engaging this and with swine flu and the economy and all the rest of it.
[01:12:25.687 --> 01:12:27.049]  David, let's go over that.
[01:12:27.049 --> 01:12:35.540]  The idea is to throw everything at us in a short period of time, short period of years, to bring about this global change very quickly because
[01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:39.783]  Humanity is just exhausted, frightened, terrified.
[01:12:39.783 --> 01:12:40.443]  Do something!
[01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:41.204]  Do something!
[01:12:41.204 --> 01:12:42.224]  And that's the idea.
[01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:51.770]  That's why we must stay strong, and we must not be subjugated by this, and not fall to fear, and give our power away as a result.
[01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:59.574]  Well, David, I want you to walk through that step by step, and I totally agree with you in the time we have left with you today, but I want to go back and just point out
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:04.624]  You eloquently laid out what's happening, but this is not your opinion.
[01:13:04.624 --> 01:13:07.286]  This is all in IMF, World Bank documents.
[01:13:07.286 --> 01:13:08.768]  It's openly stated.
[01:13:08.768 --> 01:13:15.254]  We told people at the time that they would steal the tens of trillions, hoard it, use it to buy up the economy.
[01:13:16.485 --> 01:13:18.265]  That they were vertically integrating.
[01:13:18.265 --> 01:13:23.587]  They cut off credit, then they hoard the money, then they go out and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[01:13:23.587 --> 01:13:29.888]  That's why they say it's the new economy where you're homeless or don't have a job or take a cut and pay.
[01:13:29.888 --> 01:13:37.850]  It's the jobless recovery because everything is gauged by the fiat money changers consolidating global power, but that's only part of it.
[01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:39.751]  Demonizing the U.S.
[01:13:39.751 --> 01:13:43.374]  and England's name worldwide with wars, putting our troops under U.N.
[01:13:43.374 --> 01:13:50.781]  control, DHS reports demonizing gun owners, conservatives, those that don't like the New World Order or want to end the Feds.
[01:13:50.781 --> 01:13:54.905]  Suddenly they have Stasi TV ads, spy on your neighbor.
[01:13:54.905 --> 01:13:58.628]  Suddenly they've enlisted, gotten the Girl Scouts to spy.
[01:13:58.628 --> 01:13:59.809]  Suddenly the Boy Scouts.
[01:13:59.809 --> 01:14:02.372]  I mean everything, as you said, is a quickening.
[01:14:02.372 --> 01:14:04.674]  It has gone a quantum level leap
[01:14:05.094 --> 01:14:06.395]  We're good to go.
[01:14:23.057 --> 01:14:26.239]  The thing is that it's a simple equation.
[01:14:26.239 --> 01:14:31.221]  The more you centralize power, the more power you have to centralize even quicker.
[01:14:31.221 --> 01:14:41.385]  And that's why the process of centralization has got faster and faster and faster through the 20th century, eventually reaching the point where it was so blatant it was given a name, globalization.
[01:14:41.385 --> 01:14:42.726]  And that's gone on and on and on.
[01:14:42.726 --> 01:14:46.968]  And as more and more power has been centralized, it's had the power to centralize quicker.
[01:14:46.968 --> 01:14:49.329]  So the whole thing is getting faster and faster.
[01:14:49.329 --> 01:14:51.970]  And the other thing, I mean, we've only got half an hour today, Alex, but
[01:14:52.410 --> 01:15:00.773]  You know, it's something that I've been writing about and I'm getting much, much deeper and more understanding about as the days pass now.
[01:15:00.773 --> 01:15:17.680]  You know, when people look at the speed and all those things you absolutely rightly detail there, you look at the speed in which all this is coming in, in all these different areas of our lives, in all the different fine detail of our lives, and it's coming in in a coordinated way, to a coordinated time scale,
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.541]  This is not people sitting around a table saying, what's our next move, guys?
[01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:22.882]  This is much deeper.
[01:15:22.882 --> 01:15:25.103]  The rabbit hole is much deeper than this.
[01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:31.565]  And it's in finding the source, if you like, of the rabbit hole, that's what's going to bring the system down.
[01:15:31.565 --> 01:15:34.446]  And we're going to do that in the next few years, no question.
[01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:36.027]  It is coming down.
[01:15:36.027 --> 01:15:40.688]  Well, David, I want to talk about that.
[01:15:40.688 --> 01:15:45.190]  It comes down, it's in a far less extreme state than it would otherwise be if we do nothing.
[01:15:47.219 --> 01:15:50.026]  David, I want you to get into that kind of a brief overview.
[01:15:50.026 --> 01:15:53.154]  We'll cover it more on Monday and talk about your new book and some of the events coming up.
[01:15:54.935 --> 01:15:59.578]  A point you just made about how this is coordinated.
[01:15:59.578 --> 01:16:17.610]  They are banning homeschooling in Australia, England, the U.S., or attempting to, simultaneously with the same PR, with the word-for-word same scripts, and I see it in the local news, they are banning neighbors, including police officers, keeping each other's children
[01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:18.711]  Period.
[01:16:18.711 --> 01:16:20.672]  They are banning garage sales.
[01:16:20.672 --> 01:16:27.936]  They are banning people selling corner fruit stands in the countryside simultaneously worldwide.
[01:16:27.936 --> 01:16:33.019]  It is all admittedly coordinated by this private corporate borg.
[01:16:33.019 --> 01:16:35.381]  Break that down and what is the endgame?
[01:16:35.381 --> 01:16:36.782]  How does the flu tie into it?
[01:16:37.386 --> 01:16:41.348]  Well, the way they can do this, Alex, is a simple structure.
[01:16:41.348 --> 01:16:42.168]  It has to be simple.
[01:16:42.168 --> 01:16:43.209]  It looks complex.
[01:16:43.209 --> 01:16:45.690]  We know what is all happening as you're talking about it now.
[01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:46.670]  It looks complex.
[01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:47.511]  How do they do this?
[01:16:47.511 --> 01:16:50.912]  But actually, it's a very simple structure.
[01:16:50.912 --> 01:16:53.114]  It's like a transnational corporation.
[01:16:53.114 --> 01:16:58.076]  You've got their headquarters, which is overwhelmingly in Europe, and then you've got the
[01:16:58.926 --> 01:16:59.487]  We're good to go.
[01:17:19.446 --> 01:17:40.434]  You have a subsidiary network of secret societies controlled by the bloodline families, and their job is to introduce the centrally dictated global agenda in their sphere of influence, by controlling that country's banking, media ownership, the corporations, the cartels, etc.
[01:17:40.434 --> 01:17:46.356]  And so, this is how they can do it, globally, as you've rightly described with this coordination.
[01:17:46.736 --> 01:17:54.625]  It's because in each country, these subsidiary networks of secret societies are introducing the centrally dictated agenda.
[01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:57.208]  So of course, because they're all doing it, it's happening.
[01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:59.688]  In every country at the same time.
[01:17:59.688 --> 01:18:01.269]  This is how it's possible.
[01:18:01.269 --> 01:18:07.834]  And the idea is to subjugate humanity on a scale that would make all world wins.
[01:18:07.834 --> 01:18:18.261]  There's one area, Alex, that really does need a lot of focus on because I've been seeing so much around the world at different aspects of this and that's how the state
[01:18:19.082 --> 01:18:20.424]  He's after our children.
[01:18:32.316 --> 01:18:33.217]  We're good to go.
[01:18:59.162 --> 01:18:59.242]  I'm
[01:19:26.912 --> 01:19:43.081]  This is why in Britain, I'm sure it's happening in America too, I'm sure you'll confirm this, but in Britain we're having children taken away from their parents by social services, in fact I know it's happening in America because I've done some research recently on it, for the most extraordinary reasons.
[01:19:43.081 --> 01:19:47.664]  For instance, we've had a couple, they spent £38,000 on fertility treatment to have a child,
[01:19:50.806 --> 01:20:00.693]  When the social services came round after the child was born, just a very, very small baby, the mother joked that the birth had ruined her figure, just to laugh.
[01:20:00.693 --> 01:20:04.036]  They took her children away, and they're still taking her children away.
[01:20:04.036 --> 01:20:15.105]  And then what the social services say is, if you want to see your children at all, like once a month or so, then you must not challenge our decision, otherwise you're never going to see them again.
[01:20:15.105 --> 01:20:16.046]  And you must pay them!
[01:20:16.046 --> 01:20:17.887]  It's not kind of here and there.
[01:20:19.375 --> 01:20:27.719]  In a million, it's becoming more and more constant, more and more common, and it's more part of the process to drive the brave new world.
[01:20:27.719 --> 01:20:29.500]  It is all scientifically.
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:47.650]  I've had Charlotte Isserby, the former head of the Department of Education Policy, that was the plan in the 80s, was to in the family, it's all on record, that's what they say in eco-science, in the family, raise everybody in dormitories, sterilize us through the water supply, through the vaccines, and yes, simultaneously,
[01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:52.773]  Now, if you yell at your child, don't run out on the road, that's abuse.
[01:20:52.773 --> 01:21:15.606]  They take your children, no judge, no jury, no due process, and we know the family courts were set up as eugenics courts in England, Germany, and the U.S., and absolutely, they're now saying you can't babysit your neighbor's kids, you can't talk to your neighbor's kids unless you have a government license, and I talk to people that live in England, it's happened to me when I've been there, they come up to you and ask, why are you walking your dog?
[01:21:15.606 --> 01:21:16.247]  Are you a criminal?
[01:21:16.667 --> 01:21:19.468]  And so everyone's being trained to answer questions.
[01:21:19.468 --> 01:21:21.208]  The secret police are everywhere.
[01:21:21.208 --> 01:21:25.169]  And now in Europe, England, and the U.S., they go into the schools.
[01:21:25.169 --> 01:21:29.511]  And I saw this in Billings, Montana when I was there last week at the hotel.
[01:21:29.511 --> 01:21:34.552]  A whole hotel full of Girl Scouts being trained by Homeland Security to spy.
[01:21:34.552 --> 01:21:36.433]  I wasn't reading this in the AP.
[01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:37.773]  It was in the news.
[01:21:37.773 --> 01:21:40.994]  I was witnessing it without even looking, David.
[01:21:45.827 --> 01:21:58.592]  It's interesting, the more I research this and the more I go down these different channels of control, manipulation and imposition, the more times the name Rothschild ends up at the end of it.
[01:21:59.712 --> 01:22:12.216]  This whole mind manipulation, Brave New World, and all the rest of it, this social engineering, comes out of the Frankfurt School in Germany, which moved then into America to change the face of America.
[01:22:12.216 --> 01:22:13.656]  That's what he wanted to do.
[01:22:13.656 --> 01:22:18.297]  The Frankfurt School was fundamentally connected to the House of Rothschild.
[01:22:18.297 --> 01:22:24.959]  The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations is another face of this, or another mask on its face.
[01:22:25.339 --> 01:22:27.780]  And then you go through the banking system, which is happening now.
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:33.103]  The Rothschilds have controlled the banking system globally for centuries.
[01:22:33.103 --> 01:22:45.369]  And more and more, as time has come to the present day, we need to focus on this dynasty because it really is at the core, the spider of this whole web.
[01:22:45.369 --> 01:22:47.250]  And they operate in the background.
[01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:49.892]  So, you know, once upon a time, as you well know,
[01:22:50.848 --> 01:22:53.131]  Everyone knew about the Rothschilds' power.
[01:22:53.131 --> 01:23:05.163]  What they've done through the latter part of the 20th century is hidden behind front organizations, front nominee directors, all the ways that they do it to hide the extent of their power.
[01:23:05.163 --> 01:23:05.583]  It's like...
[01:23:06.627 --> 01:23:08.889]  The Rothschilds are not as powerful as they used to be.
[01:23:08.889 --> 01:23:09.650]  Are you kidding?
[01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:11.391]  They're more powerful than they've ever been.
[01:23:11.391 --> 01:23:21.580]  Well, that's what I've researched, is every time I research a group, a power group, a takeover, the environmental movement, the carbon tax, it's always Rothschild, which is intermarried with the British Royals.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:25.503]  Are you saying they're greater than the German House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha?
[01:23:25.503 --> 01:23:28.506]  You're saying at the very center is the Rothschilds.
[01:23:29.245 --> 01:23:34.028]  I'm saying that at operational level, all roads lead to the Rothschilds.
[01:23:34.028 --> 01:23:49.158]  You see, you've only got to do some simple background research, never mind detailed background research, into Israel, and you realize very quickly, from the start, Israel is not Israel, the land of the Jews, it's Rothschild land.
[01:23:49.158 --> 01:23:57.183]  The Jews are being played like a violin in Israel, and being set up for some appalling things in the future.
[01:23:57.723 --> 01:24:00.704]  Because the Rothschilds own the place.
[01:24:00.704 --> 01:24:02.785]  The Rothschilds control the American government.
[01:24:02.785 --> 01:24:13.250]  That's why the American government gives fantastic, extraordinary amounts of money to that small slither of land called Israel, including enormous military spending.
[01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:24.776]  It's because if the same force controls both countries' governments, then one hand of the force says, give the money, and one hand of the force puts its hand out and says, thank you very much for it.
[01:24:24.776 --> 01:24:26.117]  This is why it goes on.
[01:24:26.117 --> 01:24:28.278]  This is why Israel has nuclear weapons.
[01:24:29.159 --> 01:24:37.563]  And we have this, Alex, tell me it's not true, but it is, this policy, official policy in America, not to ask them if they have them.
[01:24:37.563 --> 01:24:40.685]  Obama's just confirmed that he's going to continue to that.
[01:24:40.685 --> 01:24:46.148]  So we're saying, oh, great danger to the world, Iran, or they might develop a nuclear weapon.
[01:24:46.148 --> 01:24:55.332]  And then we've got this fantastic nuclear arsenal in Israel, of course, who have never been slow in using high-tech weaponry.
[01:24:55.332 --> 01:24:56.713]  That's what we had at the head of the
[01:24:57.941 --> 01:25:07.127]  International Energy Agency, Nuclear Energy Agency, Atomic Energy Agency this week saying that the biggest threat to the Middle East is the nuclear arsenal of Israel.
[01:25:08.897 --> 01:25:20.344]  Mordecai Venunu, an Israeli who worked in the nuclear industry, of course, he came out, spoke to a British newspaper, the Sunday Times, I think it was, some many, many years ago now, decades ago.
[01:25:20.344 --> 01:25:21.504]  And got clapped in prison.
[01:25:21.504 --> 01:25:28.108]  And said that Israel's got this massive nuclear arsenal, and he was lured to Italy.
[01:25:28.108 --> 01:25:30.009]  He was kidnapped by Mossad and jailed for 18 years.
[01:25:31.803 --> 01:25:34.485]  Now, David, we've only got five minutes left with you.
[01:25:34.485 --> 01:25:43.811]  You said you've got big news for us Monday about the mass awakening that's happening, also the center of the spiderweb, also your new book coming out.
[01:25:43.811 --> 01:25:44.451]  I agree with you.
[01:25:44.451 --> 01:25:46.273]  The takeover of the family is the key.
[01:25:46.273 --> 01:25:50.035]  If they're able to tell people that they don't have free association...
[01:26:02.881 --> 01:26:07.363]  The church and stuff, it's something that holds people together.
[01:26:07.363 --> 01:26:07.963]  So they're targeting?
[01:26:07.963 --> 01:26:13.425]  They're targeting anything that holds people together, just because they don't want any structure of others coming together.
[01:26:13.425 --> 01:26:17.946]  They want to divide us, keep us apart, and keep us lost and bewildered.
[01:26:18.456 --> 01:26:38.904]  But, for the first time ever, in major polls, 75% are hired, know there's a global banking cartel, know the Federal Reserve's private, know the Bank of England's shareholders are private, and so all the puppetry, and Obama and Bush and Blair to be the head of the UN, and Obama to head... Oh yeah, that's a surprise, isn't it, Blair?
[01:26:38.904 --> 01:26:44.507]  You know, you've got to be a war criminal before you can be President of Europe, of course.
[01:26:44.507 --> 01:26:47.368]  But the good news is, and I want you to speak to this, is that
[01:26:48.479 --> 01:26:59.064]  People now are addressing the shadow government, the private banking cartel, and I don't see that being reversed, even by staged wars, or bioweapons releases, or Tony Blair running Europe.
[01:26:59.064 --> 01:27:00.685]  Break it down for us.
[01:27:00.685 --> 01:27:02.346]  Well, it's quite simple.
[01:27:02.346 --> 01:27:15.593]  They have not spent 24-7, for decade after decade after decade, keeping humanity dumbed down and keeping us in ignorance of what's going on, because it's a bit of fun.
[01:27:16.233 --> 01:27:19.475]  They've done it because they know we have the numbers.
[01:27:19.475 --> 01:27:26.640]  They may have the military, they may have law enforcement, they may have the media, they may have all of these things, but we've got the numbers.
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:33.984]  Because the number of people in full knowledge and full awareness of what they're doing is a tiny fraction of the number of people on this planet.
[01:27:33.984 --> 01:27:38.767]  And what terrifies them is enough of those people waking up and seeing what's happening.
[01:27:38.767 --> 01:27:40.929]  It is happening.
[01:27:40.929 --> 01:27:43.871]  People are waking up in increasingly large numbers.
[01:27:45.491 --> 01:27:47.913]  They may seem to be, you know, all-powerful.
[01:27:47.913 --> 01:27:48.714]  They're not!
[01:27:48.714 --> 01:27:49.595]  They're not all-powerful.
[01:27:49.595 --> 01:27:52.497]  We're going to see that as the next few years pass.
[01:27:52.497 --> 01:27:58.562]  And part of this breakneck speed of change is panic.
[01:27:58.562 --> 01:28:05.488]  They've got to get the lid down before we break a threshold and cross a line where enough people are aware of this to bring it down.
[01:28:05.488 --> 01:28:07.349]  And we're getting there, we're getting there.
[01:28:07.349 --> 01:28:12.013]  It may not seem like it, it won't seem like it for a while, but we're getting there and we will get there.
[01:28:12.273 --> 01:28:21.898]  Yes, but that makes it doubly dangerous for the New World Order and for humanity because I agree with you until about five six years ago they were arrogant, they were haughty, at least their servants were.
[01:28:21.898 --> 01:28:31.963]  Obviously the cold-blooded controllers behind the scenes are very serious and really tuned into their Luciferian force and according to their own statements and understood but even their minions now are scared
[01:28:32.443 --> 01:28:39.246]  Which is kind of a negative thing, because now they're actually really working hard, really trying to accelerate it, so it's a catch-22.
[01:28:39.246 --> 01:28:46.448]  It's proving everything we said as they announced open world government, exactly as we said they would, run exactly as we said it would be.
[01:28:46.448 --> 01:28:52.190]  So that's giving us great credibility, but the time is short, because we're under full-scale launch.
[01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:59.413]  Give us, in the last minute, we've got, David, where you're speaking and what you think the time frame is on this whole implosion.
[01:28:59.963 --> 01:29:03.247]  Well, I'm speaking in Santa Fe.
[01:29:03.247 --> 01:29:05.249]  All details on my website davidike.com.
[01:29:05.249 --> 01:29:07.611]  Just go into the site and it's right in front of your eyes.
[01:29:07.611 --> 01:29:09.754]  That's this Sunday for eight hours.
[01:29:09.754 --> 01:29:17.923]  And then I'm speaking in Phoenix, which will probably be the last time I speak in America for a while because of the way things are going in my life and circumstances.
[01:29:18.363 --> 01:29:21.864]  That's on the 17th of October, the Saturday, week on Saturday.
[01:29:21.864 --> 01:29:24.445]  And again, I'll be speaking for 8 hours, details on the website.
[01:29:24.445 --> 01:29:26.525]  I'll tell you what my timescale is.
[01:29:26.525 --> 01:29:33.267]  The next few years we're going to see this move on and move on and we're going to think there's no hope.
[01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:36.468]  By 2015, 2016, this is coming down.
[01:29:36.468 --> 01:29:39.469]  It's coming down, and it's coming down in an extraordinary way.
[01:29:39.469 --> 01:29:40.449]  We've got to end it.
[01:29:40.449 --> 01:29:41.990]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:43.030]  Max Keiser is coming up.
[01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:45.251]  David will be on with us for a full hour next Monday.
[01:29:45.251 --> 01:29:46.031]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:51.351 --> 01:29:54.338]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.338 --> 01:29:57.946]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.155 --> 01:30:04.158]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.158 --> 01:30:09.503]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.503 --> 01:30:11.545]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.545 --> 01:30:16.549]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.549 --> 01:30:17.730]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:18.851]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.851 --> 01:30:20.753]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.753 --> 01:30:21.814]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.814 --> 01:30:23.836]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.036 --> 01:30:25.337]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:26.878]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.878 --> 01:30:32.141]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.141 --> 01:30:35.723]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.723 --> 01:30:39.185]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.545 --> 01:30:40.766]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.766 --> 01:30:41.667]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.667 --> 01:30:42.769]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.769 --> 01:30:43.710]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:44.811]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.811 --> 01:30:47.854]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.854 --> 01:30:49.636]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.636 --> 01:30:50.537]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.222 --> 01:31:05.529]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.529 --> 01:31:10.055]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.055 --> 01:31:12.338]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.338 --> 01:31:13.960]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.002]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.222 --> 01:31:23.647]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:33:32.242 --> 01:33:33.723]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:33.723 --> 01:33:34.343]  Welcome.
[01:33:34.343 --> 01:33:36.424]  We are back live.
[01:33:36.424 --> 01:33:42.587]  You know, I've been invited by David Icke repeatedly to his events, and I've always said no, because I'm too busy.
[01:33:42.587 --> 01:33:47.609]  But tentatively, I'm going to be at the Phoenix event, because Mancow's invited me, David's invited me.
[01:33:49.136 --> 01:33:52.219]  And he says this may be one of the last times in years he's in the U.S.
[01:33:52.219 --> 01:33:55.382]  and so I'm going to, tentatively, I'm going to Phoenix.
[01:33:55.382 --> 01:33:56.843]  Not this weekend, next weekend.
[01:33:56.843 --> 01:33:58.644]  But that doesn't mean I'm going to be speaking or involved.
[01:33:58.644 --> 01:33:59.205]  I don't want to be.
[01:33:59.205 --> 01:34:00.466]  I'm going to be hiding.
[01:34:00.466 --> 01:34:01.647]  I just want to meet David in person.
[01:34:01.647 --> 01:34:06.071]  I've interviewed him so many times and been on other shows with him so many times.
[01:34:06.071 --> 01:34:08.353]  So I'm probably going to that event.
[01:34:08.353 --> 01:34:10.434]  So that is, but I'm not sure.
[01:34:10.434 --> 01:34:12.636]  But just side issue, exciting.
[01:34:12.636 --> 01:34:13.857]  Just talked to David Icke.
[01:34:13.857 --> 01:34:15.078]  Alan Watts coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:39.363]  We are joined here in just a second by Max Keiser, who, of course, is the host of the BBC Oracle, host of Al Jazeera shows, host of Press TV, host of Russia Today, the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange, produced TV shows with Alec Baldwin, really knows his stuff, not from the left-right paradigm, but exposing corporate communism, as he calls it.
[01:34:40.063 --> 01:34:45.084]  So he really gave a devastating interview to Russia today that I really think in five minutes boiled it all down.
[01:34:45.084 --> 01:34:48.725]  We're gonna be talking to Max and picking his brain a little bit more about what's really happening with this dollar.
[01:34:48.725 --> 01:34:53.287]  Is this the final plunge or is this just the beginning of the dead cat bounce downwards?
[01:34:53.287 --> 01:35:00.629]  And what will a dollar collapse, either gradual or more quickly collapsing, fastest in a year?
[01:35:01.249 --> 01:35:03.830]  We've already seen quite a collapse last few years.
[01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:05.191]  Four or five years is gradual.
[01:35:05.191 --> 01:35:06.752]  We'll talk to Max Keiser in a moment.
[01:35:06.752 --> 01:35:10.974]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson, owner of the Genesis Network and also owner of Minus Resources.
[01:35:10.974 --> 01:35:13.095]  You know, when I buy gold, I buy it from Ted.
[01:35:13.095 --> 01:35:17.577]  Because the deals he offers you, the deals we pitch on this show, I only want the best deals from my audience.
[01:35:17.577 --> 01:35:18.697]  I tell Ted that.
[01:35:18.697 --> 01:35:21.158]  These Alex Jones specials are the specials I'm getting.
[01:35:21.158 --> 01:35:22.259]  Ted buys gold at $910 an ounce.
[01:35:22.259 --> 01:35:22.939]  He sells it when it's $1,040.
[01:35:27.065 --> 01:35:33.673]  He bought into the market at that time at a, you know, $9.10, $9.11, $9.12 layer, $9.90 then last week.
[01:35:33.673 --> 01:35:35.616]  He keeps selling it at that price until he sells out.
[01:35:36.977 --> 01:35:42.282]  That's how he's become one of the fastest growing and large gold zone brokers out there.
[01:35:42.282 --> 01:35:50.229]  Now, he's sold out of that stuff at the $9.99, $9.95 level, but he's got it at another level, way below $1,047.
[01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:53.773]  And the futures are even higher than that right now.
[01:35:53.773 --> 01:35:55.915]  We'll talk to Max Keiser, an expert on this in a moment.
[01:35:55.915 --> 01:36:00.879]  But I wanted to briefly bring Ted up to tell you the coins he's got, how long the offer lasts.
[01:36:00.879 --> 01:36:01.440]  Ted Anderson.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:04.803]  Yeah, yeah, we're going to go until midnight tonight for sure.
[01:36:04.803 --> 01:36:12.069]  We're selling the Frank currently right now at $236 apiece, and the British Sovereign at $291.
[01:36:12.069 --> 01:36:14.651]  We also have the Walking Liberty Halves still at that $869, Lakota's at $2230.
[01:36:18.414 --> 01:36:21.615]  And you know, really, it's a great buy across the board.
[01:36:21.615 --> 01:36:30.119]  Alex, what's going on right now in the market, though, is that, I mean, our business volume has at least hiked by ten times of where it was just a month ago.
[01:36:30.119 --> 01:36:37.862]  And every single dealer across the United States is experiencing the very same thing, and we're all fighting over the same items out there in the marketplace.
[01:36:38.302 --> 01:36:49.048]  So you're 36 brokers, as you told me last night, are up there until midnight, one every night, they're exhausted, and you're running out of gold and silver supplies at any price, so people will find out.
[01:36:49.048 --> 01:36:51.509]  If they don't buy now, they're really going to regret it later.
[01:36:51.509 --> 01:36:53.911]  That's what all the trends and evidence shows.
[01:36:53.911 --> 01:36:54.811]  Well, they sure will.
[01:36:54.811 --> 01:36:58.193]  I mean, obviously, they're going to pay more if they wait at this particular time.
[01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:02.114]  But, you know, all I can say, Alex, is that the demand is there.
[01:37:02.114 --> 01:37:05.215]  We're going to end up with short supply, just like we did a year ago.
[01:37:05.215 --> 01:37:12.077]  The market is much bigger than it was a year ago, and the mints are trying to mint more, but you know what?
[01:37:12.077 --> 01:37:13.498]  There's just not enough.
[01:37:13.498 --> 01:37:23.841]  I mean, when you watch the dollar do what it's doing right now, and the foreign market's doing what they're doing, people are just concerned about their money that they put away for retirement and their savings accounts.
[01:37:24.201 --> 01:37:32.328]  The money that they have in the stock market, etc., etc., and they're turning it over to gold and silver, and the demand is bigger than the supply.
[01:37:32.328 --> 01:37:33.209]  That's just the way it is.
[01:37:33.209 --> 01:37:33.829]  Absolutely.
[01:37:33.829 --> 01:37:43.658]  Now, tell people briefly, because we're going to Max Keiser, the coins you have at the lower price and what you bought these coins at in the market versus what it is now, the total savings.
[01:37:43.658 --> 01:37:47.421]  Well, I'm edging up to the supply that I picked up at that $9.94 level.
[01:37:47.421 --> 01:37:48.762]  Now, we were looking at the $9.88 stuff yesterday.
[01:37:50.399 --> 01:37:50.719]  I think?
[01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:07.672]  Yeah, it's a crazy Eddie-level good deal.
[01:38:07.672 --> 01:38:10.434]  I mean, that is a fantastic deal.
[01:38:10.434 --> 01:38:14.477]  The answer to it is if I reprice things in today's market, it's a lot higher.
[01:38:14.477 --> 01:38:16.358]  Not just a little bit, but a lot higher.
[01:38:16.358 --> 01:38:21.422]  And it isn't going to be too long before... I mean, I'm not an eccentric billionaire.
[01:38:22.022 --> 01:38:25.165]  I have so much money that I can buy supply with and that's it.
[01:38:25.165 --> 01:38:27.446]  My resources are limited.
[01:38:27.446 --> 01:38:37.975]  But you're very competitive and you like blasting the competition and if you buy gold lower and silver go lower, why not sell it at the lower price instead of doing what most people do, jacking it up.
[01:38:37.975 --> 01:38:40.057]  That's why you're growing so fast, Ted.
[01:38:40.057 --> 01:38:42.859]  That's why we hear your ads on national radio and TV.
[01:38:42.859 --> 01:38:45.241]  That's why Midas Resources is so respected.
[01:38:45.241 --> 01:38:46.202]  Here's the number briefly.
[01:38:46.442 --> 01:38:47.202]  800-686-2237.
[01:38:47.202 --> 01:38:52.085]  800-686-2237.
[01:38:52.085 --> 01:38:54.266]  Gold at that $9.94 level.
[01:38:54.266 --> 01:38:58.568]  Silver at the even lower level in the market, even though it's way up.
[01:38:58.568 --> 01:38:58.968]  800-686-2237.
[01:38:58.968 --> 01:39:03.730]  And you can only hold that until, uh, when?
[01:39:03.730 --> 01:39:05.391]  I mean, I'm gonna hold it until tonight.
[01:39:05.391 --> 01:39:08.712]  I mean, just because of the fact that even if I have to lose on the deal, I will.
[01:39:08.712 --> 01:39:11.754]  I just appreciate the customers and the business.
[01:39:11.754 --> 01:39:13.134]  And I just think it's the right thing to do.
[01:39:13.134 --> 01:39:14.515]  People need to get gold and silver now.
[01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:16.690]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:16.690 --> 01:39:19.011]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:39:19.011 --> 01:39:20.291]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:39:20.291 --> 01:39:21.792]  Take advantage of it or you're insane.
[01:39:21.792 --> 01:39:22.812]  Let's go to Max Keiser.
[01:39:22.812 --> 01:39:24.653]  He's unaffiliated with me or Ted.
[01:39:24.653 --> 01:39:28.754]  Does that sound like a good deal to you, Max Keiser?
[01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:29.975]  Yeah.
[01:39:29.975 --> 01:39:31.175]  I'm sorry, they didn't have your mic up.
[01:39:31.175 --> 01:39:31.596]  Say it again.
[01:39:31.596 --> 01:39:33.977]  Oh, without a doubt.
[01:39:33.977 --> 01:39:34.657]  Without a doubt.
[01:39:36.226 --> 01:39:40.572]  Now, now, you've been a gold bug for a long time and you've been very successful with that.
[01:39:40.572 --> 01:39:43.876]  Let's talk about dollar tumbles on report of its demise.
[01:39:43.876 --> 01:39:44.797]  You're in Paris.
[01:39:44.797 --> 01:39:46.720]  You've got some inside info.
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.244]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com, you've got the floor.
[01:39:50.244 --> 01:39:51.967]  Tell us what's happening right now.
[01:39:53.624 --> 01:40:10.292]  Well, you know, Alex, Robert Fisk had a great story in The Independent in the UK this week, and he was talking about the oil-producing nations in the world, they want to get out of pricing oil in dollars.
[01:40:10.292 --> 01:40:15.394]  They want to start pricing oil in a new currency, a basket of currencies.
[01:40:16.315 --> 01:40:31.748]  Anything but the dollar, because the dollar gives the US a really unfair advantage in the world markets, because any country that wants to buy oil, they first have to buy dollars, because oil only trades in dollars.
[01:40:31.748 --> 01:40:34.230]  And this is a very unfair advantage that the US has.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:43.023]  And what these countries are noticing, countries like China, Russia, Iran, is that the U.S.
[01:40:43.023 --> 01:40:57.070]  is using the profits that they're making from this monopoly pricing power of the dollar and the price of oil, and what's called seniorage, which is they basically get a commission on all the dollars that they're producing.
[01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:58.631]  They're using the profits
[01:40:59.528 --> 01:41:10.215]  To, you know, fund their wars, to fund the Pentagon, to fund the invasion of Iraq, or the invasion of Afghanistan, or now, you know, looks like the invasion of Iran.
[01:41:10.215 --> 01:41:18.861]  And the thing about Iran is that Iran and China signed, China signed an $8 billion deal for oil with Iran.
[01:41:19.475 --> 01:41:36.446]  So China is thinking, even though they are heavily connected to the dollar and their economy has grown as a result of tying their currency to the dollar, they're thinking that now it's time to divorce themselves from the dollar.
[01:41:36.446 --> 01:41:39.469]  It's time to kick America to the curb.
[01:41:39.469 --> 01:41:46.954]  And it's time for these other countries to stretch their wings and take over in terms of the new superpowers.
[01:41:48.476 --> 01:41:53.652]  And Robert Fisk basically makes that point in his independent article, and I can confirm
[01:41:54.651 --> 01:41:59.794]  Pretty much what he's been saying is the same thing I'm hearing here in Paris and my contacts in the Mideast.
[01:41:59.794 --> 01:42:06.718]  That, in fact, a new currency is being formulated, a new currency that will be represented by a basket of currencies.
[01:42:06.718 --> 01:42:17.184]  The only couple of things that Robert Fisk mentioned that I would add is that he mentioned that gold would be one of the components of the new currency.
[01:42:17.184 --> 01:42:22.728]  But what I'm hearing is that gold could represent as much as 50% of the basket in the new currency.
[01:42:23.388 --> 01:42:37.535]  And this is what's driving gold higher now, because banks and, you know, central banks have stopped selling their gold, and the investment banks and Wall Street and other places are starting to accumulate gold, and I think gold
[01:42:38.334 --> 01:42:38.835]  Could be.
[01:42:38.835 --> 01:42:42.038]  You know, it could go into a bubble phase.
[01:42:42.038 --> 01:42:45.421]  It could be like a dot-com bubble or a real estate bubble.
[01:42:45.421 --> 01:42:50.727]  You know, they need a bubble in America to keep things rolling on Wall Street, to keep the bonuses flowing.
[01:42:50.727 --> 01:42:54.230]  And people have been questioning, what is going to be the next bubble?
[01:42:54.230 --> 01:42:55.691]  Is it going to be carbon credits?
[01:42:55.691 --> 01:42:56.993]  Is it going to be green investment?
[01:42:57.453 --> 01:42:59.915]  Green investment is going to be commodity investment.
[01:42:59.915 --> 01:43:01.496]  It's going to be gold.
[01:43:01.496 --> 01:43:03.938]  And gold could be a huge bubble.
[01:43:03.938 --> 01:43:05.359]  You could see the price spike.
[01:43:05.359 --> 01:43:09.202]  You could see the price go to $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 an ounce.
[01:43:09.202 --> 01:43:17.748]  If that's what Goldman Sachs and these guys decide, it's going to be the next gravy train for their big bonuses.
[01:43:17.748 --> 01:43:24.453]  And I'm hearing some other things in Europe, some really interesting things, which I've been...
[01:43:27.275 --> 01:43:28.215]  Hold on a minute.
[01:43:28.215 --> 01:43:29.135]  Hold on, Max.
[01:43:29.135 --> 01:43:31.696]  Max, I want to hear your inside info.
[01:43:31.696 --> 01:43:34.597]  You hinted at that yesterday on international television.
[01:43:34.597 --> 01:43:39.438]  I'd like you to, because I know you don't make stuff up, give us entree into your inside info.
[01:43:39.438 --> 01:43:40.778]  We'd really appreciate it.
[01:43:40.778 --> 01:43:46.859]  All those investors and people out there that want to know what's happening, because you are there in that major crossroads of Paris.
[01:43:46.859 --> 01:43:51.760]  But before we get to that, you know, there's something larger going on here.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.101]  I read Club of Rome and UN documents and Rockefeller documents 15 years ago.
[01:43:56.983 --> 01:44:00.546]  That they'd written years before that, you know, 20 years ago.
[01:44:00.546 --> 01:44:12.635]  That they plan to use the U.S., use us as a military to set up world government, then blame everything on us, implode the dollar, and bring in a new bank-to-bank currency, and then have regional currencies.
[01:44:12.635 --> 01:44:25.245]  They don't want to have one global currency that they manipulate and play the markets on a global scale so there's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, and that now Russia and China are basically owned and controlled by these interests, and that the U.S.
[01:44:25.825 --> 01:44:36.588]  Is just having all the debt piled on it, and that they're preparing to kind of seal the deal, or swap spit, or become blood brothers by torturing the U.S.
[01:44:36.588 --> 01:44:38.369]  into third world-dom.
[01:44:38.369 --> 01:44:42.810]  And so that China and Russia and the Middle East shouldn't be celebrating so much.
[01:44:42.810 --> 01:44:43.570]  Sure, the U.S.
[01:44:43.570 --> 01:44:50.553]  is the drunk husband that comes home every night and cold cocks them, but they're getting out of bed with the U.S.
[01:44:50.553 --> 01:44:51.953]  and getting in bed with Beelzebub.
[01:44:53.772 --> 01:44:55.913]  Well, I mean, break it down very simply.
[01:44:55.913 --> 01:45:01.137]  It's very simple to put in the following terms.
[01:45:01.137 --> 01:45:04.999]  75% of all the transactions in the world take place in U.S.
[01:45:04.999 --> 01:45:05.700]  dollars.
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:08.782]  It is the world's reserve currency.
[01:45:08.782 --> 01:45:11.364]  And that's the way it's been since the end of World War II.
[01:45:11.364 --> 01:45:15.806]  And it is the basis of America's hegemony around the world.
[01:45:15.806 --> 01:45:17.928]  And it's, you know, America has a soft empire.
[01:45:18.548 --> 01:45:19.849]  Uh, as well as the hard empire.
[01:45:19.849 --> 01:45:25.053]  I mean, they have, of course, their embassies, and they have, uh, their facilities all over the world.
[01:45:25.053 --> 01:45:32.077]  Uh, but the dollar has really been the means by which they have, uh, the major influence around the world.
[01:45:32.077 --> 01:45:40.663]  And, uh, you know, what these, what these countries like Russia and China and Iran, of course, signed the Shanghai Cooperative Organization.
[01:45:40.663 --> 01:45:44.506]  The SCO, if you look that up on Google, you'll find out all about it.
[01:45:44.506 --> 01:45:46.207]  They have a mutual defense pact.
[01:45:46.207 --> 01:45:47.608]  If America hits Iran,
[01:45:48.708 --> 01:45:54.393]  China and Russia have pledged to side with Iran and strike back, basically.
[01:45:54.393 --> 01:45:56.734]  So, it's just economics.
[01:45:56.734 --> 01:46:03.739]  China has a deal with Iran for $8 billion in oil, and America seems addicted to war to feed their machine.
[01:46:03.739 --> 01:46:06.401]  You know, last year, 2008, Alex, the U.S.
[01:46:06.401 --> 01:46:15.648]  collected about $2.5 trillion in taxes, and 100% of that money went to two places, bailouts on Wall Street and the defense contractors.
[01:46:16.591 --> 01:46:18.072]  That's an incredible statistic.
[01:46:18.072 --> 01:46:24.857]  100% of all income tax collected last year, $2.5 trillion, went to either bailouts or military.
[01:46:24.857 --> 01:46:27.259]  There's no money going anywhere else.
[01:46:27.259 --> 01:46:34.945]  And, you know, this is just setting up the dollar as really the leper with the most fingers.
[01:46:34.945 --> 01:46:38.708]  Or I should say it's the leper with the least fingers.
[01:46:38.708 --> 01:46:43.812]  It's a currency that nobody wants anymore, and they're putting in place these other
[01:46:45.124 --> 01:46:57.493]  currencies and they're looking at gold because gold is the only way that they can have any accountability and that they can have any way of hoping to escape all of the debt-meisters that are on Wall Street.
[01:46:57.493 --> 01:47:06.380]  Yeah, not being shy-stood by the money-changers that are always creating tens of trillions in fiat money and then using it as weapons, economic and military weapons, against them.
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:12.104]  Now, the vampires of central banking, the best, the dirtiest are out of Europe and the U.S., obviously,
[01:47:13.445 --> 01:47:15.207]  China and other people play their games.
[01:47:15.207 --> 01:47:18.309]  The Arabs have their own system of banking, but they don't allow the usury.
[01:47:18.309 --> 01:47:20.792]  We're up to 30% loan sharking rates here in the U.S.
[01:47:20.792 --> 01:47:23.194]  now with the credit card population.
[01:47:23.194 --> 01:47:25.776]  So much so that people are kicking the habit and going to debit cards.
[01:47:25.776 --> 01:47:32.182]  Debit cards for Visa this week finally passed more use than credit cards, so that's something healthy out of all this.
[01:47:32.802 --> 01:47:40.886]  But will the Goldman Sachs vampires just move on after they've eaten the bones off of the United States, or are they dependent?
[01:47:40.886 --> 01:47:44.028]  I mean, is this their Transylvanian Earth?
[01:47:44.028 --> 01:47:54.033]  Is England, Israel, the United States, Germany, France, is that Count Dracula's Earth that he can go anywhere, but he's got to haul those caskets around?
[01:47:54.033 --> 01:47:56.774]  I mean, is there any way to kill the vampire?
[01:47:56.774 --> 01:47:57.755]  With a silver spike.
[01:48:00.265 --> 01:48:00.786]  I don't know.
[01:48:18.341 --> 01:48:39.851]  If everyone bought one ounce of gold bullion, and the price traded immediately up to its inflation-adjusted normal price of $2,000 an ounce, it would remove 90% of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan's ability to spin cotton canning derivatives out of, you know, pulling it out of their backsides and claiming that this has some validity in the market.
[01:48:40.431 --> 01:48:47.593]  And that's why they just hate gold and that's why they've done everything since Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner.
[01:48:47.593 --> 01:48:57.736]  All their rhetoric, all their white papers, all their doctoral dissertations have all been about the greatness of fiat currency and fractional reserve banking and why gold is dead.
[01:48:57.736 --> 01:48:59.157]  Now what's happening, now let me get into this.
[01:48:59.597 --> 01:49:05.323]  What's happening is that these countries that are gold, that are petroleum exporters, are saying enough is enough.
[01:49:05.323 --> 01:49:10.649]  We don't care what the risks are at this point because we're sick of America's wars.
[01:49:10.649 --> 01:49:12.611]  We're sick of all the market manipulation.
[01:49:12.611 --> 01:49:16.214]  We're sick of Goldman Sachs manipulating the Comex and the NYMEX.
[01:49:16.214 --> 01:49:18.477]  We're just going to introduce our own basket, our own currency.
[01:49:18.477 --> 01:49:19.978]  We're going to put gold in there.
[01:49:19.978 --> 01:49:21.840]  It'll be the first gold-backed currency.
[01:49:23.962 --> 01:49:25.464]  Since 1971, when the U.S.
[01:49:25.464 --> 01:49:35.675]  dollar still had some tenuous connection to gold, but there really hasn't been a gold... But Max, the last time they did that, the globalists blew the hell out of Iraq, saying they had WMDs.
[01:49:35.675 --> 01:49:41.541]  Now the Arabs are getting ready to do it again, and notice, they found secret reactors that the Easter Bunny laid.
[01:49:43.294 --> 01:49:44.054]  Well, yeah, of course.
[01:49:44.054 --> 01:49:52.059]  You know, Iraq said that they wanted to start trading oil in Euros, and the next thing you know, we're shocked and awed.
[01:49:52.059 --> 01:50:00.884]  And then Iran started saying, we want to trade our oil in Euros, and suddenly, you know, the game was moved over to Iran.
[01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:06.406]  But here's what I'm hearing, and this is kind of the interesting story, if you will.
[01:50:06.406 --> 01:50:11.971]  You know, Stacy Herbert and I made a really interesting film a couple years ago about gold.
[01:50:11.971 --> 01:50:15.654]  And we interviewed folks over at the Bundesbank in Germany.
[01:50:15.654 --> 01:50:23.582]  And at that time, it was revealed to us, anyway, that there are 3,000 tons of gold.
[01:50:23.582 --> 01:50:28.006]  Much of it was held outside of Germany and held, in fact, in the United States.
[01:50:28.593 --> 01:50:36.055]  What I'm hearing now, Alex, is that Germany, like France did back in the 60s, they're gonna demand their gold bullion delivered to them.
[01:50:36.055 --> 01:50:37.216]  The physical gold.
[01:50:37.216 --> 01:50:46.779]  You know, back in the 60s, De Gaulle sent ships, warships, to New York and forced America to put their gold, France's gold, onto a ship.
[01:50:46.779 --> 01:50:47.239]  Stay there!
[01:50:47.699 --> 01:50:48.419]  Back to Europe.
[01:51:01.018 --> 01:51:04.580]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:14.185]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[01:51:14.185 --> 01:51:21.049]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[01:51:21.269 --> 01:51:34.779]  If you are ready to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.
[01:51:34.779 --> 01:51:40.583]  Here is what one satisfied customer had to say about Heart and Body Extract regarding his angina pain.
[01:51:40.583 --> 01:51:43.765]  I haven't had an angina pain since I've been on it.
[01:51:43.765 --> 01:51:46.127]  The Heart and Body Extract is just so great.
[01:51:46.127 --> 01:51:50.930]  I thank God that I was led to this product that's doing so much for me, and that can do so much for other people.
[01:51:51.190 --> 01:51:55.153]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:51:55.153 --> 01:51:56.434]  And we knew what to do.
[01:51:56.434 --> 01:51:57.674]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:51:57.674 --> 01:52:03.018]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:03.018 --> 01:52:03.478]  Whitman!
[01:52:18.951 --> 01:52:26.293]  EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:26.293 --> 01:52:33.394]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:33.394 --> 01:52:36.555]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:36.555 --> 01:52:41.676]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:42.336 --> 01:52:45.399]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:52:45.399 --> 01:52:51.464]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:52:51.464 --> 01:52:54.387]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:54.387 --> 01:52:59.331]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:53:00.677 --> 01:53:04.418]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guide.
[01:53:04.418 --> 01:53:11.581]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[01:53:11.581 --> 01:53:16.603]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[01:53:16.883 --> 01:53:18.825]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[01:53:18.825 --> 01:53:25.451]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[01:53:25.451 --> 01:53:30.416]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[01:53:30.416 --> 01:53:38.664]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[01:53:39.725 --> 01:53:46.588]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[01:53:46.588 --> 01:53:51.611]  Comparably, the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.

[01:54:04.079 --> 01:54:05.060]  Don't worry.
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:07.081]  This show is documented.
[01:54:07.081 --> 01:54:12.924]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:12.924 --> 01:54:15.765]  Max Keiser is going to be with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:15.765 --> 01:54:18.827]  Then Alan Watt, last hour and a half.
[01:54:18.827 --> 01:54:20.868]  And he's going to have a lot to talk about.
[01:54:20.868 --> 01:54:25.310]  By the way, Alan Watt is one of the central figures along with Max Keiser.
[01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:27.532]  One of our experts in Fall of the Republic.
[01:54:27.532 --> 01:54:29.773]  This has twice the budget of any film ever made.
[01:54:30.874 --> 01:54:32.237]  200 grand.
[01:54:32.237 --> 01:54:33.038]  That's a lot for me.
[01:54:33.038 --> 01:54:37.104]  I know it's not for some people, but boy, I'm risking a lot doing this.
[01:54:37.104 --> 01:54:39.007]  And I did 17 interviews.
[01:54:39.007 --> 01:54:40.370]  I've been with people on aircraft 17 times.
[01:54:43.739 --> 01:54:44.459]  That's a lot for us.
[01:54:44.459 --> 01:54:47.262]  The point is, this is a whole new quantum leap.
[01:54:47.262 --> 01:54:49.284]  People are seeing the trailers and getting that idea.
[01:54:49.284 --> 01:54:51.586]  Now, we premiered a general trailer yesterday.
[01:54:51.586 --> 01:54:55.290]  We have a TV Mind Control trailer premiering next hour.
[01:54:55.290 --> 01:54:57.832]  Max Keiser will be with us and he'll talk about that.
[01:54:57.832 --> 01:55:02.236]  Also, some things he's doing on the film end at his PirateMyFilm.com site.
[01:55:02.236 --> 01:55:07.942]  But I wanted to just, at least once today, tell listeners, you can pre-order Fall of the Republic.
[01:55:08.894 --> 01:55:12.857]  And we're getting these in a few days before the 21st when it officially comes out.
[01:55:12.857 --> 01:55:15.539]  And we're shipping the orders in the order they're received.
[01:55:15.539 --> 01:55:17.341]  We've hired extra shipping people.
[01:55:17.341 --> 01:55:23.266]  We're gonna try to ship all the back orders out by the 21st or a few days after that.
[01:55:23.266 --> 01:55:27.149]  We're really hustling to get these DVDs via UPS worldwide.
[01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:28.950]  It has a zero country code.
[01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:29.971]  Plays everywhere in the world.
[01:55:29.971 --> 01:55:33.354]  I keep getting emails asking that we should put a note on the shopping cart.
[01:55:33.874 --> 01:55:36.014]  Explaining that, I forgot to tell folks to do that.
[01:55:36.014 --> 01:55:38.935]  Yes, all our DVDs are country code zero, play everywhere.
[01:55:38.935 --> 01:55:43.176]  And you're also supporting us when you buy Fall of the Republic.
[01:55:43.176 --> 01:55:53.518]  But it's two hours, 24 minutes long, it's a big Alex Jones film, and it has another 25 minutes of extras, it's a DVD nine, so close to three hours on this baby.
[01:55:53.518 --> 01:55:57.559]  Fall of the Republic, InfoWars.com, if you want to support an alternative film.
[01:55:57.559 --> 01:56:01.240]  This shows who the bankers are, how they're operating, what they're doing, how to stop them.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.262]  And Max, just briefly, because I want to get into what it will look like as the dollar dies in the different scenarios.
[01:56:08.262 --> 01:56:10.103]  You're saying it's baked into the cake.
[01:56:10.103 --> 01:56:10.743]  It's going to happen.
[01:56:10.743 --> 01:56:15.004]  And then more of that inside info about the gold missing.
[01:56:15.004 --> 01:56:16.665]  And you said ComEx would default.
[01:56:16.665 --> 01:56:19.765]  We've seen some big gold suppliers have been defaulting.
[01:56:19.765 --> 01:56:23.307]  Your crystal ball is really firing on all eight cylinders here.
[01:56:23.307 --> 01:56:24.167]  But briefly, you've seen...
[01:56:24.767 --> 01:56:29.650]  It's a brilliant trailer, and I think the part that I'm in is especially brilliant, I must say.
[01:56:49.554 --> 01:57:02.410]  Yeah, no, I think your last film, The Obama Deception, you know, that came during a time when I was still, you know, basically at one foot in the Obama camp.
[01:57:02.410 --> 01:57:05.654]  And now I have both feet out of the Obama camp.
[01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:21.097]  Uh, you know, that was really a bold, uh, film to make at the time because a lot of people were still in love with Obama, and he had, uh, really hypnotized everybody into thinking that he was really different than the preceding nightmare in the White House.
[01:57:21.097 --> 01:57:23.499]  And, uh, you know, I was half-fooled, I must say.
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:28.082]  Now you're this film for all the Republic, I think it's going to take it further.
[01:57:28.082 --> 01:57:35.847]  I think, you know, it's interesting, Alex, is that I think your film is going to be a lot more hard-hitting than that Michael Moore film, Capitalism, A Love Story.
[01:57:35.847 --> 01:57:40.370]  I think he's kind of a cream puff attacking the problems.
[01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:45.374]  I think your film is going to be a lot more hard-hitting, because don't you have John Perkins in the film, the economic hitman?
[01:57:45.374 --> 01:57:46.735]  Oh yeah, we got everybody.
[01:57:46.735 --> 01:57:48.416]  John Perkins is in it.
[01:57:48.416 --> 01:57:48.596]  Yeah.
[01:57:49.617 --> 01:57:55.702]  Okay, so I think it's going to be a lot more hard-hitting, but anyway, getting back to the dollar, you know, the U.S.
[01:57:55.702 --> 01:58:04.869]  dollar, these countries, the oil exporters, they want to get out, they want to get another currency to compete, basically, with the U.S.
[01:58:04.869 --> 01:58:11.174]  Their objective, quite simply, is to, they want to, they're being competitive, they want to put the U.S.
[01:58:11.174 --> 01:58:13.736]  economy out of business, which means that they want to put the U.S.
[01:58:13.736 --> 01:58:16.659]  dollar out of business, and they can do so because
[01:58:17.899 --> 01:58:32.765]  This new era is an era that's going to be dominated by countries that actually have resources, and we're talking about oil, we're talking about natural resources, and those countries that have been living on creating mortgage-backed, collateralized debt obligations.
[01:58:32.765 --> 01:58:38.948]  All right, stay there, because the last break interrupted you on the missing gold and de Gaulle, then you went back on the dollar.
[01:58:38.948 --> 01:58:41.249]  Let's come back in one minute.
[01:58:41.249 --> 01:58:46.071]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:49.052 --> 01:58:54.856]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.856 --> 01:58:56.857]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.857 --> 01:59:05.383]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.383 --> 01:59:10.947]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.947 --> 01:59:12.568]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.788 --> 01:59:19.314]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.314 --> 01:59:30.364]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.364 --> 01:59:31.145]  That's right.
[01:59:31.145 --> 01:59:33.707]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.707 --> 01:59:35.288]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:59:37.230 --> 01:59:37.670]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.798 --> 02:00:08.565]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.565 --> 02:00:10.331]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.331 --> 02:00:11.897]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.897 --> 02:00:12.680]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.442 --> 02:00:17.625]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.625 --> 02:00:22.449]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.449 --> 02:00:24.531]  Okay, this is a short five-minute segment.
[02:00:24.531 --> 02:00:27.713]  We got a 13-minute segment with Max coming up and then he's gone.
[02:00:27.713 --> 02:00:30.395]  So I want to try to shut up here because the breaks keep breaking things up.
[02:00:30.395 --> 02:00:32.997]  We have a lot of breaks at the end of the hour and the start of the hour.
[02:00:32.997 --> 02:00:34.358]  That's the standard radio clock.
[02:00:34.358 --> 02:00:36.180]  Don't tell me it doesn't make any sense, but...
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:41.163]  The point is, Max, you were trying to get into De Gaulle demanding the gold.
[02:00:41.163 --> 02:00:44.666]  A year or two ago, you broke that there was missing gold.
[02:00:44.666 --> 02:00:45.967]  Now that's mainstream media.
[02:00:45.967 --> 02:00:48.689]  You talked about defaults.
[02:00:48.689 --> 02:00:50.150]  You're going on with gold producers.
[02:00:50.150 --> 02:00:51.471]  That's now happening.
[02:00:51.471 --> 02:00:54.454]  Kind of a train wreck as demand spikes.
[02:00:54.454 --> 02:01:00.619]  Then let's get into that inside info that you keep trying to get into about the dollar and more of what's really going on with the Arabs.
[02:01:00.619 --> 02:01:05.583]  And you're saying a faster timetable than the one we've been hearing about of five years.
[02:01:05.583 --> 02:01:05.883]  Go ahead.
[02:01:06.846 --> 02:01:17.332]  Yeah, well, okay, you know, getting back to the Gulf, in the 60s, over there in France, you know, France demanded that the U.S.
[02:01:17.332 --> 02:01:22.575]  return the gold that was held on deposit in New York, and they forced the U.S.
[02:01:22.575 --> 02:01:29.820]  to do so, and then Britain, because France was very nervous about the way that the U.S.
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:33.042]  was going in heavily into debt to pay for the Vietnam War.
[02:01:34.463 --> 02:01:44.830]  And so then Britain was next in line to start demanding their gold, and then at that point, 1971, Nixon said, no, no, we're going to close the gold window.
[02:01:44.830 --> 02:02:00.340]  And this was the beginning, really, of the era of fiat currencies, and the beginning, really, of the era of derivatives, because shortly thereafter in Chicago, they started trading options based on the black and shawl option derivative volatility formula.
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:12.307]  And you have now the modern era of derivatives, which is an era of making money from transactions and not making money from actually doing anything like would resemble business.
[02:02:12.307 --> 02:02:17.570]  And this has led to incredible booms and incredible busts that we've had ever since then.
[02:02:18.476 --> 02:02:20.899]  You've got just a flash forward to modern times.
[02:02:20.899 --> 02:02:27.667]  You have the dot-com boom, the real estate, and then crash, the real estate boom and crash, and now the banking boom and crash.
[02:02:27.667 --> 02:02:34.034]  And now these countries that are emerging like Russia, China, Iran are saying, we know what's going on here.
[02:02:34.034 --> 02:02:34.515]  The U.S.
[02:02:34.515 --> 02:02:38.259]  is simply printing up lots of phony baloney money to pay for their debts.
[02:02:38.859 --> 02:02:45.723]  And this is not what we're going to be on board for because we're using all this money also to finance your wars.
[02:02:45.723 --> 02:02:54.587]  So the one way we're going to stop you from financing wars... It's basically the way that Iran, China, and Russia are going to stop America from invading Iran is they're going to crash the dollar.
[02:02:55.242 --> 02:02:57.643]  I mean, that's global financial warfare.
[02:02:57.643 --> 02:02:59.203]  They don't have to fire a shot.
[02:02:59.203 --> 02:03:00.984]  They don't have to fire a missile.
[02:03:00.984 --> 02:03:02.244]  They're going to crash the dollar.
[02:03:02.244 --> 02:03:04.825]  And that's going to put American military and America out of business.
[02:03:04.825 --> 02:03:06.166]  That's the game plan.
[02:03:06.166 --> 02:03:08.106]  And Germany knows this.
[02:03:08.106 --> 02:03:14.389]  And Germany is very nervous because they've got something like 3,000, up to 3,000 tons of their gold held in New York.
[02:03:14.389 --> 02:03:15.989]  But didn't they just ask for that?
[02:03:15.989 --> 02:03:17.970]  Didn't they just start asking for the gold a few months ago?
[02:03:18.729 --> 02:03:20.471]  They're starting to make rumors.
[02:03:20.471 --> 02:03:24.154]  They're starting to make these requests.
[02:03:24.154 --> 02:03:27.538]  They're putting out a feeler to see how the U.S.
[02:03:27.538 --> 02:03:29.159]  is going to respond.
[02:03:29.159 --> 02:03:30.641]  It's suicide for the U.S.
[02:03:30.641 --> 02:03:38.268]  to attack around because it's going to implode the dollar and it's going to force countries like Germany to demand all their gold bullion back from New York.
[02:03:38.268 --> 02:03:40.371]  Tim Geithner's old bank, the New York Fed.
[02:03:41.650 --> 02:03:55.024]  And they're going to show up, and they're going to demand their gold bullion, and gold bullion is going to skyrocket, and all these banks are going to be completely put out of their fiat currency, money-spinning games, and they're going to have another huge down leg in markets.
[02:03:55.024 --> 02:03:57.507]  But this is a matter of... Max, I have a quick question.
[02:03:57.927 --> 02:03:58.908]  Robert Fisk talking about it.
[02:03:58.908 --> 02:04:01.449]  Robert Fisk in his article for The Independent.
[02:04:01.449 --> 02:04:03.391]  You know, Robert Fisk is a great journalist.
[02:04:03.391 --> 02:04:11.116]  He's talking about the gold-producing countries, I'm sorry, the oil-producing exporting countries are going to start trading oil in dollars.
[02:04:11.116 --> 02:04:19.162]  And what I would add to that is you've got now Germany in response to the chaos that's going to result in terms of the dollars going to demand.
[02:04:19.842 --> 02:04:22.584]  We made that film, Alex, it's on the web.
[02:04:22.584 --> 02:04:26.948]  I forget what the name of the film is, but you see me in the Bundesbank in Berlin.
[02:04:26.948 --> 02:04:34.333]  I'm talking to officials inside the Bundesbank, and we have like a hidden camera, and they're saying to us things that they, you know, revealed.
[02:04:35.974 --> 02:04:39.795]  And we're quite revealing it in terms of who owns the gold, where's the gold.
[02:04:39.795 --> 02:04:55.760]  The Gold Antitrust Action Committee put out a letter just two weeks ago which they picked up on the story and they inquired the Bundesbank to make a comment about this film and to confirm where the gold has been held.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:58.081]  There's also a movement about to audit the... Max, stay there!
[02:04:58.761 --> 02:04:59.282]  Got a break.
[02:04:59.282 --> 02:05:00.564]  We'll come back, talk about that.
[02:05:00.564 --> 02:05:03.969]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.969 --> 02:05:07.594]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.594 --> 02:05:12.161]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.161 --> 02:05:13.583]  These emergency backup systems
[02:05:13.763 --> 02:05:16.705]  We'll provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:16.705 --> 02:05:22.810]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.810 --> 02:05:26.432]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.432 --> 02:05:31.256]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.256 --> 02:05:37.820]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:39.762]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.242 --> 02:05:43.444]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:06:00.672 --> 02:06:08.417]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.417 --> 02:06:14.500]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.

[02:06:17.462 --> 02:06:23.366]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:23.726 --> 02:06:25.307]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:06:25.307 --> 02:06:27.788]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:27.788 --> 02:06:33.431]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.431 --> 02:06:35.512]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.512 --> 02:06:37.253]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.253 --> 02:06:39.794]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.794 --> 02:06:44.517]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.517 --> 02:06:48.218]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.218 --> 02:06:50.360]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:53.221]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.221 --> 02:07:00.923]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:00.923 --> 02:07:03.944]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:03.944 --> 02:07:09.266]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.266 --> 02:07:11.327]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.327 --> 02:07:16.329]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.329 --> 02:07:17.249]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.489 --> 02:07:18.610]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.610 --> 02:07:20.511]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.511 --> 02:07:21.572]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.572 --> 02:07:23.773]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.773 --> 02:07:25.114]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.114 --> 02:07:26.655]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.655 --> 02:07:31.919]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:31.919 --> 02:07:35.501]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.501 --> 02:07:38.964]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.304 --> 02:07:40.545]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.545 --> 02:07:41.446]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.446 --> 02:07:42.546]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.546 --> 02:07:43.467]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.467 --> 02:07:44.568]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.568 --> 02:07:47.630]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.630 --> 02:07:49.391]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.391 --> 02:07:50.312]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.248 --> 02:08:05.030]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:10.473]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.473 --> 02:08:15.816]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[02:08:15.816 --> 02:08:19.378]  He's recommending to me HSBC as a Global Bank British.
[02:08:20.472 --> 02:08:23.253]  I guess you don't want to be with UBS, the Patriot Act.
[02:08:23.253 --> 02:08:25.514]  They've raided that one, even if it's your money they take it.
[02:08:25.514 --> 02:08:26.834]  They just don't care.
[02:08:26.834 --> 02:08:29.195]  Gotta give everything to Goldman Sachs, the private Federal Reserve.
[02:08:29.195 --> 02:08:31.415]  They're looting everyone, invading everybody.
[02:08:31.415 --> 02:08:41.919]  Okay, Max, I want to have the world premiere here of a new trailer dealing with television mind control for Fall of the Republic, and I want to air the new trailer we aired yesterday, too.
[02:08:42.918 --> 02:08:43.959]  That you're in.
[02:08:43.959 --> 02:08:46.802]  The next week we've got another trailer on the financial section.
[02:08:46.802 --> 02:08:49.464]  It's about a third of the film that also has you in it.
[02:08:49.464 --> 02:09:01.195]  But finishing up, what will it look like through a gradual death of the dollar, you're saying it's baked into the cake to quote you, versus a fast one, and what do you see happening?
[02:09:01.195 --> 02:09:03.076]  What will the United States look like?
[02:09:03.076 --> 02:09:04.398]  How do people protect themselves?
[02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:14.981]  Well, the protection, obviously, is to be into precious metals, as I've been saying for five years.
[02:09:14.981 --> 02:09:17.204]  You know, my average cost in gold is, I think, $420 an ounce.
[02:09:19.705 --> 02:09:29.992]  And I've been saying basically the only thing I've recommended in the last four to five years is gold, gold bullion, and it's an excellent place to be as we go forward.
[02:09:29.992 --> 02:09:30.632]  Now, the U.S.
[02:09:30.632 --> 02:09:35.055]  dollar is coming under a lot of economic pressure.
[02:09:35.055 --> 02:09:40.899]  It's also coming under a lot of political pressure, and that's something that a lot of people who are pure economists are not factoring into their analysis.
[02:09:40.899 --> 02:09:44.962]  They're not factoring in the fact that the dollar has become a weapon.
[02:09:45.602 --> 02:10:00.184]  The currency market is where this World War III is being fought, and so they're looking at charts, and they're looking at analysis, and they're looking at their textbooks, but nothing in these charts and textbooks really covers when you use currencies like as a weapon.
[02:10:00.584 --> 02:10:02.786]  And that's what we're seeing happen now.
[02:10:02.786 --> 02:10:10.432]  The people in Russia, Iran, and China are saying the way we're going to stop America from invading Iran is we're going to smoke the U.S.
[02:10:10.432 --> 02:10:10.713]  dollar.
[02:10:10.713 --> 02:10:11.593]  We're going to take it down.
[02:10:11.593 --> 02:10:13.034]  We're going to crush the U.S.
[02:10:13.034 --> 02:10:14.996]  dollar, and we're going to force the U.S.
[02:10:14.996 --> 02:10:20.761]  to go into a major economic downspin as a way to engage in economic warfare.
[02:10:20.761 --> 02:10:22.923]  That's the way World War III is going to be fought.
[02:10:22.923 --> 02:10:25.425]  Now, for y'all, as I've been saying,
[02:10:26.065 --> 02:10:28.107]  Gold bullion is the place to be.
[02:10:28.107 --> 02:10:33.771]  The dollar is, at the very least, it's going to be extremely volatile.
[02:10:33.771 --> 02:10:41.037]  You're just going to start to see 10-20% moves every, you know, it can be compressed in a very short period of time.
[02:10:41.037 --> 02:10:43.158]  And that's going to be very scary for people.
[02:10:43.158 --> 02:10:54.507]  But again, if you're defensive and you've got some gold bullion, gold or silver bullion, you're going to have a, you know, that's the place to be during this period of extreme volatility.
[02:10:56.975 --> 02:10:58.436]  That the story is not different.
[02:10:58.436 --> 02:11:02.117]  The only thing different is that the timeline is being compressed.
[02:11:02.117 --> 02:11:04.999]  And things are happening a lot, you know, things are happening now.
[02:11:04.999 --> 02:11:08.720]  We're not talking about a concept that might happen in a few years.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:12.862]  We're saying right now, there are people, look at what happened the last two weeks.
[02:11:12.862 --> 02:11:21.466]  You had a G20 meeting, a G7 meeting, an international monetary fund was meeting, the UN was meeting, and they're all talking about the same thing, what to do about the dollar.
[02:11:22.066 --> 02:11:38.996]  All these guys, while the kids in America are sitting there playing with the hula hoops and, you know, the latest video games, the parents, their parents being the IMF, the World Bank, and the G7, are in the kitchen, sitting around the kitchen table deciding what to do with these kids in America and their dollar and their currency.
[02:11:38.996 --> 02:11:46.400]  So the kids are going to wake up one day and find out that, oops, Mommy and Daddy decided to devalue the dollar by 50%.
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:50.983]  Oh, I guess that means everything is going to cost twice as much, and I guess we're now in the third world.
[02:11:51.856 --> 02:11:52.616]  Oh, okay.
[02:11:52.616 --> 02:11:54.697]  But they're making those decisions right now.
[02:11:54.697 --> 02:12:03.841]  And it's tragic that the mainstream media in America is not telling the people in America what is being discussed at G7, G4, G20 right now.
[02:12:03.841 --> 02:12:09.204]  They're deciding America's future right now, in the back rooms of these meetings right now.
[02:12:09.204 --> 02:12:14.026]  And obviously, with China, Iran, and Russia, they're not
[02:12:14.904 --> 02:12:16.345]  They're not being coy about it.
[02:12:16.345 --> 02:12:18.365]  They're coming out there and they're saying, you know what?
[02:12:18.365 --> 02:12:23.327]  We're sick of you market-manipulating, you know, folks in the U.S.
[02:12:23.327 --> 02:12:24.928]  And now, you know, guns are drawn.
[02:12:24.928 --> 02:12:29.109]  We're going to start attacking this dollar, and we're going to start buying up gold aggressively.
[02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:34.692]  And Germany's caught in the middle, and they're saying, oh my God, we've got like 3,000 tons of our gold in New York.
[02:12:34.692 --> 02:12:35.692]  We want it back!
[02:12:35.692 --> 02:12:40.434]  When Germany makes that announcement, gold's going to go to, you know, it's going to have a huge move.
[02:12:40.434 --> 02:12:41.854]  By the way, let me just add this.
[02:12:41.854 --> 02:12:42.515]  CNBC
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:50.644]  Is now predicting $2,000 an ounce gold saying their charts show that.
[02:12:50.644 --> 02:12:54.747]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com, one of the top stories.
[02:12:54.747 --> 02:13:04.653]  And you've got a fraction of the public waking up that gold is important and that actually has intrinsic value and can't be devalued completely.
[02:13:04.653 --> 02:13:07.754]  And it's probably only going to go up and is going up right now.
[02:13:07.754 --> 02:13:12.037]  What is going to happen when the yuppies decide gold is cool?
[02:13:12.037 --> 02:13:13.238]  How high could it go?
[02:13:14.591 --> 02:13:18.714]  Well, that's what I was talking to at the top of the show.
[02:13:18.714 --> 02:13:41.970]  If, in fact, the powers that be on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, if they figure out that the easiest bubble to try to inflate to pay themselves huge Christmas bonuses this year or next year, if they decide it's gold, then it could go... Really, as we used to say at Wall Street, there is no top.
[02:13:44.625 --> 02:13:47.226]  So it's going to be like Google stock going from $20 to $500?
[02:13:47.226 --> 02:13:49.287]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:49.287 --> 02:14:05.816]  You know, when I was working on Wall Street, I worked on Wall Street in one capacity or another during the boom of the 80s, during the dot-com of the 90s, and you know, you had in the 90s the dot-com stocks that would go public at $16 and trade to $300.
[02:14:07.228 --> 02:14:10.171]  And then they return back to, you know, 16 again.
[02:14:10.171 --> 02:14:19.720]  But, so, gold could be, if they decide that gold, and it hasn't been in a bear market up until just the past few years.
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:22.643]  During the entire bull market, Wall Street started in 1982.
[02:14:24.364 --> 02:14:39.929]  Gold just went down every single year because nobody wanted it, and it was being trashed by all the central banks who were selling gold to buy T-bills to use as collateral to create collateralized debt obligations and credit default flops, and this huge Ponzi scheme that became the U.S.
[02:14:39.929 --> 02:14:49.632]  and global market that hit the skids in the summer of 2007 when Chuck Prince, CEO of the Citigroup, said, you know, as long as the music's playing, we're going to keep dancing.
[02:14:49.632 --> 02:14:50.672]  And then that week,
[02:14:51.272 --> 02:14:58.779]  The DNP came out of the report saying, our hedge funds have a lot of junk bonds in there and we don't think the value is 100 cents on the dollar.
[02:14:58.779 --> 02:15:00.480]  We think it's 0 cents on the dollar.
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:05.765]  And that was the beginning of what we now know as the financial crisis that we're all suffering from today.
[02:15:05.765 --> 02:15:17.075]  Now, there was an attempt back in the latter part of last year to inject $12 or $13 trillion worth of new loans into the economy, and you're seeing the stock market bounce.
[02:15:18.075 --> 02:15:43.484]  And you're seeing some quote-unquote green shoots, but now that all these stimulus packages have ended, the clunkers, cash for clunkers, etc., now we're going back to reality, when the reality is that all that Obama and these guys did was just layer another few trillion dollars worth of debt on top of the debt layer cake, and the whole thing is just, it didn't stop it from collapsing, and we'll go right back to where we were last year and the year before.
[02:15:43.484 --> 02:15:46.065]  By the end, within six months, there's going to be banks
[02:15:46.685 --> 02:15:53.049]  Going to Congress saying, if you don't give us another five trillion dollars, we're going to do another, we're going to do a suicide mission, we're going to blow ourselves up.
[02:15:53.049 --> 02:15:58.193]  Which is what Paulson did, if you remember, he said, give us 700 billion dollars, we're going to blow up this entire economy.
[02:15:58.193 --> 02:16:06.318]  He was like one of these suicide bombers, and for our Congress, he strapped on like five trillion dollars worth of derivative contracts, and he was going to explode in everyone's face.
[02:16:06.318 --> 02:16:09.240]  And now, you know, that's going to come again.
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:11.842]  So, you know, the point being that
[02:16:12.372 --> 02:16:14.733]  The rest of the world is saying, hold on.
[02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:16.634]  We've seen this movie before.
[02:16:16.634 --> 02:16:20.176]  We don't want to play this game anymore.
[02:16:20.176 --> 02:16:21.117]  We've got the oil.
[02:16:21.117 --> 02:16:22.298]  You don't have the oil.
[02:16:22.298 --> 02:16:38.567]  Plus, you know, a lot of these countries are dealing with the fact that, you know, I don't know if you've followed this or not, Alex, but, you know, I think it may go against some of your orthodoxy, but the fact is, in countries like Mexico, which is one of the three biggest oil fields in the world, Cantero,
[02:16:39.347 --> 02:16:40.207]  Well, you're certainly right!
[02:16:56.014 --> 02:17:02.359]  You're certainly right there's six and a half going on seven million people and you're gonna have fights over fewer and fewer resources.
[02:17:02.359 --> 02:17:08.885]  There is a lot of oil and stuff but it's still a big job to find it and get it out and you're absolutely right there's pressure everywhere.
[02:17:08.885 --> 02:17:22.356]  Max I'm gonna come back and play the new trailer because I know you've got to go but before we end you were telling me you've got a new project first time I heard of this at your PirateMyFilm.com website?
[02:17:23.136 --> 02:17:23.837]  Oh, yeah.
[02:17:23.837 --> 02:17:30.520]  Well, prior to my film, my website is anybody can list a movie and try to raise money for their movie.
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:31.701]  And I've got a few movies listed.
[02:17:31.701 --> 02:17:33.482]  I've got a movie called Where's Kenny Boy?
[02:17:33.482 --> 02:17:39.165]  I'm going to try to go down to Paraguay and find Ken Lay, because I think he's still alive and living down in Paraguay.
[02:17:39.165 --> 02:17:41.586]  I also have a movie called Baltimore Jihad.
[02:17:41.586 --> 02:17:44.248]  It's about who made the most money with options on 9-11.
[02:17:45.439 --> 02:17:51.203]  And I got a story going down to Baltimore, Maryland, and talking to the bankers who made all the money on 9-11 trading options.
[02:17:51.203 --> 02:17:53.885]  So that's a project called Baltimore Jihad.
[02:17:53.885 --> 02:18:00.510]  Then, I've got a new project called Alex the Wonderland, and it's a fantasy project.
[02:18:00.510 --> 02:18:06.774]  It's about the mainstream media in America suddenly adopts Alex Jones as their mainstream media outlet.
[02:18:07.595 --> 02:18:16.832]  And what would happen if suddenly mainstream media started to take on what you've been saying now for 14 years and adopting it as the main message?
[02:18:19.692 --> 02:18:41.069]  What gave me the big idea was the Hardin, Montana story, because to me, that is the first major story to leap from Alex Jones to mainstream, and not the first, but I'm saying it's a huge story that went from Alex Jones and InfoWars to mainstream media in a huge way.
[02:18:41.069 --> 02:18:45.673]  So this is a little project I'm putting together, and it's about how mainstream media goes Alex Jones.
[02:18:46.906 --> 02:18:54.052]  Well, I'm honored, and I think that'll make a good film, but I think the Where's Kenny Boyle will be even more interesting, because no doubt they staged that death.
[02:18:54.052 --> 02:18:55.153]  Max, that is exciting.
[02:18:55.153 --> 02:18:58.435]  As that develops, we will have you back on MaxKaiser.com.
[02:18:58.435 --> 02:19:04.140]  Say hi to your lovely betrothed, and I will talk to you.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:04.540]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:04.660]  Here.
[02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:06.122]  She wants to say hello.
[02:19:06.122 --> 02:19:07.563]  She'll say hello.
[02:19:07.563 --> 02:19:08.203]  Say hello.
[02:19:08.203 --> 02:19:08.423]  Hello.
[02:19:08.423 --> 02:19:09.885]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:19:09.885 --> 02:19:10.465]  Very well.
[02:19:10.465 --> 02:19:11.406]  How are you?
[02:19:11.406 --> 02:19:11.786]  Good, good.
[02:19:11.786 --> 02:19:16.270]  We should have... For those that don't know, tell folks who you are as we go to break here.
[02:19:17.122 --> 02:19:20.284]  I'm Stacey Herbert, partner with Max Geyser.
[02:19:20.284 --> 02:19:28.388]  And you guys work on the TV shows and radio shows together, and I always enjoy hearing you when you do all the great work you're doing, Stacey.
[02:19:28.388 --> 02:19:31.510]  Thank you.
[02:19:31.510 --> 02:19:33.871]  Well, I'm excited to hear about this Alex in Wonderland.
[02:19:33.871 --> 02:19:35.472]  I already feel like I'm in Wonderland every day.
[02:19:35.472 --> 02:19:36.312]  The world's so weird.
[02:19:36.312 --> 02:19:42.676]  Yes, and I'm excited to go to Paraguay for the Kenny Boy story.
[02:19:42.676 --> 02:19:43.696]  I am very excited.
[02:19:43.696 --> 02:19:44.857]  Maybe I'll go to Paraguay with you.
[02:19:47.994 --> 02:19:49.015]  Sure, yeah.
[02:19:49.015 --> 02:19:49.996]  I'm real tough.
[02:19:49.996 --> 02:19:51.997]  Alright Stacey, keep it up over there.
[02:19:51.997 --> 02:19:53.258]  Take care of Max for me.
[02:19:53.258 --> 02:19:54.539]  I know he's a handful.
[02:19:54.539 --> 02:19:54.719]  Someday.
[02:20:01.357 --> 02:20:08.882]  AaronAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.

[02:20:17.688 --> 02:20:22.449]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?

[02:20:42.535 --> 02:20:46.818]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:20:46.818 --> 02:20:49.819]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:10.683 --> 02:21:12.225]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.225 --> 02:21:13.025]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:13.025 --> 02:21:14.026]  This is his M.O.s.
[02:21:14.026 --> 02:21:15.388]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:15.388 --> 02:21:17.390]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.390 --> 02:21:24.537]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:24.537 --> 02:21:25.018]  Some U.S.
[02:21:25.018 --> 02:21:30.704]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.344 --> 02:21:34.865]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:34.865 --> 02:21:37.666]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:01.795 --> 02:22:02.816]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:02.816 --> 02:22:08.359]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:08.359 --> 02:22:08.899]  I get it.
[02:22:08.899 --> 02:22:18.525]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:18.525 --> 02:22:19.686]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:19.926 --> 02:22:28.394]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:28.394 --> 02:22:31.797]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:31.797 --> 02:22:36.061]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:36.061 --> 02:22:37.663]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:37.663 --> 02:22:41.626]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:41.626 --> 02:22:45.230]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:45.430 --> 02:22:46.331]  You should, too.
[02:22:46.331 --> 02:22:47.472]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:47.472 --> 02:22:50.855]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:50.855 --> 02:22:51.096]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.096 --> 02:22:51.196]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.196 --> 02:22:51.376]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.365 --> 02:23:05.247]  Berkey water systems are the most trusted name in water filtration available on the market.

[02:23:53.451 --> 02:23:54.852]  They railed against the crown, another rag-tag band.
[02:24:19.514 --> 02:24:27.557]  They laid their bodies down.
[02:24:27.557 --> 02:24:29.017]  That's why we have the Second Amendment.
[02:24:29.017 --> 02:24:35.099]  That's why we have private property.
[02:24:35.099 --> 02:24:38.460]  Thanks to their blood, and their sweat, and their tears.
[02:24:38.460 --> 02:24:39.721]  Thanks to their will.
[02:24:39.721 --> 02:24:40.721]  I am still free today!
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:51.241]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[02:24:51.241 --> 02:24:58.803]  There's always tyrants that put on uniforms, get power, set up phony courts, and take over.
[02:24:58.803 --> 02:25:00.384]  They've always got excuses.
[02:25:14.679 --> 02:25:15.880]  It's happening again.
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:18.222]  Does that mean everybody in the military and police are bad?
[02:25:18.222 --> 02:25:19.023]  No.
[02:25:19.023 --> 02:25:23.727]  It means the people running the systems and writing the laws are thugs.
[02:25:23.727 --> 02:25:26.369]  Congress is criminal.
[02:25:26.369 --> 02:25:33.616]  The vast majority of them pass bills, vote on bills they've never read.
[02:25:33.616 --> 02:25:37.759]  And all of us are guilty for not standing up and saying no.
[02:25:37.759 --> 02:25:39.621]  And all of us are in the same boat together.
[02:25:41.704 --> 02:25:43.125]  99.9%!
[02:25:43.125 --> 02:25:45.829]  Here's yesterday's new trailer, the big general trailer.
[02:25:45.829 --> 02:25:48.693]  When we get Alan Watt on in the next segment, I'll play the trailer.
[02:25:48.693 --> 02:25:50.255]  It's on TV Mind Control.
[02:25:50.255 --> 02:25:51.456]  It's got a lot of Alan in it.
[02:25:52.458 --> 02:25:54.959]  But here is the big new trailer.
[02:25:54.959 --> 02:25:58.601]  We're asking you to have this trailer go mega viral everywhere.
[02:25:58.601 --> 02:26:01.082]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:26:01.082 --> 02:26:04.044]  You can find all the trailers, all three of the new trailers.
[02:26:04.044 --> 02:26:10.607]  There's the original, one yesterday, and now there's a new one today, another one next week, and then one more final one right before it comes out.
[02:26:10.607 --> 02:26:12.968]  It's such a big film, so many subjects.
[02:26:12.968 --> 02:26:14.809]  Here is yesterday's new trailer.
[02:26:22.054 --> 02:26:26.838]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:26:26.838 --> 02:26:30.841]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:26:30.841 --> 02:26:35.664]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:26:35.664 --> 02:26:41.929]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:26:43.698 --> 02:26:48.905]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[02:26:48.905 --> 02:26:55.773]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:26:55.773 --> 02:26:59.979]  One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes.
[02:27:04.573 --> 02:27:06.914]  I have a question for this young man.
[02:27:06.914 --> 02:27:09.114]  He has the right to be represented.
[02:27:09.114 --> 02:27:21.338]  It's up to every man, woman, and child in the United States to decide whether we're going to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers, or whether we're going to restore the republic.
[02:27:21.338 --> 02:27:26.359]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today it seems like nobody does care.
[02:27:26.359 --> 02:27:31.040]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:27:36.101 --> 02:27:38.143]  Who's going to soak up the derivatives?
[02:27:38.143 --> 02:27:39.704]  Who's going to soak up the debt?
[02:27:39.704 --> 02:27:41.485]  Who's going to be penalized?
[02:27:41.485 --> 02:27:51.713]  Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[02:27:51.713 --> 02:27:52.153]  I don't know.
[02:27:52.153 --> 02:27:59.078]  Do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that provision of the Constitution to hand out half a trillion dollars to foreigners?
[02:27:59.078 --> 02:28:02.220]  Will we choose liberty or will we choose tyranny?
[02:28:02.220 --> 02:28:04.282]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[02:28:04.738 --> 02:28:06.599]  You don't have a president.
[02:28:06.599 --> 02:28:07.680]  You have an actor.
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:08.840]  Tim Geithner?
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:09.201]  Bernanke?
[02:28:09.201 --> 02:28:10.341]  They're arsonists!
[02:28:10.341 --> 02:28:12.262]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:28:12.262 --> 02:28:14.644]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:28:14.644 --> 02:28:16.545]  Who do we sell these matches to?
[02:28:16.545 --> 02:28:22.448]  The last vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away.
[02:28:22.448 --> 02:28:25.290]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:28:25.290 --> 02:28:26.591]  Volume 1.
[02:28:26.591 --> 02:28:28.292]  The Presidency of Barack Obama.
[02:28:29.492 --> 02:28:36.379]  Available on DVD at InfoWars.com and online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:28:36.379 --> 02:28:40.423]  The destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[02:28:40.423 --> 02:28:40.903]  October 21st, 2009.
[02:28:50.905 --> 02:28:54.728]  Now, that is yesterday's big trailer going viral everywhere right now.
[02:28:54.728 --> 02:28:58.470]  You can find them all at one place, falltherepublic.com.
[02:28:58.470 --> 02:29:09.218]  The new worldwide premiere of the Mind Control, TV Mind Control trailer, which is just one 25-minute area in the film.
[02:29:09.218 --> 02:29:20.326]  I mean, the documentary shows who the bankers are, what their master plan is, how they did the derivatives, what their next plan is with the carbon tax takeover, and the whole fraud of man-made global warming.
[02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:24.271]  And the whole eugenics angle.
[02:29:24.271 --> 02:29:28.552]  Then it goes into the mind control, how they're controlling us, the whole police state grid, and how to beat them.
[02:29:28.552 --> 02:29:29.372]  That's volume one.
[02:29:29.372 --> 02:29:35.294]  Volume two is, like, all eugenics, and how to beat them, and the choices we've got to make.
[02:29:35.294 --> 02:29:39.295]  I mean, we really look at who these creatures are in the next volume.
[02:29:39.295 --> 02:29:42.016]  But this is a quantum leap in my filmmaking.
[02:29:42.016 --> 02:29:44.236]  Hope everybody gets it and gets it out to everybody.
[02:29:44.236 --> 02:29:45.697]  It needs to be seen.
[02:29:45.697 --> 02:29:46.577]  The ball's in your court.
[02:29:51.658 --> 02:29:55.583]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.583 --> 02:29:58.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.828 --> 02:30:05.073]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.073 --> 02:30:07.075]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.075 --> 02:30:15.604]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.604 --> 02:30:21.170]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.170 --> 02:30:22.792]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.012 --> 02:30:29.518]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.518 --> 02:30:40.569]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.569 --> 02:30:41.349]  That's right.
[02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:43.912]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:43.912 --> 02:30:45.513]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:48.076 --> 02:31:06.149]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.149 --> 02:31:10.672]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.672 --> 02:31:12.954]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.954 --> 02:31:14.575]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.575 --> 02:31:15.616]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.836 --> 02:31:24.261]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:33:06.035 --> 02:33:12.418]  You know, I sent Rob Duke and Aaron Dykes up to Canada and they were really impressed with Alan Watt.
[02:33:12.418 --> 02:33:13.519]  He's really a classy guy.
[02:33:15.109 --> 02:33:21.671]  And I've interviewed him many times over the years on the radio, but getting to see him on High Def TV, editing him for the film, he's a neat guy.
[02:33:21.671 --> 02:33:24.793]  And he's going to be in Fall of the Republic 1 and 2.
[02:33:24.793 --> 02:33:31.615]  In fact, even more in 2, though he's one of the central figures in Fall of the Republic 1.
[02:33:31.615 --> 02:33:41.319]  Along with Webster Tarpley and Jesse Ventura and John Perkins and Max Kaiser and G. Edward Griffin and
[02:33:43.254 --> 02:33:49.455]  Just so many other people, Gerald Salente, the list goes on and on.
[02:33:49.455 --> 02:33:52.156]  The film is absolutely jam-packed.
[02:33:52.156 --> 02:33:54.836]  Of course, I'm in it.
[02:33:54.836 --> 02:33:57.116]  Here's the world premiere of our fourth trailer.
[02:33:57.116 --> 02:34:01.237]  We had the first trailer, kind of sneak peek, two months ago.
[02:34:01.237 --> 02:34:11.039]  Then we had another trailer that we released that just gave you kind of a general idea, and then now this latest trailer.
[02:34:11.039 --> 02:34:12.239]  So actually, this is the third trailer.
[02:34:13.024 --> 02:34:14.386]  The fourth trailer is coming out next week.
[02:34:14.386 --> 02:34:16.910]  I'm going to have a total of five.
[02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:19.453]  But here is the newest trailer.
[02:34:19.453 --> 02:34:21.316]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:21.316 --> 02:34:25.702]  We just uploaded it for PrisonPlanet.tv members in the highest quality.
[02:34:25.702 --> 02:34:29.248]  It's also been posted for everybody to see at Fall of the Republic.
[02:34:31.583 --> 02:34:36.549]  All the trailers are there in one spot, and as new ones come out and sneak peeks come out, you'll be able to see it.
[02:34:36.549 --> 02:34:44.119]  But here is the world premiere of the TV Mind Control trailer of Fall of the Republic.
[02:34:44.119 --> 02:34:47.943]  This is a sneak peek into a 20-minute section of the two-hour, 20-minute film.
[02:34:47.943 --> 02:34:48.264]  Here it is.
[02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:59.571]  Most people still today think that all entertainment to do with movies, drama, is therefore nothing more than their entertainment.
[02:34:59.571 --> 02:35:01.353]  It never ever was that case.
[02:35:01.353 --> 02:35:07.061]  Throughout history, social engineers have refined techniques designed to control large populations.
[02:35:07.061 --> 02:35:09.303]  It is bringing entertainment to thousands of people.
[02:35:10.164 --> 02:35:12.226]  Right in the comfort of our own home.
[02:35:12.226 --> 02:35:16.829]  You're actually in an alpha state being completely downloaded with new ideas.
[02:35:16.829 --> 02:35:21.252]  A cult of personality can be manufactured to influence the masses.
[02:35:21.252 --> 02:35:23.033]  Nobody will question what he's doing.
[02:35:23.033 --> 02:35:27.737]  They'll be so preoccupied with where he is or what he's wearing.
[02:35:27.737 --> 02:35:28.958]  Yes, we can!
[02:35:28.958 --> 02:35:31.259]  The idea of making him into a celebrity.
[02:35:31.259 --> 02:35:33.041]  Eventually, he said, they will expect.
[02:35:35.082 --> 02:35:44.209]  The scientific dictatorship understands what makes human beings tick, and they're using it against us.
[02:35:45.245 --> 02:35:50.208]  These cells are scanned by a stream of electrons, completing 30 pictures a second.
[02:35:50.208 --> 02:35:56.471]  It's hard for people like that to take a serious interest in what their elected officials are doing.
[02:35:56.471 --> 02:35:57.611]  They've been programmed.
[02:35:57.611 --> 02:36:01.353]  It's Obama's role to front for the International Banking Syndicate.
[02:36:01.353 --> 02:36:04.895]  Barack Obama is a puppet of the New World Order.
[02:36:04.895 --> 02:36:06.296]  Is this some sort of New World Order?
[02:36:06.296 --> 02:36:08.057]  The New World Order is emerging.
[02:36:08.057 --> 02:36:11.659]  For the first time in history, we really have this new form of an empire.
[02:36:12.227 --> 02:36:14.889]  The average man and woman is in a trance.
[02:36:14.889 --> 02:36:18.032]  They get home from work, they don't even talk to their children.
[02:36:18.032 --> 02:36:24.918]  They turn the television on, and they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives.
[02:36:24.918 --> 02:36:31.945]  You've got time to watch baseball, you've got time to entertain yourself, but a knowledgeable public we're losing.
[02:36:31.945 --> 02:36:35.308]  Kill your television, or at least turn it off a few hours a day.
[02:36:35.908 --> 02:36:38.672]  The children aren't even playing in your front yards anymore.
[02:36:38.672 --> 02:36:49.269]  We don't want to live under a world government of the corporations, by the corporations, and for the corporations.
[02:36:49.269 --> 02:36:50.571]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:36:52.694 --> 02:36:53.995]  Volume 1.
[02:36:53.995 --> 02:36:56.638]  The Presidency of Barack Obama.
[02:36:56.638 --> 02:37:01.804]  Obama is the latest version of 21st century mass mind control.
[02:37:01.804 --> 02:37:08.411]  Available on DVD at Infowars.com and online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:08.411 --> 02:37:08.912]  October 21st, 2009.
[02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:19.272]  So, there is the third trailer, fourth coming out next week, and the fifth the day before it comes out.
[02:37:19.272 --> 02:37:24.355]  We've got some special sneak peeks, too, for folks just at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:24.355 --> 02:37:26.516]  For the balance of the radio show, we'll have a quick economic
[02:37:27.452 --> 02:37:28.533]  Is Alan Watt joining us from Canada?
[02:37:58.132 --> 02:38:14.660]  I want to go over all of this with you today, but before we get into that, what is most important right now in the mind of Alan Watt, in your deep reflection and analysis as you cut through the Matrix, what's key that's developing right now that Alan Watt thinks we should all know about?
[02:38:14.660 --> 02:38:21.523]  I think we should know what the New World Order really is.
[02:38:21.523 --> 02:38:27.206]  It's a non-democratic system, a world ruled by experts and professionals.
[02:38:27.964 --> 02:38:34.786]  From all different sciences, including all the social sciences, they go under the term of world peace.
[02:38:34.786 --> 02:38:48.969]  And that sounds nice and fuzzy to most people, but when you break down in their own writings, from their own writings, what they mean by world peace, it literally is a form of totalitarianism from birth to grave.
[02:38:49.791 --> 02:38:58.336]  Uh, to do with, uh, in fact, they wanted to separate the children completely from parents so they wouldn't be contaminated with old-fashioned values and ideas.
[02:38:58.336 --> 02:39:01.658]  Uh, but they're found with scientific indoctrination.
[02:39:01.658 --> 02:39:07.101]  At kindergarten onwards, any parental input is made null and void.
[02:39:07.101 --> 02:39:08.781]  Uh, so they've pretty well reached that stage.
[02:39:08.781 --> 02:39:15.125]  They can literally program, uh, the generations every, with every intake, every year of kindergarten.
[02:39:15.711 --> 02:39:16.532]  We're good to go.
[02:39:42.233 --> 02:39:45.795]  They believe in Darwinian evolution, survival of the fittest.
[02:39:45.795 --> 02:39:47.256]  They believe that we are the old man.
[02:39:47.256 --> 02:39:50.339]  All the old types used to work in factories.
[02:39:50.339 --> 02:39:56.623]  The blue collar workers are now obsolete with the emergence of science and robots and genetic technology.
[02:39:56.623 --> 02:40:01.566]  They can create new types of better servants and not as many as they have now.
[02:40:01.566 --> 02:40:03.768]  All of this is coming down the pipe as we see.
[02:40:04.378 --> 02:40:15.427]  Even the move, as you say, to stop neighbors from looking after your child for a couple hours when they run off for some groceries is forbidden across the board in all the countries at the same time, as you say.
[02:40:15.427 --> 02:40:24.275]  And that is also to stop contamination and bonding to other people in your little locality with old-fashioned ideas.
[02:40:24.275 --> 02:40:30.640]  It's okay to put them into a recommended state-approved daycare place for a day because they get the correct kind of
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:41.208]  And simultaneously Europe and the US and England and Canada announced they want year-round school and the internal documents 20 years ago said to break up the families entirely.
[02:40:41.208 --> 02:40:58.500]  They've got the men and women working overtime so they can't spend time with their kids and then if you want to use the neighbor, in fact it even said in England BBC two groups of police officers aren't allowed to watch their own kids and the thing was wow even the godlike police aren't allowed to watch their their kids.
[02:41:00.148 --> 02:41:02.729]  Yes, and that's a pilot project for the rest of the country.
[02:41:12.285 --> 02:41:17.910]  And whatever happens in Britain eventually, very rapidly actually, is introduced across the British Commonwealth.
[02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:19.011]  And we're still a Commonwealth.
[02:41:19.011 --> 02:41:22.134]  We're still basically a subsidiary of Britain.
[02:41:22.134 --> 02:41:24.796]  And then the US picks up very quickly too.
[02:41:24.796 --> 02:41:28.719]  Everything's working together because we're already under a global system.
[02:41:28.719 --> 02:41:30.921]  We have been for a long time.
[02:41:30.921 --> 02:41:33.704]  And before even the war started on Iraq,
[02:41:35.969 --> 02:41:41.972]  The first one, the Gulf War One, were being fed on the news that we're all global, global, global.
[02:41:41.972 --> 02:41:45.734]  We went back to being national again, but they wanted recruits for the military.
[02:41:45.734 --> 02:41:57.300]  They've kept that up for face value, but in reality, they've really rolled ahead with the globalism, and every law really that comes down to every nation comes from one of the departments of the United Nations.
[02:41:57.300 --> 02:42:00.202]  It's signed into treaty automatically in all the countries.
[02:42:00.202 --> 02:42:03.744]  And we're going to speak more about them, but since you mentioned the military, notice how
[02:42:05.479 --> 02:42:23.664]  In March of last year, in the US, in England, and in Canada, but also in Ireland and Scotland, simultaneously, because I'm, just like you do, scanning all the Western media, also Asian media that's in English, simultaneously on the same day,
[02:42:24.758 --> 02:42:36.705]  They deployed troops in downtown cities and said, oh, they're just helping with drunk drivers, helping with checkpoints, and now it's, and then they go, oh, yes, it's for terrorists and for gun owners.
[02:42:36.705 --> 02:42:42.188]  So right as they implode the economy, they deploy the troops worldwide and then admit it's global.
[02:42:42.188 --> 02:42:51.494]  I mean, it's all a private corporate borg deploying this, now coming after our farms and ranches, our children, any form of independence.
[02:42:52.233 --> 02:43:02.839]  Yes, they laid out a plan a long time ago when they set up the League of Nations, the forerunner of the United Nations, and in their own charter they said eventually they'd ban all private property.
[02:43:02.839 --> 02:43:07.922]  They'd also have to eradicate farming because farming was too important to be left to farmers
[02:43:08.482 --> 02:43:12.883]  Big corporations would run the farming of the world.
[02:43:12.883 --> 02:43:15.304]  We're simply going through a pre-planned agenda.
[02:43:15.304 --> 02:43:24.107]  But now, with the century of change, and that's the key to it, this is the century of change that all academia was talking about for 50 odd years.
[02:43:24.107 --> 02:43:26.608]  We're into the century of change.
[02:43:26.608 --> 02:43:27.888]  It's not democratic.
[02:43:27.888 --> 02:43:32.850]  We see now the rise of this entity, this legal entity of the EU.
[02:43:33.050 --> 02:43:33.991]  We're good to go.
[02:44:01.887 --> 02:44:15.367]  And when you read the writings of the big players in the last 50 to 100 years involved in these international movements, like the Huxleys, like both the Huxleys, in fact Julian and Aldo Huxley and Russell and others,
[02:44:15.979 --> 02:44:24.866]  They say straight out that this world will be run by a form of scientific dictatorship, where the public will simply obey.
[02:44:24.866 --> 02:44:27.088]  That's the whole key to everything now, is obey.
[02:44:27.088 --> 02:44:28.309]  You're an animal.
[02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:35.715]  We can retrain you like any animal, the Pavlovian concept, and your job is to serve the world state.
[02:44:35.715 --> 02:44:40.499]  Now, Alan, I want to bring up a key point here, and I want you to speak to this, studying their operations.
[02:44:42.409 --> 02:44:45.331]  At the heart of it, they are social Darwinists.
[02:44:45.331 --> 02:44:57.882]  They're saying if we kill a billion people, since we are in the positions of power, that means genetically we got the power because we were the best, and so we're helping the earth by killing you.
[02:44:57.882 --> 02:45:03.146]  They're testing soft kill weapons, sterilization, as the White House science czar spoke about.
[02:45:03.146 --> 02:45:05.087]  I want to go over this with you today.
[02:45:05.948 --> 02:45:26.646]  But, more than that, they get the general public to adopt the eugenics ideas, but they don't even consciously know why of, yeah, humans are a parasite, yeah, there's too many of us, we don't have art and literature and spacecraft and, you know, we can't do incredible things, which we actually are an incredible species, a wonderful species, a self-aware species.
[02:45:30.063 --> 02:45:49.768]  The elites believe they're gods, they believe they're wonderful, and they want to control the future, and so they only sell the public on lowering their survival instinct so they will accept and make it a religious sacrament, dying for their carbon footprint, or not having children, or being sacrificed to the earth.
[02:45:51.408 --> 02:46:04.370]  So this idea that man is crud, man is crap, they sell this and sell this and say you have no rights, you're just an animal, it's a mind game, it's a huckster scam to say you can make no decisions, you're just programmed.
[02:46:05.185 --> 02:46:18.372]  But then, oh, the elites have to have their rights, they have to have their bodyguards, oh, they're free, they write all this sick, dark, nihilistic poetry about how they control everything and they'll destroy everything if they want to.
[02:46:18.372 --> 02:46:23.114]  So, inherently, these are very sick, evil control freaks.
[02:46:23.114 --> 02:46:25.315]  There's no doubt about it at all.
[02:46:25.315 --> 02:46:27.156]  It's a religion with them.
[02:46:27.156 --> 02:46:33.540]  It's a complete, it fulfills all the criteria of a religious belief system and superior genetic
[02:46:35.206 --> 02:46:37.127]  Basically, a hereditary genetic stock.
[02:46:37.127 --> 02:46:38.087]  That's what they believe in.
[02:46:38.087 --> 02:46:39.648]  They're from it.
[02:46:39.648 --> 02:46:42.570]  They believe that we are the leftover junk genes at the bottom.
[02:46:42.570 --> 02:46:44.312]  Otherwise, we would be up at the top.
[02:46:44.312 --> 02:46:46.853]  That's the simple reasoning that they have.
[02:46:46.853 --> 02:46:48.374]  And they believe in power.
[02:46:48.374 --> 02:46:51.797]  Total power is the main key to survival.
[02:46:51.797 --> 02:46:55.179]  Therefore, they're the ones at the top with the total power.
[02:46:55.179 --> 02:46:57.040]  And they do plan to exercise it.
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:58.401]  They are exercising it now.
[02:46:59.088 --> 02:47:22.034]  I just went through stuff that was released from the World Health Organization from some of its meetings that have never disclosed to the public before, and they admit during their own discussions, their internal debates, that most of these vaccines, all of the vaccines in fact, the vast bulk of the contaminants in them, including genetic contaminants and viruses, are unknown to them.
[02:47:22.034 --> 02:47:26.515]  Sometimes 90% of every inoculation and polio still
[02:47:27.245 --> 02:47:27.665]  I don't know.
[02:47:44.537 --> 02:47:44.917]  No!
[02:47:44.917 --> 02:47:45.037]  No!
[02:48:10.140 --> 02:48:11.321]  Now, Alan, stop.
[02:48:11.321 --> 02:48:14.363]  This is mind-blowing, and we're on the same page.
[02:48:14.363 --> 02:48:19.327]  This is admitted in hundreds of government textbooks, like Ecoscience by the White House Science Czar.
[02:48:19.327 --> 02:48:32.056]  We now have bought over 10 books he authored, all saying the same sickening stuff about how they would do this, inject us with cancer viruses that would trigger, as soon as our hormone levels lowered in men and women between 45 and 65.
[02:48:32.056 --> 02:48:33.337]  We now see that happening.
[02:48:33.797 --> 02:48:42.548]  The boldness, what do you call the boldness of where they openly say they're killing us, where they openly admit the first 10 million people in Canada and the U.S.
[02:48:42.548 --> 02:48:47.655]  to get the nasal live flu virus, they admit it's going to mutate it and spread it.
[02:48:48.877 --> 02:48:55.345]  So in plain view, they admit it has cancer viruses in the major German and British news.
[02:48:55.345 --> 02:48:58.729]  We're shooting cancer viruses live into our nostrils.
[02:48:58.729 --> 02:49:01.692]  They admit the Gardasil's killing the girls and mutating.
[02:49:01.692 --> 02:49:03.755]  It's own inventor came out and said don't take it.
[02:49:03.755 --> 02:49:05.557]  I'm sure they'll kill her or something.
[02:49:05.557 --> 02:49:07.639]  The point is, is that
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:09.281]  What do you call that?
[02:49:09.281 --> 02:49:11.962]  Because I see them testing the ambient murder.
[02:49:11.962 --> 02:49:20.526]  They're now just killing us right out in the open and just setting the precedent to do it and then everyone's dropping dead or dying and it's like no big deal.
[02:49:20.526 --> 02:49:22.027]  That's right.
[02:49:22.027 --> 02:49:26.890]  In fact, even admits from the World Health Organization that they're doing a massive campaign
[02:49:27.390 --> 02:49:38.456]  To train the public, train the public to accept that masses of people die all the time from strokes and heart attacks and cancers, so don't relate it to the vaccine that you're getting.
[02:49:38.456 --> 02:49:41.057]  This is the present propaganda blitz that's out right now.
[02:49:41.758 --> 02:49:47.161]  So they're training the victim to accept his own death and put it down to coincidence.
[02:49:47.161 --> 02:49:53.444]  It's amazing that they understand what they can do to the public because they've lied so many times in the past.
[02:49:53.444 --> 02:49:57.006]  They know the formulas, the techniques, and they know how we respond.
[02:49:57.006 --> 02:50:07.792]  If there's one percent of credibility in their argument, the public will want to believe them rather than cross the line and say, these guys are killing us.
[02:50:07.792 --> 02:50:10.874]  Because the average person, just like in Hardin, Montana, when I caught
[02:50:12.065 --> 02:50:28.571]  When our listeners caught the con artist felon now admitted running a giant takeover of the town to put the locals in the camp the private criminal was going to own, still the local constabulary denies it even if it's admitted because they don't want to admit they're wrong and it's too scary to admit it's happening.
[02:50:29.039 --> 02:50:34.262]  And these are all eugenicists and they talk about, they go, it's sad we have to kill everyone, but it's for the earth.
[02:50:52.702 --> 02:50:54.828]  Everybody out there, you gotta warn everybody you can.
[02:50:54.828 --> 02:50:58.337]  They're implanting you and your family with cancer viruses.
[02:50:58.337 --> 02:50:59.460]  These also spread.
[02:50:59.460 --> 02:51:00.623]  It's not just a shot.
[02:51:01.530 --> 02:51:06.034]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[02:51:06.034 --> 02:51:10.298]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[02:51:10.298 --> 02:51:21.148]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is handpicked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[02:51:21.148 --> 02:51:23.370]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful
[02:51:26.275 --> 02:51:27.115]  We're good to go.
[02:51:52.824 --> 02:51:53.324]  We're good to go.
[02:52:16.374 --> 02:52:16.714]  We're good.
[02:52:35.168 --> 02:52:38.210]  Directly to your computer or iPhone and share it with others.
[02:52:38.210 --> 02:52:44.213]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[02:52:44.213 --> 02:52:49.095]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:52:49.095 --> 02:52:51.937]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[02:53:02.449 --> 02:53:09.972]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:53:09.972 --> 02:53:14.474]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:53:14.474 --> 02:53:19.616]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:53:19.616 --> 02:53:25.759]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain
[02:53:25.759 --> 02:53:26.019]  I think so.

[02:53:53.722 --> 02:53:55.083]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:54:23.078 --> 02:54:34.185]  Alright, I want to open the phones up next hour for Alan Watts, specifically on eugenics, the master plan, how to stop them, what they're doing.
[02:54:34.185 --> 02:54:34.505]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:34.505 --> 02:54:34.865]  800-259-9231.
[02:54:34.865 --> 02:54:38.107]  He can talk about any issue, but please address your questions to Alan Watts.
[02:54:38.107 --> 02:54:41.749]  I don't want to talk about a tractor you got for sale, or two Bacabras in your attic.
[02:54:41.749 --> 02:54:44.611]  And I'm not being mean, I just... Sometimes people do that.
[02:54:44.611 --> 02:54:47.853]  Especially if we have a guest, it's like they will not address anything to them.
[02:54:47.853 --> 02:54:47.933]  It's...
[02:54:49.474 --> 02:54:55.360]  Kind of like Piggly Wiggly gets to the head of the line and then nobody else gets to get on.
[02:54:55.360 --> 02:54:56.181]  So, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:56.181 --> 02:54:57.782]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[02:54:57.782 --> 02:55:02.226]  Alan, we were just talking during the break about social control.
[02:55:02.226 --> 02:55:07.992]  It's just like the Aztecs, one of the dominant Mesoamerican Mayan cultures.
[02:55:07.992 --> 02:55:10.835]  And in their own writings, and in what the Spanish observed,
[02:55:12.208 --> 02:55:23.455]  Mothers would beg to have their healthiest, best, because you wanted to have the best sacrifice, 10-year-old only son cut up in pieces and then sold as meat by the priest class.
[02:55:23.455 --> 02:55:25.496]  That's how they made their money, to the locals.
[02:55:25.496 --> 02:55:28.178]  And the mothers would gobble their children with pleasure.
[02:55:28.178 --> 02:55:29.999]  We have major
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:33.601]  News out of Seoul, Korea and China.
[02:55:33.601 --> 02:55:34.681]  This is mainstream.
[02:55:34.681 --> 02:55:35.942]  Baby soup.
[02:55:35.942 --> 02:55:37.382]  Not a hoax.
[02:55:37.382 --> 02:55:38.723]  Eating babies.
[02:55:38.723 --> 02:55:43.285]  People get upset if they see a dog killed by Marines, but not if they see a kid killed by Marines.
[02:55:43.285 --> 02:55:45.946]  We've been trained to see human life as bad.
[02:55:45.946 --> 02:55:55.329]  And through mind control, just through cultural mind control, Aztecs would kill their sons and daughters and wives and husbands with pleasure.
[02:55:55.329 --> 02:55:57.130]  The Druids would do this.
[02:55:57.930 --> 02:55:59.110]  And it's the same thing now.
[02:55:59.110 --> 02:56:01.431]  We just give our kids to the state.
[02:56:01.431 --> 02:56:09.973]  Because as our guest said earlier, in England, a mother said, yeah, it was really hard to lose the weight, ruined my figure.
[02:56:09.973 --> 02:56:15.554]  They said that was a symbol of depression, so they took the baby from the family with no due process.
[02:56:15.554 --> 02:56:17.475]  The criminal state is here.
[02:56:17.475 --> 02:56:18.695]  Go ahead.
[02:56:18.695 --> 02:56:21.916]  Yes, again, too interesting to look at the old video.
[02:56:22.614 --> 02:56:24.735]  I think it's still up maybe on YouTube, I don't know.
[02:56:24.735 --> 02:56:27.316]  I can't watch it because of my slow speed.
[02:56:27.316 --> 02:56:29.758]  They punish me for using ExplorerNet.
[02:56:29.758 --> 02:56:36.961]  But there was a Julian Huxley up there, an Aldo Huxley, and these guys went into this whole thing.
[02:56:36.961 --> 02:56:42.144]  And Aldo Huxley himself, who attended all the world meetings, he also worked at Tavistock Institute.
[02:56:43.055 --> 02:56:51.201]  He thought that the scientific dictatorship would be just sort of wonderful when it came in, and the people would be trained to love their servitude.
[02:56:51.201 --> 02:57:02.730]  But he also talked about the only obstacle they had at that time, back in the 50s, was the remnants of a powerful, or almost post-powerful, Christianity.
[02:57:04.115 --> 02:57:09.119]  That ties in with what his brother Julian said, the first CEO of UNESCO.
[02:57:09.119 --> 02:57:20.946]  He said, we'll have to train the people to devaluate human life in order to bring through mass abortions and eventually genetic selection and sterilization.
[02:57:20.946 --> 02:57:23.568]  So this is the plan unfolding now.
[02:57:23.568 --> 02:57:26.770]  These guys were part of the big world meetings of their day.
[02:57:26.770 --> 02:57:32.834]  They set their agendas, they set their timetables, they set it for the end of the millennium into the new that's now.
[02:57:33.689 --> 02:57:36.070]  And that's why they call this the Century of Change.
[02:57:36.070 --> 02:57:38.511]  And they never alter their plans.
[02:57:38.511 --> 02:57:46.215]  Their plans are like long-term business plans set in stone, with 10-year plans for one part, 50 for another, 100 for another.
[02:57:46.215 --> 02:57:57.481]  We see this same type of plan cropping up in the declassified information put out by the top think tanks for the military going up to the year 2050 and beyond.
[02:57:57.481 --> 02:58:01.163]  And the kind of world that will be then, and society will have then,
[02:58:01.929 --> 02:58:15.998]  And we have, of course, the Rockefellers trotting around the world, still pushing the depopulation plan, eugenics plan, that the fittest should survive, the rest should get sterilized, and the unwanted should simply be killed off by various means.
[02:58:15.998 --> 02:58:25.643]  This is happening as we live, and the public don't even know it's happening because they're trained to ignore and not participate in their own destiny.
[02:58:25.643 --> 02:58:29.606]  Got a break, coming back 50 minutes left in the next hour with Alan Watt.
[02:58:30.540 --> 02:58:32.441]  This is what's happening.
[02:58:32.441 --> 02:58:37.062]  And they're training us to turn our own predator instinct on our own species.
[02:58:37.062 --> 02:58:42.784]  That's what the police, the military, all of it is.
[02:58:42.784 --> 02:58:44.205]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.205 --> 02:58:46.745]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.902 --> 02:58:54.284]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.284 --> 02:58:57.906]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.906 --> 02:59:02.488]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.488 --> 02:59:08.071]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.371 --> 02:59:13.134]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.134 --> 02:59:16.757]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.757 --> 02:59:21.580]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.580 --> 02:59:28.144]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.144 --> 02:59:30.066]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.566 --> 02:59:33.767]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.767 --> 02:59:38.268]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.268 --> 02:59:40.069]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:59:40.069 --> 02:59:40.509]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.509 --> 02:59:40.809]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.809 --> 02:59:41.049]  Don't wait.
[02:59:41.049 --> 02:59:41.669]  Call today.
[02:59:41.669 --> 02:59:42.710]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:43.990]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:14.226 --> 03:00:17.448]  Alan Watt, one of the main contributors.
[03:00:17.448 --> 03:00:20.391]  One of the stars in Fall Republic.
[03:00:20.391 --> 03:00:21.712]  It's going to be Fall Republic 2.
[03:00:21.712 --> 03:00:23.794]  It comes out March 15th of next year.
[03:00:23.794 --> 03:00:24.854]  The big eugenics film.
[03:00:25.856 --> 03:00:29.659]  Well, going into the writings again of some of the biggest players who did publish lots of their work,
[03:00:52.901 --> 03:01:04.705]  Well, we find their techniques, because they explain their techniques, and they were so assured of them working, that could only have been done because of previous experimentation on populations.
[03:01:04.705 --> 03:01:08.006]  And we're going back to the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s.
[03:01:08.006 --> 03:01:15.429]  The Huxleys, for instance, talked about people loving their servitude, and they often used the term domestication.
[03:01:16.683 --> 03:01:17.844]  Domesticate the public.
[03:01:17.844 --> 03:01:26.689]  What they meant was, and they even said this, that the only true survivors that are fit to survive are wild animals that retain all of the survival capabilities.
[03:01:26.689 --> 03:01:33.172]  In order to rule all the lesser types, the inferior humans, who haven't made it to the top, they'd have to domesticate them.
[03:01:33.172 --> 03:01:37.314]  That meant to eradicate their instincts for self-preservation.
[03:01:37.314 --> 03:01:42.397]  Train them that experts were looking after everything that they should look after by themselves.
[03:01:43.428 --> 03:01:47.229]  And even to the extent where they couldn't do anything without expert advice.
[03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:51.250]  Well, we've had a massive campaign since about the fifties onwards.
[03:01:51.250 --> 03:01:56.772]  Listen to the experts all through magazines, TVs, even in news breaks or even weather breaks.
[03:01:56.772 --> 03:02:01.193]  You get experts coming on telling you how to dress for the rain.
[03:02:01.193 --> 03:02:03.793]  This is a form of domestication.
[03:02:03.793 --> 03:02:06.394]  It's meant to make you think that you know nothing.
[03:02:06.394 --> 03:02:08.615]  You're too stupid to understand.
[03:02:08.615 --> 03:02:09.555]  And just accept it.
[03:02:10.126 --> 03:02:16.630]  Except there are better types of people above you taking care of all the big problems that you should be taking care of.
[03:02:16.630 --> 03:02:26.715]  And your job is to simply play as much as you can play and enjoy yourself and don't become involved in the big problems in life to do with politics, policies or anything else.
[03:02:26.715 --> 03:02:27.435]  Just accept it.
[03:02:27.435 --> 03:02:29.376]  That's called domestication.
[03:02:29.376 --> 03:02:34.739]  Until you literally have no self-preservation instincts left.
[03:02:34.739 --> 03:02:37.641]  When that happens, you're now ready for extermination.
[03:02:38.271 --> 03:02:45.557]  And then they can even train you, as you say, they're training the children to volunteer for sterilization to save the world.
[03:02:45.557 --> 03:02:50.580]  And, of course, this new religion of ecology is a religion.
[03:02:50.580 --> 03:02:55.224]  As Gorbachev said, we are creating a new religion based on a form of earth worship.
[03:02:55.224 --> 03:03:01.569]  But, of course, it's got its own high priests that decide who should procreate and who should not procreate.
[03:03:01.569 --> 03:03:03.971]  And that's not fast enough for them.
[03:03:03.971 --> 03:03:06.252]  They want to start killing us off even faster.
[03:03:06.252 --> 03:03:06.873]  We're not
[03:03:07.253 --> 03:03:13.718]  Breeding enough in the West to tell us that we're almost sterile, and hence the emigration levels are massive.
[03:03:13.718 --> 03:03:19.203]  However, we're not dying fast enough across the world, so they want to speed up the process.
[03:03:19.203 --> 03:03:23.146]  And so you must, you mustn't tell them any truth.
[03:03:23.146 --> 03:03:29.431]  You must say it's all so strange that these cancers are affecting everyone and everyone's dying.
[03:03:29.431 --> 03:03:30.271]  And that'll be taught.
[03:03:30.271 --> 03:03:32.133]  It's just a new, a new happening.
[03:03:32.213 --> 03:03:32.954]  Well they're saying that.
[03:03:32.954 --> 03:03:56.736]  They're saying you're all just going to die of cancer and you're all just going to die of diabetes and doesn't matter what you do, just take your shot and you're going to die and there's going to be lots of deaths and yeah it's a live virus and yeah you're going to die but it wasn't the vaccine but it does say on the insert it may kill you and this Gardasil is going to kill you but it doesn't protect you from the cancer but it will give you cancer but everything's fine and they just throw it all out there
[03:03:58.127 --> 03:04:01.088]  And it's like the public really is in a trance.
[03:04:01.088 --> 03:04:03.869]  Now more and more of them are starting to wake up.
[03:04:03.869 --> 03:04:10.272]  So the establishment's program is to shock us even more and pile on, hoping people just give up.
[03:04:11.468 --> 03:04:13.088]  Yeah, it's a technique.
[03:04:13.088 --> 03:04:20.770]  They give you the dialectical process, the pros and the cons, they get you into a punch-drunk state, and you simply give up.
[03:04:20.770 --> 03:04:28.432]  And then you say, well, they can't be doing this for negative reasons to kill us, so I'll just go along with the rest of the public.
[03:04:28.432 --> 03:04:30.272]  That's how simple it is.
[03:04:30.272 --> 03:04:37.454]  People look around for a hero to follow, and if there's no heroes, they simply go along with the rest of the public and do what they do.
[03:04:37.454 --> 03:04:39.254]  That's what Huxley said himself.
[03:04:40.444 --> 03:04:46.688]  Now let's talk about in the short term what their program is, long term, but also solutions.
[03:04:46.688 --> 03:04:51.292]  How you think this battle is going to shake out and what things will look like if they win.
[03:04:51.292 --> 03:04:53.713]  Any other important angles Alan Watt wants to cover.
[03:04:53.713 --> 03:04:54.594]  And then your phone calls.
[03:04:54.594 --> 03:04:57.196]  That'll take us in lots of interesting, random directions.
[03:04:57.196 --> 03:04:57.996]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:57.996 --> 03:04:58.437]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.701 --> 03:05:04.704]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.704 --> 03:05:10.049]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.049 --> 03:05:12.091]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.091 --> 03:05:17.096]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.096 --> 03:05:18.017]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.257 --> 03:05:19.378]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.378 --> 03:05:21.279]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.279 --> 03:05:22.340]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.340 --> 03:05:24.541]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.541 --> 03:05:25.882]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.882 --> 03:05:27.423]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.423 --> 03:05:32.686]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.686 --> 03:05:36.269]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.269 --> 03:05:39.731]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.091 --> 03:05:41.312]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.312 --> 03:05:42.213]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.213 --> 03:05:43.314]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.314 --> 03:05:44.254]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.254 --> 03:05:45.335]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.335 --> 03:05:48.398]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.398 --> 03:05:50.159]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.159 --> 03:05:51.080]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.683 --> 03:06:06.010]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.010 --> 03:06:10.516]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.516 --> 03:06:12.799]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.799 --> 03:06:14.441]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.441 --> 03:06:15.463]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.683 --> 03:06:24.108]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:06:24.108 --> 03:06:31.572]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:06:31.572 --> 03:06:37.616]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[03:06:37.616 --> 03:06:43.199]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:06:43.619 --> 03:06:47.761]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[03:06:47.761 --> 03:06:54.004]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[03:06:54.004 --> 03:06:55.225]  866-762-9238.
[03:06:55.225 --> 03:07:07.311]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[03:07:07.311 --> 03:07:08.892]  Aerial Spring.
[03:07:08.892 --> 03:07:10.112]  Chemtrails.
[03:07:10.112 --> 03:07:11.493]  The Modified Atmosphere.
[03:07:12.270 --> 03:07:19.055]  Heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[03:07:19.055 --> 03:07:22.137]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[03:07:22.137 --> 03:07:31.845]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[03:07:31.845 --> 03:07:36.568]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[03:07:36.568 --> 03:07:40.451]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[03:07:40.451 --> 03:07:41.712]  Cleaning out heavy metals
[03:07:42.236 --> 03:07:42.896]  Big Brother!
[03:08:07.424 --> 03:08:09.185]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.185 --> 03:08:10.946]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:10.946 --> 03:08:12.546]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.546 --> 03:08:14.087]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.087 --> 03:08:18.289]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.289 --> 03:08:22.331]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:25.154 --> 03:08:30.975]  We're going back to our live, extremely intriguing and informative and enlightening interview with Alan Wadham.
[03:08:30.975 --> 03:08:33.316]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com here in a moment.
[03:08:33.316 --> 03:08:35.376]  And we're going to open the phones up.
[03:08:35.376 --> 03:08:41.118]  Before we do that, though, I want to thank a few of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[03:08:41.118 --> 03:08:43.998]  One of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[03:08:43.998 --> 03:08:46.379]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes.
[03:08:47.623 --> 03:08:48.844]  Snow and ice storms.
[03:08:48.844 --> 03:08:52.087]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid and here's a good way to do just that.
[03:08:52.087 --> 03:08:56.650]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsors, the Losers from Science.
[03:08:56.650 --> 03:08:58.752]  You can use it to run an Ecola Blue, whatever.
[03:08:58.752 --> 03:09:07.398]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source, 800 watt generator, and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:09:07.398 --> 03:09:10.661]  Remember too that generators, like gas generators, need gas.
[03:09:10.661 --> 03:09:14.404]  But in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[03:09:14.764 --> 03:09:16.865]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[03:09:16.865 --> 03:09:20.427]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[03:09:20.427 --> 03:09:21.787]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:09:21.787 --> 03:09:25.209]  That's MySolarBackup.com, or give the great folks a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:09:25.209 --> 03:09:25.289]  877-327-0365.
[03:09:25.289 --> 03:09:27.730]  Got a new sponsor here I'm really excited about.
[03:09:27.730 --> 03:09:28.651]  It's EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:09:28.651 --> 03:09:29.391]  EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:09:29.391 --> 03:09:31.672]  You've heard of all the folks.
[03:09:44.541 --> 03:09:52.864]  Moving down there, like the health ranger and people, and this will let you know if you're going to move down there, or get a second home down there, or bug out for a while down there.
[03:09:52.864 --> 03:09:54.264]  You want to be in the mountains.
[03:09:54.264 --> 03:09:56.305]  Explains that kind of stuff.
[03:09:56.305 --> 03:10:05.188]  It is your duty to know every option you have to protect you and your family, whether you are looking for a rental property or a new start, or if you just want to know your options.
[03:10:05.188 --> 03:10:08.289]  I urge you to go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:10:08.289 --> 03:10:08.909]  E-C-U-A-D-O-U-R.
[03:10:11.940 --> 03:10:13.761]  Just added a word to that, a letter to that.
[03:10:13.761 --> 03:10:17.383]  E-C-U-A-D-O-R Central.
[03:10:17.383 --> 03:10:19.084]  Ecuadorcentral.com.
[03:10:19.084 --> 03:10:20.305]  The website is great.
[03:10:20.305 --> 03:10:24.147]  It will give you all the information you would want to know before you go.
[03:10:24.147 --> 03:10:27.729]  Go to Ecuadorcentral.com and see what these folks are doing.
[03:10:27.729 --> 03:10:34.053]  Whether you're interested in real estate investment, travel, or just want to see pictures and videos, go to Ecuadorcentral.com.
[03:10:34.053 --> 03:10:34.913]  That's Ecuadorcentral.com.
[03:10:36.554 --> 03:10:46.000]  And lastly here, I want to thank the great sponsors at efoodsdirect.com, the premier storable foods company, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:56.806]  They have an entire organic line, and it's all about being larger meals than what other places have, fresher meals, no GMO, no MSG.
[03:10:56.806 --> 03:10:59.107]  It's just great, and it was all recently produced.
[03:10:59.107 --> 03:11:01.349]  I mean, like last month or quicker.
[03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:03.290]  I mean, this isn't some 10-year-old junk you're buying.
[03:11:05.143 --> 03:11:06.825]  Once you get it, it lasts more than 10 years.
[03:11:06.825 --> 03:11:08.307]  So, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:11:08.307 --> 03:11:09.708]  One word, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:11:09.708 --> 03:11:11.490]  I'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:11:11.490 --> 03:11:13.512]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 1-800-409-5633.
[03:11:13.512 --> 03:11:19.679]  1-800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com.
[03:11:19.679 --> 03:11:22.883]  And it is these sponsors that make the whole show possible.
[03:11:22.883 --> 03:11:23.864]  How are we able to do this?
[03:11:23.864 --> 03:11:25.145]  How are we able to have this facility?
[03:11:26.397 --> 03:11:31.760]  Be on shortwave and AM and FM and reach all these people and have these webmasters and all this bandwidth.
[03:11:31.760 --> 03:11:33.881]  You the supporters and the sponsors.
[03:11:33.881 --> 03:11:35.842]  So I want to thank all of you out there.
[03:11:35.842 --> 03:11:39.604]  All right, Alan, I'm going to shut up for the rest of this segment before we go to calls.
[03:11:39.604 --> 03:11:49.308]  Getting into what their current operation is, what you think is happening with the flu, those new World Health Organization documents you have, they're up on CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[03:11:50.669 --> 03:11:55.812]  Well, I think the people first have to understand that they're not dealing with democratic institutions.
[03:11:55.812 --> 03:11:59.954]  You're dealing with people with an agenda who are all pre-chosen before they get into politics, who train
[03:12:20.896 --> 03:12:22.557]  into their roles.
[03:12:22.557 --> 03:12:25.620]  And they're all on board with this agenda.
[03:12:25.620 --> 03:12:29.663]  So technically, there's no negotiation with them, to be honest with you.
[03:12:29.663 --> 03:12:40.152]  The only thing that's left outside of outright revolution is for large groups of people to literally hit them economically.
[03:12:40.152 --> 03:12:48.839]  For instance, an example, the nurses of New York State have been told that they're going to be fired if they don't take this swine flu shot.
[03:12:50.394 --> 03:13:07.179]  My suggestion to them is for them to walk off en masse, and just walk out the hospital en masse for a day or two, and you'll see the howls and the screams that those guys want to bring you to the negotiating table, that these are the only kinds of strategies left for people outside revolution.
[03:13:07.179 --> 03:13:17.502]  And the boys at the top know this because they've been setting up internal armies and securities for 20 years for this particular time that we're going through now.
[03:13:18.075 --> 03:13:20.277]  They knew this time would come.
[03:13:20.277 --> 03:13:24.200]  So, to be honest, there's no easy way out of this.
[03:13:24.200 --> 03:13:28.404]  This is life or death situations that we're going through right now.
[03:13:28.404 --> 03:13:30.606]  They have their depopulation program.
[03:13:30.606 --> 03:13:39.754]  The World Health Organization at their meeting in 2006, their world meeting, stated that if they can get the public to accept mandatory inoculation for one thing,
[03:13:40.444 --> 03:13:49.668]  Then introduce more mandatory inoculations every year for the rest of the adult's life, including annual boosters for every shot they've ever had.
[03:13:49.668 --> 03:13:51.229]  We're going to be toxic.
[03:13:51.229 --> 03:13:59.013]  Laboratories, walking out laboratories, walking test tubes with a competent DNA all getting together and killing us all the quicker through cancers.
[03:13:59.013 --> 03:14:01.033]  They know this at the top.
[03:14:01.033 --> 03:14:06.056]  So the thing is you can't take a step forward to negotiate that what you say is no.
[03:14:07.102 --> 03:14:10.384]  That's the word we're going to relearn as Noah and say, no, I'm not taking this.
[03:14:10.384 --> 03:14:14.466]  I don't care what you want to do with me because you're going to kill me anyway.
[03:14:14.466 --> 03:14:16.527]  So I'm not taking this shot.
[03:14:16.527 --> 03:14:21.510]  And people have got to start regaining their individual rights and freedoms.
[03:14:21.510 --> 03:14:24.292]  If you don't fight for them, you don't have any.
[03:14:24.292 --> 03:14:29.134]  You can't write something on a piece of paper and go back to sleep thinking it's all done.
[03:14:29.134 --> 03:14:30.935]  And even the founding fathers of the U.S.
[03:14:30.935 --> 03:14:33.657]  said that every generation would have to fight to keep it.
[03:14:34.508 --> 03:14:35.089]  I don't know.
[03:14:51.710 --> 03:14:56.355]  And Alan continuing on the flu front, they're now ordering kids to go to school to take it.
[03:14:56.355 --> 03:14:57.756]  No law, they just do it.
[03:14:57.756 --> 03:15:02.181]  Clinics all over the country are saying take it or we'll call CPS on you.
[03:15:02.181 --> 03:15:03.822]  No law, they just do it.
[03:15:03.822 --> 03:15:06.045]  We're seeing the real tyranny and they're bragging.
[03:15:07.028 --> 03:15:23.010]  That they're setting the precedent to force over 56 vaccine boosters, so that's now in the hundreds, every couple years of meningitis shots, hepatitis shots, the AIDS vaccine, and Bill Gates has now bragged, and it's in the Associated Press,
[03:15:24.633 --> 03:15:27.035]  When he laughs, when he gives a speech.
[03:15:27.035 --> 03:15:31.238]  Oh, I found out we're giving people polio with the new vaccine.
[03:15:31.238 --> 03:15:32.359]  It happens to be live.
[03:15:32.359 --> 03:15:37.464]  And then the little elite clubs, they all giggle because the local good old boys, they're in on the fun.
[03:15:38.368 --> 03:15:39.369]  That's Nigeria.
[03:15:39.369 --> 03:15:49.038]  Nigeria has now got a new, evolved type of polio that they admit now that the World Health Organization came from the particular vaccine they were giving the people there.
[03:15:49.038 --> 03:15:53.842]  It's evolved into a new hyper polio that's rampaging through the public.
[03:15:53.842 --> 03:15:55.083]  It came from the vaccine.
[03:15:55.083 --> 03:15:55.964]  They admit it because
[03:15:56.364 --> 03:16:05.788]  And now they admit in the mainstream literature that the live nasal vaccine is going to create hundreds of mutations and is what's spreading H1N1.
[03:16:05.788 --> 03:16:16.773]  So out in the open, they hit us with all the fools that are shooting it up their kid's nose, sneezing on everybody, and the public is so dumbed down they can't even understand it.
[03:16:16.773 --> 03:16:24.796]  Again, they've been trained that experts don't lie, and we've had 50 years of training into this new type of system.
[03:16:25.596 --> 03:16:27.177]  The public can't believe.
[03:16:27.177 --> 03:16:33.980]  As I say, you can get off the ladder, but until you literally cross the last rung and stand on it, you won't see the big picture.
[03:16:33.980 --> 03:16:35.621]  And the last rung is difficult.
[03:16:35.621 --> 03:16:41.724]  It's difficult to cross and say, they're not just talking about killing us, they have been killing us and they want to kill more of us.
[03:16:41.724 --> 03:16:49.368]  When you really understand that it's true, you'll see everything completely different from then on as to what you can do.
[03:16:49.368 --> 03:16:50.929]  So you can't negotiate with tyranny.
[03:16:52.930 --> 03:16:55.354]  Well, the key here is they're not negotiating.
[03:16:55.354 --> 03:16:56.295]  They're not stopping.
[03:16:56.295 --> 03:16:58.098]  It's a power cult.
[03:16:58.098 --> 03:17:00.822]  And we have to admit they're testing the soft kill now.
[03:17:00.822 --> 03:17:03.546]  And I want to talk some about solutions here.
[03:17:03.546 --> 03:17:08.614]  But everything you bring up just just just literally flags come up because it's all so accurate.
[03:17:11.653 --> 03:17:22.463]  You know, dealing with all of this and watching them kill us, and then all these little petty power people who don't even care if they're being killed themselves, as long as they can kill people under them.
[03:17:22.463 --> 03:17:23.684]  It's very sick.
[03:17:23.684 --> 03:17:24.665]  Yes.
[03:17:24.665 --> 03:17:34.814]  And again, too, the test it all, whether it's Stanford is a big player, and it's all the universities have their specialized areas in creating vaccines or bacteria or viruses for warfare purposes.
[03:17:35.444 --> 03:17:44.792]  But they're also into the social science and psychology, and Stanford is one of the prime universities for mass control, basically.
[03:17:44.792 --> 03:17:55.701]  They did the old Milgaard experiments on testing people's obedience to authority by shocking people, at least training people, that they're actually shocking a victim on the other side of the glass.
[03:17:56.241 --> 03:17:56.381]  Yeah, 90%!
[03:17:56.381 --> 03:17:57.782]  You can take a farm boy and make him a cop.
[03:17:57.782 --> 03:18:04.467]  Six months later, 90% in the Stanford research will put a gun to their mother's head and blow her brains across the room if someone in a uniform orders them to do it.
[03:18:23.320 --> 03:18:24.901]  Yes, and it's true.
[03:18:24.901 --> 03:18:33.825]  These are all techniques that have been understood by the high sciences and occult guys and masonry and so on at the top.
[03:18:33.825 --> 03:18:36.126]  You find it in the riots of New York in the 1800s.
[03:18:39.108 --> 03:18:46.493]  The mayor, at the time of the whole riots, he said that we can always hire half the poor to kill the other half.
[03:18:46.493 --> 03:18:47.633]  That's what he said.
[03:18:47.633 --> 03:18:49.375]  They understand this.
[03:18:49.375 --> 03:18:51.116]  Money's the key.
[03:18:51.116 --> 03:18:55.058]  I can survive, I get money, I'll go on the winning side, don't leave me alone.
[03:18:55.058 --> 03:18:59.681]  That's what they think, until their usefulness is over, and then they're eliminated too.
[03:19:02.239 --> 03:19:02.960]  Unbelievable.
[03:19:02.960 --> 03:19:03.660]  Alan, let's do this.
[03:19:03.660 --> 03:19:11.166]  Let's come back and take calls, and then at the end of the last segment, let's get into a little bit of solutions, but we're going to have you back up for more of that as well.
[03:19:11.166 --> 03:19:26.999]  But I guess what you're saying is the big solution is becoming aware of this matrix of propaganda and social engineering, and really getting upset about it, and really talking human to human about the ruling elite and their program for humanity, and ask the public, do you like being controlled?
[03:19:26.999 --> 03:19:28.120]  Do you like being poisoned?
[03:19:28.720 --> 03:19:34.362]  Do you like everybody being blubbery and bleached skin and unhealthy and zits all over the place?
[03:19:34.362 --> 03:19:35.582]  I mean, do you like being poisoned?
[03:19:35.582 --> 03:19:39.963]  Do you like half the kids in your neighborhood dead or dying of diseases or cancer?
[03:19:39.963 --> 03:19:40.844]  I mean, is this what?
[03:19:40.844 --> 03:19:42.164]  Because it's only going to get worse.
[03:19:42.164 --> 03:19:43.805]  I mean, is it fun?
[03:19:43.805 --> 03:19:49.446]  I mean, to cops out there, is the petty power, the petty manhood rituals, is it fun?
[03:19:49.446 --> 03:19:50.687]  Do you like being used?
[03:19:50.687 --> 03:19:53.307]  Are you going to serve this?
[03:19:53.307 --> 03:19:54.488]  Ninety percent of you will.
[03:19:55.515 --> 03:19:58.536]  Unless you were conscious of the manipulation.
[03:19:58.536 --> 03:20:01.476]  We'll be right back with Alan White.
[03:20:01.476 --> 03:20:02.216]  Hello, friends.
[03:20:02.216 --> 03:20:05.357]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[03:20:05.357 --> 03:20:15.518]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[03:20:27.801 --> 03:20:33.004]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[03:20:53.475 --> 03:20:57.038]  Again, go to 5starsoap.com and just try their products.
[03:20:57.038 --> 03:20:57.979]  You're gonna love them.
[03:20:57.979 --> 03:21:01.822]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:21:01.822 --> 03:21:07.526]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:21:07.526 --> 03:21:08.847]  And we knew what to do.
[03:21:08.847 --> 03:21:10.568]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:21:10.834 --> 03:21:17.879]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:21:17.879 --> 03:21:26.405]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:21:26.772 --> 03:21:33.874]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:21:33.874 --> 03:21:37.035]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:21:37.035 --> 03:21:42.817]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:21:42.817 --> 03:21:45.898]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:21:45.898 --> 03:21:51.940]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:21:51.940 --> 03:21:53.961]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:21:54.861 --> 03:22:01.344]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:22:01.344 --> 03:22:08.007]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:08.007 --> 03:22:16.131]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:16.131 --> 03:22:21.714]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[03:22:22.034 --> 03:22:24.296]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[03:22:24.296 --> 03:22:29.400]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:29.400 --> 03:22:34.604]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:34.604 --> 03:22:38.968]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:38.968 --> 03:22:40.049]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:40.049 --> 03:22:44.552]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[03:22:49.436 --> 03:22:52.440]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[03:23:00.828 --> 03:23:02.589]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:23:02.589 --> 03:23:04.111]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:23:04.111 --> 03:23:05.432]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:23:05.432 --> 03:23:07.373]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:23:07.373 --> 03:23:16.180]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:23:16.180 --> 03:23:21.444]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:23:21.584 --> 03:23:23.386]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:23:23.386 --> 03:23:30.873]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[03:24:04.049 --> 03:24:06.271]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:24:06.271 --> 03:24:09.154]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:24:09.154 --> 03:24:11.156]  Those are the two big twin motherships.
[03:24:11.156 --> 03:24:14.779]  And we have the auxiliary attack frigates in the InfoWars.
[03:24:14.779 --> 03:24:16.681]  InfoWars.net.
[03:24:16.681 --> 03:24:18.143]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:24:18.143 --> 03:24:20.345]  JonesReport.com.
[03:24:20.345 --> 03:24:23.128]  WhatIsTheEndGame.com.
[03:24:23.128 --> 03:24:24.189]  The list goes on and on.
[03:24:24.189 --> 03:24:25.550]  FollowTheRepublic.com.
[03:24:27.674 --> 03:24:32.518]  TheObamadeception.net and about 20 other sites or more.
[03:24:32.518 --> 03:24:38.243]  We did that because we get attacked and hacked over the years and my rule is I start more websites when I'm attacked.
[03:24:38.243 --> 03:24:41.786]  And I mean bonafide real attacks.
[03:24:41.786 --> 03:24:43.507]  Alan Watt, always amazing to interview him.
[03:24:43.507 --> 03:24:45.409]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com.
[03:24:45.409 --> 03:24:47.891]  What are some of the other backup sites you've got as well, Alan?
[03:24:49.028 --> 03:24:53.392]  I've got a whole bunch there, because the same thing happens.
[03:24:53.392 --> 03:24:54.633]  In fact, it's through Yahoo.
[03:24:54.633 --> 03:24:59.817]  Yahoo pulls them once in a while for two weeks at a time, or three weeks.
[03:24:59.817 --> 03:25:04.021]  I'm the only person on the planet that can't find out what's wrong, what the problem is.
[03:25:04.944 --> 03:25:05.124]  Good.
[03:25:05.124 --> 03:25:06.845]  Okay, let's go to some phone calls.
[03:25:06.845 --> 03:25:08.765]  Let's talk to Robert in West Virginia.
[03:25:08.765 --> 03:25:09.826]  Robert, you're on the air.
[03:25:37.034 --> 03:25:39.797]  Okay, Shelly in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:25:39.797 --> 03:25:41.478]  Go ahead, Shelly.
[03:25:41.478 --> 03:25:50.827]  Hi Alex, I spoke to you a couple of days ago and I was telling you about my son that I just enrolled in school and I wanted to find out what I could do as far as the vaccine and everything.
[03:25:50.827 --> 03:25:53.149]  I live right outside of Houston.
[03:25:53.149 --> 03:25:57.954]  I went to my son's nurse yesterday and asked her for the vaccine exemption form.
[03:25:58.547 --> 03:26:00.227]  She said she has nothing like that.
[03:26:00.227 --> 03:26:02.088]  She didn't want to give me any information.
[03:26:02.088 --> 03:26:02.868]  She's a liar.
[03:26:02.868 --> 03:26:03.568]  Basically.
[03:26:03.568 --> 03:26:04.228]  Understatement.
[03:26:04.228 --> 03:26:06.268]  You have to go to the health department.
[03:26:06.268 --> 03:26:08.229]  Let's do this live on TV right now.
[03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:24.872]  Guys, Google Texas vaccine exemption form and we will be on the state health department and you just print it off and you mail it in and if the criminals at that school who get money for shooting your kid up, their federal funds are almost exclusively tied to that.
[03:26:24.872 --> 03:26:26.432]  It's so important the government wants that.
[03:26:27.757 --> 03:26:35.720]  That you then go in and you give it to them and then they're open for massive criminal charges if they try to kick your child out.
[03:26:35.720 --> 03:26:41.122]  But see, their criminal charges on your child are for truancy when they kick them out.
[03:26:41.122 --> 03:26:43.783]  That's what they talk about arresting you for shots.
[03:26:44.727 --> 03:26:46.968]  They're total criminals!
[03:26:46.968 --> 03:26:49.829]  So, there it is, okay?
[03:26:49.829 --> 03:26:57.492]  There is the state of Texas, Texas vaccine exemption form, and you just Google that, and you can print the form off.
[03:26:57.492 --> 03:27:00.733]  Secure online request for exemption affidavit.
[03:27:00.733 --> 03:27:06.716]  And there's copies of them online, but I guess here, the state's now making you ask to screw it up, but they've got to give it to you.
[03:27:07.857 --> 03:27:08.458]  I'm sorry, man.
[03:27:08.458 --> 03:27:09.199]  I don't mean to get mad.
[03:27:09.199 --> 03:27:11.301]  I'm just so tired of lying criminals.
[03:27:11.301 --> 03:27:17.066]  But again, this evil woman or man, they feel like it's good, like a death camp operator.
[03:27:17.066 --> 03:27:20.029]  Oh, they're helping by lying to you.
[03:27:20.029 --> 03:27:22.271]  And believe me, a school nurse knows they're lying.
[03:27:22.271 --> 03:27:22.732]  Alan what?
[03:27:23.735 --> 03:27:24.956]  Yes, they do.
[03:27:24.956 --> 03:27:28.478]  Some true believers in the profession are brainwashed themselves.
[03:27:28.478 --> 03:27:29.578]  In fact, the big boys say that.
[03:27:29.578 --> 03:27:33.521]  The first ones you have to brainwash are the ones who manage the rest of the public.
[03:27:33.521 --> 03:27:40.845]  And a lot of them truly believe it, but there's a lot of nurses, too, that understand the effects of inoculations.
[03:27:40.845 --> 03:27:44.227]  Yeah, that's why close to 60% are saying no in New York.
[03:27:44.227 --> 03:27:44.707]  Shelley!
[03:27:44.707 --> 03:27:45.808]  In New York State, actually.
[03:27:45.808 --> 03:27:47.149]  This is the thing with New York State.
[03:27:47.669 --> 03:27:59.806]  They made it a policy, the big board that controls the health authority for New York State, a policy, and they said in the policy there will be no exemptions for religious or philosophical or even diabetic reasons.
[03:28:00.519 --> 03:28:03.881]  Uh, for the first time in their history, they've actually brought diabetics.
[03:28:03.881 --> 03:28:10.245]  Yeah, even if you're a doctor, because this is key, you can find an anti-vaccine doctor by googling it in any major city.
[03:28:10.245 --> 03:28:12.206]  If you're in a small town, you may have to go to a big city.
[03:28:12.206 --> 03:28:16.789]  They will give you a medical exemption and they admit on the flu shots hundreds of things.
[03:28:16.789 --> 03:28:22.633]  If you've got allergies, you're not supposed to take shots because they admit that it is going to cause an autoimmune response.
[03:28:23.753 --> 03:28:27.416]  But now they're trying to say, we don't care if the medical doctor says no.
[03:28:27.416 --> 03:28:29.638]  We got SWAT teams who want to kill.
[03:28:29.638 --> 03:28:30.758]  They want blood.
[03:28:30.758 --> 03:28:32.280]  Take the cancer shot.
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:34.861]  Shelly, what are you facing right now?
[03:28:34.861 --> 03:28:42.087]  I called the immunization branch there in Austin, and the lady laughed at me yesterday on the phone.
[03:28:42.087 --> 03:28:44.108]  She said there is no exemption form.
[03:28:44.108 --> 03:28:46.290]  I was asking specifically for the swine flu.
[03:28:47.094 --> 03:28:51.836]  Um, and she said- Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, Obama's been on TV saying you don't have to take it.
[03:28:51.836 --> 03:28:55.558]  Okay, so she told you you have to?
[03:28:55.558 --> 03:29:04.862]  No, she said that it's not mandatory and there is no form that I can file- But then let me guess, Houston's trying to force you to take it though?
[03:29:04.862 --> 03:29:05.723]  That I don't know.
[03:29:06.519 --> 03:29:06.879]  I'm hearing a lot.
[03:29:06.879 --> 03:29:08.000]  It's a form of double think.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:11.742]  When you get into this double think, we can believe two opposing ideas at the same time.
[03:29:34.917 --> 03:29:36.819]  Then you can't think rationally for yourselves.
[03:29:36.819 --> 03:29:38.341]  You give up and go along with them.
[03:29:38.341 --> 03:29:39.682]  That's what most folks do.
[03:29:39.682 --> 03:29:40.743]  They give up and go along.
[03:29:40.743 --> 03:29:41.143]  Yeah.
[03:29:41.143 --> 03:29:41.584]  Stay there, Alan.
[03:29:41.584 --> 03:29:43.425]  I want to hear more from you, Mark, and others.
[03:29:43.425 --> 03:29:44.947]  Shelley, look.
[03:29:44.947 --> 03:29:46.649]  The General Vaccine Forum.
[03:29:46.649 --> 03:29:48.851]  Your kid's not taking vaccines, okay?
[03:29:48.851 --> 03:29:51.713]  Period.
[03:29:51.713 --> 03:29:53.095]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.095 --> 03:29:54.716]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.716 --> 03:29:58.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.203 --> 03:30:05.444]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.444 --> 03:30:07.444]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.444 --> 03:30:15.966]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.966 --> 03:30:21.508]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.508 --> 03:30:23.128]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.368 --> 03:30:29.893]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.893 --> 03:30:40.942]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.942 --> 03:30:42.323]  That's right, clean water.
[03:30:42.583 --> 03:30:42.983]  We're good to go.
[03:31:04.483 --> 03:31:07.985]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[03:31:07.985 --> 03:31:10.305]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[03:31:10.305 --> 03:31:18.649]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[03:31:18.649 --> 03:31:26.092]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[03:31:26.092 --> 03:31:32.935]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[03:31:33.470 --> 03:31:37.811]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[03:31:37.811 --> 03:31:41.792]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[03:31:41.792 --> 03:31:44.053]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[03:31:44.053 --> 03:31:48.494]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[03:33:07.501 --> 03:33:10.042]  Alright, I didn't mean to go off into a rant.
[03:33:10.042 --> 03:33:15.144]  I was just talking to one of my producers, one of the radio guys, Rob Dew, about how they
[03:33:33.530 --> 03:33:37.876]  And his wife's in education, how they tried for months to get it in the exemption form.
[03:33:37.876 --> 03:33:40.420]  They would laugh and say it doesn't exist.
[03:33:40.420 --> 03:33:43.965]  Up until a month ago, you could always just print it off online.
[03:33:43.965 --> 03:33:45.828]  Now I guess they make you get one from them.
[03:33:45.828 --> 03:33:46.729]  They're real bastards.
[03:33:47.831 --> 03:33:51.973]  Uh, but, uh, going back to Alan Watt before we continue with calls.
[03:33:51.973 --> 03:33:54.754]  Yeah, there's always these little ring-around-the-rosie games.
[03:33:54.754 --> 03:33:55.914]  It's in the Dallas Morning News.
[03:33:55.914 --> 03:34:00.596]  They're kicking kids out if they don't take the regular shot, seasonal flu, and the new one.
[03:34:00.596 --> 03:34:03.297]  I mean, I showed Dallas Morning News yesterday.
[03:34:03.297 --> 03:34:05.778]  Austin's announcing it, but there's no law.
[03:34:05.778 --> 03:34:07.819]  They're saying you don't have to, but you have to.
[03:34:08.579 --> 03:34:13.140]  And then you say, well, I want an exemption form and they laugh at you and say, you don't have to, honey.
[03:34:13.140 --> 03:34:15.420]  I mean, this is just so sick.
[03:34:15.420 --> 03:34:20.621]  And these locals, they always get like a little piggy face, a little demonic smile.
[03:34:20.621 --> 03:34:25.882]  What is that programming where they revel in abusing people, they revel in lying?
[03:34:25.882 --> 03:34:32.883]  Yeah, what you've got really is what has been said about the Soviet system and the hero worship of the man at the top.
[03:34:32.883 --> 03:34:35.784]  The same with the Nazi regime in Germany.
[03:34:37.120 --> 03:34:40.744]  What they found was that all the officers down below are sadomasochists.
[03:34:40.744 --> 03:34:42.586]  And this is how power works.
[03:34:42.586 --> 03:34:47.531]  It's a sadomasochistic thing that attracts psychopathic types into those positions.
[03:34:47.531 --> 03:34:49.473]  In fact, you're generally the only ones who go into them.
[03:34:50.376 --> 03:34:58.182]  And they worship the person above them with power and they despise the person beneath them who has less power than themselves.
[03:34:58.182 --> 03:35:01.164]  That's how simply it works with sadomasochism.
[03:35:01.164 --> 03:35:08.970]  And you'll always have the strange sadomasochistic authoritarianism when you get into politics and right down to local politics even.
[03:35:08.970 --> 03:35:10.331]  Any authority.
[03:35:10.331 --> 03:35:14.414]  This is the very thing that Carol Young warned the public about back in the 50s.
[03:35:16.075 --> 03:35:29.880]  He talked about the Iron Curtain across Germany, but he also said, he says, I see an Iron Curtain of massive bureaucracies building up with governmental agencies, stifling and strangling the freedom of the whole planet.
[03:35:29.880 --> 03:35:32.781]  He understood what was coming down the pike back then.
[03:35:32.781 --> 03:35:37.223]  Many of his generation did, in fact, because they were involved in meeting high-level people.
[03:35:37.998 --> 03:35:43.361]  And he knew that the world we're bringing in would be one of tyranny by force.
[03:35:43.361 --> 03:35:44.622]  And that's what you've got.
[03:35:44.622 --> 03:35:52.167]  One of the criteria of tyranny is when you're forced into a position by authorities without any escape routes.
[03:35:52.167 --> 03:35:54.168]  In other words, you have no choice.
[03:35:54.168 --> 03:35:57.030]  That is tyranny, when you have no choice in any situation.
[03:36:00.282 --> 03:36:02.885]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:36:02.885 --> 03:36:07.309]  Since they don't have a choice, they learn to love it and love to defend it.
[03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:11.353]  And so when you say, hey, the banks just stole $23.7 trillion.
[03:36:11.353 --> 03:36:13.996]  We got to pay it back with interest.
[03:36:13.996 --> 03:36:17.960]  They just laugh and will say, I'm part of the power structure.
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:20.722]  And it's almost like a five-year-old dressing up like they're
[03:36:21.727 --> 03:36:27.370]  Luke Skywalker dressing up like they're some hero.
[03:36:27.370 --> 03:36:33.353]  It's like the public are eternal children and they imagine things.
[03:36:33.353 --> 03:36:36.455]  They're delusional.
[03:36:36.455 --> 03:36:41.178]  And I never had a view of myself as something special or wonderful or good.
[03:36:41.178 --> 03:36:43.359]  I'm just a person that has my instincts intact.
[03:36:44.079 --> 03:36:51.866]  And, you know, having a bunch of psychos writing books about how they're killing me with vaccines and stuff in the water, and then I can see the evidence they're doing it?
[03:36:51.866 --> 03:37:09.042]  I mean, if they write hundreds of books about how they're killing us and how it's a scientific dictatorship, wouldn't there be something wrong with me if I didn't, as a red-blooded male, not stand up for my species against a power-tripping group that's playing God?
[03:37:09.873 --> 03:37:10.473]  Absolutely.
[03:37:10.473 --> 03:37:19.836]  And part of the key of obedience, as I say, Stanford and other universities are into these experiments all the time around obedience, so are the CIA involved with them, obviously.
[03:37:19.836 --> 03:37:24.538]  And what they find is, with the more power they accumulate in any agency,
[03:37:25.613 --> 03:37:34.281]  In this sadomasochistic power structure, they begin to despise the ordinary people who begin to cow under authority.
[03:37:34.281 --> 03:37:41.608]  The more the people cow under authority, the more they're despised as almost weaklings, and eventually hated by those in power.
[03:37:41.608 --> 03:37:46.513]  I've always said it's like a farmer breaking the legs of a cow.
[03:37:46.513 --> 03:37:49.956]  It falls to the ground, then he starts kicking it because it can't get up.
[03:37:50.518 --> 03:38:01.204]  Well, I think that one of the most effective ways to attack it is to just show people the matrix of false reality and reach out to police, military, bureaucrats and go,
[03:38:13.911 --> 03:38:16.353]  You know, your little cousin just died of cancer at 22.
[03:38:16.353 --> 03:38:18.315]  That's not normal.
[03:38:18.315 --> 03:38:19.876]  Here's some statistics.
[03:38:19.876 --> 03:38:21.317]  Do you know what's in the water?
[03:38:21.317 --> 03:38:23.158]  Do you know what's in the shots?
[03:38:23.158 --> 03:38:28.823]  Here's AP admitting they're giving everyone polio with the polio vaccine.
[03:38:28.823 --> 03:38:33.046]  And you're not going to listen now because you have defenses up.
[03:38:33.046 --> 03:38:36.629]  But deep down in your instincts, you know I'm telling you the truth.
[03:38:36.629 --> 03:38:37.930]  You're being manipulated.
[03:38:37.930 --> 03:38:43.335]  And I found that six months down the road, a year down the road, they then wake up.
[03:38:44.424 --> 03:38:53.972]  And just showing them how they're not in the power structure like they think they are, how they're being attacked as well.
[03:38:53.972 --> 03:39:04.281]  It was interesting to see this new world order is to go through a series of changes, including the riot phase for 30 odd years as they bring down the food supply.
[03:39:04.281 --> 03:39:11.467]  And then the United Nations takes over the distribution of food to all the different regions, as they call these sections of the world.
[03:39:11.467 --> 03:39:12.588]  And they say in their own writings,
[03:39:13.232 --> 03:39:13.532]  I think?
[03:39:37.142 --> 03:39:39.164]  We're being killed off by inoculations.
[03:39:39.164 --> 03:39:46.289]  And that's all stated and they all brag about it and you'll tell some mom and she'll arrogantly laugh at you.
[03:39:46.289 --> 03:39:53.194]  Take her kid who already looks like a zombie and just shoot him up with some more and then they'll look at you with pleasure.
[03:39:53.194 --> 03:39:54.855]  You crazy nut!
[03:39:54.855 --> 03:39:56.297]  It doesn't matter if you just quoted
[03:39:57.057 --> 03:39:58.318]  State Department memorandum 200.
[03:39:58.318 --> 03:39:59.159]  Yes.
[03:39:59.159 --> 03:40:01.340]  It doesn't matter if you're quoting UN documents.
[03:40:01.340 --> 03:40:02.121]  It doesn't matter.
[03:40:02.121 --> 03:40:04.143]  They don't care.
[03:40:04.143 --> 03:40:09.887]  And then when their kid dies, they'll wear a little cancer ribbon and cry, and it's like a celebrity thing.
[03:40:09.887 --> 03:40:12.109]  Oh, your kid died too!
[03:40:12.109 --> 03:40:13.370]  Ooh!
[03:40:13.370 --> 03:40:13.970]  Ooh!
[03:40:13.970 --> 03:40:16.632]  You know, because it's all about euthanizing everybody.
[03:40:16.632 --> 03:40:18.053]  That's what this is all about.
[03:40:18.053 --> 03:40:21.456]  It is euthanasia, and it's a bacterial warfare.
[03:40:21.456 --> 03:40:22.997]  It's viral warfare.
[03:40:22.997 --> 03:40:25.079]  It's bio-warfare, carefully designed.
[03:40:25.900 --> 03:40:32.282]  And all this stuff has been released recently from internal meetings at the World Health Organization.
[03:40:32.282 --> 03:40:43.807]  They admit that all of these particles of DNA and RNA and so on recombine within the body and infect the cells of the person and cause cancers down the road.
[03:40:43.807 --> 03:40:44.667]  They understand this.
[03:40:44.667 --> 03:40:51.790]  Well, they grow it in the exact type of monkeys and fetal tissue that have the cancer virus that's most deadly in it.
[03:40:52.950 --> 03:41:02.976]  Well, actually, they've said now, they've stated now, that they're actually using, especially for this new swine flu, rather than use the eggs, chicken eggs, and so on, for doing so, which also contains thousands of foreign viruses.
[03:41:02.976 --> 03:41:13.163]  They're using cancer virus instead of the dead baby retinas, or the green monkey kidneys, or the other growth mediums.
[03:41:13.163 --> 03:41:13.903]  You're right.
[03:41:13.903 --> 03:41:16.205]  They're using cancer virus.
[03:41:16.205 --> 03:41:19.587]  That's what they say, because the cancer virus is a survivor, so they're using that
[03:41:21.808 --> 03:41:23.428]  Is it that sweet?
[03:41:23.428 --> 03:41:25.029]  I'm going to move the calls quickly now.
[03:41:25.029 --> 03:41:26.269]  Mark in Oregon.
[03:41:26.269 --> 03:41:27.030]  You're on the air.
[03:41:27.030 --> 03:41:28.610]  Go ahead.
[03:41:28.610 --> 03:41:29.891]  Hi Alex and Alan.
[03:41:29.891 --> 03:41:31.151]  Honored to speak with you.
[03:41:31.151 --> 03:41:32.672]  Thank you for your great information.
[03:41:32.672 --> 03:41:36.033]  Thank you for your great wisdom, even.
[03:41:36.033 --> 03:41:43.956]  Alex, on Monday's show, you had mentioned that there were 10 million doses of the flu mask being sent out into the country on Monday.
[03:41:43.956 --> 03:41:47.177]  They will have arrived, or probably have arrived, at the destination by now, I'm sure.
[03:41:48.211 --> 03:41:51.513]  Destinations that it's arriving to are the Walmart stores.
[03:41:51.513 --> 03:42:15.985]  Well let me be clear, they said last Friday that 200,000 were going to Tennessee, Indiana, and Texas, and that then by the end of the next week, 10 million more would start flowing, and then they admit there's been no testing of the H1N1, and that they're making people sign secrecy forms and waiving their rights when they take the nasal.
[03:42:15.985 --> 03:42:16.145]  Yes.
[03:42:16.752 --> 03:42:24.034]  You also reported, Alex, the Mayo Clinic has come out and said that the flu mist will be much more contagious to other people.
[03:42:24.034 --> 03:42:33.537]  It takes 10 to 20 days, as I understand it at this point, for the actual symptoms to manifest in someone who has received an injected or a flu mist vaccination.
[03:42:33.537 --> 03:42:39.859]  Now, I think the time clock has already started on this and that the actual mass murder
[03:42:41.164 --> 03:42:42.285]  Well I know this.
[03:42:42.285 --> 03:42:43.425]  We're going to find out.
[03:43:03.171 --> 03:43:16.463]  By the end of October, early November, whether it's meant to mutate and really be deadly, or if this is just setting the precedent for us to go under World Health Organization rules and to set the precedent to take the shots as they've stated.
[03:43:16.463 --> 03:43:18.605]  We know it's at least that bad.
[03:43:18.605 --> 03:43:20.087]  Alan Watt, what do you think's going on?
[03:43:21.241 --> 03:43:21.781]  It's true.
[03:43:21.781 --> 03:43:24.023]  I think it fulfills both purposes.
[03:43:24.023 --> 03:43:27.485]  You become a human incubator when you take on this stuff.
[03:43:27.485 --> 03:43:29.126]  You are now the new egg, if you like.
[03:43:29.126 --> 03:43:31.608]  You're the new reactor as it breathes within you.
[03:43:31.608 --> 03:43:35.150]  And they admit you shed the virus to all those around you.
[03:43:35.150 --> 03:43:37.252]  There's no doubt about that.
[03:43:37.252 --> 03:43:42.235]  And what's interesting to me is putting this kind of thing into a mist form
[03:43:43.012 --> 03:43:43.272]  I think?
[03:44:01.650 --> 03:44:04.931]  Right into the lung area, which may cause you to die.
[03:44:04.931 --> 03:44:13.914]  For those that don't know, that's the autoimmune storm of how the 1918 killed tens of millions.
[03:44:13.914 --> 03:44:19.635]  It's the autoimmune response to the virus that kills you in hours with fluid.
[03:44:19.635 --> 03:44:24.077]  And now we're getting reports, they're covering it up, that people are taking it and collapsing.
[03:44:24.077 --> 03:44:27.077]  And so, Alan, I want to be very clear about what you just said.
[03:44:27.077 --> 03:44:28.758]  They admit in the literature
[03:44:29.518 --> 03:44:32.821]  That it can cause the autoimmune response, and you're right.
[03:44:32.821 --> 03:44:47.953]  You're injecting live virus into the nasal passages, into the lungs, which can then cause the autoimmune response, and Reuters is out ahead of it saying there's going to be lots of deaths after you take the shot, but it's not the shot.
[03:44:47.953 --> 03:44:49.214]  Now how obvious is that?
[03:44:50.267 --> 03:44:52.250]  Yes, it's very obvious.
[03:44:52.250 --> 03:44:58.840]  And again, it's twofold, as you say, that it is to train us to take the annual shots and boosters for the rest of our lives.
[03:44:58.840 --> 03:45:01.043]  That's what they said at the World Health Organization 2006 meeting.
[03:45:04.665 --> 03:45:12.532]  Alright, I hope you're wrong, Mark, but we at least know they're setting the precedent for the big soft kill that's coming, but we're going to find out in the next few months here, buddy.
[03:45:12.532 --> 03:45:14.054]  It doesn't look good, I'll say that.
[03:45:14.054 --> 03:45:18.097]  I mean, they admit it's live virus they're putting into 10 million morons.
[03:45:18.097 --> 03:45:20.519]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Arkansas.
[03:45:20.519 --> 03:45:21.520]  John, you're on the air.
[03:45:21.520 --> 03:45:21.961]  Go ahead.
[03:45:21.961 --> 03:45:23.542]  Hi, Alex.
[03:45:23.542 --> 03:45:24.643]  This is John.
[03:45:24.643 --> 03:45:30.809]  I spoke to you about the police stopping me and trying to get me to take the shot.
[03:45:32.031 --> 03:45:34.052]  Yeah, tell us about that again.
[03:45:34.052 --> 03:45:37.593]  Expand on that.
[03:45:37.593 --> 03:45:45.076]  Yes, I was on my way home from a girlfriend's house and a police officer here in Little Rock stopped me and he was like, hey, how you doing?
[03:45:45.076 --> 03:45:46.676]  And he was like, it's a little late to be out.
[03:45:46.676 --> 03:45:47.637]  And I was like, yeah, it's okay.
[03:45:47.637 --> 03:45:49.057]  I'm just coming from my girlfriend's house.
[03:45:49.057 --> 03:45:50.038]  Oh, it's a free country.
[03:45:50.038 --> 03:45:52.198]  You know, the guy's got to ask you why you're out at night.
[03:45:52.198 --> 03:45:53.179]  You know, you're a slave.
[03:45:53.179 --> 03:45:54.659]  Go ahead.
[03:45:54.659 --> 03:45:58.121]  And he was like, so have you gotten your flu shot yet?
[03:45:58.121 --> 03:45:58.821]  I said, no.
[03:45:59.414 --> 03:46:00.414]  And he said, why not?
[03:46:00.414 --> 03:46:06.337]  I said, because that's government propaganda, and it contains mercury, which kills you!
[03:46:06.337 --> 03:46:12.039]  And he looked at me kind of crazy, so he said, so you're going to probably spat out some New World order crap, huh?
[03:46:12.039 --> 03:46:15.840]  I said, yeah, I was kind of thinking that, and kind of telling you to fuck off right about now.
[03:46:15.840 --> 03:46:17.661]  All right, I'm going to let you go, sir.
[03:46:17.661 --> 03:46:20.662]  I understand that happened to you, but we really need to remember we have a lot of children listening.
[03:46:20.662 --> 03:46:22.783]  Okay, buddy?
[03:46:22.783 --> 03:46:25.084]  No more for that caller.
[03:46:25.084 --> 03:46:26.784]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[03:46:26.784 --> 03:46:27.625]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:46:27.625 --> 03:46:28.005]  Go ahead.
[03:46:29.431 --> 03:46:31.252]  Hey guys, can you hear me alright?
[03:46:31.252 --> 03:46:33.973]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:46:33.973 --> 03:46:41.117]  I've just been... This is in regards to, I guess, more of the eugenic kind of stuff that you guys are talking about.
[03:46:41.117 --> 03:46:51.082]  I studied Soviet Union history and politics when I was in university, and we covered the Aral Sea.
[03:46:51.082 --> 03:46:54.863]  A lot of the genetic mutations and aberrations that
[03:46:56.334 --> 03:46:57.375]  We're good to go.
[03:47:13.982 --> 03:47:15.944]  Incredibly good point.
[03:47:15.944 --> 03:47:28.555]  Let me briefly say that they've done studies where over 90 percent, I want to say 97 but you can pull it up, of people in India of the sewage systems have the SV40 live cancer virus.
[03:47:28.555 --> 03:47:30.317]  They don't just inject this in people.
[03:47:30.317 --> 03:47:34.501]  It then spreads and mutates in us as incubators as Alan was saying.
[03:47:34.501 --> 03:47:38.645]  Now, I've interviewed genetic engineer after genetic engineer, guys making millions a year.
[03:47:39.165 --> 03:47:47.907]  Guys who were running whole facilities and they would find that they would be told by other engineers they were just running plants to make the potato this way, the tomato that way.
[03:47:49.187 --> 03:48:06.273]  Insert this gene, and they noticed, we've had them on the show over and over again, that it was a combination change that would change other things and produce a pharmacological crop, that's what it's called, pharmacological crops, that would also sterilize all the guinea pigs and rats they tested it on.
[03:48:06.273 --> 03:48:16.877]  And so yes, and that's what they've said, they're gonna have food crops, they already have them, with vaccines in them, with live viruses in them, and that the very GMO, it's already going on.
[03:48:16.877 --> 03:48:17.317]  Alan, what?
[03:48:18.031 --> 03:48:19.758]  Yes, I also have the information.
[03:48:19.758 --> 03:48:22.993]  It's up on websites by the United Nations that they're into crops.
[03:48:23.944 --> 03:48:34.171]  For the last 15 years, for third world countries especially, all kinds of stuff, including corn, that would actually help sterilize the people and bring down the population rate.
[03:48:34.171 --> 03:48:43.157]  You find Rockefeller himself is in charge of the rice campaign, the Golden Rice campaign, that's doing a lot of modified rice, too, for all these countries.
[03:48:43.157 --> 03:48:46.879]  It's now being imported back into the US and other countries, too.
[03:48:46.879 --> 03:48:49.861]  This stuff also was designed to lower the sperm in the males, etc.
[03:48:53.499 --> 03:48:58.160]  That's stuff on their own side.
[03:48:58.160 --> 03:49:03.061]  Alan, I was going to do some financial news in the final segment, but I want to hold you to the very end so we can take a few more calls.
[03:49:03.061 --> 03:49:04.101]  Are you game for that?
[03:49:04.101 --> 03:49:04.721]  Yes.
[03:49:04.721 --> 03:49:05.902]  Ten more minutes, okay.
[03:49:05.902 --> 03:49:07.342]  Let's take another call here.
[03:49:07.342 --> 03:49:09.382]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[03:49:09.382 --> 03:49:11.763]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:49:11.763 --> 03:49:12.563]  We'll just talk to Mike.
[03:49:12.563 --> 03:49:13.943]  Lloyd in Connecticut, sorry.
[03:49:13.943 --> 03:49:14.603]  Lloyd, go ahead.
[03:49:14.603 --> 03:49:16.124]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:49:16.124 --> 03:49:17.184]  Good.
[03:49:17.184 --> 03:49:21.945]  A friend of mine's wife works for a big HMO, you know.
[03:49:23.098 --> 03:49:38.830]  in three years ago they had a meeting and they discussed the flu and her husband got so paranoid he went out and bought dried food so you know how can they know that far in advance unless it's planned you know
[03:49:39.443 --> 03:49:48.270]  Sir, in January, we had emergency managers on and in documents from major states where they were saying in November, December, millions were going to die.
[03:49:48.270 --> 03:49:49.391]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[03:49:49.391 --> 03:49:54.696]  The feds were telling police departments, the citizens will attack you in the winter.
[03:49:54.696 --> 03:49:57.578]  So, they're clearly getting ready for something.
[03:49:57.578 --> 03:49:58.859]  They're testing the water?
[03:49:58.859 --> 03:50:00.100]  I don't know.
[03:50:00.100 --> 03:50:02.422]  But yes, this is all pre-planned.
[03:50:02.422 --> 03:50:02.863]  Alan, what?
[03:50:03.599 --> 03:50:05.200]  There's no doubt about it, too.
[03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:16.847]  In fact, they were into talking to John Holdren when he wrote that book, Ecoscience, along with the other big eugenicists and ecologists, which we call the population experts.
[03:50:16.847 --> 03:50:22.730]  They admitted then they'd have to find ways of putting things in the water and the food, and that was, what, 30-odd years ago.
[03:50:22.730 --> 03:50:28.073]  And you can go further back again into the Huxleys talking about the same thing, and Russell's putting stuff in the food.
[03:50:28.073 --> 03:50:30.695]  But Bertrand Russell, Lord Bertrand Russell in charge,
[03:50:39.719 --> 03:50:50.925]  Many cases, folks, when these hospitals kill your family, your kids, just remember who did it, the New World Order.
[03:50:50.925 --> 03:50:53.706]  They think you're stupid, they think you're not going to notice what's happening.
[03:50:53.706 --> 03:50:54.487]  Final segment.
[03:50:54.487 --> 03:50:56.308]  Lloyd, stay there for comments from you as well.
[03:50:56.308 --> 03:50:56.868]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:01.673 --> 03:51:07.560]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:51:07.560 --> 03:51:12.687]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:51:12.687 --> 03:51:13.908]  That was then.
[03:51:13.908 --> 03:51:15.210]  This is now.
[03:51:15.210 --> 03:51:17.393]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:51:17.913 --> 03:51:23.976]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:51:23.976 --> 03:51:33.181]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:51:33.181 --> 03:51:35.923]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:51:36.643 --> 03:51:41.127]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:51:41.127 --> 03:51:42.648]  Video never lies.
[03:51:42.648 --> 03:51:44.310]  Watch Big Brother back.
[03:51:44.310 --> 03:51:46.091]  Visit Diginet.net.
[03:51:46.091 --> 03:51:49.054]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[03:51:49.054 --> 03:51:51.676]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[03:51:51.676 --> 03:51:53.357]  Diginet dot net.
[03:51:53.357 --> 03:51:53.838]  Or call 1-888-344-6681.
[03:51:53.838 --> 03:51:54.058]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[03:52:02.006 --> 03:52:07.809]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.809 --> 03:52:15.393]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.393 --> 03:52:21.557]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.977 --> 03:52:23.958]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.958 --> 03:52:26.459]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.459 --> 03:52:38.023]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.023 --> 03:52:39.704]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.704 --> 03:52:41.565]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.565 --> 03:52:47.787]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.473 --> 03:52:56.729]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.729 --> 03:52:58.312]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.312 --> 03:52:59.514]  The people strike back!
[03:53:02.907 --> 03:53:04.908]  Remain in your houses.
[03:53:04.908 --> 03:53:10.670]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:53:10.670 --> 03:53:12.031]  Will they do it?
[03:53:12.031 --> 03:53:14.652]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:53:14.652 --> 03:53:20.594]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:53:21.112 --> 03:53:23.293]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:53:23.293 --> 03:53:27.575]  Executive Order 10-9-90 locks down all highways.
[03:53:27.575 --> 03:53:32.457]  Executive Order 10-9-95 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:53:32.457 --> 03:53:37.379]  Executive Order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:53:37.379 --> 03:53:42.201]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:53:43.121 --> 03:53:51.547]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:53:51.547 --> 03:53:54.029]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:53:54.029 --> 03:53:57.091]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:53:57.091 --> 03:54:06.817]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:54:06.817 --> 03:54:08.318]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[03:54:08.318 --> 03:54:09.039]  to 3 p.m.
[03:54:09.039 --> 03:54:11.961]  Central, we're here just trying to warn people, and like Alan Watts said,
[03:54:13.442 --> 03:54:17.365]  The biggest issue is to realize they're not talking about killing us in all these publications.
[03:54:17.365 --> 03:54:19.006]  They're doing it.
[03:54:19.006 --> 03:54:21.607]  And you've got to face that horror and read their own statements.
[03:54:21.607 --> 03:54:22.388]  And they've been caught.
[03:54:22.388 --> 03:54:24.229]  The UN's been caught.
[03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:25.610]  The time for games is over.
[03:54:26.857 --> 03:54:29.018]  Get aggressive, there's more of us than there are of them.
[03:54:29.018 --> 03:54:31.939]  CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com is Alan Watts' website.
[03:54:31.939 --> 03:54:34.340]  He is a big part of the new film, Fall of the Republic Vol.
[03:54:34.340 --> 03:54:34.360]  1.
[03:54:34.360 --> 03:54:37.642]  Hope you pre-order it, because it's going to be shipped out in the order it's received.
[03:54:37.642 --> 03:54:40.463]  It's coming out in just 13 days.
[03:54:40.463 --> 03:54:44.145]  Alright, let's go ahead and Lloyd in Connecticut, are you still there?
[03:54:44.145 --> 03:54:46.166]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[03:54:46.166 --> 03:54:50.128]  So you're making the point that, yeah, the internal people are freaking out about the flu.
[03:54:50.128 --> 03:54:50.408]  Go ahead.
[03:54:51.152 --> 03:55:04.264]  You know, when I was a kid, my old man, he wouldn't let us get a shot because everybody in his neighborhood, when he grew up, took the polio vaccine and they were damaged by it and he was terrified of it.
[03:55:04.264 --> 03:55:08.908]  And I've never had the flu and I've never taken a shot.
[03:55:08.908 --> 03:55:12.471]  So, I don't really think they do anything at all.
[03:55:12.471 --> 03:55:13.392]  I think it's just like...
[03:55:14.028 --> 03:55:19.191]  Well, it'd be nice if it was just a scam, but it actually does do something.
[03:55:19.191 --> 03:55:20.832]  I appreciate your call.
[03:55:20.832 --> 03:55:23.293]  Alan, briefly tell him what it does to him.
[03:55:23.293 --> 03:55:32.237]  Well, as you'll note from their own writings, they admit at the top there's thousands of viruses they haven't even identified yet in every shot.
[03:55:32.237 --> 03:55:34.979]  Every shot for everything that they've ever given you.
[03:55:34.979 --> 03:55:39.141]  And this is a recent explanation that they've given out at the top.
[03:55:40.086 --> 03:55:45.828]  But they do know that the ones they have given you definitely not only can but do cause cancers.
[03:55:45.828 --> 03:55:46.968]  They do destroy your organs.
[03:55:46.968 --> 03:55:52.010]  Well, the inventor of the polio vaccine was in a CBC piece admitting it gave everybody cancer.
[03:55:52.010 --> 03:55:53.570]  But it's worse.
[03:55:53.570 --> 03:56:00.712]  Five years ago, the FDA approved, so did England and so did Canada, they spray live viruses.
[03:56:00.712 --> 03:56:03.893]  In Latin it means bacteria-eating virus.
[03:56:03.893 --> 03:56:04.993]  I can't pronounce it.
[03:56:04.993 --> 03:56:06.154]  Bacteriophages, yeah.
[03:56:07.728 --> 03:56:08.669]  Phalange, yeah.
[03:56:08.669 --> 03:56:18.678]  But they grow in these big vaccine tanks with thousands of other viruses, so they spray vaccine, live vaccine, on your meat now.
[03:56:18.678 --> 03:56:20.800]  Yeah, yeah, bacteriophages.
[03:56:20.800 --> 03:56:23.563]  And actually they can kill off most bacteria.
[03:56:23.563 --> 03:56:28.347]  The Soviet Union didn't bother with antibiotics because they had bacteriophages since the 1930s.
[03:56:30.030 --> 03:56:36.792]  That was bought over, that whole, all their pets were bought over by a New York company and it withheld them from the public.
[03:56:36.792 --> 03:56:41.554]  They don't want to give us something that will kill off bacterial infections.
[03:56:41.554 --> 03:56:42.934]  They want us to die off.
[03:56:42.934 --> 03:56:43.935]  That's why they bought the pets over.
[03:56:43.935 --> 03:56:48.016]  And instead it kills the good bacteria so everybody then has intestinal problems.
[03:56:48.016 --> 03:56:48.676]  Yes.
[03:56:48.676 --> 03:56:50.597]  All done scientifically.
[03:56:50.597 --> 03:56:53.218]  Let's cram in one final caller here.
[03:56:53.218 --> 03:56:54.938]  Let's talk to Cheryl in Canada.
[03:56:54.938 --> 03:56:56.179]  You're on the air, go ahead Cheryl.
[03:56:57.142 --> 03:56:59.505]  Mr. Jones, Mr. Watt, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[03:56:59.505 --> 03:57:02.508]  I have two subject matters I'm hoping you can comment on.
[03:57:02.508 --> 03:57:03.269]  Oh, we got a minute and a half.
[03:57:03.269 --> 03:57:09.596]  A great amount of money, or sorry, a great amount of gold disappears out of one of the mints in Canada.
[03:57:09.596 --> 03:57:12.639]  Can you speculate as to why?
[03:57:12.639 --> 03:57:13.901]  Disappears, poof, every month.
[03:57:13.901 --> 03:57:18.546]  Well, a lot of foreign governments are recalling their gold from the West right now, Alan Watt.
[03:57:19.594 --> 03:57:22.318]  Yes, and to be honest with you, we'll never know what happens.
[03:57:22.318 --> 03:57:28.046]  I mean, I watched a documentary where the guys who found the Titanic followed the North Sea route from the U.S.
[03:57:29.142 --> 03:57:29.722]  I don't think so.
[03:57:52.136 --> 03:57:53.676]  Yeah, they just do whatever they want.
[03:57:53.676 --> 03:57:56.097]  The public walks around like a bunch of zombies.
[03:57:56.097 --> 03:57:56.797]  We're out of time.
[03:57:56.797 --> 03:57:59.858]  I appreciate your call, Cheryl and Steve and others.
[03:57:59.858 --> 03:58:02.539]  Call me back tomorrow and then of course Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:02.539 --> 03:58:05.260]  Alan, great job in Follow the Republic.
[03:58:05.260 --> 03:58:06.940]  Great job in everything you're doing.
[03:58:06.940 --> 03:58:09.741]  Folks should support you over there at CuttingTheMatrix.com.
[03:58:09.741 --> 03:58:11.022]  We'll talk to you again real soon.
[03:58:11.022 --> 03:58:12.342]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[03:58:13.018 --> 03:58:13.979]  You bet.
[03:58:13.979 --> 03:58:19.322]  And I want to thank all of our wonderful sponsors, as well, that have made the show possible.
[03:58:19.322 --> 03:58:29.127]  I want to thank the crew in there, Nihart, Hartman, Harmon, everybody else that is in there doing a great job.
[03:58:29.127 --> 03:58:37.332]  The new trailer, the TV Mind Control trailer for Fall of the Republic is live at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[03:58:37.332 --> 03:58:38.913]  Be sure and check it out.
[03:58:38.913 --> 03:58:39.813]  God bless you all.
[03:58:39.813 --> 03:58:41.174]  Retransmission with David Icke.

[03:58:51.283 --> 03:58:54.663]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.663 --> 03:58:58.284]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.284 --> 03:59:02.865]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.865 --> 03:59:08.466]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.746 --> 03:59:13.509]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.509 --> 03:59:17.131]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.131 --> 03:59:21.954]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.954 --> 03:59:28.518]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.518 --> 03:59:30.459]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:30.959 --> 03:59:34.160]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
