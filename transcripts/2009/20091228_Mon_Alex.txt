[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:11.972]  Get a view on what just happened in Copenhagen, and so much more, and on what's happening with the dollar, the pound, the euro, what's happening with gold, to get a lot of different perspectives.
[00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:16.533]  We have Godfrey Bloom, MEP, a member of European Parliament.
[00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:20.113]  His website is godfreybloommep.co.uk.
[00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:21.454]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:22.834]  Great pleasure, Alex.
[00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:24.586]  Good to have you here.
[00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:29.867]  Well, I just played a brief clip of you in the EU standing up to these people.
[00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:33.368]  What is the state of the European Union right now?
[00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:36.629]  Are they angry that their full power grab failed?
[00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:38.849]  Gordon Brown is saying he doesn't care.
[00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:48.431]  He is writing the agreement that the West will pledge money to the IMF and World Bank and UN regardless to these private bankers.
[00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:51.552]  I mean, when does this swindle end?
[00:00:52.858 --> 00:00:54.560]  Well, I'm beginning to wonder, actually.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:04.248]  It's extraordinary that I find that I used to think that the United Kingdom, and to a certain extent Europe, used to follow the United States in a lot of these matters.
[00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:09.133]  And I rather fancy now that we are actually slightly ahead of you.
[00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:13.397]  And I'm watching America make some of the same mistakes that we've been making since 1945.
[00:01:16.127 --> 00:01:34.815]  We've actually handed over our country, the United Kingdom, one of the oldest democracies in the world, has now handed its entire government over to an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels without the will of the British people, without any form of referendum, and without any understanding of what we've been doing.
[00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:42.718]  And it's something that's been a conspiracy between all the major parties in the United Kingdom and all the political
[00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:51.157]  Absolutely.
[00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:52.078]  Just like U.S.
[00:01:52.118 --> 00:01:56.622]  politics, I've studied somewhat the British system, and it's the same thing.
[00:01:57.022 --> 00:02:01.826]  Special globalist interests come in, buy off the two or three or four top parties.
[00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:07.831]  The parties may fight with each other over power, but not over carrying out their master's agenda.
[00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:11.394]  Can you break down how England has been absorbed
[00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:12.975]  Yes, it's quite extraordinary.
[00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:14.015]  In 1975, we had a referendum
[00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:40.497]  And we were told it was called something called the Common Market.
[00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:42.458]  We were told it was a free trade zone.
[00:02:43.259 --> 00:03:06.353]  And of course, being a free economist myself and a global free trader, and a relatively young man at the time in 1975, I voted for it, as a lot of people did, on the basis that we were told quite categorically it wouldn't affect our sovereignty as a nation, it was a free trade area, we'd bring down trade barriers and bureaucracy, and we could all trade with each other and be friends,
[00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:08.636]  And we all thought that was a good idea.
[00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:12.037]  There was no question of there being political union of any sort.
[00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:28.645]  This wasn't on the agenda, and we've seen a sort of salami slicing going on now since 1975, with one treaty after the other, which has taken us towards what we now have, which is a Soviet model.
[00:03:28.705 --> 00:03:29.906]  We have a Soviet model.
[00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:32.807]  Some people try and pretend it's the United States model, but it isn't.
[00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:34.328]  It's a Soviet model.
[00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:55.355]  Where our laws are actually made by an unelected bureaucracy, and I had some of your congressmen over to Brussels who were visiting and I had the pleasure of meeting them a little while ago, just a few weeks ago, and they were absolutely astounded and horrified that the European Parliament doesn't actually make the law, it's an amending chamber.
[00:03:56.396 --> 00:03:58.216]  And so we now have 75% of our laws in England
[00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.737]  Made by an unelected international or European bureaucracy with absolutely no recourse to the British voters.
[00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:10.419]  There's no cost-benefit analysis.
[00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.643]  There's no debate that you would expect to have in our Westminster chamber.
[00:04:15.424 --> 00:04:18.827]  And people feel totally powerless of what's actually happening now.
[00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:26.754]  It's that fewer and fewer people are actually voting at elections because they know it doesn't do any good because their laws are no longer made in London.
[00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:30.293]  Which is what the bureaucrats love.
[00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:33.435]  They love people capitulating, going into a sense of apathy.
[00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:46.365]  But I have to tell you, your party, the UKIP, the UK Independence Party, is certainly rising and a lot of people are losing that apathy and finding out that this illegitimate system can be resisted.
[00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:53.511]  Now, expanding on that with European Union Member of Parliament, Godfrey Bloom, for those that don't know,
[00:04:54.011 --> 00:05:01.358]  Can you explain how this unelected bureaucracy circumvented or circumnavigated the checks and balances?
[00:05:01.678 --> 00:05:02.899]  How they do this by stealth?
[00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.225]  Because I've studied it, but I'm not as big an expert, obviously, as you are, being in the European Parliament, what, for five years.
[00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:17.353]  Because when studying your system, it's very similar and has the very same people involved that are running our North American Union by stealth.
[00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:34.681]  We're just a few decades behind you, but the process of integration is now accelerated here, as it is there, and so by understanding this model, we can then understand how to throw it off, not just in Europe and England, but here in North America as well.
[00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:42.184]  It's extremely difficult, actually, because you, like us, have a two-party system.
[00:05:42.244 --> 00:05:43.924]  We have the Conservatives and Labour.
[00:05:43.964 --> 00:05:45.785]  You have Republicans and Democrats.
[00:05:46.425 --> 00:06:08.690]  It's extremely difficult if the two parties that you have, and that's the sort of democracy that's grown up over the years, you either vote for the Republicans or Democrats over there, we either vote for the Conservative Party or the Labour Party, but what we actually have is the two parties actually agree on the main fundamentals of handing over control to an international political elite.
[00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.492]  And what we've actually built up over the years is a political elite which is totally and utterly divorced
[00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.610]  From the will of ordinary people.
[00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:32.273]  And so when you go into, we go into the pub, you go into bars, or we go into the cricket club, you go into the baseball club, or whatever, you find that ordinary people don't want any of this, but they've been sidelined by professional politicians.
[00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:40.875]  Whereas maybe 200 years ago, certainly in Europe, there was an aristocratic class who ran Europe, now there's a political class
[00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:46.130]  And of course they have complete control over public service broadcasting over here.
[00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:56.375]  The BBC is funded and paid for by the same people and they promulgate the same view that we should be internationally governed.
[00:06:56.696 --> 00:06:59.317]  And so it leaves democracy completely behind.
[00:07:00.297 --> 00:07:09.222]  And let's be clear, you have a bureaucracy that sets the policies and then all the elected parliament that's represented by the different nations
[00:07:10.507 --> 00:07:17.571]  All you can do is basically amend or debate smaller sections.
[00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:26.475]  So literally, the once sovereign nations of Europe and England have been turned into vestigial ceremonial offices.
[00:07:27.636 --> 00:07:31.378]  This is quite true, and of course it's totally against our constitution.
[00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:35.420]  What a lot of Americans, and I visit America quite a lot and I love to do so,
[00:07:37.265 --> 00:07:41.346]  They don't fully understand that we do actually have a constitution in Britain.
[00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:51.288]  We do have something called the Bill of Rights, which was formulated in 1688, so it's several hundred years old.
[00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:53.428]  Yeah, you have the Parliament Act too, don't you?
[00:07:53.448 --> 00:07:54.948]  And then even before that, Magna Carta.
[00:07:55.268 --> 00:08:00.449]  We do, and if you go back to 1215, of course you go quite rightly, Alex, back to Magna Carta.
[00:08:00.929 --> 00:08:04.510]  So we've had a thousand years, nearly, of developing
[00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:09.550]  A parliamentary constitutional democracy under a constitutional monarchy.
[00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:19.472]  That, by the way, for those that don't know, was bought with a lot of blood and a lot of heroics that was then the model for our system here in the United States.
[00:08:19.752 --> 00:08:20.852]  Well, that's quite right.
[00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:32.775]  We fought to preserve a constitutional democratic monarchy in many, many wars and of course in the last century alongside the United States as our great ally.
[00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:43.131]  I'm a great believer in the transatlantic alliance between our two nations, because basically we think alike and we believe in the same things.
[00:08:43.567 --> 00:08:54.160]  But the problem with us is that we've discarded our Constitution and I noticed almost on a yearly basis the same thing is happening to America.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:03.731]  You've discarded your Constitution and we regard, certainly thinking people over here, regard the American Constitution as one of the greatest documents ever written.
[00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:06.225]  It's amazing.
[00:09:06.385 --> 00:09:11.472]  They're getting rid of due process, secret arrest is being implemented, warrantless spying.
[00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:16.017]  All the same systems we see in Europe, England, and are being implemented in the U.S.
[00:09:16.678 --> 00:09:19.582]  The bureaucracies even give the programs the same names.
[00:09:20.002 --> 00:09:22.705]  This is all being internationally organized and
[00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:37.020]  Five members of our Supreme Court have said in the last two years that they will follow UN courts above our courts when this is a despotism we have in Brussels, a despotism we have in Manhattan.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.360]  Now Obama...
[00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:39.721]  Stay with us.
[00:10:04.753 --> 00:10:06.835]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[00:10:06.855 --> 00:10:10.660]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.304]  Keep listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.

[00:10:18.648 --> 00:10:22.773]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco and experience
[00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:24.474]  It's true smoking freedom.
[00:10:24.734 --> 00:10:33.558]  PowerVapor.com is an e-cigarette with the look, feel and smoke of a real cigarette, but with no tar, no carbon monoxide and no bad odors.

[00:11:39.954 --> 00:11:41.375]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:11:41.715 --> 00:11:43.957]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:48.599]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.341]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.

[00:11:57.704 --> 00:11:59.806]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:12:04.775 --> 00:12:05.735]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:10.618]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:12:10.778 --> 00:12:18.581]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:12:18.841 --> 00:12:24.204]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:12:24.424 --> 00:12:31.387]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:12:31.687 --> 00:12:37.010]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:42.013]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:12:42.353 --> 00:12:49.978]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:12:50.298 --> 00:12:52.980]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.522]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:12:56.862 --> 00:13:00.383]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:00.704 --> 00:13:01.544]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[00:14:07.645 --> 00:14:17.570]  Godfrey Bloom, member of the European Union Parliament, with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:22.373]  Website's godfreybloommep.co.uk.
[00:14:32.483 --> 00:14:45.347]  Sir, it does seem though that as the European Union, unelected, tries to take power, tries to abuse people, more and more countries are voting to not expand their power, though they just keep coming back with referendums till they do.
[00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:50.488]  It looks like Greece and other countries may go bankrupt under the EU.
[00:14:50.508 --> 00:14:53.609]  I mean, there's more and more talk of the EU falling apart.
[00:14:53.789 --> 00:14:54.830]  A, is that accurate?
[00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.550]  B, should we hope for that?
[00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.751]  I mean, how do we combat these people?
[00:15:00.803 --> 00:15:07.329]  Well, we've got some of the problems we have is in the differences of law that we have in the United States and the United Kingdom.
[00:15:07.909 --> 00:15:10.692]  We have three main pillars of our legal system.
[00:15:11.132 --> 00:15:16.657]  That is the presumption of innocence, trial by jury and the concept of habeas corpus, i.e.
[00:15:16.677 --> 00:15:24.624]  the state can't lock somebody up without giving them a proper trial and a judicial system.
[00:15:25.188 --> 00:15:52.857]  Now, we've taken over, or the European Union has taken over something called the Napoleonic Code, which doesn't embody any of these things, and our Supreme Court, which was in fact the House of Lords, that was our final court of appeal legally, has been taken over by the European Court of Justice, which outranks that now, under a completely different system of law.
[00:15:53.602 --> 00:16:17.957]  They have a prescriptive system of law, and where these two things are extremely different, and this is something that your listeners need to understand because this is where it all begins, the system that we have in the United Kingdom, and largely the same in the United States of America, is that the legal system tells you that which you may not do.
[00:16:18.517 --> 00:16:21.879]  So there are a book of rules of things that you cannot do.
[00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:25.418]  Which we would all accept is fundamentally fair.
[00:16:25.838 --> 00:16:34.045]  Now the system of government that's come into Europe, and I think is coming into the United States, is a system which tells you that which you can do.
[00:16:34.485 --> 00:16:39.550]  A prescriptive legal system, which is extremely dangerous and extremely sinister.
[00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.673]  We do not want the government of the day to tell us what we can do.
[00:16:43.953 --> 00:16:45.695]  We just want a small book of rules.
[00:16:46.295 --> 00:16:47.096]  And if I may just
[00:16:47.781 --> 00:17:05.550]  Use a little analogy, which I often use here, which will help your listeners understand the point that I'm making, is that those of you with, those of your listeners with children, teenage children, probably say, as we do in England, look, there are half a dozen things you can't do in your room.
[00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:11.593]  You know, you can't smoke, you can't play loud music, no members opposite sex late at night, whatever.
[00:17:11.913 --> 00:17:14.294]  Probably half a dozen fairly sensible rules.
[00:17:14.707 --> 00:17:20.590]  But apart from that, the room belongs to, you know, the teenager and it's their space.
[00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.332]  And I think that's the way we've always wanted to work in our two countries.
[00:17:25.473 --> 00:17:34.738]  If you start telling them kids what they can do, you have a completely legalistic and prescriptive system, which nobody wants.
[00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:38.580]  And of course, that means you actually lose that concept of freedom.
[00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:39.720]  It's amazing.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.441]  But expanding on this, was it not a grievous blow?
[00:17:41.501 --> 00:17:43.322]  Was it a mortal blow to have their Copenhagen treaty
[00:18:04.059 --> 00:18:09.603]  Blow up in their face, or as Gordon Brown's saying, hey, we've always been an unelected bureaucracy.
[00:18:10.084 --> 00:18:27.377]  We'll just go ahead and write up the agreement, and we'll start monitoring countries, whether they like it or not, and we'll start taxing the England, the European Union, and the U.S., and we'll take that money and give it to these private banks to go out and buy off countries to go ahead and go along with it.
[00:18:27.417 --> 00:18:33.722]  I mean, they show what tyrants they are in that even though the Copenhagen thing fell apart,
[00:18:34.042 --> 00:18:35.603]  They're still going ahead with it!
[00:18:36.264 --> 00:18:44.189]  There's nothing that the modern political class seems to take notice of, of ordinary voters.
[00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:47.911]  They don't seem to care about what ordinary people think.
[00:18:47.951 --> 00:18:58.319]  Now, for example, my party, the United Kingdom Independence Party, at the last European election on June the 4th, came second over the whole country in the United Kingdom.
[00:18:58.379 --> 00:19:03.282]  And you know very well over there how difficult it is to start a new political party.
[00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:08.945]  It's almost impossible in a two-party system in the United Kingdom and the United States.
[00:19:09.318 --> 00:19:12.739]  But it gives you the depth of feeling there is amongst ordinary people.
[00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:15.200]  But still they ignore us.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:21.122]  And of course you know that the French voted against in their referendum only two years ago.
[00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:22.563]  The French voted no.
[00:19:22.623 --> 00:19:23.903]  The Dutch voted no.
[00:19:24.223 --> 00:19:30.486]  They won't give the British a referendum on the New Lisbon Treaty, which is the final treaty, which is a self-amending treaty.
[00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:34.927]  So the democracy has been completely removed.
[00:19:34.967 --> 00:19:36.828]  There is absolutely no democratic
[00:19:38.934 --> 00:19:39.954]  Sir, we've got a break.
[00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:42.695]  Long segment coming up.
[00:19:42.755 --> 00:19:48.317]  Continue along that thought line and how we beat these people on the other side.
[00:19:48.337 --> 00:19:53.578]  I mean, obviously we warn more people about the undemocratic nature of these people, but what else can we do?
[00:19:55.259 --> 00:19:56.159]  We're on the march.
[00:19:56.639 --> 00:19:58.260]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.861]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:08.758]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:13.140]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.822]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:20:19.162 --> 00:20:19.602]  It's true.
[00:20:19.902 --> 00:20:24.464]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:20:24.784 --> 00:20:25.325]  Number 3.
[00:20:25.605 --> 00:20:28.888]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:20:29.188 --> 00:20:32.931]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:20:33.112 --> 00:20:33.652]  Number 4.
[00:20:33.892 --> 00:20:36.274]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:20:36.655 --> 00:20:40.058]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:20:40.338 --> 00:20:40.558]  Number 5.
[00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:45.062]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:20:45.283 --> 00:20:50.047]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:20:50.327 --> 00:20:54.369]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:20:54.489 --> 00:20:56.070]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.371]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:20:58.531 --> 00:21:01.132]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:21:01.352 --> 00:21:07.575]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:21:07.995 --> 00:21:12.957]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:21:13.317 --> 00:21:15.058]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:19.940]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.180]  We're good.
[00:21:43.351 --> 00:21:44.332]  How much will you need?
[00:21:44.572 --> 00:21:45.193]  We don't know.
[00:21:45.473 --> 00:21:46.394]  How much do you want?
[00:21:46.595 --> 00:21:47.315]  All you can get.
[00:21:47.516 --> 00:21:48.377]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:48.617 --> 00:21:51.380]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.764]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:21:54.784 --> 00:21:55.564]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:22:03.996 --> 00:22:09.063]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:11.146]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:22:11.286 --> 00:22:13.569]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:22:13.729 --> 00:22:15.592]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:22:15.992 --> 00:22:17.354]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:22:17.614 --> 00:22:18.676]  There is a solution.
[00:22:18.916 --> 00:22:26.900]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:34.384]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:22:34.764 --> 00:22:40.427]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.
[00:22:40.807 --> 00:22:46.390]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.612]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:22:50.972 --> 00:22:58.136]  Go to E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com or give them a call right now at 866-762-9238.
[00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:01.758]  Click on their banner at Infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:23:15.987 --> 00:23:32.713]  Just a few days ago, Chris Matthews praised Saul Alinsky, the admitted hardcore communist, called a communist communist by the American Communist League and others, who called for putting Americans in re-education camps, who dedicated his book, Rules for Radicals, to Lucifer.
[00:23:33.094 --> 00:23:34.314]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:23:34.354 --> 00:23:36.155]  I mean, truth is so much stranger than fiction.
[00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:44.438]  Under national security, they declared Hillary's thesis, only the cover page was public,
[00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.935]  They declared national security on it.
[00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:56.923]  They've done the same thing with Obama's, but now Curt Nemo, webmaster for Infowars.com, just sent me this.
[00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:02.189]  And they've reportedly gotten more of the thesis.
[00:24:02.749 --> 00:24:03.851]  I was just given this during the break.
[00:24:03.871 --> 00:24:05.553]  Let's check and see how much of it's there.
[00:24:06.425 --> 00:24:08.547]  Because, I mean, part of it's always been public.
[00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:11.009]  Dude just walked in and said the thesis was just released.
[00:24:11.329 --> 00:24:12.691]  Let's check and see if this is the whole thing.
[00:24:12.711 --> 00:24:19.677]  I mean, we know the cover sheet praises, there is only the fight, an analysis of the Alinsky model.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:32.629]  A thesis for the scholarship requirement for a Bachelor of Arts degree under the Special Honors Program.
[00:24:33.868 --> 00:24:36.250]  Woolsey College, Wesley, Massachusetts.
[00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.351]  Hillary Rodham Clinton, political science.
[00:24:38.932 --> 00:24:39.532]  May 2nd, 1969.
[00:24:39.952 --> 00:24:42.674]  She probably wanted to get the paper in on May 1st.
[00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:43.835]  It was a bit late, though.
[00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:44.916]  Okay.
[00:24:45.396 --> 00:24:46.317]  Communist holiday.
[00:24:46.617 --> 00:24:47.778]  These people make me sick.
[00:24:48.018 --> 00:24:52.261]  But why do you see such big banks, big money for socialism and communism?
[00:24:52.561 --> 00:24:56.124]  Because they can pool the middle class's money, run our lives.
[00:24:56.965 --> 00:24:59.666]  The monopoly capitalists can shut down their competition.
[00:25:00.547 --> 00:25:05.140]  And then they can have a gaggle of armed thug communists running around enforcing it for him.
[00:25:05.541 --> 00:25:06.784]  Going to Economist?
[00:25:07.659 --> 00:25:16.704]  Military veteran, he's on the Economy and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Union Parliament and the Environmental Committee as well.
[00:25:17.064 --> 00:25:18.905]  Godfrey Bloom is our guest.
[00:25:18.945 --> 00:25:22.927]  Sir, dealing with the mindset, you've been in the Parliament, what, five years?
[00:25:23.407 --> 00:25:23.967]  I have indeed.
[00:25:24.748 --> 00:25:33.012]  And so you're around these globalists, you're around these, most of them lapdogs, most of them from Eastern Europe, who openly love tyranny.
[00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:36.354]  I'm not bashing Eastern Europeans, but most of these guys are former
[00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:40.218]  I guess apparatchiks is the word, or commissars.
[00:25:40.258 --> 00:25:41.319]  I've seen the list.
[00:25:41.379 --> 00:25:45.304]  Many of them were hardcore thugs for Khrushchev and people.
[00:25:45.324 --> 00:25:46.746]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:25:47.307 --> 00:25:48.929]  And so all of that's going on.
[00:25:49.289 --> 00:25:50.330]  What is their mindset?
[00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.452]  What makes them tick?
[00:25:54.426 --> 00:26:00.910]  How big a blow was this, what happened at Copenhagen, and what is the environmental movement really to these people?
[00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.671]  Because my research shows they're not useful idiots.
[00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:06.313]  They know it's a cold-blooded resource grab.
[00:26:06.533 --> 00:26:07.673]  They know it's a scam.
[00:26:08.034 --> 00:26:13.977]  I mean, we've got local commissars here in Austin I've talked to over dinner, and they say, Alex, join the team.
[00:26:14.017 --> 00:26:15.218]  We're robbing everyone.
[00:26:15.518 --> 00:26:17.199]  I mean, it's a big joke to them.
[00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:19.220]  Do you get the same thing out of these people?
[00:26:20.084 --> 00:26:21.524]  I don't in the Parliament, no.
[00:26:21.544 --> 00:26:24.705]  I'm dealing with people who are not as clever as that.
[00:26:25.105 --> 00:26:27.846]  I'm dealing with people who are fundamentally stupid.
[00:26:28.126 --> 00:26:32.327]  A lot of whom haven't had the benefit of what I would regard as a formal education.
[00:26:32.807 --> 00:26:41.769]  You heard in the speech that I made at the beginning, which I made to the Parliament, we're dealing with people who think that carbon dioxide is some sort of pollutant.
[00:26:42.737 --> 00:26:46.601]  I'm dealing with people who don't know the difference between carbon and carbon dioxide.
[00:26:46.881 --> 00:26:51.985]  I'm dealing with the difference between people who don't know the difference between carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide.
[00:26:52.446 --> 00:27:00.773]  I'm dealing with people who are almost incredibly stupid, and they are deliberately placed there by the main parties not to make a fuss.
[00:27:01.174 --> 00:27:08.160]  So when it comes to things like Copenhagen, you're actually dealing with members of my committee who actually believe this nonsense.
[00:27:08.553 --> 00:27:11.554]  And they believe this nonsense because they want to believe it.
[00:27:11.634 --> 00:27:21.375]  And of course, there's nobody so gullible as somebody who wants to believe something that they've been told because it actually now is a thread through every committee.
[00:27:21.395 --> 00:27:24.016]  It's this green thread that runs.
[00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:25.596]  It's a power grab.
[00:27:25.636 --> 00:27:37.698]  It means we can grab more power all the time from the people, undermine the democratic situation, because if we don't take away these powers that people have died for under a democratic society for years,
[00:27:38.055 --> 00:27:39.316]  That the world is going to end.
[00:27:39.476 --> 00:27:41.536]  It's a wonderful line, Alex, isn't it?
[00:27:41.877 --> 00:27:45.298]  We know that we're breaking with democratic tradition.
[00:27:45.558 --> 00:27:47.679]  We know we're doing things that people don't want.
[00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:51.541]  But if we don't do this, we're doing this to save themselves.
[00:27:51.881 --> 00:27:54.582]  We're doing this to save the people, to save the planet.
[00:27:54.902 --> 00:27:56.443]  It's a superb one-liner.
[00:27:56.743 --> 00:28:06.307]  And of course, in all the state schools in the United Kingdom, this is being pushed forward under the special system that they have now in English state schools.
[00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:11.595]  Where they are told, teachers are told what they can teach, how they can teach it.
[00:28:12.156 --> 00:28:15.178]  Most of the information in our country comes from television.
[00:28:15.558 --> 00:28:18.640]  Television, most television here is BBC.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:29.147]  All the senior appointments of the BBC, the Director General, the Governor, the presenters, are all employees of Number 10 Downing Street because that's how the system works.
[00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:35.631]  So there's this absolute relentless barrage of bogus junk science.
[00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:36.341]  I think.
[00:28:58.118 --> 00:29:13.949]  Absolutely, there is a lot of hope because this is undemocratic, it is tyrannical, and in history, if people just continue to tell the truth and continue to expose a fraud, it will implode.
[00:29:14.049 --> 00:29:15.269]  Here's the problem though.
[00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:25.916]  Even though they've been exposed as scam artists, as frauds, the establishment just continues on down the same path.
[00:29:27.658 --> 00:29:30.420]  And they're so over the top in their fraud.
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:40.465]  Three years ago, I interviewed David Rothschild, the heir to the largest Rothschild fortune, who was then billed as savior of the planet.
[00:29:40.865 --> 00:29:47.969]  Here he is on the cover of Outside Magazine, the hero gene, how to tap into yours.
[00:29:49.252 --> 00:29:52.776]  And it actually says in here that he's like Jesus Christ.
[00:29:52.836 --> 00:29:56.240]  I guess the Rothschilds have always thought they were the Merovingian line.
[00:29:56.721 --> 00:30:00.225]  And so it says he is a savior, he is a Christ.
[00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.068]  I mean, this is a new religion.
[00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:04.750]  Al Gore has said they're going into religion.
[00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.412]  The plastic Jesus.
[00:30:07.857 --> 00:30:17.639]  And then I have Al Gore here saying he is the, this is Newsweek, the eco-prophet, and it says he's the thinking man, thinking man saving us.
[00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:23.580]  When I had Rothschild on, he said, I said, why are the ice caps on Mars melting?
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.881]  They've since started getting larger again because the sun's cooled off.
[00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:30.301]  And he said, because Mars is closer to the sun than the Earth.
[00:30:31.482 --> 00:30:33.702]  And I said, no, Mars is the next planet out.
[00:30:35.373 --> 00:30:37.999]  And I said, why are the moons on Jupiter and Saturn melting?
[00:30:38.179 --> 00:30:40.164]  And he said, well they're closer to the Sun than the Earth.
[00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:41.607]  And I said, no they're not.
[00:30:43.221 --> 00:30:50.302]  And you know, he laughed at me, not because he didn't know, but he thought my audience was like the general public, so dumb.
[00:30:50.642 --> 00:30:52.563]  I mean, Al Gore didn't invent the internet.
[00:30:53.223 --> 00:30:54.663]  Polar Bears aren't drowning.
[00:30:55.163 --> 00:30:56.363]  Their numbers are way up.
[00:30:56.864 --> 00:31:00.244]  But they know carbon isn't carbon dioxide.
[00:31:00.564 --> 00:31:06.765]  They know all this, but they just, they're so over the top that they just keep getting away with it.
[00:31:07.025 --> 00:31:09.346]  How do you counter this level?
[00:31:10.206 --> 00:31:13.467]  Of just over-the-top, in-your-faceness?
[00:31:14.647 --> 00:31:25.770]  I think what we need to do, and we've started over here, we haven't got that far along the road yet, but my party, the United Kingdom Independence Party, was born out of ordinary people.
[00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:36.973]  The ordinary man, and we have an expression over here, the ordinary man on the Clapham Omnibus, it's just, you know, the ordinary, you call him, I think you call him an ordinary Joe, or you call him Joe Sixpack.
[00:31:38.083 --> 00:31:40.124]  These people, you've got to have faith in them.
[00:31:40.184 --> 00:31:44.205]  I don't think they're nearly as stupid as the Liberal middle-class elite think they are.
[00:31:44.605 --> 00:31:52.227]  They know they're being conned, they know they're being lied to, and they're voting for us now when we have a proportional representation system.
[00:31:52.467 --> 00:32:02.169]  When we get away from the two-party system which we have for our European elections, they feel that they can vote for us, and they do vote for us in their millions.
[00:32:03.062 --> 00:32:06.445]  And now what we need to do is, we're going to continue with this.
[00:32:06.505 --> 00:32:10.368]  We're putting 500 candidates up for the Westminster elections in May.
[00:32:10.649 --> 00:32:16.393]  That's virtually a complete ticket of UKIP people.
[00:32:17.054 --> 00:32:22.198]  So everybody in every constituency can say, just a minute, I have got an alternative.
[00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:25.201]  And I think the same thing needs to happen in America.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:32.765]  Because you do lead the world, you will always lead the world for the foreseeable future, and you can turn this round.
[00:32:33.105 --> 00:32:39.709]  And I think if people could look to America, the new world if you will, by doing something like this, I think it would be fabulous.
[00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:46.454]  And it's far be it for me to suggest what you should call that party, but I would call it the American Constitution Party.
[00:32:46.874 --> 00:32:53.859]  Because most of what's going on as I see it in America, and the same thing in the United Kingdom, is actually a breach of constitution.
[00:32:54.289 --> 00:33:12.724]  And if you could get back to your constitution, I mean just looking at the situation with Interpol, looking at climate, looking at even the new healthcare bill that's coming through Congress and the Senate that you're dealing with out there at the moment, that is completely alien to the American constitution.
[00:33:13.536 --> 00:33:19.144]  It says nowhere that I can see in the American Constitution that you are responsible for your neighbor's health bills.
[00:33:19.684 --> 00:33:27.455]  But even worse than that, even if you're for socialism, which is alien to our system, which creates dependency and corruption and waste,
[00:33:28.376 --> 00:33:48.561]  Obama is massively cutting Medicare and Medicaid while jacking up taxes and prison time if you don't get the insurance and if you tell your doctor you don't want a certain treatment the government throws you off the rolls and it does create government bureaucracies that decide what treatment you get.
[00:33:48.661 --> 00:33:50.022]  It does give you rationing.
[00:33:50.122 --> 00:33:50.902]  I'll never forget
[00:33:51.803 --> 00:34:09.648]  Three or four years ago, right before Gordon Brown got into power, I watched Tony Blair in the House of Commons hearing Prime Minister's questions on C-SPAN, and he admitted one person, one member of the Parliament got up and said, of the House of Commons, got up and said, well, my constituent had to wait 18 months for a brain tumor.
[00:34:11.308 --> 00:34:12.529]  Yes, we did what you're doing now.
[00:34:12.549 --> 00:34:13.469]  We did in 1946.
[00:34:40.805 --> 00:35:01.942]  1947.
[00:34:41.145 --> 00:35:01.942]  We got rid of a perfectly good health system which was based on individuals and individuals' relationships with their own doctors and their own local hospitals, which were built on some part charitable status, part fee-paid status, and they brought in this terrible monolith called the National Health System.
[00:35:02.341 --> 00:35:02.721]  I don't know.
[00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:26.035]  It's a sacred cow over here.
[00:35:26.315 --> 00:35:32.841]  Would you believe that now we have more administrators in the system than we have hospital beds?
[00:35:33.584 --> 00:35:38.026]  This is the sort of lunacy that you get, and I've been reading through the bill.
[00:35:38.046 --> 00:35:47.330]  I'm not an expert on it, but I would beg you and I beg all your listeners, for goodness sake, write to whoever does represent you and say, for God's sake, don't vote for this.
[00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:49.231]  This will be a disaster.
[00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:57.314]  I don't quite know how it happened, but you seem to have elected a socialist president, and I don't know how that happened.
[00:35:58.578 --> 00:35:59.819]  Well, look at the VA.
[00:35:59.959 --> 00:36:02.260]  I mean, hellish health care for our veterans.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.002]  More than half the money gets spent on administration, not on the health care.
[00:36:07.882 --> 00:36:13.184]  And reading this bill, it is just a giant boondoggle.
[00:36:13.204 --> 00:36:17.106]  It gives the insurance companies government immunity.
[00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:18.607]  It gives the hospitals immunity.
[00:36:19.047 --> 00:36:20.968]  And you talk about globalization.
[00:36:21.923 --> 00:36:22.724]  Global governance.
[00:36:23.105 --> 00:36:24.226]  All these things that are happening.
[00:36:24.607 --> 00:36:32.277]  They have to get rid of local control to the national level if the national is going to be handed over to the international.
[00:36:32.878 --> 00:36:36.763]  And we've interviewed Nigel Farage, former leader of your party, and others.
[00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:40.588]  We've interviewed Lord Monckton and others who talk about global governance.
[00:36:40.928 --> 00:36:46.475]  The new head of the European Union, as you know, Herman Van Rompuy, says this is the first year of global governance.
[00:36:46.835 --> 00:36:49.678]  They believe the Copenhagen Treaty was the first year of global governance.
[00:36:50.099 --> 00:36:53.503]  Can you speak to this pan-global Europe?
[00:36:53.923 --> 00:36:59.066]  That the EU talks about the European Union model taking over the planet through treaties.
[00:36:59.546 --> 00:37:08.351]  And I remind listeners, three years ago George Bush signed a transatlantic treaty with the SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership, with the European Union.
[00:37:08.631 --> 00:37:11.612]  So this integration is far along under stealth.
[00:37:11.652 --> 00:37:14.254]  Can you speak to their master plan?
[00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:16.180]  Yes, certainly.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:36.001]  All I can tell so far is that we're dealing with a sort of a European-Soviet system, and of course all we need to do then is if we then have a North American or an American system which is similar, and it's going that way, every day you get closer to that situation.
[00:37:36.377 --> 00:37:40.642]  It's only a matter of time before those two power blocks come together.
[00:37:40.923 --> 00:37:55.520]  The only thing at the moment that is stopping that going forward at an even faster rate is the fundamental hostility in the European bureaucracy and Parliament, a fundamental hostility to the United States.
[00:37:55.911 --> 00:38:00.553]  A fundamental hostility to the concept of free trade and capitalism.
[00:38:00.793 --> 00:38:02.654]  There's a fundamental hostility to this.
[00:38:02.914 --> 00:38:08.656]  So there's actually a sort of a theoretical problem that needs to be overcome.
[00:38:08.676 --> 00:38:19.560]  But as soon as that is overcome, you've got to understand that these, as I'm sure your listeners do, that senior politicians, they don't have anything to do with the NHS.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.940]  They go into private wards.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.361]  They're privately looked after.
[00:38:22.641 --> 00:38:25.082]  If they have a brain tumour, it's dealt with immediately.
[00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:33.190]  That senior politicians do not send their children to the same schools, they do not go to the same hospitals.
[00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:42.619]  Did you know, for example, I wonder if you did, that the bureaucracy in Brussels, all the civil servant bureaucracy which is enormous, don't pay tax.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.520]  Did you know that?
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.023]  They don't pay income tax, their salaries are free of tax.
[00:38:46.707 --> 00:38:54.169]  So consequently, the more they vote for centralism, statism, and high tax and high spending, they're actually out of the loop themselves.
[00:38:54.529 --> 00:38:56.250]  Now that's a key point you just made.
[00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:58.451]  That's a key point.
[00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:02.972]  Our own Congress here exempts themselves from most of their fines and fees.
[00:39:04.052 --> 00:39:09.694]  There's a law that they have to pay taxes, but 50 plus percent have been caught just not paying.
[00:39:10.254 --> 00:39:13.796]  Go back over that though, because I was not aware of that.
[00:39:15.396 --> 00:39:17.777]  I mean, I knew that that went on in a lot of communist countries.
[00:39:18.177 --> 00:39:20.637]  They are exempt from their own taxes.
[00:39:20.978 --> 00:39:30.640]  That is the greatest mark of tyranny, is when you, it's like Animal Farm, you know, four legs good, two legs better.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.941]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:39:33.361 --> 00:39:36.082]  Say that again, I'm doing a double-take here.
[00:39:36.302 --> 00:39:40.423]  There's something called a sort of, there's a notional sort of
[00:39:41.738 --> 00:39:54.660]  International tax, which is put on the bureaucrats, which is very, it's only marginal, it's something like 10%, whereas everybody else in Europe, including me, incidentally as an MEP, I pay British tax.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.621]  I pay about 45% of my income in tax.
[00:39:58.161 --> 00:40:08.523]  But the actual bureaucracy which makes the laws, so the people who actually make the law do not pay taxes as ordinary individuals.
[00:40:08.783 --> 00:40:10.343]  They pay very marginal tax.
[00:40:10.922 --> 00:40:14.585]  They also don't pay VAT, so they drive big Range Rovers.
[00:40:14.605 --> 00:40:18.889]  They buy a brand new Range Rover or Mercedes and BMW, and there's no VAT.
[00:40:18.909 --> 00:40:21.190]  Now, VAT on the continent, on the car, is 20%.
[00:40:21.691 --> 00:40:26.034]  So imagine an immediate 20% discount on your new car.
[00:40:26.935 --> 00:40:28.817]  It's just like the Soviet system.
[00:40:28.837 --> 00:40:30.378]  It's just like the Politburo.
[00:40:30.658 --> 00:40:31.319]  Unbelievable.
[00:40:31.379 --> 00:40:31.839]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.284]  Everybody's standing in sausage lines, but all the Communist officials have two or three villas and racehorses.
[00:40:37.784 --> 00:40:38.004]  So...
[00:40:39.045 --> 00:40:40.325]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[00:41:07.566 --> 00:41:08.968]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[00:41:09.409 --> 00:41:10.830]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[00:41:11.191 --> 00:41:14.755]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.

[00:42:05.944 --> 00:42:09.608]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:42:09.968 --> 00:42:13.010]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:42:13.231 --> 00:42:14.632]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:17.975]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:42:17.995 --> 00:42:24.220]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:42:24.381 --> 00:42:29.425]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:42:29.945 --> 00:42:39.573]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:42:39.693 --> 00:42:41.795]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:42:42.035 --> 00:42:43.356]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:42:43.616 --> 00:42:45.898]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.920]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.005]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:42:53.345 --> 00:42:58.129]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:44:20.083 --> 00:44:21.904]  By the way, this is giant news.
[00:44:22.444 --> 00:44:29.467]  Hillary Clinton's Saul Alinsky thesis, which has been classified, has been released in full.
[00:44:30.988 --> 00:44:32.949]  We were reading over this some during the break.
[00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:35.950]  It is absolute communism, how she's a communist.
[00:44:36.971 --> 00:44:37.991]  Oh, God help us.
[00:44:38.212 --> 00:44:45.055]  I mean, how did we ever let this... Folks, communists killed three, four, five times, depending on which numbers you look at, more than Hitler.
[00:44:45.075 --> 00:44:47.436]  I mean, there's nothing worse than communists.
[00:44:48.612 --> 00:44:50.494]  These are just dirty thieves.
[00:44:50.674 --> 00:44:52.076]  They don't care about the poor.
[00:44:52.716 --> 00:44:53.417]  And they know it.
[00:44:53.797 --> 00:44:59.984]  Look, I was having an incredible conversation, too, with a European Union member of Parliament, Godfrey Bloom.
[00:45:00.724 --> 00:45:03.667]  I didn't know that they were exempt from tax.
[00:45:03.728 --> 00:45:05.249]  During the break, I googled it.
[00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:06.550]  There was mainstream news.
[00:45:06.971 --> 00:45:10.715]  He told me that the European Union bureaucrats that
[00:45:12.051 --> 00:45:14.973]  Yeah, they don't pay any tax.
[00:45:15.394 --> 00:45:25.902]  They pay a standard basic rate of tax, which is something, a minimal amount, like 10%.
[00:45:25.962 --> 00:45:26.943]  It's a token amount.
[00:45:27.644 --> 00:45:32.808]  They don't pay any sales tax, as you call it over there, when they buy a new car, which is 20%.
[00:45:32.848 --> 00:45:36.831]  So their new Mercedes is 20% cheaper than anybody else's.
[00:45:37.641 --> 00:45:39.902]  So they're always voting for big government.
[00:45:39.942 --> 00:45:41.202]  They're voting for more tax.
[00:45:41.462 --> 00:45:42.963]  They're voting for more spending.
[00:45:43.263 --> 00:45:45.303]  And yet they don't contribute to any of this.
[00:45:46.524 --> 00:45:50.625]  Well, our founders went to war over taxation without representation.
[00:45:50.665 --> 00:45:52.305]  You already have that because they're unelected.
[00:45:52.505 --> 00:45:53.525]  But this is even worse.
[00:45:53.866 --> 00:45:57.487]  They are openly, do as I say, not as I do.
[00:45:57.547 --> 00:45:59.367]  I mean, that is tyranny.
[00:45:59.447 --> 00:46:02.328]  I mean, it doesn't get any more bonafide than that.
[00:46:03.616 --> 00:46:07.060]  It's interesting you made a point earlier, Alex, about the East Europeans.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:20.073]  You know, some of the East Europeans who weren't part of the Communist regime, the ordinary working people in places like Poland and the Czech Republic are suddenly beginning to realise what they've stepped into.
[00:46:20.094 --> 00:46:25.159]  And it was the Czech President, President Klaus, on his outgoing speech
[00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:28.370]  In the Parliament said, you know, I know all about this.
[00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:32.532]  I went to prison under the Soviet regime.
[00:46:32.552 --> 00:46:35.193]  And what we're seeing is a Soviet regime.
[00:46:35.513 --> 00:46:39.274]  The European Union is totally modelled on the Soviet system.
[00:46:40.194 --> 00:46:42.035]  It isn't modelled on the United States.
[00:46:42.335 --> 00:46:49.078]  People are being told in Western Europe that the European Union is basically, the basic pattern is the United States.
[00:46:49.178 --> 00:46:50.178]  It's nothing of the sort.
[00:46:50.458 --> 00:46:51.679]  It's the Soviet Union.
[00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:55.240]  And all these things I've been talking about today prove it, do they not?
[00:46:56.710 --> 00:47:02.491]  And for those that haven't studied this parliamentary set-up in the bureaucracy, it really is set-up like the Politburo.
[00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:05.572]  It really is set-up to do whatever it wants, whenever it wants.
[00:47:05.892 --> 00:47:07.152]  It really is dictatorial.
[00:47:07.253 --> 00:47:18.015]  And now, they're saying they have EU arrest warrants and Obama has amended the Interpol agreement to allow them to do basically whatever they want inside the United States.
[00:47:19.795 --> 00:47:21.836]  If the European arrest warrant
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:51.865]  Well, if somebody says, say in Austria for example, that they don't like gypsies, and that's considered to be xenophobia under the Austrian law, they can arrest you when you go home with a European arrest warrant, they don't need a magistrate's warrant, they don't need a prima facie case, there's no concept of habeas corpus, so they can arrest you, a foreigner can arrest you, he can take you to Austria, they can imprison you without charge for as long as they like.
[00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:52.642]  I'm good.
[00:48:07.375 --> 00:48:08.056]  We're good to go.
[00:48:32.864 --> 00:48:37.146]  Well, he's an economist, he's a member of the European Union Parliament, he's Godfrey Bloom.
[00:48:37.506 --> 00:48:39.567]  Look forward to speaking to you again in the future, sir.
[00:48:39.887 --> 00:48:41.268]  Keep up the fight against tyranny.
[00:48:41.588 --> 00:48:43.749]  Great pleasure.
[00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:49.532]  Thank you for listening to GCS.

[00:49:57.236 --> 00:49:59.136]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:49:59.617 --> 00:50:02.298]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:12.301 --> 00:50:23.427]  They tell you that there's no world government, as mainstream media announces every day that global government will save us, and that David Rothschild, heir to the Rothschild fortune, is Jesus.
[00:50:25.768 --> 00:50:30.451]  You cannot make this level of evil up.
[00:50:32.592 --> 00:50:38.275]  His prophet is Al Gore, the eco-prophet.
[00:50:42.489 --> 00:50:46.711]  Ladies and gentlemen, this has always been classified.
[00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:49.231]  I've scanned over it.
[00:50:49.392 --> 00:50:50.252]  It looks real.
[00:50:50.272 --> 00:50:54.813]  Tartan Emo's got it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:54.853 --> 00:50:57.214]  They'd always declared national security on this.
[00:50:59.355 --> 00:51:01.076]  How great Saul Alinsky is.
[00:51:01.096 --> 00:51:06.998]  We already had books like Tarpoli's book documenting that she had Alinsky
[00:51:08.459 --> 00:51:15.586]  Hillary brought Alinsky to the Wesley in January 69 to speak at a private dinner for a dozen students.
[00:51:16.287 --> 00:51:19.971]  And it goes on to how they expressed how much they loved communism together.
[00:51:21.773 --> 00:51:27.899]  And this is actually reading Hillary Clinton's hidden thesis, MSNBC, May 9th.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.043]  Alinsky offered Hillary a job as a community organizer.
[00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:39.409]  See when you hear community organizing, see this thing's been floating around because government worshippers of communism get to read it as their bible.
[00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:42.253]  And then they tell you, oh there's no communism!
[00:51:43.554 --> 00:51:45.357]  Oh yeah, the government take over a healthcare?
[00:51:45.897 --> 00:51:49.702]  Obama spending more than all presidents before him combined in less than a year?
[00:51:50.683 --> 00:51:51.705]  There's no communism?
[00:51:54.448 --> 00:51:56.529]  Well, there isn't communism in the way you were taught.
[00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:58.691]  Loving people that want to share.
[00:51:58.971 --> 00:52:03.273]  Yeah, and black uniforms want to rape your wife and daughters and put you in a slave camp.
[00:52:04.414 --> 00:52:05.115]  That's all they are.
[00:52:05.835 --> 00:52:06.676]  Slave camp runners.
[00:52:08.697 --> 00:52:10.538]  We got Tarpley coming on this week, by the way, already.
[00:52:10.558 --> 00:52:11.579]  What day is he set up for?
[00:52:12.679 --> 00:52:13.800]  Thursday, 1 o'clock.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.602]  Give us a year in the review, looking into trends next year.
[00:52:17.622 --> 00:52:19.463]  We got Salente tomorrow, right?
[00:52:19.483 --> 00:52:21.745]  Alright, here's the deal.
[00:52:22.265 --> 00:52:23.206]  I said I'd go to Kohl's.
[00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:29.986]  And we're going to go to... Oh, Stephen Australia hung up.
[00:52:30.006 --> 00:52:30.807]  I wanted to talk to him.
[00:52:31.627 --> 00:52:32.808]  First time callers, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:52:32.889 --> 00:52:37.653]  I'm going to take calls in the next segment.
[00:52:37.733 --> 00:52:41.176]  Then I'm going to play video clips and news blitz to the end of the show.
[00:52:41.657 --> 00:52:46.681]  Recap the underwear bomber and all of that.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.100]  The U.N.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:53.161]  being given expanded diplomatic immunity in the U.S.
[00:52:53.181 --> 00:52:55.242]  through their power arm, Interpol.
[00:52:57.763 --> 00:53:03.224]  So, that is coming up today after I take some of your phone calls.
[00:53:03.244 --> 00:53:06.205]  In fact, right now, let's go to Mike in New York.
[00:53:08.266 --> 00:53:09.086]  You're on the air, Mike.
[00:53:09.106 --> 00:53:09.466]  Go ahead.
[00:53:14.108 --> 00:53:14.768]  Yeah, go ahead, buddy.
[00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:20.315]  Okay, sir, I have a question for you on what you were talking about earlier.
[00:53:20.755 --> 00:53:26.219]  Now, obviously, in the movement in the United States, we obviously have the majority of the citizens.
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:31.564]  But as you mentioned earlier, the elite just keep doing whatever they want.
[00:53:32.144 --> 00:53:38.169]  And I know that there's a state while amassing physical implements of force against us.
[00:53:38.749 --> 00:53:39.050]  Yes.
[00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:40.291]  Go ahead.
[00:53:40.331 --> 00:53:41.452]  Right, right, right.
[00:53:41.552 --> 00:53:44.374]  So as far as the American people are concerned,
[00:53:45.696 --> 00:53:50.119]  We are at a point of a mass strike movement, and we have been that way.
[00:53:50.139 --> 00:53:52.241]  Yes, we are in a captured country.
[00:53:52.761 --> 00:53:54.743]  We are in an occupied nation, there's no doubt.
[00:53:55.964 --> 00:53:56.464]  Right, right.
[00:53:56.564 --> 00:54:06.733]  So, Mike, what I want you to talk about a little bit is, and this is the last thing I want you to do, was just to talk about the state movement and our progress on that as you see it, sir, and that's it.
[00:54:06.793 --> 00:54:07.133]  Thank you.
[00:54:07.573 --> 00:54:08.114]  God bless you.
[00:54:08.134 --> 00:54:09.135]  I appreciate the call, Mike.
[00:54:10.137 --> 00:54:17.580]  What's happening is the media, the ADL, the Republicans, are trying to demonize the state sovereignty movement.
[00:54:19.341 --> 00:54:22.562]  And they have Rick Perry come out and say, I want Republic of Texas!
[00:54:22.582 --> 00:54:23.723]  We're gonna secede!
[00:54:24.283 --> 00:54:26.744]  And later he says, oh I was just joking in a press release.
[00:54:27.648 --> 00:54:40.102]  So they're trying to make us look like we're revolutionaries that want to secede when we want the federal government that's been captured by offshore illegitimate interests to get off our backs and follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:54:40.976 --> 00:54:50.120]  So over 30 states are declaring sovereignty, declaring 10th Amendment and 9th Amendment powers, and that is one of our biggest aces in the holes.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:57.543]  The problem is, the bankers through the feds have already bankrupted most of the states to try to make them be dependent.
[00:54:58.203 --> 00:55:03.984]  We have to get to the state houses and get the word out and let them know they have the people's support resisting this.
[00:55:04.004 --> 00:55:08.385]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:12.766]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:55:13.046 --> 00:55:18.448]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:55:18.788 --> 00:55:19.248]  It's true.
[00:55:19.528 --> 00:55:24.089]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:55:24.389 --> 00:55:24.950]  Number 3.
[00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:28.513]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:55:28.813 --> 00:55:32.556]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:55:32.737 --> 00:55:33.277]  Number 4.
[00:55:33.517 --> 00:55:35.879]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:39.683]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:55:39.963 --> 00:55:40.504]  Number 5.
[00:55:40.764 --> 00:55:44.687]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:49.672]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:55:49.952 --> 00:55:53.976]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:55:54.116 --> 00:55:55.678]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:55:55.898 --> 00:55:57.980]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.503]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:56:05.831 --> 00:56:09.472]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:56:09.792 --> 00:56:17.933]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:56:18.653 --> 00:56:22.694]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:56:23.274 --> 00:56:34.096]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:56:34.736 --> 00:56:43.738]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:56:44.238 --> 00:56:49.299]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:56.861]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:59.902]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:57:05.074 --> 00:57:08.717]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:57:09.077 --> 00:57:12.100]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:17.124]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:57:17.144 --> 00:57:23.370]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:25.772]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:57:26.292 --> 00:57:26.592]  Tim Geithner?
[00:57:26.612 --> 00:57:27.013]  Bernanke?
[00:57:27.113 --> 00:57:27.473]  They're arsonists!
[00:57:27.493 --> 00:57:28.434]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:57:28.454 --> 00:57:30.575]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:57:45.205 --> 00:57:47.026]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:57:47.326 --> 00:57:52.167]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:57:52.487 --> 00:58:01.590]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:06.053 --> 00:58:12.080]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:58:12.681 --> 00:58:15.725]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:23.755]  Well, the health care bill is going to be
[00:58:24.977 --> 00:58:29.139]  Going into conference committee, set to be passed the next few weeks.
[00:58:30.219 --> 00:58:40.663]  Also, the federal government could run out of money by January 1st, Obama's saying, if Congress doesn't pass an increase of the debt ceiling by several trillion dollars.
[00:58:42.104 --> 00:58:42.464]  A year.
[00:58:43.344 --> 00:58:46.906]  The way the media spins it, it's what's just due that day, a few hundred billion.
[00:58:51.247 --> 00:58:52.408]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:58:53.442 --> 00:59:00.326]  And so they're going to threaten to shut the government down if the health care isn't rammed through.
[00:59:01.006 --> 00:59:03.287]  People better contact that conference committee.
[00:59:03.908 --> 00:59:06.009]  They better call the Democratic Party leadership.
[00:59:06.449 --> 00:59:08.670]  There are Democrats exiting the sinking ship.
[00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:17.115]  But the bigger issue is when Republicans get in in a year and take control of the House or they get control of the Senate in the next
[00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:29.514]  There's some evidence though that they're afraid of a real revolution, a peaceful revolution through the Republican Party and that's why they've put in the bill that another two-thirds majority
[00:59:48.894 --> 00:59:55.417]  Is needed in the House or a super majority, what, 60 plus percent in the Senate.
[00:59:57.418 --> 00:59:57.818]  60 or more.
[00:59:59.199 --> 01:00:00.920]  To be able to repeal any of this.
[01:00:04.682 --> 01:00:13.326]  So they are really trying to put the screws down and make more people dependent and take over more of health care.
[01:00:15.276 --> 01:00:28.263]  I wanted to play Congressman Bacchus here, drunkenly on the floor last week, chastising people on the other side of the aisle who need to get behind the government takeover of health care.
[01:00:28.303 --> 01:00:28.703]  Here it is.
[01:00:30.584 --> 01:00:44.331]  I asked, where's the senator on that side of the aisle who's got the courage to break from their leadership, break from the partisanship of the other side of the aisle, to work together to pass health care reform?
[01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:46.696]  I asked them, where's the courage?
[01:00:46.736 --> 01:00:54.578]  Where are the senators that have got the courage on that side of the aisle to stand up and work together on a bipartisan basis to get health care reform passed?
[01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:55.078]  Where?
[01:00:56.659 --> 01:01:01.340]  We on this side reached out our hands for bipartisan agreement on health care reform.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.260]  Probably to a fault.
[01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:05.021]  Probably to a fault.
[01:01:05.586 --> 01:01:17.653]  And I say fault because for months and months and months, this Senate anyway, Senator Grassley and I worked very hard to get Senators on both sides of the House to work to pass health care reform.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.761]  I don't think so.
[01:01:43.855 --> 01:01:46.978]  And those senators there in the room were acting in good faith.
[01:01:46.998 --> 01:01:48.659]  You're not watching PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:01:48.679 --> 01:01:50.500]  You can't see his body language.
[01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:52.122]  I mean, he is drunk.
[01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:53.203]  Very good questions.
[01:01:53.263 --> 01:01:54.924]  Senator Enzi, for example, from Wyoming.
[01:01:54.984 --> 01:01:56.445]  Very good questions.
[01:01:56.545 --> 01:01:59.528]  Senator Snow asked very good questions.
[01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:03.911]  Senator Grassley asked very good questions.
[01:02:03.931 --> 01:02:04.712]  But you know what happened?
[01:02:04.952 --> 01:02:05.952]  You know what happened, Mr. President?
[01:02:05.992 --> 01:02:06.693]  You know what happened?
[01:02:06.713 --> 01:02:07.233]  You know what happened?
[01:02:07.613 --> 01:02:09.954]  One by one by one, they started to drift away.
[01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.675]  They wanted to pass health care.
[01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:15.036]  They wanted to act on a bipartisan basis.
[01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:20.538]  But they were pressured, pressured, from their political party, not to do it.
[01:02:21.198 --> 01:02:21.839]  Not to do it.
[01:02:22.399 --> 01:02:23.019]  Not to do it.
[01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.220]  Why are they pressured not to do it?
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:25.660]  Not to do it.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:30.522]  Unfortunately, they gave in to their pressure because their leadership wanted a political statement.
[01:02:31.921 --> 01:02:32.821]  It's hard not to watch that.
[01:02:32.842 --> 01:02:39.024]  I mean, for people that aren't watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and are just listening to the radio, you gotta go up to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:39.044 --> 01:02:39.945]  We got the video linked.
[01:02:55.083 --> 01:02:57.744]  He is just completely drunk off of his gourd.
[01:02:57.764 --> 01:03:13.333]  I mean, you can hear it in the audio, but when you're watching the video, he's kind of stumbling around and... I mean, he definitely, probably has had at least 10 whiskeys there.
[01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:14.293]  He is from Montana.
[01:03:15.234 --> 01:03:19.696]  Montana has a lot of great people out there, but what are they doing having that communist as their senator?
[01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:21.117]  Get rid of him!
[01:03:23.198 --> 01:03:24.339]  I'm sick of these people!
[01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:27.899]  All right, let's talk to Rick in Texas.
[01:03:27.999 --> 01:03:28.659]  Rick, you're on the air.
[01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:29.100]  Go ahead.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:30.861]  Hello, Alex.
[01:03:30.901 --> 01:03:31.741]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:03:32.021 --> 01:03:32.401]  Hey, buddy.
[01:03:32.421 --> 01:03:37.304]  Hey, see, I just heard you talking to that last caller about physical implements of force.
[01:03:38.525 --> 01:03:49.971]  See, I had been trying to get through to you, and believe it or not, I had sent some emails to you, and I'm going to have to talk to somebody off the air, but I do have some information you may want to let everybody else or make everybody else aware of.
[01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:51.192]  Well, just tell us.
[01:03:51.232 --> 01:03:51.632]  What is it?
[01:03:53.641 --> 01:04:01.469]  A couple of months ago we were down on the border and we noticed a couple of buddies called me and they said that there were some helicopters at the International Airport.
[01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:08.136]  And we had Apache helicopters, RAF medevacs, and a couple of other helicopters.
[01:04:08.476 --> 01:04:14.722]  So you need to understand we can see the Mexican border from our front doorstep and we can see the International Airport.
[01:04:15.803 --> 01:04:16.444]  And we saw
[01:04:17.894 --> 01:04:24.218]  RAF helicopters, marine helicopters, and army helicopters openly and freely going into Mexico back and forth.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.562]  Yeah, you better believe that those are probably drug shipments.
[01:04:30.482 --> 01:04:34.345]  But, I mean, I have the FEMA press release NLE-09.
[01:04:34.365 --> 01:04:38.308]  I mean, I've seen scores of news articles over the years.
[01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:43.632]  We show a bunch of them in Road to Tyranny, my film, 2002.
[01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:51.629]  Where they have openly signed deals to use foreign troops in America.
[01:04:52.249 --> 01:04:56.373]  And now they're openly have the Marine Corps and Army running checkpoints all over the country.
[01:04:56.733 --> 01:05:00.416]  But they just do it incrementally to acclimate everyone.
[01:05:00.456 --> 01:05:01.436]  And well, see?
[01:05:01.537 --> 01:05:03.098]  So the Army's running checkpoints.
[01:05:03.618 --> 01:05:07.161]  So the Army was at the Kentucky Derby stopping drunks.
[01:05:08.382 --> 01:05:10.063]  Again, they're just conditioning everybody.
[01:05:10.343 --> 01:05:12.425]  What do you think the helicopters were doing down there?
[01:05:13.456 --> 01:05:17.439]  To be absolutely honest with you, none of us know, but I did approach the airport.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.082]  I did call a couple of people up there, and they said that they were training Cessnas.
[01:05:21.743 --> 01:05:28.989]  I did call a couple of news agencies in San Antonio, and they were stopped in Brackettville by military police and turned around.
[01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.891]  Hold on.
[01:05:32.391 --> 01:05:35.414]  San Antonio media was turned around where?
[01:05:37.371 --> 01:05:43.415]  As far as I heard from San Antonio media, they said they were turned around about 30 miles away in Brackettville by military police from Laughlin.
[01:05:44.616 --> 01:05:56.765]  Well, all I know is that the governor, six months ago, said no to Homeland Security, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, MPs.
[01:05:57.065 --> 01:05:58.386]  It was in the newspapers there.
[01:05:58.687 --> 01:06:00.128]  We wrote articles about it and linked to it.
[01:06:00.168 --> 01:06:02.770]  We had a state rep on for people who want to pull that up.
[01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:09.601]  And the governor said you can't do these illegal checkpoints and the military went ahead and did it!
[01:06:10.662 --> 01:06:11.823]  Went ahead and did it!
[01:06:12.723 --> 01:06:15.886]  And so, I mean, I believe almost anything anymore.
[01:06:16.186 --> 01:06:17.487]  Well, shoot some video of it.
[01:06:17.527 --> 01:06:18.467]  Get it up on YouTube.
[01:06:19.288 --> 01:06:29.735]  I've got video, I've got pictures, but know this, Alex, we've tried to send them through to your site several times, five to six different people, and we can't get it through.
[01:06:30.356 --> 01:06:32.657]  What I mean, there's a media blackout of 200 miles between
[01:06:34.085 --> 01:06:34.946]  Austin and the border.
[01:06:35.266 --> 01:06:36.447]  There's really a media blackout.
[01:06:36.487 --> 01:06:37.327]  We can't get to you.
[01:06:37.768 --> 01:06:40.870]  The first time I'm speaking to you now is probably because I'm about 50 miles away from you.
[01:06:42.451 --> 01:06:46.854]  Well, you think they've got some kind of computer system that tracks anybody locally from calling this show?
[01:06:47.535 --> 01:06:49.276]  Or blocks email in the area?
[01:06:49.596 --> 01:06:51.117]  Well, listen, I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:55.961]  I'm going to give you one of our internal emails and send it.
[01:06:57.362 --> 01:06:57.702]  Okay?
[01:06:57.762 --> 01:06:58.763]  Or I'll get your phone number.
[01:06:58.803 --> 01:06:59.323]  How's that sound?
[01:06:59.343 --> 01:07:00.064]  Because I want to see this.
[01:07:00.936 --> 01:07:02.217]  Yeah, you're going to want to talk to me.
[01:07:02.237 --> 01:07:08.060]  You know that I'm local law enforcement, but I won't say what branch, because I don't want them to, you know, zero in on me.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:08.521]  Oh, really?
[01:07:08.841 --> 01:07:09.381]  Oh, okay.
[01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:12.963]  So you're some type of peace officer down there?
[01:07:14.504 --> 01:07:15.545]  You're very close.
[01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:18.067]  You're very close.
[01:07:18.127 --> 01:07:21.829]  And we do have federal agents working with state agencies, and we also do have U.S.
[01:07:21.889 --> 01:07:25.171]  military within the United States Border Patrol working there as well.
[01:07:27.112 --> 01:07:29.814]  And so there's British aircraft down there?
[01:07:31.108 --> 01:07:32.170]  I think so.
[01:07:51.269 --> 01:07:53.431]  Well, I'll tell you, now that makes sense.
[01:07:53.471 --> 01:08:04.958]  If you are a police officer or a sheriff's deputy, now it makes sense that, of course, if they're running a security operation, they do have programs they can put in place to block certain emails with certain keywords.
[01:08:05.399 --> 01:08:07.160]  I have read about things like that going on.
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:11.343]  Wow, this must be a really important operation if they're doing stuff like that.
[01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:16.186]  So, well, I mean, I've got National Level Exercise 09 right here.
[01:08:18.883 --> 01:08:33.491]  And it openly states that all these troops from foreign countries and intelligence agencies training to deal with American terrorists but are the police in your area starting to wake up seeing these foreign assets?
[01:08:34.551 --> 01:08:45.557]  We are seeing it and there's plenty of us that have seen it and maybe you well I'll notify you that but as far as I know Texas peace officers right now are being mandated to go over a chemical biological and nuclear warfare
[01:08:46.013 --> 01:08:49.094]  And chemical, nuclear, and biological threats within the larger cities.
[01:08:50.194 --> 01:09:02.897]  Now, to be absolutely honest with you, I don't believe that a street cop is capable or has the capabilities to even be any help in a situation like that.
[01:09:03.437 --> 01:09:06.958]  I mean, a patrol officer... Well, that's just a test to test your federalization.
[01:09:07.318 --> 01:09:08.579]  That's a federal muster.
[01:09:08.599 --> 01:09:14.140]  I mean, all the big departments we've seen, under executive order, under FEMA funding,
[01:09:18.128 --> 01:09:25.753]  Yes, sir, absolutely.
[01:09:26.173 --> 01:09:33.618]  Like I said, when you see the information that I got and how difficult it was for us to get through to you, I'm going to be absolutely honest with you, Mr. Jones.
[01:09:33.658 --> 01:09:43.104]  We actually thought that you were sending, or your outfit was sending information to them because we've actually had federal agents come to us already and ask us to stop.
[01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:45.206]  And they did attack our Second Amendment also.
[01:09:46.556 --> 01:09:46.816]  What?
[01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:48.799]  Hold on, I gotta talk to you.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.501]  Hold on, I gotta talk to you during the break.
[01:09:50.521 --> 01:09:52.523]  This is getting crazier by the minute.
[01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:56.468]  Rick from, I guess, South Texas calling us.
[01:09:56.488 --> 01:10:01.414]  I'll tell you this, we're not in Kansas anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:01.915 --> 01:10:03.297]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:10:03.317 --> 01:10:03.958]  We'll be right back.
[01:10:05.458 --> 01:10:06.678]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:09.279]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[01:10:09.619 --> 01:10:12.640]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[01:10:13.161 --> 01:10:17.402]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[01:10:17.942 --> 01:10:23.104]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[01:10:23.704 --> 01:10:27.927]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[01:10:28.207 --> 01:10:34.231]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:35.892]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[01:10:36.292 --> 01:10:42.396]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[01:10:42.756 --> 01:10:44.397]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[01:10:44.777 --> 01:10:45.178]  I think?
[01:11:05.817 --> 01:11:09.460]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:12.842]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:14.504]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:11:15.217 --> 01:11:17.879]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:24.103]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:11:24.283 --> 01:11:29.307]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:39.454]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:11:39.574 --> 01:11:41.675]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:11:41.915 --> 01:11:43.255]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:11:43.495 --> 01:11:45.776]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:11:45.976 --> 01:11:47.797]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:11:47.817 --> 01:11:52.898]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:11:53.239 --> 01:12:02.342]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:04.582 --> 01:12:08.185]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:12:08.505 --> 01:12:12.068]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[01:12:12.308 --> 01:12:12.889]  Midas Resources.
[01:12:16.684 --> 01:12:17.644]  We're good to go.
[01:12:41.812 --> 01:12:42.933]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:12:43.154 --> 01:12:47.899]  Get the facts and call Midas Resources toll free at 888-292-2709.
[01:12:48.159 --> 01:12:51.983]  That's 888-292-2709.
[01:12:52.224 --> 01:12:57.590]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty silver half dollar.
[01:13:04.975 --> 01:13:06.617]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[01:13:06.737 --> 01:13:08.178]  Say no to toxic overload.
[01:13:08.238 --> 01:13:09.339]  Say no to chemicals.
[01:13:09.579 --> 01:13:11.381]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:20.249]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[01:13:20.309 --> 01:13:25.574]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.

[01:14:20.324 --> 01:14:24.310]  Fendi's playing Dixie, man got his head outstairs.
[01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:30.279]  Could be the viola, could be the local breeze.
[01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.990]  Okay, I'm going to get to your calls near the end of the show.
[01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:47.573]  I just ended up spending most of a segment with that one caller because it was such interesting information.
[01:14:47.953 --> 01:14:49.915]  He's trying to send us the photos right now.
[01:14:53.237 --> 01:15:08.446]  On the subject of Interpol, I have read the executive order and what this did was amend an executive order by Ronald Reagan that did not give immunity to Interpol and it gave full immunity to Interpol.
[01:15:10.751 --> 01:15:14.835]  Interpol, set up after World War II by the U.S.
[01:15:14.875 --> 01:15:18.078]  and England, involved in narcotics trafficking.
[01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:22.642]  Everywhere you go in England, they ask for your name and address and social security number.
[01:15:23.183 --> 01:15:25.245]  It's put in a database at all hotels.
[01:15:25.345 --> 01:15:26.506]  Everywhere you go, you're tracked.
[01:15:26.926 --> 01:15:29.068]  The Interpol system has now been adopted here.
[01:15:30.046 --> 01:15:46.321]  For at least 20 years, they've had police and military exchange programs where our police get sent over to foreign countries, their police get sent over here, and they're now setting up a system under the EU arrest warrant and other systems where they can come here and arrest U.S.
[01:15:46.382 --> 01:15:49.204]  citizens and take them to foreign countries to be tried.
[01:15:50.826 --> 01:15:54.990]  And you just heard a European Union Member of Parliament breaking this down in the last hour.
[01:15:56.909 --> 01:16:03.934]  Now there are a bunch of news stories on this, but the best thing to read is Threats Watch.
[01:16:04.535 --> 01:16:08.017]  That's a link at the end of the article from National Review.
[01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:14.262]  And there's another article here that's important to read.
[01:16:16.948 --> 01:16:19.930]  That is out of another publication.
[01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:24.972]  The New Media Journal.us, the fifth column.
[01:16:25.673 --> 01:16:40.140]  President Barack Obama has issued an amendment to Executive Order 12,425 designating the International Law Enforcement Agency, Interpol, as a public international organization, thus extending diplomatic immunity to the law enforcement group.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:42.301]  The amendment
[01:16:43.422 --> 01:16:43.482]  The
[01:17:01.734 --> 01:17:02.415]  22 U.S.C.
[01:17:02.615 --> 01:17:28.612]  288, and in order to extend the appropriate privileges, exemptions, and immunities to the International Criminal Police Operation Interpol, it is hereby ordered that Executive Order 12,425 of June 16, 1983, as amended, is further amended by deleting from the first sentence the words, except those provided by Section 2, 3, Section 4, 5, 6 of the Act.
[01:17:31.715 --> 01:17:37.341]  And those were the areas that Ronald Reagan signed.
[01:17:38.222 --> 01:17:41.446]  You can zoom in right here actually on the subsection of the executive order.
[01:17:43.989 --> 01:17:48.895]  Those are the areas saying they were still open to search and seizure and still had to show papers.
[01:17:52.352 --> 01:18:10.245]  The text of Section 2, which applies to Interpol states, C. Property and assets of international organizations, whether located and by whomsoever held, shall be immune from search unless such immunity be expressly waived and for confiscation.
[01:18:11.305 --> 01:18:19.311]  The archives of international organizations shall be inviolable or inviolate.
[01:18:21.041 --> 01:18:25.562]  Now, that means just like our rights were once inviolate, inalienable.
[01:18:26.582 --> 01:18:32.744]  Now, the arguments by the White House are, hey, the UN's already got immunity.
[01:18:33.024 --> 01:18:34.164]  Yeah, let's take it from there.
[01:18:34.424 --> 01:18:40.686]  It's kind of like they say, hey, we've been thumbprinting you to get a driver's license nationwide for the last 10 years at least.
[01:18:41.146 --> 01:18:44.086]  What's wrong with us making you thumbprint to buy and sell now?
[01:18:44.606 --> 01:18:46.707]  The government's already got your fingerprints.
[01:18:47.814 --> 01:18:53.758]  Or, the government already took your baby's blood at birth in the last 37 years if you were born in a hospital.
[01:18:54.238 --> 01:18:56.719]  What's wrong with them using it for medical experiments?
[01:18:59.521 --> 01:19:02.343]  Oh, well, here is thestatesman.com.
[01:19:02.903 --> 01:19:05.945]  Texas had destroyed baby blood taken without consent.
[01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:08.919]  Because of lawsuits.
[01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:12.420]  They tried to Buffalo these people, but they went ahead and sued.
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:13.560]  This is criminal.
[01:19:13.961 --> 01:19:18.122]  Texas happens to hold the DNA for the entire United States.
[01:19:18.422 --> 01:19:20.023]  But this is a UN operation.
[01:19:20.363 --> 01:19:22.044]  Told you about that 14 years ago.
[01:19:22.064 --> 01:19:23.404]  Give me a close shot of that.
[01:19:25.465 --> 01:19:27.926]  The point is, people are in denial out there.
[01:19:28.406 --> 01:19:29.867]  The denial has to end.
[01:19:32.548 --> 01:19:33.608]  This stuff is going on.
[01:19:34.628 --> 01:19:35.569]  I'm gonna finish up
[01:19:36.502 --> 01:19:38.403]  With Interpol, with the U.N.
[01:19:38.463 --> 01:19:39.903]  Who made these guys God?
[01:19:40.463 --> 01:19:42.064]  Who made them all above the law?
[01:19:44.784 --> 01:19:45.164]  Okay?
[01:19:45.945 --> 01:19:47.145]  Who made them king?
[01:19:48.245 --> 01:19:49.005]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:49.025 --> 01:19:49.486]  Stay with us.
[01:19:49.506 --> 01:19:51.006]  We're talking about sovereign immunity.
[01:19:54.767 --> 01:19:55.687]  We're on the march.
[01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:57.768]  The empire's on the run.
[01:19:58.688 --> 01:20:01.409]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:04.861 --> 01:20:07.463]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:20:07.863 --> 01:20:12.826]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:20:13.186 --> 01:20:14.927]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:20:15.247 --> 01:20:20.050]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:21.211]  How much do you want?
[01:20:21.431 --> 01:20:22.172]  When do you want it?
[01:20:22.552 --> 01:20:24.153]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:20:24.433 --> 01:20:25.254]  When will you need it?
[01:20:25.514 --> 01:20:27.575]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:20:27.715 --> 01:20:28.816]  Will there be any food?
[01:20:29.056 --> 01:20:30.357]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:20:30.657 --> 01:20:32.959]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:20:33.119 --> 01:20:35.642]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:20:35.842 --> 01:20:39.045]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:20:39.426 --> 01:20:42.929]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:20:43.249 --> 01:20:44.230]  How much will you need?
[01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:45.091]  We don't know.
[01:20:45.371 --> 01:20:46.292]  How much do you want?
[01:20:46.472 --> 01:20:47.213]  All you can get.
[01:20:47.413 --> 01:20:47.794]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:48.174 --> 01:20:48.554]  I think.
[01:21:03.903 --> 01:21:10.746]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.126]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:21:12.146 --> 01:21:12.846]  It's very real.

[01:22:03.658 --> 01:22:08.844]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:22:08.964 --> 01:22:13.349]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:22:13.509 --> 01:22:15.351]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:22:15.772 --> 01:22:17.133]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:22:17.394 --> 01:22:18.435]  There is a solution.
[01:22:18.655 --> 01:22:26.679]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:22:58.206 --> 01:23:01.532]  Click on their banner at InfoWars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:35.573]  I remember receiving video of Cooperative Nugget 94, 95, 96 of foreign troops training to take on American citizens.
[01:23:37.993 --> 01:23:39.754]  And this was on the video.
[01:23:40.814 --> 01:23:44.515]  And then I went to urban warfare drills all over the United States.
[01:23:45.555 --> 01:23:51.176]  I had listeners send me footage all over the country of foreign troops
[01:23:53.706 --> 01:23:55.668]  Running drills to take over U.S.
[01:23:55.708 --> 01:23:56.088]  cities.
[01:23:56.388 --> 01:23:59.511]  And they would admit it was for the United States.
[01:23:59.551 --> 01:24:04.094]  They would do mock interrogations of, where did you get the weapon?
[01:24:04.114 --> 01:24:05.175]  Where did you get the helmet?
[01:24:05.215 --> 01:24:06.016]  Where are you from?
[01:24:06.156 --> 01:24:07.537]  I'm from San Francisco.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:15.763]  And I shot video of this and put it in Police State 2000.
[01:24:18.846 --> 01:24:30.097]  And people thought I hired the Coronado troop ship, and they thought I hired Hovercraft, and they thought that I had some $50 million budget, and it was fake.
[01:24:30.477 --> 01:24:35.001]  Because in 1999, people knew foreign troops in America was tyranny.
[01:24:37.183 --> 01:24:44.290]  Just like back in the 90s, we'd show a government document where they planned to condition the public, to get the public ready for implantable microchips,
[01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:46.176]  And then?
[01:25:12.413 --> 01:25:22.695]  In 2000, 2001, I would see Washington Post articles and Toronto Star articles, and I put them in Police State 2, the takeover, and Police State 3, total enslavement, and 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[01:25:22.995 --> 01:25:29.876]  I mean, we have the actual Washington Post and actual Toronto Star headlines saying, U.S.
[01:25:29.936 --> 01:25:32.697]  signs deal with Mexico and Canada to fight terror.
[01:25:33.517 --> 01:25:34.717]  Our armies are training.
[01:25:35.757 --> 01:25:38.758]  Then two years ago, members of the U.S.
[01:25:38.878 --> 01:25:39.218]  Senate
[01:25:40.231 --> 01:25:47.853]  Anne House actually wrote letters to Bush asking, what's going on with the SPP?
[01:25:48.313 --> 01:25:55.954]  Deals have been signed between the Mexican and Canadian military to be involved domestically on US soil and we weren't involved in Congress?
[01:25:59.715 --> 01:26:03.576]  Remember the Mexican troops and Dutch troops being brought in for Katrina?
[01:26:03.596 --> 01:26:06.817]  In fact, people don't believe that.
[01:26:06.877 --> 01:26:08.497]  Google Mexican troops, Katrina.
[01:26:10.776 --> 01:26:11.576]  In fact, YouTube it.
[01:26:12.096 --> 01:26:13.597]  We'll show people a YouTube video.
[01:26:14.437 --> 01:26:19.119]  For the first time since 1868, Mexican troops enter the U.S.
[01:26:19.279 --> 01:26:20.779]  Giant Mexican flags flying.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.340]  It's all about setting the precedent.
[01:26:26.201 --> 01:26:35.364]  Then you learn that the biggest Army, Navy, Marine Corps recruiting centers are in Manila, Philippines, Mexico City, Mexico, areas of Ukraine.
[01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:39.606]  Oh, Mexican troops aid Katrina efforts.
[01:26:39.646 --> 01:26:40.226]  Fox News.
[01:26:41.325 --> 01:26:42.206]  Laredo, Texas.
[01:26:43.007 --> 01:26:48.772]  A Mexican convoy began crossing in the United States on Thursday to bring aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina.
[01:26:51.034 --> 01:26:51.594]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:26:51.614 --> 01:26:52.475]  I knew it was a 6.
[01:26:52.515 --> 01:26:52.475]  1846.
[01:26:52.535 --> 01:26:53.336]  I said 1868.
[01:26:53.376 --> 01:26:54.036]  Or 18-something.
[01:26:54.117 --> 01:26:54.817]  The point is 1846.
[01:27:00.993 --> 01:27:06.296]  It's the convoy bound for San Antonio as the first Mexican military unit to operate on U.S.
[01:27:06.336 --> 01:27:07.276]  soil since 1846.
[01:27:08.237 --> 01:27:12.579]  See, this is all being done to acclimate you where it sounds reasonable.
[01:27:12.659 --> 01:27:26.886]  Remember, I got interviews with Army officers, Marine Corps officers, one is in road to tyranny, about how they were doing secret gun confiscation operations in Norfolk, Virginia and other places in the late 1980s.
[01:27:32.242 --> 01:27:59.902]  Now for PR purposes, you hear, oh, in Texas, and in California, and in Arizona, and in New York State, and in Florida, the National Guard, the regular Army, the Marine Corps, are going to be helping at football games, and the Kentucky Derby, and the NFL, Super Bowl, and to stop drunk drivers, and with the Jaws of Life, Army Times reported.
[01:28:03.122 --> 01:28:11.890]  Oh, well, of course the Army's here and suddenly there's Army ads everywhere and ads everywhere thanking the troops as they cut their health care benefits.
[01:28:12.651 --> 01:28:15.974]  It's all, do what the military says or you're not pro-America.
[01:28:16.334 --> 01:28:18.036]  The military now will run your life.
[01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:20.858]  And that's so the military hears it and gets acclimated.
[01:28:21.199 --> 01:28:23.040]  It's so the population gets acclimated.
[01:28:23.401 --> 01:28:25.743]  We are being conditioned to accept this.
[01:28:28.886 --> 01:28:29.026]  Now,
[01:28:36.903 --> 01:28:40.026]  Let me just go over a few articles I've seen in the last week on this.
[01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:46.833]  It's bad enough to have foreign troops in all these countless drills.
[01:28:46.873 --> 01:28:47.974]  What, earlier this year?
[01:28:48.395 --> 01:28:49.136]  Troops from...
[01:28:50.911 --> 01:28:54.313]  Eleven Latin American countries landed in Florida.
[01:28:54.974 --> 01:28:57.215]  Type, Latin American troops landed in Florida.
[01:28:57.515 --> 01:28:58.556]  I want people to see that.
[01:28:58.876 --> 01:28:59.697]  There's video of that.
[01:29:00.037 --> 01:29:01.838]  Latin American troops landed in Florida.
[01:29:02.418 --> 01:29:04.099]  And they practiced storming the beaches.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.701]  And again, all of this is acclimation.
[01:29:07.001 --> 01:29:08.182]  But that's not my opinion.
[01:29:11.576 --> 01:29:16.438]  In the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, read it for yourself.
[01:29:16.878 --> 01:29:25.703]  In the Presidential Decision Directive 51, that Obama's continued, it states that the executive branch is supreme dictator over the entire government.
[01:29:26.843 --> 01:29:31.205]  Congress is even allowed to see the full copy of it under National Security, even the Homeland Security Committee.
[01:29:35.967 --> 01:29:37.468]  In there, it states it all.
[01:29:40.925 --> 01:29:46.367]  And it states that Homeland Security and NORTHCOM will use U.S.
[01:29:46.467 --> 01:29:51.348]  military to engage domestic threats and to police the United States.
[01:29:51.728 --> 01:29:55.249]  And the RAND Corporation came out two weeks ago.
[01:29:55.429 --> 01:29:56.549]  In fact, that's out in my stack.
[01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:58.790]  Somebody go grab me that RAND Corporation report.
[01:29:59.230 --> 01:30:01.171]  It's 200 pages, roughly.
[01:30:01.391 --> 01:30:02.551]  It's out there in the stack on the table.
[01:30:03.411 --> 01:30:04.392]  I'll just show that to you.
[01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:05.652]  And it says,
[01:30:07.443 --> 01:30:24.914]  How the Pentagon is already setting up and running, and they propose it go fully operational, total federalization of all local police, where the military supports them and they support the military, and domestic centers set up with a new Pentagon-run National Police Force.
[01:30:28.837 --> 01:30:31.238]  And again, this is all rolled out slowly.
[01:30:31.999 --> 01:30:33.460]  It's all rolled out incrementally.
[01:30:39.915 --> 01:30:48.042]  Now this is a National Review article, and when you read the Threat Watch, that has the real breakdown.
[01:30:48.082 --> 01:30:52.766]  Really a scholarly report where it says Steve Shepard has more at Threat Watch.
[01:30:54.028 --> 01:30:56.510]  Why does Interpol need immunity from American law?
[01:30:58.812 --> 01:31:00.013]  Written by Andy McCarthy.
[01:31:04.997 --> 01:31:07.938]  You just can't make up how bizarre this crowd is.
[01:31:08.098 --> 01:31:16.001]  One week ago, President Obama quietly signed an executive order that makes international police force immune from the restraints of American law.
[01:31:16.142 --> 01:31:20.463]  Interpol is the shorthand for the International Criminal Police Organization.
[01:31:21.944 --> 01:31:24.945]  It was established in 23, but really got powerful after World War II.
[01:31:25.505 --> 01:31:27.246]  It operates in 188 countries.
[01:31:28.527 --> 01:31:29.387]  It's the real mafia.
[01:31:31.806 --> 01:31:46.934]  By Executive Order 12,425, issued in 1983, President Reagan recognized Interpol's international organization and gave it some of the privileges and immunities customarily extended to foreign diplomats.
[01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:59.040]  Interpol, however, is also an active law enforcement agency, so critical privileges and immunities set forth in Section 2C of the International Organizations Immunities Act were withheld.
[01:32:00.609 --> 01:32:01.690]  That's the section we read earlier.
[01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:07.072]  Specifically, Interpol's property and assets remain subject to search and seizure.
[01:32:07.332 --> 01:32:09.614]  They don't have diplomatic immunity.
[01:32:10.134 --> 01:32:27.683]  And its archived records remain subject to public scrutiny under provisions like the Freedom of Information Act, being constrained by the Fourth Amendment, the FOIA, and other limitations of the Constitution and federal law that protect the liberty and privacy of Americans in what
[01:32:28.983 --> 01:32:44.232]  Well, you little globalist over at the CIA-founded National Review should have thought about that before you helped sell America out, huh?
[01:32:46.113 --> 01:32:52.057]  On Wednesday, however, for no apparent reason, President Obama issued an executive order removing the Reagan limitations.
[01:32:52.157 --> 01:32:57.400]  This is Interpol's property, and assets are no longer subject to search and confiscation.
[01:32:58.243 --> 01:33:02.028]  And it's archives are now considered inviolable.
[01:33:02.970 --> 01:33:03.671]  Inviolable.
[01:33:03.691 --> 01:33:10.180]  I'm having trouble pronouncing that word, but that means basically the right of kings.
[01:33:13.138 --> 01:33:15.701]  Give me the definition of inviolable.
[01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:19.444]  I-N-V-I-O-L-I-A-B-L-E.
[01:33:19.464 --> 01:33:28.693]  I mean, I know it means that they're sovereign, standing apart, cannot be violated, cannot have liens placed on it, cannot be abridged, but I want to check that.
[01:33:29.453 --> 01:33:32.416]  So, I-N-V-I-O-L-A-B-L-E.
[01:33:32.436 --> 01:33:33.798]  And that's what the executive order says.
[01:33:34.753 --> 01:33:36.515]  The International Police Force, whose U.S.
[01:33:36.535 --> 01:33:40.479]  headquarters is the Justice Department in Washington, will be unrestrained by U.S.
[01:33:40.519 --> 01:33:47.205]  Constitution and American law while it operates in the United States and affects both Americans and American interests outside the United States.
[01:33:47.265 --> 01:33:48.186]  And that's the key.
[01:33:48.827 --> 01:33:55.113]  This is not just about foreign troops, foreign police getting to come over here, this is about
[01:33:56.174 --> 01:34:08.627]  Our FBI, our federal police, our federal marshals, fully operating under UN authority, international authority, and having immunity that's been extended to this guild.
[01:34:12.151 --> 01:34:13.813]  This inviolable...
[01:34:16.007 --> 01:34:23.870]  Interpol works closely with international tribunals such as the International Criminal Court, which the United States has refused to join because of its sovereignty surrendering provisions.
[01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:28.232]  And remember what the Supreme Court has said, five of the nine members have said recently.
[01:34:28.793 --> 01:34:31.874]  They've said, we will follow the orders of the UN.
[01:34:36.716 --> 01:34:39.937]  Listen to this, Marines and multinational forces train in Florida.
[01:34:42.358 --> 01:34:43.519]  Go ahead and play a clip of that.
[01:34:44.633 --> 01:34:46.133]  Go ahead and play the intro clip of that.
[01:34:48.054 --> 01:34:49.434]  Put that video up on screen.
[01:34:49.794 --> 01:34:59.457]  I'm going back to the previous document I asked for before I asked for Supreme Court justices' articles were there in the USA Today and other places telling you that the U.N.'
[01:34:59.437 --> 01:34:59.877]  's the boss.
[01:35:00.157 --> 01:35:00.617]  Here it is.
[01:35:00.677 --> 01:35:00.977]  Play it.
[01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:10.154]  It's a great opportunity to always observe the Navy Marine Corps team do something together that no one else can do.
[01:35:10.614 --> 01:35:14.818]  It's really important this year because for the first time in 50 years, the U.S.
[01:35:14.858 --> 01:35:22.864]  Navy Marine Corps team is being joined by the Inventaria d'Ebrie from many countries throughout the Latin America.
[01:35:23.424 --> 01:35:25.366]  So, it's a really historic event for us.
[01:35:25.506 --> 01:35:27.688]  I think, personally, I think it's been a long time coming.
[01:35:27.868 --> 01:35:36.174]  It's important because it demonstrates the importance of the relationships between our countries and how important it is for us to continue to work together.
[01:35:36.194 --> 01:35:39.237]  At the previous demonstration, basically, we had Marine Corps.
[01:35:39.697 --> 01:35:44.180]  Okay, and then it cuts to tourists on the Florida beach with troops walking around with machine guns.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:44.680]  Now, again...
[01:35:58.804 --> 01:36:00.405]  Let me pull this up for people who are in denial.
[01:36:00.445 --> 01:36:01.866]  People really hate this one.
[01:36:01.886 --> 01:36:04.667]  Those in denial really don't know what to do about this one.
[01:36:04.707 --> 01:36:06.328]  I document everything live on the fly here.
[01:36:06.968 --> 01:36:09.169]  And the guys get a lot of credit for being able to pull this up so quick.
[01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:12.811]  Supreme Court Justice says U.N.
[01:36:12.871 --> 01:36:13.972]  law trumps U.S.
[01:36:14.032 --> 01:36:14.272]  law.
[01:36:14.732 --> 01:36:15.732]  That should pull it up for you.
[01:36:17.513 --> 01:36:18.954]  You'll get five of the nine saying it.
[01:36:19.094 --> 01:36:20.355]  They're all meant to come out and say it.
[01:36:22.372 --> 01:36:23.253]  Why does the U.N.
[01:36:23.293 --> 01:36:30.258]  have all this immunity set up by the Rockefellers in 1945 in Presidio, San Francisco and Manhattan, New York, New York?
[01:36:31.983 --> 01:36:32.303]  Why?
[01:36:32.824 --> 01:36:41.671]  Why do we constantly have UN bureaucrats, every week I see it in the news, all over the world, caught running white slavery, caught running drugs?
[01:36:42.151 --> 01:36:43.853]  No one can look in their suitcases.
[01:36:43.873 --> 01:36:48.857]  I mean, if a UN bureaucrat lands with 20 cases, no one can search it.
[01:36:49.097 --> 01:36:59.005]  This is the international crime syndicate of the globalists giving themselves the authorization to engage in white slavery, money laundering, drug shipments,
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:00.620]  The U.N.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:10.583]  gets caught under diplomatic immunity with their private contractors like DynCorp and Halliburton on record loading up jets full of little kids and women they've kidnapped?
[01:37:11.083 --> 01:37:12.403]  The giant sex trade?
[01:37:12.463 --> 01:37:13.464]  This is on record!
[01:37:15.664 --> 01:37:16.445]  Could U.N.
[01:37:16.525 --> 01:37:17.205]  trump U.S.
[01:37:17.245 --> 01:37:18.045]  Constitution?
[01:37:18.065 --> 01:37:20.826]  I don't know if that's the right article.
[01:37:22.846 --> 01:37:25.487]  Try USA Today behind it, because I remember that headline.
[01:37:27.548 --> 01:37:28.688]  All right, continuing here.
[01:37:31.249 --> 01:37:41.296]  Interpol works closely with international tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court, which the United States has refused to join because of sovereignty-surrendering provisions, though top Obama officials want to use it.
[01:37:41.616 --> 01:37:50.402]  It also works closely with foreign courts and law enforcement authorities, such as those in Europe, that are investigating former Bush administration officials for war crimes.
[01:37:50.442 --> 01:37:56.126]  So they're coming at this of, oh, we don't want that, and then that sells the left on being for it.
[01:37:56.567 --> 01:37:59.469]  Don't worry, Obama's already said he's not going to investigate Bush.
[01:38:00.814 --> 01:38:02.095]  You know, if one U.N.
[01:38:02.135 --> 01:38:03.755]  member votes for it, that means nothing.
[01:38:04.355 --> 01:38:05.916]  Don't worry, the crimes will go unpunished.
[01:38:06.916 --> 01:38:09.578]  But you can't have a kangaroo court try Bush for crimes.
[01:38:09.638 --> 01:38:10.438]  It's got to be a U.S.
[01:38:10.478 --> 01:38:10.698]  court.
[01:38:11.838 --> 01:38:14.780]  Why would we elevate an international police force above American law?
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:22.883]  Why would we give immunity to an international police force from the limitations that constrain the FBI and other American law enforcement agencies?
[01:38:24.127 --> 01:38:37.237]  Why is it suddenly necessary to have, within the Justice Department, a repository for stashing government files, which therefore will be beyond the ability of Congress, American law enforcement, and the media, and the American people to scrutinize?
[01:38:38.598 --> 01:38:39.498]  Now that's a good article.
[01:38:41.159 --> 01:38:44.402]  Now, here's another one out of the Jerusalem Post.
[01:38:44.602 --> 01:38:51.367]  We're running out of time here, but Jerusalem Post, December 21st, IDF-US National Guard to share defense ideas.
[01:38:53.226 --> 01:39:09.935]  And you read the article, and it openly says in the article that, oh, the IDF has liaison officers in all the major branches of the military, but now they're going to have one in the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[01:39:11.127 --> 01:39:18.736]  And they're going to have one in the Homeland Security, and they're going to deploy to any operations inside the United States.
[01:39:19.337 --> 01:39:27.126]  He will go to training exercises, conferences, and if needed, will deploy with the National Guard to emergency situations, the officer explained.
[01:39:27.146 --> 01:39:29.349]  In fact, can I have a document, Cam, shot?
[01:39:29.929 --> 01:39:31.091]  People will deny this is in here.
[01:39:32.365 --> 01:39:38.608]  I've found more hit pieces today on us where they just say Interpol's not taking over and that none of this is true.
[01:39:38.828 --> 01:39:42.329]  And then I'm making it all up, thinking you're stupid and won't look into this.
[01:39:43.529 --> 01:39:46.851]  And of course it always comes from quote sources we can trust.
[01:39:47.811 --> 01:39:48.131]  Yeah.
[01:39:50.812 --> 01:39:54.754]  People from our supposed own camp trying to make you live in denial out there about what's happening.
[01:39:57.654 --> 01:40:03.155]  Israel's own Home Front Command National Guard will be bolstered during the operations.
[01:40:03.675 --> 01:40:05.236]  See, they call it Home Front Command.
[01:40:05.276 --> 01:40:06.516]  Here it's Homeland Security.
[01:40:07.896 --> 01:40:08.836]  And it goes on.
[01:40:09.096 --> 01:40:09.716]  So there you go.
[01:40:10.277 --> 01:40:10.617]  Here it is.
[01:40:10.737 --> 01:40:17.358]  Now, again, every time I mention this, I get emails going, well, yeah, the Explorer Scouts do work with police.
[01:40:17.398 --> 01:40:18.278]  What's wrong with that?
[01:40:19.558 --> 01:40:21.419]  Well, I happen to have the New York Times.
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:35.164]  And countless other newspaper articles where Secure Corps, Division of AmeriCorps, and other groups are doing paramilitary training for the last 10 years with the federal government to quote, take on disgruntled veterans.
[01:40:36.525 --> 01:40:37.885]  And here is the daily news.
[01:40:37.945 --> 01:40:39.506]  It was also in the Contra Costa Times.
[01:40:40.086 --> 01:40:47.989]  LAPD on course to take over Explorer program completely from the Boy Scouts.
[01:40:48.009 --> 01:40:50.670]  3,000 young people have already gone through the LAPD program.
[01:40:51.778 --> 01:40:53.861]  Training them to be law enforcement.
[01:40:54.082 --> 01:40:59.590]  And then you go find out what this training entails and it's taken on American gun owners.
[01:41:01.673 --> 01:41:03.555]  That's in this New York Times article.
[01:41:06.272 --> 01:41:07.453]  Remain in your houses.
[01:41:08.294 --> 01:41:13.458]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:41:14.059 --> 01:41:15.240]  Will they do it?
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:17.382]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:41:18.042 --> 01:41:24.047]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:41:24.508 --> 01:41:25.749]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:30.192]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:41:30.973 --> 01:41:35.257]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:41:35.837 --> 01:41:40.121]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:45.585]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:41:46.486 --> 01:41:54.628]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:41:54.908 --> 01:41:57.189]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:41:57.409 --> 01:42:00.309]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[01:42:00.469 --> 01:42:03.410]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[01:42:05.811 --> 01:42:09.452]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:42:09.832 --> 01:42:12.853]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:42:13.073 --> 01:42:14.493]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:42:15.214 --> 01:42:17.875]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:42:17.895 --> 01:42:24.077]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:42:24.257 --> 01:42:29.299]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:42:29.459 --> 01:42:39.442]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:42:39.562 --> 01:42:41.663]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:42:41.903 --> 01:42:43.244]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:42:43.484 --> 01:42:45.766]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:42:45.946 --> 01:42:47.787]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:42:48.067 --> 01:42:52.830]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:57.993]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:43:04.384 --> 01:43:07.566]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:43:07.906 --> 01:43:09.648]  Now, going green can save money.
[01:43:09.928 --> 01:43:15.271]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:43:15.471 --> 01:43:23.217]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[01:43:55.317 --> 01:43:56.578]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[01:44:09.165 --> 01:44:14.388]  Yeah, we got the definition for inviolable and it was exactly what I thought it was.
[01:44:14.908 --> 01:44:17.589]  Middle English from the Middle French or Latin.
[01:44:19.871 --> 01:44:20.731]  15th century.
[01:44:21.391 --> 01:44:26.774]  It means secure from violation or profanation.
[01:44:27.114 --> 01:44:29.415]  That means the tax man sucking off you.
[01:44:29.916 --> 01:44:31.737]  Secure from assault or trespass.
[01:44:32.617 --> 01:44:36.639]  See, you don't own your property if you pay property taxes.
[01:44:36.679 --> 01:44:37.860]  You are an indentured serf.
[01:44:39.414 --> 01:44:41.837]  This country is no longer free, a long time ago.
[01:44:42.177 --> 01:44:43.438]  Property rights is the base.
[01:44:45.781 --> 01:44:49.925]  We now are chattel property of the bankers, through fraud.
[01:44:50.406 --> 01:44:56.893]  Any moment we could wake up and say no, but they're using the pretext of terrorism to set up the police state and control our lives.
[01:44:58.054 --> 01:44:59.276]  But I want you to understand this.
[01:45:01.001 --> 01:45:04.828]  They are training your children to spy on you in the public schools publicly.
[01:45:05.369 --> 01:45:10.319]  They are training your kids to come home and boss you around and write up reports on your environmental activities.
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:11.641]  They are training
[01:45:12.935 --> 01:45:15.317]  And again, it's in the New York Times saying how great it is.
[01:45:15.377 --> 01:45:19.161]  Scouts trained to fight terrorists and more disgruntled vets.
[01:45:19.702 --> 01:45:25.487]  And that's photos of the kids going in and doing drills of killing gun owners that won't turn their guns in.
[01:45:25.988 --> 01:45:27.309]  You cannot make this up.
[01:45:27.369 --> 01:45:36.919]  And now, they're just completely taking it away from the Boy Scouts and making it local big city police programs, which are then federally controlled.
[01:45:39.087 --> 01:45:42.109]  In fact, here it is, LAPD on course to take over Explorer Program.
[01:45:42.489 --> 01:45:43.749]  This is going on nationwide.
[01:45:43.789 --> 01:45:50.793]  Again, eight, nine years ago, I saw Secure Corps under the Philadelphia Police Control, under a federal grant.
[01:45:52.014 --> 01:45:52.414]  It's over!
[01:45:53.902 --> 01:45:54.803]  The country's gone.
[01:45:55.043 --> 01:45:58.225]  There's no chance in saving any of it unless we get honest about it.
[01:45:58.705 --> 01:46:00.387]  Now, as U.S.
[01:46:00.487 --> 01:46:12.655]  citizens, as sovereigns, as constitutionalists, as citizens of our states that constitute the federal government, and it's three just powers, we are sovereign.
[01:46:13.076 --> 01:46:14.276]  We are above the government.
[01:46:14.677 --> 01:46:18.840]  Unless we violate someone's rights, their property,
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.802]  Or hurt someone, unlawfully.
[01:46:22.402 --> 01:46:30.849]  Then a jury of our peers, of other sovereigns, convene, the grand jury, to decide whether you should be indicted.
[01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:39.736]  They then give that order to the judge, to the sheriff, to the bailiff, to the constables, to seize you.
[01:46:42.338 --> 01:46:43.760]  And then you're given due process.
[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:45.121]  That's being erased.
[01:46:46.642 --> 01:46:48.523]  Citizens don't even really get that anymore.
[01:46:49.183 --> 01:46:50.583]  Instead, the U.N.
[01:46:50.603 --> 01:46:53.684]  is only 60-something years old.
[01:46:53.744 --> 01:46:54.825]  What, 1945?
[01:46:55.425 --> 01:46:59.626]  It sets itself up, private banking front, and says, we're above the law.
[01:46:59.986 --> 01:47:01.107]  No one can arrest us.
[01:47:01.227 --> 01:47:02.127]  No one can stop us.
[01:47:02.367 --> 01:47:04.788]  That's why Maurice Strong can commit all these big crimes.
[01:47:05.288 --> 01:47:06.268]  Steal hundreds of millions.
[01:47:06.769 --> 01:47:07.269]  Do nothing.
[01:47:08.269 --> 01:47:09.689]  Diplomatic immunity.
[01:47:12.850 --> 01:47:13.871]  So, they
[01:47:14.997 --> 01:47:20.021]  Go far above the immunity we had from tyranny under the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:47:23.244 --> 01:47:25.766]  Your private property never had to pay taxes on it.
[01:47:26.066 --> 01:47:27.488]  Couldn't be taken by the government.
[01:47:28.228 --> 01:47:31.951]  Not even the king, under English common law, could take your home.
[01:47:32.592 --> 01:47:37.396]  Now, you don't pay the taxes, even though there's no way to pay them, they take your property.
[01:47:37.876 --> 01:47:39.398]  You have no sovereignty.
[01:47:39.658 --> 01:47:43.201]  They have godlike, Caesar, Caligula sovereignty.
[01:47:44.568 --> 01:48:00.096]  Whenever a king, whether it was in Babylon, or Egypt, or Greece, or Rome, or England, declared they were God and were above everyone, they would be overthrown as a tyrannous, as a tyrant.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:14.926]  Now, the UN and anyone they designate, and see, your government then designates, our government says, oh, you have immunity, but our own government's a member of it, so they get immunity.
[01:48:15.246 --> 01:48:21.110]  The government is above the law, foreign troops being brought in, brainwashing our kids, turning them against us.
[01:48:23.291 --> 01:48:28.994]  But then we have no sovereignty and no protections, the Patriot Act erases it all.
[01:48:30.250 --> 01:48:32.591]  This is a criminal, rogue government.
[01:48:33.191 --> 01:48:35.752]  It's all exposed in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:48:36.032 --> 01:48:36.972]  Great job, crew.
[01:48:37.252 --> 01:48:44.074]  I break down what really happened with this panties bomber coming up.
[01:48:45.974 --> 01:48:47.835]  You are listening to GCN.
