[00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:15.575]  I couldn't believe it last night when I got a call from Reuters demanding that I prove that that open letter to the President
[00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:39.056]  Written in the form of an interview script, was written by Charlie Sheen.
[00:00:39.056 --> 00:00:41.717]  And I said, why don't you call his publicist?
[00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:43.818]  Well, they did.
[00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:44.718]  And it's in U.S.
[00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:47.419]  News & World Report, the L.A.
[00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:58.202]  Times, the Houston Chronicle, and everywhere else, basically, that yes, Charlie Sheen wrote this open letter to the President.
[00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:02.883]  Now we're going to air an ever-before-heard interview with Charlie today on the show.
[00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:23.672]  It's roughly 21 minutes long, taped it with him in his house a few weeks ago, concerning why he wrote the letter to the President, why he wrote it in the form of an open letter to the President, and then tomorrow, on the same issue but a little bit different, a video call to action by Charlie Sheen.
[00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:28.995]  And when I made that video Monday for YouTube about the big announcement, I explained Monday is just the start.
[00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:35.367]  But so many people went and saw that open letter to the President and thought that was the whole issue.
[00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:38.268]  And some thought it was great, some thought it wasn't that good.
[00:01:38.268 --> 00:01:44.251]  A lot of people thought it was brilliantly written, but said you should have had the disclaimer at the top, and you're probably right.
[00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:47.773]  And I'm going to talk about some of that coming up later in the hour.
[00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.674]  Also, in fact, I forgot to do this.
[00:01:49.674 --> 00:01:50.394]  Call Kurt Nemo.
[00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:55.419]  Because Aaron works the night shift, he's not here.
[00:01:55.419 --> 00:02:01.103]  And Kirk can explain to people how about two out of eight articles don't post the whole thing and then he has to go repost it.
[00:02:01.103 --> 00:02:04.146]  I don't know why WordPress works this way.
[00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:07.548]  Anybody else who knows about it understands it.
[00:02:07.548 --> 00:02:12.372]  I can barely send an email, much less, but I've heard about the problems.
[00:02:12.372 --> 00:02:16.656]  Especially when you have a lot of embedded images, it'll cut things off or won't upload everything.
[00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.700]  It'll put weird symbols in the text.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.301]  I don't understand it.
[00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:27.482]  But it cut off the disclaimer for almost an hour.
[00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:29.943]  People are saying 90 minutes, that's not right.
[00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:32.763]  And I called up Aaron and Paul and I said, what in the world?
[00:02:32.763 --> 00:02:39.005]  I said, number one, it's an older version of this article.
[00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:44.427]  And I said, number two, because Charlie's written several versions, he kept honing it.
[00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:47.868]  And so I said, and there's none of the hyperlinks in it.
[00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:52.588]  And then I scrolled down and I went, oh my God, he doesn't even have the disclaimer here.
[00:02:52.588 --> 00:02:57.231]  So yes, there were like three different versions they fought to try to upload.
[00:02:57.231 --> 00:02:59.432]  And each time they were trying to, I don't know how to explain it.
[00:02:59.432 --> 00:03:01.993]  It's like when we, see, this is the mistake I made.
[00:03:01.993 --> 00:03:09.938]  I announced that we'd have something big happening on Tuesday, on Friday and Sunday and on Monday at eight o'clock in the morning.
[00:03:09.938 --> 00:03:15.301]  And I should have not done that because I forget our servers go down every time something big happens.
[00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:18.363]  Every time Drudge Report links to us, we go down and this is a lot bigger than that.
[00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.075]  And I got great IT guys.
[00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:23.077]  It's not their fault.
[00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:25.201]  That's why Drudge and other big sites are text only.
[00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:28.788]  When you have photos and videos and stuff, it just becomes a whole other... and comments.
[00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:39.669]  We need to create a really first rate black and white text only site but by first rate has all the new info being posted constantly and links to other sites because we're getting so big.
[00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.332]  Well I told you yesterday we went down off and on for an hour from like 9 to 10 just completely down.
[00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:49.235]  We couldn't just not get into the servers but thank God they got the disclaimer up before it completely went down.
[00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:52.957]  And the site InfoWars was completely down, Prison Planet was up and down and I look
[00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:56.202]  I don't have the money to hire extra IT guys.
[00:03:56.202 --> 00:04:01.746]  These guys are working sometimes 10, 12, 13, 14 hours a day, and I continually don't complain.
[00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:10.372]  I try to explain to people, you know, why people say, well, why, you know, why is this article scrambled or why is this, this article dead?
[00:04:10.372 --> 00:04:11.933]  And people think it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:13.234]  It's not.
[00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:16.136]  I've been told we could use something called Joomla or something called Drupal.
[00:04:17.264 --> 00:04:21.548]  And then we have discussions with other IT people, but look, I don't want to spend all day on this as a distraction.
[00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:30.055]  9-11, 8-year anniversary of the staged terror attacks is coming up.
[00:04:30.055 --> 00:04:34.419]  And we need to talk about that, so I've got a lot of folks coming up on the show today.
[00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:43.967]  Luke Radowsky, We Are Change, Richard Gage, Professor Stephen Jones, all coming up today, and the Virgin
[00:04:45.302 --> 00:04:50.650]  Maiden airing of this Charlie Sheen interview, then Charlie Sheen's coming up live.
[00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.995]  In fact, coming up live today, not just Friday.
[00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:55.057]  That's right.
[00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:56.159]  Two doses.
[00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.501]  Charlie Sheen here today.
[00:04:57.501 --> 00:04:57.961]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.882 --> 00:05:03.886]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:09.233]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.276]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:15.862]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:16.322]  We're good to go.
[00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:40.492]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:41.393]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.393 --> 00:05:42.493]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.493 --> 00:05:43.413]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.413 --> 00:05:44.513]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.513 --> 00:05:47.574]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.574 --> 00:05:48.094]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:48.094 --> 00:05:50.695]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:50.695 --> 00:05:51.535]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:51.855]  178.
[00:05:51.855 --> 00:05:55.096]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:05:55.096 --> 00:05:55.577]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:10.127]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:10.127 --> 00:06:17.176]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:25.688]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:26.055 --> 00:06:33.157]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:33.157 --> 00:06:36.337]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.337 --> 00:06:42.099]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.180]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.541]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[00:06:54.787 --> 00:06:55.128]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:04.923]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:07.505]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:08.365]  He was devastated.
[00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:17.170]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:23.374]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:26.075]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:07:26.075 --> 00:07:28.456]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[00:07:29.597 --> 00:07:29.917]  I think so.
[00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:55.604]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:55.604 --> 00:07:57.065]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.521]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:24.363]  It is 9-9-0-9 today.
[00:08:24.363 --> 00:08:40.495]  666, if you flip it, the Occultists, who are obsessed with numerology, no doubt are going to be playing some kind of horrid games out there today.
[00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:43.657]  Coming up at high noon, or in 52 minutes,
[00:08:46.906 --> 00:08:51.788]  We're going to air the interview I did with Charlie Sheen a few weeks ago at his home, Never Before Heard.
[00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:55.009]  You've heard the first minute and a half of it, but we're going to air the rest of it.
[00:08:55.009 --> 00:09:02.632]  Charlie's going to be popping in briefly live just to discuss some of the things that are coming up later in the week.
[00:09:02.632 --> 00:09:08.814]  Again, his 20 Minutes with the President article was meant to get attention to the 20 bullet points.
[00:09:09.713 --> 00:09:13.294]  Are they irrefutable evidence of 9-11 being an inside job?
[00:09:13.294 --> 00:09:21.016]  And on top of that, to energize a national debate and to make sure that that gets on President Obama's desk.
[00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:24.416]  And he's now formally asking for an interview with Obama.
[00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:34.359]  And again, I explained to listeners that the beginning was going to be Tuesday with what went up at 8 a.m.
[00:09:34.359 --> 00:09:37.059]  And it's certainly been successful.
[00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:38.800]  I will tell you that he's been
[00:09:40.802 --> 00:09:46.624]  In contact with, and he could have done it this week, but he has his TV show that he rehearses for Thursdays and he does Fridays.
[00:09:46.624 --> 00:09:49.865]  It's when they shoot two and a half men.
[00:09:49.865 --> 00:09:54.447]  Early next week, Charlie's going to be doing national television.
[00:09:54.447 --> 00:09:59.008]  He is seeking national television and he's getting it.
[00:09:59.008 --> 00:10:03.410]  And there's some other behind the scenes stuff going on, pressure on him and things.
[00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.410]  He just has a lot of courage.
[00:10:06.175 --> 00:10:08.397]  Don't forget what happened to Mark Cuban.
[00:10:08.397 --> 00:10:10.780]  The White House sent him an email and called him.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.542]  We told you about this the year before it was in the news.
[00:10:13.542 --> 00:10:18.427]  And said, uh, we're going to indict you for something made up if you don't shut up.
[00:10:18.427 --> 00:10:22.251]  And if you don't not make this 9-11 film or not distribute it.
[00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:24.053]  Loose change, final cut.
[00:10:24.053 --> 00:10:26.355]  People didn't believe us when we said Mark Cuban got threatened.
[00:10:26.355 --> 00:10:28.818]  We weren't going to tell details because he asked people not to.
[00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:35.359]  And then after they falsely indicted him and things for insider trading.
[00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:41.521]  I mean, imagine the White House and the SEC are calling you and sending you emails saying, we're going to get you, you 9-11 truther bastard.
[00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:47.544]  And Cuban's like, hey, I don't even necessarily really believe this, but I believe we need to have an open debate and be able to ask questions in America.
[00:10:47.544 --> 00:10:52.245]  And he puts out a lot of controversial stuff from different perspectives.
[00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:54.706]  But he said, okay, whoa, your White House is threatening me.
[00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:55.527]  Okay, I won't do it.
[00:10:55.527 --> 00:10:57.147]  And they said, you know what?
[00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:58.408]  We're still going to come after you.
[00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:04.663]  So I want people to realize that you're going to find out who's COINTELPRO in all of this and the alternative media.
[00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:10.484]  The people that distort and lie and attack us or use any mistakes we make to blow them out of proportion because they don't like this.
[00:11:10.484 --> 00:11:11.525]  But I'm a big boy.
[00:11:11.525 --> 00:11:12.945]  I love it.
[00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:14.485]  I love it.
[00:11:14.485 --> 00:11:15.646]  I love being attacked.
[00:11:15.646 --> 00:11:16.566]  I love being in the arena.
[00:11:23.362 --> 00:11:29.166]  And through all of this stressful stuff though, I just want to thank my crew because I know sometimes they don't love all the stress of it.
[00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:38.954]  Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Tim Frugier back there, Paul Hartman, Jaron Neihardt,
[00:11:40.091 --> 00:11:45.093]  Matt, some of the other IT guys, they just all bust their butts.
[00:11:45.093 --> 00:11:53.395]  Rob Dew, Jason Burmiss, Mike, back there we have several Mike's back there in the back, but I need to go ask employees if they ever want their names on here.
[00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:56.416]  I know a lot of them don't.
[00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:59.917]  I want to be careful about not giving out last names of folks who would rather not have that.
[00:12:04.735 --> 00:12:08.777]  You know, there's so much more about 20 Minutes with the President that you don't know as well.
[00:12:08.777 --> 00:12:11.137]  There's going to be some things we're going to announce Friday.
[00:12:11.137 --> 00:12:13.338]  That's what I tried to explain to people.
[00:12:13.338 --> 00:12:16.259]  And I told people this was going to be big, and it is big.
[00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:21.482]  We're basically running a PSYOP on the New World Order.
[00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:25.843]  And I've gotten a lot of phone calls.
[00:12:25.843 --> 00:12:26.964]  In fact, I got to listen to it.
[00:12:26.964 --> 00:12:32.366]  I talked to George this morning, but I had to get off the phone because it was right before the show, when George got up and I talked to him.
[00:12:34.935 --> 00:12:45.985]  I talked to him and he at first last night wasn't even sure that Charlie Sheen had even written this because he had all these trolls sending him thousands of emails making a big deal out of it.
[00:12:45.985 --> 00:12:49.347]  But I'll be on his show tonight to discuss it and talk about it.
[00:12:49.347 --> 00:12:56.614]  But I don't want the fact that 20 minutes with the President, Charlie Sheen's letter
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.301]  Had the disclaimer at the bottom.
[00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:05.682]  And for an hour or so, no disclaimer at all because we were having website problems and it wasn't loading the whole page.
[00:13:05.682 --> 00:13:08.403]  And we couldn't get access to our servers, the remote servers.
[00:13:08.403 --> 00:13:11.803]  Boy, my IT people explained it to me.
[00:13:11.803 --> 00:13:15.584]  I don't want to make it about that.
[00:13:15.584 --> 00:13:21.986]  I don't want to make it... We want to make it about the 20 points in the 20 minutes with the President.
[00:13:21.986 --> 00:13:24.206]  And we want to make it about Charlie going public.
[00:13:24.206 --> 00:13:26.007]  The big event is him asking
[00:13:27.148 --> 00:13:40.259]  President Obama to sit down with him and asking the American people to stand up and other movie stars to stand up and other people to step across that line and say we're not going along with this hoax.
[00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:41.940]  That's what this is all about.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.983]  This is about a counter-strike against the New World Order.
[00:13:44.983 --> 00:13:45.924]  And how do you break through?
[00:13:45.924 --> 00:13:47.265]  How do you get into the media?
[00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:50.988]  You do something novel.
[00:13:50.988 --> 00:13:53.070]  And Gawker Magazine and a bunch of others
[00:13:54.471 --> 00:14:11.541]  They seem to understand it and they have some Hollywood term for it where you put it into the context of a fantasy interview so that you can have theater of the mind and have people really interface with it and that was Charlie's intention with his idea.
[00:14:11.541 --> 00:14:12.542]  That was my intention.
[00:14:19.378 --> 00:14:31.227]  And we need to have 9-11 truth, and we are change, and activist groups, go to all of the Tea Parties, and the Ron Paul events, and to all the public events.
[00:14:31.227 --> 00:14:32.267]  It's your rights as U.S.
[00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:47.979]  citizens, and to the Democratic events, all events, and peacefully hand out Terror Storms, and Endgames, and Truth Risings, and Loose Change Final Edition, free to make copies, and 20 Minutes with the President, and go to these town halls and say, six of the ten 9-11 Commission members
[00:14:49.978 --> 00:14:55.483]  Six of the ten 9-11 Commission members say it's a fraud and a lie.
[00:14:55.483 --> 00:15:11.897]  Charlie wrote this letter to get that out there and he's made this video that we air tomorrow and he's done all of this and the taped interviews and the live interviews he's doing in an attempt to get a national debate going about these issues.
[00:15:11.897 --> 00:15:15.160]  He's literally throwing himself in front of the bus to do this.
[00:15:16.547 --> 00:15:18.528]  This isn't fun for him.
[00:15:18.528 --> 00:15:29.834]  He was very, even though it's his idea, and he wanted my help doing it, he was very, very nervous, and so was I, pulling the trigger on this, because these are very serious people that carried out 9-11, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:31.975]  This isn't a game.
[00:15:31.975 --> 00:15:33.596]  And you live, you learn with this.
[00:15:33.596 --> 00:15:42.180]  If I had it over to do, I would have launched it with no announcement, so, a lot of times, a lot of you that are big readers of InfoWars and Prison Planet see the bugs, see the problems, see the stories cut in half.
[00:15:43.496 --> 00:15:47.718]  And for anybody that's worked with WordPress or remote servers, when you have big sites, you pretty much have to do that.
[00:15:47.718 --> 00:15:50.520]  We're trying to get FiberOptics in right now to put our own servers in here.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.022]  We can't get the bandwidth out of here to put servers in here right now.
[00:15:54.022 --> 00:15:57.364]  We have some in-house little servers for email and stuff, but that's it.
[00:15:57.364 --> 00:16:04.888]  So we're fighting to try to upgrade things, and in that, I'm sorry, and we did screw up.
[00:16:04.888 --> 00:16:06.589]  And I apologize to everybody if
[00:16:08.223 --> 00:16:11.085]  You know, that you emailed it out for that first hour or so.
[00:16:11.085 --> 00:16:11.686]  No more than an hour.
[00:16:11.686 --> 00:16:12.547]  People are saying 90 minutes.
[00:16:12.547 --> 00:16:13.507]  That's incorrect.
[00:16:13.507 --> 00:16:17.331]  It was like 8 o'clock when it went up and I was looking and we noticed it 20-30 minutes in.
[00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:19.472]  At the time I didn't realize what a serious issue it was.
[00:16:19.472 --> 00:16:23.095]  And I called up saying, hey, fix it, upload it.
[00:16:23.095 --> 00:16:28.860]  And both the web guys are like, we're trying and we keep telling you that a third of the time we can't get in the servers.
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.901]  Tell the IT guys.
[00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:31.122]  And I'm like, okay, okay, okay.
[00:16:34.434 --> 00:16:40.278]  And that's why a lot of times you see Kurt's stories, he doesn't put articles or photos or things up in it, because that tends to... Look, I don't know.
[00:16:40.278 --> 00:16:42.099]  Maybe we don't have WordPress set right.
[00:16:42.099 --> 00:16:44.400]  Maybe some guru can tell us.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.063]  InfoWars and Prison Planet are better than they were two years ago before we went to WordPress.
[00:16:49.056 --> 00:16:50.797]  Again, I don't want to obsess over this all day.
[00:16:50.797 --> 00:16:52.479]  It's just a constant hassle.
[00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:57.603]  I mean, you've been seeing how much the site's been going down the last month because we're getting millions of visitors a week.
[00:16:57.603 --> 00:17:00.646]  We had millions yesterday on a day.
[00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:04.289]  We had to shut comments off because that was the biggest thing to take a man with.
[00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:08.052]  I want to bring Paul Watson up because I'm not an IT guy, neither is he, but he knows more than I do about this.
[00:17:08.052 --> 00:17:11.715]  And then, Kurt, in the next segment, that I'm shifting gears at the Charlie Sheen interview.
[00:17:11.715 --> 00:17:16.900]  Charlie Sheen also popping in live just for a few minutes to promo what's coming up later in the show.
[00:17:19.013 --> 00:17:26.199]  Watson, just in a nutshell, explain to me what's going on, how these servers work.
[00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:34.546]  Well, the thing about it is that, I mean, we were working intensively on this article Sunday of Monday.
[00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:39.590]  And then first it didn't have the hyperlinks, that's what I first noticed, and I said, why aren't they there?
[00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.131]  What caused that?
[00:17:41.131 --> 00:17:44.854]  I mean, things were added, taken out, links were added, taken out.
[00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:52.560]  I mean, I didn't even get the final version until literally two hours before it was going to be posted.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.884]  So I was adding different things, checking the grammar, checking the spelling.
[00:17:56.884 --> 00:18:08.693]  But what I'm told is, that's what WordPress does, is we stuck that image of a signature at the bottom, so often it then cuts off whatever's below that, which was the blurb about the audio of Sheen that day, and the link to your other article.
[00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:16.236]  Yeah, there were things that were supposed to be added at the bottom that then got pasted over by all this different stuff we were adding.
[00:18:16.236 --> 00:18:21.761]  And then we were literally struggling for about an hour to get it back in there.
[00:18:21.761 --> 00:18:29.488]  I mean, I was freaking out calling you, Alex, when you were in the shower during that half an hour to an hour.
[00:18:29.488 --> 00:18:29.968]  I remember.
[00:18:29.968 --> 00:18:34.432]  And we finally managed to get it back up.
[00:18:34.432 --> 00:18:35.974]  I don't want to start a conspiracy.
[00:18:37.298 --> 00:18:39.599]  But how often does that happen where it chops off?
[00:18:39.599 --> 00:18:40.860]  Kurt says it happens a lot to him.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.681]  I know you don't complain as much.
[00:18:42.681 --> 00:18:45.783]  How often does that happen?
[00:18:45.783 --> 00:18:53.347]  The issue with WordPress and... You see, with WordPress, you've got two ways in which you can input content.
[00:18:53.347 --> 00:18:58.989]  One is HTML view, which is time-consuming, but if you do it, then it comes out right.
[00:18:58.989 --> 00:19:01.191]  And the other one is visual view.
[00:19:01.191 --> 00:19:03.472]  But when you've pasted in different things from
[00:19:04.403 --> 00:19:12.207]  For example, a Word document or images or video, it can completely mess up everything that's underneath that.
[00:19:12.207 --> 00:19:14.949]  And when I said Kirk complains, he just is frustrated.
[00:19:14.949 --> 00:19:19.351]  He's in New Mexico and he says about a third of the time he can't get into the server.
[00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:27.996]  And then I guess we had such load hitting it at 8 o'clock that right before sites go down, which it then did both went down off and on, you couldn't get in.
[00:19:29.215 --> 00:19:32.157]  No, I mean, InfoWars was completely offline.
[00:19:32.157 --> 00:19:34.958]  PrisonPlanet.tv was completely offline.
[00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.020]  People couldn't even listen to the show.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.062]  Yeah, I mean, the site's crashed, folks, and so they were in there.
[00:19:41.062 --> 00:19:49.347]  That's the problem, is when they went to upload it, everybody hit the site, and I don't begin to understand all this, but that's what scrambles stuff.
[00:19:49.347 --> 00:19:49.907]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:19:49.907 --> 00:19:56.151]  I got Kurt popping in with his experiences with this, and then I'm going to shift gears and all the other news, but I wanted to explain this to people, okay?
[00:19:56.151 --> 00:19:58.272]  We did not not have the disclaimer on purpose.
[00:20:00.902 --> 00:20:02.223]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.223 --> 00:20:07.808]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:12.832]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:20:12.832 --> 00:20:18.397]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:20:18.397 --> 00:20:23.641]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:20:23.641 --> 00:20:25.483]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:20:25.922 --> 00:20:30.725]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:20:30.725 --> 00:20:31.846]  And here's the best part.
[00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:34.628]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:20:34.628 --> 00:20:38.530]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.732]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:41.732 --> 00:20:43.954]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:43.954 --> 00:20:44.895]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:20:44.895 --> 00:20:45.295]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:20:45.295 --> 00:20:46.215]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:57.572]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:20:57.572 --> 00:21:03.774]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:21:03.774 --> 00:21:04.454]  It's here.
[00:21:04.454 --> 00:21:09.596]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:21:09.596 --> 00:21:17.238]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:21:17.932 --> 00:21:25.375]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:21:25.375 --> 00:21:37.120]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.082]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:21:41.082 --> 00:21:43.343]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:21:43.343 --> 00:21:47.205]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:22:00.404 --> 00:22:01.445]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:06.408]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:14.473]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:14.473 --> 00:22:19.817]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:20.037 --> 00:22:27.322]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:27.322 --> 00:22:32.926]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:32.926 --> 00:22:37.990]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:45.935]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:45.935 --> 00:22:48.617]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:52.481]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:52.481 --> 00:22:56.344]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.344 --> 00:22:59.708]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.708 --> 00:23:05.693]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[00:23:05.693 --> 00:23:06.454]  Think about that.
[00:23:06.454 --> 00:23:09.057]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:23:09.557 --> 00:23:12.778]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:23:12.778 --> 00:23:23.043]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.
[00:23:23.043 --> 00:23:28.845]  Unlike hard to digest pills, Chews for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[00:23:28.845 --> 00:23:30.025]  The choice is yours.
[00:23:30.025 --> 00:23:35.628]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[00:23:35.628 --> 00:23:36.348]  Chews for Health.
[00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:46.197]  The world's first super fruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant, chewable, whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.
[00:23:46.197 --> 00:23:47.298]  1-800-210-1922.
[00:23:47.298 --> 00:23:51.783]  Call now and receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced Diet.

[00:23:52.003 --> 00:23:52.964]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.281]  Charlie, it's great to be here with you.
[00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:03.402]  I appreciate you doing this interview.
[00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:04.083]  Likewise, Alex.
[00:24:04.083 --> 00:24:04.783]  Thank you.
[00:24:04.783 --> 00:24:09.546]  Why, after three years of silence concerning 9-11, are you now speaking up?
[00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:15.250]  And why have you written this public letter that you've now published?
[00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.070]  Well, Alex...
[00:24:17.859 --> 00:24:20.821]  I wrote this letter for two reasons.
[00:24:20.821 --> 00:24:27.346]  Firstly, I wanted to create a public document specifically rooted in fact.
[00:24:27.346 --> 00:24:36.552]  If anybody dares question that, I would encourage those people to scrutinize it, to research it.
[00:24:36.552 --> 00:24:40.275]  The truth is unchanging, Alex, as we both know.
[00:24:40.275 --> 00:24:45.299]  The only aspects of this piece that had to be manufactured were the President's... Alright, folks!
[00:24:46.288 --> 00:24:49.710]  I want to give a shout out to Charlie Sheen listening right now from his home in Los Angeles.
[00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.592]  Charlie is coming up live in the next segment.
[00:24:52.592 --> 00:24:56.514]  Then we're going to play the tape interview I did with him in his home a few weeks ago.
[00:24:56.514 --> 00:24:58.795]  And then he's coming back up live Friday.
[00:24:58.795 --> 00:25:00.456]  And there's a special video he taped.
[00:25:00.456 --> 00:25:02.217]  This is only the beginning of this.
[00:25:02.217 --> 00:25:04.859]  But he's going to come on and tell you why he wrote the letter the way he did.
[00:25:06.277 --> 00:25:12.739]  Since for some that want to distract off the main issue of 9-11 Truth, they've turned it into somewhat of an issue.
[00:25:12.739 --> 00:25:15.940]  Regardless, ladies and gentlemen, government-sponsored terror is real and is happening.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.921]  But I wanted to go back to Paul Watson briefly and Kurt Nemo.
[00:25:20.921 --> 00:25:24.362]  Kurt Nemo, I know you were irritated yesterday.
[00:25:24.362 --> 00:25:28.383]  How often from New Mexico do your stories get cut off when you're uploading them?
[00:25:28.383 --> 00:25:30.084]  And how often can you not get into the server?
[00:25:31.297 --> 00:25:38.900]  Well, there's occasionally glitches when I post my stories, but really it's pretty minimal.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.881]  The servers are in pretty good shape compared to the way they were when we first started.
[00:25:41.881 --> 00:25:44.882]  Hey, nobody's griping at the IT guys.
[00:25:44.882 --> 00:25:46.562]  Tell the truth, Kurt.
[00:25:46.562 --> 00:25:48.783]  I am telling the truth.
[00:25:48.783 --> 00:25:51.324]  Constantly you're saying you can't get into the server or it's going down.
[00:25:51.324 --> 00:25:54.385]  I mean, by constantly, a few times a week is what you've told me at least.
[00:25:54.804 --> 00:26:02.467]  Well, sometimes the back end of it, where we actually put the content into the server, has problems, but I wouldn't say that it's a large issue.
[00:26:02.467 --> 00:26:05.229]  Oh, it wasn't an issue yesterday?
[00:26:05.229 --> 00:26:09.490]  Oh, definitely it was an issue yesterday, but that was because the server was getting hit with my request.
[00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.431]  I think I couldn't get in.
[00:26:11.556 --> 00:26:11.716]  Sure.
[00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:12.516]  Well, we have a great crew.
[00:26:12.516 --> 00:26:13.717]  Everybody's so nice to each other.
[00:26:13.717 --> 00:26:15.418]  It is not the IT guy's issue.
[00:26:15.418 --> 00:26:21.561]  It's the bandwidth issue, and that I demand a dynamic site with comments and photos and images.
[00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:23.762]  And we've had a bunch of other companies before that couldn't do it.
[00:26:23.762 --> 00:26:24.782]  My IT guys are the best.
[00:26:24.782 --> 00:26:32.506]  So I don't want to get sidetracked with trying to... But the issue was, yesterday, was the site not getting such massive traffic that you couldn't upload articles?
[00:26:32.506 --> 00:26:35.127]  And how many hours did it take you to even upload the Charlie Sheen photo?
[00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:39.323]  It took a couple hours on and off.
[00:26:39.323 --> 00:26:46.366]  I would get a connection and get in there and then I would get chopped off, but I think that's because the server was getting flooded with requests.
[00:26:46.366 --> 00:26:49.768]  I just wanted to, on record, and that's how Murphy's Law, though, works.
[00:26:49.768 --> 00:26:52.769]  You got some huge letter that has a disclaimer at the bottom and then some other links.
[00:26:52.769 --> 00:26:58.532]  Those weren't there either, about him being on the show and the clip and about the other article Paul wrote.
[00:26:58.532 --> 00:27:01.174]  I think four things were cut off the bottom, not just the disclaimer.
[00:27:02.014 --> 00:27:05.816]  And if we're wrong anywhere, maybe it should have been at the front, but Charlie has his reasons for that.
[00:27:05.816 --> 00:27:08.358]  I think he might be right, so we're going to have him on in a minute to talk about it.
[00:27:08.358 --> 00:27:09.958]  But that isn't what this is about.
[00:27:09.958 --> 00:27:16.862]  But that's what the PSYOP people want to make it about, and some people are taking the bait, unfortunately, is about how this was presented.
[00:27:16.862 --> 00:27:22.605]  It's presented to get people talking about it, but not in this intense a way.
[00:27:22.605 --> 00:27:27.308]  But bottom line, so we started getting massive traffic right at 8 when it was uploaded.
[00:27:27.308 --> 00:27:30.630]  That cut off some stuff because the image in between it is the way it's described.
[00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.310]  Anything else, Kurt?
[00:27:31.954 --> 00:27:33.777]  Well, I just wanted to comment on what Paul said.
[00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:43.491]  It's true with the editor on the back end, and I'm not sure if this is really important for the listeners per se, but if you use the visual editor and you try to stick content in, sometimes there's problems.
[00:27:43.491 --> 00:27:47.337]  I usually use the HTML editor because there's less problems with that.
[00:27:47.944 --> 00:27:55.269]  Well, it started with Watson uploading it without the bottom part, then instantly trying to get in, but by then it was 8 o'clock in the morning and everybody was hitting it.
[00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:56.510]  So it was just a perfect storm.
[00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:03.435]  This has taught me, do not launch major surprise guests with pre-announcements.
[00:28:03.435 --> 00:28:06.276]  I've always instinctively not done that.
[00:28:06.276 --> 00:28:08.118]  I just have kind of, hey, here's the surprise.
[00:28:09.878 --> 00:28:12.340]  Yeah, I mean, what we need to judge is the impact that it's had.
[00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:47.320]  You might argue that the disclaimer should have been at the top, but, in my view, that would have reduced the impact by about 50%.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.501]  And now we're seeing that impact.
[00:28:49.501 --> 00:28:49.841]  L.A.
[00:28:49.841 --> 00:28:52.422]  Times, Houston Chronicle, U.S.
[00:28:52.422 --> 00:28:54.163]  News & World Report.
[00:28:54.163 --> 00:29:00.224]  And in fact, my article coming out in about 10 minutes on Prison Planet is about how this U.S.
[00:29:00.224 --> 00:29:08.287]  News & World Report author uses what I call clichéd and completely unfounded terms of reference
[00:29:08.945 --> 00:29:24.889]  Because in attempting to smear Charlie Sheen as part of this conspiracy fringe, in his words, he says that 9-11 troopers are like the people who believe that the JFK assassination was not the work of Lee Harvey Oswald alone.
[00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:27.009]  That's 92% of Americans.
[00:29:27.009 --> 00:29:30.830]  At least, that's the majority of the population.
[00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:31.370]  Absolutely.
[00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.831]  Paul, is there any chance somebody hacked in and blocked you from uploading that?
[00:29:35.831 --> 00:29:36.852]  It's possible.
[00:29:36.852 --> 00:29:38.352]  We had a lot of issues yesterday.
[00:29:39.264 --> 00:29:40.686]  But I think it was traffic, probably.
[00:29:40.686 --> 00:29:43.909]  I mean, I don't want to blame it on hackers, though we have been hacked before.
[00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:44.329]  Officially.
[00:29:44.329 --> 00:29:45.931]  Alright, gentlemen, good job.
[00:29:45.931 --> 00:29:46.392]  Keep it up.
[00:29:46.392 --> 00:29:51.037]  Get all the news up there on Charlie Sheen and his courage.
[00:29:51.037 --> 00:29:52.418]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.418 --> 00:29:54.961]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.961 --> 00:29:57.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.282 --> 00:30:04.526]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:06.528]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:30:06.528 --> 00:30:15.056]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:30:15.056 --> 00:30:20.601]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:30:20.601 --> 00:30:22.223]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:30:22.463 --> 00:30:28.965]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:30:28.965 --> 00:30:40.027]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:30:40.027 --> 00:30:40.788]  That's right.
[00:30:40.788 --> 00:30:43.348]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:30:43.348 --> 00:30:44.949]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:30:46.889 --> 00:30:47.510]  We're good to go.
[00:31:01.283 --> 00:31:07.089]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.089 --> 00:31:14.677]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.677 --> 00:31:20.844]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.244 --> 00:31:23.226]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.226 --> 00:31:25.728]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.728 --> 00:31:37.296]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.296 --> 00:31:38.978]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.978 --> 00:31:40.839]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.839 --> 00:31:47.064]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.742 --> 00:31:55.987]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.987 --> 00:31:57.568]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.568 --> 00:32:00.830]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.511]  Okay, folks, quiz time.
[00:32:02.511 --> 00:32:12.937]  What resource takes care of your food needs at a moment's notice most of the year, is easily preserved for the rest of the year, is nutritious, abundant, forever GMO-free, and is free for the taking?
[00:32:12.937 --> 00:32:13.718]  Give up?
[00:32:13.718 --> 00:32:15.539]  Your answer is wild edible food.
[00:32:16.013 --> 00:32:22.173]  With Linda Runyon's whole enchilada package on your shelf, you'll never be high and dry when everyone else is up the creek without a paddle.
[00:32:22.173 --> 00:32:22.875]  In fact, you'll be
[00:32:25.776 --> 00:32:26.136]  We're good to go!
[00:32:55.899 --> 00:33:19.808]  Yeah, we need a hero, and he doesn't like being called one, but he is a real maverick, a real trailblazer, avant-garde in the fight for truth, in demanding the truth.
[00:33:21.158 --> 00:33:25.481]  Charlie Sheen live with us right now on 9-9-9.
[00:33:25.481 --> 00:33:31.025]  He'll be with us on 9-11 live for an extended interview, a taped interview coming up at the start of next hour.
[00:33:31.025 --> 00:33:34.888]  We got Richard Gage for Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth coming up after that.
[00:33:34.888 --> 00:33:36.709]  And Professor Steven Jones to counter.
[00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.891]  Hey, great to be here Alex, how are you?
[00:33:59.486 --> 00:34:01.648]  Oh, it's just, I'm really excited.
[00:34:01.648 --> 00:34:03.049]  This is hitting bigger than it did in 2006.
[00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:11.135]  It's in dozens and dozens and dozens of newspapers and going super viral and most of them are positive this time.
[00:34:11.135 --> 00:34:24.445]  Yeah, no, I'm completely excited by just what little I've had a chance to check out online and what some of my friends and family have sent me.
[00:34:24.445 --> 00:34:25.346]  No, this is exciting.
[00:34:25.346 --> 00:34:26.106]  This is important.
[00:34:27.847 --> 00:34:30.127]  This is the type of reaction I was hoping for.
[00:34:30.127 --> 00:34:50.951]  Um, I think we should cover something that, um, some of the articles I've read and some of the, some of the blogs and some of the comments have, uh, have criticized you and I for intentionally, uh, uh, the, the, the thing dealing with the disclaimer, uh, where people are, are insisting that we left it off, uh, originally.
[00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:52.411]  And that is not the case.
[00:34:52.411 --> 00:34:55.972]  This was always intended to be revealed at the end.
[00:34:56.872 --> 00:35:04.835]  As a fictional piece, and I think people felt misled when in fact it was an IT glitch.
[00:35:04.835 --> 00:35:06.936]  That's old Murphy's Law.
[00:35:06.936 --> 00:35:09.558]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:35:09.558 --> 00:35:23.924]  But I had, you know, it's like you and I had talked about, we had struggled with putting this thing at the beginning or at the bottom, but I felt if it was at the bottom, then if anybody, if it was at the top, right,
[00:35:25.296 --> 00:35:40.508]  I was afraid people would tune out or just dismiss it as a fluff piece, so I wanted to get people interested, get them engaged in the interview, in the piece, and then understand that it was a work of fiction.
[00:35:40.508 --> 00:35:52.497]  However, the intent of the piece was to generate enough interest, enough excitement, enough momentum to have this actually come across the President's desk.
[00:35:53.243 --> 00:36:02.470]  And my fantasy scenario would be to be granted my 20 minutes with my president.
[00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.571]  That's the big announcement.
[00:36:03.571 --> 00:36:17.401]  I mean, in your own words, you want to meet with Barack Obama, and you went further in some things that are coming up really soon, that you want other people to go to their congressmen, their senators, and the six of the ten commissioners.
[00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:18.762]  I mean, explain that to people, Charlie.
[00:36:19.431 --> 00:36:37.394]  Well, yeah, because, you know, some of the other stuff that I've been reading since this came out is that, you know, Charlie Sheen thinks this, or Charlie Sheen is insisting this, and that is, it's a typical mainstream spin on what the intent of the piece really is.
[00:36:40.054 --> 00:36:53.782]  It's a compilation, it's a formulation of a host of really hard facts and really strong evidence that is not my opinion.
[00:36:53.782 --> 00:36:58.105]  They're not things that I have come up with on my own.
[00:36:58.105 --> 00:37:06.490]  These are the observations and the realities put forth by people a thousand times smarter than me.
[00:37:06.963 --> 00:37:35.016]  People that do this for a living, you know, so I thought it was important to put it all into one document where even the naysayers would look at it and it's just typical when they can't attack the facts, they attack the person, you know, and that's what they're engaged in and it's what I expect, that it's fine, it's what they do, but yeah, I think when, if you can divorce yourself from who wrote this, why it was written,
[00:37:35.858 --> 00:37:45.203]  And just look at those facts, and I think it really begs to be explored deeper.
[00:37:45.203 --> 00:37:48.485]  Well, I mean, this was designed to make the neocons grab a hold of it.
[00:37:48.485 --> 00:37:52.247]  I mean, we want them to go look at the 20 points.
[00:37:52.247 --> 00:37:54.188]  I mean, look at these points, Charlie.
[00:37:54.188 --> 00:38:01.853]  I know you think the strongest, and I agree with you, is what the members of the Commission said and two of the five council.
[00:38:01.853 --> 00:38:04.214]  I mean, in your words, give us a comment on that.
[00:38:05.623 --> 00:38:23.213]  Well, I think if anybody brings up the Reuters piece that came out last night, I think they mentioned the commission member aspect of the piece no less than five times.
[00:38:23.213 --> 00:38:30.998]  So I think even they saw the true value of that and the true damning implication of that.
[00:38:32.904 --> 00:38:43.533]  And so they were very smart to jump on that as a key aspect of the document.
[00:38:43.533 --> 00:38:58.946]  I'm hoping as this builds momentum, as it picks up steam, as it garners more attention, that this will force some of these commissioners, if not all of them, out into the open to comment on this.
[00:39:00.583 --> 00:39:07.087]  So we're not misleading people, misquoting them, misguiding anybody in any capacity.
[00:39:31.523 --> 00:39:49.307]  Uh, well, it's just the way things work today and I, um, you know, uh, hopefully with, um, you know, having written this and, and, uh, with what we're doing, hopefully we can, uh, we can pull back the curtain on some of this stuff, you know?
[00:39:49.307 --> 00:39:51.088]  And just to be clear, go ahead.
[00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:54.949]  I'm sorry, Alex, um, but this is just me asking questions.
[00:39:54.949 --> 00:40:00.150]  This is not me having solved everything or having an idea of what went down or how it
[00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:02.279]  How it went down or how it didn't go down.
[00:40:02.279 --> 00:40:04.400]  This is just a guy with questions.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.501]  A guy who voted for a president.
[00:40:06.501 --> 00:40:14.205]  A guy whose tax dollars support wars that I don't support personally, emotionally.
[00:40:14.205 --> 00:40:22.388]  And so I feel like I have a right to request this time to ask these questions.
[00:40:22.388 --> 00:40:26.350]  And the good news for Obama is that he's already got my questions.
[00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.331]  He's already got the document.
[00:40:28.331 --> 00:40:29.692]  But there's no surprises, you know?
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.541]  Absolutely.
[00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:39.548]  I want to play a clip and then we're going to come back and get one more comment from you and then we'll cover more coming up on Friday.
[00:40:39.548 --> 00:40:42.210]  And I really appreciate your time and your courage, Charlie.
[00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:42.991]  Let's play this clip.
[00:40:42.991 --> 00:40:49.377]  This is the first minute and a half of a 20 plus minute interview I'm going to be airing for the first time coming up in the next hour.
[00:40:49.377 --> 00:40:53.401]  But then I want you to comment on this after we're done playing it.
[00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:53.741]  Here it is.
[00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:54.302]  Okay, great.
[00:40:54.722 --> 00:40:56.003]  Charlie, it's great to be here with you.
[00:40:56.003 --> 00:40:58.124]  I appreciate you doing this interview.
[00:40:58.124 --> 00:40:58.804]  Likewise, Alex.
[00:40:58.804 --> 00:40:59.505]  Thank you.
[00:40:59.505 --> 00:41:04.267]  Why, after three years of silence concerning 9-11, are you now speaking up?
[00:41:04.267 --> 00:41:09.971]  And why haven't you written this public letter that you've now published?
[00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:10.791]  Well, Alex...
[00:41:12.586 --> 00:41:15.529]  I wrote this letter for two reasons.
[00:41:15.529 --> 00:41:22.077]  Firstly, I wanted to create a public document specifically rooted in fact.
[00:41:22.077 --> 00:41:29.505]  If anybody dares question that, I would encourage those people to scrutinize it, to research it.
[00:41:31.267 --> 00:41:34.989]  The truth is unchanging, Alex, as we both know.
[00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:40.433]  The only aspect of this piece that had to be manufactured were the President's words.
[00:41:40.433 --> 00:41:46.837]  Everything else will withstand the critical assault I'm more than prepared to endure.
[00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:54.861]  And secondly, this is our first new President since 9-11, and consequently his first 9-11 anniversary in office.
[00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:58.015]  Enough stonewalling.
[00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:00.296]  Enough media manipulation.
[00:42:00.296 --> 00:42:03.358]  Enough media mantra speak.
[00:42:03.358 --> 00:42:05.580]  The families deserve better, Alex.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.481]  America deserves better.
[00:42:07.481 --> 00:42:08.842]  I mean, come on.
[00:42:08.842 --> 00:42:09.662]  Come on, people.
[00:42:09.662 --> 00:42:14.606]  The 9-11 Commission report is a blatant work of manipulation, secrecy, and fiction.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.442]  Come on, the time is now.
[00:42:17.442 --> 00:42:19.784]  Demand the truth.
[00:42:19.784 --> 00:42:28.631]  I personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right into our Congress.
[00:42:28.631 --> 00:42:30.172]  We have to take action.
[00:42:30.172 --> 00:42:31.153]  We have to stand as one.
[00:42:31.153 --> 00:42:34.296]  We must insist that our new president deliver on his promises.
[00:42:36.246 --> 00:42:47.554]  Charlie Sheen, we're going to go over your 20 minutes with the President and the actual 20 points coming up on an extended live interview Friday, but I know you've got to get to work, but anything else you'd like to add?
[00:42:47.554 --> 00:43:03.346]  Yeah, I think it's important that people know that I did write this, that this is Charlie Sheen, that these are my words, that this is my document, that there's no question about that, because I understand there was some confusion or some doubting.
[00:43:04.199 --> 00:43:08.021]  I had news media calling me saying, prove this is Charlie Sheen yesterday, but go ahead.
[00:43:08.021 --> 00:43:14.284]  You can play this part for them, if they do in fact continue to make that call.
[00:43:14.284 --> 00:43:23.167]  But yeah, I guess I should take that as some measure of flattery, that they didn't think I was capable of writing this.
[00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:29.250]  But no, I did write it, and it's from my heart.
[00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:30.291]  It's for the families.
[00:43:32.563 --> 00:43:59.601]  It's for all of America and the rest of the free world, and I just think that, you know, with our first president, our first new president, since the event, that it was a perfect opportunity with his first anniversary coming up, that he be asked, if not forced at some point, to take a look at these hard facts and all this evidence and put the ball in his court.
[00:44:02.222 --> 00:44:16.153]  In closing, if the President doesn't meet with you or doesn't answer these questions about six of the ten members of the Commission saying the Commission was a fraud and a lie, what are you calling for?
[00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.574]  I'm calling for an uprising.
[00:44:17.574 --> 00:44:31.865]  I'm calling for each and every American that wants his country back, his or her country back, to wake up, stand up, and join the cause.
[00:44:32.398 --> 00:44:39.583]  I just know that things aren't what they used to be.
[00:44:39.583 --> 00:44:42.405]  Things aren't how they seem.
[00:44:42.405 --> 00:44:49.751]  It's time that everybody take note of that and get active.
[00:44:49.751 --> 00:44:50.511]  Some uprising?
[00:44:50.511 --> 00:44:54.534]  You mean a peaceful revolution of 9-11 truth?
[00:44:54.534 --> 00:44:55.235]  Yes.
[00:44:55.235 --> 00:44:57.457]  Yes.
[00:44:57.457 --> 00:44:57.737]  Yes.
[00:44:57.737 --> 00:44:59.818]  This is a call to arms.
[00:44:59.818 --> 00:45:00.599]  Intellectual arms.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.160]  Absolutely.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:14.264]  Okay, Charlie Sheen, thank you so much for the time, and we'll be speaking to you Friday at 1.30 Central, 11.30 Pacific, my friend.
[00:45:14.264 --> 00:45:16.065]  I will look forward to that, Alex.
[00:45:16.065 --> 00:45:22.867]  Thank you so much for all your support, and I thank all the NFL Warriors and everybody else for all their support as well.
[00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:23.647]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:45:23.647 --> 00:45:24.508]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:45:24.508 --> 00:45:25.248]  Back at you, Alex.
[00:45:25.248 --> 00:45:25.548]  Thank you.
[00:45:26.189 --> 00:45:32.110]  All right, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen, Charlie Sheen, and there you have it.
[00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:46.354]  I had Reuters and other people, CNN call over here, and then I was talking to the PR Newswire, and they were saying, yeah, AP and Reuters separately, and others, they want to know this is real.
[00:45:47.165 --> 00:45:48.966]  And I said, look, I've interviewed Charlie Sheen before.
[00:45:48.966 --> 00:45:50.466]  I mean, they could just Google the fact.
[00:45:50.466 --> 00:45:53.387]  They can listen to the audio we played yesterday.
[00:45:53.387 --> 00:45:59.389]  And I mean, that's what the establishment does to divert and to distract.
[00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:02.230]  They just continue to throw up those obstacles.
[00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:09.032]  But the American people and the people of the world aren't going along with this in any way.
[00:46:11.045 --> 00:46:16.869]  And people are aware of false flag terrorism, of self-inflicted wounds.
[00:46:16.869 --> 00:46:19.851]  The population before 9-11 was not aware.
[00:46:19.851 --> 00:46:25.714]  Maybe 1% of the population was aware of the term false flag, or self-inflicted wound, or inside job.
[00:46:25.714 --> 00:46:37.142]  Now, even some of the dumbest of the dumb, some of the most tuned out, you know, people who are totally tuned out of reality, tuned into mainstream media, they know what inside job means.
[00:46:37.142 --> 00:46:39.063]  You know, most crimes are inside jobs.
[00:46:40.566 --> 00:46:48.411]  Most crimes are committed from the inside out.
[00:46:48.411 --> 00:46:54.836]  Most robberies, the list, the list just goes on and on.
[00:46:54.836 --> 00:46:56.357]  And there is just so much news.
[00:46:57.776 --> 00:47:12.996]  Here in my stack that I want to go over today and we're going to do that and we're going to shift gears into talking about 9-11 and talk about the Empire Striking Back, the declaration of war by the establishment media against the American people.
[00:47:14.127 --> 00:47:21.832]  And against the people of the world, how they're coming out and with all these different debunking pieces on 9-11 truth, all full of fraud, lies, distortions.
[00:47:21.832 --> 00:47:25.354]  I mean, they're trying to resurface the popular mechanics.
[00:47:25.354 --> 00:47:29.056]  Hearst publishing fathers of yellow journalism pieces.
[00:47:29.056 --> 00:47:31.538]  You supply the pictures, I'll supply the war.
[00:47:31.538 --> 00:47:37.042]  William Randolph Hearst told Remington the painter.
[00:47:37.042 --> 00:47:39.803]  This is how they work.
[00:47:39.803 --> 00:47:40.804]  This is how they operate.
[00:47:41.943 --> 00:47:54.727]  But we are standing up and getting involved and saying at the town halls, at the tea parties, at these events, 9-11 truth needs to be put front and center.
[00:47:54.727 --> 00:47:56.407]  Here is Star Pulse.
[00:47:56.407 --> 00:47:58.588]  Charlie Sheen writes to President Obama over 9-11.
[00:48:02.438 --> 00:48:06.041]  Here is another one from the Street Insider, Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:06.041 --> 00:48:09.124]  Charlie Sheen requests a meeting with Obama over 9-11 cover-up.
[00:48:09.124 --> 00:48:16.852]  Reuters, Charlie Sheen requests a meeting with Obama over 9-11 cover-up.
[00:48:16.852 --> 00:48:22.017]  And there's just a whole bunch of other news articles here.
[00:48:22.017 --> 00:48:27.342]  The Examiner, Charlie Sheen update with Google censoring any pro-Obama stories confirmed.
[00:48:28.752 --> 00:48:30.333]  The negative ones go right to the top.
[00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:31.194]  Peter Roth.
[00:48:31.194 --> 00:48:35.597]  Charlie Sheen joins the 9-11 conspiracy theory fringe.
[00:48:35.597 --> 00:48:40.681]  That's the big hit piece.
[00:48:40.681 --> 00:48:46.066]  And the New York Post has on their page six, two and a half screws loose.
[00:48:46.066 --> 00:48:47.587]  Another attack piece.
[00:48:47.587 --> 00:48:50.329]  A pretty positive piece from the Los Angeles Times.
[00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:52.130]  Top of the ticket.
[00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:54.432]  That's their top political column.
[00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:54.873]  Breaking.
[00:48:54.873 --> 00:48:57.835]  Charlie Sheen demands Obama meeting on 9-11 cover-up.
[00:49:01.169 --> 00:49:04.211]  So, that's the type of news.
[00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:07.733]  I have a Houston Chronicle here somewhere, but I can't seem to find one.
[00:49:07.733 --> 00:49:13.357]  Here's Gawker, one of the big gossip sites.
[00:49:13.357 --> 00:49:19.841]  Charlie Sheen, fantasy 9-1-1, truth or grilling of the president.
[00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:22.362]  Here is another one out of Associated Content.
[00:49:22.362 --> 00:49:27.305]  Barack Obama, Charlie Sheen, Van Jones, the 9-11 truth movement.
[00:49:27.305 --> 00:49:30.107]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:49:34.107 --> 00:49:37.769]  There's another one here out of, I mean there's just too many of these to even keep track of.
[00:49:37.769 --> 00:49:42.111]  I don't know where my Houston Chronicle is, but that's another one.
[00:49:42.111 --> 00:49:43.572]  So, just too many of these.
[00:49:43.572 --> 00:49:48.074]  They're walking in and stacking these on my desk as fast as they can print them.
[00:49:48.074 --> 00:49:49.895]  And, good job Charlie!
[00:49:49.895 --> 00:49:52.636]  He wanted to put this front and center knowing he'd be attacked.
[00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:54.677]  People out there that enjoy attacking him like U.S.
[00:49:54.677 --> 00:50:00.240]  News and World Report, and like no doubt Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity will do, that's the whole plan!
[00:50:02.022 --> 00:50:06.847]  You know, people attacking me and, you know, glad at glitches or anything we've had.
[00:50:06.847 --> 00:50:10.391]  They only make us, this radio show, bigger and more effective.
[00:50:10.391 --> 00:50:15.376]  It's just not really fun to be up on the pedestal and everybody throwing eggs at you.
[00:50:15.376 --> 00:50:17.699]  But that's what people like that do.
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:27.805]  Teddy Roosevelt say, it is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:50:27.805 --> 00:50:47.097]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcomings, but who does actually strive to do the deed.
[00:50:48.097 --> 00:50:53.320]  I'm gonna finish this quote when we come back and get into a bunch of other news here.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:51:00.945]  They're openly announcing the world government today!
[00:51:00.945 --> 00:51:07.649]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[00:51:07.649 --> 00:51:09.330]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:13.893]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[00:51:13.893 --> 00:51:15.654]  But because this is not a cigarette,
[00:51:15.794 --> 00:51:21.560]  You don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:26.445]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire and has no dangerous second-hand smoke.
[00:51:26.445 --> 00:51:32.391]  So it's safe for the people around you and will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.
[00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:36.394]  So, get rid of the ashtrays, the smell, and the smoke.

[00:52:00.919 --> 00:52:07.662]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.662 --> 00:52:10.303]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.303 --> 00:52:11.863]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.863 --> 00:52:12.644]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.644 --> 00:52:13.724]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:13.724 --> 00:52:15.025]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:15.025 --> 00:52:17.025]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.025 --> 00:52:24.168]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.168 --> 00:52:24.649]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.649 --> 00:52:30.291]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.991 --> 00:52:34.474]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.474 --> 00:52:36.656]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.796 --> 00:53:01.897]  Hi, Ed Schultz here.
[00:53:01.897 --> 00:53:05.860]  I want to tell you about BioGreenClean.com.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.461]  BioGreenClean.
[00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:14.807]  It is absolutely the first heavy-duty, all-natural, multi-purpose cleaner that outperforms all competitive cleaners.
[00:53:14.807 --> 00:53:16.529]  BioGreenClean is the product.
[00:53:16.989 --> 00:53:22.696]  It's tough enough to take on virtually any cleaning challenge, yet gentle enough for your baby's toys.
[00:53:22.696 --> 00:53:23.296]  That's right.
[00:53:23.296 --> 00:53:29.744]  BioGreen Clean is plant-derived and contains no harmful chemicals, solvents, and no annoying fragrances.
[00:53:29.744 --> 00:53:36.632]  If you want spectacular and unprecedented results from a revolutionary cleaning product, look no further.

[00:53:44.279 --> 00:53:47.662]  Just go to www.biogreenclean.com.
[00:53:47.662 --> 00:53:51.185]  That's www.biogreenclean.com.
[00:53:51.185 --> 00:53:54.968]  B-I-O-G-R-E-E-N-C-L-E-A-N.com.
[00:53:54.968 --> 00:53:55.969]  Try it today.
[00:53:55.969 --> 00:53:57.350]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:58.732]  BioGreenClean.
[00:53:58.732 --> 00:54:00.053]  It cleans anything.
[00:54:07.887 --> 00:54:16.355]  It's not the critic who counts, not the man who points out if a strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:54:16.355 --> 00:54:26.564]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who eras, and comes up short again and again.
[00:54:26.564 --> 00:54:30.348]  Because there is not effort without error and shortcomings.
[00:54:31.803 --> 00:54:33.924]  But who does actually strive to do the deed?
[00:54:33.924 --> 00:54:36.805]  Who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions?
[00:54:36.805 --> 00:54:38.646]  Who spends himself on a worthy cause?
[00:54:38.646 --> 00:54:42.428]  Who, at best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement?
[00:54:42.428 --> 00:54:51.512]  And who, at worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[00:54:51.512 --> 00:54:55.574]  And, you know, that describes Charlie Sheen, a doer of deeds.
[00:54:55.574 --> 00:54:56.634]  And I know him very well.
[00:54:56.634 --> 00:54:58.215]  He's a very special person.
[00:54:59.355 --> 00:55:05.057]  I know a lot of big celebrities, folks, who are even bigger than Charlie and are scared to go public with what they know.
[00:55:05.057 --> 00:55:06.478]  And they won't do it.
[00:55:06.478 --> 00:55:11.080]  And there's not many people bigger than Charlie Sheen, so that gives you an idea of who these people are.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:21.584]  And I think about Luke Radowski of We Are Change, kicked out of 9-11 Truth in New York, shut down, went and started his own groups, grew into hundreds around the world, has police come up, arresting people, come out of dark
[00:55:22.409 --> 00:55:26.652]  Alleyways with people on wheelchairs running into We Are Change.
[00:55:26.652 --> 00:55:28.053]  They have to then expose it's a fraud.
[00:55:28.053 --> 00:55:29.654]  Go to court and prove it.
[00:55:29.654 --> 00:55:32.235]  Luke's been arrested for going to public press conferences.
[00:55:32.235 --> 00:55:35.797]  He's had police come up and say we're gonna say you have bombs and guns and put you in prison.
[00:55:35.797 --> 00:55:37.399]  We know you're innocent, but we don't care.
[00:55:37.399 --> 00:55:38.399]  On video.
[00:55:38.399 --> 00:55:39.820]  This is the hell we go through.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.522]  Mark Cuban with them trying to indict him.
[00:55:42.522 --> 00:55:43.642]  Indicting him.
[00:55:43.642 --> 00:55:46.404]  And then the email saying we're gonna get you for 9-11 Truth.
[00:55:46.404 --> 00:55:47.125]  This is real.
[00:55:47.825 --> 00:55:53.131]  So take Charlie's call and get out there and expand 9-11 truth because it is hurting the establishment.
[00:55:53.131 --> 00:55:55.654]  That's why they're trying to counter us.
[00:55:55.654 --> 00:55:59.578]  Luke Rodowski, I want to talk about some of the 9-11 events coming up in New York this year.
[00:55:59.578 --> 00:56:03.062]  I couldn't be there because I was launching this, but I couldn't tell you what we were going to launch.
[00:56:03.062 --> 00:56:04.784]  But we're going to talk about that in a moment.
[00:56:04.784 --> 00:56:07.647]  First off, what do you think of this whole Charlie Sheen thing?
[00:56:07.647 --> 00:56:08.588]  How exciting is that?
[00:56:09.465 --> 00:56:20.456]  I mean, it's exciting, he's reinvigorating this whole Not 11 Truth moment, and he's letting people know he's pretty much reversing the course of history and changing the tide that we're all going against right now.
[00:56:20.456 --> 00:56:28.584]  And it's incredible knowing that big-name celebrities like Charlie Sheen are putting everything on the line because they believe in something bigger than anything.
[00:56:28.584 --> 00:56:32.869]  And it's amazing seeing people come out of everywhere to support this message of truth.
[00:56:34.551 --> 00:56:35.031]  Absolutely.
[00:56:35.031 --> 00:57:01.040]  Well, he wanted to do it because he's sick of seeing the 9-11 families being used by the government, saying, oh, the 9-11 families want a police state, they want wars, when the head of the biggest group, Mr. Doyle, on this show three years ago said the majority of them think it's an inside job, and they've protested around the White House, and I've talked to the families and the survivors, and the majority of them say inside job, and then the media will never cover it, just like they won't cover that six of the ten commission members said it was a criminal fraud.
[00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:09.534]  And exactly, and the majority of the victims' family members, especially the ones I work with, we are changed and are part of, we are changed.
[00:57:09.534 --> 00:57:19.061]  They are just sick of their loved ones being used to prophesize an agenda of war and slavery and intolerance and ignorance, and we're taking that name back.
[00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:27.628]  We're going to be doing that just like we do every year on 9-11, with the victims, with the rescue workers, with the survivors, with police and military in the streets of New York City.
[00:57:27.628 --> 00:57:30.710]  Every year, we take the name back for what it really is, and we take
[00:57:41.426 --> 00:57:41.987]  Absolutely.
[00:57:41.987 --> 00:57:45.608]  Well, the big news, Luke, is not just his letter or Charlie coming on the show.
[00:57:45.608 --> 00:57:48.890]  We're going to be hearing a never-before-interview with him next hour.
[00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:57.874]  The big news is that he is calling for a declaration of truth against the lie of 9-11 and a call to arms in the InfoWar.
[00:57:57.874 --> 00:57:58.454]  Did you hear that?
[00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:03.136]  I did not hear that, but that's incredible news and I'm really very excited to hear that.
[00:58:09.912 --> 00:58:11.313]  I mean, we're going to start off tomorrow.
[00:58:11.313 --> 00:58:12.394]  We're doing a street action.
[00:58:12.394 --> 00:58:14.696]  Starting at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:58:14.696 --> 00:58:16.577]  We're going to David Rockefeller's house.
[00:58:16.577 --> 00:58:18.759]  Marching all around New York City tomorrow.
[00:58:18.759 --> 00:58:23.342]  And then we're going to have an event with learning seminars where we're going to teach people how to be activist journalists.
[00:58:23.342 --> 00:58:25.363]  How to have technology to help the info war.
[00:58:25.363 --> 00:58:26.704]  How to grow their own food.
[00:58:26.704 --> 00:58:28.526]  And we're going to get ready for the big day.
[00:58:28.526 --> 00:58:31.808]  That's September 11, 2009.
[00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:33.349]  Eight years after the tragedy of 9-11.
[00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:35.351]  We're going to have a huge demonstration.
[00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:36.852]  WeAreChange.org.
[00:58:36.852 --> 00:58:37.232]  Stay there.
[00:58:37.232 --> 00:58:38.293]  We'll be back in one minute.

[00:58:50.406 --> 00:58:55.708]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.708 --> 00:59:00.231]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:59:00.231 --> 00:59:02.512]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:02.512 --> 00:59:04.132]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:04.132 --> 00:59:05.173]  There is a solution.
[00:59:05.413 --> 00:59:13.815]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:59:55.837 --> 01:00:01.099]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:01.879]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:08.321]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.321 --> 01:00:10.083]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:11.665]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.665 --> 01:00:13.207]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.207 --> 01:00:17.411]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.411 --> 01:00:21.476]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:32.071]  People got mad about Obama wanting to federalize education and start indoctrination seminars.
[01:00:32.071 --> 01:00:33.974]  That was in the original document.
[01:00:33.974 --> 01:00:35.176]  Are really going to get upset.
[01:00:35.176 --> 01:00:45.229]  USA Today, 9-1-1 education to be initiated in schools all over the country and with federal funding, brainwashing them with the official story, inducting them into the police state.
[01:00:47.659 --> 01:00:51.004]  Let's go back to Luke Radowski of WeAreChange.org, the founder.
[01:00:51.004 --> 01:00:53.148]  Big events coming up in New York and around the country.
[01:00:53.148 --> 01:00:55.191]  Find out about it at WeAreChange.org.
[01:00:55.191 --> 01:01:01.822]  Luke, tell folks, you've got what John Fugel is saying, host of America's Funniest Videos, a lot of other people that are going to be out at the events this year.
[01:01:02.472 --> 01:01:04.373]  Yeah, we're going to have Comedy Central Comedians.
[01:01:04.373 --> 01:01:09.417]  That's a big event happening this Saturday that we're having at Cooper Union, a big 1,000-seat hall.
[01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:16.222]  So we're going to have comedy, we're going to have mainstream hip-hop artists like Papoose and other surprise guests coming in.
[01:01:16.222 --> 01:01:19.564]  Willie Rodriguez is also going to be there showing Sneak Peek of his new film.
[01:01:19.564 --> 01:01:26.109]  It's going to be a great event this Saturday, and all the profits, all the money made is going straight to charity, up and out.
[01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:31.933]  The sick and dying policemen and military men and firefighters who need the help more than ever this year.
[01:01:32.573 --> 01:01:34.534]  And it's going to be an incredible show.
[01:01:34.534 --> 01:01:36.315]  We're doing street action every single day.
[01:01:36.315 --> 01:01:37.895]  We got the permits in hand.
[01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:39.576]  We got the bullhorns ready.
[01:01:39.576 --> 01:01:40.997]  Everybody come out to New York City.
[01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.897]  It's going to be an amazing experience.
[01:01:42.897 --> 01:01:44.458]  And it all started eight years ago.
[01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:47.099]  And we have to make sure we finish it off here in New York City.
[01:01:47.099 --> 01:01:48.340]  This is the belly of the beast.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.720]  This is where it all happened.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.481]  And this is where we want it to end.
[01:01:51.481 --> 01:01:53.642]  And this is where we're going to go full force.
[01:01:54.162 --> 01:02:23.383]  In the streets, dropping info bombs every single day, at the same time educating our activists how to be effective journalists, how to be effective activists, how to talk to the police, and at the same time doing something that should have been done years ago, and that's helping out those in need, and showing the police and military that we stand with them in the struggle against the elite, the New World Order, whatever you want to call them, and making them understand that we are here for them, and they should be with us in this stand, in this struggle,
[01:02:28.647 --> 01:02:36.013]  I can hear a lady out there, and you're going to college, you're doing a TV show, you're about to start a mainstream radio show in New York.
[01:02:36.013 --> 01:02:36.994]  What, 22?
[01:02:36.994 --> 01:02:41.858]  How old are you now, Luke?
[01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:50.265]  23, so look at an example of what one young man who saw my police state videos and woke up has done.
[01:02:50.265 --> 01:02:51.987]  What, you've been active four or five years now, Luke?
[01:02:52.685 --> 01:02:55.247]  Yes, we're about five, six years now, and we can do anything.
[01:02:55.247 --> 01:02:56.708]  I mean, anything is possible.
[01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.589]  Nothing is impossible.
[01:02:58.589 --> 01:03:02.032]  And we have to understand that our destiny is in our hands.
[01:03:02.032 --> 01:03:04.654]  We can do anything we want as long as we believe in it.
[01:03:04.654 --> 01:03:06.895]  And what we want, we can make happen.
[01:03:06.895 --> 01:03:14.801]  And we all have to understand that defeat is not possible unless we make it possible.
[01:03:14.801 --> 01:03:15.441]  Absolutely.
[01:03:15.441 --> 01:03:20.165]  And people can find out where you're going to be, where the demonstrations, where the rallies are going to be, all of it at wearechange.org.
[01:03:21.377 --> 01:03:22.137]  Yes, we are, James.
[01:03:22.137 --> 01:03:23.198]  Everything's on there.
[01:03:23.198 --> 01:03:28.720]  We're doing a Money Bomber on September 11th and September 12th, raising money for first responders on our website as well.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.560]  I'm asking people to come out to contribute.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:38.584]  We're going to have live video streams of everything happening in New York City starting tomorrow at David Rockefeller's house at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:03:38.584 --> 01:03:40.164]  We're going to be hitting the streets hard.
[01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:46.827]  We've got the permits in hand, and it's just going to be an incredible week coming up this whole, you know, this tomorrow, starting off everything.
[01:03:46.827 --> 01:03:47.447]  I just can't wait.
[01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:49.950]  Folks, get to New York.
[01:03:49.950 --> 01:04:01.620]  Let's have it be the biggest ever because, Luke, in closing, have you seen all these news articles how they're going to indoctrinate all the kids in schools nationwide about the official story and teach them how to be slaves and teach them the police state's good?
[01:04:02.711 --> 01:04:08.073]  Of course, and that's why you have the mainstream media running hit pieces against us, because it's a part of their indoctrination.
[01:04:08.073 --> 01:04:13.676]  They're doing everything they can, they're pulling all the stops to make sure our message doesn't get out.
[01:04:13.676 --> 01:04:19.878]  And our message is so powerful because it's so true, and there's so much love within it, that it cannot be stopped.
[01:04:19.878 --> 01:04:24.300]  So they're doing everything, indoctrinating the kids, putting out major mainstream hit pieces against us.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.141]  But they cannot stop us.
[01:04:26.141 --> 01:04:33.843]  They know they can't stop us, because this idea, this virtue, this humanity within us is coming out, and there's nothing stopping it.
[01:04:33.843 --> 01:04:36.444]  Look, I want to get live reports from you on the street Thursday and Friday.
[01:04:36.444 --> 01:04:44.107]  We're going to have Manny Medeo on with a petition to get a real 9-11 investigation at the city and state level, all coming up this week.
[01:04:44.107 --> 01:04:46.208]  Thank you so much, Luke Radowsky.
[01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:46.908]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:46.908 --> 01:04:47.808]  It's going to be incredible.
[01:04:47.808 --> 01:04:49.749]  I hope everybody can come out to New York City.
[01:04:49.749 --> 01:04:50.669]  It's going to be worthwhile.
[01:04:50.669 --> 01:04:51.890]  We're going to take everything back.
[01:04:52.594 --> 01:04:53.895]  Alright, God bless you.
[01:04:53.895 --> 01:04:55.076]  God bless you, thank you.
[01:04:55.076 --> 01:04:55.376]  You bet.
[01:04:55.376 --> 01:04:56.556]  Another hero, Luke Rodowski.
[01:04:56.556 --> 01:04:57.557]  A lot of courage.
[01:04:57.557 --> 01:04:58.638]  Charlie Sheen, coming up.
[01:04:58.638 --> 01:05:00.659]  Never before heard interview.
[01:05:00.659 --> 01:05:05.862]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:05.862 --> 01:05:09.904]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.904 --> 01:05:15.488]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.788 --> 01:05:16.428]  It's true.
[01:05:16.428 --> 01:05:21.791]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:28.073]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:05:28.073 --> 01:05:30.974]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:05:30.974 --> 01:05:35.496]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:39.098]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.338 --> 01:05:45.083]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:49.767]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:01.018 --> 01:06:04.021]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:04.021 --> 01:06:09.366]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:11.408]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.408 --> 01:06:16.412]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.412 --> 01:06:17.593]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.593 --> 01:06:18.714]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.714 --> 01:06:20.596]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.596 --> 01:06:21.677]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:23.699]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.899 --> 01:06:25.200]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.721]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:31.984]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.984 --> 01:06:35.587]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.587 --> 01:06:39.049]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.389 --> 01:06:40.630]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:41.531]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:42.631]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:43.552]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.552 --> 01:06:44.653]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.653 --> 01:06:47.695]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:08:01.268 --> 01:08:06.791]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.443 --> 01:08:25.946]  Okay, it'll take two segments to play this interview.
[01:08:25.946 --> 01:08:28.908]  I taped this at Charlie Sheen's home a few weeks ago.
[01:08:28.908 --> 01:08:37.095]  About a week and a half ago, when I was last there, we taped a video, but we've edited a special presentation that's going to be airing Thursday.
[01:08:37.095 --> 01:08:41.039]  I was talking to Charlie, though, and he thought, well, I thought that's going to air Friday.
[01:08:41.039 --> 01:08:41.979]  So we might air it Friday.
[01:08:41.979 --> 01:08:42.280]  I don't know.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.822]  He'll be back live for 30 minutes, maybe longer.
[01:08:47.113 --> 01:08:49.814]  He wanted to just come on a few minutes today and I could tell he was ready to keep going.
[01:08:49.814 --> 01:08:51.134]  He's just a great guy.
[01:08:51.134 --> 01:08:58.416]  But we're going to have a focused interview on a whole bunch of issues, Friday live on air.
[01:08:58.416 --> 01:09:04.937]  And again, I can't believe I have to even say this, but this is really Charlie Sheen.
[01:09:04.937 --> 01:09:10.478]  Yes, all these news articles in the LA Times and Fox News has now picked it up and Reuters and everywhere else.
[01:09:10.478 --> 01:09:12.579]  Yes, Charlie Sheen really wants to meet with the president.
[01:09:14.133 --> 01:09:22.360]  And the 20 Minutes of the President article he wrote is a vehicle to show people the research and information and make it interesting to read.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.361]  And it's just Charlie's idea.
[01:09:23.361 --> 01:09:28.726]  I mean, I think it's a great idea and a lot of even critics are saying it was very well written.
[01:09:28.726 --> 01:09:32.149]  And so it's his ballgame and I think he's done a great job.
[01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:36.113]  I mean, this is a guy who makes... I don't even want to tell you how much money he makes.
[01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:42.317]  And how good their family is, and how much they give to charity that nobody knows about.
[01:09:42.317 --> 01:09:47.741]  And like I said, how they pick up homeless people and give them rides.
[01:09:47.741 --> 01:09:53.266]  And I was talking to his driver, Charlie usually drives himself, but his driver was driving to the airport, and he goes, oh no, they constantly do it.
[01:09:53.266 --> 01:09:56.468]  They'll even get, you know, late going places, picking up people.
[01:09:56.468 --> 01:09:59.210]  I mean, they just, they're really good people.
[01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:04.815]  And when you actually know these people, and I know a lot of other Hollywood people who are really good people, and when you see in the media is a distortion.
[01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:07.330]  And he just has so much courage.
[01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:08.791]  I mean, this is not fun for him to do.
[01:10:08.791 --> 01:10:16.452]  He's doing it because he can't go on with his five children knowing that the government stages terror attacks.
[01:10:16.452 --> 01:10:18.813]  He can't go on not speaking out against it.
[01:10:18.813 --> 01:10:19.653]  He can't go on.
[01:10:19.653 --> 01:10:22.053]  It's not normal to just shut up.
[01:10:22.053 --> 01:10:31.015]  It's abnormal to read six of the ten 9-11 Commission members saying it's a fraud and a cover-up and a lie and that there should be criminal investigations of the Pentagon and the White House.
[01:10:31.015 --> 01:10:33.916]  Those are Commission members and the councils.
[01:10:33.916 --> 01:10:35.536]  That's linked in his 20 minutes with the President.
[01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:42.003]  I remember him saying, yeah, I'd like to, you know, write like a letter, like I'm talking to the President.
[01:10:42.003 --> 01:10:44.605]  Because he'd seen a story in the Washington Post.
[01:10:44.605 --> 01:10:45.586]  You'd ask him the name of that again.
[01:10:45.586 --> 01:10:48.148]  I've read it, but I forgot the title.
[01:10:48.148 --> 01:10:51.591]  Where it's like his dad interviewing the President, as if he's the President.
[01:10:51.591 --> 01:10:56.075]  And it was just interesting, and Charlie said, I think that's an interesting, novel way of doing this.
[01:10:56.075 --> 01:10:57.917]  And it's kind of the Hollywood view of something as well.
[01:10:57.917 --> 01:11:01.199]  And some of the Hollywood newspapers, you know, they picked up on that and understand it.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:05.282]  But that is not the whole event.
[01:11:05.282 --> 01:11:06.443]  That's a small part of it.
[01:11:06.443 --> 01:11:12.866]  It's the call to arms that you're going to hear in this video coming up and that you're going to hear live Friday.
[01:11:12.866 --> 01:11:14.507]  And then there's more coming up in the future.
[01:11:14.507 --> 01:11:15.467]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:11:15.467 --> 01:11:21.891]  I'm just going to leave it at that, okay?
[01:11:21.891 --> 01:11:25.593]  When I told you in the video Friday that it's going to be a succession of events.
[01:11:27.202 --> 01:11:29.103]  And people say, is this the biggest thing I've ever done?
[01:11:29.103 --> 01:11:29.724]  I think it is.
[01:11:29.724 --> 01:11:45.273]  Charlie writing this big letter to the President, saying he wants to meet with him in reality, saying he wants people to go out in the streets for 9-11 truth, and that we can't just allow this to be buried, or the government's going to stage more events, and having him on air.
[01:11:45.273 --> 01:11:46.453]  I mean, this is big, folks.
[01:11:46.453 --> 01:11:47.314]  This is big.
[01:11:47.314 --> 01:11:49.215]  This is blown up everywhere.
[01:11:49.215 --> 01:11:54.038]  This is huge, just like we told you it was, but it takes a day or two to really explode.
[01:11:57.062 --> 01:12:00.476]  And regardless of what you think of me, you gotta stand with Charlie Sheen and his amazing courage.
[01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:08.638]  Okay, let's go ahead and start the Charlie Sheen interview.
[01:12:08.638 --> 01:12:17.865]  You'll recognize the first minute and a half, it's what we've been playing the last day, the last 24 hours, but the other 20 minutes of it is Virgin, Maiden Voyage.
[01:12:17.865 --> 01:12:20.507]  And again, you just heard Charlie live last hour.
[01:12:20.507 --> 01:12:27.732]  It'll be retransmitting as we rebroadcast the show, where it ends in three hours and, well, two hours and 45 minutes, roughly.
[01:12:27.732 --> 01:12:29.373]  Two hours, 46 minutes, if we want to get technical.
[01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:36.554]  So let's go ahead and go to this interview with Charlie Sheen, demanding the truth.
[01:12:36.554 --> 01:12:37.835]  Charlie, it's great to be here with you.
[01:12:37.835 --> 01:12:39.955]  I appreciate you doing this interview.
[01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:40.635]  Likewise, Alex.
[01:12:40.635 --> 01:12:41.355]  Thank you.
[01:12:41.355 --> 01:12:46.116]  Why, after three years of silence concerning 9-11, are you now speaking up?
[01:12:46.116 --> 01:12:51.798]  And why have you written this public letter that you've now published?
[01:12:51.798 --> 01:12:52.618]  Well, Alex...
[01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:57.376]  I wrote this letter for two reasons.
[01:12:57.376 --> 01:13:03.925]  Firstly, I wanted to create a public document specifically rooted in fact.
[01:13:03.925 --> 01:13:11.374]  If anybody dares question that, I would encourage those people to scrutinize it, to research it.
[01:13:13.096 --> 01:13:16.819]  The truth is unchanging, Alex, as we both know.
[01:13:16.819 --> 01:13:22.282]  The only aspect of this piece that had to be manufactured were the president's words.
[01:13:22.282 --> 01:13:28.687]  Everything else will withstand the critical assault I'm more than prepared to endure.
[01:13:28.687 --> 01:13:36.712]  And secondly, this is our first new president since 9-11, and consequently his first 9-11 anniversary in office.
[01:13:38.763 --> 01:13:39.864]  Enough stonewalling.
[01:13:39.864 --> 01:13:42.145]  Enough media manipulation.
[01:13:42.145 --> 01:13:45.207]  Enough media mantra speak.
[01:13:45.207 --> 01:13:47.428]  The families deserve better, Alex.
[01:13:47.428 --> 01:13:49.329]  America deserves better.
[01:13:49.329 --> 01:13:50.670]  I mean, come on.
[01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:51.511]  Come on, people.
[01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:56.434]  The 9-11 Commission report is a blatant work of manipulation, secrecy, and fiction.
[01:13:57.443 --> 01:13:59.264]  Come on, the time is now.
[01:13:59.264 --> 01:14:01.626]  Demand the truth.
[01:14:01.626 --> 01:14:10.472]  I personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a new investigation is just gonna fall out of the heavens right into our Congress.
[01:14:10.472 --> 01:14:12.013]  We have to take action.
[01:14:12.013 --> 01:14:12.993]  We have to stand as one.
[01:14:12.993 --> 01:14:16.676]  We must insist that our new president deliver on his promises.
[01:14:16.676 --> 01:14:19.678]  And that's why, Alex, that's why I've gone right to the top with this.
[01:14:19.678 --> 01:14:24.441]  That's why I'm asking the president to read my letter, to answer my questions in person.
[01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:44.352]  Charlie, I noticed that in your letter to the President, you make the point that several members of the 9-11 Commission, including the Chairman, have said that the Pentagon lied to them, that there were a lot of distortions involved.
[01:14:44.352 --> 01:14:50.855]  And the Chief Counsel, Mr. Farmer, is now writing a tell-all book and has been interviewed by the Washington Post.
[01:14:50.855 --> 01:14:54.497]  He's out there saying that they met secretly with the Pentagon.
[01:14:54.497 --> 01:14:54.777]  I don't
[01:15:10.086 --> 01:15:13.308]  So this isn't about Charlie Sheen or Alex Jones.
[01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:16.189]  It's about Barack Obama because he's the new president.
[01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.709]  He's in there.
[01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:17.690]  George Bush is gone.
[01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:19.551]  That was like talking to a brick wall.
[01:15:19.551 --> 01:15:21.371]  And we've got to have a real investigation.
[01:15:21.371 --> 01:15:22.872]  We haven't had a real investigation yet.
[01:15:22.872 --> 01:15:29.715]  We've got all these blacked out pages in the first report, 900 pages, a bunch of pages in the 9-11 Commission report are blacked out.
[01:15:29.715 --> 01:15:32.897]  I mean, I know I'm ranting here, but what do you say to that?
[01:15:32.897 --> 01:15:33.777]  Because it's in your letter.
[01:15:33.777 --> 01:15:37.359]  I mean, you're only pointing out that the Commission itself says it's a fraud.
[01:15:38.482 --> 01:15:43.105]  Well, I had faith that as time went on, that more would be revealed.
[01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:48.129]  Month after month, year after year, more has continually been revealed.
[01:15:48.129 --> 01:15:55.374]  And as you have stated, these are the questions, these are the facts, these are the issues that found their way into my letter.
[01:15:55.374 --> 01:16:08.224]  Because, as I said, not as a challenge, just to not be misrepresented, just to not be demonized for asking questions, when in fact all we're doing is what we have been taught.
[01:16:08.804 --> 01:16:16.448]  Is our God-given right as Americans to question something that we know to be, let's just say, suspicious?
[01:16:27.261 --> 01:16:27.321]  Yes.
[01:16:46.494 --> 01:16:46.874]  I don't know.
[01:17:05.127 --> 01:17:09.551]  What's your take on the fact that they're probably going to come out and say, how dare you ask these questions?
[01:17:09.551 --> 01:17:27.428]  Alex, I actually addressed that in my open letter in 20 Minutes with the President, where I discussed that the message we carry, and by we, myself, America, and most importantly, the victim family members, where I do discuss
[01:17:29.109 --> 01:17:45.235]  This message will not be silenced anymore by the media fueled mantras Insisting how they feel and deciding for them for eight long years What can be thought what can be said what can be asked even during the 9-11 Commission?
[01:17:45.235 --> 01:17:47.256]  The audience was filled with family members screaming.
[01:17:47.256 --> 01:17:53.118]  It was a fraud in the line You know they've been all over the news saying they want a new investigation.
[01:17:53.118 --> 01:17:54.078]  How dare the media?
[01:17:58.104 --> 01:18:15.974]  I mean come on Alex it was all over the news during the 9-11 Commission investigation that the family members were deeply frustrated and the questions that they needed to have asked never saw the light of day never found those words never found their way onto the page into that report
[01:18:16.474 --> 01:18:26.719]  And so we're not just assuming or believing that because we're told that it's offensive to the families to question all of this.
[01:18:26.719 --> 01:18:29.560]  We know for a fact that this is not the case.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.161]  We know that they've been calling for a new investigation.
[01:18:32.161 --> 01:18:33.642]  They've been demanding the truth.
[01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:42.946]  They've been looking beyond what they've been force-fed and told was the correct way to behave about their murdered family members.
[01:18:42.946 --> 01:18:44.467]  Charlie, what about all the experts?
[01:18:45.879 --> 01:18:46.099]  What is it?
[01:19:03.158 --> 01:19:07.480]  Other celebrities coming out too, like William Nelson and Governor Jesse Mantoura.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:12.141]  What has it been like the last three years watching all of this unfold?
[01:19:12.141 --> 01:19:13.242]  It's exciting, Alex.
[01:19:13.242 --> 01:19:13.882]  It's encouraging.
[01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.003]  It gives me hope.
[01:19:15.003 --> 01:19:29.208]  But rather than categorizing the different groups in the movement as the architectural group, the scientific group, I think it's important that we all just view ourselves as people of logic.
[01:19:30.552 --> 01:19:41.819]  What they're asking us to do, essentially what they're asking us to do, is they're asking us to completely suspend everything we have learned and know to be true for our entire lives.
[01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:56.049]  And they are asking us, on one specific day, to take all of that knowledge, all of that experience, all of that truth, stand it on its ear, throw it out the window, and worship a new form of physics.
[01:19:56.049 --> 01:19:57.610]  Worship a new form of reality.
[01:19:57.610 --> 01:19:58.530]  Alright!
[01:19:58.530 --> 01:19:59.351]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:02.222]  We're good.
[01:20:17.429 --> 01:20:28.578]  You will receive seeds to grow tomatoes, carrots, beans, broccoli, cucumbers, peppers, onions, cabbage, lettuce, pumpkins, spinach, peas, wheatgrass, and much more.
[01:20:28.578 --> 01:20:29.639]  And the best part?
[01:20:29.639 --> 01:20:34.843]  You will receive almost 6,000 seeds that you can save and replant each season for only $79.
[01:20:34.843 --> 01:20:40.667]  This means that these vegetables will only cost you about one penny for each one you grow.
[01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:45.691]  And in this economy, saving money is always welcome, especially when it comes to our food supply.
[01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:49.677]  Order now and these seeds will be shipped to you absolutely free.

[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:07.466]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.466 --> 01:21:13.352]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.352 --> 01:21:19.498]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:19.838 --> 01:21:21.819]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:21.819 --> 01:21:24.280]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:37.465]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:21:37.465 --> 01:21:39.126]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.126 --> 01:21:40.986]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:40.986 --> 01:21:47.229]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:47.890 --> 01:21:56.157]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:56.157 --> 01:21:57.739]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.739 --> 01:21:58.940]  The people strike back!
[01:22:00.754 --> 01:22:02.935]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[01:22:02.935 --> 01:22:03.776]  Spy on me?
[01:22:03.776 --> 01:22:04.096]  Yeah.
[01:22:04.096 --> 01:22:09.159]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[01:22:09.159 --> 01:22:10.779]  You should use Startpage instead.
[01:22:10.779 --> 01:22:11.540]  Startpage?
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:13.041]  Yeah, Startpage.com.
[01:22:13.041 --> 01:22:15.922]  The new name for Ixquick, the world's most private search engine.
[01:22:15.922 --> 01:22:19.744]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[01:22:19.744 --> 01:22:22.846]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[01:22:22.846 --> 01:22:25.387]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[01:22:25.387 --> 01:22:27.008]  I'm adding Startpage to my browser.
[01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:27.308]  Right.
[01:22:27.308 --> 01:22:30.290]  Go to Startpage.com and start searching with privacy.
[01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:33.012]  This is Privacy Expert Dr. Kathryn Albrecht.
[01:22:33.012 --> 01:22:37.876]  We're all creatures of habit, but there are some habits you need to break if you want to hang on to your privacy.
[01:22:37.876 --> 01:22:41.399]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the 1 Week Start Page Challenge.
[01:22:41.399 --> 01:22:47.143]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[01:22:47.143 --> 01:22:51.426]  Try 7 days on StartPage and break the Big Brother habit, just like I did.
[01:22:51.426 --> 01:22:53.588]  I switched to StartPage and never looked back.
[01:22:53.588 --> 01:22:55.770]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[01:22:55.770 --> 01:23:00.013]  Try StartPage.com for 7 days and start protecting your privacy.
[01:23:00.819 --> 01:23:05.969]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[01:23:05.969 --> 01:23:11.639]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[01:23:11.639 --> 01:23:13.022]  The answer is simple.
[01:23:13.022 --> 01:23:13.583]  Pure bulk.
[01:23:15.489 --> 01:23:15.869]  We're good to go!
[01:23:45.981 --> 01:23:46.301]  We're good.
[01:24:10.182 --> 01:24:16.577]  We're continuing with this historic interview with Charlie Sheen as he breaks his silence about 9-11.
[01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:23.834]  We've got a special call-to-action video coming up tomorrow and then Friday, Charlie Sheen live on the show.
[01:24:23.834 --> 01:24:32.401]  For those who just tuned in, he was live for about 8-9 minutes, if you time it out with us, at the bottom of the hour.
[01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:37.325]  So 30 minutes into the show, definitely want to tune in for that on the retransmissions if you missed it.
[01:24:37.325 --> 01:24:38.506]  Making big national news.
[01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:43.249]  Let's continue and we'll go out to break with this and then come back and finish up the interview after the break.
[01:24:43.249 --> 01:24:43.690]  Stay with us.
[01:24:45.891 --> 01:24:57.162]  What they're asking us to do, essentially what they're asking us to do, is they're asking us to completely suspend everything we have learned and know to be true for our entire lives.
[01:24:57.162 --> 01:25:06.711]  And they are asking us, on one specific day, to take all of that knowledge, all of that experience, all of that truth, stand it on its ear, throw it out the window, and
[01:25:08.913 --> 01:25:11.355]  Worship a new form of physics.
[01:25:11.355 --> 01:25:20.302]  Worship a new form of reality that is completely inconsistent with everything we know in each and every cell of our entire being.
[01:25:20.302 --> 01:25:24.886]  And it's important to know, Alex, that we're not just asked, we are told to believe these things.
[01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:27.188]  And then we are demonized for questioning them.
[01:25:27.768 --> 01:25:31.231]  As a free human being, as a free American, you're supposed to be able to question the government.
[01:25:31.231 --> 01:25:36.776]  And you've got a building, a 747-story building with a CIA headquartered in it, falls at free-fall speed.
[01:25:36.776 --> 01:25:39.638]  NIST has now admitted that after denying it for years.
[01:25:39.638 --> 01:25:47.365]  And then we're demonized for asking questions when the 9-11 Commission itself and their Chief Counsel is saying it's a fraud, is writing a tell-all book.
[01:25:47.365 --> 01:25:51.008]  I see this whole cover-up collapsing, just like those buildings did when they blew them sky-high.
[01:25:51.428 --> 01:26:06.691]  Well, Alex, all we can do, all we can do is continue to ask the questions, continue to apply the pressure, continue to insist that no, this is not good enough, we are better than this, we deserve better than this, and we will not settle for anything shy of that.
[01:26:07.051 --> 01:26:08.411]  That's the big question, Charlie.
[01:26:08.411 --> 01:26:09.652]  Why are you doing this?
[01:26:09.652 --> 01:26:11.232]  Why did you do it three years ago?
[01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:12.032]  Why now today?
[01:26:12.032 --> 01:26:16.593]  What is it that drives you that makes you different from a lot of big Hollywood stars?
[01:26:16.593 --> 01:26:19.674]  I mean, you're, you know, super A-list, top of your game.
[01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:26.936]  And why are you focused on these issues when so many other people, you know, at your level are, you know, worried about their skin cream?
[01:26:27.788 --> 01:26:33.551]  Alex, for 26 years, more than half of my life, I have been creating fiction for a living.
[01:26:33.551 --> 01:26:41.975]  So believe me when I tell you, I recognize it when it presents itself, and even more so when it is forced into my grill.
[01:26:41.975 --> 01:26:53.781]  So, on that note, Alex, I'm no longer afraid to say that the official 9-11 story is an absolute fairy tale, a complete work of fiction, and not even a very good one.
[01:26:54.381 --> 01:26:57.084]  Well, your letter makes perfect sense on that point.
[01:26:57.084 --> 01:26:58.585]  This thing is a work of fiction.
[01:26:58.585 --> 01:26:59.726]  They admit it's a fraud.
[01:26:59.726 --> 01:27:01.688]  It's been proven to be a lie from end to end.
[01:27:01.688 --> 01:27:04.731]  But we don't know exactly what happened that day.
[01:27:04.731 --> 01:27:06.753]  Hence, we do need to have a new investigation.
[01:27:06.753 --> 01:27:12.299]  Are you confident that Congress could engage in a free and open impartial investigation?
[01:27:13.139 --> 01:27:17.862]  Well, of course, Alex.
[01:27:17.862 --> 01:27:28.730]  Nothing's perfect, but in view of the evidence that continues to reveal itself, a new and open investigation is certainly a step in the right direction.
[01:27:43.263 --> 01:27:54.246]  They spin it into this notion, this idea that we have cracked the case, we have the answers, we've figured this thing out.
[01:27:54.246 --> 01:27:54.906]  No, no, no.
[01:27:54.906 --> 01:27:56.486]  That's not what we're doing here.
[01:27:56.486 --> 01:28:03.548]  All we're really saying is that what we've been told to believe, we must reject.
[01:28:04.608 --> 01:28:05.428]  On face value.
[01:28:05.428 --> 01:28:06.929]  We must reject it.
[01:28:06.929 --> 01:28:11.930]  And therefore, that is the foundation of the questions that so many of us have.
[01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:13.050]  That so many of us share.
[01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:15.791]  Because it's not about having the answers.
[01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:17.771]  We know their stories are fraud, Alex.
[01:28:17.771 --> 01:28:19.492]  We are looking for the truth.
[01:28:19.492 --> 01:28:21.512]  Let's just talk about this for one second, Alex.
[01:28:21.512 --> 01:28:24.513]  And this has really bothered me from day one.
[01:28:24.513 --> 01:28:24.993]  How is it
[01:28:25.831 --> 01:28:32.956]  That two completely random events result in an identical occurrence.
[01:28:32.956 --> 01:28:35.598]  You're talking about the collapse of the North and South Tower.
[01:28:35.598 --> 01:28:43.663]  I ask you again, Alex, how is it that two completely random events result in an identical occurrence?
[01:28:43.663 --> 01:28:49.227]  Two different types of jetliners, different fuel, different places, but the buildings collapse the same way.
[01:28:49.227 --> 01:28:50.007]  But what about Building 7?
[01:28:50.007 --> 01:28:51.588]  It's not hit by a plane.
[01:28:51.588 --> 01:28:55.131]  And then now they've got all that thermite and thermate reports and peer-reviewed journals and...
[01:28:55.951 --> 01:29:00.575]  And then all these videos of police and firemen saying the government told them to get back, Building 7 was to come down?
[01:29:00.575 --> 01:29:05.800]  I think we should treat Building 7 exactly as the 9-11 Commission report did, and completely ignore it.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.400]  Because guess what?
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:09.783]  When you completely ignore something, it magically disappears.
[01:29:09.783 --> 01:29:11.525]  Isn't that what we've been taught to believe?
[01:29:11.525 --> 01:29:12.626]  Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:29:15.025 --> 01:29:31.871]  Hey, I talked to the public, and a lot of them didn't even know there was a 47-story building way off from the main towers that wasn't hit by a plane, had a few windows knocked out, and had the CIA based in it, and then it collapses in on itself, and then there's all these CNN videos of police and firemen saying, get back, they're going to bring the building down.
[01:29:31.871 --> 01:29:41.235]  We've got Jane Stanley, the reporter for BBC World, and then simultaneously on BBC 24, the other reporters, 25 minutes before Building 7 collapses after 5 p.m.
[01:29:41.235 --> 01:29:41.815]  in the afternoon.
[01:29:42.535 --> 01:29:49.004]  They get on the news and say Building 7 has collapsed into its own footprint symmetrically, and right out the window is Building 7.
[01:29:49.004 --> 01:29:52.689]  And then the BBC for years... We're on the march.
[01:29:52.689 --> 01:29:55.233]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.233 --> 01:29:57.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.529 --> 01:30:05.856]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:05.856 --> 01:30:07.919]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:30:07.919 --> 01:30:10.382]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:10.382 --> 01:30:12.645]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:30:12.645 --> 01:30:14.267]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:30:14.267 --> 01:30:15.309]  There is a solution.
[01:30:15.529 --> 01:30:23.972]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:30:23.972 --> 01:30:31.415]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:30:37.457 --> 01:30:43.039]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:31:00.452 --> 01:31:04.696]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:31:04.696 --> 01:31:06.698]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:31:06.698 --> 01:31:15.227]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:31:15.227 --> 01:31:20.772]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:31:20.772 --> 01:31:22.394]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:31:22.634 --> 01:31:29.156]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:31:29.156 --> 01:31:40.198]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:31:40.198 --> 01:31:40.959]  That's right.
[01:31:40.959 --> 01:31:43.539]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:31:43.539 --> 01:31:45.120]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:47.681]  We're good to go.
[01:32:00.836 --> 01:32:03.118]  ...rings and the questions are asked.
[01:32:03.118 --> 01:32:04.379]  I've been so sick!
[01:32:04.379 --> 01:32:06.080]  Will the LifeChange Tea help me?
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:07.921]  Our answer is always the same.
[01:32:07.921 --> 01:32:14.046]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water, and air are attacking you this very moment.
[01:32:14.046 --> 01:32:19.950]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:24.454]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[01:32:24.454 --> 01:32:25.875]  We use results.
[01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:29.737]  LifeChange Tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[01:32:30.598 --> 01:32:35.219]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[01:32:35.219 --> 01:32:39.080]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:42.981]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[01:32:42.981 --> 01:32:47.923]  Our number is 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[01:32:47.923 --> 01:32:50.944]  Again, that's 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[01:32:50.944 --> 01:32:54.685]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[01:32:54.685 --> 01:32:57.225]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[01:32:57.225 --> 01:32:59.846]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[01:33:12.947 --> 01:33:17.051]  Well, it's amazing.
[01:33:17.051 --> 01:33:24.337]  Fox News, Reuters, AP, E!
[01:33:24.337 --> 01:33:28.520]  Entertainment, Houston Chronicle, LA Times.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:34.245]  Massive coverage of Charlie Sheen and his request to have a meeting with President Obama.
[01:33:36.092 --> 01:33:51.037]  Again, to make this event about Obama and how Obama has done nothing, that was Charlie's main reason for writing it as a mock letter with a disclosure at the end, was to make it about Barack Obama and 9-11, to put it into his court.
[01:33:51.037 --> 01:33:57.320]  But the bigger announcement is he wants the American people to take action and to stand up and demand the truth.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.241]  We plan a special video tomorrow.
[01:34:00.241 --> 01:34:03.602]  And then Charlie Sheen for an extended live interview on Friday.
[01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:17.275]  We have Richard Gage coming up for 30 minutes in the next hour to talk about the hit piece that was put out on National Geographic Channel against 9-11 Truth.
[01:34:17.275 --> 01:34:18.816]  Just completely shoddy.
[01:34:18.816 --> 01:34:20.336]  And then we'll take calls for 30 minutes.
[01:34:20.336 --> 01:34:24.558]  Then we've got, for 30 minutes, Professor Stephen Jones coming on, who was also in the hit piece.
[01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:28.040]  I remember telling Gage it was going to be a hit piece.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.521]  He's like, oh no, they're listening to all my facts and looking at all my evidence.
[01:34:30.521 --> 01:34:32.501]  I said, they won't put it in there.
[01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:33.782]  Because I knew the production company.
[01:34:35.834 --> 01:34:38.356]  Creative differences.
[01:34:38.356 --> 01:34:42.018]  I've refused repeatedly to be interviewed by them.
[01:34:42.018 --> 01:34:50.984]  They're the guys that have made repeated JFK hit pieces, making fun of those 90 plus percent in major polls that believe the government killed Kennedy.
[01:34:50.984 --> 01:34:55.266]  Of course, 80-something percent used to say the government staged Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:34:55.266 --> 01:34:56.547]  Now it's declassified and admitted.
[01:34:56.547 --> 01:35:02.231]  So we're going to be talking about all of that today, but really,
[01:35:03.683 --> 01:35:20.585]  Charlie Sheen exposing 9-11 truth is big and it's important, but I had no idea this week that the government would launch part two and the media would launch part two of its announcement and its conditioning of the public that the only way the dollar is going to be saved
[01:35:22.992 --> 01:35:23.152]  Is it?
[01:35:42.688 --> 01:35:44.729]  America will collapse and be like Argentina.
[01:35:44.729 --> 01:35:46.450]  There'll be millions of people homeless.
[01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:49.431]  The dollar will become worthless overnight or near worthless.
[01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:51.592]  Unless we have a new bank of the world.
[01:35:51.592 --> 01:35:55.113]  Give the bankers that engineered the collapse total power and control.
[01:35:55.113 --> 01:35:58.435]  Of course, they don't mention that they engineered it.
[01:35:58.435 --> 01:36:00.115]  That is now all over the news.
[01:36:00.115 --> 01:36:04.057]  I have a stack of it here and I'm going to cover that some today as well at the end of the show.
[01:36:06.687 --> 01:36:13.170]  You see, we talk about how they're going to implode the economy and implode the dollar and bring in a world government set up for and by the banks.
[01:36:13.170 --> 01:36:16.092]  Off their own documents for 14 years, people make fun of us.
[01:36:16.092 --> 01:36:16.992]  Now it's all happening.
[01:36:16.992 --> 01:36:18.633]  See, it's not about Alex Jones.
[01:36:18.633 --> 01:36:20.994]  It's about the documents and the evidence and the history.
[01:36:22.247 --> 01:36:29.310]  The open announcement of the Pentagon that they want 4,000 troops, and then 20,000 troops, then 40,000 troops, and now 400,000 troops!
[01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:33.012]  Openly in Congress saying we want to occupy every city with military.
[01:36:33.012 --> 01:36:42.676]  And, oh, we're getting ready for mass quarantines and roundups and arrests, and I don't know if that's going to happen, but they're certainly testing the water, sending up a trial balloon.
[01:36:42.676 --> 01:36:46.698]  It's all going on right now, and I'm telling you they're going to stage terror attacks.
[01:36:46.698 --> 01:36:48.278]  Even Michael Savage agrees.
[01:36:48.278 --> 01:36:49.999]  Even Glenn Beck has said they may stage something.
[01:36:53.311 --> 01:36:56.133]  Even Dick Morris gets up on TV and says, yeah, it's a new world order.
[01:36:56.133 --> 01:36:57.694]  World government taking over.
[01:36:57.694 --> 01:36:58.475]  New world currency.
[01:36:58.475 --> 01:36:59.215]  It's true.
[01:36:59.215 --> 01:37:00.857]  The conspiracy theorists were right.
[01:37:00.857 --> 01:37:03.659]  And Hannity's just turning red while he's saying it.
[01:37:04.938 --> 01:37:24.644]  Look, folks, the globalists are experts at getting us to fight with each other over Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Muslim, black, white, young, old, cop versus citizen, citizen versus cop, and I've fallen into some of that, bashing police, because they have been trained to be out of control in many areas and done a lot of bad things, but there's also a lot of good police that give us a lot of good info.
[01:37:24.644 --> 01:37:26.884]  I run into a lot of them across the country.
[01:37:26.884 --> 01:37:32.426]  When I had the 9-11 truth meeting with 1,200 people that C-SPAN taped and aired out in L.A.,
[01:37:33.493 --> 01:37:45.444]  There were several big Hollywood stars there, and I was talking to the off-duty, in one case and retired in another, LAPD detectives, who were their bodyguards.
[01:37:45.444 --> 01:37:58.455]  That's the best bodyguards, they say, because it's not just some Rambo guy, it's somebody that knows investigations, knows how to assess people, and they're like, look, everybody who was in the detective squad when 9-11 happened knew it was an inside job.
[01:37:58.455 --> 01:37:59.296]  Give us a break.
[01:37:59.296 --> 01:38:00.397]  We know what we're looking at.
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:07.062]  Anybody who's got any instincts or any brain knows!
[01:38:07.062 --> 01:38:09.463]  And I understand it's scary to know the truth and face it.
[01:38:09.463 --> 01:38:11.144]  You think I like it?
[01:38:11.144 --> 01:38:16.126]  You think I like going on air?
[01:38:16.126 --> 01:38:18.787]  Endangering my family, my name, everything?
[01:38:18.787 --> 01:38:21.348]  You think I like being beat up in a parking lot?
[01:38:21.348 --> 01:38:23.409]  You think I like death threats to my wife, my children?
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:37.388]  But I'm in this, past the point of no return, and if more people would just stand up who know the truth, we could take this country and this world back, because if we take the tool of false flag terror away from these people, it's over.
[01:38:37.388 --> 01:38:41.231]  It's over.
[01:38:41.231 --> 01:38:46.375]  So the establishment is going to try to spin the Sheen report and say, how dare you write a mock letter
[01:38:48.499 --> 01:38:54.043]  And then Murphy's Law falling into their hands of, you know, the disclaimer and some of the other links at the bottom.
[01:38:54.043 --> 01:38:56.405]  Well, the links themselves weren't there at first, too.
[01:38:56.405 --> 01:38:58.286]  Just all the dozens of links didn't show up.
[01:38:58.286 --> 01:39:01.369]  It's weird how WordPress works, you know, trying to divert off into that.
[01:39:01.369 --> 01:39:12.537]  The point is, we're up on the eighth year anniversary of these staged events, and it's bigger than Bush, it's bigger than Clinton, it's bigger than Barack Obama.
[01:39:12.537 --> 01:39:14.198]  We make that point in the Obama deception.
[01:39:14.198 --> 01:39:15.139]  Look at the Obama deception.
[01:39:17.466 --> 01:39:20.768]  Months and months, what, two, three months into its release, it was over 15 million views.
[01:39:20.768 --> 01:39:28.491]  I could count up on Google and YouTube and other channels that had counters, and that was spent in 30, 40 minutes just going through sites, counting them up with a calculator.
[01:39:28.491 --> 01:39:32.373]  I did it a couple months later, it was 20 million, and I didn't have time to go count up all the sites.
[01:39:32.373 --> 01:39:41.237]  There's thousands of places that you can find right now where it's posted with a million views, a half million views, three and a half million views, two million views, 600,000 views, 900,000 views, 10,000 views, 40,000 views.
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:48.643]  20 plus million and I haven't counted it up in months.
[01:39:48.643 --> 01:39:51.947]  I'm just a regular guy who made that film in three months.
[01:39:51.947 --> 01:39:54.650]  I did two months of research and put it together in a month.
[01:39:54.650 --> 01:39:58.214]  I'm making Fall the Republic right now.
[01:39:58.214 --> 01:39:59.375]  And I've got a big announcement on that.
[01:39:59.375 --> 01:40:04.901]  It is coming out October 1st.
[01:40:04.901 --> 01:40:06.223]  I'll just make that big announcement later.
[01:40:11.397 --> 01:40:21.161]  The point is, look at Luke Hradowski, a 19-year-old young man who got involved and wanted to make the 9-11 Truth Movement about the New World Order and about who pulled the strings of the President.
[01:40:21.161 --> 01:40:24.022]  He wanted to make it about something bigger than Bush.
[01:40:24.022 --> 01:40:25.643]  He wanted to march to David Rockefeller's house.
[01:40:25.643 --> 01:40:27.223]  He wanted to march to the UN.
[01:40:27.223 --> 01:40:30.525]  And 9-11 Truth New York, I'm not saying they're bad folks, but they basically kicked him out of it.
[01:40:30.525 --> 01:40:32.285]  And he said, fine, I'm going to start my own group.
[01:40:32.285 --> 01:40:34.967]  Because I remember talking to him, and he was all bummed out, and I barely knew him.
[01:40:34.967 --> 01:40:37.588]  Only met him once.
[01:40:37.588 --> 01:40:40.849]  And I said, Luke, I said,
[01:40:42.381 --> 01:40:43.381]  You gotta go start your own group.
[01:40:43.381 --> 01:40:44.341]  And he said, well, I'm just a kid.
[01:40:44.341 --> 01:40:45.822]  And I said, no, you're not.
[01:40:45.822 --> 01:40:47.262]  People already see you as a leader.
[01:40:47.262 --> 01:40:49.863]  That's why you've been kicked out of this other group.
[01:40:49.863 --> 01:40:51.143]  Because it becomes like a turf thing.
[01:40:51.143 --> 01:40:53.063]  I said, go out and start your own group.
[01:40:53.063 --> 01:40:55.884]  And he, a couple days later, called me and said, what about We Are Change?
[01:40:55.884 --> 01:40:57.244]  I said, yeah, isn't that from Gandhi?
[01:40:57.244 --> 01:40:58.644]  Yeah, be the change you want to see in the world.
[01:40:58.644 --> 01:41:00.225]  And I said, that's great.
[01:41:00.225 --> 01:41:04.886]  This is three years ago.
[01:41:04.886 --> 01:41:06.446]  Long before Obama was using that term.
[01:41:07.691 --> 01:41:09.152]  And the establishment's scared of it, folks.
[01:41:09.152 --> 01:41:21.656]  They've run PSYOPs, or they have people connected to the Bush administration, at events where We Are Change is demonstrating outside, just run up out of an alley with a girl in a wheelchair, running it into German talus.
[01:41:21.656 --> 01:41:26.618]  And when it finally got to court, he wouldn't plead bargain.
[01:41:26.618 --> 01:41:31.500]  Suddenly, the police changed their story and said, okay, we didn't see him hit her.
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:36.982]  And they literally put the handicapped girl in a Girl Scout outfit with a puppy in her arms, up on the stand.
[01:41:38.723 --> 01:41:40.164]  Stuffed puppy.
[01:41:40.164 --> 01:41:43.385]  Playing the part of a little victim and her testimony fell apart.
[01:41:43.385 --> 01:41:46.426]  And then they got the Secret Service up there and the Secret Service said this isn't true.
[01:41:46.426 --> 01:41:52.868]  Because that Secret Service agent wasn't going to lie about somebody and on top of it, blow their whole career when it came out.
[01:41:52.868 --> 01:41:55.809]  But I mean, it was in the New York Post, they had to do a retraction everywhere.
[01:41:55.809 --> 01:41:59.471]  That 9-11 truthers were jumping out of alleys attacking people in wheelchairs.
[01:41:59.471 --> 01:42:04.073]  Folks, have you seen news headlines someday that, you know, that I've attacked a young girl in a wheelchair?
[01:42:04.073 --> 01:42:04.893]  It isn't true!
[01:42:06.561 --> 01:42:08.562]  But that's what the PSYOP people think about.
[01:42:08.562 --> 01:42:09.402]  They go, what'll work?
[01:42:09.402 --> 01:42:12.463]  How do we make us the victims?
[01:42:12.463 --> 01:42:15.003]  We don't like these guys protesting Laura Bush.
[01:42:15.003 --> 01:42:16.684]  They're going to every event.
[01:42:16.684 --> 01:42:19.745]  Giuliani's intelligence is following them.
[01:42:19.745 --> 01:42:21.245]  Bloomberg's intelligence is following.
[01:42:21.245 --> 01:42:24.306]  Cops are coming up, off-duty cops, retired cops, cops in uniform.
[01:42:24.306 --> 01:42:26.126]  We're going to plant bombs on you and guns.
[01:42:26.126 --> 01:42:33.508]  We know you're not terrorists, but you'll be in 30 days in the hole before we can sort that out and laugh like gangsters.
[01:42:33.508 --> 01:42:35.149]  That's what 9-11 Truth is facing.
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:40.928]  This is a absolute in-the-trenches fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:40.928 --> 01:42:42.450]  My life wouldn't be worth ten cents.
[01:42:42.450 --> 01:42:43.352]  They'd love to kill me.
[01:42:45.438 --> 01:42:50.623]  But they don't want to underline and highlight everything I've said, everything I've done, and make me a martyr.
[01:42:50.623 --> 01:42:53.205]  And believe me, that would water the tree of liberty.
[01:42:53.205 --> 01:42:54.186]  But I don't want it to happen.
[01:42:54.186 --> 01:42:55.047]  I enjoy my life.
[01:42:55.047 --> 01:42:56.428]  I enjoy my children.
[01:42:56.428 --> 01:42:57.629]  I enjoy looking at the stars.
[01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:58.690]  I enjoy fishing.
[01:42:58.690 --> 01:42:59.831]  I enjoy swimming.
[01:42:59.831 --> 01:43:00.611]  I enjoy camping.
[01:43:00.611 --> 01:43:01.672]  I enjoy jogging.
[01:43:01.672 --> 01:43:03.114]  I enjoy kissing my wife.
[01:43:03.114 --> 01:43:06.036]  I enjoy visiting my grandmother, who's 85 years old.
[01:43:14.289 --> 01:43:17.791]  But there's no future if we don't stand up to these people.
[01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:28.155]  And that's why the system hates me so much, and all their COINTELPRO hates me so much, and all these other jealous people hate me, even because they're not government, because I'm up on the pedestal.
[01:43:28.155 --> 01:43:30.776]  Everybody says I'm the leader of the anti-new-war movement.
[01:43:30.776 --> 01:43:33.158]  Worldwide, I'm now being recognized as that.
[01:43:33.158 --> 01:43:34.058]  And I'm not perfect.
[01:43:34.058 --> 01:43:36.219]  I've said over and over again, folks, I'm not up to the job.
[01:43:37.534 --> 01:43:39.434]  You know who carries the trash out a lot of times here?
[01:43:39.434 --> 01:43:42.515]  If it hadn't been done in a couple days and I see fruit flies flying around?
[01:43:42.515 --> 01:43:43.215]  Me.
[01:43:43.215 --> 01:43:44.696]  You know who puts light bulbs in?
[01:43:44.696 --> 01:43:46.836]  Me.
[01:43:46.836 --> 01:43:49.437]  Then I scrunch around trying to get the money just to finance this place.
[01:43:49.437 --> 01:43:50.317]  Then I get paranoid.
[01:43:50.317 --> 01:43:51.778]  I want to hire new people.
[01:43:51.778 --> 01:43:52.998]  So we get infiltrated.
[01:43:52.998 --> 01:43:57.359]  Man, my life's a spy movie, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:57.359 --> 01:43:58.479]  And I'm not a spy.
[01:43:58.479 --> 01:43:58.839]  I'm not.
[01:43:58.839 --> 01:44:00.100]  I wasn't trained to do this.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:00.860]  I'm just a guy from
[01:44:01.991 --> 01:44:04.732]  The suburbs of Dallas, Texas who found out about the U.N.
[01:44:04.732 --> 01:44:06.693]  and gun control and the New World Order.
[01:44:06.693 --> 01:44:09.214]  And I'm concerned and I'm upset.
[01:44:09.214 --> 01:44:12.675]  And I went and got an AXS TV show and I got a radio show and I got a syndicated radio show.
[01:44:12.675 --> 01:44:16.017]  I fell into it just like Lucas falling into it.
[01:44:16.017 --> 01:44:20.379]  And now I'm here at this point with everything I do, everything I say being analyzed.
[01:44:20.379 --> 01:44:24.660]  I got all these emails and saw this website going, Alex Jones the liar.
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:28.602]  Lies and says Terror Storm is his newest movie and GCN at.
[01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:33.989]  All because GCN put in some of my old ads in rotation.
[01:44:33.989 --> 01:44:38.450]  So I told them to put the endgame one back in.
[01:44:38.450 --> 01:44:40.151]  They put the others back in, which is fine.
[01:44:40.151 --> 01:44:41.852]  I mean, that gets nitpicked.
[01:44:41.852 --> 01:44:44.613]  Oh, look, a three-year-old ad says my newest film.
[01:44:44.613 --> 01:44:45.893]  It's a three-year-old ad I cut three years ago.
[01:44:45.893 --> 01:44:48.394]  I don't have the time to go cut a new one.
[01:44:48.394 --> 01:44:54.056]  It's just like, I've got to be spotless up on this white horse, perfect.
[01:44:54.056 --> 01:44:56.537]  Literally, when I go to the bathroom, flowers come out.
[01:44:56.537 --> 01:44:58.998]  No, that's not what happens when I go to the bathroom, folks.
[01:45:02.602 --> 01:45:14.972]  You know, I get cavities, and broken teeth, and I get hangnails, and I get headaches, and I get floods in my house, and I get... I walk out in the backyard and step in dog crap.
[01:45:14.972 --> 01:45:18.035]  I'm just like everybody else, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:18.035 --> 01:45:24.140]  I get sick kids after I've already been up till 1, 2 in the morning, and I'm taking care of sick kids at 3, 4 a.m.
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:26.382]  I'm just like everybody else.
[01:45:26.382 --> 01:45:31.366]  You want the answer to defeating the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen, you get out there,
[01:45:32.563 --> 01:45:33.724]  And you do it!
[01:45:33.724 --> 01:45:36.545]  Because we don't have any future if we don't.
[01:45:36.545 --> 01:45:37.726]  I want to finish up the Sheen interview.
[01:45:37.726 --> 01:45:40.288]  How much is left of this Virgin interview?
[01:45:40.288 --> 01:45:46.711]  How much is left on the timeline?
[01:45:46.711 --> 01:45:51.254]  The globalists have learned how to play us off against each other, how to divide and conquer.
[01:45:51.254 --> 01:45:52.154]  We can't allow that to happen.
[01:45:52.154 --> 01:45:53.115]  It's about the ideas.
[01:45:53.115 --> 01:45:56.077]  We have to take action and get the word out.
[01:45:56.077 --> 01:45:56.817]  So let's just say it.
[01:45:56.817 --> 01:45:57.698]  I'm the bad man.
[01:45:57.698 --> 01:45:58.578]  I'm evil.
[01:45:58.578 --> 01:45:59.399]  I'm all these things.
[01:45:59.399 --> 01:45:59.759]  I'm not.
[01:46:00.825 --> 01:46:02.967]  I'm sure not perfect, fine.
[01:46:02.967 --> 01:46:05.849]  But what are we going to do about Argentina collapse, folks?
[01:46:05.849 --> 01:46:07.730]  What are you going to do when you're homeless?
[01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:10.792]  What are you going to do when they implode the economy by design to bring in martial law?
[01:46:10.792 --> 01:46:12.533]  This is real!
[01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:14.054]  I'm concerned!
[01:46:14.054 --> 01:46:14.995]  I'm really worried!
[01:46:14.995 --> 01:46:16.716]  I believe the things I say!
[01:46:16.716 --> 01:46:20.959]  I got up here in January and said they're planning something big with the flu!
[01:46:20.959 --> 01:46:24.922]  I told you we were at level 6 three months before it was made mainstream news!
[01:46:24.922 --> 01:46:26.243]  I get sent secret documents!
[01:46:27.583 --> 01:46:29.666]  I got army intelligence following me around.
[01:46:29.666 --> 01:46:31.529]  The mainstream media admits it.
[01:46:31.529 --> 01:46:34.214]  I have the army following me around.
[01:46:36.428 --> 01:46:37.669]  That are in the Fed events.
[01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:40.130]  This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:40.130 --> 01:46:41.591]  What Charlie Sheen is doing is real.
[01:46:41.591 --> 01:46:42.832]  The establishment hates it.
[01:46:42.832 --> 01:46:44.012]  Because they know I'm right.
[01:46:44.012 --> 01:46:44.993]  They know I'm a good person.
[01:46:44.993 --> 01:46:46.034]  They know my heart's in the right place.
[01:46:46.034 --> 01:46:47.294]  They know I'm a real leader.
[01:46:47.294 --> 01:46:48.715]  And they're desperate to tear that down.
[01:46:48.715 --> 01:46:49.896]  And let me tell you something.
[01:46:49.896 --> 01:46:50.656]  I've studied history.
[01:46:50.656 --> 01:46:52.117]  I don't want this leadership position.
[01:46:52.117 --> 01:46:52.997]  I don't like it.
[01:46:52.997 --> 01:46:54.658]  That's why I've always made it about you.
[01:46:54.658 --> 01:46:56.299]  Because that's the path to victory.
[01:46:56.299 --> 01:46:58.881]  And it's the path to me not getting my head blown off or set up.
[01:47:01.834 --> 01:47:06.119]  All right, let's finish up in three parts the Virgin Never Before Heard Sheen interview.
[01:47:06.119 --> 01:47:07.561]  Back to it, men.
[01:47:07.561 --> 01:47:16.933]  We've got James Stanley, the reporter for BBC World, and then simultaneously on BBC24 with other reporters, 25 minutes before Building 7 collapses after 5 p.m.
[01:47:16.933 --> 01:47:17.513]  in the afternoon.
[01:47:18.234 --> 01:47:25.357]  They get on the news and say Building 7 has collapsed into its own footprint symmetrically and right out the window is Building 7.
[01:47:25.357 --> 01:47:27.498]  And then the BBC for years wouldn't comment on it.
[01:47:27.498 --> 01:47:30.019]  Now they admit, oh that was just an accident.
[01:47:30.019 --> 01:47:36.001]  And then later they changed their story and said, oh Reuters sent us an internal report saying it had collapsed.
[01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:38.342]  First they said we've misplaced the tape.
[01:47:38.342 --> 01:47:39.523]  That was their first response.
[01:47:39.523 --> 01:47:42.124]  Well, at first immediate when we broke that.
[01:47:46.974 --> 01:47:47.134]  I don't
[01:48:01.724 --> 01:48:03.025]  BBC said they lost the tape.
[01:48:03.025 --> 01:48:04.186]  They couldn't comment.
[01:48:04.186 --> 01:48:04.787]  And you're right.
[01:48:04.787 --> 01:48:06.688]  Later they came on and said, OK, it was an accident.
[01:48:06.688 --> 01:48:08.990]  And we said, well, who fed you that?
[01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:10.712]  Somebody did false scripting.
[01:48:10.712 --> 01:48:18.498]  That's just like with JFK when stuff in Asia before Oswald had even been captured, they already had his name in newspapers.
[01:48:18.498 --> 01:48:19.319]  Somebody got that
[01:48:19.679 --> 01:48:22.501]  False scripting wrong, but this is in front of everybody on TV.
[01:48:22.501 --> 01:48:32.950]  They're saying building 7 has collapsed and its own footprint completely collapsed from fire and there it is right behind him and no steel building had ever collapsed from fire in all of history except that day.
[01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:34.932]  Tower 1 and 2, but they've been hit by a plane.
[01:48:34.932 --> 01:48:35.592]  That was their excuse.
[01:48:35.592 --> 01:48:39.856]  Jet fuel, pancaking, all of this, which NIST has now had to back off of.
[01:48:39.856 --> 01:48:43.479]  But then 7 is hit by nothing and then they false script.
[01:48:44.199 --> 01:48:46.320]  But I guess we're not supposed to ask those questions.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.681]  It's un-American.
[01:48:47.681 --> 01:48:55.867]  Just like, I guess MSNBC and Cy Hirsch New Yorker weren't supposed to report on Dick Cheney wanting to attack our ships in Lebanon and Iran.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.443]  Maybe according to them, it's unpatriotic.
[01:49:00.443 --> 01:49:05.748]  Well, I guess we've arrived at a place where it's unpatriotic to be a person of logic.
[01:49:05.748 --> 01:49:10.833]  Charlie, I noticed that you are critical of Barack Obama on his civil rights record.
[01:49:10.833 --> 01:49:13.615]  He said he was going to get rid of warrantless wiretapping against the American people.
[01:49:13.615 --> 01:49:14.236]  He's keeping it.
[01:49:14.236 --> 01:49:15.957]  He said he was going to vote against the Patriot Act.
[01:49:15.957 --> 01:49:17.178]  He voted to reauthorize it.
[01:49:17.178 --> 01:49:19.240]  He said he was going to end secret arrests.
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:21.342]  The rendition program he's keeping it.
[01:49:21.342 --> 01:49:22.523]  Let me just say this, Alex.
[01:49:25.037 --> 01:49:33.783]  He got my vote based on what I heard, but not on what I've observed since.
[01:49:33.783 --> 01:49:36.745]  So like Elvis says, a little less fraud, a little more action?
[01:49:36.745 --> 01:49:38.886]  Uh, amen, Elvis.
[01:49:38.886 --> 01:49:45.851]  Now you've also got the point that he attacked indefinite detention that Bush had, and then now he's just saying it's, what's the term you use in your letter?
[01:49:47.099 --> 01:49:48.019]  Permanent detention.
[01:49:48.019 --> 01:49:49.380]  Yes, it's permanent detention.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:55.082]  He's saying in speeches, even if somebody's found not guilty by the tribunal, we may just have to keep them for the rest of their lives.
[01:49:55.082 --> 01:49:57.283]  I mean, that sounds like Bush on steroids.
[01:49:57.283 --> 01:50:01.585]  Are you confident that if we put enough pressure on him, we can get him to investigation?
[01:50:01.585 --> 01:50:05.347]  I'm not confident about anything, Alex, but... So you're just trying.
[01:50:05.347 --> 01:50:06.587]  You're just doing your best.
[01:50:06.587 --> 01:50:07.147]  Absolutely.
[01:50:07.147 --> 01:50:08.848]  Duty is ours, consequence belongs to God.
[01:50:08.848 --> 01:50:09.448]  There you go.
[01:50:09.448 --> 01:50:10.949]  The greatest journey begins with the first step.
[01:50:11.294 --> 01:50:13.617]  Charles, let's go over just a few of these points in your letter.
[01:50:13.617 --> 01:50:18.682]  I mean, folks can obviously go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and it's all over the web now.
[01:50:18.682 --> 01:50:27.812]  They can read it for themselves and check out all the footnotes and links to the official record that shows that we've got the facts in their line.
[01:50:27.812 --> 01:50:29.593]  But I notice in there you talk about
[01:50:30.354 --> 01:50:33.175]  Something that came out last year that's gotten hardly any attention.
[01:50:33.175 --> 01:50:45.199]  Cy Hersch, Pulitzer Prize winner, New Yorker Magazine, comes out and even gives speeches, saying that Dick Cheney was planning to paint up fake Iranian patrol boats, man them with Navy SEALs, and have them attack U.S.
[01:50:45.199 --> 01:50:49.421]  destroyers in the Strait of Hormuz to blame it on Iran.
[01:50:49.421 --> 01:50:51.361]  I love how you put that in your piece.
[01:50:51.361 --> 01:50:59.184]  That right there to the President should be plenty of evidence to open an investigation on 9-11, because you've got Operation Northwood you mentioned, you've got Donald Tompkins,
[01:51:01.104 --> 01:51:08.047]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:51:08.047 --> 01:51:10.909]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:51:10.909 --> 01:51:15.551]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[01:51:15.551 --> 01:51:20.053]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:51:20.053 --> 01:51:21.934]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:51:22.054 --> 01:51:22.574]  We're good to go!
[01:51:41.527 --> 01:51:41.787]  I think so.
[01:52:01.374 --> 01:52:10.598]  If you or your parents are 62 years of age or older and a homeowner, RMApply.com has a message that is vitally important for you and your family.

[01:52:46.032 --> 01:52:49.154]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[01:53:08.831 --> 01:53:10.093]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:53:10.093 --> 01:53:17.142]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:53:17.142 --> 01:53:25.654]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:53:26.021 --> 01:53:33.123]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:53:33.123 --> 01:53:36.284]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:53:36.284 --> 01:53:41.406]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:53:42.066 --> 01:53:45.129]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:53:45.129 --> 01:53:51.194]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:53:51.194 --> 01:53:54.117]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:53:54.117 --> 01:53:59.062]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:53:59.824 --> 01:54:05.187]  But I notice in there you talk about something that came out last year that's gotten hardly any attention.
[01:54:05.187 --> 01:54:17.694]  Cy Hersch, Pulitzer Prize winner, New Yorker magazine, comes out and even gives speeches saying that Dick Cheney was planning to paint up fake Iranian patrol boats, man them with Navy SEALs, and have them attack U.S.
[01:54:17.694 --> 01:54:21.436]  destroyers in the Strait of Hormuz to blame it on Iran.
[01:54:21.436 --> 01:54:24.258]  I love how you put that in your piece, that right there to the point.
[01:54:24.298 --> 01:54:25.658]  I mean look, I know I'm ranting
[01:54:46.175 --> 01:54:48.096]  One would hope so, Alex.
[01:54:48.096 --> 01:54:49.957]  One would like to believe such would be the case.
[01:55:07.885 --> 01:55:15.732]  However, as I say to the President in my letter, Mr. President, I really wish I was making this stuff up.
[01:55:15.732 --> 01:55:18.194]  I'd sleep a lot better at night if I were.
[01:55:18.194 --> 01:55:24.499]  Charlie, we're just a few hours into your letter being published, and already a lot of media is asking the question, is Charlie Sheen serious?
[01:55:24.499 --> 01:55:26.381]  Does he really want a meeting with the President?
[01:55:26.381 --> 01:55:32.325]  You told me on the phone earlier, and you told me earlier before we were on air, that yes indeed, you do want an interview.
[01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:32.806]  Absolutely.
[01:55:33.607 --> 01:55:34.127]  Absolutely.
[01:55:34.127 --> 01:55:39.329]  I would not have constructed this document if that was not my ultimate goal.
[01:55:39.329 --> 01:55:40.969]  So is this letter to get his attention?
[01:55:40.969 --> 01:55:42.750]  I mean, I'm sure this is going to go across his desk.
[01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:44.050]  I would hope so.
[01:55:44.050 --> 01:55:44.751]  I would hope so.
[01:55:44.751 --> 01:56:01.676]  And if it doesn't, if for some reason this doesn't make it into his hands and I'm never granted my 20 minutes with my president, then I would urge the American people, I would urge anybody and everybody that has a stake in this, which would be all of us,
[01:56:02.296 --> 01:56:09.898]  To continue to apply the pressure, to continue to ask the questions, to continue to demand the truth.
[01:56:09.898 --> 01:56:14.339]  Charlie, in your gut, do you think the President's going to actually give that interview?
[01:56:14.339 --> 01:56:16.500]  Because regardless, he's going to see the questions.
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:21.021]  I mean, millions of people now are going to be reading your letter and they're going to be asking these questions.
[01:56:21.021 --> 01:56:22.882]  So either way, the truth wins.
[01:56:22.882 --> 01:56:25.702]  And the truth always wins, Alex.
[01:56:25.702 --> 01:56:28.583]  The truth is unchanging, as I stated earlier.
[01:56:28.583 --> 01:56:31.024]  If the President ignores this, that's on him.
[01:56:32.347 --> 01:56:34.908]  If he accepts it, that's on me.
[01:56:34.908 --> 01:56:40.431]  Charlie, your letter to the President closes by you saying to him, make sure you're on the right side of history.
[01:56:40.431 --> 01:56:41.871]  What did you mean by that?
[01:56:41.871 --> 01:56:46.573]  What I meant by that, Alex, was that this is his chance to do the right thing.
[01:56:46.573 --> 01:56:53.216]  And for much too long now, our government has been on the wrong side of history.
[01:56:56.749 --> 01:56:58.711]  Was it this sounded like the president?
[01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:05.118]  In fact, I noticed that some of the things in his responses were quotes or paraphrase quotes from things he's actually said.
[01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:06.600]  You did your research on this.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.122]  How long did it take you to write this letter?
[01:57:09.704 --> 01:57:13.928]  Yes, I did do my research and I did take my time.
[01:57:13.928 --> 01:57:19.714]  It was, there were some very long nights and some very long days, probably over a two-week period.
[01:57:19.714 --> 01:57:25.739]  But let's face it, Alex, these people, at the end of the day, they're in show business.
[01:57:25.739 --> 01:57:26.720]  I'm in show business.
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:33.867]  So, you know, these people read from scripts, I read from scripts, so it's not too far-fetched.
[01:57:34.287 --> 01:57:40.130]  For me to grasp the nature and the style in which they communicate.
[01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:45.333]  Speaking of reading off scripts, Obama won't give a speech unless he's reading off those teleprompters.
[01:57:45.333 --> 01:57:50.015]  And more often than not, it seems like he does the opposite of what he says he's going to do.
[01:57:50.015 --> 01:57:55.238]  I noticed in your letter you're a little bit rough on him when it comes to some of his police state activities.
[01:57:55.238 --> 01:57:59.640]  Were you shocked as an Obama supporter to see him go back on some of his promises?
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:00.261]  Was I shocked?
[01:58:01.121 --> 01:58:01.701]  Yes.
[01:58:01.701 --> 01:58:03.522]  Was I disappointed?
[01:58:03.522 --> 01:58:04.022]  Absolutely.
[01:58:04.022 --> 01:58:05.863]  Was I surprised?
[01:58:05.863 --> 01:58:07.244]  Certainly not.
[01:58:07.244 --> 01:58:08.904]  This is the political age that we live in.
[01:58:08.904 --> 01:58:12.886]  But we have to break out of that mold.
[01:58:12.886 --> 01:58:14.167]  We have to reject this.
[01:58:14.167 --> 01:58:17.828]  We have to stop accepting the fact that that's just what they do.
[01:58:17.828 --> 01:58:18.668]  They just lie to us.
[01:58:18.668 --> 01:58:21.450]  No, because look at the history of it.
[01:58:21.450 --> 01:58:25.991]  Ultimately, it just leads to bigger and more damaging lies down the road.
[01:58:28.843 --> 01:58:33.324]  Alright folks, we're going to come back in the last three minutes of the interview with Charlie Sheen.
[01:58:33.324 --> 01:58:35.625]  The taped interview, he was on live with us in the first hour.
[01:58:35.625 --> 01:58:42.827]  We'll be back live Friday with bigger, more important developments.
[01:58:42.827 --> 01:58:45.427]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.427 --> 01:58:48.588]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.018 --> 01:58:55.981]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:59:21.358 --> 01:59:21.658]  We're good.
[01:59:53.712 --> 01:59:56.113]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.113 --> 02:00:05.518]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.518 --> 02:00:06.818]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.818 --> 02:00:08.579]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.579 --> 02:00:10.340]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:11.921]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.921 --> 02:00:13.862]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.862 --> 02:00:17.664]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.664 --> 02:00:21.786]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.987 --> 02:00:25.009]  Well, Mr. Sheen, I want to commend you for your courage.
[02:00:25.009 --> 02:00:26.049]  I want to thank you for doing this interview.
[02:00:26.049 --> 02:00:34.736]  I want to thank you for writing that letter to the President because our country, our society, our world has no future unless people start getting involved and getting informed.
[02:00:35.490 --> 02:00:42.536]  And you've just done an incredible amount of research, going through your letter with all the hyperlinks to official government documents and mainstream media.
[02:00:42.536 --> 02:00:44.818]  This stuff really is hidden in plain view.
[02:00:44.818 --> 02:00:49.903]  And tens of millions more people are now going to find out the truth about 9-11 because of what you've done.
[02:00:49.903 --> 02:00:52.946]  So I just want to thank you for spending time with us today and what you've done.
[02:00:52.946 --> 02:00:59.151]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex, and I'd just like to say in closing that I not only
[02:01:00.467 --> 02:01:10.632]  I encourage people to read my letter, but I challenge them to read it, and I challenge them to do their own research, to cross-check their facts.
[02:01:10.632 --> 02:01:14.974]  I challenge them to ask the hard questions and wake people up.
[02:01:14.974 --> 02:01:17.575]  And I challenge them to demand the truth.
[02:01:17.575 --> 02:01:19.256]  The ball is in the American people's court.
[02:01:19.256 --> 02:01:22.737]  I mean, you've put it into Obama's court, giving him a chance to do the right thing.
[02:01:22.737 --> 02:01:25.839]  But regardless, as you said earlier, we've done the right thing.
[02:01:26.639 --> 02:01:26.979]  Absolutely.
[02:01:49.346 --> 02:01:53.907]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[02:01:53.907 --> 02:01:56.628]  And thanks to good people like you, Charlie, we've got a fighting chance.
[02:01:56.628 --> 02:01:58.688]  And that time I was on CNN.
[02:01:58.688 --> 02:02:00.169]  And then, of course, you know.
[02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:02.469]  And there's one other quote I love.
[02:02:02.469 --> 02:02:04.170]  And that was by Mark Twain.
[02:02:04.170 --> 02:02:08.170]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared.
[02:02:08.170 --> 02:02:11.051]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the time to join him.
[02:02:11.051 --> 02:02:13.872]  Because then, it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:02:13.872 --> 02:02:16.312]  And you, Charlie Sheen, are a patriot.
[02:02:16.312 --> 02:02:18.233]  Thank you for spending this time with us today.
[02:02:18.233 --> 02:02:18.733]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:21.204 --> 02:02:28.029]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that was the 21-minute audio interview I did a few weeks ago at his home.
[02:02:28.029 --> 02:02:31.471]  We have a video that's pretty hard-hitting.
[02:02:31.471 --> 02:02:38.356]  Aaron's been spending a week on it, and it's a video of Charlie Sheen editing it together that's coming up tomorrow.
[02:02:38.356 --> 02:02:46.542]  Tomorrow, we're going to be playing that, and then Charlie Sheen for a full, at least 30-minute, maybe longer interview coming up.
[02:02:47.999 --> 02:02:49.500]  On Friday on 9-1-1.
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:51.421]  Today is 9-9-9.
[02:02:51.421 --> 02:02:55.724]  Now, other issues I haven't gotten to...
[02:02:57.796 --> 02:02:59.838]  And Richard Gage is with us 30-40 minutes or so.
[02:02:59.838 --> 02:03:03.983]  When he leaves is Obama to seal US-UN relationship.
[02:03:03.983 --> 02:03:07.647]  Barack Obama will submit the new cooperative relationship between the US and the United Nations.
[02:03:07.647 --> 02:03:11.411]  This month he becomes the first American president to chair the 15-member Security Council.
[02:03:11.411 --> 02:03:12.192]  First time in history.
[02:03:12.192 --> 02:03:14.835]  See, everything is being put in his hands.
[02:03:14.835 --> 02:03:15.536]  Power-wise.
[02:03:15.536 --> 02:03:18.659]  The whole police state, the North Com, Homeland Security.
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:22.062]  All the powers being matched in the President's hands.
[02:03:22.062 --> 02:03:27.766]  The topic for the summit level session of the Council, September 24th, is nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament.
[02:03:27.766 --> 02:03:30.228]  One of the several global challenges the U.S.
[02:03:30.228 --> 02:03:33.290]  now wants to see addressed, and so it goes on from there.
[02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:43.417]  But the Council is really about controlling tax rates worldwide, controlling currency rates, and that's actually in the Associated Press, also McClatchy Newspapers reporting on it today.
[02:03:43.417 --> 02:03:47.120]  A year after financial crisis, a new world order emerges.
[02:03:48.114 --> 02:03:52.837]  And they're all over the news and other reports announcing world government through and by the banks.
[02:03:52.837 --> 02:03:58.141]  So, this makes me actually not shake, but shiver.
[02:03:58.141 --> 02:04:00.402]  I mean, I just shivered.
[02:04:00.402 --> 02:04:01.283]  It's all so real.
[02:04:01.283 --> 02:04:05.866]  They really are eugenicists, as the White House Science Czar's own textbook that he wrote shows.
[02:04:05.866 --> 02:04:07.247]  They really are wicked.
[02:04:07.247 --> 02:04:10.188]  I mean, the Gardasil really is killing people.
[02:04:10.188 --> 02:04:14.932]  And I just wish all the trolls and everybody else would just spend their time warning girls about Gardasil.
[02:04:16.007 --> 02:04:19.829]  We know it's killing them and maiming them and paralyzing them.
[02:04:19.829 --> 02:04:32.054]  Three years ago I was called a kook for reading the actual, two and a half, three years ago, reading the actual documents on air from the trials of the vaccine, the human papillomavirus vaccine, when it was killing people.
[02:04:32.054 --> 02:04:33.295]  And now it's all on the news again.
[02:04:35.626 --> 02:04:42.212]  Then articles come out in ABC News that Merck, quote, has hit teams that, quote, seek and destroy doctors and scientists that expose them.
[02:04:42.212 --> 02:04:47.357]  And Merck says, oh, that's just a joke in our internal corporate minutes.
[02:04:47.357 --> 02:04:50.320]  Man, this is serious.
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:53.904]  Bayer Pharmaceutical knowingly shipped out all the age-tainted blood over a million people.
[02:04:53.904 --> 02:04:56.847]  I mean, this is just incredible who we're facing.
[02:04:56.847 --> 02:04:59.109]  We've got to wake up and face it.
[02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.790]  Demand the truth.
[02:05:02.128 --> 02:05:05.131]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:05.131 --> 02:05:10.476]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:10.476 --> 02:05:12.517]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:12.517 --> 02:05:17.522]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:17.522 --> 02:05:18.443]  How much do you want?
[02:05:18.683 --> 02:05:19.824]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.824 --> 02:05:21.705]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:21.705 --> 02:05:22.766]  When will you need it?
[02:05:22.766 --> 02:05:24.967]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.967 --> 02:05:26.308]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:26.308 --> 02:05:27.849]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.849 --> 02:05:33.113]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:33.113 --> 02:05:36.695]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:36.695 --> 02:05:40.158]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:40.518 --> 02:05:41.738]  How much will you need?
[02:05:41.738 --> 02:05:42.639]  We don't know.
[02:05:42.639 --> 02:05:43.739]  How much do you want?
[02:05:43.739 --> 02:05:44.659]  All you can get.
[02:05:44.659 --> 02:05:45.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:48.821]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:48.821 --> 02:05:50.602]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:50.602 --> 02:05:51.502]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:01.274 --> 02:06:05.497]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:06:05.497 --> 02:06:07.518]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:06:07.518 --> 02:06:16.024]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:06:16.024 --> 02:06:21.588]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:06:21.588 --> 02:06:23.450]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:06:23.450 --> 02:06:26.692]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost
[02:06:26.732 --> 02:06:26.992]  That's right.
[02:06:26.992 --> 02:06:28.673]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:06:28.673 --> 02:06:29.634]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[02:06:29.634 --> 02:06:29.894]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:06:29.894 --> 02:06:30.995]  Or visit Ecola Blue on the web.
[02:06:54.613 --> 02:06:55.657]  We're good.
[02:07:01.544 --> 02:07:02.144]  Tired?
[02:07:02.144 --> 02:07:04.005]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[02:07:04.005 --> 02:07:07.285]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[02:07:07.285 --> 02:07:10.306]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[02:07:10.306 --> 02:07:16.948]  Liquid zeolite, available only at RestoreYourHealthNow.com, captures toxins and physically carries them out of your body.
[02:07:16.948 --> 02:07:21.589]  This safe and effective way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:29.831]  Studies show that liquid zeolite captures triggering antigens, which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[02:07:30.171 --> 02:07:38.615]  Liquid Zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that, when taken daily, supports a healthy, happy and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[02:07:38.615 --> 02:07:41.916]  And Liquid Zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.

[02:07:52.361 --> 02:07:52.901]  That's 1-800-976-0025 today.
[02:08:01.283 --> 02:08:06.684]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.684 --> 02:08:13.126]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.126 --> 02:08:18.747]  Well, the 8th anniversary of the tragic staged terror attacks of 9-11 is approaching.
[02:08:18.747 --> 02:08:25.449]  The 8th anniversary, I would just remind people that we were called conspiracy theorists just three years ago for saying the Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[02:08:25.449 --> 02:08:28.950]  It's now declassified that those were staged attacks on our ships.
[02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:29.610]  To blame it,
[02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:36.919]  Uh, on the Vietnamese who started the Vietnam War that killed over a million and a half Vietnamese and over 58,000 Americans, injuring over 200,000 Americans.
[02:08:36.919 --> 02:08:45.370]  I just want to point out Operation Ajax, staged terror attacks that were blamed on the government of Iran, is declassified at the CIA's own history section.
[02:08:46.721 --> 02:08:53.647]  I just want to point out that it's now been declassified by the NSA, that the USS Liberty attack was staged to be blamed on Egypt.
[02:08:53.647 --> 02:09:00.213]  That came out years after many people exposed it, long before I was on the scene it was exposed, 20-something, 30 years ago.
[02:09:00.213 --> 02:09:03.055]  Well, that happened in 67, but it was exposed from day one.
[02:09:03.055 --> 02:09:05.817]  That's now come out.
[02:09:05.817 --> 02:09:07.559]  Operation Northwoods has been declassified.
[02:09:07.559 --> 02:09:07.859]  The U.S.
[02:09:07.859 --> 02:09:09.020]  government planned to bomb U.S.
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:12.904]  cities and crash jets and blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:09:12.904 --> 02:09:13.964]  That's been declassified.
[02:09:15.134 --> 02:09:21.879]  And Army Field Manual from 2004 has been declassified where it talks about how to stage false flag terror attacks.
[02:09:21.879 --> 02:09:29.964]  It's come out that six of the ten 9-11 Commission members even told the Washington Post that the 9-11 Commission was a fraud and a lie and a cover-up and needed to be criminally investigated.
[02:09:29.964 --> 02:09:34.788]  It's even been in the news but never gets any traction, never becomes a big issue.
[02:09:34.788 --> 02:09:38.010]  We can't just sit here idly by and let all this continue.
[02:09:39.042 --> 02:09:43.084]  So my point is, you're crazy to not know about the history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:09:43.084 --> 02:09:55.749]  You're crazy to not know about all the cases out there where Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag on February 27th to get police state going in Germany.
[02:09:55.749 --> 02:09:57.330]  Or how Stalin staged terror attacks.
[02:09:57.330 --> 02:10:01.852]  Or how the Tsarist, one of their favorite tactics was to stage terror attacks and blame it on their enemies.
[02:10:01.852 --> 02:10:06.774]  Or how British intelligence has now been declassified and caught staging many of the IRA bombings.
[02:10:06.774 --> 02:10:07.354]  Some were real.
[02:10:08.835 --> 02:10:15.324]  Or, Haaretz and Jerusalem Post admit that, quote, Israel headline created fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[02:10:15.324 --> 02:10:16.826]  Every time there was about to be a peace deal.
[02:10:16.826 --> 02:10:19.710]  There is, of course, real terrorism in Israel going on, and it's terrible.
[02:10:19.710 --> 02:10:24.177]  But the point is, Israeli papers admit the government's been caught staging it at key points.
[02:10:26.089 --> 02:10:27.770]  That's what we're talking about here.
[02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:29.170]  And then you look at the science.
[02:10:29.170 --> 02:10:39.233]  The establishment likes to do these hit pieces on the science because they know the general public aren't architects or engineers or physicists or underwriting laboratories people like Kevin Ryan.
[02:10:39.233 --> 02:10:43.614]  They can shoot a missile into a chicken coop and say it would have blown the Pentagon up.
[02:10:43.614 --> 02:10:48.036]  They can show you a three-story building and say if we would have blown it up we would have found Detcourt.
[02:10:49.522 --> 02:11:01.248]  I mean, they can do so many little things, little gimmicks, or say we're crazy and just want to believe this, when the history that we have is a continual chain of staged terror attacks.
[02:11:01.248 --> 02:11:07.191]  Now, on the Charlie Sheen issue, and we're going to Richard Gage, this is less than 24 hours after the media picked this up.
[02:11:07.191 --> 02:11:09.812]  They picked it up first in the afternoon yesterday.
[02:11:09.812 --> 02:11:12.714]  At about 4 o'clock, we saw the first mainstream news stories.
[02:11:12.714 --> 02:11:16.516]  Now, 20 hours into this, or 21 hours into this,
[02:11:17.543 --> 02:11:18.543]  Fox News.
[02:11:18.543 --> 02:11:25.486]  Charlie Sheen seeks meeting with Obama to discuss 9-1-1 cover-up.
[02:11:25.486 --> 02:11:26.547]  Look at this story out of E!
[02:11:26.547 --> 02:11:27.147]  Entertainment.
[02:11:27.147 --> 02:11:27.827]  Front page.
[02:11:27.827 --> 02:11:33.130]  Charlie Sheen, the truther, teaches Obama about 9-11.
[02:11:33.130 --> 02:11:33.390]  U.S.
[02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:34.330]  News & World Report.
[02:11:34.330 --> 02:11:37.151]  Charlie Sheen joins the truther, 9-1-1 conspiracy theory fringe.
[02:11:37.151 --> 02:11:38.232]  Fact piece.
[02:11:38.232 --> 02:11:38.552]  L.A.
[02:11:38.552 --> 02:11:39.452]  Times.
[02:11:39.452 --> 02:11:40.633]  Top of the ticket section.
[02:11:40.633 --> 02:11:41.954]  Top political news.
[02:11:41.954 --> 02:11:42.334]  Breaking.
[02:11:42.334 --> 02:11:45.215]  Charlie Sheen demands Obama meeting on 9-1-1 cover-up.
[02:11:48.578 --> 02:11:49.219]  Here's another one.
[02:11:49.219 --> 02:11:52.621]  Charlie Sheen, Fantasy 9-1-1 Truth, or Grilling of the President.
[02:11:52.621 --> 02:11:55.704]  Gawker.
[02:11:55.704 --> 02:11:57.626]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:11:57.626 --> 02:12:01.829]  President Obama, Charlie Sheen, Van Jones, the 9-1-1 Truth Movement.
[02:12:01.829 --> 02:12:05.552]  This is out of Associated Content.
[02:12:05.552 --> 02:12:07.294]  And it goes on and on.
[02:12:07.294 --> 02:12:07.874]  Here's one.
[02:12:07.874 --> 02:12:10.416]  I mean, there's just so many of these.
[02:12:10.416 --> 02:12:12.078]  The Houston Chronicle.
[02:12:16.601 --> 02:12:18.002]  There's just too many to cover them all.
[02:12:18.002 --> 02:12:19.222]  Very, very exciting.
[02:12:19.222 --> 02:12:27.365]  That's why Charlie wrote the letter about a meeting with the President, so that it would become a big issue of him wanting to actually meet with the President.
[02:12:27.365 --> 02:12:31.627]  That's what he talked about earlier when he was live on the show, in the tape interview we just aired.
[02:12:31.627 --> 02:12:34.048]  That's the whole point of what we're doing.
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.080]  Okay?
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:39.482]  Is to get people to look at those 20 points in the 20 questions of the President.
[02:12:39.482 --> 02:12:41.362]  And it was all Charlie's idea.
[02:12:41.362 --> 02:12:44.904]  Every bit of it was done exactly the way he wanted.
[02:12:44.904 --> 02:12:46.924]  And it was a genius idea.
[02:12:46.924 --> 02:12:48.025]  Even a brilliant idea.
[02:12:48.025 --> 02:12:54.727]  Even people criticizing him and don't agree with 9-11 Truth are saying it was very well written.
[02:12:54.727 --> 02:12:56.247]  So, it's very exciting.
[02:12:56.247 --> 02:12:57.228]  Let's go to Richard Gage.
[02:12:57.228 --> 02:13:00.129]  Richard, I appreciate you coming on.
[02:13:00.129 --> 02:13:02.310]  First off, the Charlie's Scene situation.
[02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:03.170]  What's your take on it?
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:13.590]  Well, we need people in the entertainment world, in Hollywood, talking about 9-11 truth.
[02:13:13.590 --> 02:13:17.014]  And Charlie began this, what, four years ago?
[02:13:17.014 --> 02:13:17.835]  Five years ago?
[02:13:17.835 --> 02:13:18.856]  Three and a half years ago.
[02:13:19.309 --> 02:13:19.970]  Three and a half.
[02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:26.477]  He took so much heat for this that he had to back off until there was more support at a grassroots level.
[02:13:26.477 --> 02:13:27.618]  And we've got that now.
[02:13:27.618 --> 02:13:36.288]  We've got 830 architects and engineers backing him up, saying, yes, these buildings came down by explosive controlled demolition.
[02:13:36.288 --> 02:13:40.113]  So with all of this support and others, of course, across the 9-11 Truth Movement,
[02:13:40.573 --> 02:13:55.243]  Supporting him, he can come out and make a splash now, and maybe it's time, Alex, and you've really supported him and given him a vehicle for this expression of coming out of the closet again and building truth.
[02:13:55.243 --> 02:13:56.864]  This is what has to happen.
[02:13:56.864 --> 02:14:06.011]  And then it has to happen with Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura and others who have kind of squeaked a little bit here and there, but now it's time, isn't it?
[02:14:08.032 --> 02:14:10.734]  Well, it certainly is, my friend.
[02:14:10.734 --> 02:14:15.897]  So much is going on, so much is happening right now.
[02:14:15.897 --> 02:14:22.501]  Let's get into... There's several new hit pieces for Discovery Channel and History Channel and A&E that are being made.
[02:14:22.501 --> 02:14:23.942]  PBS is making another hit piece.
[02:14:23.942 --> 02:14:27.924]  The British have made six in the last year and a half that I know of.
[02:14:27.924 --> 02:14:30.366]  Just absolutely ridiculous.
[02:14:30.366 --> 02:14:32.067]  All of that is going on and happening.
[02:14:33.047 --> 02:14:47.353]  And then at the same time, we have this latest big budget, and I was reading it was funded by Dubai, our foreign country, with this really shoddy hour-long special that spends a half of it on our psychology.
[02:14:47.353 --> 02:14:53.856]  And they played all sorts of little tricks with the camera, all sorts of things they did, the way they always made it your opinion.
[02:14:53.856 --> 02:15:00.919]  We talked Sunday, but I want you to recap and expand on that, how you gave them all the evidence, all the facts, and they would never allow that to be shown in the show.
[02:15:00.919 --> 02:15:01.679]  I mean, really,
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.281]  Outrageous, but I think it's backfiring on them.
[02:15:05.281 --> 02:15:12.024]  And it was made by a famous production house that specializes just in hit pieces, and quote, debunking conspiracy theorists.
[02:15:12.024 --> 02:15:18.486]  I mean, they do piece after piece creative differences, who I've refused to be interviewed by at a JFK piece in 9-11.
[02:15:18.486 --> 02:15:20.427]  So, break it down for us.
[02:15:20.427 --> 02:15:28.850]  As an architect, as an engineer who's built major structures, who has 800 architects and engineers, and thousands of other students who are becoming engineers and architects on your team, but 800 plus
[02:15:35.173 --> 02:15:41.074]  Well, we've been speaking all across the country now for three years.
[02:15:41.074 --> 02:15:46.816]  We've had over 110 presentations to thousands and thousands of people.
[02:15:46.816 --> 02:15:58.300]  We've toured Europe with nine cities in Europe, and next month we're going to Japan, Australia, and New Zealand for November.
[02:16:00.575 --> 02:16:12.003]  The key senator, Senator Yukihisa Fujita, whose party just won, took over their government basically.
[02:16:12.003 --> 02:16:15.285]  It was a minority party.
[02:16:15.285 --> 02:16:18.366]  This party is transforming Japan right now.
[02:16:18.366 --> 02:16:23.830]  It's kind of like the revolution we had, not revolution, the change we had from the Democrats to the Republicans.
[02:16:24.190 --> 02:16:25.931]  Excuse me, Republicans and Democrats.
[02:16:25.931 --> 02:16:28.912]  So he's bringing us to Tokyo and Kyoto.
[02:16:28.912 --> 02:16:29.652]  He'll introduce us.
[02:16:29.652 --> 02:16:39.756]  I mean, this is a huge opportunity for the 9-11 truth movement because he himself has been traveling around the world talking about 9-11 truth.
[02:16:39.756 --> 02:16:45.398]  And so we're very excited to speak in 14 different cities all together in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.
[02:16:45.398 --> 02:16:46.419]  And let me just throw a caveat in.
[02:16:47.410 --> 02:17:02.979]  Um, as of a year ago when he first went public and we interviewed him here as well and he's since traveled to New York and other major cities of the world, he was the number three person in his party in the diet, now his party.
[02:17:04.039 --> 02:17:20.549]  For after decades and decades out of power is now in power and as you said the president of his party is now the president of the country so we need to go look at the power structure but I believe he's number two now in the Japanese government is a 9-11 truther who shows
[02:17:21.269 --> 02:17:28.822]  Clips and clips of your films and clips of Professor Stephen Jones repeatedly in the Diet, in their Congress.
[02:17:28.822 --> 02:17:30.805]  I mean, this is all over Japanese TV.
[02:17:30.805 --> 02:17:33.610]  They came and interviewed me many times.
[02:17:33.610 --> 02:17:34.993]  But I mean, this is incredible!
[02:17:38.369 --> 02:17:43.152]  I'm excited about it, too, and we get to go there and be right in the middle of it and learn a whole lot more about it.
[02:17:43.152 --> 02:17:50.177]  In fact, they're booking the Diet itself, the governmental body, the building.
[02:17:50.177 --> 02:17:51.538]  We're going to be speaking there.
[02:17:51.538 --> 02:17:54.080]  That's the plan at this point.
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:18:01.085]  Not to their government, but having the public come to that place.
[02:18:01.085 --> 02:18:01.926]  Unbelievable.
[02:18:01.926 --> 02:18:06.549]  So that would be like having a huge 9-11 truth investigation in the House or in the Senate.
[02:18:07.039 --> 02:18:07.599]  Yeah!
[02:18:07.599 --> 02:18:08.260]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:10.741]  I mean, that's pretty exciting.
[02:18:10.741 --> 02:18:16.043]  So we'll try to put something very special together for that.
[02:18:16.043 --> 02:18:25.387]  Last night, I had the opportunity to speak to a packed house of 200 at the Commonwealth Club of California.
[02:18:25.387 --> 02:18:26.807]  We webcast this live.
[02:18:26.807 --> 02:18:28.288]  We had 435 people listening live also from home.
[02:18:33.317 --> 02:18:56.011]  On their computers, and I had 40 minutes to present all of the evidence, which, by the way, I very carefully laid out before Robert Erickson of Creative Differences, who was the producer for this National Geographic Entertainment piece, we call it, that many people have had the opportunity to see.
[02:18:56.751 --> 02:19:02.895]  And we'll be talking about how they go about distorting what we have to say.
[02:19:02.895 --> 02:19:23.367]  But it's very important that people understand that I spent an hour with him highlighting the evidence of the free-fall acceleration of World Trade Center 7 in the pools of molten iron that are found underneath it in the Twin Towers.
[02:19:24.079 --> 02:19:42.743]  And all of this evidence, the massive expulsion of perimeter wall sections, 600 feet at 70 miles an hour, instant acceleration out of the side of the Twin Towers, no floors found at the bottom of the Twin Towers, pulverized concrete, 90,000 tons of it.
[02:19:42.743 --> 02:19:44.963]  Richard, we got a break here in about 15 seconds.
[02:19:44.963 --> 02:19:45.443]  Stay there.
[02:19:45.443 --> 02:19:46.223]  We're going to come back.
[02:19:46.223 --> 02:19:48.804]  Because you talked about this Sunday, but a lot of people didn't hear it.
[02:19:49.867 --> 02:19:51.529]  about this guy being a big liar.
[02:19:51.529 --> 02:19:56.836]  So, directly from Richard Gage, you're going to hear what happened when we get back after this quick break.
[02:19:56.836 --> 02:19:57.217]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.072 --> 02:20:06.955]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[02:20:06.955 --> 02:20:12.098]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[02:20:12.098 --> 02:20:13.299]  That was then.
[02:20:13.299 --> 02:20:14.600]  This is now.
[02:20:14.600 --> 02:20:17.321]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[02:20:17.321 --> 02:20:23.385]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to 4 hours of real-time audio and video.
[02:20:23.385 --> 02:20:28.668]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings,
[02:20:28.928 --> 02:20:32.590]  Proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:36.051]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[02:20:36.051 --> 02:20:40.533]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[02:20:40.533 --> 02:20:42.054]  Video never lies.
[02:20:42.054 --> 02:20:43.715]  Watch Big Brother back.
[02:20:43.715 --> 02:20:45.495]  Visit diginet.net.
[02:20:45.495 --> 02:20:48.457]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:20:48.457 --> 02:20:51.078]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.

[02:20:57.942 --> 02:21:07.892]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:07.892 --> 02:21:09.574]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:10.529 --> 02:21:12.071]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.071 --> 02:21:12.872]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:12.872 --> 02:21:13.853]  This is his M.O.
[02:21:13.853 --> 02:21:15.254]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:15.254 --> 02:21:17.237]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.237 --> 02:21:24.385]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:24.385 --> 02:21:24.865]  Some U.S.
[02:21:24.865 --> 02:21:30.511]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.212 --> 02:21:34.674]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:34.674 --> 02:21:36.695]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:01.380 --> 02:22:05.442]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:22:05.442 --> 02:22:11.324]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:22:11.324 --> 02:22:12.444]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:22:12.444 --> 02:22:16.486]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:22:17.146 --> 02:22:30.952]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:22:30.952 --> 02:22:36.555]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:22:36.555 --> 02:22:42.378]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:22:43.198 --> 02:22:44.459]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:44.459 --> 02:22:46.180]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:22:46.180 --> 02:22:46.620]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:48.662]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:22:48.662 --> 02:22:48.722]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:02.054 --> 02:23:11.936]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[02:23:11.936 --> 02:23:13.977]  If so, you are not alone.
[02:23:13.977 --> 02:23:17.598]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[02:23:17.598 --> 02:23:30.741]  If you'd like to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then this might be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:23:31.101 --> 02:23:31.921]  We're good to go.
[02:24:05.651 --> 02:24:09.614]  They came and took it all away.
[02:24:09.614 --> 02:24:21.041]  Look at all these articles for people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:24:21.041 --> 02:24:24.584]  LA Times.
[02:24:24.584 --> 02:24:27.045]  Fox News.
[02:24:27.045 --> 02:24:27.506]  Reuters.
[02:24:31.004 --> 02:24:38.166]  Houston Chronicle, breaking Charlie Sheen demands Obama meeting on 9-1-1 cover-up.
[02:24:38.166 --> 02:24:41.266]  Again, if he just came out for 9-1-1 Truth again, there wouldn't be as much attention.
[02:24:41.266 --> 02:24:45.207]  But if he comes out and wants to talk to Obama, it ignites massive debate.
[02:24:45.207 --> 02:24:49.528]  That was his idea and it's much bigger than the last time he went public.
[02:24:49.528 --> 02:24:53.049]  24 hours into this, it is just exploding.
[02:24:53.049 --> 02:24:53.869]  Very, very exciting.
[02:24:53.869 --> 02:25:00.591]  Going back to Richard Gage, because I have this article here, Richard, I want to get back into the science and this guy saying, promising you he'd put
[02:25:02.014 --> 02:25:03.115]  No, I'm not aware of that, Alex.
[02:25:23.442 --> 02:25:24.363]  We're going to cover that later.
[02:25:24.363 --> 02:25:25.745]  We'll continue.
[02:25:25.745 --> 02:25:27.667]  So recap.
[02:25:27.667 --> 02:25:33.293]  Creative Differences, the production company that did the piece for National Geographic TV, the hit piece.
[02:25:33.293 --> 02:25:35.456]  First they said it wasn't a hit piece, it was going to be fair.
[02:25:35.456 --> 02:25:36.817]  They promised they'd show your science.
[02:25:36.817 --> 02:25:37.218]  Continue.
[02:25:38.015 --> 02:25:55.951]  Well yeah, they brought us down for the first interview, and I just mentioned before the break that we carefully laid out all of this information for them, and they're asking very intelligent questions, and they're nodding, and he was aware that we were telling the truth, and he was very impressed by it.
[02:25:55.951 --> 02:25:57.192]  I have to tell you that.
[02:25:57.192 --> 02:25:58.033]  This guy knows
[02:25:58.693 --> 02:25:59.533]  What's going on?
[02:25:59.533 --> 02:26:04.455]  This is not some kind of unconscious skepticism or something.
[02:26:04.455 --> 02:26:14.517]  So, four months later, we're invited back because he wants to show us the rough cut.
[02:26:14.517 --> 02:26:21.279]  Because he has had criticism in the past where he felt, he said people have thought that they're
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:25.702]  Their interviews were taken out of context, and so forth.
[02:26:25.702 --> 02:26:37.168]  So he brings us back, and actually, I'm watching myself in the rough cut with all this evidence, and I'm delighted, because, you know, we're talking about molten metal.
[02:26:37.168 --> 02:26:41.310]  We're talking about nanothermite chips found in the dust.
[02:26:41.310 --> 02:26:44.492]  Very high-tech stuff, not made in a cave in Afghanistan.
[02:26:44.492 --> 02:26:49.695]  I think your next hour's guest, Steve Jones, will be talking in detail about that.
[02:26:50.430 --> 02:27:01.539]  But I told him about the small, previously molten iron spheres the size of a human hair that are found in all the dust samples ignited thermite by chemical analysis.
[02:27:01.539 --> 02:27:03.381]  Anyway, all this was in there.
[02:27:06.031 --> 02:27:07.932]  We're delighted, right?
[02:27:07.932 --> 02:27:11.773]  And then he brings out these experiments that he's done.
[02:27:11.773 --> 02:27:22.176]  Emertech, who's really nothing more than a defense contractor at New Mexico, because they're like Lawrence Livermore Lab or something.
[02:27:22.176 --> 02:27:24.637]  All of their money comes from defense.
[02:27:24.637 --> 02:27:25.777]  They're on the government payroll!
[02:27:26.357 --> 02:27:27.537]  That's for sure.
[02:27:27.537 --> 02:27:29.638]  And so they have these three experiments.
[02:27:29.638 --> 02:27:35.620]  They never talked to us about what experiments they might be doing.
[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:37.761]  Didn't get our input at all.
[02:27:37.761 --> 02:27:39.602]  We're just watching these experiments.
[02:27:39.602 --> 02:27:43.303]  So they lure you back to see the rough cut and it's these experiments?
[02:27:44.788 --> 02:27:48.749]  Then we see the rough cut, and we're delighted with what we were shown of ourselves.
[02:27:48.749 --> 02:27:52.851]  And then these experiments come on, and we're going, what the heck is this?
[02:27:52.851 --> 02:27:57.052]  And by the way, they're videotaping your response.
[02:27:57.052 --> 02:27:59.033]  They're like, come see the rough cut, now come in here.
[02:27:59.033 --> 02:28:00.733]  We want to show you some other clips.
[02:28:00.733 --> 02:28:02.114]  I mean, is that how this happened?
[02:28:02.114 --> 02:28:03.914]  And then really they're videotaping you?
[02:28:03.914 --> 02:28:11.557]  Yes, and the intent was not that they were going to use our responses in the final version.
[02:28:11.557 --> 02:28:12.737]  The intent was that
[02:28:13.462 --> 02:28:15.663]  What did he say?
[02:28:15.663 --> 02:28:19.424]  We just want a record that you're happy with what you saw, basically.
[02:28:19.424 --> 02:28:22.085]  So this is a manipulation, clearly.
[02:28:22.085 --> 02:28:38.692]  And I have to tell you, this thermite experiment, for instance, where they, excuse me, the beam, where they put this 8-inch tall I-beam across 500 gallons of jet fuel and light it,
[02:28:39.571 --> 02:28:53.322]  But a 3,000 pound load in the middle of this I-beam, and we have in a couple of minutes temperatures rising very high and causing the failure of this beam.
[02:28:53.322 --> 02:28:56.384]  Well, first of all, how'd they talk to us?
[02:28:56.384 --> 02:29:04.751]  And even if they didn't talk to us, they should have known that NIST, in their investigation, hired Underwriter Laboratories to develop
[02:29:05.462 --> 02:29:14.028]  An exact replica of the floor truss system with a composite deck of concrete and metal decking.
[02:29:14.028 --> 02:29:21.154]  And they had under laboratory conditions, ASTM E-119 is the test number.
[02:29:21.154 --> 02:29:28.319]  They put 2,000 degrees of fire under the truss and twice the known amount of loading on top of the floor system.
[02:29:29.276 --> 02:29:29.836]  Stay there.
[02:29:29.836 --> 02:29:30.677]  This is scientific.
[02:29:30.677 --> 02:29:31.917]  I don't want to interrupt this.
[02:29:31.917 --> 02:29:34.598]  Yes, the underwriting laboratories found it wouldn't happen.
[02:29:34.598 --> 02:29:38.119]  But see, one of their members goes public, releasing their report.
[02:29:38.119 --> 02:29:39.080]  They fire him.
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:39.980]  That's Kevin Ryan.
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:40.440]  Stay there.
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:45.142]  We're going to come right back with architect and engineer Richard Gage.
[02:29:45.142 --> 02:29:46.903]  Just powerful information.
[02:29:46.903 --> 02:29:51.564]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.564 --> 02:29:52.945]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.945 --> 02:29:55.506]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.506 --> 02:29:58.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.888 --> 02:30:06.215]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:30:06.215 --> 02:30:10.741]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:30:10.741 --> 02:30:13.004]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:30:13.004 --> 02:30:14.626]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:30:14.626 --> 02:30:15.668]  There is a solution.
[02:30:15.888 --> 02:30:24.310]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:01.169 --> 02:31:06.374]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:31:06.374 --> 02:31:10.398]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:10.398 --> 02:31:16.323]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:16.323 --> 02:31:21.168]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.388 --> 02:31:22.288]  Number 3.
[02:31:22.288 --> 02:31:27.910]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:28.590]  Number 4.
[02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:31.491]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:31:31.491 --> 02:31:35.152]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.152 --> 02:31:35.992]  Number 5.
[02:31:35.992 --> 02:31:39.613]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:31:39.853 --> 02:31:45.576]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[02:32:01.923 --> 02:32:06.206]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:32:06.206 --> 02:32:09.489]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:32:09.489 --> 02:32:17.275]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy if we the people
[02:32:17.535 --> 02:32:19.777]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[02:32:19.777 --> 02:32:22.159]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:32:22.159 --> 02:32:25.221]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom.
[02:32:25.221 --> 02:32:28.964]  And we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[02:32:28.964 --> 02:32:35.168]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[02:32:35.168 --> 02:32:37.750]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:42.354]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market.

[02:32:53.321 --> 02:32:54.842]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride.
[02:33:13.404 --> 02:33:14.524]  Okay, Richard Gage.
[02:33:14.524 --> 02:33:18.866]  Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth's founder.
[02:33:44.172 --> 02:33:46.693]  We got broken up by a couple breaks there.
[02:33:46.693 --> 02:34:06.321]  Recap what happened with the production company, with the television piece that just aired last week on the National Geographic Channel, and then conclude in summary exactly what you're saying here, and then I have the question to ask after you're done.
[02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:08.531]  Okay.
[02:34:08.531 --> 02:34:23.701]  So, we have NIST hiring Underwriter Laboratories to create this mock section, and they tested it according to very scientific, well, time-honored tests, and it did not fail.
[02:34:23.701 --> 02:34:26.183]  They had three different versions of this thing.
[02:34:26.183 --> 02:34:27.784]  It sagged only three inches.
[02:34:27.784 --> 02:34:28.725]  It did not fail.
[02:34:29.509 --> 02:34:29.829]  I don't
[02:34:47.116 --> 02:35:02.047]  That instead of doing something scientific like this, we have National Geographic, Robert Erickson of Creative Differences, hiring Emertek, a defense contractor, to show everybody, theoretically,
[02:35:02.427 --> 02:35:08.252]  How this building obviously fell apart?
[02:35:08.252 --> 02:35:13.296]  Well, first of all, they don't have 8-inch I-beams in the building.
[02:35:13.296 --> 02:35:19.981]  They have floor trusses, which certainly doesn't relate to any of the massive core columns in the building.
[02:35:19.981 --> 02:35:24.924]  We didn't have 500 gallons of jet fuel sitting there underneath anything.
[02:35:24.924 --> 02:35:29.088]  90% of that jet fuel was expelled and exploded outside the building.
[02:35:29.088 --> 02:35:31.930]  The rest burned up, according to the official story, in just 10 minutes.
[02:35:32.310 --> 02:35:39.758]  So all the jet fuel did was ignite a normal office fire, whose temperatures don't get to be above 12 or 1400 degrees.
[02:35:39.758 --> 02:35:44.703]  And even then, there's no evidence for temperatures over 5 or 600 degrees in the towers.
[02:35:47.526 --> 02:35:50.808]  So, this whole thing from start to finish is just ludicrous.
[02:35:50.808 --> 02:36:14.799]  And this, by the way, this I-beam is not interconnected with several other beams, like in a normal office building where the heat is conducted away from the heat source throughout the columns and beams in the building, which is really the reason why we never have had a steel frame high-rise building collapse due to fire, because of this incredible conduction ability and interconnectedness.
[02:36:14.799 --> 02:36:15.820]  It's a huge heat sink.
[02:36:18.029 --> 02:36:34.635]  This experiment and the other ones were set up to fail and manipulate the American people into thinking that this is science versus, obviously, these architects and engineers who are simply conspiracy theorists.
[02:36:35.390 --> 02:36:45.993]  But last night at the Commonwealth Club, we carefully laid out all this evidence, and he said, okay, at the end, which side is conspiracy and which side is science?
[02:36:45.993 --> 02:36:47.534]  So we have a show of hands.
[02:36:47.534 --> 02:36:48.774]  Guess what?
[02:36:48.774 --> 02:37:04.079]  90% of the 60 people who were either believers of the official theory beforehand or who were unsure, 90% of those 60 people were convinced of the evidence for explosive... Okay, to be clear, you've got 200 people,
[02:37:05.359 --> 02:37:09.461]  At this meeting, I guess you asked before who believes the official story, who doesn't.
[02:37:09.461 --> 02:37:11.141]  You're saying that's how you know it was 60 people?
[02:37:11.141 --> 02:37:13.422]  That's right.
[02:37:13.422 --> 02:37:21.205]  Okay, so they raise their hands, 60 saying, I believe the official story that 19 guys coordinated from caves in Afghanistan did this.
[02:37:21.205 --> 02:37:23.185]  Okay, great.
[02:37:23.185 --> 02:37:29.848]  And then at the end of it, you're saying 90% of those 60 people now believe the engineering, now believe your information.
[02:37:30.635 --> 02:37:44.068]  Yes, and the numbers are 20 and 40, so that there's 20 people believing the official story before, 40 who were unsure, but 90% of those, totaling 60, believed in the explosive control demolition theory afterward.
[02:37:44.068 --> 02:37:46.191]  And it's like that at every presentation, Alex.
[02:37:46.191 --> 02:37:46.811]  90%!
[02:37:46.811 --> 02:37:52.257]  And you give most of these presentations, correct me if I'm wrong, to architects and engineer groups.
[02:37:53.106 --> 02:37:54.968]  Well, I, I, not mostly.
[02:37:54.968 --> 02:37:59.792]  No, we do visit local architecture and engineering groups, and generally... Well, that's what I meant.
[02:37:59.792 --> 02:38:02.294]  You said you've made a whole mission out of... Yeah.
[02:38:02.294 --> 02:38:05.517]  I mean, how many architects and engineering groups have you talked to?
[02:38:05.517 --> 02:38:08.320]  Um, there's been about a dozen now.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:10.582]  Okay, well, what happens when you go to those?
[02:38:11.169 --> 02:38:28.284]  Oh, it's fascinating because you get people who, first of all, most of them know nothing about the third worst structural failure in modern history, building seven 47-story skyscraper collapses to its own footprint in six and a half seconds and their jaws drop.
[02:38:28.604 --> 02:38:36.587]  And by the way, NIST had always said freefall didn't happen, but then they were forced now to go ahead and say, okay, there was freefall involved.
[02:38:36.587 --> 02:38:43.749]  And they've given five, six different stories and had to recant their previous reasons that Building 7 collapsed in their own NIST reports.
[02:38:43.749 --> 02:38:44.910]  I'd like you to speak to that.
[02:38:44.910 --> 02:38:51.312]  And even National Geographic on the eve of this newest hit piece said, oh, our last
[02:38:52.290 --> 02:39:04.309]  Reasons for the towers collapsing with pancake we were wrong about that, but now we've got a new idea So they're they're the one because they say in the piece their stories never changed the government stories never changed But in truth their story continually changes
[02:39:04.818 --> 02:39:07.641]  Oh yeah, yeah, it's always changing.
[02:39:07.641 --> 02:39:22.495]  In fact, they wouldn't have changed if it weren't for members of AEN11Truth, David Chandler, a physicist, and Stephen Jones calling them publicly on their press conference, and they had to, they were forced into a corner.
[02:39:22.495 --> 02:39:25.238]  Now they have to admit that 100 feet of this building
[02:39:25.979 --> 02:39:26.740]  It's dropped.
[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:28.241]  It was in free fall.
[02:39:28.241 --> 02:39:35.150]  That's crushing 40,000 tons of structural steel at the same rate that a brick is falling off the building.
[02:39:35.150 --> 02:39:36.792]  It can't happen.
[02:39:36.792 --> 02:39:37.933]  And everybody knows that.
[02:39:37.933 --> 02:39:40.376]  And every architect and engineer we talk to knows that.
[02:39:40.376 --> 02:39:43.620]  So they end up signing our petition saying, yeah, let's get a real investigation.
[02:39:44.048 --> 02:39:48.569]  Okay, I want to go back for a moment, and we'll continue going over this, debunking them.
[02:39:48.569 --> 02:40:03.154]  The maker of the television show, who I've talked to on the phone, he's always trying to get me involved in these shows, there's several shows, JFK and 9-11, and I tell this production company, no, I know you're deceptive, you're known as the most manipulative out there, that this is your specialty, and the guy laughs.
[02:40:03.154 --> 02:40:04.114]  I'm your friend!
[02:40:04.114 --> 02:40:06.095]  No, I want to show your side!
[02:40:06.095 --> 02:40:12.037]  And the JFK thing comes out, and it's a total fraud, the most skewed to the official story I've ever seen.
[02:40:13.004 --> 02:40:20.169]  And so that's why when I was warning you, I was saying, Richard, this is, you know, months ago, when you were doing the interviews, I said, this is not a friendly piece.
[02:40:20.169 --> 02:40:21.350]  You said, no, he's listening.
[02:40:21.350 --> 02:40:22.310]  He says it's going to be in there.
[02:40:22.310 --> 02:40:23.571]  He promises.
[02:40:23.571 --> 02:40:24.712]  Have you talked to him?
[02:40:24.712 --> 02:40:29.836]  Which you now say that, you know, that you clearly, that he lied to you.
[02:40:29.836 --> 02:40:33.158]  The question here is, are you going to put a public statement out on him?
[02:40:33.158 --> 02:40:35.019]  Are you going to, have you called him?
[02:40:35.019 --> 02:40:35.860]  Have you talked to him?
[02:40:38.228 --> 02:40:43.291]  Interestingly enough, he has sent us the transcript for both of these interviews.
[02:40:43.291 --> 02:40:51.034]  So, it's clear that we have the evidence that he had all of the evidence.
[02:40:51.034 --> 02:40:52.175]  Well, you need to post that.
[02:40:52.175 --> 02:40:53.215]  You need to post that.
[02:40:53.215 --> 02:40:55.916]  In fact, I'd post the whole transcript.
[02:40:55.916 --> 02:40:57.337]  He'll claim you edited it.
[02:40:57.337 --> 02:41:02.439]  I would post that and then let everybody write about it to show he's going, oh, I promised this would be in there.
[02:41:02.439 --> 02:41:04.060]  Oh, I mean, just unbelievable.
[02:41:05.299 --> 02:41:05.859]  Oh, totally.
[02:41:05.859 --> 02:41:08.782]  When are you going to put that out then?
[02:41:08.782 --> 02:41:10.344]  We'll get it out within a week.
[02:41:10.344 --> 02:41:11.024]  Good, good.
[02:41:11.024 --> 02:41:15.168]  Well, I'm going to be in New York for the whole next week, by the way.
[02:41:15.168 --> 02:41:17.631]  We'll be at Ground Zero.
[02:41:17.631 --> 02:41:19.313]  Hopefully, you'll be there in the morning.
[02:41:19.313 --> 02:41:20.354]  Unfortunately, I can't.
[02:41:20.354 --> 02:41:24.297]  I've got a bunch of stuff I'm working on here with the Charlie Sheen developments.
[02:41:24.958 --> 02:41:25.518]  Yeah.
[02:41:25.518 --> 02:41:27.059]  Well, I'll take your place, Alex.
[02:41:27.059 --> 02:41:29.600]  I'll be out there talking to people.
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:30.680]  There'll be a lot of cameras.
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:30.920]  Good, good.
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:32.501]  You're a great leader in this fight.
[02:41:32.501 --> 02:41:43.786]  Yeah, no, I'm finishing my film, Fall of the Republic, in the next week and a half, and I am working on just absolutely piles of work, but I would love to be there with you.
[02:41:43.786 --> 02:41:48.608]  Ah, well, I'll be at the two conferences there, the We Demand Transparency conference at St.
[02:41:48.608 --> 02:41:50.769]  Mark's and the Bowery, the 11th and the 12th.
[02:41:52.452 --> 02:41:56.115]  And then Real Change Conference, the 11th and the 12th also.
[02:41:56.115 --> 02:42:01.139]  Luke Rutkowski's We Are Change group is having some great speakers as well.
[02:42:01.139 --> 02:42:07.345]  So I encourage everybody to come out to New York who can and support us and support these
[02:42:08.205 --> 02:42:14.871]  Incredible truthers who have given so much to wake up the American people.
[02:42:14.871 --> 02:42:15.671]  Well they have.
[02:42:15.671 --> 02:42:20.175]  Now run through some other bullet points.
[02:42:20.175 --> 02:42:26.360]  You were trying, we went to break, also getting into underwriting laboratories, has this internal report where in the underwriting they tested
[02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:28.381]  Fire making the building fall.
[02:42:28.381 --> 02:42:31.503]  It had to be a special building because FEMA and the command centers were there.
[02:42:31.503 --> 02:42:33.644]  They went in and even added more strength.
[02:42:33.644 --> 02:42:39.988]  This super building, CIA, Defense Intelligence, IRS, Army, FBI.
[02:42:39.988 --> 02:42:44.772]  The whole thing's a... The second biggest CIA compound outside of Langley in the U.S., they admit,
[02:42:45.788 --> 02:42:48.691]  And then magically it falls in its own footprint.
[02:42:48.691 --> 02:42:51.514]  You brought that information about underwriting laboratories to them, but they don't care.
[02:42:51.514 --> 02:43:02.365]  They went and got a steel of unknown strength, an alloy, put a big weight over it, with the white tips of the flame, the very hottest part, hitting on it long-wise.
[02:43:02.365 --> 02:43:02.946]  Just amazing.
[02:43:03.755 --> 02:43:13.261]  Yeah, and obviously it's going to fail with 3,000 pound point load right in the center span of the beam.
[02:43:13.261 --> 02:43:14.982]  It's designed to fail.
[02:43:14.982 --> 02:43:16.083]  It's designed to show.
[02:43:16.083 --> 02:43:23.427]  So when it does fail, I can imagine half of the public watching goes, oh, that's what happened to the World Trade Center.
[02:43:23.427 --> 02:43:24.768]  I see it failing.
[02:43:24.768 --> 02:43:25.869]  It's like sheep, you know?
[02:43:26.269 --> 02:43:28.190]  But the fires had almost completely burned out.
[02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:37.353]  There were people in the holes waving for help seconds before they just shatter and the building just, you know, just it's it's it's unbelievable.
[02:43:37.353 --> 02:43:43.316]  It's like watching a volcano explode and saying there was no pressure underneath it.
[02:43:43.316 --> 02:43:48.938]  In the South Tower, the fires were going out after only 56 minutes.
[02:43:48.938 --> 02:43:50.279]  According to the fire department.
[02:43:50.279 --> 02:43:51.279]  According to the fire department.
[02:43:52.341 --> 02:43:57.685]  Yeah, well, uh, Orio Palmer had reached the 78th floor and he says there's two isolated pockets of fire.
[02:43:57.685 --> 02:43:59.666]  We can put it out with two lines.
[02:43:59.666 --> 02:44:15.818]  And, uh, ten minutes later, uh, the, the, the, the, uh, hundred first responders are witnessing and documenting in their oral recordings sounds of explosions and flashes of light at the onset of the collapses, like a belt wrapping all the way around the building.
[02:44:15.818 --> 02:44:17.940]  It was as if they had detonators!
[02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:19.281]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[02:44:20.168 --> 02:44:23.249]  Yeah, that's a quote from the fireman.
[02:44:23.249 --> 02:44:38.915]  And we have news reporters on the ground 2,000 feet away from this, ducking from the incredible sounds of explosions, which we don't hear on any of the reports.
[02:44:38.915 --> 02:44:42.476]  They systematically take out the sounds of explosions.
[02:44:44.977 --> 02:44:55.882]  Well over a couple of hundred witnesses talking about these incredible explosions and then debris flying everywhere out of the sides of the Twin Towers.
[02:44:55.882 --> 02:45:00.704]  As I mentioned, 600 feet flying laterally at 50 to 70 miles an hour.
[02:45:02.878 --> 02:45:06.483]  And so, this is a gravitational collapse.
[02:45:06.483 --> 02:45:12.914]  We would expect to see 110 floors stacked up at the bottom of each of these buildings.
[02:45:12.914 --> 02:45:15.418]  Guess how many floors we see at the bottom?
[02:45:16.027 --> 02:45:18.569]  And the photographs, the videos, none!
[02:45:18.569 --> 02:45:19.610]  They're all gone!
[02:45:19.610 --> 02:45:25.334]  They've been pulverized and distributed laterally outside the building's footprint!
[02:45:25.334 --> 02:45:27.356]  This is supposed to be a gravitational collapse!
[02:45:27.356 --> 02:45:31.619]  We should have 20 to 40 stories high of floors sitting down there!
[02:45:31.619 --> 02:45:32.720]  Where are they?
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:34.061]  They're gone!
[02:45:34.061 --> 02:45:37.123]  So this is a huge problem for the official story as well.
[02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:53.910]  Well, so I explained very carefully to National Geographic what FEMA found and what FEMA documented in their Appendix C of their May of 2002 EPAT report.
[02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:54.451]  Steel.
[02:45:54.451 --> 02:45:55.511]  Two steel samples.
[02:45:55.511 --> 02:46:00.515]  By the way, the only two steel samples saved from Building 7.
[02:46:00.515 --> 02:46:09.302]  But these two steel samples, they document intergranular melting, rapid oxidation, sulfidation, and even evaporation of the ends of these beams.
[02:46:10.203 --> 02:46:12.686]  They've never seen this before.
[02:46:12.686 --> 02:46:14.027]  So how did this happen?
[02:46:14.027 --> 02:46:24.979]  And so they conclude, FEMA, that their best hypothesis as to how this building came down has only a low probability of occurrence.
[02:46:24.979 --> 02:46:26.700]  Well, what was our hypothesis?
[02:46:26.700 --> 02:46:27.902]  Fire!
[02:46:27.902 --> 02:46:32.767]  And some damage from the beams of the World Trade Center North Tower when it went down earlier that morning.
[02:46:33.467 --> 02:46:39.249]  So what happens to this entire... Oh, further research investigation is necessary.
[02:46:39.249 --> 02:46:51.834]  But unfortunately though, for those hoping to resolve the issue, all of that steel had been recycled to China, and FEMA had ordered the recycling of that steel.
[02:46:51.834 --> 02:46:59.897]  They deny this, but those who do this research end up citing FEMA for giving these orders.
[02:47:00.849 --> 02:47:02.410]  So they didn't save the steel.
[02:47:02.410 --> 02:47:08.013]  You always save the steel in any kind of a collapse so you can thoroughly understand exactly what happened.
[02:47:08.013 --> 02:47:11.876]  Now, this takes over the investigation after May of 2002.
[02:47:11.876 --> 02:47:18.019]  What did they do with this Appendix C documenting the melting of steel?
[02:47:18.019 --> 02:47:19.260]  They throw it out.
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:22.582]  It is not in the final report at all.
[02:47:22.582 --> 02:47:28.125]  In World Trade Center 7 that came out in November of just last year, seven years later,
[02:47:28.675 --> 02:47:35.279]  So, they've basically, systematically destroyed even more evidence.
[02:47:35.279 --> 02:47:39.061]  They do not want us to know about molten metal or melting of steel.
[02:47:39.061 --> 02:47:44.464]  In fact, John Gross denies the pools of molten iron, as it turns out to be.
[02:47:44.464 --> 02:47:47.526]  Stephen Jones and others analyze it, turns out to be molten iron.
[02:47:47.526 --> 02:47:50.048]  And we have all the videos of the firefighters saying it was like a...
[02:47:50.908 --> 02:47:53.289]  Foundry with molten metal running everywhere.
[02:47:53.289 --> 02:47:57.709]  We could play the clips, but they're cussing, including fire captains.
[02:47:57.709 --> 02:48:00.330]  But, I mean, it was just everywhere.
[02:48:00.330 --> 02:48:00.850]  Yeah.
[02:48:00.850 --> 02:48:01.510]  Yeah, it was.
[02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:03.911]  And there's dozens and dozens of witnesses.
[02:48:03.911 --> 02:48:06.191]  There's photographs.
[02:48:06.191 --> 02:48:10.032]  It's all in my film Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:48:10.032 --> 02:48:11.812]  The people really need to get it at Infowars.com.
[02:48:11.812 --> 02:48:15.893]  It goes through the whole history of this and the modern events, and that's how you really wake somebody up.
[02:48:15.893 --> 02:48:18.134]  I understand you're an engineer, you're an architect.
[02:48:18.134 --> 02:48:19.554]  That's an important area of research.
[02:48:20.154 --> 02:48:23.597]  I saw it, and I was very impressed by Terror Storm.
[02:48:23.597 --> 02:48:24.377]  Very impressed.
[02:48:40.689 --> 02:48:44.871]  Yeah, it's disturbing because, you know, all of this evidence is clear.
[02:48:44.871 --> 02:48:50.975]  As I mentioned to 90% of the people I talk to, they end up agreeing with us and signing our petition.
[02:48:50.975 --> 02:48:52.736]  But they say, well, what do we do now?
[02:48:52.736 --> 02:48:56.638]  And I'm going, well, we're architecture engineers.
[02:48:56.638 --> 02:48:58.038]  We can carry you this far.
[02:48:58.038 --> 02:49:02.281]  We can give you the evidence that the media, the government, has not given you.
[02:49:02.281 --> 02:49:08.144]  You can see for yourself that this points to something other than some kind of Al-Qaeda attack.
[02:49:08.944 --> 02:49:22.249]  You have got to do the research, and TerrorStorm provides an excellent background as to how these things have been systematic, as you mentioned earlier, with governments inciting wars for profit and control.
[02:49:24.210 --> 02:49:28.492]  But they want to know, well, how do we talk to people?
[02:49:28.492 --> 02:49:32.973]  Because this is a psychological problem for every American.
[02:49:32.973 --> 02:49:33.753]  Well, it is.
[02:49:33.753 --> 02:49:35.134]  Richard, we're almost out of time.
[02:49:35.134 --> 02:49:36.454]  I want you to be able to finish that last point.
[02:49:36.454 --> 02:49:38.455]  But again, have you talked to the maker?
[02:49:38.455 --> 02:49:42.176]  You've got the transcript, but have you tried to call the guy and say, you lied to me?
[02:49:42.176 --> 02:49:43.337]  Or has he taken your phone calls?
[02:49:43.894 --> 02:49:46.596]  No, he'll talk to me.
[02:49:46.596 --> 02:49:49.479]  We've emailed a couple of times.
[02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:54.063]  I have not presented him with a major confrontation at all.
[02:49:54.063 --> 02:49:57.946]  I'm trying to put my ducks in a row and now I'm packing up for New York.
[02:49:57.946 --> 02:49:59.047]  It's going to be very difficult.
[02:49:59.047 --> 02:50:00.088]  It's going to take a little bit of time.
[02:50:00.288 --> 02:50:04.651]  I understand next week you're going to get back, focus on it, have a plan, and then come out with it.
[02:50:04.651 --> 02:50:09.934]  Well, I think it's important so people, when they Google the name of this company, know who they're dealing with.
[02:50:09.934 --> 02:50:13.556]  I mean, I did some research, Tom, and was like, no way am I talking to you guys.
[02:50:13.556 --> 02:50:15.237]  Because I've been around similar people.
[02:50:15.237 --> 02:50:21.680]  When I had the History Channel people here, I knew it was a hit piece, but when they were, they said, oh, this is fair and we like you.
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:24.162]  At the end, they just laughed at me in a parking lot.
[02:50:24.162 --> 02:50:27.724]  And I had the British crew say they were being fair, and at the end,
[02:50:29.485 --> 02:50:34.810]  We went to a Chinese food restaurant and they wrote, on a fortune cookie, as a joke, they said, here, open this one, it's yours, at P.F.
[02:50:34.810 --> 02:50:37.954]  Chang's, and it said, you're dead.
[02:50:37.954 --> 02:50:40.256]  With another British crew, and then I said, is this a joke?
[02:50:40.256 --> 02:50:43.599]  And they said, whatever, we don't like you, and got up and left.
[02:50:43.599 --> 02:50:48.605]  I mean, it was just like, they wanted me at the end to know, look, we punked you, we're nasty, we're black ops.
[02:50:49.676 --> 02:50:51.557]  And we love the New World Order.
[02:50:51.557 --> 02:50:52.758]  It's just basically what it was.
[02:50:52.758 --> 02:50:53.358]  Richard, stay there.

[02:52:01.385 --> 02:52:03.386]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:52:03.386 --> 02:52:07.008]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:52:07.008 --> 02:52:09.469]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:12.530]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:52:12.530 --> 02:52:14.451]  It is essential that patriots worldwide...
[02:52:16.792 --> 02:52:17.112]  We're good.
[02:52:46.732 --> 02:52:47.133]  We're good.
[02:53:02.057 --> 02:53:11.120]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:21.024]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[02:53:58.581 --> 02:54:10.488]  U.S.
[02:54:10.488 --> 02:54:14.870]  News and World Report has the meanest hit piece I've seen by Peter Roth.
[02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:17.571]  I want to try to get him on.
[02:54:17.571 --> 02:54:19.392]  We have the former German defense minister.
[02:54:19.392 --> 02:54:21.453]  We have one of the top people in the Japanese government.
[02:54:21.453 --> 02:54:22.294]  What is he, number two or three?
[02:54:24.696 --> 02:54:32.484]  We have all these scientists, all these engineers, all these physicists, all these military people.
[02:54:33.823 --> 02:54:38.664]  All these firefighters and police, the majority of the victims' family groups, we've had them on the show.
[02:54:38.664 --> 02:54:42.665]  The heads of the groups saying the majority of our members, at least half or more, believe it's an inside job.
[02:54:42.665 --> 02:54:43.705]  That was three years ago.
[02:54:43.705 --> 02:54:47.886]  We have a New York Times poll, 94% believe the government's lying about 9-11.
[02:54:47.886 --> 02:54:53.887]  Charlie Sheen, three years ago, on CNN, 83% in their poll agreed that there was a cover-up.
[02:54:53.887 --> 02:54:55.167]  We're the majority!
[02:54:55.167 --> 02:54:59.188]  And you have this tiny cabal trying to make us feel like we're bad, we're stupid, we're evil.
[02:55:00.942 --> 02:55:05.646]  And when Charlie had this idea for 20 minutes with the President, I had no idea how big it was going to get this quick.
[02:55:05.646 --> 02:55:08.668]  I mean, it's just, it's just off the charts.
[02:55:08.668 --> 02:55:16.353]  I mean, we're talking 24 hours into this, and it is just everywhere.
[02:55:16.353 --> 02:55:19.136]  And Charlie, again, is focused.
[02:55:19.136 --> 02:55:21.457]  He has to, you know, contractual agreements.
[02:55:21.457 --> 02:55:23.699]  He wants to focus on his TV show.
[02:55:23.699 --> 02:55:27.722]  They do the rehearsal tonight, shoot it tomorrow, air it Monday.
[02:55:27.722 --> 02:55:28.382]  Two and a half men.
[02:55:29.528 --> 02:55:36.531]  But next week, he's taking time out on Friday to be here, and I've asked him, I said, go ahead and do TV now, but he wants to focus and try to do that.
[02:55:36.531 --> 02:55:41.014]  He may do some stuff on the set, he's not sure if he can duck away on TV.
[02:55:41.014 --> 02:55:43.115]  I've told him, go for it.
[02:55:43.115 --> 02:55:50.538]  National TV is in the works, and a lot of other stuff, and some other things behind the scenes that I don't even want to get into.
[02:55:50.538 --> 02:55:55.321]  I'll let Charlie talk about it on Friday if he wants to, but God, he's got a lot of courage.
[02:55:55.321 --> 02:55:56.141]  Man, this is real.
[02:55:56.141 --> 02:55:57.562]  I can't believe I'm going up against these people.
[02:55:58.581 --> 02:56:02.264]  But I mean, you can't back off when you know they're murderers and did this.
[02:56:02.264 --> 02:56:05.347]  Richard Gage, in closing, you're going to be in New York speaking twice.
[02:56:05.347 --> 02:56:08.510]  People can find out more at Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:56:08.510 --> 02:56:09.972]  What's the best website?
[02:56:09.972 --> 02:56:14.596]  Yeah, it's AE911Truth.org.
[02:56:14.596 --> 02:56:16.258]  Stands for Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:56:16.258 --> 02:56:16.698]  AE911Truth.org.
[02:56:19.846 --> 02:56:23.930]  And I think, by the way, Alex, National Geographic did us a favor.
[02:56:23.930 --> 02:56:35.921]  That hit base was so bad that even thinking people will see the major, obvious attempt to slander the truth movement and actually look at it and find out what the heck's going on.
[02:56:36.061 --> 02:56:44.743]  And that weird woman's voice, that weird woman's voice going, truth is... Then when she talked about the other people, she had a normal tone.
[02:56:44.743 --> 02:56:47.603]  And it was like a snake voiced it or something.
[02:56:47.603 --> 02:56:49.403]  And it's just an absolute travesty.
[02:56:49.403 --> 02:56:52.884]  Do me a favor, I'm going to let you go, Mr. Gage, we appreciate your time.
[02:56:52.884 --> 02:56:59.365]  Contact me in a week or so, when you're ready to release those transcripts of what really happened in the interviews, where he's promising he's going to put that out.
[02:56:59.365 --> 02:57:03.246]  I'd like to have you on the air to expose that, to just show the deception.
[02:57:03.246 --> 02:57:04.106]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:57:04.659 --> 02:57:05.359]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:05.359 --> 02:57:06.300]  We'll see you on the road.
[02:57:15.734 --> 02:57:17.595]  I haven't really even thanked any of my sponsors today.
[02:57:17.595 --> 02:57:19.837]  We're coming up with Professor Steven Jones at 8 after.
[02:57:19.837 --> 02:57:22.939]  I want to hit some World Bank news, World Government news.
[02:57:22.939 --> 02:57:25.040]  I mean, just look at this McClatchy Newspapers.
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:27.502]  But I wanted to zoom in on that while I'm plugging this.
[02:57:27.502 --> 02:57:29.363]  I want to tell you about eFoodsDirect.
[02:57:29.363 --> 02:57:31.044]  This is the best storable foods company I've found.
[02:57:31.044 --> 02:57:33.286]  I bought from three or four other places samples.
[02:57:33.286 --> 02:57:38.369]  One big load had MSG in it, genetically modified, packaged in foreign countries.
[02:57:38.369 --> 02:57:42.432]  Well, that is not the case, ladies and gentlemen, with eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:57:42.432 --> 02:57:45.314]  And they're the biggest outfit out there and the longest continually operating.
[02:57:46.214 --> 02:57:46.294]  Yes.
[02:58:01.243 --> 02:58:07.106]  If we do turn into Argentina like the Associated Press has Top Economist saying we are, you're gonna need to have storable food.
[02:58:07.106 --> 02:58:08.106]  I hope that's not the case!
[02:58:19.505 --> 02:58:20.546]  Maybe we can stop it.
[02:58:20.546 --> 02:58:22.147]  The point is, it's an insurance policy.
[02:58:22.147 --> 02:58:25.510]  Eatfoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:58:25.510 --> 02:58:32.756]  Don't forget also, I've been so busy I've been plugging the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com with all the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the ball caps.
[02:58:32.756 --> 02:58:33.957]  That funds our operation.
[02:58:33.957 --> 02:58:36.099]  We need your support if you believe in what we're doing.
[02:58:36.099 --> 02:58:43.665]  Make a purchase of the great information today at InfoWars.com or subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:58:51.701 --> 02:58:54.704]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.704 --> 02:59:00.049]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:00.049 --> 02:59:02.091]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:02.091 --> 02:59:07.096]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.096 --> 02:59:08.017]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.257 --> 02:59:09.378]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.378 --> 02:59:11.279]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.279 --> 02:59:12.340]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.340 --> 02:59:14.541]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.541 --> 02:59:15.882]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.882 --> 02:59:17.423]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.423 --> 02:59:22.686]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.686 --> 02:59:26.269]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.269 --> 02:59:29.731]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.091 --> 02:59:31.312]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.312 --> 02:59:32.213]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.213 --> 02:59:33.314]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.314 --> 02:59:34.254]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.254 --> 02:59:35.335]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.335 --> 02:59:38.398]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.398 --> 02:59:38.918]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.918 --> 02:59:40.600]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:41.600]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.600 --> 02:59:42.781]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.781 --> 02:59:44.623]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:07.502 --> 03:00:10.653]  The best of times, the worst of times.
[03:00:10.653 --> 03:00:11.475]  So much happening.
[03:00:12.466 --> 03:00:15.668]  For those that don't know, we had Charlie Sheen live on today with us.
[03:00:15.668 --> 03:00:20.390]  We also aired that 21-minute interview I did a few weeks ago at his home.
[03:00:20.390 --> 03:00:27.774]  A video interview I did with him is going to be airing tomorrow and he'll be live with us on the air again Friday for 9-11.
[03:00:27.774 --> 03:00:36.779]  And he's going public for the 9-11 families who've called for a new investigation for the six 9-11 Commission members of the ten that come out and said it's a fraud, a lie, a hoax.
[03:00:38.300 --> 03:00:43.562]  We're doing this because we want to get the truth out and want our children to live in a free country and a free society.
[03:00:43.562 --> 03:00:45.503]  Hitler used stage terror to get control.
[03:00:45.503 --> 03:00:47.744]  Stalin and Lenin did it to expand control.
[03:00:47.744 --> 03:00:48.304]  Mao did it.
[03:00:48.304 --> 03:00:50.665]  The Tsars did it.
[03:00:50.665 --> 03:00:54.747]  So many other governments do it and the criminals running our nation are doing it.
[03:00:54.747 --> 03:00:57.108]  And people need to face those facts and demand the truth.
[03:00:58.069 --> 03:01:03.614]  Professor Stephen Jones is going to be coming on in about 30-35 minutes, and I am going to hit all this World Bank, World Government news.
[03:01:03.614 --> 03:01:05.615]  Let me just hit on some of it now, but I want to be honest.
[03:01:05.615 --> 03:01:11.900]  I want to dig into my stack from yesterday that was taken off my table, which is good.
[03:01:11.900 --> 03:01:13.422]  The guys clean up my pigsty in here.
[03:01:13.422 --> 03:01:18.045]  It gets really messy, but I had a bunch of articles in my stack.
[03:01:18.045 --> 03:01:26.873]  Oh, here's yesterday's stack, where they're openly announcing Argentine-style collapse for the United States.
[03:01:29.102 --> 03:01:40.988]  And where all of this is coming out, and so I'm going to go over that, and when Professor Jones leaves us, I'm going to cover that in great detail.
[03:01:40.988 --> 03:01:42.808]  But, I mean, here's one from today.
[03:01:42.808 --> 03:01:47.150]  A year after financial crisis, a new world order emerges.
[03:01:47.150 --> 03:01:47.931]  And then here's another one.
[03:01:47.931 --> 03:01:49.471]  Obama to seal U.S.-U.N.
[03:01:49.471 --> 03:01:50.632]  relationship, the first U.S.
[03:01:50.632 --> 03:01:54.694]  president to be a president, and the head of the International Security Council.
[03:01:55.831 --> 03:02:03.835]  And he's also the head of the National Security Council here that runs the FEMA camps, Homeland Security, the 400,000 troops the Army openly says they're going to put on the streets of America.
[03:02:03.835 --> 03:02:15.861]  They're doing acclimation drills everywhere, running checkpoints for PR things that they think the public will buy, helping people at car wrecks with the Jaws of Life, searching people for alcohol and drugs.
[03:02:15.861 --> 03:02:16.642]  Totally illegal!
[03:02:16.642 --> 03:02:18.543]  Regular Army, regular Marines, confirmed.
[03:02:20.230 --> 03:02:23.733]  I mean, the establishment really wants to take over so they can loot and rob the country.
[03:02:23.733 --> 03:02:28.757]  It's like when a bank robber comes in, says, hands up, tells the security guard, drop your gun, put your hands up.
[03:02:28.757 --> 03:02:30.058]  I mean, they want our guns.
[03:02:30.058 --> 03:02:30.879]  They're saying, hands up.
[03:02:30.879 --> 03:02:32.080]  They've introduced the bills to do it.
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:34.502]  They are saying, hands up with the army.
[03:02:34.502 --> 03:02:37.425]  The good news is the army's full of a lot of good, awake people.
[03:02:38.662 --> 03:02:39.303]  In many respects.
[03:02:39.303 --> 03:02:42.325]  Though they're hiring a lot of illegal aliens and foreigners and criminals.
[03:02:42.325 --> 03:02:43.966]  Now, that's pretty scary.
[03:02:43.966 --> 03:02:47.428]  It's kind of like what the government did shipping in the drugs in the 70s and 80s in Miami.
[03:02:47.428 --> 03:02:53.492]  I was watching a documentary, Cocaine Cowboys, about that jogging on the treadmill this morning.
[03:02:53.492 --> 03:02:59.716]  And it had everything I already knew, but there it was in video with the police saying it, admitting it.
[03:02:59.716 --> 03:03:04.980]  And because of the crime wave, they then got rid of all the rules.
[03:03:04.980 --> 03:03:06.141]  Police could be drug users.
[03:03:06.946 --> 03:03:07.747]  And be on the force.
[03:03:07.747 --> 03:03:14.514]  And police, then it turned out, it said a whole new, the entire new class got killed or went to prison.
[03:03:14.514 --> 03:03:22.862]  The program shows cops saying the entire new class, I think I said of like 1980, 81, I forget, in the film, all died or went to prison.
[03:03:22.862 --> 03:03:24.123]  They were all dealing drugs.
[03:03:24.123 --> 03:03:27.527]  Of course, I mean, it's a $500 million a year industry in the US alone.
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:37.587]  And you can launder that money so it has that multiple value of the fact that they can launder it and the banks can loan out ten times every dollar they've got.
[03:03:37.587 --> 03:03:43.913]  And then the BBC just calmly admits the US is guarding their poppy fields but so the Taliban doesn't get it.
[03:03:43.913 --> 03:03:46.034]  And then you see opium production go up
[03:03:47.089 --> 03:03:50.932]  10, 11, 12 fold last time I checked from the liberation of Afghanistan.
[03:03:50.932 --> 03:03:55.655]  It's about controlling opium, which is another 500 billion globally.
[03:03:55.655 --> 03:03:59.958]  Produces over 80% of the world's opium that's turned into heroin.
[03:03:59.958 --> 03:04:02.900]  So it's just pouring out of there.
[03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:02.980]  And
[03:04:04.431 --> 03:04:13.280]  Then I hear local police, one local cop's got a radio show and he's a nice guy, I've met him, but he gets on air and says, I just can't believe that officers would deal drugs.
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:14.862]  I can't believe the government would deal drugs.
[03:04:14.862 --> 03:04:15.883]  What are you talking about?
[03:04:15.883 --> 03:04:17.605]  Serpico, all of it, LAPD.
[03:04:17.605 --> 03:04:26.014]  I mean, how many times have the police and the government, the CIA, how many times have CIA aircraft crashed full of cocaine and heroin?
[03:04:27.352 --> 03:04:29.653]  And then they put people in jail if they get caught using it.
[03:04:29.653 --> 03:04:31.274]  I mean, it's a sick joke.
[03:04:31.274 --> 03:04:33.895]  We have to admit the government ships in the drugs.
[03:04:33.895 --> 03:04:35.895]  We have to admit they're staging the terror.
[03:04:35.895 --> 03:04:38.016]  So they can then set up the police state.
[03:04:38.016 --> 03:04:39.877]  Then they got the military involved in the war on drugs.
[03:04:39.877 --> 03:04:42.078]  Now they're going to use the military on the American people.
[03:04:42.078 --> 03:04:43.959]  They got the military involved in fighting Al-Qaeda.
[03:04:43.959 --> 03:04:49.241]  Now they say, oh, Homeland Security document that we broke says we're going to use the Army against you.
[03:04:49.241 --> 03:04:55.023]  And then we get sent secret documents and they break in mainstream news where the Army's watching me, Ron Paul, and others.
[03:04:55.023 --> 03:04:56.784]  I mean, the Army is watching me?
[03:04:57.344 --> 03:04:58.805]  What for?
[03:04:58.805 --> 03:05:01.087]  I'm calling for peaceful liberation!
[03:05:01.087 --> 03:05:06.391]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:05:06.391 --> 03:05:10.934]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:05:10.934 --> 03:05:13.196]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:05:13.196 --> 03:05:14.817]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:05:14.817 --> 03:05:15.858]  There is a solution.
[03:05:16.098 --> 03:05:24.524]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:06:01.993 --> 03:06:04.475]  It is a big idea.
[03:06:04.475 --> 03:06:06.737]  A new world order in the near future.
[03:06:08.050 --> 03:06:11.113]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:06:11.113 --> 03:06:13.956]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:06:13.956 --> 03:06:16.739]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:06:16.739 --> 03:06:19.922]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:06:19.922 --> 03:06:27.249]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:06:30.267 --> 03:06:35.711]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:06:35.711 --> 03:06:39.593]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:06:39.593 --> 03:06:42.155]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:06:42.155 --> 03:06:43.316]  Most people have no idea.
[03:06:43.316 --> 03:06:44.096]  They're not after money.
[03:06:44.096 --> 03:06:45.377]  They have all the money they need.
[03:06:45.377 --> 03:06:46.358]  They're after power.
[03:06:46.358 --> 03:06:47.519]  That's what they're after.

[03:06:57.005 --> 03:06:59.026]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:06:59.026 --> 03:07:00.187]  You have been warned.
[03:07:00.887 --> 03:07:09.594]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:07:09.594 --> 03:07:15.579]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[03:07:15.579 --> 03:07:22.104]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[03:07:22.665 --> 03:07:26.066]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:07:26.066 --> 03:07:28.507]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[03:08:02.535 --> 03:08:08.137]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:31.940 --> 03:08:39.289]  We've got Professor Stephen Jones coming up here in just a moment with us.
[03:08:39.289 --> 03:08:43.093]  I do want to tell you about one more of the sponsors that has made today's show possible.
[03:08:43.093 --> 03:08:43.694]  Maybe several.
[03:08:43.694 --> 03:08:48.399]  I tend to not get to these until the end of the show and they're so incredibly important.
[03:08:48.399 --> 03:08:49.441]  One of them is a Kola Blue.
[03:08:50.578 --> 03:08:53.781]  This is just an amazingly high-quality atmospheric water generator.
[03:08:53.781 --> 03:08:54.802]  Well, they've got a whole line of them.
[03:08:54.802 --> 03:08:55.482]  They've got huge ones.
[03:08:55.482 --> 03:08:56.703]  They sell to governments and militaries.
[03:08:56.703 --> 03:08:58.185]  They have a small one for the home.
[03:08:58.185 --> 03:09:02.268]  Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top of it.
[03:09:02.268 --> 03:09:14.518]  It grabs water out of the air from panels in the back, puts it through seven filters, including reverse osmosis and carbon, and then has a UV antibacterial light in the stainless steel tank inside.
[03:09:15.427 --> 03:09:19.590]  The Acola Blue 28 machine will allow you to get off the grid.
[03:09:19.590 --> 03:09:20.811]  You can even get solar panels.
[03:09:20.811 --> 03:09:24.613]  They sell a converter that goes with it that works just for their machine if you have solar.
[03:09:24.613 --> 03:09:26.795]  Very inexpensive to get that converter.
[03:09:26.795 --> 03:09:28.075]  Acolablue.com.
[03:09:28.075 --> 03:09:31.278]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[03:09:31.278 --> 03:09:32.438]  Acolablue.com.
[03:09:32.438 --> 03:09:35.440]  Big banners up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:09:35.440 --> 03:09:36.201]  Or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[03:09:36.201 --> 03:09:36.281]  800-691-6043.
[03:09:36.281 --> 03:09:37.282]  Acolablue.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:46.628 --> 03:09:51.392]  The Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or office.
[03:09:51.392 --> 03:10:00.219]  Going now to Professor Stephen Jones, who four years ago, now, How Time Flies, went public.
[03:10:00.219 --> 03:10:07.045]  Stephen Jones, a retired professor of physics, has published papers in Scientific American, Nature, and Physical Review Letters.
[03:10:07.045 --> 03:10:11.589]  His peer-reviewed papers on the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, all three of them.
[03:10:13.127 --> 03:10:18.210]  When only two were hit by airplanes is being widely read and has been translated into Spanish, French, and Japanese.
[03:10:18.210 --> 03:10:25.775]  It's available at the journal of 911studies.com along with 26 other scholarly letters regarding the events of 9-11-2001.
[03:10:25.775 --> 03:10:38.323]  His ongoing research includes experiments with thermites along with electron microscope energy spectrographic analysis of dust and slag from the WTC.
[03:10:39.594 --> 03:10:41.395]  And we really appreciate him coming on.
[03:10:41.395 --> 03:10:48.821]  He's here today to debunk the debunkers who lied to Gage and said, oh, we're going to show you talking about this evidence.
[03:10:48.821 --> 03:10:51.042]  Showed him a rough cut and said this will be in the show.
[03:10:51.042 --> 03:10:53.744]  They have transcripts of that now, proving it.
[03:10:53.744 --> 03:10:55.105]  They gave him the transcripts.
[03:10:55.105 --> 03:10:59.048]  This same group is known for doing hit pieces on, quote, conspiracy theorists.
[03:10:59.048 --> 03:11:00.209]  It's their specialty.
[03:11:00.209 --> 03:11:02.190]  Creative Differences is the name.
[03:11:02.190 --> 03:11:03.752]  And they also did this ridiculous thermite
[03:11:04.352 --> 03:11:09.476]  I mean, I've seen thermite tests where they put a cup of it over on an engine block, and it melts right through in seconds.
[03:11:09.476 --> 03:11:17.083]  I've seen... But this thermite barely even sparked, but just for a few seconds, saying there were hundreds of pounds on it.
[03:11:17.083 --> 03:11:24.389]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen... And then they acted like explosive thermite didn't exist, nano-thermite, super-thermite.
[03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:27.632]  I mean, this was crazy, when we have all the patents and the rest of it.
[03:11:27.632 --> 03:11:29.594]  So I wanted to get Professor Stephen Jones on with us.
[03:11:29.594 --> 03:11:30.595]  Professor, it's great to have you.
[03:11:31.144 --> 03:11:31.704]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:11:31.704 --> 03:11:35.486]  It's great to be with you again here today.
[03:11:35.486 --> 03:11:37.547]  Okay, briefly recap.
[03:11:37.547 --> 03:11:48.232]  Most people know who you are, but for those that don't, how you got into this, and then let's get into Thermite, the different samples, what it shows, how it fits with the NIST report, fits with the firefighter testimony.
[03:11:48.232 --> 03:11:49.432]  Break it down, sir.
[03:11:49.432 --> 03:11:51.773]  Okay, sure.
[03:11:51.773 --> 03:11:56.596]  Well, to begin, let me start with the Journal of 9-1-1 Studies that you mentioned.
[03:11:56.596 --> 03:11:58.056]  We now have over 100 papers and letters.
[03:12:00.250 --> 03:12:02.612]  So, the list has grown dramatically.
[03:12:02.612 --> 03:12:06.715]  These are all peer-reviewed, and I encourage people to go there.
[03:12:06.715 --> 03:12:26.811]  Of course, we also have the papers that you mentioned in more established scientific journals, technical journals, civil engineering journals, and, of course, the Open Chemical Physics Journal has our latest paper with Neil Tarrant, Jeff Ferrer, myself, and a total of nine authors, I think.
[03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:35.800]  Let's see, my other phone was ringing, Alex, sorry.
[03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:37.961]  That's okay, sir, go ahead.
[03:12:37.961 --> 03:12:54.244]  So, yeah, it's been quite an adventure trying to explain to people the difference between nanothermite or superthermite, same thing there, compared to ordinary macrothermite.
[03:12:54.244 --> 03:13:01.926]  And I'll tell you, I explained that very carefully to the National Geographic people, and they did get some of that straight, but
[03:13:02.714 --> 03:13:14.158]  You just couldn't seem to bring it, to admit that, you know, here's a form of thermite that's nano thermite that's distinctly different from ordinary thermite.
[03:13:14.158 --> 03:13:21.060]  And the nano thermite is explosive, can be tailored to be a high explosive.
[03:13:21.060 --> 03:13:23.881]  And they just, they just didn't do it.
[03:13:23.881 --> 03:13:28.463]  And then, of course, this test they did, you mentioned that, where they piled up ordinary thermite.
[03:13:28.463 --> 03:13:29.823]  They didn't even put sulfur in it.
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:36.003]  That would have been interesting if they'd done at least that, which I talk about in my first paper.
[03:13:36.003 --> 03:13:44.668]  And you and I talked about thermate, which is the sulfur added to thermite, at some length, explaining the difference.
[03:13:44.668 --> 03:13:55.295]  And of course, the sulfur observed in samples of World Trade Center steel, observed by the guys at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and published.
[03:13:55.295 --> 03:14:00.258]  That great mystery, the New York Times said, how did the sulfur get in the steel?
[03:14:03.201 --> 03:14:11.163]  Sorry, clearing my throat a little here, but yeah, so they didn't even add sulfur, and of course they didn't test nanothermite at all.
[03:14:11.163 --> 03:14:22.345]  And they kept saying, I just was reviewing that this morning, the NatGeo program, and they kept saying, well, thermite is not explosive, will not explode.
[03:14:22.345 --> 03:14:30.647]  Well, excuse me, there is a form called nanothermite that will explode, and so, you know, they
[03:14:31.431 --> 03:14:34.814]  Totally obfuscated that important point.
[03:14:34.814 --> 03:14:37.256]  And, you know, I kept hammering that.
[03:14:37.256 --> 03:14:42.180]  They did quote me on that in that program briefly.
[03:14:42.180 --> 03:14:50.887]  But, of course, their test had nothing to do with what we're talking about in the nanothermite paper.
[03:14:50.887 --> 03:14:51.948]  Nothing whatsoever.
[03:14:51.948 --> 03:14:53.609]  No correlation at all.
[03:14:53.609 --> 03:15:00.495]  And I told them, I was really upset when I heard about that in March, that they're proposing this, well,
[03:15:00.865 --> 03:15:04.668]  When I proposed it, I had already done the experiment.
[03:15:04.668 --> 03:15:05.769]  I called it pathetic.
[03:15:05.769 --> 03:15:13.936]  I said, this in no way represents my views to stack up a bunch of ordinary thermite around a steel column.
[03:15:13.936 --> 03:15:16.398]  I never said anything like that.
[03:15:16.398 --> 03:15:22.363]  We're talking about nanothermite in this paper, and thermate, which is sulfur added to thermite.
[03:15:22.363 --> 03:15:24.965]  It looks like that was also present.
[03:15:24.965 --> 03:15:28.848]  Good evidence for that was the sulfur in the World Trade Center steel sample.
[03:15:29.997 --> 03:15:39.121]  But to do it with ordinary thermite and the way they did it is just ludicrous and of course I told them it's a straw man argument.
[03:15:39.121 --> 03:15:47.005]  It supposedly represents my views but in no way comes close to what I have stated.
[03:15:48.319 --> 03:16:11.608]  Well, I want to get into the science with you, Professor, today, but first, did they hold out in a dishonest way to you in the way Richard Gage, who I think has the highest credibility, I mean, he doesn't like to get in fights, he doesn't like to be nasty, he puts up with a lot of crap, he's a genteel person, scholarly like yourself, but I mean, he said this was a complete lie, a complete deception, a complete fraud.
[03:16:11.608 --> 03:16:16.490]  Well, you know, I think that there are certainly some elements there.
[03:16:17.062 --> 03:16:22.324]  That I would have to say that Nat Geo was disingenuous.
[03:16:22.324 --> 03:16:32.388]  I mean, I said, look, NIST just can't seem to admit that there is a form of thermite, nanothermite, that is explosive.
[03:16:32.388 --> 03:16:37.070]  I hope you can get that straight and tell the facts.
[03:16:37.070 --> 03:16:41.432]  This is what we're claiming now is nanothermite was the main culprit here.
[03:16:42.037 --> 03:16:49.083]  Oh yeah, they say repeatedly, they don't even know if it exists, even though you have all the patents and NASA uses it, missile separation.
[03:16:49.083 --> 03:16:58.530]  I mean, it just so happens the Pentagon has a lot, and their scientists just so happen to have those patents, and you've got a bunch of NIST experts that are the few in the world on it, but no big deal.
[03:16:58.530 --> 03:17:11.481]  And you know, there's data published, as we quoted in our NanoThermite paper, we published from Livermore National Laboratory, for example, Tillotson and Gash and those
[03:17:12.216 --> 03:17:13.037]  We're good to go.
[03:17:35.816 --> 03:17:39.359]  Complex mix of ultra ultra fine.
[03:17:39.359 --> 03:17:44.944]  This is very exotic and from sample after sample after sample, you find the same signature.
[03:17:44.944 --> 03:17:46.586]  That's exactly right.
[03:17:46.586 --> 03:17:58.937]  And so for them to obscure all that, particularly after my, actually I was just pleading with Robert Erickson to please get this straight.
[03:17:58.937 --> 03:18:01.740]  NIST can't seem to admit it, but surely you can.
[03:18:02.793 --> 03:18:09.178]  That there's a difference between incendiary thermite and explosive nanothermite.
[03:18:09.178 --> 03:18:12.560]  There's a difference between night and day, you know?
[03:18:12.560 --> 03:18:16.023]  And sure enough, they obscured it again.
[03:18:16.023 --> 03:18:20.946]  And so yes, I must say, that does seem disingenuous to me.
[03:18:20.946 --> 03:18:22.728]  I don't see how you can say it otherwise.
[03:18:23.550 --> 03:18:37.174]  Well, I know you don't get into the Pentagon, but firing missiles into fiberglass chicken coops, and I recognize that's what it looked like out of a farm supply, a fiberglass little thin thing and blowing it up with a pound of plastic explosive and saying a missile would have blown the whole Pentagon up.
[03:18:37.174 --> 03:18:41.815]  I mean, this was, this was just, I mean, I was watching this and I couldn't believe it.
[03:18:41.815 --> 03:18:45.656]  And they would go, the science, the truthers.
[03:18:45.656 --> 03:18:51.898]  And they would like, off the page, have it all crooked, the word truther, even on your name tags to make you look right.
[03:18:52.538 --> 03:18:58.785]  And they wouldn't have the camera shots as nice with you guys, but with their experts they would.
[03:18:58.785 --> 03:19:02.028]  We had History Channel do this to us.
[03:19:02.028 --> 03:19:05.592]  They would do stuff like, I would give a speech to a stand alone crowd of 600 people.
[03:19:07.011 --> 03:19:07.571]  Yep.
[03:19:07.571 --> 03:19:07.852]  Uh-huh.
[03:19:07.852 --> 03:19:07.992]  Yep.
[03:19:28.871 --> 03:19:29.852]  He's not popular.
[03:19:29.852 --> 03:19:31.234]  That's what Psychology Today did.
[03:19:31.234 --> 03:19:32.875]  They said Alex had no friends.
[03:19:32.875 --> 03:19:35.698]  You know, basically Alex says he had friends, but we couldn't prove it.
[03:19:35.698 --> 03:19:39.342]  Alex said he has a good family life, but he wouldn't let us talk to his family.
[03:19:39.342 --> 03:19:43.647]  You know, when I have a great family life and great friends and great high school.
[03:19:43.647 --> 03:19:44.728]  It's a little too wild.
[03:19:44.728 --> 03:19:47.230]  It was a little too fun.
[03:19:47.230 --> 03:19:48.892]  You know, but...
[03:19:50.672 --> 03:19:56.261]  I mean, again, it's meant to sell the idea that we're like these outcast kooks when we are the majority.
[03:19:56.261 --> 03:19:57.644]  Professor Stephen Jones, stay with us.
[03:19:57.644 --> 03:20:02.351]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[03:20:02.351 --> 03:20:03.774]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[03:20:03.774 --> 03:20:05.076]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[03:20:05.461 --> 03:20:07.282]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[03:20:07.282 --> 03:20:12.183]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[03:20:12.183 --> 03:20:17.205]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[03:21:01.604 --> 03:21:05.488]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[03:21:05.488 --> 03:21:15.657]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[03:21:25.366 --> 03:21:27.508]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[03:21:27.928 --> 03:21:33.136]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[03:21:53.613 --> 03:21:57.134]  Again, go to 5starsoap.com and just try their products.
[03:21:57.134 --> 03:21:58.114]  You're going to love them.
[03:21:58.114 --> 03:22:01.935]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:22:01.935 --> 03:22:08.896]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[03:22:09.758 --> 03:22:10.960]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:22:10.960 --> 03:22:18.029]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:22:18.029 --> 03:22:26.541]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:22:26.909 --> 03:22:34.010]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:22:34.010 --> 03:22:37.171]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:22:37.171 --> 03:22:42.952]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:22:42.952 --> 03:22:46.033]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:22:46.033 --> 03:22:53.014]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[03:22:55.691 --> 03:22:56.031]  We're good to go.
[03:23:02.088 --> 03:23:09.613]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:23:09.613 --> 03:23:14.116]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:23:14.116 --> 03:23:19.260]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[03:23:19.260 --> 03:23:26.725]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:23:26.725 --> 03:23:31.108]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[03:23:31.408 --> 03:23:37.433]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:23:37.433 --> 03:23:44.359]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:23:44.359 --> 03:23:49.864]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision dot com.
[03:23:49.864 --> 03:23:52.406]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[03:23:53.086 --> 03:23:53.507]  269-409-1776 today!
[03:24:01.308 --> 03:24:04.910]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:11.435]  Would you stand tall and strong if you saw all the things that were wrong?
[03:24:11.435 --> 03:24:14.537]  Well, Professor Stephen A. Jones did.
[03:24:30.322 --> 03:24:36.825]  Kind of like Galileo saying that the earth orbited the sun, not the sun orbiting the earth.
[03:24:36.825 --> 03:24:39.286]  And the truth is coming out and the system is scared.
[03:24:39.286 --> 03:24:50.270]  Professor Jones, do you agree with me that, or give us your take on this, that we see all these new hit pieces coming out now because they understand 9-11 truth has just continued to grow and didn't go away.
[03:24:50.270 --> 03:24:53.512]  It wasn't just a political thing of bashing Bush.
[03:24:53.512 --> 03:24:56.153]  That staged terror is something that people really understand now.
[03:24:57.941 --> 03:25:00.022]  I do agree with you there, Alex.
[03:25:00.022 --> 03:25:05.023]  I think that we are making progress worldwide, not just the United States.
[03:25:05.023 --> 03:25:12.785]  I mean, Neil Herrod, Professor Herrod in Denmark, gets calls from all over.
[03:25:12.785 --> 03:25:17.547]  He told me that he's been in the media a great deal in Europe.
[03:25:17.547 --> 03:25:21.788]  So I know that in Europe, people are waking up, including Russia.
[03:25:22.472 --> 03:25:24.413]  Of course, and other countries.
[03:25:24.413 --> 03:25:50.166]  In this country, it seems like every September 11th, we're coming up again, two days, and we get this burst of interest, which is good, but like you say, like the Nat Geo program, we get this mocking, basically, calling us truthers, and look at these guys' psychology, you know, psychoanalyzing us, that we're so paranoid.
[03:25:50.166 --> 03:25:51.467]  I mean, that was the term they used.
[03:25:53.495 --> 03:25:56.296]  As if we can't do science.
[03:25:56.296 --> 03:26:04.739]  That's the beauty of science, as I've repeated, Alex, is that anyone, regardless of belief system, can get the same result.
[03:26:04.739 --> 03:26:16.944]  If anyone will take a dare here, look at the World Trade Center dust, you will see these chips that are red on one side, gray on the other, very distinctive.
[03:26:16.944 --> 03:26:19.965]  Then do the test that we did, and you'll get the same result.
[03:26:20.305 --> 03:26:24.767]  Yeah, you're finding the nanothermite, I mean itself, unignited.
[03:26:24.767 --> 03:26:31.630]  There was one issue that had any credibility, the one shred watching the program several times that I thought had any basis.
[03:26:32.884 --> 03:26:35.085]  Was this claim, well, your chain of custody.
[03:26:35.085 --> 03:26:41.087]  But you have FEMA coming in two days after, locking it down, saying federal crime to even take photos.
[03:26:41.087 --> 03:26:49.189]  They cut up the steel, shipped it off, but you and others were able to go to the different states and cities that have gotten it, you know, to build memorials with it.
[03:26:49.189 --> 03:26:52.470]  You were able to get it from people that owned homes or apartments nearby where it was still wrecked.
[03:26:52.470 --> 03:26:52.690]  Right.
[03:26:52.690 --> 03:26:56.972]  I mean, speak to that, because you've got a bunch of different places you've gotten this.
[03:26:58.154 --> 03:26:59.415]  Absolutely.
[03:26:59.415 --> 03:27:03.478]  We've studied in detail six samples now, if I count correctly.
[03:27:03.478 --> 03:27:15.286]  Four are reported in the paper, but we've been looking at more samples, and they all have the same signature of the red-gray material, these chips that still blow up.
[03:27:15.286 --> 03:27:19.929]  The red material side blows up after all these years.
[03:27:19.929 --> 03:27:23.151]  And let me say, in the paper we make an effort
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:37.284]  To spell out the chain of custody for those samples that were reported on in the paper, we pointed out the distinct chemical similarity, the chemical signatures being the same in all four samples.
[03:27:37.284 --> 03:27:42.145]  So, really, the basis of maybe someone could... What could it be?
[03:27:42.145 --> 03:27:44.646]  They salted these samples?
[03:27:44.646 --> 03:27:49.687]  How could they reach these independent collectors and New York citizens?
[03:27:50.878 --> 03:27:56.964]  Who did save some of the dust, and I've heard of others since, and I had a call this morning, another fellow had saved some dust.
[03:27:56.964 --> 03:28:02.729]  So, you know, people were saving it as a souvenir, nothing else.
[03:28:02.729 --> 03:28:09.955]  And to suppose that they salted these is, now that's really stretching credulity.
[03:28:09.955 --> 03:28:12.757]  So I haven't heard that argument too much recently.
[03:28:12.757 --> 03:28:18.282]  The one argument I have heard recently, Alex, is, well, Professor Eager.
[03:28:20.112 --> 03:28:20.792]  He'll find anything.
[03:28:20.792 --> 03:28:23.474]  He didn't complain about the chain of custody.
[03:28:23.474 --> 03:28:24.315]  He was complaining.
[03:28:24.315 --> 03:28:27.797]  He said, well, this has got to be primer paint.
[03:28:27.797 --> 03:28:30.960]  Just paint that was put on the steel and it's not explosive at all.
[03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:33.582]  It's just paint, you know, ordinary primer paint.
[03:28:33.582 --> 03:28:39.346]  Well, we found a sample of steel.
[03:28:39.346 --> 03:28:46.011]  This is actually at a memorial in, uh, at Clarkson College in New York State.
[03:28:46.011 --> 03:28:47.072]  Like I say, there are these, uh,
[03:28:48.119 --> 03:28:52.281]  Samples around and this one happens to be a Clarkson.
[03:28:52.281 --> 03:28:56.183]  I contacted an individual who lives nearby.
[03:28:56.183 --> 03:29:02.466]  She contacted the fellow that actually put the memorial together.
[03:29:02.466 --> 03:29:04.367]  He does welding.
[03:29:04.367 --> 03:29:05.908]  So he put that together.
[03:29:05.908 --> 03:29:16.333]  He collected for us, for her and then she sent it to us, a sample right off the steel of the actual primer paint that was still on
[03:29:17.034 --> 03:29:20.097]  The World Trade Center Steel.
[03:29:20.097 --> 03:29:25.021]  So we tested this primer paint and it's not the same as these red chips.
[03:29:25.021 --> 03:29:26.142]  Not at all.
[03:29:26.142 --> 03:29:31.626]  All of the primer paint samples show potassium, magnesium, and zinc.
[03:29:31.626 --> 03:29:38.572]  None of the chips when you, I'm talking about when you get a fresh surface for both, right?
[03:29:38.572 --> 03:29:39.213]  Paint and chips.
[03:29:39.213 --> 03:29:39.733]  Look at the fresh
[03:29:40.615 --> 03:29:41.556]  Professor, stay there.
[03:29:41.556 --> 03:29:42.357]  We gotta break.
[03:29:42.357 --> 03:29:44.239]  Come back, continue with that.
[03:29:44.239 --> 03:29:48.484]  On the other side, as we debunk the hit piece put out by National Geographic.
[03:29:48.484 --> 03:29:51.747]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.747 --> 03:29:53.149]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.149 --> 03:29:55.672]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.672 --> 03:29:58.375]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.220 --> 03:30:05.444]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.444 --> 03:30:07.466]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.466 --> 03:30:15.995]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.995 --> 03:30:21.540]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.540 --> 03:30:23.162]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.382 --> 03:30:29.906]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.906 --> 03:30:40.954]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.954 --> 03:30:41.734]  That's right.
[03:30:41.734 --> 03:30:44.296]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[03:30:53.322 --> 03:30:53.803]  We're good.
[03:31:03.832 --> 03:31:06.894]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[03:31:06.894 --> 03:31:09.555]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[03:31:09.555 --> 03:31:13.297]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.

[03:32:04.657 --> 03:32:05.318]  It's here.
[03:32:05.318 --> 03:32:10.464]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[03:32:10.464 --> 03:32:18.113]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[03:32:18.809 --> 03:32:26.254]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[03:32:26.254 --> 03:32:38.003]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[03:32:38.003 --> 03:32:41.965]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[03:32:41.965 --> 03:32:44.227]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[03:32:44.227 --> 03:32:48.090]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[03:33:20.356 --> 03:33:26.698]  Mexican official confirms jetliner from Cancun hijacked on runway at Mexico City Airport.
[03:33:26.698 --> 03:33:29.399]  That's all there is.
[03:33:29.399 --> 03:33:34.661]  CNN, just watching it during the break, is saying they may be getting the people off the plane.
[03:33:34.661 --> 03:33:34.681]  999!
[03:33:34.681 --> 03:33:36.682]  You knew something would happen.
[03:33:36.682 --> 03:33:37.802]  Can't wait till this day is over.
[03:33:37.802 --> 03:33:39.482]  The globalists are obsessed with numerology.
[03:33:39.482 --> 03:33:41.663]  Flip 999 over.
[03:33:41.663 --> 03:33:42.243]  What do you get?
[03:33:42.243 --> 03:33:45.344]  And of course we're coming up on 9-11.
[03:33:45.344 --> 03:33:46.765]  I don't believe in that stuff, but they sure do.
[03:33:48.200 --> 03:33:51.661]  We're going to recap all the huge new developments with the Charlie Sheen exclusive interviews here.
[03:33:51.661 --> 03:33:52.641]  He was live today.
[03:33:52.641 --> 03:33:54.801]  That's coming up in the first hour of the show.
[03:33:54.801 --> 03:33:57.802]  I didn't announce it right at first, but he popped in at the bottom of the hour.
[03:33:57.802 --> 03:34:02.963]  And we aired a, in its entirety, a never-before-heard interview I did with him a few weeks ago at his home.
[03:34:02.963 --> 03:34:07.523]  A 21-minute interview aired in the second hour.
[03:34:07.523 --> 03:34:16.705]  And so that is all coming up again at the retransmission points at InfoWars.com and on your local AM and FM stations, Global FortWave, WWCR, and the satellite.
[03:34:18.274 --> 03:34:24.558]  Going back to Professor Steven Jones and the ten minutes we have left with him, then I'm going to cover financial news and some other issues.
[03:34:24.558 --> 03:34:29.021]  Professor Jones, you were making a point about... Right.
[03:34:29.021 --> 03:34:32.483]  So you got the paint that was on the steel, not the same thing?
[03:34:32.483 --> 03:34:32.823]  Right.
[03:34:32.823 --> 03:34:34.484]  It's not at all the same.
[03:34:34.484 --> 03:34:39.268]  It's very distinct from the red grade chip material.
[03:34:39.268 --> 03:34:47.673]  Yeah, the paint, just to recap that, as we looked at it using the electron microscopy system,
[03:34:48.488 --> 03:34:53.893]  And x-ray dispersive spectroscopy, that's that term.
[03:34:53.893 --> 03:34:57.335]  And I tell people that will be on the quiz, you know.
[03:34:57.335 --> 03:35:02.399]  And, you know, I appreciate when people make an effort to understand some of the things that we're trying to do.
[03:35:02.399 --> 03:35:05.442]  We're probing with electron beams.
[03:35:05.442 --> 03:35:08.805]  We're looking at the material that's in the dust.
[03:35:08.805 --> 03:35:12.808]  We're finding this pyrotechnic or explosive material.
[03:35:12.808 --> 03:35:15.830]  You know, I think people understand that that is significant.
[03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:17.772]  It shouldn't be there in quantities like that.
[03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:29.255]  I mean, this is an office building, for heaven's sakes, and the one sample was collected within 20 minutes of the fall of the second tower, the North Tower.
[03:35:29.255 --> 03:35:33.116]  So this cannot be contaminated by cleanup operations.
[03:35:33.116 --> 03:35:38.738]  There were no cleanup operations 20 minutes after the second tower collapsed.
[03:35:38.738 --> 03:35:43.621]  This was a fellow, Frank D'Alessio, scooped that up, got that dust.
[03:35:43.621 --> 03:35:47.042]  We found an abundance of these red gray chips in that sample.
[03:35:47.555 --> 03:35:52.678]  And his friend, what's his name, Bryden Bach, also testified.
[03:35:52.678 --> 03:35:54.360]  We have their testimony on tape.
[03:35:54.360 --> 03:36:03.225]  The chain of custody is clear, straight to me, and Jeff Ferrer, Dr. Ferrer, at BYU.
[03:36:03.225 --> 03:36:16.274]  So, again, when we compare the primer paint, this is from steel, in a monument at Clarkson College in New York State, compare that primer paint with these red, gray chips, they are not the same at all.
[03:36:17.062 --> 03:36:20.283]  The primer paint always shows zinc in abundance.
[03:36:20.283 --> 03:36:22.044]  There's a reason for that.
[03:36:22.044 --> 03:36:25.245]  And always shows potassium, always shows magnesium.
[03:36:25.245 --> 03:36:27.286]  This is a fresh surface now.
[03:36:27.286 --> 03:36:32.648]  You break off a chunk and you look at the edge so that you're not talking about dust now.
[03:36:32.648 --> 03:36:39.290]  You're talking about what's in the actual material.
[03:36:39.290 --> 03:36:46.393]  So the paint shows those elements, zinc, potassium, magnesium, always, whereas the red
[03:36:47.014 --> 03:36:47.354]  I don't know.
[03:37:09.642 --> 03:37:19.985]  Nanothermite paper in the open chemical physics... And you wouldn't put a accelerant, you wouldn't put something explosive as fireproofing on buildings?
[03:37:19.985 --> 03:37:21.426]  Absolutely.
[03:37:21.426 --> 03:37:22.566]  No, absolutely not.
[03:37:22.566 --> 03:37:24.847]  It's a very dangerous material.
[03:37:24.847 --> 03:37:28.668]  You wouldn't want to breathe it in either, Alex, I might say.
[03:37:28.668 --> 03:37:32.829]  It's another, like asbestos, it's one of those bad actors that was in the dust.
[03:37:32.829 --> 03:37:34.590]  The EPA told us it was safe.
[03:37:34.590 --> 03:37:38.151]  Of course, you know, it was an example of the government lying to us.
[03:37:38.945 --> 03:37:49.687]  And in that case, the whistleblower Nikki Tinsley was the EPA General Inspector and she blew the whistle on the EPA for lying to the people about the safety of the dust.
[03:37:49.687 --> 03:37:53.028]  And by the way, seven years ago, they would call it a conspiracy theory.
[03:37:53.028 --> 03:37:55.869]  You said Tina Todd Whitten was covering up for Bush.
[03:37:55.869 --> 03:37:59.950]  Later it came out that one of her reports said the dust is dangerous in the first week.
[03:37:59.950 --> 03:38:01.990]  The White House said, shut that down!
[03:38:01.990 --> 03:38:03.450]  That's right.
[03:38:03.450 --> 03:38:05.651]  And the EPA Inspector General Tinsley
[03:38:06.221 --> 03:38:10.783]  She spelled that out and wrote that up in a report and it got into the press.
[03:38:10.783 --> 03:38:15.264]  I think it was in 2003 that that truth came out about what the EPA had done.
[03:38:15.264 --> 03:38:24.567]  So, you know, it's a clear example of where the government, uh, high-level, White House, you'd say, has lied to us.
[03:38:24.567 --> 03:38:27.869]  And, uh, so now here we have, we're having to ferret this out.
[03:38:27.869 --> 03:38:33.991]  NIST refuses to look for explosive, or explosive residues in the World Trade Center dust.
[03:38:33.991 --> 03:38:34.791]  Well, we've done so.
[03:38:35.586 --> 03:38:38.948]  And we challenge them to do so, you know.
[03:38:38.948 --> 03:38:41.889]  But they have just adamantly refused.
[03:38:41.889 --> 03:38:46.731]  And their excuse is, well, if you look for something that isn't there, you won't find it.
[03:38:46.731 --> 03:38:47.852]  And I'm saying, excuse me?
[03:38:47.852 --> 03:38:50.953]  How do you know it's not there until you look?
[03:38:50.953 --> 03:38:51.934]  You know?
[03:38:51.934 --> 03:38:54.035]  But it's just really remarkable.
[03:38:54.035 --> 03:39:03.780]  And if I may throw in another one, which of course was missed by the Nat Geo program, that is the free-fall acceleration of World Trade Center 7.
[03:39:04.895 --> 03:39:07.776]  For over two seconds, and that's over a hundred feet.
[03:39:07.776 --> 03:39:11.558]  The roof was measured by David Chandler.
[03:39:11.558 --> 03:39:20.302]  I looked at this too, but to David's credit, he plotted the data, you know, and showed this is essentially free fall.
[03:39:20.302 --> 03:39:22.544]  And then he and I both challenged NIST.
[03:39:22.544 --> 03:39:29.347]  Remember last August they had this forum where you could send in questions by email, which I did and he did.
[03:39:29.347 --> 03:39:33.589]  We both challenged them on their statements about the rate of fall of the
[03:39:34.218 --> 03:39:36.439]  World Trade Center 7.
[03:39:36.439 --> 03:39:51.002]  And sure enough, NIST, now this is a little bit to their credit, they came back and plotted the data, it agrees, it lines up with free fall acceleration, it lines up with what David Chandler and I were trying to say.
[03:39:51.002 --> 03:39:59.124]  And so they admitted that, but to their great discredit, they did not go back and say, well, this is really strange, that means there's nothing impeding the fall.
[03:39:59.124 --> 03:40:01.065]  That's what free fall means, there's nothing in the way.
[03:40:02.045 --> 03:40:04.867]  You know, you've got hundreds of thousands of tons of steel and concrete.
[03:40:04.867 --> 03:40:08.090]  These beams don't just give up and disappear.
[03:40:08.090 --> 03:40:11.793]  Their mass alone would slow the roof down, but nothing slowed it down.
[03:40:11.793 --> 03:40:15.476]  Now, that takes explosives to move this material out of the way.
[03:40:15.476 --> 03:40:21.841]  It's a prime evidence for explosives, along with the red chips that we have found.
[03:40:21.841 --> 03:40:29.127]  But what NIST did, they swept that data, they showed that plot, but then they say, oh, this is consistent with our computer model.
[03:40:29.127 --> 03:40:30.168]  That's the end of that.
[03:40:30.168 --> 03:40:31.669]  We're not going to discuss it anymore.
[03:40:32.856 --> 03:40:46.503]  And so you know that a computer model, which they will not let us test, I mean, it just can't be, Alex, that having hundreds of thousands of tons of material on the way and you get free fall.
[03:40:46.503 --> 03:40:57.068]  Unless they took that out of the computer model, which actually you can do in a computer simulation, but you can't do that in real life unless you use explosives to move the material out of the way.
[03:40:58.001 --> 03:41:05.407]  But underwriting laboratories, in their own report, said that they did fire testing for similar things and it didn't make anything collapse.
[03:41:05.407 --> 03:41:07.249]  And it didn't fail, did not fail, right?
[03:41:07.249 --> 03:41:09.651]  Kevin Ryan pointed that one out.
[03:41:09.651 --> 03:41:14.115]  And he lost his job over making that one public, as I recall that was the issue.
[03:41:15.117 --> 03:41:15.778]  That's right.
[03:41:15.778 --> 03:41:22.642]  You were persecuted, no doubt, and driven out of your professorship, even though you were one of the top lights at that university.
[03:41:22.642 --> 03:41:25.384]  Huge developments and discoveries in your own right.
[03:41:25.384 --> 03:41:29.567]  But the truth is the truth, and God loves you for what you've done, and the American people do.
[03:41:29.567 --> 03:41:35.851]  I hear there's a film coming out soon with a lot of the material that you've presented in it.
[03:41:35.851 --> 03:41:38.813]  With material that I presented included in the bill?
[03:41:39.482 --> 03:41:40.442]  No, no, in a film.
[03:41:40.442 --> 03:41:40.923]  I'm sorry.
[03:41:40.923 --> 03:41:41.883]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:41:41.883 --> 03:41:42.824]  A film, yes.
[03:41:42.824 --> 03:41:44.224]  Yeah.
[03:41:44.224 --> 03:41:46.525]  Dylan Avery and his guys are doing one.
[03:41:46.525 --> 03:41:48.206]  Is that the one you're talking about?
[03:41:48.206 --> 03:41:51.528]  Well, there's that one, but I've seen other stuff on the web.
[03:41:51.528 --> 03:41:54.829]  I guess a lot of people are just taking your material then and making films.
[03:41:54.829 --> 03:41:57.670]  That is very, very exciting, Professor.
[03:41:57.670 --> 03:42:02.072]  Yeah, and you know, it's not, again, I have to emphasize, it's not just me, Alex.
[03:42:02.072 --> 03:42:07.615]  I worked with Neil Tarrant and Dr. Ferrer, Kevin Ryan, Frank Leakey.
[03:42:08.480 --> 03:42:11.563]  Brad Larson, you know, Danny Farnsworth.
[03:42:29.040 --> 03:42:50.153]  Uh, but I mean, I wish three years ago, I had medical doctors on and they said, look, in the trials of Gardasil, human papillomavirus vaccine, it's killing girls and maiming and paralyzing them, and I went on air and talked about it and got made fun of by the media, and then now it's all over the news, everywhere I turn, uh, where the human papillomavirus shot is killing or maiming or paralyzing people.
[03:42:50.153 --> 03:42:52.875]  I mean, we're just, we're just trying to tell the truth here.
[03:42:52.875 --> 03:42:54.796]  It's not enjoyable, I'll tell you.
[03:42:54.796 --> 03:42:58.358]  I, I totally agree with you, and it does, uh, there's a personal cost.
[03:42:58.982 --> 03:43:00.963]  As you and I both know.
[03:43:00.963 --> 03:43:05.704]  I wanted to ask you, Alex, if I can turn the tables just for a minute.
[03:43:05.704 --> 03:43:12.125]  I'm really curious what you're finding out about this vaccine for the swine flu.
[03:43:12.125 --> 03:43:16.566]  And I'm sorry if I changed the topic, but I just gotta ask you that question.
[03:43:16.566 --> 03:43:23.108]  Do you have any, I'm sure you have some strong feelings, but any advice on what we can do about what's coming down the pike?
[03:43:23.578 --> 03:43:34.707]  You know, there's so many pieces of political data, socioeconomic data, so many medical doctors and scientists and virologists I've interviewed and all the different perspectives.
[03:43:34.707 --> 03:43:41.312]  It's almost like I've over-analyzed it to the point of, we know it's a lie, we know it's a fraud.
[03:43:41.312 --> 03:43:47.717]  We knew in January they were gearing up for quarantines, mass graves, federalization, Northcom to put 400,000 troops on the streets.
[03:43:49.739 --> 03:43:51.621]  And we saw all these movements in January.
[03:43:51.621 --> 03:43:59.247]  I went on air and said, I believe it's flu-related, because emergency managers in Chicago and in Indiana were telling me this, and in upstate New York.
[03:43:59.247 --> 03:44:02.370]  Then I got secret documents and published them.
[03:44:02.370 --> 03:44:04.231]  And we said, this isn't a drill.
[03:44:04.231 --> 03:44:08.215]  They're not using this just as a cover for federalization.
[03:44:09.679 --> 03:44:12.221]  The banks are financing this worldwide.
[03:44:12.221 --> 03:44:20.567]  It's kind of a way, if they want to worldwide shut everything down during the economic implosion of their engineering in the fall, that they're going to use this to clamp down.
[03:44:20.567 --> 03:44:22.688]  I said that in January.
[03:44:22.688 --> 03:44:25.370]  Then in April, the flu popped up.
[03:44:25.370 --> 03:44:29.112]  We said regular flu kills over 36,000 people every year.
[03:44:29.112 --> 03:44:31.194]  Why are they fear-mongering over a few deaths?
[03:44:31.194 --> 03:44:31.754]  Now it's over 500.
[03:44:33.499 --> 03:44:37.305]  Why did it come out in the wrong year, wrong time of year, wrong hemisphere?
[03:44:37.305 --> 03:44:37.706]  Why?
[03:44:37.706 --> 03:44:39.108]  I had virologist on.
[03:44:39.108 --> 03:44:41.992]  It was in BBC News saying it's a manufactured flu.
[03:44:41.992 --> 03:44:44.256]  We can look at its pedigree and tell it just came out of nowhere.
[03:44:44.256 --> 03:44:46.339]  It's been engineered part human, part bird, part pig.
[03:44:49.730 --> 03:44:57.073]  So the question is, is it just engineered hype to get federalization in place as a cover without a bunch of death and forced inoculations?
[03:44:57.073 --> 03:44:59.113]  Or is it a cover just to sell a bunch of vaccines?
[03:44:59.113 --> 03:45:00.154]  Or are they really planning?
[03:45:00.154 --> 03:45:02.675]  Do they know it's going to mutate into something more deadly?
[03:45:02.675 --> 03:45:09.737]  Vaccine trials in Europe have killed a bunch of people with different flu vaccines in the last year, namely bird flu.
[03:45:09.737 --> 03:45:11.858]  There's internal CDC reports that have come out.
[03:45:12.910 --> 03:45:24.653]  Admitting that this could cause that Gillian Bernays disorder and nerve degeneration and even death that happened in 76 with the same type of swine flu that popped up in a military base after inoculations.
[03:45:25.779 --> 03:45:27.320]  But people don't seem to be buying this.
[03:45:27.320 --> 03:45:31.001]  Remember back in 2002, they tried the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[03:45:31.001 --> 03:45:42.525]  Tried to order all first responders, nurses, doctors, police, firemen, 14 million total, the LA Times reported, to take these inoculations for smallpox.
[03:45:42.525 --> 03:45:45.726]  But then Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take it, so the whole thing fell apart.
[03:45:45.726 --> 03:45:52.109]  So they keep trying this, but usually when it's just a hype thing they're doing, they don't build up all these assets.
[03:45:53.041 --> 03:45:57.806]  And so, I think it's an ace in the hole for them to release something else if they want.
[03:45:57.806 --> 03:46:08.796]  I mean, we know it's staged, but at a certain point then, we know what they're saying is a lie, we know it's staged, but we don't know what their exact playbook is.
[03:46:08.796 --> 03:46:10.798]  Or exactly when.
[03:46:10.798 --> 03:46:16.784]  If I can interject too, one thing I really appreciate about you, Alex, is your personal research.
[03:46:16.784 --> 03:46:18.145]  I'm sure you have a team, but
[03:46:18.777 --> 03:46:26.280]  You have these facts right at your fingertips, and I think it's great on a variety of subjects that correlate.
[03:46:26.280 --> 03:46:29.522]  And the second point, I really appreciate that about you and your program.
[03:46:29.522 --> 03:46:39.726]  The second thing I wanted to say was that I get asked, I was just asked the other day, oh, you know, maybe 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:46:39.726 --> 03:46:45.149]  I mean, maybe the government knew about it or let it happen, you know, but what difference does it make, really?
[03:46:45.149 --> 03:46:46.169]  I mean, it's over with.
[03:46:46.169 --> 03:46:46.750]  It's past.
[03:46:46.750 --> 03:46:47.650]  It was eight years ago.
[03:46:48.288 --> 03:46:59.497]  And I say, look, these same people, the puppeteers there, if you get the big picture, it's not over.
[03:46:59.497 --> 03:47:13.707]  And the sooner we wake up, the sooner we can do something to change our republic, to have this renaissance that we need to clean up these guys, if we possibly can at this late date.
[03:47:17.678 --> 03:47:26.566]  I mean, every time I think about getting set up, getting put in prison, getting killed, and I'm not trying to get sympathy here, folks.
[03:47:26.566 --> 03:47:33.632]  I mean, it's... I don't even tell you a tenth of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes, but I live in like a James Bond movie, but I'm not James Bond.
[03:47:33.632 --> 03:47:34.413]  I'm just an average guy.
[03:47:36.994 --> 03:47:45.222]  The, whenever it's overwhelming or I wake up at 3am, like, not even fear, but more just gripped by the enormity, I think about my children, but other people's children.
[03:47:45.222 --> 03:47:49.446]  And you're right, these sickos that did this are going to continue to stage events.
[03:47:49.446 --> 03:47:50.927]  They're going to continue to do wicked things.
[03:47:50.927 --> 03:47:52.469]  It wasn't George Bush that did this.
[03:47:52.469 --> 03:47:54.831]  It was, it was the National Security Council.
[03:47:54.831 --> 03:47:56.713]  It was the private corporate takeover above them.
[03:47:57.273 --> 03:48:02.196]  You know, the CFR wrote manuals how they needed big catalyzing terror events and Cheney did.
[03:48:02.196 --> 03:48:03.156]  Right.
[03:48:03.156 --> 03:48:04.177]  And I'm in this.
[03:48:04.177 --> 03:48:08.899]  When I got involved thirteen and a half, fourteen years ago, I had no idea how deep it was, how bad it was.
[03:48:08.899 --> 03:48:09.919]  I was naive.
[03:48:09.919 --> 03:48:12.561]  I was just standing up for the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[03:48:12.561 --> 03:48:15.122]  And now I realize I'm point of no return.
[03:48:15.122 --> 03:48:16.203]  I can't go back.
[03:48:16.203 --> 03:48:17.763]  Plus, none of us can go back.
[03:48:17.763 --> 03:48:22.026]  Even if people live in denial and say this isn't happening, you can't go back.
[03:48:22.026 --> 03:48:23.867]  You can't go back once you know the truth.
[03:48:25.003 --> 03:48:26.164]  That's right.
[03:48:26.164 --> 03:48:27.785]  Yeah, I felt the same way.
[03:48:27.785 --> 03:48:43.915]  When I learned about this, it was actually spring of 2005 when I first saw World Trade Center 7 coming down, and the way it came down, I pulled out my stopwatch, you know, and I was reading and analyzing, and it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[03:48:43.915 --> 03:48:48.698]  And then, you know, I'm reading this, what was the name, PNAC report that came out in
[03:48:50.683 --> 03:48:53.105]  Well, it came out just about a year ago.
[03:48:53.105 --> 03:48:56.147]  September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[03:48:56.147 --> 03:48:56.787]  Right.
[03:48:56.787 --> 03:49:03.912]  So just one year before 9-11, 2001, and I think, man, these guys are talking about American Empire.
[03:49:03.912 --> 03:49:05.814]  And they're not even, you know, hiding it.
[03:49:05.814 --> 03:49:11.878]  They want hegemony, domination, using United States military power.
[03:49:11.878 --> 03:49:16.601]  And they say we've got to have a Pearl Harbor-style event to do it.
[03:49:16.601 --> 03:49:18.042]  Pearl Harbor killed 3,000, 9-11 killed right at 3,000.
[03:49:21.070 --> 03:49:30.295]  Yeah, and so anyway, it hit me and, you know, a lot of my family now have awakened to this situation.
[03:49:30.295 --> 03:49:31.716]  Awful situation, really.
[03:49:31.716 --> 03:49:35.097]  But, you know, there's some things we feel that we are doing.
[03:49:35.097 --> 03:49:37.779]  It's not totally pessimistic, is it?
[03:49:37.779 --> 03:49:46.203]  People like you and I are speaking out, doing what we can, and then, you know, I always like to encourage people to get food storage and
[03:49:46.940 --> 03:49:50.541]  I'm sure glad I bought some gold and silver a few years ago.
[03:49:50.541 --> 03:49:51.981]  Gold just went over $1,000 an ounce.
[03:49:51.981 --> 03:49:54.442]  Do you see that?
[03:49:54.442 --> 03:49:54.962]  Yeah, I did.
[03:49:54.962 --> 03:49:57.083]  We told people to buy it when it was $300.
[03:49:57.083 --> 03:49:57.983]  But we're not perfect.
[03:49:57.983 --> 03:49:58.363]  We try.
[03:49:58.363 --> 03:49:59.403]  I mean, I buy gold.
[03:49:59.403 --> 03:50:00.143]  I've got guns.
[03:50:00.143 --> 03:50:01.104]  I've got food.
[03:50:01.104 --> 03:50:02.244]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[03:50:02.244 --> 03:50:11.746]  I just know that when you leave us in the final segment, I'm going to hit the news where top economists are in major news saying the dollar will probably die in the next two years.
[03:50:11.746 --> 03:50:13.567]  We will probably be like Argentina.
[03:50:13.567 --> 03:50:14.847]  I'm not the one saying that.
[03:50:15.487 --> 03:50:17.868]  But we knew years ago they were planning it.
[03:50:17.868 --> 03:50:24.172]  Professor, I'd like to have you back sometime just on your political beliefs and ideas, because I find this very refreshing discussing it with you.
[03:50:24.172 --> 03:50:27.153]  Fire out the websites for folks.
[03:50:27.153 --> 03:50:28.934]  Okay, websites.
[03:50:28.934 --> 03:50:35.078]  Let me start with journalof911studies.com.
[03:50:35.078 --> 03:50:41.241]  And that has over a hundred peer-reviewed papers, and then plus it links to our three major papers in it.
[03:50:41.241 --> 03:50:42.242]  We're almost out of time.
[03:50:42.242 --> 03:50:43.802]  Fire out the other.
[03:50:43.802 --> 03:50:44.263]  Oh boy.
[03:50:47.016 --> 03:50:51.479]  Gosh, uh, STJ911, AE911truth.org.
[03:50:51.479 --> 03:50:52.199]  Professor?
[03:50:52.199 --> 03:50:54.200]  Oh, one more thing, quick, Alex.
[03:50:54.200 --> 03:50:57.923]  We're starting up a scientist for 9-11 Truth.
[03:50:57.923 --> 03:51:00.184]  That should be out here next week, I hope.
[03:51:00.184 --> 03:51:01.165]  Awesome, God bless you.
[03:51:02.642 --> 03:51:11.607]  Did you know that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles, wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[03:51:11.607 --> 03:51:14.269]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy.
[03:51:14.269 --> 03:51:16.010]  This book is for you.
[03:51:16.010 --> 03:51:21.393]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth, and it's called, Here's What You Do.
[03:51:21.393 --> 03:51:25.375]  You can buy it for only $6 at here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:51:25.375 --> 03:51:27.617]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:51:27.617 --> 03:51:30.178]  Again, here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:51:30.178 --> 03:51:30.859]  Buy it today.
[03:51:31.679 --> 03:51:32.920]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:51:32.920 --> 03:51:37.482]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:51:37.482 --> 03:51:43.285]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:51:43.285 --> 03:51:46.927]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:51:46.927 --> 03:51:49.648]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:51:49.648 --> 03:51:54.711]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:51:54.711 --> 03:51:54.991]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:51:57.552 --> 03:52:02.435]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:52:02.435 --> 03:52:08.239]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.239 --> 03:52:15.823]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.823 --> 03:52:21.987]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:22.407 --> 03:52:24.367]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:24.367 --> 03:52:26.868]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.868 --> 03:52:38.451]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.451 --> 03:52:40.131]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.131 --> 03:52:41.992]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.992 --> 03:52:48.193]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.880 --> 03:52:57.153]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.153 --> 03:52:58.735]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.735 --> 03:52:59.937]  The people strike back!
[03:53:06.636 --> 03:53:07.077]  I think so.
[03:53:23.507 --> 03:53:24.107]  I think so.
[03:53:51.673 --> 03:53:54.397]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:53:54.397 --> 03:53:55.038]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[03:54:30.563 --> 03:54:35.310]  Coming up in the next hour at InfoWars.com on the audio streams and Aminatums that re-air it.
[03:54:35.310 --> 03:54:38.715]  Charlie Sheen live on air and the taped interview with Charlie Sheen.
[03:54:38.715 --> 03:54:41.559]  We cover all that coming up if you missed any of it, all the big developments there.
[03:54:44.608 --> 03:54:48.031]  You know, I've got to do at least an hour tomorrow on the show with this.
[03:54:48.031 --> 03:55:01.443]  And for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, you can see this, but for online folks, Obama to seal US-UN relationship to become head of the UN Security Council at the same time as being president, first time ever, merging us with the UN, basically, Financial Times of London.
[03:55:01.443 --> 03:55:06.567]  McClatchy news, a year after financial crisis, a new world order emerges.
[03:55:06.567 --> 03:55:09.129]  UN panel calls for dollar reserve to be eliminated.
[03:55:09.129 --> 03:55:11.972]  That is the United Nations, and Obama's bringing us into this.
[03:55:13.486 --> 03:55:15.728]  That is Wall Street Journal.
[03:55:15.728 --> 03:55:18.490]  Barack Obama accused of making depression mistakes.
[03:55:18.490 --> 03:55:24.354]  Then it goes on to say top economist of George Washington, George Mason University.
[03:55:24.354 --> 03:55:25.916]  It is also not impossible that the U.S.
[03:55:25.916 --> 03:55:34.042]  will experience the kind of economic collapse from first to third world status experienced by Argentina under the National Socialist government of Juan Perón.
[03:55:36.050 --> 03:55:36.310]  U.N.
[03:55:36.310 --> 03:55:38.331]  wants new global currency to replace dollar.
[03:55:38.331 --> 03:55:40.993]  That's a London Guardian, another article in the London Telegraph.
[03:55:40.993 --> 03:55:44.635]  Nancy Pelosi, every aspect of her life must be subject to inventory.
[03:55:44.635 --> 03:55:46.856]  France mulls CO2 taxes on all citizens.
[03:55:46.856 --> 03:55:48.757]  Everything you eat, everything you do, tract.
[03:55:48.757 --> 03:55:50.158]  You get a carbon ration.
[03:55:50.158 --> 03:55:52.519]  We had the British scientist calling for that a few months ago.
[03:55:52.519 --> 03:55:56.742]  German government advisor, top environment guys propose a CO2 budget for everyone on planet.
[03:55:57.950 --> 03:56:01.332]  If you complain about your daughter getting killed or paralyzed, Times of London from Gardasil.
[03:56:01.332 --> 03:56:03.833]  They take your other children, Times of London.
[03:56:03.833 --> 03:56:05.474]  They're going to take your kids away to fat camps.
[03:56:05.474 --> 03:56:10.517]  They're saying in England they want tens of thousands of kids to be taken at birth and raised in government dormitories first.
[03:56:10.517 --> 03:56:12.619]  All the parents prove they can be parents.
[03:56:12.619 --> 03:56:15.440]  This is what's going on financially and politically.
[03:56:15.440 --> 03:56:17.702]  I mean, this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:56:18.442 --> 03:56:22.431]  And if we let the bankers know we're not going to go along with it, they won't bankrupt everything.
[03:56:22.431 --> 03:56:25.397]  Just like if we let them know they're behind the flu stuff, they'll back off.
[03:56:25.397 --> 03:56:29.285]  I wanted to bring Ted up in the last three minutes before we go into retransmission at InfoWars.com.
[03:56:31.553 --> 03:56:39.159]  Ted, and there's so many big developments coming up this week I haven't even told you about, other special celebrity guests, looks like Thursday or Friday, tomorrow or Friday.
[03:56:39.159 --> 03:56:51.788]  Ted, briefly, you've still got gold you bought at the $9.45 level, silver you bought when it was $2, less than it is now, you're almost running out, you told me during a break earlier, you want to give people this offer, this may be the last time, you were selling for $905 an ounce a week ago,
[03:56:54.252 --> 03:56:57.153]  It's up at $1,000 right now, been above $1,000.
[03:56:57.153 --> 03:56:58.393]  People can get this right now.
[03:56:58.393 --> 03:57:00.394]  Tell folks the offer you've got, Ted Anderson.
[03:57:00.394 --> 03:57:06.856]  Well, here's the best offer that I have right now, bar none of the Walking Liberty halves, and they're at $8.69.
[03:57:06.856 --> 03:57:10.278]  That's relative to the spot silver at $11 an ounce.
[03:57:10.278 --> 03:57:11.038]  Right now it's about $16.50.
[03:57:11.038 --> 03:57:14.439]  So that's below spot.
[03:57:14.439 --> 03:57:15.919]  Excuse me, that's below spot.
[03:57:15.919 --> 03:57:19.621]  Yep, it was below where the spot is today when I originally accumulated this deal.
[03:57:19.621 --> 03:57:21.201]  You can't get a better deal on silver.
[03:57:21.201 --> 03:57:22.342]  Okay, below spot silver.
[03:57:22.342 --> 03:57:23.022]  Tell us about the gold.
[03:57:23.402 --> 03:57:28.989]  Yeah, the gold right now, the best thing in gold right now, are they going to be the $10 Liberty at $8.18.50?
[03:57:28.989 --> 03:57:33.534]  Or pick up the British Sovereign of the Frank at $2.33 and $2.88?
[03:57:33.534 --> 03:57:35.536]  Alex, the markets are going like this.
[03:57:35.536 --> 03:57:39.521]  The United States market's trying to press gold down, and once the Asian markets open up,
[03:57:39.881 --> 03:57:41.863]  Gold goes back up over $1,000 an ounce.
[03:57:41.863 --> 03:57:45.245]  It's been as high as $1,005 today.
[03:57:45.245 --> 03:57:46.106]  And you can just see it.
[03:57:46.106 --> 03:57:48.227]  The Asian people want to get out of the U.S.
[03:57:48.227 --> 03:57:49.008]  dollar.
[03:57:49.008 --> 03:57:55.813]  And the Federal Reserve System here in New York, which is where the comics is, is trying to push it down when the New York market opens up.
[03:57:55.813 --> 03:57:57.874]  So it's kangarooing, folks.
[03:57:57.874 --> 03:57:59.355]  Can't beat these gold and silver deals.
[03:57:59.355 --> 03:58:01.036]  The brokers are standing by until midnight tonight.

[03:58:01.617 --> 03:58:03.238]  Ted, how long can you hold this deal?
[03:58:09.002 --> 03:58:12.765]  We're gonna definitely hold it till midnight, and we'll see what goes on in the market tomorrow.
[03:58:12.765 --> 03:58:15.327]  Very volatile, I don't know for sure.
[03:58:15.327 --> 03:58:17.168]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:17.168 --> 03:58:20.211]  Get out of some of those paper notes into gold and silver today.
[03:58:20.211 --> 03:58:20.431]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:20.431 --> 03:58:25.214]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much.
[03:58:25.214 --> 03:58:26.335]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:58:26.335 --> 03:58:27.496]  Brokers are there to take your call.
[03:58:27.496 --> 03:58:27.696]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:27.696 --> 03:58:30.919]  Unbelievably good job.
[03:58:30.919 --> 03:58:33.060]  The show today was off the charts.
[03:58:33.060 --> 03:58:36.583]  Retransmission with Charlie Sheen in the first hour live starts right now.
[03:58:36.583 --> 03:58:37.524]  He was on live today with us.
[03:58:41.883 --> 03:58:46.615]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:51.667 --> 03:58:56.870]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:56.870 --> 03:59:00.913]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.913 --> 03:59:06.818]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.818 --> 03:59:11.881]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.881 --> 03:59:12.382]  Number three,
[03:59:12.782 --> 03:59:19.090]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:19.090 --> 03:59:21.974]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:59:21.974 --> 03:59:26.520]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:26.520 --> 03:59:30.125]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:59:30.345 --> 03:59:36.088]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
