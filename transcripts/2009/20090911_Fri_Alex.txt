[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.203]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:12.845]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:18.909]  Charlie, it's great to be here with you.
[00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:20.910]  I appreciate you doing this interview.
[00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.670]  Likewise, Alex.
[00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.030]  Thank you.
[00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:27.013]  Why, after three years of silence concerning 9-11, are you now speaking up?
[00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:31.776]  And why have you written this public letter that you've now published?
[00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:37.685]  Well, Alex, I wrote this letter for two reasons.
[00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:44.230]  Firstly, I wanted to create a public document specifically rooted in fact.
[00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:52.436]  If anybody dares question that, I would encourage those people to scrutinize it, to research it.
[00:00:54.173 --> 00:00:57.114]  The truth is unchanging, Alex, as we both know.
[00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:02.737]  The only aspect of this piece that had to be manufactured were the President's words.
[00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:09.039]  Everything else will withstand the critical assault I'm more than prepared to endure.
[00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:17.783]  And secondly, this is our first new President since 9-11, and consequently his first 9-11 anniversary in office.
[00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:20.859]  Enough stonewalling.
[00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.201]  Enough media manipulation.
[00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:25.884]  Enough media mantra speak.
[00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:28.426]  The families deserve better, Alex.
[00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:30.368]  America deserves better.
[00:01:30.388 --> 00:01:31.169]  I mean, come on.
[00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:32.550]  Come on, people.
[00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.535]  The 9-11 Commission report is a blatant work of manipulation, secrecy, and fiction.
[00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:40.243]  Come on, the time is now.
[00:01:40.343 --> 00:01:41.883]  Demand the truth.
[00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:51.126]  I personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right into our Congress.
[00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:52.746]  We have to take action.
[00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:54.027]  We have to stand as one.
[00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:57.188]  We must insist that our new president deliver on his promises.
[00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:01.065]  All right, that's Charlie Sheen from my taped interview with him.
[00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:04.007]  In 20 minutes, he's going to be live with us here on air.
[00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:08.750]  We're going to have Bob up for a full hour next week, because I really want to get into the economy with him.
[00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.931]  We've got this Limbaugh clip of him talking about it today.
[00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:15.713]  It's kind of hammered audio, but we're going to play it in about 10 minutes when Bob leaves us.
[00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:22.557]  But again, 33 after, bottom of this hour, we're going to go to Charlie Sheen live here on air.
[00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:29.750]  Bob, I want to get your comments on what Charlie and I are doing and the American people and people of the world are doing right now.
[00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:32.613]  Kind of our side up against the globalists.
[00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:39.819]  But before we do that, finishing up, clearly then, do you believe they're deciding to abandon the dollar?
[00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.100]  The Chinese are saying they may abandon the dollar.
[00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:44.062]  What is happening right now?
[00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:45.823]  Why is gold shot up to above $1,013 today?
[00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:46.344]  Flight to quality.
[00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.472]  Yes, they are afraid of the abandoning of the dollar because people don't see much, if any, inflation at all.
[00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:57.672]  So that can be the only reason why it's up.
[00:02:57.732 --> 00:03:05.154]  And I think, as I said before, down the line, and I don't know how far, six months, two and a half years, I don't know.
[00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:10.716]  I do know that they are going to devalue the dollar officially and they're going to default
[00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:33.077]  Simultaneously, at some meeting like the Smithsonian they had in the early 70s, or the Plaza Record they had in 85 in Paris, and there's going to be revaluation and devaluations, currency against currency, and I think there's going to be a debt default of perhaps two-thirds of debt of all of those who are in debt to clean the whole mess up.
[00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:39.541]  And at the same time, I think what they want to do, what they should do for international trade, is
[00:03:40.131 --> 00:03:52.336]  A 20 nation international unit made up of all those currencies plus a 10% balance of gold within that unit.
[00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:55.097]  And then it'll be perfectly acceptable for trade.
[00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:56.398]  Now Bob, let's explain.
[00:03:56.738 --> 00:04:00.960]  People are going to spend this saying Bob Chapman's with a straw man argument.
[00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:03.652]  Bob Chapman's calling for global currency.
[00:04:03.732 --> 00:04:03.932]  No.
[00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:05.513]  They're killing the dollar.
[00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:06.893]  They've hoarded out.
[00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:08.374]  They've maxed it out.
[00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:13.837]  They've run up our credit cards, our national credit card to 1.5 quadrillion, according to many economists.
[00:04:14.577 --> 00:04:17.878]  And so now they want to have a new global tyrannical currency.
[00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.300]  You're saying for global trade there will be a world reserve currency.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.401]  Let's make sure it's a free and fair one.
[00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:29.584]  So you're talking real world ball game here, not fantasy land.
[00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:33.097]  And then second of all, they'll come along later.
[00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:34.437]  How much later?
[00:04:34.498 --> 00:04:35.078]  I don't know.
[00:04:35.398 --> 00:04:37.279]  And they'll say, well, gee, that worked really well.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.381]  Now let's have a world currency.
[00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:42.182]  That's how I think they're going to slide into it.
[00:04:42.843 --> 00:04:45.304]  And I've been saying this for months, as you well know.
[00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:49.487]  And three months ago, you said that they would announce that Madoff had cancer.
[00:04:50.068 --> 00:04:51.629]  Now they've floated that out there.
[00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:55.611]  How did you know that was going to happen?
[00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:59.974]  I had some information from other people, but I backed into it as well.
[00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:12.639]  The next thing is he'll have a heart attack, supposedly be taken out and buried and probably end up at the hands of the plastic surgeon so he can go and live in Israel or Paraguay or wherever they're going to put him.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.021]  Well, Ken Lay, we know that was staged.
[00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:18.521]  That's even come out in foreign news.
[00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:20.141]  That's right.
[00:05:20.782 --> 00:05:25.663]  And then we have the young man, Timothy McVeigh, who supposedly was
[00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:29.966]  I have my doubts about that as well.
[00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:32.908]  Well, local reporters said he was breathing when they took him out.
[00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:34.850]  Well, there you go.
[00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.574]  I think they take these people to other destinations and they live happily ever after.
[00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:53.607]  Now, when you were working in black ops against the Soviets, I mean, I've read even 50 years ago, they took large portions of special forces and would even stage their deaths or change their names, give them plastic surgery, change their ears, their nose.
[00:05:53.947 --> 00:05:55.068]  That's declassified.
[00:05:55.108 --> 00:05:58.129]  So why wouldn't they do that with Madoff or Ken Lay?
[00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.090]  I mean, that's what they do in the Witness Protection Program.
[00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.171]  They stage the deaths a lot.
[00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:03.592]  That's right.
[00:06:03.692 --> 00:06:05.793]  And so I think that's the way this has gone.
[00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:06.893]  They take care of their own.
[00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.374]  That's the way they do it.
[00:06:08.414 --> 00:06:10.895]  If you step out of line, you know, you get assassinated.
[00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:25.757]  But, you know, this program you've got coming up on Charlie Sheen, I knew Charlie when he lived in Malibu, and I'm very happy to see he has attained the intellectual abilities that he has.
[00:06:25.777 --> 00:06:34.341]  My kids grew up at the same time he did, and I knew his father quite well, Martin, because I used to go to church with him all the time.
[00:06:35.221 --> 00:06:40.864]  And so I'm very happy to see Charlie come out, and he was always a gutsy kid.
[00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:44.999]  Always a little wild and a great baseball player.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.741]  Amazing.
[00:06:47.761 --> 00:06:49.902]  Well, I'll say hi to him when he's on with us.
[00:06:51.403 --> 00:06:52.504]  So much is going on.
[00:06:52.844 --> 00:06:55.186]  Obviously, you say get gold, get silver to protect yourself.
[00:06:56.547 --> 00:07:05.053]  Ted Anderson was on earlier offering gold coins he bought at $9.45 in the market, in the current market, and silver, a dollar under what it is.
[00:07:05.494 --> 00:07:07.675]  Is that not an insanely good deal, Bob?
[00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:09.276]  It certainly is.
[00:07:10.228 --> 00:07:15.599]  He continues to come up with these good investment deals, and we all should be proud of him.
[00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:22.192]  Sure, he's making money, but he's giving people great deals, and he should be thanked for that.
[00:07:23.288 --> 00:07:29.771]  Absolutely, and supporting this network, folks can call about that deal at 800-686-2237.
[00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:29.831]  800-686-2237.

[00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:56.139]  Give folks the toll-free number if people want to call and get a hard copy, a free introductory hard copy of The International Forecaster.
[00:07:56.939 --> 00:07:57.740]  That's toll-free, 877-479-8178.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:57.980]  That's 877-479-8178.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.861]  Alright, we've got about two or three minutes left here, Bob.
[00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:03.683]  In closing, what do you see happening in the fall?
[00:08:16.146 --> 00:08:20.952]  I see terrible things with the dollar going down to 71.18 on the USDX.
[00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:27.661]  I see great consternation and turmoil over the swine flu shots.
[00:08:28.723 --> 00:08:30.986]  The government, as you know, has been experimenting on our
[00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:31.737]  I think so.
[00:08:49.637 --> 00:08:51.578]  For the storm that they see coming ahead.
[00:08:52.018 --> 00:08:54.519]  His next speech is going to be about the economy.
[00:08:54.939 --> 00:08:56.560]  The economy is in dreadful shape.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.541]  And it might, you know, go sideways for the next year.
[00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:04.142]  But if they don't add another $2 trillion or the banks don't start lending, it's over.
[00:09:04.683 --> 00:09:05.763]  So that's what they're going to do.
[00:09:05.783 --> 00:09:13.986]  You're going to see, and I predicted this last January, you're going to see them come up with another stimulus plan next year to make sure all these Democrats get back in office.
[00:09:14.739 --> 00:09:19.684]  Or I shouldn't say it that way, I should say everybody who's in office gets back in.
[00:09:19.784 --> 00:09:20.805]  That's what it's all about.
[00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:23.687]  And so I think that's what's going to happen.
[00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:27.130]  Well, you're absolutely...
[00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.211]  Absolutely on target over and over again, Bob.
[00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:33.332]  We'll continue to watch this unfold.
[00:09:34.012 --> 00:09:39.554]  I think it's key that as the globalists implode the economy by design, we continue to say, audit the Fed.
[00:09:39.574 --> 00:09:41.795]  These are the people that engineered the collapse.
[00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:47.777]  These are the individuals creating a global Ponzi scheme that they want to panic us into the next phase of accepting world government.
[00:09:48.197 --> 00:09:51.719]  No, we must indict the bankers, as Ron Paul has said on this show.
[00:09:52.119 --> 00:09:53.499]  We must go after the globalists.
[00:09:53.819 --> 00:09:55.160]  We must bring them to justice.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:04.347]  And just start identifying the shadow government and the deep state and the private offshore corporate criminal networks that are engaged in a global corporate takeover known as the New World Order.
[00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:12.434]  And if we just continue to hammer that in and get the word out, over 75% of Americans in a Gallup poll want to audit or abolish the Fed or both.
[00:10:13.014 --> 00:10:20.940]  So we're beginning to have more and more victories and people that wouldn't listen to us 10, 20, 30 years ago, 45 years ago when you first got started, they're now listening now.
[00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:24.642]  And it's all because of people like you, Bob Chapman, and all the fighters out there.
[00:10:24.722 --> 00:10:27.522]  So everything you do, folks, is part of this incremental battle.
[00:10:27.562 --> 00:10:29.323]  Many hands make light work.
[00:10:29.423 --> 00:10:31.403]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:10:31.683 --> 00:10:33.304]  I want to do a full hour with you next week.
[00:10:33.324 --> 00:10:33.804]  Can you do that?
[00:10:34.804 --> 00:10:35.504]  Absolutely.
[00:10:35.584 --> 00:10:37.065]  And thank you for having me again.
[00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:38.925]  And we are winning.
[00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.225]  We've got them on the run.
[00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:42.686]  And gold over a thousand is a good example.
[00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:44.666]  Absolutely.
[00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:45.807]  God bless you, Bob Chapman.
[00:10:46.487 --> 00:10:46.967]  Same to you.
[00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:47.447]  Bye-bye.
[00:10:47.767 --> 00:10:48.407]  Take care, my friend.
[00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.768]  Bob, Jaren just popped in my ear, one of the producers.
[00:10:50.788 --> 00:10:51.048]  What's that?
[00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:56.620]  All right, at 19.50, I'm going to skip this network break.
[00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:59.303]  So stations will be carrying it because it's not their break.
[00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:03.426]  There's local breaks, network breaks, listeners always ask what I'm talking about when I say that.
[00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:09.692]  We're going to skip the 20 to 24 long break because I want to be able to play, to analyze it.
[00:11:09.832 --> 00:11:11.493]  It's bad audio, but it's the best we got.
[00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:19.040]  Somebody sent it to us, recorded off a radio, I guess, with like a tape recorder of Limbaugh with Mark Dice calling in just an hour or so ago.
[00:11:20.109 --> 00:11:29.938]  And we're going to play that, then we're going to go into the video, audio for listeners, of this incredible mega-viral video Aaron Dykes produced that I shot the video of with Charlie Sheen.
[00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:33.881]  I'm very proud of this video that I directed, but that Aaron put together.
[00:11:34.282 --> 00:11:35.203]  He did Yeoman's work.
[00:11:35.983 --> 00:11:39.346]  And this is Charlie Sheen's video message to the President.
[00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:46.492]  So we're going to go ahead and go to Limbaugh, then to the message to the President from Charlie Sheen.
[00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:46.793]  Here it is.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.746]  A little love roller coaster.
[00:11:52.806 --> 00:11:53.989]  That's the Ohio Players.
[00:11:54.129 --> 00:11:54.631]  We're back.
[00:11:54.691 --> 00:11:56.435]  Rush Limbaugh here at EIV Network.
[00:11:56.556 --> 00:11:57.398]  Open line Friday.
[00:11:57.418 --> 00:11:58.461]  We're going to start on the phone.
[00:11:58.501 --> 00:11:59.102]  San Diego.
[00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.631]  Mark, thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:02.491]  Nice to have you here with us.
[00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:03.592]  Thanks, Rush.
[00:12:03.632 --> 00:12:20.560]  I'm wondering what you and your establishment friends are going to do now that over one-third of Americans from both political parties believe that the attacks of 9-11 were an inside job, and your propaganda and your gatekeeping is not having the effect that you and your puppet masters thought it would.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.981]  Well, you know something, Mark?
[00:12:23.001 --> 00:12:28.244]  What that tells me is that we're losing one-third of the country to a bunch of insane lunatics.
[00:12:29.418 --> 00:12:31.179]  And 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:34.319]  I saw an interview, Mark, with Charlie Sheen.
[00:12:34.359 --> 00:12:36.520]  Charlie Sheen got 20 minutes with Barack Obama.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.460]  I read the transcript.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.141]  And Charlie Sheen said, hey, a prisoner's a prisoner.
[00:12:40.161 --> 00:12:41.902]  Don't you realize 9-11 was an inside job?
[00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:44.402]  And Obama didn't want to go there.
[00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:53.105]  If you can't get the leader of your kooks to go along with what you kooks believe, then I would say that you've got a kook cause.
[00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:54.425]  9-11, an inside job.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.662]  I fear for a country because of such insanity.
[00:13:01.503 --> 00:13:04.225]  And I've talked about the fact that we're two or three countries today.
[00:13:05.026 --> 00:13:09.609]  And I have no illusion that I have any ability to reach the insane.
[00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:14.033]  I have no ability that I have any sway over lunatics.
[00:13:15.454 --> 00:13:17.015]  And frankly, I don't even try.
[00:13:18.637 --> 00:13:22.180]  What I'm trying to do is make sure that the number of lunatics
[00:13:23.166 --> 00:13:34.737]  The numbers of the genuinely politically insane remain as small as one-third, so that you will forever remain the stupid idiot minority that you are.
[00:13:36.378 --> 00:13:38.540]  You know something, folks?
[00:13:40.162 --> 00:13:46.547]  If George Bush were president today, let's say it's 2007, and it's the sixth anniversary of 9-11.
[00:13:47.834 --> 00:14:07.681]  And if George Bush were president, remember now the Iraq war still going on, coming up on the surge, and this training exercise had happened, do you think, and Bush was, let's say, everything's the same except Bush is president, he's at the Pentagon, he's doing a memorial at the Pentagon, and the Coast Guard runs his training exercise.
[00:14:10.418 --> 00:14:12.379]  Uh, you know what the drive-bys would report?
[00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:20.741]  That Bush faked and staged and purposely did this exercise to scare everybody to death, to realize we have real problems and to get everybody trying to support Iraq.
[00:14:20.781 --> 00:14:22.441]  They would say that Bush was behind it.
[00:14:22.981 --> 00:14:24.562]  You're lunatic friends, Mark.
[00:14:24.602 --> 00:14:26.222]  You're kook insaniacs.
[00:14:26.302 --> 00:14:28.463]  That would be your take on it.
[00:14:28.823 --> 00:14:29.683]  What do we get today?
[00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:30.523]  Oh no!
[00:14:30.723 --> 00:14:31.643]  Oh no, CNN!
[00:14:32.284 --> 00:14:33.644]  Oh no, the Infobank decree!
[00:14:33.704 --> 00:14:34.584]  Obamacare!
[00:14:34.704 --> 00:14:35.604]  Obamacare!
[00:14:36.005 --> 00:14:36.265]  Ah, man!
[00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:37.445]  Led them to
[00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:45.034]  The most embarrassing hour or two of reporting probably this week for CNN.
[00:14:45.074 --> 00:14:49.499]  I mean, you have to categorize CNN's embarrassments by the week.
[00:14:50.767 --> 00:14:52.368]  No warning signs that I'm aware of.
[00:14:52.388 --> 00:14:56.111]  It was a revelation that the White House had no intention of making public.
[00:14:56.131 --> 00:15:02.375]  President Bush was told in August that Osama Bin Laden might be planning an attack involving a hijacker.
[00:15:02.415 --> 00:15:05.036]  Nobody in our government at least.
[00:15:05.177 --> 00:15:10.240]  I believe the title was Bin Laden determined to attack inside the United States.
[00:15:12.215 --> 00:15:16.379]  70% of family members' questions were never answered during the 9-11 Commission Report.
[00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:19.062]  Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean said they were set up to fail.
[00:15:19.082 --> 00:15:20.243]  I mean, I remember the Commission.
[00:15:20.443 --> 00:15:21.104]  It's a scam.
[00:15:21.204 --> 00:15:22.645]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[00:15:23.386 --> 00:15:25.028]  The questions, Mr. President.
[00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:26.549]  The questions.
[00:15:29.192 --> 00:15:33.376]  Building 7 ablaze at the moment and apparently getting ready to collapse.
[00:15:34.036 --> 00:15:34.376]  Building 7.
[00:15:35.638 --> 00:15:38.179]  Well, no, there's number seven coming down.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:46.944]  The excitement and the fun that people get watching an old building being demolished, and they wired very carefully for days, and it's a very careful operation.
[00:15:46.964 --> 00:15:57.509]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:59.370]  One of the things they do is pull it.
[00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.272]  And they made that decision to pull, that we watch the building.
[00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:09.194]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:16:09.394 --> 00:16:11.455]  Well, only really what you already know.
[00:16:11.515 --> 00:16:13.195]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[00:16:13.235 --> 00:16:22.539]  We're getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7 in the World Trade Center complex, is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.881]  The Pentagon.
[00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:27.941]  Vanishing Airplane.
[00:16:28.576 --> 00:16:34.159]  My close-up inspection, there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon.
[00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:44.104]  The only sight is the actual side of the building that's crashed in, and as I said, the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you could pick up in your hand.
[00:16:44.624 --> 00:16:54.649]  There are no large tail sections, wing sections, fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around, which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon.
[00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.331]  Firefighters and police
[00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.571]  Describing explosions.
[00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:01.191]  A lot of them.
[00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:02.912]  The secondary explosion.
[00:17:02.952 --> 00:17:06.473]  We've got numerous people covered with dust from the secondary explosion.
[00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:08.154]  Floor by floor, it's sort of popping out.
[00:17:08.234 --> 00:17:09.995]  It was like, it was if, if, if they had detonated.
[00:17:10.115 --> 00:17:10.815]  Yeah, detonated.
[00:17:10.935 --> 00:17:12.596]  As if they were planning to take down a building.
[00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:13.896]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:15.577]  Looks sort of like the building just demolished.
[00:17:16.197 --> 00:17:18.598]  Even if there was no secondary explosives in the building.
[00:17:18.658 --> 00:17:19.759]  It sounded like gunfire.
[00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:21.340]  You know, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.061]  And then, and then all of a sudden, three big explosions.
[00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:26.822]  Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse?
[00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:31.917]  To me it sounded like an explosion.
[00:17:31.937 --> 00:17:45.865]  Chief Albert Turrey told me that he tried to get his men out as quickly as he could, but he said that there was another explosion which took place, and then an hour after there was another explosion in one of the towers here.
[00:17:49.547 --> 00:17:53.529]  Cybele Edmonds, FBI translator, breaking her gag order.
[00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.131]  All our intimate relationship with Bin Laden and Taliban.
[00:17:58.272 --> 00:18:05.034]  We did carry very intimate relationship with these people all the way up to September 11th.
[00:18:05.054 --> 00:18:10.556]  Bin Laden was spirited into this military hospital in Rawalpindi for kidney dialysis treatment.
[00:18:10.676 --> 00:18:12.117]  The military had him surrounded.
[00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:16.398]  They were saying that Osama Bin Laden had to be watched carefully and looked after.
[00:18:18.399 --> 00:18:19.899]  NORAD standing down.
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.620]  Where were the planes?
[00:18:25.316 --> 00:18:28.338]  On now to one of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9-11.
[00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:31.579]  A mysterious plane was seen flying right over the president's residence.
[00:18:31.659 --> 00:18:33.720]  The E-4Bs over New York and Washington.
[00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:36.662]  Otherwise known as the Doomsday Planes.
[00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:38.323]  It has never been officially explained.
[00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:41.865]  Cell phones working at impossible altitudes.
[00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:49.869]  Solicitor General Ted Olson receiving phone calls that the FBI says were never made.
[00:18:50.069 --> 00:18:51.209]  What happened during that call?
[00:18:51.229 --> 00:18:54.171]  This is the only information we have on these terrorists.
[00:18:56.329 --> 00:18:58.371]  She was able to call him twice.
[00:18:58.531 --> 00:19:01.313]  How she could pull that off, we don't know, but she did.
[00:19:02.554 --> 00:19:04.035]  These are the questions, Mr. President.
[00:19:05.036 --> 00:19:05.797]  These are the questions.
[00:19:06.597 --> 00:19:08.218]  They go on and on.
[00:19:12.162 --> 00:19:13.402]  Good afternoon, Mr. President.
[00:19:14.804 --> 00:19:21.889]  I come to you today representing the families of the victims of September 11th, as well as millions of my fellow Americans.
[00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.472]  Hopefully by now you've had a chance to read my letter
[00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:34.793]  We have questions, Mr. President.
[00:19:34.813 --> 00:19:37.576]  Lots of questions.
[00:19:37.596 --> 00:19:40.939]  A lot of them are detailed in my letter.
[00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:44.682]  But trust me, there are hundreds more questions.
[00:19:46.624 --> 00:19:53.670]  As my letter chronicles, sir, the 9-11 Commission itself says they were lied to, deceived, and
[00:19:54.542 --> 00:19:57.583]  essentially prevented from carrying out a real investigation.
[00:19:57.603 --> 00:20:02.566]  The people of the United States and the world demand the truth, sir.
[00:20:03.026 --> 00:20:04.306]  We have to continuously ask questions.
[00:20:04.326 --> 00:20:05.427]  That's what a patriot does.
[00:20:05.447 --> 00:20:06.548]  That's what a true American does.
[00:20:06.608 --> 00:20:10.329]  We ask questions.
[00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:22.935]  You, sir, have the power as well as the responsibility to initiate a truly independent congressional investigation into the events of 9-11 as well as its aftermath.
[00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.672]  We want our country back, Mr. President.
[00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:34.019]  Therefore, I'm not just calling on you and your team, I'm calling on each and every American citizen to wake up, stand up, and demand the truth.
[00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:36.822]  We're counting on you, Mr. President.
[00:20:37.563 --> 00:20:38.624]  We'll be on the right side of history.
[00:20:58.539 --> 00:21:02.340]  Are you now saying that they weren't asking you to block an investigation?
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:09.143]  An investigation must not interfere with the ongoing efforts to prevent the next attack.
[00:21:09.583 --> 00:21:15.766]  Senator Tom Daschle said last week that you called him several times and urged him not to investigate the events of September 11th.
[00:21:15.786 --> 00:21:16.386]  Tom is wrong.
[00:21:16.466 --> 00:21:21.128]  He has, I think in this case, let's say a misinterpretation.
[00:21:22.952 --> 00:21:25.993]  The chickens are coming home to roost for the New World Order.
[00:21:26.933 --> 00:21:30.675]  Charlie Sheen's message to the President is being seen by tens of millions right now.
[00:21:31.015 --> 00:21:32.676]  Charlie Sheen coming up live.
[00:21:32.696 --> 00:21:35.417]  ABC, CNN, others have called.
[00:21:35.437 --> 00:21:39.118]  They're listening live to carry it later when he comes on with us.
[00:21:39.238 --> 00:21:41.959]  Charlie Sheen live on September 11, 2009.
[00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:44.940]  Eight years after the false flag terror attacks.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.041]  With big announcements and challenges.
[00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:49.022]  This is going to be extremely powerful.
[00:21:49.362 --> 00:21:49.862]  Stay with us.
[00:21:52.219 --> 00:21:55.201]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:56.142 --> 00:21:58.944]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.105 --> 00:22:06.288]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:22:06.429 --> 00:22:10.791]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:22:10.952 --> 00:22:12.813]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:22:13.233 --> 00:22:14.594]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:22:14.854 --> 00:22:15.875]  There is a solution.
[00:22:16.115 --> 00:22:24.121]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:32.051]  We're good.
[00:24:04.082 --> 00:24:06.705]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:09.427]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[00:24:09.807 --> 00:24:13.110]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:19.897]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese, and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[00:24:20.237 --> 00:24:20.677]  We're good to go!
[00:24:41.544 --> 00:24:42.825]  Celebrating the win of a ball game.
[00:24:43.145 --> 00:24:47.648]  And if it's this great during the good times, imagine how reassuring it will be if times get tough.

[00:24:55.032 --> 00:24:55.833]  All the leaves are brown.
[00:24:55.873 --> 00:24:56.413]  And the sky is gray.
[00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:57.454]  And the sky is gray.
[00:25:14.443 --> 00:25:21.254]  It is September 11, 2009, eight years after the tragic events that hit New York and Washington, D.C.
[00:25:22.055 --> 00:25:23.838]  Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[00:25:23.858 --> 00:25:25.581]  government plan to stage terror attacks in U.S.
[00:25:25.621 --> 00:25:29.186]  cities to start a foreign war with Cuba and the Soviets.
[00:25:30.009 --> 00:25:34.011]  Operation Ajax staging terror attacks in Iran to blame it on their government, declassified.
[00:25:34.291 --> 00:25:40.953]  Gulf of Tonkin admittedly staged to get us into the Vietnam War that killed over a million Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans.
[00:25:41.814 --> 00:25:43.454]  False flag terror is real.
[00:25:43.955 --> 00:25:51.818]  But Charlie Sheen of Platoon and Wall Street and Major League and of course the number one top paid TV star
[00:25:53.154 --> 00:25:58.318]  Charlie Sheen is simply asking questions, and he's with us now into the bottom of the next hour.
[00:25:58.458 --> 00:26:07.065]  For a full hour today, Bob McIlvain, who lost his son in the towers, will be joining us coming up later in the next hour of the last 15 minutes of this interview.
[00:26:07.425 --> 00:26:11.228]  Joining us from his home in Los Angeles is Charlie Sheen.
[00:26:11.288 --> 00:26:12.689]  Charlie, thanks for being with us.
[00:26:12.929 --> 00:26:13.990]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.252]  It's great to be here, as usual.
[00:26:16.972 --> 00:26:21.756]  I think right off the top, we need to take a moment of silence.
[00:26:22.227 --> 00:26:27.429]  A lot of people lost their lives, a lot of people lost loved ones on that day and it is important to remember them.
[00:26:45.683 --> 00:26:56.508]  Charlie, political whores like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and others, their attack plan is to say that you're besmirching the memory of those that died.
[00:26:57.109 --> 00:27:02.632]  When I've interviewed Bill Doyle, the head of the Biggest Families group, saying the majority of them believe it's an inside job.
[00:27:02.672 --> 00:27:03.092]  He does.
[00:27:03.392 --> 00:27:06.574]  Bob McIlvain, they've protested around the White House and Ground Zero.
[00:27:06.614 --> 00:27:07.894]  The media ignores them.
[00:27:08.575 --> 00:27:10.616]  Your letter and your request
[00:27:11.636 --> 00:27:17.477]  Has been about having a meeting with the President and taking these victims' family members there to the White House.
[00:27:18.497 --> 00:27:25.198]  But the media is involved in this hoax, saying the family is all by the official story, when six of the ten Commission members say it's a complete fraud.
[00:27:26.719 --> 00:27:32.179]  Yeah, no, well I guess it's, you know, this is indicative of the times that we live in.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.320]  If people don't hear it on television, then it must not be true.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.021]  You know, which is a sad state of affairs.
[00:27:42.008 --> 00:28:05.796]  You know, I think we should talk about the fact that I reached out to the White House, that I sent an email to Press Secretary Gibbs, and I got a call back from his deputy, Mr. Burton, and he said, out of respect to him, I don't believe in playing people's voice messages, you know, airing them publicly, but he said that
[00:28:06.829 --> 00:28:12.651]  He would get back to me, but he doesn't feel that this thing is going to happen, meaning my actual sit-down with the President.
[00:28:14.172 --> 00:28:32.139]  And so, I wrote them again, and I said, you know, I asked if I could, you know, as an ambassador to the families, meet with the President, with Bob McElveen in particular, representing their voice.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.660]  I haven't heard back yet.
[00:28:35.558 --> 00:28:49.221]  But I did in my email state that if the President denies this request, I would at the very least expect a letter with him detailing his decision to not do so.
[00:28:52.421 --> 00:28:54.942]  Still waiting to hear back.
[00:28:57.362 --> 00:28:58.623]  I understand they got their hands full.
[00:28:58.923 --> 00:29:05.144]  There's a lot of issues that they're tackling, but I don't really think that they're any more important than what we're trying to address here.
[00:29:06.618 --> 00:29:08.399]  Yeah, they're busy staging events.
[00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:13.781]  It turned out the White House had ordered the New York police not to tell the mayor about the flyby.
[00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:16.623]  Air Force One photo-op triggers panic in Manhattan.
[00:29:16.943 --> 00:29:19.824]  Turned out the White House ran that to create some type of psy-op.
[00:29:20.185 --> 00:29:26.508]  Now you have this drill run by the Coast Guard with the media covering it like it's real, just a mile from where he's giving a speech.
[00:29:26.568 --> 00:29:35.172]  But he has now lovingly reassured us that everything's okay, but reminded us of how wicked the cave dwellers are and how we better give up all our rights or they'll get us.
[00:29:36.348 --> 00:29:41.793]  Yeah, yeah, I know, because these guys in a cave in Afghanistan with a satellite phone can get Norad to stand down.
[00:29:41.893 --> 00:29:42.174]  Wow.
[00:29:43.635 --> 00:29:45.197]  They're more powerful than we ever imagined.
[00:29:46.037 --> 00:29:50.982]  As far as that flyby, didn't any of these clowns ever heard of Photoshop?
[00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:52.384]  I don't know.
[00:29:52.564 --> 00:29:56.347]  Call me crazy, it just seemed a much easier and cheaper solution.
[00:29:57.244 --> 00:29:58.765]  Well, it turned out it wasn't a photo-op.
[00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:00.766]  There was a psy-op the White House ran.
[00:30:01.986 --> 00:30:04.207]  And that's hidden in plain view, and that's clearly what's happening here.
[00:30:04.247 --> 00:30:08.069]  But yeah, they could have gotten a photo-op for Air Force One over New York.
[00:30:08.089 --> 00:30:08.649]  Give me a break.
[00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.191]  Let's talk about that media spin.
[00:30:13.472 --> 00:30:15.833]  You wrote the letter so they would focus on the 20 points.
[00:30:15.913 --> 00:30:24.197]  Talk about that, and then please expand on the fact that they continue to put words in your mouth and misrepresent what you're saying.
[00:30:25.339 --> 00:30:29.361]  Well, yeah, I mean, but I anticipated this.
[00:30:30.081 --> 00:30:34.183]  I didn't know that it would be this egregious, that it would be this blatant.
[00:30:35.944 --> 00:30:39.586]  You know, I wrote the letter to get people's attention.
[00:30:40.447 --> 00:30:42.027]  Oh my God, did this really happen?
[00:30:42.127 --> 00:30:43.948]  And then, bang, there's all the data.
[00:30:45.329 --> 00:30:49.811]  And so I think it had the effect that I had hoped for, and even more so.
[00:30:51.392 --> 00:30:52.893]  But the media right now is really...
[00:30:54.324 --> 00:30:58.667]  Really showing their ignorance as well as their true colors.
[00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:21.422]  Because I haven't read one hit piece, one article, online or otherwise, that after attacking me personally, they then never go on to say, well we've looked at your 20 bullet points and here's why they're completely invalid and based in fiction.
[00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:30.453]  I think that we put something out there that is so powerful that they can't figure out a way to disassemble it this time.
[00:31:30.993 --> 00:31:45.219]  They're doing all their research, and they're looking in all their archives, and rather than rolling out some experts or really looking at the facts and saying, well, this is questionable or that's questionable, we've really tied their hands.
[00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:50.300]  So all they can do is attack me personally.
[00:31:53.839 --> 00:31:54.820]  It's sad.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:55.620]  It's sad.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.282]  I mean, I actually kind of feel bad for these people.
[00:31:58.322 --> 00:31:59.122]  That's all they got?
[00:31:59.142 --> 00:32:01.343]  Like, oh, he did this, this, and this.
[00:32:01.444 --> 00:32:02.084]  Okay, all right.
[00:32:02.424 --> 00:32:02.884]  Keep going.
[00:32:03.285 --> 00:32:03.905]  Yeah, I did that.
[00:32:03.965 --> 00:32:04.305]  Okay.
[00:32:04.345 --> 00:32:04.946]  Might have done that.
[00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:05.406]  Whatever.
[00:32:05.946 --> 00:32:06.747]  Let's get to the fact.
[00:32:06.807 --> 00:32:09.368]  And they just don't get there.
[00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:16.292]  But I think what we need to mention, Alex, is that we need to really thank all the readers that have commented, that have
[00:32:23.837 --> 00:32:40.022]  He really supported me in the comment sections on a lot of these articles because they themselves point out that it is clearly obvious, Mr. or Mrs. whoever, that you did not read his piece.
[00:32:40.062 --> 00:32:41.522]  You did not address any of this.
[00:32:41.642 --> 00:32:44.143]  All you're doing is attacking him personally.
[00:32:45.484 --> 00:32:46.524]  It's just so predictable.
[00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:57.360]  Well, Charlie Sheen, TakeMilitary.com, dozens of comments, I only saw two that were against you and they were mindless and sophomoric.
[00:32:58.081 --> 00:33:01.426]  The other comments, even though the story was a hit piece, said, look,
[00:33:02.614 --> 00:33:09.918]  His article does have a link to the Washington Post with six of the ten commission members saying it's a cover-up, a lie.
[00:33:09.938 --> 00:33:14.021]  There needs to be a criminal investigation of the Pentagon and the White House.
[00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:19.844]  And when I talked to you last night, you wanted to specifically get into that.
[00:33:19.884 --> 00:33:20.605]  We will later.
[00:33:20.645 --> 00:33:28.629]  But first off, what about Cheney and the false flag stuff that came out from Cy Hirsch and even MSNBC?
[00:33:28.649 --> 00:33:29.470]  Tell folks about that.
[00:33:30.145 --> 00:33:56.421]  Well I think people need to really, really look at the connection, look at the reality between the fact that this is the same man that concocted this outrageous plan as reported by Seymour Hersh, which is detailed in the letter for a false flag stage provocation to bring us into the Iranian conflict.
[00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:59.783]  And so people really need to look at that and really need to
[00:34:00.327 --> 00:34:21.253]  To look at the outline of the measure of this insanity, and then also take note that this is the same guy who violated or usurped a 51-year standing protocol to seize shoot-down power from the generals at NORAD.
[00:34:22.113 --> 00:34:28.575]  So the guy that came up with the insane Strait of Hormuz plan is the guy on 9-11
[00:34:29.844 --> 00:34:32.867]  The only guy in the known universe with shoot-down power.
[00:34:34.368 --> 00:34:36.550]  And nobody's talking about that.
[00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:41.213]  Everybody's talking about, you know, my past exploits.
[00:34:42.294 --> 00:34:44.156]  So on and so forth.
[00:34:44.256 --> 00:34:45.297]  I don't have any credibility.
[00:34:45.865 --> 00:34:49.787]  They're just jealous as if the Pentagon boys don't have any exploits.
[00:34:50.528 --> 00:34:53.189]  Hookers are more ubiquitous than water fountains in D.C.
[00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:54.650]  Bill Clinton.
[00:34:54.670 --> 00:35:13.261]  But the point is, expanding on this, sir, and not what you did when you were 25, expanding on this, it's Dick Cheney that wrote the PNAC document September 20, 2000, saying we need a big Pearl Harbor event, a big terror attack, a catalyzing event to launch our global domination.
[00:35:14.062 --> 00:35:26.754]  Yes, which people will notice that's observed through the voice of the President in my piece and not by myself, which I think was key.
[00:35:28.806 --> 00:35:30.567]  Tell folks why you had the idea.
[00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:32.289]  This was all your idea, and I think it was genius.
[00:35:32.949 --> 00:35:34.070]  Brilliant, as many have said.
[00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:42.496]  Looking at the piece, different literature sites, Hollywood sites, even some that disagree with you are looking at it and saying this is a really well-written, 16-page script.
[00:35:43.216 --> 00:35:47.640]  How did you get the idea to have it 20 minutes with the President, and then put it out the way we did?
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:52.603]  Well, gosh, there were a couple of factors.
[00:35:53.344 --> 00:35:57.267]  There was a piece written by Aaron Sorkin, I believe it was in the Washington Post,
[00:35:58.726 --> 00:36:09.230]  Over a year ago, and it was a fictional meeting between Obama and my father's character, President Barlet from the West Wing.
[00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:17.872]  Obama goes to him after Dad's out of office and asks for advice on the upcoming term, etc.
[00:36:18.473 --> 00:36:21.374]  I thought it was interesting.
[00:36:21.414 --> 00:36:22.294]  I thought it was fun.
[00:36:22.314 --> 00:36:25.675]  I thought it was cute and really well written.
[00:36:28.777 --> 00:36:36.859]  A few months ago, I just woke up with the title in my head, 20 Minutes with the President, and I just started thinking, what is this about?
[00:36:36.919 --> 00:36:37.439]  What is this?
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:47.782]  And I started formulating this image of President Obama and myself sitting down and having a discussion.
[00:36:47.802 --> 00:36:49.362]  And I thought, well, what's the discussion about?
[00:36:49.402 --> 00:36:50.763]  What am I really passionate about?
[00:36:50.783 --> 00:36:54.264]  And the discussion's about 9-11 and about a new investigation.
[00:36:56.499 --> 00:37:03.864]  And then I got into it, and I lost focus, I lost momentum, I kind of lost my passion for the piece.
[00:37:04.124 --> 00:37:10.189]  And I watched a documentary called Press for Truth.
[00:37:10.529 --> 00:37:12.610]  It was about the Jersey Girls and the Family Steering Committee.
[00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:21.797]  And there was a gentleman I interviewed in there, Bob McElbane, and I just found something
[00:37:24.059 --> 00:37:26.420]  So powerful about his message.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:38.866]  So completely disarming and really poignant to all of these feelings that I had and all these thoughts I had about the peace.
[00:37:39.046 --> 00:37:52.752]  And so I discovered my motivation in that moment because I thought to myself, if this gentleman, if this man who is living a life of this much sorrow can wake up one day and just
[00:37:53.737 --> 00:38:03.083]  Just for that day, feel a little bit better about the state of things because of the work that I've done, because of the voice that I've utilized to bring attention to this.
[00:38:03.563 --> 00:38:07.666]  If I can do that for him, just one guy, then I've done something good.
[00:38:07.686 --> 00:38:10.268]  I've done something that matters.
[00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:12.623]  And of course, that's beautiful, Charlie.
[00:38:12.944 --> 00:38:18.392]  Bob lost his son and he's now raising their grandson with he and his wife.
[00:38:18.412 --> 00:38:20.575]  He's going to be on with us later in the next hour.
[00:38:20.635 --> 00:38:26.043]  To paraphrase what you told me when you called me and said you wanted me to come out and work with you on this piece, I was very honored.
[00:38:27.588 --> 00:38:29.189]  Yeah, but I think, you know, Alex, people need to know.
[00:38:56.132 --> 00:39:10.323]  How integral you were to this process, that I called on you as my research expert, as my point man on that front, to really help me make this thing bulletproof.
[00:39:10.663 --> 00:39:21.891]  If you look at what you brought to it, and what we've done together, I think it really speaks to the fact that they can't, as I said earlier, disassemble this thing.
[00:39:22.532 --> 00:39:24.633]  Because it's bulletproof.
[00:39:26.773 --> 00:39:34.179]  It's rooted in fact that we have collected from all of the mainstream arms of media.
[00:39:34.879 --> 00:39:41.965]  And so that's what's pissing them off right now is that we're using all the stuff that they published and now they can't refute it, you know?
[00:39:42.802 --> 00:39:56.212]  And it's ridiculous that Limbaugh, when it's all over the news in hundreds of papers, first line in the Times of London, LA Times, everywhere, that it was a mock letter of the points you'd like to bring to him.
[00:39:56.653 --> 00:40:01.336]  Kind of a vehicle to publicly give Obama the data, and there's no doubt the White House has read it and seen it.
[00:40:01.356 --> 00:40:01.997]  You've talked to them.
[00:40:03.418 --> 00:40:08.462]  Now, moving on here, I want to later get back into the next phase with the White House
[00:40:09.881 --> 00:40:17.365]  A declaration of arms in the Peaceful Info War, to stand up for 9-11 truth and demand a new congressional, truly independent commission.
[00:40:17.425 --> 00:40:19.706]  But, specifically talking about media.
[00:40:19.726 --> 00:40:21.226]  Sure.
[00:40:22.007 --> 00:40:27.169]  There was one particular show, The View, and you've got a challenge for somebody.
[00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:29.290]  Yes, I do, Alex.
[00:40:30.891 --> 00:40:34.072]  Meghan McCain, John McCain's daughter, I guess, was on The View.
[00:40:34.412 --> 00:40:37.274]  I don't watch the shows, but I only read the transcript.
[00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:48.605]  She had some pretty, gosh, uneducated, uninformed comments about my piece, or about me personally.
[00:40:48.785 --> 00:40:49.926]  She wasn't even talking about the piece.
[00:40:51.306 --> 00:40:59.610]  I just got to believe, Alec, that if I was sitting right next to her, that her tone would have been a lot different.
[00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:06.753]  But if she's such an expert on me, first of all, and on
[00:41:09.224 --> 00:41:13.811]  On the event, secondly, I would welcome her to an open debate.
[00:41:15.493 --> 00:41:17.496]  Just take the time and the place and I'll be there early.
[00:41:18.117 --> 00:41:20.781]  She better pack her lunch because it's going to take some time.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:31.372]  And specifically, when we come back after this quick break, we'll detail it because there's a whole backstory with CNN and Larry King Live going on and what's happening there.
[00:41:31.612 --> 00:41:40.744]  And so officially, in your own words, you are challenging Meghan McCain to a debate on Larry King Live next week.
[00:41:41.223 --> 00:41:45.164]  Well, Larry King wouldn't schedule the piece because they couldn't find somebody to represent the other side.
[00:41:45.224 --> 00:41:51.445]  So now that Meghan McCain has come out as an expert on me, and on September 11th, um, yeah, no, let's invite her out there.
[00:41:51.825 --> 00:41:56.766]  Let's see what she's got, because I'm coming out there, I'm coming out there with my letter, I'm coming out there with the facts, I'm coming out there with the truth.
[00:41:57.086 --> 00:41:58.306]  I don't know what she's coming out there with.
[00:41:58.587 --> 00:41:59.947]  Maybe she's promoting a book, I don't know.
[00:42:00.567 --> 00:42:05.628]  But, uh, but this is a lot more important than, you know, Pulp Fiction.
[00:42:06.368 --> 00:42:11.909]  And you want to bring Bob McIlvain and she can bring the Stooges from Popper Mechanics if she wants.
[00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:18.391]  The problem is, Popper Mechanics, CNN told me in a separate deal, they wanted to have me on a couple years ago with Popper Mechanics.
[00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:19.631]  Popper Mechanics won't do it.
[00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:21.591]  They won't debate anybody from Loose Change.
[00:42:21.971 --> 00:42:23.512]  They have to have it all to themselves.
[00:42:23.572 --> 00:42:25.092]  These cowards are called out.
[00:42:26.172 --> 00:42:31.153]  They need to come debate you with Meghan McCain next week on Larry King Live.
[00:42:31.634 --> 00:42:32.974]  She can bring her dad.
[00:42:33.074 --> 00:42:33.634]  She can bring
[00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:41.151]  The ex-Vice President, she can bring whatever she wants, but as I said, you know, don't bring in the truth.
[00:42:43.143 --> 00:42:44.104]  And Bob McElveen.
[00:42:44.424 --> 00:42:45.766]  And Bob McElveen, yeah.
[00:42:45.866 --> 00:42:48.268]  And Charlie will do this debate anywhere in L.A.
[00:42:48.909 --> 00:42:50.370]  on television if it's live.
[00:42:50.491 --> 00:42:52.373]  He will not allow him to censor it or cut him off.
[00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:53.774]  He's sick and tired of that.
[00:42:53.914 --> 00:42:54.435]  You heard it.
[00:42:54.775 --> 00:42:57.478]  He's calling you out, you cowards at Popular Mechanics.
[00:42:58.058 --> 00:43:03.384]  John McCain wrote the intro hit piece on me in the Popular Mechanics book.
[00:43:03.604 --> 00:43:04.885]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[00:43:05.025 --> 00:43:06.327]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[00:43:06.707 --> 00:43:08.188]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[00:43:08.528 --> 00:43:13.130]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:18.093]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[00:44:05.235 --> 00:44:08.677]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:44:08.837 --> 00:44:10.698]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:44:11.318 --> 00:44:14.059]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:19.882]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:44:20.162 --> 00:44:23.524]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet
[00:44:23.524 --> 00:44:23.844]  We're good to go.

[00:46:38.905 --> 00:46:43.046]  Bob McIlvain coming up in about 15 minutes.
[00:46:43.166 --> 00:46:44.767]  Charlie Sheen, stay with us into the next hour.
[00:46:45.627 --> 00:46:48.748]  Charlie, specifically, I was talking to you during the break.
[00:46:48.908 --> 00:46:50.049]  You want to issue the challenge.
[00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.469]  Go ahead.
[00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:52.590]  Let's do it.
[00:46:53.250 --> 00:47:00.172]  I issue the challenge to debate Meghan McCain, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly.
[00:47:00.893 --> 00:47:01.333]  Bring them all.
[00:47:02.509 --> 00:47:05.251]  Bob McIlwain and I will join you on Larry King Live.
[00:47:06.112 --> 00:47:07.574]  And you guys bring whatever you got.
[00:47:07.874 --> 00:47:08.815]  Bring popular mechanics.
[00:47:09.655 --> 00:47:10.756]  Let's call them out as well.
[00:47:11.557 --> 00:47:13.739]  And we'll show up with the truth and we'll just see how it goes.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:15.681]  We're not hiding.
[00:47:16.561 --> 00:47:17.042]  We're not hiding.
[00:47:20.714 --> 00:47:29.479]  Charlie Limbaugh, even though every news article said it was a mock letter to give your information to Obama to get his attention, every article out there says it was a mock letter.
[00:47:29.539 --> 00:47:34.823]  Limbaugh said it was real today and said Obama really met with you and called him the head truther.
[00:47:36.323 --> 00:47:37.624]  Interesting.
[00:47:38.044 --> 00:47:39.806]  Interesting.
[00:47:39.866 --> 00:47:48.811]  Yeah, that seems a little irresponsible for a guy that, you know, it's his job to research the news that he's reporting.
[00:47:51.189 --> 00:47:52.570]  That was the old description, I guess.
[00:47:54.431 --> 00:48:01.295]  Yeah, but again, again, I think it's, you know, with those hit pieces, with the pinhead stuff, and whatever else I was told about it.
[00:48:03.056 --> 00:48:09.940]  It's just a classic bullying syndrome, you know?
[00:48:10.181 --> 00:48:14.563]  Oftentimes, you'll discover that the bully is really the most scared kid on the playground.
[00:48:14.583 --> 00:48:18.145]  It doesn't reveal that until he's confronted, you know?
[00:48:18.205 --> 00:48:19.246]  And these people are going to keep
[00:48:19.673 --> 00:48:21.054]  You're throwing down the gauntlet?
[00:48:41.274 --> 00:48:45.278]  You know, we were having a discussion at your house, and we were both on the same page.
[00:48:45.298 --> 00:48:51.685]  I mean, I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night just thinking, my God, if they lied about 9-11, everything else is a lie.
[00:48:51.946 --> 00:48:56.130]  They've been caught lying about WMDs and Yellow Cake and everything else.
[00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.354]  I mean, how can we just let them sweep this under the rug of history?
[00:48:59.394 --> 00:49:02.217]  In fact, you have a line in your letter dealing with that.
[00:49:03.143 --> 00:49:03.744]  Yeah, I do.
[00:49:03.764 --> 00:49:04.404]  I do.
[00:49:04.424 --> 00:49:08.747]  They just, you know, they create the party line.
[00:49:08.767 --> 00:49:18.415]  They say it over and over, as I talk about in the piece, the media mantras, you know, of disrespecting the memories of the victims.
[00:49:18.495 --> 00:49:24.820]  And, you know, it's again, like I said earlier, if it's on television, it must be true, you know.
[00:49:25.641 --> 00:49:28.583]  We've got to get people to smash that paradigm.
[00:49:28.603 --> 00:49:32.226]  We've got to get them to start pulling back the curtain and start calling these people out.
[00:49:33.576 --> 00:49:33.817]  No.
[00:49:34.498 --> 00:49:35.740]  No, this is not how we feel.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.902]  This is not what we believe.
[00:49:36.962 --> 00:49:39.086]  This is not our stance.
[00:49:39.127 --> 00:49:40.529]  Stop misrepresenting us.
[00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:45.619]  Stop telling us, for eight years now, what the truth is about how we feel.
[00:49:47.881 --> 00:50:08.754]  Well, the majority of the victims' families, and the media listening wants me to give them their names, and the majority of the families, what, in polls over 70% that were asked said they didn't like the commission and thought it was a lie, and six of the ten commission members and two of their council members, so a total of eight, say it's a complete fraud and a lie, and that said that there should be criminal investigations of the White House and Pentagon.
[00:50:09.114 --> 00:50:15.198]  I mean, this is in the Washington Post and Associated Press, and we're bad because we're going, hey, the commission says it's a lie?
[00:50:16.297 --> 00:50:24.580]  Yeah, I think that's another part of this whole media spin machine, is that they're now, you know, day two, day three, day four into this thing.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:36.425]  They're taking everything that I have illustrated in the bullet points, and they're putting these as words, thoughts, opinions, theories, from my mouth.
[00:50:37.625 --> 00:50:38.065]  Stay there!
[00:50:38.605 --> 00:50:39.926]  Gotta break, Charlie Sheen.
[00:50:39.966 --> 00:50:41.266]  Stay with us, back in one minute.
[00:50:41.807 --> 00:50:45.668]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for
[00:50:51.642 --> 00:50:54.242]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:50:54.662 --> 00:50:59.624]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:50:59.984 --> 00:51:01.724]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:51:02.044 --> 00:51:06.846]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:51:07.026 --> 00:51:07.946]  How much do you want?
[00:51:08.206 --> 00:51:08.967]  When do you want it?
[00:51:09.348 --> 00:51:10.930]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:12.051]  When will you need it?
[00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:14.374]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:51:14.494 --> 00:51:15.616]  Will there be any food?
[00:51:15.836 --> 00:51:17.178]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:51:17.378 --> 00:51:22.444]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:51:22.645 --> 00:51:25.769]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:51:26.209 --> 00:51:29.710]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:31.010]  How much will you need?
[00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:31.870]  We don't know.
[00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.070]  How much do you want?
[00:51:33.271 --> 00:51:33.991]  All you can get.
[00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:35.031]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:38.052]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:51:38.332 --> 00:51:40.092]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:40.112 --> 00:51:41.032]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:54.278 --> 00:51:56.179]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:56.659 --> 00:51:59.580]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:09.505 --> 00:52:12.226]  It's one of the biggest stories out there right now.
[00:52:12.866 --> 00:52:13.906]  We have retaken 9-11.
[00:52:13.926 --> 00:52:17.408]  The establishment's tried to put out a distorted
[00:52:19.068 --> 00:52:20.789]  Yeah, and then they're, they're, they're putting
[00:52:46.041 --> 00:52:59.250]  You know, words in my mouth, but these are my opinions, my theory, these are my beliefs, and when in fact it's just, you know, it's their, they're drawing from the bullet points and turning them into my words.
[00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:12.219]  And they're now saying that, you know, that I said that the CIA was working with Bin Laden and blah blah blah, so on and so forth, and they're ignoring the fact that that was Sabel Edmonds, FBI translator, who just broke her, her gag order, you know?
[00:53:12.959 --> 00:53:13.860]  And they're saying that, uh,
[00:53:14.693 --> 00:53:32.007]  That I'm insisting this was an inside job orchestrated by the Bush Cabal and so on and so forth, when in fact I'm just pointing out that, uh, you know, that to look at these glaring inconsistencies... Because Alex, let's face it, how many points did you and I go through to come down, to bring it down to 20?
[00:53:32.087 --> 00:53:33.228]  Probably 300.
[00:53:33.908 --> 00:53:35.670]  Probably 300, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:36.851 --> 00:53:38.152]  Should we reveal why it's 20, Alex?
[00:53:42.028 --> 00:53:42.448]  It's 2020.
[00:53:42.929 --> 00:53:44.010]  It's 20 minutes.
[00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:46.132]  It's 20 points.
[00:53:46.393 --> 00:53:46.733]  2020 vision.
[00:53:46.813 --> 00:53:47.434]  What's 9 plus 11?
[00:53:47.554 --> 00:53:47.434]  20.
[00:53:47.614 --> 00:53:48.795]  Yeah.
[00:53:49.676 --> 00:53:51.398]  Ooh, Charlie Sheen, the numerologist.
[00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:53.701]  Ooh, I can hear it now.
[00:53:53.721 --> 00:53:55.523]  No, but it's the establishment that's obsessed with that.
[00:53:55.543 --> 00:53:57.505]  I mean, look.
[00:53:58.786 --> 00:54:04.908]  We have a White House that day one said Iraq did it and it turned out they knew Iraq wasn't involved.
[00:54:04.948 --> 00:54:22.512]  Even if you believe the official story, they premeditatedly, that came out in the White House memo and the Downing Street memos, that's mainstream British news, the White House confirmed that they wanted to shoot down US aircraft or get them shot down to blame it on Saddam, that they knew Saddam wasn't involved, they knew he didn't have yellow cake or nuclear bombs, they knew he didn't have weapons systems.
[00:54:23.152 --> 00:54:25.673]  And they persecuted the inspectors that told the truth.
[00:54:26.033 --> 00:54:30.535]  And so if they'll lie about WMDs and go kill over a million Iraqis and 5,000 U.S.
[00:54:30.555 --> 00:54:31.856]  troops, what else will they do?
[00:54:34.677 --> 00:54:36.678]  I mean, you tell me.
[00:54:37.638 --> 00:54:41.600]  It seems like the record is a little tarnished going in.
[00:54:42.776 --> 00:54:43.596]  A little bit tarnished.
[00:54:43.997 --> 00:54:48.759]  Well, even MSNBC and Sy Hersh reported that Cheney wanted to paint up U.S.
[00:54:48.799 --> 00:54:51.360]  ships like Iranian ships and have them attack our destroyers.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:52.421]  Exactly.
[00:54:52.601 --> 00:54:53.201]  Exactly.
[00:54:53.221 --> 00:54:58.764]  And as we discussed earlier, this is the same guy that was the only person alive that had shoot-down authority.
[00:54:59.224 --> 00:55:02.005]  Had the authority to call for sorties on the hijacked airliners.
[00:55:02.045 --> 00:55:04.326]  So, let's talk about that.
[00:55:04.506 --> 00:55:05.827]  Talk about that, Sean Hannity.
[00:55:06.307 --> 00:55:07.488]  Talk about that, Bill O'Reilly.
[00:55:07.508 --> 00:55:08.588]  Talk about that, Rush.
[00:55:08.628 --> 00:55:09.869]  Talk about that, Meghan McCain.
[00:55:09.889 --> 00:55:10.729]  Just talk about it.
[00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:12.010]  Just talk about it.
[00:55:12.935 --> 00:55:14.016]  Let's just discuss it.
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.563]  I would love to hear their thoughts about that.
[00:55:20.184 --> 00:55:31.458]  Because, you know, unless they're going to spend the entire time criticizing me and the things they think I've done or have done, then, you know, let's talk about what's really going on.
[00:55:35.854 --> 00:55:39.816]  Charlie, there's no doubt that you are risking a lot doing this.
[00:55:39.856 --> 00:55:41.556]  There's no doubt we're risking our lives doing this.
[00:55:41.576 --> 00:55:42.277]  These are murderers.
[00:55:43.337 --> 00:55:45.318]  Some of these people that run these dark systems.
[00:55:45.958 --> 00:55:48.179]  Again, why did you do this?
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:51.581]  Let me illustrate one thing.
[00:55:51.601 --> 00:55:57.063]  There's been a little heat from the corporate side of my workplace.
[00:55:59.084 --> 00:56:03.205]  What I've explained to them is, hey, this is where I work, but I live in the real world.
[00:56:05.287 --> 00:56:11.071]  You know, I'm sorry I can't stand idly by any longer and just pretend like all this stuff is going to fix itself.
[00:56:11.111 --> 00:56:22.778]  But if I've got a platform that others don't, that others need, if I've got a voice that can be of service to those that need me, then I'm going to use it.
[00:56:22.939 --> 00:56:34.066]  You know, and I had an amazing example growing up of my father, who stood in the face of tyranny my entire life and was ridiculed and criticized and called insane and misguided and uninformed.
[00:56:34.716 --> 00:56:50.429]  A radical and a tinfoil hat wearer, and I had that as an example of a guy that just believed in the truth and believed in humanity, believed in goodwill, and believed in bringing hope to the hopeless.
[00:56:54.568 --> 00:56:55.908]  Charlie, we've got a break again.
[00:56:55.928 --> 00:57:00.570]  I want to come back and speak about that, go through more of the points, and we're going to go to Bob McIlvain as well.
[00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:06.091]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:57:06.232 --> 00:57:10.593]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:57:10.753 --> 00:57:12.613]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:57:13.034 --> 00:57:14.354]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:57:14.654 --> 00:57:15.714]  There is a solution.
[00:57:15.934 --> 00:57:23.957]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:58:03.342 --> 00:58:06.686]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:58:07.984 --> 00:58:10.446]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:11.046 --> 00:58:13.828]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:13.868 --> 00:58:16.090]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:19.112]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:58:19.853 --> 00:58:27.158]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:58:30.185 --> 00:58:35.168]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:58:35.629 --> 00:58:39.111]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:58:39.511 --> 00:58:42.013]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:58:42.073 --> 00:58:43.214]  Most people have no idea.
[00:58:43.234 --> 00:58:43.994]  They're not after money.
[00:58:44.014 --> 00:58:45.095]  They have all the money they need.
[00:58:45.295 --> 00:58:45.896]  They're after power.
[00:58:45.916 --> 00:58:47.136]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:58:58.964 --> 00:59:00.065]  You have been warned.
[00:59:00.925 --> 00:59:04.667]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:14.670]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[01:00:02.122 --> 01:00:04.343]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:04.883 --> 01:00:07.624]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.741]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:00:10.801 --> 01:00:12.361]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:13.342]  Central Standard Time.
[01:00:13.682 --> 01:00:14.402]  We're here live.
[01:00:14.422 --> 01:00:15.403]  We're not left or right.
[01:00:16.524 --> 01:00:18.104]  We are against corruption.
[01:00:18.184 --> 01:00:23.367]  We're against socialism, communism, imperialism, any form of command-and-control tyranny.
[01:00:24.147 --> 01:00:25.248]  And we just tell the truth.
[01:00:25.668 --> 01:00:28.129]  We have a declassified government document in ABC News.
[01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:30.050]  Operation Northwoods, U.S.
[01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:31.111]  government plan to bomb U.S.
[01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:32.311]  cities as pretext for war.
[01:00:32.932 --> 01:00:35.253]  We have Army field manuals where the government stages terror.
[01:00:35.693 --> 01:00:36.493]  It's declassified.
[01:00:36.534 --> 01:00:37.254]  We talk about it.
[01:00:39.047 --> 01:00:42.209]  We know that the Gardasil shots are killing people, and it's in the news.
[01:00:42.249 --> 01:00:42.769]  We cover it.
[01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:45.470]  I mean, that's all we do here is tell the truth.
[01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:46.890]  Our only agenda is the truth.
[01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:54.374]  Charlie, we're trying to explain your role models, your father, everything your father has done.
[01:00:54.394 --> 01:00:59.856]  I mean, he spoke out day one with you against the war, and you guys really got attacked for that.
[01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:01.216]  Look who was proven right in the end.
[01:01:01.456 --> 01:01:03.557]  How dare your dad say there weren't WMDs.
[01:01:03.977 --> 01:01:05.158]  We're on the right side of history.
[01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.162]  Yeah, I think that's really key, Alex.
[01:01:08.182 --> 01:01:09.684]  I think that's really key.
[01:01:09.924 --> 01:01:13.807]  I absolutely believe that myself, that we are on the right side of history.
[01:01:14.027 --> 01:01:20.152]  And I think it's only a matter of time before more join us on that right side.
[01:01:20.612 --> 01:01:26.457]  I think what people need to understand and what has been such a really
[01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:33.531]  Offensive spin job is that I'm not claiming that I know what happened.
[01:01:33.671 --> 01:01:35.071]  I'm not making those claims.
[01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:38.713]  I'm just asking people to look at the inconsistencies.
[01:01:39.653 --> 01:01:40.594]  Look at the stuff.
[01:01:40.634 --> 01:01:44.535]  Look at the absolute facts that were completely ignored.
[01:01:45.175 --> 01:01:57.260]  You know, when you get into the doomsday plane, which Anderson Cooper reported on, and then the commission deemed it... They had so much to investigate, they didn't feel it was important enough to include in the report.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.061]  Guys, it's the doomsday plane.
[01:02:00.001 --> 01:02:12.866]  Over New York, over D.C., multiple government E-4Bs, over command and control aircraft, while this is happening, but jets 20-something miles away, F-16s can't get there, but the doomsday planes are over both targets.
[01:02:13.587 --> 01:02:14.467]  It's a real problem.
[01:02:14.507 --> 01:02:15.547]  It needs to be looked at.
[01:02:15.567 --> 01:02:18.128]  It needs to be looked at thoroughly.
[01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:25.011]  Let's subpoena and put those pilots under oath.
[01:02:25.832 --> 01:02:26.492]  Let's do that.
[01:02:27.321 --> 01:02:28.242]  When did you take off?
[01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:29.383]  How long were you in the air?
[01:02:29.703 --> 01:02:30.464]  What was your mission?
[01:02:30.524 --> 01:02:31.284]  What were you doing there?
[01:02:31.324 --> 01:02:32.085]  What were you told?
[01:02:34.627 --> 01:02:36.188]  And again, Alex, it's not just me.
[01:02:36.248 --> 01:02:40.611]  I mean, these are the questions that the families had at the Commission hearings.
[01:02:41.312 --> 01:02:44.895]  This is all the stuff that was completely swept aside.
[01:02:44.915 --> 01:02:55.503]  It was absolutely stonewalled at every turn, and frustrated, and screaming out during the proceedings, being escorted away as a security violation.
[01:02:55.543 --> 01:02:56.484]  I mean, come on!
[01:02:57.472 --> 01:02:57.932]  Come on.
[01:02:58.152 --> 01:03:02.073]  Yeah, they're in there screaming, saying, cover up, inside job.
[01:03:02.393 --> 01:03:03.453]  They're drug away.
[01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.954]  People like Bob McElveen, whose son died.
[01:03:06.434 --> 01:03:10.955]  And then meanwhile, these media whores get up there and say, all the families disagree with Charlie Sheen.
[01:03:11.495 --> 01:03:16.776]  When, here's an example out of Salon, 911 truth signatory standby call for new investigation.
[01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:21.517]  And Salon called 50 of these people and only got two of them to halfway recant.
[01:03:21.937 --> 01:03:25.478]  And Salon rightfully said, wrote a positive piece and said, look, people have a right
[01:03:27.501 --> 01:03:30.188]  Of course they do.
[01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.817]  I mean, that's the country I was raised in.
[01:03:34.599 --> 01:03:35.762]  That's what I was told to believe in.
[01:03:38.922 --> 01:03:42.763]  Charlie, let's go over some of these other points, but before we do that, I want to go back to Cybele Edmonds.
[01:03:43.184 --> 01:03:45.985]  She's the FBI translator listening to NSA Intercepts.
[01:03:46.585 --> 01:03:49.066]  She goes public on this show and other shows about four years ago.
[01:03:49.146 --> 01:03:50.046]  Federal gag order.
[01:03:50.466 --> 01:03:51.467]  She's trying to get around it.
[01:03:51.947 --> 01:03:58.029]  She's saying drug running, terrorist funding, human trafficking, murder, hit teams.
[01:03:58.069 --> 01:04:06.032]  That's now all come out that Cheney was running hit teams in mainstream news illegally, even in the U.S., against non-Al Qaeda, Al-Qaeda targets.
[01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:13.656]  And she comes out now, breaks the federal gag order about a month ago, it was the middle of August, and goes public.
[01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:21.918]  We've got clips in the video, your message to the President, saying, up until the day of 9-11, Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda and Taliban were working for the CIA.
[01:04:22.318 --> 01:04:26.379]  Yeah, and it didn't get any mainstream coverage whatsoever.
[01:04:27.279 --> 01:04:31.240]  Why is that not the top story on the 6 o'clock evening news?
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.281]  Why is the FBI revealing that Ted Olsen
[01:04:35.768 --> 01:04:39.972]  The Secretary General never got the phone call from his wife.
[01:04:40.372 --> 01:04:43.055]  Why is that not the lead story on the 6 o'clock evening news?
[01:04:44.096 --> 01:04:45.437]  What about the cell phones?
[01:04:45.697 --> 01:04:47.920]  They still can't make them work above 10,000 feet.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:53.325]  Every time I'm on a flight, I try, as I take off with it, to see when it cuts out.
[01:04:53.345 --> 01:04:55.146]  It does it at about 3,000 feet every time.
[01:04:55.547 --> 01:04:57.028]  I know how tall these radio towers are.
[01:04:57.068 --> 01:04:57.208]  They're 2,000.
[01:04:57.368 --> 01:04:59.550]  When I get about 1,000 above, it cuts out.
[01:05:00.411 --> 01:05:02.512]  If I'm lucky, flying into L.A.
[01:05:02.552 --> 01:05:04.513]  and places, I'll have it on at 20,000, 10,000.
[01:05:05.253 --> 01:05:07.474]  The sucker doesn't turn on until 1,000 feet or so.
[01:05:07.494 --> 01:05:07.894]  Sure.
[01:05:08.274 --> 01:05:10.015]  Then they admit she didn't use their phones.
[01:05:10.275 --> 01:05:16.278]  Then the FBI says, yeah, we have no record of her ever making her call getting through to him, to Ted Olson.
[01:05:16.838 --> 01:05:17.758]  Give us your take on that.
[01:05:17.798 --> 01:05:21.460]  These magical cell phones that on a bunch of flights were working that day.
[01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:43.352]  Well, again, Alex, I think that these are areas that, you know, we can only ask that some scientific research be presented behind, and that, you know, for us to sit here and try to figure all that out, I mean, at face value, it sounds absurd, but let's investigate it.
[01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:44.813]  Let's look at it further.
[01:05:45.013 --> 01:05:46.815]  Let's turn it over to some experts.
[01:05:47.795 --> 01:05:48.856]  Let's see what they have to say.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.581]  Forget my opinion of it, forget your opinion of it.
[01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:56.662]  I mean, yeah, it's pretty obvious, but still, let's put it in the hands of the people that do that stuff for a living.
[01:05:57.303 --> 01:05:58.943]  Guys a thousand times smarter than me.
[01:05:58.963 --> 01:06:01.804]  Stuff they do all day, every day.
[01:06:01.844 --> 01:06:13.028]  Let's give it to them, along with all these other points, all these other facts, and, you know, omissions, as they were, and as they are.
[01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:30.404]  Charlie, I have Bob McIlvain on the line with us, and we're going to have him on for about five minutes or so, then we're going to go back through some of the final points of the time we have left with you today, but there's a famous quote by Bob McIlvain about his son.
[01:06:30.784 --> 01:06:33.867]  He says, it upsets me tremendously that Bobby, my son who died,
[01:06:34.728 --> 01:06:40.572]  Could be used as a political pawn to be manipulated at times like this and abused.
[01:06:41.193 --> 01:06:51.701]  And he went on from there, but instead of just reading quotes from Bob who lost his son Bobby on 9-11, I want to go ahead and go to him now.
[01:06:52.401 --> 01:06:55.604]  Bob McIlvain, who was in the 9-11 Commission, who tried to speak to him.
[01:06:56.424 --> 01:06:59.987]  Sir, what do you think on this 8th anniversary about what Charlie and all of us are doing?
[01:07:01.394 --> 01:07:12.896]  Well, if anyone does anything, I just so greatly appreciate it because, you know, it's very difficult to, you know, no one can sit there and coordinate what's happening.
[01:07:12.936 --> 01:07:18.877]  And as Charlie just said, you know, you hear these things, but, you know, they have to be investigated.
[01:07:19.197 --> 01:07:26.679]  Well, that's what I've spent my life doing because, you know, after going to the 9-11 Commission hearing, I came out so disgusted, absolutely disgusted, that
[01:07:27.526 --> 01:07:31.109]  You know, and Denise had even said that this is not an investigation.
[01:07:31.509 --> 01:07:32.810]  It's merely an exposition.
[01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:36.653]  And again, I always tell people, people get that as a parent.
[01:07:37.574 --> 01:07:40.396]  And as a parent, my son was murdered.
[01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:45.840]  And here, the 9-11 Commission, who were supposed to be investigating the murder of my son.
[01:07:46.141 --> 01:07:47.422]  And I try to keep it to myself.
[01:07:47.462 --> 01:07:53.947]  I'm not a spokesperson for anyone else in the 9-11 movement, because that's my job as a parent, as a father.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.181]  To find out how my son was murdered.
[01:07:56.221 --> 01:08:01.504]  And I actually thought maybe, during the line of inquiry, maybe they're going to really find out if it's true.
[01:08:01.524 --> 01:08:04.906]  Well, I came out of that saying, well, nothing they told me is true.
[01:08:05.966 --> 01:08:09.928]  So, I'll tell people, you know, they say, oh, you're getting involved in these conspiracy theories.
[01:08:09.968 --> 01:08:13.030]  There's nothing to do with conspiracy theories.
[01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.491]  That's all I'm doing.
[01:08:14.531 --> 01:08:15.951]  Please tell me what happened.
[01:08:16.552 --> 01:08:22.795]  I mean, God, when you hear the FBI says that we can't prove that Obama's son was part of it.
[01:08:23.674 --> 01:08:27.280]  Uh, you know, when I pick up the flight manifest, I don't see any Arabs on it.
[01:08:27.884 --> 01:08:31.767]  Well, I don't know for sure who was on the plane, but I certainly think, geez, what happened here?
[01:08:31.887 --> 01:08:32.347]  You know what I mean?
[01:08:58.504 --> 01:09:11.747]  Well, you know, with that, I would still say to someone that they found the passport there.
[01:09:11.827 --> 01:09:13.847]  It's mind-boggling to me.
[01:09:14.187 --> 01:09:15.647]  I mean, immediately I heard that.
[01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:17.028]  I said, this doesn't sound right.
[01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:20.228]  But I wouldn't base anything on that.
[01:09:20.888 --> 01:09:23.549]  You know, the more I investigate, of course, we don't have the time.
[01:09:24.762 --> 01:09:28.884]  I think I could sit here for six months and we could talk about 9-11.
[01:09:29.264 --> 01:09:33.486]  We'll do another show with you and maybe Charlie can come back in a few weeks.
[01:09:34.386 --> 01:09:47.152]  When you're on a landline, I know you were down there at the memorial today, you're traveling back in a car right now on cell phone, but Charlie, I know you and Bob have talked privately, I got you guys together, would you like to say anything to Bob McIlvain?
[01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:53.031]  Bob, I just want to say that I'm just so deeply sorry for your loss.
[01:09:53.531 --> 01:10:01.094]  I'm a father of five, and I can't even imagine what you've been through for almost a decade now.
[01:10:01.354 --> 01:10:12.978]  And I hope that my efforts and the efforts of people like Alex and all of those that are joining our cause are already a part of it.
[01:10:14.019 --> 01:10:16.780]  I hope that we can not only deliver some hope
[01:10:17.506 --> 01:10:18.907]  But we can also deliver some answers.
[01:10:21.449 --> 01:10:21.769]  Bob?
[01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:23.010]  Thanks, Charlie.
[01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:24.010]  I appreciate that.
[01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:25.611]  It's the least I can do, Bob.
[01:10:25.852 --> 01:10:26.592]  It's my duty.
[01:10:27.753 --> 01:10:29.514]  Bob, does it anger you?
[01:10:29.534 --> 01:10:31.115]  I mean, I've talked to you on the phone, it does.
[01:10:31.555 --> 01:10:39.100]  To watch Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly saying none of the families think it's an inside job, that they're angry at Charlie.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.861]  But they never bring these people on the show.
[01:10:41.122 --> 01:10:42.763]  They're just, they're lying, saying this.
[01:10:44.858 --> 01:10:46.200]  Is that to me, Alex?
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:46.841]  Yes.
[01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:48.443]  Does that make you mad?
[01:10:48.503 --> 01:10:50.265]  I try not to get angry.
[01:10:50.285 --> 01:10:51.546]  I really have to work on my anger.
[01:10:52.107 --> 01:10:53.309]  And I really watch the show.
[01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:57.133]  I look at them as energy containers.
[01:10:57.894 --> 01:10:59.516]  And to me, it's a bit reclinish.
[01:10:59.817 --> 01:11:03.842]  I mean, if you look at Glenn Beck, I mean, they're there to make money as far as I'm concerned.
[01:11:05.244 --> 01:11:06.785]  And they do that to get people angry.
[01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:11.128]  And that's why, you know, sometimes you really have to protect yourself and try to stay away from people.
[01:11:11.148 --> 01:11:13.590]  Specifically, they are misrepresenting the families.
[01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:19.535]  I've interviewed all the heads of the biggest groups and they all say they have... There's no question about that.
[01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:25.479]  But you know, they have that kind of power because if people hear it from them, they don't believe it.
[01:11:25.499 --> 01:11:30.103]  Just to be clear on record, just to be clear on record, you and many other family members and victims
[01:11:31.964 --> 01:11:39.012]  Of course I am.
[01:11:39.112 --> 01:11:43.177]  You know, I do get angry, but that's why I won't watch the show.
[01:11:43.597 --> 01:11:44.658]  Because it gets me angry.
[01:11:44.678 --> 01:11:46.520]  You know, you have to stay cool.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.641]  You have to stay calm.
[01:11:48.583 --> 01:11:50.685]  Because you can't get the word out if you don't.
[01:11:51.386 --> 01:11:53.809]  And, uh, you know, I'll tell people that, okay?
[01:11:53.829 --> 01:11:57.774]  I know a thousand people, not, you know, personally, but just from the website.
[01:11:58.635 --> 01:12:02.259]  And sometimes it gets me angry that more 9-11 family members aren't doing more.
[01:12:02.279 --> 01:12:11.910]  You know, I've told people, I say, you know, if we got 200 family members who went down there and did civil disobedience down at the Pentagon or down at the FBI building, I'll tell you what, we would get something done.
[01:12:12.853 --> 01:12:18.056]  But, you know, it's just such an emotional thing to get involved in, and that's where the problem is.
[01:12:18.076 --> 01:12:26.840]  They'll hear from family members that they feel that this is horrible, what we're doing, but they just don't hear from the other family members because it's so difficult to do this.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:27.100]  Sure.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:35.944]  Bob, in closing, Bob, in closing, specifically, what do you, from your research, believe happened on 9-11?
[01:12:36.804 --> 01:12:40.406]  I think it had 19 patsies that came in that were trained in the United States.
[01:12:40.446 --> 01:12:42.067]  Kayleigh Chegg behind me with a patsy.
[01:12:42.822 --> 01:12:48.744]  And War Ride, it was a combination of staying down, and because of the war games, it was really easy.
[01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:50.885]  You know, people said, well, there had to be thousands of people.
[01:12:51.465 --> 01:12:55.646]  But if you understand the war games, the planes should have been intercepted.
[01:12:55.846 --> 01:13:01.188]  And what happened in the months before, and what happened on that day, is just unbelievable.
[01:13:01.548 --> 01:13:02.629]  And that's where the story is.
[01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:06.910]  It seems a lot of 9-11 troopers, I don't know if they ignore it, but they don't talk about it.
[01:13:07.304 --> 01:13:08.845]  Those planes should have been intercepted.
[01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:10.306]  That's standard procedure.
[01:13:10.826 --> 01:13:16.149]  And real quickly, General Meyers said, well, we're trained to look out to the outside.
[01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:26.856]  But one of the missions of NORAD, and it's been since 1958 when NORAD started, that air sovereignty is the most
[01:13:27.318 --> 01:13:30.341]  Bob, in closing here, we're going to have some final comments from Charlie Sheen.
[01:13:43.078 --> 01:13:57.541]  Charlie has talked to you, I've talked to you, you want to go on Larry King Live, you're ready to debate whoever they put up against you, and you do, even in your own words, you would be, you want to go with Charlie and other 9-11 victims and meet with President Obama?
[01:13:58.341 --> 01:13:59.081]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:14:00.021 --> 01:14:01.762]  Just tell me, just tell me where and when.
[01:14:02.682 --> 01:14:06.743]  But, but, but Bob, you're, you're ready, you want to go and meet with President Obama?
[01:14:07.783 --> 01:14:09.163]  I would, I would meet with anybody.
[01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:11.426]  I'll meet with the man on the moon.
[01:14:11.746 --> 01:14:13.887]  That's what it took to get the truth out.
[01:14:15.988 --> 01:14:17.409]  I'd be willing to meet with anyone.
[01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.150]  To get the truth out.
[01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.571]  Especially the president.
[01:14:21.772 --> 01:14:22.372]  Alright, Bob.
[01:14:22.552 --> 01:14:23.833]  Let's start at the top, Bob.
[01:14:24.313 --> 01:14:25.174]  Let's start at the top.
[01:14:25.674 --> 01:14:26.414]  Work our way down.
[01:14:27.975 --> 01:14:29.536]  Alright, Bob McIlvain, God bless you.
[01:14:29.556 --> 01:14:32.398]  Sorry about your son's loss, but he lives on through your grandson you're raising.
[01:14:33.078 --> 01:14:34.919]  God bless you, sir, on this 8th anniversary.
[01:14:34.939 --> 01:14:35.320]  Take care.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.241]  Alright, hey, thank you, Alex.
[01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:38.401]  You bet, Bob.
[01:14:40.322 --> 01:14:40.762]  There he goes.
[01:14:40.882 --> 01:14:43.964]  Okay, in the six, seven minutes we have left with Charlie Sheen.
[01:14:44.505 --> 01:14:50.829]  Charlie, your letter, your statements, your video message to the President, a call to arms.
[01:14:51.409 --> 01:14:52.169]  You're the General.
[01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:54.191]  Millions are listening.
[01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:56.792]  Tens of millions will view this later and listen to it later.
[01:14:57.353 --> 01:14:59.034]  The call to arms, the call to action.
[01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:01.015]  What do you want to see in 9-11 Truth, my friend?
[01:15:01.775 --> 01:15:03.396]  I want people to start standing up.
[01:15:04.057 --> 01:15:05.678]  I want people, first of all, to wake up.
[01:15:06.138 --> 01:15:07.419]  Those that haven't already.
[01:15:08.339 --> 01:15:09.280]  And then, and then,
[01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:11.322]  Sorry to interrupt.
[01:15:12.262 --> 01:15:15.445]  And then just know that they have a voice.
[01:15:15.465 --> 01:15:21.309]  And that through, in mass, in numbers, they have a bigger voice.
[01:15:21.329 --> 01:15:24.971]  And reach out to your local politicians.
[01:15:25.132 --> 01:15:26.212]  Get organized.
[01:15:26.332 --> 01:15:27.513]  Get petitions going.
[01:15:28.114 --> 01:15:29.315]  Make the voice louder.
[01:15:29.835 --> 01:15:32.397]  Bring this thing to a point where they cannot ignore it.
[01:15:32.457 --> 01:15:33.838]  Where it isn't just, you know,
[01:15:34.471 --> 01:15:37.435]  Black Job actor from Hollywood talking about fantasy theories.
[01:15:37.535 --> 01:15:38.856]  Get involved, people.
[01:15:38.916 --> 01:15:39.497]  Get out there.
[01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:40.358]  Do something.
[01:15:40.939 --> 01:15:46.666]  It's one thing to say, and I really appreciate all the comments and all the support, but take that energy and put it into action.
[01:15:47.527 --> 01:15:49.849]  Put it into action and demand the truth.
[01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:53.454]  Get on the right side of history with us.
[01:15:55.814 --> 01:15:56.574]  Beautifully said.
[01:15:56.594 --> 01:16:03.375]  9-11 was meant by the scientific dictatorship, the controllers, in their own documents.
[01:16:03.495 --> 01:16:06.196]  They talk about how they would stage massive terror attacks to get total power.
[01:16:06.536 --> 01:16:10.457]  It was meant to be the event to set up a planetary police state.
[01:16:10.977 --> 01:16:24.239]  I believe 9-11 is going to end up, and also these premeditated offensive crimes against humanity, these offensive preemptive wars, I believe it's going to be their waterloo, Charlie.
[01:16:25.854 --> 01:16:27.154]  I hope you're right, Alex.
[01:16:27.494 --> 01:16:28.175]  I hope you're right.
[01:16:28.855 --> 01:16:35.757]  I mean, you know, this stuff happens in broad daylight.
[01:16:38.497 --> 01:16:39.738]  You know, that's the arrogance.
[01:16:40.278 --> 01:16:44.799]  That's the pathology that we're dealing with here.
[01:16:46.759 --> 01:16:51.881]  We just need to keep asking the hard questions, keep insisting that people don't
[01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:55.749]  Allow ourselves to be dismissed.
[01:16:57.151 --> 01:16:58.612]  Just pushed over there.
[01:16:58.632 --> 01:17:05.978]  And I think it's, you know, it's like what Aaron Russo said so wonderfully in his final interview in that wonderful documentary that you put together with him.
[01:17:06.538 --> 01:17:09.160]  He said, don't be afraid to be called stupid.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.902]  Don't be afraid to be called crazy.
[01:17:10.942 --> 01:17:12.463]  Don't be afraid to have a voice.
[01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:15.666]  Don't be afraid to stand up and say, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, people.
[01:17:15.686 --> 01:17:16.786]  This doesn't make any sense.
[01:17:17.847 --> 01:17:20.710]  And I'm insisting that somebody, somebody look at this.
[01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:23.592]  Somebody that has the power to make a change.
[01:17:28.714 --> 01:17:31.476]  Well, Charlie Sheen, your courage is an example to all of us.
[01:17:31.536 --> 01:17:38.302]  A man who is the highest paid TV actor out there, five children, a great life, and takes a lot of risk.
[01:17:38.342 --> 01:17:41.944]  And I know this has been good for your soul, as you've said many times to me.
[01:17:42.005 --> 01:17:45.127]  Food for the soul, but at the same time very stressful.
[01:17:46.508 --> 01:17:49.711]  And if we all lead by your example,
[01:17:50.984 --> 01:17:54.866]  We're going to be in a better world, because great tyranny is upon us, and people better get involved.
[01:17:54.886 --> 01:17:58.369]  We're being lied to about the banking takeover, the $23.7 trillion.
[01:17:59.169 --> 01:18:05.913]  I know you'd also said that the Obama deception, you'd supported Obama, really also helped crystallize that why isn't he calling for an investigation.
[01:18:06.194 --> 01:18:07.775]  What was your take on the Obama deception?
[01:18:07.795 --> 01:18:09.596]  I thought it was a masterpiece, Alex.
[01:18:09.696 --> 01:18:15.920]  Really, I think it should be mandatory viewing for anybody in this country, especially those who voted for him, like myself.
[01:18:16.713 --> 01:18:22.397]  And, you know, anybody else on the planet that wants the truth about what's really going on.
[01:18:23.057 --> 01:18:28.380]  And I would urge people to get it, make copies, hand it out, promote it.
[01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:31.462]  Just, you know, organize groups to watch it.
[01:18:31.922 --> 01:18:32.763]  Hold screenings.
[01:18:33.243 --> 01:18:39.507]  I think it is, along with Endgame, it is one of the most important documentaries ever produced.
[01:18:41.188 --> 01:18:46.191]  And I tip my hat to you for having the courage to deliver such an important
[01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.031]  Uh, historical piece.
[01:18:49.811 --> 01:18:52.131]  I'm just freaking, uh, just proud to know you, man.
[01:18:52.571 --> 01:18:54.632]  Hey, I'm proud to call you my friend.
[01:18:55.372 --> 01:18:56.773]  Hey, I'm proud to call you my friend.
[01:18:56.793 --> 01:18:59.593]  You know, we didn't go over all the 20 points that are in your letter.
[01:18:59.613 --> 01:19:00.073]  You know what?
[01:19:00.114 --> 01:19:02.414]  They speak for themselves.
[01:19:03.014 --> 01:19:06.215]  You know, and the mainstream media ain't going over the 20 points either.
[01:19:06.235 --> 01:19:07.315]  And what does that say?
[01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:08.876]  What does that say, Alex?
[01:19:08.916 --> 01:19:10.496]  They won't even talk about them.
[01:19:11.837 --> 01:19:12.857]  I'm so crazy.
[01:19:13.411 --> 01:19:16.732]  If I align myself with so many nutbags and, you know, how dare I?
[01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:21.613]  I'm so unpatriotic and I'm such a, you know, a complete nutjob.
[01:19:22.073 --> 01:19:24.133]  Why won't they address what I wrote?
[01:19:24.213 --> 01:19:26.074]  Why won't they address what we assembled?
[01:19:26.574 --> 01:19:29.294]  Why won't they even look at it or even talk about it?
[01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:31.175]  That speaks volumes.
[01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:33.015]  That shows their hand.
[01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:36.896]  I agree, but I don't want to end this interview in the few minutes we've got left.
[01:19:38.584 --> 01:19:41.005]  Without you getting into Building 7.
[01:19:41.266 --> 01:19:44.287]  And you say in the piece, just watch the video of the collapse.
[01:19:44.307 --> 01:19:44.627]  Yeah.
[01:19:44.647 --> 01:19:49.050]  And we have a link to the police and firemen saying, we've been told to get back, they're going to blow it up.
[01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:52.312]  BBC reports it's fallen completely in its own footprint.
[01:19:52.592 --> 01:19:55.734]  Before it falls, then they said, oh, that video is not real.
[01:19:55.774 --> 01:19:56.634]  Then they admitted it was real.
[01:19:56.654 --> 01:19:58.535]  Then they said, oh, we lost the tapes.
[01:19:58.595 --> 01:20:01.537]  Then they said, OK, Reuters told us it had fallen.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.901]  Yeah, they didn't really have their story straight.
[01:20:06.441 --> 01:20:08.942]  Or they got the story and then they just rolled it out early.
[01:20:09.522 --> 01:20:14.924]  I don't know, but the reason that that is the one point, and it's obviously number seven, because it's building seven, that's pretty obvious.
[01:20:14.984 --> 01:20:26.149]  The reason that I only gave it one line is, if I'm not mistaken, wasn't it reduced to a footnote in the official report?
[01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.369]  Yes.
[01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:31.971]  Yeah, so that's, you know, they gave it that much attention and
[01:20:33.174 --> 01:20:39.757]  The attention that we give it in the piece, I think, is really powerful, because it's just like basically saying, Mr. President, just take a look for yourself.
[01:20:39.817 --> 01:20:41.177]  You're a really smart guy.
[01:20:41.777 --> 01:20:43.298]  You're a really educated man.
[01:20:43.358 --> 01:20:44.638]  Just take a look for yourself.
[01:20:45.019 --> 01:20:45.319]  You know what?
[01:20:45.339 --> 01:20:46.379]  Let's watch it together.
[01:20:46.879 --> 01:20:50.661]  And then you tell me, is that the result of, uh, you know, from fire?
[01:20:51.801 --> 01:20:54.202]  Charlie, I know you've got to go to work and take two and a half men.
[01:20:54.222 --> 01:20:55.283]  That's going to be airing Monday.
[01:20:55.303 --> 01:20:57.684]  So I'm going to just let you go in just two or three minutes.
[01:20:58.344 --> 01:21:01.165]  The season premiere on the 21st couldn't help but put in a plug, Alex.
[01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:02.771]  Hey, that's a great show.
[01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:03.932]  The guys are fans in here.
[01:21:04.152 --> 01:21:04.652]  Thank you.
[01:21:04.792 --> 01:21:05.933]  Especially Jeremy, he loves it.
[01:21:06.193 --> 01:21:09.175]  Also, hey, Alex, big shout out to your whole staff.
[01:21:09.796 --> 01:21:20.643]  Guys like Aaron, Kurt, Paul, the guys that just worked 22-hour days leading up to this thing, and they just really, really showed who they are and what they're made of and how much they care as well.
[01:21:20.663 --> 01:21:31.070]  These are the guys behind the scenes that don't get the type of attention you and I get, but everybody needs to know how important they were in this whole process and launching
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.780]  Yeah, I almost give it its code name.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.841]  It's tempting, Alec.
[01:21:34.901 --> 01:21:35.701]  We'll keep that between us.
[01:21:52.159 --> 01:21:59.842]  Are you disappointed that so far the White House called you and said, look, we've seen it, we might pass on it, which shows they're leaving the door open.
[01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:04.404]  I know you're calling people to go out, get involved, go to town halls, go to his press conferences.
[01:22:04.705 --> 01:22:10.187]  You're asking, I know you've asked me to ask folks to tell people to go to the press conferences of the president, go to demonstrations.
[01:22:10.207 --> 01:22:11.167]  Let's make this a big issue.
[01:22:11.187 --> 01:22:12.488]  Let's beat the drum.
[01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:19.111]  Speak to that in closing and directly to Obama, because there's no doubt that the White House is watching and seeing this.
[01:22:20.259 --> 01:22:20.719]  Let's hope.
[01:22:21.099 --> 01:22:21.479]  Let's hope.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:26.421]  I mean, I know, like I said, they got their hands full with a lot of other stuff, but they need to know that this really matters.
[01:22:28.142 --> 01:22:30.923]  This is, you know, it's all laid out in the letter.
[01:22:31.563 --> 01:22:42.187]  You know, how much this has shaped the current policy and, you know, why the landscape exists as it does today.
[01:22:44.708 --> 01:22:49.650]  You know, if they cannot meet with myself and
[01:22:50.492 --> 01:22:54.634]  Certain family members, they really need to write me a letter and explain why.
[01:22:54.834 --> 01:22:55.614]  I wrote them a letter.
[01:22:56.315 --> 01:22:58.376]  And they need to explain why.
[01:22:58.396 --> 01:23:07.200]  And they need to know that that letter will be made public because it's important that people know how they feel about this.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:13.723]  That people know, you know, if they got nothing to hide, then why are they avoiding it?
[01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:17.431]  And let's be clear, it's not just Charlie Sheen meeting with the President.
[01:23:17.471 --> 01:23:23.792]  You've said in the emails, I'd like to come with Bob McIlvain, Bill Doyle, others, and they want to meet with you.
[01:23:24.033 --> 01:23:25.313]  They're trying to meet with the Commission.
[01:23:26.133 --> 01:23:26.933]  Absolutely, yes.
[01:23:27.293 --> 01:23:30.754]  Yeah, no, they, uh, they deserve the time.
[01:23:31.194 --> 01:23:32.275]  They deserve the attention.
[01:23:32.755 --> 01:23:43.998]  They deserve that, uh, that, that, that, you know, that our Commander-in-Chief would, uh, would take a look at this and would hopefully say, yeah, okay, alright, this is, uh,
[01:23:44.895 --> 01:23:45.595]  This is important.
[01:23:45.615 --> 01:23:46.095]  This matters.
[01:23:46.155 --> 01:23:56.197]  And yes, I do have the power and I do have the responsibility as your president to use my executive power to enact a real investigation and to put this thing back on the front burner.
[01:23:56.237 --> 01:23:57.857]  Put it on the front burner, Mr. President.
[01:23:58.417 --> 01:23:58.997]  Enough's enough.
[01:23:59.878 --> 01:24:10.919]  So, bottom line, you're saying at least publicly respond to the 20 questions or just respond to six of the 10 commission members and two of the five council members saying it was a fraud, a criminal cover-up?
[01:24:11.099 --> 01:24:11.440]  Anything.
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.500]  Alex, just acknowledge it.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.260]  Just be courageous enough
[01:24:14.736 --> 01:24:17.617]  And compassionate enough to acknowledge it.
[01:24:18.438 --> 01:24:19.218]  That's all I'm asking.
[01:24:19.999 --> 01:24:21.399]  And if we can take it further, great!
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.180]  But just acknowledge it.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.182]  Stop treating us like we don't matter.
[01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:34.310]  Twenty-first of this month premieres UNF Men.
[01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:35.832]  We're going to let him get to work.
[01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:38.274]  How are the fires out in Los Angeles?
[01:24:38.294 --> 01:24:39.015]  Getting under control?
[01:24:39.035 --> 01:24:39.936]  Yeah, no.
[01:24:39.956 --> 01:24:47.363]  The fire teams out here did an amazing job getting this stuff put out as quickly as possible.
[01:24:47.463 --> 01:24:54.671]  Unfortunately, there were some lives lost and it's hard to go out to their families as well.
[01:24:56.809 --> 01:24:59.711]  The skies are clear and everything's back to normal.
[01:25:00.251 --> 01:25:06.376]  Yeah, it was like a week and a half ago when I was there, it was like flying into hell and you had ashes raining down on your backyard.
[01:25:07.276 --> 01:25:09.958]  Yeah, it was interesting.
[01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:17.643]  It created sort of a symbolic climate for creating this piece as we went through it.
[01:25:18.962 --> 01:25:19.822]  Charlie, I love you.
[01:25:19.842 --> 01:25:20.963]  I love you, too, man.
[01:25:21.703 --> 01:25:22.723]  And I love your passion.
[01:25:23.304 --> 01:25:24.484]  And I love everything you're doing.
[01:25:24.584 --> 01:25:27.945]  And it was great seeing your dad and mom when they came over.
[01:25:28.146 --> 01:25:29.266]  And say hi to Al.
[01:25:29.286 --> 01:25:29.986]  Say hi to Lance.
[01:25:31.007 --> 01:25:31.907]  Say hi to the whole crew.
[01:25:32.047 --> 01:25:33.348]  And God bless you, my friend.
[01:25:33.488 --> 01:25:34.328]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:25:36.104 --> 01:25:36.725]  All right, Charlie.
[01:25:36.745 --> 01:25:39.307]  I'm going to go ahead, I'm going to say bye to you here off air.
[01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:45.692]  We're going to air one more time the six and a half minute piece, his address, his reaching out, Charlie Sheen to the President.
[01:25:45.972 --> 01:25:57.982]  As I say bye to Charlie here, we're going to come back in six minutes and take your phone calls and recap this historic, amazing interview, this redeclaration of 9-11 truth, declaring war on the lie, the fraud that is the fable that is the official story of 9-11.
[01:25:58.042 --> 01:25:58.342]  Here it is.
[01:25:59.603 --> 01:26:01.645]  No warning signs, and I'm aware of the city threat.
[01:26:01.705 --> 01:26:04.948]  It was a revelation that the White House had no intention of making public.
[01:26:04.968 --> 01:26:11.214]  President Bush was told in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning an attack involving a hijacker.
[01:26:11.254 --> 01:26:13.877]  Nobody in our government at least.
[01:26:14.017 --> 01:26:19.082]  I believe the title was Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States.
[01:26:21.055 --> 01:26:25.039]  70% of family members' questions were never answered during the 9-11 Commission Report.
[01:26:25.199 --> 01:26:27.881]  Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean said they were set up to fail.
[01:26:27.901 --> 01:26:29.082]  I mean, I'm a member of the Commission.
[01:26:29.282 --> 01:26:29.943]  It's a scam.
[01:26:30.043 --> 01:26:31.484]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[01:26:32.225 --> 01:26:33.866]  The questions, Mr. President.
[01:26:34.807 --> 01:26:35.387]  The questions.
[01:26:37.849 --> 01:26:42.173]  Building 7 ablaze at the moment and apparently getting ready to collapse.
[01:26:42.873 --> 01:26:43.214]  Building 7.
[01:26:45.471 --> 01:26:47.032]  Well, no, there's number seven coming down.
[01:26:47.712 --> 01:26:55.675]  The excitement and the fun that people get watching an old building being demolished, and they wired very carefully for days, and it's a very careful operation.
[01:26:55.695 --> 01:27:06.318]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:27:06.338 --> 01:27:08.178]  It's one of those things, too, is pulling.
[01:27:09.679 --> 01:27:13.060]  They made that decision to pull, that we watch the building.
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:13.741]  Collapse.
[01:27:14.261 --> 01:27:18.024]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[01:27:18.244 --> 01:27:20.346]  Well, only really what you already know.
[01:27:20.366 --> 01:27:22.028]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[01:27:22.068 --> 01:27:31.355]  You're getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7 in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:35.939]  The Pentagon.
[01:27:36.059 --> 01:27:36.800]  Vanishing Airplane.
[01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:42.980]  My close-up inspection, there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon.
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:52.924]  The only sight is the actual side of the building that's crashed in, and as I said, the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you could pick up in your hand.
[01:27:53.445 --> 01:28:03.489]  There are no large tail sections, wing sections, a fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around, which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon.
[01:28:05.009 --> 01:28:06.150]  Firefighters and police
[01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:08.391]  He's describing explosions.
[01:28:09.492 --> 01:28:10.012]  A lot of them.
[01:28:10.533 --> 01:28:11.753]  This is a secondary explosion.
[01:28:11.773 --> 01:28:14.736]  We've got numerous people covered with dust from the secondary explosion.
[01:28:14.936 --> 01:28:16.997]  Floor by floor, it started popping out.
[01:28:17.078 --> 01:28:19.359]  It was like, it was as if they had detonated.
[01:28:19.459 --> 01:28:21.401]  As if there were plans to take down a building.
[01:28:21.501 --> 01:28:22.742]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:28:22.762 --> 01:28:24.383]  Looks sort of like the building just demolished.
[01:28:25.044 --> 01:28:27.425]  Even if there was no secondary explosives in the building.
[01:28:27.505 --> 01:28:28.766]  It sounded like gunfire.
[01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:30.468]  You know, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[01:28:30.528 --> 01:28:32.910]  And then all of a sudden, three big explosions.
[01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:35.672]  Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse?
[01:28:36.872 --> 01:28:40.754]  To me it sounded like an explosion.
[01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:54.702]  Chief Albert Turrey told me that he tried to get his men out as quickly as he could, but he said that there was another explosion which took place, and then an hour after there was another explosion in one of the towers here.
[01:28:58.384 --> 01:29:02.366]  Sabel Edmonds, FBI translator, breaking her gag order.
[01:29:03.130 --> 01:29:06.951]  All our intimate relationship with Bin Laden and Taliban.
[01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:13.533]  We did carry very intimate relationship with these people all the way up to September 11th.
[01:29:13.833 --> 01:29:19.394]  Bin Laden was spirited into this military hospital in Rawapendi for kidney dialysis treatment.
[01:29:19.514 --> 01:29:20.955]  The military had him surrounded.
[01:29:20.995 --> 01:29:25.216]  They were saying that Osama Bin Laden had to be watched carefully and looked after.
[01:29:27.236 --> 01:29:28.737]  NORAD standing down.
[01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:30.457]  Where were the planes?
[01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:37.160]  On now to one of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9-11.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:40.420]  A mysterious plane was seen flying right over the president's residence.
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.541]  The E-4Bs over New York and Washington.
[01:29:43.341 --> 01:29:45.481]  Otherwise known as the Doomsday Planes.
[01:29:45.501 --> 01:29:47.162]  It has never been officially explained.
[01:29:48.062 --> 01:29:50.682]  Cell phones working at impossible altitudes.
[01:29:53.003 --> 01:29:58.704]  Solicitor General Ted Olson receiving phone calls that the FBI says were never made.
[01:29:58.904 --> 01:30:00.044]  What happened during that call?
[01:30:00.064 --> 01:30:03.045]  This is the only information we have on these terrorists.
[01:30:05.169 --> 01:30:07.210]  She was able to call him twice.
[01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:10.051]  How she could pull that off, we don't know, but she did.
[01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.872]  These are the questions, Mr. President.
[01:30:13.873 --> 01:30:14.633]  These are the questions.
[01:30:15.434 --> 01:30:17.074]  They go on and on.
[01:30:20.996 --> 01:30:22.737]  Good afternoon, Mr. President.
[01:30:23.617 --> 01:30:30.740]  I come to you today representing the families of the victims of September 11th, as well as millions of my fellow Americans.
[01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:34.302]  Hopefully by now you've had a chance to read my letter
[01:30:35.226 --> 01:30:37.087]  We have questions, Mr. President.
[01:30:37.107 --> 01:30:38.628]  Lots of questions.
[01:30:38.648 --> 01:30:40.310]  A lot of them are detailed in my letter.
[01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:43.572]  But trust me, there are hundreds more questions.
[01:30:43.592 --> 01:30:45.893]  As my letter chronicles, sir,
[01:30:58.127 --> 01:31:06.429]  The 9-11 Commission itself says they were lied to, deceived, and essentially prevented from carrying out a real investigation.
[01:31:06.449 --> 01:31:11.410]  The people of the United States and the world demand the truth, sir.
[01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:13.130]  We have to continuously ask questions.
[01:31:13.150 --> 01:31:14.250]  That's what a patriot does.
[01:31:14.290 --> 01:31:15.630]  That's what a true American does.
[01:31:15.650 --> 01:31:16.551]  We ask questions.
[01:31:20.471 --> 01:31:24.252]  You, sir, have the power as well as the responsibility
[01:31:24.963 --> 01:31:31.845]  To initiate a truly independent congressional investigation into the events of 9-11, as well as its aftermath.
[01:31:32.905 --> 01:31:34.486]  We want our country back, Mr. President.
[01:31:35.146 --> 01:31:42.869]  Therefore, I'm not just calling on you and your team, I'm calling on each and every American citizen to wake up, stand up, and demand the truth.
[01:31:44.369 --> 01:31:45.629]  We're counting on you, Mr. President.
[01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:48.870]  Be on the right side of history.
[01:31:52.091 --> 01:31:53.412]  And what did Thomas Jefferson say?
[01:31:55.404 --> 01:31:57.706]  What did he say the truest form of patriotism is?
[01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:03.952]  Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.
[01:32:04.012 --> 01:32:04.853]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:32:07.415 --> 01:32:11.179]  Are you now saying that they weren't asking to block an investigation?
[01:32:11.339 --> 01:32:13.261]  An investigation must not interfere.
[01:32:14.793 --> 01:32:18.736]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, that's Charlie Sheen's video message to the President.
[01:32:18.756 --> 01:32:20.478]  You've heard him live for an hour on air.
[01:32:20.498 --> 01:32:20.558]  And...
[01:32:42.589 --> 01:32:46.832]  All of this is possible because of the listeners, the sponsors, the Genesis Network, my crew here.
[01:32:46.852 --> 01:32:48.753]  I want to thank all of our sponsors.
[01:32:50.595 --> 01:32:53.337]  We skipped three of the breaks today, but those will be replaced.
[01:32:56.379 --> 01:33:01.682]  It's just amazing, and we really are asking for it doing this, but you've got to stand up to murderers.
[01:33:01.702 --> 01:33:02.563]  You've got to stand up to tyranny.
[01:33:02.963 --> 01:33:08.187]  Our ancestors did this at many key junctures, and many of them paid with their lives or their treasure or their names.
[01:33:10.951 --> 01:33:14.278]  All real men and women have to stand up against evil and corruption.
[01:33:14.298 --> 01:33:18.566]  And I told you back on Monday, before all this was launched, that Tuesday was only the beginning.
[01:33:19.928 --> 01:33:20.629]  It's about making it
[01:33:23.075 --> 01:33:24.376]  A debate with the President.
[01:33:24.396 --> 01:33:27.198]  It's about making it an issue and putting it on the plate of the President.
[01:33:27.218 --> 01:33:30.641]  It's about forcing those 20 points out there to be looked at.
[01:33:30.681 --> 01:33:37.906]  And no doubt, hundreds of major newspapers and hundreds of blogs and thousands of websites have posted 20 Minutes with the President.
[01:33:38.406 --> 01:33:45.432]  Tens of millions conservatively, just three and a half, four days into this operation against the New World Order, have read 20 Minutes with the President.
[01:33:46.471 --> 01:33:49.755]  I asked people to pray for us as well and pray for Charlie and pray for myself.
[01:33:49.775 --> 01:33:52.558]  A lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that I won't even get into here.
[01:33:53.078 --> 01:33:54.500]  But we cheerfully take it all.
[01:33:55.701 --> 01:33:56.622]  You've seen history here.
[01:33:56.702 --> 01:33:58.704]  Black Ops tried to stir things up on Tuesday.
[01:33:58.744 --> 01:33:59.145]  Didn't work.
[01:34:00.216 --> 01:34:01.437]  And we rolled over that.
[01:34:01.497 --> 01:34:02.699]  Thanks to all of you getting the word out.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:06.123]  And now his video address, the President, is all over the web.
[01:34:06.223 --> 01:34:08.345]  Every major video site I looked at is the top video.
[01:34:09.006 --> 01:34:09.687]  It's just exploding.
[01:34:09.747 --> 01:34:11.849]  Go to InfoWars.com and be part of the fight.
[01:34:12.190 --> 01:34:16.214]  Click on the big banner at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:16.274 --> 01:34:17.516]  It says 20 minutes with the President.
[01:34:17.956 --> 01:34:20.840]  And it's got the 20 minutes with the President, the audio interviews, the video interviews.
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.402]  When he was live on the show a few days ago for 10 minutes, the hour-long interview will be posted there today.
[01:34:25.702 --> 01:34:33.065]  But most importantly, the video addressed to the President by Charlie Sheen with all those key facts you just heard and saw, posted right there at the top.
[01:34:33.105 --> 01:34:36.106]  Take that video and send it to your entire email list.
[01:34:36.126 --> 01:34:37.166]  Show it to your co-workers.
[01:34:38.427 --> 01:34:40.147]  Print off the URL and the article.
[01:34:40.187 --> 01:34:40.827]  Give it to people.
[01:34:41.888 --> 01:34:42.508]  And don't stop.
[01:34:42.548 --> 01:34:44.549]  You're watching this six months from now, a year from now.
[01:34:46.018 --> 01:34:46.859]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:34:47.679 --> 01:34:51.822]  We have no future if these terrorists that committed these attacks are able to continue to operate.
[01:34:52.502 --> 01:34:57.245]  All of you that serve this evil system and black ops, they're putting stuff in your water, they're putting stuff in your vaccines.
[01:34:57.606 --> 01:34:59.747]  This is a diabolical group of eugenicists.
[01:35:00.207 --> 01:35:10.394]  The White House science chief wrote the government textbook, Ecoscience, John P. Holdren calling for sterilizing us, poisoning us, putting poisons in our water.
[01:35:11.895 --> 01:35:12.576]  This is real.
[01:35:12.716 --> 01:35:15.758]  Reality is so much wilder than most people can even imagine.
[01:35:17.191 --> 01:35:19.533]  And I just commend the courage of Charlie Sheen.
[01:35:19.553 --> 01:35:21.274]  He's an incredible person when you know him in person.
[01:35:22.334 --> 01:35:23.535]  And he's a great family man.
[01:35:25.396 --> 01:35:26.737]  Imagine, he became a famous movie star.
[01:35:26.757 --> 01:35:28.458]  He was like 16 in Red Dawn.
[01:35:30.579 --> 01:35:32.340]  All those big movies when he was 20, 21, 22.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.804]  And all the media can do is focus on little petty things in his past.
[01:35:40.486 --> 01:35:45.029]  When it's well-known what goes on in Washington, dwarfs anything she never did, or the exaggerations.
[01:35:45.089 --> 01:35:46.570]  He is an amazing person.
[01:35:47.571 --> 01:36:07.025]  And, again, I know a lot of other big Hollywood people that I've run into over the years, and I've consulted on films, and been in a few films, like Scanner Darkly, Waking Life, Winona Ryder, Woody Harrelson, Keanu Reeves, a lot of others I'm not going to mention, even bigger.
[01:36:07.995 --> 01:36:08.975]  Because they've asked me not to.
[01:36:09.356 --> 01:36:11.957]  They don't have the courage that Charlie Sheen has.
[01:36:12.017 --> 01:36:13.097]  And I'm not saying they're bad people.
[01:36:14.118 --> 01:36:19.120]  I'm just saying that Bruce Willis went public somewhat, but I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:27.844]  I'm going to let Bruce... What Bruce really says he believes, I'm going to just... He said the same people that killed Kennedy are running things now and he no longer follows the phony Republicans or the Democrats.
[01:36:28.184 --> 01:36:33.066]  He had a paradigm shift, but... I challenge Bruce Willis to contact us and come on the show.
[01:36:34.247 --> 01:36:34.767]  I challenge...
[01:36:35.919 --> 01:36:36.660]  All these other people.
[01:36:37.121 --> 01:36:42.268]  And I challenge people in the media, and people in music, and people in entertainment to come public.
[01:36:42.288 --> 01:36:43.250]  They can't stop us all.
[01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:49.800]  And that's what the big announcement is, is that we're standing up with courage, we're taking action, and Charlie Sheen's asking for your help right now today.
[01:36:51.656 --> 01:37:03.165]  And instead of letting the media put out all their hit pieces, put out their disinfo, use the 9-11 staged attacks to set up more of a police state, to use Homeland Security against conservatives, gun owners, veterans, as they now admit they're doing.
[01:37:03.205 --> 01:37:04.426]  They built this whole police state.
[01:37:04.706 --> 01:37:07.609]  From day one, it was meant for the American people and the people of the world.
[01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:09.690]  Same systems are being set up worldwide.
[01:37:11.772 --> 01:37:13.653]  We're standing up and saying, we're not going along with this.
[01:37:13.693 --> 01:37:14.134]  We're done.
[01:37:16.428 --> 01:37:25.272]  We're saying that we understand the control grid that's being set up and we understand our children and grandchildren and their children have no future if we don't stop this scientific dictatorship.
[01:37:25.292 --> 01:37:28.313]  I'm going to take some phone calls now.
[01:37:28.373 --> 01:37:29.293]  Danny in Tennessee.
[01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:30.093]  Danny, you're on the air.
[01:37:31.734 --> 01:37:32.254]  Hi, Alex.
[01:37:32.995 --> 01:37:33.315]  Welcome.
[01:37:34.795 --> 01:37:39.897]  I just want to start off by saying thank you to Charlie Sheen for his great effort.
[01:37:41.278 --> 01:37:43.899]  And I know the great amount of courage it takes for him to do that.
[01:37:44.879 --> 01:37:46.100]  And, uh, it's been a while.
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:46.781]  You have no idea.
[01:37:47.481 --> 01:37:50.943]  The White House indicted Mark Cuban over even helping us.
[01:37:51.644 --> 01:37:52.384]  And then Mark Viet.
[01:37:53.465 --> 01:38:03.472]  I remember all those, I remember all those, uh, all those things happening, you know, as we've gone along, uh, trying to make progress and, you know, expose the truth.
[01:38:03.512 --> 01:38:04.293]  This is, you know, it's a war.
[01:38:04.333 --> 01:38:06.855]  I mean, do people realize what we're doing as leaders in this?
[01:38:08.058 --> 01:38:16.880]  I mean, we're in the arena with a 9-foot, 500-pound, vicious, fire-breathing gladiator of the New World Order.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:27.101]  Yep, and I don't think a lot of people appreciate what you are doing, and people like Charlie, and all the other great leaders.
[01:38:28.162 --> 01:38:35.643]  But I want to also make a key point, and I want people to be thinking about it, because
[01:38:37.116 --> 01:38:40.658]  I want people to start realizing that we need to expose the Bilderbergs.
[01:38:40.978 --> 01:38:44.280]  And, you know, more people need to be focused on those people.
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:48.522]  Yeah, the real power elite, not just the puppets like Obama.
[01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:53.004]  And on the flu hype they're having, and on the financial implosion, we try to cover it all.
[01:38:53.844 --> 01:38:57.246]  Those are the people that right now are probably, you know, looking at this new thing.
[01:38:57.266 --> 01:38:58.187]  In fact, bring in Game in here.
[01:38:58.207 --> 01:38:58.727]  It's on the table.
[01:38:58.927 --> 01:38:59.267]  Go ahead.
[01:38:59.467 --> 01:39:00.128]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:39:00.168 --> 01:39:00.668]  Those are the people.
[01:39:00.688 --> 01:39:00.988]  Go ahead.
[01:39:01.948 --> 01:39:03.109]  Those are the people in my heart.
[01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:06.831]  I believe they're looking at everything we do and, you know, they know what's going on.
[01:39:07.799 --> 01:39:13.903]  And they're the ones that sit there and call the shots and say, you know, oh look, they're going after our puppet Obama.
[01:39:14.203 --> 01:39:17.665]  You know, they come up with the plan.
[01:39:17.925 --> 01:39:28.111]  They come up with a plan of action and, you know, that's why the media, they block for Obama and then Obama blocks for those people.
[01:39:28.331 --> 01:39:28.972]  That's right.
[01:39:29.012 --> 01:39:29.992]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:30.052 --> 01:39:31.213]  Great football analogy.
[01:39:33.174 --> 01:39:37.998]  And what we put in this film two years ago is totally documented in the government's own textbook.
[01:39:38.919 --> 01:39:39.579]  Ecoscience.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:41.060]  Absolutely.
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:42.421]  Good job, Danny, with those points.
[01:39:42.722 --> 01:39:43.602]  Tom in New Hampshire.
[01:39:43.642 --> 01:39:44.383]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:39:44.403 --> 01:39:46.465]  Alex, great to be on with you.
[01:39:46.485 --> 01:39:47.626]  It's an honor.
[01:39:48.286 --> 01:39:49.067]  Honor to have you with us.
[01:39:49.087 --> 01:39:52.930]  Do you think this is the last chance for 9-11 truth to come through?
[01:39:53.610 --> 01:39:54.831]  No, we're never going to stop.
[01:39:55.192 --> 01:39:55.972]  We're never going to stop.
[01:39:56.012 --> 01:39:58.414]  They're running hit pieces on us daily because they're scared of us.
[01:39:59.735 --> 01:40:00.075]  But no.
[01:40:01.556 --> 01:40:05.580]  We do need to expose government-sponsored terror to take that tool away from them, but expose the flu.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.183]  I mean, I was on air January saying everything that was going to happen.
[01:40:08.583 --> 01:40:12.527]  I understand their operation, but yes, we need to all stand up and get involved.
[01:40:13.569 --> 01:40:15.210]  Seems like a really important year.
[01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:19.695]  You know, you've got the economic collapse coming around the corner, and then we could have dictatorship.
[01:40:20.051 --> 01:40:27.938]  And they meant to use 9-11 to get the police state in control so they can engineer the engineered collapse and use that police state on us.
[01:40:28.039 --> 01:40:28.979]  Yes, it is key.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:33.704]  But now we've got all these mainline conservative talk shows talking about Obama.
[01:40:33.724 --> 01:40:38.809]  In fact, queue up for me, Savage, saying the government may stage terror attacks or is going to do it.
[01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:40.771]  That idea is now out there.
[01:40:41.491 --> 01:40:44.292]  And we've caused a massive awakening thanks to everybody taking action.
[01:40:44.672 --> 01:40:46.593]  So the news here is we're engaging them.
[01:40:46.613 --> 01:40:47.493]  We're having an effect.
[01:40:47.793 --> 01:40:48.553]  We have power.
[01:40:48.954 --> 01:40:49.974]  That's my main message.
[01:40:51.574 --> 01:40:53.175]  So why do people in the media go along?
[01:40:54.115 --> 01:41:04.099]  Because they're whores, and they have mortgages, and they enjoy the power trips of being on TV, and they haven't... They just are worldly.
[01:41:04.119 --> 01:41:04.939]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:04.979 --> 01:41:05.859]  Really good points, Tom.
[01:41:06.219 --> 01:41:07.260]  Adrian in Rhode Island.
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:08.100]  Adrian, you're on the air.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.440]  Hey, Alex.
[01:41:09.541 --> 01:41:10.041]  It's great to be on.
[01:41:12.234 --> 01:41:19.817]  I'm a big fan of most of your work, especially the way you fight back against, you know, the Orwellian perpetual state of war we have going on in this country, so thank you for that.
[01:41:21.578 --> 01:41:26.480]  That being said, though, I have to contribute a Jeffersonian, patriotic, defending voice here today.
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:35.804]  Just specifically, I've noticed in the last week, like, there have been a couple articles on your InfoWars site that have been a little bit intolerant of homosexuality, it seems.
[01:41:37.366 --> 01:41:38.807]  Well, sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:41:38.827 --> 01:41:51.513]  Look, I'm not up here with bashing people, hating people, but we posted articles about how they have the quote lesbian rangers in Canada who go around harassing heterosexuals and trying to bring in hate speech laws.
[01:41:52.433 --> 01:41:54.354]  So, that's what I'm against.
[01:41:55.094 --> 01:41:55.455]  Okay?
[01:41:56.155 --> 01:41:58.076]  I'm against guilds of people
[01:41:59.508 --> 01:42:22.791]  getting together and and I mean with the CPS they take heterosexual family homeschoolers kids on record and give it to the gay and lesbian families so I'm not saying all the gay people are involved in this but there are gangs of different gangs of people that's how humans arrange themselves and it's wrong and they shouldn't teach anything sexual to six or seven-year-olds in schools there's there's recruiting going on
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:28.002]  And just stay away from our kids, man, regardless, with any type of stuff.
[01:42:28.723 --> 01:42:30.404]  All this recruiting, all this agenda.
[01:42:31.244 --> 01:42:31.604]  Okay?
[01:42:32.184 --> 01:42:38.228]  Gay folks don't have children, so they replicate by recruitment.
[01:42:38.948 --> 01:42:46.752]  And that's fine with consenting adults, but just, look, there's a lot of really bad stuff and out-of-control, self-destructive stuff.
[01:42:47.032 --> 01:42:51.835]  Gay men have the lowest life expectancy in the country, even below black men, who are next.
[01:42:52.543 --> 01:42:57.327]  I mean, I care about these people, but it's very destructive what's going on.
[01:42:57.347 --> 01:42:57.747]  Okay?
[01:42:58.027 --> 01:42:58.648]  Very, very simple.
[01:43:01.476 --> 01:43:05.799]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:43:05.999 --> 01:43:08.421]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:43:08.581 --> 01:43:09.322]  He was devastated.
[01:43:09.462 --> 01:43:18.129]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:43:18.249 --> 01:43:24.153]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:43:24.453 --> 01:43:26.955]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:43:27.155 --> 01:43:29.537]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[01:43:30.678 --> 01:43:36.880]  And he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:47.662]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[01:43:47.822 --> 01:43:51.783]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[01:43:51.843 --> 01:43:54.584]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com
[01:43:54.824 --> 01:43:58.425]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:43:58.605 --> 01:44:01.165]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:44:02.125 --> 01:44:07.446]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:07.946 --> 01:44:14.928]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:44:15.528 --> 01:44:21.689]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:22.109 --> 01:44:23.950]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:26.491]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:26.592 --> 01:44:37.537]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:38.158 --> 01:44:39.458]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:39.839 --> 01:44:41.219]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:47.903]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:48.593 --> 01:44:56.378]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:56.858 --> 01:44:57.999]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:58.439 --> 01:44:59.620]  The people strike back!
[01:45:01.989 --> 01:45:10.632]  Did you know that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles, wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[01:45:10.952 --> 01:45:13.413]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy.
[01:45:13.614 --> 01:45:14.974]  This book is for you.
[01:45:15.334 --> 01:45:20.416]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth, and it's called, Here's What You Do.
[01:45:20.736 --> 01:45:24.478]  You can buy it for only $6 at here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:26.639]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:45:26.959 --> 01:45:29.159]  Again, here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:30.200]  Buy it today.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:32.080]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:36.642]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:45:36.822 --> 01:45:42.523]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:45:42.623 --> 01:45:46.044]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:45:46.264 --> 01:45:49.145]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:45:51.146 --> 01:45:53.906]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:45:54.046 --> 01:45:54.346]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:45:56.907 --> 01:45:58.368]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:58.508 --> 01:46:12.058]  This is your chance to be part of this history-making event and to be on the right side of history.
[01:46:14.076 --> 01:46:21.944]  Go to Infowars.com, get Charlie's address to the President, email it out to everybody you know, call and talk radio shows, take our press releases, get them out to everybody.
[01:46:21.964 --> 01:46:23.926]  This thing has gone mega-viral.
[01:46:23.946 --> 01:46:29.332]  This is probably double the size of the biggest thing I've ever done previously, and that was Charlie Sheen three years ago.
[01:46:29.352 --> 01:46:32.835]  And there was Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura going public on this show.
[01:46:32.875 --> 01:46:34.157]  They chose this show to go public.
[01:46:35.769 --> 01:46:38.992]  And people are out there on the web making a big deal about it.
[01:46:39.012 --> 01:46:40.173]  Charlie Sheen goes to Washington.
[01:46:40.213 --> 01:46:42.614]  He has gone to Washington with his 20 points.
[01:46:42.654 --> 01:46:43.855]  That's on the White House desk.
[01:46:44.276 --> 01:46:45.036]  Gibbs has seen it.
[01:46:45.096 --> 01:46:45.637]  They admit it.
[01:46:46.377 --> 01:46:47.498]  No doubt they're aware of this.
[01:46:47.899 --> 01:46:49.300]  It's all over national news.
[01:46:50.541 --> 01:46:54.724]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I commend everyone for the great job they did.
[01:46:54.744 --> 01:46:55.644]  You know, the last caller
[01:46:56.545 --> 01:46:59.166]  Sir, none of us are going to agree with each other on everything.
[01:46:59.727 --> 01:47:06.790]  I would imagine you don't agree with your mom or dad or your cousin on every issue, or your preacher, or your boss, or your employees.
[01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:10.051]  It isn't about us all agreeing with each other on every issue.
[01:47:10.331 --> 01:47:11.692]  We have staged terror attacks.
[01:47:11.712 --> 01:47:15.234]  We have $23.7 trillion stolen in the first 10 months of the bailout and growing.
[01:47:15.874 --> 01:47:17.256]  We have all these wars.
[01:47:17.816 --> 01:47:23.963]  Obama putting 50,000 contractors in, taking 50,000 troops out, sending them to Afghanistan, increasing the number of troops overall.
[01:47:24.404 --> 01:47:25.745]  We have him lying about everything.
[01:47:26.166 --> 01:47:28.028]  We have indefinite detention continuing.
[01:47:28.088 --> 01:47:29.950]  Northcombing turned loose on the American people.
[01:47:30.411 --> 01:47:31.552]  These are the issues.
[01:47:31.632 --> 01:47:33.895]  So, we can't be diverted or distracted.
[01:47:35.117 --> 01:47:37.559]  The COINTELPRO operatives want us to all fight with each other.
[01:47:37.579 --> 01:47:38.460]  I'm not saying you were that.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:48.849]  I'm saying they use that natural tribalism over race and issues and sexual preference and income level and where you're from and where you live.
[01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:50.110]  It's stupid!
[01:47:50.911 --> 01:47:52.592]  And the globalists try to play on all that.
[01:47:52.612 --> 01:47:56.116]  We have a tiny elite waging war against humanity.
[01:47:57.065 --> 01:47:59.911]  And we've got to get up, stand up, and demand the truth.
[01:47:59.931 --> 01:48:02.756]  I'll have other big developments Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:48:02.796 --> 01:48:03.438]  here live.
[01:48:03.898 --> 01:48:06.023]  I'm finishing in the next week and a half for all the Republic.
[01:48:07.813 --> 01:48:10.194]  We are working around the clock to fight the New World Order.
[01:48:10.214 --> 01:48:12.275]  We're working around the clock to resist tyranny.
[01:48:12.315 --> 01:48:13.396]  We're doing everything we can.
[01:48:13.436 --> 01:48:14.196]  We're not perfect.
[01:48:14.616 --> 01:48:15.417]  We make mistakes.
[01:48:15.497 --> 01:48:17.017]  We don't get it 100% every time.
[01:48:17.337 --> 01:48:18.118]  But we're trying.
[01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:20.859]  It's that Teddy Roosevelt quote about, we're in the arena.
[01:48:21.299 --> 01:48:23.060]  Get in the arena and fight for your future.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:26.502]  A global corporate takeover is happening, run by eugenicists.
[01:48:27.262 --> 01:48:29.323]  For the globalists, a world government's only the beginning.
[01:48:29.743 --> 01:48:33.424]  It's the means to the end for worldwide extermination, for the endgame.
[01:48:33.444 --> 01:48:34.925]  You heard Charlie Sheen talk about it.
[01:48:34.945 --> 01:48:36.686]  And all the media people tuned in right now.
[01:48:37.146 --> 01:48:40.087]  And all your little fractionalized, factionalized groups.
[01:48:41.027 --> 01:48:41.987]  You better wake up.
[01:48:42.388 --> 01:48:43.588]  Stand up and demand the truth.
[01:48:43.608 --> 01:48:47.109]  You better get your thinking caps on and look at where our world's going.
[01:48:47.129 --> 01:48:54.692]  And look at your children tonight when you're home and ask, do you want to deliver them into the hands of this NORTHCOM Homeland Security Police State System?
[01:48:54.712 --> 01:48:56.433]  I mean, I've got mainstream news articles.
[01:48:57.133 --> 01:49:00.875]  Where the Girl Scouts have been hired by Homeland Security and FEMA?
[01:49:01.936 --> 01:49:03.117]  Mainstream news?
[01:49:04.538 --> 01:49:08.280]  Pull that up about Girl Scouts to work for Homeland Security, AP Reuters.
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.443]  And it says to look for terrorists, to help their families, to watch their families.
[01:49:13.224 --> 01:49:15.145]  And they want national compulsory service.
[01:49:15.185 --> 01:49:17.526]  That's what the beginning of Obama with the milquetoast speech.
[01:49:17.867 --> 01:49:22.890]  Getting the kids used to lining up in front of the big TV screens like 1984 and getting their marching orders.
[01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:25.812]  Obama's continuing everything Bush did under phony left cover.
[01:49:27.162 --> 01:49:29.063]  Shatter the left-right paradigm.
[01:49:30.203 --> 01:49:32.184]  Expose the bankers in the Fed.
[01:49:32.284 --> 01:49:33.685]  If we don't do this, it's over.
[01:49:34.305 --> 01:49:40.407]  I've been the most successful at fighting the New World Order of anybody on the planet, except for maybe Ron Paul, because I've understood how their system works.
[01:49:40.427 --> 01:49:41.768]  I've understood how they operate.
[01:49:42.048 --> 01:49:49.731]  And I've taught people and led by example for folks to learn how to stand up and to take on the globalist.
[01:49:50.782 --> 01:49:52.043]  This, this is serious.
[01:49:52.083 --> 01:49:52.624]  This is real.
[01:49:52.644 --> 01:49:55.907]  They're imploding the economy to make you be driven into the arms of the government.
[01:49:56.468 --> 01:49:57.909]  To make you be dependent on them.
[01:49:58.690 --> 01:50:00.032]  They don't want you to have a good life.
[01:50:00.072 --> 01:50:01.853]  They want to force vaccinations on you.
[01:50:01.893 --> 01:50:07.699]  They want to set precedents to have a medical, military, industrial complex prison we all live in.
[01:50:08.752 --> 01:50:10.213]  That's it for this amazing transmission.
[01:50:10.233 --> 01:50:11.494]  It was a totally jam-packed show.
[01:50:11.514 --> 01:50:13.035]  I won't even tell you about all the financial news.
[01:50:13.556 --> 01:50:14.296]  All of it we covered.
[01:50:14.337 --> 01:50:18.580]  What's happening with the Potomac situation and the D.C.
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:22.203]  New York flyovers and all the crazy stuff happening right now.
[01:50:22.503 --> 01:50:24.445]  The globalists are getting ready to launch terror attacks.
[01:50:24.505 --> 01:50:25.886]  I'm telling you, unless we get the word out.
[01:50:26.246 --> 01:50:26.847]  Preemptively.
[01:50:26.907 --> 01:50:28.688]  I saw them re-invoking 9-11.
[01:50:28.968 --> 01:50:31.250]  That's a key tell-tale sign that we're getting ready to launch an op.
[01:50:31.591 --> 01:50:33.212]  We're countering it and risking our lives.
[01:50:33.472 --> 01:50:34.273]  God bless you all.
[01:50:34.313 --> 01:50:35.074]  God bless the crew.
[01:50:35.374 --> 01:50:36.595]  God bless Charlie Sheen.
[01:50:36.895 --> 01:50:38.536]  See you back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:50:38.577 --> 01:50:39.537]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:39.758 --> 01:50:40.778]  InfoWars.com.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:44.542]  The war is now, folks.
[01:50:44.702 --> 01:50:45.502]  It's happening now.
[01:50:46.203 --> 01:50:47.464]  Stand up for yourselves now.
[01:50:48.125 --> 01:50:49.025]  It's happening now.
[01:50:49.045 --> 01:50:51.588]  Hello, friends.
[01:50:51.608 --> 01:50:52.108]  This is Alex Jones.
