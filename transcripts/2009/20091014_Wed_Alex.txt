[00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:14.246]  Today is the 14th day of October 2009, and just in case you don't know my voice, I am not Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.351]  I am Ted Anderson.
[00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:36.533]  I own the Genesis Communications Network.
[00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.814]  I also own Midas Resources Incorporated.
[00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:40.115]  Alex called me this morning.
[00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:47.320]  I had the pleasure of getting a call directly from Alex Jones in California, who happens to be shooting a film with Jesse Ventura.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.921]  Could you imagine being in that position?
[00:00:49.701 --> 00:01:02.365]  Well here I am and I just want to tell you that Alex Jones is out there fighting the battle and while he's doing that he asked me to give you a quick call because he knows that gold is going crazy and he wants me to give you a quick update.
[00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:05.046]  Gold right now has seen a low today of $1057.20 and a high today of $1066.10.
[00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:06.906]  Currently the last time I had looked at gold it was at $1062.60.
[00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:31.084]  You know, I often, I have people coming to me wondering if they should be selling their position in gold at this point, and they say that it's gone up so much in value, and they always look at me with these dull eyes when I say gold isn't increased in value at all.
[00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:34.785]  And they look at me and they wonder if I've gone crazy, and despite the fact that I have,
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.522]  Gold has not increased in value.
[00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:47.093]  The dollar, this Federal Reserve note that we use here as money in the United States of America, has gone down and is going down again today.
[00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:48.355]  Right now the dollar quoted at $75.63.
[00:01:52.379 --> 00:02:09.829]  Down 18 cents at this particular moment and just that is just another indicator of what's going on in the marketplace in case Those of you who sleep through the night and don't watch the Asian markets like I do Would know at this point in time that gold has already shot up over $1,070 an ounce and
[00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:26.796]  It happens in Asia and here in the United States where the manipulation is in favor of the US dollar and the banking system that is currently under control, so to speak, does like to push the US dollar up and
[00:02:27.236 --> 00:02:28.957]  Suppress the price of gold.
[00:02:28.957 --> 00:02:35.238]  And that's why we see here in the United States, when the New York market opens up, we have a tendency to see lower prices.
[00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.299]  I guess that's an advantage to us.
[00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.821]  I wish they'd give us lower prices, because it would give us a better opportunity to get out of their stinking fiat currency.
[00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:55.824]  Nonetheless, one way or the other, however you want to put it, the United States currency is on a downward slide, and I don't think that trend is going to stop, and I think it'd be foolish to sell your gold and silver and trade it back to Federal Reserve notes.
[00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:59.025]  Or anything that related to those.
[00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:04.587]  That would be including stocks, bonds, CDs, bank deposits, annuities, you name it.
[00:03:04.587 --> 00:03:08.248]  I don't think that there's anything that's safe out there other than precious metals.
[00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:10.929]  The real estate market has proven that to be true.
[00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:15.530]  Anything that's being priced based upon leverage, I would just get away from it.
[00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.491]  The United States has a tendency to
[00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:25.493]  Spend more than they can afford, and that's one of the reasons why we're seeing a continuous loss in the dollar.
[00:03:25.493 --> 00:03:27.214]  Why are the Asian markets being strong?
[00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:28.394]  Well, guess what?
[00:03:28.394 --> 00:03:31.735]  The Chinese are right, you know, is right in that market.
[00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:36.597]  The Asian markets have a tendency to rise more than the U.S.
[00:03:36.597 --> 00:03:40.558]  markets, and that's because the Chinese are sitting at about 3.3 trillion dollars of U.S.
[00:03:40.558 --> 00:03:42.479]  government securities.
[00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.659]  If they sell those U.S.
[00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.000]  government securities, which they continue to threaten to do,
[00:03:46.772 --> 00:03:51.053]  The United States dollar is going to lose purchasing power here at home for us.
[00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:53.914]  We're going to be paying more for what we need to buy.
[00:03:53.914 --> 00:04:05.297]  It's going to be like Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and a long list of countries that have thought that they could spend their way out of their own troubles and borrow money in the process.
[00:04:06.604 --> 00:04:18.054]  Fortunately for the United States, we've been doing that for many, many years, but we've had the ability to use our status as the world reserve currency.
[00:04:18.054 --> 00:04:23.158]  That occurs because if people want to buy oil out of the Middle East, they had to buy U.S.
[00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:26.982]  dollar first in order to have the ability to purchase that oil.
[00:04:26.982 --> 00:04:32.186]  Countries right now are looking at ways to get out of that agreement as quickly as possible.
[00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:33.785]  Call Midas today.
[00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:35.546]  We do have just a wonderful buy.
[00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:40.048]  I'm holding gold coins at the same price as I did when I was on the air with Alex yesterday.
[00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:40.269]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:41.930]  Ask the brokers for the special.
[00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.731]  The Lakota is currently right now $22.30.
[00:04:43.731 --> 00:04:44.671]  A fabulous buy.
[00:04:51.193 --> 00:04:56.118]  I mean, you just can't beat it.
[00:04:56.118 --> 00:04:56.558]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:04:56.558 --> 00:04:58.520]  Turn back the time machine and buy gold.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.221]  Enjoy the show.
[00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:00.182]  Alex has a great show.
[00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:07.929]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:14.014]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:16.677]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:16.957 --> 00:05:23.240]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.302]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.302 --> 00:05:32.664]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:35.004]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:35.004 --> 00:05:36.765]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.765 --> 00:05:39.285]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:44.006]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:47.707]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.707 --> 00:05:50.848]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:50.848 --> 00:05:52.728]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.849]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:07.281]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:13.167]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:19.314]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:21.614]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:24.075]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:37.257]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.257 --> 00:06:38.938]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.938 --> 00:06:40.798]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.798 --> 00:06:47.019]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:55.971]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:57.532]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.532 --> 00:06:58.733]  The people strike back!
[00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:06.053]  You've heard the Get The Tea commercials, and many people like our commercials, but I did notice something.
[00:07:06.053 --> 00:07:07.514]  What the heck is a toxin?
[00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:08.835]  So, here it is.
[00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:15.041]  A toxin is a poisonous substance that is capable of causing disease when introduced into the body.
[00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:18.264]  Formaldehyde, from seat cushions and particle board.
[00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:22.849]  How about carbon monoxide, furnace-burning propane, butane?
[00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:32.558]  Disinfectants, perfume, mouthwash, glues, air fresheners, pesticides, oh my gosh, even sugar is a toxin according to Dr. Lau.
[00:07:32.558 --> 00:07:34.419]  It's a very addictive drug.
[00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.682]  It's time to fight back.
[00:07:36.682 --> 00:07:39.224]  GetTheTea.com.
[00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:41.146]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:43.448]  Or you can get your trusty cell phone out and call us at 928-308-0408.
[00:07:47.311 --> 00:07:53.195]  Again, 928-308-0408, and put in your order today.
[00:07:53.195 --> 00:07:58.039]  Lose weight, feel good, and be free of all these toxins.
[00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:01.781]  Get the T.com.
[00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:13.609]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.609 --> 00:08:15.991]  Well, the Associated Press and Politico
[00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:21.091]  Have both reported in the last month that Obama has an enemies list.
[00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:23.391]  We know Bill Clinton had one.
[00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:32.555]  Now the Globe, which is about as good as the Enquirer, though they don't do Batboy and Aliens landing in Central Park, they claim that they have a White House source with the enemies list.
[00:08:32.555 --> 00:08:35.996]  I think this is a public threat to people.
[00:08:35.996 --> 00:08:38.957]  And we're going to be going over that after Ray McGovern leaves us.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.502]  Ray McGovern is one of President Ronald Reagan's intelligence briefers from 81 to 85.
[00:08:46.502 --> 00:08:56.726]  He was in charge of preparing the daily security briefings for Reagan and Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush and the National Security Advisor, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Cabinet.
[00:08:56.726 --> 00:09:03.789]  Later, McGovern was one of several senior CIA analysts who prepared the President's daily briefing during the first Bush administration.
[00:09:03.789 --> 00:09:05.590]  He also famously challenged
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:13.105]  Then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at a press conference, where are the WMDs?
[00:09:13.105 --> 00:09:17.829]  And of course, the Defense Secretary said, I never said they had WMDs.
[00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:23.194]  And he quoted Rumsfeld back and really devastated Rumsfeld.
[00:09:23.194 --> 00:09:26.176]  And that was really a turning point.
[00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:30.440]  Because Rumsfeld had been saying they had the WMDs and where they were in and around Tikrit.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.301]  Then he had to back off.
[00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:32.865]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:35.666]  Well, I don't write books because then I lose my wife.
[00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:05.243]  I heard somebody saying they heard you on Dallas radio about a book or something.
[00:10:05.243 --> 00:10:06.783]  Maybe you were talking about somebody else's book.
[00:10:06.783 --> 00:10:07.363]  Oh, I was.
[00:10:07.363 --> 00:10:14.644]  Yeah, I was talking about JFK and the Unspeakable, which is a book that people really should read.
[00:10:14.644 --> 00:10:28.607]  It's by James Douglas, and it goes over the most recently released data on the situation there in Dallas and elsewhere when John Kennedy was assassinated.
[00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:30.267]  It's very interesting.
[00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:38.757]  You know, I had dinner with Martin Sheen about a month ago, and he said it was the best JFK book he had read and was raving about it.
[00:10:38.757 --> 00:10:40.659]  I forgot to get a copy of it.
[00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:43.602]  He was going to give me a copy of it, but I forgot to get it.
[00:10:43.602 --> 00:10:45.644]  Why is everybody saying this book is so powerful?
[00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:48.907]  I mean, you're a former top CIA analyst.
[00:10:48.907 --> 00:10:50.448]  You're reading it yourself.
[00:10:50.448 --> 00:10:53.571]  I want to get into Iran, but that's a subject I never raised with you.
[00:10:53.571 --> 00:10:56.254]  Is JFK, why are you so impressed with this book?
[00:10:57.628 --> 00:11:13.036]  Well, Alex, I have to confess that someone sent me that book about a year and a half ago, and as soon as I heard that it had this theory that it was the CIA, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and people who had been suborned to the Secret Service,
[00:11:13.997 --> 00:11:17.839]  That planned and executed the assassination of John Kennedy.
[00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:20.460]  As soon as I heard that, I said, well, this is pretty far out.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.701]  I've got lots of articles to write.
[00:11:22.701 --> 00:11:26.702]  I put it on my back shelf, but recently I've been reading it.
[00:11:26.702 --> 00:11:28.963]  I've almost finished.
[00:11:28.963 --> 00:11:38.047]  And I share the view of those who have read it before and told me that it's the most painstakingly researched piece of work.
[00:11:38.803 --> 00:11:44.346]  And that it includes the very latest data that's been released from FOIAs or from other things.
[00:11:44.346 --> 00:11:49.089]  He conducted incredible interviews with people on the spot.
[00:11:49.089 --> 00:11:59.115]  And the evidence that he adduces, and you know, I'm an intelligence analyst, so I know a little bit about this kind of thing, is very, very persuasive.
[00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:06.259]  And the reason that it has such current attention and applicability
[00:12:07.148 --> 00:12:24.305]  It's because the very forces that Jim Douglas claims did JFK in are still very much around, are still very much intimidating a new president, whose name happens to be Barack Obama.
[00:12:24.305 --> 00:12:31.652]  And if you just run down the line of things, it was Cuba, mostly, because JFK would not
[00:12:32.657 --> 00:12:36.504]  Save the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.
[00:12:36.504 --> 00:12:41.373]  The CIA and the Joint Chiefs got very mad about that.
[00:12:42.205 --> 00:12:56.035]  When JFK wouldn't launch a nuclear war on the Soviet Union during the missile crisis in 1962, that got the Joint Chiefs really mad because they knew they had the advantage of it.
[00:12:56.035 --> 00:13:01.398]  They told them, look, Mr. President, it would only mean about 20 million of us killed, but we'd kill all the Russians.
[00:13:01.398 --> 00:13:03.199]  That kind of logic.
[00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:03.980]  That was L.L.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.881]  Lemitzer and Kurt Lishlamet, wasn't it?
[00:13:05.881 --> 00:13:06.582]  Yeah.
[00:13:06.582 --> 00:13:09.204]  Yeah, it was that crowd.
[00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:16.290]  That crowd was described by George Ball, the Deputy Secretary of State, as a cesspool.
[00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:21.154]  They're the ones that plant things like Northwoods and other things.
[00:13:21.154 --> 00:13:29.641]  It's hard to put yourself back into those years, but there was such an incredible, visceral, knee-jerk anti-communism.
[00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:39.501]  That again, the Joint Chiefs thought it would be just fine if we did involve the Soviet Union in return to just, you know, maybe 20 million casualties here.
[00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:54.635]  John Kennedy faced into that, and not only that, but he started talking with Castro independently and secretly, he thought, because the CIA knew about it, and he had a private correspondence with Nikita Khrushchev.
[00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:01.571]  He made a big speech at American University, saying we ought to get along with the Soviet Union.
[00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:06.572]  What do you know, but three months later, the Limited Test Pair Treaty is signed.
[00:14:06.572 --> 00:14:12.213]  The JCS, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was cut out of those negotiations.
[00:14:12.213 --> 00:14:15.654]  So, you can understand how they felt about that.
[00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:22.095]  And last, but not least, was Vietnam, where John Kennedy was convinced it was a fool's errand.
[00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:34.640]  And he could not convince the Joint Chiefs, nor his immediate advisors like McNamara and Rusk, and so he had to sort of surreptitiously move toward removing all our troops.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:42.504]  And before he died, he ordered that the first thousand troops be brought home before the end of the year, 63.
[00:14:42.504 --> 00:14:44.205]  And he started issuing U.S.
[00:14:44.205 --> 00:14:50.408]  greenbacks and was beginning to phase out the Federal Reserve and giving anti-Federal Reserve speeches.
[00:14:51.272 --> 00:15:09.240]  Yeah, he was running into lots of problems, and you know when Dwight Eisenhower warned about the military-industrial complex, well already what he was seeing was a military-industrial-congressional-media complex, which we have in full swing right now.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:18.284]  And so he's really up against it, and so I admire him even more than I used to in facing right into that, and it's not at all difficult for me to believe anymore.
[00:15:19.439 --> 00:15:35.444]  The people who both felt personally threatened and also felt that this fellow was selling out to the communists, took it upon themselves to plan this thing, carry it off, and then appoint people to investigate it, in quotes, who would come out with the best
[00:15:37.463 --> 00:15:44.769]  The right conclusion, the politically correct conclusion that this Lee Harvey Oswald did it all alone.
[00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:46.190]  No one believes that anymore.
[00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:57.519]  So, you know, the applicability of this thing with, here's Barack Obama, his big de-ribboned and de-meddled general officers are telling him,
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.965]  We're gonna suffer defeat in Afghanistan if you don't give us 40, 45,000 more troops.
[00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:09.449]  That's exactly the same situation that JFK faced.
[00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:12.812]  What about the secret Pentagon document that came out two weeks ago?
[00:16:12.812 --> 00:16:15.855]  Is there any validity to that from your research, Ray McGovern?
[00:16:15.855 --> 00:16:19.899]  Where they're saying they need 500,000 troops over the next five years?
[00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:24.623]  Well, you know, Andrea Mitchell ran with that and I was really surprised because
[00:16:25.263 --> 00:16:34.608]  All the information that subsequently emerged does not indicate that that document talked about 500,000.
[00:16:34.608 --> 00:16:38.390]  What I think people did, perhaps, was interpolate.
[00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:53.358]  They look at the ratio that the current Army manual says, the ratio of troops to citizens that is necessary for a successful insurgency, and you multiply the numbers by the 38 million Afghans,
[00:16:53.798 --> 00:17:03.864]  And you'd get, you know, 500,000 or more troops that would be... Yeah, that was the original... Secretary White told Bush, you need 500,000 or 450,000 to be technical.
[00:17:03.864 --> 00:17:05.345]  And Bush said, no, I can do it with 150.
[00:17:05.345 --> 00:17:12.149]  And I guess there are 23 million in Iraq, so the ratio would be above 500,000, wouldn't it?
[00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:13.409]  Exactly right.
[00:17:13.409 --> 00:17:21.074]  And when you say 23 million in Iraq, I have to tell your listeners that there used to be 27 million in Iraq.
[00:17:21.926 --> 00:17:27.995]  That's not to say 4 million were killed, but 4 million have been displaced.
[00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:30.299]  A million, I believe, have been killed.
[00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:36.128]  And you have many millions, 2 million, living internally as refugees, and 2.5 million.
[00:17:36.738 --> 00:17:39.941]  Uh, let me go ahead, the adjoining states.
[00:17:54.739 --> 00:17:57.300]  Russia did not sneak attack Georgia, it was the other way around.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:05.703]  Obama is doing the right thing, saying he's going to pull missile systems out, but then he's hedging his bets from what I've seen, saying maybe some new system down the road.
[00:18:05.703 --> 00:18:17.948]  So what you see happening in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the U.S.-Russian relationship, and where all this is going, and then of course the $64 million question I want to cover first,
[00:18:19.062 --> 00:18:23.224]  From what I've read, the Iranians said, okay, in a few months we're going to open this new facility.
[00:18:23.224 --> 00:18:24.585]  They announced it.
[00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:33.389]  Our media spun it and said, we found a secret location, and it looks to me like another big lie, or am I incorrect?
[00:18:33.389 --> 00:18:37.291]  Well, unfortunately, you're correct, Alex.
[00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:38.931]  What we have here is Iraq.
[00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:42.714]  Part 2.
[00:18:42.714 --> 00:18:55.925]  You remember how the, what I call the, fawning corporate media, how they spun Iraq so we were all left to believe that there were weapons of mass destruction there and ties between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:55.925 --> 00:18:57.446]  None of that was right.
[00:18:57.446 --> 00:19:05.332]  And none of the hype that's going on now with respect to the, quote, Iranian nuclear threat, end quote, is right.
[00:19:06.101 --> 00:19:20.053]  It's hyperbole to the nth degree, and people in Congress in particular are having a feeding frenzy on things that they have so warped that the American citizen can't really understand what's going on.
[00:19:20.053 --> 00:19:21.674]  Try to put it in some context.
[00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:23.443]  Okay, do that after we got a break.
[00:19:23.443 --> 00:19:24.123]  We're going to come back.
[00:19:24.123 --> 00:19:25.665]  I'm going to give you the floor.
[00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:31.989]  I want you to break this down because I remember two and a half weeks ago, the Iranians have got all these different sites.
[00:19:31.989 --> 00:19:37.033]  The UN admits it can't get uranium above 95% to make weapons.
[00:19:37.033 --> 00:19:39.155]  The Iranians announced, here's a new site we've got.
[00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:47.001]  And then the media hoaxes it, saying they've got it, it was secret, we found it, boy we better attack them.
[00:19:47.001 --> 00:19:50.363]  Netanyahu's making secret trips to Russia to get green light.
[00:19:50.363 --> 00:19:52.725]  Russia starts saying we support sanctions.
[00:19:52.725 --> 00:19:53.966]  What's your intel?
[00:19:53.966 --> 00:19:56.248]  Does that mean Russia's gonna back an attack?
[00:19:56.248 --> 00:19:58.550]  We'll talk about it all with Ray McGovern.
[00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.771]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:02.192]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:20:02.192 --> 00:20:03.694]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:20:03.694 --> 00:20:05.034]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:20:05.034 --> 00:20:06.976]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:20:06.976 --> 00:20:15.782]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:21.206]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:20:21.206 --> 00:20:22.807]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:20:22.987 --> 00:20:30.469]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[00:20:30.469 --> 00:20:34.651]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.

[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.441]  Yeah.

[00:21:59.864 --> 00:22:01.666]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[00:22:01.666 --> 00:22:02.026]  October 14, 2009.
[00:22:02.026 --> 00:22:03.027]  Gold opened this morning at $1061.50.
[00:22:03.027 --> 00:22:06.351]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1090.89, $545.45 for a half ounce, or $272.72 for the quarter ounce.
[00:22:06.351 --> 00:22:07.052]  That's $1090.89, $545.45, and $272.72.
[00:22:19.665 --> 00:22:30.129]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:22:30.129 --> 00:22:33.331]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:22:33.331 --> 00:22:36.732]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:22:36.732 --> 00:22:39.493]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:22:39.713 --> 00:22:42.476]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:22:42.476 --> 00:22:45.420]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.723]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:22:47.723 --> 00:22:48.604]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.604 --> 00:22:54.351]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:54.351 --> 00:22:54.531]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:10.967 --> 00:23:12.372]  The answer is simple.
[00:23:12.372 --> 00:23:12.933]  Pure bulk.
[00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:15.619]  We're good to go!
[00:23:41.943 --> 00:23:42.624]  We're good.
[00:24:07.205 --> 00:24:18.308]  Well, we have a former senior CIA analyst, Ray McGovern, whose information has proven over the years to be very, very accurate in hindsight, joining us.
[00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:32.572]  Okay, Ray, you were getting into what's really happening with Iran and these sites, and what you agreed is a big hoax, saying that it was a secret site and they're going to nuke us in 45 minutes, changing the last letter in Iraq to Iran.
[00:24:33.852 --> 00:24:35.033]  Well, you got it, Alex.
[00:24:35.033 --> 00:24:36.113]  That's what's going on.
[00:24:36.113 --> 00:24:39.374]  It's hype that's really unconscionable.
[00:24:39.374 --> 00:25:01.403]  Let me go back a little ways here, because after the debacle on Iraq, when my former colleagues were visited several times by the Vice President, whose name is Cheney, and told to write a national intelligence estimate that said Saddam Hussein has all manner of weapons of mass destruction, that was October 1.
[00:25:04.839 --> 00:25:11.682]  After that happened, my former colleagues rose to the occasion and said, no more of that stuff.
[00:25:11.682 --> 00:25:12.962]  We're not going to do that anymore.
[00:25:12.962 --> 00:25:17.964]  We're going to tell the truth, which reverts back to the kind of atmosphere in which I worked.
[00:25:17.964 --> 00:25:25.847]  The only place in town without a political agenda, the only place in town that can tell the president without fear or favor what we really think.
[00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:31.686]  Now, to make that clear, when people say, well, how come you torture people?
[00:25:31.686 --> 00:25:34.467]  There are basically two CIAs, alright?
[00:25:34.467 --> 00:25:45.390]  The one that obeys the President's wishes and is able to do that under the National Security Act of 1947, the one that goes off and kidnaps people and tortures people.
[00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.131]  That's not the CIA I work in.
[00:25:48.131 --> 00:25:51.592]  I work in the analysis part and the part of the covert
[00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:55.801]  Agency that collected information, okay?
[00:25:55.801 --> 00:25:58.263]  And what I'm talking about now is that CIA.
[00:25:58.263 --> 00:25:59.344]  Now, what did we do?
[00:25:59.344 --> 00:26:02.707]  Well, we, okay, what did my former colleagues do?
[00:26:02.707 --> 00:26:16.018]  Well, uh, what we did, and I have to coin a phrase, is in 19, I'm sorry, 2006, we gave Bush and Cheney the finger.
[00:26:16.018 --> 00:26:17.899]  Uh, Tom finger.
[00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:19.561]  F-I-N-G-A-R.
[00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:34.306]  Who was an honest estimator, incredibly bright, came from the State Department and ran an estimate on Iran and its nuclear program, which is a bottom-up estimate.
[00:26:34.306 --> 00:26:43.131]  They spent months and months and months relooking at all the previous work, taking into account the most recent information, and they came up with some
[00:26:43.131 --> 00:26:43.291]  I'm good.
[00:26:58.424 --> 00:26:58.604]  I think?
[00:27:16.107 --> 00:27:24.110]  And the latest briefing of Congress indicates that the CIA believes, and the intelligence community as well, that they did not restart this.
[00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:33.793]  So this is a very curious way to be, as Defense Secretary Gates says, hell-bent on developing a nuclear weapon if you stop.
[00:27:33.793 --> 00:27:34.974]  Let's see, what's the math here?
[00:27:34.974 --> 00:27:36.894]  Six years ago, okay?
[00:27:36.894 --> 00:27:44.517]  And sir, didn't they say at the time, in the highly publicized report, that if Iran restarted it, it would take nine years?
[00:27:45.357 --> 00:28:01.535]  Well, they said 2015 or so, it was kind of a bracketed thing, and it all depended on how quickly they could enrich uranium to the weapons grade, and also what kind of delivery system they could get.
[00:28:02.256 --> 00:28:13.138]  No one, no one from a technical point of view said that Iran could be a threat to the United States in any time frame soon.
[00:28:13.138 --> 00:28:22.320]  They have no ICBMs, they have no method of delivering a weapon even if they restarted their work on weapons.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.581]  To whom are they a threat?
[00:28:24.581 --> 00:28:31.342]  Well, there's one other country in that region who actually has about 200
[00:28:32.526 --> 00:28:43.433]  Some people say 300 nuclear weapons deliverable by aircraft, by submarines, by surface ships, by missile.
[00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:46.075]  And the name of that country is Israel.
[00:28:46.075 --> 00:28:51.259]  And no one should shy away from mentioning that because that is the fly in the ointment.
[00:28:51.259 --> 00:28:59.905]  If there's a country in that region that has not signed a non-proliferation agreement,
[00:29:00.598 --> 00:29:10.747]  And has this kind of capability and the United States shows itself willing to invade a country like Iraq without that capability.
[00:29:10.747 --> 00:29:17.653]  Well, if I were an Iranian, you know, I would think long and hard about being able to have the option to have that capability.
[00:29:17.653 --> 00:29:22.818]  And so this estimate, this estimate said, we don't know whether the Iranians
[00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:24.384]  Right, gotta break!
[00:29:24.384 --> 00:29:25.304]  Long segment coming up.
[00:29:25.304 --> 00:29:25.965]  We'll continue there.
[00:29:25.965 --> 00:29:27.085]  Look at the latest hype!
[00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:46.210]  Iran announces they've got a facility.
[00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.171]  The media spins it and says we found a secret facility.
[00:29:49.171 --> 00:29:50.591]  We've got to attack.
[00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:51.992]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.992 --> 00:29:54.513]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.513 --> 00:29:57.214]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.972]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.972 --> 00:30:09.297]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.297 --> 00:30:11.338]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.338 --> 00:30:16.342]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.342 --> 00:30:17.263]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.523 --> 00:30:18.644]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.644 --> 00:30:20.526]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.526 --> 00:30:21.606]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.606 --> 00:30:23.808]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.808 --> 00:30:25.149]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:26.671]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.671 --> 00:30:31.935]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:35.518]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.518 --> 00:30:39.001]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:40.562]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.562 --> 00:30:41.463]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.463 --> 00:30:42.563]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.563 --> 00:30:43.504]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.504 --> 00:30:44.585]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.585 --> 00:30:47.647]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.647 --> 00:30:49.408]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.408 --> 00:30:50.329]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.075 --> 00:31:06.902]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.902 --> 00:31:14.491]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.491 --> 00:31:20.639]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:23.039]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:25.540]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:37.103]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.103 --> 00:31:38.783]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.783 --> 00:31:40.644]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.644 --> 00:31:46.865]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.552 --> 00:31:55.797]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.797 --> 00:31:57.378]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.378 --> 00:32:00.940]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.941]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:32:02.941 --> 00:32:06.203]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:32:06.203 --> 00:32:09.725]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:32:10.623 --> 00:32:19.845]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[00:32:19.845 --> 00:32:22.066]  Rely instead on oxysilver.
[00:32:22.066 --> 00:32:27.768]  Oxysilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:32:27.768 --> 00:32:32.529]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:32:33.209 --> 00:32:38.172]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[00:32:38.172 --> 00:32:41.294]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:32:41.294 --> 00:32:46.817]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.

[00:32:57.504 --> 00:32:59.105]  This call could save your life.
[00:33:24.418 --> 00:33:32.883]  Going back to Ray McGovern in just one moment as we continue to get a briefing from him, honored to have him, on what's really going on.
[00:33:32.883 --> 00:33:36.926]  He's one of the main people that came out and said the WMD thing is all a lie in Iraq.
[00:33:37.782 --> 00:33:42.944]  The yellow tubes, or the aluminum tubes, the yellow cake from Niger, all of it.
[00:33:42.944 --> 00:33:45.164]  And then now we know in hindsight it was all lies.
[00:33:45.164 --> 00:33:47.565]  And they literally are running the same playbook again.
[00:33:47.565 --> 00:33:52.487]  We'll talk to Ray McGovern in a moment, also talk about Russia, talk about Afghanistan, Pakistan.
[00:33:53.613 --> 00:33:55.254]  And to get his view on where all that is going.
[00:33:55.254 --> 00:34:00.295]  Before we do that, I want to remind listeners you can pre-order now my new film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:34:00.295 --> 00:34:04.677]  It ships on DVD on or before October 21st, just three weeks from now.
[00:34:04.677 --> 00:34:12.479]  This covers the banks, how they control both parties, how they mesmerize the population, how they're recruiting Stasi forces within the United States.
[00:34:12.479 --> 00:34:14.300]  It's all documented.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.621]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss, Fall of the Republic.
[00:34:18.621 --> 00:34:19.882]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:21.278 --> 00:34:24.060]  Also, Diginet.net.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.542]  They have sunglasses.
[00:34:25.542 --> 00:34:27.763]  The technology's really gotten small and inexpensive.
[00:34:27.763 --> 00:34:30.926]  They have a small chip recording in them with a tiny camera.
[00:34:30.926 --> 00:34:36.390]  No wires, where you can surveil, defend yourself when the police pull you over.
[00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:38.492]  It's got timecode stamps, so it's good in court.
[00:34:38.492 --> 00:34:41.955]  They have pins that have high-quality video and audio now.
[00:34:43.326 --> 00:34:45.408]  All available at Diginet.net.

[00:34:57.959 --> 00:34:59.060]  Okay, going back to Ray McGovern.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.382]  Ray, you'd left off with the CIA assessment
[00:35:09.503 --> 00:35:22.308]  2006, and then now we fast forward to they've taken some troops out of Iraq, replaced them with contractors, put 20,000 to 30,000 more troops and contractors in Afghanistan.
[00:35:22.308 --> 00:35:26.069]  They're saying on the news, we caught a secret nuke factory.
[00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:27.289]  We caught them.
[00:35:27.289 --> 00:35:28.250]  We caught them.
[00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.010]  It's incredible.
[00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.951]  And then a few days later, oh, did we catch them?
[00:35:31.951 --> 00:35:35.272]  Well, they made the announcement after they knew we knew.
[00:35:35.272 --> 00:35:37.673]  So break down what's really happening today.
[00:35:39.184 --> 00:35:57.194]  Well, we caught them several months ago, Alex, and they announced the existence of this new enrichment plant on their own initiative, and they did that just a week before the negotiations started.
[00:35:58.106 --> 00:36:11.932]  Your listeners perhaps need to be reminded that tomorrow is a very big day because the five Security Council members plus Germany and Iran are getting together to talk about the Iranian nuclear program.
[00:36:11.932 --> 00:36:15.794]  Now, that's why the hype is the pitch that it is.
[00:36:15.794 --> 00:36:24.358]  They're trying to, the media here, are trying to hype this thing up and say, well, look, now we've discovered a new enrichment facility.
[00:36:24.358 --> 00:36:27.519]  Well, we know about that enrichment facility for months.
[00:36:27.979 --> 00:36:42.472]  And now, the Iranians are claiming that they're well within their rights, under the treaties governing this kind of activity, to announce the establishment of this thing, because it's several, several months more before it gets ready to enrich anything.
[00:36:42.472 --> 00:36:51.380]  So, the hype is there, and the bottom line, people just need to realize that Iran is nowhere near
[00:36:52.293 --> 00:36:57.081]  Iran is years and years away from a nuclear weapon.
[00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:58.563]  Okay, I'll repeat that one more time.
[00:36:58.563 --> 00:37:00.727]  Years away from a nuclear weapon.
[00:37:00.727 --> 00:37:01.868]  Don't believe the hype.
[00:37:01.868 --> 00:37:03.992]  Don't believe what the Israelis are saying.
[00:37:03.992 --> 00:37:05.715]  These are technical questions, okay?
[00:37:06.317 --> 00:37:10.959]  Now, when I did the President's Daily Brief, I didn't write all the briefs, obviously.
[00:37:10.959 --> 00:37:22.622]  I know who the good analysts were, the honest, technical people, and it was a privilege to put their stuff in readable form and give it to the President.
[00:37:22.622 --> 00:37:26.684]  Well, now, I still know those folks, and I'm not getting this from a government head.
[00:37:26.684 --> 00:37:33.786]  I'm getting it from people like Greg Kielman, who ran the State Department, the INR, the research there, and the
[00:37:34.546 --> 00:37:37.810]  The intelligence outfit of the State Department was right.
[00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:42.556]  His people were right before the Iraq estimate there in 2002.
[00:37:42.556 --> 00:37:46.741]  And he now writes for the Arms Control Association.
[00:37:46.741 --> 00:37:48.643]  And it's the best stuff out there.
[00:37:48.643 --> 00:37:53.489]  Just Google Arms Control Association, you'll see what Greg Tilden is putting together.
[00:37:54.048 --> 00:37:55.729]  Well, Ray, boil it down for us then.
[00:37:55.729 --> 00:37:58.290]  What does Iran really have?
[00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.350]  What are they really doing?
[00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.651]  And A, why can Israel have weapons?
[00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:03.052]  Why can Pakistan have weapons?
[00:38:03.052 --> 00:38:04.472]  Why is that okay?
[00:38:04.472 --> 00:38:08.574]  But Iran's nowhere near it, and we're hearing, we gotta put sanctions on them.
[00:38:08.574 --> 00:38:11.475]  We gotta attack them.
[00:38:11.475 --> 00:38:13.916]  They could kill us any minute!
[00:38:13.916 --> 00:38:20.479]  Well, Alex, it will be no news to you that there is something in this country that I call the Likud Lobby.
[00:38:21.324 --> 00:38:31.107]  Uh, Likud being the hard right faction of the Israeli government, Israeli parties, and they have an ordinate influence in this country.
[00:38:31.107 --> 00:38:37.129]  And if you were to ask why it is that Congress is preparing, actually preparing as we speak,
[00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:46.625]  To pass a law that would actually be an act of war to interdict the supply of gasoline and such products to Iran.
[00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:47.726]  Why are they doing that?
[00:38:47.726 --> 00:38:56.190]  Well, it's because a lot of their money and a lot of their votes come from what I call the Likud lobby.
[00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:59.292]  People say... But why does Israel want to attack Iran?
[00:38:59.292 --> 00:39:04.254]  Well, you know, if you look at the Israelis and their frame of mind,
[00:39:04.847 --> 00:39:08.409]  And I think it's a terribly myopic frame of mind.
[00:39:08.409 --> 00:39:12.911]  I care about what happens to Israel, and I think it's exactly the wrong policy.
[00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:30.079]  They think that if they can zap the Iranian nuclear facility, as they did to the facility in Osirak in Iraq in 1983, then they can set the Iranians back, oh, five, ten years, perhaps, if they're allowed to do that.
[00:39:30.709 --> 00:39:37.471]  Now, that's very myopic, because the Iranians, unlike the Iraqis in those days, the Iranians can retaliate.
[00:39:37.471 --> 00:39:39.472]  They can close the straits.
[00:39:39.472 --> 00:39:43.914]  They can decimate our troops in Iraq.
[00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:46.515]  And they can hit Israeli cities even now.
[00:39:46.515 --> 00:39:49.776]  Not with a nuclear weapon, but with lots of missiles, okay?
[00:39:49.776 --> 00:39:52.337]  So, it would be bedlam if this happened.
[00:39:52.337 --> 00:39:56.598]  And yet, the Israelis are trying to get ROK to let them do it.
[00:39:56.598 --> 00:39:57.959]  This is lunacy.
[00:39:58.499 --> 00:40:01.521]  But they have this kind of frame of mind.
[00:40:01.521 --> 00:40:09.106]  Netanyahu, their Prime Minister in particular, that this must not be let happen, and that they're going to delay it as long as they can.
[00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:12.228]  If it takes an armed strike, they'll do it.
[00:40:12.228 --> 00:40:19.733]  Now, the only thing that is preventing them from doing it at this point, in my estimation, is this.
[00:40:19.733 --> 00:40:24.897]  Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is responsible for our troops and our security,
[00:40:25.658 --> 00:40:31.820]  has gone over to Israel, this time last year, and said, look, don't even think about it, okay?
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:37.922]  You fly your planes over our airspace in Iraq, we're going to shoot them down, okay?
[00:40:37.922 --> 00:40:48.465]  So don't even think about this, and don't think you can perpetrate the kind of incident like the Liberty incident back in June of 68, because we remember that.
[00:40:48.465 --> 00:40:51.886]  I'm a naval officer, and that's just not going to happen again.
[00:40:51.886 --> 00:40:53.006]  Now, that was pretty gutsy.
[00:40:53.661 --> 00:40:57.843]  And that put the kibosh on what the Israelis were planning the following August.
[00:40:57.843 --> 00:41:00.845]  Last August, not last August, but August of 2008.
[00:41:00.845 --> 00:41:02.545]  Let me go back.
[00:41:02.545 --> 00:41:05.647]  We had the Admiralty you just talked about.
[00:41:05.647 --> 00:41:10.309]  And then it leaked.
[00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:18.013]  It also leaked that, and a New Yorker covered it, MSNBC covered it, Cy Hirst talked about it.
[00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:22.645]  We'd all heard about how these radio calls were coming in.
[00:41:22.645 --> 00:41:27.087]  Iranian patrol boats attack, blow up the destroyers near the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:41:27.087 --> 00:41:28.468]  They're in the Gulf.
[00:41:28.468 --> 00:41:37.272]  And then it came out later that Cheney was discussing plans to paint up US ships like Iranian patrol boats and have them attack our ships.
[00:41:37.272 --> 00:41:38.712]  Now, this came out a
[00:41:41.653 --> 00:41:51.577]  Year after you on this show and other shows said, what I'm hearing from intelligence sources is, they may attack our ships and blame it on Iran.
[00:41:51.577 --> 00:41:53.798]  Were you being given specifics?
[00:41:53.798 --> 00:42:00.080]  Because it's one thing to get this from Sy Hersh a year after it happened, now two years ago.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:05.582]  It's another thing for you, and I remember the interviews a year before, to say that's what you were concerned about.
[00:42:06.314 --> 00:42:10.318]  Well, Alex, I wish I could brag about an inside source on this particular thing.
[00:42:10.318 --> 00:42:10.879]  I cannot.
[00:42:10.879 --> 00:42:15.284]  I was using what we in Army Intelligence used to call a swag factor.
[00:42:15.284 --> 00:42:16.986]  You know what that is?
[00:42:16.986 --> 00:42:17.747]  No.
[00:42:17.747 --> 00:42:21.811]  That's a scientific wild ass guess.
[00:42:21.811 --> 00:42:25.395]  So it's thin slicing or it's dead reckoning?
[00:42:25.802 --> 00:42:38.780]  Yeah, it's, you know, try to put yourself in the position of the Israelis and what success they had with the incident there where they killed the 34 of our seamen there and wounded 171 in June 8, 1967.
[00:42:43.223 --> 00:42:56.016]  And, you know, talk about Moxie or Chutzpah, they were quite capable of doing that again, particularly if they had an ally in the Vice President of the United States, which clearly they did.
[00:42:56.016 --> 00:43:00.481]  And when Cy Hirsch came out with that a year later, you can imagine my reaction.
[00:43:00.481 --> 00:43:03.164]  I said, wow, that was a good guess, McGovern.
[00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:05.266]  But it was just, at that point, a guess.
[00:43:06.033 --> 00:43:10.255]  Okay, we had Bayer on, the former CIA fellow for folks that don't know.
[00:43:10.255 --> 00:43:11.475]  Bayer?
[00:43:11.475 --> 00:43:32.925]  Yeah, and he said two years ago, and I don't trust him as much as I trust you, for obvious reasons, but he said, I'm worried about the Saudis staging a false flag to blame it on Iran, and then now we see more and more similar things coming out along those lines.
[00:43:32.925 --> 00:43:33.745]  What's your take on that?
[00:43:34.443 --> 00:43:40.108]  Well, Bob knows the area a lot better than I do, and I have great confidence in his judgment.
[00:43:40.108 --> 00:43:46.313]  You know, the Saudis are Sunni, the Iranians are Shia.
[00:43:46.313 --> 00:43:50.356]  It may seem like lunacy to us, but it matters a great deal in that area.
[00:43:50.356 --> 00:43:56.561]  And for the Iranians to become the preponderant power in that area, well, the Saudis don't like that at all.
[00:43:56.561 --> 00:43:59.504]  Whether they would resort to this kind of provocation or not,
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:06.865]  I don't know, but Bob would be in a much better position to speculate on that.
[00:44:06.865 --> 00:44:19.774]  Well, I mean, what is it like for you, knowing the region, studying it, when they get up on the news and say Iran is backing Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, when it's the opposite group, C.I.P., Cheney, are arch enemies.
[00:44:19.774 --> 00:44:24.158]  They fight more than they do with Christians or Jews, really, if you look at the statistics that I've looked at.
[00:44:24.798 --> 00:44:30.285]  I mean, that's like saying the Dallas Cowboys are the New York Giants.
[00:44:30.285 --> 00:44:32.728]  I mean, it's clearly two different groups.
[00:44:32.728 --> 00:44:41.659]  And then the famous case two and a half years ago with the president of Afghanistan and Bush says, yes, Iran is funding Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:42.199 --> 00:44:42.359]  Yeah.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:10.305]  Well, in answer to your question, Alex, I take this blood pressure medicine now, so when I listen to this kind of stuff.
[00:45:10.305 --> 00:45:17.810]  But all kidding aside, you know, when Bush was allowed to mischaracterize, maybe a nice way of saying things,
[00:45:18.827 --> 00:45:38.203]  All these very important developments and the mainstream press, people like Charlie Gibson, would just kind of say, oh, I refer specifically to Bush's famous exit interview where Charlie Gibson finally said, well, Mr. President, why did you really think you had to attack Iraq?
[00:45:38.203 --> 00:45:40.005]  And he said, oh, simple.
[00:45:40.005 --> 00:45:43.368]  Saddam Hussein wouldn't let the UN inspectors in.
[00:45:43.368 --> 00:45:45.309]  And Charlie Gibson said, oh, OK.
[00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:47.271]  And he goes on to the next question, you know?
[00:45:47.765 --> 00:45:50.566]  But he was letting the inspectors in.
[00:45:50.566 --> 00:45:52.587]  They were combing through his policies.
[00:45:52.587 --> 00:45:54.988]  They were interviewing his scientists one-on-one.
[00:45:54.988 --> 00:45:57.929]  It was George Bush that threw the U.N.
[00:45:57.929 --> 00:46:01.010]  inspectors out two days before shock and awe.
[00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:03.331]  And Charlie Gibson was taking it away with that.
[00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:04.771]  Let's get back to Iran.
[00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:07.132]  Here's, you know, I told you about the estimate here.
[00:46:07.132 --> 00:46:09.793]  It actually appeared in November of 07.
[00:46:09.793 --> 00:46:11.034]  They started working on it in 06.
[00:46:12.134 --> 00:46:16.718]  And so November 07, this big shock, namely, that the N.I.E.
[00:46:16.718 --> 00:46:27.426]  judges, and I used to chair these things, I know what kind of work goes into this, high confidence that Tehran had halted a covert nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003.
[00:46:27.426 --> 00:46:30.869]  What does the President say the following March?
[00:46:30.869 --> 00:46:40.416]  He says, quote, Iran has declared that it wants to be a nuclear power with a weapon to destroy people, including others in the Middle East, end quote.
[00:46:42.294 --> 00:46:43.715]  You know, that's made up.
[00:46:43.715 --> 00:46:47.858]  You know, you make that kind of stuff up, but you shouldn't be allowed to get away with it.
[00:46:47.858 --> 00:46:50.160]  Iran never declared any such thing.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:56.585]  As a matter of fact, the intelligence people were telling the President that Iran had ceased work on the nuclear weapons regime.
[00:46:56.585 --> 00:46:57.926]  And now they're hyping that again.
[00:46:57.926 --> 00:47:03.431]  I was watching CNN this morning and they cut to some female, blonde-haired comedian.
[00:47:03.431 --> 00:47:04.211]  I missed her name.
[00:47:05.146 --> 00:47:06.087]  As if it was news.
[00:47:06.087 --> 00:47:08.909]  They go, let's cut to see what she says about Iran.
[00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:13.574]  She's like, Ahmed Dinejad, how dare you say you want to nuke us and blow everything up?
[00:47:13.574 --> 00:47:14.314]  How dare you?
[00:47:14.314 --> 00:47:16.876]  We see through you, little man, little devil.
[00:47:16.876 --> 00:47:17.977]  And then she laughs.
[00:47:17.977 --> 00:47:20.440]  And I'm like, this is news now?
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:26.805]  When they always distort what he says, and I'm certainly not defending him or the Mullahs or any of them over there.
[00:47:26.805 --> 00:47:30.789]  The point is, is that it's all being manufactured again.
[00:47:30.789 --> 00:47:31.950]  They're beating the war drums.
[00:47:33.231 --> 00:47:34.312]  Here's the big issue.
[00:47:34.312 --> 00:47:41.396]  Do you think they're going to hit them, or will it be sanctions first, or will they false flag, or where is this going?
[00:47:41.396 --> 00:47:50.221]  Well, it depends on how staunchly the only reputable institution in our government stands up to this.
[00:47:50.221 --> 00:47:52.502]  I have a lot of admiration for Admiral Mullen.
[00:47:53.878 --> 00:48:00.446]  Uh, I think that, uh, you know, he's inclined and, you know, a neat jerk to obey orders.
[00:48:00.446 --> 00:48:10.118]  But he and his predecessor, Admiral Fallon, you remember Fallon quit when he was CENTCOM commander, uh, because he had said, we're not going to do Iran on my watch.
[00:48:11.071 --> 00:48:14.993]  And, uh, it took several months, but he was- Because he knows what'll happen!
[00:48:14.993 --> 00:48:19.014]  We should talk about what'll happen, the three different scenarios if Iran gets hit.
[00:48:19.014 --> 00:48:20.075]  That's exactly right.
[00:48:20.075 --> 00:48:27.238]  You know, and one of them, you know, one of them says, well, Iran has the capability of closing the Straits of Hormuz.
[00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:33.600]  Now, okay, that's where, like, two-thirds of the oil that comes out of the oil-rich Middle East has to come through, okay?
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.801]  Now, what's, uh, what's Mullen say to that question?
[00:48:36.801 --> 00:48:37.822]  He says, yes,
[00:48:38.522 --> 00:48:44.343]  The Iranians have the capability of closing the straits, but, but we can reopen them.
[00:48:44.343 --> 00:48:45.283]  Well, yeah.
[00:48:45.283 --> 00:48:46.924]  How are they going to reopen them?
[00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:52.124]  Send a Marine Division into the cliffs overlooking the Straits of Hormuz?
[00:48:52.124 --> 00:48:52.825]  Give me a break!
[00:48:52.825 --> 00:48:56.065]  When they've got 12,000 sunburned missiles aiming down.
[00:48:56.065 --> 00:48:58.706]  Yeah, and where is he going to get the Marine Division?
[00:48:58.706 --> 00:49:05.707]  They're all, they're all already exhausted in, in Afghanistan and some of them left in Iraq, so.
[00:49:06.287 --> 00:49:30.652]  You know, this all has a degree of unreality, and when I see Senator Kit Bond of Missouri and John Kyle talking about, we need regime change, we need regime change in Iran because there's such a threat to Israel, well, you know, that just reminds me of the old saw about, you know, when they offered to make Israel the 51st state of the United States, Israel refused.
[00:49:30.652 --> 00:49:31.872]  You know why, Alex?
[00:49:31.872 --> 00:49:33.653]  Well, now why?
[00:49:33.653 --> 00:49:35.633]  Because then they'd only have two senators.
[00:49:38.779 --> 00:49:43.401]  Oh man, you know, this is just insane.
[00:49:43.401 --> 00:49:45.141]  So what's the intel you're getting?
[00:49:45.141 --> 00:49:46.622]  Are they planning to hit Iran?
[00:49:46.622 --> 00:49:48.983]  Or are they just going to have sanctions?
[00:49:48.983 --> 00:49:50.443]  Where is this going?
[00:49:50.443 --> 00:49:53.084]  I think Netanyahu is chafing at the bit.
[00:49:54.736 --> 00:50:12.195]  And I think Obama is under great pressure from the Likud lobby and from those still in the White House who have great difficulty distinguishing between what they perceive to be the strategic interests of Israel on the one hand and those of the United States on the other.
[00:50:13.229 --> 00:50:16.270]  I hope, and that's what it is, a hope.
[00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:21.793]  It's just a little bit more than, a little less than an expectation that Obama will stand up to this.
[00:50:21.793 --> 00:50:24.133]  This would be a ruinous war.
[00:50:24.133 --> 00:50:28.275]  This would be worse than the way he contemplates doing in Afghanistan.
[00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:29.356]  This would be bedlam.
[00:50:29.356 --> 00:50:36.158]  And I think that as long as he listens to people like Mullen, that he'll be restrained.
[00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:38.219]  Final segment with Ray McGovern straight ahead.
[00:50:38.219 --> 00:50:42.581]  I want to get his take on the Russia situation, where he thinks Afghanistan's going.
[00:50:44.286 --> 00:50:46.288]  I just wish we could stop having all these wars.
[00:50:46.288 --> 00:50:49.012]  I mean, our government has overthrown Iran repeatedly.
[00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:52.356]  They're constantly meddling inside their nation.
[00:50:52.356 --> 00:50:54.999]  We've really done this country wrong, folks.
[00:50:54.999 --> 00:50:56.620]  And now they're saying they're gonna nuke us.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.463]  I mean, it's just pure bull.
[00:51:01.661 --> 00:51:11.563]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[00:51:11.563 --> 00:51:13.623]  If so, you are not alone.
[00:51:13.623 --> 00:51:17.224]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[00:51:17.224 --> 00:51:30.366]  If you'd like to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then this might be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:51:30.726 --> 00:51:31.546]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:07.076]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.076 --> 00:52:12.962]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:52:12.962 --> 00:52:19.109]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:19.429 --> 00:52:21.409]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:21.409 --> 00:52:23.870]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:37.052]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:52:37.052 --> 00:52:38.733]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.733 --> 00:52:40.593]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.593 --> 00:52:46.814]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:57.331]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.331 --> 00:52:58.533]  The people strike back!
[00:53:00.447 --> 00:53:04.952]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[00:53:04.952 --> 00:53:08.996]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[00:53:08.996 --> 00:53:20.067]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is handpicked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[00:53:20.067 --> 00:53:22.289]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful
[00:53:25.657 --> 00:53:26.338]  We're good to go.
[00:53:41.937 --> 00:53:42.758]  We're good to go.
[00:54:15.929 --> 00:54:26.058]  Ray McGovern is our guest, final segment.
[00:54:26.058 --> 00:54:28.220]  Ray, what about the rest of the world, geopolitically?
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:28.760]  What's going on?
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:36.948]  Well, what's going on is the rest of the world is looking at us and kind of shaking its head.
[00:54:36.948 --> 00:54:40.471]  The Russians and the Chinese and the Indians are the big players, of course.
[00:54:41.252 --> 00:54:50.077]  As they watch what we're trying to do in Afghanistan, you know, they're sort of shrugging their shoulders and saying, well, be our guest.
[00:54:50.077 --> 00:54:53.018]  You know, we all tried that in Afghanistan.
[00:54:53.018 --> 00:55:04.004]  We all failed going back to, you know, going back to the early end of the great, not to mention Chinggis Khan and the Persians and the Indians and the British and the Russians.
[00:55:04.004 --> 00:55:07.246]  Go ahead, you know, waste your military.
[00:55:07.987 --> 00:55:17.997]  And with respect to Iran, you know, the Russians used to care a great deal about what happened on their soft southern underbelly.
[00:55:17.997 --> 00:55:22.581]  But they seem almost cavalier with respect to Iranian plans.
[00:55:22.581 --> 00:55:30.369]  And I think part of that has to do with the fact that they don't have Israel as their, quote, ally, end quote.
[00:55:31.041 --> 00:55:32.643]  Now why do I use quotes?
[00:55:32.643 --> 00:55:38.949]  Well, because 99% of the American people believe that Israel is an ally of the United States.
[00:55:38.949 --> 00:55:40.311]  That's wrong.
[00:55:40.311 --> 00:55:42.473]  An alliance requires a treaty.
[00:55:42.473 --> 00:55:46.037]  There is no mutual defense treaty between the United States and Israel.
[00:55:46.576 --> 00:56:12.770]  The reason there is none is because treaties require internationally recognized boundaries, and Israel is in possession for over 60 years now, no, 60 years from 67 on till now, whatever the math is, of the occupied territories, West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, and Israel, the last thing it wants is to have any international body
[00:56:13.557 --> 00:56:16.419]  Uh, draw the borders back to where they used to be.
[00:56:16.419 --> 00:56:25.083]  So, there is no alliance and yet we proceed and the media characterizes our relationship with Israel as an alliance.
[00:56:25.083 --> 00:56:27.245]  Our policy makers treat it that way.
[00:56:27.245 --> 00:56:36.830]  But Russia, Russia sits back and laughs and says, well if they do something really idiotic, if they close the Straits of Hormuz, guess who benefits?
[00:56:38.035 --> 00:56:38.915]  Who benefits?
[00:56:38.915 --> 00:56:39.735]  Russia.
[00:56:39.735 --> 00:56:41.856]  Russia's got all the oil, you know?
[00:56:41.856 --> 00:56:49.638]  Man, at the price of oil, you know, we'll be able to have a villa, we'll have a dacha for each little worker in Russia.
[00:56:49.638 --> 00:56:55.939]  Is that why Russia met with Netanyahu secretly a month ago and has now said they support sanctions against Iran?
[00:56:55.939 --> 00:56:58.540]  Well, you know, Russia plays a very clever game.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:02.581]  You know, they express concern about this and then they go ahead.
[00:57:02.581 --> 00:57:03.721]  Now, with Netanyahu,
[00:57:05.317 --> 00:57:10.438]  They are restraining that influence, although they don't care as much as we do.
[00:57:10.438 --> 00:57:30.082]  So when Netanyahu goes up there, what you expect him to get is not approval for a strike on Iran, but some sort of reassurance that, for example, the Russians won't sell sophisticated missiles to defend the Iranian sites there, the enrichment sites.
[00:57:31.602 --> 00:57:40.091]  You know, last year Ehud Olmert went to Moscow and he was summoned there.
[00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:48.019]  The Russians warned him in similarly definitive terms, like Admiral Mullen, don't even think of attacking Iran.
[00:57:48.599 --> 00:57:59.162]  So the Russians have no real incentive for that kind of attack, but if it happens, they're going to be the big beneficiary by doubling the price of their oil.
[00:57:59.162 --> 00:58:01.882]  Got to cut you off, we're almost out of time in the last minute.
[00:58:01.882 --> 00:58:03.503]  Do you think it's sanctions or an attack?
[00:58:03.503 --> 00:58:08.244]  I mean, if you had to make a dead reckoning again, do you think they're going to hit Iran in the next year or two?
[00:58:09.191 --> 00:58:11.972]  Uh, gosh, uh, I don't know, Alex.
[00:58:11.972 --> 00:58:13.973]  It will depend on how this thing plays out.
[00:58:13.973 --> 00:58:29.379]  There will be sanctions first, uh, but, uh, there's great pressure for an attack, and I would not rule out the likelihood that Israel would be given a nod by somebody in the White House and go ahead and do it and force our hand.
[00:58:29.379 --> 00:58:31.700]  And then Iran will go absolutely wild.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:36.202]  Oh, yeah, it'll be bedlam, and we'll suffer great attrition for our own troops in the area.
[00:58:36.966 --> 00:58:38.769]  Ray McGovern, thank you for your time.
[00:58:38.769 --> 00:58:41.955]  You're most welcome.

[00:58:50.401 --> 00:58:54.642]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.642 --> 00:58:56.642]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.642 --> 00:59:05.164]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.164 --> 00:59:10.706]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.706 --> 00:59:12.326]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.586 --> 00:59:19.089]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.089 --> 00:59:30.154]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.154 --> 00:59:30.614]  That's right.
[00:59:30.894 --> 00:59:33.474]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.474 --> 00:59:37.635]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[00:59:37.635 --> 00:59:40.796]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[00:59:48.177 --> 00:59:53.378]  That's A Cola Blue dot com.
[00:59:53.378 --> 00:59:55.758]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:58.539]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.747 --> 01:00:06.067]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.067 --> 01:00:07.828]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.828 --> 01:00:09.588]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.588 --> 01:00:11.189]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.189 --> 01:00:12.729]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.729 --> 01:00:16.910]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:22.592]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.592 --> 01:00:25.693]  The new world order is coming in like a flood.
[01:00:25.693 --> 01:00:29.614]  All these years they said there was no world government being set up, now it's just admitted.
[01:00:30.891 --> 01:00:32.011]  They're testing the public.
[01:00:32.011 --> 01:00:33.052]  They're probing.
[01:00:33.052 --> 01:00:35.993]  Taking some more phone calls here.
[01:00:35.993 --> 01:00:37.874]  Good old Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo.
[01:00:37.874 --> 01:00:40.835]  We've got Mike Adams, the health ranger, coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:40.835 --> 01:00:41.875]  Annie in New York.
[01:00:41.875 --> 01:00:42.575]  You're on the air.
[01:00:42.575 --> 01:00:43.576]  Welcome.
[01:00:43.576 --> 01:00:44.796]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:00:44.796 --> 01:00:49.518]  I'm the sister of Claire, the daycare teacher, who works for Northeast Health.
[01:00:49.518 --> 01:00:52.419]  And we're going to that rally in Albany tomorrow.
[01:00:52.419 --> 01:00:55.840]  And as everything's on hold, I was printing out some stuff from your site.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.822]  You know, that the regular flu shot has H1N1 in it and some stuff from Dr. Horowitz.
[01:01:00.521 --> 01:01:06.584]  Um, we should probably expect that there are going to be feds there in one way or another, shouldn't we?
[01:01:06.584 --> 01:01:07.884]  Yeah, you're evil Americans.
[01:01:07.884 --> 01:01:16.048]  You're not allowed to go out and say, we don't want to take the forced flu shot that Obama says isn't forced, though they are forcing it on healthcare workers.
[01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:19.550]  Uh, again, that's un-American to go out and have free speech.
[01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:20.791]  How dare you?
[01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:21.511]  It's ridiculous.
[01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:28.094]  My sister is being ostracized by her boss, um, because, you know, she's been taken out of her regular classrooms.
[01:01:29.023 --> 01:01:32.765]  And given other duties, like she's some kind of pariah.
[01:01:32.765 --> 01:01:34.405]  I just feel so sorry for her.
[01:01:34.405 --> 01:01:36.766]  Alex, I mean, they're going to take down the web eventually.
[01:01:36.766 --> 01:01:47.871]  I wish that shortwave and CB retailers would advertise on your sites because possibly we could get your show then on shortwave, correct?
[01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:50.252]  Yes, I'm on shortwave.
[01:01:50.252 --> 01:01:51.893]  I wish they would advertise on your sites.
[01:01:51.893 --> 01:01:52.633]  And lastly, Alex,
[01:01:53.528 --> 01:02:00.218]  The camera has become mightier than the sword, as evidenced by the punishment Luke Rodarski got for making a fool of Brian Williams.
[01:02:00.218 --> 01:02:02.221]  God bless each and every one of you.
[01:02:02.221 --> 01:02:03.022]  God bless you.
[01:02:03.022 --> 01:02:07.128]  We'll bring this up to Mike Adams in the next segment, but closing out with the flu.
[01:02:09.699 --> 01:02:11.141]  Yeah, um, the news story about that today is
[01:02:31.334 --> 01:02:42.106]  The UK government has come out on the Downing Street website and said that the swine flu vaccine will not be mandatory and yet it's, as we've discussed before,
[01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:47.363]  Their private plans all revolve around it being a compulsory vaccination.
[01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:52.084]  Their preparation revolves around it being a compulsory vaccination.
[01:02:52.084 --> 01:02:55.885]  They're making health workers take it by mandate or they're fired.
[01:02:55.885 --> 01:03:07.288]  So while governments are publicly saying that it won't be mandatory, all their planning indicates that for large sectors of the population it will be.
[01:03:07.288 --> 01:03:08.008]  Absolutely.
[01:03:08.008 --> 01:03:10.289]  Kurt Nemo, your take on that?
[01:03:10.908 --> 01:03:13.210]  Well, I think that he's right.
[01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:22.759]  You know, in this country, they're starting with the healthcare workers and anybody who's in the public domain and trying to work down towards the general populace.
[01:03:22.759 --> 01:03:24.200]  I'm not sure they'll make it.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:30.326]  Yeah, because if they can force the healthcare enforcers to do it and the police to do it, then they'll make us do it.
[01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:32.850]  Yeah, we're going to have a hard time doing that, though.
[01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:35.733]  They've only got the next two months to do it.
[01:03:35.733 --> 01:03:42.099]  I think they're going to get enough people just through this pervasive propaganda campaign to go and get the vaccine.
[01:03:42.099 --> 01:03:47.484]  It's going to be difficult for them to come and tell me to get a vaccine at my neighbor's.
[01:03:47.484 --> 01:03:53.850]  Well, that's the next phase, shutting down roads, shutting down cities, making you have a bracelet or you don't get through.
[01:03:54.966 --> 01:04:02.929]  Well, yeah, if they can make this into a pandemic, you know, this H1N1, which is a total joke, they may be able to do that.
[01:04:02.929 --> 01:04:11.353]  Well, regardless, they are gauging the response of the people worldwide to this for future forced inoculation campaigns, or they could go
[01:04:12.353 --> 01:04:13.654]  Hot with the program right now.
[01:04:13.654 --> 01:04:18.196]  We'll talk about this with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, who now lives in Ecuador full-time.
[01:04:18.196 --> 01:04:20.578]  He also writes for, uh, Natural News.
[01:04:20.578 --> 01:04:22.018]  So, that is coming up.
[01:04:22.018 --> 01:04:31.404]  We'll continue to watch InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for all the piercing analysis of Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, Kurt Nemo, and Paul Watson.
[01:04:31.404 --> 01:04:33.925]  Gentlemen, I want to thank you both for joining us today.
[01:04:33.925 --> 01:04:34.866]  We need to get a story out.
[01:04:35.626 --> 01:04:40.389]  With the term hoax in it, dealing with Iran and this being a secret facility.
[01:04:40.389 --> 01:04:41.590]  Good job, man.
[01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:42.230]  Take care.
[01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:43.531]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:50.796]  Alright, more calls straight ahead from Lewis, Chris, Dan, Tanya, Maryann, and others.
[01:04:50.796 --> 01:04:52.617]  Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, straight ahead.
[01:04:52.617 --> 01:04:53.918]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:53.918 --> 01:04:56.559]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.821]  You can pre-order Fall of the Republic right now.
[01:05:00.376 --> 01:05:05.683]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.683 --> 01:05:10.209]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.209 --> 01:05:12.492]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.114]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.114 --> 01:05:15.156]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.376 --> 01:05:23.801]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:31.265]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:05:31.265 --> 01:05:37.308]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:42.891]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:05:43.311 --> 01:05:47.456]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:06:00.307 --> 01:06:03.688]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:06:03.688 --> 01:06:07.290]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:11.872]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.872 --> 01:06:17.474]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.754 --> 01:06:22.517]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.517 --> 01:06:26.160]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:30.963]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:30.963 --> 01:06:37.527]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:39.489]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:39.969 --> 01:06:43.170]  With a solar power generator from Solutions From Science.
[01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:47.671]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.831]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:06:49.831 --> 01:06:49.891]  877-327-0365.
[01:06:49.891 --> 01:06:51.211]  Don't wait, call today.
[01:06:51.211 --> 01:06:52.732]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:05.392]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[01:07:05.392 --> 01:07:07.194]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[01:07:07.194 --> 01:07:11.159]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[01:07:11.159 --> 01:07:15.704]  Beta Prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[01:07:15.704 --> 01:07:20.290]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.
[01:07:20.694 --> 01:07:26.156]  Beta Prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[01:07:26.156 --> 01:07:35.220]  And Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one Beta Prostate.
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.241]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[01:07:38.241 --> 01:07:39.942]  You only pay shipping and handling.
[01:07:39.942 --> 01:07:42.783]  To get your free bottle of Beta Prostate, call 1-800-360-8306.
[01:07:42.783 --> 01:07:43.003]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[01:07:48.505 --> 01:07:51.507]  This offer is for one free bottle per household.
[01:07:51.507 --> 01:07:54.370]  Call now and try Beta Prostate for free.
[01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:57.372]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[01:07:57.372 --> 01:08:01.935]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[01:08:01.935 --> 01:08:08.581]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.581 --> 01:08:11.543]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:19.977]  A lot of Americans, Europeans for that matter, are bugging out.
[01:08:19.977 --> 01:08:25.361]  They're going to New Zealand, they're going to the Cook Islands, they're going to the South Pacific, they're going to Costa Rica, they're going to Ecuador.
[01:08:25.361 --> 01:08:30.185]  You know, the Bushes have bought land in South America.
[01:08:30.185 --> 01:08:32.747]  Hundreds of thousands of acres of it.
[01:08:32.747 --> 01:08:37.651]  There are a lot of wealthy people here in Austin, a lot of wealthy business people that I've run into over the years.
[01:08:37.651 --> 01:08:39.453]  They tell me that a lot of the big money is left
[01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:42.701]  The last three years, there's been news articles about that.
[01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:59.694]  That's a side issue, but Mike Adams, the health ranger, founder of naturalnews.com, huge site, an online news source covering all areas of personal and planetary wellness, from nutrition to renewable energy, and he's written thousands of articles and built the following over 800,000 people across the globe.
[01:08:59.694 --> 01:09:00.975]  It's a lot more than that.
[01:09:00.975 --> 01:09:09.041]  Mike has also founded a non-profit organization, the Consumer Wellness Center, an online retail center, Better Life Goods, and popular publishing company, Truth Publishing.
[01:09:09.041 --> 01:09:10.082]  He now lives in Ecuador.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.301]  And he joins us for the rest of the hour.
[01:09:12.301 --> 01:09:15.302]  We're going to be opening the phones up on a host of issues.
[01:09:15.302 --> 01:09:21.185]  But Mike, you've certainly put your money where your mouth is down there trying to have real sustainability.
[01:09:21.185 --> 01:09:23.926]  Something the UN tries to create an evil clone of.
[01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.087]  Why did you move to Ecuador?
[01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:28.850]  Well, by the way, thanks for having me on the show, Alex.
[01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:31.332]  It's a great honor to be with you again today.
[01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:36.237]  But you're right, sustainability and putting my money where my mouth is.
[01:09:36.237 --> 01:09:41.261]  Right now, I'm living 80% off of my own food supply down here.
[01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:46.065]  And more importantly, I'm able to make sure that I can stay on the air.
[01:09:46.065 --> 01:09:47.927]  So if things happen in the U.S.
[01:09:47.927 --> 01:09:48.608]  with websites,
[01:09:49.128 --> 01:09:58.190]  I know that I can host websites in other countries and I can continue to help reach people from Ecuador without being, you know, taken away by U.S.
[01:09:58.190 --> 01:09:58.610]  authorities.
[01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:00.150]  So there are a lot of reasons I'm here.
[01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:01.290]  Those are a couple of them.
[01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:05.571]  What are you doing to keep from getting malaria?
[01:10:05.571 --> 01:10:06.411]  I'm not in the jungles.
[01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.392]  I'm actually in the high elevation Andes.
[01:10:08.392 --> 01:10:10.912]  It's the perfect climate year-round.
[01:10:10.912 --> 01:10:11.912]  Spring-like weather.
[01:10:11.912 --> 01:10:13.833]  You think you're in paradise here.
[01:10:15.309 --> 01:10:20.293]  It's really just crazy good weather and non-stop food production.
[01:10:20.293 --> 01:10:24.297]  You can feed a family of four on about half an acre here.
[01:10:24.297 --> 01:10:28.600]  Yeah, I've talked to filmmakers like the maker of Crude, big film that just came out.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.662]  It was 25 trips I think he said down there.
[01:10:30.662 --> 01:10:34.085]  And I've seen the videos you've shot and put on your YouTube channel.
[01:10:34.085 --> 01:10:37.047]  Really good people there.
[01:10:37.047 --> 01:10:38.749]  And so you're living in the high Andes.
[01:10:40.239 --> 01:10:41.340]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:44.501]  It's high enough to get rid of the mosquitoes and the hot weather.
[01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:57.067]  And like you hinted at the top of the hour there, Alex, there are a lot, a lot of Americans and Canadians and British and Australians who are coming here for many of the same reasons.
[01:10:57.067 --> 01:11:01.249]  They're concerned about the swine flu pandemic vaccine response.
[01:11:01.249 --> 01:11:03.930]  They're concerned about the global currency collapse that's coming.
[01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:06.511]  They're concerned about their freedoms and many of them are coming here.
[01:11:06.511 --> 01:11:07.732]  We have great neighbors here.
[01:11:08.212 --> 01:11:09.292]  What about kidnapping?
[01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:11.213]  I hear Ecuador's got a problem with that.
[01:11:11.213 --> 01:11:17.014]  Up in the north area, near Colombia, there is a kidnapping issue.
[01:11:17.014 --> 01:11:19.854]  But we have really good relationships with all the local people here.
[01:11:19.854 --> 01:11:23.075]  You know, I speak decent enough Spanish now to get by.
[01:11:23.075 --> 01:11:25.816]  And we're part of the community.
[01:11:25.816 --> 01:11:28.036]  We're valued members of this community.
[01:11:28.036 --> 01:11:29.457]  We're not loners here.
[01:11:29.457 --> 01:11:31.457]  So I don't have any concern about that.
[01:11:32.503 --> 01:11:35.206]  Well, yeah, that's the way it is, I guess, in Central and South America.
[01:11:35.206 --> 01:11:36.488]  The people are the salt of the earth.
[01:11:36.488 --> 01:11:47.401]  You've usually got a small criminal group feeding on them, but from just looking at places to send my family if I have to, the area of Ecuador you're in, separate from your research, does look like a pretty good area.
[01:11:47.401 --> 01:11:49.985]  Tell us about your facility, then I want to get into the flu.
[01:11:51.593 --> 01:11:52.153]  Okay, sure.
[01:11:52.153 --> 01:11:56.376]  Well, we have some acreage here, and we grow all kinds of food.
[01:11:56.376 --> 01:12:03.600]  We have 80 different types of food and superfruits, 75 different trees just on our own land here.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:14.746]  And we grow far more than we can eat, so we donate food to the local community to help people there, and to help create good relationships between myself, a foreigner, and the local people.
[01:12:15.466 --> 01:12:19.047]  And, like you said, these are really good people.
[01:12:19.047 --> 01:12:25.990]  And Alex, this society cannot collapse because they already live so close to the Earth.
[01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:27.670]  I mean, they can do without water.
[01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.291]  They can do without electricity.
[01:12:29.291 --> 01:12:32.952]  They don't have heating and cooling here because the temperature doesn't require it.
[01:12:32.952 --> 01:12:38.894]  If the whole world falls apart, there are certain places on this planet where people are going to be just almost business as usual.
[01:12:38.894 --> 01:12:40.355]  And this is one of those places.
[01:12:41.849 --> 01:12:43.030]  Amazing.
[01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.530]  The flu.
[01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:45.212]  You're watching this.
[01:12:45.212 --> 01:12:49.315]  You're actually down in the hemisphere where a lot of this cranked up.
[01:12:49.315 --> 01:12:51.617]  We've seen the flu chart from the CDC.
[01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.839]  They say it peaks in a week and a half.
[01:12:53.839 --> 01:12:57.122]  Very mild, but people are being forced to take the regular shot.
[01:12:57.122 --> 01:12:57.983]  They're being intimidated.
[01:12:57.983 --> 01:13:02.146]  They're now starting this week with the regular H1N1.
[01:13:02.146 --> 01:13:05.469]  We've got vaccine trial deaths with other similar vaccines in Europe.
[01:13:06.269 --> 01:13:12.874]  We have the very same vaccine makers like Bayer caught knowingly shipping out HIV filled shots with hepatitis.
[01:13:12.874 --> 01:13:18.939]  No one seems to point out why do we trust these people that they're deploying troops in major cities everywhere.
[01:13:18.939 --> 01:13:25.265]  They are savagely attacking peaceful protesters and even going on university campuses saying no one's allowed outside day or night.
[01:13:25.825 --> 01:13:27.507]  Alright, and I apologize in advance.
[01:13:27.507 --> 01:13:30.229]  If I do get disconnected, I'll call right back in.
[01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:33.912]  Because I am talking to you from southern Ecuador, and sometimes that happens.
[01:13:33.912 --> 01:13:34.273]  In any case...
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:14:04.844]  The number one thing that I think most Americans need to be aware of right now is that even if they never got the vaccine, and even if they never showed flu symptoms, they may already have antibodies for the swine flu.
[01:14:04.844 --> 01:14:09.446]  They may have already been exposed, and their immune system did its job.
[01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:14.928]  You know, the job that God meant our immune system to do, which is to overcome infectious disease.
[01:14:14.928 --> 01:14:18.969]  You may be walking around right now immune to swine flu.
[01:14:19.648 --> 01:14:32.712]  And yet, at the same time, these authorities want everybody to be injected anyway, regardless of your status, regardless of what the side effects might be, and without any long-term testing ever being done on any of these vaccines.
[01:14:32.712 --> 01:14:37.433]  So this vaccine, I agree with your previous guests over the last several weeks who have said,
[01:14:38.053 --> 01:14:43.257]  This vaccine is more dangerous than the pandemic, by far.
[01:14:43.257 --> 01:14:44.718]  Let me just interrupt briefly.
[01:14:44.718 --> 01:14:58.548]  Dr. Monteith made the point from the CDC's own numbers, upwards of 37% of Americans when they get tested who are healthy already have the antibodies for the H1N1, meaning that it's already massively in the public and a very weak virus.
[01:14:58.548 --> 01:15:04.272]  So why would they, and they still inoculate people who have the antibodies.
[01:15:04.272 --> 01:15:05.093]  Totally pointless.
[01:15:06.144 --> 01:15:07.646]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:07.646 --> 01:15:09.127]  Well, it comes down to this.
[01:15:09.127 --> 01:15:12.852]  They use taxpayer dollars to buy all these vaccines.
[01:15:12.852 --> 01:15:16.156]  And if they don't find a way to use them, they're going to look pretty darn stupid.
[01:15:16.156 --> 01:15:24.065]  So they are going to push this pandemic, regardless of the scientific basis for it, which is really no basis for vaccination at this point.
[01:15:24.805 --> 01:15:32.352]  And they're just going to make sure they use up all these vaccines, even if that means injecting babies and children and immune-compromised people.
[01:15:32.352 --> 01:15:37.196]  I mean, they're just going to use them up to justify the decision that they made to buy these vaccines.
[01:15:37.196 --> 01:15:39.498]  That's not medical policy.
[01:15:39.498 --> 01:15:40.179]  That's politics.
[01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:48.676]  Did you see the Reuters story two weeks ago where they said, oh, millions are going to die of heart attacks and strokes and autoimmune stuff.
[01:15:48.676 --> 01:15:51.999]  They're going to think it's after they take the shot, but it's impossible.
[01:15:51.999 --> 01:15:53.841]  The shot can't have a bad reaction.
[01:15:53.841 --> 01:16:04.811]  So they're getting everybody ready for the bad reaction, saying it's a conspiracy, it doesn't exist, when their own internal CDC memorandums that were released a month ago said, no, get ready for adverse effects.
[01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:10.444]  Yeah, this is what I call the preemptive hypnosis of the consumers.
[01:16:10.444 --> 01:16:18.349]  They're trying to feed people this line to make them ignore the side effects and discount them as being just coincidence.
[01:16:18.349 --> 01:16:20.771]  But we've got a plan to do something about this.
[01:16:20.771 --> 01:16:26.054]  We're going to have a website out there where people can post the side effects that they're experiencing.
[01:16:26.054 --> 01:16:28.115]  And we'll be announcing that within a few days.
[01:16:28.115 --> 01:16:30.337]  So we've got to get some of this on the record, Alex, because
[01:16:31.577 --> 01:16:35.299]  The whole medical industry is trying to whitewash this entire thing.
[01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:40.362]  They have full immunity, they take no responsibility, and they don't value human life.
[01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:42.263]  We'll talk about conflict of interest.
[01:16:42.263 --> 01:16:53.128]  I mean, they're the ones profiting from it, running the genocide, and then they preemptively say, if you get Guillain-Barré or you get any of these other diseases, or you die or get sick, it wasn't the vaccine preemptively.
[01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:55.683]  Right.
[01:16:55.683 --> 01:17:10.999]  And remember this, this is research that has come out of Canada just in the last few days, that people who get the regular seasonal flu shot may be at an increased risk of being harmed by the swine flu if they do get exposed to the swine flu.
[01:17:10.999 --> 01:17:16.245]  So now we've got a case where one vaccine is worsening potentially the pandemic
[01:17:17.483 --> 01:17:20.284]  And yet they're pushing both of these vaccines on everyone.
[01:17:20.284 --> 01:17:22.225]  Of course, I say don't take any of the vaccines.
[01:17:22.225 --> 01:17:24.465]  Just take care of your immune system and you're going to be fine.
[01:17:24.465 --> 01:17:34.128]  You know, it's anecdotal, but neighbor kids playing my yard, a bunch of them got a shot a week and a half ago.
[01:17:34.128 --> 01:17:37.729]  Now, two of the four neighbor kids are sick in bed the last week and a half.
[01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:39.570]  And their parents can't put two and two together.
[01:17:41.358 --> 01:17:42.539]  It's very common, Alex.
[01:17:42.539 --> 01:17:57.345]  If you look at many of the outbreaks of infectious disease over the last several decades, you'll find that many of the people who were infected, in some cases the vast majority, were in fact the very people who received the vaccination injections.
[01:17:57.345 --> 01:18:01.387]  I've called vaccines, Alex, the quackery of modern medicine.
[01:18:01.967 --> 01:18:04.590]  This is the one thing that they cannot give up.
[01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:15.802]  They can't tell the truth about vaccines because so much of Western medicine and pharmacology depends on this mythology that chemical intervention is the solution to your health problems.
[01:18:15.802 --> 01:18:17.444]  But it's not.
[01:18:17.444 --> 01:18:23.270]  It's just a collection of lies and we are seeing it now very clearly with this swine flu vaccine.
[01:18:25.077 --> 01:18:26.098]  Amazing.
[01:18:26.098 --> 01:18:26.558]  Continue.
[01:18:26.558 --> 01:18:35.266]  We're about to go to break, but with the talk of forced inoculations, trying to force medical workers to do it, while Obama says, don't worry, don't have to take it.
[01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:38.573]  Well, very clearly.
[01:18:38.573 --> 01:18:40.134]  We're getting lots of reports from people.
[01:18:40.134 --> 01:18:42.374]  You know, we get thousands of emails sometimes.
[01:18:42.374 --> 01:18:53.776]  And healthcare workers are complaining to us that they are being threatened, they're being intimidated, and they're losing their jobs now because of their refusals to get the swine flu vaccination.
[01:18:53.776 --> 01:18:55.636]  And this is happening all across America.
[01:18:55.636 --> 01:19:00.177]  So it is being made mandatory in several different ways, even though they don't admit it.
[01:19:00.177 --> 01:19:04.418]  Oh yeah, they're having a big protest in New York and New Jersey tomorrow, and it's now mainstream news.
[01:19:04.418 --> 01:19:05.198]  They're firing people.
[01:19:06.263 --> 01:19:07.244]  Oh yeah, they are.
[01:19:07.244 --> 01:19:08.665]  Yeah, they're just going to kick them right out.
[01:19:08.665 --> 01:19:12.007]  And the thing is, these nurses, they know what they're talking about.
[01:19:12.007 --> 01:19:25.457]  They can go to their bosses in the hospitals and they can present documentation that, you know, I'm a healthy person, I have high vitamin D levels, I don't have respiratory problems, I'm not susceptible to swine flu infection, and I'm healthy, but it doesn't matter.
[01:19:25.457 --> 01:19:28.019]  They say take the injection or take a hike.
[01:19:28.019 --> 01:19:29.700]  That's what they're being told right now, Alex.
[01:19:32.486 --> 01:19:36.289]  Meanwhile, the military propaganda arm is saying no one has to take it.
[01:19:36.289 --> 01:19:38.491]  Don't listen to the conspiracy theorist.
[01:19:38.491 --> 01:19:41.914]  Just take the shot or you're fired, but no one's making you.
[01:19:41.914 --> 01:19:43.575]  All psych warfare.
[01:19:43.575 --> 01:19:48.219]  I want to get the bottom line from Mike Adams, the health ranger, on what he believes is really going on here.
[01:19:48.219 --> 01:19:50.701]  A lot of scientists are saying this is man-made.
[01:19:50.701 --> 01:19:54.424]  They're saying they may release something else that's mutated that's more deadly.
[01:19:54.424 --> 01:19:59.228]  Why do we see such a massive buildup for something that looks so incredibly mild on the surface?
[01:19:59.228 --> 01:19:59.749]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.926 --> 01:20:07.249]  Hey everybody, this is Stephen Baldwin, and if your daily vitamin is in pill form, you're wasting a lot of your money.
[01:20:07.249 --> 01:20:10.411]  Put all that stuff away and call my friends at Choose for Health.

[01:20:53.824 --> 01:20:54.244]  Thanks!
[01:21:01.212 --> 01:21:03.234]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[01:21:03.234 --> 01:21:06.196]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[01:21:06.196 --> 01:21:08.738]  Certainly not in my 17 years in the industry.
[01:21:08.738 --> 01:21:11.160]  Nearly 100 banks have been shuttered this year.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:14.342]  As many as 200 more banks are suspect by year's end.
[01:21:14.342 --> 01:21:16.784]  The FDIC is operating in the red.
[01:21:16.784 --> 01:21:17.865]  Who pays for that?
[01:21:17.865 --> 01:21:19.046]  Is your money safe?
[01:21:19.046 --> 01:21:23.109]  The dollar has lost over 95% of its value in the last 60 years.
[01:21:23.109 --> 01:21:26.471]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[01:21:26.471 --> 01:21:27.752]  Ours is not immune.
[01:21:27.752 --> 01:21:29.934]  The time is now to be proactive.
[01:21:29.934 --> 01:21:31.135]  Anything tied to the dollar is
[01:21:31.155 --> 01:21:32.435]  Call 1-800-686-2237 Extension 116
[01:22:01.013 --> 01:22:06.837]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:06.837 --> 01:22:14.421]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:22:14.421 --> 01:22:20.585]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:21.005 --> 01:22:22.966]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:22.966 --> 01:22:25.467]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:25.467 --> 01:22:37.051]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.051 --> 01:22:38.731]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.731 --> 01:22:40.592]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.592 --> 01:22:46.794]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.481 --> 01:22:55.750]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:57.331]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.331 --> 01:22:58.533]  The people strike back!
[01:23:00.569 --> 01:23:08.091]  Friends, this is Big Jim Farmer urging you to go to ejseed.com and purchase the Big Seed Bank.

[01:23:25.094 --> 01:23:26.154]  And the best part?
[01:23:26.154 --> 01:23:30.435]  You'll receive thousands of seeds that you can save and replant each
[01:23:30.535 --> 01:23:31.115]  We're good to go!
[01:24:04.199 --> 01:24:08.421]  You look like an angel.
[01:24:08.421 --> 01:24:12.363]  Walk like an angel.
[01:24:12.363 --> 01:24:14.944]  Talk like an angel.
[01:24:14.944 --> 01:24:18.706]  But I got wise.
[01:24:18.706 --> 01:24:21.688]  You're the devil in disguise.
[01:24:21.688 --> 01:24:23.248]  Oh yes you are.
[01:24:23.248 --> 01:24:26.110]  You know, Mike Adams, health ranger, joining us from Ecuador.
[01:24:27.995 --> 01:24:29.596]  It's not even the devil in disguise.
[01:24:29.596 --> 01:24:34.598]  I mean the history of vaccines, the history of these drug makers, the history of how they're involved in eugenics.
[01:24:34.598 --> 01:24:38.840]  Not 50 years ago, I mean they were, but 5 years ago, a year ago.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:44.703]  How they kill us on purpose, how they do this by design, how we're in this scientific big pharma dictatorship.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:47.861]  It's just incredible.
[01:24:47.861 --> 01:25:09.188]  You go over the 10 big lies of the vaccine, but before we go into that and take calls in the next segment, from your deep study of this, and I really respect your wide-ranging view and research on this, and you're probably the biggest alternative media person when it comes to just alternative health, and all the experts you talk to, what is this whole flu hype really about?
[01:25:10.526 --> 01:25:23.716]  Well, thanks for asking me that question, by the way, because there's a lot of information that comes to me that I really don't... I can't substantiate well enough to publish, but it comes to me from several different sources, so it starts to paint a picture.
[01:25:23.716 --> 01:25:38.828]  For example, I had a physician visiting me here in Ecuador recently, and this physician was telling me about the training that they had just received for how to handle people who were refusing to swine flu vaccinations.
[01:25:38.828 --> 01:25:40.029]  And this is...
[01:25:40.928 --> 01:25:59.242]  Totally, completely congruent with the reports we're getting from certain law enforcement personnel, sheriffs especially, who are saying that they're receiving either training or instruction on how to deal with swine flu vaccine checkpoints and the so-called refuse nicks, people who refuse the vaccine.
[01:25:59.242 --> 01:26:06.467]  And that's in the Level 6 literature globally and a lot of the info we were getting 2-3 weeks ago is now being confirmed, so this is going on.
[01:26:07.657 --> 01:26:08.598]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:08.598 --> 01:26:11.820]  And I've heard it first hand from people that I know and trust.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:13.761]  It's not just random bloggers emailing me.
[01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:16.723]  These are people I've known for many years.
[01:26:16.723 --> 01:26:20.046]  There's an undercurrent that is definitely happening.
[01:26:20.046 --> 01:26:31.233]  Now, I can't say if it's a plan to make these things happen or if it's just a contingency plan in case this pandemic gets out of control.
[01:26:31.233 --> 01:26:35.056]  Or if it's a drill to test military and police to see if they'll do it.
[01:26:36.234 --> 01:26:38.116]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[01:26:38.116 --> 01:26:40.938]  There's definitely an element of that going on.
[01:26:40.938 --> 01:26:51.466]  I think, Alex, I think that these people are listening to your show, they're reading my website, they're watching what the physicians and the nurses and the healthcare professionals actually do.
[01:26:51.466 --> 01:26:53.507]  Oh no, they've written about that.
[01:26:53.507 --> 01:26:56.750]  Fox News, others have written about this show particularly.
[01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:57.871]  I've seen you singled out.
[01:26:57.871 --> 01:26:59.612]  No, they admit they're monitoring us right now.
[01:27:00.771 --> 01:27:07.253]  Oh yeah, it's all part of the same plan to make sure that they can properly manipulate the population.
[01:27:07.253 --> 01:27:16.375]  And that's why you get into that story that you mentioned before the break about the preemptive hypnosis of people to discount the swine flu vaccine side effects.
[01:27:16.375 --> 01:27:18.215]  But if you ask me what the underlying
[01:27:21.266 --> 01:27:21.586]  I'm good.
[01:27:33.570 --> 01:27:45.018]  Because if you vaccinate everybody, you're going to get down the road a certain percentage of people with liver problems, with neurological problems especially, and of course, immune system problems.
[01:27:45.018 --> 01:27:54.024]  And this means future business for the cancer industry, future business for the transplant industry, which is steeped in all kinds of evil doing that we can't even go into.
[01:27:54.024 --> 01:27:56.686]  But you see where I'm going with this, Alex?
[01:27:56.686 --> 01:27:58.187]  This creates a lot of business.
[01:27:59.022 --> 01:28:00.985]  And it's all about money.
[01:28:00.985 --> 01:28:06.953]  But the second possibility here is about population control.
[01:28:06.953 --> 01:28:10.278]  And if you look at the chemicals that are being put into these vaccines,
[01:28:10.871 --> 01:28:13.133]  You know, the squalene in particular.
[01:28:13.133 --> 01:28:17.776]  This is a chemical that is associated with increased infertility.
[01:28:17.776 --> 01:28:22.700]  And what a brilliant, clever, evil way to cause widespread infertility.
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.622]  Just get everybody to sign up for an injection.
[01:28:25.622 --> 01:28:30.626]  And frying immune systems.
[01:28:30.626 --> 01:28:31.927]  Absolutely.
[01:28:31.927 --> 01:28:38.792]  I think that the medical complex in this country wants to keep people immune-compromised
[01:28:39.486 --> 01:28:43.107]  And completely ignorant of medical reality.
[01:28:43.107 --> 01:28:50.949]  They don't want people to know about natural cures, for example, or all the cures for cancer that exist right now all around the world.
[01:28:50.949 --> 01:28:54.270]  I've got cures for cancer growing in my front yard here in Ecuador.
[01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:56.310]  They're all over South America.
[01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:59.051]  And North Americans haven't heard of many of these.
[01:28:59.051 --> 01:29:06.293]  But they exist, and they're being censored and oppressed because the people in charge want to keep the American people ignorant.
[01:29:08.345 --> 01:29:09.285]  Well, I agree with that.
[01:29:09.285 --> 01:29:17.249]  It's also about reinforcing the lie that you've got to take vaccines, setting the precedent that you've got to take vaccines.
[01:29:17.249 --> 01:29:19.010]  It's also, as you said, a soft kill weapon.
[01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:25.913]  Like, look at how they've increased the vaccinations for hepatitis, then suddenly levels of hepatitis explode off the charts.
[01:29:25.913 --> 01:29:27.334]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[01:29:27.774 --> 01:29:30.816]  On the other side with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:30.816 --> 01:29:32.377]  Your phone calls as well at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:32.377 --> 01:29:37.139]  I realize a lot of your calls will be all over the map.
[01:29:37.139 --> 01:29:38.120]  We'll move to you quickly.
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:43.783]  But if you have questions on the flu or questions about medical issues, Mike Adams is a real authority.
[01:29:43.783 --> 01:29:45.184]  We really are honored to have him here.
[01:29:45.184 --> 01:29:51.027]  He's a great asset to Liberty and Freedom.
[01:29:51.027 --> 01:29:52.428]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.428 --> 01:29:53.929]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.950 --> 01:30:01.193]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.193 --> 01:30:04.215]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.215 --> 01:30:09.538]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.538 --> 01:30:11.579]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.579 --> 01:30:16.581]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.581 --> 01:30:17.502]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.762 --> 01:30:18.883]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.883 --> 01:30:20.765]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.765 --> 01:30:21.845]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.845 --> 01:30:24.047]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.047 --> 01:30:25.388]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.388 --> 01:30:26.910]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:32.174]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.174 --> 01:30:35.777]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.777 --> 01:30:39.240]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:40.802]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:41.703]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.703 --> 01:30:42.804]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:43.745]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.745 --> 01:30:44.846]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.846 --> 01:30:47.890]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.890 --> 01:30:49.672]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.672 --> 01:30:50.593]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.273 --> 01:31:05.580]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.106]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.106 --> 01:31:12.389]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.389 --> 01:31:14.011]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:14.011 --> 01:31:15.053]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.273 --> 01:31:23.699]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.699 --> 01:31:31.164]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:31:31.164 --> 01:31:36.828]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:31:37.188 --> 01:31:43.209]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.209 --> 01:31:47.350]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:54.812]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[01:31:54.812 --> 01:31:58.113]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:32:01.411 --> 01:32:06.572]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[01:32:06.572 --> 01:32:10.073]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[01:32:10.073 --> 01:32:15.794]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[01:32:15.794 --> 01:32:18.354]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[01:32:18.354 --> 01:32:22.895]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[01:32:22.895 --> 01:32:25.616]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[01:32:26.076 --> 01:32:31.804]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[01:32:31.804 --> 01:32:34.067]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:34.067 --> 01:32:42.638]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[01:32:42.638 --> 01:32:43.640]  Don't pick your nose.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.561]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[01:32:48.561 --> 01:32:53.683]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[01:32:53.683 --> 01:32:55.423]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[01:32:55.423 --> 01:32:57.644]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:57.644 --> 01:32:59.364]  Be well and stay well.
[01:32:59.364 --> 01:33:11.207]  Best MZ.
[01:33:11.207 --> 01:33:12.968]  We're here live, Monday through Friday.
[01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:15.709]  12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:16.049]  Eastern.
[01:33:16.049 --> 01:33:18.250]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:21.310]  This show is not about races or religions fighting with each other.
[01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:25.291]  It's not about bashing any one group.
[01:33:25.291 --> 01:33:34.533]  It's about waking up to the scientific dictatorship we live under and warning the people and saying no as free sentient beings on this planet.
[01:33:34.533 --> 01:33:38.054]  And if we don't shatter the false left-right paradigm, it's over for this society.
[01:33:38.054 --> 01:33:39.734]  Going back to Mike Adams in a moment.
[01:33:40.803 --> 01:33:45.051]  Uh, where he can give us his take on the flu vaccine, other key information.
[01:33:45.726 --> 01:33:47.647]  We're also going to be taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:47.647 --> 01:33:56.392]  I know many of these callers have been holding since before he was on with us, but he can speak to any issue in his wide-ranging understanding.
[01:33:56.392 --> 01:34:10.780]  We'll also put on screen for people photos taken by one of our listeners of a National Guard with Border Patrol deep inside a state, and they asked him if he'd had his flu shot, started asking if he had a bracelet, and people were honking and they waved him on through.
[01:34:11.926 --> 01:34:16.968]  California Swine Flu Checkpoint Identified, ladies and gentlemen, is the headline at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:16.968 --> 01:34:21.749]  Before we go back to my guest, I want to tell you about one of our sponsors that makes this hour possible.
[01:34:21.749 --> 01:34:23.369]  That's FrontSight.
[01:34:23.369 --> 01:34:25.010]  FrontSight Firearms.
[01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:26.690]  FrontSight.com.
[01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:31.252]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder of the FrontSight Firearms Training Institute?
[01:34:31.252 --> 01:34:34.813]  He's offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[01:34:35.663 --> 01:34:42.125]  The offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piaget is literally paying his own money out of pocket to be able to offer you this deal and won't last forever.
[01:34:42.125 --> 01:34:43.006]  So listen up.
[01:34:43.006 --> 01:34:50.688]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:34:50.688 --> 01:34:56.070]  Act fast, you will be given a free spring-filled Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:59.972]  It's one thing to own a bunch of guns and ammo to defend yourself from criminals and
[01:35:00.812 --> 01:35:04.255]  Other groups, but it's one another thing to actually be trained.
[01:35:04.255 --> 01:35:05.596]  No drill instructor attitude.
[01:35:05.596 --> 01:35:06.436]  It's awesome.
[01:35:06.436 --> 01:35:07.577]  Frontsight.com.
[01:35:07.577 --> 01:35:10.479]  That's Frontsight.com.
[01:35:10.479 --> 01:35:14.082]  And one last sponsor I want to tell you about is MySolarBackup.com.
[01:35:14.082 --> 01:35:15.703]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:35:15.703 --> 01:35:16.964]  Hurricane, snow, ice storms.
[01:35:18.536 --> 01:35:20.417]  Global greenhouse taxes, you name it.
[01:35:20.417 --> 01:35:23.458]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a way to do just that.
[01:35:23.458 --> 01:35:27.600]  The solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:35.043]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the power source, 800-watt generator, and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:35:35.043 --> 01:35:38.765]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas.
[01:35:39.065 --> 01:35:40.547]  Because they run on electricity.
[01:35:40.547 --> 01:35:43.209]  It's a perfect emergency backup for these troubled times.
[01:35:43.209 --> 01:35:45.992]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[01:35:45.992 --> 01:35:47.094]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:35:47.094 --> 01:35:47.894]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:35:47.894 --> 01:35:52.039]  And I won't belabor this anymore, but I will just tell you, the listeners, that my new film is done.
[01:36:02.503 --> 01:36:06.069]  We sent Cruz out 17 times around the country for these interviews.
[01:36:06.069 --> 01:36:08.633]  Alan Watts in it, just to give you an idea.
[01:36:08.633 --> 01:36:09.234]  Went to Canada.
[01:36:11.343 --> 01:36:20.165]  It covers the entire master plan, how the banks carried it out, what the new world order is, how they're using television to put people into a hypnotic state, and it's volume one.

[01:36:47.578 --> 01:36:52.580]  Going back to Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com, the health ranger.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:56.662]  He also runs Better Life Foods and Truth Publishing.
[01:36:56.662 --> 01:36:58.323]  And again, NaturalNews.com.
[01:36:58.323 --> 01:36:59.384]  I want to go to calls.
[01:36:59.684 --> 01:37:02.588]  But before we do that, Mike, again, you've got the floor.
[01:37:02.588 --> 01:37:07.454]  You keep pausing for me to jump in, and that's a great opportunity for me, but I'm trying to break my habit of interrupting.
[01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:13.222]  What is most important people should know about the regular shot and the H1N1?
[01:37:13.222 --> 01:37:17.808]  Where do you see all this going, and what can we do to get the word out to say no to this?
[01:37:19.566 --> 01:37:29.598]  Yeah, the most important thing people need to know right now is that if they're considering a vaccine, maybe they're trying to weigh the potential upside and the potential downside.
[01:37:29.598 --> 01:37:35.144]  They might be doing that from a point of view of believing that they have been told both sides of the story.
[01:37:35.664 --> 01:37:53.784]  What they need to know is that these drug companies, and Merck in particular, I just wrote an article about Merck today, has a well-documented history of engaging in the intimidation of doctors and researchers who disagree with the safety of the company's products.
[01:37:53.784 --> 01:37:57.087]  So the question that I asked in today's article, in fact, was
[01:37:57.868 --> 01:38:05.352]  Are doctors and researchers and healthcare workers being intimidated about speaking out against the safety of the vaccines?
[01:38:05.352 --> 01:38:07.373]  Because I think that's what's going on.
[01:38:07.373 --> 01:38:15.678]  In fact, I'm sure of it, Alex, that people need to know that they aren't being given both sides of the story, that these vaccines are not safe, and that, in fact,
[01:38:16.198 --> 01:38:21.042]  They weren't even approved under a system of, quote, scientific medicine.
[01:38:21.042 --> 01:38:27.667]  They were approved under a medical dogma, a medical tyranny that operates in this country today.
[01:38:27.667 --> 01:38:31.150]  Under emergency, under level 6, under level 6 flu pandemic.
[01:38:31.150 --> 01:38:33.332]  Emergency, they did it.
[01:38:33.332 --> 01:38:34.292]  Absolutely.
[01:38:34.292 --> 01:38:35.974]  This isn't scientific.
[01:38:35.974 --> 01:38:37.935]  This vaccine isn't based on science.
[01:38:37.935 --> 01:38:42.038]  It's based on profits and politics and control.
[01:38:42.038 --> 01:38:45.241]  It has nothing to do with medical justification, period.
[01:38:47.034 --> 01:38:48.895]  Mike, you brought up Merck, interrupting here.
[01:38:48.895 --> 01:38:50.555]  You brought up Merck.
[01:38:50.555 --> 01:38:53.556]  It was in the ABC News Australia headline.
[01:38:53.556 --> 01:38:59.158]  Merck drew up hit list of doctors with, quote, seek and destroy missions, quote, going to where they live.
[01:38:59.158 --> 01:39:02.720]  And then Merck said, we just mean we go after them, not that we kill them.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.041]  But a lot of people in the federal court said, no, we believe this is hit teams.
[01:39:06.041 --> 01:39:06.341]  Go ahead.
[01:39:07.318 --> 01:39:09.019]  Well, yeah, they used those exact terms.
[01:39:09.019 --> 01:39:11.361]  They said we were going to, quote, neutralize doctors.
[01:39:11.361 --> 01:39:19.886]  There was another email from a Merck employee that surfaced in this Australian court case where they said, quote, we're going to go after them where they live.
[01:39:19.886 --> 01:39:23.149]  We're going to interfere with the funding of academic institutions.
[01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:29.613]  We're going to essentially target and destroy any person or organization that speaks out against our drugs.
[01:39:29.613 --> 01:39:35.957]  This is a drug company whose vaccines have been approved by the FDA to be injected into your babies.
[01:39:35.957 --> 01:39:37.118]  I mean, think about that.
[01:39:38.903 --> 01:39:42.794]  And they brought us Gardasil, they brought us Gardasil, they brought us Vioxx.
[01:39:42.794 --> 01:39:43.877]  Remind folks about that.
[01:39:45.094 --> 01:39:47.476]  Yeah, well, Gardasil, it's the same story.
[01:39:47.476 --> 01:39:52.920]  In fact, I think the Gardasil propaganda was a trial run for this pandemic propaganda.
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:40:07.873]  Gardasil, they've managed to get more than half of all teenage girls in America injected with this Gardasil vaccine, which is, once again, medically unjustified, in my view, and in the view of many, many other well-educated medical professionals.
[01:40:07.873 --> 01:40:10.275]  But this vaccine has been linked with all kinds of problems.
[01:40:11.796 --> 01:40:13.577]  People passing out with death.
[01:40:13.577 --> 01:40:15.178]  Deaths have been linked with this.
[01:40:15.178 --> 01:40:17.359]  Neurological problems have been linked with it.
[01:40:17.359 --> 01:40:20.161]  But it's the same story as with the swine flu vaccine.
[01:40:20.161 --> 01:40:25.944]  They say, couldn't be us, couldn't be the vaccine, don't blame us, it must be something else.
[01:40:25.944 --> 01:40:29.966]  It's always this disavowing of responsibility.
[01:40:29.966 --> 01:40:34.768]  Well, these are new type of genetically engineered hybrid viruses.
[01:40:34.768 --> 01:40:39.111]  They admitted in their own insert during the trials three years ago, as you know, but recapping for people.
[01:40:40.037 --> 01:40:44.460]  That it was causing autoimmune disorders, that there were deaths linked to it in the trials.
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:52.646]  Now the deaths are mounting, and healthy 13-14 year old girls take it and their lives are over, they die, they get paralyzed.
[01:40:52.646 --> 01:41:03.234]  And we know that Merck went to Governor Rick Perry to get him to quote make it mandatory, or on the list of mandatory shots to be in school, so that vaccine damage fund federally would kick in.
[01:41:03.234 --> 01:41:07.437]  This is one cold-blooded plan that they're engaged in.
[01:41:08.618 --> 01:41:17.742]  This is a very powerful corporation with a lot of strong political ties, including with Governor Rick Perry there in Texas, but many other ties at the national level.
[01:41:17.742 --> 01:41:28.786]  I mean, this company rules the medical world, and my concern with that, Alex, is that they're doing so purely based on profit and politics and not based on science.
[01:41:28.786 --> 01:41:33.968]  I mean, the scientific method has been thrown out the window when it comes to these vaccines.
[01:41:35.248 --> 01:41:46.494]  This whole germ theory has been turned on its head and used, exploited, as a way to dominate the health beliefs of the American citizens.
[01:41:46.494 --> 01:41:51.316]  Now people don't realize that they need to take responsibility for their own health.
[01:41:51.316 --> 01:41:52.657]  They need to eat better.
[01:41:52.657 --> 01:42:00.200]  They need to get some sunshine and vitamin D. They need to stop using so many chemicals in personal care products.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:01.281]  If they do those things,
[01:42:01.882 --> 01:42:06.462]  They're going to be well protected against this pandemic or any pandemic, really.
[01:42:07.384 --> 01:42:07.744]  Absolutely.
[01:42:07.744 --> 01:42:11.185]  But the medical system wants chemical intervention.
[01:42:11.185 --> 01:42:12.745]  That's what they keep driving at.
[01:42:12.745 --> 01:42:19.626]  Well, now the medical system is telling doctors, don't tell people there's any protection with Tamiflu or H1N1 shot.
[01:42:19.626 --> 01:42:25.868]  Don't tell people you need natural vitamin D from the sun, 30 minutes of sun every few days, direct sun.
[01:42:25.868 --> 01:42:30.009]  Don't tell people vitamin C. Don't tell people fish oil.
[01:42:30.009 --> 01:42:34.449]  Don't tell people colloidal silver compounds, even though the studies show it's excellent.
[01:42:34.449 --> 01:42:37.070]  They're saying you're now not allowed to tell people.
[01:42:38.382 --> 01:42:39.042]  Well, exactly.
[01:42:39.042 --> 01:42:44.285]  This is the enforced health illiteracy of the American people.
[01:42:44.285 --> 01:42:51.189]  I mean, really, I almost hate to invoke this imagery, but it goes back to the enslavement of people in America.
[01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:54.410]  And how do you keep people enslaved is you keep them illiterate.
[01:42:54.410 --> 01:42:56.091]  And that's what the FDA is doing.
[01:42:56.091 --> 01:43:03.275]  That's what the FTC is doing with the way that they attack and go after these companies that try to tell the truth online.
[01:43:03.715 --> 01:43:03.955]  I think?
[01:43:19.355 --> 01:43:25.219]  The things he told me, I would have thought he was being oppressed in Nazi Germany.
[01:43:25.219 --> 01:43:35.906]  But no, he came from the United States of America, barely got out of the country with his life, with his freedom, and now he refuses to go back because he's selling natural products.
[01:43:36.286 --> 01:43:53.634]  Well, the people perish for lack of knowledge, and certainly there's a lot of quacks out there, but there's more quackery in the major MD medical system, the drug companies taking over medicine, even getting rid of classical western medicine and bringing in this pharmakia medicine.
[01:43:56.789 --> 01:44:01.152]  I've talked to a lot of other medical doctors and they say that the tyranny is really expanding.
[01:44:01.152 --> 01:44:11.620]  When you can't tell people, get lots of rest and sunshine, when the CDC says only drugs, only shots, it's just such a crime.
[01:44:13.072 --> 01:44:18.778]  Yeah, and there are very few companies and individuals are willing to stand up to the FTC.
[01:44:18.778 --> 01:44:34.715]  There's one company, it's actually a church organization, Daniel Chapter One, and I've written about them extensively, and I know you've spoken with them, but they are standing up to the FTC and pulling the bluff of these federal tyrants that are trying to censor
[01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:36.990]  Yeah, they'll be all over the map.
[01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:38.731]  Lewis in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:44:38.731 --> 01:44:39.031]  Go ahead.
[01:44:39.031 --> 01:44:39.971]  Can you hear me good?
[01:45:05.441 --> 01:45:07.163]  Yes, I can.
[01:45:07.163 --> 01:45:11.406]  Uh, yeah, I got three quick points and a question for the doctor.
[01:45:11.406 --> 01:45:14.309]  He's not a doctor, he's a health researcher.
[01:45:14.309 --> 01:45:15.930]  Oh, okay, yeah, right.
[01:45:15.930 --> 01:45:26.340]  Well, uh, you know, I was alive during the Vietnam War and a good portion of the resistance came from the university.
[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:31.925]  And I mean, this thing that we witness over here at the G20, I mean, that ought to pop anybody's cork, you know?
[01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:46.583]  A lot of people are saying, how do we let the police come up and even go into dorms and attack people and shoot kids on their front porches playing ball or in their front yards with sound cannons.
[01:45:46.583 --> 01:45:47.664]  This is just outrageous.
[01:45:47.664 --> 01:45:48.865]  Go ahead.
[01:45:48.865 --> 01:45:56.871]  Well, I'll tell you what I'm calling for is nationwide, even worldwide, demonstrations on all the college campuses.
[01:45:57.898 --> 01:46:06.003]  You know, against this New World Order, against, you know, especially here, you know, against the free, you know, they're trying to give us these free speed zones and all this stuff.
[01:46:06.003 --> 01:46:12.286]  I mean, you don't want to get out there and get yourself killed like Kent State, but I mean, you know, I mean, there's things that we can do.
[01:46:12.286 --> 01:46:13.407]  You know, we've got to stand up.
[01:46:13.407 --> 01:46:23.653]  I mean, these students, I mean, if I was a student in another university and I saw what they did to those guys over at Pittsburgh there, I'd be like, man, you know, how fast can I get in these people's faces, you know?
[01:46:24.033 --> 01:46:32.901]  We'll see what's happening is, if they set the precedent to be able to beat people up, use police dogs on old women in neighborhoods, then they can shill free speech.
[01:46:32.901 --> 01:46:34.382]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:46:34.382 --> 01:46:37.264]  Telling people, if you protest, you'll be put on a terror list.
[01:46:37.264 --> 01:46:40.187]  They are the terrorists, the secret police terrorists doing that.
[01:46:40.187 --> 01:46:46.953]  And because they know that the changes to the dollar, the changes to our way of life, the tyranny, people are going to rebel.
[01:46:46.953 --> 01:46:49.855]  So they're trying to cow us and make us submit.
[01:46:49.855 --> 01:46:51.577]  Right now, these are psyops.
[01:46:52.296 --> 01:46:59.919]  But more importantly than just protesting, and I think that's important, is calling into talk radio, starting websites, starting flyering campaigns.
[01:46:59.919 --> 01:47:03.881]  Because they can't stop you coming out of the middle of nowhere putting up flyers with different issues.
[01:47:03.881 --> 01:47:06.462]  That's what our Joker poster contest was about.
[01:47:06.462 --> 01:47:09.304]  And I'm gonna announce the new contest tomorrow, I promise, the Loomis one.
[01:47:09.304 --> 01:47:13.405]  I've just been so far behind, got behind with Fall of the Republic, but I'm gonna do that tomorrow.
[01:47:13.405 --> 01:47:18.588]  The issue here is that we've done this to show people the power of just getting active.
[01:47:18.588 --> 01:47:20.028]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:20.028 --> 01:47:21.449]  What are other things we can do
[01:47:22.276 --> 01:47:34.956]  Rick, Mike Adams in your point to really rattle the cage of the establishment and have the people's voice be heard or should or do you see my point about what will happen if we just let this chilling effect take place?
[01:47:35.979 --> 01:47:37.040]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:42.725]  The ruling class right now is ruling by fear and intimidation.
[01:47:42.725 --> 01:47:44.126]  More and more people are waking up.
[01:47:44.126 --> 01:47:46.789]  I want to point this out about the vaccine.
[01:47:46.789 --> 01:47:52.914]  A recent poll showed that 60% of parents are refusing to give their children the vaccine.
[01:47:52.914 --> 01:47:54.956]  That's a huge statistic, Alex.
[01:47:54.956 --> 01:47:59.200]  That means that people like you and I are winning this information campaign.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:12.165]  Against all the multi-million dollars worth of public relations and advertising and promotional pushes by the drug companies, more than half of the parents still won't vaccinate their children against swine flu.
[01:48:12.165 --> 01:48:18.187]  That's a victory, and we need more victories like that, because the truth will prevail here.
[01:48:18.187 --> 01:48:24.850]  All we gotta do is keep on getting the truth out there, help to awaken other people around us, turn them on to the truth,
[01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:31.454]  And we will ultimately be victorious in this, I believe, but it's going to be a difficult process.
[01:48:31.454 --> 01:48:34.095]  And by the way, now is the time.
[01:48:34.095 --> 01:48:40.499]  As the tyranny comes in, as everything we talked about beforehand unfolds, we have amazing credibility right now.
[01:48:40.499 --> 01:48:46.863]  We've got to reach out to everybody and speak out now because we can wake people up 10 years ago, but not in these numbers.
[01:48:46.863 --> 01:48:48.944]  People are ready to hear the truth.
[01:48:48.944 --> 01:48:49.965]  The establishment there
[01:48:50.626 --> 01:48:53.678]  Is there trying to lead them around into more tyranny right now?
[01:48:53.678 --> 01:48:55.906]  We've got to be there to say no, there's an alternative.
[01:48:57.338 --> 01:48:58.539]  I think that's exactly right.
[01:48:58.539 --> 01:49:00.660]  You know, the American people are smart people.
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:03.921]  They can figure it out if they have access to the right information.
[01:49:03.921 --> 01:49:09.104]  Now, the people in power are trying to keep the Americans blind.
[01:49:09.104 --> 01:49:17.288]  But, fortunately, websites like yours, Prison Planet, and many others out there, and the information that you are getting out there, this is working.
[01:49:17.288 --> 01:49:20.350]  So keep doing it.
[01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:22.331]  Thank goodness for what you're doing there, Alex.
[01:49:23.652 --> 01:49:25.974]  Well, we're going to go to Bright and come back and take some final calls.
[01:49:25.974 --> 01:49:27.075]  Thank God for what you're doing.
[01:49:27.075 --> 01:49:31.998]  Your sites are rivaling ours in size, which excites me.
[01:49:31.998 --> 01:49:35.901]  So many other people in alternative media think we're competing with each other.
[01:49:35.901 --> 01:49:41.085]  My show's been successful because I bring the little guys on, the big guys, everybody in between.
[01:49:41.085 --> 01:49:43.487]  I just want freedom for my family.
[01:49:43.487 --> 01:49:45.909]  I understand I'm in a race against the globalists.
[01:49:46.289 --> 01:49:48.830]  And I'm not doing this for fame or fortune.
[01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:55.552]  We certainly try to fund ourselves and be comfortable and have some assets so we can defend ourselves if something comes up.
[01:49:55.552 --> 01:50:02.233]  We need to be strong and powerful so we're trying to become strong and powerful and challenge the system.
[01:50:02.233 --> 01:50:08.315]  That's why I've noticed CIA and FBI funded and it's come out with some of these groups that they are FBI funded.
[01:50:09.184 --> 01:50:14.046]  Try to create racial division, try to make the Liberty Movement be about race or religion.
[01:50:14.046 --> 01:50:15.367]  They try to divide us.
[01:50:15.367 --> 01:50:17.908]  They constantly fight with each other.
[01:50:17.908 --> 01:50:21.909]  They do this not just out of jealousy or greed, but really to divide us.
[01:50:21.909 --> 01:50:23.230]  That's why they attack Ron Paul.
[01:50:23.230 --> 01:50:24.431]  That's why they attack me.
[01:50:24.431 --> 01:50:25.911]  That's why they attack you.
[01:50:25.911 --> 01:50:28.092]  The establishment knows they're discredited.
[01:50:28.092 --> 01:50:30.233]  They can't attack us from their high perches.
[01:50:30.233 --> 01:50:34.095]  They have to attack us from Renamob false grassroots.
[01:50:35.035 --> 01:50:41.518]  And that's because we're effective and it's scaring the system, so I take those attacks as a blessing.
[01:50:41.518 --> 01:50:42.378]  Yep.
[01:50:42.378 --> 01:50:43.599]  Well said, Alex.
[01:50:43.599 --> 01:50:45.540]  Let's keep up the good work here.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:46.920]  Are you going to break right now?
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:47.501]  Yeah, we're going to break.
[01:50:47.501 --> 01:50:51.422]  I'm going to get your take on that and take more calls on the other side.
[01:50:51.422 --> 01:50:53.543]  Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, is our guest.
[01:50:53.543 --> 01:50:54.223]  Stay with us.
[01:50:54.223 --> 01:50:55.144]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[01:51:01.022 --> 01:51:10.084]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[01:51:10.084 --> 01:51:20.007]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.
[01:51:20.007 --> 01:51:28.449]  AlkaZone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and the antioxidant selenium, along with 79 trace minerals from ancient marine deposits.
[01:51:28.729 --> 01:51:34.571]  Unlike other products, AlkaZone is odorless and tasteless and can be added to any beverage to offset its acidity.
[01:51:34.571 --> 01:51:41.834]  AlkaZone also manufactures antioxidant water fountains that will both filter and raise the pH of the tap water in your home to a pH of 10.

[01:51:55.801 --> 01:52:07.010]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:13.977]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:21.144]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:21.144 --> 01:52:23.125]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:23.125 --> 01:52:25.627]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:25.627 --> 01:52:36.594]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.194 --> 01:52:38.856]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:38.856 --> 01:52:40.718]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:40.718 --> 01:52:47.645]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.645 --> 01:52:55.913]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:55.913 --> 01:52:57.474]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.474 --> 01:52:58.676]  The people strike back.
[01:53:00.675 --> 01:53:07.400]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.081]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:53:09.081 --> 01:53:13.644]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:53:13.644 --> 01:53:21.329]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:53:21.329 --> 01:53:23.791]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:53:23.951 --> 01:53:26.192]  And has no dangerous second-hand smoke.
[01:53:26.192 --> 01:53:28.132]  So it's safe for the people around you.
[01:53:28.132 --> 01:53:32.433]  And will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.
[01:53:32.433 --> 01:53:36.154]  So, get rid of the ashtrays, the smell, and the smoke.
[01:53:36.154 --> 01:53:39.455]  Learn more by visiting eCigarettesNational.com.

[01:53:57.685 --> 01:54:00.007]  To purchase, you must be 18 or older.
[01:54:00.007 --> 01:54:07.533]  I was just talking to my guys here in the break.
[01:54:07.533 --> 01:54:14.799]  The FBI has reissued a report they put out seven years ago saying cell phones, farmer's almanac,
[01:54:15.695 --> 01:54:18.158]  Maps are all signs you're a terrorist.
[01:54:18.158 --> 01:54:19.659]  Go ahead and the police pull you over.
[01:54:19.659 --> 01:54:22.062]  Go ahead and put you in a terror database for life.
[01:54:22.062 --> 01:54:24.324]  No firearms, no liberty, no due process.
[01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:24.504]  I mean...
[01:54:25.549 --> 01:54:30.512]  Mike Adams, is that not the ultimate tyranny where they just put you on secret list for no reason?
[01:54:30.512 --> 01:54:39.837]  And what, two years ago, one of the head federal marshals in Denver went public and said, we have a quota of innocent people to put on terror list for life.
[01:54:39.837 --> 01:54:47.181]  And they put a million, two hundred thousand Americans on it we know of since a year ago when they made the list secret.
[01:54:48.652 --> 01:54:58.917]  Yeah, this is one of the processes of tyranny, is putting people on these secret lists outside of the normal process of law, right?
[01:54:58.917 --> 01:54:59.857]  Of due process.
[01:54:59.857 --> 01:55:04.819]  I mean, this is the way to circumvent the Constitution, and they are really clever at this.
[01:55:04.819 --> 01:55:06.480]  They're really good at this.
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.821]  And I think it's going to get a lot worse, Alex, before it gets better.
[01:55:09.821 --> 01:55:12.462]  Something has to happen here.
[01:55:12.462 --> 01:55:18.005]  The American people have got to rally again and to stand up for their freedoms and their rights and to protect
[01:55:18.425 --> 01:55:18.845]  The U.S.
[01:55:18.845 --> 01:55:27.171]  Constitution, which I thought was a valid document, you know, when I was growing up in school and I was being taught American history, gee, I thought that thing still applied.
[01:55:27.171 --> 01:55:30.414]  Only as an adult do you learn that it's been circumvented.
[01:55:30.414 --> 01:55:34.757]  Well, I don't think people realize the process of tyranny.
[01:55:34.757 --> 01:55:44.304]  Once an elite decides to be ruthless and go all the way, and they believe human life is not just a cheat but a negative, once they make that decision, the sky's the limit.
[01:55:45.266 --> 01:55:47.088]  And it's now the sky's the limit.
[01:55:47.088 --> 01:55:49.191]  We're going to keep you another 20 minutes and take calls.
[01:55:49.191 --> 01:55:50.573]  We appreciate you joining us.
[01:55:50.573 --> 01:55:54.497]  Talk to Chris, Tanya, Mary Ann, Dee, Bob and others.
[01:55:54.497 --> 01:56:01.566]  But it sounded like when I mentioned the concerted attacks that are clearly funded against anybody exposing the corruption.
[01:56:01.946 --> 01:56:04.008]  Ron Paul isn't making people take flu shots.
[01:56:04.008 --> 01:56:05.949]  Ron Paul isn't raising people's taxes.
[01:56:05.949 --> 01:56:08.070]  You're not making people take flu shots.
[01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:10.232]  You're not sending SWAT teams to people's homes.
[01:56:10.232 --> 01:56:14.235]  But all this alternative media attacks anybody who's real.
[01:56:14.235 --> 01:56:18.598]  I notice we all get attacked by these concerted operations, mainstream and alternative.
[01:56:19.318 --> 01:56:23.844]  And as much as I'd like to believe it's just jealous people, more and more it's being proven it's government.
[01:56:23.844 --> 01:56:31.813]  And that's their counter, is to try to throw up such a screen of arguing and fighting and infighting that nobody can ever get together.
[01:56:31.813 --> 01:56:37.340]  And I think when you see somebody being attacked and lied about, that's the seal that they're good and can be trusted.
[01:56:38.601 --> 01:56:39.881]  Well, there's no question.
[01:56:39.881 --> 01:56:47.464]  We've been subjected to attacks that were organized and funded by, we think, pharmaceutical companies or their front companies.
[01:56:47.464 --> 01:56:49.765]  And this has just been going on for years.
[01:56:49.765 --> 01:56:51.885]  We hardly even really talk about it anymore.
[01:56:51.885 --> 01:56:56.627]  It's just a routine part of being a publisher of true information.
[01:56:56.627 --> 01:57:04.750]  I mean, you know, the only way to not be harassed in our system today is to lie on behalf of the corporation.
[01:57:05.570 --> 01:57:20.355]  If you go out and you say nice, happy things about the drug company, and about the oil companies, and about all the politicians who are lying to us and sending us into complete bankruptcy, if you say happy things about those people, you'll be left alone.
[01:57:20.355 --> 01:57:22.195]  You won't be harassed by anybody.
[01:57:22.195 --> 01:57:27.997]  It's only when you go out and start asking questions, like what Ron Paul does every single day.
[01:57:27.997 --> 01:57:32.458]  You know, Ron Paul is being attacked precisely because he is affected.
[01:57:32.458 --> 01:57:34.799]  And that's the same reason that you and I are being attacked, Alex.
[01:57:35.424 --> 01:57:37.566]  Well, and also it's a military tactic.
[01:57:37.566 --> 01:57:42.229]  Whenever they deny they're trying to forcibly inoculate nurses, and they are.
[01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:46.932]  Or they lie and say there's no plan to get rid of the dollar as they openly have debates about doing it.
[01:57:46.932 --> 01:57:54.478]  It's a denial so that we just debate whether it exists or not instead of having a real debate about whether we want it or not, or if it's legal or lawful.
[01:57:54.958 --> 01:58:08.807]  And it's the same thing by making it about Alex Jones being bad, or Ron Paul being bad, or Mike Adams being bad, or Dr. Stan Monteith being bad, then even our defenders spend their time defending us instead of going out and warning new people.
[01:58:08.807 --> 01:58:11.349]  So that's why I always tell my listeners, don't defend me!
[01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:15.351]  Go out and reach new people and warn them about fluoride in the water.
[01:58:15.351 --> 01:58:17.111]  Warn them about GMO food.
[01:58:17.111 --> 01:58:18.832]  Warn them about vaccines.
[01:58:18.832 --> 01:58:25.814]  Warn them about the attack on Iran and lying about their processing centers for uranium and how that's a hoax.
[01:58:25.814 --> 01:58:27.314]  Do not defend me.
[01:58:27.314 --> 01:58:30.595]  My family doesn't get saved if you defend me.
[01:58:30.595 --> 01:58:32.035]  Wake everybody up.
[01:58:32.035 --> 01:58:35.516]  Spend your time doing that and then all of us can be saved from this tyranny.
[01:58:35.516 --> 01:58:38.397]  Back in one minute with Mike Adams and your phone calls.
[01:58:38.397 --> 01:58:39.137]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:42.639 --> 01:58:45.268]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.268 --> 01:58:48.459]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:50.691 --> 01:58:54.932]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.932 --> 01:58:56.932]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.932 --> 01:59:05.454]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.454 --> 01:59:10.996]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.996 --> 01:59:12.616]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.856 --> 01:59:19.378]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.378 --> 01:59:30.420]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:31.201]  That's right.
[01:59:31.201 --> 01:59:33.761]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.761 --> 01:59:35.342]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:59:37.282 --> 01:59:38.983]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:11.565 --> 02:00:21.373]  Mike Adams with us for another 20 minutes, and I'm going to get into the economy, a bunch of police state news, and what really happened at the G20, the aftermath of that, and we look at it in hindsight.
[02:00:21.373 --> 02:00:30.319]  Very precedent-setting on multiple fronts, world government being announced, global tax being announced, attacks on Iran being hyped, end of the dollar being hyped.
[02:00:30.319 --> 02:00:35.483]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:00:35.483 --> 02:00:38.666]  Let's talk to Chris in Maryland and Tonya and others.
[02:00:38.666 --> 02:00:39.887]  Chris, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[02:00:40.652 --> 02:00:42.573]  Hey, how you guys doing today?
[02:00:42.573 --> 02:00:43.433]  Good.
[02:00:43.433 --> 02:00:51.497]  Okay, um, I don't know if you guys got this, but I have a document from the federal government that I culled off of Google.
[02:00:51.497 --> 02:00:55.298]  It is the International Swine Flu Conference they had a month ago.
[02:00:55.298 --> 02:00:56.439]  Yeah, we covered it.
[02:00:56.439 --> 02:01:07.503]  We originally broke that, and we had reporters who were there on the show, like Wayne Madsen, but that was forced quarantines, how to deal with dead bodies, lockdowns of cities.
[02:01:07.503 --> 02:01:08.824]  Mike Adams, you want to comment on that?
[02:01:10.134 --> 02:01:11.955]  Uh, no, you're exactly right.
[02:01:11.955 --> 02:01:15.396]  That was a very important piece of breaking news that wasn't supposed to break.
[02:01:15.396 --> 02:01:19.978]  That was supposed to be kept, you know, behind the curtain, but it was exposed.
[02:01:19.978 --> 02:01:26.441]  But do you ever notice now, caller, notice that when you tell people about that, they look at you like you're crazy?
[02:01:26.441 --> 02:01:27.882]  They don't believe it's real?
[02:01:27.882 --> 02:01:29.362]  Have you experienced that?
[02:01:29.362 --> 02:01:33.204]  Oh, man, people, I have my own family calling me a nutjob or
[02:01:33.766 --> 02:01:41.074]  Or one of these people that are getting too into it that I'm gonna go nuts, and I'm like, hey, I'm just trying to find out what's going on around me.
[02:01:41.074 --> 02:01:42.055]  Exactly.
[02:01:42.055 --> 02:01:48.241]  Well, that's because they know they should be going nuts about this tyranny, and they know things are out of control.
[02:01:48.241 --> 02:01:52.065]  And so they're telling you what they're afraid of about themselves.
[02:01:52.065 --> 02:01:52.766]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:01:53.371 --> 02:01:55.754]  One last, well, a couple things.
[02:01:55.754 --> 02:02:03.042]  They had 15 sessions and one of them here in the breakout session one, one of their bullets is conducting morgue operations.
[02:02:03.042 --> 02:02:06.826]  So they were obviously planning on mass casualties and mass deaths.
[02:02:06.826 --> 02:02:10.009]  No, no, they've got quarantines, lockdowns, forced inoculations in there.
[02:02:10.009 --> 02:02:12.272]  Mike Adams, your comments on that document.
[02:02:13.243 --> 02:02:16.465]  Well, when I read that document, you know what the first thing that came to my mind was?
[02:02:16.465 --> 02:02:22.388]  Is that the ultimate plan for health care reform is to reduce the population by 80 percent.
[02:02:22.388 --> 02:02:25.129]  Because then, health care becomes affordable.
[02:02:25.129 --> 02:02:27.070]  Did you see the cover of Newsweek?
[02:02:27.070 --> 02:02:29.972]  Where it said, The Case for Killing Granny?
[02:02:29.972 --> 02:02:31.452]  No, no, haven't seen that one.
[02:02:31.452 --> 02:02:34.794]  In fact, guys, pull up the Newsweek cover, The Case for Killing Granny.
[02:02:34.794 --> 02:02:36.675]  I can't find the actual article.
[02:02:36.675 --> 02:02:38.396]  The actual... Keep going, Mike.
[02:02:39.502 --> 02:02:47.149]  Well, again, this country is going broke treating sickness and disease.
[02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:57.700]  And at some point, it's not unreasonable to think that somebody at high levels would say, you know what, the only way we can afford health care in this country is if we have fewer people to care for.
[02:02:58.581 --> 02:03:12.316]  And my goodness, that whole session that went on there, training for body bags and training for quarantines and training for mass deaths, I mean, that was some really concerning stuff.
[02:03:12.316 --> 02:03:14.279]  You know, it should get you thinking hard about
[02:03:14.779 --> 02:03:16.942]  What's really being planned for the near future?
[02:03:29.705 --> 02:03:31.466]  Uh, but there's no mention of that.
[02:03:31.466 --> 02:03:42.249]  Then, simultaneously, they have all these news articles saying there's too many people, we've got to reduce world population, having kids is bad for your carbon footprint, and by the way, we need to kill Granny.
[02:03:42.249 --> 02:03:47.150]  The case for killing Granny, there's the Newsweek headline online from Newsweek.
[02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:52.612]  Uh, and then they sit there and say, we're gonna kill you, but then it doesn't exist.
[02:03:52.612 --> 02:03:57.794]  And then your neighbor, even if you show your neighbor Newsweek, they go, you're insane, that's a fake Newsweek.
[02:03:57.794 --> 02:03:58.474]  No, I'm not kidding.
[02:04:00.086 --> 02:04:06.949]  You know, this health care reform debate right now is completely congruent with these kinds of evil philosophies.
[02:04:06.949 --> 02:04:26.496]  You know, it's absolutely true now that if this health care reform bill gets passed, and if you don't agree to sign up for health care insurance and pay, what is it, $1,900 a year or so for an individual, or $13,000 for a family, they will be able to arrest you, imprison you for one year, and the IRS can fine you $25,000.
[02:04:28.942 --> 02:04:29.803]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:04:29.803 --> 02:04:31.303]  I'm sorry Mike, I'm sorry Mike.
[02:04:31.303 --> 02:04:32.344]  We have breaking news.
[02:04:32.344 --> 02:04:34.245]  I'm going to cover this with you when we come back.
[02:04:34.245 --> 02:04:36.346]  It always comes out in hindsight.
[02:04:36.346 --> 02:04:37.227]  Look at this video.
[02:04:37.227 --> 02:04:39.108]  They're definitely cops.
[02:04:39.108 --> 02:04:42.490]  Age of Provocateurs, documented at G20 during March.
[02:04:42.490 --> 02:04:45.972]  Infowars.com, exclusive article with the video.
[02:04:45.972 --> 02:04:46.992]  Right now you can look at them.
[02:04:46.992 --> 02:04:48.914]  They're clearly police officers.
[02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:50.114]  Huge guys.
[02:04:50.114 --> 02:04:51.635]  I've seen this over and over again.
[02:04:51.635 --> 02:04:54.557]  Oh my God, oh my God.
[02:04:54.557 --> 02:04:55.938]  That's why they attacked Luke.
[02:04:55.938 --> 02:04:57.839]  They didn't like it that he was exposing them.
[02:04:58.599 --> 02:04:59.780]  Man, these people are evil.
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:00.420]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:00.800]  Stay there.
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:04.181]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.181 --> 02:05:07.803]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.803 --> 02:05:12.384]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.384 --> 02:05:13.805]  These emergency backup systems.
[02:05:13.985 --> 02:05:16.927]  We'll provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:16.927 --> 02:05:23.032]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:23.032 --> 02:05:26.674]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.674 --> 02:05:31.478]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.478 --> 02:05:38.042]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:38.042 --> 02:05:40.004]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.484 --> 02:05:43.687]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:06:00.962 --> 02:06:08.708]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[02:06:08.708 --> 02:06:14.792]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.

[02:06:17.754 --> 02:06:23.659]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:24.019 --> 02:06:25.600]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:28.082]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:28.082 --> 02:06:33.705]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.705 --> 02:06:35.806]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.806 --> 02:06:37.547]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.547 --> 02:06:40.069]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:44.812]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.812 --> 02:06:48.514]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.514 --> 02:06:50.655]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:06:51.616 --> 02:06:53.517]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.517 --> 02:07:01.179]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:01.179 --> 02:07:04.180]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:09.522]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.522 --> 02:07:11.563]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.563 --> 02:07:16.565]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.565 --> 02:07:17.485]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.745 --> 02:07:18.866]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.866 --> 02:07:20.747]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.747 --> 02:07:21.828]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.828 --> 02:07:24.030]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:25.371]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:26.892]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.892 --> 02:07:32.176]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.176 --> 02:07:35.759]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.759 --> 02:07:39.222]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.562 --> 02:07:40.783]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.783 --> 02:07:41.683]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.683 --> 02:07:42.803]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.803 --> 02:07:43.724]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.724 --> 02:07:44.824]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.824 --> 02:07:47.866]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.866 --> 02:07:48.386]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:48.386 --> 02:07:50.067]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:50.067 --> 02:07:51.187]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:51.187 --> 02:07:54.108]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:14.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, the video is flooding in as people have a chance to analyze it.
[02:08:14.503 --> 02:08:17.484]  We're analyzing ours, finding similar things.
[02:08:17.484 --> 02:08:18.505]  Get out of a limited crew.
[02:08:18.505 --> 02:08:20.006]  They just got back Saturday.
[02:08:20.006 --> 02:08:21.827]  We've already posted a lot of videos.
[02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:23.928]  This video is from another activist.
[02:08:23.928 --> 02:08:28.010]  Clearly police officers breaking people's cameras, trying to stir up trouble.
[02:08:28.010 --> 02:08:32.373]  I can't play the audio because there's so much cussing, but these are just two of the three
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:34.521]  And big, huge cops.
[02:08:34.521 --> 02:08:37.184]  They put their biggest cops in to pose as anarchists.
[02:08:37.184 --> 02:08:49.355]  And we're gonna try to match this up with other video of big, scrapping guys who will throw stuff at police so the police have a pretext to then fire and attack the general crowd.
[02:08:49.355 --> 02:08:53.759]  And, uh, I remember... Pardon me?
[02:08:55.615 --> 02:08:58.737]  Yeah, breaking demonstrators' cameras, absolutely.
[02:08:58.737 --> 02:09:00.098]  That's in the video.
[02:09:00.098 --> 02:09:03.539]  We can't play it because there's so much cussing, but look at these cops.
[02:09:03.539 --> 02:09:04.560]  I mean, look at these guys.
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:07.962]  Now, we caught them in Denver last year.
[02:09:07.962 --> 02:09:11.984]  Mainstream news, Denver Post headline, police caught attacking their own police.
[02:09:11.984 --> 02:09:15.366]  We caught them in Canada at the SPP meeting last year.
[02:09:15.366 --> 02:09:19.989]  They were caught, but the BBC admitted it, in England, and they killed a guy, beat him to death.
[02:09:20.954 --> 02:09:22.958]  Uh, these guys need to be criminally charged.
[02:09:22.958 --> 02:09:24.941]  We need to find out who they are.
[02:09:24.941 --> 02:09:27.465]  But it's, I mean, they put these big giant cops in.
[02:09:27.465 --> 02:09:29.749]  Mike Adams, your comment on agent provocateurs?
[02:09:31.127 --> 02:09:36.510]  This is a preview of things to come, Alex, and great work on your part and the contributors who are sending this in.
[02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:38.471]  I can't wait to look at this myself.
[02:09:38.471 --> 02:09:42.853]  But this is what's going to be happening in more cities across the U.S.
[02:09:42.853 --> 02:09:49.476]  And this is a test to see how people react, to see whether they can do this covertly and be exposed.
[02:09:49.476 --> 02:09:58.920]  So the fact that you are exposing them is probably going to help save lives down the road because it's going to help suppress that kind of tactic from being used excessively.
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:00.121]  I mean, they're going to try it anyway.
[02:10:00.561 --> 02:10:08.585]  But the thing is, we keep exposing them, and other people do, and then the Royal Mountain Police admit it, the Denver Police admit it, and no one gets in trouble!
[02:10:08.585 --> 02:10:24.533]  That's why Luke Hradowski was there, and Rob Dewar, there were others saying, don't be violent, you'll have a couple thousand people, or in this case, a couple hundred, you'll have 15 people led by cops, they'll yell and scream and tell Luke, shut up, when he calls out against violence, and then it's cops!
[02:10:24.533 --> 02:10:26.514]  I mean, how evil are these police?
[02:10:27.631 --> 02:10:37.477]  What we've got to do is get some long-range cameras going from people who are away from the immediate fray and who are not in the fight.
[02:10:37.477 --> 02:10:38.537]  That happened in Greece this year.
[02:10:38.537 --> 02:10:42.399]  In fact, pull up Greek TV agent provocateurs.
[02:10:42.399 --> 02:10:50.104]  Uniformed police directing regular cops busting out windows at another global meeting to then blame it on the general protesters.
[02:10:50.104 --> 02:10:50.664]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:10:51.164 --> 02:10:51.825]  Yeah.
[02:10:51.825 --> 02:10:52.826]  No, no, you're exactly right.
[02:10:52.826 --> 02:10:58.792]  I mean, this is like a local law enforcement false flag operation, and they're going to keep doing it for as long as they can get away with it.
[02:10:58.792 --> 02:11:05.559]  But in the video that you're seeing right now, Alex, can you make out the faces very clearly of those responsible?
[02:11:05.559 --> 02:11:08.221]  No, they're wearing masks, but it's big strapping cops.
[02:11:09.479 --> 02:11:11.362]  Uh, I mean, they stick out like a sore thumb.
[02:11:11.362 --> 02:11:12.303]  It's always the same.
[02:11:12.303 --> 02:11:14.785]  I mean, it's big guys.
[02:11:14.785 --> 02:11:16.167]  230, 240 pounds.
[02:11:16.167 --> 02:11:17.268]  They always dress the same.
[02:11:17.268 --> 02:11:19.871]  Ball caps and their face covered.
[02:11:19.871 --> 02:11:22.594]  And, uh, they're breaking people's cameras.
[02:11:22.594 --> 02:11:24.195]  They're starting fights.
[02:11:24.195 --> 02:11:25.417]  They're just absolute scum.
[02:11:26.254 --> 02:11:28.776]  Well, Pittsburgh has been turned into a police state.
[02:11:28.776 --> 02:11:31.838]  I mean, the city was a fortress.
[02:11:31.838 --> 02:11:34.180]  And this is a sign of things to come.
[02:11:34.180 --> 02:11:36.842]  This is important breaking news, so go ahead and roll with it, Alex.
[02:11:36.842 --> 02:11:37.543]  I'll just stand by.
[02:11:37.543 --> 02:11:38.344]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:11:38.344 --> 02:11:39.164]  We're talking flu.
[02:11:39.164 --> 02:11:40.225]  That's more important.
[02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:43.067]  Just, I'm going to cover this with Paul Watson briefly after you leave.
[02:11:43.067 --> 02:11:44.468]  Get him to do a big report on it.
[02:11:44.468 --> 02:11:45.769]  Because it's not enough to just show this.
[02:11:45.769 --> 02:11:48.772]  I'm going to get him to show the Denver stuff and everything else so people forget.
[02:11:48.772 --> 02:11:51.174]  So we want to remind him.
[02:11:51.174 --> 02:11:53.476]  Tanya in Georgia, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[02:11:53.476 --> 02:11:53.816]  Go ahead.
[02:11:54.964 --> 02:11:55.825]  Hi Alex and Mike.
[02:11:55.825 --> 02:12:00.348]  I just want to let you know that I have an insert from my local Walgreens.
[02:12:00.348 --> 02:12:04.430]  It's from the Novartis vaccine for the regular seasonal flu.
[02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:18.620]  It says 2009-2010 formula and right in this document it says it is that fluorine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of fertility.
[02:12:19.397 --> 02:12:24.238]  So, Alex, you've been saying all along that they're putting steroids in it, and it says right here, you know, we are.
[02:12:24.238 --> 02:12:25.838]  This could make you fertile, or infertile.
[02:12:25.838 --> 02:12:30.199]  Oh, yeah, look, look, I mean, it's come out with the IEDs and the vaccines, and they always know.
[02:12:30.199 --> 02:12:39.461]  They design it, and they... Now, explain what the Fluvorin is, and this Endrolucan-2 that they're adding, Mike Adams, but ma'am, I need to go to Walgreens.
[02:12:39.461 --> 02:12:42.882]  Every time I pull up an internet site, it's Walgreens ads for the flu.
[02:12:42.882 --> 02:12:46.683]  I need to get their insert, but will you scan that and email it?
[02:12:47.003 --> 02:12:51.127]  Yeah, I'd prefer to fax it if that's fine and there's a lot of other information in here too.
[02:12:51.127 --> 02:12:53.429]  They say they've been putting H1N1 in the vaccine since 1977.
[02:13:04.179 --> 02:13:06.380]  And they have a long list of side effects that have been reported.
[02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:15.884]  This is a very informative... Okay, read it to us, read it to us, because I knew all this was in there, and I guess I haven't thought, big genius, because I'm not, to go out and get the insert.
[02:13:15.884 --> 02:13:23.347]  I mean, they admit in their literature online they're doing this, but Mike, were you aware of those statements on the Norvitis statement?
[02:13:24.284 --> 02:13:25.366]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:25.366 --> 02:13:27.731]  Remember, those are the ones that are required by federal law.
[02:13:27.731 --> 02:13:31.900]  There's a lot of information that's not required that they're withholding.
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:34.806]  So, as she reads the list, keep in mind what you're not hearing, too.
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:42.745]  Yeah, thanks for holding so long to tell us this, Marianne, or what color is this?
[02:13:42.745 --> 02:13:43.845]  Tanya.
[02:13:43.845 --> 02:13:47.028]  Okay, Tanya, they just changed my list and it erased your name.
[02:13:47.028 --> 02:13:48.629]  Tanya in Georgia.
[02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:50.130]  Tanya, recap.
[02:13:50.130 --> 02:13:53.092]  I'm going to sit back, so is Mike Adams.
[02:13:53.092 --> 02:13:57.114]  Read the cover sheet, what it says, and read us those parts.
[02:13:57.114 --> 02:14:00.917]  Well, it's really, really long, so I'm just going to go through a few points that I was highlighting for you.
[02:14:01.772 --> 02:14:10.098]  The first thing that I noticed is that it says, fluverin has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of fertility.
[02:14:10.098 --> 02:14:14.982]  And then later on where it's talking about who should and should not get the shot, it says nobody under the age of four.
[02:14:14.982 --> 02:14:23.568]  And it also says that it is also not known whether fluverin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity.
[02:14:26.485 --> 02:14:30.687]  It's the expectant mothers that are one of the groups being targeted for this virus, by the way.
[02:14:30.687 --> 02:14:32.448]  I just wanted to interject that.
[02:14:32.448 --> 02:14:39.732]  Right, and this is just a regular seasonal flu, which hasn't been as controversial, so some of the pregnant women might not even be as scared of this one.
[02:14:39.732 --> 02:14:46.715]  And it also says in here that whoever's giving the vaccine is supposed to tell the person that they're giving the shot to the benefits and the risks.
[02:14:46.715 --> 02:14:54.579]  Now, I think if they told somebody, hey, this can make you sterile, you know, this has theramerosol in it, which it also says it does, that, you know, people might not take it.
[02:14:54.579 --> 02:14:55.840]  And I don't think they're telling people that.
[02:14:56.454 --> 02:14:57.655]  How did you get the insert?
[02:14:57.655 --> 02:14:59.056]  You asked for it at Walgreens?
[02:14:59.056 --> 02:15:00.217]  Yeah, and let me tell you, it's funny.
[02:15:00.217 --> 02:15:04.020]  I walked into Walgreens and I said, what kind of shot are you getting?
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:04.920]  What company is it from?
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:05.881]  And they didn't know.
[02:15:05.881 --> 02:15:07.482]  And I said, well, do you have an insert?
[02:15:07.482 --> 02:15:08.223]  And they said, what?
[02:15:08.223 --> 02:15:11.045]  And I go, you know, like a little paper that comes in with your shipment.
[02:15:11.045 --> 02:15:12.386]  So she goes back and she's looking.
[02:15:12.386 --> 02:15:13.527]  I'm assuming this is the pharmacist.
[02:15:13.527 --> 02:15:14.748]  There was two women back there.
[02:15:14.748 --> 02:15:15.488]  They're looking around.
[02:15:15.488 --> 02:15:18.871]  They come back with this piece of paper they pulled out of the bottom of the box of vials.
[02:15:19.298 --> 02:15:20.759]  All folded up, very tiny.
[02:15:20.759 --> 02:15:26.180]  Unfold it right in front of me and say, here, let me start, you know, I'm looking at it, and it's really long, and I said, can I just take this with me?
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:27.421]  And they said, oh yeah, sure, take it.
[02:15:27.421 --> 02:15:29.161]  Like, they had no interest in it.
[02:15:29.161 --> 02:15:35.963]  Well, this is important, and I've read that this stuff's in there, but it's another thing to actually have the insert.
[02:15:35.963 --> 02:15:37.184]  I'm gonna give you our facts.
[02:15:37.184 --> 02:15:44.726]  The problem is, on those tiny, you know, regular-sized sheet of paper, they fold it up tiny to go in the vial, and it's tiny, tiny wording.
[02:15:44.726 --> 02:15:46.507]  I don't know if that'll fax, but you can try.
[02:15:46.507 --> 02:15:47.207]  I blew it up.
[02:15:48.038 --> 02:15:52.680]  Oh, you blew it up.
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:54.781]  It's 866-894-1767.
[02:15:54.781 --> 02:15:57.722]  That's 866-894-1767.
[02:15:57.722 --> 02:16:01.624]  Will you go ahead and fax that to us as soon as possible?
[02:16:01.624 --> 02:16:07.886]  Is there no way that, because if you blew it up, can you scan it and email it to Watson?
[02:16:07.886 --> 02:16:09.387]  Because people need to see that.
[02:16:09.727 --> 02:16:10.347]  Yeah, I got it.
[02:16:10.347 --> 02:16:14.529]  I'm gonna leave my house right now and go fax it to you, but I had one other question for Mike.
[02:16:29.241 --> 02:16:40.226]  Also in this insert it says that it's very important that you shake the vial in between each dosage and I'm wondering if if they don't shake it does that mean that you can get like an even higher amount of mercury than what they're saying?
[02:16:41.428 --> 02:16:42.549]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:48.012]  And this is one of the reasons why you've got to be very careful if you even get a vaccine of where you get it.
[02:16:48.012 --> 02:17:03.582]  Because many of the people administering these vaccines, especially in these retail outlets, they are properly shaking up the vaccine, which means you could get a concentration of the thimerosal or other chemicals that's up to 200 times higher than what it's supposed to be.
[02:17:03.582 --> 02:17:05.884]  So your baby could get the one shot
[02:17:06.204 --> 02:17:10.449]  That's 200 times more toxic than the next baby that they actually shook the vial for.
[02:17:10.449 --> 02:17:13.332]  And that's one of the reasons why vaccines are so dangerous.
[02:17:13.332 --> 02:17:18.779]  The people giving these shots are not following the rules, and they probably didn't even read the insert that you read.
[02:17:18.779 --> 02:17:20.100]  No, I don't think they read it.
[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:20.601]  I don't think they did.
[02:17:20.601 --> 02:17:24.826]  I'm going to leave right now and go ahead and text the team and let you move on, but I just wanted to make sure that you were aware that this was coming to you.
[02:17:25.851 --> 02:17:36.094]  You know, the reason that they include that language in that insert, Alex, is so that if infertility problems become widespread, they can say, well, we warn you.
[02:17:36.094 --> 02:17:40.235]  You know, they can just disavow any responsibility.
[02:17:40.235 --> 02:17:44.556]  But then, meanwhile, the nightly news says it doesn't sterilize you.
[02:17:44.556 --> 02:17:52.578]  Sure, the White House science czar says he wants to sterilize you through vaccines in your water, but that's okay.
[02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:56.391]  And then you read the insert, oh, it's gonna might sterilize you.
[02:17:56.391 --> 02:17:57.432]  Well, that's okay.
[02:17:57.432 --> 02:18:00.433]  You know, the government's good people.
[02:18:00.433 --> 02:18:01.414]  These are good people.
[02:18:01.414 --> 02:18:05.596]  We ought to, you know, be sterilized.
[02:18:05.596 --> 02:18:12.499]  I had a reporter from a mainstream network news organization call me maybe two weeks ago.
[02:18:12.499 --> 02:18:15.340]  Wanted to interview me about swine flu vaccine.
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:18.962]  Obviously was looking for, you know, an alternative viewpoint.
[02:18:18.962 --> 02:18:21.283]  He swore to me, up and down, that he had been
[02:18:22.077 --> 02:18:28.381]  Told by the drug companies themselves that there was no thimerosal used in any of the swine flu vaccine.
[02:18:28.381 --> 02:18:30.903]  And I tried to educate this reporter.
[02:18:30.903 --> 02:18:32.003]  I said, no, you're wrong.
[02:18:32.003 --> 02:18:33.604]  There's thimerosal in there.
[02:18:33.604 --> 02:18:35.646]  And he said, no, there isn't.
[02:18:35.646 --> 02:18:36.786]  It's not being used.
[02:18:36.786 --> 02:18:45.192]  And to this day, that network, which I don't want to name, but they've been reporting stories on the swine flu vaccine and claiming there's no thimerosal in it.
[02:18:45.928 --> 02:18:53.189]  Even though I can pull up a hundred releases from the medical companies admitting they put a higher dose of the Marisol in this one.
[02:18:55.390 --> 02:19:03.436]  You know, what has happened to the skepticism and just the common sense of our mainstream journalists these days?
[02:19:03.436 --> 02:19:06.919]  Or when they get caught lying, it's like, oh, you lied to me, that's good.
[02:19:06.919 --> 02:19:09.420]  I would be mad at you if you didn't lie to me.
[02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:11.102]  It's like it's cute and funny.
[02:19:11.102 --> 02:19:13.463]  Oh, Bayer, you knowingly gave me AIDS in the shot.
[02:19:13.463 --> 02:19:14.184]  Oh, thank you.
[02:19:14.184 --> 02:19:15.845]  And it's like, Bayer is trusted.
[02:19:15.845 --> 02:19:16.646]  They like to murder.
[02:19:18.681 --> 02:19:20.542]  Oh, Gardasil's killing a bunch of people!
[02:19:20.542 --> 02:19:21.602]  Oh, how good!
[02:19:21.602 --> 02:19:24.843]  Oh, it's so... How dare you talk bad about them!
[02:19:24.843 --> 02:19:30.986]  Well, listen, Mike Adams, Health Ranger, NaturalNews.com, great job today.
[02:19:30.986 --> 02:19:37.768]  Thank you for all your insight, and I hope to come visit you sometime down in Ecuador, or next time you fly back through into the States, through Texas.
[02:19:37.768 --> 02:19:38.369]  Come and see us.
[02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:40.569]  We really appreciate your time.
[02:19:40.569 --> 02:19:42.110]  Thank you, Alex, and all listeners.
[02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.450]  Thank you.
[02:19:42.450 --> 02:19:43.651]  It's been an honor.
[02:19:43.651 --> 02:19:44.851]  Man, it's just been great having you.
[02:19:44.851 --> 02:19:46.852]  By the way, I know a lot of people have these inserts.
[02:19:47.933 --> 02:19:52.159]  Scan them, send them to ridersandinfowars.com with a brief description.
[02:19:52.159 --> 02:19:52.980]  We need to get that up.
[02:19:52.980 --> 02:19:55.903]  I mean, that's simple stuff I forget to do.
[02:19:55.903 --> 02:19:56.584]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:56.584 --> 02:19:56.865]  Thank you.
[02:20:01.144 --> 02:20:02.045]  You worry.
[02:20:02.045 --> 02:20:04.107]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:20:04.107 --> 02:20:06.750]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:08.892]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:20:08.892 --> 02:20:10.493]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:20:10.493 --> 02:20:14.097]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:20:14.097 --> 02:20:19.322]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:20:19.322 --> 02:20:22.625]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:20:23.288 --> 02:20:24.969]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:20:24.969 --> 02:20:27.870]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:20:27.870 --> 02:20:31.331]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:20:31.331 --> 02:20:39.974]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:20:39.974 --> 02:20:44.796]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[02:20:54.636 --> 02:20:58.038]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:58.038 --> 02:21:00.059]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:21:00.854 --> 02:21:03.036]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.036 --> 02:21:03.876]  Spy on me?
[02:21:03.876 --> 02:21:04.216]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.216 --> 02:21:09.260]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:10.881]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:10.881 --> 02:21:11.621]  Startpage?
[02:21:11.621 --> 02:21:13.142]  Yeah, Startpage.com.
[02:21:13.142 --> 02:21:16.104]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:16.104 --> 02:21:19.987]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:19.987 --> 02:21:22.849]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:23.109 --> 02:21:25.730]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:27.311]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:27.311 --> 02:21:27.612]  Right!
[02:21:27.612 --> 02:21:30.933]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[02:21:30.933 --> 02:21:31.494]  Hello, folks.
[02:21:31.494 --> 02:21:32.854]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:21:32.854 --> 02:21:36.716]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:21:36.716 --> 02:21:40.499]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[02:21:55.087 --> 02:22:01.252]  That's startpage.com.
[02:22:01.252 --> 02:22:03.293]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:03.293 --> 02:22:06.255]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[02:22:06.255 --> 02:22:08.797]  Certainly not in my 17 years in the industry.
[02:22:08.797 --> 02:22:10.739]  Nearly 100 banks have been shuttered this year.
[02:22:11.198 --> 02:22:14.359]  As many as 200 more banks are suspect by year's end.
[02:22:14.359 --> 02:22:16.820]  The FDIC is operating in the red.
[02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:17.901]  Who pays for that?
[02:22:17.901 --> 02:22:19.081]  Is your money safe?
[02:22:19.081 --> 02:22:23.143]  The dollar's lost over 95% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:22:23.143 --> 02:22:26.505]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:22:26.505 --> 02:22:27.785]  Ours is not immune.
[02:22:27.785 --> 02:22:29.966]  The time is now to be proactive.
[02:22:29.966 --> 02:22:32.287]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[02:22:32.287 --> 02:22:33.468]  CDs, annuities, 401ks,
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:37.221]  IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[02:22:37.221 --> 02:22:41.044]  So decide, do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[02:22:41.044 --> 02:22:42.245]  The choice is yours.
[02:22:42.245 --> 02:22:43.325]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[02:22:43.325 --> 02:22:44.246]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[02:22:44.246 --> 02:22:45.266]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[02:22:45.266 --> 02:22:46.227]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[02:23:00.393 --> 02:23:04.137]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guy.
[02:23:04.137 --> 02:23:11.304]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[02:23:11.304 --> 02:23:16.630]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:18.492]  Lucky for you, there's the freeze-dry guy.
[02:23:18.672 --> 02:23:25.173]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[02:23:25.173 --> 02:23:30.114]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[02:23:30.114 --> 02:23:39.436]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:23:39.436 --> 02:23:46.098]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[02:23:46.578 --> 02:23:48.658]  They play us off black, white, old, young against each other.
[02:23:48.658 --> 02:23:49.379]  They divide us along religion.
[02:23:49.379 --> 02:23:50.399]  They divide us across party.
[02:24:17.403 --> 02:24:29.129]  Well, the establishment is a scientific dictatorship who studies what makes humans tick and uses that material, that data, to control us.
[02:24:29.129 --> 02:24:42.036]  Saturday, September 26, three undercover officers attempt to infiltrate a march against police brutality at the University of Pittsburgh, but fail miserably due to their horrendous
[02:24:43.243 --> 02:24:44.904]  The sky's attempts.
[02:24:44.904 --> 02:24:47.506]  During the march, one of them breaks a photographer's camera.
[02:24:47.506 --> 02:24:52.770]  This is just one example of a larger pattern of attempts to silence the media during the G20 protest.
[02:24:52.770 --> 02:24:57.293]  And if you would have dare broke a cop's camera, they'd charge you with assault with a deadly weapon or something.
[02:24:57.293 --> 02:25:02.257]  But it's okay for them to beat up women and use police dogs and break the law and smash your camera.
[02:25:04.244 --> 02:25:07.506]  Because they work for a lawless criminal corporate takeover.
[02:25:07.506 --> 02:25:10.028]  And they love the vaccines they get shot full of.
[02:25:10.028 --> 02:25:11.909]  They love their kids being retarded.
[02:25:11.909 --> 02:25:13.050]  They love the tyranny.
[02:25:13.050 --> 02:25:14.871]  They love having bankruptcy.
[02:25:14.871 --> 02:25:15.271]  They love it.
[02:25:15.271 --> 02:25:19.133]  That's why they have the highest suicide rates, highest rates of drug use.
[02:25:19.133 --> 02:25:21.975]  They're unhappy because they work for the dark side.
[02:25:21.975 --> 02:25:29.340]  I'm not saying all police, but certainly the police they shipped in from Miami-Dade County, and the Border Patrol they shipped in, and the National Guard.
[02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:31.261]  These were un-American pieces of trash.
[02:25:32.779 --> 02:25:32.919]  Alex?
[02:25:52.108 --> 02:25:53.509]  Hi there.
[02:25:53.509 --> 02:26:02.395]  Listen, first I wanted to tell you that I really appreciate all your work and I do pass it on to my friends and family.
[02:26:02.395 --> 02:26:06.778]  But I wanted to talk to you about a couple things that are going on in Maryland.
[02:26:06.778 --> 02:26:19.407]  I was a teacher for 10 years and every year the regular flu shot was offered to us for free on several specific dates at the beginning of the school year.
[02:26:20.303 --> 02:26:24.806]  And, you know, there was a lot of pressure from your peers to get this shot.
[02:26:24.806 --> 02:26:26.526]  I never got the shot.
[02:26:26.526 --> 02:26:31.109]  But, you know, people would be like, you're going to get sick, blah, blah, blah.
[02:26:31.109 --> 02:26:34.911]  Well, there's something going on at the University of Maryland right now.
[02:26:34.911 --> 02:26:41.595]  I'm not sure if you know about, but it has been quote, unquote, rumored that 557 cases of swine flu are going on since classes began.
[02:26:48.716 --> 02:26:55.700]  And the students are actually pressuring each other to go and get the swine flu vaccine.
[02:26:55.700 --> 02:26:57.061]  Yeah, it's all mind control.
[02:26:57.061 --> 02:27:00.243]  No, I have seen that at other big universities.
[02:27:00.243 --> 02:27:03.025]  One in Washington State had 2,000 cases.
[02:27:03.025 --> 02:27:05.146]  And a lot of times it's even fake announcements.
[02:27:05.146 --> 02:27:09.669]  They're just doing it as a psy-op to test, forcing everyone to stampede.
[02:27:10.169 --> 02:27:13.670]  And that's why little kids come to my house and they go, look, I got the shot.
[02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:14.570]  Have you had the shot?
[02:27:14.570 --> 02:27:17.990]  And my little kids are asking me now, why aren't we getting shots?
[02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:19.111]  And I said, you don't want them, honey.
[02:27:19.111 --> 02:27:19.691]  They're bad for you.
[02:27:19.691 --> 02:27:21.691]  And they go, but I want one.
[02:27:21.691 --> 02:27:23.371]  The neighbor kids got them.
[02:27:23.371 --> 02:27:28.732]  So now they've got kids from not wanting shots to thinking, oh, it's a prize I get.
[02:27:28.732 --> 02:27:32.013]  But you read the inserts to know it sterilizes you, but that's OK.
[02:27:32.013 --> 02:27:33.493]  They told you so.
[02:27:33.493 --> 02:27:33.893]  I know.
[02:27:33.893 --> 02:27:36.994]  But see, this is like really super weird.
[02:27:36.994 --> 02:27:37.894]  This is totally
[02:27:39.144 --> 02:27:42.748]  Going along with everything you talk about because- 1984!
[02:27:42.748 --> 02:27:47.434]  Yes, people who do not get the shot have to wear a face mask.
[02:27:48.382 --> 02:27:52.223]  So, it's obvious to other people that they haven't gotten a shot.
[02:27:52.223 --> 02:27:53.883]  Yeah, it's all part of hysteria.
[02:27:53.883 --> 02:27:59.264]  It's the new, it's part of being classified, wearing a yellow star, being in a terror database.
[02:27:59.264 --> 02:28:06.006]  It's all about the new medical tyranny of just like THX 1138 when he's helping the kid put the injector back on his arm.
[02:28:06.006 --> 02:28:07.666]  Oh, you've had your 20 shots this week.
[02:28:07.666 --> 02:28:09.107]  You're of the Lord.
[02:28:09.107 --> 02:28:10.107]  You're of the government.
[02:28:11.027 --> 02:28:13.129]  Obama loves the little children.
[02:28:13.129 --> 02:28:16.992]  Red, yellow, black and white, they are equal in our leader's sight.
[02:28:16.992 --> 02:28:19.253]  You see, you're starting to understand now.
[02:28:19.253 --> 02:28:23.656]  Yes, they're making people wear these at universities and at police departments.
[02:28:23.656 --> 02:28:26.839]  There's no law, they just make you do it.
[02:28:26.839 --> 02:28:32.122]  And when you pay to go to college, you pay to go be brainwashed and taught how to worship government.
[02:28:32.122 --> 02:28:32.943]  That's it, basically.
[02:28:34.354 --> 02:28:37.896]  Well, I mean, I've been through graduate school at Johns Hopkins.
[02:28:37.896 --> 02:28:38.736]  It's happening there.
[02:28:38.736 --> 02:28:43.158]  So you're saying those people need to go shoot video of this?
[02:28:43.158 --> 02:28:44.098]  Yeah.
[02:28:44.098 --> 02:28:59.145]  Well, unfortunately, I had to stop teaching because I'm disabled now, but they're also at the University of Maryland Medical Center saying that young children need to be given two doses of the swine flu vaccine.
[02:29:01.592 --> 02:29:03.192]  Two or three.
[02:29:03.192 --> 02:29:04.533]  Two or three.
[02:29:04.533 --> 02:29:06.693]  See, they said four to give people.
[02:29:06.693 --> 02:29:07.173]  That's a lot.
[02:29:07.173 --> 02:29:08.494]  They said, oh, it's only two now.
[02:29:08.494 --> 02:29:09.814]  People went, oh.
[02:29:09.814 --> 02:29:13.475]  Don't worry, there won't be any more pain for the children.
[02:29:13.475 --> 02:29:16.535]  There won't be any more high intelligence or frustration.
[02:29:16.535 --> 02:29:19.696]  You'll just learn how to take your shots.
[02:29:19.696 --> 02:29:22.297]  Come on, the government's good.
[02:29:22.297 --> 02:29:26.978]  But I do have one question for you, and that is regarding Navarro, Chip.
[02:29:28.271 --> 02:29:35.833]  I read an article a very long time ago that it was so small that it could be injected through a hypodermic needle.
[02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:40.695]  And I'm wondering if this is part of that.
[02:29:40.695 --> 02:29:42.535]  Let me break it down on the other side.
[02:29:42.535 --> 02:29:47.597]  I'll briefly do that, take more calls, get into some financial news, and more of what happened to the G20.
[02:29:47.597 --> 02:29:48.177]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.177 --> 02:29:48.877]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:48.877 --> 02:29:51.318]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:51.318 --> 02:29:52.718]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.718 --> 02:29:54.219]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.237 --> 02:30:00.901]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.901 --> 02:30:05.165]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.165 --> 02:30:07.166]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.166 --> 02:30:15.693]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.693 --> 02:30:21.237]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.237 --> 02:30:22.858]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.078 --> 02:30:29.604]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.604 --> 02:30:40.655]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.655 --> 02:30:41.435]  That's right.
[02:30:41.435 --> 02:30:43.998]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:43.998 --> 02:30:45.579]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:48.141 --> 02:31:06.086]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.086 --> 02:31:10.607]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.607 --> 02:31:12.887]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.887 --> 02:31:14.508]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.508 --> 02:31:15.548]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.788 --> 02:31:24.214]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:37.703 --> 02:31:43.728]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:32:01.443 --> 02:32:03.205]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[02:32:03.205 --> 02:32:04.707]  Say no to toxic overload.
[02:32:04.707 --> 02:32:06.049]  Say no to chemicals.
[02:32:06.049 --> 02:32:07.992]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[02:32:07.992 --> 02:32:16.703]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[02:32:16.783 --> 02:32:22.207]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[02:32:22.207 --> 02:32:24.008]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[02:32:24.008 --> 02:32:31.494]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[02:32:31.494 --> 02:32:35.677]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.

[02:33:08.754 --> 02:33:13.618]  You know, I sent Rob Doo and Aaron Dykes up to Canada, and they were really impressed with Alan Watt.
[02:33:13.618 --> 02:33:14.819]  He's really a classy guy.
[02:33:14.819 --> 02:33:22.885]  And I've interviewed him many times over the years on the radio, but getting to see him on high-def TV, editing him for the film, he's a neat guy.
[02:33:22.885 --> 02:33:26.388]  And he's going to be in Fall of the Republic 1 and 2.
[02:33:26.388 --> 02:33:31.573]  In fact, even more in 2, though he's one of the central figures in Fall of the Republic 1.
[02:33:32.808 --> 02:33:46.218]  Along with Webster Tarpley, and Jesse Ventura, and John Perkins, and Max Keiser, and G. Edward Griffin, uh, and, uh, just so many other people.
[02:33:46.218 --> 02:33:49.581]  Gerald Cilente.
[02:33:49.581 --> 02:33:50.681]  The list goes on and on.
[02:33:50.681 --> 02:33:53.383]  The film is absolutely jam-packed.
[02:33:53.383 --> 02:33:56.065]  Of course, I'm in it.
[02:33:56.065 --> 02:33:58.347]  Here's the world premiere of our fourth trailer.
[02:33:58.347 --> 02:33:59.328]  We had the first trailer
[02:33:59.906 --> 02:34:00.246]  We're good to go.
[02:34:24.096 --> 02:34:24.436]  Most people
[02:34:53.124 --> 02:35:00.791]  Still today think that all entertainment to do with movies, drama, is therefore nothing more than their entertainment.
[02:35:00.791 --> 02:35:02.553]  It never ever was that case.
[02:35:02.553 --> 02:35:08.278]  Throughout history, social engineers have refined techniques designed to control large populations.
[02:35:08.278 --> 02:35:10.521]  It is bringing entertainment to thousands of people.
[02:35:11.381 --> 02:35:13.442]  Right in the comfort of our own home.
[02:35:13.442 --> 02:35:18.024]  You're actually in an alpha state being completely downloaded with new ideas.
[02:35:18.024 --> 02:35:22.467]  A cult of personality can be manufactured to influence the masses.
[02:35:22.467 --> 02:35:24.248]  Nobody will question what he's doing.
[02:35:24.248 --> 02:35:28.950]  They'll be so preoccupied with where he is or what he's wearing.
[02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:30.170]  Yes, we can!
[02:35:30.170 --> 02:35:32.472]  The idea of making him into a celebrity.
[02:35:32.472 --> 02:35:38.094]  Eventually, he said, they will expect the media to do all their thinking and reasoning for them.
[02:35:38.094 --> 02:35:38.975]  That's happened today.
[02:35:39.835 --> 02:35:46.463]  The scientific dictatorship understands what makes human beings tick, and they're using it against us.
[02:35:46.463 --> 02:35:51.449]  These cells are scanned by a stream of electrons, completing 30 pictures a second.
[02:35:51.449 --> 02:35:53.512]  It's hard for people like that.
[02:35:53.899 --> 02:35:57.682]  It's taken serious interest in what their elected officials are doing.
[02:35:57.682 --> 02:35:58.823]  They've been programmed.
[02:35:58.823 --> 02:36:02.566]  It's Obama's role to front for the International Banking Syndicate.
[02:36:02.566 --> 02:36:06.089]  Barack Obama is a puppet of the New World Order.
[02:36:06.089 --> 02:36:07.510]  Is this some sort of New World Order?
[02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:09.271]  The New World Order is emerging.
[02:36:09.271 --> 02:36:13.434]  For the first time in history, we really have this new form of an empire.
[02:36:13.434 --> 02:36:16.116]  The average man and woman is in a trance.
[02:36:16.116 --> 02:36:17.578]  They get home from work.
[02:36:17.578 --> 02:36:19.259]  They don't even talk to their children.
[02:36:19.259 --> 02:36:20.420]  They turn the television on.
[02:36:21.189 --> 02:36:26.130]  And they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives.
[02:36:26.130 --> 02:36:33.153]  You've got time to watch baseball, you've got time to entertain yourself, but a knowledgeable public we're losing.
[02:36:33.153 --> 02:36:37.134]  Kill your television, or at least turn it off a few hours a day.
[02:36:37.134 --> 02:36:39.895]  The children aren't even playing in your front yards anymore.
[02:36:39.895 --> 02:36:48.157]  We don't want to live under a world government of the corporations, by the corporations, and for the corporations.
[02:36:50.490 --> 02:36:53.911]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:36:53.911 --> 02:36:55.232]  Volume 1.
[02:36:55.232 --> 02:36:57.852]  The Presidency of Barack Obama.
[02:36:57.852 --> 02:37:03.014]  Obama is the latest version of 21st century mass mind control.

[02:37:09.616 --> 02:37:10.096]  October 21st, 2009.
[02:37:15.370 --> 02:37:20.517]  So, there is the third trailer, fourth coming out next week, and the fifth the day before it comes out.
[02:37:20.517 --> 02:37:25.584]  We've got some special sneak peeks, too, for folks just at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:25.584 --> 02:37:27.747]  For the balance of the radio show, I'll have a quick economic
[02:37:28.852 --> 02:37:29.553]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:37:59.352 --> 02:38:15.879]  I want to go over all of this with you today, but before we get into that, what is most important right now in the mind of Alan Watt, in your deep reflection and analysis as you cut through the Matrix, what's key that's developing right now that Alan Watt thinks we should all know about?
[02:38:15.879 --> 02:38:22.742]  I think we should know what the New World Order really is.
[02:38:22.742 --> 02:38:24.863]  It's a non-democratic system.
[02:38:25.575 --> 02:38:36.018]  A world to be ruled by experts and professionals from all different sciences, including all the social sciences, they go under the term of world peace.
[02:38:36.018 --> 02:38:50.201]  And that sounds nice and fuzzy to most people, but when you break down in their own writings, from their own writings, what they mean by world peace, it literally is a form of totalitarianism from birth to grave.
[02:38:51.002 --> 02:38:59.518]  Uh, to do with, uh, in fact, they wanted to separate the children completely from parents so they wouldn't be contaminated with old fashioned values and ideas.
[02:39:00.489 --> 02:39:08.336]  But they've found with scientific indoctrination, kindergarten onwards, any parental input is made null and void.
[02:39:08.336 --> 02:39:09.977]  So they've pretty well reached that stage.
[02:39:09.977 --> 02:39:24.769]  They can literally program the generations with every intake, every year of kindergarten, upgrade incrementally for what they will experience in their lifetime, and they'll accept that which they've experienced because they've been taught it at school as coming.
[02:39:26.565 --> 02:39:29.930]  What you're looking at, really, is a totalitarian world system.
[02:39:29.930 --> 02:39:33.896]  A depopulation plan is at the top of it, too.
[02:39:33.896 --> 02:39:37.361]  The unfit, as they call them, in a post-industrial era.
[02:39:37.361 --> 02:39:41.607]  Remember, too, all the scientists across the world now and all the professions believe in evolution.
[02:39:41.607 --> 02:39:42.749]  It's taught right off the bat.
[02:39:43.470 --> 02:39:47.014]  They believe in Darwinian evolution, survival of the fittest.
[02:39:47.014 --> 02:39:48.475]  They believe that we are the old man.
[02:39:48.475 --> 02:39:57.845]  All the old types that used to work in factories, the blue collar workers, are now obsolete with the emergence of science and robots and genetic technology.
[02:39:57.845 --> 02:40:02.810]  They can create new types of better servants and not as many as they have now.
[02:40:02.810 --> 02:40:05.013]  All of this is coming down the pipe as we see.
[02:40:05.613 --> 02:40:16.659]  Even the move, as you say, to stop neighbors from looking after your child for a couple hours when they run off for some groceries is forbidden across the board in all the countries at the same time, as you say.
[02:40:16.659 --> 02:40:25.504]  And that is also to stop contamination and bonding to other people in your little locality with old-fashioned ideas.
[02:40:25.504 --> 02:40:31.888]  It's okay to put them into a recommended state-approved daycare place for a day because they get the correct kind of
[02:40:32.348 --> 02:40:37.911]  And simultaneously, Europe and the US and England and Canada announced they want year-round school.
[02:40:37.911 --> 02:40:42.432]  And the internal documents 20 years ago said to break up the families entirely.
[02:40:42.432 --> 02:40:46.394]  They've got the men and women working overtime so they can't spend time with their kids.
[02:40:46.394 --> 02:40:54.738]  And then if you want to use the neighbor... In fact, it even said in England, BBC, two groups of police officers aren't allowed to watch their own kids.
[02:40:54.738 --> 02:40:59.720]  And the thing was, wow, even the godlike police aren't allowed to watch their kids.
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:08.344]  And now 20,000 homes in England, they have cameras watching the kids, they go to bed on time, eat what they're supposed to.
[02:41:08.344 --> 02:41:09.625]  This is Orwell.
[02:41:09.625 --> 02:41:13.507]  Yes, and that's a pilot project for the rest of the country.
[02:41:13.507 --> 02:41:19.150]  And whatever happens in Britain eventually, very rapidly actually, is introduced across the British Commonwealth.
[02:41:19.150 --> 02:41:22.652]  And we're still a Commonwealth, we're still basically a subsidiary of Britain.
[02:41:23.352 --> 02:41:24.473]  And then the U.S.
[02:41:24.473 --> 02:41:26.013]  picks up very quickly, too.
[02:41:26.013 --> 02:41:29.935]  Everything's working together because we're already under a global system.
[02:41:29.935 --> 02:41:31.336]  We have been for a long time.
[02:41:31.336 --> 02:41:43.201]  And before even the war started on Iraq, the first one, the Gulf War I, we're being fed on the news that we're all global, global, global.
[02:41:43.201 --> 02:41:46.503]  We went back to being national again, but they wanted recruits for the military.
[02:41:46.503 --> 02:41:49.965]  They've kept that up for face value, but in reality,
[02:41:50.825 --> 02:42:01.530]  And we're going to speak more about that, but since you mentioned the military, notice how in March of last year, in the U.S., in England, and in Canada, but also in Ireland and Scotland, simultaneously, because I'm, just like you do, scanning all the Western media,
[02:42:19.548 --> 02:42:22.198]  Also, Asian media that's in English.
[02:42:22.198 --> 02:42:24.887]  Simultaneously on the same day!
[02:42:26.007 --> 02:42:37.932]  They deployed troops in downtown cities and said, oh, they're just helping with drunk drivers, helping with checkpoints, and now it's, and then they go, oh yes, it's for terrorists and for gun owners.
[02:42:37.932 --> 02:42:43.434]  So right as they implode the economy, they deploy the troops worldwide and then admit it's global.
[02:42:43.434 --> 02:42:52.718]  I mean, it's all a private corporate Borg deploying this, now coming after our farms and ranches, our children, any form of independence.
[02:42:53.467 --> 02:43:04.081]  Yes, they laid out a plan a long time ago when they set up the League of Nations, the forerunner of the United Nations, and in their own charter they said eventually they'd ban all private property.
[02:43:04.081 --> 02:43:09.168]  They'd also have to eradicate farming because farming was too important to be left to farmers.
[02:43:09.708 --> 02:43:14.129]  Big corporations would run the farming of the world.
[02:43:14.129 --> 02:43:26.213]  We're simply going through a pre-planned agenda, but now with the century of change, and that's the key to it, this is the century of change that all academia was talking about for 50 odd years.
[02:43:26.213 --> 02:43:27.853]  We're into the century of change.
[02:43:27.853 --> 02:43:29.114]  It's not democratic.
[02:43:29.114 --> 02:43:34.075]  We see now the rise of this entity, this legal entity of the EU.
[02:43:34.275 --> 02:43:35.156]  We're good to go.
[02:44:04.199 --> 02:44:26.274]  When you read the writings of the big players in the last 50 to 100 years involved in these international movements, like the Huxleys, like both the Huxleys, in fact, Julian and Aldo Huxley and Russell and others, they say straight out that this world will be run by a form of scientific dictatorship where the public will simply obey.
[02:44:26.274 --> 02:44:28.315]  That's the whole key to everything now is obey.
[02:44:28.315 --> 02:44:29.556]  You're an animal.
[02:44:29.556 --> 02:44:32.758]  We can retrain you like any animal, the Pavlovian concept.
[02:44:33.493 --> 02:44:36.935]  And your job is to serve the world state.
[02:44:36.935 --> 02:44:37.676]  That's my job.
[02:44:49.329 --> 02:44:59.121]  Since we are in the position of power, that means genetically we got the power because we were the best, and so we're helping the Earth by killing you.
[02:44:59.121 --> 02:45:04.387]  They're testing soft kill weapons, sterilization, as the White House science czar spoke about.
[02:45:04.387 --> 02:45:06.330]  I want to go over this with you today.
[02:45:07.188 --> 02:45:14.875]  But more than that, they get the general public to adopt the eugenics ideas, but they don't even consciously know why.
[02:45:14.875 --> 02:45:16.316]  Yeah, humans are a parasite.
[02:45:16.316 --> 02:45:17.757]  Yeah, there's too many of us.
[02:45:17.757 --> 02:45:20.680]  We don't have art and literature and spacecraft.
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:27.886]  We can't do incredible things, which we actually are an incredible species, a wonderful species, a self-aware species.
[02:45:31.297 --> 02:45:51.013]  The elites believe they're gods, they believe they're wonderful, and they want to control the future, and so they only sell the public on lowering their survival instinct so they will accept and make it a religious sacrament, dying for their carbon footprint, or not having children, or being sacrificed to the earth.
[02:45:52.654 --> 02:46:05.605]  So this idea that man is crud, man is crap, they sell this and sell this and say you have no rights, you're just an animal, it's a mind game, it's a huckster scam to say you can make no decisions, you're just programmed.
[02:46:06.434 --> 02:46:19.626]  But then, oh, the elites have to have their rights, they have to have their bodyguards, oh, they're free, they write all this sick, dark, nihilistic poetry about how they control everything and they'll destroy everything if they want to.
[02:46:19.626 --> 02:46:24.370]  So, inherently, these are very sick, evil control tricks.
[02:46:24.370 --> 02:46:26.572]  There's no doubt about it at all.
[02:46:26.572 --> 02:46:28.413]  It's a religion with them.
[02:46:28.413 --> 02:46:32.457]  It's a complete... It fulfills all the criteria of a religious belief system.
[02:46:33.166 --> 02:46:33.346]  I think?
[02:46:48.072 --> 02:46:49.614]  And they believe in power.
[02:46:49.614 --> 02:46:53.017]  Total power is the main key to survival.
[02:46:53.017 --> 02:46:56.420]  Therefore, they're the ones at the top with the total power.
[02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:58.282]  And they do plan to exercise it.
[02:46:58.282 --> 02:47:00.344]  They are exercising it now.
[02:47:00.344 --> 02:47:08.312]  I just went through stuff that was released from the World Health Organization, from some of its meetings that have never disclosed to the public before.
[02:47:08.312 --> 02:47:11.816]  And they admit, during their own discussions, their internal debates,
[02:47:12.443 --> 02:47:23.289]  That most of these vaccines, all of the vaccines in fact, the vast bulk of the contaminants in them, including genetic contaminants and viruses, are unknown to them.
[02:47:23.289 --> 02:47:29.292]  Sometimes 90% of every inoculation in polio still is unknown to them.
[02:47:29.292 --> 02:47:31.453]  They don't know the effects on the body except
[02:47:32.307 --> 02:47:41.190]  With the new adjuvants they're using for this upcoming swine flu shot, they do know that they're using, rather than chicken eggs, they're using cancer viruses.
[02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:42.530]  They admit that in their own writings.
[02:47:42.530 --> 02:47:53.134]  They're using cancer viruses for the simple reason that cancer viruses are almost indestructible, so it will stay in your body forever, supposedly to protect your body.
[02:47:53.254 --> 02:47:53.374]  No!
[02:48:11.406 --> 02:48:12.567]  Now, Alan, stop.
[02:48:12.567 --> 02:48:15.610]  This is mind-blowing, and we're on the same page.
[02:48:15.610 --> 02:48:20.575]  This is admitted in hundreds of government textbooks, like Ecoscience, but the White House Science Czar.
[02:48:20.575 --> 02:48:33.307]  We now have bought over 10 books he authored, all saying the same sickening stuff about how they would do this, inject us with cancer viruses that would trigger, as soon as our hormone levels lower to men and women between 45 and 65.
[02:48:33.307 --> 02:48:34.589]  We now see that happening.
[02:48:35.049 --> 02:48:43.821]  The boldness, what do you call the boldness of where they openly say they're killing us, where they openly admit the first 10 million people in Canada and the U.S.
[02:48:43.821 --> 02:48:50.010]  to get the nasal live flu virus, they admit it's going to mutate it and spread it.
[02:48:50.010 --> 02:48:50.411]  Yes.
[02:48:50.411 --> 02:48:51.652]  So in plain view,
[02:48:52.797 --> 02:48:56.359]  They admit it has cancer viruses in the major German and British news.
[02:48:56.359 --> 02:48:59.962]  We're shooting cancer viruses live into our nostrils.
[02:48:59.962 --> 02:49:02.944]  They admit the Gardasil's killing the girls and mutating.
[02:49:02.944 --> 02:49:04.985]  It's own inventor came out and said don't take it.
[02:49:04.985 --> 02:49:06.806]  I'm sure they'll kill her or something.
[02:49:06.806 --> 02:49:10.529]  The point is, is that... What do you call that?
[02:49:10.529 --> 02:49:11.009]  Because I see...
[02:49:23.131 --> 02:49:23.451]  We're good.
[02:49:41.451 --> 02:49:46.834]  So they're training the victim to accept his own death and put it down to coincidence.
[02:49:46.834 --> 02:49:53.138]  It's amazing that they understand what they can do to the public because they've lied so many times in the past.
[02:49:53.138 --> 02:49:56.700]  They know the formulas and the techniques and they know how we respond.
[02:49:56.700 --> 02:50:07.487]  If there's 1% of credibility in their arguments, the public will want to believe them rather than cross the line and say, these guys are killing us.
[02:50:07.487 --> 02:50:10.569]  Because the average person, just like in Hardin, Montana, when I caught
[02:50:11.755 --> 02:50:12.175]  That's correct.
[02:50:30.402 --> 02:50:36.784]  And these are all eugenicists, and they talk about, they go, it's sad we have to kill everyone, but it's for the Earth.
[02:50:52.375 --> 02:50:54.536]  Everybody out there, you gotta warn everybody you can.
[02:50:54.536 --> 02:50:58.017]  They're implanting you and your family with cancer viruses.
[02:50:58.017 --> 02:50:59.137]  These also spread.
[02:50:59.137 --> 02:51:01.238]  It's not just a shot.
[02:51:01.238 --> 02:51:05.719]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[02:51:05.719 --> 02:51:10.000]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:20.824]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[02:51:20.824 --> 02:51:22.244]  These key ingredients not only support
[02:51:26.988 --> 02:51:27.669]  We're good to go.
[02:51:53.197 --> 02:51:53.718]  We're good.
[02:52:01.678 --> 02:52:09.204]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:52:09.204 --> 02:52:13.708]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:52:13.708 --> 02:52:18.852]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:52:18.852 --> 02:52:26.338]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:52:26.338 --> 02:52:30.702]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[02:52:31.002 --> 02:52:37.003]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:52:37.003 --> 02:52:43.945]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[02:53:02.536 --> 02:53:04.277]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:53:04.277 --> 02:53:06.960]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:12.105]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:53:12.105 --> 02:53:15.288]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:54:23.616 --> 02:54:34.701]  Alright, I want to open the phones up next hour for Alan Watts, specifically on eugenics, the master plan, how to stop them, what they're doing.
[02:54:34.701 --> 02:54:35.542]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:35.542 --> 02:54:36.342]  800-259-9231.
[02:54:36.342 --> 02:54:39.584]  He can talk about any issue, but please address your questions to Alan Watts.
[02:54:39.584 --> 02:54:43.206]  I don't want to talk about a tractor you got for sale, or two Bacabras in your attic.
[02:54:43.206 --> 02:54:46.067]  And I'm not being mean, I just... Sometimes people do that.
[02:54:46.067 --> 02:54:49.328]  Especially if we have a guest, it's like they will not address anything to them.
[02:54:49.328 --> 02:54:50.169]  It's...
[02:54:50.987 --> 02:54:55.671]  Kind of like Piggly Wiggly gets the head of the line and then nobody else gets to get on.
[02:54:55.671 --> 02:54:57.212]  So, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:57.212 --> 02:54:59.214]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[02:54:59.214 --> 02:55:03.477]  Alan, we were just talking during the break about social control.
[02:55:03.477 --> 02:55:09.442]  It's just like the Aztecs, one of the dominant Mesoamerican, uh, uh, Mayan cultures.
[02:55:09.442 --> 02:55:20.391]  And in their own writings, and in what the Spanish observed, mothers would beg to have their healthiest, best, because you wanted to have the best sacrifice, 10-year-old only son
[02:55:21.354 --> 02:55:24.897]  Cut up in pieces and then sold as meat by the priest class.
[02:55:24.897 --> 02:55:26.939]  That's how they made their money to the locals.
[02:55:26.939 --> 02:55:29.622]  And the mothers would gobble their children with pleasure.
[02:55:29.622 --> 02:55:31.443]  We have major...
[02:55:32.828 --> 02:55:35.049]  News out of Seoul, Korea and China.
[02:55:35.049 --> 02:55:37.390]  This is mainstream baby soup.
[02:55:37.390 --> 02:55:38.811]  Not a hoax.
[02:55:38.811 --> 02:55:40.172]  Eating babies.
[02:55:40.172 --> 02:55:44.734]  People get upset if they see a dog killed by Marines, but not if they see a kid killed by Marines.
[02:55:44.734 --> 02:55:47.375]  We've been trained to see human life as bad.
[02:55:47.375 --> 02:55:56.780]  And through mind control, just through cultural mind control, Aztecs would kill their sons and daughters and wives and husbands with pleasure.
[02:55:56.780 --> 02:55:59.402]  The Druids would do this.
[02:55:59.402 --> 02:56:00.562]  And it's the same thing now.
[02:56:00.562 --> 02:56:02.203]  We just give our kids to the state.
[02:56:02.873 --> 02:56:11.479]  Because our guest said earlier, in England, the mother said, yeah, it was really hard to lose the weight, ruined my figure.
[02:56:11.479 --> 02:56:17.063]  They said that was a symbol of depression, so they took the baby from the family with no due process.
[02:56:17.063 --> 02:56:18.984]  The criminal state is here.
[02:56:18.984 --> 02:56:20.185]  Go ahead.
[02:56:20.185 --> 02:56:24.148]  Yes, again, too, interesting to look at the old video.
[02:56:24.148 --> 02:56:26.269]  I think it's still up maybe on YouTube, I don't know.
[02:56:26.269 --> 02:56:28.851]  I can't watch it because of my slow speech.
[02:56:28.851 --> 02:56:30.652]  They punish me for using ExploreNet.
[02:56:33.422 --> 02:56:44.587]  There was a Julian Huxley up there, an Aldo Huxley, and these guys went into this whole thing, and Aldo Huxley himself, who attended all the world meetings, he also worked at Tavistock Institute.
[02:56:44.587 --> 02:56:56.033]  He thought that the scientific dictatorship would be just so wonderful when it came in, and that people would be trained to love their servitude, but he also talked about the only obstacle they had
[02:56:57.395 --> 02:57:05.660]  At that time, back in the 50s, was the remnants of a powerful, or almost post-powerful, Christianity.
[02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:10.663]  That ties in with what his brother Julian said, the first CEO of UNESCO.
[02:57:10.663 --> 02:57:21.430]  He said, we'll have to train the people to devaluate human life in order to bring through mass abortions and eventually genetic selection and sterilization.
[02:57:22.462 --> 02:57:25.084]  So, this is the plan unfolding now.
[02:57:25.084 --> 02:57:28.286]  These guys were part of the big world meetings of their day.
[02:57:28.286 --> 02:57:35.230]  They set their agendas, they set their timetables, they set it for the end of the millennium into the new that's now.
[02:57:35.230 --> 02:57:38.112]  And that's why they called this the Century of Change.
[02:57:38.112 --> 02:57:39.973]  And they never alter their plan.
[02:57:39.973 --> 02:57:43.495]  Their plans are like long-term business plans set in stone.
[02:57:43.495 --> 02:57:49.999]  With 10-year plans for one part, 50 for another, 100 for another, we see this same type of plan cropping up.
[02:57:50.643 --> 02:57:51.243]  I don't know.
[02:58:17.549 --> 02:58:27.171]  This is happening as we live, and the public don't even know it's happening because they're trained to ignore and not participate in their own destiny.
[02:58:27.171 --> 02:58:28.931]  Got a break, coming back.
[02:58:28.931 --> 02:58:32.092]  50 minutes left in the next hour with Alan Wynne.
[02:58:32.092 --> 02:58:33.992]  This is what's happening.
[02:58:33.992 --> 02:58:38.153]  And they're training us to turn our own predator instinct on our own species.
[02:58:38.153 --> 02:58:40.514]  That's what the police, the military, all of it is.
[02:58:43.669 --> 02:58:46.151]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.151 --> 02:58:50.915]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.915 --> 02:58:54.297]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.297 --> 02:58:57.920]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.920 --> 02:59:02.504]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.504 --> 02:59:08.088]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.368 --> 02:59:13.152]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.152 --> 02:59:16.775]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.775 --> 02:59:21.579]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.579 --> 02:59:28.144]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.144 --> 02:59:30.106]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.586 --> 02:59:33.787]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.787 --> 02:59:38.288]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:59:38.288 --> 02:59:40.508]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.508 --> 02:59:40.809]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.809 --> 02:59:41.509]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:59:54.358 --> 02:59:56.740]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.740 --> 02:59:59.521]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:16.732 --> 03:00:20.075]  Alan, we were talking again about how they train us to feed on ourselves.
[03:00:20.075 --> 03:00:21.236]  They domesticate us.
[03:00:21.236 --> 03:00:24.398]  They train us not to notice what's happening.
[03:00:44.657 --> 03:00:47.418]  And this whole agenda's rushing forward.
[03:00:47.418 --> 03:00:48.998]  Continue.
[03:00:48.998 --> 03:01:05.383]  Well, going into the writings again of some of the biggest players who did publish lots of their work, we find their techniques, because they explained their techniques, and they were so assured of them working, that it had only been done because of previous experimentation on populations.
[03:01:06.198 --> 03:01:09.501]  I'm going back to the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s.
[03:01:09.501 --> 03:01:18.189]  The Huxleys, for instance, talked about people loving their servitude and they often used the term domestication.
[03:01:18.189 --> 03:01:19.570]  Domesticate the public.
[03:01:19.570 --> 03:01:27.297]  What they meant was, and they even said this, that the only true survivors that are fit to survive are wild animals that retain all of the survival capabilities.
[03:01:28.183 --> 03:01:34.667]  In order to rule all the lesser types, the inferior humans, who haven't made it to the top, you'd have to domesticate them.
[03:01:34.667 --> 03:01:38.789]  That meant to eradicate their instincts for self-preservation.
[03:01:38.789 --> 03:01:43.892]  Train them that experts were looking after everything that they should look after by themselves.
[03:01:44.933 --> 03:01:48.736]  And the extent where they couldn't do anything without expert advice.
[03:01:48.736 --> 03:01:52.760]  Well, we've had a massive campaign since about the 50s onwards.
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:58.365]  Listen to the experts all through magazines, TVs, even in news breaks or even weather breaks.
[03:01:58.365 --> 03:02:02.688]  You get experts coming on telling you how to dress for the rain.
[03:02:02.688 --> 03:02:05.291]  This is a form of domestication.
[03:02:05.291 --> 03:02:07.893]  It's meant to make you think that you know nothing.
[03:02:07.893 --> 03:02:09.214]  You're too stupid to understand.
[03:02:10.084 --> 03:02:11.604]  And just accept it.
[03:02:11.604 --> 03:02:18.106]  Accept there are better types of people above you taking care of all the big problems that you should be taking care of.
[03:02:18.106 --> 03:02:28.188]  And your job is to simply play as much as you can play and enjoy yourself and don't become involved in the big problems in life to do with politics, policies or anything else.
[03:02:28.188 --> 03:02:28.909]  Just accept it.
[03:02:28.909 --> 03:02:30.849]  That's called domestication.
[03:02:30.849 --> 03:02:36.190]  Until you literally have no self-preservation instincts left.
[03:02:36.190 --> 03:02:39.111]  When that happens, you're now ready for extermination.
[03:02:39.759 --> 03:02:47.025]  And then they can even train you, as you say, they're training the children to volunteer for sterilization to save the world.
[03:02:47.025 --> 03:02:51.489]  And, of course, this new religion of ecology is a religion.
[03:02:51.489 --> 03:02:56.694]  As Gorbachev said, we are creating a new religion based on a form of earth worship.
[03:02:56.694 --> 03:03:02.459]  But, of course, it's got its own high priests that decide who should procreate and who should not procreate.
[03:03:03.019 --> 03:03:05.422]  And that's not fast enough for them.
[03:03:05.422 --> 03:03:07.725]  They want to start killing us off even faster.
[03:03:07.725 --> 03:03:15.215]  We're not breeding enough in the West to tell us that we're almost sterile, and hence the immigration levels are massive.
[03:03:15.215 --> 03:03:20.261]  However, we're not dying fast enough across the world, so they want to speed up the process.
[03:03:20.681 --> 03:03:24.623]  And you can't kill the children, so you mustn't tell them any truth.
[03:03:24.623 --> 03:03:30.906]  You must say, it's all so strange that these cancers are affecting everyone and everyone's dying.
[03:03:30.906 --> 03:03:31.746]  And that'll be taught.
[03:03:31.746 --> 03:03:33.687]  It's just a new happening.
[03:03:33.687 --> 03:03:34.428]  Well, they're saying that.
[03:03:34.428 --> 03:03:47.954]  They're saying you're all just gonna die of cancer, and you're all just gonna die of diabetes, and doesn't matter what you do, just take your shot and you're gonna die, and there's gonna be lots of deaths, and yeah, it's a live virus, and yeah, you're gonna die, but it wasn't the vaccine, but it does say on the insert, it may kill you.
[03:03:48.694 --> 03:03:56.419]  And this Gardasil is going to kill you, but it doesn't protect you from the cancer, but it will give you cancer, but everything's fine.
[03:03:56.419 --> 03:04:02.563]  And they just throw it all out there, and it's like the public really is in a trance.
[03:04:02.563 --> 03:04:11.749]  Now more and more of them are starting to wake up, so the establishment's program is to shock us even more and pile on, hoping people just give up.
[03:04:12.921 --> 03:04:14.562]  Yeah, it's a technique.
[03:04:14.562 --> 03:04:18.005]  They give you the dialectical process, the pros and the cons.
[03:04:18.005 --> 03:04:22.568]  They get you into a punch-drunk state, and you simply give up.
[03:04:22.568 --> 03:04:29.914]  And then you say, well, they can't be doing this for negative reasons to kill us, so I'll just go along with the rest of the public.
[03:04:29.914 --> 03:04:31.775]  That's how simple it is.
[03:04:31.775 --> 03:04:39.621]  People look around for a hero to follow, and if there's no heroes, they simply go along with the rest of the public and do what they do.
[03:04:39.621 --> 03:04:40.762]  That's what Huxley said himself.
[03:04:41.909 --> 03:04:48.175]  Now let's talk about, in the short term, what their program is, long term, but also solutions.
[03:04:48.175 --> 03:04:52.780]  How you think this battle is going to shake out, and what things will look like if they win.
[03:04:52.780 --> 03:04:55.202]  Any other important angles Alman-Watt wants to cover.
[03:04:55.202 --> 03:04:56.083]  And then your phone calls.
[03:04:56.083 --> 03:04:58.685]  That'll take us in lots of interesting, random directions.
[03:04:58.685 --> 03:04:59.506]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.506 --> 03:04:59.867]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.721 --> 03:05:04.723]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.723 --> 03:05:10.048]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.048 --> 03:05:12.109]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.109 --> 03:05:17.093]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.093 --> 03:05:18.014]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.274 --> 03:05:19.395]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.395 --> 03:05:21.276]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.276 --> 03:05:22.357]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.357 --> 03:05:24.559]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.559 --> 03:05:25.900]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.900 --> 03:05:27.421]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.421 --> 03:05:32.705]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.705 --> 03:05:36.288]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.288 --> 03:05:39.751]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.091 --> 03:05:41.312]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.312 --> 03:05:42.233]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.233 --> 03:05:43.333]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.333 --> 03:05:44.254]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.254 --> 03:05:45.355]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.355 --> 03:05:48.397]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.397 --> 03:05:50.178]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.178 --> 03:05:51.099]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.734 --> 03:06:06.041]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.041 --> 03:06:10.587]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.587 --> 03:06:12.870]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:14.472]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.472 --> 03:06:15.514]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.734 --> 03:06:24.159]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:06:37.646 --> 03:06:43.671]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[03:07:12.501 --> 03:07:13.642]  Well, now you can.
[03:07:13.642 --> 03:07:15.822]  Introducing the Magic Yellow Flyer.

[03:07:31.328 --> 03:07:33.069]  You need the Magic Yellow Flyer.
[03:07:33.069 --> 03:07:38.053]  Corporate America is destroying our country and it's time to rebuild the backbone of America.

[03:08:07.501 --> 03:08:08.803]  Big Brother.
[03:08:08.803 --> 03:08:10.565]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:10.565 --> 03:08:12.327]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:12.327 --> 03:08:13.909]  You want answers?
[03:08:13.909 --> 03:08:15.491]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:15.491 --> 03:08:19.677]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.677 --> 03:08:23.722]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:29.065 --> 03:08:34.850]  Extremely intriguing and informative and enlightening interview with Ellen Wadeput at TheMatrix.com here in a moment.
[03:08:34.850 --> 03:08:37.011]  And we're going to open the phones up.
[03:08:37.011 --> 03:08:42.636]  Before we do that, though, I want to thank a few of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[03:08:42.636 --> 03:08:45.518]  One of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[03:08:45.518 --> 03:08:47.880]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes.
[03:08:49.131 --> 03:08:50.352]  Snow and ice storms.
[03:08:50.352 --> 03:08:53.993]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[03:08:53.993 --> 03:08:58.136]  A solar power generator is now available from our long-time sponsor, Solutions for Science.
[03:08:58.136 --> 03:09:00.257]  You can use it to run an Ecola Blue, whatever.
[03:09:00.257 --> 03:09:08.901]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of a power source, a 800-watt generator, and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:09:08.901 --> 03:09:12.943]  Remember, too, that generators, like gas generators, need gas, but in a blackout,
[03:09:13.503 --> 03:09:16.265]  Gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[03:09:16.265 --> 03:09:18.366]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[03:09:18.366 --> 03:09:21.949]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[03:09:21.949 --> 03:09:23.289]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:09:23.289 --> 03:09:25.171]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[03:09:25.171 --> 03:09:26.712]  Or give the great folks a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:09:26.712 --> 03:09:26.792]  877-327-0365.
[03:09:26.792 --> 03:09:29.193]  Got a new sponsor here I'm really excited about.
[03:09:29.193 --> 03:09:29.814]  It's EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:09:42.492 --> 03:09:44.074]  Ecuadorcentral.com.
[03:09:44.074 --> 03:09:49.578]  You've heard of all the folks moving down there like the health ranger and people.
[03:09:49.578 --> 03:09:54.383]  And this will let you know if you're going to move down there or get a second home down there or bug out for a while down there.
[03:09:54.383 --> 03:09:55.764]  You want to be in the mountains.
[03:09:55.764 --> 03:09:56.825]  Explains that kind of stuff.
[03:09:57.615 --> 03:10:09.807]  Uh, it is your duty to know every option you have to protect you and your family, whether you are looking for a rental property or a new start, or if you just want to know your options, I urge you to go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:10:09.807 --> 03:10:11.608]  E-C-U-A-D-O-U-R.
[03:10:13.410 --> 03:10:15.431]  Just added a word to that, a letter to that.
[03:10:15.431 --> 03:10:18.873]  E-C-U-A-D-O-R Central.
[03:10:18.873 --> 03:10:20.594]  EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:10:20.594 --> 03:10:21.815]  The website is great.
[03:10:21.815 --> 03:10:25.658]  It will give you all the information you would want to know before you go.
[03:10:25.658 --> 03:10:29.220]  Go to EcuadorCentral.com and see what these folks are doing.
[03:10:29.220 --> 03:10:35.564]  Whether you're interested in real estate investment, travel, or just want to see pictures and videos, go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:10:35.564 --> 03:10:38.065]  That's EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:10:38.065 --> 03:10:40.747]  And lastly here, I want to thank the great sponsors
[03:10:41.527 --> 03:10:47.489]  Uh, at efoodsdirect.com, the premier storable foods company, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[03:10:47.489 --> 03:10:58.312]  They have an entire organic line, and it's all about being larger meals than what other places have, fresher meals, no GMO, no MSG.
[03:10:58.312 --> 03:11:00.613]  It's just great, and it was all recently produced.
[03:11:00.613 --> 03:11:02.853]  I mean, like last month, or quicker.
[03:11:02.853 --> 03:11:04.794]  I mean, this isn't some 10-year-old junk you're buying.
[03:11:06.653 --> 03:11:08.334]  Once you get it, it lasts more than 10 years.
[03:11:08.334 --> 03:11:09.814]  So, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:11:09.814 --> 03:11:11.215]  One word, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:11:11.215 --> 03:11:12.995]  I'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:11:12.995 --> 03:11:16.336]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 1-800-409-5633.
[03:11:16.336 --> 03:11:21.198]  1-800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com.
[03:11:21.198 --> 03:11:24.379]  And it is these sponsors that make the whole show possible.
[03:11:24.379 --> 03:11:25.379]  How are we able to do this?
[03:11:25.379 --> 03:11:26.660]  How are we able to have this facility?
[03:11:27.924 --> 03:11:33.306]  Be on shortwave and AM and FM and reach all these people and have these webmasters and all this bandwidth.
[03:11:33.306 --> 03:11:35.407]  You, the supporters, and the sponsors.
[03:11:35.407 --> 03:11:37.367]  I want to thank all of you out there.
[03:11:37.367 --> 03:11:41.149]  All right, Alan, I'm going to shut up for this rest of this segment before we go to calls.
[03:11:41.149 --> 03:11:50.772]  Getting into what their current operation is, what you think is happening with the flu, those new World Health Organization documents you have, they're up on CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com, and
[03:11:53.386 --> 03:11:56.827]  Well, I think the people first have to understand that they're not dealing with democratic institutions.
[03:11:56.827 --> 03:12:01.369]  You're dealing with people with an agenda who are all pre-chosen before they get into politics.
[03:12:22.412 --> 03:12:27.113]  into their roles, and they're all on board with this agenda.
[03:12:27.113 --> 03:12:31.174]  So technically, there's no negotiation with them, to be honest with you.
[03:12:31.174 --> 03:12:41.656]  The only thing that's left outside of outright revolution is for large groups of people to literally hit them economically.
[03:12:41.656 --> 03:12:50.318]  For instance, an example, the nurses of New York State have been told that they're going to be fired if they don't take this swine flu shot.
[03:12:51.895 --> 03:13:08.679]  My suggestion to them is for them to walk off en masse and just walk out the hospital en masse for a day or two and you'll see the howls and the screams as those guys want you to bring you to the negotiating table that these are the only kinds of strategies left for people outside revolution.
[03:13:08.679 --> 03:13:19.001]  And the boys at the top know this because they've been setting up internal armies and securities for 20 years for this particular time that we're going through now.
[03:13:19.557 --> 03:13:21.778]  They knew this time would come.
[03:13:21.778 --> 03:13:25.641]  So, to be honest, there's no easy way out of this.
[03:13:25.641 --> 03:13:29.783]  This is life or death situations that we're going through right now.
[03:13:29.783 --> 03:13:32.124]  They have their depopulation program.
[03:13:32.124 --> 03:13:41.250]  The World Health Organization at their meeting in 2006, their world meeting, stated that if they can get the public to accept mandatory inoculation for one thing,
[03:13:41.966 --> 03:13:51.169]  Then introduce more mandatory inoculations every year for the rest of the adult's life, including annual boosters for every shot they've ever had.
[03:13:51.169 --> 03:13:52.730]  We're going to be toxic.
[03:13:52.730 --> 03:14:00.532]  Laboratories, walking out laboratories, walking test tubes with a competent DNA all getting together and killing us all the quicker through cancers.
[03:14:00.532 --> 03:14:02.553]  They know this at the top.
[03:14:02.553 --> 03:14:07.775]  So the thing is, you can't take a step forward to negotiate if what you say is no.
[03:14:08.621 --> 03:14:11.902]  That's the word we're going to relearn, is no, and say, no, I'm not taking this.
[03:14:11.902 --> 03:14:15.963]  I don't care what you want to do with me, because you're going to kill me anyway.
[03:14:15.963 --> 03:14:18.043]  So I'm not taking this shot.
[03:14:18.043 --> 03:14:23.024]  And people have got to start regaining their individual rights and freedoms.
[03:14:23.024 --> 03:14:25.785]  If you don't fight for them, you don't have any.
[03:14:25.785 --> 03:14:30.626]  You can't write something on a piece of paper and go back to sleep thinking it's all done.
[03:14:30.626 --> 03:14:32.426]  And even the founding fathers of the U.S.
[03:14:32.426 --> 03:14:35.147]  said that every generation would have to fight to keep it.
[03:14:36.013 --> 03:14:36.293]  And Alan?
[03:14:36.293 --> 03:14:38.015]  And Alan continuing on the flu front...
[03:14:55.549 --> 03:14:57.870]  They're now ordering kids to go to school to take it.
[03:14:57.870 --> 03:14:59.291]  No law, they just do it.
[03:14:59.291 --> 03:15:03.694]  Clinics all over the country are saying take it or we'll call CPS on you.
[03:15:03.694 --> 03:15:05.335]  No law, they just do it.
[03:15:05.335 --> 03:15:21.705]  We're seeing the real tyranny and they're bragging that they're setting the precedent to force over 56 vaccine boosters, so that's now in the hundreds, every couple years of meningitis shots, hepatitis shots, the AIDS vaccine.
[03:15:21.705 --> 03:15:24.467]  And Bill Gates has now bragged, and it's in the Associated Press,
[03:15:26.155 --> 03:15:28.536]  When he laughs, when he gives a speech.
[03:15:28.536 --> 03:15:32.758]  Oh, I found out we're giving people polio with the new vaccine.
[03:15:32.758 --> 03:15:34.619]  It happens to be live.
[03:15:34.619 --> 03:15:38.962]  And then the little elite clubs, they all giggle because the local good old boys, they're in on the fun.
[03:15:39.881 --> 03:15:40.901]  That's Nigeria.
[03:15:40.901 --> 03:15:50.884]  Nigeria has now got a new evolved type of polio that they admit now that the World Health Organization came from the particular vaccine they were giving the people there.
[03:15:50.884 --> 03:15:55.345]  It's evolved into a new hyper polio that's rampaging through the public.
[03:15:55.345 --> 03:15:57.326]  It came from the vaccine, they admit it became
[03:15:57.886 --> 03:16:07.314]  And now they admit in the mainstream literature that the live nasal vaccine is going to create hundreds of mutations and is what's spreading H1N1.
[03:16:07.314 --> 03:16:14.319]  So out in the open, they hit us with all the fools that are shooting it up their kids' nose, sneezing on everybody.
[03:16:15.160 --> 03:16:18.403]  And the public is so dumbed down, they can't even understand it.
[03:16:18.403 --> 03:16:27.130]  Again, they've been trained that experts don't lie, and we've had 50 years of training into this new type of system.
[03:16:27.130 --> 03:16:28.351]  The public can't believe.
[03:16:28.351 --> 03:16:35.497]  You can get up the ladder, but until you literally cross the last rung and stand on it, you won't see the big picture.
[03:16:35.497 --> 03:16:38.799]  And the last rung is difficult to cross and see.
[03:16:38.799 --> 03:16:40.421]  They're not just talking about killing us.
[03:16:40.421 --> 03:16:42.903]  They have been killing us, and they want to kill more of us.
[03:16:43.223 --> 03:16:50.767]  When you really understand that, it's true, that you'll see everything completely different from then on as to what you can do.
[03:16:50.767 --> 03:16:54.448]  You see, you can't negotiate with tyranny.
[03:16:54.448 --> 03:16:57.810]  Well, the key here is they're not negotiating, they're not stopping.
[03:16:57.810 --> 03:16:59.611]  It's a power cult.
[03:16:59.611 --> 03:17:02.332]  And we have to admit, they're testing the soft kill now.
[03:17:02.332 --> 03:17:05.073]  And I want to talk some about solutions here.
[03:17:05.073 --> 03:17:10.136]  But everything you bring up, just literally flags come up because it's all so accurate.
[03:17:13.191 --> 03:17:23.996]  You know, dealing with all of this and watching them kill us, and then all these petty power people who don't even care if they're being killed themselves, as long as they can kill people under them.
[03:17:23.996 --> 03:17:25.216]  It's very sick.
[03:17:25.216 --> 03:17:26.197]  Yes.
[03:17:26.197 --> 03:17:28.057]  And again, too, the test of all of this.
[03:17:28.057 --> 03:17:30.478]  Stanford is a big player in this.
[03:17:30.478 --> 03:17:36.341]  All the universities have their specialized areas in creating vaccines or vaccines or viruses for warfare purposes.
[03:17:36.983 --> 03:17:39.965]  But they're also into the social science and psychology.
[03:17:39.965 --> 03:17:45.330]  And Stanford is one of the prime universities for mass control, basically.
[03:17:45.330 --> 03:17:57.239]  They did the old Milgaard experiments on testing people's obedience to authority by shocking people, at least training people, that they're actually shocking a victim on the other side of the glass.
[03:17:57.819 --> 03:18:07.943]  It wasn't the registrar, just another side of the glass, but they didn't know, and they got to kill voltage on the dial there as long as someone above them took authority and responsibility for it.
[03:18:07.943 --> 03:18:10.824]  They know how to use the public against the public.
[03:18:10.824 --> 03:18:12.525]  Yeah, 90%!
[03:18:12.525 --> 03:18:24.850]  You can take a farm boy and make him a cop, six months later 90% in the Stanford research will put a gun to their mother's head and blow her brains across the room if someone in a uniform orders them to do it.
[03:18:24.850 --> 03:18:24.970]  Yes.
[03:18:25.770 --> 03:18:26.430]  And it's true.
[03:18:26.430 --> 03:18:35.374]  These are all techniques that have been understood by the high sciences and occult guys and masonry and so on at the top.
[03:18:35.374 --> 03:18:37.675]  You find it in the riots of New York in the 1800s.
[03:18:40.655 --> 03:18:47.963]  The mayor, at the time of the whole riots, he said that we can always hire half the poor to kill the other half.
[03:18:47.963 --> 03:18:49.184]  That's what he said.
[03:18:49.184 --> 03:18:50.926]  They understand this.
[03:18:50.926 --> 03:18:52.668]  Money is the key.
[03:18:52.668 --> 03:18:54.229]  I can survive and get money.
[03:18:54.229 --> 03:18:56.612]  I'll go on the winning side, they'll leave me alone.
[03:18:56.612 --> 03:19:01.237]  That's what they think, until their usefulness is over, and then they're eliminated too.
[03:19:03.795 --> 03:19:04.515]  Unbelievable.
[03:19:04.515 --> 03:19:05.216]  Alan, let's do this.
[03:19:05.216 --> 03:19:12.700]  Let's come back and take calls, and then at the end of the last segment, let's get into a little bit of solutions, but we're going to have you back up for more of that as well.
[03:19:12.700 --> 03:19:28.530]  But I guess what you're saying is the big solution is becoming aware of this matrix of propaganda and social engineering, and really getting upset about it, and really talking human to human about the ruling elite and their program for humanity, and ask the public, do you like being controlled?
[03:19:28.530 --> 03:19:29.671]  Do you like being poisoned?
[03:19:30.271 --> 03:19:35.912]  Do you like everybody being blubbery and bleached skin and unhealthy and zits all over the place?
[03:19:35.912 --> 03:19:37.133]  I mean, do you like being poisoned?
[03:19:37.133 --> 03:19:41.514]  Do you like half the kids in your neighborhood dead or dying of diseases or cancer?
[03:19:41.514 --> 03:19:42.374]  I mean, is this what?
[03:19:42.374 --> 03:19:43.714]  Because it's only going to get worse.
[03:19:43.714 --> 03:19:45.355]  I mean, is it fun?
[03:19:45.355 --> 03:19:50.996]  I mean, the cops out there, is the petty power, the petty manhood rituals, is it fun?
[03:19:50.996 --> 03:19:52.236]  Do you like being used?
[03:19:52.236 --> 03:19:53.296]  Are you going to serve this?
[03:19:53.296 --> 03:19:55.057]  90% of you will.
[03:19:57.063 --> 03:20:00.086]  Unless you were conscious of the manipulation.
[03:20:00.086 --> 03:20:01.667]  We'll be right back with Alan White.
[03:20:01.667 --> 03:20:05.190]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[03:20:05.190 --> 03:20:07.212]  Now, going green can save money.

[03:21:01.983 --> 03:21:03.784]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[03:21:31.923 --> 03:21:33.704]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[03:22:01.900 --> 03:22:07.927]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:22:07.927 --> 03:22:13.814]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:22:13.814 --> 03:22:19.982]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:22:20.302 --> 03:22:22.263]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:22:22.263 --> 03:22:24.725]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:22:24.725 --> 03:22:35.693]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:22:37.927 --> 03:22:39.587]  It's not about left or right.
[03:22:39.587 --> 03:22:41.448]  It's about a one world government.
[03:22:41.448 --> 03:22:48.349]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:22:56.611 --> 03:22:58.192]  The Obama Deception.
[03:22:58.192 --> 03:22:59.372]  The people strike back.
[03:23:01.061 --> 03:23:09.763]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:23:09.763 --> 03:23:15.744]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[03:23:15.744 --> 03:23:22.845]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[03:23:22.845 --> 03:23:26.246]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:23:26.246 --> 03:23:28.486]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[03:24:03.537 --> 03:24:07.398]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:24:07.398 --> 03:24:10.479]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:24:10.479 --> 03:24:12.680]  Those are the two big twin motherships.
[03:24:12.680 --> 03:24:21.903]  We have the auxiliary attack frigates in the InfoWars, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com.
[03:24:21.903 --> 03:24:22.983]  What is the Endgame.com?
[03:24:24.693 --> 03:24:25.734]  The list goes on and on.
[03:24:25.734 --> 03:24:34.079]  FollowtheRepublic.com, TheObamaDeception.net, and about 20 other sites, or more.
[03:24:34.079 --> 03:24:39.823]  We did that because we get attacked and hacked over the years, and my rule is I start more websites when I'm attacked.
[03:24:39.823 --> 03:24:43.346]  And I mean bonafide real attacks.
[03:24:43.346 --> 03:24:45.067]  Alan Watt, always amazing to interview him.
[03:24:45.067 --> 03:24:46.968]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com.
[03:24:46.968 --> 03:24:49.450]  What are some of the other backup sites you've got as well, Alan?
[03:24:50.583 --> 03:24:54.966]  I've got a whole bunch there, because the same thing happens.
[03:24:54.966 --> 03:24:56.207]  In fact, it's through Yahoo.
[03:24:56.207 --> 03:25:01.351]  Yahoo pulls them once in a while for two weeks at a time, or three weeks.
[03:25:01.351 --> 03:25:05.594]  I'm the only person on the planet that can't find out what's wrong, what the problem is.
[03:25:06.337 --> 03:25:06.897]  Good.
[03:25:06.897 --> 03:25:08.417]  Okay, let's go to some phone calls.
[03:25:08.417 --> 03:25:10.338]  Let's talk to Robert in West Virginia.
[03:25:10.338 --> 03:25:11.378]  Robert, you're on the air.
[03:25:38.613 --> 03:25:41.355]  Okay, Shelly in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:25:41.355 --> 03:25:42.916]  Go ahead, Shelly.
[03:25:42.916 --> 03:25:52.261]  Hi Alex, I spoke to you a couple of days ago and I was telling you about my son that I just enrolled in school and I wanted to find out what I could do as far as the vaccine and everything.
[03:25:52.261 --> 03:25:54.582]  I live right outside of Houston.
[03:25:54.582 --> 03:25:59.385]  I went to my son's nurse yesterday and asked her for the vaccine exemption form.
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:01.681]  She said she has nothing like that.
[03:26:01.681 --> 03:26:03.443]  She didn't want to give me any information.
[03:26:03.443 --> 03:26:04.324]  She's a liar.
[03:26:04.324 --> 03:26:07.826]  She's basically... Okay, you have to go to the health department.
[03:26:07.826 --> 03:26:09.788]  Let's do this live on TV right now.
[03:26:09.788 --> 03:26:26.462]  Guys, Google Texas vaccine exemption form and we will be on the state health department and you just print it off and you mail it in and if the criminals at that school who get money for shooting your kid up, their federal funds are almost exclusively tied to that.
[03:26:26.462 --> 03:26:28.003]  It's so important the government wants that.
[03:26:29.338 --> 03:26:37.282]  That you then go in and you give it to them, and then they're open for massive criminal charges if they try to kick your child out.
[03:26:37.282 --> 03:26:42.704]  But see, their criminal charges on your child are for truancy when they kick them out.
[03:26:42.704 --> 03:26:46.306]  That's what they talk about arresting you for shots.
[03:26:46.306 --> 03:26:48.547]  They're total criminals!
[03:26:48.547 --> 03:26:51.408]  So, there it is, okay?
[03:26:51.408 --> 03:26:55.110]  There is the state of Texas, Texas vaccine exemption form,
[03:26:55.828 --> 03:26:59.050]  And you just Google that, and you can print the form off.
[03:26:59.050 --> 03:27:02.291]  Secure online request for exemption, Antman David.
[03:27:02.291 --> 03:27:09.435]  And there's copies of them online, but I guess here, the state's now making you ask to screw it up, but they've got to give it to you.
[03:27:09.435 --> 03:27:10.755]  I'm sorry, man, I don't mean to get mad.
[03:27:10.755 --> 03:27:12.876]  I'm just so tired of lying criminals.
[03:27:12.876 --> 03:27:18.619]  But again, this evil woman or man, they feel like it's good, like a death camp operator.
[03:27:18.619 --> 03:27:21.581]  Oh, they're helping by lying to you.
[03:27:21.581 --> 03:27:23.822]  And believe me, a school nurse knows they're lying.
[03:27:23.822 --> 03:27:24.302]  Alan what?
[03:27:25.310 --> 03:27:26.532]  Yes, they do.
[03:27:26.532 --> 03:27:30.036]  Some true believers in the profession are brainwashed themselves.
[03:27:30.036 --> 03:27:31.158]  In fact, the big boys say that.
[03:27:31.158 --> 03:27:34.382]  The first ones you have to brainwash are the ones who manage the rest of the public.
[03:27:35.109 --> 03:27:42.392]  And a lot of them truly believe it, but there's a lot of nurses, too, that understand that they've seen the effects of inoculations.
[03:27:42.392 --> 03:27:45.773]  Yeah, that's why close to 60% are saying no in New York.
[03:27:45.773 --> 03:27:46.273]  Shelley!
[03:27:46.273 --> 03:28:01.358]  In New York State, actually, this is the thing with New York State, they made it a policy, the big board that controls the health authority for New York State, a policy, and they said in the policy there will be no exemptions for religious or philosophical or even diabetic reasons.
[03:28:02.074 --> 03:28:05.436]  Uh, for the first time in their history they've actually got diabetics.
[03:28:05.436 --> 03:28:11.800]  Yeah, even if you're a doctor, because this is key, you can find an anti-vaccine doctor by googling it in any major city.
[03:28:11.800 --> 03:28:13.781]  If you're in a small town you have to go to a big city.
[03:28:13.781 --> 03:28:18.344]  They will give you a medical exemption and they admit on the flu shots hundreds of things.
[03:28:18.344 --> 03:28:24.208]  If you've got allergies you're not supposed to take shots because they admit that it is going to cause an autoimmune response.
[03:28:25.306 --> 03:28:28.969]  But now they're trying to say, we don't care if the medical doctor says no!
[03:28:28.969 --> 03:28:31.211]  We got SWAT teams who want to kill!
[03:28:31.211 --> 03:28:32.332]  They want blood!
[03:28:32.332 --> 03:28:33.853]  Take the cancer shot!
[03:28:33.853 --> 03:28:36.295]  Shelly, what are you facing right now?
[03:28:36.295 --> 03:28:43.541]  I called the immunization branch there in Austin, and the lady laughed at me yesterday on the phone.
[03:28:43.541 --> 03:28:45.562]  She said there is no exemption for them.
[03:28:45.562 --> 03:28:47.724]  I was asking specifically for the swine flu.
[03:28:48.548 --> 03:28:50.310]  Um, and she said that there is no form.
[03:28:50.310 --> 03:28:54.454]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, Obama's been on TV saying you don't have to take it.
[03:28:54.454 --> 03:28:55.635]  So she told you you have to?
[03:28:55.635 --> 03:29:01.781]  No, she said that it's not mandatory and there is no form that I can allow.
[03:29:01.781 --> 03:29:06.325]  But then let me guess, Houston's trying to force you to take it though?
[03:29:06.325 --> 03:29:07.186]  That I don't know.
[03:29:08.092 --> 03:29:09.573]  I'm hearing a lot.
[03:29:09.573 --> 03:29:17.897]  But you said that, ma'am, it's a general vaccine waiver form, so that when they try, well, it's all over Dallas Morning News, they're trying to make Texas kids take it.
[03:29:17.897 --> 03:29:27.963]  So see, Alan, what do you call these ring-around-the-rosie mind games, this blob of con artist play, where they'll go, you don't need an exemption, it's not mandatory, but you have to take it.
[03:29:27.963 --> 03:29:30.024]  What do you call that mind control, Alan?
[03:29:30.024 --> 03:29:32.085]  It's a form of double-think.
[03:29:32.085 --> 03:29:35.747]  When you get into this double-think, we can believe two opposing ideas at the same time.
[03:29:36.507 --> 03:29:38.388]  Then you can't think rationally for yourselves.
[03:29:38.388 --> 03:29:39.928]  You give up and go along with them.
[03:29:39.928 --> 03:29:41.249]  That's what most folk do.
[03:29:41.249 --> 03:29:42.309]  They give up and go along.
[03:29:42.309 --> 03:29:42.709]  Yeah.
[03:29:42.709 --> 03:29:43.209]  Stay there, Alan.
[03:29:43.209 --> 03:29:44.990]  I want to hear more from you, Mark, and others.
[03:29:44.990 --> 03:29:46.491]  Shelley, look.
[03:29:46.491 --> 03:29:48.211]  The General Vaccine Forum.
[03:29:48.211 --> 03:29:50.432]  Your kid's not taking vaccines, okay?
[03:29:50.432 --> 03:29:51.973]  Period.
[03:29:51.973 --> 03:29:53.373]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.373 --> 03:29:55.894]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.894 --> 03:29:58.575]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.152 --> 03:30:05.394]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.394 --> 03:30:07.394]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.394 --> 03:30:15.917]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.917 --> 03:30:21.459]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.459 --> 03:30:23.080]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.320 --> 03:30:29.845]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.845 --> 03:30:40.894]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.894 --> 03:30:41.674]  That's right.
[03:30:41.674 --> 03:30:44.236]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:30:44.236 --> 03:30:45.818]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[03:30:47.759 --> 03:30:48.379]  We're good to go.
[03:31:02.481 --> 03:31:08.288]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:08.288 --> 03:31:15.876]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:31:15.876 --> 03:31:22.063]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.503 --> 03:31:24.464]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.464 --> 03:31:26.965]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:31:26.965 --> 03:31:37.950]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.530 --> 03:31:40.211]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:40.211 --> 03:31:42.072]  It's about a one world government.
[03:31:42.072 --> 03:31:48.977]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:31:57.242 --> 03:31:58.823]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.823 --> 03:32:00.024]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.823 --> 03:32:05.706]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[03:32:05.706 --> 03:32:15.874]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[03:32:25.561 --> 03:32:28.141]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[03:32:28.141 --> 03:32:33.342]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[03:33:01.494 --> 03:33:01.634]  Hey!
[03:33:08.954 --> 03:33:11.475]  Alright, I didn't mean to go off into a rant.
[03:33:11.475 --> 03:33:16.596]  I was just talking to one of my producers, one of the radio guys, Rob Dew, about how they
[03:33:35.091 --> 03:33:41.981]  And his wife's in education, how they tried for months to get the exemption form and they would laugh and say it doesn't exist.
[03:33:41.981 --> 03:33:45.526]  Up until a month ago, you could always just print it off online.
[03:33:45.526 --> 03:33:47.409]  Now I guess they make you get one from them.
[03:33:47.409 --> 03:33:48.311]  They're real bastards.
[03:33:51.252 --> 03:33:53.555]  Going back to Alan Watt before we continue with calls.
[03:33:53.555 --> 03:33:56.319]  Yeah, there's always these little ring-around-the-rosie games.
[03:33:56.319 --> 03:33:57.500]  It's in the Dallas Morning News.
[03:33:57.500 --> 03:34:02.166]  They're kicking kids out if they don't take the regular shot, seasonal flu, and the new one.
[03:34:02.166 --> 03:34:04.870]  I mean, I showed Dallas Morning News yesterday.
[03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:07.373]  Austin's announcing it, but there's no law.
[03:34:07.373 --> 03:34:09.396]  They're saying, you don't have to, but you have to.
[03:34:10.149 --> 03:34:14.710]  And then you say, well, I want an exemption form, and they laugh at you and say, you don't have to, honey.
[03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:16.990]  I mean, this is just so sick!
[03:34:16.990 --> 03:34:22.191]  And these locals, they always get like a little piggy face, a little demonic smile.
[03:34:22.191 --> 03:34:25.632]  What is that programming, where they revel in abusing people?
[03:34:25.632 --> 03:34:27.452]  They revel in lying?
[03:34:27.452 --> 03:34:34.453]  Yeah, what you've got, really, is what has been said about the Soviet system and the hero worship of the man at the top.
[03:34:34.453 --> 03:34:37.354]  The same with the Nazi regime in Germany.
[03:34:38.693 --> 03:34:44.678]  What they found was that all the officers down below are sadomasochists, and this is how power works.
[03:34:44.678 --> 03:34:51.043]  It's a sadomasochistic thing that attracts psychopathic types into those positions, but you're generally the only one to go into them.
[03:34:51.946 --> 03:34:59.772]  And they worship the person above them with power, and they despise the person beneath them who has less power than themselves.
[03:34:59.772 --> 03:35:11.901]  That's how simply it works with sadomasochism, and you'll always have the strange sadomasochistic authoritarianism when you get into politics, and right down to local politics even, any authority.
[03:35:11.901 --> 03:35:15.984]  This is the very thing that Carol Young warned the public about back in the 50s.
[03:35:17.645 --> 03:35:31.460]  He talked about the Iron Curtain across Germany, but he also said, he says, I see an Iron Curtain of massive bureaucracies building up with governmental agencies stifling and strangling the freedom of the whole planet.
[03:35:31.460 --> 03:35:34.363]  He understood what was coming down the pike back then.
[03:35:34.363 --> 03:35:38.808]  Many of his generation did, in fact, because they were involved in meeting high-level people.
[03:35:39.468 --> 03:35:40.529]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:36:04.446 --> 03:36:08.870]  Since they don't have a choice, they learn to love it and love the defendant.
[03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:12.913]  And so when you say, hey, the banks just stole $23.7 trillion.
[03:36:12.913 --> 03:36:15.556]  We got to pay it back with interest.
[03:36:15.556 --> 03:36:18.859]  They just laugh and will say, I'm part of the power structure.
[03:36:18.859 --> 03:36:25.745]  And it's almost like a five-year-old dressing up like they're Luke Skywalker, dressing up like they're
[03:36:26.624 --> 03:36:28.948]  You know, some hero.
[03:36:28.948 --> 03:36:34.937]  It's like the public are eternal children and they imagine things.
[03:36:34.937 --> 03:36:37.241]  They're delusional.
[03:36:38.010 --> 03:36:42.754]  And I never had a view of myself as something special or wonderful or good.
[03:36:42.754 --> 03:36:45.676]  I'm just a person that has my instincts intact.
[03:36:45.676 --> 03:36:53.441]  And, you know, having a bunch of psychos writing books about how they're killing me with vaccines and stuff in the water, and then I can see the evidence they're doing it?
[03:36:53.441 --> 03:36:59.866]  I mean, if they write hundreds of books about how they're killing us and how it's a scientific dictatorship,
[03:37:00.794 --> 03:37:06.577]  Wouldn't there be something wrong with me if I didn't, as a red-blooded male, not stand up for my species?
[03:37:06.577 --> 03:37:07.978]  Absolutely.
[03:37:07.978 --> 03:37:11.320]  Against a power-tripping group that's playing God?
[03:37:11.320 --> 03:37:12.441]  Absolutely.
[03:37:12.441 --> 03:37:21.286]  And part of the key of obedience, as I say, Stanford and other universities are into these experiments all the time around obedience or the CIA involved with them, obviously.
[03:37:21.286 --> 03:37:25.989]  And what they find is, with the more power they accumulate in any agency,
[03:37:27.063 --> 03:37:35.729]  In this age of masochistic power structure, they begin to despise the ordinary people who begin to cow under authority.
[03:37:35.729 --> 03:37:43.055]  The more the people cow under authority, the more they're despised as almost weaklings, and eventually hated by those in power.
[03:37:43.055 --> 03:37:47.358]  I've always said it's like a farmer breaking their legs.
[03:37:47.358 --> 03:37:51.981]  If a cow falls to the ground, then he starts kicking it because it can't get up.
[03:37:51.981 --> 03:37:53.162]  That's the very system.
[03:37:53.712 --> 03:38:03.237]  Well, I think that one of the most effective ways to attack it is to just show people the matrix of false reality and reach out to police, military, bureaucrats and go,
[03:38:15.490 --> 03:38:18.792]  You know, your little cousin just died of cancer at 22.
[03:38:18.792 --> 03:38:19.892]  That's not normal.
[03:38:19.892 --> 03:38:21.473]  Here's some statistics.
[03:38:21.473 --> 03:38:22.893]  Do you know what's in the water?
[03:38:22.893 --> 03:38:24.734]  Do you know what's in the shots?
[03:38:24.734 --> 03:38:30.397]  Here's AP admitting they're giving everyone polio with the polio vaccine.
[03:38:30.397 --> 03:38:34.598]  And you're not going to listen now because you have defenses up.
[03:38:34.598 --> 03:38:38.200]  But deep down in your instincts, you know I'm telling you the truth.
[03:38:38.200 --> 03:38:39.501]  You're being manipulated.
[03:38:39.501 --> 03:38:44.903]  And I found that six months down the road, a year down the road, they then wake up.
[03:38:45.994 --> 03:38:55.539]  And just showing them how they're not in the power structure like they think they are, how they're being attacked as well.
[03:38:55.539 --> 03:39:05.864]  It was interesting to see this new world order is to go through a series of changes, including the riot phase for 30 odd years as they bring down the food supply.
[03:39:05.864 --> 03:39:12.047]  And then the United Nations takes over the distribution of food to all the different regions, as they call these sections of the world.
[03:39:13.027 --> 03:39:27.791]  And they say in their own writings in the United Nations that they'll gradually reduce the ration to each area every year and it's up to you to bring your population down to accommodate and use the resources that are given to you.
[03:39:27.791 --> 03:39:34.473]  This is all their plan and this is hell on earth they're bringing in step by step and of course the reduction of population via
[03:39:35.558 --> 03:39:41.819]  Mass, literally, it's, um, we're being killed off by inoculations and they know this.
[03:39:41.819 --> 03:39:54.782]  And that's all stated and they all brag about it and you'll tell some mom and she'll arrogantly laugh at you, take her kid who already looks like a zombie and just shoot him up with some more and then they'll look at you with pleasure.
[03:39:54.782 --> 03:39:56.443]  You crazy nut!
[03:39:56.443 --> 03:39:57.863]  It doesn't matter if you just quoted
[03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:59.830]  State Department memorandum 200.
[03:39:59.830 --> 03:40:00.751]  Yes.
[03:40:00.751 --> 03:40:02.911]  It doesn't matter if you're quoting UN documents.
[03:40:02.911 --> 03:40:03.711]  It doesn't matter.
[03:40:03.711 --> 03:40:05.712]  They don't care.
[03:40:05.712 --> 03:40:11.453]  And then when their kid dies, they'll wear a little cancer ribbon and cry, and it's like a celebrity thing.
[03:40:11.453 --> 03:40:13.674]  Oh, your kid died too!
[03:40:13.674 --> 03:40:14.934]  Ooh!
[03:40:14.934 --> 03:40:15.534]  Ooh!
[03:40:15.534 --> 03:40:18.195]  You know, because it's all about euthanizing everybody.
[03:40:18.195 --> 03:40:19.635]  That's what this is all about.
[03:40:19.635 --> 03:40:23.036]  It is euthanasia, and it's bacterial warfare.
[03:40:23.036 --> 03:40:24.576]  It's viral warfare.
[03:40:24.576 --> 03:40:26.657]  It's bio-warfare, carefully designed.
[03:40:27.497 --> 03:40:28.078]  I don't know.
[03:40:37.802 --> 03:40:45.383]  DNA and RNA and so on, recombine within the body and infect the cells of the person and cause cancers down the road.
[03:40:45.383 --> 03:40:46.264]  They understand it.
[03:40:46.264 --> 03:40:54.525]  Well, they grow it in the exact type of monkeys and fetal tissue that have the cancer virus that's most deadly in it.
[03:40:54.525 --> 03:41:04.667]  Well, actually, they've stated now that they're actually using, especially for this new swine flu, rather than use the eggs, chicken eggs and so on, for doing so, which also contains thousands of foreign bacteria.
[03:41:04.687 --> 03:41:14.735]  They're using cancer virus instead of the dead baby retinas, or the green monkey kidneys, or the other growth mediums.
[03:41:14.735 --> 03:41:15.475]  You're right.
[03:41:15.475 --> 03:41:17.797]  They're using cancer virus.
[03:41:17.797 --> 03:41:20.579]  That's what they say, because the cancer virus is the survivors.
[03:41:20.579 --> 03:41:23.402]  They're using that as an adjective.
[03:41:23.402 --> 03:41:25.023]  Is it that sweet?
[03:41:25.023 --> 03:41:26.624]  I'm going to move the calls quickly now.
[03:41:26.624 --> 03:41:27.865]  Mark in Oregon.
[03:41:27.865 --> 03:41:28.626]  You're on the air.
[03:41:28.626 --> 03:41:29.006]  Go ahead.
[03:41:30.071 --> 03:41:31.332]  Hi Alex and Alan.
[03:41:31.332 --> 03:41:32.594]  Honored to speak with you.
[03:41:32.594 --> 03:41:34.135]  Thank you for your great information.
[03:41:34.135 --> 03:41:37.499]  Thank you for your great wisdom, even.
[03:41:37.499 --> 03:41:45.447]  Alex, on Monday's show, you had mentioned that there were 10 million doses of the flu mist being sent out into the country on Monday.
[03:41:45.447 --> 03:41:48.330]  They will have arrived, or probably have arrived, at the destination by now.
[03:41:48.330 --> 03:41:52.414]  I'm sure many of the destinations that it's arriving to are the Walmart stores.
[03:41:53.155 --> 03:42:17.445]  Let me be clear, they said last Friday that 200,000 were going to Tennessee, Indiana, and Texas, and that then by the end of the next week, 10 million more would start flowing, and then they admit there's been no testing of the H1N1, and that they're making people sign secrecy forms and waiving their rights when they take the nasal.
[03:42:17.445 --> 03:42:18.225]  Yes.
[03:42:18.225 --> 03:42:20.266]  You also reported, Alex, the Mayo Clinic
[03:42:20.788 --> 03:42:25.491]  Has come out and said that the flu mist will be much more contagious to other people.
[03:42:25.491 --> 03:42:34.997]  It takes 10 to 20 days, as I understand it at this point, for the actual symptoms to manifest in someone who has received an injected or a flu mist vaccination.
[03:42:34.997 --> 03:42:47.425]  Now, I think the time clock has already started on this, and that the actual mass murder genocide that this operation consists of, and it is not a drill.
[03:42:47.425 --> 03:42:48.506]  Absolutely not a drill.
[03:42:49.002 --> 03:42:54.144]  It's set in motion now as to where it's going to follow through with the actual sickness itself.
[03:42:54.144 --> 03:42:58.646]  And people are going to become so sick and weak that they're going to accept martial law.
[03:42:58.646 --> 03:43:01.628]  And I think this is the first stage of the operation.
[03:43:01.628 --> 03:43:06.070]  We're going to find out by the end of October.
[03:43:07.088 --> 03:43:18.064]  Early November, whether it's meant to mutate and really be deadly, or if this is just setting the precedent for us to go under World Health Organization rules and to set the precedent to take the shots as they've stated.
[03:43:18.064 --> 03:43:20.187]  We know it's at least that bad.
[03:43:20.187 --> 03:43:21.669]  Alan Watt, what do you think's going on?
[03:43:22.834 --> 03:43:23.374]  It's true.
[03:43:23.374 --> 03:43:25.595]  I think it fulfills both purposes.
[03:43:25.595 --> 03:43:28.935]  You become a human incubator when you take on this stuff.
[03:43:28.935 --> 03:43:30.696]  You are now the new egg, if you like.
[03:43:30.696 --> 03:43:33.196]  You're the new reactor as it breathes within you.
[03:43:33.196 --> 03:43:36.717]  And admit you shed the virus to all those around you.
[03:43:36.717 --> 03:43:38.818]  There's no doubt about that.
[03:43:38.818 --> 03:43:43.819]  And what's interesting to me is putting this kind of thing into a mist form.
[03:43:44.602 --> 03:43:45.243]  I think so.
[03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:06.522]  Right into the lung area, which might cause you to die.
[03:44:06.522 --> 03:44:15.507]  For those that don't know, that's the autoimmune storm of how the 1918 killed tens of millions.
[03:44:15.507 --> 03:44:20.730]  It's the autoimmune response to the virus that kills you in hours with fluid.
[03:44:20.730 --> 03:44:25.672]  And now we're getting reports they're covering it up, that people are taking it and collapsing.
[03:44:25.672 --> 03:44:28.674]  And so, Alan, I want to be very clear about what you just said.
[03:44:28.674 --> 03:44:30.355]  They admit in the literature
[03:44:31.105 --> 03:44:31.326]  Yeah.
[03:44:51.860 --> 03:44:53.844]  Yes, it's very obvious.
[03:44:53.844 --> 03:45:00.437]  And again, it's twofold, as you say, that it is to train us to take the annual shots and boosters for the rest of our lives.
[03:45:00.437 --> 03:45:02.400]  That's what they said at the World Health Organization 2006 meeting.
[03:45:06.255 --> 03:45:14.120]  Alright, I hope you're wrong, Mark, but we at least know they're setting the precedent for the big soft kill that's coming, but we're going to find out the next few months here, buddy.
[03:45:14.120 --> 03:45:15.661]  If it doesn't look good, I'll say that.
[03:45:15.661 --> 03:45:19.684]  I mean, they admit it's live virus they're putting into 10 million morons.
[03:45:19.684 --> 03:45:22.125]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Arkansas.
[03:45:22.125 --> 03:45:23.126]  John, you're on the air.
[03:45:23.126 --> 03:45:23.546]  Go ahead.
[03:45:23.546 --> 03:45:25.007]  Hi, Alex.
[03:45:25.007 --> 03:45:26.108]  This is John.
[03:45:26.108 --> 03:45:32.272]  I spoke to you about the police stopping me and trying to get me to take the shot.
[03:45:33.939 --> 03:45:35.640]  Yeah, tell us about that again.
[03:45:35.640 --> 03:45:39.060]  Expand on that.
[03:45:39.060 --> 03:45:46.562]  Yes, I was on my way home from a girlfriend's house and a police officer here at Little Rock stopped me and he was like, hey, how you doing?
[03:45:46.562 --> 03:45:48.142]  And I was like, it's a little late to be out.
[03:45:48.142 --> 03:45:49.103]  And I was like, yeah, it's okay.
[03:45:49.103 --> 03:45:50.643]  I'm just coming from my girlfriend's house.
[03:45:50.643 --> 03:45:51.643]  Oh, it's a free country.
[03:45:51.643 --> 03:45:53.804]  You know, the guy's got to ask you why you're out at night.
[03:45:53.804 --> 03:45:54.764]  You know, you're a slave.
[03:45:54.764 --> 03:45:55.104]  Go ahead.
[03:45:56.121 --> 03:45:59.583]  And he was like, so have you, um, taken your, uh, gotten your flu shot yet?
[03:45:59.583 --> 03:46:00.404]  I said, no.
[03:46:00.404 --> 03:46:01.905]  And he said, why not?
[03:46:01.905 --> 03:46:07.808]  I said, because that's government propaganda and it contains mercury, which kills you.
[03:46:07.808 --> 03:46:09.229]  And he looked at me kind of crazy.
[03:46:09.229 --> 03:46:13.532]  So he said, so you're, you're going to probably be spat out some new world order crap, huh?
[03:46:13.532 --> 03:46:17.395]  I said, yeah, I was kind of thinking that and coming to tell you to fuck off right about now.
[03:46:17.395 --> 03:46:19.276]  I'm going to let you go, sir.
[03:46:19.276 --> 03:46:22.238]  I understand that happened to you, but we really need to remember, we have a lot of children listening.
[03:46:22.238 --> 03:46:22.718]  Okay, buddy.
[03:46:23.733 --> 03:46:26.674]  Uh, no more for that caller.
[03:46:26.674 --> 03:46:28.375]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[03:46:28.375 --> 03:46:29.675]  Mike, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:46:29.675 --> 03:46:32.856]  Hey guys, can you hear me alright?
[03:46:32.856 --> 03:46:34.557]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:46:34.557 --> 03:46:42.579]  Um, I've just been, this is in regards to, I guess, more of the eugenic kind of stuff that you guys are talking about.
[03:46:42.579 --> 03:46:50.682]  I studied Soviet Union history and politics when I was in university, and we covered the Aral Sea.
[03:46:52.555 --> 03:47:07.083]  A lot of the genetic mutations and aberrations that resulted from the pesticides and other stuff that was running off through the irrigation ditches of the farmers.
[03:47:07.083 --> 03:47:12.986]  I'm just curious to know if a lot of the similar stuff is being put into this kind of GMO foods and
[03:47:15.597 --> 03:47:17.557]  Incredibly good point.
[03:47:17.557 --> 03:47:30.142]  Let me briefly say that they've done studies where over 90 percent, I want to say 97, you can pull it up, of people in India of the sewage systems have the SV40 live cancer virus.
[03:47:30.142 --> 03:47:31.903]  They don't just inject this in people.
[03:47:31.903 --> 03:47:36.104]  It then spreads and mutates in us as incubators, as Alan was saying.
[03:47:36.104 --> 03:47:40.226]  Now, I've interviewed genetic engineer after genetic engineer, guys making millions a year.
[03:47:40.746 --> 03:48:00.792]  Guys who were running whole facilities, and they would find that they would be told by other engineers, they were just running plants, to make the potato this way, the tomato that way, insert this gene, and they noticed, we've had them on the show over and over again, that it was a combination change that would change other things and produce a pharmacological crop
[03:48:01.368 --> 03:48:07.873]  That's what it's called, pharmacological crops, that would also sterilize all the guinea pigs and rats they tested it on.
[03:48:07.873 --> 03:48:18.481]  And so, yes, and that's what they've said, they're going to have food crops, they already have them, with vaccines in them, with live viruses in them, and that the very GMO food, it's already going on.
[03:48:18.481 --> 03:48:19.682]  Alan, what?
[03:48:19.682 --> 03:48:24.606]  Yes, I also have the information that's often websited by the United Nations that they're into crops.
[03:48:25.531 --> 03:48:35.756]  For the last 15 years, for third world countries especially, all kinds of stuff, including corn, that would actually help sterilize the people and bring down the population rate.
[03:48:35.756 --> 03:48:44.760]  You find Rockefeller himself is in charge of the rice campaign, the Golden Rice campaign, that's getting modified rice too, for all these countries.
[03:48:44.760 --> 03:48:48.361]  It's now being imported back into the US and other countries too.
[03:48:48.361 --> 03:48:51.443]  This stuff also was designed to lower the sperm in the males, etc.
[03:48:55.103 --> 03:48:59.764]  That's stuff on their own side.
[03:48:59.764 --> 03:49:04.665]  Allen, I was going to do some financial news in the final segment, but I want to hold you to the very end so we can take a few more calls.
[03:49:04.665 --> 03:49:05.705]  Are you game for that?
[03:49:05.705 --> 03:49:06.325]  Yes.
[03:49:06.325 --> 03:49:07.506]  Ten more minutes, okay.
[03:49:07.506 --> 03:49:08.946]  Let's take another call here.
[03:49:08.946 --> 03:49:10.986]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[03:49:10.986 --> 03:49:13.367]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:49:13.367 --> 03:49:14.167]  We'll just talk to Mike.
[03:49:14.167 --> 03:49:15.547]  Lloyd in Connecticut, sorry.
[03:49:15.547 --> 03:49:16.187]  Lloyd, go ahead.
[03:49:16.187 --> 03:49:17.728]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:49:17.728 --> 03:49:18.648]  Good.
[03:49:18.648 --> 03:49:23.429]  A friend of mine's wife works for a big HMO, you know.
[03:49:24.582 --> 03:49:34.637]  In three years ago they had a meeting and they discussed the flu and her husband got so paranoid he went out and bought dried food.
[03:49:34.637 --> 03:49:40.326]  So, you know, how can they know that far in advance unless it's planned, you know?
[03:49:41.036 --> 03:49:49.885]  Sir, in January, we had emergency managers on and documents from major states where they were saying in November, December, millions were going to die.
[03:49:49.885 --> 03:49:51.006]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[03:49:51.006 --> 03:49:56.311]  The feds were telling police departments, the citizens will attack you in the winter.
[03:49:56.311 --> 03:49:59.194]  So, they're clearly getting ready for something.
[03:49:59.194 --> 03:50:00.455]  They're testing the water?
[03:50:00.455 --> 03:50:01.716]  I don't know.
[03:50:01.716 --> 03:50:04.038]  But yes, this is all pre-planned.
[03:50:04.038 --> 03:50:04.479]  Alan, what?
[03:50:05.191 --> 03:50:06.792]  There's no doubt about it, too.
[03:50:06.792 --> 03:50:18.456]  In fact, they were into talking John Holdren, when he wrote that book, Ecoscience, along with the other big eugenicists and ecologists, which we know like the population experts.
[03:50:18.456 --> 03:50:24.339]  They admitted then that they had to find ways of putting things in the water and the food, and that was, what, 30-odd years ago.
[03:50:24.339 --> 03:50:29.541]  And you can go further back, again, into the Harvard studies, talking about the same thing, and Russell's putting stuff in the food.
[03:50:29.541 --> 03:50:32.302]  But Bertrand Russell, Lord Bertrand Russell in charge,
[03:50:41.327 --> 03:50:55.335]  Many cases, folks, when these hospitals kill your family, your kids, just remember who did it, the New World Order, they think you're stupid, they think you're not going to notice what's happening.
[03:50:55.335 --> 03:50:58.457]  Final segment, Lloyd, stay there for comments from you as well, we'll be right back.
[03:51:02.142 --> 03:51:06.425]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[03:51:06.425 --> 03:51:09.686]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[03:51:09.686 --> 03:51:17.491]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[03:51:17.751 --> 03:51:19.993]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[03:51:19.993 --> 03:51:22.355]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[03:51:22.355 --> 03:51:29.220]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[03:51:29.220 --> 03:51:35.406]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[03:51:35.406 --> 03:51:38.008]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[03:51:38.008 --> 03:51:45.394]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high quality health supplements.

[03:52:02.071 --> 03:52:08.096]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.096 --> 03:52:13.981]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:13.981 --> 03:52:20.147]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.487 --> 03:52:22.449]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.449 --> 03:52:24.912]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:24.912 --> 03:52:35.824]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.092 --> 03:52:39.754]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.754 --> 03:52:41.615]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:41.615 --> 03:52:48.541]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.541 --> 03:52:56.808]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.808 --> 03:52:58.370]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.370 --> 03:52:59.551]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.294 --> 03:53:02.575]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:53:02.575 --> 03:53:08.182]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:53:08.182 --> 03:53:13.207]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:53:13.207 --> 03:53:18.233]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:53:18.753 --> 03:53:23.996]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:53:23.996 --> 03:53:31.099]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:53:31.099 --> 03:53:32.220]  And here's the best part.
[03:53:32.220 --> 03:53:38.583]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:53:38.903 --> 03:53:42.085]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:53:42.085 --> 03:53:44.306]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:53:44.306 --> 03:53:45.187]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:53:45.187 --> 03:53:45.427]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:53:45.427 --> 03:53:48.889]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:53:48.889 --> 03:53:50.630]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:54:08.386 --> 03:54:09.886]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[03:54:09.886 --> 03:54:10.627]  to 3 p.m.
[03:54:10.627 --> 03:54:11.047]  Central.
[03:54:11.047 --> 03:54:18.968]  We're here just trying to warn people and like Alan Watts said, the biggest issue is to realize they're not talking about killing us in all these publications.
[03:54:18.968 --> 03:54:20.609]  They're doing it.
[03:54:20.609 --> 03:54:23.969]  And you've got to face that horror and read their own statements and they've been caught.
[03:54:23.969 --> 03:54:25.370]  The UN's been caught.
[03:54:25.370 --> 03:54:28.450]  The time for games is over.
[03:54:28.450 --> 03:54:29.191]  Get aggressive.
[03:54:29.191 --> 03:54:30.551]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[03:54:31.434 --> 03:54:33.536]  Go to TheMakers.com is Alan Watts' website.
[03:54:33.536 --> 03:54:35.838]  He is a big part of the new film, Fall of the Republic, Volume 1.
[03:54:35.838 --> 03:54:39.240]  I hope you pre-order it, because it's going to be shipped out and the order is received.
[03:54:39.240 --> 03:54:42.063]  It's coming out in just 13 days.
[03:54:42.063 --> 03:54:45.766]  Alright, let's go ahead and Lloyd in Connecticut, are you still there?
[03:54:45.766 --> 03:54:46.747]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[03:54:46.747 --> 03:54:51.731]  So you're making the point that, yeah, the internal people are freaking out about the flu.
[03:54:51.731 --> 03:54:52.091]  Go ahead.
[03:54:52.091 --> 03:54:59.177]  You know, when I was a kid, my old man, he wouldn't let us get a shot because everybody in his neighborhood
[03:54:59.795 --> 03:55:05.718]  When he grew up, took the polio vaccine, and they were damaged by it, and he was terrified of it.
[03:55:05.718 --> 03:55:10.380]  And, uh, I haven't... I've never had the flu, and I've never taken a shot.
[03:55:10.380 --> 03:55:13.922]  So... I don't really think they do anything at all.
[03:55:13.922 --> 03:55:16.563]  I think it's just, like, smoke and mirrors, you know?
[03:55:16.563 --> 03:55:20.805]  Well, it'd be nice if it was just a scam, but it actually does do something.
[03:55:20.805 --> 03:55:22.426]  I appreciate your call.
[03:55:22.426 --> 03:55:23.967]  Alan, briefly tell him what it does to him.
[03:55:24.893 --> 03:55:25.714]  Well, there's no doubt.
[03:55:25.714 --> 03:55:33.838]  From their own writings, they admit at the top there's thousands of viruses they haven't even identified yet in every shot.
[03:55:33.838 --> 03:55:36.400]  Every shot for everything that they've ever given you.
[03:55:36.400 --> 03:55:40.742]  And this is the recent explanation that they've given out at the top.
[03:55:41.690 --> 03:55:47.413]  But they do know that the ones they have given you definitely not only can, but do cause cancers.
[03:55:47.413 --> 03:55:54.358]  They do destroy your... Well, the inventor of the polio vaccine was in a CBC piece admitting it gave everybody cancer.
[03:55:54.358 --> 03:55:55.178]  But it's worse.
[03:55:55.178 --> 03:56:02.302]  Five years ago, the FDA approved, so did England and so did Canada, they spray live viruses.
[03:56:02.302 --> 03:56:05.484]  In Latin, it means bacteria-eating virus.
[03:56:05.484 --> 03:56:06.605]  I can't pronounce it.
[03:56:06.605 --> 03:56:07.765]  Bacteriophages, yeah.
[03:56:09.338 --> 03:56:10.259]  Phalange, yeah.
[03:56:10.259 --> 03:56:20.268]  But they grow in these big vaccine tanks with thousands of other viruses, so they spray vaccine, live vaccine, on your meat now.
[03:56:20.268 --> 03:56:22.389]  Yeah, yeah, bacteriophages.
[03:56:22.389 --> 03:56:25.152]  And actually they can kill off most bacteria.
[03:56:25.152 --> 03:56:30.436]  The Soviet Union didn't bother with antibiotics because they had bacteriophages since the 1930s.
[03:56:31.637 --> 03:56:38.399]  That was bought over, that whole, all their pets were bought over by a New York company and they've withheld them from the public.
[03:56:38.399 --> 03:56:43.161]  They don't want to give us something that will kill off bacterial infections.
[03:56:43.161 --> 03:56:45.422]  They want us to die off, that's why they bought the pets.
[03:56:45.422 --> 03:56:49.603]  And instead it kills the good bacteria so everybody then has intestinal problems.
[03:56:49.603 --> 03:56:50.283]  Yes.
[03:56:50.283 --> 03:56:52.204]  All done scientifically.
[03:56:52.204 --> 03:56:54.825]  Let's cram in one final caller here.
[03:56:54.825 --> 03:56:56.545]  Let's talk to Cheryl in Canada.
[03:56:56.545 --> 03:56:57.786]  You're on the air, go ahead Cheryl.
[03:56:58.610 --> 03:57:00.971]  Mr. Jones, Mr. Watt, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[03:57:00.971 --> 03:57:04.092]  I have two subject matters I'm hoping you can comment on.
[03:57:04.092 --> 03:57:04.813]  Oh, we got a minute and a half.
[03:57:04.813 --> 03:57:11.075]  A great amount of money, or sorry, a great amount of gold disappears out of one of the mints in Canada.
[03:57:11.075 --> 03:57:14.096]  Can you speculate as to why?
[03:57:14.096 --> 03:57:15.597]  Disappears, poof, everywhere.
[03:57:15.597 --> 03:57:20.139]  Well, a lot of foreign governments are recalling their gold from the West right now, Alan Watt.
[03:57:21.207 --> 03:57:23.909]  Yes, and to be honest with you, we'll never know what happens.
[03:57:23.909 --> 03:57:29.894]  I mean, I watched a documentary where the guys who found the Titanic followed the North Sea route from the U.S.
[03:57:30.672 --> 03:57:31.372]  We're good to go.
[03:57:53.723 --> 03:57:55.283]  Yeah, they just do whatever they want.
[03:57:55.283 --> 03:57:57.684]  The public walks around like a bunch of zombies.
[03:57:57.684 --> 03:57:58.364]  We're out of time.
[03:57:58.364 --> 03:58:01.445]  I appreciate your call, Cheryl and Steve and others.
[03:58:01.445 --> 03:58:04.126]  Call me back tomorrow and then, of course, Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:04.126 --> 03:58:06.846]  Alan, great job in Follow the Republic.
[03:58:06.846 --> 03:58:08.547]  Great job in everything you're doing.
[03:58:08.547 --> 03:58:11.307]  Motion supports you over there at CuttingTheMatrix.com.
[03:58:11.307 --> 03:58:12.868]  We'll talk to you again real soon.
[03:58:12.868 --> 03:58:14.608]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[03:58:14.608 --> 03:58:15.568]  You bet.
[03:58:15.568 --> 03:58:18.229]  And I want to thank all of our wonderful sponsors.
[03:58:19.308 --> 03:58:20.889]  As well that it made the show possible.
[03:58:20.889 --> 03:58:30.255]  I want to thank you in there, Nihart, Hartman, Harmon, everybody else that is in there doing a great job.
[03:58:30.255 --> 03:58:38.981]  The new trailer, the TV Mind Control trailer for Fall of the Republic is live at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[03:58:38.981 --> 03:58:40.562]  Be sure and check it out.
[03:58:40.562 --> 03:58:41.402]  God bless you all.
[03:58:41.402 --> 03:58:47.026]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:47.706 --> 03:58:51.370]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[03:58:51.370 --> 03:58:54.754]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.754 --> 03:58:58.378]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.378 --> 03:59:02.963]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.963 --> 03:59:04.365]  These emergency backup systems
[03:59:04.565 --> 03:59:07.487]  We'll provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[03:59:07.487 --> 03:59:13.613]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.613 --> 03:59:17.236]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.236 --> 03:59:22.060]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.060 --> 03:59:28.625]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.625 --> 03:59:30.567]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.047 --> 03:59:32.047]  Coast to coast and in your face!
[03:59:32.047 --> 03:59:34.688]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
