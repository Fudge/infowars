[00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:06.132]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.132 --> 00:00:07.893]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:09.654]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:11.234]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:12.795]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:16.977]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:21.059]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.105 --> 00:00:38.930]  Well, gold is at $1,041 an ounce right now.
[00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:47.457]  Bet a lot of you that bought from Midas Resources yesterday at the $9.91 level were happy when it was trading at $1.20.
[00:00:47.457 --> 00:00:48.738]  You know why that's happening?
[00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:51.861]  Because they're having open discussions in the councils of government
[00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:54.955]  Around the world, how to kill the dollar.
[00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.776]  They have come to a consensus.
[00:00:56.776 --> 00:01:03.020]  I have a stack of mainstream financial reports here, mainstream news, saying, oh, we've decided to kill the dollar.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.782]  We're just deciding how to do it without the American people rioting.
[00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:17.448]  We're just trying to get more riot police in place and more FEMA camps in place and more cops that will help billy club their people's heads in while the foreign banks destroy America.
[00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:21.070]  Then the cops will wake up completely bankrupt, but hey, that's how they roll.
[00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:26.165]  And so, we're going to be talking about that today.
[00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:29.267]  You know, I try to remain calm here on the show.
[00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:35.371]  And I try to have, you know, what you call controlled rage.
[00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:39.675]  But when I control my rage, I just start getting a smart mouth.
[00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:40.675]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:44.060]  I don't hate the police.
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.121]  I don't hate the military.
[00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:49.425]  In fact, I have a lot of family that are police and military or have been police or military.
[00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:52.488]  I know they're by and large good people, macho guys.
[00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:56.492]  They'd be fun to go deer hunting with, you know, in Colorado.
[00:01:56.492 --> 00:01:58.554]  But I want to tell you something.
[00:01:58.554 --> 00:02:01.918]  You're going to wish to, you know what, you'd have done something about this.
[00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:04.180]  And that goes for the American people in general as well.
[00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:07.555]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:08.535]  I mean, I'm gonna be honest with you.
[00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:25.692]  Watching a bunch of corrupt banks rape the hell out of my country, watch a classical police state with police chiefs saying, oh yes, spy on your neighbors, tattle on everyone, face scanning cameras going in, passive MRIs going in, and then the denial of some of the people out there.
[00:02:27.312 --> 00:02:29.734]  But I'm gonna try to not start yelling and screaming.
[00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:35.500]  You know, you'd think I'd be happy being right in the last five years, telling you to buy gold back when it was 300 bucks an ounce, and it's now 1,040.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.823]  All-time record broken.
[00:02:38.823 --> 00:02:40.324]  I'm not happy at all right now.
[00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:44.708]  I told my wife this morning.
[00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:46.430]  I didn't have to tell her.
[00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.451]  She's smart.
[00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:48.952]  Got a woman's intuition.
[00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:49.293]  She knows.
[00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:52.856]  It's like we're going over the waterfall here.
[00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:54.497]  A big, steep waterfall.
[00:02:54.497 --> 00:02:55.818]  A 500 foot waterfall.
[00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:58.419]  And it's not a fun ride over the edge.
[00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.581]  At least we're bracing for impact.
[00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:07.064]  The general public are in their inner tubes with their thumbs up their noses and somewhere else.
[00:03:07.064 --> 00:03:14.308]  Talking about Brett Favre and how great it is the Vikings beat the Packers.
[00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.971]  Last night.
[00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:19.153]  And you know, that's interesting.
[00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:21.436]  A 40-year-old Brett Favre.
[00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:22.057]  Very interesting.
[00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:26.663]  You know, I was watching CNN this morning while I was jogging on the treadmill and I focused on it.
[00:03:26.663 --> 00:03:30.908]  I thought it was interesting and admired the tribal leader, Brett Favre.
[00:03:30.908 --> 00:03:31.850]  He's the warrior.
[00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.432]  He can defeat the simulated enemy.
[00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:35.619]  But it's all simulated.
[00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.720]  It doesn't matter to my family in the real equation.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.001]  It's a dangerous distraction.
[00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:57.314]  Just like David Letterman having sex with women on his... Now, if he was Barney Frank with an underage brothel of young boys, he'd be just fine, but we've got to obsess all day over David Letterman and people trying to extort him, or John Travolta, people trying to extort him.
[00:03:57.314 --> 00:03:58.795]  That's par for the course in America.
[00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.912]  I had people try to extort me about a year and a half ago here locally in Austin over non-issues.
[00:04:03.912 --> 00:04:08.676]  I said, go ahead, jackass.
[00:04:08.676 --> 00:04:09.637]  But the point is...
[00:04:13.412 --> 00:04:14.553]  That stuff doesn't matter.
[00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:16.194]  Let me tell you something.
[00:04:16.194 --> 00:04:18.075]  All we've got left is the dollar.
[00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:20.876]  And I know most of the listeners are smarter than I am and know that.
[00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:21.757]  But let me tell you something.
[00:04:21.757 --> 00:04:23.598]  Your dumbass neighbor doesn't know.
[00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:28.620]  And they're going to get violently angry when this happens, and the government's going to point them at the Patriot movement.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.443]  Oh yes, as things get worse, the hordes of yuppies are going to become bigger servants of government.
[00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:40.186]  They'll say, just give me my cool sunglasses and my BMW back, and I'll put my neighbors in ovens.
[00:04:41.903 --> 00:04:42.864]  We're going to get into that.
[00:04:42.864 --> 00:04:44.385]  Huge flu developments.
[00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:46.446]  Mike Rivero's monthly visit with us.
[00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:48.287]  And we got the makers of Camp FEMA joining us.
[00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:49.808]  The latest FEMA camp developments.
[00:04:49.808 --> 00:04:51.770]  How that ties into Hardin, Montana.
[00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.752]  Big developments there, I'll tell you about when we get back.
[00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:57.334]  News blitz straight ahead on the economy.
[00:04:57.334 --> 00:04:58.495]  The police state and a lot more.
[00:04:58.495 --> 00:04:58.875]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:07.916]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:14.005]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:16.669]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:23.236]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.236 --> 00:05:27.301]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:32.667]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:34.987]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:34.987 --> 00:05:36.748]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.748 --> 00:05:39.268]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.268 --> 00:05:43.989]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:47.710]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.831]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:52.731]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:54.832]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.743]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:02.743 --> 00:06:05.166]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:07.729]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.010]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.712]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:13.576]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.576 --> 00:06:17.580]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.922]  Do you listen to me?
[00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:26.867]  We have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:31.713]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.972]  How dare you?
[00:06:37.972 --> 00:06:43.056]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:45.939]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:52.184]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:55.266]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:06:55.266 --> 00:06:57.528]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:06:57.528 --> 00:06:59.990]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:07:02.153 --> 00:07:04.155]  Remain in your houses.
[00:07:04.155 --> 00:07:09.941]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:11.282]  Will they do it?
[00:07:11.282 --> 00:07:13.905]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:19.851]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:07:20.371 --> 00:07:22.553]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:26.837]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:07:26.837 --> 00:07:31.721]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:36.645]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:41.469]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:50.795]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:07:50.795 --> 00:07:53.297]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.

[00:07:56.359 --> 00:08:00.541]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:05.944]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.206]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.492 --> 00:08:13.293]  Well, the headlines all basically read the same.
[00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:15.194]  Dollar plunging.
[00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:19.816]  Gold reaches all-time high on dollar weakness.
[00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:25.039]  Open announcements by the G20 last week, and the week before last.
[00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:31.882]  Open announcements by the British government, the French government, the Russian government, the Japanese government, the Chinese government.
[00:08:31.882 --> 00:08:35.523]  Open announcements by the Arabs, but our media makes it about the Arabs.
[00:08:35.523 --> 00:08:38.485]  I've been saying this the last two years, because I've been watching their playbook.
[00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:42.395]  When they finally kill the dollar, they're going to blame it on Arabs.
[00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:48.370]  The average American will point to South America and believe that's where we've got a bomb, because that's where the Arabs live.
[00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:55.453]  Literally can't even find their own... Over 80% of Americans can't find their own state capital on a map in major studies that have been done.
[00:08:55.453 --> 00:08:56.593]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[00:08:56.593 --> 00:08:58.314]  They know all about Brett Favre.
[00:08:58.314 --> 00:09:04.896]  They know all about the extortion deal with John Gervaltin, the extortion deal with David Letterman.
[00:09:04.896 --> 00:09:07.576]  They know all about how to apply cosmetics.
[00:09:07.576 --> 00:09:08.897]  Girls know all about how to...
[00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:10.218]  We're good to go.
[00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:39.783]  But they don't know anything about this blue jewel blasting at 30-something thousand miles an hour through deep space orbiting a standard star two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
[00:09:39.783 --> 00:09:42.065]  They don't know about neurons in the brain.
[00:09:42.065 --> 00:09:46.868]  They don't know about fold space, quantum mechanics, electrical engineering.
[00:09:46.868 --> 00:09:49.089]  They don't know about tribal psychology.
[00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:53.192]  They don't understand algorithms of human development and societal evolution.
[00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:56.074]  They don't understand sociology, anthropology.
[00:09:56.674 --> 00:10:01.375]  They don't understand any of it of the incredible majesty we're in the middle of.
[00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:07.636]  And they don't care that a bunch of inbred jackass New World Order people that do care about that are in control.
[00:10:07.636 --> 00:10:10.317]  The con artists know how to work people.
[00:10:10.317 --> 00:10:12.297]  They know they get power out of it.
[00:10:12.297 --> 00:10:14.458]  But good people don't!
[00:10:14.458 --> 00:10:16.898]  Good people don't seem to care!
[00:10:16.898 --> 00:10:21.119]  And so we get overrun over and over again by control freaks.
[00:10:22.392 --> 00:10:32.280]  And scum, and people that only like petty power over the flesh in human realms, not in the larger realm of reaching towards the stars.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:41.567]  The destiny of this society, the destiny of this species, the New World Order is at complete loggerheads with the true destiny of humanity.
[00:10:41.567 --> 00:10:49.273]  To colonize space, to believe in the human spirit, to try to empower and enlighten and bring forward, that's what I burn with desire!
[00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:55.599]  That is my absolute wish is to abolish all forms of tyranny over the minds of man.
[00:10:55.599 --> 00:10:58.561]  I am totally in league with Thomas Jefferson.
[00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:01.964]  And I don't know how any of you wouldn't want to be in league with this.
[00:11:01.964 --> 00:11:08.689]  I feel sorry for the cops beating up students and lying about them and framing people and violating the First Amendment.
[00:11:08.689 --> 00:11:15.015]  I feel sorry for the military when they carry out these tyrannical operations to control opium in Afghanistan and oil in Iraq.
[00:11:16.147 --> 00:11:21.671]  I feel sorry for you because you're missing out on truly being on the side of the good guys.
[00:11:21.671 --> 00:11:24.854]  You think you're the good guys, but look at yourselves in the mirror.
[00:11:24.854 --> 00:11:26.055]  Look at your uniforms.
[00:11:26.055 --> 00:11:27.556]  Look at your nomenclature.
[00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:29.137]  Look at your attitudes.
[00:11:29.137 --> 00:11:35.082]  You are not on the side of good unless you get your head right and get into the spirit of 1776.
[00:11:35.082 --> 00:11:39.005]  Now, I said I'm going to do a news blitz.
[00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:43.769]  It's just I've been announcing to my crew in the office
[00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:55.364]  I've been calling the Watsons in England, I've been calling Kurt Nemo in New Mexico, I've been calling my family, and I've been telling them the last month, I've told them, officially, we are now inside the New World Order.
[00:11:55.364 --> 00:12:00.128]  And I want to just tell the audience that, and I want to do a whole show on this later in the week or next week.
[00:12:00.128 --> 00:12:11.658]  I may even take some time off this week just to meditate on this and really try to collect my thoughts, because when I'm not on air, I totally understand what's happening, I can articulate it, my thought patterns are much more crystallized, and I get on air and it's just...
[00:12:13.123 --> 00:12:16.184]  It's just frustrating, and I just get angry.
[00:12:16.184 --> 00:12:28.649]  But when I quietly am thinking about this, or when I'm jogging, or when I'm going to bed at 10 o'clock at night, I'm trying to go to bed earlier, it's just so clear what we're facing, how to deal with it, how to counter it.
[00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:30.449]  I understand the mind of the enemy.
[00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:31.850]  I understand all their moves.
[00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:32.910]  I know what they're going to do.
[00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.491]  I know how to beat these people.
[00:12:35.598 --> 00:12:40.761]  But they have weakened us, they have turned us against each other, they have made us decadent evil slobs.
[00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:45.704]  The New World Order makes evil look cool and fun so you can be weakened!
[00:12:45.704 --> 00:12:53.649]  Your spiritual immune system has to be brought down so they can take you over, so you will be blind, so you can be fed on.
[00:12:53.649 --> 00:13:04.036]  You know, I've read reports of some prized snakes where they will amputate the legs and poke out the eyes of the guinea pigs or other animals, piglets, things they feed to them.
[00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:07.236]  So they don't scratch and hurt the snake.
[00:13:07.236 --> 00:13:10.098]  And that's what America and the world is, but we're the model.
[00:13:10.098 --> 00:13:10.699]  So is England.
[00:13:10.699 --> 00:13:12.199]  We're the two models of this.
[00:13:12.199 --> 00:13:14.761]  We've had our eyes poked out.
[00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:16.162]  We're mindless gibbering.
[00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:22.140]  Guinea pigs being dropped into a pit with a big old snake that eats us.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.141]  And I'm tired of watching my fellow people fed on.
[00:13:25.141 --> 00:13:29.562]  I don't care if you're Hispanic, black, white, German, Jewish, Chinese.
[00:13:29.562 --> 00:13:30.562]  They want to divide us.
[00:13:30.562 --> 00:13:32.023]  They want to make it all about race.
[00:13:32.023 --> 00:13:33.863]  They want to divide us along religion.
[00:13:33.863 --> 00:13:36.264]  They use all of this to control us.
[00:13:38.257 --> 00:13:47.959]  And there are legitimate differences of opinion with groups, and there are tribal groups, and there are groups, and there are mafias, and people are fighting with each other, and that is how humans arrange themselves.
[00:13:47.959 --> 00:14:05.002]  But I'm telling you, if we don't have a big revelation, an awakening, an understanding of this... How did the old-timers know, 50 years ago, when they set up the Department of Education, to start taking over education, that it was, quote, Nazi or Soviet, that they wanted to break up the family?
[00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:12.425]  Because we had veterans who'd been in Russia and been in Germany and been in places and seen what had been done there.
[00:14:12.425 --> 00:14:19.614]  But now in 2009 we have hundreds of government textbooks and we list their names every day here and publish them and post them and scan them.
[00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:24.680]  Where the government states it wants to break up the family and take over your life.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:37.115]  I mean, it's not like we just sit here and go, gee, when local police tell you to spy on your neighbors, and when they say you can't babysit your neighbor's kids without a license, when they say homeschooling's illegal, and when they say you've got to take forced inoculations,
[00:14:38.914 --> 00:14:43.356]  And when they are building prison camps everywhere, man, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:14:43.356 --> 00:14:47.478]  This is the government, social engineering, a scientific dictatorship.
[00:14:47.478 --> 00:14:48.719]  That's not our opinion.
[00:14:48.719 --> 00:14:52.861]  The establishment calls it a scientific dictatorship.
[00:14:52.861 --> 00:14:55.462]  I mean, they're telling us what they're doing.
[00:14:55.462 --> 00:15:01.105]  This is an old-timers 50 years ago before they had textbooks on it, recognizing what it was and warning us.
[00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:02.406]  Thank God!
[00:15:02.406 --> 00:15:05.689]  They were the early warning system, and they got made fun of and laughed at.
[00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:11.454]  This isn't people 50 years- THIS IS ADMITTED, PEOPLE!
[00:15:11.454 --> 00:15:13.456]  It's admitted they're poisoning our water supply.
[00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:16.158]  It's admitted they're chemtrailing us.
[00:15:16.158 --> 00:15:17.879]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:20.622]  I'm gonna try to calmly go over the demise of the dollar.
[00:15:20.622 --> 00:15:22.363]  That's openly being trumpeted right now.
[00:15:22.363 --> 00:15:25.266]  The trumpeting of the killing of the dollar is how they kill it.
[00:15:27.162 --> 00:15:30.163]  Then I got a stack of flu news off the charts.
[00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:32.224]  I got big Hardin, Montana developments.
[00:15:32.224 --> 00:15:32.664]  Big!
[00:15:32.664 --> 00:15:35.065]  The biggest yet.
[00:15:35.065 --> 00:15:38.646]  And I've got a bunch of other police, state, and Second Amendment news all over the country.
[00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:42.067]  They're attacking the Second Amendment at the state level.
[00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:42.967]  And I've got the L.A.
[00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:45.048]  Times, legislation,
[00:15:46.027 --> 00:15:49.428]  Requiring ID and thumbprint to purchase handgun ammo.
[00:15:49.428 --> 00:15:51.029]  And then it's going to be all ammo.
[00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:53.750]  Thumbprinting biometrically, I always told you that was the plan.
[00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.811]  And then it's going to be for the national ID card, for your carbon footprint, you're going to thumbprint.
[00:15:57.811 --> 00:15:59.632]  That's official government!
[00:15:59.632 --> 00:16:03.193]  Department of Labor, Department of Commerce have openly stated it.
[00:16:03.193 --> 00:16:05.254]  They're starting by law to ban trans fat.
[00:16:05.254 --> 00:16:05.934]  Sounds reasonable.
[00:16:05.934 --> 00:16:08.175]  They're going to tax anything they say is unhealthy.
[00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:09.356]  They're going to track everything.
[00:16:09.356 --> 00:16:11.557]  Folks, listen to me.
[00:16:11.557 --> 00:16:12.397]  This is hell on earth.
[00:16:13.527 --> 00:16:19.470]  They're announcing passive MRIs, body scanning you on the streets going in, not just in over a hundred airports.
[00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.411]  Naked body scanners are going in nationwide.
[00:16:23.411 --> 00:16:26.533]  Ladies and gentlemen, they mean business.
[00:16:26.533 --> 00:16:31.675]  And let me tell you something.
[00:16:31.675 --> 00:16:33.476]  Let's cover the financial news first.
[00:16:33.476 --> 00:16:36.137]  Dollar demise inexorable, but not sudden.
[00:16:38.015 --> 00:16:39.436]  That's one headline.
[00:16:39.436 --> 00:16:44.840]  Here is the London Telegraph today.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.743]  The demise of the dollar.
[00:16:47.743 --> 00:16:55.709]  In a graphic illustration of the New World Order, that's the first headline, Arab states have launched secret moves with China, Russia, and France to stop using U.S.
[00:16:55.709 --> 00:16:57.110]  currency for oil trading.
[00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:02.594]  That was always the plan with the euro, to switch to it for a while and then do SDRs, global currency.
[00:17:02.594 --> 00:17:03.155]  Oil states
[00:17:04.378 --> 00:17:05.199]  Are replacing it.
[00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:09.242]  Gold surges to record high above $1,040 right now.
[00:17:09.242 --> 00:17:12.644]  I'm going to break all this down.
[00:17:12.644 --> 00:17:14.706]  But first, I wanted to go to Ted Anderson.
[00:17:14.706 --> 00:17:19.009]  Ted Anderson, I talked to you this morning when gold was at $125.
[00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:19.830]  It's now at $140.
[00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.712]  You're going to hold it until 2 o'clock today.
[00:17:22.712 --> 00:17:24.273]  You can't do it until midnight right now.
[00:17:25.202 --> 00:17:27.606]  The end of the show you'll announce whether you can or not.
[00:17:27.606 --> 00:17:35.156]  You have francs, you have sovereigns at the $9.91, $9.94 level when you bought those two groups of coins.
[00:17:35.156 --> 00:17:40.684]  With it now at above $1,040, you're running out of the silver at the $8-something level.
[00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:41.566]  Tell folks about that.
[00:17:41.889 --> 00:17:42.469]  Well, I don't know.
[00:17:42.469 --> 00:17:49.413]  For everybody who listened to the show yesterday, you can go back and take a look at Infowars.com and see that I haven't raised the prices yet.
[00:17:49.413 --> 00:17:56.437]  Currently, right now, we do have the Franks and we have the British Sovereigns at the same exact price as they were yesterday.
[00:17:56.437 --> 00:18:01.920]  And the reason why they're there is because I bought them when the prices were down in that 988 level up to about 924.
[00:18:07.263 --> 00:18:09.585]  The British Sovereign right now is at $2.88.
[00:18:09.585 --> 00:18:11.806]  The Frank is at $2.33.
[00:18:11.806 --> 00:18:21.793]  Alex, I don't know why it makes a difference, but for some reason here in October, when all these countries are talking about getting away from the United States dollar and getting into a basket of currencies,
[00:18:22.233 --> 00:18:25.134]  It's making a big difference to this market, but it is.
[00:18:25.134 --> 00:18:28.436]  I mean, we saw gold drop down today, correct?
[00:18:28.436 --> 00:18:28.816]  Down to $1,025.
[00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:29.757]  And now it's shot back up to $1,041.
[00:18:29.757 --> 00:18:31.157]  And today's peak today is $1,044.
[00:18:31.157 --> 00:18:32.198]  Now the previous record was $1,031.
[00:18:42.183 --> 00:18:43.785]  $1,030.80.
[00:18:43.785 --> 00:18:48.549]  So for those of you who don't know, right now gold is at a market peak that it's never seen before.
[00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:55.815]  What that also means is that the support level for gold has now moved up, and when you see it correct, we'll be lucky to see the $900 an ounce.
[00:18:57.076 --> 00:19:06.762]  Then it'll go up to $1,100, and then it'll correct to $1,000, then $1,200, then correct to $1,050, then go up to $1,400, correct down to $1,200.
[00:19:06.762 --> 00:19:09.864]  That's what all the market experts are saying.
[00:19:09.864 --> 00:19:11.845]  All I know is, it's not fiat.
[00:19:11.845 --> 00:19:13.586]  They can't completely devalue it.
[00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:14.527]  It's the safest bet.
[00:19:14.527 --> 00:19:18.369]  It's the best investment since 2001, more than tripling, Ted!
[00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:19.090]  It sure is.
[00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:25.334]  It has been just solid and safe for over 6,000 years, and it's not surprising to me to see it do incredibly well.
[00:19:25.674 --> 00:19:33.537]  Well Ted, I want to hold you over for one more segment to talk about what we're seeing with the foreigners and what a dollar implosion or devaluation will mean, what it'll look like.
[00:19:33.537 --> 00:19:36.079]  But listen, he can hold it till the end of the show today, 800-686-2237.
[00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:38.680]  He can hold gold that he bought at the 991 to 995 level.
[00:19:44.122 --> 00:19:44.923]  Until 2 today.
[00:19:44.923 --> 00:19:47.025]  You cannot find this deal anywhere.
[00:19:47.025 --> 00:19:48.806]  Most people can't even get gold right now.
[00:19:48.806 --> 00:19:50.328]  It's selling out.
[00:19:50.328 --> 00:19:52.450]  800-686-2237.
[00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.051]  Take advantage of this deal.
[00:19:54.051 --> 00:19:54.932]  Don't be a fool.
[00:19:54.932 --> 00:19:55.553]  800-686-2237.
[00:19:55.553 --> 00:20:00.637]  Ted Anderson, stay with us.
[00:20:00.637 --> 00:20:03.600]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:07.897]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:07.897 --> 00:20:11.619]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:20:11.619 --> 00:20:18.541]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[00:20:21.786 --> 00:20:22.026]  I think so.
[00:20:50.362 --> 00:20:55.525]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com, or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:20:55.525 --> 00:21:01.029]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:02.050]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:07.573]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:21:07.573 --> 00:21:08.114]  I get it.
[00:21:08.114 --> 00:21:17.740]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.901]  That's not what's happening.
[00:21:19.141 --> 00:21:27.608]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:21:27.608 --> 00:21:31.011]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:21:31.011 --> 00:21:35.274]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:21:35.274 --> 00:21:36.876]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:21:36.876 --> 00:21:40.839]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:44.442]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:21:44.642 --> 00:21:45.544]  You should, too.
[00:21:45.544 --> 00:21:46.685]  Find out what they know.
[00:21:46.685 --> 00:21:50.071]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:21:50.071 --> 00:21:50.331]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.331 --> 00:21:50.411]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:50.592]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.495 --> 00:22:02.478]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:22:02.478 --> 00:22:06.103]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:22:06.103 --> 00:22:08.566]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:22:08.566 --> 00:22:11.630]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:15.435]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:15.755]  We're good.
[00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:37.237]  Directly to your computer or iPhone and share it with others.
[00:22:37.237 --> 00:22:43.261]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:48.124]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[00:22:48.124 --> 00:22:50.986]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[00:22:50.986 --> 00:22:53.048]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:57.190]  Put them on the file sharing networks.

[00:22:59.012 --> 00:22:59.752]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:01.053 --> 00:23:02.633]  Are you constantly tired?
[00:23:02.633 --> 00:23:04.474]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[00:23:04.474 --> 00:23:07.755]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[00:23:07.755 --> 00:23:10.795]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[00:24:03.464 --> 00:24:06.249]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.741 --> 00:24:23.129]  We're going to go live for the last three hours of the show today, simulcasting the radio, it's already live, at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:24:23.129 --> 00:24:36.542]  We're going to be premiering next hour with Mike Rivero's on with us, the big official, we already had a sneak peek trailer, but the big official trailer for Fall of Republic.
[00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:38.064]  We'll be simulcasting that at
[00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:46.782]  PrisonPlanet.tv here on the radio and it's going to be going live the next hour at FollowTheRepublic.com.
[00:24:46.782 --> 00:24:54.627]  That's FollowTheRepublic.com, a premiere there at PrisonPlanet.tv and FollowTheRepublic.com so you get an idea of the type of quality.
[00:24:55.727 --> 00:25:03.970]  This is just the medium quality that members will be seeing at PrisonPlanet.tv with the October 21st premiere online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:20.176]  And Mike Rivera is coming up, then we got William Lewis and Gary Franchi getting their take on the Hardin, Montana situation, the militarization of police, how this ties in with their film Camp FEMA, this archipelago of private prisons, government prisons, and designated sites, black sites, ghost sites.
[00:25:21.184 --> 00:25:25.587]  So, that is coming up today as well, and open phones.
[00:25:25.587 --> 00:25:29.189]  I've got a lot of very serious Second Amendment news as well, but going back to Ted Anderson.
[00:25:29.189 --> 00:25:39.896]  Ted, the constant drumbeat at G20, and Geithner admitting, yeah, we're looking at phasing out the dollar as the world reserve currency, going directly to SDRs.
[00:25:39.896 --> 00:25:46.020]  People keep saying, well, will I see a new red money, or blue money, or will we see some new New World Order money?
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:46.060]  No.
[00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:54.773]  A private bank of the world that funds itself through carbon taxes and money transfer, Tobin taxes, and wellhead taxes.
[00:25:54.773 --> 00:25:56.175]  This has openly been announced.
[00:25:56.175 --> 00:25:59.098]  Every day it's in the financial publications for years.
[00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.752]  That is going to fund the private shareholders of the private U.S.
[00:26:03.752 --> 00:26:07.195]  Federal Reserve that owns the Private Bank of England and the private banks in Europe.
[00:26:07.195 --> 00:26:08.796]  It's the same group on record.
[00:26:08.796 --> 00:26:11.097]  We will now pay taxes directly to them.
[00:26:11.097 --> 00:26:17.462]  They will set the global currency rates and insider trade on that to wreck economies and consolidate them.
[00:26:17.462 --> 00:26:19.603]  This is all a consolidation mafia move.
[00:26:19.603 --> 00:26:20.604]  It's all loan sharking.
[00:26:20.604 --> 00:26:22.725]  30% interest rates.
[00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:26.087]  Soon as they get you in debt, they double the interest rates from 15% to 30% loan sharking.
[00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:29.236]  And this is about a vertical integration.
[00:26:29.236 --> 00:26:41.539]  That's why they're calling it an economy that's in a boom now, that's out of the recession, but oh, in the new recession we have 10% unemployment, and that's their Cook numbers, it's more like 20.
[00:26:41.539 --> 00:26:42.480]  But the banks do well.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:47.161]  I mean, I was watching CNBC this morning as they were explaining this is the new economy.
[00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:52.383]  And so you have a bank of the world that bankrupts the planet by design, you pay all your taxes to them,
[00:26:53.163 --> 00:27:06.256]  They control the world different currencies at the region level and then they have SDRs bank to bank that are just fiat and they create unlimited amounts of money and bypass governments even issuing T-bills.
[00:27:07.765 --> 00:27:11.246]  I mean, Ted Anderson, this is so diabolical.
[00:27:11.246 --> 00:27:15.767]  This is like a con artist like Michael Hilton taking over the town of Hardin.
[00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:20.889]  Instead, it's con artist banking families just take over the world and say, we control the money.
[00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:24.810]  Everybody bows down and the stormtroopers march out billy clubbing the public.
[00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:30.874]  Well, Alex, what I have to say right now is I wish I could prove you wrong, but you're absolutely right on.
[00:27:30.874 --> 00:27:33.395]  That's the whole sadness over this whole thing.
[00:27:33.395 --> 00:27:40.780]  The only glimmer of hope and light to this is that the people are getting smart and they're waking up to it.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:46.724]  Unfortunately, they're still in the minority, and we need more people to be able to stand up against this tyranny.
[00:27:46.724 --> 00:27:51.167]  But, you know, Alex, I just have to say, if you're sitting there with money that's
[00:27:51.767 --> 00:28:00.030]  You know, I mean, in the stock market, in the bond market, in the annuities, I mean, you name it, if it's dollar-denominated value, you're going to lose purchasing power.
[00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:06.312]  The market itself is going to make you want to trade this foreign currency because of the currency that you have here.
[00:28:06.312 --> 00:28:07.253]  Well, I agree with you, Ted.
[00:28:07.253 --> 00:28:08.173]  It's not trustworthy.
[00:28:08.513 --> 00:28:13.056]  And I agree with you, and Bob Chapman's been right about every major announcement he's said.
[00:28:13.056 --> 00:28:28.588]  Over a year ago, he said in the summer they'd run the market back up, and then sometime in the fall or winter plunge it even further this time, then they'll jack it back up again, and it's meant to sucker in the non-institutional investors and cull off the middle class's money.
[00:28:28.588 --> 00:28:34.933]  And I just watch these yuppies just waiting to be raped even harder, and they just will not buy silver and gold.
[00:28:34.933 --> 00:28:36.514]  They do not want profits.
[00:28:37.196 --> 00:28:43.980]  Well, you know, I think it's just a matter of being brainwashed into the fact that the status quo is the way to do things.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.221]  There is a group of people now that are buying gold.
[00:28:46.221 --> 00:28:53.085]  I was real surprised today to see that a lot of people wanted to buy and take advantage of yesterday's prices.
[00:28:53.085 --> 00:28:59.308]  I have to say that, you know, it's simply you're not going to be able to buy gold at the prices that I am posted at right now.
[00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:00.188]  We're good to go.
[00:29:19.338 --> 00:29:20.698]  Forty-one right now.
[00:29:20.698 --> 00:29:21.639]  All-time record.
[00:29:21.639 --> 00:29:24.600]  Ten dollars above any previous record.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, 800-686-2237.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.062]  800-686-2237.
[00:29:31.062 --> 00:29:31.902]  Take advantage.
[00:29:31.902 --> 00:29:34.923]  Ted can hold it till two o'clock today at the very end of the show.
[00:29:34.923 --> 00:29:35.844]  He'll give us an update.
[00:29:36.544 --> 00:29:36.904]  800-686-2237.
[00:29:36.904 --> 00:29:42.747]  But you've got to tell them you heard it on this radio show or it's going to be the higher price.
[00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:43.848]  It's still a great deal.
[00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:45.188]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[00:29:45.188 --> 00:29:46.509]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:48.310]  They got the half dollars in silver.
[00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.991]  They got the gold francs in the sovereigns.
[00:29:50.991 --> 00:29:52.392]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.392 --> 00:29:54.933]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.933 --> 00:29:57.595]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:03.885]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:09.210]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.272]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.272 --> 00:30:16.277]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.277 --> 00:30:17.198]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.438 --> 00:30:18.559]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.460]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.521]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:23.722]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.722 --> 00:30:25.063]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.063 --> 00:30:26.604]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.604 --> 00:30:31.867]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.867 --> 00:30:35.450]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.912]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.252 --> 00:30:40.493]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.493 --> 00:30:41.394]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.394 --> 00:30:42.494]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.494 --> 00:30:43.415]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.415 --> 00:30:44.516]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.516 --> 00:30:47.578]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.578 --> 00:30:49.339]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.339 --> 00:30:50.260]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.337 --> 00:31:07.360]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:13.242]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.242 --> 00:31:19.405]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:21.706]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.706 --> 00:31:24.167]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.167 --> 00:31:37.353]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:39.034]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:40.895]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.895 --> 00:31:47.118]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.788 --> 00:31:56.053]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.053 --> 00:31:57.634]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.634 --> 00:31:58.835]  The people strike back!
[00:32:01.218 --> 00:32:08.743]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:32:08.743 --> 00:32:13.246]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:32:13.246 --> 00:32:18.390]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:25.094]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your healthy
[00:32:25.134 --> 00:32:25.374]  I think so.
[00:32:43.496 --> 00:32:48.999]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision dot com.
[00:32:48.999 --> 00:32:51.521]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[00:32:51.521 --> 00:32:52.161]  Or, call 269-409-1776.
[00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:52.461]  269-409-1776 today!
[00:33:13.425 --> 00:33:20.789]  I want to go over in detail what's happening in the economy and the preparation to decapitate the dollar.
[00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:23.291]  To make way for world government.
[00:33:23.291 --> 00:33:26.252]  And what that's going to mean when we lose the dollar.
[00:33:26.252 --> 00:33:29.634]  A lot of these arrogant yuppies have no idea what that even means.
[00:33:29.634 --> 00:33:33.077]  They're going to find out real fast.
[00:33:33.077 --> 00:33:35.038]  We also have all this police state news.
[00:33:35.038 --> 00:33:35.958]  Hardin, Montana.
[00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:36.939]  Big developments there.
[00:33:36.939 --> 00:33:37.599]  The biggest yet.
[00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:54.076]  Barack Obama is continuing every Bush policy just with a little bit different rhetoric, but right now he's giving a speech announcing that the fusion centers, when you hear the term fusion center, that means total federalization of your local county and city, total dictatorship.
[00:33:54.076 --> 00:34:07.498]  When you hear fusion center, that means the feds coming in and saying no protests, no demonstration, no gathering, more than one person in any place, we're going to break a billy club over your head when you come out of a store, we're going to have police dogs attack all women.
[00:34:08.598 --> 00:34:14.922]  That means the regular Army and National Guard running your local police department in the computer systems the feds put in.
[00:34:14.922 --> 00:34:23.326]  And he's announcing that, he's announcing Al Qaeda is about to hit us, and he's doing the best he can to keep us safe, which means they're getting ready to stage some terror attacks.
[00:34:23.326 --> 00:34:31.371]  His approval rating has now dropped down to 40 points, lowest of any president, 11 months into his first administration.
[00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:33.192]  Ten and a half months into his first administration.
[00:34:34.284 --> 00:34:37.666]  And let's go ahead and fade up the dictator-in-chief.
[00:34:37.666 --> 00:34:38.306]  Oh, he's gone.
[00:34:38.306 --> 00:34:39.207]  He's done with his speech.
[00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:42.769]  Well, I've got all the articles here and we'll play some chilling clips of it.
[00:34:42.769 --> 00:34:46.231]  Fusion Framework and Fusion Core Solution.
[00:34:46.231 --> 00:34:48.272]  Microsoft paid for all of this.
[00:34:48.272 --> 00:34:57.477]  The face scanning cameras, the license plate reading cameras, the federal software built into all the phones by federal law to track where your cell phone goes down to just three feet.
[00:34:58.382 --> 00:35:07.346]  The body scanners, the systems tracking you, the fake databases, putting your name on databases as a terrorist if you have bad credit.
[00:35:07.346 --> 00:35:14.569]  This is their sickening control grid, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:16.810]  And Obama is running around giving his speech.
[00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:27.219]  On that front, we are going to have the world premiere of the big trailer for Fall of the Republic.
[00:35:27.219 --> 00:35:34.882]  And this is the Fall of the Republic, the birth of world government, the birth of the New World Order, and the rise of the resistance.
[00:35:34.882 --> 00:35:36.322]  Yes, it's the Fall of the Republic.
[00:35:36.322 --> 00:35:39.363]  Let's just admit the Republic's been taken over by offshore banks.
[00:35:39.363 --> 00:35:41.344]  They've abolished the Bill of Rights.
[00:35:41.344 --> 00:35:44.085]  They're operating 110% to set the precedent.
[00:35:44.085 --> 00:35:45.466]  There is no Bill of Rights.
[00:35:45.466 --> 00:35:46.586]  There is no Constitution.
[00:35:51.368 --> 00:35:54.791]  They are doing it!
[00:35:54.791 --> 00:35:58.434]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen, they are taking over our society right now.
[00:35:58.434 --> 00:36:02.577]  This is really happening.
[00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:08.302]  And notice they've got the other federalization smokescreen.
[00:36:08.302 --> 00:36:18.411]  And notice Obama is the first president to run the United Nations Security Council, which they even admitted on CNN has all the power in the UN, the General Assembly.
[00:36:18.411 --> 00:36:19.312]  When they introduced him,
[00:36:20.313 --> 00:36:28.462]  As the chairman of the Security Council, the 15-member board, CNN's Wolf Blitzer said, the only position with any power in the U.N.
[00:36:28.462 --> 00:36:29.003]  The U.N.'
[00:36:28.983 --> 00:36:30.545]  's a dictatorship.
[00:36:30.545 --> 00:36:32.947]  It's designed to look like it's all free and happy.
[00:36:32.947 --> 00:36:35.751]  You look at the 31 articles of the U.N.
[00:36:35.751 --> 00:36:40.356]  Declaration of Human Rights, the first 28
[00:36:41.977 --> 00:36:45.499]  Give you all these wonderful great rights, but it says the government gives them to you.
[00:36:45.499 --> 00:36:52.161]  You don't innately have them as a free sentient being in the galaxy, in the universe.
[00:36:52.161 --> 00:36:52.942]  No.
[00:36:52.942 --> 00:37:01.105]  You get it from the UN, and then Article 30 and 31, they say, we can revoke these at any time if the UN wants to in their privileges.
[00:37:01.105 --> 00:37:03.686]  And we can arrest you and shut down your free speech.
[00:37:03.686 --> 00:37:04.547]  Notice this week,
[00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:09.793]  Actually, last Friday, they announced that the Internet that the U.S.
[00:37:09.793 --> 00:37:15.719]  designed and built and that the ICANN naming and numbering system was handed over
[00:37:16.843 --> 00:37:19.585]  To a private corporation completely that's under U.N.
[00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:20.885]  control.
[00:37:20.885 --> 00:37:22.766]  Everything's being transferred.
[00:37:22.766 --> 00:37:24.287]  The President's now the U.N.
[00:37:24.287 --> 00:37:24.867]  head.
[00:37:24.867 --> 00:37:26.588]  He swears allegiance to it.
[00:37:26.588 --> 00:37:28.930]  The Internet's handed over to the U.N.
[00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:35.293]  They announce that they're going to be shutting down the dollar in the next two years, incrementally, so we don't riot.
[00:37:35.293 --> 00:37:38.935]  Because if they dropped you flat on your face, you'd get really angry.
[00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:45.141]  If suddenly two-thirds of your buying power on top of the depression hits you, you'd freak out.
[00:37:45.141 --> 00:37:46.102]  No, no, no.
[00:37:46.102 --> 00:37:47.523]  This is going to be done slowly.
[00:37:47.523 --> 00:37:53.525]  They're going to lovingly push you under the water and just patch your hair as you suck water into your lungs.
[00:37:53.525 --> 00:37:53.645]  Oh!
[00:37:53.645 --> 00:37:57.147]  And they'll have smiling faces reading off teleprompters.
[00:37:57.147 --> 00:38:01.769]  Infobabes smiling lovingly at you in a motherly way.
[00:38:01.769 --> 00:38:04.651]  Smacking their lips with glistening lipstick.
[00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:05.871]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:38:05.871 --> 00:38:06.972]  We're your friends.
[00:38:08.015 --> 00:38:15.865]  And all the yuppies and morons will smile back.
[00:38:15.865 --> 00:38:17.267]  This is the New World Order.
[00:38:17.267 --> 00:38:18.509]  It's happening right now.
[00:38:18.509 --> 00:38:21.312]  Now, Mike Rivera's coming up.
[00:38:21.312 --> 00:38:23.535]  We're going to go into the flu.
[00:38:23.535 --> 00:38:24.877]  On the flu front,
[00:38:26.485 --> 00:38:28.768]  Again, it's like I'm watching the Twilight Zone or something.
[00:38:28.768 --> 00:38:30.170]  I'm in the Twilight Zone.
[00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:40.222]  I watch CNN, I watch Fox, and Shepard Smith says it's a conspiracy theory, there are no adverse reactions, no side effects, none of the flu shots, seasonal, or H1N1 can hurt you.
[00:38:40.222 --> 00:38:41.204]  It is a lie!
[00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:45.692]  Then he cuts, because it's double think, it's psych warfare.
[00:38:45.692 --> 00:38:47.952]  Everything's fine, then they still warn you.
[00:38:47.952 --> 00:38:51.033]  They cut to a doctor on the same show, and I saw it yesterday morning.
[00:38:51.033 --> 00:38:54.574]  We taped this on Shepard Smith at like 4 or 5, whenever it's on during the day.
[00:38:54.574 --> 00:38:56.255]  Later, it was the same thing.
[00:38:56.255 --> 00:39:03.557]  They go, oh yes, it can cause Guillain, or Guillain-Barré, or however you pronounce it, neurological disorders.
[00:39:03.557 --> 00:39:03.997]  It can
[00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:08.438]  Cause horrible autoimmune responses.
[00:39:08.438 --> 00:39:09.998]  It can kill you.
[00:39:09.998 --> 00:39:11.438]  It's got mercury in it.
[00:39:11.438 --> 00:39:12.679]  It's got live virus.
[00:39:12.679 --> 00:39:19.740]  And the first 10 million dosages are live virus nasal spray for those two years old and up.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:28.202]  And then I've got the official printouts on the seasonal and the new vaccine.
[00:39:28.202 --> 00:39:29.703]  The seasonal has the H1N1.
[00:39:29.703 --> 00:39:33.504]  They did a double take, double cross on us.
[00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:34.144]  They admit
[00:39:35.049 --> 00:39:44.937]  That it's got the mercury and the adjuvants in it, they admit it's live, and that it breathes the virus in the nasal passage and that it's going to spread it everywhere?
[00:39:44.937 --> 00:39:49.882]  I mean, I have mainstream news and the Mayo Clinic admitting all this!
[00:39:52.734 --> 00:39:58.301]  And they admitted on Fox, they go, none of this is true, it doesn't exist, it's totally fine.
[00:39:58.301 --> 00:40:06.812]  Kind of like drug ads go, it's wonderful, it makes you happy, it'll make you skip through fields of daisies, and everything will be wonderful, but it can also cause heart attack, brain damage, death, cancer, blah blah blah.
[00:40:06.812 --> 00:40:09.276]  You know, in the last 10 seconds of the ad, like it's a...
[00:40:10.678 --> 00:40:13.340]  Auctioneer rapid-fire reading what it makes you do.
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.141]  Do you have restless leg syndrome?
[00:40:15.141 --> 00:40:21.206]  Well, it can make you, you know, have a blood clot or make you go crazy or make you become a sex maniac or a gambling addict.
[00:40:21.206 --> 00:40:25.869]  But it doesn't... I mean, they actually say that for that drug.
[00:40:25.869 --> 00:40:36.577]  And it's just a public who's got learned helplessness just bathed, absolutely bathed, in total
[00:40:38.075 --> 00:40:45.476]  And complete 110% tyranny.
[00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:52.378]  I'm going to open the phones up right now for people that want to talk about any of this craziness.
[00:40:52.378 --> 00:40:59.399]  The open killing of the dollar, the butchering of it, the gang stabbing of the Julius Caesar of currencies.
[00:40:59.399 --> 00:41:05.220]  I mean, they're in the Senate right now, all taking part, stabbing it, blood splattering.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.661]  The yuppies are walking around talking about Brett Favre and
[00:41:09.158 --> 00:41:20.727]  David Letterman, and okay, great, talk about it, enjoy it, but when you're homeless, lined up at the FEMA Center, I mean, have you noticed this whole police state is happening right now?
[00:41:22.356 --> 00:41:40.981]  As they implode the dollar, as they bring in the tyranny, Obama's on TV announcing, don't worry, the feds are taking over, don't worry, Al-Qaeda's about to hit, we'll keep you safe, give up all your rights, and then you read the actual DHS reports, and they say the whole thing's set up for gun owners, veterans, and people that don't like the Federal Reserve, because it's coming out that that's who rules us!
[00:41:40.981 --> 00:41:42.021]  That's the government!
[00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:45.562]  The offshore bankers that engineered all this!
[00:41:45.562 --> 00:41:51.024]  And instead of us just waking up, and saying no, and having grand juries indict this group of made-offs,
[00:41:52.099 --> 00:41:55.981]  And Ken Lay, Enron types, it's literally who runs it all.
[00:41:55.981 --> 00:41:58.101]  Bunch of criminals bigger than them.
[00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:02.383]  Instead of them going to jail and us fixing our economy and all this stopping, no!
[00:42:02.383 --> 00:42:07.985]  It's just like Hardin, Montana, where it's a convicted 14-time felon scam artist lying about everything.
[00:42:07.985 --> 00:42:13.708]  They still say, well, we're going to try to redo the contract with him because we can't say we're wrong if that's all this is!
[00:42:14.728 --> 00:42:25.121]  And so there's gonna be death camps and FEMA camps and tattletale squads in total control because people cannot and will not wake up and they will not admit they've been conned.
[00:42:27.259 --> 00:42:41.450]  And so the bankers are going to openly run up their flag in the country, have us pay taxes to them, they're going to arrest people, political dissidents are going to disappear, the cops love it, the cops everywhere openly announce no free speech, no protest allowed in D.C.
[00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:52.198]  at the G20, they don't even issue permits, they turn a right into a privilege, they're going to go after our guns, they're going to shut down farms and ranches and homeschooling and it's all happening.
[00:42:53.311 --> 00:42:56.534]  And the kids are going to be wearing armbands and marching in the streets.
[00:42:56.534 --> 00:42:57.795]  It's already happening.
[00:42:57.795 --> 00:43:00.378]  They're doing military drills.
[00:43:00.378 --> 00:43:03.901]  I've seen the City Year people in their uniforms in Austin.
[00:43:03.901 --> 00:43:07.825]  I mean, Girl Scouts being trained to spy on everybody, Boy Scouts.
[00:43:07.825 --> 00:43:10.027]  I mean, this is hell!
[00:43:10.027 --> 00:43:11.768]  This is hell!
[00:43:11.768 --> 00:43:16.052]  I mean, it's really what happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany is going to happen here.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:21.603]  Just like it happens everywhere else, and it's gonna happen bigger and better in America.
[00:43:21.603 --> 00:43:37.453]  And they got a bunch of control freaks who think they're God, who wear a badge and have a gun, and a bunch of sicko prosecutors that have built giant prisons all over their towns, and they move up the chain if they build more prisons and fill them, and they're gonna fill them!
[00:43:37.453 --> 00:43:43.257]  I've got one here out of the London Telegraph, where it says, to police,
[00:43:44.938 --> 00:43:46.759]  This is BBC.
[00:43:46.759 --> 00:43:49.321]  Review a babysitting ban ordered.
[00:43:49.321 --> 00:43:55.385]  It says even two groups of police officers aren't allowed to watch each other's kids on the weekend.
[00:43:55.385 --> 00:43:56.926]  Even the cops are slaves.
[00:43:56.926 --> 00:43:58.767]  That's how this works.
[00:43:58.767 --> 00:44:00.849]  I mean, it's just total hell being released.
[00:44:00.849 --> 00:44:02.990]  Okay, I'm gonna take some calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.752]  We're gonna move quickly.
[00:44:06.752 --> 00:44:08.133]  Tim in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:44:08.133 --> 00:44:10.895]  Hey Alex, love your show.
[00:44:10.895 --> 00:44:13.537]  Like your take on why this Michael Moore
[00:44:14.417 --> 00:44:19.318]  Capitalism movie is so popular and I've read an article about that.
[00:44:19.318 --> 00:44:20.159]  That's all hype.
[00:44:20.159 --> 00:44:21.639]  It's his greatest failure.
[00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:25.500]  It's the lowest grossing documentary he's ever released.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:30.181]  Bowling for Columbine, Sicko, Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:44:30.181 --> 00:44:31.302]  It's a giant failure.
[00:44:32.282 --> 00:44:36.125]  And, um, again, they're blaming capitalism.
[00:44:36.125 --> 00:44:37.385]  This isn't capitalism.
[00:44:37.385 --> 00:44:39.067]  This is corporate communism.
[00:44:39.067 --> 00:44:40.367]  This is robbery.
[00:44:40.367 --> 00:44:41.288]  This is piracy.
[00:44:41.288 --> 00:44:48.032]  But they have to blame the free market because now they're bringing in the global tyranny.
[00:44:48.032 --> 00:44:59.039]  Well, why is, uh, why doesn't he get all his attention in the news and your documentaries, which are fantastic, get absolutely, you know, very little attention in the news media?
[00:44:59.039 --> 00:44:59.940]  I don't understand that.
[00:45:02.403 --> 00:45:05.924]  Because Michael Moore reaffirms the left-right paradigm.
[00:45:05.924 --> 00:45:08.265]  He makes the left good, the right bad.
[00:45:08.265 --> 00:45:13.666]  He divides the people instead of going, hey, left and right are both owned by this offshore bank.
[00:45:13.666 --> 00:45:25.150]  See, we're like rats in a maze, and they've done university studies on this, where there's big contained mazes that have, you know, hundreds and hundreds of square feet.
[00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.751]  There's different layers, different levels.
[00:45:27.751 --> 00:45:29.171]  The rats overproduce.
[00:45:29.171 --> 00:45:30.632]  They have wars.
[00:45:30.632 --> 00:45:31.392]  They never know.
[00:45:33.211 --> 00:45:36.454]  That they can get out of there.
[00:45:36.454 --> 00:45:43.639]  And generations go on inside these mazes that have artificial light in them, and that's the end of it.
[00:45:43.639 --> 00:45:44.560]  And it's the same thing.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:57.371]  We live in this artificial matrix of false political ideas, and everything is about making you believe the President really has the power, and the President's really doing it, and oh, the President's fighting with the Pentagon as if he runs anything.
[00:45:57.371 --> 00:45:59.953]  It's all for outward consumption.
[00:46:01.052 --> 00:46:02.032]  But you're right.
[00:46:02.032 --> 00:46:05.594]  The way the media behaves, this is the most hype I've ever seen for one of his movies.
[00:46:05.594 --> 00:46:08.515]  Blaming capitalism.
[00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:13.076]  It's a private group of banks, of hucksters, of con men.
[00:46:13.076 --> 00:46:19.979]  That's not free market.
[00:46:19.979 --> 00:46:29.422]  I tell people about your documentaries, Alex, and especially recently, and I get this feedback from people that I watch the new Michael Moore Show.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.443]  And they just are clueless about what's really happening.
[00:46:34.443 --> 00:46:40.927]  And I come from out of left field in their little world and they don't hardly understand.
[00:46:43.766 --> 00:46:48.087]  Well, Germans didn't know Hitler was bad in 38, but they knew by 40.
[00:46:48.087 --> 00:46:49.767]  And so, just keep planting the seeds.
[00:46:49.767 --> 00:46:51.427]  I appreciate your call.
[00:46:51.427 --> 00:46:55.508]  And just explain to them that Obama is the same as Bush.
[00:46:55.508 --> 00:47:01.609]  Keeping the Patriot Act, expanding secret arrests, hiring nothing but lobbyists, expanding wars.
[00:47:01.609 --> 00:47:05.710]  Then they have the Pentagon come in and criticize him for not expanding it enough.
[00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.171]  That gives him left cover.
[00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:08.991]  It's a simple con game.
[00:47:10.017 --> 00:47:14.739]  It's like when you're at the carnival and one car and he goes, Hey buddy, you look like a wimp.
[00:47:14.739 --> 00:47:16.639]  You're afraid to try to pitch.
[00:47:16.639 --> 00:47:19.000]  And the guy next to him goes, I don't listen to him.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.700]  I'm your friend.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:20.520]  Come on over here.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:20.840]  Yeah.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.021]  You're going to win at this.
[00:47:22.021 --> 00:47:25.382]  It's called good cop, bad cop.
[00:47:25.382 --> 00:47:26.882]  Let's talk to Mike in Tennessee.
[00:47:26.882 --> 00:47:28.703]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:47:28.703 --> 00:47:29.843]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:47:29.843 --> 00:47:31.424]  Hey buddy.
[00:47:31.424 --> 00:47:38.006]  Being one of the first cities, Memphis, Tennessee to receive the, uh, swine flu shots in the nasal mist here locally.
[00:47:38.661 --> 00:47:45.504]  One of the premier research hospitals, Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, where you take your kids if they're really sick.
[00:47:45.504 --> 00:47:58.009]  They had a girl on the news yesterday saying she worked in the prenatal care and she's so glad that she's one of the first to get the nasal spray because she's working with the sickest of the sick children.
[00:47:58.009 --> 00:48:05.171]  Little does she know, if she sneezes, she's infecting all of these children with every breath.
[00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:05.892]  And if the kids die?
[00:48:07.935 --> 00:48:12.957]  They'll use it and hype it and say, oh, swine flu got into the hospital.
[00:48:12.957 --> 00:48:14.758]  See how it works for them?
[00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:15.298]  Right.
[00:48:15.298 --> 00:48:16.579]  It builds under the propaganda.
[00:48:16.579 --> 00:48:24.662]  They've already had three children that, and the mainstream media here, the government media as I call it now, they say, three children now died of the swine flu.
[00:48:24.662 --> 00:48:29.825]  And then they say, the hospital says these children died of complications while they had the swine flu.
[00:48:30.515 --> 00:48:31.035]  What killed him?
[00:48:31.035 --> 00:48:32.956]  The swine flu or the complications?
[00:48:32.956 --> 00:48:34.137]  The complications.
[00:48:34.137 --> 00:48:35.838]  Well did you hear about Bill Gates?
[00:48:35.838 --> 00:48:39.760]  A caller called last week and I looked it up and confirmed it.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:59.231]  He gives a standard speech hundreds of times a year to community groups and sometimes he releases mosquitoes in the audience and says I want to put vaccines in mosquitoes and he tells you how great the mosquito you know all these vaccines are and how he loves you and he just so happens to be for eugenics but that's okay trust him but Bill Gates
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:01.440]  I don't
[00:49:19.502 --> 00:49:22.763]  Polio vaccine is what's giving the kids polio.
[00:49:22.763 --> 00:49:23.943]  That's confirmed.
[00:49:23.943 --> 00:49:25.624]  And see, it's the same thing with this.
[00:49:25.624 --> 00:49:28.065]  They come out with a polio vaccine.
[00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.645]  It kills you or makes you sick.
[00:49:29.645 --> 00:49:32.346]  They hype, oh, see, we need more injections.
[00:49:32.346 --> 00:49:33.506]  It's the same thing with the flu.
[00:49:33.506 --> 00:49:35.887]  Oh, we're going to put live flu into your nasal passage.
[00:49:35.887 --> 00:49:39.248]  They admit it's going to breed it, but only in the fine print.
[00:49:39.248 --> 00:49:41.129]  Shepard Smith calls it a conspiracy theory.
[00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:47.631]  Well you just watch, yeah, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas are the three places they're starting the nasal sprays.
[00:49:47.631 --> 00:49:51.953]  And watch, no one will be able to put two and two together when the big outbreaks happen there.
[00:49:51.953 --> 00:49:54.714]  Everyone will just love the government as usual.
[00:49:54.714 --> 00:50:08.318]  Once they inject, once they spray it in your nostril, they say for 20 days you're able to shed the virus because of your, well if you sneeze or exhale, the particles can come out through your nostrils and you can put them out into the atmosphere for other people to breathe.
[00:50:08.318 --> 00:50:09.739]  Yeah, notice, notice what they're doing.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:20.768]  Right as they're about to come out with the 200 million dosages, they first go, oh, we're going to do nasal live virus first in 10 million people.
[00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:23.490]  And then they admit, oh, it will spread it.
[00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.851]  They just admit it.
[00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:26.332]  So see, there it is.
[00:50:26.332 --> 00:50:29.934]  They release it, they spread it, then they forcibly inoculate.
[00:50:29.934 --> 00:50:31.776]  And they do it right out in front of everybody, Mike.
[00:50:32.912 --> 00:50:34.333]  Stay there, I want to talk about this with you Mike.
[00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:34.713]  It's a cult.
[00:50:34.713 --> 00:50:41.756]  Look, the Aztecs would lead their children up to the pit to have their heart cut out and would be very prideful, according to the Cortez who saw this, of their kid being killed.

[00:52:02.614 --> 00:52:05.436]  A new world order.
[00:52:05.436 --> 00:52:09.977]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:09.977 --> 00:52:13.159]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:13.159 --> 00:52:15.940]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.341]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:19.116 --> 00:52:29.492]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:29.492 --> 00:52:34.439]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[00:52:42.503 --> 00:52:43.284]  They're not after money.
[00:52:43.284 --> 00:52:44.564]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:44.564 --> 00:52:45.565]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.565 --> 00:52:46.706]  That's what they're after.

[00:53:29.631 --> 00:53:30.191]  We're good.
[00:54:08.206 --> 00:54:13.649]  Well, later in the next hour, I'm going to go over the Mayo Clinic's own announcements.
[00:54:13.649 --> 00:54:19.193]  The inserts for the live flu H1N1 nasal spray admitting it's live.
[00:54:19.193 --> 00:54:23.395]  It's supposedly been weakened, but it can mutate and can spread it.
[00:54:23.395 --> 00:54:30.879]  And yeah, they're doing this in hospitals first, so that can be a perfect incubating ground in these sick hospitals, these sick buildings as they're called.
[00:54:30.879 --> 00:54:33.261]  I'm going to go back to Mike and everybody else that's holding.
[00:54:33.261 --> 00:54:34.502]  Mike Rivero's coming up.
[00:54:35.602 --> 00:54:38.763]  And we've also got the folks from Camp FEMA on, but I can only get him in this segment.
[00:54:38.763 --> 00:54:41.824]  The next, he's got a meeting he's got to go to on short notice.
[00:54:41.824 --> 00:54:48.605]  He's the Executive Director of Gun Owners of America, the premier Second Amendment no-compromise group.
[00:54:48.605 --> 00:54:54.827]  We see fights in Montana with the feds saying they can't produce their own guns there, even though that violates the Tenth Amendment.
[00:54:54.827 --> 00:55:03.189]  We see fights for the Second Amendment in Pennsylvania, but none of those are as important as California wants you to biometrically thumbprint
[00:55:04.099 --> 00:55:09.840]  to be able to buy ammo and it's and it's they're saying the governor should sign legislation requiring I.D.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.340]  and thumbprint to purchase handgun ammo.
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:19.402]  Now the feds want this and California is the seventh biggest economy in the world that's about twenty five percent of the U.S.
[00:55:19.402 --> 00:55:30.284]  economy roughly and growing and that sets precedence for cars for for standardization for biometrics on guns they've already gotten that passed they're killing the gun industry
[00:55:31.204 --> 00:55:32.925]  And they want their slaves disarmed.
[00:55:32.925 --> 00:55:35.145]  So Larry Pratt joins us to break this down.
[00:55:35.145 --> 00:55:44.948]  The LA Times says, hey, they want you to biometrically scan to do this, and the Democrats want you to thumb scan when you buy a hamburger or something fattening to pay a carbon footprint.
[00:55:44.948 --> 00:55:49.410]  So this is the thumb scanning to buy and sell, not just to get your ammo.
[00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:50.570]  Larry Pratt.
[00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:51.911]  Alex, you know, there's one thing.
[00:55:51.911 --> 00:55:58.113]  They're not going to make us thumb scan on or use any kind of biometric, or for that matter, any
[00:55:59.612 --> 00:55:59.932]  I don't
[00:56:17.637 --> 00:56:22.659]  Sitting, waiting day after day for this free service.
[00:56:22.659 --> 00:56:26.820]  Gee, we won't even have to worry about buying ammo, because we won't be going anywhere!
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.821]  Exactly!
[00:56:27.821 --> 00:56:39.265]  I'll tell you what, I was in California this weekend, last weekend, and I heard that for every person that comes into the state to live, eight are leaving.
[00:56:39.265 --> 00:56:42.886]  So they're not all goofy, and some of them are getting out while they can,
[00:56:43.308 --> 00:56:49.214]  Because it's entirely possible that that may be the first state to go kaboom, just implode.
[00:56:49.214 --> 00:56:53.518]  Well the London Guardian did an analysis and said it's already the first failed state.
[00:56:53.518 --> 00:56:59.264]  And their answer is more government, more sucking off the producers, it's over for California.
[00:56:59.264 --> 00:57:05.510]  There was a guy at the conference that I spoke to that came up to me and he said, I got a tax refund.
[00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:06.751]  They sent me an IOU.
[00:57:10.355 --> 00:57:11.996]  I said, you don't look good in blue.
[00:57:11.996 --> 00:57:14.196]  I hope you're not holding your breath waiting for that.
[00:57:14.196 --> 00:57:21.258]  But I guess that's the best we can ask for, is like the Soviet Union, if the big government would just at least collapse, then we could get our country back.
[00:57:21.258 --> 00:57:23.499]  That, I think, is what it will take.
[00:57:23.499 --> 00:57:27.119]  Apparently, they're not willing to put a zero in any of the budgets.
[00:57:27.119 --> 00:57:32.861]  They're not willing to tell the unions in the state, like Obama didn't want to tell the unions at General Motors.
[00:57:33.291 --> 00:57:36.753]  You guys have been killing the goose that lays the golden egg.
[00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:39.074]  Why do you think business is going abroad?
[00:57:39.074 --> 00:57:41.455]  It's because of this kind of insanity.
[00:57:41.455 --> 00:57:44.936]  Well, I don't mind if California government goes abroad.
[00:57:44.936 --> 00:57:46.597]  Goodbye.
[00:57:46.597 --> 00:57:49.178]  Send it to China and China would fold real quick.
[00:57:49.178 --> 00:57:50.079]  Larry, we're going to go to break.
[00:57:50.079 --> 00:57:52.160]  We've got five minutes left with you.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.020]  But start now.
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:56.722]  Tell us about this draconian thumb-printing to get it to buy ammo.
[00:57:56.722 --> 00:57:59.643]  Well, it's on a bill that's on the governor's desk and he
[00:58:01.204 --> 00:58:08.571]  Hopefully will not, and anybody listening who's in California should call the Terminator and tell him no.
[00:58:08.571 --> 00:58:13.056]  This is a really dangerous precedent, not just for people buying ammo.
[00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:25.648]  Hey, right now they can still go over to Arizona, go over to Nevada, they can buy all the ammo they want, but it means that we will have set a precedent that to exercise a constitutional right
[00:58:26.212 --> 00:58:28.393]  We have to be screened?
[00:58:28.393 --> 00:58:32.695]  That is really... Yeah, that's guilty until proven innocent, but it does something else.
[00:58:32.695 --> 00:58:37.037]  You know, next they're gonna make it illegal not having ammo that was bought in the state.
[00:58:37.037 --> 00:58:39.038]  And then they're criminalizing non-criminals.
[00:58:39.038 --> 00:58:42.180]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:45.802]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.802 --> 00:58:47.643]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:54.574]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.574 --> 00:58:56.596]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.596 --> 00:59:05.105]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.105 --> 00:59:10.670]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:12.292]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.512 --> 00:59:19.036]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.036 --> 00:59:30.083]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.083 --> 00:59:31.464]  That's right, clean water.
[00:59:31.764 --> 00:59:33.405]  Right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.405 --> 00:59:37.567]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[00:59:53.376 --> 00:59:55.757]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.757 --> 00:59:58.539]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:09.998]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.998 --> 01:00:11.580]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.122]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.122 --> 01:00:17.328]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.328 --> 01:00:21.393]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:32.469]  Barack Obama, his Attorney General, and the rest of his criminal crew are all on record in federal cases and state cases saying absolute abolition of individual ownership of guns.
[01:00:32.469 --> 01:00:35.950]  That's why Obama's the greatest gun salesman the United States has ever seen.
[01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:39.392]  Many gun stores, as Larry was telling me during the break, have that sign up.
[01:00:39.392 --> 01:00:41.372]  In fact, I've seen it myself buying ammo.
[01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:48.935]  Back to California, so it's on the governor's desk, he's waffling, people need to call him, say, don't do this, don't make us register to buy ammo.
[01:00:49.895 --> 01:00:51.916]  Don't make us slaves.
[01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:56.838]  Finishing up with that, Larry, in the last four minutes we've got here, other gun battles going on.
[01:00:56.838 --> 01:01:06.021]  Well, you mentioned the primary one in my mind, and that's Montana, and I'm sure it will be soon in Tennessee as well.
[01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:15.905]  Montana, a lawsuit has been actually filed against the reaction of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a.k.a.
[01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:16.365]  the gang,
[01:01:17.451 --> 01:01:30.339]  They sent a letter to all the registered firearms manufacturers and dealers in the state of Montana and Tennessee saying we don't recognize your stinking state law.
[01:01:30.339 --> 01:01:35.082]  Federal law is supreme and therefore dropped dead.
[01:01:35.082 --> 01:01:39.405]  Well, the answer is they've written to the wrong people.
[01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:44.348]  The people that have licenses were compelled unconstitutionally to get these licenses
[01:01:45.342 --> 01:01:49.624]  In order to go into business, because they didn't have a state law to protect them.
[01:01:49.624 --> 01:01:53.206]  But the two states, Montana and Tennessee, do.
[01:01:53.206 --> 01:01:57.588]  And I think what's going to happen is they're going to lose in federal court, probably.
[01:01:57.588 --> 01:02:04.031]  Most times, federal court rules in favor of the continued unconstitutional growth of the federal government.
[01:02:04.031 --> 01:02:07.272]  But that doesn't end the matter.
[01:02:07.272 --> 01:02:13.255]  And it could really come down to what the sheriff is willing and able to do.
[01:02:13.255 --> 01:02:14.496]  I'll give you an example from
[01:02:15.191 --> 01:02:24.073]  Just a few years ago in Franklin County, Tennessee, interestingly one of the freedom states already, there was a fire in a barn.
[01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.073]  There was a lot of powder and ammo.
[01:02:26.073 --> 01:02:30.654]  The fire department was out there on the scene, even a couple of sheriff's deputies.
[01:02:30.654 --> 01:02:38.096]  And before too long, a couple of FBI agents come sauntering on the property and announce that they're there to take over the investigation.
[01:02:38.096 --> 01:02:40.256]  And the deputies say, what investigation?
[01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:44.114]  Well, yeah, there's ammo involved, so we're here to take over the investigation.
[01:02:44.114 --> 01:02:49.079]  So they called their boss, because they knew the sheriff wasn't a real fan of federal agents.
[01:02:49.079 --> 01:02:58.968]  He came right out, found out that, yep, that's what these guys were doing, and said, well, look, if you really insist on doing this investigation, I can give you some office space in my building downtown.
[01:02:58.968 --> 01:02:59.448]  No, that's fine.
[01:02:59.448 --> 01:03:01.530]  We're just here to do the investigation right here.
[01:03:02.096 --> 01:03:04.578]  And he said, okay, I didn't explain myself well enough.
[01:03:04.578 --> 01:03:10.023]  You either get out of my county right now, or you're going into a 4x8 cell in my jail.
[01:03:10.023 --> 01:03:12.746]  Well, they didn't cotton nicely to that.
[01:03:12.746 --> 01:03:15.569]  They called their supervisor to find out what they should do.
[01:03:15.569 --> 01:03:16.309]  This is key.
[01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:22.295]  The guy said, the FBI supervisor told them, a sheriff, which means any sheriff,
[01:03:22.779 --> 01:03:26.282]  He can do that, and knowing that, Sheriff, he probably will.
[01:03:26.282 --> 01:03:28.223]  That's how I think it's going to come down.
[01:03:28.223 --> 01:03:29.945]  And of course, that was always known.
[01:03:29.945 --> 01:03:38.632]  We have to re-exercise that right instead of Obama and these fusion centers, which are a total federalization and takeover of our local communities.
[01:03:38.632 --> 01:03:39.672]  Go ahead.
[01:03:39.672 --> 01:03:40.893]  That's exactly right.
[01:03:40.893 --> 01:03:47.459]  When we go vote, especially probably next year, many sheriffs will be up on the ballot.
[01:03:47.459 --> 01:03:49.600]  If not, probably two to four years following.
[01:03:50.879 --> 01:03:58.824]  It's really essential that we ask them, would you enforce a state law like Montana's or Tennessee's?
[01:03:58.824 --> 01:04:01.926]  And explain to them if they haven't heard of it and get their answer.
[01:04:01.926 --> 01:04:04.327]  It's not enough to say, well, I'm for the Second Amendment.
[01:04:04.327 --> 01:04:07.229]  Well, golly, Senators, Schumer says that.
[01:04:07.229 --> 01:04:08.910]  That doesn't tell me anything.
[01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:12.672]  I want to know what they will do in that specific situation.
[01:04:12.672 --> 01:04:17.275]  And if they will do what that Franklin County, Tennessee Sheriff was willing to do,
[01:04:18.019 --> 01:04:22.517]  uh... then i think we've got the country coming back to where it belongs we've seen
[01:04:23.295 --> 01:04:26.678]  The same reaction on the national ID card.
[01:04:26.678 --> 01:04:29.600]  A number of states have said, no way, Jose.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.701]  No info.
[01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:32.482]  Going to Washington for that.
[01:04:32.482 --> 01:04:34.223]  Our bureaucrats go to jail before you do.
[01:04:34.223 --> 01:04:34.904]  Absolutely.
[01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:37.526]  Larry, I've got to get you back up soon for a full hour.
[01:04:37.526 --> 01:04:39.147]  Thank you for your time on short notice.
[01:04:39.147 --> 01:04:40.628]  Gunowners.org.
[01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:44.511]  Join it, or at least sign up for the free email alerts right there on the site.
[01:04:44.511 --> 01:04:47.213]  We've got to take the local government over.
[01:04:47.213 --> 01:04:49.934]  That's where the globalists are taking over our society.
[01:04:49.934 --> 01:04:51.376]  Great advice, Larry Pratt.
[01:04:51.376 --> 01:04:51.956]  God bless you.
[01:04:52.116 --> 01:04:52.756]  You too, Alex.
[01:04:52.756 --> 01:04:53.257]  Thank you much.
[01:04:53.257 --> 01:04:54.217]  Thank you for being with us.
[01:04:54.217 --> 01:05:00.340]  We'll be right back with Mike Rivero joining us from Hawaii via video cam.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:05.642]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.642 --> 01:05:10.165]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.165 --> 01:05:12.446]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.446 --> 01:05:14.066]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.066 --> 01:05:15.107]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.327 --> 01:05:23.756]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:05:23.756 --> 01:05:31.224]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:05:31.224 --> 01:05:36.890]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:43.274]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:05:43.274 --> 01:05:47.417]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:54.882]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.

[01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:03.637]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:06:03.637 --> 01:06:07.238]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:06:07.238 --> 01:06:11.820]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:17.422]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.702 --> 01:06:22.486]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.486 --> 01:06:26.109]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:30.933]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:30.933 --> 01:06:37.499]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.499 --> 01:06:39.441]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:39.921 --> 01:06:43.122]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:06:43.122 --> 01:06:47.624]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[01:06:47.624 --> 01:06:49.845]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.

[01:06:50.146 --> 01:06:50.846]  Don't wait, call today!
[01:07:00.626 --> 01:07:06.229]  You've heard the Get The Tea commercials, and many people like our commercials, but I did notice something.
[01:07:06.229 --> 01:07:07.690]  What the heck is a toxin?
[01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.011]  So, here it is.
[01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:15.215]  A toxin is a poisonous substance that is capable of causing disease when introduced into the body.
[01:07:15.215 --> 01:07:18.457]  Formaldehyde, from seat cushions and particle board.
[01:07:18.457 --> 01:07:25.221]  How about carbon monoxide, furnace-burning propane, butane, disinfectants, perfume,
[01:07:25.774 --> 01:07:26.754]  Mouthwash?
[01:07:26.754 --> 01:07:27.655]  Glues?
[01:07:27.655 --> 01:07:28.535]  Air fresheners?
[01:07:28.535 --> 01:07:29.375]  Pesticides?
[01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:32.737]  Oh my gosh, even sugar is a toxin according to Dr. Lau!
[01:07:32.737 --> 01:07:34.597]  It's a very addictive drug!
[01:07:34.597 --> 01:07:36.858]  It's time to fight back!
[01:07:36.858 --> 01:07:39.379]  GetTheTea.com!
[01:07:39.379 --> 01:07:41.320]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.621]  Or you can get your trusty cell phone out and call us at 928-308-0408.
[01:07:47.482 --> 01:07:53.365]  Again, 928-308-0408 and put in your order today.
[01:07:53.365 --> 01:07:58.227]  Lose weight, feel good, and be free of all these toxins.
[01:07:58.227 --> 01:08:01.749]  Get the T dot com.
[01:08:01.749 --> 01:08:07.331]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:20.473]  With us, 5-10 minutes into the next hour with his monthly visit is Mike Rivero, fellow talk show host here on Genesis.
[01:08:20.473 --> 01:08:23.354]  We're going to go to him in one moment to get into the flu.
[01:08:23.354 --> 01:08:29.357]  His perspective on that, always enjoy getting his interesting take on things, very well informed.
[01:08:29.357 --> 01:08:32.999]  And we've got William Lewis, Gary Franchi later in the next hour joining us.
[01:08:32.999 --> 01:08:36.141]  How the Hardin, Montana, with the biggest developments yet coming out on this.
[01:08:37.523 --> 01:08:40.044]  How that ties into their film, Camp FEMA.
[01:08:40.044 --> 01:08:41.685]  That's going to be very, very informative.
[01:08:41.685 --> 01:08:45.387]  And we'll continue with open phones in the fourth hour today.
[01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:50.950]  There is a key story up on PrisonPlanet.com that I worked on with Paul Watson.
[01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:55.292]  It's doctors concerned flu-miss vaccine could spread live H1N1 virus.
[01:08:55.292 --> 01:08:57.334]  Now, people, the COINTELPRO,
[01:08:58.274 --> 01:09:01.557]  Always accuse me of exaggerating or trying to scare people.
[01:09:01.557 --> 01:09:03.419]  No, it's actually much scarier.
[01:09:03.419 --> 01:09:15.650]  If you read what the Mayo Clinic said, and all these other mainstream documents, and the inserts, and what Fox News is even saying, no, they admit it will spread the virus.
[01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:20.034]  And it's a live virus, and it will mutate, and some will be weaker, some will be stronger.
[01:09:20.034 --> 01:09:21.876]  So see, Watson gave that a weak headline.
[01:09:24.386 --> 01:09:26.447]  Nine times out of ten we do.
[01:09:26.447 --> 01:09:29.890]  It's worse than this headline, but this article's got all the facts.
[01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:31.191]  It needs to be gotten out.
[01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:33.933]  Doctors concerned flu-miss vaccine could spread live H1N1 virus.
[01:09:35.987 --> 01:09:37.007]  Well, 60% of the U.S.
[01:09:37.007 --> 01:09:41.289]  population at risk is swine flu, nasal spray, a pandemic waiting to happen.
[01:09:41.289 --> 01:09:42.790]  Now, Mike got cut off.
[01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:49.472]  I promised to go to Mike, a listener from Tennessee, about neighbors like it's a rock star, it's a fad, or ooh, they're getting it.
[01:09:49.472 --> 01:09:55.695]  Oh yeah, and when your kids get brain damaged, it's like a fad, you know, for the breast cancer, a fad for the autism, or a fad for
[01:09:57.022 --> 01:09:59.523]  You know, a third of the kids in my neighborhood are dying of cancer.
[01:09:59.523 --> 01:10:02.105]  You know, people in my office that I know are dying of cancer.
[01:10:02.105 --> 01:10:04.986]  Their girlfriends are dying of cancer.
[01:10:04.986 --> 01:10:09.829]  Rob Dues, 30-something-year-old friend, been in a band with him for 10 years, she just died of cancer last week.
[01:10:09.829 --> 01:10:17.173]  Just, you know, oh, but we have meetings about it, and we talk about it, and we make it all fancy and fun, and how about we stop taking their shots?
[01:10:17.173 --> 01:10:20.694]  See, because it's not my opinion they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[01:10:20.694 --> 01:10:21.935]  They said they'd do it.
[01:10:21.935 --> 01:10:23.436]  It's in the government documents.
[01:10:23.436 --> 01:10:24.396]  It's in eco-science.
[01:10:24.396 --> 01:10:25.417]  They're poisoning our water.
[01:10:26.482 --> 01:10:30.883]  I mean, look, the reason they're getting away with this is the horror factor.
[01:10:30.883 --> 01:10:32.084]  No one can deal with that.
[01:10:32.084 --> 01:10:35.405]  It's hard for me to deal with that they're doing this.
[01:10:35.405 --> 01:10:42.307]  The only reason they don't kill me is because they know I'm telling an extremely accurate representation of what's really going on.
[01:10:42.307 --> 01:10:44.608]  I'm not perfect, but I got a good picture on me.
[01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:47.649]  My scope's got them in the sights.
[01:10:47.649 --> 01:10:54.791]  And they sure don't want to kill me and make a big example out of it, folks, because I'm dead on with what they're doing because I read their textbooks.
[01:10:56.015 --> 01:10:59.760]  Let me tell you, I mean, I spend hours every day researching what I talk about here.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.305]  And let me tell you, there's no going back once you know this.
[01:11:03.305 --> 01:11:07.911]  Then you can't even hate the cops when they violate the First Amendment and say no protest allowed in D.C.
[01:11:07.911 --> 01:11:11.696]  or Pittsburgh and beat women in the head and have police dogs attack women.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:23.592]  You don't like them, you're angry at them, you think they're thugs, but you know those idiots are drinking sodium fluoride water, they're taking vaccines, their kids are taking it, you want to save them!
[01:11:23.592 --> 01:11:32.902]  You want to stop fighting with them and reach out to them and splash some cold water in their face psychologically and say, look, look at what we're saying!
[01:11:34.844 --> 01:11:43.471]  Live flu virus is the first vaccine they're putting out, admitting it will spread the real flu, then it creates all this fear that everybody gets the shot.
[01:11:43.471 --> 01:11:44.312]  It's hidden in plain view.
[01:11:44.312 --> 01:11:47.955]  I'm going to get Mike Rivero's take on that in a moment, but I promise to go to Mike in Tennessee.
[01:11:47.955 --> 01:11:49.996]  Mike, finish the point you were trying to make.
[01:11:49.996 --> 01:11:51.317]  Go ahead.
[01:11:51.317 --> 01:11:59.824]  Well, real quick, this lady that I spoke to today, she was talking, she's always getting the flu shot and she can't wait to get her child the swine flu shot.
[01:11:59.824 --> 01:12:04.388]  Talked about she wanted her child, she always gets her child everything, anything they say that she needs.
[01:12:04.804 --> 01:12:11.567]  She's the first one in line to get it as though it's somewhat like an accessory, a purse, a new pair of shoes or something.
[01:12:11.567 --> 01:12:29.034]  And today in this, uh, one of the dying papers around the country, the Commercial Appeal, the article in here talks about the lady who tilted her head back, the first person in the country to get the swine flu sniffer, says she tilted her head back and sniffed hard and became the first American to be given the H1N1 flu vaccine.
[01:12:29.034 --> 01:12:30.835]  And then real quick, and I know you gotta go,
[01:12:31.863 --> 01:12:49.735]  On the intersection, buried in the paper, the part that you probably wouldn't read unless you're like me and you read every bit of this, it says workers at Le Bonheur who received the vaccine Monday had to sign a consent form and were given a CDC card proving they were given the drug.
[01:12:49.735 --> 01:12:52.056]  A CDC card to prove it.
[01:12:52.056 --> 01:12:53.337]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:12:53.337 --> 01:12:56.419]  We covered this yesterday and this is all admitted.
[01:12:56.419 --> 01:12:57.400]  AP, Reuters.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.661]  I'm going to go back over to Mike Rivera coming up.
[01:12:59.661 --> 01:13:00.502]  We're going to Mike right now.
[01:13:01.932 --> 01:13:12.923]  They admit that it's a live virus, that the perfect place for it to breed and mutate is the nasal passages and the mucous membranes of the sinus.
[01:13:12.923 --> 01:13:13.643]  Sinus is huge.
[01:13:13.643 --> 01:13:16.566]  It sits up underneath the brain.
[01:13:16.566 --> 01:13:19.409]  The sinus is very large.
[01:13:19.409 --> 01:13:22.592]  But the point is, in fact, maybe we should pull up a Google image of the sinus.
[01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:28.927]  And let people see how it sits behind the nose right underneath the brain.
[01:13:28.927 --> 01:13:34.690]  They pump it in there, it breathes, and then they admit that no H1N1 trials were done.
[01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:39.953]  I have those headlines that the trial is the people being given the live mutating virus.
[01:13:44.015 --> 01:13:49.500]  It's so huge, it's so obvious, it's so out in the open, and now it's going to spread everywhere.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:52.703]  People kept saying, this is very weak, this isn't killing hardly anybody.
[01:13:52.703 --> 01:13:56.105]  This is, on the scale, much weaker than the regular seasonal flu.
[01:13:56.105 --> 01:13:56.986]  Why all the fear?
[01:13:56.986 --> 01:13:58.928]  Because they're going to spread it and mutate it.
[01:13:58.928 --> 01:13:59.909]  Let's go to Mike Rivera.
[01:13:59.909 --> 01:14:01.310]  Mike, what do you think about what's happening?
[01:14:02.099 --> 01:14:12.208]  Well, it's a very dangerous and reckless approach to this kind of a medical situation, and over at WhatReallyHappened.com, we just posted an article from one of the German newspapers, German magazines.
[01:14:12.208 --> 01:14:19.394]  They're basically saying the same thing, that if you get the swine flu vaccine, it will make you more likely to come down with the swine flu.
[01:14:19.394 --> 01:14:20.695]  And that seems to be counterproductive.
[01:14:20.695 --> 01:14:21.776]  Well, that's actually the CDC.
[01:14:21.776 --> 01:14:25.059]  The CDC says if you take the swine flu shot, you're more likely to get it.
[01:14:25.059 --> 01:14:27.040]  I mean, I have that in my stack.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:27.701]  That's what I mean.
[01:14:27.701 --> 01:14:28.342]  This is insane!
[01:14:29.406 --> 01:14:34.753]  It absolutely is, and without even getting into the question of possible motives, at this point I don't even really care.
[01:14:34.753 --> 01:14:42.783]  You go back and you look at the swine flu epidemic and vaccination of 1976, the vaccine killed 50 times as many people as the flu itself did.
[01:14:42.783 --> 01:14:44.185]  This is nonsense.
[01:14:44.185 --> 01:14:45.827]  It is reckless beyond belief.
[01:14:45.827 --> 01:14:47.109]  They're not testing this stuff.
[01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:54.817]  And remember, only last year, Baxter allowed a test vaccine out for trials that had live bird flu virus in it.
[01:14:54.817 --> 01:15:01.125]  We don't know if this is the one that was being used up in Norway when they did some tests on some homeless people and a bunch of those people died.
[01:15:02.386 --> 01:15:07.147]  But I mean, obviously something was being tested in Norway that killed a bunch of people.
[01:15:07.147 --> 01:15:18.010]  And it's reckless and it's dangerous, but it's hugely profitable for the pharmaceutical companies who've all made the appropriate tithing to their local congressmen, congressional campaigns.
[01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:20.870]  And it's simply peddling snake oil.
[01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:28.572]  I mean, our current medical establishment in the United States is operating on the same moral and ethical level as the old Wild West traveling medicine show salesman.
[01:15:29.332 --> 01:15:37.034]  Ride the wagon into town, crank down the stage, do a song and dance, make all kinds of claims and sell bottles full of whatever they found out in the desert.
[01:15:37.034 --> 01:15:41.235]  And you're lucky if it doesn't kill you, let alone actually help you in any way, shape or form.
[01:15:41.235 --> 01:15:42.935]  That's where we are.
[01:15:42.935 --> 01:15:51.017]  We're finding out just yesterday that after decades of all this fluoridation of tap water, it doesn't really have any effect on dental cavities at all.
[01:15:51.017 --> 01:15:52.357]  So why are they putting it in there?
[01:15:52.357 --> 01:15:55.858]  Well, because they need to get rid of the waste product and they can make money doing it.
[01:15:56.198 --> 01:15:58.540]  And it makes people docile in all the studies.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:03.483]  Actually, two years ago, the American Dental Association said, don't have kids, brush their teeth.
[01:16:03.483 --> 01:16:10.988]  It causes fractures in the teeth and dental fluorosis and doubles bone cancer of just one type in boys.
[01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:12.970]  And all the other studies show all these other cancers.
[01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:15.211]  I mean, this is not debatable.
[01:16:15.211 --> 01:16:15.892]  This is a fact.
[01:16:15.892 --> 01:16:18.353]  And you mentioned the stuff in Norway.
[01:16:18.353 --> 01:16:20.155]  The London Telegraph reported that in Poland,
[01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:29.282]  21 of 100 homeless people in a bird flu vaccine trial all died, and that it was an unnamed pharmaceutical company.
[01:16:29.282 --> 01:16:44.734]  So that's confirmed that that was a... But I mean, to see Shepard Smith on Fox saying, it's a conspiracy theory, the swine flu shot cannot hurt you, when I have the insert of the five big makers, every one of the inserts says, Gillian Beret.
[01:16:45.796 --> 01:16:48.238]  Am I pronouncing that right, or Guillain-Barré?
[01:16:48.238 --> 01:16:50.580]  Guillain-Barré.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.681]  I mean, I have these.
[01:16:51.681 --> 01:16:52.761]  I'll show them again coming up.
[01:16:52.761 --> 01:16:55.363]  I'll show, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, scans.
[01:16:55.363 --> 01:16:58.006]  They're admitting it causes autoimmune problems.
[01:16:58.006 --> 01:16:59.887]  It's admitting it can give you cancer.
[01:16:59.887 --> 01:17:03.910]  It says on the insert it can sterilize you or reduce fertility.
[01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:10.956]  I mean, how can Shepard Smith and the rest of TV say it cannot hurt you, knowing it's going to mess a bunch of people up?
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.663]  They were saying the exact same thing back in 1976.
[01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:26.581]  If you go out on YouTube somebody's put up a video of all the propaganda that was hitting the television airwaves in 1976 about how important it was to get the shot and how it was going to save your life and make you better and of course the exact...
[01:17:27.422 --> 01:17:32.945]  It's all about selling product and they don't really care what it does.
[01:17:32.945 --> 01:17:36.186]  Once it goes out, they've made their money, they don't care.
[01:17:36.186 --> 01:17:37.907]  And the stuff is incredibly dangerous.
[01:17:37.907 --> 01:17:39.968]  They're not testing it fully.
[01:17:39.968 --> 01:17:44.850]  In some cases, under this so-called fast track, they're not testing some of these adjuvants at all.
[01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:48.591]  It's just stuff they think will work, so hey, let's put it in there and see what happens.
[01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:53.914]  And it's very dangerous because as you say, we're dealing with a lot of materials which are capable of mutation.
[01:17:54.554 --> 01:18:00.227]  And intermixing within the body and the interactions have never been tested for either with all these adjuvants they're putting together.
[01:18:00.227 --> 01:18:02.392]  This is incredibly dangerous and reckless stuff.
[01:18:03.035 --> 01:18:15.899]  Well, I've got a story up on PrisonPlanet.com that has all these links to Mayo Clinic, Mainstream Reports, where they just calmly announce, oh, this is a live vaccine and it's gonna mutate and gonna spread.
[01:18:15.899 --> 01:18:30.303]  I mean, how obvious is it, Mike, or do you agree, that they're first giving the type that'll spread to actually create the fear and actually spread it and spread sickness and spread people testing positive for the antibodies so they get panicked and get the shot?
[01:18:31.249 --> 01:18:37.953]  I think that's probably exactly what's going on here, because down the road, you know, ultimately, we are going to pay for all of this stuff.
[01:18:37.953 --> 01:18:45.197]  It's always taxpayer-funded, or it comes out of some other way, or there may be somewhere down the road where there's a new vaccine that we have to pay for privately.
[01:18:45.197 --> 01:18:50.620]  It's all about sucking the last of the money out of the American people under any pretext whatsoever.
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.602]  Swine flu, global warming, health insurance, whatever.
[01:18:53.602 --> 01:18:58.485]  They're grabbing the last few nickels out of our pockets before they ski-daddle for the border.
[01:18:58.485 --> 01:19:00.206]  Well, that was my next point.
[01:19:01.522 --> 01:19:06.671]  You would think with the media losing credibility, losing ratings, getting discredited, they would start being more credible.
[01:19:06.671 --> 01:19:14.403]  Instead, it seems like the lying has gone tenfold, wall-to-wall, as if they're in panic mode.
[01:19:15.231 --> 01:19:38.327]  I agree absolutely and nothing I think shows that more than the last two weeks we're following on the Goldstone Report about Israel and then the UN requesting Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to inspections and Israel says no then Iran turns around and informs the IAEA they're starting to build a new facility and it shows to the entire world Iran is playing by the rules Israel is not
[01:19:38.627 --> 01:19:40.188]  And so what does the American media do?
[01:19:40.188 --> 01:19:54.640]  They crank up this non-stop rock and roll full tilt boogie propaganda campaign to resell the idea that Iran are the bad guys and the US and Israel are the really good guys and we should not pay attention to the fact that Iran is playing by the rules because they're only doing it to throw us off.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:59.504]  Mike, let's talk about Iran, Afghanistan next, then get into the death of the dollar.
[01:19:59.504 --> 01:19:59.905]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.141 --> 01:20:12.055]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[01:20:12.055 --> 01:20:16.241]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[01:20:16.241 --> 01:20:17.983]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:18.363 --> 01:20:24.005]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:24.005 --> 01:20:34.029]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:40.512]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:20:40.512 --> 01:20:43.833]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:45.934]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:20:45.934 --> 01:20:47.795]  It simply needs some help so it has
[01:20:48.195 --> 01:20:48.937]  I think so.
[01:21:01.235 --> 01:21:07.059]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.059 --> 01:21:14.624]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:21:14.624 --> 01:21:20.789]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:23.191]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:25.693]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:25.693 --> 01:21:37.264]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:21:37.264 --> 01:21:38.945]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:38.945 --> 01:21:40.807]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:40.807 --> 01:21:47.033]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:55.974 --> 01:21:57.536]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.536 --> 01:21:58.738]  The people strike back!
[01:22:00.643 --> 01:22:02.344]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:02.344 --> 01:22:02.744]  October 6, 2009.
[01:22:02.744 --> 01:22:03.645]  Gold opened this morning at $10.29.70.
[01:22:03.645 --> 01:22:06.846]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $10.58.45, $5.29.23 for the half ounce, or $2.64.61 for a quarter ounce.
[01:22:06.846 --> 01:22:07.307]  That's $10.58.45, $5.29.23, or $2.64.61.
[01:22:19.452 --> 01:22:30.184]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:22:30.184 --> 01:22:33.487]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:22:33.487 --> 01:22:36.951]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:39.794]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:22:39.994 --> 01:22:42.837]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.

[01:24:06.134 --> 01:24:15.658]  We're going to be getting into the drumbeat to abolish the dollar and replace it with something even worse.
[01:24:17.537 --> 01:24:23.320]  What that's going to mean to this nation is not pretty.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.242]  This is much worse than any foreign military power could do to us.
[01:24:26.242 --> 01:24:33.706]  We're going to get more into the flu, going to get into what's happening with these fusion centers, open announcing
[01:24:35.037 --> 01:24:39.080]  Open announcement by the President of the Federalization of Society, but going back to Mike Rivero.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:43.042]  Mike, you got cut off by the break getting into Iran.
[01:24:43.042 --> 01:24:44.363]  I had Ray McGovern on last week.
[01:24:44.363 --> 01:24:47.485]  He agreed with your analysis, the comments I've had.
[01:24:47.485 --> 01:24:49.026]  It was a total hoax.
[01:24:49.026 --> 01:24:51.147]  Iran is always building these enrichment centers.
[01:24:51.147 --> 01:24:52.548]  They have a whole bunch of them.
[01:24:52.548 --> 01:24:53.609]  The site was known.
[01:24:53.609 --> 01:24:55.410]  They're getting ready to open it in a few months.
[01:24:55.410 --> 01:24:58.152]  They said, here is a site that gets enrichment up to about 85% non-weapons grade.
[01:25:00.433 --> 01:25:02.995]  We'd like you to come inspect and set up stuff here.
[01:25:02.995 --> 01:25:06.597]  And the media hoaxed it here and said, we found a secret base!
[01:25:06.597 --> 01:25:09.638]  And then the next day, oh well, they told us about it sneakily!
[01:25:09.638 --> 01:25:12.740]  I mean, that's the contempt the media has for us.
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:13.641]  It was all a big hoax.
[01:25:14.963 --> 01:25:22.547]  Well, first of all, the enrichment for fuel rods is only 5%, not 85%, and that's what Iran is basically working on.
[01:25:22.547 --> 01:25:39.436]  And the idea was, as I said, the reason for this incredible explosion of anti-Iran propaganda was to distract the rest of the world from the fact that Iran was playing by the rules of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it is a signer, and it was playing by the rules set down by the International Atomic Energy Agency,
[01:25:39.896 --> 01:25:47.820]  And only the week before the United Nations had asked Israel to sign the NNPT and submit to inspections and Israel said absolutely not.
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:55.104]  Last spring the United States asked Israel to sign the NNPT and submit to inspections and Israel said no.
[01:25:55.104 --> 01:26:01.667]  Do you remember Barack Obama's first press conference as President and Helen Thomas asked him that direct question.
[01:26:01.667 --> 01:26:05.129]  What countries in the Middle East today have nuclear weapons?
[01:26:05.129 --> 01:26:07.730]  And Barack Obama put on his tap shoes and he tap danced away.
[01:26:08.291 --> 01:26:08.891]  We're good to go.
[01:26:26.004 --> 01:26:34.468]  That has nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technology that is not a signer of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or allows IAEA inspections.
[01:26:34.468 --> 01:26:39.270]  In other words, all these billions and billions of dollars our government keeps giving to Israel is illegal!
[01:26:40.242 --> 01:26:46.083]  if Israel has nuclear weapons and so there's this sort of a secret nudge nudge wink wink understanding between the U.S.
[01:26:46.083 --> 01:26:47.403]  and Israel where the U.S.
[01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:55.685]  will always pretend not to know that Israel is a nuclear power so they can go on looting money from the taxpayers and sending it to Israel.
[01:26:55.685 --> 01:26:57.625]  Saying that Israel can't protect themselves.
[01:26:57.625 --> 01:27:01.786]  I want to continue your comment there but I want to go back to this enrichment issue.
[01:27:01.786 --> 01:27:08.167]  I'm not a nuclear engineer like Bob Bowman or somebody but I want to be clear from what I've read in the press or if you're saying this is false.
[01:27:08.167 --> 01:27:09.327]  Ninety-five percent
[01:27:10.362 --> 01:27:15.705]  Centrifugal enrichment is what they need for an A-bomb, for weapons grade.
[01:27:15.705 --> 01:27:22.368]  Now, the debate is, they've said, you don't need a high percentage for regular fuel rods.
[01:27:22.368 --> 01:27:26.850]  Why can some of your centrifuges get up to 84, 85, 86 percent?
[01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:28.931]  The point is, it still won't make a bomb.
[01:27:28.931 --> 01:27:33.513]  My point is, they do have centrifuges, I believe Iran's admitted this, up to 80-something percent.
[01:27:34.093 --> 01:27:36.173]  But the point is, it's nowhere near the 95.
[01:27:36.173 --> 01:27:43.115]  Getting that other 10% is very, very hard to do compared to what you're saying about them only needing 5% for fuel rods.
[01:27:43.115 --> 01:27:45.195]  Well, then the question is, why do they need that?
[01:27:45.195 --> 01:27:46.875]  Then the other debate comes in.
[01:27:46.875 --> 01:27:49.916]  They're many years away from a primitive A-bomb, no delivery system.
[01:27:49.916 --> 01:27:50.836]  The U.S.
[01:27:50.836 --> 01:27:55.057]  and England helped give Pakistan nukes and delivery systems.
[01:27:55.057 --> 01:27:57.257]  Israel has 400 or more nukes.
[01:27:57.257 --> 01:27:58.978]  They have high-tech delivery systems.
[01:27:58.978 --> 01:28:00.638]  Why is everybody picking on Iran?
[01:28:01.894 --> 01:28:08.320]  Well, everybody's picking on Iran because if you look through the newspapers over the last several years, Israel is the one saying, please go pick on Iran.
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:09.221]  We're afraid of Iran.
[01:28:09.221 --> 01:28:10.342]  Iran hates us.
[01:28:10.342 --> 01:28:12.645]  Ahmadinejad wants to wipe Israel off the map.
[01:28:12.645 --> 01:28:17.530]  It's the same kind of propaganda campaign we saw leading into the attack on Iraq.
[01:28:17.530 --> 01:28:18.771]  Israel says, go kill them.
[01:28:18.771 --> 01:28:19.131]  The U.S.
[01:28:19.131 --> 01:28:21.714]  government says, yes, master, I must go kill.
[01:28:21.714 --> 01:28:22.755]  And the American kids,
[01:28:23.175 --> 01:28:23.335]  I think?
[01:28:41.793 --> 01:28:42.554]  Because the U.S.
[01:28:42.554 --> 01:28:48.900]  doesn't have anything to sell, we're using our threat of war to keep other countries to go along propping up U.S.
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:49.200]  debt.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:56.808]  Now the other aspect and the reason they're pushing for yet another war in this huge mess of wars we've already got going, if you go back and you look at history,
[01:28:57.168 --> 01:28:57.609]  The U.S.
[01:28:57.609 --> 01:29:03.756]  got out of the crash of 1904 by getting into World War I. They got out of the crash of 1929 by getting into World War II.
[01:29:03.756 --> 01:29:12.346]  Now we're in the crash of 2007, and it's not a coincidence our government is trying to create a major war to distract us all from the fact that the U.S.
[01:29:12.346 --> 01:29:15.150]  government is what screwed up the economy and this country.
[01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:16.891]  And by the way, that's not your opinion.
[01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:26.480]  The RAND Corporation a year ago said we need a giant, multi-theater war on the scale of World War II to bring in the New World Order.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:32.826]  And they need that political diversion, or stage terror, or a swine flu pandemic, or all three of them combined.
[01:29:34.008 --> 01:29:36.589]  We're entering the danger zone right now.
[01:29:36.589 --> 01:29:39.810]  Mike Rivera, let's continue to talk about that on the other side.
[01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:51.234]  Then I want to get into the media saying it's the Arabs that are going to kill the dollar, when it's our own G20, our own Geithner saying they're open to moving away from the dollar.
[01:29:51.234 --> 01:29:52.634]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.634 --> 01:29:54.235]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.235 --> 01:29:57.876]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.087 --> 01:30:04.090]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:09.415]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.415 --> 01:30:11.476]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.476 --> 01:30:16.481]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.481 --> 01:30:17.382]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.642 --> 01:30:18.763]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.763 --> 01:30:20.644]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.644 --> 01:30:21.724]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.724 --> 01:30:23.925]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.925 --> 01:30:25.266]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.266 --> 01:30:26.787]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.787 --> 01:30:32.070]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:35.652]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.652 --> 01:30:39.114]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.454 --> 01:30:40.695]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.695 --> 01:30:41.595]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.595 --> 01:30:42.695]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.695 --> 01:30:43.636]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.636 --> 01:30:44.716]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.716 --> 01:30:47.777]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.777 --> 01:30:49.538]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.538 --> 01:30:50.458]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.086 --> 01:31:05.393]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:09.919]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:09.919 --> 01:31:12.202]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.202 --> 01:31:13.824]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.824 --> 01:31:14.866]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.086 --> 01:31:23.515]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.515 --> 01:31:30.983]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:31:36.989 --> 01:31:43.015]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.015 --> 01:31:47.180]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:54.647]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.

[01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:05.944]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[01:32:05.944 --> 01:32:09.445]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[01:32:09.445 --> 01:32:15.167]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[01:32:15.167 --> 01:32:17.728]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[01:32:17.728 --> 01:32:22.269]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[01:32:22.269 --> 01:32:24.990]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:31.176]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[01:32:31.176 --> 01:32:33.418]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:33.418 --> 01:32:41.987]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[01:32:41.987 --> 01:32:42.988]  Don't pick your nose.
[01:32:43.348 --> 01:32:47.933]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[01:32:47.933 --> 01:32:53.039]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[01:32:53.039 --> 01:32:54.800]  Go to no germs dot info.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.003]  That's no germs dot info.
[01:32:57.003 --> 01:32:58.745]  Be well and stay well.
[01:32:58.745 --> 01:32:59.465]  Best MZ.
[01:33:19.402 --> 01:33:22.545]  We're good to go.
[01:33:42.719 --> 01:33:46.401]  Look, we have a corrupt elite who aren't going to turn loose.
[01:33:46.401 --> 01:33:48.221]  They're not going to stop what they're doing.
[01:33:48.221 --> 01:33:49.162]  They're not going to quit.
[01:33:49.162 --> 01:34:01.987]  And as long as we debate Barack Obama and George Bush and the new Mitt Romney, who's probably going to be the next Republican nominee, and, oh, he's a Mormon, he isn't, oh, look at Brett Favre.
[01:34:01.987 --> 01:34:04.208]  You know, he beat his old team yesterday.
[01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:07.630]  Look at, look at all the people extorting David Letterman and
[01:34:09.932 --> 01:34:12.393]  All these other people, it doesn't matter.
[01:34:12.393 --> 01:34:13.794]  It's all theater.
[01:34:13.794 --> 01:34:21.937]  Obama is continuing the exact same policies on every point of Bush, just different rhetoric.
[01:34:21.937 --> 01:34:25.339]  And things are only going to get worse and worse until we turn around and stop this.
[01:34:25.339 --> 01:34:31.902]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, I'm going to play for the world premiere of the new Fall of the Republic trailer.
[01:34:33.524 --> 01:34:38.368]  We're going to play it live here on air coming up in about 10 minutes and we're going to be taking your calls.
[01:34:38.368 --> 01:34:42.651]  Going back to Mike Rivera.
[01:34:42.651 --> 01:34:48.636]  Mike, looking at the end of the dollar, I saw the headlines in the London Telegraph today.
[01:34:48.636 --> 01:34:49.917]  The Independent also reported it.
[01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:52.259]  The demise of the dollar are the headlines.
[01:34:55.205 --> 01:35:01.330]  Says oil states are plotting, but we have the G20, we have Russia, we have China, we have the United States.
[01:35:01.330 --> 01:35:05.113]  Geithner's saying, yeah, we're going to SDRs, bank to bank.
[01:35:05.113 --> 01:35:10.037]  We'll still have our regional currencies, it's just going to be global digital transfers where the banks
[01:35:10.777 --> 01:35:19.123]  Don't just have countries back up new debts they create and that they then loan, but that now the banks will just issue debt themselves.
[01:35:19.123 --> 01:35:21.684]  They've always done that through fractional reserve banking.
[01:35:21.684 --> 01:35:26.327]  Now they're just removing the final links and then they're going to make us back up their Ponzi schemes.
[01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:29.350]  And so how do you see them killing the dollar?
[01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:35.814]  I mean, this continual drumbeat of kill the dollar, kill the dollar, kill the dollar, kill the dollar, kill the dollar.
[01:35:35.814 --> 01:35:43.039]  And then I'm seeing product placement in ads for soft drinks about keep the dollar, dump the euro.
[01:35:43.039 --> 01:35:45.020]  So there's definitely a big fight going on.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.162]  From your research, who are the players?
[01:35:47.162 --> 01:35:48.162]  I want your perspective.
[01:35:48.162 --> 01:35:49.563]  What's going on?
[01:35:49.563 --> 01:35:51.385]  What's the larger picture in all of this?
[01:35:52.266 --> 01:35:59.823]  And do you see this being a slow death of the dollar, phasing us into this new global bank, where the banks openly become the world government?
[01:36:01.198 --> 01:36:12.722]  Well it's a complex issue and first of all Saudi Arabia has already gone public saying that this story about this plot between the oil companies in Russia and the oil countries and Russia and China does not exist.
[01:36:12.722 --> 01:36:21.285]  Now that doesn't necessarily mean it's so, but the dollar took a major beating and obviously those countries still holding a lot of dollar reserves don't want that to happen.
[01:36:21.285 --> 01:36:24.566]  So there's a big deny he said she said going on.
[01:36:24.566 --> 01:36:26.586]  I tend to go with trusting Robert Fisk.
[01:36:26.586 --> 01:36:28.147]  He's got a good record for accuracy.
[01:36:28.787 --> 01:36:29.067]  I think?
[01:36:44.996 --> 01:36:45.557]  No, we're good.
[01:37:02.448 --> 01:37:07.493]  uh... compound interest over decade after decade of reckless spending by the u.s.
[01:37:07.493 --> 01:37:23.588]  government and of course the federal reserve is a private bank it's no more federal than federal express they encourage this they encourage paying only the interest and never the principal they support congressional campaigns for those candidates who will go on supporting this financial enslavement system
[01:37:24.048 --> 01:37:31.396]  And so the problem is we've reached the point where nobody trusts the dollar anymore because it has to inflate just to cover its own indebtedness.
[01:37:31.396 --> 01:37:36.120]  And this is why we're seeing other countries start to very slowly and quietly get out of their dollar positions.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.944]  Nobody wants to do something that will trigger a panic because that will hurt everybody.
[01:37:39.944 --> 01:37:47.252]  But once all the other countries are out of their dollar positions, then the rug is going to get pulled out from under it because there'll be nothing left to support it.
[01:37:47.572 --> 01:38:05.490]  In addition to this story that we had about the oil nations wanting to get out of the dollar, we're hearing all this talk about switching the reserve currency of the world away from the dollar, sort of undoing the last of the Bretton Woods Agreement, and without those two factors creating artificial international demand for the dollars, who would want them?
[01:38:05.490 --> 01:38:06.030]  The U.S.
[01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:08.853]  doesn't make anything anybody else wants to buy anymore.
[01:38:09.073 --> 01:38:11.314]  We're no longer an agricultural giant.
[01:38:11.314 --> 01:38:12.514]  We've lost our industry.
[01:38:12.514 --> 01:38:14.074]  We've lost our high-tech.
[01:38:14.074 --> 01:38:15.375]  This nation has been looted.
[01:38:15.375 --> 01:38:20.556]  There's a TV show on the History Channel just today, The Crumbling of America, showing how the U.S.
[01:38:20.556 --> 01:38:27.858]  federal government has absolutely neglected the infrastructure of this country for decades, and it's literally falling apart.
[01:38:27.858 --> 01:38:30.599]  We're dissolving into a third-world nation right before our eyes.
[01:38:32.731 --> 01:38:33.812]  And that's the plan.
[01:38:33.812 --> 01:38:55.824]  You go back to Maurice Strong, we cover this in my film Fall of the Republic, they openly wrote and stated at the United Nations Rio de Janeiro 92 meeting on population, they said we're going to destroy society, destroy industry to save the earth, we're going to create a debt system where the average person, even if they're hard-working, can't get credit or can't get enough of a job to be able to have more than one child.
[01:38:56.624 --> 01:39:04.188]  We're going to have a social welfare system that bans any type of family support, that bans neighborhoods keeping each other's kids.
[01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:06.309]  That's now happening worldwide.
[01:39:06.309 --> 01:39:09.511]  It's global implementation of the new global corporate state.
[01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:13.693]  They want us totally dependent on them so they can then social engineer us.
[01:39:13.693 --> 01:39:14.714]  They're psychopaths.
[01:39:14.714 --> 01:39:15.534]  They're control freaks.
[01:39:15.534 --> 01:39:21.638]  They want us chained down in the barn so they can get the blowtorch and pliers out.
[01:39:21.638 --> 01:39:24.980]  That's what this control freak religion is all about and
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.841]  You know, they keep explaining on the news today.
[01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:29.701]  I was watching CNBC for 20 minutes.
[01:39:29.701 --> 01:39:32.222]  They were saying, look, it's a new economy.
[01:39:32.222 --> 01:39:38.265]  We have a 10% unemployment, and this is a good economy, and there's going to be more unemployed.
[01:39:38.265 --> 01:39:41.366]  And as long as the banks are making money, our economy's doing good.
[01:39:41.366 --> 01:39:44.727]  So we now have a jobless recovery oxymoron.
[01:39:44.727 --> 01:39:46.608]  Talk about that, Mike, from your perspective.
[01:39:49.031 --> 01:40:04.441]  Yeah, basically the health of the economy is being defined solely in terms of the corporations which so far are surviving on taxpayer bailouts and we are literally in a fascist economy where the wealth is being moved from the working and middle classes to the ultra-rich
[01:40:04.781 --> 01:40:06.362]  Profits are kept private.
[01:40:06.362 --> 01:40:07.523]  Losses are socialized.
[01:40:07.523 --> 01:40:10.446]  That is the hallmark of a fascist economy.
[01:40:10.446 --> 01:40:24.397]  And the bottom line is if anybody wants to know what life is going to be like under this new corporate state, all you have to do is look back in history at the abuses of the company towns that we used to see out in the mining communities and the railroad camps and how horribly oppressive they were.
[01:40:24.397 --> 01:40:26.839]  That is exactly what is in store for all of us.
[01:40:27.119 --> 01:40:32.304]  Now, we keep hearing all this stuff about how global government is going to be good and it's going to be wonderful, means the end of war.
[01:40:32.304 --> 01:40:32.924]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:32.924 --> 01:40:35.527]  Global government is what Alexander the Great wanted.
[01:40:35.527 --> 01:40:37.349]  It was what the Roman Caesars wanted.
[01:40:37.349 --> 01:40:38.770]  It was what Napoleon wanted.
[01:40:38.770 --> 01:40:39.951]  It was what Hitler wanted.
[01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:43.034]  And it brought more war and more death and more deprivation.
[01:40:43.394 --> 01:40:48.697]  And even after they got something approaching global government, it was a disaster for everybody.
[01:40:48.697 --> 01:40:56.841]  When Alexander the Great died, he deliberately shattered his empire to create new civil wars so that nobody else would ever be his equal in history.
[01:40:56.841 --> 01:41:00.303]  That's the kind of insanity that we see in the leadership every century.
[01:41:00.683 --> 01:41:16.944]  Planet Earth is cursed with a person or a group of people who think they have a right to control it all and they want to stand up on top of a pyramid built to their own vanity and scream, I am king of the world and it doesn't matter how much poverty and disease and starvation and privation and death they bring to the rest of the world to do it.
[01:41:17.344 --> 01:41:20.187]  Yeah, it's Yertle the Turtle, in fact, going back to that.
[01:41:20.187 --> 01:41:31.377]  Big government is global tyranny, and global government is worldwide straitjacket, nowhere to run, and that's why they want global standardization, the OECD, the IMF and World Bank all brag.
[01:41:31.377 --> 01:41:39.925]  That's what world government is, is a private group of bankers running your carbon footprint, taxing, tracking everything you do, taxing energy,
[01:41:40.626 --> 01:41:55.495]  Taxing money transfers and bankrupting things and re-engineering the economy where you can only get a scholarship to be a cop or only be a scholarship to be a secret agent or only get a scholarship to data mine and surveil people.
[01:41:55.495 --> 01:42:01.639]  And so you've got all these people with degrees who rationalize what they're doing because that's their degree.
[01:42:01.639 --> 01:42:02.520]  That's who they are.
[01:42:03.570 --> 01:42:05.371]  And what they are.
[01:42:05.371 --> 01:42:09.374]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:42:09.374 --> 01:42:16.718]  And now, as they engineer the crisis, they then pose as the saviors for the next leg of the solution.
[01:42:16.718 --> 01:42:23.863]  I want to go to a video clip now for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and an audio clip for the radio listeners.
[01:42:23.863 --> 01:42:26.284]  This is going to be going up at FallTheRepublic.com.
[01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:33.892]  You want to see it in the highest quality, in members quality, in PrisonPlanet.tv members quality.
[01:42:33.892 --> 01:42:40.115]  It's in the members medium quality, because the super high quality, a lot of folks don't have connections to download or stream.
[01:42:40.115 --> 01:42:44.657]  But this is going out in the next 20-30 minutes at FallTheRepublic.com.
[01:42:44.657 --> 01:42:48.098]  But here it is, premiered on the radio.
[01:42:48.098 --> 01:42:50.339]  This is the second major trailer.
[01:42:50.339 --> 01:42:51.939]  Rob Jacobson did this one.
[01:42:51.939 --> 01:42:55.421]  Another one's coming out tomorrow on the mind control angle in the film.
[01:42:56.221 --> 01:43:12.024]  This is kind of a general trailer for Fall of the Republic that you can pre-order now and then that means it'll be shipped out in the order it's received on or before October 21st on DVD in the highest quality and of course premiering at PrisonPlanet.TV as well.
[01:43:12.024 --> 01:43:20.406]  Here is the latest trailer, trailer number two for Fall of the Republic.
[01:43:20.406 --> 01:43:24.047]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:25.222 --> 01:43:29.244]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:29.244 --> 01:43:34.046]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:43:34.046 --> 01:43:42.089]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:43:42.089 --> 01:43:47.312]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[01:43:47.312 --> 01:43:52.294]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:43:54.173 --> 01:43:58.414]  One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes.
[01:43:58.414 --> 01:44:05.336]  I have a question for this young man.
[01:44:05.336 --> 01:44:07.516]  He has the right to be represented.
[01:44:07.516 --> 01:44:18.579]  It's up to every man, woman and child in the United States to decide whether we're going to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers or whether we're going to restore the republic.
[01:44:19.741 --> 01:44:24.762]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today it seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:24.762 --> 01:44:34.504]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:34.504 --> 01:44:36.524]  Who's gonna soak up the derivatives?
[01:44:36.524 --> 01:44:38.104]  Who's gonna soak up the debt?
[01:44:38.104 --> 01:44:39.904]  Who's gonna be penalized?
[01:44:39.904 --> 01:44:48.366]  Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[01:44:50.113 --> 01:44:50.534]  I don't know.
[01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:57.459]  Do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that provision of the Constitution to hand out a half a trillion dollars to foreigners?
[01:44:57.459 --> 01:45:00.602]  Will we choose liberty or will we choose tyranny?
[01:45:00.602 --> 01:45:03.144]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[01:45:03.144 --> 01:45:06.086]  You don't have a president, you have an actor.
[01:45:06.086 --> 01:45:08.768]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:45:08.768 --> 01:45:10.670]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:13.052]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:45:13.052 --> 01:45:14.953]  Who do we sell these matches to?
[01:45:14.953 --> 01:45:19.237]  The last vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away.
[01:45:20.856 --> 01:45:23.697]  Fall of the Republic.
[01:45:23.697 --> 01:45:24.997]  Volume 1.
[01:45:24.997 --> 01:45:27.898]  The Presidency of Barack Obama.
[01:45:27.898 --> 01:45:34.779]  Available on DVD at InfoWars.com and online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:45:34.779 --> 01:45:38.820]  The destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:39.261]  October 21st, 2009.
[01:45:48.832 --> 01:46:04.940]  Okay, and that's going up at FollowTheRepublic.com right now and at PrisonPlanet.tv and of course in the next few hours at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube if you wish to watch it again or for radio listeners who aren't watching PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:46:06.262 --> 01:46:09.223]  Is this the fall of our republic, Mike Rivero?
[01:46:09.223 --> 01:46:13.625]  I mean, I think we should be honest that for all intents and purposes, they're killing the dollar.
[01:46:13.625 --> 01:46:15.605]  That kills the empire.
[01:46:15.605 --> 01:46:19.166]  The country's already broke back over funding the empire, because it's not our empire.
[01:46:19.166 --> 01:46:20.567]  It's a private banking empire.
[01:46:20.567 --> 01:46:21.567]  They're done with us now.
[01:46:21.567 --> 01:46:23.588]  They've kind of maxed out our credit card.
[01:46:23.588 --> 01:46:29.810]  And that if we don't come to grips with the fact that if we don't have the Bill of Rights and Constitution, we're just more real estate, more conquered dirt.
[01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:35.697]  And that by admitting we've seen the fall of our republic, then we can set about getting our country back.
[01:46:35.697 --> 01:46:37.280]  Or, do you disagree with that statement?
[01:46:38.303 --> 01:46:48.566]  I would say we're at the point right now where we need to start seriously thinking about what we're going to build in the wake of the United States of America, because I don't see this country being able to last much longer.
[01:46:48.566 --> 01:46:51.087]  I think, much like the USSR, the U.S.
[01:46:51.087 --> 01:46:52.387]  government is going to collapse.
[01:46:52.387 --> 01:47:04.930]  Now, into that vacuum, a lot of opportunists are going to come in trying to sell us a one-world government or some other ready-made, plug-in, ready-to-rock-and-roll government, and I think we need to be aware of that with the buckets of tar and sacks of feathers.
[01:47:04.930 --> 01:47:05.651]  No, that's already happening.
[01:47:05.651 --> 01:47:06.791]  You're absolutely right, it's already happening.
[01:47:07.785 --> 01:47:25.995]  So, you know, I think we the American people have got to start sitting down and say, OK, if we're going to have a chance to create a whole new country, it is up to us to decide what it's going to be and to make sure that it's taking care of we the people and not just another group of rich opportunists coming in and treating the American people like we're just a bunch of herd animals.
[01:47:25.995 --> 01:47:35.901]  Now, I don't know if you're seeing these LRADs and these microwave pain guns they're starting to give out to the police forces, but frankly, that's just the modern equivalent of flogging the slaves back to the slave pens.
[01:47:36.161 --> 01:47:38.323]  Exactly, Mike, I wanted to ask you about that.
[01:47:38.323 --> 01:47:52.577]  These federal fusion centers going in even in small counties, Obama now admits that's for the patriots, the gun owners, the libertarians, the leftists, anybody that doesn't go along with mainline, drink your fluoride, inject your kids, worship global government.
[01:47:53.337 --> 01:48:01.746]  Uh, for anybody that's got two brain cells rubbed together, they're now deploying LRADs through Homeland Security, saying that's what NORTHCOM's for!
[01:48:01.746 --> 01:48:09.194]  They're admitting this is a giant black ski mask, no protest allowed in D.C., no protest allowed in G20.
[01:48:09.194 --> 01:48:11.496]  I mean, this is, this is Communist China!
[01:48:11.496 --> 01:48:13.679]  I mean, this is hellishly illegal!
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:17.563]  They're declaring war on the American people.
[01:48:17.563 --> 01:48:19.966]  We are now at war with our own government.
[01:48:19.966 --> 01:48:29.477]  The government has started the war and I want to be very careful about this because I don't support and encourage violence because the first side that starts shooting will be seen as the bad guys in the world opinion.
[01:48:29.477 --> 01:48:30.418]  And that's why they're losing!
[01:48:30.458 --> 01:48:37.840]  Because they're beating old women, they're having police dogs attack them, they're being caught provocateuring to make it look like we're throwing stuff first.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.981]  You're absolutely right.
[01:48:39.981 --> 01:48:40.881]  Mike, do you agree with me?
[01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:46.043]  They're losing the PR battle big time, but they're so arrogant, their humorous is carrying them through?
[01:48:46.903 --> 01:48:48.264]  That's exactly right.
[01:48:48.264 --> 01:48:51.907]  What we're dealing with here is Rivero's Law of Mid-Management.
[01:48:51.907 --> 01:48:59.112]  We have got all these super elites, most of whom are Cold War fossils who grew up in an age where the government could say and do anything and get away with it.
[01:48:59.112 --> 01:49:03.174]  And they're sitting on top of all these mid-level bureaucrats who want to keep their jobs.
[01:49:03.174 --> 01:49:06.357]  And so these mid-level bureaucrats are saying, oh yes, it's all working.
[01:49:06.357 --> 01:49:07.217]  They believe you.
[01:49:07.217 --> 01:49:09.039]  They still love the political leadership.
[01:49:09.039 --> 01:49:10.580]  They're ready to go to war.
[01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:11.760]  They're ready to die for Israel.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.822]  And they're ready to give you more of their money and their children.
[01:49:14.362 --> 01:49:15.844]  Well, that always happens.
[01:49:15.844 --> 01:49:16.184]  With Hitler,
[01:49:35.367 --> 01:49:43.312]  Up until the day before he blew his head off in the bunker, if you believe that official story, the point is, they really thought they were going to win the war up until 24 hours before.
[01:49:43.312 --> 01:49:45.033]  They were delusional.
[01:49:45.033 --> 01:49:47.095]  And I see this more and more.
[01:49:47.095 --> 01:49:48.275]  I mean, the worm has turned.
[01:49:48.275 --> 01:49:49.496]  I know we're going to win.
[01:49:49.496 --> 01:49:55.140]  It's just going to be hellish and bloody and painful, and I would rather not go that route.
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:59.463]  But power corrupts, and the establishment just thinks they're invincible, and you're right.
[01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:04.135]  That history shows that they're just repeating the same thing.
[01:50:04.135 --> 01:50:05.938]  So how do you see this shaking out, Mike?
[01:50:07.077 --> 01:50:08.958]  I am absolutely convinced that the U.S.
[01:50:08.958 --> 01:50:11.680]  government is going to collapse in the manner of the U.S.S.R.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.602]  and we need to study what the Russians did that worked and what the Russians did that did not work.
[01:50:16.602 --> 01:50:18.283]  We need to avoid their mistakes.
[01:50:18.283 --> 01:50:24.006]  We need to go through our own equivalent of kicking out the oligarchs and putting our nation back on a solid financial track.
[01:50:24.006 --> 01:50:32.471]  I mean, look how quickly Putin managed to pay off Russia's debt once they had a working economy that wasn't burdened with centuries of reckless debt and private banking interests.
[01:50:32.471 --> 01:50:33.252]  And let's get this straight.
[01:50:33.252 --> 01:50:33.772]  He's not perfect.
[01:50:33.772 --> 01:50:34.652]  I mean, we're certainly not.
[01:50:34.652 --> 01:50:34.692]  No.
[01:50:36.514 --> 01:50:37.054]  Exactly.
[01:50:37.054 --> 01:50:41.618]  If we debate liberal-conservative, nothing's ever going to... You must kick the bankers out.
[01:50:41.618 --> 01:50:42.860]  You must arrest them.
[01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:43.840]  They're the real government.
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:45.542]  You must end the Fed.
[01:50:45.542 --> 01:50:47.804]  Anything else is cosmetic and that's... Stay there, Mike.
[01:50:47.804 --> 01:50:49.506]  I want to get your take on that when we get back.
[01:50:49.506 --> 01:50:51.247]  Two more seconds with Mike Rivero.
[01:50:51.247 --> 01:50:52.569]  Jamming a few of your phone calls.
[01:50:52.569 --> 01:50:56.372]  We got the Camp FEMA folks coming out with big developments on that front.
[01:50:56.372 --> 01:50:56.853]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.152 --> 01:51:07.854]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:51:07.854 --> 01:51:09.535]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:51:09.535 --> 01:51:14.116]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:51:14.116 --> 01:51:21.779]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:51:21.779 --> 01:51:24.260]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:25.061]  I don't know.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:43.061]  That's right.
[01:52:01.303 --> 01:52:03.184]  I have everybody's attention please.
[01:52:03.184 --> 01:52:05.605]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:52:05.605 --> 01:52:08.186]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:52:08.186 --> 01:52:09.447]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:09.447 --> 01:52:11.128]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:11.128 --> 01:52:14.009]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:14.009 --> 01:52:17.651]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:27.299 --> 01:52:33.464]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:33.464 --> 01:52:34.565]  An inside job.
[01:52:35.974 --> 01:52:37.435]  How dare you?
[01:52:37.435 --> 01:52:43.479]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:43.479 --> 01:52:46.181]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:46.181 --> 01:52:52.585]  And if the government has not told the truth, in 5 years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:53:49.073 --> 01:53:50.314]  Day after day Alone on a hill
[01:54:11.375 --> 01:54:22.446]  Mike, I want to take some calls in the couple of segments we've got left with you.
[01:54:22.446 --> 01:54:25.749]  But just briefly going back to the flu.
[01:54:29.441 --> 01:54:30.542]  I mean, we know it's a fraud.
[01:54:30.542 --> 01:54:31.582]  We know it's a moneymaker.
[01:54:31.582 --> 01:54:34.524]  We know the UN's using it as a way to test global government.
[01:54:34.524 --> 01:54:44.410]  They bragged and said that the whole world under UN command on the flu response to the level six that they issue when it's not even really a level six with the number of cases or deaths.
[01:54:45.692 --> 01:54:47.792]  What do you think the overall motive?
[01:54:47.792 --> 01:54:50.253]  Was it just profit and power grab?
[01:54:50.253 --> 01:54:56.674]  Or do you think, in your spidey sense, they're planning to really go wild with this and really release something more deadly?
[01:54:56.674 --> 01:55:00.355]  Or do they know the nasal spray live virus is going to mutate?
[01:55:00.355 --> 01:55:03.856]  They say they know it is, but do they know it's going to mutate into something really bad?
[01:55:03.856 --> 01:55:07.076]  I mean, there are a bunch of eugenicists that say they want to kill us.
[01:55:07.076 --> 01:55:08.737]  Could this be their global crisis?
[01:55:08.737 --> 01:55:09.797]  100 million people dead?
[01:55:10.987 --> 01:55:16.412]  Well, I think they're definitely trying to create a global crisis in order to justify the bringing on of global government.
[01:55:16.412 --> 01:55:20.036]  They wanted to do that with global warming, human-caused global warming.
[01:55:20.036 --> 01:55:25.001]  The idea being that if there was a global environmental crisis, it had to have a global controlling authority.
[01:55:25.001 --> 01:55:34.911]  That one fell flat on its face because the Earth is actually getting cooler and the scientific underpinnings of human-caused global warming have basically all been destroyed over the last couple of years.
[01:55:35.371 --> 01:55:37.533]  So, okay, global warming isn't going to work.
[01:55:37.533 --> 01:55:39.315]  Let's come up with a new crisis.
[01:55:39.315 --> 01:55:41.237]  It's the Hegelian dialectic all over again.
[01:55:41.237 --> 01:55:49.465]  They're looking to create a global crisis of some kind that will justify, or at least sell to the people of the world, the necessity for a global government.
[01:55:49.465 --> 01:55:58.353]  Whether it's a global economic crash, a global flu pandemic, global warming, aliens invading, whatever they think is going to work, that's what they're going to do.
[01:55:58.353 --> 01:55:59.474]  By the way, that's the classic
[01:55:59.554 --> 01:56:02.376]  I'm sure you saw from the UN is carbon dioxide is going to make the ocean turn into acid.
[01:56:02.376 --> 01:56:02.456]  Yes.
[01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:29.395]  Well, technically it's already acid because it's carbonic acid, which is the same thing you have in mineral water.
[01:56:29.395 --> 01:56:36.121]  And so, again, they're taking a minor scientific truth and they're blowing it up to be this big scary threat.
[01:56:36.121 --> 01:56:41.666]  But the bottom line is that the Earth is always changing, the climate is always changing, the chemistry is always changing.
[01:56:41.666 --> 01:56:43.748]  It never stays the same.
[01:56:43.748 --> 01:56:49.413]  This idea that if there's a global government that we will lock the Earth in this particular configuration
[01:56:49.813 --> 01:56:53.921]  That's some arbitrary definition of what is ideal is absolutely nonsense.
[01:56:53.921 --> 01:56:54.663]  It is artificial.
[01:56:54.663 --> 01:56:55.124]  Exactly.
[01:56:55.124 --> 01:56:56.807]  Let me throw this at you.
[01:56:56.807 --> 01:57:00.895]  I watch on HBO Bill Maher's show sometimes because they air it all the time.
[01:57:02.097 --> 01:57:04.478]  Every show he shows the wildfires in L.A.
[01:57:04.478 --> 01:57:08.980]  and says this is global warming when they've always had wildfires in L.A.
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:20.525]  and now I've talked to the police out there and it's on their news crazy arsonists go and set fires everywhere and they have overbuilt out there and you've got people setting fires
[01:57:21.584 --> 01:57:25.629]  And then he showed a dust storm in Australia and said it was the end of the world.
[01:57:25.629 --> 01:57:29.915]  They've always had dust storms out of the interior of Australia.
[01:57:29.915 --> 01:57:34.742]  I mean, these guys will take a tornado, a tsunami, an earthquake.
[01:57:34.742 --> 01:57:36.063]  They're worse than Pat Robertson.
[01:57:36.564 --> 01:57:37.145]  You know what I mean?
[01:57:53.681 --> 01:57:54.021]  I don't know.
[01:58:18.609 --> 01:58:22.452]  Well, you know, the thing is, I know 300 Earths will fit in Jupiter.
[01:58:22.452 --> 01:58:24.013]  Google the term.
[01:58:24.013 --> 01:58:25.674]  How many Earths will fit in the Sun?
[01:58:25.674 --> 01:58:27.455]  You've got this giant fireball.
[01:58:27.455 --> 01:58:29.216]  I think it's several thousand.
[01:58:29.216 --> 01:58:33.920]  You've got this giant fireball that burns your skin if you're out in it too much.
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:39.083]  And they're saying, oh, that has nothing to do, the UN officially says, nothing to do with the climate.
[01:58:39.083 --> 01:58:42.386]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:42.386 --> 01:58:45.928]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.928 --> 01:58:47.810]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.725 --> 01:58:54.966]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.966 --> 01:58:56.966]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.966 --> 01:59:05.488]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.488 --> 01:59:11.050]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:12.670]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:19.414]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.414 --> 01:59:30.482]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.482 --> 01:59:31.242]  That's right.
[01:59:31.242 --> 01:59:33.824]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.824 --> 01:59:35.425]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:59:35.425 --> 01:59:35.625]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:59:43.050 --> 01:59:46.872]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.872 --> 01:59:49.073]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:49.073 --> 01:59:49.493]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.684 --> 02:00:08.445]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.445 --> 02:00:10.206]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.206 --> 02:00:11.787]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.787 --> 02:00:12.708]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.708 --> 02:00:17.531]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.531 --> 02:00:23.075]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.075 --> 02:00:26.477]  I know you can fit 3,000 Earths in Jupiter, so we looked up the number.
[02:00:26.477 --> 02:00:28.318]  It's 1,206,885 Earths will fit inside the Sun.
[02:00:28.318 --> 02:00:28.558]  Gigantic!
[02:00:37.546 --> 02:00:40.348]  Hydrogen Thermal Nuclear Explosion Fireball.
[02:00:40.348 --> 02:00:47.153]  It shoots off sunspot eruptions thousands of times the size of the Earth every day.
[02:00:47.153 --> 02:00:53.398]  If you're out there and just the radiation of a solar fail hits you, it'll fry you in your space suit deader than a hammer.
[02:00:53.398 --> 02:01:00.864]  And they get on the news, and I've got it in the official UN documents, and they say the sun has nothing to do with the climate.
[02:01:02.625 --> 02:01:08.374]  And they also tell you polar bears can't swim and show them out on ice flows where they hunt for seals.
[02:01:08.374 --> 02:01:11.199]  Folks, they treat you like you're a complete moron, okay?
[02:01:12.776 --> 02:01:16.797]  There's nothing we can do to affect climate change like the sun.
[02:01:16.797 --> 02:01:22.619]  Carbon dioxide... Mike, have you been seeing the ads on TV saying, watch out, carbon dioxide's deadly poison?
[02:01:22.619 --> 02:01:25.099]  I mean, how dumb do they think the public is?
[02:01:25.099 --> 02:01:33.682]  Well, they apparently think the public are very, very dumb, and the bottom line is that right now the sun is showing hardly any sunspots at all, which means it's actually cooler than normal.
[02:01:34.142 --> 02:01:55.328]  And one thing that we have discovered from all these spacecraft that we've sent to other planets, like we sent Viking to Mars back in 1976, and we've had all these spacecraft out there, and we have documented many, many times that the other planets are heating up and cooling down exactly the same time as Earth is, in the same amounts, and it's obviously the only common factor is the solar radiation here.
[02:01:55.888 --> 02:02:04.695]  Now we already know that when Al Gore did his famous little graph showing Earth's temperature related to carbon dioxide, that he actually got them backward.
[02:02:04.695 --> 02:02:09.398]  That the Earth's temperature went up first, then there was more carbon dioxide.
[02:02:09.398 --> 02:02:14.462]  Because warmer water was giving up its carbon dioxide for the same reason that warm soda pop does.
[02:02:14.462 --> 02:02:16.844]  And as the Earth got warmer, there was more life.
[02:02:16.844 --> 02:02:18.965]  Life produced more carbon dioxide.
[02:02:18.965 --> 02:02:23.089]  So the linkage is actually the reverse of what Al Gore... Now let me stop you for people that don't know.
[02:02:23.857 --> 02:02:40.344]  He knowingly, because all the ice cores, all the climatologists, it's on record that carbon dioxide, because H2O is part CO2, when the earth heats up, then more carbon dioxide comes out, then that accelerates plant life, more oxygen, that's a blooming for the earth.
[02:02:40.344 --> 02:02:43.126]  It's very hard on the earth when it's cold for overall biomass.
[02:02:43.886 --> 02:02:48.491]  They knew all of that and just lied about it.
[02:02:48.491 --> 02:02:55.198]  And just like you leave a Coca-Cola in a can in your hot car, it's going to explode because the CO2 rises in the heat.
[02:02:55.198 --> 02:02:56.159]  Al Gore knows that.
[02:02:56.159 --> 02:02:57.721]  He didn't invent the internet.
[02:02:57.721 --> 02:02:59.883]  He told you NAFTA and GATT were going to be great.
[02:02:59.883 --> 02:03:00.744]  They weren't, were they, Mike?
[02:03:01.485 --> 02:03:03.287]  No, they absolutely weren't.
[02:03:03.287 --> 02:03:14.476]  And just to show you how much, the reason why I think this global warming hype was linked to the push for a global government is look, they gave him the Nobel Peace Prize, they gave him all these film awards to say what a wonderful documentary it was.
[02:03:14.476 --> 02:03:27.867]  It's a hard sell, hard sell, hard sell to sell you the lie that you are to blame for the reason the planet is getting worse and therefore you must submit to global control and global taxation in order to atone for your sins.
[02:03:28.427 --> 02:03:30.189]  That's what the agenda was there.
[02:03:30.189 --> 02:03:36.878]  And since that's not working out and people aren't falling for the global warming anymore, they're switching over to the swine flu and global financial crisis.
[02:03:36.878 --> 02:03:41.544]  The goal is a global government and they're going to use any excuse they can come up with.
[02:03:42.475 --> 02:03:56.306]  But how can they say, if the sun is obviously the source of most heat on this planet, there's some that comes out of the tectonic plates, the thermal, from the volcanic activity in the core of the earth, up into the mammal and the crust.
[02:03:56.306 --> 02:04:00.750]  But I mean, it's just so asinine to say polar bears can't swim and the sun isn't heating us.
[02:04:00.750 --> 02:04:09.778]  I mean, it's like when I had Rothschild on, I said, the big head environmental land grabber, and I said, but Jupiter and Saturn's moons are melting,
[02:04:11.698 --> 02:04:13.779]  The ice caps of Mars are melting.
[02:04:13.779 --> 02:04:14.859]  This was three years ago.
[02:04:14.859 --> 02:04:16.100]  Now they're getting bigger.
[02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:20.322]  And he just said, well, that's because Jupiter, Saturn and Mars are closer to the Sun than the Earth.
[02:04:20.322 --> 02:04:23.203]  And I said, no, it's Mercury and then Venus and then Earth.
[02:04:23.203 --> 02:04:25.644]  He said, no, no, they're closer.
[02:04:25.644 --> 02:04:31.426]  And he just laughed because he knows the he thinks the general audience is like my audience is like the general public.
[02:04:31.426 --> 02:04:36.088]  He thought if he just acted confident and said that Saturn was the closest to the Sun, people believe it.
[02:04:37.691 --> 02:04:46.278]  Well, like I said, these guys grew up in the height of the Cold War where they could lie to the public with impunity and there was no blogosphere or alternative radio to challenge them.
[02:04:48.089 --> 02:04:49.750]  Mike, let me talk to you here in the break.
[02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:51.752]  We've got the Camp FEMA folks coming up.
[02:04:51.752 --> 02:04:53.213]  Mike Rivera, WhatWillHeppen.com.
[02:04:53.213 --> 02:04:57.076]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:57.076 --> 02:04:59.618]  The new film is pre-sale right now.
[02:04:59.618 --> 02:05:00.659]  Ships out on or before the 21st.
[02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:03.941]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.941 --> 02:05:07.564]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.564 --> 02:05:12.148]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.148 --> 02:05:13.549]  These emergency backup systems
[02:05:13.789 --> 02:05:16.671]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:16.671 --> 02:05:22.796]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.796 --> 02:05:26.418]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.418 --> 02:05:31.222]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.222 --> 02:05:37.786]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.786 --> 02:05:39.748]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.228 --> 02:05:43.432]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:06:00.771 --> 02:06:08.537]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.537 --> 02:06:14.622]  You can buy it at hereiswhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:06:14.622 --> 02:06:17.564]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.564 --> 02:06:23.469]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:23.829 --> 02:06:25.410]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:06:25.410 --> 02:06:27.911]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:27.911 --> 02:06:33.534]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.534 --> 02:06:35.615]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.615 --> 02:06:37.376]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.376 --> 02:06:39.897]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.897 --> 02:06:44.620]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:48.321]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.321 --> 02:06:50.483]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:06:51.444 --> 02:06:53.333]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.333 --> 02:06:55.483]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:01.069 --> 02:07:04.090]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.090 --> 02:07:09.413]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.413 --> 02:07:11.474]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.474 --> 02:07:16.456]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.456 --> 02:07:17.637]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.637 --> 02:07:18.777]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.777 --> 02:07:20.658]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.658 --> 02:07:21.739]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.739 --> 02:07:23.940]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:25.280]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:26.581]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.781 --> 02:07:32.046]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.046 --> 02:07:35.650]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.650 --> 02:07:39.474]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.474 --> 02:07:40.695]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.695 --> 02:07:41.596]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.596 --> 02:07:42.697]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.697 --> 02:07:43.638]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.638 --> 02:07:44.459]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.719 --> 02:07:47.761]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.761 --> 02:07:50.002]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:50.002 --> 02:07:51.002]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:51.002 --> 02:07:51.282]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.049 --> 02:08:08.811]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:08.811 --> 02:08:10.572]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.572 --> 02:08:12.153]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.153 --> 02:08:13.715]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.715 --> 02:08:17.898]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.898 --> 02:08:30.488]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.488 --> 02:08:32.950]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:35.953]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:08:37.711 --> 02:08:51.038]  Coming up, for the balance of the hour into the next hour, it's the next segment, we're going to have the makers of Camp FEMA on and talk about a host of issues, get into the flu, get into big developments with the Hardin, Montana, American police force situation.
[02:08:51.038 --> 02:08:54.620]  I haven't gotten to that yet, biggest developments yet in that case.
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:57.521]  But I wanted to hold Mike over to take some calls.
[02:08:57.521 --> 02:09:01.403]  Jasper in Mass, you're on the air, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[02:09:01.403 --> 02:09:03.004]  Hey Alex, can you hear me okay?
[02:09:03.004 --> 02:09:03.324]  Yes sir.
[02:09:06.038 --> 02:09:10.183]  Listen, I think I've got breaking news that you'd be really interested in.
[02:09:10.183 --> 02:09:21.657]  We were looking on YouTube this morning and we found these clips that talk about NASA sending a bomb to the moon.
[02:09:21.657 --> 02:09:22.337]  Have you heard about that?
[02:09:22.337 --> 02:09:23.459]  Yeah, that's public.
[02:09:23.459 --> 02:09:24.600]  That's Reuters AP.
[02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:50.929]  Since the Indian probe a few months ago found water all over the entire contiguous surface, even above the surface, in the dust, below the surface in large amounts, NASA's quickest thing they can do is to slam, they're calling it a bomb in the headlines, slam a satellite into it to then have spectrometers from a distance scan the water content because they want to find out the concentrations below ground.
[02:09:50.929 --> 02:09:52.210]  And so yes, it's very interesting.
[02:09:52.210 --> 02:09:52.931]  That's in my stack.
[02:09:54.351 --> 02:09:55.752]  Could this be the false flag?
[02:09:55.752 --> 02:10:06.161]  Because remember, um, well first of all, I wanted to point out that the date is essentially 1-9-9, which, uh, you know, is pretty close to 9-1-1.
[02:10:06.161 --> 02:10:14.347]  And, um, it's, uh, it's illegal to be doing any kind of weaponization stuff in space, I thought.
[02:10:14.347 --> 02:10:16.929]  I thought there was a ban on that.
[02:10:16.929 --> 02:10:22.974]  And then, um, additionally, could this be the false flag event that they
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:25.542]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:10:25.542 --> 02:10:27.545]  You know, I don't get into speculation here.
[02:10:39.895 --> 02:10:47.242]  We know it's a live virus they pump into the nasal cavity with the new flu vaccine and that it can mutate and spread the disease.
[02:10:47.242 --> 02:10:48.563]  We're covering it.
[02:10:48.563 --> 02:10:56.811]  We know a convicted felon fraud moved in and tried to take over a detention facility where they were talking about keeping terror suspects.
[02:10:56.811 --> 02:11:04.419]  We know that $23.7 trillion has been stolen from the people of this country in the last year.
[02:11:06.365 --> 02:11:08.489]  We know all this is happening.
[02:11:08.489 --> 02:11:12.417]  It's the wrong show and I don't bash people that get off into different things.
[02:11:12.417 --> 02:11:15.764]  You know, I even knew about the water on the moon through Buzz Aldrin.
[02:11:16.510 --> 02:11:22.337]  through Charlie Sheen before it was even in the news and I didn't even mention that because it would just sound weird.
[02:11:22.337 --> 02:11:25.981]  Oh Buzz Aldrin says they're going to announce the next month they found water on it.
[02:11:25.981 --> 02:11:28.664]  I told my wife about it, a few people around the office.
[02:11:28.664 --> 02:11:31.107]  I got some text messages from Charlie about it.
[02:11:31.107 --> 02:11:36.733]  But the point is, is that I just don't get off into all that.
[02:11:36.733 --> 02:11:37.354]  Mike Rivera
[02:11:38.755 --> 02:11:48.258]  Well, I mean, this is not weaponization, this is a repeat of what they did with the comet impactor mission, and it's becoming a standardized technique.
[02:11:48.258 --> 02:11:58.482]  You throw a large object into the celestial body you're investigating, and as you said correctly, you use a spectroscope on the debris to see what came out of the center.
[02:11:58.482 --> 02:12:03.124]  And this is a precursor to a possible permanent lunar base at the moon's south pole,
[02:12:03.484 --> 02:12:10.789]  Where if there is a source of water there underneath the regolith, it's going to make the logistics of supporting such a base that much easier.
[02:12:10.789 --> 02:12:16.853]  It's not a false flag, it's not weaponization, it's just the next step in establishing a permanent lunar colony.
[02:12:18.869 --> 02:12:20.070]  Absolutely.
[02:12:20.070 --> 02:12:20.811]  False flag.
[02:12:20.811 --> 02:12:31.881]  I mean, having a satellite, little satellite, not that big of a satellite, slam in as a meteor gun into the surface of the moon so they can register how much water vapor comes up.
[02:12:31.881 --> 02:12:33.883]  I mean, that's not a false flag.
[02:12:33.883 --> 02:12:37.246]  But I'm not trying to make enemies with listeners disagreeing with you.
[02:12:37.246 --> 02:12:38.207]  I just, you know,
[02:12:39.321 --> 02:12:52.450]  I got so much stuff here I can prove that's off the charts insane, and nobody seems to care that the White House Science Czar has written more than 10 textbooks calling for the extermination of the majority of the public and forced drugging of the water supply to sterilize us.
[02:12:52.450 --> 02:12:59.435]  But I can get plenty of people to call in and tell me about reptoids, and I'm not bashing the people that think everybody's a reptoid.
[02:12:59.435 --> 02:13:00.996]  The point is, is that isn't me.
[02:13:00.996 --> 02:13:02.317]  I'm not into that.
[02:13:02.317 --> 02:13:04.298]  I'm just into what I can prove.
[02:13:04.298 --> 02:13:06.219]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Maryland.
[02:13:06.219 --> 02:13:06.860]  You're on the air.
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:07.220]  Go ahead.
[02:13:09.025 --> 02:13:10.266]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:13:10.266 --> 02:13:11.727]  Good, buddy.
[02:13:11.727 --> 02:13:17.410]  Hey, I used to work for a wholesale store, and it's called Costco.
[02:13:17.410 --> 02:13:31.099]  Talking about the North American Union, and the meat boxes, and the meat labels, and the meat wrapper labels, they said a product of U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
[02:13:31.099 --> 02:13:34.802]  And sometimes they'll say Canada and Mexico, and
[02:13:37.108 --> 02:13:44.232]  And some, like you know, sometimes they'll say, a product of North America.
[02:13:44.232 --> 02:14:02.243]  Well, I mean, I remember two years ago, I got the letter, because I have employees in Texas, from the Texas Workforce Commission, saying, you will no longer report your employee data, and workers comp, all that kind of stuff, to the Bureau of National Statistics, to the Labor Department, through us.
[02:14:02.243 --> 02:14:04.264]  You will report it to the North American Union.
[02:14:05.191 --> 02:14:07.572]  And it gave me my North American Union ID number.
[02:14:07.572 --> 02:14:13.413]  And then... It's one of those things where it happens so close to home, I didn't even cover it for a few weeks.
[02:14:13.413 --> 02:14:15.814]  I didn't... It was so weird.
[02:14:15.814 --> 02:14:17.174]  My wife just pointed it out.
[02:14:17.174 --> 02:14:21.435]  And then, Jerome Corsi at Human Events and WorldNetDaily did report on it.
[02:14:21.435 --> 02:14:22.675]  Separately, people noticed.
[02:14:22.675 --> 02:14:24.996]  So, Mike Rivero comments on that.
[02:14:24.996 --> 02:14:26.816]  I mean, that's all this is, is being conquered.
[02:14:26.816 --> 02:14:34.478]  You have private banks come in, they announce new government agencies, they rewrite the laws in a tyrannical way, so they control everything, and that's it.
[02:14:35.728 --> 02:14:46.237]  Yeah, basically that's it and that's the reason the first two United States central banks were shut down by courageous presidents who had more gonadal tissue than our current administration.
[02:14:46.237 --> 02:14:53.084]  And every time there has been a central bank privately owned, it has brought hardship and impoverishment to the American people.
[02:14:53.764 --> 02:14:57.886]  Uh, you know, when Ben Franklin was serving as ambassador to the court of St.
[02:14:57.886 --> 02:15:01.568]  James for the colonies, and they said, what do you do with all your poor and unemployed?
[02:15:01.568 --> 02:15:02.969]  And he said, we don't have poor and unemployed.
[02:15:02.969 --> 02:15:07.231]  There's enough money around for everybody to have jobs and be carrying on their commerce.
[02:15:07.231 --> 02:15:12.354]  And immediately the Bank of England went to King George III and lobbied him to pass a currency act saying,
[02:15:12.614 --> 02:15:16.377]  That the colonies had to conform to the banking practices of the Bank of England.
[02:15:16.377 --> 02:15:22.703]  Two years later, there was massive poverty, massive unemployment, and that was where the anger for the American Revolution really came from.
[02:15:22.703 --> 02:15:26.045]  Forget about the Stamp Act and the T-Tax and all the rest of it.
[02:15:26.045 --> 02:15:30.850]  It was that deliberate impoverishment by a private bank that fueled the first American Revolution.
[02:15:30.850 --> 02:15:32.291]  And I think it might fuel the second.
[02:15:34.175 --> 02:15:36.636]  Well, you're absolutely right, Mike Rivero.
[02:15:36.636 --> 02:15:39.797]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:15:39.797 --> 02:15:43.938]  I guess Kenny in Texas is up next, or is it Matthew?
[02:15:43.938 --> 02:15:45.419]  Kenny, welcome.
[02:15:45.419 --> 02:15:46.259]  How you doing?
[02:15:46.259 --> 02:15:48.720]  I'm a big fan, Alex.
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:54.401]  I just wanted to call because I kind of had an event the other day, and I just wanted to let you know about it.
[02:15:54.401 --> 02:16:02.604]  I stumbled into a volunteer firefighter, and he's FEMA certified through a bunch of different things.
[02:16:03.734 --> 02:16:10.587]  And, uh, he has been practicing with the Galveston County Office of Emergency Management.
[02:16:10.587 --> 02:16:14.615]  And, uh, he showed me one of these bracelets that y'all were talking about.
[02:16:15.518 --> 02:16:17.980]  Are these bracelets with this RFID?
[02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:19.802]  Yeah, we weren't doing that.
[02:16:19.802 --> 02:16:27.068]  It was a medical person with the Army saying they're training with the CHIPS in California, the Highway Patrol, to do this.
[02:16:27.068 --> 02:16:30.931]  And then we confirmed in the UN documents they are preparing that.
[02:16:30.931 --> 02:16:34.054]  And they've since admitted they're preparing for mass quarantines and lockdowns.
[02:16:34.054 --> 02:16:35.215]  That doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[02:16:35.215 --> 02:16:36.316]  They're just preparing for it.
[02:16:36.316 --> 02:16:41.860]  I want to make that clear, that clear distinction there.
[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:42.521]  But go ahead.
[02:16:43.291 --> 02:16:44.332]  Yeah, I didn't really.
[02:16:44.332 --> 02:16:49.376]  I mean, whenever y'all were talking about bracelets, it was kind of, you know, I didn't really believe it.
[02:16:49.376 --> 02:16:52.318]  Or not that I didn't believe it, but I just didn't know how it worked.
[02:16:52.318 --> 02:17:01.606]  And I went to the Galveston County Office of Emergency website, and they're showing little kids putting on these bracelets on the website.
[02:17:01.606 --> 02:17:03.307]  Excuse me?
[02:17:03.307 --> 02:17:04.588]  Now, I want to put you on hold.
[02:17:04.588 --> 02:17:08.692]  I want you to send this to an email address we're going to give you.
[02:17:08.692 --> 02:17:11.034]  What's the best one to give him off there that's a direct line to us?
[02:17:13.069 --> 02:17:17.393]  John, John, John, give them Hartman's email.
[02:17:17.393 --> 02:17:20.575]  So this is the Galveston County Office of Emergency Management.
[02:17:20.575 --> 02:17:24.319]  It shows them getting the bracelets that they've had the shots.
[02:17:24.319 --> 02:17:33.086]  No, not that they've had the shots, but that they're, I guess, it's got the Boy Scouts earned emergency merit badge.
[02:17:33.086 --> 02:17:34.327]  Come on, talk about merit badges.
[02:17:34.327 --> 02:17:35.128]  You said bracelets.
[02:17:35.128 --> 02:17:36.769]  What are they getting bracelets for?
[02:17:36.769 --> 02:17:40.852]  Well, I think they're just doing some kind of drill.
[02:17:42.176 --> 02:17:43.337]  Well, what does it say?
[02:17:43.337 --> 02:17:43.777]  Okay.
[02:17:43.777 --> 02:17:47.039]  So that's the Galveston Office of Emergency Management.
[02:17:47.039 --> 02:17:48.961]  What does the header on the article say?
[02:18:03.034 --> 02:18:11.397]  Oh yeah, they did say in Texas when you're in evacuee they want to make you take a bracelet.
[02:18:11.397 --> 02:18:14.158]  Yeah, no, I saw that with Rick Perry six months ago.
[02:18:14.158 --> 02:18:17.499]  Okay, so new technology helps with evacuee preparedness.
[02:18:17.499 --> 02:18:17.839]  Is that it?
[02:18:19.551 --> 02:18:19.871]  Thank you.
[02:18:19.871 --> 02:18:20.451]  We'll pull it up.
[02:18:20.451 --> 02:18:21.992]  Yes, I am aware of that.
[02:18:21.992 --> 02:18:26.933]  Well, that's just like they're announcing they want you to wear shock bracelets to everybody that gets on the airplane.
[02:18:26.933 --> 02:18:28.714]  Homeland Security did consider that.
[02:18:28.714 --> 02:18:33.996]  Or they're announcing that the city police everywhere want neighbors to spy on neighbors.
[02:18:33.996 --> 02:18:39.677]  And there's another article where they're admitting they want to put passive MRIs scanning us on the highways.
[02:18:39.677 --> 02:18:41.398]  Mike Rivero, closing comments on that.
[02:18:42.116 --> 02:18:47.861]  Yeah, we're getting into this total scan surveillance now because of that botched assassination attempt in Saudi Arabia.
[02:18:47.861 --> 02:18:53.386]  They're talking about literally scanning the insides of our bodies before we're allowed on airplanes.
[02:18:53.386 --> 02:18:54.667]  You know, we're getting into this.
[02:18:54.667 --> 02:18:55.708]  X-rays!
[02:18:55.708 --> 02:18:56.609]  X-raying the people.
[02:18:56.609 --> 02:18:57.329]  Get a chest X-ray.
[02:18:57.329 --> 02:18:57.690]  Here we go.
[02:18:58.598 --> 02:19:13.087]  Yeah, and it's reached a ridiculous degree because, you know, from bracelets the next step will be the implantable chip and the idea is to get us all tagged with a number so that we can be tracked and taxed and there is no escape from the system.
[02:19:13.087 --> 02:19:20.212]  And that's really what it's all about is making sure that nobody can decide to go off the grid and not be part of the farm animals.
[02:19:21.326 --> 02:19:21.966]  Absolutely.
[02:19:21.966 --> 02:19:28.148]  Homeland Security plans to scan air travelers bodily functions.
[02:19:28.148 --> 02:19:29.428]  And here's another one.
[02:19:29.428 --> 02:19:33.249]  New technology assist with evacuee tracking.
[02:19:33.249 --> 02:19:38.710]  And there they are getting the little bracelets that they also have been reporting they're going to make us take at the checkpoints.
[02:19:38.710 --> 02:19:43.571]  If you don't have that bracelet, you'll be taken off to a FEMA camp, according to police and military that are speaking out.
[02:19:43.571 --> 02:19:46.152]  And Homeland Security says, yes, we are studying that right now.
[02:19:47.052 --> 02:19:48.374]  Thank you so much, Mike Rivera.
[02:19:48.374 --> 02:19:50.717]  We'll see you next month at WhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:19:50.717 --> 02:19:52.639]  Of course, as always, we'll be able to check you out there.
[02:19:52.639 --> 02:19:54.502]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[02:19:54.502 --> 02:19:55.623]  Thank you for having me.
[02:19:55.623 --> 02:19:56.705]  You bet.
[02:19:56.705 --> 02:19:58.727]  Camp FEMA directors and producers coming up.
[02:19:58.727 --> 02:19:59.148]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.232 --> 02:20:04.753]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:20:04.753 --> 02:20:06.754]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:20:06.754 --> 02:20:12.315]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:20:12.315 --> 02:20:20.338]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[02:20:20.338 --> 02:20:31.081]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[02:20:31.121 --> 02:20:31.681]  I think so.
[02:21:01.297 --> 02:21:02.718]  It is a big idea.
[02:21:02.718 --> 02:21:05.540]  A New World Order.
[02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:10.084]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:21:10.084 --> 02:21:13.266]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:21:13.266 --> 02:21:16.048]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:21:16.048 --> 02:21:19.230]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:21:19.230 --> 02:21:26.516]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:21:29.568 --> 02:21:34.505]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:21:35.017 --> 02:21:38.878]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:21:38.878 --> 02:21:41.459]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:21:41.459 --> 02:21:42.619]  Most people have no idea.
[02:21:42.619 --> 02:21:43.399]  They're not after money.
[02:21:43.399 --> 02:21:44.680]  They have all the money they need.
[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:45.660]  They're after power.
[02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:46.800]  That's what they're after.
[02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:51.562]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:21:51.562 --> 02:21:55.523]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:55.523 --> 02:21:56.283]  Endgame.
[02:21:56.283 --> 02:21:58.324]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:21:58.324 --> 02:21:59.484]  You have been warned.
[02:22:00.228 --> 02:22:06.890]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:06.890 --> 02:22:15.012]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.012 --> 02:22:23.174]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.174 --> 02:22:27.935]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.275 --> 02:22:33.498]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.498 --> 02:22:37.840]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:38.920]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:43.423]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:43.423 --> 02:22:48.345]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:48.345 --> 02:22:51.327]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:51.327 --> 02:22:52.967]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.149 --> 02:22:58.410]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:58.410 --> 02:23:01.991]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:23:01.991 --> 02:23:07.853]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:23:07.853 --> 02:23:15.916]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[02:23:16.846 --> 02:23:19.688]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[02:23:19.688 --> 02:23:25.551]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:23:25.551 --> 02:23:28.833]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[02:23:28.833 --> 02:23:31.215]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:23:31.215 --> 02:23:36.098]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[02:23:36.098 --> 02:23:39.840]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:41.381]  So get it while you still can.
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:45.981]  Order OxySilver online at OxySilver.com.
[02:23:45.981 --> 02:23:49.562]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[02:23:49.562 --> 02:23:52.703]  Call toll-free 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:23:52.703 --> 02:23:55.343]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:23:55.343 --> 02:23:57.024]  Order OxySilver today.
[02:23:57.024 --> 02:23:58.484]  This call could save your life.
[02:24:15.626 --> 02:24:23.693]  William Lewis, maker of Camp FEMA, joins us along with the producer Gary Franchi.
[02:24:23.693 --> 02:24:27.836]  When they approached me about being in the film, I was very excited and I consulted on it.
[02:24:27.836 --> 02:24:34.141]  I worked with them on making sure the information was accurate and they've done a great job.
[02:24:34.141 --> 02:24:40.946]  It shows how we've turned into a prison economy, how our entire economy is converting over to surveillance, prisons, police state.
[02:24:41.772 --> 02:24:43.953]  We have more prisons than any other country in the world.
[02:24:43.953 --> 02:24:50.156]  The federal government designates sports stadiums and other facilities as mass holding centers, mass inoculation centers.
[02:24:50.156 --> 02:24:51.297]  They go over all of that.
[02:24:51.297 --> 02:24:53.178]  They show the gun confiscations in New Orleans.
[02:24:53.178 --> 02:24:58.661]  They show the Rex 84, the admitted camp plans, the government documents.
[02:24:58.661 --> 02:25:00.962]  They actually go out to some of the camps.
[02:25:00.962 --> 02:25:08.826]  And I just got back from spending three days in Hardin, Montana
[02:25:09.881 --> 02:25:16.666]  Just to show how corrupt society is, where a known convicted felon con artist could just come into town.
[02:25:16.666 --> 02:25:23.172]  The tiny town of three and a half thousand built a 464 bed prison.
[02:25:23.172 --> 02:25:25.393]  They wanted to put Abu Ghraib people in there.
[02:25:25.393 --> 02:25:27.875]  They wanted to put Camp X-Ray people in there.
[02:25:27.875 --> 02:25:31.899]  Now they just want to put the citizens and they call it an economic development plan.
[02:25:31.899 --> 02:25:32.659]  Prisons!
[02:25:32.659 --> 02:25:34.441]  That's what we have is putting you in jail.
[02:25:35.751 --> 02:25:45.439]  And so this is all around us, and then you dovetail it with all the surveillance, and the Big Brother, and the Homeland Security plans to scan air travelers' bodily functions.
[02:25:45.439 --> 02:25:55.788]  All of this is unfolding, so I wanted to get the makers of Camp FEMA on today, and I wanted to remind listeners we have it available at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:25:55.788 --> 02:25:58.570]  Again, InfoWars.com.
[02:25:58.570 --> 02:26:03.955]  It is available for everybody out there.
[02:26:06.384 --> 02:26:13.629]  Uh, we hope that people will go and order it and show it to their friends and family because this film needs to be seen.
[02:26:13.629 --> 02:26:15.370]  Camp FEMA available right now.
[02:26:15.370 --> 02:26:17.671]  Let's go to Gary Franchi and William Lewis.
[02:26:17.671 --> 02:26:23.295]  Guys, good to have you on the show with us.
[02:26:23.295 --> 02:26:24.716]  Uh, let's go to Franchi first.
[02:26:24.716 --> 02:26:33.722]  Franchi, uh, this is your first, I guess, big direct, uh, not directorial, but producer debut, and I'm glad that the film's a success because it needs to be seen.
[02:26:35.247 --> 02:26:56.373]  Absolutely, and you mentioned it yourself just now, but home screenings, and we want people to invite their friends and family over to their house, sit down and analyze the film, take the facts in, and spread this message to their loved ones, because what's happening in America needs to stop.
[02:26:57.182 --> 02:27:06.747]  You know, the demonizing of constitutional Americans in the BIAC report, Homeland Security documents, you know, the growth of this prison-industrial complex that you just went off to harden.
[02:27:06.747 --> 02:27:12.509]  I mean, these are all facts that are covered in the film that, you know, obviously the mainstream media doesn't want to cover.
[02:27:12.509 --> 02:27:16.471]  Glenn Beck is just whitewashing the whole thing with popular mechanics.
[02:27:16.471 --> 02:27:22.514]  And, you know, these facts need to be exposed, and that's why we put the film together, just to do that.
[02:27:24.292 --> 02:27:26.453]  Well, I'm glad you did it.
[02:27:26.453 --> 02:27:27.834]  Let's go to William Lewis.
[02:27:27.834 --> 02:27:31.736]  William, in a nutshell, break down what Camp FEMA covers.
[02:27:31.736 --> 02:27:32.156]  Okay.
[02:27:32.156 --> 02:27:38.720]  Camp FEMA, we start back in the 1940s, show people how these internment camps are really nothing new.
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:40.301]  This has happened before.
[02:27:40.301 --> 02:27:53.949]  We show the similarities between those camps that were built back in the 1940s and the HR 645 legislation that we see introduced recently by Alcee Hastings of Florida, and we compare
[02:27:54.801 --> 02:27:55.982]  What did they do back then?
[02:27:55.982 --> 02:27:57.103]  What do they want in this bill?
[02:27:57.103 --> 02:27:58.183]  How similar are they?
[02:27:58.183 --> 02:28:01.345]  And, you know, come to find out they're very similar, in fact.
[02:28:01.345 --> 02:28:11.672]  We go through all of the legislation, the documentation, SDI, Senate COINTELPRO, everything, trying to explain to people that this is really nothing new.
[02:28:11.672 --> 02:28:13.233]  This is a pattern we've established.
[02:28:13.943 --> 02:28:21.467]  And, you know, we even see some of the same wording and the same phrases come up telling us what they want to do to us, how they want to do it.
[02:28:21.467 --> 02:28:26.850]  And now they've got internment camps being, you know, just built right out in the open.
[02:28:26.850 --> 02:28:29.051]  Contractors being hired to do it.
[02:28:29.051 --> 02:28:36.955]  And, you know, the National Guard is actually actively hiring for these positions of internment and resettlement specialists.
[02:28:36.955 --> 02:28:41.738]  So you put all this together, put some photos with it, and we kind of show
[02:28:43.055 --> 02:28:54.717]  Show people that FEMA camps are no longer this internet-based conspiracy theory, but it is very much based in reality and based in black and white, as we've shown in the documentary.
[02:28:55.788 --> 02:28:57.529]  And the denial is over with this film.
[02:28:57.529 --> 02:29:00.610]  I mean, the rumors and the documentation is total.
[02:29:00.610 --> 02:29:07.113]  We need to have a national debate about how they're setting up fusion centers, putting brigade homeland on the streets, taking over our society.
[02:29:07.113 --> 02:29:09.994]  Can't FEMA does that?
[02:29:09.994 --> 02:29:11.455]  And so the denial can end.
[02:29:11.455 --> 02:29:13.415]  This country is turning into a giant prison grid.
[02:29:13.415 --> 02:29:20.839]  The military industrial complex is just coming back to America and taking us over and ruling us and making their police state profitable.
[02:29:20.839 --> 02:29:24.120]  You have all these private interests that make the profits off what they've set up.
[02:29:26.172 --> 02:29:27.393]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[02:29:27.393 --> 02:29:32.196]  Look at the person who made Labor Program.
[02:29:32.196 --> 02:29:32.857]  Absolutely.
[02:29:32.857 --> 02:29:34.578]  All right, men.
[02:29:34.578 --> 02:29:34.958]  Stay there.
[02:29:34.958 --> 02:29:35.639]  I want to come back.
[02:29:35.639 --> 02:29:42.824]  I want people to be able to call in, too, and ask you guys questions about Camp FEMA and what you've learned about the New World Order's Gulag Archipelago.
[02:29:42.824 --> 02:29:45.926]  We'll tie it into Hardin, Montana, with big developments there on the other side.
[02:29:45.926 --> 02:29:46.626]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:46.626 --> 02:29:51.670]  More financial news and flu news coming up, too.
[02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:53.051]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.051 --> 02:29:54.552]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.567 --> 02:30:00.909]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.909 --> 02:30:05.151]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.151 --> 02:30:07.152]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.152 --> 02:30:15.675]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.675 --> 02:30:21.217]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.217 --> 02:30:22.838]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.078 --> 02:30:29.599]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.599 --> 02:30:40.642]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.642 --> 02:30:41.402]  That's right.
[02:30:41.402 --> 02:30:43.982]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:43.982 --> 02:30:45.563]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:48.144 --> 02:31:06.236]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.236 --> 02:31:08.317]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:31:08.317 --> 02:31:10.759]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.759 --> 02:31:13.040]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:14.661]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.661 --> 02:31:15.702]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.922 --> 02:31:24.347]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:32:01.323 --> 02:32:10.246]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[02:33:50.081 --> 02:33:55.925]  Before we go back to our guest in Camp FEMA and start taking some of your phone calls getting to the new developments at the Hardin Jail.
[02:33:57.546 --> 02:34:05.734]  I want to encourage everybody to go to InfoWars.com today and get your pre-order in today.
[02:34:05.734 --> 02:34:16.005]  Get your pre-order in today for the new documentary film, Fall of the Republic.

[02:34:19.679 --> 02:34:21.239]  It's off being mass produced right now.
[02:34:21.239 --> 02:34:24.480]  We'll get it the next week and a half or so and it will be shipped directly out to you.

[02:34:25.860 --> 02:34:29.201]  Your purchase also makes this radio show possible and all we do.
[02:34:29.201 --> 02:34:34.702]  This is my most powerful film yet.
[02:34:34.702 --> 02:34:42.783]  And again, you can go up to followtherepublic.com and watch the latest trailer that really gives you an idea of what's covered in the film.
[02:34:42.783 --> 02:34:46.124]  You can also go to prisonplanet.tv and watch the latest trailer.
[02:34:46.124 --> 02:34:47.544]  It will premiere there October 21st.
[02:34:49.651 --> 02:34:57.558]  At PrisonPlanet.tv for all the wonderful members there that are also watching us live as we simulcast right now.
[02:34:57.558 --> 02:35:01.721]  But I just want to ask everybody to make this the biggest film we've ever released.
[02:35:01.721 --> 02:35:02.962]  To make it the most viral.
[02:35:02.962 --> 02:35:04.263]  To spread it on the internet.
[02:35:04.263 --> 02:35:05.324]  To make copies of it.
[02:35:05.324 --> 02:35:07.746]  To give it to your friends, your families, and neighbors.
[02:35:07.746 --> 02:35:08.987]  They cannot stop the signal.
[02:35:08.987 --> 02:35:14.432]  This exposes who the bankers are, what they're doing, what they're setting up, and how we can stop them.
[02:35:14.432 --> 02:35:17.034]  It's Fall of the Republic, Volume 1.
[02:35:17.034 --> 02:35:18.215]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:29.321]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:35:29.321 --> 02:35:33.303]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:35:33.303 --> 02:35:38.124]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:35:38.124 --> 02:35:44.386]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:35:46.152 --> 02:35:51.355]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[02:35:51.355 --> 02:35:58.239]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:35:58.239 --> 02:36:02.421]  One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes.
[02:36:05.871 --> 02:36:07.032]  Go sit down.
[02:36:07.032 --> 02:36:09.374]  I have a question for this young man.
[02:36:09.374 --> 02:36:11.576]  He has the right to be represented.
[02:36:11.576 --> 02:36:23.827]  It's up to every man, woman, and child in the United States to decide whether we're going to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers or whether we're going to restore the republic.
[02:36:23.827 --> 02:36:28.851]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today seems like nobody does care.
[02:36:28.851 --> 02:36:33.515]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:36:38.575 --> 02:36:40.596]  Who's going to soak up the derivatives?
[02:36:40.596 --> 02:36:42.158]  Who's going to soak up the debt?
[02:36:42.158 --> 02:36:43.959]  Who's going to be penalized?
[02:36:43.959 --> 02:36:54.166]  Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[02:36:54.166 --> 02:36:54.627]  I don't know.
[02:36:54.627 --> 02:37:01.532]  Do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that provision of the Constitution to hand out half a trillion dollars to foreigners?
[02:37:01.532 --> 02:37:04.674]  Will we choose liberty or will we choose tyranny?
[02:37:04.674 --> 02:37:06.756]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[02:37:07.216 --> 02:37:09.097]  You don't have a president.
[02:37:09.097 --> 02:37:10.137]  You have an actor.
[02:37:10.137 --> 02:37:12.798]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:37:12.798 --> 02:37:14.719]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:37:14.719 --> 02:37:17.099]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:37:17.099 --> 02:37:19.000]  Who do we sell these matches to?
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:24.922]  The last vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away.
[02:37:24.922 --> 02:37:27.763]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:37:27.763 --> 02:37:29.243]  Volume 1.
[02:37:29.243 --> 02:37:30.744]  Presidency of Barack Obama.
[02:37:31.966 --> 02:37:38.832]  Available on DVD at InfoWars.com and online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:38.832 --> 02:37:42.876]  The destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[02:37:42.876 --> 02:37:44.457]  October 21st, 2009.
[02:37:44.457 --> 02:37:48.681]  Alright, that is the new trailer.
[02:37:48.681 --> 02:37:51.644]  It's going up on the Alex Jones Channel at YouTube in the next few minutes.
[02:37:51.644 --> 02:37:54.767]  Please help spread it virally, just like you've done with
[02:37:55.728 --> 02:37:56.929]  Camp FEMA.
[02:37:56.929 --> 02:38:00.411]  But this Fall of the Republic film gets into everything.
[02:38:00.411 --> 02:38:06.515]  The mind control, the bankers, who they are, their master plan, how to stop them, what they're doing.
[02:38:06.515 --> 02:38:10.817]  The establishment can only succeed if the people are not aware of what's going on.
[02:38:10.817 --> 02:38:17.721]  You are the ones that will make Fall of the Republic effective, just like you did with the Obama deception and are continuing to do.
[02:38:17.721 --> 02:38:25.306]  Going back to Gary Franchi and William Lewis, you guys aren't watching us, I guess, on PrisonPlanet.tv, but hearing that, does that sound pretty exciting?
[02:38:26.286 --> 02:38:28.647]  Oh, I can't wait to see it.
[02:38:28.647 --> 02:38:30.648]  I'm excited.
[02:38:30.648 --> 02:38:32.329]  We're going to get free copy, right?
[02:38:32.329 --> 02:38:33.370]  Absolutely, Lewis!
[02:38:33.370 --> 02:38:36.552]  Alright, alright.
[02:38:36.552 --> 02:38:37.732]  Enough of me talking about that.
[02:38:37.732 --> 02:38:39.013]  I just know people will pre-order.
[02:38:39.013 --> 02:38:40.674]  We want to have a big push right up front.
[02:38:40.674 --> 02:38:44.996]  Everybody getting copies, making copies, spreading it, getting it out to everybody.
[02:38:44.996 --> 02:38:47.518]  We've got all sorts of harassment going on over this film.
[02:38:47.518 --> 02:38:48.278]  Later it'll come out.
[02:38:48.278 --> 02:38:49.779]  We're getting harassment out of Chicago.
[02:38:51.374 --> 02:38:52.154]  Well, no death threat yet.
[02:38:52.154 --> 02:38:54.055]  Actually, the reception for Camp FEMA has been quite well.
[02:39:19.477 --> 02:39:29.642]  You know, we get tons of emails just on a daily basis that I never have the time to return every single one of them, but we try.
[02:39:29.642 --> 02:39:31.323]  Maybe we should go through a list.
[02:39:31.323 --> 02:39:33.444]  You know, we've got several things coming up.
[02:39:33.444 --> 02:39:39.147]  The Midwest Liberty Fest is coming up this weekend where people can go out and watch Camp FEMA there.
[02:39:39.147 --> 02:39:44.050]  There's a Canadian theatrical premiere coming up in Toronto on October the 17th.
[02:39:45.490 --> 02:39:47.893]  And that's going to be pretty big from what I understand.
[02:39:47.893 --> 02:39:54.880]  I won't be able to attend neither will Gary, but you should if you're in the Toronto area at least show up and see what's going on.
[02:39:56.513 --> 02:40:01.315]  Then we've got, you know, right after that, the next day, there's another screening in Ohio.
[02:40:01.315 --> 02:40:02.915]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[02:40:02.915 --> 02:40:03.836]  Yeah, that's exciting.
[02:40:03.836 --> 02:40:05.776]  People are out there spreading and getting involved.
[02:40:05.776 --> 02:40:06.697]  That's important.
[02:40:06.697 --> 02:40:09.418]  More about the film, though, for people that haven't seen it.
[02:40:09.418 --> 02:40:12.299]  I mean, he could... I mean, I, of course, am in the film.
[02:40:12.299 --> 02:40:13.139]  Other great people are.
[02:40:13.139 --> 02:40:18.641]  But the point is, it really lays out just the facts and exposes what's going on.
[02:40:18.641 --> 02:40:23.443]  We can't talk about FEMA camps without talking about the mindset of our leaders in Washington.
[02:40:24.125 --> 02:40:26.306]  And how this has been done in history's past.
[02:40:26.306 --> 02:40:32.669]  How have past dictatorial regimes come into power?
[02:40:32.669 --> 02:40:38.351]  How did they get the people in Germany to go along with rounding up the Jews?
[02:40:38.351 --> 02:40:40.272]  Those are the types of things that we're looking at.
[02:40:40.272 --> 02:40:47.115]  We've gone out to people like Chuck Baldwin, who was specifically named in the Mayak Report, to tell us how they've done this in the past.
[02:40:47.797 --> 02:41:01.484]  And, um, you know, we know that they want to demonize and marginalize everything that anyone says who might be opposed to gun control, or opposed to income tax, abortion, illegal immigration, whatever your single issue is.
[02:41:01.484 --> 02:41:02.884]  The private Federal Reserve!
[02:41:02.884 --> 02:41:04.065]  They demonize those groups!
[02:41:04.915 --> 02:41:05.876]  United Nations.
[02:41:05.876 --> 02:41:07.917]  People who use the term the New World Order.
[02:41:07.917 --> 02:41:14.542]  That's why we have some representation in here from the Constitution Party because, you know, that's even in, I believe, a part of their platform.
[02:41:14.542 --> 02:41:25.049]  And I was just researching last night on some of these third parties that are out there and, you know, even on Wikipedia they put New World Order in these quotes like it doesn't really exist.
[02:41:25.049 --> 02:41:30.833]  Though I have more than 10 mainstream news articles saying the demise of the dollar, rise of the New World Order.
[02:41:30.833 --> 02:41:32.574]  You know, that's what we say.
[02:41:32.574 --> 02:41:33.455]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:41:34.727 --> 02:41:37.070]  Birth of the New World Order, rise of the resistance.
[02:41:37.070 --> 02:41:47.841]  I mean, they're announcing world government owned and run by private banks, what we always said it would be, we were reading their own documents, and they still say it doesn't exist.
[02:41:47.841 --> 02:41:49.823]  That's a military psych warfare term.
[02:41:50.782 --> 02:41:51.322]  That's done.
[02:41:51.322 --> 02:41:55.743]  That out of hand... Gary Franchi, speak to that, because I know you've studied it.
[02:41:55.743 --> 02:42:02.525]  How they'll deny something, even as it's happening, to make it about the debate of whether it exists or not.
[02:42:02.525 --> 02:42:11.367]  It's like, I'm still debating with Hardin Montana, is this guy a felon when it's admitted he's a felon con artist?
[02:42:11.367 --> 02:42:14.287]  And I'm telling him for a week it's a fake contract.
[02:42:14.287 --> 02:42:15.407]  Go ahead.
[02:42:15.407 --> 02:42:17.548]  I'm just saying, it's classical William Doublespeak.
[02:42:18.342 --> 02:42:21.925]  You know, they say it is when it isn't, and when it is, it's not.
[02:42:21.925 --> 02:42:25.968]  You know, it's just playing my game with the American people.
[02:42:25.968 --> 02:42:27.990]  I'm like, you just quoted all these headlines.
[02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:33.674]  I've seen the headlines out there in the mainstream news, saying that the New World Order is rising up.
[02:42:33.674 --> 02:42:37.437]  You know, and that meanwhile they demonize us because we're going to go ahead and fight it.
[02:42:37.437 --> 02:42:39.059]  And they marginalize us.
[02:42:39.059 --> 02:42:44.042]  But the problem is, they're giving us more fuel, more energy to fight.
[02:42:44.042 --> 02:42:45.704]  And that's what this film does, that's what you do.
[02:42:46.607 --> 02:42:54.032]  We put the message out so we can fight the New World Order, take it down, and restore our Republic.
[02:42:54.032 --> 02:42:58.314]  Absolutely.
[02:42:58.314 --> 02:42:59.015]  Continuing...
[02:43:00.714 --> 02:43:02.114]  Just what the news were witnessing.
[02:43:02.114 --> 02:43:15.157]  Before I get into some other facets of the police state, what did you guys think about the Hardin situation with the mercenaries and taking over the prison facility they wanted to hold prisoners in?
[02:43:15.157 --> 02:43:29.540]  I told local media that when I was inside, we even have footage of this, and Becky Shea saying don't tape that, they had on the wall enemy combatant area, enemy combatant holding, alien holding area,
[02:43:32.886 --> 02:43:35.448]  Alien detaining holding area is the exact quote.
[02:43:35.448 --> 02:43:46.261]  The local newspaper spun that and said Jones was on air saying packets of mustard in Becky Shea's desk were mustard gas.
[02:43:47.881 --> 02:43:53.604]  I never said anything about mustard, and that space aliens were being kept there.
[02:43:53.604 --> 02:43:56.065]  Now, that's how they spin this.
[02:43:56.065 --> 02:43:58.646]  Becky Shea made a joke in front of the, on the radio.
[02:43:58.646 --> 02:44:01.368]  She said, oh, there's, you know, there's nothing back there.
[02:44:01.368 --> 02:44:06.730]  I don't want you back in that area of the prison because there's nothing but a bunch of mustard packages in the desk.
[02:44:06.730 --> 02:44:13.794]  So her saying a joke about mustard packages on video, we have this on video, turns into, I say there's mustard gas, which I never said.
[02:44:14.674 --> 02:44:17.998]  And I'm saying Space Aliens Area 51 are there.
[02:44:17.998 --> 02:44:18.538]  No!
[02:44:18.538 --> 02:44:26.026]  They had big ol' maps of blueprints saying Alien Detention Area.
[02:44:26.026 --> 02:44:28.168]  Well, here's my take on it, Alex.
[02:44:28.168 --> 02:44:35.997]  From my research and from my talk with National Guardsmen, I've learned that there is a huge swath of good
[02:44:36.738 --> 02:45:03.699]  Americans who are serving this country, and they have said that they will refuse the orders when it comes down to take the guns and to round up people, but the powers that be, the New World Order, needs the private mercenary army to fill the gap when the American military decides, you know, the grunts, the hard-working guys, decide they're not going to follow these orders.
[02:45:03.699 --> 02:45:04.960]  I mean, they're out there saying it.
[02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:16.100]  So, these mercenary forces like Blackwater, like American Police Force, are there to fill the void?
[02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:17.481]  Well, they certainly are.
[02:45:17.481 --> 02:45:26.471]  But, you know, I know Ron Paul got more contributions than anybody else from the military, and I know I run into a lot of even TSA people when I'm flying that are fans and want my signature.
[02:45:26.471 --> 02:45:27.332]  The majority of them.
[02:45:27.332 --> 02:45:28.093]  It's freaking me out.
[02:45:29.121 --> 02:45:31.564]  But then I go to places like Billings, Montana.
[02:45:31.564 --> 02:45:33.206]  They were the worst Nazis I've ever seen.
[02:45:33.206 --> 02:45:35.509]  Harassing old ladies, us.
[02:45:35.509 --> 02:45:36.330]  Really embarrassing.
[02:45:36.330 --> 02:45:37.572]  I was embarrassed for them.
[02:45:37.572 --> 02:45:38.553]  Sickening.
[02:45:38.553 --> 02:45:40.015]  A power trip.
[02:45:40.015 --> 02:45:41.717]  But you look at yesterday.
[02:45:41.717 --> 02:45:43.659]  400 people show up at the park.
[02:45:43.659 --> 02:45:44.541]  They're peaceful.
[02:45:44.541 --> 02:45:46.083]  They're told you're not allowed to protest.
[02:45:46.083 --> 02:45:46.703]  They arrest them.
[02:45:47.544 --> 02:45:51.987]  Uh, G20, old women coming out of stores with bags going, what's going on officer?
[02:45:51.987 --> 02:45:53.188]  Shut up, bitch!
[02:45:53.188 --> 02:45:57.791]  Hitting her with clubs, police dogs attacking her, and then the cops defend it.
[02:45:57.791 --> 02:46:02.234]  Driving down neighborhoods, hitting nine-year-old kids in their front yard playing football.
[02:46:02.234 --> 02:46:03.695]  I mean, the cops were out of control.
[02:46:03.695 --> 02:46:07.998]  My guys got footage hiding in stores of them just driving around attacking anybody on the street.
[02:46:07.998 --> 02:46:12.121]  Then they go over and attack the university two nights in a row.
[02:46:12.121 --> 02:46:14.542]  My guys weren't there on the 24th, so I said go over there on the 25th.
[02:46:16.436 --> 02:46:25.280]  They surrounded the park, wouldn't let the media out, arrested Rob Due, beat up Luke Hradowski, and then charged Due with stuff the night before, even though he wasn't even there.
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:26.861]  He's charged with the 24th!
[02:46:26.861 --> 02:46:29.642]  And we've called the prosecutor, and they're like, that's the way it is!
[02:46:29.642 --> 02:46:30.963]  We don't care if it's the wrong day!
[02:46:30.963 --> 02:46:32.224]  Go to hell!
[02:46:32.224 --> 02:46:43.829]  I mean, it's just a criminal government, and the National Guard was ready to fire sound cannons at people, the police enjoyed running up to women, I mean little, you know, college girls, and going,
[02:46:44.269 --> 02:46:50.753]  You know, we had our own cameraman out there for our show, The Reality Report, Lee.
[02:46:50.753 --> 02:46:52.975]  You know, he was rounded up right alongside Lee.
[02:46:52.975 --> 02:46:54.716]  And all he was doing, he was rounded up right alongside Luke.
[02:46:54.716 --> 02:46:57.018]  And all he was doing was pointing a camera in the direction of tyranny.
[02:47:14.346 --> 02:47:29.736]  You know, I mean, these police, like you say, when they're lined up, when they've got all their body armor on, they've got their gas, yes, there is a gang mentality that takes over, you know, and they want that paycheck.
[02:47:29.736 --> 02:47:32.238]  So, you know, we have to get to the police and military.
[02:47:32.238 --> 02:47:34.279]  We have to reach out to them.
[02:47:34.279 --> 02:47:39.223]  They are the front lines, and we have to wake them up, too.
[02:47:39.223 --> 02:47:40.203]  Well, absolutely.
[02:47:42.637 --> 02:47:45.678]  Well, let me get into the Hardin situation.
[02:47:45.678 --> 02:47:53.920]  We found out last Sunday, I heard about it Friday, didn't check into it, but last, not this Sunday, the same before, like 10, 11 days ago.
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:58.181]  We found out that this guy was a felon.
[02:47:58.181 --> 02:47:59.541]  We found out he had aliases.
[02:47:59.541 --> 02:48:01.842]  We found out he was tied into these other defense contractors.
[02:48:03.206 --> 02:48:08.270]  We found out he didn't have a license to take over the giant detention center, $27 million.
[02:48:08.270 --> 02:48:09.671]  They were policing the town.
[02:48:09.671 --> 02:48:12.613]  They had gone to city council saying, we're going to be your new police.
[02:48:12.613 --> 02:48:14.595]  That's now admitted in the news, Billings Gazette.
[02:48:16.324 --> 02:48:21.609]  And I went to Hardin, and the locals were all, most of them were fans of the show, it blew me away.
[02:48:21.609 --> 02:48:30.356]  But the constabulary, the local sheriff's people and others, they were on power trips, saying, why don't you get out of here, you don't belong around here, but this guy's from Serbia, well we like him.
[02:48:30.356 --> 02:48:35.781]  And I would say, but he's a convicted felon, he's a con artist, he doesn't have the money to lease this facility.
[02:48:35.781 --> 02:48:39.464]  He wants, he's in a police uniform, he's just gonna suck off the town.
[02:48:39.464 --> 02:48:40.185]  He's a convicted 14-time
[02:48:42.907 --> 02:48:48.511]  Grand, you know, theft, criminal, he wants to be in a badge and gun, a true criminal regime.
[02:48:48.511 --> 02:48:50.212]  And they said, we don't care if he's a criminal.
[02:48:50.212 --> 02:48:56.757]  Some of the locals told me, because they thought they were part of the establishment, and they said, no, he's real.
[02:48:56.757 --> 02:48:59.059]  Now, he's the head of American Police Force.
[02:48:59.059 --> 02:49:03.182]  Then they called up a lawyer who was supposedly the head, and he said, no, I'm not even part of it.
[02:49:03.182 --> 02:49:03.482]  Now,
[02:49:05.714 --> 02:49:13.937]  They described the Two Rivers Authority meeting last night in the Billings Gazette as if the one guy was bad who said, I don't want to be part of this and this is a fraud.
[02:49:13.937 --> 02:49:17.338]  The other members were still saying, we want to do this deal.
[02:49:17.338 --> 02:49:27.282]  So even when they know it's a con artist, know it's a fraud, know it's a scam, the locals wanted to literally police the town themselves and literally be predators.
[02:49:27.282 --> 02:49:31.643]  And here it is, red flags cause Montana officials to nix American police force deal.
[02:49:31.643 --> 02:49:32.783]  There was no deal.
[02:49:32.783 --> 02:49:33.404]  It was a scam.
[02:49:34.324 --> 02:49:41.385]  California judge orders head of Hardin Jail Project to court for millions of dollars of fraud.
[02:49:41.385 --> 02:49:44.926]  Two Rivers Board raises questions about Hardin prison contract.
[02:49:44.926 --> 02:49:46.686]  It's all a fraud.
[02:49:46.686 --> 02:49:49.147]  APF frontman loses credibility in Hardin.
[02:49:49.147 --> 02:50:00.789]  The reason I bring this up, guys, is that if mercenaries can just show up, and he did have German and other mercenaries with him, and think they're just going to, and they were going to get away with it until we got involved, the listeners especially.
[02:50:00.789 --> 02:50:02.569]  And we are blamed by the locals for stopping it.
[02:50:03.109 --> 02:50:03.769]  They're very angry.
[02:50:03.769 --> 02:50:05.831]  They're not mad that we warned them about a con artist.
[02:50:05.831 --> 02:50:07.352]  They wanted to be part of it.
[02:50:07.352 --> 02:50:08.492]  They wanted to do this.
[02:50:08.492 --> 02:50:09.553]  They loved him.
[02:50:09.553 --> 02:50:12.555]  It was, you know, thugs loving thugs.
[02:50:12.555 --> 02:50:17.858]  That in America, any type of criminal operation can just take over as long as it's wearing a badge.
[02:50:17.858 --> 02:50:18.479]  Gary Franchi?
[02:50:19.261 --> 02:50:22.843]  Well, you know, they are willing to take the money and run.
[02:50:22.843 --> 02:50:24.424]  That's what it comes down to, you know?
[02:50:24.424 --> 02:50:30.908]  They get these big promises from this guy, this fraud, this charlatan, to come into town like a snake oil salesman.
[02:50:30.908 --> 02:50:35.651]  I'm going to boost your economy, I'm going to bring all these jobs, and I'm going to employ all of your people.
[02:50:35.651 --> 02:50:36.972]  That's all they saw.
[02:50:36.972 --> 02:50:38.733]  That's all they saw.
[02:50:38.733 --> 02:50:39.894]  They didn't look at the repercussions.
[02:50:39.894 --> 02:50:43.436]  They just saw the dollars, son.
[02:50:43.436 --> 02:50:46.358]  I want to get William Lewis' take on this, but there's the big development.
[02:50:48.499 --> 02:50:50.744]  He did meet with a bunch of big defense contractors.
[02:50:50.744 --> 02:50:53.109]  He was talking about contracting with them there.
[02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:54.191]  But they aren't involved.
[02:50:54.191 --> 02:50:55.574]  There are no backers.
[02:50:55.574 --> 02:50:57.177]  It's all a complete fraud.
[02:50:57.177 --> 02:50:59.342]  And the local town boss hogs, they love him.
[02:51:01.274 --> 02:51:05.157]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[02:51:05.157 --> 02:51:15.325]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[02:51:15.325 --> 02:51:19.248]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at InfoWars.com.
[02:51:19.248 --> 02:51:21.209]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:51:21.209 --> 02:51:24.652]  Cal Bend Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[02:51:25.032 --> 02:51:27.594]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[02:51:27.594 --> 02:51:32.799]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[02:51:37.823 --> 02:51:42.747]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:51:43.187 --> 02:51:44.469]  Don't take my word for it.

[02:52:04.415 --> 02:52:05.075]  It's here!
[02:52:05.075 --> 02:52:10.237]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:52:10.237 --> 02:52:18.561]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:52:18.561 --> 02:52:26.024]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:52:26.024 --> 02:52:32.887]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:52:33.402 --> 02:52:37.745]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:37.745 --> 02:52:41.707]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:41.707 --> 02:52:43.968]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:43.968 --> 02:52:48.411]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:53:01.254 --> 02:53:01.474]  I'm good.
[02:53:26.792 --> 02:53:27.392]  We're good to go.
[02:53:52.961 --> 02:53:53.741]  We're good to go.
[02:54:10.538 --> 02:54:16.043]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[02:54:16.043 --> 02:54:21.467]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[02:54:21.467 --> 02:54:24.169]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'.
[02:54:24.169 --> 02:54:26.871]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:54:26.871 --> 02:54:31.895]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:54:34.767 --> 02:54:39.228]  We're going to open the phones up in the next hour on any issue you wish to discuss at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:39.228 --> 02:54:44.090]  William Lewis, the director of Camp FEMA, available right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:00.182 --> 02:55:05.125]  We also have it discounted when you get it, when you pre-order it with the film coming out in just about a week and a half.
[02:55:05.125 --> 02:55:06.646]  And that, of course, is Fall of the Republic.
[02:55:06.646 --> 02:55:09.208]  I'm so excited about this documentary.
[02:55:09.208 --> 02:55:19.175]  William, your comments on the mercenaries, your comments on this story, of how, when they even knew he was a fraud and a scam and wanted to police the locals, they just said, big deal, so what?
[02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:25.099]  I mean, it's just, we have this criminal class in control of our local governments and our federal government.
[02:55:25.899 --> 02:55:28.281]  And it's just going to get worse and worse until we realize this.
[02:55:28.281 --> 02:55:34.105]  Government is not a license to steal for all the boss hog scum that runs it.
[02:55:34.105 --> 02:55:51.358]  Well, all those people are, you know, more than happy to participate in the policing program and be under the, you know, the control of Mr. Culver, but I doubt very many of those people would feel the same way if they were allowed to carry through with this plan.
[02:55:51.358 --> 02:55:53.300]  I was reading an article by D.B.
[02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:53.560]  Kidd
[02:55:54.156 --> 02:55:55.058]  Yes, we are.
[02:56:07.188 --> 02:56:07.348]  Well,
[02:56:34.522 --> 02:56:54.530]  Well, what the locals do, and I want to be clear, we have footage of this, we're walking down Main Street, every other car stops, people are running up, they're fans of the show, we run into some great people in Hardin, but then the small minority of fat cats, they would run up and say, you say there's barricades and that flu's been released here.
[02:56:54.530 --> 02:56:56.571]  We would never say that.
[02:56:56.571 --> 02:56:57.992]  Our guest would bring up the point
[02:56:59.302 --> 02:57:00.583]  Of course.
[02:57:17.958 --> 02:57:18.418]  We're good to go.
[02:57:37.949 --> 02:57:39.471]  But see, that didn't work.
[02:57:39.471 --> 02:57:42.153]  The Attorney General, the FBI's after them now.
[02:57:42.153 --> 02:57:43.555]  Their crap didn't work.
[02:57:43.555 --> 02:57:49.020]  So what these hucksters do in every case is they just throw out, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:57:49.020 --> 02:57:57.208]  But if somebody's walking out of your house with your TV set and your family jewels, you know, you know they're robbing you.
[02:57:57.208 --> 02:57:59.630]  It doesn't matter if they call you a conspiracy theorist.
[02:57:59.630 --> 02:58:01.251]  That doesn't work at a certain point.
[02:58:01.251 --> 02:58:01.572]  Go ahead.
[02:58:02.517 --> 02:58:09.162]  No, I was just going to say, this is nothing new that the media is doing, and those are the same terms that they've used over and over again.
[02:58:09.162 --> 02:58:31.799]  You know, several years ago, when we put out 9-1-1 in plain sight, Beck called us up to go on his program, and we had Dave go on with a photograph that he was supposed to be able to show on air, and before Dave could even get a chance to provide some information and some examination, Glenn Beck called him some kind of a 51 freak in comparison to an Elvis

[02:58:57.890 --> 02:59:02.473]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.473 --> 02:59:08.057]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.337 --> 02:59:13.120]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.120 --> 02:59:16.742]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.742 --> 02:59:21.564]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.564 --> 02:59:28.128]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.128 --> 02:59:30.069]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.

[02:59:41.658 --> 02:59:42.779]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.779 --> 02:59:43.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:20.272]  In fact, who's up next here on my list?
[03:00:20.272 --> 03:00:21.913]  Matthew in Oregon?
[03:00:28.601 --> 03:00:32.023]  Matthew in Oregon, then Nelson, Anthony, Kurt, Scott and others.
[03:00:32.023 --> 03:00:34.264]  You're on the air with the makers of Camp FEMA.
[03:00:34.264 --> 03:00:36.825]  If they can speak about any issue, go ahead.
[03:00:36.825 --> 03:00:43.088]  Yes, my name is Matthew McDaniel and I'm a human rights activist for the Aka people in Thailand.
[03:00:43.088 --> 03:00:48.130]  And currently I'm riding a horse across the United States from Salem, Oregon.
[03:00:48.130 --> 03:00:52.272]  And I'm about 10 miles west of Weatherford near Dallas.
[03:00:53.383 --> 03:01:07.377]  And, uh, I'm just amazed when I go through these small towns in Texas, uh, post-Texas, uh, Schneider, Texas, and, uh, Hanson, Texas, and I asked the little old lady, I said, hey, what's that uniform you got on?
[03:01:07.377 --> 03:01:09.299]  And she said, oh, it's a prison uniform.
[03:01:09.299 --> 03:01:11.541]  I work at the prison.
[03:01:11.541 --> 03:01:12.902]  I said, what, you got a prison here?
[03:01:12.902 --> 03:01:14.484]  Oh, yeah, it's just outside of town.
[03:01:14.484 --> 03:01:16.185]  I said, well, what do you think of that?
[03:01:16.185 --> 03:01:17.547]  She said, well, it's good for jobs.
[03:01:18.684 --> 03:01:27.267]  And, uh, I wonder if, like, you know, they're using these small, falling-apart communities for, uh, putting prisons in, and nobody can see them.
[03:01:27.267 --> 03:01:32.869]  And it's not gonna, it's not gonna get better, it's getting worse, and that's why they're passing laws.
[03:01:32.869 --> 03:01:38.531]  Go to jail for selling eggs, go to jail for garage sales, go to jail for babysitting neighbors' kids.
[03:01:38.531 --> 03:01:47.715]  They're making everything criminal, and then telling neighbors to spy on neighbors because they've admitted the new economy is gonna be in prison or managing the prison.
[03:01:48.595 --> 03:01:56.697]  Well, did you see the article that said they're going to start fining bloggers if they put misinformation on their blog site?
[03:01:56.697 --> 03:01:58.077]  Yes, I forgot to cover that.
[03:01:58.077 --> 03:02:00.698]  The government agency is going to fine you.
[03:02:00.698 --> 03:02:03.859]  It's going to decide what's true and what isn't.
[03:02:03.859 --> 03:02:10.700]  And absolutely, in the State Department, yes, they, and they're going to have a message that pops up saying your site's not accurate.
[03:02:10.700 --> 03:02:17.282]  I mean, if you say that Iraq didn't have WMDs, they're going to say you're evil and fine you, because everybody knows they had nukes.
[03:02:19.381 --> 03:02:26.347]  You have on your website one of my videos from with the Aka people in Northern Thailand.
[03:02:26.347 --> 03:02:28.488]  Oh, you know, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[03:02:28.488 --> 03:02:34.813]  When you mention those people, yeah, they come and force them tetanus shot after tetanus shot till they have the miscarriage.
[03:02:34.813 --> 03:02:37.115]  So you're the guy that shot those videos?
[03:02:37.115 --> 03:02:37.756]  Right, that's me.
[03:02:38.744 --> 03:02:55.031]  I documented women who said I was forced to have three tetanus toxoid vaccinations during one pregnancy and when I was nine months pregnant I got the vaccination and the same day the baby stopped moving and the baby came out about eight hours later.
[03:02:55.031 --> 03:03:00.694]  You have woman after woman and the UN has been caught
[03:03:01.414 --> 03:03:01.995]  The U.N.
[03:03:01.995 --> 03:03:04.757]  has been caught sterilizing people through the shots.
[03:03:04.757 --> 03:03:07.599]  Yeah, you're only supposed to get one tetanus shot every seven years.
[03:03:07.599 --> 03:03:14.065]  They give the women three special ones, but they found the tetanus is good to bind the female hormone to, to cause the miscarriage.
[03:03:14.065 --> 03:03:14.665]  That's what the U.N.'
[03:03:14.645 --> 03:03:20.950]  's been... So they're murdering babies, which is what this calls for, forced abortion, White House science czar.
[03:03:20.950 --> 03:03:23.653]  And you're the guy I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[03:03:24.790 --> 03:03:30.073]  Well, the thing is, they're focusing it on the minorities, like the Aka Hill Tribe.
[03:03:30.073 --> 03:03:45.302]  And we have all these videos on aka.org, but they're focusing on the Hill Tribe because, you know, I'd ask the nurses, you know, wait, you have a tetanus shot every seven years, why are you making the women come in for three shots during each pregnancy?
[03:03:45.302 --> 03:03:49.444]  And they're telling the women, if you don't, then there's no ID card for your baby.
[03:03:49.444 --> 03:03:51.085]  That's right, no welfare, no money.
[03:03:51.085 --> 03:03:52.906]  Yeah, they use the welfare to get to kill them, yeah.
[03:03:55.336 --> 03:04:04.378]  And so what we're doing now is we're doing a national protest march about the human rights conditions of the Akhas by going across the U.S.
[03:04:04.378 --> 03:04:05.159]  by horseback.
[03:04:05.159 --> 03:04:09.920]  My wife, she's Akha, and we've got five little kids in a bus that says, Ride for Freedom.
[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:24.444]  And, you know, the other thing we've got a big problem with is all these American missionaries going to Northern Thailand and taking away Akha kids and telling their churches that they're orphans if you want to see a big fraud in action.
[03:04:26.055 --> 03:04:28.296]  Well, child kidnapping is what America does.
[03:04:28.296 --> 03:04:31.498]  We kidnap our own kids, we kidnap everybody else's kids.
[03:04:31.498 --> 03:04:34.420]  Hell, they're lucky they just don't go to Iraq and just murder everybody.
[03:04:34.420 --> 03:04:35.660]  I mean, that's what we do.
[03:04:35.660 --> 03:04:41.604]  We poison our own people, we murder everybody, and we make TV ads celebrating ourselves, saying how good we are.
[03:04:42.424 --> 03:04:43.806]  Sir, I'm going to put you on hold.
[03:04:43.806 --> 03:04:44.867]  Give me your name and info.
[03:04:44.867 --> 03:04:46.930]  I recognize your voice from the videos.
[03:04:46.930 --> 03:04:47.751]  Great job you're doing.
[03:04:47.751 --> 03:04:51.215]  We should have you on sometime from a landline about what's going on there.
[03:04:51.215 --> 03:04:59.825]  We're going to come back with Gary Franchi and William Lewis of Camp FEMA, continue talking about their film, Camp FEMA, American Lockdown, available at InfoWars.com.
[03:04:59.825 --> 03:05:00.246]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.616 --> 03:05:04.638]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.638 --> 03:05:09.962]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.962 --> 03:05:12.004]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.004 --> 03:05:17.007]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.007 --> 03:05:17.928]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.188 --> 03:05:19.309]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.309 --> 03:05:21.190]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:22.271]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.271 --> 03:05:24.472]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.472 --> 03:05:25.813]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.813 --> 03:05:27.334]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.334 --> 03:05:32.618]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.618 --> 03:05:36.200]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.200 --> 03:05:39.663]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.003 --> 03:05:41.225]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.225 --> 03:05:42.146]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.146 --> 03:05:43.247]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.247 --> 03:05:44.168]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.168 --> 03:05:45.269]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:48.313]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.313 --> 03:05:50.095]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.095 --> 03:05:51.016]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.618 --> 03:06:05.924]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:05.924 --> 03:06:10.449]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.449 --> 03:06:12.732]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.732 --> 03:06:14.354]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.354 --> 03:06:15.395]  There is a solution.

[03:07:01.226 --> 03:07:07.114]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:07:07.114 --> 03:07:12.262]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:07:12.262 --> 03:07:13.463]  That was then.
[03:07:13.463 --> 03:07:14.765]  This is now.
[03:07:14.765 --> 03:07:16.948]  Introducing Diginet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:07:17.469 --> 03:07:23.535]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:07:23.535 --> 03:07:32.765]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:07:32.765 --> 03:07:35.508]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:07:36.208 --> 03:07:40.670]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:42.191]  Video never lies.
[03:07:42.191 --> 03:07:43.852]  Watch Big Brother back.

[03:07:51.235 --> 03:07:52.896]  Diginet dot net.
[03:07:52.896 --> 03:07:53.396]  Or call 1-888-344-6681.
[03:07:53.396 --> 03:07:53.597]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:09.504]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.504 --> 03:08:12.471]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:42.531]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and we're continuing taking your phone calls with Gary Franchi and, of course, the director of the film, William Lewis Camp FEMA.
[03:08:42.531 --> 03:08:47.976]  Guys, shifting gears, they have all these different excuses to set up a police state.
[03:08:47.976 --> 03:08:49.938]  Shadowy men want to kill you overseas.
[03:08:49.938 --> 03:08:51.479]  We've got to set up homeland security.
[03:08:51.479 --> 03:08:54.322]  Then we get the documents, homeland security set up for the American people.
[03:08:55.425 --> 03:08:58.986]  Alex, you know, I just got an email here from one of your listeners.
[03:09:17.398 --> 03:09:27.920]  And he says that he was one of the early birds who pre-ordered Camfima, considering that this kind of subject matter can be difficult to present in a way that can be digested by ordinary people.
[03:09:27.920 --> 03:09:33.461]  He thought that it would be another movie that could not only show, he could only show a small percentage of his friends.
[03:09:33.461 --> 03:09:40.703]  But he says, after watching Camfima, he says, I'd like to give you both the very highest acknowledgement for making a truly great film.
[03:09:40.703 --> 03:09:42.983]  Your presentation is methodical, easy to follow.
[03:09:43.709 --> 03:09:50.992]  The historical perspective is well researched and extremely valuable in understanding how government has come to where it currently is.
[03:09:50.992 --> 03:09:53.193]  The facts are solid and irrefutable.
[03:09:53.193 --> 03:09:55.194]  I feel you have made a brilliant film.
[03:09:55.194 --> 03:09:58.655]  Talking with normal Americans about FEMA camps is a difficult thing.
[03:09:58.655 --> 03:10:02.477]  However, you presented it in a way here that people will understand.
[03:10:02.477 --> 03:10:03.957]  Thank you so much.
[03:10:03.957 --> 03:10:07.379]  I hope to be going and getting more copies soon to show to friends.
[03:10:09.298 --> 03:10:15.380]  Well, you know, that's what I made the Obama deception to do, is to shatter the left-right paradigm, to show people how both parties are controlled.
[03:10:15.380 --> 03:10:18.440]  And you do this in a matter-of-fact, like mainline television.
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:21.541]  Here's the history of FEMA, here's Congress, here's what they're doing.
[03:10:21.541 --> 03:10:28.963]  They admit the camps, because they admit it out of one side of their mouth, but in a good light, and then deny it when we say we don't want camps.
[03:10:28.963 --> 03:10:30.243]  And so you really expose that.
[03:10:30.243 --> 03:10:30.703]  Continue.
[03:10:34.082 --> 03:10:36.344]  I would say it's not an easy topic to cover.
[03:10:36.344 --> 03:10:37.364]  William, go ahead.
[03:10:37.364 --> 03:10:44.609]  Oh, I just wanted to point out that, you know, we break the film down into FEMA's three basic prime directives.
[03:10:44.609 --> 03:10:49.712]  Their directive number one is national emergency recovery, like tornadoes, floods, earthquakes.
[03:10:49.712 --> 03:10:54.436]  We go in and take a look at how they've done at those jobs in the past and give them a grade.
[03:10:54.436 --> 03:10:57.678]  And then we go in and look at their other directive, which is continuity of government.
[03:10:58.158 --> 03:11:04.602]  Protecting the country from terrorism and nuclear attacks and things of that nature that they've been doing for 30 some odd years now.
[03:11:04.602 --> 03:11:07.043]  What, you know, how have they done on that?
[03:11:07.043 --> 03:11:16.448]  And then, finally, Directive 3, which is a good portion of the documentary, which, this one is combating perceived threats to the existing social and political order.
[03:11:16.448 --> 03:11:18.369]  And, you know, we didn't just make that up.
[03:11:18.369 --> 03:11:20.170]  We didn't just pull that out of a hat.
[03:11:20.170 --> 03:11:20.810]  That phrase,
[03:11:22.441 --> 03:11:39.986]  The existing social and political order and the threat that they perceive to it is listed throughout the documentation that we found in Senate Select Committee hearings, FBI documentation, and this mimics what we see in the Department of Homeland Security report and the MIAC reports.
[03:11:39.986 --> 03:11:41.426]  So this is nothing new.
[03:11:41.426 --> 03:11:46.968]  It's just laid out in a way where people can, for the first time, put those puzzle pieces together in a way that makes sense.
[03:11:52.165 --> 03:11:56.067]  So, what do we do about the FEMA camps?
[03:11:56.067 --> 03:12:00.609]  I mean, they're just building this whole infrastructure, turning our whole society into a prison.
[03:12:00.609 --> 03:12:04.711]  It's all admitted, but they're still in denial.
[03:12:04.711 --> 03:12:07.272]  We have to resist at every corner, Matt.
[03:12:07.272 --> 03:12:10.753]  We have to resist at every corner, critical mass, spreading information.
[03:12:10.753 --> 03:12:14.255]  Alex, it's about waking up the people.
[03:12:14.255 --> 03:12:15.675]  That's the bottom line.
[03:12:15.675 --> 03:12:20.638]  You know, without an informed populace, you know, and without winning the court of public opinion, we're going to lose this battle.
[03:12:22.259 --> 03:12:27.784]  You know, I commend you, Alex, for the work you're doing, for the films you're putting out, for the message you're hitting home to people.
[03:12:27.784 --> 03:12:39.573]  You know, it's a collective effort across a spectrum of the movement, you know, to wake up the American people, to get us organized, to get us activated, and taking back this country.
[03:12:39.573 --> 03:12:46.599]  That's what we gotta do.
[03:12:46.599 --> 03:12:46.739]  Well,
[03:12:49.321 --> 03:12:59.404]  All I know is, it's clear that we have a criminal establishment in control, setting up a scientific dictatorship, and things are only going to get worse until people say no.
[03:12:59.404 --> 03:13:08.247]  The biggest issue is the worship of police, the worship of surveillance in the media, as if these are the modern heroes, greater than Michael Jordan, greater than John Wayne.
[03:13:08.247 --> 03:13:09.987]  I mean, it's really sick.
[03:13:09.987 --> 03:13:11.208]  It's predatory.
[03:13:11.208 --> 03:13:14.109]  There's all these reports of police robbing people all over the country.
[03:13:14.109 --> 03:13:14.949]  Don't even get in trouble.
[03:13:16.562 --> 03:13:23.684]  I know they're good police, but they're mainly used as the cover by the corrupt system itself to continue operating.
[03:13:23.684 --> 03:13:31.846]  Well, you know, up in Canada, there was a friend of mine who uncovered a drug smuggling operation by the Ontario Police named Scott Loper.
[03:13:31.846 --> 03:13:39.528]  You know, they threw him into a prison, they tortured him for 40 years, and never provided him access to the embassy or the State Department.
[03:13:39.528 --> 03:13:41.609]  Violated international treaty.
[03:13:41.609 --> 03:13:44.690]  So, I mean, the corruption is worldwide, Alex, and you know this.
[03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:45.070]  It's sick.
[03:13:49.755 --> 03:13:51.917]  Continue along that line.
[03:13:51.917 --> 03:13:55.439]  Well, okay, you know, Scott was a police officer.
[03:13:55.439 --> 03:14:14.474]  He investigated criminal activities in New Jersey, moved up to Canada, discovered a drug smuggling operation, his family was taken away from him, trumped up charges, his child was abducted, they still don't know where the kid is, and now he's fighting the State Department to get justice.
[03:14:14.474 --> 03:14:15.875]  The State Department's denying him.
[03:14:16.775 --> 03:14:18.819]  I mean, all the documents are there.
[03:14:18.819 --> 03:14:21.424]  Check it out at ScottLoperStory.com.
[03:14:21.424 --> 03:14:23.067]  It's a horrible thing.
[03:14:23.067 --> 03:14:27.015]  And just one man trying to get justice.
[03:14:27.015 --> 03:14:28.458]  Trying to expose corruption.
[03:14:37.386 --> 03:14:38.387]  Well, it is Alex, and
[03:15:06.460 --> 03:15:10.362]  It's up to the people, you know, to stand up to this tyranny.
[03:15:10.362 --> 03:15:27.630]  You know, when I look at my children or my grandchildren in the future, I want to say that I fought for freedom, that I fought for America, that I fought so that they could be raised and live in a world, live in an America where freedom is not a slogan, it's not a catchphrase, but it's an actual reality that we can embrace.
[03:15:28.311 --> 03:15:30.392]  And that's what I fight for every day, Alex.
[03:15:30.392 --> 03:15:37.994]  That's why we put out these films, magazines, websites, webinars, whatever it may be, to push the message forward, to organize the people.
[03:15:37.994 --> 03:15:41.095]  Because I'm not going to sit back and say I did nothing.
[03:15:41.095 --> 03:15:47.117]  I'm going to fight for this country, Alex.
[03:15:47.117 --> 03:15:48.538]  Let's take some calls here.
[03:15:48.538 --> 03:15:53.200]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Nelson in California.
[03:15:53.200 --> 03:15:54.200]  Nelson, you're on the air.
[03:15:55.202 --> 03:15:56.143]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[03:15:56.143 --> 03:15:57.463]  This is my third time calling.
[03:15:57.463 --> 03:16:00.385]  I'm from We Are Change LA.
[03:16:00.385 --> 03:16:06.909]  I was calling in regards to a previous caller who was talking about the new Michael Moore movie.
[03:16:06.909 --> 03:16:12.532]  I actually went and saw it and it was pretty bad.
[03:16:12.532 --> 03:16:13.073]  Really bad.
[03:16:13.073 --> 03:16:21.017]  But I made a spoof poster and I sent it to you through your advertising link.
[03:16:21.017 --> 03:16:23.459]  I don't know if you got it, but I made a spoof where I
[03:16:24.272 --> 03:16:29.035]  Changed Michael Moore into you, heckling Adam with your bullhorn.
[03:16:29.035 --> 03:16:38.421]  And the other thing I connected was that Michael Moore's talent agent is Rahm Emanuel's brother, Ari Emanuel.
[03:16:38.421 --> 03:16:39.942]  I don't know if you're aware of that, were you?
[03:16:41.618 --> 03:16:46.620]  Yes, but I mean, I'm not defending Michael Moore because he's anti-Second Amendment.
[03:16:46.620 --> 03:16:50.642]  He's saying corporate system, the capitalism did this.
[03:16:50.642 --> 03:16:53.483]  This is just corporate robbery that did this.
[03:16:53.483 --> 03:16:56.204]  His answer of communism is what the elites want.
[03:16:56.204 --> 03:16:58.805]  They take our wealth and give it to themselves.
[03:16:58.805 --> 03:17:02.287]  But he's one of the biggest agents in Hollywood.
[03:17:03.163 --> 03:17:05.724]  And so, yeah, you're going to have people like that involved.
[03:17:05.724 --> 03:17:08.624]  Yes, I have seen that in the news.
[03:17:08.624 --> 03:17:14.746]  And yes, he's got a whole agenda pushing government health care, seizing 20% of what's left of the market.
[03:17:14.746 --> 03:17:20.668]  Of course, the insurance companies are corrupt, too, because they've used government regulation to allow that corruption.
[03:17:20.668 --> 03:17:25.329]  Before government got involved 50 years ago, we were the apple of the world's eye.
[03:17:25.329 --> 03:17:28.470]  So, we need less government, not more government.
[03:17:31.070 --> 03:17:42.015]  And you've got Rahm Emanuel's other brother, he is advising the White House on the death panels and openly gives speeches about, you know, the case for getting rid of Granny.
[03:17:42.015 --> 03:17:43.456]  And so, yeah, it's pretty creepy.
[03:17:43.456 --> 03:17:44.516]  I appreciate your call.
[03:17:44.516 --> 03:17:50.539]  There's all these interconnections in this whole power structure, isn't there, Gary Franchi and Mr. Lewis?
[03:17:51.809 --> 03:17:52.790]  Oh, without question.
[03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:57.092]  And, you know, in the mainstream media, that's where it's so frightening.
[03:17:57.092 --> 03:18:04.255]  I just got a report that Camp FEMA was hand-delivered to Glenn Beck at a recent book signing.
[03:18:04.255 --> 03:18:10.058]  You know, and there is a special segment on Glenn Beck, as you know, Alex, in the film.
[03:18:10.058 --> 03:18:15.601]  So, we anticipate something coming out of Glenn Beck if he even decides to watch the film.
[03:18:15.601 --> 03:18:17.322]  But when the film was handed to him,
[03:18:18.126 --> 03:18:22.889]  He was told that the film was made in response to his message.
[03:18:22.889 --> 03:18:24.550]  So, should be interesting to see what the film says.
[03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:26.612]  You know what's sad about Glenn Beck?
[03:18:26.612 --> 03:18:29.354]  You know, Muse are fans of the show.
[03:18:29.354 --> 03:18:31.815]  The lead singer, main songwriter is Mr. Bellamy.
[03:18:31.815 --> 03:18:34.297]  He's been on the show.
[03:18:34.297 --> 03:18:38.320]  And, uh... We've inspired their work.
[03:18:38.320 --> 03:18:43.243]  We've inspired Megadeth and a lot of other groups.
[03:18:43.243 --> 03:18:44.224]  But the issue is...
[03:18:45.891 --> 03:18:55.137]  That Beck came out last week and endorsed it and said he loved the message and they said, remove your endorsement, you're an establishment lackey trying to co-opt our movement.
[03:18:55.137 --> 03:18:59.019]  So the good news is, anybody with half a brain knows that Beck's a phony.
[03:18:59.019 --> 03:19:06.203]  He does a lot of good work, but he only does that to get you under his control so he can then deny key issues.
[03:19:06.203 --> 03:19:10.906]  Remember, when Ron Paul had a chance of winning, it was Glenn Beck sunking, more than anybody.
[03:19:12.313 --> 03:19:17.818]  And now that Ron Paul can't become president right now, he loves him.
[03:19:17.818 --> 03:19:20.620]  He is a Judas Iscariot, he is a Benedict Arnold.
[03:19:20.620 --> 03:19:26.224]  Well, gentlemen, I want to commend you on the film, Camp FEMA, available at InfoWars.com.
[03:19:26.224 --> 03:19:28.526]  I hope everybody gets it, shows it to their friends and family.
[03:19:28.526 --> 03:19:33.770]  You can also call toll-free to get it, 888-253-3139.
[03:19:33.770 --> 03:19:37.173]  While you're calling, you can also order Fall of the Republic, that ships in
[03:19:38.154 --> 03:19:39.775]  What are we talking about?
[03:19:39.775 --> 03:19:41.456]  15 days here, or earlier.
[03:19:41.456 --> 03:19:45.798]  Comes out October 21st, 888-253-3139.
[03:19:45.798 --> 03:19:51.381]  I want to thank both of you for the great job you've done, and we'll talk to you again soon.
[03:19:51.381 --> 03:19:55.323]  Thank you, Gary Franchi and William Loos.
[03:19:55.323 --> 03:19:56.704]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:56.704 --> 03:19:58.725]  Financial news, more flu news, your phone calls.
[03:20:01.840 --> 03:20:05.926]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[03:20:05.926 --> 03:20:11.815]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[03:20:11.815 --> 03:20:12.916]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[03:20:12.916 --> 03:20:16.922]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:20:17.603 --> 03:20:30.948]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[03:20:30.948 --> 03:20:37.030]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[03:20:37.030 --> 03:20:42.852]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[03:20:43.672 --> 03:20:46.513]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:20:46.513 --> 03:20:50.134]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[03:20:50.134 --> 03:20:50.794]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:20:50.794 --> 03:20:52.655]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[03:20:52.655 --> 03:20:52.715]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:01.184 --> 03:21:03.345]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:21:03.345 --> 03:21:05.766]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:21:05.766 --> 03:21:08.347]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:21:08.347 --> 03:21:09.588]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:21:09.588 --> 03:21:11.308]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:21:11.308 --> 03:21:14.190]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:21:14.190 --> 03:21:18.312]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:21:27.456 --> 03:21:32.606]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:32.606 --> 03:21:34.730]  An inside job.
[03:21:36.121 --> 03:21:37.622]  How dare you?
[03:21:37.622 --> 03:21:43.646]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:43.646 --> 03:21:46.007]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:46.007 --> 03:21:53.011]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[03:21:53.011 --> 03:21:55.873]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:21:55.873 --> 03:21:58.114]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:21:58.114 --> 03:22:00.596]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:22:01.158 --> 03:22:04.541]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:22:04.541 --> 03:22:08.444]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:22:08.444 --> 03:22:12.167]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:22:12.167 --> 03:22:19.633]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[03:22:22.486 --> 03:22:22.766]  I think so.

[03:22:53.485 --> 03:22:56.086]  Or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:22:56.086 --> 03:23:02.651]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[03:23:02.651 --> 03:23:04.672]  Remain in your houses.
[03:23:04.672 --> 03:23:08.555]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:23:10.444 --> 03:23:11.785]  Will they do it?
[03:23:11.785 --> 03:23:14.406]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:23:14.406 --> 03:23:20.848]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:23:20.848 --> 03:23:23.069]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:23:23.069 --> 03:23:25.070]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:23:27.331 --> 03:23:32.214]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:23:32.214 --> 03:23:37.136]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:23:37.136 --> 03:23:41.939]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:23:42.859 --> 03:23:51.285]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:23:51.285 --> 03:23:53.786]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:23:53.786 --> 03:23:56.848]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:23:56.848 --> 03:24:08.956]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:24:08.956 --> 03:24:09.916]  Okay, here's the deal.
[03:24:09.916 --> 03:24:11.858]  I want to continue with your phone calls.
[03:24:16.542 --> 03:24:23.944]  More and more, I'm sitting there listening to our last guest, and I'm thinking, why are we having to even fight FEMA camps?
[03:24:23.944 --> 03:24:27.064]  Why are we even having to fight mercenaries?
[03:24:27.064 --> 03:24:31.465]  Why are we even having to deal with face scanning cameras and AP headlines?
[03:24:31.465 --> 03:24:35.446]  National police chiefs call for neighbors to spy on neighbors.
[03:24:35.446 --> 03:24:43.727]  And then I'm in Billings, Montana, and the third floor elevator opens, and it's police and Homeland Security banners with hundreds of Girl Scouts.
[03:24:44.915 --> 03:24:48.397]  And I step out of the elevator dazed.
[03:24:48.397 --> 03:24:52.179]  I mean, you know, it's so insane.
[03:24:52.179 --> 03:24:54.920]  It's so evil.
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:25:03.424]  And these crazy cops and crazy spies and crazy un-American people will go, we're stopping drugs, we're stopping terrorists.
[03:25:03.424 --> 03:25:09.207]  When you stage the terror in almost every case, when you ship the drugs in, it's all on record.
[03:25:09.207 --> 03:25:11.048]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:25:11.048 --> 03:25:12.169]  Leave me alone.
[03:25:14.451 --> 03:25:22.259]  I already don't go downtown Austin hardly ever to eat even though they got good restaurants down there because I don't want to be around the thug downtown cops.
[03:25:22.259 --> 03:25:25.543]  What am I going to do when they say now they take blood randomly at checkpoints?
[03:25:25.543 --> 03:25:29.507]  They're announcing in Canada and England they're going to randomly take breathalyzers and blood.
[03:25:29.507 --> 03:25:30.187]  Randomly!
[03:25:31.092 --> 03:25:34.313]  What do I do when the cop goes, I'm going to stick a needle in your arm, boy?
[03:25:34.313 --> 03:25:41.276]  I mean, it's just they keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing.
[03:25:41.276 --> 03:25:54.982]  And they work for offshore banks that are openly killing the dollar, that have openly doubled the credit card rates to 30%, who are openly setting up world government and are going to tax carbon dioxide.
[03:25:56.479 --> 03:25:58.000]  We've been tracking gold today.
[03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:04.545]  It's broke the all-time record by over $10 of over $1,041 today.
[03:26:04.545 --> 03:26:05.166]  $1,041 today.
[03:26:05.166 --> 03:26:08.849]  I haven't looked at it in the last hour.
[03:26:08.849 --> 03:26:11.411]  I wanted to briefly have Ted Anderson come in.
[03:26:11.411 --> 03:26:16.134]  Midas Resources, 30 years in the gold and silver business.
[03:26:16.134 --> 03:26:16.955]  Ted's had Midas for 12.
[03:26:16.955 --> 03:26:20.058]  Ted, what is going on right now?
[03:26:20.058 --> 03:26:22.259]  Well, I'm watching the market just like you are, Alex.
[03:26:22.259 --> 03:26:24.381]  I mean, the market right now is sitting at $1,040 and change.
[03:26:26.669 --> 03:26:33.172]  The sellers have tried to bring the prices down into the $1,030 range, but it keeps bouncing right back up again.
[03:26:33.172 --> 03:26:36.833]  This all started in the middle of the night while we were sleeping.
[03:26:36.833 --> 03:26:46.617]  The Arab countries decided to join in with this UN thing to bring down the United States dollar and go to a basket of currencies.
[03:26:46.617 --> 03:26:50.358]  And since then, the dollar has just been plummeting and gold has been going up.
[03:26:51.056 --> 03:26:56.937]  And we've seen a high of 1,044 now today, and it's been very strong.
[03:26:56.937 --> 03:27:02.779]  I mean, I gotta tell you, I'm really happy to see that there's a lot of people taking advantage of the offers we have right now.
[03:27:02.779 --> 03:27:05.999]  I mean, people are finally coming to their senses.
[03:27:05.999 --> 03:27:11.621]  I hate to have to motivate people by fear, because they should be using their head.
[03:27:11.621 --> 03:27:13.641]  But, you know, here's the thing.
[03:27:13.641 --> 03:27:14.902]  Here's the news story.
[03:27:14.902 --> 03:27:16.502]  The United States dollar's in trouble.
[03:27:17.279 --> 03:27:25.623]  And there's nothing really that we can do about it because we've gone so far into debt that we rely on foreign nations in order to finance our economy.
[03:27:25.623 --> 03:27:33.626]  And now we're watching the dollar fall in value because of the foreigners that have been financing this for us are deciding they don't want to have any more of it.
[03:27:33.626 --> 03:27:39.429]  They want to sell the debt that they already have, the loans that they've already given us, which means the dollar falls.
[03:27:40.009 --> 03:27:42.430]  I mean, that's just simply it, man.
[03:27:42.430 --> 03:27:48.191]  If you're sitting in the bank, if you have some money in the stock market, if you're looking at anything that has to do with U.S.
[03:27:48.191 --> 03:28:01.094]  currency, man, all I can say is you better take a real serious look at what you have, because before this is done, we could be like Argentina, where you're sitting at 40% of your value of what you had just a year ago.
[03:28:02.434 --> 03:28:14.044]  I mean, they were a nation's superpower back in the day, and then all of a sudden they went into this deficit spiral, and now their currency's almost worthless.
[03:28:14.044 --> 03:28:15.765]  And that's what the United States is doing.
[03:28:15.765 --> 03:28:17.206]  It's just identical.
[03:28:17.206 --> 03:28:18.908]  I mean, that's not the only country.
[03:28:18.908 --> 03:28:20.149]  I mean, look what Mexico did.
[03:28:20.149 --> 03:28:20.989]  Argentina.
[03:28:20.989 --> 03:28:22.390]  Brazil.
[03:28:22.390 --> 03:28:24.032]  There's Venezuela.
[03:28:24.032 --> 03:28:26.454]  There's countries in Africa, obviously.
[03:28:27.534 --> 03:28:29.977]  The world doesn't want the United States dollar anymore.
[03:28:29.977 --> 03:28:32.500]  They don't want to be dominated by the United States anymore.
[03:28:32.500 --> 03:28:34.182]  They'd like to get away from that.
[03:28:34.182 --> 03:28:38.929]  And unfortunately, us here as citizens, who have our assets tied up in U.S.
[03:28:38.929 --> 03:28:40.611]  dollar, are going to take the hit.
[03:28:43.166 --> 03:28:44.888]  Absolutely.
[03:28:44.888 --> 03:28:46.450]  Absolutely, Ted.
[03:28:46.450 --> 03:28:47.972]  Where is gold right now?
[03:28:47.972 --> 03:28:50.595]  Well, right now gold is at $1,040 and change.
[03:28:50.595 --> 03:28:52.116]  I looked at it just before I walked in.
[03:28:52.116 --> 03:28:55.260]  It was like $1,040.40.
[03:28:55.260 --> 03:28:58.624]  I can tell you right now, Alex, the stuff that I've accumulated here at that $9.80 to $9.40 level
[03:29:02.248 --> 03:29:03.609]  is going to be gone.
[03:29:03.609 --> 03:29:04.429]  And you know what?
[03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:07.111]  My prices, I'm looking at the wholesale prices to me right now.
[03:29:07.111 --> 03:29:10.353]  I have to pay a tremendous amount more for the same stuff.
[03:29:10.353 --> 03:29:11.953]  You know, I can't say it enough.
[03:29:11.953 --> 03:29:14.615]  I really want people to get into gold and silver.
[03:29:14.615 --> 03:29:20.078]  It is a big enough train wreck for everybody in the entire nation to recognize that it's coming now.
[03:29:20.078 --> 03:29:22.639]  Don't mess around with your future.
[03:29:22.639 --> 03:29:23.200]  This is it.
[03:29:23.880 --> 03:29:26.164]  We have the handwriting on the wall.
[03:29:26.164 --> 03:29:27.226]  I don't know... Absolutely!
[03:29:27.226 --> 03:29:28.107]  Let me give him the number.
[03:29:28.107 --> 03:29:28.408]  800-686-2237 800-686-2237
[03:29:36.565 --> 03:29:43.211]  Ted's running this deal up until 3 o'clock today, I guess when the show ends.
[03:29:43.211 --> 03:29:44.713]  800-686-2237.
[03:29:44.713 --> 03:29:47.455]  Do not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:47.455 --> 03:29:50.458]  In fact, we'll talk to Ted on the other side, if he can hold it a little bit longer.
[03:29:50.458 --> 03:29:51.799]  We'll find out together.
[03:29:51.799 --> 03:29:53.181]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.181 --> 03:29:54.782]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.782 --> 03:29:58.406]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.288 --> 03:30:05.510]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:07.530]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.530 --> 03:30:16.033]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:16.033 --> 03:30:21.595]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.595 --> 03:30:23.216]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.456 --> 03:30:29.962]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.962 --> 03:30:41.033]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:41.033 --> 03:30:41.793]  That's right.
[03:30:41.793 --> 03:30:44.356]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:30:44.356 --> 03:30:45.957]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[03:30:47.879 --> 03:30:48.500]  We're good to go.
[03:31:01.601 --> 03:31:03.582]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:31:03.582 --> 03:31:07.204]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:31:07.204 --> 03:31:09.545]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:31:09.545 --> 03:31:12.726]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:31:12.726 --> 03:31:18.509]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:31:18.509 --> 03:31:22.451]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[03:31:22.791 --> 03:31:27.993]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[03:31:27.993 --> 03:31:31.074]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.
[03:31:31.074 --> 03:31:38.337]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[03:31:38.337 --> 03:31:44.359]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[03:31:44.359 --> 03:31:48.901]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[03:31:49.181 --> 03:31:52.062]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[03:31:52.062 --> 03:31:54.143]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:31:54.143 --> 03:31:56.144]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[03:31:56.144 --> 03:31:58.285]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[03:31:58.285 --> 03:32:00.086]  Bring down the New World Order.
[03:32:00.086 --> 03:32:00.847]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:32:02.503 --> 03:32:07.664]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[03:32:07.664 --> 03:32:11.165]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:32:11.165 --> 03:32:16.886]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:32:16.886 --> 03:32:19.446]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:32:19.446 --> 03:32:23.987]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:32:23.987 --> 03:32:26.708]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:32:27.168 --> 03:32:32.896]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:32:32.896 --> 03:32:35.159]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:32:35.159 --> 03:32:43.710]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:32:43.710 --> 03:32:44.732]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:32:45.072 --> 03:32:49.654]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:32:49.654 --> 03:32:54.757]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:32:54.757 --> 03:32:56.518]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:32:56.518 --> 03:32:58.719]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:32:58.719 --> 03:33:00.460]  Be well and stay well.
[03:33:00.460 --> 03:33:01.140]  Best M's.
[03:33:10.344 --> 03:33:12.785]  Ted Anderson is our guest.
[03:33:12.785 --> 03:33:15.207]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[03:33:15.207 --> 03:33:19.770]  Anthony, Kurt, Scott, Shelly, Laura, and others here in just a moment.
[03:33:19.770 --> 03:33:25.293]  Also this morning, I've always meant to bring in some of my pen and ink work.
[03:33:25.293 --> 03:33:27.955]  Some of the acrylics I've done, some of the oil paintings I've painted.
[03:33:28.905 --> 03:33:31.386]  Because really, that's what I'm into.
[03:33:31.386 --> 03:33:36.529]  I mean, I'm into deep sea fishing, deep sea diving.
[03:33:36.529 --> 03:33:38.070]  I'm into camping.
[03:33:38.070 --> 03:33:40.411]  People always ask what I do, what I like.
[03:33:40.411 --> 03:33:47.614]  And when I talk about it's a weight to have to come in here and fight the New World Order, I've got other things I want to do.
[03:33:47.614 --> 03:33:58.040]  I mean, I would just rather sit out at a farmhouse somewhere and oil paint and hike and grow gardens and hang out with my children.
[03:33:59.358 --> 03:34:06.224]  And quite frankly, write poetry, things like that.
[03:34:06.224 --> 03:34:09.527]  I mean, I don't like having to fight the New World Order all day.
[03:34:09.527 --> 03:34:12.869]  I don't like having to come in here and I don't relish this.
[03:34:12.869 --> 03:34:14.731]  This is about survival.
[03:34:14.731 --> 03:34:20.236]  This is about standing up for human liberty so that we can all lead our lives the way we see fit.
[03:34:23.109 --> 03:34:38.986]  I painted a lot until I hit about 25, and I was so busy by then with the radio and TV shows that I've been doing for three, four years by then, that I quit painting, except for oil painting every once in a while, a little bit of watercolor.
[03:34:38.986 --> 03:34:40.167]  But here's one I did.
[03:34:40.167 --> 03:34:45.033]  I was looking online at Japanese
[03:34:46.380 --> 03:34:48.001]  Pen and inks.
[03:34:48.001 --> 03:34:51.364]  This is like a 400-year-old one.
[03:34:51.364 --> 03:34:52.164]  It's my own painting.
[03:34:52.164 --> 03:34:53.745]  I mean, it's a lot different than that one.
[03:34:53.745 --> 03:34:57.448]  It's not even really... It's kind of after that piece.
[03:34:57.448 --> 03:34:58.208]  I forget the name of the piece.
[03:34:58.208 --> 03:35:01.191]  This morning, I thought, why not bring a few of my smaller paintings?
[03:35:01.191 --> 03:35:03.873]  This is my own style here.
[03:35:03.873 --> 03:35:13.319]  I can certainly paint with the palette with a thin oil and a veneer and do even more... Let me have a shot from over there.
[03:35:13.319 --> 03:35:14.040]  Do even more
[03:35:15.526 --> 03:35:17.828]  Detailed work.
[03:35:17.828 --> 03:35:21.611]  But this is really the style that I developed.
[03:35:21.611 --> 03:35:25.174]  It's a thick paint.
[03:35:25.174 --> 03:35:26.295]  Almost three-dimensional.
[03:35:26.295 --> 03:35:27.396]  Well, not almost.
[03:35:27.396 --> 03:35:29.398]  It is three-dimensional.
[03:35:29.398 --> 03:35:34.162]  And so that's a rough seas with a squall, stormy skies.
[03:35:36.325 --> 03:35:38.566]  And I really like this little painting I did.
[03:35:38.566 --> 03:35:40.027]  And then here's another one.
[03:35:40.027 --> 03:35:46.350]  I took this photo when I quit painting, right around the time I quit painting when I was about 24, 25, of some sunflowers.
[03:35:46.350 --> 03:35:48.532]  My parents live on three and a half acres in town.
[03:35:48.532 --> 03:35:58.197]  They had a big sunflower grove and I cut a bunch of sunflowers and some other wildflowers and stuck them in a green vase and took a photo on my parents' table and meant to paint it.
[03:35:58.197 --> 03:35:59.918]  And that's why I started painting again about a year ago.
[03:35:59.918 --> 03:36:02.119]  I was digging through stuff and found this old photo.
[03:36:02.119 --> 03:36:03.480]  So this was the first painting I did.
[03:36:08.223 --> 03:36:18.208]  After uh... You can call it whatever style you want, but there are the oil paintings of Alex Jones.
[03:36:18.208 --> 03:36:21.929]  In fact, I'll give you a better shot over there so people can really look at it.
[03:36:21.929 --> 03:36:29.873]  But I wanted to show people that little glimpse into my mind, what I'm into, for people that are interested.
[03:36:29.873 --> 03:36:33.135]  Because, you know, I'd rather be admiring mountain vistas, I'd rather be
[03:36:34.719 --> 03:36:35.359]  Rock hunting.
[03:36:35.359 --> 03:36:36.440]  I'm a rock hound.
[03:36:36.440 --> 03:36:41.663]  My son and my older daughter are both rock pups, as they call them.
[03:36:41.663 --> 03:36:43.304]  You know, I mean, I want to go exploring.
[03:36:43.304 --> 03:36:46.505]  I want to do things.
[03:36:46.505 --> 03:36:53.089]  I mean, it's not some macho thing to go face down Storm Trooper police or mercenaries or sneak into Bohemian Grove.
[03:36:53.089 --> 03:36:54.890]  I mean, I'm really sick of it all, man.
[03:36:54.890 --> 03:36:56.430]  You know, I'm not complaining either.
[03:36:56.430 --> 03:36:57.011]  I'm just saying
[03:36:57.895 --> 03:37:01.578]  That there's a lot more to me than... I mean, I try to get up here and be calm on the air.
[03:37:01.578 --> 03:37:02.920]  I'm mad about this stuff.
[03:37:02.920 --> 03:37:05.302]  And I always paint a little painting on the back.
[03:37:05.302 --> 03:37:10.566]  Just some mindless doodle quickly.
[03:37:10.566 --> 03:37:12.708]  There's one there.
[03:37:12.708 --> 03:37:15.571]  There's a painting on the back of here.
[03:37:15.571 --> 03:37:19.394]  Signed the back all insanely.
[03:37:19.394 --> 03:37:21.636]  But I am going to try to do more of this.
[03:37:23.746 --> 03:37:26.209]  Just wanted to bring that up here.
[03:37:26.209 --> 03:37:28.591]  Two smaller paintings I did.
[03:37:28.591 --> 03:37:29.632]  Going back to Ted Anderson.
[03:37:29.632 --> 03:37:37.821]  Ted, again, you said that you're about to run out of the gold and silver you bought at the $9.90 level in the market.
[03:37:37.821 --> 03:37:40.283]  Explain to people those coins.
[03:37:40.283 --> 03:37:44.087]  You say you're going to hold it until midnight now, even if you lose money.
[03:37:44.087 --> 03:37:45.108]  That's your rodeo.
[03:37:46.659 --> 03:37:46.739]  800-686-237.
[03:37:46.739 --> 03:37:47.860]  800-686-237.
[03:37:47.860 --> 03:37:54.022]  Tell folks about the coins you've got at that price right now.
[03:37:54.022 --> 03:37:54.683]  Yeah, sure.
[03:37:54.683 --> 03:37:57.484]  I mean, the frank right now is at $233.
[03:37:57.484 --> 03:38:01.045]  For those of you who are listening, when gold was at $945, I was offering them at $236.
[03:38:01.045 --> 03:38:05.347]  So they're actually lower than they were back at that time.
[03:38:05.347 --> 03:38:07.268]  The British Sovereign currently at $288.
[03:38:07.268 --> 03:38:09.389]  They were $291.
[03:38:09.389 --> 03:38:13.210]  The Walking Liberty Halves have been holding that price at $869 for a long time.
[03:38:14.861 --> 03:38:18.143]  Just because I was able to buy a real big position.
[03:38:18.143 --> 03:38:20.885]  All I can say is that people are finally waking up.
[03:38:20.885 --> 03:38:22.406]  We're getting a lot of phone calls.
[03:38:22.406 --> 03:38:24.027]  People are buying a lot of gold.
[03:38:24.027 --> 03:38:26.288]  And I don't want to stop that.
[03:38:26.288 --> 03:38:28.450]  I mean, people need to have gold right now.
[03:38:28.450 --> 03:38:38.376]  It's like one of the few things that they can put their hands on into their possession and actually expect the fact that it'll hold value for years to come.
[03:38:38.376 --> 03:38:41.398]  And the dollar isn't going to do that for you anymore.
[03:38:41.398 --> 03:38:42.499]  Unfortunately, it's sad.
[03:38:45.327 --> 03:38:49.468]  I don't get it.
[03:38:49.468 --> 03:38:53.629]  I told guys around the office I brought some paintings in and I got the sissy comment.
[03:38:53.629 --> 03:38:58.371]  There's nothing sissy about having images in your mind of beauty.
[03:38:58.371 --> 03:39:00.692]  It's like I admire a beautiful woman.
[03:39:00.692 --> 03:39:04.313]  I mean, I tried to catch that photo of a dark
[03:39:05.515 --> 03:39:09.776]  Dark house, in the middle of the day, my parents' living room table.
[03:39:09.776 --> 03:39:13.316]  It's kind of a dark room when the shades aren't up.
[03:39:13.316 --> 03:39:27.199]  And it was on a wooden table, and the camera had a flash on it, so it illuminated, and that's kind of my surreal, or impressionistic, it's more impressionistic, representation.
[03:39:27.199 --> 03:39:31.100]  It's impressionist more than anything.
[03:39:31.100 --> 03:39:33.540]  But it's a little bit of surreal at the same time of that
[03:39:35.947 --> 03:39:36.613]  You know, 11, 12 years ago.
[03:39:38.826 --> 03:39:41.028]  And so I think it's interesting.
[03:39:41.028 --> 03:39:43.990]  And of course, the study show, it's good for your brain, too.
[03:39:43.990 --> 03:39:46.813]  But yeah, Ted, you've been in my house.
[03:39:46.813 --> 03:39:49.255]  Those oil paintings you see on the walls, I painted most of them.
[03:39:49.255 --> 03:39:50.275]  I didn't realize that.
[03:39:50.275 --> 03:39:51.436]  I didn't know they were your work.
[03:39:51.436 --> 03:39:52.737]  I mean, those were just awesome.
[03:39:52.737 --> 03:39:58.082]  I mean, every now and then you find something out about somebody and you just go, oh my God, I didn't realize that.
[03:39:58.082 --> 03:39:59.163]  And here I've been to your house.
[03:39:59.163 --> 03:40:06.349]  We had a really great time at that Willie Nelson concert out in the, it was the concert in the, what do they call it, the park or whatever they,
[03:40:07.449 --> 03:40:12.353]  And to meet your family and just to know more.
[03:40:12.353 --> 03:40:16.076]  Sometimes you have a picture in your mind and I think that's just great.
[03:40:16.076 --> 03:40:24.803]  Anyways, getting back to the gold, Alex, all I can say is that I know, unless if gold drops down in the $900 level again, I don't think it's going to.
[03:40:25.923 --> 03:40:28.224]  I'm not going to be able to come up with these prices anymore.
[03:40:28.224 --> 03:40:29.904]  The prices are going to go up.
[03:40:29.904 --> 03:40:30.525]  I can't hold.
[03:40:30.525 --> 03:40:43.969]  I'm not a miracle worker here, but I will take any deal up to midnight at these prices, and I would suggest that you get a move on it if you're thinking about it at all, because this is the time to be doing it.
[03:40:43.969 --> 03:40:50.150]  When you see the United Nations and these major countries, I mean, these are the countries that finance the United States.
[03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:51.691]  We quite literally had
[03:40:52.071 --> 03:41:08.101]  The prosperity we had here in the United States between the year 1980 and the year 2006 about, because of the fact that they were able to lend us their prosperity and we didn't have to suffer the consequences of inflating a currency.
[03:41:08.101 --> 03:41:18.187]  But now we're sitting here with even a much greater need for money to be lent to us, a much larger volume of more ferocious appetite for debt.
[03:41:19.088 --> 03:41:20.770]  Because we're solving all of our problems.
[03:41:20.770 --> 03:41:23.913]  We're not going to go into a health care thing.
[03:41:23.913 --> 03:41:25.155]  The carbon taxes.
[03:41:25.155 --> 03:41:28.699]  I mean this whole thing is just getting way out of hand.
[03:41:28.699 --> 03:41:32.363]  And the foreigners are saying, sorry, we're no longer going to be your creditor.
[03:41:32.363 --> 03:41:33.324]  We're cutting you off.
[03:41:33.324 --> 03:41:37.149]  And that leaves the United States government to sell its U.S.
[03:41:37.149 --> 03:41:38.170]  government securities
[03:41:38.530 --> 03:41:39.110]  We're good to go.
[03:42:08.650 --> 03:42:10.491]  And now we're at the end of the rope.
[03:42:10.491 --> 03:42:11.472]  This is it.
[03:42:11.472 --> 03:42:12.793]  The game is over.
[03:42:12.793 --> 03:42:14.213]  People are realizing it.
[03:42:14.213 --> 03:42:16.815]  My phones are ringing, thank God.
[03:42:16.815 --> 03:42:17.996]  People are getting out of paper.
[03:42:17.996 --> 03:42:19.036]  They're going into gold.
[03:42:19.036 --> 03:42:22.718]  I just can't think of a better thing to do for people than that.
[03:42:22.718 --> 03:42:24.559]  And I just need to say it, Alex.
[03:42:24.559 --> 03:42:25.440]  People need to do it.
[03:42:26.152 --> 03:42:32.043]  It isn't a question of as to whether or not I think I should buy some gold and silver and how much and yadda yadda yadda.
[03:42:32.043 --> 03:42:38.955]  Hey, keep as much as you want in paper currency, just expect the fact that you're going to buy an awful lot less with that in a very short period of time.
[03:42:39.847 --> 03:42:43.232]  I don't mean to predict the future, but that's just where we're going.
[03:42:43.232 --> 03:42:43.812]  Absolutely.
[03:42:43.812 --> 03:42:44.073]  800-686-2237.
[03:42:44.073 --> 03:42:50.101]  And again, your purchase also makes this radio show possible.
[03:42:50.101 --> 03:42:51.323]  Can't beat these deals.
[03:42:51.323 --> 03:42:53.406]  It goes till midnight tonight, Central Standard Time.
[03:42:53.406 --> 03:42:55.228]  Thank you so much, Dan Anderson.
[03:42:55.228 --> 03:42:56.310]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[03:42:57.076 --> 03:42:59.338]  You bet, good to have you here with us.
[03:42:59.338 --> 03:43:01.760]  Alright, I said I was going to take some calls.
[03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:03.862]  I'm really upset about what's happening with the dollar.
[03:43:03.862 --> 03:43:10.248]  I'm upset about the flu, that it's a live flu virus they're putting in the nasal spray and they admit it's spreading it.
[03:43:10.248 --> 03:43:11.490]  How dumb do they think we are?
[03:43:11.490 --> 03:43:15.413]  They'd spread it in front of everyone as the cure and then it'll be a big pandemic.
[03:43:15.413 --> 03:43:19.477]  I mean, these people are, they're bold.
[03:43:19.477 --> 03:43:20.438]  Con artists are bold.
[03:43:24.013 --> 03:43:28.757]  These aren't just con artists, these are eugenicists, control freaks that want to ruin our lives.
[03:43:28.757 --> 03:43:31.019]  They're predators.
[03:43:31.019 --> 03:43:34.702]  And at a very base level, I get threatened by people that attack me.
[03:43:34.702 --> 03:43:39.626]  People that attack me mentally, financially, liberty-wise, governmental.
[03:43:39.626 --> 03:43:41.748]  I mean, I can't help it.
[03:43:41.748 --> 03:43:45.812]  Somebody messes with me, I immediately start disliking them.
[03:43:46.493 --> 03:43:48.835]  I'm sick of your crap, government, and all the corrupt scum that surrounds you.
[03:43:48.835 --> 03:43:49.996]  I've been trying to be calm all day.
[03:43:49.996 --> 03:43:50.216]  I am pissed!
[03:44:06.003 --> 03:44:07.644]  I just can't handle it anymore, man.
[03:44:07.644 --> 03:44:09.025]  I'm sick of it!
[03:44:09.025 --> 03:44:10.806]  I want government off my back!
[03:44:10.806 --> 03:44:16.850]  I want all the corrupt scum that's lazy and stupid, so you go join government to suck off of us, to get out of my life!
[03:44:16.850 --> 03:44:17.870]  I don't belong to you!
[03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:33.901]  And I'm sick of ill-informed morons trying to tell me how things work, or tell me what's going on, and how Obama's good, or Bush is good, or some jackass Democratic operative trying to mess with me right now.
[03:44:35.708 --> 03:44:38.210]  That I'm gonna have to stomp Flattered in a Pancake legally?
[03:44:38.210 --> 03:44:42.254]  I mean, I just get sick of all the crud that goes on around here behind the scenes.
[03:44:43.120 --> 03:44:53.828]  And all the stupid scum that don't understand that I'm on their team, that I want them to do well, that I know they're under eugenics, that they just buy into the fake paradigm and they run with it.
[03:44:53.828 --> 03:44:56.449]  And they have no connection to reality.
[03:44:56.449 --> 03:45:02.474]  All you stupid Obama supporters, all you stupid Bush supporters, they're all owned by the same people.
[03:45:02.474 --> 03:45:06.336]  And I know our audience knows that, but I'm talking to the new idiots tuning in.
[03:45:06.336 --> 03:45:08.158]  Listen, it's fundamental.
[03:45:08.158 --> 03:45:09.879]  What is so hard to explain to you?
[03:45:11.724 --> 03:45:14.705]  It's fundamental they're killing the dollar.
[03:45:14.705 --> 03:45:16.806]  Printing tens of trillions of it.
[03:45:16.806 --> 03:45:19.207]  It's fundamental it's gonna plunge in value.
[03:45:19.207 --> 03:45:21.787]  It's fundamental gold's gonna go up.
[03:45:21.787 --> 03:45:24.708]  It's fundamental!
[03:45:24.708 --> 03:45:29.390]  It isn't hard to figure out!
[03:45:29.390 --> 03:45:33.111]  Who's up next here?
[03:45:33.111 --> 03:45:34.672]  Anthony in New York, you're on the air.
[03:45:34.672 --> 03:45:35.352]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[03:45:37.219 --> 03:45:38.179]  Hey, buddy.
[03:45:38.179 --> 03:45:39.320]  How you doing?
[03:45:39.320 --> 03:45:40.700]  I'm not doing too good.
[03:45:40.700 --> 03:45:43.901]  God bless you for the job you do.
[03:45:43.901 --> 03:45:45.101]  Well, I mean, why?
[03:45:45.101 --> 03:45:46.362]  I've got to fight these people.
[03:45:46.362 --> 03:45:47.782]  I mean, I would be a moron.
[03:45:47.782 --> 03:45:51.483]  I would not have the instinct of self-preservation if I didn't fight these people.
[03:45:51.483 --> 03:45:52.243]  Well, of course.
[03:45:52.243 --> 03:45:53.364]  But God bless you anyway.
[03:45:53.364 --> 03:45:58.205]  And I'm a stockbroker from New York, and I couldn't agree with you and Ted more about gold.
[03:45:58.205 --> 03:46:02.846]  And if Peter Schiff inspired, I couldn't agree with him more about the foreign stocks.
[03:46:02.846 --> 03:46:05.767]  And if you look at the way the Swiss franc behaved during some of the
[03:46:06.834 --> 03:46:07.995]  They're total operatives, you know.
[03:46:31.596 --> 03:46:35.178]  But they call your name and you stand up and then they ask the question for you.
[03:46:35.178 --> 03:46:38.141]  So I stood up and he has his cronies with him.
[03:46:38.141 --> 03:46:43.424]  He has his lawyer and a doctor and some other crony answering half the questions for him.
[03:46:43.424 --> 03:46:50.969]  So the lawyer goes to answer my question and I stood up and I shouted right in his face and I said, I want you to answer.
[03:46:50.969 --> 03:46:54.972]  And some people in the crowd told me to sit down and I said, no, I want him to answer.
[03:46:54.972 --> 03:46:57.774]  And the local paper Newsday took my picture.
[03:46:57.774 --> 03:46:58.915]  I'm in the paper.
[03:46:58.915 --> 03:47:00.156]  I'm on the, uh,
[03:47:00.802 --> 03:47:03.964]  Newsday.com website.
[03:47:03.964 --> 03:47:05.485]  And I want to run up against this guy.
[03:47:05.485 --> 03:47:07.967]  He's an independent.
[03:47:07.967 --> 03:47:11.690]  And of course he's pushing the government takeover of healthcare?
[03:47:11.690 --> 03:47:12.230]  Yes.
[03:47:12.230 --> 03:47:13.471]  Yes.
[03:47:13.471 --> 03:47:15.212]  And I want to run against him as an independent.
[03:47:15.212 --> 03:47:16.333]  I think I could do it.
[03:47:16.333 --> 03:47:28.302]  And I think we need guys like me and Peter Schiff in there that understand if we don't get our financial house in order, all the rest of the debate and all the rest of the issues, you know, there's nothing left if there's no currency.
[03:47:30.996 --> 03:47:38.243]  And we all know that saying, you know, control a nation's currency, and I care not who makes a floss.
[03:47:38.243 --> 03:47:39.484]  Good points, my friend.
[03:47:39.484 --> 03:47:41.906]  I appreciate you calling, Anthony from New York.
[03:47:41.906 --> 03:47:43.128]  Good to hear from you.
[03:47:43.128 --> 03:47:45.490]  Kurt in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:47:45.490 --> 03:47:45.950]  Hi.
[03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:47.292]  Yes, sir.
[03:47:47.292 --> 03:47:56.040]  I've heard you talk some time about the tracking cars to tax them for the miles that they drive.
[03:47:57.034 --> 03:47:57.894]  Yes.
[03:47:57.894 --> 03:48:15.238]  About two weeks ago, I tried to apply for insurance with a certain company here, and after we talked about the policy on the car, the fellow said, uh, we have a new program, uh, said, do you drive your car very much?
[03:48:15.238 --> 03:48:18.898]  And I said, no, I don't, uh, just back to the store and back.
[03:48:18.898 --> 03:48:19.639]  I'm retired.
[03:48:19.639 --> 03:48:24.100]  And, uh, he said, well, we have a new program.
[03:48:24.100 --> 03:48:26.120]  Uh, if we can put this, uh,
[03:48:26.730 --> 03:48:36.456]  Little device in the car that will tell us where you're going and how many miles you traveled during the day.
[03:48:36.456 --> 03:48:39.238]  We can offer you a 10% discount.
[03:48:39.238 --> 03:48:40.419]  Now is it progressive?
[03:48:41.260 --> 03:48:42.621]  Yes it is.
[03:48:42.621 --> 03:48:44.802]  Yeah, see they lied to you.
[03:48:44.802 --> 03:48:53.787]  They're getting money, thousands of dollars depending on the federal study, to put a satellite by the mile tracker in your car to test it.
[03:48:53.787 --> 03:48:56.168]  Texas is the main testing ground.
[03:48:56.168 --> 03:49:00.211]  Do you happen to be in Austin or surrounding areas?
[03:49:00.211 --> 03:49:01.111]  No.
[03:49:01.111 --> 03:49:03.212]  West Texas, Abilene.
[03:49:03.212 --> 03:49:05.954]  But you didn't mention Progressive to me, right?
[03:49:07.716 --> 03:49:08.637]  You did.
[03:49:08.637 --> 03:49:13.778]  Yeah, yeah, I wanted to make sure, because I'm... Yeah, no, no, Progressive's the one doing that.
[03:49:13.778 --> 03:49:18.800]  Some others are doing it, and they admit, in the federal program, they're getting ready to tax this by the mile.
[03:49:18.800 --> 03:49:24.042]  In fact, you can Google, Austin test by the mile tax.
[03:49:24.042 --> 03:49:26.563]  And they're going to keep the oil tax, too.
[03:49:26.563 --> 03:49:29.343]  Oil tax revenues are at all-time highs, but they lie and say they're not.
[03:49:29.343 --> 03:49:33.545]  They're going to... But Progressive already...
[03:49:35.180 --> 03:49:35.740]  I think?
[03:49:56.045 --> 03:49:59.928]  And very, very new world order, just like Microsoft and IBM.
[03:49:59.928 --> 03:50:02.029]  And so I would just get away from progressive.
[03:50:02.029 --> 03:50:11.015]  They're trying to make the whole industry shift where you've got to have government health care, $3,000 to $5,000 a year fines.
[03:50:11.015 --> 03:50:13.417]  You're going to have to have expanded auto coverage.
[03:50:13.417 --> 03:50:15.678]  You're going to have to have other coverage.
[03:50:15.678 --> 03:50:20.442]  And then this is the nanny state where, oh, well, if you accept a chip or a tracker bracelet,
[03:50:21.062 --> 03:50:24.986]  I don't know if it was truly true or not, but a friend of mine said up at the Dallas Fair this year
[03:50:43.064 --> 03:50:47.607]  They were putting a bracelet on the children when they came in?
[03:51:01.889 --> 03:51:03.810]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[03:51:03.810 --> 03:51:08.972]  You might have the food, water, gold, and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?
[03:51:08.972 --> 03:51:11.813]  That's why you need to visit MaineMilitary.com.
[03:51:11.813 --> 03:51:14.334]  MaineMilitary.com carries everything you need.

[03:52:01.463 --> 03:52:07.507]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.507 --> 03:52:13.391]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:13.391 --> 03:52:19.535]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:19.875 --> 03:52:21.836]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:21.836 --> 03:52:24.318]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:24.318 --> 03:52:37.506]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:37.506 --> 03:52:39.167]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.167 --> 03:52:41.028]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.028 --> 03:52:47.272]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.007 --> 03:52:53.372]  If you're tired of paying too much for gas, diesel, or heating oil, Future Fuel Technologies has the answer you're looking for.
[03:52:53.372 --> 03:52:55.033]  It's called FFT Fuel Saver.
[03:52:55.033 --> 03:53:01.639]  FFT Fuel Saver is made using a patented formula that helps fuel burn cleaner.
[03:53:26.766 --> 03:53:27.386]  We're good to go!
[03:53:54.445 --> 03:53:54.945]  Call 1-888-961-6600.
[03:53:54.945 --> 03:53:55.106]  FFT.
[03:53:55.106 --> 03:53:56.607]  Simply the best fuel saver on Earth.
[03:54:26.152 --> 03:54:30.756]  All right, I want to jam in Scott, the UK, Shelly and Laura if we have time.
[03:54:30.756 --> 03:54:35.660]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's show possible as well.
[03:54:35.660 --> 03:54:38.503]  They're great sponsors and they again fund everything we're doing here.
[03:54:38.503 --> 03:54:42.266]  AcolaBlue.com, the atmospheric water generator for your home or office.
[03:54:42.266 --> 03:54:45.309]  Grabs up to seven and a half gallons of water out of the air a day.
[03:54:45.309 --> 03:54:47.731]  Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on the top.
[03:54:48.684 --> 03:54:48.984]  I don't
[03:55:08.641 --> 03:55:13.264]  Hidden sunglasses that have a great little digital chip that record video and audio.
[03:55:13.264 --> 03:55:14.785]  Pins.
[03:55:14.785 --> 03:55:15.966]  The lowest prices.
[03:55:15.966 --> 03:55:17.067]  Big seller.
[03:55:17.067 --> 03:55:18.148]  Diginet.net.
[03:55:18.148 --> 03:55:18.688]  Give them a call.
[03:55:18.688 --> 03:55:18.748]  888-344-6681.
[03:55:18.748 --> 03:55:18.808]  888-344-6681.
[03:55:18.808 --> 03:55:19.328]  Diginet.net.
[03:55:19.328 --> 03:55:20.049]  Great for court.
[03:55:20.049 --> 03:55:21.010]  Great to have with the police.
[03:55:21.010 --> 03:55:22.070]  Great to have at work.
[03:55:22.070 --> 03:55:22.911]  You know, anytime.
[03:55:32.257 --> 03:55:42.404]  You know, let's say you're a salesman or something going into dangerous neighborhoods, and a dog comes up and is about to bite you, you want to record it before you kick it in the head, or you know, if you work in dangerous areas, whatever.
[03:55:42.404 --> 03:55:46.046]  The point is it's good to have this, because people will say the dog did nothing to you.
[03:55:46.046 --> 03:55:47.167]  You know, that stuff works.
[03:55:47.167 --> 03:55:49.849]  Diginet.net, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55:49.849 --> 03:55:51.670]  Let's jam in some calls quickly.
[03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:53.331]  Scott in the UK, then Shelly and Laura.
[03:55:53.331 --> 03:55:55.192]  Go ahead, Scott.
[03:55:55.192 --> 03:55:56.553]  Hello, Alex.
[03:55:56.553 --> 03:55:57.794]  Well done.
[03:55:57.794 --> 03:55:58.434]  You're doing good.
[03:56:01.357 --> 03:56:09.179]  Just calling up about the whole gold and dollar issue that just seemed to appear today.
[03:56:09.179 --> 03:56:21.422]  It's really made me wonder why is gold now such a thing to aim for and why has the American dollar just been made to plummet?
[03:56:21.422 --> 03:56:23.302]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[03:56:23.302 --> 03:56:26.063]  And one thing with the American dollar being the
[03:56:26.887 --> 03:56:33.352]  The world currency, does it actually matter what currency we're using as a world currency?
[03:56:33.352 --> 03:56:39.517]  Isn't the actual concept of using a currency corrupt in itself?
[03:56:39.517 --> 03:56:44.240]  Well, that's a huge question and huge issue, and I don't claim to have all the answers.
[03:56:44.240 --> 03:56:49.884]  But gold is an intrinsic industrial metal used in thousands and thousands of different industries.
[03:56:49.884 --> 03:56:51.986]  Gold is the oldest form of money.
[03:56:51.986 --> 03:56:52.766]  It's finite.
[03:56:52.766 --> 03:56:55.268]  It's truly precious.
[03:56:55.268 --> 03:56:55.829]  It's scarce.
[03:56:57.008 --> 03:56:57.388]  I don't know.
[03:57:15.411 --> 03:57:19.896]  You can always get gold back, can't you, in its form as gold.
[03:57:19.896 --> 03:57:22.899]  I'm going to let you go because we're almost out of time.
[03:57:22.899 --> 03:57:24.000]  Thank you for the call.
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:27.644]  You can call me back tomorrow if you wish to discuss this more.
[03:57:27.644 --> 03:57:36.333]  The human population is six and a half billion and growing, and so the gold is in a lot of things, but people don't strip the gold out of a microchip generally when it goes to the landfill.
[03:57:37.504 --> 03:57:45.712]  So hell, I mean if people want stocks and bonds or people want paper money over gold, get into it.
[03:57:45.712 --> 03:57:53.599]  It's just oil and other commodities like gold and things and timber and real estate, things that have some intrinsic value.
[03:57:54.605 --> 03:58:01.671]  They are going to have more value during inflation and during currency devaluations.
[03:58:01.671 --> 03:58:06.815]  So gold is up because the bankers have issued tens of trillions of U.S.
[03:58:06.815 --> 03:58:08.496]  currency to the world.
[03:58:08.496 --> 03:58:10.558]  And it's just backed up by nothing.
[03:58:10.558 --> 03:58:13.440]  And so people rightfully are suspicious of it.
[03:58:13.440 --> 03:58:14.942]  I'm sorry to Shelly and Laura.
[03:58:14.942 --> 03:58:16.963]  Call me back tomorrow to go to the head of the line.
[03:58:20.188 --> 03:58:27.730]  Gold is up, not because gold is up, but because the dollar is being devalued by overprinting and over issuance.
[03:58:27.730 --> 03:58:33.672]  And what matters about a global currency is who controls the currency, because they can use it to destroy your nation.
[03:58:33.672 --> 03:58:37.794]  Read what Thomas Jefferson had to say, or Benjamin Franklin.
[03:58:37.794 --> 03:58:38.714]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:38.714 --> 03:58:40.434]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:40.434 --> 03:58:43.755]  InfoWars.com.

[03:58:58.248 --> 03:59:02.811]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.811 --> 03:59:08.415]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.

[03:59:13.459 --> 03:59:17.081]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.081 --> 03:59:21.905]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.905 --> 03:59:28.469]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.

[03:59:30.911 --> 03:59:34.112]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
