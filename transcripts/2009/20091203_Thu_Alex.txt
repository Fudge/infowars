[00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.313]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:09.794]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:11.515]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:15.778]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:20.381]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.432]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:32.435]  We have reached the waypoint, halfway into this four-hour radio transmission.
[00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:36.438]  We're here live, Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:36.958]  Eastern.
[00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:43.543]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:49.928]  And coming up after the break, we are going to talk to five different groups.
[00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:51.080]  I don't know.
[00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:04.467]  Woke up watching my police state films.
[00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.228]  Another example of how you don't know who you're waking up.
[00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:13.850]  You don't know who's watching your films or reading your blog or who you're awakening and what they will go on to do.
[00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.172]  And Luke started a group called We Are Change that decided to go out and confront David Rockefeller and Bill Clinton and George Bush.
[00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:24.594]  And count Zbigniew Brzezinski and countless others.
[00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:25.475]  And they got arrested.
[00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:26.576]  They got attacked.
[00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:27.377]  They got beat up.
[00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:28.938]  They got vindicated.
[00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.181]  They got international attention.
[00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:40.969]  Other groups, other organizations have picked up on it to the point of now you see the people going to Republican and Democrat.
[00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:51.797]  Meet and greets, speeches, public events, and shouting down both parties saying, we want the Federal Reserve abolished, we don't want world government, we don't want a new world order.
[00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:54.499]  And it's been non-partisan.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.725]  And the Tea Parties grew out of 9-11 Truth, out of We Are Change, out of other groups that pioneered
[00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:17.354]  The system that I originally pioneered unknowingly of going out and going to press conferences and asking real questions and then they freak out and grab you and drag you out and then that is what's all over the newspapers because it was a big event.
[00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:28.318]  I mean, I didn't know 14 years ago, 10 years ago, I started figuring it out after that, that when I would go to an event, ask Janet Reno about
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.865]  The House investigation concluding Delta Force was there shooting American citizens at Waco.
[00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:37.988]  That would be the headline in the Associated Press.
[00:02:38.488 --> 00:02:40.550]  Because I would simply go ask real questions.
[00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:43.613]  Or I'd ask Governor George Bush a question and be arrested.
[00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:46.456]  And it would be all over Texas newspapers and TV.
[00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:48.738]  And people would say, what did Mr. Jones say?
[00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:49.899]  Why was he arrested?
[00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:59.240]  Governor, you say you want to help Texas, but you're part of the Council on Foreign Relations that openly wants to end America and set up a New World Order.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.442]  And isn't it the Federal Reserve that's destroying America and de-industrializing us?
[00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:10.425]  And then suddenly I get arrested, not intending to, and the media says, why did he get arrested for free speech?
[00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:11.785]  He asked the question politely.
[00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:13.586]  And what did he have to say?
[00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:16.868]  And then there I was on TV and radio and in newsprint.
[00:03:19.508 --> 00:03:25.292]  I mean, you know, the big left-controlled, fake Ford Foundation demonstrations don't do much.
[00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:41.884]  But thousands of little groups going to press conferences and going to events where governors and politicians and city council people, you name it, big and small, you go, you ask real questions, and you take over the whole event.
[00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:46.448]  Because they're so criminal, they're so aware of what they're doing, they're going to flip out.
[00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:50.609]  I mean, 12 years ago, you went to a public event and talked about a new world order.
[00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.070]  I used to go down to the county commissioners and this ended up on TV locally.
[00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.211]  Many of you saw it on Austin TV.
[00:03:56.811 --> 00:03:59.692]  And SWAT teams would come in and start grabbing me.
[00:04:01.372 --> 00:04:02.953]  And people would say, why are you grabbing him?
[00:04:02.973 --> 00:04:04.473]  He gets his three minutes of communication.
[00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:07.914]  And they'd say, you're not allowed to get up there and talk about a new world order.
[00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:15.239]  The Travis County Commissioner's Court's trying to ban t-shirts with political messages on them.
[00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:16.519]  They're going to get sued.
[00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:17.400]  They're going to lose that.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.640]  They're showing us how they're tyrants.
[00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.241]  And that's what We Are Change has been doing.
[00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:25.142]  And now everybody's mimicking what they're doing.
[00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:30.643]  See, I wake people up, they go out and wake up even more people, and those people wake up even more.
[00:04:31.023 --> 00:04:34.384]  You understand how these dominoes fall?
[00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:40.917]  And this is one of the major Achilles heels of the New World Order.
[00:04:41.918 --> 00:04:52.886]  Everywhere Al Gore goes now, Tea Party groups, We Are Change, and others are going in and taking over the media event and exposing Al Gore for what he is.
[00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:55.508]  So he just can't be there spewing his fraud.
[00:04:55.908 --> 00:04:57.690]  People are there calling him on it.
[00:04:59.093 --> 00:05:01.995]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:05:02.475 --> 00:05:05.636]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:10.459]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:16.262]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:21.045]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:24.367]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:05:24.947 --> 00:05:29.350]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.993]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:38.195]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:41.497]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.

[00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:49.642]  Don't wait, call today!
[00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.292]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:07.657]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:08.018 --> 00:06:09.759]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.884]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:15.064 --> 00:06:16.025]  How much do you want?
[00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:17.006]  When do you want it?
[00:06:17.386 --> 00:06:18.988]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:20.089]  When will you need it?
[00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.391]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:23.652]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:25.213]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:25.414 --> 00:06:25.774]  If there's a
[00:06:25.814 --> 00:06:27.777]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:06:27.937 --> 00:06:30.461]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:33.865]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:34.246 --> 00:06:37.751]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:38.071 --> 00:06:39.053]  How much will you need?
[00:06:39.313 --> 00:06:39.914]  We don't know.
[00:06:40.194 --> 00:06:41.115]  How much do you want?
[00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:42.037]  All you can get.
[00:06:42.057 --> 00:06:42.918]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.018 --> 00:06:43.378]  I think.
[00:06:58.672 --> 00:07:03.839]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.922]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.325]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:10.348]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:07:10.788 --> 00:07:12.150]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.452]  There is a solution.
[00:07:13.672 --> 00:07:21.681]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:29.168]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:35.215]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:07:35.575 --> 00:07:41.181]  I love their Nutri Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:45.405]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:04.726]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:07.407]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.988 --> 00:08:19.990]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I talk about the fact that the climate gate
[00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:26.366]  Emails and computer programs show clear fraud and people are now resigning.
[00:08:26.846 --> 00:08:28.867]  The Australian Parliament is falling apart.
[00:08:29.187 --> 00:08:37.971]  Their climate gate legislation, their climate legislation, their takeover legislation, their tax legislation, their neo-feudalism legislation just fell through in Australia.
[00:08:38.432 --> 00:08:40.233]  There's investigations of all these people.
[00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:46.716]  More whistleblowers are coming out by the minute from universities saying they were ordered to engage in fraud and they're resigning.
[00:08:47.887 --> 00:08:56.519]  I mean, this is a criminal group of collectivists working for big foundations and banks that want a scientific dictatorship.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.164]  We have John P.
[00:09:03.183 --> 00:09:07.145]  Holdren being grilled now about his involvement in Climategate.
[00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:12.747]  We have Al Gore saying he's not going to Copenhagen now, and is going to cancel his lecture.
[00:09:13.627 --> 00:09:14.308]  And you know why?
[00:09:14.368 --> 00:09:17.889]  Because they don't want to give Lord Monckton, who'll be outside media attention.
[00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:24.012]  Because they know people are going to be inside his lecture, if it's open to anyone, who are going to stand up and shout him down.
[00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:27.033]  I told you that everywhere, everywhere he's going.
[00:09:27.613 --> 00:09:28.593]  And who pioneered this?
[00:09:28.713 --> 00:09:29.334]  We are change.
[00:09:30.355 --> 00:09:37.014]  And the real Tea Parties, not the compromised groups that have been taken over by the Republicans so they can control them.
[00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:40.992]  Are shutting these people down because they can't have a real debate.
[00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:45.012]  Al Gore will never debate anyone that questioned man-made climate change.
[00:09:45.393 --> 00:09:46.713]  Notice it's not warming anymore.
[00:09:47.073 --> 00:09:50.254]  Now that that's been proven it's getting colder now, now it's change.
[00:09:51.714 --> 00:09:53.034]  Cycles can't change.
[00:09:53.074 --> 00:09:54.054]  They're unnatural.
[00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:55.755]  Seasons are unnatural.
[00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.395]  Polar bears can't swim.
[00:09:57.935 --> 00:09:58.735]  All these lies.
[00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:03.676]  His lie about carbon dioxide going up with temperature when it actually follows hundreds of years after.
[00:10:04.157 --> 00:10:05.857]  These are all base frauds.
[00:10:07.657 --> 00:10:10.420]  But here it is up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.100]  Huge news.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.584]  Gore cancels on Copenhagen lecture, leaves ticket holders in a lurch.
[00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:18.947]  It seems the uncertainty about Copenhagen is growing.
[00:10:19.448 --> 00:10:22.831]  When Al Gore pulls the plug, you know it's over.
[00:10:23.953 --> 00:10:24.594]  Here's another one.
[00:10:24.834 --> 00:10:30.298]  Holdren grilled over email controversy from the National Journal up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:38.545]  In a hearing that was part sparring match and part high school science lesson, two of Obama administration's climate change experts, John Holdren
[00:10:39.687 --> 00:10:45.792]  Testify the day before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming about the validity of man-made climate change.
[00:10:45.812 --> 00:11:01.126]  From the start, Republicans focused on the conversation of the controversial hacked emails from East Anglia University's Climate Research Unit in England, in which a number of scientists made remarks about limiting the dissemination of work by climate change skeptics.
[00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.968]  Yeah, blocking them and persecuting them, and how to fix the data.
[00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:05.309]  The research center
[00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.834]  That provides data for much of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's conclusions.
[00:11:09.854 --> 00:11:10.935]  See, this is the head group.
[00:11:11.175 --> 00:11:13.857]  The media's like, oh, it's just some backwater university, no big deal.
[00:11:13.998 --> 00:11:14.898]  No, this is the head group.
[00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:17.461]  See, they even lie about that, and people are catching them in this.
[00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:22.666]  Holdren, director of the White House Office on Science and Technology, who wrote EcoScience,
[00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:30.040]  This book right here calling for drugging the water to sterilize you and how to exterminate the population.
[00:11:30.521 --> 00:11:31.701]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:11:32.522 --> 00:11:33.162]  Got grilled.
[00:11:33.643 --> 00:11:35.184]  I'm gonna play some of that next hour.
[00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:37.445]  I mean, this is getting just to be incredible.
[00:11:38.005 --> 00:11:41.868]  Also, Bernanke may have his confirmation held up as he's being grilled.
[00:11:41.888 --> 00:11:44.049]  That's coming up next hour when we cover the economy.
[00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.531]  But I gotta move quick now.
[00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:50.559]  We are simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:12:02.098]  I want to move quick because we've got five different groups of We Are Change on, and they're going to be joining us one after the other, and I want to have time to play some of the video clips and audio clips here.
[00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:08.578]  For you that they've shot and We're gonna save the best for last Chicago.
[00:12:08.618 --> 00:12:09.298]  We are changed.
[00:12:09.558 --> 00:12:25.482]  This is how it's done now standing up is how it's done I'm no armchair quarterback people on the front lines Just standing up and speaking out against him in front of hundreds of people and in front of TV cameras takes incredible courage I'm just saying you want to see a textbook for how it's done you watch the Chicago video
[00:12:26.653 --> 00:12:30.298]  But we're going to start with Nathan from We Are Change Rhode Island.
[00:12:44.158 --> 00:12:46.579]  Because genocide is apparently funny to these people.
[00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.301]  And of course, this conversation happened before Climategate.
[00:12:49.581 --> 00:12:50.762]  Now it's all about Climategate.
[00:12:50.782 --> 00:12:53.283]  Then we've got Matt from We Are Change Nashville.
[00:12:53.764 --> 00:12:57.126]  That took over the TV and news headlines when they went out and just questioned him.
[00:12:57.146 --> 00:12:59.607]  See, we're taking over all his media.
[00:12:59.887 --> 00:13:00.808]  So it's backfiring.
[00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:03.069]  Now every time he speaks, it's all about Climategate.
[00:13:03.609 --> 00:13:05.951]  But if no one was there, he could have it one way.
[00:13:07.311 --> 00:13:08.392]  Oh man, this is beautiful.
[00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:09.393]  I mean, this is victory.
[00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:13.375]  This is fighting in the trenches, ground pounders, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:15.404 --> 00:13:18.805]  Dan from We Are Change Toronto confronted Gore.
[00:13:19.926 --> 00:13:21.546]  We Are Change Florida confronted him.
[00:13:21.906 --> 00:13:23.987]  We Are Change Chicago, so that's who we've got coming on.
[00:13:24.307 --> 00:13:26.548]  First off is Nathan from We Are Change.
[00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:29.089]  Do we have Nathan and Mark O'Connor, or are we just going to Nathan?
[00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:32.570]  Okay, Nathan, good to have you here.
[00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:37.992]  Before we get into what you've been doing with Gore and how exciting it is from the inside to be witnessing this, we want your take on that.
[00:13:38.012 --> 00:13:43.614]  What do you think about him canceling his much-vaunted speaking tour in Copenhagen?
[00:13:44.787 --> 00:13:45.147]  I love it.
[00:13:45.687 --> 00:13:48.989]  It shows that we're making the impact that we always knew we would be.
[00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:53.090]  It's just great to see these people cowering, just like he does on the film.
[00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.851]  And you see that time and time again through these We Are Change confrontations.
[00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:58.432]  Just like you always knew it would have an impact.
[00:13:58.452 --> 00:13:58.892]  That's right.
[00:13:59.132 --> 00:14:00.973]  You knew resistance was victory.
[00:14:01.773 --> 00:14:01.974]  Yes.
[00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:03.094]  Absolutely.
[00:14:03.755 --> 00:14:05.597]  And you see it, like I said, time and time again.
[00:14:05.658 --> 00:14:06.599]  He is a coward.
[00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:07.840]  He knows that he's wrong.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.262]  He knows he's part of something wicked.
[00:14:09.803 --> 00:14:13.868]  And when you stand up against him, you see him shiver away like a little beast.
[00:14:13.948 --> 00:14:16.291]  Well, they have their goons grab people every time.
[00:14:16.592 --> 00:14:18.594]  Even if you politely ask them questions, they do.
[00:14:19.736 --> 00:14:19.916]  Yes.
[00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:20.457]  Oh, yeah.
[00:14:20.977 --> 00:14:21.378]  Absolutely.
[00:14:22.793 --> 00:14:24.955]  Well, I think it's important that you be focused.
[00:14:25.356 --> 00:14:31.183]  If you're up close, you know, just speak in a regular voice, but if they start dragging you away, screaming out, climate gate, climate gate, which is happening.
[00:14:32.003 --> 00:14:32.925]  This is just beautiful.
[00:14:32.985 --> 00:14:36.669]  Tell us, tell us about this little short clip we're going to play from Rhode Island.
[00:14:37.771 --> 00:14:45.717]  Okay, it was actually in Boston outside the Wang Theater on March 30th, 2009, a day before the first time we were in Chicago and Ohio confronted him.
[00:14:45.757 --> 00:14:51.962]  It was a speaker's tour that was traveling through some major cities, New York, Boston, Chicago, maybe some others.
[00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:56.105]  And I want to point out again, it's We Are Change that first went out and confronted Gore.
[00:14:56.425 --> 00:14:58.026]  Now the tea parties are mimicking it.
[00:14:58.266 --> 00:14:59.367]  That's how this spreads.
[00:15:00.448 --> 00:15:00.648]  Yes.
[00:15:01.309 --> 00:15:02.530]  We had somebody on the inside.
[00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.192]  We didn't have tickets to the event, but we knew where the back door was.
[00:15:05.592 --> 00:15:07.013]  So Mark O'Connor and I
[00:15:07.597 --> 00:15:09.137]  Mark from We Are Change Boston waited.
[00:15:09.518 --> 00:15:10.298]  We got the cue.
[00:15:10.338 --> 00:15:12.318]  We kind of, you know, seemed harmless.
[00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:12.839]  We were there.
[00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:18.960]  We were handing out DVDs, doing a kind of regular We Are Change street action, but not as obvious.
[00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:21.941]  And we waited, and we knew he was coming out the back door.
[00:15:22.602 --> 00:15:27.383]  I positioned myself amongst the crowd, the small crowd of people, because it was cold in Boston on that night.
[00:15:27.964 --> 00:15:32.828]  Uh, that wanted autographs and managed to get myself right up to the front tell Al Gore to his face.
[00:15:33.168 --> 00:15:34.269]  You know, I had to play the part.
[00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.530]  You hear me in the beginning of the video.
[00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.253]  Be like, hey, brother, uh, we know about your New World Order eugenics program.
[00:15:39.374 --> 00:15:40.214]  You will not succeed.
[00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:47.600]  Everything you talk about at the Club of Rome, Bilderberg, and, and the rest, uh, your population control, Ted Turner's reduction of the population by 95%.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.742]  None of this will go forward.
[00:15:49.942 --> 00:15:52.825]  I, I called, I managed to call him a coward to his face.
[00:15:53.525 --> 00:15:54.706]  Um, he doesn't respond.
[00:15:55.046 --> 00:15:55.487]  He hides.
[00:15:55.547 --> 00:15:56.788]  His security pushes us away.
[00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.071]  And he's escorted, you know, by a police escort away.
[00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:08.555]  We're going to go ahead and play the meat of this clip, and then be sure and plug your website, Nathan.
[00:16:08.615 --> 00:16:15.979]  We Are Change, working with We Are Change Boston, confronting Gore on the population reduction agenda.
[00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:17.059]  Here's that clip.
[00:16:23.002 --> 00:16:23.743]  Mr. Gore, hey.
[00:16:23.783 --> 00:16:24.923]  Hey, how you guys doing?
[00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:25.263]  Hey, brother.
[00:16:25.383 --> 00:16:26.344]  Step back, step back.
[00:16:27.734 --> 00:16:30.215]  Mr. Gore, we know about your New World Order eugenics program.
[00:16:30.915 --> 00:16:32.056]  Well, what do you think about that?
[00:16:32.696 --> 00:16:34.937]  Everything you guys discussed at the Club of Rome in Bilderberg.
[00:16:35.478 --> 00:16:36.358]  Population control.
[00:16:36.558 --> 00:16:37.138]  Thank you very much.
[00:16:37.158 --> 00:16:39.499]  What do you think of Ted Turner's?
[00:16:39.539 --> 00:16:41.620]  Thanks very much.
[00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:49.564]  Sir, do you plan to reduce the Earth's human population by 95% like Ted Turner and advocates?
[00:16:50.544 --> 00:16:56.107]  Do you plan to reduce the Earth's population of humans by 95% like Ted Turner and advocates, sir?
[00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.112]  Can you please tell us?
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.843]  You guys will not succeed.
[00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:04.865]  Step back, step back.
[00:17:04.885 --> 00:17:05.566]  Aw, you step back.
[00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.294]  Hey, Free Humanity is waking up!
[00:17:13.726 --> 00:17:14.647]  In fact, back that up.
[00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:20.010]  I want to read that quote from Al Gore from one of his disgusting books of propaganda that polar bears can't swim.
[00:17:30.094 --> 00:17:30.174]  Yes.
[00:17:59.235 --> 00:18:03.256]  Yeah, and I would like to say I did a lot of reading before I made the decision to go get him.
[00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:10.838]  I mean, checking into the International Crisis Group, Brookings Institution, the IPCC documents, going back to, I think it was founded by the UN in 1988.
[00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:17.180]  We really, Mark and I, you know, we looked up a lot of stuff and I encourage everyone listening right now to read.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.380]  Reading will open your eyes to all of this.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.120]  They're real plans.
[00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:26.982]  Right now I'm reading a book by Peter Singer, who is friends with Paul Ehrlich, John Holdren,
[00:18:27.475 --> 00:18:36.501]  You know, there are quotes in this book from them, praise on the back cover, from Holdren and Ehrlich, and this is called One World.
[00:18:36.821 --> 00:18:42.685]  This is a man that openly supports euthanasia, abortion, infanticide, global government.
[00:18:44.186 --> 00:18:44.846]  This stuff is real.
[00:18:45.486 --> 00:18:50.670]  We own over a hundred books by these people where they brag they're drugging our water supply.
[00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.011]  I mean, these are hardcore people.
[00:18:53.992 --> 00:18:54.132]  Yes.
[00:18:55.393 --> 00:18:56.654]  Yes, they are not kidding around.
[00:18:57.114 --> 00:18:59.076]  And we are changes here to stand up to them.
[00:19:00.077 --> 00:19:00.778]  And we're not going to stop.
[00:19:01.378 --> 00:19:04.100]  Well, sir, I really appreciate what you've done.
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:10.646]  We have another clip of you guys confronting him that we're going to come back out of the break with and we're going to let you go.
[00:19:10.686 --> 00:19:15.150]  But I really appreciate what you're doing and the great job that all of you are doing.
[00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.772]  And notice how it starts small with you guys six months ago.
[00:19:18.192 --> 00:19:22.015]  That is now 200, 300 people out confronting him, bringing up ClimateGate.
[00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:26.679]  If you guys wouldn't have been doing this six months ago, it wouldn't have built for the crescendo now.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:32.544]  So it's exploding just perfectly right on time in his face as he cancels his Copenhagen trip.
[00:19:32.824 --> 00:19:36.748]  Plug the We Are Change website in Rhode Island or Boston for folks that want to join the team.
[00:19:38.242 --> 00:19:39.663]  Go to wearechange.org.
[00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:44.905]  RhodeIslandChange.org is the website, but we're changing the host right now, so it's down, unfortunately, at the moment.
[00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:46.246]  But it will be back up.
[00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:51.228]  And to everybody that's contacted me recently, I can't wait to meet all the new people that are joining up with We Are Change Rhode Island.
[00:19:51.748 --> 00:19:53.289]  Well done, my friend.
[00:19:53.369 --> 00:19:54.129]  We salute you.
[00:19:55.049 --> 00:19:55.950]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.511]  We'll be right back with We Are Change Nashville.
[00:20:00.222 --> 00:20:04.483]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.
[00:20:04.823 --> 00:20:12.365]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:27.408]  The revolutionary Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.
[00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:32.349]  Order the Berkey light system today, complete with two black Berkey elements for only two hundred and nine dollars.
[00:20:32.409 --> 00:20:37.011]  And the Berkey guy will include three sport Berkey water bottles and ship everything to you free of charge.
[00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:37.711]  That's right.
[00:20:37.911 --> 00:20:41.552]  Three sport Berkey water bottles and free shipping and eighty seven dollar value.
[00:20:41.652 --> 00:20:43.913]  Yours free, but only for a limited time.
[00:20:44.173 --> 00:20:45.253]  Just call the Berkey guy at 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53.
[00:20:45.594 --> 00:20:45.854]  Now to order.
[00:20:45.874 --> 00:20:46.874]  That's 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53 or order online now at
[00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:04.617]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:04.998 --> 00:21:08.003]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:08.243 --> 00:21:09.666]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:13.028]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:13.048 --> 00:21:19.250]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:24.452]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:24.472 --> 00:21:34.576]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:34.716 --> 00:21:36.838]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:37.078 --> 00:21:38.400]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.942]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:41.122 --> 00:21:42.984]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:43.245 --> 00:21:48.049]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:57.519]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:59.409 --> 00:22:03.274]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible, federal deficit spending?
[00:22:03.514 --> 00:22:07.659]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:09.161]  You get less for your money.
[00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:15.228]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at MIDAS Resources.
[00:22:15.248 --> 00:22:15.288]  800-686-8000.
[00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:17.310]  I think?
[00:22:41.749 --> 00:22:42.809]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:44.509]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.790]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:23:09.804 --> 00:23:18.706]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[00:23:19.027 --> 00:23:20.927]  Rely instead on oxysilver.
[00:23:21.247 --> 00:23:26.689]  Oxysilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:23:26.969 --> 00:23:31.730]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:37.092]  It works so well, saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[00:23:37.112 --> 00:23:40.193]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:23:40.473 --> 00:23:45.496]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[00:23:45.996 --> 00:23:48.837]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[00:23:49.277 --> 00:23:52.218]  Call toll free 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:54.819]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.660]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.301]  This call could save your life.
[00:24:09.804 --> 00:24:11.145]  Al Gore, we know about you!
[00:24:12.425 --> 00:24:14.426]  We know this global warming thing is a hoax!
[00:24:16.286 --> 00:24:17.427]  You want a carbon credit?
[00:24:17.747 --> 00:24:18.547]  Carbon taxes?
[00:24:19.087 --> 00:24:20.408]  That's a tax on life, sir!
[00:24:22.428 --> 00:24:23.649]  Respond, you coward!
[00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:30.351]  Ladies and gentlemen, none of this would be happening now
[00:24:31.758 --> 00:24:36.759]  If just a few people hadn't started standing up, and I can tell you, we are responsible.
[00:24:37.059 --> 00:24:39.479]  Myself, Luke Radowski, and all these other men and women.
[00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:41.880]  You can start your own group.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.320]  Whether it's We Are Change, I think the more the better.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.120]  Create a We Are Change, create another group.
[00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:49.221]  I push my audience, my listeners to join, to get involved.
[00:24:49.241 --> 00:24:51.261]  There's no forms, no organization.
[00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:54.562]  It's just a name, people that want truth, that want to defeat the New World Order.
[00:24:54.922 --> 00:25:01.003]  And it's impossible for the globalists to infiltrate groups like We Are Change, because there's nothing to infiltrate.
[00:25:02.472 --> 00:25:04.914]  There's Luke's website that has links to all the other groups.
[00:25:06.995 --> 00:25:08.256]  It's impossible to stop.
[00:25:08.316 --> 00:25:13.680]  They've tried to infiltrate chapters, and we've confirmed that, and tried to get people to do illegal stuff.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.481]  It hasn't worked.
[00:25:15.141 --> 00:25:17.043]  They've tried to falsely charge We Are Change.
[00:25:17.483 --> 00:25:30.953]  Women and men running out of dark doorways at events with a person in a wheelchair, ramming it into someone, and then putting it in the newspaper that We Are Change assaulted a girl in a wheelchair, and later it came out the New York Post had to print a retraction and say it was all a hoax.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.421]  Because they went to court and proved it was a fraud!
[00:25:34.441 --> 00:25:38.764]  I mean, do you see what we're going through?
[00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:40.305]  What these great people are going through?
[00:25:40.365 --> 00:25:43.007]  And they've gone in through and beyond the tyranny.
[00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:46.048]  And Al Gore has now cancelled his major events.
[00:25:46.148 --> 00:25:48.210]  I was telling you last hour he's going to start cancelling events.
[00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:49.570]  He's now cancelling.
[00:25:49.891 --> 00:25:54.193]  He'll only be able to do TV now because it's the only place that'll be one-sided.
[00:25:55.294 --> 00:25:57.155]  He's under siege with his fraud.
[00:25:59.005 --> 00:26:01.746]  Let's go to Matt from We Are Change Nashville.
[00:26:02.246 --> 00:26:04.266]  We've got some video of their confronting Gore.
[00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:07.887]  And when they did it, it was all over the newspapers, all over radio, all over TV.
[00:26:08.348 --> 00:26:12.749]  Their quotes about his fraud, about his lies, about how he's making money off of it.
[00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:20.291]  Again, taking over the media coverage as our right as Americans, going to these events and telling the truth.
[00:26:23.311 --> 00:26:26.552]  And we've got Savannah, who's with We Are Change as well, with Matt.
[00:26:26.932 --> 00:26:27.793]  Great job, guys.
[00:26:27.813 --> 00:26:28.653]  Good to have you here with us.
[00:26:30.123 --> 00:26:30.783]  Thank you for having us.
[00:26:31.324 --> 00:26:31.884]  Thank you.
[00:26:32.364 --> 00:26:36.367]  What is it like for you to be involved in this and see it bearing such incredible fruit?
[00:26:38.208 --> 00:26:38.968]  It's really inspiring.
[00:26:39.028 --> 00:26:44.011]  I mean, we set out that day, we didn't know what was going to happen, but we knew that we had to be there, we had to do something.
[00:26:44.391 --> 00:26:46.812]  So, it worked out pretty good.
[00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:54.276]  Before it started, before Al Gore came out, we were passing out articles to people online, just trying to talk to people.
[00:26:54.456 --> 00:26:57.078]  Most of them didn't want to hear it, most of them didn't want the articles.
[00:26:58.143 --> 00:27:00.505]  But it doesn't matter, you know, we've got to stand up.
[00:27:02.626 --> 00:27:13.475]  Well, it ended up getting a lot of media coverage, and I want to play just a short clip, which is just a little bird's eye view, audio for radio listeners, video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:27:13.495 --> 00:27:15.936]  Of course, we post all these videos up at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:16.257 --> 00:27:16.717]  Here it is.
[00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:19.139]  Al Gore, you're a traitor.
[00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:20.980]  Your carbon tax is meant to enslave America.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:21.461]  We know it.
[00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:23.162]  We don't want your global governance.
[00:27:23.182 --> 00:27:24.483]  We don't want your global governance.
[00:27:24.563 --> 00:27:25.684]  We don't want your carbon tax.
[00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:27.939]  You're a traitor!
[00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:33.901]  Yeah, so Alex, I also, um, I also went up to Gore.
[00:27:34.161 --> 00:27:47.865]  Um, I bought a book myself and asked him, um, what his, what, when he talked about global governance in a speech on July 7th, I asked him what he meant by that term and, um, one of his PR ladies just grabbed me and pushed me out of the way.
[00:27:47.885 --> 00:27:56.648]  You're not allowed to ask, you're allowed to talk to him as long as it's worshipping him, but you can't ask about an internationally televised speech he gave because global government doesn't exist.
[00:27:58.308 --> 00:28:07.773]  Yes, I mean, even if I bought, I paid $30 for a book so I could ask him this question, and I can't even... It's ridiculous.
[00:28:08.973 --> 00:28:19.799]  Well, I want to point out that the protest outside made it in the paper and on TV, and the clips we're showing are just a tiny snapshot of all the things that are happening at these events.
[00:28:23.541 --> 00:28:25.662]  Well, quickly, there's a reporter there, and
[00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:33.333]  When I was in the back talking to a small group of people, I mean, I guess it made enough noise where she came over and was kind of listening to what we were saying.
[00:28:34.233 --> 00:28:39.996]  She identified herself as a reporter, and I gave her a copy of Fall Republic so that, you know, if she could watch that, it'd be great.
[00:28:40.296 --> 00:28:47.259]  And that's actually how we got in the paper, was that the reporter that was listening to us talk, you know, before Al Gore was even there.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.003]  And then, obviously, she covered the point when I called him a traitor, and that was one of the main things she put in the paper about it.
[00:28:56.744 --> 00:29:00.526]  WeAreChangedNashville.com, and it's not just Al Gore.
[00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:08.310]  Go after any globalist, gun grabbers, child grabbers, forced inoculators, people that are promoting the end of our sovereignty.
[00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:19.275]  Expand the group, continue to go out, continue to get involved, continue to have your voice be heard, showing that we are the majority, we are the American people, and we're not backing down.
[00:29:19.695 --> 00:29:21.696]  Savannah and Matt, anything else?
[00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:23.167]  Yes, sir.
[00:29:23.187 --> 00:29:25.048]  We got a protest this weekend, Saturday at 2.30.
[00:29:25.388 --> 00:29:28.289]  It's in a Belcourt Theater in Nashville.
[00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:30.530]  We're doing a protest in March for a common case.
[00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:39.774]  Definitely encourage all those other We Are Change groups to definitely get out there and do something, especially with Copenhagen coming up this week.
[00:29:39.874 --> 00:29:42.375]  Just go out there and drive it.
[00:29:43.495 --> 00:29:45.236]  And he's got another film coming out.
[00:29:45.276 --> 00:29:47.297]  We'll all demonstrate outside those theaters.
[00:29:47.317 --> 00:29:47.937]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.123 --> 00:29:53.106]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.047 --> 00:29:56.730]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.246 --> 00:30:03.227]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:30:03.347 --> 00:30:06.088]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:30:06.228 --> 00:30:08.189]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:10.429]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:12.070]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.531]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:30:16.671 --> 00:30:19.032]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:42.744]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[00:30:47.027 --> 00:30:48.949]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:03.213]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:03.533 --> 00:31:07.615]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:13.298]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:13.618 --> 00:31:14.079]  It's true.
[00:31:14.379 --> 00:31:18.921]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.241 --> 00:31:19.782]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.062 --> 00:31:23.344]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:23.645 --> 00:31:27.387]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:27.568 --> 00:31:28.108]  Number 4.
[00:31:28.368 --> 00:31:30.730]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:34.513]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:35.013]  Number 5.
[00:31:35.594 --> 00:31:39.517]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:39.737 --> 00:31:44.501]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:44.781 --> 00:31:48.806]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:48.946 --> 00:31:50.528]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:33:07.449 --> 00:33:12.094]  I'm going to break down the economy, the Federal Reserve in deep trouble being exposed and routed.
[00:33:12.114 --> 00:33:16.678]  I'm going to blitz through the latest next hour on ClimateGate.
[00:33:16.778 --> 00:33:18.260]  So many new developments on that front.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.122]  This is blowing up even bigger than I thought it would.
[00:33:20.142 --> 00:33:22.164]  This is just such good news.
[00:33:22.684 --> 00:33:24.346]  I've been walking on air the last few days.
[00:33:25.367 --> 00:33:27.269]  Because this shows these people are not invincible.
[00:33:27.429 --> 00:33:28.430]  I have always known that.
[00:33:28.951 --> 00:33:33.155]  But other people are now discovering this and finding it out for themselves.
[00:33:33.736 --> 00:33:39.942]  And now that ClimateGate is out, so many people that trusted the government and the scientists and the media, that didn't know the scientists were on the UN payroll,
[00:33:40.783 --> 00:33:58.149]  Are now ready to hear the truth and that's why my film Fall of the Republic is so important because a whole hour of this two-hour 24-minute film is about how the banks engineered the crisis, how they created the climate scam, how you will pay your taxes directly to them, how it's a eugenic system.
[00:33:58.589 --> 00:34:00.589]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:03.230]  People are ready to see this film.
[00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:04.891]  Get it at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:08.692]  And while supplies last, if you order you get it.
[00:34:09.588 --> 00:34:10.109]  I don't know.
[00:34:33.491 --> 00:34:39.856]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or Infowars.com.
[00:34:39.896 --> 00:34:44.840]  And your purchase also of the film and the free t-shirt makes what we're doing here possible.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:51.705]  So I want to thank all you out there that have been supporting us so we can then support all these other activist groups and give them a platform to fight the globalists.
[00:34:52.145 --> 00:34:54.547]  I mean, this is really happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:55.928]  We're part of something very big.
[00:34:55.948 --> 00:35:03.692]  The momentum is beginning to shift in our direction, in the side of liberty and freedom and honor and duty and everything that is valuable and good.
[00:35:04.112 --> 00:35:06.453]  We are exposing these criminals for what they are.
[00:35:06.653 --> 00:35:08.234]  Illegitimate criminals.
[00:35:08.835 --> 00:35:10.275]  Murderous control freaks.
[00:35:10.916 --> 00:35:13.397]  That's strong language, but that's not strong enough.
[00:35:14.938 --> 00:35:16.319]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:35:16.759 --> 00:35:18.360]  And we're facing some very wicked people.
[00:35:19.673 --> 00:35:25.256]  Now we've got We Are Change Toronto, We Are Change Florida, and Saving the Most Powerful for Last.
[00:35:25.276 --> 00:35:33.541]  I mean, they made the big sudden death overtime score at the Super Bowl here, a political action.
[00:35:34.142 --> 00:35:44.548]  Saeed and Steve from We Are Change Chicago coming up with a powerhouse video clip we played earlier in the week that hundreds of thousands of views online.
[00:35:45.629 --> 00:35:48.570]  Just devastating to the globalists.
[00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:52.251]  Absolutely devastating, and we salute them and their work.
[00:35:52.271 --> 00:36:03.976]  And again, Al Gore is not just being confronted about lying about the hockey stick graph that they've now proven is a fraud they've had to withdraw, or lying and saying polar bears can't swim and they're all basically dead when their numbers have exploded.
[00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:07.118]  Or saying the Arctic's going to totally melt and then it doesn't.
[00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:15.223]  Showing a time lapse of the summer when the Arctic and Antarctic gets smaller, but not showing you in the winter how they get bigger again.
[00:36:15.703 --> 00:36:16.804]  The ice caps go like this.
[00:36:20.066 --> 00:36:21.227]  The ice caps go like this.
[00:36:21.787 --> 00:36:22.148]  And of course,
[00:36:23.288 --> 00:36:32.434]  Well, I mean the point is, is that now we have their internal emails and Al Gore's cancelling his Copenhagen propaganda because he can't go speak now.
[00:36:32.494 --> 00:36:38.178]  He knows there's going to be Lord Moncton is going to be reporting here live for us and others and thousands of activists exposing him.
[00:36:38.619 --> 00:36:39.459]  He can't allow it.
[00:36:39.499 --> 00:36:42.361]  If he goes it will make it a spectacle and then the truth will come out.
[00:36:43.162 --> 00:36:46.504]  But instead he won't be there now, will be there, exposing them.
[00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:47.405]  You see?
[00:36:49.562 --> 00:36:53.024]  So it's just so incredible to see this happening.
[00:36:53.064 --> 00:36:55.185]  And now we're not just talking about all the climate fraud.
[00:36:55.385 --> 00:36:57.146]  People are going, well, what did Al Gore write?
[00:36:57.186 --> 00:37:00.687]  Well, what did John P. Holdren write in Ecoscience?
[00:37:01.608 --> 00:37:03.268]  What are they saying in all these textbooks?
[00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:14.834]  They're saying we need, and in fake environmental crises, to get people to give up their rights for a scientific dictatorship so we can set up world government to forcibly reduce population numbers.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:22.702]  I mean, this is in hundreds of government documents that we quote, that we link, that we cover up on the websites, that we cover every day.
[00:37:22.742 --> 00:37:23.682]  We give you their quotes.
[00:37:23.722 --> 00:37:24.622]  We give you their books.
[00:37:24.923 --> 00:37:27.023]  We give you where they said it, how they did it.
[00:37:27.143 --> 00:37:32.025]  I know it's hard to believe they brag in this book how they're drugging your water supply.
[00:37:33.265 --> 00:37:34.145]  But they're doing it.
[00:37:34.305 --> 00:37:36.566]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[00:37:36.886 --> 00:37:39.967]  There's a reason people are so docile and servile.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.161]  Okay, Dan from We Are Change Toronto.
[00:37:44.181 --> 00:37:47.803]  Now, this ended up getting in the news as well, even when they didn't get in to see Al Gore.
[00:37:48.884 --> 00:37:49.544]  That doesn't matter.
[00:37:49.584 --> 00:37:51.986]  They took over the media attention and inserted real issues.
[00:37:52.026 --> 00:37:55.728]  But, first they tell him, you can't be in front of the event.
[00:37:55.868 --> 00:37:57.208]  Then you gotta be down the street.
[00:37:57.228 --> 00:37:58.369]  Then you gotta be across the street.
[00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:59.550]  Then they rough him up.
[00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.952]  This is the type of oppression we're seeing all over the western world.
[00:38:05.225 --> 00:38:07.107]  So let's go ahead.
[00:38:07.127 --> 00:38:08.368]  I mean, take Copenhagen.
[00:38:08.548 --> 00:38:12.672]  They're not allowing any media in who have ever been critical of man-made climate change.
[00:38:12.912 --> 00:38:16.936]  Only people that agree are allowed into all these events coming up this weekend and next week.
[00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:22.481]  Okay, let's go to Dan from We Are Change Toronto.
[00:38:22.521 --> 00:38:24.003]  Dan, good to have you on with us.
[00:38:25.244 --> 00:38:25.965]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.041]  Tell us briefly what happened to you.
[00:38:30.061 --> 00:38:35.202]  Great, great, beautiful website for TorontoChange.com.
[00:38:35.822 --> 00:38:36.802]  Absolutely awesome.
[00:38:37.082 --> 00:38:38.442]  Tell us what happened to you.
[00:38:39.743 --> 00:38:40.163]  Sure, yeah.
[00:38:40.183 --> 00:38:45.404]  I'm actually also a member of an organization called Press for Truth.
[00:38:45.504 --> 00:38:47.404]  It's a journalism company.
[00:38:47.684 --> 00:38:53.285]  I actually registered it with the Ontario government as a legitimate alternative media outlet.
[00:38:53.365 --> 00:38:54.406]  Yeah, I've seen your work.
[00:38:54.766 --> 00:38:55.146]  Excellent.
[00:38:56.286 --> 00:38:56.586]  Thank you.
[00:38:57.028 --> 00:39:03.892]  So we were there literally just, you know, as press to cover the latest information on the climate change.
[00:39:04.592 --> 00:39:13.558]  We were there for no more than 45 minutes doing our reporting when the security guards came up and told us to leave the grounds.
[00:39:14.038 --> 00:39:15.159]  And I said, you know, that's fine.
[00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:17.760]  If this is your private property, I understand that.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.361]  I will leave.
[00:39:18.881 --> 00:39:20.742]  So I went to the other side of the gate.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:28.144]  And, uh, you know, I just started rolling and the two security guards came up to me and said, uh, you're going to have to leave.
[00:39:28.184 --> 00:39:30.626]  They actually tried to make me walk into the road.
[00:39:31.266 --> 00:39:32.587]  Uh, there was traffic in the road.
[00:39:32.827 --> 00:39:34.308]  So they tried to push you into the road.
[00:39:34.728 --> 00:39:37.269]  And of course the news just said a terrorist was run over.
[00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:40.051]  A terrorist jumped into traffic today and was killed.
[00:39:41.132 --> 00:39:41.532]  That's right.
[00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:49.857]  And as I was trying to get clarification for where indeed is this property line, uh, my, my cameraman turned around to take a look.
[00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:53.252]  And that's when the security guard just lunged for the camera.
[00:39:53.873 --> 00:40:00.598]  He grabbed it and he physically turned over the camera and started pressing buttons until he figured out how to shut it off.
[00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:01.619]  Just nuts!
[00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:02.520]  Totally nuts!
[00:40:03.661 --> 00:40:05.622]  It's completely uncalled for.
[00:40:06.023 --> 00:40:11.047]  So at that point I turned it back on because I just witnessed an assault on my cameraman.
[00:40:11.147 --> 00:40:15.250]  So I turned it back on for my protection and for, you know, Mark's protection.
[00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.933]  And we continued to document everything that was going on.
[00:40:19.748 --> 00:40:22.630]  And then he eventually told us that, no, we still own this.
[00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:23.850]  You're still on our property.
[00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:25.351]  You have to move further away.
[00:40:27.052 --> 00:40:29.693]  But the good thing is I managed to remain calm.
[00:40:30.373 --> 00:40:32.474]  I didn't sink to his level.
[00:40:32.715 --> 00:40:33.855]  I kept my cool.
[00:40:34.535 --> 00:40:39.218]  And because of that, we were actually able to get retribution for the incident.
[00:40:40.178 --> 00:40:43.660]  The head of security actually called me and apologized.
[00:40:44.195 --> 00:40:44.816]  We're good to go.
[00:40:59.406 --> 00:40:59.746]  That's right.
[00:40:59.766 --> 00:41:01.668]  And with the letter of apology, that is an omission of guilt.
[00:41:01.688 --> 00:41:02.789]  They know they were in the wrong.
[00:41:25.492 --> 00:41:30.450]  But it just goes to show, if you remain calm and you handle it and follow up in a professional way...
[00:41:31.302 --> 00:41:34.224]  Then, you know, the good guys can and will win in the end.
[00:41:34.364 --> 00:41:39.387]  And by the way, I found security guards are even worse than police everywhere in the country.
[00:41:39.687 --> 00:41:43.509]  I mean, I'll be at a park or on a sidewalk and they'll just march over and say, turn your cameras off.
[00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.470]  You have to have a permit to even be in the city.
[00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:46.211]  And I'm like, no.
[00:41:46.231 --> 00:41:52.414]  And there's a famous video, Kansas City this year, of Aaron and Rob at a city park.
[00:41:52.935 --> 00:41:59.719]  And the Federal Reserve Security comes a half mile, puts their hands on their guns and says, we're going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[00:42:00.904 --> 00:42:03.927]  And of course, totally off their jurisdiction, totally out of control.
[00:42:04.228 --> 00:42:10.195]  These are lunatics on a power trip and it turned out they were ordered by the fellow reserve to go out and do this.
[00:42:10.235 --> 00:42:13.780]  These people think they're gods and we are living in Nazi Germany.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.281]  We're not.
[00:42:14.561 --> 00:42:16.904]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of part of the incident.
[00:42:16.944 --> 00:42:17.325]  Here it is.
[00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.071]  What's the scoop, guys?
[00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:20.571]  What's going on?
[00:42:20.591 --> 00:42:24.873]  Our client doesn't want you guys hanging around here right now.
[00:42:24.974 --> 00:42:27.175]  It's a private event.
[00:42:27.235 --> 00:42:28.535]  Cameras aren't even allowed on the grounds.
[00:42:28.555 --> 00:42:31.857]  It's a bylaw against exhibition place property.
[00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:33.358]  Same with handing out flyers to people.
[00:42:33.378 --> 00:42:37.520]  It's part of our bylaw offenses.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.022]  All this is owned by the C&E, I'm guessing?
[00:42:40.042 --> 00:42:41.002]  The whole grounds.
[00:42:41.402 --> 00:42:44.644]  From the Princess Gates, Dufferin, down to Lake Shore.
[00:42:45.144 --> 00:42:47.286]  So we ask you guys if you want to conduct your activities.
[00:42:48.578 --> 00:42:53.622]  What's happening more and more is they have huge city centers for people that aren't watching the video but are listening on the radio.
[00:42:54.463 --> 00:42:58.807]  You can go to TorontoChange.com and watch the whole video.
[00:42:59.948 --> 00:43:01.049]  They do this in Austin now.
[00:43:01.089 --> 00:43:02.010]  They do this in Dallas.
[00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.790]  They do this everywhere.
[00:43:03.091 --> 00:43:06.434]  They just block off whole areas and now say whole areas of cities.
[00:43:07.466 --> 00:43:08.727]  Let's finish the video.
[00:43:37.892 --> 00:43:49.921]  He submitted to their power trip, right there by the highway you just saw, so now the power tripping intensifies.
[00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:54.924]  Because to a petty thug, someone submitting to their tyranny is a sign that it's okay.
[00:43:55.444 --> 00:43:56.125]  Let's keep playing.
[00:43:57.389 --> 00:43:59.672]  Guys, if you don't mind just completely getting off the property.
[00:43:59.752 --> 00:44:02.536]  Uh, they told us the property that you guys own is right here.
[00:44:02.556 --> 00:44:02.716]  Okay.
[00:44:02.736 --> 00:44:04.138]  And this is public property.
[00:44:04.178 --> 00:44:04.979]  That's not true.
[00:44:04.999 --> 00:44:06.681]  You have to get right onto the road.
[00:44:06.821 --> 00:44:10.867]  Okay, so where is... Just right on the road in the bike lane there.
[00:44:11.087 --> 00:44:13.610]  Well, we obviously can't stand on the road.
[00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:14.512]  Okay, across the street.
[00:44:15.192 --> 00:44:18.274]  We have him on video saying go outside the gates but but now
[00:44:44.818 --> 00:44:45.858]  Again, you can hear him.
[00:44:46.439 --> 00:44:47.599]  I told you, I'm powerful.
[00:44:47.639 --> 00:44:48.159]  I'm nobody.
[00:44:48.199 --> 00:44:49.320]  I live in a cruddy apartment.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.841]  You know, I'm nobody.
[00:44:52.121 --> 00:44:53.621]  But at least I can dominate you.
[00:44:53.681 --> 00:44:55.042]  At least I've got power over you.
[00:44:55.462 --> 00:44:56.403]  God, I love big government.
[00:44:56.423 --> 00:44:58.043]  Oh, I wish I could take everything you've got.
[00:44:58.343 --> 00:44:59.104]  Pretty soon we will.
[00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:01.304]  Let's go back.
[00:45:01.545 --> 00:45:02.585]  I'm assaulting you right now.
[00:45:02.825 --> 00:45:03.285]  I'm good.
[00:45:03.385 --> 00:45:03.805]  I'm good.
[00:45:03.905 --> 00:45:04.246]  I'm good.
[00:45:04.346 --> 00:45:04.906]  I own you.
[00:45:05.046 --> 00:45:05.846]  You're my property.
[00:45:05.986 --> 00:45:06.767]  Let's play the rest of it.
[00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:07.427]  Look at my finger.
[00:45:07.627 --> 00:45:08.327]  See all the way up there?
[00:45:08.347 --> 00:45:09.127]  Okay, now I know.
[00:45:09.167 --> 00:45:10.068]  Turn your camera off.
[00:45:13.229 --> 00:45:13.549]  Let me see.
[00:45:13.629 --> 00:45:14.790]  All the way out over there.
[00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.532]  You're not allowed here.
[00:45:16.572 --> 00:45:22.136]  All the way down.
[00:45:22.236 --> 00:45:24.078]  All the way to the back.
[00:45:25.628 --> 00:45:26.689]  No, no, no.
[00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:28.210]  This is public property.
[00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.970]  We can be here.
[00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.591]  You want to go out there by the light?
[00:45:30.711 --> 00:45:31.512]  You're more than welcome to.
[00:45:31.532 --> 00:45:32.072]  By the light?
[00:45:32.432 --> 00:45:34.873]  Right there is public-private property, isn't it?
[00:45:34.953 --> 00:45:35.374]  Excuse me.
[00:45:35.434 --> 00:45:36.214]  I have a question.
[00:45:36.254 --> 00:45:36.494]  Yes.
[00:45:36.694 --> 00:45:37.755]  Is that public property right there?
[00:45:37.775 --> 00:45:38.675]  We're going to turn it off here.
[00:45:38.695 --> 00:45:40.076]  This is still exhibition place property.
[00:45:40.096 --> 00:45:43.778]  We're going to turn it off here because there is some little bit of profanity that comes up.
[00:45:44.098 --> 00:45:50.962]  Gentlemen, great job, though, exposing these people because if we're not out there doing this, they're going to completely train everybody that we have no rights.
[00:45:51.382 --> 00:45:51.843]  I commend you.
[00:45:51.883 --> 00:45:53.664]  We'll talk to you again soon, Dan.
[00:45:53.704 --> 00:45:54.024]  Thank you.
[00:45:54.844 --> 00:45:55.606]  Thank you very much.
[00:45:55.646 --> 00:45:58.735]  It definitely feels great to be fighting the good fight.
[00:45:59.296 --> 00:46:02.104]  And people can check that out at PressForTruth.ca as well.
[00:46:02.446 --> 00:46:02.926]  All right, buddy.
[00:46:02.966 --> 00:46:03.786]  Thank you so much.
[00:46:03.846 --> 00:46:04.387]  Great job.
[00:46:04.987 --> 00:46:11.709]  Okay, we got to hurry here because we got We Are Change Florida, and there's so many other people confronting, but I want to get to the big granddaddy of them all.
[00:46:11.729 --> 00:46:12.869]  A little bit into the next hour now.
[00:46:12.889 --> 00:46:21.331]  We're running behind here with Saeed and Steve from What We Are Change Chicago, also working with We Are Change Ohio, and there's so many other groups.
[00:46:21.372 --> 00:46:25.113]  We Are Change LA, We Are Change Colorado, who confronted Gore.
[00:46:25.573 --> 00:46:26.453]  We just salute them.
[00:46:26.473 --> 00:46:27.773]  This is only one thing they're doing.
[00:46:28.354 --> 00:46:28.994]  Let's go to
[00:46:30.316 --> 00:46:36.123]  I am from Florida and this is the first, let's play the clips now.
[00:46:36.443 --> 00:46:41.048]  First clip is a huge crowd booing Al Gore at one of his speaking engagements in Boca Raton.
[00:46:41.088 --> 00:46:42.209]  This made national news.
[00:46:43.637 --> 00:46:45.339]  This made national news everywhere.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:57.892]  This was in the newspapers, national TV, local TV, and their posters, their signs, their statements about how he's making money, how he's been proven to be a fraud, how they're more polar bears ended up on TV, radio, and print.
[00:46:58.272 --> 00:47:04.979]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars of news coverage for free because these people came out and outnumbered the people inside.
[00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:06.140]  Here's the first clip.
[00:47:14.858 --> 00:47:16.239]  We're going to start that over.
[00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:17.099]  Let's hit pause.
[00:47:17.319 --> 00:47:17.899]  Let's hit pause.
[00:47:17.919 --> 00:47:19.620]  We're going to back that up and start that over.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.461]  I want people to be able to see the video.
[00:47:21.481 --> 00:47:24.142]  So when we're ready with that, just tell me.
[00:47:25.403 --> 00:47:25.703]  Pardon me?
[00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:29.504]  Sure.
[00:47:29.985 --> 00:47:33.386]  All right, let's go to Ian while we mess with the computers here.
[00:47:33.406 --> 00:47:37.988]  Ian, really, really exciting what ended up happening.
[00:47:40.749 --> 00:47:42.070]  Ian from We Are Change.
[00:47:43.612 --> 00:47:44.292]  Florida, are you there?
[00:47:44.312 --> 00:47:45.173]  I'm here, Alex.
[00:47:45.233 --> 00:47:46.034]  Okay, good to have you.
[00:47:46.074 --> 00:47:47.615]  Glad we got you up.
[00:47:47.815 --> 00:47:51.477]  So, in a nutshell, what do you think of Gore getting in all this trouble?
[00:47:51.497 --> 00:47:56.520]  What do you think of the fact that he's cancelling his speaking tour in Copenhagen for the Copenhagen event?
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.722]  I mean, this fraud is really in trouble.
[00:48:00.363 --> 00:48:08.187]  I think he's beyond flustered, and the timing of us putting on that event in an outdoor venue in Florida was very exciting for me.
[00:48:08.228 --> 00:48:10.189]  The following two weeks after, it just seemed
[00:48:11.395 --> 00:48:19.818]  Uh, very meant to be the timing of creating that kind of opposition momentum that's really been stirring throughout the country before, during, and since that event.
[00:48:20.478 --> 00:48:27.141]  And it's just been a highly exciting past couple weeks to watch all of this unfold and him be exposed the way he's been.
[00:48:29.005 --> 00:48:29.986]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:48:30.066 --> 00:48:31.607]  And again, this got massive coverage.
[00:48:31.627 --> 00:48:35.209]  We're going to play, that other clip won't load for some reason, of the booing, the mass booing.
[00:48:35.229 --> 00:48:39.091]  We're going to play a clip of Hannity covering this.
[00:48:39.111 --> 00:48:42.573]  You know, he's denied global government, denied this is a conspiracy all these years.
[00:48:42.893 --> 00:48:45.055]  Now the elites themselves announce it's world government.
[00:48:45.375 --> 00:48:47.476]  It is the funding mechanism for a world government.
[00:48:47.716 --> 00:48:49.297]  We have the internal UN documents.
[00:48:49.718 --> 00:48:53.060]  But here he is finally talking about it and playing your video.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:53.440]  Here it is.
[00:49:04.187 --> 00:49:13.571]  And tonight's meltdown comes to us from the Gateway Pundit blog, and according to their website, former Vice President Al Gore wasn't exactly greeted with open arms in Florida last week.
[00:49:13.851 --> 00:49:19.013]  Now the Learjet liberal was the keynote speaker at a Going Green event in Boca Raton.
[00:49:19.713 --> 00:49:24.355]  Turns out that those attending the lecture may have been outnumbered by the protesters outside.
[00:49:24.755 --> 00:49:28.957]  Now take a look at this video captured by NBC affiliate WPTV.
[00:49:34.555 --> 00:49:43.758]  I just want to let people know that there's an opposing viewpoint and it needs to be listened to.
[00:49:43.778 --> 00:49:47.359]  If you follow the money, it tells you all you need to know about Al Gore.
[00:49:47.679 --> 00:49:53.201]  He's making zillions of dollars off of all the energy-related stuff he's selling.
[00:49:53.881 --> 00:49:54.562]  Great point.
[00:49:54.662 --> 00:49:58.103]  Now you'd think by now that Al Gore would want to avoid the state of Florida altogether.
[00:49:58.123 --> 00:50:01.224]  He doesn't exactly have a good track record down there.
[00:50:03.638 --> 00:50:04.598]  So there you go.
[00:50:05.518 --> 00:50:09.119]  We're going to get a break in a moment, but going back to him in Florida.
[00:50:09.159 --> 00:50:13.360]  I mean, this got massive coverage on TV, radio and print in Florida.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.921]  Oh, yeah, it was incredible.
[00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:29.123]  And, you know, that being Hannity, you know, obviously we don't agree with everything that he spews, but it was great to get on national coverage and then wake up more people to go and discover and study this on their own.
[00:50:30.168 --> 00:50:39.233]  And the word is in the newspaper that you're chanting outside was drowning out his speech to the minions that had paid thousands of dollars to go see him.
[00:50:41.274 --> 00:50:49.059]  Well, I really want to thank all the meet-up groups and all the We Are Change and Libertarians and the Conservative Party who came out and drowned out his voice.
[00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:56.723]  Like you just said, Alex, we booed for an hour and 45 minutes straight so loud that I know he's not coming back to South Florida anytime soon.
[00:50:56.883 --> 00:50:57.403]  Stay there.
[00:50:57.644 --> 00:50:58.004]  Stay there.
[00:50:59.758 --> 00:51:03.742]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:51:03.862 --> 00:51:06.605]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:51:06.745 --> 00:51:07.986]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:51:08.006 --> 00:51:08.687]  It's very real.
[00:51:08.827 --> 00:51:10.949]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:12.590]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:17.075]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:51:17.195 --> 00:51:19.477]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:51:19.757 --> 00:51:25.559]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:51:25.779 --> 00:51:30.501]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:51:30.561 --> 00:51:33.282]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:51:33.382 --> 00:51:36.023]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:51:36.103 --> 00:51:37.463]  This system is free of chemicals.
[00:51:37.483 --> 00:51:37.923]  We're good.
[00:52:01.019 --> 00:52:04.667]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.067 --> 00:52:08.053]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:08.294 --> 00:52:09.717]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:10.416 --> 00:52:13.077]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.097 --> 00:52:19.319]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.479 --> 00:52:24.521]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.021 --> 00:52:34.644]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:36.885]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.125 --> 00:52:38.446]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:38.706 --> 00:52:41.007]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.168 --> 00:52:43.009]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:48.111]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:53.214]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:52:59.791 --> 00:53:01.433]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:53:01.554 --> 00:53:02.995]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:53:03.056 --> 00:53:04.157]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:53:04.397 --> 00:53:06.200]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:15.051]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:20.376]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:53:20.536 --> 00:53:22.157]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:53:22.337 --> 00:53:29.744]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[00:54:06.485 --> 00:54:06.625]  Liar!
[00:54:06.685 --> 00:54:07.005]  Liar!
[00:54:07.045 --> 00:54:07.285]  Liar!
[00:54:07.365 --> 00:54:07.506]  Liar!
[00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:46.336]  When the levee breaks, Al Gore will have no place to stay.
[00:54:47.157 --> 00:54:53.025]  Yeah, the oceans aren't rising, but the awakening is rising.
[00:54:53.546 --> 00:54:58.813]  The people standing up against his tyranny is rising right now.
[00:54:59.983 --> 00:55:03.565]  And the New World Order feels that rising tide of freedom.
[00:55:04.285 --> 00:55:07.867]  When the levy breaks, Al Gore and his fraud will have no place to stay.
[00:55:08.207 --> 00:55:09.268]  He's going down.
[00:55:09.288 --> 00:55:11.129]  He's going down now.
[00:55:11.389 --> 00:55:12.690]  He's going down.
[00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.411]  He's going down now.
[00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:16.472]  He's going down.
[00:55:16.832 --> 00:55:18.453]  Going down.
[00:55:18.813 --> 00:55:19.853]  Going down.
[00:55:20.174 --> 00:55:22.055]  Down to Chicago.
[00:55:25.235 --> 00:55:26.236]  Oh, how exciting.
[00:55:26.276 --> 00:55:28.897]  Okay, finishing up with We Are Change Florida.
[00:55:29.177 --> 00:55:30.998]  We're going to go to the big finale here in a moment.
[00:55:31.518 --> 00:55:34.599]  Saeed and Steve from We Are Change Chicago.
[00:55:34.619 --> 00:55:39.342]  That song's just for you, where the levy breaks in Chicago.
[00:55:40.202 --> 00:55:44.704]  Good to be talking to We Are Change Florida.
[00:55:45.565 --> 00:55:47.806]  Anything else from the folks in Florida?
[00:55:47.846 --> 00:55:50.627]  Any other points, EM, that you guys want to add?
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.503]  Yeah, a couple real quick points and then I'll let you get to Steve in Chicago.
[00:55:56.564 --> 00:56:12.918]  You know, one of the main points that I really want to point out is for those people out there who really want to do the kind of things we are changing and other groups are doing in these confrontational type of style, you know, don't worry about having an organization ready to go when you find out there's an event.
[00:56:13.518 --> 00:56:18.202]  I organized this in a matter of six days and we had hundreds of people show up.
[00:56:18.703 --> 00:56:30.473]  From a number of different groups who don't see eye-to-eye on most issues, but we did unite and it's really helping to wake up a lot of people who are kind of controlled by the... Yeah, I remember other listeners calling in.
[00:56:30.493 --> 00:56:34.577]  I don't know if that was you days before and we put a video out telling folks to go out to the event.
[00:56:34.597 --> 00:56:35.077]  Did that help?
[00:56:36.178 --> 00:56:43.284]  Yeah, that was me and it helped tremendously and that got the ball rolling and then really it's all about getting online and getting on the message boards and
[00:56:43.912 --> 00:56:51.497]  And really using meet-ups and just getting those emails out to people that are total strangers, but are aligned on the same vision.
[00:56:52.098 --> 00:57:02.605]  And, you know, one other thing, you know, the cops were pretty hardcore at that event, so we didn't get to do the kind of up-in-your-face, you know, confrontation when he was getting in his car at the end.
[00:57:03.325 --> 00:57:08.389]  But if people want to search all the videos of the Boca Raton Al Gore protest, you're going to see
[00:57:09.548 --> 00:57:13.271]  Uh, everything that we're discussing here and how big it really was.
[00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:18.315]  You did an unbelievably good job, my friend, and take care, Ian.
[00:57:18.355 --> 00:57:19.536]  We love what you're doing.
[00:57:19.556 --> 00:57:20.216]  You know what I want to do?
[00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:27.862]  I want to cue it right up to Al Gore being chased once he came out.
[00:57:28.783 --> 00:57:35.387]  I want to start the video at the end, and then before we are changed, Chicago and Ohio, leave us in about 20 minutes.
[00:57:35.668 --> 00:57:37.069]  We're coming back to him right now.
[00:57:38.476 --> 00:57:42.199]  We're gonna play the whole clip unedited of how they did it.
[00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:42.999]  They were inside.
[00:57:43.019 --> 00:57:43.760]  They were outside.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:44.580]  They were everywhere.
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:49.904]  And it made all over the news, all over the newspapers, front page of some of the papers.
[00:57:50.404 --> 00:57:53.467]  I mean, this was devastating to this scam artist.
[00:57:54.367 --> 00:58:05.651]  And in front of hundreds of his mindless drones, paying money to go be indoctrinated by him with his airbrushed fake book cover showing all these hurricanes turning the wrong direction.
[00:58:06.931 --> 00:58:19.155]  I mean, this fraud is imploding and I just want to remind listeners, here in my stack, Al Gore has now cancelled... I had it here in my stack, here it is.
[00:58:19.876 --> 00:58:23.497]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com, Gore cancels on Copenhagen Lecture
[00:58:24.775 --> 00:58:26.636]  Leaves ticket holders in a lurch.
[00:58:27.877 --> 00:58:30.138]  Holdren grilled over email controversy.
[00:58:30.178 --> 00:58:35.440]  Now he's involved in ClimateGate, the White House science czar that wants to poison your water supply to sterilize you.
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.261]  We're going to talk about it all coming up.
[00:58:37.281 --> 00:58:37.741]  Stay with us.

[00:59:12.508 --> 00:59:13.108]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:13.168 --> 00:59:14.429]  They're asking for more matches!

[01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:12.631]  No!
[01:00:31.599 --> 01:00:32.239]  Big Brother.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.940]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.761]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:36.421 --> 01:00:37.241]  You want answers?
[01:00:38.022 --> 01:00:38.922]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:38.942 --> 01:00:43.244]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:43.744 --> 01:00:47.786]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:56.073]  I've been telling you for months he's going to start cancelling all his public appearances, just like all the congressmen are doing.
[01:00:56.454 --> 01:01:04.522]  We're now publicly isolating them, showing everyone they're criminals, saying these are Madoffs, these are Ken Leys, these are criminals.
[01:01:06.946 --> 01:01:08.606]  And their collapse is beginning.
[01:01:08.626 --> 01:01:11.327]  We're going to play the start of that confrontation from inside.
[01:01:11.727 --> 01:01:18.909]  And again, that took over newspaper headlines, front of one of the major Chicago papers, top story, TV, national news.
[01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:21.750]  And that was a nice crowd of great activists.
[01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:25.271]  Those are the equivalent of our founding fathers.
[01:01:25.311 --> 01:01:26.311]  That's how it begins.
[01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:30.892]  You know what the Sons of Liberty did for 15 years before the war started?
[01:01:31.352 --> 01:01:33.273]  They did exactly what you just saw.
[01:01:33.493 --> 01:01:34.233]  Exactly!
[01:01:35.367 --> 01:01:45.791]  When the Redcoats were stealing people's property and raping people's women and beating people up, and there was police brutality, and the corrupt Lords were out of control, the Founders did that and a lot more for 15 years.
[01:01:46.811 --> 01:01:49.972]  And they woke the country up and got it ready to defeat the New World Order.
[01:01:50.512 --> 01:01:52.473]  And that's what we're doing right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:52.713 --> 01:01:55.494]  We're hoping for a peaceful outcome in this by arresting these crooks.
[01:01:56.974 --> 01:02:01.476]  I want to go to Steve and Saeed from We Are Change Chicago.
[01:02:01.516 --> 01:02:03.076]  They also work with We Are Change Ohio.
[01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:06.436]  I salute you.
[01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.057]  Do we have Anthony from Ohio, too?
[01:02:09.257 --> 01:02:09.897]  He's coming on later.
[01:02:10.278 --> 01:02:11.818]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to these guys.
[01:02:11.838 --> 01:02:13.539]  We're going to come back after the break and talk more.
[01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:15.439]  Just incredible job.
[01:02:15.459 --> 01:02:19.521]  I mean, it can't be done better than what you did in Chicago.
[01:02:20.561 --> 01:02:21.942]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:02:21.982 --> 01:02:23.943]  Really appreciate you covering it.
[01:02:24.463 --> 01:02:26.844]  We had an organized effort to confront Gore.
[01:02:27.684 --> 01:02:33.426]  We were all ready and organized and went there early in the morning, got our wristbands, and really
[01:02:33.925 --> 01:02:34.686]  You did great.
[01:02:34.786 --> 01:02:38.668]  I think we really got him on ClimateGate and thank you for covering it.
[01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:40.370]  I mean, the timing was perfect.
[01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:50.917]  You really covered it over the weekend and that Tuesday is when we were going to confront him because originally we were going to get him on 30,000 Scientists and Global Governance.
[01:02:51.357 --> 01:02:55.260]  But as soon as ClimateGate came out, we were like, we have to get him on ClimateGate.
[01:02:55.921 --> 01:03:00.944]  So we all sat down and got a plan together and just did it.
[01:03:02.577 --> 01:03:04.078]  It was great that the media covered it.
[01:03:04.979 --> 01:03:06.921]  I mean, I'll explain it to you from the beginning.
[01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:09.963]  We just marched down to the borders in the morning.
[01:03:10.423 --> 01:03:12.225]  We got our wristbands, got in okay.
[01:03:12.805 --> 01:03:15.067]  And then a couple hours later, they had the book signing.
[01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.630]  I'm in line with... We went in groups.
[01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:22.713]  It was me and Sati Ward, who's a member of Weird Change Chicago.
[01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:27.117]  Steve was a little bit behind, and Anthony was in the middle.
[01:03:27.497 --> 01:03:32.281]  We had Lee filming on the side, as you see that angle from the side angle.
[01:03:32.878 --> 01:03:34.359]  So I'm in line now.
[01:03:34.419 --> 01:03:44.682]  That reporter that you see in the beginning, he's a Fox News reporter, and he actually interviewed me before I confronted him about, hey, what are you guys doing out here?
[01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:48.484]  If you could say anything to Al Gore, what would you say to him?
[01:03:49.264 --> 01:03:58.848]  And I said it straight up that I want to ask him about climate change, about these letters and documents that have been hacked that represent and show that he's been manipulating the people.
[01:04:00.845 --> 01:04:02.745]  What's going on about it?
[01:04:02.865 --> 01:04:06.386]  There's so much coming out to prove that this is a hoax.
[01:04:07.266 --> 01:04:12.207]  And he kind of like, the reporter kind of like stuttered and kind of just walked off like, okay.
[01:04:12.727 --> 01:04:14.168]  He was expecting something, so.
[01:04:16.268 --> 01:04:18.149]  And then he also interviewed Anthony.
[01:04:18.189 --> 01:04:19.429]  I'll let Anthony explain that.
[01:04:20.009 --> 01:04:21.269]  We went up to confront him.
[01:04:21.509 --> 01:04:26.110]  I asked him on, if he could talk about Climbing Against a Cliff.
[01:04:28.091 --> 01:04:29.351]  He responded by saying,
[01:04:29.958 --> 01:04:31.119]  I haven't read the emails.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.223]  And I mean, this coward, this globalist, I mean, that's what he really is.
[01:04:36.503 --> 01:04:37.764]  Well, stay there, stay there.
[01:04:38.865 --> 01:04:45.390]  We got Syed, we've got Steve from Chicago, Anthony coming up, and we're going to play the video from the start.
[01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:46.951]  It is dynamic stuff.
[01:04:47.531 --> 01:04:48.792]  This is how it's done.
[01:04:49.372 --> 01:04:52.375]  And I can only salute everyone who's involved.
[01:04:52.415 --> 01:04:53.836]  And it's only intensifying.
[01:04:53.876 --> 01:04:57.659]  And now he's canceling his events, which we don't want him to do.
[01:04:57.679 --> 01:04:58.820]  We want to go out and confront him more.
[01:04:59.878 --> 01:05:02.479]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:02.879 --> 01:05:07.840]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.940]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:15.061]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:15.262 --> 01:05:16.222]  How much do you want?
[01:05:16.442 --> 01:05:17.182]  When do you want it?
[01:05:17.562 --> 01:05:19.162]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:19.443 --> 01:05:20.263]  When will you need it?
[01:05:20.523 --> 01:05:22.583]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:22.723 --> 01:05:23.824]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:24.064 --> 01:05:25.404]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:25.584 --> 01:05:25.944]  If there's a
[01:05:26.004 --> 01:05:27.966]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:05:28.126 --> 01:05:30.648]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:30.848 --> 01:05:34.050]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:37.933]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:38.253 --> 01:05:39.254]  How much will you need?
[01:05:39.494 --> 01:05:40.095]  We don't know.
[01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:41.296]  How much do you want?
[01:05:41.496 --> 01:05:42.216]  All you can get.
[01:05:42.236 --> 01:05:42.817]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:43.497 --> 01:05:46.282]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:02.882]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:06:03.002 --> 01:06:05.743]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:06:05.883 --> 01:06:07.124]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:06:07.144 --> 01:06:07.824]  It's very real.
[01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.085]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:06:10.206 --> 01:06:11.726]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:08:00.672 --> 01:08:06.256]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.478 --> 01:08:15.546]  We're talking to Saad and Steve from We Are Change, one of dozens of great activists out there, leading the charge successfully against Al Gore.
[01:08:15.986 --> 01:08:22.232]  And the first time you go to a public event, a book signing, a press conference, you can go up politely and talk to them.
[01:08:22.252 --> 01:08:23.253]  They'll try to throw you out.
[01:08:23.773 --> 01:08:25.234]  Then you take over the media coverage.
[01:08:25.495 --> 01:08:27.156]  Then you can yell when they're dragging you out.
[01:08:27.697 --> 01:08:29.278]  You can start yelling from the start.
[01:08:29.799 --> 01:08:31.100]  I like the way they did it.
[01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:37.825]  Well, they tried to be nice at first, talked to the media, got that coverage, then tried to talk to him and they got thrown out.
[01:08:37.905 --> 01:08:40.747]  Then they started yelling key, simple facts.
[01:08:41.328 --> 01:08:51.335]  People criticize me, like when I have gone and taken over Chris Matthews' TV coverage at, say, the DNC, because I kept saying, 9-11's an inside job, 9-11's an inside job.
[01:08:51.956 --> 01:08:57.760]  If I started quoting the Declaration of Independence, it wouldn't make it across TV over Chris Matthews talking.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.922]  But if you say simple slogans,
[01:09:01.377 --> 01:09:20.899]  Then they start ignoring what the teleprompter readers are saying, and they hear you rhythmically repeating, 9-11's an inside job, 9-11's an inside job, InfoWars.com, WeAreChange.org, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:25.750]  Now people everywhere they go are confronting him.
[01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:30.932]  And then they physically attack me and cut up my megaphone, and it's the extra on the Obama deception.
[01:09:30.952 --> 01:09:31.672]  People haven't seen it.
[01:09:32.433 --> 01:09:34.153]  But then other people are going out and doing it.
[01:09:35.074 --> 01:09:40.276]  I remember they were having a fake bioweapon release with the state police to scare the locals in Austin.
[01:09:40.656 --> 01:09:43.317]  I just went down, jumped in front of the live newscast, said it's all fake.
[01:09:43.897 --> 01:09:46.318]  I called the TV station and said, we're going to announce it's fake.
[01:09:46.398 --> 01:09:47.099]  We have proof.
[01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:53.806]  Because I did have the proof from an internal source, but that bluffed them because I couldn't give the source up to going on and announcing it was fake.
[01:09:54.887 --> 01:09:58.552]  They had a fake nuclear spill we knew was fake and a drill for the Army taking over.
[01:09:58.932 --> 01:10:00.574]  We bluffed them into doing that.
[01:10:00.914 --> 01:10:02.837]  You prove the fraud they're running.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:04.700]  By exposing them.
[01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:07.001]  Now I want to just play the clip from the start.
[01:10:07.762 --> 01:10:09.483]  And it starts with the newscast that gets into the clip.
[01:10:09.503 --> 01:10:17.206]  We're going to go back to Saad and Steve and others and give you their websites and tell you how you can get involved or start your own group.
[01:10:17.226 --> 01:10:18.166]  I think the more the merrier.
[01:10:18.486 --> 01:10:19.167]  Join this group.
[01:10:19.187 --> 01:10:19.947]  Start another group.
[01:10:20.527 --> 01:10:26.850]  We're lone wolf in that we love the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution, but we're thousands of groups.
[01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:29.912]  That's why people have asked me to form my own groups or lead groups.
[01:10:30.072 --> 01:10:30.492]  Uh-uh.
[01:10:31.212 --> 01:10:31.693]  No.
[01:10:32.153 --> 01:10:34.415]  See, that's a centralized system.
[01:10:35.156 --> 01:10:38.359]  Our idea is centralized, of freedom and truth and justice.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.901]  And it cuts across party lines.
[01:10:41.282 --> 01:10:42.383]  We expose phony wars.
[01:10:42.423 --> 01:10:43.044]  We expose 9-11.
[01:10:43.624 --> 01:10:45.106]  We expose the global warming fraud.
[01:10:45.126 --> 01:10:47.488]  We expose, the heart of it, the eugenics system.
[01:10:47.728 --> 01:10:48.869]  But let's play this clip.
[01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:51.432]  This is how it's done.
[01:10:51.972 --> 01:10:55.914]  And it took courage, but once you've done it once, you're not afraid to do it anymore.
[01:10:55.994 --> 01:11:00.496]  So take the plunge, join the rebellion peacefully, take over their events.
[01:11:00.536 --> 01:11:00.996]  Here it is.
[01:11:01.016 --> 01:11:04.058]  Governor Davis signed copies of his new book, Our Choice.
[01:11:04.078 --> 01:11:07.699]  There was a long line of supporters at the Borders bookstore on State Street.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:13.042]  Our Choice is a follow-up to the Borders Academy Award-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.
[01:11:13.542 --> 01:11:16.484]  Gore has championed environmental issues for many years.
[01:11:16.784 --> 01:11:21.546]  His book is described as a call to action and answers many of the questions posed by the film.
[01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:27.009]  Gore was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work with climate change.
[01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:30.671]  They're in the bookstore.
[01:11:31.232 --> 01:11:32.773]  The Slimer walks by.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.523]  Sir, can you comment on the, uh, you know, the documents that were, uh, revealed, uh, at, uh, at ClimateGate?
[01:11:43.543 --> 01:11:44.644]  ClimateGate?
[01:11:44.824 --> 01:11:48.006]  They said that their research is a fraud and it's not implemented.
[01:11:48.026 --> 01:11:49.106]  Can you give a comment?
[01:11:49.126 --> 01:11:50.487]  Can you give me a comment, sir?
[01:11:50.547 --> 01:11:51.348]  You're a fraud!
[01:11:51.368 --> 01:11:54.089]  This is a New World Order eugenics operation!
[01:11:54.129 --> 01:11:54.709]  Don't touch me!
[01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:57.171]  This is a eugenics operation!
[01:11:57.251 --> 01:11:59.552]  One more time, I'm trying to sue Al Gore!
[01:11:59.632 --> 01:12:00.013]  Look it up!
[01:12:00.033 --> 01:12:01.073]  This is a eugenics program!
[01:12:01.093 --> 01:12:02.374]  This is a New World Order!
[01:12:04.156 --> 01:12:10.822]  Can I give you that, Mr. Gloria?
[01:12:10.842 --> 01:12:17.209]  It's the science that shows that 31,000 scientists are speaking out against your eugenics club of Rome agenda, sir.
[01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:22.014]  We will fail, and we realize that this is against our sovereignty.
[01:12:22.154 --> 01:12:23.295]  I have a First Amendment right.
[01:12:23.315 --> 01:12:25.077]  You do not need to assault me, sir.
[01:12:25.157 --> 01:12:25.758]  I am leaving.
[01:12:26.138 --> 01:12:26.679]  I am leaving.
[01:12:26.739 --> 01:12:28.341]  You do not need to assault me, sir.
[01:12:28.601 --> 01:12:30.063]  I have a First Amendment right!
[01:12:30.603 --> 01:12:34.107]  This man wants to create a centralized global government!
[01:12:34.127 --> 01:12:35.669]  31,000 scientists.
[01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:38.472]  That man is... This is Nazi fascism!
[01:12:38.792 --> 01:12:39.413]  Who are you?
[01:12:40.416 --> 01:12:41.837]  Any comments on ClimateGate?
[01:12:42.097 --> 01:12:44.939]  The emails that prove it's a scam, it's a farce.
[01:12:45.359 --> 01:12:46.520]  Global warming is a joke.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.580]  Any comment?
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:48.781]  Comment on ClimateGate?
[01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:51.002]  ClimateGate, First Amendment rights here.
[01:12:51.062 --> 01:12:51.803]  ClimateGate!
[01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:53.103]  ClimateGate!
[01:12:53.504 --> 01:12:54.905]  Research ClimateGate!
[01:12:54.945 --> 01:12:56.165]  This guy's a fraud!
[01:12:56.225 --> 01:12:57.026]  It's a scam!
[01:12:57.686 --> 01:13:02.189]  They are trying to institute a global government through a carbon tax!
[01:13:02.569 --> 01:13:04.590]  This guy's working on a carbon tax!
[01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:05.490]  That's all it is!
[01:13:05.851 --> 01:13:06.951]  It's global government!
[01:13:07.251 --> 01:13:10.413]  There are 30,000 scientists trying to sue this guy!
[01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:14.775]  John Coleman, the founder of the Weather Channel, is suing this bum!
[01:13:15.176 --> 01:13:17.557]  You're out of line for this bum!
[01:13:17.837 --> 01:13:19.038]  It's a global government!
[01:13:19.058 --> 01:13:20.078]  Get your hands off me!
[01:13:20.358 --> 01:13:21.359]  First Amendment rights!
[01:13:21.639 --> 01:13:22.560]  Get your hands off me!
[01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:26.949]  Talk about carbon polluters.
[01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:27.689]  You talk about them.
[01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:40.839]  It's my understanding that back in 1997, when you were Vice President, Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.961]  Is that accurate?
[01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:43.682]  Is it inaccurate?
[01:13:43.802 --> 01:13:44.742]  It's been reported.
[01:13:47.504 --> 01:13:47.925]  I don't know.
[01:13:51.974 --> 01:13:53.015]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:53.475 --> 01:13:55.616]  And it goes on from there with them confronting him outside.
[01:13:55.676 --> 01:14:02.159]  But the point is, they split up so that as each one got thrown out, another one then activates.
[01:14:02.419 --> 01:14:03.379]  And it panics them.
[01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:04.500]  One, they can handle.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.440]  Two, they don't like.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:06.500]  Three, they go crazy.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.841]  Four, they start freaking.
[01:14:08.081 --> 01:14:09.182]  Five, they go nuts.
[01:14:09.562 --> 01:14:11.783]  Six, Al Gore cancels everything!
[01:14:13.263 --> 01:14:15.064]  Which really is what they have to do.
[01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:20.927]  Because if he keeps going out, all the headlines are about how he's a fraud, how he's making money, how it's eugenics.
[01:14:21.863 --> 01:14:23.724]  And so he's cancelling these events.
[01:14:24.264 --> 01:14:25.745]  And at first he took them off his website.
[01:14:26.105 --> 01:14:27.105]  Now he's cancelling them.
[01:14:27.626 --> 01:14:30.867]  Because he knows if he goes out, we take his media attention away from him.
[01:14:31.047 --> 01:14:34.769]  He'll now watch, start phasing out his events, as he's doing.
[01:14:34.809 --> 01:14:38.591]  I told you he would do this, because I understand this warfare system that they've been using against it.
[01:14:39.591 --> 01:14:40.011]  Against us.
[01:14:40.051 --> 01:14:41.832]  We're now countering them with our own system.
[01:14:42.673 --> 01:14:47.535]  Which I literally just stumbled on myself through trial and error trying to go to press conferences and ask real questions.
[01:14:48.413 --> 01:14:51.537]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, this is the true activism.
[01:14:51.577 --> 01:14:59.066]  This is a million times more effective than mass protests where the cops come and have a provocateur throw a bottle at them so the cops then attack everybody.
[01:14:59.086 --> 01:15:03.412]  And I'm not saying don't have protests, but this is the way that they can't stop you.
[01:15:03.452 --> 01:15:04.513]  And it's not just Al Gore.
[01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:13.521]  Saad, going back to Steve, you guys, again, everybody there, give us the We Are Change Chicago website.
[01:15:14.081 --> 01:15:15.603]  Who else are you going to be out confronting?
[01:15:15.623 --> 01:15:17.004]  What other street actions are you doing?
[01:15:17.244 --> 01:15:19.666]  Finish up talking about the incredible job you did.
[01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:26.973]  Well, everybody out there, just please join us by going to WeAreChangedChicago.com and you will see a section where you can join us.
[01:15:27.373 --> 01:15:39.461]  We have a weekly street action that we do every Sunday, usually at the Art Institute or the Belmont Clark neighborhood, because we're trying to extend all around the city and have a weekly thing where everybody can come out and be active once a week.
[01:15:40.062 --> 01:15:44.444]  And as for confrontations, we're planning where we have come up for confrontations.
[01:15:45.005 --> 01:15:45.885]  We have a U.N.
[01:15:45.905 --> 01:15:48.407]  ambassador to the United Nations coming up.
[01:15:49.474 --> 01:15:52.395]  Anybody that's in Chicago, please get a hold of We Are Change Chicago.
[01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:56.456]  Go to the website, join up, and join us in these conversations, because there's strength in numbers.
[01:15:56.816 --> 01:16:06.938]  If we take 50 people out to these book signings, we can totally just ask him as many questions as we want, and until he can't even take it over and walks away.
[01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:10.758]  Now, we know, we know, let me just real quick, because we're going to just keep going.
[01:16:10.778 --> 01:16:13.399]  We've got Luke Radowsky on as well, and Anthony and others coming up.
[01:16:14.383 --> 01:16:17.304]  We know that he's canceling most of his events.
[01:16:17.344 --> 01:16:20.264]  Have we been able to find out where this criminal is going to be next?
[01:16:21.105 --> 01:16:23.805]  Well, we know that he's going to be in Chicago again.
[01:16:23.985 --> 01:16:25.266]  I believe it's in March.
[01:16:25.386 --> 01:16:27.566]  Anthony knows a little bit better about that, but he might be here.
[01:16:27.606 --> 01:16:28.606]  I think it's March or May.
[01:16:28.967 --> 01:16:30.447]  He's going to be here again in Chicago.
[01:16:31.127 --> 01:16:35.368]  But if you just got to really go dig in and do some research, you'll find where he's going to be.
[01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:37.269]  I'll be looking myself.
[01:16:37.289 --> 01:16:38.749]  If I see anything, I'll shoot it to any of you.
[01:16:40.465 --> 01:16:46.289]  Yeah, because they're only doing local coverage to keep us from learning on purpose before they were promoted everywhere.
[01:16:46.689 --> 01:16:48.650]  We need listeners who are everywhere in the country.
[01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:51.232]  You've heard it announced where he's coming in your area.
[01:16:52.173 --> 01:16:56.396]  Tell everybody on your email list, get it out, so we can start tracking this criminal.
[01:16:57.116 --> 01:17:02.560]  Now again, Assad and Steve, who hasn't had a chance to talk yet?
[01:17:05.062 --> 01:17:05.562]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:17:06.547 --> 01:17:08.749]  Well, I just want to say it's great that you're covering this.
[01:17:08.769 --> 01:17:10.891]  You're waking people up and it's infectious.
[01:17:10.931 --> 01:17:15.354]  Just yesterday, we had the Afghan impromptu war protest at Federal Plaza.
[01:17:15.755 --> 01:17:19.878]  People saw our We Are Change Chicago banner and they were like, we saw it on InfoWars.
[01:17:19.898 --> 01:17:20.399]  We saw it.
[01:17:20.439 --> 01:17:22.801]  We didn't know we had a chapter and now we know.
[01:17:23.221 --> 01:17:24.162]  So everybody out there,
[01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:27.305]  Stop waiting for orders to get active.
[01:17:27.365 --> 01:17:28.246]  Just go find it.
[01:17:28.287 --> 01:17:28.927]  Find a group.
[01:17:28.947 --> 01:17:29.628]  Start your own.
[01:17:30.069 --> 01:17:34.133]  Because me and Todd are just two guys that met because we had the same belief system.
[01:17:34.153 --> 01:17:35.135]  We knew we could do this.
[01:17:35.455 --> 01:17:36.596]  We knew we could take it over.
[01:17:36.977 --> 01:17:38.158]  We got the press coverage.
[01:17:38.178 --> 01:17:39.179]  We got the attention.
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:40.801]  Fox News called us.
[01:17:40.841 --> 01:17:43.104]  They wanted to have us on to cover this thing.
[01:17:44.205 --> 01:17:59.157]  We understand that we can take this over and I think the media, there are people out there waking up in the media because when WBBM reported on the Al Gore event, they said in their own broadcast that everybody in line with the book was allowed time with Al Gore except the media.
[01:17:59.895 --> 01:18:07.842]  So I think one of the big reasons we were able to get them on our side and actually cover us was I think they were just as angry as well for being shunned from Al Gore.
[01:18:08.182 --> 01:18:11.364]  And that's why everyone should be really upset, is there's no... Exactly.
[01:18:11.425 --> 01:18:12.265]  Look, look, look.
[01:18:12.325 --> 01:18:16.589]  The average media person, the average cop, the average bureaucrat, they're just like us.
[01:18:16.649 --> 01:18:18.911]  They were told we were all kooks a decade ago.
[01:18:19.291 --> 01:18:21.253]  Now everything we talked about came true.
[01:18:21.513 --> 01:18:22.954]  They're all joining us now.
[01:18:23.294 --> 01:18:27.458]  This is how revolutions are won without firing a shot.
[01:18:28.699 --> 01:18:28.919]  Exactly.
[01:18:30.086 --> 01:18:31.907]  I want to make one last point real quick.
[01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:37.011]  As we were shouting and leaving, the media left Gore and followed us outside.
[01:18:38.392 --> 01:18:41.595]  When we were outside, we were actually talking.
[01:18:41.615 --> 01:18:45.898]  We didn't put this in the video, but we were actually giving a speech to all the media.
[01:18:46.038 --> 01:18:50.141]  There were cameras, and all the people, the programmed Gorians who were walking out of
[01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:58.182]  That bookstore was sitting there listening to us and asking us, wow, we didn't know this, where can I get more information on how, where is climate change, what is it?
[01:18:58.222 --> 01:19:07.832]  So we're sitting there explaining to like over 50 people how everything, and including... Well you need to post that video now as part two so millions can see it, but what's happening is...
[01:19:08.633 --> 01:19:15.418]  Again, they're having to not come out and have their events because they know it's a catalyst for the truth-tellers to go out and counter their lies.
[01:19:15.698 --> 01:19:19.621]  They're hoping we just dissipate and go away, but Climategate isn't going away.
[01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:23.464]  Two weeks ago when this came out, we got the equivalent of the Death Star plans.
[01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:28.187]  In the last couple days, the Death Star blew up, but the Empire is still there.
[01:19:28.407 --> 01:19:36.013]  But literally, ladies and gentlemen, with the Audit the Fed bill going forward, talk of blocking the re-confirmation of Bernanke, with
[01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:39.855]  Climategate in trouble with all these professors getting in trouble.
[01:19:40.095 --> 01:19:45.079]  The cap-and-trade bill failing that was going to pass in Australia.
[01:19:45.399 --> 01:19:47.400]  The Death Star blew up.
[01:19:47.861 --> 01:19:51.223]  I mean, we just blew up one of their biggest operations.
[01:19:51.323 --> 01:19:52.204]  It is in tatters.
[01:19:52.464 --> 01:19:55.166]  They're still going to operate covertly locally.
[01:19:55.486 --> 01:19:58.628]  I want to bring you guys up with Luke Hradowski and others straight ahead.
[01:20:00.913 --> 01:20:05.135]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[01:20:05.415 --> 01:20:09.477]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Siaga.
[01:20:09.697 --> 01:20:20.102]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[01:20:26.186 --> 01:20:26.826]  We're good to go.
[01:20:44.735 --> 01:20:46.896]  1-877-HEAL-4-GOOD.
[01:20:46.916 --> 01:20:50.519]  1-877-HEAL-4-GOOD.
[01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.439]  That's 877-432-5446.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:57.383]  Or order online at heal4good.com.
[01:20:57.523 --> 01:20:59.785]  That's heal4good.com.
[01:21:02.126 --> 01:21:05.769]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:06.129 --> 01:21:09.171]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.391 --> 01:21:10.792]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:21:11.691 --> 01:21:14.152]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.172 --> 01:21:20.375]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.555 --> 01:21:25.597]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:25.757 --> 01:21:35.722]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.842 --> 01:21:37.963]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.203 --> 01:21:39.523]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.783 --> 01:21:42.064]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.244 --> 01:21:44.104]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.364 --> 01:21:49.166]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:49.526 --> 01:21:58.629]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:03.584]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:04.005 --> 01:22:09.470]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:10.551]  That's right.
[01:22:10.871 --> 01:22:13.153]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:22:13.714 --> 01:22:20.641]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:22:21.201 --> 01:22:28.883]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:29.323 --> 01:22:34.184]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:22:34.805 --> 01:22:37.825]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:40.606 --> 01:22:44.728]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:22:45.128 --> 01:22:45.388]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.408 --> 01:22:47.309]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:22:47.389 --> 01:22:47.709]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.989 --> 01:22:48.269]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.369 --> 01:22:49.529]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[01:22:49.569 --> 01:22:52.090]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:11.241]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:16.903]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[01:23:17.543 --> 01:23:19.983]  Patriotfood.com.
[01:23:20.003 --> 01:23:24.445]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[01:23:25.105 --> 01:23:29.846]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[01:23:30.868 --> 01:23:36.731]  And SurvivalistSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[01:23:37.231 --> 01:23:40.853]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[01:23:41.273 --> 01:23:47.116]  That's over four pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:51.478]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[01:23:51.979 --> 01:23:55.760]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:23:56.301 --> 01:23:58.842]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[01:24:02.586 --> 01:24:05.968]  Alright, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:21.308 --> 01:24:31.773]  This is, this is, ladies and gentlemen, bottom line, this is bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, the equivalent of the Death Star.
[01:24:31.813 --> 01:24:41.437]  This is their grid, their world government, to train everybody to have our resources cut off to kill the third world and turn us into an absolute third world slum ourselves.
[01:24:41.937 --> 01:24:47.880]  This is the plan to use economic tyranny to make us be so poor we can't stand up against them.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.221]  Governments have always used
[01:24:49.921 --> 01:24:52.325]  Poverty as a tool of control.
[01:24:53.248 --> 01:25:00.409]  Now, going back to my guest, because we've got We Are Change founder Luke Rudowsky on the line.
[01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:01.430]  I meant to get Luke on.
[01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:02.730]  Somehow that fell through the cracks.
[01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:04.050]  I'm glad we were able to get a hold of him.
[01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:13.152]  Luke, I want to get Anthony on from Ohio, who was involved with Chicago, who may have discovered the location of the Snake's next event, Hair Gore.
[01:25:13.752 --> 01:25:22.774]  But expanding on this, Luke, what is it like to see just the people rising and taking over the media attention and literally running
[01:25:25.257 --> 01:25:30.063]  I mean, it's incredible seeing the true authority and power we all have in ourselves.
[01:25:30.423 --> 01:25:35.850]  And it's us realizing that power that is really going to take back this country and take back our lives.
[01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:37.272]  Our lives have meaning.
[01:25:37.593 --> 01:25:40.076]  We are something in this world and we're going to make something happen.
[01:25:40.587 --> 01:25:43.549]  And I just published an article on Russia Today just talking about this.
[01:25:43.629 --> 01:25:48.671]  The new dawn of a new age of muckraking is upon us, and we are taking advantage.
[01:25:48.732 --> 01:25:54.915]  We are taking the airwaves away from these corporations, and we are speaking truth to power to everybody.
[01:25:55.255 --> 01:26:01.138]  And the more we keep doing this, the more everybody's going to see the real truth behind everything.
[01:26:01.178 --> 01:26:03.780]  Global warming, 9-11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:09.803]  We are doing the job of the mainstream media, and people are seeing that, and we are going to be successful.
[01:26:10.376 --> 01:26:16.000]  I'll tell you, didn't Chicago do a splendid, precision job the way they worked Gore over?
[01:26:16.741 --> 01:26:18.082]  I love Chicago.
[01:26:18.122 --> 01:26:23.186]  Shout-out to also Colorado, who confronted Al Gore, ripped up his book in the book signing.
[01:26:23.546 --> 01:26:29.571]  But also here in New York City, I have to shout-out Danny Penzella, Matt LePasic, and Hebel Lemastro here in New York.
[01:26:29.891 --> 01:26:31.432]  They confronted Al Gore, too.
[01:26:31.832 --> 01:26:33.494]  I'm going to be working on that video today.
[01:26:33.914 --> 01:26:39.038]  And just like, you know, Matt LePasic just came up to him and said, aren't the ice glaciers melting on other planets as well?
[01:26:39.454 --> 01:26:44.416]  They literally grabbed him, threw him away, and then the same thing that Chicago did, screamed.
[01:26:44.456 --> 01:26:47.878]  I mean, the technique that we have is impenetrable.
[01:26:47.938 --> 01:26:53.681]  What we're doing, what Chicago and Colorado and all these wonderful, beautiful people are doing, it cannot be stopped.
[01:26:53.721 --> 01:26:57.683]  We are doing this non-violently, peacefully, taking over the airways.
[01:26:57.723 --> 01:26:59.303]  And it's beautiful and it's amazing.
[01:26:59.683 --> 01:27:04.686]  And I'm so proud of seeing so many other people just standing up for themselves and doing the right thing.
[01:27:05.287 --> 01:27:11.791]  Do you agree with my analogy that two weeks ago we got the Death Star plans and the last two or three days the Death Star blew up?
[01:27:11.891 --> 01:27:19.195]  I mean, literally, their man-made global warming fraud is imploding in flames right now.
[01:27:19.995 --> 01:27:21.556]  Yes, we have the information.
[01:27:21.776 --> 01:27:22.797]  We have the knowledge.
[01:27:22.857 --> 01:27:25.078]  But that knowledge is nothing unless we use it.
[01:27:25.339 --> 01:27:27.280]  That knowledge is power and authority.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.561]  We now have to use that power and authority.
[01:27:29.949 --> 01:27:35.376]  To tell the people what's really happening, to save this country from the Cap-and-Trade Bill, from the Copenhagen Treaty.
[01:27:35.676 --> 01:27:38.339]  We have to understand, we have to act and activate right now.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.964]  Information and knowledge is nothing unless we act on it.
[01:27:43.081 --> 01:27:43.702]  Absolutely.
[01:27:43.782 --> 01:27:44.743]  Now is the time.
[01:27:44.823 --> 01:27:46.184]  I had Lord Monckton on last week.
[01:27:46.204 --> 01:27:48.887]  He'll be reporting for us next week from Copenhagen.
[01:27:48.907 --> 01:27:50.469]  And I said, we're two minutes to midnight.
[01:27:50.489 --> 01:27:52.771]  He said, no, we're two seconds to midnight.
[01:27:53.452 --> 01:27:55.054]  But again, it's the due sex.
[01:27:55.294 --> 01:28:00.900]  Right at that moment, all these good people we don't even know about are coming out of the woodwork to aid us.
[01:28:01.721 --> 01:28:02.702]  And that's how it works.
[01:28:02.742 --> 01:28:03.903]  You take the step of faith.
[01:28:04.183 --> 01:28:05.204]  You stand up for truth.
[01:28:05.845 --> 01:28:10.848]  And you're not going to have victory overnight, but then empires just collapse in front of you.
[01:28:10.948 --> 01:28:16.931]  And I am seeing the New World Order, right as it announces itself, being blown into pieces.
[01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:21.593]  And it doesn't mean just because we've blown up the Death Star, ladies and gentlemen, the fight continues.
[01:28:21.933 --> 01:28:23.314]  The Empire is still in control.
[01:28:23.754 --> 01:28:28.016]  But this is a major coup against them, a major morale booster.
[01:28:28.396 --> 01:28:35.040]  And if we continue to get ClimateGate out, that has tentacles into all the other eugenics frauds, point out what monsters these are,
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:36.741]  We can defeat them.
[01:28:38.782 --> 01:28:40.303]  I mean, it's in our hands.
[01:28:40.363 --> 01:28:42.265]  I mean, we can defeat them.
[01:28:42.305 --> 01:28:44.486]  We can win as long as we want to win.
[01:28:44.526 --> 01:28:47.468]  And we could realize we could win just by all standing up.
[01:28:47.508 --> 01:28:50.991]  And you don't have to be a part of We Are Change or any other even group out there.
[01:28:51.311 --> 01:28:52.231]  Be an individual.
[01:28:52.572 --> 01:28:53.452]  I'm not no leader.
[01:28:53.612 --> 01:28:55.814]  People always come up to me and say I'm the organizer.
[01:28:55.874 --> 01:28:56.174]  I'm not.
[01:28:56.474 --> 01:28:57.615]  I'm just one human being.
[01:28:57.715 --> 01:28:58.916]  I can inspire people.
[01:28:59.229 --> 01:29:04.292]  But it's really up to an individual to be their own leaders and to stand up in their cities and towns.
[01:29:04.612 --> 01:29:06.133]  And that's how we're going to be successful.
[01:29:06.393 --> 01:29:10.896]  And we slowly are becoming successful because people like Saad are coming up in Chicago.
[01:29:10.936 --> 01:29:13.117]  People like Anthony are coming up in Ohio.
[01:29:13.457 --> 01:29:15.999]  You know, people like Jonathan in Colorado are coming up.
[01:29:16.039 --> 01:29:23.703]  People like Matt here in New York City are coming up and they're doing the job of mainstream media and they're standing up for themselves, for their lives, for humanity.
[01:29:24.023 --> 01:29:25.244]  And it's us standing up.
[01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:27.854]  We're on the march.
[01:29:28.295 --> 01:29:30.116]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.468 --> 01:29:56.230]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.091 --> 01:30:04.274]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:04.394 --> 01:30:08.796]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:10.777]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.322]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:31:10.542 --> 01:31:16.125]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:31:16.425 --> 01:31:20.906]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:31:21.186 --> 01:31:24.227]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:31:24.807 --> 01:31:29.228]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:31:29.628 --> 01:31:35.929]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.

[01:31:38.630 --> 01:31:41.452]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.

[01:31:48.856 --> 01:31:49.056]  Don't wait.
[01:31:49.096 --> 01:31:49.577]  Call today.
[01:31:59.687 --> 01:32:02.309]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:07.673]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:08.034 --> 01:32:09.775]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:10.075 --> 01:32:14.899]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:15.079 --> 01:32:16.040]  How much do you want?
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:17.001]  When do you want it?
[01:32:17.401 --> 01:32:18.983]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:19.283 --> 01:32:20.103]  When will you need it?
[01:32:20.344 --> 01:32:22.405]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:22.545 --> 01:32:23.646]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:23.886 --> 01:32:25.228]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:25.428 --> 01:32:25.788]  If there's a
[01:32:25.828 --> 01:32:27.790]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:30.473]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:30.673 --> 01:32:33.876]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:37.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:38.081 --> 01:32:39.062]  How much will you need?
[01:32:39.302 --> 01:32:39.923]  We don't know.
[01:32:40.203 --> 01:32:41.124]  How much do you want?
[01:32:41.324 --> 01:32:42.045]  All you can get.
[01:32:42.245 --> 01:32:42.946]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:43.326 --> 01:32:46.089]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:46.369 --> 01:32:48.571]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:48.611 --> 01:32:49.792]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:49.812 --> 01:32:53.496]  They railed against the crown, another ragtag band declaring independence.
[01:33:08.508 --> 01:33:11.010]  And here's to the renegades.
[01:33:11.050 --> 01:33:13.332]  Because of them, we're free today.
[01:33:13.912 --> 01:33:14.353]  For liberty.
[01:33:14.393 --> 01:33:16.214]  For their descendants.
[01:33:16.614 --> 01:33:17.295]  That's us.
[01:33:17.355 --> 01:33:18.596]  We're free today.
[01:33:37.766 --> 01:33:39.295]  We're free today!
[01:33:44.056 --> 01:33:45.977]  Thank God for the renegades.
[01:33:46.998 --> 01:33:49.759]  All right, let's go back to We Are Change.
[01:33:49.919 --> 01:33:51.320]  Luke, you got a big event.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.341]  I'm going to say bye to Chicago, say hi to Ohio, and I got to move to other issues.
[01:33:54.381 --> 01:33:58.043]  I appreciate you all coming on this week on short notice for the important work.
[01:33:58.663 --> 01:34:07.908]  The big mothership, the founding chapter in New York City and Manhattan, is going to have a big demonstration against the Copenhagen fraud.
[01:34:08.228 --> 01:34:10.329]  Give us the coordinates of that resistance point.
[01:34:11.041 --> 01:34:23.777]  Yeah, we're going to be having an event, an educational event, this Saturday, 56 Walker Street, 7 o'clock, about the Copenhagen Treaty, what can we do to stop it, information about it, and we're going to be teaching people how to be activist journalists.
[01:34:24.153 --> 01:34:28.796]  How to lobby against the Copenhagen Treaty and how to be effective members of this community.
[01:34:29.076 --> 01:34:31.677]  We're also going to have on WeAreChange.org a news tip section.
[01:34:31.757 --> 01:34:34.959]  If you know where these guys are, where they're doing events, please let us know.
[01:34:35.039 --> 01:34:41.123]  We will go out there, whether it's in Chicago, Ohio, Colorado, Los Angeles, we will be there confronting these guys.
[01:34:41.443 --> 01:34:43.924]  But we need you to let us know where these guys are.
[01:34:43.984 --> 01:34:44.945]  So please let us know.
[01:34:45.265 --> 01:34:46.445]  It's wearechange.org.
[01:34:46.845 --> 01:34:51.568]  And I want to thank everybody so much from the bottom of my heart for taking action every single where.
[01:34:51.808 --> 01:34:53.849]  And you don't have to be a part of We Are Change to do it.
[01:34:54.069 --> 01:34:55.229]  It's about being an individual.
[01:34:55.249 --> 01:34:56.110]  It's about being a leader.
[01:34:56.130 --> 01:34:57.010]  And God bless you all.
[01:34:57.882 --> 01:34:58.783]  Thank you so much, Luke.
[01:34:58.823 --> 01:34:59.424]  Great job.
[01:35:00.926 --> 01:35:10.857]  Going back just briefly, and I'm going to say bye to Anthony here, introduce him quickly, get a few comments from him with Ohio also doing yeoman's work, confronting military checkpoints, you name it.
[01:35:10.877 --> 01:35:12.138]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[01:35:12.158 --> 01:35:13.099]  The tyranny we're facing.
[01:35:13.459 --> 01:35:15.702]  Sod and Steve from Chicago.
[01:35:15.762 --> 01:35:16.543]  Closing comments.
[01:35:18.434 --> 01:35:27.957]  We just want to say thanks for covering us and thanks for firing people up because if it wasn't for your show and your listeners and creating this movement, there'd be nothing for us to keep moving forward.
[01:35:28.117 --> 01:35:33.158]  So, we're going to keep the ball rolling in Chicago and anyone that wants to join up, wearechangedchicago.com.
[01:35:33.458 --> 01:35:35.279]  On behalf of me, thank you Alex for everything.
[01:35:35.359 --> 01:35:36.439]  Thanks for all the info.
[01:35:36.559 --> 01:35:39.880]  InfoWars.com, wearechangedchicago.com, wearechanged.org.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.860]  Those are the websites.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.301]  Everybody get active.
[01:35:42.341 --> 01:35:44.301]  Let us know if you want to appear in Chicago.
[01:35:44.401 --> 01:35:47.442]  Come and join us and we'll fight the fight together.
[01:35:48.551 --> 01:35:49.912]  Absolutely, God bless you.
[01:35:50.532 --> 01:35:51.672]  Wow, so exciting.
[01:35:51.852 --> 01:35:59.395]  And it's just so wonderful to see America standing up and the people of the planet standing up.
[01:36:00.035 --> 01:36:02.476]  Just like Lord Monckton said, a freedom party globally.
[01:36:02.776 --> 01:36:09.379]  But it's not a global government, it's individual sovereign groups in nations standing together against the organized global tyranny.
[01:36:09.979 --> 01:36:15.321]  And that's the vacuum that we are changing and other organizations, Tea Parties, worldwide are forming.
[01:36:16.101 --> 01:36:19.622]  That's why this article from Infowars.net is so important.
[01:36:19.662 --> 01:36:23.882]  Tea Party co-founder, concept has been hijacked by false left-right paradigm.
[01:36:24.262 --> 01:36:39.325]  Chad Peace, who I want to get on, he was the founder of the main Tea Party movements out of a bunch of different organizations and out of Ron Paul groups and others and it's been totally hijacked and he went on Fox News and talked about it.
[01:36:39.925 --> 01:36:43.326]  And it's been hijacked by Sarah Palin, the Republican Party and Glenn Beck.
[01:36:43.846 --> 01:36:45.847]  Now again, I don't just sit here and attack people.
[01:36:45.968 --> 01:36:47.268]  I know Glenn Beck's an operative.
[01:36:47.689 --> 01:36:52.292]  I know they're meant to control a real revolution and to stop us from ever getting things back.
[01:36:52.352 --> 01:36:54.493]  So, we just re-infiltrate their groups.
[01:36:54.894 --> 01:36:56.595]  Go in and say, hey, you want the real truth?
[01:36:56.935 --> 01:36:58.056]  Here's fall of the republic.
[01:36:58.416 --> 01:36:59.257]  You want the real truth?
[01:36:59.437 --> 01:37:01.618]  Here's We Are Change Chicago confronting Al Gore.
[01:37:02.019 --> 01:37:02.919]  You want the real truth?
[01:37:02.959 --> 01:37:05.941]  Go out and protest Al Gore this weekend with Luke Hradowski.
[01:37:06.742 --> 01:37:07.502]  This is what we're doing.
[01:37:07.863 --> 01:37:08.943]  I salute you, gentlemen.
[01:37:09.084 --> 01:37:09.484]  Take care.
[01:37:11.576 --> 01:37:24.638]  Okay, let's now go to Anthony of We Are Change Ohio, in closing, who have just been doing a sterling job as well, not just with Gore, but the illegal military checkpoints, all the bizarre martial law stuff going on.
[01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:26.259]  They've been doing so much.
[01:37:27.339 --> 01:37:32.220]  Al Gore canceling his Copenhagen trip and speeches, now hiding wherever he's going to speak.
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.420]  They are certainly afraid, aren't they?
[01:37:35.541 --> 01:37:37.081]  I think they're definitely afraid.
[01:37:38.174 --> 01:37:45.561]  He's been doing these book signings for a while, and every time he goes out and does these speeches or these book signings, people are confronting him everywhere.
[01:37:45.981 --> 01:37:48.083]  And I mean, this guy is just on the run.
[01:37:48.183 --> 01:37:59.274]  It's amazing to just see all these amazing patriots from chapters all over the country confronting this guy, and getting out real issues, and taking over media, and confronting these guys.
[01:38:01.363 --> 01:38:02.324]  Beautifully said.
[01:38:02.884 --> 01:38:06.587]  Tell us about some of the things We Are Change Ohio has been doing.
[01:38:06.607 --> 01:38:11.871]  I know a lot of groups don't have any video because the police have also confiscated their Al Gore confrontation video.
[01:38:13.132 --> 01:38:25.863]  Yes, back in April 1st of this year, all of our great members, Sam, Rachel, Josh, Brad, we went and confronted this guy and what happened was
[01:38:26.584 --> 01:38:30.665]  Sam was in there filming, and after we confronted him, we have all the audio.
[01:38:30.725 --> 01:38:33.726]  Sam actually has to go back to court this weekend.
[01:38:33.786 --> 01:38:36.327]  This has been now about eight to seven months.
[01:38:36.667 --> 01:38:40.848]  He has to go back and try and get his footage, so he's in the midst of this court battle.
[01:38:40.888 --> 01:38:47.610]  That's Sam Logolo of We Air Change Ohio, and he also has a court issue going on because he got arrested at the G20.
[01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:53.491]  But we confronted Al Gore, and his goons basically grabbed Sam because he was filming.
[01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:56.032]  They did not want this confrontation on film.
[01:38:56.721 --> 01:38:58.622]  And they tried to make him delete his footage.
[01:38:58.723 --> 01:38:59.303]  He wouldn't.
[01:38:59.743 --> 01:39:03.106]  And because he wouldn't, they arrested him and he was in jail overnight.
[01:39:04.026 --> 01:39:08.349]  This was back in... But they didn't stop him because now everybody's confronting him.
[01:39:08.770 --> 01:39:10.771]  But Gore understood the power of this.
[01:39:10.791 --> 01:39:12.693]  That's why they tried to suppress free speech.
[01:39:13.113 --> 01:39:14.254]  But it's not working.
[01:39:14.814 --> 01:39:16.896]  Give us the WeAreChangeOhio site, sir.
[01:39:17.856 --> 01:39:23.741]  Yes, we just launched our new WeAreChangeOhio.org site actually last night.
[01:39:23.781 --> 01:39:25.122]  So it's WeAreChangeOhio.org.
[01:39:26.312 --> 01:39:28.373]  We have an email that you can contact us at.
[01:39:28.413 --> 01:39:31.294]  That's wearchangeohio at live dot com.
[01:39:31.334 --> 01:39:32.854]  And we're doing a lot of amazing stuff.
[01:39:33.135 --> 01:39:37.176]  We're doing showings of your movies, the Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic.
[01:39:37.216 --> 01:39:38.837]  We've confronted so many different people.
[01:39:38.877 --> 01:39:46.119]  Fareed Zakaria, Obama, Joe Biden, John McCain, the Clintons, Richard and Haas, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, and so many more.
[01:39:46.619 --> 01:39:49.300]  And the great thing about Ohio is it's a battleground state.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.381]  So during the primaries when these
[01:39:51.952 --> 01:39:54.614]  Criminals come here and try and spew out their propaganda.
[01:39:54.754 --> 01:39:59.458]  We take over the media with real issues, and we have Fox and CNN.
[01:39:59.779 --> 01:40:13.250]  Over the summer, about two years ago, when I confronted John McCain about his connection with PNAC, he freaked out, but CNN covered it, and millions and millions of people saw that, and they realized that
[01:40:13.703 --> 01:40:18.448]  You know, they realized his connection with 9-11 and I had people coming up and patting me on the back.
[01:40:18.888 --> 01:40:19.809]  And this is the key.
[01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:24.154]  We're now teaching everybody else how to go out and confront.
[01:40:24.494 --> 01:40:29.560]  We're now showing everyone else how vulnerable these enemies are to the truth.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.983]  You shine a light on them, it's like a vampire being thrown out in sunlight.
[01:40:33.023 --> 01:40:34.505]  They turn to ash and blow away.
[01:40:34.845 --> 01:40:35.766]  Great job, Anthony.
[01:40:35.786 --> 01:40:36.407]  We salute you.
[01:40:37.148 --> 01:40:38.108]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:40:38.148 --> 01:40:38.949]  Thanks for having me on, buddy.
[01:40:53.055 --> 01:41:02.360]  The Netherlands, Tokyo, and remember what I did a few months ago where I asked listeners to post signs with Obama as the Joker, when the media said it should be illegal.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:03.820]  We said, well, we'll just tell everybody to go do it.
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:12.724]  And it was hundreds of TV reports, hundreds of newspaper articles, and then finally the media backed off and stopped saying, oh, arrest everybody, because people rebelled against that tyranny.
[01:41:13.985 --> 01:41:16.086]  You have to exercise your will over these people.
[01:41:16.266 --> 01:41:17.046]  That's what they've done to us.
[01:41:17.086 --> 01:41:18.467]  They've trained us how to be slaves.
[01:41:18.887 --> 01:41:21.048]  We have to teach them that we're not their property.
[01:41:22.039 --> 01:41:23.179]  And that's what's starting to happen.
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:32.522]  So, make your own We Are Change group, or make an InfoWars group, or make a Tea Party group, or whatever.
[01:41:32.602 --> 01:41:33.862]  Call it whatever you want.
[01:41:34.562 --> 01:41:35.703]  Start two, three groups.
[01:41:35.743 --> 01:41:37.003]  Just get involved.
[01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:41.384]  It's so simple.
[01:41:41.444 --> 01:41:42.504]  We can beat these people.
[01:41:42.524 --> 01:41:43.505]  They're in full retreat.
[01:41:43.785 --> 01:41:48.146]  I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up on some economic news and try to jam in some final phone calls, but Ted,
[01:41:50.151 --> 01:41:51.811]  I mean, this revolution's in full swing.
[01:41:52.792 --> 01:41:54.872]  Professors are stepping down.
[01:41:54.912 --> 01:41:56.793]  Members of Parliament are stepping down over this.
[01:41:57.213 --> 01:41:59.353]  The Australian government is collapsing over it.
[01:41:59.393 --> 01:42:02.354]  Their whole cap-and-trade tax system just imploded and failed.
[01:42:02.834 --> 01:42:04.435]  That's the Financial Times of London.
[01:42:05.395 --> 01:42:08.616]  Al Gore's cancelling speaking engagements and trips in Copenhagen.
[01:42:10.606 --> 01:42:14.647]  In congressional testimony, the White House science czar is being grilled over this.
[01:42:14.667 --> 01:42:17.768]  I mean, this is really blowing up in their face.
[01:42:18.488 --> 01:42:26.370]  And it is literally our great activist listeners that are at the vanguard, absolute tip of the spear, ramming it into the heart of this dragon.
[01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:30.091]  Alex, there are no better listeners than our listeners.
[01:42:30.371 --> 01:42:36.492]  These are the people that are actually changing the face of the United States of America and the entire world.
[01:42:37.252 --> 01:42:39.313]  And I can tell you, I salute them all.
[01:42:40.797 --> 01:42:46.181]  I'm in-depthly grateful and I'm just so proud.
[01:42:46.201 --> 01:43:00.111]  I just can't even say enough to how wonderful the listeners of your show, the Genesis Communications Network, this entire movement, I mean it is just mind-boggling.
[01:43:00.511 --> 01:43:07.897]  Mind-boggling to be sitting at the center of something this big is just unbelievable.
[01:43:09.445 --> 01:43:19.312]  Well, Ted, I mean, just as a sonar ping of our success, I went to a Megadeth concert because I was invited to go interview Dave Mustaine behind the scenes and do an interview about the New World Order with him.
[01:43:20.353 --> 01:43:21.694]  And he said, no, hang around.
[01:43:21.914 --> 01:43:22.395]  You'll stay.
[01:43:23.524 --> 01:43:24.525]  Because I got up at 5 a.m.
[01:43:24.565 --> 01:43:27.787]  that day and drove up there, but I was pretty tired, but I stayed for the concert.
[01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:33.212]  And walking around out there in the crowd, literally every three people I walked past were, hey, Alex Jones!
[01:43:33.632 --> 01:43:36.174]  They were old, they were young, they were black, they were white.
[01:43:36.915 --> 01:43:40.298]  They were wearing InfoWars t-shirts, which is again, it's just an indicator.
[01:43:40.318 --> 01:43:42.500]  And most of them were homemade and stuff.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.121]  We certainly don't sell that many.
[01:43:44.962 --> 01:43:46.383]  I mean, this is...
[01:43:47.614 --> 01:43:50.736]  Again, just an indicator of just the work we've done.
[01:43:50.796 --> 01:43:53.218]  And there's so many other people out there taking action.
[01:43:53.678 --> 01:44:01.204]  I mean, Ted, the New World Order knows that actually a large percentage, maybe even a majority of Americans are finally waking up or have woken up.
[01:44:01.704 --> 01:44:03.325]  And the battle is now joined, Ted.
[01:44:04.286 --> 01:44:04.966]  It sure has.
[01:44:05.287 --> 01:44:06.427]  It sure has.
[01:44:06.467 --> 01:44:11.771]  And it's been an interesting feat coming right along with all this whole thing.
[01:44:12.131 --> 01:44:15.674]  But I do believe, Alex, we're going to kick their rear ends right out of there.
[01:44:16.243 --> 01:44:20.005]  The United States of America will return back to its original form.
[01:44:20.465 --> 01:44:23.806]  It's just like that Renegade song that you had coming in.
[01:44:24.366 --> 01:44:29.349]  And thank God for the Renegade and for their descendants.
[01:44:29.809 --> 01:44:30.529]  And that's us.
[01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:32.910]  And now we've got to think about our descendants.
[01:44:32.970 --> 01:44:36.331]  And we've got to be the people standing up and fighting for this nation.
[01:44:36.351 --> 01:44:39.273]  Because if we don't fight by God, they'll take it from us.
[01:44:42.014 --> 01:44:44.235]  Well, Ted, I got you up here briefly because
[01:44:45.569 --> 01:44:48.494]  You said two weeks ago you thought it would go above $1,200 by Christmas.
[01:44:48.514 --> 01:44:49.235]  It's already gone to $1,226 today.
[01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:57.110]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:44:57.150 --> 01:45:07.797]  I wanted to briefly have you up to tell the listeners, you buy the gold when it's lower, you sell it at the low price even when it goes up, but I know that you've basically run out of all the stuff at the $1,050 level.
[01:45:08.177 --> 01:45:09.278]  What do you have now?
[01:45:09.558 --> 01:45:12.400]  I mean, that was a deal that's never been topped before.
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:16.222]  I haven't asked you, what's the gold and silver offering you have today?
[01:45:16.522 --> 01:45:20.485]  Well, sadly as it is, foreigners are trying to get away from the U.S.
[01:45:20.545 --> 01:45:23.167]  dollar and that's driving it down and that's driving gold up.
[01:45:24.362 --> 01:45:28.005]  Right now, I am still carrying British Sovereigns at $325.
[01:45:28.425 --> 01:45:30.607]  Pricing-wise, you're asking me where that comes in.
[01:45:30.627 --> 01:45:33.649]  I picked up those at about $1,125 an ounce.
[01:45:34.469 --> 01:45:36.691]  The Franks are currently at $263.
[01:45:38.112 --> 01:45:48.199]  Lakota Silvers right now are at $2451, but I haven't had to move up the Montana Silver rounds because I picked up 5,000 of them before gold jumped over $19 an ounce for silver.
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:51.181]  We're good to go.
[01:46:13.144 --> 01:46:13.785]  I think so.
[01:46:29.748 --> 01:46:34.110]  Just a whole long line of different things that I try to buy when the market's down.
[01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:41.412]  I had just about two hours of opportunity to buy while gold and silver was down today, and it comes jumping back up again.
[01:46:41.752 --> 01:46:46.394]  When we went to bed last night while we were sleeping, gold ran over $1,220 an ounce, and like you said, hit $1,226.
[01:46:52.156 --> 01:47:00.059]  I mean, obviously, here in New York, they try to push it back down again, but in the world market, they're ignoring that fact.
[01:47:00.419 --> 01:47:01.859]  I mean, China's buying gold.
[01:47:02.019 --> 01:47:02.479]  India.
[01:47:02.879 --> 01:47:03.780]  I mean, you name it.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:04.520]  I mean, it's out there.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:10.202]  They're buying it, and quite frankly, the people of the United States of America should be, too.
[01:47:10.962 --> 01:47:17.233]  I mean, we used to be able to produce our currency by mining it out of the ground and there was no debt associated to it.
[01:47:17.613 --> 01:47:25.266]  I don't know how in the world we allowed our government to join forces and collude with a private
[01:47:25.931 --> 01:47:31.794]  Banking system that doesn't even account, you know, it's not accountable to our own politicians that we elect.
[01:47:32.294 --> 01:47:34.495]  You know, they're driving the currency down.
[01:47:34.535 --> 01:47:39.258]  It's worth less than 10 cents from where it once was when it was first introduced.
[01:47:39.798 --> 01:47:45.181]  You know, it just makes absolutely no sense to stay in a fiat paper currency.
[01:47:45.681 --> 01:47:53.125]  And yes, indeed, I am buying when there's dips, and I'll try to get you the best price I can on gold, but by now you should have woken up
[01:47:54.206 --> 01:48:02.012]  And taking a serious look at your portfolio, and in addition to this, if you do buy from Midas Resources, you're helping this cause.
[01:48:02.052 --> 01:48:09.057]  I don't know how important you think it is, but, you know, I mean, I know Alex, you and I, and myself too, are committed 150, 200%.
[01:48:10.238 --> 01:48:12.560]  We're not stopping.
[01:48:13.161 --> 01:48:16.323]  And we're not going to quit, not even when the chips get tough.
[01:48:16.663 --> 01:48:18.445]  We're going to be moving on forward with this.
[01:48:19.142 --> 01:48:20.143]  Absolutely, Ted.
[01:48:20.643 --> 01:48:21.543]  The brokers are there.
[01:48:21.563 --> 01:48:25.866]  So explain to people, your gold, at what point in the market did you buy this gold?
[01:48:26.586 --> 01:48:28.908]  What was the market when you bought this gold for that savings?
[01:48:29.008 --> 01:48:30.969]  This stuff was bought at about $1,125 an ounce.
[01:48:30.989 --> 01:48:32.510]  And right now we're looking at gold over $1,226.
[01:48:38.479 --> 01:48:40.701]  I mean, I don't know how I can make this easier for you.
[01:48:40.842 --> 01:48:47.268]  I really want to say you need to get out of paper currency, and you need to look at gold.
[01:48:47.429 --> 01:48:52.053]  So this is, you bought roughly when the market was $100 lower than it is now, and you're passing on those savings?
[01:48:52.994 --> 01:48:53.855]  Yes, that's right.
[01:48:54.196 --> 01:48:57.679]  And you're saying it roughly, and that's the way to say it, because it's fluctuating between $1,185
[01:49:00.129 --> 01:49:05.015]  I'm sorry, $1,200 and about $1,215 and $1,225.
[01:49:05.375 --> 01:49:09.019]  And so yes, indeed, this is a great buy.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:10.801]  Good time to be getting it.
[01:49:10.821 --> 01:49:15.346]  I mean, just to explain it, the gold you're selling now, what was the market then when you bought it?
[01:49:15.366 --> 01:49:16.187]  $1,125 an ounce.
[01:49:19.713 --> 01:49:20.574]  Don't confuse it.
[01:49:20.814 --> 01:49:25.918]  Every single coin carries a premium over what's trading in New York City in the spot market.
[01:49:26.339 --> 01:49:30.642]  That means that I'm buying coins when it was priced when the spot prices at that time.
[01:49:31.103 --> 01:49:36.207]  But now, I'm still holding the price even though gold has run up over $1,200 an ounce.
[01:49:36.727 --> 01:49:38.048]  I haven't changed my prices.
[01:49:38.088 --> 01:49:41.872]  Just go rewind and go back a few days and listen to the archives.
[01:49:42.232 --> 01:49:46.716]  Gold has gone up a tremendous amount and I'm still selling the coins for the same price.
[01:49:47.136 --> 01:49:47.916]  You can do the math.
[01:49:47.956 --> 01:49:49.297]  I've been doing this for a while, Alex.
[01:49:49.557 --> 01:49:56.798]  I don't know how many more opportunities I'm going to get to do this because gold is not coming back down and giving me that opportunity to buy it low again.
[01:49:57.239 --> 01:50:01.360]  Yeah, so you've already sold out of the gold that you bought at the $1,050 level with it now $1,226 today.
[01:50:06.701 --> 01:50:08.822]  That was the best deal ever that you were offering last week.
[01:50:08.862 --> 01:50:09.542]  That sold out.
[01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:18.085]  You still have an incredible deal of gold you bought at the $1,120 range, with gold now $100 above that.
[01:50:18.885 --> 01:50:20.666]  Believe me, I shop around for gold and silver.
[01:50:20.706 --> 01:50:22.367]  Buy a coin here, some coins there.
[01:50:22.847 --> 01:50:26.048]  Believe me, I buy from Ted because I'm getting the deal you're getting.
[01:50:26.588 --> 01:50:28.550]  Right now, you cannot find deals better.
[01:50:28.570 --> 01:50:29.751]  If you can, please tell me.
[01:50:29.771 --> 01:50:30.572]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:32.474 --> 01:50:37.038]  The folks at Midas Resources will be there until midnight again tonight, Central Time.
[01:50:37.058 --> 01:50:37.098]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:37.118 --> 01:50:38.680]  Do not procrastinate.
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:40.001]  Don't be foolish.
[01:50:42.884 --> 01:50:46.026]  This is one hell of a bull market and it's only going up because they're killing the dollar.
[01:50:46.046 --> 01:50:46.086]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:46.486]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:46.506 --> 01:50:48.007]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:50:48.067 --> 01:50:48.948]  Call now.
[01:50:49.008 --> 01:50:52.730]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Special to get those low prices.
[01:51:00.819 --> 01:51:05.381]  We all have to fight germs, but can your antibiotic beat the germ-fighting power of oil of oregano?
[01:51:05.641 --> 01:51:14.266]  The International Journal of Food Microbiology says that oil of oregano is one of nature's most powerful germicides, effectively killing a wide range of bacteria and fungi.
[01:51:14.586 --> 01:51:17.547]  Oil of oregano can be used daily for those prone to getting sick.
[01:51:17.707 --> 01:51:23.630]  The active biochemical in oregano oil is the phenylcarbacrol, which circulates in the blood with antimicrobial action.
[01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:27.292]  Oil of oregano is known to be a potent antiviral, antibacterial,
[01:51:27.312 --> 01:51:27.552]  Yes, it is.
[01:51:27.572 --> 01:51:30.054]  It's natural, antibacterial, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic oil.
[01:51:30.314 --> 01:51:34.356]  And don't be surprised to learn that oil of oregano is a powerful painkiller, too.
[01:51:34.797 --> 01:51:37.818]  Buy your oil of oregano from HealthTruthRevealed.com.
[01:51:38.038 --> 01:51:41.861]  Our oil of oregano is 100% guaranteed true wild oregano.

[01:51:57.995 --> 01:51:58.535]  Are you healthy?
[01:52:00.777 --> 01:52:04.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:07.803]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:08.043 --> 01:52:09.444]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:10.243 --> 01:52:12.824]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:12.844 --> 01:52:19.046]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:19.206 --> 01:52:24.248]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:24.408 --> 01:52:34.391]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:34.511 --> 01:52:36.613]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:36.853 --> 01:52:38.194]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:38.455 --> 01:52:40.737]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:40.917 --> 01:52:42.759]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:42.779 --> 01:52:47.863]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:54:14.354 --> 01:54:17.337]  And I'm not going to have time to play the whole clip.
[01:54:19.616 --> 01:54:27.678]  But I'm going to play Senator Sensenbrenner, bringing this up to him, and watch the rest of the clip up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:27.718 --> 01:54:33.940]  We're just going to end the show with this, then the rebroadcast will begin with all the news and information and calls and guests we had on.
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:35.420]  We're just out of time for everything else.
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.881]  Al Gore has canceled his Copenhagen trip.
[01:54:40.677 --> 01:54:46.943]  And leaving the Minion ticket holders in the lurch because he doesn't want to be associated with Climategate.
[01:54:47.423 --> 01:54:49.144]  I mean, this is a big deal, folks.
[01:54:49.184 --> 01:54:51.166]  I don't ever get up on air and start popping champagne.
[01:54:51.687 --> 01:54:53.028]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:54:53.328 --> 01:54:54.589]  Because we know it's fraud.
[01:54:54.669 --> 01:54:56.070]  We know they've been involved in fraud.
[01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:57.752]  They're caught covering up the fraud.
[01:54:57.792 --> 01:55:01.134]  This is the head UN climate center that cooks the books.
[01:55:01.675 --> 01:55:03.156]  This is a godsend.
[01:55:03.236 --> 01:55:07.379]  And we need to remember this and keep beating the drum, making the story bigger.
[01:55:08.303 --> 01:55:14.585]  All the articles Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo and Steve Watson and others write and post at Infowars.com.
[01:55:14.905 --> 01:55:15.525]  Get them all.
[01:55:15.585 --> 01:55:16.545]  Get them out to everybody.
[01:55:16.585 --> 01:55:17.225]  Continue.
[01:55:17.545 --> 01:55:18.626]  Go to your city council.
[01:55:18.666 --> 01:55:19.686]  Go to your public schools.
[01:55:19.726 --> 01:55:20.546]  Go to your school board.
[01:55:20.846 --> 01:55:22.167]  They're brainwashing your kids.
[01:55:22.487 --> 01:55:28.468]  Three days ago we broke and put out the UN internal documents, how they've got local brainwashing in every western country.
[01:55:28.788 --> 01:55:29.669]  They are taking over.
[01:55:29.749 --> 01:55:30.689]  This is diabolical.
[01:55:31.579 --> 01:55:32.620]  I don't want to get to whether or not
[01:55:53.325 --> 01:55:55.947]  They were legally placed in the public record.
[01:55:55.987 --> 01:55:58.248]  The question is whether or not they were accurate.
[01:55:58.789 --> 01:56:01.891]  Because if they were accurate, it's profoundly disturbing.
[01:56:02.031 --> 01:56:02.852]  Stop right there!
[01:56:04.373 --> 01:56:06.414]  What type of research is Sensenbrenner doing?
[01:56:06.794 --> 01:56:11.197]  Day one, Phil Jones admitted that was their emails and they were taken and that's what they said.
[01:56:11.838 --> 01:56:14.019]  We've got the computer program written for fraud.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:17.862]  So even the Republicans and Democrats up there are acting like they're not sure.
[01:56:18.222 --> 01:56:19.043]  That's the spin.
[01:56:19.083 --> 01:56:20.364]  I told you that would be the spin.
[01:56:20.404 --> 01:56:21.044]  That is the spin.
[01:56:21.284 --> 01:56:21.825]  Go back to them.
[01:56:23.746 --> 01:56:24.487]  Climate change.
[01:56:25.067 --> 01:56:35.857]  Now, the data from the Climate Research Unit at the UEA in England is one of only three major data sets, but they considerably overlap.
[01:56:36.677 --> 01:56:42.242]  And they've been used as a basis for the IPCC report, as well as the U.S.
[01:56:42.262 --> 01:56:44.084]  Global Change Research Program.
[01:56:44.642 --> 01:56:55.245]  And that means that these two booklets that were passed out this morning, you know, at best need to have a thorough review in the light of this information that has been disclosed.
[01:56:55.785 --> 01:57:02.087]  And at worst, it's junk science and it is a part of a massive international scientific fraud.
[01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:12.336]  Now, Dr. Holden, you've been in the middle of a lot of this, and I've got a couple of questions based upon your statements before you joined the Obama administration.
[01:57:14.157 --> 01:57:27.425]  You gave an interview in August of 2006 with BBC News in the UK, and you said that a sea level rise of up to 13 feet was in the realm of possibility.
[01:57:28.325 --> 01:57:38.415]  However, that's 11 feet higher than what the IPPC has estimated over this period of time, which is somewhere between 7 and 23 inches.
[01:57:39.296 --> 01:57:43.881]  Now, with respect to the hockey stick theory, which the chairman has referred to,
[01:57:45.468 --> 01:57:50.395]  That's been pretty much discredited in the scientific community.
[01:57:50.455 --> 01:57:52.858]  Let's just leave it there.
[01:57:52.998 --> 01:57:58.466]  I'm going to start the show tomorrow with that, and I'm going to analyze it piece by piece.
[01:58:01.348 --> 01:58:07.631]  Holdren, in this book, written in 1976, says that we would be in an ice age by the year 2000.
[01:58:08.331 --> 01:58:09.351]  It was global cooling.
[01:58:09.391 --> 01:58:10.572]  We had to have a tax to stop it.
[01:58:11.012 --> 01:58:12.272]  I mean, these are just frauds.
[01:58:12.312 --> 01:58:13.593]  These are just scaremongers.
[01:58:13.893 --> 01:58:15.054]  They know they're scaring.
[01:58:15.274 --> 01:58:19.195]  They admit that they're just lying to people to get their global government.
[01:58:19.515 --> 01:58:20.696]  Global government's real.
[01:58:20.756 --> 01:58:21.776]  World government's real.
[01:58:21.836 --> 01:58:22.457]  We were right.
[01:58:22.537 --> 01:58:23.437]  We read the documents.
[01:58:23.497 --> 01:58:24.137]  We warned you.
[01:58:24.417 --> 01:58:28.139]  The establishment told you none of it existed, so you'd stand down and buy the hoax.
[01:58:28.539 --> 01:58:31.802]  Stand up, get angry, say no to these murdering criminals!
[01:58:32.443 --> 01:58:35.505]  These people want to murder you and your family, period!

[01:58:49.099 --> 01:58:54.266]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:54.406 --> 01:58:56.329]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:58:56.489 --> 01:58:58.772]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:58:58.932 --> 01:59:00.795]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:01.215 --> 01:59:02.557]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:02.837 --> 01:59:03.859]  There is a solution.
[01:59:04.099 --> 01:59:12.128]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
