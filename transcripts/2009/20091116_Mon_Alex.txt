[00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.120]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.542]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:12.624]  Well, I've seen him on CNBC, CNN, you name it.
[00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:18.367]  He's Damon Vickers, Chief Investment Officer with Nine Points Management and Research.
[00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:21.688]  Their fund is up over 63% this year.
[00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.330]  You don't see that with a lot of funds out there, do you?
[00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.811]  He has a long, illustrious career.
[00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:40.227]  And he has a 25-year track record of articulating investment themes with striking clarity and then holding his ground as the daily barrage of market noise forces others to falter.
[00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:42.989]  And I watch mainstream financial shows.
[00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.091]  Very few of them are accurate, because most of them have an establishment spin.
[00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:50.913]  But this guy has been very, very accurate in the past.
[00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:51.853]  That's why we've got him on.
[00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:56.576]  And I was flattered to find out when we called him on the show that he is actually a listener sometimes.
[00:00:56.896 --> 00:00:59.097]  So, Mr. Vickers, it's great to have you on with us.
[00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:00.603]  No, it's great to be with you.
[00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:01.483]  Not sometimes.
[00:01:01.523 --> 00:01:09.889]  I listen to your show, Alex, every night, and I do appreciate the praise of saying that we're up 63% this year.
[00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:19.656]  We're actually having a really good year this year, I believe, and we're long golden oil, but we were actually up 63% last year in 2008.
[00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:24.239]  Maybe that's even better, but we had a really great year in 2008.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.622]  So, if I got that wrong, how are you doing this year, then?
[00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:30.136]  We're doing okay.
[00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.497]  I mean, we've had some ups and downs.
[00:01:31.537 --> 00:01:31.977]  We're long.
[00:01:31.997 --> 00:01:33.418]  We're doing really good today.
[00:01:33.438 --> 00:01:43.202]  I don't know if anybody's noticed, but oil is up close to $3 a barrel, which is a reflection of the dollar situation, which I know we'll be talking about, and gold.
[00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:46.023]  Gold is making new highs, and we're long gold.
[00:01:46.323 --> 00:01:53.386]  So, we're really happy with what we're seeing this year, and I think we'll continue to do good for the balance of the year.
[00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:55.047]  We like our positions very much.
[00:01:56.385 --> 00:02:03.309]  I want to go through a whole host of issues with you today, sir, in the 50 minutes we have, and you're gracious to give us that much time in your busy schedule.
[00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.851]  But first, tell the listeners who may not know who you are a little bit about yourself.
[00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:07.872]  You have a long bio.
[00:02:08.152 --> 00:02:09.072]  What's most important?
[00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:22.880]  Then let's recap and expand what you talked about last week on CNBC about global government, world government, end of the dollar, gold only going up, and what you see happening in the near-term, mid-term, and long-term.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.421]  Break it down for us.
[00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.290]  Yeah, we'll have a chance to do all that.
[00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.573]  I've been running money for about 25 years.
[00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:36.358]  My father was a floor trader for Goldman Sachs on the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:02:36.998 --> 00:02:48.247]  My grandfather worked for Peter Peabody and best friends with Bill Donaldson, who ran the SEC and is currently on, I believe, Barack Obama's think tank at this point.
[00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:54.072]  My great-grandmother, Catherine Angel, founded the Culinary Institute of America.
[00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:57.317]  Also known as the CIA, ironically enough.
[00:02:58.618 --> 00:03:02.940]  And her husband was president of Yale University for a number of decades.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.883]  And I saw a lot of people when I was a kid.
[00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:09.863]  I saw a lot of people come in and out of the house.
[00:03:11.584 --> 00:03:12.425]  The Rockefellers.
[00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:14.566]  Who else?
[00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:15.186]  Kissinger.
[00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:18.288]  Just everybody.
[00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:19.928]  My great-grandmother was a kind of a...
[00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:22.482]  Well, that's amazing.
[00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:24.724]  I'm flattered to have you as a listener.
[00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:59.478]  But I would see Christmas cards and the like from the Rockefellers, and our families had houses next to each other in Seal Harbor, Maine, up on Mount Desert Island.
[00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:07.424]  And the story goes that John Dee's son proposed to my great-grandmother, but she turned him down.
[00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:13.128]  And married the famous psychiatrist who went on to become the president of Yale.
[00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:15.770]  Loved my great-grandmother a whole bunch.
[00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.691]  Great, great woman.
[00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:26.559]  Over the last 25 years, I've been very involved in growth investing, predominantly, and we were early investors in Starbucks, coffee, and Amazon.com.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.822]  I've called two market tops in the last decade, notably the one in 2000.
[00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:35.165]  Okay, well I want to get into... Sure, fire out the websites for us.
[00:04:58.292 --> 00:04:59.214]  We have a couple of websites.
[00:04:59.274 --> 00:05:10.833]  I guess damonvickers.com would be stuff about me, and then the other site for our fund management would be www.npmnancypaulmary.us.
[00:05:13.502 --> 00:05:18.123]  Well, let me ask you this question, because I don't normally want to sit here and talk about myself here, but you're a big analyst.
[00:05:18.664 --> 00:05:20.164]  Why are you listening to this show?
[00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:21.124]  You're a busy guy.
[00:05:21.144 --> 00:05:27.306]  I mean, are you listening to try to see what the grassroots, what the trends are, or is it just an interesting show?
[00:05:27.586 --> 00:05:37.009]  And why are you coming out on TV, and increasingly others are as well, and talking about reality, the world government, the global currency, the end of the dollar?
[00:05:37.648 --> 00:05:37.808]  Yeah.
[00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:45.334]  Well, I mean, number one, one of the things, I mean, I did radio myself for about five years, and your approach, I think that's Peter Reeve.
[00:05:45.434 --> 00:05:46.234]  I know Peter Reeve.
[00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:49.056]  And I like your show.
[00:05:49.177 --> 00:05:52.739]  I like your, you've got a great feel to it, a great energy, great pacing.
[00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:58.864]  I can't say I agree with everything you say on the radio show, but you put on a really good radio show.
[00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:05.889]  You know, people, I think, like yourself, Alex, they're looking down a tunnel.
[00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:10.672]  You know, some people may see, you know, a light approaching, coming down that tunnel.
[00:06:11.052 --> 00:06:17.257]  And yet there may be some people that say, no, that isn't light, that's actually a 100 ton locomotive heading your way!
[00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:19.258]  You need to do something!
[00:06:19.798 --> 00:06:23.681]  Now, the person that says that will usually be called crazy.
[00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:26.543]  Oh, you must be, you know, you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:06:26.563 --> 00:06:33.508]  You know, no one necessarily listens to you at the moment when you're making calls like that.
[00:06:34.308 --> 00:06:37.931]  But the evidence cannot be ignored.
[00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:39.272]  There is kind of a momentum.
[00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:47.538]  There is a trend in terms of global developments, and there is a trend in terms of where things are moving towards.
[00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:51.279]  Some of those things, you know, my father talked about.
[00:06:51.299 --> 00:07:02.963]  You know, my father worked for the Institute of World Affairs for a brief time, and he would take people back and forth, like Henry Kissinger, like others, and they talked about this.
[00:07:02.983 --> 00:07:13.127]  This was well over 20 years ago, maybe 25 years ago, they would talk about dividing the world, basically, into three geographic trading zones.
[00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:16.331]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:07:29.906 --> 00:07:44.477]  Well that's the Trilateral Commission model stated by them and then I would read their own documents on air and people would say that's never going to happen and reading over their strategic plan and now it's come out with Goldman Sachs betting against the housing market secretly while they were
[00:07:46.226 --> 00:07:47.848]  You know, telling the public to invest in it.
[00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:50.412]  Clearly, this is command destruction.
[00:07:50.472 --> 00:08:01.106]  A lot of these groups at the apex of the pyramid, they're getting a lot of power, a lot of control out of these crises, which they understand in advance.
[00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:02.476]  Right.
[00:08:02.636 --> 00:08:06.457]  Well, you know, there are problems beyond that.
[00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:08.877]  I mean, yes, before, I agree with you.
[00:08:08.897 --> 00:08:12.618]  Yes, before, why have I gone on the air and said that?
[00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:17.759]  You know, when I go on the air, I really don't try to prep everything that I'm going to say.
[00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:23.480]  I mean, I think the more you prep your comments, the more dead the interview becomes.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.861]  And I've looked forward to our interview together, and I thought, well, how much prepping am I going to do?
[00:08:27.881 --> 00:08:30.802]  You can do a little prep, but the more I prep, the more candid it sounds.
[00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:43.315]  When I made those comments, and you may want to replay them, but I basically said that I thought that the world was moving, in all likelihood, towards some type of a currency crisis.
[00:08:43.715 --> 00:08:47.021]  And I do believe that it feels like we're moving towards that.
[00:08:47.942 --> 00:08:54.169]  In that currency crisis, you're going to have people that are going to be pretty panicked.
[00:08:54.369 --> 00:08:56.031]  There's going to be kind of a panic.
[00:08:56.351 --> 00:08:58.674]  Not just a global, but not just a United States panic.
[00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:08.044]  Because if the dollar really comes under pressure, and I don't mean just going down in dribs and drabs, I mean you come in on a Monday morning and the dollar is down 10-15% overnight.
[00:09:10.847 --> 00:09:12.788]  It's not just going to be the dollar that's affected.
[00:09:12.828 --> 00:09:18.809]  It will likely be other currencies that are also affected simultaneously, in a kind of a domino effect.
[00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:23.310]  And that could be kind of destabilizing on a global basis.
[00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.930]  It will cause kind of a panic.
[00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:32.572]  What would the world or what would global powers do in response to that?
[00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:38.133]  Well, if you had a total lack of confidence and all that, the first thing that they would do is they would raise interest rates.
[00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:44.510]  So you see this ratcheting up immediately of interest rates to try to defend their currencies.
[00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:47.134]  That, in all likelihood, won't work.
[00:09:48.464 --> 00:09:52.146]  And then, what you have is the dollar still goes down.
[00:09:52.206 --> 00:09:55.267]  It doesn't matter how high they raise their interest rates.
[00:09:55.347 --> 00:09:56.747]  People just don't want them.
[00:09:56.787 --> 00:09:58.008]  They just don't want dollars.
[00:09:58.428 --> 00:10:00.089]  They also just don't want pounds.
[00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:06.331]  They just don't want all of those, because there's utterly nothing backing any of the global currencies.
[00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.653]  They are literally wampum, just a piece of paper.
[00:10:10.293 --> 00:10:13.074]  Not even paper currencies are made out of linen, but there's just nothing behind them.
[00:10:13.434 --> 00:10:21.101]  But if there's a currency based on taxing energy like the cap and trade or carbon tax, is that going to be one of the new units?
[00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:24.745]  And then of course commodities themselves, oil, gold, pork bellies?
[00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:27.638]  We're good to go.
[00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:44.129]  That's right.
[00:11:00.295 --> 00:11:03.416]  Of, I would guess, maybe the G20 at this point, or something like that.
[00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:14.220]  And the proposal would be put out there, to that we've come together in this crisis, and out of this crisis, we've decided to form a new alignment, basically.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.462]  And they would align themselves behind a new, I would imagine, a new currency.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:32.227]  Uh, and if we're all trading the same currency, then you're moving more towards the idea of a new order, a new world order of things.
[00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:40.494]  And I didn't say that to just scare everybody, and I know there's all the stuff out there, but likely some type of a new order, I would guess.
[00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:43.157]  Well, that's what the elite themselves are calling it.
[00:11:43.897 --> 00:11:44.478]  Stay there.
[00:11:44.998 --> 00:11:46.420]  Damon Vickers is our guest.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:54.248]  Damon Vickers dot com fund manager, nine points capital partners, chief investment officer.
[00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:55.850]  He's our guest for the rest of the hour.
[00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.072]  This is going to be some important information.
[00:11:58.092 --> 00:11:58.552]  Stay with us.
[00:12:00.114 --> 00:12:02.136]  When you hear the words water purification,

[00:14:00.824 --> 00:14:02.506]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[00:14:02.806 --> 00:14:03.147]  November 16, 2009.
[00:14:03.207 --> 00:14:04.288]  Gold opened this morning at $11.2960.

[00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:33.255]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:41.982]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:43.163]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:47.426]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:14:47.626 --> 00:14:48.827]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:48.887 --> 00:14:53.430]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.370]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:56.332 --> 00:14:59.193]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:00.114]  Hello!
[00:15:00.434 --> 00:15:04.837]  At OfTheField.com we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:15:05.117 --> 00:15:09.520]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.722]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:15:14.922 --> 00:15:19.784]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[00:15:20.104 --> 00:15:21.064]  Boy, was I wrong.
[00:15:21.344 --> 00:15:24.385]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[00:15:24.486 --> 00:15:28.307]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[00:15:28.367 --> 00:15:31.348]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[00:15:31.588 --> 00:15:31.968]  Wow!
[00:15:32.128 --> 00:15:33.369]  I watched the DVD last night.
[00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:34.729]  I was awestruck.
[00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:36.370]  What wonderful work you have done.
[00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.711]  This information can bless many people.
[00:15:39.091 --> 00:15:40.172]  Thank you again.
[00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:40.852]  Thanks again.
[00:15:41.032 --> 00:15:43.955]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[00:15:44.175 --> 00:15:44.555]  Thank you.
[00:15:44.755 --> 00:15:47.777]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[00:16:03.168 --> 00:16:05.149]  You look like an angel
[00:16:07.831 --> 00:16:11.080]  Walk like an angel.
[00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:13.106]  Talk like an angel.
[00:16:21.528 --> 00:16:26.473]  DamonVickers.com, he's our guest, Chief Investment Officer with Nine Points Management & Research.
[00:16:26.813 --> 00:16:33.600]  This is a short segment, but in the long segment, we're going to be taking some phone calls, your questions or comments for Damon Vickers.
[00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:35.302]  The toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:35.322 --> 00:16:36.843]  Specifically questions for our guest,
[00:16:41.648 --> 00:16:43.689]  On any investment issue, you can get his take on it.
[00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:50.274]  Okay, let's finish up with the New World Order, where you see the markets going, where you see gold going, how you see this crisis shaking out.
[00:16:50.294 --> 00:16:56.317]  I know you don't have a complete crystal ball, nobody does, but your best dead reckoning on where we're going.
[00:16:56.337 --> 00:17:05.203]  But when you talk about New World Order, talk about global government, studying that, how do you see it forming, what do you see it making up, what do you see its policies being?
[00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:10.904]  Well, that's a big one to cover.
[00:17:10.924 --> 00:17:18.651]  There's a trend, which is what we do.
[00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:19.932]  I mean, I'm a trend follower.
[00:17:20.432 --> 00:17:23.074]  So, the trend for the markets last year were down.
[00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:24.595]  We want to make money from that.
[00:17:24.655 --> 00:17:26.797]  We really don't care which direction the market goes.
[00:17:26.817 --> 00:17:29.099]  If the market wants to go higher, great, we want to be there.
[00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:31.241]  If the market wants to go lower, great, we want to be there.
[00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:35.445]  Gold, I got really excited about gold when it broke through $1,000 an ounce.
[00:17:35.525 --> 00:17:38.488]  I also got, we had gotten a long oil at the same time.
[00:17:38.548 --> 00:17:39.769]  Both assets are going up.
[00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:48.178]  We're making money in both of them, and we're doing really well with it today, because as we speak, gold is hitting a new high and oil's up about $3 a barrel.
[00:17:48.959 --> 00:17:54.745]  When I saw that happening, and this was the same thing that was happening last year, when I saw the break,
[00:17:55.601 --> 00:18:03.168]  Last year in the financials, there was a week last year where the banking index broke support.
[00:18:03.869 --> 00:18:09.293]  I sent out a release to all the media, and the title of that release was called, On the Eve of Destruction.
[00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:14.238]  The week that followed that, we had the worst week in market history.
[00:18:14.258 --> 00:18:16.460]  We went down like 20-some-odd percent for the week.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.724]  It was horrific for most, great for us, and we made money that week.
[00:18:21.585 --> 00:18:32.209]  When I saw gold break through $1,000, that kind of felt like a tell to me that this would also involve the currency, which is the dollar, which we've also seen.
[00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:40.372]  So, gold breaking through $1,000 really says that the dollar is likely to come under increasing, increasing pressure.
[00:18:41.232 --> 00:18:47.254]  The dollar coming increasing pressure means an accelerated loss of value and an accelerated rise.
[00:18:48.014 --> 00:18:49.015]  We're good to go.
[00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:17.174]  Of purchasing power for Americans may be really profound.
[00:19:17.194 --> 00:19:18.916]  What do we know about the dollar?
[00:19:18.956 --> 00:19:26.764]  We know that the dollar already, Alex, as I'm sure you know, the dollar has lost about 97% of its value since 1971, since Nixon cut the cord to the dollar.
[00:19:26.784 --> 00:19:27.625]  It lost 97%.
[00:19:35.612 --> 00:19:39.853]  And so, you know, the government has done all these things to try to shore up the economy, right?
[00:19:40.073 --> 00:19:43.034]  You know, we had the equity bubble in 2000, and then the burst.
[00:19:43.554 --> 00:19:46.455]  And then they go together, well, what can we do to keep this all going?
[00:19:46.475 --> 00:19:46.975]  And what do they do?
[00:19:47.035 --> 00:19:47.875]  They printed money.
[00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:49.816]  They deregulated the financial system.
[00:19:50.016 --> 00:19:53.637]  We had a separation between banks and brokerage firms, right?
[00:19:53.917 --> 00:19:55.958]  Because we'd learned lessons from the crash of 1929.
[00:19:58.159 --> 00:19:58.339]  What?
[00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:01.503]  We dissolved that, and banks and brokerage firms got together.
[00:20:01.943 --> 00:20:07.210]  Banks could then make risky bets with your deposits, which is exactly what they did.
[00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.033]  And this was all to juice up the economy in 2002-2003.
[00:20:10.253 --> 00:20:16.261]  So we juiced up the economy, and we created the second bubble, which was the real estate bubble.
[00:20:16.941 --> 00:20:17.802]  They took the bait!
[00:20:36.715 --> 00:20:37.075]  We're good to go.
[00:20:56.441 --> 00:20:58.562]  And then we run into a crisis.
[00:20:58.582 --> 00:21:00.703]  Basically, there's no more sources of funding left.
[00:21:01.143 --> 00:21:04.104]  Last year was a crisis of funding.
[00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:10.207]  You could no longer find anybody to finance the economy, because that's what we were doing.
[00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:14.049]  We were selling these swaps on a global basis.
[00:21:14.109 --> 00:21:17.310]  We almost bankrupted Iceland, or virtually did bankrupt the country.
[00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.712]  And, you know, we look at Madoff and say he was a horrific guy.
[00:21:21.772 --> 00:21:22.872]  And the guy was no saint.
[00:21:23.092 --> 00:21:24.213]  He did some very evil things.
[00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:39.857]  But here in the United States, and here we as Americans, we have floated out this toxic garbage to the entire planet to finance our illusion of a lifestyle.
[00:21:39.877 --> 00:21:41.937]  Let's talk about that on the other side.
[00:21:42.017 --> 00:21:49.459]  Quick break, we'll come back, finish up there, get into your forecast for the future, and take phone calls with our guest, Damon Vickers.
[00:21:49.839 --> 00:21:50.799]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.760]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.776 --> 00:21:56.446]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:02.496]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:02.897 --> 00:22:07.859]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:08.219 --> 00:22:09.960]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:10.281 --> 00:22:15.103]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:15.283 --> 00:22:16.244]  How much do you want?
[00:22:16.464 --> 00:22:17.204]  When do you want it?
[00:22:17.584 --> 00:22:19.185]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:22:19.465 --> 00:22:20.286]  When will you need it?
[00:22:20.546 --> 00:22:22.607]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:22.747 --> 00:22:23.848]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:24.088 --> 00:22:25.389]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:26.069 --> 00:22:27.990]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.671]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:22:30.871 --> 00:22:34.053]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:37.955]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:22:38.275 --> 00:22:39.255]  How much will you need?
[00:22:39.495 --> 00:22:40.116]  We don't know.
[00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:41.316]  How much do you want?
[00:22:41.496 --> 00:22:42.237]  All you can get.
[00:22:42.437 --> 00:22:43.137]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:43.517 --> 00:22:43.937]  I think so.
[00:22:58.874 --> 00:23:04.061]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:08.567]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:08.727 --> 00:23:10.570]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.352]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:12.612 --> 00:23:13.654]  There is a solution.
[00:23:13.874 --> 00:23:21.916]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.061]  I love their Nutri Cafe.

[00:23:58.834 --> 00:24:05.680]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.041]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:24:07.081 --> 00:24:07.741]  It's very real.

[00:24:11.785 --> 00:24:16.128]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:25:07.227 --> 00:25:10.509]  We're going to be taking calls coming up here in about five, six minutes for our guest.
[00:25:10.529 --> 00:25:16.233]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:16.593 --> 00:25:20.235]  Damon Vickers from Nine Points Management and Research.
[00:25:20.275 --> 00:25:27.480]  DamonVickers.com is our guest, and I'm going to really enjoy having him on from time to time here on the radio show.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.903]  Very, very excited to have him here with us.
[00:25:30.923 --> 00:25:33.166]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors before we go back to him.
[00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:36.670]  One of them is a Cola Blue, the atmospheric water generator.
[00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.174]  It looks like a water cooler, a high-tech water cooler with no water bottle on the top.
[00:25:40.634 --> 00:25:42.316]  It grabs water out of the air.
[00:25:43.317 --> 00:25:45.799]  It's like evil carbon dioxide that Al Gore wants to tax.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.103]  Well, water must be evil too because it's in our atmosphere.
[00:25:49.543 --> 00:25:57.250]  And it grabs it out of the air, puts it through seven filters, reverse osmosis, you name it, and stores it in an illuminated stainless steel tank in the bottom.
[00:25:57.631 --> 00:25:58.872]  Seven and a half gallons a day.
[00:25:58.912 --> 00:25:59.953]  That's their small unit.
[00:25:59.973 --> 00:26:00.734]  They have bigger units.
[00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:02.795]  They've got them on hand right now.
[00:26:02.835 --> 00:26:06.739]  The Ecolablue 28 is their most economical model.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.542]  Ecolablue, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[00:26:09.562 --> 00:26:11.884]  The best, cleanest drinking water you can get anywhere.
[00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:13.486]  And lastly, a plug for the online video bookstore.
[00:26:13.506 --> 00:26:14.366]  It is the Holliday
[00:26:27.401 --> 00:26:28.543]  Season right now.
[00:26:28.563 --> 00:26:32.188]  Don't want to be politically incorrect and say Christmas, but it is Christmas.
[00:26:32.969 --> 00:26:33.350]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:33.951]  I apologize.
[00:26:34.031 --> 00:26:35.192]  I celebrate Christmas for everybody.
[00:26:35.212 --> 00:26:37.295]  I may be arrested in this new world order.
[00:26:37.656 --> 00:26:39.018]  But fall of the Republic.
[00:26:39.058 --> 00:26:42.963]  Give the gift of truth this holiday season.
[00:26:43.524 --> 00:26:44.505]  Here is the new cover.
[00:26:44.545 --> 00:26:46.726]  We had one with Obama on the front, but I like this one better.
[00:26:47.166 --> 00:26:50.628]  It's got the Statue of Liberty plunging downward with Obama down here on the bottom.
[00:26:50.928 --> 00:26:52.048]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:26:52.088 --> 00:26:54.410]  Two-hour, 24-minute film with a bunch of extras.
[00:26:54.670 --> 00:27:01.573]  Who the bankers are, what their new rule order is, what they're setting up, the police state control grid, the mind control of the television.
[00:27:01.893 --> 00:27:03.274]  This is really my best work.
[00:27:03.414 --> 00:27:04.415]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:27:04.735 --> 00:27:05.895]  Give the gift of truth.
[00:27:06.316 --> 00:27:08.517]  This is a film that shatters the left-right paradigm.
[00:27:08.797 --> 00:27:09.857]  This is my best work.
[00:27:10.218 --> 00:27:10.718]  You can get it
[00:27:12.054 --> 00:27:12.415]  Free!
[00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:17.961]  You can get Fall of the Republic, and then get an interview with Aaron Russo, Reflections and Warnings, on DVD.
[00:27:18.742 --> 00:27:23.367]  This documentary film, 90 minutes long, absolutely free, and one of the combo deals.
[00:27:23.387 --> 00:27:28.493]  There's a bunch of other specials at InfoWars.com, or ask about the specials when you call 888-253-2543.
[00:27:30.956 --> 00:27:31.517]  We're good
[00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:54.336]  Five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv where all my films are posted and we simulcast the radio show in living color.
[00:27:54.356 --> 00:27:58.019]  I want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:00.401]  Okay, going back to Damon Vickers.
[00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:06.906]  Damon, we were getting in to the New World Order, what's being set up, what you see happening in the future.
[00:28:07.286 --> 00:28:10.109]  Tell me, where do you, how high do you think gold may go?
[00:28:10.489 --> 00:28:11.650]  What's the time frame there?
[00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.551]  And then you were posing the question to me during the break,
[00:28:14.272 --> 00:28:15.612]  Well, we're going to have a New World Order.
[00:28:15.632 --> 00:28:20.714]  I mean, you're saying the dollar is pretty much going to collapse, a new system, but who's going to run that New World Order?
[00:28:20.934 --> 00:28:22.274]  So, David Vickers, break it down.
[00:28:23.394 --> 00:28:32.037]  Yeah, one of the things that you say, Alex, that I love, amongst some other things you talk about, there are those that are kind of conservative clones.
[00:28:32.057 --> 00:28:33.477]  You know, there are a couple of them on the radio.
[00:28:34.706 --> 00:28:42.852]  There are a number of people that are the other way, and that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are worth anything.
[00:28:43.253 --> 00:28:47.596]  That it's a total fantasy, one way or the other, that we participate in every four and eight years.
[00:28:49.898 --> 00:28:51.859]  So it's not working.
[00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:53.320]  The other thing is that there is not...
[00:28:54.681 --> 00:28:59.526]  Historically, all paper currencies have historically lost all their value.
[00:29:00.787 --> 00:29:15.180]  The problem is that as the population and the governments unfold, basically what they do is we vote in people that just give out all this largesse to the general population.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:23.505]  You know, the population wants to continue to pile on all these pennies and benefits and special projects.
[00:29:23.665 --> 00:29:25.126]  And it's not just the United States.
[00:29:25.706 --> 00:29:26.766]  It's all over the planet.
[00:29:26.826 --> 00:29:34.711]  And the way that we do that is it's very easy, since the currency is not based on anything, to just print money.
[00:29:35.031 --> 00:29:37.292]  So the currencies get debased.
[00:29:37.393 --> 00:29:40.594]  And inevitably, the currencies basically get wiped out.
[00:29:42.056 --> 00:30:05.737]  It's kind of a long-term historical cycle that we seem to go in, which is you get this debasement of the currency and a kind of a laissez-faire environment, which I think the speculation of the last ten years with the internet and the crazy real estate bubbles and putting Donald Trump back on TV, which was, if there was ever a sign of the new world order and a sign of the apocalypse, maybe it was Donald coming back to life.
[00:30:06.637 --> 00:30:28.528]  And then you get the arrival, you get a disintegration of the government, a disintegration of order, right, of kind of chaos, and then desperation of the general population, and then the arrival of a focused focal point, or a kind of a more of a fascist national
[00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:33.049]  Kind of a dictatorship, really.
[00:30:33.209 --> 00:30:37.391]  You know, you saw it with the arrival of Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, this type of thing.
[00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:43.152]  I know it's hard to imagine that we could see anything like that in the United States, but it's a possibility.
[00:30:43.652 --> 00:30:52.735]  And so what we need to do is decide whether or not this is going to be a controlled landing, right, or it's going to be a total utter crash.
[00:30:52.975 --> 00:30:53.936]  Well, let me throw this in.
[00:30:55.953 --> 00:30:59.217]  David, I mean, Damon Vickers, the whole issue here is...
[00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:04.576]  Speaking of David, David Rockefeller and others have stated what their plan is.
[00:31:04.616 --> 00:31:07.218]  They have implemented this implosion.
[00:31:07.558 --> 00:31:13.342]  Maury Strong talks about implementing this implosion on its ashes to build the new international architecture.
[00:31:13.682 --> 00:31:23.528]  They're telling the public none of this change exists while the UN Secretary General writes editorials calling for global government and global carbon taxes so that we're not part of the debate.
[00:31:24.028 --> 00:31:27.691]  They're just denying it's even happening while in serious intellectual debate
[00:31:28.591 --> 00:31:30.773]  It's all being erected and set up right now.
[00:31:31.293 --> 00:31:41.241]  And so my problem is, one of their higher level sales pitches they use is to say, oh, the question is, what type of world government, what type of new world order do you want?
[00:31:41.521 --> 00:31:44.323]  Well, how about we have a new world order where we don't have a world government?
[00:31:44.563 --> 00:31:49.407]  How about we have a new world order where the central bankers engineering these Ponzi schemes go to jail?
[00:31:49.807 --> 00:32:01.930]  How about we have a New World Order where we have a global declaration of independence and national sovereignty instead of being maneuvered into, well, okay then, do you want to have a say in what type of New World Order are we going to have?
[00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:06.092]  The elite setting up this system won't even allow a real debate.
[00:32:06.372 --> 00:32:13.454]  They ridicule anyone that, you know, Limbaugh, Hannity, they still won't even admit this is happening after decades of saying it doesn't exist.
[00:32:15.234 --> 00:32:16.975]  I mean, you understand where I'm going with this.
[00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:20.957]  We don't have a say in how this government changes.
[00:32:21.017 --> 00:32:26.460]  And I understand it's sold as an evolution and a new world order, but the new world order has been engineered.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:26.820]  Go ahead.
[00:32:27.301 --> 00:32:28.041]  Okay.
[00:32:28.081 --> 00:32:33.364]  We can debate things, add an item, and yet nothing will get accomplished and nothing will get done.
[00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:37.086]  We're all afraid of change.
[00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:40.328]  We're all afraid of things arriving that we don't know anything about.
[00:32:41.621 --> 00:33:07.170]  But I think we have to all agree and admit to ourselves that the present order of things, the order of wiping out fish stocks, the order of wiping out, you know, the resources, and everybody believes that they have the sovereign right to rape and pillage their forests and their, you know, the world's nature, which... I know, but the globalists always say...
[00:33:09.246 --> 00:33:14.669]  I know, but the globalists always say they're doing this to stop it when they are the progenitors of most of it.
[00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:33.241]  Well, I think there's a desire for certain people to try to bring order to a world that is entirely disorderly and headed towards what could be unfathomably about suffering.
[00:33:33.502 --> 00:33:37.884]  We've got a billion people on the planet right now, Alex, that are starving right now.
[00:33:38.024 --> 00:33:38.685]  A billion of them.
[00:33:39.285 --> 00:33:41.306]  That's a very large percentage of the population.
[00:33:41.366 --> 00:33:47.950]  We can look in the United States, how many people are, what do they say, one out of five kids' families are in food stamps right now.
[00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.172]  Clearly, clearly the order that we have right now is not working.
[00:33:51.212 --> 00:33:52.713]  We need something new.
[00:33:53.234 --> 00:34:01.799]  I understand that there are a lot of problems and crises, but when I read the Royal Commission on Population, secretly put out by the British government, now declassified,
[00:34:02.539 --> 00:34:15.264]  50 years ago, they said we're going to create globalization to control the third world, we're going to keep them from industrializing, even though that would clean up the environment and lower their numbers, because we're going to let the people bomb be used as a weapon against them.
[00:34:15.644 --> 00:34:23.747]  Just like the UN claims... We never should have gone into the third world in the first place, and every time that we go in there, we create more havoc.
[00:34:23.907 --> 00:34:29.849]  Even the compassionate things that we do, in terms of providing aid and care to them, only further exacerbates the
[00:34:31.613 --> 00:34:32.673]  Well, Damon, let me just say this.
[00:34:32.693 --> 00:34:41.937]  I totally understand where you're coming from when you say the existing order is a bunch of criminal pirates raping and pillaging and looting.
[00:34:42.317 --> 00:34:44.898]  The problem is... This is where we agree.
[00:34:44.918 --> 00:34:46.199]  This is where we agree, Alex.
[00:34:47.148 --> 00:34:49.350]  But, it's a two-face.
[00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:51.812]  You've got two faces, one here and one on the back.
[00:34:52.233 --> 00:34:54.074]  The globalists are the pirates.
[00:34:54.475 --> 00:35:08.427]  They then rotate their face around as the saviors, and everything they're proposing just gives them more power and has this frosting, this sugar coating of helping the poor and helping the environment.
[00:35:08.888 --> 00:35:12.211]  I mean, if they wanted to help the environment, they'd be restricting genetic engineering.
[00:35:13.939 --> 00:35:18.722]  David Rockefeller, and I know it's convenient to demonize the Rockefellers, okay?
[00:35:19.303 --> 00:35:26.307]  But we wouldn't have much of the national park system in the United States if it weren't for Lawrence Rockefeller.
[00:35:26.327 --> 00:35:27.889]  There'd be no Teton National Park.
[00:35:27.909 --> 00:35:28.629]  There'd be no U.S.
[00:35:28.669 --> 00:35:29.910]  Virgin Islands National Park.
[00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.872]  There'd be no Acadia National Park.
[00:35:32.912 --> 00:35:35.474]  There'd be no... I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:35:35.554 --> 00:35:37.015]  These are people that long ago
[00:35:37.717 --> 00:35:47.003]  They made a tremendous amount of wealth, and then they began to turn their wealth to greater causes in trying to serve humanity.
[00:35:47.383 --> 00:35:52.907]  I think all of us would agree that none of us like seeing suffering.
[00:35:53.667 --> 00:36:03.334]  And to the extent that we can move the planet towards alleviating human suffering and more balance, I think we're heading in the right direction.
[00:36:04.339 --> 00:36:14.423]  Hey, Damon, I appreciate you coming on and I want to have you back up again because this is intriguing, but this is the slick New World Order sales job because I recognize what you're doing.
[00:36:14.463 --> 00:36:17.805]  I've heard this from other high-powered people.
[00:36:17.845 --> 00:36:19.846]  Hold on, but I've been given this speech before.
[00:36:19.926 --> 00:36:20.366]  Hold on.
[00:36:20.726 --> 00:36:22.087]  I've been given this speech before.
[00:36:22.387 --> 00:36:27.469]  What I'm telling you is the fruits of the people captaining our planet right now.
[00:36:28.668 --> 00:36:31.290]  Look, the Rockefellers set up eugenics.
[00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.171]  The Rockefellers set up CPSing people's children and the family courts.
[00:36:35.211 --> 00:36:37.873]  They set up the Human Genome Project in Cold Springs Harbor.
[00:36:38.333 --> 00:36:43.816]  I understand they also set up some of the national parks because they wanted places where there were no people.
[00:36:44.316 --> 00:36:49.479]  That's good.
[00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:52.880]  Well, you know, what do we do?
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:58.003]  Our nation, the United States, enjoys a very high standard of living.
[00:36:59.007 --> 00:37:03.688]  Yes, we're an obese, decadent society that won't even engage in birth control, so we just abort our babies.
[00:37:03.728 --> 00:37:07.469]  We're a throwaway society, and so now we're being thrown away by the global system.
[00:37:29.651 --> 00:37:30.611]  I think so.
[00:37:52.995 --> 00:37:58.462]  Well, I'll tell you this, a lot of them are doing better now than they were just 20 years ago.
[00:37:58.482 --> 00:38:00.104]  I'll grant you that.
[00:38:00.664 --> 00:38:05.330]  But that's the globalist sales pitch, is guilt to what's left of the middle class here.
[00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:12.463]  But then our money, what's left of us gets transferred to the bankers.
[00:38:12.503 --> 00:38:13.903]  It doesn't get to some African.
[00:38:13.963 --> 00:38:16.324]  No desire to do that.
[00:38:16.344 --> 00:38:28.429]  We've got a rising unemployment rate and the reason why we have a rising unemployment rate is we simply cannot match the unit cost, the labor cost, the unit cost of production that can be achieved in Vietnam and Bang and Creek.
[00:38:29.093 --> 00:38:36.659]  But how does lowering our standard of living, when it's all fiat to begin with, how does that help Africa and Asia and Latin America?
[00:38:36.699 --> 00:38:40.382]  That's actually going to hurt them because they're not even going to have their customer anymore.
[00:38:40.603 --> 00:38:50.391]  This is how globalization and the giant sucking sound, the race to the bottom, destroys all sides in the end except for the finance oligarchs.
[00:38:51.596 --> 00:38:56.539]  If we don't try to create some type of a balance globally, Alex, we will be raising the cost.
[00:38:56.559 --> 00:38:57.579]  All right, let me ask you this.
[00:38:57.619 --> 00:38:59.500]  Let me ask you this, then, because you are an honest guy.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.361]  We'll talk about the truth on national television.
[00:39:01.741 --> 00:39:06.304]  What do we do, then, if Damon Vickers was steering things, what would you do?
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:17.971]  Well, I think we have to create a global environment whereby we have balance.
[00:39:18.132 --> 00:39:21.215]  And that's essentially the problem, I think, on a planetary basis.
[00:39:21.255 --> 00:39:23.218]  We're living out of balance.
[00:39:23.798 --> 00:39:25.719]  Our own country is out of balance.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:34.445]  We cannot go and take a million tons of herring out of the ocean and know that it doesn't affect the whales.
[00:39:34.686 --> 00:39:50.696]  The oceans are really running out of fish right now, but the issue here is, again I want to go back to this, the issue is realizing that heaven is a place that is something that we, that the closest, our fondest imagining of what heaven is, is here on our planet.
[00:39:50.716 --> 00:39:52.638]  We need to take care of the planet that we live in.
[00:39:53.238 --> 00:39:55.840]  And not be raping it and think it's ours to exploit.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.921]  We have to sustain our home.
[00:39:58.402 --> 00:39:59.943]  And we're not treating it respectfully.
[00:40:00.003 --> 00:40:02.845]  Well I'll tell you this, putting a tax on carbon isn't going to do that.
[00:40:08.743 --> 00:40:18.612]  But Damon, putting a tax on carbon dioxide is a giant distraction from real environmental policies that we could agree to carry out and make profitable.
[00:40:18.772 --> 00:40:21.835]  I mean, the government that we have in place right now is a total disaster.
[00:40:21.855 --> 00:40:26.259]  This whole move towards health care is just insane.
[00:40:26.539 --> 00:40:32.504]  Our government has become a giant tumor, a malignant tumor that is sucking the life out of this country.
[00:40:32.565 --> 00:40:33.105]  It's horrific.
[00:40:36.053 --> 00:40:37.213]  But, Damon, that's my point.
[00:40:37.293 --> 00:40:45.296]  It's the same globalists that brought us into imbalance, certainly nudged us in that way, using our own weaknesses to get us dependent on them.
[00:40:45.696 --> 00:40:51.978]  They got us dependent in this large-ass, decadent, laissez-faire welfare system so that we could be controlled.
[00:40:52.058 --> 00:40:53.338]  I have their own documents.
[00:40:53.418 --> 00:41:00.480]  They brag that they engineered this, and then now they're offering the solution that sounds somewhat similar to what you're saying.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.321]  I'm saying the problem is, it's a setup.
[00:41:06.351 --> 00:41:09.874]  Well, I'd say that the participants also set themselves up.
[00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:14.778]  I mean, you're talking about, you've got an addict and you've got a drug dealer.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:23.005]  There's no doubt that there's a dealer establishment, but the addict is also partly to blame for their own behavior.
[00:41:23.845 --> 00:41:29.730]  Yeah, well I agree to a certain extent, but that's like saying a 10-year-old who gets kidnapped, it's partly their fault.
[00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:35.035]  And it is true, they went in the front yard, they went down the street, they talked to strangers, they wanted to see the puppy dog.
[00:41:36.894 --> 00:41:39.456]  You know, we've got real challenges ahead of us.
[00:41:39.796 --> 00:41:41.677]  The dollar is disintegrating.
[00:41:41.777 --> 00:41:42.318]  We know that.
[00:41:42.398 --> 00:41:43.939]  That's what's currently happening right now.
[00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:45.940]  The dollar is losing value.
[00:41:46.481 --> 00:41:50.263]  Pretty much every day that the market is open is a day to sell more dollars.
[00:41:51.304 --> 00:41:52.244]  Gold is rising.
[00:41:52.505 --> 00:41:53.285]  Oil is rising.
[00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:56.347]  And it's not just the dollar that's weak.
[00:41:56.407 --> 00:42:00.490]  It's also the currencies in the United Kingdom, and it's also the other westernized nations.
[00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:05.794]  Because none of these countries are really viable-going concerns.
[00:42:06.714 --> 00:42:08.015]  We don't export anything.
[00:42:08.436 --> 00:42:10.437]  And we can't produce things.
[00:42:10.737 --> 00:42:12.879]  Globalism did this to us.
[00:42:12.919 --> 00:42:14.980]  Tax incentives to move overseas.
[00:42:15.961 --> 00:42:18.302]  I know, but we were set up, we were pushed into this.
[00:42:18.382 --> 00:42:19.623]  Big government did this.
[00:42:22.045 --> 00:42:27.189]  Well, I think it's just, it's kind of a cycle of how societies run.
[00:42:27.909 --> 00:42:29.030]  No, I agree with you.
[00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:30.331]  How high is gold going to go?
[00:42:31.707 --> 00:42:32.387]  Hard to say.
[00:42:32.447 --> 00:42:33.668]  This is an incredible interview, Damon Vickers.
[00:42:33.708 --> 00:42:36.950]  I'm going to try to twist his arm maybe 10, 15 in the next hour so we can take these calls.
[00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.071]  This guy, he's giving me a run for my money.
[00:42:39.091 --> 00:42:39.751]  He may be Beelzebub.
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.401]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:43:01.961 --> 00:43:04.642]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:43:05.222 --> 00:43:08.803]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:43:09.644 --> 00:43:18.567]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:20.768]  Rely instead on OxySilver.
[00:43:21.108 --> 00:43:26.510]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:31.594]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:43:32.235 --> 00:43:36.939]  It works so well, saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[00:43:36.959 --> 00:43:40.041]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:43:40.322 --> 00:43:44.805]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[00:43:45.846 --> 00:43:48.668]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[00:43:49.128 --> 00:43:52.070]  Call toll-free 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:54.672]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:43:55.152 --> 00:43:56.533]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:43:56.773 --> 00:43:58.174]  This call could save your life.
[00:44:00.676 --> 00:44:04.339]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:07.681]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:07.921 --> 00:44:09.342]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.701]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:12.721 --> 00:44:18.963]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:19.103 --> 00:44:24.125]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:24.645 --> 00:44:34.289]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:34.389 --> 00:44:36.510]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:38.071]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:38.331 --> 00:44:40.613]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:40.793 --> 00:44:42.654]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:42.914 --> 00:44:47.677]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:48.078 --> 00:44:57.183]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:01.343 --> 00:45:02.484]  This is not a drill.
[00:45:02.564 --> 00:45:04.545]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:45:05.065 --> 00:45:06.686]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:45:06.986 --> 00:45:14.110]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:18.552]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:45:18.592 --> 00:45:21.154]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques.
[00:45:21.214 --> 00:45:23.995]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[00:45:24.035 --> 00:45:25.176]  How to create the perfect
[00:45:25.336 --> 00:45:25.776]  We're good.
[00:45:49.036 --> 00:45:53.678]  Alright folks, I got one more silver dollar and they're not gonna catch me.
[00:45:53.718 --> 00:45:56.339]  No, I'm not gonna let them catch me.
[00:45:56.379 --> 00:46:03.622]  Not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.
[00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:21.491]  I'll tell you, this is an impressive interview, and I look forward to future debates with him.
[00:46:22.591 --> 00:46:26.532]  We really appreciate Damon Vickers, DamonVickers.com, coming on with us.
[00:46:26.992 --> 00:46:38.394]  He is the Chief Investment Officer with Nine Points Management and Research, and he's one of the nicer, formerly East Coast Blue Bloods here, hooked up with the Rockefellers and others.
[00:46:39.434 --> 00:46:43.875]  And he is talking about the world government coming in, and he is talking about
[00:46:45.239 --> 00:46:46.099]  The end of the dollar.
[00:46:46.819 --> 00:46:51.221]  And we're going to, when we start the next hour, take your calls for all of you that are holding.
[00:46:51.921 --> 00:46:55.522]  Shanky, Andrew, Karen, Anita, and others.
[00:46:55.602 --> 00:46:59.163]  But just briefly, we were talking during the break.
[00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:02.064]  You're saying, look, I grew up in a Buddhist monastery or lived in one.
[00:47:02.084 --> 00:47:02.904]  I'm not Beelzebub.
[00:47:02.944 --> 00:47:03.484]  That was a joke.
[00:47:03.524 --> 00:47:04.944]  I apologize.
[00:47:05.325 --> 00:47:07.245]  I just meant you speak with a silver tongue.
[00:47:07.645 --> 00:47:09.766]  And I understand it's a very convincing argument.
[00:47:10.106 --> 00:47:14.047]  But are you saying world government is a foregone conclusion?
[00:47:16.673 --> 00:47:18.114]  Gave up all of that stuff.
[00:47:18.214 --> 00:47:19.394]  Gave up the Brooks Brothers.
[00:47:19.454 --> 00:47:20.555]  Gave up all that stuff.
[00:47:20.835 --> 00:47:24.076]  And I would sit and meditate with my father at 530 in the morning.
[00:47:24.436 --> 00:47:26.317]  I lived in a monastery called Odeon.
[00:47:26.357 --> 00:47:28.638]  I'm one of only three kids that ever lived there.
[00:47:28.998 --> 00:47:32.340]  It's on 1100 acres and it's a Tibetan Buddhist monastery.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.120]  But for real.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.242]  And what they're all about is trying to alleviate human suffering.
[00:47:37.742 --> 00:47:44.365]  So all of us would agree that suffering is something that we want to avoid and that we don't like seeing others
[00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:47.302]  Yeah, but you're saying the system's bad we've got now.
[00:47:47.482 --> 00:47:49.022]  We'd like to see our planet suffer.
[00:47:49.482 --> 00:47:52.423]  And that we are living out of balance.
[00:47:53.544 --> 00:47:59.886]  And that we need to get not only the United States back into balance, but the world back into balance.
[00:48:00.066 --> 00:48:02.327]  As Prince Philip says, we need to cull.
[00:48:02.947 --> 00:48:04.767]  Prince Philip says we need to cull 80%.
[00:48:04.807 --> 00:48:06.728]  You're not for culling people, are you?
[00:48:08.044 --> 00:48:18.228]  No, I'm not for calling people, but on the other hand, you've got, if you're a West Indian down in the Caribbean, you think it's your right to have 28 kids.
[00:48:18.448 --> 00:48:18.948]  And they do.
[00:48:19.148 --> 00:48:19.648]  I've met them.
[00:48:20.208 --> 00:48:21.429]  And it's not sustainable.
[00:48:21.909 --> 00:48:26.811]  Many of those islands in the Caribbean, they were paradise, and now they're not paradise at all.
[00:48:27.111 --> 00:48:28.091]  Well, let me ask you this, then.
[00:48:28.151 --> 00:48:28.851]  Let me ask you this.
[00:48:28.971 --> 00:48:29.532]  Here's the deal.
[00:48:34.605 --> 00:48:36.106]  Here's what I have to say to you, though.
[00:48:36.686 --> 00:48:45.631]  That's why I made Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, my film about eugenics, because I agree with you that we should have a debate about this, and people should know.
[00:48:46.111 --> 00:48:55.395]  All these people eating McDonald's hamburgers, living in trailers, partying, watching porn, and having abortions, they don't realize that the elite have decided to kill their butts.
[00:48:57.253 --> 00:48:59.874]  I mean, I'm just glad that you're just being honest about all this.
[00:49:00.034 --> 00:49:01.755]  I'm not saying you're calling for killing people.
[00:49:02.116 --> 00:49:08.979]  You know, you're kind of the soft touch in all this, but I'm telling you, this is real, and the public better grow up and get off their fat butts.
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:16.903]  Our planet cannot support every one of us going out there and having 24 and 28 kids.
[00:49:16.963 --> 00:49:18.504]  It's just, there's not enough.
[00:49:21.681 --> 00:49:22.762]  Well, here's another problem.
[00:49:22.962 --> 00:49:25.503]  Only educated people are dying out.
[00:49:25.843 --> 00:49:28.744]  The West has 1.3 replacement for every two adults.
[00:49:29.145 --> 00:49:34.447]  And so, the West is saying they want to target the West for no one to have kids.
[00:49:34.487 --> 00:49:37.829]  So, the West has to die, and then everybody else can have 500 kids?
[00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:53.448]  No, nobody needs to be targeted, but we need to recognize and come into common understanding and belief about what our relationship is to one another, and what our relationship is to the planet that we live on, and try to live responsibly.
[00:49:53.488 --> 00:49:57.771]  And having 16 and 28 kids is not responsible.
[00:49:58.572 --> 00:49:59.733]  I think all of us could agree to that.
[00:49:59.753 --> 00:50:00.654]  Wouldn't you agree to that, Alex?
[00:50:01.774 --> 00:50:05.738]  But, the minute you don't let somebody have 10 kids, then you can't have two.
[00:50:07.688 --> 00:50:14.970]  Okay, and there are nations that believe it's their right to deforest their rainforests, but these are the lungs of the planet.
[00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:16.090]  Should they be allowed to do that?
[00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:17.590]  Because it's their sovereign right?
[00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:20.811]  Well, the nations, that's the oil companies.
[00:50:21.731 --> 00:50:23.872]  And Al Gore owns Occidental Petroleum.
[00:50:23.892 --> 00:50:25.332]  He isn't calling for stopping that.
[00:50:25.772 --> 00:50:27.433]  He wants to tax what plants breathe.
[00:50:27.453 --> 00:50:28.153]  That's what I mean.
[00:50:29.113 --> 00:50:29.914]  We're just evil.
[00:50:30.254 --> 00:50:32.676]  And no matter what we do, it's going to hell in the handbasket.
[00:50:32.936 --> 00:50:36.480]  And all these globalists have these great reasons we should sell out to them.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.221]  But that brings more destruction.
[00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:38.682]  Stay with us.
[00:50:40.844 --> 00:50:42.945]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:43.466 --> 00:50:46.629]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:52.865]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:50:53.165 --> 00:50:53.786]  Number one.
[00:50:54.086 --> 00:50:57.249]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:50:57.509 --> 00:50:58.070]  Number two.
[00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:02.914]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:03.255 --> 00:51:03.715]  It's true.
[00:51:04.016 --> 00:51:08.560]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.421]  Number 3.
[00:51:09.681 --> 00:51:12.964]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:13.284 --> 00:51:17.007]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:17.208 --> 00:51:17.748]  Number 4.
[00:51:17.988 --> 00:51:20.350]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:20.751 --> 00:51:24.134]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:24.434 --> 00:51:24.975]  Number 5.
[00:51:25.235 --> 00:51:29.158]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:29.379 --> 00:51:34.143]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:34.423 --> 00:51:38.445]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:38.565 --> 00:51:40.165]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:40.365 --> 00:51:42.466]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:51:42.626 --> 00:51:44.967]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:52:09.445 --> 00:52:15.626]  We're going right to your calls, but Damon Vickers wanted to make one more point before we do it.
[00:52:15.646 --> 00:52:16.526]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:52:17.527 --> 00:52:29.009]  I just wanted to say, I mean, I am for people, and I'm for joy and happiness and love to be in greater abundance on this planet.
[00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:38.591]  And to do that, I think we have to elevate our consciousness to realize that we're all connected.
[00:52:39.275 --> 00:52:42.658]  And that we're all a part of the same family, the human family.
[00:52:43.539 --> 00:52:44.940]  And we have to respect one another.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:54.207]  And we can only, sometimes the only way that you can actually even get to that point is through some type of a crisis or an event that brings us together.
[00:52:55.188 --> 00:52:59.351]  But, Al Gore they're now saying is our global priest, president of the world.
[00:52:59.391 --> 00:53:00.612]  That's in the newspaper today.
[00:53:01.013 --> 00:53:02.294]  Let me tell you, my discernment...
[00:53:06.912 --> 00:53:15.981]  This guy that sold us on NAFTA and GATT now wants me to pay carbon tax that this apple breathes to him so I'll all be safe.
[00:53:16.021 --> 00:53:19.685]  I mean, I'm just saying, you know, this guy's the head of the New World Order.
[00:53:19.785 --> 00:53:20.485]  I ain't buying it.
[00:53:21.186 --> 00:53:22.327]  I doubt that's true.
[00:53:22.427 --> 00:53:23.889]  A giant demonic Nelly.
[00:53:25.675 --> 00:53:29.597]  I mean, come on man, this is not my cup of tea.
[00:53:29.617 --> 00:53:32.679]  Listen, let's go to Shanky in Georgia.
[00:53:32.719 --> 00:53:34.039]  Shanky, quick, go ahead.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.520]  Hey Alex, thanks.
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:40.883]  It's been a great conversation and I really enjoyed it because I'm right in the middle of both of you.
[00:53:41.023 --> 00:53:45.145]  I'm on Damon's side on a lot of things and yours on the other.
[00:53:45.865 --> 00:53:51.168]  To get to Damon and what he does for a living, out there right now there are a lot of top callers.
[00:53:51.208 --> 00:53:53.569]  He's done very good in the past at calling tops.
[00:53:55.143 --> 00:53:57.644]  We can all see the top coming now.
[00:53:57.845 --> 00:54:01.006]  You talk about riding the trends, and the trend is your friend.
[00:54:01.907 --> 00:54:10.972]  The crash of the dollar, I'm a big proponent of this, to wrestle this market away from the manipulators at this point in time.
[00:54:11.552 --> 00:54:16.495]  It's going to take some type of external event, and could it be the crash of the dollar?
[00:54:16.555 --> 00:54:18.256]  People are talking about wars, whatever.
[00:54:19.137 --> 00:54:20.958]  Can I get your opinions on that real quick?
[00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:26.214]  Yeah, I mean, the trend for the dollar is decidedly lower.
[00:54:26.614 --> 00:54:28.975]  Trend for gold oil, obviously decidedly higher.
[00:54:30.856 --> 00:54:32.296]  Do we need some type of an event?
[00:54:33.077 --> 00:54:40.860]  Yeah, I mean, ultimately, the war thing, I mean, ultimately, I think what you're saying is, ultimately, does the government
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:46.802]  Well, we've done that a couple of times in the past.
[00:54:47.182 --> 00:54:48.942]  I don't think they're really at that right now.
[00:54:49.002 --> 00:55:05.427]  I think their mindset is that a lower dollar juices exports, is good for the economy, and because they're not innovators, because Obama is not an entrepreneurial genius, he's a very well-spoken politician that delivers incredible speeches.
[00:55:06.247 --> 00:55:23.968]  So, I hope, I really, really, really, really profoundly hope that it doesn't take some type of a global war for us to revive the economy of us exporting military machinery over into a, you know, kind of an
[00:55:26.155 --> 00:55:31.216]  But the Rand Corporation is saying that's what they need, and that looks like where they're moving the next two years with Iran.
[00:55:31.356 --> 00:55:31.956]  I hope not.
[00:55:32.156 --> 00:55:33.016]  I really hope not.
[00:55:33.256 --> 00:55:35.177]  Damon, you bring up a key point here, though.
[00:55:35.557 --> 00:55:36.617]  The numbers are in.
[00:55:36.917 --> 00:55:40.698]  Manufacturing's down, even with a weaker dollar that should boost it.
[00:55:40.738 --> 00:55:43.238]  That doesn't bode well for the White House strategy.
[00:55:44.539 --> 00:55:45.519]  No, it doesn't work.
[00:55:45.619 --> 00:55:49.400]  I mean, destroying the dollar, I mean, inevitably doesn't work.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.700]  There's an endgame, and the endgame is that you don't have a currency at all.
[00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:55.461]  And then that replaces...
[00:55:59.071 --> 00:56:05.122]  And that gets replaced with SDRs or a basket of currencies or a new global cashless thumbprint system?
[00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:09.837]  Well, I don't know that we're moving towards a thumbprint system.
[00:56:09.877 --> 00:56:27.161]  I mean, I think that we're, that we, that if you see that the countries that have things like oil, like resources, Australia, South Africa, Canada, and I know there was, I misquoted it when I made that comment about Canada not having resources.
[00:56:27.201 --> 00:56:28.421]  Canada has a lot of resources.
[00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:30.682]  Their currencies are doing terrific.
[00:56:30.822 --> 00:56:33.062]  The United States, we don't have that stuff.
[00:56:33.262 --> 00:56:35.183]  We don't have anything to export.
[00:56:36.584 --> 00:56:39.568]  All right.
[00:56:40.469 --> 00:56:40.889]  Stay there.
[00:56:40.949 --> 00:56:43.852]  We got to move quick in the final segment with our guest.
[00:56:43.892 --> 00:56:48.558]  To Andrew, Karen, who says she disagrees, Jeff, Anita.
[00:56:48.578 --> 00:56:50.720]  We got to hurry, and I really appreciate our guest.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.823]  DamonVickers.com is Damon Vickers.
[00:56:53.303 --> 00:56:54.164]  On with us right now.
[00:56:54.224 --> 00:56:55.506]  This has really been intriguing.
[00:56:55.906 --> 00:56:56.367]  Stay with us.

[00:57:58.479 --> 00:58:05.948]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:58:06.228 --> 00:58:12.035]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:58:12.316 --> 00:58:14.939]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:58:15.259 --> 00:58:21.206]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.

[00:58:25.611 --> 00:58:30.998]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:58:31.238 --> 00:58:33.060]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.722]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:58:35.062 --> 00:58:37.325]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:58:37.605 --> 00:58:41.969]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:45.713]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:58:46.034 --> 00:58:48.656]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:49.157 --> 00:58:50.579]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:51.059 --> 00:58:53.181]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:59.443 --> 00:59:03.107]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:59:03.467 --> 00:59:06.471]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:59:06.711 --> 00:59:11.496]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:11.516 --> 00:59:17.763]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:17.923 --> 00:59:20.146]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:20.666 --> 00:59:20.966]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:20.986 --> 00:59:21.406]  Bernanke?
[00:59:21.486 --> 00:59:22.267]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:22.287 --> 00:59:23.427]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:23.447 --> 00:59:25.688]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:39.514 --> 00:59:39.954]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.149 --> 01:00:06.191]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.912 --> 01:00:08.013]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.674 --> 01:00:09.496]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.257 --> 01:00:11.158]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.178 --> 01:00:15.505]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.005 --> 01:00:20.051]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.632 --> 01:00:28.035]  We are taking your phone calls in this final segment with Damon Vickers.
[01:00:28.055 --> 01:00:29.016]  DamonVickers.com.
[01:00:29.036 --> 01:00:29.696]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.157 --> 01:00:33.980]  Our websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:39.324]  More calls and a huge news blitz of information I haven't covered yet coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:39.584 --> 01:00:40.685]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:00:40.705 --> 01:00:42.866]  Let's talk to Andrew in Missouri.
[01:00:43.226 --> 01:00:44.307]  You're on the air, Andrew.
[01:00:44.347 --> 01:00:44.808]  Go ahead.
[01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:49.391]  Yeah, I don't mean to, you know, derail the conversation because I'm loving it.
[01:00:50.137 --> 01:00:53.900]  But I just want to know what's up with silver, because I don't hear much about that.
[01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:56.902]  Well, silver's good, Greg.
[01:00:56.962 --> 01:00:58.303]  Glad to be called, Andrew.
[01:00:58.363 --> 01:00:59.064]  Silver's fine.
[01:01:00.045 --> 01:01:03.367]  It's not quite as strong as gold.
[01:01:03.608 --> 01:01:11.634]  When you're trading markets, you're investing in markets, you're always going to have the weaker sisters, meaning that there's the strong market and then there's the also-ran.
[01:01:12.214 --> 01:01:15.297]  My strongest advice to you, and remember this,
[01:01:16.016 --> 01:01:18.477]  Does that go for natural gas as being a weak second to oil?
[01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:45.659]  Natural gas has been in this deep dive in price for months and months and months and months.
[01:01:46.019 --> 01:01:49.662]  You would have thought, if energy is bottoming, why don't I buy natural gas?
[01:01:49.923 --> 01:01:50.563]  It's cheaper.
[01:01:51.184 --> 01:01:52.505]  It only got cheaper.
[01:01:52.685 --> 01:01:54.827]  Natural gas has been horrific year to date.
[01:01:55.807 --> 01:02:00.051]  And silver's not doing the same thing, but I'm just saying it's an ongoing process.
[01:02:01.724 --> 01:02:04.546]  So you're saying nothing succeeds like success.
[01:02:05.486 --> 01:02:07.568]  Why buy Yahoo when you can buy Google?
[01:02:07.848 --> 01:02:15.633]  The big one has a larger gravitational economic pull and is always going to accelerate mass at a faster clip.
[01:02:16.353 --> 01:02:21.076]  Yeah, Google, I mean, something may inevitably displace Google, but you don't see it on the horizon right now.
[01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:25.439]  But yeah, you want to stick with the best of breed and be willing to pay up for it.
[01:02:25.499 --> 01:02:26.720]  Don't buy the also ran.
[01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:32.762]  And on the contrary to that, if you're looking to make money from a market going down, sell the weakest.
[01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:34.242]  Sell the weakest market.
[01:02:34.722 --> 01:02:36.843]  Okay, does that answer your question, Andrew?
[01:02:37.483 --> 01:02:46.884]  Yeah, yeah, usually, you know, I've heard, I don't know if it's true, but I've heard silver was 15 to 1, you know, 15 ounces of silver by 1 ounce of gold in the past.
[01:02:47.985 --> 01:02:54.026]  Yeah, it may be, but you sound like a person that's long silver that's seeking to justify their position.
[01:02:54.166 --> 01:02:55.426]  How much silver do you own, Andrew?
[01:02:56.867 --> 01:02:58.648]  I'm just, you know, I'm just getting into it.
[01:02:58.688 --> 01:03:01.090]  I've heard, you know, that's the next best thing is silver.
[01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:02.071]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:02.571]  It is.
[01:03:02.591 --> 01:03:13.338]  Alex brought up the natural gas thing, and, okay, you're going to buy energy, you believe that energy is going to benefit from the dollar, and you buy natural gas, I mean, and it just goes down on you.
[01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:25.306]  So, if you're looking to make money from a decline in the dollar, and a rise in metals and more tangible, real stuff, my suggestion would be to own the gold, and to be prepared to buy it on weakness.
[01:03:26.983 --> 01:03:29.184]  Well, Damon, I believe in diversification.
[01:03:29.224 --> 01:03:35.747]  So I think, I've always told people, 70% gold, 30% silver, that's just my layman's view on it.
[01:03:35.947 --> 01:03:45.111]  And also, silver for the poor man, somebody who doesn't have a lot of money, that's good to get into because some people think it's not going to be as volatile.
[01:03:45.191 --> 01:03:46.171]  I mean, who knows?
[01:03:46.211 --> 01:03:47.232]  But I think diversification.
[01:03:47.252 --> 01:03:49.993]  But obviously, you're more of an expert than I am on that.
[01:03:50.033 --> 01:03:51.694]  Let's talk to Karen in Oregon.
[01:03:52.014 --> 01:03:53.655]  Karen, you're on the air with Damon Vickers.
[01:03:53.675 --> 01:03:53.995]  Go ahead.
[01:03:55.185 --> 01:03:56.126]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:03:56.186 --> 01:04:10.535]  I think maybe his grandmother didn't marry Rockefeller because she heard about the John Rockefeller that went in and hired thugs to murder people in Ludlow, the miners, who were actually opposed to the horrific conditions they had.
[01:04:10.995 --> 01:04:20.642]  Not to mention the Rockefellers donated to the United Nations, the eugenics that you talked about, and if you want to talk about natural gas, I think Demon right there is certainly full of it.
[01:04:21.477 --> 01:04:22.278]  Nice, nice.
[01:04:22.318 --> 01:04:22.758]  I like that.
[01:04:23.178 --> 01:04:25.040]  Well, my name isn't Demon, it's Damon.
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:36.968]  And as for the bearish swipes at the Rockefeller family, I'm glad that I can go to Acadia National Park because of the Rockefellers.
[01:04:37.028 --> 01:04:40.510]  I'm glad that the U.S.
[01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:42.091]  Virgin Islands Park exists.
[01:04:42.471 --> 01:04:44.433]  I'm glad that the Teton Parks exist.
[01:04:44.853 --> 01:04:48.976]  And I think they've made many, many good contributions to the planet.
[01:04:50.031 --> 01:04:51.412]  Well, Damon, I mean, let me say this.
[01:04:51.752 --> 01:04:55.834]  I know there's a lot of fear out there, and all the stuff that you said, I'm against.
[01:04:56.334 --> 01:04:57.695]  Yeah, I mean, certainly.
[01:04:57.715 --> 01:04:59.515]  I mean, let me just say this.
[01:05:00.416 --> 01:05:05.138]  The Rockefellers are a diverse family, but the big prime movers are really bad news.
[01:05:05.178 --> 01:05:09.500]  I mean, I've seen editorials by David Rockefeller praising Mao Tse-Tung in the New York Times.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.361]  We have that in my film, Endgame.
[01:05:11.621 --> 01:05:16.824]  But I don't think we need to set Damon up here as David Rockefeller.
[01:05:16.884 --> 01:05:17.424]  He was simply...
[01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:36.158]  Yes, we're not interviewing, though I heard a phone conversation at Bilderberg that was recorded, but the guy in the hotel wouldn't let me use it, where he called up David Rockefeller at Bilderberg, 2008, and had a long conversation with him in the morning, and it was David Rockefeller.
[01:05:36.178 --> 01:05:43.223]  They called his room at 6 a.m., and it was like talking to Mr. Burns from The Simpsons.
[01:05:45.465 --> 01:05:48.947]  You know, the problem is, as you get rid of David Rockefeller, it's like shark teeth.
[01:05:49.288 --> 01:05:52.089]  There are other people out there pushing this same system.
[01:05:52.169 --> 01:05:52.610]  Exactly.
[01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:59.214]  And the man is quite advanced in age anyway, so you may be hearing his passing on literally any day now.
[01:05:59.254 --> 01:06:05.798]  But I was going to add, Hitler set up national parks and loved animals, so just because, you know...
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.742]  Yes, and a broken clock is right twice a day.
[01:06:10.762 --> 01:06:12.663]  A blind hog can occasionally find troubles.
[01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:23.931]  I mean, you know, to sit there and say, well, no, I mean, to sit there and say that the Rockefellers occasionally do something good, I mean, it's, you know what, though?
[01:06:23.971 --> 01:06:27.153]  You've got the courage to come on here and you're telling the truth on television.
[01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:29.775]  We just appreciate Damon Vickers for coming on this show.
[01:06:29.795 --> 01:06:30.856]  Let's take a few more calls.
[01:06:31.216 --> 01:06:33.918]  Let's talk to, did you have anything else to add, Karen?
[01:06:35.242 --> 01:06:35.945]  Okay, she's gone.
[01:06:36.307 --> 01:06:37.913]  Let's go to Anita in Texas.
[01:06:37.973 --> 01:06:40.524]  Anita, you're on the air with Mr. Vickers.
[01:06:41.775 --> 01:06:47.639]  Yeah, I just wanted to... Actually, the lady before me took pretty much the words right out of my mouth.
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:07:03.671]  I was going to say the same thing you said just now to Alex, that, you know, they do a few good things probably for their own benefit and have done, but that doesn't make up for the things they have done bad and are doing and are planning to do.
[01:07:04.171 --> 01:07:10.376]  And if they were really for the environment, health and environment and everything like that, then they wouldn't be...
[01:07:11.335 --> 01:07:11.735]  I don't know.
[01:07:28.303 --> 01:07:30.825]  Every one of us, Anita, has a number of servants.
[01:07:30.865 --> 01:07:35.207]  They're just located in a different country, like Bangladesh, Vietnam, or India.
[01:07:35.267 --> 01:07:36.108]  I mean, what's that number?
[01:07:36.148 --> 01:07:37.448]  Maybe 20, 30 to 1?
[01:07:37.769 --> 01:07:42.972]  How many people over in the third world, Anita, do you imagine it takes to support our lifestyle here?
[01:07:43.372 --> 01:07:52.697]  How many dupes around the world, how many countries around the world do we have to basically plunge into economic chaos to support our standard of living?
[01:07:52.737 --> 01:07:53.798]  Well, Anita, let me say this.
[01:07:58.334 --> 01:07:59.575]  I mean, it's homegrown.
[01:08:19.019 --> 01:08:20.299]  Great question.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:37.505]  Well, we're coming up, as we speak today, the markets have actually been really strong, and it looks like we're breaking the downtrend of the 2007 peak, meaning that we've hit this line a number of times, and the markets may break that downtrend.
[01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:45.327]  If they do, a lot of the people that have shorted the market in recent weeks, thinking the market was overbought, will be forced to cover, and then we go higher.
[01:08:45.367 --> 01:08:46.788]  Your question, how high will it go?
[01:08:47.568 --> 01:08:51.932]  In theory, we could go all the way back up to the highs of 2007.
[01:08:52.752 --> 01:08:54.434]  I know that'd make people feel a lot better.
[01:08:54.614 --> 01:08:56.395]  And of course, they'll go out and spend some money.
[01:08:57.796 --> 01:09:05.722]  However, it's an illusion, because while that's happening, the dollar is probably going lower, so they may actually be making nothing.
[01:09:06.022 --> 01:09:08.945]  So it's like endorphins flooding the brain as you're dying.
[01:09:09.265 --> 01:09:10.326]  It's a sucker's rally.
[01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:22.125]  Until we meaningfully break out, and what I mean by meaningfully break out, I mean this market not only goes up, but it takes out the 2007 highs.
[01:09:23.466 --> 01:09:25.929]  This is all kind of interesting.
[01:09:26.489 --> 01:09:36.678]  An interesting game to watch, and the only way that can happen is the arrival of a social trend, an adoption cycle, and an investment cycle, a total bull market, whereby we start
[01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:39.977]  Is there any down in gold?
[01:09:39.997 --> 01:09:42.599]  I mean, do you see any way it's going to plunge?
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.904]  Well, I don't know that it's going to plunge, but there certainly could be days.
[01:09:48.144 --> 01:09:50.606]  There could even be weeks where gold does go down.
[01:09:51.887 --> 01:10:03.357]  I would, from a trading standpoint, I would be watching that $1,000 level as kind of our risk management point, is that if gold breaks below $1,000 significantly,
[01:10:05.219 --> 01:10:08.500]  But on the long graph, you believe it's only going up for the foreseeable future?
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:11.981]  I think the trends on gold are very, very strong.
[01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:18.123]  I think we'll see $1,350, $1,400, and we may even see places well beyond that.
[01:10:18.463 --> 01:10:20.564]  Real quick call from Kyle in Pennsylvania.
[01:10:20.604 --> 01:10:22.465]  Kyle, you're on the air with Damon Vickers.
[01:10:23.205 --> 01:10:24.125]  Yeah, I got a question.
[01:10:24.625 --> 01:10:26.566]  Like today, for example, we see that
[01:10:27.208 --> 01:10:28.569]  Yeah, that's what he's saying.
[01:10:28.589 --> 01:10:28.909]  Go ahead.
[01:10:47.136 --> 01:10:47.296]  Yeah.
[01:10:47.316 --> 01:10:47.456]  Yeah.
[01:11:08.458 --> 01:11:08.558]  Okay.
[01:11:19.059 --> 01:11:19.920]  We got to cut it there.
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:20.921]  We got to cut it there.
[01:11:20.961 --> 01:11:21.582]  Thank you, Kyle.
[01:11:21.722 --> 01:11:22.803]  I'll take more calls coming up.
[01:11:23.223 --> 01:11:25.386]  I'll tell you, you gave us an hour and 15 minutes.
[01:11:25.446 --> 01:11:26.527]  We are very thankful.

[01:11:30.952 --> 01:11:40.301]  This was an amazing interview, and I really look forward to having you back up with us in the future to give us a different perspective, and it's been very informative.
[01:11:40.321 --> 01:11:40.622]  Thank you.
[01:11:42.961 --> 01:11:44.383]  Let me say bye to you here at the break.
[01:11:44.463 --> 01:11:45.806]  Thank you so much for that interview.
[01:11:46.306 --> 01:11:49.151]  That'll definitely make the rounds of the internet for some time to come.
[01:11:49.852 --> 01:11:54.099]  We even got a little talk of the Queen of England and her servants in there, which I always like to do.
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:55.601]  We'll be right back.
[01:11:55.621 --> 01:11:56.903]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.

[01:13:00.183 --> 01:13:03.851]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:04.211 --> 01:13:07.217]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:07.458 --> 01:13:08.881]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:13:09.577 --> 01:13:12.238]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:12.258 --> 01:13:18.480]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:23.662]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:23.842 --> 01:13:33.825]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:33.925 --> 01:13:36.047]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:37.589]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:37.869 --> 01:13:40.151]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:40.331 --> 01:13:42.193]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:42.453 --> 01:13:47.218]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:13:58.686 --> 01:14:02.908]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:14:03.228 --> 01:14:07.289]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:14:07.569 --> 01:14:12.971]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:14:13.312 --> 01:14:13.732]  It's true.
[01:14:14.292 --> 01:14:14.512]  We're good.
[01:14:34.482 --> 01:14:39.186]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:14:39.426 --> 01:14:44.189]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:10.530]  Watch me!
[01:15:11.691 --> 01:15:12.411]  Watch me!
[01:15:13.691 --> 01:15:14.231]  I got it!
[01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:16.252]  Watch me!
[01:15:17.512 --> 01:15:18.012]  I got it!
[01:15:18.853 --> 01:15:19.353]  Hey!
[01:15:20.393 --> 01:15:22.874]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[01:15:23.934 --> 01:15:26.915]  I got something that tells me what it's all about!
[01:15:27.255 --> 01:15:29.696]  I got soul!
[01:15:29.856 --> 01:15:31.377]  And I'm super bad!
[01:15:32.997 --> 01:15:35.458]  I got soul!
[01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:39.019]  And I'm super bad!
[01:15:42.287 --> 01:15:43.508]  Damon Vickers.
[01:16:12.699 --> 01:16:13.380]  Interesting interview.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:17.805]  You know, I don't think he's an evil person or a bad guy and he is a regular listener and I quiz him during breaks.
[01:16:20.748 --> 01:16:32.360]  But that's why Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, came on this show and during the breaks tried to convince me about globalism and the new world order and that it was a foregone conclusion so I might as well have my voice heard in all of it.
[01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:42.435]  And that's the thing, you can talk to these guys, and they'll admit it's all going on, and then the rest of the mainstream media says it doesn't exist, so we can't even have a real debate about it.
[01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:50.421]  And that's because there's a lot of different people that... He doesn't even really believe in globalization, he's saying it's happening, so what are we gonna do?
[01:16:51.702 --> 01:16:54.284]  But that's almost a mind trick of capitulation to it.
[01:16:54.564 --> 01:16:56.846]  But I appreciate him giving us an hour and 20 minutes, and...
[01:16:59.693 --> 01:17:06.514]  I'm excited to know we can have him and others back on the show so you can get the speech I've gotten many times from people of his similar ilk.
[01:17:07.074 --> 01:17:27.598]  Now, a little bit more extreme globalist, Aaron Russo, in his final interview, final videotape interview I did with him that we made into a film, Reflections and Warnings, he talks about Nick Rockefeller, going, look, everybody's going to have microchips, and our chips, the elite's chips, are going to say, kiss my butt.
[01:17:30.151 --> 01:17:35.753]  He told him this a decade ago, and how they're going to reduce the world population as soon as their world government's in place.
[01:17:35.813 --> 01:17:42.416]  Well, I have government policy textbooks by the White House science czar, like eco-science, saying the same thing.
[01:17:43.337 --> 01:17:45.638]  And they really believe this is for everyone's own good.
[01:17:45.738 --> 01:17:48.939]  But what it turns into is total corruption and a nightmare.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:57.743]  If you go back and
[01:17:58.729 --> 01:18:01.670]  Look at all the things the New World Order crowd have engineered and carried out.
[01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:02.170]  It's horrible.
[01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:26.576]  And if you look at California, that series of articles that were in all their major newspapers in the last couple years, where over a million police and state employees and others are above the law, their license plates cannot be read by the license plate reading software that all of our license plates get read by.
[01:18:27.316 --> 01:18:28.196]  They're exempt.
[01:18:29.403 --> 01:18:30.143]  From the law.
[01:18:30.704 --> 01:18:31.764]  Just like illegal aliens.
[01:18:31.804 --> 01:18:35.665]  The globalists want illegal aliens here to drive down wages, to globalize the U.S.
[01:18:35.725 --> 01:18:38.527]  I'm not against the illegal aliens, but I know they're being used as a tool.
[01:18:39.107 --> 01:18:40.087]  I'm not against water.
[01:18:40.247 --> 01:18:40.908]  I love water.
[01:18:40.988 --> 01:18:41.768]  I like swimming in it.
[01:18:42.508 --> 01:18:45.969]  But, I don't want somebody to cram a fire hose down my throat and blow my guts out.
[01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:52.372]  I don't want to have my arms bound and a bowling ball tied to me and be thrown into the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:18:53.953 --> 01:18:57.134]  So see, I don't dislike the illegal aliens, but they are
[01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:05.313]  A bottomless pit of third world labor that will drive down the wages and destroy their future and my future and my family's future.
[01:19:07.975 --> 01:19:17.818]  So I'm forced to speak out against them and I can't sit here and make the decision for third world populations that are having 5, 6, 7 kids.
[01:19:17.918 --> 01:19:18.779]  Most of them aren't having 20.
[01:19:19.499 --> 01:19:20.799]  The average of the third world is about 4.
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.421]  On average they have about 6 kids but 2 of them die.
[01:19:26.516 --> 01:19:27.738]  These things will balance out.
[01:19:27.798 --> 01:19:29.120]  There's been major studies put out.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.742]  The Earth can take 10 billion people.
[01:19:31.423 --> 01:19:35.388]  The world population is trending to start dropping at 8 billion in 2020.
[01:19:39.827 --> 01:19:50.310]  Certainly, we have a lot of dirty technologies that are hurting the earth, but you cannot allow this elite group to covertly spike your vaccines, spike your water, and do this.
[01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:55.731]  But then the elite's argument is always, well, Alex, aren't the people guilty of this?
[01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:58.852]  The information you have is public, but they don't care.
[01:20:01.835 --> 01:20:03.056]  And there is an argument there.
[01:20:03.076 --> 01:20:06.821]  You know, he said, well, somebody who gets conned, they were part of the con.
[01:20:06.861 --> 01:20:11.646]  People that took these loans on houses they couldn't pay back, aren't they part of the fraud too?
[01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:13.628]  And my analogy is, yeah.
[01:20:13.768 --> 01:20:22.658]  A 7 or 8 year old kid who disregards their parents' warning and goes out in the front yard and talks to the man in the van that has the puppy dog.
[01:20:24.594 --> 01:20:27.115]  Or the little kid that's with them they use to lure the other kid.
[01:20:27.776 --> 01:20:35.360]  Yes, that 5, 6, 7, 8 year old, 9 year old, they are guilty of not listening to their parents and they should get in trouble.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:43.304]  Do they deserve to be hogtied and raped for 6 weeks and then have a snuff film made of their head being macheted off?
[01:20:43.444 --> 01:20:43.664]  No.
[01:20:45.245 --> 01:20:47.786]  They don't deserve to be raped and have their head macheted off.
[01:20:48.907 --> 01:20:49.447]  With a machete.
[01:20:51.713 --> 01:21:01.858]  And once you buy into, oh, we've got to stop human suffering with a global government, it will fix it, you have fallen to the New World Order.
[01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:06.261]  And that's why this film, Reflections and Warnings, is so important.
[01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:09.122]  People that see it are like, man, this is really informative.
[01:21:09.763 --> 01:21:13.425]  Because I'm in it, separate little clips, video clips, documentation.
[01:21:14.165 --> 01:21:17.567]  And then you see the stuff Aaron Russo said two and a half years ago before he died.
[01:21:18.823 --> 01:21:20.444]  He was getting cancer treatment in Houston.
[01:21:20.864 --> 01:21:22.005]  So much of it has come true.

[01:21:37.415 --> 01:21:38.236]  It needs to be seen.

[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:44.840]  Give them to people.
[01:21:49.153 --> 01:21:52.119]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:52.139 --> 01:21:55.765]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.424 --> 01:22:07.546]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:22:07.586 --> 01:22:10.707]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:22:10.947 --> 01:22:16.648]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:21.309]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:22:21.589 --> 01:22:23.930]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:33.301]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:22:33.421 --> 01:22:38.827]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[01:22:38.967 --> 01:22:40.829]  Help others and earn extra income.

[01:22:59.022 --> 01:23:01.625]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:23:02.045 --> 01:23:07.011]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:07.371 --> 01:23:09.113]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:09.414 --> 01:23:14.019]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:14.039 --> 01:23:14.499]  We're good.
[01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:38.393]  How much will you need?
[01:23:38.633 --> 01:23:39.234]  We don't know.
[01:23:39.534 --> 01:23:40.435]  How much do you want?
[01:23:40.636 --> 01:23:41.377]  All you can get.
[01:23:41.577 --> 01:23:42.418]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:23:42.678 --> 01:23:45.441]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:47.904]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:23:47.924 --> 01:23:48.925]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:23:57.995 --> 01:24:04.863]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:24:04.983 --> 01:24:06.225]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:24:06.265 --> 01:24:06.925]  It's very real.
[01:24:07.085 --> 01:24:09.208]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:24:09.328 --> 01:24:10.830]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:15.295]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:24:15.435 --> 01:24:17.797]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:24:28.807 --> 01:24:31.549]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:24:31.649 --> 01:24:34.271]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:24:34.372 --> 01:24:41.538]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:24:45.543 --> 01:24:45.783]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:24:45.803 --> 01:24:47.726]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:25:30.947 --> 01:25:33.509]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:25:33.529 --> 01:25:34.269]  to 3 p.m.
[01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:35.149]  Central.
[01:25:37.771 --> 01:25:40.332]  We are here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:42.993 --> 01:25:47.055]  And if you think I'm gonna sit around as the globalists take control of my life,
[01:25:49.824 --> 01:25:51.365]  You got another thing coming!
[01:25:54.606 --> 01:25:56.927]  I understand human potential and our destiny.
[01:25:57.348 --> 01:26:06.412]  Even if the world was overpopulated, the elite should stop suppressing technologies and hoarding them, and we should be exporting excess populations to the stars!
[01:26:08.473 --> 01:26:18.938]  The elite have made the decision to exterminate most of the world's population, all because they don't want you to have access to the life extension technologies.
[01:26:21.491 --> 01:26:23.792]  I don't like them charting the future of the world.
[01:26:24.152 --> 01:26:29.355]  And I don't like their responses back to us of, well, the public doesn't care.
[01:26:29.675 --> 01:26:32.317]  They want to play video games and watch UT Longhorns.
[01:26:33.077 --> 01:26:37.400]  Because the establishment has force fed it down their throats in a feedback loop.
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:49.066]  Now I said earlier, I was going to play the Head of Health and Human Services clip where
[01:26:52.264 --> 01:27:02.813]  Kathleen Sebelius is bragging publicly about our PR campaign and children's television shows and movies to take the swine flu shot is really working.
[01:27:04.014 --> 01:27:05.755]  That is only the tip of the iceberg.
[01:27:06.616 --> 01:27:19.767]  Last week we played clips from Fox News where they brag, Fox TV itself, that they are propagandizing in every TV show, in every movie, in every program for the global carbon tax.
[01:27:20.714 --> 01:27:29.982]  And then you have the White House, going back many White Houses, but it's getting bigger and bigger now, and you have the General Accounting Office stating it's illegal, taking hundreds of billions.
[01:27:30.722 --> 01:27:31.583]  Hundreds of billions.
[01:27:31.623 --> 01:27:45.235]  I mean, Bush spent $8 billion just on the no-child-left-behind propaganda, and didn't tell you that sitcoms and dramas and radio and newsprint, fiction, nonfiction, was lying and spinning and paid for.
[01:27:46.903 --> 01:27:49.985]  Most TV is now paid for lying propaganda.
[01:27:50.105 --> 01:27:54.449]  I don't know how Jesse Ventura's TV show is going to get on the air if it's actually anti-New World Order.
[01:27:54.509 --> 01:27:55.830]  He swears it is.
[01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:56.710]  I've looked at some of it.
[01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:57.591]  It looks pretty good.
[01:27:58.452 --> 01:27:59.592]  We'll see if that even happens.
[01:27:59.612 --> 01:28:02.615]  That was him hint-hinting last week that it may not even make it on the air.
[01:28:03.817 --> 01:28:07.399]  Fox admits to planting political brainwashing in popular TV shows.
[01:28:07.419 --> 01:28:09.401]  Perhaps we should cue this up, too.
[01:28:09.901 --> 01:28:10.602]  See, here's the problem.
[01:28:10.642 --> 01:28:14.924]  I don't want to just play a couple clips here and then make you think I'm putting on all my evidence.
[01:28:15.025 --> 01:28:19.347]  I have hundreds of clips, not just where they're admitting it, but where they're engaging in it.
[01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:25.351]  Suddenly, Al Gore is on half the dramas and TV shows, and Saturday Night Live is the priest, the savior.
[01:28:25.692 --> 01:28:32.997]  If you don't go for the global carbon tax, you want to kill Africans, when it's the globalists that are actually implanting the vaccines with the HIV.
[01:28:34.315 --> 01:28:37.440]  And their argument is, well, if we don't kill them, there'll be even more suffering.
[01:28:38.361 --> 01:28:45.893]  Then it comes out in the Times of London, the world's rich secretly meet to discuss population reduction.
[01:28:47.751 --> 01:29:00.622]  And it is disgusting how the general public hears this and has an automatic denial program implanted in their mind to just say, none of it exists, none of it exists, when I'm here telling you the secrets of the world.
[01:29:01.143 --> 01:29:04.466]  I'm here telling you what's really going on in the controllers' minds.
[01:29:04.526 --> 01:29:05.607]  I'm reading their documents.
[01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:06.808]  I spend the time.
[01:29:07.128 --> 01:29:12.512]  I'm here telling you that a horrible nightmare is being set up by a bunch of true believers.
[01:29:15.115 --> 01:29:15.235]  And
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:22.364]  Their argument is almost proven by the fact that you want to be killed.
[01:29:22.404 --> 01:29:24.265]  You want to drink sodium fluoride.
[01:29:26.186 --> 01:29:29.969]  Hundreds of chemicals they put in your water to give you cancer and sterilize your butts.
[01:29:30.529 --> 01:29:36.213]  And do you see people marching on the City Hall of Austin, Texas, where I have probably 100,000 plus fans and listeners?
[01:29:36.233 --> 01:29:36.293]  No!
[01:29:39.514 --> 01:29:44.636]  I would have to beat the drum for a month to get 10,000 people to go down there and have them ignore us.
[01:29:45.016 --> 01:29:46.296]  It needs to be every day.
[01:29:46.336 --> 01:29:47.556]  It needs to be 100,000 of you.
[01:29:47.636 --> 01:29:52.518]  And it's the same for other places around the country.
[01:29:52.558 --> 01:29:57.039]  We have got to prove to the elite that we are part of the decision-making process.
[01:29:57.339 --> 01:30:04.001]  Because in their weird psychology, they say, hey, we've told you what we're doing, you don't care, therefore it's fair game.
[01:30:05.742 --> 01:30:06.742]  There's another issue, too.
[01:30:09.423 --> 01:30:12.525]  Globalists are always saying, join us, join us, join us.
[01:30:13.925 --> 01:30:17.667]  If I've been approached 50 times, I bet Ron Paul's been approached 500 times.
[01:30:19.608 --> 01:30:22.690]  I've been taken up on the mountain many times and offered great power.
[01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:25.751]  But it means nothing because I know it's evil at its core.
[01:30:26.151 --> 01:30:27.172]  I'm not delusional.
[01:30:27.492 --> 01:30:28.593]  I know it stinks.
[01:30:30.173 --> 01:30:35.116]  My scam meter goes off the chart just looking at Al Gore, much less understanding him and researching him.
[01:30:35.576 --> 01:30:37.277]  That just verifies what I already knew.
[01:30:42.998 --> 01:30:46.482]  But they have this weird rule where they've got to tell you what they're going to do to you.
[01:30:47.202 --> 01:30:48.283]  It's like fair game.
[01:30:48.323 --> 01:30:50.125]  It's like they're saying, prepare for battle.
[01:30:50.926 --> 01:30:58.333]  It's like you're in a ring with a shield and a sword, and they hit their sword and shield together and say, on guard!
[01:30:58.894 --> 01:30:59.394]  On guard!
[01:30:59.495 --> 01:31:00.295]  Get on guard!
[01:31:00.456 --> 01:31:01.436]  I'm going to kill you!
[01:31:02.981 --> 01:31:04.062]  I mean, they're gentlemen.
[01:31:04.102 --> 01:31:06.044]  They say, on guard, I'm going to kill you.
[01:31:06.624 --> 01:31:10.227]  On guard, I'm going to build a technological police state grid, and then we're going to kill you.
[01:31:10.827 --> 01:31:14.570]  Do you see all our police massing around you, brainwashed and ready for blood?
[01:31:14.771 --> 01:31:15.952]  Do you see all the surveillance?
[01:31:16.112 --> 01:31:17.813]  Do you see how we're imploding your economy?
[01:31:18.253 --> 01:31:18.874]  On guard!
[01:31:19.534 --> 01:31:19.995]  On guard!
[01:31:20.035 --> 01:31:22.957]  And the public's like, cheeseburger, I like it.
[01:31:23.257 --> 01:31:25.760]  You know, just like, that Alex Jones is a nut!
[01:31:26.738 --> 01:31:28.279]  And I'm going, they're staying on guard!
[01:31:28.299 --> 01:31:29.240]  They're staying on guard!
[01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:29.920]  They're attacking!
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:30.681]  They're attacking!
[01:31:30.701 --> 01:31:36.705]  My God, they just gave 45% of the women in this country, in one African country, HIV!
[01:31:36.745 --> 01:31:38.586]  My God, these people are devastators!
[01:31:39.267 --> 01:31:41.788]  And the general public's like, did you hear about the UT horns?
[01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:43.930]  Did you hear about the Winter Olympics coming up?
[01:31:44.170 --> 01:31:45.890]  And I'm like, yeah, that's real neat.
[01:31:46.211 --> 01:31:47.671]  I understand the UT horns.
[01:31:48.031 --> 01:31:54.393]  You should drop everything you're doing to fight these people, to speak out against them, to at least address them.
[01:31:54.673 --> 01:32:00.674]  If you can't even address them with real evidence, then they say that's proof that you're subhuman and deserve to die.
[01:32:01.974 --> 01:32:08.016]  If you can't even man up and face the situation we're in and address the elite, they won't even talk to you.
[01:32:09.582 --> 01:32:11.725]  They think it's cute and funny I'm on the air.
[01:32:11.965 --> 01:32:14.028]  They think it's cute and funny I'm here warning you.
[01:32:14.368 --> 01:32:17.292]  Because they think you're dogs and that you're not going to wake up.
[01:32:18.654 --> 01:32:23.360]  And they say if you did wake up and actually addressed them, then they might do something else.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.521]  But I know their nature.
[01:32:24.541 --> 01:32:25.442]  That's not really the case.
[01:32:25.503 --> 01:32:26.324]  It's like a little game.
[01:32:28.493 --> 01:32:31.954]  All right, let's play some of these clips and go to some final calls here for people that are holding a mic.
[01:32:32.274 --> 01:32:33.814]  Elizabeth, John, Lamont, and Jason.
[01:32:34.075 --> 01:32:35.495]  But I'm gonna go to your calls, you gotta go quickly.
[01:32:35.715 --> 01:32:41.056]  The first clip is the Health and Human Services Secretary bragging about how great the propaganda's going.
[01:32:42.377 --> 01:32:48.478]  And the White House now admits they're propagandizing on global warming, on anti-gun, this is all going on right now.
[01:32:48.939 --> 01:32:56.141]  You need to be aware, this isn't a free or healthy society when your tax money's used to take over TV, radio, and media.
[01:32:57.141 --> 01:32:57.501]  Here it is.
[01:33:02.529 --> 01:33:03.210]  In just a moment.
[01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.471]  Here it is.
[01:33:04.491 --> 01:33:05.252]  It's loading now.
[01:33:06.533 --> 01:33:09.415]  For the latest news on H1N1, go to vactruth.com.
[01:33:09.516 --> 01:33:13.840]  That's who posted this.
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:27.853]  I am pleased to have a chance to appear with my colleagues and give you an update at this critical time and I would start by echoing what Secretary Napolitano has said that
[01:33:28.553 --> 01:33:28.653]  Yes.
[01:33:44.026 --> 01:33:48.688]  Results also with state and local partners, tribal partners, private sector.
[01:33:48.728 --> 01:33:52.229]  Finally, Mr. Chair, we are continuing to focus on mitigation.
[01:33:53.269 --> 01:33:56.951]  In the meantime, there's still some fairly simple steps that people need to take.
[01:33:57.491 --> 01:34:05.794]  Social isolation, staying home when you're sick, washing hands, coughing and sneezing into arms.
[01:34:05.854 --> 01:34:11.296]  I've been very impressed that children are listening to Elmo and they are correcting their parents in terms of
[01:34:12.876 --> 01:34:13.897]  Sneeze technique.
[01:34:14.697 --> 01:34:21.719]  And we are doing everything we can think of with our partners in terms of the communication effort.
[01:34:22.599 --> 01:34:33.582]  Not only using traditional media, but we have great partners in Sesame Street, in Sid the Science Kid, where the Secretary and I will launch a new program today.
[01:34:34.202 --> 01:34:38.223]  Facebook, Twitter, ESPN that runs the
[01:34:39.083 --> 01:34:47.186]  Scores scrolls into college dorms is a partner in encouraging that age group to get the vaccination.
[01:34:47.286 --> 01:34:49.547]  We've had YouTube videos.
[01:34:49.967 --> 01:34:56.469]  So we are trying to get the word out to folks that vaccination is the best defense against this flu.
[01:34:56.529 --> 01:35:02.251]  And the good news is, I think it's beginning to become available around the country.
[01:35:05.211 --> 01:35:12.233]  Okay, now that was Kathleen Sebelius, who I guess had a stye, so she was like one-eyed like Sauron.
[01:35:13.334 --> 01:35:14.674]  They're staring out at people.
[01:35:14.794 --> 01:35:15.674]  Did you catch it?
[01:35:16.695 --> 01:35:23.277]  Not only are they admitting they're brainwashing your children, we're going to play one of those clips right now from PBS, paid for by the government.
[01:35:24.737 --> 01:35:27.938]  Did you notice she said the young children are correcting their parents?
[01:35:27.958 --> 01:35:29.499]  Remember Al Gore and all these
[01:35:30.549 --> 01:35:32.871]  Middle school, high school, and elementary school speeches.
[01:35:32.911 --> 01:35:34.632]  He says, correct your parents.
[01:35:34.772 --> 01:35:35.572]  They're wrong.
[01:35:36.813 --> 01:35:42.837]  And then the New York Times had those articles where the seven-year-old writes fake tickets to their parents.
[01:35:43.357 --> 01:35:48.921]  And now at schools in the U.S., U.K., and Canada, they give them little ticket books to write their parents up.
[01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:52.723]  This is how they're inducting us into the 1984 society.
[01:35:53.003 --> 01:35:56.506]  The state is taking over your children right in front of you.
[01:35:56.526 --> 01:35:59.688]  That is absolute, total tyranny you just saw.
[01:36:01.633 --> 01:36:03.453]  That should enrage all of you.
[01:36:04.394 --> 01:36:06.994]  You should have all your children out of public schools immediately.
[01:36:07.254 --> 01:36:09.014]  You shouldn't be letting them watch television.
[01:36:09.354 --> 01:36:15.616]  The state is taking over the family and telling your children to tell you what to do!
[01:36:15.896 --> 01:36:20.857]  It doesn't get more Nazi or Soviet or Maoist or Hitlerian than that!
[01:36:21.737 --> 01:36:24.997]  Now, here's one of the brainwashing programs she mentioned.
[01:36:25.377 --> 01:36:28.058]  And notice that the nurse laughs when she goes,
[01:36:29.338 --> 01:36:31.341]  It'll hurt a little, but it'll help a lot.
[01:36:32.663 --> 01:36:33.625]  They're even letting you know.
[01:36:33.645 --> 01:36:35.428]  The sterilization.
[01:36:35.969 --> 01:36:37.171]  Because there's too many of you.
[01:36:37.191 --> 01:36:40.416]  It may hurt a little, but it'll help a lot.
[01:36:40.496 --> 01:36:40.957]  Here it is.
[01:36:42.268 --> 01:36:42.488]  Ooh!
[01:36:42.708 --> 01:36:45.209]  Stopping that virus, that's our goal!
[01:36:45.249 --> 01:36:47.890]  So come on everybody, we're getting the shot!
[01:36:47.970 --> 01:36:52.992]  It might hurt a little bit, just a little bit, but it's gonna help a whole lot!
[01:36:53.993 --> 01:37:04.957]  It's vaccination is a great opportunity, yes it is, yes it is, to do something for yourself and your community, yes it is, yes it is!
[01:37:05.017 --> 01:37:10.479]  The virus won't spread if we don't let it, so roll up your sleeves and come and get it!
[01:37:13.646 --> 01:37:15.787]  If I don't get the virus, I won't give it to you!
[01:37:15.907 --> 01:37:18.489]  If you don't give it to me, I won't give it to her!
[01:37:18.689 --> 01:37:21.450]  If I don't get it from her, I won't give it to them!
[01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:22.431]  That's true!
[01:37:23.271 --> 01:37:25.392]  If I don't get the virus, I won't give it to you!
[01:37:25.412 --> 01:37:27.634]  And I won't be able to have children either!
[01:37:27.714 --> 01:37:30.535]  Children dying of cancer, so much fun!
[01:37:30.555 --> 01:37:34.197]  Take the euthanization shot, slow kill, yeah!
[01:37:36.799 --> 01:37:39.180]  Soft kill weapons, ha ha ha!
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.501]  Help a whole lot!
[01:37:47.908 --> 01:37:48.708]  Let's stop right there.
[01:37:50.488 --> 01:37:51.489]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[01:37:51.529 --> 01:37:53.709]  Now, I'm gonna explain to you mammal psychology.
[01:37:53.749 --> 01:37:56.210]  They study dog trading under Pavlov, the Russian.
[01:37:57.230 --> 01:38:02.932]  Humans keep dogs more often than cats because we're most similar to dogs in our pack psychology.
[01:38:03.793 --> 01:38:04.993]  Now, he's the little one.
[01:38:07.082 --> 01:38:08.063]  He's the little one.
[01:38:08.623 --> 01:38:09.744]  He's the littlest one.
[01:38:10.425 --> 01:38:14.988]  And remember, when you're 5, you look up to the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 year olds.
[01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:28.059]  And so they all dance first, and then he dances at the end, and everyone turns and gives him attention, and he goes up the chain in the pack towards alpha male.
[01:38:29.724 --> 01:38:32.926]  And so the message is, you'll be popular if you take this shot.
[01:38:33.266 --> 01:38:37.709]  All psych warfare by the Pentagon, brainwashing your children.
[01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:40.711]  Here it is, the savage manipulation.
[01:38:40.731 --> 01:38:45.315]  So the little puppy sees the bigger dogs in the pack that he admires.
[01:38:46.095 --> 01:38:49.257]  When he says, I'm going to get the shot, they all suddenly turn and go, ah!
[01:38:49.577 --> 01:38:51.299]  And he's the center of everything.
[01:38:51.919 --> 01:38:53.720]  Oh, God, bring me the brain damage.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:55.021]  Bring me the sterilization.
[01:38:55.061 --> 01:38:55.942]  Bring me the cancer.
[01:38:56.422 --> 01:38:57.643]  Oh, God, sterilize me.
[01:38:58.183 --> 01:39:03.287]  It might hurt a little, but it's going to help a lot, like the White House science czar says, sterilizing him.
[01:39:03.647 --> 01:39:05.589]  Let's show him getting sterilized right here.
[01:39:05.909 --> 01:39:07.210]  He's a good member of the pack.
[01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:10.312]  He joins the military, like all the TV shows brainwashing kids.
[01:39:10.572 --> 01:39:11.132]  G.I.
[01:39:11.173 --> 01:39:12.794]  Joe, great American hero.
[01:39:13.014 --> 01:39:13.694]  Go Joe!
[01:39:13.894 --> 01:39:14.315]  Here it is.
[01:39:28.689 --> 01:39:37.014]  This is totally sick.
[01:39:37.635 --> 01:39:40.596]  Let's go out to break and I'll come back and take a few final calls.
[01:39:40.637 --> 01:39:42.518]  Let's go out to break with
[01:39:45.066 --> 01:39:57.255]  The parent company, News Corp, they released this on MySpace and TV, bragging that they're brainwashing you, that global warming's man-made, and we need to do something about it, with all this fear.
[01:39:58.255 --> 01:40:07.161]  And then meanwhile, Fox TV criticizes Ron Paul and other people, and Cavuto and others are kind of sideways on whether it's real or not.
[01:40:07.942 --> 01:40:10.524]  But then their publications say, don't worry, it's not going to pass.
[01:40:10.824 --> 01:40:11.845]  So you stand down.
[01:40:12.345 --> 01:40:13.246]  Let's go to the next level.
[01:40:14.235 --> 01:40:15.236]  Oh, we're queuing it up right now?
[01:40:15.296 --> 01:40:20.340]  Yeah, if people want to find it, it's Fox Admits to Planting Political Brainwashing in Popular TV Shows.
[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:22.481]  This is from March 6th of this year.
[01:40:23.582 --> 01:40:26.444]  But I really think this illustrates things well for people.
[01:40:27.505 --> 01:40:28.746]  Oh, you guys didn't know we were going to that?
[01:40:32.348 --> 01:40:32.649]  Okay.
[01:40:33.349 --> 01:40:36.031]  Sometimes these web videos... Alright, here we go.
[01:40:36.051 --> 01:40:37.893]  We'll go out to break with it and come back with the rest of it.
[01:40:37.913 --> 01:40:38.213]  Here it is.
[01:40:42.614 --> 01:40:54.861]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[01:40:55.121 --> 01:40:56.322]  How to stay for long record.
[01:40:56.342 --> 01:40:58.103]  Global warming.
[01:40:58.403 --> 01:40:58.943]  Probably.
[01:40:59.223 --> 01:41:03.406]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:08.090]  Three years is a long ways away.
[01:41:08.190 --> 01:41:12.452]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[01:41:13.192 --> 01:41:14.112]  Just had another thought.
[01:41:15.373 --> 01:41:18.534]  What if the Scared Straight Show had a green message to it?
[01:41:18.754 --> 01:41:26.697]  The biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into some of our content.
[01:41:26.917 --> 01:41:27.537]  I don't follow.
[01:41:28.217 --> 01:41:30.478]  Green, it means environmentally friendly.
[01:41:30.598 --> 01:41:37.928]  The lifeblood of our company is the quality of our TV shows, and we would accomplish nothing if we compromised that quality.
[01:41:38.048 --> 01:41:41.052]  Going green doesn't fit with the rest of the show.
[01:41:41.553 --> 01:41:42.374]  We're working magic.
[01:41:42.414 --> 01:41:42.855]  Make it fit.
[01:41:43.095 --> 01:41:45.639]  Hey Brian, I'm not going to recycle this aluminum can.
[01:41:45.659 --> 01:41:46.941]  I'm just going to throw it in the trash.
[01:41:50.152 --> 01:42:12.352]  The most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production, as well as work in a message about global warming, about environmental changes, and about empowering people to take responsibility.
[01:42:12.632 --> 01:42:14.614]  Why are your wedding programs bumpy?
[01:42:16.607 --> 01:42:24.028]  We're having a green wedding, so after the reception, our guests can plant the programs, grow flowers.
[01:42:24.648 --> 01:42:29.249]  I could live in the sea and make friends with a whale, and we'd live in a sunken pirate ship.
[01:42:29.869 --> 01:42:31.030]  That'd show global warming!
[01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:35.770]  We've come up with, you know, all sorts of strategies for lessening our footprint.
[01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:41.071]  Everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles on our production.
[01:42:41.511 --> 01:42:42.612]  Look at all these Hummers.
[01:42:42.872 --> 01:42:44.492]  What kind of jerk would drive one of those?
[01:42:46.345 --> 01:42:47.946]  Dude, this car kicks ass!
[01:42:48.966 --> 01:42:51.968]  Yeah, rubs fell!
[01:42:52.228 --> 01:42:53.468]  We're using biodiesel.
[01:42:59.391 --> 01:43:01.032]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[01:43:01.152 --> 01:43:02.612]  Say no to toxic overload.
[01:43:02.672 --> 01:43:03.753]  Say no to chemicals.
[01:43:03.993 --> 01:43:05.794]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[01:43:05.934 --> 01:43:14.638]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[01:43:14.718 --> 01:43:19.983]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[01:43:20.143 --> 01:43:21.764]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[01:43:21.944 --> 01:43:29.351]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[01:43:29.431 --> 01:43:33.515]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[01:43:33.615 --> 01:43:36.117]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.

[01:44:00.493 --> 01:44:04.161]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:04.521 --> 01:44:07.527]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:07.768 --> 01:44:09.191]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:44:09.884 --> 01:44:12.546]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:12.566 --> 01:44:18.789]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:18.949 --> 01:44:23.972]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:24.492 --> 01:44:27.294]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:44:27.414 --> 01:44:34.118]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:34.238 --> 01:44:36.359]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:36.579 --> 01:44:37.919]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:38.179 --> 01:44:40.460]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.480]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:47.581]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:47.901 --> 01:44:52.683]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:52.923 --> 01:44:57.024]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:00.311]  The once mighty U.S.
[01:45:00.351 --> 01:45:02.953]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[01:45:03.374 --> 01:45:05.976]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[01:45:06.056 --> 01:45:08.858]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[01:45:09.238 --> 01:45:13.021]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[01:45:13.522 --> 01:45:17.665]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders.
[01:45:18.005 --> 01:45:21.148]  And Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[01:45:21.628 --> 01:45:22.309]  Prepare now.
[01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:24.101]  We're good to go.
[01:45:46.513 --> 01:45:47.913]  Look, we're basically out of time.
[01:45:48.014 --> 01:45:50.214]  I'm going to try to jam in Mike and Elizabeth.
[01:45:50.274 --> 01:45:51.595]  I got John, Lamont, Jason.
[01:45:51.615 --> 01:45:52.655]  Call me back tomorrow.
[01:45:52.675 --> 01:45:53.555]  I'll get you on.
[01:45:53.575 --> 01:45:56.316]  But Mike and Elizabeth, I'm going to try to go to you here in a moment.
[01:46:12.261 --> 01:46:14.282]  I want to thank a few of the sponsors today.
[01:46:14.762 --> 01:46:16.143]  FrontSight.com.
[01:46:16.923 --> 01:46:21.485]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder of FrontSight Firearms Training Institute?
[01:46:21.505 --> 01:46:25.026]  He's offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[01:46:25.586 --> 01:46:32.609]  Five days of world-class gun training at the FrontSight Firearms Training Institute and a secured 30-state weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:36.911]  Act fast and they'll give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:46:37.251 --> 01:46:41.333]  They got two-day, four-day, five-day courses and a lot of free stuff online as well at FrontSight.
[01:46:41.693 --> 01:46:46.668]  Like the front of your rifle, FrontSight.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:49.355 --> 01:46:51.437]  Also, look, I'm not going to belabor this.
[01:46:51.537 --> 01:46:55.980]  Ted Anderson is selling out of the gold he bought at the $1,000 level with it above $1,140.
[01:46:57.061 --> 01:46:59.083]  He's selling out of this.
[01:46:59.143 --> 01:46:59.823]  It's done tonight.
[01:47:00.264 --> 01:47:00.924]  Give him a call.
[01:47:00.944 --> 01:47:01.545]  800-686-2237.
[01:47:01.565 --> 01:47:03.366]  800-686-2237.
[01:47:03.566 --> 01:47:07.950]  He's never offered a deal.
[01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:09.391]  Never has it been this good.
[01:47:09.411 --> 01:47:10.492]  He's had a lot of great deals.
[01:47:10.552 --> 01:47:11.313]  This is the best.
[01:47:12.013 --> 01:47:13.494]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Michigan.
[01:47:13.534 --> 01:47:14.295]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:47:15.436 --> 01:47:15.696]  Alex.
[01:47:16.417 --> 01:47:16.697]  Hey, buddy.
[01:47:17.614 --> 01:47:28.063]  Yeah, listen, I love your radio show and all the work you do, and I love people like Officer Jack McLam and Dr. Deagle, but buddy, you got my blood pressure up today.
[01:47:29.364 --> 01:47:43.537]  I can turn on CNN, Fox News, or listen to Glenn Beck if I want to listen to New World Order horse crap, but when I turn your program on, I don't want to hear some gutter rat promoting New World Order's satanic agenda.
[01:47:43.993 --> 01:47:52.378]  Like I say, I'm not here to chew your rear end, I love you, I love what you're doing, but we do not want to hear some gutter rat promoting this trash.
[01:47:52.418 --> 01:47:55.080]  Let me be clear with you, Mike, and just hold your horses for a minute.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:04.105]  I disagreed with him, and I saw him on national TV admit the New World Order takeover, and so I didn't really know who this guy was.
[01:48:04.185 --> 01:48:07.888]  I'd seen him on TV a few times, so I got him on and we learned a lot.
[01:48:08.328 --> 01:48:12.209]  And a lot of people that are in denial about this stuff are now going to awaken.
[01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:14.390]  If I could get Henry Kissinger on, I would.
[01:48:14.730 --> 01:48:16.631]  If I could get David Rockefeller on, I would.
[01:48:16.831 --> 01:48:23.913]  I don't think this guy is consciously doing the things they're doing, but I think it was very informative.
[01:48:23.953 --> 01:48:27.715]  This is not just some religious cult where it's only one view.
[01:48:27.735 --> 01:48:31.576]  I have people on here that I disagree with a lot.
[01:48:32.316 --> 01:48:37.420]  And I didn't know that all that was going to happen when he was on with us, but I will tell you I plan on having him back on.
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:40.782]  I mean, Mike, give me a little bit of credit that I might know what I'm doing here.
[01:48:40.802 --> 01:48:43.684]  I mean, I saw the guy on TV and said, wow, let's get that guy on.
[01:48:43.724 --> 01:48:44.165]  We call.
[01:48:44.225 --> 01:48:47.047]  He knows who I am, which shows they're listening.
[01:48:47.567 --> 01:48:48.608]  And we got him on the show.
[01:48:49.468 --> 01:48:53.251]  And so, I mean, I think it was very positive.
[01:48:53.271 --> 01:48:55.853]  You don't normally hear that on mainstream television.
[01:48:56.694 --> 01:48:59.876]  I mean, so you're saying it wasn't informative to have him on?
[01:49:00.543 --> 01:49:08.409]  No, it's that he's promoting his agenda and, you know, it's like I want to hear you and hear what you got to say.
[01:49:08.449 --> 01:49:10.711]  And like I said, I love your show and I love your work.
[01:49:11.277 --> 01:49:15.079]  But it's like, you know, I feel like, you know, it's like having Glenn Beck on.
[01:49:15.119 --> 01:49:16.920]  What do we need to hear that trash for?
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:18.841]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:49:18.881 --> 01:49:20.261]  I would have Glenn Beck on in a minute.
[01:49:20.842 --> 01:49:21.982]  Let's try to get Glenn Beck again.
[01:49:22.042 --> 01:49:26.124]  I'd love to have him on and ask why he stabs Ron Paul in the back.
[01:49:26.164 --> 01:49:26.664]  I mean, come on.
[01:49:26.944 --> 01:49:29.766]  Mike, I hear what you're saying, but I respectfully disagree with you.
[01:49:30.606 --> 01:49:32.947]  And I would love to have, I've tried to get Rothkopf back on.
[01:49:32.987 --> 01:49:33.708]  He won't come on now.
[01:49:34.708 --> 01:49:36.530]  And I want to get Holbrook on.
[01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:38.031]  I mean, I want to get all these people on.
[01:49:38.811 --> 01:49:43.435]  I didn't exactly know where that guy was going to go with all that, but that was a pleasant surprise getting to see all that revealed.
[01:49:43.455 --> 01:49:49.500]  You know, we get to hear about Nick Rockefeller saying things to Aaron Russo, but it's one thing to hear about, another thing to hear directly from him.
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:52.302]  But that guy's a true believer.
[01:49:53.323 --> 01:49:56.025]  Elizabeth in Tennessee, you got about 30 seconds, go ahead.
[01:49:58.433 --> 01:49:58.653]  Alex?
[01:49:59.073 --> 01:50:00.534]  Yes, Elizabeth, welcome.
[01:50:00.554 --> 01:50:00.614]  Hey!
[01:50:01.214 --> 01:50:03.114]  I'm so glad to be on with you.
[01:50:03.314 --> 01:50:04.915]  I do give you a lot of credit, Alex.
[01:50:05.235 --> 01:50:08.256]  I appreciate you so much and pray for you and your family.
[01:50:08.276 --> 01:50:14.157]  I just also wanted to take exception with what Damon Vickers had to say.
[01:50:14.637 --> 01:50:17.618]  His perception of Americans as being fat and lazy and sitting in our
[01:50:18.138 --> 01:50:19.599]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
