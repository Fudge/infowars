[00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:09.327]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:10.908]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:12.468]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.468 --> 00:00:16.650]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.712]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:28.220]  It is Monday, the 16th day of November 2009.
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.143]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:36.344]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:39.906]  And Damon Vickers joins us in the third hour.
[00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:45.610]  He was on CNBC a week ago.
[00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.932]  Warning that world government is being established.
[00:00:50.419 --> 00:01:03.663]  And he heads up a major financial firm, so we're going to be talking to him coming up later in the radio broadcast.
[00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.783]  Damon Vickers.
[00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:09.564]  We look forward to that.
[00:01:09.564 --> 00:01:11.805]  I'm also working on Webster Tarpley.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:27.454]  I just told my producers to get him on this morning because he's written an amazing analysis that he sent to us to post at InfoWars.com titled, Major Hassan of Fort Hood, a patsy and a drill gone live?
[00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:32.760]  So we'll be covering that either way whether he joins us or not today.
[00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:39.890]  Some of the other vitally important news in front of me.
[00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.212]  Dollar falls, sending gold record high $1,133.20 an ounce.
[00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:45.593]  And the dollar fell to a record low.
[00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:46.253]  Retail sales show gain.
[00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:01.019]  Of course, a little game.
[00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:03.321]  We're going into the Christmas season, holiday season.
[00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:05.682]  But manufacturing gauge slips.
[00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:07.384]  We're importing it.
[00:02:07.384 --> 00:02:09.885]  So it doesn't matter if the dollar's weakening.
[00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:11.687]  That's supposed to increase manufacturing.
[00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:14.329]  There is no manufacturing.
[00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.773]  And that's not helped by the fact... I saw this last night.
[00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:22.635]  I watched part of Obama's speech that was blacked out in China.
[00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.493]  Chinese government wouldn't broadcast his speech to university students.
[00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:31.536]  Hand-picked Communist Party members, by the way.
[00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:33.797]  But WhiteHouse.gov does have it.
[00:02:33.797 --> 00:02:41.824]  And in the speech, he said that China has better roads and better trains and better industry and that everybody wants to move there.
[00:02:41.824 --> 00:02:46.347]  He bad-mouthed America.
[00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:47.988]  You see, a lot of what the U.S.
[00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:50.490]  is is an image in the world.
[00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.753]  And so the elite are signifying the end of this country.
[00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:06.198]  And then I get to hear neocons like Laura Ingraham driving into work this morning, blaming it on the Democrats and saying she's been fighting globalism and fighting the big banks.
[00:03:06.198 --> 00:03:10.522]  I mean, unbelievable when both parties are bought and paid for by the same interest.
[00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:15.287]  And these people didn't say a word about China when Bush was in office.
[00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:19.611]  And as soon as the Republicans back in office, they'll get back on board with the whole globalist agenda.
[00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:24.983]  Watching their sliminess.
[00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:27.204]  I mean, I don't like the Democrats.
[00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:30.266]  Obviously, they're globalists through and through.
[00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:32.447]  But at least they admit they don't like this country.
[00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:34.348]  At least they admit they want to bring this country down.
[00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:37.810]  At least they admit they want to make everybody dependent on government.
[00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.293]  There's nothing worse than the Republicans who run around posing as if they're not for dependence and collectivism.
[00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:46.094]  Makes me sick.
[00:03:46.094 --> 00:03:47.655]  They really make me want to throw up.
[00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:55.559]  Meanwhile, Lou Dobbs, because he was the real deal and was non-partisan and exposed the North American Union, he's gone!
[00:03:55.559 --> 00:04:02.228]  Alright, I'm starting to rant.
[00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:05.172]  World leaders back delay to final climate deal.
[00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:06.574]  That's a ruse out of Reuters.
[00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:22.591]  Obama branded Groveler-in-Chief, that's the male online, branded Groveler-in-Chief after deep bow to Emperor, son of Japanese ruler, who authorized Pearl Harbor attack.
[00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:27.894]  And the British newspaper, as well as Canadian paper, show how no American president has ever bowed to this guy.
[00:04:27.894 --> 00:04:31.536]  They show photos and videos of past presidents meeting with him.
[00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:36.218]  Obama didn't just do the polite Japanese bow, he did the servant bow.
[00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:50.577]  That a servant or an employee of someone does a full bow, similar to a theater bow in Shakespearean, Thespian tradition, theatrical tradition.
[00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:51.577]  So we'll talk about that.
[00:04:51.577 --> 00:04:54.179]  Why is he doing this?
[00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:57.240]  Gore's getting protested everywhere he goes with our listeners.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.521]  It's beautiful.
[00:04:58.521 --> 00:04:59.762]  And the Army, well, we'll tell you about it.
[00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:03.377]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:08.698]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.698 --> 00:05:10.739]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:15.741]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:16.921]  How much do you want?
[00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:18.061]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:19.942]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:19.942 --> 00:05:21.022]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.022 --> 00:05:23.203]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.203 --> 00:05:24.543]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.543 --> 00:05:26.084]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.084 --> 00:05:27.124]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:28.626]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:05:28.626 --> 00:05:31.349]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.934]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:38.759]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.980]  How much will you need?
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.881]  We don't know.
[00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:41.983]  How much do you want?
[00:05:41.983 --> 00:05:42.724]  All you can get.
[00:05:42.724 --> 00:05:43.705]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:47.046]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:54.569]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:01.612]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.com.
[00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:05.633]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:08.874]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.874 --> 00:06:10.295]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:13.677]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.677 --> 00:06:20.058]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.058 --> 00:06:25.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:35.242]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:37.704]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:37.704 --> 00:06:39.285]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.285 --> 00:06:41.747]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.747 --> 00:06:43.868]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:43.868 --> 00:06:49.032]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.032 --> 00:07:00.320]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.342]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.831]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:06.613]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[00:07:06.613 --> 00:07:10.596]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:15.139]  Beta Prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.723]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.
[00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:25.587]  Beta Prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:34.653]  And Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 saltpaw metal capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one Beta Prostate.
[00:07:34.653 --> 00:07:37.675]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.

[00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:50.943]  This offer is for one free bottle per household.
[00:07:50.943 --> 00:07:53.803]  Call now and try Beta Prostate for free.
[00:07:53.803 --> 00:07:54.323]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:55.763]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[00:07:55.763 --> 00:08:03.365]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:11.306]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.306 --> 00:08:16.027]  The United States is in the final phases of being completely collapsed.
[00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:21.657]  This is going to be hard on everyone, including even the wealthy.
[00:08:21.657 --> 00:08:26.559]  The nouveau riche bought into globalism in the last 50 years is trendy and cool.
[00:08:26.559 --> 00:08:29.660]  We have now been completely de-industrialized.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.360]  We are no longer an industrial country.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.661]  We rate industrially like a third world nation.
[00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:44.384]  The president is now running around all over China and the United States and Europe bad-mouthing our industry and our country is not a good place to invest by design.
[00:08:45.711 --> 00:09:03.314]  The globalists have bragged, Maury Strong and countless others, that the plan, starting in the 40s, was to de-industrialize the United States and then have a balance of power globally where only the central banks have control.
[00:09:03.314 --> 00:09:07.735]  And we're now being told all over the news, we have to do what China says.
[00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:09.955]  China is our boss.
[00:09:09.955 --> 00:09:11.996]  China is the new superpower.
[00:09:11.996 --> 00:09:13.696]  America is a thing of the past.
[00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:17.481]  We're being told to be unconfident.
[00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.144]  We're being told that we deserve what's happening.
[00:09:20.144 --> 00:09:33.699]  We're being told that only the United States and Western Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand will have to implement the carbon taxes that will fully destroy the remnants, the wreckage of our industry.
[00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:34.600]  I want to play you
[00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:36.189]  A clip.
[00:09:36.189 --> 00:09:44.956]  Now, watching his speech and his question and answer from China and seeing another speech he gave in Japan, he's saying similar things.
[00:09:44.956 --> 00:09:50.020]  But this is what Obama said back in August in the United States.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:56.505]  So, this is a talking point that President Obama puts out letting us know.
[00:09:56.505 --> 00:10:03.571]  And then he twists it and says, go along with his agenda, the globalist agenda of cap and trade, or we won't get our industry.
[00:10:05.868 --> 00:10:19.864]  The cap-and-trade program, which is just one part of the taxation flotilla, armada hitting us right now, will fully destroy the last remnants that we've got left.
[00:10:19.864 --> 00:10:25.471]  And then the police state's going to unfold on the sectors that are still intact.
[00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:31.581]  Beaching everyone on the floating wreckage of government.
[00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:38.344]  All that is meant to be left is government, so we can hand over what's left of our economy to private offshore corporations.
[00:10:38.344 --> 00:10:44.768]  To destroy our economy and vertically integrate it under globalist control, it must be fully imploded.
[00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:47.669]  Both parties are involved.
[00:10:47.669 --> 00:10:55.633]  The only major Republicans speaking out against this are Michelle Bachmann, and of course, Congressman Ron Paul, Louie Gohmert, and a few others.
[00:10:57.432 --> 00:10:57.972]  Here it is.
[00:10:57.972 --> 00:11:00.373]  Here's Barack Obama.
[00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:03.614]  Everybody's watching what's going on in Beijing right now in the Olympics.
[00:11:03.614 --> 00:11:08.595]  Think about the amount of money that China has spent on infrastructure.
[00:11:08.595 --> 00:11:24.079]  Their ports, their train systems, their airports are all vastly superior to us now, which means if you're a corporation deciding where to do business, you're starting to think Beijing looks like a pretty good option.
[00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:25.499]  Why aren't we doing the same thing?
[00:11:27.657 --> 00:11:34.903]  Well, because globalist Henry Kissinger and George Shultz and David Rockefeller run the United States.
[00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:38.866]  I mean, you know full well why that's happening, President Obama.
[00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:39.987]  You gotta love these people.
[00:11:39.987 --> 00:11:55.921]  They create the crises, they create the banking implosion, they implement the tax exemptions for corporations to leave the United States, and then they run around grandstanding in the aftermath of globalization and say the answer is more globalization.
[00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:03.943]  And for the feds to give the state some of their money back for a highway program, you have to agree to make it a toll road.
[00:12:03.943 --> 00:12:25.590]  Taxpayers pay for the roads, 8,000 miles of them in Texas, and then they just hand them over to foreign corporations, like Centra of Spain, and then local papers all over Texas attack me, Alex Jones, by name, and Ron Paul, and say we're conspiracy theorists that the highways even exist.
[00:12:26.567 --> 00:12:33.792]  Yes, national news, Fox, CNN, I have the video clips, we've played them, where they say there is no trans-Texas corridor.
[00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:41.356]  There are no super-NAFTA highways being built, and old roads being taken over and new roads being set up under their control.
[00:12:41.356 --> 00:12:47.220]  The Austin Chronicle writes multiple articles calling me a conspiracy theorist, saying that Sintra isn't Spanish.
[00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.393]  Think of the magnitude of the lying of these people.
[00:12:53.393 --> 00:12:54.955]  How dumb they think you are.
[00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:56.856]  How stupid they think you are.
[00:12:56.856 --> 00:13:03.462]  The unlimited, unrivaled in human history, lying.
[00:13:03.462 --> 00:13:05.243]  Saying polar bears can't swim.
[00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.105]  That the ice packs are all melting.
[00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:08.246]  Total lies.
[00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.708]  Saying carbon dioxide is a deadly poison.
[00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:11.589]  Total lies.
[00:13:15.473 --> 00:13:19.594]  Everything is a complete, over-the-top, filthy lie.
[00:13:19.594 --> 00:13:30.117]  I remember three years ago, Al Gore would testify in Congress and say that he's making no money off of all of his environmental initiatives that are environmental in name only.
[00:13:30.117 --> 00:13:34.058]  Now he goes around saying, I'm proud of it, of course I make money off of it.
[00:13:34.058 --> 00:13:38.540]  We have those clips, the old clips of him saying he's not doing it, with the new clips of him admitting it.
[00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:46.792]  See, they deny, deny, deny, deny, deny, deny, deny, while they're building it and setting it up.
[00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:51.414]  And now that they've completely destroyed us and overrun us, they're going, yeah, of course I'm making money.
[00:13:51.414 --> 00:14:01.158]  Of course you're gonna pay your taxes to my private carbon trading organization.
[00:14:01.158 --> 00:14:06.500]  I'm gonna go over all of this today.
[00:14:08.666 --> 00:14:09.767]  I'm going to cover all of them.
[00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:17.011]  We're going to talk to Heather, Colin, Ian, Steven, Delilah, and many others.
[00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:23.654]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:28.837]  And then later in the broadcast, I want to go over Dollar Falls sending gold a record high.
[00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:32.979]  Retail sales show gain, but manufacturing gauge slips.
[00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:36.481]  World leaders back delay to final climate deal.
[00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:37.342]  That's propaganda.
[00:14:38.695 --> 00:14:45.299]  Obama branded Grobbler-in-Chief after deep bow to Emperor's son of Japanese ruler who authorized Pearl Harbor attack?
[00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:46.680]  Well, of course!
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.622]  And he bowed to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia!
[00:14:49.622 --> 00:15:00.168]  And I don't mean just a little bow, I mean a full, flat-out bow where he was right along with the floor.
[00:15:00.168 --> 00:15:01.829]  Complete bow.
[00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:03.690]  You know, the theater bow.
[00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.952]  Like actors do at the end of a play.
[00:15:06.952 --> 00:15:07.953]  The good news is
[00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.596]  Everywhere Al Gore goes, we have listeners calling us.
[00:15:12.596 --> 00:15:19.459]  Everywhere he goes, our listeners call into the radio show, they plug where he's going to be in a week, and here's the Palm Beach Post.
[00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:26.803]  Gore's presentation on climate change draws 800 as 200 protesters gather outside, and guess what happened?
[00:15:26.803 --> 00:15:30.906]  A third of the article is quotes from the protesters.
[00:15:30.906 --> 00:15:37.409]  You see, now he does it just to go get TV and newspaper coverage without the truth being injected.
[00:15:37.409 --> 00:15:38.750]  Then it says in the article,
[00:15:40.987 --> 00:15:50.575]  Cap and trade, don't be fooled, Al Gore will make billions, read a sign carried by Alan Tudor who drove from Tampa to attend Saturday's protest.
[00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:54.759]  The article goes on to admit Al Gore is making billions off of it.
[00:15:54.759 --> 00:16:00.984]  Gore's favorite green product, another sign read, your money in his pocket.
[00:16:00.984 --> 00:16:05.168]  That's a good one, Gore's favorite green product, your money in his pocket.
[00:16:05.168 --> 00:16:05.889]  Gore spokesman
[00:16:07.455 --> 00:16:13.319]  Colleen Crider said Gore's investments are consistent with positions he has held for decades.
[00:16:13.319 --> 00:16:15.940]  Oh, see they gotta respond to that now.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:24.285]  Because we're, the American people, true patriots, from across the political spectrum, are waking up and going out and confronting this bastard.
[00:16:24.285 --> 00:16:25.786]  And the crowds are gonna get bigger and bigger.
[00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:27.487]  Remember?
[00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:28.488]  Five, six months ago?
[00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:40.171]  It didn't matter if it was Rick Perry, the Republican governor of Texas, or whether it was Congressman Lloyd Doggett, the Democrat congressman from South Texas.
[00:16:40.171 --> 00:16:46.834]  Everywhere they went, they got booed because they're pro-NAFTA highway, pro-globalism, pro-government healthcare.
[00:16:46.834 --> 00:16:50.675]  Perry now is trying to talk like he's Ron Paul or Alex Jones.
[00:16:51.727 --> 00:16:53.088]  I think Obama's a socialist.
[00:16:53.088 --> 00:16:54.370]  I'm against this new world order.
[00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.691]  We might need to secede.
[00:16:55.691 --> 00:16:58.694]  It's all election rhetoric.
[00:16:58.694 --> 00:17:00.575]  He's a Bilderberg attendee.
[00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:05.780]  The person he's running against, Kay Bailey Hutchinson, is a Bilderberg steering committee member.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.102]  But remember what happened.
[00:17:08.102 --> 00:17:11.445]  They used that same military tactic of denial.
[00:17:11.445 --> 00:17:12.967]  The National News reported
[00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:15.822]  This is all staged!
[00:17:15.822 --> 00:17:20.724]  Lobbyists bust in, Republicans, to protest Lloyd Doggett.
[00:17:20.724 --> 00:17:37.272]  But we had listeners who happened to be there, happened to be at the grocery store at this one event, and they reported, in fact my next door neighbor reported, actually two doors down, that he was there just buying food with his kids and heard booing and hissing, and that it was the entire crowd.
[00:17:37.272 --> 00:17:38.973]  And that it was spontaneous.
[00:17:38.973 --> 00:17:43.315]  He only sent letters out to Democrats, Lloyd Doggett did, to come to the grocery store.
[00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.192]  To come to the Randalls.
[00:17:46.192 --> 00:17:49.736]  Right over in the same neighborhood where I used to live.
[00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:52.259]  In South Austin.
[00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:53.720]  But what did the National News say?
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.442]  They said, oh, it was all staged.
[00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:56.403]  Oh, this is all staged.
[00:17:56.403 --> 00:18:00.208]  And then a month later they had to admit, okay, it's not staged.
[00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:02.611]  See, because you're not allowed to go out and protest him.
[00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:05.153]  You're not allowed to go to a town hall meeting and tell
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.263]  A legislator that you don't agree with.
[00:18:09.263 --> 00:18:10.604]  No, no, that's impossible.
[00:18:10.604 --> 00:18:12.365]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:14.207]  No one disagrees with big government.
[00:18:14.207 --> 00:18:16.008]  No one disagrees with corruption.
[00:18:16.008 --> 00:18:20.452]  No one disagrees with NAFTA and GATT.
[00:18:20.452 --> 00:18:23.795]  And it started out with a few hundred people, mainly in Austin.
[00:18:23.795 --> 00:18:24.916]  Where did the Tea Party start?
[00:18:26.544 --> 00:18:33.066]  9-11 Truth in Boston, Mass., and 9-11 Truth in Austin, Texas, five years ago.
[00:18:33.066 --> 00:18:36.827]  Then Ron Paul picked up on it, three years ago.
[00:18:36.827 --> 00:18:43.490]  And the Republicans waltzed right in in the last year and took over our movement, just like that.
[00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.390]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.531]  Our people are now in that movement, educating from the inside out.
[00:18:48.531 --> 00:18:53.033]  The issue here, though, is people are waking up, people are taking action.
[00:18:54.554 --> 00:18:59.135]  There are hundreds of videos on YouTube of people confronting Al Gore.
[00:18:59.135 --> 00:19:07.477]  Remember what We Are Change started doing at my recommendation two years ago?
[00:19:07.477 --> 00:19:16.739]  Luke Radowsky, that idea of confronting Republicans and Democrats against globalization, going out and confronting those that are for it, people against it going out and confronting them.
[00:19:18.089 --> 00:19:19.991]  Now it's spread to Second Amendment groups.
[00:19:19.991 --> 00:19:22.333]  It's spread to land rights activists.
[00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:27.117]  It's spread to national sovereignty activists and anti-globalist activism.
[00:19:27.117 --> 00:19:34.443]  And now, instead of just having big marches that everybody ignores, there's thousands every week of little gatherings of hundreds.
[00:19:34.443 --> 00:19:36.244]  And now they're growing to thousands.
[00:19:36.244 --> 00:19:37.125]  Spontaneous
[00:19:38.246 --> 00:19:51.030]  Flash mobs, as the Pentagon calls them, where we go into their events at city councils, county commissioners, state houses, you name it, and take them over and shatter the illusion that the people are going along with this.
[00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:57.313]  I salute those out there confronting this pig, Al Gore, this criminal piece of trash.
[00:19:57.313 --> 00:19:58.033]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.379 --> 00:20:03.000]  Worried that inflation will destroy your savings?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.160]  Grab a pencil.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:13.184]  I'll tell you how to turn $10,000 into potentially $431,000 in 12 to 18 months, thanks to Obama.
[00:20:13.184 --> 00:20:15.725]  And this isn't about gold bullion or coins.
[00:20:15.725 --> 00:20:17.466]  It's about gold stocks.
[00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:18.926]  They have soared over 800% since the year 2000.
[00:20:21.287 --> 00:20:30.091]  This is with gold being less than $1,000, a figure that should go to between $1,500 and $2,500 according to Merrill Lynch and UBS.
[00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:41.315]  Even better, wait till you hear what Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter says in his free Investing in Gold kit.
[00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:47.398]  It highlights seven must-own stocks, including a stock with six-figure potential whose price has doubled
[00:20:49.838 --> 00:20:50.158]  Call 888-722-6600.
[00:20:50.158 --> 00:20:50.358]  That's 888-722-6600.
[00:20:50.358 --> 00:20:51.959]  Or go to the website, InflationSurvivalKit.com.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.321]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:03.182]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.182 --> 00:21:03.502]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.502 --> 00:21:08.545]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.545 --> 00:21:10.165]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.165 --> 00:21:10.926]  Startpage?
[00:21:10.926 --> 00:21:11.326]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.326 --> 00:21:12.427]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.427 --> 00:21:15.388]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.388 --> 00:21:19.270]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.132]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.392 --> 00:21:25.013]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.013 --> 00:21:26.594]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:26.594 --> 00:21:26.894]  Right!
[00:21:26.894 --> 00:21:30.215]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:30.215 --> 00:21:30.796]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:30.796 --> 00:21:32.136]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.136 --> 00:21:35.998]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:35.998 --> 00:21:39.779]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:44.942]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:21:44.942 --> 00:21:47.863]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:21:48.323 --> 00:21:50.086]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:21:50.086 --> 00:21:54.371]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:55.994]  That's StartPage.com
[00:22:00.635 --> 00:22:01.656]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:07.179]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:07.739]  I get it.
[00:22:07.739 --> 00:22:17.345]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:17.345 --> 00:22:18.526]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:18.766 --> 00:22:27.234]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:27.234 --> 00:22:30.637]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:30.637 --> 00:22:34.901]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:36.502]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:36.502 --> 00:22:40.466]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:40.466 --> 00:22:44.069]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:44.249 --> 00:22:45.151]  You should, too.
[00:22:45.151 --> 00:22:46.312]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:46.312 --> 00:22:49.237]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:49.237 --> 00:22:49.297]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.297 --> 00:22:49.357]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.357 --> 00:22:49.718]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.301]  The once mighty U.S.
[00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:04.322]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[00:23:04.322 --> 00:23:06.984]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[00:23:06.984 --> 00:23:10.166]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:14.448]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[00:23:14.448 --> 00:23:18.551]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders.
[00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:22.553]  And Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[00:23:22.553 --> 00:23:23.794]  Prepare now!
[00:23:23.794 --> 00:23:28.737]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[00:23:28.737 --> 00:23:33.841]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:34.541]  I'm ready for it.
[00:24:05.984 --> 00:24:08.686]  This is the real deal.
[00:24:08.686 --> 00:24:27.599]  Toe-to-toe info war with a scientific dictatorship sworn to bankrupt you, make you dependent on government, so you can be sterilized, so your children can be poisoned, so you can be forcibly inoculated, so world government can be brought into place.
[00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:30.061]  But for the New World Order, global government's only the beginning.
[00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:33.538]  Okay, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:34.959]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:34.959 --> 00:24:40.043]  I wanted to just add an observation.
[00:24:40.043 --> 00:24:48.929]  I drove to East Texas to take my son and daughter deer hunting Friday and Saturday.
[00:24:51.867 --> 00:25:02.736]  And I have never seen more state police, more local police, every side road, every small road, every highway, every five miles, the police out riding tickets.
[00:25:02.736 --> 00:25:06.679]  You know, they've tripled the number of police, more than tripled in the last decade.
[00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:11.884]  And they're there to revenue generate, ladies and gentlemen, and that's only one indicator
[00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:18.846]  Of all the new taxes and all the new regulations and the increases in taxes across the board.
[00:25:18.846 --> 00:25:20.887]  Take Travis County where I live.
[00:25:20.887 --> 00:25:25.190]  The housing market's easily down by 30%.
[00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:35.438]  My property tax, the rent I pay to the government, my property tax went up this year.
[00:25:35.438 --> 00:25:38.320]  It went up several thousand dollars.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.782]  It went up substantively.
[00:25:40.908 --> 00:25:46.910]  So my house is worth probably 20% the neighborhood I'm in, 20% less than it was two years ago.
[00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.731]  They don't care.
[00:25:48.731 --> 00:25:51.732]  I got a tax bill over 20% bigger.
[00:25:51.732 --> 00:25:53.953]  Total fraud!
[00:25:53.953 --> 00:25:56.514]  And most people don't even know how to challenge their property tax.
[00:25:56.514 --> 00:26:02.336]  I know how to challenge it and get it reduced under law, but I don't have the time.
[00:26:02.336 --> 00:26:03.976]  I don't have the time.
[00:26:03.976 --> 00:26:05.157]  It's arduous.
[00:26:05.157 --> 00:26:05.797]  It takes time.
[00:26:06.946 --> 00:26:19.001]  And I heard a local real estate show in Austin reporting yesterday that for the first time ever, Travis County is just ignoring many of them and just saying, we've got a backlog so therefore we're going to try to make you pay.
[00:26:22.469 --> 00:26:24.471]  The globalists are cutthroats.
[00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:25.893]  They don't care.
[00:26:25.893 --> 00:26:30.419]  They're going to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and pick the bones of this nation.
[00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:39.430]  California is putting taxes on television sets for the environment, taxes on light bulbs, satellite tracker boxes in the cars, taxes on ammunition.
[00:26:40.984 --> 00:26:43.065]  California is the model of the rest of the country.
[00:26:43.065 --> 00:26:45.145]  Other states are trying to pass environmental laws.
[00:26:45.145 --> 00:26:48.106]  Cities, like Austin, are passing carbon tax laws.
[00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:56.589]  It's already happening, with or without the Copenhagen Treaty, with or without the bill that they're set to pass in the next two weeks in the U.S.
[00:26:56.589 --> 00:27:02.391]  Senate, which will implement the Copenhagen Treaty here without the treaty even being signed yet.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:08.703]  They're set to bring it to the full floor tomorrow to take over healthcare.
[00:27:08.703 --> 00:27:12.165]  17 to 21 percent, depending on which index you look at, of the U.S.
[00:27:12.165 --> 00:27:14.706]  economy.
[00:27:14.706 --> 00:27:19.729]  One of the few industries we've got left!
[00:27:19.729 --> 00:27:25.673]  One of the few industries they can't export.
[00:27:25.673 --> 00:27:28.815]  And then I see articles like this one.
[00:27:30.166 --> 00:27:35.108]  Army sends infant to protective services mom to Afghanistan.
[00:27:35.108 --> 00:27:37.908]  Out of the inter-press service.
[00:27:37.908 --> 00:27:40.869]  Out of Ventura, California.
[00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:44.391]  Army Specialist Alexis Hutchinson got pregnant.
[00:27:44.391 --> 00:27:46.371]  She had the baby.
[00:27:46.371 --> 00:27:49.452]  They said you don't get to get a deferment now.
[00:27:49.452 --> 00:27:50.933]  You don't get to have time off.
[00:27:50.933 --> 00:27:54.294]  CPS took her baby.
[00:27:54.294 --> 00:27:57.014]  The Army sent the CPS to take her baby.
[00:27:57.014 --> 00:27:58.295]  Her mother doesn't get the baby.
[00:28:00.031 --> 00:28:04.052]  They said that, well, it's neglect that you would get pregnant while in the army.
[00:28:04.052 --> 00:28:10.814]  So see, before, when they made women get in the military, women signed up for the military, now they want a draft for women.
[00:28:10.814 --> 00:28:11.934]  Before, they'd let you out.
[00:28:11.934 --> 00:28:16.175]  You know, you stick men and women together, they start having sex, they start having babies.
[00:28:16.175 --> 00:28:17.335]  That's what humans do.
[00:28:17.335 --> 00:28:18.375]  That's what all mammals do.
[00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:20.116]  That's what all animals do.
[00:28:20.116 --> 00:28:22.236]  Now they take your baby.
[00:28:22.236 --> 00:28:27.958]  They take your baby and then say, here's an M16.
[00:28:27.958 --> 00:28:28.998]  A single mother's being
[00:28:29.912 --> 00:28:38.944]  Threatened with military court-martial if she does not agree to deploy to Afghanistan despite having been told she would be given extra time to find someone to care for her 11-month-old son while she's overseas.
[00:28:41.089 --> 00:28:45.690]  She's confined in Hunter Army Airfield near Savannah, Georgia after being arrested.
[00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.971]  Her son was placed in the custody of the foster care system.
[00:28:48.971 --> 00:28:50.492]  That's America!
[00:28:50.492 --> 00:28:54.173]  The Israelis don't take women's children when they get pregnant in the army.
[00:28:54.173 --> 00:28:56.654]  The Russians don't take women's children.
[00:28:56.654 --> 00:28:58.574]  The Russians pay women to have children.
[00:28:58.574 --> 00:29:00.915]  They're the only country, and Russia's got big problems.
[00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:08.753]  But in Russia, because they know they have 1.2 children for every two parents, they know they're dying.
[00:29:08.753 --> 00:29:14.197]  So Russia pays people to have children and lets you out of the military.
[00:29:14.197 --> 00:29:21.242]  No one in the world arrests women who get pregnant in the army.
[00:29:21.242 --> 00:29:23.303]  But America doesn't just arrest you.
[00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:25.665]  They take your child.
[00:29:25.665 --> 00:29:29.688]  Because we are the most evil, wicked nation.
[00:29:29.688 --> 00:29:31.990]  51 million butchered babies with abortion isn't enough.
[00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:38.932]  And they'll take the child and drug it up and run it through the system and get lots of money for the foster system.
[00:29:38.932 --> 00:29:41.314]  This is, this is the predatory nature.
[00:29:41.314 --> 00:29:46.676]  We have sickening, disgusting, Nazi government that's criminal.
[00:29:46.676 --> 00:29:47.277]  Wake up!
[00:29:47.277 --> 00:29:50.538]  It's only gonna get worse till we wake up!
[00:29:50.538 --> 00:29:51.939]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.939 --> 00:29:54.460]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.142]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.523 --> 00:30:03.526]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.526 --> 00:30:08.850]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.912]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:10.912 --> 00:30:15.917]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:15.917 --> 00:30:17.098]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.098 --> 00:30:18.219]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.219 --> 00:30:20.101]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.101 --> 00:30:21.182]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.182 --> 00:30:23.383]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.383 --> 00:30:24.725]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.725 --> 00:30:26.026]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.226 --> 00:30:31.489]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.489 --> 00:30:35.091]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.091 --> 00:30:38.893]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:38.893 --> 00:30:40.134]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.134 --> 00:30:41.034]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.034 --> 00:30:42.135]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.135 --> 00:30:42.875]  All you can get.
[00:30:42.875 --> 00:30:43.876]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.156 --> 00:30:47.198]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.198 --> 00:30:48.979]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:48.979 --> 00:30:49.900]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:04.898]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:31:04.898 --> 00:31:09.424]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:31:09.424 --> 00:31:11.707]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:31:11.707 --> 00:31:13.329]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:14.371]  There is a solution.
[00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:23.013]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:31:59.551 --> 00:32:06.515]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:32:06.515 --> 00:32:08.616]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:32:08.616 --> 00:32:10.857]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:32:10.857 --> 00:32:12.498]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:32:12.498 --> 00:32:16.820]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:32:49.316 --> 00:32:50.697]  Well, the 20 minutes with the President
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.743]  TwentyMinutesWithThePresident.com, you spell out 20 minutes.
[00:33:14.743 --> 00:33:24.174]  TwentyMinutesWithThePresident.com, link up on InfoWars.com, was so successful, we got well over 200 entries.
[00:33:24.174 --> 00:33:27.998]  I would say 30 of them or so are just dynamite.
[00:33:27.998 --> 00:33:29.600]  Another 100 or so are good.
[00:33:31.693 --> 00:33:37.678]  Sixty-seventy of them, and I'm just guesstimating the number, are okay.
[00:33:37.678 --> 00:33:39.260]  This is going to be an incredible job.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.422]  I talked to Charlie Sheen this morning.
[00:33:41.422 --> 00:33:45.665]  He is attempting today and tomorrow to spend hours and hours watching them all.
[00:33:45.665 --> 00:33:54.933]  He's been watching a lot of them as they come in, and it'll probably take a week or so, three or four days, to pick who he thinks the winners are going to be, and we've got to contact the winners.
[00:33:55.754 --> 00:33:57.355]  The first place winner who wins $14,000.
[00:33:57.355 --> 00:33:59.876]  The second place wins $1,000.
[00:33:59.876 --> 00:34:00.436]  Third place $500.
[00:34:00.436 --> 00:34:10.060]  And we've got a contact to make sure what day the first place winner can come on the radio show either late this week or next week to be on with Charlie Sheen.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.462]  And we're going to play the winner on air at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:14.462 --> 00:34:16.122]  All three of the winners.
[00:34:16.122 --> 00:34:17.083]  Unbelievable!
[00:34:17.623 --> 00:34:18.384]  Quality.
[00:34:18.384 --> 00:34:21.165]  Unbelievable amounts of work that went into this.
[00:34:21.165 --> 00:34:34.553]  And again, I just want to salute and thank everybody for contributing, because everyone who entered wins, because everyone that watches the videos, the millions of people that will see these videos over the years, will really see the hardcore evidence of 9-11, the 20 key bullet points.
[00:34:34.553 --> 00:34:38.055]  So, Charlie is just blown away by the response.
[00:34:38.055 --> 00:34:42.938]  I'm blown away by the response, and I want to thank everybody for what they've done.
[00:34:44.127 --> 00:34:45.330]  Just amazing.
[00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.034]  Amazing is the only word.
[00:34:47.034 --> 00:34:50.823]  I guess fantastic, incredible, overwhelming.
[00:34:50.823 --> 00:34:52.607]  Super, super job.
[00:34:52.607 --> 00:34:54.090]  Okay, I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.512]  And then I'm going to get into Obama bowing down to royalty, which no U.S.
[00:35:00.512 --> 00:35:01.773]  president's ever done.
[00:35:01.773 --> 00:35:08.376]  Our country was founded on letting royalty know that we think they're disgusting and filthy and a sick joke.
[00:35:08.376 --> 00:35:16.540]  Old women, old men that are corrupt, owning empires through oppression, wearing gold crowns, everyone bowing to them.
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:20.042]  I mean, it's just primitive beyond belief and a joke.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:37.702]  It flies in the face of the Declaration of Independence, all men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, that when government becomes destructive of these aims, it is our right, it is our duty to abolish those forms that we become accustomed to.
[00:35:39.755 --> 00:35:41.035]  To watch a U.S.
[00:35:41.035 --> 00:35:43.636]  President do this is stunning.
[00:35:43.636 --> 00:35:47.097]  But it's all part of globalization to have the President running around bad-mouthing America.
[00:35:47.097 --> 00:35:50.117]  That's what he's supposed to do to put down the country.
[00:35:50.117 --> 00:35:53.238]  The dollar plunging, gold exploding to all-time record highs.
[00:35:53.238 --> 00:35:56.299]  Just a huge stack of incredible news we're going to be covering today.
[00:35:56.299 --> 00:35:59.200]  And we have a special guest coming up in the third hour.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.040]  Right now, let's go to Heather in Indiana.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.280]  Heather, you're on the air.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.301]  Hi, Alex.
[00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:08.882]  I was calling to tell you a quick short story, and then I just want to get your view on something that we would value your opinion about.
[00:36:09.984 --> 00:36:11.345]  We have four kids.
[00:36:11.345 --> 00:36:15.069]  We just had our two-year-old in the hospital for pneumonia.
[00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:16.330]  No other tests came back.
[00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:18.592]  Of course, they're trying to run the flu test.
[00:36:18.592 --> 00:36:20.494]  Everything comes back negative.
[00:36:20.494 --> 00:36:24.378]  She's admitted basically for dehydration because she was so little.
[00:36:24.378 --> 00:36:25.999]  Because we do everything natural at home.
[00:36:25.999 --> 00:36:27.240]  We do the silver.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.962]  Thank God we heard about it on your show.
[00:36:28.962 --> 00:36:30.343]  I would have never known anything about it.
[00:36:32.714 --> 00:36:47.907]  Within minutes of them telling me, okay, it's pneumonia, we're just gonna keep her here for observation, everything's fine, I've got three nurses, the pediatrician, they've got gowns, masks, gloves, signs outside her door, all of a sudden now she's got the swine flu.
[00:36:48.487 --> 00:37:03.693]  Yeah, this is the new, and it's come out literally hundreds of times in mainstream media, that anyone who's sick at the hospital, they now say it's swine flu to create hype in the newspaper and on TV, and then later say, oh, your child didn't have swine flu.
[00:37:03.693 --> 00:37:08.255]  Then they try to give little bitty babies, which you're not supposed to, it's on the insert.
[00:37:08.255 --> 00:37:11.656]  They try to give them inoculations while they're already sick.
[00:37:12.236 --> 00:37:15.699]  Then that'll make them get sick many times or have seizures.
[00:37:15.699 --> 00:37:18.241]  Then they say it was the original swine flu that did it.
[00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:24.245]  Or they try to give them Tamiflu, which the inserts admit you're not supposed to give to small children or babies.
[00:37:24.245 --> 00:37:29.349]  So your baby is there surrounded by these ringwraiths right now, Heather?
[00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:31.351]  No, actually this was about a week and a half ago.
[00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:33.512]  It takes us forever to try to get onto your show.
[00:37:33.512 --> 00:37:35.034]  We've been trying to tell you about this.
[00:37:36.075 --> 00:37:37.957]  But, um, no, she's home now.
[00:37:37.957 --> 00:37:39.578]  She was better within 48 hours.
[00:37:39.578 --> 00:37:41.760]  Like I said, we give them the silver when they're sick.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.601]  I do the elderberry.
[00:37:42.601 --> 00:37:44.062]  I do all natural.
[00:37:44.062 --> 00:37:45.683]  But was it, was it the H1N1?
[00:37:47.009 --> 00:37:48.570]  No, it wasn't the H1N1.
[00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:49.950]  It had nothing to do with that.
[00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:54.432]  She had a chest x-ray that had showed that she had pneumonia.
[00:37:54.432 --> 00:37:58.654]  And all of a sudden it was, oh, she's got the H1N1 and the complications, pneumonia.
[00:37:58.654 --> 00:38:03.916]  We signed a piece of paper against medical advice to not give her the Tamiflu.
[00:38:03.916 --> 00:38:06.156]  Because they were trying to push that on her.
[00:38:06.156 --> 00:38:06.797]  And she's only two.
[00:38:06.797 --> 00:38:07.217]  No, I know.
[00:38:07.217 --> 00:38:09.718]  Listen, listen.
[00:38:09.718 --> 00:38:12.259]  I've got employees that have had
[00:38:13.379 --> 00:38:15.340]  Babies that are just sick.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.782]  So they go to the doctor and they try to say, here, here's a box of Tamiflu.
[00:38:19.782 --> 00:38:25.364]  That's like a doctor giving you antibiotics without swabbing the infection.
[00:38:25.364 --> 00:38:31.286]  They have to find out the right antibiotic to even attack certain types of bacteria, but they don't care.
[00:38:31.286 --> 00:38:34.367]  They just give you the antibiotics.
[00:38:34.367 --> 00:38:36.608]  And it's the same thing with the antivirals.
[00:38:36.608 --> 00:38:38.669]  And that's what's causing the deadly mutations.
[00:38:38.669 --> 00:38:41.070]  And now, even the Ukrainian government
[00:38:42.154 --> 00:38:51.941]  In the Sunday Express is saying that the different anti-flu drugs and vaccines have mutated into a super virus.
[00:38:51.941 --> 00:38:53.662]  This just gets crazier and crazier.
[00:38:54.113 --> 00:38:59.155]  No, what is crazy is that my youngest daughter had the flu test.
[00:38:59.155 --> 00:39:00.056]  They had to run it.
[00:39:00.056 --> 00:39:01.256]  It was negative.
[00:39:01.256 --> 00:39:06.559]  And then they want to say, well, 40 to 60 percent of the tests come back negative, but you've got it anyway.
[00:39:06.559 --> 00:39:08.860]  Now, with my eight-year-old... Well, it's a cult!
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.162]  Again, it's medical tyranny, where they're setting it up, where they do whatever they want to you.
[00:39:13.797 --> 00:39:16.058]  I completely understand and I agree with you 100%.
[00:39:16.058 --> 00:39:29.104]  My 8-year-old, who we had to take about 5 days later, same symptoms, I'm doing the natural stuff at home, but she has asthma and other things that, you know, with her help, so I kind of watch her just a little bit more, shouldn't have even have taken her.
[00:39:29.104 --> 00:39:31.505]  I ended up leaving before the visit was over.
[00:39:31.505 --> 00:39:33.306]  They didn't even run a test.
[00:39:33.306 --> 00:39:34.347]  They didn't do anything.
[00:39:34.347 --> 00:39:37.128]  And all my daughter has was like a croopy cough.
[00:39:37.128 --> 00:39:38.489]  She kind of gets it throughout the year.
[00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:54.466]  We know exactly what to do with it, but now all of a sudden... No, the drug companies, ma'am, have gone and paid off all the major hospitals, it's mainstream news, to just push their shots and their drugs, even when they don't even have flu, much less H1N1.
[00:39:54.466 --> 00:39:58.230]  They're turning the hospitals into pure snake oil quackery.
[00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:01.831]  That's exactly what they did with my eight-year-old, and they scared her half to death.
[00:40:01.831 --> 00:40:04.953]  I had to come home and tell her, you do not have the H1N1.
[00:40:04.953 --> 00:40:06.294]  They didn't even do a test on you.
[00:40:06.294 --> 00:40:07.334]  You have a little cough.
[00:40:07.334 --> 00:40:11.517]  Mommy's going to take care of it with the silver and the elderberry, and we'll get through this by ourselves.
[00:40:11.517 --> 00:40:12.197]  We don't need medication.
[00:40:12.197 --> 00:40:17.040]  Well, the big thing is the vitamin A and D and B and sunshine.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.302]  Yes, we do vitamin D3 every day.
[00:40:19.302 --> 00:40:20.903]  My children take the multivitamins.
[00:40:20.903 --> 00:40:22.424]  We have them on a great regimen.
[00:40:22.424 --> 00:40:24.285]  But this is what I wanted to ask you about real quick.
[00:40:24.898 --> 00:40:30.873]  Do you do any research on the vitamin B17 as a deficiency of why people get cancer or the SCFT?
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:39.923]  We've had a lot of medical doctors on that have talked about the B variants, saying that those are very important.
[00:40:39.923 --> 00:40:56.451]  Most of our illnesses in young people or in healthy folks are vitamin and mineral deficiencies because they put fertilizer on the crops that'll make the plants grow, but they're empty of nutrients and vitamins and cofactors and trace elements.
[00:40:57.211 --> 00:41:00.572]  And so, yes, I mean, I'm not here dispensing medical advice.
[00:41:00.572 --> 00:41:04.793]  I have medical doctors on who talk about general principles.
[00:41:04.793 --> 00:41:05.674]  Okay.
[00:41:05.674 --> 00:41:11.976]  Well, you keep doing what you're doing, and we have let everyone that we know watch Fall of the Republic, all of your movies.
[00:41:11.976 --> 00:41:23.239]  We'll keep trying to open everybody's minds that we know so we can get things going on our end because we are big supporters of you and appreciate all you do for everybody out there that needs to wake up and understand what's going on.
[00:41:23.919 --> 00:41:25.879]  Thank you so much, God bless you.
[00:41:25.879 --> 00:41:33.901]  But whether it's vitamin A, D, the B variants, silver, nano-silver, none of it is a silver bullet.
[00:41:33.901 --> 00:41:35.261]  None of it is perfect.
[00:41:35.261 --> 00:41:40.002]  Healthy food, lots of sleep, clean water, rest, low stress.
[00:41:40.002 --> 00:41:48.524]  There's major studies that screaming, yelling at your children, fighting in front of your children, that debases their immune system more than anything.
[00:41:48.524 --> 00:41:52.005]  And so you need to research the vitamins, the silver, all of it.
[00:41:52.005 --> 00:41:53.465]  You can overdo that as well.
[00:41:54.793 --> 00:42:01.619]  I mean, any drug, whether it's natural or unnatural, can have side effects.
[00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:07.764]  But notice how they're pushing Tamiflu, which Japan, it's illegal to give this to young children in Japan.
[00:42:07.764 --> 00:42:16.071]  The inserts of Tamiflu state that it can cause hallucinations, depression, illness, seizures.
[00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:21.636]  And everyone I know that has children, when they just go to the regular doctor, they're told, take this.
[00:42:21.636 --> 00:42:22.837]  I'm not gonna say any names.
[00:42:24.445 --> 00:42:31.670]  But my father went with me, rode with my son and my daughter, the two oldest, to go deer hunting this weekend.
[00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:39.636]  And a dentist that works under him, his son is asthmatic.
[00:42:39.636 --> 00:42:43.959]  And they gave him the seasonal shot and the H1N1.
[00:42:43.959 --> 00:42:47.421]  And he immediately had water go into his lungs within 24 hours.
[00:42:47.421 --> 00:42:49.883]  He immediately got seriously sick.
[00:42:49.883 --> 00:42:54.106]  I mean, they had to take him into the emergency room and
[00:42:55.615 --> 00:43:02.616]  The word came out, well it could have been a bad reaction with the flu shot, and the doctor, the dentist, was in denial with my dad.
[00:43:02.616 --> 00:43:13.819]  So my dad went to John Hopkins online and printed up the H1N1 and the regular seasonal flu shot insert that said, do not give it to asthmatics.
[00:43:13.819 --> 00:43:17.780]  Do not give it to asthmatics!
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:22.020]  And the dentist was in denial to my dad.
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.101]  Look, it's the stinking insert!
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:33.085]  And I had a caller Sunday on yesterday's show who called in and said at his university they were giving free H1N1 shots out.
[00:43:33.085 --> 00:43:38.049]  And so he printed off the H1N1 Norvitis printout.
[00:43:38.049 --> 00:43:46.875]  And he was handing hundreds out and the doctors and nurses came over and heckled him and called him a conspiracy theorist and tried to kick him out of there.
[00:43:46.875 --> 00:43:47.815]  And laughed at him.
[00:43:47.815 --> 00:43:54.520]  They were handing out the fake sheets that say there is no mercury, cannot cause Guillain-Barré or Guillain-Barré in English.
[00:43:55.657 --> 00:43:57.879]  Cannot cause auto-immunity problems.
[00:43:57.879 --> 00:43:59.760]  Cannot sterilize you.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:18.034]  They nationwide hand out a lying sheet, and then when you come with the insert stating the facts from the drug package, you're called a conspiracy theorist.
[00:44:18.034 --> 00:44:25.039]  Just like every day I Google my name, Alex Jones, and click news, and every day there are two, three, four, five mainstream news articles
[00:44:26.545 --> 00:44:27.967]  Saying I'm insane.
[00:44:27.967 --> 00:44:29.209]  There's no world government.
[00:44:29.209 --> 00:44:30.771]  There's no cap and trade.
[00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:31.892]  There's no police state.
[00:44:31.892 --> 00:44:33.935]  They're not face scanning you.
[00:44:33.935 --> 00:44:40.022]  The flu shot doesn't have mercury.
[00:44:40.022 --> 00:44:41.945]  That shows the elite are not invincible.
[00:44:44.062 --> 00:44:48.283]  Or they wouldn't be attacking little old Alex Jones every stinking day.
[00:44:48.283 --> 00:44:51.264]  Big national publications.
[00:44:51.264 --> 00:44:52.985]  I will tell you it's creepy though.
[00:44:52.985 --> 00:44:54.966]  Because they are really coming after me folks.
[00:44:54.966 --> 00:44:58.307]  They are really turning the heat up on old Alex Jones.
[00:44:58.307 --> 00:45:04.349]  And I need your prayers and support more than ever.
[00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:06.790]  It is mind-blowing.
[00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:10.311]  One of the big things that's mind-blowing is to have it come out in mainstream news
[00:45:11.684 --> 00:45:17.085]  That top Nazis and top white supremacists are FBI agents.
[00:45:17.085 --> 00:45:19.165]  I mean, it's been in the Boston Globe.
[00:45:19.165 --> 00:45:20.886]  It's been in the Miami Herald.
[00:45:20.886 --> 00:45:23.106]  It's been in the Orlando, what is it?
[00:45:23.106 --> 00:45:24.286]  The Sentinel.
[00:45:24.286 --> 00:45:30.867]  That all these top Nazis, like Hal Turner, who attacks me mercilessly.
[00:45:30.867 --> 00:45:34.388]  Because when people ask me about him, I go, he's a disinformation artist.
[00:45:34.388 --> 00:45:38.329]  And his internal emails got released two years ago that he was indeed a fed.
[00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:40.909]  And then now it's come out in federal court, he is a fed.
[00:45:42.094 --> 00:45:43.215]  Mainstream news.
[00:45:43.215 --> 00:45:53.639]  Why does the government fund fake Nazis to come out and attack me and say that I'm a Jewish agent, when I'm not?
[00:45:53.639 --> 00:45:58.182]  I disagree with a lot of things Israel does, and I criticize Israel, but I'm not an anti-Semite.
[00:45:58.182 --> 00:46:02.744]  Why does the government want to sic the Nazis on me, their followers?
[00:46:03.669 --> 00:46:07.893]  Because I expose that most Nazi groups are run by the Feds, and I've been proven right.
[00:46:07.893 --> 00:46:09.094]  Think about how creepy that is.
[00:46:09.094 --> 00:46:29.553]  And then, Breitbart, part of the operation run and founded by Matt Drudge, is writing articles every couple days, and this new one, without any evidence, just says, anti-Semites, don't like Hollywood,
[00:46:31.468 --> 00:46:37.284]  run by predominantly Jewish groups like Alex Jones.
[00:46:37.284 --> 00:46:37.745]  When I
[00:46:40.503 --> 00:46:55.168]  I'm criticized by the Nazi camp, who we know are federally funded and controlled, for pointing out a Reuters article a few years ago that the majority of major movie houses now are owned by Arab investors.
[00:46:55.168 --> 00:46:57.668]  Certainly, Jews run a lot of them, and I said that in the piece.
[00:46:57.668 --> 00:47:03.030]  It got clipped up and edited out where it sounded like I was making the false statement that Arabs own Hollywood.
[00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.971]  I said they own the majority stock, just like
[00:47:07.518 --> 00:47:09.999]  Much of the stock of News Corp is owned by Arabs.
[00:47:09.999 --> 00:47:14.882]  I was simply pointing out that the Saudi Arabians are deep in bed with this whole global system.
[00:47:14.882 --> 00:47:20.866]  So I have Breitbart attacking me with no evidence.
[00:47:20.866 --> 00:47:33.273]  I could sue them and win because it's meant to do damage to me, even though I'm a public figure, to lie about me with malice of forethought with intent to hurt me.
[00:47:33.273 --> 00:47:35.414]  So I've got this government-run group
[00:47:36.607 --> 00:47:37.828]  Neocon funded.
[00:47:37.828 --> 00:47:41.590]  Most of their advertisers on there are CIA, Army, you name it.
[00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.931]  Go look at the banners.
[00:47:43.931 --> 00:47:46.093]  And it's admitted the government's funding all these different groups.
[00:47:46.093 --> 00:47:49.314]  I've got them attacking me saying I'm an anti-Semite.
[00:47:49.314 --> 00:47:55.478]  And then on the other side I have the Nazis attacking me saying I work for Israel.
[00:47:55.478 --> 00:47:57.599]  Why are they all coming after me?
[00:47:57.599 --> 00:48:00.141]  Because I understand how the globalists operate.
[00:48:00.141 --> 00:48:01.201]  I understand their tricks.
[00:48:01.201 --> 00:48:02.942]  I understand their full game plan.
[00:48:02.942 --> 00:48:04.003]  We are mobilizing
[00:48:05.362 --> 00:48:16.807]  White people, black people, Germans, Jews, Asian, Christian, Muslim, it doesn't matter, against the globalist agenda that's just a bunch of Kinley, Madoff types robbing us.
[00:48:16.807 --> 00:48:17.848]  People like Al Gore.
[00:48:19.093 --> 00:48:21.414]  They don't want a message of unity against the globalists.
[00:48:21.414 --> 00:48:31.438]  They want us all in different camps, people that hate Catholics, people that hate Jews, people that bash me who are in the space alien cults, the new age space alien UFO cults who attack me.
[00:48:31.438 --> 00:48:33.599]  Look, I'm not attacking any of your groups.
[00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:35.980]  I'm not singling any group out.
[00:48:37.794 --> 00:48:57.121]  I am speaking out against the banks that are taking over our country, and that's why I am the number one target of the government, and the mainstream media, and George Soros foundations, and the White House enemies list, all on record, and the Nazis controlled by the feds, and the ADL, and the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:48:57.121 --> 00:48:59.342]  They all attack me.
[00:48:59.342 --> 00:49:02.083]  Why are they attacking Alex Jones?
[00:49:05.236 --> 00:49:09.399]  Because we're doing something right.
[00:49:09.399 --> 00:49:17.926]  We've got a good message, a true message, a clean message, a loving message, an honorable, innocent message.
[00:49:17.926 --> 00:49:26.874]  Because the establishment taps my phones, and they've assessed me, and they've got my psychological profile, and they know I'm a good person.
[00:49:26.874 --> 00:49:29.156]  And I'm for real.
[00:49:29.156 --> 00:49:33.920]  And they know I don't cheat people, and I don't lie about people, and I don't do dirty tricks, and I don't hurt people.
[00:49:34.767 --> 00:49:40.069]  And that's why the New World Order is scared to death of me.
[00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:45.271]  They are scared to death because I get up here and I teach people the power you have.
[00:49:45.271 --> 00:49:58.055]  And I show people how true activism at events and for Al Gore and for world leaders when they go to book signings, the power of taking over all their events and running them to ground peacefully, hounding them.
[00:49:58.835 --> 00:50:00.857]  And how we can take over our cities and counties.
[00:50:00.857 --> 00:50:03.459]  Now we can educate the police with oath keepers.
[00:50:03.459 --> 00:50:07.742]  And how we can reach out and shatter the division of the left-right paradigm.
[00:50:07.742 --> 00:50:13.967]  Folks, if people follow what I say and implement it and develop it and even improve on it, it's over!
[00:50:13.967 --> 00:50:15.448]  Game over for the New World Order!
[00:50:18.536 --> 00:50:39.588]  So remember, what I'm doing here is of the paramount importance because we are under attack from every angle and every side because our growth curve is straight up and the establishment knows that I am now becoming a true threat to them and I'll tell you right now, I've never been in greater danger of being set up, of being killed, of being destroyed.
[00:50:40.532 --> 00:50:41.012]  I don't know.
[00:51:00.754 --> 00:51:02.735]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:51:02.735 --> 00:51:08.098]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:09.699]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:18.104]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:05.401]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.401 --> 00:52:08.983]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:08.983 --> 00:52:14.147]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.147 --> 00:52:20.171]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.171 --> 00:52:22.413]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:22.913 --> 00:52:24.554]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:24.554 --> 00:52:25.714]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:25.714 --> 00:52:28.276]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:28.276 --> 00:52:30.197]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:30.197 --> 00:52:31.657]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[00:52:46.224 --> 00:52:49.107]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:46.051 --> 00:53:49.353]  Season's greetings and health and wellness from Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:12.195]  They don't want to see us unite.
[00:54:12.195 --> 00:54:18.180]  All they want us to do is keep on forcing and fighting.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:26.427]  They don't want to see us live together.
[00:54:26.427 --> 00:54:31.871]  All they want us to do is keep on killing one another.
[00:54:31.871 --> 00:54:32.952]  That's a prank.
[00:54:39.051 --> 00:54:40.813]  Okay, I only got to one phone call.
[00:54:40.813 --> 00:54:43.836]  I want to try to get to more of your calls, so please have your question or comment ready.
[00:54:43.836 --> 00:54:46.158]  I'm going to try to move on to get everybody on.
[00:54:46.158 --> 00:54:47.859]  Collin in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:54:47.859 --> 00:54:49.161]  Go ahead.
[00:54:49.161 --> 00:54:50.122]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:50.122 --> 00:54:56.267]  We're screening your film, Called the Republic, in Houston, and I was told that you're a radical terrorist.
[00:54:56.267 --> 00:54:56.648]  Really?
[00:54:56.648 --> 00:54:57.709]  Yeah.
[00:54:57.709 --> 00:55:02.033]  When I tried to rent various movie theaters, they asked me, okay, what's the film?
[00:55:03.137 --> 00:55:10.062]  And then they click on the website, you know, they go to fatherrepublic.com, and they're like, oh, Obama looks so menacing, this looks radical.
[00:55:10.062 --> 00:55:10.963]  What do you guys believe in?
[00:55:10.963 --> 00:55:23.852]  And I'm like, well... Oh yeah, in America, you're not allowed to talk bad about the president, it's the land of the slaves, yes, but you finally found a theater that would let you.
[00:55:23.852 --> 00:55:27.215]  Yeah, well, the Alamo Draft House, West Oak, they're patriots.
[00:55:27.662 --> 00:55:32.746]  But everyone else said I must be a terrorist too for trying to show a non-fiction documentary about America.
[00:55:32.746 --> 00:55:34.087]  No, listen, that's not American.
[00:55:34.087 --> 00:55:37.490]  Americans aren't supposed to have political views or show a film.
[00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:39.652]  I mean, man, you think this is a free country?
[00:55:39.652 --> 00:55:43.015]  You think our veterans fought and died so you'd have freedom?
[00:55:43.015 --> 00:55:46.157]  You're some kind of conspiracy terrorist, Colin.
[00:55:46.157 --> 00:55:48.179]  Yes, I must be because I care about the country.
[00:55:48.179 --> 00:55:50.941]  And you too, you're a bad terrorist.
[00:55:50.941 --> 00:55:55.185]  It's showing on Wednesday, November 18th in the Houston area, Alamo, West Oaks.
[00:55:55.666 --> 00:55:59.451]  Hopefully people can make it out and hopefully they're not afraid of people who call them terrorists.
[00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:03.712]  Yeah, I mean, the film calls for no violence.
[00:56:03.712 --> 00:56:05.533]  It shows Obama admitting world government.
[00:56:05.533 --> 00:56:07.855]  It shows Al Gore calling for world government.
[00:56:07.855 --> 00:56:12.958]  It shows congressional testimony and former federal regulators.
[00:56:12.958 --> 00:56:16.760]  We interviewed an economist and best-selling authors about the new world order.
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:20.262]  Oh my gosh, Americans, you're not allowed to do that.
[00:56:20.262 --> 00:56:22.864]  I mean, with the free speech zone.
[00:56:22.864 --> 00:56:25.926]  So they would call, they would say, I was a terrorist?
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:31.527]  They said we looked like we could be radical terrorists for trying to show this movie.
[00:56:31.527 --> 00:56:36.956]  And they said, oh well, terrorist groups try to rent out movie theaters in Los Angeles and show terrorist movies.
[00:56:36.956 --> 00:56:37.897]  We have to check in.
[00:56:37.897 --> 00:56:39.740]  We think this looks like terrorism.
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.762]  We can't do business with you.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:48.926]  And movie theaters are closing all across the country, and they refuse, my money's no good to them because I want to show a film about the Constitution in America.
[00:56:48.926 --> 00:56:50.347]  You can't do that.
[00:56:50.347 --> 00:56:52.709]  And that's why the Republic is falling.
[00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:58.513]  Because the entire Bill of Rights has been shot to pieces like somebody blasted it a hundred times with a 12-gauge shotgun.
[00:56:58.513 --> 00:57:02.677]  You ever seen a sign out in the country riddled with shotgun holes?
[00:57:02.677 --> 00:57:03.738]  That's the Constitution.
[00:57:04.378 --> 00:57:10.607]  And then how dare you try to show a film and how dare I make a film?
[00:57:10.607 --> 00:57:15.293]  I mean, again, folks, you must get Fall of the Republic on DVD.
[00:57:15.293 --> 00:57:16.995]  You must make copies of it.
[00:57:16.995 --> 00:57:18.718]  You've got to get it out to everyone.
[00:57:18.718 --> 00:57:20.460]  Show it at your local library.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:21.381]  Show it everywhere.
[00:57:22.162 --> 00:57:34.508]  And, you know, if I was you, I would write an article and post it on the web about the theaters and get quotes from these people saying it's terrorism because that will only cause thousands of other people to want to go find out what all the hubbub is about.
[00:57:34.508 --> 00:57:41.772]  See, we're the good people, we're the real Americans, we have our First Amendment, we have to exercise it or lose it, Colin.
[00:57:41.772 --> 00:57:44.733]  How many theaters said it might be terrorism?
[00:57:44.733 --> 00:57:45.313]  Four.
[00:57:45.313 --> 00:57:49.075]  But they own a monopoly on most of the movie theaters.
[00:57:49.075 --> 00:57:50.416]  A terrorist film?
[00:57:51.348 --> 00:57:52.989]  Yeah, radical.
[00:57:52.989 --> 00:57:54.711]  And, you know, it's something to do with terrorism.
[00:57:54.711 --> 00:57:59.034]  And Obama looks so menacing on the cover.
[00:57:59.034 --> 00:58:00.375]  He looks menacing?
[00:58:00.375 --> 00:58:02.057]  You can't have that.
[00:58:02.057 --> 00:58:03.158]  It's so scary.
[00:58:03.158 --> 00:58:12.365]  I mean, did you explain to them I'm a national radio host and that my documentary films have been written up all over the world?
[00:58:12.365 --> 00:58:13.266]  Yes, I did.
[00:58:13.266 --> 00:58:14.967]  You know, but they're not interested in that.
[00:58:14.967 --> 00:58:17.329]  They're scared of images and things they don't understand.
[00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:18.130]  And hype.
[00:58:19.059 --> 00:58:20.300]  Well, no.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:31.487]  Remember that it's now all over the news that the government is paying for messages to be implanted in children's TV shows, movies, adult television shows.
[00:58:31.487 --> 00:58:35.830]  Al Gore is all over mainline sitcoms pushing the global warming tax.
[00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:41.974]  That's okay to tell us the Earth's dying if we don't pay Al Gore money.
[00:58:41.974 --> 00:58:45.396]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.396 --> 00:58:47.458]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.892 --> 00:58:54.455]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.455 --> 00:58:55.355]  Number one.
[00:58:55.355 --> 00:58:58.778]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:58.778 --> 00:58:59.638]  Number two.
[00:58:59.638 --> 00:59:04.541]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:05.282]  It's true.
[00:59:05.282 --> 00:59:10.145]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.145 --> 00:59:10.985]  Number three.
[00:59:10.985 --> 00:59:14.568]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.568 --> 00:59:18.270]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:19.271]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.271 --> 00:59:22.013]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.013 --> 00:59:25.697]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.697 --> 00:59:26.498]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.498 --> 00:59:30.641]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.641 --> 00:59:35.406]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:35.686 --> 00:59:39.848]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:39.848 --> 00:59:41.649]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:41.649 --> 00:59:43.910]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:46.511]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.511 --> 00:59:55.375]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.375 --> 01:00:04.820]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.420]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.227 --> 01:00:15.594]  A subject I want to cover at the bottom of the hour is television propaganda.
[01:00:36.388 --> 01:00:38.389]  Number one, it's completely illegal.
[01:00:38.389 --> 01:00:54.641]  The General Accounting Office found six years ago with Bush, Obama has radically expanded it, and now they just admit that there are pro-global warming tax messages, anti-Second Amendment messages, anti-family messages, anti-in-the-Fed messages.
[01:00:54.641 --> 01:00:56.162]  Just pure propaganda.
[01:00:56.162 --> 01:01:03.227]  Every drama, every sitcom, almost every major television show that's on broadcast TV is government propaganda now.
[01:01:07.904 --> 01:01:11.486]  And I want to go over this because it's just incredible.
[01:01:11.486 --> 01:01:12.967]  Let's talk to Ian in Florida.
[01:01:12.967 --> 01:01:13.687]  Ian, you're on the air.
[01:01:13.687 --> 01:01:16.488]  Go ahead.
[01:01:16.488 --> 01:01:18.429]  Hey, buddy.
[01:01:18.429 --> 01:01:20.710]  I called you last Monday just to get the ball rolling.
[01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:27.674]  And later that night for the Al Gore protest here in Boca Raton, I joined about 14 meetup groups.
[01:01:27.674 --> 01:01:30.135]  And all in all, we had about 250 people there.
[01:01:30.135 --> 01:01:31.916]  I've got a great little mini report for you.
[01:01:33.373 --> 01:01:48.259]  We basically booed for two hours solid at an outdoor venue, and all of the major news reports that we got in, whether it be TV, radio, online, blogs, basically were probably edited by the editors of the people who wrote the story.
[01:01:49.199 --> 01:01:55.061]  Uh, and they said that there was about 1,000 people inside, or 2,000 people, or 800 people.
[01:01:55.061 --> 01:01:59.782]  There was maybe 250 people inside, and just about the same amount outside.
[01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:06.364]  What you do is you videotape that, which I'm sure you did, or somebody did, then you show the local newscast how they lied.
[01:02:06.364 --> 01:02:07.164]  That's fair use.
[01:02:07.964 --> 01:02:16.132]  And then you put it on YouTube, and everywhere this happens, you show everyone the lies, and then the mainstream media further implodes.
[01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.913]  But look, super job!
[01:02:17.913 --> 01:02:25.240]  You still got all over TV, all over radio, all over the newspapers, and it was pointed out in the Boca Raton newspaper.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.083]  In fact, I happen to have it right here in my stack.
[01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:29.984]  I'm trying to dig it out right now.
[01:02:29.984 --> 01:02:31.346]  It was admitted
[01:02:31.886 --> 01:02:34.408]  That there were at least 200 of you guys.
[01:02:34.408 --> 01:02:40.672]  It says Gore's presentation on climate change draws 800 as 200 protesters gather outside.
[01:02:40.672 --> 01:02:43.615]  And it points out that he is making money off of it.
[01:02:43.615 --> 01:02:44.835]  Then it says cap and trade.
[01:02:44.835 --> 01:02:45.656]  Don't be fooled.
[01:02:45.656 --> 01:02:47.818]  Al Gore will make billions.
[01:02:47.818 --> 01:02:52.761]  Read a sign carried by Alan Tudor who drove in from Tampa to attend Saturday's protest.
[01:02:52.761 --> 01:02:53.522]  Gore's favorite
[01:02:54.102 --> 01:02:57.865]  Green product, your money in his pocket, said another sign.
[01:02:57.865 --> 01:03:01.549]  And then it goes on to have Gore's people admit he's making money off of it.
[01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:03.611]  So, devastating job.
[01:03:03.611 --> 01:03:04.852]  I mean, you devastated them, sir.
[01:03:04.852 --> 01:03:11.438]  This is a bold testament to all the people who think they're little people out there and can't stand up to big people.
[01:03:11.438 --> 01:03:13.900]  We got major news coverage.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:17.283]  But now you've got to carry the ball the next step.
[01:03:17.283 --> 01:03:18.944]  You've got to get together with the meetups.
[01:03:19.864 --> 01:03:38.357]  Don't overdo it, don't overwork, just get it out fast and give it a provocative headline, media caught, you know, lying for Al Gore, and then show how they said 2,000 inside, or 800 depending on the report, and then show how you had more people than he did, and then say, busted!
[01:03:38.357 --> 01:03:41.879]  I mean, bust these people, man, hit them and hit them hard!
[01:03:41.879 --> 01:03:42.920]  We will do that.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.701]  Everybody can do what I've been doing.
[01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:45.822]  I can't do it all.
[01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.684]  You are absolutely kicking New World Order tail.
[01:03:48.684 --> 01:03:48.964]  Go ahead.
[01:03:49.898 --> 01:03:50.639]  We will do that.
[01:03:50.639 --> 01:03:56.683]  We're going to be editing our We Are Change Florida video with some nice anti-global warming music along with an article.
[01:03:56.683 --> 01:03:57.844]  We'll submit it to you guys.
[01:03:57.844 --> 01:04:00.586]  And thanks for putting us up there on one of the top articles.
[01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:01.026]  You bet.
[01:04:01.026 --> 01:04:02.548]  Carry the ball even further.
[01:04:02.548 --> 01:04:05.450]  As I've done trying to support We Are Change, I need your support.
[01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:10.153]  If you want it, everybody who's confronting Al Gore, send me the video with a letter saying I can use it.
[01:04:10.153 --> 01:04:15.677]  We're going to put it in Follow the Republic 2.
[01:04:15.677 --> 01:04:16.298]  How does that sound?
[01:04:17.196 --> 01:04:19.178]  Thank you to everybody who came out in support.
[01:04:19.178 --> 01:04:20.699]  We had Constitution Party there.
[01:04:20.699 --> 01:04:22.340]  We had the Oath Keepers there.
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:23.321]  We had Libertarians.
[01:04:23.321 --> 01:04:24.662]  We are changed.
[01:04:24.662 --> 01:04:32.809]  And, of course, the 9-12ers, but they had a solid, you know, goal to just put down cap and trade and nothing else, so it went well.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:33.741]  Well, stay there.
[01:04:33.741 --> 01:04:37.884]  I want to sit back, give you two or three minutes to give us a full report on what happened.
[01:04:37.884 --> 01:04:38.924]  What did the police do?
[01:04:38.924 --> 01:04:45.730]  See, when people have a G20 and 20,000 protesters show up in one spot, the police can attack you and shut you down.
[01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:50.013]  But when citizens start showing up everywhere, they can't stop the run.
[01:04:50.013 --> 01:04:54.997]  They can't stop us marching down the field, scoring points against the New World Order.
[01:04:54.997 --> 01:04:57.779]  You just made a major touchdown against the enemy.
[01:04:57.779 --> 01:04:59.020]  Let's line up and do it again.
[01:05:00.913 --> 01:05:06.496]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[01:05:21.363 --> 01:05:25.447]  I use TPR-20 for arthritis in my hand and it works great.
[01:05:25.447 --> 01:05:29.950]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.
[01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:39.098]  On TPR20info.com, you can read about the many uses of TPR-20, like arthritis, fibromyalgia, sports injuries, back pain, sore muscles, and much, much more.

[01:05:54.919 --> 01:05:55.640]  That's tpr20info.com.
[01:05:59.793 --> 01:06:07.542]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[01:06:07.542 --> 01:06:13.610]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:16.293]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:22.841]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:06:22.841 --> 01:06:26.925]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:06:26.925 --> 01:06:32.292]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:06:32.532 --> 01:06:34.614]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:06:34.614 --> 01:06:36.356]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:06:36.356 --> 01:06:38.899]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:06:38.899 --> 01:06:43.624]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:47.328]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:06:47.328 --> 01:06:50.471]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:52.353]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:52.353 --> 01:06:54.475]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:07:00.638 --> 01:07:04.662]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:04.662 --> 01:07:07.905]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:07.905 --> 01:07:12.689]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:12.689 --> 01:07:19.095]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.095 --> 01:07:21.337]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:21.857 --> 01:07:22.177]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:22.177 --> 01:07:22.678]  Bernanke?
[01:07:22.678 --> 01:07:23.478]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:23.478 --> 01:07:24.639]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:24.639 --> 01:07:26.880]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:40.768 --> 01:07:42.889]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:42.889 --> 01:07:48.050]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:48.050 --> 01:08:00.374]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:00.374 --> 01:08:05.795]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.795 --> 01:08:08.056]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:10.014 --> 01:08:20.923]  The top European Union Parliament member from Italy gave an impassioned speech last week.
[01:08:20.923 --> 01:08:22.305]  We would play it, but it's in Italian.
[01:08:22.305 --> 01:08:25.307]  We have subtitles up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:25.307 --> 01:08:33.915]  He gave a powerful speech pointing out that all three of the selected individuals
[01:08:34.841 --> 01:08:38.208]  Who they were choosing to be the head of the European Union.
[01:08:38.208 --> 01:08:40.352]  All three were Bilderberg Group members.
[01:08:40.352 --> 01:08:43.198]  And they did choose a Bilderberg Group member on Friday.
[01:08:43.198 --> 01:08:46.744]  We wrote stories about that on our news websites.
[01:08:49.778 --> 01:08:51.979]  Chuck Norris is talking about the New World Order.
[01:08:51.979 --> 01:09:02.326]  Even Dick Morris constantly when I hear him on radio or TV is admitting we're going into world government and Sean Hannity turns red on his own TV show when the Fox pundit admits the truth.
[01:09:02.326 --> 01:09:04.147]  I'm not saying Dick Morris is a good guy.
[01:09:04.147 --> 01:09:06.288]  Ron Paul is talking about the New World Order.
[01:09:06.288 --> 01:09:11.051]  More and more people are talking about it and so now the social
[01:09:13.294 --> 01:09:17.585]  Blind spot that has been implanted in people's psyche is being removed.
[01:09:17.585 --> 01:09:21.234]  It's now becoming socially kosher.
[01:09:21.234 --> 01:09:22.577]  Socially acceptable.
[01:09:23.697 --> 01:09:25.738]  You're not supposed to talk about politics or religion.
[01:09:25.738 --> 01:09:30.260]  America was all about politics and religion until a hundred years ago when they said, oh, it's not polite.
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:30.840]  Shut up.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.481]  Retreat into your houses.
[01:09:32.481 --> 01:09:34.302]  Don't get on the soapboxes anymore.
[01:09:34.302 --> 01:09:37.163]  Well, the people are learning how to get on the soapboxes.
[01:09:37.163 --> 01:09:42.446]  And the real fights are when 10, 20, 30, 40 people go out and confront politicians.
[01:09:42.446 --> 01:09:48.668]  I told you years ago that would grow into hundreds and then thousands and then into hundreds of thousands.
[01:09:48.668 --> 01:09:49.529]  Uncontrollable
[01:09:50.743 --> 01:09:56.465]  Information coming out, even if they shut the web off, they're not going to be able to shut the people off.
[01:09:56.465 --> 01:10:06.689]  Look at the power of you, the listeners of this show, posting the Obama Joker posters worldwide from Japan to England, from Mexico to the United States, from Canada to Thailand.
[01:10:08.783 --> 01:10:10.583]  All over TV internationally.
[01:10:10.583 --> 01:10:11.504]  All over radio.
[01:10:11.504 --> 01:10:12.684]  All over newspapers.
[01:10:12.684 --> 01:10:15.945]  And it got even bigger when the newspapers said, arrest Mr. Jones.
[01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:17.965]  Arrest whoever's putting these up.
[01:10:17.965 --> 01:10:19.286]  People said, well wait a minute.
[01:10:19.286 --> 01:10:22.226]  They're pulling down these signs, but not garage sale signs.
[01:10:22.226 --> 01:10:26.067]  And not pro-Obama signs.
[01:10:26.067 --> 01:10:27.488]  So it blew up in their face.
[01:10:27.488 --> 01:10:30.068]  They said, well wait, you were allowed to do this with Bush.
[01:10:30.068 --> 01:10:32.289]  Why not with Obama?
[01:10:32.289 --> 01:10:35.509]  So see, we make them show their hand of tyranny.
[01:10:35.509 --> 01:10:37.370]  We make them show us who they are.
[01:10:38.413 --> 01:10:46.458]  Now, Ian called in a week ago and he said, coming up this weekend, Al Gore is gonna be in Boca Raton, Florida.
[01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:55.864]  And you can go to his websites, Al Gore's websites, and find out where he's gonna be next.
[01:10:55.864 --> 01:11:02.067]  And spontaneously, through the meetups, through We Are Change, it's We Are Change that is first going out to all the events.
[01:11:02.067 --> 01:11:03.248]  It's just a name.
[01:11:03.248 --> 01:11:04.669]  It's a spontaneous activism.
[01:11:06.641 --> 01:11:13.846]  What one 19-year-old man did two and a half years ago, Luke Rudowsky, when he got kicked out of 9-11 Truth because he was going after the globalists.
[01:11:13.846 --> 01:11:15.887]  They wanted to control it in New York.
[01:11:15.887 --> 01:11:18.509]  And I said, Luke, we're going to support you.
[01:11:18.509 --> 01:11:19.330]  Don't drop out.
[01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:19.810]  Don't quit.
[01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:20.711]  He said, never.
[01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:22.272]  I said, take action.
[01:11:22.272 --> 01:11:23.433]  Start an organization.
[01:11:23.433 --> 01:11:24.854]  Keep confronting the politicians.
[01:11:24.854 --> 01:11:27.696]  He wanted to have 9-11 Truth do that in New York.
[01:11:27.696 --> 01:11:29.217]  And I'm not saying they were bad in New York.
[01:11:29.217 --> 01:11:30.518]  They just wanted to stay on one mission.
[01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:32.951]  And now it's spread everywhere.
[01:11:32.951 --> 01:11:34.812]  And now there's Second Amendment groups.
[01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:36.433]  Now there's hundreds of other groups.
[01:11:36.433 --> 01:11:44.859]  The Sons of Liberty is forming.
[01:11:44.859 --> 01:11:45.760]  Call it whatever you want.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.321]  It's the Sons and Daughters of Liberty.
[01:11:47.321 --> 01:11:48.542]  It's the People of Liberty.
[01:11:48.542 --> 01:11:50.643]  It's the Children of Liberty.
[01:11:50.643 --> 01:11:52.625]  It's rising.
[01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:58.249]  And so all over Florida TV, and on national television, and in scores of newspapers,
[01:12:00.236 --> 01:12:03.498]  They took over, 250 is what Ian is saying.
[01:12:03.498 --> 01:12:05.260]  I've seen photos and videos.
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.801]  It looks like over 200.
[01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:10.523]  I remember the event said it only had 300 tickets.
[01:12:10.523 --> 01:12:13.626]  So how is the media reporting?
[01:12:13.626 --> 01:12:16.748]  By the way, it says they wouldn't let the media in the event.
[01:12:16.748 --> 01:12:17.929]  How is the media reporting 2,000, 1,800?
[01:12:17.929 --> 01:12:19.870]  That's the different news articles I have.
[01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:20.090]  2,800, what?
[01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:20.451]  Which is it?
[01:12:27.805 --> 01:12:34.828]  So they didn't want it to be in the news that more people were outside against him than were inside for him.
[01:12:34.828 --> 01:12:39.629]  And everywhere he goes, this is now catching fire, like I told you six months ago with the Tea Parties.
[01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:41.330]  And I said, watch, they're gonna try to co-opt him.
[01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:43.110]  And they've tried, but it's still not working.
[01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:46.492]  And notice these politicians now can't go anywhere.
[01:12:46.492 --> 01:12:52.114]  And they can't sell the public that, oh, you want cap and trade when everybody comes out and protest it.
[01:12:52.114 --> 01:12:54.755]  It's pointless to have one big demonstration in Washington.
[01:12:54.755 --> 01:12:55.615]  The media can ignore that.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:01.924]  But they can't send in their operatives to shut down coverage in every town and every city yet.
[01:13:01.924 --> 01:13:03.425]  They don't have complete control.
[01:13:03.425 --> 01:13:06.007]  Your local reporters aren't all operatives.
[01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:07.849]  That's only at the top national level.
[01:13:12.093 --> 01:13:15.175]  They cannot stop you if you take action.
[01:13:15.175 --> 01:13:17.336]  They cannot stop you.
[01:13:17.336 --> 01:13:25.380]  I've learned with the State House and the City Council and County Commissioners, when I choose to fight something myself locally, we defeat them every time.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.122]  I just can't fight all of them.
[01:13:28.122 --> 01:13:29.883]  You can.
[01:13:29.883 --> 01:13:31.804]  You are the leaders.
[01:13:31.804 --> 01:13:33.625]  You have the power.
[01:13:33.625 --> 01:13:35.366]  We are a headless leviathan.
[01:13:36.547 --> 01:13:38.508]  Because we have 10 million heads.
[01:13:38.508 --> 01:13:42.551]  We cannot be stopped if you realize you can't be stopped.
[01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:45.673]  Nothing can stop you if you take action.
[01:13:45.673 --> 01:13:49.836]  Ian in Florida, give us a full report from Florida.
[01:13:49.836 --> 01:13:50.876]  You called into the show.
[01:13:50.876 --> 01:13:53.598]  We posted a video on the Alex Jones Channel.
[01:13:53.598 --> 01:13:55.860]  I appreciate all the kind emails I've gotten from the attendees.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:59.982]  That really helped it get supercharged so there wouldn't just be 30 or 40.
[01:13:59.982 --> 01:14:03.245]  Next time Al Gore shows up, I think he's in Arizona next, isn't he?
[01:14:03.245 --> 01:14:05.006]  We need to pull up, find out where he's at.
[01:14:05.646 --> 01:14:11.887]  And then have 1,000 show up, then it'll be 10,000, and then it's over for that slime bag.
[01:14:11.887 --> 01:14:15.868]  It is that easy to defeat.
[01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:19.349]  That liar would get up and say, I'm not making any money off this just three years ago.
[01:14:19.349 --> 01:14:20.249]  Now he has to admit it.
[01:14:20.249 --> 01:14:22.349]  He would say polar bears couldn't swim three years ago.
[01:14:22.349 --> 01:14:24.550]  Now he has to admit they can swim.
[01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:27.210]  He was saying the ice caps had completely melted three years ago.
[01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:29.771]  Now he has to admit they get bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer.
[01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:36.897]  Now he's having to admit 30,000 plus top scientists are saying it's all a fraud.
[01:14:36.897 --> 01:14:45.144]  Now they're talking about pulling it off the table like they did the different treaties for Europe, the Lisbon, and bringing it back.
[01:14:47.455 --> 01:14:50.237]  Because they know our critical mass is building against them.
[01:14:50.237 --> 01:14:53.899]  They want to retire from the field, or at least they're putting out that signal.
[01:14:53.899 --> 01:14:55.320]  You gotta watch them.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.642]  When they start running, you intensify firepower.
[01:14:58.642 --> 01:14:59.662]  You route the enemy.
[01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:02.464]  You drive them into their bases in the info war.
[01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:04.345]  You discredit them and smash them.
[01:15:04.345 --> 01:15:06.286]  Okay, Ian, go ahead from Florida.
[01:15:06.286 --> 01:15:07.867]  Give us a report.
[01:15:07.867 --> 01:15:08.467]  Oh, great.
[01:15:08.467 --> 01:15:14.831]  Everything you're saying is so correct, and I have to give you and Luke and so many other great patriots props for the inspiration.
[01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:17.279]  We are led by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:15:27.901 --> 01:15:31.664]  But yes, we are leaderless in that we don't have some central group running us.
[01:15:31.664 --> 01:15:38.049]  The globalists always have fake patriots out saying we've got to centralize, we've got to go under someone's command.
[01:15:38.049 --> 01:15:39.050]  No!
[01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:44.534]  We're under the command of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
[01:15:44.534 --> 01:15:45.275]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:15:46.038 --> 01:15:46.778]  No, that's great.
[01:15:46.778 --> 01:15:56.744]  And basically, I initiated so much chatter on Monday night on the internet that by Friday, some online newspapers started writing articles about an upcoming protest.
[01:15:56.744 --> 01:16:06.990]  So, I got an email and a phone call Friday morning from the captain of the Boca Raton Police, Captain Mindick, and he basically just wanted to know exactly what we had planned, because I did
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:08.060]  I'm good.
[01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:28.136]  And again, let me stop you before I forget.
[01:16:28.136 --> 01:16:34.142]  Five years ago, they would have just said no protest allowed, but they've lost so many suits because of people fighting back.
[01:16:34.142 --> 01:16:39.066]  The police are now behaving themselves a little bit better and not disgracing their uniforms.
[01:16:39.066 --> 01:16:40.207]  So that's good.
[01:16:40.207 --> 01:16:43.470]  Good that the police didn't try to set fire to the flag.
[01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:44.151]  Go ahead.
[01:16:44.151 --> 01:16:44.591]  Absolutely.
[01:16:44.591 --> 01:16:47.013]  And we live in a bit of a bubble here, and it was one of those...
[01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:52.635]  You know, nice development as all the classy, trendy restaurants with a big amphitheater at the end.
[01:16:52.635 --> 01:16:58.060]  So they gave us the whole park in the middle, the whole median, and they did line the streets.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:08.231]  A good 20, 30 cops were in front of us, a bunch of private security all around the ground, and we booed so loud that we know every attendee in there had to listen very, very
[01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:11.827]  The newspaper was inside.
[01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:14.809]  They said the TV was forced to turn their cameras off.
[01:17:14.809 --> 01:17:24.735]  The newspaper does report that you were drowning out even that swollen blood tick, Al Gore's disgusting voice.
[01:17:24.735 --> 01:17:33.080]  And one quick thing I want to point out here, because this is the psychology that they do in this Orwellian doublespeak reality that we've come into living in here.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.942]  Basically, I was really tuning my ears to hear what he was going to say about us.
[01:17:37.478 --> 01:17:40.360]  And it came toward the end after he made his point.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:58.172]  He basically said, he started to ramble on, he goes, so not only is this a moral issue or an ethical obligation of our times, it is a spiritual, and hold on Alex, let me explain this, it is a spiritual issue, and that's why those people outside are doing what they're doing.
[01:17:58.172 --> 01:18:02.655]  And I got it later that night, he was saying, we're the non-believers, attack them.
[01:18:03.663 --> 01:18:08.066]  Yes, he's saying you're a heretic, you're a devil, you've got to be burned at the stake.
[01:18:08.066 --> 01:18:11.088]  And again, Al Gore didn't invent this religious angle.
[01:18:11.088 --> 01:18:14.290]  Look at the Newsweek headline, An Eco-Prophet Gets Real.
[01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:14.911]  The U.N.
[01:18:14.911 --> 01:18:23.597]  states in the 1996 Biological Diversity Assessment that they're going to establish a World Gaia Worship Religion.
[01:18:23.597 --> 01:18:24.357]  Yep, yep.
[01:18:24.357 --> 01:18:26.679]  And we know that's coming out in his new movie.
[01:18:26.679 --> 01:18:27.960]  He's going to be coming out with that.
[01:18:29.108 --> 01:18:49.159]  Obviously, you know, with no science, that's the only way they can go, is get everybody, like you say, that's so much into the anti-establishment religions, like the New Age type of movement, and just convert all of them over into this save-the-planet, non-scientific argument, where it's basically ideology covering up climatology.
[01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:51.660]  And we, you and I, Alex, and all of us out there,
[01:18:52.139 --> 01:18:53.720]  We're the true environmentalists.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.665]  We understand who's really polluting the environment to create this illusion that we need this change.
[01:18:58.665 --> 01:19:01.227]  It's the very people funding this change.
[01:19:01.227 --> 01:19:08.853]  Yes, it's a smoke screen to block out genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, all the rest of it, and make it all about taxing carbon.
[01:19:08.853 --> 01:19:15.639]  On the cover of Newsweek, it shows a green apple above his head, the thinking man's thinking man, Al Gore's new plan for the planet.
[01:19:15.639 --> 01:19:16.300]  That apple
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.703]  Was grown and developed by its parent tree from carbon dioxide.
[01:19:21.703 --> 01:19:24.125]  See, it's all a sick joke in our face.
[01:19:24.125 --> 01:19:25.686]  Now, how were you hearing his speech?
[01:19:25.686 --> 01:19:27.547]  Was it on speakers?
[01:19:27.547 --> 01:19:29.248]  Yeah, this is one of the only venues.
[01:19:29.248 --> 01:19:35.472]  I mean, he must have, he's a real expert because he kept going and going and I mean, I doubt he could hear his own words.
[01:19:35.472 --> 01:19:40.475]  It was an outdoor amphitheater, so our voices literally echoed off the amphitheater.
[01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:43.357]  Do you have the audio of him saying it's a new religion?
[01:19:44.173 --> 01:19:44.834]  I hope we do.
[01:19:44.834 --> 01:19:46.417]  We're pulling everybody's audio.
[01:19:46.417 --> 01:19:51.585]  We're trying to edit everything up, and we're going to get it off to you throughout the week here, everything we have, all the pictures.
[01:19:51.585 --> 01:19:52.546]  And we'll do our best.
[01:19:52.546 --> 01:19:54.870]  If not, I will just quote it in an article.
[01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:55.731]  Good.
[01:19:55.731 --> 01:19:57.454]  Listen, Ian, God bless you.
[01:19:57.454 --> 01:19:58.596]  Incredible job.

[01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:11.931]  But what about food insurance?

[01:24:07.391 --> 01:24:09.333]  Big news blitz coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:12.567]  We've got a very special guest in the third hour today.
[01:24:12.567 --> 01:24:15.529]  I'll tell you about that a little bit later.
[01:24:15.529 --> 01:24:19.632]  Let's talk to Delilah in Ohio.
[01:24:19.632 --> 01:24:21.254]  Delilah, welcome.
[01:24:21.254 --> 01:24:21.954]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:24:21.954 --> 01:24:24.056]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:24:24.056 --> 01:24:31.241]  I just wanted to mention very quickly the end of FedRally coming up this weekend.
[01:24:31.241 --> 01:24:37.186]  And we're having, I wasn't sure if you were familiar with it or not, we're having Jim Traficant as our guest.
[01:24:37.865 --> 01:24:40.507]  In the Cleveland, Ohio, End of Fed Rally.
[01:24:40.507 --> 01:24:41.748]  Beautiful!
[01:24:41.748 --> 01:24:44.410]  So, I'm really looking forward to that.
[01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:51.095]  There's going to be quite a few people attending the End of Fed Rally, so I'm really excited about that.
[01:24:51.095 --> 01:25:04.665]  One other thing I wanted to share with you very quickly was this past Sunday, yesterday, just before 10 o'clock in the morning, I had the TV on and clicking the channels and on CNN,
[01:25:05.768 --> 01:25:18.293]  Just before 10 Eastern Standard Time, there was a clip where they were talking about skull and bones and the Bush family and involved with Geronimo Skull and
[01:25:20.632 --> 01:25:32.897]  Yeah, the great-great-grandson of Geronimo sued Prescott Bush when he was a college student, went and did a grave robbery as a Skull and Bones initiation.
[01:25:32.897 --> 01:25:33.898]  They rob graves.
[01:25:33.898 --> 01:25:35.238]  You can't make this stuff up, folks.
[01:25:35.238 --> 01:25:37.179]  This is like ABC News.
[01:25:37.179 --> 01:25:42.782]  And they admittedly have his skull, and the federal court said, the elite can keep your skull.
[01:25:42.782 --> 01:25:47.544]  So the Bushes are allowed to steal body parts.
[01:25:47.544 --> 01:25:48.384]  Sickening, isn't it?
[01:25:49.755 --> 01:25:52.197]  Look, I mean, how about they dig up your great granddaddy?
[01:25:52.197 --> 01:25:56.440]  I mean, it's just, they do whatever they want.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:02.124]  What was shocking was the fact that it was on CNN, which I call Controlled News Network.
[01:26:02.124 --> 01:26:04.425]  But see, that's part of throwing it in your face.
[01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:06.547]  Look, we'll grave rob you if we want.
[01:26:06.547 --> 01:26:09.229]  We own you.
[01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:10.590]  So CNN reported that, huh?
[01:26:11.328 --> 01:26:23.752]  Yes, it was like five... Listen, ten years ago I would get on talk radio and talk about Skull and Bones and have national radio say I was insane and it didn't exist.
[01:26:23.752 --> 01:26:27.114]  Well, just wanted to say, keep up the good work.
[01:26:27.114 --> 01:26:33.756]  Passing out DVDs at the end of Fed Rally and telling everybody I can about Fall of the Republic.
[01:26:34.608 --> 01:26:35.869]  Awesome documentary.
[01:26:35.869 --> 01:26:44.858]  It just really makes people understand that the Federal Reserve is the enemy and they're the ones causing all the problems in the economy in the first place.
[01:26:44.858 --> 01:26:49.142]  So, it's just, I just have to tell everybody out there to watch it.
[01:26:49.142 --> 01:26:50.763]  It is just mind-blowing.
[01:26:50.763 --> 01:26:52.505]  It's very simplistic.
[01:26:52.505 --> 01:26:53.866]  You don't have to have a PhD.
[01:26:53.866 --> 01:26:54.827]  But it's evil!
[01:26:54.827 --> 01:26:58.230]  We can't show it in movie theaters because it's terrorist!
[01:26:58.230 --> 01:27:00.112]  Oh, Delilah, good to hear from you.
[01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.356]  Let's talk to Stephen in Texas.
[01:27:03.356 --> 01:27:05.317]  You're on the air, Steve.
[01:27:05.317 --> 01:27:08.518]  Yeah, good afternoon, fellow terrorist conspirator.
[01:27:08.518 --> 01:27:20.841]  You know, Alex, I told Jason months ago that we really need to start calling you guys Al-Qaeda Jones and Jason Bin Laden, you know, according to the media.
[01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:22.502]  That's the way you guys should be referred to.
[01:27:22.502 --> 01:27:26.623]  And you know, I'm being sarcastic because I'm totally... Yeah, how dare us not want the government running everything.
[01:27:26.623 --> 01:27:26.963]  We're able.
[01:27:27.719 --> 01:27:28.540]  Right.
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.261]  I had three quick points I wanted to make.
[01:27:30.261 --> 01:27:38.486]  First of all, you had a lady calling your show yesterday talking about a friend or relative of hers, something about childbirth and C-sections and all that.
[01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:44.150]  And as a father of seven kids, I just wanted to put advice out there to people in this area of childbirth.
[01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:45.871]  Avoid hospitals.
[01:27:45.871 --> 01:27:47.652]  Hospitals are for sick people.
[01:27:49.372 --> 01:28:07.337]  Well, hospitals, doctors will tell you, are just full of bad bugs, viruses, bacteria, and they're full of the worst drug-resistant stuff that can't make it out of the hospital, but that lives in the hospital, lives in the vents, lives in the rooms.
[01:28:07.337 --> 01:28:12.699]  And I don't know how many people, I've known so many people who are healthy, who go in for a hernia operation,
[01:28:13.579 --> 01:28:20.142]  Or go in for a nail through their foot, or go in for a nasal surgery, who just don't come out from the infection that kills them.
[01:28:20.142 --> 01:28:21.302]  Good to hear from you, Steve.
[01:28:21.302 --> 01:28:24.824]  Jason in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:28:24.824 --> 01:28:25.324]  Good day, sir.
[01:28:25.324 --> 01:28:26.245]  It's an honor.
[01:28:26.245 --> 01:28:28.586]  Hey, buddy.
[01:28:28.586 --> 01:28:37.189]  Reason for my call, basically I see a lot of this stuff from up here, so I have this vantage point of what's going to happen in Canada after seeing everything that's happening in the United States.
[01:28:39.266 --> 01:28:50.148]  I hear things on our news like our Prime Minister Stephen Harper says things like, after the economic downfall, Canada is going to be stronger and have a greater foot presence in the world.
[01:28:50.148 --> 01:28:59.650]  Now, after watching Fall of the Republic, there was the point between brands where you have Coke, Pepsi, Burger King, and McDonald's.
[01:28:59.650 --> 01:29:07.931]  It got me to thinking if it's possible that Canada might be used as a second brand because, I mean, we haven't had terrorist events up here.
[01:29:08.405 --> 01:29:10.787]  Although they've tried to perpetuate them within the news.
[01:29:10.787 --> 01:29:13.228]  Canada is run by the exact same system.
[01:29:13.228 --> 01:29:15.850]  Everything that happens to you is going to happen to us and vice versa.
[01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:19.812]  It's the same management group running it all.
[01:29:19.812 --> 01:29:21.974]  I totally believe that.
[01:29:21.974 --> 01:29:29.178]  China is going to be the new model, as Obama has said, talking down America.
[01:29:29.178 --> 01:29:31.460]  Anything else from Canada there, Jason?
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:34.802]  Do you believe anything is going to happen at the Olympics?
[01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:36.283]  I mean, like I said, nothing's happening.
[01:29:37.156 --> 01:29:40.519]  No, they've announced martial law for the Olympics.
[01:29:40.519 --> 01:29:44.021]  It's just any excuse to train you that troops are going to be on the street.
[01:29:44.021 --> 01:29:47.083]  I don't know if the Globalists are going to stage an event.
[01:29:47.083 --> 01:29:50.766]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:29:50.766 --> 01:29:52.167]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.167 --> 01:29:54.689]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:57.371]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.373 --> 01:30:09.517]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:30:09.517 --> 01:30:12.878]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:30:12.878 --> 01:30:18.741]  Instead, use Vitamin C-D and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife, for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:30:18.741 --> 01:30:23.523]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:30:23.523 --> 01:30:25.864]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:30:26.084 --> 01:30:26.484]  Thank you.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:48.685]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[01:30:48.685 --> 01:30:50.888]  That's O-X-Y Silver dot net.
[01:30:50.888 --> 01:30:55.915]  Or call about OxySilver, ZO Life, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:30:55.915 --> 01:30:57.417]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:30:57.417 --> 01:30:57.878]  Do it now.
[01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:04.091]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:09.416]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.416 --> 01:31:11.477]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.477 --> 01:31:16.481]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.481 --> 01:31:17.382]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.642 --> 01:31:18.763]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.763 --> 01:31:20.644]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.644 --> 01:31:21.725]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.725 --> 01:31:23.926]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.926 --> 01:31:25.267]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.267 --> 01:31:26.788]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.788 --> 01:31:32.072]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.072 --> 01:31:35.654]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.654 --> 01:31:39.117]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.457 --> 01:31:40.678]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.678 --> 01:31:41.599]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.599 --> 01:31:42.700]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:43.621]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:44.721]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.721 --> 01:31:47.764]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.764 --> 01:31:49.545]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.545 --> 01:31:50.466]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:07.118]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:07.118 --> 01:32:09.199]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:32:09.199 --> 01:32:11.440]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.101]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:32:13.101 --> 01:32:17.563]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:32:17.563 --> 01:32:20.144]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:32:47.672 --> 01:32:47.932]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:47.932 --> 01:32:49.593]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:33:22.501 --> 01:33:35.124]  We've got Damon Vickers, a top market pundit who's openly coming out and stating that world government is taking over the planet and the end of the dollar.
[01:33:35.124 --> 01:33:38.585]  He's on with us coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:40.424 --> 01:33:42.605]  Look forward to that.
[01:33:42.605 --> 01:33:51.370]  He's an analyst on Bloomberg, Fox Business, CNBC, BNN Canada, Japan Public Television, and Today Show.
[01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:53.951]  And we look forward to having him on with us next hour.
[01:33:53.951 --> 01:33:59.734]  I thought I'd play this clip now just to give you a little taste of what we're going to be getting into.
[01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:04.176]  This is Damon Vickers last week on CNBC.
[01:34:04.176 --> 01:34:08.158]  And more pundits are coming out and saying what he and others are saying.
[01:34:08.158 --> 01:34:09.639]  So it's becoming mainstream.
[01:34:10.472 --> 01:34:12.112]  Then we're going into a global government.
[01:34:12.112 --> 01:34:12.572]  Here it is.
[01:34:12.572 --> 01:34:20.394]  We're back with Damon Vickers, Chief Investment Officer, Nine Points Capital Partners, staying with us live out of Seattle, Washington.
[01:34:20.394 --> 01:34:27.375]  Damon, you guys are a hedge fund, and what you guys basically do is you try and catch breaks to either the up or downside.
[01:34:27.375 --> 01:34:36.037]  Apparently with oil, also with gold, you've done the timing pretty right, got it just as it started to oil up past 75, gold past 1,000.
[01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:37.617]  Are you going to sit on those positions then?
[01:34:39.466 --> 01:34:44.528]  Yeah, for sure!
[01:34:44.528 --> 01:35:04.616]  You can think a lot about it, and you can one day have all these vacillations psychologically, but this is the time to play ping-pong, to get involved in model-making or something ridiculous.
[01:35:04.616 --> 01:35:06.197]  This is the time where you make money.
[01:35:06.697 --> 01:35:09.759]  Where the trend develops, and so there's really not a lot to do with it.
[01:35:09.759 --> 01:35:15.881]  I mean oil looks higher, gold looks higher, currencies look weaker, all for the reasons that we talked about before.
[01:35:15.881 --> 01:35:18.823]  I mean, you've got huge wage disparities.
[01:35:18.823 --> 01:35:22.184]  I don't know how that inevitably resolves itself.
[01:35:22.184 --> 01:35:26.666]  It may resolve itself in some type of a global currency crisis.
[01:35:26.666 --> 01:35:34.670]  And then if the global currency crisis unfolds, then inevitably you get, I guess, an alignment under a global world government.
[01:35:36.031 --> 01:35:41.777]  A new global currency and a new world order.
[01:35:41.777 --> 01:35:44.540]  So, we may be moving towards that.
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:48.044]  Talk to us a little bit more about this currency crisis you see erupting.
[01:35:48.044 --> 01:35:50.227]  What does that assume about what's going to happen to the dollar?
[01:35:52.890 --> 01:35:57.915]  Well, it assumes that the dollar will utterly get destroyed and become virtually worthless.
[01:35:57.915 --> 01:36:01.758]  You know, we have a combined... Well, I mean, here's what we know.
[01:36:01.758 --> 01:36:12.367]  We know that if you can produce something, that this game that we have going on in the United States and on a planetary basis cannot perpetuate itself forever.
[01:36:12.367 --> 01:36:15.090]  We've got a $65 trillion negative net worth
[01:36:15.726 --> 01:36:23.832]  We cannot possibly meet with our health care costs and our indulgent society, which we have in the United States.
[01:36:23.832 --> 01:36:30.557]  We can't put that against the unit labor cost of a China that can produce something at $1 an hour versus $24 an hour with health benefits.
[01:36:33.559 --> 01:36:34.900]  He's with us next hour.
[01:37:01.496 --> 01:37:07.043]  Good job on the producers getting him on by the way.
[01:37:07.043 --> 01:37:08.144]  Let's talk Turkey.
[01:37:08.144 --> 01:37:11.388]  Let's talk about what's really going on here.
[01:37:11.388 --> 01:37:14.472]  More than anything, the Green Revolution
[01:37:16.403 --> 01:37:37.561]  Is about distracting the population's legitimate concern for real environmental problems like overfishing, cross-species genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, to distract public attention away from real problems the globalists are causing, predominantly, often to allowing them to tax carbon dioxide and other life-giving gases.
[01:37:39.107 --> 01:37:40.848]  They're part of our atmosphere.
[01:37:40.848 --> 01:37:46.771]  Every major study shows we're actually at a very low point for carbon dioxide in the last 200,000 years.
[01:37:46.771 --> 01:37:50.553]  Plants grow faster, live longer, are healthier, put off more oxygen.
[01:37:50.553 --> 01:37:53.815]  We're at a low oxygen point, one of the lowest levels ever recorded.
[01:37:53.815 --> 01:37:57.077]  They go back to ice samples 200 plus thousand years old.
[01:37:57.077 --> 01:38:01.259]  Oxygen has been as much as twice as prevalent in the atmosphere.
[01:38:01.259 --> 01:38:02.340]  Carbon dioxide 14 times higher.
[01:38:04.241 --> 01:38:06.362]  Humans live longer, are healthier.
[01:38:06.362 --> 01:38:15.687]  They've done long-term tests on rodents in higher oxygen controlled environments where they live their lives out in higher oxygen.
[01:38:15.687 --> 01:38:18.269]  They live longer, have less disease.
[01:38:18.269 --> 01:38:21.891]  The Earth is low on oxygen.
[01:38:21.891 --> 01:38:28.274]  We need more.
[01:38:28.274 --> 01:38:31.856]  We're on a planetoid flying through space.
[01:38:33.544 --> 01:38:38.326]  Think of the atmosphere as the skin on an apple.
[01:38:38.326 --> 01:38:44.368]  It's thinner than the skin of an apple, per capita, in a side-by-side comparison.
[01:38:44.368 --> 01:38:48.449]  The atmosphere is thinner than the skin of an apple.
[01:38:48.449 --> 01:38:53.891]  We are these little creatures that live in these little valleys on the surface of the planet where there's oxygen.
[01:38:53.891 --> 01:38:56.792]  When we go up in the mountains, we have trouble breathing!
[01:38:58.325 --> 01:39:04.089]  You go up 12,000 feet, most people start getting irritable, having nightmares, getting exhausted.
[01:39:04.089 --> 01:39:09.393]  You go up to 15, 16, 17,000 feet, most people get altitude sickness and will die.
[01:39:09.393 --> 01:39:18.178]  We live in this very thin little biosphere and plants breathe carbon dioxide and we breathe oxygen.
[01:39:18.178 --> 01:39:21.521]  Look, you're saying, what does this have to do with world government?
[01:39:21.521 --> 01:39:24.303]  The globalists control the world's fiat currencies.
[01:39:25.188 --> 01:39:32.580]  They use the Imperial US and British military to enforce that nations accept the private takeover of the central banks of their nations.
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:35.905]  If you don't, you get overthrown.
[01:39:35.905 --> 01:39:36.767]  They took over here in 1913.
[01:39:36.767 --> 01:39:37.007]  They are
[01:39:41.024 --> 01:39:45.209]  In the final phase now of using up the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[01:39:45.209 --> 01:39:58.343]  For the last 50 plus years of the dollar being the world currency, the globalists have used it to buy up shipping ports, roads, mines, governments, media, the private group of families that own the issuance of currency and credit.
[01:39:58.343 --> 01:39:58.964]  They own it all.
[01:40:00.595 --> 01:40:02.336]  They own all the big assets.
[01:40:02.336 --> 01:40:05.498]  Now they want your house, your farm, your ranch, your very livelihood.
[01:40:05.498 --> 01:40:08.600]  So they admit through globalism, they've de-industrialized the West.
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.822]  They've moved it to China that they've made a deal with, David Rockefeller, 1973.
[01:40:12.822 --> 01:40:18.706]  Sent George W. Bush, CIA director over there, to be ambassador to China.
[01:40:18.706 --> 01:40:21.047]  They formed this agreement, this deal.
[01:40:21.047 --> 01:40:23.909]  Now the President Obama's bad-mouthing the U.S.
[01:40:23.909 --> 01:40:25.670]  saying we're not good for industry and business.
[01:40:25.670 --> 01:40:27.230]  China's the place to move.
[01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:28.271]  I played that clip earlier.
[01:40:28.271 --> 01:40:29.372]  In fact, cue that back up again.
[01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:31.671]  The Obama clip.
[01:40:31.671 --> 01:40:33.872]  Thank you.
[01:40:33.872 --> 01:40:35.974]  He's been giving this speech for at least a year and a half.
[01:40:35.974 --> 01:40:38.075]  This clip's from the campaign trail that's coming up.
[01:40:38.075 --> 01:40:44.239]  I heard him say it again yesterday in China.
[01:40:44.239 --> 01:40:46.400]  They've moved all their assets offshore.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.822]  Now they want to implode the economy to get what's left.
[01:40:48.822 --> 01:40:54.226]  That's why they've staged terror attacks as the smoke screen to put militarized police and military
[01:40:55.203 --> 01:40:59.985]  on the streets and start the spying on the citizens and the tracking and tracing electronically.
[01:40:59.985 --> 01:41:11.289]  Now they're bringing in a world ID card that'll be a national ID card in subdivisions that everything you buy, sell, and do in the name of carbon credits and national sales tax will be registered on.
[01:41:11.289 --> 01:41:14.350]  You won't be able to use cash unless you swipe the card.
[01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:17.291]  It will be accessed with a thumbprint and a digital face scan.
[01:41:17.291 --> 01:41:19.692]  This was already UN treaty nine years ago.
[01:41:20.666 --> 01:41:22.587]  Now you see it all being announced.
[01:41:22.587 --> 01:41:26.448]  Oh, California, you're going to have a card to buy and sell with your carbon credits.
[01:41:26.448 --> 01:41:27.449]  Oregon, New York.
[01:41:27.449 --> 01:41:29.089]  Oh, England.
[01:41:29.089 --> 01:41:32.650]  Oh, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Japan.
[01:41:32.650 --> 01:41:33.811]  It's global government.
[01:41:33.811 --> 01:41:36.552]  They're going to bypass cashless society completely.
[01:41:36.552 --> 01:41:39.373]  There's not going to be any new global currency.
[01:41:39.373 --> 01:41:46.656]  You're going to have regional currencies run by them that still have a local look, but it's all standardized and set by the New World Order.
[01:41:46.656 --> 01:41:47.456]  This is all stated.
[01:41:49.028 --> 01:41:59.658]  And you can go to any ATM or machine, it'll kick out the local creds for your district, because they want to track where that money's going, and your name's going to be attached in the history of that money off its digital stripe.
[01:42:04.062 --> 01:42:12.847]  And they can fully control the economy, shut down the black market, because the globalists want to bankrupt you and drive you onto welfare and government institutionalization.
[01:42:12.847 --> 01:42:14.248]  They want you dependent.
[01:42:14.248 --> 01:42:18.251]  But they know that bringing in this system is going to create a giant black market.
[01:42:18.251 --> 01:42:23.774]  You engage in paying your neighbor in barter, you're going to jail.
[01:42:23.774 --> 01:42:31.299]  You have a bazaar, or you have a flea market, or you have a sale, a garage sale, you're going to jail.
[01:42:31.299 --> 01:42:32.780]  You try to sell plants.
[01:42:34.312 --> 01:42:37.613]  Christmas trees on the side of the road, firewood.
[01:42:37.613 --> 01:42:42.615]  Already in the European Union, you go to jail in many areas.
[01:42:42.615 --> 01:42:48.616]  In Germany, to cut a tree on your property, you've got to get a special license for each tree and get it approved.
[01:42:48.616 --> 01:42:49.917]  That's going worldwide.
[01:42:49.917 --> 01:42:51.477]  You want to be a feudal serf?
[01:42:51.477 --> 01:42:53.198]  You want to understand what you're going to live like?
[01:42:53.198 --> 01:42:54.978]  Go get Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:42:54.978 --> 01:42:56.719]  I'm sure you've got old ones in the garage or attic.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:01.302]  Get the F's and look up feudalism.
[01:43:01.302 --> 01:43:05.266]  Get the S. Pull out the S book and read serfdom.
[01:43:05.266 --> 01:43:07.608]  That's exactly what we're all living under.
[01:43:07.608 --> 01:43:08.989]  You got me.
[01:43:08.989 --> 01:43:13.293]  You're going to be a sharecropping slave.
[01:43:13.293 --> 01:43:15.435]  A sharecropper's worse than a regular slave.
[01:43:15.435 --> 01:43:16.275]  If you read U.S.
[01:43:16.275 --> 01:43:20.159]  history, it was worse a lot of times to be a poor white sharecropper than to be a black slave.
[01:43:20.159 --> 01:43:23.702]  Because the slave owners, at least by law, supposedly had to feed their slaves.
[01:43:23.702 --> 01:43:24.363]  Not a sharecropper.
[01:43:24.363 --> 01:43:25.143]  You could starve to death.
[01:43:26.089 --> 01:43:33.333]  Quite a few families, kids starved to death, their ribs sticking out of their sides because they had to live and pay everything to the company store.
[01:43:33.333 --> 01:43:36.014]  I owe my soul to the company store.
[01:43:36.014 --> 01:43:42.097]  And when they ended the horrible practice of black slavery in the US, they just made them sharecroppers.
[01:43:42.097 --> 01:43:44.938]  And they were, many blacks pointed out, they were worse off.
[01:43:44.938 --> 01:43:50.201]  Out of the frying pan, into the oven.
[01:43:50.201 --> 01:43:54.623]  So the new global currency is gonna be in carbon credits, carbon.
[01:43:55.612 --> 01:44:00.898]  Just like we got the Federal Reserve Act, you have to have the taxing mechanism for a new system.
[01:44:00.898 --> 01:44:08.467]  So, the Federal Reserve took over in 1913, that same year we got the 16th Amendment for the private IRS to collect money for the private Federal Reserve.
[01:44:08.467 --> 01:44:14.915]  You notice you write your checks to the Federal Reserve when you pay your income tax.
[01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:15.696]  Did you notice that?
[01:44:17.998 --> 01:44:34.665]  Well now they're creating the open world government and it's going to tax oil at the wellhead, all beef, all mutton, all sheep, all fish, all pork, all poultry, all rubber, all plastic, all roads, all cars, all children, all television sets.
[01:44:34.665 --> 01:44:36.746]  Everything will have a carbon credit.
[01:44:36.746 --> 01:44:38.807]  It's already going in menus in Europe and Japan.
[01:44:41.107 --> 01:44:42.708]  And the locals get a cut.
[01:44:42.708 --> 01:44:44.048]  The county gets a cut.
[01:44:44.048 --> 01:44:45.029]  The state gets a cut.
[01:44:45.029 --> 01:44:45.889]  The feds get a cut.
[01:44:45.889 --> 01:44:51.972]  But under international law, the UN gets the biggest cut, along with the private banks that launder the money.
[01:44:51.972 --> 01:44:53.293]  This is the new currency!
[01:44:56.778 --> 01:45:01.341]  And to bring this new system in, they've got to first bankrupt this country in the dollar.
[01:45:01.341 --> 01:45:06.745]  And so the big banks have taken the hundreds of trillions, 23.7 trillion just last year, in the U.S.
[01:45:06.745 --> 01:45:08.165]  alone, and they've bought up real assets.
[01:45:08.165 --> 01:45:10.287]  See, when they get the money, it still has the value.
[01:45:10.287 --> 01:45:13.449]  And then they devalue it and send it out to you, and you're paid in devalued money.
[01:45:21.656 --> 01:45:28.421]  Now, I'm hearing Yuppie Radio and Mainline TV everywhere say gold, gold is the way to go, everybody get into gold.
[01:45:28.421 --> 01:45:34.765]  I've been warning you for years that as soon as it went above a thousand, the Yuppies were going to figure out it was the investment.
[01:45:34.765 --> 01:45:39.909]  And then that was going to cause a shortage, and now it's all over the news.
[01:45:39.909 --> 01:45:42.991]  Barrick shuts Hedgebook as world gold supply runs out.
[01:45:42.991 --> 01:45:45.432]  I have another article from MSNBC.
[01:45:47.998 --> 01:45:50.199]  There's another story up on Kitco.
[01:45:50.199 --> 01:45:52.221]  In fact, I thought I printed it, guys, and I don't see it.
[01:45:52.221 --> 01:46:00.405]  Go to Kitco.com and, like, the third story down says gold supplies in South Africa overestimated by 90%.
[01:46:00.405 --> 01:46:04.068]  Suddenly, South Africa got its bluff called in the hedge funds.
[01:46:04.648 --> 01:46:07.649]  And they go, oh, sorry, we didn't have that gold we said we had.
[01:46:07.649 --> 01:46:10.150]  It is now red-level insanity!
[01:46:10.150 --> 01:46:24.875]  Right as the rush starts, what the anti-gold trust group of gold mines suing the Private Fellow Reserve and the IMF for artificially suppressing the price of gold, saying there wasn't that much gold, it should be a lot more, now it's all happening.
[01:46:24.875 --> 01:46:27.996]  And I want to bring up for the next few minutes Ted Anderson to talk about this.
[01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:35.500]  Dollar falls, sending gold a record high.
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:36.481]  $1,133.20 today.
[01:46:36.481 --> 01:46:40.863]  I mean, this is getting insane, Ted Anderson.
[01:46:40.863 --> 01:46:47.267]  Well, I know, and I know you printed that off, Alex, but it's gone up all the way up past $1,141 since you printed it.
[01:46:47.267 --> 01:46:48.107]  Oh my gosh.
[01:46:48.107 --> 01:46:49.668]  It's much higher than that.
[01:46:49.668 --> 01:46:57.173]  I mean, all this morning I've been working on trying to put together a national campaign for your video, Follow the Republic.
[01:46:57.173 --> 01:46:59.154]  I think it's that important for people to have.
[01:46:59.634 --> 01:47:04.335]  And I've got my brokers knocking on my door saying, hey, what are we going to do for a special today?
[01:47:04.335 --> 01:47:06.016]  We got people that want to buy this stuff.
[01:47:06.016 --> 01:47:07.376]  And I'm like scratching my head.
[01:47:07.376 --> 01:47:09.016]  Finally, I had to throw up my arms.
[01:47:09.016 --> 01:47:12.717]  I said, just give them Friday's prices, and I'm going to lose money.
[01:47:12.717 --> 01:47:14.618]  That's exactly what's going on right now.
[01:47:14.618 --> 01:47:23.400]  The supplies of gold and silver at local gold pawn shops and jewelry stores, and you name it, it's all bought up.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.640]  There's very little left out there at all.
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.201]  The supply of coins is shrinking up.
[01:47:28.741 --> 01:47:42.672]  And here we have what I would consider the beginnings of a feeding frenzy, like you said, coming from the yuppie population, which is obviously going to drive premiums up in gold and silver coins.
[01:47:42.672 --> 01:47:46.475]  I just feel fortunate enough to be able to have opportunities every now and then to buy
[01:47:46.815 --> 01:47:50.978]  When the price ticks back, it's been so hard for me to hold prices down.
[01:47:50.978 --> 01:47:53.420]  Alex, I know my prices are going to go up tomorrow.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:54.741]  They should be going up today.
[01:47:54.741 --> 01:47:56.162]  I should have raised them today.
[01:47:56.162 --> 01:47:57.303]  I didn't have time.
[01:47:57.303 --> 01:48:04.589]  But I will offer the same deal I did Friday, because I already have to the customers I called that listened to your show all weekend long.
[01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:08.052]  I have Frank's currently right now at $246.
[01:48:08.052 --> 01:48:10.674]  I have British Sovereign's at $299.
[01:48:10.674 --> 01:48:14.797]  That is exactly the same price I had them on Friday, even though gold has gone up.
[01:48:15.217 --> 01:48:16.539]  From the $1,118 mark now to $1,141.
[01:48:16.539 --> 01:48:18.581]  I also have some supplies and I gotta say it's short.
[01:48:18.581 --> 01:48:20.003]  We have eagles, maple leaves, we have some of the
[01:48:29.091 --> 01:48:29.391]  Don't
[01:48:46.841 --> 01:48:51.204]  Let's be clear.
[01:48:51.204 --> 01:48:54.788]  Almost everybody else has sold out or running low giant premiums.
[01:48:54.788 --> 01:48:56.709]  You are now running out of gold.
[01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:58.671]  You bought in the market before it was $1,000 an ounce.
[01:48:58.671 --> 01:48:59.072]  It's now at $1,140.
[01:48:59.072 --> 01:48:59.592]  Ted, you have never
[01:49:05.490 --> 01:49:19.087]  Never, never in buying low, selling when it's high, at the lower price, changing the rules of gold and silver investment, you have never offered anything $100 under what the market was.
[01:49:19.087 --> 01:49:20.709]  You're saying you're offering gold.
[01:49:22.293 --> 01:49:27.835]  That you priced into the market 140 plus dollars below what it is now.
[01:49:27.835 --> 01:49:36.059]  I mean that is absolutely the best deal by at least 40 plus dollars you have ever offered here.
[01:49:36.059 --> 01:49:38.820]  People are out of their minds nuts.
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:42.702]  You were nuts when it was $260 and I said buy it.
[01:49:42.702 --> 01:49:44.743]  You were nuts when you didn't buy it at $300.
[01:49:44.743 --> 01:49:46.504]  You were nuts when I said buy it at $400.
[01:49:46.504 --> 01:49:48.625]  You were nuts when I said buy it at $500.
[01:49:48.625 --> 01:49:50.986]  You were nuts not to buy it when I said buy it at $600.
[01:49:50.986 --> 01:49:53.547]  You were nuts when you didn't buy it when I said buy it at $700.
[01:49:53.547 --> 01:49:55.988]  You were nuts when you didn't buy it when I said buy it at $800.
[01:49:55.988 --> 01:49:58.670]  You were nuts when you didn't buy it when it was $900 and I said buy it.
[01:49:58.670 --> 01:50:00.851]  You were nuts when it was $1,000 and you didn't buy it.
[01:50:00.851 --> 01:50:01.912]  You were nuts when it was $11,000.
[01:50:03.392 --> 01:50:21.924]  1100 and I said buy it you didn't buy it and now you're completely out of your minds if you don't take advantage of this super good off-the-charts awesome deal that Ted Anderson is offering 800-686-2237 I know there's no way Ted's holding this deal past tonight at midnight correct Ted?
[01:50:21.924 --> 01:50:26.987]  No, I need to change my prices today but I won't be able to now it'll have to go on tomorrow so
[01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:30.196]  The prices will be higher, Alex.
[01:50:30.196 --> 01:50:31.200]  They will be higher.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.183]  Gold has just run over $1,140.
[01:50:35.329 --> 01:50:38.030]  All-time record high.
[01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:40.130]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:50:40.130 --> 01:50:43.891]  They're there right now to take your order, whether it's one coin or a thousand elements.
[01:50:43.891 --> 01:50:45.931]  The Alex Jones Special, you won't get it.
[01:50:45.931 --> 01:50:49.152]  This is an insanely, insanely good deal.
[01:50:49.152 --> 01:50:51.672]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:51.672 --> 01:50:55.033]  I want to go over some gold shortage news with you briefly on the other side.
[01:50:55.033 --> 01:50:56.173]  Then our guest is coming up.
[01:50:56.173 --> 01:50:58.674]  More calls, huge news blitzes today.
[01:50:58.674 --> 01:50:59.134]  Stay with us.
[01:51:15.862 --> 01:51:16.282]  We're good to go!
[01:51:46.533 --> 01:51:47.193]  I think so.
[01:52:00.703 --> 01:52:02.004]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.004 --> 01:52:07.590]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.590 --> 01:52:12.615]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.615 --> 01:52:18.201]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.201 --> 01:52:22.886]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:30.536]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.536 --> 01:52:31.657]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.657 --> 01:52:38.343]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.343 --> 01:52:41.105]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[01:52:41.505 --> 01:52:44.527]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.527 --> 01:52:44.827]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.827 --> 01:52:48.310]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:50.051]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.715 --> 01:53:08.456]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.

[01:53:17.038 --> 01:53:21.799]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[01:53:21.799 --> 01:53:25.719]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.

[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:30.600]  I think so.
[01:54:14.275 --> 01:54:24.502]  We're going live at the second segment of The Next Hour, simulcasting the live radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:24.502 --> 01:54:26.543]  Here's a report.
[01:54:26.543 --> 01:54:28.684]  I got this from Pitco and MSNBC.
[01:54:28.684 --> 01:54:37.750]  South African gold on final death watch as top-grade scientist finds residual gold is more than 90% less than claimed.
[01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:39.812]  Research shows that production rate should fall
[01:54:40.834 --> 01:54:44.775]  Permanently below 100 tons a year within the coming decade.
[01:54:44.775 --> 01:54:48.435]  That dovetails with global gold supplies.
[01:54:48.435 --> 01:54:55.497]  Reported on in that headline of the London Telegraph, Barrick shuts hedge book on world's gold supply as it runs out.
[01:54:55.497 --> 01:55:08.259]  Global gold production is in terminal decline despite record prices and herculean efforts by mining companies to discover fresh sources of ore in remote spots, according to the world's top producer, Barrick Gold of Canada.
[01:55:09.079 --> 01:55:14.584]  And you look at the dollar plunging, other commodities going up, it's because the dollar is plunging.
[01:55:14.584 --> 01:55:18.527]  But not just the dollar with gold, it's because supplies are at all-time lows.
[01:55:18.527 --> 01:55:25.533]  We're seeing one of the biggest, if not biggest, gold rushes in world history right now.
[01:55:25.533 --> 01:55:33.160]  And it's very, very, very minuscule chance that in the next few years we're going to see gold
[01:55:35.082 --> 01:55:37.083]  Drop for any long period of time.
[01:55:37.083 --> 01:55:42.987]  All the experts are saying only up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[01:55:42.987 --> 01:55:48.190]  And it looks like the globalists, as Ted said two weeks ago, have decided to stop trying to suppress it.
[01:55:48.190 --> 01:55:52.593]  And it is just shooting up and signifying that they're doing that.
[01:55:52.593 --> 01:56:02.520]  Their mainstream media organs, after decades of saying, don't buy gold, while the elites were grabbing all the gold they could get at low prices, they're now saying, oh my gosh, buy gold.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:08.725]  So it appears on every level that it's only going to be going up and even though gold sounds like a lot,
[01:56:09.957 --> 01:56:10.237]  We're good.
[01:56:33.912 --> 01:56:36.516]  I mean, look, I only pitch what I believe in.
[01:56:36.516 --> 01:56:38.198]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[01:56:38.198 --> 01:56:40.441]  I don't sell guns, but I say you should get them.
[01:56:40.441 --> 01:56:45.667]  I believe in gold, and the parent company has great prices, minus resources, so I promote it.
[01:56:45.667 --> 01:56:46.608]  Ted supports me.
[01:56:46.608 --> 01:56:50.033]  Ted's gonna run ads nationwide for Fall of the Republic.
[01:56:50.573 --> 01:56:51.694]  I can't afford to do that.
[01:56:51.694 --> 01:56:52.555]  He's getting ready to do it.
[01:56:52.555 --> 01:56:54.556]  People think they have caught us in something.
[01:56:54.556 --> 01:56:57.678]  No, when we run national ads, we know everyone hears them.
[01:56:57.678 --> 01:56:58.659]  That's the point.
[01:56:58.659 --> 01:57:00.901]  The whole point is we are going after Limbaugh's audience.
[01:57:00.901 --> 01:57:02.722]  We are going after Hannity's audience.
[01:57:02.722 --> 01:57:05.704]  We are trying to recruit people who've been in the dark.
[01:57:05.704 --> 01:57:09.707]  That's the whole point, is winning the ballgame against the New World Order.
[01:57:09.707 --> 01:57:11.409]  We have the initiative.
[01:57:11.409 --> 01:57:12.810]  We're highly motivated.
[01:57:12.810 --> 01:57:14.091]  We've studied history.
[01:57:14.091 --> 01:57:16.672]  We know that fortune belongs to the bold.
[01:57:16.672 --> 01:57:18.234]  We are defenders of the Republic.
[01:57:19.114 --> 01:57:21.695]  And Ted is smart.
[01:57:21.695 --> 01:57:25.817]  When everybody else isn't buying, when it's low, he buys and then sells at the low price.
[01:57:25.817 --> 01:57:31.198]  When it's high, that's how Ted Anderson is really becoming a huge market force in all of this.
[01:57:31.198 --> 01:57:33.439]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:33.439 --> 01:57:40.722]  Ted, we got a minute left here and I've been ranting, but bottom line, what do all these indicators say to you?
[01:57:40.722 --> 01:57:46.284]  30 years in the business with them saying gold is running out combined with a giant bull market.
[01:57:47.045 --> 01:57:48.307]  Well, I can just tell you this.
[01:57:48.307 --> 01:57:53.075]  Right now, people are going to be looking back at $1,100 gold as a really great buy.
[01:57:53.075 --> 01:57:53.856]  And that changes.
[01:57:53.856 --> 01:57:57.061]  There's a support level that's being formed, probably somewhere around $1,100.
[01:57:58.522 --> 01:58:02.505]  And 35 is where you'll see it bounce back, if it does.
[01:58:02.505 --> 01:58:07.027]  But I don't think we're going to even get that, because it just keeps blowing through new highs.
[01:58:07.027 --> 01:58:13.952]  Right now, what you're talking about with Barrick Gold, they're getting only 3 grams of gold per ton, which they used to get 12.
[01:58:13.952 --> 01:58:17.754]  They can't afford to run at that production level anymore.
[01:58:17.754 --> 01:58:20.496]  There's just not enough gold to go around even coming out of the mines.
[01:58:21.690 --> 01:58:27.675]  Ted, we got this big guest coming up, and for the next five minutes, that short little segment, explain that.
[01:58:27.675 --> 01:58:30.777]  They don't just grab nuggets of gold out of mountains anymore.
[01:58:30.777 --> 01:58:37.503]  They have to smash up tons and tons of ore just to get a few grams, and that's even running out.
[01:58:37.503 --> 01:58:42.086]  This is a perfect storm.
[01:58:42.086 --> 01:58:45.629]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:05.086 --> 02:00:09.910]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:11.491]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.491 --> 02:00:12.412]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.412 --> 02:00:17.256]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.256 --> 02:00:25.262]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.262 --> 02:00:32.148]  A decade ago, back in 1999, I began interviewing a consortium of gold mines, mainly smaller ones.
[02:00:33.055 --> 02:00:45.671]  ...that knew that it was costing more money for them to mine gold than for what it was selling on the market, and they watched the IMF, the World Bank, the international arms of the Federal Reserve, artificially suppressing and they sued in court.
[02:00:46.676 --> 02:00:50.077]  It's now come out that, indeed, they have been fixing prices.
[02:00:50.077 --> 02:00:54.759]  Ted Anderson, explain to people the mining process and why everything is now changing.
[02:00:54.759 --> 02:01:00.341]  Because it's not just that the dollar is being devalued and people are fleeing to safe havens.
[02:01:00.341 --> 02:01:06.523]  It's also just that they are running out of recoverable, discovered fields of gold.
[02:01:06.523 --> 02:01:07.263]  They are.
[02:01:07.263 --> 02:01:11.944]  The big, rich veins of gold have been consumed mostly in the 1800s, but they did
[02:01:14.421 --> 02:01:28.695]  Mine an awful lot of gold up into the 1900s, but the tailings that they would put aside because of the processes at that point, they would only recover about 60 to 70% of the gold from the ore at that time.
[02:01:28.695 --> 02:01:35.522]  They came out with that heap leaching method in the early 1900s and that was by pulverizing the ore
[02:01:35.982 --> 02:01:36.283]  We're good.
[02:01:51.545 --> 02:01:57.789]  They used to be able to, when Barrick first started, they were able to get 12 grams of gold per ton of ore.
[02:01:57.789 --> 02:02:07.016]  So you got to figure this, a ton of ore sitting in a truckload and they're driving it down to this leaching pan and dumping it onto this, you know, this, this pool and sprinkling it with cyanide.
[02:02:07.416 --> 02:02:10.959]  Well, now they only get three grams of gold per ton of ore.
[02:02:10.959 --> 02:02:24.188]  So you can kind of see where the process is going because it costs a lot of money to pulverize and dig this dirt from the ground and then move it to this orb field so they can have the cyanide sprinkled on it.
[02:02:24.188 --> 02:02:29.471]  If you don't get enough gold out of the ore, then you're going to have to stop that operation.
[02:02:29.471 --> 02:02:32.874]  Or at least the price of gold has to rise enough so the little bit that you get
[02:02:33.675 --> 02:02:34.356]  Thank you.
[02:02:48.935 --> 02:02:58.843]  So, unless if there's some miracle of some type that happens in the future where we're able to discover a whole new ore field somewhere, I don't think that it's out there.
[02:02:58.843 --> 02:03:07.711]  And that means a shortage of gold at the same time where you have a depreciation in the value of the dollar and it's losing the economic global
[02:03:08.211 --> 02:03:10.553]  Well, Ted, it's not confusing that gold's
[02:03:30.825 --> 02:03:34.306]  All the evidence shows it's only going to go up, but the question is how high?
[02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:37.508]  Some analysts, mainline, say $8,000, $7,000.
[02:03:37.508 --> 02:03:38.648]  Most of them say $2,500.
[02:03:38.648 --> 02:03:42.469]  From 30 years in this business, what do you think?
[02:03:42.469 --> 02:03:49.472]  Well, you know, I mean, it wouldn't surprise me a bit if we had $1,200 to $1,300 gold before the calendar turns to January 1st.
[02:03:49.472 --> 02:03:50.653]  Well, you said that last week.
[02:03:50.653 --> 02:03:51.953]  That might happen today.
[02:03:51.953 --> 02:03:52.313]  I know.
[02:03:52.313 --> 02:03:56.135]  I know that's how quickly it'll happen, and I'm still staying conservative on this.
[02:03:56.135 --> 02:03:58.175]  I would think that we should be able to see $2,000 plus gold
[02:03:59.776 --> 02:04:00.377]  We're good to go!
[02:04:17.372 --> 02:04:17.512]  That's
[02:04:36.693 --> 02:04:41.358]  Meanwhile, all the elites are running away from paper right now into gold.
[02:04:41.358 --> 02:04:47.964]  1-800-686-2237 to take advantage of the best deal Ted Anderson and Midas Resources have ever offered.
[02:04:47.964 --> 02:04:49.205]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:49.205 --> 02:04:53.950]  You're paying for prices that Ted got in the market when it was $1,000.
[02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:55.952]  You will not find this deal anywhere else.
[02:04:55.952 --> 02:04:56.512]  There's no way.
[02:04:56.512 --> 02:04:56.572]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:56.572 --> 02:04:56.933]  Ends at midnight.
[02:05:00.316 --> 02:05:05.621]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:05:05.621 --> 02:05:10.145]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:05:10.145 --> 02:05:12.427]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:05:12.427 --> 02:05:14.049]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:05:14.049 --> 02:05:15.090]  There is a solution.
[02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:23.739]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:05:23.739 --> 02:05:31.207]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:05:31.207 --> 02:05:36.853]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:05:37.233 --> 02:05:43.255]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:05:43.255 --> 02:05:47.396]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:06:00.216 --> 02:06:09.383]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[02:06:09.383 --> 02:06:12.746]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[02:06:12.746 --> 02:06:18.630]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[02:06:18.630 --> 02:06:23.414]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[02:06:23.414 --> 02:06:25.756]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[02:06:26.016 --> 02:06:26.396]  I'm good.
[02:06:44.844 --> 02:06:48.569]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[02:06:48.569 --> 02:06:50.771]  That's O-X-Y Silver dot net.
[02:06:50.771 --> 02:06:55.758]  Or call about OxySilver, ZeoLife, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:06:55.758 --> 02:06:57.280]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:57.760]  Do it now.
[02:07:00.103 --> 02:07:03.484]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:07:03.484 --> 02:07:07.105]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:07:07.105 --> 02:07:11.687]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:07:11.687 --> 02:07:17.289]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:07:17.569 --> 02:07:22.352]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:07:22.352 --> 02:07:25.975]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:07:25.975 --> 02:07:30.778]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:07:30.778 --> 02:07:37.342]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:07:37.342 --> 02:07:39.304]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:07:39.784 --> 02:07:43.466]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.881 --> 02:08:14.106]  Well, I've seen him on CNBC, CNN, you name it.
[02:08:14.106 --> 02:08:19.593]  He's Damon Vickers, Chief Investment Officer with Nine Points Management & Research.
[02:08:19.593 --> 02:08:23.879]  Their fund is up over 63% this year.
[02:08:23.879 --> 02:08:26.502]  You don't see that with a lot of funds out there, do you?
[02:08:26.502 --> 02:08:28.544]  He has a long, illustrious career.
[02:08:30.936 --> 02:08:41.643]  And he has a 25-year track record of articulating investment themes with striking clarity and then holding his ground as the daily barrage of market noise forces others to falter.
[02:08:41.643 --> 02:08:43.824]  And I watch mainstream financial shows.
[02:08:43.824 --> 02:08:49.007]  Very few of them are accurate because most of them have an establishment spin.
[02:08:49.007 --> 02:08:51.689]  But this guy has been very, very accurate in the past.
[02:08:51.689 --> 02:08:52.870]  That's why we've got him on.
[02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:57.632]  And I was flattered to find out when we called him on the show that he is actually a listener sometimes.
[02:08:57.632 --> 02:08:59.834]  So, Mr. Vickers, it's great to have you on with us.
[02:09:00.401 --> 02:09:01.662]  It's great to be with you.
[02:09:01.662 --> 02:09:11.466]  Sometimes I listen to your show, Alex, every night, and I do appreciate the praise of saying that we're up 63% this year.
[02:09:11.466 --> 02:09:21.650]  We're actually having a really good year this year, I believe, and we're long golden oil, but we were actually up 63% last year in 2008.
[02:09:21.650 --> 02:09:26.172]  Maybe that's even better, but we had a really great year in 2008.
[02:09:26.172 --> 02:09:29.333]  So, if I got that wrong, how are you doing this year, then?
[02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:32.270]  Okay, I mean, we've had some ups and downs.
[02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.750]  We're long.
[02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:34.191]  We're doing really good today.
[02:09:34.191 --> 02:09:44.017]  I don't know if anybody's noticed, but oil is up close to $3 a barrel, which is a reflection of the dollar situation, which I know we'll be talking about, and gold.
[02:09:44.017 --> 02:09:47.059]  Gold is making new highs, and we're long gold.
[02:09:47.059 --> 02:09:54.183]  So, we're really happy with what we're seeing this year, and I think we'll continue to do good for the balance of the year.
[02:09:54.183 --> 02:09:55.784]  We like our positions very much.
[02:09:57.136 --> 02:10:04.441]  I want to go through a whole host of issues with you today, sir, in the 50 minutes we have, and you're gracious to give us that much time in your busy schedule.
[02:10:04.441 --> 02:10:07.623]  But first, tell the listeners who may not know who you are a little bit about yourself.
[02:10:07.623 --> 02:10:09.845]  You have a long bio, what's most important.
[02:10:09.845 --> 02:10:24.474]  Then let's recap and expand what you talked about last week on CNBC about global government, world government, end of the dollar, gold only going up, and what you see happening in the near-term, mid-term, and long-term.
[02:10:24.474 --> 02:10:25.275]  Break it down for us.
[02:10:25.902 --> 02:10:27.622]  Yeah, we'll have a chance to do all that.
[02:10:27.622 --> 02:10:31.463]  I mean, I've been running money for about 25 years.
[02:10:31.463 --> 02:10:37.824]  My father was a floor trader for Goldman Sachs on the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:10:37.824 --> 02:10:50.166]  My grandfather worked for Carapie Buddy and best friends with Bill Donaldson, who ran the SEC and is currently on, I believe, Barack Obama's think tank at this point.
[02:10:50.166 --> 02:10:54.907]  My great-grandmother, Catherine Angel, founded the Culinary Institute of America.
[02:10:55.947 --> 02:10:59.448]  Also known as the CIA, ironically enough.
[02:10:59.448 --> 02:11:04.129]  And her husband was president of Yale University for a number of decades.
[02:11:04.129 --> 02:11:08.950]  And I saw a lot of people when I was a kid.
[02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:12.431]  I saw a lot of people come in and out of the house.
[02:11:12.431 --> 02:11:14.671]  The Rockefellers.
[02:11:14.671 --> 02:11:15.512]  Who else?
[02:11:15.512 --> 02:11:18.412]  Kissinger.
[02:11:18.412 --> 02:11:19.252]  Just everybody.
[02:11:19.252 --> 02:11:20.953]  My great-grandmother was a kind of a
[02:11:22.634 --> 02:11:23.355]  Well, that's amazing.
[02:11:23.355 --> 02:11:25.577]  I'm flattered to have you as a listener.
[02:11:49.235 --> 02:12:00.840]  But I would see Christmas cards and the like from the Rockefellers, and our families had houses next to each other in Seal Harbor, Maine, up on Mount Desert Island.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:08.263]  And the story goes that John Dee's son proposed to my great-grandmother, but she turned him down.
[02:12:09.043 --> 02:12:15.168]  And married the famous psychiatrist who went on to become the president of Yale.
[02:12:15.168 --> 02:12:16.829]  Loved my great-grandmother a whole bunch.
[02:12:16.829 --> 02:12:18.311]  Great, great woman.
[02:12:18.311 --> 02:12:28.379]  Over the last 25 years, I've been very involved in growth investing, predominantly, and we were early investors in Starbucks, coffee, and Amazon.com.
[02:12:28.379 --> 02:12:31.701]  I've called two market tops in the last decade, notably the one in 2000.
[02:12:32.662 --> 02:12:36.003]  Okay, well I want to get into... Sure, fire out your websites for us.
[02:12:58.902 --> 02:13:00.123]  Uh, we have a couple of websites.
[02:13:00.123 --> 02:13:13.464]  I guess damondvickers.com would be stuff about me, and then the other site for our fund management would be www.npmnancypaulmary.us would concern
[02:13:14.378 --> 02:13:19.520]  Well, let me ask you this question, because I don't normally want to sit here and talk about myself here, but you're a big analyst.
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:21.080]  Why are you listening to this show?
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:22.021]  You're a busy guy.
[02:13:22.021 --> 02:13:28.443]  I mean, are you listening to try to see what the grassroots, what the trends are, or is it just an interesting show?
[02:13:28.443 --> 02:13:37.866]  And why are you coming out on TV, and increasingly others are as well, and talking about reality, the world government, the global currency, the end of the dollar?
[02:13:38.519 --> 02:13:39.160]  Yeah.
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:46.308]  Well, I mean, number one, one of the things, I mean, I did radio myself for about five years, and your approach, I think that's Peter Reeve.
[02:13:46.308 --> 02:13:48.270]  I know Peter Reeve.
[02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:50.052]  And I like your show.
[02:13:50.052 --> 02:13:53.636]  I like your, you've got a great feel to it, a great energy, great pacing.
[02:13:53.636 --> 02:13:59.723]  I can't say I agree with everything you say on the radio show, but you put on a really good radio show.
[02:14:01.144 --> 02:14:07.131]  You know, people, I think, like yourself, Alex, they're looking down a tunnel.
[02:14:07.131 --> 02:14:11.917]  You know, some people may see, you know, a light approaching, coming down that tunnel.
[02:14:11.917 --> 02:14:18.124]  And yet there may be some people that say, no, that isn't light, that's actually a 100-ton locomotive heading your way!
[02:14:18.124 --> 02:14:20.207]  You need to do something!
[02:14:20.667 --> 02:14:24.850]  Now, the person that says that will usually be called crazy.
[02:14:24.850 --> 02:14:27.431]  Oh, you must be, you know, you don't know what you're talking about.
[02:14:27.431 --> 02:14:35.176]  You know, no one necessarily listens to you at the moment, and when you're making calls like that.
[02:14:35.176 --> 02:14:38.839]  But the evidence cannot be ignored.
[02:14:38.839 --> 02:14:40.200]  There is kind of a momentum.
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:48.405]  There is a trend in terms of global developments, and there is a trend in terms of where things are moving towards.
[02:14:49.945 --> 02:14:52.166]  Some of those things, you know, my father talked about.
[02:14:52.166 --> 02:15:03.889]  You know, my father worked for the Institute of World Affairs for a brief time, and he would take people back and forth, like Henry Kissinger, like others, and they talked about this.
[02:15:03.889 --> 02:15:13.992]  This was well over 20 years ago, maybe 25 years ago, they would talk about dividing the world basically into three geographic trading zones.
[02:15:14.999 --> 02:15:29.411]  Um, and, you know, listening to my father at the time, I probably thought he was nuts, but, you know, now we see the Asian trading zone, we see this is before the Euro, and we see the United States moving closer towards that as well.
[02:15:30.796 --> 02:15:45.347]  Well that's the Trilateral Commission model stated by them and then I would read their own documents on air and people would say that's never going to happen and reading over their strategic plan and now it's come out with Goldman Sachs betting against the housing market secretly while they were
[02:15:47.073 --> 02:15:49.134]  You know, telling the public to invest in it.
[02:15:49.134 --> 02:15:51.334]  Clearly, this is command destruction.
[02:15:51.334 --> 02:16:01.978]  A lot of these groups at the apex of the pyramid, they're getting a lot of power, a lot of control out of these crises, which they understand in advance.
[02:16:03.063 --> 02:16:03.503]  Right.
[02:16:03.503 --> 02:16:07.326]  Well, there are problems beyond that.
[02:16:07.326 --> 02:16:11.330]  I agree with you.
[02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:13.752]  Why have I gone on the air and said that?
[02:16:13.752 --> 02:16:19.116]  When I go on the air, I really don't try to prep everything that I'm going to say.
[02:16:19.116 --> 02:16:24.520]  I think the more you prep your comments, the more dead the interview becomes.
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:28.804]  I've looked forward to our interview together, and I thought, well, how much prepping am I going to do?
[02:16:28.804 --> 02:16:31.706]  You can do a little prep, but the more I prep, the more candid it sounds.
[02:16:33.524 --> 02:16:44.609]  When I made those comments, and you may want to replay them, but I basically said that I thought that the world was moving, in all likelihood, towards some type of a currency crisis.
[02:16:44.609 --> 02:16:47.871]  And I do believe that it feels like we're moving towards that.
[02:16:48.829 --> 02:16:55.253]  In that currency crisis, you're going to have people that are going to be pretty panicked.
[02:16:55.253 --> 02:16:57.214]  There's going to be kind of a panic.
[02:16:57.214 --> 02:16:59.895]  Not just a global, but not just a United States panic.
[02:16:59.895 --> 02:17:08.900]  Because if the dollar really comes under pressure, and I don't mean just going down in dribs and drabs, I mean you come in on a Monday morning and the dollar is down 10-15% overnight.
[02:17:11.741 --> 02:17:13.703]  It's not just going to be the dollar that's affected.
[02:17:13.703 --> 02:17:20.548]  It will likely be other currencies that are also affected simultaneously, in a kind of a domino effect.
[02:17:20.548 --> 02:17:24.250]  And that could be kind of destabilizing on a global basis.
[02:17:24.250 --> 02:17:26.932]  It will cause kind of a panic.
[02:17:26.932 --> 02:17:34.197]  What would the world or what would global powers do in response to that?
[02:17:34.197 --> 02:17:39.041]  Well, if you had a total lack of confidence and all that, the first thing that they would do is they would raise interest rates.
[02:17:39.890 --> 02:17:46.227]  So you'd see this ratcheting up immediately of interest rates to try to defend their currencies.
[02:17:46.227 --> 02:17:48.032]  That, in all likelihood, won't work.
[02:17:49.354 --> 02:17:53.076]  And then what you have is the dollar still goes down.
[02:17:53.076 --> 02:17:56.237]  It doesn't matter how high they raise their interest rates.
[02:17:56.237 --> 02:17:57.577]  People just don't want them.
[02:17:57.577 --> 02:17:59.318]  And they just don't want dollars.
[02:17:59.318 --> 02:18:01.039]  They also just don't want pounds.
[02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:07.261]  They just don't want all of those, because there's utterly nothing backing any of the global currencies.
[02:18:07.261 --> 02:18:11.183]  They are literally wampum, just piece of papers.
[02:18:11.183 --> 02:18:13.964]  Not even paper currencies are made out of linen, but there's just nothing behind them.
[02:18:14.324 --> 02:18:22.009]  But if there's a currency based on taxing energy like the cap and trade or carbon tax, is that going to be one of the new units?
[02:18:22.009 --> 02:18:25.632]  And then of course commodities themselves, oil, gold, pork bellies?
[02:18:27.711 --> 02:18:30.492]  Yeah, pork bellies, but it's a good point about the commodities.
[02:18:30.492 --> 02:18:33.153]  I mean, that assumes that they're willing to do that.
[02:18:33.153 --> 02:18:41.236]  You need some type of a method of exchange that everybody can agree to so that global trade can be facilitated.
[02:18:41.236 --> 02:18:52.040]  If there's no agreement that you run into a panic, then they have to supplant those currencies with something.
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:55.581]  And it's into that breach and into that moment of despair
[02:18:56.505 --> 02:19:15.222]  From a global population whereby you would likely get a meeting of, I would guess, maybe the G20 at this point, or something like that, and the proposal would be put out there to that we've come together in this crisis, and out of this crisis, we've decided to form a new, an alignment, basically.
[02:19:15.222 --> 02:19:17.304]  And they would align themselves.
[02:19:17.304 --> 02:19:21.948]  And they would align themselves behind a new, I would imagine, a new currency.
[02:19:23.501 --> 02:19:33.511]  Uh, and if we're all trading the same currency, then you're moving more towards the idea of a new order, a new world order of things.
[02:19:33.511 --> 02:19:41.398]  And I didn't say that to just scare everybody, and I know there's all the stuff out there, but likely some type of a new order, I would guess.
[02:19:41.638 --> 02:19:44.800]  Well, that's what the elite themselves are calling it.
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:45.901]  Stay there.
[02:19:45.901 --> 02:19:47.341]  Damon Vickers is our guest.
[02:19:47.341 --> 02:19:55.226]  DamonVickers.com, fund manager, nine points capital partners, chief investment officer.
[02:19:55.226 --> 02:19:56.747]  He's our guest for the rest of the hour.

[02:19:58.988 --> 02:20:01.009]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.009 --> 02:20:03.931]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:20:05.165 --> 02:20:05.485]  I think so.
[02:20:20.205 --> 02:20:20.545]  I think so.

[02:21:11.503 --> 02:21:11.904]  Yeah.

[02:22:01.064 --> 02:22:03.705]  Good day, Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[02:22:03.705 --> 02:22:04.125]  November 16, 2009.
[02:22:04.125 --> 02:22:05.246]  Gold opened this morning at $11.2960.
[02:22:05.246 --> 02:22:08.668]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.6035, $5.8018 for a half ounce, or $2.9009 for a quarter ounce.
[02:22:08.668 --> 02:22:09.268]  That's $11.6035, $5.8018, and $2.9009.
[02:22:20.653 --> 02:22:34.258]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[02:22:34.258 --> 02:22:35.499]  Is this capitalism?
[02:22:35.499 --> 02:22:43.082]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:43.082 --> 02:22:44.202]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:44.202 --> 02:22:48.324]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[02:22:48.544 --> 02:22:49.645]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.645 --> 02:22:50.766]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[02:22:50.766 --> 02:22:50.906]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:09.522 --> 02:23:10.463]  We're good to go.
[02:23:25.493 --> 02:23:29.358]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[02:23:29.358 --> 02:23:32.581]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[02:23:32.581 --> 02:23:33.102]  Wow!
[02:23:33.102 --> 02:23:34.644]  I watched the DVD last night.
[02:23:34.644 --> 02:23:35.865]  I was awestruck.
[02:23:35.865 --> 02:23:37.547]  What wonderful work you have done.
[02:23:37.547 --> 02:23:40.090]  This information can bless many people.
[02:23:40.090 --> 02:23:40.791]  Thank you again.
[02:23:41.271 --> 02:23:42.032]  Thanks again!

[02:24:22.512 --> 02:24:27.794]  DamonVickers.com, he's our guest, Chief Investment Officer with Nine Points Management & Research.
[02:24:27.794 --> 02:24:34.916]  This is a short segment, but in the long segment, we're going to be taking some phone calls, your questions or comments for Damon Vickers.
[02:24:34.916 --> 02:24:36.296]  The toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:36.296 --> 02:24:37.817]  Specifically questions for our guest,
[02:24:42.638 --> 02:24:44.900]  On any investment issue, you can get his take on it.
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:51.286]  Okay, let's finish up with the New World Order, where you see the markets going, where you see gold going, how you see this crisis shaking out.
[02:24:51.286 --> 02:24:57.412]  I mean, I know you don't have a complete crystal ball, nobody does, but your best dead reckoning on where we're going.
[02:24:57.412 --> 02:25:03.278]  But when you talk about New World Order, talk about global government, studying that, how do you see it forming?
[02:25:03.278 --> 02:25:04.859]  What do you see it making up?
[02:25:04.859 --> 02:25:06.261]  What do you see its policies being?
[02:25:07.639 --> 02:25:17.786]  Well, that's a big one to cover.
[02:25:17.786 --> 02:25:19.828]  There's a trend, which is what we do.
[02:25:19.828 --> 02:25:21.489]  I mean, I'm a trend follower.
[02:25:21.489 --> 02:25:24.551]  So, the trend for the markets last year were down.
[02:25:24.551 --> 02:25:25.712]  We want to make money from that.
[02:25:25.712 --> 02:25:27.874]  We really don't care which direction the market goes.
[02:25:27.874 --> 02:25:29.575]  If the market wants to go higher, great.
[02:25:29.575 --> 02:25:30.175]  We want to be there.
[02:25:30.175 --> 02:25:31.716]  If the market wants to go lower, great.
[02:25:31.716 --> 02:25:32.317]  We want to be there.
[02:25:32.877 --> 02:25:36.581]  Gold, I got really excited about gold when it broke through $1,000 an ounce.
[02:25:36.581 --> 02:25:39.604]  I also got, we had gotten a long oil at the same time.
[02:25:39.604 --> 02:25:40.885]  Both assets are going up.
[02:25:40.885 --> 02:25:50.034]  We're making money in both of them, and we're doing really well with it today, because as we speak, gold is hitting a new high and oil's up about $3 a barrel.
[02:25:50.034 --> 02:25:55.819]  When I saw that happening, and this was the same thing that was happening last year, when I saw the break,
[02:25:56.660 --> 02:26:04.923]  Last year in the financials, there was a week last year where the banking index broke support.
[02:26:04.923 --> 02:26:10.965]  I sent out a release to all the media, and the title of that release was called, On the Eve of Destruction.
[02:26:10.965 --> 02:26:15.306]  The week that followed that, we had the worst week in market history.
[02:26:15.306 --> 02:26:17.847]  We went down like 20-some-odd percent for the week.
[02:26:17.847 --> 02:26:21.788]  It was horrific for most, great for us, and we made money that week.
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:33.348]  When I saw gold break through $1,000, that kind of felt like a tell to me that this would also involve the currency, which is the dollar, which we've also seen.
[02:26:33.348 --> 02:26:42.315]  So, gold breaking through $1,000 really says that the dollar is likely to come under increasing, increasing pressure.
[02:26:42.315 --> 02:26:48.340]  The dollar coming increasing pressure means an accelerated loss of value and an accelerated rise
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:50.101]  We're good to go.
[02:27:13.181 --> 02:27:18.266]  Of purchasing power for Americans may be really profound.
[02:27:18.266 --> 02:27:20.028]  What do we know about the dollar?
[02:27:20.028 --> 02:27:27.856]  We know that the dollar already, Alex, as I'm sure you know, the dollar has lost about 97% of its value since 1971, since Nixon cut the cord to the dollar.
[02:27:27.856 --> 02:27:28.717]  It lost 97%.
[02:27:36.687 --> 02:27:41.148]  And so, you know, the government has done all these things to try to shore up the economy, right?
[02:27:41.148 --> 02:27:44.629]  You know, we had the equity bubble in 2000, and then the burst.
[02:27:44.629 --> 02:27:47.549]  And then they go together, well, what can we do to keep this all going?
[02:27:47.549 --> 02:27:48.110]  And what do they do?
[02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:49.030]  They printed money.
[02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:51.190]  They deregulated the financial system.
[02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:55.091]  We had a separation between banks and brokerage firms, right?
[02:27:55.091 --> 02:27:57.152]  Because we'd learned lessons from the crash of 1929.
[02:27:59.332 --> 02:27:59.593]  What?
[02:27:59.593 --> 02:28:00.913]  We dissolved that!
[02:28:00.913 --> 02:28:03.114]  And banks and brokerage firms got together.
[02:28:03.114 --> 02:28:08.777]  Banks could then make risky bets with your deposits, which is exactly what they did.
[02:28:08.777 --> 02:28:11.419]  And this was all to juice up the economy in 2002-2003.
[02:28:11.419 --> 02:28:17.442]  So we juiced up the economy, and we created the second bubble, which was the real estate bubble.
[02:28:18.242 --> 02:28:18.983]  They took the bait!
[02:28:38.203 --> 02:28:38.924]  They sure did.
[02:28:38.924 --> 02:28:41.006]  They swallowed it and it was very toxic.
[02:28:41.006 --> 02:28:42.408]  And now here we go again.
[02:28:42.408 --> 02:28:50.956]  Last year, we have a meltdown where we're like, you can no longer, there are no more suckers left to buy those crazily-priced, insanely-priced houses.
[02:28:50.956 --> 02:28:52.678]  There's just nobody left.
[02:28:52.678 --> 02:28:57.003]  They've tapped into every fool on the street to give them a no-money-downpipe mortgage.
[02:28:57.703 --> 02:28:59.845]  And then we run into a crisis.
[02:28:59.845 --> 02:29:02.387]  Basically, there's no more sources of funding left.
[02:29:02.387 --> 02:29:05.809]  Last year was a crisis of funding.
[02:29:05.809 --> 02:29:11.493]  You could no longer find anybody to finance the economy, because that's what we were doing.
[02:29:11.493 --> 02:29:15.356]  We were selling these swaps on a global basis.
[02:29:15.356 --> 02:29:19.379]  We almost bankrupted Iceland, or virtually did bankrupt the country.
[02:29:19.379 --> 02:29:23.042]  And, you know, we look at Madoff and say he was a horrific guy.
[02:29:23.042 --> 02:29:24.363]  And the guy was no saint.
[02:29:24.363 --> 02:29:25.524]  He did some very evil things.
[02:29:26.244 --> 02:29:41.214]  But here in the United States, and here we as Americans, we have floated out this toxic garbage to the entire planet to finance our illusion of a lifestyle.
[02:29:41.214 --> 02:29:43.276]  Let's talk about that on the other side.
[02:29:43.276 --> 02:29:51.101]  Quick break, we'll come back, finish up there, get into your forecast for the future, and take phone calls with our guest, Damon Vickers.
[02:29:51.101 --> 02:29:52.502]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.502 --> 02:29:54.023]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.019 --> 02:29:57.710]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.138 --> 02:30:04.159]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.159 --> 02:30:09.481]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:09.481 --> 02:30:11.521]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:11.521 --> 02:30:16.523]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:16.523 --> 02:30:17.703]  How much do you want?
[02:30:17.703 --> 02:30:18.844]  When do you want it?
[02:30:18.844 --> 02:30:20.724]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:20.724 --> 02:30:21.804]  When will you need it?
[02:30:21.804 --> 02:30:24.005]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.005 --> 02:30:25.346]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.346 --> 02:30:26.646]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:26.866 --> 02:30:32.131]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.131 --> 02:30:35.715]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:35.715 --> 02:30:39.539]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:39.539 --> 02:30:40.780]  How much will you need?
[02:30:40.780 --> 02:30:41.661]  We don't know.
[02:30:41.661 --> 02:30:42.782]  How much do you want?
[02:30:42.782 --> 02:30:43.483]  All you can get.
[02:30:43.683 --> 02:30:44.784]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:44.784 --> 02:30:47.828]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:30:50.692 --> 02:30:51.453]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.137 --> 02:31:05.444]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.444 --> 02:31:09.970]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:09.970 --> 02:31:12.253]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.253 --> 02:31:13.875]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:13.875 --> 02:31:14.917]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.137 --> 02:31:23.561]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:32:07.059 --> 02:32:09.160]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[02:32:11.401 --> 02:32:13.061]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:33:11.809 --> 02:33:17.533]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:17.533 --> 02:33:21.535]  Damon Vickers from Nine Points Management and Research.
[02:33:21.535 --> 02:33:28.740]  DamonVickers.com is our guest and I'm going to really enjoy having him on from time to time here on the radio show.
[02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:32.203]  Very, very excited to have him here with us.
[02:33:32.203 --> 02:33:34.806]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors before we go back to him.
[02:33:34.806 --> 02:33:37.950]  One of them is a Cola Blue, the atmospheric water generator.
[02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:41.894]  It looks like a water cooler, a high-tech water cooler with no water bottle on the top.
[02:33:41.894 --> 02:33:43.596]  It grabs water out of the air.
[02:33:44.597 --> 02:33:44.677]  It's
[02:34:02.674 --> 02:34:04.115]  They've got them on hand right now.
[02:34:04.115 --> 02:34:07.977]  The Ecolablu 28 is their most economical model.
[02:34:07.977 --> 02:34:10.099]  Ecolablu, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[02:34:10.099 --> 02:34:12.400]  The best, cleanest drinking water you can get anywhere.
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:14.281]  And lastly, a plug for the online video bookstore.
[02:34:14.281 --> 02:34:14.782]  It is the Holliday
[02:34:28.681 --> 02:34:29.843]  Season right now.
[02:34:29.843 --> 02:34:34.248]  Don't want to be politically incorrect and say Christmas, but it is Christmas.
[02:34:34.248 --> 02:34:34.649]  I'm sorry.
[02:34:34.649 --> 02:34:35.309]  I apologize.
[02:34:35.309 --> 02:34:36.491]  I celebrate Christmas for everybody.
[02:34:36.491 --> 02:34:40.336]  I may be arrested in this new world order, but fall of the Republic.
[02:34:40.336 --> 02:34:44.240]  Give the gift of truth this holiday season.
[02:34:44.821 --> 02:34:45.821]  Here is the new cover.
[02:34:45.821 --> 02:34:48.442]  We had one with Obama on the front, but I like this one better.
[02:34:48.442 --> 02:34:52.283]  It's got the Statue of Liberty plunging downward with Obama down here on the bottom.
[02:34:52.283 --> 02:34:53.444]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:34:53.444 --> 02:34:56.004]  Two-hour, 24-minute film with a bunch of extras.
[02:34:56.004 --> 02:35:03.246]  Who the bankers are, what their new world order is, what they're setting up, the police state control grid, the mind control of the television.
[02:35:03.246 --> 02:35:04.767]  This is really my best work.
[02:35:04.767 --> 02:35:06.087]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:35:06.087 --> 02:35:07.668]  Give the gift of truth.
[02:35:07.668 --> 02:35:10.148]  This is a film that shatters the left-right paradigm.
[02:35:10.148 --> 02:35:11.569]  This is my best work.
[02:35:11.569 --> 02:35:12.069]  You can get it
[02:35:13.405 --> 02:35:14.066]  Free!
[02:35:14.066 --> 02:35:20.091]  You can get Fall of the Republic and then get an interview with Aaron Russo, Reflections and Warnings, on DVD.
[02:35:20.091 --> 02:35:24.735]  This documentary film, 90 minutes long, absolutely free in one of the combo deals.
[02:35:24.735 --> 02:35:29.839]  There's a bunch of other specials at InfoWars.com or ask about the specials when you call 888-253-2533.
[02:35:32.301 --> 02:35:32.862]  We're good
[02:35:48.655 --> 02:35:55.721]  Five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv, where all my films are posted and we simulcast the radio show in living color.
[02:35:55.721 --> 02:35:59.925]  I wanna thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:59.925 --> 02:36:01.786]  Okay, going back to Damon Vickers.
[02:36:01.786 --> 02:36:08.632]  Damon, we were getting in to the New World Order, what's being set up, what you see happening in the future.
[02:36:08.632 --> 02:36:11.855]  Tell me, how high do you think gold may go?
[02:36:11.855 --> 02:36:13.056]  What's the timeframe there?
[02:36:13.056 --> 02:36:14.917]  And then you were posing the question to me during the break,
[02:36:15.618 --> 02:36:16.979]  Well, we're going to have a New World Order.
[02:36:16.979 --> 02:36:22.301]  I mean, you're saying the dollar is pretty much going to collapse, a new system, but who's going to run that New World Order?
[02:36:22.301 --> 02:36:24.742]  So, David Vickers, break it down.
[02:36:24.742 --> 02:36:34.826]  Yeah, one of the things that you say, Alex, that I love, amongst some other things you talk about, there are those that are kind of conservative clones, and you know there are a couple of them on the radio.
[02:36:36.437 --> 02:36:44.602]  There are a number of people that are the other way, and that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are worth anything.
[02:36:44.602 --> 02:36:48.965]  That it's a total fantasy, one way or the other, that we participate in every four and eight years.
[02:36:48.965 --> 02:36:53.407]  And so it's not working.
[02:36:53.407 --> 02:36:57.730]  The other thing is that there is not, historically, all paper
[02:36:57.930 --> 02:36:58.791]  We're good to go.
[02:37:27.049 --> 02:37:36.383]  It's all over the planet, and the way that we do that is it's very easy, since the currency is not based on anything, to just print money.
[02:37:36.383 --> 02:37:41.971]  So the currencies get debased, and inevitably, the currencies basically get wiped out.
[02:37:43.533 --> 02:38:07.079]  Kind of a long-term historical cycle that we seem to go in, which is you get this debasement of the currency and a kind of a laissez-faire environment, which I think the speculation of the last ten years with the internet and the crazy real estate bubbles and putting Donald Trump back on TV, which was, if there was ever a sign of the New World Order and a sign of the apocalypse, maybe it was Donald coming back to life.
[02:38:08.019 --> 02:38:29.907]  And then you get the arrival, you get a disintegration of the government, a disintegration of order, right, of kind of chaos, and then desperation of the general population, and then the arrival of a focused focal point, or a kind of a more of a fascist national
[02:38:32.908 --> 02:38:34.568]  Kind of a dictatorship, really.
[02:38:34.568 --> 02:38:39.049]  You know, you saw it with the arrival of Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, this type of thing.
[02:38:39.049 --> 02:38:45.010]  I know it's hard to imagine that we could see anything like that in the United States, but it's a possibility.
[02:38:45.010 --> 02:38:54.352]  And so what we need to do is decide whether or not this is going to be a controlled landing, right, or it's going to be a total utter crash.
[02:38:54.352 --> 02:38:55.292]  Well, let me throw this in.
[02:38:57.338 --> 02:39:00.613]  David, I mean, Damon Vickers, the whole issue here is
[02:39:02.099 --> 02:39:05.982]  Speaking of David, David Rockefeller and others have stated what their plan is.
[02:39:05.982 --> 02:39:08.924]  They have implemented this implosion.
[02:39:08.924 --> 02:39:15.049]  Maury Strong talks about implementing this implosion on its ashes to build the new international architecture.
[02:39:15.049 --> 02:39:25.478]  They're telling the public none of this change exists while the UN Secretary General writes editorials calling for global government and global carbon taxes so that we're not part of the debate.
[02:39:25.478 --> 02:39:29.121]  They're just denying it's even happening while in serious intellectual debate
[02:39:30.041 --> 02:39:32.744]  It's all being erected and set up right now.
[02:39:32.744 --> 02:39:42.973]  And so my problem is one of their higher level sales pitches they use is to say, oh, the question is what type of world government, what type of new world order do you want?
[02:39:42.973 --> 02:39:45.756]  Well, how about we have a new world order where we don't have a world government?
[02:39:45.976 --> 02:39:51.239]  How about we have a New World Order where the central bankers engineering these Ponzi schemes go to jail?
[02:39:51.239 --> 02:40:03.604]  How about we have a New World Order where we have a global declaration of independence and national sovereignty instead of being maneuvered into, well, okay then, do you want to have a say in what type of New World Order are we going to have?
[02:40:03.604 --> 02:40:07.826]  The elite setting up this system won't even allow a real debate.
[02:40:07.826 --> 02:40:14.910]  They ridicule anyone that, you know, Limbaugh, Hannity, they still won't even admit this is happening after decades of saying it doesn't exist.
[02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:18.772]  I mean, you understand where I'm going with this.
[02:40:18.772 --> 02:40:22.454]  We don't have a say in how this government changes.
[02:40:22.454 --> 02:40:27.958]  And I understand it's sold as an evolution and a new world order, but the new world order has been engineered.
[02:40:27.958 --> 02:40:28.258]  Go ahead.
[02:40:29.650 --> 02:40:36.794]  We can debate things ad infinitum and yet nothing will get accomplished and nothing will get done.
[02:40:36.794 --> 02:40:38.675]  We're all afraid of change.
[02:40:38.675 --> 02:40:43.078]  We're all afraid of things arriving that we don't know anything about.
[02:40:43.078 --> 02:40:58.047]  But I think we have to all agree and admit to ourselves that the present order of things, the order of wiping out fish stocks, the order of wiping out the resources, and everybody believes that they have the sovereign right
[02:40:58.887 --> 02:41:02.629]  Well, I think there's a desire for those, there is a desire
[02:41:23.780 --> 02:41:27.863]  We've got a billion people on the planet right now, Alex, that are starving right now.
[02:41:27.863 --> 02:41:28.664]  A billion of them.
[02:41:40.732 --> 02:41:42.814]  That's a very large percentage of the population.
[02:41:42.814 --> 02:41:49.158]  We can look in the United States, how many people are, what do they say, one out of five kids' families are in food stamps right now.
[02:41:49.158 --> 02:41:49.419]  Damon.
[02:41:49.419 --> 02:41:52.661]  Clearly, clearly the order that we have right now is not working.
[02:41:52.661 --> 02:41:54.682]  We need something new.
[02:41:54.682 --> 02:42:03.249]  I understand that there are a lot of problems and crises, but when I read the Royal Commission on Population, secretly put out by the British government, now declassified,
[02:42:03.989 --> 02:42:17.121]  50 years ago, they said we're going to create globalization to control the third world, we're going to keep them from industrializing, even though that would clean up the environment and lower their numbers, because we're going to let the people bomb be used as a weapon against them.
[02:42:17.121 --> 02:42:25.368]  Just like the UN claims... We never should have gone into the third world in the first place, and every time that we go in there, we create more havoc.
[02:42:25.368 --> 02:42:31.393]  Even the compassionate things that we do, in terms of providing aid and care to them, only further exacerbates
[02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:34.341]  Well, Damon, let me just say this.
[02:42:34.341 --> 02:42:43.789]  I totally understand where you're coming from when you say the existing order is a bunch of criminal pirates raping and pillaging and looting.
[02:42:43.789 --> 02:42:46.551]  The problem is... This is where we agree.
[02:42:46.551 --> 02:42:47.652]  This is where we agree, Alex.
[02:42:48.618 --> 02:42:50.860]  But it's a two-face.
[02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:53.683]  You've got two faces, one here and one on the back.
[02:42:53.683 --> 02:42:55.925]  The globalists are the pirates.
[02:42:55.925 --> 02:43:10.358]  They then rotate their face around as the saviors, and everything they're proposing just gives them more power and has this frosting, this sugar coating of helping the poor and helping the environment.
[02:43:10.358 --> 02:43:13.681]  I mean, if they wanted to help the environment, they'd be restricting genetic engineering.
[02:43:15.410 --> 02:43:20.753]  David Rockefeller, and I know it's convenient to demonize the Rockefellers, okay?
[02:43:20.753 --> 02:43:27.777]  But we wouldn't have much of the national park system in the United States if it weren't for Lawrence Rockefeller.
[02:43:27.777 --> 02:43:29.378]  There'd be no Teton National Park.
[02:43:29.378 --> 02:43:30.118]  There'd be no U.S.
[02:43:30.118 --> 02:43:31.719]  Virgin Islands National Park.
[02:43:31.719 --> 02:43:34.381]  There'd be no Acadia National Park.
[02:43:34.381 --> 02:43:37.022]  There'd be no... I mean, the list goes on and on.
[02:43:37.022 --> 02:43:38.483]  These are people that long ago
[02:43:39.184 --> 02:43:48.848]  They made a tremendous amount of wealth, and then they began to turn their wealth to greater causes in trying to serve humanity.
[02:43:48.848 --> 02:43:55.131]  I think all of us would agree that none of us like seeing suffering.
[02:43:55.131 --> 02:44:04.796]  And to the extent that we can move the planet towards alleviating human suffering and more balance, I think we're heading in the right direction.
[02:44:05.846 --> 02:44:15.929]  Hey, Damon, I appreciate you coming on and I want to have you back up again because this is intriguing, but this is the slick New World Order sales job because I recognize what you're doing.
[02:44:15.929 --> 02:44:19.311]  I've heard this from other high-powered people.
[02:44:19.311 --> 02:44:21.391]  Hold on, but I've been given this speech before.
[02:44:21.391 --> 02:44:22.192]  Hold on.
[02:44:22.192 --> 02:44:23.852]  I've been given this speech before.
[02:44:23.852 --> 02:44:28.934]  What I'm telling you is the fruits of the people captaining our planet right now
[02:44:30.133 --> 02:44:32.814]  Look, the Rockefellers set up eugenics.
[02:44:32.814 --> 02:44:36.676]  The Rockefellers set up CPSing people's children and the family courts.
[02:44:36.676 --> 02:44:39.798]  They set up the Human Genome Project in Cold Springs Harbor.
[02:44:39.798 --> 02:44:45.801]  I understand they also set up some of the national parks because they wanted places where there were no people.
[02:44:45.801 --> 02:44:50.503]  That's good.
[02:44:50.503 --> 02:44:51.303]  That's good.
[02:44:51.303 --> 02:44:54.465]  Well, you know, what do we do?
[02:44:54.465 --> 02:44:59.467]  Our nation, the United States, enjoys a very high standard of living.
[02:45:00.474 --> 02:45:05.198]  Yes, we're an obese, decadent society that won't even engage in birth control, so we just abort our babies.
[02:45:05.198 --> 02:45:08.901]  We're a throwaway society, and so now we're being thrown away by the global system.
[02:45:30.956 --> 02:45:32.977]  Where is that?
[02:45:32.977 --> 02:45:45.182]  That we in the United States live that way, and then you've got people in India, in Bangladesh, in Vietnam, that are living in, making $0.67 an hour with members of their families starving to death while we live this way.
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:59.967]  Well, I'll tell you this, a lot of them are doing better now than they were just 20 years ago.
[02:45:59.967 --> 02:46:02.149]  I'll grant you that.
[02:46:02.149 --> 02:46:06.795]  But that's the globalist sales pitch, is guilt to what's left of the middle class here.
[02:46:10.249 --> 02:46:13.992]  But then our money, what's left of us gets transferred to the bankers.
[02:46:13.992 --> 02:46:15.334]  It doesn't get to some African.
[02:46:15.334 --> 02:46:16.895]  No desire to do that.
[02:46:16.895 --> 02:46:29.926]  We've got a rising unemployment rate and the reason why we have a rising unemployment rate is we simply cannot match the unit cost, the labor cost, the unit cost of production that can be achieved in Vietnam and Bang and Creek.
[02:46:30.578 --> 02:46:38.181]  But how does lowering our standard of living, when it's all fiat to begin with, how does that help Africa and Asia and Latin America?
[02:46:38.181 --> 02:46:42.143]  That's actually going to hurt them because they're not even going to have their customer anymore.
[02:46:42.143 --> 02:46:51.927]  This is how globalization and the giant sucking sound, the race to the bottom, destroys all sides in the end except for the finance oligarchs.
[02:46:53.166 --> 02:46:58.669]  If we don't try to create some type of a balance globally, Alex, we will be raising the cost of that bond.
[02:46:58.669 --> 02:47:03.311]  Alright, let me ask you this then, because you are an honest guy, we'll talk about the truth on national television.
[02:47:03.311 --> 02:47:07.854]  What do we do then, if Damon Vickers was steering things, what would you do?
[02:47:09.810 --> 02:47:19.675]  Well, I think we have to create a global environment whereby we have balance.
[02:47:19.675 --> 02:47:22.796]  And that's essentially the problem, I think, on a planetary basis.
[02:47:22.796 --> 02:47:25.358]  We're living out of balance.
[02:47:25.358 --> 02:47:27.339]  Our own country is out of balance.
[02:47:27.339 --> 02:47:34.002]  We cannot go and take a million tons of herring out of the ocean and know that it doesn't affect
[02:47:36.243 --> 02:47:52.267]  The oceans are really running out of fish right now, but the issue here is, again I want to go back to this, the issue is realizing that heaven is a place that is something that we, that the closest, our fondest imagining of what heaven is, is here on our planet.
[02:47:52.267 --> 02:47:57.708]  We need to take care of the planet that we live in, and not be raping it and think it's ours to exploit.
[02:47:57.708 --> 02:48:01.049]  We have to sustain our home, and we're not treating it responsibly.
[02:48:01.547 --> 02:48:10.292]  Well I'll tell you this, putting a tax on carbon isn't going to do that.
[02:48:10.292 --> 02:48:20.337]  But Damon, putting a tax on carbon dioxide is a giant distraction from real environmental policies that we could agree to carry out and make profitable.
[02:48:20.337 --> 02:48:23.419]  I mean, the government that we have in place right now is a total disaster.
[02:48:23.419 --> 02:48:28.101]  This whole move towards health care is just insane.
[02:48:28.101 --> 02:48:30.182]  Our government has become a giant tumor.
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:34.108]  He's taking the life out of this country!
[02:48:34.108 --> 02:48:34.651]  It's horrific!
[02:48:37.606 --> 02:48:38.846]  But, Damon, that's my point.
[02:48:38.846 --> 02:48:47.248]  It's the same globalists that brought us into imbalance, certainly nudged us in that way, using our own weaknesses to get us dependent on them.
[02:48:47.248 --> 02:48:53.609]  They got us dependent in this large-ass, decadent, laissez-faire welfare system so that we could be controlled.
[02:48:53.609 --> 02:48:54.969]  I have their own documents.
[02:48:54.969 --> 02:49:02.150]  They brag that they engineered this, and then now they're offering the solution that sounds somewhat similar to what you're saying.
[02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:04.871]  I'm saying the problem is, it's a setup.
[02:49:07.924 --> 02:49:11.506]  Well, I'd say that the participants also set themselves up.
[02:49:11.506 --> 02:49:16.689]  I mean, you're talking about you've got an addict and you've got a drug dealer.
[02:49:16.689 --> 02:49:24.995]  There's no doubt that there's a dealer establishment, but the addict is also partly to blame for their own behavior.
[02:49:24.995 --> 02:49:26.415]  Yeah, well, I agree to you.
[02:49:26.415 --> 02:49:31.358]  I mean, I agree to a certain extent, but that's like saying a 10-year-old who gets kidnapped, it's partly their fault.
[02:49:31.358 --> 02:49:36.622]  And it is true, they went in the front yard, they went down the street, they talked to strangers, they wanted to see the puppy dog.
[02:49:38.676 --> 02:49:41.358]  You know, we've got real challenges ahead of us.
[02:49:41.358 --> 02:49:43.359]  The dollar is disintegrating.
[02:49:43.359 --> 02:49:43.959]  We know that.
[02:49:43.959 --> 02:49:45.540]  That's what's currently happening right now.
[02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:48.021]  The dollar is losing value.
[02:49:48.021 --> 02:49:52.864]  Pretty much every day that the market is open is a day to sell more dollars.
[02:49:52.864 --> 02:49:54.065]  Gold is rising.
[02:49:54.065 --> 02:49:55.445]  Oil is rising.
[02:49:55.445 --> 02:49:57.987]  And it's not just the dollar that's weak.
[02:49:57.987 --> 02:50:02.509]  It's also the currencies in the United Kingdom, and it's also the other westernized nations.
[02:50:02.509 --> 02:50:07.372]  Because none of these countries are really viable-going concerns.
[02:50:08.272 --> 02:50:10.173]  We don't export anything.
[02:50:10.173 --> 02:50:12.313]  And we can't produce things.
[02:50:12.313 --> 02:50:14.474]  Globalism did this to us!
[02:50:14.474 --> 02:50:17.514]  Tax incentives to move overseas!
[02:50:17.514 --> 02:50:19.955]  I know, but we were set up, we were pushed into this.
[02:50:19.955 --> 02:50:23.616]  Big government did this.
[02:50:23.616 --> 02:50:29.837]  Well, I think it's kind of a cycle of how societies run.
[02:50:29.837 --> 02:50:30.658]  No, I agree with you.
[02:50:30.658 --> 02:50:31.878]  How high is gold going to go?
[02:50:33.414 --> 02:50:34.315]  Good question.
[02:50:34.315 --> 02:50:36.277]  It could absolutely go through the roof.
[02:50:36.277 --> 02:50:38.719]  I mean, it could go $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 an ounce.
[02:50:38.719 --> 02:50:40.540]  It's hard to say.
[02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:42.042]  The trend is up.
[02:50:42.042 --> 02:50:47.547]  And what is it trending towards over $2,000 in the next 12 months?
[02:50:47.547 --> 02:50:48.988]  Hard to say.
[02:50:48.988 --> 02:50:50.289]  This is an incredible interview.
[02:50:50.289 --> 02:50:51.010]  Damon Vickers.
[02:50:51.010 --> 02:50:56.054]  I'm going to try to twist his arm maybe 10, 15 in the next hour so we can take these calls.
[02:50:56.054 --> 02:50:58.897]  This guy, he's giving me a run for my money.
[02:50:58.897 --> 02:51:00.198]  He may be Beelzebub.
[02:51:01.598 --> 02:51:03.599]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:51:03.599 --> 02:51:06.859]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:51:06.859 --> 02:51:11.301]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:51:11.301 --> 02:51:20.523]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[02:51:20.523 --> 02:51:22.744]  Rely instead on OxySilver.
[02:51:22.744 --> 02:51:28.145]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:51:28.445 --> 02:51:33.888]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:51:33.888 --> 02:51:38.851]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[02:51:38.851 --> 02:51:41.972]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[02:51:41.972 --> 02:51:46.455]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.

[02:52:02.320 --> 02:52:06.321]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.321 --> 02:52:09.562]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.562 --> 02:52:10.983]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:11.696 --> 02:52:14.377]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.377 --> 02:52:20.759]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.759 --> 02:52:25.921]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:25.921 --> 02:52:35.924]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.044 --> 02:52:38.385]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.385 --> 02:52:39.986]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.986 --> 02:52:42.447]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.447 --> 02:52:44.568]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.568 --> 02:52:49.710]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.710 --> 02:52:54.732]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:54.732 --> 02:52:58.833]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:02.998 --> 02:53:04.219]  This is not a drill.
[02:53:04.219 --> 02:53:06.721]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:53:06.721 --> 02:53:08.622]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:53:08.622 --> 02:53:15.847]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:53:15.847 --> 02:53:20.250]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:53:20.250 --> 02:53:30.578]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:53:30.998 --> 02:53:32.379]  For any circumstance.
[02:53:32.379 --> 02:53:39.585]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:53:39.585 --> 02:53:40.305]  But listen up.
[02:53:40.305 --> 02:53:46.550]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:53:46.550 --> 02:53:48.391]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:53:48.391 --> 02:53:50.553]  That's hideyourguns.com.

[02:54:05.041 --> 02:54:10.388]  All right folks, I got one more silver dollar and they're not gonna they're not gonna catch me.
[02:54:10.388 --> 02:54:12.951]  No, I'm not gonna let them catch me.
[02:54:12.951 --> 02:54:15.715]  Not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.
[02:54:18.362 --> 02:54:24.387]  I'll tell you, this is an impressive interview and I look forward to future debates with him.
[02:54:24.387 --> 02:54:28.790]  We really appreciate Damon Vickers, DamonVickers.com, coming on with us.
[02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:32.813]  He is the Chief Investment Officer with Nine Points Management and Research.
[02:54:32.813 --> 02:54:41.240]  And he's one of the nicer, formerly East Coast Blue Bloods, here, hooked up with the Rockefellers and others.
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:45.723]  And he is talking about the world government coming in, and he is talking about
[02:54:47.031 --> 02:54:48.611]  The end of the dollar.
[02:54:48.611 --> 02:54:53.712]  And we're gonna, when we start the next hour, take your calls for all of you that are holding.
[02:54:53.712 --> 02:54:57.393]  Shanky, Andrew, Karen, Anita, and others.
[02:54:57.393 --> 02:55:00.973]  But just briefly, we were talking during the break.
[02:55:00.973 --> 02:55:03.894]  You're saying, look, I grew up in a Buddhist monastery or lived in one.
[02:55:03.894 --> 02:55:04.734]  I'm not Beelzebub.
[02:55:04.734 --> 02:55:05.314]  That was a joke.
[02:55:05.314 --> 02:55:07.114]  I apologize.
[02:55:07.114 --> 02:55:09.435]  I just meant you speak with a silver tongue.
[02:55:09.435 --> 02:55:11.895]  And I understand it's a very convincing argument.
[02:55:11.895 --> 02:55:15.856]  But are you saying world government is a foregone conclusion?
[02:55:18.484 --> 02:55:20.025]  Gave up all of that stuff.
[02:55:20.025 --> 02:55:21.245]  Gave up the Brooks Brothers.
[02:55:21.245 --> 02:55:22.646]  Gave up all that stuff.
[02:55:22.646 --> 02:55:26.227]  And I would sit and meditate with my father at 530 in the morning.
[02:55:26.227 --> 02:55:28.147]  I lived in a monastery called Odeon.
[02:55:28.147 --> 02:55:30.788]  I'm one of only three kids that ever lived there.
[02:55:30.788 --> 02:55:34.170]  It's on 1100 acres, and it's a Tibetan Buddhist monastery.
[02:55:34.170 --> 02:55:35.470]  Like, for real!
[02:55:35.470 --> 02:55:39.532]  And what they're all about is trying to alleviate human suffering.
[02:55:39.532 --> 02:55:46.174]  So, all of us would agree that suffering is something that we want to avoid, and that we don't like seeing others
[02:55:46.530 --> 02:55:49.291]  Yeah, but you're saying the system's bad we've got now.
[02:55:49.291 --> 02:55:51.293]  We'd like to see our planet suffer.
[02:55:51.293 --> 02:55:55.335]  And that we are living out of balance.
[02:55:55.335 --> 02:56:01.878]  And that we need to get not only the United States back into balance, but the world back into balance.
[02:56:01.878 --> 02:56:06.601]  As Prince Philip says, we need to call... Prince Philip says we need to call 80%.
[02:56:06.601 --> 02:56:08.542]  You're not for calling people, are you?
[02:56:09.850 --> 02:56:20.256]  No, I'm not for calling people, but on the other hand, you've got, if you're a West Indian down in the Caribbean, you think it's your right to have 28 kids.
[02:56:20.256 --> 02:56:20.956]  And they do!
[02:56:20.956 --> 02:56:22.017]  I've met them!
[02:56:22.017 --> 02:56:24.098]  And it's not sustainable.
[02:56:24.098 --> 02:56:28.921]  Many of those islands in the Caribbean, they were paradise, and now they're not paradise at all.
[02:56:28.921 --> 02:56:29.942]  Let me ask you this, then.
[02:56:29.942 --> 02:56:30.822]  Let me ask you this.
[02:56:30.822 --> 02:56:31.342]  Here's the deal.
[02:56:36.462 --> 02:56:38.543]  Here's what I have to say to you, though.
[02:56:38.543 --> 02:56:47.987]  That's why I made Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, my film about eugenics, because I agree with you that we should have a debate about this, and people should know.
[02:56:47.987 --> 02:56:57.271]  All these people eating McDonald's hamburgers, living in trailers, partying, watching porn, and having abortions, they don't realize that the elite have decided to kill their butts.
[02:56:59.212 --> 02:57:02.015]  I mean, I'm just glad that you're just being honest about all this.
[02:57:02.015 --> 02:57:04.097]  I'm not saying you're calling for killing people.
[02:57:04.097 --> 02:57:12.604]  You know, you're kind of the soft touch in all this, but I'm telling you, this is real, and the public better grow up and get off their fat butts.
[02:57:12.604 --> 02:57:18.990]  Our planet cannot support every one of us going out there and having 24 and 28 kids.
[02:57:18.990 --> 02:57:20.472]  It's just, there's not enough.
[02:57:23.663 --> 02:57:24.944]  Well, here's another problem.
[02:57:24.944 --> 02:57:27.805]  Only educated people are dying out.
[02:57:27.805 --> 02:57:31.127]  The West has 1.3 replacement for every two adults.
[02:57:31.127 --> 02:57:36.469]  And so, the West is saying they want to target the West for no one to have kids.
[02:57:36.469 --> 02:57:39.811]  So, the West has to die, and then everybody else can have 500 kids?
[02:57:41.578 --> 02:57:55.450]  Nobody needs to be targeted, but we need to recognize and come into common understanding and belief about what our relationship is to one another and what our relationship is to the planet that we live on and try to live responsibly.
[02:57:55.450 --> 02:58:00.554]  And having 16 and 28 kids is not responsible.
[02:58:00.554 --> 02:58:01.755]  I think all of us could agree to that.
[02:58:01.755 --> 02:58:03.756]  Wouldn't you agree to that, Alex?
[02:58:03.756 --> 02:58:07.720]  But the minute you don't let somebody have 10 kids, then you can't have two.
[02:58:09.665 --> 02:58:16.967]  Okay, and there are nations that believe it's their right to deforest their rainforests, but these are the lungs of the planet.
[02:58:16.967 --> 02:58:18.348]  Should they be allowed to do that?
[02:58:18.348 --> 02:58:19.948]  Because it's their sovereign right?
[02:58:19.948 --> 02:58:23.710]  Well, the nations, that's the oil companies.
[02:58:23.710 --> 02:58:25.870]  And Al Gore owns Occidental Petroleum.
[02:58:25.870 --> 02:58:27.771]  He didn't call them for stopping that.
[02:58:27.771 --> 02:58:29.431]  He wants to tax what plants breathe.
[02:58:29.431 --> 02:58:30.132]  That's what I mean.
[02:58:31.092 --> 02:58:32.233]  We're just evil.
[02:58:32.233 --> 02:58:34.915]  And no matter what we do, it's going to hell in the handbasket.
[02:58:34.915 --> 02:58:38.899]  And all these globalists have these great reasons we should sell out to them.
[02:58:38.899 --> 02:58:40.220]  But that brings more destruction.
[02:58:40.220 --> 02:58:42.823]  Stay with us.
[02:58:42.823 --> 02:58:45.445]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.445 --> 02:58:48.608]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.595 --> 02:58:55.160]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.160 --> 02:58:56.062]  Number one.
[02:58:56.062 --> 02:58:59.486]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:59.486 --> 02:59:00.367]  Number two.
[02:59:00.367 --> 02:59:05.252]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.252 --> 02:59:05.993]  It's true.
[02:59:05.993 --> 02:59:10.539]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:10.859 --> 02:59:11.680]  Number 3.
[02:59:11.680 --> 02:59:15.263]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.263 --> 02:59:19.187]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.187 --> 02:59:19.988]  Number 4.
[02:59:19.988 --> 02:59:22.730]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.730 --> 02:59:26.414]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.414 --> 02:59:27.214]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.214 --> 02:59:31.358]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.358 --> 02:59:36.123]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.403 --> 02:59:40.567]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.567 --> 02:59:42.369]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.369 --> 02:59:44.611]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:44.611 --> 02:59:46.974]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:00:11.425 --> 03:00:17.629]  We're going right to your calls, but Damon Vickers wanted to make one more point before we do it.
[03:00:17.629 --> 03:00:19.610]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:00:19.610 --> 03:00:31.818]  No, I just wanted to say, I mean, I am for people, and I'm for, you know, joy and happiness and love to be in greater abundance on this planet.
[03:00:31.818 --> 03:00:40.604]  And to do that, I think we have to elevate our consciousness to realize that we're all connected.
[03:00:41.272 --> 03:00:45.533]  And that we're all a part of the same family, the human family.
[03:00:45.533 --> 03:00:47.553]  And we have to respect one another.
[03:00:47.553 --> 03:00:57.175]  And we can only, sometimes the only way that you can actually even get to that point is through some type of a crisis or an event that brings us together.
[03:00:57.175 --> 03:01:01.376]  But, Al Gore they're now saying is our global priest, president of the world.
[03:01:01.376 --> 03:01:02.577]  That's in the newspaper today.
[03:01:02.577 --> 03:01:04.277]  Let me tell you, my discernment...
[03:01:08.888 --> 03:01:18.036]  This guy that sold us on NAFTA and GATT now wants me to pay carbon tax that this apple breathes to him so I'll all be safe.
[03:01:18.036 --> 03:01:23.480]  I mean, I'm just saying, you know, this guy's the head of the New World Order, I ain't buying it.
[03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:24.421]  I doubt that's true.
[03:01:24.421 --> 03:01:26.543]  A giant demonic Nelly.
[03:01:26.543 --> 03:01:27.684]  Yeah.
[03:01:27.684 --> 03:01:28.785]  I mean, come on, man.
[03:01:28.785 --> 03:01:31.627]  This is not my cup of tea.
[03:01:31.627 --> 03:01:34.730]  Listen, let's go to Shanky in Georgia.
[03:01:34.730 --> 03:01:36.011]  Shanky, quick, go ahead.
[03:01:36.696 --> 03:01:37.697]  Hey Alex, thanks.
[03:01:37.697 --> 03:01:43.241]  It's been a great conversation and I really enjoyed it because I'm right in the middle of both of you.
[03:01:43.241 --> 03:01:47.865]  I'm on Damon's side on a lot of things and you're on the other.
[03:01:47.865 --> 03:01:53.209]  To get to Damon and what he does for a living, out there right now there are a lot of top callers.
[03:01:53.209 --> 03:01:57.152]  He's done very good in the past at calling tops.
[03:01:57.152 --> 03:01:59.854]  We can all see the top coming now.
[03:01:59.854 --> 03:02:02.977]  You talk about riding the trends and the trend is your friend.
[03:02:03.778 --> 03:02:13.366]  And the crash of the dollar, I'm a big proponent of this, to wrestle this market away from the manipulators at this point in time.
[03:02:13.366 --> 03:02:21.152]  That it's going to take some type of external event, and could it be the crash of the dollar, you know, people are talking about wars, whatever.
[03:02:21.152 --> 03:02:22.974]  Can I get your opinions on that real quick?
[03:02:23.846 --> 03:02:28.188]  Yeah, I mean, the trend for the dollar is decidedly lower.
[03:02:28.188 --> 03:02:32.870]  The trend for gold oil, obviously, is decidedly higher.
[03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:35.091]  Do we need some type of an event?
[03:02:35.091 --> 03:02:40.173]  Yeah, I mean, ultimately, I think what you're saying is, ultimately, does the government
[03:02:44.255 --> 03:02:49.178]  Well, we've done that a couple of times in the past.
[03:02:49.178 --> 03:02:51.019]  I don't think they're really at that right now.
[03:02:51.019 --> 03:03:07.450]  I think their mindset is that a lower dollar juices exports, is good for the economy, and because they're not innovators, because Obama is not an entrepreneurial genius, he's a very well-spoken politician who delivers incredible speeches.
[03:03:08.250 --> 03:03:25.961]  So, I hope, I really, really, really, really profoundly hope that it doesn't take some type of a global war for us to revive the economy of us exporting military machinery over into a, you know, kind of a
[03:03:28.171 --> 03:03:33.353]  But the Rand Corporation is saying that's what they need, and that looks like where they're moving the next two years with Iran.
[03:03:33.353 --> 03:03:33.973]  I hope not.
[03:03:33.973 --> 03:03:35.253]  I really hope not.
[03:03:35.253 --> 03:03:37.574]  Damon, you bring up a key point here, though.
[03:03:37.574 --> 03:03:38.914]  The numbers are in.
[03:03:38.914 --> 03:03:42.755]  Manufacturing's down, even with a weaker dollar that should boost it.
[03:03:42.755 --> 03:03:46.557]  That doesn't bode well for the White House strategy.
[03:03:46.557 --> 03:03:47.637]  No, it doesn't work.
[03:03:47.637 --> 03:03:51.438]  I mean, destroying the dollar, I mean, inevitably doesn't work.
[03:03:51.438 --> 03:03:56.440]  There's an endgame, and the endgame is that you don't have a currency at all.
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:57.640]  And then that replaces...
[03:04:01.082 --> 03:04:08.693]  And that gets replaced with SDRs or a basket of currencies or a new global cashless thumbprint system?
[03:04:08.693 --> 03:04:12.038]  Well, I don't know that we're moving towards a thumbprint system.
[03:04:12.038 --> 03:04:12.799]  I mean, I think that we...
[03:04:16.084 --> 03:04:17.185]  We're good to go.
[03:04:38.082 --> 03:04:41.867]  Except promises, which is our, you know, our promises to pay off the debt.
[03:04:41.867 --> 03:04:42.588]  All right.
[03:04:42.588 --> 03:04:43.048]  Stay there.
[03:04:43.048 --> 03:04:46.011]  We've got to move quick in the final segment with our guest.
[03:04:46.011 --> 03:04:50.697]  To Andrew, Karen, who says she disagrees, Jeff, Anita.
[03:04:50.697 --> 03:04:52.859]  We've got to hurry, and I really appreciate our guest.
[03:04:52.859 --> 03:04:55.422]  DamonVickers.com is Damon Vickers.
[03:04:55.422 --> 03:04:56.303]  On with us right now.
[03:04:56.303 --> 03:04:58.025]  This has really been intriguing.
[03:04:58.025 --> 03:04:58.506]  Stay with us.

[03:06:00.612 --> 03:06:08.341]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[03:06:08.341 --> 03:06:14.449]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[03:06:14.449 --> 03:06:17.112]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.

[03:06:23.680 --> 03:06:27.744]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[03:06:27.744 --> 03:06:33.111]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[03:06:33.351 --> 03:06:35.433]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[03:06:35.433 --> 03:06:37.195]  You need to look out for yourself.
[03:06:37.195 --> 03:06:39.718]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[03:06:39.718 --> 03:06:44.443]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[03:06:44.443 --> 03:06:48.167]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[03:06:48.167 --> 03:06:51.290]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[03:06:51.290 --> 03:06:53.192]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[03:06:53.192 --> 03:06:55.294]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[03:07:01.573 --> 03:07:05.597]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:07:05.597 --> 03:07:08.841]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:07:08.841 --> 03:07:13.646]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:07:13.646 --> 03:07:20.053]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:07:20.053 --> 03:07:22.275]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:07:22.816 --> 03:07:24.237]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:07:24.237 --> 03:07:24.958]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:07:24.958 --> 03:07:27.079]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:07:41.710 --> 03:07:46.094]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[03:07:46.094 --> 03:07:48.996]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:07:48.996 --> 03:08:07.292]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv Big Brother.
[03:08:07.292 --> 03:08:08.273]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.057 --> 03:08:10.799]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:10.799 --> 03:08:12.380]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.380 --> 03:08:13.301]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.301 --> 03:08:18.146]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.146 --> 03:08:22.190]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:25.782 --> 03:08:30.205]  We are taking your phone calls in this final segment with Damon Vickers.
[03:08:30.205 --> 03:08:31.166]  DamonVickers.com.
[03:08:31.166 --> 03:08:32.287]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:08:32.287 --> 03:08:36.230]  Our websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:41.714]  More calls and a huge news blitz of information I haven't covered yet coming up in the next segment.
[03:08:41.714 --> 03:08:42.855]  Let's go back to the calls.
[03:08:42.855 --> 03:08:45.376]  Let's talk to Andrew in Missouri.
[03:08:45.376 --> 03:08:46.517]  You're on the air, Andrew.
[03:08:46.517 --> 03:08:46.938]  Go ahead.
[03:08:46.938 --> 03:08:51.541]  Yeah, I don't mean to, you know, derail the conversation because I'm loving it.
[03:08:52.287 --> 03:08:56.030]  But, uh, I just want to know what's up with Silver, because I don't hear much about that.
[03:08:57.694 --> 03:08:58.795]  Silver's good, Greg.
[03:08:58.795 --> 03:09:00.496]  Glad you called, Andrew.
[03:09:00.496 --> 03:09:02.198]  Silver's fine.
[03:09:02.198 --> 03:09:05.740]  It's not quite as strong as gold.
[03:09:05.740 --> 03:09:14.347]  When you're trading markets, you're investing in markets, you're always going to have the weaker sisters, meaning that there's the strong market and then there's the also-ran.
[03:09:14.347 --> 03:09:22.313]  My strongest advice to you, and remember this, is that it's generally a bad idea to buy the weaker of the markets.
[03:09:22.313 --> 03:09:23.434]  You want to buy strength?
[03:09:24.256 --> 03:09:28.260]  Does that go for natural gas as being a weak second to oil?
[03:09:41.787 --> 03:09:48.151]  Natural gas has been in this deep dive in price for months and months and months and months.
[03:09:48.151 --> 03:09:52.073]  You would have thought if energy is bottoming, why not buy natural gas?
[03:09:52.073 --> 03:09:53.313]  It's cheaper.
[03:09:53.313 --> 03:09:54.834]  It only got cheaper.
[03:09:54.834 --> 03:09:57.956]  Natural gas has been horrific year to date.
[03:09:57.956 --> 03:10:02.198]  And silver's not doing the same thing, but I'm just saying it's an ongoing process.
[03:10:03.854 --> 03:10:07.616]  So you're saying nothing succeeds like success.
[03:10:07.616 --> 03:10:09.977]  Why buy Yahoo when you can buy Google?
[03:10:09.977 --> 03:10:18.502]  The big one has a larger gravitational economic pull and is always going to accelerate mass at a faster clip.
[03:10:18.502 --> 03:10:23.684]  Yeah, Google, I mean, something may inevitably displace Google, but you don't see it on the horizon right now.
[03:10:23.684 --> 03:10:27.646]  But yeah, you want to stick with the best of breed and be willing to pay up for it.
[03:10:27.646 --> 03:10:28.867]  Don't buy the also-ran.
[03:10:29.554 --> 03:10:35.199]  And on the contrary to that, if you're looking to make money from a market going down, sell the weakest.
[03:10:35.199 --> 03:10:36.860]  Sell the weakest market.
[03:10:36.860 --> 03:10:39.642]  Okay, does that answer your question, Andrew?
[03:10:39.642 --> 03:10:50.150]  Yeah, yeah, usually, you know, I've heard, I don't know if it's true, but I've heard silver was 15 to 1, you know, 15 ounces of silver by 1 ounce of gold in the past.
[03:10:50.150 --> 03:10:56.335]  Yeah, it may be, but you sound like a person that's long silver that's seeking to justify their position.
[03:10:56.335 --> 03:10:57.596]  How much silver do you own, Andrew?
[03:10:59.095 --> 03:11:00.836]  I'm just, you know, I'm just getting into it.
[03:11:00.836 --> 03:11:03.298]  I've heard, you know, that the next best thing is silver.
[03:11:03.298 --> 03:11:04.699]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:11:04.699 --> 03:11:15.605]  Alex brought up the natural gas thing, and you're going to buy energy, you believe that energy is going to benefit from the dollar, and you buy natural gas, I mean, and it just goes down on you.
[03:11:15.605 --> 03:11:27.513]  So, if you're looking to make money from a decline in the dollar, and a rise in metals and more tangible, real stuff, my suggestion would be to own the gold, and to be prepared to buy it on weakness.
[03:11:29.153 --> 03:11:31.374]  Well, Damon, I believe in diversification.
[03:11:31.374 --> 03:11:38.096]  So I think, I've always told people, 70% gold, 30% silver, that's just my layman's view on it.
[03:11:38.096 --> 03:11:47.339]  And also, silver for the poor man, somebody who doesn't have a lot of money, that's good to get into because some people think it's not going to be as volatile.
[03:11:47.339 --> 03:11:48.359]  I mean, who knows?
[03:11:48.359 --> 03:11:49.420]  But I think diversification.
[03:11:49.420 --> 03:11:52.181]  But obviously, you're more of an expert than I am on that.
[03:11:52.181 --> 03:11:54.161]  Let's talk to Karen in Oregon.
[03:11:54.161 --> 03:11:55.822]  Karen, you're on the air with Damon Vickers.
[03:11:55.822 --> 03:11:56.162]  Go ahead.
[03:11:57.352 --> 03:11:58.333]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:11:58.333 --> 03:12:13.161]  I think maybe his grandmother didn't marry Rockefeller because she heard about the John Rockefeller that went in and hired thugs to murder people in Ludlow, the miners, who were actually opposed to the horrific conditions they had.
[03:12:13.161 --> 03:12:22.786]  Not to mention the Rockefellers donated to the United Nations, the eugenics that you talked about, and if you want to talk about natural gas, I think Demon right there is certainly full of it.
[03:12:23.627 --> 03:12:24.468]  Nice, nice.
[03:12:24.468 --> 03:12:25.328]  I like that.
[03:12:25.328 --> 03:12:27.810]  Well, my name isn't Demon, it's Damon.
[03:12:27.810 --> 03:12:39.178]  And as for the Bear Swipes at the Rockefeller family, I'm glad that I can go to Acadia National Park because of the Rockefellers.
[03:12:39.178 --> 03:12:42.700]  I'm glad that the U.S.
[03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:44.621]  Virgin Islands Park exists.
[03:12:44.621 --> 03:12:47.023]  I'm glad that the Teton Parks exist.
[03:12:47.023 --> 03:12:51.126]  And I think they've made many, many good contributions to the planet.
[03:12:52.182 --> 03:12:53.923]  Well, Damon, I mean, let me say this.
[03:12:53.923 --> 03:12:58.504]  I know there's a lot of fear out there, and all the stuff that you said, I'm against.
[03:12:58.504 --> 03:12:59.905]  Yeah, I mean, certainly.
[03:12:59.905 --> 03:13:02.585]  I mean, let me just say this.
[03:13:02.585 --> 03:13:07.347]  The Rockefellers are a diverse family, but the big prime movers are really bad news.
[03:13:07.347 --> 03:13:11.688]  I mean, I've seen editorials by David Rockefeller praising Mao Tse-Tung in the New York Times.
[03:13:11.688 --> 03:13:13.789]  We have that in my film, Endgame.
[03:13:13.789 --> 03:13:19.051]  But I don't think we need to set Damon up here as David Rockefeller.
[03:13:19.051 --> 03:13:19.571]  He was simply...
[03:13:21.792 --> 03:13:38.343]  Yes, we're not interviewing, though I heard a phone conversation at Bilderberg that was recorded, but the guy in the hotel wouldn't let me use it, where he called up David Rockefeller at Bilderberg 2008 and had a long conversation with him in the morning, and it was David Rockefeller.
[03:13:38.343 --> 03:13:45.388]  They called his room at 6 a.m., and it was like talking to Mr. Burns from The Simpsons.
[03:13:47.769 --> 03:13:51.452]  You know, the problem is, as you get rid of David Rockefeller, it's like shark teeth.
[03:13:51.452 --> 03:13:54.334]  There are other people out there pushing this same system.
[03:13:54.334 --> 03:13:54.835]  Exactly.
[03:13:54.835 --> 03:14:01.420]  And the man is quite advanced in age anyway, so you may be hearing his passing on literally any day now.
[03:14:01.420 --> 03:14:07.985]  But I was going to add, Hitler set up national parks and loved animals, so just because, you know...
[03:14:10.444 --> 03:14:12.945]  Yes, and a broken clock is right twice a day.
[03:14:12.945 --> 03:14:15.245]  A blind hog can occasionally find troubles.
[03:14:15.245 --> 03:14:18.006]  I mean, you know, to sit there and say, well, no.
[03:14:18.006 --> 03:14:26.128]  I mean, to sit there and say that the Rockefellers occasionally do something good, I mean, it's, you know what, though?
[03:14:26.128 --> 03:14:29.349]  You've got the courage to come on here and you're telling the truth on television.
[03:14:29.349 --> 03:14:31.990]  We just appreciate Damon Vickers for coming on this show.
[03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:33.390]  Let's take a few more calls.
[03:14:33.390 --> 03:14:36.071]  Let's talk to, did you have anything else to add, Karen?
[03:14:37.406 --> 03:14:38.487]  Okay, she's gone.
[03:14:38.487 --> 03:14:40.129]  Let's go to Anita in Texas.
[03:14:40.129 --> 03:14:42.692]  Anita, you're on the air with Mr. Vickers.
[03:14:43.951 --> 03:14:50.474]  Yeah, I just wanted to... Actually, the lady before me took pretty much the words right out of my mouth.
[03:14:50.474 --> 03:15:06.342]  I was going to say the same thing you said just now to Alex, that, you know, they do a few good things probably for their own benefit and have done, but that doesn't make up for the things they have done bad and are doing and are planning to do.
[03:15:06.342 --> 03:15:08.743]  And if they were really for the environment,
[03:15:09.483 --> 03:15:10.184]  Yeah, the groom of the stool!
[03:15:30.487 --> 03:15:33.028]  Every one of us, Anita, has a number of servants.
[03:15:33.028 --> 03:15:37.451]  They're just located in a different country, like Bangladesh, Vietnam, or India.
[03:15:37.451 --> 03:15:38.331]  I mean, what's that number?
[03:15:38.331 --> 03:15:39.952]  Maybe 20, 30 to 1?
[03:15:39.952 --> 03:15:45.535]  How many people over in the third world, Anita, do you imagine it takes to support our lifestyle here?
[03:15:45.535 --> 03:15:54.919]  How many dupes around the world, how many countries around the world do we have to basically plunge into economic chaos to support our standard of living?
[03:15:54.919 --> 03:15:55.860]  Well, Anita, let me say this.
[03:16:00.418 --> 03:16:01.359]  I mean, it's different.
[03:16:01.359 --> 03:16:01.739]  It's homegrown.
[03:16:22.984 --> 03:16:39.807]  Well, we're coming up, as we speak today, the markets have actually been really strong, and it looks like we're breaking the downtrend of the 2007 peak, meaning that we've hit this line a number of times, and the markets may break that downtrend.
[03:16:39.807 --> 03:16:47.549]  If they do, a lot of the people that have shorted the market in recent weeks, thinking the market was overbought, will be forced to cover, and then we go higher.
[03:16:47.549 --> 03:16:48.969]  Your question, how high will it go?
[03:16:49.749 --> 03:16:54.051]  In theory, we could go all the way back up to the highs of 2007.
[03:16:54.051 --> 03:16:56.792]  I know that'd make people feel a lot better.
[03:16:56.792 --> 03:16:59.993]  And of course, they'll go out and spend some money.
[03:16:59.993 --> 03:17:08.196]  However, it's an illusion, because while that's happening, the dollar is probably going lower, so they may actually be making nothing.
[03:17:08.196 --> 03:17:11.458]  So it's like endorphins flooding the brain as you're dying.
[03:17:11.458 --> 03:17:12.518]  It's a sucker's rally.
[03:17:15.270 --> 03:17:25.657]  Until we meaningfully break out, and what I mean by meaningfully break out, I mean this market not only goes up, but it takes out the 2007 highs.
[03:17:25.657 --> 03:17:30.120]  This is all kind of interesting, an interesting game to watch.
[03:17:30.120 --> 03:17:40.388]  And the only way that can happen is the arrival of a social trend, an adoption cycle, and an investment cycle, a total bull market, whereby we start creating some employment.
[03:17:40.388 --> 03:17:42.369]  Is there any down in gold?
[03:17:42.369 --> 03:17:44.751]  Is there any, I mean, do you see any way it's going to plunge?
[03:17:46.418 --> 03:17:52.780]  Well, I don't know that it's going to plunge, but there certainly could be days, there could even be weeks where gold does go down.
[03:17:52.780 --> 03:18:07.403]  I would, from a trading standpoint, I would be watching that $1,000 level as kind of our risk management point, is that if gold breaks below $1,000 significantly, we have to watch that.
[03:18:07.403 --> 03:18:10.564]  But on the long graph, you believe it's only going up for the foreseeable future?
[03:18:11.617 --> 03:18:14.558]  I think the trends on gold are very, very strong.
[03:18:14.558 --> 03:18:20.640]  I think we'll see $1350, $1400 and we may even see prices well beyond that.
[03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:22.800]  Real quick call from Kyle in Pennsylvania.
[03:18:22.800 --> 03:18:25.401]  Kyle, you're on the air with Damon Vickers.
[03:18:25.401 --> 03:18:26.821]  Yeah, I got a question.
[03:18:26.821 --> 03:18:28.742]  Like today, for example, we see that
[03:18:29.389 --> 03:18:30.550]  Yeah, that's what he's saying.
[03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.910]  Go ahead.
[03:18:49.175 --> 03:18:49.295]  Yeah.
[03:18:49.295 --> 03:18:49.395]  Yeah.
[03:19:10.641 --> 03:19:10.762]  Okay.
[03:19:21.260 --> 03:19:22.240]  We got to cut it there.
[03:19:22.240 --> 03:19:23.161]  We got to cut it there.
[03:19:23.161 --> 03:19:23.921]  Thank you, Kyle.
[03:19:23.921 --> 03:19:25.421]  I'll take more calls coming up.
[03:19:25.421 --> 03:19:27.622]  I'll tell you, you gave us an hour and 15 minutes.
[03:19:27.622 --> 03:19:29.002]  We are very thankful.
[03:19:29.002 --> 03:19:30.743]  DamonVickers.com.
[03:19:30.743 --> 03:19:33.103]  Damon Vickers, thank you for spending time with us today.
[03:19:33.103 --> 03:19:42.506]  This was an amazing interview, and I really look forward to having you back up with us in the future to give us a different perspective, and it's been very informative.
[03:19:42.506 --> 03:19:42.806]  Thank you.
[03:19:45.182 --> 03:19:46.664]  Let me say bye to you here at the break.
[03:19:46.664 --> 03:19:48.507]  Thank you so much for that interview.
[03:19:48.507 --> 03:19:52.053]  That'll definitely make the rounds of the internet for some time to come.
[03:19:52.053 --> 03:19:57.021]  We even got a little talk of the Queen of England and her servants in there, which I always like to do.
[03:19:57.021 --> 03:19:57.822]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:57.822 --> 03:19:59.104]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.

[03:21:02.401 --> 03:21:06.424]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.424 --> 03:21:09.667]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:09.667 --> 03:21:11.088]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:21:11.792 --> 03:21:14.473]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:14.473 --> 03:21:20.856]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:20.856 --> 03:21:26.399]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.399 --> 03:21:36.044]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.144 --> 03:21:38.486]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.486 --> 03:21:40.087]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.087 --> 03:21:42.549]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.549 --> 03:21:44.671]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.671 --> 03:21:49.835]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:22:00.882 --> 03:22:05.444]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:22:05.444 --> 03:22:06.344]  Number one.
[03:22:06.344 --> 03:22:09.766]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:22:09.766 --> 03:22:10.646]  Number two.
[03:22:10.646 --> 03:22:15.528]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:22:15.528 --> 03:22:16.268]  It's true.
[03:22:16.268 --> 03:22:20.810]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:22:21.130 --> 03:22:21.971]  Number 3.
[03:22:21.971 --> 03:22:25.556]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:22:25.556 --> 03:22:29.481]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:22:29.481 --> 03:22:30.263]  Number 4.
[03:22:30.263 --> 03:22:33.026]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:22:33.026 --> 03:22:36.711]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:22:36.711 --> 03:22:36.931]  Number 5.
[03:22:37.492 --> 03:22:41.636]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:22:41.636 --> 03:22:46.681]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:22:46.681 --> 03:22:50.865]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:23:12.079 --> 03:23:13.900]  Watch me!
[03:23:13.900 --> 03:23:15.901]  Watch me!
[03:23:15.901 --> 03:23:17.723]  I got it!
[03:23:17.723 --> 03:23:19.724]  Watch me!
[03:23:19.724 --> 03:23:21.065]  I got it!
[03:23:21.065 --> 03:23:22.626]  Hey!
[03:23:22.626 --> 03:23:26.148]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[03:23:26.148 --> 03:23:29.490]  I got something that tells me what it's all about!
[03:23:29.490 --> 03:23:32.132]  I got soul!
[03:23:32.132 --> 03:23:34.013]  And I'm super bad!
[03:23:34.013 --> 03:23:39.737]  I got soul!
[03:23:39.737 --> 03:23:41.338]  And I'm super bad!
[03:23:44.652 --> 03:23:45.673]  Damon Vickers
[03:24:14.935 --> 03:24:15.616]  Interesting interview.
[03:24:15.616 --> 03:24:22.983]  You know, I don't think he's an evil person or a bad guy and he is a regular listener and I quiz him during breaks.
[03:24:22.983 --> 03:24:34.594]  But that's why Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, came on this show and during the breaks tried to convince me about globalism and the new world order and that it was a foregone conclusion so I might as well have my voice heard in all of it.
[03:24:35.506 --> 03:24:46.235]  And that's the thing, you can talk to these guys, and they'll admit it's all going on, and then the rest of the mainstream media says it doesn't exist, so we can't even have a real debate about it.
[03:24:46.235 --> 03:24:53.922]  And that's because there's a lot of different people that... He doesn't even really believe in globalization, he's saying it's happening, so what are we gonna do?
[03:24:53.922 --> 03:24:56.805]  But that's almost a mind trick of capitulation to it.
[03:24:56.805 --> 03:24:59.086]  But I appreciate him giving us an hour and 20 minutes, and...
[03:25:01.909 --> 03:25:09.311]  I'm excited to know we can have him and others back on the show so you can get the speech I've gotten many times from people of his similar ilk.
[03:25:09.311 --> 03:25:29.837]  Now, a little bit more extreme globalist, Aaron Russo, in his final interview, final videotape interview I did with him that we made into a film, Reflections and Warnings, he talks about Nick Rockefeller, going, look, everybody's going to have microchips, and our chips, the elite's chips, are going to say, kiss my butt.
[03:25:32.366 --> 03:25:38.048]  He told him this a decade ago, and how they're going to reduce the world population as soon as their world government's in place.
[03:25:38.048 --> 03:25:45.572]  Well, I have government policy textbooks by the White House science czar, like Ecoscience, saying the same thing.
[03:25:45.572 --> 03:25:47.973]  And they really believe this is for everyone's own good.
[03:25:47.973 --> 03:25:53.735]  But what it turns into is total corruption and a nightmare.
[03:25:53.735 --> 03:25:59.978]  If you go back and
[03:26:00.965 --> 03:26:03.946]  Look at all the things the New World Order crowd have engineered and carried out.
[03:26:03.946 --> 03:26:04.846]  It's horrible.
[03:26:04.846 --> 03:26:29.574]  And if you look at California, that series of articles that were in all their major newspapers in the last couple years, where over a million police and state employees and others are above the law, their license plates cannot be read by the license plate reading software that all of our license plates get read by.
[03:26:29.574 --> 03:26:30.434]  They're exempt.
[03:26:31.638 --> 03:26:32.939]  From the law.
[03:26:32.939 --> 03:26:34.040]  Just like illegal aliens.
[03:26:34.040 --> 03:26:37.963]  The globalists want illegal aliens here to drive down wages, to globalize the U.S.
[03:26:37.963 --> 03:26:41.345]  I'm not against the illegal aliens, but I know they're being used as a tool.
[03:26:41.345 --> 03:26:42.486]  I'm not against water.
[03:26:42.486 --> 03:26:43.226]  I love water.
[03:26:43.226 --> 03:26:44.747]  I like swimming in it.
[03:26:44.747 --> 03:26:49.210]  But I don't want somebody to cram a fire hose down my throat and blow my guts out.
[03:26:49.210 --> 03:26:56.275]  I don't want to have my arms bound and a bowling ball tied to me and be thrown into the Atlantic Ocean.
[03:26:56.275 --> 03:26:59.458]  So see, I don't dislike the illegal aliens, but they are
[03:27:01.351 --> 03:27:10.276]  A bottomless pit of third world labor that will drive down the wages and destroy their future and my future and my family's future.
[03:27:10.276 --> 03:27:12.477]  So I'm forced to speak out against them.
[03:27:12.477 --> 03:27:20.221]  And I can't sit here and make the decision for third world populations that are having five, six, seven kids.
[03:27:20.221 --> 03:27:21.142]  Most of them aren't having 20.
[03:27:21.142 --> 03:27:24.564]  The average of the third world's about four.
[03:27:24.564 --> 03:27:26.725]  On average, they have about six kids, but two of them die.
[03:27:28.820 --> 03:27:30.082]  These things will balance out.
[03:27:30.082 --> 03:27:31.464]  There's been major studies put out.
[03:27:31.464 --> 03:27:33.728]  The Earth can take 10 million people.
[03:27:33.728 --> 03:27:37.714]  The world population is trending to start dropping at 8 billion in 2020.
[03:27:42.128 --> 03:27:53.171]  Certainly, we have a lot of dirty technologies that are hurting the earth, but you cannot allow this elite group to covertly spike your vaccines, spike your water, and do this.
[03:27:53.171 --> 03:27:58.492]  But then the elite's argument is always, well, Alex, aren't the people guilty of this?
[03:27:58.492 --> 03:28:01.153]  The information you have is public, but they don't care.
[03:28:04.139 --> 03:28:05.400]  And there is an argument there.
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:09.185]  You know, he said, well, somebody who gets conned, they were part of the con.
[03:28:09.185 --> 03:28:14.010]  People that took these loans on houses they couldn't pay back, aren't they part of the fraud too?
[03:28:14.010 --> 03:28:24.962]  And my analogy is, yeah, a seven or eight-year-old kid who disregards their parents' warning and goes out in the front yard and talks to the man in the van that has the puppy dog,
[03:28:26.897 --> 03:28:30.099]  Or the little kid that's with them they use to lure the other kid.
[03:28:30.099 --> 03:28:39.204]  Yes, that five, six, seven, eight-year-old, nine-year-old, they are guilty of not listening to their parents and they should get in trouble.
[03:28:39.204 --> 03:28:45.768]  Do they deserve to be hogtied and raped for six weeks and then have a snuff film made of their head being macheted off?
[03:28:45.768 --> 03:28:47.569]  No.
[03:28:47.569 --> 03:28:51.211]  They don't deserve to be raped and have their head macheted off.
[03:28:51.211 --> 03:28:51.771]  With a machete.
[03:28:54.033 --> 03:29:05.479]  And once you buy into, oh, we've got to stop human suffering with a global government, it will fix it, you have fallen to the New World Order.
[03:29:05.479 --> 03:29:08.621]  And that's why this film, Reflections and Warnings, is so important.
[03:29:08.621 --> 03:29:12.083]  People that see it are like, man, this is really informative.
[03:29:12.083 --> 03:29:19.887]  Because I'm in it, separate little clips, video clips, documentation, and then you see the stuff Aaron Russo said two and a half years ago before he died.
[03:29:21.144 --> 03:29:23.185]  He was getting cancer treatment in Houston.
[03:29:23.185 --> 03:29:24.586]  So much of it has come true.
[03:29:24.586 --> 03:29:29.970]  Get this free with a whole bunch of combo deals we have on the shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[03:29:29.970 --> 03:29:35.313]  Get Reflections and Warnings free when you get it with Fall of the Republic and with Endgame.
[03:29:35.313 --> 03:29:38.496]  We have a bunch of different combo deals and Obama Deception.
[03:29:38.496 --> 03:29:39.736]  I want to get this film out.
[03:29:39.736 --> 03:29:40.597]  It needs to be seen.
[03:29:40.597 --> 03:29:45.180]  Reflections and Warnings available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:29:45.180 --> 03:29:45.640]  Don't wait.
[03:29:45.640 --> 03:29:46.441]  Get them.
[03:29:46.441 --> 03:29:47.161]  Give them to people.
[03:29:51.474 --> 03:29:55.400]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.400 --> 03:29:58.084]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.765 --> 03:30:09.910]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:30:09.910 --> 03:30:13.272]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:30:13.272 --> 03:30:19.135]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:30:19.135 --> 03:30:23.918]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:30:23.918 --> 03:30:26.279]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:30:26.459 --> 03:30:26.859]  Thank you.
[03:30:45.370 --> 03:30:49.095]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.

[03:31:01.363 --> 03:31:04.365]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:31:04.365 --> 03:31:09.689]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:31:09.689 --> 03:31:11.751]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:31:11.751 --> 03:31:16.754]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:31:16.754 --> 03:31:17.935]  How much do you want?
[03:31:17.935 --> 03:31:19.056]  When do you want it?
[03:31:19.056 --> 03:31:20.938]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:31:20.938 --> 03:31:22.018]  When will you need it?
[03:31:22.018 --> 03:31:24.220]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:31:24.220 --> 03:31:25.561]  Will there be any food?
[03:31:25.561 --> 03:31:26.862]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:31:27.062 --> 03:31:32.325]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:31:32.325 --> 03:31:35.927]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:31:35.927 --> 03:31:39.749]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:31:39.749 --> 03:31:40.970]  How much will you need?
[03:31:40.970 --> 03:31:41.870]  We don't know.
[03:31:41.870 --> 03:31:42.971]  How much do you want?
[03:31:42.971 --> 03:31:43.911]  All you can get.
[03:31:43.911 --> 03:31:44.712]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:31:44.992 --> 03:31:48.056]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:31:48.056 --> 03:31:49.818]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:31:49.818 --> 03:31:50.739]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:32:00.330 --> 03:32:04.453]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:32:04.453 --> 03:32:07.335]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:32:07.335 --> 03:32:09.417]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:32:09.417 --> 03:32:11.639]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:32:11.639 --> 03:32:13.300]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:32:13.300 --> 03:32:17.783]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:32:17.783 --> 03:32:20.045]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[03:32:31.130 --> 03:32:33.971]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.

[03:32:36.693 --> 03:32:43.856]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[03:32:48.140 --> 03:32:50.061]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[03:33:33.285 --> 03:33:35.887]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:33:35.887 --> 03:33:36.767]  to 3 p.m.
[03:33:36.767 --> 03:33:40.109]  Central.
[03:33:40.109 --> 03:33:45.331]  We are here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33:45.331 --> 03:33:49.413]  And if you think I'm gonna sit around as the globalists take control of my life,
[03:33:52.145 --> 03:33:56.947]  You got another thing coming!
[03:33:56.947 --> 03:33:59.688]  I understand human potential and our destiny.
[03:33:59.688 --> 03:34:10.812]  Even if the world was overpopulated, the elite should stop suppressing technologies and hoarding them, and we should be exporting excess populations to the stars!
[03:34:10.812 --> 03:34:21.276]  The elite have made the decision to exterminate most of the world's population, all because they don't want you to have access to the life extension technologies.
[03:34:23.826 --> 03:34:32.030]  I don't like them charting the future of the world, and I don't like their responses back to us of, well, the public doesn't care.
[03:34:32.030 --> 03:34:40.213]  They want to play video games and watch UT Longhorns because the establishment has force-fed it down their throats in a feedback loop.
[03:34:40.213 --> 03:34:51.418]  Now, I said earlier I was going to play the Head of Health and Human Services clip where
[03:34:54.619 --> 03:35:06.362]  Kathleen Sebelius is bragging publicly about, oh, our PR campaign and children's television shows and movies to take the swine flu shot is really working.
[03:35:06.362 --> 03:35:08.962]  That is only the tip of the iceberg.
[03:35:08.962 --> 03:35:22.105]  Last week we played clips from Fox News where they brag, Fox TV itself, that they are propagandizing in every TV show, in every movie, in every program for the global carbon tax.
[03:35:23.069 --> 03:35:33.977]  And then you have the White House, going back many White Houses, but it's getting bigger and bigger now, and you have the General Accounting Office stating it's illegal, taking hundreds of billions, hundreds of billions.
[03:35:33.977 --> 03:35:47.587]  I mean, Bush spent $8 billion just on the No Child Left Behind propaganda, and didn't tell you that sitcoms and dramas and radio and newsprint, fiction, nonfiction, was lying and spinning and paid for.
[03:35:49.258 --> 03:35:52.463]  Most TV is now paid for lying propaganda.
[03:35:52.463 --> 03:35:56.869]  I don't know how Jesse Ventura's TV show is going to get on the air if it's actually anti-New World Order.
[03:35:56.869 --> 03:35:58.271]  He swears it is.
[03:35:58.271 --> 03:35:59.112]  I've looked at some of it.
[03:35:59.112 --> 03:36:00.815]  It looks pretty good.
[03:36:00.815 --> 03:36:01.976]  We'll see if that even happens.
[03:36:01.976 --> 03:36:04.980]  That was him hinting last week that it may not even make it on the air.
[03:36:06.172 --> 03:36:09.773]  Fox admits to planting political brainwashing in popular TV shows.
[03:36:09.773 --> 03:36:12.253]  Perhaps we should cue this up, too.
[03:36:12.253 --> 03:36:12.993]  See, here's the problem.
[03:36:12.993 --> 03:36:17.394]  I don't want to just play a couple clips here and then make you think I'm putting on all my evidence.
[03:36:17.394 --> 03:36:21.975]  I have hundreds of clips, not just where they're admitting it, but where they're engaging in it.
[03:36:21.975 --> 03:36:28.036]  Suddenly, Al Gore is on half the dramas and TV shows and Saturday Night Live is the priest, the savior.
[03:36:28.036 --> 03:36:31.297]  If you don't go for the global carbon tax, you want to kill Africans?
[03:36:31.297 --> 03:36:35.298]  When it's the globalists that are actually implanting the vaccines with the HIV?
[03:36:36.687 --> 03:36:40.714]  And their argument is, well, if we don't kill them, they'll be even more suffering.
[03:36:40.714 --> 03:36:48.268]  Then it comes out in the Times of London, the world's rich secretly meet to discuss population reduction.
[03:36:50.103 --> 03:37:03.495]  And it is disgusting how the general public hears this and has an automatic denial program implanted in their mind to just say, none of it exists, none of it exists, when I'm here telling you the secrets of the world.
[03:37:03.495 --> 03:37:06.898]  I'm here telling you what's really going on in the controller's minds.
[03:37:06.898 --> 03:37:08.279]  I'm reading their documents.
[03:37:08.279 --> 03:37:09.480]  I spend the time.
[03:37:09.480 --> 03:37:17.467]  I'm here telling you that a horrible nightmare is being set up by a bunch of true believers.
[03:37:17.467 --> 03:37:17.587]  And
[03:37:18.612 --> 03:37:28.560]  Their argument is almost proven by the fact that you want to be killed, you want to drink sodium fluoride.
[03:37:28.560 --> 03:37:39.889]  Hundreds of chemicals they put in your water to give you cancer and sterilize your butt, and do you see people marching on the City Hall of Austin, Texas, where I have probably 100,000 plus fans and listeners?
[03:37:39.889 --> 03:37:40.049]  No!
[03:37:41.869 --> 03:37:47.393]  I would have to beat the drum for a month to get 10,000 people to go down there and have them ignore us.
[03:37:47.393 --> 03:37:48.715]  It needs to be every day.
[03:37:48.715 --> 03:37:50.416]  It needs to be 100,000 of you.
[03:37:50.416 --> 03:37:54.939]  And it's the same for other places around the country.
[03:37:54.939 --> 03:37:59.723]  We have got to prove to the elite that we are part of the decision-making process.
[03:37:59.723 --> 03:38:04.107]  Because in their weird psychology, they say, hey, we've told you what we're doing.
[03:38:04.107 --> 03:38:05.188]  You don't care.
[03:38:05.188 --> 03:38:08.130]  Therefore, it's fair game.
[03:38:08.130 --> 03:38:09.111]  There's another issue, too.
[03:38:11.795 --> 03:38:16.277]  Globalists are always saying, join us, join us, join us.
[03:38:16.277 --> 03:38:21.979]  If I've been approached 50 times, I bet Ron Paul's been approached 500 times.
[03:38:21.979 --> 03:38:28.502]  I've been taken up on the mountain many times and offered great power, but it means nothing because I know it's evil at its core.
[03:38:28.502 --> 03:38:29.862]  I'm not delusional.
[03:38:29.862 --> 03:38:32.543]  I know it stinks.
[03:38:32.543 --> 03:38:37.945]  My scam meter goes off the chart just looking at Al Gore, much less understanding him and researching him.
[03:38:37.945 --> 03:38:39.626]  That just verifies what I already knew.
[03:38:45.350 --> 03:38:49.574]  But they have this weird rule where they've got to tell you what they're going to do to you.
[03:38:49.574 --> 03:38:50.695]  It's like fair game.
[03:38:50.695 --> 03:38:53.298]  It's like they're saying, prepare for battle.
[03:38:53.298 --> 03:39:01.266]  It's like you're in a ring with a shield and a sword, and they hit their sword and shield together and say, on guard!
[03:39:01.266 --> 03:39:01.867]  On guard!
[03:39:01.867 --> 03:39:02.807]  Get on guard!
[03:39:02.807 --> 03:39:03.808]  I'm going to kill you!
[03:39:05.353 --> 03:39:06.474]  I mean, they're gentlemen.
[03:39:06.474 --> 03:39:08.996]  They say, on guard, I'm going to kill you.
[03:39:08.996 --> 03:39:13.198]  On guard, I'm going to build a technological police state grid, and then we're going to kill you.
[03:39:13.198 --> 03:39:17.141]  Do you see all our police massing around you, brainwashed and ready for blood?
[03:39:17.141 --> 03:39:18.482]  Do you see all the surveillance?
[03:39:18.482 --> 03:39:20.623]  Do you see how we're imploding your economy?
[03:39:20.623 --> 03:39:21.924]  On guard!
[03:39:21.924 --> 03:39:22.405]  On guard!
[03:39:22.405 --> 03:39:25.627]  And the public's like, cheeseburger, I like it.
[03:39:25.627 --> 03:39:28.149]  You know, just like, that Alex Jones is a nut!
[03:39:29.107 --> 03:39:30.847]  And I'm going, they're staying on guard!
[03:39:30.847 --> 03:39:31.648]  They're staying on guard!
[03:39:31.648 --> 03:39:32.508]  They're attacking!
[03:39:32.508 --> 03:39:33.068]  They're attacking!
[03:39:33.068 --> 03:39:39.110]  My God, they just gave 45% of the women in this country, in one African country, HIV!
[03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:41.650]  My God, these people are devastators!
[03:39:41.650 --> 03:39:44.471]  And the general public's like, did you hear about the UT horns?
[03:39:44.471 --> 03:39:46.551]  Did you hear about the Winter Olympics coming up?
[03:39:46.551 --> 03:39:48.592]  And I'm like, yeah, that's real neat.
[03:39:48.592 --> 03:39:50.412]  I understand the UT horns.
[03:39:50.412 --> 03:39:53.673]  You should drop everything you're doing to fight these people.
[03:39:53.673 --> 03:39:55.254]  To speak out against them.
[03:39:55.254 --> 03:39:56.734]  To at least address them.
[03:39:57.054 --> 03:40:04.361]  If you can't even address them with real evidence, then they say that's proof that you're subhuman and deserve to die.
[03:40:04.361 --> 03:40:11.969]  If you can't even man up and face the situation we're in and address the elite, they won't even talk to you.
[03:40:11.969 --> 03:40:14.351]  They think it's cute and funny I'm on the air.
[03:40:14.351 --> 03:40:16.774]  They think it's cute and funny I'm here warning you.
[03:40:16.774 --> 03:40:19.677]  Because they think you're dogs and that you're not gonna wake up.
[03:40:21.038 --> 03:40:25.801]  And they say if you did wake up and actually addressed them, then they might do something else.
[03:40:25.801 --> 03:40:26.922]  But I know their nature.
[03:40:26.922 --> 03:40:27.862]  That's not really the case.
[03:40:27.862 --> 03:40:28.763]  It's like a little game.
[03:40:28.763 --> 03:40:34.666]  All right, let's play some of these clips and go to some final calls here for people that are holding a mic.
[03:40:34.666 --> 03:40:36.468]  Elizabeth, John, Lamont, and Jason.
[03:40:36.468 --> 03:40:37.328]  But I'm going to go to your calls.
[03:40:37.328 --> 03:40:38.109]  You got to go quickly.
[03:40:38.109 --> 03:40:43.432]  The first clip is the Health and Human Services Secretary bragging about how great the propaganda is going.
[03:40:44.758 --> 03:40:51.322]  And the White House now admits they're propagandizing on global warming, on anti-gun, this is all going on right now.
[03:40:51.322 --> 03:40:59.527]  You need to be aware, this isn't a free or healthy society when your tax money is used to take over TV, radio, and media.
[03:40:59.527 --> 03:41:04.930]  Here it is.
[03:41:04.930 --> 03:41:06.431]  In just a moment.
[03:41:06.431 --> 03:41:07.572]  Here it is, it's loading now.
[03:41:08.916 --> 03:41:11.818]  For the latest news on H1N1, go to vactruth.com.
[03:41:11.818 --> 03:41:13.318]  That's who posted this.
[03:41:30.928 --> 03:41:31.029]  Yes.
[03:41:46.412 --> 03:41:51.116]  Results also with state and local partners, tribal partners, private sector.
[03:41:51.116 --> 03:41:55.660]  Finally, Mr. Chair, we are continuing to focus on mitigation.
[03:41:55.660 --> 03:41:59.884]  In the meantime, there's still some fairly simple steps that people need to take.
[03:41:59.884 --> 03:42:08.251]  Social isolation, staying home when you're sick, washing hands, coughing and sneezing into arms.
[03:42:08.251 --> 03:42:13.696]  I've been very impressed that children are listening to Elmo and they are correcting their parents in terms of
[03:42:15.277 --> 03:42:17.098]  Sneeze technique.
[03:42:17.098 --> 03:42:25.001]  And we are doing everything we can think of with our partners in terms of the communication effort.
[03:42:25.001 --> 03:42:40.609]  Not only using traditional media, but we have great partners in Sesame Street, in Sid the Science Kid, where the Secretary and I will launch a new program today, Facebook, Twitter, ESPN that runs the
[03:42:41.489 --> 03:42:42.830]  Okay, now that was Kathleen Sebelius.
[03:43:11.465 --> 03:43:15.729]  Who I guess had a stye, so she was like one-eyed like Sauron.
[03:43:15.729 --> 03:43:17.190]  They're staring out at people.
[03:43:17.190 --> 03:43:19.112]  Did you catch it?
[03:43:19.112 --> 03:43:27.138]  Not only are they admitting they're brainwashing your children, we're gonna play one of those clips right now from PBS, paid for by the government.
[03:43:27.138 --> 03:43:30.361]  Do you notice she said the young children are correcting their parents.
[03:43:30.361 --> 03:43:35.325]  Remember Al Gore and all these middle school, high school, and elementary school speeches?
[03:43:35.325 --> 03:43:37.928]  He says, correct your parents, they're wrong.
[03:43:39.212 --> 03:43:45.755]  And then the New York Times had those articles where the seven-year-old writes fake tickets to their parents.
[03:43:45.755 --> 03:43:51.958]  And now at schools in the US, UK, and Canada, they give them little ticket books to write their parents up.
[03:43:51.958 --> 03:43:55.400]  This is how they're inducting us into the 1984 society.
[03:43:55.400 --> 03:43:58.921]  The state is taking over your children right in front of you.
[03:43:58.921 --> 03:44:04.044]  That is absolute, total tyranny you just saw.
[03:44:04.044 --> 03:44:05.825]  That should enrage all of you.
[03:44:06.786 --> 03:44:09.648]  You should have all your children out of public schools immediately.
[03:44:09.648 --> 03:44:11.769]  You shouldn't be letting them watch television.
[03:44:11.769 --> 03:44:18.313]  The state is taking over the family and telling your children to tell you what to do!
[03:44:18.313 --> 03:44:24.157]  It doesn't get more Nazi or Soviet or Maoist or Hitlerian than that!
[03:44:24.157 --> 03:44:30.461]  Now, here's one of the brainwashing programs she mentioned, and notice the nurse laughs when she goes,
[03:44:31.744 --> 03:44:35.066]  It'll hurt a little, but it'll help a lot.
[03:44:35.066 --> 03:44:36.046]  They're even letting you know.
[03:44:36.046 --> 03:44:38.367]  The sterilization.
[03:44:38.367 --> 03:44:39.588]  Because there's too many of you.
[03:44:39.588 --> 03:44:42.870]  It may hurt a little, but it'll help a lot.
[03:44:42.870 --> 03:44:45.151]  Here it is.
[03:44:45.151 --> 03:44:47.652]  Stopping that virus, that's our goal.
[03:44:47.652 --> 03:44:50.394]  So come on everybody, we're getting the shot.
[03:44:50.394 --> 03:44:51.854]  It might hurt a little bit.
[03:44:51.854 --> 03:44:52.935]  Just a little bit.
[03:44:52.935 --> 03:44:54.956]  But it's gonna help a whole lot.
[03:44:54.956 --> 03:44:58.998]  This vaccination is a great opportunity.
[03:45:07.861 --> 03:45:10.222]  This won't spread if we don't let it.
[03:45:10.222 --> 03:45:15.864]  So roll up your sleeves and come and get it!
[03:45:15.864 --> 03:45:18.305]  If I don't get the virus, I won't give it to you.
[03:45:18.305 --> 03:45:20.966]  If you don't give it to me, I won't give it to her.
[03:45:20.966 --> 03:45:23.987]  If I don't get it from her, I won't give it to them.
[03:45:23.987 --> 03:45:25.667]  That's true!
[03:45:25.667 --> 03:45:30.129]  And I won't be able to have children either!
[03:45:30.129 --> 03:45:32.950]  Children dying of cancer, so much fun!
[03:45:32.950 --> 03:45:35.931]  Take the euthanization shot, slow kill, yeah!
[03:45:39.368 --> 03:45:52.893]  Let's stop right there.
[03:45:52.893 --> 03:45:53.954]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[03:45:53.954 --> 03:45:56.175]  Now, I'm gonna explain to you mammal psychology.
[03:45:56.175 --> 03:45:59.656]  They study dog training under Pavlov, the Russian.
[03:45:59.656 --> 03:46:06.198]  Humans keep dogs more often than cats because we're most similar to dogs in our pack psychology.
[03:46:06.198 --> 03:46:07.399]  Now, he's the little one.
[03:46:09.485 --> 03:46:11.047]  He's the little one.
[03:46:11.047 --> 03:46:12.168]  He's the littlest one.
[03:46:12.168 --> 03:46:18.074]  And remember, when you're 5, you look up to the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 year olds.
[03:46:18.074 --> 03:46:30.488]  And so they all dance first, and then he dances at the end, and everyone turns and gives him attention, and he goes up the chain in the pack towards alpha male.
[03:46:32.148 --> 03:46:35.690]  And so the message is, you'll be popular if you take this shot.
[03:46:35.690 --> 03:46:40.414]  All psych warfare by the Pentagon, brainwashing your children.
[03:46:40.414 --> 03:46:43.135]  Here it is, the savage manipulation.
[03:46:43.135 --> 03:46:47.739]  So the little puppy sees the bigger dogs in the pack that he admires.
[03:46:48.519 --> 03:46:54.323]  When he says, I'm going to get the shot, they all suddenly turn and go, ah, and he's the center of everything.
[03:46:54.323 --> 03:46:56.204]  Oh, God, bring me the brain damage.
[03:46:56.204 --> 03:46:57.485]  Bring me the sterilization.
[03:46:57.485 --> 03:46:58.846]  Bring me the cancer.
[03:46:58.846 --> 03:47:00.587]  Oh, God, sterilize me.
[03:47:00.587 --> 03:47:06.051]  It might hurt a little, but it's going to help a lot, like the White House science czar says, sterilizing him.
[03:47:06.051 --> 03:47:08.333]  Let's show him getting sterilized right here.
[03:47:08.333 --> 03:47:09.854]  He's a good member of the pack.
[03:47:09.854 --> 03:47:12.996]  He joins the military like all the TV shows brainwashing kids.
[03:47:12.996 --> 03:47:13.597]  G.I.
[03:47:13.597 --> 03:47:15.438]  Joe, great American hero.
[03:47:15.438 --> 03:47:16.318]  Go, Joe!
[03:47:16.318 --> 03:47:16.739]  Here it is.
[03:47:30.913 --> 03:47:40.039]  This is totally sick.
[03:47:40.039 --> 03:47:43.061]  Let's go out to break and I'll come back and take a few final calls.
[03:47:43.061 --> 03:47:44.942]  Let's go out to break with
[03:47:47.489 --> 03:48:00.678]  The parent company, News Corp, they released this on MySpace and TV, bragging that they're brainwashing you, that global warming's man-made, and we need to do something about it, with all this fear.
[03:48:00.678 --> 03:48:10.365]  And then meanwhile, Fox TV criticizes Ron Paul and other people, and Cavuto and others are kind of sideways on whether it's real or not.
[03:48:10.365 --> 03:48:14.768]  But then their publications say, don't worry, it's not gonna pass, so you stand down.
[03:48:14.768 --> 03:48:15.689]  Let's go to the next level.
[03:48:16.658 --> 03:48:17.719]  Oh, we're queuing it up right now?
[03:48:17.719 --> 03:48:23.443]  Yeah, if people want to find it, it's Fox Admits to Planting Political Brainwashing in Popular TV Shows.
[03:48:23.443 --> 03:48:26.005]  This is from March 6th of this year.
[03:48:26.005 --> 03:48:29.948]  But I really think this illustrates things well for people.
[03:48:29.948 --> 03:48:34.771]  Oh, you guys didn't know we were going to that?
[03:48:34.771 --> 03:48:35.772]  Okay.
[03:48:35.772 --> 03:48:38.474]  Sometimes these web videos... Alright, here we go.
[03:48:38.474 --> 03:48:40.356]  We'll go out to break with it and come back with the rest of it.
[03:48:40.356 --> 03:48:40.636]  Here it is.
[03:48:44.930 --> 03:48:57.798]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[03:48:57.798 --> 03:48:58.778]  I'd say we're on record.
[03:48:58.778 --> 03:49:00.840]  Global warming.
[03:49:00.840 --> 03:49:01.660]  Probably.
[03:49:01.660 --> 03:49:05.683]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[03:49:08.050 --> 03:49:10.612]  Three years is a long ways away.
[03:49:10.612 --> 03:49:15.636]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[03:49:15.636 --> 03:49:17.797]  Just had another thought.
[03:49:17.797 --> 03:49:21.200]  What if the Scared Straight Show had a green message to it?
[03:49:21.200 --> 03:49:29.346]  The biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into some of our content.
[03:49:29.346 --> 03:49:30.667]  I don't follow.
[03:49:30.667 --> 03:49:32.929]  Green, it means environmentally friendly.
[03:49:33.029 --> 03:49:40.473]  The lifeblood of our company is the quality of our TV shows and we would accomplish nothing if we compromise that quality.
[03:49:40.473 --> 03:49:43.974]  Going green doesn't fit with the rest of the show.
[03:49:43.974 --> 03:49:45.535]  We're working magic, make it fit.
[03:49:45.535 --> 03:49:49.357]  Hey Brian, I'm not going to recycle this aluminum can, I'm just going to throw it in the trash.
[03:49:53.232 --> 03:50:15.065]  The most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production, as well as work in a message about global warming, about environmental changes, and about empowering people to take responsibility.
[03:50:15.065 --> 03:50:17.046]  Why are your wedding programs bumpy?
[03:50:19.031 --> 03:50:27.077]  We're having a green wedding, so after the reception our guests can plant the programs, grow flowers.
[03:50:27.077 --> 03:50:30.119]  I could live in the sea and make friends with a whale.
[03:50:30.119 --> 03:50:32.321]  We'd live in a sunken pirate ship.
[03:50:32.321 --> 03:50:33.942]  That'd show global warming.
[03:50:33.942 --> 03:50:38.345]  We've come up with all sorts of strategies for lessening our footprint.
[03:50:38.345 --> 03:50:43.970]  Everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles on our production.
[03:50:43.970 --> 03:50:45.331]  Look at all these Hummers.
[03:50:45.331 --> 03:50:46.952]  What kind of jerk would drive one of those?
[03:50:48.786 --> 03:50:52.987]  Dude, this car kicks ass!
[03:50:52.987 --> 03:50:54.668]  Yeah, Rumsfeld!
[03:50:54.668 --> 03:51:01.831]  We're using biodiesel.
[03:51:01.831 --> 03:51:03.591]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:51:03.591 --> 03:51:05.112]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:51:05.112 --> 03:51:06.432]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:51:06.432 --> 03:51:08.373]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:51:08.373 --> 03:51:17.076]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:51:17.176 --> 03:51:22.580]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:51:22.580 --> 03:51:24.381]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:51:24.381 --> 03:51:31.867]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[03:51:31.867 --> 03:51:36.050]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[03:51:36.050 --> 03:51:38.572]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[03:51:38.772 --> 03:51:43.755]  Liquid Zeolite comes with a money-back guarantee, but it's only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:06.956]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.956 --> 03:52:10.221]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.221 --> 03:52:11.623]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.327 --> 03:52:15.008]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.008 --> 03:52:21.389]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.389 --> 03:52:26.571]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[03:52:26.571 --> 03:52:29.851]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:52:29.851 --> 03:52:36.573]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.693 --> 03:52:39.035]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.035 --> 03:52:40.637]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.637 --> 03:52:43.079]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.079 --> 03:52:45.221]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.221 --> 03:52:50.366]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.366 --> 03:52:59.475]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:01.604 --> 03:53:02.804]  The once mighty U.S.
[03:53:02.804 --> 03:53:05.825]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[03:53:05.825 --> 03:53:08.506]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[03:53:08.506 --> 03:53:11.687]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[03:53:11.687 --> 03:53:15.949]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[03:53:15.949 --> 03:53:24.072]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders, and Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[03:53:24.072 --> 03:53:24.792]  Prepare now.
[03:53:25.452 --> 03:53:30.255]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[03:53:30.255 --> 03:53:35.759]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[03:53:35.759 --> 03:53:40.542]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[03:53:40.542 --> 03:53:42.744]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[03:53:42.744 --> 03:53:46.186]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you free of charge.
[03:53:46.186 --> 03:53:46.546]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[03:53:49.068 --> 03:53:50.469]  Look, we're basically out of time.
[03:53:50.469 --> 03:53:52.891]  I'm going to try to jam in Mike and Elizabeth.
[03:53:52.891 --> 03:53:54.071]  I got John, Lamont, Jason.
[03:53:54.071 --> 03:53:55.132]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:53:55.132 --> 03:53:55.953]  I'll get you on.
[03:53:55.953 --> 03:53:58.775]  But Mike and Elizabeth, I'm going to try to go to you here in a moment.
[03:54:14.738 --> 03:54:17.219]  Want to thank a few of the sponsors today.
[03:54:17.219 --> 03:54:19.380]  FrontSight.com.
[03:54:19.380 --> 03:54:23.962]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder of FrontSight Firearms Training Institute?
[03:54:23.962 --> 03:54:28.043]  He's offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[03:54:28.043 --> 03:54:35.166]  Five days of world-class gun training at the FrontSight Firearms Training Institute and a secured 30-state weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[03:54:35.166 --> 03:54:39.708]  Act fast and they'll give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:54:39.708 --> 03:54:43.810]  They got two-day, four-day, five-day courses and a lot of free stuff online as well at FrontSight.
[03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:49.140]  Like the front of your rifle, FrontSight.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:51.812 --> 03:54:53.994]  Also, look, I'm not going to belabor this.
[03:54:53.994 --> 03:54:59.518]  Ted Anderson is selling out of the gold he bought at the $1,000 level with it above $1,140.
[03:54:59.518 --> 03:55:01.599]  He's selling out of this.
[03:55:01.599 --> 03:55:02.720]  It's done tonight.
[03:55:02.720 --> 03:55:03.420]  Give him a call.
[03:55:03.420 --> 03:55:04.001]  800-686-2237.
[03:55:04.001 --> 03:55:06.022]  800-686-2237.
[03:55:06.022 --> 03:55:10.766]  He's never offered a deal.
[03:55:10.766 --> 03:55:11.867]  Never has it been this good.
[03:55:11.867 --> 03:55:13.007]  He's had a lot of great deals.
[03:55:13.007 --> 03:55:14.468]  This is the best.
[03:55:14.468 --> 03:55:16.010]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Michigan.
[03:55:16.010 --> 03:55:17.891]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:55:17.891 --> 03:55:18.872]  Alex.
[03:55:18.872 --> 03:55:19.172]  Hey, buddy.
[03:55:20.071 --> 03:55:31.834]  Yeah, listen, I love your radio show and all the work you do, and I love people like Officer Jack McLam and Dr. Deagle, but buddy, you got my blood pressure up today.
[03:55:31.834 --> 03:55:45.977]  I can turn on CNN, Fox News, or listen to Glenn Beck if I want to listen to New World Order horse crap, but when I turn your program on, I don't want to hear some gutter rat promoting New World Order's satanic agenda.
[03:55:46.471 --> 03:55:54.876]  Like I say, I'm not here to chew your rear end, I love you, I love what you're doing, but we do not want to hear some gutter rat promoting this trash.
[03:55:54.876 --> 03:55:58.238]  Let me be clear with you, Mike, and just hold your horses for a minute.
[03:55:58.238 --> 03:56:10.345]  I disagreed with him, and I saw him on national TV admit the New World Order takeover, and so I didn't really know who this guy was, I'd seen him on TV a few times, so I got him on and we learned a lot.
[03:56:10.785 --> 03:56:14.706]  And a lot of people that are in denial about this stuff are now gonna awaken.
[03:56:14.706 --> 03:56:17.207]  If I could get Henry Kissinger on, I would.
[03:56:17.207 --> 03:56:19.287]  If I could get David Rockefeller on, I would.
[03:56:19.287 --> 03:56:24.348]  I don't think this guy is consciously, you know, doing the things they're doing.
[03:56:24.348 --> 03:56:26.429]  But, I mean, I think it was very informative.
[03:56:26.429 --> 03:56:30.210]  This is not just some religious cult where it's only one view.
[03:56:30.210 --> 03:56:34.051]  I have people on here that I disagree with a lot.
[03:56:34.791 --> 03:56:40.175]  And I didn't know that all that was going to happen when he was on with us, but I will tell you I plan on having him back on.
[03:56:40.175 --> 03:56:43.277]  I mean, Mike, give me a little bit of credit that I might know what I'm doing here.
[03:56:43.277 --> 03:56:46.199]  I mean, I saw the guy on TV and said, wow, let's get that guy on.
[03:56:46.199 --> 03:56:46.700]  We call.
[03:56:46.700 --> 03:56:50.042]  He knows who I am, which shows they're listening.
[03:56:50.042 --> 03:56:51.943]  And we got him on the show.
[03:56:51.943 --> 03:56:55.746]  And so, I mean, I think it was very positive.
[03:56:55.746 --> 03:56:59.169]  You don't normally hear that on mainstream television.
[03:56:59.169 --> 03:57:02.351]  I mean, so you're saying it wasn't informative to have him on?
[03:57:03.018 --> 03:57:10.923]  No, it's that he's promoting his agenda and, you know, it's like I want to hear you and hear what you got to say.
[03:57:10.923 --> 03:57:13.185]  And like I said, I love your show and I love your work.
[03:57:13.769 --> 03:57:17.591]  But it's like, you know, I feel like, you know, it's like having Glenn Beck on.
[03:57:17.591 --> 03:57:19.472]  What do we need to hear that trash for?
[03:57:19.472 --> 03:57:21.354]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:57:21.354 --> 03:57:23.335]  I would have Glenn Beck on in a minute.
[03:57:23.335 --> 03:57:24.516]  Let's try to get Glenn Beck again.
[03:57:24.516 --> 03:57:28.658]  I'd love to have him on and ask why he stabs Ron Paul in the back.
[03:57:28.658 --> 03:57:29.418]  I mean, come on.
[03:57:29.418 --> 03:57:33.101]  Mike, I hear what you're saying, but I respectfully disagree with you.
[03:57:33.101 --> 03:57:35.462]  And I would love to have, I've tried to get Rothkopf back on.
[03:57:35.462 --> 03:57:36.183]  He won't come on now.
[03:57:37.183 --> 03:57:39.104]  And I want to get Holbrook on.
[03:57:39.104 --> 03:57:41.286]  I mean, I want to get all these people on.
[03:57:41.286 --> 03:57:45.929]  I didn't exactly know where that guy was going to go with all that, but that was a pleasant surprise getting to see all that revealed.
[03:57:45.929 --> 03:57:52.433]  You know, we get to hear about Nick Rockefeller saying things to Aaron Russo, but it's one thing to hear about, another thing to hear directly from him.
[03:57:52.433 --> 03:57:55.815]  But that guy's a true believer.
[03:57:55.815 --> 03:57:58.497]  Elizabeth in Tennessee, you got about 30 seconds, go ahead.
[03:58:00.925 --> 03:58:01.545]  Alex?
[03:58:01.545 --> 03:58:02.566]  Yes, Elizabeth, welcome.
[03:58:02.566 --> 03:58:03.706]  Hey!
[03:58:03.706 --> 03:58:05.787]  I'm so glad to be on with you.
[03:58:05.787 --> 03:58:07.708]  I do give you a lot of credit, Alex.
[03:58:07.708 --> 03:58:10.769]  I appreciate you so much and pray for you and your family.
[03:58:10.769 --> 03:58:17.112]  I just also wanted to take exception with what Damon Vickers had to say.
[03:58:17.112 --> 03:58:21.574]  His perception of Americans as being fat and lazy and sitting in our armchair.
[03:58:21.574 --> 03:58:27.517]  I just wanted to say that Americans have worked real hard to have the prosperity
[03:58:27.717 --> 03:58:28.458]  I'm out of time.
[03:58:28.458 --> 03:58:29.038]  Call me back.
[03:58:29.038 --> 03:58:30.860]  We'll no doubt discuss him tomorrow.
[03:58:30.860 --> 03:58:33.423]  I think he was talking about a subset of people.
[03:58:33.423 --> 03:58:36.666]  Obviously, we've got some of the hardest working, smartest, best people in the world.
[03:58:36.666 --> 03:58:37.787]  We've got to save that.
[03:58:37.787 --> 03:58:38.587]  Great job, crew.
