[00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.123]  Yeah.
[00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:28.687]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, we're now eight minutes into this second hour, and for the rest of the hour, in studio, I am joined by director and filmmaker Philip Klein.
[00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:36.330]  He's made some other award-winning films in the past, but his new film is Begging for Billionaires, the attack on property rights in America.
[00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.811]  And for those that don't know, this isn't just eminent domain.
[00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:48.396]  They now, on the Supreme Court ruling, can say if a private interest can lobby and pay money to state and local governments, open bribes, bribes are legal according to the Supreme Court,
[00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:55.684]  And that they can then take your property, and in many cases, if you refuse to sell, they don't just take it, they then charge you attorney bills.
[00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:58.827]  So, you're paying to have your land stolen and under...
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.042]  Taxpayer Property owner Bill of Rights in Texas.
[00:01:03.142 --> 00:01:11.288]  We've all my family got a letter from the state saying if we want to do something to your property or buy it or take it or put a pipeline across it or Build something on it.
[00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:15.711]  You got a few months To accept our deal or we'll just basically take it.
[00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:24.536]  This is the new America and He is the official selection for quite a few big film festivals, Minneapolis, St.
[00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:29.420]  Paul Best of the festival International Film Festival official selection
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.881]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[00:01:55.012 --> 00:01:55.953]  It's good to have you here.
[00:01:56.293 --> 00:02:01.916]  So tell the listeners a little bit about how you made this film, why you got involved in it, and about the film itself.
[00:02:02.016 --> 00:02:07.960]  Well, I got involved with this film because a good friend of mine was losing his property for the second time.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.544]  I mean, he's gone through about 40 years of threats of eminent domain, and this one was really a threat.
[00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:15.525]  It was real.
[00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:20.908]  And I decided, being a filmmaker, to document his process.
[00:02:21.388 --> 00:02:23.168]  And his struggle trying to keep his property.
[00:02:23.228 --> 00:02:30.150]  We also had five other families both in Sugar Creek and of St.
[00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.811]  Louis, Arnold, Missouri and another couple areas.
[00:02:35.252 --> 00:02:42.913]  And we spent four years following their struggle and their anguish and their story.
[00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:48.835]  And I think that's very important for people to see their story and actually see the
[00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:53.147]  The turmoil, they're losing their property, they're losing their memories.
[00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.168]  You know, it's not just about the brick and mortar.
[00:02:55.468 --> 00:02:59.150]  It's about the memories and the things in the house.
[00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.812]  Well, it was Stalin, the evil genius that he was, that said, you know, one death is a tragedy.
[00:03:05.212 --> 00:03:06.973]  Ten thousand deaths is a statistic.
[00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:10.635]  So by going in and personalizing, I've done that on the radio, but not like film can do.
[00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:16.498]  These families in New London, Connecticut, you know, as an example, they would,
[00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:17.958]  I don't know.
[00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:48.078]  They just wanted it.
[00:03:48.438 --> 00:03:48.678]  Yeah.
[00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.360]  And they tore down all those homes and businesses and it's sitting empty.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.281]  And this happened in Kansas City with the Glover Plan.
[00:03:55.541 --> 00:04:01.943]  It said for eight years they tore down all the homes and businesses until we threatened to turn them in for bond fraud.
[00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:04.664]  Because they were using the bond money.
[00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:07.445]  I haven't seen your film yet, but I know it's gotten rave reviews.
[00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:08.965]  I've been so busy, it just came in a few days ago.
[00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:23.421]  We interviewed Gore Seafood down in Texas there since World War II, $15 million profit a year, and the heir to Mobil wanted it for a yacht parking lot and was trying to take it last time I talked to him.
[00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:24.822]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:04:25.402 --> 00:04:26.342]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:04:26.382 --> 00:04:35.985]  What's interesting about the documentary is we went in and we exposed the collusion between the developers and the politicians.
[00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:39.567]  And there are little backroom deals and all.
[00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:58.858]  And basically what it is, is the politicians basically would, developers, would come to the politicians and saying, we want a certain block or ten blocks or whatever it is, which they've cruised around neighborhoods, especially where they're really targeting is low-income areas.
[00:04:58.878 --> 00:04:59.779]  Because they can't fight back.
[00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:02.476]  Minority areas.
[00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:06.437]  But they've kind of run through a lot of those snacks, though.
[00:05:06.677 --> 00:05:08.277]  They're even going after wealthy people now.
[00:05:08.297 --> 00:05:09.438]  Yeah.
[00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:17.020]  And what's interesting is that the politicians basically have a sign on their front lawn, we can be bought.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:40.430]  You know, and for those that don't know, the Supreme Court ruling said that people can give money politically to counties and cities and states to have them take other people's property, and in the case of New London, Connecticut, if you fight it, they then don't just take your property and condemn it with no money, they then charge you lawyer bills for you fighting it.
[00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.470]  I mean, this is a...
[00:05:42.771 --> 00:05:44.031]  People got mad in the U.S.
[00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:45.792]  thinking they were just taking it for eminent domain.
[00:05:46.052 --> 00:05:53.094]  They didn't know that this is where they rob you, and then you've got to pay a fine to them because they robbed you.
[00:05:53.334 --> 00:06:01.977]  Kind of like when Monsanto, their genetics gets into your crops, you can prove you didn't steal their seeds, then they've contaminated you, but they own the St.
[00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:07.058]  Louis Federal Court, and so that's the one court nationwide it goes to, and so they always rule for them.
[00:06:07.138 --> 00:06:08.719]  They contaminate you, and then
[00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.320]  And then you've got to pay them for being contaminated.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:21.525]  But it's interesting, if you don't want to move, and a good example is Darrell Penner, what they did to Penner is they turned off his electricity, which is illegal.
[00:06:21.545 --> 00:06:23.406]  Tell folks where he was located.
[00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:24.227]  Tell them the background on that.
[00:06:24.987 --> 00:06:27.189]  He was on Maine since the early 1940s.
[00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:40.960]  This is like the second generation of a tuxedo rental place and what's funny about it is the same politicians that took his property rent tuxedos from him because it's right down from City Hall.
[00:06:42.342 --> 00:06:55.877]  And they turned off his electricity, his power, they put a fence around his property, and then they finally, to force him out, blocked off the street, cutting off his customers coming so he had no choice but to move.
[00:06:56.898 --> 00:06:58.059]  I mean, that's terrorism!
[00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:04.924]  Yeah, and they use, oh by the way, they also use code enforcement with police to come in and terrorize them.
[00:07:05.044 --> 00:07:16.453]  Oh no, in Austin they have special code enforcing cops, they're like kept minions, and of course you've seen this around the country, and we always found that the hospitals have a database, it goes to the health department, then they seed this out.
[00:07:16.714 --> 00:07:24.379]  When an old man has cancer, had a heart attack, and they profile him, $2,000 a day fines, Roland Ellingson for a three-inch grass,
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.963]  And the neighbors next door could have four-inch grass.
[00:07:27.983 --> 00:07:28.584]  They didn't care.
[00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:32.568]  The cops would come and fine him, and then if he smarted off, they would arrest him.
[00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.731]  I mean, how do they get... That is so evil.
[00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:40.537]  It's interesting that you brought that up, because in the documentary, we went around to all these politicians.
[00:07:40.797 --> 00:07:43.040]  A tool that they use is called Blight.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.641]  Now, it's a very...
[00:07:46.661 --> 00:08:00.331]  Yeah, but it's interesting, when we took the camera, and we found out being an activist, the camera, and I'll tell the audience this, is the most powerful weapon you have, the politicians can't stand.
[00:08:00.371 --> 00:08:01.491]  It's like a cross to a vampire.
[00:08:02.392 --> 00:08:08.737]  So we went in and interviewed these politicians, and not one of us could tell us what the definition of blight was.
[00:08:09.237 --> 00:08:13.220]  They gave us these half-truth, half-question,
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:15.741]  Explanation.
[00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.022]  They never let you pin them down.
[00:08:17.222 --> 00:08:18.323]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:22.266]  They couldn't pin them down to what blight really meant.
[00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:24.488]  And this is a tool they use.
[00:08:24.548 --> 00:08:38.240]  It could be a gutter off newspapers on your driveway, your grass too high, or maybe some of your... I have seen them saying two planters in an old lady's backyard that had no plants in them.
[00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:40.022]  Just having that was blight.
[00:08:40.442 --> 00:08:40.822]  Wow.
[00:08:41.303 --> 00:08:43.304]  I've seen an old doghouse be blight.
[00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:47.587]  I've seen a creek 20 yards off the property line blocked up with brush.
[00:08:47.907 --> 00:08:48.608]  That's blight.
[00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.129]  And that was my grandparents.
[00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:54.151]  They said, we're going to give you $2,000 a day fines in Austin until you clean that out.
[00:08:54.712 --> 00:08:59.835]  And my grandpa wasn't the type to not think to call people to come do it or to say, no, I don't own that property.
[00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:03.237]  He went back there, did it, had a heart attack, and then that later killed him.
[00:09:03.538 --> 00:09:05.859]  But, you know, so Austin pretty much killed my grandfather.
[00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:07.100]  I mean, they're really nice people.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.301]  The government's great people, yeah.
[00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:14.302]  Well, it's interesting, you know, that what happened in Sugar Creek is another example.
[00:09:14.522 --> 00:09:20.523]  They basically forced all the people out in this whole block except this one woman, Penelope Marsh.
[00:09:21.123 --> 00:09:24.324]  And what happened was, she stayed and they harassed her.
[00:09:24.844 --> 00:09:37.586]  And interesting, she tells this story in the documentary that the guy, head of the redevelopment agency, lived right across the street, was getting a wine tasting business in this new shopping center.
[00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:39.962]  And he was the one pushing it.
[00:09:40.182 --> 00:09:42.163]  I mean, it's... Well, that's what you find in Austin.
[00:09:42.183 --> 00:09:48.387]  They fund malls that are government-paid for, and then the city council people's wives get free shops.
[00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.349]  I mean, it's just crime syndicate.
[00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:56.453]  Yeah, and the funny part is you go to the feds, you go to the law enforcement, they just laugh at you.
[00:09:56.853 --> 00:09:57.654]  Well, they're on the payroll.
[00:09:57.794 --> 00:10:05.459]  Yeah, and it's really shocking to see in this documentary we got Daryl Penner's
[00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:08.600]  A deposition of Whitney Kerr.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:20.224]  Whitney Kerr was the scumbag who goes around basically re-collecting all the properties with phony corporations and stuff so people wouldn't know what was really going on.
[00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:23.806]  And in the deposition he goes to Darryl Penrose's property.
[00:10:24.206 --> 00:10:25.426]  Tell folks where this is again.
[00:10:25.647 --> 00:10:27.927]  This is in downtown Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:10:28.067 --> 00:10:28.368]  Yes.
[00:10:28.888 --> 00:10:34.290]  And he basically says Darryl Penrose's property, the American formal ware, is like amoeba in the body.
[00:10:36.117 --> 00:10:40.600]  It gets sick and wears out and dies and got to be replaced by new amoebas.
[00:10:42.401 --> 00:10:53.288]  And when I heard that in the deposition, I go, God, we got to use that because it was just unbelievable that some of the stuff that... That's what Himmler did!
[00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:56.711]  Yeah, some of the stuff that Whitney Kerr says in this deposition
[00:10:57.549 --> 00:11:00.170]  It's shocking, but it shows how they think.
[00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:06.973]  No, no, take CPS in Texas, they put over two-thirds of the kids on drugs, and they just get up in front of the state and go, these kids all have bad genes.
[00:11:07.713 --> 00:11:09.794]  There's no test for bad, it's all just made up.
[00:11:10.054 --> 00:11:23.320]  But they always say, you're a disease, you're bad, you're like a rat, you're like a vermin, you're a parasite, you've got to be gotten rid of, and the government, it gives us sunshine, it gives us green grass, it is the oxygen.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:31.623]  Well, what's interesting is where Daryl Pena's property went was 30 blocks down the street was H&R Block.
[00:11:32.963 --> 00:11:43.427]  The tax people, who are a Fortune 500 company, took five of Daryl Pena's businesses and four other businesses to build their world headquarters.
[00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:50.609]  Not only did they got the land to build this building, but the city gave them money for all the furnishings.
[00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:51.070]  Stay there.
[00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.570]  Got a break.
[00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.910]  Stay there.
[00:11:55.091 --> 00:12:05.400]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:11.786]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:14.909]  Starve or surrender.
[00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:20.053]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:12:21.456 --> 00:12:22.277]  What then?
[00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:26.264]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:30.732]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:12:30.852 --> 00:12:31.954]  And it's owned by a real person.
[00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.343]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and let's take in a brief mind
[00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:08.309]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:14.135]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:15.997]  The stimulus package is working.
[00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:17.879]  A bailout is coming your way.
[00:13:18.219 --> 00:13:22.143]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[00:13:22.403 --> 00:13:22.724]  Pardon me?
[00:13:23.556 --> 00:13:24.517]  Back to the real world.
[00:13:24.797 --> 00:13:28.740]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.081]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[00:13:31.622 --> 00:13:33.083]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[00:13:33.323 --> 00:13:44.090]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:51.776]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:59.597]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:05.730]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:12.455]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:14:12.695 --> 00:14:14.577]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:14:14.737 --> 00:14:17.139]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:28.008]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:14:30.387 --> 00:14:31.628]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:32.048 --> 00:14:33.449]  It's about a one world government.
[00:14:33.909 --> 00:14:40.252]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:48.577]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:49.077 --> 00:14:50.238]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:50.658 --> 00:14:51.839]  The people strike back.
[00:14:53.635 --> 00:15:00.461]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:15:00.761 --> 00:15:15.875]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all,
[00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:22.118]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:15:22.318 --> 00:15:28.622]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:15:28.842 --> 00:15:32.484]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:35.326]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:15:35.426 --> 00:15:40.789]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:15:41.109 --> 00:15:43.710]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.971]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:48.453]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:15:48.493 --> 00:15:52.835]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:15:52.855 --> 00:16:05.401]  You know, we saw that this film was coming to town.
[00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:06.422]  Rob Doo did.
[00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:15.374]  And so we called the director of this new film, Begging for Billionaires, Philip Klein, and he came into town early to be on the show.
[00:16:15.394 --> 00:16:19.679]  In fact, it turned out he's a listener of the show, so we're flattered to have him here.
[00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:20.820]  He was telling me all the other stuff.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.423]  He's investigating in Kansas City and other parts of the country.
[00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:26.510]  And it all dovetails with my own research.
[00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.112]  So this guy is bonafide from my perspective.
[00:16:30.132 --> 00:16:32.814]  And we're going to play the trailer for the film coming up.
[00:16:32.854 --> 00:16:34.275]  But it's winning a lot of film festivals.
[00:16:35.876 --> 00:16:38.058]  It's definitely going to get a lot of attention.
[00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:39.879]  And I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.
[00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:45.843]  We'll try to buy some in bulk and sell them on the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com because you do personalize it.
[00:16:46.143 --> 00:16:47.464]  This is a short segment.
[00:16:48.284 --> 00:16:52.067]  But we kind of got started on a good foot, but kind of shotgun pattern.
[00:16:52.547 --> 00:17:01.232]  Break down exactly what's going on just in a microcosm of Kansas City, and what this film shows, the fact that you got harassed, attacked, detained, arrested.
[00:17:01.252 --> 00:17:02.913]  I mean, this is hardcore.
[00:17:02.933 --> 00:17:08.877]  Everything you're talking about, I've experienced it personally, and then I've experienced it through nationwide research.
[00:17:08.917 --> 00:17:11.579]  So I want people to know, it's worse than what you're even saying.
[00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:11.879]  Go ahead.
[00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:16.366]  Well, the interesting part is we spent four years making this documentary.
[00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:26.964]  Missouri, by the Institute of Justice, is basically considered as one of the most abusive states in the United States for the abuse of eminent domain, and your property is being attacked.
[00:17:28.314 --> 00:17:31.656]  And not only being attacked, but you really don't own your property.
[00:17:32.037 --> 00:17:37.580]  Someone could come along, decide they want your property, and go to the government.
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:42.003]  And you talk about how they use NGOs, like we have Lower Colorado River Authority here, with its own SWAT teams.
[00:17:42.303 --> 00:17:44.265]  You're mentioning another group, but you don't want to get into them on air.
[00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:47.787]  Exact same system, the North American Union Hub and KC.
[00:17:48.047 --> 00:17:57.073]  Yeah, we're going through that too, but what's interesting is they use tactics, terrorist tactics, and making this documentary, as you mentioned,
[00:17:58.514 --> 00:18:04.777]  Well, the first real shake-up of me was I went to a public hearing that was being held in a hotel.
[00:18:05.978 --> 00:18:15.782]  Mayor Kay Waldo Barnes, an assistant, basically said she didn't want me there, had the police remove me from the hotel, telling me that I could not come in the hotel.
[00:18:15.823 --> 00:18:18.144]  If I came back in the hotel, I would be arrested.
[00:18:18.804 --> 00:18:22.746]  My first cameraman, basically, his vehicle
[00:18:23.516 --> 00:18:29.581]  Parked downtown while we were shooting the redevelopment and carrying the buildings down and all this.
[00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:34.245]  Actually, they trashed, broke all his windows and kicked in the side of the vehicle.
[00:18:34.585 --> 00:18:37.988]  Another time, they almost ran him off the road and killed him.
[00:18:38.708 --> 00:18:41.731]  So, and I was threatened by the mayor's woman.
[00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:46.194]  She had a woman bodyguard who was an off-duty police officer.
[00:18:46.214 --> 00:18:48.076]  This is typical Kansas City police.
[00:18:48.676 --> 00:18:51.359]  Basically, made a threat to me.
[00:18:51.479 --> 00:18:52.560]  Basically, threatened me.
[00:18:53.482 --> 00:18:55.265]  You know, and... What did she say?
[00:18:55.505 --> 00:19:00.792]  She basically said, uh, you still live at 8301 Briar Lane, my old house?
[00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.996]  And I go, yeah, because I thought so.
[00:19:03.888 --> 00:19:06.169]  Basically, it's an indirect threat.
[00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:07.469]  Oh, how's the family doing?
[00:19:07.509 --> 00:19:09.990]  Yeah, it's kind of a mafia threat.
[00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.330]  Yeah, we know where you live.
[00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:23.073]  Even if it's in Kansas, I was living in Kansas at the time, you know, for Kansas City, Missouri police to come into Kansas and find out where I live is really nerve-wracking.
[00:19:23.093 --> 00:19:23.733]  Oh, that happened?
[00:19:24.273 --> 00:19:24.393]  Yeah.
[00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:26.874]  You know, this is big business snatching everybody's property.
[00:19:28.513 --> 00:19:35.595]  And again, with the new London Kilo decision nationwide, they're just taking whatever they want, when they want, in many cases not even paying you for it.
[00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:38.396]  So this isn't the government taking your land and paying you for a highway.
[00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:47.019]  This is, and that's what a lot of these NAFTA highways are about, snatching land on 10 miles of either side and giving it to their select cronies as well.
[00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:47.900]  But keep going.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:49.840]  I don't
[00:20:05.072 --> 00:20:12.562]  And I've seen cases interrupt you, where somebody will be paying two million in taxes on a house or a building, and the government will say, oh, it's worth a hundred grand.
[00:20:12.822 --> 00:20:17.087]  You're like, my tax bill says it's two million, and they go, we have SWAT teams.
[00:20:17.368 --> 00:20:21.473]  And they send these farms and ranches and homes, police, and they just throw you off, but go ahead.
[00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:24.476]  Yeah, and this is the tactics they do.
[00:20:25.397 --> 00:20:35.987]  A case that's not in our documentary, and one of the first imminent cases I worked on, besides the others, was in Merriam, Kansas, was Bill Gross.
[00:20:36.227 --> 00:20:43.153]  He had a used car dealership that he was leasing out to Van Chevrolet, and B&W
[00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:48.880]  Next door, which was run by a bunch of millionaires, wanted his piece of property.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.922]  He wanted a million and a half for the property.
[00:20:50.962 --> 00:20:58.270]  They didn't want to pay it, so they went to Irene French, the mayor, the redevelopment director, and they took his property.
[00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:05.318]  For the next three years, going through court and everything, he had a massive heart attack, and now he's probably in a wheelchair.
[00:21:06.567 --> 00:21:24.204]  Yeah, no, it's very, very stressful, and the way they harass old people when they come out of the hospital, and we know they're using the health department databases, the nurses, oh, the health department, for their safety, I have to report any at risk or hurt, old people or families, and then the health department is feeding that out to their units.
[00:21:24.744 --> 00:21:25.865]  We've confirmed that in Austin.
[00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:28.186]  I mean, this is so sinister.
[00:21:28.346 --> 00:21:30.128]  Oh, these people are disgusting.
[00:21:30.208 --> 00:21:33.630]  Well, and it's also racist, what happened in Richmond Heights.
[00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.290]  Well, we'll stay there.
[00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.511]  Tell us more of the stories when we get back.
[00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:42.075]  And then you were telling me about, and I actually heard about this separate from you, the Kansas City FBI building, an underground complex.
[00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:42.976]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:42.996 --> 00:21:44.257]  Can you talk about that when we get back?
[00:21:44.277 --> 00:21:45.077]  We're on the march.
[00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:47.178]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:50.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:02.673]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:23:02.713 --> 00:23:05.915]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:23:05.955 --> 00:23:08.116]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:23:08.723 --> 00:23:11.167]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:23:11.908 --> 00:23:19.238]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:27.213]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[00:23:35.299 --> 00:23:36.039]  They're not after money.
[00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:37.180]  They have all the money they need.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.061]  They're after power.
[00:23:38.341 --> 00:23:39.201]  That's what happens here.

[00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:09.383]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United States.
[00:24:09.623 --> 00:24:11.084]  What can you do to prepare yourself?
[00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:13.526]  The answer is ZeroFlu.com.

[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:06.851]  His new film, Begging for Billionaires, Limelight Cinema Group presents, the attack on private property rights in America.
[00:25:06.871 --> 00:25:12.399]  Philip Klein, director, executive producer, and it's taken the prize at a lot of big film conferences.
[00:25:15.143 --> 00:25:16.544]  And Film Fest, we're very excited.
[00:25:16.564 --> 00:25:22.127]  It's going to be this Sunday down in New Braunfels, Texas at their big Texas Film Festival.
[00:25:22.168 --> 00:25:27.691]  Down there, it's the main selection film for that, the final film that they'll be showing.
[00:25:27.711 --> 00:25:28.892]  So we'll go over that.
[00:25:29.432 --> 00:25:32.874]  It's won awards in Australia as well.
[00:25:33.335 --> 00:25:40.119]  Okay, Mr. Kline, you know, there's so many points when you and I get in a room together because there's so many facets and areas and so much corruption to go over.
[00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:42.941]  I interrupted you earlier and then I want to play this clip coming up.
[00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:47.163]  Uh, get into H&R Block just what they did alone.
[00:25:47.424 --> 00:25:59.572]  Just like New London, uh, Connecticut, it was a drug company, wanted all this land, uh, you know, 20 times land they needed for a headquarters, and then really they were just going into real estate, so they just had the city just take their land.
[00:25:59.852 --> 00:26:06.136]  The Supreme Court said, yeah, you can just take it, and you can give political contributions to politicians as bribed.
[00:26:06.196 --> 00:26:07.977]  Bribes are now legal to do this.
[00:26:08.017 --> 00:26:10.979]  I mean, this is the mafia taking over America.
[00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:13.541]  So, uh, show folks that photo of the H&R Block headquarters.
[00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:18.224]  The H&R Block headquarters, I don't know which... Hold it up right there, let's go.
[00:26:18.244 --> 00:26:18.564]  Okay.
[00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:31.271]  Headquarters, and they took out five businesses, and not only did they got the land to build this big building, but they also got all the furnishings paid for by the city.
[00:26:31.752 --> 00:26:34.493]  The computers, the desks, everything paid for by the city.
[00:26:34.513 --> 00:26:38.916]  So now they don't just get no taxes, like a lot of cities and counties do, now everything's paid for.
[00:26:39.156 --> 00:26:39.436]  Yeah.
[00:26:39.516 --> 00:26:41.638]  Maybe they can say citizens are slaves and we've got to...
[00:26:42.358 --> 00:26:43.640]  Cut their lawns with scissors!
[00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:52.492]  And then funny was a couple years afterwards the company got in financial trouble and they threw out the CEO of H&R Block.
[00:26:52.893 --> 00:26:57.359]  It was a hostile takeover if you remember on that.
[00:26:57.479 --> 00:26:59.162]  One of our writers and moderators
[00:27:02.413 --> 00:27:06.815]  I believe he said H&R Block was a Century 21, in his house to sell it.
[00:27:07.156 --> 00:27:10.278]  And then he gets a SWAT team, Ray, they said he had a meth lab, there was nothing even in the house.
[00:27:10.298 --> 00:27:12.659]  I don't know, it's just a side issue, but go ahead.
[00:27:12.879 --> 00:27:27.208]  Yeah, this is actually the former mayor, Kay Waldo Barnes, and she's in a documentary, and one of my favorite moments in the whole documentary is I asked her at the end of the documentary about the businesses.
[00:27:28.286 --> 00:27:32.429]  of downtown that she's taking out with eminent domain and throwing on the side of the street.
[00:27:32.689 --> 00:27:36.992]  She looks at me and goes, I'm sorry, I don't answer non-media questions.
[00:27:37.233 --> 00:27:43.717]  Even I was invited in as a media person, she refused to answer my question and that's how we end the documentary.
[00:27:44.017 --> 00:27:46.019]  I do want to also mention the website.
[00:27:46.379 --> 00:27:46.679]  Yes.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:56.667]  Which is www.beggingforbillionaires.com and you will also see our trailer on there, a lot of information, articles,
[00:27:58.507 --> 00:28:01.489]  And G. Gordon Liddy, we did in the beginning of May.
[00:28:02.349 --> 00:28:06.470]  And I think you'll get a lot more information from the website.
[00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.351]  This is going on all over the country.
[00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:11.232]  And I was saying earlier... Are you kidding?
[00:28:11.492 --> 00:28:16.474]  They're using phony environmentalists where we've got property in East Texas to try to steal everybody's land.
[00:28:17.234 --> 00:28:17.915]  It's all phony.
[00:28:17.955 --> 00:28:18.675]  They're just thieves.
[00:28:19.255 --> 00:28:22.737]  But it's also racist.
[00:28:22.977 --> 00:28:28.481]  Richmond Heights, which is the original first black community in St.
[00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:28.861]  Louis.
[00:28:29.001 --> 00:28:32.824]  It was built for people who were working in the brick factory that was there.
[00:28:33.184 --> 00:28:40.508]  Richmond Heights has a lot of shopping centers, and Joanne Bailey basically says, we don't need any more shopping centers.
[00:28:40.548 --> 00:28:47.253]  They're taking out three blocks of this black community because, she says in her own words, they don't want us here.
[00:28:47.934 --> 00:28:51.174]  And they're going to build high-rise condos, expensive...
[00:28:54.156 --> 00:28:56.178]  Buildings and also a shopping center.
[00:28:56.258 --> 00:29:01.761]  And then all that does is actually drive up real estate prices, where the working folks and poor folks can't pay to live.
[00:29:02.362 --> 00:29:03.182]  It's unbelievable.
[00:29:03.423 --> 00:29:07.285]  Well, my favorite case, I think, in the whole documentary is Jim Roo.
[00:29:07.886 --> 00:29:10.588]  Jim Roo is a minister out of St.
[00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:10.968]  Louis.
[00:29:11.748 --> 00:29:14.030]  He lost quite a bit of property.
[00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:20.735]  What he basically does is he runs low-income housing for the poor.
[00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:26.099]  And they took out a bunch of his property, Bohemian Heights, to build a shopping center.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.202]  So he had one building that they were going to take, and they didn't take it.
[00:29:31.123 --> 00:29:43.171]  And what happened was, it looks over, coming east into the highway, into downtown Kansas City, he had this tall building, so he put a great big anti-imminent domain mural on his building.
[00:29:43.351 --> 00:29:46.853]  Well, the redevelopment agency told him to take it down, or they'll come and remove it.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:54.346]  He had a couple lawyers, and finally the Institute of Justice came in, and he won, saying it was the First Amendment.
[00:29:55.587 --> 00:30:03.455]  So now they're so mafia, they're going, hey, on your own property, you don't put up signs talking bad about us, so we'll send by some guys to take care of you.
[00:30:03.515 --> 00:30:10.682]  Yeah, and I told Jim, I said, if they come on your property and take the mural down, you have the Sheriff's Department arrest them for trespassing.
[00:30:12.584 --> 00:30:18.390]  Which is interesting, the court really ripped the redevelopment agency that had no authority.
[00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:19.191]  That's what I mean.
[00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:23.255]  Government and these quasi-government groups are getting crazier and crazier.
[00:30:23.715 --> 00:30:29.862]  Like, cops will see an ambulance drive by speeding and they'll say, he thinks he's above the law, I'm pulling the ambulance over.
[00:30:30.282 --> 00:30:32.364]  I mean, they're going crazy.
[00:30:33.485 --> 00:30:34.365]  It's scary out there.
[00:30:34.505 --> 00:30:41.447]  It really is because, Ann, you know, you look at your property, you know, go outside and look at your property and think... Is it really yours?
[00:30:41.467 --> 00:30:45.147]  You're already paying way too high of property tax on it.
[00:30:45.467 --> 00:30:46.968]  Most people can barely hold on to their property.
[00:30:46.988 --> 00:30:50.188]  Even if you can, it's really not yours because they can just come by and steal it.
[00:30:50.248 --> 00:31:00.030]  Yeah, but what's even funnier, we found out in the investigation, which is not in the documentary, there's developers driving around with maps looking at people's property in areas
[00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:01.551]  No, no, no, no.
[00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:02.491]  You know what we found?
[00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:12.815]  It was on West 36th Street, West 37th, because he had a house, he had two houses he built after World War II, Roland Ellingston, a retired arborist.
[00:31:13.155 --> 00:31:14.336]  I need to go see if Roland's alive.
[00:31:14.636 --> 00:31:18.497]  He was dying of cancer and I saw him years later at a rally, barely alive.
[00:31:18.517 --> 00:31:19.758]  He's just a really tough old guy.
[00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:21.739]  And this is how I found out about this, like in 1996.
[00:31:26.047 --> 00:31:27.688]  Go out there, and I noticed the same pattern.
[00:31:27.708 --> 00:31:40.211]  He had two houses he built, nice houses, but they were like Mercedes and Yuppies and, you know, three, four bedroom little houses, but nice, that were built in the 20s and 30s and stuff, 40s, that were going for $600,000, $700,000 back then.
[00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:41.111]  That was high for Austin.
[00:31:41.332 --> 00:31:42.212]  Must be millions now.
[00:31:43.212 --> 00:31:46.995]  And realtors would come and try to buy it, some of his neighbors, and he wouldn't sell.
[00:31:47.475 --> 00:31:51.277]  And so then it was the three-inch grass fines, and it was the cops coming and arresting him.
[00:31:51.298 --> 00:31:51.618]  Yeah.
[00:31:51.658 --> 00:31:55.180]  So I guess it's these parasitic realtors.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:55.780]  Yeah.
[00:31:56.361 --> 00:31:57.682]  And yeah, they're part of it.
[00:31:57.962 --> 00:32:01.064]  And what's interesting is getting back to H&R Block.
[00:32:01.144 --> 00:32:02.485]  It's not just H&R Block.
[00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:05.247]  It's a lot of Fortune 500 companies.
[00:32:05.587 --> 00:32:09.029]  Walmart is probably one of the worst abusers of eminent domain.
[00:32:09.349 --> 00:32:09.750]  Target.
[00:32:10.555 --> 00:32:13.576]  I mean, I could name... Well, Target's really a CIA, NSA front.
[00:32:13.596 --> 00:32:15.657]  Did you know their big business is security?
[00:32:15.857 --> 00:32:18.178]  Like the cameras and grids and biometrics you see?
[00:32:18.258 --> 00:32:18.618]  No.
[00:32:18.938 --> 00:32:20.139]  Target is the leader in that.
[00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:21.880]  Let's put that on screen.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.621]  Google targets security business.
[00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:26.662]  And then you'll see a bunch of headlines on that.
[00:32:26.682 --> 00:32:29.403]  Yeah, no, it's... Well, I mean, IBM's a government front.
[00:32:29.723 --> 00:32:30.803]  Microsoft's a government front.
[00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:32.444]  This is really on record as people don't know it.
[00:32:33.314 --> 00:32:33.694]  Wow.
[00:32:33.874 --> 00:32:35.174]  Yeah, Target's really wicked.
[00:32:35.214 --> 00:32:36.755]  Tell us about Target.
[00:32:37.135 --> 00:32:56.479]  Well, yeah, they've gone in and they've taken out homes and businesses and to build a Target or a shopping center, which Target will be in, and they've done Walmarts that way all over the country because I work with Internet domain groups all over the country from both coasts and I get emails of people telling me their stories.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.180]  Google Target's real business or Target stores real business.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.640]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:33:03.035 --> 00:33:12.439]  When you really find out that it's just kind of like a mafia type of deal, what happened is, big fortune 500's have become the new mafia.
[00:33:12.619 --> 00:33:13.680]  No, they're the global government.
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.881]  And they come into third world countries, the U.S.
[00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:22.504]  anywhere, and they buy off the local politicians, then they got the cops, and they say, look, we have weapons, stand down, it's ours!
[00:33:23.124 --> 00:33:29.247]  Actually, if you go to Google on YouTube, there's actually a
[00:33:31.852 --> 00:33:43.275]  A film on there of a woman being dragged at Connecticut, being dragged out of her home by police sheriff's office, actually pulling her out of the house.
[00:33:43.535 --> 00:33:46.816]  And some of these people in New London, Connecticut, these were three, four, five generations.
[00:33:47.136 --> 00:33:49.657]  These were doctors and lawyers.
[00:33:50.277 --> 00:33:57.639]  And the point is, if they'll go after middle class people and homes that have been in the family three generations, nobody's land is safe.
[00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:01.060]  Well, that's what happened in Sugar Creek.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:20.938]  Penelope Marsh talks about how her uncle lived down the street, her uncle lived in this house, her grandfather died in the house, she was born in the house, and her mother breaks down in tears and goes, I can't eat, I can't sleep, knowing that my house is going to be gone.
[00:34:21.178 --> 00:34:24.581]  But what we really show in this document is a psychological
[00:34:25.322 --> 00:34:26.943]  impact it has on people.
[00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:31.384]  We just don't have a bunch of talking politicians and a bunch of experts.
[00:34:31.604 --> 00:34:34.645]  We have actually the people telling their story.
[00:34:34.665 --> 00:34:36.425]  I think that was... Yeah, that's what's important.
[00:34:36.505 --> 00:34:39.546]  I mean, look, a lot of people don't care about money and power.
[00:34:39.566 --> 00:34:40.427]  We're the normal people.
[00:34:40.727 --> 00:34:42.327]  We care about ancestral homes.
[00:34:42.367 --> 00:34:43.788]  We care about family.
[00:34:43.808 --> 00:34:44.688]  We care about comfort.
[00:34:44.708 --> 00:34:46.008]  We care about roots.
[00:34:46.528 --> 00:34:51.430]  And these dirty robber barons just run around all over the world kicking... Look, I remember
[00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:57.759]  Twenty years ago, being in southern Mexico and Yucatan, and there were brochures in all the nice hotels.
[00:34:58.672 --> 00:35:01.713]  Get UN biosphere land for super cheap.
[00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:03.273]  And now they've built it all up.
[00:35:03.293 --> 00:35:10.136]  And then later I learned they would kick the indigenous peoples all over Mexico off their cornfield lands they've been on for a thousand years.
[00:35:10.376 --> 00:35:11.376]  They'd say, where's your deed?
[00:35:11.436 --> 00:35:13.057]  Well, we've always lived here in this village.
[00:35:13.377 --> 00:35:14.137]  This is our land.
[00:35:14.837 --> 00:35:16.718]  And that's why they're all in Mexico City.
[00:35:16.738 --> 00:35:24.660]  That's why Mexico City went from 12 million to 33 million in just 15 years, is they force them all up there off their land and then to the US to have jobs.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.901]  You can't blame them wanting to come here.
[00:35:27.541 --> 00:35:29.542]  It's the same thing there, but it was U.N.
[00:35:29.642 --> 00:35:31.263]  sanctioned, where the U.N.
[00:35:31.303 --> 00:35:35.905]  and big corporations just paid the Mexican government, and they said, okay, come on in and just take whatever they got.
[00:35:36.365 --> 00:35:36.705]  Wow.
[00:35:37.226 --> 00:35:45.910]  You know, yeah, and Richmond Hyde, and well, I'll tell you, Arnold, we were really shocked what happened at Arnold.
[00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.272]  We went to, I don't know if you know about Dr. Dukakis, he was a dentist that's
[00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.670]  There was a lot of publicity about it.
[00:35:53.211 --> 00:36:01.538]  They were building the development around him, and they put dirt mounds and tore up the roads so his patients couldn't come, and they were harassing him.
[00:36:01.998 --> 00:36:09.124]  Well, we went down to do the interview for the documentary, and we met this guy named Steve, who had a trailer park.
[00:36:09.164 --> 00:36:15.349]  Originally, Arnold was all trailer parks, and now it's, I couldn't believe it, it's like one shopping center across from another.
[00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:17.851]  They have like 20 shopping centers for this little town.
[00:36:19.253 --> 00:36:21.855]  And he invited us to the city council meeting.
[00:36:21.875 --> 00:36:24.937]  He goes, you're not going to believe this since you're doing this documentary.
[00:36:25.337 --> 00:36:36.384]  Well, if you show up at the city council meeting and talk about eminent domain or redevelopment, the mayor at that time, the Mayor Pro Temp, when we were there, said, this is your warning.
[00:36:37.447 --> 00:36:38.187]  You're out of order.
[00:36:38.267 --> 00:36:40.628]  Oh, that's all over the country that you're arrested.
[00:36:41.088 --> 00:36:42.369]  They say there's no free speech.
[00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:45.429]  No, I've seen it a million times, but no, I didn't know about this case.
[00:36:45.609 --> 00:36:48.570]  Yeah, and they basically dragged him out of the meeting.
[00:36:49.191 --> 00:36:50.811]  Escorting three cops.
[00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:52.452]  Arnold is one of the worst.
[00:36:52.832 --> 00:36:55.192]  He's been trying to get documents for a year and a half.
[00:36:55.412 --> 00:36:56.613]  They won't give a document.
[00:36:56.713 --> 00:37:00.254]  Listen, under zoning in Illinois, did you see this in the Illinois papers?
[00:37:00.854 --> 00:37:03.777]  About five, six years ago, people wake up at 6 a.m.
[00:37:03.797 --> 00:37:04.858]  and the cops are in front of them.
[00:37:04.898 --> 00:37:11.425]  They come in your house without a warrant for a home inspection of zoning to make sure more people aren't living there that are supposed to.
[00:37:11.766 --> 00:37:20.795]  And even if there's two people zoned for the house, they will go look and see if there's more than two toothbrushes and then give you a fine if there's more than two toothbrushes for two people.
[00:37:20.835 --> 00:37:22.076]  Now I've got like three in my drawer.
[00:37:22.677 --> 00:37:27.039]  What happens if you're using a toothbrush to clean your dog or your cat?
[00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:28.100]  You can't make this up.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:33.142]  This was in the newspapers and they were saying it was good and the people were bad because they didn't like it.
[00:37:33.423 --> 00:37:34.703]  What's the name of the YouTube video?
[00:37:34.723 --> 00:37:37.044]  We're going to play your trailer first with them dragging the lady out.
[00:37:37.064 --> 00:37:38.485]  Do you remember the name?
[00:37:38.645 --> 00:37:40.066]  It's New London.
[00:37:40.386 --> 00:37:43.508]  It's one of the New London... New London Woman Taken From Home Woman?
[00:37:43.528 --> 00:37:43.728]  Yeah.
[00:37:44.388 --> 00:37:46.009]  Costello, it's Costello.
[00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:47.489]  Oh, I interviewed them many times.
[00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.810]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:51.971]  New London, Connecticut, Costello family.
[00:37:52.011 --> 00:37:58.172]  Yeah, and they show her dragging her out of the house, and it's probably one of the most shocking YouTubes I've ever seen.
[00:37:58.192 --> 00:38:03.174]  We're going to find that before you go, but right now, let's play the trailer to Begging for Billionaires.
[00:38:03.574 --> 00:38:08.636]  Not enough for these pigs to, and they are pigs, to run our lives.
[00:38:08.916 --> 00:38:12.277]  They've got to have it all, they've got to have it now, and here it is.
[00:38:24.921 --> 00:38:29.082]  Some of our elected officials are undermining our constitutional rights in the name of big business.
[00:38:30.242 --> 00:38:32.943]  It's understood that they don't have the assets to fight it.
[00:38:33.183 --> 00:38:36.343]  You know, once they put the burden on me... Well, let's hit pause.
[00:38:36.383 --> 00:38:37.603]  You're as bad as I am.
[00:38:37.643 --> 00:38:38.023]  Back it up.
[00:38:38.043 --> 00:38:43.444]  Let's start it over when I'm not reading the text for people on the radio and when you're not... You know what?
[00:38:43.664 --> 00:38:43.965]  I'm sorry.
[00:38:43.985 --> 00:38:44.705]  You thought we were off air.
[00:38:45.405 --> 00:38:47.085]  I was reading the subtitles here.
[00:38:47.105 --> 00:38:48.045]  Let's start it over.
[00:38:48.065 --> 00:38:51.366]  I want folks to see this watching on Prison Planet on TV and listening on the radio.
[00:38:51.386 --> 00:38:51.626]  Here it is.
[00:39:08.409 --> 00:39:13.535]  When people hear the word eminent domain, it's understood that they don't have the assets to fight it.
[00:39:13.775 --> 00:39:16.759]  You know, once they put the gun on me, we didn't have a choice.
[00:39:17.867 --> 00:39:21.688]  Because you know the law is on their side, not our side.
[00:39:22.108 --> 00:39:32.750]  So just imagine if every tree, every view, every familiar touch that your family had ever known for 80 years was going to be destroyed by a developer for a plan, for a planned project.
[00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:41.512]  It's been nothing but a nightmare where you can't sleep, you can't eat, you can't even begin to function right.
[00:39:42.332 --> 00:39:45.953]  Because of all the harassment, the threats,
[00:39:47.489 --> 00:39:51.018]  To our knowledge, there were never any problems with our property.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.269]  They just coveted it and they were going to take it.
[00:39:57.051 --> 00:40:04.353]  We've always had eminent domain for public works, for roads, for bridges, for schools, for streets.
[00:40:05.134 --> 00:40:14.517]  But the idea that we would take private property away from one person and give it to another private interest, that's a new idea.
[00:40:15.197 --> 00:40:23.720]  Those that have power, those that have the ability to influence what happens in City Hall are the ones that are going to profit from it.
[00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:31.282]  That is exactly what our founding fathers were trying to prevent when the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution was added to the Bill of Rights.
[00:40:32.082 --> 00:40:33.143]  You simply couldn't stop it.
[00:40:33.583 --> 00:40:34.343]  We couldn't stop it.
[00:40:34.363 --> 00:40:40.986]  And it didn't matter how beneficial and substantial
[00:40:41.864 --> 00:40:53.207]  There's the mural that the city was trying to tell them they didn't have a First Amendment right to.
[00:40:59.289 --> 00:41:00.569]  And it just gets worse and worse.
[00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.210]  For those watching and listening to that, tell us a little bit about the people in the trailer.
[00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.431]  You were telling me particularly about the black fellow, something that happened to him.
[00:41:07.451 --> 00:41:10.932]  Yeah, well, he's the spokesperson.
[00:41:11.832 --> 00:41:14.593]  He basically explains different things through the whole documentary.
[00:41:15.333 --> 00:41:19.254]  And he had a bunch of homes that he bought.
[00:41:19.932 --> 00:41:20.573]  I don't know.
[00:41:36.482 --> 00:41:41.707]  They actually, the demolition guy, called him and let him come in to take out his property.
[00:41:42.007 --> 00:41:45.410]  And he talks about his property and everything.
[00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:51.575]  But the best story he tells, and I think it's the best piece in the documentary, is the Reverend Ike story.
[00:41:51.595 --> 00:41:53.077]  I don't know if you know about Reverend Ike.
[00:41:53.177 --> 00:42:00.863]  Reverend Ike was a black preacher in the 30s who would tell people that you're too poor to have money.
[00:42:01.364 --> 00:42:03.646]  Send me your money and watch me enjoy it.
[00:42:04.406 --> 00:42:06.490]  And I will sell you a prayer cloth.
[00:42:06.871 --> 00:42:14.884]  And what he's saying, Richard, is you're too poor to pay for an entertainment district or an arena.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.701]  Which was part of the redevelopment section.
[00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:22.262]  Both of them were where Darrell Penner was.
[00:42:22.282 --> 00:42:25.483]  And they always use taxpayer money to build those as well.
[00:42:25.504 --> 00:42:26.464]  Yeah, well it's interesting.
[00:42:26.524 --> 00:42:28.085]  That is total bond fraud.
[00:42:28.385 --> 00:42:31.086]  Which we didn't cover in the documentary because it was too complex.
[00:42:31.586 --> 00:42:36.028]  But basically it's a Ponzi scheme with the city because those bonds never get paid off.
[00:42:36.048 --> 00:42:36.728]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:42:36.748 --> 00:42:38.289]  Final segment, we gotta have you back.
[00:42:38.809 --> 00:42:44.232]  When we come back, let's tell folks about some of the bond fraud and more about the film Begging for Billionaires.
[00:42:44.952 --> 00:42:47.373]  The attack on private property rights in America.
[00:42:47.653 --> 00:42:50.374]  You see, folks, they're attacking the 2nd Amendment, 5th, 10th.
[00:42:50.854 --> 00:42:52.035]  Everything's being attacked.
[00:42:52.395 --> 00:42:52.935]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:53.695 --> 00:43:03.779]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:43:04.259 --> 00:43:05.320]  Garden in a can.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.261]  Garden in a can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:11.582]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[00:43:11.842 --> 00:43:14.123]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[00:43:14.604 --> 00:43:23.606]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[00:43:24.272 --> 00:43:25.272]  Garden in a Can.
[00:43:25.693 --> 00:43:26.553]  It's that simple.
[00:43:26.893 --> 00:43:28.774]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[00:43:29.294 --> 00:43:33.256]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[00:43:33.636 --> 00:43:34.556]  Ready when you are.
[00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:38.838]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.

[00:43:53.251 --> 00:43:58.557]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:43:59.057 --> 00:44:06.045]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:06.633 --> 00:44:12.817]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:13.218 --> 00:44:15.059]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:17.621]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:17.701 --> 00:44:28.648]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:29.269 --> 00:44:30.570]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.311]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:39.118]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:39.699 --> 00:44:47.488]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:47.968 --> 00:44:49.130]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.752]  The people strike back.
[00:44:52.876 --> 00:44:54.737]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:44:54.857 --> 00:45:00.038]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:01.559]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:10.002]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:45:10.222 --> 00:45:15.944]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:45:16.124 --> 00:45:17.926]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:45:17.966 --> 00:45:20.128]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:45:20.148 --> 00:45:24.512]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:45:24.692 --> 00:45:26.814]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:45:26.914 --> 00:45:34.741]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:35.262]  We're good.
[00:46:02.245 --> 00:46:05.087]  Okay, folks, the website is BeggingForBillionaires.com.
[00:46:05.107 --> 00:46:06.448]  My website is InfoWars.com.
[00:46:06.488 --> 00:46:15.373]  Don't forget our films, Endgame, Terror Storm, Road to Tyranny, Truth Rising, the new one, The Obama Deception, showing what a fraud this guy is.
[00:46:15.734 --> 00:46:22.338]  Richard Gage is coming up for 30 minutes with all big developments there on the fact that all these physicists and engineers are coming out.
[00:46:23.138 --> 00:46:26.281]  Peer-reviewed journals saying 9-11 was clearly an inside job of the Towers.
[00:46:26.681 --> 00:46:28.863]  Blown the kingdom come by whoever did it.
[00:46:29.664 --> 00:46:31.786]  I guess cave dwellers did it.
[00:46:32.226 --> 00:46:33.047]  So that is coming up.
[00:46:33.067 --> 00:46:42.195]  And I'll get into Glenn Beck coming out with the MIAC report, the DHS report saying yes, militias, gun owners, they do work with Al-Qaeda, they need to all basically be arrested.
[00:46:42.676 --> 00:46:46.940]  That's your patriot, that's your... I mean this guy is such a snake.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.801]  But listen, I want to have you back.
[00:46:49.722 --> 00:46:54.885]  How do folks go to the New Braunfels Texa Dance Film Festival?
[00:46:55.065 --> 00:46:56.745]  It's right up there on our website.
[00:46:56.985 --> 00:47:00.747]  They can click on and get the information right on our website there on the bottom.
[00:47:01.608 --> 00:47:05.790]  They can click on and buy tickets and it gives the address and everything of where the theater is.
[00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:06.070]  Good.
[00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:07.730]  When can we get this on DVD?
[00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:09.811]  How long until there's a DVD release?
[00:47:09.831 --> 00:47:10.852]  Because I'd like to carry the film.
[00:47:11.152 --> 00:47:12.293]  A year and a half, probably?
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:35.660]  Fascism.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:36.241]  What was it?
[00:47:36.441 --> 00:47:37.501]  America, freedom of fascism.
[00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:38.282]  Yeah, we carry that.
[00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:41.863]  It went into the theaters for a little bit and then it just kind of disappeared.
[00:47:42.364 --> 00:47:46.365]  Yeah, my experience is, I mean, look at Terminator Salvation.
[00:47:46.686 --> 00:47:48.927]  Big company, $200 million budget, it's a flop.
[00:47:49.427 --> 00:47:53.069]  I mean, even big, huge companies, most of their stuff's a failure.
[00:47:53.929 --> 00:47:55.590]  Uh, I mean, take Scanner Darkly.
[00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:59.651]  Now, it made its $9 million budget back and then some, but still wasn't a big success.
[00:47:59.951 --> 00:48:02.212]  I think total it's made like $30 million or something.
[00:48:02.772 --> 00:48:04.433]  And the stars basically work for free.
[00:48:04.513 --> 00:48:10.034]  Keanu Reeves and all that, they'd usually get $20 million more than the budget to be in something like Scanner Darkly.
[00:48:10.215 --> 00:48:11.915]  But that was a love affair film they made.
[00:48:12.415 --> 00:48:14.536]  So, uh, you know, but side issue.
[00:48:15.336 --> 00:48:17.117]  I think I was paid $600 to be in that film.
[00:48:17.777 --> 00:48:18.258]  Oh, you were?
[00:48:18.358 --> 00:48:19.599]  And I offered to do it for free.
[00:48:19.639 --> 00:48:20.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:25.005]  And Rick Linklater said, no, you got to... But I just want to let... You're taffed Hartley into this film.
[00:48:25.025 --> 00:48:25.566]  You have to be in it.
[00:48:26.127 --> 00:48:34.075]  Just to let audiences know that the reason why I made this film, and I think it's important, is after Kelo, the media is...
[00:48:34.776 --> 00:48:37.618]  Basically, part of the problem with corruption.
[00:48:38.758 --> 00:48:43.221]  I just had a thing with Clay Chastain where I went after a media guy for the Kansas City Star.
[00:48:43.361 --> 00:49:01.150]  Kansas City Star is probably one of the biggest forms of corruption in Kansas City, because they basically are in the pockets of developers, and the downtown council, the Chamber of Commerce, and any activists who... We've had security guards on the side of the sidewalk in Kansas City tell my cameramen they're not allowed to be on the sidewalk.
[00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:03.031]  I mean, it's like they're God.
[00:49:03.391 --> 00:49:06.793]  Yeah, well actually that happened in downtown when we're making this film.
[00:49:07.234 --> 00:49:17.641]  I went into the Power Light District, which is downtown where they took out Penner's building, right actually across from Penner's building, and security guards told me that I could not film
[00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:19.451]  on this property.
[00:49:19.531 --> 00:49:23.633]  Not only that, but the buildings, you're going to love this, were copyrighted.
[00:49:23.713 --> 00:49:24.933]  I could not film the buildings.
[00:49:24.993 --> 00:49:25.574]  Oh, I know.
[00:49:26.574 --> 00:49:30.756]  In New York City, the cops walk out and say, you've got to have permission to film this building.
[00:49:31.037 --> 00:49:31.877]  I go, First Amendment.
[00:49:32.337 --> 00:49:34.238]  All right, take him to the department.
[00:49:34.919 --> 00:49:36.539]  What do you think, this is a free country, punk?
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:37.820]  We run things now!
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.882]  I mean, literally.
[00:49:42.443 --> 00:49:45.884]  And I've had Austin cops come up and tell me that we can't protest or can't have video cameras.
[00:49:45.904 --> 00:49:46.425]  And I go, look,
[00:49:47.145 --> 00:49:49.407]  I'm going to have to sue you personally if you take me to jail.
[00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:51.448]  And I go, you'll beat the rap, but you won't beat the ride.
[00:49:51.969 --> 00:49:52.789]  And they back off.
[00:49:52.809 --> 00:49:56.132]  But the fact is, how do they get cops to think we are slaves?
[00:49:57.292 --> 00:50:00.795]  I think it's a mentality of their training.
[00:50:01.696 --> 00:50:06.059]  And I think one of the things I've always said when I see cop beatings and
[00:50:06.679 --> 00:50:13.284]  And all this stuff that the cops need to go back to school and be taught a whole course on First Amendment rights.
[00:50:13.884 --> 00:50:17.146]  They should actually have a First Amendment... But the system doesn't want them to know!
[00:50:17.286 --> 00:50:17.526]  No!
[00:50:17.727 --> 00:50:18.787]  You're absolutely right!
[00:50:19.348 --> 00:50:19.748]  You know what?
[00:50:19.768 --> 00:50:20.088]  You know what?
[00:50:20.128 --> 00:50:22.530]  Let's do a few more minutes, then Richard Gage is going to come up at the gate after.
[00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:32.977]  Because I want to talk about a few of the other stories, a jam-packed film, and we are talking to the director and executive producer, Philip Klein, begging for billionaires to attack on property rights and get the Obama Deception, too.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.241]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:49.167 --> 00:50:50.327]  Inner Health Botanicals.

[00:51:48.632 --> 00:51:51.414]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:01.802]  If you don't have a First Amendment, you have nothing.
[00:52:01.882 --> 00:52:04.922]  If you don't have property rights, you have nothing.
[00:52:04.942 --> 00:52:08.223]  If you don't have a Second Amendment, you have nothing.
[00:52:08.283 --> 00:52:13.504]  The entire ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, the core, are under attack.
[00:52:28.695 --> 00:52:33.497]  Philip Klein, award-winning filmmaker of the new film, Begging for Billionaires, The Attack on Private Property Rights.
[00:52:33.998 --> 00:52:38.079]  You told me about something I'd actually read about, but you were just confirming with more details.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:45.263]  All over the country, they've built FEMA and FBI and NORTHCOM command bunkers, and they don't tell the public.
[00:52:45.683 --> 00:52:45.923]  I don't know.
[00:53:08.016 --> 00:53:11.177]  Bergstrom Airport used to be a SAC base.
[00:53:11.238 --> 00:53:13.158]  It has underground railways as well.
[00:53:13.258 --> 00:53:14.279]  But anyway, side issue.
[00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:15.739]  This is the shadow government.
[00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:17.500]  Tell folks about what you know about that.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.921]  Let me go back to my first experience with the FBI.
[00:53:21.421 --> 00:53:23.662]  I tell people to not go to the FBI.
[00:53:24.742 --> 00:53:31.905]  When I was fighting this redevelopment project the first time around, I understand Derwin called the Power and Life District, which
[00:53:32.452 --> 00:53:47.116]  Originally it was the Silo Project, but then after it was put in, Mayor Kay Wolder-Barnes decided in memory of Stan Derwood, who ran AFC Theatres, going to call it the Power and Light District.
[00:53:47.176 --> 00:53:50.437]  Well, I went to them, met with this woman FBI agent.
[00:53:51.343 --> 00:53:56.106]  And the first thing she says to me, you have to promise me that you don't videotape me.
[00:53:56.126 --> 00:53:59.167]  I mean, you don't auto-tape me and I won't auto-tape you.
[00:53:59.187 --> 00:54:05.071]  Well, the next meeting she brought a SAC in, which I knew was a recorder.
[00:54:05.911 --> 00:54:12.635]  The next thing I knew was they had FBI agents interviewing me and then she brought in a profiler.
[00:54:14.561 --> 00:54:16.382]  Gotta tell you you're bad and you're dangerous.
[00:54:16.402 --> 00:54:17.443]  No, no, I was just sitting there.
[00:54:17.783 --> 00:54:20.244]  It was just sitting there listening to me, this profiler.
[00:54:20.364 --> 00:54:22.585]  Like something's wrong with you for a number one.
[00:54:22.765 --> 00:54:25.986]  For squealing and I kept calling the profiler her partner.
[00:54:26.227 --> 00:54:31.389]  And she was getting very, very angry because I was calling her her partner for some strange reason.
[00:54:31.409 --> 00:54:33.610]  Because, you know, she worked with her as a partner.
[00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:34.710]  You're supposed to call it your partner.
[00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:35.170]  Yeah.
[00:54:35.531 --> 00:54:37.371]  You know, that's what they do in law enforcement.
[00:54:39.366 --> 00:54:41.586]  Well, the FBI... Well, they decided to take offense at everything.
[00:54:41.606 --> 00:54:55.949]  That's part of the... Well, the funny thing... Part of them psychologically and the psychopathic mindset to, you know... But the funny story is what I did to her was, it was right after Clinton had, was involved with, remember the gun running that they found all those Chinese weapons?
[00:54:55.969 --> 00:54:57.070]  Yeah.
[00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.090]  At the docks in California.
[00:54:59.110 --> 00:54:59.750]  7,000 AK-47s and heroin.
[00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:00.510]  And just a month before...
[00:55:03.411 --> 00:55:10.139]  After that, the INS started raiding Chinese restaurants and they found a huge amount of illegal aliens.
[00:55:10.159 --> 00:55:10.940]  We're almost out of time.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:11.861]  Tell us about the FBI building.
[00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:14.164]  Okay, let me tell you about the FBI building real quick.
[00:55:14.805 --> 00:55:19.931]  It's not only seven stories down to the west bottom where the railroad tracks is.
[00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:22.314]  I think there's a hidden entrance down underneath.
[00:55:22.935 --> 00:55:27.883]  But it goes to mark Mid-America Regional Council and a couple other buildings.
[00:55:28.103 --> 00:55:33.733]  It's all a big rock cliff, so they dug all this out of pure rock, granite.
[00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:35.871]  We're good to go.
[00:55:58.058 --> 00:56:14.189]  It was confirmed by two people, one of them who was one of the guys who actually dug out the rock, who was involved in digging out the rock with machines, confirmed that there is, goes down 20 stories down.
[00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:18.632]  And I'm going, why would the FBI need a 20 story operation?
[00:56:18.652 --> 00:56:22.115]  Because they're about to take everything we got and they know we're gonna resist.
[00:56:23.038 --> 00:56:25.019]  And that's Union Station.
[00:56:25.059 --> 00:56:26.379]  That's not the FBI building.
[00:56:26.699 --> 00:56:27.000]  Yeah, I know.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:28.320]  I was telling the guys, look for it.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.901]  They're just clicking around trying to find it.
[00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:41.665]  But, Edge, I don't think you're going to find it on the web because I don't think the FBI want their building to be... It's up in a corner where you can't get to it.
[00:56:41.685 --> 00:56:43.246]  You've got to Google new FBI.
[00:56:44.326 --> 00:56:47.228]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:56:47.268 --> 00:56:51.912]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:56:51.932 --> 00:56:54.914]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:18.969]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:57:19.209 --> 00:57:24.771]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[00:57:24.952 --> 00:57:26.032]  Hospitals, restaurants,
[00:57:26.212 --> 00:57:26.752]  It is a big idea!
[00:57:56.562 --> 00:57:57.622]  A New World Order!
[00:57:58.343 --> 00:58:02.725]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:03.225 --> 00:58:06.026]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:08.307]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:08.847 --> 00:58:11.308]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:58:12.028 --> 00:58:19.371]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:58:22.377 --> 00:58:27.361]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:58:27.821 --> 00:58:31.283]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:58:31.704 --> 00:58:34.165]  Bill of Regents is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:58:34.265 --> 00:58:35.226]  Most people have no idea.
[00:58:35.246 --> 00:58:36.187]  They're not after money.
[00:58:36.207 --> 00:58:37.287]  They have all the money they need.
[00:58:37.507 --> 00:58:38.208]  They're after power.
[00:58:38.468 --> 00:58:39.309]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:58:52.317 --> 00:58:54.459]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:54.499 --> 00:58:59.864]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:59:00.105 --> 00:59:04.729]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:05.129 --> 00:59:10.194]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:59:10.694 --> 00:59:15.399]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:17.781]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:59:18.228 --> 00:59:22.832]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:23.032 --> 00:59:23.913]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:24.133 --> 00:59:26.915]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:27.215 --> 00:59:30.518]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:30.838 --> 00:59:33.680]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:34.021 --> 00:59:35.902]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:36.242 --> 00:59:37.163]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:37.183 --> 00:59:37.363]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:37.383 --> 00:59:38.504]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:59:47.321 --> 00:59:49.542]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:49.862 --> 00:59:52.304]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:58.387 --> 00:59:59.047]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.708 --> 01:00:00.808]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.469 --> 01:00:02.609]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:04.070]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:05.691]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.371 --> 01:00:09.993]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.554 --> 01:00:14.616]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.189 --> 01:00:16.349]  Yeah.
[01:00:31.946 --> 01:00:35.829]  Man, two hours and eight minutes went by like it was five minutes.
[01:00:35.929 --> 01:00:42.854]  I mean, these four-hour shows, I went from three hours to four hours about a year ago because I felt like I needed more time.
[01:00:42.954 --> 01:00:45.616]  And now, four hours doesn't seem like enough time.
[01:00:45.636 --> 01:00:53.281]  And then, four hours locked down every day burns a lot of the time I've got to film-make and do research and set up guests and everything else we do.
[01:00:53.922 --> 01:00:58.705]  There's just not enough hours in the day, as they say, for people that are busy fighting the new world order.
[01:00:58.745 --> 01:01:00.246]  Gerald Solente coming up next hour.
[01:01:01.445 --> 01:01:10.375]  Coming up in about 40 minutes, a huge news blitz, and the government and the media are saying, gun owners, conservatives, veterans, basically all work for Al Qaeda.
[01:01:10.856 --> 01:01:12.378]  We broke the DHS documents.
[01:01:12.398 --> 01:01:17.704]  People said they were fake, of course, and the MIAC documents said they were fake, until the news had to admit they were real.
[01:01:18.385 --> 01:01:19.646]  That went on for several weeks.
[01:01:21.168 --> 01:01:26.312]  And we're telling you that Glenn Beck is involved in this operation, and I'll be exposing him.
[01:01:26.352 --> 01:01:28.033]  And again, I don't get into these ego wars.
[01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:30.295]  I'm not going after Beck because he's a big TV host.
[01:01:30.315 --> 01:01:31.896]  People send me emails saying that.
[01:01:32.557 --> 01:01:37.321]  I'm going after him because he's saying 9-11 truthers need to be arrested.
[01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:42.105]  Because he's saying Ron Paul supporters are, quote, McVeigh terrorists, need to have the army used on them.
[01:01:43.217 --> 01:01:51.347]  I'm saying that because he came out and said he thought FEMA camps were real, but that he was going to expose them, and then I predicted exactly how he strawman debunked them.
[01:01:54.352 --> 01:02:00.075]  And now he comes out and says, oh yes, American militias are going to release anthrax on the American people.
[01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:04.037]  Hey, Beck, the White House launched the anthrax attacks of 2001.
[01:02:04.577 --> 01:02:06.178]  I'm going to recap that coming up.
[01:02:06.999 --> 01:02:08.900]  You know what you're doing, and it's not funny.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:11.361]  And you say you're this patriot fighting the New World Order.
[01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.302]  You are a Judas goat.
[01:02:13.762 --> 01:02:15.223]  You are a camouflaged enemy.
[01:02:15.423 --> 01:02:17.364]  And your camouflage isn't very good.
[01:02:17.384 --> 01:02:18.525]  I see right through you, pal.
[01:02:19.105 --> 01:02:24.511]  And so, uh, more than ever, he's making himself obvious to everybody, and people are really waking up to you now.
[01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:25.693]  And see, that's okay.
[01:02:25.713 --> 01:02:26.414]  That's what I'm here for.
[01:02:26.714 --> 01:02:32.861]  I'm here to come on air before 9-11, and two months before, really six months before, I started talking about it, but two months before, I said, call the White House.
[01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:35.604]  They're going to blow the towers up, blame it on their CIS at Bin Laden.
[01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:39.589]  And I lost two-thirds of my stations and got attacked, and had people cuss at me on the street.
[01:02:40.762 --> 01:02:45.325]  And then on the day it happened, my TV show from months before happened to re-air.
[01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:49.747]  We got hundreds of phone calls thinking that I was talking about it being an inside job that day.
[01:02:49.787 --> 01:02:50.888]  No, that was two months before.
[01:02:51.548 --> 01:02:52.368]  That's what I'm here for.
[01:02:52.408 --> 01:02:55.110]  I'm here to come out and tell you Beck's a traitor and then have it be proven right later.
[01:02:55.510 --> 01:03:00.333]  See, because I only care about being right and honorable and telling the truth and studying the enemy.
[01:03:00.533 --> 01:03:01.974]  And my hard research has paid off.
[01:03:03.342 --> 01:03:04.743]  Richard Gage for the next 30 minutes or so.
[01:03:04.763 --> 01:03:06.185]  We really appreciate him coming on.
[01:03:06.245 --> 01:03:09.748]  He's the founder of Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truths.
[01:03:09.768 --> 01:03:11.389]  He's been out, what, a year and a half, two years?
[01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:13.371]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[01:03:13.391 --> 01:03:18.616]  Look at the exact numbers of engineers, architects, physicists, peer-reviewed papers, top.
[01:03:19.116 --> 01:03:19.596]  Thank you.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:44.102]  Just all over the place, who are scientists, waking up, looking at the samples, looking at the evidence of explosives, and getting more and more media attention.
[01:03:44.543 --> 01:03:55.666]  And now we've had a senator questioned by We Are Change, it made Fox News, by Luke Rudowsky and others, Luke's on tomorrow, saying to them, hey, should there be a new 9-11 investigation?
[01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:57.747]  He says yes, it becomes a national news story.
[01:03:58.784 --> 01:04:02.689]  The fact that Obama's covering up for all this becomes a national news story.
[01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:06.694]  We've had government-sponsored terror before that's declassified, admit it.
[01:04:07.725 --> 01:04:11.207]  The government admits they've staged terror attacks before in other countries and domestically.
[01:04:11.567 --> 01:04:13.349]  So why don't we look at them in this case?
[01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:15.490]  Then when you do look, it's unbelievable.
[01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:20.413]  But Richard Gage is going at this from a scientific perspective, and it's been getting a lot of news attention.
[01:04:20.453 --> 01:04:33.562]  I'm going to play a clip of that coming up, but I wanted to get Richard on to give us a progress report on architects and engineers, 9-11 Truth, and where it's going, and all these peer-reviewed journals and things that are coming out, and all these scientists.
[01:04:34.677 --> 01:04:37.859]  Thanks Alex, it's just incredible to be here with you again.
[01:04:37.879 --> 01:04:43.523]  Well, we have almost 700 architects and engineers now demanding a new investigation of the three World Trade Center high-rise buildings.
[01:05:05.474 --> 01:05:07.835]  On 9-11, the destruction of those buildings.
[01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:11.257]  We are marching forward.
[01:05:11.277 --> 01:05:13.758]  There's been a lot of activity as you've suggested.
[01:05:15.598 --> 01:05:23.742]  Most recently we were at the National Convention of Architects, the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco.
[01:05:24.665 --> 01:05:35.027]  And we had a booth there, and we handed out a thousand DVDs of our latest DVD, the companion DVD to 9-11 Blueprint for Truth.
[01:05:35.648 --> 01:05:46.350]  It has the 10-minute, 30-minute, and 60-minute abridged versions of our two-hour presentation where we outlay all of this evidence that we're going to be talking about.
[01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:47.850]  We're good to go.
[01:06:04.988 --> 01:06:14.110]  Well, building 7 going down symmetrically at freefall speed, acceleration, straight down into its own footprint, same with the Twin Towers.
[01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:17.031]  They're saying, well, wait a minute, that happened on 9-11?
[01:06:17.171 --> 01:06:23.272]  We're going, yep, it's the third worst structural failure in modern history and you didn't know about it?
[01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:24.072]  No!
[01:06:24.292 --> 01:06:27.033]  Well, neither did I three years ago before I started.
[01:06:27.762 --> 01:06:29.242]  And so they're just in shock.
[01:06:29.282 --> 01:06:35.703]  We got 60 of these architects to sign our petition, which was extraordinary.
[01:06:35.824 --> 01:06:43.985]  So we kind of see it as a new mission to go to these conventions throughout the United States.
[01:06:44.045 --> 01:06:48.566]  There was over 15,000 architects at this convention.
[01:06:48.606 --> 01:06:49.646]  We couldn't reach all of them.
[01:06:49.666 --> 01:06:51.926]  There just simply wasn't enough time.
[01:06:51.946 --> 01:06:54.067]  And there was a huge number of booths.
[01:06:54.907 --> 01:07:01.894]  There's regional conventions all through the United States, and so we're now raising funds to go to all of them.
[01:07:01.974 --> 01:07:09.101]  We have a hundred sustaining members now, and we need that number to grow to 200.
[01:07:10.102 --> 01:07:17.810]  Very dedicated people providing us as little as $10 a month, they can become sustaining members of AE911 Truth.
[01:07:19.361 --> 01:07:29.223]  And so, with that and our fundraising effort to obtain the booth fees for these conventions, Washington, D.C., for instance, is happening mid-July.
[01:07:29.583 --> 01:07:47.906]  That's the one that we're very excited about, because once we go to Washington, D.C., we're right in, of course, contact with government officials we hope to visit there, as well as the national AIA, where we hope to finally meet with the board of the American Institute of Architects and its president.
[01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:55.907]  Who did allow us, after a lot of controversy, to have the booth in San Francisco at the National Convention.
[01:07:56.721 --> 01:08:06.703]  And while we were there, we actually met the CEO of the Virginia chapter, in Richmond, Virginia, of the American Institute of Architects, and he says, where have you guys been?
[01:08:07.003 --> 01:08:08.223]  We've been waiting for you!
[01:08:08.243 --> 01:08:12.284]  This is fantastic, I knew all about this, but I didn't know about you!
[01:08:12.764 --> 01:08:19.045]  So he wants us to come to his regional convention in mid-November and early November.
[01:08:19.065 --> 01:08:22.406]  Let me stop you there, Richard Gage, because this is what's key, what you're explaining.
[01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:28.770]  We don't realize we're really the majority and I keep trying to explain this to everybody that four years ago we had polls.
[01:08:29.907 --> 01:08:33.790]  For over 60% of Americans, scientific polls believe we're being lied to about 9-11.
[01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:35.031]  Now we have polls of over 80%.
[01:08:36.352 --> 01:08:47.901]  I went to the beach, because my daughter wanted to go there for her birthday, a little Texas beach this weekend, and I rented a golf cart and was driving around, a motorized golf cart, at the Packed Port Aransas, and it was like a joke!
[01:08:48.522 --> 01:08:54.066]  I mean, here I am in a t-shirt and shorts, I'm driving, and I've been recognized for 10 years places, but
[01:08:55.862 --> 01:08:59.484]  As I was going, every 10 cars, every 5 cars, Alex Jones, Alex Jones!
[01:08:59.885 --> 01:09:02.066]  Everywhere we went to eat, we got recognized.
[01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:04.067]  And that's just a gauge.
[01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:08.049]  And I can go to England, I can go to Central America, I can be in Canada.
[01:09:08.530 --> 01:09:11.992]  Everywhere, we're getting, I mean like every 10 people I walk by are recognizing.
[01:09:12.292 --> 01:09:13.533]  And again, that's a gauge.
[01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:21.482]  Here you are feeling like you're all alone, and others, and then you find out that major heads of architect societies are on the same side.
[01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:27.209]  Again, we just have to show ourselves, not let the chilling effect scare us into submission.
[01:09:27.249 --> 01:09:28.390]  I talk to so many neighbors.
[01:09:28.991 --> 01:09:32.614]  That go, yeah, I'd like our kids to play together, but won't the government do something to me?
[01:09:32.954 --> 01:09:35.956]  Or, I've wanted to order your videos, but won't they, you know, won't I be on a list?
[01:09:36.437 --> 01:09:41.100]  Or, yeah, and my wife runs into these people at swim meets and things.
[01:09:42.181 --> 01:09:45.023]  You know, middle class people, well-to-do folks, folks like that.
[01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:46.905]  Again, you're already living in tyranny.
[01:09:46.985 --> 01:09:48.046]  Yes, they're watching us.
[01:09:48.106 --> 01:09:49.126]  Yes, they're tracking us.
[01:09:49.407 --> 01:09:51.568]  But the government's full of our people, too.
[01:09:52.209 --> 01:09:52.949]  This is a fight.
[01:09:52.989 --> 01:09:55.631]  If we let the chilling effect win, they're going to win.
[01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.373]  I love how you've just doggedly
[01:09:57.793 --> 01:10:04.657]  Through all the attacks, everything just continued, and you're having success, success, success, just like Stephen Jones and others.
[01:10:05.137 --> 01:10:08.139]  Professor Stephen Jones, who sent me a nice note, I want to say hi to him.
[01:10:08.159 --> 01:10:09.459]  He's listening right now from Germany.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.160]  Boy, he's got some big news coming up.
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.302]  So, sorry to interrupt there, it's just that this is amazing what's happening.
[01:10:15.343 --> 01:10:15.643]  Go ahead.
[01:10:16.643 --> 01:10:17.644]  Yeah, it is incredible.
[01:10:17.724 --> 01:10:21.446]  And so this particular leader of the AIA chapter,
[01:10:22.362 --> 01:10:25.483]  What was the response like, though, when you're there amongst the architects and engineers?
[01:10:44.227 --> 01:10:45.348]  Oh, it's amazing.
[01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:57.679]  I would say about 20, well 80% of them will stop and we'll invite them to stop.
[01:10:57.759 --> 01:10:58.400]  They do stop.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:03.545]  Many of them, 20% maybe, we figure walk by kind of shaking their heads.
[01:11:03.925 --> 01:11:06.267]  But the majority will stop and actually talk to us.
[01:11:06.487 --> 01:11:08.269]  Of those, we were able to get
[01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:20.660]  Very lively, and I mean positive lively, conversations going, because once they actually see Building 7 go down, we've got them.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:27.706]  And a good percentage of them will say, this is incredible, I've got to look at this more, and we've signed up about 60 of them.
[01:11:28.406 --> 01:11:30.967]  Richard Gage, again, this is exponential.
[01:11:31.307 --> 01:11:33.548]  If you continue, we will rout the enemy.
[01:11:34.068 --> 01:11:35.988]  The mainstream media can't ignore this forever.
[01:11:36.008 --> 01:11:37.309]  We're going to play some of that clip.
[01:11:38.449 --> 01:11:44.071]  You're getting on more and more mainstream television with the facts as a degreed architect engineer.
[01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:49.533]  So we're going to come right back with Richard Gage, the founder and head of Architects Engineers Find Love and Truth.
[01:11:50.093 --> 01:11:50.753]  Stay with us.
[01:11:54.054 --> 01:11:56.615]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:11:57.242 --> 01:11:59.343]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:11:59.864 --> 01:12:06.868]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:12:07.435 --> 01:12:13.661]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:12:13.961 --> 01:12:15.863]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:12:16.003 --> 01:12:18.425]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:12:18.505 --> 01:12:29.455]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:12:30.076 --> 01:12:31.377]  It's not about left or right.
[01:12:31.758 --> 01:12:33.119]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:12:33.593 --> 01:12:39.917]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:12:40.497 --> 01:12:48.281]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:48.762 --> 01:12:49.922]  The Obama Deception.
[01:12:50.343 --> 01:12:51.603]  The people strike back.
[01:12:53.745 --> 01:12:57.407]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:12:57.807 --> 01:13:03.210]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds,
[01:13:03.692 --> 01:13:04.793]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:08.875]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:13:09.495 --> 01:13:22.743]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:13:23.303 --> 01:13:28.644]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:34.865]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:13:42.646 --> 01:13:44.827]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:13:44.847 --> 01:13:44.907]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:54.735 --> 01:13:55.156]  We're good to go.
[01:14:08.874 --> 01:14:11.237]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.
[01:14:11.477 --> 01:14:17.763]  Pepperspray.com is the only website you'll ever need for all of your non-lethal self-defense supplies.

[01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.211]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[01:14:55.371 --> 01:15:04.497]  We have received news the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[01:15:04.877 --> 01:15:12.721]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[01:15:12.901 --> 01:15:18.825]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[01:15:19.705 --> 01:15:20.265]  We're good to go.
[01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:48.414]  If you owe 10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[01:15:48.634 --> 01:15:49.495]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[01:15:51.716 --> 01:15:52.336]  Call today.
[01:15:56.198 --> 01:16:02.242]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:16:02.842 --> 01:16:05.804]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:16:10.475 --> 01:16:13.016]  Richard Gates, let's start blasting into it now.
[01:16:13.476 --> 01:16:19.457]  You know, the evidence of the control demolition, people know those basics, but the evidence now has been looked at.
[01:16:19.537 --> 01:16:28.659]  Peer-reviewed journals, other top engineers, scientists, physicists around the world are coming out doing their own research, separate, verifying your research.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.201]  The other architects and engineers in your group, the other physicists, Professor Stephen Jones' information being verified.
[01:16:35.021 --> 01:16:38.322]  Major universities, I mean, this has really got to worry
[01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:48.909]  The establishment to the point of, for those that don't know, this is in Politico today, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, Obama, I am aware that some question
[01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:52.419]  Or justify the events of 9-11.
[01:16:53.499 --> 01:16:57.701]  So they either justified saying it was good, he tries to mix those two.
[01:16:58.261 --> 01:17:02.623]  So now if you say the government did 9-11 or was involved, you want 9-11 to happen.
[01:17:02.683 --> 01:17:09.506]  See how that's a quote, I am aware that some question, question or justify the events of 9-11.
[01:17:10.527 --> 01:17:12.968]  Wait a minute, questioning the events of 9-11 isn't justifying.
[01:17:13.945 --> 01:17:16.447]  See, that's, oh, you like the killers, huh?
[01:17:16.827 --> 01:17:19.049]  No, I'm saying, why is that building falling that way?
[01:17:19.409 --> 01:17:20.610]  Shut up, Al-Qaeda!
[01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:22.792]  Well, actually, Al-Qaeda is a CIA creation.
[01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:23.933]  Shut up, Al-Qaeda!
[01:17:23.953 --> 01:17:26.955]  You know, this is the mindlessness they like to engage in.
[01:17:27.315 --> 01:17:29.236]  We're just asking the serious questions here.
[01:17:29.657 --> 01:17:32.099]  So they're really starting to get worried, just like George Bush saying,
[01:17:32.699 --> 01:17:37.542]  Those that put out outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the events of 9-11.
[01:17:37.682 --> 01:17:40.184]  He told people they better shut up, but they didn't.
[01:17:40.885 --> 01:17:45.568]  Sir Richard Gage, it's getting exciting what's happening on the scientific front.
[01:17:46.877 --> 01:17:49.678]  Yeah, it is.
[01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:57.300]  The 700 architects and engineers that I represent are technical and building professionals, not conspiracy theorists.
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.741]  Not that there aren't conspiracies out there.
[01:17:59.781 --> 01:18:02.221]  There obviously is a conspiracy.
[01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:05.582]  In fact, we know the official story is a conspiracy.
[01:18:05.762 --> 01:18:08.183]  Actually, it turns out to be an outrageous one.
[01:18:09.103 --> 01:18:15.505]  When you look at the facts, the scientific forensic facts found at the crime scene of the destruction of these three high-rises,
[01:18:16.586 --> 01:18:24.713]  You find facts that all seem to line up in support of the theory of explosive control demolition.
[01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:26.435]  That's the science that we're looking at.
[01:18:26.915 --> 01:18:35.664]  And so the architects, as I mentioned, are first dumbfounded by the free-fall acceleration of Building 7.
[01:18:36.164 --> 01:18:38.887]  And this is acknowledged by the government, actually.
[01:18:39.187 --> 01:18:45.410]  I tried at first, NIST denied it, but you guys confronted them and they have to admit the building did free fall.
[01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:51.573]  It wasn't fuel oil, it wasn't Keebler Elves, it wasn't structural failure because of bad building.
[01:18:51.753 --> 01:18:52.554]  They don't know.
[01:18:52.814 --> 01:18:55.175]  Then they made up a magic thermal expansion.
[01:18:56.323 --> 01:19:01.666]  And if thermal expansion is their magic bullet.
[01:19:03.027 --> 01:19:08.970]  First of all, they claim that there are massive fires on floors 12 and 13 during the last couple hours of the building.
[01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:15.013]  But the photos and videos show those fires out in that area the last hour and a half of the building.
[01:19:15.653 --> 01:19:20.415]  And this is in the area of Column 79 under the East Penthouse.
[01:19:20.715 --> 01:19:27.817]  So this new phenomenon is what they call a thermal expansion, because of these massive fires that weren't even there.
[01:19:28.058 --> 01:19:37.341]  But they expanded these long-span 50-foot beams, pushing the girder off of its seat, off of Column 79, causing a floor failure.
[01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:43.433]  Well, five set to nine floor failures, leaving column 79 unbuckled.
[01:19:43.733 --> 01:19:51.657]  So what then happens is an internal cascading and failure of the building a few seconds prior to the overall building coming down.
[01:19:51.717 --> 01:19:58.241]  The problem is, is that that would require 400 structural steel connections to fail per second.
[01:19:58.621 --> 01:20:05.605]  And their model shows, actually, like sand, just all of these beams just giving up the ghost all of a sudden.
[01:20:07.086 --> 01:20:18.194]  Which is ridiculous in the few, as you know, as an architect engineer, but for those that don't, there have been a few older buildings where small areas have collapsed, none of the main structure, and that's how it is.
[01:20:18.254 --> 01:20:19.716]  It's not symmetrical.
[01:20:19.996 --> 01:20:28.042]  You don't have a building with unsymmetrical fires that couldn't bring it down anyways, magically falling straight down, unless it's, boom, a controlled demolition.
[01:20:28.533 --> 01:20:47.784]  Well, in order to bring a building straight down symmetrically into its own footprint and at freefall acceleration, you have to take out at least the core columns, there's 24 of them, within a tenth of a second of each other, precisely timed synchronistically floor by floor.
[01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:56.150]  The fire doesn't have this level of precision, and people really get that part of it as well.
[01:20:56.170 --> 01:20:56.590]  Exactly.
[01:20:56.650 --> 01:21:00.293]  Jawas didn't attack the Sandcrawler, but we're made to think they did.
[01:21:00.673 --> 01:21:02.695]  Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise.
[01:21:04.386 --> 01:21:20.909]  Yes, and so, the acknowledged, most previously actually acknowledged, this is the National Institute for Standards and Technology responsible for the report, they previously acknowledged that if the building did freefall, that would mean there would be no structure.
[01:21:21.289 --> 01:21:29.351]  Now they acknowledge the freefall, but they don't acknowledge the implications that those columns had to have been forcibly removed in order to facilitate it.
[01:21:31.917 --> 01:21:32.878]  All right, stay there.
[01:21:32.958 --> 01:21:33.558]  Stay there, Richard.
[01:21:33.578 --> 01:21:34.178]  Gotta come back.
[01:21:34.198 --> 01:21:37.560]  We're gonna come back and talk about more of the evidence and all the science building.
[01:21:38.621 --> 01:21:42.623]  How you see the crisis coming up in the future of the establishment story.
[01:21:43.904 --> 01:21:44.785]  We're on the march.
[01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:46.886]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:47.826 --> 01:21:50.528]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:58.513]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:21:58.733 --> 01:22:02.516]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:22:02.756 --> 01:22:08.360]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:09.120]  It's true.
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:13.523]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:22:13.723 --> 01:22:20.088]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:20.708]  Number four,
[01:22:20.928 --> 01:22:23.592]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:22:23.832 --> 01:22:27.097]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:22:27.117 --> 01:22:31.223]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[01:22:36.371 --> 01:22:37.693]  A long time sponsor of ours.

[01:22:55.845 --> 01:23:00.449]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:23:00.589 --> 01:23:03.331]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:23:03.551 --> 01:23:06.413]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:23:06.593 --> 01:23:12.477]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:23:12.677 --> 01:23:15.640]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.862]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food

[01:25:06.323 --> 01:25:07.644]  And everybody does know!
[01:25:31.233 --> 01:25:32.414]  They are awakening.
[01:25:33.014 --> 01:25:35.136]  So why are we all cowed and afraid?
[01:25:35.436 --> 01:25:37.457]  The government will get me if I speak up or stand up.
[01:25:37.918 --> 01:25:38.278]  No!
[01:25:38.998 --> 01:25:41.080]  This is mafia, tyranny, corruption.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.981]  Government's growing like a cancer.
[01:25:43.081 --> 01:25:44.322]  We are saying no.
[01:25:44.862 --> 01:25:46.683]  Just as our forebears did 230 plus years ago in 1776.
[01:25:49.705 --> 01:25:51.427]  By the way, you want to meet like-minded people?
[01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:54.791]  You want to wear your liberty on your sleeve, getting everybody's face about it?
[01:25:55.112 --> 01:25:56.433]  Say, hey, we're not ashamed of this.
[01:25:56.694 --> 01:25:57.455]  You're the criminals.
[01:25:57.795 --> 01:25:58.976]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:25:58.997 --> 01:26:00.659]  We've produced 14 new shirts.
[01:26:00.939 --> 01:26:03.602]  We're adding new ones every week in the last few months.
[01:26:03.722 --> 01:26:06.325]  And this is my favorite, really.
[01:26:07.452 --> 01:26:11.836]  I kind of like the Gadsden flag, yellow, don't tread on me too, but live free or die.
[01:26:12.237 --> 01:26:19.163]  This is the very shirt I was wearing this weekend in Port Aransas at 9.30 at night buying this pad of paper and some milk and stuff.
[01:26:20.379 --> 01:26:38.015]  And the security guard came up and looked at my shirt and looked on the back and acted all scared, and people on the beach when I was walking would see it and either like it or be scared, especially cop types with their wives out walking on the beach, because they've all been told in the DHS report that's coming up with Glenn Beck now that we're terrorists, folks.
[01:26:38.215 --> 01:26:44.401]  Glenn Beck can use these symbols and say big government, police states, what it symbolizes, but when we use these symbols and tell you what it really means,
[01:26:44.961 --> 01:26:47.263]  Liberty, sovereignty, the truth, second amendment.
[01:26:47.623 --> 01:26:48.604]  They're not going to put up with that.
[01:26:48.644 --> 01:26:54.348]  So we got this t-shirt and a lot of others available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:26:54.368 --> 01:26:54.408]  888-253-3139.
[01:26:54.428 --> 01:26:59.031]  We have these in your face things that say live free or die with Paul Revere on the front.
[01:27:06.136 --> 01:27:08.659]  And Infowars.com on the back, so radical!
[01:27:09.119 --> 01:27:11.102]  And the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me!
[01:27:11.582 --> 01:27:22.414]  But if that's too radical for you, we have stuff like the answer to 1984, 1776, and things that are a little less radical, evil free speech, and of course the Obama deception detailing
[01:27:22.894 --> 01:27:26.636]  Barack Obama really is the preeminent film exposing this guy.
[01:27:26.876 --> 01:27:27.756]  Have viewing parties.
[01:27:27.796 --> 01:27:29.137]  Show it to your church or school.
[01:27:29.437 --> 01:27:30.997]  Show it to your liberal conservative friends.
[01:27:31.358 --> 01:27:32.918]  It exposes the right and the left.
[01:27:32.958 --> 01:27:34.499]  Shows it's a controlled paradigm.
[01:27:34.519 --> 01:27:36.940]  That's why this film is number one online right now.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.721]  Get it in high quality on DVD with all the extras.
[01:27:39.961 --> 01:27:42.582]  See it in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:27:42.942 --> 01:27:46.624]  And by the way, we just put out the Aaron Russo film available on DVD.
[01:27:46.704 --> 01:27:49.425]  It's a presentation of the interview I did with him before he died.
[01:27:49.865 --> 01:27:51.065]  It's already put out for free on the web.
[01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:52.226]  It has the added extra
[01:27:52.606 --> 01:27:56.307]  Interview that we hadn't put out, and an update commentary from myself.
[01:27:56.627 --> 01:27:58.548]  Reflections and Warnings interview with Aaron Russo.
[01:27:58.888 --> 01:28:00.709]  That's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:04.810]  We're carrying American Freedom from Fascism again, and his Mad As Hell video.
[01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:10.732]  Great material that needs to be seen that everybody's library needs, and your purchases support this show and what we're doing.
[01:28:10.772 --> 01:28:13.713]  So please get Reflections and Warnings interview with Aaron Russo.
[01:28:14.053 --> 01:28:16.854]  That's also up there in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:28:17.967 --> 01:28:33.993]  And tomorrow, we're going to launch at PrisonPlanet.TV, expanded extras from the Obama deception, 30 minutes of behind-the-scenes Bilderberg 2008, and a bunch of other stuff that's really hot stuff that hit the cutting room floor.
[01:28:34.693 --> 01:28:36.494]  Because we couldn't make the film three hours long.
[01:28:36.834 --> 01:28:39.735]  That's going up for PrisonPlanet.tv members tomorrow night.
[01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:46.839]  So if you don't have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, folks, now is the time to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:28:47.259 --> 01:28:52.581]  And again, your PrisonPlanet.tv membership also makes this radio show possible, what we do here every day.
[01:28:52.601 --> 01:28:58.244]  We also simulcast for PrisonPlanet.tv members at least two hours, usually three hours, like I'm doing today.
[01:28:58.884 --> 01:29:00.024]  Okay, let's go back to Richard Gage.
[01:29:00.064 --> 01:29:09.527]  Richard, we're almost out of time because I want to play the clip of you on Fresno TV, at least part of it, and I want to cover some other news before Gerald Salente joins us next hour on the economy.
[01:29:24.691 --> 01:29:30.916]  Again, going over the evidence, it's incontrovertible, it's been peer-reviewed, this is really upsetting the debunkers.
[01:29:31.436 --> 01:29:35.899]  And I know you've taken a lot of threats and things, and I just want to commend your spirit.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.221]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:38.241 --> 01:29:43.605]  I haven't actually received threats, but... Well, really, I've seen the threats on the web, do you?
[01:29:45.595 --> 01:29:46.777]  Well, don't forward him to me.
[01:29:46.877 --> 01:29:47.978]  I don't want to see him then.
[01:29:50.701 --> 01:29:58.649]  I'm happy in my blissful mission here of educating architects, and I don't actually go to the debunker websites.
[01:29:58.749 --> 01:29:59.290]  I don't want to.
[01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:01.452]  But you have gotten a lot of bizarre phone calls and things.
[01:30:02.884 --> 01:30:06.607]  Well, no, actually, I haven't gotten any phone calls.
[01:30:06.647 --> 01:30:12.912]  Nobody really knows my phone number, as a matter of fact, or where I live, which is the way I want it.
[01:30:13.532 --> 01:30:15.754]  I thought I talked to you in the past.
[01:30:15.814 --> 01:30:19.256]  I thought you said that it happened, but I'm glad I must be thinking of somebody else, but go ahead.
[01:30:24.677 --> 01:30:29.381]  I just wanted to introduce, you brought up the concept of these peer-reviewed papers.
[01:30:29.441 --> 01:30:33.084]  Dr. Jones' work is so important here.
[01:30:34.065 --> 01:30:39.870]  Several first responders, iron workers, and others have found this molten metal underneath all three
[01:30:41.011 --> 01:30:48.216]  High-rise buildings after the collapses, and in fact it's pouring out of the side of the South Tower, and it turns out to be molten iron.
[01:30:48.256 --> 01:30:51.298]  Dr. Jones has confirmed that this is not melted structural steel.
[01:30:51.578 --> 01:31:00.985]  He's confirmed that it has in it the evidence, the chemical evidence, of thermite, an incendiary used by the military to cut through steel like a hot knife through butter.
[01:31:01.405 --> 01:31:08.310]  And not only does molten metal have in it this iron, aluminum, oxygen, fluorine,
[01:31:08.710 --> 01:31:09.230]  Manganese.
[01:31:09.591 --> 01:31:14.954]  But the spheres that you've talked about on your show before are ubiquitous.
[01:31:15.114 --> 01:31:17.896]  Millions, billions of them throughout the dust samples.
[01:31:18.316 --> 01:31:21.798]  And independent scientists with independent samples have confirmed this.
[01:31:21.858 --> 01:31:22.559]  In fact, R.J.
[01:31:22.619 --> 01:31:25.981]  Lee has confirmed molten iron spheres smaller than a human hair.
[01:31:26.101 --> 01:31:37.348]  Now they put them through these, what, spectrographs, or what are these different tools that electrons scan, and it all has the exact chemical makeup of the byproducts of thermate, thermite.
[01:31:37.628 --> 01:31:40.550]  Then they even find thermite chips separately!
[01:31:41.226 --> 01:31:53.969]  Well, that's the big step, and Dr. Jones has found hundreds and hundreds of these chips in the samples, and by weight, he estimates that there'd be nine tons of this unignited thermite.
[01:31:54.209 --> 01:32:05.712]  And there's even more ignited thermite spheres, but the unignited thermite chips turn out to be extremely small particles of aluminum and iron oxide and other particles a thousand times smaller than a human hair.
[01:32:06.232 --> 01:32:07.853]  And then people ask, how could this happen?
[01:32:07.873 --> 01:32:09.514]  These were all spook run buildings.
[01:32:09.755 --> 01:32:15.119]  Building 7 was the FBI, CIA, Defense Intelligence, and other agencies command center.
[01:32:15.359 --> 01:32:27.388]  It had the FEMA emergency bunker, the city and county and state emergency bunker, and they had special unconventional insulation put on the pillars a few years before, and then the NIST
[01:32:27.968 --> 01:32:42.581]  Experts that try to debunk you, they just so happen to be the world leading experts of just a few dozen, just so happen to be the NASA experts in explosive thermite for cutting through things and for NASA rocket decouplers.
[01:32:43.121 --> 01:32:48.226]  Oh, very interesting to have the experts in explosive thermite involved in debunking you.
[01:32:48.766 --> 01:32:52.649]  Yes, and you can read about that, your listeners, on journalof911studies.com.
[01:32:54.713 --> 01:32:56.754]  That's a fascinating topic as well.
[01:32:57.054 --> 01:33:09.360]  Kevin Ryan exposes this, and the 25-page peer-reviewed paper by Dr. Jones, Neal Parrott, and other scientists document nanothermite.
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.881]  This is extremely high-tech stuff.
[01:33:12.321 --> 01:33:17.784]  It is made only in Defense Department contracting laboratories, not in a cave in Afghanistan.
[01:33:20.359 --> 01:33:24.504]  Yeah, it just so happens to match up with what the Defense Department's obsessed with.
[01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:31.392]  But you know, Al-Qaeda got up in the buildings and they got this Defense Department thermite and put it in there.
[01:33:31.632 --> 01:33:34.796]  Kind of like Defense Department, super weaponized grade, U.S.
[01:33:34.856 --> 01:33:37.499]  patented, miniaturized, coated in bentonite.
[01:33:37.839 --> 01:33:56.249]  Gets mailed out, they claim Muslims do it, but it turns out the White House is on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic, on September 10th, three and a half weeks before anthrax pops up, and all of Bush's enemies get sent the anthrax, and Congress gets personally shut down, partially shut down, so they can then be under fear to pass the Patriot Act.
[01:33:56.909 --> 01:34:00.551]  Again, there's no evidence the government's involved, is there Mr. Gage?
[01:34:03.278 --> 01:34:06.979]  Well, we're not going to point the finger, but you can.
[01:34:07.699 --> 01:34:13.640]  It turns out that the Al-Qaeda was clearly unlikely to have access to this stuff as well.
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:19.401]  They couldn't get access, most likely, to the... Al-Qaeda didn't have the NASA explosives?
[01:34:19.522 --> 01:34:19.922]  Okay.
[01:34:20.602 --> 01:34:22.182]  I thought they got it at Cape Canaveral.
[01:34:22.942 --> 01:34:26.583]  I mean, Al-Qaeda's got a base at Cape Canaveral.
[01:34:27.011 --> 01:34:32.834]  Nor did they have access to these three of the highly most secure buildings in the United States outside the Pentagon.
[01:34:33.134 --> 01:34:36.435]  You mean Al Qaeda didn't have keys to the CIA command bunker in Building 7?
[01:34:37.136 --> 01:34:39.237]  Well, they may have been given them, perhaps.
[01:34:39.717 --> 01:34:40.237]  I don't know.
[01:34:42.118 --> 01:34:43.859]  You know, that's a wild conspiracy theory.
[01:34:43.899 --> 01:34:50.762]  I think it's normal that they snuck in with NASA-grade explosives all over the buildings by themselves and didn't get caught.
[01:34:51.656 --> 01:34:57.380]  And of course, I think it's no big deal that a spook command base building 7 blows up like this and falls at free fall.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.422]  Richard, I think you're an extremist for even questioning this.
[01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:02.923]  Why don't you just believe the story?
[01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:04.264]  I can't.
[01:35:04.484 --> 01:35:06.105]  In fact, I'm not even working anymore.
[01:35:06.125 --> 01:35:14.791]  I'm earning half the salary working for architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth that I was full-time as an architect, but I don't have time to be an architect anymore.
[01:35:14.811 --> 01:35:15.191]  That's right.
[01:35:15.531 --> 01:35:20.034]  You built some big buildings and you had a pretty successful business.
[01:35:20.054 --> 01:35:20.815]  Tell folks about that.
[01:35:21.223 --> 01:35:30.129]  Well, I was helping to manage a $400 million project in Nevada for General Growth, one of the largest mall firms.
[01:35:30.209 --> 01:35:37.654]  And this had 1,200 tons of steel framing in six malls, basically, in a row.
[01:35:38.610 --> 01:35:40.452]  Including a mid-rise office space.
[01:35:40.912 --> 01:35:42.053]  This deal is up!
[01:35:42.313 --> 01:35:51.341]  The developers are bankrupt and 18 of us were laid off on this project which turned out to be a blessing because I just didn't have time for it.
[01:35:51.661 --> 01:36:02.670]  I was working fewer and fewer hours trying to keep up with my speaking schedule and the research and the effort, the marketing effort that we're trying to educate all of the architects and engineers.
[01:36:04.088 --> 01:36:04.588]  Amazing.
[01:36:04.648 --> 01:36:10.131]  Tell us about this news clip I'm about to play, because you're getting on more and more mainstream television and they're being somewhat respectful.
[01:36:10.752 --> 01:36:18.256]  Well, let me tell you that the incredible, hard-working folks at We Are Change Fresno, a new We Are Change chapter,
[01:36:18.826 --> 01:36:19.146]  I'm not sure.
[01:36:35.732 --> 01:36:41.796]  We try to do this, but it takes a lot of effort, a lot of contact, a lot of pressure, and consistent.
[01:36:42.536 --> 01:36:43.557]  And they broke through.
[01:36:43.637 --> 01:36:52.282]  We were able to get on The Great Day Show, which is broadcast throughout Central California, on Fox Affiliate.
[01:36:52.342 --> 01:36:53.823]  So, it's pretty incredible.
[01:36:53.843 --> 01:37:00.968]  It's a seven and a half minute interview, which was very positive, where I was able, I feel, to get out most of this evidence.
[01:37:01.448 --> 01:37:07.474]  We're going to let you go in a moment and play that, and we'll have you back up in the near future to chronicle the great work you're doing all over the world.
[01:37:07.514 --> 01:37:09.997]  You travel in Europe and Canada and the United States.
[01:37:10.317 --> 01:37:12.179]  People should go to the website and support you.
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:23.451]  And the last question, are the people on the other side, who we're now discovering literally have the hands on the plungers, the evidence shows,
[01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:31.624]  How do you deal with the creepiness of some of the events you and Stephen Jones and others go to where you've confronted these people and how do you deal
[01:37:32.779 --> 01:37:40.561]  With also knowing that you and others are making history, that your momentum and your evidence is really changing things.
[01:37:40.581 --> 01:37:42.961]  Because I'm starting to see a lot of fear in their eyes.
[01:37:43.301 --> 01:37:52.383]  They realize this is like Galileo, you know, arguing that the planets moved and they locked him up for it, but later it came out that he was right, even before he died.
[01:37:52.763 --> 01:37:56.844]  Or Copernicus before him, you know, saying that the Earth was round.
[01:37:57.584 --> 01:37:59.865]  I mean, they're in deep trouble because the science is on your side.
[01:38:00.868 --> 01:38:02.529]  Yeah, and the numbers are too.
[01:38:03.349 --> 01:38:07.431]  Our architects and engineers are growing and we're going to be presenting this petition to Congress.
[01:38:07.471 --> 01:38:12.953]  We hope to have a thousand by October when we go out there to Washington, D.C.
[01:38:13.793 --> 01:38:16.494]  Personally, I'm delighted.
[01:38:16.554 --> 01:38:19.636]  I'm fired up every time we get a new breakthrough in the media.
[01:38:20.296 --> 01:38:22.957]  I'm incredibly delighted.
[01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:24.558]  In fact, we're going to be on coast-to-coast AM.
[01:38:25.792 --> 01:38:28.694]  Uh, Tuesday, uh, night at 11 p.m.
[01:38:28.954 --> 01:38:30.115]  Pacific time.
[01:38:30.856 --> 01:38:34.218]  Uh, and that's, that's been nationally syndicated like your show.
[01:38:34.258 --> 01:38:36.079]  We're just making some incredible progress.
[01:38:36.099 --> 01:38:37.980]  And that can't be... Well, that show's a lot bigger than this one.
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:39.761]  It's got, it's the second biggest show in the country.
[01:38:39.942 --> 01:38:46.786]  And in fact, I heard George during the news segment a few weeks ago cover the peer-reviewed journals about the thermite and the chips and the rest of it.
[01:38:46.826 --> 01:38:48.387]  So, more and more is happening.
[01:38:48.828 --> 01:38:51.609]  Richard Gage, I want to commend you for all you do.
[01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:53.531]  And we'll, uh, talk to you again very soon.
[01:38:53.571 --> 01:38:55.412]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna let you go and play this clip.
[01:38:55.892 --> 01:38:56.733]  Thanks, great Alex.
[01:38:56.894 --> 01:38:57.174]  I'll listen.
[01:38:57.734 --> 01:38:58.676]  Thank you so much, Richard.
[01:38:59.076 --> 01:38:59.757]  Okay, yeah.
[01:38:59.777 --> 01:39:01.218]  Go ahead and start rolling the clip.
[01:39:01.239 --> 01:39:02.700]  We'll go to Bright and come back and play the rest.
[01:39:03.021 --> 01:39:05.684]  Here is a pretty fair report broadcast all over California.
[01:39:05.704 --> 01:39:06.104]  Here it is.
[01:39:07.105 --> 01:39:09.548]  He's an architect experienced in steel structures.
[01:39:09.628 --> 01:39:13.673]  Now Richard Gage is touring the country with a controversial message about September 11th.
[01:39:13.933 --> 01:39:15.595]  Richard Gage is here to show us why.
[01:39:15.635 --> 01:39:16.356]  He's calling for...
[01:39:16.812 --> 01:39:20.614]  A more thorough investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings.
[01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:21.755]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:39:21.955 --> 01:39:22.656]  You're very welcome.
[01:39:22.696 --> 01:39:23.276]  It's great to be here.
[01:39:23.396 --> 01:39:25.778]  Well, first of all, give us a little bit more about your background.
[01:39:26.238 --> 01:39:34.463]  I'm an architect of 20 years, a member of the American Institute of Architects, and I've been studying steel frame fireproof buildings for about that long.
[01:39:35.884 --> 01:39:43.849]  We ask that for clarification, because as we get into this, we want people to make sure that you're not just somebody with a wacky idea.
[01:39:43.989 --> 01:39:44.249]  Right.
[01:39:44.269 --> 01:39:44.489]  Okay?
[01:39:44.509 --> 01:39:45.850]  You come with some science to you.
[01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:49.812]  What is the official reason for the collapse of the World Trade Center Tower?
[01:39:49.852 --> 01:40:03.037]  Well, we're told that the planes hit the buildings and there was an explosion and a fire and about an hour and a half later, in the case of the North Tower, the buildings collapsed due to structural weakening due to the fires.
[01:40:03.834 --> 01:40:17.543]  The problem is, is that we don't have large gradual deformations associated with collapses, and fires in high-rises have never brought down a steel frame of high-rise building, at all, ever.
[01:40:18.063 --> 01:40:26.889]  And what we have, unfortunately, is the evidence in the Twin Towers and the third skyscraper to collapse that day, which most people don't know anything about it.
[01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:30.952]  We have the evidence of the ten key features of controlled demolition.
[01:40:31.519 --> 01:40:39.601]  In the case of Building 7, it collapses straight down into its own footprint at free-fall speed in the first 100 feet.
[01:40:40.261 --> 01:40:47.582]  It's dropping, as you can see, symmetrically, smoothly, at free-fall speed in the first 100 feet.
[01:40:47.782 --> 01:40:48.623]  Two and a half seconds.
[01:40:49.083 --> 01:40:49.863]  This is uncanny.
[01:40:49.903 --> 01:40:54.484]  There's 40,000 tons of structural steel designed to resist this collapse.
[01:40:54.504 --> 01:40:56.124]  What, a 47-story building?
[01:40:56.204 --> 01:40:56.444]  Yeah!
[01:40:56.464 --> 01:40:58.244]  This is called Building 7, right?
[01:40:58.445 --> 01:41:00.445]  A football field away from the Twin Towers.
[01:41:01.138 --> 01:41:04.063]  Okay, so what we're showing is what happened in fact.
[01:41:04.543 --> 01:41:05.505]  I want to throw a point in here.
[01:41:05.785 --> 01:41:07.869]  Then they, first they said there was no free fall and they admit it.
[01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:09.371]  Okay, first 100, 150, it is free fall.
[01:41:09.391 --> 01:41:10.352]  At free fall.
[01:41:11.826 --> 01:41:13.588]  Then they go, but the last couple hundred it didn't.
[01:41:14.208 --> 01:41:16.470]  That's because it's now piling up on itself.
[01:41:17.031 --> 01:41:20.995]  But it's barely falling slower than free fall after that point.
[01:41:21.215 --> 01:41:24.238]  Then they measure that with other control demos, it's exactly the same.
[01:41:24.798 --> 01:41:27.241]  That was done conventionally with a control demo.
[01:41:27.721 --> 01:41:30.724]  Tower 1 and 2 were blown up the opposite way, top down.
[01:41:31.024 --> 01:41:31.765]  Let's go back to it.
[01:41:33.376 --> 01:41:34.157]  This is uncanny.
[01:41:34.197 --> 01:41:38.500]  There's 40,000 tons of structural steel designed to resist this collapse.
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:40.401]  Is it, what, a 47-story building?
[01:41:40.521 --> 01:41:40.742]  Yeah.
[01:41:40.982 --> 01:41:42.543]  This is called Building 7, right?
[01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:44.925]  A football field away from the Twin Towers.
[01:41:45.465 --> 01:41:47.827]  Okay, so what we're showing is left what happened.
[01:41:47.967 --> 01:41:54.492]  In fact, right is a controlled, where you are using, or the people who made this happen, used demolition.
[01:41:54.512 --> 01:41:57.354]  Indeed, and this is a direct comparison.
[01:41:57.785 --> 01:42:03.826]  And you can see that, indeed, almost free-fall speed, free-fall acceleration through 40,000 tons of structural steel.
[01:42:04.307 --> 01:42:05.347]  That is uncanny.
[01:42:05.387 --> 01:42:13.849]  So we have 700 architects and engineers demanding a new investigation as a result of this evidence and the evidence in the World Trade Center.
[01:42:14.249 --> 01:42:15.589]  That is very explosive.
[01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:20.951]  Almost every architect and engineer we show this information to agrees with us that these are controlled demolitions.
[01:42:21.451 --> 01:42:22.571]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:42:22.591 --> 01:42:24.151]  I'm going to come back and play the rest.
[01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:25.712]  I'm going to go to Glenn Beck and then Gerald Cilente.
[01:42:27.096 --> 01:42:35.883]  Folks, think of the courage of these 700 women and men, like the Founding Fathers signing their John Hancocks on that piece of paper.
[01:42:36.203 --> 01:42:40.687]  And like he said, everybody, 90% you talk to, they're afraid to sign.
[01:42:42.369 --> 01:42:44.951]  We have to step up to the plate.
[01:42:45.011 --> 01:42:47.754]  We have to say, I'm not afraid, I'm a patriot.
[01:42:47.954 --> 01:42:51.977]  That's the first big step in winning against the New World Order is stop cowering.
[01:42:51.997 --> 01:42:52.898]  They want to intimidate you.
[01:42:52.998 --> 01:42:53.599]  Get past the fear.
[01:42:53.619 --> 01:42:54.119]  Don't worry.
[01:42:54.279 --> 01:42:56.341]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:42:56.621 --> 01:42:56.902]  Hi.
[01:42:57.162 --> 01:42:59.624]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:42:59.944 --> 01:43:04.187]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:43:04.488 --> 01:43:06.669]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:10.012]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:43:10.312 --> 01:43:12.033]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:43:12.254 --> 01:43:14.756]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:43:15.036 --> 01:43:18.438]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:22.842]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:43:23.162 --> 01:43:26.905]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:43:27.245 --> 01:43:33.247]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:43:33.567 --> 01:43:35.728]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:43:35.928 --> 01:43:37.609]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[01:43:38.049 --> 01:43:42.250]  So go to upthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:43:42.710 --> 01:43:43.351]  Start now.
[01:43:43.611 --> 01:43:44.571]  Knowledge is power.
[01:43:45.331 --> 01:43:46.132]  Better take action.
[01:43:46.332 --> 01:43:47.292]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:43:53.544 --> 01:43:54.885]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:43:55.065 --> 01:44:00.046]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[01:44:00.447 --> 01:44:02.527]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[01:44:02.868 --> 01:44:11.971]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout grid.
[01:44:12.351 --> 01:44:19.095]  This program has already settled over 100 million dollars of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.
[01:44:19.415 --> 01:44:25.558]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments, the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[01:44:25.738 --> 01:44:28.499]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:32.221]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.
[01:44:32.461 --> 01:44:37.824]  The call is free and in 10 minutes they will show you how much you can save right over the phone with one simple call.
[01:44:38.064 --> 01:44:40.185]  Let the bailout group bail you out of debt.
[01:44:40.425 --> 01:44:44.688]  Reduce your payments by up to 60% and save you thousands of dollars today.
[01:44:44.929 --> 01:44:45.889]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554.
[01:44:45.909 --> 01:44:45.969]  800-324-6554.
[01:44:46.090 --> 01:44:46.430]  The Bailout Group.
[01:44:53.715 --> 01:44:57.696]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food.
[01:44:57.997 --> 01:45:02.098]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food.
[01:45:02.378 --> 01:45:06.660]  During the Great Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:13.082]  And as America continues down its current path, for many, the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[01:45:13.622 --> 01:45:20.971]  With massive layoffs and unemployment at record levels, growing your own food will help you save money that you'd normally spend at the grocery store.
[01:45:21.271 --> 01:45:27.398]  Invest in your family's future by stocking up with your very own supply of seeds available from GetSeeds.net.
[01:45:28.359 --> 01:45:28.639]  I think so.
[01:45:58.192 --> 01:46:00.094]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:46:00.574 --> 01:46:03.356]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:46:03.376 --> 01:46:12.803]  I'm going to play a little bit more of this TV newscast from Richard Gage out of California.
[01:46:12.883 --> 01:46:18.487]  Then I'm going to cover a little bit more about Glenn Beck coming out and saying the militia gun owner groups are working with Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:18.887 --> 01:46:25.112]  This is the new Obama pitch with the Department of Homeland Security saying veterans, gun owners are the number one terror threat and working with Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:26.598 --> 01:46:28.380]  This is the thing about outraged conservatives.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:31.383]  I mean, Beck is just really out of control, but he's following a script.
[01:46:32.084 --> 01:46:33.786]  Then we got Gerald Cilente coming up.
[01:46:33.846 --> 01:46:36.049]  I want to tell you about a sponsor quickly before we do that.
[01:46:36.609 --> 01:46:42.236]  They're efoodsdirect.com, a great storable foods company where I chose to get my storable foods before they were even a sponsor.
[01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:43.918]  That's why I approached them to be a sponsor.
[01:46:44.578 --> 01:46:47.522]  The longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[01:46:48.002 --> 01:46:49.044]  Other people claim they are.
[01:46:49.084 --> 01:46:49.704]  It's not true.
[01:46:49.965 --> 01:46:50.625]  This is the group.
[01:46:51.086 --> 01:47:05.744]  They are the biggest, they are the best, non-GMO, non-hybrid, clean, quality food, best prices, brand new food, not old stuff they're selling you from 10 years ago, last more than 10 years in climate controlled, 10 years if it's in your garage and not to climate controlled or in a
[01:47:06.244 --> 01:47:10.547]  Okay, let's go back to this video at PrisonPlanet.tv and on the radio with the audio.
[01:47:33.502 --> 01:47:39.245]  Of a pretty fair newscast that we're breaking down here with Richard Gage going over what really happened on 9-11.
[01:47:40.466 --> 01:47:45.268]  This evidence and the evidence in the World Trade Center, that is very explosive.
[01:47:45.388 --> 01:47:50.631]  Almost every architect and engineer we show this information to agrees with us that these are controlled demolitions.
[01:47:51.452 --> 01:47:56.834]  If we can get them to look at the information, because obviously the implications of a controlled demolition are dark.
[01:47:58.413 --> 01:47:59.114]  For our country.
[01:47:59.414 --> 01:48:01.976]  Because that means somebody besides Al-Qaeda was involved.
[01:48:01.996 --> 01:48:05.978]  Because these have to be, easily, three of the most highly secure buildings outside the Pentagon.
[01:48:06.118 --> 01:48:17.566]  Now, if that was a controlled demolition, would there not be any evidence at the ground level of explosives within the building itself, the debris that's left?
[01:48:17.726 --> 01:48:18.087]  Indeed.
[01:48:18.207 --> 01:48:20.769]  And what we find down there is pools of molten iron.
[01:48:20.989 --> 01:48:21.489]  What does that mean?
[01:48:21.529 --> 01:48:22.370]  Several tons.
[01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:23.250]  Exactly.
[01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:24.411]  What is that doing there?
[01:48:24.471 --> 01:48:26.853]  The first responders see it, the structural engineers see it.
[01:48:27.293 --> 01:48:29.554]  It's documented by FEMA, the melting of steel.
[01:48:29.974 --> 01:48:34.456]  Normal office fires is what's supposed to have brought these buildings down, along with jet plane impacts.
[01:48:34.776 --> 01:48:38.777]  The jet fuel and office fires don't produce molten iron or molten steel.
[01:48:39.138 --> 01:48:41.318]  It doesn't begin to melt until 3,000 degrees.
[01:48:41.679 --> 01:48:46.761]  But what we have is the fires only produce maybe 1,400, 1,600 degrees.
[01:48:47.141 --> 01:48:48.761]  So what produced all that molten iron?
[01:48:48.941 --> 01:48:53.123]  Well, it has in it the chemical evidence of a special incendiary.
[01:48:53.650 --> 01:48:58.094]  Uh, which is thermite, a high-tech incendiary used to cut through steel like a hot knife through butter.
[01:48:58.114 --> 01:48:58.415]  You found that?
[01:48:59.075 --> 01:48:59.475]  Indeed.
[01:48:59.716 --> 01:49:14.069]  In all of the dust throughout, uh, lower Manhattan, uh, we have a four to six inch thick layer of, of, of this dust and throughout it we have, uh, evidence of tiny spheres, billions of them, several tons.
[01:49:15.242 --> 01:49:16.983]  Of previously molten iron.
[01:49:17.103 --> 01:49:18.064]  Well, how does that happen?
[01:49:18.584 --> 01:49:24.788]  If you have molten iron, the byproduct of thermite is molten iron, and it's dispersed throughout all of this dust.
[01:49:24.888 --> 01:49:28.810]  Now, you are allowed to go in and get samples and examine it?
[01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:31.211]  Oh, there's plenty of dust.
[01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:38.315]  A lot of people have this dust, and four of these samples have been sent to physicist Stephen Jones, formerly of Brigham Young University.
[01:49:38.815 --> 01:49:41.677]  And they find in it, not only these spheres,
[01:49:42.388 --> 01:49:47.653]  Uh, which others have found too, USGS, RJ Lee, doing toxicological studies.
[01:49:48.534 --> 01:49:56.101]  These spheres have iron, aluminum, fluorine, manganese, very unusual elements associated only with thermite.
[01:49:56.381 --> 01:49:59.224]  And there's small chips of unignited thermite as well.
[01:49:59.584 --> 01:50:01.086]  This is very high-tech thermite.
[01:50:01.126 --> 01:50:02.827]  Yeah, let's stop right there.
[01:50:03.268 --> 01:50:04.649]  You can watch the rest of it on YouTube.
[01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:07.291]  We've got a link up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:08.112 --> 01:50:08.713]  That's key.
[01:50:09.313 --> 01:50:15.378]  The federal government and other branches found the spheres in the thermate and didn't know what they were and wrote them up in reports.
[01:50:15.838 --> 01:50:23.124]  That's key, because folks go, oh, Stephen Jones and other people, you know, they got these people that live nearby, construction workers, people that saved it.
[01:50:23.724 --> 01:50:25.606]  You know, there's not a chain of custody.
[01:50:26.086 --> 01:50:28.948]  Oh, I'm sorry, the federal government's own studies admit it all.
[01:50:29.749 --> 01:50:31.510]  They blew those buildings sky high.
[01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:36.034]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:41.321]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:50:43.323 --> 01:50:51.991]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:57.116]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:50:57.596 --> 01:51:00.159]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[01:51:00.579 --> 01:51:00.879]  I think so.
[01:51:19.847 --> 01:51:20.808]  We're good to go.
[01:51:46.167 --> 01:51:48.068]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:48.548 --> 01:51:51.470]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:51:55.071 --> 01:51:57.072]  Gold is up $16.70 today.
[01:51:57.313 --> 01:52:00.634]  I'm not gonna get too much into that.
[01:52:13.971 --> 01:52:25.865]  You know, really the biggest news of the day, that I covered some in the first hour, and that will come up in the rebroadcast after Gerald Solenta joins us, is the Washington Times' exclusive Al-Qaeda says bio-attack from Mexico.
[01:52:26.145 --> 01:52:30.431]  I was on neocon sites months ago with this government operative.
[01:52:32.424 --> 01:52:36.065]  sitting up there saying, oh yes, we're going to ship anthrax in.
[01:52:36.225 --> 01:52:39.405]  We have 300 plus thousand U.S.
[01:52:39.485 --> 01:52:40.365]  militia members.
[01:52:41.146 --> 01:52:42.646]  And then they say they're white supremacists.
[01:52:42.686 --> 01:52:48.927]  So they always take militia, means gun owner, the DHS reports, and they say they are white supremacists.
[01:52:48.947 --> 01:52:50.687]  So the lies stack on the lies.
[01:52:50.987 --> 01:52:54.768]  And then they're going to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans with anthrax.
[01:52:55.208 --> 01:53:00.549]  And then right on time, Obama is saying this in speeches, right as Al-Qaeda, bin Laden,
[01:53:01.249 --> 01:53:03.831]  You know, they've done the voice prints, this fake tapes pops up.
[01:53:03.851 --> 01:53:07.933]  You have the grandson of the head of the ADL, Adam Gadon, popping up agreeing.
[01:53:07.953 --> 01:53:10.454]  You know, they do this all at one time.
[01:53:10.515 --> 01:53:29.446]  And the Intel Center, publicly run by the former head of Army Black Ops and the former head of CIA Black Ops, that both work for Rumsfeld, they run the Intel Center, publicly puts out videos of Adam Gadon and Al Qaeda, American Al Qaeda, with the Intel Center logo loaded in the same video layer
[01:53:30.757 --> 01:53:34.979]  As the Al Qaeda logo, they were put on together at the same time.
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:36.440]  It's the same generation.
[01:53:38.141 --> 01:53:39.081]  Do you understand what that means?
[01:53:39.141 --> 01:53:39.922]  It's totally fake.
[01:53:41.161 --> 01:53:42.582]  And then Glenn Beck comes out.
[01:53:42.702 --> 01:53:44.643]  Let's play this clip right now, just part of it.
[01:53:45.023 --> 01:53:47.605]  He comes out and, I love America, he's always crying.
[01:53:48.585 --> 01:53:50.086]  He does this fake thing and he'll laugh at you.
[01:53:50.887 --> 01:53:52.007]  FEMA camps aren't real.
[01:53:52.087 --> 01:53:54.309]  Ron Paul supporters are terrorists, but I like Ron Paul.
[01:53:54.329 --> 01:53:56.570]  We need to use the army against American people.
[01:53:56.870 --> 01:54:01.233]  And I've talked about this on a holy alliance of Al Qaeda and the militias.
[01:54:02.537 --> 01:54:25.332]  Which is all what the DHS report says, which is all what the Feds have been saying since Oklahoma City when they had Arabs with McVeigh in that government operation, but for some reason pulled back from saying Arabs were involved, and I predicted for in the future to bring that back out and claim that Arabs and Al-Qaeda work with American gun owners to sic homeland security on the American people, which is now happening years later.
[01:54:26.453 --> 01:54:26.973]  Here's the clip.
[01:54:29.025 --> 01:54:38.452]  He goes on to suggest that Al Qaeda will work with what he claims are 300,000 American white supremacist militias who also hate the U.S.
[01:54:38.472 --> 01:54:38.872]  government.
[01:54:38.892 --> 01:54:45.797]  If you're a long-time viewer of my program, you know that I've been talking about that unholy alliance for a while.
[01:54:47.379 --> 01:54:51.722]  There is no need for airplanes, conspiracies, timings, and so on.
[01:54:53.557 --> 01:55:10.692]  One person, with the courage to carry four pounds of anthrax, will go to the White House lawn, and will spread the confetti all over them, and then we will do these cries of joy.
[01:55:13.356 --> 01:55:24.140]  This is, this is something, I mean, is this just a nonsense recruiting, or is this something that we have evidence that he really needs this and he has the ability to do this?
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:25.761]  The White House really launches the anthrax attacks.
[01:55:25.781 --> 01:55:26.982]  Look, absolutely.
[01:55:27.122 --> 01:55:28.822]  They mean to do us harm.
[01:55:28.902 --> 01:55:30.463]  This is no nonsense.
[01:55:30.543 --> 01:55:32.084]  This is an insight into alcoholism.
[01:55:32.124 --> 01:55:34.585]  Meanwhile, hit pause, I can't listen to this baloney.
[01:55:35.265 --> 01:55:44.376]  I can't listen to the Washington Times reporter that put out this exclusive Al-Qaeda eyes bio attack from Mexico and the news said the flu was Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:44.857 --> 01:55:46.879]  Al-Qaeda is a CIA program name.
[01:55:46.919 --> 01:55:48.121]  Brzezinski brags about it.
[01:55:48.561 --> 01:55:50.543]  Al-Qaeda was used to attack the Serbs, the Russians.
[01:55:51.044 --> 01:55:53.165]  They took to take the blame for attacking the U.S.
[01:55:53.485 --> 01:56:03.608]  British intelligence set up the Wahhabis and the White House admits they are using Al-Qaeda, the number three in Al-Qaeda, to attack Iran, bomb their mosque and airplanes, to bring down the Shiite government.
[01:56:03.788 --> 01:56:11.611]  But they think our media is so dumb and they think our people are so dumb, the globalists say Iran is backing Al-Qaeda when Iran is Shiite.
[01:56:12.851 --> 01:56:15.232]  And then Israel admits they founded Hezbollah
[01:56:16.516 --> 01:56:21.477]  Hamas, Israel admits they founded Hamas to counter Hezbollah, which is Shiite.
[01:56:22.037 --> 01:56:27.459]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen, the military-industrial complex has taken America over.
[01:56:27.879 --> 01:56:38.982]  It needs to have an excuse, so it's going to stage terror attacks as a pretext to put NORTHCOM on the streets of this country, and it's all designed, and NORTHCOM admits their main mission is fighting American gun owners, former veterans.
[01:56:39.542 --> 01:56:46.211]  But to do that, they gotta say, veterans and gun owners are Al-Qaeda working with the white supremacist.
[01:56:46.451 --> 01:56:49.976]  And that's the script Glenn Beck and the Washington Times are putting out.
[01:56:50.316 --> 01:56:51.178]  We told you they would.
[01:56:54.942 --> 01:56:56.064]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke.
[01:57:00.336 --> 01:57:00.696]  I think so.
[01:57:25.011 --> 01:57:25.331]  I think so.
[01:57:53.783 --> 01:57:59.087]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:57:59.607 --> 01:58:06.572]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:58:07.179 --> 01:58:13.342]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:58:13.762 --> 01:58:15.603]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:58:15.743 --> 01:58:18.144]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:58:18.244 --> 01:58:29.189]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:58:29.807 --> 01:58:31.088]  It's not about left or right.
[01:58:31.469 --> 01:58:32.870]  It's about a one world government.
[01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:39.696]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:58:40.257 --> 01:58:48.024]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:48.524 --> 01:58:49.665]  The Obama Deception.
[01:58:50.086 --> 01:58:51.267]  The people strike back.
[01:58:52.961 --> 01:58:57.284]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:58:57.485 --> 01:58:59.906]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:59:00.047 --> 01:59:09.514]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:59:09.514 --> 01:59:09.954]  We're good to go.
[01:59:28.673 --> 01:59:29.233]  Let's do it!
[01:59:54.736 --> 02:00:00.760]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:00:01.361 --> 02:00:04.403]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:07.185 --> 02:00:12.729]  Well, he is kind enough to join us from his home and historic
[02:00:14.429 --> 02:00:14.889]  New York.
[02:00:14.909 --> 02:00:17.370]  I guess they're in the Hudson Valley, you'd say.
[02:00:17.690 --> 02:00:18.531]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:00:19.331 --> 02:00:23.433]  He is the martial artist of trend forecasting.
[02:00:23.973 --> 02:00:30.216]  The purpose of trend forecasting is to provide insights and directions and anticipation of what the future may bring.
[02:00:31.576 --> 02:00:33.137]  And to be prepared for the unexpected.
[02:00:33.177 --> 02:00:41.340]  Gerald Cilente, a close combat practitioner and black belt trainer, well understands the importance of protecting rather than reacting.
[02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:44.431]  And being proactive.
[02:00:44.451 --> 02:00:47.693]  The first rule of close combat is to attack the attacker.
[02:00:49.254 --> 02:00:51.216]  Action is faster than reaction.
[02:00:51.276 --> 02:00:52.677]  The same holds true for the future.
[02:00:53.598 --> 02:00:54.839]  You know the future is coming.
[02:00:55.419 --> 02:00:56.760]  Attack it before it attacks you.
[02:00:57.321 --> 02:01:02.004]  Founder of the Trends Research Institute in 1980, Gerald Salente is a pioneer trends strategist.
[02:01:02.104 --> 02:01:06.668]  He is author of the national bestseller Trends 2000 and Trend Tracking Warner Books.
[02:01:08.189 --> 02:01:13.053]  And far better than Megatrends and publisher of the internationally circulated Trends Journal
[02:01:14.421 --> 02:01:16.282]  Newsletter and that's putting it lightly.
[02:01:16.582 --> 02:01:19.184]  He's made a lot of accurate predictions, been very accurate.
[02:01:21.545 --> 02:01:30.551]  I mean for decades and we always enjoy having Gerald Cilente up here because we understand that we need to see where the elite are going, what the globalists are setting up, what's happening in the future.
[02:01:32.733 --> 02:01:35.995]  Gerald, you and I and many others predicted GM would go bankrupt.
[02:01:36.536 --> 02:01:37.916]  They're hacking it up in pieces.
[02:01:38.922 --> 02:01:40.923]  Giving it to China, Russia, and Brazil.
[02:01:40.983 --> 02:01:43.904]  The public doesn't seem to know that even though it's in Bloomberg in the news.
[02:01:44.225 --> 02:01:54.810]  It's buried that we're paying the bailout money through World Trade Organization agreements that the bailout money can't be spent exclusively here, so large portions have to be spent internationally.
[02:01:54.850 --> 02:01:57.551]  So we're paying to have it shipped out overseas.
[02:01:58.051 --> 02:01:59.152]  Banks are collapsing.
[02:01:59.192 --> 02:02:02.294]  Real estate market you predicted a year ago on this show is
[02:02:03.354 --> 02:02:07.036]  You know, really imploding faster, and you said the big thing would be commercial real estate.
[02:02:07.076 --> 02:02:08.217]  Now that's accelerating.
[02:02:09.338 --> 02:02:12.499]  They're openly announcing youth brigades, red and black uniforms.
[02:02:12.519 --> 02:02:13.920]  We're going to play some video of that.
[02:02:14.461 --> 02:02:20.184]  We found a new bill, Burma's did earlier, as you'll be covering tonight, 9 to midnight, here on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:02:20.204 --> 02:02:24.847]  We're going to cover that with you, where they openly say again, national compulsory service.
[02:02:27.108 --> 02:02:34.033]  Even though you and I have predicted this is coming, and many others have seen, you know, the tyranny, it's still hard to believe it's actually manifesting.
[02:02:34.293 --> 02:02:35.053]  Gerald Solente.
[02:02:35.894 --> 02:02:37.215]  It is hard to believe it.
[02:02:37.395 --> 02:02:53.505]  It began really under, in full blast under Bush with his top programs, and buying out, as we did with Bear Stearns, was at $30 billion, they guaranteed that sale to, I believe it was J.P.
[02:02:53.545 --> 02:02:54.066]  Morgan,
[02:02:54.628 --> 02:03:06.139]  The takeover of Fannie and Freddie, the mortgage companies owning AIG, the world's largest insurance company, now Chrysler and GM.
[02:03:07.658 --> 02:03:17.345]  And as we know, the definition of the merger of corporate state powers is called fascism, according to Mussolini.
[02:03:17.946 --> 02:03:19.587]  And we knew a thing or two about it.
[02:03:20.307 --> 02:03:26.032]  And that's what we're seeing now, the first stages of what we're calling fascism lite.
[02:03:26.752 --> 02:03:32.516]  And you're pointing it out very well with the uniforms, the compulsory service, and
[02:03:35.516 --> 02:03:53.614]  And all of the steps that they're taking, where the government is now infringing deeper and deeper into our lives to the point where now one out of every six dollars that are being spent in this country is coming from the government.
[02:03:54.355 --> 02:04:09.020]  So it's a trend that happened really in a little over a year where America went from the world's greatest entrepreneurial country where no one was too big to save
[02:04:10.485 --> 02:04:21.457]  Or to fail, where now the rest of us are too small to save, and we're becoming servants of the major companies.
[02:04:21.997 --> 02:04:24.560]  Again, current events form future trends.
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:29.145]  We just look at the expansion plans for Walmart.
[02:04:29.645 --> 02:04:30.746]  It's very ironic.
[02:04:30.786 --> 02:04:36.110]  They used to say, as goes General Motors, or what's good for General Motors is good for America.
[02:04:36.691 --> 02:04:41.455]  And now we can say, as goes Walmart, so goes America.
[02:04:41.975 --> 02:04:47.800]  Walmart's going to create another, they're bragging about it, 22,000 jobs.
[02:04:48.901 --> 02:04:53.845]  Compare those to the jobs we used to have when this country had a manufacturing base.
[02:04:53.945 --> 02:05:07.223]  Well, Walmart, I mean, don't they on the whole food chain, they feel kind of the vulture or maggot position that sure, the vultures and maggots do well when the rest of the economy's dead, but only for a time.
[02:05:08.247 --> 02:05:11.930]  Well, that's exactly it, and the kind of jobs they produce.
[02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:21.476]  I mean, who really wants to go to college, or anywhere else, or even get a high school degree, and then be relegated to working at Walmart, you know?
[02:05:21.656 --> 02:05:26.619]  I know a lot of folks with college degrees who are working at the grocery store, or Walmart, and they're not too happy.
[02:05:26.979 --> 02:05:29.401]  That's something else you talk about, it's the college bubble, but go ahead.
[02:05:30.021 --> 02:05:42.688]  So what we're doing is, when you hear these advertisements, Alex, where Walmart brags about, you know, everyday low prices, well sure, everyday low, we're turning into a Walmart economy.
[02:05:43.188 --> 02:05:44.389]  Everyday low prices.
[02:05:44.449 --> 02:05:48.451]  With everyday low prices comes everyday low paying jobs.
[02:05:48.851 --> 02:05:52.994]  With everyday low paying jobs comes everyday low quality.
[02:05:53.454 --> 02:05:56.796]  So everyday America is sinking lower and lower.
[02:05:57.356 --> 02:06:19.451]  The GM bailout in this country, it should be... I believe that these people in Congress, from the President down, should be being brought up on criminal charges for abrogating our Constitution and becoming so involved in private industry to the levels that they've become.
[02:06:19.811 --> 02:06:24.854]  And when you read their thin defense for it, they use quotes like,
[02:06:27.196 --> 02:06:28.237]  And we hope to be.
[02:06:28.478 --> 02:06:30.280]  What do you mean you had to do this?
[02:06:30.681 --> 02:06:32.583]  Who said you had to do this?
[02:06:33.124 --> 02:06:34.767]  Certainly not the American people.
[02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:40.494]  Well notice, Gerald Cilente, that the more they do, the worse it gets for all of us, but the better for them.
[02:06:40.514 --> 02:06:43.819]  And this is my question for you, and then finish the point we're making.
[02:06:44.756 --> 02:06:56.058]  Is that we have the IMF and World Bank bragging about imploding third world nations by design, buying off their governments, destroying confidence in the supposed recovery, then consolidating even more.
[02:06:56.718 --> 02:07:03.260]  The big government system, the big central banks offshore, George Soros saying he's having a great crisis, culmination of his life.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:11.961]  They're bragging that they love that everything's falling apart because then they are flush with all the fiat currency and credit they create out of nothing.
[02:07:12.262 --> 02:07:13.922]  They get to buy up all the real assets.
[02:07:14.775 --> 02:07:18.358]  They get to pose as the saviors of the crisis they created.
[02:07:18.378 --> 02:07:22.861]  They're openly announcing a new Bank of the World will pay our carbon taxes, too.
[02:07:22.881 --> 02:07:28.645]  They're telling us the new recovery is lower quality, less jobs, less freedom, less mobility.
[02:07:29.126 --> 02:07:32.949]  So they're advertising bondage and chains as the recovery.
[02:07:32.969 --> 02:07:36.471]  I mean, these people are crazy like a fox.
[02:07:36.511 --> 02:07:37.092]  Or do you disagree?
[02:07:38.046 --> 02:07:52.038]  Well, you know, to some extent, yes and no, in the sense that I think they're crazy like a fox in that the objective is to take control of our lives, and they're doing it in every way possible.
[02:07:52.720 --> 02:08:01.223]  And they use these crises, not that they're so much as manufactured, but they exploit them for everything that they're worth.
[02:08:01.863 --> 02:08:09.286]  And as Rahm Emanuel had noted, that, you know, you never let a good crisis, you know, be squandered.
[02:08:09.886 --> 02:08:12.367]  And that's what they're really doing as we see it.
[02:08:12.727 --> 02:08:20.770]  The second thing, Alex, is in building on what you said, one of our forecasts, as you know, we're calling for the bailout bubble.
[02:08:21.667 --> 02:08:24.290]  And just briefly, we had first the dot-com bubble.
[02:08:24.370 --> 02:08:25.271]  I've got to stop you.
[02:08:25.491 --> 02:08:29.535]  You said that first, I remember, like a year ago or nine, ten months ago.
[02:08:29.896 --> 02:08:33.259]  Now they're calling it bailout bubble on the news without giving you credit.
[02:08:33.299 --> 02:08:33.840]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:35.542]  Well, that happens a lot, doesn't it?
[02:08:36.403 --> 02:08:37.323]  Yeah.
[02:08:37.784 --> 02:08:44.411]  So, now the bailout first that we had, well, not first, but the most recent, was the dot-com bubble.
[02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:49.191]  The dot-com bubble burst, $5 trillion is lost in the markets.
[02:08:49.751 --> 02:08:55.233]  Rather than let their too-big-to-fail friends lose big money, they created the other bubble.
[02:08:55.733 --> 02:09:00.635]  They lowered interest rates to 46-year lows, flooded the marketplace with cheap money.
[02:09:00.755 --> 02:09:04.657]  Again, every time they do that, they devalue our standard of living.
[02:09:05.137 --> 02:09:06.998]  But they created the real estate bubble.
[02:09:07.318 --> 02:09:09.038]  Go out and borrow on your house.
[02:09:09.118 --> 02:09:09.999]  It's a piggy bank.
[02:09:10.339 --> 02:09:11.659]  Want to build that new addition?
[02:09:11.699 --> 02:09:12.639]  Go on a vacation?
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:13.900]  Buy a new car?
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:15.080]  It's cheap.
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:16.241]  Just go do it.
[02:09:16.601 --> 02:09:18.201]  They created the next bubble.
[02:09:18.241 --> 02:09:19.281]  That bubble burst.
[02:09:19.382 --> 02:09:21.882]  And, of course, they love to blame the little people.
[02:09:22.242 --> 02:09:23.723]  Not talking about everything.
[02:09:23.783 --> 02:09:26.824]  Leveraged buyout firms like Carlisle.
[02:09:27.544 --> 02:09:36.327]  And Blackstone and Cerebus, on and on, who bought companies for virtually no money down worth tens of billions of dollars.
[02:09:36.747 --> 02:09:39.288]  That was where the real credit crisis happened, by the way.
[02:09:39.348 --> 02:09:53.212]  And by the way, before I forget, let me bring this up, I'm sure you've seen all the news where they do stress tests on healthy banks and the government says, no, you haven't done well, so the bank plunges, and then the government basically hands it over to Carlisle.
[02:09:53.632 --> 02:09:55.093]  I mean, this is just piracy.
[02:09:55.513 --> 02:09:58.094]  Well, again, look who's involved with Carlisle.
[02:09:58.475 --> 02:10:00.536]  Look at the members of the Carlisle Group.
[02:10:00.976 --> 02:10:06.359]  You know, they're, they're, it's, it's, it's the Bush, it's, it's the Bush wing of the Mafia.
[02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:09.940]  You know, so as we look at the players, you know where the money goes.
[02:10:10.020 --> 02:10:10.801]  Follow the money.
[02:10:11.241 --> 02:10:13.162]  So now we have the bailout bubble.
[02:10:13.802 --> 02:10:22.647]  And this really, what we're talking about now is that, and building on what you said, now when this bubble bursts, and it's going to burst,
[02:10:23.422 --> 02:10:26.764]  When this one bursts, there's no way to re-inflate another bubble.
[02:10:26.784 --> 02:10:31.606]  This is the mega-bubble, this is the fa-complete, the coup de grace, this is the final bubble.
[02:10:31.766 --> 02:10:46.253]  The final bubble because now what's happened is, unlike those other bubbles, our economic superstructure has been changed because now government has printed phantom money out of thin air,
[02:10:47.156 --> 02:11:00.387]  Based on nothing, producing practically nothing, has taken equity positions in private enterprise with executive control and management powers over these corporations.
[02:11:00.808 --> 02:11:05.071]  So now when this breaks, there's nothing left to refill it.
[02:11:05.632 --> 02:11:08.354]  And here's the next step.
[02:11:08.934 --> 02:11:13.178]  With each failure, they create an even bigger failure.
[02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:15.320]  We are concerned
[02:11:15.925 --> 02:11:23.074]  That after this bubble breaks, the next crisis they create will be taking us to war.
[02:11:23.554 --> 02:11:24.916]  They do it all the time.
[02:11:27.859 --> 02:11:29.240]  Stay there, Gerald Cilente.
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:30.601]  Break that down, we'll get back.
[02:11:30.661 --> 02:11:34.543]  And by the way, what he's saying mirrors what Paul Watson wrote about six months ago.
[02:11:34.983 --> 02:11:46.350]  The Rand Corporation, this is big news in Europe, not on the news here, said we need a World War II size global crisis to be able to get us out of this.
[02:11:47.369 --> 02:11:48.329]  And they call it a bubble.
[02:11:49.010 --> 02:11:53.751]  So, uh, they're certainly doing some trends forecasting over at RAND in a very wicked way.
[02:11:53.771 --> 02:11:56.652]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:11:56.812 --> 02:12:02.054]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:12:02.334 --> 02:12:06.115]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients.
[02:12:06.515 --> 02:12:07.695]  Most of which are synthetic.
[02:12:08.055 --> 02:12:09.176]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:12:09.536 --> 02:12:18.578]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:12:18.858 --> 02:12:20.478]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[02:12:20.678 --> 02:12:24.859]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[02:12:24.899 --> 02:12:29.520]  They're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:33.361]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[02:12:33.761 --> 02:12:34.502]  Keep it natural.
[02:12:34.842 --> 02:12:38.444]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091.

[02:12:48.811 --> 02:12:51.873]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.
[02:12:51.893 --> 02:12:54.454]  800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:12:54.514 --> 02:12:55.695]  And let's take in a brief mind mover.
[02:13:02.639 --> 02:13:08.102]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[02:13:08.302 --> 02:13:13.904]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[02:13:14.104 --> 02:13:15.765]  The stimulus package is working.
[02:13:16.105 --> 02:13:17.646]  A bailout is coming your way.
[02:13:17.986 --> 02:13:21.908]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[02:13:22.188 --> 02:13:22.568]  Pardon me?
[02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:24.289]  Back to the real world.
[02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:28.531]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[02:13:28.851 --> 02:13:30.812]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[02:13:31.385 --> 02:13:32.866]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[02:13:33.106 --> 02:13:43.890]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:51.653]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[02:13:54.114 --> 02:13:59.356]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:14:00.146 --> 02:14:05.490]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:14:06.010 --> 02:14:12.214]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:14:12.534 --> 02:14:14.335]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:14:14.495 --> 02:14:16.877]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:14:16.957 --> 02:14:27.844]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:14:30.129 --> 02:14:31.390]  It's not about left or right.
[02:14:31.810 --> 02:14:33.190]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:14:33.650 --> 02:14:39.993]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:14:40.573 --> 02:14:48.356]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:14:48.836 --> 02:14:49.976]  The Obama Deception.
[02:14:50.396 --> 02:14:51.597]  The people strike back.
[02:14:59.617 --> 02:15:10.639]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[02:15:11.359 --> 02:15:13.899]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:20.641]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[02:15:21.281 --> 02:15:28.262]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[02:15:28.857 --> 02:15:32.039]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[02:15:32.739 --> 02:15:36.081]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[02:15:36.621 --> 02:15:41.303]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[02:15:41.784 --> 02:15:44.945]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[02:16:17.608 --> 02:16:18.689]  This is real, folks.
[02:16:19.129 --> 02:16:21.390]  We have criminals in control of our nation, robbing us.
[02:16:24.332 --> 02:16:29.095]  They are so ruthless and so cunning that they know it's going to cause rioting and revolution.
[02:16:29.135 --> 02:16:29.595]  They don't care.
[02:16:29.635 --> 02:16:31.477]  They're all buying duchies offshore.
[02:16:32.217 --> 02:16:34.158]  And by the way, I know quite a few billionaires.
[02:16:34.438 --> 02:16:35.619]  They evacuated years ago.
[02:16:38.181 --> 02:16:39.482]  They know what Gerald Solente knows.
[02:16:39.522 --> 02:16:40.322]  They know what we know.
[02:16:43.364 --> 02:16:44.865]  This is the court of the Crimson King.
[02:16:46.374 --> 02:16:48.816]  By the time this is done, a lot of blood's gonna flow on the streets.
[02:16:49.777 --> 02:16:52.659]  And I'm not looking forward to it.
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:17:02.627]  And all you foolish, petty tyrants that serve the system, I really feel sorry for you, because California's already going bankrupt, as Gerald predicted on the show eight, nine months ago.
[02:17:04.191 --> 02:17:09.715]  Gerald Solente, we're getting into the new mega-bubble, a cascade of failures, starting a war.
[02:17:09.755 --> 02:17:15.538]  Let's get into that, because as bad as this news is, it's better to know it's coming.
[02:17:15.558 --> 02:17:24.123]  I mean, if I lived in a valley and somebody called me and said, the dam just broke, you'll be in 20 feet of water in 10 minutes, get out of there, I'd be, I would thank them that I could get to high ground.
[02:17:24.343 --> 02:17:30.007]  We get bitched at, because the delusional public thinks, some of them, that, oh, well just be positive,
[02:17:30.728 --> 02:17:33.715]  And if we just make up it's okay, it'll be okay.
[02:17:33.895 --> 02:17:37.683]  They'd rather not be warned that the dam just broke upstream, Gerald.
[02:17:38.616 --> 02:17:39.317]  Well, that's it.
[02:17:39.397 --> 02:17:42.179]  I mean, people are living on illusion.
[02:17:42.239 --> 02:17:43.900]  They don't want to face the reality.
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:50.906]  And, of course, this is a Disney World, and people do live in it.
[02:17:51.427 --> 02:17:53.348]  Well, we're talking about the war, Alex.
[02:17:53.408 --> 02:17:56.931]  Of course, you know, we're not saying that this is going to happen.
[02:17:56.971 --> 02:18:02.916]  We're saying it's likely to happen, considering the trends that are taking place.
[02:18:02.956 --> 02:18:04.097]  They're adding up to it.
[02:18:04.717 --> 02:18:09.019]  Each time, again, that's why we're talking about one bubble after the next.
[02:18:09.579 --> 02:18:22.285]  With each bubble, they reinflate it to a bigger bubble, to yet a bigger bubble, and then when there's nothing else left to do, they become emboldened by their failures, and they take you to war.
[02:18:22.325 --> 02:18:26.267]  You go throughout history, and this is historical.
[02:18:26.627 --> 02:18:28.508]  They do it all the time.
[02:18:29.028 --> 02:18:31.149]  They can no longer cover up their failures.
[02:18:31.209 --> 02:18:32.810]  Well, that's what RAND Corporation says.
[02:18:32.850 --> 02:18:36.673]  They say, World War II got us out of the depression, we need something that big.
[02:18:36.693 --> 02:18:41.076]  And they look at Korea, they look at Iran, they discuss, where should we start a war?
[02:18:41.836 --> 02:18:42.576]  My God!
[02:18:42.597 --> 02:18:52.283]  It looks like at this moment, and from listening to President Obama, he's putting a lot of focus on Pakistan.
[02:18:52.907 --> 02:18:53.147]  Yeah.
[02:18:53.608 --> 02:19:18.087]  And we're seeing what's happening there as the war is being prosecuted, and of course there, you know, and it escalated the Afghan war, put in a new commander, McChrystal, and it's spreading into Afghan, and there's a crisis going on over there now in the Swat Valley, over a million people who have been, homes have been, they're displaced!
[02:19:18.727 --> 02:19:22.850]  And so what happens is, this is a very logical progression.
[02:19:23.350 --> 02:19:31.296]  The more people you kill in foreign countries, the more they hate you, and the more they're going to want to retaliate.
[02:19:31.916 --> 02:19:47.427]  So what we're forecasting is there's going to be a retaliatory strike against the United States coming out of the Middle East as a result of our escalation of wars in those areas,
[02:19:48.167 --> 02:20:01.957]  What will happen is they'll call it terrorism, rather than getting it even, and they'll blame it on people that hate our liberty and freedoms, and they'll escalate it into something bigger.
[02:20:02.318 --> 02:20:10.624]  It's an old story, and it will be repeated, just the players will change, the lines will be almost the same.
[02:20:11.044 --> 02:20:21.027]  So we're talking about encirclement of Russia, Pakistan, India, Kashmir, with Pakistan and Afghanistan escalating, North Korea out of control.
[02:20:21.307 --> 02:20:33.412]  You can just see all the fires all over that crescent there from Eastern Europe all the way into Southeast Asia.
[02:20:33.712 --> 02:20:35.872]  I mean this is just horrifying.
[02:20:35.912 --> 02:20:37.433]  What's your timeline on this?
[02:20:37.967 --> 02:20:51.442]  Well, again, it's very difficult to put a timeline on these, because, for example, we had predicted that the crash of 2009 would have taken place already.
[02:20:51.843 --> 02:20:56.047]  We believed it would have happened in March, and it was right on schedule to do so.
[02:20:56.107 --> 02:20:57.509]  The market hit a low on March 9th.
[02:20:58.962 --> 02:21:01.605]  But they come up with schemes undreamed of.
[02:21:02.085 --> 02:21:13.496]  Who would have thought, for example, as you pointed out, that so much has changed with this country, where now we own General Motors, with 60% owners of this company?
[02:21:13.856 --> 02:21:18.140]  Who would have dreamed that they would be pumping $12.8 trillion into the system?
[02:21:20.896 --> 02:21:21.516]  Unbelievable.
[02:21:21.556 --> 02:21:24.798]  Gerald Cilente, stay there, quick break, long segment coming up.
[02:21:25.459 --> 02:21:30.602]  And we'll give out his website as well for everybody that wants to check it out, so get a pen and paper ready.
[02:21:31.002 --> 02:21:32.543]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:33.123 --> 02:21:37.086]  I am Alex Jones, and again, we have 30 minutes left in this transmission.
[02:21:37.586 --> 02:21:38.086]  Stay with us.
[02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:44.650]  We're on the march.
[02:21:45.111 --> 02:21:46.732]  The empire's on the run.
[02:21:47.652 --> 02:21:50.354]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:58.822]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[02:21:59.143 --> 02:22:00.303]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:22:00.443 --> 02:22:04.385]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:06.271]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:22:06.571 --> 02:22:12.873]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:22:13.633 --> 02:22:16.574]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[02:22:16.894 --> 02:22:18.374]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[02:22:18.635 --> 02:22:23.076]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[02:22:23.356 --> 02:22:25.917]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:22:26.157 --> 02:22:32.039]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[02:22:32.419 --> 02:22:34.601]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:22:34.821 --> 02:22:37.083]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[02:22:37.303 --> 02:22:39.065]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[02:22:39.385 --> 02:22:44.869]  Go to www.enerfood.com.
[02:22:45.090 --> 02:22:49.553]  That's www.enerfood.com.
[02:22:49.734 --> 02:22:52.656]  Or just click on their banner on infowars.com for special pricing.
[02:22:53.971 --> 02:22:58.975]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:22:59.195 --> 02:23:02.978]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:23:03.218 --> 02:23:08.822]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:23:09.122 --> 02:23:09.562]  It's true.
[02:23:09.763 --> 02:23:13.966]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:23:14.186 --> 02:23:20.550]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:23:20.731 --> 02:23:21.171]  Number four,
[02:23:21.391 --> 02:23:24.035]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:23:24.296 --> 02:23:27.561]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:23:27.581 --> 02:23:31.687]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[02:23:36.775 --> 02:23:37.035]  We're good.
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:55.200]  Spring is here.
[02:23:55.461 --> 02:23:56.241]  Growing season.
[02:23:56.421 --> 02:23:58.403]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:23:58.623 --> 02:24:00.024]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:24:00.344 --> 02:24:01.004]  Think about it.
[02:24:01.304 --> 02:24:05.167]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:24:05.407 --> 02:24:08.869]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:24:09.089 --> 02:24:11.651]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:24:11.931 --> 02:24:23.779]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:24:23.999 --> 02:24:24.539]  I think so.
[02:24:54.707 --> 02:24:59.711]  We're going to have Gerald Cilente back up in the next month or so.
[02:24:59.751 --> 02:25:00.672]  He's very busy.
[02:25:20.097 --> 02:25:21.938]  Discuss ways to get out of this.
[02:25:21.978 --> 02:25:26.200]  The problem is the establishment isn't listening and doesn't care, so how do solutions even matter?
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:31.863]  Well, I guess once we overthrow this system, the danger will be that some new tyranny will be brought in, as Ron Paul has said.
[02:25:32.944 --> 02:25:35.865]  It's very rare to have a revolution that doesn't turn into something as bad or worse.
[02:25:36.446 --> 02:25:40.368]  That's why I'm not all rah-rah revolution unless it's what the founders did.
[02:25:41.271 --> 02:25:42.712]  It's so special what this country did.
[02:25:42.752 --> 02:25:45.515]  I want to talk some with Gerald before he leaves us about that.
[02:25:46.296 --> 02:25:50.039]  But before we do that, I want to tell you about a sponsor that's made this hour possible.
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:51.761]  SurvivalSeaBank.com.
[02:25:52.542 --> 02:25:55.325]  Folks, these are just great folks, the people from Solutions Science.
[02:25:57.106 --> 02:25:59.829]  And they have the Survival Seed Bank.
[02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:05.173]  Great prices, high quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid seeds.
[02:26:05.653 --> 02:26:07.455]  These are heirloom.
[02:26:07.475 --> 02:26:07.915]  877-327-0365.
[02:26:08.195 --> 02:26:09.417]  Plus, gardens are fun.
[02:26:09.437 --> 02:26:11.538]  I mean, I've got a garden no matter where I live.
[02:26:11.578 --> 02:26:14.461]  I have a little bitty backyard and I've got a garden with tomatoes and stuff growing.
[02:26:15.101 --> 02:26:16.742]  And, you know, my aunt and uncle got a huge garden.
[02:26:16.762 --> 02:26:17.863]  My parents have a big garden.
[02:26:17.923 --> 02:26:18.944]  It's just wonderful.
[02:26:18.984 --> 02:26:19.684]  Your kids love it.
[02:26:20.225 --> 02:26:21.786]  Get high-quality seeds.
[02:26:21.846 --> 02:26:39.899]  The big seed companies, Monsanto and others, are buying these companies all up on record, building big secret seed vaults that have been in the news so they're not too secret, trying to get a control over agriculture, trying to create a monopoly, trying to shut down the farms and ranches with the National Animal ID and National Premise Society.
[02:26:39.939 --> 02:26:41.900]  They're raiding Amish that are selling
[02:26:43.001 --> 02:26:43.302]  We're good.
[02:27:02.523 --> 02:27:02.683]  I think?
[02:27:24.112 --> 02:27:33.675]  You know, your home and basic information or use a mock home example and they tell you the cheapest, easiest upgrades to do that will increase your home's value.
[02:27:33.915 --> 02:27:38.317]  The best for resale and they've also got stuff for buyers.
[02:27:38.757 --> 02:27:42.238]  So it's all there at H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[02:27:42.498 --> 02:27:47.479]  Homegain.com or just check out Mac's little orange gorilla on InfoWars.com.
[02:27:47.519 --> 02:27:49.100]  That's their mascot and that is the
[02:27:51.311 --> 02:27:52.692]  Mascot for HomeGain.com.
[02:27:52.952 --> 02:27:54.453]  Going back to Gerald Cilente.
[02:27:54.774 --> 02:28:03.420]  Gerald, tell folks about your website and how they can subscribe to get your Great Trends forecast journal.
[02:28:05.091 --> 02:28:07.512]  It's TrendsResearch.com.
[02:28:07.552 --> 02:28:09.533]  That's TrendsResearch.com.
[02:28:09.913 --> 02:28:14.275]  And what we encourage them to do is to look at our past trends journals.
[02:28:14.335 --> 02:28:20.878]  For example, we have the top trends of 2008 that they could look at, the whole journal.
[02:28:21.418 --> 02:28:23.239]  And they could judge for themselves.
[02:28:23.299 --> 02:28:27.341]  The motto, of course, of the Trends Research Institute is, Think for Yourself.
[02:28:27.901 --> 02:28:32.943]  And so they could see what we have forecast, what has come true, and what's going to happen.
[02:28:32.983 --> 02:28:34.544]  And much of what we've written
[02:28:35.104 --> 02:28:37.066]  It's in the headlines news today.
[02:28:37.086 --> 02:28:48.333]  And about the things to do, by the way, in survival, I'm a strong believer, and I do it myself, is I buy gold.
[02:28:49.034 --> 02:28:52.616]  And we are forecasting gold 2000 an ounce.
[02:28:53.237 --> 02:28:56.339]  And you can see, again, current events form future trends.
[02:28:56.972 --> 02:29:07.760]  We can see they just sent Timothy Geithner, our Treasury Secretary, over to China to try to sue them, sue out the deal, because the world is starting to unload dollars.
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:12.063]  You can see, for example, again, current events form future trends.
[02:29:12.583 --> 02:29:18.468]  Gold is now moving back toward the $1,000 an ounce mark, crept up very quickly.
[02:29:18.868 --> 02:29:22.971]  The dollar is again losing against the key basket of currencies.
[02:29:23.511 --> 02:29:26.334]  Several months ago it was 124 to a euro.
[02:29:26.755 --> 02:29:27.615]  Now it's about 142.
[02:29:27.916 --> 02:29:42.271]  So the world knows that you cannot print phantom money out of thin air based on nothing and producing practically nothing without destroying the economy.
[02:29:42.431 --> 02:29:43.332]  Well, Gerald, interrupt.
[02:29:43.432 --> 02:29:43.932]  I saw a
[02:29:46.305 --> 02:29:47.326]  A bunch of news articles.
[02:29:47.366 --> 02:29:48.687]  I forgot to cover them the last few days.
[02:29:48.747 --> 02:29:50.128]  In fact, guys, Google this for me.
[02:29:50.789 --> 02:29:54.912]  Top insurance company buys gold for the first time in history.
[02:29:54.932 --> 02:29:57.435]  $400 million they bought.
[02:29:57.615 --> 02:29:59.136]  Tell folks about that, Mr. Cilenti.
[02:29:59.196 --> 02:30:00.077]  I believe it was Northwest Mutual.
[02:30:00.097 --> 02:30:03.260]  They had $400 to $200 million worth of gold they bought for the first time in business.
[02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:04.921]  I think they were in business like 150 years.
[02:30:13.228 --> 02:30:24.616]  Yeah, that's what it said, and then I did more searches and found out a bunch of governments, like the Chinese, the Arabs, the Europeans, and other insurance companies are quietly moving into gold.
[02:30:24.676 --> 02:30:25.716]  They've never done that.
[02:30:26.037 --> 02:30:27.698]  What does that tell you, Gerald Cilente?
[02:30:28.194 --> 02:30:35.360]  It tells us that the fiat currencies, particularly the dollar, are not going to be worth the paper they're printed on.
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:49.070]  Again, even when you hear Treasury Secretary, excuse me, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke yesterday warning that there's a risk of another crisis on the horizon.
[02:30:49.210 --> 02:30:49.771]  Inflation.
[02:30:50.071 --> 02:30:54.194]  And they're not going to be able to print more money to bail us out.
[02:30:54.474 --> 02:30:56.316]  They're running out of games.
[02:30:57.016 --> 02:31:02.581]  So, the timeline, by the way, Alex, during the summer things usually quiet down.
[02:31:02.721 --> 02:31:04.462]  Yeah, Europe goes on vacation.
[02:31:05.083 --> 02:31:08.946]  Things start getting real again around September, October.
[02:31:09.366 --> 02:31:11.048]  Again, you just look through history.
[02:31:11.388 --> 02:31:17.253]  When we saw the crisis that happened in 2008, it happened in September, I think it was September 15th.
[02:31:19.234 --> 02:31:30.816]  It was with Lehman Brothers went belly up, the biggest bankruptcy in our history, AIG crisis, Merrill Lynch, and one after another.
[02:31:30.836 --> 02:31:36.257]  What happens is when people come back from vacations, they start looking at the books in a lot of different ways.
[02:31:36.317 --> 02:31:37.357]  They get real about it.
[02:31:37.778 --> 02:31:41.738]  So, September-October is one time to look.
[02:31:42.058 --> 02:31:45.699]  The other one, and this is the one that's going to tell the final story.
[02:31:46.357 --> 02:31:47.701]  It's gonna be Christmas sales 2009.
[02:31:50.214 --> 02:31:51.895]  Watch how those sales come in.
[02:31:52.415 --> 02:31:59.419]  You're going to see them in way, way worse than they were last year, and they were terrible last year.
[02:31:59.959 --> 02:32:08.043]  Then, you move into the new year, and that's when things in 2010 really start to unravel.
[02:32:08.083 --> 02:32:09.704]  That's our timeline.
[02:32:10.304 --> 02:32:17.948]  And you're saying the only rabbit in the hat they've got that you see for another bubble, this is the end of the bubbles, unless they start a huge war?
[02:32:18.626 --> 02:32:26.770]  Yeah, but this time it's different than the times before, in the sense that this time we'll have wars of weapons of mass destruction.
[02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:35.454]  It's not going to be giant fleets fighting each other in the Pacific, or tanks, you know, coming at each other over the battlefields.
[02:32:36.074 --> 02:32:39.975]  This will be suitcase-sized nuclear weapons.
[02:32:40.515 --> 02:32:57.399]  Matter of fact, my book, Trends 2000, which came out in December of 1996, the whole front of it was front-loaded with the breakup of the former Soviet Union and all of the nuclear materials on the black market that was spread throughout the world.
[02:32:57.780 --> 02:32:59.080]  And they're still out there.
[02:32:59.700 --> 02:33:02.182]  So we're going to see a very different war.
[02:33:02.202 --> 02:33:05.544]  This will be out of control.
[02:33:06.084 --> 02:33:07.765]  No one will know what to do.
[02:33:08.205 --> 02:33:14.609]  And the chaos will be beyond what any Hollywood movie could ever dream up.
[02:33:14.969 --> 02:33:17.751]  So you're talking about a black ops, special ops war?
[02:33:18.519 --> 02:33:18.819]  Yes.
[02:33:19.700 --> 02:33:23.781]  Again, you know, anybody can get over into anybody's country.
[02:33:24.142 --> 02:33:25.482]  It's not a big deal.
[02:33:25.502 --> 02:33:27.603]  Borders are very porous.
[02:33:28.123 --> 02:33:39.228]  I remember writing in the Trends Journal, I believe it was 1998, about over a hundred suitcase-sized nuclear weapons were lost in Russia.
[02:33:39.248 --> 02:33:40.369]  I mean, lost?
[02:33:41.112 --> 02:33:43.534]  You know, so it's going to be that kind of thing.
[02:33:43.634 --> 02:33:45.435]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[02:33:45.855 --> 02:33:46.956]  We called it WWMD3.
[02:33:46.996 --> 02:33:50.739]  World Wars of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
[02:33:50.819 --> 02:33:54.942]  Okay, I want to go over that with you because you know, you've talked about it, government sponsored terror.
[02:33:55.222 --> 02:33:57.143]  There's certainly some real terror and real wars.
[02:33:58.584 --> 02:33:59.644]  You know, between powers.
[02:34:00.245 --> 02:34:01.645]  But look at these global banks.
[02:34:01.725 --> 02:34:02.925]  They're bringing in their world government.
[02:34:02.945 --> 02:34:06.007]  They're using the global crisis to get their global carbon tax.
[02:34:06.047 --> 02:34:09.508]  They engineered the crisis, whether by design or by their idiocy.
[02:34:09.868 --> 02:34:12.729]  The point is, they're clearly getting power and control out of it.
[02:34:13.209 --> 02:34:18.071]  Now they need to have a world government come into place out of this bigger crisis.
[02:34:18.431 --> 02:34:23.552]  They need to have a war, just like they used World War I to get League of Nations, World War II to get UN.
[02:34:23.853 --> 02:34:27.894]  Now they say we need one more big war to bring in the final world government.
[02:34:28.354 --> 02:34:44.898]  I see all the evidence that this is planned out, and if suitcase nukes aren't brought in, if somebody isn't stupid enough to attack, then I see them staging it because it's the only bubble, the only crisis that they have left to bring them into power.
[02:34:44.958 --> 02:34:57.641]  So I agree with what you say, Gerald, and I see them making the preparations, hardening government facilities, preparing tattletale squads, domestic infrastructure, DHS reports that Americans are terrorists, youth brigades,
[02:34:57.981 --> 02:35:01.822]  I see huge industrial buildup for war against the people.
[02:35:02.122 --> 02:35:03.562]  Northcom making announcements.
[02:35:04.382 --> 02:35:05.443]  You said this a year ago.
[02:35:05.503 --> 02:35:06.823]  We've been talking about it for a long time.
[02:35:06.863 --> 02:35:09.904]  Zoellick warns stimulus sugar high won't stem unemployment.
[02:35:09.924 --> 02:35:19.966]  What you just said, with Bernanke saying the money has to end because they've already bought everything up, he says unemployment increases that will cause political combustible issue.
[02:35:20.966 --> 02:35:23.708]  ...and destabilization and conflict.
[02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:28.290]  He says, rising joblessness threatens to set off political unrest across the globe.
[02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:36.013]  So they're saying this, but like beaters beating the bushes to drive out, you know, the mastodons over the cliff.
[02:35:36.114 --> 02:35:37.174]  We're the mastodons.
[02:35:37.894 --> 02:35:42.256]  This is all crazy like a fox going right towards their world government.
[02:35:42.697 --> 02:35:45.178]  So, Gerald Cilente, your take on that?
[02:35:45.731 --> 02:35:54.674]  Well, whether they cause it or exploit it, it's going to happen in the sense that you also have worldwide unrest.
[02:35:54.994 --> 02:35:55.715]  Latvia.
[02:35:56.115 --> 02:35:57.435]  We saw it in Greece.
[02:35:57.775 --> 02:35:58.296]  Iceland.
[02:35:58.676 --> 02:36:00.176]  You're seeing it in France.
[02:36:00.877 --> 02:36:02.877]  Look what's happening over in Spain.
[02:36:03.197 --> 02:36:04.738]  The unemployment rate is almost 20%.
[02:36:04.778 --> 02:36:05.138]  Ireland.
[02:36:07.779 --> 02:36:23.935]  The UK, and in the US, you're going to start seeing it happening, whether or not, and then again as I said, they are fermenting war in the Middle East with the escalation in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.
[02:36:24.255 --> 02:36:25.816]  So that's clearly a false flag.
[02:36:25.896 --> 02:36:29.558]  I mean, clearly there, they know they're stirring the pot on purpose.
[02:36:29.738 --> 02:36:30.398]  Exactly.
[02:36:30.518 --> 02:36:40.483]  So whether or not they create the terror, or the terror is created from their actions, one way or another, they're setting the stage for it.
[02:36:40.603 --> 02:36:49.128]  So what we're saying at this point is that the escalation of the Afghan-Pakistan wars are setting the stage
[02:36:49.648 --> 02:36:57.752]  For terrorism at 9-11 levels, again, whether manufactured or real, we're going to see it.
[02:36:58.112 --> 02:37:05.375]  And the people, look, you look at the poll data now, most people are in favor of these wars in the United States.
[02:37:05.916 --> 02:37:15.380]  So if they say, you know, we're being attacked by Islamo-fascists because they hate our liberty and freedom, the people are going to swallow it again.
[02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:22.750]  Gerald Solente, Friends Forecaster, what did you think about, or did you see, the Pakistan President?
[02:37:22.831 --> 02:37:24.193]  They're saying, why are you helping terrorists?
[02:37:24.213 --> 02:37:28.239]  And he goes, Al-Qaeda, Taliban, was created by the U.S.
[02:37:28.279 --> 02:37:30.323]  against the Russians and pushed.
[02:37:31.814 --> 02:37:35.415]  You guys are using them to destabilize us, which is what's really going on.
[02:37:37.255 --> 02:37:42.877]  They don't control all the groups, but they nudge them and fund them and stir them up.
[02:37:42.917 --> 02:37:46.358]  He made that point, and the person interviewing him on NBC kind of shut up.
[02:37:47.978 --> 02:37:51.199]  It seems like this trick is starting to wear a bit thin.
[02:37:51.809 --> 02:37:52.550]  Precisely.
[02:37:52.650 --> 02:38:07.185]  As a matter of fact, in this next Trends Journal summer edition that'll be coming out in a few weeks, we're reviewing the history of Pakistan, which we had written about when they assassinated Benazir Bhutto in January, I believe it was December 2007.
[02:38:09.233 --> 02:38:14.914]  And now her husband, Zardari, is the President of Pakistan.
[02:38:14.954 --> 02:38:16.654]  Well, they used to call him Mr. 10%.
[02:38:16.794 --> 02:38:22.135]  Because he used to take 10% of all of the government action.
[02:38:22.495 --> 02:38:28.357]  He did time in jail for being accused of raping the government for $5 billion.
[02:38:28.717 --> 02:38:31.637]  I mean, it's one criminal enterprise after another.
[02:38:32.677 --> 02:38:33.878]  And we're in the thick of it.
[02:38:34.758 --> 02:38:35.458]  Absolutely.
[02:38:37.059 --> 02:38:47.925]  Gerald Solente, I don't know if you've seen this yet, it just came out last night, Washington Times, playing some one of millions, you know, crazy Imams, bragging about it.
[02:38:47.965 --> 02:38:51.127]  We had one fighter to bring anthrax to America and kill hundreds of thousands.
[02:38:51.928 --> 02:38:52.968]  I've seen this months ago.
[02:38:53.028 --> 02:38:59.973]  They take this like it's breaking news and say he works with the gun-owning militia, then they tie militia to white supremacists.
[02:39:00.393 --> 02:39:05.036]  Same thing that they do in the DHS report that says gun owners, veterans, are the number one threat.
[02:39:05.936 --> 02:39:16.863]  And we see all of Homeland Security Northcom being set up to suppress a legitimate revolution by the American people, or a restoration, which you've been predicting.
[02:39:17.543 --> 02:39:20.125]  We've got Zoellick at the World Bank saying this is coming.
[02:39:20.445 --> 02:39:29.591]  They're clearly now swinging around the Homeland Security system, the apparatus, to point it at the American people, saying, we are Al-Qaeda.
[02:39:30.251 --> 02:39:32.853]  So they clearly know they're about to do some things politically.
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:35.902]  Well again, if there's an attack of any kind, whether it's a
[02:39:56.866 --> 02:39:59.127]  You know, manufactured or legitimate.
[02:39:59.527 --> 02:40:08.971]  The people respond very quickly by fear, as we saw with Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[02:40:09.311 --> 02:40:11.392]  They'll swallow most of what's said to them.
[02:40:11.412 --> 02:40:13.492]  But now they're going to say the gun owners are the terrorists.
[02:40:13.513 --> 02:40:17.674]  They're going to say, oh, Al-Qaeda hit us, take the people's guns, the gun owners are Al-Qaeda.
[02:40:17.874 --> 02:40:19.515]  I mean, that is really over the top.
[02:40:19.795 --> 02:40:24.837]  We don't believe, by the way, that Second Amendment rights will be repealed.
[02:40:25.530 --> 02:40:29.794]  I mean, that's our... I'm a strong advocate of Second Amendment rights.
[02:40:30.134 --> 02:40:30.295]  Why?
[02:40:30.315 --> 02:40:31.336]  Because they can't get away with it?
[02:40:31.736 --> 02:40:32.096]  They can't.
[02:40:32.116 --> 02:40:33.678]  They will not be able to get away with it.
[02:40:33.698 --> 02:40:38.322]  No matter how hard they try, you're going to have states that are going to be more stringent than others.
[02:40:38.822 --> 02:40:41.024]  But overall, they're not going to be able to stop it.
[02:40:41.285 --> 02:40:44.448]  The protest will be too strong.
[02:40:44.768 --> 02:40:50.013]  We will say that in our lifetime, unless of course there's something
[02:40:52.835 --> 02:41:00.602]  Well, I agree we've got a good chance.
[02:41:00.682 --> 02:41:02.444]  The pro-gun culture is growing.
[02:41:02.504 --> 02:41:03.645]  Women are getting into guns.
[02:41:03.845 --> 02:41:06.587]  People are finding out how great it is to defend yourself.
[02:41:07.108 --> 02:41:09.210]  But what I'm asking is, I really want your opinion on this.
[02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:11.572]  The Homeland Security documents that we broke,
[02:41:13.476 --> 02:41:19.899]  It makes a nexus between gun owners, veterans, it says they're the number one threat, and basically are Al-Qaeda, are white supremacists.
[02:41:20.359 --> 02:41:22.180]  Now I'm seeing that as a drumbeat.
[02:41:22.460 --> 02:41:28.722]  White Al-Qaeda, it's totally asinine that white Al-Qaeda works for bin Laden is going to release anthrax.
[02:41:29.062 --> 02:41:33.624]  What I'm saying is, clearly they're trying to get ready to sic North Com on the American people.
[02:41:34.845 --> 02:41:36.605]  I mean, how asinine is that in your view?
[02:41:36.945 --> 02:41:38.426]  A. B. Will they get away with it?
[02:41:38.726 --> 02:41:42.671]  Well, I don't think that that's going to be one of their first steps.
[02:41:43.472 --> 02:41:48.578]  And yes, they can get away with anything at any given time if the conditions are right.
[02:41:48.918 --> 02:41:51.361]  But we wouldn't see that as the issue right now.
[02:41:54.522 --> 02:41:59.224]  Well they've got a lot of chutzpah though to try to... Well they'll try anything Alex, you know that.
[02:41:59.624 --> 02:42:03.905]  And then they keep throwing out these trial balloons to see how far they'll go.
[02:42:03.925 --> 02:42:12.408]  But the thing that we have to watch out for on an individual basis, as we see it right now, is an economic meltdown.
[02:42:12.868 --> 02:42:34.999]  And people making sure, and for example, with the seed companies you're talking about, planting your own gardens, being as self-sufficient as possible, understanding where your money is, will you be able to get a hold of it, finding careers that are going to pay, because you're not going to be able to get a job going to college with a useless degree that they're putting out now.
[02:42:35.677 --> 02:42:36.277]  All right, stay there.
[02:42:36.317 --> 02:42:38.038]  Final segment with Gerald Cilente.
[02:42:38.058 --> 02:42:40.359]  We'll put his website up on screen for you.
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:42.921]  TrendsResearch.com, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:42:43.261 --> 02:42:45.922]  My sites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:42:46.503 --> 02:42:48.384]  Just always amazing having Gerald Cilente on.
[02:42:48.444 --> 02:42:49.524]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:42:49.544 --> 02:42:52.886]  We'll talk about how he sees the economy unfolding here.
[02:42:53.346 --> 02:43:00.329]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:04.852]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:43:05.112 --> 02:43:10.214]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[02:43:10.714 --> 02:43:17.778]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:43:18.238 --> 02:43:23.200]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[02:43:23.641 --> 02:43:29.083]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:43:29.483 --> 02:43:34.946]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[02:43:35.266 --> 02:43:37.027]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:43:56.863 --> 02:43:58.984]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:43:59.485 --> 02:44:06.469]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:44:07.063 --> 02:44:13.247]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:44:13.568 --> 02:44:15.489]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:44:15.609 --> 02:44:18.051]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:44:18.111 --> 02:44:29.038]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:44:29.699 --> 02:44:30.980]  It's not about left or right.
[02:44:31.380 --> 02:44:32.741]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:44:33.217 --> 02:44:39.543]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:44:40.123 --> 02:44:47.930]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:44:48.390 --> 02:44:49.551]  The Obama Deception.
[02:44:49.972 --> 02:44:51.153]  The people strike back.
[02:44:53.018 --> 02:45:02.101]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:45:02.281 --> 02:45:10.323]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[02:45:10.443 --> 02:45:13.064]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1%
[02:45:13.644 --> 02:45:14.125]  I think so.
[02:45:39.728 --> 02:45:43.530]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[02:45:43.690 --> 02:45:46.512]  Order some today at FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[02:45:46.612 --> 02:45:48.813]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com or call 888-949-3570.
[02:45:48.913 --> 02:45:51.014]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have a
[02:46:07.463 --> 02:46:14.828]  By the way, you can see Gerald Cilente in my film, The Obama Deception, number one film online.
[02:46:14.848 --> 02:46:20.852]  I don't have time to count it all up on YouTube and Google and everywhere, but over 20 million free views of the film online.
[02:46:21.233 --> 02:46:22.794]  And I judge that by success.
[02:46:23.454 --> 02:46:29.558]  I want to reach minds, reach people, stop the globalists from wrecking the planet, have a new renaissance, same thing Gerald Celente wants.
[02:46:29.578 --> 02:46:47.530]  But if you want the high quality DVD with the extras and see it like it's meant to be seen in high quality, instead of cruddy internet, get a prisonplanet.tv membership to see it in high quality, earn it as a DivX, give it to people, or get the high quality DVD at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:52.434]  Gerald Celente, in the four minutes we have left, man, I could have a million more questions for you.
[02:46:53.495 --> 02:46:54.838]  Uh, break it down.
[02:46:56.764 --> 02:47:00.747]  You say Christmas is going to be really bad, then we go into 2010.
[02:47:01.528 --> 02:47:09.874]  How do you see this unfolding, you know, towards depression, and then how do you see the establishment responding?
[02:47:09.894 --> 02:47:13.757]  You've already said war, but specifically, domestically, what's this going to look like?
[02:47:14.037 --> 02:47:16.759]  Domestically, we're going to see crime go through the roof.
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:23.845]  They actually argue that as economic conditions decline, crime doesn't worsen.
[02:47:24.338 --> 02:47:25.319]  Yes, it does.
[02:47:25.839 --> 02:47:29.021]  And all kinds of crime from the top down.
[02:47:29.041 --> 02:47:37.627]  So there's going to be more scammers, more thievery, Wall Street doing more deals to steal every penny they can get.
[02:47:38.388 --> 02:47:42.771]  Crime is going to increase in terms also of gang violence.
[02:47:43.251 --> 02:47:48.314]  We're already seeing it in the numbers across, you know, people buying guns, buying safes.
[02:47:48.935 --> 02:47:49.415]  Only the
[02:47:51.260 --> 02:48:05.514]  The people that can't read the handwriting on the wall are going to be caught with what's going to happen because we're moving in to what we're saying unequivocally is going to be the greatest depression and it's going to be worldwide.
[02:48:06.541 --> 02:48:08.182]  Again, the data doesn't lie.
[02:48:08.382 --> 02:48:11.283]  Globally, the trade is off over 20%.
[02:48:13.404 --> 02:48:16.725]  You can't keep business going with those kind of numbers.
[02:48:17.045 --> 02:48:24.848]  We're going to see a temporary reprieve because of all of the money they're dumping into the system.
[02:48:25.328 --> 02:48:27.049]  So that's going to knock people off.
[02:48:27.370 --> 02:48:43.761]  They're going to believe there's going to be the green shoots of recovery, but when you dump this money manure all over the planet, as they're doing now with the tens of trillions of dollars, it's going to look like recovery, but it's not going to be.
[02:48:44.081 --> 02:48:46.503]  So when it collapses from this one down,
[02:48:47.183 --> 02:49:06.517]  Boy, you better be in a good place, you better have a job that's going to withstand depression-proof tremors, because a lot of people aren't going to make it, house foreclosures are going to skyrocket, and the commercial real estate bubble has already popped, they're just not announcing it.
[02:49:07.742 --> 02:49:08.462]  Absolutely.
[02:49:09.383 --> 02:49:15.667]  You know, a lot of different animals, dolphins, ferrets, they know when a hurricane or tornado is coming the day before, or an earthquake.
[02:49:16.567 --> 02:49:22.390]  Do you think the public sees the political changes, or do you think they instinctively are buying all the guns and safe off the shelves?
[02:49:22.430 --> 02:49:26.053]  I mean, that tells me the public's ready to defend themselves.
[02:49:27.013 --> 02:49:28.894]  The public is ready to defend themselves.
[02:49:28.974 --> 02:49:31.916]  Not so much against the government, nor are we.
[02:49:32.897 --> 02:49:41.185]  My reason, for example, of owning weapons is to defend myself against the lunatics that are running out in the street.
[02:49:41.285 --> 02:49:43.747]  Uneducated, whacked out on drugs.
[02:49:44.427 --> 02:49:45.669]  Their minds are blown.
[02:49:46.009 --> 02:49:51.494]  The bank right around the corner from me, the Key Bank in Kingston, New York, was robbed twice in a week.
[02:49:52.645 --> 02:49:53.045]  Oh, I know.
[02:49:53.085 --> 02:49:59.967]  Crime is just exploding in the news and saying it's not, and the police are under attack, and then they're acting crazy as well.
[02:50:00.247 --> 02:50:01.368]  Society's going nuts.
[02:50:01.828 --> 02:50:05.429]  Gerald Cilente, website is TrendsResearch.com.
[02:50:05.849 --> 02:50:14.832]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, sir, and I look forward to getting an interview with you up in New York for the new Obama film coming out in September.
[02:50:15.152 --> 02:50:17.172]  God bless you, sir, and thank you for spending time with us.
[02:50:17.432 --> 02:50:18.733]  Always my pleasure, Alex.
[02:50:18.893 --> 02:50:19.253]  Thank you.
[02:50:19.873 --> 02:50:20.654]  You better take care.
[02:50:20.694 --> 02:50:23.115]  There goes Gerald Salente, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:23.395 --> 02:50:26.457]  Retransmission starts now at Infowars.com on the audio streams.
[02:50:26.797 --> 02:50:31.500]  Jason Burma's coming up tonight, 9 to midnight, with the new draft bill, National Compulsory Service.
[02:50:31.540 --> 02:50:32.260]  Great job, crew.

[02:50:43.342 --> 02:50:44.904]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:50:45.024 --> 02:50:49.651]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:50:49.771 --> 02:50:52.535]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:50:52.735 --> 02:50:55.659]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:50:55.799 --> 02:51:00.506]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:51:00.726 --> 02:51:01.647]  If you simply prepare.
[02:51:01.847 --> 02:51:04.789]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:51:05.089 --> 02:51:11.993]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
