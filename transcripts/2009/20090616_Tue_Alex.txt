[00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:53.669]  Look at this article.
[00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.750]  It's from Fox News.
[00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:08.792]  It has a disgusting headline where the lawyer for the cop that attacked repeatedly and choked
[00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:19.625]  A veteran EMT driver with no criminal record and all these great citations for his work.
[00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.447]  Now, they assault him on the video.
[00:01:23.507 --> 00:01:28.829]  Not just the cell phone camera video, but now the dash cam video.
[00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.413]  Trooper claims dash cam upload that everybody's now seen on the web
[00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:40.890]  Validates him.
[00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.213]  Headline Trooper Claims Dashboard Cam Upholds His Actions.
[00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:48.454]  This is their craziness.
[00:01:49.075 --> 00:02:00.141]  But before I get to that and break down the mental illness of the establishment, we're now violently pulling over an ambulance with a woman who thinks she's having a heart attack.
[00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.282]  Turned out she had heat stroke.
[00:02:02.363 --> 00:02:07.246]  Going to the hospital and then assaulting the EMTs for no reason.
[00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:22.823]  This is supposedly normal, but I wanted to just, of the hundreds of clips we have that document how the police have gone insane, the cop gets 40 months for beating a man in a wheelchair.
[00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:30.646]  I'm surprised they didn't claim he was talking back and that it was a danger to the public, because that's what they say in this article.
[00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:36.468]  They say the EMT was talking back to the officer and that was a danger to the public, so he deserved what happened to him.
[00:02:37.148 --> 00:02:43.793]  Well, I guess this person in a wheelchair was talking back, and I've got a bunch of videos of somebody in a wheelchair and they'll say, get up, and the person says, I'm paralyzed.
[00:02:44.234 --> 00:02:46.095]  They just throw them out and start beating them.
[00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:55.643]  In a rare instance, and it is rare, of justice, a Chicago cop received a sentence of more than three years in prison for mercilessly beating a man shackled to a wheelchair.
[00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:59.987]  The officer, Thug, was caught on a surveillance video
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.140]  Pummeling the man.
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:14.825]  Like something out of an evil torture chamber, the brutal cop, William Cozy, cuffed the victim's legs with a wheelchair and then struck him with a SAP.
[00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:15.726]  Whatever a SAP is.
[00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:19.087]  He later said the man attacked him, but the video shows otherwise.
[00:03:19.127 --> 00:03:19.867]  They always do that.
[00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:24.049]  Now the new thing is, if a cop says they're forced to punch you in the face,
[00:03:27.327 --> 00:03:29.428]  They will say that you assaulted them.
[00:03:29.928 --> 00:03:37.172]  And I've seen video after video of people not doing this, and they'll say it.
[00:03:38.013 --> 00:03:39.894]  And all these videos are coming out now.
[00:03:39.934 --> 00:03:41.315]  People have hidden cameras in their house.
[00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:44.016]  A cop's planting drugs and going, oh, just found drugs!
[00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:44.756]  You're going to jail!
[00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:53.841]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, here in Texas, and I'd say half the small towns, they just pull you over and take everything you got, and it's on the news, and the cops go on the news and go, yeah, we take your money here.
[00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:55.322]  Don't come through the town.
[00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:01.781]  I mean, and now they want to have databases where if you've criticized the police, the state of Texas is trying to pass this law.
[00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:05.462]  It's on their dash computers with automatic cameras that read all the plates.
[00:04:05.482 --> 00:04:08.663]  When you come through town, they go, oh look, Alex Jones talked bad about us.
[00:04:08.883 --> 00:04:10.904]  He's going to be passing through the light in about a minute.
[00:04:11.204 --> 00:04:13.285]  Well, hey, let me pull out a McDonald's and go over there.
[00:04:13.645 --> 00:04:14.965]  Get out of your car, Jones.
[00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.346]  I'm taking everything you got.
[00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:19.867]  And that's how Texas just operates now, out in the open.
[00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:23.168]  And the cops go and see it and go, we can take whatever we want.
[00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:24.189]  Yeah, I'll keep the money.
[00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:25.069]  Yeah.
[00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:27.258]  We don't have to find drugs on you.
[00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:32.087]  I mean, this is the craziness that's going on.
[00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.972]  So let's go ahead with audio.
[00:04:35.012 --> 00:04:38.518]  Show them the video of them beating someone in a wheelchair.
[00:04:39.787 --> 00:04:40.267]  One of many!
[00:04:40.648 --> 00:04:45.871]  They sit in the one where they tell them to get up, and the person's quadriplegic and can't, so they throw them out, break their bones, and then laugh at them.
[00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:46.411]  Here it is.
[00:05:10.548 --> 00:05:20.434]  No one deserves what took place on that video unless there was some sort of force or harm that was threatened.
[00:05:20.514 --> 00:05:22.635]  Okay, that's a no.
[00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:32.241]  Now, according to that, in fact, YouTube, another one, cripple thrown out of wheelchair, I think should bring it up.
[00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:49.945]  Jail guard throws person on a wheelchair, and this person's paralyzed chest down, and they say, get up, and they say, I can't, I'm paralyzed, and they dump them out, breaking the person's legs, because when you've been paralyzed a long time, your legs turn into like chalk, your muscles turn into like jello, and then it's just funny.
[00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:55.549]  You know, the person in their urine and feces on the ground, and they kind of have a devilish celebration.
[00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:03.641]  The police, by the way, defended that case and said, yeah, no, person didn't get up, doesn't matter if you're paralyzed, you don't follow an order, we break your legs.
[00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:05.062]  See, it's a mental illness.
[00:06:05.542 --> 00:06:08.323]  The code says he didn't follow an order, but he couldn't.
[00:06:08.983 --> 00:06:09.783]  Doesn't matter.
[00:06:11.183 --> 00:06:12.164]  Your legs get broken.
[00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:18.806]  Now, the reason I wanted to go over that is this is the mental illness that we're talking about.
[00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:21.246]  I mean, this has reached craziness potential.
[00:06:22.627 --> 00:06:23.247]  Fox News.
[00:06:23.547 --> 00:06:25.908]  Trooper claims dashboard cam upholds his actions.
[00:06:27.227 --> 00:06:33.089]  For more than three weeks, an infamous cell phone video showing an Oklahoma highway patrolman and a paramedic getting into a scuffle.
[00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.970]  The black guy doesn't touch him.
[00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.030]  The paramedic doesn't touch him.
[00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.651]  They're grabbing, pushing, hitting on him.
[00:06:38.872 --> 00:06:41.232]  He pulls an arm away, they call that attacking him.
[00:06:41.753 --> 00:06:46.134]  In fact, they now charge you if you raise your hand when you're being beaten, that's assault on a god.
[00:06:46.154 --> 00:06:47.735]  I mean, this is god-level.
[00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:50.676]  He'll be wearing gold crowns and we'll have to bow when we see them.
[00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:52.777]  I mean, it's really mentally ill.
[00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:57.870]  As they take the mental patients that have been in Iraq over there doing all that evil, and they take them here.
[00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.051]  This is called tyranny, folks.
[00:07:01.952 --> 00:07:07.956]  Now its counterpart video from the troopers' dashboard cam has been released, and some are saying it vindicates a decorated war hero.
[00:07:08.817 --> 00:07:10.918]  So see, this is ultimate spin.
[00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:16.142]  The video clearly shows the cop out of control, but they've got such arrogance, they'll say it defends him.
[00:07:16.382 --> 00:07:20.505]  We're going to show you that video, unedited, other than some cuss words cut out.
[00:07:22.967 --> 00:07:28.310]  That's coming up, but don't go to it yet, because I want to go through this whole video and leave his audio up while I'm talking.
[00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.391]  I want to pause it as we go through it and break down.
[00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:39.296]  I'm going to read this account of them telling people what it says and only showing short clips on Fox, and then I'm going to show you the unedited video and you decide what's the truth.
[00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:41.737]  Okay.
[00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:45.967]  He is not this org.
[00:07:46.527 --> 00:07:47.367]  Yes, that means a goblin.
[00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:51.289]  This constitutional depriver of people's rights.
[00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:52.049]  He's a good man.
[00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:56.731]  This is a man that has been in law enforcement, no longer peace officer, for 15 years.
[00:07:57.551 --> 00:08:02.293]  He just got back from Iraq, got back in April this year, after a tour of duty for the U.S.
[00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:02.613]  Navy.
[00:08:02.893 --> 00:08:08.815]  Said Attorney Mark James, who came to the defense of his client, Trooper Daniel Martin, at a press conference Monday afternoon.
[00:08:10.526 --> 00:08:18.570]  James claims the dashboard camera upholds his client's story, showing that he acted appropriately in subduing paramedic Maurice White.
[00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:19.371]  Subduing!
[00:08:19.711 --> 00:08:26.094]  White's going, sir, let us just get to the hospital and you can arrest us or ticket us.
[00:08:26.114 --> 00:08:28.575]  This woman is having a heart attack right here.
[00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:31.857]  And he said, wasn't you piece of trash bleeping?
[00:08:32.217 --> 00:08:33.518]  I said get in the car!
[00:08:33.538 --> 00:08:35.579]  And he's going, you can arrest us there.
[00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:40.067]  But this isn't, and he starts saying, I'm going to arrest you now!
[00:08:40.107 --> 00:08:42.169]  And goes into whole freak out and starts choking people.
[00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.612]  But the officer subdued the deadly paramedics.
[00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:52.736]  Oh, he's doing something, he was fighting Iraqis and now he's fighting deadly ambulance people.
[00:08:53.437 --> 00:08:56.119]  It was scary, that ambulance, it was dangerous.
[00:08:56.994 --> 00:08:57.896]  That's what they go on to say.
[00:08:57.916 --> 00:09:00.200]  They say, this ambulance is dangerous people.
[00:09:00.822 --> 00:09:02.004]  Dangerous to the public.
[00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:03.326]  Get ready, actually.
[00:09:03.607 --> 00:09:05.831]  I mean, they're like Al-Qaeda or something.
[00:09:06.573 --> 00:09:08.436]  There's nothing scarier than an ambulance.
[00:09:10.131 --> 00:09:11.733]  Turns out he harasses other ambulances.
[00:09:11.773 --> 00:09:17.940]  He's got like this dominant, crazy power trip where he's God and, that ambulance didn't yield, get out of the car, fool!
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.662]  With a woman having a baby last time.
[00:09:19.962 --> 00:09:22.405]  They're like, sir, can she have the baby?
[00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:24.928]  No, we need to have the... No, she's gonna have the baby right here!
[00:09:24.988 --> 00:09:25.489]  Shut up!
[00:09:25.789 --> 00:09:26.510]  I run things!
[00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.411]  I sit and wait!
[00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:29.173]  Oh God, I got a lot of power.
[00:09:29.213 --> 00:09:30.114]  It's all about his power.
[00:09:30.314 --> 00:09:30.975]  It's a power trip.
[00:09:34.454 --> 00:09:40.636]  James claims the dashboard camera upholds his client's story, showing that he acted appropriately in subduing paramedic Maurice White.
[00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:47.898]  He said that White came out of the ambulance trying to control the situation and was told repeatedly to return to the back of the rig.
[00:09:48.138 --> 00:09:50.378]  See, you don't control, we're in control!
[00:09:50.398 --> 00:09:54.119]  It's all about a threat continuum and how they've got to maintain control.
[00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:56.240]  It's like this mentally ill cult.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.741]  Long way from Matt Dillon.
[00:10:00.021 --> 00:10:01.681]  Matt Dillon out pulling over ambulances.
[00:10:02.162 --> 00:10:03.862]  This is mental illness.
[00:10:07.472 --> 00:10:13.216]  He was asked before there was a curse word, that's defending that, before there was yelling to get back in the ambulance three times.
[00:10:13.676 --> 00:10:15.417]  He did not comply with a lawful order.
[00:10:15.937 --> 00:10:19.539]  James said, no, you were breaking the law, pulling that ambulance over and driving recklessly.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.920]  You need to be charged.
[00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:32.227]  Mr. White committed, by the way, there's a lot of state laws, I don't know about Oklahoma, but a lot of states have it, there's cops killing people, that if you weren't going to an emergency call, you shouldn't have been driving 100 miles an hour, and it's clear you're doing that.
[00:10:32.907 --> 00:10:34.969]  And then running up in the neighborhood, he's going 80.
[00:10:37.093 --> 00:10:41.191]  But if that cop had killed a little kid, there'd have been, he was still chasing a deadly person!
[00:10:41.231 --> 00:10:42.095]  Wait, I'm getting to that part.
[00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:49.317]  Mr. White committed obstruction of justice, and he was told in that video, sir, you're going to be arrested for obstruction.
[00:10:49.637 --> 00:10:50.838]  And he was told that twice.
[00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:52.800]  And the guy said, arrest me at the hospital.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.922]  Let me get the lady who's having a heart attack there.
[00:10:55.602 --> 00:10:58.224]  He does not comply at that point in time.
[00:10:58.264 --> 00:10:59.706]  Yeah, doesn't comply in five seconds.
[00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:01.347]  Get in the freaking car!
[00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:02.408]  Get in the bleeping car!
[00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:03.589]  Get in the car!
[00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:06.531]  You know what I mean?
[00:11:06.551 --> 00:11:07.812]  Just totally mentally ill.
[00:11:07.852 --> 00:11:10.775]  Shouldn't be cleaning toilets, much less running around with a badge and gun.
[00:11:12.898 --> 00:11:16.439]  He is not compliant at that point in time when the trooper tries to make an arrest.
[00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:24.740]  White claimed the trooper was out of control as simply unfounded, and reading White's contradictory statement proves it, James said.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.621]  The guy's completely out of control, screaming.
[00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:33.562]  Then he comes around the side, gets the EMT back out, and starts choking him.
[00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:36.302]  And the other cop's choking him.
[00:11:36.882 --> 00:11:37.903]  That's out of control.
[00:11:37.923 --> 00:11:39.683]  We're going to show both these videos coming up.
[00:11:42.813 --> 00:11:44.774]  The officers, he got out of the vehicles in a state of rage.
[00:11:44.794 --> 00:11:47.796]  He approached my partner and said, get your ass back in there.
[00:11:47.816 --> 00:11:48.936]  Well, that's in a rage.
[00:11:48.996 --> 00:11:50.597]  I'm giving you a ticket for failure to yield.
[00:11:50.897 --> 00:11:53.479]  What do you, what do you mean flipping me off, which they said they didn't do?
[00:11:55.043 --> 00:11:56.864]  I challenge you to go out there and find that.
[00:11:56.884 --> 00:11:57.985]  It didn't happen, James said.
[00:11:58.445 --> 00:12:07.650]  Since the ambulance was not running its lights or siren, James said that Martin had every right to pull over the Creek Nation EMS ambulance on May 24th.
[00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:13.033]  Oklahoma Highway Patrolman, under all circumstances, has the right, I guess they're God, to make a traffic stop.
[00:12:13.293 --> 00:12:18.876]  He has the right to make a traffic stop on an ambulance that is not running code before it has nothing more than any other vehicle, he said.
[00:12:20.177 --> 00:12:24.299]  Martin's attorney also said, because most ambulances only turn their lights on when they need to go through traffic.
[00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:33.345]  Martin's attorney also said if someone thought there was a trooper acted inappropriately, there are a number of things that run through the officer's mind.
[00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.446]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:34.466 --> 00:12:35.547]  Go talk to the state police.
[00:12:35.587 --> 00:12:42.512]  Go talk to the... And he goes on to say, one thing that police officers are taught is that a person who will fight a police officer
[00:12:44.002 --> 00:12:48.465]  Who will fight, I guess talking to him was fighting, is an extreme danger to the public.
[00:12:48.505 --> 00:12:56.310]  And they go on to say how dangerous the guy was for... Now we're going to... I mean, the EMT gets out and is like, what is going on here?
[00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.691]  We got a person in the car.
[00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:00.032]  He's like, get in the car, I said, boy!
[00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:03.034]  And the guy's like, don't talk to us like that.
[00:13:03.654 --> 00:13:04.595]  What's wrong with you?
[00:13:07.317 --> 00:13:08.497]  Somebody stand it up to me.
[00:13:08.557 --> 00:13:09.438]  I'm going crazy.
[00:13:12.369 --> 00:13:13.211]  Totally insane.
[00:13:13.872 --> 00:13:17.157]  And the state police and the governor, everybody, are saying, hey, this is good.
[00:13:17.638 --> 00:13:19.501]  And that's why you're discredited and disliked.
[00:13:19.902 --> 00:13:24.009]  And you make all the other good state police officers who aren't lunatics on power trips look bad.
[00:13:24.735 --> 00:13:26.396]  And it turns out this guy's done this repeatedly.
[00:13:26.836 --> 00:13:30.878]  So, I guess in Iraq, the troops do just sit off the road shooting families up in their cars.
[00:13:30.918 --> 00:13:32.058]  It's on YouTube.
[00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:33.599]  We could show you just killing families for fun.
[00:13:33.619 --> 00:13:35.239]  I mean, I don't... Look, we're humans!
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.200]  We don't... You're not God!
[00:13:37.641 --> 00:13:39.241]  You didn't rise after three days!
[00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:39.901]  I mean, I got news!
[00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:40.742]  This is America!
[00:13:41.082 --> 00:13:42.142]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:13:42.182 --> 00:13:43.543]  Now, land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:13:44.003 --> 00:13:46.204]  Now, let's go ahead and go to the DASH video.
[00:13:46.804 --> 00:13:48.045]  Let's go ahead and start it.
[00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:48.545]  Here it is.
[00:13:49.306 --> 00:13:50.226]  He's driving down the road.
[00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.567]  Go ahead and crank the audio up behind me.
[00:13:55.435 --> 00:14:01.599]  So he's driving along at what appears to be about 85 miles an hour.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.240]  85 to 90.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.002]  Now, here he comes up on an ambulance.
[00:14:07.483 --> 00:14:14.868]  It's at about 600 yards, 300 yards, 200 yards, 100 yards.
[00:14:14.928 --> 00:14:16.209]  I mean, you know, he slows down to about 80.
[00:14:16.249 --> 00:14:18.430]  Now he's about 60.
[00:14:18.751 --> 00:14:20.112]  There's a car.
[00:14:20.132 --> 00:14:20.732]  Stop right there.
[00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:21.192]  Back it up.
[00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:30.973]  The police car has now, at least 90 miles an hour, closed on the back of this ambulance on a two-road, windy, hilly road.
[00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:33.434]  They should be going about 45 on.
[00:14:33.715 --> 00:14:36.836]  He closes in seconds on the ambulance.
[00:14:37.196 --> 00:14:48.801]  The ambulance looks like it's about to get over, but then swerves out, because as they go over the hill, there's a car in the two-foot shoulder, hanging out in the one-lane road, one direction, two lanes total.
[00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.431]  So for those listening on the radio, go to Infowars.com and watch this video.
[00:14:53.071 --> 00:14:56.773]  This is the life-and-death situation that we are witnessing right now.
[00:14:57.133 --> 00:14:59.274]  The ambulance is going the speed limit.
[00:14:59.574 --> 00:15:03.756]  Here comes a bad-out-of-hell cop car on a windy two-lane road.
[00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:07.897]  He's up on his butt, and he's got his lights on.
[00:15:08.037 --> 00:15:12.619]  There's no way, going up over the top of a hill, that the ambulance can go into incoming traffic.
[00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:17.301]  He's stuck between incoming traffic and a car broke down in the road.
[00:15:18.612 --> 00:15:19.673]  Well, the cop doesn't like that.
[00:15:19.713 --> 00:15:22.276]  That ambulance should have just slammed into the back of that car.
[00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.998]  The ribcages should have gone through the steering column.
[00:15:25.018 --> 00:15:28.562]  They should have died and then praised the cop as they died.
[00:15:28.862 --> 00:15:31.024]  And because they didn't do that, they're going to pay.
[00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:32.306]  Back it up and show them.
[00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:32.706]  Here he comes.
[00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:33.407]  Bad out of hell.
[00:15:33.607 --> 00:15:34.328]  Back it up even more.
[00:15:34.628 --> 00:15:35.789]  Back it up even more.
[00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.030]  Bad out of hell.
[00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:41.459]  Up on the back of this, and then look at that rotten shoulder right there.
[00:15:41.479 --> 00:15:42.680]  See how the shoulder's all rotten?
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.862]  It's only a two-foot shoulder, but it's rotten like it is in rural areas.
[00:15:46.203 --> 00:15:47.604]  Just rotten shoulder.
[00:15:48.044 --> 00:15:49.565]  Here comes Speed Racer.
[00:15:50.686 --> 00:15:51.346]  90 miles an hour.
[00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:52.547]  90 miles an hour.
[00:15:52.587 --> 00:15:52.867]  Closing.
[00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:53.308]  80 miles an hour.
[00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:53.848]  He slows to 70.
[00:16:04.178 --> 00:16:04.938]  Two-lane road.
[00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:08.480]  Ambulance has to go out in front of the God because of a car in the lane.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.342]  The ambulance drivers should have killed themselves ramming into the car.
[00:16:13.082 --> 00:16:17.785]  He speeds around them up over the crest of a hill dangerously and accelerates.
[00:16:19.366 --> 00:16:20.806]  He's going 90 miles an hour.
[00:16:20.826 --> 00:16:23.208]  That looks about like a 95 right there.
[00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:24.408]  He slows down around a turn.
[00:16:25.148 --> 00:16:25.789]  80 miles an hour.
[00:16:29.161 --> 00:16:31.763]  He's going through now a residential area.
[00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:34.565]  Appears to be going about a hundred miles an hour right now.
[00:16:36.747 --> 00:16:38.548]  And he speeds into a gas station.
[00:16:39.028 --> 00:16:40.769]  They said they got a report of a stolen car.
[00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.872]  He's doing about a hundred right there.
[00:16:44.973 --> 00:16:45.853]  Through neighborhoods.
[00:16:47.294 --> 00:16:51.577]  And now he pulls in to the gas station.
[00:16:51.597 --> 00:16:53.198]  There's a whole bunch of police cars there.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.181]  And now he decides to leave.
[00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.096]  Now he's going to go after the ambulance.
[00:16:59.116 --> 00:17:08.002]  Now he's going to speed through the neighborhood towards the hospital at speeds of 70 to 80 miles an hour in an area that guaranteed was no more than 20 mile an hour zone.
[00:17:09.023 --> 00:17:12.225]  Now here he goes into the 20 mile an hour zone recklessly.
[00:17:12.245 --> 00:17:16.348]  When we come back we'll play the confrontation and then the up-close video of them choking him.
[00:17:17.228 --> 00:17:18.469]  So that is coming up.
[00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.152]  Now you've already seen the reckless driving, the lunacy, almost driving the
[00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:26.978]  Ambulance into a stalled car.
[00:17:28.238 --> 00:17:32.039]  Risking the god's own life, but I guess gods can't die, so he's immortal.
[00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:34.140]  Risking Hercules, he's half god.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.702]  Hercules, the war hero, risked his own life, goes out into the oncoming to go around.
[00:17:41.088 --> 00:17:42.889]  Lord knows he's bored all day out there in the country.
[00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.931]  Must be the first big call he's had in a month.
[00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.912]  He's got some Iraqis to fight, I mean American people.
[00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:51.675]  So he accelerates on down the road towards the ambulance.
[00:17:52.455 --> 00:17:54.736]  The ambulance thinks they woke up in the Twilight Zone.
[00:17:55.497 --> 00:17:56.558]  It is the Twilight Zone.
[00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:58.859]  Next stop, the Twilight Zone.
[00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:01.089]  You worry.
[00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.311]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:18:03.591 --> 00:18:03.851]  Hi.
[00:18:04.131 --> 00:18:06.633]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:18:06.913 --> 00:18:11.156]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:18:11.456 --> 00:18:13.638]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:16.980]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.002]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:18:19.222 --> 00:18:21.743]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:18:22.004 --> 00:18:25.426]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:18:25.726 --> 00:18:29.769]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.912]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:18:34.212 --> 00:18:40.216]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:18:40.556 --> 00:18:42.698]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:18:42.898 --> 00:18:44.579]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.222]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:18:49.683 --> 00:18:50.323]  Start now.
[00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:51.544]  Knowledge is power.
[00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:53.105]  Better take action.
[00:18:53.305 --> 00:18:54.266]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:19:01.184 --> 00:19:06.490]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:12.536]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:19:13.097 --> 00:19:16.080]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.282]  That Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:19:19.602 --> 00:19:21.423]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:19:21.564 --> 00:19:23.945]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:19:24.025 --> 00:19:34.972]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:19:37.214 --> 00:19:38.495]  It's not about left or right.
[00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:40.276]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:45.079]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,
[00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:47.028]  And his real agenda.

[00:19:57.486 --> 00:19:58.688]  The people strike back.

[00:21:21.212 --> 00:21:26.316]  I've got three different sources, one of them a trusted source in Washington, D.C.
[00:21:28.918 --> 00:21:30.899]  that Von Bruin was being federally handled.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.882]  That's going to be breaking here in the next few days, sooner rather than later.
[00:21:35.963 --> 00:21:37.104]  Dangerous info to have.
[00:21:37.144 --> 00:21:42.468]  In fact, I may just have to get one of the witnesses on before the show ends.
[00:21:42.508 --> 00:21:44.529]  I don't like holding on to this type of info.
[00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.332]  We have little rules around here that keep us a little bit safe so we can finish our mission.
[00:21:51.804 --> 00:21:54.786]  I've just been so busy with other stuff, I haven't been spending all the time on this.
[00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.327]  I should have the last few days working on it.
[00:21:56.347 --> 00:21:58.428]  All right, let's finish up.
[00:21:59.869 --> 00:22:03.591]  Go back to the video, and then we'll back our next guest up to like 15 after.
[00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.232]  Go ahead and call him and let him know that.
[00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:06.813]  Thank you.
[00:22:10.155 --> 00:22:15.678]  Jaron in there, Jaron Neihart, running things, pointed out something that I noticed last night and forgotten to make the point.
[00:22:17.399 --> 00:22:19.240]  The ambulance has seconds.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.061]  I mean, this police car comes flying up
[00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.091]  on him so fast, he has no way to get out of the way.
[00:22:24.111 --> 00:22:35.138]  And I've told you, I've been driving back from Church, Texas, or driving up I-35 through Church, Texas, and there's this blue Charger that I see fly up on people's tails every time I'm down there.
[00:22:35.158 --> 00:22:36.419]  He must be out there giving tickets 24-7.
[00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:37.659]  He did it to me.
[00:22:37.779 --> 00:22:42.963]  Three-lane I-35, I'm in the slow lane, cruise control at 70, because I don't want to get tickets in that speed trap.
[00:22:43.883 --> 00:22:45.905]  And he flies up on my tail.
[00:22:46.165 --> 00:22:56.153]  By the time I see it, literally, this dark blue Charger goes 100 miles an hour, right up behind me, almost hits me three feet and goes, flies out and shoots on down the road.
[00:22:56.213 --> 00:22:58.114]  I mean, just absolute reckless driving.
[00:22:58.514 --> 00:22:59.795]  Absolutely psychopathic.
[00:23:00.396 --> 00:23:02.077]  Well, this cop's not driving that reckless.
[00:23:02.097 --> 00:23:04.259]  He's driving fast on these windy, rotten roads.
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.662]  And in seconds, he's up on that, that
[00:23:10.126 --> 00:23:15.630]  Ambulance, and the ambulance can't get over because there's a car in the breakdown lane.
[00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:17.991]  So as soon as it can, it gets over.
[00:23:18.091 --> 00:23:19.252]  Whirrrr-fast!
[00:23:19.472 --> 00:23:22.214]  Because, I mean, they know God's about to come after them and strike them down.
[00:23:22.254 --> 00:23:24.955]  If they don't, bolts of lightning are going to hit them in the form of a taser.
[00:23:25.276 --> 00:23:28.218]  So you see them get over, not fast enough.
[00:23:28.318 --> 00:23:36.283]  I mean, the only way that cop would have been happy on this power trip is if they'd have gone, all right, say goodbye, God, I'm coming home, and just steered right into that car.
[00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:38.298]  And hope they lived.
[00:23:38.639 --> 00:23:40.460]  And the cop was still there, you piece of filth!
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.281]  Learn to get out of my way quicker!
[00:23:42.341 --> 00:23:43.081]  Die better!
[00:23:43.461 --> 00:23:44.262]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:23:44.562 --> 00:23:51.266]  I mean, literally, this is the mental illness we're seeing, and the cop's so delusional, he thinks, yeah, well they deserved it, huh?
[00:23:51.606 --> 00:23:53.667]  I'm gonna give you a ticket, you son of a bitch!
[00:23:53.707 --> 00:23:55.328]  Ha ha, yeah!
[00:23:55.428 --> 00:23:56.489]  And that's all coming up.
[00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:59.810]  So play that video again, from his squad car.
[00:24:00.091 --> 00:24:00.411]  Here it is.
[00:24:05.973 --> 00:24:07.454]  Boom, there's the car in the breakdown lane.
[00:24:07.714 --> 00:24:09.375]  They swerve to get out of God's way.
[00:24:10.176 --> 00:24:13.838]  God going up the top of the hill at the crest, goes ahead and shoots over dangerously.
[00:24:15.719 --> 00:24:19.422]  I mean, I would say that ambulance dangerously pulled over for him.
[00:24:20.042 --> 00:24:22.404]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:24:22.424 --> 00:24:23.645]  See, that's like a game to cops.
[00:24:23.885 --> 00:24:24.826]  They're supposed to yield to me.
[00:24:24.886 --> 00:24:25.426]  It's the law.
[00:24:25.646 --> 00:24:31.150]  So I'm going to fly up on this family in a minivan at 100 miles an hour on I-35 and almost hit them.
[00:24:32.815 --> 00:24:35.277]  Nobody can stop me and I'll kill that whole family!
[00:24:35.297 --> 00:24:36.397]  They give me a problem!
[00:24:37.137 --> 00:24:38.798]  Yeah, just driving however they want.
[00:24:39.259 --> 00:24:40.699]  That's how America operates.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.840]  Alright, we've already shown this.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.283]  Fast forward now to him pulling the ambulance back over after he goes to the call and there's no problem.
[00:24:47.643 --> 00:24:50.644]  Now he, let's get him on his way from leaving the gas station.
[00:24:50.664 --> 00:24:52.645]  He now drives recklessly.
[00:24:54.646 --> 00:24:57.808]  Here he is, driving recklessly in the neighborhood to get to the ambulance.
[00:24:58.308 --> 00:24:58.788]  Here we go.
[00:24:59.329 --> 00:25:01.710]  Here goes Speed Racer with kids on their Hot Wheels playing.
[00:25:03.671 --> 00:25:04.111]  Crank it up.
[00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:04.512]  Let's do it.
[00:25:07.575 --> 00:25:08.296]  And now we're going.
[00:25:08.316 --> 00:25:09.997]  Now we're up to 70 in the neighborhood.
[00:25:10.017 --> 00:25:11.539]  Now we're up to 80.
[00:25:14.181 --> 00:25:15.683]  Flying up on their tail.
[00:25:16.304 --> 00:25:16.864]  Pull over.
[00:25:16.964 --> 00:25:18.025]  And boy, they pull over quick.
[00:25:18.386 --> 00:25:21.469]  So here's an ambulance being pulled over in a neighborhood on the way to the hospital.
[00:25:22.406 --> 00:25:23.967]  When we come back, we'll get to this, okay?
[00:25:24.067 --> 00:25:24.867]  Hit pause right there.
[00:25:25.388 --> 00:25:26.588]  You want to see insanity.
[00:25:26.628 --> 00:25:27.849]  You want to see mental illness.
[00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:29.309]  You're going to see it.
[00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:34.152]  And they're in the news saying that EMTs are dangerous to the public.
[00:25:34.912 --> 00:25:37.774]  This is incredible.
[00:25:37.794 --> 00:25:39.435]  We'll be right back.
[00:25:42.116 --> 00:25:45.498]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:26:53.432 --> 00:26:55.373]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:55.833 --> 00:26:58.714]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:05.056 --> 00:27:05.656]  Big Brother.
[00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:07.395]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:08.136 --> 00:27:09.217]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:09.897 --> 00:27:10.698]  You want answers?
[00:27:11.478 --> 00:27:12.379]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:12.399 --> 00:27:16.703]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:17.223 --> 00:27:21.307]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:22.688 --> 00:27:26.631]  We are live simulcast on the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:30.655]  The state is going mentally ill, like they always do, thinking they're God.
[00:27:34.301 --> 00:27:39.787]  The Oklahoma Highway Patrol, I dropped this issue, but they lied and said the black guy, the EMT, assaulted them.
[00:27:40.508 --> 00:27:44.232]  Now the dash cam's released and they're in the news calling this an assault.
[00:27:45.674 --> 00:27:46.956]  And calling this resisting.
[00:27:47.456 --> 00:27:51.981]  For the cop car violently almost running the ambulance off the road, as you just saw.
[00:27:52.882 --> 00:27:54.644]  The ambulance instantly getting over.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:11.970]  The second after they're able to, literally in two and a half seconds, trying to miss a car in the breakdown lane, and this nut, lunatic road rage, showing off to his wife, riding around with him, runs up and gets to boss hard-working servicemen that save lives.
[00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:13.491]  He enjoys it.
[00:28:14.892 --> 00:28:15.552]  Total punk.
[00:28:16.753 --> 00:28:18.214]  Just a venomous worm.
[00:28:19.452 --> 00:28:21.173]  And everything that is anti-American.
[00:28:21.273 --> 00:28:22.233]  It's just disgusting.
[00:28:22.953 --> 00:28:28.595]  Absolutely disgusting that they would then demonize the EMT saying he's a criminal.
[00:28:29.155 --> 00:28:30.276]  You people have no shame.
[00:28:30.816 --> 00:28:41.120]  Now, this is him pulling the ambulance over and the ambulance driver gets out, the head ambulance EMT who's in the back with a lady that thinks he's having a heart attack, gets out and is like, Sir, what's going on?
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.260]  Talk to me, I'm in charge.
[00:28:43.374 --> 00:28:46.276]  And he calls him Sir, he calls him God.
[00:28:46.296 --> 00:28:47.937]  That's not enough, boy!
[00:28:47.957 --> 00:28:48.998]  You gotta lick his boots!
[00:28:49.038 --> 00:28:49.699]  Go ahead and play it!
[00:28:53.802 --> 00:28:54.822]  Here he is in the neighborhood.
[00:28:55.403 --> 00:28:56.764]  Jumping out, showing off.
[00:28:58.205 --> 00:28:58.565]  Now.
[00:28:58.845 --> 00:28:59.946]  Eric!
[00:29:00.126 --> 00:29:00.727]  Now!
[00:29:00.987 --> 00:29:04.069]  Oh, you now!
[00:29:04.169 --> 00:29:05.150]  What's going on?
[00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.251]  What's going on?
[00:29:06.491 --> 00:29:07.531]  I'm talking to the driver.
[00:29:07.552 --> 00:29:08.552]  No, no, I'm talking to you.
[00:29:10.256 --> 00:29:10.817]  Rewind that.
[00:29:11.258 --> 00:29:13.502]  The second he gets out, he's yelling at him.
[00:29:14.123 --> 00:29:15.064]  What is he yelling there?
[00:29:15.084 --> 00:29:15.765]  Back that up.
[00:29:17.428 --> 00:29:18.570]  He just jumps out.
[00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.071]  Hey, you there!
[00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:19.492]  You there!
[00:29:22.183 --> 00:29:27.404]  And imagine the guy in the back with the woman they think is having a heart attack, turns out it was heat stroke, going, what on earth is this?
[00:29:28.345 --> 00:29:30.665]  Turns out this guy pulls ambulances over routinely.
[00:29:30.765 --> 00:29:31.125]  Here it is.
[00:29:52.543 --> 00:29:53.323]  You understand me?
[00:29:53.604 --> 00:29:55.965]  And I won't put up with you talking to my driver like that.
[00:29:55.985 --> 00:29:57.105]  I ain't listening to you, buddy!
[00:29:57.225 --> 00:29:59.726]  You get your ass back in that ambulance or I'll take you in!
[00:29:59.767 --> 00:30:00.427]  I'm talking to the driver!
[00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:01.687]  I'll take you in if you would.
[00:30:01.707 --> 00:30:02.488]  Come over here, Paul.
[00:30:02.708 --> 00:30:03.548]  We got a patient.
[00:30:03.608 --> 00:30:05.729]  No, we got a patient in this joint right now.
[00:30:05.769 --> 00:30:10.692]  Okay, you want to go ahead and pull over to the side of the road when there's an emergency vehicle behind you?
[00:30:11.592 --> 00:30:16.076]  This lunatic comes up on an ambulance at 90 miles an hour!
[00:30:16.757 --> 00:30:28.787]  The ambulance tries to pull over, comes over the top of a hill, sees a car broke down, barely survives it, and then gets over because he's so scared of the cops because they've been pulling him over in that area, that same crazy man, with pregnant women.
[00:30:30.068 --> 00:30:33.351]  It's like I'm tasering pregnant women because the husband speeds in DC.
[00:30:33.571 --> 00:30:34.471]  They're nuts!
[00:30:35.232 --> 00:30:35.953]  They're nuts!
[00:30:35.973 --> 00:30:37.194]  They're on power trips!
[00:30:39.019 --> 00:30:44.641]  And he's screaming at him saying, you learned to pull over, when they did to the God!
[00:30:44.661 --> 00:30:54.125]  I mean, just a little... on record you're in the wrong, and you don't care, you're gonna go attack this man you've already attacked physically.
[00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:57.971]  God, we just need to start, just work.
[00:30:58.011 --> 00:30:59.312]  Okay, fine, you want to be worshipped?
[00:30:59.653 --> 00:31:00.593]  Oh, you are God.
[00:31:00.894 --> 00:31:02.275]  Oh, you hung the moon.
[00:31:02.615 --> 00:31:04.557]  Oh, I mean, what is wrong with you people?
[00:31:05.137 --> 00:31:07.019]  Go ahead and play more of it as we go out to break.
[00:31:07.339 --> 00:31:15.606]  Pause again, rewind it again.
[00:31:16.066 --> 00:31:16.967]  Rewind the whole thing.
[00:31:18.869 --> 00:31:21.211]  He's saying, you didn't yield to me, and he goes, what do you mean?
[00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:22.492]  The way you ran up on me?
[00:31:23.905 --> 00:31:24.686]  We did yield.
[00:31:24.706 --> 00:31:26.407]  And he's like, no you didn't!
[00:31:26.607 --> 00:31:28.168]  You don't tell an officer he's wrong!
[00:31:28.368 --> 00:31:29.409]  This lunatic!
[00:31:30.229 --> 00:31:31.750]  I had an Austin PD one night.
[00:31:32.531 --> 00:31:35.793]  I pulled out of the office on the access road of 290 right here.
[00:31:37.174 --> 00:31:39.535]  There's three lanes on the access road here.
[00:31:40.256 --> 00:31:41.737]  There's not even headlights behind me.
[00:31:41.797 --> 00:31:43.097]  A cop car had to be going 95, 100.
[00:31:43.218 --> 00:31:45.099]  It just zooms up.
[00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:46.079]  All I see is lights.
[00:31:46.139 --> 00:31:47.100]  They don't have the cherries on.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.241]  It almost hits me.
[00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:56.399]  I look over and the cop violently pulls up and shines a light in my eye and then speeds off.
[00:31:56.719 --> 00:32:00.645]  I'm lucky he didn't pull me out of the car, shoot me in the head and go, I got power!
[00:32:00.845 --> 00:32:05.612]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:32:05.812 --> 00:32:06.373]  Number one.
[00:32:06.613 --> 00:32:09.594]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.834 --> 00:32:10.074]  Number 2.
[00:32:10.534 --> 00:32:15.435]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:15.735 --> 00:32:16.175]  It's true.
[00:32:16.375 --> 00:32:20.576]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.816 --> 00:32:21.056]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.716 --> 00:32:27.157]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:32:27.337 --> 00:32:27.557]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.017 --> 00:32:30.658]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:32:30.918 --> 00:32:34.319]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:34.579 --> 00:32:34.779]  Number 5.
[00:32:35.439 --> 00:32:39.062]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:32:39.282 --> 00:32:44.766]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:32:45.006 --> 00:32:49.569]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.709 --> 00:32:51.250]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.812]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[00:33:00.606 --> 00:33:02.187]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:33:02.287 --> 00:33:06.948]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:33:07.048 --> 00:33:09.789]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:33:09.989 --> 00:33:12.870]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:17.752]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:33:17.992 --> 00:33:18.913]  If you simply prepare.

[00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:56.133]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.682]  Okay, we got a guest coming up on the economy and I want to take more of your calls.
[00:35:17.742 --> 00:35:20.724]  We'll also have open phones in the fourth hour and a ton of news I haven't gotten to.
[00:35:21.265 --> 00:35:22.946]  But I'm not here to bash cops.
[00:35:23.386 --> 00:35:27.169]  It doesn't help me if I just bash cops in the military all day.
[00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:32.613]  But the military, constitutionally and historically, can't be used domestically in law enforcement.
[00:35:32.853 --> 00:35:34.134]  Northcom's announced they are.
[00:35:34.594 --> 00:35:37.457]  They're putting them in major police departments, small departments.
[00:35:37.717 --> 00:35:39.799]  They're saying they're going to take on the American people.
[00:35:40.099 --> 00:35:44.022]  Then the DHS reports say the number one threat is veterans and conservatives and gun owners.
[00:35:44.543 --> 00:35:46.564]  Fox is saying, oh, look at Von Brun.
[00:35:47.325 --> 00:35:49.086]  We deserve to do DHS.
[00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:49.687]  It's right.
[00:35:49.727 --> 00:35:50.728]  The veterans are bad.
[00:35:51.008 --> 00:35:54.391]  They're teaching all the local departments that the vets are all going to be bombing them soon.
[00:35:54.711 --> 00:35:56.332]  Why would vets be bombing you soon?
[00:35:56.692 --> 00:35:59.615]  What is it the government's going to do so bad that vets would start bombing?
[00:36:01.314 --> 00:36:04.876]  See, you're an illegitimate government, and you're getting ready for war with the people.
[00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:11.778]  And this brainwashed vet, who thinks he's God, almost runs an ambulance off the road.
[00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:13.739]  The ambulance instantly gets over.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.820]  Instantly!
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.581]  Here comes the car, 90 miles an hour.
[00:36:17.061 --> 00:36:18.161]  That ambulance is over.
[00:36:19.542 --> 00:36:26.925]  And then he drives recklessly through a neighborhood, chases the ambulance down, gets out,
[00:36:28.297 --> 00:36:31.241]  And starts yelling at him, telling him, you didn't get over quick.
[00:36:31.281 --> 00:36:34.245]  And the head EMT goes, you ran up on us.
[00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:35.287]  We got over.
[00:36:35.968 --> 00:36:37.630]  Play it from the time he jumps out again.
[00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.092]  And we're going to mute.
[00:36:39.172 --> 00:36:39.773]  We haven't edited this.
[00:36:39.793 --> 00:36:40.915]  We're going to mute the cuss words.
[00:36:40.935 --> 00:36:42.977]  So they're in there trying their best to mute it.
[00:36:43.658 --> 00:36:44.059]  Here we go.
[00:36:44.299 --> 00:36:44.740]  Here's the video.
[00:36:54.216 --> 00:36:54.476]  Now.
[00:36:55.216 --> 00:36:55.516]  There!
[00:36:55.757 --> 00:36:56.077]  Now!
[00:36:56.797 --> 00:36:57.417]  Oh, you now.
[00:36:57.437 --> 00:36:58.097]  What's the problem?
[00:36:58.117 --> 00:36:58.778]  What's going on?
[00:36:58.898 --> 00:37:00.198]  I'm talking to the driver.
[00:37:00.238 --> 00:37:01.118]  No, no, I'm talking to you.
[00:37:01.138 --> 00:37:01.658]  I'm the medic.
[00:37:01.678 --> 00:37:03.239]  No, you better get back in that ambulance.
[00:37:03.339 --> 00:37:04.419]  I'm talking to the driver.
[00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:05.840]  I'm in charge of this unit, sir.
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.220]  Okay.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.380]  My name is Maurice White.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.681]  I'm a critical care paramedic.
[00:37:08.801 --> 00:37:14.443]  I'm going to give you a ticket from failure to yield, and when I go by you saying what's going on, you don't need to give me no hand gestures now.
[00:37:14.463 --> 00:37:15.443]  I ain't going to put up with it.
[00:37:15.823 --> 00:37:16.644]  You understand me?
[00:37:16.924 --> 00:37:19.286]  And I won't put up with you talking to my driver like that.
[00:37:19.306 --> 00:37:20.426]  I ain't listening to you, buddy!
[00:37:20.547 --> 00:37:23.028]  You get your ass back in that ambulance, or I'll take you in!
[00:37:23.068 --> 00:37:24.169]  I'm talking to the driver!
[00:37:24.229 --> 00:37:25.010]  Only if you would.
[00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.850]  Come over here, Paul.
[00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:26.851]  No, we got a patient.
[00:37:26.931 --> 00:37:28.973]  No, we got a patient in this joint, right now.
[00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:35.317]  Okay, you want to go ahead and pull over to the side of the road when there's an emergency vehicle behind you?
[00:37:35.437 --> 00:37:37.939]  I did not run up on you quickly.
[00:37:37.959 --> 00:37:39.740]  I did not run up on you quickly, buddy.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.301]  Yes, you did.
[00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:43.483]  You better get back in that ambulance before you get your butts in jail now.
[00:37:43.563 --> 00:37:44.344]  You understand me?
[00:37:44.884 --> 00:37:46.445]  We've got to get my patient to the hospital.
[00:37:46.465 --> 00:37:47.545]  You can take him to jail.
[00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:48.225]  We'll discuss this, okay?
[00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:48.486]  No, no.
[00:37:48.506 --> 00:37:49.406]  I've got a patient in this... Hey!
[00:37:49.466 --> 00:37:49.546]  Hey!

[00:38:03.372 --> 00:38:03.432]  Hey!
[00:38:03.452 --> 00:38:03.512]  Hey
[00:38:14.144 --> 00:38:15.489]  He's totally controlled.
[00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:17.536]  He's, I've got a patient, sir.
[00:38:19.203 --> 00:38:20.527]  We can do this at the hospital.
[00:38:22.703 --> 00:38:28.927]  No, it's all about him and his weird lawyer is in the paper saying that he didn't follow an order and they didn't get out of his way.
[00:38:29.547 --> 00:38:30.588]  You guys are cuckoo!
[00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:32.929]  Do you really believe the crap you're shoveling in people?
[00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:44.757]  You're trying to run an ambulance off the road, driving around like a maniac in neighborhoods, and then you assault people and choke them and all this stuff, and then they're the ones that are bad?
[00:38:46.912 --> 00:38:48.753]  I mean, you people are out of your minds.
[00:38:49.653 --> 00:38:50.933]  But you work for criminal bankers.
[00:38:50.953 --> 00:38:54.335]  They put you in power to carry out criminal activity against the people.
[00:38:54.575 --> 00:38:55.635]  And you're doing a great job.
[00:38:55.915 --> 00:38:56.916]  You're out of your mind.
[00:38:57.436 --> 00:38:59.236]  The sick part is these cops don't even think they're evil.
[00:38:59.436 --> 00:39:00.817]  They really believe they're on baloney.
[00:39:01.537 --> 00:39:04.238]  But the good cops out there, they're ashamed of you.
[00:39:04.638 --> 00:39:07.739]  And it's too bad you're tarnishing their name and the sacrifices they make.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.241]  You are a shame to everybody.
[00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:12.001]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.351]  Before you get your butt to jail now.
[00:39:14.431 --> 00:39:15.231]  You understand me?
[00:39:15.272 --> 00:39:17.273]  We gotta get my patient to the hospital.
[00:39:17.313 --> 00:39:18.814]  You can take him to jail.
[00:39:18.834 --> 00:39:19.694]  We'll discuss this, okay?
[00:39:19.734 --> 00:39:20.014]  Discuss?
[00:39:20.054 --> 00:39:20.735]  Come here, Paul.
[00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:20.955]  No, no.
[00:39:20.995 --> 00:39:23.717]  I got a patient in this... Get your ass... Turn around!
[00:39:24.037 --> 00:39:24.257]  Hey!
[00:39:24.297 --> 00:39:24.437]  Hey!
[00:39:24.517 --> 00:39:24.777]  Hey!

[00:39:31.401 --> 00:39:31.622]  Hey!
[00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:32.042]  Hey!
[00:39:32.062 --> 00:39:32.122]  Hey!
[00:39:32.202 --> 00:39:32.342]  Hey!
[00:39:32.402 --> 00:39:32.542]  Hey!
[00:39:32.582 --> 00:39:32.762]  Hey!
[00:39:32.842 --> 00:39:33.002]  Hey!
[00:39:33.102 --> 00:39:33.263]  Hey!
[00:39:33.343 --> 00:39:33.603]  Hey!
[00:39:33.663 --> 00:39:33.883]  Hey!
[00:39:33.923 --> 00:39:34.003]  Hey!
[00:39:34.023 --> 00:39:34.183]  Hey!
[00:39:34.243 --> 00:39:34.303]  Hey!
[00:39:34.463 --> 00:39:34.643]  Hey!
[00:39:34.784 --> 00:39:34.984]  Hey!
[00:39:35.064 --> 00:39:35.164]  Hey!
[00:39:35.184 --> 00:39:35.344]  Hey!
[00:39:35.424 --> 00:39:35.604]  Hey!
[00:39:35.684 --> 00:39:35.784]  Hey!
[00:39:35.864 --> 00:39:36.064]  Hey!
[00:39:36.084 --> 00:39:36.164]  Hey!
[00:39:36.304 --> 00:39:36.545]  Hey!
[00:39:36.565 --> 00:39:36.625]  Hey!
[00:39:36.685 --> 00:39:36.845]  Hey!
[00:39:36.905 --> 00:39:37.025]  Hey!
[00:39:37.045 --> 00:39:37.205]  Hey!
[00:39:37.225 --> 00:39:37.325]  Hey!
[00:39:37.405 --> 00:39:37.565]  Hey!
[00:39:37.665 --> 00:39:37.765]  Hey!
[00:39:37.825 --> 00:39:38.005]  Hey!
[00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:38.246]  Hey!
[00:39:38.286 --> 00:39:38.446]  Hey!
[00:39:38.486 --> 00:39:38.686]  Hey!
[00:39:38.786 --> 00:39:38.886]  Hey!
[00:39:38.906 --> 00:39:39.026]  Hey!
[00:39:39.086 --> 00:39:39.266]  Hey!
[00:39:39.286 --> 00:39:39.526]  Hey!
[00:39:39.626 --> 00:39:39.807]  Hey!
[00:39:39.867 --> 00:39:40.027]  Hey!
[00:39:40.167 --> 00:39:40.387]  Hey!
[00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:40.527]  Hey!
[00:39:40.607 --> 00:39:40.727]  Hey!
[00:39:40.807 --> 00:39:40.867]  Hey!
[00:39:40.887 --> 00:39:41.067]  Hey!
[00:39:41.127 --> 00:39:41.287]  Hey!
[00:39:41.308 --> 00:39:41.408]  Hey!
[00:39:41.588 --> 00:39:41.828]  Hey!
[00:39:41.908 --> 00:39:42.108]  Hey!
[00:39:42.248 --> 00:39:43.929]  Now here's the EMT.
[00:39:44.289 --> 00:39:48.851]  As they're choking him, another cop's running around now.
[00:40:11.127 --> 00:40:15.711]  And we have the video up close of that from the handheld camera, the cell phone camera.
[00:40:16.052 --> 00:40:20.456]  He's calmly being choked and they're saying, turn down, you know, submit, don't fight back, while they're choking him.
[00:40:20.796 --> 00:40:24.119]  And he's sitting there calmly with his hands going, you're the one choking me, calm down.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.401]  He's the real man.
[00:40:25.701 --> 00:40:28.063]  He's the guy on the right who put up with your crap.
[00:40:28.804 --> 00:40:32.748]  I don't know if I can handle somebody shoving me around, attacking me, acting all nuts in my face.
[00:40:33.871 --> 00:40:43.838]  And the cop starts assaulting him, and the big black guy's just controlling him with ease, going, now stop that, until the next cop shows up and he figures out, these cops are about to kill me, I better let them go ahead and hurt me.
[00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:49.541]  And he goes, okay, go ahead and hurt me, and they get off on the cult of torturing him, and you see them getting off on it.
[00:40:49.561 --> 00:40:51.663]  I mean, you guys are out of your minds.
[00:40:52.143 --> 00:40:53.164]  And then finally, another...
[00:40:54.574 --> 00:40:59.917]  Higher-level state police shows up and tells them stop it because it's obviously very embarrassing and insane.
[00:41:00.797 --> 00:41:03.138]  Finally, a state trooper with half a brain shows up here in the background.
[00:41:03.378 --> 00:41:04.419]  Okay, that's enough, let him go.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.861]  But the two lunatics that first show up, they're just out of their minds!
[00:41:11.783 --> 00:41:13.343]  Out of your minds!
[00:41:14.724 --> 00:41:15.885]  Out of your minds!
[00:41:18.203 --> 00:41:24.408]  Don't you even care about yourselves driving around at 90 miles an hour on windy, hilly roads with rotten shoulders in Oklahoma?
[00:41:25.268 --> 00:41:26.629]  As bad as the roads in East Texas?
[00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:31.493]  And the ambulance pulls over instantly for you and that's not good enough?
[00:41:31.873 --> 00:41:33.935]  You flip out because you're showing off for your wife?
[00:41:34.395 --> 00:41:36.657]  You've got PTSD, guaranteed.
[00:41:36.677 --> 00:41:37.557]  You're out of your mind.
[00:41:37.878 --> 00:41:42.501]  Admit you did wrong and start being a man instead of acting like a big baby.
[00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:46.284]  Because you're going to lose all the respect you got with the people.
[00:41:47.642 --> 00:41:49.022]  And it's not going to go well for the police.
[00:41:49.142 --> 00:41:50.043]  I'm just telling you right now.
[00:41:50.103 --> 00:41:52.943]  The people are getting sick of your red coat activities.
[00:41:54.324 --> 00:41:58.145]  Alright, I apologize about getting our guest on ten minutes late, but I wanted to finish that video.
[00:42:01.286 --> 00:42:04.026]  Perhaps at the end of the show we'll play a clip of him choking him up close.
[00:42:04.527 --> 00:42:07.948]  But Thomas Woods, author of Meltdown, is on with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:42:12.025 --> 00:42:14.367]  We appreciate him coming on the show.
[00:42:14.927 --> 00:42:18.490]  He is a senior fellow with the Lubbock-Von Mies Institute with Ron Paul.
[00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:24.115]  He holds a bachelor's degree in history from Harvard and his master's and PhD from Columbia University.
[00:42:24.135 --> 00:42:35.644]  He's an author of nine books, including two New York Times bestsellers, Meltdown, A Free Market Look, and Why the Stock Market Collapsed, The Economy Tank, and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse, and The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History.
[00:42:36.707 --> 00:42:44.035]  So, he joins us right now, Thomas E. Woods, to give us his perspective on what's happening with the economy and where the government's taking us.
[00:42:44.315 --> 00:42:45.476]  Thanks for coming on, Mr. Woods.
[00:42:45.797 --> 00:42:46.277]  My pleasure.
[00:42:46.838 --> 00:42:47.138]  You bet.
[00:42:47.478 --> 00:42:51.443]  Okay, tell us from the Von Mies Austrian School angle.
[00:42:52.765 --> 00:42:54.787]  What's really happened here and where we're going?
[00:42:54.807 --> 00:43:00.153]  I think the only point of disagreement we may have is that I know this is engineered from the IMF World Bank documents.
[00:43:00.473 --> 00:43:05.358]  They implode things by design to then bring in even more control in the next phase of their Ponzi scheme.
[00:43:05.639 --> 00:43:11.565]  I don't know your view on that, but I do agree with you regardless that government's quote, making it worse for the common person.
[00:43:11.605 --> 00:43:11.965]  Go ahead.
[00:43:12.206 --> 00:43:15.169]  Well, there's certainly the case that regardless of where these
[00:43:16.563 --> 00:43:20.205]  I mean, I argue that it's what the Fed is doing to us.
[00:43:20.245 --> 00:43:22.606]  The Federal Reserve gives rise to these busts.
[00:43:23.106 --> 00:43:29.588]  The bottom line is that they always use the bust that they brought about as a pretext to get more power over us.
[00:43:29.688 --> 00:43:31.509]  It's a perverse dynamic.
[00:43:32.029 --> 00:43:43.294]  And unfortunately, we have so many people who are right now, because of Obama and his alleged charisma, we have people who are so zombified that they're just going to sit back and go along with what's being said.
[00:43:43.314 --> 00:43:45.895]  And I think it could not be more important.
[00:43:46.483 --> 00:43:59.950]  For people who believe in freedom and who actually believe in a real free economy, not a manipulated one, to be able to answer these people, to show that every single thing they're recommending would make things worse.
[00:44:00.031 --> 00:44:06.034]  All the fiscal stimulus nonsense, the monetary stimulus nonsense, printing up money, every one of these suggestions
[00:44:06.903 --> 00:44:20.664]  You could make a superficially plausible argument for, but if you get one millimeter beneath the surface, every bit of it makes us poorer and gives them pretext for still more power because they perpetuate the depression.
[00:44:21.986 --> 00:44:22.946]  Let's start with GM.
[00:44:22.966 --> 00:44:27.928]  Let's kind of start at the end, and then after the break, go back to the beginning of these monetary systems.
[00:44:28.709 --> 00:44:43.055]  $30 billion to give it to select globalist crony capitalism or monopoly capitalism, non-free market groups, to then give it to the Brazilians, give pieces to the Chinese and to the Russians and to the Europeans.
[00:44:43.515 --> 00:44:50.638]  Having it off where the President fires the CEO because he won't do it, hijacks it, and now it's confirmed in Congress, as I'm sure you know,
[00:44:51.158 --> 00:44:58.621]  That if you give Democratic donations to Democratic Congress people, they'll allow your GM dealership to stay open.
[00:44:58.701 --> 00:45:00.842]  If not, they grab it and give it to somebody else.
[00:45:01.122 --> 00:45:05.484]  So it's Chicago, big city machine robbing everybody.
[00:45:05.824 --> 00:45:09.666]  And that's, as you said, only one millimeter in to quote, saving GM.
[00:45:10.268 --> 00:45:10.869]  Absolutely.
[00:45:11.029 --> 00:45:15.173]  And meanwhile, we're being told that this is the last thing Obama wants to do.
[00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:16.434]  He doesn't want to run GM.
[00:45:16.594 --> 00:45:22.119]  So, you know, the usual, I think my usual rule of thumb is whatever they say, the opposite is true.
[00:45:22.199 --> 00:45:27.364]  So when he says he just absolutely hates the idea of running GM, you know, sorry, I guess I just don't buy that.
[00:45:27.404 --> 00:45:35.311]  But we're being told that eventually, don't worry, you know, the government is going to sell off its share of GM and return it to private hands and don't worry about it.
[00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:47.075]  After however long they're going to have it, I don't know, a year, two years, who knows how long, and they mismanage it inevitably, they use it as a big pork barrel thing, who would want to buy it?
[00:45:47.135 --> 00:45:49.235]  I mean, they're going to run the thing even further into the ground.
[00:45:49.535 --> 00:45:50.516]  Who are they going to sell it to?
[00:45:50.776 --> 00:45:54.297]  So they're going to wind up having it forever, as far as I can see.
[00:45:54.844 --> 00:46:00.888]  Well, I mean, having the skeleton, it's kind of like they've eaten all the meat off the turkey and there's bones laying there.
[00:46:00.968 --> 00:46:14.157]  They're giving it to little select cronies, you know, big pieces of it, and then making us finance, kind of like a new IMF World Bank boondoggle, but through the vehicle of GM.
[00:46:14.897 --> 00:46:19.962]  And it's worth noting that, you know, GM is obviously not the only bankruptcy we've had going on.
[00:46:19.982 --> 00:46:25.646]  We've had major, major bankruptcies of major chains, everything from Lennon's and things to Circuit City.
[00:46:26.107 --> 00:46:33.393]  And the rule is that if you can't get financing to keep your operation running during the bankruptcy proceedings, then you've got to liquidate, and that's the end of it.
[00:46:33.933 --> 00:46:38.517]  So, Circuit City and Lennon's and things, a lot of these companies couldn't get that financing, so they liquidated.
[00:46:38.917 --> 00:46:39.997]  Stay there, we got a break.
[00:46:40.457 --> 00:46:43.798]  And then now on top of it, they're saying they're going to bail out the media.
[00:46:44.098 --> 00:46:45.479]  That means merging with the government.
[00:46:45.499 --> 00:46:52.700]  ABC News is announcing they're getting fully behind socialized health care and will now become an organ officially of the White House.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.421]  That's a headline at InfoWars.com.
[00:46:54.781 --> 00:46:57.402]  We've got the author Thomas Woods on ThomasWoods.com.
[00:46:57.682 --> 00:46:58.682]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:47:02.153 --> 00:47:12.460]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:18.844]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:47:19.324 --> 00:47:21.946]  Starve or surrender.
[00:47:22.787 --> 00:47:27.650]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.750]  What then?
[00:47:30.527 --> 00:47:33.369]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:37.771]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:47:37.911 --> 00:47:40.793]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:47:40.873 --> 00:47:47.916]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[00:47:48.116 --> 00:47:49.897]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:47:50.018 --> 00:47:55.420]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.421]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:48:01.403 --> 00:48:06.636]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:48:07.436 --> 00:48:12.781]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:48:13.301 --> 00:48:19.506]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:48:19.806 --> 00:48:21.628]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:48:21.788 --> 00:48:24.170]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:35.139]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:48:37.418 --> 00:48:38.678]  It's not about left or right.

[00:50:54.002 --> 00:50:55.262]  TomWoods.com is the website.
[00:51:07.102 --> 00:51:10.028]  He is a New York Times bestselling author of multiple books.
[00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:16.780]  Meltdown, a free market look at why the stock market collapsed, the economy tanked, and government bailouts will make things worse.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:17.822]  Okay, I'm going to try to sit back.
[00:51:19.019 --> 00:51:21.120]  One of the fellows at the Von Mies Institute with Ron Paul.
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:30.362]  I want to sit back and let you break it down from your perspective, but I just want to throw out, what do you think of this hoax of Newsweek and others saying that we're all socialists now and that this is socialism?
[00:51:30.842 --> 00:51:35.423]  Socialism I think is bad enough, but supposedly some of the stolen money goes to the poor.
[00:51:36.003 --> 00:51:42.005]  This is offshore corporations looting us and sanguinating us and sucking us dry.
[00:51:43.686 --> 00:51:46.228]  I mean, this is not socialism we're seeing.
[00:51:46.268 --> 00:51:50.991]  Isn't this just highway robbery or piracy that's going on, sir?
[00:51:51.211 --> 00:51:54.954]  Yeah, I mean, it seems to me that I wouldn't even want to dignify it with a word.
[00:51:55.014 --> 00:51:59.657]  I mean, other than looting or whatever, there's no economic philosophy behind it.
[00:52:00.998 --> 00:52:07.380]  Whatever economic rationale they try to put forth for it, it's just a cover for polluting the population in broad daylight.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:16.542]  And they must really get a good laugh out of how easy it is, how they're getting away with it, and how they've got the media in their pockets that just echoes all the rationales.
[00:52:16.962 --> 00:52:26.785]  Like, for instance, we hear things like systemic risk, that, oh, you know, we've got to bail out these bankers because, you know, heaven knows if one of these institutions failed, then the others would fail, and then we'd all be
[00:52:27.185 --> 00:52:40.128]  Reduced to crawling around eating worms, but in fact, gosh, there was an article two or three years ago in something called the Journal of Financial Economics that went through all these arguments and concluded that this whole systemic risk thing is totally overblown.
[00:52:40.168 --> 00:52:42.969]  That the actual systemic risk is about zero.
[00:52:43.009 --> 00:52:49.270]  This is basically just a convenient pretext for politicians when they're shoveling money to their friends.
[00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:52.851]  They can cover it by saying, oh, no, no, no, I'm just acting for the common good.
[00:52:52.911 --> 00:52:54.912]  I'm acting for you people to maintain the system.
[00:52:55.292 --> 00:52:55.832]  Oh, come on!
[00:52:56.761 --> 00:53:03.286]  Meanwhile, the 10-year notes going up, mortgage rates are going up in reality.
[00:53:03.326 --> 00:53:04.907]  They can cut rates down to zero.
[00:53:05.007 --> 00:53:06.168]  Reality's setting in.
[00:53:07.028 --> 00:53:12.372]  They're saying, other economists, I don't know what your views are, saying we're at 18, 19% real employment.
[00:53:12.893 --> 00:53:14.634]  I mean, how long can this charade go on?
[00:53:15.785 --> 00:53:18.449]  Well, I'm surprised it's gone on as long as it has, but you're right.
[00:53:18.489 --> 00:53:26.039]  I mean, I think your unemployment statistics are far more accurate than the phony baloney ones cooked up by the government that they've been manipulating for years.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:32.328]  If you really compare our situation with the 1970s and you compute the unemployment statistics the way they did,
[00:53:32.989 --> 00:53:51.091]  We're already at or above 20% because one of the things they did, I'm sure you already know this, is in the 80s and 90s they got rid of the discouraged worker, which means if you've been looking for a job and you're looking and looking and you just figure this is totally hopeless and you just stop, you figure it's not even worth bothering, they don't count you as being unemployed.
[00:53:51.542 --> 00:53:58.747]  So the millions of people that moved in with mommy and daddy, or parents that moved in with their kids, or homeless people, they just don't count us.
[00:53:58.927 --> 00:53:59.808]  No, they don't count them.
[00:53:59.848 --> 00:54:09.996]  So in other words, when you're hearing that the official statistic has it at 9.4% unemployment, you can believe the reality is at least double that.
[00:54:10.016 --> 00:54:12.377]  And it doesn't factor in all the part-time workers.
[00:54:12.718 --> 00:54:16.981]  And so it is essential for us to get where this comes from.
[00:54:17.081 --> 00:54:18.622]  Why does this happen to us?
[00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:25.024]  Because, of course, we're being told that, well, it just goes to show that when your overlords aren't running everything, this is what happens.
[00:54:25.144 --> 00:54:27.065]  And you stupid rubes didn't listen to us.
[00:54:27.425 --> 00:54:29.986]  That whole thing is becoming the conventional wisdom.
[00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:30.686]  Exactly!
[00:54:30.726 --> 00:54:33.147]  They're saying you need bigger overlords.
[00:54:33.227 --> 00:54:36.088]  That will fix it when it's the very overlords that did it!
[00:54:36.468 --> 00:54:46.119]  And it was so funny when the German Chancellor Merkel said, you know, it's like when they occasionally say something sensible, they have to immediately follow it up with something disastrous.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.284]  So she said, you know, gee, you know, the central banks have really done a rotten job.
[00:54:50.324 --> 00:54:51.265]  Hey, great so far.
[00:54:51.285 --> 00:54:56.131]  And then she goes on to say, therefore, we need to have a giant coordination of all the central banks.
[00:54:56.591 --> 00:54:56.871]  No!
[00:54:56.891 --> 00:54:59.412]  That's the exact opposite direction we want to go in.
[00:54:59.652 --> 00:55:01.652]  We should be wanting to shut these things down.
[00:55:02.653 --> 00:55:15.036]  It is they, and this is what Austrian theory teaches, it's what Hayek won the Nobel Prize for, it is they who get the economy hopped up on these unsustainable booms that then ruin people's lives when the bust comes.
[00:55:15.356 --> 00:55:24.524]  But during the boom, we're all told that, hey, this prosperity is going to go on forever, everybody should get into the stock market, and everybody starts thinking that, you know, you can get rich quick through all this.
[00:55:24.584 --> 00:55:27.446]  And meanwhile, you wind up getting wiped out.
[00:55:27.767 --> 00:55:31.270]  And it's about time Americans realized this is not the free market looting you.
[00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:35.333]  It is Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke and his friends.
[00:55:35.453 --> 00:55:38.556]  And, you know, when Alan Greenspan said earlier this year, he said, you know,
[00:55:39.237 --> 00:55:42.248]  I guess there's a flaw in the free market that I hadn't noticed before.
[00:55:42.629 --> 00:55:43.553]  Yeah, you know what, Alan?
[00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:45.279]  We have met the flaw, and it is you.
[00:55:46.345 --> 00:55:48.067]  Well, exactly, and he knows what he's doing.
[00:55:48.087 --> 00:55:49.508]  It's problem, reaction, solution.
[00:55:49.548 --> 00:55:50.670]  They create the crisis.
[00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:52.291]  Now everybody's freaking out.
[00:55:52.552 --> 00:56:08.588]  The public's ignorant about economics, so they're believing the guys in suits, and Bernanke says he'll fix it with accelerating the old model, a new bank of the world that we'll pay our carbon taxes to, and they're going to jack up world taxes and not let there be these
[00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:21.788]  These cash sinks, these tax avoidance countries, and the bankers, they're openly announcing a bank of the world, world government, run by the same parasites.
[00:56:23.959 --> 00:56:25.259]  Yes, long segment coming up.
[00:56:25.279 --> 00:56:27.220]  We kind of have our brakes all stacked up together there.

[00:56:43.766 --> 00:56:46.207]  And how worse we'll discuss on the other side.
[00:56:46.607 --> 00:56:47.547]  They're going for broke.

[00:58:06.122 --> 00:58:07.303]  Inner Health Botanicals.

[00:58:11.705 --> 00:58:13.266]  My wife just loves the stuff.

[00:59:07.909 --> 00:59:14.194]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[00:59:14.414 --> 00:59:15.474]  Have a glass of water.
[00:59:15.975 --> 00:59:21.319]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?

[00:59:47.858 --> 00:59:48.179]  I think so.
[01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:20.852]  Coming up next, our open phones and suspects turn table on NYPD with video.
[01:00:21.272 --> 01:00:25.313]  They had hidden cameras as the police tried to plant drugs on them.
[01:00:26.253 --> 01:00:28.873]  You see, we're using Big Brother's tools against Big Brother.
[01:00:29.414 --> 01:00:33.294]  We're going to document everything we're talking about as this rotten criminal government is exposed.
[01:00:33.634 --> 01:00:40.836]  Going back to our guest here in one moment, I want to tell you about one of our new sponsors first here, ladies and gentlemen, and that's Front Sight.
[01:00:41.696 --> 01:00:49.000]  The website is FRONTSITE, like a gun site, FRONTSITE.COM, F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.741]  Listen, it's very simple.
[01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:58.865]  This is the number one private firearms training system in the country.
[01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:02.922]  And they have systems you can get from a distance, or you can go there and take the training.
[01:01:03.422 --> 01:01:05.923]  And everybody I knew ten years ago was taking this.
[01:01:06.203 --> 01:01:07.044]  Police I know.
[01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:09.545]  I used to do shooting competition.
[01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:12.286]  I didn't get into it deep, but I did some of it.
[01:01:12.306 --> 01:01:17.147]  The point is, they were all on the front site, and this is better than the law enforcement military training.
[01:01:17.167 --> 01:01:26.311]  In fact, they send the police and people there to get Dr. Ignatius Piazza's training, the founder of Frontside Firearms Training Institute.
[01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:31.872]  So he's offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[01:01:32.912 --> 01:01:33.192]  Okay?
[01:01:34.133 --> 01:01:40.374]  He's offering five days of firearms training to my listeners and it comes along with a 30-stake concealed weapons permit.
[01:01:41.474 --> 01:01:48.076]  So just find out about the deal and how you get a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:01:48.776 --> 01:01:50.156]  That's FrontSight.com.
[01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:53.397]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:01:53.857 --> 01:01:56.358]  And when he contacted me and I found out he was a listener,
[01:01:57.961 --> 01:02:03.825]  Because, I mean, really, this is the premier private firearms training and it's in a non-boot camp type atmosphere.
[01:02:03.925 --> 01:02:05.126]  I was really flattered.
[01:02:06.247 --> 01:02:12.892]  And then he's the first of the time offer, this free offer for a free handgun, and basically the course at half price.
[01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:15.173]  Just check him out at FrontSight.com.
[01:02:17.597 --> 01:02:28.225]  Also to support us in the radio show, what we're doing, don't forget InfoWars.com, the online video and bookstore shopping cart, lots of new books and videos we're adding there, and of course my film, The Obama Deception.
[01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:34.589]  Lots of discounts on Patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and meet like-minded people, like the answer to 1984 or 1776.
[01:02:34.629 --> 01:02:41.554]  I keep getting emails from new listeners going, you're always talking about 1984 and you're always talking about 1776.
[01:02:42.315 --> 01:02:42.875]  What is that?
[01:02:42.935 --> 01:02:45.837]  So I've emailed a few back, though I don't have time, and I say,
[01:02:46.818 --> 01:02:47.478]  Are you joking?
[01:02:47.498 --> 01:02:50.199]  And they email back and say, no.
[01:02:50.259 --> 01:02:53.000]  And I go, 1776 is the Declaration of Independence against tyranny.
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.081]  The true flower of the Renaissance.
[01:02:56.361 --> 01:02:56.701]  Okay?
[01:02:57.161 --> 01:02:59.942]  And 1984 is the opposite of that, tyranny.
[01:03:00.322 --> 01:03:04.344]  So we're in a 1984 society, the answer is 1776.
[01:03:06.644 --> 01:03:09.645]  Anyways, that's why this show is here, so people learn basic stuff like that.
[01:03:09.945 --> 01:03:11.786]  I'm not on some high horse either, I'm an average guy.
[01:03:12.126 --> 01:03:14.747]  Now let's go to somebody who isn't an average guy, Thomas E. Woods.
[01:03:16.039 --> 01:03:21.242]  And economist, researcher, historian, and we appreciate him coming on the show.
[01:03:21.262 --> 01:03:22.743]  He's with the Ludwig von Mies Institute.
[01:03:23.104 --> 01:03:24.444]  Okay, continuing, sir.
[01:03:24.504 --> 01:03:32.770]  I've gotten to the point of the new Bank of the World, Financial Times of London, and now for world government, ruled by the very George Soros pirates.
[01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:39.214]  Please continue and go through the facts, proving for people that don't know that government is making it worse.
[01:03:39.834 --> 01:03:40.975]  Well, there's no question about it.
[01:03:41.015 --> 01:03:43.196]  I mean, the short version is that
[01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:48.143]  To some extent, we can say the Fed is a private institution.
[01:03:48.164 --> 01:03:49.004]  That's all well and good.
[01:03:49.064 --> 01:03:57.790]  But as a private institution, it would be in big trouble if it didn't have the monopoly power the government gave it to create all the money it wants to out of thin air.
[01:03:58.731 --> 01:04:02.834]  Governments and central banks always have incestuous relationships with each other.
[01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:04.916]  And this one works both ways.
[01:04:05.496 --> 01:04:06.457]  And it's the Fed
[01:04:07.037 --> 01:04:16.543]  That basically gave us this boom by forcing interest rates really low, getting the economy on a boom that it couldn't sustain in the long run, and bidding up housing prices.
[01:04:16.563 --> 01:04:25.808]  We wouldn't have had this housing bubble, the bursting of which has ruined so many people's lives, if we hadn't insisted on having a Soviet commissar running our money and interest rates.
[01:04:25.848 --> 01:04:30.491]  Because what would have happened is if you and I had just started buying a lot of houses just as a hobby or something,
[01:04:31.071 --> 01:04:37.013]  On a free market, the banks would have run out of money to lend to us and interest rates would have shot up, and that would have put an end to all this speculation.
[01:04:37.053 --> 01:04:40.774]  We wouldn't have had people buying five investment properties and having no job.
[01:04:41.194 --> 01:04:51.217]  But when you have the Alan Greenspan figure, the great maestro, and he can create all the money he wants, well, he can give the banks even more to lend and keep this artificial boom going.
[01:04:51.573 --> 01:04:54.055]  And they didn't stop there, they then packaged the crud.
[01:04:54.215 --> 01:04:55.756]  We'll explain that later, but go ahead.
[01:04:55.856 --> 01:05:10.308]  Yeah, then they packaged the crud, sell it all over the world, and they, meanwhile, all their experts, the Fed economists, even Ben Bernanke himself was saying, no, there's no housing bubble, these prices are sustainable, they're real, go ahead, you should have an adjustable rate mortgage, you should do all these things.
[01:05:10.328 --> 01:05:10.889]  It's wonderful.
[01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:13.451]  I mean, and so people did, understandably.
[01:05:13.691 --> 01:05:17.934]  And they flipped houses and people thought they could make a living simply by living in a house.
[01:05:18.174 --> 01:05:20.016]  There's something wrong with that, that you could think.
[01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:22.639]  That by sitting here in my house, I'm going to get wealthy.
[01:05:22.999 --> 01:05:26.243]  But it feeds into this sort of get-rich-quick sort of mentality.
[01:05:26.343 --> 01:05:27.524]  It's delusion, is it not?
[01:05:27.584 --> 01:05:28.305]  Mass delusion?
[01:05:28.665 --> 01:05:29.727]  It absolutely was.
[01:05:29.827 --> 01:05:31.208]  And so it just fed on itself.
[01:05:31.268 --> 01:05:33.471]  And eventually, inevitably, this has to crash.
[01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:35.453]  There are only so many $900,000 houses people are prepared to buy.
[01:05:37.675 --> 01:05:50.123]  So this is entirely a Federal Reserve System engineered boom and bust, and then we just read just today that now the Fed is going to be given even more powers over American businesses in the future.
[01:05:50.163 --> 01:05:58.309]  So again, as usual, the lesson is, no matter how much you screw up, the solution is we're going to give you more power, no matter what happens.
[01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:59.169]  That is always the thing.
[01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:02.211]  Well, Tom, here's a question, and then you can continue with your expert breakdown.
[01:06:02.332 --> 01:06:02.532]  Sure.
[01:06:03.508 --> 01:06:08.369]  The issue is even Senator Byrd, the fossil, is saying these czars are unconstitutional.
[01:06:08.749 --> 01:06:22.292]  It's unconstitutional to announce that the TSA is going to be in every major city running checkpoints on the road and on bus terminals and trains, and to have the president grab GM and fire the CEO.
[01:06:22.352 --> 01:06:25.452]  I mean, I can't even believe it's getting this crazy.
[01:06:25.532 --> 01:06:26.613]  What's coming next?
[01:06:26.713 --> 01:06:28.553]  I mean, it's all completely illegal.
[01:06:29.693 --> 01:06:33.094]  Well, I think they're being encouraged by the fact that they take these risks.
[01:06:33.134 --> 01:06:41.957]  They say, you know what, we're going to see what the American population does if we take over the car companies, or if we fire the CEO, or if we put checkpoints everywhere.
[01:06:42.357 --> 01:06:46.598]  And, you know, by and large, I do think the number of people who are resisting this is growing.
[01:06:47.098 --> 01:06:50.079]  But it's not growing fast enough, and it can't grow fast enough.
[01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:55.941]  And so I think they're being encouraged to do more to go faster than I think they imagined they could get away with at this point.
[01:06:56.325 --> 01:06:56.946]  Well, that's it!
[01:06:57.046 --> 01:07:12.162]  I mean, they're announcing North Com and the Army Times is ready to quote, shoot Americans and that the Army's new job is worrying about veterans and gun owners and DHS reports and everything's getting crazed and the news admits that Texas police everywhere are just robbing old ladies of their wallets.
[01:07:12.222 --> 01:07:14.844]  I mean, it's really becoming Twilight Zone.
[01:07:15.145 --> 01:07:18.909]  I mean, how much crazier do you think it'll get?
[01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:22.296]  Well, I mean, I'm surprised it got this crazy.
[01:07:22.316 --> 01:07:24.417]  So I think it's very hard to put an upper bound on it.
[01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:41.745]  But what most irritates me is the idea that people who question something like the Fed, which you would think a normal society would question, if one guy can create trillions of dollars and then blow it and not even have to tell us where it's going, you would think a normal society would question that.
[01:07:42.066 --> 01:07:46.888]  But you're considered to be off-the-wall crazy if you want to know what's going on with all this money.
[01:07:47.328 --> 01:07:50.310]  But you would think that would be the normal reaction.
[01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:57.936]  And I get told a lot on the radio that, since I favor abolishing the Fed, that I'm just throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
[01:07:58.356 --> 01:08:01.078]  Well, guilty as charged, because it's a demon baby!
[01:08:01.098 --> 01:08:04.200]  You know, I want the bathwater, the whole tub, out of here!
[01:08:05.538 --> 01:08:06.078]  Exactly.
[01:08:06.158 --> 01:08:08.099]  It's the demon baby that created all this.
[01:08:08.239 --> 01:08:08.719]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:08:08.799 --> 01:08:09.719]  It created all this.
[01:08:10.499 --> 01:08:11.920]  It makes the wars possible.
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:16.621]  It is the central funder of the empire.
[01:08:16.681 --> 01:08:18.662]  It is the lifeblood of the empire.
[01:08:19.102 --> 01:08:22.923]  And it is, at the same time, as I say, it is the author of the booms and busts.
[01:08:23.303 --> 01:08:29.011]  And it is also the institution that, in effect, encourages all this crazy, risky behavior.
[01:08:29.051 --> 01:08:39.046]  Because the major Wall Street firms, they know, and they have known for a long time, and especially during Greenspan's tenure, that if things really get bad for the major Wall Street actors,
[01:08:39.686 --> 01:08:44.310]  Alan Greenspan or whoever the Fed Chairman happens to be at the time will bail you out, because he has the power to do it.
[01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:45.131]  He can do it.
[01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:46.953]  He can create the money to bail you out.
[01:08:47.273 --> 01:08:48.814]  So why should we be surprised?
[01:08:48.854 --> 01:08:54.560]  We have no right to be surprised if Wall Street begins to get drunk, as George W. Bush said.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:55.921]  Well, why shouldn't they?
[01:08:56.041 --> 01:09:00.385]  You know, I mean, they've got a safe ride home, sitting right in the room.
[01:09:00.485 --> 01:09:01.686]  You know, why shouldn't they get drunk?
[01:09:01.826 --> 01:09:02.866]  Yeah, they're validated.
[01:09:02.907 --> 01:09:04.667]  They're encouraged to loot and steal.
[01:09:05.067 --> 01:09:16.373]  Meanwhile, you make a $1,000 mistake on your income tax that the money's paid to the private federal reserve, and three years later it's $15,000 in penalties and interest, and there's no judge or jury, no court for you.
[01:09:16.473 --> 01:09:18.714]  We're held to this super high standard.
[01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:23.657]  And I'm seeing the delusion in government, not just in the corporate world, intensify.
[01:09:24.177 --> 01:09:27.900]  They really believe the craziness that they're engaged in.
[01:09:29.321 --> 01:09:32.303]  How do you see this unfolding market-wise?
[01:09:32.323 --> 01:09:34.364]  I mean, I keep asking the same question.
[01:09:34.405 --> 01:09:38.848]  How much further can this go historically when it finally does shake out?
[01:09:39.228 --> 01:09:40.109]  Where are we going to be?
[01:09:40.169 --> 01:09:41.930]  What is it going to look like when the dust settles?
[01:09:42.628 --> 01:09:53.731]  Well, I mean, I think if they continue on the path they're on, I think this will be prolonged, it'll be worse than what happened in Japan, and I see no reason that they won't continue on this path.
[01:09:53.771 --> 01:09:59.052]  Obama, the other day, when they were telling him, hey, the economy's still in the toilet, you know, what do you think about that?
[01:09:59.152 --> 01:10:02.253]  He said, well, don't worry, we've got more stimulus money coming down the pipeline.
[01:10:02.293 --> 01:10:04.694]  So he never thinks, nor do any of them ever think,
[01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:08.095]  That the problem is we've had too much of a destructive policy.
[01:10:08.135 --> 01:10:09.656]  It's always that we haven't had enough of it.
[01:10:09.696 --> 01:10:10.737]  We've got to just keep doing it.
[01:10:11.217 --> 01:10:15.519]  And one of the points I make in Meltdown is this totally forgotten episode in American history.
[01:10:15.919 --> 01:10:18.200]  Nobody remembers there was a depression in the year 1920.
[01:10:18.901 --> 01:10:24.683]  And the reason we don't remember it is that the Fed was still so young it hardly even knew how to operate yet.
[01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:26.924]  It wasn't doing open market operations.
[01:10:26.944 --> 01:10:27.985]  The Fed stayed out of it.
[01:10:28.485 --> 01:10:34.050]  The federal budget was cut in half in two years, and the result was you had a very quick, robust recovery.
[01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:36.032]  Now, that's the exact opposite of what we're told today.
[01:10:36.072 --> 01:10:42.458]  We're told today the government needs to get more power, needs to spend more money, it needs to inflate, needs to do all this stuff, because otherwise we'll have a disaster.
[01:10:42.498 --> 01:10:43.299]  Well, to the contrary!
[01:10:43.499 --> 01:10:51.447]  The one time we had a chance to do the opposite of this, we were out of it before you know it, but meanwhile they are doing the very opposite.
[01:10:51.927 --> 01:10:52.788]  Of what makes sense.
[01:10:52.868 --> 01:10:59.974]  And they're doing exactly the same things that have now given Japan, in the last quarter annualized, Japan's economy shrank by over 15%.
[01:11:00.614 --> 01:11:03.817]  I mean, you expect to hear that out of Haiti or Zimbabwe.
[01:11:04.017 --> 01:11:04.777]  This is Japan!
[01:11:05.058 --> 01:11:08.620]  And they've done everything that Geithner and all the so-called experts tell them to do.
[01:11:08.981 --> 01:11:12.463]  It is long past time we dispense with these so-called experts.
[01:11:12.523 --> 01:11:14.205]  We not feel intimidated by these people.
[01:11:14.245 --> 01:11:15.266]  These are morons.
[01:11:15.946 --> 01:11:20.750]  When it comes to economics, we should have confidence that if you just sit down and
[01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:27.436]  One thing I'm good at, I mean, I'm bad at a lot of things, but one thing I'm good at is explaining this stuff so the average person can get it.
[01:11:27.496 --> 01:11:33.922]  And a lot of people read Meltdown and they say, you know, I understand this so clearly now, why is it impossible for these people to get it?
[01:11:34.182 --> 01:11:36.564]  And then, of course, that leads to a deeper question.
[01:11:37.011 --> 01:11:38.292]  Well, Tom, we know why.
[01:11:38.612 --> 01:11:40.073]  They're crazy like a fox.
[01:11:40.473 --> 01:11:41.834]  There's a method to the madness.
[01:11:42.434 --> 01:11:44.816]  I've read the IMF World Bank documents, as I'm sure you have.
[01:11:45.376 --> 01:11:46.457]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[01:11:46.517 --> 01:11:47.678]  They give us all the risk.
[01:11:47.718 --> 01:11:48.598]  They get all the profit.
[01:11:49.399 --> 01:11:53.722]  And they love wrecking economies, you know, controlled command destruction.
[01:11:54.662 --> 01:11:57.425]  And it was great for the oligarchs in Russia when everything fell apart there.
[01:11:57.465 --> 01:11:58.266]  They got great power.
[01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:00.208]  It's great for these oligarchs.
[01:12:01.008 --> 01:12:03.451]  And it's like George Soros said, I'm having a great crisis.
[01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:03.951]  I love it.
[01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:05.913]  This is the culmination of my life.
[01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:06.814]  Close quote.
[01:12:07.835 --> 01:12:09.036]  They know what they're doing.
[01:12:09.056 --> 01:12:11.559]  And as everything implodes, then all we've got is government.
[01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:13.120]  It becomes the central pillar.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.822]  And so I want you to speak to that.
[01:12:14.862 --> 01:12:15.482]  But then also,
[01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:18.305]  There's two schools of thought and solution.
[01:12:18.885 --> 01:12:20.226]  I believe in the Austrian school.
[01:12:20.386 --> 01:12:21.027]  I know you're right.
[01:12:21.067 --> 01:12:21.808]  I've studied the history.
[01:12:22.328 --> 01:12:40.283]  But we're already so far down the road of big government and crony capitalism, monopoly capitalism, that if we're going to have $14.8 trillion pumped out in the last seven months, if that would have gone to big work projects and to things on the main street, real economy, it'd still be a big debt and inflation and the wrong way to go.
[01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:57.635]  But it'd be a lot better than pumping it offshore to speculators to then buy barges of oil and park it off of islands in the Mediterranean, as JP Morgan's doing, to then jack up gas prices artificially so we then pay a tax to them on that.
[01:12:57.995 --> 01:13:03.879]  I sure know that if we're going to have $14.7 trillion, and it's our money, a fiat currency, I mean,
[01:13:04.619 --> 01:13:07.782]  Bloomberg reported all the mortgages in the country were $9.5 trillion.
[01:13:08.142 --> 01:13:10.804]  With this $14 trillion, we could have paid off all our mortgages.
[01:13:10.844 --> 01:13:19.231]  I mean, I think that's the message to the little socialists, the little blue-collar people that don't understand this, that, hey, they took your money offshore.
[01:13:19.251 --> 01:13:20.152]  Now, go ahead.
[01:13:20.592 --> 01:13:31.516]  Well, I mean, and of course then we have the additional problem that with a lot of this money that, you know, has apparently been created or spent or who knows what, we actually don't even know the exact recipients.
[01:13:31.957 --> 01:13:34.378]  I'm sure you saw the video a couple months ago.
[01:13:34.478 --> 01:13:41.100]  It was a Democratic representative from Florida questioning the laughably titled Inspector General at the Fed.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.622]  I mean, talk about an absurd title, Inspector General, like there's any inspecting going on.
[01:13:45.882 --> 01:13:48.483]  And he asked her, can you account for some of these trillions?
[01:13:48.503 --> 01:13:53.524]  I mean, we're just kind of wondering if you could just give us the exact recipients, who got what, what collateral was accepted.
[01:13:53.784 --> 01:13:55.105]  She didn't even understand the question.
[01:13:55.965 --> 01:14:14.410]  And one of the most, I think, rewarding moments, I mean, just really, really just joy-producing moments of my life in recent years, is the realization that there are people out there who understand what's going on with the Fed, and that now it's almost like all the cool people are anti-Fed, you know?
[01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:15.350]  I mean, now everybody wants to
[01:14:16.311 --> 01:14:17.071]  Exactly.
[01:14:17.271 --> 01:14:27.079]  Once the veneer of invincibility dissipates, and once Ron Paul started calling out Bernanke and Senator Sanders, I'm sure you've seen the clip where Sanders says, Bernanke, where's the money?
[01:14:27.139 --> 01:14:29.741]  And Bernanke says, I'm not going to tell you.
[01:14:30.601 --> 01:14:40.650]  I mean, as much as we are inclined to fall into despair and think, well, everything's shot, it absolutely isn't, because there is a lot that an enraged populace can do.
[01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:49.057]  And if this crisis really continues to snowball and really barrels out of control, there's no group that can control an economy that totally collapses.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.862]  Anything can happen if it's a situation like that.
[01:14:55.102 --> 01:14:58.045]  But in the short run, people are starting to ask some good questions.
[01:14:58.105 --> 01:15:02.029]  And we might even get, or at least we might even get an audit of the Fed.
[01:15:02.049 --> 01:15:07.014]  And as Ron Paul puts it, no matter how that debate turns out, it is a victory.
[01:15:07.054 --> 01:15:08.635]  Because if we get the audit, then great.
[01:15:08.936 --> 01:15:12.419]  But if they veto this bill, well, in a way, that's also good.
[01:15:12.499 --> 01:15:15.121]  Because then, that just encourages more suspicion.
[01:15:15.141 --> 01:15:17.804]  People are going to say, wait a minute, what are you hiding?
[01:15:18.344 --> 01:15:18.745]  Exactly.
[01:15:18.785 --> 01:15:19.886]  No, no, that's even better.
[01:15:19.966 --> 01:15:30.417]  I mean, we're trying to pass it with everything we've got, but if they cover it up, right as we get to the trunk that's stinking to high heaven, we're looking for the dead body, and the guy's got blood on his hands, I mean, yeah, exactly.
[01:15:30.457 --> 01:15:33.020]  Then everybody starts asking, why are you so secretive?
[01:15:34.215 --> 01:15:39.637]  And meanwhile, to me, the amazing thing is, here we've got a supposedly free press.
[01:15:39.697 --> 01:15:42.778]  I'm sure you know all about this, but we've got a supposedly free press.
[01:15:42.978 --> 01:15:47.639]  They have a chance, the media, to interview Ben freaking Bernanke on 60 Minutes.
[01:15:47.899 --> 01:15:51.120]  So you'll think, oh, here will be some really great investigative journalism, right?
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:57.323]  Well, instead, the reporter walks into the Fed building and he looks around and he says, ooh, wow, they don't build buildings like this anymore.
[01:15:57.343 --> 01:16:00.085]  I mean, total lapdog, pathetic loser.
[01:16:00.465 --> 01:16:05.548]  And then instead of asking Bernanke, well, let's see, everything you've said has been wrong for the last three years.
[01:16:05.588 --> 01:16:09.890]  You told us there was no housing bubble, the mortgage market was great, things were going to turn around.
[01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:13.232]  Like, every single thing you've said is wrong, so why would we want to listen to you now?
[01:16:13.572 --> 01:16:17.374]  Instead, the questions were like, gee, what's your biggest concern?
[01:16:17.394 --> 01:16:19.735]  You know, so it was like Katie Couric interviewing Hillary
[01:16:20.427 --> 01:16:21.808]  Oh, you care about us?
[01:16:21.868 --> 01:16:23.509]  Tell us how you're trying to save us.
[01:16:23.529 --> 01:16:25.030]  You need more power?
[01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:26.311]  We've been bad?
[01:16:50.827 --> 01:16:52.829]  Well, that's another issue.
[01:16:52.969 --> 01:16:55.171]  Obama cannot talk without his teleprompter.
[01:16:55.191 --> 01:16:57.153]  Look at you, running a million miles an hour.
[01:16:57.173 --> 01:16:58.213]  I am Ron Paul.
[01:16:58.594 --> 01:17:00.515]  All of us that love liberty, we can talk.
[01:17:00.595 --> 01:17:01.937]  We got our facts and history.
[01:17:02.237 --> 01:17:12.045]  And when you really talk to Bernanke and others, and I've been around them, I've confronted them and others, they are themselves these little tight, little, you know, cards close to the chest.
[01:17:12.305 --> 01:17:13.726]  They won't answer any questions.
[01:17:14.066 --> 01:17:18.370]  I mean, it's really just a big, stinking edifice that needs to come down.
[01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:25.419]  Absolutely, and I mean imagine, now thankfully there is alternative media that is of course popping up everywhere, that's wonderful.
[01:17:25.939 --> 01:17:34.751]  If we had in the mainstream media, if we had one-tenth of the investigative instinct, just think of how different a country would be.
[01:17:36.075 --> 01:17:41.719]  But the private Federal Reserve funds all the big mega-corporations that own the media and the military-industrial complex.
[01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:48.403]  So, when 60 Minutes was literally guarding its financial emperor, who it works for.
[01:17:48.924 --> 01:17:52.806]  So there is no impartial, impartiality there.
[01:17:53.287 --> 01:17:58.170]  And let's talk about the media bailout, where the government's going to fund the newspapers and TV.
[01:17:58.670 --> 01:17:59.771]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:02.975]  Spring is here.
[01:18:03.215 --> 01:18:03.995]  Growing season.
[01:18:04.175 --> 01:18:06.156]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:18:06.377 --> 01:18:07.777]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:18:08.098 --> 01:18:08.758]  Think about it.
[01:18:09.058 --> 01:18:12.920]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:18:13.161 --> 01:18:16.623]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:18:16.843 --> 01:18:19.404]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:18:19.684 --> 01:18:30.691]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family
[01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:31.171]  Let's do it!
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:01.882]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:02.062 --> 01:19:07.047]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[01:19:07.448 --> 01:19:09.530]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[01:19:09.871 --> 01:19:19.081]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[01:19:19.341 --> 01:19:26.085]  This program has already settled over $100 million of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.
[01:19:26.406 --> 01:19:32.549]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments, the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[01:19:32.729 --> 01:19:34.190]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.192]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.
[01:19:40.054 --> 01:19:40.634]  Let's do it!
[01:20:00.649 --> 01:20:03.030]  Are you concerned for the safety of your loved ones?
[01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:06.492]  Listen closely to this message from Pepperspray.com.
[01:20:06.953 --> 01:20:09.794]  Every 22 seconds a violent crime is committed.
[01:20:10.095 --> 01:20:14.217]  America has changed and your personal safety is your first priority.
[01:20:14.517 --> 01:20:15.137]  Be smart.
[01:20:15.338 --> 01:20:15.938]  Be safe.
[01:20:16.298 --> 01:20:16.718]  We're good to go.
[01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:46.579]  I think so.
[01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:17.992]  I just want to take a few seconds out to thank all the listeners.
[01:21:20.613 --> 01:21:26.916]  Unlike the government, we don't come and forcibly take your money and then use it against you.
[01:21:28.878 --> 01:21:31.199]  We don't come and forcibly take your money and give it to private corporations.
[01:21:31.239 --> 01:21:38.443]  We ask you to buy the books and videos and materials at InfoWars.com so we can operate it against the big corporate media that uses your tax money against you.
[01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:41.752]  And we have the once-a-year money bomb.
[01:21:41.812 --> 01:21:45.896]  Second annual raised $280,000 and a little bit more still coming in.
[01:21:45.916 --> 01:21:49.580]  And that will really help us expand everything we're doing and I commend all of you.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.161]  God bless you.
[01:21:50.361 --> 01:21:53.164]  You're going to see big changes in the next year like you've seen in the last.
[01:21:54.125 --> 01:21:57.549]  We're going to have our guest with us five minutes to the next hour so I can play a two-minute clip.
[01:21:57.869 --> 01:22:00.052]  The clip he mentioned where the Solicitor General
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:06.285]  The private Federal Reserve has asked where the trillions go, and she says, I don't know, which of course isn't true.
[01:22:07.026 --> 01:22:16.576]  But now we're openly not just seeing the government spend tens of billions a year for fake newscasts, buying reporters, these news packages that were secret.
[01:22:17.037 --> 01:22:19.940]  Now they're openly saying they're going to bail out the media.
[01:22:20.321 --> 01:22:23.224]  I mean, how about a bailout for the taxpayers, sir?
[01:22:24.725 --> 01:22:25.286]  Well, exactly.
[01:22:25.306 --> 01:22:33.958]  I mean, particularly on this media question, how in the world could you possibly have a free media when they know they might have a chance to get a bailout?
[01:22:33.978 --> 01:22:38.444]  Who's going to want to criticize the government now if you know money could be coming if you shut up and toe the line?
[01:22:39.385 --> 01:22:42.209]  It's unbelievable that anyone could conceivably support this.
[01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:45.386]  Alright, I've asked all my questions.
[01:22:46.047 --> 01:22:47.968]  I know there's a lot of other points that are important.
[01:22:48.268 --> 01:22:55.514]  What are other areas, because you've got the evidence there and in your book, of where they do things that make the economy worse?
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.962]  Well, let me just first make a quick comment about the Inspector General of the Fed, the clip that you've got there.
[01:23:01.462 --> 01:23:10.786]  I think this, if you actually watch this woman, she genuinely, either she should win an Academy Award, or she genuinely doesn't understand this stuff.
[01:23:11.226 --> 01:23:17.189]  Whatever the case is, either she's a liar or ignorant, it shows an unbelievable contempt for the public.
[01:23:17.249 --> 01:23:21.711]  It really shows the Fed's total contempt that they would produce this woman.
[01:23:22.051 --> 01:23:26.636]  Who can't answer a single question or refuses to answer even the simplest sort of question.
[01:23:26.656 --> 01:23:27.697]  It's just astonishing.
[01:23:28.198 --> 01:23:34.004]  But my argument of one of my points in Meltdown, and incidentally while we're on the media question,
[01:23:34.824 --> 01:23:36.666]  Meltdown's got a forward by Ron Paul.
[01:23:36.706 --> 01:23:41.590]  The only person in a hundred miles of Washington with any credibility on this is the New York Times bestseller for ten weeks.
[01:23:41.811 --> 01:23:47.896]  The New York Times, my publisher tells me, has refused to review it, even though it is customary for them to review bestsellers.
[01:23:47.916 --> 01:23:49.858]  The book calls out the Fed and all this stuff.
[01:23:50.118 --> 01:23:51.720]  Anybody can get it, so they won't review it.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.467]  The last time, the only other time they did review a book of mine, was the Politically Incorrect Guide to American History, and I'm sure they realized that after they condemned it,
[01:24:00.087 --> 01:24:03.609]  Everybody bought it, so needless to say, they can't mention it at all.
[01:24:03.989 --> 01:24:08.172]  But the New York Times, without some type of bailout, is clearly going down.
[01:24:08.312 --> 01:24:12.134]  I mean, they're going to need some type of bailout, and I hope it never comes.
[01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:16.216]  It couldn't be more richly deserved.
[01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:23.380]  But one of my arguments, and it's not exclusive to me, is that the very existence of the Fed, the very fact that you have one,
[01:24:24.301 --> 01:24:26.122]  Increases what we call moral hazard.
[01:24:26.142 --> 01:24:29.284]  In other words, it makes people do riskier things than they otherwise would do.
[01:24:29.664 --> 01:24:36.768]  And in particular, ever since especially the late 90s, when there was a hedge fund called Long-Term Capital Management.
[01:24:36.988 --> 01:24:37.849]  That's a bad name.
[01:24:37.889 --> 01:24:40.831]  You would not want this hedge fund managing your long-term capital.
[01:24:40.891 --> 01:24:45.073]  But anyway, Alan Greenspan bailed this thing out when things went sour.
[01:24:45.233 --> 01:24:48.475]  Now, that was the mathematic geniuses that were invincible.
[01:24:48.775 --> 01:24:49.015]  Yeah.
[01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:51.876]  Oh yeah, so absolutely invincible, and then bang!
[01:24:52.176 --> 01:24:53.877]  The economy gave its verdict.
[01:24:54.177 --> 01:24:57.458]  Well, after he did that, of course, what did that make Lehman do?
[01:24:57.518 --> 01:24:58.858]  What did that make Merrill Lynch do?
[01:24:58.918 --> 01:24:59.158]  All of it.
[01:24:59.198 --> 01:25:00.899]  Made him ten times more reckless.
[01:25:00.959 --> 01:25:01.319]  Exactly.
[01:25:01.359 --> 01:25:01.999]  So I mean, what?
[01:25:02.539 --> 01:25:05.100]  Again, and then meanwhile, this is all blamed on the free market.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:14.183]  No, we should blame it on the fact that we've got this monopolistic entity that is... And again, there is this sort of superstition that the Fed is there for the common person.
[01:25:14.947 --> 01:25:15.207]  Come on!
[01:25:16.148 --> 01:25:17.809]  It's there to bail out the big guys.
[01:25:17.889 --> 01:25:18.710]  That's why it's there.
[01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:20.592]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:25:20.632 --> 01:25:21.612]  Final segment with our guest.
[01:25:21.632 --> 01:25:28.178]  We're going to come back and just play a minute or two of him asking her and she's just bumbling around and can't answer anything.
[01:25:28.198 --> 01:25:32.461]  You'll hear a bunch of this weird corporate doublespeak about, is there a review of this?
[01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:36.144]  And that's coming up in one minute as we start the final hour.
[01:25:36.724 --> 01:25:37.245]  Stay with us.
[01:25:42.048 --> 01:25:43.850]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:25:50.531 --> 01:25:55.535]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:25:55.735 --> 01:25:59.539]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:25:59.759 --> 01:26:05.364]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:26:05.665 --> 01:26:10.529]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:11.250]  Number three,
[01:26:11.650 --> 01:26:17.095]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:26:17.936 --> 01:26:20.599]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:26:20.839 --> 01:26:25.043]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:26:25.363 --> 01:26:28.967]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:26:29.207 --> 01:26:34.692]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:26:34.932 --> 01:26:39.495]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:27:10.794 --> 01:27:19.580]  By the way, I have gotten so obsessed with the North Korea situation and Iran, and I forgot to get to our top story today like a fool the last three hours.
[01:27:20.971 --> 01:27:21.471]  The D.O.D.
[01:27:21.511 --> 01:27:25.974]  training manual describes protest, all protest, as low-level terrorism.
[01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:31.016]  And the Army's declassified documents that I am watched by the U.S.
[01:27:31.196 --> 01:27:32.897]  Army at my events.
[01:27:33.257 --> 01:27:34.298]  And so is Ron Paul.
[01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:36.899]  And Ron Paul just kind of nicely shrugs it off.
[01:27:37.559 --> 01:27:38.720]  But that's coming up.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:39.820]  We have these in the Fed rallies.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.901]  They have Army intelligence there.
[01:27:41.961 --> 01:27:43.642]  New breaking mainstream news.
[01:27:43.662 --> 01:27:44.383]  We'll cover that.
[01:27:45.103 --> 01:27:51.746]  And we've got just a few minutes left with Tom Woods, TomWoods.com, the Ludwig von Mies Institute bestselling author.
[01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:54.608]  But let's go ahead and play just a minute or two of this clip.
[01:27:54.628 --> 01:28:00.571]  This is the Selector General, the investigator of the Fed investigating itself, bumbling around.
[01:28:00.611 --> 01:28:01.071]  Here it is.
[01:28:03.372 --> 01:28:05.253]  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
[01:28:06.774 --> 01:28:10.036]  Inspector Coleman, you're the Inspector General for the Federal Reserve, right?
[01:28:11.516 --> 01:28:12.197]  That's correct.
[01:28:12.697 --> 01:28:21.943]  Have you done any investigations concerning the Federal Reserve's role in deciding not to save Lehman Brothers, which led to shockwaves that went through the entire financial system?
[01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:26.206]  In that particular area?
[01:28:26.407 --> 01:28:33.131]  You know, I don't generally comment on specific investigations, but we do not currently have an investigation in that particular area.
[01:28:34.292 --> 01:28:34.512]  All right.
[01:28:34.832 --> 01:28:41.257]  What about the $1 trillion-plus in expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet since last September?
[01:28:41.823 --> 01:28:44.265]  Have you conducted any investigations regarding that?
[01:28:46.067 --> 01:28:56.035]  Right now we have a, we call it a review, and I don't know if the term investigation may have different connotations.
[01:28:56.375 --> 01:29:07.785]  So we're actually conducting a fairly high-level review of the various lending facilities collectively, which would include, you know, the TALF, a variety of the different programs that are in process.
[01:29:07.805 --> 01:29:10.107]  So we're looking at them at a fairly high level to identify risk.
[01:29:11.007 --> 01:29:15.849]  Well, I understand that, but we're talking about events that started unfolding eight months ago.
[01:29:15.929 --> 01:29:22.531]  Have you reached any conclusions about the Fed expanding its balance sheet by over a trillion dollars since last September?
[01:29:22.931 --> 01:29:24.512]  We have not yet reached any conclusions.
[01:29:24.872 --> 01:29:29.634]  Do you know who received that money?
[01:29:31.275 --> 01:29:34.056]  We're in the process right now of doing our review.
[01:29:36.286 --> 01:29:37.767]  Right, but you're the Inspector General.
[01:29:38.307 --> 01:29:46.391]  My question to you specifically is, do you know who received that $1 trillion plus that the Fed extended and put on its balance sheets since last September?
[01:29:46.411 --> 01:29:47.932]  Do you know the identity of the recipients?
[01:29:48.492 --> 01:29:48.992]  I do not know.
[01:29:49.033 --> 01:29:51.474]  We have not looked at that specific area.
[01:29:52.474 --> 01:29:54.335]  At this particular point on those reviews.
[01:29:57.157 --> 01:30:03.560]  What about Bloomberg's report that there are trillions of dollars in off-balance sheets transactions
[01:30:04.281 --> 01:30:07.423]  that the Federal Reserve has entered into since last September.
[01:30:08.103 --> 01:30:10.684]  Are you familiar with those off-balance sheet transactions?
[01:30:12.345 --> 01:30:19.729]  I think it may be important at this point, too, just to bring up a certain aspect related to our jurisdiction.
[01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:22.691]  Let's just go ahead and go back.
[01:30:22.931 --> 01:30:26.793]  The Inspector General has no jurisdiction over who the Fed's giving money to.
[01:30:26.873 --> 01:30:30.095]  In closing, Mr. Woods, your comments on what you just heard.
[01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:39.564]  Well, when my wife showed this to me the other night, and I know there are a lot of us who would kill to have a wife who digs out anti-Fed videos, and I'm telling you, I got one.
[01:30:39.924 --> 01:30:45.648]  And when I heard this thing, I thought, this is the best video in favor of auditing the Fed I've ever seen.
[01:30:45.928 --> 01:30:49.270]  It's almost like, you know, it's almost like I made it, even if she's an actress.
[01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:50.671]  It is astonishing.
[01:30:52.092 --> 01:30:59.234]  That, as I say, either she's ignorant or she is sinister, but this is the person they put out when they know we've got serious questions.
[01:30:59.274 --> 01:31:03.115]  Well, my view is the party is starting to end.
[01:31:04.295 --> 01:31:10.437]  It's been almost a century for the Fed, but people are starting to cotton on to it and it has not happened a moment too soon for me.
[01:31:11.024 --> 01:31:12.025]  So it's not going to live to 100.
[01:31:14.148 --> 01:31:19.876]  It's 97, 98 years old right now, and it's time to fell this rotten tree that's endangering the entire house.
[01:31:20.157 --> 01:31:20.878]  I'd love to do it.
[01:31:20.898 --> 01:31:23.521]  I don't know if we'll do it in time for 100 years.
[01:31:23.541 --> 01:31:26.145]  I don't know when it'll happen, but I do think it will happen.
[01:31:26.624 --> 01:31:27.124]  Well, I hope.
[01:31:27.384 --> 01:31:28.385]  It's getting long in the tooth.
[01:31:28.405 --> 01:31:29.725]  This parasite needs to be removed.
[01:31:30.025 --> 01:31:32.666]  It's like a two-pound tick on a one-pound dog.
[01:31:33.146 --> 01:31:33.686]  Meltdown.
[01:31:33.726 --> 01:31:35.887]  A free market look at why the stock market collapsed.
[01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:36.647]  The economy tanked.
[01:31:36.687 --> 01:31:38.527]  The government bailouts will make things worse.
[01:31:38.567 --> 01:31:40.008]  I look forward to talking to you again, sir.
[01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:41.108]  Amazing interview.
[01:31:41.188 --> 01:31:42.468]  TomWoods.com.
[01:31:42.749 --> 01:31:44.089]  Tom, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:31:45.612 --> 01:31:46.514]  Amazing having him on.
[01:31:46.714 --> 01:31:47.395]  Very informative.
[01:31:47.736 --> 01:31:51.622]  So there, that's the answer to all you out there that think we need to have more government as a solution.
[01:31:52.304 --> 01:31:53.425]  Now, I agree with Tarpley.
[01:31:53.445 --> 01:31:55.729]  If we're going to have trillions spent, might as well give it to the people.
[01:31:56.230 --> 01:31:57.332]  But that's not going to happen.
[01:31:58.274 --> 01:31:58.915]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:00.558 --> 01:32:02.139]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:06.820]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.721]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:32:09.922 --> 01:32:12.783]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:32:12.983 --> 01:32:18.825]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:32:19.065 --> 01:32:21.986]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:32:22.286 --> 01:32:29.189]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:34:08.389 --> 01:34:09.209]  Chemtrails.
[01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:11.210]  The modified atmosphere.
[01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:13.490]  Heavy metals and pesticides.
[01:34:13.971 --> 01:34:17.712]  Carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[01:34:18.567 --> 01:34:21.069]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.

[01:35:05.812 --> 01:35:08.112]  Because there's a war on for your mind!
[01:35:19.027 --> 01:35:36.734]  Alright, for one segment, and I appreciate him joining us, I'm going to have to open the phone and cover all the other news, and believe me, it's crazy.
[01:35:37.715 --> 01:35:39.475]  Very important information coming up.
[01:35:39.535 --> 01:35:40.276]  Gregory Hoover
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:44.302]  Hoover vs. Beck.com is the website.
[01:35:44.382 --> 01:35:50.785]  HooverBigFatV vs. Beck.com is the website.
[01:35:50.805 --> 01:35:52.386]  His email address is hoovervsbeck.com.
[01:35:52.506 --> 01:35:57.529]  And he's suing Beck and Fox staff for defaming of character
[01:35:58.726 --> 01:36:03.267]  Regarding Beck's remarks linking 9-11 truthers with James Von Braun.
[01:36:03.627 --> 01:36:05.067]  Yeah, this guy's linked to the government.
[01:36:05.127 --> 01:36:09.008]  We've been to the National Press Club over the weekend and yesterday.
[01:36:09.028 --> 01:36:09.948]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:36:10.288 --> 01:36:13.509]  We're in contact with reporters, confirming leads we got here.
[01:36:13.569 --> 01:36:14.789]  We sent people to D.C.
[01:36:15.289 --> 01:36:18.670]  for this and had them do an interview with other people while they were on it.
[01:36:21.291 --> 01:36:23.271]  Wayne Madsen, but separate from Wayne Madsen.
[01:36:23.951 --> 01:36:24.791]  And we're working on it.
[01:36:24.871 --> 01:36:27.052]  We want to be careful before we release something like this.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.401]  But no, as usual, it's the FBI.
[01:36:31.161 --> 01:36:32.141]  They're good ol' boy around.
[01:36:32.181 --> 01:36:41.745]  Remember that 1992 video of them lynching blacks in effigy, and thousands of FBI and BATF agents selling N-word hunting licenses?
[01:36:42.745 --> 01:36:45.626]  You'd think they're just infiltrating white supremacists, but it's more than that.
[01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:47.107]  They are the white supremacists.
[01:36:47.147 --> 01:36:50.388]  It's very... And they work for a bunch of weird ADL people.
[01:36:50.728 --> 01:36:54.069]  It's so bizarre when you get to the highest rungs of the New World Order,
[01:36:55.503 --> 01:37:08.543]  Well, it's like the Jewish Congress mainline news in the Ottawa Citizen, the big Ottawa newspaper, the capital city newspaper reporting what we already knew started the Nazi party in 65.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:18.383]  In Canada, and the London Guardian reports, the modern Nazi party in 69 was founded in Germany by the German security services.
[01:37:18.663 --> 01:37:21.064]  They don't go out and infiltrate the groups.
[01:37:21.124 --> 01:37:21.864]  They run them.
[01:37:21.904 --> 01:37:22.785]  They are them.
[01:37:22.805 --> 01:37:27.226]  I mean, it's just... And you find out it's not just to infiltrate white supremacists.
[01:37:27.286 --> 01:37:28.127]  They are!
[01:37:30.968 --> 01:37:31.768]  Who would ever imagine?
[01:37:31.788 --> 01:37:33.148]  It's so crazy!
[01:37:33.549 --> 01:37:36.890]  Truth is always so much crazier than you can even imagine.
[01:37:38.609 --> 01:37:43.853]  But how does the ADL, how does the Southern Poverty Law Center, how do they survive if they don't have Nazis?
[01:37:45.375 --> 01:37:46.135]  Oh, it's very sick.
[01:37:47.036 --> 01:37:47.596]  It's very sick.
[01:37:47.616 --> 01:37:50.339]  That's why I'm hated by the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center and the Nazis.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:58.846]  Well, I mean, look, they give Arnold Awards for worshipping Hitler, saying he wants to be like Hitler and, you know, wants to be a dictator.
[01:37:58.866 --> 01:37:59.847]  But side issue,
[01:38:02.213 --> 01:38:14.963]  Greg Hoover is going to be suing the above-described defendants in federal court for Beck's having repeatedly broadcast statements characterizing those who question government official version 9-11 as anarchists, terrorists, and persons denying the Holocaust.
[01:38:14.983 --> 01:38:16.524]  He said before, he used the Army on us.
[01:38:16.965 --> 01:38:29.054]  The complaint will note that on October 22, 2007, Beck suggested that those identifying themselves or associated with the 9-11 treatment movement are dangerous anarchists who deny the Holocaust and are the kind of group the Timothy McVeigh would come from.
[01:38:29.895 --> 01:38:34.760]  The suit will also note that Beck, during the June 10th broadcast, linked the murder of the D.C.
[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:37.442]  Holocaust Museum garb at 9-11 Truthers with no evidence.
[01:38:38.764 --> 01:38:45.730]  As he's previously written, suing people for defamation who falsely claim that 9-11 activists are terrorists could be a good way to stand up to these bullies.
[01:38:46.618 --> 01:38:53.661]  Yeah, you don't see the Southern Poverty Law Center when I link them with federal documents to running the white supremacist compound that McVeigh came out of at L.A.
[01:38:53.681 --> 01:38:53.982]  City.
[01:38:54.442 --> 01:38:55.562]  You don't see him coming after me.
[01:38:55.803 --> 01:38:57.663]  Go ahead, come after me, you've already done it.
[01:38:58.504 --> 01:39:06.628]  Behind the scenes, when some nut kills cops, you go look at his computer, thousands of sites he's visited, you find out he didn't like me and was attacking me.
[01:39:08.362 --> 01:39:10.866]  And then you feed that to the news media.
[01:39:11.568 --> 01:39:13.631]  See folks, they know I know.
[01:39:13.972 --> 01:39:14.653]  But it's too late!
[01:39:14.673 --> 01:39:16.596]  You're going to shut down the Ottawa Citizen?
[01:39:17.979 --> 01:39:20.203]  You're going to shut down CNN reporting on it now?
[01:39:22.217 --> 01:39:24.058]  Oh, the big secret's out!
[01:39:24.979 --> 01:39:25.139]  Oh!
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:27.141]  And the Miami Herald?
[01:39:28.082 --> 01:39:31.985]  About how the top Nazi rallies are run by the FBI?
[01:39:32.605 --> 01:39:33.606]  Run by you!
[01:39:34.367 --> 01:39:35.027]  I've had it!
[01:39:35.708 --> 01:39:38.410]  You want our First Amendment and you're not getting it!
[01:39:40.011 --> 01:39:41.172]  I'm calling you out!
[01:39:42.514 --> 01:39:43.174]  You're sick!
[01:39:43.554 --> 01:39:45.076]  Stop your Nazi activity!
[01:39:45.396 --> 01:39:48.779]  Stop spreading racism and then acting like you're trying to clean it up and fix it!
[01:39:49.773 --> 01:39:51.674]  We don't want to be at each other's throats anymore.
[01:39:51.694 --> 01:39:53.496]  We don't want to play your game anymore.
[01:39:53.716 --> 01:39:55.357]  We want to take down the New World Order.
[01:39:55.717 --> 01:40:03.242]  Stop trying to hang the name Jew on everything, too, to make people come after Jews, so then the ADL can sit there and suck off of them with donations.
[01:40:03.603 --> 01:40:04.803]  We know how you work!
[01:40:05.804 --> 01:40:10.227]  And Meche and La Raza saying, for our race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.
[01:40:10.607 --> 01:40:10.928]  U.S.
[01:40:10.968 --> 01:40:11.828]  government funded.
[01:40:12.369 --> 01:40:14.230]  Funding every racist group out there.
[01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:15.431]  We're sick of you!
[01:40:17.318 --> 01:40:19.839]  We know your game plan, and we're calling it out!
[01:40:21.159 --> 01:40:25.241]  And all you idiot Nazis that follow these groups, you need to stop doing what you're doing.
[01:40:25.261 --> 01:40:26.081]  You're a bunch of fools.
[01:40:26.101 --> 01:40:29.242]  Alright, I'm going to stop right there.
[01:40:29.282 --> 01:40:30.843]  Let's go to Gregory Hoover.
[01:40:30.863 --> 01:40:32.063]  Gregory, I may hold you over a little bit.
[01:40:32.083 --> 01:40:33.083]  I'm sorry I went into a rant.
[01:40:33.503 --> 01:40:39.606]  So, you're suing Lord Beck for saying we're violent terrorists, which is dangerous for us.
[01:40:39.866 --> 01:40:45.508]  How about sue Michael Reagan saying murder 9-11 truthers?
[01:40:45.548 --> 01:40:46.688]  I mean, that's what's really dangerous.
[01:40:47.722 --> 01:40:49.723]  Well, that's a good point, Alex.
[01:40:49.783 --> 01:40:52.285]  I want to thank you first for having me on the show today.
[01:40:53.245 --> 01:41:04.292]  And there's good reason to lay suit to libel and defamation, in my opinion, on many of the media that are involved in this, I think.
[01:41:05.312 --> 01:41:06.673]  Conspiracy itself.
[01:41:06.773 --> 01:41:08.294]  Smear campaign, yeah.
[01:41:08.354 --> 01:41:09.475]  Conspiracy to defame.
[01:41:09.735 --> 01:41:12.636]  Yeah, anyone that's associated with the 9-11 movement.
[01:41:13.797 --> 01:41:21.722]  We're now at a present point in this process of exposure as to the government's involvement in these activities.
[01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:35.732]  That desperate attempts are being made to try to cause the general public to disassociate themselves with anyone who is attempting to try to pass along this overabundance, this wealth of information.
[01:41:35.752 --> 01:41:40.755]  I would imagine the feds are setting up child molesters for 9-11 Truth right now or something.
[01:41:40.775 --> 01:41:41.396]  It's not going to work.
[01:41:42.031 --> 01:42:03.607]  Well, they're really stretching it, and I think it gets to the point of it being ridiculously incredible that they would have, along with Beck on his program of June 10th here this past week, a claimed ex-CIA agent to put out this misinformation as to the association of 9-11
[01:42:05.003 --> 01:42:08.245]  Yeah, as if that supposedly gives it authoritative seal.
[01:42:08.625 --> 01:42:15.850]  As if that, that totally, the CIA's not supposed to be involved in our internal politics, and now they're running radio ads everywhere.
[01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:16.470]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:42:16.710 --> 01:42:20.433]  Well, yeah, I mean, first of all, it begs the question of why he's a former agent.
[01:42:20.733 --> 01:42:23.334]  It doesn't look as if he's a retirement agent.
[01:42:23.454 --> 01:42:33.781]  It seems to me that, you know, it exposes what a plant, I believe at this point, Glenn Beck is, and continues to be in the media mainstream.
[01:42:34.665 --> 01:42:44.466]  It's a great concern with me that he's now gotten to the point that he will so blatantly defame persons associated with the 9-1-1.
[01:42:45.956 --> 01:42:48.118]  Well, Greg, I think you have a right to do this.
[01:42:49.779 --> 01:42:59.065]  I mean, I just don't... I'm afraid it could turn him into a hero and he'll say, the Nazis are suing me, but then I guess you have an even bigger lawsuit against him.
[01:42:59.566 --> 01:43:05.430]  They'll just put another CIA guy in, but I mean, maybe that'll at least make them think twice next time.
[01:43:05.450 --> 01:43:06.871]  I mean, I lean towards your suit.
[01:43:07.191 --> 01:43:10.694]  I think it has some standing, but you seem like a pretty well-educated guy.
[01:43:10.734 --> 01:43:12.535]  I mean, why are you suing?
[01:43:12.575 --> 01:43:13.716]  Why do you think you have grounds?
[01:43:15.077 --> 01:43:30.990]  I think that when it gets to the point that, if he attempts to argue against the factual basis for the movement with regard to the evidence which is now being put forth by 9-11 truthers, that's one thing.
[01:43:31.050 --> 01:43:39.257]  But when he attempts to categorize and group persons and associate them with hate speech, which I'm now pretty much considering him.
[01:43:39.867 --> 01:44:07.362]  uh... to to be provided here or to provide uh... that i think he's he's stepped over a line i think that i think that that at this point when uh... someone uh... such as himself uh... begin the campaign that is uh... so blatantly uh... targeting persons in specific groups uh... where where it you know we we have to be kind of back up a little bit and in recognizing that he's not going after individuals where
[01:44:07.921 --> 01:44:10.806]  Where typically, defamation cases might lie.
[01:44:11.247 --> 01:44:17.498]  Instead, he's formulating his own image or mischaracterizations of persons.
[01:44:19.327 --> 01:44:23.410]  Uh, who are associating, associating themselves with these organizations and associations.
[01:44:23.551 --> 01:44:42.626]  That's right, he's persecuting, he's persecuting a, what he sees as a minority group, like Hitler, with the Jews, I guess, with a demonization campaign, broad brush, with a powerful bully pulpit, and there would be grounds to sue if he said, all Native Americans support
[01:44:43.206 --> 01:44:48.251]  White supremacist and Al Qaeda, you better believe he'd be sued by Native American groups and probably lose.
[01:44:48.611 --> 01:44:55.378]  The test is, in the courts will 9-11 truth and the First Amendment be protected like a Native American group?
[01:44:55.898 --> 01:44:57.500]  I think that these groups certainly shall.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:06.608]  I think that we can very well now easily establish that there are individuals who can be and are, especially in a position like this,
[01:45:08.009 --> 01:45:17.294]  Personally damaged, I myself, during the course of business day or in personal relations, will pass along information relevant to the 9-11 movement.
[01:45:18.115 --> 01:45:28.240]  And I'm then, in a sense, publicly, and as well concerning my association, I'm involved in the Orlando We Are Change, the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:32.142]  My picture and name is listed on there publicly and openly.
[01:45:33.570 --> 01:45:34.711]  And you've now been defamed.
[01:45:34.751 --> 01:45:38.252]  You've now been connected to this lunatic Ron Maroon.
[01:45:49.969 --> 01:45:50.550]  Are you kidding?
[01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:57.798]  Every show... Listen, I was on a radio show this morning, a radio show last night, and I go on the shows and they ask me, are you with Von Broom?
[01:45:58.278 --> 01:45:59.299]  And I go, why do you say that?
[01:45:59.319 --> 01:46:00.941]  And they go, well, Glenn Beck, basically.
[01:46:01.602 --> 01:46:07.188]  And I have to sit there and explain to them how asinine it is and that Von Broom was a World War II vet.
[01:46:07.469 --> 01:46:10.011]  Does that mean all World War II vets shoot security guards?
[01:46:10.732 --> 01:46:12.295]  At Holocaust museums?
[01:46:12.355 --> 01:46:17.142]  But the credibility of a national news show with a CIA guy.
[01:46:17.182 --> 01:46:19.545]  He held it out there like we are.
[01:46:19.565 --> 01:46:21.288]  That we honor him.
[01:46:21.869 --> 01:46:24.473]  We bow down at night and pray to von Brun statues.
[01:46:24.972 --> 01:46:25.232]  Right.
[01:46:25.252 --> 01:46:36.655]  In his quote, in fact, from June 10th on that show, Bex, at least, he's stating, I quote, the information that we have at this point is that this guy, of course, he's referring to Von Braun, is a hero to the 9-11 Troopers movement.
[01:46:36.815 --> 01:46:44.217]  Now, there's nothing that he could have provided or would have been provided, and there's nothing by my research to suggest that that allegation can be upheld.
[01:46:44.797 --> 01:46:50.379]  And he continues back with it and runs on again with a quote, and I'll say he said,
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.420]  Stay there, stay there, but I want to get this right.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.101]  Is it Von Brun or Von Braun?
[01:46:55.742 --> 01:46:57.002]  I've got Von Brun, B-R-U-N.
[01:46:57.022 --> 01:46:58.343]  Yeah, yeah, that's what I think it is.
[01:46:58.383 --> 01:46:59.464]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[01:46:59.484 --> 01:46:59.924]  Stay with us.
[01:47:00.768 --> 01:47:07.589]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:47:07.890 --> 01:47:23.793]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:47:24.093 --> 01:47:29.257]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:47:29.477 --> 01:47:35.742]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:47:35.982 --> 01:47:39.625]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:47:39.885 --> 01:47:42.467]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:47:42.567 --> 01:47:47.931]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:47:48.251 --> 01:47:50.853]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:47:50.913 --> 01:47:53.114]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:47:53.134 --> 01:47:55.595]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:59.998]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:48:00.899 --> 01:48:02.299]  It is a big idea.
[01:48:02.319 --> 01:48:04.421]  A new world order.
[01:48:05.141 --> 01:48:09.704]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:48:10.024 --> 01:48:12.185]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:48:12.866 --> 01:48:15.007]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:48:15.635 --> 01:48:18.057]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:48:18.818 --> 01:48:26.143]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:48:29.166 --> 01:48:34.148]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:48:34.608 --> 01:48:38.069]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:48:38.469 --> 01:48:40.949]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:48:41.049 --> 01:48:42.190]  Most people have no idea.
[01:48:42.210 --> 01:48:42.950]  They're not after money.
[01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:44.070]  They have all the money they need.
[01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.991]  They're after power.
[01:48:45.251 --> 01:48:45.971]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:49:21.306 --> 01:49:26.848]  Who needs sugar-coated excuses when you can get the cold hard facts and proven investment leads you can't get anywhere else?

[01:49:59.699 --> 01:50:06.664]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:50:06.905 --> 01:50:11.208]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:50:11.468 --> 01:50:16.572]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:50:17.072 --> 01:50:24.178]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:50:24.618 --> 01:50:29.502]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:50:29.982 --> 01:50:35.426]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:50:35.807 --> 01:50:41.331]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:14.612]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[01:51:15.553 --> 01:51:19.636]  We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there.
[01:51:19.976 --> 01:51:23.019]  Time is kind, just let your bandage run.
[01:51:23.799 --> 01:51:27.182]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[01:51:27.782 --> 01:51:30.244]  Let it all hang out, cause we gotta run to big.
[01:51:30.324 --> 01:51:35.829]  The boys up there stickin' Atlanta, and there's beer in Texarkana.
[01:51:42.116 --> 01:51:48.557]  Alright, Gregory Hoover, HooverVSBeck.com, just put a VS for Hoover and Beck.
[01:51:49.357 --> 01:51:50.518]  Appreciate you spending time with us.
[01:51:50.598 --> 01:51:57.659]  Okay, so in closing, going out to break there, you're saying you're being persecuted, and clearly we are.
[01:51:58.179 --> 01:52:11.702]  Isn't it suspect that they kept saying we're white supremacists, we're going to attack, when none of that had happened for years, and he'd say, mark my words, I love America, I'm going to attack, it's going to happen, and then magically it happens.
[01:52:12.245 --> 01:52:20.414]  Well, this goes back to his other quote earlier in the same program where he said, one of the things that I've been warning about for a very, very long time are these 9-11 truthers.
[01:52:20.434 --> 01:52:27.082]  They've been waiting for an opportunity for something along these lines to occur, so that they attempt to try to penetrate 9-11.
[01:52:29.364 --> 01:52:37.731]  That 9-11 truthers and people and militias were working for the Muslims with anthrax and were going to kill 300,000.
[01:52:37.951 --> 01:52:42.635]  And he said, I've been warning you a long time about this unholy alliance.
[01:52:43.075 --> 01:52:45.877]  Let's turn to our resident, I mean, made up baloney.
[01:52:45.917 --> 01:52:46.298]  Go ahead.
[01:52:46.678 --> 01:53:02.766]  It's gotten to the point now that there's no stretch of the imagination too far for him to reach to attempt to try to clothe us in disparaging ways such that there will be an automatic warding off of those who might otherwise be attracted to the movement.
[01:53:03.126 --> 01:53:05.327]  That'd be like I said, don't watch Glenn Beck.
[01:53:05.767 --> 01:53:08.148]  Don't watch Glenn Beck because he's a child molester.
[01:53:08.168 --> 01:53:10.910]  I don't have any proof of that, I'm just saying it.
[01:53:10.930 --> 01:53:12.290]  That's not true, folks.
[01:53:12.330 --> 01:53:14.331]  I'm just using it as a hypothetical example.
[01:53:17.403 --> 01:53:23.571]  Yeah, but with him, he's really throwing that out there that we're basically Nazis, and then not saying it's not true.
[01:53:23.872 --> 01:53:26.756]  He's putting it out there to damage us.
[01:53:27.036 --> 01:53:28.218]  So where does this suit go?
[01:53:29.815 --> 01:53:39.402]  We're seeking this in this suit, among which I'm seeking a temporary and permanent injunction against his attempting to try to defame us along these group statuses.
[01:53:39.822 --> 01:53:51.751]  I'd like to attempt to try to provide an FTC guideline with regard to these sorts of statements and a standard that I think can benefit.
[01:53:52.451 --> 01:53:54.292]  Uh, defamation cases along these lines.
[01:53:54.912 --> 01:54:21.203]  I think one of the greatest things that can come of this is that the media attention that this case is now garnering is one which will be recognized not only by those who are already associated and familiar with the 9-11 movement, but by virtue of the fact that it will attach itself inherently to Glenn Beck and his followers, it's going to expose them to the information that they otherwise would otherwise be hidden from
[01:54:22.253 --> 01:54:24.098]  Now, you sound like a lawyer.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:25.381]  Are you a lawyer?
[01:54:25.662 --> 01:54:27.065]  No, actually, I'm a CLA.
[01:54:27.105 --> 01:54:29.311]  I've been in the legal profession 20 years.
[01:54:29.471 --> 01:54:30.835]  I write appellate briefs for attorneys.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:31.820]  Okay, good.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:33.682]  So basically you're the guy that does the work for the attorneys.
[01:54:34.422 --> 01:54:43.408]  When your high-powered attorney tells you that he's going to have that memorandum briefer, or what have you, prepared and filed tomorrow morning, I'm actually the guy working it out.
[01:54:43.568 --> 01:54:48.031]  I've worked for firms large and small for the last two decades.
[01:54:48.051 --> 01:54:56.357]  Well, a better analogy of what Beck's doing is, if there was a big bank robbery and a jail guard got shot, or a bank guard got shot, and then I went on the radio and said,
[01:54:57.625 --> 01:55:06.789]  You know, I don't have any proof of this, but we're getting evidence that Glenn Beck thought this guy that killed the bank guard was a hero.
[01:55:07.129 --> 01:55:16.813]  Glenn Beck would sue me, and rightfully so, because there's no connection to the bank robber and Glenn Beck.
[01:55:16.893 --> 01:55:18.194]  Absolutely.
[01:55:18.394 --> 01:55:26.538]  And something interesting, when you said that it would seem at this point, you'll notice on that broadcast on June 10th, if you'll run the tape, it's now all over.
[01:55:27.638 --> 01:55:29.439]  Okay, in closing, where does this go?
[01:55:29.459 --> 01:55:30.420]  Where does the suit go?
[01:55:48.232 --> 01:55:53.196]  This suit goes into the Middle District Federal Court and the Orlando Division.
[01:55:53.216 --> 01:55:56.859]  We're looking for a class action status, which I believe we'll be able to gain certification of.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:10.910]  We're looking at this point, we recognize of course we're going to be up against heavy legal opposition from the Fox team, so we're looking to put together what I'd consider the legal dream team, which is why I've put up the Hoover vs. Beck.com site.
[01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:14.233]  We're looking for donations to be able to support the effort.
[01:56:14.273 --> 01:56:15.594]  We think that during the course of
[01:56:15.974 --> 01:56:16.956]  We're good to go.
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:35.043]  Well, he is assaulting us with lies, trying to hurt us, and trying to defame our free speech.
[01:56:35.683 --> 01:56:39.365]  And I appreciate what you're doing, and we'll stand behind you and get reports as it unfolds.
[01:56:39.745 --> 01:56:41.747]  Gregory Hoover, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:56:41.927 --> 01:56:42.767]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:56:42.827 --> 01:56:43.948]  It's been an honor speaking with you.
[01:56:44.128 --> 01:56:44.888]  Honor to speak with you.
[01:56:44.908 --> 01:56:47.230]  We'll be right back with your calls and a ton of news.
[01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:48.531]  30 minutes left in transmission.
[01:56:48.851 --> 01:56:49.651]  Keep it locked in.
[01:56:50.852 --> 01:56:51.752]  We're on the march.
[01:56:52.233 --> 01:56:53.834]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:54.754 --> 01:56:57.456]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:00.319 --> 01:57:05.881]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:57:06.181 --> 01:57:07.342]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:57:07.482 --> 01:57:11.463]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:57:11.743 --> 01:57:13.304]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:57:13.604 --> 01:57:19.907]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:57:21.047 --> 01:57:23.608]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:57:23.929 --> 01:57:25.409]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:57:25.670 --> 01:57:28.431]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:57:28.671 --> 01:57:30.112]  And their formula really works.
[01:57:30.392 --> 01:57:32.933]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:57:33.194 --> 01:57:34.454]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:57:34.694 --> 01:57:39.057]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:57:39.457 --> 01:57:41.658]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:57:41.878 --> 01:57:44.139]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:46.101]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:57:46.441 --> 01:57:47.561]  Go to www.
[01:57:49.362 --> 01:57:51.764]  We're good to go.
[01:58:00.404 --> 01:58:05.430]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:58:05.630 --> 01:58:09.414]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:09.655 --> 01:58:15.261]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:58:15.561 --> 01:58:20.427]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:58:20.627 --> 01:58:21.128]  Number three,
[01:58:21.528 --> 01:58:26.971]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:58:27.832 --> 01:58:30.474]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:58:30.734 --> 01:58:34.136]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:58:35.237 --> 01:58:38.859]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:58:39.099 --> 01:58:44.582]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:58:44.822 --> 01:58:49.365]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:58:49.525 --> 01:58:51.066]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:58:51.286 --> 01:58:53.628]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[01:58:53.868 --> 01:58:56.509]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:03.963]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:59:04.103 --> 01:59:09.308]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:59:09.508 --> 01:59:14.273]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:59:14.473 --> 01:59:25.443]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:59:25.703 --> 01:59:31.270]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:37.538]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:59:37.698 --> 01:59:38.339]  What about you?
[01:59:38.559 --> 01:59:40.462]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:59:40.482 --> 01:59:43.145]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[02:00:07.014 --> 02:00:31.657]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell But I've been seen with Farrah I've never been with anything less than a nine So fine I've been on fire with Sally Field Gone fast with a girl named Bo But somehow they just don't end up as mine It's a death-defying life I lead
[02:00:32.526 --> 02:00:34.048]  I'd take my chances.
[02:00:34.588 --> 02:00:37.491]  I'd die for a living in the movies and TV.
[02:00:37.552 --> 02:00:48.984]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:55.721]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we got about 26 minutes left in World Wide Transmission.
[02:00:55.741 --> 02:00:57.961]  I'm going right to your phone calls here in about two minutes.
[02:00:58.382 --> 02:01:02.803]  But first, I wanted to let you know about some of the sponsors that have made this World Wide Transmission possible.
[02:01:03.223 --> 02:01:05.703]  One of them is SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:01:06.123 --> 02:01:07.804]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:01:08.284 --> 02:01:14.025]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow your endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[02:01:14.105 --> 02:01:16.125]  I say buy it and plant it and enjoy it.
[02:01:16.425 --> 02:01:18.386]  Still got time for a summer and fall garden.
[02:01:19.585 --> 02:01:21.208]  And stop eating all that GMO crap.
[02:01:21.268 --> 02:01:21.909]  It's just fun.
[02:01:21.929 --> 02:01:25.836]  You got little kids, they'll like planting a garden a lot more than they will playing...
[02:01:26.921 --> 02:01:29.402]  Devil's Spider-Man games or whatever it is they're doing.
[02:01:29.942 --> 02:01:31.843]  It's fun to go put in a garden, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:32.203 --> 02:01:33.123]  The government doesn't like it.
[02:01:33.163 --> 02:01:34.124]  It's another reason to do it.
[02:01:34.444 --> 02:01:35.904]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[02:01:36.244 --> 02:01:38.345]  The government's buying up all the big seed companies.
[02:01:38.405 --> 02:01:40.066]  Foreign companies are doing it, shutting them down.
[02:01:40.086 --> 02:01:44.467]  They're trying to make you have licenses to have non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds in Europe.
[02:01:44.847 --> 02:01:46.088]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:01:46.128 --> 02:01:47.128]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[02:01:47.148 --> 02:01:47.308]  877-327-0365.
[02:01:47.328 --> 02:01:47.388]  877-327-0365.
[02:01:47.448 --> 02:01:48.268]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[02:01:56.485 --> 02:02:02.069]  Another one of our fine sponsors is symbolized by Max the Little Orange Gorilla.
[02:02:02.209 --> 02:02:03.109]  Very good little creature.
[02:02:03.129 --> 02:02:08.673]  Now when you're on InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com, you will see Max the Orange Gorilla.
[02:02:10.011 --> 02:02:12.053]  From Alpha Centuries, he came with David Icke.
[02:02:12.794 --> 02:02:26.549]  And you can go to homegain.com and it's a free service and you can enter in your address or address of a house you're looking at and find out what realtors are seeing, the real market value, what they believe the real market value is.
[02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:28.771]  HomeGain.com.

[02:02:42.063 --> 02:02:42.964]  A lot of other functions.
[02:02:43.384 --> 02:02:43.905]  HomeGain.
[02:02:44.345 --> 02:02:46.107]  That's Home and Gain dot com.
[02:02:47.228 --> 02:02:49.009]  And lastly, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:51.521]  Something I believe firmly in.
[02:02:51.541 --> 02:03:00.064]  A lot of antibiotics and antivirals aren't working anymore, but there's something that medical doctors on this show have said they believe can certainly help.
[02:03:01.224 --> 02:03:05.425]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[02:03:05.485 --> 02:03:17.770]  I want you to go to SupernaturalSilver.com today, or visit their link on InfoWars.com to find out more about this incredible new developed system of silver compound.
[02:03:18.712 --> 02:03:19.935]  It's down to the nano size.
[02:03:20.356 --> 02:03:22.542]  The new silver solution is a natural antibiotic.
[02:03:23.442 --> 02:03:27.485]  It is clinically proven to kill viruses, germs, bacteria, and yeast safely.
[02:03:28.085 --> 02:03:33.069]  It is a new technology and has proven to be a formidable weapon against the bio-threats of today and tomorrow.
[02:03:33.569 --> 02:03:38.593]  The new silver solution gel has been shown to disinfect topically, keep the area sanitized for up to four hours.
[02:03:38.953 --> 02:03:45.118]  The new silver solution is a highly effective, potent nanoparticle solution that is lethal to bacteria, yeast, and viruses.
[02:03:45.418 --> 02:03:47.239]  Go to supernaturalsilver.com.
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:50.282]  That's supernaturalsilver.com today.
[02:03:51.192 --> 02:03:54.515]  And those sponsors I believe in and have made this show possible today.
[02:03:55.055 --> 02:03:57.418]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Illinois.
[02:03:57.918 --> 02:03:58.879]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:03:58.919 --> 02:03:59.519]  Thanks for holding.
[02:03:59.559 --> 02:03:59.880]  Welcome.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:01.421]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[02:04:01.501 --> 02:04:02.722]  It's a privilege to talk to you, sir.
[02:04:03.563 --> 02:04:05.925]  Hey, I just wanted to throw this out there real quick.
[02:04:06.285 --> 02:04:08.728]  I'm a 30-year-old business owner, successful business owner.
[02:04:08.748 --> 02:04:12.151]  I know that's going to drive the opponents of the truth movement crazy.
[02:04:12.171 --> 02:04:13.031]  You're now kind of then.
[02:04:13.051 --> 02:04:14.873]  Gun owner, conservative business owner.
[02:04:15.373 --> 02:04:16.454]  In fact, I forgot to get to it.
[02:04:16.494 --> 02:04:17.455]  Did you guys print that article?
[02:04:17.475 --> 02:04:18.136]  I forgot to print.
[02:04:19.016 --> 02:04:33.381]  The uh... the uh... my computer's all locked up the one about it's up on Infowars and PrisonPlanet.com sorry to interrupt I just want to get this out before I forget about how about how all protesters are listed in army documents as terrorists.
[02:04:33.421 --> 02:04:34.321]  It's terrorism!
[02:04:34.361 --> 02:04:35.122]  Freedom is terror!
[02:04:35.142 --> 02:04:35.642]  But go ahead.
[02:04:36.162 --> 02:04:36.902]  Guilty as charged.
[02:04:36.982 --> 02:04:38.483]  Hey, two points I wanted to make real quick.
[02:04:38.643 --> 02:04:41.244]  If you reported on it already then I apologize in advance.
[02:04:42.052 --> 02:04:49.848]  MSN.com is reporting that due to the civil unrest in Iran, five out of the six internet ports have been shut down by the Iranian government.
[02:04:50.329 --> 02:04:53.775]  And if people think that that can't happen here, all they do is flip a switch.
[02:04:54.264 --> 02:04:55.725]  Yeah, no, they're very childlike.
[02:04:55.745 --> 02:05:03.352]  You know, I make these videos warning people how they're going to shut the web down with the head of cybersecurity resigning and confirming what we already said years ago.
[02:05:03.712 --> 02:05:06.254]  People go, it's impossible to shut the web down.
[02:05:06.594 --> 02:05:08.536]  It's meant to survive a nuke attack.
[02:05:08.996 --> 02:05:09.917]  That's if the U.S.
[02:05:09.997 --> 02:05:11.378]  government wants to keep it on.
[02:05:11.438 --> 02:05:12.639]  But they own it and run it.
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:21.547]  And now they're even going in under the law and grabbing the private hubs and making them put in federal kill switches where everything goes through it on record.
[02:05:21.847 --> 02:05:22.948]  And yes, you're absolutely right.
[02:05:23.618 --> 02:05:25.019]  Hey, point number two real quick.
[02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:37.932]  I checked out one of your videos from about ten years ago, and with all the problems that the states are supposedly having in the government with budget deficits, do you think it's not time that we open up Freedom of Information Acts
[02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:43.265]  On the comprehensive annual financial report for all states and government to find out where the real money is at.
[02:05:43.305 --> 02:05:45.206]  Yeah, but I mean the four years, it's open.
[02:05:45.427 --> 02:05:49.470]  They admit to having a double set of books and that they shipped all the money offshore to the bankers.
[02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:50.271]  They don't even hide it.
[02:05:50.311 --> 02:05:51.572]  They go, look, we stole your money.
[02:05:52.013 --> 02:05:52.553]  You don't like it?
[02:05:52.593 --> 02:05:54.435]  I'll send my paramilitary troops to kill you.
[02:05:55.336 --> 02:05:57.978]  We have the SWAT teams ready to eat your guts and ask for seconds.
[02:05:58.839 --> 02:06:03.964]  Illinois is reporting that they need a $9 billion budget shortfall.
[02:06:04.417 --> 02:06:09.040]  That they have to make cuts on, but back in 2003, they had a $17 billion surplus.
[02:06:09.421 --> 02:06:11.082]  Well, you know, it's Illinois that started it.
[02:06:11.122 --> 02:06:16.445]  The mafia, back in the 20s, started having a double set of books and using the mayors.
[02:06:16.646 --> 02:06:20.208]  It's Chicago 1313 and Al Capone.
[02:06:20.909 --> 02:06:22.770]  And the mafia's like, God, we run the government now.
[02:06:23.210 --> 02:06:28.154]  So they set a double set of books and they would not fill the potholes and say, we need more taxes and then get them.
[02:06:29.194 --> 02:06:36.358]  And so the bankers, the Federal Reserve said, we'll just run a Chicago Mafia scam, and since then it's been adopted worldwide.
[02:06:36.819 --> 02:06:38.800]  Yeah, I know, it's unbelievable.
[02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:40.060]  I appreciate your call.
[02:06:40.441 --> 02:06:43.422]  Yeah, this is absolute scum we're talking about here.
[02:06:43.602 --> 02:06:45.183]  Craig in New Jersey.
[02:06:45.203 --> 02:06:46.524]  Go ahead, Craig.
[02:06:47.425 --> 02:06:48.525]  What's up, Alex?
[02:06:49.166 --> 02:06:52.688]  One thing, I'm just calling in to promote the all-new We Are Change New Jersey.org.
[02:06:53.806 --> 02:06:54.347]  A website.
[02:06:54.667 --> 02:06:56.128]  Oh, very evil.
[02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:59.911]  Americans getting together and demonstrating and asking government questions.
[02:06:59.991 --> 02:07:00.911]  I agree with Glenn Beck.
[02:07:00.951 --> 02:07:01.752]  That's dangerous.
[02:07:01.772 --> 02:07:03.573]  So tell me more about it.
[02:07:03.593 --> 02:07:08.357]  We have that video posted on the site, and if I can, I'll just give out my email real quick.
[02:07:08.377 --> 02:07:11.199]  It's Craig at WeAreChangedNewJersey.org.
[02:07:11.799 --> 02:07:12.059]  Good.
[02:07:12.159 --> 02:07:14.421]  And tell me more about what you guys are doing.
[02:07:15.682 --> 02:07:17.303]  Basically, right now, the site's brand new.
[02:07:17.363 --> 02:07:19.064]  It's only been up for about eight days now.
[02:07:19.665 --> 02:07:22.867]  We're just trying to organize and get together everybody in New Jersey.
[02:07:23.434 --> 02:07:43.793]  No matter what group you belong to, NFED, Campaign for Liberty, We Are Change, Jersey City, 9-11 Truth, we all have to come together at this critical point in American history right now, and just try to stomp out the path to socialism that we're seeing right now.
[02:07:45.635 --> 02:07:46.516]  I appreciate your call.
[02:07:46.556 --> 02:07:47.797]  Good to hear from you, Craig.
[02:07:48.197 --> 02:07:49.738]  Matthew in Pennsylvania.
[02:07:49.778 --> 02:07:50.659]  You're on the air.
[02:07:51.019 --> 02:07:53.682]  If you protest in any way, the Army says you're a terrorist.
[02:07:53.702 --> 02:07:54.642]  Go ahead, terrorist.
[02:07:55.103 --> 02:07:55.703]  That's right.
[02:07:56.104 --> 02:07:57.945]  I'm growing my own tomatoes over here.
[02:07:59.446 --> 02:08:00.387]  Without a license?
[02:08:00.988 --> 02:08:01.568]  That's right.
[02:08:01.688 --> 02:08:04.010]  SWAT teams are now raiding people nationwide for that?
[02:08:04.070 --> 02:08:04.651]  I'm not kidding.
[02:08:04.691 --> 02:08:05.632]  Go ahead, terrorist.
[02:08:05.652 --> 02:08:06.032]  That's right.
[02:08:06.292 --> 02:08:09.535]  Hey, have you seen Naomi Wolf's latest installment?
[02:08:10.549 --> 02:08:13.130]  I saw a video she made about the police state a few months ago.
[02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:14.070]  Is there another one?
[02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:17.731]  Yeah, well, there's the two DVD of the end of America.
[02:08:19.311 --> 02:08:22.292]  Yeah, we tried to have her on twice, but her phone never works when she's on.
[02:08:22.312 --> 02:08:37.095]  Very strange, but... Yeah, I found one part of it very, very disgusting, where they had a release up in the Hamptons, and they're all drinking wine and kind of saying that they're part of the resistance.
[02:08:39.495 --> 02:08:45.438]  I'd just like to say that here at home, we're growing tomatoes, and we're going to throw them at the stage.
[02:08:46.579 --> 02:08:47.079]  Oh my God.
[02:08:47.099 --> 02:08:48.100]  Thank you!
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:49.460]  Good night!
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:50.841]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:08:51.061 --> 02:08:52.142]  Very, very frightening.
[02:08:52.162 --> 02:08:54.363]  I think he's eaten those tomatoes.
[02:08:54.403 --> 02:08:55.383]  They made him go crazy.
[02:08:55.463 --> 02:08:56.164]  It's Al-Qaeda.
[02:08:56.924 --> 02:08:58.285]  Oh my God, Al-Qaeda.
[02:08:58.305 --> 02:08:59.805]  Alright, who's up next here?
[02:09:01.927 --> 02:09:03.988]  Another Gregory from California.
[02:09:04.028 --> 02:09:04.748]  Go ahead, Gregory.
[02:09:04.768 --> 02:09:06.589]  Hey, how you doing brother Alex?
[02:09:07.584 --> 02:09:08.365]  You know how to talk.
[02:09:08.405 --> 02:09:09.685]  That's another sign of Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:10.385 --> 02:09:11.646]  You need more fluoride pills.
[02:09:11.706 --> 02:09:12.346]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:09:13.167 --> 02:09:21.951]  Well, uh... No, in the future, being able to talk is going to be seen as... I'm not kidding, because they're going to reduce the language down to nothing, but a very shocking and arrestable offense.
[02:09:21.991 --> 02:09:22.811]  Go ahead and commit crimes.
[02:09:22.851 --> 02:09:23.412]  Go ahead and talk.
[02:09:24.112 --> 02:09:34.797]  Well, I was going to ask you, the last time I took a break from your show, I got taken off into Orange County Jail a couple months after old Christopher Jones had to go through there.
[02:09:35.956 --> 02:09:40.939]  Ah yes, Chris Jones, who shot the video inside Bohemian Grove, taken away to prison.
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:49.525]  I remember, I think that was around October, I tried getting a hold of a friend of mine that trains.
[02:09:49.565 --> 02:09:55.229]  He knows the guy that trains the men over in Music Honor Ranch, I believe, but I couldn't get a hold of him.
[02:09:55.549 --> 02:09:58.151]  But just to figure out, I was hoping to ask him, how'd that go?
[02:09:58.171 --> 02:10:02.193]  Alright, I'm a little confused, but I appreciate your call, Gregory.
[02:10:02.213 --> 02:10:02.874]  Good to hear from you.
[02:10:04.364 --> 02:10:06.568]  I remember, you want to know the whole Chris Jones story?
[02:10:06.688 --> 02:10:09.754]  People have asked me about that in emails and I've forgotten to comment on it.
[02:10:10.014 --> 02:10:12.238]  Chris Jones, okay?
[02:10:12.959 --> 02:10:16.165]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove with Mike Hanson in 2000 and shot that video.
[02:10:17.045 --> 02:10:18.506]  And people for years said it wasn't real.
[02:10:18.886 --> 02:10:20.508]  Now the Bohemian Grove admits I snuck in.
[02:10:21.168 --> 02:10:23.510]  And we had out in the woods and didn't try to be social.
[02:10:23.530 --> 02:10:24.551]  That's why we didn't get caught.
[02:10:24.891 --> 02:10:27.953]  Like the Vanity Fair and People Magazine and CBS reporters.
[02:10:28.934 --> 02:10:33.597]  It's more than 15 reporters, you count them up, that have been arrested and charged with trespassing.
[02:10:34.298 --> 02:10:37.000]  I snuck in, hid out, and got out of there.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.242]  The few times I was out in public, I got questioned and almost got caught.
[02:10:40.582 --> 02:10:43.705]  But the issue is, then,
[02:10:46.207 --> 02:10:57.916]  In 2004, Officer Jack McClam called up and he said, my webmaster lives in California and he's applied for a job there.
[02:10:58.436 --> 02:10:59.717]  Do you want him to shoot?
[02:11:00.658 --> 02:11:01.718]  He's going to shoot video.
[02:11:01.758 --> 02:11:02.279]  Do you want it?
[02:11:02.839 --> 02:11:03.540]  And I said, no.
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:05.982]  I'm not going to have anything to do with anybody else going in there.
[02:11:06.402 --> 02:11:08.023]  They're going to end up charging him.
[02:11:08.063 --> 02:11:08.784]  He's going to go to jail.
[02:11:09.264 --> 02:11:10.305]  I'm not going to put anybody
[02:11:12.170 --> 02:11:17.431]  Into a position to go to jail, but I talked to Chris Jones and I said, if you want to do it, go ahead and do it.
[02:11:17.451 --> 02:11:18.612]  But I said, this isn't a joke.
[02:11:18.652 --> 02:11:19.932]  I got death threats over this.
[02:11:20.652 --> 02:11:22.292]  And I said, I'm a public figure.
[02:11:23.113 --> 02:11:24.613]  It's why they haven't come after me that bad.
[02:11:24.633 --> 02:11:26.353]  But bad stuff's happened to other people.
[02:11:27.234 --> 02:11:29.634]  And the Bohemian Grove's connected to the Polly Kloss murder.
[02:11:29.674 --> 02:11:30.854]  They found her right outside there.
[02:11:31.435 --> 02:11:33.815]  And I said, these are very serious people.
[02:11:34.295 --> 02:11:35.416]  And I said, I risk my life.
[02:11:35.456 --> 02:11:37.376]  And I advise Chris Jones not to do it.
[02:11:37.936 --> 02:11:40.697]  Well, about two weeks after the Bohemian Grove that year,
[02:11:41.895 --> 02:11:48.821]  In comes the mail, memory stick, shot off the little Sony cameras that are still cameras that also shoot video, of him getting footage.
[02:11:50.082 --> 02:11:58.688]  And I told him not to tell people, we gave him, and then finally he went public who he was, and they went and SWAT teamed him and arrested him and set him up.
[02:11:59.149 --> 02:12:10.738]  They said that because he showed Neighbors, my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, that's aired on Trio Network, the footage, that that was a real murder of a child and that he did it.
[02:12:11.837 --> 02:12:12.878]  This is in the newspaper.
[02:12:13.719 --> 02:12:22.666]  That's how, and they got a jury that was so dumbed down like the Salem Witch Trials, that they believe Chris Jones had been part of a satanic ritual and had shown people.
[02:12:25.368 --> 02:12:27.050]  That's how America operates now.
[02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:33.755]  So, a lot of people talk about getting jobs or infiltrating it.
[02:12:34.176 --> 02:12:35.617]  It isn't a game.
[02:12:37.679 --> 02:12:39.100]  It isn't a game.
[02:12:40.148 --> 02:12:41.348]  We have the FBI here.
[02:12:41.368 --> 02:12:44.630]  I have all sorts of crap happen to me that I don't even want to get into.
[02:12:45.250 --> 02:12:46.830]  This is not a game, folks.
[02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:47.931]  This is not a joke.
[02:12:48.371 --> 02:12:50.412]  This is not a... And I kept telling Chris.
[02:12:50.472 --> 02:12:53.112]  I said, Chris, you've got to stop telling people who you really are.
[02:12:54.053 --> 02:13:00.115]  I said, you know... And then he went further.
[02:13:00.155 --> 02:13:01.555]  He tried to get a job there again.
[02:13:02.396 --> 02:13:03.616]  And that's when they came and arrested him.
[02:13:03.856 --> 02:13:05.997]  Four bohemian groves saying he was killing children.
[02:13:07.945 --> 02:13:09.545]  And he's in prison last time I checked.
[02:13:10.106 --> 02:13:12.226]  I mean, this is how America operates, folks.
[02:13:13.066 --> 02:13:18.848]  I mean, I could take you to a town ten miles from here where the cops will pull you over, punch you right in the face, and take your wallet and laugh at you.
[02:13:19.168 --> 02:13:20.969]  And it's on CNN and nobody's going to stop them.
[02:13:21.929 --> 02:13:23.989]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:13:24.610 --> 02:13:28.971]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kyle in California.
[02:13:29.011 --> 02:13:29.871]  Kyle, you're on the air.
[02:13:30.871 --> 02:13:31.872]  Hey, Mr. Jones, how you doing?
[02:13:32.252 --> 02:13:32.492]  Good.
[02:13:34.295 --> 02:13:35.676]  Well, it all started like this.
[02:13:35.796 --> 02:13:38.178]  We were out there interviewing Branch Davidians.
[02:13:53.612 --> 02:13:54.433]  to make a documentary
[02:14:11.741 --> 02:14:12.722]  And Mike Hanson was with me.
[02:14:12.742 --> 02:14:13.922]  He goes, oh yeah, we'll do it.
[02:14:13.962 --> 02:14:15.403]  I said, Mike, I don't have the money for that.
[02:14:15.423 --> 02:14:16.564]  He goes, oh, just ask your listeners.
[02:14:16.584 --> 02:14:17.845]  It'll be a small little shack.
[02:14:18.305 --> 02:14:19.406]  Costs a few thousand dollars.
[02:14:20.046 --> 02:14:27.430]  Then George Pullian, since deceased an architect, shows up and draws up this giant thing with 48 columns and holds 400 people.
[02:14:27.490 --> 02:14:30.152]  And so the feds can't burn it down.
[02:14:30.212 --> 02:14:31.753]  It'll be built out of hardy board.
[02:14:31.813 --> 02:14:33.954]  And it's not fancy, but it's big.
[02:14:34.374 --> 02:14:38.117]  And so that happened without even my control and just got built.
[02:14:39.071 --> 02:14:43.217]  Uh, so that's the whole... You're pretty well known for that, that uh, you know, stirring up the feathers.
[02:14:43.237 --> 02:14:49.746]  You have a lot of information on a lot of subjects and a lot of, uh... Yeah, no, no, I was just filling that in, because Wikipedia won't let me spell my name right.
[02:14:50.626 --> 02:14:54.608]  They won't let me get my info, and it says I built the Davidian church like I was with Koresh.
[02:14:54.628 --> 02:14:55.388]  I never met Koresh.
[02:14:55.708 --> 02:15:06.013]  I built a memorial church with a plaque for the officers that died as well, and the media says I am a Davidian who built the thing with Koresh, and it's all lies.
[02:15:06.753 --> 02:15:15.177]  USA Today is on InfoWars.com that says we're building a memorial church for those that died, but I'm just explaining that that's how the media twists things.
[02:15:15.457 --> 02:15:17.198]  People now think I'm a Davidian that
[02:15:17.498 --> 02:15:20.739]  That was there in the siege and firing with the B.A.T.F.
[02:15:20.799 --> 02:15:26.580]  and I barely survived and I was with Al-Qaeda and none of it's true.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:30.041]  How many years after did you sneak into Bohemian Grove after you did the Waco thing?
[02:15:30.081 --> 02:15:31.001]  A year.
[02:15:31.281 --> 02:15:31.821]  A year later.
[02:15:33.502 --> 02:15:41.524]  Can you explain to me how someone like you can stir up so many feathers, ruffle up so many feathers with the elite, or if you will, the people who control the world?
[02:15:41.544 --> 02:15:42.284]  Yeah, I can explain how.
[02:15:42.324 --> 02:15:43.264]  The force is with me.
[02:15:44.505 --> 02:15:45.685]  I mean, I believe in God.
[02:15:47.997 --> 02:15:50.999]  I'm not comparing myself to Davy Crockett, but have you ever read all his exploits?
[02:15:51.719 --> 02:15:53.360]  A hundred times the man I am.
[02:15:55.121 --> 02:15:59.384]  Look, I'm in the media and I'm doing these things and I've paid a great price.
[02:15:59.884 --> 02:16:01.165]  Well, who controls the media?
[02:16:01.185 --> 02:16:01.886]  The national press?
[02:16:01.946 --> 02:16:02.286]  Reuters?
[02:16:02.326 --> 02:16:03.026]  And who owns them?
[02:16:03.086 --> 02:16:03.767]  The Rothschilds?
[02:16:04.347 --> 02:16:06.268]  And you interviewed David the Rothschild?
[02:16:07.890 --> 02:16:09.270]  Oh, this is an attack call?
[02:16:09.290 --> 02:16:11.452]  Well, let me stop you and actually answer that question.
[02:16:13.073 --> 02:16:14.674]  Have you heard that Rothschild interview?
[02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.910]  Kind of.
[02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:17.650]  I listen to it a little bit.
[02:16:17.670 --> 02:16:21.353]  I'm really not into the whole eco-green thing and whatnot.
[02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:24.054]  Well, you better be, because they're using that to take over.
[02:16:24.795 --> 02:16:29.778]  He put out a book, a children's book, about how the polar bears can't swim and all this.
[02:16:30.099 --> 02:16:34.602]  So let me tell you how we get big guests for all the other shows that are lazy and then think we have magical powers.
[02:16:35.262 --> 02:16:40.605]  We pick up the phone and we call up and we say, we would like to interview Mr. Rothschild.
[02:16:40.645 --> 02:16:48.809]  And she's like, well he's doing 14 interviews today and 20 tomorrow to promote his book, but we can give you 10 minutes on this day.
[02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:52.791]  And then you get him on and then you keep him on and you get in an argument with him.
[02:16:53.091 --> 02:16:57.653]  Like people thought that was staged that I was at the Republican National Convention and saw David Gergen.
[02:16:57.813 --> 02:16:58.914]  Who do you think said that?
[02:16:59.234 --> 02:17:00.695]  Sean Hannity and David Gergen.
[02:17:01.475 --> 02:17:03.277]  I walk up and talk to David Gergen.
[02:17:03.477 --> 02:17:04.398]  No, this is real.
[02:17:04.458 --> 02:17:09.863]  If you'd get up off your butt and go out and live... I mean, I'm the guy that predicted 9-11.
[02:17:10.203 --> 02:17:10.924]  Hold on, put him on hold.
[02:17:10.944 --> 02:17:11.544]  I'm gonna hold him over.
[02:17:11.825 --> 02:17:13.186]  I'm the guy that predicted 9-11.
[02:17:13.446 --> 02:17:15.208]  I'm the guy that makes the first 9-11 film.
[02:17:15.408 --> 02:17:16.949]  I'm the guy that makes the big Obama film.
[02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:18.711]  I'm the guy because I work.
[02:17:19.011 --> 02:17:19.592]  I work.
[02:17:19.972 --> 02:17:20.513]  I work.
[02:17:20.693 --> 02:17:22.054]  I bust my butt.
[02:17:22.574 --> 02:17:24.416]  I fight the New World Order.
[02:17:24.836 --> 02:17:25.977]  That's how I do it.
[02:17:26.801 --> 02:17:28.924]  Okay, I thought you were asking about the Davidians there.
[02:17:29.344 --> 02:17:31.326]  Okay, I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[02:17:32.107 --> 02:17:35.551]  I'm the only one, the only mission in there to ever get out of there.
[02:17:36.392 --> 02:17:38.855]  Okay, and I did it because God is with me.
[02:17:39.295 --> 02:17:41.217]  And if He's with you, who can be against you?
[02:17:41.237 --> 02:17:42.299]  See, I believe in God.
[02:17:44.062 --> 02:17:52.225]  And so the fact that you would attack my credibility as if I'm not the real McCoy, because I got radio producers that know how to pick a telephone up, is baloney.
[02:17:52.706 --> 02:17:55.387]  But we'll come back to you with your BS.
[02:17:55.647 --> 02:17:57.788]  See, I'm not the bankers taking your life over.
[02:17:58.068 --> 02:17:59.228]  I'm the guy waking people up.
[02:17:59.368 --> 02:18:00.169]  I'm the good guy.
[02:18:00.649 --> 02:18:10.753]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:18:11.233 --> 02:18:12.194]  Garden in a can.
[02:18:12.654 --> 02:18:13.355]  We're good to go.
[02:18:31.235 --> 02:18:32.255]  Garden in a Can.
[02:18:32.655 --> 02:18:33.516]  It's that simple.
[02:18:33.856 --> 02:18:35.736]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[02:18:36.256 --> 02:18:40.218]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[02:18:40.598 --> 02:18:41.518]  Ready when you are.
[02:18:42.158 --> 02:18:45.799]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.

[02:19:00.251 --> 02:19:05.481]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:19:06.272 --> 02:19:11.616]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:19:12.157 --> 02:19:18.361]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:19:18.661 --> 02:19:20.483]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:19:20.623 --> 02:19:23.025]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:19:23.085 --> 02:19:33.973]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:19:36.275 --> 02:19:37.516]  It's not about left or right.
[02:19:37.936 --> 02:19:39.337]  It's about a one world government.
[02:19:39.797 --> 02:19:46.161]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:19:46.702 --> 02:19:54.487]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:19:54.967 --> 02:19:56.128]  The Obama Deception.
[02:19:56.548 --> 02:19:57.729]  The people strike back.
[02:19:59.224 --> 02:20:03.546]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[02:20:03.746 --> 02:20:06.168]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[02:20:06.328 --> 02:20:07.068]  He was devastated.
[02:20:07.208 --> 02:20:15.873]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[02:20:15.993 --> 02:20:21.876]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[02:20:22.196 --> 02:20:24.697]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[02:20:24.897 --> 02:20:27.278]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[02:20:28.419 --> 02:20:28.739]  I think so.
[02:20:52.572 --> 02:20:56.156]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[02:20:56.356 --> 02:20:58.839]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[02:21:08.533 --> 02:21:09.613]  Alright, final segment.
[02:21:10.114 --> 02:21:11.454]  And I want to hit this final news.
[02:21:11.494 --> 02:21:15.276]  DOD training manual describes protest as low-level terrorism.
[02:21:16.136 --> 02:21:25.720]  Yes, Kyle in California, I get calls and emails all the time saying, I didn't really sneak into Bohemian Grove, or I'm New World Order this, I'm New World Order that.
[02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:31.542]  I am a stand-alone, self-made, alternative media person who has great supporters that support me.
[02:21:32.082 --> 02:21:33.903]  The whole New World Order is coming down on us.
[02:21:34.003 --> 02:21:35.764]  I'm fighting everything the bankers are doing.
[02:21:37.032 --> 02:21:40.734]  And you're... I guess what you're saying is it's all fake?
[02:21:41.814 --> 02:21:42.995]  No, I'm not saying it's all fake.
[02:21:43.035 --> 02:21:47.957]  I would like to explain to you what has become apparent to me and I'm... Let me explain my position.
[02:21:48.277 --> 02:21:49.918]  I'm a regular... I was born in 1984.
[02:21:49.958 --> 02:21:50.018]  I'm 25.
[02:21:50.058 --> 02:21:50.618]  I'm a regular person.
[02:21:52.998 --> 02:21:55.300]  I live in a small town in Northern California.
[02:22:23.398 --> 02:22:24.079]  What is the point?
[02:22:24.139 --> 02:22:25.019]  What are you trying to say?
[02:22:25.079 --> 02:22:25.700]  Boil it down.
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:26.980]  Okay, you're in California.
[02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:27.541]  Okay, great.
[02:22:27.581 --> 02:22:28.001]  Go ahead.
[02:22:28.341 --> 02:22:28.821]  Cutting me off.
[02:22:29.162 --> 02:22:30.703]  Listen, I'm not cutting you off.
[02:22:30.743 --> 02:22:31.403]  Hold on a minute.
[02:22:31.803 --> 02:22:32.884]  Make your point, man.
[02:22:32.904 --> 02:22:35.025]  I mean, what are you trying to say here to me?
[02:22:35.285 --> 02:22:45.491]  How can someone like you keep stern of feathers and actually even be on the air still when people like Phil Schneider or even John F. Kennedy, who told all about secret societies, got captured.
[02:22:45.511 --> 02:22:46.752]  Are you more important than these people?
[02:22:47.293 --> 02:22:48.133]  I don't think so.
[02:22:48.153 --> 02:22:53.535]  Like, in 1995 Phil Steiner was talking about the New World Order and then he got strangled by it.
[02:22:53.575 --> 02:22:54.895]  So you are saying I'm bad?
[02:22:55.196 --> 02:22:55.536]  You are?
[02:22:56.176 --> 02:22:56.776]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:22:56.856 --> 02:22:59.377]  I do believe that these people are allowing you to do this.
[02:22:59.457 --> 02:23:05.179]  Even if you don't know that they're allowing you to do this and you're ignorant of it, I know who... Alright, let me stop you right there.
[02:23:05.579 --> 02:23:06.539]  I gotta let you go, okay?
[02:23:06.859 --> 02:23:08.960]  Look, what are you gonna do about the New World Order?
[02:23:09.967 --> 02:23:16.554]  Instead of killing the messenger, and always doing the mentally ill excuse of, well, they're letting you do it, so I'm not going to fight the New World Order.
[02:23:16.754 --> 02:23:17.514]  What does that mean?
[02:23:18.415 --> 02:23:26.403]  Absolutely, they've tried to intimidate me, they've tried to buy me off, they've come up and punched me in the nose, they've had the IRS come after me, they've done everything you can imagine.
[02:23:28.045 --> 02:23:28.645]  And then some.
[02:23:29.366 --> 02:23:33.250]  They've tried to call up and mess with my wife, and I've stayed on mission.
[02:23:35.262 --> 02:23:35.702]  Okay?
[02:23:36.663 --> 02:23:38.964]  And they killed Kennedy years after he fought him.
[02:23:38.984 --> 02:23:41.025]  They killed Gandhi decades after he fought him.
[02:23:42.125 --> 02:23:45.467]  I'm not Martin Luther King with three million people in front of me about to change the whole world.
[02:23:45.587 --> 02:23:48.048]  I think you get a little too big of an image of how big I am.
[02:23:48.348 --> 02:23:51.250]  I am getting bigger and it's dangerous and I don't frankly enjoy it.
[02:23:52.381 --> 02:23:57.406]  But it's a catch-22, I gotta get even bigger to survive, but then that also is a danger.
[02:23:58.026 --> 02:24:00.809]  So regardless, my fruits are good, I've done well.
[02:24:01.470 --> 02:24:06.134]  And it isn't just that I don't like being lied about, because I know I'm legitimate, I know I'm for real.
[02:24:06.995 --> 02:24:12.800]  It also destroys the image of what I am, an image for others, a model to build and fight tyranny.
[02:24:13.121 --> 02:24:15.103]  The globalists are not all powerful!
[02:24:16.929 --> 02:24:19.730]  A lot of their own people now are waking up and wanting to join us.
[02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:20.671]  We could win!
[02:24:20.971 --> 02:24:23.772]  But as we win, people aren't going to believe we can win.
[02:24:24.293 --> 02:24:26.694]  Because the church has been bought off and paid off and told.
[02:24:28.672 --> 02:24:31.914]  All these lies, and that, you know, it's the end of the world, we can't fight evil.
[02:24:32.455 --> 02:24:33.896]  Well, let's say it's the end of the world.
[02:24:34.056 --> 02:24:35.096]  We have a duty to fight evil.
[02:24:35.156 --> 02:24:36.017]  I meant to get to this.
[02:24:36.077 --> 02:24:36.958]  Folks, this is important.
[02:24:36.978 --> 02:24:39.559]  This is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:42.801]  DOD training manual describes protests as low-level terrorism.
[02:24:43.122 --> 02:24:53.509]  The Army official training manual given to all military in the Army teaches that any type of protest is terrorism and that all peace protesting supports Al Qaeda.
[02:24:53.869 --> 02:24:55.950]  Same thing we've heard before, but now the Army's taught this.
[02:24:56.411 --> 02:24:58.132]  This is mainstream news reporting this.
[02:24:59.713 --> 02:25:00.694]  This is just horrible.
[02:25:01.555 --> 02:25:06.980]  And we've got to focus on what that's happening there and get back our Bill of Rights and Constitution and say no to that.
[02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:10.763]  Instead of obsessing all day on how is Alex Jones still alive.
[02:25:11.564 --> 02:25:13.926]  I'm alive because if they kill me it'll make me a hero.
[02:25:14.347 --> 02:25:19.591]  Now at a point where I'm leading movements so big it may challenge him like a Ron Paul, they may do something to me.
[02:25:19.651 --> 02:25:22.934]  Ron Paul said he's in danger, but he's marching forward.
[02:25:23.715 --> 02:25:28.199]  We need to support him and realize those that are attacking him are operatives or mentally ill.
[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:29.701]  This is real, folks.
[02:25:30.041 --> 02:25:30.602]  I am real.
[02:25:31.403 --> 02:25:33.445]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.

[02:25:35.026 --> 02:25:35.767]  Great job, crew.

[02:25:37.008 --> 02:25:39.010]  Transmission continues on the other side.

[02:25:50.438 --> 02:25:52.020]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:56.787]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:25:56.867 --> 02:25:59.631]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:25:59.831 --> 02:26:02.675]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:26:02.875 --> 02:26:07.602]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:26:07.822 --> 02:26:08.743]  If you simply prepare.
[02:26:08.943 --> 02:26:11.885]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:26:12.185 --> 02:26:19.071]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
