[00:00:01.198 --> 00:00:03.881]  All our times have come Here but now they're gone
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.081]  Here it is, my friends, just out in the last month or so.
[00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:35.144]  The newest Daniel Lesterlin updated, revised, and expanded North American Union Edition.
[00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:35.984]  It is a lot thicker.
[00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:39.926]  Hundreds of photos, documents available at InfoWars.com.
[00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:45.529]  We're proud to carry this book in the InfoWars.com bookstore video shopping cart.
[00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:55.141]  Also, a great companion to it is my film that covers Bilderberg and the New World Order Master Plan, Endgame, Blueprint 4, Global, Enslavement.
[00:00:55.702 --> 00:01:01.430]  Joining us for the next 25 minutes or so is Daniel Estelin via cell phone from rural Spain.
[00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.733]  He's got a big press conference coming up Friday.
[00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:04.354]  His book,
[00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:05.914]  We're good to go.
[00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:33.823]  That separately have worked with the Philip K. Dick estate with his daughters and confirmed that they knew the Halcyon Group and what they were doing.
[00:01:33.883 --> 00:01:35.384]  So that was very, very exciting.
[00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:36.784]  So he's here to talk about that as well.
[00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:39.365]  But first, the hit piece.
[00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:41.186]  And that's what Bloomberg's reporting.
[00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:42.266]  They're very excited.
[00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:43.367]  The New York Times likes it.
[00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:46.167]  The establishment loves this new film, The New World Order.
[00:01:46.448 --> 00:01:48.648]  They think it makes us all look like a bunch of idiots.
[00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:52.970]  Daniel Estlin was interviewed for this film, but wasn't in the film.
[00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.153]  And I think he wasn't in the film because following him around for two years, they couldn't find anything to make him fit into their stereotypical conspiracy theorist box.
[00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:07.194]  They did find that following me around for two years, but in the end it's just going to backfire on them.
[00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:08.795]  Daniel Estelin, great to have you here with us.
[00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:10.838]  Thanks for having me on your show, Alex.
[00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:11.498]  Absolutely.
[00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:13.199]  The people from the Seeping Productions, again.
[00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.119]  It's not that they made us look like idiots.
[00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.159]  They made us look like crazies.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.680]  That's exactly what I was talking about a few days ago on one of the radio and television shows from England.
[00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:24.961]  You know, I'm tired of seeing time and again how people who are fighting this thing should know better.
[00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:28.902]  Actually, you know, fall for this, you know, same trick each and every time.
[00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:31.643]  Now, these people, you know, look at whatever the other character's name.
[00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:44.955]  They followed me around for a year, a year and a half, while we were in the United States, promoting my book, The True Story of the Buildable Group, from New York to Portland, I think to Eugene, and I can't remember if they went with us to California or not, but they certainly went from East Coast to the West Coast.
[00:02:45.435 --> 00:02:53.182]  And certainly, they obviously didn't have anything worthy of making me look like an idiot or crazy, so they decided to take it out.
[00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:54.883]  Well, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:02:55.123 --> 00:03:03.307]  And again, you know, these are the people with some very dark, sinister objectives, whatever they may be, but they certainly haven't done us any favors.
[00:03:03.647 --> 00:03:18.475]  Because, again, talking to the people who understand, who are part of the establishment, they're all basically saying, shaking their heads, you know, this thing, this documentary, these heaping productions, New World Order, has taken us, you know, not a couple of steps back, but way, way back in this fight, because, again,
[00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:30.524]  You cannot wear toilet seat around your neck or G-string around your head while you scream the government did it from a corner of a major intersection in New York City and be taken seriously by anybody who's a normal Joe.
[00:03:30.584 --> 00:03:31.845]  And I think that's the objective.
[00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:47.377]  The objective is not to talk to each other, as so many people do on all these, you know, chats and forums, but actually go out and try to convince normal 9-to-5 working people who go to work, who come home, who watch television, play golf on the weekends, play cards with friends, do barbecues,
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.585]  Well, absolutely.
[00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:05.151]  You know, the issue here, the way Bloomberg and the LA Times and the New York Times are going after me on this is, is by association.
[00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:14.519]  And then they also, I had Bilderberg Security walk up to me in the bar the night before it closed, in Chantilly, and they said, people pull fire alarms, they go to prison.
[00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.540]  They try to steal vases.
[00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:19.145]  And Rob Jacobson was my witness.
[00:04:19.165 --> 00:04:19.565]  He's with me.
[00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:20.546]  And we go, what are you talking about?
[00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:21.207]  Pull fire alarms.
[00:04:21.707 --> 00:04:22.948]  We go upstairs.
[00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.190]  The door closes.
[00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:28.454]  Right as I go on a radio show, the fire alarm goes off.
[00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:33.899]  Then I go downstairs, and the head of security walks up and says, I'm going to F you up, Jones.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.662]  And all of this happens.
[00:04:37.462 --> 00:04:37.763]  And then
[00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:41.537]  The way the movie makes it look, I'm crazy.
[00:04:41.797 --> 00:04:49.078]  I think a fire alarm is for me, and that's what the... I mean, I can't help, Daniel, when the media just lies.
[00:04:50.378 --> 00:04:53.419]  And, you know, when Bloomberg says, I'm imagining fire alarms.
[00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:58.980]  I mean, the news is saying, I'm imagining cars following us that followed us off Bilderberg.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.301]  I mean, I had guys walking up to me at my hotel saying, let's go attack the State Department together.
[00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:06.042]  And they were big FBI agents.
[00:05:06.282 --> 00:05:06.602]  And, you know,
[00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:19.552]  So, you know, we're in reality, which looks kooky to people, and then the mainline public's so dumbed down, it looks, yeah, I mean, it can be made to look crazy, and they stick the one guy in there from England or Ireland who thinks he has a chip in his head.
[00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:22.994]  You know, that's the production company's issue.
[00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:30.060]  I mean, I guess I could turn down all interviews in the future, or you could, and I actually am turning down a lot of interviews.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.302]  I mean, how do you handle that, Daniel?
[00:05:33.148 --> 00:05:34.749]  Well, you know, I'm going to give you an example.
[00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:45.334]  One of the things that the New York Times and the Washington Post as well have ever done is come anywhere near me or touch me because they know anything they throw at me I can actually deflect it and win any argument against them.
[00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:48.156]  You know, not very long ago I found one of the chats
[00:05:49.097 --> 00:05:56.122]  Uh, and one of the other, uh, websites, people talking about, you know, the need for creating a universal language.
[00:05:56.462 --> 00:06:01.566]  And a kind of thought occurred to me, you know, do people actually understand that, you know, part of H.G.
[00:06:01.706 --> 00:06:11.913]  Wells' ultimate revolution was, in fact, the elimination of all national languages in favor of what he called basic English, which out of a vocabulary, I would have had of a vocabulary of only 850 words.
[00:06:12.194 --> 00:06:13.995]  Now, if you ask people for an example,
[00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:21.658]  If people who are listening to the show, and you can explain it to others, because again, you cannot say government did it wearing a toilet seat around your neck.
[00:06:21.978 --> 00:06:24.299]  You have to explain to people who, why, what, and where.
[00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.141]  That's the only way we can actually get them on our side, because the only thing we can do is get people to listen.
[00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:34.143]  So for example, if I have a couple of minutes, I'd like to give you an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:40.229]  I want you to do that, but then in the time we have limited, I want to get into your new book, the work you're doing.
[00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.011]  You haven't been... I'll be real quick.
[00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:42.912]  I've got two minutes.
[00:06:43.372 --> 00:06:43.773]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:06:43.813 --> 00:06:48.277]  Now, as you know, we talked about this before, what today is called the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.439]  About six, seven hundred years ago had another name.
[00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:52.341]  It was called the Venetian Black Nobility.
[00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:55.064]  Now, these people who are today the Bilderbergers, they know
[00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:59.466]  That idea of a more powerful weapon than guns and fleets and bombs.
[00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:06.808]  Now, in order to secure acceptance for their imperial ideas, the Venetian nobility seeks to control the way people think.
[00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:07.489]  We know that.
[00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:15.292]  If you can control the way people think, say, the Venetians, you can control the way they respond to events, no matter what those events may be.
[00:07:15.332 --> 00:07:20.034]  So if we can do the same and get people actually, you know, to think the way we want them to think, we can win.
[00:07:20.094 --> 00:07:20.654]  For example,
[00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:22.562]  You know, we're talking about languages.
[00:07:23.182 --> 00:07:27.505]  Uh, in the early part of the, uh, 1200s, you know, Italian language didn't exist.
[00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:37.351]  It was born with a man by the name of Danzialieri, who was the, uh, of course, the writer, the great genius behind the Divine Comedy, who refined the cancel form of poetry.
[00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:43.993]  Now, his follower, Francesco Petrarca, sought to advance the language further with the invention of a sonnet.
[00:07:44.393 --> 00:07:48.294]  And Petrarca's friend, Boccaccio, invented this thing called the Decameron.
[00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:57.877]  A Decameron was written in order to prevent the Italian society from sinking into cultural pessimism and dying out during the Black Death of the 1340s.
[00:07:58.117 --> 00:07:59.998]  You see, that's how the Italian language was born.
[00:08:00.418 --> 00:08:03.179]  And Geoffrey Chaucer, who attended one of the lectures by Boccaccio,
[00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:04.259]  On Dan King 1375.
[00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:13.982]  He got the idea to do the same thing in English, and you have the Canterbury Tales, which of course recounts the hilarious tales told on a religious pilgrimage to the Church of Canterbury.
[00:08:14.282 --> 00:08:26.265]  The same thing happened in French, when the Christian humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam inspired his student François Rigolot to do the same in France by creating this amazing character called Gagatua.
[00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:30.146]  And then in Spanish, we have this great example of Don Quixote de la Mancha,
[00:08:30.993 --> 00:08:31.433]  That's right.
[00:08:52.572 --> 00:08:53.032]  We're good to go.
[00:09:22.176 --> 00:09:23.557]  I don't understand exactly what you're saying.
[00:09:38.442 --> 00:09:58.354]  But the point is that, you know, they're trying to do this, and if you explain to people from a logical perspective, without wearing a toilet seat or making crazy noises, which a lot of people do, then actually you have people who are listening to you from a point of view of logic and reason, and then we have them won over, because again, as long as logic and reason prevails, we can win this war.
[00:09:58.374 --> 00:10:01.376]  If people are basically talking to each other, here are two things.
[00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:13.284]  Okay, there's the principle and the technique, and the technique is that all these people, most of them are crazy, who are talking to each other in all these forums and chat, who don't make any sense to anybody outside the forum or the chat, alright?
[00:10:13.304 --> 00:10:30.457]  I don't know if it's childhood... And that's what you're saying, I understand, the Prison Planet forum was saying you're a Bilderberg group member, ridiculous... I'm not talking about... I'm just talking about... That's the crazies, that was somebody linking to a story, a million posts a month, I can't... And so many forums, in so many countries, it'll be in English and French and...
[00:10:31.712 --> 00:10:32.673]  I agree, that's what I do.
[00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:56.235]  And try to explain to people why what today is called Bilderberg 800 years ago was called something else, and why they're doing what they're doing, because again, to say, well, they're trying to take our freedom away, to most people, is just simply not good enough.
[00:10:56.515 --> 00:11:09.302]  Yeah, this is the true ruling council of the planet, and if you watch the European Parliament, as I've been doing, they admit it is a global Europe, is what they're calling it, and they're openly announcing world government, a bank of the world, that we will pay our carbon taxes to.
[00:11:09.322 --> 00:11:13.384]  Daniel, talking to you yesterday on the phone, you were starting to say peak oil was a scam.
[00:11:13.764 --> 00:11:16.609]  I know you've been trying to research it and questioning it a few years ago.
[00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.937]  Do you now believe that peak oil is a eugenicist, a false scarcity scam?
[00:11:22.938 --> 00:11:26.121]  No, look, you know, in the world there are two energy sources.
[00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:28.363]  One is called nuclear energy and the other one is called oil.
[00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:48.662]  Unfortunately, people who control the world will never let nuclear energy, which is the cheapest, you know, the best and the longest-lasting energy, you know, source in the entire world that can actually increase our population base from 6.7 billion to about 10 billion because, again, the energy flux density, the nuclear energy flux density, has nothing to do in terms of calories.
[00:11:49.062 --> 00:11:49.943]  We're good to go.
[00:12:06.217 --> 00:12:06.297]  Yes.
[00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:27.013]  Again, unfortunately, you know, this global warming is a big scam.
[00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:27.975]  It's not global warming.
[00:12:28.035 --> 00:12:29.897]  Actually, it's global cooling right now.
[00:12:30.077 --> 00:12:30.318]  Yes.
[00:12:30.338 --> 00:12:32.781]  You know, which will look in periods of about 100,000 years.
[00:12:33.202 --> 00:12:35.905]  And we're actually smack in the middle of global cooling.
[00:12:36.025 --> 00:12:36.566]  Absolutely.
[00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:38.589]  Our company will tell you otherwise.
[00:12:38.854 --> 00:12:48.240]  So this is a form of neo-serfdom, as the Royal Commission put out with the British in 1949 stated, to shut down the third world, not let them get resources to develop and deal with eugenics.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.202]  Now, Daniel, we've got limited time and we really appreciate you joining us.
[00:12:53.003 --> 00:12:59.607]  Again, the new book is out, the North American Union edition, available at InfoWars.com or just Google it.
[00:12:59.627 --> 00:13:02.909]  You can also go to DanielEstelan.com as well.
[00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.371]  Daniel, I want to talk about
[00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:24.717]  The big press conference coming up Friday, and you told me in confidence, which I was honored you did two years ago, that you'd done this movie deal, and now it's going to be made, and there's a press conference coming up that they're going to sync up Friday with the European premiere of Terminator film Salvation.
[00:13:24.977 --> 00:13:25.717]  Tell us about that.
[00:13:25.757 --> 00:13:26.978]  This is very, very exciting.
[00:13:27.838 --> 00:13:31.279]  Well, you know, the deal has been in the works for about four years.
[00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:34.560]  Obviously, you know, working with Hollywood, even if it's an independent studio, and they
[00:13:35.427 --> 00:13:36.288]  It takes time.
[00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:38.330]  It's a very long and arduous process.
[00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.231]  We've been talking to them since 2005.
[00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:43.073]  My book first was released in Spanish.
[00:13:43.154 --> 00:13:45.836]  It was out to my former agent in Sweden.
[00:13:46.456 --> 00:13:57.746]  And this Friday we had a press conference announcing, during the European premiere of Terminator Salvation, that their next big movie is going to be a project that's going to be based on the true story of the Buildable Group.
[00:13:57.786 --> 00:13:58.967]  It's not going to be a documentary.
[00:13:58.987 --> 00:14:00.508]  It's going to be a full motion picture.
[00:14:02.043 --> 00:14:03.745]  Absolutely, that is so exciting.
[00:14:03.925 --> 00:14:06.208]  And is this going to be a thriller?
[00:14:06.248 --> 00:14:08.250]  I mean, can you give us any window?
[00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.131]  Is it a long line?
[00:14:09.151 --> 00:14:17.000]  Usually the way it works is they're probably going to commission four or five directors to write a mini-script.
[00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:22.727]  And based on each individual vision that the directors will have, and based on which one they like most,
[00:14:23.348 --> 00:14:24.909]  Is that one I'm going to probably go with?
[00:14:24.969 --> 00:14:29.693]  It's obviously going to be a money-making proposition.
[00:14:29.793 --> 00:14:37.579]  The budget for it is, I can't really say at this point in time, but it's a very, very big budget, dwarfing most budgets for most action-adventure films.
[00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:40.981]  But anyway, the idea is that these people are on the right track.
[00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:47.066]  Terminator Salvation is probably the highest grossing film of this year, if not one, definitely number two.
[00:14:50.338 --> 00:14:53.379]  The video game version is already doing very, very well.
[00:14:54.139 --> 00:15:02.241]  So, obviously, these people are going to have enough money to finance the project themselves, which is what we're actually very concerned with initially, and now we're very, very pleased.
[00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:03.181]  Absolutely.
[00:15:03.241 --> 00:15:09.403]  The toys alone are going to finance the next... You've got the toys, you've got the TV show spinoffs.
[00:15:10.163 --> 00:15:15.507]  Well, because of PG-13, but you know, that's why they terminate the termination of PG-13.
[00:15:16.147 --> 00:15:17.808]  And, you know, they can do the same for this one.
[00:15:17.828 --> 00:15:21.811]  That means that, you know, Burger King and company are going to have, you know, Daniel Astro and action figures.
[00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:27.695]  So, actually, this is the main hero is going to be you.
[00:15:28.652 --> 00:15:31.234]  Well, it's going to be based on someone like me.
[00:15:31.294 --> 00:15:40.542]  It's beyond the duplicity and the lies and the obfuscations and the deceit of the people behind the curtain.
[00:15:40.722 --> 00:15:48.348]  It's also a very human story of a person, me in this particular case, who against all odds tries to apply the truth and also tries to learn about himself.
[00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.971]  It's also a very human story as well on many different levels.
[00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:54.093]  And I guess that's one of the things that really appeals to them.
[00:15:54.113 --> 00:15:55.694]  It's not just good guys, bad guys.
[00:15:56.104 --> 00:15:59.692]  But it has so many other elements which you can play with and make into a beautiful movie.
[00:16:01.109 --> 00:16:04.490]  All right, Daniel, I want to get into where you've been the last few years.
[00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.530]  You've been very busy.
[00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.070]  I've always reported to folks that you've been writing another book.
[00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.831]  Some people are like, where have you been the last two Bilderbergs?
[00:16:11.131 --> 00:16:18.832]  You made the point that if it's a Bilderberg where you can't get good photos, we did get Bernanke and a few others in Chantilly, but if it's not good to get photos, what is the point?
[00:16:19.132 --> 00:16:20.552]  And also, you've been writing a new book.
[00:16:20.972 --> 00:16:27.994]  You told me the harrowing tales of what happened when you went to Africa to cover AFRICON and the takeover by the globalists there.
[00:16:28.294 --> 00:16:29.534]  Tell us about your
[00:16:30.495 --> 00:16:32.899]  New and by the way, I'm gonna skip this network break forever.
[00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:34.381]  This is a network break coming up.
[00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:37.887]  We're skipping it everybody That's the network and stations.
[00:16:38.388 --> 00:16:41.393]  Tell us about what you've been working on the last few years Daniel
[00:16:42.298 --> 00:16:50.825]  Well, again, like I said, there's been a lot of talk, because I get emails from people who send me links to chats and forums all over the world, people asking where I was.
[00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:55.609]  I don't understand why everybody is so concerned about where I am or what I'm doing.
[00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.232]  But the point is that I haven't gone to deliver over the last couple of years.
[00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.214]  I've been getting comments from certain individuals saying that
[00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:03.775]  I made so much money for my book, I no longer am interested.
[00:17:04.075 --> 00:17:12.938]  No, the reason I haven't gone this year or last year is because, you know, this year's Buildable Conference was held in the same hotel that I covered way back my first Buildable Conference in 1993.
[00:17:13.318 --> 00:17:14.018]  And I know the place.
[00:17:14.118 --> 00:17:16.899]  Last year, I know it very well too because I was there in 2002.
[00:17:16.939 --> 00:17:19.800]  There's absolutely no way to get anyone near the hotel.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.222]  Take a photograph and just to go there to be harassed by people.
[00:17:23.583 --> 00:17:27.005]  I don't need to do that because, again, I get information sitting in the living room of my house.
[00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:34.992]  As I've done this, you know, this particular year as well, scooping the whole world on a bill of order, pre-meeting agenda, and, you know, what these people have talked about.
[00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:40.035]  So that's the reason I haven't gone, not because I stopped doing it, because I think I make too much money and I'm too wealthy right now.
[00:17:40.336 --> 00:17:46.761]  And as far as I'm absolutely sure, I haven't done any interviews in the past year, or hardly any, simply because I've been working on my new book.
[00:17:46.801 --> 00:17:48.302]  Now, anyone who has written a book,
[00:17:48.877 --> 00:17:49.517]  I don't think so.
[00:18:10.983 --> 00:18:13.785]  My little finger started typing words and letters and sentences.
[00:18:14.085 --> 00:18:20.528]  A lot of the chapters in my new book, The Shadow Masters, which will be released by Friday sometime in October, talks about Africa.
[00:18:20.548 --> 00:18:39.757]  Well, basically what I've done is I've uncovered how international corporations, big behemoths such as Halliburton and Company, are working hand in glove with the world, European and North American governments, the Israelis, the Russians, even the Chinese are there, of course, in Sudan, the Americans, the Canadians, the French, the English,
[00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:48.275]  How all of them are working, and also with all the top NGOs in the world, from Human Rights Watch, to CARE, to Oxfam, etc.
[00:18:48.696 --> 00:18:50.817]  And they have only one objective in mind.
[00:18:50.857 --> 00:18:51.977]  I'm talking about Sudan.
[00:18:52.317 --> 00:18:58.320]  That is to get rid of all the blacks living there, so that they can get the natural resources under their feet.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.382]  Now, I didn't go with any tourist on a tourist visa.
[00:19:02.822 --> 00:19:05.163]  And I didn't go as an embedded reporter with anybody.
[00:19:05.263 --> 00:19:16.585]  I went with a group of very trusted comrades at Secret Service, and all of us, armed to the teeth, went to the areas which we thought necessary to go and see the things that were being done there to the people.
[00:19:16.605 --> 00:19:17.766]  And it's absolutely amazing.
[00:19:17.826 --> 00:19:19.106]  Africa is an amazing continent.
[00:19:19.426 --> 00:19:21.526]  You know, for $20,000, you can kill an elephant.
[00:19:21.846 --> 00:19:23.927]  For about $15,000, you can kill a lion.
[00:19:24.488 --> 00:19:27.733]  You were telling me you've got photos so hardcore you probably can't even put them in your book?
[00:19:40.658 --> 00:19:45.021]  Well, you know, as a matter of fact, you know, the Spanish version of this book was released last year.
[00:19:45.521 --> 00:19:49.044]  All right, just as because I live in Spain, you know, Buildable was first released in Spain.
[00:19:49.384 --> 00:19:50.865]  You know, this book was released in Spain.
[00:19:51.165 --> 00:19:54.908]  My publisher had a look at the photos, you know, they met with the lawyers and they said, we cannot do this.
[00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:56.909]  We cannot release these photographs.
[00:19:56.949 --> 00:19:58.370]  So basically we just released a few.
[00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:03.113]  But again, I will talk to Chris Milligan and see if we can actually get all these photographs in the book.
[00:20:03.133 --> 00:20:07.756]  But the point is that, again, it's an amazing continent of contrast.
[00:20:07.796 --> 00:20:10.538]  You can see literally cultures which have been untouched
[00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:13.162]  Well, Daniel, give us a window into this.
[00:20:13.222 --> 00:20:14.523]  It's important because you were there.
[00:20:14.603 --> 00:20:16.286]  You said you went with special forces people.
[00:20:17.387 --> 00:20:18.288]  You've got a lot of courage.
[00:20:18.308 --> 00:20:19.350]  You talk about adventure.
[00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.373]  I hope that's in the upcoming Bilderberg movie.
[00:20:21.873 --> 00:20:22.875]  Tell us some of what you saw.
[00:20:28.897 --> 00:20:38.922]  You know, everybody has assumed over the last decades and several generations, especially since the Second World War, you know, the British and the Americans, the Israelis and Americans, these things no longer exist.
[00:20:38.982 --> 00:20:45.985]  You know, the Americans are fighting the Israelis, the Israelis, the British, the British, the Americans, the Russians, the Chinese, the Chinese, the French, everybody's fighting each other.
[00:20:46.005 --> 00:20:48.967]  They're no longer, they're no longer friends, they're just temporary partners.
[00:20:49.522 --> 00:20:49.622]  Okay.
[00:20:49.682 --> 00:20:49.822]  Okay.
[00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:18.343]  Sure, sure.
[00:21:18.783 --> 00:21:21.184]  Daniel, we've got you on the schedule for another three or four minutes.
[00:21:21.204 --> 00:21:24.005]  Can you send somebody to the door to get that TV crew in there?
[00:21:24.965 --> 00:21:25.846]  I can probably do that.
[00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:26.766]  Okay, good.
[00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:33.889]  Well, let me just ask you these final questions here in the time we've got then, but can't wait to have you said in the next few weeks you'd come back on for an hour, correct?
[00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.910]  Well, you know, we'll definitely see it.
[00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.752]  It all depends on the Hollywood people exactly what they have in mind if there's promotion or not.
[00:21:42.276 --> 00:21:56.666]  No, regardless, I wanted to, when I talked to you yesterday, you said that you'd probably come on the next few weeks so we can talk more, because I want to talk about the intel you got from Bilderberg 2009, because I know you, as you've said, have people that have attended Bilderberg that you know.
[00:21:57.086 --> 00:21:59.648]  I don't know how much of what we talked about off-air I can even say.
[00:21:59.688 --> 00:22:00.448]  That's another issue.
[00:22:00.808 --> 00:22:11.936]  Did you see the articles about the meeting two weeks ago before Bilderberg, right before it, of David Rockefeller, of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, of Warren Buffett, where they admit here that, you know, basically,
[00:22:12.176 --> 00:22:12.432]  We're good.
[00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:23.802]  They don't want people to think they're an alternative to world government, and that the meeting was over population, and it was all about reducing world population, and that they really want to get this job done.
[00:22:24.282 --> 00:22:42.514]  Your comments on this group they're now calling... I haven't seen it, but you know, again, it's the policy of the World Wildlife Fund, you know, of the two degenerates, Prince Bernard of the Netherlands, one of the founders of the Willowbrook Group, and of course the consort for Queen Elizabeth II of England, Prince Philip.
[00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:46.744]  Uh, you know, both Nazis, both degenerates, and, uh, you know, that's their policy.
[00:22:47.124 --> 00:22:53.630]  Genocide will reduce the world population, which, again, is more or less the same policy as Greenpeace or Al Gore, you know?
[00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.691]  Uh, go green.
[00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:55.651]  Green is good.
[00:22:55.671 --> 00:22:57.032]  Uh, reduce the way we live.
[00:22:57.153 --> 00:22:58.814]  And, obviously, you know, back to the caves.
[00:22:59.254 --> 00:22:59.915]  That's not good.
[00:22:59.935 --> 00:23:00.695]  That's idiotic.
[00:23:00.735 --> 00:23:04.338]  And anybody who follows it, again, has to understand why they're talking about it.
[00:23:04.398 --> 00:23:06.140]  But, again, maybe we can talk about it the next time.
[00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.411]  Absolutely, neo-feudalism.
[00:23:09.031 --> 00:23:13.072]  Shadowmasters though, it's going to come out in the fall or winter of this year?
[00:23:13.092 --> 00:23:17.553]  It's going to come out in the fall.
[00:23:17.573 --> 00:23:17.913]  Daniel?
[00:23:18.674 --> 00:23:18.854]  What?
[00:23:18.934 --> 00:23:19.894]  It's going to come out in the fall.
[00:23:20.674 --> 00:23:21.695]  Very, very exciting.
[00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:28.737]  Just in the last minute or two, any key information that you haven't covered that you've gotten from Bilderberg this year?
[00:23:29.097 --> 00:23:30.057]  Any inside intel?
[00:23:31.318 --> 00:23:32.598]  I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything you said.
[00:23:33.354 --> 00:23:36.517]  Any extra info on what happened in Bilderberg 2009?
[00:23:36.597 --> 00:23:39.179]  Well, actually, yes.
[00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:42.202]  I'm just working on my Bilderberg report right now, and there's a lot of information.
[00:23:42.242 --> 00:23:50.709]  I have a 73-page, I know, report from these people, and I'm going very, very slowly through it, and when I have the whole thing done, what we'll do is we'll post it on my website.
[00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.252]  And that's danielesteland.com?
[00:23:54.173 --> 00:23:55.574]  Oh, or bilderbergbook.com.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.661]  All right, well, Daniel, I appreciate your time, and again, I'd like to get you up for a full interview in the near future.
[00:24:02.681 --> 00:24:03.941]  I hope the family's doing well.
[00:24:05.102 --> 00:24:09.102]  Everybody's doing well, and again, I want people to remember the seeping production of The New World Order.
[00:24:09.443 --> 00:24:18.804]  You know, they went after us, and they blindsided the people in the film, and obviously, you know, these people, one way or another, we have to let them know that certainly we don't agree with them.
[00:24:19.364 --> 00:24:21.605]  Did they promise you that it wasn't going to be a hit piece?
[00:24:23.494 --> 00:24:26.136]  Uh, you know, again, it doesn't really matter at this point.
[00:24:26.216 --> 00:24:26.936]  He said, she said.
[00:24:26.956 --> 00:24:31.099]  But the point is that, you know, you don't follow somebody around for a year and a half not to have them in a film.
[00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:32.059]  You know what I mean?
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.201]  So the intention was to have me there as a centerpiece.
[00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:36.542]  But unfortunately, I didn't say enough stupid things.
[00:24:36.602 --> 00:24:38.123]  So, you know, obviously it couldn't have been in a film.
[00:24:38.624 --> 00:24:42.386]  You know, like I said, you know, everything I say makes perfect logical sense.
[00:24:42.446 --> 00:24:42.726]  I get it.
[00:24:42.806 --> 00:24:44.467]  No, no, no, I... What's today called?
[00:24:44.587 --> 00:24:47.369]  The Bilderberg was called Venetian Abilitate out of years ago.
[00:24:47.409 --> 00:24:51.191]  Why language, you know, creates cultures and nations and not the other way around.
[00:24:51.431 --> 00:24:52.032]  I agree with you.
[00:24:52.864 --> 00:24:55.945]  You want people who wear toilet seats screaming the government did it?
[00:24:57.746 --> 00:25:00.127]  Yeah, well we've got to somehow reach out to the public.
[00:25:00.587 --> 00:25:10.712]  None of us are perfect, but we have been somewhat effective at waking a lot of people up, and then they can find more eloquent and refined folks like you, Daniel Esselstyn.
[00:25:10.752 --> 00:25:13.953]  We all do the best job we can, but I agree, the film is somewhat of a distortion.
[00:25:14.393 --> 00:25:16.794]  Overall, we're going to make lemonade out of these lemons.
[00:25:17.155 --> 00:25:19.516]  Daniel, we will talk to you again very, very soon.
[00:25:19.836 --> 00:25:22.177]  Godspeed and congratulations on all your success.
[00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:23.628]  Take care, Alex.
[00:25:24.369 --> 00:25:24.769]  Take care.
[00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:26.610]  There he goes from Spain, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.491]  Okay, John, go ahead and let him go.
[00:25:28.691 --> 00:25:29.031]  Thank you.
[00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:39.116]  Don't forget, folks, if you want to see the Bilderberg Group in living color, understand the master plan, in-game blueprint for global enslavement, this is the film to get in fullwars.com.
[00:25:39.136 --> 00:25:43.198]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:25:43.238 --> 00:25:47.640]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:25:50.865 --> 00:25:52.427]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:25:52.547 --> 00:25:57.133]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:25:57.294 --> 00:26:00.057]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:26:00.258 --> 00:26:03.121]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:26:03.302 --> 00:26:08.028]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:26:08.248 --> 00:26:09.169]  If you simply prepare.
[00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:12.371]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:19.537]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:26:19.617 --> 00:26:22.740]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:42.018]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:26:53.542 --> 00:26:55.444]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:55.944 --> 00:26:58.806]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:05.412 --> 00:27:06.072]  Big Brother.
[00:27:06.733 --> 00:27:07.814]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:08.494 --> 00:27:09.615]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:10.256 --> 00:27:11.076]  You want answers?
[00:27:11.817 --> 00:27:12.778]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:17.181]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:21.645]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:27.211]  Yeah, I, uh, just to finish up with the whole Daniel Esselstyn thing.
[00:27:28.992 --> 00:27:33.174]  What happens is... I learned a lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[00:27:33.194 --> 00:27:34.775]  You know, Daniel's really a very interesting guy.
[00:27:35.616 --> 00:27:42.800]  And I have a lot of connections and things, and so that's why two years ago he told me the people that bought the Terminator franchise were gonna make a major motion picture.
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.581]  It's gonna be along the lines of Angels and Demons.
[00:27:44.601 --> 00:27:46.643]  I mean, I don't, you know, a big thriller.
[00:27:47.683 --> 00:27:49.564]  Uh, that's what I've got scuttlebutt in Hollywood.
[00:27:49.604 --> 00:27:51.626]  I mean, I made some phone calls two years ago about this.
[00:27:52.206 --> 00:27:53.727]  And then I almost forgot about it.
[00:27:54.987 --> 00:28:04.951]  And then Daniel was going to come on about a week ago, and people were, you know, sending him stuff, sending him stuff off the forum, sending him people attacking him on the Prison Planet forum.
[00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:08.033]  You know, you know, we have forums, we have comments.
[00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:14.161]  But I own my websites, and it's my right to shut down stuff if I want to.
[00:28:14.261 --> 00:28:19.603]  I don't think I'm going to do it, but it's not censorship if I get rid of the message board and the comments.
[00:28:20.804 --> 00:28:33.470]  It's that I can't handle the Secret Service here twice, federal subpoenas twice from the FBI and federal courts that I'm gag-ordered to not talk about, people in black suits showing up,
[00:28:34.971 --> 00:28:38.152]  People creating fake posts on the thing that are supposedly for me.
[00:28:38.753 --> 00:28:44.056]  People, you know, taking a French newspaper saying Daniel Estelin was at Bilderberg with a fake list.
[00:28:44.336 --> 00:28:45.156]  Someone posted.
[00:28:45.797 --> 00:28:53.001]  And then even if Estelin's a smart guy and knows that we didn't post that, it still upsets, you know, most people.
[00:28:54.282 --> 00:28:58.463]  And then I talked to him yesterday for about 35 minutes and maybe 40 minutes.
[00:28:58.523 --> 00:29:01.343]  My wife's like, come on, we've got to go to my in-laws, you know, my family's.
[00:29:01.403 --> 00:29:04.684]  And I'm like, okay, I got to get off the phone, that's fine, but it was good talking to him.
[00:29:05.864 --> 00:29:06.644]  I learned a lot more.
[00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:14.886]  And, you know, I remember vaguely asking him two years ago, Seethink, with Seethink Productions, who are you interviewing for this?
[00:29:14.926 --> 00:29:17.526]  And they said, oh, we're interviewing Jack McClam, maybe.
[00:29:17.546 --> 00:29:18.247]  I hadn't talked to him yet.
[00:29:18.267 --> 00:29:19.647]  We're interviewing Luke Rudowsky.
[00:29:20.714 --> 00:29:22.114]  No, no, I recommended Likudowski.
[00:29:22.314 --> 00:29:28.676]  We're interviewing some guy in Florida, and we may interview Daniel Estillin.
[00:29:28.916 --> 00:29:32.097]  Well, now I learned they followed Estillin around off and on for two years.
[00:29:32.577 --> 00:29:35.078]  Because, I mean, I first met these guys in 2006 myself.
[00:29:35.698 --> 00:29:37.119]  Right after Bilderberg.
[00:29:37.139 --> 00:29:38.099]  Yeah, it was in the summer of 2006.
[00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:40.860]  It's 2009.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:45.381]  Three and a half, four years later, this is now coming out today, IFC, big premiere.
[00:29:47.582 --> 00:29:48.002]  And so,
[00:29:51.157 --> 00:29:53.198]  I can imagine the feelings Daniel was having.
[00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:56.320]  Number one, Present Planet Forum saying he's Bilderberg.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.120]  Totally made up.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:03.224]  I remember some idiot showed a dark-haired guy a photo from Bilderberg and said it was Charlie Sheen there.
[00:30:03.324 --> 00:30:04.865]  Obviously it wasn't Charlie Sheen.
[00:30:05.105 --> 00:30:07.186]  People do that and I've learned to ignore it.
[00:30:08.627 --> 00:30:11.148]  Daniel was saying, why are people interested in where I am or what I'm doing?
[00:30:11.168 --> 00:30:12.769]  Well, you're a public figure now, Daniel.
[00:30:13.982 --> 00:30:14.402]  You know that.
[00:30:14.442 --> 00:30:19.644]  You're on radio, you're on TV, you have a best-selling book all over the world, or 46 nations or whatever it says.
[00:30:20.044 --> 00:30:24.686]  I mean, you said there's going to be action figures of you at Burger King.
[00:30:25.086 --> 00:30:27.487]  Get ready for folks who want to know where you are and what you're doing.
[00:30:27.507 --> 00:30:29.488]  You know, this is how this works.
[00:30:30.508 --> 00:30:39.151]  But, you know, it's got to be a little bit bitter to have people follow you around for two years and then not
[00:30:40.134 --> 00:30:40.534]  Be in it.
[00:30:40.895 --> 00:30:44.459]  Even if it's a hit piece, somewhat, it's a waste of time.
[00:30:44.479 --> 00:30:48.843]  You know what it was like for a year to have Discovery Channel follow me around?
[00:30:48.863 --> 00:30:55.410]  And you know, have them with huge cameras in my car, ripping the upholstery and lights all over me and follow me around?
[00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.671]  It was a lot of work!
[00:30:57.432 --> 00:31:00.113]  And that was a good director, and he wouldn't make a hit piece on me.
[00:31:00.413 --> 00:31:05.134]  And they told him to go edit it and change it, and he said, well, I'll try, but I don't want to make Alex look bad.
[00:31:05.154 --> 00:31:07.155]  I mean, this was going to make us huge, folks.
[00:31:07.495 --> 00:31:13.357]  This was a huge five-part series for Discovery Channel with yours truly as the star.
[00:31:14.877 --> 00:31:16.558]  And they killed it.
[00:31:18.541 --> 00:31:20.664]  Yeah, he called me up and he said, you know, do you think I should do this?
[00:31:20.684 --> 00:31:26.313]  You know, they want me to interview this guy and this guy from Fox News and want me to interview all your enemies and are you game to do that?
[00:31:26.333 --> 00:31:31.742]  And I said, yeah, I don't want this to go to waste, you know, make it be two-sided, both sides.
[00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:34.915]  And then he called me back a week later and he just said, I can't do it.
[00:31:36.376 --> 00:31:37.076]  I'm not changing it.
[00:31:37.356 --> 00:31:39.458]  And that sucker went on the shelf.
[00:31:41.019 --> 00:31:43.481]  3.4 million dollar budget.
[00:31:43.941 --> 00:31:44.422]  On the shelf.
[00:31:44.682 --> 00:31:45.643]  So I know what it's like.
[00:31:46.824 --> 00:31:51.087]  But I'm not going to let people on the internet turn me and Daniel Esselstyn against each other.
[00:31:51.807 --> 00:31:55.330]  And I appreciated the plug he gave us on Press TV from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:56.431]  We love you, Daniel.
[00:31:56.911 --> 00:31:57.732]  Congratulations.
[00:31:58.232 --> 00:31:58.753]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:01.078 --> 00:32:09.446]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:32:09.707 --> 00:32:14.131]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[00:32:14.572 --> 00:32:19.737]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[00:33:00.588 --> 00:33:07.172]  A. In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:33:07.931 --> 00:33:13.274]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:33:13.815 --> 00:33:20.018]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:33:20.239 --> 00:33:22.120]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.681]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:33:24.741 --> 00:33:35.628]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.190]  It's not about left or right.
[00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:40.991]  It's about a one world government.
[00:33:41.451 --> 00:33:47.792]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:33:48.352 --> 00:33:56.134]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:56.614 --> 00:33:57.775]  The Obama Deception.
[00:33:58.195 --> 00:33:59.375]  The people strike back.
[00:34:01.067 --> 00:34:04.550]  Going into battle, you would want all the ammunition for your gun you could get.
[00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:08.053]  But presently, ammunition and reloading supplies are in shortage.
[00:34:08.454 --> 00:34:09.334]  Now think about this.
[00:34:09.935 --> 00:34:15.900]  If you have no food, all the guns and ammunition will be useless against the population control breadlines.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:20.324]  In the present battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is
[00:34:24.008 --> 00:34:24.088]  Yeah.
[00:34:40.816 --> 00:34:44.259]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:45.419]  How much will you need?
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.460]  We don't know.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.821]  How much do you want?
[00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:49.242]  All you can get.
[00:34:49.662 --> 00:34:51.584]  Storable food puts you in control.
[00:34:51.784 --> 00:34:52.064]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:34:52.104 --> 00:34:53.245]  On the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:34:53.285 --> 00:34:53.585]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:35:02.546 --> 00:35:08.572]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:12.216]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:23.787 --> 00:35:26.690]  You know, this whole New World Order premiere tonight,
[00:35:28.502 --> 00:35:32.344]  I get attacked almost every day by the mainstream media and I don't usually cover it.
[00:35:32.364 --> 00:35:38.647]  People always email me saying, why aren't you talking about this TV show or this local show or this radio show or this Washington Post article.
[00:35:39.687 --> 00:35:44.729]  You can Google the name Alex Jones any given day and click news and you'll see a hit piece against me.
[00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:46.990]  I love it.
[00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:48.591]  I absolutely love it.
[00:35:48.851 --> 00:35:50.192]  I just keep moving forward
[00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:56.899]  And you know, I've said I think the film is the most objective, most fair.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:04.004]  But I've also said that it stereotypes and it picked the few little corny things we did.
[00:36:08.567 --> 00:36:10.108]  So, the film is a distortion.
[00:36:10.148 --> 00:36:19.535]  The guys that made it know, sitting around, you know, eating popcorn, editing this thing, that they were choosing the most entertaining and hokey things, just for entertainment value alone.
[00:36:20.748 --> 00:36:23.698]  And you follow people around all these years, but with me, there's really nothing.
[00:36:26.325 --> 00:36:54.477]  discrediting other than i'm sweating in ninety five percent humidity in a hundred degree temperatures was so hot in that uh... june in virginia in a right off the coastline i mean everybody which is pouring sweat new york times that look at alex jones he's sweaty you know he's loud every stereotype yeah we're loud like the founding fathers or like george washington at trenton when he charged in against the hessians was he was he sweating was he yelling was he
[00:36:55.097 --> 00:36:56.778]  I mean, this is what we're supposed to do.
[00:36:56.818 --> 00:36:59.579]  They say, oh, you're not supposed to get excited, you're not supposed to get angry.
[00:36:59.919 --> 00:37:02.480]  Well, I like what Howard Beale said in Network.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.280]  You've got to get mad.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.641]  You've got to say, I'm a human being.
[00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:06.701]  My life has value.
[00:37:08.201 --> 00:37:13.443]  And they do show some guy who made a weird, you know, documentary about a police state in the future.
[00:37:13.623 --> 00:37:17.565]  Not even a documentary, a fiction film with cheesy special effects.
[00:37:17.905 --> 00:37:19.625]  Not knocking the guy, it's just that's what it shows.
[00:37:20.366 --> 00:37:21.986]  And he thinks he's got a microchip in his head.
[00:37:22.246 --> 00:37:23.487]  And that's guilt by association.
[00:37:23.527 --> 00:37:24.587]  They went out and chose that.
[00:37:26.432 --> 00:37:34.334]  And they show me in a hotel room, after I had the head of security in the hotel, with other men behind him in suits, walk up to Rob Jacobson.
[00:37:34.974 --> 00:37:48.997]  We need to put an article out about this, about, yes, New York Times, yes, Bloomberg, yes, LA Times, yes, there really was a Bilderberg Group meeting, there really were people in cars following us, they really did pull the fire alarm on us.
[00:37:49.917 --> 00:37:52.058]  I mean, these articles, in Bloomberg,
[00:37:54.022 --> 00:37:54.442]  Today.
[00:37:55.363 --> 00:37:57.343]  In the Los Angeles Times yesterday.
[00:37:57.783 --> 00:37:59.284]  In the New York Times last week.
[00:37:59.804 --> 00:38:01.325]  In Variety.com.
[00:38:02.085 --> 00:38:02.845]  That's right here.
[00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:05.726]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[00:38:06.047 --> 00:38:09.228]  There's LA Times for people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:09.548 --> 00:38:11.228]  Should have added, we've been on live since 11.30.
[00:38:12.929 --> 00:38:13.809]  There's Bloomberg.
[00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:19.311]  There's Washington Post.
[00:38:19.352 --> 00:38:19.992]  I mean, they're all here.
[00:38:20.032 --> 00:38:23.153]  The point is, is that
[00:38:27.628 --> 00:38:40.651]  You read these articles, and I don't have time to go over these, perhaps I should, and in each article they say Jones believed he was in a hotel surrounded by an imaginary group going insane when a fire alarm goes off.
[00:38:41.191 --> 00:38:45.573]  You know, showing how important he is, showing that there's really a cabal, showing this is proof.
[00:38:47.393 --> 00:38:49.233]  There was secret service around it.
[00:38:49.974 --> 00:38:51.774]  This is where Obama went at the secret meeting.
[00:38:51.814 --> 00:38:52.894]  I meant to bring that up to Estalin.
[00:38:53.214 --> 00:38:55.255]  Estalin, who really does know some Bilderberg Group members,
[00:38:58.089 --> 00:39:03.755]  He, I talked to him yesterday, I said, uh, you know, you confirmed Obama was there, correct?
[00:39:04.055 --> 00:39:05.056]  And he said, no, absolutely.
[00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:09.220]  So, I mean, he's on record that Obama was there.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.284]  And I've had mainstream news attack me, saying I'm crazy, saying Obama was there.
[00:39:13.664 --> 00:39:15.466]  Pretty fair piece, though, was done in Politico.
[00:39:15.566 --> 00:39:18.369]  I have to say, that one was a fair, actual journalistic piece.
[00:39:19.969 --> 00:39:22.270]  CBS News carried that on the nightly news, by the way.
[00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:23.470]  Very bizarre.
[00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.971]  So that's really one of the only fair pieces ever in U.S.
[00:39:27.051 --> 00:39:29.171]  media that admits all of this.
[00:39:29.232 --> 00:39:38.454]  Now, in the German news, the French news, the Russian news, the Japanese news, the British news, the Irish news, they admit, here's the Bilderberg Group, here's their founding documents that got leaked.
[00:39:38.694 --> 00:39:39.974]  They set up the European Union.
[00:39:40.014 --> 00:39:41.175]  They won a one-world government.
[00:39:41.495 --> 00:39:44.216]  They pick prime ministers and presidents.
[00:39:44.256 --> 00:39:45.156]  They're running the show.
[00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:50.078]  Their own documents, Etienne D'Avignon, the Viscount, the head of Bilderberg.
[00:39:50.498 --> 00:39:55.000]  He's in the EU Observer newspaper saying they run things.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.661]  You know, they write books saying it.
[00:39:56.701 --> 00:39:59.922]  David Rockefeller, four years ago, published his memoir saying it.
[00:40:00.302 --> 00:40:02.363]  Men in Power is a political retrospective.
[00:40:02.383 --> 00:40:04.444]  Helmut Schmidt brags Bilderberg runs the planet.
[00:40:05.464 --> 00:40:09.726]  And so I tried to give all of that to C-Think, but they didn't put it in the film.
[00:40:10.086 --> 00:40:11.207]  And that's what the news
[00:40:13.237 --> 00:40:20.799]  Bloomberg says, and the LA Times says, and Variety and everybody else say, with no proof, Jones claims they're building FEMA camps.
[00:40:21.799 --> 00:40:22.700]  That Halliburton is.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.880]  The film shows no proof.
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.260]  Well, I showed proof to them.
[00:40:26.581 --> 00:40:33.022]  I showed them the Houston Chronicle and the Washington Post and the New York Times about the FEMA camps.
[00:40:33.062 --> 00:40:33.902]  That's on record.
[00:40:33.922 --> 00:40:36.123]  I've had congressmen on about that.
[00:40:37.813 --> 00:40:40.596]  I've had congressmen on how they've been threatened with physical martial law.
[00:40:40.876 --> 00:40:45.820]  But Bloomberg just says that I made it up that Halliburton built FEMA camps.
[00:40:47.001 --> 00:40:49.424]  And they say I make it up that I'm being followed.
[00:40:50.489 --> 00:40:54.410]  Now, Jones insanely sees a car driving behind him on the highway and thinks it's the government.
[00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:59.191]  Folks, I was at Bilderberg with people following me as they closed it down at noon.
[00:40:59.651 --> 00:41:09.393]  I get in our car and cars and vans follow us off the property and take seven, eight, nine, ten turns, follow us into parking lots with, you know, big guys getting out.
[00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:10.433]  We shot video of it.
[00:41:11.214 --> 00:41:16.835]  I mean, this is just another version of what they've done all these years.
[00:41:17.933 --> 00:41:20.775]  Denying that the Bilderberg Group even existed.
[00:41:20.855 --> 00:41:30.343]  Now they have to admit it exists in all the mainstream news, but if they just report on this film, they can then say the film doesn't prove it exists.
[00:41:30.803 --> 00:41:34.646]  And I remember I kind of got in a big argument with the C-Think people and I said, you say this is objective.
[00:41:35.987 --> 00:41:42.533]  Well, I don't think it's objective, and I don't trust you, because you're not even saying there's even a Bilderberg Group meeting happening here this weekend.
[00:41:42.853 --> 00:41:47.357]  This is the day before Bilderberg arrived, and one of them was acting like it might not even exist.
[00:41:47.377 --> 00:41:50.399]  And I said, listen, pal, the Bilderberg Group exists.
[00:41:50.459 --> 00:41:50.720]  Stop.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:42:01.649]  I mean, this is so childlike that they're openly in the Time Magazine, Newsweek, hundreds of other major publications announcing world government is good, you'll pay carbon taxes to private bankers.
[00:42:03.189 --> 00:42:06.070]  And we have got these people denying it exists.
[00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.110]  And so, you know what?
[00:42:11.011 --> 00:42:26.474]  I welcome the fact that scores of mainstream news publications, the biggest in the country, some of the biggest in the world, New York Times, Washington Post, Variety, Bloomberg, are saying I'm crazy and none of this exists.
[00:42:26.994 --> 00:42:31.055]  Because people are going to watch the film The New World Order
[00:42:33.792 --> 00:42:34.192]  As the L.A.
[00:42:34.232 --> 00:42:40.137]  Times said, you know, that I'm quote, come off as charming, and that we make some points.
[00:42:40.197 --> 00:42:40.517]  The L.A.
[00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:42.079]  Times is the only half-fair one.
[00:42:43.059 --> 00:42:45.301]  It still goes with the same angle, but a little bit slicker.
[00:42:46.062 --> 00:42:48.844]  Kind of just dismisses this as people who mean well, but are nuts.
[00:42:50.404 --> 00:43:06.676]  People are going to read these articles, they're going to watch the film, and then they're going to Google Bilderberg, and they're going to see the world leaders and the kings and queens arriving, and they're going to read Bilderberg Group documents, and they're going to see everything we talk about unfolding, and they're going to go, well, the media lied to me again.
[00:43:06.937 --> 00:43:08.318]  The media started again.
[00:43:08.378 --> 00:43:09.799]  Remember the History Channel hit piece?
[00:43:10.159 --> 00:43:11.200]  That I knew was a hit piece.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.923]  When they called my office, I knew it was a hit piece.
[00:43:14.983 --> 00:43:18.045]  I had an argument with my producer about it.
[00:43:18.105 --> 00:43:19.086]  I said, no, this is a hit piece.
[00:43:21.113 --> 00:43:26.158]  And, but when it came out, they did everything they could to distort what I said, everything they could to make me look bad.
[00:43:26.418 --> 00:43:26.959]  It didn't matter.
[00:43:27.679 --> 00:43:29.741]  I talked to friends, I talked to family, I talked to everybody.
[00:43:30.222 --> 00:43:38.990]  That has woken up so many people who saw that show, saw how one-sided it was, went and, against us, went and looked it up and became 9-11 truthers.
[00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:43.835]  Because people instinctively know the mainstream media lies, spins, distorts.
[00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:53.490]  And that's why they're allowing half-decent films like New World Order to come out now because they've got to admit some of it's real to keep any of their credibility.
[00:43:54.071 --> 00:43:57.175]  I don't think the guys at C-Think are bad, but I'm not stupid.
[00:43:57.275 --> 00:43:58.357]  I know they made us look hokey.
[00:43:58.397 --> 00:44:00.981]  I know they distorted the film in a stereotypical way.
[00:44:01.001 --> 00:44:01.201]  What?
[00:44:01.461 --> 00:44:02.201]  That's fine!
[00:44:02.502 --> 00:44:04.762]  People are going to find out who the real Alex Jones is.
[00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:07.043]  They're going to find out who the real Luke Hradowski is.
[00:44:07.323 --> 00:44:09.264]  They're going to find out who we really are.
[00:44:09.304 --> 00:44:15.426]  They're going to go and they're going to look up Endgame and Terror Storm and Road to Tyranny and the Obama deception.
[00:44:17.697 --> 00:44:26.583]  So again, as everybody sees this C-Think film, I need articles up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com saying, hey, all you new people come to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:29.205]  Get Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:44:29.245 --> 00:44:30.586]  Find out who Alex Jones really is.
[00:44:30.826 --> 00:44:32.167]  Find out what he really has to say.
[00:44:32.187 --> 00:44:33.528]  See the full spectrum of his work.
[00:44:33.808 --> 00:44:37.431]  Find out who the elite are and what they have in store for you from their own documents.
[00:44:41.192 --> 00:44:51.358]  Because everything we talked about years ago, I called out Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffet, I called out Mr. Watson, the head of the Human Genome Project, as a Nazi, a year before!
[00:44:53.044 --> 00:44:54.786]  It came out that he said blacks weren't humans.
[00:44:54.846 --> 00:44:56.627]  The guy that ran the IBM Human Genome.
[00:44:57.448 --> 00:44:59.009]  The Nobel Prize winner for the double helix.
[00:44:59.349 --> 00:45:03.232]  Because I'd already read his writings, saying get rid of the majority of the population.
[00:45:03.473 --> 00:45:11.459]  He's one of the villains in Endgame, and a year after this came out, this came out two years ago, a year later, it comes out, everything I say.
[00:45:11.619 --> 00:45:13.261]  You think I just accused somebody?
[00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:16.864]  Unlike other people, if I accuse somebody of something, I got proof.
[00:45:18.114 --> 00:45:27.779]  You think I just get up here on air and say Bayer Pharmaceutical knowingly put HIV and Hepatitis in over a million ampoules, a factor-8, and knowingly shipped it out, knowing it would kill people, for eugenics?
[00:45:28.279 --> 00:45:29.620]  They were convicted in court of that.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.100]  It came out in their own internal documents.
[00:45:31.841 --> 00:45:39.004]  You see, when you see Endgame, you learn not only who the elite are, but what their entire global agenda is.
[00:45:39.364 --> 00:45:42.546]  This, more and more I realize, is the most important film I've made.
[00:45:43.567 --> 00:45:45.710]  And if you don't have this on DVD, you're insane.
[00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:47.071]  People need this.
[00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:48.293]  You need to have viewing parties.
[00:45:48.613 --> 00:45:50.775]  This needs to be the biggest, hottest film out there.
[00:45:50.896 --> 00:45:52.157]  It's huge, but not big enough.
[00:45:53.278 --> 00:45:55.761]  Obama deception is important, and it's for newbies.
[00:45:55.801 --> 00:45:57.703]  People say, well, I already know everything about Obama deception.
[00:45:57.944 --> 00:45:58.945]  That's the whole point!
[00:45:59.245 --> 00:46:03.290]  It's for people that don't understand the left-right paradigms of fraud, a distraction, a diversion.
[00:46:05.043 --> 00:46:06.264]  This film is so important.
[00:46:06.304 --> 00:46:07.364]  This cracks it all.
[00:46:07.444 --> 00:46:09.265]  And I already knew that my film was right.
[00:46:09.625 --> 00:46:13.087]  But the film gets more important as time goes on.
[00:46:13.347 --> 00:46:14.648]  It's more than evergreen.
[00:46:15.348 --> 00:46:17.509]  It isn't just staying evergreen.
[00:46:17.529 --> 00:46:19.310]  It's glowing now.
[00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:21.411]  It's putting off sparks now.
[00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:24.173]  It just gets more and more important.
[00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:27.376]  This, this is the Rosetta Stone.
[00:46:27.416 --> 00:46:29.097]  You want to decode everything.
[00:46:29.497 --> 00:46:31.197]  This is my encyclopedic work.
[00:46:31.578 --> 00:46:33.038]  All two hours and forty minutes of it.
[00:46:33.318 --> 00:46:35.799]  You watch this, you got a handle on everything.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.540]  This is the film, end game.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.821]  You see the UN building on the cover with that skull?
[00:46:41.241 --> 00:46:42.282]  That's what it's all about.
[00:46:43.102 --> 00:46:45.143]  You see all those flagpoles with no flags on them?
[00:46:45.443 --> 00:46:46.363]  That's what it's all about.
[00:46:46.503 --> 00:46:47.384]  The end of sovereignty.
[00:46:48.044 --> 00:46:49.424]  And I've committed my life to this.
[00:46:49.465 --> 00:46:50.105]  Am I perfect?
[00:46:50.145 --> 00:46:50.285]  No.
[00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:52.991]  But I'm taking action.
[00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:54.792]  I'm doing the best job I can.
[00:46:55.932 --> 00:46:57.033]  And the critics be damned.
[00:46:57.653 --> 00:46:58.334]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:58.394 --> 00:46:59.534]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:59.575 --> 00:47:01.075]  Tons of financial news and a lot more.

[00:48:01.033 --> 00:48:07.238]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:48:07.698 --> 00:48:15.464]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:48:15.824 --> 00:48:23.690]  Is this a flaw free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:28.734]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:48:29.062 --> 00:48:33.784]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:48:34.284 --> 00:48:38.146]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:48:38.627 --> 00:48:39.647]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:48:39.727 --> 00:48:43.809]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:48:44.229 --> 00:48:48.611]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:48:49.131 --> 00:48:51.693]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:48:57.466 --> 00:48:59.828]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:00.849 --> 00:49:06.173]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:49:06.673 --> 00:49:13.639]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:49:14.224 --> 00:49:20.408]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:49:20.428 --> 00:49:22.650]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.212]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:49:25.292 --> 00:49:36.239]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.161]  It's not about left or right.
[00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:39.902]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:49:40.385 --> 00:49:46.750]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:49:55.577 --> 00:49:56.718]  The Obama Deception.
[00:49:57.139 --> 00:49:58.340]  The people strike back.
[00:50:00.259 --> 00:50:00.799]  You worry.
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.021]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:50:03.301 --> 00:50:03.562]  Hi.
[00:50:03.842 --> 00:50:06.324]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:50:06.624 --> 00:50:10.867]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:50:11.168 --> 00:50:13.349]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:16.672]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:50:16.992 --> 00:50:18.713]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:50:18.913 --> 00:50:21.435]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:50:21.715 --> 00:50:25.158]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:50:25.418 --> 00:50:29.520]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:33.623]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:50:33.943 --> 00:50:39.947]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:50:40.268 --> 00:50:42.429]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:50:42.629 --> 00:50:44.270]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[00:50:47.193 --> 00:50:48.916]  888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:50:49.397 --> 00:50:50.039]  Start now.
[00:50:50.299 --> 00:50:51.241]  Knowledge is power.
[00:50:52.023 --> 00:50:52.824]  Better take action.
[00:50:53.025 --> 00:50:53.967]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:51:25.834 --> 00:51:27.536]  Man, I tell you, no rest for the wicked.
[00:51:27.556 --> 00:51:34.522]  I was just on 93.7 KLBJ with Charlie Hodge for my weekly Freedom Nugget during that four-minute break, during the long break we do once an hour.
[00:51:35.823 --> 00:51:45.231]  Okay, I want to break down the economy, I want to break down what's actually happening, the police state, and then later, I'll do this at two, after Kevin Trudeau leaves us.
[00:51:45.312 --> 00:51:46.993]  So I found out it's a big fan of Prison Planet.
[00:51:47.373 --> 00:51:49.836]  TV subscriber, how crazy is that?
[00:51:50.871 --> 00:51:54.474]  We actually got contacted through their folks, so I look forward to having him on.
[00:51:54.734 --> 00:51:58.397]  And then Billionaire Club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[00:51:58.437 --> 00:52:04.663]  America's richest people meet to discuss ways of tackling a disastrous environmental, social, and industrial threat.
[00:52:04.883 --> 00:52:08.426]  The group told the Times of London to call them the Good Group.
[00:52:09.026 --> 00:52:10.047]  The Good Witch.
[00:52:10.347 --> 00:52:11.668]  Glinda the Good Witch.
[00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:17.240]  When the moon comes up, they go, he he he he, and turn into the bad witch.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:29.850]  And in this article it says, why did all the secrecy, they wanted to speak rich to rich without worrying, anything they said would end up in the newspapers, painting them as alternative world government.
[00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:34.714]  Because see, there's a world government, they don't want to be known as the alternative world government.
[00:52:35.748 --> 00:52:44.251]  See, they love these little flippant comments that they think the slaves won't get the subtlety to because they've dumbed down the language so much, as Daniel Esselstyn was talking about earlier.
[00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:49.553]  So, we're going to go over that and how it ties in with Meeting of America's Richest.
[00:52:51.854 --> 00:52:53.994]  ABC News lied last week and didn't tell the truth.
[00:52:54.014 --> 00:52:55.555]  They said it was about helping the poor.
[00:52:55.915 --> 00:52:57.836]  I guess killing them means helping them.
[00:52:58.376 --> 00:53:01.597]  ABC News reports on Secret Meeting of the Rich, yet ignores Bilderberg completely.
[00:53:03.052 --> 00:53:05.134]  The rich get tougher.
[00:53:05.794 --> 00:53:06.595]  It was a secret.
[00:53:07.096 --> 00:53:08.377]  That's out of the New York Times.
[00:53:08.937 --> 00:53:09.538]  Then who?
[00:53:10.058 --> 00:53:13.041]  World Health Organization urges hospitals to join climate change battle.
[00:53:13.381 --> 00:53:15.483]  You can't have these expensive nice hospitals.
[00:53:15.543 --> 00:53:16.404]  It's bad for the earth.
[00:53:17.004 --> 00:53:17.425]  Literally.
[00:53:17.465 --> 00:53:18.085]  That's Reuters.
[00:53:18.786 --> 00:53:20.327]  Queensland fluoride overdose.
[00:53:20.828 --> 00:53:22.089]  Info wrong again.
[00:53:22.129 --> 00:53:23.890]  The government put too much fluoride in the water.
[00:53:25.492 --> 00:53:25.872]  Too much.
[00:53:25.932 --> 00:53:26.452]  Any of it's bad.
[00:53:26.512 --> 00:53:37.681]  I have all these articles where John Hopkins and the Mayo Clinic and others report that you're 2.9 times more likely to get sick and die of the flu or go to the hospital if you take the flu shot.
[00:53:38.301 --> 00:53:39.822]  Of course, that's just the Mayo Clinic.
[00:53:39.862 --> 00:53:40.523]  Don't listen to them.
[00:53:41.584 --> 00:53:45.707]  So we'll be going over all of that because it's so important coming up.
[00:53:47.632 --> 00:53:49.294]  Ron Paul joins us every four weeks.
[00:53:49.334 --> 00:53:52.096]  He's scheduled to be joining us next week sometime.
[00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:55.419]  We're nailing that down because his schedule is so fluid.
[00:53:56.259 --> 00:53:59.622]  But when he gets on, it's now over 180 sponsors.
[00:53:59.682 --> 00:54:00.382]  Last Friday, it was 179.
[00:54:00.663 --> 00:54:02.084]  It's over 180.
[00:54:02.824 --> 00:54:04.166]  We're nailing down those final numbers.
[00:54:04.186 --> 00:54:04.946]  This is very exciting.
[00:54:05.567 --> 00:54:12.853]  But what's freaking me out is, and it's got to be Cohen Telpro, or just the mass mental illness out there on the internet that Desmond was talking about, and I have noticed,
[00:54:13.936 --> 00:54:17.278]  There were hundreds and hundreds of comments on the article Kurt Nemo wrote Saturday.
[00:54:17.358 --> 00:54:20.739]  The guy's working seven days a week, because he's got such passion.
[00:54:20.919 --> 00:54:22.100]  He doesn't have to, he just does.
[00:54:23.681 --> 00:54:34.186]  And he wrote an article about this, and I appreciate him doing that, and there were hundreds of comments, and about half of them were saying, oh, this is just a setup to get rid of the Fed and set up a new global system.
[00:54:34.846 --> 00:54:37.668]  Oh, they'll never get the audit, there's no point.
[00:54:38.499 --> 00:54:40.501]  I mean, just defeatist attitude.
[00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:42.604]  No, the Fed doesn't want to be audited.
[00:54:42.924 --> 00:54:45.987]  The Fed has said it's above the law and can't be audited, which is kind of like a trick.
[00:54:46.027 --> 00:54:48.330]  It's saying, don't shoot me, I'm bulletproof.
[00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:49.992]  And you shoot the person and they're not bulletproof.
[00:54:50.833 --> 00:54:52.835]  You know, I mean, it's a mind game.
[00:54:55.117 --> 00:54:57.720]  Or it's like somebody pouring gasoline on themselves and saying, I can't burn.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.042]  You throw a match to them, they will burn.
[00:55:00.236 --> 00:55:02.618]  You know, that's my little parable about the Federal Reserve.
[00:55:02.998 --> 00:55:04.539]  No, they don't want to be audited.
[00:55:04.879 --> 00:55:06.561]  Ron Paul gets all sorts of death threats.
[00:55:06.601 --> 00:55:08.362]  He has admitted he's in danger doing this.
[00:55:08.642 --> 00:55:11.824]  Ron Paul is the real deal, and he's a symbol of liberty and freedom.
[00:55:12.025 --> 00:55:13.306]  That's why they tried to destroy him.
[00:55:13.546 --> 00:55:18.149]  They couldn't destroy him, so now they're trying to co-opt his message, and it's not working for him either.
[00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:20.951]  They know we're the majority.
[00:55:20.971 --> 00:55:27.496]  They know that we're waking up, and he's a figurehead, an intelligent, dynamic figurehead, but all of us that are prominent are figureheads.
[00:55:29.548 --> 00:55:35.379]  And they're probably building him up to later try to destroy him, but he's so gentlemanly and so calm and focused, it's very hard for them to do, though they've tried.
[00:55:36.716 --> 00:55:43.718]  So, they know that the majority of activist groups on campuses are now patriots, slash Ron Paul, slash Infowarriors.
[00:55:44.278 --> 00:55:46.398]  They know that we're rising.
[00:55:47.099 --> 00:55:52.840]  And, you know, that's what Bilderberg, it came out two years ago, and I got confirmed this from Estalin and Tucker, were really worried about Paul.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.240]  And they're more worried today.
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:57.181]  And they're worried about us and the state sovereignty movement.
[00:55:57.381 --> 00:55:59.842]  So they spin it as states want to violently secede.
[00:56:00.362 --> 00:56:05.223]  No, we're declaring our 9th and 10th amendments saying the feds aren't over the states in every issue.
[00:56:06.568 --> 00:56:07.309]  10th and 9th Amendment.
[00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.610]  Read it!
[00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:10.054]  So they always want to radicalize things.
[00:56:10.855 --> 00:56:13.199]  And there's all these solutions, but for everybody out there...
[00:56:14.198 --> 00:56:19.442]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Federal Reserve is the regional arm of the global banking system.
[00:56:19.482 --> 00:56:21.924]  We need to audit it and expose it and go after it.
[00:56:22.144 --> 00:56:25.246]  Then the other spin is, well, it's already been audited.
[00:56:25.386 --> 00:56:31.631]  No, they passed a law to audit how many desks it has, how many pencils it has, but not the money or where the money goes or what they do with it.
[00:56:31.831 --> 00:56:35.634]  And the Federal Reserve's on record in front of Congress saying, we're not going to tell you where the money went.
[00:56:35.894 --> 00:56:39.297]  So anybody saying that they tell you where the money goes is a liar.
[00:56:40.157 --> 00:56:45.139]  So, let's get positive here and move forward, or at least ignore the disinformation agents.
[00:56:45.419 --> 00:56:49.481]  This is a positive thing to audit the Fed to point out that it's never been audited.
[00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:51.162]  That's positive in and of itself.
[00:56:51.362 --> 00:56:52.262]  We're on the march.
[00:56:52.763 --> 00:56:54.363]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:55.304 --> 00:56:57.965]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.782 --> 00:57:02.344]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:02.464 --> 00:57:07.050]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.973]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:57:10.173 --> 00:57:13.037]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:57:13.217 --> 00:57:17.943]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:57:18.143 --> 00:57:19.084]  If you simply prepare.
[00:57:19.284 --> 00:57:22.247]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:57:22.527 --> 00:57:29.433]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:57:29.533 --> 00:57:32.656]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:57:32.796 --> 00:57:34.478]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[00:57:38.001 --> 00:57:40.962]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:07.788 --> 00:58:13.132]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:58:13.673 --> 00:58:19.857]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:20.177 --> 00:58:21.979]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:22.139 --> 00:58:24.541]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:35.489]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:58:37.779 --> 00:58:39.040]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.842]  It's about a one world government.
[00:58:41.302 --> 00:58:47.667]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:48.228 --> 00:58:56.014]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:56.495 --> 00:58:57.635]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:58.056 --> 00:58:59.237]  The people strike back.
[00:59:00.759 --> 00:59:05.062]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:59:05.283 --> 00:59:07.684]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:59:07.845 --> 00:59:17.312]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:59:17.312 --> 00:59:17.912]  We're good to go.
[00:59:36.223 --> 00:59:36.824]  I think so.
[01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:12.208]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:12.248 --> 01:00:17.733]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:00:26.328 --> 01:00:30.291]  Never had him on the show, Kevin Trudeau, coming up in about 27 minutes from now.
[01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:33.013]  Best-selling author, king of the infomercials.
[01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:35.434]  Turned out he's a fan of the show, PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:00:36.255 --> 01:00:41.158]  Months ago, tried to get in touch with me through ManCow, Mueller, and then I was so busy, never got in touch with him.
[01:00:41.558 --> 01:00:48.883]  But we did, and that should be interesting, to talk about a host of issues with Kevin Trudeau, coming up in T-minus 26 minutes.
[01:00:48.943 --> 01:00:49.644]  Very, very excited.
[01:00:49.664 --> 01:00:51.085]  Because I like a lot of what he does.
[01:00:51.105 --> 01:00:52.666]  That's why the media and the government demonize him.
[01:00:53.919 --> 01:00:58.301]  How dare him sell a book saying aloe vera is good for burns, or that cranberries are good for your kidneys.
[01:00:58.361 --> 01:01:02.222]  I mean, I read his super bestsellers, sold millions of copies.
[01:01:02.843 --> 01:01:03.543]  Herbal Remedies.
[01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:09.085]  And I mean, it's mainline, the stuff that's, you know, garlic's good for your heart, your immune system.
[01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.826]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[01:01:11.166 --> 01:01:12.947]  That is coming up with Kevin Trudeau.
[01:01:13.767 --> 01:01:18.449]  And we got Judith McGeary coming on here with us in just a moment.
[01:01:18.769 --> 01:01:22.651]  Before I do that, I want to encourage everybody, if you want to know what the National
[01:01:23.311 --> 01:01:24.112]  We're good to go.
[01:01:40.243 --> 01:01:41.645]  Very, very important information.
[01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:46.289]  Be sure to get the Obama Deception and Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement at Infowars.com.
[01:01:46.649 --> 01:01:50.153]  Our call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.435]  Again, that number is 888-253-3139.
[01:01:52.455 --> 01:02:01.023]  Not only do you get films that you're authorized to make copies of for non-profit educational purposes, you fund our operation that is very, very expensive for us to run.
[01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:04.289]  And I spend most of my time trying to raise the capital to pay for all the bandwidth.
[01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:08.977]  Also, we've launched 12 new t-shirts with Patriot messages.
[01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:12.042]  In fact, punch that up from PrisonPlanet.tv for folks.
[01:02:13.274 --> 01:02:14.875]  People keep asking, how do I network?
[01:02:15.016 --> 01:02:20.140]  You wear a Live Free or Die, Minuteman shirt, you're going to meet like-minded people walking down the street or at church.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.244]  You wear a Minuteman, Culpepper shirt, you're going to meet like-minded people.
[01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:38.055]  You wear a Obama-Bush shirt that says, Worst President Ever Until Now, with split views of both presidents' heads, that will wake up the left and the right, because both the left and the right are going to hate somebody on your shirt.
[01:02:38.276 --> 01:02:39.256]  The left's going to hate Bush,
[01:02:40.518 --> 01:02:43.722]  The right's gonna hate Obama and you can explain to them they're being played.
[01:02:44.002 --> 01:02:45.744]  Says on the back of the shirt, don't be a sucker.
[01:02:46.145 --> 01:02:49.409]  Got the very best seller, the come and take it flag, dealing with the Second Amendment.
[01:02:51.071 --> 01:02:54.555]  So again, InfoWars.com to order the t-shirts.

[01:03:06.513 --> 01:03:07.774]  You need to let folks see your colors.
[01:03:08.374 --> 01:03:16.537]  And if Homeland Security doesn't like Minutemen, doesn't like Founding Fathers, doesn't like Culpeper flags that half the military uses, that's just their problem.
[01:03:16.858 --> 01:03:18.478]  We're going to go to our guest here in just one moment.
[01:03:18.558 --> 01:03:24.721]  One more sponsor I wanted to tell all of the listeners about is HomeGain.
[01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:27.984]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[01:03:28.264 --> 01:03:29.526]  Check them out and see what I'm talking about.

[01:03:41.159 --> 01:03:43.080]  They've got a whole bunch of great free features.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:50.725]  They've got my favorite, the Home Sale Maximizer, to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:54.968]  Check out Max's little orange gorilla on InfoWars.com and PrisonPilot.com.
[01:03:55.188 --> 01:04:00.011]  And that links through to H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:01.692]  HomeGain.com.
[01:04:02.632 --> 01:04:13.956]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Judith McGeary, Farm and Ranch Freedom Alliance, and we really do appreciate her joining us.
[01:04:14.797 --> 01:04:20.759]  And, you know, for folks that don't know who this organization is or don't care about farms and ranches, listen up.
[01:04:20.819 --> 01:04:21.920]  This affects everybody.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.081]  This is the corporate control grid that is taking place.
[01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:30.383]  Judith, tell us about the organization and your position there for folks that may not know about that.
[01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.402]  Thanks so much for having me on, Alex.
[01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:34.363]  I appreciate it.
[01:04:34.383 --> 01:04:35.704]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:04:36.784 --> 01:04:44.850]  Our organization was founded about three and a half years ago when I left my legal practice and got together with a group of other farmers and ranchers to create it.
[01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:59.499]  And the idea is that we need a food supply that is provided by small, independent farmers scattered all over this country, rather than this huge corporate monopoly that we're rapidly heading towards for our food.
[01:04:59.861 --> 01:05:02.062]  Which is a basic necessity of life for everybody.
[01:05:03.122 --> 01:05:11.625]  Well, we have the United Nations Population Fund meeting back in 1996 in Beijing, China, and they said, we will use food as a weapon.
[01:05:12.626 --> 01:05:16.507]  And they said, we're going to take control of the world's heirloom seeds, their food supplies.
[01:05:16.767 --> 01:05:21.409]  We're going to have pharmacological crops that make you take the vaccines every time you eat.
[01:05:22.249 --> 01:05:24.790]  People don't know they can engineer that into the crops to grow whatever
[01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:27.512]  Mind-altering chemical or vaccine they want.
[01:05:27.852 --> 01:05:30.053]  They're trying to force the world to take on GMO.
[01:05:30.453 --> 01:05:36.598]  They're trying to make a chicken farmer put a $20 tag on a $5 chicken, but then Tyson and others are exempt.
[01:05:36.798 --> 01:05:38.919]  They have group tags for every couple hundred chickens.
[01:05:39.339 --> 01:05:42.622]  They want you to waive your rights for those that don't know the premises ID.
[01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:44.943]  And this is all color of law.
[01:05:45.664 --> 01:05:53.089]  I've also read they're buying off the farm and ranch groups giving a millions of dollars even local chapters to then intimidate their members into doing it.
[01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:54.109]  They're arresting
[01:05:55.430 --> 01:06:02.324]  As publicity stunts all over the country at the county fair, you'll have the champion pig, or horse, or goat, or steer.
[01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:04.228]  And they do this on purpose, I've read.
[01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:07.870]  Where they'll always do it to the person they pick as the winner.
[01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:10.952]  Then they'll say, oh, sorry on stage, you don't get the blue ribbon now.
[01:06:11.532 --> 01:06:15.814]  Then they have the police take you off ground saying you hadn't registered your premises.
[01:06:16.294 --> 01:06:18.455]  It's not law, but it's the policy.
[01:06:18.695 --> 01:06:22.937]  So they're creating a giant hoax that it's illegal and you've got to do this.
[01:06:23.217 --> 01:06:25.438]  Just like there's a hoax you've got to take vaccines.
[01:06:25.598 --> 01:06:27.339]  Judith, you're the expert on this.
[01:06:27.379 --> 01:06:28.179]  Break it down for us.
[01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:33.784]  Well, the sad thing is, actually, it takes a lot less than that to intimidate most people.
[01:06:34.164 --> 01:06:39.468]  The sad truth is, they're giving a few hundred thousand out, and they're kicking people out before they ever get to the stage.
[01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:44.111]  And people are far too quick to fall in line, is the sad reality.
[01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:58.680]  What they're talking about is that anyone who owns even one livestock or poultry animal, and this includes anybody out there who wants to raise their own food, who's been looking into the idea of having an independent food source, either that they raise or that they get from their neighbors,
[01:06:59.295 --> 01:06:59.575]  I don't know.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:41.875]  And they admit, I should add, it started in Australia, as you know, they're now using the Homeland Security NSA military satellites dialed into the land management people, so folks who live in Utah and other places, or Colorado, where you get harassed by the bureaucrats on your private property, that's now coming to Texas, Kansas, Michigan, Florida, it doesn't matter, and we're not joking, they're forming SWAT teams in all these federal and state groups, they're pulling guns on people at their own ponds, fishing,
[01:07:42.535 --> 01:07:46.959]  They're arresting Amish people, you know, arresting people selling eggs on street corners.
[01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:49.761]  They've introduced bills to restrict organic farming.
[01:07:50.822 --> 01:07:54.746]  In Tulsa, Oklahoma, they're talking about making you get a license to have a home garden.
[01:07:55.046 --> 01:07:56.227]  That was in the Tulsa News.
[01:07:56.267 --> 01:08:05.255]  I mean, you cannot paint a strong enough picture of how evil and insidious all of this is.
[01:08:05.315 --> 01:08:08.998]  I hope the listeners understand, this is coming down like a ton of bricks right now.
[01:08:10.265 --> 01:08:11.746]  It's gaining speed fast.
[01:08:11.766 --> 01:08:14.687]  I mean, these are plants that they've been working on for literally decades.
[01:08:15.147 --> 01:08:16.128]  You know, it's not new.
[01:08:16.208 --> 01:08:19.610]  It's not because of mad cow disease or avian flu or swine flu.
[01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:22.351]  You know, depending on who you talk to, they come up with a new reason.
[01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:27.133]  These plants have been around for decades, but they're really gathering steam now.
[01:08:27.333 --> 01:08:32.796]  And there are a lot of folks in Congress who are bound and determined to shove this down our throat.
[01:08:33.677 --> 01:08:36.598]  And they're working very hard to create this image of panic.
[01:08:37.188 --> 01:08:39.629]  Which is, if we don't have this, people will be dying.
[01:08:39.929 --> 01:08:48.273]  At a recent correctional hearing, one of the chairmen of the subcommittees was literally saying that, you know, if we can't track this better, people will be dying when this food hits their face.
[01:08:48.293 --> 01:08:50.134]  But then the foreign food is exempt.
[01:08:50.414 --> 01:08:51.875]  The foreign food is exempt.
[01:08:52.135 --> 01:08:54.696]  So if people think we've already seen an exodus of U.S.
[01:08:54.756 --> 01:09:00.039]  produced food, we've gone from producing 98% of our food to, what, half of it now, and it's going down.
[01:09:00.559 --> 01:09:08.421]  In fact, I should add, and I'm rude, Judith Amagiri is Executive Director of the Farm and Ranch Freedom Alliance, is an attorney and small farmer, a B.S.
[01:09:08.461 --> 01:09:11.341]  in biology from Stanford University, and a J.D.
[01:09:11.361 --> 01:09:12.742]  from the University of Texas at Austin.
[01:09:13.642 --> 01:09:21.443]  And after a clerkship with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, she practices as an attorney, doing a combination of administrative law, litigation, and appeals.
[01:09:21.503 --> 01:09:23.844]  So I should add, you're an expert on all this as well.
[01:09:25.244 --> 01:09:28.805]  Well, the thing is, you know, the real expertise comes from handling animals.
[01:09:29.454 --> 01:09:36.756]  The real expertise, you know, it comes from the day-to-day, knowing what it takes to raise food, knowing what it takes to keep animals healthy.
[01:09:37.677 --> 01:09:58.944]  And what's amazing to me about this program and about the mentality and the mindset of the people pushing it is this attitude that somehow folks who are locked in an office who wouldn't know one end of the cow from the other somehow can come up with a technological answer that solves everything and takes care of animal health, while the farmers and ranchers obviously don't know anything, you know, according to these guys.
[01:09:59.554 --> 01:10:07.216]  Well, let me just throw a point out here, and then I want to give you the floor and have you break down how far along this is, how we fight it, how we, you know, go up against it.
[01:10:07.876 --> 01:10:26.722]  We have a large piece of property we got in 1829 as a Mexican land grant in East Texas, and I don't even really deer hunt anymore because I don't have the time, don't want to have to dress it, deal with it, but every time I'm out with a telescope at night in the front yard of Grandma's old house once a year, you know, trying to look at Saturn,
[01:10:28.573 --> 01:10:30.415]  Rolling up without lights is a game warden.
[01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:32.757]  They jump out, they're rude to you, they boss you around.
[01:10:32.777 --> 01:10:36.341]  When I was a little kid out there, you'd see them every once in a while and they were polite.
[01:10:36.842 --> 01:10:39.364]  Now they treat you like you're a piece of filth as a landowner.
[01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:43.869]  Now they're popping up everywhere harassing people and they're getting federal training.
[01:10:43.889 --> 01:10:50.496]  Now to get a hunting or fishing license, they run your background, they run your driver's license, everything's a tracking control grid.
[01:10:50.976 --> 01:11:11.770]  This is going to put federally controlled local bureaucrats into your farm, checking things without a warrant, with game warden type powers, no more Fourth Amendment, walking on, saying, I want to see all your cows counted right now, $2,000 fines, and correct me if I'm going from memory, I know you're a lawyer and expert on this,
[01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:18.553]  If a cow got struck by lightning and you didn't report it to them, or you sold a cow to a neighbor, or a cow got out and got hit by a car.
[01:11:18.873 --> 01:11:24.216]  I mean, this is guilty until proven innocent tyranny over all rural communities.
[01:11:25.596 --> 01:11:26.197]  Absolutely.
[01:11:26.257 --> 01:11:31.139]  The specific fines vary from state to state because they're talking about implementing it by state statute.
[01:11:31.659 --> 01:11:35.181]  Here in Texas, it's $1,000 per day would be the maximum fine.
[01:11:36.281 --> 01:11:40.123]  In Wisconsin, they're currently prosecuting Amish farmers, charging them $5,000.
[01:11:43.163 --> 01:11:49.746]  Yeah, they're even forcing the Amish in.
[01:11:49.766 --> 01:11:49.746]  20,000.
[01:11:50.066 --> 01:11:51.847]  They're even forcing the Amish in.
[01:11:52.047 --> 01:11:54.608]  Okay, break down this horror, how bad it is.
[01:11:54.668 --> 01:11:57.769]  This affects everybody who's rural, and then everybody who lives in the cities.
[01:11:58.089 --> 01:12:02.911]  This is literal... Stalin did this in Ukraine, kicking people off the land and controlling it.
[01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.411]  I mean, China does this.
[01:12:04.451 --> 01:12:05.512]  This is hardcore.
[01:12:05.832 --> 01:12:06.892]  Pol Pot did this.
[01:12:06.952 --> 01:12:08.373]  I mean, this is hardcore.
[01:12:08.413 --> 01:12:08.793]  Go ahead.
[01:12:10.061 --> 01:12:16.383]  Well, the thing is, in practical terms, it means that almost no one will be able to raise food animals.
[01:12:17.444 --> 01:12:18.964]  The big corporations will be able to.
[01:12:19.044 --> 01:12:22.926]  They get group identification actually for thousands of animals.
[01:12:23.366 --> 01:12:31.109]  They can take one of those huge horrific chicken farms that has, you know, 10,000 or 20,000 birds crammed into a building and give it one ID number.
[01:12:32.109 --> 01:12:36.831]  And yet, small farmers or anyone trying to raise any kind of food animal, or pets even,
[01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:38.031]  Absolutely.
[01:12:38.371 --> 01:12:39.913]  I mean, Tyson's been hit deep in this.
[01:12:58.431 --> 01:12:59.992]  Um, all of the big corporations have.
[01:13:00.012 --> 01:13:07.977]  And of course, they claim it's food safety and they pretend that they're providing safe food, when the reality is it's the small farmers who you want for your safe food supply.
[01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:08.858]  Unbelievable.
[01:13:08.898 --> 01:13:15.502]  And the thing they get is it's so expensive, because you're talking electronic tags, and they're talking about all the infrastructure that comes with it.
[01:13:15.582 --> 01:13:21.025]  So, scanners and computers and internets and readers and everything else that comes with it.
[01:13:21.645 --> 01:13:27.329]  Um, and keep in mind, the last census said that 48% of farmers don't even have any internet.
[01:13:28.454 --> 01:13:36.116]  Can you imagine having chickens and a game warden type punk in a uniform, but they're hiring nothing but the socialist and phony environmentalist?
[01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:38.817]  Carbon showing up and literally cornering you.
[01:13:39.117 --> 01:13:40.557]  You got five chickens right here.
[01:13:40.577 --> 01:13:41.558]  You're going to jail.
[01:13:41.958 --> 01:13:43.418]  Here's a $20,000 fine.
[01:13:44.318 --> 01:13:47.159]  This is already happening.
[01:13:47.779 --> 01:13:48.439]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:13:48.459 --> 01:13:49.600]  It just makes me so angry.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.341]  It should make all of us angry.
[01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:57.482]  I have to sort of learn not to go crazy over it, because otherwise I'd have been locked up about three years ago.
[01:13:58.394 --> 01:13:58.955]  We're going to beat them.
[01:13:59.115 --> 01:13:59.575]  Keep going.
[01:14:00.376 --> 01:14:01.337]  We have to beat them.
[01:14:01.657 --> 01:14:08.223]  Because the reality is, if you can't afford to raise food animals, then you stop raising them.
[01:14:08.663 --> 01:14:11.426]  And the reality for a lot of people, then, is they lose their land.
[01:14:11.606 --> 01:14:17.591]  Because if you can't, if you aren't an ag business, you lose your ag valuation on the land, and you can't afford property taxes.
[01:14:17.892 --> 01:14:21.175]  Which, if you don't know, I was looking at a piece of property, and
[01:14:22.594 --> 01:14:27.775]  If it already has an ag exemption, you can go to environmental, you know, preserve.
[01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:32.836]  But once you get land and go to environmental, you can't ever go back.
[01:14:33.517 --> 01:14:36.197]  And they admit they don't want people farming.
[01:14:36.237 --> 01:14:38.798]  They're paying people to not farm.
[01:14:38.838 --> 01:14:39.198]  Go ahead.
[01:14:40.478 --> 01:14:43.459]  And so what we'll end up with is a lot of people losing their land.
[01:14:43.959 --> 01:14:49.280]  Even more, even if they find another option like the environmental exemptions or environmental valuations.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.101]  Many people stopping raising animals for food.
[01:14:52.871 --> 01:14:56.654]  And so your only options start becoming the Tysons and the Cargill.
[01:14:57.114 --> 01:15:03.718]  We'll have a food supply that is already far too controlled by these companies that will be entirely controlled by these companies.
[01:15:03.818 --> 01:15:04.319]  Unbelievable.
[01:15:04.499 --> 01:15:10.843]  And, you know, at a minimum, what we're talking about is increased cost, lower quality, the sort of things you find in any monopoly.
[01:15:11.123 --> 01:15:13.044]  That's the best case scenario.
[01:15:13.424 --> 01:15:13.705]  Unbelievable.
[01:15:13.725 --> 01:15:17.787]  In this scenario, it goes downhill from there, because food is what you need to survive.
[01:15:18.268 --> 01:15:20.249]  And we don't want to have to be dependent on
[01:15:20.839 --> 01:15:24.560]  Multinational Corporation for basic necessity of life.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:28.381]  And then they can force you to buy their GMO products.
[01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:37.223]  And I'm sure you've seen accompanying this, your lawyer, the bill they've got introduced to basically crack down and restrict organic farming.
[01:15:37.643 --> 01:15:39.623]  I mean, I mean, this is getting wild.
[01:15:40.524 --> 01:15:46.245]  They're actually, the scary thing is there are about six bills in Congress right now, all under the heading of food safety.
[01:15:46.869 --> 01:15:55.951]  And all of them contain provisions for what's called like best management practices or best scientific risk analysis, different terms.
[01:15:56.331 --> 01:16:00.932]  But they basically boil down to the agencies telling people how to farm.
[01:16:01.112 --> 01:16:07.393]  Yeah, turning hordes of control freak carbon footprint eugenicists loose on the people.
[01:16:07.933 --> 01:16:10.033]  What does the war map look like right now?
[01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:11.173]  How bad is it?
[01:16:11.193 --> 01:16:13.734]  I know we're having victories and defeats.
[01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:14.814]  How do we defeat them?
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.383]  Well, right now there's a big opening because USDA is holding listening sessions all around the country.
[01:16:21.803 --> 01:16:24.645]  And I'm not holding my breath that USDA is actually listening.
[01:16:24.685 --> 01:16:26.526]  In fact, I bet they aren't.
[01:16:26.926 --> 01:16:34.430]  But the point is, if we get huge crowds there, and overwhelmingly at meeting after meeting after meeting, people there say, we don't want this.
[01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.090]  Stop it.
[01:16:35.651 --> 01:16:38.472]  That's how we hope to get mainstream press attention.
[01:16:38.812 --> 01:16:41.754]  We start reaching out to the Congress, putting pressure on them.
[01:16:42.284 --> 01:16:45.345]  So even, you know, whether USDA is listening or not is almost irrelevant.
[01:16:45.365 --> 01:16:47.245]  What we need is we need crowds at these meetings.
[01:16:48.006 --> 01:16:51.867]  I was listening to Derry Brownfield this morning and he said he's gone to meetings and talked to people that are at them.
[01:16:52.267 --> 01:17:03.970]  He said you'll have 500 people against this, but five or six people for it, and they're all the local Farm Bureau heads who openly have gotten money from the feds and others, literally like 20 pieces of silver.
[01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:05.690]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:08.491]  Last week we had the listening session here in Texas.
[01:17:09.198 --> 01:17:21.802]  Huge crowd, person after person after person, from every walk of life, including people who have technological backgrounds and understand the technology, standing up and saying, don't do this, it's a bad program, we don't want it.
[01:17:22.422 --> 01:17:34.687]  And then the handful of people who spoke for it were the Texas Berryman Association, whose parent organization has gotten money, support producers, whose parent organization has gotten money, and that was about it.
[01:17:35.507 --> 01:17:35.767]  You know?
[01:17:36.704 --> 01:17:38.265]  Yeah, well, these are big monopoly men.
[01:17:38.305 --> 01:17:41.246]  The dairy folks want a monopoly, so they want to shut down small dairies.
[01:17:41.746 --> 01:17:43.947]  The pork people want to shut down the small operators.
[01:17:44.287 --> 01:17:45.448]  Folks, this is do or die.
[01:17:45.488 --> 01:17:51.091]  These are offshore corporations coming in and turning hardcore control freaks loose on you.
[01:17:51.411 --> 01:17:53.372]  And I've met these DNR people and others.
[01:17:54.152 --> 01:17:58.634]  Almost every one of them are right out of 1940 Russia.
[01:17:58.734 --> 01:18:00.015]  I mean, these are like Stalins.
[01:18:00.435 --> 01:18:00.855]  Stay with us.
[01:18:01.115 --> 01:18:05.116]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food.
[01:18:05.397 --> 01:18:09.498]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food.
[01:18:09.778 --> 01:18:14.060]  During the Great Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:20.482]  And as America continues down its current path, for many, the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[01:18:21.022 --> 01:18:28.391]  With massive layoffs and unemployment at record levels, growing your own food will help you save money that you'd normally spend at the grocery store.
[01:18:28.691 --> 01:18:34.798]  Invest in your family's future by stocking up with your very own supply of seeds available from GetSeeds.net.
[01:18:35.779 --> 01:18:38.100]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:19:04.304 --> 01:19:06.428]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:19:06.929 --> 01:19:13.963]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:19:14.503 --> 01:19:20.685]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:19:21.025 --> 01:19:22.905]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:19:23.065 --> 01:19:25.486]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:19:25.566 --> 01:19:36.509]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:19:37.129 --> 01:19:38.409]  It's not about left or right.
[01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:40.170]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:46.983]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:19:47.584 --> 01:19:55.354]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:55.855 --> 01:19:56.997]  The Obama Deception.
[01:19:57.417 --> 01:19:58.619]  The people strike back.
[01:20:00.626 --> 01:20:04.909]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:10.052]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:20:10.252 --> 01:20:11.592]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:11.752 --> 01:20:15.234]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:20.538]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[01:20:26.881 --> 01:20:29.302]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[01:20:35.544 --> 01:20:36.485]  No animal testing.
[01:20:36.745 --> 01:20:38.045]  I use them and love them.
[01:20:38.065 --> 01:20:39.686]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:20:39.966 --> 01:20:41.027]  And I save big time.

[01:20:52.851 --> 01:20:59.394]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:21:10.059 --> 01:21:21.264]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing worse than paying giant property taxes on your own land and having these government bureaucrats come out with their badges and their guns and bug their eyes out at you.
[01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:25.546]  And I'm not against people with long hair and ponytails, it's just that I've seen it a lot.
[01:21:25.586 --> 01:21:29.488]  They show up, they're real, they're looking at everything you've got, and they want your land.
[01:21:30.488 --> 01:21:35.110]  All over the country we've got the phony environmentalists moving into farms and ranches, they steal and harass.
[01:21:35.511 --> 01:21:38.012]  Or they'll claim you've got pot on your property and come in and shoot you.
[01:21:38.652 --> 01:21:40.533]  There have been a lot of famous cases of that.
[01:21:40.553 --> 01:21:43.555]  And you're saying, well, I'm not like that, I'm a good cop.
[01:21:43.755 --> 01:21:46.076]  Well, whatever, it's on record what's going on.
[01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:49.511]  And it's just like the Sheriff of Nottingham.
[01:21:49.551 --> 01:21:50.991]  It's feudalism, it's serfdom.
[01:21:51.271 --> 01:21:53.492]  Got her for about another 10 minutes, then Kevin Gerdau's coming up.
[01:21:54.052 --> 01:21:55.072]  We really appreciate her.
[01:21:55.092 --> 01:21:57.773]  And I gotta get Judith McGeary on for a full hour.
[01:21:58.874 --> 01:22:05.516]  Because I get so mad about what's happening, I keep interrupting, going, and this is happening, and that's happening, and she could talk for an hour on each point I'm making.
[01:22:05.856 --> 01:22:07.756]  She's such an expert on this and such a great lady.
[01:22:08.697 --> 01:22:11.338]  But give out the website for folks that want to find out more.
[01:22:11.658 --> 01:22:15.579]  Tell them what else is happening, how we fight this, where it's going.
[01:22:17.186 --> 01:22:20.928]  Our website is farmandranchfreedom.org.
[01:22:21.128 --> 01:22:23.809]  That's farmandranchfreedom.org.
[01:22:24.289 --> 01:22:26.170]  And there's a section on take action.
[01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:29.792]  And if you aren't going to read anything else on there, go straight to that section.
[01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:31.532]  You can download flyers.
[01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:34.294]  You can download, you know, frequently asked questions.
[01:22:34.334 --> 01:22:35.554]  You can do all sorts of stuff.
[01:22:36.154 --> 01:22:37.915]  Because the key is getting the word out.
[01:22:38.315 --> 01:22:46.359]  I mean, the problem we've got is when you go to these meetings or you go to a county fair or any place, 90% of the people you talk to are against it.
[01:22:46.977 --> 01:22:53.342]  But also, you go to a lot of places and 50 or 60 or 70 percent of people have never even heard about it.
[01:22:54.082 --> 01:22:57.865]  And certainly when you go into the cities, it's even fewer people who've heard about it.
[01:22:58.286 --> 01:22:59.366]  And that's our problem.
[01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:06.632]  The problem is they can push things through based on, you know, feel-good sound bites, that this is a food safety program, things like that.
[01:23:07.392 --> 01:23:09.094]  And people don't know any better.
[01:23:09.614 --> 01:23:11.896]  And so education and reaching out to people
[01:23:12.378 --> 01:23:14.819]  is where we really need help.
[01:23:30.345 --> 01:23:38.267]  But all the rural areas have got satellite dishes, they're watching TV, they're not down at the coffee shop talking, they're not involved.
[01:23:38.387 --> 01:23:43.588]  They have disconnected, and they're going to lose their communities if they don't get fired up and involved right now.
[01:23:44.788 --> 01:23:48.569]  Absolutely, and I think there's a lot of pessimism in the rural communities.
[01:23:48.669 --> 01:23:59.931]  I think they feel, a lot of the rural communities feel that there's no point, that they no longer have a voice in the government because they're so outnumbered by the cities, and so they've given up a lot of folks.
[01:24:00.273 --> 01:24:08.481]  You know, even if they stay on their farms, even if they're still trying to keep their farm together, in terms of activism, in terms of civic involvement, they've thrown up their hands.
[01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:10.903]  And we've got to get the city folks involved.
[01:24:10.943 --> 01:24:12.424]  This is about a food supply.
[01:24:12.765 --> 01:24:20.392]  How does the land of the free, home of the brave, turn into a bunch of cowards that just roll over on their backs with their belly facing up towards the buzzards?
[01:24:20.892 --> 01:24:21.913]  I mean, I'm challenging
[01:24:22.847 --> 01:24:31.212]  People in the city, in the rural areas, all of you, to educate yourselves on this seminal, key issue, and to get aggressive and kick some New World Order butt!
[01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:33.374]  This is outrageous what they're trying!
[01:24:34.134 --> 01:24:35.515]  You're saying get the cities involved.
[01:24:35.555 --> 01:24:36.156]  How do we do that?
[01:24:37.276 --> 01:24:38.737]  We need letters to the editor.
[01:24:38.757 --> 01:24:41.359]  We need people to hit the local farmers markets.
[01:24:41.419 --> 01:24:42.800]  We need people to hit co-ops.
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:44.881]  We need people to go to health food stores.
[01:24:45.322 --> 01:24:50.545]  I mean, any place you can think of where people are a little bit away, you know, just a little bit paying attention,
[01:24:51.004 --> 01:24:54.346]  To their food, to their health, to these kinds of issues.
[01:24:54.906 --> 01:24:55.787]  That's an opening.
[01:24:56.207 --> 01:24:56.687]  Take it.
[01:24:57.208 --> 01:24:59.289]  Point out to them, okay, you care about food?
[01:24:59.669 --> 01:25:03.271]  Then you better start paying attention because you're not going to have these options anymore.
[01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.992]  You're not going to have the local farmers.
[01:25:05.332 --> 01:25:13.477]  You're not going to have the organics and the GMO-free if we don't do something to stop the corporate takeover of our food supply.
[01:25:14.025 --> 01:25:16.526]  Do five more minutes with us and we're going to have you back in the near future.
[01:25:16.866 --> 01:25:20.047]  We'll give out the website again for folks on the other side, and Kevin Trudeau's joining us.
[01:25:20.607 --> 01:25:34.712]  If you're driving along in your pickup truck in East Texas, or in Fredericksburg, Texas, or in Kansas City, Missouri, out there on your farm, or in Northern California on your vineyard, I'm calling you out, mister, you in the pickup truck right now.
[01:25:35.552 --> 01:25:37.693]  You get up off your butt and defend America.
[01:25:37.933 --> 01:25:39.134]  You defend our heritage now.
[01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:43.600]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:25:50.946 --> 01:25:59.312]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:25:59.592 --> 01:26:03.996]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[01:26:04.436 --> 01:26:09.620]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:12.566]  Well, so does he.
[01:27:12.586 --> 01:27:16.909]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:17.429 --> 01:27:19.751]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:27:20.646 --> 01:27:21.507]  Alex Jones.
[01:27:22.247 --> 01:27:33.553]  It's not enough for the control freaks to come on Bosnia around about snail darters or bats or whatever they're... I mean, they've caught the feds planting species all over the U.S.
[01:27:33.573 --> 01:27:34.433]  that aren't endangered.
[01:27:35.374 --> 01:27:37.795]  I mean, this is a criminal group who wants your property.
[01:27:38.175 --> 01:27:39.236]  Criminals run the government.
[01:27:39.716 --> 01:27:40.596]  Judith McGeary.
[01:27:41.457 --> 01:27:43.418]  She is just a great lady.
[01:27:43.438 --> 01:27:44.338]  We've got her on with us.
[01:27:44.418 --> 01:27:47.359]  Farmandranchfreedom.org.
[01:27:47.399 --> 01:27:48.720]  She's the executive director.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.101]  Very honored to have her.
[01:27:50.121 --> 01:27:51.221]  This is the premier group.
[01:27:51.261 --> 01:27:52.142]  You need to get involved.
[01:27:52.162 --> 01:27:53.342]  You need to financially support them.
[01:27:53.362 --> 01:27:55.163]  You need to get up off your butts!
[01:27:56.294 --> 01:28:01.977]  I mean, our tens of thousands of years of heritage as farmers and ranchers is being destroyed, and this affects everybody.
[01:28:02.257 --> 01:28:06.259]  This is a paramilitary takeover of our society, just like they're doing in Africa.
[01:28:06.619 --> 01:28:07.479]  Like they're doing in Europe.
[01:28:07.939 --> 01:28:09.560]  You can't put up with this crap.
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.521]  Alright, Judith, you've got four minutes.
[01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:13.542]  I'm going to sit back and shut up if I can.
[01:28:14.824 --> 01:28:15.664]  Call to arms.
[01:28:15.925 --> 01:28:16.965]  I'm calling people out.
[01:28:17.365 --> 01:28:28.392]  What does a good old boy who is in East Texas listening right now, or a guy running a vineyard in Northern California, or a chicken farm in Oregon, what do they do right now to fight this?
[01:28:29.632 --> 01:28:31.974]  First step, like I said, is educate your community.
[01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:41.279]  And let me say, by the way, actually I'm going to do a call to action of my own, because I've talked to quite a few folks who I know are also listeners of yours, and I hear things like,
[01:28:41.795 --> 01:28:45.398]  Yeah, it's terrible, and I'm going to go hide someplace and raise my own food.
[01:28:46.078 --> 01:28:47.760]  Folks, that's not the answer.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:48.700]  Because guess what?
[01:28:48.961 --> 01:29:02.792]  By the time they finish rounding up everybody else, they've driven all of the existing farmers out of business, and you can't buy things at the feed store, and you can't get a vet to come out to your property without this, and everything else, you're not going to be able to hide from it.
[01:29:03.292 --> 01:29:10.898]  And I was actually very frustrated at the Austin meeting, because a couple of people dodged coming, because they didn't want to put their name down on record.
[01:29:11.665 --> 01:29:13.006]  And we need to get past that.
[01:29:13.126 --> 01:29:22.850]  We really need people to stand up and be willing to go on record because they're going to come for me, and they're going to come for Alex, and they're going to come for a lot of other people long before they ever come for you.
[01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:26.431]  So, you know, get your name on record and be willing to stand up.
[01:29:26.451 --> 01:29:33.274]  They have special units the feds pay for in rural areas for radicals at Organic Farm and don't want to follow orders.
[01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:34.815]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:29:34.995 --> 01:29:37.556]  We've got to all stand up now or we're all going to hang separate.
[01:29:38.547 --> 01:29:39.288]  Absolutely.
[01:29:39.648 --> 01:29:41.989]  So having done that and gotten it off my chest.
[01:29:42.069 --> 01:29:43.790]  First step is educating your community.
[01:29:44.210 --> 01:29:46.051]  Go to the coffee houses and talk to folks.
[01:29:46.171 --> 01:29:47.912]  Go hang out at the feed store.
[01:29:48.213 --> 01:29:50.114]  Put flyers up at the sales barn.
[01:29:50.514 --> 01:29:53.295]  In the cities, hit the health food stores and the co-ops.
[01:29:53.776 --> 01:29:54.616]  Get the word out.
[01:29:55.077 --> 01:29:58.859]  Then what you do is, like USDA, it's holding these listening sessions.
[01:29:58.999 --> 01:30:00.840]  If there's one near you, go to it.
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.861]  We've got those listed on our website.
[01:30:03.442 --> 01:30:12.609]  If you really can't make it in person, you can still submit comments, written comments, they go on the record, and send a copy to your congressmen, your state legislators, your county commissioners.
[01:30:13.049 --> 01:30:14.431]  You know, it's one set of comments.
[01:30:14.491 --> 01:30:15.371]  It doesn't take you very long.
[01:30:15.391 --> 01:30:23.077]  I believe farmers should put up one to ten watt micro-FMs that go out a few miles and put Genesis programming on or do their own shows.
[01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.979]  We need to get aggressive and create our own media as well.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:27.541]  How about a little local newspaper?
[01:30:27.581 --> 01:30:33.025]  How about farmers make their own little newsletter and take your material and others and get it out each week?
[01:30:34.042 --> 01:30:35.663]  That's a fantastic idea.
[01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.185]  That would be wonderful.
[01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:37.865]  And you know what?
[01:30:38.086 --> 01:30:50.076]  A lot of local newspapers will print stuff that you provide because they're so short staffed that unless they're completely controlled, you know, if it's actually a small local one, a lot of times if you go in with an article, they'll print it.
[01:30:50.817 --> 01:30:54.160]  So, you know, start feeding them that information and I love those ideas.
[01:30:54.673 --> 01:31:02.918]  Yeah, we were doing that with the toll roads, and then the toll road company bought over a hundred Texas newspapers on the corridors to shut that down, showing the power.
[01:31:03.278 --> 01:31:07.040]  So folks, if you take action, decide to kick butt, nothing can stop you.
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:12.343]  Judith McGeary, farmandranchfreedom.org Executive Director.
[01:31:12.643 --> 01:31:14.664]  In the last 45 seconds, other key points.
[01:31:16.385 --> 01:31:18.206]  This is our food supply.
[01:31:19.127 --> 01:31:21.048]  There are no other options.
[01:31:21.408 --> 01:31:23.449]  There's no way around this.
[01:31:24.249 --> 01:31:31.374]  The only way to protect our ability to eat and to have a choice in what we eat is by taking this on.
[01:31:33.436 --> 01:31:33.956]  God bless you.
[01:31:33.976 --> 01:31:42.402]  I want to get you up for a full hour and anybody else you recommend, maybe some of the farmers and people being arrested for selling eggs on street corners or watermelons being arrested.
[01:31:42.742 --> 01:31:43.583]  We've had some of them on.
[01:31:43.603 --> 01:31:44.924]  I mean, this is tyranny, folks.
[01:31:45.164 --> 01:31:47.546]  This is the opposite of freedom and it's being done for control.
[01:31:47.946 --> 01:31:49.707]  Judith McGarry, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:31:50.008 --> 01:31:51.689]  God bless you and the key work you're doing.
[01:31:52.529 --> 01:31:53.210]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:31:53.874 --> 01:31:54.135]  You bet.
[01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.778]  Kevin Trudeau coming up.
[01:31:56.259 --> 01:31:57.822]  He's being persecuted as well.
[01:31:57.862 --> 01:31:58.403]  Stay with us.

[01:33:01.104 --> 01:33:03.645]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:33:04.275 --> 01:33:06.396]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:33:06.897 --> 01:33:13.901]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:33:14.486 --> 01:33:20.669]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:33:21.069 --> 01:33:22.910]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:25.451]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:33:25.531 --> 01:33:36.496]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:38.392]  It's not about left or right.
[01:33:38.772 --> 01:33:40.173]  It's about a one world government.
[01:33:40.633 --> 01:33:46.976]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:56.961]  The Obama Deception.
[01:33:57.381 --> 01:33:58.562]  The people strike back.
[01:34:01.835 --> 01:34:02.715]  Spring is here.
[01:34:02.955 --> 01:34:03.736]  Growing season.
[01:34:03.936 --> 01:34:05.896]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:34:06.116 --> 01:34:07.517]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:34:07.837 --> 01:34:08.497]  Think about it.
[01:34:08.797 --> 01:34:12.658]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:34:12.898 --> 01:34:16.359]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:34:16.579 --> 01:34:19.160]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:31.283]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:34:31.523 --> 01:34:31.963]  I think so.
[01:35:01.245 --> 01:35:06.849]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:18.837 --> 01:35:22.219]  Well, he joins us from Germany, but he hails from the United States.
[01:35:22.819 --> 01:35:24.320]  He's Kevin Trudeau.
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:26.402]  He really doesn't need any introduction.
[01:35:26.862 --> 01:35:28.123]  This is the guy I remember
[01:35:29.329 --> 01:35:37.212]  Many, many years ago, more than a decade ago, national TV spots exposing Ritalin is hurting children, shrinking their brains, attacking their hearts.
[01:35:37.592 --> 01:35:39.313]  Now they have to admit that on the drug insert.
[01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:42.734]  Prozac-type drugs causing psychotic behavior.
[01:35:42.754 --> 01:35:48.917]  I mean, this guy has really done so much good putting out books on all the documented herbal
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:53.381]  You know, things that have been known to help the body for thousands of years.
[01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:58.883]  And he's in a landmark case right now in appeals court where they're trying to say he has no First Amendment.
[01:35:58.903 --> 01:36:00.784]  They're also saying that with the Hillary movie.
[01:36:01.144 --> 01:36:03.425]  That was in the Washington Post saying, oh no, no First Amendment.
[01:36:04.306 --> 01:36:07.207]  This case is deciding whether you can criticize Hillary Clinton.
[01:36:08.067 --> 01:36:10.768]  And we have the Fairness Doctrine they want for the Internet.
[01:36:11.088 --> 01:36:16.230]  We have the Cyber Bullying Act saying if someone says you hurt their feelings, a federal felony.
[01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:17.731]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:36:18.647 --> 01:36:21.570]  And Kevin Trudeau is just giant.
[01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:26.214]  I always said, oh, I like Kevin Trudeau around the office, but thought, oh, he's so busy, I won't try to get him on.
[01:36:26.695 --> 01:36:32.640]  Then found out through Man Cow that Mr. Trudeau was familiar with PrisonPlanet.tv and was aware of what we do.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:36.624]  So maybe we'll get him to talk about that a little bit later, because I'm flattered and interested in how he found out about us.
[01:36:36.664 --> 01:36:39.106]  But joining us from Germany is Kevin Trudeau.
[01:36:39.707 --> 01:36:44.871]  He's an absolute giant when it comes to exposing corruption and funding himself to be able to do that.
[01:36:44.891 --> 01:36:50.756]  You know, doing good moral things and becoming successful, that is the American way, and that's why they're coming after him.
[01:36:50.977 --> 01:36:52.618]  Kevin Trudeau, great to have you here, sir.
[01:36:53.239 --> 01:36:53.979]  It's my pleasure.
[01:36:53.999 --> 01:36:54.940]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:05.169]  You know, you don't like talking about yourself, but people that don't know all the things you've done, break down all the great things you've done, and then now how they're coming against you and all of our free speech.
[01:37:06.087 --> 01:37:09.209]  Well, my books now have sold over 50 million copies.
[01:37:09.269 --> 01:37:12.110]  My biggest book was Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About.
[01:37:12.130 --> 01:37:16.292]  That was number one on the New York Times bestseller list 26 weeks in a row.
[01:37:16.793 --> 01:37:18.994]  It actually was the number one selling book in America.
[01:37:19.094 --> 01:37:20.175]  It beat Harry Potter.
[01:37:20.555 --> 01:37:24.217]  And that's never been done in history, especially if it's a non-fiction book.
[01:37:25.477 --> 01:37:30.360]  But way back when, in 1989, I went on TV, as you mentioned earlier,
[01:37:30.942 --> 01:37:36.585]  With a program called Mega Memory, I founded the American Memory Institute, which became the largest memory training school in the world.
[01:37:37.006 --> 01:37:40.668]  And I was teaching children how to improve their memory so they could do better in school.
[01:37:41.308 --> 01:37:54.576]  And a guy named Sean Shanahan had a reading program called Hooked on Phonics, because he was upset that they were taking, the Department of Education was taking phonics out of the schools, dumbing down our kids.
[01:37:55.216 --> 01:38:00.199]  So he was teaching kids how to read by teaching them phonics, which they should have been taught in the schools.
[01:38:00.803 --> 01:38:19.589]  I was teaching a memory training so they could remember more information and have a higher self-esteem and do better, and I exposed that the Department of Education put a mandate out to school systems saying, the more kids you get on Ritalin, the ADD drug, you're going to be benefited financially.
[01:38:19.649 --> 01:38:23.150]  We'll pay you $500 for every child you get on Ritalin.
[01:38:23.650 --> 01:38:29.132]  So the school system started drugging the kids, basically making them brain dead.
[01:38:30.411 --> 01:38:39.919]  They were taking phonics out of the schools, dumbing them down to their illiterate, and I was exposing this.
[01:38:40.639 --> 01:38:41.460]  Guess what happened?
[01:38:41.941 --> 01:38:54.872]  I got sued by the Federal Trade Commission for false and misleading advertising, even though of the $400 million worth of memory courses that I sold, there were no complaints.
[01:38:57.011 --> 01:39:03.491]  Federal judges, I had politicians bought the program, said it was great, but the FTC was mandated!
[01:39:04.352 --> 01:39:05.793]  To shut me up.
[01:39:05.853 --> 01:39:12.356]  By the way, Kevin, I bought your system when I was in junior high or high school, and I already had a great memory.
[01:39:12.396 --> 01:39:13.617]  Certainly improved what I was doing.
[01:39:13.897 --> 01:39:14.738]  It's a free country.
[01:39:14.878 --> 01:39:17.779]  I'm allowed to buy your product, even if it's crap.
[01:39:17.819 --> 01:39:18.760]  Which, by the way, it's not.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:19.841]  That's why you're so successful.
[01:39:20.301 --> 01:39:21.882]  That's because you do sell a lot of great stuff.
[01:39:22.202 --> 01:39:23.042]  That's my right.
[01:39:23.222 --> 01:39:27.845]  And now they're even going after Cheerios, saying it'll lower your cholesterol.
[01:39:27.865 --> 01:39:29.066]  You know, a diet rich in this.
[01:39:29.406 --> 01:39:30.987]  I mean, this is really a tyranny.
[01:39:31.907 --> 01:39:43.878]  It really is suppression of the free flow of information, because if people bought, let's say, my program MegaMemory, you know, they sued Sean Shanahan, was hooked on Phonics, and bankrupted the guy.
[01:39:44.198 --> 01:39:47.441]  Luckily, I had the funding to fight back.
[01:39:48.342 --> 01:39:52.325]  My companies over the last few years have been around $3 billion in sales.
[01:39:52.365 --> 01:39:55.448]  I've been very lucky to have the financial backing to say no,
[01:39:56.232 --> 01:39:57.613]  You're not going to win.
[01:39:57.953 --> 01:40:03.915]  Now, we'll talk about the fact that I just got fined $37 million, which I'm fighting in the appeals court.
[01:40:03.975 --> 01:40:05.496]  Luckily, that didn't break me.
[01:40:05.616 --> 01:40:09.838]  It's not going to change my lifestyle, but I am, of course, fighting that in the appeals court.
[01:40:10.118 --> 01:40:22.123]  The bottom line is the federal government wants to suppress the free flow of information, and they do it by intimidation and scaring people to keep them quiet.
[01:40:22.659 --> 01:40:26.242]  They don't want people to know the truth about natural cures.
[01:40:26.262 --> 01:40:29.425]  They don't want to know the truth about the dangers of psychotic drugs.
[01:40:29.725 --> 01:40:32.687]  They don't want to know the truth about what's happening with the money supply.
[01:40:32.948 --> 01:40:39.093]  They don't want to know the truth about the fact that the food supply in America is so depleted of nutritional value.
[01:40:39.693 --> 01:40:40.354]  I'll tell people.
[01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:41.795]  I'm in Europe right now.
[01:40:42.756 --> 01:40:44.317]  I know what an apple tastes like.
[01:40:44.597 --> 01:40:46.179]  I know what a cucumber tastes like.
[01:40:46.259 --> 01:40:47.480]  I know what a carrot tastes like.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:48.901]  If you're living in America,
[01:40:49.315 --> 01:40:56.482]  You don't know what those things taste like anymore because the depletion of the soil in the U.S.
[01:40:56.502 --> 01:40:58.163]  is beyond comprehension.
[01:40:58.203 --> 01:41:02.267]  You'd have to eat... Dr. Emanuel Sharaskhan said this 15 years ago.
[01:41:02.667 --> 01:41:06.891]  He said you'd have to eat five times as much food to get the same nutritional value.
[01:41:08.018 --> 01:41:11.199]  Then your grandparents did just 20 or 30 years ago.
[01:41:11.259 --> 01:41:15.361]  You know, Kevin Trudeau, I was just talking to the head of a farm and ranch organization last hour.
[01:41:15.821 --> 01:41:19.282]  The feds are openly saying they're going to shut down most of the family farms and ranches.
[01:41:19.683 --> 01:41:22.044]  And the big agribusiness, they're exempt from all this.
[01:41:22.084 --> 01:41:22.664]  They wrote it.
[01:41:23.604 --> 01:41:27.025]  And you know, how dare you or somebody else put out a book or a video exposing them?
[01:41:27.065 --> 01:41:29.026]  I guess the feds will just sue you now.
[01:41:29.086 --> 01:41:30.287]  We were talking during the break.
[01:41:31.172 --> 01:41:44.383]  Can you specifically tell the listeners what you told me, that in this court case they're saying, and now in other court cases, that there is no First Amendment, and that they're trying to set the precedent to literally fine or arrest people they don't like?
[01:41:45.004 --> 01:41:45.244]  Right.
[01:41:45.264 --> 01:41:58.615]  For 35 years, the Federal Trade Commission had a doctrine called the Mirror Image Doctrine, and what it said is, any person can write a book about anything, and that person can then talk about it and express their opinion.
[01:41:59.318 --> 01:42:05.861]  And if they do that, the Federal Trade Commission won't go after them for false and misleading advertising.
[01:42:06.341 --> 01:42:23.948]  Because of my book, my most recent book was called The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You To Know About, where I exposed a cure for obesity that was discovered in 1959 by Dr. Simeons, a British MD, and it has been suppressed all these years.
[01:42:24.468 --> 01:42:26.629]  And I wrote the book, sold millions of copies,
[01:42:27.091 --> 01:42:32.274]  Hundreds of thousands of Americans did the program, found it to be easy, and virtually a cure for obesity.
[01:42:32.574 --> 01:42:37.697]  You lose the weight and it never comes back, because Simeons found the cause of obesity.
[01:42:38.398 --> 01:42:47.884]  Well, when I wrote this book, I said in the book that the Federal Trade Commission and the FDA is designed to protect the profits of the major corporations.
[01:42:48.364 --> 01:42:54.348]  They're protecting lap band surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and this most horrible drug called L.I.
[01:42:55.615 --> 01:42:59.097]  Which is just, you have to wear diapers if you take it because you crap your pants.
[01:42:59.717 --> 01:43:04.080]  And if you take it, ooh, you'll lose four pounds every six months.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:09.103]  It doesn't even do anything for weight loss, but the companies, the drug companies are making billions.
[01:43:09.703 --> 01:43:22.411]  When I wrote this book, it was so popular that the drug companies forced the FTC to sue me, and the FTC said, we are canceling our mirror image doctrine, we now
[01:43:23.223 --> 01:43:23.463]  I don't
[01:43:44.761 --> 01:43:45.462]  We're wrong.
[01:43:45.882 --> 01:43:47.043]  They didn't like my book.
[01:43:47.443 --> 01:43:48.644]  We'll take Irwin Schiff.
[01:43:49.125 --> 01:43:54.709]  Irwin Schiff wrote a book saying the IRS is a fraud, a collection agency for the private Federal Reserve, which is true.
[01:43:55.450 --> 01:43:56.831]  But regardless, it was a lie.
[01:43:56.851 --> 01:43:57.852]  He still has a right to write it.
[01:43:58.172 --> 01:44:01.435]  The judge told him, don't issue that book anymore, don't print anymore.
[01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:02.335]  He did.
[01:44:02.355 --> 01:44:03.677]  They arrested him, tried him.
[01:44:03.977 --> 01:44:04.918]  He's in prison.
[01:44:05.538 --> 01:44:10.299]  For the book, and you know, they're telling the makers of the Hillary movie they're not allowed to put that out.
[01:44:10.679 --> 01:44:14.420]  They've, as I said earlier, they've introduced bills to restrict free speech.
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:23.281]  I mean, they are really scared of what people are saying and doing right now, or they wouldn't be moving like this against the First Amendment.
[01:44:23.762 --> 01:44:25.662]  I think they've bitten off more than they can chew.
[01:44:25.702 --> 01:44:27.102]  I think this is going to blow up in their face.
[01:44:27.522 --> 01:44:30.023]  You know, the New Freedom Initiative's internal documents came out in 2006.
[01:44:31.423 --> 01:44:46.290]  As I'm sure you know, saying the plan by the FDA and the schools is to get half the kids on Ritalin and Prozac classes of drugs up from 15% and that it is all just a business operation and they were given campaign money to do it.
[01:44:46.690 --> 01:44:49.892]  Now that was released by one of the board members, made the news, not big news.
[01:44:50.772 --> 01:44:52.833]  There is the evidence of criminal activity.
[01:44:53.113 --> 01:44:58.316]  It's okay to push deadly drugs on kids, but you don't dare tell them the Cheerios might be good for them.
[01:44:59.588 --> 01:45:14.679]  Correct, and the point that people listening need to understand is that the federal government, specifically agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration, these agencies are not protecting the United States citizens.
[01:45:15.219 --> 01:45:23.185]  These agencies are protecting the profits of the corporations that donate the most money to the political campaigns.
[01:45:23.845 --> 01:45:26.427]  That's the fact, and here's a perfect example about this.
[01:45:27.462 --> 01:45:34.905]  The FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, routinely sues companies for false and misleading advertising.
[01:45:35.365 --> 01:45:42.188]  If you look at the last five years, they've sued small, independent companies, and they always have the same M.O.
[01:45:42.228 --> 01:45:53.612]  They go into court, they never call the company in advance, they rush into court secretly and demand that the judge freeze all personal and corporate assets of the company.
[01:45:54.301 --> 01:45:57.082]  Which the judge grants 99% of the time.
[01:45:57.282 --> 01:45:59.243]  So now they don't have money to defend themselves?
[01:45:59.583 --> 01:46:00.823]  Bankrupting the company.
[01:46:01.103 --> 01:46:01.423]  Okay?
[01:46:01.524 --> 01:46:02.204]  That's number one.
[01:46:02.984 --> 01:46:07.706]  Now, when they did that to me, I was the first person where the judge didn't freeze the assets.
[01:46:07.766 --> 01:46:10.867]  And even if they did, corporate and personal, they can only freeze US assets.
[01:46:10.887 --> 01:46:20.030]  And because they have companies in 60 countries around the world, we had a defense team lined up from all over the globe to handle the case.
[01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:22.971]  But the FTC and the FDA,
[01:46:23.686 --> 01:46:28.736]  ...has never sued a drug company for false and misleading advertising.
[01:46:29.417 --> 01:46:33.586]  They don't sue them, even though the FDA itself has said repeatedly.
[01:46:33.993 --> 01:46:43.640]  That advertising for drugs is blatantly false and misleading because it makes people believe the drugs are more effective than they are and safer than they are.
[01:46:43.861 --> 01:46:45.082]  Oh, Kevin, hold on.
[01:46:45.402 --> 01:46:45.622]  Stay there.
[01:46:45.642 --> 01:46:46.142]  We got a break.
[01:46:46.463 --> 01:46:49.025]  Yeah, they have drug ads where they don't even say what the drug does.
[01:46:49.045 --> 01:46:50.306]  It just says, ask your doctor.
[01:46:50.646 --> 01:46:52.627]  And then you find out the drug makes you have a heart attack and die.
[01:46:52.667 --> 01:46:54.749]  And the crazy zombies run out and buy it.
[01:46:54.909 --> 01:46:58.132]  But Kevin Trudeau, he's bad saying, take vitamins.
[01:46:58.232 --> 01:46:59.513]  Oh, he's so evil.
[01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:00.774]  Gotta stop him.
[01:47:01.554 --> 01:47:07.016]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:47:07.056 --> 01:47:07.576]  and the world.
[01:47:07.836 --> 01:47:11.297]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:47:11.717 --> 01:47:17.939]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:47:18.199 --> 01:47:20.000]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:28.182]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:47:28.462 --> 01:47:32.886]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:47:33.166 --> 01:47:38.691]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:47:38.971 --> 01:47:40.973]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:47:41.153 --> 01:47:43.395]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:47:43.735 --> 01:47:44.515]  Free of charge.
[01:47:44.815 --> 01:47:45.135]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.

[01:47:46.776 --> 01:47:47.356]  Factory direct.
[01:47:47.376 --> 01:47:48.896]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:47:48.916 --> 01:47:49.576]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:47:49.677 --> 01:47:52.157]  Are you tired of losing your hard earned savings in retirement?
[01:48:04.113 --> 01:48:10.676]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[01:48:11.156 --> 01:48:15.378]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[01:48:15.948 --> 01:48:25.532]  Call me at 800-686-2237 extension 115 and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[01:48:25.932 --> 01:48:35.657]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[01:48:36.017 --> 01:48:39.618]  Call me, Duane Daly, at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.822]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.

[01:48:50.084 --> 01:48:58.849]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[01:49:01.130 --> 01:49:06.373]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:49:07.163 --> 01:49:12.506]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:49:13.027 --> 01:49:19.230]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:49:19.531 --> 01:49:21.352]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:49:21.512 --> 01:49:23.893]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:49:23.973 --> 01:49:34.860]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:49:37.148 --> 01:49:38.409]  It's not about left or right.
[01:49:38.809 --> 01:49:40.210]  It's about a one world government.
[01:49:40.670 --> 01:49:47.034]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:49:47.575 --> 01:49:55.360]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.001]  The Obama Deception.
[01:49:57.421 --> 01:49:58.622]  The people strike back.
[01:50:00.422 --> 01:50:05.309]  Since 1991, The Seven Store has been helping you prepare in the event of an emergency.

[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:51.620]  Or call us today at 888-654-3447.
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:51.920]  That's 888-654-3447.
[01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:10.384]  Okay, Kevin Trudeau for the rest of the hour with us.
[01:51:10.885 --> 01:51:12.407]  Just talking to him again during the break.
[01:51:13.528 --> 01:51:15.110]  I'll ask that question on air.
[01:51:15.371 --> 01:51:17.574]  What are you doing over in Germany right now, Kevin Trudeau?
[01:51:17.914 --> 01:51:19.416]  Well, I've been in Europe for a couple months.
[01:51:19.476 --> 01:51:24.963]  My friend is the Crown Prince in Bahrain and invited me to the Formula One, so I kind of started the trip there.
[01:51:25.704 --> 01:51:27.226]  Of course, Bilderberg is in Greece.
[01:51:27.246 --> 01:51:30.148]  I have friends who are part of that organization.
[01:51:30.168 --> 01:51:39.236]  The Global Climate Change Summit is going on in Copenhagen, so I had to shoot up there to meet some people and find out what the real scoop is behind the scenes that you're not hearing about on the news.
[01:51:40.417 --> 01:51:47.143]  The Formula One was in Monte Carlo, which is always a good fun, of course, and a lot of people come to the film festival in Cannes.
[01:51:47.603 --> 01:51:52.848]  So during this time of year, I like to be in Europe because I can meet a lot of people, get a lot of background information, a lot of
[01:51:53.368 --> 01:51:55.529]  Behind the scenes, inside information.
[01:51:55.549 --> 01:52:07.314]  I'll tell you what, some of the conversations you have on the 200 foot yachts off the coast of Monaco, you can't believe what really goes on behind closed doors.
[01:52:08.166 --> 01:52:10.309]  And this is what you're exposing, Alex.
[01:52:10.570 --> 01:52:12.993]  I'm a big fan of your documentary work.
[01:52:13.354 --> 01:52:15.517]  You know, I watched Endgame years ago when it first came out.
[01:52:15.557 --> 01:52:16.498]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:16.538 --> 01:52:18.922]  If people haven't watched that, they need to watch that.
[01:52:19.703 --> 01:52:23.789]  Both of those documentaries to really understand what's going on.
[01:52:23.829 --> 01:52:24.430]  And the fact is,
[01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:27.654]  People are being misled.
[01:52:27.934 --> 01:52:39.789]  And once you know, once you have your eyes open, now you're empowered and you can do things that you need to do to make your life better and protect your financial future for you and your family.
[01:52:40.242 --> 01:53:00.098]  And the establishment, when they had all the media sewed up, and you're really the pioneer of alternative media, I can't think of anybody who, before the internet age, had gone out there, gotten his alternative ideas out, and been successful in the marketplace of ideas, and they want to cheat with a rigged table here, and not allow your information to come out, and everybody else's.
[01:53:01.258 --> 01:53:12.346]  Yeah, I'll give you a lot of information.
[01:53:13.067 --> 01:53:24.995]  I happen to have a lot of inside connections all around the world, also in Malaysia and China, and many of these people are members of royal families, which is a reason why I know a lot of these people.
[01:53:25.015 --> 01:53:29.518]  I've just been very fortunate over the years to make these connections and have these contacts.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.463]  But when I was on with Matt Lauer, I was on the Today Show, it was live.
[01:53:36.103 --> 01:53:39.986]  And Matt thought he was going to blast me because of my book Natural Cures.
[01:53:40.466 --> 01:53:43.688]  And the first question he said is, you know, you're not a doctor.
[01:53:43.708 --> 01:53:46.089]  What qualifies you to write the book Natural Cures?
[01:53:46.710 --> 01:53:50.112]  And I says, Matt, one of your good friends is Donald Trump.
[01:53:50.632 --> 01:53:52.733]  He just filed bankruptcy three times.
[01:53:52.833 --> 01:53:55.815]  What qualifies him to write a book on how to be a successful businessman?
[01:53:57.412 --> 01:53:59.714]  And it was complete silence, and I didn't know what to say.
[01:53:59.974 --> 01:54:01.956]  The rest of the interview went very, very well.
[01:54:02.556 --> 01:54:04.678]  And I really had good comebacks from that.
[01:54:04.778 --> 01:54:09.221]  Well, right after that interview, I was immediately cancelled on Larry King.
[01:54:10.522 --> 01:54:12.944]  And Larry King called me.
[01:54:12.984 --> 01:54:20.830]  He said, Kevin, I'm really sorry, but they said that you can do Paula Zahn because she can edit you, but they don't want you live anymore.
[01:54:20.850 --> 01:54:22.772]  They're just afraid of what you're going to say.
[01:54:23.447 --> 01:54:26.909]  I've been told the same thing about myself by a lot of producers.
[01:54:26.929 --> 01:54:28.290]  They'll set me up and then it gets cancelled.
[01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:30.652]  And they say, we're only allowed to do tape with you.
[01:54:30.672 --> 01:54:34.174]  I guess because they've got to have a rigged stack deck again.
[01:54:53.387 --> 01:54:54.327]  Just for people there.
[01:54:54.647 --> 01:55:01.049]  But he said, but on television we have a certain agenda we have to promote.
[01:55:01.810 --> 01:55:03.710]  And this is what people don't realize.
[01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:06.671]  I was on Fox with Bill O'Reilly and Judge Napolitano.
[01:55:06.891 --> 01:55:11.472]  They tell you in advance, we promote, we are told we have to take this viewpoint.
[01:55:12.453 --> 01:55:19.295]  And the information people are getting from the mainstream media is so skewed, I would tell everyone.
[01:55:20.603 --> 01:55:24.885]  Stop watching the news on television!
[01:55:25.425 --> 01:55:26.646]  Just shut it off!
[01:55:26.706 --> 01:55:30.328]  You are being brainwashed beyond belief!
[01:55:30.808 --> 01:55:43.895]  Listen to Alex's show, go to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and .tv, get the information from the alternative sources that don't have the filters!
[01:55:44.801 --> 01:55:54.252]  You're getting truthful information here, and with the truthful information, with your eyes open, you can make intelligent decisions and you'll do better in your life.
[01:56:04.703 --> 01:56:13.414]  I did three billion dollars just from infomercials in America, selling my mostly books on television, and I've been the only guy to be able to sell books on TV.
[01:56:13.714 --> 01:56:16.617]  Fifty million copies of my books have been sold.
[01:56:16.637 --> 01:56:20.322]  My most recent book is called Recession Cures, which is coming out soon.
[01:56:20.342 --> 01:56:21.143]  We're about to break.
[01:56:21.203 --> 01:56:24.206]  I want to talk about that, because you wrote books, many, many...
[01:56:25.847 --> 01:56:32.310]  A decade ago about the scams with credit cards, the scams with the predatory lending, where all this was going.
[01:56:32.670 --> 01:56:34.410]  Some of the websites were naturalcures.com.
[01:56:34.450 --> 01:56:37.171]  We'll give you all the contact info for Kevin Trudeau.
[01:56:37.211 --> 01:56:40.452]  Long segment coming up and then I'm going to pump you for Bilderberg info.
[01:56:40.892 --> 01:56:44.054]  Just an amazing interview here live right now with Kevin Trudeau.
[01:56:44.514 --> 01:56:45.314]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:56:51.176 --> 01:56:52.076]  We're on the march.
[01:56:52.576 --> 01:56:54.077]  The empire's on the run.
[01:56:55.087 --> 01:56:57.779]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:09.379]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:57:09.639 --> 01:57:14.063]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[01:57:14.503 --> 01:57:19.747]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:57:34.058 --> 01:57:35.219]  Folks, you've got to try this.
[01:57:35.559 --> 01:57:41.724]  These foods promote nutritional excellence, health and well-being, beauty enhancement, and truly sustainable agriculture.
[01:57:42.064 --> 01:57:45.927]  Many foods today have herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, and insecticides.
[01:57:46.187 --> 01:57:51.571]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:58:14.773 --> 01:58:20.977]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:58:21.357 --> 01:58:23.198]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:58:23.338 --> 01:58:25.760]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:36.767]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:58:37.407 --> 01:58:38.688]  It's not about left or right.
[01:58:39.088 --> 01:58:40.449]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:58:40.931 --> 01:58:47.258]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:58:56.108 --> 01:58:57.270]  The Obama Deception.
[01:58:57.690 --> 01:58:58.872]  The people strike back.
[01:59:00.603 --> 01:59:02.124]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:59:02.304 --> 01:59:03.766]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:59:04.046 --> 01:59:06.268]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:59:06.728 --> 01:59:11.472]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:59:11.872 --> 01:59:14.715]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:59:15.055 --> 01:59:18.538]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:59:18.965 --> 01:59:30.951]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:59:31.511 --> 01:59:33.492]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:59:33.512 --> 01:59:34.813]  I use one every day.
[01:59:35.233 --> 01:59:37.574]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:59:37.654 --> 01:59:39.315]  Well, Kevin Trudeau needs no introduction.
[02:00:09.312 --> 02:00:12.999]  And I've seen a lot of his books, read several of them.
[02:00:14.462 --> 02:00:18.469]  You know, got his mega memory thing decades ago and just found it all to be really great info.
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:23.701]  But even if it was all a bunch of baloney, he has a right to sell it, to write it, to say it.
[02:00:24.421 --> 02:00:29.143]  But it is because he's exposing Ritalin first, and exposing the credit card companies first.
[02:00:29.203 --> 02:00:30.483]  I mean, first in a big way.
[02:00:30.743 --> 02:00:31.963]  He's the guy everybody imitates.
[02:00:32.384 --> 02:00:36.225]  That's why they're going after the Big Daddy, the Big Kahuna.
[02:00:36.605 --> 02:00:40.906]  And that's why, even if you don't like Kevin Trudeau, most people I know love him, you need to support him.
[02:00:41.406 --> 02:00:44.827]  Because we all hang together, as the Founding Fathers said, or we hang separate.
[02:00:44.847 --> 02:00:47.428]  Now, I'm intrigued by Bilderberg, Michael Trudeau, because
[02:00:48.408 --> 02:00:49.129]  Daniel Estelin.
[02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:51.912]  He has several people he knows in Bilderberg.
[02:00:52.252 --> 02:00:54.054]  People he calls attendees, not members.
[02:00:54.535 --> 02:00:59.420]  And I know he's not making it up, because I have some other inside sources, and I believe Daniel.
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:00:59.920]  Danny.
[02:01:01.601 --> 02:01:04.742]  But he talks about how a lot of them don't like what's going on.
[02:01:04.802 --> 02:01:09.604]  It's about 25 people at the very top of that that are steering it, but they're networking as elitist.
[02:01:10.185 --> 02:01:18.728]  And so you're saying you know some Bilderberger people, but then you mention, I mean, George Soros, quite a stinker there, who's bragged he's having, quote, a great crisis.
[02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:28.633]  So, so, I mean, the New World Order, this global system, from your research, you know, as a multi-multi-billionaire, internationally known, who does jet-set around talking to all these people,
[02:01:29.733 --> 02:01:30.874]  You know, who is the New World Order?
[02:01:30.914 --> 02:01:31.675]  Where are they going?
[02:01:31.995 --> 02:01:33.076]  What's their main goal?
[02:01:33.396 --> 02:01:34.997]  And any inside info from Bilderberg 2009?
[02:01:36.258 --> 02:01:42.023]  Well, yeah, the specific goal is when you sit down with these people, and I've traveled the world with these guys.
[02:01:42.623 --> 02:01:47.267]  You know, they really, I would say they're not, you know, they're not Dr. Evil.
[02:01:47.767 --> 02:01:51.350]  They're not sitting there planning on wiping out the population.
[02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:53.952]  In a weird way, they think what they're doing is
[02:01:54.827 --> 02:02:01.612]  It's for the best for everyone, but they do categorically believe there's two classes of people on planet Earth.
[02:02:02.213 --> 02:02:20.147]  There's the ruling elite class, and they do believe, and you know, Henry Ford talked about this, Andrew Carnegie at the turn of the century talked about this, and throughout history, they do believe that through genes and DNA, even Donald Trump has said it over and over again, you have to have good genes, otherwise you're not going to make any money.
[02:02:20.993 --> 02:02:22.275]  They believe it's genetic.
[02:02:22.815 --> 02:02:25.098]  And so they believe there's two classes of people.
[02:02:25.158 --> 02:02:34.790]  That there's a ruling class by genetics that are powerful enough and genetically designed to rule the other people that are nothing more than the worker bees.
[02:02:35.210 --> 02:02:36.391]  That's really what they believe.
[02:02:37.312 --> 02:02:39.713]  I'm telling you, that's where they're at.
[02:02:39.933 --> 02:02:48.595]  But now, because they have robotics, as Bill Joy, head of Sun Microsystems, said in the April 2000 issue of Wired, the future doesn't need us, the elite want to get rid of us.
[02:02:48.635 --> 02:02:58.958]  Now, I know with you, they're not going to come out and say, hey, we want to wipe everybody out, but I have ABC News here, and Times of London, Billionaire Club, and Bid to Curb, overpopulation.
[02:02:59.098 --> 02:02:59.938]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:03:00.719 --> 02:03:01.459]  Absolutely.
[02:03:01.499 --> 02:03:05.980]  And I've been sitting on the boats off the coast of Barbados.
[02:03:06.784 --> 02:03:14.769]  With the guys who basically said we need to get two-thirds of the dumb people off the planet.
[02:03:15.327 --> 02:03:19.191]  I mean, I've been in the meetings, and it wasn't in an evil way.
[02:03:19.511 --> 02:03:26.778]  It's a matter-of-fact kind of way that they think it's for the benefit of planet Earth and themselves.
[02:03:27.078 --> 02:03:27.939]  Oh yeah, they're committed.
[02:03:28.159 --> 02:03:32.363]  I mean, they've said this is bad genetics, they're passing it on, they're lazy.
[02:03:33.644 --> 02:03:39.549]  Here's my next question, and after you finish what you're about to say, it's just so intriguing, this conversation we're having is blowing me away.
[02:03:40.570 --> 02:03:44.572]  And I always have done this, you know, as a quote journalist, they say this is off record.
[02:03:44.592 --> 02:03:47.394]  People know I don't ever break off the record meetings.
[02:03:47.834 --> 02:03:52.476]  I've met with major CEOs, biggest Hollywood people there are, you know, just huge.
[02:03:53.437 --> 02:03:57.579]  And they go, Alex, you try to warn them and look, some listen, most don't.
[02:03:57.619 --> 02:03:58.519]  They want to be slaves.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:03:59.340]  They want to die.
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:00.561]  You know, join us.
[02:04:00.641 --> 02:04:01.301]  You're smart.
[02:04:01.381 --> 02:04:01.701]  You're good.
[02:04:01.721 --> 02:04:02.742]  You know, that's the sales.
[02:04:03.382 --> 02:04:03.662]  Well,
[02:04:31.778 --> 02:04:40.863]  They're not concerned, quite frankly, so much with spreading the word because, as you just said, their belief is no one's going to listen anyway.
[02:04:41.883 --> 02:04:42.664]  So who cares?
[02:04:42.744 --> 02:04:46.526]  It's like, you know, you're more of an annoyance than anything.
[02:04:47.245 --> 02:04:57.091]  But actually, they believe that what you're doing and what I'm doing is in a way to their benefit, because we're desensitizing people to these realities.
[02:04:57.651 --> 02:04:58.031]  Yes.
[02:04:58.491 --> 02:04:59.492]  Absolutely.
[02:04:59.572 --> 02:05:00.252]  I've been told!
[02:05:00.312 --> 02:05:02.814]  That's why I still get invited on the apps!
[02:05:03.654 --> 02:05:04.675]  I've been told that too.
[02:05:04.936 --> 02:05:05.816]  And, you know, wow.
[02:05:06.637 --> 02:05:07.498]  Unbelievable.
[02:05:07.658 --> 02:05:11.822]  But in terms of economics, I mentioned to you off the break that I was talking to George Soros.
[02:05:12.182 --> 02:05:18.768]  He said, you know, we're making, and I know a lot of this inside information as well, we're making more money now because of the crisis.
[02:05:19.582 --> 02:05:27.385]  Then you would imagine, I mean, we had stocks shorted huge in the fall before they all crashed 90%.
[02:05:27.746 --> 02:05:32.147]  I mean, the fortune we made just shorting the bank stocks was off the charts.
[02:05:32.227 --> 02:05:34.829]  I mean, that was the simplest, goofiest thing in the world.
[02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:42.612]  When I wrote my book, Debt Cures, almost three years ago, I was the first guy on national TV to say, look, everyone's a moron.
[02:05:43.808 --> 02:05:47.809]  This consumer lending is going to explode.
[02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:49.629]  The housing market is going to crash.
[02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:51.210]  Foreclosures are going to go through the roof.
[02:05:51.610 --> 02:05:57.391]  And what, at Bilderberg, we talked about is the fact that the media is so stupid.
[02:05:57.411 --> 02:06:01.332]  You don't even have to do anything to the guys on CNBC or MSNBC.
[02:06:01.612 --> 02:06:02.652]  They're so stupid.
[02:06:02.672 --> 02:06:12.874]  75% of Americans in the next two to five years are going to lose their job, get a reduction in pay, or go from full-time to part-time.
[02:06:14.797 --> 02:06:19.761]  It's a designed changing our standard of living for the New World Order.
[02:06:19.961 --> 02:06:21.122]  Kevin, did I hear you correctly?
[02:06:21.162 --> 02:06:22.883]  Were you at Bilderberg?
[02:06:23.563 --> 02:06:24.444]  Yeah, I was in Greece.
[02:06:25.795 --> 02:06:26.976]  Because I have friends who are there.
[02:06:27.557 --> 02:06:29.318]  Right now, by the way, you're not going to believe where I'm at.
[02:06:29.618 --> 02:06:35.163]  I'm in Rotteich-Egen, Germany, which is where Bilderberg had their meeting a few years ago at the same hotel.
[02:06:35.403 --> 02:06:37.264]  The C-Hotel Uberfart.
[02:06:37.865 --> 02:06:44.530]  So you're hanging out with the Crown Prince, and you're telling me you were in a capillary sub-meeting at Bilderberg?
[02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:45.431]  Because I know they have those.
[02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:48.373]  Or, well, I know you're not supposed to say.
[02:06:48.593 --> 02:06:50.295]  You're just letting me know you were in the area.
[02:06:50.715 --> 02:07:00.020]  All I can say, I was in the area and many of the people that were there and our members are, in fact, people that I converse with on a regular basis.
[02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:04.523]  Now I noticed that big palace with three hotels they shut down was right off the bay with all the yachts.
[02:07:04.903 --> 02:07:06.384]  So I guess you were back and forth.
[02:07:06.644 --> 02:07:07.425]  The yachts are great.
[02:07:08.665 --> 02:07:10.046]  What about the yachts?
[02:07:10.066 --> 02:07:12.507]  What's on them is even better, huh?
[02:07:12.547 --> 02:07:16.670]  But here's the funny thing in people listening.
[02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:26.220]  All people, if you know the inside scoop of things, making money is the easiest thing in the world to do.
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:31.125]  That's why guys like... I mean, the economic downturn doesn't affect people at the highest levels.
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:32.280]  Exactly.
[02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:33.501]  Let me tell you a short story.
[02:07:33.541 --> 02:07:34.442]  This is an incredible interview.
[02:07:34.862 --> 02:07:44.789]  I met my in-laws yesterday for Memorial Day, you know, eating lunch, and I explained to them about gold and silver trading and about the business.
[02:07:44.829 --> 02:07:48.932]  And I said, all you do is basically the opposite of what the mainstream media says to do.
[02:07:48.972 --> 02:07:49.653]  And I was telling them,
[02:07:50.473 --> 02:07:53.195]  Six years ago at that table, I said, buy gold and silver.
[02:07:53.215 --> 02:07:54.756]  Silver's at $5, gold's at $300.
[02:07:55.296 --> 02:07:58.037]  It's going to go up in the next five, six years to close to $1,000 or higher.
[02:07:58.598 --> 02:08:02.340]  And they go, no, we remember you telling us that, but still they won't listen.
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:07.443]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating is that that's why it's such a joke to the elite.
[02:08:07.703 --> 02:08:10.565]  You can even tell the public the media is lying to them.
[02:08:10.605 --> 02:08:11.925]  They don't want to believe it.
[02:08:12.105 --> 02:08:12.926]  No, they don't want to believe it.
[02:08:13.446 --> 02:08:22.671]  It's really comical, but let me give you, you asked earlier about the groups, both Gilderberg, Council on Foreign Relations, and a bunch of other groups.
[02:08:23.071 --> 02:08:24.652]  In these circles,
[02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:28.252]  I would suggest to you that there are two factions.
[02:08:28.713 --> 02:08:30.454]  A small faction and a big faction.
[02:08:30.854 --> 02:08:37.339]  The big faction categorically believes that they are genetically superior than the rest of the population.
[02:08:37.839 --> 02:08:46.366]  But there is a small faction, and this faction are the ones that are feeding me information, probably Daniel Estelin information, and so forth.
[02:08:46.686 --> 02:08:51.750]  This small faction are people that really have come to the conclusion that no, no,
[02:08:52.529 --> 02:08:54.209]  Yeah, some people are smarter than others.
[02:08:54.669 --> 02:08:56.410]  Some people are more talented than others.
[02:08:56.690 --> 02:09:00.691]  Some people are more, you know, motivated to work harder than others.
[02:09:00.731 --> 02:09:01.531]  Some people are lazy.
[02:09:01.551 --> 02:09:02.151]  Some people aren't.
[02:09:02.471 --> 02:09:10.093]  But everyone should be allowed to succeed or fail based on their own choices and initiative.
[02:09:10.693 --> 02:09:12.393]  There shouldn't be two classes.
[02:09:12.433 --> 02:09:16.194]  There always will be, but everybody should have the same opportunity.
[02:09:17.094 --> 02:09:21.438]  And that's where there's a split and a division right now at the highest levels.
[02:09:21.738 --> 02:09:38.673]  Now I've been told that it's mainly the younger crowd and by that kind of like the Google CEOs and people who are elitist but they say come on we don't have to wipe everybody out and and and let's give people a chance and then there's kind of the old Rockefeller faction that is I'm 94 launch the operation immediately.
[02:09:39.053 --> 02:09:41.614]  Yeah, and I'll tell you the reason why you're 100% correct there.
[02:09:42.055 --> 02:09:47.177]  If you look at the older crowd, they married only within themselves, in that crowd.
[02:09:47.237 --> 02:09:49.158]  If you remember, you watched the movie Titanic.
[02:09:49.578 --> 02:09:56.862]  You know, you had the first class cabin, and the people who were on the first class deck never mingled, ever.
[02:09:56.982 --> 02:10:00.144]  You didn't even shake hands with somebody who wasn't first class.
[02:10:01.098 --> 02:10:09.807]  And so throughout history, you married and you socialized only with people who were of the same, quote, genetic or DNA structure.
[02:10:10.848 --> 02:10:18.296]  Now, there is a lot more mingling of classes, and therefore you get the Google guys or Michael Bells, people that aren't
[02:10:19.065 --> 02:10:23.708]  That were born on the opposite side of the tracks, but are making some serious money.
[02:10:24.188 --> 02:10:27.090]  And they're not, quote, the right DNA.
[02:10:27.130 --> 02:10:31.833]  They're not the right genetics to the older crowd, like the Rockefellers and so forth.
[02:10:32.273 --> 02:10:34.795]  And so that's where you have the division, and that's where you have the split.
[02:10:34.815 --> 02:10:40.318]  It's a very interesting time, because some of these conversations, and I've been in these conversations,
[02:10:40.818 --> 02:10:44.942]  A really thought-provoking and intriguing conversation.
[02:10:46.023 --> 02:10:53.129]  I believe that, look, if you have a thousand people, give everybody the same chance, everybody the same information, because guess what?
[02:10:53.509 --> 02:10:57.572]  The smart ones who really want to work hard will succeed more than the other people.
[02:10:57.853 --> 02:10:59.374]  But everybody should have the same opportunity.
[02:11:00.057 --> 02:11:02.658]  Well, again, we're talking to Kevin Trudeau.
[02:11:02.718 --> 02:11:04.318]  This is an amazing interview here.
[02:11:05.438 --> 02:11:08.059]  Very, very excited to have you on the show.
[02:11:09.139 --> 02:11:17.841]  Dealing with Bilderberg, any other information that came out, anything else you can tell us that you weren't told to be secretive about?
[02:11:17.881 --> 02:11:21.802]  I think what people really need to understand is, in America,
[02:11:22.719 --> 02:11:25.280]  For the next two to five years, here's what's going to happen.
[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:32.082]  Number one, there's going to be an increased number of people losing their jobs, going from full to part-time, or getting a reduction in pay.
[02:11:32.542 --> 02:11:36.564]  So, 75% of the people in the next two to five years are going to have less money coming in.
[02:11:37.044 --> 02:11:39.805]  Taxes and fees are going to go up.
[02:11:40.205 --> 02:11:41.726]  So, more money is going out.
[02:11:42.146 --> 02:11:42.446]  Okay?
[02:11:43.446 --> 02:11:47.007]  There is going to be a level of inflation.
[02:11:47.047 --> 02:11:51.549]  That's still going to be controlled by the Fed, but there is going to be some type of inflation.
[02:11:52.210 --> 02:11:55.952]  It's undecided whether they want the inflation to be so rampant where the U.S.
[02:11:55.992 --> 02:12:03.695]  dollar no longer becomes the monetary supply of the world, the reserve currency.
[02:12:04.035 --> 02:12:10.378]  That's still being debated because, quite frankly, China wants their dollar to be the reserve currency.
[02:12:10.418 --> 02:12:14.320]  And keep in mind, Bilderberg is only North America and Europe.
[02:12:15.477 --> 02:12:19.040]  And there's another group in a different faction in Southeast Asia.
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:19.920]  I've been down there.
[02:12:20.761 --> 02:12:21.722]  They're at odds.
[02:12:21.742 --> 02:12:24.003]  Who are the Arabs mainly allied with?
[02:12:24.103 --> 02:12:24.924]  Europe and the U.S.?
[02:12:25.304 --> 02:12:27.005]  The Arabs are allied with themselves.
[02:12:27.566 --> 02:12:27.806]  Yeah.
[02:12:28.226 --> 02:12:31.108]  They're 100%, and I just was there in Bahrain.
[02:12:32.809 --> 02:12:34.550]  Basically, they're themselves.
[02:12:34.751 --> 02:12:35.391]  It's oil.
[02:12:35.431 --> 02:12:39.154]  They know they've got about 50 years left, so they're diversifying into banking.
[02:12:39.814 --> 02:12:42.616]  You know, you've said it on the show so many times.
[02:12:43.257 --> 02:12:47.918]  The first number one way to control the planet, or control everything, is control the money.
[02:12:48.499 --> 02:12:49.719]  And that's control the banks.
[02:12:50.159 --> 02:12:51.480]  So that's always number one.
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:58.702]  The other factor, there's another factor that was discussed at the meeting in Greece, and that is something that no one's talking about.
[02:12:59.142 --> 02:13:04.183]  And me and a buddy of mine knew about this four years ago, and we've been really heavily invested in this.
[02:13:05.384 --> 02:13:05.764]  Water.
[02:13:06.744 --> 02:13:07.104]  Oh yeah.
[02:13:07.124 --> 02:13:13.926]  I mean, you notice European and other companies will pay 10-15 times what reservoirs and aquifers are worth.
[02:13:14.186 --> 02:13:15.887]  They are grabbing it all up, aren't they?
[02:13:16.187 --> 02:13:16.427]  Yes.
[02:13:16.867 --> 02:13:18.808]  Water is the next oil.
[02:13:18.828 --> 02:13:27.171]  Because if you control the water supply and the water flows, you have even more control than you do with oil.
[02:13:27.471 --> 02:13:28.251]  Well, here's an example.
[02:13:28.291 --> 02:13:30.512]  Boone Pickens doesn't want to put
[02:13:32.381 --> 02:13:46.070]  Systems, the windmills up in the panhandle of Texas to actually create energy because the lines have to be run so far that you lose the power to the lines.
[02:13:46.410 --> 02:13:48.891]  So if you do the equations, it's not going to make money.
[02:13:49.011 --> 02:13:49.632]  It's not going to
[02:13:49.952 --> 02:13:50.553]  Correct.
[02:13:50.593 --> 02:13:53.436]  And it's very interesting, the last James Bond movie,
[02:14:09.577 --> 02:14:19.481]  Was all about this great, wonderful, quote, environmentalist, who in fact was the evil villain trying to control the water.
[02:14:19.521 --> 02:14:21.361]  I think it was Bolivia or something in the movie.
[02:14:21.942 --> 02:14:36.347]  But believe me, when you watch movies, Hollywood is used categorically, and this has been documented throughout history, as the way to begin to desensitize people to different concepts.
[02:14:37.297 --> 02:14:47.124]  I mean, did you remember back in the old days, a guy would be in a firing squad, and they would say, and this is a black and white movie, they would say, do you have any last requests?
[02:14:47.705 --> 02:14:48.946]  Yeah, I want a cigarette.
[02:14:50.147 --> 02:14:53.149]  Wait a minute, a cigarette is your last request?
[02:14:54.045 --> 02:14:56.667]  That was programming product placement for a cigarette.
[02:14:56.848 --> 02:14:57.668]  Of course!
[02:14:57.768 --> 02:15:01.031]  I mean, okay, Alex, what's your last request?
[02:15:01.392 --> 02:15:03.714]  It's probably not going to be a cigarette.
[02:15:03.734 --> 02:15:06.697]  Well, what do you want after sex in all the movies they want a cigarette?
[02:15:06.877 --> 02:15:11.161]  I mean, that's like Edward Bernays was paid to say bacon had to go with eggs in the morning.
[02:15:11.421 --> 02:15:12.422]  Nobody ate bacon.
[02:15:12.682 --> 02:15:15.305]  It was kind of like a junk thing used for cooking in stews.
[02:15:15.665 --> 02:15:16.165]  Exactly!
[02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:18.410]  And cognac!
[02:15:18.791 --> 02:15:22.152]  Cognac is from the grape skins that they threw away!
[02:15:22.832 --> 02:15:23.292]  Exactly.
[02:15:23.352 --> 02:15:25.093]  So they create markets.
[02:15:25.133 --> 02:15:26.113]  They create markets.
[02:15:26.893 --> 02:15:30.294]  You know, Kevin Trudeau, so you're hanging out with Bilderberg.
[02:15:32.035 --> 02:15:33.755]  So who's coming after you here in the States?
[02:15:34.076 --> 02:15:38.337]  The bigger special interests, the drug companies that don't want you exposing them?
[02:15:38.817 --> 02:15:44.522]  Yeah, well, when I wrote the book, Natural Cures, they don't want you to know about it, I was the first guy to say something, which is heresy.
[02:15:44.962 --> 02:15:48.445]  I said, drug companies don't want to cure disease.
[02:15:49.065 --> 02:15:50.927]  All they want to do is sell drugs.
[02:15:51.467 --> 02:16:01.615]  Drug companies are publicly traded corporations who, the offices and directors have a legal responsibility, a fiduciary legal responsibility to increase shareholder value.
[02:16:02.155 --> 02:16:06.899]  If a drug company's goal was to eliminate all disease, they'd all be bankrupt.
[02:16:07.935 --> 02:16:09.036]  And I pointed that out.
[02:16:09.556 --> 02:16:12.178]  And I pointed that out that they're publicly traded companies.
[02:16:12.218 --> 02:16:16.440]  They have to increase drug usage per person.
[02:16:16.861 --> 02:16:19.302]  They want more people taking more drugs on a regular basis.
[02:16:19.622 --> 02:16:21.904]  They do not want to cure disease.
[02:16:22.484 --> 02:16:25.106]  And when I said that, I was attacked by everybody.
[02:16:25.806 --> 02:16:33.551]  And the attacks actually helped make the book, you know, right now that particular book has sold over 25 million copies in hardcover.
[02:16:34.161 --> 02:16:35.763]  Yeah, so the attacks are actually helping you.
[02:16:35.783 --> 02:16:39.947]  And you know, I called you Michael Trudeau earlier because we used to have a sales manager at the network named Michael Trudeau.
[02:16:40.307 --> 02:16:40.828]  Oh, really?
[02:16:41.348 --> 02:16:42.710]  Yeah, who was a huge fan of you.
[02:16:42.930 --> 02:16:45.092]  Again, we got Kevin Trudeau on the line with us.
[02:16:45.132 --> 02:16:45.853]  Just amazing.
[02:16:47.810 --> 02:16:48.910]  Plug some of the websites.
[02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:50.931]  Where do people get these books?
[02:16:51.071 --> 02:16:52.571]  Is there a central clearinghouse?
[02:16:53.892 --> 02:16:57.593]  I have an online store at naturalcures.com.
[02:16:58.053 --> 02:17:00.114]  And naturalcures.com is a website.
[02:17:00.134 --> 02:17:11.497]  I actually sold it for several hundred million dollars a couple years ago and I took it back because I really want to take that website and make it the ultimate source of natural health information in the world.
[02:17:11.517 --> 02:17:13.898]  It's already one of the most visited natural health sites in the world.
[02:17:14.278 --> 02:17:20.563]  But NaturalCures.com, people can go to, they can get my books at discounts, they can also become a member of that website.
[02:17:21.063 --> 02:17:39.598]  We also have GlobalInformationNetwork.com, which is a new site that basically is going to be launching in the fall, and it's going to be giving information to people who are members from my associates from all the, quote, secret societies.
[02:17:41.948 --> 02:17:49.392]  Oh, so you're gonna start leaking all the info and they don't care because they think we're all mindless slaves anyways and it's part of the conditioning process.
[02:17:49.632 --> 02:17:50.073]  Correct.
[02:17:50.853 --> 02:17:54.295]  Now when we come back, is there anything they're scared of?
[02:17:54.835 --> 02:17:55.295]  I'll tell you.
[02:17:55.315 --> 02:17:55.375]  Yes.
[02:17:56.276 --> 02:17:58.297]  Kevin Trudeau is our guest.
[02:17:58.977 --> 02:18:00.138]  NaturalCures.com
[02:18:01.883 --> 02:18:12.186]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[02:18:13.067 --> 02:18:18.568]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[02:18:19.048 --> 02:18:20.369]  Starve or surrender.
[02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:22.990]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[02:18:27.864 --> 02:18:28.546]  What then?
[02:18:30.250 --> 02:18:33.056]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[02:18:33.337 --> 02:18:37.446]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[02:18:39.398 --> 02:18:40.499]  Big John Lipscomb.
[02:18:40.599 --> 02:18:47.645]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[02:18:47.845 --> 02:18:49.627]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[02:18:49.727 --> 02:18:55.152]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[02:18:55.332 --> 02:18:57.153]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[02:19:00.336 --> 02:19:01.678]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:19:01.838 --> 02:19:06.825]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[02:19:07.225 --> 02:19:09.308]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[02:19:09.648 --> 02:19:18.580]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:25.886]  This program has already settled over 100 million dollars of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.
[02:19:26.206 --> 02:19:32.351]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments, the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[02:19:32.511 --> 02:19:35.293]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[02:19:36.454 --> 02:19:38.996]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.
[02:19:39.256 --> 02:19:44.620]  The call is free and in 10 minutes they will show you how much you can save right over the phone with one simple call.
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:46.962]  Let the bailout group bail you out of debt.
[02:19:47.202 --> 02:19:47.623]  We're good.
[02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:03.673]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:20:03.833 --> 02:20:07.917]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:20:08.097 --> 02:20:19.547]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:20:19.767 --> 02:20:25.572]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:20:25.832 --> 02:20:26.452]  We're good to go!
[02:20:48.641 --> 02:20:49.022]  Let's go!
[02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:13.137]  Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Trudeau, joining us from Germany, has agreed to do 20 more minutes with us into the next hour.
[02:21:13.177 --> 02:21:15.720]  He said he'd do even more, but I don't want to twist his arm.
[02:21:16.341 --> 02:21:19.045]  And just to find out, he really does know the show, he really does listen.
[02:21:21.587 --> 02:21:25.310]  Kevin Trudeau, how often do you listen to this radio show, and how long?
[02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:32.476]  Well, I listen to it, you know, I travel all over the world, with different time zones, but it's pretty easy for me.
[02:21:32.516 --> 02:21:35.698]  I just go online and click InfoWars.com.
[02:21:35.738 --> 02:21:41.903]  I'm also a member of PresidentPlanet.tv, so I can see your good-looking mug there with your HD, you know?
[02:21:44.281 --> 02:21:45.762]  You are something else.
[02:21:46.382 --> 02:21:55.527]  Now, I haven't read all your books, but I remember a listener sent me a mailing you did about one of your books about how you got recruited into the Brotherhood, didn't know it was a sellout at first, but got out of it.
[02:21:55.747 --> 02:22:00.610]  So you're somebody that was in the group, out of the group, and people don't believe this, but I mean, you're a guy that makes billions a year.
[02:22:00.850 --> 02:22:01.290]  They better.
[02:22:02.011 --> 02:22:07.634]  I have been approached by these groups, too, and then people just can't believe it because they're living in la-la land.
[02:22:07.894 --> 02:22:09.415]  We're living in the real world, Kevin.
[02:22:09.895 --> 02:22:13.417]  Yeah, it's hard for the average person to grasp
[02:22:15.109 --> 02:22:18.576]  Here's what I think is hard to everyone listening.
[02:22:19.217 --> 02:22:21.742]  It's hard for you to grasp this.
[02:22:23.124 --> 02:22:27.232]  The number one motivator of the average person is money.
[02:22:28.570 --> 02:22:29.731]  Now, some people say it's sex.
[02:22:29.911 --> 02:22:30.411]  That's true.
[02:22:30.751 --> 02:22:31.992]  But it's generally money.
[02:22:32.593 --> 02:22:34.134]  So money is the number one motivator.
[02:22:34.154 --> 02:22:39.677]  If you look in prisons today, 90% of the people in jail are there because of a money-related crime.
[02:22:40.017 --> 02:22:41.118]  They were trying to sell drugs.
[02:22:41.158 --> 02:22:41.978]  They robbed a bank.
[02:22:42.319 --> 02:22:43.179]  They mugged somebody.
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:45.020]  You know, bank fraud, wire fraud.
[02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:47.762]  It's all about wanting money illegally.
[02:22:47.822 --> 02:22:48.663]  That's why people are in jail.
[02:22:48.683 --> 02:22:50.123]  It's the number one motivator, money.
[02:22:50.143 --> 02:22:50.684]  Okay?
[02:22:51.044 --> 02:22:52.385]  Most people grasp that.
[02:22:53.143 --> 02:23:02.247]  But when you talk about the elite class, and you say they want control, they want this, the general consensus from the average guy in the street is, that doesn't make any sense to me.
[02:23:02.647 --> 02:23:05.548]  They have all the money in the world, why would they do this?
[02:23:06.049 --> 02:23:10.570]  And this is what nobody can understand, because you don't have all the money in the world.
[02:23:11.231 --> 02:23:14.012]  When you have all the money you need or want,
[02:23:15.168 --> 02:23:16.949]  The motivation, then, is power.
[02:23:17.149 --> 02:23:18.390]  Well, power brings money.
[02:23:18.450 --> 02:23:19.471]  Power brings sex.
[02:23:19.931 --> 02:23:20.591]  It brings it all.
[02:23:20.952 --> 02:23:24.434]  Right, but power supersedes the motivation for money.
[02:23:24.794 --> 02:23:30.177]  It's power and control, which is why somebody who becomes incredibly wealthy gets what they want to do next.
[02:23:30.437 --> 02:23:31.538]  I want to get into politics.
[02:23:32.125 --> 02:23:33.526]  They want to start controlling things.
[02:23:33.866 --> 02:23:40.108]  So it's about control, and there's another thing that happens at the top level, and that's weird sexual deviations.
[02:23:40.489 --> 02:23:43.250]  Because people need some type of stimulation.
[02:23:43.570 --> 02:23:52.034]  And again, I physically have been around groups, and I've seen things, but you had the amazing experience of going to Bohemian Grove.
[02:23:52.074 --> 02:23:52.874]  I saw your video.
[02:23:54.002 --> 02:23:56.003]  So, I mean, you were there, right?
[02:23:56.523 --> 02:24:02.967]  Absolutely, and that's what's strange is that, go back to the Romans or the Aztecs, they're always a bunch of wild perverts.
[02:24:03.567 --> 02:24:03.887]  Correct.
[02:24:04.068 --> 02:24:19.496]  You were physically there, you had an experience that nobody could really grasp, you saw it with your own eyes, and I watched that DVD that you did, that documentary, it was extremely well done, and it gave, you know, just an insight that people don't have, maybe have a hard time grasping.
[02:24:19.696 --> 02:24:21.738]  And I was only in there for four hours and hiding out.
[02:24:22.458 --> 02:24:30.905]  The Vanity Fair guy got in and got arrested, but not before he admitted, oh yeah, the Christian conservatives are having homosexual orgies, but he says, oh, it's no big deal.
[02:24:31.226 --> 02:24:35.749]  The point is, is every time somebody claims they're a conservative, it's actually the opposite.
[02:24:37.471 --> 02:24:39.833]  I don't know, it's just so bizarre how weird these people are.
[02:24:40.914 --> 02:24:46.538]  It's very strange, and I think that people listening need to know, I think,
[02:24:47.458 --> 02:24:51.802]  From an economic standpoint, we have this huge tsunami coming.
[02:24:52.103 --> 02:24:53.304]  A huge hurricane.
[02:24:53.704 --> 02:24:54.385]  It is going to hit.
[02:24:54.825 --> 02:24:56.467]  People are going to be affected.
[02:24:57.102 --> 02:24:58.782]  Forget what you listen to on the news.
[02:24:59.163 --> 02:25:00.883]  It's going to get economically worse.
[02:25:00.943 --> 02:25:03.904]  Taxes are going up, your income is going down, fees are going up.
[02:25:04.364 --> 02:25:06.624]  There will be inflation to some degree.
[02:25:07.245 --> 02:25:08.385]  There will be inflation.
[02:25:08.465 --> 02:25:10.125]  What about a revolution when we come back?
[02:25:10.505 --> 02:25:13.086]  I mean, people are going to rebel as they raise taxes.
[02:25:13.306 --> 02:25:16.667]  Like, my property tax has gone up and my house value has gone down.
[02:25:16.687 --> 02:25:21.128]  We're going to come back in 70 seconds for 20 more minutes with Mr. Trudeau.
[02:25:21.368 --> 02:25:22.968]  The website is naturalcures.com.
[02:25:23.208 --> 02:25:25.129]  What's the site to get the financial books?
[02:25:25.909 --> 02:25:29.032]  That's at GlobalInformationNetwork.com.

[02:26:53.456 --> 02:26:55.357]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:26:55.857 --> 02:26:58.619]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:12.279 --> 02:27:17.244]  Alright, Kevin Trudeau, NaturalCures.com, gateway site to all his other great sites.
[02:27:17.264 --> 02:27:21.909]  Billions and millions of dollars a year in sales of books and other materials.
[02:27:21.989 --> 02:27:24.092]  He's one of the biggest best-selling authors out there.
[02:27:24.652 --> 02:27:34.262]  And I've, I mean, I've read several of his books, read news articles he's done, bought his, you know, Super Memory thing decades ago, and it's all
[02:27:35.023 --> 02:27:36.623]  Just stuff that's so well-documented.
[02:27:36.643 --> 02:27:39.684]  I mean, take his natural cures book that they don't want you to know about.
[02:27:39.704 --> 02:27:46.706]  This is all mainline stuff that's backed up by all these scientific studies that they've known for hundreds of years that it helps you.
[02:27:47.527 --> 02:27:48.987]  And then they're coming after him for that?
[02:27:49.047 --> 02:27:51.768]  Folks, this is serious if they're able to shut him down.
[02:27:52.108 --> 02:27:53.068]  What an amazing interview.
[02:27:53.428 --> 02:27:55.249]  Okay, we got 20 minutes left with
[02:27:55.709 --> 02:27:56.409]  Kevin Trudeau.
[02:27:56.429 --> 02:27:59.310]  We're going to open the phones up, take a few calls in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:59.330 --> 02:27:59.410]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:59.430 --> 02:28:02.192]  We just got a call from Trudeau's folks saying can they use this interview?
[02:28:02.212 --> 02:28:02.412]  Absolutely!
[02:28:02.432 --> 02:28:04.192]  They can take the video of this interview,
[02:28:11.215 --> 02:28:12.997]  The audio of it, use it however they want.
[02:28:13.617 --> 02:28:14.298]  Again, flattered.
[02:28:14.598 --> 02:28:20.404]  Okay, Kevin, I've been asking a lot of the questions, and there's so many other questions I've got, but in this short segment, we've got one more coming up.
[02:28:20.804 --> 02:28:31.074]  Anything else you haven't covered that people should know about, or that's coming over the horizon, that people aren't aware of yet, with all your inside knowledge, and what are you most focused on right now in the future?
[02:28:31.354 --> 02:28:35.676]  Well, for 15 years, Bilderberg, again, Bilderberg is just one group.
[02:28:35.756 --> 02:28:42.318]  It's North America and Europe, and there's others, about four others around the globe that also work together.
[02:28:42.698 --> 02:28:44.979]  And they are working together as a group.
[02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:53.783]  The bottom line is, there are six major areas of control that this group has been focused on forever.
[02:28:54.927 --> 02:28:56.768]  Number one is the money supply.
[02:28:57.149 --> 02:29:03.853]  So in 1913, when the Fed was created, they got the money supply covered in the U.S.
[02:29:04.233 --> 02:29:08.316]  So the number one goal is always to control the money.
[02:29:09.097 --> 02:29:12.159]  Number two is you've got to control the media.
[02:29:12.599 --> 02:29:19.804]  Because if you control television, radio, newspapers, magazines, then you control the thoughts and feelings of the population.
[02:29:20.685 --> 02:29:23.927]  The third thing they've got to do is control drugs and healthcare.
[02:29:24.690 --> 02:29:25.839]  Because everyone is going to...
[02:29:27.122 --> 02:29:31.204]  Either get sick or feel the urgency for their health.
[02:29:31.744 --> 02:29:38.206]  So if they control drugs and health care, that's an automatic way to control the population by forcing injections.
[02:29:38.226 --> 02:29:43.268]  You know, it's like this 13-year-old kid where the judge says, you must get chemotherapy.
[02:29:43.408 --> 02:29:44.589]  I mean, how insane is this?
[02:29:45.069 --> 02:29:46.790]  Strap the kid down and kill him?
[02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:48.630]  So that makes government God.
[02:29:48.650 --> 02:29:55.193]  I mean, if they can make you take drugs, make you go to them, get the health care they want to give you, that's how they force the eugenics on people.
[02:29:55.433 --> 02:30:02.794]  Yeah, and keep in mind the drugs are specifically used to basically mind down the individual population.
[02:30:03.114 --> 02:30:04.575]  This has been done throughout the centuries.
[02:30:04.615 --> 02:30:09.175]  We forget in China, when the British were in control of China, what did they do to the population?
[02:30:09.435 --> 02:30:10.516]  Let's get them all on opium!
[02:30:11.636 --> 02:30:21.137]  So they got up, the British got the entire Chinese population drugged up on opium so that they didn't have any problems with the population.
[02:30:21.157 --> 02:30:24.598]  They would just go out there and do their work and stay high on opium all day.
[02:30:25.379 --> 02:30:26.620]  So, same thing here.
[02:30:27.201 --> 02:30:29.383]  What are the elites afraid of?
[02:30:29.403 --> 02:30:31.345]  I asked you that question and forgot to ask it again.
[02:30:31.826 --> 02:30:32.987]  What are they most afraid of?
[02:30:33.467 --> 02:30:37.412]  They're afraid... This is the... It's so simple.
[02:30:37.732 --> 02:30:39.634]  Because people always ask me, what should I do?
[02:30:40.595 --> 02:30:42.116]  And this is what they're afraid of.
[02:30:42.377 --> 02:30:44.459]  They're afraid that people will get out of debt.
[02:30:45.495 --> 02:30:58.040]  Because if you completely pay off your credit cards, pay down your mortgage, you know, buy a used car for cash instead of owing money from the bank, if a person gets out of debt, they can't control you that much.
[02:30:58.540 --> 02:31:12.266]  And secondly, if you change where you spend your money, if you stop buying... See, you know, my book was the biggest seller that Walmart ever had.
[02:31:13.593 --> 02:31:15.353]  Walmart never sold organic food.
[02:31:16.174 --> 02:31:26.636]  So when Natural Cures became the best, biggest seller they ever had, the executives called me up and said, we are forced to sell organic food in our stores because of your damn book.
[02:31:28.616 --> 02:31:30.057]  And so that's what it comes down to.
[02:31:30.097 --> 02:31:32.857]  But they're greedy and can't help it and still sell your book.
[02:31:33.137 --> 02:31:33.598]  Correct!
[02:31:34.958 --> 02:31:35.958]  That's the beautiful thing.
[02:31:36.038 --> 02:31:37.478]  Greed supersedes everything.
[02:31:37.558 --> 02:31:40.079]  Even their most important wishes and desires.
[02:31:41.906 --> 02:31:47.348]  Well, that's just like big Hollywood production company with big banking funding making a Bilderberg Group movie.
[02:31:48.148 --> 02:31:50.990]  They like being known as the supermen of the world.
[02:31:51.010 --> 02:31:54.191]  I want to hear about those other four groups when we get back.
[02:31:54.331 --> 02:31:57.012]  Final segment with Kevin Trudeau, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:57.052 --> 02:31:58.152]  What an incredible interview.
[02:31:58.733 --> 02:32:00.153]  And we're going to be having him back up on the show.
[02:32:00.173 --> 02:32:00.933]  We appreciate his time.
[02:32:00.953 --> 02:32:01.374]  Hello, friends.
[02:32:01.414 --> 02:32:02.334]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.474 --> 02:32:05.395]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[02:32:05.435 --> 02:32:07.036]  And today that's more important than ever.
[02:32:07.216 --> 02:32:09.897]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[02:32:10.157 --> 02:32:13.179]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:32:13.199 --> 02:32:19.083]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:32:19.283 --> 02:32:22.245]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation with you.
[02:32:22.525 --> 02:32:29.449]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:32:29.549 --> 02:32:32.551]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:32:32.671 --> 02:32:33.051]  We're good to go!
[02:33:00.501 --> 02:33:05.809]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:33:06.310 --> 02:33:13.301]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:33:13.880 --> 02:33:20.065]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:33:20.405 --> 02:33:22.307]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:33:22.447 --> 02:33:24.869]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:33:24.949 --> 02:33:35.898]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:33:36.514 --> 02:33:37.795]  It's not about left or right.
[02:33:38.175 --> 02:33:39.576]  It's about a one world government.
[02:33:40.037 --> 02:33:46.402]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:33:55.229 --> 02:33:56.370]  The Obama Deception.
[02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:57.991]  The people strike back.
[02:33:59.667 --> 02:34:03.970]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:06.591]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[02:34:06.751 --> 02:34:16.237]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[02:34:16.237 --> 02:34:16.717]  We're good to go.
[02:34:35.366 --> 02:34:35.967]  I don't know.
[02:35:00.788 --> 02:35:05.832]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:06.192 --> 02:35:08.474]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:35:24.272 --> 02:35:35.178]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to know what a police state this country is, I had Jim Tucker on from Bilderberg three or four times, and I said, Jim, anything I can do for you, you know, for all the great work you've done?
[02:35:35.198 --> 02:35:37.319]  And he said, yeah, there's a type of bourbon I like.
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:39.180]  And he said the name of it.
[02:35:39.881 --> 02:35:46.324]  And then we're trying to mail it to the post office, and their little secret police asking what it is, and they say, we can't mail liquor across state lines.
[02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:52.688]  In America, you can't mail one of your friends a bottle of whiskey as a present.
[02:35:53.229 --> 02:35:54.419]  This country is gone!
[02:35:55.526 --> 02:35:56.547]  We got to take it back.
[02:35:56.587 --> 02:35:57.727]  We got to have a revolution.
[02:35:58.348 --> 02:36:04.092]  And Kevin Trudeau, how do we... Is the establishment worried about revolution?
[02:36:04.592 --> 02:36:05.993]  What type of revolution should we have?
[02:36:06.053 --> 02:36:08.315]  I want to have a peaceful one, but I want this to stop.
[02:36:08.355 --> 02:36:14.359]  I mean, I can't go out in the country on my land and get a telescope out without a game warden with his lights up running up now.
[02:36:14.619 --> 02:36:15.699]  It didn't used to be like that.
[02:36:15.740 --> 02:36:17.721]  I mean, government is out of control.
[02:36:17.761 --> 02:36:23.765]  They're suing you, getting $37 million judgments for writing books about how to lose weight that work.
[02:36:23.825 --> 02:36:25.306]  I mean, this is baloney!
[02:36:25.966 --> 02:36:37.812]  It really is a little bit outrageous, but actually, I look at it as a very positive thing because it's becoming so outrageous, people are now becoming aware.
[02:36:38.692 --> 02:36:51.919]  Because it's so outrageous, like this 13-year-old boy being forced to get chemotherapy, me, writing a book that the government doesn't like, and fining me $37 million, but also, in addition to that,
[02:36:52.751 --> 02:36:57.694]  I have been banned from appearing on television for the next three years.
[02:36:58.275 --> 02:37:02.197]  As a matter of fact, I've been banned from appearing on radio and internet shows.
[02:37:02.938 --> 02:37:04.919]  What I'm doing right now is illegal.
[02:37:05.119 --> 02:37:10.783]  Oh, I didn't know I was a thought criminal, but I, you know what, I believe in the First Amendment, hang together, hang separate.
[02:37:10.963 --> 02:37:12.404]  Tell me about my thought crime.
[02:37:13.805 --> 02:37:14.525]  Having you on.
[02:37:14.806 --> 02:37:19.689]  I'm the one breaking it because I'm banned from doing any media appearance for three years.
[02:37:20.342 --> 02:37:25.587]  But I just told him, look, if you want to enforce this ban, sue me again!
[02:37:27.008 --> 02:37:27.588]  Please!
[02:37:28.389 --> 02:37:37.317]  Well, you know, as you said, you're appealing all of this, and if they try to say you can't come on my show, I mean, that's really gonna illustrate to people that there's just no free speech left.
[02:37:37.839 --> 02:37:45.142]  It's really outrageous, but you ask me what they're afraid of, and again, let me tell people, here are the things that they're controlling, and then I'll tell you the three things they're afraid of.
[02:37:45.482 --> 02:37:53.066]  They're controlling the money, the media, the drugs and the healthcare, the food, water, and roads and travel.
[02:37:53.466 --> 02:37:59.729]  That's what the groups, now there's a group, again, Bilderberg, they call it Bilderberg because of the hotel, but there's no names for these.
[02:38:00.809 --> 02:38:02.770]  That is North America and Europe.
[02:38:03.186 --> 02:38:06.836]  There's a group that handles Central America and South America.
[02:38:07.257 --> 02:38:09.684]  There's the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.
[02:38:10.125 --> 02:38:11.950]  There's Africa and then there's Asia.
[02:38:12.563 --> 02:38:17.826]  Those, all of those have Bilderberg-type groups that are all working together.
[02:38:18.106 --> 02:38:26.372]  And then all these tie in, and this is where, at the level that I was at, it's an organization that we don't have a name for.
[02:38:26.892 --> 02:38:31.815]  It's called the Brotherhood only because it's just the people together as brothers.
[02:38:31.915 --> 02:38:33.256]  It's men and women, but mostly men.
[02:38:33.276 --> 02:38:40.080]  And we basically try to make sure that we control the money, the media, the food, the drugs, the water, and the roads.
[02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:41.321]  What are
[02:38:42.122 --> 02:38:42.822]  They afraid of?
[02:38:42.862 --> 02:38:50.065]  They're afraid of A, that you stop, in America, that you stop voting for Democrats and Republicans and vote for any other party.
[02:38:50.285 --> 02:38:51.606]  Break the left-right paradigm!
[02:38:51.926 --> 02:38:57.448]  They are freaking out at guys like Ron Paul, and if you remember, remember Ross Perot?
[02:38:57.928 --> 02:38:58.188]  Yes.
[02:38:58.488 --> 02:39:08.312]  Hey, why, isn't it bizarre that this guy was on the news, on television every day, and then, overnight, you never heard another word from him ever again.
[02:39:08.332 --> 02:39:09.993]  Because they said they'd kill his family.
[02:39:10.399 --> 02:39:12.900]  Of course they said they'd kill his family.
[02:39:13.940 --> 02:39:15.121]  But they wouldn't kill him.
[02:39:15.621 --> 02:39:20.142]  They were going to murder him in the press, just like Ron Emanuel told the bomb holders at Chrysler.
[02:39:20.783 --> 02:39:26.425]  He said, if you don't go along with this, we're going to send the IRS after you and we're going to unleash the press corps.
[02:39:27.065 --> 02:39:30.306]  Yeah, well this mafia government, like the Nazis, that was a mafia government.
[02:39:30.326 --> 02:39:31.506]  The Soviets, mafia government.
[02:39:31.806 --> 02:39:35.288]  Don't you see it falling apart as their crimes get more and more legion?
[02:39:36.530 --> 02:39:36.950]  That's it.
[02:39:37.210 --> 02:39:40.152]  The more crazy they get, the more people start making changes.
[02:39:40.192 --> 02:39:41.693]  So, number one, get out of debt.
[02:39:41.713 --> 02:39:45.434]  Number two, never vote for a Democrat or Republican with the exception of Ron Paul.
[02:39:45.935 --> 02:39:47.636]  And number three, change your buying habits.
[02:39:47.656 --> 02:39:50.037]  Stop buying things from big multinational companies.
[02:39:50.657 --> 02:39:51.558]  I'm in Germany right now.
[02:39:51.578 --> 02:39:53.419]  I'm talking to guys who are 80 years old.
[02:39:53.999 --> 02:39:56.080]  Now, people are a little healthier here.
[02:39:56.100 --> 02:39:56.860]  They ride bikes.
[02:39:56.900 --> 02:39:58.601]  They hike up the mountain at 80 years old.
[02:39:58.641 --> 02:39:59.722]  No one's taking any drugs.
[02:40:00.202 --> 02:40:06.225]  But these guys and gals I'm chatting with here in Germany were around during Adolf Hitler.
[02:40:06.778 --> 02:40:07.599]  And you know what they tell me?
[02:40:08.059 --> 02:40:11.481]  They look at me like, they say, are you Americans crazy?
[02:40:12.081 --> 02:40:16.504]  You are doing the exact same thing that we did under Adolf Hitler.
[02:40:16.905 --> 02:40:21.888]  We wanted to give up our freedoms so that he could protect us.
[02:40:22.648 --> 02:40:25.210]  You are doing the exact same thing in America.
[02:40:25.945 --> 02:40:44.291]  And it's common knowledge here from the people that were around during the regime of Adolf Hitler that America and Britain are becoming this generation's most totalitarianism, totalitarian and tyrannical fascist governments on planet Earth.
[02:40:44.571 --> 02:40:45.332]  Let me back you up.
[02:40:45.612 --> 02:40:47.413]  Let me back you up and then finish because it's so important.
[02:41:15.372 --> 02:41:15.672]  We don't.
[02:41:15.712 --> 02:41:17.093]  We don't have free speech at all.
[02:41:17.153 --> 02:41:24.560]  When a guy can get sued 37 million dollars because he wrote a book and expressed his opinions on television, we don't have free speech in America?
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:25.000]  No.
[02:41:25.100 --> 02:41:25.501]  I agree.
[02:41:25.661 --> 02:41:25.941]  I agree.
[02:41:25.961 --> 02:41:30.085]  Finish your point though that I interrupted about the Nazi Germany parallel.
[02:41:30.145 --> 02:41:34.629]  Well, the point that people in America need to know because the debate is
[02:41:35.208 --> 02:41:38.930]  Hey, isn't it good that we keep these prisoners in Guantanamo?
[02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:42.352]  Isn't it good that the government would be given powers to protect us?
[02:41:42.772 --> 02:41:44.413]  And it sounds really good.
[02:41:44.854 --> 02:41:48.596]  The problem is, when they take your brother-in-law away, then what are you going to do?
[02:41:49.659 --> 02:41:56.560]  Well, and now they admit the Patriot Act and Homeland Security is for gun owners, conservatives, Ron Paul supporters, and returning veterans.
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:58.581]  We're told it's for these brown people.
[02:41:59.201 --> 02:42:02.301]  It's designed specifically not to be used.
[02:42:02.741 --> 02:42:06.342]  It's designed to be used as an intimidation and fear tactic.
[02:42:06.722 --> 02:42:09.082]  Just like the Gestapo during the Second World War.
[02:42:09.442 --> 02:42:17.904]  People were afraid to have conversations in coffee shops because if they said anything against the Führer, the Gestapo, if they were listening, or
[02:42:18.704 --> 02:42:23.888]  One of their Hitler Youth was listening in and reported you to Gestapo.
[02:42:24.268 --> 02:42:25.589]  They would take you in for questioning.
[02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:28.292]  And generally, the first time, they wouldn't do anything.
[02:42:28.752 --> 02:42:31.294]  But you would crap your pants out of fear.
[02:42:32.174 --> 02:42:33.095]  And that's what it's about.
[02:42:33.115 --> 02:42:44.304]  It's about... And by the way, by the way, as you know, they're now having Obama's youth brigades that are in military formations in uniforms, red and black, knock on your door and ask, we're just canvassing.
[02:42:44.524 --> 02:42:47.066]  Do you support the leader, the president, the fuhrer?
[02:42:48.627 --> 02:42:49.948]  Yeah, Chairman Obama.
[02:42:51.909 --> 02:42:53.349]  What do the elites think of Obama?
[02:42:53.389 --> 02:42:56.931]  Because I confirmed from Estill and Ann Tucker he was at Bilderberg last year.
[02:42:56.971 --> 02:42:59.452]  Did you hear anything about him at Bilderberg last year?
[02:42:59.692 --> 02:43:03.494]  Well, the reason he was selected over Hillary is simple.
[02:43:05.315 --> 02:43:08.816]  Hillary had a huge amount of people that hated her.
[02:43:09.156 --> 02:43:09.737]  Negatives, yeah.
[02:43:10.157 --> 02:43:12.238]  Okay, and Obama didn't.
[02:43:12.718 --> 02:43:17.220]  And they also picked Obama because the bottom line is they were looking for somebody who was a great
[02:43:18.035 --> 02:43:21.396]  Speaker, and who's going to persuade people.
[02:43:22.597 --> 02:43:25.518]  He reads that teleprompter so well.
[02:43:25.798 --> 02:43:29.679]  I mean, this is what people don't get.
[02:43:30.019 --> 02:43:35.141]  I was with a couple Senators, and I was with them to see what they do all day.
[02:43:36.121 --> 02:43:37.641]  It's a professional acting job.
[02:43:38.762 --> 02:43:41.983]  They spend 97, 70% of their day for raising money.
[02:43:42.983 --> 02:43:45.084]  They don't read any of the bills they sign.
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:48.242]  They don't write any of the bills they sponsor.
[02:43:49.143 --> 02:43:51.625]  It's a complete acting job in Washington.
[02:43:52.345 --> 02:43:53.646]  What about the tipping point?
[02:43:53.687 --> 02:43:56.269]  You know, it's not just that the good guys are going to help us win.
[02:43:56.289 --> 02:43:58.290]  1% started the war in 1775.
[02:43:58.991 --> 02:44:00.492]  5% won the war.
[02:44:00.552 --> 02:44:01.513]  We don't need a majority.
[02:44:01.533 --> 02:44:02.393]  We've got way more than 5%.
[02:44:02.654 --> 02:44:05.836]  Probably like 20% know what's going on now from my own gauge.
[02:44:05.856 --> 02:44:08.398]  I can get your expert take on that and really want it.
[02:44:09.479 --> 02:44:10.140]  I'm interested to know.
[02:44:11.775 --> 02:44:20.477]  But there's going to be a lot of people who are members of the elite, different strata of the elite, are going to also see that we're starting to win, and they're going to jump ship over to our side.
[02:44:20.777 --> 02:44:22.278]  I'm already seeing more and more of that.
[02:44:22.338 --> 02:44:32.920]  So, believing we can win and get going in the direction of liberty again, a tipping point, getting the pendulum swinging, that's really doable if we just believe in it and act like winners.
[02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:37.701]  Well, what you just said there is very, very astute.
[02:44:38.221 --> 02:44:40.082]  And this is what most people don't understand.
[02:44:40.834 --> 02:44:45.076]  If you look, for example, at all the wars, Switzerland's always neutral.
[02:44:45.496 --> 02:44:46.476]  And nobody touches them.
[02:44:46.536 --> 02:44:46.796]  Why?
[02:44:46.816 --> 02:44:47.936]  Because that's where all the cash is.
[02:44:48.957 --> 02:44:53.198]  But every war, it doesn't matter who wins.
[02:44:54.959 --> 02:44:55.619]  Do you understand?
[02:44:55.639 --> 02:44:56.860]  It's irrelevant.
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:03.662]  So, at our levels, we don't care who wins the war.
[02:45:04.682 --> 02:45:05.443]  It's a yawn!
[02:45:05.483 --> 02:45:08.547]  It's like, okay, it doesn't matter because... It's who profits.
[02:45:08.747 --> 02:45:09.848]  We're like Don King!
[02:45:09.868 --> 02:45:11.630]  We own both fighters!
[02:45:13.012 --> 02:45:14.333]  It doesn't matter!
[02:45:14.974 --> 02:45:18.839]  It's about playing that war, playing all the sides to your best profit.
[02:45:19.332 --> 02:45:19.692]  Correct!
[02:45:19.993 --> 02:45:25.136]  And it doesn't matter who wins, because we own both sides.
[02:45:25.396 --> 02:45:31.461]  And that's why they want the Afghan and Iraq war to go on and on, because it's nothing but a black hole to pump trillions into.
[02:45:31.961 --> 02:45:32.762]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:45:32.802 --> 02:45:42.669]  I mean, those wars are... I mean, keep in mind, America goes into wars around the world primarily to secure money for contractors and payoff friends.
[02:45:43.229 --> 02:45:47.272]  I mean, that's why you think France and Germany got so pissed off when America went into Iraq.
[02:45:47.572 --> 02:45:49.734]  Because they're the ones who had 90% of the contracts.
[02:45:50.434 --> 02:45:50.974]  Absolutely.
[02:45:51.195 --> 02:45:54.697]  And America went in and said, sorry, we're taking over the contracts.
[02:45:54.817 --> 02:45:57.099]  And that's why France and Germany got really mad.
[02:45:57.299 --> 02:46:01.362]  But suddenly they're on board with Iraq because they were given some of the contracts back.
[02:46:01.542 --> 02:46:01.882]  Correct.
[02:46:03.157 --> 02:46:05.479]  That's what people don't understand.
[02:46:05.519 --> 02:46:11.025]  When we went into Iraq, before we went in, people don't know this, but there were like group meetings.
[02:46:11.485 --> 02:46:14.048]  How to profit from the upcoming Iraqi war.
[02:46:14.468 --> 02:46:16.330]  And these are business symposiums.
[02:46:16.989 --> 02:46:17.610]  Listen, listen!
[02:46:35.529 --> 02:46:40.110]  Kevin Trudeau, I mean, I've seen in the Enron, smartest guys in the room, they have video of those meetings.
[02:46:40.410 --> 02:46:43.411]  You know what, I've twisted your arm, but you said you'd stay longer.
[02:46:43.471 --> 02:46:47.352]  Do one more short segment so we can put a nice bow on this.
[02:46:47.372 --> 02:46:48.032]  Of course, of course.
[02:46:48.473 --> 02:46:51.153]  One of the most amazing interviews I've ever done, it's with Kevin Trudeau.
[02:46:51.954 --> 02:46:53.934]  Just absolutely amazing.
[02:46:53.954 --> 02:46:56.155]  We'll give you all the websites and a lot more on the other side.
[02:46:56.415 --> 02:47:00.676]  Here's one of them, naturalcures.com, mysiteinfowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[02:47:01.337 --> 02:47:04.058]  If being prepared doesn't apply to you, disregard the next minute.
[02:47:04.518 --> 02:47:07.159]  We're way beyond a question of if and when it's upon us.
[02:47:07.599 --> 02:47:12.121]  When you can't safely touch anything and a cough or sneeze can shut down your school or business.
[02:47:12.501 --> 02:47:19.584]  How would you or could you disinfect a school bus, office, locker room, place of worship or your entire home and do it in just minutes?
[02:47:20.273 --> 02:47:29.037]  Go to hazard.com and see the 8-minute video that is guaranteed to show how our unique application process can do really big jobs that you never could do before.
[02:47:29.557 --> 02:47:31.898]  H-A-Z-A-R-I-D.
[02:47:32.418 --> 02:47:36.060]  Total protection kits kill viruses, bacteria, mold, and much more.
[02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:38.981]  And they do it for less cost than what you're currently using.
[02:47:39.597 --> 02:47:42.640]  Don't risk facing shipping bottlenecks and possible shortages.
[02:47:43.161 --> 02:47:48.446]  Act now to assure prompt delivery and to receive our two-for-one double product special.
[02:47:48.606 --> 02:47:50.087]  You can't buy Hazurid in stores.
[02:47:50.568 --> 02:47:53.371]  Order online at Hazurid.com or call 800-675-0323.
[02:47:53.391 --> 02:47:53.591]  That's 800-675-0323.
[02:48:00.623 --> 02:48:06.849]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:48:07.310 --> 02:48:15.078]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:48:15.418 --> 02:48:21.004]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:48:21.337 --> 02:48:23.279]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[02:48:23.579 --> 02:48:28.343]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:48:28.683 --> 02:48:33.387]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:48:33.907 --> 02:48:37.750]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:48:38.251 --> 02:48:39.272]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:48:39.332 --> 02:48:43.415]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:48:43.835 --> 02:48:45.216]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:48:48.726 --> 02:48:51.288]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:48:53.490 --> 02:48:53.730]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:56.192]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:49:06.634 --> 02:49:11.977]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:49:12.518 --> 02:49:18.701]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:49:19.002 --> 02:49:20.823]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:49:20.983 --> 02:49:23.364]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:49:23.444 --> 02:49:34.331]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:49:36.616 --> 02:49:37.877]  It's not about left or right.
[02:49:38.277 --> 02:49:39.658]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:49:40.138 --> 02:49:46.462]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:49:47.063 --> 02:49:54.848]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:55.328 --> 02:49:56.469]  The Obama Deception.
[02:49:56.889 --> 02:49:58.090]  The people strike back.
[02:49:59.895 --> 02:50:04.778]  Since 1991, The Seven Store has been helping you prepare in the event of an emergency.

[02:50:12.663 --> 02:50:16.125]  At The Seven Store, we do something very different for our customers.

[02:50:50.121 --> 02:50:51.102]  Or call us today at 888-654-3447.
[02:50:51.182 --> 02:50:51.402]  That's 888-654-3447.
[02:51:05.356 --> 02:51:06.376]  Boy, he is something else.
[02:51:06.397 --> 02:51:07.837]  You know why the man is after him.
[02:51:07.877 --> 02:51:08.578]  Kevin Trudeau.
[02:51:08.758 --> 02:51:10.198]  I can find no fault with this guy.
[02:51:10.318 --> 02:51:11.119]  I just agree with him.
[02:51:11.719 --> 02:51:12.459]  On every front.
[02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:15.341]  You know, also...
[02:51:16.457 --> 02:51:23.682]  The nouveau riche, the new wealth, the middle class, some of the even ultra-rich who are new money, they realize the elite's waging war on them.
[02:51:23.922 --> 02:51:44.075]  What about how the globalists are now, after 500 years, going after Switzerland, shaking down the smaller accounts but leaving the big juicy ones alone, and then David Rockefeller's bragging about they're going to end all tax havens, set a global tax rate to the OECD, end quote tax havens, open announcements of world government with these bankers running it.
[02:51:44.576 --> 02:51:46.117]  I think this tiny elite
[02:51:46.657 --> 02:51:48.438]  Well, there's an interesting concept about this.
[02:51:48.458 --> 02:51:50.259]  And let me just put it to you this way.
[02:51:50.279 --> 02:51:54.601]  From the guys that I hang around with, I mean, you know, maybe they manage a $10 billion hedge fund.
[02:51:54.621 --> 02:52:00.984]  You know, one guy last year, you know, netted a couple hundred million dollars.
[02:52:01.024 --> 02:52:03.766]  And when I chat with these guys about taxes,
[02:52:16.457 --> 02:52:21.179]  They laugh because to them it's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:26.322]  Look, we pay a little bit of tax, but it's nothing.
[02:52:26.762 --> 02:52:30.884]  It's nothing like people think we're going to pay because they're
[02:52:31.775 --> 02:52:32.615]  I mean, the U.S.
[02:52:32.716 --> 02:52:35.417]  tax code, nobody can even understand it.
[02:52:35.837 --> 02:52:39.419]  Well, it's written for the elites to pay just a few percent, and the people are paying 40.
[02:52:39.739 --> 02:52:39.979]  Correct.
[02:52:40.059 --> 02:52:42.601]  I mean, listen, I have corporations in Switzerland.
[02:52:43.081 --> 02:52:44.842]  And, you know, they have the best roads in the world.
[02:52:45.042 --> 02:52:47.684]  You're in Chicago, or in Austin, I was down there.
[02:52:47.924 --> 02:52:51.205]  It's like driving on, as Man Cow says, it's like driving on the surface of the moon.
[02:52:51.426 --> 02:52:53.126]  You know, craters everywhere, right?
[02:52:53.547 --> 02:52:57.249]  Well, I'm driving around Germany, and I cannot find one, not one, pothole.
[02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:57.729]  Not one.
[02:53:00.023 --> 02:53:00.504]  But guess what?
[02:53:00.524 --> 02:53:01.584]  They have to pay for that.
[02:53:01.985 --> 02:53:05.488]  They build the roads the last 25 years, not five like they do in the U.S.
[02:53:06.300 --> 02:53:07.461]  So you have to pay for that.
[02:53:07.941 --> 02:53:14.405]  So, when I set up a company in Switzerland, for example, they say, look, the taxes are 10% or 12% or 15%, and you pay it!
[02:53:14.786 --> 02:53:16.567]  Because there's good infrastructure and things.
[02:53:17.828 --> 02:53:18.348]  No problem!
[02:53:18.368 --> 02:53:20.950]  It's like buying a good steak!
[02:53:21.170 --> 02:53:22.851]  But you get good value for your money!
[02:53:23.331 --> 02:53:30.516]  In the U.S., when you pay your taxes, it goes paying interest on the government's debt, and it's going to the bankers!
[02:53:31.988 --> 02:53:33.229]  You're not getting any of the information.
[02:53:33.249 --> 02:53:38.634]  Are Americans, Kevin Gerdoa, are Americans known as the schmucks of the world now?
[02:53:39.655 --> 02:53:40.215]  The suckers.
[02:53:40.375 --> 02:53:41.236]  The word is suckers.
[02:53:42.778 --> 02:53:44.499]  The Americans are the suckers.
[02:53:45.580 --> 02:53:46.841]  There's no question about it.
[02:53:47.262 --> 02:53:52.006]  Is it because we were so free and, you know, had it so good that we kind of sat on our laurels?
[02:53:52.771 --> 02:54:00.719]  I think it's because the media in America brainwashes people to have them believe things should be a certain way.
[02:54:01.139 --> 02:54:03.742]  The majority of Americans have never left the United States.
[02:54:03.802 --> 02:54:04.743]  Let me just give you an example.
[02:54:04.883 --> 02:54:06.945]  You're driving down the road in America, right?
[02:54:07.265 --> 02:54:08.466]  You stop at a gas station.
[02:54:08.967 --> 02:54:09.788]  You go to the bathroom.
[02:54:11.930 --> 02:54:13.651]  Is it the cleanest place in the world?
[02:54:14.272 --> 02:54:14.452]  No.
[02:54:14.472 --> 02:54:16.174]  I mean, it's disgusting, right?
[02:54:16.758 --> 02:54:21.383]  You're in Europe, you stop at a gas station, you walk in, you go to the bathroom, it's spotless!
[02:54:21.483 --> 02:54:22.804]  There's an attendant there!
[02:54:23.905 --> 02:54:24.165]  Okay?
[02:54:24.265 --> 02:54:26.568]  You're in America, you stop at a gas station, you want something to eat?
[02:54:27.088 --> 02:54:29.791]  Well, how about this three-week-old sandwich in the back?
[02:54:30.655 --> 02:54:30.875]  Right?
[02:54:30.895 --> 02:54:31.896]  You know what I'm talking about?
[02:54:31.916 --> 02:54:32.877]  There's no food.
[02:54:33.517 --> 02:54:36.699]  In Europe, you walk into a gas station, you want something to eat?
[02:54:36.719 --> 02:54:43.003]  There's a chef and a kitchen and all the fruits and vegetables are organic because they don't allow genetically modified stuff.
[02:54:43.043 --> 02:54:47.086]  The people demand quality and here we were sold on crap.
[02:54:47.366 --> 02:54:48.206]  That's correct.
[02:54:48.707 --> 02:54:56.392]  Just like McDonald's 50 years ago would put a trash can there and say thank you and we like idiots would go throw our trash away and just lowering the standard.
[02:54:56.909 --> 02:54:57.309]  Correct.
[02:54:57.849 --> 02:54:58.729]  Correct, correct, correct.
[02:54:58.749 --> 02:55:02.990]  So the bottom line is people in America just don't know anymore how things should be.
[02:55:03.010 --> 02:55:05.251]  I mean, we just don't get it.
[02:55:05.891 --> 02:55:09.332]  I mean, if you look at a cookbook in America, and it says this is home cooking.
[02:55:10.132 --> 02:55:10.712]  Ingredients.
[02:55:11.212 --> 02:55:14.093]  One can of mushroom, cream of mushroom soup.
[02:55:14.713 --> 02:55:16.113]  That's not how you make something.
[02:55:16.153 --> 02:55:19.614]  You don't use a can of cream of mushroom soup in a homemade recipe.
[02:55:20.458 --> 02:55:20.938]  You know what?
[02:55:21.038 --> 02:55:21.879]  I disagree with you.
[02:55:21.899 --> 02:55:24.841]  We're going to have you arrested for saying what a home-cooked meal is.
[02:55:24.861 --> 02:55:26.042]  You don't have free speech.
[02:55:26.623 --> 02:55:28.124]  You don't have free speech, Kevin Trudeau.
[02:55:28.164 --> 02:55:30.426]  Kevin, in closing, I know I gave the number out.
[02:55:30.466 --> 02:55:31.206]  We have loaded phones.
[02:55:31.226 --> 02:55:34.289]  I forgot to go to your calls, and I'm going to let Kevin go here in a moment.
[02:55:34.509 --> 02:55:36.590]  But, Kevin, when you get back to the U.S.
[02:55:36.630 --> 02:55:39.913]  or in the next couple of weeks or in the next month, can we have you back up and take calls?
[02:55:40.393 --> 02:55:40.894]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:55:40.914 --> 02:55:42.879]  What I'll do is when I get back, I'll call you.
[02:55:42.919 --> 02:55:44.884]  I'll fly down to Austin for a couple days.
[02:55:45.224 --> 02:55:46.267]  I'll come on the show.
[02:55:46.848 --> 02:55:50.416]  You and I will have a chance to have a good meal and beer and have some fun as well.
[02:55:50.782 --> 02:55:57.429]  Man, I can't wait to meet you in person, and I'm really glad that we got in touch through Man Cal, and it's just been wonderful having you here.
[02:55:57.470 --> 02:56:06.840]  Folks can also go to your kind of master portal website, kevintrudeau.com, and that goes to the entire family of sites.
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:10.965]  And you're not just the king of infomercials, you started the Golf Channel and a bunch of other channels.
[02:56:11.645 --> 02:56:13.508]  Kevin Trudeau, an amazing individual.
[02:56:13.548 --> 02:56:16.892]  Trudeau is spelled T-R-U-D-E-A-U.
[02:56:17.333 --> 02:56:20.698]  So KevinTrudeau.com or NaturalCures.com.
[02:56:20.738 --> 02:56:23.121]  And what's the big mega information site name again?
[02:56:23.161 --> 02:56:25.524]  That's the Global Information Network.
[02:56:25.664 --> 02:56:27.286]  GlobalInformationNetwork.com.
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:33.822]  Well, just an incredible hour and a 20 minute conversation with Kevin Trudeau.
[02:56:34.222 --> 02:56:35.843]  And we hope that, well, you know what?
[02:56:36.343 --> 02:56:38.624]  They've told him he has no free speech, but he's saying, you know what?
[02:56:38.684 --> 02:56:39.565]  I'm innately free.
[02:56:39.585 --> 02:56:40.365]  He's speaking out.
[02:56:40.625 --> 02:56:41.766]  He's ignoring what they've said.
[02:56:41.786 --> 02:56:43.386]  And we salute you, Kevin Trudeau.
[02:56:43.406 --> 02:56:44.347]  We'll talk to you very soon.
[02:56:44.687 --> 02:56:45.067]  Sounds good.
[02:56:45.087 --> 02:56:45.807]  Have a great day, Alex.
[02:56:45.827 --> 02:56:49.048]  All right, let me say bye to you during this break, and I'll let you get back to what you're doing there in Germany.
[02:56:49.369 --> 02:56:50.069]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:56:50.109 --> 02:56:50.989]  Masses of news coming up.

[02:58:01.344 --> 02:58:06.667]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:58:07.167 --> 02:58:14.131]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:58:14.719 --> 02:58:20.921]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:58:21.321 --> 02:58:23.141]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:58:23.281 --> 02:58:25.702]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:58:25.782 --> 02:58:36.725]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:58:37.365 --> 02:58:38.645]  It's not about left or right.
[02:58:39.046 --> 02:58:40.406]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:58:40.896 --> 02:58:47.204]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:58:56.074 --> 02:58:57.216]  The Obama Deception.
[02:58:57.636 --> 02:58:58.838]  The people strike back.
[02:59:00.629 --> 02:59:03.670]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[02:59:04.030 --> 02:59:08.251]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[02:59:08.471 --> 02:59:10.651]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[02:59:10.991 --> 02:59:16.952]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[02:59:17.252 --> 02:59:23.634]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[02:59:24.814 --> 02:59:26.856]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[03:00:29.656 --> 03:00:35.903]  Yeah, about a year ago, Rob Jacobson said, you want to do infomercials like Kevin Trudeau.
[03:00:36.144 --> 03:00:42.011]  And I said, you know man, I can barely figure out how to balance my checkbook and move into a bigger office, but we've gotten to the next level.
[03:00:42.491 --> 03:00:44.574]  We just need the support to go to the level after that.
[03:00:45.515 --> 03:00:47.618]  And Kevin Trudeau is definitely something else.
[03:00:49.537 --> 03:00:51.258]  The guy does make billions of dollars a year.
[03:00:52.178 --> 03:00:59.861]  And I was talking to him during the breaks, he's probably listening right now, Mr. Trudeau, he really knows the show, he really listens to it routinely.
[03:01:00.981 --> 03:01:13.886]  It's incredible when I found out that one of the large parties in Japan has meetings watching my videos, you know, in the Parliament offices, and Bilderberg Group members know who I am, and track and follow what I do.
[03:01:14.226 --> 03:01:17.848]  Estalin told me about a Bilderberg Group person who saw the Obama deception,
[03:01:19.420 --> 03:01:21.721]  But he didn't expressly say I could talk about it.
[03:01:23.162 --> 03:01:28.464]  He told me not to talk about the people that bought Terminator, but not Terminator, and then his movie, and now they're announcing it.
[03:01:28.544 --> 03:01:29.704]  Two years ago, I didn't talk about it.
[03:01:30.364 --> 03:01:31.605]  I mean, who can make this stuff up?
[03:01:31.665 --> 03:01:32.385]  It's just too weird.
[03:01:32.625 --> 03:01:34.566]  My wife thinks we live in the Matrix or something.
[03:01:34.586 --> 03:01:35.706]  I mean, a literal Matrix.
[03:01:36.027 --> 03:01:39.088]  She's starting to think that, not just a phony left-right Matrix.
[03:01:40.009 --> 03:01:42.052]  I mean, this is all a delusion.
[03:01:42.092 --> 03:01:43.734]  I'm not a syndicated radio talk show host.
[03:01:43.794 --> 03:01:45.196]  I'm already in Hollywood films.
[03:01:45.637 --> 03:01:47.921]  I haven't made some of the most viral internet videos.
[03:01:48.241 --> 03:01:49.303]  I don't know all these people.
[03:01:49.703 --> 03:01:55.231]  Because the stuff I can't talk about on air is ten times wilder than what you were just hearing on air.
[03:01:56.482 --> 03:02:00.326]  And then meanwhile, at night last night, I was just all sitting there for hours.
[03:02:00.366 --> 03:02:16.862]  I couldn't sleep writing notes and thinking about the New World Order and all these things I wanted to impart to humanity about the nature of the human spirit and our future and all this news I wanted to cover and literally 50 articles I printed off and was going to cover each one on air today and the whole show just blew past us.
[03:02:17.123 --> 03:02:20.106]  And we covered a lot, but it's just crazy.
[03:02:21.246 --> 03:02:24.849]  Meanwhile, for all my petty power, I can't get rid of the fruit flies here in the office.
[03:02:27.791 --> 03:02:29.532]  The stuff Trudeau was telling me off-air.
[03:02:30.253 --> 03:02:30.893]  Oh my God.
[03:02:30.913 --> 03:02:35.376]  And I believe all of that, because I know he jet-sets around with those people.
[03:02:36.097 --> 03:02:38.779]  But to have Trudeau on here talking about Bilderberg Group meeting...
[03:02:40.299 --> 03:02:45.863]  And that's exactly who they'd want there, is people that have, you know, have this influence outside their control.
[03:02:46.223 --> 03:02:50.206]  They usually have about 7 to 15 members of the press or alternative media, they try to get there.
[03:02:50.686 --> 03:02:52.327]  And of course they would have Kevin Trudeau there.
[03:02:53.027 --> 03:02:55.809]  But he was basically saying he was at the German meeting four years ago.
[03:02:57.070 --> 03:02:59.572]  So, in Rotterdam.
[03:03:01.193 --> 03:03:02.874]  Okay, you know what, I said I'd take calls.
[03:03:04.115 --> 03:03:05.956]  By the way, John, I was busy.
[03:03:05.976 --> 03:03:07.417]  Did you ever check what gold is today?
[03:03:10.154 --> 03:03:12.257]  Well, here, I'm just going to do that right now myself.
[03:03:13.378 --> 03:03:15.360]  I'm just going to check this because I want to know what it is.
[03:03:15.661 --> 03:03:19.666]  I mean, it exploded last week and I didn't even cover it.
[03:03:21.007 --> 03:03:23.450]  I mean, it's up like 80-something, 90-something dollars.
[03:03:23.631 --> 03:03:24.532]  Yeah, click on that for me.
[03:03:25.773 --> 03:03:27.075]  Just absolutely incredible.
[03:03:27.175 --> 03:03:28.236]  Oh, it's down $3.
[03:03:32.532 --> 03:03:33.393]  At $9.52, which is up $52.20.
[03:03:33.433 --> 03:03:36.698]  $72 from two weeks ago, so just amazing that that is going on.
[03:03:46.172 --> 03:03:48.073]  You know, I said I would do justice to this.
[03:03:48.093 --> 03:03:49.433]  Hey, will you call Rob Dillon here?
[03:03:49.453 --> 03:03:51.214]  Because I want to take calls here at the end of the show.
[03:03:51.554 --> 03:03:54.115]  But I want to plan tomorrow's show and make some promises.
[03:03:54.135 --> 03:03:57.757]  Because I filled up like two notebooks of points I wanted to make the last few months.
[03:03:58.457 --> 03:04:00.438]  And then last night, I didn't have a notebook in bed.
[03:04:00.458 --> 03:04:02.359]  I was turning the light on and writing in the back of a...
[03:04:05.458 --> 03:04:06.399]  Pitcairn's Island.
[03:04:07.039 --> 03:04:09.961]  We bring my note, the blue notepad, my Pitcairn's Island.
[03:04:10.041 --> 03:04:12.263]  I was, I finished that book last night at about 2 a.m.
[03:04:12.283 --> 03:04:14.124]  and I was scribbling with the light on.
[03:04:14.144 --> 03:04:15.265]  My wife's like, what are you doing?
[03:04:15.926 --> 03:04:23.291]  And I'm, you know, got my book, Pitcairn's Island and my folder are sitting out there on the table.
[03:04:25.273 --> 03:04:27.995]  And there's all these important brainstorming points I've had.
[03:04:29.656 --> 03:04:31.838]  The biggest issue I've got to figure out is
[03:04:34.008 --> 03:04:37.250]  is whenever I scribble this stuff so fast it's hard to read later when I look at it.
[03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:43.094]  I've got all these notebooks and then I filled up the back of this book with notes last night.
[03:04:43.514 --> 03:04:48.577]  Then I ran out of time so I used a card by the bed to write notes.
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:04:53.780]  Rob New, come on in here.
[03:04:53.840 --> 03:04:58.563]  I want to know what the schedule is tomorrow so I can come in because these are important points.
[03:04:59.758 --> 03:05:03.040]  Or I may just start a thing like where I have a live video feed by my bed.
[03:05:03.060 --> 03:05:08.564]  Because it's always when I'm trying to go to sleep that all this stuff is racing through my head and it all makes sense and I know how to explain it.
[03:05:08.965 --> 03:05:10.186]  Is it the same way for you guys?
[03:05:10.966 --> 03:05:13.488]  When you're going to bed at night, it's when your brain really works the best?
[03:05:14.189 --> 03:05:14.729]  Definitely.
[03:05:15.390 --> 03:05:17.511]  And I need to have a video cam there.
[03:05:17.531 --> 03:05:19.593]  And my wife's snoring.
[03:05:19.613 --> 03:05:20.653]  She doesn't snore too loud.
[03:05:21.234 --> 03:05:22.375]  It's kind of a cute little snore.
[03:05:23.168 --> 03:05:24.289]  Like a little piglet or something.
[03:05:24.789 --> 03:05:27.452]  I'm like, uh, she says I smell like a rhinoceros.
[03:05:27.472 --> 03:05:29.273]  I'll be like, stop it, I'm doing the video pod.
[03:05:29.293 --> 03:05:31.715]  In fact, I may rig my bedroom up with a camera.
[03:05:31.735 --> 03:05:35.759]  I'll be like on the pillow, my hair sticking up, I'll turn to the side and make points.
[03:05:37.941 --> 03:05:42.144]  What's the schedule tomorrow so that I know when I can mark off to come in here and cover this stuff?
[03:05:42.484 --> 03:05:43.385]  You're gonna be happy.
[03:05:43.986 --> 03:05:45.027]  Because it's wide open.
[03:05:45.367 --> 03:05:45.667]  Right now.
[03:05:45.707 --> 03:05:46.888]  Good, I said keep some days open.
[03:05:46.908 --> 03:05:49.831]  So I can keep tomorrow wide open and we'll just book for Thursday and Friday.
[03:05:51.154 --> 03:05:52.295]  I've seen that guy on TV for years.
[03:06:12.188 --> 03:06:13.309]  You see him there and that's it.
[03:06:13.909 --> 03:06:15.751]  So tomorrow, Alex... And I was talking to him.
[03:06:15.791 --> 03:06:18.092]  He listens to the show, must be all the time.
[03:06:18.112 --> 03:06:20.614]  Yeah, he was talking about the John Perkins interview.
[03:06:20.734 --> 03:06:21.415]  So you listen to that.
[03:06:22.648 --> 03:06:24.950]  No, he was saying he listens a lot when he's on the podcast.
[03:06:26.252 --> 03:06:30.255]  I guess when you got that much money, you can afford to get your information at any time.
[03:06:30.816 --> 03:06:33.799]  Yeah, but I'm really flattered that how many people, it's kind of spooky though.
[03:06:34.339 --> 03:06:36.361]  I mean, I haven't even really covered this.
[03:06:36.762 --> 03:06:39.745]  We're attacked by the LA Times, which is the Ferris piece.
[03:06:40.005 --> 03:06:40.625]  The Bloomberg.
[03:06:40.685 --> 03:06:47.112]  Bloomberg, New York Times, Variety, Washington Post, and literally probably 10 other things I didn't even print.
[03:06:47.532 --> 03:06:49.115]  I mean, and it's all BS.
[03:06:49.175 --> 03:06:49.696]  It's all no fun.
[03:06:49.796 --> 03:06:55.044]  It says, it says, I imagined that they pulled a fire drill on me, that I imagined men following me.
[03:06:55.084 --> 03:06:55.825]  It's all on record.
[03:06:55.865 --> 03:06:56.286]  They did it.
[03:06:56.446 --> 03:06:56.686]  Right.
[03:06:57.287 --> 03:06:59.531]  I mean, they walk up to me and say, you better not pull fire alarms.
[03:06:59.831 --> 03:07:02.015]  We've got people pulling them and trying to steal vases in here.
[03:07:03.036 --> 03:07:05.717]  And then they walk off and I go to my room and they pull the fire alarm on me.
[03:07:05.997 --> 03:07:07.698]  And then I'm weird for freaking out.
[03:07:07.858 --> 03:07:10.539]  And then we have them following us off the grounds.
[03:07:10.799 --> 03:07:10.979]  Yeah.
[03:07:11.039 --> 03:07:13.099]  In secret service with earpieces on video.
[03:07:13.299 --> 03:07:14.920]  And they're saying it doesn't exist!
[03:07:15.520 --> 03:07:17.221]  Rob, I mean, that's, they're so...
[03:07:18.101 --> 03:07:19.362]  Or maybe they're not discredited.
[03:07:19.422 --> 03:07:23.304]  Maybe the public's so dumb, it wants to feel like they're elitist, making fun of me.
[03:07:23.604 --> 03:07:24.425]  See how that mindset?
[03:07:24.445 --> 03:07:26.526]  Oh, look at this poor schizophrenic.
[03:07:26.847 --> 03:07:28.067]  He believes in an elite.
[03:07:28.147 --> 03:07:29.088]  Just go with the system.
[03:07:29.448 --> 03:07:30.109]  It'll be okay.
[03:07:30.549 --> 03:07:31.149]  It'll be okay.
[03:07:31.229 --> 03:07:33.391]  Yeah, but I mean, these are really pathetic.
[03:07:34.691 --> 03:07:35.352]  I agree.
[03:07:35.652 --> 03:07:36.432]  I totally agree.
[03:07:36.492 --> 03:07:37.913]  I mean... You know, I feel sad for Danny.
[03:07:38.294 --> 03:07:41.035]  I think he was a little upset that he got cut out of the New World Order film.
[03:07:41.516 --> 03:07:42.276]  But I agree with him.
[03:07:42.376 --> 03:07:45.418]  It is somewhat of a distortion and kind of a hit piece, so he ought to be happy.
[03:07:45.738 --> 03:07:46.419]  He says he is happy.
[03:07:46.439 --> 03:07:46.879]  He's not in it.
[03:07:47.463 --> 03:07:50.606]  And, you know, I think he could have lended more credibility to it, you know?
[03:07:50.686 --> 03:07:53.428]  I thought... Well, he is a gentle fellow, but I don't think he got it.
[03:07:53.468 --> 03:07:56.371]  That's what... People were asking why his feathers got out of, you know, ruffle there.
[03:07:56.691 --> 03:07:58.252]  I don't control what some film crew does.
[03:07:58.593 --> 03:07:58.793]  Right.
[03:07:58.873 --> 03:08:01.595]  I didn't even really remember that they'd mentioned they'd interviewed Estlin years ago.
[03:08:02.176 --> 03:08:03.477]  Film crews come, they go.
[03:08:04.097 --> 03:08:05.018]  We've had a lot of them in here.
[03:08:05.038 --> 03:08:06.119]  They're always hit pieces.
[03:08:06.139 --> 03:08:06.499]  Yeah.
[03:08:06.699 --> 03:08:08.221]  This one was one of the lesser hit pieces.
[03:08:09.127 --> 03:08:12.811]  Well, we haven't seen the conspiracy hunters from Australia.
[03:08:12.831 --> 03:08:13.872]  We haven't seen their piece yet.
[03:08:14.113 --> 03:08:15.254]  I don't think that's a hit piece.
[03:08:15.354 --> 03:08:16.996]  They sent me books their family had written.
[03:08:17.016 --> 03:08:18.077]  It's all anti-New World Order.
[03:08:18.497 --> 03:08:19.378]  Those guys were for real.
[03:08:19.498 --> 03:08:21.841]  No, I think that's going to be a good one when it comes out.
[03:08:23.666 --> 03:08:25.446]  Alex Jones, hump day special, tomorrow.
[03:08:25.987 --> 03:08:30.048]  But the same thing is, they may not even let it come out.
[03:08:30.348 --> 03:08:35.529]  I mean, it's like the maker of Paradise Lost and some kind of monster, and Brothers Keeper.
[03:08:35.549 --> 03:08:39.910]  You know, that guy's won, you know, Oscars and stuff.
[03:08:40.290 --> 03:08:47.352]  And you notice that three million plus dollars to make a film with yours truly as the main guy, gone.
[03:08:47.512 --> 03:08:48.292]  Not going to be aired.
[03:08:49.072 --> 03:08:50.053]  Oh, I bet we could find it.
[03:08:50.833 --> 03:08:51.913]  I bet we could find it somehow.
[03:08:52.245 --> 03:08:53.125]  Oh no, no, no.
[03:08:53.145 --> 03:08:53.805]  That was shelved.
[03:08:54.466 --> 03:08:57.006]  That was shelved at Discovery.
[03:08:59.927 --> 03:09:01.708]  He told me not to talk about it like a year and a half ago.
[03:09:01.728 --> 03:09:02.728]  He said, just wait and see.
[03:09:03.628 --> 03:09:04.488]  Later you can talk about it.
[03:09:04.528 --> 03:09:05.388]  So now I talk about it.
[03:09:06.009 --> 03:09:07.169]  I ought to get him back on the show.
[03:09:07.629 --> 03:09:07.969]  Who's that?
[03:09:08.189 --> 03:09:08.609]  What's his name?
[03:09:08.869 --> 03:09:09.890]  Joe Belanger.
[03:09:09.990 --> 03:09:10.390]  Belger.
[03:09:10.410 --> 03:09:11.550]  I always mispronounce it.
[03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:14.711]  He's the co-director on all the films I mentioned.
[03:09:18.206 --> 03:09:20.227]  Let's call him up and get him back on the show.
[03:09:21.007 --> 03:09:21.987]  Don't tell him it's about that.
[03:09:22.027 --> 03:09:24.688]  If he wants to bring that up on air, we'll just have him bring that up.
[03:09:25.008 --> 03:09:26.709]  That's how I'm also able to get all these guests.
[03:09:26.749 --> 03:09:29.070]  As people know, I'm not usually mean to people.
[03:09:29.410 --> 03:09:32.731]  Unless they come on and say we need to exterminate everybody and then I tend to start arguing with them.
[03:09:33.191 --> 03:09:36.472]  I'm like, oh, so Prince Philip's part of your royal eugenics society.
[03:09:36.852 --> 03:09:38.534]  That's it, this interview is over!
[03:09:54.867 --> 03:10:05.330]  The group that David Rockefeller calls the good group, with Oprah Winfrey and Ted Turner and Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett, all for eugenics.
[03:10:05.650 --> 03:10:10.111]  And Watson, when he saw the ABC News thing last week, said, oh, it was a eugenics meeting.
[03:10:10.311 --> 03:10:11.591]  Because we've seen these same people.
[03:10:11.911 --> 03:10:13.832]  And then it came out it was a eugenics meeting.
[03:10:14.192 --> 03:10:15.832]  I mean, we're right about everything here.
[03:10:15.852 --> 03:10:18.133]  It's just all these people talk about is how they're going to kill us.
[03:10:18.908 --> 03:10:21.450]  Billionaire Club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[03:10:22.190 --> 03:10:23.071]  And see, I got news for you.
[03:10:23.171 --> 03:10:27.874]  All you good old boys and stuff go, yeah, there are too many especially colored people.
[03:10:28.174 --> 03:10:28.734]  Get rid of them.
[03:10:29.374 --> 03:10:31.856]  They're putting sodium fluoride in your water too, Mac.
[03:10:31.896 --> 03:10:38.760]  They've selected a plastic for mass distribution that leaches hormones that sterilize you and give you cancer.
[03:10:39.181 --> 03:10:40.541]  They are hurting you too.
[03:10:41.022 --> 03:10:42.623]  That's the thing is this eugenics
[03:10:43.263 --> 03:10:44.623]  He's targeting everybody.
[03:10:44.904 --> 03:10:47.824]  And when you study the elites, they're all about not drinking out of plastic.
[03:10:48.145 --> 03:10:51.886]  They're all about, you know, doing all these detoxes.
[03:10:52.186 --> 03:10:55.047]  They're all about not eating GMO foods.
[03:10:55.327 --> 03:11:01.188]  They're all about not, I mean, most of the Hollywood people I know that are highest level have all been given the word.
[03:11:01.369 --> 03:11:08.331]  They have special water tank systems where spring water is trucked into tanks and they take showers in spring water.
[03:11:08.571 --> 03:11:10.031]  They wouldn't get into tap water.
[03:11:10.191 --> 03:11:12.312]  Folks, tap water will kill a fish.
[03:11:13.416 --> 03:11:16.920]  Yeah, we used to have to sit it out for days to let all the chemicals evaporate out of it.
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:25.049]  Have you ever noticed that if you're watering your lawn with water hoses, it makes it all peaking and almost die, but if it rains it all suddenly grows?
[03:11:25.069 --> 03:11:25.369]  Oh yeah.
[03:11:25.489 --> 03:11:27.952]  Because it's got hundreds of deadly chemicals in it!
[03:11:28.593 --> 03:11:29.133]  I mean, folks...
[03:11:30.214 --> 03:11:32.415]  And look, I know this, but I only drink purified water.
[03:11:32.655 --> 03:11:37.197]  And I've got those Berkey systems I got from them that only cut some of it out to go around it.
[03:11:37.297 --> 03:11:39.658]  I've got to look at getting a whole home water system in.
[03:11:39.978 --> 03:11:40.778]  Then it's the time.
[03:11:40.838 --> 03:11:41.879]  I keep procrastinating.
[03:11:41.899 --> 03:11:42.339]  I don't do it.
[03:11:42.559 --> 03:11:43.299]  Then it's the money.
[03:11:43.859 --> 03:11:45.900]  You know, my gosh, 20 grand for this or whatever.
[03:11:46.260 --> 03:11:46.840]  I don't have it.
[03:11:47.181 --> 03:11:48.721]  But my kids are in these bathtubs.
[03:11:48.741 --> 03:11:49.561]  They're in these showers.
[03:11:49.581 --> 03:11:50.402]  They're breathing it.
[03:11:50.702 --> 03:11:51.922]  The skin's the biggest organ.
[03:11:52.162 --> 03:11:53.563]  See, I said I'd take calls, and I'm not doing that.
[03:11:54.773 --> 03:11:55.293]  So I should go.
[03:11:55.754 --> 03:11:56.395]  I'm ranting.
[03:11:56.415 --> 03:11:58.296]  Well listen, Rob, you're doing a great job.
[03:11:58.356 --> 03:11:59.437]  How was your Memorial Day?
[03:11:59.718 --> 03:12:01.880]  It was an amazing time.
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:06.544]  Met a lot of cool people out camping and played some music.
[03:12:07.124 --> 03:12:08.005]  But I had a great time.
[03:12:08.085 --> 03:12:13.130]  So I appreciate the time off and I'm ready to get back in the swing of things.
[03:12:13.430 --> 03:12:16.113]  And we're going to be looking at B-Roll tonight, me and Rob Jacobson.
[03:12:16.733 --> 03:12:18.334]  Oh, listen, you gotta call John Perkins.
[03:12:18.354 --> 03:12:19.135]  He agreed to the interview.
[03:12:19.375 --> 03:12:20.036]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:12:20.056 --> 03:12:21.297]  We gotta get out there today.
[03:12:21.657 --> 03:12:23.139]  Today, I think, is the day to call that lady.
[03:12:23.179 --> 03:12:23.499]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:12:23.539 --> 03:12:24.260]  We're gonna have it.
[03:12:24.300 --> 03:12:26.101]  Mid-June, late-June, and back on the radio, too.
[03:12:26.301 --> 03:12:26.461]  Yep.
[03:12:26.802 --> 03:12:27.602]  Warp 1 engaged.
[03:12:27.723 --> 03:12:27.963]  Got it.
[03:12:28.823 --> 03:12:29.284]  Good job.
[03:12:29.524 --> 03:12:29.984]  There we go.
[03:12:31.386 --> 03:12:32.727]  You wanna go into overdrive today, man?
[03:12:33.287 --> 03:12:34.268]  Kinda feelin' overdrive-y.
[03:12:34.488 --> 03:12:36.690]  Look, I promise I'm gonna at least jam in these calls.
[03:12:36.730 --> 03:12:37.511]  Who do we got here?
[03:12:39.553 --> 03:12:42.135]  Jeff, Annie, Jason, Mark, Fred, Tom.
[03:12:44.042 --> 03:12:44.983]  That's a lot of calls there.
[03:12:45.003 --> 03:12:46.563]  The phone system only takes six up there.
[03:12:46.583 --> 03:12:47.904]  We can take hundreds on our phone system.
[03:12:47.944 --> 03:12:49.705]  We may have to transfer them over by going to overdrive.
[03:12:50.846 --> 03:12:53.287]  I do want to tell you about who made this show possible.
[03:12:53.607 --> 03:13:01.952]  I start ranting and babbling happily, because we are beating the hell out of the New World Order here, thanks to God, that I never even get to the sponsors that make this show possible.
[03:13:01.972 --> 03:13:04.593]  Let me tell you about a couple of those when we go to your phone calls here today.
[03:13:07.261 --> 03:13:09.442]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[03:13:09.482 --> 03:13:13.184]  Our biggest sponsor, Refoods Direct, is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the country.
[03:13:13.464 --> 03:13:16.706]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the Freedom Movement for years and years.
[03:13:17.246 --> 03:13:29.172]  With the looming economic collapse, food shortages, inflation happening, you need to get this high-quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid, super good food at super low prices.
[03:13:29.212 --> 03:13:30.733]  You'd be surprised how inexpensive it is.
[03:13:31.053 --> 03:13:32.714]  More than ten years of its climate control.
[03:13:32.794 --> 03:13:35.816]  Ten years guaranteed if you stick it in the garage like I do.
[03:13:36.576 --> 03:13:40.418]  My garage is full of everything, including about three years' supply of food.
[03:13:41.098 --> 03:13:43.840]  Give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:13:43.860 --> 03:13:44.880]  They got month's supplies.
[03:13:44.920 --> 03:13:45.961]  They got three-day supplies.
[03:13:46.261 --> 03:13:47.861]  Get a sampler pack.
[03:13:47.881 --> 03:13:51.423]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[03:13:51.643 --> 03:13:53.424]  The letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[03:13:53.444 --> 03:13:54.885]  The J. Michael Stevens Group.
[03:13:54.925 --> 03:13:56.786]  Just fabulous, fabulous folks.
[03:13:57.822 --> 03:14:00.984]  On the same line of preparedness, mysolarbackup.com.
[03:14:01.004 --> 03:14:04.706]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[03:14:05.606 --> 03:14:09.108]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[03:14:09.509 --> 03:14:14.011]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[03:14:14.471 --> 03:14:18.614]  It's designed to provide 800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[03:14:19.534 --> 03:14:30.100]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source, each is 100, power plant, high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity, that's right, generates free electricity.
[03:14:30.140 --> 03:14:36.904]  Remember too, the gas generators need gas, but in a blackout gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[03:14:37.245 --> 03:14:40.206]  The solar generators like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[03:14:40.226 --> 03:14:42.227]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[03:14:42.247 --> 03:14:42.988]  The government doesn't own the
[03:14:43.288 --> 03:14:43.969]  Sun yet, folks.
[03:14:44.310 --> 03:14:45.492]  So make your move today.
[03:14:45.713 --> 03:14:48.237]  Their website is mysolarbackup.com.
[03:14:48.538 --> 03:14:49.780]  Mysolarbackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:14:49.800 --> 03:14:49.980]  That's 877-327-03.
[03:14:56.902 --> 03:14:58.644]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:14:59.345 --> 03:15:00.386]  And another sponsor.
[03:15:00.426 --> 03:15:04.590]  See, I wait the whole show to plug these and get them here at the end, but that's when we got the most listeners, so good for the sponsors.
[03:15:05.171 --> 03:15:08.294]  I really do believe in all these sponsors, but this one is particularly great.
[03:15:08.635 --> 03:15:09.816]  Pepperspray.com.
[03:15:09.896 --> 03:15:12.899]  The lowest prices I've seen anywhere I have bought from them.
[03:15:13.180 --> 03:15:15.662]  That's how I found them, and I said, go get them as a sponsor.
[03:15:16.463 --> 03:15:17.883]  And I said, my listeners aren't stupid.
[03:15:17.903 --> 03:15:20.404]  They know most areas have different restrictions on the Second Amendment.
[03:15:20.624 --> 03:15:23.545]  But they yell on tasers, stun guns, and high-quality pepper spray and mace.
[03:15:24.105 --> 03:15:25.345]  I said, I want you as a sponsor.
[03:15:25.385 --> 03:15:28.066]  And we got them as a sponsor.
[03:15:28.086 --> 03:15:29.846]  1-800-908-9988.
[03:15:29.866 --> 03:15:30.886]  1-800-908-9988.
[03:15:32.466 --> 03:15:34.507]  Free shipping on orders over $99.
[03:15:35.907 --> 03:15:41.268]  You cannot beat the deals on tasers, stun guns, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms.
[03:15:41.348 --> 03:15:42.309]  Buy it for your daughters.
[03:15:42.729 --> 03:15:43.589]  Buy it for your husbands.
[03:15:43.629 --> 03:15:43.969]  Whatever.
[03:15:46.272 --> 03:15:52.773]  Great thing to give your daughter or son who's on campus where it's illegal to own guns, but most campuses allow tasers.
[03:15:52.793 --> 03:16:00.534]  1-800-908-9988, 1-800-908-9988, or Pepperspray.com.
[03:16:01.175 --> 03:16:05.775]  Okay, that is our sponsors for the day that have made this transmission possible.
[03:16:05.795 --> 03:16:07.756]  We're very, very thankful to them.
[03:16:08.076 --> 03:16:09.696]  Let's go to Jeff in Tennessee.
[03:16:10.056 --> 03:16:11.156]  Jeff, you are on the air.
[03:16:11.196 --> 03:16:11.536]  Welcome.
[03:16:12.877 --> 03:16:13.457]  Hello, Alex.
[03:16:14.077 --> 03:16:14.777]  Hello, my friend.
[03:16:16.255 --> 03:16:17.616]  I tried to get in last week.
[03:16:17.696 --> 03:16:20.638]  I'll get off the subject and I'll go to Mr. Trudeau there.
[03:16:21.519 --> 03:16:25.783]  That Miley Cyrus girl, I guess maybe I'm not pronouncing it right.
[03:16:25.803 --> 03:16:28.185]  Hannah Montana saying we should all have our free speech taken.
[03:16:28.746 --> 03:16:36.152]  Yeah, isn't there some information that her daddy has got some type of governmental background or something?
[03:16:37.253 --> 03:16:40.657]  I have read that, but I don't have to admit I don't know much about Hannah Montana.
[03:16:41.177 --> 03:16:42.018]  I just know that
[03:16:43.658 --> 03:16:48.420]  Any of the employees, the little girls who were here maybe one hour a month, they're dancing around to Hannah Montana.
[03:16:48.720 --> 03:16:58.384]  So this is total brainwashing, saying in Reuters, ban free speech, it's for the children, pass the Cyber Bullying Act, where it's a federal felony if you criticize anybody.
[03:16:58.704 --> 03:17:02.686]  I mean, it actually says, this makes the hate crimes bill look like nothing.
[03:17:04.907 --> 03:17:10.469]  I thought I'd read something about Achy Breaky Heart guy that his family or something had some
[03:17:11.167 --> 03:17:13.168]  Yeah, Kevin Trudeau, I picked up his book
[03:17:40.143 --> 03:17:47.031]  My wife is an RN, and I had high blood pressure for years, and we picked up his book.
[03:17:47.051 --> 03:17:53.139]  She saw something about a gland that he mentioned in the book, and I was riding a bike, dieting, and you name it.
[03:17:53.567 --> 03:17:57.208]  Within 15 days of not using MSG or hypochlorite.
[03:17:57.248 --> 03:17:57.708]  Stay there!
[03:17:57.768 --> 03:17:58.129]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:17:58.149 --> 03:18:00.369]  They want to shut him down because he's the real deal.
[03:18:00.909 --> 03:18:02.190]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:18:02.230 --> 03:18:07.572]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:18:07.812 --> 03:18:12.433]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:18:12.834 --> 03:18:13.214]  It's true.
[03:18:13.314 --> 03:18:15.875]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[03:18:16.115 --> 03:18:17.895]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:18:18.415 --> 03:18:23.097]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:18:23.629 --> 03:18:30.553]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:18:30.734 --> 03:18:31.634]  And here's the best part.
[03:18:31.854 --> 03:18:38.238]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:18:38.539 --> 03:18:41.380]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:18:41.741 --> 03:18:43.622]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:18:43.962 --> 03:18:44.883]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:18:44.903 --> 03:18:45.083]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:18:45.103 --> 03:18:45.323]  Remember,
[03:18:53.683 --> 03:18:57.269]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:18:57.589 --> 03:19:00.034]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:19:01.536 --> 03:19:06.765]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:19:07.552 --> 03:19:12.896]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:19:13.436 --> 03:19:19.640]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:19:19.960 --> 03:19:21.741]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:19:21.901 --> 03:19:24.283]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:19:24.363 --> 03:19:35.250]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:19:37.538 --> 03:19:38.799]  It's not about left or right.
[03:19:39.220 --> 03:19:40.601]  It's about a one world government.
[03:19:41.061 --> 03:19:47.407]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:19:56.255 --> 03:19:57.396]  The Obama Deception.
[03:19:57.817 --> 03:19:58.998]  The people strike back.
[03:20:00.848 --> 03:20:03.171]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[03:20:03.331 --> 03:20:07.035]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[03:20:07.135 --> 03:20:09.778]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[03:20:09.939 --> 03:20:17.147]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[03:20:17.267 --> 03:20:17.987]  We're good to go.
[03:20:33.715 --> 03:20:37.739]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[03:20:37.879 --> 03:20:42.863]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:20:43.684 --> 03:20:48.608]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[03:20:48.728 --> 03:20:52.472]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:20:53.192 --> 03:20:55.714]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[03:20:55.834 --> 03:20:56.275]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:21:25.891 --> 03:21:29.152]  Taken, fired, I said I'll never give it up!
[03:21:31.754 --> 03:21:35.035]  Gotta cheesily sing for Hoosier there, he loves it, he begs me to sing to him.
[03:21:35.315 --> 03:21:36.896]  I sing to him during the breaks.
[03:21:37.656 --> 03:21:40.658]  That's a form of payment, that's salary.
[03:21:40.738 --> 03:21:41.438]  I sing to him.
[03:21:41.458 --> 03:21:45.840]  Rapunzel, Rapunzel, lower down your hair.
[03:21:48.130 --> 03:21:49.791]  If you think I sit around.
[03:21:49.811 --> 03:21:52.774]  Alright Jeff, finish up the point you were making.
[03:21:52.814 --> 03:21:59.739]  So, so you read one of Kevin Drudeau's books, you had a hormonal problem, because every time you put the fluoride water in the rest of it, that attacks all your glands.
[03:22:00.079 --> 03:22:01.320]  Tell us what happened when you did that.
[03:22:02.121 --> 03:22:10.907]  Well, as I was saying, my wife, she's an RN, and there was a mention of hypoglamorous gland or something, which I didn't understand, but she immediately ordered the book.
[03:22:11.507 --> 03:22:16.151]  After four or five years of riding bike, exercising, dieting, water, pills, you name it,
[03:22:16.847 --> 03:22:19.908]  Fifteen days, I went into the physician's office.
[03:22:19.948 --> 03:22:25.569]  They took my blood pressure nine times, had the biggest shock in their life, and said, hey, stop the medication.
[03:22:25.609 --> 03:22:26.429]  What's going on?
[03:22:27.129 --> 03:22:29.529]  And that's why they want to shut Trudeau down.
[03:22:29.829 --> 03:22:32.270]  I mean, I've read his natural cures.
[03:22:32.350 --> 03:22:33.130]  I don't want you to know.
[03:22:33.470 --> 03:22:37.111]  It's all just the mainline things that have been proven to really be good.
[03:22:37.911 --> 03:22:44.172]  I would say I owe my life to him because I was really, really blowing the spigot on this blood pressure problem.
[03:22:44.634 --> 03:22:51.516]  And I didn't go into the steroid treatment, I went into just quitting MSG and high fructose corn syrup.
[03:22:52.011 --> 03:22:57.675]  Going to the foreign cheeses and this type of stuff and not buying this manufactured googly gob.
[03:22:57.955 --> 03:22:58.536]  Exactly.
[03:22:58.596 --> 03:22:59.436]  Listen, same here.
[03:22:59.556 --> 03:23:01.718]  I eat nothing processed.
[03:23:01.798 --> 03:23:05.841]  I eat as much as I was eating months ago and I've lost 20 plus pounds.
[03:23:06.161 --> 03:23:08.203]  I'm losing a pound every three or four days now.
[03:23:08.263 --> 03:23:09.744]  It's really getting fast.
[03:23:10.284 --> 03:23:12.406]  And no more fat, so here.
[03:23:12.426 --> 03:23:13.787]  Hey, good to hear from you, man.
[03:23:14.247 --> 03:23:15.168]  Good to hear from you.
[03:23:15.348 --> 03:23:15.808]  You know what?
[03:23:15.848 --> 03:23:17.109]  These are all such great callers.
[03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:19.411]  Let's talk to Annie in Indiana.
[03:23:19.511 --> 03:23:20.291]  Annie, you're on the air.
[03:23:20.331 --> 03:23:20.712]  Go ahead.
[03:23:21.940 --> 03:23:22.500]  Hi, Alex.
[03:23:22.600 --> 03:23:23.320]  This is Annie.
[03:23:23.520 --> 03:23:24.020]  Can you hear me?
[03:23:24.040 --> 03:23:24.200]  Hi, Annie.
[03:23:24.480 --> 03:23:25.021]  Yes, I can.
[03:23:25.041 --> 03:23:25.661]  Hi.
[03:23:25.701 --> 03:23:29.101]  I'm going to talk quick because I know you're running out of time and I've been holding a long time.
[03:23:29.961 --> 03:23:31.622]  I was hoping to talk directly to Kevin.
[03:23:32.242 --> 03:23:33.222]  We're going to have him back up.
[03:23:33.242 --> 03:23:34.202]  He wants to come on all the time.
[03:23:34.242 --> 03:23:34.522]  Go ahead.
[03:23:34.942 --> 03:23:35.762]  Great.
[03:23:36.002 --> 03:23:37.883]  I'm a Texan and exiled in Indiana.
[03:23:38.183 --> 03:23:45.264]  I went to a National Vietnam Vets Convention about 15 years ago in Kokomo and I bought a bumper sticker and it said, don't steal.
[03:23:45.284 --> 03:23:47.244]  The government doesn't like the competition.
[03:23:47.524 --> 03:23:48.665]  I love that bumper sticker.
[03:23:48.685 --> 03:23:50.245]  In fact, I'm going to make a t-shirt of that.
[03:23:50.285 --> 03:23:50.685]  That's it.
[03:23:50.705 --> 03:23:51.265]  Go ahead.
[03:23:52.108 --> 03:23:54.848]  He doesn't like the competition and they'll get even with you if you compete.
[03:23:55.289 --> 03:23:58.709]  But something, I used to wonder if Kevin was for real, if he was just in it for the bucks.
[03:23:58.849 --> 03:24:03.350]  A few months ago I caught him on maybe one of the last infomercials he did on his new financial book.
[03:24:03.850 --> 03:24:12.251]  He said that an acquaintance, not a friend, but an acquaintance said to him that under the new Obama administration, we have a license to steal.
[03:24:12.311 --> 03:24:13.272]  And Kevin goes, so?
[03:24:13.372 --> 03:24:14.712]  And the guy says, you don't get it.
[03:24:15.252 --> 03:24:16.532]  We have a license to steal.
[03:24:16.552 --> 03:24:18.412]  And Kevin goes, well, how does that affect me?
[03:24:18.452 --> 03:24:19.193]  I'm not a thief.
[03:24:20.553 --> 03:24:21.813]  A license to steal.
[03:24:22.412 --> 03:24:27.274]  Is that not the, um... You know, I'm not exactly getting your point.
[03:24:27.594 --> 03:24:37.617]  I mean, explain... Apparently, under the Obama administration, the higher-ups have a license to steal and they are looting and stealing us right under our nose.
[03:24:37.637 --> 03:24:38.877]  No, no, that's true, yeah.
[03:24:39.358 --> 03:24:40.338]  Come home tired.
[03:24:40.778 --> 03:24:41.858]  We don't do anything about it.
[03:24:41.898 --> 03:24:44.539]  We pay our taxes and we moo like contented cows.
[03:24:44.679 --> 03:24:45.940]  Moo, moo, bye-bye.
[03:24:45.980 --> 03:24:48.200]  I love the sheep bleeding on your commercial, Obama.
[03:24:48.581 --> 03:24:49.621]  Bye, bye!
[03:24:50.313 --> 03:24:58.675]  And I have to identify with that because I'm one of the tired 60 year old plus people going to work, paying my taxes, going along to get along, knowing what I know.
[03:24:58.695 --> 03:25:03.536]  Um, but I know... No, no, ma'am, it's absolutely sickening and we're trying to change that.
[03:25:04.156 --> 03:25:04.876]  I'm out of time.
[03:25:06.257 --> 03:25:09.197]  Uh, guys, what's the number to call to go into overdrive here?
[03:25:09.217 --> 03:25:11.398]  I need to give that to the people that are holding it, Genesis.
[03:25:11.678 --> 03:25:13.258]  Someone take their calls and the show's over.
[03:25:13.278 --> 03:25:14.559]  We're going into overdrive.
[03:25:15.179 --> 03:25:15.919]  You guys ready for this?
[03:25:17.419 --> 03:25:18.220]  Because I need to give the... 888...
[03:25:21.499 --> 03:25:25.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:25:25.420 --> 03:25:27.121]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:25:50.677 --> 03:25:52.265]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:25:52.365 --> 03:25:53.672]  I've told you for a long time.
