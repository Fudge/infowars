[00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:39.094]  Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:43.777]  I'm going to get more into the news on eugenics and Pelosi saying, don't have children, it's bad for the economy.
[00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:46.414]  Yes, dying cultures are good, I guess.
[00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:48.395]  Dino, in Canada.
[00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.536]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:50.737]  Thank you.
[00:00:50.977 --> 00:00:51.517]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:52.418]  You bet.
[00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:52.958]  Thank you.
[00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.862]  I just wanted to talk about, like, basically the media.
[00:00:59.502 --> 00:01:06.967]  How, in Canada, we watch, I mean, there's more American news on our news than there is Canadian news.
[00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:13.671]  And, I mean, when you watch the news, American news,
[00:01:14.548 --> 00:01:17.971]  All they seem to play is games of he said, she said.
[00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:23.015]  And you watch our news, and it's so damn boring that you just want to change the channel.
[00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:24.937]  No, that's it.
[00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:30.762]  You've got more the British model of just the droning, brainwashing, and basic statistics that are all false or twisted.
[00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:42.072]  And then here it's all left-right paradigm, playing groups off against each other so we never look above at the elite above the little managers they've got down here that uses their front dummies or their shields.
[00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:46.816]  I mean, I talked to my friends and I said, look, it's pretty bad when people know more about Paris Hilton's vagina
[00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:07.327]  than actual events.
[00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:08.868]  You know, it's kind of sad.
[00:02:09.168 --> 00:02:10.409]  Yeah, it's all part of the distraction.
[00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.630]  I appreciate your call, Dino.
[00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:14.112]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:14.472]  Welcome.
[00:02:15.673 --> 00:02:16.453]  Hello, Alex.
[00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:17.154]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:18.515]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:19.195 --> 00:02:23.979]  Alex, I wanted to talk about regarding Obama and Bush.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:35.307]  I'm a gunsmith here in Texas, and it's regarding the Second Amendment, that how they're trying to make gunsmiths get a manufacturer's license.
[00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:37.013]  I'm going to hold you over.
[00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:37.873]  This is important.
[00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:38.513]  I saw that in the news.
[00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:43.897]  Through regulation, that puts you under the control of a guild, and then you're just a citizen.
[00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:09.151]  buys a gunsmithing book and learns how to clean their gun or fix it, that's going to be illegal, quote, modifying it.
[00:03:10.172 --> 00:03:13.294]  And so, again, this is a way to further kill the gun culture.
[00:03:13.314 --> 00:03:13.955]  Explain it to people.
[00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:15.316]  Yes, sir.
[00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:26.844]  In the article, which I can send you off-air, but in the article they're stating where, quote-unquote from the article, November 2008,
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.222]  Yes sir, and there are even ATF and FBI recruiting, trying to recruit some of the gunsmiths at this career fair.
[00:03:53.582 --> 00:04:04.725]  It says, quote-unquote, do you suppose possible ATF is being purposely vague about defining gunsmithing versus manufacturing due to some form of top-to-bottom pressure applied by the revenuers?
[00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:11.347]  Could be, since manufacturers must collect and pay excise taxes on their sold merchandise.
[00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:16.088]  Going down, the man was asking a question.
[00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.671]  I'm still waiting.
[00:04:18.351 --> 00:04:19.592]  This is a reporter.
[00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:24.635]  I am still waiting for a black chopper to land on my lawn because I raised that question.
[00:04:24.895 --> 00:04:30.658]  Even though the ATF agent didn't have very good answers to my questions, I found a pretty good answer.
[00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.820]  April-May issue of Shop Business.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:42.966]  Going down, it says, if you, the gunsmith, perform work on a firearm that has been requested by a customer, you are not manufacturing.
[00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:49.264]  If you build and work on guns with the sole objective being to sell them later, you're manufacturing.
[00:04:49.944 --> 00:04:57.048]  And what I see in this, Alex, and I want to hear your comments, is that it's going to affect the guys that reload ammunition.
[00:04:57.528 --> 00:04:58.608]  More than that, stop there.
[00:04:58.628 --> 00:04:59.249]  I'm going to hold you over.
[00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:00.069]  This is so important.
[00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.091]  Because I've been reading about this, and I haven't seen the article you're talking about in the industry publication.
[00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:07.353]  Email it to Aaron with two A's at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.733]  We'll post a link to it right now.
[00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:12.115]  He's in there updating with Curt Nemo, so we can get that done.
[00:05:13.934 --> 00:05:27.207]  Every industry, so with the animal ID, the premises ID, this new greenhouse gas emission, they're going to selectively make people go through regulations, controls, to shut them down, to tax them, to trace them, and it's going to be just like private sales.
[00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:30.931]  If you work on a gun, and then the guy goes and sells it,
[00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:36.873]  They're going to claim you did that for sales, and they're going to come raid you, claiming you were illegally selling guns.
[00:05:36.893 --> 00:05:44.355]  What they really want to do is kill the grassroots retooling and selling of private firearms, and that's their big move.
[00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:49.637]  So let's come back and talk about that when we get back to the attack on the Second Amendment that is very real.
[00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:54.399]  We're on the march.
[00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.480]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.101]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:04.588 --> 00:06:05.809]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:07.250]  eFoods does it again.

[00:06:12.594 --> 00:06:20.741]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.

[00:06:43.965 --> 00:06:46.145]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:50.586]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[00:06:50.946 --> 00:06:53.647]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:56.007]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:03.664 --> 00:07:09.148]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:10.689]  And we knew what to do.
[00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:12.491]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:19.155]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:28.262]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:35.451]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:38.791]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:44.113]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:07:44.693 --> 00:07:47.313]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:08:55.972 --> 00:08:56.473]  That's 1-800-934-2563 today.
[00:08:56.493 --> 00:08:57.153]  Strange days are here.
[00:09:30.106 --> 00:09:44.051]  Yes, so a new age of big government regulation.
[00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:49.773]  They didn't triple the size of the federal government and triple the size of the BATF and build the biggest federal building
[00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:55.223]  or any agency in the United States in D.C.
[00:09:55.483 --> 00:09:59.784]  a few years ago, took four years to build it, the new B.A.T.F.
[00:10:00.765 --> 00:10:01.485]  Command Center.
[00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:05.647]  The new B.A.T.F.E.
[00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:09.748]  They tried to change their name like Monsanto and everybody else does when they get exposed.
[00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:16.171]  Very, very serious and they're coming after the gunsmiths now.
[00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:25.723]  And the NRA was set up by the federal government as a mode of gun control after the Civil War.
[00:10:26.463 --> 00:10:29.044]  And if you go study history, we've had Larry Pratt, Gunners of America, on about this.
[00:10:29.084 --> 00:10:31.425]  They supported the Gun Control Act in 33, 34.
[00:10:31.985 --> 00:10:35.387]  They supported the 68 Gun Control Act.
[00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:42.930]  They had Charlton Heston, who I've interviewed, God rest his soul, got up on TV and said, we're having these riots, we've got to restrict the guns, we've got to keep them out of felons' hands.
[00:10:44.155 --> 00:10:45.736]  Yeah, Alex, the only point I wanted to make was that
[00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:30.343]  In this article, American Gunsmith Association, November 2008, and I'll finish up with this, the basic idea was to create common ground upon which students, graduates of resident schools, as well as participating gunsmiths who were seeking employment could network with businesses and other organizations, including some law enforcement agencies.
[00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:33.084]  Now that's the co-opting of the gunsmiths.
[00:11:33.988 --> 00:11:35.250]  Yes sir.
[00:11:35.651 --> 00:11:37.173]  And that's really about all I have to say.
[00:11:37.193 --> 00:11:40.698]  I want to hear you comment, Alex, on your blessing and voice in the wilderness, sir.
[00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:41.980]  Well we're trying!
[00:11:43.581 --> 00:11:44.462]  I appreciate your call.
[00:11:44.482 --> 00:11:45.823]  Well, you've heard my comments on it.
[00:11:47.243 --> 00:11:51.466]  I mean, under the new green taxes, they've got 80 plus in New York State.
[00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:53.508]  I mean, they're just every facet of life.
[00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:59.792]  While they squeeze the economy, while they shut down Main Street, they have to extract the tens of trillions of dollars they've already stolen.
[00:12:00.332 --> 00:12:04.035]  When you write your income tax check, it doesn't go to the IRS or the Federal Treasury.
[00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:05.636]  It goes to the Federal Reserve.
[00:12:07.877 --> 00:12:09.138]  But the Federal Reserve isn't federal.
[00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:09.839]  It's private.
[00:12:10.697 --> 00:12:13.537]  Let's go ahead and talk to Derek in Detroit.
[00:12:13.597 --> 00:12:15.178]  Derek, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:16.818]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:12:17.138 --> 00:12:17.398]  Good.
[00:12:18.558 --> 00:12:21.059]  I'm calling about the Obama family.
[00:12:21.099 --> 00:12:24.419]  I live in Detroit, and there's a huge black population here.
[00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:28.520]  And, you know, I've been talking to a lot of people.
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.040]  Actually, my fiancée, she's black.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.741]  I've been talking to her family about it.
[00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:40.122]  And as you were saying, you know, like the race issue overshadows everything.
[00:12:40.908 --> 00:13:02.881]  We had our city council actually endorsed him, but through all the Kwame madness we had here, it seems like our local media has totally forgotten the fact that one-third of our council members are being investigated by the FBI for taking payments from Senegral.
[00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:09.805]  And it's like, if you want to know what somebody is about, you have to follow the money trail.
[00:13:11.016 --> 00:13:12.096]  That's just obvious.
[00:13:12.797 --> 00:13:23.400]  And, I mean, to have these people, who are so corrupt in our city government, backing someone such as Obama to the point where it's, you know, almost deifying.
[00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:29.463]  And, I mean, it's no wonder, you know, everybody just seems to be blindsided.
[00:13:29.523 --> 00:13:35.044]  What's happening is, and it's shameful that you have to call it and say, my fiancé's black, I'm not racist.
[00:13:35.545 --> 00:13:37.565]  But, I mean, that's how this whole thing's been dumbed down.
[00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:38.406]  That's exactly what
[00:13:39.787 --> 00:13:53.362]  KRS-One said here on the air is that it's all about the new order, putting on a black face, the novelty of that, distracting everybody from the point that he's a puppet anyways, presidents don't run anything, A. B, his agenda is a new world order.
[00:13:54.523 --> 00:14:02.228]  And then see when all this thing implodes and falls in on itself, it's going to be blamed on the black president and that's going to destroy race relations even that much more.
[00:14:02.288 --> 00:14:16.098]  So we have to look down the line of where all of this is going and all these big cities, Detroit, Houston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, I mean it's all totally corrupt, whether it's black leaders, white leaders.
[00:14:16.678 --> 00:14:17.699]  That's what the elite wants.
[00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:19.341]  These people go up the chain of command.
[00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:20.502]  They get the lobbyist's money.
[00:14:20.542 --> 00:14:23.484]  They get the media attention because they did take payoffs.
[00:14:23.504 --> 00:14:24.525]  Because they were corrupt.
[00:14:25.266 --> 00:14:26.667]  And they'll work with the globalists.
[00:14:27.128 --> 00:14:31.372]  I mean, we had the big toll road companies come in here and spend hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:14:32.032 --> 00:14:43.016]  In lobbying to literally just have the entire interstate and Texas highway system, 8,000 miles of it, plus hand it over to them and it's come out as total corruption, payoffs, all this.
[00:14:43.456 --> 00:14:44.216]  What do the companies do?
[00:14:44.236 --> 00:14:47.177]  They just buy up the newspapers to stop that reporting when it happens.
[00:14:47.857 --> 00:14:56.143]  Uh, to seize the roads and put toll roads on them, where they make a couple hundred million dollar investment over the decade, and they get hundreds of billions of dollars in tolls in the next decade.
[00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:59.765]  I mean, they're talking about hundreds of billions just in Texas alone, if they're able to do this.
[00:14:59.845 --> 00:15:02.127]  Hundreds of millions, you know, per toll road, per year.
[00:15:02.147 --> 00:15:03.928]  I mean, this is just massive.
[00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:09.472]  And so, yes, you have this big city Chicago machine creature, Barack Obama,
[00:15:11.082 --> 00:15:16.884]  Who is surrounded by criminals and cutthroats and thugs and Blagojevich who Rahm Emanuel handled.
[00:15:16.924 --> 00:15:21.766]  He brought those two up together as his protégés.
[00:15:22.326 --> 00:15:28.929]  But then you have Cheney and Halliburton being offshore and tens of billions of dollars in no-bid contracts and all that corporate corruption.
[00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:34.851]  It is just the New World Order is private offshore banks and companies combining forces offshore
[00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:46.258]  Robbing all the nations of the world, and then buying off those nations' politicians to sign treaties with the World Trade Organization and other private groups that then have more authority over the governments, over what they do.
[00:15:46.518 --> 00:15:48.119]  Then the nations are totally bankrupt.
[00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:52.542]  They have to sign IMF World Bank Agreements to follow whatever these private banks say.
[00:15:52.902 --> 00:15:59.926]  And now they're even skipping that and saying, we're going to create a World Bank that sets the currency, sets the interest rates, regulates private industry,
[00:16:00.246 --> 00:16:05.710]  Regulates local businesses, where this private banking group that engineered all this openly runs everything.
[00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.171]  It is so incredible!
[00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:08.912]  It's happening now!
[00:16:09.773 --> 00:16:13.755]  Everything we said, it's in Newsweek and Time and everywhere saying, world government.
[00:16:14.175 --> 00:16:15.376]  World government is here.
[00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:17.518]  The bankers will save you with world government.
[00:16:17.558 --> 00:16:18.879]  And it's just more of the same.
[00:16:19.739 --> 00:16:21.781]  So, absolutely, that's who they want.
[00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:23.762]  They want crooks they can work with.
[00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:30.283]  I don't know if you actually know what Senegro is about.
[00:16:30.944 --> 00:16:32.085]  They're a waste management.
[00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:40.872]  What they want to do is they want to convert our waste management, that is CityRan, you know, it employs Michiganders, you know.
[00:16:41.213 --> 00:16:42.394]  This is a seizure, sir.
[00:16:42.614 --> 00:16:45.016]  Sir, all the corruption is about seizure of architecture.
[00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:47.358]  Make your point and then I'll elaborate.
[00:16:47.818 --> 00:16:51.922]  Oh, well, the whole plan is they want to take human fecal
[00:16:52.515 --> 00:16:57.538]  Pelletize it, and then sell it as fertilizer for crops here in our state.
[00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:01.280]  And I mean, I don't know.
[00:17:01.321 --> 00:17:02.261]  That's always the cover.
[00:17:02.701 --> 00:17:16.970]  They want the water treatment, they want the waste management, they want the infrastructure of the city, and then they'll say, oh it's for wind power, oh it's for fertilizer, when that's only one small part but gives it a green sound, to sell the public on that has been brainwashed.
[00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.851]  Let me comment on that.
[00:17:18.993 --> 00:17:20.353]  You brought this up and what did I say?
[00:17:20.654 --> 00:17:35.839]  I said they want corrupt politicians in who will hand over the roads, before you even got into the waste management, who will hand over the city and state paid for gas lines, the power plants, the coal powered plants, the hydroelectric plants, the nuke plants.
[00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:41.205]  Taxpayers pay for it, private groups manage it, still make the profit, that isn't enough.
[00:17:41.385 --> 00:18:04.895]  In the IMF World Bank plan, I've been screaming about since 2002, they said in the West, in England, in Iceland, like we did in Argentina, they said in the US, in Canada, in Australia, in Europe, we are going to bankrupt the economy and then the people have to come to the private banks, the governments have to come to the private banks to go into receivership and the IMF and World Bank says, we'll give you these loans, we'll prop your currency up.
[00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:15.439]  But to do that, to be bailed out with your own money, you have to do this hundred plus list, and that's hand over all of your infrastructure.
[00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:17.741]  And so that's why most of the U.S.
[00:18:17.781 --> 00:18:21.604]  water districts and things are now owned by foreign offshore companies, because that's the group.
[00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:24.726]  And so they'll come in to a paid-for water district,
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:33.171]  And the Feds will even write regulations saying, doesn't matter if you've got a brand new water treatment, you've got to upgrade it with this, you know, $400 million package for some mid-sized city.
[00:18:33.191 --> 00:18:36.516]  I mean, I've seen, it was in the front page of the paper the other day here in Austin, all the corruption involved.
[00:18:37.057 --> 00:18:38.459]  It even comes out that it's all corrupt.
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.962]  And so they forced them to quote,
[00:18:41.448 --> 00:18:44.930]  Be insolvent, because they can't pay for it, the city can't pay for it with the mandate.
[00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:54.176]  And they say, don't worry, we have this European banking subsidiary that owns a water district company, a waste management, a water...
[00:18:55.999 --> 00:19:11.127]  Management company, they'll come in and you just basically sell your water district, your pipes, everything to them, the wastewater cleaning facilities to us for nothing and we'll pay for the upgrade.
[00:19:11.467 --> 00:19:12.888]  Then they usually don't even do the upgrade.
[00:19:13.668 --> 00:19:14.508]  So see how that works?
[00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:16.770]  Oh yeah.
[00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.131]  And they are just taking everything over.
[00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:19.591]  Anything else?
[00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:23.393]  No, nothing but you're doing a great job, man.
[00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.314]  I enjoy listening to you every day.
[00:19:26.072 --> 00:19:27.453]  You know, keep up the good work, man.
[00:19:27.473 --> 00:19:28.833]  I appreciate you.
[00:19:28.873 --> 00:19:34.455]  If everybody had the guts like you got to get out and say what's really going on, maybe we wouldn't be in this situation.
[00:19:34.855 --> 00:19:35.876]  But you have a great one, Alex.
[00:19:35.896 --> 00:19:36.756]  Thanks for the time, man.
[00:19:36.956 --> 00:19:37.416]  Thank you.
[00:19:37.877 --> 00:19:43.899]  I'm just somebody who 13 years ago got in a fight, well really 15 years ago, going around in politics and things, but 13 years ago on air.
[00:19:47.677 --> 00:19:52.401]  So now we're in a position to have a lot of people listening, but we need to grow exponentially to get the word out to others.
[00:19:53.141 --> 00:19:56.904]  I mean, I could go into this even more, but the roads, the land.
[00:19:57.384 --> 00:20:00.827]  I mean, here's another example of seizing infrastructure all over the country.
[00:20:01.447 --> 00:20:08.733]  Whether it's New London, Connecticut, or whether it's Hoboken, New Jersey, or whether it's Austin, Texas.
[00:20:09.893 --> 00:20:12.836]  They will go on the news and they will say, a salamander is dying.
[00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:13.636]  It's very rare.
[00:20:13.696 --> 00:20:15.337]  It's in this pool in the middle of the city.
[00:20:16.368 --> 00:20:18.883]  The water is running off of construction and will kill it.
[00:20:20.523 --> 00:20:21.443]  This is the case of Austin.
[00:20:21.503 --> 00:20:31.228]  So they say, all right, we're going to have a 15,000 acre land grab and a 5,000 acre land grab and a 1,000 acre land grab and, you know, 20 or 30 other little, you know, 100 acre land grabs here and there.
[00:20:31.248 --> 00:20:32.329]  There's all these different pieces of land.
[00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:36.771]  And they say, we're going to have a city bond proposal to buy this land.
[00:20:36.811 --> 00:20:46.016]  But then they make the people that own the land sell it, saying, well, because of the snail darter or the golden-cheeked warbler bird or the cave bug or the salamander, you can't build.
[00:20:46.696 --> 00:20:48.958]  And so their property value goes down, they're just sitting there on it.
[00:20:49.238 --> 00:20:52.920]  And they say, doesn't matter, you can sell to us for 5-10 cents on the dollar.
[00:20:54.742 --> 00:21:06.750]  Then the city councils with the Nature Conservancy, which is now the biggest landowner in the U.S., they come in and two or three years later it's the same, and everybody's forgotten that, oh, that 15,000 acres was supposed to be a giant park.
[00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:13.414]  And they'll take 200 acres, 300 acres of it, I go to these parks, of hill country, off the road, and that will be a park.
[00:21:14.895 --> 00:21:15.556]  That will be a park.
[00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:22.546]  But then they build big roads in and build houses and condos and golf courses and resorts here in Austin.
[00:21:23.567 --> 00:21:25.269]  And huge hotel day spas.
[00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.431]  And they just take the restrictions off.
[00:21:29.152 --> 00:21:31.114]  They say, you know what, we're going to go ahead and build on this.
[00:21:31.134 --> 00:21:31.895]  We said we weren't.
[00:21:32.195 --> 00:21:38.440]  See, so they basically steal the land, pay for it with our money, and then openly, former mayors open banks.
[00:21:39.485 --> 00:21:44.796]  Herc Watson just opens a bank and says, I have the bank and I have the deals inside government.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:48.703]  He's now a state senator to where only I am allowed to decide who can build on this.
[00:21:50.626 --> 00:21:53.747]  And then literally, I mean, it's just, that's one example.
[00:21:54.127 --> 00:21:55.468]  It's everywhere.
[00:21:56.368 --> 00:21:57.308]  It's everywhere.
[00:21:58.369 --> 00:21:59.729]  In New London, Connecticut.
[00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:07.912]  Thousands and thousands of homes in a upper-middle class to lower-middle class area, depending on which area they're along the waterfront.
[00:22:08.312 --> 00:22:12.073]  We're talking three-story Victorian homes that were valued at a million bucks, $600,000.
[00:22:12.173 --> 00:22:14.294]  I interviewed the families, it was in the news.
[00:22:15.074 --> 00:22:19.916]  And they tell them a decade ago, we're going to force you to sell your houses, and by the way, we're not, see, the New London
[00:22:21.857 --> 00:22:25.258]  Connecticut Supreme Court ruling of three, four years ago.
[00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:27.298]  Was it New London?
[00:22:27.658 --> 00:22:30.659]  I forget the name of even the case.
[00:22:30.719 --> 00:22:31.519]  New London Kelo.
[00:22:31.679 --> 00:22:33.059]  New London Kelo decision.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.140]  And they just say, guess what?
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.441]  We're not going to pay you market value for your house.
[00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:50.823]  See, before, they could come steal your land through adverse possession and through eminent domain and say, we've got to pay you market value.
[00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:54.505]  And then you could generally get what it was on the tax rolls.
[00:22:54.565 --> 00:22:55.025]  No, no, no, no.
[00:22:55.085 --> 00:23:01.309]  The new ruling, and the media simplified it to, people don't like, you know, having their houses taken for roads.
[00:23:01.349 --> 00:23:01.909]  That wasn't it.
[00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.232]  A big pharma company, the city, a few other companies wanted to build headquarters there.
[00:23:06.912 --> 00:23:07.793]  So they set the precedent.
[00:23:07.813 --> 00:23:10.755]  They said, we are going to take your thousand plus homes.
[00:23:11.994 --> 00:23:15.218]  And by the time the decision, most of them had given up and only a few hundred homes were still there.
[00:23:15.518 --> 00:23:19.683]  Places where grandma lived upstairs and the kids, you know, the family had been there for hundreds of years.
[00:23:20.124 --> 00:23:20.764]  Family homes.
[00:23:21.345 --> 00:23:21.966]  Famous homes.
[00:23:22.907 --> 00:23:23.588]  Historical homes.
[00:23:25.527 --> 00:23:42.757]  And they said, in the decision, not only can government, if it wants to build a road or something, take your land, you don't have to be paid fair market value, and private interests can legally lobby to have your land taken, and it's even legal for bribery to happen.
[00:23:42.938 --> 00:23:43.378]  It says it.
[00:23:43.658 --> 00:23:44.499]  They don't call it bribery.
[00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:51.343]  They say they can lobby and give campaign donations openly to politicians to take your land locally,
[00:23:52.475 --> 00:24:01.697]  And that once they take your land locally, they don't even have to pay you for it, except what it would be for the piece of land itself under a condemnation.
[00:24:02.097 --> 00:24:06.798]  Then the families that fought were told, years before the decision three years ago, was it four years ago?
[00:24:06.838 --> 00:24:07.538]  Now time flies.
[00:24:08.218 --> 00:24:11.779]  If you fight us, we will give you court fees.
[00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:19.261]  And so not only were their houses taken without being paid, they were then given the court fees for fighting it, and the Supreme Court said that was okay.
[00:24:19.801 --> 00:24:27.799]  So this is going back like a thousand years ago to ancient Europe or something, or the Byzantines, where they would just say, we just are taking your land because the emperor says so.
[00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:32.196]  Now, that's what was different.
[00:24:32.716 --> 00:24:35.078]  It wasn't just imminent domain issue.
[00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:41.602]  It was, we can just take your property, and all the major landowners in Texas have gotten these notices.
[00:24:42.002 --> 00:24:49.727]  My dad owns a good sized piece of family property, and he got notices a few years ago, the Texas Landowner and Homeowner's Bill of Rights.
[00:24:50.768 --> 00:24:55.051]  Sounds like you're getting, it's like Patriot Act, takes your rights away, and is unpatriotic, but it's called Patriot Act.
[00:24:55.791 --> 00:24:59.634]  And in the forms, my dad showed me, it said, you're put on notice.
[00:25:01.218 --> 00:25:18.882]  As a landowning taxpayer, that if you refuse a pipeline, or you refuse drilling, or you refuse a bridge, or you refuse anything the government wants to do with your property, you have six weeks to comply and take the first offer, or you forfeit the offer, and you get nothing.
[00:25:21.482 --> 00:25:33.335]  It's an offer you can't refuse, like Don Carleone having Luca Brasi put the gun to the band leader's head and say, hey, either your signature is on that contract or your brains are going to be on that contract.
[00:25:33.896 --> 00:25:34.556]  It's the same thing.
[00:25:34.737 --> 00:25:36.819]  Hey, you got six weeks.
[00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:41.284]  You take the offers or it's refused and we takes it.
[00:25:43.157 --> 00:25:52.464]  Now, I'm telling you, that's rogue government, because you've got these international bankers who have created more fiat currency than all the wealth in all the world.
[00:25:52.904 --> 00:25:55.026]  They've created thousands of trillions.
[00:25:55.066 --> 00:25:57.587]  It's all fiat, it's all bull, it isn't real.
[00:25:57.688 --> 00:26:03.232]  But, it has value to your local governments, they will take it, they will send police, they will do whatever it takes to get that money.
[00:26:04.793 --> 00:26:07.655]  And because people won't give up their real assets for the fiat money.
[00:26:09.366 --> 00:26:21.305]  The globalists need to force take over the economy and force take over the nouveau riche and old wealth that isn't part of the elite and so it's saying we're coming in forcibly taking your land and if we don't want to we won't even pay you.
[00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:25.442]  This is, property rights is the foundation of any free society.
[00:26:25.462 --> 00:26:26.342]  It is the most basic.
[00:26:26.402 --> 00:26:27.383]  Slaves can't own property.
[00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:30.866]  And you know, they watered that down with a property tax.
[00:26:30.886 --> 00:26:34.289]  You know, you pay a daily rent on your land, it isn't really your land.
[00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:37.291]  People put up with that crap in the last hundred years.
[00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:41.154]  Now, it's, oh, we're putting environmental restrictions on.
[00:26:41.334 --> 00:26:42.835]  Oh, we're going to force you to sell.
[00:26:43.056 --> 00:26:45.598]  Oh, we're going to, again, this is only part of it.
[00:26:46.917 --> 00:26:51.840]  Alright, we're coming back and we're going to Lance, Jim, Cullen, and others.
[00:26:52.641 --> 00:26:58.664]  And then I'm going to get into Nancy Pelosi saying don't have children, the economy, and a lot more.
[00:26:58.724 --> 00:26:59.145]  Stay with us.

[00:29:03.644 --> 00:29:10.026]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:29:10.406 --> 00:29:12.086]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:29:13.041 --> 00:29:14.082]  But who is the enemy?
[00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:15.103]  Bin Laden.
[00:29:15.383 --> 00:29:16.364]  This is his M.O.
[00:29:16.384 --> 00:29:17.686]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:29:17.726 --> 00:29:19.407]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:29:19.748 --> 00:29:26.494]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:29:26.895 --> 00:29:27.335]  Some U.S.
[00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:33.020]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:29:33.721 --> 00:29:37.222]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:29:37.523 --> 00:29:40.024]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:30:06.032 --> 00:30:28.764]  You have six weeks to accept our offer that's under market for your land or your house or private interest with governmental power.
[00:30:29.765 --> 00:30:30.345]  We'll take it.
[00:30:31.426 --> 00:30:32.126]  Take it or leave it.
[00:30:33.575 --> 00:30:38.319]  It's not eminent domain, it's not to build a new highway, it's because bankers want it.
[00:30:38.779 --> 00:30:53.870]  They have unlimited fiat made-up money that you back up with your tax dollars and you pay your taxes, all your income taxes, to go to the offshore Federal Reserve so they can point that money right back at you as a weapon of consolidation and control.
[00:30:54.151 --> 00:31:02.297]  And then they teach you under the new eugenics system of humans are bad, bad for the earth, to accept having a lower standard of living, and that's Obama's new change.
[00:31:03.746 --> 00:31:05.127]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[00:31:06.228 --> 00:31:09.651]  Let's talk to... Who did I just talk to last, John?
[00:31:13.694 --> 00:31:15.016]  Lance in California.
[00:31:15.036 --> 00:31:15.736]  You're on the air.
[00:31:16.897 --> 00:31:17.418]  Hi, Alex.
[00:31:17.558 --> 00:31:18.218]  Can you hear me?
[00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:19.199]  Loud and clear.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.520]  Okay, great.
[00:31:21.441 --> 00:31:22.562]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:31:23.383 --> 00:31:26.926]  Look, I'm not, for one, that thinks there's a demon behind every bush.
[00:31:27.972 --> 00:31:39.817]  I'm objective, but I saw something I haven't really heard a lot of comments on in regards to the inauguration or coronation or whatever of Barack Hussein Obama last week.
[00:31:41.157 --> 00:31:42.778]  First of all, I'm a single parent.
[00:31:43.138 --> 00:31:44.719]  I've been that way for nine years.
[00:31:44.759 --> 00:31:45.659]  I've got four kids.
[00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:47.700]  Two of them have recently moved out.
[00:31:51.653 --> 00:31:56.677]  This inauguration, I have a child that is in high school and another one in grade school.
[00:31:56.697 --> 00:31:59.439]  So they had him watch the inauguration and brainwash them?
[00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:00.920]  Exactly.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:21.034]  And just not only that, Alex, I found out that it happened to a lot of people and I wanted you to comment on how wide was this done because it appeared to me, from what I found out, it was massively pre-planned and my son even had a nice little packet on how wonderful Joe Biden and Barack is.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.580]  It just really bothered me.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:29.062]  That was a real red flag for me as a parent because I've never seen that done with any of my other children.
[00:32:29.162 --> 00:32:31.883]  I've never gone to see something like that.
[00:32:31.903 --> 00:32:33.183]  It's never been done in America.
[00:32:33.203 --> 00:32:34.923]  It was only done with Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[00:32:35.323 --> 00:32:37.204]  It is the opposite of a free society, sir.
[00:32:37.624 --> 00:32:42.045]  They are running with government money and production what's got to be a billion dollar program.
[00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:44.886]  It's on every TV, every radio, newsprint.
[00:32:45.896 --> 00:32:54.446]  Join usaservice.org, which is separate from government, is a group under Barack Obama, but being advertised as join the government.
[00:32:55.087 --> 00:33:06.000]  Every major school district in the nation, through federal curriculum, and schools are saying they're adopting the Obama curriculum, and that is literally the worship of Barack Obama
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.821]  And that he will save you, and packets of info.
[00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:09.661]  It was all over the news.
[00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:12.562]  In fact, I saw that last week.
[00:33:12.602 --> 00:33:13.682]  Never even got to it on air.
[00:33:13.702 --> 00:33:15.763]  Well, actually, I did mention it, and show the article.
[00:33:16.603 --> 00:33:23.305]  One of many, where it said that they're all forced to watch it, and then hear how great it is, and hear how this is our new dear leader.
[00:33:24.526 --> 00:33:28.207]  And again, governments, presidents never had their own private army.
[00:33:28.547 --> 00:33:33.008]  They've never had billboards as if, you know, announcing him.
[00:33:33.028 --> 00:33:34.929]  I mean, they have that in North Korea.
[00:33:35.609 --> 00:33:38.331]  And so, but America's never lived under real hardcore tyranny.
[00:33:38.351 --> 00:33:40.071]  They lived under corruption and some bad presidents.
[00:33:40.572 --> 00:33:45.554]  But see, we're going into receivership now, so they need this messianic leader to get everybody in line.
[00:33:46.355 --> 00:33:48.596]  And I haven't seen the packets.
[00:33:48.636 --> 00:33:52.818]  I read that they were given information about the historic president and the feds printed it up.
[00:33:54.059 --> 00:33:55.740]  Notice how he changed the look of the website.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.902]  Whitehouse.gov to match USA Service and his other private sites.
[00:34:00.922 --> 00:34:03.924]  They're all unifying it in a unified front.
[00:34:04.644 --> 00:34:08.646]  And they're going to now make the children federally serve us.
[00:34:08.906 --> 00:34:12.067]  And this was on Change.gov until the news reported and they pulled it off.
[00:34:12.087 --> 00:34:14.448]  But it's in Emanuel's book and Obama's spoken about it.
[00:34:14.468 --> 00:34:16.169]  And Obama people email me saying it isn't true.
[00:34:16.189 --> 00:34:17.550]  And we have all the screenshots.
[00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:27.533]  Saying your children will be basically taken from you for hours every week to go serve under whatever Obama says they must serve in, or they're going to be expelled.
[00:34:27.573 --> 00:34:32.134]  It's like there's no law you've got to take vaccines, but if you don't they kick you out, then they trigger a law for truancy.
[00:34:32.394 --> 00:34:35.115]  Well now they're going to kick you out if you don't serve or not give you your diploma.
[00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:36.116]  So this is slavery.
[00:34:36.136 --> 00:34:36.696]  Do you understand?
[00:34:36.716 --> 00:34:39.897]  I will not be silent because... Stay there, stay there.
[00:34:39.937 --> 00:34:40.557]  Back in 70 seconds.
[00:34:40.637 --> 00:34:41.877]  I want you to mail me that back.
[00:34:42.318 --> 00:34:42.678]  Stay with us.
[00:34:42.698 --> 00:34:46.239]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:34:53.097 --> 00:34:54.678]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:34:54.798 --> 00:34:59.420]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.261]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:35:02.501 --> 00:35:05.362]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:35:05.542 --> 00:35:10.264]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:35:10.484 --> 00:35:11.425]  If you simply prepare.
[00:35:11.605 --> 00:35:14.567]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:35:14.847 --> 00:35:21.753]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:24.975]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:35:39.866 --> 00:35:40.987]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:35:41.007 --> 00:35:41.688]  Take action today.
[00:35:41.708 --> 00:35:42.929]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:35:55.959 --> 00:35:57.863]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:35:58.344 --> 00:36:01.169]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:15.862 --> 00:36:17.203]  Lansing, California.
[00:36:17.783 --> 00:36:20.165]  The PO Box is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:36:20.185 --> 00:36:21.066]  Please mail us that.
[00:36:21.086 --> 00:36:23.107]  You can block out your son's name if you'd like.
[00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:26.089]  Tell folks about the packets that they were given.
[00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:30.132]  And again, you can just Google, Schools Adopt Obama Curriculum.
[00:36:30.172 --> 00:36:31.913]  You can read about it nationwide.
[00:36:32.814 --> 00:36:34.635]  Again, showing the federal control.
[00:36:34.655 --> 00:36:36.477]  That's what the federal standardization is about.
[00:36:36.517 --> 00:36:37.697]  It's all been federal for a long time.
[00:36:38.098 --> 00:36:39.379]  But see, they call it the Patriot Act.
[00:36:39.439 --> 00:36:40.259]  It's unpatriotic.
[00:36:40.519 --> 00:36:42.221]  They call it the Landowners Bill of Rights.
[00:36:42.881 --> 00:36:44.523]  But it's not a bill of rights.
[00:36:44.543 --> 00:36:46.044]  It takes your rights, fraudulently.
[00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:53.671]  They call all these things one thing, but it's the opposite.
[00:36:53.691 --> 00:36:55.833]  They call the school districts independent school districts.
[00:36:56.294 --> 00:36:56.954]  They're not independent.
[00:36:56.974 --> 00:36:57.815]  They're federally controlled.
[00:37:01.799 --> 00:37:04.421]  Let's go ahead and go back to Lansing, California.
[00:37:04.642 --> 00:37:05.963]  Do you have that packet in front of you?
[00:37:07.046 --> 00:37:14.413]  You know, I think my son had to turn it in the following day, actually, but I do remember some of the statements it just made.
[00:37:14.493 --> 00:37:15.574]  Well, that's even worse.
[00:37:15.634 --> 00:37:16.414]  That's even worse.
[00:37:16.995 --> 00:37:31.668]  In England, now in the U.S., they have them fill out dossiers in most public schools in the 6th or 7th grade with a deputized BATF local sheriff, deputy, or police officer paid by the feds to be that they have them write dossiers on their home life, and that's never given to the parents.
[00:37:31.768 --> 00:37:33.449]  But, I'm sorry, I was interrupting.
[00:37:33.469 --> 00:37:33.730]  Go ahead.
[00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:35.488]  No, that's okay Alex.
[00:37:35.588 --> 00:37:39.098]  I was just saying, yeah, my son did have to return it so...
[00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:44.872]  Hopefully I will get it back, but I don't get a lot of work that he does back from the teacher.
[00:37:45.192 --> 00:37:51.175]  Well, now the Army is recruiting the young people under federal law.
[00:37:51.215 --> 00:37:54.516]  The recruiters have offices in many of the schools and they're there pushing the kids.
[00:37:54.536 --> 00:38:00.518]  They were caught in Denver, they were caught in Houston, they were caught in Detroit, they were caught in New York.
[00:38:00.858 --> 00:38:01.579]  It's been all over the news.
[00:38:01.619 --> 00:38:02.579]  I see it every few weeks.
[00:38:02.879 --> 00:38:04.440]  And then the parents record them.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:12.508]  Because they'll call their 16-year-old and say, if you don't sign an agreement that when you're 17 or 18 you go in the military, I'm going to have you arrested.
[00:38:12.548 --> 00:38:15.271]  It's the law you sign that agreement when there's no law.
[00:38:15.672 --> 00:38:16.693]  In fact, people don't believe me.
[00:38:16.713 --> 00:38:17.273]  Pull that up.
[00:38:18.395 --> 00:38:20.797]  Google recruiter threatens teen with jail.
[00:38:21.858 --> 00:38:26.860]  And I think that was one of the headlines out of Houston, and you can hear him on the phone going, I'll have you arrested!
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.740]  You have to sign this agreement!
[00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:31.301]  Now again, it's like, I'll have you arrested!
[00:38:31.481 --> 00:38:33.002]  You gotta take these vaccines!
[00:38:33.382 --> 00:38:35.203]  It's a new criminal government!
[00:38:35.343 --> 00:38:37.083]  They're a bunch of lying scumbags!
[00:38:37.263 --> 00:38:38.484]  And everybody should be angry!
[00:38:38.884 --> 00:38:40.144]  They're taking your children from you!
[00:38:40.444 --> 00:38:43.385]  I've got what they give the children in Austin schools right here!
[00:38:43.405 --> 00:38:46.206]  I'm gonna get into this later with the Army, but go ahead.
[00:38:47.027 --> 00:38:50.648]  No, I was just gonna say, we should be getting angry, and
[00:38:51.309 --> 00:39:00.795]  And what's happening is I notice there's a lot of character assassination from the other side instead of just confronting and discussing the facts as they are.
[00:39:00.915 --> 00:39:11.863]  And I like to compare what's happening to the general American public in general to the, you've probably heard of the frog that is placed in a pot of water and you turn on the
[00:39:13.021 --> 00:39:21.409]  The heat real slow, you don't go fast, but that frog will not jump out, but it will boil to death as the heat is slowly turned up.
[00:39:22.282 --> 00:39:23.382]  Absolutely good to hear from you.
[00:39:23.662 --> 00:39:28.243]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, 2009, fill your life with endless possibilities.
[00:39:28.883 --> 00:39:34.864]  So in the public schools, they offer them $40,000 signing bonus to sign up for this.
[00:39:34.904 --> 00:39:37.865]  Now, an economy where they can't even get a job flipping hamburgers right now.
[00:39:38.245 --> 00:39:50.387]  I've seen reports where, in one case in Las Vegas, and there was another case I saw in Salt Lake City, where 1,000 people show up at a McDonald's for a $7 an hour job, as if you could live on that.
[00:39:50.427 --> 00:39:50.767]  Look at this.
[00:39:51.667 --> 00:39:53.969]  Fill your life with endless possibilities, Army.
[00:39:54.770 --> 00:40:00.236]  But see, even if they destroy the economy, if we had strong families, we could all live in houses together like the illegal aliens do and make it.
[00:40:00.676 --> 00:40:01.817]  But see, they're not going to allow that.
[00:40:01.837 --> 00:40:06.602]  They're going to destroy the economy and make you join the youth brigades, make you join the Army, make you join the military.
[00:40:06.622 --> 00:40:09.385]  I'm going to go through this and we take some calls when we get back.
[00:40:10.706 --> 00:40:13.008]  But, I mean, this is just absolutely sickening.
[00:40:13.868 --> 00:40:14.669]  What's going on?
[00:40:15.329 --> 00:40:19.872]  By the way, folks, they shoot you up with enough vaccines to kill an elephant once you join the military.
[00:40:19.912 --> 00:40:22.274]  Just that alone, and they use experimental vaccines on you.
[00:40:22.514 --> 00:40:23.915]  That's a violation of federal law.
[00:40:24.715 --> 00:40:33.101]  They're supposed to give you consent, but they have a little waiver in there if it's for, you know, research purposes or riot control.
[00:40:34.402 --> 00:40:38.084]  So we'll go over that as well when we get back after this quick break.
[00:40:38.124 --> 00:40:39.065]  Long segment coming up.
[00:40:39.405 --> 00:40:40.766]  We're going to get to Cullen.
[00:40:42.423 --> 00:40:47.145]  Jim, John, Patrick, and many others that are patiently holding 1-800-259-9231.

[00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.810]  I'm going to make that easier to find.
[00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:02.831]  It's kind of hard to find right now.
[00:41:03.471 --> 00:41:08.254]  Lead a superior life by drinking Superior Life brand ionized water.
[00:41:08.574 --> 00:41:12.536]  A couple of soft drinks each day, a few slices of pizza, last night's cheeseburgers.
[00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:18.720]  These acidic foods will make you tired, overweight and cause numerous negative health problems in the short and long term.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:25.364]  An acidic environment is created in the body causing fuzzy memory and that all day low energy feeling.
[00:41:25.624 --> 00:41:29.527]  These are the early signs of your body telling you that it's not getting the proper care it needs.
[00:41:29.807 --> 00:41:31.648]  We are truly a junk food nation.
[00:41:32.108 --> 00:41:40.634]  Drinking ionized water will help you drop the weight, feel better, actually become hydrated, and can improve the quality of your life.
[00:41:40.934 --> 00:41:42.415]  It's all about the pH.
[00:41:42.876 --> 00:41:45.037]  Disease cannot thrive in an alkaline body.
[00:41:45.337 --> 00:41:47.679]  What can a Life Brand Water Ionizer do for you?
[00:41:48.139 --> 00:41:48.419]  Call 800-276-9601.
[00:41:48.459 --> 00:41:48.639]  That's 800-276-9601.
[00:41:53.923 --> 00:41:58.665]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:41:58.865 --> 00:42:01.586]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:13.700]  But who is the enemy?
[00:42:14.221 --> 00:42:14.721]  Bin Laden.
[00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:16.002]  This is his M.O.
[00:42:16.022 --> 00:42:17.324]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:42:17.384 --> 00:42:19.026]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:42:19.386 --> 00:42:26.133]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:42:26.533 --> 00:42:26.974]  Some U.S.
[00:42:27.014 --> 00:42:32.660]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.842]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:42:36.862 --> 00:42:47.107]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:42:47.327 --> 00:42:48.088]  Fabled enemies.

[00:43:03.186 --> 00:43:06.489]  Aging doesn't only show in your face, but it can be felt in your body.
[00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:11.334]  You feel tired, your joints and muscles ache, and your mind seems clouded and forgetful.

[00:44:03.211 --> 00:44:08.256]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:08.617 --> 00:44:10.919]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:44:20.981 --> 00:44:26.007]  Alright, I want to blitz through your calls because I want to get into what the military recruiters are doing to our young people.
[00:44:26.047 --> 00:44:28.770]  I want to get into Pelosi and the one-child policy and the rest of it.
[00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:32.394]  Right now, let's go to Jim in West Virginia.
[00:44:32.434 --> 00:44:33.235]  You're on the air, Jim.
[00:44:33.255 --> 00:44:33.556]  Welcome.
[00:44:34.389 --> 00:44:35.970]  Yeah, here's more property seizure.
[00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:38.292]  Just about as bad, if not worse than anything else.
[00:44:38.333 --> 00:44:39.534]  You want to wake up your favorite yuppie?
[00:44:39.794 --> 00:44:42.316]  Do a program on the International Property Maintenance Code.
[00:44:42.336 --> 00:44:45.919]  It's actually the International Property Seizure Code.
[00:44:46.139 --> 00:44:55.267]  And that's why you think you've got local government, but internationally they set the code on how to steal property, how to take over, how to fine and feed people for three inch grass.
[00:44:55.307 --> 00:44:57.910]  That's all internationally written up through zoning.
[00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:58.230]  Go ahead.
[00:44:58.410 --> 00:44:59.571]  Yes, it's in black and white.
[00:44:59.611 --> 00:45:01.571]  It's the second biggest financial scam in U.S.
[00:45:01.611 --> 00:45:01.832]  history.
[00:45:01.852 --> 00:45:03.852]  It's about five times bigger than the bankrupt bailout.
[00:45:03.872 --> 00:45:05.193]  It's hidden in plain sight for years.
[00:45:05.693 --> 00:45:09.095]  International Property Maintenance Code.
[00:45:09.115 --> 00:45:10.575]  That's all under Agenda 21.
[00:45:10.615 --> 00:45:14.617]  The U.N., people say, doesn't have any power.
[00:45:15.057 --> 00:45:18.739]  What they do is they set global policy, like when Bush signed back onto UNESCO.
[00:45:19.059 --> 00:45:21.000]  That put our schools publicly under U.N.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:21.460]  curriculum.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:21.780]  Go ahead.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:22.941]  Download it.
[00:45:23.101 --> 00:45:23.381]  Read it.
[00:45:23.481 --> 00:45:24.501]  I can fast forward you on it.
[00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:25.762]  I can leave my phone number up there.
[00:45:26.164 --> 00:45:29.185]  And there's a deeper, this is collateralization, grabbing real estate.
[00:45:29.526 --> 00:45:32.127]  Imminent domain appails besides the IPMC.
[00:45:32.247 --> 00:45:40.671]  Well that's because when they bankrupt the nation, they forcibly take the land, so they've got to assess it and bring in the predatory rules, so under color of law they can do it.
[00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:41.831]  Tell folks briefly about it.
[00:45:42.452 --> 00:45:46.153]  Okay, real quick, like the code official is the sole interpreter of the code.
[00:45:46.674 --> 00:45:51.336]  Anything the code official says is, every day that a fraction occurs is a separate mandatory misdemeanor.
[00:45:51.869 --> 00:45:54.772]  Anything the code official says is not in good working order, BAM!
[00:45:55.032 --> 00:45:58.035]  It's $500,000 a day and or a month in jail for every day this occurs.
[00:45:58.155 --> 00:45:59.817]  Anything the code official says is not... Now let's stop there!
[00:46:00.217 --> 00:46:04.281]  They've passed these illegal criminal predatory rules, now they're slowly getting you ready for it.
[00:46:04.541 --> 00:46:10.226]  Where you hear about cities where they do home inspections every month to make sure the inside of the house you supposedly own is in order.
[00:46:10.507 --> 00:46:13.309]  Or three inch grass, $2,000 a day fines.
[00:46:13.329 --> 00:46:14.390]  They're now phasing...
[00:46:15.271 --> 00:46:17.172]  These end on everybody.
[00:46:17.652 --> 00:46:19.473]  And again, it's all done through maritime.
[00:46:19.513 --> 00:46:21.273]  It's all done through administrative law.
[00:46:21.654 --> 00:46:23.574]  It's done, and there's no recourse.
[00:46:24.295 --> 00:46:25.515]  It's just total fraud.
[00:46:25.775 --> 00:46:26.235]  Go ahead.
[00:46:26.836 --> 00:46:30.297]  It is not a law which is passed by a legislature, signed by a chief executive officer.
[00:46:30.417 --> 00:46:31.257]  It is a code.
[00:46:31.618 --> 00:46:35.799]  And this is the code that regional government will use to control people.
[00:46:35.819 --> 00:46:40.341]  That's why they set up these regional governments, where five, six counties are together, three, four states are together.
[00:46:40.721 --> 00:46:44.363]  In these FEMA regions, they then instruct the cities what to do.
[00:46:44.423 --> 00:46:44.643]  Go ahead.
[00:46:45.265 --> 00:46:47.968]  It is a code that is adopted by jurisdiction.
[00:46:48.288 --> 00:46:51.250]  And they can prevent you from entering your house.
[00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:54.273]  Also, anything the code official says is an unsanitary condition.
[00:46:54.293 --> 00:46:57.176]  Dog droppings, puddles, anything he says is a noxious weed.
[00:46:57.216 --> 00:46:58.237]  Define noxious weed.
[00:46:58.677 --> 00:47:00.619]  I did a show with Jerry Brownfield.
[00:47:00.659 --> 00:47:02.580]  Got more reaction than anything he's done in 20 or 30 years.
[00:47:02.641 --> 00:47:03.581]  About two and a half years ago.
[00:47:03.601 --> 00:47:04.342]  What's your name?
[00:47:04.362 --> 00:47:04.522]  Jim.
[00:47:09.454 --> 00:47:11.035]  Jim, I'm familiar with what you're talking about.
[00:47:11.075 --> 00:47:13.056]  It's All Agenda 21, but you sound articulate.
[00:47:13.076 --> 00:47:14.016]  Maybe you should be a guest.
[00:47:14.176 --> 00:47:17.357]  Email Aaron with two A's at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:17.717 --> 00:47:19.258]  Obviously, we have to have a guest with her full name.
[00:47:19.638 --> 00:47:21.159]  Send me links to the code you want to cover.
[00:47:21.199 --> 00:47:24.340]  I've seen it, but it sounds like you're really an expert on this particular area.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.420]  Perhaps we'll have you on as a guest.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.141]  I got hit with it, believe me.
[00:47:27.361 --> 00:47:28.801]  You're left with a house in the landfill.
[00:47:29.102 --> 00:47:32.683]  You're left with insane funds, the demolition costs, and the mortgage payment.
[00:47:33.729 --> 00:47:34.149]  I'll email.
[00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:35.830]  I'll leave you my phone number up here.
[00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:36.810]  But I mean, I was interrupting.
[00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:38.150]  Briefly explain what this is.
[00:47:40.231 --> 00:47:41.231]  Raw property seizure.
[00:47:41.812 --> 00:47:42.132]  Okay.
[00:47:42.432 --> 00:47:43.692]  The code official's sole interpreter.
[00:47:43.712 --> 00:47:44.472]  Forget judicial.
[00:47:44.753 --> 00:47:45.053]  Anything.
[00:47:45.433 --> 00:47:50.874]  Without action, court action, or notice, they can prevent you from entering your home, tear your house down, send you to demolition bill.
[00:47:52.075 --> 00:47:52.795]  Period.
[00:47:52.835 --> 00:47:54.076]  And that's what they did in New London.
[00:47:54.116 --> 00:47:55.796]  The people that wouldn't sell their houses for nothing.
[00:47:56.116 --> 00:47:57.537]  Well, it's statewide in six states.
[00:47:57.757 --> 00:47:58.617]  Texas is one of them.
[00:48:01.047 --> 00:48:05.548]  I had the Gore family on, who own Western Seafood since 1942.
[00:48:06.029 --> 00:48:09.190]  This is a company that's been making $15 million on average a year profit.
[00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.510]  Big company, wealthy family.
[00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:15.831]  The heir to mobile fortune wanted to build a thing for his yacht there, so they just took it.
[00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:17.132]  It was in the paper.
[00:48:17.152 --> 00:48:19.212]  It said, well, he wants it for a yacht, we're taking it.
[00:48:19.773 --> 00:48:20.913]  They're beta testing it right now.
[00:48:22.253 --> 00:48:24.434]  That was my point, is they're beta testing it.
[00:48:25.188 --> 00:48:25.748]  My God.
[00:48:26.088 --> 00:48:30.010]  And the cops are like, it's the law, we're coming to your house, if you don't leave we're going to machine gun you.
[00:48:31.671 --> 00:48:35.892]  How does the CPS take your children with no law or no due process or no sworn evidence?
[00:48:36.273 --> 00:48:38.414]  It's all these new fake courts.
[00:48:38.494 --> 00:48:39.154]  It's bull.
[00:48:40.734 --> 00:48:41.855]  This will wake up the yuppies.
[00:48:42.575 --> 00:48:43.175]  Every homeowner.
[00:48:43.796 --> 00:48:44.616]  Every real estate owner.
[00:48:45.336 --> 00:48:45.817]  Every renter.
[00:48:46.337 --> 00:48:46.677]  Everybody.
[00:48:47.563 --> 00:48:49.324]  International Property Maintenance Code.
[00:48:49.364 --> 00:48:49.764]  Four words.
[00:48:49.804 --> 00:48:50.125]  Google it.
[00:48:50.445 --> 00:48:52.646]  You can get the 2003 version PDF format.
[00:48:53.047 --> 00:48:53.487]  Download it.
[00:48:53.547 --> 00:48:53.827]  Read it.
[00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:56.309]  Jim, how did this happen to you?
[00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:58.690]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.932]  They came after me over six bags of grass clippings and a dented gutter.
[00:49:02.052 --> 00:49:03.273]  Our house is not a dump.
[00:49:03.333 --> 00:49:05.234]  There were 150 flowering species in our front yard.
[00:49:05.695 --> 00:49:08.817]  My wife uses the mulch, the grass clippings for mulch.
[00:49:09.177 --> 00:49:09.977]  Bags of grass clippings.
[00:49:10.177 --> 00:49:10.978]  I had a dented gutter.
[00:49:11.513 --> 00:49:16.297]  They were going to put me in jail two months and or $1,100 of fines over six bags of grass clippings and a den of gutter.
[00:49:17.037 --> 00:49:19.920]  Well, you've heard the reports about them swatting people for tall grass.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:25.964]  Well, at one time they were threatening to sighting me for a shovel handle visible above the porch railing.
[00:49:26.285 --> 00:49:35.091]  Now, I beat it only because I contacted 200 mainstream media outlets, local newspaper, internet known since we were in high school together.
[00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:35.832]  Nobody helped me.
[00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:37.133]  Finally, Barry Brownfield helped me.
[00:49:37.653 --> 00:49:39.075]  We did a show on July 14, 2006.
[00:49:41.292 --> 00:49:42.353]  Ed from Michigan calls in.
[00:49:42.373 --> 00:49:44.153]  They said, yeah, they got my... You want to hear a horror story?
[00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:44.914]  East St.
[00:49:44.934 --> 00:49:46.535]  Clair Shores, Michigan, I think.
[00:49:46.575 --> 00:49:47.815]  He said, they took my house down.
[00:49:47.855 --> 00:49:48.736]  My son was in cuffs.
[00:49:49.096 --> 00:49:50.897]  When I came home, they wouldn't let us in our house.
[00:49:50.917 --> 00:49:52.537]  They tore the house down, our possessions in it.
[00:49:53.278 --> 00:49:53.978]  And, uh, yeah.
[00:49:54.198 --> 00:49:55.399]  So it's a horror story.
[00:49:55.679 --> 00:49:57.260]  But it will wake up the yuppies.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.801]  But now, I got lucky, because I sat there after I got all this garbage going.
[00:50:00.841 --> 00:50:03.703]  I promised Derry that I'd give out names, addresses, phone numbers.
[00:50:04.323 --> 00:50:06.364]  Depending on how they handled it well, the city backed off.
[00:50:08.837 --> 00:50:09.858]  Yeah, it's totally criminal.
[00:50:10.318 --> 00:50:19.064]  I knew it was in Texas because, I remember back in 95, 96, I mean, somebody would have grass that tall, but the city wanted their land, and they always pick old people.
[00:50:19.164 --> 00:50:25.388]  After you've been in the hospital, it's in the health department, and they enter that you're sick, and they know you've got colon cancer or whatever, that's when they hit.
[00:50:26.108 --> 00:50:28.110]  And uh... they sort of give him two thousand dollars.
[00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.872]  I mean, think about how predatory that is.
[00:50:30.392 --> 00:50:31.113]  Is that they wait.
[00:50:31.133 --> 00:50:32.274]  Because I saw the cases.
[00:50:32.334 --> 00:50:33.535]  It's always an old person.
[00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:34.876]  At least it was in Austin.
[00:50:35.517 --> 00:50:37.398]  And then they put two thousand dollar a day fines.
[00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:40.521]  By the time the person fights it, a few weeks later, they take him to court.
[00:50:40.801 --> 00:50:41.822]  Then they take the land.
[00:50:41.862 --> 00:50:43.964]  The police come and throw him out on the street.
[00:50:44.345 --> 00:50:45.486]  Throw all their stuff out.
[00:50:45.506 --> 00:50:46.366]  The city takes it.
[00:50:46.427 --> 00:50:48.168]  And then bureaucrats move in.
[00:50:48.468 --> 00:50:50.050]  A lot of times they sell it.
[00:50:51.531 --> 00:50:56.053]  Did you see me a week ago when I covered how they're throwing old people out of their houses and then the bureaucrats move into them?
[00:50:56.534 --> 00:50:57.014]  I was listening.
[00:50:57.654 --> 00:50:59.175]  I mean, that's mainstream media.
[00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:01.216]  Criminals are in government.
[00:51:01.576 --> 00:51:03.357]  Criminals are running everything.
[00:51:04.197 --> 00:51:06.458]  Well, I tell you what, I've had the FBI out here.
[00:51:07.059 --> 00:51:13.262]  I have had a message from the governor within about a few hours of the time which I did the radio show and it doesn't air in West Virginia, only shortwave.
[00:51:14.883 --> 00:51:17.864]  I've had all kinds of interesting things happen to me ever since, but this is a hot target.
[00:51:18.228 --> 00:51:20.809]  But I'm not kidding you, it sounds so benign.
[00:51:20.869 --> 00:51:24.211]  International Property Maintenance Code, if you want to know what your government is all about.
[00:51:25.732 --> 00:51:35.597]  One of our founding fathers said, government is always about stealing property, taking people from property in foreign wars, and taking property from people domestically.
[00:51:35.617 --> 00:51:37.838]  Wow, I can't remember any Federalist Papers or something.
[00:51:38.098 --> 00:51:42.801]  But the bottom line is very simply, if you want to know what your government is all about, if you're still living in denial,
[00:51:43.408 --> 00:51:45.950]  Read the International Property Maintenance Council.
[00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:49.512]  Well, if you're in denial, read Section 802 of the Patriot Act.
[00:51:49.653 --> 00:51:55.877]  It says all misdemeanors are acts of terrorism, and then I hold the articles up where they're charging people for terrorism for marijuana.
[00:51:56.738 --> 00:51:57.238]  Absolutely.
[00:51:57.478 --> 00:52:00.320]  So the bottom line is if you're in denial, read it in a week.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.321]  Get a lawyer to read it.
[00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:01.901]  I don't care.
[00:52:01.921 --> 00:52:02.342]  It's very simple.
[00:52:02.362 --> 00:52:02.682]  I hear you.
[00:52:02.982 --> 00:52:06.384]  Sir, send me your name, your info, your background, some news articles about it.
[00:52:07.145 --> 00:52:09.327]  We always have to vet everybody, but I'm aware of what you're talking about.
[00:52:09.367 --> 00:52:09.987]  We'll have you on.
[00:52:10.027 --> 00:52:10.347]  Thank you.
[00:52:12.639 --> 00:52:16.302]  You see, that's why the Supreme Court ruled two weeks ago there's no more Fourth Amendment.
[00:52:16.902 --> 00:52:18.323]  They have to get in line with the Patriot Act.
[00:52:19.084 --> 00:52:22.106]  That's why they passed the Patriot Act, to get in line with Agenda 21.
[00:52:22.426 --> 00:52:25.769]  And one part of it is this international agreement on zoning.
[00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:28.911]  Sounds benign, it's what he was just talking about.
[00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:31.834]  The International Property Management System.
[00:52:32.594 --> 00:52:34.616]  And there's several that nexus together.
[00:52:34.876 --> 00:52:36.978]  There's several that people... and it's all UN-created.
[00:52:37.338 --> 00:52:38.699]  And it says you own nothing.
[00:52:38.719 --> 00:52:41.201]  It's what Stalin used to get people off their land.
[00:52:42.222 --> 00:52:44.103]  I want to go ahead and get into the Army right now.
[00:52:44.123 --> 00:52:47.424]  Now, they have brought in to all of the major public schools, Obama Day, Obama curriculum,
[00:53:03.641 --> 00:53:07.102]  Worshipping Obama, also having the military in the schools.
[00:53:07.182 --> 00:53:10.424]  So I wanted to play this video clip from CBS so we can analyze it.
[00:53:10.444 --> 00:53:11.424]  It's far worse than this.
[00:53:11.464 --> 00:53:12.625]  This is Katie Couric covering it.
[00:53:13.345 --> 00:53:18.407]  Where they then tell the children, it's the law, you've got to sign up with the military or I'll have you arrested.
[00:53:19.287 --> 00:53:23.789]  And then the guy that did this in one of the cases, he was promoted to one of the national directors.
[00:53:24.884 --> 00:53:26.465]  In one of these reports.
[00:53:26.525 --> 00:53:30.607]  So, a year after they're threatened to arrest people, it turns out that's the policy.
[00:53:30.967 --> 00:53:33.608]  It's all color of law and they promote the guys that get in trouble.
[00:53:33.809 --> 00:53:34.449]  So here it is.
[00:53:34.889 --> 00:53:40.392]  Houston reveals some recruiters have resorted to bullying tactics in order to keep their numbers up.
[00:53:40.992 --> 00:53:42.993]  David Martin at the Pentagon has the story.
[00:53:44.674 --> 00:53:50.357]  From NASCAR to bull riding, Army recruiters are pulling out all the stops to meet their quotas.
[00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:55.571]  But one recruiter was caught in a tape-recorded phone call doing it with threats.
[00:53:56.192 --> 00:53:56.753]  And guess what?
[00:53:56.813 --> 00:53:59.759]  Your AWOL passes without leave.
[00:54:00.282 --> 00:54:12.952]  According to the report by CBS affiliate KHOU in Houston, Irving Gonzalez signed a non-binding contract that left him free to change his mind about joining the Army up to the moment he reported for basic training.
[00:54:13.673 --> 00:54:14.893]  Which is exactly what he did.
[00:54:14.913 --> 00:54:17.255]  I'd rather just stay here, go to college.
[00:54:17.375 --> 00:54:19.297]  But listen to what his recruiter, Sgt.
[00:54:19.337 --> 00:54:21.058]  Glenn Marquette, told him would happen.
[00:54:21.078 --> 00:54:25.502]  As soon as you get pulled over for a speeding ticket, they're gonna see that you're a deserter.
[00:54:26.835 --> 00:54:28.698]  So guess what?
[00:54:28.899 --> 00:54:34.368]  All that lovey-dovey, I want to go to college and all this, guess what?
[00:54:34.408 --> 00:54:36.953]  You just threw it out the window because you just screwed your life.
[00:54:37.372 --> 00:54:42.255]  Not only is none of that true, it also violates regulations against threatening recruits.
[00:54:42.815 --> 00:54:47.497]  Seventeen-year-old Eric Martinez says he was told the same thing when he changed his mind.
[00:54:47.717 --> 00:54:51.960]  You can go to jail, put a warrant out for you, and spend your time in jail.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.240]  No, that's enough.
[00:54:53.721 --> 00:54:54.221]  That's enough.
[00:54:54.561 --> 00:55:00.684]  It's a hundred times worse, and if you go track these cases a few years ago, there's worse out of Denver and other places.
[00:55:01.485 --> 00:55:05.487]  They get them to sign the form in the principal's office when you get in trouble.
[00:55:06.187 --> 00:55:14.055]  They call you in, because they now have recruiting stations in the schools, and they're on the playground with them, and they're at the football games, and they go, you got in that fist fight, you're going to go to jail for that.
[00:55:14.076 --> 00:55:15.917]  There's a police officer out there to arrest you right now.
[00:55:16.618 --> 00:55:18.821]  Or, you sign this form agreeing to go to the Army.
[00:55:19.795 --> 00:55:23.437]  But because they can't have them sign a binding form until they're at age.
[00:55:23.737 --> 00:55:24.938]  Because they're a minor.
[00:55:24.978 --> 00:55:25.738]  It's a trick form.
[00:55:26.179 --> 00:55:32.042]  Then once they sign the form agreeing tentatively to think about it, then they say, I'm going to arrest you if you don't sign that.
[00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:33.703]  And everybody I know has been told this.
[00:55:34.343 --> 00:55:35.504]  Now, that's the stick.
[00:55:36.144 --> 00:55:38.966]  They have the carrot.
[00:55:39.386 --> 00:55:40.067]  $40,000 signing bonus.
[00:55:40.107 --> 00:55:40.587]  Here's the deal.
[00:55:41.307 --> 00:55:42.828]  They bait and switch and don't give you the money.
[00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:46.851]  Because it's a criminal group.
[00:55:47.901 --> 00:55:49.162]  The government is criminal.
[00:55:49.202 --> 00:55:55.648]  You can say some of the troops aren't criminal, but the system itself is a... Look, they lie and say you gotta take vaccines and there's no law.
[00:55:56.169 --> 00:55:58.070]  They're a pack of criminal scum.
[00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:00.552]  The schools are there to take your children from you.
[00:56:00.753 --> 00:56:01.754]  Do you understand?
[00:56:03.575 --> 00:56:05.077]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:56:05.257 --> 00:56:06.678]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:56:06.998 --> 00:56:09.220]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:56:09.681 --> 00:56:14.385]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:56:14.801 --> 00:56:17.642]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:58:05.721 --> 00:58:08.143]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:58:08.163 --> 00:58:10.705]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:58:10.725 --> 00:58:11.946]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:58:11.966 --> 00:58:13.587]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:58:13.687 --> 00:58:16.469]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:58:16.489 --> 00:58:20.212]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:58:29.877 --> 00:58:35.909]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:58:36.009 --> 00:58:37.112]  An inside job.
[00:58:38.522 --> 00:58:39.603]  How dare you?
[00:58:41.144 --> 00:58:46.029]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:58:46.049 --> 00:58:48.831]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:58:48.931 --> 00:58:55.136]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:59:03.596 --> 00:59:13.360]  SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand knives such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, K-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.481]  South Summit has one of the largest selections of self-defense products on the web.
[00:59:17.602 --> 00:59:27.425]  Knives, stun guns, police batons, pepper spray, LED flashlights, emergency kits, binoculars, and tactical gear are just some of the great products found on SouthSummit.com.
[00:59:27.505 --> 00:59:31.427]  Receive discounted prices on camping and preparedness products from Camelbak, Kelty,
[00:59:31.687 --> 00:59:32.107]  I think so.
[00:59:47.416 --> 00:59:51.457]  So for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, here's what they're sending to young people.
[01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:17.763]  It's got all the ranks and all the little medals they're going to get.
[01:00:18.664 --> 01:00:23.448]  Napoleon made jokes about how people give up their lives just for these little pieces of fabric and metal.
[01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:29.052]  And it's a great thing to fight for your country if it's being invaded or attacked.
[01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:33.856]  But they teach you, no you can't defend yourself, no you can't own firearms, that's bad.
[01:00:34.216 --> 01:00:34.936]  Only join here.
[01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:36.478]  Oh look, football!
[01:00:36.538 --> 01:00:37.999]  It's so much fun in the free calendar.
[01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:53.115]  Meanwhile they lie and terrorize them and tell them they're going to be arrested if they don't join this thing that openly works for the offshore banks and taking over third world countries and now to patrol and police the American people inside the United States.
[01:00:54.434 --> 01:00:58.136]  So all the adventure you're going to have, no really, you're going to be injected with a bunch of cancer viruses.
[01:00:58.676 --> 01:01:19.224]  Never forget when I premiered Endgame in Austin, one of Rick Perry's top people, his media director, shows up to see Endgame, knowing Rick Perry was in it, and he said, oh I'm a big fan, and I want you to know when I worked as a medic at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, they brought in all these special forces guys from Bragg, they gave them shots, and two days later they were all dead, and they had us pull everything out and dump bleach on it and screen it.
[01:01:19.945 --> 01:01:20.205]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:21.246 --> 01:01:22.887]  That's what the government thinks of you, okay?
[01:01:22.907 --> 01:01:25.348]  That's what the government... I'm still... You still work for the government.
[01:01:25.688 --> 01:01:26.609]  You still trust the government.
[01:01:26.629 --> 01:01:31.271]  You still... You know, they know all this stuff is true, but they're still compartmentalized.
[01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:32.212]  This isn't a government.
[01:01:32.232 --> 01:01:34.113]  This is a criminal group.
[01:01:34.693 --> 01:01:36.054]  Oh, but look, it'll be teamwork.
[01:01:36.094 --> 01:01:37.134]  You'll do a great job.
[01:01:37.535 --> 01:01:39.516]  You'll be part of something exciting and fun.
[01:01:39.756 --> 01:01:40.856]  This isn't our government.
[01:01:41.117 --> 01:01:42.317]  This isn't our military.
[01:01:42.597 --> 01:01:47.200]  This works for the bankers that have stolen trillions and trillions of dollars from us, that are bankrupting the nation.
[01:01:49.198 --> 01:01:50.319]  I forgot to get it during the break.
[01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:52.501]  I'm going to get the magazine cover.
[01:01:56.644 --> 01:02:00.807]  Oh look, you'll get all this great technology experience.
[01:02:01.628 --> 01:02:03.409]  It's just going to be wonderful for you.
[01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:08.613]  You're going to work as a team with Chinooks picking up Humvees in the battlefield.
[01:02:10.395 --> 01:02:12.536]  You're going to climb mountains.
[01:02:12.576 --> 01:02:13.637]  You're going to rock climb.
[01:02:13.837 --> 01:02:15.499]  They know that's fun for the kids.
[01:02:17.392 --> 01:02:18.072]  NASCAR.
[01:02:18.092 --> 01:02:20.213]  You're going to be involved with NASCAR.
[01:02:20.614 --> 01:02:21.334]  It's going to be great.
[01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:25.496]  Women, you're going to be flying helicopters.
[01:02:28.297 --> 01:02:31.299]  You're going to be out on the jungle gym, having fun.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.302]  You're going to be out there in the commando, like Warpaint on, fighting out there.
[01:02:40.203 --> 01:02:43.524]  But then if you find out it's all a fraud, like Pat Tillman, they're going to kill you and cover it up.
[01:02:44.285 --> 01:02:45.185]  Your buddies are going to kill you.
[01:02:45.205 --> 01:02:46.566]  They're going to frag you.
[01:02:48.493 --> 01:02:51.775]  He's going to come home and speak out against the war, and it's time to die.
[01:02:52.876 --> 01:02:54.057]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[01:02:54.997 --> 01:02:56.538]  Let's talk to Cullen in Florida.
[01:02:56.578 --> 01:02:57.419]  Cullen, you're on the air.
[01:02:57.939 --> 01:02:58.400]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:58.940]  How are you doing?
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.201]  I'm doing alright.
[01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:01.381]  I think you do great work.
[01:03:01.442 --> 01:03:02.202]  I see all your stuff.
[01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:05.484]  My favorite part in all your movies is when you confront Gergen.
[01:03:05.924 --> 01:03:10.087]  But anyway, this call concerns last Thursday when Joe Rogan was on.
[01:03:10.347 --> 01:03:17.332]  I listened to your show, and you guys were having an interchange about corruption and the usual stuff, and then he said something like,
[01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:22.148]  What if it was the Anunnaki come to the earth or something weird like that?
[01:03:22.248 --> 01:03:24.008]  So I stopped, you know, I listened online.
[01:03:24.488 --> 01:03:30.369]  I stopped it, I googled Anunnaki and I like spent three days pulling my hair out about this.
[01:03:30.909 --> 01:03:33.070]  Bottom line is, have you seen the 2012 preview?
[01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:36.230]  The movie 2012 that's coming out by Emmerich?
[01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:39.831]  Yeah, where the earth is basically destroyed?
[01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:42.071]  Yeah, by the tidal wave or whatever.
[01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:44.332]  The preview is this really ominous thing, this guy in the mountains.
[01:03:44.812 --> 01:03:46.752]  It looks like the Himalayas, the waves coming over the
[01:03:47.347 --> 01:04:03.204]  In any case, I stumbled onto a couple sites that, you know, I got through all the alien crap, and I stumbled onto a couple sites that believe that the South Pole Telescope that was built last year was to track this object that's going to come through our solar system.
[01:04:03.917 --> 01:04:08.058]  And mess up Earth's gravity, and the world governments know it, and they've been... Make a poll shift!
[01:04:08.078 --> 01:04:09.958]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:04:09.978 --> 01:04:24.142]  Let me just... I appreciate it, and I want to hear your comment, but all the movies since 83, and if you look at Emmerich, all the movies he's made are these doomsday sort of Noah's Ark movies, like the Day After Tomorrow he made as well, and it's to confuse the public.
[01:04:24.162 --> 01:04:26.022]  This is their premise, and I want to get your comment on it.
[01:04:26.322 --> 01:04:28.643]  It's to confuse the public so that when something like that happens,
[01:04:29.053 --> 01:04:32.958]  You know, they can stage an alien invasion, they can stage all the stuff that we've been conditioned to see.
[01:04:33.178 --> 01:04:34.400]  Yeah, Project Blue Beam.
[01:04:35.001 --> 01:04:36.262]  Okay, so what do you think?
[01:04:36.282 --> 01:04:37.724]  I mean, what do you think about the South Pole Telescope?
[01:04:37.744 --> 01:04:38.445]  Have you looked at it?
[01:04:38.846 --> 01:04:43.331]  Apparently, there's a couple of YouTube videos of some pictures leaked.
[01:04:44.132 --> 01:04:46.776]  And look, I can't say whether it's true or not, I'm just saying it freaked me out.
[01:04:47.529 --> 01:04:49.050]  So, have you taken a look at that?
[01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:50.111]  Yes, let me comment on it.
[01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:50.991]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:51.472]  Thank you.
[01:04:51.852 --> 01:04:52.752]  Yeah, look.
[01:04:54.293 --> 01:04:57.675]  Giant Homeland Security blimps publicly launched five years ago.
[01:04:58.076 --> 01:05:04.620]  The news, CNN, Larry King Live, ABC, they show them and say, we don't know what it is, the government won't say what it is, it's probably aliens.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.563]  It's a blimp with the rudders, with the fins, with the pods, surveilling the public.
[01:05:09.943 --> 01:05:11.164]  It's a lot cheaper than satellites.
[01:05:12.261 --> 01:05:19.306]  They can put them up there and have them sit at 100,000 feet above the jet streams off solar power and scan you and track you and everything you're doing.
[01:05:21.227 --> 01:05:22.408]  What does that have to do with the Anunnaki?
[01:05:24.343 --> 01:05:25.704]  Well, the media knows those are blimps.
[01:05:25.724 --> 01:05:27.085]  Why are they hyping them up as UFOs?
[01:05:27.105 --> 01:05:28.065]  Because they want to hype this.
[01:05:28.085 --> 01:05:37.570]  So certainly, Hollywood, and the day after tomorrow, and the day the Earth stood still, it's all about doomsday, destruction, aliens coming.
[01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:43.774]  And so when we come back, I'll briefly finish up my comment about what's really behind that.
[01:05:46.172 --> 01:05:50.639]  Then we'll go back to your calls and I'm going to get into some of the news I haven't got to yet.
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:51.821]  Then we'll go back to your calls.
[01:05:52.462 --> 01:05:52.803]  Stay with us.
[01:05:53.504 --> 01:05:54.405]  We're on the march.
[01:05:54.886 --> 01:05:56.489]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:00.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:03.791]  I think so.
[01:06:23.427 --> 01:06:24.167]  We're good to go!
[01:06:50.797 --> 01:06:53.219]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:59.766]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to ALKAVISION.COM.
[01:07:00.046 --> 01:07:01.447]  Again, that's ALKAVISION.COM.
[01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:13.430]  But who is the enemy?
[01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:14.450]  Bin Laden.
[01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:15.711]  This is his MO.
[01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:17.031]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:07:17.091 --> 01:07:18.712]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:07:19.112 --> 01:07:25.856]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:07:26.256 --> 01:07:26.696]  Some U.S.
[01:07:26.736 --> 01:07:32.399]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:07:33.079 --> 01:07:36.582]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:07:36.602 --> 01:07:38.744]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:06.333]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:08:06.493 --> 01:08:10.577]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:08:10.757 --> 01:08:18.725]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:08:19.005 --> 01:08:22.166]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:08:22.406 --> 01:08:28.267]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:08:28.527 --> 01:08:32.908]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:08:33.188 --> 01:08:41.210]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:48.012]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare.
[01:08:52.253 --> 01:08:57.135]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver dot com or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle!
[01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.770]  Don't worry.
[01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:08.711]  This show is documented.
[01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:12.555]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:09:14.657 --> 01:09:19.862]  Listeners are mailing us clippings of Obama being the savior, saving us.
[01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:21.203]  He's saving the Bill of Rights.
[01:09:21.243 --> 01:09:23.265]  He's saving the Constitution from Bush.
[01:09:23.305 --> 01:09:24.786]  It's all torn up in pieces.
[01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:25.847]  He's putting it back together.
[01:09:25.867 --> 01:09:26.888]  We've seen that hundreds of times.
[01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.530]  Look at this.
[01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:29.671]  The new Global Elite.
[01:09:29.711 --> 01:09:31.173]  I showed this about two weeks ago.
[01:09:31.653 --> 01:09:33.375]  Special double issue of Newsweek.
[01:09:33.816 --> 01:09:36.959]  And I wanted to zoom in on this because we were analyzing this closer last night.
[01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:39.711]  And everything is 666.
[01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:44.454]  They'll show three things by three things over and over and over again.
[01:09:44.995 --> 01:09:46.716]  And he's got a crown on.
[01:09:47.437 --> 01:09:51.139]  There's all this mind control, Illuminati symbolism on here.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:10:01.928]  Down here, again, they'll repeat something three times and have it by three times and have it by three times until it forms 666, which is all this Kabbalah stuff.
[01:10:02.928 --> 01:10:10.618]  And what this is, is in Kabbalah they will, as in a lot of other weird mysticism religions, they will draw things.
[01:10:10.658 --> 01:10:17.326]  They believe by showing it, or showing the numbers, or showing, you know, drawing a picture, and then it's like a prayer that it makes it happen.
[01:10:18.027 --> 01:10:26.512]  And again, we told you over a decade ago that Madonna was doing Kabbalah rituals in her concerts, and now for about three years she's been admitting that for over a decade she's been doing that.
[01:10:26.932 --> 01:10:37.458]  So you can laugh at this all day, this is saying the world government, the world elite, list all these world elite around him, are giving all their power under the beast.
[01:10:37.538 --> 01:10:40.360]  I'm not saying he's the Antichrist, I'm saying that's what they believe they're doing.
[01:10:41.681 --> 01:10:46.944]  Okay, now answering the last guy's question, I'm going to go through some more of these Obama Magazine covers, and then some other news, then your calls.
[01:10:48.356 --> 01:10:56.064]  To answer his question, Christians thought that Hitler was the Antichrist in Europe, so they stood down to him.
[01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:02.111]  The Seventh-Day Adventists, the Jehovah's Witnesses, even some of the Baptists
[01:11:03.305 --> 01:11:06.026]  But they weren't so much into the whole, this is the end of the world thing at that time.
[01:11:06.066 --> 01:11:06.707]  Those groups were.
[01:11:07.287 --> 01:11:09.468]  They went, and I'm not bashing any of these groups.
[01:11:09.488 --> 01:11:14.191]  The point is they went along with it and didn't fight back because they thought that it was the end of the world.
[01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:25.057]  And so that's kind of a cop-out in the New World Order version of Christianity to say, well, the rapture's going to happen, nothing, you know, praise God they're calling for microchips and world government because that means we're about to be teleported out of here.
[01:11:25.797 --> 01:11:26.477]  It's ridiculous.
[01:11:26.577 --> 01:11:27.278]  It's not in the Bible.
[01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.351]  Okay.
[01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:32.196]  It says that the beast wages war on the saints and overcomes them.
[01:11:32.516 --> 01:11:33.898]  The saints go through the tribulation.
[01:11:34.759 --> 01:11:36.241]  But if you don't believe in that, that's your issue.
[01:11:36.261 --> 01:11:39.746]  The point is that what they push isn't real Christianity.
[01:11:41.809 --> 01:11:45.572]  Now it's the same thing with Planet X. I remember in 1999 everybody got mad at me.
[01:11:45.612 --> 01:11:46.813]  I said Planet X wasn't real.
[01:11:47.253 --> 01:11:48.014]  It wasn't coming.
[01:11:48.374 --> 01:11:49.415]  It wasn't going to kill us.
[01:11:50.856 --> 01:11:52.617]  And then I predicted the guy writing the book about it.
[01:11:52.898 --> 01:11:54.819]  He said it was coming in 2002.
[01:11:55.239 --> 01:11:58.722]  I said, watch, he'll claim that the Gregorian calendar was wrong and now it's a year later.
[01:11:59.022 --> 01:12:00.504]  And exactly what I predicted he did.
[01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:02.425]  And then they said, oh, it's still coming.
[01:12:02.445 --> 01:12:03.866]  And then people ask me, what about Planet X?
[01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:04.767]  What about the Anunnaki?
[01:12:05.027 --> 01:12:06.208]  It's coming through our solar system.
[01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:07.389]  Do planets come through?
[01:12:07.409 --> 01:12:08.430]  Do planetoids come through?
[01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.091]  Do giant asteroids hit the Earth?
[01:12:10.391 --> 01:12:11.792]  Does it cause massive calamities?
[01:12:12.173 --> 01:12:12.833]  Is this stuff, you know?
[01:12:13.113 --> 01:12:15.035]  Yes, but are they setting the date?
[01:12:16.016 --> 01:12:17.136]  And then you've got the Mayans.
[01:12:17.196 --> 01:12:18.357]  If you really study what they said...
[01:12:19.218 --> 01:12:31.184]  When the Aztecs, in that part of the Mayan culture, who were in power, because it's a Mayan culture with just different tribes, they just said that 2012 was the end of an age and the start up of a new one.
[01:12:32.124 --> 01:12:32.444]  Okay?
[01:12:33.045 --> 01:12:34.786]  And that's in their own text.
[01:12:34.806 --> 01:12:37.687]  So this whole thing about the world ending, but the globalists love that.
[01:12:37.747 --> 01:12:42.289]  They love that idea because then people say, oh screw what's happening with the economy or the banks or the world order.
[01:12:42.569 --> 01:12:43.570]  Why should I fight back?
[01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.890]  2012 it all ends anyways.
[01:12:46.731 --> 01:12:47.252]  Now the
[01:12:48.396 --> 01:12:49.457]  I said I was going to make a JFK film.
[01:12:49.477 --> 01:12:50.617]  I've been working on it for three years.
[01:12:50.797 --> 01:12:55.040]  It's suspended again for the Obama film and it's suspended again for a 2012 film I'm making.
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.160]  That's my next film.
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:13:07.106]  I'm going to rush it out at light speed after Obama so that I can explain that 2012 is a fraud and a lie but that major crises are going to be happening up until that point and after.
[01:13:08.177 --> 01:13:08.537]  Okay.
[01:13:08.998 --> 01:13:10.479]  So we're going to make a 2012 film.
[01:13:11.079 --> 01:13:11.620]  It's happening.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:12.440]  It's in the works.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:13.501]  It's been in the works for years.
[01:13:15.342 --> 01:13:18.305]  I kind of got off on this track last year of I want to be cinema verite.
[01:13:18.725 --> 01:13:19.906]  I want to make a cinema verite film.
[01:13:19.926 --> 01:13:20.306]  And I did.
[01:13:20.346 --> 01:13:21.007]  And it's a great film.
[01:13:21.047 --> 01:13:24.730]  It's the most, quote, entertaining, good to watch, like mainstream, you know, movie.
[01:13:25.987 --> 01:13:29.708]  Truth Rising is excellent, and it was kind of like, oh, as a filmmaker, I want to do this.
[01:13:30.068 --> 01:13:31.168]  I don't have time to do that.
[01:13:31.788 --> 01:13:35.769]  The JFK will be a cinema verite, and it'll end up coming out.
[01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:41.870]  But it's just more important to hit these issues right now.
[01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:47.071]  By the way, the trailer for the Obama deception, my new film, it comes out March 15th.
[01:13:48.571 --> 01:13:50.591]  Normally we make a film in about six months, seven months.
[01:13:50.611 --> 01:13:51.772]  We're making this one in three months.
[01:13:51.912 --> 01:13:53.432]  We've been working on it the last month and a half.
[01:13:54.631 --> 01:14:03.579]  And doing some research before that, over the last four months, but we're doing this in an accelerated program here on top of everything else we're doing, because we know the time is short.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.421]  The enemy's moving against humanity.
[01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:06.762]  The enemy knows the time is short.
[01:14:07.223 --> 01:14:07.783]  And we're doing that.
[01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:09.785]  But there's your answer.
[01:14:10.266 --> 01:14:12.087]  I don't get into aliens and stuff like that.
[01:14:12.808 --> 01:14:14.730]  Is there a government program to have a fake alien landing?
[01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:15.691]  Yeah, that's declassified.
[01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:17.212]  Are they hyping it up in the culture?
[01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:17.572]  Clearly.
[01:14:19.727 --> 01:14:21.769]  And I, you know, talk about that from time to time.
[01:14:22.109 --> 01:14:23.791]  I cover what I can prove.
[01:14:24.151 --> 01:14:25.852]  There is 666 all over this.
[01:14:25.892 --> 01:14:26.713]  This is Kabbalah.
[01:14:28.154 --> 01:14:29.095]  He is wearing a crown.
[01:14:31.377 --> 01:14:33.379]  It is saying global government with both hemispheres.
[01:14:35.701 --> 01:14:38.443]  This is like Church of the Subgenius Illuminati artwork.
[01:14:39.544 --> 01:14:40.205]  Yeah, that's what this is.
[01:14:40.945 --> 01:14:41.706]  And all this other stuff.
[01:14:45.966 --> 01:14:48.128]  44, which is a big Kabbalah number.
[01:14:48.908 --> 01:14:52.532]  Also in the German runes, in the Norse system, that's one of the most powerful numbers.
[01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:53.573]  That and 88.
[01:14:54.274 --> 01:14:55.254]  Same thing with the Chinese.
[01:14:57.937 --> 01:14:58.558]  There's Obama.
[01:14:58.898 --> 01:14:59.478]  Gonna save us.
[01:15:00.019 --> 01:15:01.480]  Hundreds of magazines saying this.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.502]  People are mailing us.
[01:15:03.522 --> 01:15:04.844]  2009 Inauguration Special.
[01:15:04.964 --> 01:15:05.704]  America's Hope.
[01:15:05.724 --> 01:15:06.405]  Barack Obama.
[01:15:07.186 --> 01:15:08.547]  How he will change our world.
[01:15:08.847 --> 01:15:10.008]  What he's gonna do for you.
[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:16.354]  If you turn over yourself and your soul and your mind and your thinking process, they're saying, just do what he says, he'll fix it.
[01:15:16.394 --> 01:15:16.915]  Don't worry about that.
[01:15:17.175 --> 01:15:18.216]  Look at this, Parade Magazine.
[01:15:18.796 --> 01:15:22.099]  What I want for you and every child.
[01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:23.120]  A letter to my daughter.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:27.884]  So, it's like he's talking to his children, but also all of the other children.
[01:15:27.964 --> 01:15:28.804]  He's their father.
[01:15:29.225 --> 01:15:30.045]  He's our father.
[01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:33.248]  And it's all how we're part of his family.
[01:15:33.268 --> 01:15:35.990]  I mean, they didn't do stuff like this for Bush.
[01:15:36.471 --> 01:15:40.514]  The full Beast system, the full New Order system is putting their power behind him right now.
[01:15:42.759 --> 01:15:44.941]  Here's the gay magazine, The Advocate.
[01:15:45.361 --> 01:15:47.343]  What will he do for you first?
[01:15:50.806 --> 01:15:52.667]  What will he do for you first?
[01:15:52.687 --> 01:15:54.429]  And I should have marked it, we're putting this in the film.
[01:15:56.591 --> 01:16:08.941]  It talks about austerity movement, austerity chic, and how not having money is going to be a great thing, and the new Obama thing, and how we've all lived too good and it's been bad for the earth.
[01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:16.911]  Austerity chic.
[01:16:17.672 --> 01:16:18.553]  And how it's chic.
[01:16:18.653 --> 01:16:19.394]  It's stylish.
[01:16:20.956 --> 01:16:25.861]  How novelist and performance artist Mike Albo gets by in lean times.
[01:16:28.564 --> 01:16:29.505]  And then it just goes through that.
[01:16:29.606 --> 01:16:29.766]  Okay.
[01:16:34.039 --> 01:16:47.665]  Here is the classic fascist colors, and I've seen Mussolini posters, Hitler posters, Mao posters, Marx posters, Fidel Castro posters, the same coloration.
[01:16:48.385 --> 01:17:00.831]  And even three weeks ago, the Washington Post did an article admitting that they're using fascist and communist overtones and nomenclature, but said it's for the good of America.
[01:17:01.611 --> 01:17:03.092]  And earlier in the show I talked about how
[01:17:05.213 --> 01:17:09.757]  Well, a caller brought up the point that he told all his conservative friends, don't worry, don't worry about Obama, you're going to like him.
[01:17:09.797 --> 01:17:10.958]  He's acting like an ultra-liberal.
[01:17:11.279 --> 01:17:14.542]  The guy's going to increase the wars, the police state, all of it.
[01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:19.366]  And then now he's come out on national television and said, well, that was all campaign rhetoric.
[01:17:19.707 --> 01:17:20.628]  I agree with Cheney.
[01:17:21.088 --> 01:17:22.229]  I need to do what he did.
[01:17:22.249 --> 01:17:27.294]  I need the new presidential powers that they claimed they had, that I had said was, you know,
[01:17:27.694 --> 01:17:28.954]  Improper power or tyranny.
[01:17:29.335 --> 01:17:31.595]  Because I do need these powers to fix things.
[01:17:32.195 --> 01:17:32.996]  And then here's Newsweek.
[01:17:33.336 --> 01:17:34.596]  What would Dick do?
[01:17:34.676 --> 01:17:38.177]  Why Obama may soon find virtue in Cheney's vision of power.
[01:17:38.197 --> 01:17:39.938]  And that's been the talking point by Cheney and others.
[01:17:40.578 --> 01:17:42.439]  And then, it's Obama.
[01:17:42.659 --> 01:17:49.321]  He doesn't like Cheney, but he's realizing, he's realizing here that he's gotta do it.
[01:17:49.621 --> 01:17:50.561]  Oh, he doesn't like it.
[01:17:51.602 --> 01:17:55.223]  But there he is signing some order and realizing he's gotta do it.
[01:17:57.805 --> 01:18:00.351]  So, classic propaganda there.
[01:18:01.374 --> 01:18:06.827]  Now, I want to get to these articles and then your calls for everybody that's holding.
[01:18:11.681 --> 01:18:17.002]  In Japan, where they have a 1.3, 1.4, depending on which year it is, population growth.
[01:18:17.022 --> 01:18:19.903]  For every two people, on average, they have about 1.2, 1.3, 1.4.
[01:18:21.903 --> 01:18:23.644]  It varies every year, but dropping.
[01:18:24.164 --> 01:18:25.784]  Italy's the same way, Germany, England.
[01:18:26.524 --> 01:18:30.765]  If it wasn't for the immigrant populations coming in, they wouldn't even have the numbers to do the basic jobs.
[01:18:31.905 --> 01:18:36.906]  And the immigrants come in to, you know, pay taxes and things to pay for the people that are retiring on their pensions.
[01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:39.247]  Same thing here with the baby boomers who are starting retirement this year.
[01:18:40.196 --> 01:18:44.177]  Well, they're talking about 70, 80 million people in the next five years going, you know, on retirement.
[01:18:45.418 --> 01:18:47.358]  Workers urge to go home and multiply.
[01:18:47.978 --> 01:18:49.059]  Same thing's going on in Russia.
[01:18:49.619 --> 01:18:52.159]  They've got a 1.3 population growth.
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.060]  In fact, I want to get the exact numbers.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.300]  I haven't looked at them in about a year.
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:19:00.522]  Pull up world population growth numbers.
[01:19:01.222 --> 01:19:02.983]  And it'll pull up an encyclopedia online.
[01:19:03.003 --> 01:19:03.743]  You can see the latest.
[01:19:05.061 --> 01:19:05.321]  Numbers.
[01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:07.523]  We'll test this on air and see if my memory serves right.
[01:19:07.543 --> 01:19:09.565]  I believe Japan's 1.3, but it fluctuates.
[01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:12.427]  Workers urge, go home and multiply.
[01:19:14.108 --> 01:19:22.055]  Even before one reaches the front door of Canon's headquarters in Tokyo, one can sense the virtual stampede of employees pouring out of the building at exactly 5.30 p.m.
[01:19:22.695 --> 01:19:27.339]  And it goes on to say they're being told, go home, have babies, you know, they're going to get money, they're going to get incentives.
[01:19:29.065 --> 01:19:30.526]  Oh, here it is in the article.
[01:19:31.206 --> 01:19:34.987]  As I mentioned this earlier, I haven't read this article yet, but they ran into me.
[01:19:35.127 --> 01:19:50.273]  It says at 1.34, so at 1.3 as I said, it's there in the fifth paragraph, at 1.34, so I said 1.3, a birth rate is well below 2.0 needed to maintain Japan's population according to the country's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
[01:19:50.313 --> 01:19:54.515]  Indigenous Americans, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, meaning your grandparents were born here,
[01:19:56.886 --> 01:19:58.106]  You know, not immigrant families.
[01:19:58.847 --> 01:20:00.267]  I believe the United States is 1.7.
[01:20:00.627 --> 01:20:08.870]  Now we're 2.2 if you count the 30 plus million illegal aliens brought in the last decade.
[01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:12.011]  It's called the death of the West, so there's that.
[01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:16.333]  Now, what is Nancy Pelosi saying about the United States?
[01:20:17.773 --> 01:20:19.034]  Put that up on screen for folks.
[01:20:20.535 --> 01:20:30.562]  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi boldly defended a move to add birth control funding to the new economic stimulus package, claiming contraception will reduce costs to the states and the federal government.
[01:20:30.582 --> 01:20:32.183]  What do you think the HPV shot is?
[01:20:33.024 --> 01:20:38.668]  Pelosi, the mother of five children and six grandchildren who once said, nothing in my life will ever, ever compare to being a mom, and it doesn't.
[01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:39.709]  Being a parent is just magic.
[01:20:40.129 --> 01:20:42.991]  She seemed to imply babies are somehow a burden to the Treasury.
[01:20:44.912 --> 01:20:46.092]  See, America's done for, folks.
[01:20:46.152 --> 01:20:47.353]  We're slated for termination.
[01:20:48.153 --> 01:20:50.554]  And what do you hear Ted Turner and all of them saying?
[01:20:51.794 --> 01:20:52.294]  Same thing.
[01:20:52.374 --> 01:20:59.176]  Fox News, I have a clip of it in the endgame, saying babies are bad for the earth, or carbon footprint, we should only have one baby, we need to tax on people that have more than one baby.
[01:21:00.496 --> 01:21:03.237]  The revelation came during an exchange Sunday morning on ABC's This Week.
[01:21:03.257 --> 01:21:06.438]  Stephanopoulos, hundreds of millions of dollars to expand family planning services.
[01:21:06.478 --> 01:21:07.298]  How is that stimulus?
[01:21:08.779 --> 01:21:09.739]  That means abortion, folks.
[01:21:09.779 --> 01:21:12.440]  Pelosi, what did he sign for Africa and China?
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.480]  Forced abortion in China.
[01:21:15.009 --> 01:21:15.789]  That's the liberalism.
[01:21:16.569 --> 01:21:17.290]  Less black babies.
[01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:19.690]  Well, the family planning services reduce costs.
[01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:20.411]  They reduce costs.
[01:21:20.731 --> 01:21:26.032]  The states are in terrible financial budget crisis, and part of what we do for children's health is education.
[01:21:26.072 --> 01:21:28.973]  Some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial needs.
[01:21:29.453 --> 01:21:35.835]  One of those, on the initiatives you mentioned, the contraception will reduce costs to the states and the federal government.
[01:21:35.855 --> 01:21:36.395]  Stephanopoulos.
[01:21:36.435 --> 01:21:37.695]  So, no apologies for that.
[01:21:37.735 --> 01:21:38.115]  Pelosi.
[01:21:38.155 --> 01:21:38.896]  No apologies, no.
[01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:41.997]  We have to deal with the consequences of the downturn in our economy developing.
[01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:43.317]  So, abortion.
[01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:45.566]  Less babies.
[01:21:45.606 --> 01:21:48.889]  She says less babies is good, more babies bad, abortion good.
[01:21:49.349 --> 01:21:59.396]  As if we don't need new people in the workforce to pay for the baby boom after World War II and 60 to 80 million, depending on how you look at the numbers, in the next 6 to 10 years leaving the workforce.
[01:22:00.696 --> 01:22:02.918]  They're going to replace those with third world populations.
[01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:04.799]  They don't like America.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.520]  You understand that?
[01:22:07.261 --> 01:22:10.323]  They don't like whites, blacks, they don't like indigenous people.
[01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:11.984]  By indigenous, they've been here for hundreds of years.
[01:22:14.241 --> 01:22:16.542]  So, and it's just everywhere.
[01:22:17.362 --> 01:22:18.622]  But in Japan, it's the opposite.
[01:22:20.763 --> 01:22:23.103]  Now, under the Communists, they had these policies in Russia.
[01:22:24.244 --> 01:22:32.946]  Did you guys find an international list of world population growth rates?
[01:22:34.301 --> 01:22:34.941]  That will find it.
[01:22:34.961 --> 01:22:37.862]  Now, I was right, it was 1.3 this year, or last year.
[01:22:38.862 --> 01:22:40.882]  But again, I go off these numbers from my mind.
[01:22:40.902 --> 01:22:41.562]  There aren't always 100%.
[01:22:42.783 --> 01:22:43.803]  That's why you gotta check them.
[01:22:44.203 --> 01:22:50.504]  And that's why I play this little game on air where I check what I'm saying because it's been a couple years since I've seen population numbers and I was right.
[01:22:51.084 --> 01:22:52.204]  That does not mean I'm always right.
[01:22:52.224 --> 01:22:52.704]  Oh, you found them.
[01:22:54.165 --> 01:22:54.745]  Okay.
[01:22:55.705 --> 01:22:56.105]  Let me see.
[01:22:56.185 --> 01:22:56.725]  The regions.
[01:22:56.765 --> 01:23:01.246]  World, Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Caribbean, North America, Oceania.
[01:23:01.266 --> 01:23:01.846]  That's England.
[01:23:03.055 --> 01:23:06.156]  And Ireland, Greenland, and Iceland.
[01:23:08.617 --> 01:23:10.318]  This is broken down in different ways.
[01:23:10.338 --> 01:23:13.720]  I want to see the, this is population growth.
[01:23:16.001 --> 01:23:20.483]  Here's one, right over here, this graph shows Europe, the United States, everybody going down.
[01:23:20.823 --> 01:23:21.483]  This is a good one.
[01:23:22.323 --> 01:23:24.364]  Look at Europe going way down.
[01:23:27.913 --> 01:23:28.613]  England going down.
[01:23:28.633 --> 01:23:31.455]  Remember, there's immigrants flooding these nations, so these are Cook numbers.
[01:23:31.475 --> 01:23:35.037]  It would actually go way down, like a rainbow or a hump.
[01:23:35.738 --> 01:23:36.738]  Asia going way down.
[01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:43.362]  The world growth rate has gone, the speed of the growth has gone way down.
[01:23:43.382 --> 01:23:46.944]  It's going to plane off at about eight and a half billion, all the different studies show.
[01:23:48.605 --> 01:23:53.208]  I'm still trying to find one that just shows the basic, maybe that's not the term to search.
[01:23:54.889 --> 01:23:56.009]  What's the term they use?
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.623]  Well below the needed to maintain Japan's population.
[01:24:04.287 --> 01:24:04.868]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[01:24:05.228 --> 01:24:05.789]  We'll find those.
[01:24:05.809 --> 01:24:07.171]  You can pull those up for yourself.
[01:24:08.766 --> 01:24:11.408]  The point is, is that the best places in Europe have 1.5.
[01:24:12.148 --> 01:24:13.910]  Some of them have 1.2, 1.3.
[01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:15.251]  Same thing in Japan.
[01:24:16.471 --> 01:24:29.861]  And then people are aborting most of the girls in China, so they have hundreds of millions more boys, and they tell them in public service announcements, immigrate to Africa, immigrate to the US, immigrate to Israel, immigrate to other countries and go get their women.
[01:24:33.399 --> 01:24:37.402]  It's not that I'm even saying Chinese men should be able to go around and find a wife whatever color they want.
[01:24:37.662 --> 01:24:40.223]  The point is their government's advertising, you're not getting a woman here.
[01:24:41.344 --> 01:24:43.946]  Go colonize the planet and that's part of their takeover plan.
[01:24:45.887 --> 01:24:48.688]  I mean literally just to get women and their social engineers knew that.
[01:24:49.589 --> 01:24:51.830]  One reason the Vikings would come to England was to grab the women.
[01:24:52.471 --> 01:24:57.614]  So I mean it's the same deal over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:24:59.135 --> 01:25:00.536]  I just hope everybody will visit
[01:25:01.949 --> 01:25:07.092]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now because Obama is bringing in a eugenics agenda.
[01:25:07.172 --> 01:25:11.375]  Taxes and fines and fees and regulations and shutting down family farms and ranches.
[01:25:11.635 --> 01:25:12.656]  You go, how's that going to shut them down?
[01:25:13.316 --> 01:25:24.704]  If you get a $1,000 a day fine if your cow dies or runs off or gets hit by a car, they get out and you don't immediately file by computer and pay a fine, a fee to be able to do that, to tell them your cow died.
[01:25:24.944 --> 01:25:29.107]  You get a $1,000 a day fine when they find out your cow got struck by lightning and then coyotes ate it.
[01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:30.728]  And cows get killed all the time.
[01:25:31.428 --> 01:25:32.889]  They just get sick and fall over dead.
[01:25:34.811 --> 01:25:37.673]  Sometimes you leave some plastic out, cows will eat it, it gets in their stomach and they die.
[01:25:38.094 --> 01:25:41.757]  Thousand dollar day fines, twenty dollar little ring that goes around the chicken.
[01:25:42.157 --> 01:25:45.200]  You can't sell the chicken for five dollars wholesale.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:51.786]  But you got a twenty dollar ring around its neck or on its wing under the Animal ID Act.
[01:25:52.326 --> 01:25:53.227]  It shuts you down.
[01:25:54.208 --> 01:25:55.109]  But guess who's exempt?
[01:25:55.169 --> 01:25:57.431]  Tyson, who helped write the Animal ID Law.
[01:25:57.731 --> 01:25:58.852]  They don't have those costs.
[01:25:59.943 --> 01:26:02.427]  So they can wholesale sell their chickens for $2 or $3.
[01:26:03.068 --> 01:26:05.431]  Your chicken's going to cost $25 when you sell it.
[01:26:06.012 --> 01:26:07.114]  Nobody's going to buy from you.
[01:26:09.137 --> 01:26:12.181]  Meanwhile, they've got SWAT teams raiding people all over the country selling eggs and milk.
[01:26:13.021 --> 01:26:13.581]  And cheese.
[01:26:14.202 --> 01:26:14.722]  The Amish.
[01:26:15.182 --> 01:26:15.783]  The Mennonites.
[01:26:15.823 --> 01:26:16.963]  And private people out there living.
[01:26:17.204 --> 01:26:19.145]  I mean, this is an attack on everybody.
[01:26:19.225 --> 01:26:20.846]  Carbon taxes on everything you do.
[01:26:21.186 --> 01:26:22.046]  Everything you sell.
[01:26:22.447 --> 01:26:23.387]  On life itself.
[01:26:23.407 --> 01:26:24.968]  With a cashless society grid.
[01:26:25.168 --> 01:26:27.069]  With a new national sales tax they're going to push.
[01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:29.711]  Which then tracks all your purchases and what you do.
[01:26:29.731 --> 01:26:32.332]  Because it's going to be a fair sales tax that's graduated.
[01:26:32.673 --> 01:26:34.554]  Where, and that's in quotes when I say fair.
[01:26:34.974 --> 01:26:38.016]  Where people who have low incomes won't have to pay the sales tax.
[01:26:38.036 --> 01:26:41.358]  But you'll still have to swipe the card to show that
[01:26:42.409 --> 01:26:45.751]  You, A, deserve to be in the lower bracket and don't have side jobs.
[01:26:45.971 --> 01:26:51.075]  They'll know if you've got too much money that you're not in the right tax bracket or that you're working in the black market.
[01:26:51.455 --> 01:26:56.298]  This is all about micromanaging, social engineering, everything you do, every facet of your life.
[01:26:56.579 --> 01:26:58.300]  Take a bunch of calls in the final segment.
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:02.723]  The new trailer is up on InfoWars.com with the Obama deception.
[01:27:03.303 --> 01:27:08.026]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[01:27:08.387 --> 01:27:11.609]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free.
[01:27:11.997 --> 01:27:12.417]  I'm good to go!
[01:27:38.615 --> 01:27:45.877]  HempUSA.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[01:27:46.497 --> 01:27:53.299]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[01:27:54.119 --> 01:27:59.000]  So don't delay, call today, 908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[01:28:03.502 --> 01:28:05.164]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:28:05.485 --> 01:28:08.909]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:10.932]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:28:11.413 --> 01:28:14.276]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:28:14.597 --> 01:28:18.422]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[01:28:18.422 --> 01:28:18.802]  We're good to go.
[01:28:48.424 --> 01:28:50.506]  Exclusive audio interviews and so much more.
[01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:53.328]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[01:28:53.689 --> 01:28:55.330]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:57.532]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.534]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[01:28:59.854 --> 01:29:01.275]  Bring down the new world order.
[01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:02.396]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:29:03.573 --> 01:29:06.616]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:29:07.057 --> 01:29:10.361]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:29:10.841 --> 01:29:16.788]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:29:17.148 --> 01:29:21.253]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:27.497]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:29:27.797 --> 01:29:30.859]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:35.622]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:29:35.863 --> 01:29:41.807]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:29:42.087 --> 01:29:46.730]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:50.973]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[01:29:51.493 --> 01:29:54.036]  That's mysolarbackup.com today.
[01:29:54.316 --> 01:29:54.897]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:54.917 --> 01:29:55.057]  877-327-0365.
[01:29:55.238 --> 01:29:55.698]  Don't wait.
[01:29:55.758 --> 01:29:56.359]  Call today.
[01:30:13.858 --> 01:30:18.423]  I promised to go to these callers, so we're going to go into about 10 minutes of overdrive.
[01:30:18.804 --> 01:30:23.409]  Guys, punch up the Austin Command Center phone number so I can give it to people, please.
[01:30:25.011 --> 01:30:29.435]  And John, Patrick, Nate, Craig, Tom, and Patrick in the UK, that's going to be it.
[01:30:31.658 --> 01:30:33.300]  Because there's a bunch of other news I need to...
[01:30:34.901 --> 01:30:39.825]  You know, talking about how they're domesticating us, institutionalizing us.
[01:30:39.885 --> 01:30:46.670]  In England, if somebody breaks into your house and is stabbing you, and you push them out a window or beat their brains out with a baseball bat, you are charged.
[01:30:47.591 --> 01:30:48.852]  And then they sue you and win money.
[01:30:50.342 --> 01:30:52.043]  Again, they don't want you defending yourself.
[01:30:52.944 --> 01:30:57.107]  They're announcing they're not going to let the British Coast Guard go out and save people now if it's dangerous for them.
[01:30:57.127 --> 01:31:06.734]  They have to fill out a 30-minute form, it's said to take, about where they're going, what the weather is before they're... See, again, it's about nobody can protect themselves except the deadly SWAT teams and the paramilitary police.
[01:31:07.434 --> 01:31:10.836]  They get more violent and out of control, we're all domesticated, including other people.
[01:31:11.017 --> 01:31:15.860]  They're talking about disarming most police, by the way, here in the U.S., where only the special paramilitaries are armed.
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:16.981]  And they're totally vicious.
[01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:23.952]  Look at this, you know, they've banned dodgeball and tag and running at recess saying it's violent.
[01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:28.113]  Unapologetic coach, 100-0 win, fired from school.
[01:31:28.133 --> 01:31:36.695]  The coach of a Texas high school basketball team, beat another team 100-0, was fired Sunday, the same day he sent an email to the newspaper saying he will not apologize for a wide margin victory.
[01:31:36.735 --> 01:31:41.117]  See, now they're talking about not allowing scores, not allowing, that's socialism.
[01:31:41.957 --> 01:31:46.719]  You see, they want to control people that are upwardly mobile, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:46.739 --> 01:31:50.241]  This is the control system that we're talking about here.
[01:31:51.022 --> 01:31:52.982]  And again, I just want to plug for everybody one more time.
[01:31:53.303 --> 01:31:55.704]  The new Obama deception trailer is up.
[01:31:56.164 --> 01:31:57.425]  March 15th, it's coming out.
[01:32:00.899 --> 01:32:03.940]  You know, I just picked that date, saying it was the middle of the month, sounded like a good day.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:07.500]  And then Aaron goes, you know, because he looked it up, that's the Ides of March.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:15.842]  I said, well, this is saying we want to end the tyranny, but peacefully, you know, kill the idea of socialism, communism, but peacefully.
[01:32:16.442 --> 01:32:20.443]  And then I was just informed it's Zeitgeist Z-Day, no intention to do that, but it doesn't matter.
[01:32:21.443 --> 01:32:23.303]  It's a good date then, a lot of people, I guess, picked it for things.
[01:32:23.883 --> 01:32:26.584]  So the film, The Obama Deception, is coming out March 15th.
[01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:40.068]  Before I start taking calls before the show ends, the number for the listeners that are holding right now at Genesis, we're going to turn the phone system on right now, just the callers that are holding, John, Patrick, Nate, Craig, and Tom.
[01:32:40.448 --> 01:32:45.350]  I'll go to you in overdrive just for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWare streamlisters so we at least get to you.
[01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:46.550]  The number is 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[01:32:54.454 --> 01:32:59.179]  Now, before I end the show, I do want to just briefly tell you about the Cola Blue.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:03.244]  And again, it's just an amazing atmospheric water generator system.
[01:33:03.664 --> 01:33:06.247]  It grabs 7.5 gallons on average a day out of the air.
[01:33:06.627 --> 01:33:12.574]  We have one here in the office, back in the back office, and it's getting about 2 gallons a day because it's only 20% humidity in here.
[01:33:13.905 --> 01:33:18.507]  We had the other office at 40% humidity on average and it would fill up more than seven gallons a day.
[01:33:19.067 --> 01:33:20.407]  The point is it's an amazing system.
[01:33:20.427 --> 01:33:21.808]  They have bigger units if you want that.
[01:33:22.288 --> 01:33:25.749]  The best place to put it is your back porch where it doesn't get rained on but where it has higher humidity.
[01:33:26.130 --> 01:33:28.250]  Great tasting pure H2O exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:29.551]  No chemicals, pollutants or toxins.
[01:33:29.911 --> 01:33:33.352]  Neutral pH and it goes through seven filters inside.
[01:33:33.392 --> 01:33:39.875]  Reverse osmosis, tasting, odor removal, UV light, on and on and on, antibacterial filter.
[01:33:40.675 --> 01:33:43.659]  Also, the machine comes in colors red, black, white, green, silver, and blue.
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:45.501]  We have a black one here at the office.
[01:33:45.521 --> 01:33:46.423]  I have a black one at home.
[01:33:46.443 --> 01:33:46.903]  866-585-4044.
[01:33:46.923 --> 01:33:47.444]  866-585-4044. acolablue.com.
[01:33:47.464 --> 01:33:48.025]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:33:56.275 --> 01:33:57.537]  Check it out today.
[01:33:57.757 --> 01:33:59.580]  And please continue to support us.

[01:34:03.445 --> 01:34:05.068]  We carry all the other great films as well.

[01:34:13.137 --> 01:34:17.199]  We had an important broadcast today, covered a lot of issues, took a lot of phone calls.
[01:34:17.459 --> 01:34:25.144]  And for everybody on the AM and FM dial, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 3 Central, or on stations at Rieras throughout the evening and the morning.
[01:34:26.224 --> 01:34:30.727]  But for everybody on the internet streams, the show restarts now at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:30.747 --> 01:34:37.571]  We'll be live continually at those exclusive free audio streams right now at InfoWars.com and streaming for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:37.611 --> 01:34:40.792]  Members, to take your phone calls as we go into overdrive.
[01:34:40.832 --> 01:34:41.713]  Great job to the crew.

[01:34:53.106 --> 01:34:53.686]  Hello, friends.
[01:34:53.746 --> 01:34:54.687]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:34:54.807 --> 01:34:59.391]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:34:59.551 --> 01:35:02.294]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:35:02.514 --> 01:35:05.377]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:35:05.557 --> 01:35:10.261]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:35:10.501 --> 01:35:11.421]  If you simply prepare.
[01:35:11.621 --> 01:35:14.543]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:35:14.863 --> 01:35:21.746]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:35:21.866 --> 01:35:24.967]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:35:25.127 --> 01:35:25.387]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:35:27.808 --> 01:35:30.049]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:35:30.269 --> 01:35:36.332]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:35:36.532 --> 01:35:40.293]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:35:40.313 --> 01:35:41.534]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:35:41.574 --> 01:35:42.234]  Take action today.
[01:35:42.274 --> 01:35:44.095]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:35:55.728 --> 01:36:00.491]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:36:00.911 --> 01:36:01.491]  That's right.
[01:36:02.632 --> 01:36:04.233]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:36:04.273 --> 01:36:06.474]  We're going to do about 10 minutes of overdrive here.
[01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:12.157]  Then I'm going to go in there and start battling to work on the Obama deception.
[01:36:12.858 --> 01:36:23.684]  But right now, as promised, we're going to go ahead and go to folks' phone calls here and then end this transmission and go back to the re-transmission.
[01:36:25.488 --> 01:36:27.929]  But you guys go ahead and punch me up the phone call list.
[01:36:27.989 --> 01:36:28.349]  Thank you.
[01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:29.690]  Oh, we're still getting their names.
[01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:33.631]  I want to be able to finish up with the folks that we're holding on the Genesis phone line system.
[01:36:33.891 --> 01:36:37.132]  That's the only problem with Genesis running it when we're live on the AM and FM.
[01:36:37.192 --> 01:36:41.494]  And then we go here live, we've got to have folks call that other number.
[01:36:42.655 --> 01:36:46.156]  But we will be going to those here in just a moment.
[01:36:47.441 --> 01:36:49.182]  I was just covering this at the end of the show.
[01:36:49.742 --> 01:36:55.106]  Unapologetic coach of 100-0 win fired by school.
[01:36:56.086 --> 01:36:57.247]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[01:36:58.468 --> 01:37:02.970]  The coach of a Texas high school basketball team that beat another team 100-0 was fired Sunday.
[01:37:03.311 --> 01:37:09.134]  The same day he sent an email to the newspaper saying he will not apologize for a wide margin victory when the girls played with honor and integrity.
[01:37:12.352 --> 01:37:18.381]  Cooley, the headmaster of the Covenant Schools at the Dallas Morning News Online Edition, that he could not answer.
[01:37:18.762 --> 01:37:26.033]  The firing was a direct result of Coach Micah Grimes' email disagreeing with administrators who called the blowout shameful.
[01:37:27.537 --> 01:37:30.358]  He did not immediately answer phone calls or emails from the Associated Press.
[01:37:30.458 --> 01:37:38.199]  On its website last week, Covenant, a private Christian school, posted a statement regretting the outcome of its January 13th shutout.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.560]  See, they take these games so seriously, folks.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:47.482]  You know, the times I lost games, the times I got beat up by bigger kids, the times bad things happened to me only made me stronger.
[01:37:48.082 --> 01:37:52.703]  But we teach kids, instead of getting strong and coming back or doing better, or that was just a much better team,
[01:37:54.406 --> 01:37:56.087]  That, oh no, it's not okay to excel.
[01:37:56.347 --> 01:38:00.731]  But then it's, you can't play dodgeball, you can't play baseball, you can't have jungle gyms.
[01:38:01.191 --> 01:38:05.814]  And then they're saying if your parents have jungle gyms and you break your finger or your arm, something happened to most of us.
[01:38:05.834 --> 01:38:08.957]  I mean, who broke bones out there as a kid on their bike riding around?
[01:38:09.657 --> 01:38:10.458]  Whose would you break?
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:20.045]  I broke my hands, I broke my fingers repeatedly flying off bikes or falling out of trees, broke my nose, got a concussion.
[01:38:20.965 --> 01:38:21.626]  Are you on air right now?
[01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:25.603]  We need to hook that mic up so we can actually be on air, not just me talking to you.
[01:38:25.984 --> 01:38:28.504]  But, yeah, Jaron, did you ever break stuff?
[01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:30.824]  What, did you break your thumb?
[01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:38.826]  Well, now, even if you go to the hospital and say, I broke my thumb falling off my bike, CPS will come in and say, well, were you allowed to be out?
[01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:40.666]  Well, you weren't old enough to be out riding your bike.
[01:38:40.686 --> 01:38:41.727]  Well, we're going to go ahead and take you.
[01:38:42.467 --> 01:38:43.447]  Oh, and you've got some siblings.
[01:38:43.467 --> 01:38:45.087]  We're going to go ahead and try to take those children, too.
[01:38:45.547 --> 01:38:47.588]  That is how terrorist this government is.
[01:38:47.868 --> 01:38:49.108]  How criminal, how disgusting.
[01:38:50.953 --> 01:38:53.775]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Tom in New Jersey.
[01:38:53.815 --> 01:38:54.656]  You're on the air.
[01:38:54.696 --> 01:38:55.056]  Go ahead.
[01:38:55.777 --> 01:38:56.398]  Mr. Alex.
[01:38:57.018 --> 01:38:57.218]  Hi.
[01:38:57.519 --> 01:38:58.499]  Pleasure to speak to you.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.222]  I just wanted to reiterate some of your points that you've been making.
[01:39:03.143 --> 01:39:04.705]  First off, knowledge is power.
[01:39:05.986 --> 01:39:16.875]  I feel, you know, we were based on a foundation of a nation that was based on principle, and they've turned the shambles into a nation that is overwhelmed by interest.
[01:39:18.456 --> 01:39:19.197]  I always felt that.
[01:39:20.237 --> 01:39:24.301]  It's not how much money that you do make, it's how much money you don't have to spend.
[01:39:28.644 --> 01:39:37.212]  I think the most important thing is the money isn't everything, but the value of the money is very important.
[01:39:39.094 --> 01:39:39.414]  Do you agree?
[01:39:40.165 --> 01:39:45.107]  Well, I mean, having money is about being independent, not having others control you, so it's a good thing.
[01:39:45.448 --> 01:39:54.332]  In a hierarchy of needs, though, you shouldn't put money on the top of your honor, your name, who you are, what you build, what you stand for.
[01:39:54.752 --> 01:39:59.074]  It's way down the hierarchy of needs, on top of the pyramid of the hierarchy of needs.
[01:39:59.414 --> 01:40:05.978]  Number one is being a good person, being honorable, and leaving this world in a better situation than you came into it.
[01:40:06.318 --> 01:40:08.559]  Oh, definitely understood, but my point is,
[01:40:09.358 --> 01:40:14.262]  That the devaluing of our money is where they're stealing our wealth from.
[01:40:14.422 --> 01:40:17.725]  Well, they're stealing it at every angle in this controlled, parasitic economy.
[01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:22.149]  But yes, they're devaluing it, which is a hidden inflation tax.
[01:40:22.409 --> 01:40:23.630]  And punishes people that save.
[01:40:24.431 --> 01:40:26.572]  Yes, we've been under attack in this country since 1913.
[01:40:26.672 --> 01:40:30.696]  And re-emphasized in 1933 when Roosevelt took us off the gold standard.
[01:40:30.756 --> 01:40:33.998]  And then again in 1976 when Nixon took us off the silver.
[01:40:39.079 --> 01:40:44.701]  And ever since then, we've been losing most of our wealth through the government inflation.
[01:40:45.562 --> 01:40:50.944]  Which, actually, they're very smart, because the more money that they print, the more money that sticks to their fingers.
[01:40:52.224 --> 01:41:08.811]  Because we have to pay more money back on taxes, which I'd like to say that when you fill out an illegal income tax return, you're filling it out to justify how much profit or loss you've made in dollars.
[01:41:10.319 --> 01:41:21.265]  We are stupid enough to fill out the income tax form, but we are paying taxes on what we've profited or lost.
[01:41:21.826 --> 01:41:25.148]  Yeah, we didn't have an income tax until 1913, as you know, and it's a fraud.
[01:41:25.168 --> 01:41:25.988]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:26.368 --> 01:41:27.329]  Tom, good to hear from you.
[01:41:27.349 --> 01:41:28.109]  Craig in New York.
[01:41:28.509 --> 01:41:29.470]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:41:30.591 --> 01:41:36.774]  Hi Alex, I was just calling up because I'm a teacher and you were talking about the brainwashing Obama stuff in school.
[01:41:37.869 --> 01:41:39.530]  It's called Social Reconstructionism.
[01:41:39.570 --> 01:41:45.552]  You can't get a teaching degree without learning about it, reading George S. Counts, Childhood Schools Built a New Social Order.
[01:41:45.572 --> 01:41:47.352]  Nonsense like that.
[01:41:47.392 --> 01:41:50.633]  And that's why now in schools, kids don't actually learn anything important.
[01:41:50.653 --> 01:41:52.534]  They have to do group work and plays.
[01:41:52.994 --> 01:41:56.895]  They learn how to work together, not stand up, not be individuals, be a board.
[01:41:56.975 --> 01:42:00.556]  And yet the kids that are failing are given better grades.
[01:42:00.636 --> 01:42:01.357]  They're supposed to.
[01:42:01.857 --> 01:42:05.938]  I forget what the thing is called, but you're supposed to give them better grades than the kids that work hard.
[01:42:06.434 --> 01:42:10.938]  So you're taking away motives, and the whole reason why people want to work hard is for rewards.
[01:42:11.058 --> 01:42:11.638]  I mean, that's natural.
[01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:16.282]  And it's going on in the private schools just as bad, as evidenced by this.
[01:42:16.302 --> 01:42:19.124]  People think the private schools, in some cases they're even worse.
[01:42:19.805 --> 01:42:26.650]  Of course, because they're going to colleges like Teachers College, Columbia University, Stanford, Teachers College, and they teach all the same pedagogy.
[01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:31.894]  It's mostly well-meaning people, but they've been totally brainwashed by national educational standards.
[01:42:32.364 --> 01:42:37.152]  And the educational philosophers that have been writing about the New World Order, John Dewey, in the 1910s.
[01:42:37.212 --> 01:42:41.658]  Yeah, they all said to have a socialist America, but again, not for the people.
[01:42:42.742 --> 01:43:08.991]  For the bankers to knock out the middle class, where nobody can ever resist them, where everybody's poor, but the elite are international above us, where nobody can be individual, nobody can do better than anybody else, and then it just holds back everybody, including the students that, you know, may not excel at calculus or at engineering, you know, that are supposed to go out and, you know, be an entrepreneur or play sports or, you know, do something else.
[01:43:10.455 --> 01:43:11.876]  Well, they think that's progress.
[01:43:11.956 --> 01:43:19.840]  They think they know what's better for people, and these are the same people that were behind social control years ago during the Progressive Era, that we are dumb.
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.581]  They should use euthanetics, not eugenics.
[01:43:21.661 --> 01:43:27.644]  Euthanetics is where you brainwash people to make them better and control what they do, because they can't run their own lives.
[01:43:28.065 --> 01:43:28.805]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:30.086 --> 01:43:32.827]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nate in Maine.
[01:43:33.267 --> 01:43:34.068]  Nate, you're on the air.
[01:43:35.236 --> 01:43:36.096]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:36.456 --> 01:43:46.259]  I woke up this morning and I heard, I haven't got all the specifics on it yet, but over here in Lewiston, Maine, there was a scuffle between a young man and a cop.
[01:43:47.119 --> 01:43:49.460]  And from what I heard, he was just running away.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.980]  He didn't have any weapons.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.301]  It was just a hand-to-hand physical scuffle.
[01:43:53.321 --> 01:44:00.303]  And he's running through the woods and he gets shot three times in the back and once in the head, killed dead.
[01:44:01.243 --> 01:44:03.244]  And now they're talking about having a
[01:44:04.546 --> 01:44:10.151]  A citizen watch to evaluate what happens when a police gets shot in Maine.
[01:44:10.831 --> 01:44:11.652]  It's a mess.
[01:44:13.293 --> 01:44:24.163]  And then every time the citizens combine forces now to try to take back their government and have justice, the Obamanoids, the counterfeit of a true grassroots movement, will be employed.
[01:44:24.784 --> 01:44:24.964]  Yep.
[01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:33.236]  I know you have limited time, so I just want to leave it at that and say, that's to the New World Order.
[01:44:33.536 --> 01:44:34.477]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:44:35.177 --> 01:44:37.099]  One last caller, Nick in North Carolina.
[01:44:37.119 --> 01:44:37.859]  Nick, you're on the air.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.841]  Hey, Alex, good to talk to you again.
[01:44:40.741 --> 01:44:46.125]  I was watching T-Span late last night and I saw a guy on there that you might want to talk to, although he could be a neocon.
[01:44:46.786 --> 01:44:51.589]  This guy, Peter Wallison from the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank.
[01:44:52.316 --> 01:45:01.541]  Um, was up there talking about the most pernicious plot he heard going around, which was to have a regulator for quote, systematically significant institutions.
[01:45:02.563 --> 01:45:07.586]  Again, he basically said that this was just a plot to get regulation over as many banks and companies as possible.
[01:45:07.607 --> 01:45:08.647]  No, no, that's what's happening.
[01:45:08.907 --> 01:45:17.493]  The upper crust of the elite banks that control the issuance of currency, they're not even banks, they're crime syndicates, are taking over banks, insurance companies, industry.
[01:45:17.813 --> 01:45:23.697]  They're going to have a world government run by the banks that regulates everything, including our taxing system, everything.
[01:45:23.977 --> 01:45:29.061]  That's what the IMF and World Bank and International Bank of Settlements do to third world countries they go in and bankrupt.
[01:45:29.321 --> 01:45:30.142]  They take them over!
[01:45:30.882 --> 01:45:33.505]  So no matter what government you put in, it's the same policies.
[01:45:33.865 --> 01:45:34.846]  Same thing with Iceland.
[01:45:35.167 --> 01:45:38.751]  They've just kicked out their government after a month and a half of rioting.
[01:45:39.972 --> 01:45:44.156]  Overnight they went from one of the wealthiest nations in the world, I mean they were out there with Switzerland.
[01:45:44.817 --> 01:45:46.379]  It was hard to tell who was number one.
[01:45:46.839 --> 01:45:48.040]  Was it Iceland or was it Switzerland?
[01:45:48.701 --> 01:45:59.629]  And overnight, because the banks came in and bought off their government and did these derivative scams, they're told your bank accounts are empty, everything's, you know, done, there's no credit to bring food into the country, everything's bankrupt.
[01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:04.952]  And so now they go and remove the government, but that happens in third world nations.
[01:46:04.972 --> 01:46:06.694]  That's happened in Argentina and Brazil.
[01:46:06.954 --> 01:46:15.220]  They'll just put president after prime minister after president after leader in these countries who've signed corporate agreements that nobody's talking about with the offshore banks.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:16.821]  And then Gordon Brown a month ago
[01:46:17.401 --> 01:46:28.865]  When the Icelanders were trying to go to England to get their money out of British banks, because the British really own Iceland, Gordon Brown used a terrorism law to block hundreds of thousands of Icelanders.
[01:46:28.885 --> 01:46:30.646]  You can pull this up, Financial Times of London.
[01:46:31.166 --> 01:46:32.006]  In fact, Google that.
[01:46:32.266 --> 01:46:35.888]  Gordon Brown uses terror law against Icelanders.
[01:46:37.368 --> 01:46:37.708]  Okay?
[01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:41.830]  And then they use their British Patriot Act to say you can't have your money.
[01:46:43.659 --> 01:46:46.961]  You understand the level of the heist we're talking about?
[01:46:47.341 --> 01:46:49.542]  This whole anti-terrorism thing is for us!
[01:46:50.443 --> 01:46:52.484]  All these stupid yuppies think they're part of the system.
[01:46:52.724 --> 01:46:54.845]  It isn't for Al Qaeda, boys, it's for you!
[01:46:54.865 --> 01:46:56.226]  Go ahead.
[01:46:56.286 --> 01:46:58.647]  You know where he said this was all coming from?
[01:46:58.667 --> 01:46:59.148]  You'll love this.
[01:46:59.688 --> 01:47:02.129]  He said all these plots were coming from the group of 30.
[01:47:02.209 --> 01:47:03.870]  Surely no surprise to you.
[01:47:04.931 --> 01:47:07.812]  So they had Peter Wallinson?
[01:47:08.533 --> 01:47:10.394]  Yeah, W-A-L-L-I-S-O-N.
[01:47:12.446 --> 01:47:15.328]  And he's with uh... American Enterprise Institute.
[01:47:15.348 --> 01:47:16.969]  It looks like they're all over the Bush administration.
[01:47:17.029 --> 01:47:19.271]  So it makes me dubious.
[01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:20.431]  He was talking straight dope.
[01:47:20.591 --> 01:47:21.232]  There was no joke.
[01:47:23.153 --> 01:47:25.215]  So they've even got neocons.
[01:47:25.815 --> 01:47:26.716]  Peter Wallinson.
[01:47:27.416 --> 01:47:28.937]  American Enterprise Institute.
[01:47:28.957 --> 01:47:29.938]  Folks, write that down.
[01:47:30.138 --> 01:47:31.659]  I want to have Aaron get him on.
[01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:36.402]  He was coming right out admitting... He was against it.
[01:47:36.422 --> 01:47:39.224]  He called it the most pernicious idea he heard going around.
[01:47:39.244 --> 01:47:39.384]  He said,
[01:47:41.107 --> 01:47:47.393]  They wanted to regulate systematically significant institutions, and that this was just an excuse to basically regulate everything they could.
[01:47:47.793 --> 01:47:52.958]  Separate from him, you know, we hear everything's screwed up, we didn't have enough regulation, when they had tons of regulations.
[01:47:53.338 --> 01:47:57.442]  The very banks that engineered this are now saying they're going to control industry.
[01:47:57.462 --> 01:48:06.210]  When you hear nationalization of Ford or Chevy or GM, when you hear nationalization of your cities, that just means under the IMF World Bank Plan,
[01:48:07.216 --> 01:48:12.120]  That they force the cities and states to sign on to a hundred-plus part IMF World Bank plan.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:13.221]  This is in my book.
[01:48:14.301 --> 01:48:15.082]  A dissent in a tyranny.
[01:48:16.643 --> 01:48:19.065]  And I said they're going to force us in the next eight years to do this.
[01:48:19.085 --> 01:48:21.607]  Well, here we are, seven years later.
[01:48:21.787 --> 01:48:22.367]  Six years later.
[01:48:23.568 --> 01:48:25.230]  I mean, it's happening.
[01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.710]  It's happening.
[01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:26.010]  Go ahead.
[01:48:26.991 --> 01:48:33.816]  You've already heard the Woodrow Wilson quote where he talks about there's a power so subtle that men dare not talk about over their breasts.
[01:48:35.223 --> 01:48:37.504]  Um, okay, from 1913, his book, The New Freedom.
[01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.124]  I, uh, went scanning through that book.
[01:48:39.144 --> 01:48:40.544]  There is all kinds of stuff in there, Alex.
[01:48:40.584 --> 01:48:41.404]  You should take a look at it.
[01:48:41.444 --> 01:48:43.385]  I want to just, uh, read one quote real quick.
[01:48:44.285 --> 01:48:51.366]  Um, he says, further down, he says, uh, what most of us are fighting for is to break up this very partnership between big business and the government.
[01:48:51.406 --> 01:49:03.369]  We call upon all intelligent men to bear witness that if this plan were consummated, the great employers and capitalists of the country would be under a more overpowering temptation than ever to take control of the government and keep it subservient to their purpose.
[01:49:03.829 --> 01:49:11.318]  What a prize it would be to capture how unavailable would be the majesty and the tyranny of monopoly if it could thus get sanction of law and the authority of government.
[01:49:11.498 --> 01:49:17.285]  By what means, except open revolt, could we ever break the crust of our life again and become free men?
[01:49:19.158 --> 01:49:19.818]  Do me a favor.
[01:49:20.039 --> 01:49:21.360]  I am familiar with Wilson.
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.683]  Remember, he wrote the book, The New World Order, as a top professor.
[01:49:27.904 --> 01:49:29.205]  They then conned him.
[01:49:30.106 --> 01:49:33.468]  And then right before he had a stroke, they poisoned him.
[01:49:33.788 --> 01:49:36.550]  He wrote letters and went public saying international bankers have taken over.
[01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:37.671]  The New World Order is all a fraud.
[01:49:37.991 --> 01:49:38.512]  Don't do it.
[01:49:39.412 --> 01:49:41.093]  And everybody who wants to see quotes
[01:49:42.470 --> 01:50:04.452]  Uh, Ian, because I know that quote, but I'll end up forgetting, send those quotes to Aaron2A's and InfoWars.com, because I'm going to have some quotes about the bankers and about what Founding Fathers said, Thomas Jefferson and others, but that Woodrow Wilson one is good, in the film, but so before I forget, I actually had that written, because while I've been sitting here thinking on air today,
[01:50:05.498 --> 01:50:06.718]  So I don't interrupt people as bad.
[01:50:06.758 --> 01:50:11.119]  I have a tendency to write notes of things I wanted to say and things I wanted to do.
[01:50:11.159 --> 01:50:14.260]  I'm trying to find my piece of paper here that had those notes.
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:18.120]  But yeah, send the quotes to Aaron at InfoWars.com that you think we need to use.
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.741]  And of course we'll go about them and check them, but I am familiar with that quote.
[01:50:20.781 --> 01:50:21.581]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:50:22.921 --> 01:50:23.902]  You couldn't say it any better.
[01:50:24.142 --> 01:50:27.762]  Okay, we're going to go back into rebroadcast right now from the streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:27.782 --> 01:50:29.343]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:50:29.383 --> 01:50:29.663]  live.
[01:50:30.183 --> 01:50:31.003]  God bless you all.
[01:50:31.966 --> 01:50:33.407]  Because we are not going to back down.
[01:50:33.447 --> 01:50:34.888]  We are not going to submit to tyranny.
[01:50:35.188 --> 01:50:37.430]  We know how real this scientific dictatorship is.
[01:50:38.130 --> 01:50:39.491]  And we know we don't have a choice.
[01:50:40.832 --> 01:50:43.354]  That's why I'm burning the candle at both ends.
[01:50:43.854 --> 01:50:46.456]  We are putting it in high gear, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:46.937 --> 01:50:49.859]  And just never mind those breaks, son.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:52.761]  We got a run to make.
[01:50:53.762 --> 01:50:54.782]  God bless you all.
[01:50:54.822 --> 01:50:55.823]  See you back live tomorrow.
[01:50:55.843 --> 01:50:56.904]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:58.702 --> 01:51:03.729]  I'm taking the blame, I said I'll never give it up
