[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.830]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.130]  Welcome.
[00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.692]  We are at the third hour of this worldwide broadcast on the 15th of January, 2009.
[00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:08.232]  Already into 2009, Bob.
[00:00:08.252 --> 00:00:09.533]  It's pretty incredible.
[00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:09.933]  Time flies.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.080]  Yeah, absolutely does.
[00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:33.961]  As you get older, it gets faster too, Jason.
[00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:34.941]  I got bad news for you.
[00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:36.202]  Well, good thing I'm keeping it young.
[00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:40.783]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv for all you subscribers.
[00:00:41.063 --> 00:00:42.263]  Get to check out the new office.
[00:00:42.603 --> 00:00:44.264]  One of my last days here, it's kind of sad.
[00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:46.864]  You know, this office is just almost too good to leave.
[00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:48.065]  Yeah.
[00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.926]  We are talking monetary policy, and Michael, you had a comment?
[00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:57.067]  I just kind of want to help people out in the way they look at these things.
[00:00:57.107 --> 00:00:57.787]  I think sometimes
[00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.073]  People look at it like, you know, this is how you defeat that.
[00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:03.653]  You know what I mean?
[00:01:03.673 --> 00:01:04.954]  I think we need to look at it differently.
[00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:08.776]  You've got a couple different ways to go about this thing.
[00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:11.357]  You've got hard currency, which is gold and silver.
[00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:16.700]  Or you've got paper fiat, which is issued, let's just say, issued by the Treasury with no interest.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.443]  And then you've got kind of like the Federal Reserve System, which is basically they have their cake and eat it too.
[00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:25.205]  They get to use paper money with no backup.
[00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:28.797]  We're good to go.
[00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:48.584]  They have their corrupt government take all the gold away from the people.
[00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:50.605]  Well, they've had that happen before, man.
[00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:57.550]  I mean, even like in this country, what was it, during World War II, Roosevelt had all the gold rounded up, correct?
[00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.491]  Been there, done that, that was before.
[00:01:58.611 --> 00:01:59.551]  And that's in this country.
[00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:00.512]  That was before World War II.
[00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:01.673]  It was before World War II.
[00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:04.174]  So, listen, your hard assets aren't always safe either.
[00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:10.879]  In fact, I think there's a law that says unless the coin is minted before a certain date in the early 1900s, they can come and take it again, right?
[00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:11.739]  Nothing is safe.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.241]  Oh, they've got a law that's going to prohibit them from stealing certain types of gold.
[00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:18.481]  Oh, there's a law?
[00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:18.921]  Really?
[00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:19.561]  I believe there is.
[00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:22.162]  They're going to, like, obey their own law, right?
[00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:37.864]  And the reason that I go into hard currency, and I don't know if that's the complete answer to the stock market collapse, the financial situation, I'm just saying that gold and silver have retained a value through the centuries, and have always been sought after by not only the wealthy, but the commoner as well.
[00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:40.445]  So it's a good, at least it's something for barter.
[00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:41.385]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:44.406]  I don't think it's going to solve our monetary system.
[00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:52.689]  I would like to see more Ron Paul type policies take place in this country so we do have something to back our money up other than the industry that doesn't exist in this country anymore.
[00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:58.791]  The value of gold and silver is a convention that has worked for centuries and centuries.
[00:02:59.432 --> 00:03:05.954]  And it keeps the money powers from artificially inflating the money supply and hurting everybody's money.
[00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:07.694]  That's the problem we have nowadays.
[00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:08.975]  They just print it out of nothing.
[00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:11.216]  Hey, how are you doing, gentlemen?
[00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:43.356]  I got a problem with my membership, but maybe that can be taken care of when I'm done.
[00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:46.717]  Yeah, we can't do customer service over the phone.
[00:03:46.757 --> 00:03:47.097]  I know that.
[00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:49.878]  I did, but I did want to say something.
[00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.160]  I was listening to the one gentleman.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.142]  He was pretty exasperated about, you know, what do we do?
[00:03:57.222 --> 00:04:01.343]  We hear all this information, and what are we supposed to do with the information?
[00:04:01.363 --> 00:04:07.206]  And I listened to his shows over and over, and it's like,
[00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:08.800]  There's so much going on.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.001]  We're being bombarded from every single angle.
[00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:13.422]  And it's like you jump from one subject to the next.
[00:04:13.902 --> 00:04:24.788]  But I think that, you know, when push comes to shove, when they come to take us out of our houses, that's when you're going to see the real doo-doo hit the fan, so to say.
[00:04:25.328 --> 00:04:27.149]  And that's when the people are going to start fighting back.
[00:04:27.842 --> 00:04:29.763]  Well, I hope that the people fight back before then.
[00:04:29.783 --> 00:04:31.324]  I hope it doesn't come to roundups.
[00:04:31.364 --> 00:04:43.730]  I mean, MTV put out a commercial last year where basically they said that the Holocaust could happen again in this country, and they had people rounded up out of subway stations and out of their homes into trucks.
[00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.251]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:46.271]  We'll be back after this.
[00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:47.212]  Keep taking your calls.
[00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:48.873]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:54.016 --> 00:04:57.058]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.801]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:05:01.281 --> 00:05:07.226]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:11.749]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.953]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:05:18.254 --> 00:05:21.336]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:05:21.656 --> 00:05:23.097]  Run sump pumps, shortwave
[00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:23.517]  We're good.

[00:05:54.145 --> 00:06:06.810]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:17.957]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:21.560]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.481]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:29.265]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:06:55.126 --> 00:06:56.848]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.430]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.632]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:05.865]  Thanks for watching!

[00:07:56.859 --> 00:08:09.605]  Alright folks, we are just busting through your calls here at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:09.645 --> 00:08:11.166]  I am Jason Verma, sitting in all week.
[00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:19.370]  We're going to go to Robert, John, Bob, Jesse, and more.
[00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.409]  But first, I want to play this for the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:34.161]  These are a couple commercials that MTV put out, Think.MTV.com put out last year, and they basically are warning the average Joe that, hey, guess what?
[00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:38.006]  The Holocaust happened to people just like us that didn't really think it was possible.
[00:08:39.127 --> 00:08:39.948]  So let's play the clip.
[00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:02.627]  Don't shoot!
[00:09:40.208 --> 00:09:41.028]  And there you have it.
[00:09:41.909 --> 00:09:48.792]  Now, I know that doesn't make for great radio, because you can't see what's going on, but in the first one, basically, people are rounded up right out of a subway, Bob.
[00:09:49.012 --> 00:09:51.474]  Yeah, and the second one, they're rounded up right out of their house.
[00:09:51.994 --> 00:09:53.375]  And what was waiting for them outside?
[00:09:53.435 --> 00:09:56.716]  Big trucks full of other people from the family.
[00:09:56.736 --> 00:10:02.239]  Which, of course, exactly what Jack McClam has always said, when the tyranny comes, it's wearing a uniform.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.381]  Exactly, and we're going to have McClam on in about 20 minutes.
[00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:05.781]  All right.
[00:10:07.828 --> 00:10:08.808]  Let's take some callers.
[00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:12.149]  Let's go to... Let's see who hasn't hung up on me yet.
[00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:14.890]  I believe Robert in California we just went to, right?
[00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.810]  So we're on... Oh, Robert in California's next.
[00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:17.950]  Good.
[00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.711]  Let's go to Robert in California then.
[00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:20.591]  How you doing, Jason?
[00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:21.151]  Good.
[00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:25.732]  No, I haven't hung up on you, but I'm a little bit pet peeved today.
[00:10:26.232 --> 00:10:26.512]  Okay.
[00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:27.512]  Everybody's mad at me today.
[00:10:27.532 --> 00:10:36.114]  Well, I'm not really mad at you, but, you know, as I keep hearing this over and over again about these large marches, large demonstrations,
[00:10:37.234 --> 00:10:45.956]  You know, that does bring somewhat media attention and put the spotlight on some of the problems.
[00:10:45.996 --> 00:10:52.197]  But the really thing that's really going to change things is if we don't get in there and start grabbing back the handles of government.
[00:10:53.878 --> 00:10:56.198]  We did that here in Los Angeles County.
[00:10:56.878 --> 00:11:00.099]  Several of us who worked on Dr. Paul's campaign
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:18.409]  I mean, he didn't win, but he started an organization that is supposed to get people like ourselves, grassroots, elected into office so that we can make a change.
[00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:24.695]  I think that everybody out there that can run for city council member or a local state senator or a member of Congress should do so.
[00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:29.757]  And that dovetails with the, uh, with G. Edward Griffin's organization, Freedom Force International.
[00:11:29.797 --> 00:11:30.638]  Yes, Freedom Force.
[00:11:30.718 --> 00:11:31.018]  Same thing.
[00:11:31.058 --> 00:11:34.920]  You lost the power incrementally, and now you gotta take it back incrementally.
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.903]  You gotta, you actually, rather than just talk about it and gripe about it, you go out there and you run for dog catcher.
[00:11:40.143 --> 00:11:40.523]  That's right.
[00:11:40.823 --> 00:11:41.763]  Alright, continue, man.
[00:11:42.564 --> 00:11:47.006]  Right, and so, uh, a few of us even got onto the executive board.
[00:11:47.086 --> 00:11:54.690]  Our biggest problem now is basically like any political organization, especially on the Republican side, since they've, um,
[00:11:55.322 --> 00:12:02.104]  Uh, sort of ruin the name is getting people registered as Republicans, getting other Republicans elected and raising money.
[00:12:03.005 --> 00:12:17.390]  Um, uh, of course the big one raising money helps shows that those of us who actually went out and put ourselves into the wheels to, uh, you know, say that we don't really need money from special interests or, or people that we don't necessarily want to be friendly with.
[00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.872]  Um, uh, and then also choosing candidates within your local area.
[00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:30.196]  That's what the Central Committee does, is basically do endorsements and do campaign research and development.
[00:12:30.436 --> 00:12:37.081]  And I think they have these organizations, or what we call them, precinct leaders or block captains, all over the United States.
[00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:49.069]  But until we start grabbing at the bottom and then reaching for the top, we're never going to change the top, because once you take away their base of power and their funding, which is pretty much what we'd like to do,
[00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:51.674]  Nothing's going to happen.
[00:12:51.914 --> 00:12:55.056]  All the marches, all the protests will not help.
[00:12:55.096 --> 00:12:56.436]  Well, I'm with you, man.
[00:12:56.657 --> 00:13:04.840]  First of all, I think that marches do help, but we have not gotten the numbers that we need to make ourselves relevant in the everyday media, number one.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.422]  Number two, I totally and completely agree with you that we need to put ourselves into office.
[00:13:09.062 --> 00:13:13.665]  But then I look at myself, I'm like, am I ready to commit two years of my life into some local office?
[00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:14.585]  Am I ready to do that?
[00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:18.427]  Hopefully somebody else out there is and maybe that's just not my calling, Bob.
[00:13:18.687 --> 00:13:30.694]  But a couple of my friends, upstate New York guys, actually I'm an upstate New York guy, my friends I went to college with, they were from Long Island and they went all the way out to Minnesota for the big Ron Paul rally.
[00:13:31.174 --> 00:13:32.715]  And one of them, one of the two of them,
[00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:38.899]  Actually got chosen by Campaign for Liberty to run for local office and be backed by the organization this year.
[00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:39.860]  I'm not sure if he won.
[00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:44.944]  But it shows how young, you know, he was in his mid-twenties, how young people can get involved, how old people can get involved.
[00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.025]  And I'm with this guy.
[00:13:46.045 --> 00:13:48.306]  I mean, I think that we do have to take back local office.
[00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:51.309]  I think the smaller you start, the bigger you'll get.
[00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:58.836]  Yeah, I don't think that you're going to find many of us able to win a Congressional election or an actual Senate election.
[00:13:59.056 --> 00:14:05.182]  Hell, Cindy Sheehan couldn't even win her Congressional spot and there was enough people out there that didn't want the incumbent Pelosi.
[00:14:05.362 --> 00:14:13.250]  Whether they fudge the numbers or whatever, there was somebody that had a face, a name, and honestly a message that I could get behind, you know, let's end the war.
[00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:20.673]  We're talking about county commissioners and things like that, mayors, you know, that type of thing where they can have an impact on their local community.
[00:14:20.973 --> 00:14:30.338]  Now here in Austin, what, a few years ago, and Alex Jones actually kind of led the thing, we got the city council to pass a resolution against the Patriot Act.
[00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:31.018]  I remember that.
[00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:33.039]  I mean, that's the kind of thing we're talking about.
[00:14:33.719 --> 00:14:42.922]  You gotta go from the bottom up, and it may not be glamorous, you know, to be a county commissioner, I don't know, but things like that have to be done all over the country.
[00:14:42.942 --> 00:14:45.863]  I'm almost sure that it is absolutely not glamorous.
[00:14:45.923 --> 00:14:47.064]  Robert, I thank you for the call.
[00:14:47.564 --> 00:14:49.084]  Alright, let's jump to our next caller.
[00:14:49.124 --> 00:14:50.925]  I believe we are on John in Canada.
[00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:51.725]  John, what's on your mind?
[00:14:51.745 --> 00:14:53.786]  Hey gentlemen, how's it going?
[00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:54.366]  Good.
[00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:55.326]  Good.
[00:14:55.707 --> 00:14:59.168]  Yeah, so I'm going to be a bit of a Christ advocate here.
[00:14:59.208 --> 00:14:59.948]  I want to ask you,
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:07.982]  How much money do we need to give you in charity before you guys understand just the most basic precepts of what justice is?
[00:15:08.642 --> 00:15:13.283]  You know, the problem with you guys hijacking our freedom movement is that you won't acknowledge it.
[00:15:14.463 --> 00:15:17.064]  It's a simple thing.
[00:15:17.104 --> 00:15:19.124]  Look man, we're in the real world.
[00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:22.565]  We don't live in fairy tales and clouds.
[00:15:22.605 --> 00:15:24.025]  Hold on, you need to pay people.
[00:15:24.065 --> 00:15:28.366]  The guy running my show right now across the way, he has to make a living.
[00:15:28.766 --> 00:15:29.246]  You know what I mean?
[00:15:29.266 --> 00:15:30.647]  He has to be able to pay his rent.
[00:15:31.107 --> 00:15:36.550]  I have to be able to pay my rent, my garbage, my electric, somebody to watch my dogs when I'm gone.
[00:15:37.211 --> 00:15:39.812]  I'm not rocking any diamonds in theprisonplanet.tv.
[00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:40.673]  You got this?
[00:15:40.693 --> 00:15:42.854]  This is a metal necklace that cost me $5.
[00:15:43.654 --> 00:15:44.515]  What is his point?
[00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:48.417]  His point is that we're hijacking the free movement because we take money.
[00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:50.158]  Because we take money here.
[00:15:50.238 --> 00:15:50.778]  Is that your point?
[00:15:50.798 --> 00:15:52.279]  Yeah, it's absolutely his point.
[00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:55.060]  Is he still on?
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.502]  Alright, so what's your point?
[00:15:57.802 --> 00:16:00.764]  My point, for example, Ray McGovern, you had him on.
[00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:08.048]  Ray McGovern is fully cognizantly aware that the Bush administration doctored the National Intelligence estimate on invading Iraq.
[00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:14.231]  They took the CIA's words, rewrote entire paragraphs, and conned you as a victim to die.
[00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:15.932]  Now you, as a coward,
[00:16:16.445 --> 00:16:16.786]  I think?
[00:16:32.427 --> 00:16:33.707]  Hold on, I got what I could out of him.
[00:16:33.727 --> 00:16:35.188]  The guy's not even in office yet.
[00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:37.728]  We're five days away from being inaugurated.
[00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:38.428]  Okay?
[00:16:38.729 --> 00:16:40.069]  So what else did you want me to tell you?
[00:16:40.089 --> 00:16:42.149]  He talked about the Bohemian Grove, for Christ's sake.
[00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:44.210]  I also talked about, uh, what else?
[00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.510]  Hold on, what else did I talk to him about?
[00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:50.051]  I also talked to him about that Obama and Hillary attended Bilderberg.
[00:16:50.311 --> 00:16:55.553]  So in a less than hour period, I brought up a lot of good points that were against his point of view.
[00:16:55.773 --> 00:17:00.494]  I don't know if you want me to viciously attack every guest that comes on here, but then we're not going to have guests.
[00:17:00.934 --> 00:17:01.174]  Go ahead.
[00:17:01.647 --> 00:17:01.987]  Not at all.
[00:17:02.047 --> 00:17:05.328]  You know, the other thing you guys got a problem with is putting words in other people's mouths.
[00:17:05.348 --> 00:17:07.168]  It'd be great if I could just speak for myself, you know?
[00:17:07.188 --> 00:17:12.170]  No, you can't speak for yourself when you accuse us of hijacking the freedom movement.
[00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:12.810]  Who is the freedom?
[00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:13.770]  Who the hell are you?
[00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:19.632]  I mean, listen, we're all people and we're not... Your justice?
[00:17:20.132 --> 00:17:23.933]  No, justice requires evidence to prove someone's guilt or innocence.
[00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:28.014]  By Bush closing in 9-11 investigations immediately after the terrorist event,
[00:17:28.385 --> 00:17:32.490]  He's committing the highest act of treason, but you guys go, he's just a puppet, never mind him.
[00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.051]  He is a puppet!
[00:17:34.312 --> 00:17:40.378]  Listen, listen, do you realize yesterday this is something I haven't talked about on the show and you keep screaming, well we're going to let him go because I can't take it.
[00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:44.583]  But it's just totally ridiculous, mentally ill jealousy or something.
[00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:47.166]  The deal is, and I want to see if I can... He is a puppet!
[00:17:47.186 --> 00:17:49.088]  I want to see if I can communicate this to that fellow.
[00:17:49.208 --> 00:17:49.428]  Listen...
[00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.871]  Yes, he is a puppet.
[00:17:51.891 --> 00:17:56.635]  When we say Bush did this and Bush did that, we know that he is a representative.
[00:17:56.675 --> 00:18:01.078]  He is a poster child for a totalitarian oligarchy.
[00:18:01.398 --> 00:18:03.920]  We know that he has no power under himself.
[00:18:04.301 --> 00:18:05.382]  He's being told what to do.
[00:18:05.422 --> 00:18:05.982]  He's a puppet.
[00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:07.323]  So, he's a poster child.
[00:18:07.343 --> 00:18:10.426]  When you say Obama did this or Obama did that, it's not him.
[00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:11.306]  It's his handlers.
[00:18:11.847 --> 00:18:12.868]  It's his controllers.
[00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.751]  We're not supposed to take any money, Bob.
[00:18:15.771 --> 00:18:17.894]  How dare I make a movie and charge for it?
[00:18:17.914 --> 00:18:19.556]  Even though I give it all away for free.
[00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:23.060]  We give it all, this will be on YouTube later today, all for free.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.683]  Well, the money thing, I don't understand.
[00:18:25.703 --> 00:18:26.624]  You know, that's funny.
[00:18:27.345 --> 00:18:32.872]  Dan Rather, when he was head of the CBS News, he could get paid a couple of million dollars a year and he's credible, right?
[00:18:35.268 --> 00:18:39.231]  You know, but these guys, you guys, I know about this operation a little bit.
[00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:42.253]  It's always just by skin of the teeth, all the time, all the time, all the time.
[00:18:42.273 --> 00:18:44.055]  This is the first big expansion they've ever done.
[00:18:44.075 --> 00:18:50.339]  Yeah, I mean, the previous Central Texas Command Center was nothing to... It was about twice the size of this office we're in.
[00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:51.200]  Right, you know, come on.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:58.025]  You have got to, you've got to generate the cash in order to run an operation, and that's just tough.
[00:18:58.645 --> 00:19:19.799]  One thing I love about my show, the simple truth, since it's all volunteer and there is no money involved, there's no commercials, no anything, I'm totally free to say whatever the heck I want and I don't care who I tick off, and I know that when you run a commercial operation, you've got to be careful about, well, you know, you might want to just stay away from this subject because an advertiser might not like it, but that's the real world, man!
[00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:25.002]  If you want to get the information out, you've got to get the information out.
[00:19:25.102 --> 00:19:26.123]  You've got to have a little scratch.
[00:19:26.143 --> 00:19:28.324]  You've got to have some money, and that's just the way it works.
[00:19:28.344 --> 00:19:29.345]  You know, I haven't talked about this.
[00:19:29.365 --> 00:19:30.826]  I'm kind of glad he called in about 9-11.
[00:19:31.306 --> 00:19:37.130]  They just released over a thousand interviews that the 9-11 Commission on their website conducted.
[00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.991]  I didn't see William Rodriguez's name there.
[00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:41.112]  I didn't see Barry Jennings' name either.
[00:19:41.132 --> 00:19:41.933]  What about William Wright?
[00:19:42.573 --> 00:19:44.354]  I don't think I saw Robert Wright's either.
[00:19:45.695 --> 00:19:46.796]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:46.816 --> 00:19:48.397]  The attackers are in full force.
[00:19:48.497 --> 00:19:50.218]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:04.523]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:05.043 --> 00:20:05.564]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:05.844 --> 00:20:06.785]  This is his ammo.
[00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:08.146]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:08.206 --> 00:20:09.867]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:16.953]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:17.354 --> 00:20:17.794]  Some U.S.
[00:20:17.854 --> 00:20:23.479]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:27.720]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:37.924]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:20:38.164 --> 00:20:38.905]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:20:39.385 --> 00:20:46.667]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:47.148 --> 00:20:50.509]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:20:54.787 --> 00:20:58.649]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:59.930]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.652]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:21:03.952 --> 00:21:06.473]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:21:06.873 --> 00:21:08.614]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:11.096]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:21:12.296 --> 00:21:22.742]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:26.724]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:21:26.784 --> 00:21:29.866]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:32.267]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-GOLD.
[00:21:33.508 --> 00:21:36.532]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.021]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:21:55.686 --> 00:21:59.388]  Gentlemen, I know you need no reminder that Valentine's Day is right around the corner.
[00:21:59.748 --> 00:22:01.829]  Obviously, you have the perfect gift in mind.

[00:22:13.435 --> 00:22:18.336]  EnduringRose.com has taken this gift and made it into one that will endure and last forever.

[00:22:41.715 --> 00:22:44.418]  E-N-D-U-R-I-N-G Rose dot com.
[00:22:44.858 --> 00:22:45.219]  Or call 702-453-7455.
[00:22:45.239 --> 00:22:45.559]  That's 702-453-7455.
[00:22:53.738 --> 00:22:57.382]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:22:57.442 --> 00:23:03.087]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:07.231]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:09.813]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:23:09.974 --> 00:23:15.759]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures
[00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:16.419]  We're good to go!
[00:23:33.066 --> 00:23:34.067]  We're good to go.
[00:24:09.277 --> 00:24:10.518]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:10.558 --> 00:24:19.885]  We are live on PrisonPlanet.tv for all those subscribers out there giving us their evil money that helps to fund this program here, Bob.
[00:24:20.005 --> 00:24:21.065]  Yeah, that's just terrible.
[00:24:21.886 --> 00:24:25.549]  It's a horrible thing, Jason, that somebody has enough
[00:24:26.169 --> 00:24:35.097]  Enough desire and enough effort and enough work and enough genius to be able to figure out how to make a successful commercial enterprise out of telling the truth.
[00:24:35.598 --> 00:24:37.460]  You know, what a concept!
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:43.065]  And to infiltrate the biggest, the most uncontrollable source of media out there, the internet.
[00:24:43.265 --> 00:24:43.745]  Yeah, really.
[00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:44.126]  Utilize that.
[00:24:44.466 --> 00:24:44.967]  Absolutely.
[00:24:44.987 --> 00:24:48.813]  I mean, you know, Alex is what, being punished because of his success?
[00:24:48.833 --> 00:24:56.024]  I mean, I'm sure there's some jealousy out there, you know, but look, I admire that I have never seen anybody that works like Alex.
[00:24:56.165 --> 00:24:58.148]  I can't, you know, it's hard to be around Alex.
[00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:00.150]  Oh, yeah.
[00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:34.774]  Yeah, it's a necessity to put out pictures that thousands if not millions of people see.
[00:25:34.974 --> 00:25:35.474]  Exactly!
[00:25:35.774 --> 00:25:39.297]  And to put out a four-hour radio program every day.
[00:25:39.317 --> 00:25:40.178]  Yeah, every day.
[00:25:40.198 --> 00:25:42.499]  A two-hour TV show every day.
[00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:45.001]  I mean, and just so much more.
[00:25:45.041 --> 00:25:50.465]  I mean, to go to events, to write all these articles, to host, I believe, five different websites.
[00:25:50.485 --> 00:25:51.946]  It's the Energizer Bunny, man.
[00:25:53.867 --> 00:25:58.331]  Alright, we're going to take your calls through this segment and then we're going to have Officer Jack McLammon
[00:25:59.215 --> 00:26:01.016]  And then Russell Wood on property taxes.
[00:26:02.537 --> 00:26:03.757]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:26:03.777 --> 00:26:05.758]  It's just like you can never, ever, ever do enough.
[00:26:06.378 --> 00:26:12.521]  Alright, let's just talk 9-11 for a second before we go back to calls because this is important.
[00:26:13.321 --> 00:26:16.463]  This is a lot of information that independent researchers are going to have to go through.
[00:26:16.503 --> 00:26:20.925]  We're talking about people in FEMA being interviewed, people in the CIA.
[00:26:20.965 --> 00:26:23.606]  Like you were saying, you were asking whether or not Robert Wright had been interviewed.
[00:26:23.846 --> 00:26:26.968]  There's an index of all of them and they're all available in PDF format.
[00:26:26.988 --> 00:26:30.369]  I got to scan it over really lightly last night.
[00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:35.952]  If you could look at your archive when we sent you that video of ours when I was talking to the
[00:26:37.037 --> 00:26:39.398]  Chairman of the 9-1-1 Commission back in 2006.
[00:26:40.218 --> 00:26:44.400]  A part that didn't get in your film was my questioning him about Robert Wright.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.221]  I asked him about Robert Wright.
[00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:47.921]  I said, well, you know, Robert Wright went public.
[00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:50.082]  Did you interview Robert Wright?
[00:26:50.102 --> 00:26:51.143]  And he says, well, we might have.
[00:26:51.203 --> 00:26:52.583]  And I said, well, it's not in the report.
[00:26:52.603 --> 00:26:53.584]  And he said, well, he might have been.
[00:26:55.084 --> 00:26:56.444]  He said, well, we interviewed 2,000 people.
[00:26:56.504 --> 00:26:57.745]  I don't know.
[00:26:58.565 --> 00:27:07.647]  And I said, Robert, I was tracking the money from the Islamic charities coming from Saudi Arabia into this country, and the FBI told him to shut up.
[00:27:08.407 --> 00:27:10.988]  And he said, well, it's national security.
[00:27:11.508 --> 00:27:14.749]  They always bring up that national security thing whenever something is inconvenient.
[00:27:14.769 --> 00:27:16.829]  It's the carte blanche answer for none of your goddamn business.
[00:27:16.849 --> 00:27:17.370]  Yeah, shut up.
[00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.930]  Can't go there.
[00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.690]  National security.
[00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:19.370]  National security.
[00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.091]  Alright, let's take Jesse in Wisconsin.
[00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:22.891]  Jesse, what's on your mind?
[00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:25.152]  Hey, I was just calling up.
[00:27:25.212 --> 00:27:26.874]  I've got a couple issues on my mind.
[00:27:27.995 --> 00:27:34.301]  The first one, you're going to be talking with your next guest about taxes and ordinances and things like that going on in cities.
[00:27:34.361 --> 00:27:45.753]  I just found out today on Madison, Wisconsin, there's new zoning rules going on to adapt to climate change as the city of Madison, Wisconsin, has ordinances to adapt to climate change.
[00:27:45.773 --> 00:27:46.854]  That's the title.
[00:27:47.301 --> 00:27:53.502]  I actually went on the City of Madison webpage and the PDF that had all this information is now completely blank.
[00:27:53.522 --> 00:27:54.843]  There's like eight blank pages.
[00:27:54.863 --> 00:27:59.023]  So it's going to be hard for listeners to actually go look at that.
[00:27:59.203 --> 00:28:00.704]  Look for the cached version, man.
[00:28:01.084 --> 00:28:05.165]  If you bring it up into a Google search, you might be able to get lucky and get the cached version.
[00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:07.425]  That's often how I get news stories that they pull.
[00:28:07.465 --> 00:28:07.845]  Continue.
[00:28:08.745 --> 00:28:11.746]  There is a businessandmedia.org has the
[00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:15.720]  Just the news article explaining some of this on there.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.562]  But basically what they want to do, it sounds good on the surface.
[00:28:19.462 --> 00:28:24.265]  For instance, if you cut down a tree on your property, the ordinance will be you have to plant two more.
[00:28:24.325 --> 00:28:29.688]  And that sounds good, but sometimes, you know, you have to take a tree out because it's ruining the sewage lines that lead to the streets and things like that.
[00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.590]  And planting two more trees will just give you the same problem 20 years down the road.
[00:28:37.008 --> 00:28:37.828]  That's conditioning.
[00:28:37.928 --> 00:28:39.169]  It's all just conditioning.
[00:28:39.329 --> 00:28:41.851]  I remember the Planet Tree Foundation when I was a kid.
[00:28:41.891 --> 00:28:49.296]  They make everything out to be the best thing ever, and we're saving the planet, and there's a good feeling we're all going to recycle, blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:49.336 --> 00:28:58.502]  I remember when Clinton was president, he bulldozed a bunch of trees into the Grand Canyon so that the camera view would be better for his saving the environment.
[00:28:58.542 --> 00:28:59.803]  I don't even know if I'm against that.
[00:28:59.823 --> 00:29:01.324]  Alright, thank you so much for the call.
[00:29:02.865 --> 00:29:03.525]  I have another thing.
[00:29:03.765 --> 00:29:07.647]  Aside from this, a lot of people are talking about buying gold and silver these days.
[00:29:07.927 --> 00:29:15.430]  I just let the listeners know and be aware that buying gold and silver is not just as easy as just taking your money down and buying it.
[00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.371]  You should really pay attention to the ratio.
[00:29:17.391 --> 00:29:19.492]  The closer it is to 80 to 1, you'd buy silver.
[00:29:19.532 --> 00:29:21.433]  The closer it is to 40 to 1, you'd buy gold.
[00:29:22.013 --> 00:29:28.456]  That way, you can actually create some wealth out of your own investments on top of the gold and silver actually just being in your savings.
[00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:29.474]  All right, man.
[00:29:29.514 --> 00:29:30.595]  I thank you for the call, Jesse.
[00:29:30.635 --> 00:29:32.136]  I am not a gold expert.
[00:29:32.156 --> 00:29:37.160]  I just know that it's shiny, and it retains value, and it seems to double in value every few years.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.841]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:38.901 --> 00:29:42.343]  I am Jason Burmess, riding shotgun with Bob Dacey.
[00:29:44.104 --> 00:29:45.005]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.485 --> 00:29:47.106]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.047 --> 00:29:50.709]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.962 --> 00:29:56.224]  Right now the world is a scary place.
[00:29:56.444 --> 00:30:01.649]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[00:30:01.889 --> 00:30:06.272]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[00:30:06.473 --> 00:30:09.175]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[00:30:09.355 --> 00:30:19.118]  The first line of defense kit includes Nutri-Immune and Nutri-Defense, providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry, and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[00:30:19.338 --> 00:30:24.300]  Also included, the Nano-Mask Nano-Particular Antiviral Masks with replacement filters.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.000]  We're good to go.
[00:30:55.151 --> 00:30:58.333]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[00:30:58.353 --> 00:31:00.915]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:31:00.935 --> 00:31:02.136]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:31:02.196 --> 00:31:03.757]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:31:03.877 --> 00:31:06.700]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.382]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:26.070]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.351]  An inside job?
[00:31:28.712 --> 00:31:30.314]  How dare you?
[00:31:31.154 --> 00:31:36.219]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:38.561]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:45.305]  Truth Rising.

[00:31:58.302 --> 00:32:00.643]  Are you tired of feeling restless from insomnia?
[00:32:00.983 --> 00:32:08.025]  These symptoms are produced by negative toxins, but with the correct information, understanding, and care, you can cleanse them from your body.

[00:33:11.966 --> 00:33:13.548]  Alright, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:20.498]  We are back with Bob Dacey Riding Shotgun and hopefully we've got Officer Jack McLam on the line.
[00:33:20.538 --> 00:33:22.441]  He does another great program here at GCN.
[00:33:24.383 --> 00:33:27.785]  And we've had a lot of people in an uproar over the gun issue today.
[00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:32.448]  So what better guest to have on other than Officer Jack McClam.
[00:33:32.849 --> 00:33:46.898]  One of the guys that really was on the front lines of educating not only the populace, but like you said, the police and military about the New World Order, global government, and why it's so important to keep our Second Amendment and have well-organized militias.
[00:33:46.938 --> 00:33:47.938]  Mr. McClam, are you with us?
[00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:51.441]  I'm here, Brother Jason and Bob.
[00:33:51.701 --> 00:33:53.062]  Good to be back on with you.
[00:33:54.326 --> 00:33:58.628]  Well, why don't you just give the listeners just a little summation of who you are and where they can get your information.
[00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:15.216]  Well, I'm in my 29th year as a volunteer educating our police and soldiers, and I have a website of one of our associations, Police and Military Against the New World Order.
[00:34:17.197 --> 00:34:20.078]  You find that very easily by going to www.
[00:34:22.634 --> 00:34:31.799]  Jack McLamb, and it's spelled M-C, capital L-A-M-B, just like a lamb, mclamb.org.
[00:34:33.399 --> 00:34:34.680]  Jackmclamb.org.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.822]  And you'll find all of my qualifications there.
[00:34:40.063 --> 00:34:44.105]  I was the most highly decorated police officer in the history of Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:34:44.965 --> 00:34:50.568]  And after I became a constitutionalist and started serving the people instead of serving the city,
[00:34:51.514 --> 00:34:54.756]  I became the most fired officer in the history of Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:34:55.256 --> 00:35:04.280]  And so I started writing my police and military publication, Aid in a Bet, police military newsletter on constitutional issues.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:11.223]  And that really ticked them off because they didn't want our police and military to even be thinking about the Constitution.
[00:35:12.283 --> 00:35:17.786]  They just want them to follow their corrupt orders and do what they're told to do.
[00:35:18.977 --> 00:35:26.443]  And I took issue with that because I saw firsthand how we were committing crimes.
[00:35:26.583 --> 00:35:34.149]  We police officers were committing crimes in supposedly to arrest the criminals.
[00:35:34.749 --> 00:35:37.351]  We would have to become criminals to arrest the criminals.
[00:35:38.212 --> 00:35:41.895]  And that offended me as a Christian police officer.
[00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:46.659]  And so after taking so much of that for about three years,
[00:35:47.543 --> 00:36:06.961]  I became the most highly decorated officer in Phoenix, Arizona history and then I began to change after I had a man about 85, 90 years old upset me because I didn't know the Constitution.
[00:36:10.613 --> 00:36:23.279]  Uh, speech I was giving out at Sun City, Arizona for senior citizens on how they could protect themselves from muggings and rapes and house break-ins and so forth.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.123]  They were undergoing quite a serious attack as they'd cash their social security checks.
[00:36:30.223 --> 00:36:34.445]  They would be attacked and have it taken away from them.
[00:36:34.805 --> 00:36:37.086]  So they invited me out to speak and, uh,
[00:36:39.057 --> 00:36:48.382]  85, 90-year-old man embarrassed me to tears almost there as he began to say, didn't you swear an oath to the Constitution of the United States?
[00:36:48.462 --> 00:36:50.223]  And I said, well, certainly I did.
[00:36:51.904 --> 00:36:55.846]  Or to the Constitution and the people and so forth.
[00:36:55.926 --> 00:36:56.907]  I said, yes, I did.
[00:36:57.507 --> 00:36:59.789]  I did it when I was in during the Vietnam War.
[00:37:00.629 --> 00:37:04.291]  Took that oath and then I took the oath when I became a police officer.
[00:37:05.211 --> 00:37:09.592]  And he began to question me about the Constitution, and I didn't have any answers for him.
[00:37:09.632 --> 00:37:13.114]  Like, what is the Sixth Amendment to the Bill of Rights?
[00:37:13.754 --> 00:37:15.474]  And, you know, so forth and so on.
[00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:17.975]  And he just embarrassed me to pieces.
[00:37:19.516 --> 00:37:21.896]  And I hated that man at that time.
[00:37:22.337 --> 00:37:23.617]  I mean, I really hated him.
[00:37:24.097 --> 00:37:29.519]  And I went home that night feeling that I could go out underneath the door with it closed.
[00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:31.940]  I was so low and so upset.
[00:37:35.031 --> 00:37:40.574]  But after about two weeks of not sleeping at night, God was working on me, brother.
[00:37:42.134 --> 00:37:49.598]  And so finally, I sat up in the middle of the bed one night and realized that that little old 85, 90-year-old man was right.
[00:37:49.658 --> 00:37:55.101]  I should have known the Constitution and the Bill of Rights that I had sworn to protect.
[00:37:56.061 --> 00:38:03.765]  And so I went right down to the library, and the city library had trouble finding a Constitution and Bill of Rights for me.
[00:38:04.702 --> 00:38:25.454]  But they finally found it, and I took it home and studied it, and then joined a constitutional group in Mesa, Arizona, where I was quite shocked that when I got there at this meeting, I didn't know it was a tax protest meeting, and I was
[00:38:28.268 --> 00:38:32.489]  Everybody, you went around the room and told who you are and what you do for a living.
[00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:49.735]  So when they got to me, I told them I was a Finnish police officer and the position I served in and everybody really got quiet, you know, and that night when I left, they all walked me out to the car and waved to me, waved goodbye.
[00:38:51.376 --> 00:38:56.938]  Well, I continue to go to these constitutional training meetings for several weeks and then
[00:38:57.677 --> 00:39:05.679]  The leader told me, he says, the reason we walked you out of their car that night was so you wouldn't copy down our license plate numbers when you left.
[00:39:05.699 --> 00:39:07.780]  I said, oh, okay.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:18.323]  And so we became good friends after several months of me attending the meetings and really being earnestly seeking to learn about my constitutional oath.
[00:39:19.063 --> 00:39:27.186]  So when I came back to the police department, I started asking my sergeant and my captain
[00:39:27.874 --> 00:39:41.641]  And on up through the chain of command if they knew what was in the Constitution, because we were regularly violating our constitutional oath, and I didn't know that until I studied it, you know?
[00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:46.383]  And then I realized that we're violating our oath all the time.
[00:39:47.003 --> 00:39:52.166]  And of course, the officers didn't know what their oath pertained of, like me.
[00:39:53.973 --> 00:40:17.319]  So I started my newsletter, Constitutional Issues for Lawmen and Soldiers, and boy, that blew a hole in my career, because they liked soldiers and police not knowing about the Constitution, and so they could be told to do things that were criminal in a violation of their constitutional oath, and they'd do it, because they didn't know about it.
[00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:22.260]  So I was set out to change that, and so then I
[00:40:23.274 --> 00:40:27.996]  I was fired repeatedly for my constitutional work.
[00:40:28.597 --> 00:40:34.559]  But the neat thing about it was, I had a very liberal civil service board in the city of Phoenix.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:43.363]  And when a police officer was fired, he could go before the civil service board, or she, and state their case.
[00:40:43.724 --> 00:40:52.968]  And in each case, when I would go in and tell them about my constitutional writings to my fellow police officers, they would return me to work with full back pay.
[00:40:53.692 --> 00:40:58.773]  So you can't fire a man for what he believes and what he says.
[00:41:01.054 --> 00:41:12.016]  And they, the very liberal civil service board said they didn't agree with anything I wrote in my constitutional publication, but they realized I had a right to write it to my fellow officers.
[00:41:12.076 --> 00:41:13.797]  So they returned me to work each time.
[00:41:15.457 --> 00:41:18.418]  And then my chief decided to try to get me killed.
[00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.952]  You know, because he couldn't get rid of me any other time.
[00:41:22.452 --> 00:41:31.457]  And he had state police, uh, federal police getting ahold of him, telling him to stop McGlam for writing this constitutional publication.
[00:41:32.478 --> 00:41:47.647]  So he decided on a plan, he put me out in the high crime area of South Phoenix, the war zone of South Phoenix, we call it, where I always did work, but they put me out on midnights and told all the, all the police officers,
[00:41:48.328 --> 00:41:51.730]  Twenty-five hundred of us that not to go.
[00:41:52.311 --> 00:41:55.593]  If McGilliam calls for a backup, don't go to aid him.
[00:41:55.873 --> 00:41:56.453]  Don't go.
[00:41:56.654 --> 00:41:59.175]  If he calls for a backup, do not go and help him.
[00:41:59.936 --> 00:42:01.777]  So the chief was trying to get me killed.
[00:42:01.797 --> 00:42:05.399]  Of course, my chief of police, Ruben Ortega, was a murderer anyway.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:12.124]  He had murdered a man and got away with it because he was chief of police, but he was going to murder me, you know?
[00:42:12.644 --> 00:42:15.086]  So it was tough for the next five years.
[00:42:15.206 --> 00:42:16.547]  I worked without a backup.
[00:42:17.097 --> 00:42:20.658]  In the war zone of South Phoenix and got injured numerous times.
[00:42:21.578 --> 00:42:30.181]  And finally, the civil city doctors realized that Ruben Ortega, the chief, was trying to get me killed because they kept patching me up.
[00:42:30.761 --> 00:42:41.764]  And so I arrested a drug smuggler, illegal alien out of Mexico one morning, Sunday morning, and we got in a big fight that lasted almost an hour.
[00:42:42.485 --> 00:42:43.765]  And, uh, uh,
[00:42:44.341 --> 00:42:56.685]  Nobody would come as a backup for me and so finally it ended up I was so injured with my neck and back and shoulder that all I could do was hold on to this guy's foot.
[00:42:57.525 --> 00:43:01.906]  I had an arm lock on his foot and he couldn't get away.
[00:43:02.507 --> 00:43:09.689]  So finally he was dragging me down the street and another officer drove by and saw me and he stopped and helped me.
[00:43:10.429 --> 00:43:13.290]  He wasn't supposed to but he did and we got him under arrest.
[00:43:14.372 --> 00:43:21.497]  And so when I went to the city doctors that time, they told me that they were not going to release me to go back to work.
[00:43:21.517 --> 00:43:22.998]  They were going to retire me out.
[00:43:23.919 --> 00:43:35.548]  And so my very evil police chief, Ruben Ortega, fought my retirement, didn't want to give me any retirement pay at all, even though I was disabled.
[00:43:36.448 --> 00:43:41.032]  And so it was a battle, but I finally retired out with a small pension.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:50.566]  I've been doing this work now for 29 years of trying to educate our police and soldiers to try to get them to realize that they have an oath.
[00:43:54.204 --> 00:43:56.926]  responsibility to the people, not to the city.
[00:43:57.386 --> 00:43:58.967]  Jack, this is Bob Dacey.
[00:43:59.008 --> 00:44:01.329]  I wanted to ask you something here.
[00:44:01.689 --> 00:44:03.551]  I've never had the pleasure of meeting you in person.
[00:44:03.571 --> 00:44:05.832]  I would love to do that because I really admire what you do.
[00:44:06.533 --> 00:44:07.554]  Thank you, Brother Bob.
[00:44:07.994 --> 00:44:09.335]  You take it right to the bottom line.
[00:44:09.355 --> 00:44:12.517]  You always say that if tyranny comes, it's going to be wearing a uniform.
[00:44:12.777 --> 00:44:13.378]  That's right.
[00:44:13.558 --> 00:44:19.502]  And your whole thing is to wake up the police and the military as to what their oath really means to the Constitution.
[00:44:19.963 --> 00:44:22.364]  I know you had that Operation Vampire Killer 2000
[00:44:23.545 --> 00:44:26.189]  I read that thing and everything in it is just right on.
[00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:28.111]  I want to ask you this question.
[00:44:28.151 --> 00:44:32.657]  This is kind of a down to earth question in terms of what a beat cop experiences.
[00:44:33.218 --> 00:44:37.183]  Because in Austin we're having some problems, constitutional problems with certain things.
[00:44:37.844 --> 00:44:40.027]  How does a beat cop overcome
[00:44:41.073 --> 00:44:55.700]  the defense of necessity where where his superiors say well guys we just gotta do this you know we have we have to do this particular procedure because we just have to just to save the children or keep the baby safe or whatever.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.822]  How does a cop defend against that when what he's being told to do is illegal?
[00:45:00.602 --> 00:45:10.167]  Well luckily I got into law enforcement in 1976 and at that time we had a nightstick, a gun
[00:45:11.053 --> 00:45:11.113]  I'm
[00:45:35.097 --> 00:45:43.811]  The call for a backup, so usually we would win, but I did lose seven of my brother officers during the years I was on the force.
[00:45:44.488 --> 00:45:46.548]  They're in the war zone of South Phoenix.
[00:45:46.968 --> 00:45:55.610]  I'm talking about when the powers that be in the police department want their cops to do something which is constitutionally questionable.
[00:45:55.630 --> 00:46:00.311]  Like for example, here in Austin we're having this big dispute about what we call vampire cops.
[00:46:01.011 --> 00:46:11.873]  Where they pull somebody over for driving while intoxicated and when he uses his Fifth Amendment to not cooperate, they forcibly take blood from him.
[00:46:12.723 --> 00:46:19.230]  And do you have a position on that particular issue, the vampire cop versus the Fifth Amendment?
[00:46:19.731 --> 00:46:30.082]  Well, it is totally within the purview of the Constitution that a person say no to giving evidence
[00:46:31.643 --> 00:46:33.265]  To convict them, even blood.
[00:46:33.725 --> 00:46:36.587]  Yeah, but the cops nowadays say, yeah, but we just have to.
[00:46:37.148 --> 00:46:38.569]  Well, somebody.
[00:46:38.609 --> 00:46:39.369]  Yeah.
[00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.532]  They don't know anything about the constitution.
[00:46:42.732 --> 00:46:43.793]  That's the sad thing.
[00:46:44.193 --> 00:46:45.594]  The new cops coming on.
[00:46:45.654 --> 00:46:54.101]  Matter of fact, they're, they're hiring cops after I went through and they finally got rid of me through retirement.
[00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:56.703]  They changed the hiring practices.
[00:46:57.338 --> 00:47:03.841]  That no more would they hire a Christian cop with a high moral value, with high moral values.
[00:47:04.281 --> 00:47:18.907]  They just wouldn't do it because I was not, and I convinced other Christian police officers and other police officers not to do anything criminal because it is not what we should do to get a person into jail.
[00:47:19.867 --> 00:47:21.928]  And so I was there on the scene.
[00:47:23.234 --> 00:47:52.863]  Many times, like one night, some officers stopped a patriot, and the patriot knew questions to ask and comments to say, and so he called for a backup, and I appeared on the scene with some other officers there, and he had a gun on the front seat that was out in the open, and so to punish him, the officers decided that they would say that his coat was over the gun,
[00:47:53.715 --> 00:47:57.497]  And booking for a felony for having a concealed weapon in the vehicle.
[00:47:57.757 --> 00:47:59.458]  And I said, no, you're not going to do that.
[00:47:59.618 --> 00:48:03.700]  If you do, I'm going to tell, you know, and so they didn't do it.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:22.229]  But another thing we started doing in the city of Phoenix is that if we had somebody we didn't like, like a patriot, a Christian or a patriot that would ask us questions that we couldn't answer about the constitution or something, then we would fall down and scream.
[00:48:23.214 --> 00:48:24.976]  And say, he pushed me, he pushed me.
[00:48:25.356 --> 00:48:31.040]  And so we would turn a misdemeanor stop into a felony against the person.
[00:48:31.621 --> 00:48:35.624]  And of course, he didn't push you, but it would become a felony.
[00:48:36.365 --> 00:48:46.453]  So I would reject that and tell the officers in my newsletter about, don't do this because you become a criminal just like the criminals we're trying to arrest, you know?
[00:48:47.294 --> 00:48:48.737]  And so, you're right.
[00:48:49.278 --> 00:48:53.228]  Today, it's even more so that we commit crimes.
[00:48:53.328 --> 00:48:56.316]  We get on the witness stand and lie against somebody.
[00:48:57.675 --> 00:49:08.782]  And talk about procedural things, like for example, we have new technology now that wasn't available during the time the Constitution was written, and the Bill of Rights was written.
[00:49:09.522 --> 00:49:18.628]  The Fifth Amendment says you cannot search somebody's houses or papers or personal effects without reasonable cause, going to a judge and getting a warrant.
[00:49:19.408 --> 00:49:24.331]  And it describes the things to be seized and all that stuff.
[00:49:25.352 --> 00:49:38.599]  But now, I'm playing devil's advocate here now, now we have technology where the evidence of the crime is in your body, in terms of say, driving while intoxicated, and they want that evidence.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.562]  And so, it's not in your house anymore, the evidence, it's in your body.
[00:49:44.315 --> 00:49:54.577]  And so, herefore, what's supposedly legal is they take you downtown to a medical facility if you refuse to cooperate and forcibly draw your blood.
[00:49:55.337 --> 00:50:03.198]  Well, that's totally unconstitutional, as you know, but they don't go by the Constitution anymore because it restricts them too much.
[00:50:03.258 --> 00:50:12.340]  We're going into a totalitarian state here in this country and they don't want to use the Constitution and don't want you to use the Constitution anymore.
[00:50:13.188 --> 00:50:16.450]  But that is totally unconstitutional for them to make.
[00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:22.795]  You should be able to decide if you want to give blood or if you want to do the breathalyzer test.
[00:50:23.315 --> 00:50:26.197]  And it used to be where you could make that decision.
[00:50:26.257 --> 00:50:31.421]  Now, they could fine you by taking your license away for a couple years and so forth.
[00:50:32.042 --> 00:50:33.663]  There wasn't much you could do about that.
[00:50:33.763 --> 00:50:37.145]  But you did have a right to say no to those kind of tests.
[00:50:37.245 --> 00:50:37.726]  But now,
[00:50:38.527 --> 00:50:41.890]  If they've thrown the Constitution out, they do whatever they want.
[00:50:42.251 --> 00:50:43.392]  Alright, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:43.412 --> 00:50:44.193]  We'll be back after this.
[00:50:44.253 --> 00:50:45.354]  Infowars.com.
[00:50:54.139 --> 00:50:58.422]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:50:58.662 --> 00:51:03.564]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:51:03.745 --> 00:51:05.085]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:05.265 --> 00:51:08.747]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:51:54.076 --> 00:52:00.402]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:00.762 --> 00:52:02.424]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:03.399 --> 00:52:04.400]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:05.441]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:05.741 --> 00:52:06.722]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:06.743 --> 00:52:08.044]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:08.084 --> 00:52:09.746]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:10.106 --> 00:52:16.853]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:17.253 --> 00:52:17.694]  Some U.S.
[00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:23.380]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.582]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:27.602 --> 00:52:29.563]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:53.792 --> 00:52:58.394]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:52:58.715 --> 00:53:05.898]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:53:06.159 --> 00:53:07.539]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:53:07.779 --> 00:53:11.661]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:15.503]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:53:15.764 --> 00:53:19.846]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:53:20.226 --> 00:53:22.187]  Phase One is a One World Currency.
[00:53:22.347 --> 00:53:24.229]  Which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:28.332]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:32.955]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[00:53:33.355 --> 00:53:36.878]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com.

[00:54:03.765 --> 00:54:04.906]  Alright, folks, we are back.
[00:54:04.926 --> 00:54:06.666]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:06.826 --> 00:54:08.987]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in all week for Alex.
[00:54:09.667 --> 00:54:14.368]  Bob Dacey, Riding Shotgun, and we're with Jack McLam, who's really been at this almost 30 years.
[00:54:14.388 --> 00:54:19.549]  Folks, before the internet, there were people like Jack McLam that would actually, they'd make a newsletter.
[00:54:19.769 --> 00:54:27.211]  Isn't that, it's like, it's so bizarre to hear people that, but there were people before Alex Jones, there will be people after Alex Jones, and, you know,
[00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:30.893]  Jack is one of those guys that took the technology at the time to the next level.
[00:54:30.913 --> 00:54:42.479]  You know, as I described in the first segment in the beginning of the show, often when I go through a lot of these news clips and they're giving the anti-side to global government or the new world order, they're interviewing Jack McLam.
[00:54:42.519 --> 00:54:50.283]  So, it's just a great privilege to have you on the program and it's a great privilege to have you out here waking up even more military police and even just common listeners.
[00:54:50.908 --> 00:54:51.628]  Thank you, brother.
[00:54:51.648 --> 00:54:59.633]  Yeah, for those listeners out there that don't know, I'm a military veteran and had a top secret clearance during the Vietnam War.
[00:55:00.113 --> 00:55:08.077]  And so I do communicate very well with my fellow soldiers out there, too, about their constitutional oath and everything.
[00:55:08.823 --> 00:55:13.065]  Speaking of the constitutional oath, Jack, this is something that happened to me four years ago.
[00:55:13.085 --> 00:55:24.891]  I was interviewing here locally in Austin a sheriff's candidate, running for sheriff, county sheriff, and I asked him the question, I asked him if he would swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and he said, absolutely.
[00:55:25.351 --> 00:55:28.933]  I asked him if the Bill of Rights was part of the Constitution, and he said, oh, of course.
[00:55:29.574 --> 00:55:31.555]  And then I asked him if the Fourth Amendment
[00:55:32.876 --> 00:55:33.356]  That's right.
[00:55:33.376 --> 00:55:34.137]  That's right.
[00:55:34.157 --> 00:55:36.758]  We're taught in the city departments that the feds are our superiors.
[00:56:01.915 --> 00:56:07.899]  When they come to town, we whine and dine them and give them the keys to the city, which is absolutely absurd.
[00:56:08.419 --> 00:56:13.863]  We swore to protect the Constitution and the people, not the city or not the federal government.
[00:56:32.775 --> 00:56:33.195]  Oh brother.
[00:56:33.215 --> 00:56:36.136]  So basically, and this guy is the Travis County Sheriff right now.
[00:56:36.256 --> 00:56:37.677]  Boy, that's a shame.
[00:56:38.117 --> 00:56:39.997]  That's a shame because he's so wrong.
[00:56:40.397 --> 00:56:51.700]  I know, and it's kind of, it's pathetic, but the problem is, and you identify it, they swear an oath to protect and defend a document they haven't read and don't understand.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:52.700]  That's right.
[00:56:53.181 --> 00:56:53.681]  That's right.
[00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:58.702]  I had to go out and take a year of training from a very
[00:56:59.566 --> 00:57:08.992]  Uh, good organization there in Mace, Arizona to learn all about my oath and all about the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and what I swore to.
[00:57:09.352 --> 00:57:12.173]  And we don't give them any training like that.
[00:57:12.294 --> 00:57:14.735]  We have them take the oath and then tell them to forget it.
[00:57:15.075 --> 00:57:16.516]  Well, that's what you're here for, right?
[00:57:16.556 --> 00:57:17.637]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:57:17.817 --> 00:57:20.438]  I wonder how successful do you think you've been over all these years?
[00:57:20.478 --> 00:57:27.122]  How many cops and military personnel actually you think understand the Constitution, understand the Bill of Rights, understand the oath?
[00:57:29.324 --> 00:57:33.187]  Most of them are retired now, except the ones we're reaching today.
[00:57:34.127 --> 00:57:44.675]  We're reaching more today, but we've been at it 29 years as volunteers here, and a lot of them have retired out.
[00:57:46.376 --> 00:57:49.038]  Like the Vampire Killer 2000, we've got like 2,500,000 copies out there.
[00:57:55.814 --> 00:57:58.617]  It's done an absolutely fantastic job.
[00:57:59.798 --> 00:58:09.127]  We get officers and soldiers that contact us, even retired ones who had read the Operation Vampire Killer 2000.
[00:58:09.747 --> 00:58:15.573]  And some were thrown out of office as police officers and soldiers because they read it, too.
[00:58:16.664 --> 00:58:24.071]  Anytime you're trying to hand out information about the Constitution and Bill of Rights being really the only authority in this country, you're gone after.
[00:58:24.391 --> 00:58:25.172]  It's unfortunate.
[00:58:25.192 --> 00:58:26.333]  We thank you so much for joining us.
[00:58:26.593 --> 00:58:28.595]  We'll have Russell Wood at the top of the hour.
[00:58:28.695 --> 00:58:30.317]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:30.377 --> 00:58:32.679]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:32.719 --> 00:58:35.342]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:43.746 --> 00:58:45.307]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:45.427 --> 00:58:50.088]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:50.168 --> 00:58:52.929]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:55.990]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:58:56.190 --> 00:59:00.892]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:01.132 --> 00:59:02.073]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:02.254 --> 00:59:05.198]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:05.498 --> 00:59:12.408]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:12.528 --> 00:59:15.632]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:15.772 --> 00:59:16.033]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:18.436 --> 00:59:20.677]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:20.917 --> 00:59:26.980]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.921]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:30.941 --> 00:59:32.302]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:32.322 --> 00:59:32.882]  Take action today.
[00:59:32.922 --> 00:59:34.743]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:46.403 --> 00:59:48.326]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.806 --> 00:59:51.610]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.961]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:10.841]  I get pumped every time I hear this music.
[01:00:10.921 --> 01:00:11.922]  It's just like, yeah!
[01:00:12.922 --> 01:00:14.042]  Taking on the Empire.
[01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:15.923]  Alex always has the coolest music.
[01:00:16.003 --> 01:00:16.643]  It's not fair.
[01:00:17.003 --> 01:00:18.464]  He does have the coolest music.
[01:00:18.504 --> 01:00:18.884]  You're right.
[01:00:18.924 --> 01:00:22.045]  This is some cool music.
[01:00:22.725 --> 01:00:25.186]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in for Alex all week.
[01:00:25.926 --> 01:00:27.047]  Folks, please support us.
[01:00:27.587 --> 01:00:34.849]  Don't listen to that ridiculous caller about an hour ago saying that we're, you know, taking all this money and doing God knows what with it.
[01:00:34.869 --> 01:00:35.650]  I don't have a yacht.
[01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.152]  I ain't rockin' diamonds, there's no gold around my neck.
[01:00:39.913 --> 01:00:43.355]  We need your, uh, support, so we can make more videos.
[01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:46.377]  We can do a four-hour radio show a day.
[01:00:46.978 --> 01:00:49.139]  You know, I can do a two-hour weekend program.
[01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:54.143]  I mean, Alex is on the air for 22 hours, at least, and that's when he doesn't go into overdrive, a week.
[01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.484]  And that's on air.
[01:00:55.504 --> 01:00:58.727]  Do you know how much preparation it takes to do a four-hour radio show?
[01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:01.289]  I gotta get here an hour early just so I can go over the news.
[01:01:01.969 --> 01:01:02.709]  It's unbelievable.
[01:01:02.989 --> 01:01:07.610]  We're riding shotgun with Bob Dacey, of course, of TheSimpleTruthOnline.net.
[01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:16.252]  And we're about to welcome our guest, C. Russell Wood, who is a farmer from Missouri Arks and the President of Property Rights Congress.
[01:01:16.712 --> 01:01:26.194]  He and his organization have protested against the NAIS premise for IDs against hunting licenses on privately owned property along with other property rights issues.
[01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:27.414]  Thanks for joining us, Russell.
[01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:29.375]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[01:01:30.165 --> 01:01:35.488]  Why don't you give the viewers just a brief synopsis of who you are and what this is all about.
[01:01:36.169 --> 01:01:36.609]  Okay.
[01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:42.233]  We're a group of property owners here in Missouri, basically.
[01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:48.577]  We look out for the interests of private property rights.
[01:01:48.637 --> 01:01:58.283]  We try to ward off the never-ending infringement by non-governmental organizations as well as governmental organizations.
[01:01:59.204 --> 01:01:59.704]  Our latest
[01:02:00.854 --> 01:02:05.257]  The battle here is dealing with the Missouri Department of Conservation.
[01:02:05.277 --> 01:02:23.691]  It was on the program about a month ago, and the situation then was that they were proposing several rate increases, but the thing that affected us most was their plan, their request.
[01:02:24.911 --> 01:02:29.655]  They currently permit no charge
[01:02:30.387 --> 01:02:32.269]  We're good to go.
[01:02:59.403 --> 01:03:09.127]  The legal description of your property into this property registry that would be for the Missouri Department of Conservation.
[01:03:09.968 --> 01:03:22.253]  They withdrew virtually all of their requests for change except the property registration part.
[01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:28.796]  That they are still hanging on to, but they did back off the implementation date.
[01:03:30.851 --> 01:03:34.394]  Four or six months, and they changed the rhetoric.
[01:03:35.214 --> 01:03:36.995]  They softened the rhetoric.
[01:03:38.096 --> 01:03:47.223]  Before the comment period, which ran back in December, before that they were telling us how it was going to be.
[01:03:48.784 --> 01:03:58.030]  After they received, now these are their numbers, I don't know how accurate they are, but the numbers they put out was that they received 17,000
[01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:06.346]  Comment from 10,000 people in a 30-day period.
[01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:23.631]  Our organization, our Ozark Property Rights Congress Group, we submitted the letter to the Director of the Missouri Department of Conservation, explaining to them what we would do as property owners.
[01:04:24.532 --> 01:04:31.154]  That we would not buy their permits, that we would post our property and not allow hunting
[01:04:32.485 --> 01:04:37.911]  Um, with those who had permits and so forth, and that we weren't going to register our property.
[01:04:38.571 --> 01:04:40.493]  Alright, we'll be coming back right after this, Russell.
[01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:43.757]  It's the Alex Jones Show, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:54.179 --> 01:04:57.442]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:04:57.622 --> 01:05:01.686]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:05:01.866 --> 01:05:09.834]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:13.296]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:05:13.516 --> 01:05:19.398]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:05:19.659 --> 01:05:24.021]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:32.325]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:05:32.525 --> 01:05:39.368]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare and
[01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:47.466]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:47.726 --> 01:05:49.107]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:03.365 --> 01:06:04.386]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:04.907 --> 01:06:05.407]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:05.707 --> 01:06:06.688]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:06.709 --> 01:06:08.050]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:09.712]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:10.072 --> 01:06:16.819]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:17.219 --> 01:06:17.660]  Some U.S.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:23.346]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:27.529]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:30.591]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:06:54.226 --> 01:06:57.067]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[01:06:57.567 --> 01:07:04.751]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[01:07:05.311 --> 01:07:12.554]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[01:07:13.134 --> 01:07:19.397]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:26.533]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[01:07:26.813 --> 01:07:29.115]  Beware, be smart and be ready!
[01:07:29.615 --> 01:07:35.439]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org.
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:41.823]  Families need this high quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:45.886]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[01:07:46.286 --> 01:07:46.587]  Call 908-691-2608
[01:07:48.123 --> 01:07:52.647]  691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[01:07:58.551 --> 01:07:59.212]  Big Brother.
[01:07:59.872 --> 01:08:00.933]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:01.633 --> 01:08:02.734]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:03.395 --> 01:08:04.195]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.976 --> 01:08:06.437]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:06.537 --> 01:08:10.460]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.743]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.346 --> 01:08:18.151]  We are back with Russell Wood.
[01:08:19.113 --> 01:08:22.141]  And Russell, I just want to see if I've gotten all the information correctly.
[01:08:23.171 --> 01:08:27.314]  First of all, they want you to get a permit to hunt on your own land.
[01:08:28.014 --> 01:08:31.757]  And it used to be that if you owned 10 acres, you didn't need this permit.
[01:08:31.797 --> 01:08:35.840]  But now you have to own up to 80 acres to be without this permit.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:41.323]  Secondly, when you do get this permit, they also want you to give a record of all of your property.
[01:08:41.964 --> 01:08:48.568]  And then the third thing, I'm not quite sure if I got this right, but they're going to allow other people who have permits to hunt on your privately owned land?
[01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:52.611]  That is the landowner's prerogative.
[01:08:53.534 --> 01:09:03.857]  Um, what we as landowners are, are wanting to do is, um, just post our property for no hunting until this whole matter is resolved.
[01:09:04.778 --> 01:09:09.879]  Now, the part about the, um, the acreage limitations, they've dropped that.
[01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:19.282]  Uh, if you own at least five acres, they will give you a, a, a no cost, a free permit.
[01:09:20.062 --> 01:09:22.203]  But you know, there's something about these permits.
[01:09:23.437 --> 01:09:24.638]  Uh, they want you to have one.
[01:09:24.678 --> 01:09:25.679]  They won't charge you for it.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.582]  But when you get these permits, you sign them.
[01:09:31.083 --> 01:09:41.392]  And when you do this, as is with so many other things that you're asked to sign, it'll say, by signing this, you agree to, and blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:42.332 --> 01:09:47.416]  And therein, you give away, quite often, so many of your rights.
[01:09:47.476 --> 01:09:50.599]  And there's a big question as to what authority
[01:09:51.792 --> 01:09:52.313]  I don't know.
[01:10:08.587 --> 01:10:16.749]  Which means you're turning over your authority to the state, whereas you're a sovereign individual and it's your property and you should be able to do whatever you like on it.
[01:10:16.769 --> 01:10:21.890]  You shouldn't have to beg for permission and then put yourself under the legislation of somebody else.
[01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.210]  Bob?
[01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:23.971]  Russell, this is Bob Nacy.
[01:10:24.551 --> 01:10:30.232]  I'm trying to understand, you know when they come up with stuff like this, they always have some ostensible reason why it's wonderful and good.
[01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.973]  What is their, what is, how do they try to sell this garbage?
[01:10:33.733 --> 01:10:36.034]  Okay, the reasons that they gave for this
[01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:42.460]  Was that it would raise more money for them, which they feel they are cash-strapped.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:51.344]  The fact of the matter is, they are among the very richest of any wildlife management agency in the nation.
[01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:53.826]  Basically, it's just the money, Rev.
[01:10:53.846 --> 01:10:56.347]  They just want to get some more money and take more control of your land.
[01:10:56.427 --> 01:10:58.408]  That's their excuse, but it's also a power grab.
[01:10:58.488 --> 01:11:00.369]  It's a power grab and a money grab, both, right?
[01:11:00.549 --> 01:11:01.390]  Well, that figures.
[01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:05.112]  That's exactly right, and the money part,
[01:11:06.724 --> 01:11:11.908]  They are today, they're the largest single landowner in the state of Missouri.
[01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:13.729]  They have 2,300 employees.
[01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:17.912]  They're hardly a pauper group.
[01:11:18.633 --> 01:11:31.001]  We have here, they got, they were able to get a constitutional amendment passed wherein they get a one-eighth cent sales tax forever.
[01:11:31.482 --> 01:11:32.583]  There is no ending on it.
[01:11:32.623 --> 01:11:34.604]  There is no control over it by the legislature.
[01:11:35.231 --> 01:11:36.871]  It goes directly to them.
[01:11:37.671 --> 01:11:41.232]  So basically, you're the milk cow and they're the milking machine.
[01:11:42.452 --> 01:11:47.193]  And they want to put more stringent regulations on it.
[01:11:47.713 --> 01:11:56.435]  The one thing they're hanging on, now they backed off on the rest of it, but on this one thing, they want us to register our property.
[01:11:57.495 --> 01:12:00.395]  Now you know that that will be forming a nexus with them.
[01:12:02.016 --> 01:12:04.436]  Once you give them your legal description,
[01:12:05.436 --> 01:12:10.641]  And sign up so you can get this pre-permit to hunt on your own property.
[01:12:10.661 --> 01:12:13.604]  You know the language of that is so offensive.
[01:12:14.365 --> 01:12:16.967]  They say that they will issue a privilege.
[01:12:17.588 --> 01:12:19.029]  Issue you a privilege.
[01:12:20.851 --> 01:12:21.751]  We own the land.
[01:12:23.433 --> 01:12:26.396]  Why do we have to have a state agency give us a privilege?
[01:12:27.549 --> 01:12:28.430]  It's exactly right.
[01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:29.210]  It's your land.
[01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:34.033]  The Constitution says you have the right to life, liberty, and happiness.
[01:12:34.133 --> 01:12:35.214]  It is your property.
[01:12:35.234 --> 01:12:36.695]  You should be able to do what you want there.
[01:12:36.715 --> 01:12:40.817]  You're not breaking any laws, but what they want to do is they want to put you under some type of legislation.
[01:12:40.877 --> 01:12:42.158]  They want some more money from you.
[01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:45.160]  And really, I think they also want a description of your land, Bob.
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:51.224]  I think that they'd like to have the lay of your land and say, oh, well, it looks like you've been underreporting on your taxes.
[01:12:51.824 --> 01:12:55.987]  Your land's worth a little bit more, so I think we're going to juice you a little bit harder on the IRS.
[01:12:56.007 --> 01:12:57.949]  This is really multifaceted.
[01:12:58.009 --> 01:12:59.210]  How do people help you, Russell?
[01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:01.011]  How can the listeners get involved?
[01:13:02.192 --> 01:13:10.038]  The contacts that were made directly to the Department of Conservation was a big, big help in this.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.203]  You know, like I said, they said they got contacts from 10,000 people.
[01:13:17.504 --> 01:13:20.967]  This goes back to, you know, we hear so often that
[01:13:21.775 --> 01:13:22.916]  Well, it's a federal law.
[01:13:23.036 --> 01:13:24.137]  Well, it's a state law.
[01:13:24.697 --> 01:13:25.598]  Nothing we can do about it.
[01:13:26.179 --> 01:13:27.259]  That isn't true.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.443]  You know, we're still governed by the consent of the governed.
[01:13:32.644 --> 01:13:47.235]  And if we give away these rights and these privileges, then of course there are always those agencies and their friends and the non-governmental agencies that want to control our land.
[01:13:47.275 --> 01:13:50.278]  They don't necessarily so much want to own it,
[01:13:50.834 --> 01:13:52.854]  They don't have to if they can control it.
[01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:59.516]  And let us be at the expense and responsibility for the land.
[01:13:59.976 --> 01:14:02.916]  But there seems to be no end to this.
[01:14:03.017 --> 01:14:09.058]  But we don't have to give away these rights and privileges.
[01:14:10.238 --> 01:14:15.099]  And they cannot necessarily take them unless we do cooperate with them.
[01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:19.527]  And that's why they're asking for your consent on this form.
[01:14:19.587 --> 01:14:28.753]  And even if it's not a monetary value, like you said, they'd be willing to give permits for free to these landowners of, what is it, five acres or around there.
[01:14:28.813 --> 01:14:32.436]  But that's really just a... Yeah, they want to get you under control.
[01:14:32.596 --> 01:14:36.639]  And, you know, this is just another infringement on personal freedoms and liberty.
[01:14:36.959 --> 01:14:39.421]  And the state coming in to control your land is just...
[01:14:40.221 --> 01:14:42.363]  It's just deplorable, don't you think, Bob?
[01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:43.324]  I understand.
[01:14:43.344 --> 01:14:44.665]  They don't want to control your land.
[01:14:44.685 --> 01:14:50.189]  They want to control the animals that you have on your land with these national animal identification system nonsense.
[01:14:50.770 --> 01:15:00.837]  I mean, I also have heard, and this is not a joke, that of course, globally, they want a cow fart tax on every cow that you have.
[01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:01.238]  Methane.
[01:15:01.258 --> 01:15:01.418]  Methane.
[01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:13.565]  This, for global warming, you have to have, you know, you count your cows, and you say, okay, how many cows you have, times how many times that they fart every day, times how many days a year, times how much methane, divided by the coefficient of seven, or whatever.
[01:15:13.585 --> 01:15:16.186]  Well, it certainly seems that the new administration is going to do this.
[01:15:16.246 --> 01:15:29.974]  Their climate czar, or global warming czar, is Carol M. Browner of the Sustainable World Society, which is calling for global governance, and of course, she's there to address the economy and climate change.
[01:15:30.154 --> 01:15:32.015]  Perhaps she's the one to promote the carbon tax?
[01:15:32.635 --> 01:15:33.856]  Yeah, well, why not?
[01:15:33.976 --> 01:15:35.957]  I mean, it's all about control.
[01:15:36.057 --> 01:15:38.518]  It's all about destroying private property rights.
[01:15:38.578 --> 01:15:39.938]  It's all about destroying the middle class.
[01:15:41.339 --> 01:15:43.260]  Basically, it's kind of commie, don't you think?
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.040]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.602]  So aside from writing these people letters and calling their office, what can people do, Russell?
[01:15:50.103 --> 01:15:55.945]  Let me go back on what you were just saying about the NACE, National Animal Identification System.
[01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:59.307]  We've been very, very much involved with that.
[01:16:00.017 --> 01:16:06.242]  Consider that to be a gross infringement on private property rights.
[01:16:06.342 --> 01:16:09.504]  And we've, uh, we've really been battling that.
[01:16:09.764 --> 01:16:19.552]  And, you know, we got it, we got a law passed here in Missouri to prevent, to prevent mandatory premise registration.
[01:16:20.132 --> 01:16:26.577]  But of course, USDA is trying to, uh, circumvent that and keep coming up with ways to, uh,
[01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:51.582]  Get it in there anyway, but there's much suspicion here and I could not, I would not be able to document it, but there's much suspicion that this land registration with the Department of Conservation could very well be tied in to the USDA's premise registration for the NACE program.
[01:16:52.442 --> 01:16:55.363]  You know, USDA does pay a bounty.
[01:16:56.328 --> 01:17:07.331]  They enter into these agreements with various organizations, that if you'll go out here and get premise registrations for you, why we'll give you so much money.
[01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:12.853]  So, we don't know that to be a fact, but every time it's mentioned, that's the first thing that's brought up.
[01:17:13.133 --> 01:17:13.593]  Aha!
[01:17:14.413 --> 01:17:16.073]  It's the NACE, you know?
[01:17:16.113 --> 01:17:19.534]  Well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but it's the same type of thing.
[01:17:20.575 --> 01:17:25.056]  They want to get you, they want to get a nexus formed with your property.
[01:17:25.564 --> 01:17:28.145]  You can put that in the category, I wouldn't put it past him.
[01:17:31.207 --> 01:17:31.927]  Certainly can.
[01:17:33.508 --> 01:17:35.689]  So again, how do we take these guys on?
[01:17:35.729 --> 01:17:37.990]  I mean, these are the authoritized.
[01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.831]  They're the ones telling us that they have all the power.
[01:17:40.872 --> 01:17:41.592]  That's not the case.
[01:17:41.612 --> 01:17:43.693]  This is supposed to be a government for and by the people.
[01:17:44.013 --> 01:17:45.294]  So how do we take that power back?
[01:17:46.434 --> 01:17:51.797]  We work quite closely with our county government.
[01:17:54.793 --> 01:17:58.814]  Every county has some sort of commission that runs their county.
[01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:09.557]  And these are very much overlooked entities that have a lot more power than, uh, you know, they've been in our area.
[01:18:09.597 --> 01:18:15.359]  They used to be thought of just as sort of road district, uh, to maintain the roads and that was about it.
[01:18:16.299 --> 01:18:22.861]  But by this handing out of our own tax money back to us,
[01:18:23.527 --> 01:18:23.907]  We're good to go.
[01:18:52.654 --> 01:18:55.576]  We send them with no conditions except their spending.
[01:18:58.137 --> 01:19:04.801]  We also work really well with our state legislators.
[01:19:05.682 --> 01:19:11.265]  And you can always find some representatives or senators that will listen.
[01:19:12.506 --> 01:19:20.671]  I think I heard one of our senators state it quite clearly when he was telling some of
[01:19:22.273 --> 01:19:34.897]  Fellow legislators, he said, when you have a group in your district that can call a meeting and four or five hundred people show up, he said, you better listen.
[01:19:34.917 --> 01:19:36.978]  That's right.
[01:19:37.018 --> 01:19:38.318]  The power is in the people.
[01:19:38.619 --> 01:19:40.259]  And we need to get together.
[01:19:40.279 --> 01:19:41.419]  We need to form in mass.
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.360]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:45.041]  I'm with Bob Dacey and Russell Wood.
[01:19:45.061 --> 01:19:46.001]  We'll be back after the break.
[01:19:53.991 --> 01:19:55.532]  These are strange new days.
[01:19:55.892 --> 01:19:57.653]  Foreclosures are at record highs.
[01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:59.193]  People are losing their jobs.
[01:19:59.473 --> 01:20:01.454]  The threat of a terrorist attack looms.
[01:20:01.694 --> 01:20:03.875]  Food supplies are at an all-time low.
[01:20:04.055 --> 01:20:06.176]  And now we have a new untested president.
[01:20:06.396 --> 01:20:08.077]  The time of change is upon us.
[01:20:08.177 --> 01:20:12.879]  And to those of you who are in the know, you realize that the most difficult times have yet to be seen.
[01:20:13.599 --> 01:20:14.040]  We're good.
[01:20:32.483 --> 01:20:33.324]  We're good.
[01:20:54.452 --> 01:20:58.293]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:20:58.313 --> 01:20:59.574]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:20:59.734 --> 01:21:03.295]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:21:03.595 --> 01:21:06.116]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:21:06.516 --> 01:21:08.257]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:10.758]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:22.384]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:21:22.424 --> 01:21:26.386]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:21:26.446 --> 01:21:29.528]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:21:29.728 --> 01:21:31.930]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-GOLD.
[01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:36.472]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:37.253]  And we knew what to do.
[01:22:01.527 --> 01:22:02.547]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:22:02.787 --> 01:22:09.190]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:18.333]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:22:18.717 --> 01:22:25.523]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:22:25.823 --> 01:22:28.865]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:34.169]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:37.372]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:22:37.832 --> 01:22:44.718]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:22:47.551 --> 01:22:48.756]  That was the government-sponsored terror.
[01:22:49.198 --> 01:22:51.688]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:22:53.112 --> 01:23:02.859]  SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand knives such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, K-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.

[01:23:46.011 --> 01:23:46.211]  That's 1-800-234-8654.
[01:23:46.231 --> 01:23:47.212]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:47.232 --> 01:23:49.334]  We're in with Russell Wood and Russell finishing up
[01:24:10.694 --> 01:24:21.640]  You know, obviously, this is infringement on property rights, on a person's individual sovereign rights, and with, like, the NAIS chipping of all these animals, we're obviously against that.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.102]  Why don't you give out a phone number that people can help you out at, Russell?
[01:24:26.322 --> 01:24:28.503]  Um, we have a website now.
[01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:34.987]  We didn't have last time, but as a result of our talk on your show last time, we have one set up for us.
[01:24:35.447 --> 01:24:35.767]  Oh, excellent.
[01:24:35.787 --> 01:24:38.369]  And they will contact Ozarks PRC.
[01:24:40.836 --> 01:24:44.860]  No, it's new and it's not complete and fancy, but it'll be working.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:49.203]  And that's O-Z-A-R-K-S-P-R-C dot com?
[01:24:49.744 --> 01:24:50.164]  That's it.
[01:24:51.525 --> 01:24:57.089]  All right, Russell, finish up just your last point, why you're doing this and why people should help.
[01:24:59.291 --> 01:25:04.756]  We're doing this as a continued work in preserving our property rights.
[01:25:05.556 --> 01:25:08.939]  And let me say that there is no substitute
[01:25:09.315 --> 01:25:11.537]  For personal involvement in these issues.
[01:25:12.998 --> 01:25:19.664]  We might wish in an ideal world that we didn't have to spend our time, energy, and money protecting our rights.
[01:25:20.405 --> 01:25:22.987]  But in the real world, that's exactly what we have to do.
[01:25:23.047 --> 01:25:24.329]  No one's going to do it for us.
[01:25:25.670 --> 01:25:35.619]  We had an example here in Missouri of legislation that was passed by a naive, uninformed legislature
[01:25:36.556 --> 01:25:38.317]  That thought they were doing the right thing.
[01:25:38.337 --> 01:25:41.959]  They had no reason to believe it was anything onerous about it.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.981]  And we weren't even aware of it until it had become law.
[01:25:46.702 --> 01:25:48.803]  And we got involved with it.
[01:25:49.463 --> 01:25:54.046]  Got the thing changed through public involvement.
[01:25:54.946 --> 01:25:58.248]  If you have to get out there and have meetings, have them.
[01:25:58.808 --> 01:26:02.510]  You know, invite the legislators to come and listen to what you have to say.
[01:26:03.251 --> 01:26:05.452]  In our meetings, it may sound rather
[01:26:06.351 --> 01:26:06.771]  Crude.
[01:26:07.191 --> 01:26:14.314]  But what we tell our legislators is, it's more important that you listen to us than that you give us a speech.
[01:26:15.574 --> 01:26:16.874]  And they accept that.
[01:26:17.435 --> 01:26:28.718]  And they are, after they get over the, uh, you know, that's not usually the way they're greeted, but, um, they appreciate it because they want to know what the people want.
[01:26:28.758 --> 01:26:30.359]  The legislators are not all crooks.
[01:26:30.899 --> 01:26:33.480]  They're good people that are trying to do the best they can.
[01:26:34.488 --> 01:26:38.752]  But unless you contact them and let them know, all they hear from is the other side.
[01:26:39.633 --> 01:26:41.354]  So we have to be involved.
[01:26:41.434 --> 01:26:42.735]  Clear up to our eyebrows.
[01:26:42.916 --> 01:26:48.020]  And it may get to be a chore, but that's what we have to do.
[01:26:49.041 --> 01:26:50.582]  Alright, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:26:51.083 --> 01:26:52.684]  We're going to take your calls in the next segment.
[01:26:52.724 --> 01:26:55.287]  Before we do, I wanted to go to this video.
[01:26:55.587 --> 01:26:56.408]  I forgot to mention it.
[01:26:56.908 --> 01:26:57.829]  Earlier we did a little 9-11 news.
[01:26:59.301 --> 01:26:59.701]  I don't know.
[01:27:13.294 --> 01:27:20.160]  Who is on Rescue Me, he was Reggie Jackson in The Bronx is Burning, he's been in some major motion pictures.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:30.068]  His character Franco, which is on the popular TV program Rescue Me on FX, started talking a little 9-11 truth-skiing hutch in episode 2.
[01:27:30.948 --> 01:27:35.052]  We knew this was going to happen because Dennis Leary said that it was going to be one of the subplots.
[01:27:35.492 --> 01:27:36.393]  So let's take it away.
[01:27:38.464 --> 01:27:47.971]  If you're gonna hear from me, you're not gonna hear from anybody else because, uh, my opinions, well, let's just say they're not popular.
[01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:48.311]  9-11?
[01:27:50.092 --> 01:27:50.753]  Inside job.
[01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:51.614]  Plain and simple.
[01:27:51.674 --> 01:27:55.937]  All you gotta do is connect the dots and, uh, and I'm not talking about the dots everyone's already heard about.
[01:27:55.977 --> 01:28:02.722]  I'm not talking about Bush sitting in that school reading a book about a goat to those kids for seven and a half minutes after he was told to nose.
[01:28:03.302 --> 01:28:03.962]  Everybody knows that.
[01:28:05.183 --> 01:28:05.964]  I ain't talking about
[01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:10.577]  A massive neoconservative government effort.
[01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:12.460]  It's been in the works for over 20 years.
[01:28:12.481 --> 01:28:14.765]  You ever hear of PNAC?
[01:28:15.205 --> 01:28:16.428]  Project for New American Century.
[01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:17.991]  Perhaps.
[01:28:19.086 --> 01:28:22.889]  Well, according to them, the end goal of their effort is American global domination.
[01:28:23.169 --> 01:28:24.870]  Full-spectrum dominance, they call it.
[01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:28.953]  Now, the first question that pops to my mind is, how do you pull that off in this day and age?
[01:28:28.993 --> 01:28:30.854]  Well, according to them, you do it in four steps.
[01:28:31.034 --> 01:28:33.155]  First, we must control the world's oil.
[01:28:33.395 --> 01:28:35.497]  Especially the oil in Central Asia and the Middle East.
[01:28:35.537 --> 01:28:40.520]  Now, I don't have to remind you that Bush-Cheney, they came to power with plans already made to attack Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:28:41.218 --> 01:28:47.883]  Number two, we have to make huge technological advances with our armed forces, that for some reason include the capability to fight wars from outer space.
[01:28:48.363 --> 01:28:53.507]  Number three, surprise surprise, huge increases in military spending to pay for the above.
[01:28:53.527 --> 01:28:55.008]  130 billion dollars a year worth.
[01:28:55.789 --> 01:29:03.254]  Never mind the sick and dying first responders, 9-11's heroes, who can't even pay their light bill, let alone their medical bills, and a lot of whom are ending up homeless because of it.
[01:29:03.774 --> 01:29:05.656]  I guess there's just not enough room in the budget for them.
[01:29:06.016 --> 01:29:09.979]  Number four, and this is key, we change the definition of preemptive attack.
[01:29:10.459 --> 01:29:16.621]  So we can unilaterally bomb the shit out of, invade, and occupy countries even if they pose no credible threat or had nothing to do with 9-11.
[01:29:16.681 --> 01:29:17.121]  One problem.
[01:29:17.941 --> 01:29:19.802]  How are you going to put it into action?
[01:29:20.442 --> 01:29:22.663]  I mean, the American people are never going to go for no shit like that, right?
[01:29:23.323 --> 01:29:23.943]  We're damn straight.
[01:29:24.783 --> 01:29:25.784]  Now what you need is an event.
[01:29:28.284 --> 01:29:29.525]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:29.545 --> 01:29:31.505]  And we'll be back after this.
[01:29:31.545 --> 01:29:33.726]  PrisonPlanet.com InfoWars.com
[01:29:43.985 --> 01:29:46.967]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[01:29:54.096 --> 01:29:57.397]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[01:29:57.637 --> 01:29:59.997]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[01:31:04.906 --> 01:31:05.406]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:05.706 --> 01:31:06.667]  This is his M.O.
[01:31:06.687 --> 01:31:08.008]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:08.068 --> 01:31:09.729]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:10.069 --> 01:31:16.813]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:17.213 --> 01:31:17.653]  Some U.S.
[01:31:17.693 --> 01:31:23.337]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:24.037 --> 01:31:27.579]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:27.919 --> 01:31:37.784]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:38.024 --> 01:31:38.764]  Fabled Enemies.

[01:31:53.911 --> 01:32:03.999]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[01:33:09.758 --> 01:33:13.962]  Big ups to Daniel Senjata, getting that in the script of Rescue Me.
[01:33:14.022 --> 01:33:19.807]  It's always nice to see a mainline talk, or a mainline show, saying just that.
[01:33:19.847 --> 01:33:20.687]  It's an inside job.
[01:33:22.289 --> 01:33:23.270]  By the well-connected.
[01:33:26.112 --> 01:33:31.537]  Alright folks, we're gonna hit another news story in a moment, then we're gonna go to your calls in the last 30 minutes of the show.
[01:33:34.073 --> 01:33:39.699]  First, I'd like to thank everybody who bid and made it possible for us to sell the Bullhorn for such a high amount.
[01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:42.962]  It's all going to go back into this office, and believe it or not, we do need the funds.
[01:33:43.002 --> 01:33:44.123]  We need more workers here.
[01:33:44.143 --> 01:33:46.125]  We'd like to put out three movies a year.
[01:33:46.305 --> 01:33:48.567]  You know, we have trouble putting out one or two movies a year.
[01:33:48.587 --> 01:33:49.709]  We'd like to put out three movies.
[01:33:50.089 --> 01:33:52.752]  We'd like to do more than 22 hours of radio a week.
[01:33:52.792 --> 01:33:53.392]  We'd like to do 45.
[01:33:54.113 --> 01:33:56.876]  You know, but that's not possible without your help.
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:08.909]  And another great thing going on if you're in Texas this weekend starts Friday where there's going to be three seminars put on by the Heartland Emergency Center, heartlandemergency.com.
[01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:13.354]  And that starts on Friday, January 16th at 6 p.m.
[01:34:13.394 --> 01:34:18.738]  in Fredericksburg at the Ag Building, 95 Frederick Road, and Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m.
[01:34:18.778 --> 01:34:20.180]  in Austin at Brave New Books.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.282]  The good people over at Brave New Books put a lot of
[01:34:22.882 --> 01:34:26.823]  Great things on, and that is at 1904 Guadalupe Street.
[01:34:27.143 --> 01:34:30.283]  This is your chance to learn everything you need to know about freeze-dried storable food.
[01:34:30.603 --> 01:34:33.144]  Again, Friday the Ag Building in Fredericksburg at 6 p.m.
[01:34:33.184 --> 01:34:35.924]  Saturday and Sunday at Brave New Books at 2 p.m.
[01:34:36.104 --> 01:34:37.865]  Or you can call Heartland Emergency at 512-921-9015 or 9016.
[01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:38.165]  That's 512-921-9015, 9016.
[01:34:38.245 --> 01:34:40.085]  And remember, it's heartlandemergency.com.
[01:34:40.105 --> 01:34:41.405]  We all hope you come out there.
[01:34:53.348 --> 01:34:55.891]  Alright, before we go to your calls, I want to play this clip.
[01:34:55.931 --> 01:34:57.913]  Now, I noticed this in the news a couple weeks ago.
[01:34:58.013 --> 01:35:04.541]  People were talking about texting and how a lot of teenagers are texting each other with naked pics of one another.
[01:35:04.621 --> 01:35:05.362]  It's kid stuff.
[01:35:05.462 --> 01:35:08.585]  I mean, even when I was a younger guy and the internet wasn't that big, you know.
[01:35:09.673 --> 01:35:10.613]  Kids are scandalous.
[01:35:10.714 --> 01:35:11.974]  Young people are scandalous.
[01:35:12.074 --> 01:35:13.995]  When you're in high school, you do some crazy things.
[01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:20.838]  But now, apparently, they want to charge some of these kids with pictures that are quote-unquote child porn.
[01:35:21.219 --> 01:35:29.983]  No, these are their teenage girlfriends sending them that, but they just ruled the day before yesterday that 18-year-olds were allowed to have sex with their high school teachers.
[01:35:30.603 --> 01:35:31.864]  Seems a little twisted to me, Bob.
[01:35:31.904 --> 01:35:33.244]  Let's play the CNN clip here.
[01:35:35.285 --> 01:35:36.226]  Comes out of sitting naked.
[01:35:37.233 --> 01:35:37.813]  We're good to go.
[01:35:53.504 --> 01:35:54.644]  Yes, they should be punished.
[01:35:54.684 --> 01:35:57.205]  The question, child porn charges, is that the way to go?
[01:35:57.225 --> 01:36:00.086]  We're taking your calls, 1-877-TELL-HLN.
[01:36:00.206 --> 01:36:06.748]  Joining me now, former sex crimes prosecutor, Wendy Murphy, also with a sexuality educator, Sarah Locker.
[01:36:06.808 --> 01:36:07.948]  Alright, Wendy, let's start with you.
[01:36:08.448 --> 01:36:10.769]  Child porn charges, is that really the way to go here?
[01:36:11.618 --> 01:36:13.720]  You know, it does sound heavy-handed, Mike.
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:14.461]  I have to say.
[01:36:14.701 --> 01:36:17.163]  On the other hand, there really isn't anything else to charge.
[01:36:17.644 --> 01:36:21.387]  So, if you have nothing else and you want to stop the behavior, you use what you can.
[01:36:21.427 --> 01:36:22.649]  They're not going to go to jail.
[01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:24.370]  They're not going to become listed sex offenders.
[01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:25.792]  I guarantee this will be a plea deal.
[01:36:26.052 --> 01:36:27.553]  No, I guarantee that if they do...
[01:36:29.414 --> 01:36:31.655]  This is not a game.
[01:36:32.256 --> 01:36:33.776]  This is serious business.
[01:36:34.036 --> 01:36:41.559]  And number one, adults in the real child porn business will hunt you down and take advantage if they find these pictures, and they will.
[01:36:41.939 --> 01:36:51.883]  The other thing is, keep in mind, if you think as an adult child porn maker that you can use kids to do this stuff with impunity, you're going to use them as your murals.
[01:36:51.903 --> 01:36:52.683]  Alright, let's cut the clip.
[01:36:54.464 --> 01:36:55.345]  Unbelievable to me.
[01:36:55.385 --> 01:36:57.767]  They're trying to associate this with child pornographers.
[01:36:57.847 --> 01:36:58.267]  Isn't that nuts?
[01:36:58.287 --> 01:37:00.108]  These are 16 and 17 year old kids.
[01:37:00.128 --> 01:37:03.851]  Well, I think that the 16 and 17 year old kids shouldn't be doing that.
[01:37:04.071 --> 01:37:05.532]  Yeah, I'm not applauding the behavior.
[01:37:05.552 --> 01:37:10.636]  How, you know, because that shows some of the, you know, just the moral decay in the country, everything like that.
[01:37:10.856 --> 01:37:11.096]  Sure.
[01:37:14.077 --> 01:37:16.399]  They're trying to turn this into a federal case here.
[01:37:16.419 --> 01:37:22.704]  You know, they're using that as an excuse, and I'm sure they'll use that as an excuse to go after everything.
[01:37:22.724 --> 01:37:27.248]  You know, go after the internet, go after cell phone usage, go after whatever.
[01:37:27.268 --> 01:37:28.629]  It's always for the children.
[01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:30.651]  That is patently ridiculous.
[01:37:30.971 --> 01:37:32.172]  Absolutely patently ridiculous.
[01:37:32.232 --> 01:37:40.099]  Alright, we have a long tradition in this show of going to those who disagree with us first, so that's why we're going to go to Dan in Texas first.
[01:37:40.159 --> 01:37:40.980]  Dan, what's on your mind?
[01:37:41.772 --> 01:37:48.317]  Hey, yeah, I just wanted to get on the air to make a comment before you guys get all excited about rescuing me having 9-11 plots.
[01:37:48.938 --> 01:37:54.162]  I'm just reading a press release from Dennis Leary here who said they had to get some suck plot lines out of the way first.
[01:37:54.563 --> 01:37:55.483]  Yeah, yeah, I know that.
[01:37:55.584 --> 01:37:58.286]  It basically just means that he thinks it's a bunch of BS.
[01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:02.770]  And I just wanted to say you guys report nothing but hoaxes and you're nuttier than school shit.
[01:38:05.094 --> 01:38:06.255]  That's great, let's get rid of him.
[01:38:08.436 --> 01:38:09.417]  We report nothing but hoaxes.
[01:38:09.437 --> 01:38:10.398]  Nothing but hoaxes.
[01:38:10.438 --> 01:38:15.301]  Didn't we just report that they're going to charge kids with child porn for texting, but that CNN report, that's a hoax.
[01:38:15.321 --> 01:38:16.142]  That's a hoax.
[01:38:16.242 --> 01:38:21.866]  It's a hoax that Obama has a global warming czar coming on that's for global government, that's a hoax.
[01:38:21.886 --> 01:38:24.828]  It's a hoax that the head of the CFR is going to be his foreign policy advisor.
[01:38:24.988 --> 01:38:26.849]  That is definitely a hoax also.
[01:38:27.130 --> 01:38:30.312]  It's also a hoax that, why doesn't so many people think alike?
[01:38:30.772 --> 01:38:33.173]  Well, because they're brainwashed, much like Dan in Texas.
[01:38:33.193 --> 01:38:34.874]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is a hoax.
[01:38:35.554 --> 01:38:36.955]  The NAFTA Superhighway is a hoax.
[01:38:37.155 --> 01:38:38.856]  Everything is a hoax.
[01:38:39.316 --> 01:38:46.039]  Kissinger didn't go on CNBC this week and basically call for a new world order under Obama.
[01:38:46.059 --> 01:38:46.659]  He never did that.
[01:38:46.679 --> 01:38:48.400]  That guy hasn't seen enough American Idol.
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:49.800]  He needs to watch American Idol 24-7.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:50.480]  And you know what?
[01:38:51.761 --> 01:38:53.222]  Hey Jason, thanks for taking my call.
[01:38:53.242 --> 01:38:53.843]  I'm a first time caller.
[01:38:53.863 --> 01:38:55.044]  I've been listening for about a year.
[01:39:18.759 --> 01:39:23.343]  The reason I'm calling is because I'd like to bring people's attention to the larger picture here.
[01:39:23.363 --> 01:39:30.108]  I think a lot of times people get lost in the semantics of, oh, this person's a member of the CFR, the Trilateral Commission.
[01:39:30.148 --> 01:39:36.072]  If you understand history and you really look at it, you can see that what we're facing, the real enemy, is the British Empire.
[01:39:38.174 --> 01:39:44.078]  It's about sovereign nation states against the system of empire, and I think what we really need to do is focus on
[01:39:44.693 --> 01:39:48.395]  How to fight that system, not just individual people or members of whatever group.
[01:39:48.415 --> 01:40:00.480]  Well, I'll say this, there's definitely some truth to what you're saying in that the British oligarchy still controls a lot of the monetary system and a lot of the actual infrastructure in not only this country, but Europe and around the world.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:08.264]  And in addition to that, guys, you know, you think about it, this thing about Barack Obama, if he was born in Kenya,
[01:40:08.844 --> 01:40:15.469]  That was British Zanzibar back when he was born there, so it very well could be that the Redcoats have taken the country back over again.
[01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:16.850]  Effective on the 20th.
[01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:24.176]  Well, I think that this is an international crime syndicate anyway, and that's why, you know, in Fabled Enemies I go over the International Intelligence Organization.
[01:40:24.196 --> 01:40:34.524]  I think that we talk about the CFR and the Trilats, because those are outworked, think-type type organizations that people can relate to and that are in the mainstream media, but obviously... They were created by the British, huh?
[01:40:34.984 --> 01:40:36.365]  Yeah, no, the strings go further.
[01:40:36.406 --> 01:40:37.166]  I'm with you there, man.
[01:40:37.206 --> 01:40:41.070]  Hey, I encourage people to go check out, you know, all the Riddles in Stone movies are pretty good.
[01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:45.514]  The last one that I watched, the second one, not Riddles in Stone movies, what is it?
[01:40:45.794 --> 01:40:48.396]  America's Secret Beginnings and Riddles in Stone is the second one.
[01:40:48.416 --> 01:40:51.078]  It really goes over how British influence is still around.
[01:40:51.098 --> 01:40:51.899]  I thank you for the call.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.200]  We got a ton of callers.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:55.302]  Let's go to Kurt in Colorado.
[01:40:55.382 --> 01:40:56.163]  Kurt, what's on your mind?
[01:40:58.063 --> 01:41:05.986]  Hello, I'd like to thank you for taking my call and thank you guys for getting the truth facts out there for people.
[01:41:06.006 --> 01:41:14.770]  I think there's a lot of blind, ignorant people out there, but I think you're reaching some of them.
[01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:27.015]  And I just wanted to say when I was 18 years old, it was law that you had to go register for selective service, which I did on my 18th birthday proudly.
[01:41:28.601 --> 01:41:46.433]  The funny thing about it is, though, is I swore on a Bible and swore to God to uphold the Constitution no matter what the cost, and which I'll do, and I just wondered if you knew when Selective Service stopped or...
[01:41:47.068 --> 01:41:50.590]  No, I mean, they still, at 18, I also had to sign over my paper.
[01:41:50.630 --> 01:41:53.671]  In fact, they make it a kind of fun thing in high school for us.
[01:41:54.271 --> 01:41:56.632]  They're like, oh, and you can also register to vote while you do this.
[01:41:57.053 --> 01:41:59.414]  So you're registering for Selective Service and to vote.
[01:41:59.434 --> 01:42:06.577]  It puts you into a database in case that they ever do call up conscription or the draft so that you're immediately put into there and they don't have to just
[01:42:06.937 --> 01:42:08.278]  Hey Jason, how are you guys doing?
[01:42:08.358 --> 01:42:10.500]  Mr. Cook, I believe that was his name, Russell Cook,
[01:42:32.614 --> 01:42:32.854]  Yes.
[01:42:33.775 --> 01:42:40.078]  Seems like a very smart, nice man, but I think he's missing the bigger picture.
[01:42:40.538 --> 01:42:46.782]  I'd like to read something very short for you and hit one nail on the head, and then I want to touch on one other thing briefly.
[01:42:47.422 --> 01:42:47.762]  Okay.
[01:42:47.842 --> 01:42:56.507]  Sustainable development is a plan for global control using land resource restrictions, social transformation through education and other programs to accomplish this end.
[01:42:56.997 --> 01:43:03.743]  The land use element of sustainable development calls for the implementation of two action plans designed to eliminate private property.
[01:43:04.124 --> 01:43:06.005]  The Wildlands Project and Smart Growth.
[01:43:06.366 --> 01:43:20.679]  What he's actually a victim of and the people in his state are the victim of is the rewilding or Wildlands Project because it is a compartmentalization and it is a very difficult task
[01:43:21.184 --> 01:43:28.547]  And what they're trying to do is trick those people into registering their land and doing the first half of the job for them.
[01:43:29.027 --> 01:43:31.708]  Later on, that land will be off-limits.
[01:43:31.928 --> 01:43:39.430]  I'm looking at the map of the Wildlands Project and in his state, about half of his state is red.
[01:43:39.610 --> 01:43:41.171]  Red is off-limits.
[01:43:41.511 --> 01:43:46.232]  The other part is yellow and that is the buffer zone for the off-limits zone.
[01:43:46.513 --> 01:43:50.734]  So I think maybe he needs to chase that rabbit for a little while and see what happens because
[01:43:51.098 --> 01:44:01.143]  If he brings this to the front and accuses them, as I have done here in Washington, then he will get some additional attention and they'll realize that they're even more awake.
[01:44:01.583 --> 01:44:08.687]  The second nail I'd like to strike is that moron that called you a little bit earlier and jumped your bones about being a profiteer.
[01:44:08.707 --> 01:44:15.210]  I am so sick and tired of these phony patriots and their socialist mentality.
[01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:17.351]  Most of them are stinky, smelly old men.
[01:44:17.884 --> 01:44:35.659]  Who sit around and blabber and talk everything to death, and when you come right down to it, if you get to know them, they're taking checks from the government for unemployment, for SSI, LNI, whatever, you know, they're usually on the dole, and that's why they have so much time to sit around and bump their gums.
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:41.945]  I'd like to say to this man a quote from the speech of John Galt in the book Atlas Shrugged.
[01:44:42.005 --> 01:44:45.628]  It says, that you demand your wages, but deny us our profits.
[01:44:46.044 --> 01:44:49.988]  May you be damned, and little do you know, you are!
[01:44:51.429 --> 01:44:52.290]  Great caller!
[01:44:52.710 --> 01:44:54.612]  Thank you, thank you so much, John.
[01:44:54.712 --> 01:44:55.833]  Sometimes the truth hurts.
[01:44:56.013 --> 01:44:56.814]  It's the truth, man.
[01:44:56.854 --> 01:44:58.395]  Listen, we've got to make a living here.
[01:44:58.495 --> 01:44:58.755]  Ouch.
[01:44:59.036 --> 01:45:05.822]  I mean, I guess I could go back to flippin' pies, but I won't be on the radio, and then I'll just be making you your pizza, you know?
[01:45:05.862 --> 01:45:09.605]  Maybe you can get a job at NPR and have the taxpayers pay for you to tell the truth.
[01:45:09.625 --> 01:45:12.948]  Yeah, maybe I should call up Air America and be somebody's coffee boy.
[01:45:13.228 --> 01:45:13.908]  That's what I should do.
[01:45:13.948 --> 01:45:14.428]  Yeah, really.
[01:45:14.588 --> 01:45:16.469]  Maybe I get to guest like ten minutes a week.
[01:45:16.489 --> 01:45:31.532]  You know, when that caller said that about you, I'm thinking, you know, you guys, a few years ago when you did Loose Change, you were sitting out there passing out 3D DVDs by the gross, by the thousands, to everybody who would take one.
[01:45:31.933 --> 01:45:32.833]  Shame on you!
[01:45:32.873 --> 01:45:33.773]  Yeah, how dare I?
[01:45:33.833 --> 01:45:34.613]  How dare you?
[01:45:34.773 --> 01:45:36.114]  Alright, let's go to our next caller.
[01:45:36.154 --> 01:45:38.634]  Let's go to Raymond in Oregon.
[01:45:38.694 --> 01:45:39.574]  Raymond, what's on your mind?
[01:45:40.455 --> 01:45:41.555]  Hey Jason, how's it going?
[01:45:41.875 --> 01:45:42.135]  Good, man.
[01:45:43.246 --> 01:45:48.649]  Hey, um, I was calling about your, uh, Officer Jack, uh, I can't remember his last name.
[01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:49.189]  Jack McGlann.
[01:45:49.429 --> 01:45:49.589]  Yeah.
[01:45:50.250 --> 01:45:51.010]  Right, Jack McGlann.
[01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:57.534]  He was in the military and I'm currently in the Oregon National Guard and we're getting ready to go to Iraq for 10 months.
[01:45:58.014 --> 01:45:58.294]  Geez.
[01:45:58.714 --> 01:45:59.475]  Well, yeah.
[01:45:59.795 --> 01:46:09.320]  Well, recently I had the opportunity to go up to our military command in Oregon and speak with a, um, individual about,
[01:46:09.949 --> 01:46:11.369]  Problems I'm having in the military.
[01:46:11.489 --> 01:46:17.271]  And during the course of events, I brought up the fact that I swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.
[01:46:18.091 --> 01:46:25.652]  And he also came up with something saying that, okay, well you also swore to obey the orders of the President of the United States.
[01:46:26.553 --> 01:46:32.954]  And I pointed out the fact to him that my oath says to obey the orders of the President in accordance with law.
[01:46:33.732 --> 01:46:41.547]  Well, I pointed out that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and anything that violates the Constitution, any orders, obviously unconstitutional.
[01:46:42.409 --> 01:46:44.894]  And this guy was a lawyer, okay?
[01:46:44.954 --> 01:46:45.756]  And he told me that...
[01:46:46.522 --> 01:46:49.503]  Yeah, he told me that the law was there to go around it.
[01:46:52.425 --> 01:46:59.047]  It's to circumvent your constitutional rights, and to circumvent the Bill of Rights.
[01:46:59.107 --> 01:47:00.048]  It always is that way.
[01:47:00.088 --> 01:47:03.229]  It's always to try to put you under a new mode of control.
[01:47:03.269 --> 01:47:03.669]  Continue.
[01:47:04.670 --> 01:47:05.150]  Exactly.
[01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:10.572]  So I told him I didn't want to be in the military because it was a violation of not only my oath, but the Constitution.
[01:47:11.333 --> 01:47:12.213]  And he wrote all this down.
[01:47:12.273 --> 01:47:14.394]  It's supposed to go to the Adjutant General of the State of Oregon.
[01:47:15.137 --> 01:47:25.686]  But the fact of the matter is that it's just... There's a lot of people in the military that are beginning to understand what exactly is going on, and I'm working within my own unit to wake people up.
[01:47:25.766 --> 01:47:39.257]  I've woken, I don't know, 10 or 15 people in my unit up to the truth of what's going on, but it's just so difficult with people like this lawyer who believe that the Constitution is not the law and that the President's infallible and can do whatever he wants.
[01:47:40.032 --> 01:47:43.054]  It's absolutely stunning, but that is the mentality.
[01:47:43.074 --> 01:47:45.755]  That's the mentality we've all grown up with, the commander-in-chief.
[01:47:45.795 --> 01:47:46.815]  You should be so honored.
[01:47:47.016 --> 01:47:48.536]  You know, it's like I had McGovern on yesterday.
[01:47:49.017 --> 01:47:59.822]  And McGovern, for conscription, said, well, I hope that if another Hitler arose in the world, that the people of this country would want to have conscription so that we could rise up and fight that leader.
[01:47:59.842 --> 01:48:01.623]  And I thought to myself, well, in actuality,
[01:48:02.163 --> 01:48:05.305]  Hitler never really lost because the people behind him kept power.
[01:48:05.705 --> 01:48:16.371]  We relegated the top Nazis into our scientific programs through Project Paperclip, not just our NASA program which was born out of the Nazis, but our eugenics programs as well.
[01:48:16.391 --> 01:48:17.852]  They were just put under wraps.
[01:48:17.872 --> 01:48:21.274]  So in reality, that threat has never left.
[01:48:22.404 --> 01:48:27.385]  And, you know, the Constitution and Bill of Rights is supposed to protect us from those threats, Bob.
[01:48:27.485 --> 01:48:37.947]  And the reason the lawyers, I hope I don't make any lawyers mad, I don't really care if I do or not, but the reason the lawyers say that, that you can just get around it, is because they don't understand the Constitution.
[01:48:37.967 --> 01:48:46.629]  They were taught in law school that Marbury v. Madison means that the only people who can understand the Constitution is the Supreme Court.
[01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:50.713]  And whatever they say goes, Constitution be darned.
[01:48:51.034 --> 01:48:54.798]  I mean, they think that the Supreme Court is the living end of everything.
[01:48:54.838 --> 01:49:01.285]  They're taught that from day one in law school, but they forgot to read the part in Article, I think it's 3, Section 2, which says that
[01:49:02.186 --> 01:49:02.846]  How you doing, Jason?
[01:49:02.866 --> 01:49:03.367]  Oh, pretty good.
[01:49:03.387 --> 01:49:04.427]  I've been listening to you this week.
[01:49:31.732 --> 01:49:33.073]  I'd like to hear you talk.
[01:49:33.813 --> 01:49:40.476]  I listened to you earlier and you were speaking about going to the legislatures and the county commissioners.
[01:49:41.317 --> 01:49:43.498]  And I think you're just a little out of touch there.
[01:49:43.578 --> 01:49:49.881]  You know, this government as it is, is 110% corrupt from the meter made to the president.
[01:49:49.941 --> 01:49:52.602]  Well, when I was saying that, I was saying we have to run for those positions.
[01:49:52.662 --> 01:50:01.026]  Not so much go and beg for our rights from them, but when that guy was calling up and saying that civil disobedience wasn't the only way, we also had to run for these positions, I agreed.
[01:50:02.079 --> 01:50:03.480]  Yeah, I agree with you there, too.
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:07.563]  I ran for mayor in the town I'm in, and I was a victim of voter fraud.
[01:50:07.783 --> 01:50:08.684]  I had proof of it.
[01:50:08.904 --> 01:50:19.292]  A reporter came over from Method and reported on it, and her report was dunked, and she went to Connecticut, and there was never nothing that could be done about it.
[01:50:19.332 --> 01:50:26.498]  These people are all in it together, and you don't get up to a position of power without becoming corrupt.
[01:50:27.256 --> 01:50:37.262]  And I don't know what the answer is to defeating his people, but I know it isn't going to the people who are oppressing you and trying to stop you.
[01:50:37.282 --> 01:50:37.762]  Well, I agree.
[01:50:37.782 --> 01:50:40.504]  I don't think we should be begging our oppressors for our God-given rights.
[01:50:40.564 --> 01:50:41.605]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:41.625 --> 01:50:43.786]  We'll be back for the final segment after this.
[01:50:43.846 --> 01:50:46.708]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:54.153 --> 01:50:57.534]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:57.674 --> 01:51:02.895]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:51:03.075 --> 01:51:07.856]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:51:08.216 --> 01:51:19.339]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:51:19.739 --> 01:51:25.285]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:51:25.525 --> 01:51:31.591]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:31.791 --> 01:51:32.451]  What about you?

[01:51:58.084 --> 01:52:02.784]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:52:02.984 --> 01:52:05.785]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:52:05.805 --> 01:52:08.065]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:52:08.586 --> 01:52:10.986]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:11.761 --> 01:52:19.086]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:22.107 --> 01:52:27.091]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:27.551 --> 01:52:30.953]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[01:54:10.708 --> 01:54:13.813]  Bottles to my trade Many a soldier shed his life load on my blade
[01:54:22.382 --> 01:54:31.485]  I want to remind everybody HeartlandEmergency.com, that's HeartlandEmergency.com, is putting on three seminars out here in Texas.
[01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:35.786]  First one is going to be Friday at 6 over at Fredericksburg.
[01:54:35.846 --> 01:54:42.388]  They're going to include speakers like Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, and the Freeze Dry Guy.
[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:47.862]  So these are going to be fun seminars, lots of education going on.
[01:54:47.922 --> 01:54:49.543]  Friday night, January 6th, 6 p.m.
[01:54:49.563 --> 01:54:51.565]  in Fredericksburg, or at 2 p.m.
[01:54:51.625 --> 01:54:56.288]  on Saturday and Sunday over at Brave New Books here in Austin on 1904 Guadalupe Street.
[01:54:56.328 --> 01:54:57.609]  The phone number is 512-921-9015.
[01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:58.529]  512-921-9015.
[01:54:58.990 --> 01:55:06.975]  Alright, let's see how many calls we can go through in the last couple minutes here.
[01:55:07.055 --> 01:55:13.479]  I am Jason Vermas, riding shotgun with Bob Dacey here in the InfoWarrior office, the InfoWarrior studio.
[01:55:13.519 --> 01:55:14.140]  Gotta love it in here.
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:18.221]  All right, let's go to John in New Jersey, who's a cop.
[01:55:18.281 --> 01:55:19.702]  So, John, what's on your mind?
[01:55:21.782 --> 01:55:22.302]  John, you with us?
[01:55:23.002 --> 01:55:23.623]  Yes, Jason.
[01:55:23.963 --> 01:55:24.283]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:24.823 --> 01:55:25.483]  Yes, how you doing, buddy?
[01:55:25.503 --> 01:55:28.044]  I was on a couple of weeks ago with Alex.
[01:55:28.564 --> 01:55:29.044]  Excellent.
[01:55:29.384 --> 01:55:31.265]  Yeah, I'm a first responder, 9-11 guy.
[01:55:32.305 --> 01:55:35.326]  And I just wanted to thank all your listeners.
[01:55:35.366 --> 01:55:37.587]  I got so many good responses after that.
[01:55:37.607 --> 01:55:38.847]  It was amazing.
[01:55:39.147 --> 01:55:40.167]  Yes, it was amazing.
[01:55:40.567 --> 01:55:42.208]  And the other knucklehead that just called in,
[01:55:43.044 --> 01:55:43.205]  It's
[01:55:56.304 --> 01:56:01.468]  My brother is also a police officer in Jersey City and also a first-time respondent.
[01:56:01.528 --> 01:56:03.050]  He's running for political office.
[01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:04.671]  He shares the same agenda.
[01:56:05.271 --> 01:56:06.072]  Excellent, man.
[01:56:06.092 --> 01:56:09.355]  See, that gives me, that's very heartening towards me because we just have a call.
[01:56:09.395 --> 01:56:10.796]  Don't go to the legislators.
[01:56:11.016 --> 01:56:17.681]  Listen, I'm not saying beg for your rights from these people, but when they first ask them and then, or he's really not asking them, say what you want.
[01:56:18.522 --> 01:56:19.343]  You demand your rights.
[01:56:19.983 --> 01:56:29.407]  And then when they say no, no, no, no, no, then run against them, take them, and then give all those other people that were in your situation only months or years ago their rights back.
[01:56:29.687 --> 01:56:31.028]  I mean, that's how we're going to take it over.
[01:56:31.068 --> 01:56:32.469]  I mean, it's slowly but surely.
[01:56:32.769 --> 01:56:39.552]  It's people like you and your brother taking charge, running for office, and really trying to take back the Constitution and Bill of Rights, John.
[01:56:40.472 --> 01:56:44.854]  Jason, and you know, essentially at the end of the day, we have to stop
[01:56:45.737 --> 01:56:47.498]  Referring to things as privileges.
[01:56:48.298 --> 01:56:49.519]  Most things are rights.
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:51.300]  Most things.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:57:02.665]  There are certain things that could be legally perceived, even on an idealistic sense, you could say, okay, well, they're, they could be, you know, perceived as privileges, but these are all rights.
[01:57:02.805 --> 01:57:04.466]  They'll, they'll, they'll refer to as a license.
[01:57:04.546 --> 01:57:05.707]  I'm a cop for 15 years.
[01:57:06.747 --> 01:57:08.868]  You know, these are, these are privileges.
[01:57:08.908 --> 01:57:11.709]  Having a right to drive a car is not a privilege.
[01:57:12.190 --> 01:57:12.670]  It's your right.
[01:57:14.698 --> 01:57:19.621]  You can go to info from whatever location you need to go to.
[01:57:19.662 --> 01:57:20.802]  I know you're running out of time.
[01:57:21.183 --> 01:57:23.765]  I just want to put up my brother's website.
[01:57:23.785 --> 01:57:27.267]  It's going to be jimcarroll.com.
[01:57:28.108 --> 01:57:29.249]  He's running with Lou Manzo.
[01:57:29.289 --> 01:57:33.372]  If you could speak to anybody, any Jersey City listeners that can come out and help.
[01:57:34.474 --> 01:57:37.655]  We do have a big viewership over in New York City and in Jersey City.
[01:57:37.695 --> 01:57:41.856]  I actually just got a text from one of my friends over in Jersey City telling me a plane went down in the Hudson.
[01:57:41.876 --> 01:57:43.236]  I'm going to have to check that out.
[01:57:43.336 --> 01:57:48.798]  But please, listen, all you listeners out there down in the city area, help this man, help his brother get elected.
[01:57:48.838 --> 01:57:49.878]  That's how we're going to do it, Bob.
[01:57:50.118 --> 01:57:52.579]  We're going to elect each other into office.
[01:57:52.619 --> 01:57:55.499]  We're going to take the Constitution and Bill of Rights and we're going to bring them back.
[01:57:55.939 --> 01:57:56.840]  We're bringing it back!
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:02.141]  The concept of rights as privileges comes straight out of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the UN.
[01:58:02.481 --> 01:58:13.909]  If you missed any of this, you know, really world-class broadcast today with Bob Dacey and Jason Bermas, you can listen to the entire thing over at InfoWars.com, where we replay all four hours, 24-7.
[01:58:14.189 --> 01:58:16.071]  You actually get the show six times a day, folks.
[01:58:16.631 --> 01:58:22.795]  And that takes a little scratch, a little capital, so we hope you become a PrisonPlanet.tv member, or get a copy of Fabled Enemies.
[01:58:23.396 --> 01:58:24.076]  God bless you all.
[01:58:24.096 --> 01:58:25.057]  It's the Alex Jones Show.

[01:58:50.087 --> 01:58:52.829]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[01:58:53.049 --> 01:58:55.910]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:58:56.090 --> 01:59:00.793]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:01.033 --> 01:59:01.954]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:02.154 --> 01:59:05.076]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:05.396 --> 01:59:12.300]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
