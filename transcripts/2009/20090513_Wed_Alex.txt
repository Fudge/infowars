[00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:04.518]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:18.585]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv, now simulcasting for the final two hours of this four-hour transmission.
[00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.386]  I am here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:21.906]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:22.767]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:25.028]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:25.448]  Eastern.
[00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:27.968]  And we appreciate everybody joining us.
[00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:32.869]  I'm finishing up with the editor and writer at Infowars.com, Kurt Nimmo.
[00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.091]  Great political mind and researcher.
[00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.692]  Believe me, we've looked for folks that can work in our operation.
[00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:40.592]  There are few and far between.
[00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:41.313]  Kurt's one of them.
[00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:46.275]  Other folks seem to always have flaws or blind spots when it comes to researching the New World Order.
[00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:51.076]  I'm sad to say I wish our numbers were greater of those that have a really deep understanding.
[00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:52.217]  And, of course, another person I
[00:00:52.757 --> 00:00:59.601]  Found out there who I, for years, watched and researched and decided to be a member of the team and we're honored to have him, Paul Watson, now for six years.
[00:01:00.262 --> 00:01:05.125]  And he runs PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv with his brother, Steve Watson, and also does a fine job.
[00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.047]  Finishing up in this segment, the next, and I got another guest coming on.
[00:01:09.087 --> 00:01:10.208]  I appreciate your time, gentlemen.
[00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:20.635]  Paul Watson, I want to shift gears now into, because if we just cover this by itself, it doesn't bring the full import of what we're facing.
[00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:23.543]  They are creating class warfare in Envy.
[00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:26.647]  And in the US, in England, they have similar programs.
[00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:29.009]  They say, does your neighbor look like they have more money than they should?
[00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.751]  Find out what job they've got.
[00:01:30.892 --> 00:01:32.854]  Ask them what their salary is and call police.
[00:01:33.214 --> 00:01:42.405]  You'll get a percentage of anything seized from black market business, garage sale money, coin collections they've sold, drugs, you know.
[00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:46.486]  And this is all under Homeland Security here and in England.
[00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:50.427]  They're taking the anti-terrorist system they've set up and the spy networks.
[00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:57.570]  They sell the public on, we're going to have spies, we need citizens tattling, we're listening to your phones without warrants, but it's to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.011]  You don't want Al-Qaeda to attack, do you?
[00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.531]  You saw 7-7, you saw 9-11.
[00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:02.552]  Now they just admit, here in the U.S.
[00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:06.013]  and overseas, spy on your neighbors, spy on gun owners.
[00:02:06.473 --> 00:02:10.295]  If your neighbor has a gun, call the police on them, the billboards say, when the guns aren't illegal.
[00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:12.516]  I mean, it's getting bad.
[00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:17.197]  Guys, pull this up on screen for folks that are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:18.077 --> 00:02:22.039]  It says, a police encouraged citizens to report people who drive nice cars.
[00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.480]  I want them to see the picture of the police chiefs and people smiling like criminals.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.141]  And they know this is asinine.
[00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.541]  It's a big joke to them.
[00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:32.042]  If you criticize open borders, you'll be arrested.
[00:02:34.963 --> 00:02:40.785]  It shows on here a poster of a guy in a suit saying, too much bling, give us a ring.
[00:02:41.618 --> 00:02:45.780]  And it says, bling, call the police immediately if your neighbor has a boat or a nice car.
[00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.302]  It says, in this recession, you're not supposed to have money.
[00:02:49.582 --> 00:02:51.843]  Paul Watson, this is creating class warfare.
[00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:52.743]  This is communism.
[00:02:53.024 --> 00:02:54.084]  This is what the Reds did.
[00:02:54.124 --> 00:02:55.045]  They said, arrest your neighbor.
[00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:55.665]  He's rich.
[00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:56.085]  Get him.
[00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:58.326]  I mean, Paul, it's happening.
[00:02:58.466 --> 00:02:59.467]  I can't even believe this.
[00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:06.710]  Well, top political scientists are now just saying that the UK is a totalitarian state.
[00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.031]  There's no doubt about it anymore.
[00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:22.773]  And this is a campaign by Gloucestershire Police Force, who incidentally were the same police force who arrested Robin Page for saying that farming groups should have the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:32.398]  They're also the same police force that set up Operation Napkin, which is where they sent out police officers to sit in curry houses and
[00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:41.815]  Who is this demon in the middle?
[00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:46.675]  I mean, he looks like the epitome of a thug, of a jackboot.
[00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:53.337]  I mean, that guy would be, if I was a big filmmaker making a new 1984, he would be an inter-party official.
[00:03:53.677 --> 00:04:00.818]  I mean, I would come to him and say, we want to cast you as a piece of absolute, degenerate, parasitical trash.
[00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:05.103]  It looks like the chief constable to me, but I'm not sure.
[00:04:05.543 --> 00:04:15.870]  But yeah, it's a campaign put out by the police, which encourages people to report on other citizens who drive nice cars or buy expensive items.
[00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.011]  This is just meant to get everybody tattling on everybody.
[00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:18.691]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:19.372]  One more segment.
[00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.953]  I want to get Kurt Nemo's take on this.
[00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.354]  And they're doing the same stuff here.
[00:04:23.014 --> 00:04:27.077]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, they are moving on everybody full force.
[00:04:27.537 --> 00:04:30.920]  They're not just saying Michael Savage will be arrested if he comes to England.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.962]  I mean, they're going after me.
[00:04:33.262 --> 00:04:34.903]  They're shutting me off everywhere.
[00:04:34.923 --> 00:04:41.769]  I mean, we're under attack because these people mean to make us their slaves, and they know that some of us aren't going along with it.
[00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:42.610]  You're a punk.
[00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:50.898]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:04:51.138 --> 00:04:55.442]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:04:55.703 --> 00:05:00.807]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:05:01.308 --> 00:05:08.375]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:13.777]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[00:05:14.217 --> 00:05:19.678]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:05:20.058 --> 00:05:25.520]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.566]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[00:05:31.807 --> 00:05:34.309]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:49.683]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:57.206]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:03.985]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:06.187]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:06.327 --> 00:06:08.749]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:19.779]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.701]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:23.443]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:30.243]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:38.630]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.251]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:40.672 --> 00:06:41.873]  The people strike back.
[00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:44.201]  You worry.
[00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:46.422]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:06:46.702 --> 00:06:46.982]  Hi.
[00:06:47.242 --> 00:06:49.743]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:06:50.023 --> 00:06:54.285]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:56.766]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:06:57.046 --> 00:07:00.107]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.108]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:04.849]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.530]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.872]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:17.033]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:23.335]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:25.796]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:07:26.016 --> 00:07:27.697]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:32.338]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:07:32.798 --> 00:07:33.439]  Start now.
[00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:34.659]  Knowledge is power.
[00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:36.220]  Better take action.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.380]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:49.314]  Yeah, Viggo Mortensen.
[00:07:49.874 --> 00:07:50.916]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:52.758]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.220]  You want answers?
[00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:55.902]  Well so does he.
[00:07:55.922 --> 00:08:00.208]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:04.774]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:06.298 --> 00:08:12.159]  Viggo Mortensen and a lot of other folks are in the film and is reclaiming the blade.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:25.762]  And we are going to have Daniel McNichol, the filmmaker, on to talk about it because it gets into how the general public was disarmed.
[00:08:25.782 --> 00:08:33.504]  It gets into how the right to keep and bear arms is very important and how swordplay is coming back into the culture.
[00:08:34.204 --> 00:08:42.986]  And by the way, you know, there's a joke, they could disarm us, but if we had knives, which everybody does, you could, you know, get a weapon, get a firearm very, very quickly.
[00:08:43.366 --> 00:08:46.007]  So it is good to know how to use a knife or a sword.
[00:08:46.027 --> 00:08:48.247]  And it's a lot of fun.
[00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:50.448]  So I'm interested a little bit in it.
[00:08:51.308 --> 00:08:54.729]  And so we're going to be, we're going to be going over that.
[00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:58.577]  Can somebody email me and tell me how to get rid of fruit flies?
[00:08:58.857 --> 00:09:01.763]  There's no food, there's no water, there's nothing open around the office.
[00:09:02.485 --> 00:09:03.707]  And it just gets worse and worse.
[00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:07.534]  Earlier I was ranting and raving in the first hour and one flew in my mouth and into my, you know.
[00:09:08.507 --> 00:09:10.688]  You ever been riding a bicycle and those little gnats go in your throat?
[00:09:11.188 --> 00:09:14.949]  You open the front door out there and there's just millions of them, you know, they're flying around in swarms.
[00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:24.593]  They got in the office and, I don't know if you can see them flying by, it's like, there went one, I mean, I can barely keep my focus.
[00:09:24.953 --> 00:09:26.134]  They're landing on my nose.
[00:09:27.274 --> 00:09:28.375]  The battle continues though.
[00:09:29.616 --> 00:09:30.917]  We're in here defeating him, hopefully.
[00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:32.178]  All right, I'm going to shut up about that.
[00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:34.900]  Kurt Nemo, you hear what Paul Watson is talking about.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.001]  We're going to go back to him in a moment.
[00:09:36.101 --> 00:09:37.862]  But this is happening everywhere.
[00:09:37.902 --> 00:09:39.924]  This is to get everybody to tattle on everybody.
[00:09:40.685 --> 00:09:43.026]  You read all these federal reports here in the U.S.
[00:09:43.046 --> 00:09:45.769]  They're identical to the ones in England and Canada and Germany and Europe.
[00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:47.790]  It's, does your neighbor have a cell phone?
[00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.071]  Are they nice to police?
[00:09:49.491 --> 00:09:51.113]  Do they want to be involved in community stuff?
[00:09:51.433 --> 00:09:53.555]  They're probably a secret right-wing terrorist.
[00:09:54.637 --> 00:10:07.350]  And now they're announcing restrictions on free speech, and anybody in the DHS reports listed as extremists won't be able to own guns, exactly what White House Chief of Staff said in speeches, and still the public can't believe it.
[00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.351]  I can't believe it.
[00:10:08.711 --> 00:10:18.600]  I mean, we knew they were going to set this up, but to have them coming right out and going, yeah, we're going to take your free speech and take your guns, I mean, without a judge or jury, and then now in England,
[00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:22.542]  Report your neighbor if they smoke cigars or wear a suit and tie.
[00:10:22.923 --> 00:10:25.604]  It says they shouldn't have that much money in this recession.
[00:10:26.064 --> 00:10:28.645]  Get money from the government to start spying on your neighbor.
[00:10:29.185 --> 00:10:30.466]  Ask your neighbor's questions.
[00:10:30.886 --> 00:10:32.466]  We're going to go to Paul Watson in a moment.
[00:10:32.827 --> 00:10:34.507]  And at the 20 after, we've got our next guest coming up.
[00:10:34.827 --> 00:10:36.368]  But Kurt Nemo, your take on this.
[00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:45.892]  Well, this is kind of, you know, it reminds me of Orwell's 1984, the junior spies who were spying on Winston Smith, you know, it's the same thing.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.725]  It's a classic attribute of totalitarianism.
[00:10:49.765 --> 00:10:50.886]  It happened in Red China.
[00:10:51.447 --> 00:10:53.169]  It happened with the Hitlerjugend in Germany.
[00:10:53.189 --> 00:10:59.498]  It's a standard procedure, and that's precisely what they're doing.
[00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:02.041]  Class warfare works wonderfully.
[00:11:05.819 --> 00:11:07.663]  You aren't even denying any of this anymore.
[00:11:07.703 --> 00:11:10.828]  We were brought up that China restricted free speech and it was a police state.
[00:11:10.868 --> 00:11:13.513]  We were brought up that Russia did that.
[00:11:14.535 --> 00:11:18.482]  We were brought up that all of this was going on and happening.
[00:11:20.015 --> 00:11:28.737]  And then Chinese-style net censorship, where they block things, block IPs, have firewalls, where they have government gatekeepers.
[00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:45.402]  The New York Times comes out and says we need a kinder, gentler internet that doesn't let the general public blog without licenses, and you'll get felony charges if you hurt someone's feelings, and you'll have to have a subdomain on a bigger domain so you have no rights, and they say we're going to gatekeep and take your free speech for your own interest,
[00:11:45.882 --> 00:11:53.967]  And they're openly phasing in Chinese net style censorship where they're purging all the Alex Jones videos and the media just goes, so what?
[00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:56.649]  Because the old media has to kill us.
[00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.993]  They can't put up with a level playing field because we're telling the truth and they're not.
[00:12:03.094 --> 00:12:09.818]  Yeah, and as well, the corporate structure can't, you know, cotton the fact that Alex Jones is on there talking the truth.
[00:12:09.878 --> 00:12:12.380]  You know, I mean, take a look at what's happening to YouTube.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.141]  It's being, you know, turning into the next
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.869]  Hulu, you know, it's turning into a corporate base for...
[00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:21.451]  For their commercials and their cartoons and their TV shows.
[00:12:21.531 --> 00:12:29.016]  Yeah, well we told people that we've seen this with other web systems and we know the globalist tactics of phasing things in.
[00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:43.965]  And I would go in and we'd write articles where Google, three years ago, put out corporate reports about the model they were going to phase in the next few years and how they were going to get rid of most of the user videos and only have selected people they choose.
[00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:53.394]  They're going to use a very high standard of micromanaging and the contracts you sign digitally to be on there where they can suspend you for no reason.
[00:12:53.994 --> 00:12:55.136]  And that's now happening.
[00:12:55.856 --> 00:12:58.259]  And we told people they were phasing out two years ago.
[00:12:58.299 --> 00:13:00.341]  We said they're starting to phase out Google Video.
[00:13:00.621 --> 00:13:02.082]  Now they've completely phased it out.
[00:13:02.403 --> 00:13:03.544]  No more uploading to it.
[00:13:03.804 --> 00:13:06.026]  They're now doing the same phase out.
[00:13:06.727 --> 00:13:25.562]  The same way they did it, restricting views, knocking channels off, killing or locking down videos when they hit, you know, the top videos, and then turning them back on later when they're out of the top 100, getting rid of the top 100 or most viewed on the front page, making it popular, just what they want to push, relegating user videos to subpages.
[00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:30.567]  The innocuous Pablum stays on there, the Volleyball Girls and all that stuff remains.
[00:13:31.872 --> 00:13:35.295]  Well exactly, but I mean the issue is they really are killing YouTube right now.
[00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:48.289]  I mean they really are shutting it down, they are phasing it out, but they know through domestication tactics of mind control, same way you domesticate a horse or a cow or a pig or a dog, they are easing us into this, and I tell people, look,
[00:13:48.936 --> 00:14:02.045]  You know, Google admittedly is run by NASA and the NSA, and here's the CIA agent and the founding documents, and they give all their money to eugenics, and here's their own charitable giving, billions a year, and people just say, no, it's not!
[00:14:02.085 --> 00:14:03.106]  It's not happening, Alex!
[00:14:03.346 --> 00:14:04.227]  Don't fear monger!
[00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:10.391]  Paul Watson, I want to get back into this whole Stasi thing, but before we forget, get into this Google situation.
[00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:12.653]  Well, that's right.
[00:14:12.693 --> 00:14:16.776]  The other day, Google officially suspended all video uploads.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.461]  Um, they said they were going to do that up to a year ago, I remember them saying that, and they went ahead and did it.
[00:14:24.022 --> 00:14:35.745]  The thing with YouTube is that, um, they now on their News and Politics page, for example, they don't put the videos on there that are watched by the most amount of people.
[00:14:36.245 --> 00:14:37.565]  They select the videos.
[00:14:38.109 --> 00:14:43.191]  And the videos in News and Politics aren't very much different from the ones on the front page.
[00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:46.812]  You know, it's like these drunk footballers staggering around.
[00:14:46.832 --> 00:14:48.012]  That's right.
[00:14:48.532 --> 00:14:52.814]  Every day they post the amazing atheist.
[00:14:53.074 --> 00:14:54.294]  It'll have like 20 views.
[00:14:54.614 --> 00:14:55.394]  They post him.
[00:14:55.715 --> 00:14:57.455]  By the end of the day, he's got 100,000 views.
[00:14:57.735 --> 00:15:02.197]  Meanwhile, we'll have videos that get 300,000 views in a day, never on the front page.
[00:15:02.577 --> 00:15:05.798]  I mean, they admit that they are phasing it all out, folks.
[00:15:05.858 --> 00:15:06.418]  It's happening.
[00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:12.583]  I mean, it's because it's an unsustainable business model.
[00:15:12.743 --> 00:15:25.551]  YouTube are deep in the red, but unlike what would normally happen and that you would take advertising, they're just going to hand over the control of their entire content to these big Hollywood production studios.
[00:15:26.246 --> 00:15:30.830]  When that happens, there's no place on there for the Alex Jones Channel or the Infowarrior.
[00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:35.515]  Look, what they do is they know the model, and I've talked to a lot of CEOs and media people.
[00:15:35.555 --> 00:15:39.218]  They go, Alex, we know you'd be the biggest thing in the country, or anybody else like you.
[00:15:39.498 --> 00:15:42.521]  We know this Patriot anti-New World Order stuff is the hottest thing.
[00:15:42.781 --> 00:15:44.183]  We know the whole world's in rebellion.
[00:15:44.863 --> 00:15:49.527]  And so what they do is they give the people a platform for a time to get us addicted.
[00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:51.732]  And then they just take it away.
[00:15:52.373 --> 00:15:54.033]  They want to dominate market share.
[00:15:54.473 --> 00:15:57.835]  And YouTube is bigger than all other video sharing sites combined.
[00:15:58.115 --> 00:15:59.835]  You can look at the graphs and statistics.
[00:16:00.255 --> 00:16:04.637]  And so they've dominated the market with freedom of speech, and now they're getting rid of it.
[00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:09.098]  And because they're moving in with Internet 2 to shut down the other sites.
[00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:14.020]  They couldn't do that until they were ready to shut down the others, or everybody would just leave.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.662]  That's my point, is they're moving in with what Jay Rockefeller said, shutting down the web.
[00:16:18.702 --> 00:16:19.122]  Go ahead, Paul.
[00:16:20.407 --> 00:16:28.614]  That's right and I mean Rupert Murdoch said it a few days ago that the internet in its current form cannot go on.
[00:16:28.634 --> 00:16:35.200]  He said it's going to end because they've lost a huge amount of their audience.
[00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:38.083]  I'm talking about people like News Corporation with
[00:16:38.638 --> 00:16:42.720]  Fox News and New York Post and newspapers like that.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.542]  And again, these people mean business.
[00:16:45.582 --> 00:16:48.403]  They do everything they say they're going to do, or they try it.
[00:16:48.743 --> 00:16:49.624]  And they never quit.
[00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:50.604]  They come back again and again.
[00:16:50.624 --> 00:16:59.609]  They're saying everywhere for seven years at Internet2 conferences in Austin, Texas and London and Tokyo, read the minutes, they are going to kill the web and how they do it.
[00:17:00.009 --> 00:17:01.550]  And I told you how they do it!
[00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.611]  People, oh shut up Alex!
[00:17:03.911 --> 00:17:05.532]  Look, it's happening folks.
[00:17:06.332 --> 00:17:07.474]  I'm sorry, Paul, to interrupt you.
[00:17:07.514 --> 00:17:08.755]  I'm just so angry about this.
[00:17:10.357 --> 00:17:16.004]  No, I mean, we said it all in early 2006, right when Myspace was taking off.
[00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:18.707]  We wrote an article saying it's a Trojan horse.
[00:17:18.947 --> 00:17:22.832]  It's designed to centralize power on the Internet, get everybody to
[00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:33.281]  Use MySpace as their little blog, and so, you know, when MySpace says that you can't have this political opinion or that political opinion, that's it, your account's suspended.
[00:17:33.642 --> 00:17:36.905]  And we have their own internal documents, and they've admitted I am banned.
[00:17:36.925 --> 00:17:39.108]  They don't let me send our bulletins or videos.
[00:17:39.368 --> 00:17:40.349]  They let us have the page.
[00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.512]  We know we really have hundreds of thousands of members.
[00:17:42.532 --> 00:17:43.293]  They've frozen us at 55,000.
[00:17:44.594 --> 00:17:45.435]  And they admit they do it.
[00:17:45.475 --> 00:17:47.396]  We have their own moderators going, yeah, you're banned.
[00:17:47.797 --> 00:17:50.779]  Prison Planet and Infowars are not allowed to be shared on Myspace.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.941]  Then they lie to the public, though, and say they're not doing it.
[00:17:54.382 --> 00:17:56.563]  Meanwhile, in England, Paul, you were trying to finish up.
[00:17:56.583 --> 00:17:58.144]  I'm going to have to hold you guys over again.
[00:17:58.184 --> 00:17:58.865]  Move the guests back.
[00:17:58.905 --> 00:17:59.966]  I apologize to the guests.
[00:18:00.006 --> 00:18:01.427]  I really love the movie, and we're going to plug it.
[00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:03.789]  I've got to finish up with five more minutes with you guys.
[00:18:06.055 --> 00:18:09.117]  We've got to fight this, and that's why I tell my listeners, use YouTube.
[00:18:09.157 --> 00:18:10.298]  Well, you can't use Google.
[00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:12.780]  I kept saying, use Google before they shut down Google Video.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.281]  Gone.
[00:18:13.881 --> 00:18:14.542]  Use YouTube.
[00:18:14.622 --> 00:18:18.124]  I'd say we're six months out from complete control unless we fight it.
[00:18:18.144 --> 00:18:21.047]  If there's enough of a rebellion, they may back off.
[00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:24.670]  And Doppelganger, copy all our videos to every other major video site.
[00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:25.750]  Blip.tv, you name it.
[00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:28.172]  But folks, we've got to do this now.
[00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:29.473]  Who are they censoring?
[00:18:29.553 --> 00:18:29.814]  Me.
[00:18:30.074 --> 00:18:30.914]  Because we're effective.
[00:18:30.954 --> 00:18:31.375]  Curt Nemo.
[00:18:32.031 --> 00:18:38.697]  Well, they don't have the resources as well to stop people from uploading unless they ban uploading altogether like Google plans to do.
[00:18:40.398 --> 00:18:45.082]  So people can go in there and post your videos and it's kind of like whack-a-mole to them.
[00:18:45.102 --> 00:18:50.047]  They're going to have to keep trying to get rid of them and it's going to be hard to do until they totally ban
[00:18:50.734 --> 00:18:53.096]  You know, like Google has, any kind of upload.
[00:18:53.236 --> 00:18:53.717]  Exactly.
[00:18:54.377 --> 00:18:55.879]  My point is, we are now here.
[00:18:56.279 --> 00:19:03.285]  They're now announcing that they've got bills introduced that will say you'll be a felony arrested if you criticize someone and they say they hurt their feelings.
[00:19:03.546 --> 00:19:05.227]  They sign an affidavit saying my feelings are hurt.
[00:19:05.788 --> 00:19:08.390]  Five years in prison, $200,000 fine, federal prison.
[00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:09.411]  Mainstream!
[00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:10.952]  They got bills to ban guns.
[00:19:11.172 --> 00:19:11.773]  Mainstream!
[00:19:11.953 --> 00:19:16.237]  The Attorney General saying if I don't like you, you won't own a gun and you'll never be able to get off the list.
[00:19:16.397 --> 00:19:16.918]  Mainstream!
[00:19:17.518 --> 00:19:20.660]  I mean, you know, 14 plus trillion stolen in seven months.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.561]  Mainstream.
[00:19:22.341 --> 00:19:23.522]  FEMA camps being built.
[00:19:23.882 --> 00:19:24.543]  Mainstream.
[00:19:25.223 --> 00:19:29.466]  I mean, it's all... They're taking over now.
[00:19:29.927 --> 00:19:32.368]  And they're going to kill the web as you know it.
[00:19:33.569 --> 00:19:34.910]  That's why we're on AM and FM.
[00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:35.410]  Shortwave.
[00:19:35.671 --> 00:19:38.112]  But they're saying they're going to censor with Fairness Doctrine that.
[00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:40.794]  That's why we got DVDs.
[00:19:41.255 --> 00:19:42.776]  But I may get arrested, folks.
[00:19:42.856 --> 00:19:43.036]  I mean...
[00:19:43.823 --> 00:19:48.927]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:19:49.207 --> 00:19:57.492]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:19:57.773 --> 00:20:01.075]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:04.297]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:20:04.577 --> 00:20:06.699]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:09.781]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[00:20:36.122 --> 00:20:41.547]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:20:50.354 --> 00:20:58.120]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:06.346]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:06.646 --> 00:21:11.410]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.454]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:16.954 --> 00:21:20.817]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:21.297 --> 00:21:22.318]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:22.398 --> 00:21:26.481]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:34.344]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:21:36.806 --> 00:21:40.189]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:55.067]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:21:55.588 --> 00:22:01.790]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.911]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:04.071 --> 00:22:06.452]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:22:06.532 --> 00:22:17.417]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:20.969]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.791]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:23.232 --> 00:22:29.578]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:30.139 --> 00:22:37.926]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:38.407 --> 00:22:39.568]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:39.988 --> 00:22:41.190]  The people strike back.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.864]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:22:48.904 --> 00:22:49.424]  and the world.
[00:22:49.704 --> 00:22:53.147]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:22:53.547 --> 00:22:59.791]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:23:00.051 --> 00:23:01.832]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:23:02.093 --> 00:23:07.176]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[00:23:07.216 --> 00:23:07.576]  I think so.

[00:23:47.771 --> 00:23:51.234]  At the end of the show today, I'm going to announce two new films.
[00:23:51.995 --> 00:23:53.076]  That's a little surprise.
[00:23:53.216 --> 00:23:57.760]  Two new films that we've made in the last month here.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.961]  Very quietly.
[00:24:01.664 --> 00:24:03.365]  So that's coming up at the end of the show today.
[00:24:03.605 --> 00:24:05.847]  The next segment, Reclaiming the Blade.
[00:24:05.887 --> 00:24:08.009]  Amazing film.
[00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.072]  This sucker, just can't put it down.
[00:24:12.093 --> 00:24:13.755]  And no, we're not selling it, but we ought to.
[00:24:15.166 --> 00:24:16.186]  Uh, so that's coming up.
[00:24:16.926 --> 00:24:20.067]  And your calls continually in the last hour, just blitzing your phone calls.
[00:24:21.687 --> 00:24:25.468]  Here's, uh, one of the new, new films.
[00:24:26.288 --> 00:24:26.348]  Ah!
[00:24:26.368 --> 00:24:29.109]  I'm going to be showing that to folks later at the end of the show.
[00:24:29.729 --> 00:24:31.229]  So, uh, wait for that surprise.
[00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.290]  Very proud of my crew and what they've done, everybody here, together.
[00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:42.092]  Okay, in closing, I'm obnoxious and I'm not letting Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson talk, because everything they say freaks me out and makes me want to expose more stuff I'm thinking of.
[00:24:43.032 --> 00:24:46.215]  Because it's so incredible that we're actually going into real tyranny.
[00:24:47.035 --> 00:25:01.627]  Paul Watson closing comments on the censorship, the attack on free speech, England saying spy on your neighbors if they're wearing nice jewelry, they show a picture of a guy with a boat in his yard and say call the cops if your neighbor has things that are nice, ask them questions about what they make.
[00:25:02.108 --> 00:25:07.272]  I mean, you know, they've done the bait and switch from this is for terrorism to this is for tax collection.
[00:25:07.632 --> 00:25:08.393]  This is getting bad.
[00:25:09.894 --> 00:25:11.876]  They're basically trying to get the population
[00:25:12.455 --> 00:25:18.857]  All suspicious of each other and so, you know, it creates a kind of self-regulation of the Stasi police state.
[00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:29.140]  The previous poster campaigns put out by the London Metropolitan Police say that the people who look at CCTV cameras are suspicious.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:38.603]  People that own mobile phones, computers, white vans, and people who live in apartments are suspicious and potentially terrorists.
[00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:46.438]  People who return items bought at a store and get a refund on their credit card are potential terrorists.
[00:25:46.998 --> 00:25:48.219]  And the list goes on and on.
[00:25:48.259 --> 00:25:50.160]  We've got a link to those previous articles.
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:26:00.784]  So, basically they're just classifying the whole population as potential terrorists so that everybody watches and informs on each other and creates this starzy state that they want.
[00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:09.099]  Well, that was certainly well said, and again, this isn't close to classical hardcore tyranny.
[00:26:09.139 --> 00:26:11.079]  This is overblown.
[00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:13.680]  I mean, this is the real McCoy.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:14.940]  This was wrestling.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.820]  This is The Rock.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.341]  This is Hulk Hogan.
[00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:21.342]  This is, you know, Andre the Giant.
[00:26:21.522 --> 00:26:24.583]  I mean, this is Hitler level.
[00:26:25.643 --> 00:26:26.923]  This is Stalin level.
[00:26:26.943 --> 00:26:29.164]  This is Mao level, what they're attempting.
[00:26:29.184 --> 00:26:29.844]  There's no doubt.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.100]  Okay.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.861]  Folks, I'm not just saying that.
[00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:35.482]  We didn't just say this was an engineered flu virus.
[00:26:35.542 --> 00:26:36.162]  It's now come out.
[00:26:36.202 --> 00:26:36.942]  It clearly was.
[00:26:37.423 --> 00:26:37.943]  Curt Nemo.
[00:26:38.743 --> 00:26:55.150]  And as well, this whole paranoia, this social paranoia they're engendering, you know, complements their electronic police state that they're putting in, you know, where everything you do, every website you go to, every credit card transaction you make, every cell phone call you make is put into a database.
[00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:57.711]  So, you know, this complements that as well.
[00:26:57.791 --> 00:26:58.671]  And, you know, it's just
[00:26:59.272 --> 00:27:00.572]  It's just the next level up.
[00:27:00.592 --> 00:27:01.613]  They're ranching up.
[00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:04.473]  And what's going on in England is going to end up coming here sooner or later.
[00:27:04.493 --> 00:27:05.233]  No, it's already here.
[00:27:05.273 --> 00:27:14.536]  Remember a year ago when they announced huge cash bonuses for tattling on your neighbors and spies to spy for the IRS and that the IRS no longer has to have warrants?
[00:27:14.916 --> 00:27:19.077]  And then it was going to increase its enforcers, but only on blue collar and middle class.
[00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:19.977]  None.
[00:27:20.257 --> 00:27:22.218]  Literally almost none for the rich.
[00:27:22.778 --> 00:27:24.678]  It's really in your face over there.
[00:27:24.698 --> 00:27:27.779]  They've got posters and stuff, you know, where they're telling you to spy on your neighbors.
[00:27:28.459 --> 00:27:29.020]  No, I know.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.040]  I agree with you, Kurt.
[00:27:30.681 --> 00:27:31.001]  I agree.
[00:27:31.041 --> 00:27:32.482]  I mean, England's about three or four years ahead of us.
[00:27:32.923 --> 00:27:34.864]  Watson, you've got to get out of there as bad as the U.S.
[00:27:34.944 --> 00:27:35.064]  is.
[00:27:35.084 --> 00:27:36.165]  You've got to get over here, bro.
[00:27:36.565 --> 00:27:39.568]  I mean, that place, they're now announcing they're going to arrest everybody.
[00:27:39.968 --> 00:27:41.369]  This is out of the Wisconsin News.
[00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:45.472]  Court rules, secret GPS tracking without a warrant is now illegal.
[00:27:45.892 --> 00:27:48.775]  And they say no more warrants for cops to stick GPS on your car.
[00:27:49.575 --> 00:27:51.777]  On top of that, England has announced what we said.
[00:27:52.057 --> 00:27:56.921]  Not only will satellite tracker boxes be in all your cars, taxing you by the mile, up to a pound a mile.
[00:27:57.161 --> 00:27:59.623]  That's two dollars a mile, basically, or almost two dollars.
[00:28:00.343 --> 00:28:05.747]  They're now announcing it will regulate and control your car's speed with automatic shut-off for the police.
[00:28:06.047 --> 00:28:07.028]  That's BBC!
[00:28:07.288 --> 00:28:09.349]  I mean, and they're now announcing it here!
[00:28:09.369 --> 00:28:13.813]  I mean, my God, the government remote-controlling your car is big brother, folks!
[00:28:14.253 --> 00:28:15.814]  Cameras in school bathrooms!
[00:28:16.274 --> 00:28:18.056]  I mean, that's why I'm... Paul Watson!
[00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:23.523]  Well, the good news is, Alex, the harder they push, the more people see what's happening around them.
[00:28:23.923 --> 00:28:29.026]  Case in point, regarding the Internet again, Lycos.com.
[00:28:29.406 --> 00:28:30.826]  Top 50 searches.
[00:28:31.327 --> 00:28:35.369]  You've got Facebook, Wikipedia, Drudge Report, Twitter.
[00:28:35.929 --> 00:28:36.909]  Who else is on there?
[00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.672]  Alex Jones, InfoWars, GCN Live, Steve Quayle,
[00:28:43.283 --> 00:28:48.285]  So, we're in the top 50 searches with Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia.
[00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:50.686]  Wait a minute, we don't even toot our own horns!
[00:28:51.026 --> 00:28:54.208]  You're telling me that we're in the top 50 searches now?
[00:28:54.588 --> 00:28:58.510]  It's not Janet Jackson or Anna Nicole Smith, it's us?
[00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.691]  Exactly, on lycoff.com.
[00:29:01.851 --> 00:29:03.112]  I've got the screenshots.
[00:29:03.752 --> 00:29:04.752]  Hey, I like that.
[00:29:06.313 --> 00:29:08.534]  No wonder the enemy is becoming upset.
[00:29:08.554 --> 00:29:10.735]  The Emperor's going, we have a new enemy.
[00:29:11.383 --> 00:29:17.024]  Defeat Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, and Obi-Wan Alex Jones immediately.
[00:29:17.924 --> 00:29:22.745]  Hey guys, look, regardless we're going up against hardcore thugs and tyrants.
[00:29:23.165 --> 00:29:24.105]  It's one hell of a fight.
[00:29:24.165 --> 00:29:25.445]  Isn't life exciting though, men?
[00:29:25.785 --> 00:29:26.966]  Is life not exciting, men?
[00:29:27.406 --> 00:29:27.646]  Yeah.
[00:29:28.006 --> 00:29:30.366]  Let me hear your war growl, both of ya!
[00:29:34.327 --> 00:29:35.227]  We're on the march.
[00:29:35.727 --> 00:29:37.327]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:38.247 --> 00:29:40.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:43.854 --> 00:29:45.416]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:29:45.536 --> 00:29:50.143]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:29:50.283 --> 00:29:53.047]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:29:53.247 --> 00:29:56.111]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:29:56.291 --> 00:30:00.998]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:30:01.218 --> 00:30:02.159]  If you simply prepare.
[00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:05.321]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:30:05.601 --> 00:30:12.505]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[00:30:12.585 --> 00:30:15.727]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:30:15.867 --> 00:30:17.748]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com

[00:30:32.582 --> 00:30:33.003]  Take action today.
[00:30:33.023 --> 00:30:34.845]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:30:44.355 --> 00:30:49.684]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:30:50.185 --> 00:30:57.158]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:30:57.759 --> 00:31:03.943]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:04.263 --> 00:31:06.164]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:06.324 --> 00:31:08.746]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:08.826 --> 00:31:19.773]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:20.393 --> 00:31:21.674]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:22.074 --> 00:31:23.415]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:23.917 --> 00:31:30.245]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:30.825 --> 00:31:38.615]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:39.095 --> 00:31:40.237]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:40.677 --> 00:31:41.839]  The people strike back.
[00:31:43.775 --> 00:31:53.863]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:31:54.343 --> 00:31:55.404]  Garden in a Can!

[00:32:50.743 --> 00:32:57.845]  Yeah, watching this here at the office, it is like Discovery or History Channel or Nova quality.
[00:32:58.145 --> 00:33:01.746]  And it's got all these huge actors, a lot of the folks from Lord of the Rings.
[00:33:01.766 --> 00:33:09.307]  I remember watching the making of Lord of the Rings, they had this sword master saying that Vigo was the best swordsman he'd ever seen for an actor.
[00:33:09.907 --> 00:33:12.208]  And he trained hundreds, he was listing all the things he'd done.
[00:33:12.508 --> 00:33:16.149]  I think that guy's in here, I think I recognized him when I was watching in your office a few weeks ago.
[00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:20.292]  When it came, and it turns out the maker of this is also a listener of the show.
[00:33:20.953 --> 00:33:23.896]  And so we appreciate Daniel McNichol for coming on.
[00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:25.917]  And just very, very exciting.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:27.098]  And this thing is not out yet.
[00:33:27.499 --> 00:33:29.341]  So when it comes out, we'll have him back on.
[00:33:29.381 --> 00:33:30.241]  Maybe we'll even carry it.
[00:33:30.281 --> 00:33:33.284]  But I would hope this would be in theaters or on TV.
[00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:37.308]  I'm flattered that we've kind of gotten this first kind of a sneak peek here.
[00:33:37.328 --> 00:33:40.050]  In fact, I've been so busy, I never even asked if we could play a clip or something.
[00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:41.692]  Whatever, it doesn't matter.
[00:33:42.173 --> 00:33:43.876]  Maybe on the second time he comes on.
[00:33:44.657 --> 00:33:47.341]  But Daniel McNichol, thank you for coming on today, sir.
[00:33:48.823 --> 00:33:55.474]  It's my pleasure, Alex, and let me say, it is a pleasure to be on your show, and you're a very good man, and keep up the great work.
[00:33:56.206 --> 00:33:56.867]  Well, I try.
[00:33:57.547 --> 00:34:16.802]  You're a great guy, because I always make the point, reading up on history, that going back to Rome, going back to the samurai 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago in Japan, going back to the Sun Kings in France, going back to the Tudors, the commoners, the slaves, couldn't own hunting dogs, couldn't have knives over a certain length with pointed ends,
[00:34:17.382 --> 00:34:17.623]  I don't know.
[00:34:33.602 --> 00:34:33.963]  Yes, we are.
[00:34:51.784 --> 00:34:54.625]  My dad was real good at fencing in college.
[00:34:54.645 --> 00:34:57.566]  So I know a little bit about it.
[00:34:58.127 --> 00:34:59.667]  But he said, no, no, watch the film.
[00:34:59.707 --> 00:35:00.228]  And I did.
[00:35:00.248 --> 00:35:01.668]  So it's great to have you here.
[00:35:01.708 --> 00:35:03.409]  The film is Reclaiming the Blade.
[00:35:03.429 --> 00:35:05.030]  Why do you say Reclaiming the Blade?
[00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.831]  Reclaiming the Blade is the movie.
[00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:17.555]  Actually, I must say that it is, even though it won't be in stores, which is Barnes & Noble and Target and Best Buy and Blockbuster and all that type stuff, that happens July 7th.
[00:35:17.655 --> 00:35:20.176]  But it actually is, we're being a bit sneaky,
[00:35:21.795 --> 00:35:31.521]  We've already gone ahead and we're releasing it directly from Galatia Films Home Entertainment, which is our shingle production company that put this film out.
[00:35:31.561 --> 00:35:32.582]  How do folks get it right now?
[00:35:33.302 --> 00:35:36.024]  SwordMovie.com, ReclaimingTheBlade.com.
[00:35:36.044 --> 00:35:37.265]  You can actually order the film.
[00:35:37.305 --> 00:35:38.606]  It actually is a two-disc set.
[00:35:39.099 --> 00:35:41.861]  So the second disc has a lot of great bonus features.
[00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:46.785]  There's like four hours of extra interviews with Viggo Mortensen and some great stuff.
[00:35:46.865 --> 00:35:48.706]  And what a workshop, because we went down to New Zealand.
[00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:50.067]  How did you get Viggo in this?
[00:35:50.107 --> 00:35:52.769]  I guess he's just a sword fanatic is what I've heard.
[00:35:53.469 --> 00:35:58.053]  Viggo is a great guy and you know, I can't say enough good things about him.
[00:35:58.373 --> 00:36:06.639]  He really, he'll do something not based on money, but based on whether or not he thinks it's a passion project.
[00:36:06.659 --> 00:36:07.059]  You know what I mean?
[00:36:07.822 --> 00:36:09.543]  So that's what's great about him.
[00:36:09.983 --> 00:36:12.785]  He's not one of these Hollywood actors that's driven by dollars, you know?
[00:36:13.385 --> 00:36:16.688]  So he just, you know, felt like it was the right thing to do.
[00:36:16.788 --> 00:36:22.651]  And obviously, one thing that attracted him was our tribute to Bob Anderson.
[00:36:23.192 --> 00:36:25.973]  So we did an exclusive with Bob, who was Darth Vader.
[00:36:26.053 --> 00:36:32.958]  He was actually in Darth Vader's costume training Mark Hamill, doing all the lightsaber duels with him in the first early films.
[00:36:33.018 --> 00:36:36.620]  He's trained Johnny Depp, who's also a big fan as well.
[00:36:37.233 --> 00:36:41.977]  You know, he's worked with everyone from Errol Flynn to, you know, to Viggo Mortensen.
[00:36:41.997 --> 00:36:45.099]  He's just a legend in the industry when it comes to fight choreography.
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:53.965]  But the interesting thing about the film, when I was writing it, I really wanted to get into the script.
[00:36:54.766 --> 00:37:04.653]  Some verbology, if you will, just some text in there that John Rhys-Davies would read, because John Rhys-Davies actually is a good friend of mine.
[00:37:04.673 --> 00:37:05.514]  He narrated the film.
[00:37:06.392 --> 00:37:15.036]  And, um, I was fascinated with this idea of the kings, and basically the kings of England had two choices when they were looking at an army.
[00:37:15.116 --> 00:37:20.258]  They had a choice A, which was hire your own military.
[00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:25.940]  That is, pay for your knights, pay them money, you know, it's a financed army.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:34.704]  So that's option A. Option B is let your whole country, all of your nation and all of your boys 13 ages and up,
[00:37:35.819 --> 00:37:41.019]  You know, study the longbow, study the sword, and be capable with arms.
[00:37:41.687 --> 00:37:50.413]  Yeah, that was the Dutch and the Swiss model and others, was to raise your army as the militia, and those always turned out to be the countries that didn't get invaded.
[00:37:50.533 --> 00:37:54.056]  But, if you had oppressive nobles, they didn't like to arm their people.
[00:37:54.076 --> 00:37:57.518]  So we think 1776 is where this keep and bear arms thing all began.
[00:37:57.538 --> 00:37:59.340]  No, it was a free man thing.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.902]  People had arms in England, that's what the Magna Carta was all about.
[00:38:03.223 --> 00:38:07.806]  And that's what's so great about your film, is that I think it's a great defense of the Second Amendment.
[00:38:08.556 --> 00:38:09.156]  Absolutely.
[00:38:09.716 --> 00:38:16.198]  And I'll just go ahead and say, on record, John Rhys-Davies is the Charlton Heston of today.
[00:38:16.358 --> 00:38:18.799]  I mean, he is a great defender of the Second Amendment.
[00:38:19.279 --> 00:38:22.040]  I don't want to really speak for any of the other actors, you know, they're great guys.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.641]  I know Viggo's obviously a supporter of Dennis Kucinich.
[00:38:25.701 --> 00:38:28.742]  Yeah, for the anti-war thing, I know Viggo's great.
[00:38:28.882 --> 00:38:35.665]  Absolutely, and if you look at the greatest periods of English history, they weren't the dark ages where the knights were paid by the king.
[00:38:58.399 --> 00:39:07.963]  They were an age where the king, and as we know, English history is, when you study English history, you look at the history of the monarchies, you know?
[00:39:08.424 --> 00:39:10.605]  Which king was in power at any given time?
[00:39:11.025 --> 00:39:19.649]  And the kings that gave the power to the people, they were taking a risk in a way, because if the people didn't like what the king was doing, they wouldn't support him.
[00:39:20.529 --> 00:39:22.630]  They'd say, I don't think so, you know?
[00:39:23.268 --> 00:39:28.101]  And so the king was beholden to the people, and the people had a checks and balance.
[00:39:28.652 --> 00:39:30.173]  That existed in the sword.
[00:39:30.853 --> 00:39:33.175]  The sword is really a checks and balance.
[00:39:33.695 --> 00:39:34.075]  That's it!
[00:39:34.135 --> 00:39:36.677]  You say it so simply instead of me sputtering and babbling.
[00:39:37.157 --> 00:39:38.258]  It is a check and balance.
[00:39:38.318 --> 00:39:39.718]  It is a canary in the coal mine.
[00:39:40.099 --> 00:39:42.660]  It is a great equalizer.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.581]  As the U.N.
[00:39:43.621 --> 00:39:48.824]  says, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:53.907]  Well, we believe a power monopoly of the state is illegitimate, but that's why this film is so important.
[00:39:53.927 --> 00:39:55.427]  And I didn't know it was available today.
[00:39:56.628 --> 00:39:57.609]  You just started offering it.
[00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.493]  So folks, tell folks how they get it again.
[00:40:01.514 --> 00:40:05.118]  We might get in trouble for this, but you know, let it be.
[00:40:05.598 --> 00:40:08.462]  It's actually available at SwordMovie.com and ReclaimTheBlade.
[00:40:08.482 --> 00:40:12.226]  It'll be in stores, Target, Barnes & Noble, etc., July 7th.
[00:40:12.386 --> 00:40:13.848]  And that's when we're really gonna...
[00:40:14.352 --> 00:40:17.634]  You know, hit with the publicity, and I'd love to have John Rhys-Davies on your show.
[00:40:17.794 --> 00:40:20.075]  Let's do it!
[00:40:20.215 --> 00:40:22.496]  And I promise I won't get you on late again.
[00:40:22.536 --> 00:40:27.339]  I just got into a rant, and then you were okay with it.
[00:40:27.519 --> 00:40:30.320]  If I could, I would love to send you guys some lightsabers.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.941]  I'll send you a couple.
[00:40:32.782 --> 00:40:33.942]  They're a lot of fun.
[00:40:33.982 --> 00:40:42.807]  The New Force FX lightsabers, I don't know if you've seen them, the Hasbro makes, but they're metal and plastic handles that are really heavy, so they got the good feel and the weight of a
[00:40:43.246 --> 00:40:46.848]  of a sword, and then they have all the sights and sounds of like a real lightsaber.
[00:40:46.908 --> 00:40:50.951]  No, no, I know, I've got, I've got, this is kind of, I've got five of them.
[00:40:51.471 --> 00:41:06.920]  I've got the little, well, I've got Yoda ones for my kids, little green ones, because, no, I mean, my bigger daughter and my son, because the baby obviously can't have sword fights, they attack me, and it's gotten to the point where they're beating me, and then I'll be fighting my son alone, and he's beating me some of the time.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:12.083]  So, you know, we have absolute knock-down drag-outs, and the neighbors are looking out their windows in the backyard about where,
[00:41:13.134 --> 00:41:15.675]  You know, it's just total warfare, but no, I want some of those.
[00:41:15.695 --> 00:41:16.316]  I want some more.
[00:41:16.996 --> 00:41:23.179]  I'll send some more, and I'll tell you what, look, I don't mean to get into the whole movie thing, but that's the great thing about movies.
[00:41:23.199 --> 00:41:36.026]  When you look at Robin Hood, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, 300, Gladiator, all of these movies have the same message, and that is, essentially, at the core, you have a rebel army against an empire.
[00:41:36.526 --> 00:41:42.269]  I mean, you look at Robin Hood, you've got Robin Hood, he robs from the rich, he gives to the poor, he protects the poor.
[00:41:43.311 --> 00:41:49.195]  King Richard is off on a crusade, and King John is this corrupt tyrant that has taken over England.
[00:41:49.676 --> 00:41:51.877]  And here's Robin Hood, you know, he's a rebel.
[00:41:52.297 --> 00:41:54.279]  Same thing with Star Wars, same exact thing.
[00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:58.722]  You have the Rebel Alliance, you have Order 66, which was execute all the rebels.
[00:41:59.182 --> 00:42:07.427]  You look at Pirates of the Caribbean, you have free sailors, free pirates, and you have this corrupt, tyrannical British Empire at the time.
[00:42:08.108 --> 00:42:11.390]  You know, obviously, a lot of these stories are based in fiction and history.
[00:42:11.897 --> 00:42:27.205]  But Pirates of the Caribbean, whether you're big on pirates or not, at the core of the story, it's about three men fighting against unjust taxes, no representation, and so they were thugs out doing what they could.
[00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:28.866]  Same thing with 300.
[00:42:29.086 --> 00:42:32.287]  300 is a very good example, because you have, obviously, 300 Spartans.
[00:42:34.326 --> 00:42:40.353]  And by the way, for folks that don't know, 300 is a true story.
[00:42:40.373 --> 00:42:47.261]  In the comic book version they add some ridiculous goblins and things, but that story is true.
[00:42:47.281 --> 00:42:50.485]  For those that don't know.
[00:42:51.145 --> 00:42:53.048]  It's fun to delve into the movies.
[00:42:58.015 --> 00:42:59.477]  We just lost his phone line.
[00:42:59.517 --> 00:43:01.179]  Let's call him back and get him back on.
[00:43:01.219 --> 00:43:02.321]  That happens occasionally.
[00:43:02.922 --> 00:43:04.584]  Genesis phone system didn't go down, did it?
[00:43:06.837 --> 00:43:08.338]  Alright, call him back, that was his phone then.
[00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:15.224]  Okay, you know what, let's bring Rob Dew in on this, because again, I wouldn't just have somebody on about a movie about swords.
[00:43:15.684 --> 00:43:25.532]  This is about the history of it, and how it's a check and balance, and how people fought to have the right to be armed, and absolutely, it was also a right to have social mobility.
[00:43:25.813 --> 00:43:35.200]  The first things that got liberalized, because frankly the kings wanted to have larger, stronger armies to take over other nations, so they allowed limited freedom, but the arming of the people did allow then
[00:43:36.101 --> 00:43:41.144]  The overthrow of some of the corrupt regimes that led into the Renaissance, more than even the Black Plague did.
[00:43:41.884 --> 00:43:44.165]  And then out of that, you had upward mobility.
[00:43:44.265 --> 00:43:50.668]  Now, somebody who wasn't born into nobility, they could become a knight.
[00:43:50.989 --> 00:43:56.871]  You know, they could become, and then that created, you know, that's why the old fable of King Arthur has its roots in reality.
[00:43:56.891 --> 00:44:01.754]  You know, he was the commoner pulling the sword out of the stone, but of course he wasn't really a commoner.
[00:44:02.094 --> 00:44:03.215]  So this is a big deal.
[00:44:03.275 --> 00:44:11.662]  This is about getting out of a caste system and we first see the caste system being overthrown to a certain extent with the free people becoming armed.
[00:44:12.283 --> 00:44:22.671]  Going back to our guest, Daniel McNichol and the new film Reclaiming the Blade, available here for the first time today at their website reclaimingtheblade.com.
[00:44:22.691 --> 00:44:23.993]  Okay, continue, you got cut off.
[00:44:25.534 --> 00:44:29.998]  Yeah, yeah, you know, technical difficulties there, but you know,
[00:44:31.194 --> 00:44:38.897]  At the heart of these stories is a message that I think, and hey, that's why they sell tickets for these type of movies, because it's something that resonates with people.
[00:44:39.558 --> 00:44:41.118]  You know, and that's the bottom line.
[00:44:41.138 --> 00:44:44.220]  If it didn't resonate and it didn't sell tickets, they wouldn't make those.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:48.642]  It's an archetypal, ancestral memory, whatever you want to call it.
[00:44:49.042 --> 00:44:49.282]  Sure.
[00:44:50.467 --> 00:44:51.769]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:54.993]  Humans defending themselves from saber-toothed tigers with a club.
[00:44:55.474 --> 00:44:57.297]  I mean, you know, you're supposed to have weapons.
[00:44:57.697 --> 00:44:58.578]  It's that simple.
[00:44:59.259 --> 00:45:02.544]  And the weapons aren't bad, it's the people that wield them sometimes in a bad way.
[00:45:03.685 --> 00:45:07.391]  Other points about the film, and then the extra disc that comes along with it?
[00:45:09.047 --> 00:45:09.688]  Sure, sure.
[00:45:09.708 --> 00:45:22.817]  You know, there's a lot of extra interviews with Viggo Mortensen and Karl Urban, who's in the new Star Trek movie, who was also in Lord of the Rings and has done a lot of sword wielding on a number of films.
[00:45:23.618 --> 00:45:28.101]  And then also, Ken Sparling from Skywalker's Bound did the 5.1 surround mix.
[00:45:29.873 --> 00:45:39.980]  If you're at all interested in just some good... We tried to make the documentary less informative and, well, informative but entertaining at the same time, and I hope we did that.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.343]  Because it's a bit... I wanted to add some epicness to it and make sure records put out our soundtrack.
[00:45:45.863 --> 00:45:47.284]  And there's a lot of great artists.
[00:45:47.364 --> 00:45:49.726]  The Doves, Julianne Hatfield, Twerp Driver.
[00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:53.188]  I actually... You've also got Gimli in it.
[00:45:53.228 --> 00:45:55.389]  The Dwarf from Lord of the Rings, who's also one of the stars.
[00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:57.091]  And stuff like Raiders from the Lost Ark.
[00:45:57.151 --> 00:45:57.951]  I love that actor.
[00:45:57.971 --> 00:45:58.912]  Tell us about him.
[00:45:59.676 --> 00:46:02.097]  Yeah, John Rhys-Davies is a great guy.
[00:46:02.117 --> 00:46:03.877]  He's a wonderful actor.
[00:46:03.897 --> 00:46:05.197]  He's very talented.
[00:46:05.237 --> 00:46:06.137]  He narrated the film.
[00:46:06.157 --> 00:46:08.378]  You were talking about him earlier.
[00:46:08.438 --> 00:46:11.058]  He's the guy that is a patriot for sure.
[00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:12.479]  Absolutely.
[00:46:13.459 --> 00:46:15.659]  No questions asked.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.300]  He's a lover of history.
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.700]  He understands history.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.501]  He understands where we're at today.
[00:46:21.521 --> 00:46:25.121]  And as I said, I think we should definitely get him on the show to talk.
[00:46:28.303 --> 00:46:29.324]  He's a great guy, actually.
[00:46:29.544 --> 00:46:38.310]  I wrote the narration for him, but he's so intelligent and bright that he actually added his own personality to it.
[00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:46.315]  I'm not the greatest writer in the world, but he was able to work with me on that and we were able to really get a great message in there.
[00:46:47.492 --> 00:46:52.994]  But no, I knew from the start when I started developing the film that he'd be a great voice for it.
[00:46:53.014 --> 00:46:57.856]  Tell us about this sword master that did all the Star Wars stuff and the rest of it.
[00:46:58.397 --> 00:47:00.517]  Because I think I've seen him in the documentaries about Lord of the Rings.
[00:47:00.557 --> 00:47:02.798]  That's the guy that trained Viggo, right?
[00:47:03.419 --> 00:47:03.799]  Sure.
[00:47:03.819 --> 00:47:04.699]  Yeah, Bob Anderson.
[00:47:04.739 --> 00:47:06.340]  He's trained Errol Flynn.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.901]  He's 80 plus years old.
[00:47:09.041 --> 00:47:13.843]  So I feel fortunate that we were able to sit down with him and have this interview.
[00:47:14.683 --> 00:47:16.224]  He's very spry for 80.
[00:47:17.194 --> 00:47:18.775]  And he's an amazing person.
[00:47:19.695 --> 00:47:22.616]  He trained Johnny Depp, Diego Mortensen.
[00:47:22.636 --> 00:47:28.397]  He's a very well-known... He looks like he's about 68 years old and you're saying he's 80.
[00:47:28.657 --> 00:47:37.300]  Yeah, he looks good, you know, and that's part of what I would like to see is exercise with the sport because it's something that attaches you.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.260]  It's not just running in a treadmill.
[00:47:41.368 --> 00:47:43.129]  Yeah, you're exercising with a sword.
[00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:44.891]  There's some thought behind it.
[00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:47.353]  There's some passion and spirit behind it.
[00:47:47.433 --> 00:47:48.694]  So, it's a lot of fun.
[00:47:48.774 --> 00:47:56.800]  I hope, and I like to think, and you know, I romanticize things about things sometimes a bit too much, but I'd like to think the sword has kept him alive for a while.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:04.005]  But he's a really, really passionate person in the film, and we have a lot of, he's a big part of it.
[00:48:04.606 --> 00:48:07.288]  And then also, another part of the film is the academics.
[00:48:07.328 --> 00:48:10.090]  I mean, we went to Oxford, and we talked to a lot of really good
[00:48:10.569 --> 00:48:11.750]  Martial arts expert.
[00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:30.740]  And we talk a lot about, you know, historical European martial arts and how the gun basically kind of changed, you know, warfare and how the sword evolved more into a sport and also into, you know, a symbol as opposed to just being a weapon.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:39.104]  But getting back to the English history of it, when you look at the English longbow, which is a really amazing tool and a weapon,
[00:48:39.796 --> 00:48:40.477]  I think so.
[00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:59.051]  Yeah, I mean, they could really hit a target well.
[00:48:59.091 --> 00:49:00.471]  I mean, obviously with scopes and everything.
[00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:04.132]  Well, the compound bow, and I'm no big mastermind with a bow, but I've done some deer hunting with them.
[00:49:04.552 --> 00:49:07.633]  I can shoot, like, a sapling at 150 yards, that big a round.
[00:49:07.653 --> 00:49:12.654]  You know, I'll say, I'm going to shoot that black, you know, knot on that tree with a target arrow and actually hit it.
[00:49:13.034 --> 00:49:13.935]  I mean, that's the thing.
[00:49:13.975 --> 00:49:19.016]  As they try to destroy the Second Amendment, we need to try to keep it, but also get good with bows, get good with swords.
[00:49:19.596 --> 00:49:22.777]  And plus, it's a lot of fun, and fencing is exhausting, is it not?
[00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:32.002]  Well, you know, I have to confess, I'm a filmmaker first and a martial artist on the side.
[00:49:32.282 --> 00:49:35.946]  I love doing the martial arts too, but I'm not that great at it.
[00:49:36.226 --> 00:49:36.727]  I leave that.
[00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:40.351]  But let me tell you about another project that could be really cool that we're working on.
[00:49:40.371 --> 00:49:44.155]  I don't know if you've seen Batman or Batman Begins or Dark Knight, but
[00:49:44.794 --> 00:50:01.868]  Uh, a lot of the fight choreography in that movie, I've been talking to some of the developers of that fight choreography, and I'd like to do another Reclaiming the Blade type movie with, uh, uh, Husto and, and, um, another guy, um, he's, uh, well, he worked with Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale.
[00:50:01.908 --> 00:50:07.112]  He trained Heath Ledger, actually, for, uh, for The Dark Knight, and Liam Neeson as well.
[00:50:07.193 --> 00:50:11.396]  But, um, there's some really cool martial arts of just hand-to-hand combat.
[00:50:11.943 --> 00:50:30.815]  And a lot of your listeners may not know this, but they've actually seen the fighting style called Casey's Fighting Method, KFM, which was used in The Dark Knight and also used in the other film, Batman Begins, but it's just another interesting project.
[00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:35.188]  Well, let's talk more about the film that just now is coming out when we come back.
[00:50:35.268 --> 00:50:37.172]  And Rob, dude, my producer's got some comments.
[00:50:37.192 --> 00:50:38.113]  I've been running on here.
[00:50:38.514 --> 00:50:41.419]  We really appreciate our guest Daniel McNichol joining us.
[00:50:41.519 --> 00:50:42.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:43.934 --> 00:50:47.216]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:51.459]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:51:03.068]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:51:03.308 --> 00:51:09.132]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:51:09.372 --> 00:51:09.993]  We're good to go.
[00:51:37.918 --> 00:51:45.123]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:45.283 --> 00:51:50.266]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.

[00:53:35.121 --> 00:53:35.321]  That's 888-654-3447.
[00:53:48.442 --> 00:53:51.307]  All right, we're going to try to hold Daniel McNichol five minutes to the next hour.
[00:53:51.868 --> 00:53:57.497]  Burmess has huge breaking news on the swine flu genetically engineered bioweapon story.
[00:53:57.537 --> 00:54:02.645]  This is huge, and it's mainstream, hidden in plain view, and I'd forgotten about this when he pointed it out to me.
[00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:05.929]  So, we have all these big scientists saying it was clearly engineered.
[00:54:05.969 --> 00:54:06.710]  We told you so.
[00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.332]  Big new developments coming up after I take a gamut of calls.
[00:54:09.773 --> 00:54:12.936]  Opening the phones up again for those that were holding that we had to let go earlier.
[00:54:12.956 --> 00:54:13.436]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:13.476 --> 00:54:18.481]  And the big news, lots of stuff I haven't covered coming up.
[00:54:18.501 --> 00:54:21.744]  But Rob Dew, I know you're a huge fan of this film as well.
[00:54:23.194 --> 00:54:29.561]  I hope this ends up being on TV, that's my next question, but any comments you've got about the new film out now, Reclaiming the Blade?
[00:54:44.264 --> 00:54:52.066]  What these guys are practicing is sort of a lost art and people are trying to bring it back in because it is another form to defend yourself and that's another great thing about it.
[00:54:52.466 --> 00:55:02.069]  You with your sword could go out and defend yourself, defend your family, defend your belongings and that's how you prove your worth, you know, is with the sword.
[00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:10.211]  And then it goes into, you know, we've had this in Western cultures, we had this in Asian cultures, you know, with their fighting style and it seems like
[00:55:11.038 --> 00:55:11.238]  Absolutely.
[00:55:11.258 --> 00:55:13.139]  Yeah, we actually have a wonderful sales agent, Lisa Romanoff.
[00:55:13.159 --> 00:55:14.320]  She's doing a very good job.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:24.847]  We are going to be airing it on the History Channel, likely PBS, and A&E, and there's some other contenders, which would be Discovery Channel, Learning Channel, so absolutely.
[00:55:41.368 --> 00:55:44.230]  Definitely have some air time for this on TV.
[00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:45.270]  No question about that.
[00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:51.074]  Even though it has a pro arms message.
[00:55:51.134 --> 00:55:51.434]  Wow.
[00:55:51.834 --> 00:55:52.875]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:52.955 --> 00:56:04.281]  Well, you know, I mean, I think, you know, the buyers are basically looking at dollars and they're basically looking at billing slots and they're looking for content.
[00:56:04.301 --> 00:56:09.084]  You know, I mean, the job of any buyer, whether it's a retail buyer or a buyer who's
[00:56:09.704 --> 00:56:11.685]  Who's finding content for TV.
[00:56:11.705 --> 00:56:14.846]  I mean, they're looking to fill slots in there.
[00:56:14.886 --> 00:56:20.028]  They're looking for content that's going to, you know, to be appealing to their audience.
[00:56:20.088 --> 00:56:24.330]  And so, yeah, I think for sure we should have some commercial TV.
[00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:27.832]  Actually, Mark Cuban wants to show it on HD next.
[00:56:27.932 --> 00:56:31.653]  So, I mean, but that's another, you know, place.
[00:56:31.673 --> 00:56:32.874]  We'll definitely do TV.
[00:56:33.014 --> 00:56:34.935]  You know, TV is something.
[00:56:36.501 --> 00:56:37.282]  It comes down to one.
[00:56:37.322 --> 00:56:42.604]  Typically with filmmaking, you know, you kind of do the theatrical thing, then you do home video, and then TV's kind of littered down the line.
[00:56:42.944 --> 00:56:44.425]  And that's how we've approached it.
[00:56:44.865 --> 00:56:51.328]  However, I think for us, in our marketing, it might do us better to hit the TV a little earlier.
[00:56:51.348 --> 00:56:59.152]  So I would say this fall, look for it on one of these channels, or a couple of these channels, and we'll definitely try to get it out there.
[00:57:01.107 --> 00:57:02.748]  Tell us about some of the other things you've done.
[00:57:02.808 --> 00:57:06.729]  This is a pretty big undertaking to get all these folks together and do such a great job.
[00:57:06.769 --> 00:57:08.949]  What other things have you worked on?
[00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:13.711]  Well, if I could speak for a moment on filmmaking in general.
[00:57:13.851 --> 00:57:17.792]  I wanted to say this to your audience today.
[00:57:17.812 --> 00:57:21.313]  It was something that was kind of weighing on me before you called.
[00:57:21.393 --> 00:57:25.615]  I thought, you know, I just felt that this was important.
[00:57:26.055 --> 00:57:28.896]  And that is filmmakers, independent filmmakers,
[00:57:30.878 --> 00:57:33.540]  That you love need to be supported.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:44.086]  You know, I want to just, you know, say you produce some great films and folks need to understand that you have to support the films that you love.
[00:57:44.526 --> 00:57:57.254]  You know, I mean, you know, instead of buying a ticket to maybe a big Hollywood blockbuster this summer, why not, you know, grab a copy of something from an independent filmmaker that you love and appreciate, you know, such as some of the titles you have.
[00:57:58.024 --> 00:57:59.705]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:28.556 --> 00:58:30.878]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:42.106]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:58:42.186 --> 00:58:47.770]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:51.893]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals
[00:58:52.446 --> 00:58:52.747]  I think so.
[00:59:07.878 --> 00:59:08.178]  I don't know.
[00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:38.292]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:59:38.772 --> 00:59:41.712]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:51.535 --> 00:59:52.635]  Reclaiming the Blade.
[00:59:52.675 --> 00:59:55.696]  We have the writer and director on with us right now.
[00:59:56.416 --> 01:00:00.137]  A lot of big names, a lot of the top people in sword training.
[01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:03.098]  Just an amazing film.
[01:00:03.258 --> 01:00:04.079]  Two discs set.
[01:00:04.159 --> 01:00:05.379]  Disc 2 is the making.
[01:00:07.054 --> 01:00:11.357]  of the film, exclusive additional footage and interviews, over an hour of sword training videos.
[01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:12.398]  I'm going to enjoy watching that.
[01:00:13.259 --> 01:00:19.944]  Because I've got to learn how to beat my six-year-old and four-year-old because they're becoming too powerful for me.
[01:00:21.725 --> 01:00:22.506]  Oh my goodness.
[01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:27.550]  And it's presented in widescreen with optional commentary with the director.
[01:00:29.582 --> 01:00:34.403]  Absolutely, it really technically isn't out until July 7th, but we're doing, we're just
[01:00:58.464 --> 01:01:00.426]  You know, we're saying, what the heck, we're getting it out there.
[01:01:00.486 --> 01:01:05.590]  Glacier Films Home Entertainment, which is our label that we're putting it out on.
[01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:09.574]  It's thortmovie.com and reclaimingtheblade.com, which are our site.
[01:01:09.714 --> 01:01:13.117]  You can actually order it directly from there and we'll ship it to you.
[01:01:13.377 --> 01:01:19.503]  And it will be in stores and retail box stores July 7th.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:24.364]  Uh, on iTunes, Apple iTunes for download and all that good stuff.
[01:01:24.544 --> 01:01:28.649]  And hopefully this fall, uh, well definitely this fall we're gonna see it on TV.
[01:01:28.709 --> 01:01:32.914]  So, uh, Igo Mortensen, Carl Urban, who's in the new Star Trek, what a workshop.
[01:01:32.934 --> 01:01:36.598]  We went down to Weta, who did all the sword, uh, for The Lord of the Rings.
[01:01:36.658 --> 01:01:39.361]  And today, a very in-depth exclusive with them.
[01:01:39.401 --> 01:01:40.983]  Richard Taylor, who's the director there.
[01:01:41.779 --> 01:01:43.260]  John Rhys-Davies is the narrator.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.384]  The Royal Armouries in Britain, actually, was a partner of this film, which is awesome.
[01:01:48.424 --> 01:01:50.145]  Lakeshore Records put out the soundtrack.
[01:01:51.366 --> 01:01:52.887]  Ken Sparling at Skywalker Sound.
[01:01:52.947 --> 01:02:11.319]  It's just, it's a phenomenal group of people coming together for a really good cause, which, in my mind, is a tribute to people like Bob Anderson and to people that have worked for years in the industry, but also a tribute to the martial artist and the symbol of the sword, because really the sword is a symbol.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.343]  You know, it's not necessarily just the sword.
[01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:16.186]  The sword represents so much more.
[01:02:16.246 --> 01:02:18.450]  It represents the Second Amendment.
[01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:21.915]  It represents, you know, whatever the weapons are of today.
[01:02:21.935 --> 01:02:23.657]  It represents all of these things.
[01:02:23.758 --> 01:02:27.103]  So, it's not just a martial weapon, but it's also a symbol.
[01:02:27.588 --> 01:02:31.150]  Well, I want to get John Rhys-Davies and you back on right before it comes out.
[01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:31.530]  Sure.
[01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:34.291]  Here on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:41.394]  And, you know, I'm not a big collector of things, so I don't have time or money to do it, but I actually have bought a few collector swords.
[01:02:41.414 --> 01:02:46.997]  I mean, because there were so many millions made over the years, you can get like a 300, 400-year-old sword, you know, for super cheap.
[01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:48.238]  And they're just really neat.
[01:02:49.038 --> 01:02:51.099]  Yeah, my publicist will kill me if I don't mention this.
[01:02:51.259 --> 01:02:54.160]  We are actually giving away some, you know, $900-plus
[01:02:55.922 --> 01:02:59.165]  Hey, what Star Wars sabers are you giving out?
[01:02:59.185 --> 01:02:59.445]  More Yodas?
[01:03:22.329 --> 01:03:30.714]  Well, you know, the Yoda's are great for kids, but we're definitely going to be doing some Darth Maul's and some of the Anakin Skywalkers, and my favorite, which is the Anakin.
[01:03:30.734 --> 01:03:31.554]  I've got a green one, yeah.
[01:03:31.995 --> 01:03:33.015]  I mean, I love the blue one.
[01:03:33.035 --> 01:03:34.236]  The Anakin's blue, right?
[01:03:35.436 --> 01:03:41.420]  The Anakin is blue, and then when you're on the dark side, you've got the red saber as well.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.981]  I think the Darth Vader saber, obviously, is red.
[01:03:44.001 --> 01:03:44.841]  I have that.
[01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:47.223]  But yeah, we're giving those away.
[01:03:47.383 --> 01:03:50.805]  And as I said before, I definitely want to send some to you and just
[01:03:51.587 --> 01:03:57.716]  You know, it would make me happy to think that you guys were running around your studios, you know, having some sort of fight every now and then.
[01:03:57.916 --> 01:03:59.699]  Hey, I was sent by the Darkon, folks.
[01:03:59.739 --> 01:04:02.203]  He's the filmmaker of some Darkon sort.
[01:04:02.243 --> 01:04:04.887]  So, no, I want more lightsabers.
[01:04:05.348 --> 01:04:07.110]  Bring them, or I'll defeat you, Rob Do.
[01:04:07.851 --> 01:04:08.411]  Look at Rob do.
[01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:09.392]  I'm going to crush him.
[01:04:09.832 --> 01:04:11.973]  I'm going to destroy you as soon as these swords come in.
[01:04:12.293 --> 01:04:20.177]  Hey listen, it was great having the writer and director of Reclaiming the Blade on with us, Daniel McNichol.
[01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:21.957]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:04:21.997 --> 01:04:25.159]  I hope folks get the DVD at the website today, my friend.
[01:04:25.939 --> 01:04:26.339]  My pleasure.
[01:04:26.939 --> 01:04:27.820]  It was great having you.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:33.182]  And listen, talk to Rob as soon as you want to come back on and have the dwarf Gimli on.
[01:04:33.582 --> 01:04:34.323]  We're really excited.
[01:04:34.363 --> 01:04:34.663]  Thank you.
[01:04:36.585 --> 01:04:39.687]  Okay, hardcore news straight ahead, but there's some history for you.
[01:04:40.047 --> 01:04:41.589]  I love it, so that's why we covered it.
[01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:48.733]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[01:04:49.134 --> 01:04:57.319]  Check out SupernaturalSilver.com today, or visit the link on InfoWars.com to find out more about this incredible new silver compound.
[01:04:57.419 --> 01:05:04.184]  The new silver solution is a natural antibiotic that is clinically tested to kill viruses, germs, bacteria, and yeast safely.
[01:05:04.502 --> 01:05:11.108]  This new silver solution liquid form was shown to be a powerful preventative for H5N1 influenza.
[01:05:11.468 --> 01:05:16.813]  This new technology has proven itself to be a formidable weapon against bio-threats of today and tomorrow.
[01:05:17.033 --> 01:05:20.276]  The new silver solution gel has been shown to disinfect topically.
[01:05:20.592 --> 01:05:23.673]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:57.146]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:05:57.666 --> 01:06:03.851]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:04.191 --> 01:06:06.073]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:06.233 --> 01:06:08.635]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:19.704]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:20.288 --> 01:06:21.589]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:21.969 --> 01:06:23.350]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:30.133]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:30.733 --> 01:06:38.497]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:38.997 --> 01:06:40.138]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:40.558 --> 01:06:41.759]  The people strike back.
[01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:46.785]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:06:47.145 --> 01:06:48.886]  Now, going green can save money.
[01:06:49.066 --> 01:06:54.407]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:06:54.608 --> 01:07:02.350]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[01:07:40.426 --> 01:07:43.007]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[01:07:45.168 --> 01:07:51.190]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:54.771]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:56.112 --> 01:07:58.455]  Okay, I'm going to take call after call at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:58.475 --> 01:07:58.776]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:58.856 --> 01:08:02.821]  For five minutes, huge new breaking swine flu news that is in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:08:13.359 --> 01:08:17.941]  But it's from decades ago, a key piece of the puzzle coming up.
[01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:25.304]  And I'm going to do a news blitz and announce at the end of the show two new films being released today.
[01:08:25.845 --> 01:08:32.488]  Two new films being released today that I've made.
[01:08:33.336 --> 01:08:34.497]  That we've made here in this office.
[01:08:34.557 --> 01:08:34.837]  Two!
[01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:35.917]  Not one, not two.
[01:08:35.937 --> 01:08:38.759]  I've been saying one, but it's really two.
[01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:40.179]  Big surprise coming up in the show.
[01:08:40.419 --> 01:08:41.920]  Let's go right now to Sam in Mass.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.161]  Sam, thanks for holding it on the air.
[01:08:46.762 --> 01:08:48.423]  Hello, Sam!
[01:08:48.803 --> 01:08:49.704]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:08:49.904 --> 01:08:50.524]  Yes, I can.
[01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:52.005]  Alright, hey Alex.
[01:08:52.345 --> 01:08:55.266]  I wanted to touch on the purpose of the GPS census workers.
[01:08:56.007 --> 01:09:02.110]  As we are all aware, 140,000 census workers have been sent to every door in America to tag position stop points.
[01:09:03.086 --> 01:09:03.867]  We already have a GPS.
[01:09:03.927 --> 01:09:05.168]  That's Phase 1, they admit.
[01:09:05.188 --> 01:09:06.189]  They don't ask you questions.
[01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:10.692]  It's for the Phase 2, but it's for SWAT teams and others, and for the Feds to know where you're at.
[01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:11.533]  It's for Homeland Security.
[01:09:11.553 --> 01:09:11.993]  That's amended.
[01:09:12.033 --> 01:09:12.333]  Go ahead.
[01:09:13.054 --> 01:09:13.314]  Okay.
[01:09:13.594 --> 01:09:15.556]  Well, I have my own theory.
[01:09:15.576 --> 01:09:22.622]  So, there really is no need to pay 140,000 workers to redo a job that's already catalogued.
[01:09:22.702 --> 01:09:28.947]  Simply put, they have this information already, except they have to do Step A and B to get to C. They want C in a single database.
[01:09:28.967 --> 01:09:32.830]  Your location, your neighbor's location, the track away point system.
[01:09:33.223 --> 01:09:37.004]  The only reason they would need this is for a computer system or a computer program.
[01:09:37.144 --> 01:09:54.709]  When the swine flu breaks out this winter, because people choose to get the virus with their yearly flu vaccine, trading liberty for death, I believe this winter, they've learned from the Holocaust, they will not be coming to your house, forcing you from your home, putting you in jeeps with men and guns, saying how MTV likes to show the public.
[01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:56.330]  It can happen today.
[01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:56.390]  No.
[01:09:57.446 --> 01:10:02.448]  Alex, they'll come to your house in unmanned vehicles and every day playing soothing noises like an ice cream truck.
[01:10:02.488 --> 01:10:10.472]  They will circle the neighborhoods of America and over loudspeaker announce medical attention, food, water, and safety if people board the trucks and take them to FEMA camps.
[01:10:10.912 --> 01:10:14.913]  They cannot enforce the new world order without this virus, without this pandemic.
[01:10:14.953 --> 01:10:16.134]  They don't need to take our guns.
[01:10:16.174 --> 01:10:23.117]  They will let their worries rot in the streets and take their worries, you, to government facilities where obviously you can't bring your guns with you.
[01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:28.449]  Sir, well said, and you should write an article about that.
[01:10:28.589 --> 01:10:29.569]  Sounds like you did write one.
[01:10:29.749 --> 01:10:30.970]  Send that to us, we'll post it.
[01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:34.751]  Because that is one of the things in their fist.
[01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:37.893]  They have a fist with ten cards or so in it.
[01:10:38.413 --> 01:10:43.095]  And as I said back on March 5th, a month plus before it got released,
[01:10:43.855 --> 01:10:57.479]  I said nukes, war with Pakistan or Iran, more staged terror attacks like 9-11, a staged flu outbreak, whether real or just hype, that that was in their fist of things that they could do.
[01:10:57.579 --> 01:11:01.360]  And I said it was a manufactured virus when it broke out, and now they've had to admit that.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:06.441]  And then I predicted they would then say, oh, it will mutate later and be deadly, take your shots.
[01:11:06.941 --> 01:11:08.141]  And now they're saying that.
[01:11:08.241 --> 01:11:09.882]  I just know the enemy.
[01:11:10.422 --> 01:11:15.466]  And if they think we're going to be sold on this, and we'll go along with this, they're going to go ahead with it.
[01:11:15.546 --> 01:11:19.730]  But the number one videos on YouTube, Google, and all the other top video sites everywhere.
[01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:24.113]  You heard Watson earlier on the big search engines where they list the top searches.
[01:11:24.534 --> 01:11:25.675]  It's Infowars.com.
[01:11:25.735 --> 01:11:26.475]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:11:27.776 --> 01:11:30.559]  We're in the top 50 now of things being searched on the web.
[01:11:32.281 --> 01:11:42.732]  When you look at that, you understand we were actually countering them, and that's why they went through YouTube and just blasted every video where I was talking about swine flu.
[01:11:43.273 --> 01:11:45.535]  Because I was exposing that, and I appreciate your call.
[01:11:45.896 --> 01:11:47.518]  Which shows we've got a chance.
[01:11:47.558 --> 01:11:50.981]  They wouldn't be erasing what I do if it wasn't hurting them.
[01:11:51.282 --> 01:11:52.063]  And I'm nobody!
[01:11:53.177 --> 01:11:57.120]  I'm just some aggressive person that's got a half-decent brain that isn't putting up with slavery.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:03.084]  Now, there's folks a lot smarter and better looking and tougher than I am and got more money than I do.
[01:12:03.144 --> 01:12:04.726]  What are you doing sitting on your fat butt?
[01:12:05.346 --> 01:12:07.668]  Well, you've decided it's not your job to fight tyranny.
[01:12:07.708 --> 01:12:09.929]  You've decided you're not going to be involved in that.
[01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:15.774]  Folks, we have no future if you don't see yourself in that role as a freedom fighter against tyranny.
[01:12:15.794 --> 01:12:17.675]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:12:18.476 --> 01:12:19.636]  Joshua in Michigan.
[01:12:19.997 --> 01:12:21.038]  You're on the air, Joshua.
[01:12:21.058 --> 01:12:21.378]  Go ahead.
[01:12:22.353 --> 01:12:24.618]  Oh, thanks so much Alex for taking the call.
[01:12:24.918 --> 01:12:29.387]  You know, I've been a big fan for a long time through the work that you did and Jason Burmiss.
[01:12:29.508 --> 01:12:31.151]  You guys really woke me up a few years ago.
[01:12:31.191 --> 01:12:32.093]  I started doing my homework.
[01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:40.096]  And, uh, I really want to empathize with them taking down your two YouTube channels, or the one that, um, was the Alex Jones Channel.
[01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:43.239]  Three channels, channels run by other people.
[01:12:43.339 --> 01:12:46.241]  I call Nate Evans up and go, you have a director account, can we use it?
[01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:52.667]  And he says, oh, I loaded your videos up, they suspended my director account, and didn't even say copyright infringement.
[01:12:53.294 --> 01:12:54.095]  No, me too.
[01:12:54.135 --> 01:12:59.459]  You know, I had a YouTube channel by the name of Anonymous Patriot USA.
[01:12:59.479 --> 01:13:01.240]  I put together a Chemtrails documentary.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.041]  I remember that!
[01:13:02.241 --> 01:13:03.222]  I remember your channel!
[01:13:03.782 --> 01:13:04.483]  Thank you so much.
[01:13:04.523 --> 01:13:05.224]  I appreciate that.
[01:13:05.244 --> 01:13:10.828]  I put together the ultimate Chemtruth documentary that is up on your InfoWars.dk site.
[01:13:11.048 --> 01:13:17.994]  It is part of the four top Chemtrails documentaries, and I feel so flattered that you guys recognized the contribution that I made.
[01:13:18.929 --> 01:13:38.876]  And, uh, I just tried to compile all of the mainstream, uh, news footage I could find on Chemtrails and the links to Morgellons, the Rant interview, because in December of 2007, um, I started noticing it and videotaping it and, uh, becoming a big proponent of getting the truth out there and, uh, putting, uh, putting the dots together.
[01:13:39.936 --> 01:13:48.079]  And, uh, I've got a new one that's called Chemicill, uh, the movie, and it's got even more extended news, uh, coverage and background history.
[01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:57.738]  Well, you know, I'm making a chemtrail film slash eugenics film as well.
[01:13:58.178 --> 01:14:00.839]  That's the next thing I'm doing after this next Obama deal we're working on.
[01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:04.240]  So please, collaborate with us or anything you think we could use.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.280]  Get it to us.
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:06.201]  I need everybody to help me.
[01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:07.861]  God bless you and I appreciate your call, Joshua.
[01:14:07.881 --> 01:14:11.002]  I could talk to all these callers for ten hours, but if I'm actually going to get to you, I've got to move.
[01:14:11.362 --> 01:14:12.622]  Jason in Wisconsin.
[01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:13.622]  You're on the air.
[01:14:13.662 --> 01:14:14.103]  Go ahead.
[01:14:14.203 --> 01:14:14.983]  Next door to Michigan.
[01:14:15.023 --> 01:14:15.343]  Go ahead.
[01:14:16.728 --> 01:14:17.469]  Yes, yes, thank you.
[01:14:17.909 --> 01:14:30.435]  Hey, I was wondering, Walt was talking earlier about the white vans being labeled as terrorists, and I thought that was kind of funny because I would think that would be something they'd want to look for considering 9-11.
[01:14:30.955 --> 01:14:35.958]  That was exactly what the terrorists were using from Israel that I documented so well in the film, Missing Links.
[01:14:37.796 --> 01:14:45.785]  Well, certainly there was an Israeli company that was there in white vans and I had the police chief on from Bergen County.
[01:14:46.445 --> 01:14:47.727]  They have police chiefs in the county.
[01:14:47.747 --> 01:14:49.228]  It was like five, six years ago.
[01:14:49.328 --> 01:14:50.570]  That interview is out there on the web.
[01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:53.973]  And I had him on about how he said everybody should be forced to take a microchip.
[01:14:54.874 --> 01:14:55.514]  Well, that's it.
[01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:55.774]  Thank you.
[01:15:19.969 --> 01:15:20.369]  Okay.
[01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:24.612]  Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in Florida.
[01:15:25.012 --> 01:15:26.333]  Greg, you're on the air.
[01:15:26.393 --> 01:15:26.793]  Go ahead.
[01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:28.334]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:15:28.894 --> 01:15:29.455]  Good.
[01:15:29.615 --> 01:15:32.536]  I wanted to let you know I called Congressman Rooney's office.
[01:15:32.556 --> 01:15:36.158]  He's my local senator, congressman, whatever.
[01:15:36.579 --> 01:15:41.061]  And I asked him about the MIAC report because I'm a former military veteran myself.
[01:15:41.141 --> 01:15:43.643]  And I told him he kind of scared me that this was coming out.
[01:15:43.743 --> 01:15:46.704]  And he told me to take it with a grain of salt.
[01:15:48.188 --> 01:15:51.516]  Not to take anything too seriously coming out of this administration.
[01:15:53.461 --> 01:15:54.945]  Well, this is the kind of country I live in.
[01:15:55.005 --> 01:15:57.130]  I can't really take it with a grain of salt, man.
[01:15:58.327 --> 01:15:59.308]  That's what they tell you.
[01:15:59.508 --> 01:16:05.111]  Oh, you know, we're passing laws to where if you're a conservative, you're not going to be allowed to own guns anymore.
[01:16:05.171 --> 01:16:13.496]  I mean, they have the bill introduced with the White House Chief of Staff on tape saying, if we list you as an extremist, you are not allowed to own guns anymore.
[01:16:13.516 --> 01:16:14.937]  We're going to have a national list.
[01:16:15.497 --> 01:16:16.558]  It's now happening.
[01:16:16.818 --> 01:16:21.141]  They got a million, 100,000 innocent Americans on the fly list.
[01:16:21.801 --> 01:16:23.902]  Now they've got the four million on the crime list.
[01:16:24.383 --> 01:16:28.885]  This is the model I've been telling you for years they were going to use, and it's happening, and they say, shh, shh, shh.
[01:16:29.406 --> 01:16:37.471]  So there's a couple bills moving through Congress fast, look like they may pass, to arrest you if somebody says you hurt their feelings on the internet with a federal felony.
[01:16:37.891 --> 01:16:38.512]  It's okay.
[01:16:39.152 --> 01:16:40.313]  Going to prison's not a big deal.
[01:16:40.993 --> 01:16:42.274]  They have no free speech, it's freedom.
[01:16:43.034 --> 01:16:50.818]  And yeah, we're trying to pass laws to have fairness doctrine, and yeah, we're trying to pass bills where the Attorney General can ban any guns he wants.
[01:16:51.318 --> 01:16:58.221]  We have the bill number, and the national media goes, these crazy people, like Alex Jones, says that Obama wants your guns.
[01:16:58.882 --> 01:17:00.763]  So see, they use psych warfare.
[01:17:00.963 --> 01:17:05.045]  As they're trying to take them, they say, we're not taking your guns, now hand them over.
[01:17:05.845 --> 01:17:06.625]  One more just tidbit.
[01:17:06.645 --> 01:17:18.651]  I'll tell you it's been six years since I've been out of the military and they used to line us up and give us shots all the time.
[01:17:26.656 --> 01:17:29.277]  Uh, they never even told us what it was that they were shooting us with.
[01:17:29.377 --> 01:17:35.079]  And it was illegal for them to give you smallpox and anthrax shots, because people say, well, you're in the military, you have no rights.
[01:17:35.119 --> 01:17:45.262]  No, if it's an experimental, unapproved vaccine, they, by law, have to get your consent, but they force troops to take it, and that's why the troops have such a higher cancer level than any other group of people.
[01:17:46.723 --> 01:17:52.225]  Right, well... That's why I tell troops it's important to answer the questionnaires that you will fire on U.S.
[01:17:52.245 --> 01:17:54.826]  citizens, because we've talked to Army doctors and others
[01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:58.279]  Well, I was going to say, I haven't been sick since I got out.
[01:17:58.319 --> 01:18:00.761]  It's been probably six years since I had a cold.
[01:18:24.258 --> 01:18:25.718]  The flu, anything.
[01:18:25.738 --> 01:18:29.279]  I haven't even had a sore throat in it's been a long time.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:34.101]  Did you call in when I was on... Did you call in when I was on Coast to Coast AM last?
[01:18:35.561 --> 01:18:35.921]  No, sir.
[01:18:37.942 --> 01:18:41.903]  Yeah, there was another guy called in and said that since he hadn't been taking the vaccines, he never gets sick anymore.
[01:18:41.943 --> 01:18:43.063]  Good to hear from him.
[01:18:43.503 --> 01:18:44.724]  When I was on that show, he said that.
[01:18:45.084 --> 01:18:46.124]  Let's go to another one here.
[01:18:46.244 --> 01:18:53.106]  Well... No, I don't want to... I don't want to cheat this caller coming up, so we'll come back and go to...
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.140]  Thomas.
[01:18:56.961 --> 01:18:57.301]  John.
[01:18:57.381 --> 01:18:58.122]  Oh, John disagrees.
[01:18:58.182 --> 01:18:58.622]  I didn't see that.
[01:18:58.642 --> 01:18:59.362]  We'll go to him first.
[01:18:59.923 --> 01:19:00.723]  Stephen, Texas.
[01:19:00.763 --> 01:19:01.744]  Charles in New York.
[01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:08.488]  And by the way, the last two swine flus, 1976 and 1918, popped up on U.S.
[01:19:08.508 --> 01:19:09.209]  military bases.
[01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:11.530]  Guess what we found from the 1970?
[01:19:13.051 --> 01:19:15.773]  Wait till Jason Bermas is in studio with his 33 after.
[01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:22.097]  Coming up for a quick five minutes, and then I'm going to announce two new films, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:22.197 --> 01:19:24.999]  Two new films that are
[01:19:26.089 --> 01:19:27.211]  Being released today.
[01:19:27.652 --> 01:19:30.397]  Two little salvos, little extra torpedoes we're firing.
[01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:34.084]  With no promotion, I'm just dropping these with no warning.
[01:19:34.865 --> 01:19:36.348]  And we'll announce that at the end of the show.
[01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:38.712]  Here's a little tidbit hint.
[01:19:39.918 --> 01:19:41.619]  I didn't tell Aaron, so he jumped the gun.
[01:19:41.779 --> 01:19:43.921]  Already one of the films is posted at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:43.941 --> 01:19:48.745]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from HempUSA.org.
[01:19:48.965 --> 01:19:57.371]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[01:19:57.591 --> 01:20:02.275]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[01:20:02.495 --> 01:20:09.300]  There are no filters to buy, and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.101]  We're good to go.
[01:20:25.455 --> 01:20:30.877]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:50.285 --> 01:20:58.054]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:58.394 --> 01:21:06.262]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:06.583 --> 01:21:11.328]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:11.648 --> 01:21:16.369]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:16.869 --> 01:21:20.730]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.230]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:26.391]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:26.811 --> 01:21:31.192]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:31.712 --> 01:21:34.273]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:34.713 --> 01:21:36.353]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.422]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.583 --> 01:21:48.827]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:54.963]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:55.503 --> 01:22:01.687]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:01.927 --> 01:22:03.808]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:03.968 --> 01:22:06.369]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:22:06.429 --> 01:22:17.315]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:19.622 --> 01:22:20.862]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:21.282 --> 01:22:22.683]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:23.143 --> 01:22:29.485]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:37.827]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:38.307 --> 01:22:39.467]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.068]  The people strike back.
[01:22:42.978 --> 01:22:46.360]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:51.703]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:22:51.903 --> 01:22:56.666]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:22:56.866 --> 01:23:07.832]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:23:08.112 --> 01:23:13.675]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:19.938]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:23:20.098 --> 01:23:20.738]  What about you?
[01:23:20.958 --> 01:23:22.859]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:23:22.879 --> 01:23:26.981]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:23:27.182 --> 01:23:29.423]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-KDF.
[01:23:30.043 --> 01:23:30.603]  Breaking News!
[01:24:00.607 --> 01:24:02.588]  Breaking news coming up in a moment.
[01:24:02.628 --> 01:24:03.568]  Big news blitz.
[01:24:03.768 --> 01:24:08.110]  And I will play the trailer for the new film I am releasing today.
[01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:10.311]  That is, I'm starting pre-orders for it today.
[01:24:12.171 --> 01:24:16.353]  And it will be released at PrisonPlanet.tv June 3rd.
[01:24:16.373 --> 01:24:19.494]  And the DVDs are now in.
[01:24:20.335 --> 01:24:21.875]  So it'll be shipping out.
[01:24:21.895 --> 01:24:23.656]  We'll have them all boxed up and ready to be shipped out.
[01:24:23.676 --> 01:24:26.197]  So you'll get them very, very quickly after the June 3rd.
[01:24:28.945 --> 01:24:34.448]  Hello Alex, I just wanted to say that I finally signed up for Prison Planet and I just love it.
[01:24:34.468 --> 01:24:37.009]  The part that I disagree about with this GPS mapping modeling
[01:24:58.050 --> 01:25:03.134]  Um, effort that's being conducted right now is in the Origins of the Mandate.
[01:25:03.474 --> 01:25:12.441]  This actually came from, and it took me many hours to find it, this came from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs Statistics Division.
[01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:25.250]  It's Statistical Paper Series M, Number 67, Revision 2, entitled Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Census.
[01:25:25.905 --> 01:25:34.674]  This is a United Nations mandate that came out in November of 2008 and... No, no, no, wait a minute.
[01:25:34.714 --> 01:25:37.036]  We actually covered that on the show.
[01:25:37.516 --> 01:25:39.038]  So we did mention that.
[01:25:39.278 --> 01:25:44.303]  But yes, look, the census, everything, how our national ID cards work, is a 2000 treaty.
[01:25:45.644 --> 01:25:46.585]  You're absolutely right.
[01:25:46.885 --> 01:25:56.390]  This is United Nations, worldwide, under global governance, wants to know where everything is placed, your name, with your home, where you're at.
[01:25:57.211 --> 01:25:58.751]  On a worldwide basis?
[01:25:59.452 --> 01:25:59.832]  No, I know.
[01:25:59.892 --> 01:26:00.933]  And you know what?
[01:26:00.953 --> 01:26:02.954]  We showed that UN document on screen.
[01:26:03.414 --> 01:26:05.335]  I spent like two minutes on it a week ago.
[01:26:05.735 --> 01:26:07.035]  We should do an article about it.
[01:26:07.055 --> 01:26:07.655]  Here's the problem.
[01:26:07.715 --> 01:26:08.396]  I don't have the writers.
[01:26:08.816 --> 01:26:09.856]  Write an article about it.
[01:26:10.336 --> 01:26:12.357]  Send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:26:12.797 --> 01:26:15.338]  Send it to Rob D. Send it to Kurt.
[01:26:15.778 --> 01:26:17.438]  And one of them will be sure to post it.
[01:26:17.718 --> 01:26:19.559]  Send it to everybody to make sure and say post it.
[01:26:19.979 --> 01:26:20.979]  And so put that together.
[01:26:21.039 --> 01:26:22.620]  I mean, I need writers to volunteer.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:30.622]  I can't... Well, I'll be glad to do that because I did it on my... I do a newsletter that I send out to a group that I have in this part of the country.
[01:26:31.112 --> 01:26:42.917]  But you know, here's the interesting thing, very odd about this document, is that when it gives on the very first pages, it tells to whom this document applies and it gives the various regions.
[01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:50.900]  Every region of the world is covered under this document and the only one they left out is North America.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:54.541]  So apparently Obama has signed on to this
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:27:01.885]  A United Nations global mandate without asking the United Nations.
[01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:12.192]  The United States signed onto it and it was brought up in 1998 and the UN document we read and posted that's running this and then the federal agency signed the treaties.
[01:27:12.212 --> 01:27:13.613]  When Bush signed onto UNESCO,
[01:27:14.974 --> 01:27:17.857]  In 2004, Reagan had taken us off in 1982.
[01:27:18.378 --> 01:27:19.519]  He put us back on it.
[01:27:19.859 --> 01:27:29.850]  That's why you see the Statistic Bureau under the census say in 2004, from the document we saw, that we're now under this through UN mandate.
[01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:31.812]  So, you know, everything's UN order.
[01:27:31.892 --> 01:27:35.696]  Sir, I report on my employees to the North American Union.
[01:27:36.397 --> 01:27:38.578]  And you show it to a yuppie and they say, I don't see that.
[01:27:39.218 --> 01:27:41.259]  I'll hand my weapons in if the government tells me.
[01:27:41.279 --> 01:27:42.640]  I love government.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.221]  I love being a slave.
[01:27:45.742 --> 01:27:48.263]  I can lift a finger and stop all this, but I'm not going to.
[01:27:49.203 --> 01:27:55.006]  Let me ask you, did you show the 2008 revision too on the show?
[01:27:55.046 --> 01:27:57.667]  Because I certainly missed it and I try to watch every day.
[01:27:57.687 --> 01:27:58.548]  No, I saw a 2004 and a 1998.
[01:27:58.628 --> 01:28:01.849]  Well, I've got the 2008, so I'll send it over as soon as I get off the phone here.
[01:28:06.039 --> 01:28:09.802]  And it'll be under the title line will be shout.
[01:28:10.282 --> 01:28:10.522]  Good.
[01:28:10.882 --> 01:28:11.723]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:12.383 --> 01:28:13.404]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:28:13.424 --> 01:28:14.284]  Title line will be shout.
[01:28:14.304 --> 01:28:14.865]  We'll get that up.
[01:28:16.121 --> 01:28:18.582]  Better yet, write an article, because everything you said I know is accurate, so do it!
[01:28:18.822 --> 01:28:19.423]  I can't do it!
[01:28:19.963 --> 01:28:21.184]  I'm being hit from too many sides!
[01:28:21.424 --> 01:28:36.872]  I've been asking Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo, Kurt wrote one last Saturday, I've been asking Paul Watson for four days, I said write an article about the gun grabbing that ties it in with the White House Chief of Staff saying we'll all be on list, no judge, no jury, guilty until proven innocent, no owning firearms, tie it in with the bill, and it hadn't happened.
[01:28:37.113 --> 01:28:42.676]  But they're working, Paul's writing two, three articles a day, Steve's writing one or two a day, Kurt's writing articles a day, updating the sites,
[01:28:43.695 --> 01:28:47.236]  I may have the money to hire some more webmasters and writers, but I'm scared to hire people.
[01:28:47.676 --> 01:28:49.557]  And by scared, I'm scared of not completing my mission.
[01:28:50.197 --> 01:28:52.017]  I mean, there are infiltrators, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:52.918 --> 01:28:54.178]  There are a lot of infiltrators.
[01:28:55.798 --> 01:28:58.139]  And, uh, you know, it's not pretty.
[01:28:58.159 --> 01:29:02.160]  I mean, the feds will get in your office, and they'll come in here and commit crimes and then say, I did it!
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:06.241]  And they can come out in court that they even did it on their own, and it doesn't matter.
[01:29:06.261 --> 01:29:08.042]  The judge will say, it doesn't matter, we set you up.
[01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:14.411]  I know that's their fault and their evil, but that'll shut down what I'm doing.
[01:29:15.311 --> 01:29:16.532]  I mean, this isn't a game, folks.
[01:29:16.572 --> 01:29:17.452]  This is real.
[01:29:17.832 --> 01:29:19.432]  This is as hardcore as it gets.
[01:29:20.133 --> 01:29:23.534]  And I get all gutted up and fired up to do what I do every day, but this is real.
[01:29:23.994 --> 01:29:26.815]  Jason Burmas for the quick five-minute breaking news report.
[01:29:27.155 --> 01:29:30.016]  Straight ahead, more of your phone calls and a lot more.
[01:29:30.436 --> 01:29:31.316]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:31.416 --> 01:29:31.896]  Stay with us.
[01:29:31.956 --> 01:29:33.117]  Big announcements coming up.
[01:29:33.917 --> 01:29:34.817]  We're on the march.
[01:29:35.317 --> 01:29:36.918]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:37.838 --> 01:29:40.539]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:43.697 --> 01:29:45.258]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:45.398 --> 01:29:50.020]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.881]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:29:53.081 --> 01:29:55.962]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:29:56.142 --> 01:30:00.844]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:30:01.044 --> 01:30:01.324]  We're good.
[01:30:20.876 --> 01:30:26.961]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:34.267]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:30:34.287 --> 01:30:38.330]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:39.471]  Take action today.
[01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:41.413]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:30:44.218 --> 01:30:49.525]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:50.026 --> 01:30:57.015]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:30:57.606 --> 01:31:03.788]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:04.188 --> 01:31:06.028]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:06.168 --> 01:31:08.589]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:19.612]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:20.232 --> 01:31:21.512]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:21.913 --> 01:31:23.273]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:23.763 --> 01:31:30.091]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:30.671 --> 01:31:38.461]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:38.941 --> 01:31:40.083]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:40.523 --> 01:31:41.705]  The people strike back.
[01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:50.515]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:31:50.795 --> 01:32:06.268]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in
[01:32:06.588 --> 01:32:12.171]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts?
[01:32:12.371 --> 01:32:18.674]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:32:18.895 --> 01:32:22.537]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:32:22.777 --> 01:32:25.378]  Solar powered generators are finally available.
[01:32:25.478 --> 01:32:30.841]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:32:31.141 --> 01:32:33.765]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:33.825 --> 01:32:36.029]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:32:36.049 --> 01:32:38.513]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:42.840]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:32:58.866 --> 01:33:23.243]  I'm gonna chase the sky forever With the woman and the stallion and the wind And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder Before we ever pass this wave again And we're gonna rise
[01:33:26.198 --> 01:33:48.395]  All right, more of your calls coming up from Thomas, Steve, Charles, Tony, and John.
[01:33:48.415 --> 01:33:50.797]  That'll probably be all we can get to.
[01:33:51.357 --> 01:33:52.959]  Jason Burmas, will you hand me that flyswatter, please?
[01:33:54.377 --> 01:33:57.578]  You know, we have hundreds of emails pouring in telling us how to get rid of fruit flies.
[01:33:58.099 --> 01:33:59.359]  No one knows where they're coming from.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.361]  And they're just everywhere in here, landing on my face.
[01:34:03.461 --> 01:34:06.943]  And we got flypaper, and they don't like the flypaper.
[01:34:07.623 --> 01:34:09.244]  They don't care about the flypaper.
[01:34:10.124 --> 01:34:13.426]  They, uh... People are like, well, spray a bunch of poison.
[01:34:13.526 --> 01:34:14.746]  I don't want to breathe a bunch of poison.
[01:34:14.766 --> 01:34:15.627]  I'm not using it in here.
[01:34:16.287 --> 01:34:18.188]  You can keep your cancer for yourselves out there.
[01:34:19.735 --> 01:34:23.238]  You know, I was over at my parents' one weekend stand there, and I came in the house about midnight.
[01:34:23.258 --> 01:34:26.600]  A couple of roaches running around, big ones, you know, got around here.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.381]  It's been raining a lot.
[01:34:27.401 --> 01:34:28.001]  They come in the house.
[01:34:28.041 --> 01:34:31.864]  I just, I killed them with a, with a kitchen rag, popping them.
[01:34:32.665 --> 01:34:38.810]  I could have gone and got poison out from under the counter, but no, I don't feel like killing them and killing myself, killing myself to live.
[01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:41.832]  Okay, now I'm going into extermination, ancient exterminating tactics.
[01:34:42.813 --> 01:34:46.375]  That's how they used to kill locusts, was like these big, big switches.
[01:34:48.844 --> 01:34:51.686]  Hand-killing the insects.
[01:34:51.766 --> 01:34:52.687]  Okay, let's get serious.
[01:34:52.727 --> 01:34:56.669]  Let me reset here for just a moment because I want to get to this with Burmese and then get to your calls.
[01:34:58.050 --> 01:35:03.553]  It has come out with top virologists in England, the United States, Canada, Australia.
[01:35:03.593 --> 01:35:06.775]  We got two articles, one up at InfoWars.com, one at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:06.815 --> 01:35:08.797]  Just recapping this and then the new breaking news in a moment.
[01:35:09.597 --> 01:35:10.758]  It has come out
[01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:23.582]  It has come out that Tamiflu developers' swine flu may have been released from a lab.
[01:35:23.602 --> 01:35:26.803]  And then there's another article dealing with that.
[01:35:27.804 --> 01:35:31.566]  So the point is, H1N1 virus manufactured as a result of human error.
[01:35:31.606 --> 01:35:37.529]  They're saying clearly it has the markers, it has no pedigree, it wasn't mutated naturally, because they can track these viruses.
[01:35:38.169 --> 01:35:44.914]  It just came out of the blue, wrong flu season, wrong hemisphere, which is also why I say it didn't escape from some lab.
[01:35:44.934 --> 01:35:45.895]  This thing had to be spread.
[01:35:46.255 --> 01:35:49.278]  So this is only a whitewash one level, but we're proving right again.
[01:35:49.618 --> 01:35:52.160]  Will we see retractions from CNN and others that attacked us?
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:52.880]  No.
[01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:57.942]  But now we know why they're mainly taking down the swine flu videos I did that are on YouTube.
[01:35:58.262 --> 01:36:00.363]  Suspending the accounts of the videos everywhere.
[01:36:00.623 --> 01:36:01.003]  It's me!
[01:36:01.083 --> 01:36:02.464]  I'm allowed to get on TV and talk.
[01:36:02.784 --> 01:36:04.984]  I'm telling people they can post it, but YouTube says no.
[01:36:05.464 --> 01:36:07.305]  They don't even do copyright infringements now.
[01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:08.245]  They just take your channel down.
[01:36:08.605 --> 01:36:09.406]  Happened to Nate Evans.
[01:36:09.426 --> 01:36:10.486]  Happened to all the people I know.
[01:36:11.146 --> 01:36:12.426]  This is a badge of honor, I think.
[01:36:13.507 --> 01:36:15.747]  And Burmese, you kept saying they were going to get rid of Google Videos.
[01:36:15.767 --> 01:36:17.648]  We'll talk about that in a moment, but right now, briefly,
[01:36:18.675 --> 01:36:28.120]  I remember this in the extras of Oliver Stone's JFK, because a new director's edition came out a few years ago, and I watched it on the treadmill.
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:30.642]  That's how I watch movies, you know, in like a two-part series.
[01:36:30.682 --> 01:36:33.223]  An hour on the treadmill, then another hour on the treadmill the next day.
[01:36:34.163 --> 01:36:43.989]  And I remember them talking about how Castro, how a type of flu, a type of fever, swine fever, had been released in Cuba.
[01:36:45.134 --> 01:36:48.435]  And then it came out years later in the mainstream news, and that's declassified.
[01:36:48.495 --> 01:36:49.175]  I'd forgotten.
[01:36:49.675 --> 01:36:53.196]  You got an email, got a tip, pulled up the San Francisco Chronicle article, it's confirmed.
[01:36:53.276 --> 01:36:56.696]  So, 76 it pops up on a military base.
[01:36:56.716 --> 01:36:57.797]  1918 it comes out of a U.S.
[01:36:57.817 --> 01:36:58.457]  military base.
[01:36:59.237 --> 01:37:00.857]  This new one, created in a lab.
[01:37:00.937 --> 01:37:02.017]  No doubt about that now.
[01:37:02.597 --> 01:37:04.938]  And who's used this stuff before?
[01:37:05.378 --> 01:37:07.658]  The CIA and against Latin America.
[01:37:08.059 --> 01:37:09.539]  These guys never stop.
[01:37:11.188 --> 01:37:15.469]  Every time there's a terror attack, we don't just say it's the government or our government or some other western government.
[01:37:16.349 --> 01:37:17.650]  We go look at the history.
[01:37:18.130 --> 01:37:19.430]  We go look at who's done it before.
[01:37:19.490 --> 01:37:32.834]  It's like, if some guy robs a bank and does it a certain way, and the files show that a bank robber was released a year ago in the same area who robs banks, you know, 20 years before, the same way, I'm going to go looking for him.
[01:37:34.522 --> 01:37:37.123]  I mean, and they have the motive, and they have the know-how.
[01:37:37.203 --> 01:37:38.623]  Burmess, give us the latest development.
[01:37:38.803 --> 01:37:40.984]  Yeah, so in 1971, the U.S.
[01:37:42.104 --> 01:37:52.906]  Central Intelligence Agency officials, operatives linked to anti-Castro terrorists, introduced African swine fever virus into Cuba, and they had to slaughter 500,000 pigs.
[01:37:52.946 --> 01:37:54.907]  Now, the only difference between this and the swine flu
[01:37:55.587 --> 01:37:57.468]  Is that it cannot be transmitted to humans.
[01:37:57.748 --> 01:38:01.030]  But this was actually broken by Newsday, which is a big paper out of New York.
[01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.850]  I use it all the time.
[01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:06.112]  A lot of those hard articles in my film Fabled Enemies are cut directly out of there.
[01:38:06.132 --> 01:38:09.033]  This was a bio-attack on the farming industry.
[01:38:09.053 --> 01:38:10.254]  This was an economic attack.
[01:38:11.194 --> 01:38:22.745]  And a big part of declassified warfare with the Russians and the US, basically run by the same people now we discover, in the past, is crops, is insects, is engineered insects.
[01:38:23.786 --> 01:38:29.931]  They drop insects out of a plane that don't just eat your crops, and they've done this before, but carry a virus or bacteria that kills your crops.
[01:38:30.191 --> 01:38:32.512]  Yeah, and affects the wildlife around them as well.
[01:38:33.153 --> 01:38:45.520]  What's really interesting is there's four different CIA officials speaking on record here, they won't give their names, but it runs through places like Fort Gullick, an army base near Panama Canal Zone, of course the U.S.
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.061]  Navy base at Guantanamo.
[01:38:47.481 --> 01:39:15.840]  was used to traffic this and then the final place I think it was right here the source of the traveler who had been trained by the CIA and carried out previous missions for the agency said he saw no CIA officials aboard the boat that delivered the virus to the trawler in Panama but added we were well paid for this and Cuban exile groups don't have that kind of money his account was confirmed by another intelligence source in Miami you know it goes on to talk about Venezuela but basically again 1971 Jones
[01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:23.404]  Almost 40 years ago, they're releasing a similar bioweapon in a third world nation they're having problems with.
[01:39:23.745 --> 01:39:26.126]  And then we have this swine flu just totally emerged.
[01:39:26.286 --> 01:39:30.068]  First they blame Mexico, then they don't have any pigs that have it in Mexico.
[01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:36.512]  Then they, then it, what was it, two weeks ago now, they said, oh, we finally found the first pig with swine flu, and it was in Canada.
[01:39:37.072 --> 01:39:45.156]  And then you have this, uh, this witch for the CFR who did that, uh, swine flu, the fear and flu article right there, and she's saying... It's right over there, Jones, if you're looking for it.
[01:39:45.457 --> 01:39:47.638]  It's right under that, uh, top magazine right there.
[01:39:47.878 --> 01:39:48.198]  You see it?
[01:39:48.238 --> 01:39:48.718]  The black one?
[01:39:49.058 --> 01:39:50.519]  Yeah, yeah, the little piggy snout.
[01:39:50.539 --> 01:39:51.500]  Yeah, the little piggy snout.
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:53.361]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:53.401 --> 01:39:56.462]  And she's saying that the swine flu wasn't made in a lab.
[01:39:56.502 --> 01:39:59.843]  And if you believe that, by the way, Jones, you're a conspiracy theorist and a bad person.
[01:40:00.063 --> 01:40:01.904]  But it was founded in America.
[01:40:01.944 --> 01:40:03.245]  And then she attacks Lou Dobbs.
[01:40:03.465 --> 01:40:06.286]  There hasn't been a single case of swine flu in a pig in America.
[01:40:06.746 --> 01:40:12.828]  And that woman who died, that 33-year-old woman, the Texas health officials admit she didn't die from swine flu.
[01:40:12.868 --> 01:40:15.109]  That child who died, he had chronic illnesses.
[01:40:15.389 --> 01:40:16.310]  No, she was sick.
[01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:17.250]  She was already dying.
[01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.530]  Yeah.
[01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:18.030]  All right.
[01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:19.071]  Key information.
[01:40:19.091 --> 01:40:20.531]  Let's get a blurb by Curt Nemo.
[01:40:21.994 --> 01:40:24.376]  Paul Watson or Steve Watson or you or somebody.
[01:40:24.736 --> 01:40:25.977]  TheInfoWarrior.com.
[01:40:26.157 --> 01:40:29.779]  You'll go ahead and just get that posted, at least the old San Francisco Chronicle article.
[01:40:30.079 --> 01:40:31.500]  Jason, thanks for coming in to talk to us.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:31.860]  Thank you.
[01:40:32.721 --> 01:40:33.001]  You bet.
[01:40:33.321 --> 01:40:42.287]  All right, coming up in about five, six, seven minutes, I'm going to have Rob Dew in here because he worked on one of these new presentations, these new films we're going to be releasing today.
[01:40:42.307 --> 01:40:45.088]  So I'll be announcing that coming up in a few minutes.
[01:40:45.108 --> 01:40:45.749]  We are now
[01:40:47.756 --> 01:40:49.878]  Three hours, 41 minutes into the transmission.
[01:40:49.898 --> 01:40:53.141]  I want to thank a few of the sponsors we've got that have made this show possible.
[01:40:53.161 --> 01:40:54.062]  Then I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:40:54.502 --> 01:40:55.523]  One of them is HomeGain.
[01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:56.864]  Wonderful folks.
[01:40:57.365 --> 01:40:59.527]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[01:40:59.567 --> 01:41:02.069]  HomeGain, as in gaining, dot com.
[01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.930]  HomeGain dot com.
[01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:04.031]  They have a Street View system.
[01:41:04.811 --> 01:41:06.492]  For helping sell your home or finding out its value.
[01:41:06.512 --> 01:41:14.157]  They have a system where you can enter in your home's address and it will tell you instantly what the value of your home is.
[01:41:14.197 --> 01:41:20.641]  They have a home sale maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[01:41:21.121 --> 01:41:24.744]  For 10 years these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers and most important it is free.
[01:41:25.224 --> 01:41:25.864]  It is free.
[01:41:26.304 --> 01:41:27.445]  They're advertiser driven.
[01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:29.206]  So you can find a realtor there as well.
[01:41:29.306 --> 01:41:30.287]  It is homegain.com.
[01:41:32.190 --> 01:41:33.391]  Also another fine sponsor.
[01:41:33.891 --> 01:41:39.256]  In these uncertain times, people are insane who don't have gold, silver, firearms, storable foods, water filters.
[01:41:39.596 --> 01:41:43.299]  And they have high quality water filters, all sorts of great things at really low prices.
[01:41:43.639 --> 01:41:49.404]  The best storable foods out there, non-GMO, non-hybrid, and they're the biggest, longest continually operating storable foods.
[01:41:49.924 --> 01:41:51.545]  Another sponsor I want to tell you about.
[01:41:51.585 --> 01:41:54.128]  I'm doing two days of these because I didn't do them yesterday, all these great folks.
[01:41:54.168 --> 01:41:54.388]  Ringtones.
[01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:56.509]  On InfoWars.com we've added a new ringtone store.
[01:42:16.650 --> 01:42:19.071]  Turn your phone into part of the InfoWar.
[01:42:19.111 --> 01:42:23.292]  You can get dozens of ringtones that will wake up everyone around you.

[01:42:29.013 --> 01:42:29.914]  You can listen to them for free.
[01:42:30.414 --> 01:42:35.475]  Go to the Square Banner on InfoWars.com or go to the AlexJonesRingtones.com.

[01:42:42.857 --> 01:42:43.317]  The sheep.
[01:42:43.738 --> 01:42:44.538]  We are under attack.
[01:42:44.578 --> 01:42:44.978]  Mayday.
[01:42:44.998 --> 01:42:46.459]  9-1-1 was an inside job.
[01:42:46.759 --> 01:42:49.161]  Let your phone wake up people around you.
[01:42:49.581 --> 01:42:51.242]  You want to contribute to the InfoWar.
[01:42:51.262 --> 01:42:52.282]  This is a great way.
[01:42:52.622 --> 01:42:58.766]  Let Alex Jones repeat 9-1-1 was an inside job over and over again to the people around you every time your cell phone rings.
[01:42:59.066 --> 01:43:03.708]  This will be sure to spark up conversation and give you the opportunity to tell people about the InfoWar.
[01:43:03.728 --> 01:43:07.390]  Remember, go to the AlexJonesRingtones.com.
[01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:08.731]  That's AlexJonesRingtones.com today.
[01:43:11.081 --> 01:43:17.343]  And then finally, one more sponsor I want to tell you about that's made this show possible is acolablue.com.
[01:43:17.483 --> 01:43:21.104]  The best price and the best atmospheric water purifier out there.
[01:43:21.464 --> 01:43:22.924]  Seven and a half gallons a day.
[01:43:23.785 --> 01:43:24.965]  Great deals on these.
[01:43:25.045 --> 01:43:30.707]  acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O, blue.com, or 800-691-6043.
[01:43:30.747 --> 01:43:37.308]  It runs through seven filters, including reverse osmosis, carbon, UV, antibacterial, fungal, UV light.
[01:43:38.069 --> 01:43:38.989]  Just amazing grabbing.
[01:43:39.429 --> 01:43:39.910]  We're good to go.
[01:43:59.308 --> 01:44:04.492]  Let's go ahead now and get to more of these calls, and I'll also do that in the final segment.
[01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:07.694]  Let's talk to Thomas in California.
[01:44:07.734 --> 01:44:09.075]  Thomas, you're on the air.
[01:44:09.135 --> 01:44:09.456]  Welcome.
[01:44:10.717 --> 01:44:11.317]  Hi, Alex.
[01:44:11.357 --> 01:44:13.799]  Greetings from the sunny Central California coast.
[01:44:14.319 --> 01:44:14.860]  Greetings.
[01:44:16.201 --> 01:44:24.447]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, like, you know, you hear a lot of people talking about, well, you know, no one's out there doing anything, no one's out there fighting.
[01:44:25.876 --> 01:44:32.041]  You know, we should just either give up or we should go and shoot everybody because we're not having any victories.
[01:44:32.221 --> 01:44:37.505]  And it seems to me that, you know, you may not see it on the news media because that's the last thing you're going to see.
[01:44:37.525 --> 01:44:38.446]  You stole my thunder.
[01:44:38.486 --> 01:44:40.407]  They never tell you you have any chance to beat them.
[01:44:40.788 --> 01:44:43.770]  They want to destroy our morals and come out and go, yeah, we're criminals.
[01:44:44.050 --> 01:44:45.411]  Yeah, we stole $14 trillion.
[01:44:45.431 --> 01:44:46.472]  I won't tell you where it is.
[01:44:47.853 --> 01:44:49.675]  They want to make you capitulate.
[01:44:50.615 --> 01:44:53.998]  As soon as you find an issue and you decide to enter that fight,
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.702]  You will find people coming out of the woodworks trying to help you.
[01:44:58.102 --> 01:45:01.224]  You will find so many groups on that issue all fighting it.
[01:45:01.665 --> 01:45:03.566]  All having so many victories here.
[01:45:04.026 --> 01:45:06.328]  So many victories there in their own little ways.
[01:45:06.668 --> 01:45:08.089]  But of course the news doesn't cover it.
[01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:14.453]  And of course, I mean, look at where we'd be if after the Iraq War people didn't take to the streets by the millions.
[01:45:14.833 --> 01:45:16.454]  We already would have invaded Iran.
[01:45:16.754 --> 01:45:18.035]  We would have already invaded Syria.
[01:45:18.195 --> 01:45:19.175]  Exactly!
[01:45:19.195 --> 01:45:28.499]  Look, Tokyo Rose would tell the G.I.s, even when Japan was defeated, they'd broadcast on the radio, America's defeated, you've lost, you can't win, it's all over for you.
[01:45:28.559 --> 01:45:38.184]  And some G.I.s, even though they knew that Japan was blown to bits and about to be physically invaded, this is weeks before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some G.I.s actually believed it.
[01:45:38.764 --> 01:45:42.146]  It's the same thing, they tell you, there's no hope, there's no way to beat it, there's nothing you can do.
[01:45:42.486 --> 01:45:42.986]  Baloney.
[01:45:43.106 --> 01:45:44.027]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:44.904 --> 01:45:49.910]  I'm even going to overdrive today because I want to get to Steve, Charles, Tony, John and others and we'll try to cram you in.
[01:45:50.251 --> 01:45:53.235]  I got two trailers to play and I'm almost out of time to do this.
[01:45:53.875 --> 01:46:00.864]  Number one, because this is a bigger announcement because we're going to have one of these every month, but the next announcement is even bigger individually.
[01:46:01.866 --> 01:46:03.247]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:04.383 --> 01:46:10.709]  Another weapon in the Fight for Freedom DVD arsenal, the Alex Jones Show, Volume 1, January 2009.
[01:46:10.769 --> 01:46:15.454]  Every week or two, a new one, up to Catching Up, to six months in, will be out.
[01:46:15.474 --> 01:46:20.259]  And by the end of the year, we're going to have twelve of these, and you can get them all together. $14.95.
[01:46:22.481 --> 01:46:23.762]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:54.522]  This is now manufactured.
[01:46:54.542 --> 01:47:00.223]  This came in earlier in the week when it came in Monday and so we have these in.
[01:47:00.923 --> 01:47:08.646]  The next film is going to be in here in a week but it won't ship till June 3rd and that's a totally separate film so
[01:47:10.886 --> 01:47:12.467]  Now again, this is really a presentation.
[01:47:12.527 --> 01:47:14.268]  The film, I'll tell you about in the next segment.
[01:47:14.848 --> 01:47:16.009]  But this is a big announcement.
[01:47:16.429 --> 01:47:16.989]  Great way.
[01:47:17.009 --> 01:47:18.350]  You can see David Icke there on the cover.
[01:47:18.590 --> 01:47:25.413]  This is the first month, and it's the David Icke, Joe Rogan, Alan Watt, Gerald Cilente, Arte Cerveda, that's the Austin Police Chief.
[01:47:26.073 --> 01:47:27.574]  This is really power-packed.
[01:47:28.174 --> 01:47:31.376]  Rob Due and Jason Douglas have been working on these.
[01:47:31.676 --> 01:47:33.477]  Tell folks about the new DVD arsenal.
[01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:42.272]  This has been really a treat, and basically when you hired me, you said, look, I need you to spearhead this project, and me and Jason really took it on.
[01:47:42.432 --> 01:47:48.194]  We've been poring over all these interviews that you do, trying to find the best parts of each interview.
[01:47:48.634 --> 01:47:52.655]  We look at a calendar to see who you had that month, and we really find the best ones.
[01:47:55.316 --> 01:47:56.517]  A lot of the fluff in the article.
[01:47:56.537 --> 01:48:00.521]  It gets down to the nitty-gritty, you know, the real good information that people can get.
[01:48:00.561 --> 01:48:02.462]  Yeah, you guys shouldn't just hack this stuff out.
[01:48:02.502 --> 01:48:04.104]  It's all edited, condensed.
[01:48:04.144 --> 01:48:06.486]  It's kind of like a video reader's digest.
[01:48:06.646 --> 01:48:07.246]  It really is.
[01:48:07.306 --> 01:48:07.787]  It really is.
[01:48:07.847 --> 01:48:11.510]  And it's really something you could take and say, wow, this is kind of what was going on this month.
[01:48:12.271 --> 01:48:18.176]  You know, that month it was a lot about expanding your mind and how to break yourself out of that mental prison.
[01:48:18.396 --> 01:48:23.761]  Next month is all about, like, February, is all about personal freedom and state sovereignty.
[01:48:23.781 --> 01:48:29.445]  Yeah, we've got Russell Means, and next month is just a printout because the DVDs aren't here yet, so this isn't on sale yet.
[01:48:29.726 --> 01:48:32.027]  These are in, you can buy this right now, I just went up minutes ago.
[01:48:33.249 --> 01:48:42.977]  This has got Russell Means, Lindsey Williams, Edwin Vieira, Sean Kassinger, Craig Proudly, and State Sovereignty Special.
[01:48:43.337 --> 01:48:44.838]  A whole bunch of state reps on this one.
[01:48:45.839 --> 01:48:48.401]  Five state reps, the best of those interviews put together.
[01:48:48.461 --> 01:48:53.884]  And it really gives you a good history into the state sovereignty movement, where it's going.
[01:48:54.325 --> 01:48:55.566]  And we're already working on March.
[01:48:55.626 --> 01:48:56.566]  March is almost done.
[01:48:56.606 --> 01:48:59.428]  Here's Chuck Norris.
[01:48:59.508 --> 01:49:04.351]  Chuck Norris, Webster Tarbley, John McManus, Judge Napolitano, Professor George Grayson.
[01:49:05.212 --> 01:49:06.273]  Just amazing work.
[01:49:06.753 --> 01:49:17.596]  So we've really been, you know, working hard on these and what I think is really cool is the beginning of each one we specially produced a little segment that you're really not going to see anywhere else.
[01:49:18.216 --> 01:49:24.618]  The first one we took a speech that Alex gave at a 9-11 Truth.
[01:49:24.638 --> 01:49:25.498]  Yeah, go ahead and roll this.
[01:49:25.518 --> 01:49:26.858]  This is from the January edition.
[01:49:26.918 --> 01:49:28.779]  Intro, start rolling and we'll go out to break with this.
[01:49:28.799 --> 01:49:32.560]  The man makes me proud to be an American.
[01:49:42.349 --> 01:49:48.231]  A lot of people before us sacrificed and died in the defense of liberty and the fight against tyranny.
[01:49:48.851 --> 01:49:52.332]  A lot of people died so we have the little bit of freedoms we've got!
[01:49:52.732 --> 01:49:53.572]  They're precious!
[01:49:53.732 --> 01:49:55.953]  They were paid for in blood!
[01:49:57.934 --> 01:50:04.696]  I want you to take action, because they can kill us individually, but they cannot kill ideas!
[01:50:09.073 --> 01:50:10.853]  Ideas are eternal.
[01:50:11.454 --> 01:50:14.234]  Ideas, when they're the truth, are invincible.
[01:50:14.454 --> 01:50:16.635]  And ideas are bulletproof!
[01:50:17.335 --> 01:50:23.876]  And I'm here to tell you, I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good job.
[01:50:23.996 --> 01:50:25.977]  I've done nothing but my duty!
[01:50:26.617 --> 01:50:36.979]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people, and I've been fighting them for 13 years, and I'll never stop while I'm drawing breath!
[01:50:40.006 --> 01:50:43.210]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:50:43.850 --> 01:50:45.492]  Hello, this is Steve Schenk.
[01:50:45.712 --> 01:50:50.137]  You might not be able to spell Constitution, but you sure know how important it is.
[01:50:50.738 --> 01:50:56.304]  You might not be missing any shirts from your closet, but you have given the shirt off your back hundreds of times.
[01:50:56.894 --> 01:51:01.841]  You might not understand the thousands of laws that exist, but you do live by the Ten Commandments.
[01:51:02.402 --> 01:51:08.290]  You might not know who the bad guys are, or what you should be complaining about, but you do know what to be thankful for.
[01:51:08.691 --> 01:51:12.156]  You might not be looking for a government handout, but you do know how to
[01:51:16.892 --> 01:51:20.734]  You don't know, but you do know that you want to take care of your family.
[01:51:21.095 --> 01:51:22.435]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:22.736 --> 01:51:26.638]  You might not be able to own a farm, but you can have the food that came from one.
[01:51:26.978 --> 01:51:30.140]  eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633.
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:35.784]  We're thankful for the chance to lend a hand with food for you and your family.
[01:51:36.284 --> 01:51:38.586]  On the web, eFoodsDirect.com or call 800-409-5633.
[01:51:44.182 --> 01:51:49.410]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:51:50.214 --> 01:51:55.558]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:51:56.099 --> 01:52:02.283]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:02.503 --> 01:52:04.405]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:04.565 --> 01:52:06.947]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:52:07.027 --> 01:52:17.915]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.461]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:21.861 --> 01:52:23.282]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:23.722 --> 01:52:30.027]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:38.893 --> 01:52:40.053]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:40.474 --> 01:52:41.735]  The people strike back.
[01:52:43.416 --> 01:52:44.296]  Ah, springtime.
[01:52:44.717 --> 01:52:49.880]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[01:52:50.213 --> 01:52:54.677]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:52:54.838 --> 01:53:00.563]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[01:53:00.804 --> 01:53:09.112]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[01:53:09.412 --> 01:53:12.094]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[01:53:12.394 --> 01:53:22.862]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:32.790]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas, roaches, crickets, and more, and safe enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.
[01:53:33.090 --> 01:53:35.032]  Order now from FreshwaterOrganics.com

[01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:57.062]  And everybody requested it.
[01:53:57.082 --> 01:54:01.344]  You know, Aaron Russo told me, I may not make it with this cancer.
[01:54:02.545 --> 01:54:04.186]  And I want you to come interview me.
[01:54:04.206 --> 01:54:04.706]  It's his idea.
[01:54:06.365 --> 01:54:08.826]  We talked about Nick Rockefeller on the air and stuff, and it was important.
[01:54:09.406 --> 01:54:10.366]  He was down in Houston.
[01:54:10.386 --> 01:54:13.687]  He'd had cancer for four years, had scores of surgeries.
[01:54:13.707 --> 01:54:15.028]  He could hardly walk when I got there.
[01:54:15.048 --> 01:54:15.968]  He couldn't do it the first day.
[01:54:15.988 --> 01:54:16.528]  He was supposed to.
[01:54:16.548 --> 01:54:18.509]  We had to wait a day, and we did it the next day.
[01:54:18.549 --> 01:54:19.509]  He wouldn't talk about that on air.
[01:54:19.529 --> 01:54:20.889]  I mean, he could hardly walk.
[01:54:21.190 --> 01:54:24.751]  He's in pain during the interview, and it's the last videotaped interview with Aaron Russo.
[01:54:25.391 --> 01:54:29.712]  And we released large parts of it to PrisonPlanet.tv, and on the web, there's millions of views of it.
[01:54:29.752 --> 01:54:30.833]  I mean, it's all over the place.
[01:54:30.973 --> 01:54:31.373]  Millions.
[01:54:31.813 --> 01:54:33.513]  One will have a million views, one 600,000 views, one 300,000 views.
[01:54:35.754 --> 01:54:58.824]  Versions of it, but there was a lot of the interview that we didn't release and there was You know even stuff with us arguing behind the scenes a little bit about this point or that point and also we interviewed him when we went to dinner with him and That's in there and it's 90 minutes and I did little two-minute updates four or five times six times in the film Where I tie in what he said then two years ago with what's now happening today?
[01:54:59.504 --> 01:55:01.605]  so it is a 91 minute film
[01:55:03.447 --> 01:55:04.468]  And let's go ahead and punch it up.
[01:55:04.568 --> 01:55:07.830]  It is a legacy of freedom that we'll live on.
[01:55:08.411 --> 01:55:10.392]  You can pre-order that, but it ships June 3rd.
[01:55:10.412 --> 01:55:12.194]  These come in next week, so we'll be packing them up.

[01:55:26.484 --> 01:55:28.847]  Uh, and our Ace of Eta and myself, of course.
[01:55:29.328 --> 01:55:35.575]  So, uh, but, but, but this, this, we spent a month or so, you know, taking the old interview on the tapes.
[01:55:35.615 --> 01:55:39.599]  It's in high quality, you know, it's shot, uh, in high def.
[01:55:40.945 --> 01:55:43.827]  Of course, it's condensed to a regular DVD, but it has that high-def look.
[01:55:44.268 --> 01:55:47.070]  It's got all this new documentation, video put over Aaron.
[01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:51.714]  And it talks about in the Fed, and how we got rid of the bankers, and a call to action.
[01:55:52.254 --> 01:55:53.375]  Very important film.
[01:55:53.895 --> 01:55:55.717]  People kept requesting this for the last two years.
[01:55:55.737 --> 01:55:56.738]  Hey, put that on DVD.
[01:55:56.758 --> 01:55:58.079]  And I said, hey, it's free on the Internet.

[01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:14.271]  Let's go ahead and play that trailer right now.
[01:56:14.391 --> 01:56:16.012]  Here is the trailer.
[01:56:16.852 --> 01:56:18.713]  It's actually on that Yahoo Shopping Cart page.
[01:56:18.733 --> 01:56:19.193]  Yeah, here it is.
[01:56:19.393 --> 01:56:20.234]  We've got it up on YouTube.
[01:56:20.254 --> 01:56:22.855]  Let's have this go viral before they delete it.
[01:56:23.395 --> 01:56:23.675]  Who knows?
[01:56:23.695 --> 01:56:25.536]  Maybe I'm not allowed to show my interview with Aaron Russo.
[01:56:25.896 --> 01:56:26.817]  Anyways, back it up.
[01:56:26.857 --> 01:56:27.437]  Back it up.
[01:56:27.477 --> 01:56:28.878]  Let's start it over here because I was talking.
[01:56:29.338 --> 01:56:31.659]  Again, here it is while it's on YouTube.
[01:56:31.719 --> 01:56:32.480]  See it while you can.
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:33.100]  Here's the trailer.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:33.380]  Here it is.
[01:56:35.781 --> 01:56:41.023]  Aaron Russo, the founder of a nationwide movement to end the private Federal Reserve.
[01:56:42.064 --> 01:56:43.104]  They have all the money they want.
[01:56:43.144 --> 01:56:44.404]  They can make all the money they want.
[01:56:45.285 --> 01:56:46.205]  They have a machine.
[01:56:46.225 --> 01:56:47.286]  They can make all the money.
[01:56:47.306 --> 01:56:48.906]  It's not about money.
[01:56:49.386 --> 01:56:50.247]  It's about control.
[01:56:50.327 --> 01:56:52.508]  It's about their vision of how they want to see the world.
[01:56:52.748 --> 01:56:55.829]  This was Aaron Russo's final videotaped interview.
[01:56:56.229 --> 01:57:03.572]  The whole agenda is to create a one world government where everybody has an RFID chip implanted in them.
[01:57:04.452 --> 01:57:07.213]  All money is to be in those chips.
[01:57:07.873 --> 01:57:09.574]  And this is getting me straight from Rockefeller himself.
[01:57:09.614 --> 01:57:10.854]  This is what they want to accomplish.
[01:57:10.874 --> 01:57:14.015]  We've never before seen sections of the historic interview.
[01:57:14.295 --> 01:57:16.316]  Ferris Air was poison to our country.
[01:57:16.336 --> 01:57:18.597]  Aaron, what do you think women's liberation was about?
[01:57:19.077 --> 01:57:20.577]  We the Rockefellers funded that.
[01:57:21.297 --> 01:57:22.478]  We funded women's liberation.
[01:57:23.203 --> 01:57:24.384]  They do whatever they want to do.
[01:57:24.644 --> 01:57:27.267]  What we want doesn't matter anymore.
[01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:29.709]  It's their agenda, it's their plans that matter.
[01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:36.074]  What happened on 9-11 is a phony, you know?
[01:57:36.174 --> 01:57:37.716]  And we've never learned the truth about 9-11.
[01:57:37.936 --> 01:57:40.919]  You hear George Bush saying democracy means freedom.
[01:57:41.607 --> 01:57:41.827]  No.
[01:57:42.387 --> 01:57:44.408]  Democracy equals New World Order.
[01:57:44.708 --> 01:57:49.729]  I believe God put me on this earth to be the best person I could be, and put everybody on this earth to be the best they could be.
[01:57:49.989 --> 01:57:51.850]  You have to stand up for what's right in life.
[01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:54.331]  And unless you do that, you're nothing.
[01:57:55.611 --> 01:57:56.771]  Reflections and Warnings.
[01:57:57.351 --> 01:57:58.732]  An interview with Aaron Russo.
[01:58:00.092 --> 01:58:01.733]  Coming to The InfoWar, June 3rd, 2009.
[01:58:06.764 --> 01:58:08.305]  All right, I'm not going to do overdrive.
[01:58:08.365 --> 01:58:11.508]  I promise to Charles and Tony and John and Steve and everybody.
[01:58:11.969 --> 01:58:12.930]  Call me tomorrow.
[01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:13.930]  You'll go ahead of the line.
[01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.891]  Great job, Rob Dew.
[01:58:15.131 --> 01:58:17.754]  Hey, what do you think of the new... You've seen the new Aaron Russo film?
[01:58:18.134 --> 01:58:20.836]  I came in this one morning and watched the whole thing.
[01:58:20.876 --> 01:58:21.817]  I mean, it was awesome.
[01:58:21.857 --> 01:58:23.859]  There's nobody here in the office and I just sat down and watched.
[01:58:23.879 --> 01:58:24.700]  It was great.
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:25.380]  God bless you all.
[01:58:25.461 --> 01:58:26.001]  Get it on DVD.
[01:58:28.941 --> 01:58:31.484]  Transmission continues!
[01:58:31.884 --> 01:58:33.666]  Infowars.com, get it?
[01:58:33.706 --> 01:58:42.075]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:58:42.135 --> 01:58:47.721]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:58:48.161 --> 01:58:51.845]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals
[01:58:52.398 --> 01:58:52.679]  I think so.
[01:59:07.827 --> 01:59:08.287]  We're good to go.
