[00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:01.791]  Big Brother.
[00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:03.492]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:05.334]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:06.795]  You want answers?
[00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:08.497]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:12.801]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:17.385]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:26.500]  Hello, my friends, and thank you for joining us in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.164]  We are now simulcasting live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:34.586]  Not only are we streaming this transmission out of the radio studio live,
[00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:37.847]  Simulcasting on television.
[00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:43.974]  We also archive this for PrisonPlanet.tv members within a few hours of the show for a download.
[00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:46.017]  So again, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:49.821]  This is the first live broadcast of the new year.
[00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:50.482]  It is January 2, 2009.
[00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:54.887]  We have two hours left spanning out before us.
[00:00:54.907 --> 00:01:06.417]  We've got Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com with us for the next 20 minutes so we can finish taking your calls from Matt in the UK, Barry in California, Brian in Canada, Kim in Texas, and others.
[00:01:07.178 --> 00:01:11.541]  Then I'm going to get into all the hubbub about, does Barack Obama want your guns?
[00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:19.290]  The answer is he's voted for an absolute complete gun ban when he was a state senator in Illinois and when he was a U.S.
[00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.494]  senator he supported, of course, the absolute gun ban in D.C.
[00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:24.936]  And he calls that reasonable.
[00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:29.200]  And so he is the most anti-gun member of the Senate
[00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:35.185]  And we're going to play some clips of Joe Biden and others and their sickening statements coming up later in this hour.
[00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:39.868]  But right now, with Bob Chapman, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.210]  Matt, in the United Kingdom, you're on the air.
[00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.570]  Welcome.
[00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:47.854]  Good afternoon, good evening, sir, and a happy, gloomy New Year from Muslim UK.
[00:01:48.114 --> 00:01:48.655]  And hello, Bob.
[00:01:49.616 --> 00:01:51.157]  Yeah, my question is for Bob.
[00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:54.439]  You mentioned, obviously, about high unemployment, obviously, in the US.
[00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.322]  I don't know if you've obviously read the news on Alex's website.
[00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:04.531]  Basically we just lost like 25,000 people from the Woolworths group.
[00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:06.593]  I don't know if they've got any in the US.
[00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:10.634]  What do you reckon will happen in the UK?
[00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:14.755]  Do you reckon that they'll put out UK troops when the people start to realise and riot?
[00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.136]  Let me answer that and then have Bob answer it because I don't want to forget this point.
[00:02:18.496 --> 00:02:28.980]  They have announced in your major newspapers that they do have the British military ready for civil insurrection with the police and the police have been drilling with your military quietly for decades.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.141]  Now publicly that's been on British TV and in the British newspaper.
[00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:36.843]  Yes, Woolworths is the international department store chain.
[00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:37.843]  Bob Chapman, your comment.
[00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.808]  As you've said, this has been going on for a long time.
[00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.871]  The cordon is getting tighter and tighter in the UK.
[00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:48.332]  Unemployment is going up.
[00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:55.856]  The pound is under tremendous stress from failures in the banking system.
[00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.739]  I think it's going to get considerably worse.
[00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:06.803]  We cover England and other countries in the international forecast very thoroughly.
[00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:15.333]  And so we have a lot of up-to-date news and we get letters from people saying, gee, I live in England and I didn't know that, which makes me feel good.
[00:03:15.853 --> 00:03:21.077]  But England is really in for trouble and they have no weapons.
[00:03:21.637 --> 00:03:22.698]  They can't fight back.
[00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:30.904]  Some of these goofs even want to keep you from carrying a penknife in your pocket.
[00:03:31.653 --> 00:03:33.494]  Because they say the criminals are now used as a prize.
[00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:45.458]  No, every week I see a story where people break in, they're raping, they're killing, and if somebody pushes a thief out a window, or breaks a vase over their head, the police viciously charge them and send them to prison.
[00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:54.681]  I mean, what a predatory government, where you can't defend yourself, the police can't and won't defend yourself, and they get very upset if a slave even fist fights back.
[00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:58.702]  They want the message, you're not allowed to defend yourself, and it's an island country,
[00:03:59.162 --> 00:04:01.165]  That's true, and if I was living in England, I would emigrate.
[00:04:18.393 --> 00:04:28.849]  Yeah, I think island nations that don't have a lot of good agriculture because of their northern clines, it is one of the worst places to live, is it not, Bob?
[00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.471]  Absolutely.
[00:04:30.852 --> 00:04:32.675]  You've got too many things working against you.
[00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:45.566]  And you have a giant immigrant population that's been filled by the establishment with hatred of England, so they can use the immigrant population as a weapon against the indigenous people of Britannia.
[00:04:46.046 --> 00:04:47.768]  Alright, does that answer your question, Brian?
[00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:49.969]  Or Barry?
[00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.491]  Happy New Year to you guys.
[00:04:53.532 --> 00:04:54.493]  Yeah, happy New Year to you.
[00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:55.354]  Sorry to give you that news.
[00:04:55.374 --> 00:04:55.794]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.116 --> 00:04:59.157]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:03.120]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[00:05:03.717 --> 00:05:10.239]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing your food supplies.
[00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:22.723]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the 21st or 22nd of January, the new president would be forced by an international incident to make some unpopular decisions.
[00:05:23.704 --> 00:05:27.585]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:35.325]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation and availability of food distribution.
[00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:41.266]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow for shipping.
[00:05:41.886 --> 00:05:45.907]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[00:05:46.427 --> 00:05:47.787]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633

[00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:04.548]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.243]  Alright folks, we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv on the January 2nd, 2009 edition.
[00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:26.344]  Bob Chapman with us for the rest of this segment.
[00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:33.889]  I want to go to Barry, Brian, Kim, Scott, Ronnie, James, and others right now.
[00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:40.553]  Then I'm going to get into a bunch of other news we haven't detailed yet, and the situation we face with the disarmament of the American people.
[00:08:40.994 --> 00:08:46.217]  That's what the military has been quietly trained for for decades, and we're now hurtling towards that eventuality.
[00:08:46.257 --> 00:08:47.378]  But thank God the people
[00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:56.601]  They have now discovered this, have now found out about it, they know about Barack Obama's voting record, and they are waking up and buying firearms and ammunition in droves.
[00:08:56.661 --> 00:09:10.846]  The gun culture is being revived, like the Phoenix, out of the ashes, and I think if you have courage out there and get the word out, and if the police and military, at least portions of them, stick with the people, we may be able to avert this.
[00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:15.708]  But regardless, we're going into the future, and it is going to be a rocky time.
[00:09:16.508 --> 00:09:20.714]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:24.199]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Canada.
[00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:25.781]  Brian, you are on the air.
[00:09:26.261 --> 00:09:26.762]  Hi, Alex.
[00:09:27.243 --> 00:09:27.523]  Hello.
[00:09:28.304 --> 00:09:28.725]  How are you?
[00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:29.446]  Happy New Year.
[00:09:29.886 --> 00:09:30.347]  Happy New Year to you.
[00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:34.072]  We're doing pretty good under Dictator Harper here, all things considered.
[00:09:34.332 --> 00:09:49.602]  That's right, for those that don't know, not only are scores of towns in the United States under 24-hour curfew for the citizens from Arkansas to Oklahoma to areas in Kentucky, and we played a clip of that on Wednesday for people that didn't believe it from CNN.
[00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:55.626]  Up in Canada, for now a month, the Queen has declared basically political martial law.
[00:09:55.966 --> 00:10:03.411]  Reuters reported that she basically secretly ran the country, and that when Parliament was getting ready to kick Harper out, she just
[00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:07.573]  She just came in and trumped them all with her ace of spades.
[00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:08.033]  Go ahead.
[00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:15.575]  Well, I know that me, for myself, I made the personal decision to parole all of my bills and obligations until the end of January.
[00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:17.116]  What the heck, you know?
[00:10:17.996 --> 00:10:20.097]  I'd like to make some predictions on the coming year.
[00:10:20.777 --> 00:10:28.279]  I noticed going out and trying to procure myself some DVDs and books that up here in Canada it looks like there's some censorship going on.
[00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:31.600]  I had at least two video stores specified to me
[00:10:32.193 --> 00:10:37.017]  They had a phone call where they were requested to have Endgame, your video Alex, sent back.
[00:10:37.617 --> 00:10:39.899]  So I know that things are being taken off the shelf.
[00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:41.420]  They're trying to put us back to sleep.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.365]  I know I can let all the Infowarriors making comments on the internet know that they'll continue to be harassed.
[00:10:48.825 --> 00:10:54.349]  They'll continue to block you and they'll continue to actually try and copy us like somebody tried to do to me this year.
[00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:57.752]  I caught him with my French so I enjoyed that one quite a bit.
[00:10:58.312 --> 00:10:59.593]  But it kind of gave me
[00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:07.030]  a kind of inspiration to when they come on with their comments and say, well, all of you are goofy idiots and none of this matters.
[00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:12.551]  Well, if it didn't matter, you wouldn't have to go and find some Frenchman to try and imitate me.
[00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:15.592]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:16.572]  Let me break that down.
[00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:24.853]  The hardest place for us in the world, not Japan, not Australia, not Germany, not Russia, not Mexico.
[00:11:24.953 --> 00:11:27.574]  My videos ship out to all those places, no problem.
[00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:32.277]  UPS, FedEx, we've jumped through all these hoops.
[00:11:33.078 --> 00:11:36.801]  We mail our stuff in bulk so they can go through customs in Canada.
[00:11:37.102 --> 00:11:39.804]  They'll break it, they'll smash it, they'll mail it back to us.
[00:11:40.424 --> 00:11:46.810]  I've gone through Canadian customs, they knew exactly who I was, interrogated me for 15 hours, screaming at me, telling me I was evil.
[00:11:47.891 --> 00:11:52.174]  And yes, the Canadians have no idea how controlled their society is.
[00:11:52.214 --> 00:11:52.715]  Bob Chapman?
[00:11:54.509 --> 00:12:00.057]  Uh, the last time I was in Canada, I was held for four hours and was sent through the same crap that you did.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.223]  And I will never return to that country.
[00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:07.822]  They love it.
[00:12:07.862 --> 00:12:24.670]  I mean, it's like being, when you see some film about 1984, the way Secret Police Act, just laughing at you, I've got you, and I'm sending you to prison, you piece of bleeping garbage, and they're just like, and they just revel in their black uniforms, just laughing at you when you're cornered in there.
[00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.252]  I mean, you just can't imagine, and it's going to be like that here in the US.
[00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:30.952]  It is so sad, Bob.
[00:12:30.972 --> 00:12:36.595]  It certainly is, and you know, there was no reason for it.
[00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.212]  They just do what they want to do.
[00:12:39.852 --> 00:12:55.064]  You're on the list, and they take particular relish in working on me, because I used to work for the government, and I had a very responsible position.
[00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:56.525]  Yours is different.
[00:12:56.905 --> 00:12:59.767]  You're more outspoken and more circulated than I am.
[00:13:00.368 --> 00:13:04.311]  But they don't forget, anywhere I go in the world, I put up with the same thing.
[00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:07.240]  This is the global government.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.501]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:13:09.201 --> 00:13:11.022]  And again, the Canadian people are great folks.
[00:13:11.062 --> 00:13:14.524]  That's why this evil's been able to grow, because they're naive.
[00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.005]  They don't know what's happened.
[00:13:17.887 --> 00:13:18.087]  Hmm.
[00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:25.451]  How does the government find this type of scum who just enjoys abusing people and treating good people like crap?
[00:13:27.453 --> 00:13:30.955]  I don't know, but obviously they have no trouble doing so.
[00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:36.368]  I think a lot of them believe in what they're doing, but they don't understand what the problem is.
[00:13:37.329 --> 00:13:40.531]  And when you try to discuss it with them, which I'm sure you did,
[00:13:42.163 --> 00:13:46.185]  They said, you know, we just do what we have to do, what we're told to do.
[00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:48.146]  They don't even say that!
[00:13:48.366 --> 00:13:50.427]  They scream and laugh and say, shut up!
[00:13:51.187 --> 00:13:55.049]  And then demand you answer a question, and when you do, they scream and say, I said shut up!
[00:13:55.689 --> 00:13:58.250]  And then they say, you're going to one of our prisons, we can't wait.
[00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.851]  Do you know what we do to you in our prisons?
[00:14:01.412 --> 00:14:02.992]  And they just love the evil!
[00:14:03.032 --> 00:14:04.433]  They love hurting freedom!
[00:14:04.813 --> 00:14:06.414]  And I know why, in-game,
[00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:11.135]  We know that Google.ca, for most people, it says unavailable now.
[00:14:11.435 --> 00:14:13.895]  Also in France, most of my videos are unavailable.
[00:14:13.915 --> 00:14:16.816]  You've still got to go to Google.com to get to the U.S.
[00:14:16.836 --> 00:14:17.256]  servers.
[00:14:17.296 --> 00:14:18.736]  A lot of those are blocked worldwide.
[00:14:19.156 --> 00:14:25.097]  Endgame covers the fact that they basically kidnapped me for 15 hours until international media found out.
[00:14:25.357 --> 00:14:30.278]  And so the film starts with them kidnapping me, and so I guess that's why they don't want Endgame up in Canada.
[00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:33.619]  In all probability.
[00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:41.311]  Well, the answer is, folks, get in game, smuggle it in, do whatever you have to, and then make thousands of copies and give it to your whole neighborhood.
[00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:43.073]  Don't let them stop you.
[00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:45.836]  And let folks know, this is a suppressed video.
[00:14:46.836 --> 00:14:51.781]  I mean, use that against them, the fact that it is suppressed, that it is banned, that they don't want you to have it.
[00:14:52.561 --> 00:14:57.466]  You know, we still ship to Canada, but we lose money on it because most of the packages don't make it.
[00:14:57.486 --> 00:14:59.307]  I want listeners in Canada to know that.
[00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:02.050]  And we've done tests.
[00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:06.333]  We've mailed the films from other locations with another business name.
[00:15:06.413 --> 00:15:06.873]  No problem.
[00:15:06.893 --> 00:15:07.694]  They go straight through.
[00:15:08.134 --> 00:15:09.515]  Everything we do is flagged.
[00:15:10.135 --> 00:15:12.977]  And so, you know, we even have a subsidiary company.
[00:15:12.997 --> 00:15:15.159]  We'll change the name to that to try to get through.
[00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:19.522]  And then Canadians can't believe they're living in a country where it's so censored.
[00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:21.523]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kim in Texas.
[00:15:21.543 --> 00:15:22.724]  Kim, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[00:15:26.564 --> 00:15:28.766]  Kim, you must be listening to the radio.
[00:15:29.566 --> 00:15:30.307]  Oh, no, I'm here.
[00:15:30.407 --> 00:15:30.647]  I'm here.
[00:15:30.687 --> 00:15:31.148]  I'm sorry.
[00:15:32.028 --> 00:15:32.209]  Yes.
[00:15:32.249 --> 00:15:32.789]  Hi, Alex.
[00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:33.350]  Hi, Bob.
[00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.011]  Yes, I'm calling you.
[00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:35.711]  I'm from Houston.
[00:15:36.632 --> 00:15:38.273]  And I have a question.
[00:15:38.314 --> 00:15:39.535]  My husband's a truck driver.
[00:15:40.595 --> 00:15:44.038]  And we've been, you know, affected in a lot of ways.
[00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:48.402]  You know, we have our good months and then we have most of the time it's bad months.
[00:15:49.402 --> 00:15:53.105]  And I was just wondering, where do you see that industry heading?
[00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:56.929]  Right down the toilet.
[00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:06.677]  Yeah, about over 70% of what we use in America goes by trucks on the road.
[00:16:07.558 --> 00:16:16.025]  And as the economy slows down, you know, less trucking will need to be used to transport goods.
[00:16:17.066 --> 00:16:23.011]  And so I see it in a recession and eventually, like the remainder of the economy,
[00:16:23.596 --> 00:16:25.158]  And on top of that, they sold
[00:16:38.496 --> 00:16:43.300]  The truck driving industry first on putting transponders in, companies tracking their trucks.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:55.972]  Now a lot of states are trying to pressure companies and the feds to put that in as part of trusted trader, trusted traveler, especially if you go to these international commerce points that they've built, these inland ports and others.
[00:16:56.592 --> 00:17:01.216]  Now what's happening is the state police are getting federal databases.
[00:17:02.097 --> 00:17:06.079]  I agree with that and that's a part of what I call the corporatist fascist state.
[00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:06.940]  The concentration of industry
[00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:32.699]  This is the control.
[00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.561]  You see, Walmart is the sharecropper company store.
[00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:39.022]  And that's why, as the economy goes down, they become more wealthy.
[00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:55.788]  Because again, they're not competing fairly.
[00:17:55.828 --> 00:18:01.429]  They have slave labor and slave goods and Chinese currencies devalued so no one can compete.
[00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:06.591]  They have strategic deals with the infrastructure there so no one can compete with it.
[00:18:07.011 --> 00:18:09.732]  And so that's why their profits are way up and everything else is in the toilet.
[00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:12.613]  Then everything else goes bankrupt and all you have left is Walmart.
[00:18:12.893 --> 00:18:14.614]  That's why they're part of the national security
[00:18:15.474 --> 00:18:16.055]  It's terrible.
[00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:50.955]  And it just goes on and on, and we're here to report it, and you people, you've got to know about it, and you've got to get those videos, and you've got to get them out to everybody, so everybody will understand what they're up against.
[00:18:51.335 --> 00:18:51.955]  Absolutely.
[00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:54.656]  Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:56.417]  I want to get you back up next week.
[00:18:56.497 --> 00:19:03.039]  Every week that we're able to have you on and able to stay on the radio is a real blessing from God, and I hope folks will visit your site.
[00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.800]  We've got it up on PrisonPlanet.tv screen right now.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.560]  Take care, my friend.
[00:19:07.461 --> 00:19:07.861]  Thank you.
[00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:08.261]  Bye-bye.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:28.754]  Folks, when we tell you, and it's been in the mainstream news, that my websites, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, are censored by government systems, especially overseas, when we tell you that our videos are being censored, when we tell you people are being arrested for passing out my videos in the United States, and give you the news articles where it's in the mainstream press,
[00:19:29.434 --> 00:19:31.155]  With the news reporting like it's no big deal.
[00:19:32.517 --> 00:19:33.297]  It's already here.
[00:19:33.417 --> 00:19:34.258]  I'm just a big fish.
[00:19:34.278 --> 00:19:37.100]  They're afraid to come after me right now because they don't want to startle people.
[00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:38.301]  That's down the road.
[00:19:38.742 --> 00:19:42.165]  This is classical, hardcore, ultra-tyranny.
[00:19:42.365 --> 00:19:50.191]  This is foreign banks hijacking the U.S., looting everything, and they plan to use paramilitary, brainwashed police and military to enforce this.
[00:19:50.532 --> 00:19:51.913]  We have to stand up against it.
[00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:53.494]  We have to ring the alarm bell.
[00:19:53.694 --> 00:19:55.496]  We have to fight this tyranny and have courage.
[00:19:57.469 --> 00:19:59.429]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:19:59.709 --> 00:20:02.330]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:10.952]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:20:11.232 --> 00:20:14.072]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:18.113]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:20:19.454 --> 00:20:21.034]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:20:21.434 --> 00:20:22.354]  Take action now!
[00:20:22.474 --> 00:20:26.116]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:20:27.296 --> 00:20:31.057]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:20:31.278 --> 00:20:34.479]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:41.021]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:46.625]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:20:47.305 --> 00:20:49.407]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:20:49.627 --> 00:20:54.851]  Call me, John Humer, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:20:55.231 --> 00:21:03.116]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:03.477 --> 00:21:05.158]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:06.112 --> 00:21:07.132]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:07.653 --> 00:21:08.153]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:08.453 --> 00:21:09.433]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:09.453 --> 00:21:10.774]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:10.834 --> 00:21:12.454]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:19.577]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:19.957 --> 00:21:20.397]  Some U.S.
[00:21:20.437 --> 00:21:26.099]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:30.281]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:30.301 --> 00:21:33.102]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:56.639 --> 00:21:59.802]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:22:00.162 --> 00:22:01.904]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:22:02.084 --> 00:22:07.428]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:22:07.648 --> 00:22:15.375]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[00:22:25.263 --> 00:22:28.287]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.

[00:22:48.091 --> 00:22:49.413]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[00:22:56.574 --> 00:23:00.215]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:05.917]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:10.078]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:23:10.358 --> 00:23:12.638]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:23:12.818 --> 00:23:18.720]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.301]  I don't know.
[00:23:35.998 --> 00:23:37.098]  I was a highway man
[00:24:04.122 --> 00:24:09.704]  I'm just glad that in my little life, the dark side didn't win.
[00:24:09.724 --> 00:24:11.565]  It tried to get me, but I escaped it.
[00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:13.865]  And I'm glad that I'm on the side of good.
[00:24:13.905 --> 00:24:19.567]  I thank God every day that I don't live under the New World Order's deception.
[00:24:33.217 --> 00:24:37.020]  That I've been given great discernment that intensifies every hour.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:46.105]  And I thank God every minute that I have this great sense of mission.
[00:24:46.866 --> 00:24:48.567]  And I know I'm in the right place in my life.
[00:24:49.027 --> 00:24:55.312]  And so I don't fear the great pain that's coming.
[00:24:57.273 --> 00:24:58.354]  I don't fear for my body.
[00:25:01.155 --> 00:25:01.796]  Because I know
[00:25:04.465 --> 00:25:06.186]  That my soul is in the right place.
[00:25:08.386 --> 00:25:10.707]  And is saved forever.
[00:25:13.488 --> 00:25:16.429]  This life is a test.
[00:25:16.889 --> 00:25:19.329]  And before I hated the wicked.
[00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:25.231]  Now I pity them.
[00:25:26.011 --> 00:25:27.732]  Because I realize they're deceived.
[00:25:27.752 --> 00:25:32.593]  And the vast majority of these vampires know not what they do.
[00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:39.269]  But that doesn't mean I don't fight them.
[00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.830]  I fight them that much harder.
[00:25:43.571 --> 00:25:45.452]  But I fight them with a clear mind.
[00:25:48.134 --> 00:25:52.696]  So again, thank you for joining us today on PrisonPlanet.tv as we simulcast the radio show.
[00:25:53.917 --> 00:26:02.402]  I'll continue with your phone calls later in the hour, but right now, I want to get into victim disarmament.
[00:26:03.723 --> 00:26:05.684]  The enslavement of the people.
[00:26:07.076 --> 00:26:14.622]  The final linchpin in the physical and financial domination of the United States in the Western world.
[00:26:15.663 --> 00:26:23.690]  The final piece of the equation that the enemy has failed miserably in accomplishing.
[00:26:25.592 --> 00:26:29.135]  But they are continuing with their operation despite that.
[00:26:30.816 --> 00:26:34.860]  You know, I have seven different clips and
[00:26:37.423 --> 00:26:46.911]  We have these directly from the newscast, but I want to play clips of them from YouTube so that you know where you can go find them according to their title.
[00:26:49.153 --> 00:26:52.096]  The establishment counts on the public being ignorant.
[00:26:52.156 --> 00:26:55.278]  They count on the public not knowing the facts so they can be deceived.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.243]  The media says it's a wild rumor that Obama wants your guns.
[00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:07.831]  When he has the worst voting record in the Illinois State Senate and in the Federal Senate.
[00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:14.676]  And boy, that is quite a record with Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.
[00:27:16.077 --> 00:27:22.302]  He has lobbied for the DC gun ban, total gun ban, for the Chicago gun ban.
[00:27:23.854 --> 00:27:34.497]  He didn't just lobby, he helped write legislation to do it that is public, even the handwritten legislation that was then put into legislation is public, and it's in these clips that we have.
[00:27:35.558 --> 00:27:39.119]  But the first clip I want to play is Joe Biden.
[00:27:39.699 --> 00:27:49.222]  First, it's Governor Richards being asked, and it's a YouTube reporter for CNN during the debates months ago, the Democratic vice presidential debates, and they are
[00:27:51.801 --> 00:27:56.724]  Showing a citizen saying, well, here's my baby, here's my AR-15, you're not going to try to take it, are you?
[00:27:57.544 --> 00:28:04.048]  And when they cut to Biden, he goes, you're crazy, you're nuts, you're mentally ill, you don't deserve to have a gun.
[00:28:04.068 --> 00:28:09.130]  See, it's mentally ill for Biden, for a citizen, to have a semi-automatic rifle with a scary stock.
[00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:17.655]  But the SWAT teams, the police, the military on the streets, where we really should be afraid of guns, in the hands of government historically, that's a good thing.
[00:28:18.776 --> 00:28:20.957]  So we'll play this clip, come back and comment on it, here it is.
[00:28:27.512 --> 00:28:28.333]  Good evening, America.
[00:28:28.853 --> 00:28:30.775]  My name is Jared Townsend from Clio, Michigan.
[00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:39.762]  To all the candidates, tell me your position on gun control, as myself and other Americans really want to know if our babies are safe.
[00:28:42.464 --> 00:28:46.007]  This is my baby, purchased under the 1994 gun ban.
[00:28:46.788 --> 00:28:47.808]  Please tell me your views.
[00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:49.590]  Thank you.
[00:28:51.377 --> 00:28:53.570]  Governor Richardson, you have one of the highest NRA ratings.
[00:28:55.814 --> 00:28:59.955]  The issue here, I believe, is instant background checks.
[00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:06.257]  Nobody who has a criminal background or is mentally ill should be able to get a weapon.
[00:29:06.477 --> 00:29:07.277]  That is the key.
[00:29:07.557 --> 00:29:09.138]  And that includes gun sales.
[00:29:09.518 --> 00:29:10.738]  That includes gun sales.
[00:29:10.758 --> 00:29:11.619]  Alright, stop right there.
[00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:12.979]  Stop right there.
[00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:14.380]  We got a break.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.740]  We're going to come back and go to Biden.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.741]  Now see, Richardson sounds more reasonable there, but he's not.
[00:29:19.101 --> 00:29:22.462]  It's that instant registration for confiscation they've done in every country.
[00:29:24.025 --> 00:29:31.471]  Now, when we come back, we're going to go to Biden, who just is shocked and amazed by a slave off the plantation.
[00:29:31.891 --> 00:29:36.094]  He's like somebody in the 1860s who would see a Native American with a rifle.
[00:29:36.134 --> 00:29:37.015]  That would have been scary.
[00:29:37.355 --> 00:29:38.076]  A slave?
[00:29:38.136 --> 00:29:39.397]  Somebody I want to exterminate?
[00:29:39.657 --> 00:29:40.257]  With a gun?
[00:29:40.498 --> 00:29:42.519]  You know, get that gun out of that engine's hand.
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.161]  You know, get that gun out of that black man's hand.
[00:29:45.521 --> 00:29:46.162]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.063 --> 00:29:47.963]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.464 --> 00:29:49.965]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:50.974 --> 00:29:53.661]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:56.877 --> 00:30:01.459]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:08.982]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:30:09.242 --> 00:30:10.643]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:30:10.843 --> 00:30:14.744]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:30:15.005 --> 00:30:18.586]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:30:18.826 --> 00:30:22.888]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:30:23.308 --> 00:30:27.319]  Phase 1 is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.305]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.161]  On September 11, 2001, along with
[00:31:00.376 --> 00:31:02.638]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:31:02.899 --> 00:31:04.200]  And we knew what to do.
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.002]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:31:06.222 --> 00:31:12.648]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:31:13.249 --> 00:31:21.777]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:31:22.165 --> 00:31:28.949]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:31:29.249 --> 00:31:32.311]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:31:32.431 --> 00:31:37.614]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:31:38.194 --> 00:31:40.836]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:31:41.276 --> 00:31:48.060]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[00:31:51.331 --> 00:31:52.051]  We're good to go.
[00:32:18.443 --> 00:32:24.465]  Our fuel additive reduces the emissions and maintenance costs and reduces the friction of engine moving parts.
[00:32:24.785 --> 00:32:30.926]  Our two ounce consumer squeeze bottle costs only $8 and treats 100 gallons of gasoline or 50 gallons of diesel.

[00:32:50.992 --> 00:32:51.953]  I hurt myself today
[00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.472]  You know, when you don't care about others, you blind yourself.
[00:33:29.893 --> 00:33:39.257]  But when you do care about the universe around you, when you do realize you're connected to everything, the universe opens up to you.
[00:33:39.277 --> 00:33:40.678]  And that's what this broadcast is all about.
[00:33:40.698 --> 00:33:41.718]  It's about
[00:33:47.423 --> 00:33:49.164]  Truly living and being informed.
[00:33:50.766 --> 00:33:54.609]  You know, they say it's good when the military has weapons and uses them against people.
[00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:56.471]  Unarmed civilians.
[00:33:57.031 --> 00:33:59.733]  They say it's good when the police taser people when they die.
[00:34:00.134 --> 00:34:06.679]  They say it's good when they wear black masks and beat their batons on their armor to intimidate the public.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:13.665]  They say it's good when the police have been caught in Canada, in England, in Greece, in Australia.
[00:34:15.091 --> 00:34:26.824]  In Denver this year, Denver Post headlined the police attacked their own police officers so they could show the news cameras protesters attacking police so they could attack the crowds.
[00:34:28.626 --> 00:34:38.270]  They just caught them in Greece, dressed up, bashing out windows, attacking cars, so they could show it on the news saying, look, the protesters are attacking people's cars, when the protesters were really attacking government buildings.
[00:34:38.611 --> 00:34:45.854]  To try to swing the rest of the public in behind the criminal government that's literally grabbing all the infrastructure and handing it over to foreign banks.
[00:34:46.794 --> 00:34:50.576]  Why would the police all over the world want to stage terror attacks?
[00:34:50.996 --> 00:34:53.918]  That's what these provocateur attacks are, to demonize the public.
[00:34:54.218 --> 00:34:56.439]  Don't those officers know they're destroying their society?
[00:34:57.315 --> 00:35:03.640]  Well, no, their argument is with military tactics, because the police have never militarized, just like the Army Field Manual states, it's been declassified.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.461]  We've got to stage terror attacks.
[00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:09.004]  We've got to break trash cans, break windows, attack cars.
[00:35:09.204 --> 00:35:12.467]  The next step is staging larger terror attacks.
[00:35:13.588 --> 00:35:14.889]  See, that's how the mindset begins.
[00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:16.851]  They'll knock out a window, why not blow up a building?
[00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:19.252]  To blame it on their political enemies.
[00:35:19.292 --> 00:35:20.874]  We've got to fight dirty to win this fight.
[00:35:22.847 --> 00:35:31.233]  Now, I say all that in the context of, oh, we're safe when the police have machine guns, but we're not safe when the citizens have firearms.
[00:35:32.374 --> 00:35:35.357]  And then they try to spin it and say, well, we don't want people with fully auto.
[00:35:36.678 --> 00:35:39.440]  Well, number one is somebody who's pretty good with a rifle and a handgun.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.681]  Let me just tell you, you don't want semi-auto.
[00:35:42.182 --> 00:35:52.210]  I mean, you don't want full auto, unless you were in a machine gun nest with hundreds of troops charging you, and you have a larger, heavy machine gun.
[00:35:52.987 --> 00:35:53.828]  That's what that's for.
[00:35:56.809 --> 00:36:06.495]  What troops use in real combat generally, especially if they're trained properly, is the single tap or three round burst.
[00:36:08.657 --> 00:36:16.782]  And I've found with a three round burst that it's not even as accurate as single fire.
[00:36:18.223 --> 00:36:21.870]  I mean, you can drive tacks with single fire with a three-round burst.
[00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:29.965]  Your first round's going to be good, but there's going to be some pull on the rifle, even if you're a master marksman with a three-burst.
[00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:50.980]  Back in the day when I was a real gun aficionado, you know, I've talked about how we'd go to these big gun training seminars, mainly police items, so I had a chance to, you know, shoot quite a few fully automatics, and also shooting with others that have the special tax tag for fully auto, and I just don't like fully auto.
[00:36:52.121 --> 00:37:02.427]  But the point is, the media knows the public's ignorant, so they use that, and then they claim, oh, look at all these thousands of different types of, you know, rifles worldwide made, let's ban them because they look like a fully auto.
[00:37:03.288 --> 00:37:05.428]  So this guy shows his semi-auto 223.
[00:37:06.849 --> 00:37:07.789]  It's got a scope on it.
[00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:09.009]  How scary a slave.
[00:37:09.469 --> 00:37:12.710]  The first gun laws were against black Americans in this country.
[00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:18.731]  You know, we can't have blacks being armed because they need to be able to lynch them and abuse them and take their property and keep them in their place.
[00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:21.352]  Slaves in Rome couldn't be armed.
[00:37:22.432 --> 00:37:24.592]  It all boils down to Nazi Germany.
[00:37:25.072 --> 00:37:26.293]  The citizenry couldn't be armed.
[00:37:26.873 --> 00:37:29.653]  Tyranny always disarms the population.
[00:37:30.053 --> 00:37:32.714]  Tyrants always disarm the population.
[00:37:33.663 --> 00:37:35.564]  And they claim it's for the children and your safety.
[00:37:35.884 --> 00:37:37.945]  They know where they have gun restrictions.
[00:37:37.965 --> 00:37:38.925]  They have higher crime rates.
[00:37:39.366 --> 00:37:41.166]  They know more guns, less crime.
[00:37:41.346 --> 00:37:44.648]  They know people being armed is what this country was founded about.
[00:37:44.968 --> 00:37:50.991]  The Revolutionary War started in 1775 because of gun confiscation.
[00:37:53.325 --> 00:37:54.526]  And now the public's on to him.
[00:37:54.706 --> 00:38:00.971]  Now you see major polls, whereas about half the public was for gun control a decade ago, now 70 plus percent are against it.
[00:38:01.492 --> 00:38:05.335]  So they know they're losing the fight, so they're trying to come in and brainwash the public.
[00:38:05.355 --> 00:38:16.324]  Now, look at how scared Joseph Biden is, and how he's taken back and freaked out by a slave with a rifle, and he says the guy's mentally ill, and
[00:38:18.536 --> 00:38:20.161]  He's a CNN correspondent for YouTube.
[00:38:20.502 --> 00:38:23.692]  The guy's mentally ill and that he needs to have his gun confiscated.
[00:38:25.217 --> 00:38:25.538]  Here it is.
[00:38:26.988 --> 00:38:31.049]  Senator Biden, are you going to be able to keep his baby safe?
[00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:33.810]  I tell you what, if that's his baby, he needs help.
[00:39:00.831 --> 00:39:03.972]  I think he just made an admission against self-interest.
[00:39:04.072 --> 00:39:07.313]  I don't know that he's mentally qualified to own that gun.
[00:39:07.953 --> 00:39:09.233]  I'm being serious.
[00:39:09.273 --> 00:39:24.357]  Look, this idea we go around talking about people who own... I'm the guy that originally wrote the assault weapons ban that became law and then we got defeated and Barbara, excuse me, then Dianne Feinstein went to town on it and did a great job.
[00:39:24.717 --> 00:39:29.618]  Look, we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against
[00:39:30.376 --> 00:39:39.021]  People who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because they're either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record.
[00:39:41.003 --> 00:39:41.703]  Look at this guy.
[00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:42.604]  Look at this guy.
[00:39:43.624 --> 00:39:44.125]  Back it up.
[00:39:44.205 --> 00:39:47.427]  I mean look at how threatened he is.
[00:39:49.775 --> 00:39:51.396]  I mean, he is so upset.
[00:39:51.917 --> 00:39:57.482]  And the White House has these questionnaires now for anybody working anywhere in the executive branch, even out to the White House.
[00:39:57.842 --> 00:39:59.083]  Do you own a firearm?
[00:39:59.103 --> 00:40:00.104]  Do you believe the Second Amendment?
[00:40:00.484 --> 00:40:02.105]  And if they say yes, they're not being hired.
[00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:04.928]  It's okay to have the Secret Service guarding them with guns.
[00:40:05.288 --> 00:40:07.110]  It's okay for Biden to want to use the U.S.
[00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:12.534]  Army on the streets of America, and the Army openly admits that they're going to be waging war on the American people.
[00:40:12.714 --> 00:40:14.416]  They say, we're preparing to engage the public.
[00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:26.052]  See, they trained you to accept this police statement in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, and then now they're baiting and switching going, there's blonde-haired blue Al-Qaeda everywhere, there's gun owners, there's militias, we've got to take their guns.
[00:40:26.432 --> 00:40:30.775]  And then we have Barack Obama's real gun record.
[00:40:31.515 --> 00:40:32.856]  And we're going to go over some of that now.
[00:40:33.256 --> 00:40:36.238]  Let's analyze a little clip of this ABC news piece.
[00:40:38.567 --> 00:40:41.187]  Dealing with the record gun sales.
[00:40:41.368 --> 00:40:42.928]  And this is a month old.
[00:40:43.568 --> 00:40:45.808]  The gun sales are only accelerating now.
[00:40:46.328 --> 00:40:51.329]  And Obama's now coming out and saying, well, I'm for the Second Amendment under Chicago and D.C.
[00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:52.690]  laws, which means total ban.
[00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:56.890]  He says, we have a right to reasonably restrict them, which means totally ban them.
[00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:00.071]  Because this is a criminal.
[00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:01.551]  This is a thug.
[00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:04.892]  He works for the elite, and his job is to disarm the slaves.
[00:41:05.814 --> 00:41:08.415]  Just like blacks couldn't own guns 150 years ago in this nation.
[00:41:08.755 --> 00:41:09.436]  First gun laws.
[00:41:09.776 --> 00:41:10.776]  Just like Native Americans.
[00:41:11.437 --> 00:41:19.901]  I mean, if Senator Biden was some army general out in South Dakota, riding down and killing Native Americans, you know, they'd get freaked out.
[00:41:19.941 --> 00:41:21.181]  We got engines with guns!
[00:41:21.421 --> 00:41:22.882]  We got free people with guns!
[00:41:22.922 --> 00:41:24.043]  They could defend themselves!
[00:41:24.743 --> 00:41:26.064]  They don't want to go to the reservations.
[00:41:26.084 --> 00:41:26.984]  They don't want to be disarmed.
[00:41:27.004 --> 00:41:28.045]  They don't want to be domesticated.
[00:41:28.225 --> 00:41:29.545]  They don't want to be given poison blankets.
[00:41:29.565 --> 00:41:30.826]  They don't want their inoculations.
[00:41:31.646 --> 00:41:32.727]  That's the modern system.
[00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:38.695]  So, oh my gosh, you know, a black with a gun, a Native American with a gun.
[00:41:38.956 --> 00:41:40.838]  It's the same thing, but we're all slaves now.
[00:41:41.859 --> 00:41:42.900]  So let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:41:53.482 --> 00:41:55.883]  Glenn Parshall runs a gun store in Las Vegas.
[00:41:56.263 --> 00:41:58.665]  He says his customers aren't willing... Head pause.
[00:41:59.085 --> 00:42:00.145]  See, and that's what it is.
[00:42:00.986 --> 00:42:03.247]  I've had these cowardly gun dealers for years.
[00:42:03.407 --> 00:42:09.390]  When I walk in an Austin gun shop, no matter what gun shop it is, they'll say, Alex, I'm tired of you on the radios.
[00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:14.493]  I heard you, number one, saying that Bush was for the assault weapons ban, when he wasn't.
[00:42:14.793 --> 00:42:18.655]  And then there's always one clerk who goes, no, Bob, he was for it.
[00:42:19.397 --> 00:42:20.697]  You know, because they're in denial.
[00:42:20.897 --> 00:42:25.378]  And the next they'll say, well, I hear you say it's gun registration to fill out the NICS.
[00:42:25.418 --> 00:42:26.698]  That scares off customers.
[00:42:26.899 --> 00:42:29.259]  Then they go buy them from private sellers.
[00:42:29.979 --> 00:42:41.321]  And I'm like, well, if you got together as gun owners, instead of having the Judas Code NRA pose like they're your savior, but then always sell you out, you could get together as gun dealers and repeal these unconstitutional laws.
[00:42:42.522 --> 00:42:43.522]  It is a registration.
[00:42:44.122 --> 00:42:45.942]  They internally call the NICS system that.
[00:42:46.823 --> 00:42:48.203]  Now they want to put misdemeanors on it.
[00:42:49.202 --> 00:42:53.965]  And they know, long rifle, shotgun or handgun, they know what you've got, where you live, where you're at.
[00:42:53.985 --> 00:42:55.045]  It is an application.
[00:42:55.265 --> 00:42:56.526]  It's turning a right into a privilege.
[00:42:56.606 --> 00:43:01.268]  And I have people in Texas come up to me, who've lived there all their lives, and go, Alex, how do I get a gun?
[00:43:01.308 --> 00:43:02.629]  How do I get a license to own one?
[00:43:02.669 --> 00:43:07.071]  See, they give you a concealed carry, and then people think you have to have a license to have a gun, period.
[00:43:07.091 --> 00:43:08.092]  That's how it started in New York.
[00:43:08.612 --> 00:43:09.392]  There's no license.
[00:43:09.412 --> 00:43:12.014]  We need Vermont style, where they say it's the Second Amendment.
[00:43:12.514 --> 00:43:14.275]  But see, under Anglo-Saxon common law,
[00:43:15.427 --> 00:43:25.035]  Under common law in Texas and everywhere else, you can have a shotgun, you can walk around with a handgun on your side, but the police will violate common law and swarm you, taser you, attack you.
[00:43:25.756 --> 00:43:28.939]  People try to take their rifle out, put it in the back seat of their car to go deer hunting.
[00:43:29.259 --> 00:43:31.181]  Cops show up because the neighbor sees a gun.
[00:43:31.541 --> 00:43:35.665]  They're watching sitcoms, they're watching the news, they're being conditioned that guns are illegal when they're not.
[00:43:36.606 --> 00:43:38.788]  And police will even ask you in Texas, you got a permit for that?
[00:43:39.128 --> 00:43:40.209]  There is no permit!
[00:43:41.647 --> 00:43:45.808]  A permit is a license to do something that would be illegal.
[00:43:47.209 --> 00:43:47.929]  It's a permission.
[00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:55.731]  Now, under the common law, in states that still follow it, I can carry a rifle publicly, or a handgun.
[00:43:56.592 --> 00:43:57.052]  You understand?
[00:43:58.564 --> 00:43:59.686]  This is all lawyer tricks.
[00:44:00.347 --> 00:44:04.833]  But, under common law, you cannot carry concealed weapons.
[00:44:05.714 --> 00:44:10.381]  So, they come out with state laws to carry a concealed weapon.
[00:44:10.942 --> 00:44:14.146]  Under common law, you do need a license because that's illegal.
[00:44:14.767 --> 00:44:16.549]  You bear your arms openly as a freeman.
[00:44:16.969 --> 00:44:18.050]  That way it's an armed culture.
[00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:18.871]  Everybody accepts it.
[00:44:19.091 --> 00:44:21.673]  But see, first they make us treat it like it's pornography or something.
[00:44:21.693 --> 00:44:22.654]  We put it in a black bag.
[00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:23.394]  We hide it.
[00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:24.475]  We're ashamed of it.
[00:44:24.555 --> 00:44:26.537]  See, now the moral authority is against it.
[00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:32.001]  And they trick you into going and getting a concealed carry when it turns a right into a privilege.
[00:44:32.462 --> 00:44:35.625]  Instead of just demanding your right to carry a firearm.
[00:44:37.486 --> 00:44:39.027]  See how they play these legalese tricks?
[00:44:41.229 --> 00:44:41.970]  So, uh, but...
[00:44:43.226 --> 00:44:47.229]  Notice this guy also says, yeah, it's Obama people coming in and buying guns.
[00:44:47.969 --> 00:44:50.871]  I've talked to a lot of gun dealers saying that's happening even here in Texas.
[00:44:52.192 --> 00:44:53.113]  And this is happening.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:45:00.346]  Because they all got on the hype bandwagon and now they found out he really is for gun bans and so they're even panicking.
[00:45:00.626 --> 00:45:01.668]  See, that's all part of the hype.
[00:45:02.288 --> 00:45:02.789]  It didn't matter.
[00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:04.210]  McCain was anti-gun too.
[00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.271]  Don't think I'm for McCain here.
[00:45:05.291 --> 00:45:05.972]  They're both controlled.
[00:45:06.332 --> 00:45:07.974]  The point is, we're in trouble.
[00:45:08.234 --> 00:45:09.315]  Let's go back to the clip.
[00:45:10.016 --> 00:45:13.600]  ...to gamble their guns on Obama, even if they voted for him.
[00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:24.298]  One of the strangest things that I've had happen the past few weeks was I've had a lot of people coming in here wearing Obama buttons and Obama t-shirts in here to buy guns.
[00:45:24.598 --> 00:45:26.620]  They tell me they're in here to buy them before he bans them.
[00:45:27.401 --> 00:45:28.442]  What's that telling you about it?
[00:45:28.943 --> 00:45:35.069]  The run on guns comes despite the president-elect's assurances he will protect the right to bear arms.
[00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:38.192]  The NRA has a different position.
[00:45:40.965 --> 00:45:42.266]  Notice he says the NRA.
[00:45:42.286 --> 00:45:43.506]  It's never about the Second Amendment.
[00:45:43.526 --> 00:45:44.507]  It's never about the people.
[00:45:44.947 --> 00:45:48.489]  You know, every time they're having warrantless wiretaps, they say the ACLU doesn't like it.
[00:45:48.749 --> 00:45:52.611]  And that's a politicized organization that a lot of people don't like for other stances.
[00:45:52.631 --> 00:45:54.912]  See, they're minimizing you down to a subgroup.
[00:45:55.392 --> 00:45:55.992]  The NRA.
[00:45:56.012 --> 00:45:59.554]  The NRA was founded after the Feds won the Civil War.
[00:46:00.868 --> 00:46:04.950]  to arm paramilitary groups in the north to come in and carpetbag in the south.
[00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:05.491]  That's a fact.
[00:46:05.811 --> 00:46:09.813]  The NRA was founded as a gun control group.
[00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:10.614]  I've had Larry Pratt on it.
[00:46:10.674 --> 00:46:11.354]  Read those documents.
[00:46:11.874 --> 00:46:14.676]  They're the ones that got the Gun Control Act passed in 33.
[00:46:14.716 --> 00:46:18.718]  They are the ones that lobbied for the 68 Gun Control Act.
[00:46:18.998 --> 00:46:23.161]  You walk in one of these ignorant gun shop places and you tell them that, get out of here!
[00:46:23.241 --> 00:46:24.561]  Comeeee!
[00:46:24.922 --> 00:46:30.025]  Hey, you think they could have got our guns and passed any gun control laws if the globalists didn't control
[00:46:30.945 --> 00:46:33.606]  Our major group, the NRA is controlled.
[00:46:33.626 --> 00:46:34.787]  Does that mean their whole board is controlled?
[00:46:34.807 --> 00:46:34.927]  No.
[00:46:35.127 --> 00:46:37.508]  They get a good board member occasionally and they'll always run them out.
[00:46:39.449 --> 00:46:39.969]  You understand?
[00:46:41.369 --> 00:46:41.790]  You understand?
[00:46:46.417 --> 00:46:51.581]  Now, we've got clip after clip of Obama saying, well, if it's reasonable.
[00:46:52.041 --> 00:46:54.503]  But again, he calls reasonable total gun ban.
[00:46:54.803 --> 00:46:57.765]  Let's go back to the just tyrant.
[00:46:57.805 --> 00:46:59.346]  I mean, he wants to disarm you.
[00:47:00.087 --> 00:47:04.009]  100% of the time in history, that means they want to abuse you and dominate you and slave you.
[00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:05.711]  I mean, they know why they're doing it.
[00:47:06.371 --> 00:47:08.072]  Nothing to do with the little kiddies and keeping them safe.
[00:47:08.092 --> 00:47:09.393]  Here it is.
[00:47:09.573 --> 00:47:13.156]  If we allow even the smallest concession that somehow
[00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:16.310]  Guns are going to be taken away from everybody.
[00:47:17.771 --> 00:47:22.112]  If you subscribe to that view, then you're not going to agree with me.
[00:47:22.892 --> 00:47:37.795]  If, on the other hand, you're a gun owner here in South Dakota who uses your gun to hunt or to protect your family, and does so in a lawful way, then you have nothing to worry about from me.
[00:47:39.178 --> 00:47:42.561]  But many gun owners remember something Obama said before.
[00:47:57.472 --> 00:48:01.596]  They get this real calm, soothing, I mean this guy's programming.
[00:48:02.057 --> 00:48:16.131]  Everything's alright, but if you're reasonable, if you're a South Dakotan, he's talking to that group of people like, if you're part of this tribe, if you're a reasonable South Dakotan, whatever group he's talking to, like you, because you're a South Dakotan, you're special.
[00:48:19.491 --> 00:48:24.534]  He's hitting neuro-linguistic programming, he's using tribal programs, local programming.
[00:48:26.675 --> 00:48:28.697]  It's all multi-faceted, very deceptive.
[00:48:29.077 --> 00:48:36.502]  Then we have all these clips of him going, well if you think we should just take all the guns at once, unilaterally, that may not be constitutional, but we're going to take a lot of them.
[00:48:36.782 --> 00:48:38.083]  I've got that clip.
[00:48:38.483 --> 00:48:43.386]  This guy passed bills and tried to pass bills to take all your guns.
[00:48:43.647 --> 00:48:44.847]  He did that when he was in Illinois.
[00:48:45.228 --> 00:48:46.769]  He is a piece of filth.
[00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:47.189]  Here it is.
[00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:51.012]  And, uh, does so in a lawful way.
[00:48:51.673 --> 00:48:52.973]  Then you have nothing to worry about for me.
[00:48:53.374 --> 00:48:53.774]  Yes!
[00:48:54.334 --> 00:48:58.056]  But many gun owners remember something Obama said before that.
[00:48:59.016 --> 00:49:01.738]  People have been beaten down for so long.
[00:49:01.758 --> 00:49:05.940]  And they feel so betrayed by government.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.543]  Well, it's not surprising then that they get things they claim to guns or religion.
[00:49:12.483 --> 00:49:17.226]  The National Rifle Association has done its best to scare gun owners about Obama.
[00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:18.046]  Alright, stop right there!
[00:49:18.976 --> 00:49:19.536]  Stop right there.
[00:49:20.097 --> 00:49:21.638]  They've done their best to scare?
[00:49:22.178 --> 00:49:31.144]  Yeah, so they can look like they're the group you can trust, so they can get your millions of dollars a year in contributions, and then go Judas Goat and sell you out.
[00:49:33.606 --> 00:49:39.330]  I mean, this ABC News piece isn't showing you all the bills he actually authored, word for word, with bill numbers.
[00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:40.510]  We're going to show that to you coming up.
[00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:41.091]  Here it is.
[00:49:42.398 --> 00:49:45.827]  What Barack Obama called America's 80 million gun owners.
[00:49:46.007 --> 00:49:47.531]  Don't tell me words don't matter!
[00:49:47.791 --> 00:49:50.338]  Gun owners have their own word for Barack Obama.
[00:49:51.218 --> 00:49:56.001]  Obama voted four times to deny citizens the right of self-protection, even in their home.
[00:49:56.682 --> 00:49:58.763]  Look at his voting record.
[00:49:59.123 --> 00:49:59.864]  Not his words.
[00:49:59.884 --> 00:50:00.684]  Don't listen to his words.
[00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:01.805]  Look at his actions.
[00:50:01.925 --> 00:50:03.806]  Look at his voting record.
[00:50:04.247 --> 00:50:06.288]  And if he had the ability, he'd take everything away.
[00:50:06.448 --> 00:50:07.069]  I guarantee it.
[00:50:07.209 --> 00:50:08.509]  I promise you, man, I'm not going to shout out of a doubt.
[00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:09.310]  If he had the ability.
[00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.892]  The only reason he doesn't is because people stand up to him and stop him to some degree.
[00:50:13.153 --> 00:50:17.736]  But he's going to have, with a democratic, you know, Congress and everything, he's going to be able to push through whatever he wants to now.
[00:50:18.576 --> 00:50:19.916]  He says he doesn't want to take them away.
[00:50:19.936 --> 00:50:20.657]  You're lying through his teeth.
[00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:22.938]  Look at his voting record.
[00:50:23.158 --> 00:50:25.278]  Don't listen to his words, look at his actions.
[00:50:25.318 --> 00:50:27.099]  That's all I have to say about that.
[00:50:27.319 --> 00:50:32.141]  Barack Obama doesn't believe that the citizens have the right to own a handgun, period.
[00:50:32.741 --> 00:50:36.422]  He wants them only for law enforcement and for the military.
[00:50:36.822 --> 00:50:37.142]  That's right.
[00:50:37.162 --> 00:50:40.463]  And that just makes... We're going to come back, folks, with his real record.
[00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:44.865]  Now, again, but they're telling you, oh, we don't want your guns, but we do want to ban them.
[00:50:45.816 --> 00:50:47.876]  I mean, he is for total gun ban.
[00:50:48.496 --> 00:50:50.737]  He has supported and voted and pushed for that.
[00:50:51.077 --> 00:50:52.377]  We're going to come back with the facts.
[00:50:52.677 --> 00:50:53.177]  Stay with us.
[00:50:56.338 --> 00:51:05.439]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:51:05.599 --> 00:51:13.621]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:51:14.121 --> 00:51:18.282]  First, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:51:18.362 --> 00:51:20.983]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:51:21.123 --> 00:51:32.427]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[00:51:53.333 --> 00:52:02.895]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:03.255 --> 00:52:04.976]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:05.908 --> 00:52:06.929]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:07.449 --> 00:52:07.949]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:08.229 --> 00:52:09.230]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.591]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:10.611 --> 00:52:12.232]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.592 --> 00:52:19.356]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:19.756 --> 00:52:20.196]  Some U.S.
[00:52:20.236 --> 00:52:25.900]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:30.063]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:30.083 --> 00:52:32.225]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:57.066 --> 00:53:08.769]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:11.634]  I think so.
[00:53:36.954 --> 00:53:37.294]  Federal agents!
[00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:37.694]  We are armed!
[00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:38.835]  The United Nations on July 7th
[00:54:08.622 --> 00:54:18.067]  2001 had a UNIDIR United Nations Small Arms Disarmament Summit in New York City.
[00:54:18.867 --> 00:54:21.848]  And many times I read off the official UN website their agenda.
[00:54:22.769 --> 00:54:31.353]  And they stated that civilian ownership of firearms threatens, in their words, the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:54:32.961 --> 00:54:34.361]  Power monopoly of the state.
[00:54:34.902 --> 00:54:44.585]  Only the government, which is illegitimate and doesn't do what the people want or what's constitutional, that only exists for foreign banks to use it as a suction proboscis to suck our economy dry.
[00:54:46.165 --> 00:54:48.906]  That's why tyrannical governments want your guns, want your weapons.
[00:54:49.306 --> 00:54:51.007]  For thousands of years it's always the same.
[00:54:51.667 --> 00:54:53.847]  Because it threatens their power monopoly.
[00:54:54.368 --> 00:54:56.108]  Their power monopoly.
[00:54:56.488 --> 00:54:58.129]  They want a power monopoly.
[00:54:58.149 --> 00:55:00.409]  They don't want you to have a check and balance against them.
[00:55:00.449 --> 00:55:01.810]  And now, openly,
[00:55:02.901 --> 00:55:04.542]  I've had multiple Congressmen on.
[00:55:05.023 --> 00:55:06.804]  Senator Inhofe, we've played the audio.
[00:55:07.805 --> 00:55:09.266]  They were threatened with martial law.
[00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.306]  They didn't pass the bailout.
[00:55:10.346 --> 00:55:13.849]  The bailout was a total martial law for Wall Street.
[00:55:13.889 --> 00:55:16.691]  Wall Street took over the government, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:17.171 --> 00:55:18.512]  Congress has no authority now.
[00:55:19.433 --> 00:55:21.094]  Over eight and a half trillion have been stolen.
[00:55:21.935 --> 00:55:23.796]  And we haven't even gotten the new numbers in three weeks.
[00:55:23.856 --> 00:55:24.837]  I'm sure it's far worse now.
[00:55:26.877 --> 00:55:28.779]  So, here is Obama's real record.
[00:55:28.799 --> 00:55:36.385]  This is a TV ad that ran during the election, and you can go pull up all these bill numbers, all of it, and this is 110% accurate.
[00:55:37.025 --> 00:55:38.847]  In fact, it's far worse than even this.
[00:55:39.387 --> 00:55:39.687]  Okay?
[00:55:40.068 --> 00:55:42.470]  And Bush didn't triple the size of the BATF for nothing.
[00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:44.331]  This has all been planned, all staged.
[00:55:44.691 --> 00:55:45.952]  Let's go ahead and go to that next clip.
[00:55:45.972 --> 00:55:46.293]  Here it is.
[00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:52.956]  The right to bear arms is one of the fundamental ideals on which our nation was founded.
[00:55:53.497 --> 00:56:00.664]  Hard-working, law-abiding Americans have for generations enjoyed this freedom in their communities and with their families.
[00:56:01.565 --> 00:56:07.871]  But Barack Obama believes that many Americans simply cling to guns in times of economic distress.
[00:56:08.772 --> 00:56:19.337]  Speaking behind closed doors to an audience of San Francisco donors, Barack Obama said they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations.
[00:56:20.038 --> 00:56:22.259]  Obama's anti-gun record is long.
[00:56:23.019 --> 00:56:32.984]  In 2004, he voted against legislation drafted to protect homeowners from prosecution in cases where they used a firearm to halt a home invasion.
[00:56:33.864 --> 00:56:45.529]  In 2003, he voted in support of legislation that would have effectively banned most of the privately held hunting shotguns, target rifles, and black powder rifles in Illinois.
[00:56:46.229 --> 00:56:52.752]  And in 1996, Obama supported a ban on the manufacture, sale, and possession of handguns.
[00:56:53.332 --> 00:57:00.775]  But now, Obama's running for president and claims no knowledge of this, even though his handwriting is all over it.
[00:57:01.375 --> 00:57:04.820]  Barack Obama, out of touch with American values.
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:05.301]  Alright.
[00:57:05.821 --> 00:57:07.464]  Not ready to lead.
[00:57:08.044 --> 00:57:09.606]  Look, he's not out of touch.
[00:57:09.667 --> 00:57:11.389]  He knows he's got a job to disarm the people.
[00:57:11.789 --> 00:57:13.331]  And no matter what administration it is.
[00:57:15.003 --> 00:57:17.745]  They are going to continue to push gun control.
[00:57:17.785 --> 00:57:19.847]  They're going to continue to try to disarm the people.
[00:57:20.207 --> 00:57:21.308]  It's not gun control.
[00:57:21.328 --> 00:57:23.310]  See, that's Orwellian gun control.
[00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:24.851]  You want to control your gun, don't you?
[00:57:25.291 --> 00:57:26.332]  Like, guns are out of control.
[00:57:26.612 --> 00:57:29.135]  No, it's criminals and criminal government out of control.
[00:57:29.775 --> 00:57:32.978]  And this is how the 1775-1776 war started.
[00:57:33.238 --> 00:57:39.323]  We're going to end this hour, come back, finish up with the gun control, and we've got another guest coming up who's fighting attacks on free speech.
[00:57:39.963 --> 00:57:41.405]  They're also attacking the First Amendment.
[00:57:42.165 --> 00:57:43.766]  Both parties controlled by foreign interest.
[00:57:44.166 --> 00:57:54.550]  But I do want to encourage everybody out there listening on the AM and FM dial shortwave internet satellite on the streams at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:57:54.570 --> 00:58:00.552]  And we put a lot into this TV studio, a lot into these two-hour live feeds we do, simulcasting the radio show.
[00:58:01.252 --> 00:58:10.216]  And I would encourage folks to go use your username and password if you are a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber for 15 cents a day to watch the show online right now, live.
[00:58:11.136 --> 00:58:15.380]  And also then we archive it each day in Flash and in Windows.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.562]  And it's really good in code, really high quality, high res.
[00:58:18.943 --> 00:58:23.546]  And we're going to up it even more in the near future there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:32.053]  And going into these hard economic times, more than ever, we need you to financially support us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:32.113 --> 00:58:34.816]  So we still have the deal going where you can get five plus months free.
[00:58:35.517 --> 00:58:38.565]  Right now at PrisonPlanet.tv when you subscribe.
[00:58:38.786 --> 00:58:40.210]  We'll be right back with the next hour.
[00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:40.831]  Please stay with us.
[00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:37.766]  ...America, freedom to fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[00:59:38.186 --> 00:59:40.447]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:59:40.827 --> 00:59:46.170]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:59:49.312 --> 00:59:51.233]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:51.713 --> 00:59:54.494]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.832]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:00:09.892 --> 01:00:11.714]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:11.754 --> 01:00:12.515]  I've been going over.
[01:00:12.535 --> 01:00:15.678]  Barack Obama, who supported the D.C.
[01:00:15.698 --> 01:00:21.183]  gun ban, supports the Chicago total victim disirement there in the crime capital of the United States.
[01:00:22.304 --> 01:00:24.165]  Absolutely outrageous!
[01:00:25.046 --> 01:00:27.328]  And then they have the nerve to deny what they're doing.
[01:00:27.888 --> 01:00:31.410]  They've been attacking importers, using regulations to shut them down, just as Bush did.
[01:00:31.851 --> 01:00:33.892]  They're raiding a record number of gun stores.
[01:00:34.693 --> 01:00:36.074]  They're going after gun shows.
[01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:40.817]  Obama, I have more clips here, is now saying he does want to shut down private sale of guns.
[01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:47.121]  That means if you want to sell a rifle to your cousin, your neighbor, your son, you get SWAT teamed, you go to prison.
[01:00:47.822 --> 01:00:51.985]  You go to the gun show to sell somebody a rifle or handgun, that's shut down.
[01:00:52.992 --> 01:00:59.119]  Then everything has to be a registered transfer, even if you give your grandson a .22 rifle when he's 10 years old.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.144]  They even want to start registering and making you do a background check for BB guns.
[01:01:04.685 --> 01:01:08.208]  Many cities are banning pellet guns and BB guns are restricting them.
[01:01:09.227 --> 01:01:10.689]  England's trying to do the same thing.
[01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:13.012]  And in England they prosecute you.
[01:01:13.032 --> 01:01:15.195]  In Canada they prosecute you if you defend yourself.
[01:01:15.496 --> 01:01:16.577]  Now we're seeing some U.S.
[01:01:16.617 --> 01:01:20.963]  cities prosecute people that try to defend themselves.
[01:01:21.003 --> 01:01:24.388]  I mean, this is just absolutely outrageous.
[01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:26.429]  That all of this is going on.
[01:01:26.889 --> 01:01:29.810]  Earlier in the week, we had Robert Wannick on.
[01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:35.851]  He's the 14-year-old high school student who's been, had police called on him for talking about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:01:36.632 --> 01:01:42.633]  They told him he's not allowed to tell people 9-11's an inside job, that there's no free speech, they have cameras in the school classrooms and the halls.
[01:01:43.093 --> 01:01:45.033]  Many schools have cameras now in the bathrooms.
[01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:46.254]  Same thing in England.
[01:01:46.574 --> 01:01:51.775]  This total grid where the schools literally are government re-education camps.
[01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:55.958]  Where they literally brainwash you and teach you about the New World Order.
[01:01:56.258 --> 01:02:00.582]  He's also, of course, his textbook they have in his high school that they use all over the country.
[01:02:01.342 --> 01:02:04.525]  One of the major publishers teaches them that world government's good, New World Order's good.
[01:02:04.905 --> 01:02:09.869]  And if he raises his hand and says, I don't want world government, they come to him and say, it doesn't say New World Order.
[01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:11.591]  It doesn't exist.
[01:02:11.631 --> 01:02:13.953]  Now, people go, that sounds crazy.
[01:02:14.413 --> 01:02:20.198]  If you study Soviet re-education camps, if you study Nazi re-education camps, if you study Pol Pot,
[01:02:21.149 --> 01:02:23.075]  They would do the same thing.
[01:02:23.235 --> 01:02:24.298]  They act crazy.
[01:02:24.358 --> 01:02:25.341]  They say you're nuts.
[01:02:25.622 --> 01:02:29.232]  They will say something, we need world government, and then say, but it doesn't exist.
[01:02:30.051 --> 01:02:34.375]  And this is part of just a mass mental illness of just confusing people.
[01:02:34.435 --> 01:02:36.136]  It's part of reprogramming.
[01:02:36.777 --> 01:02:43.582]  And it gets into sophisticated psychology and they just teach the teachers, who were just taught to do this in the principles, to just regurgitate it.
[01:02:43.722 --> 01:02:46.785]  They're just programmed themselves and don't realize what they're part of.
[01:02:47.065 --> 01:02:53.431]  Also, zero tolerance, where over-the-counter cough drops that have no type of drug in them.
[01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:57.954]  This girl that got in trouble and kicked out of school and the police are looking and arresting her in Florida.
[01:02:58.835 --> 01:03:01.797]  Last time I checked, there wasn't even menthol in the hauls.
[01:03:01.918 --> 01:03:02.838]  It was a honey hauls.
[01:03:03.599 --> 01:03:04.500]  In the candy section.
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.042]  She gave it to some friends, they said, you're a drug dealer.
[01:03:07.802 --> 01:03:09.844]  Again, sounds crazy, sounds ridiculous.
[01:03:10.384 --> 01:03:14.547]  Again, and they always proudly say, zero tolerance for our children's safety.
[01:03:14.848 --> 01:03:17.290]  It's about unreasonableness being honored.
[01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:23.775]  Unreasonableness, you know, setting the precedent to do ridiculous things so they can do more and more wild things.
[01:03:24.787 --> 01:03:31.030]  It's like the cases where they'll take somebody into the hospital after a car wreck and say, we're going to take, you know, we want a urine sample to see if you're on drugs.
[01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:32.210]  The person will say, I can't urinate.
[01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:36.753]  They'll walk a cop in, taser them over and over again until they answer the question.
[01:03:37.653 --> 01:03:41.055]  Or you'll have some robberies in Arkansas or Oklahoma or Kentucky.
[01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:48.278]  They'll just say, we have 24 hour a day curfews now, checkpoints, everyone, you're only allowed to go to work, we stop you and make sure you're only going to work.
[01:03:49.718 --> 01:04:04.782]  I mean, this is happening in America, and the Feds are the ones pushing it, and we warned you all these years that they were going to put troops on the streets, they were going to use them against the American people, and now they are actually announcing it and doing it, and they're baiting and switching.
[01:04:04.802 --> 01:04:07.822]  They're still saying it's for Al-Qaeda, but also for the American people.
[01:04:08.142 --> 01:04:09.903]  But see, it was really always for the American people.
[01:04:10.223 --> 01:04:11.663]  Al-Syeidah was their creation.
[01:04:13.063 --> 01:04:16.084]  And so, this is what we face as a society today.
[01:04:16.124 --> 01:04:19.165]  So, in closing, because I got cut off a bit there at the last hour,
[01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:26.034]  We got cut off from the network in Minnesota, but our backup kicked in, so we lost about five seconds, I'm told.
[01:04:27.095 --> 01:04:33.741]  PrisonPlanet.tv, $5.95 a month, so you can see the TV show, see the documents, see the clips we're playing, see all the proof.
[01:04:34.482 --> 01:04:36.064]  It turns the radio show into a TV show.
[01:04:37.133 --> 01:04:41.195]  I'm going to be converting in the last two hours every day to an earpiece, not headphones.
[01:04:41.215 --> 01:04:47.279]  I keep meaning to tell you guys to order me an earpiece, because we're going to pretty much go TV here in the last two hours every day.
[01:04:47.299 --> 01:04:50.341]  So I don't look like Princess Leia on the air here.
[01:04:51.081 --> 01:04:53.683]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen, for this segment.
[01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:56.925]  Coming up, we're going to talk about free speech, the Second Amendment, and a lot more.
[01:04:57.005 --> 01:05:00.267]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:05:00.427 --> 01:05:04.510]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:16.137]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:05:16.357 --> 01:05:22.181]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:05:22.261 --> 01:05:22.721]  I think so.
[01:05:44.229 --> 01:05:50.294]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:50.574 --> 01:05:51.875]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[01:06:06.181 --> 01:06:07.222]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:07.722 --> 01:06:08.222]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:08.522 --> 01:06:09.503]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:09.523 --> 01:06:10.824]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:10.864 --> 01:06:12.525]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:19.649]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.489]  Some U.S.
[01:06:20.529 --> 01:06:26.173]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:26.873 --> 01:06:30.354]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:30.374 --> 01:06:33.356]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:06:56.761 --> 01:06:57.523]  We're good to go.
[01:07:10.623 --> 01:07:11.123]  I think so.
[01:07:27.364 --> 01:07:28.364]  Garden in a Can.
[01:07:28.764 --> 01:07:29.645]  It's that simple.
[01:07:29.985 --> 01:07:31.845]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[01:07:32.365 --> 01:07:36.327]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[01:07:36.707 --> 01:07:37.627]  Ready when you are.
[01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:41.908]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.
[01:07:42.368 --> 01:07:45.449]  For more details visit GardenInACan.com today.
[01:07:45.849 --> 01:07:48.370]  That's GardenInACan.com or call 866-598-7396.
[01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.430]  866-598-7396.
[01:07:57.671 --> 01:07:59.854]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:00.434 --> 01:08:03.238]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.821]  Alright, we are live.
[01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:26.664]  I had him on a few days ago, but I want to have him up for most of an hour today, because he's got video of the police coming to the school brainwashing him, police threatening to arrest him for saying he has constitutional rights.
[01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:34.826]  They're allowed to wear t-shirts with messages in their yearbook, but he said 9-11 was an inside job, so they photoshopped it out.
[01:08:36.366 --> 01:08:45.471]  The textbook says world government's good, new world order's taking over America, but then when he says that he doesn't like that and it's not a good idea, they tell him that doesn't exist.
[01:08:45.691 --> 01:08:49.753]  So, folks, I don't think you realize just how controlled the public schools are.
[01:08:50.649 --> 01:08:52.450]  They train the children on a title on their parents.
[01:08:53.010 --> 01:09:06.176]  Going back over 15 years, they have federal grants in schools all over the nation, where they have BATF local sheriff's deputies that are given a grant to be BATF officers, auxiliary officers, in the schools.
[01:09:06.216 --> 01:09:06.917]  They have the children.
[01:09:07.817 --> 01:09:12.160]  Starting in 6th and 7th grade, in most areas, writing dossiers on their parents.
[01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:24.008]  I show those documents from Tennessee and South Carolina in my film, Police State 2 The Takeover, where it says that they write dossiers on their parents.
[01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:27.771]  It's a six-month or single-semester course.
[01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:30.292]  I guess three-month, four-month course in the school.
[01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:31.814]  All of this.
[01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.435]  And this is classical tyranny.
[01:09:34.495 --> 01:09:37.255]  Having 24 hour a day curfews is classical tyranny.
[01:09:37.536 --> 01:09:40.456]  Having the media announce they're going to use troops on the streets is classical tyranny.
[01:09:40.736 --> 01:09:42.997]  Having cameras going up everywhere is classical tyranny.
[01:09:43.457 --> 01:09:46.038]  Having face scanning systems going in everywhere is tyranny.
[01:09:46.338 --> 01:09:54.401]  All these states and the UK, but also in the US, saying we're going to put satellite tracker boxes in your car and tax you down the road and track everywhere you go.
[01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:58.782]  And by the way, we're dialing in and listening to you over your cell phone, even when it's turned off.
[01:09:59.202 --> 01:10:05.126]  By the way, your digital cable boxes watch what you watch and track everything you do, and that's reported back to the government, your TiVo system.
[01:10:05.146 --> 01:10:14.573]  And by the way, Google is using the microphones built in in computers and video cameras to watch you and listen to you with AI keyword software to keep dossiers on you.
[01:10:14.833 --> 01:10:18.035]  Google announces this and the public just goes, oh really?
[01:10:18.176 --> 01:10:19.236]  Or, oh I don't believe that.
[01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:22.439]  This is mega Orwellville.
[01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:28.223]  It's just all around us, but we still have our Second Amendment, we still have our First Amendment, but they're trying to attack those right now.
[01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:39.029]  Did you guys find that clip with Robert Wannick where he's talking about how they blacked out his shirt?
[01:10:39.989 --> 01:10:41.551]  This has been quite a saga.
[01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:48.016]  Let's play a few minutes of that, then we'll go to him, then we'll go back through everything else that's happened to him in this camp.
[01:10:48.156 --> 01:10:49.677]  It's a re-education camp.
[01:10:49.957 --> 01:10:56.303]  And for those that doubt me, in Texas, in Michigan, all over the country we've seen these reports, but I've been to these drills.
[01:10:57.065 --> 01:11:09.930]  They will, unannounced, come into a school, announce that terrorists are attacking, they will lock the children in their rooms, and this isn't in the elementary, sometimes for eight hours, they make them urinate and defecate in trash cans.
[01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:15.632]  Don't believe me, just Google, police made children defecate, or use bathroom in trash cans.
[01:11:15.652 --> 01:11:16.613]  You'll see that all over the country.
[01:11:17.353 --> 01:11:20.115]  And the cops always go, well, it was part of the federal grant, it'd be secret.
[01:11:20.635 --> 01:11:24.498]  And the children aren't fed to also freak them out and give them low blood sugar.
[01:11:24.778 --> 01:11:28.100]  They'll also have the elementary students, this has been going on for a decade, we've got footage of it.
[01:11:29.121 --> 01:11:32.103]  The first place we saw it was Missouri, right on the Kansas border.
[01:11:32.984 --> 01:11:42.090]  They would, in one town, load the elementary students at gunpoint with their hands behind their heads on buses and take them to a local FEMA center without telling the parents.
[01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:44.051]  This is part of learned helplessness.
[01:11:44.451 --> 01:11:46.693]  Training children that when men in black uniforms come, you just
[01:11:47.574 --> 01:11:48.355]  You just lay down.
[01:11:48.395 --> 01:11:49.236]  You just fall down.
[01:11:50.758 --> 01:11:51.760]  I had one lady on.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.324]  It was in the Minneapolis St.
[01:11:55.365 --> 01:11:56.767]  Paul newspaper a few years ago.
[01:11:56.787 --> 01:11:57.708]  I heard her lawyer on.
[01:11:57.748 --> 01:11:59.791]  They came unannounced to the school, even.
[01:12:00.928 --> 01:12:01.869]  Only the administrators knew.
[01:12:01.909 --> 01:12:04.671]  Went into the portable buildings, told the teachers, we're gonna kill you.
[01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:06.373]  Took them out in the woods with the children.
[01:12:06.593 --> 01:12:08.775]  People fell over, they defecated on themselves.
[01:12:08.795 --> 01:12:09.515]  This was in the news.
[01:12:09.796 --> 01:12:12.698]  They had nervous breakdowns and the cops were like, what's wrong?
[01:12:13.299 --> 01:12:17.782]  In the case of Michigan, all over the state, this was in the Associated Press four years ago.
[01:12:19.584 --> 01:12:20.204]  Google this.
[01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:23.687]  School shooting drill, Michigan.
[01:12:25.569 --> 01:12:28.592]  School... I'm trying to go back to the exact headline.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.661]  From the AP, it was all over the news.
[01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:35.604]  Police drill at School, Michigan.
[01:12:35.864 --> 01:12:45.090]  Now, the main one that comes up is, there's been three cases where the cops shoot themselves in the drills in Michigan, but I don't want those.
[01:12:45.811 --> 01:12:49.593]  For some reason, those got more visits, so those articles went to the top last time I checked.
[01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:55.317]  I want the one, and we do this on air so folks can learn how to find this that we're talking about, so this isn't just me up here saying it.
[01:12:56.437 --> 01:13:00.561]  They show up in elementary schools, they blow up a bus, set it on fire in front of everybody.
[01:13:01.342 --> 01:13:02.624]  They've done this in Belton, too.
[01:13:02.664 --> 01:13:03.184]  I caught them up.
[01:13:03.204 --> 01:13:04.105]  They had troops, U.S.
[01:13:04.165 --> 01:13:06.267]  Army, walk over and say, turn your cameras off with Marines.
[01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:08.930]  That's in Road to Tyranny in 2000.
[01:13:10.432 --> 01:13:12.113]  That's when we shot the footage that's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:13:14.013 --> 01:13:15.013]  And they get the children out.
[01:13:15.033 --> 01:13:15.874]  They don't know what's going on.
[01:13:15.914 --> 01:13:17.074]  They throw fake blood on them.
[01:13:17.495 --> 01:13:18.595]  They tell them, you're going to die.
[01:13:18.635 --> 01:13:20.796]  And the police scream, I'm a militia.
[01:13:20.936 --> 01:13:22.737]  I don't like public school.
[01:13:23.178 --> 01:13:23.878]  I'm a militia.
[01:13:24.018 --> 01:13:26.059]  I don't like you not liking my Second Amendment.
[01:13:26.479 --> 01:13:27.380]  I'm going to kill you.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.501]  For life, those children are going to hate guns.
[01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:30.722]  They're going to hate the Second Amendment.
[01:13:30.882 --> 01:13:31.862]  They're going to hate militias.
[01:13:32.243 --> 01:13:41.268]  And the name of the terror group they have in Michigan, they do this all over the country, that attacks the children, is Homeschoolers Against Public Education.
[01:13:42.288 --> 01:13:44.730]  Now, the police play the part to demonize homeschoolers.
[01:13:46.191 --> 01:13:50.415]  And they run around screaming, throwing fake blood on children, blowing things up in the parking lot.
[01:13:50.695 --> 01:13:51.696]  They had little kids come out.
[01:13:52.076 --> 01:13:59.902]  All of a sudden, vehicles jump up, men in uniforms jump out screaming, we're militias, we're against public schools, we're homeschoolers, we're going to kill you.
[01:14:00.382 --> 01:14:02.524]  And the children just go into catatonic freakouts.
[01:14:02.844 --> 01:14:04.205]  I mean, this is in the news.
[01:14:04.285 --> 01:14:07.208]  This is hardcore re-education camp.
[01:14:08.055 --> 01:14:09.924]  I mean, this is what they do in re-education camps.
[01:14:09.944 --> 01:14:13.097]  But see, now they're turning all of America into a re-education camp.
[01:14:14.338 --> 01:14:25.200]  It's a re-education camp for thousands of times from California to New York to Florida to Texas where they say, we're giving you $100 gift certificates if you come turn in your guns.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.721]  And it's always an old grandpa whose daughter, you know, he's going to the nursing home because they polled the women.
[01:14:31.921 --> 01:14:33.501]  It's always 80% women out there.
[01:14:33.801 --> 01:14:37.662]  And they're handing in $5,000 carved shotguns made in England.
[01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:42.143]  They're handing in, you know, having no idea how much money they could have made just alone to the police
[01:14:42.703 --> 01:14:52.709]  And some people bring in old cheap guns and get the $100 gift certificate, and then the image is put on the news of illegal guns being turned in, and it creates the image, the acclamation of seeing everybody turning their guns in.
[01:14:54.158 --> 01:14:55.599]  And the police always get caught.
[01:14:56.479 --> 01:15:01.742]  I've seen thousands of cases in the news over the 15 years I've been studying, 13 years on air.
[01:15:01.922 --> 01:15:03.383]  We always hear about cops selling.
[01:15:03.943 --> 01:15:04.304]  I've seen this.
[01:15:04.324 --> 01:15:09.647]  I mean, there's thousands of cases of cops selling guns that were seized or guns that were turned in.
[01:15:09.667 --> 01:15:10.827]  You can Google that.
[01:15:11.287 --> 01:15:13.088]  Were you able to find a clip?
[01:15:14.489 --> 01:15:22.534]  Well, I know that's the video clip, but were you able to find the Google about the particular one where they were telling the children they were going to kill them and that they were homeschoolers?
[01:15:23.214 --> 01:15:23.934]  We're homeschoolers.
[01:15:23.954 --> 01:15:24.715]  We're here to kill you.
[01:15:24.935 --> 01:15:26.355]  Again, to demonize homeschooling.
[01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:29.056]  This is hardcore mind control.
[01:15:30.016 --> 01:15:40.020]  But let's go ahead and play a clip of Robert Wannick where he's talking about how they restricted him from being able to engage in the First Amendment.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:40.360]  Here it is.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:46.622]  I'm going to talk about something that recently happened in school.
[01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:49.243]  Approximately 3 p.m., dismissals at 318.
[01:15:51.238 --> 01:16:00.782]  3 p.m., I was assisting a student who had been assaulted by another student, uh, with an object thrown at him, and I was talking to him, and the teacher comes over and says, Shut up.
[01:16:01.442 --> 01:16:02.383]  Say one more thing and you're out.
[01:16:02.643 --> 01:16:04.003]  And did you just see what happened to them?
[01:16:04.123 --> 01:16:05.224]  Then I said, This is America.
[01:16:05.244 --> 01:16:07.825]  This is not a dictatorship.
[01:16:08.085 --> 01:16:09.045]  She said, Leave.
[01:16:09.245 --> 01:16:10.446]  So I left.
[01:16:10.826 --> 01:16:12.147]  I sat down in the office.
[01:16:12.407 --> 01:16:13.607]  Ten minutes until school gets out.
[01:16:13.707 --> 01:16:16.068]  I said, What am I being written up for?
[01:16:16.088 --> 01:16:17.029]  Disrespect.
[01:16:17.069 --> 01:16:17.809]  I'm told to leave.
[01:16:18.951 --> 01:16:19.852]  Then, you know what?
[01:16:19.892 --> 01:16:20.692]  I'm gonna get riled up.
[01:16:20.732 --> 01:16:22.693]  So then they say, Robert, you're gonna have to be quiet.
[01:16:22.733 --> 01:16:24.054]  Why do I have to be quiet?
[01:16:24.134 --> 01:16:25.134]  Be quiet!
[01:16:25.154 --> 01:16:26.575]  Why do I have to be quiet?
[01:16:26.655 --> 01:16:27.456]  Shut up!
[01:16:27.876 --> 01:16:28.356]  Shut up!
[01:16:29.077 --> 01:16:29.437]  Shut up!
[01:16:30.357 --> 01:16:31.758]  Shut up and go in that room!
[01:16:31.818 --> 01:16:33.059]  What a disrespectful kid.
[01:16:33.079 --> 01:16:33.319]  Bad kid.
[01:16:33.379 --> 01:16:36.641]  All right, that's enough.
[01:16:37.061 --> 01:16:37.521]  That's enough.
[01:16:37.861 --> 01:16:42.204]  That's another clip where they then call the police on him for mentioning the Constitution.
[01:16:42.504 --> 01:16:44.685]  We'll get him to tell us that story himself.
[01:16:44.705 --> 01:16:47.747]  The clip I wanted to play was where the 9-11 truth t-shirt
[01:16:48.673 --> 01:16:55.495]  One of the first clips he did, but let's just go ahead and go to him, and we'll play that clip a little bit later in the show.
[01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:57.416]  Robert, good to have you back with us.
[01:16:57.996 --> 01:16:59.157]  Yeah, glad to be back on, Alex.
[01:16:59.897 --> 01:17:00.237]  You bet.
[01:17:00.577 --> 01:17:09.400]  Look, recap everything that's happened to you at this re-education camp, known as a public school, a federalization brainwashing center, social engineering center.
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:15.582]  I mean, just basically all the things that have happened, a brief synopsis of the saga, then we'll go through them all here.
[01:17:16.587 --> 01:17:26.453]  Well, last year when I was a freshman at my high school, um, everything went fine, and I wasn't a 9-11 truther, and I wasn't into this New World Order.
[01:17:27.153 --> 01:17:29.434]  And then I went to science class.
[01:17:30.515 --> 01:17:33.116]  I was told that we were going to learn about the physics of 9-11.
[01:17:33.997 --> 01:17:37.439]  They then played a hit piece movie basically saying that
[01:17:38.089 --> 01:17:43.531]  You know, the fire was hot enough to completely melt the steel, and that it was structural failure.
[01:17:43.751 --> 01:17:46.192]  Which, by the way, they admit that it didn't melt the steel now.
[01:17:46.312 --> 01:17:47.913]  Now, this even falls back on this.
[01:17:47.933 --> 01:17:49.294]  Yeah, that was an older lie.
[01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:53.415]  So you were given an older version of the Ministry of Truth.
[01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:54.075]  Go ahead.
[01:17:54.576 --> 01:17:56.857]  Yeah, and then that's how I became a 9-11 truther.
[01:17:56.937 --> 01:18:05.360]  So then, when I became big in 9-11 truth in school and started passing out flyers and DVDs, this is when I became public enemy number one.
[01:18:05.871 --> 01:18:11.692]  The principal had told my parents that he had a red flag up for me and that he was going to be watching me very closely.
[01:18:12.292 --> 01:18:15.113]  Because, just because I was standing up for 9-11 Truth.
[01:18:15.193 --> 01:18:17.113]  We got one that can see!
[01:18:17.133 --> 01:18:21.174]  You know, from They Live With The Sunglasses.
[01:18:21.194 --> 01:18:23.155]  They're like, got one that can see.
[01:18:23.175 --> 01:18:23.695]  Go ahead.
[01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:33.537]  And so then, later on in the school year, we were just in geography class and had a substitute teacher when two students began arguing.
[01:18:34.329 --> 01:18:41.831]  One student then flew, er, one student then threw an agenda book, which is a pretty, it's kind of a small item, but it's still a book.
[01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:43.292]  It's got binding on it.
[01:18:43.812 --> 01:18:45.713]  Threw it and hit another kid in the crotch.
[01:18:46.233 --> 01:18:47.873]  The kid then proceeded to fall down.
[01:18:48.693 --> 01:18:50.394]  About five minutes later, it happened again.
[01:18:50.634 --> 01:18:51.574]  Struck in the crotch again.
[01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:53.375]  This happened a total of three times.
[01:18:53.955 --> 01:18:59.357]  That's when I was sitting right next to the incident watching a movie, when I just started holding a conversation with the injured kid.
[01:18:59.937 --> 01:19:00.937]  I was told to shut up.
[01:19:01.637 --> 01:19:03.358]  Instead of retaliating against the teacher,
[01:19:03.911 --> 01:19:06.633]  I just tried to tell her, this kid has been assaulted, I'm just talking.
[01:19:07.234 --> 01:19:12.358]  She didn't want to hear it, because, you know, we got that red flag up for the 9-11 truther in the school.
[01:19:12.578 --> 01:19:15.921]  That's right, that's how a re-education camp works.
[01:19:16.281 --> 01:19:30.573]  Those that don't play ball and team up with the jail guards, they get picked on, they get ostracized, they don't get as much food, they get tortured, and they're slowly, ambiently turning up the heat until many schools are full-bore prison re-education camps.
[01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:32.397]  Exactly.
[01:19:32.437 --> 01:19:34.338]  Alright, so you're in the re-education camp.
[01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:34.878]  Continue.
[01:19:35.439 --> 01:19:36.179]  It was exactly.
[01:19:36.279 --> 01:19:37.900]  I don't care about the assault.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:38.820]  I don't want to listen to you.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.601]  You are non-conformist.
[01:19:40.661 --> 01:19:45.163]  You don't comply with hating your rights, so you just leave.
[01:19:45.183 --> 01:19:46.763]  So, I complied and I left the room.
[01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:48.004]  Alright, stay there.
[01:19:48.164 --> 01:19:48.584]  Stay there.
[01:19:49.304 --> 01:19:51.405]  You're now turned over to camp guards.
[01:19:51.585 --> 01:19:52.926]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:53.126 --> 01:19:54.426]  You are in a camp!
[01:19:54.686 --> 01:19:55.647]  You must realize it!
[01:19:56.997 --> 01:19:58.858]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:19:58.978 --> 01:20:05.683]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:20:05.963 --> 01:20:14.129]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:20:14.349 --> 01:20:20.073]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:22.034]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:20:22.074 --> 01:20:24.255]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:20:24.275 --> 01:20:28.637]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:20:28.797 --> 01:20:30.918]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:20:31.018 --> 01:20:38.481]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:20:38.641 --> 01:20:44.226]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:03.084 --> 01:21:10.866]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:11.206 --> 01:21:19.067]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:19.367 --> 01:21:24.128]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:24.468 --> 01:21:29.089]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:29.682 --> 01:21:33.525]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[01:21:34.025 --> 01:21:35.046]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:35.106 --> 01:21:39.189]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:43.993]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:44.534 --> 01:21:47.076]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:47.516 --> 01:21:49.197]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:49.297 --> 01:21:49.518]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:55.689 --> 01:21:57.711]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:21:57.831 --> 01:22:00.232]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:22:00.252 --> 01:22:02.354]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:22:02.514 --> 01:22:04.075]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:22:04.095 --> 01:22:05.716]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:22:05.796 --> 01:22:12.321]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:22:21.987 --> 01:22:26.855]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:22:30.635 --> 01:22:31.976]  How dare you?
[01:22:33.256 --> 01:22:38.138]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:22:38.158 --> 01:22:40.779]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:22:40.819 --> 01:22:47.202]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rises.
[01:22:47.502 --> 01:22:50.083]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:22:50.343 --> 01:22:52.324]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:22:52.604 --> 01:22:55.065]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:22:55.692 --> 01:23:00.516]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from HempUSA.org.
[01:23:00.737 --> 01:23:09.144]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[01:23:09.364 --> 01:23:14.049]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[01:23:14.269 --> 01:23:21.075]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[01:23:21.335 --> 01:23:27.541]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[01:23:27.721 --> 01:23:35.067]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins.
[01:23:35.208 --> 01:23:42.354]  With extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables, and fruits, improve taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[01:23:43.655 --> 01:23:47.196]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[01:23:47.416 --> 01:23:50.916]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:23:51.197 --> 01:23:53.737]  That's 908-691-2608.
[01:23:53.757 --> 01:24:07.840]  Alright, let's go back to sophomore student Robert Wonick in a federal re-education camp in Minnesota.
[01:24:11.704 --> 01:24:34.091]  By the way, you think I'm joking, Judge Jean Meir, the family court judge that has a building named after her while she's a sitting judge, giant sprawling youth complex, when the children are late to class, they're going after the good kids, they trick the parents into portable buildings that are supposed courts, none of their rights are told, no jury, no nothing, and they scream at them, this is on the news, they're proud of it, sign the form.
[01:24:35.914 --> 01:24:41.041]  Admit you're on probation for truancy when being late to class wasn't truancy under state law.
[01:24:41.061 --> 01:24:41.882]  They've been sued over it.
[01:24:42.162 --> 01:24:42.743]  They don't care.
[01:24:43.384 --> 01:24:45.566]  Then the children are now on probation.
[01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:48.050]  Now, for no reason, they can get deeper in the system.
[01:24:49.138 --> 01:24:50.940]  This is all about institutionalizing.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.742]  You're getting on Ritalin, Prozac, getting you on welfare.
[01:24:54.182 --> 01:24:57.765]  When you get your child, they advertise like it's for everybody, the Head Start program.
[01:24:57.785 --> 01:25:01.809]  They have it in all the Western countries under Secure Start, Safe Start, Head Start.
[01:25:02.289 --> 01:25:04.011]  You get three CPS visits a year.
[01:25:04.071 --> 01:25:08.755]  You're actually then listed as a ward of the state and incompetent because you're taking government money.
[01:25:09.135 --> 01:25:11.797]  This is the total... You understand, folks, I'm not lying.
[01:25:12.097 --> 01:25:13.359]  You can pull up these articles.
[01:25:14.039 --> 01:25:19.041]  Mainstream news, where they say it's good that they unannounced come in with guns and do drills and terrorize children.
[01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:20.522]  And training them to be helpless.
[01:25:20.742 --> 01:25:21.882]  Training them to go to FEMA camps.
[01:25:22.582 --> 01:25:23.563]  Alright, so continue.
[01:25:25.924 --> 01:25:31.866]  Assaults are allowed, everything's allowed in the FEMA camp, because that child believes 9-11 is an Al-Qaeda job.
[01:25:32.886 --> 01:25:34.607]  You, on the other hand, have been told you're being watched.
[01:25:34.847 --> 01:25:38.028]  You're told, get out of the class, because you reported the assault on the student.
[01:25:38.309 --> 01:25:39.129]  Please continue.
[01:25:40.014 --> 01:25:47.477]  So then I comply, not being disrespectful, I just comply and I'm told to go to the main office.
[01:25:47.757 --> 01:25:49.478]  Keep in mind that this is 3 p.m.
[01:25:49.658 --> 01:25:50.759]  and school gets out at 3.18.
[01:25:51.599 --> 01:25:53.380]  So there's only 18 minutes left of school.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.982]  They then go on and they're kind of taunting me saying, oh, you got a detention now.
[01:25:58.082 --> 01:25:59.122]  And I said, for what?
[01:25:59.743 --> 01:26:02.384]  And they go, well, how about for disrespect?
[01:26:03.104 --> 01:26:04.125]  I said, disrespect?
[01:26:04.145 --> 01:26:06.726]  I was just talking and I wasn't listened to.
[01:26:06.746 --> 01:26:09.287]  And then they said, you know what, you're gonna have to be quiet.
[01:26:09.327 --> 01:26:09.687]  And I said,
[01:26:10.197 --> 01:26:13.778]  If you can please state why I'm getting a detention, then I'll be quiet.
[01:26:14.359 --> 01:26:15.659]  Then, that really made them mad.
[01:26:16.219 --> 01:26:19.061]  They sent me into a solitary confinement type of room.
[01:26:19.661 --> 01:26:34.587]  A room with, um, three or four chairs, one middle table, and this is what they do, they give kids in-school suspension if they speak out, and if you go- if you miss a detention for any reason, even if it's legitimate, if you can't go to an after-school detention, you get sat,
[01:26:35.202 --> 01:26:39.065]  For the whole eight hours of the school day in the solitary confinement room.
[01:26:39.085 --> 01:26:44.510]  Well, that's why in the Soviet Union they had 12-hour class days, admittedly, to break up the family and get full government control.
[01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:47.132]  Now we're moving to a 10-hour, 12-hour workday.
[01:26:47.152 --> 01:26:50.595]  They tell the children, they tell the parents, keep your children in school.
[01:26:50.895 --> 01:26:51.916]  We'll take care of them.
[01:26:51.956 --> 01:26:53.157]  We have after-school programs.
[01:26:53.497 --> 01:26:55.399]  Again, making that the center of the community.
[01:26:56.119 --> 01:26:57.961]  Now continue, the police came.
[01:26:58.741 --> 01:26:58.982]  Yes.
[01:26:59.562 --> 01:27:04.206]  As I was in the solitary confinement room, they just kept going on, saying that, you know, he's a bad kid.
[01:27:04.662 --> 01:27:08.105]  He's disrespectful, just talking to themselves.
[01:27:08.125 --> 01:27:10.808]  Trying to get you to speak up so they can go after you.
[01:27:11.328 --> 01:27:11.568]  Yes.
[01:27:11.929 --> 01:27:14.711]  So then I said, I'd like an opportunity to defend myself.
[01:27:15.131 --> 01:27:15.872]  You can't talk.
[01:27:16.012 --> 01:27:18.134]  I mean, why would you talk in an indoctrination camp?
[01:27:18.434 --> 01:27:20.076]  And then I said, you know what the First Amendment is?
[01:27:20.496 --> 01:27:21.457]  I have free speech too.
[01:27:22.714 --> 01:27:23.295]  There they go.
[01:27:24.055 --> 01:27:25.777]  How dare you have a kid that knows his rights?
[01:27:26.017 --> 01:27:35.005]  By the way, a California court ruled three months ago that parents do not have their children and that the state is in control of all children in California.
[01:27:36.006 --> 01:27:38.028]  And of course, it's totally criminal they're not, but go ahead.
[01:27:38.708 --> 01:27:42.212]  Yeah, they were really on edge after I mentioned my rights.
[01:27:42.832 --> 01:27:44.874]  And then they said, well, we'll just call law enforcement.
[01:27:45.478 --> 01:27:48.679]  Keep in mind, this was when there was about 10 minutes left in the school day.
[01:27:48.859 --> 01:27:52.881]  Listen, they're arresting parents in Houston and their children don't finish their homework.
[01:27:53.281 --> 01:27:55.182]  Doesn't matter if it's on, it's all just made up.
[01:27:55.382 --> 01:27:55.722]  Go ahead.
[01:27:56.602 --> 01:28:00.024]  And then the bell rings at 318.
[01:28:00.104 --> 01:28:00.764]  No police there.
[01:28:00.804 --> 01:28:01.404]  I said, you know what?
[01:28:01.424 --> 01:28:01.905]  I'm leaving.
[01:28:02.225 --> 01:28:04.225]  A school official tried to physically stop me.
[01:28:04.266 --> 01:28:06.987]  He blocks the door and says, it'd be in your best interest to stay.
[01:28:07.587 --> 01:28:08.627]  I said, I know my rights.
[01:28:08.827 --> 01:28:10.088]  I didn't violate rules.
[01:28:10.108 --> 01:28:12.109]  I'm using the First Amendment.
[01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.849]  It's not a rule.
[01:28:13.473 --> 01:28:15.675]  Or not against the rules, even though you'd like it to be.
[01:28:16.055 --> 01:28:16.696]  I tried to leave.
[01:28:17.016 --> 01:28:20.519]  I got right by the exit door when a police officer came down the hallway.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:21.440]  Policewoman.
[01:28:21.881 --> 01:28:23.662]  She goes, come to the office right now.
[01:28:24.163 --> 01:28:26.865]  And I said, I don't consent to any conversation with you.
[01:28:27.185 --> 01:28:28.066]  She said, you don't have to.
[01:28:28.086 --> 01:28:28.927]  I'll just handcuff you.
[01:28:29.367 --> 01:28:30.028]  I said, for what?
[01:28:30.528 --> 01:28:31.850]  Tampering with an investigation.
[01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:33.871]  So I went to the office with her.
[01:28:34.252 --> 01:28:34.892]  They detained me.
[01:28:34.912 --> 01:28:36.734]  All my parents.
[01:28:37.415 --> 01:28:38.836]  They didn't call my parents in any way.
[01:28:39.232 --> 01:28:43.674]  They just detained me and a friend had to go tell my parents who were sitting outside that I was in there.
[01:28:43.694 --> 01:28:46.054]  After a little conversation about my rights.
[01:28:46.334 --> 01:28:47.355]  Oh, that's another scam!
[01:28:47.375 --> 01:29:00.779]  They like to detain the children and then if parents don't pick their children up within 15 minutes with small children, they then CPS them, claiming that they endangered the child or were negligent, that they neglected them.
[01:29:00.799 --> 01:29:01.380]  Please continue.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.501]  Yeah, they thought my parents were going to side with them.
[01:29:05.081 --> 01:29:06.821]  And, you know, say, hey, this kid's disrespectful.
[01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:07.442]  He's out of line.
[01:29:07.462 --> 01:29:08.182]  You got to punish him.
[01:29:08.723 --> 01:29:10.745]  My parents just basically said, no way.
[01:29:11.266 --> 01:29:12.487]  You're acting fascist.
[01:29:12.587 --> 01:29:13.989]  You can't take away students' rights.
[01:29:14.569 --> 01:29:17.633]  And we're proud of our son for standing up for free speech.
[01:29:18.394 --> 01:29:19.595]  And you called the police state in.
[01:29:20.155 --> 01:29:22.198]  My son's not going to let you usher in the police state.
[01:29:22.598 --> 01:29:23.299]  And we just left.
[01:29:23.359 --> 01:29:24.080]  We walked out of there.
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:35.968]  Now, I want to hear about some of the other things that have happened since then, and how they're horning in on you now, and how we can counter-strike at the enemy operation, peacefully, with the First Amendment.
[01:29:36.349 --> 01:29:38.691]  We need to have you and a few of your friends get together.
[01:29:38.711 --> 01:29:44.215]  We need to send you a couple hundred of DVDs of mine to hand out to everybody at the school.
[01:29:44.235 --> 01:29:45.376]  It's your First Amendment right.
[01:29:45.516 --> 01:29:46.497]  You're not in a FEMA camp.
[01:29:46.877 --> 01:29:47.758]  We're on the march.
[01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:49.840]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.801 --> 01:29:53.483]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.318 --> 01:30:02.643]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[01:30:03.084 --> 01:30:04.826]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[01:30:05.366 --> 01:30:06.868]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[01:30:07.508 --> 01:30:11.112]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[01:30:11.513 --> 01:30:15.036]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[01:30:15.497 --> 01:30:19.821]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds
[01:30:26.169 --> 01:30:26.449]  We're good.
[01:30:56.684 --> 01:31:03.089]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:03.469 --> 01:31:05.430]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:06.111 --> 01:31:07.131]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:07.652 --> 01:31:08.172]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:08.452 --> 01:31:09.373]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:09.413 --> 01:31:10.754]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:10.814 --> 01:31:12.455]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:12.815 --> 01:31:19.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:20.401]  Some U.S.
[01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:26.085]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:26.785 --> 01:31:30.267]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:30.287 --> 01:31:33.088]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:56.539 --> 01:31:57.119]  We're good to go.
[01:32:15.208 --> 01:32:18.771]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[01:32:19.091 --> 01:32:25.076]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:32:25.316 --> 01:32:28.859]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:32:29.119 --> 01:32:33.643]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:32:33.923 --> 01:32:34.704]  Do your part.
[01:32:34.984 --> 01:32:37.246]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[01:32:37.586 --> 01:32:43.731]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:32:43.951 --> 01:32:46.994]  We're gonna go back to Robert Warnock here in just a moment.
[01:32:47.054 --> 01:32:48.095]  But what I'm gonna do is...
[01:33:10.413 --> 01:33:14.275]  I'm going to mail 100 copies.
[01:33:14.635 --> 01:33:25.882]  100 copies of Truth Rising, the preeminent 9-11 film out there showing the activists, the police in New York coming up and saying, your cameras are guns, and grabbing them.
[01:33:26.621 --> 01:33:35.324]  And then saying we're going to charge you for having guns and bombs for standing out front Larry Silverstein's New Building 7 and laying out the fact that it was blown up at an inside job.
[01:33:36.045 --> 01:33:39.746]  We have firefighters, police, emergency workers on tape saying the government blew it up.
[01:33:40.086 --> 01:33:41.547]  We have Silverstein saying they blew it up.
[01:33:41.927 --> 01:33:46.248]  I mean that's just five minutes of the two-hour film, but that's the perfect film.
[01:33:46.529 --> 01:33:47.909]  One hundred copies.
[01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:49.310]  Robert, we're going to go back to you in a minute.
[01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.910]  I'm going to
[01:33:51.431 --> 01:33:52.192]  I'm going to get your address.
[01:33:52.232 --> 01:33:55.073]  I'm going to mail you 100 copies of these.
[01:33:55.654 --> 01:33:57.215]  And it is your First Amendment right.
[01:33:57.875 --> 01:34:03.619]  Or what you can also do, if they try to violate your First Amendment, it's a gift.
[01:34:03.639 --> 01:34:04.560]  You're giving a gift.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:06.361]  I know they've told you not to hand stuff out before.
[01:34:06.381 --> 01:34:08.802]  You've told us, saying it's political speech.
[01:34:09.963 --> 01:34:11.344]  Well, of course it's political speech.
[01:34:11.824 --> 01:34:12.445]  Campaigning.
[01:34:12.465 --> 01:34:13.345]  It's not campaigning.
[01:34:13.946 --> 01:34:17.328]  But now they isolate with these campaign laws, but they're misapp...
[01:34:17.868 --> 01:34:23.334]  Miss, uh, appointing, misusing that, because there's no specific law on you, uh, you know, giving out any material.
[01:34:23.354 --> 01:34:24.555]  You say no First Amendment.
[01:34:24.876 --> 01:34:28.520]  Or if you want, and we're going to go back to you in a minute, I just want to make this point.
[01:34:30.017 --> 01:34:33.620]  If you want, what you do is, you start a student organization.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.782]  And if they try to stop you there, you've got a major lawsuit.
[01:34:36.382 --> 01:34:39.165]  And I'd call it Students for Free Speech, in the name of your school.
[01:34:39.545 --> 01:34:41.787]  And then they can't stop you from meeting after school.
[01:34:41.827 --> 01:34:44.729]  They can't stop you from meeting in the library or meeting somewhere else.
[01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:46.811]  They'll probably try to send provocateurs in.
[01:34:47.191 --> 01:34:50.975]  And then you can hand out those films, or you can get ten of your friends to hand out ten apiece.
[01:34:51.915 --> 01:34:53.857]  And then even videotape, you know, handing those out.
[01:34:54.157 --> 01:34:57.961]  Or you can tell everybody, meet me out on the corner, off the school property.
[01:34:58.581 --> 01:35:03.583]  Because that's even better, then they'll come and stop that, and it will illustrate who they are.
[01:35:04.645 --> 01:35:16.051]  In America, something out of the Soviet Union, give them the 100 copies, but keep a few copies, buy a DVD burner, and burn copies of Truth Rising, and then that way it can be endless.
[01:35:16.491 --> 01:35:31.198]  And then get together with 10, 20 of your friends, recruit more people to where it's not just you having to pay to make copies of them, and then give everybody in the school a Truth Rising, and explain to them that the government camp, we're rebelling with the First Amendment inside the camp.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.742]  That you're not going to go along with that.
[01:35:33.782 --> 01:35:40.689]  Now, before we go back to him, I want to tell the listeners out there, we can't give people 100 DVDs without support.
[01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:53.602]  I'm going to send you 100 9-11-was-an-inside-job bumper stickers, and I'm going to peacefully make excuses and peacefully give people those in America.
[01:35:54.483 --> 01:35:57.966]  And I'm going to send you a hundred Truth Rising DVDs.
[01:35:58.487 --> 01:36:00.028]  So we'll go back to you here in just a moment.
[01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:09.857]  I would ask the listeners to support us to go to Infowars.com and buy Truth Rising, buy Endgame, buy Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:36:10.726 --> 01:36:26.370]  I also, I'm putting you on the spot, but check it during a break if you can, give us the address for the school, the government training camp known as a school, the Federalization Center, the Brainwashing Center, so people can peacefully mail nice letters to the school with copies of my films or other films and material.
[01:36:28.126 --> 01:36:32.209]  That way, we can saturate the administration, who probably aren't evil people.
[01:36:32.249 --> 01:36:34.411]  They've been conditioned that this tyranny is okay.
[01:36:34.791 --> 01:36:39.115]  They've been conditioned that citizens speaking out and being involved is a bad thing.
[01:36:39.495 --> 01:36:49.823]  And for those that are doubting this, it's illegal under the federally written guidelines that schools have adopted and states have adopted, that when you're late to class three times in Austin, Texas, they arrest you.
[01:36:51.892 --> 01:36:52.793]  They tell you're under arrest.
[01:36:52.813 --> 01:36:53.753]  They come pull you out of school.
[01:36:54.093 --> 01:36:55.054]  They have your parents come down.
[01:36:55.094 --> 01:36:57.295]  They bring you to a little courtroom in the schools.
[01:36:57.315 --> 01:36:58.096]  This is all over the country.
[01:36:58.576 --> 01:36:59.497]  Most schools have it.
[01:36:59.757 --> 01:37:00.357]  Most school districts.
[01:37:00.798 --> 01:37:03.299]  And they tell you, OK, you have got truancy.
[01:37:03.319 --> 01:37:03.880]  You're a criminal.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.841]  You're going to go to jail if you don't sign this.
[01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:09.263]  In a free country, they don't say, you're going to jail if you don't sign this.
[01:37:09.283 --> 01:37:11.865]  Because the truth is, they couldn't send you to jail for being late to class.
[01:37:11.885 --> 01:37:17.028]  They're, again, twisting the truancy law, which is 14 unexcused absences in a semester in Texas.
[01:37:17.668 --> 01:37:18.369]  They call it the
[01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:25.226]  Absent student assistance program in Austin.
[01:37:25.286 --> 01:37:28.508]  We sued them 10 years ago and they had to back off for a while.
[01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:31.971]  This would be where the whole family has the flu.
[01:37:32.031 --> 01:37:33.012]  This happened to Mike Hampson.
[01:37:33.032 --> 01:37:34.794]  They're all sick on their backs in their beds.
[01:37:37.757 --> 01:37:43.522]  Mike Hanson then, you know, knock, knock, knock, within two hours of his children not being at school, instead of just calling and saying, where are your children?
[01:37:44.262 --> 01:37:47.345]  Or a note, or asking for a note the next day, now they're there, banging.
[01:37:47.665 --> 01:37:50.808]  And they come to the door with the flu, and the cop goes, let me in, let me in.
[01:37:51.488 --> 01:37:52.870]  You know, you're a child's truant.
[01:37:52.890 --> 01:37:53.810]  And he's like, what?
[01:37:54.811 --> 01:37:58.873]  And then they called more police, and then we went down and made a big deal out of it.
[01:37:58.893 --> 01:38:01.375]  They were stealing people's kids everywhere, and they had to back off a bit.
[01:38:01.795 --> 01:38:03.036]  The point is, it's lawless.
[01:38:03.316 --> 01:38:04.116]  Just like schools.
[01:38:04.377 --> 01:38:06.498]  Remember the Maryland case last year?
[01:38:06.518 --> 01:38:07.598]  It was on the news.
[01:38:07.738 --> 01:38:10.640]  Police dogs, 2,000 children outside a courthouse being injected.
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:13.562]  The judge out there saying it's the law, you have to take vaccinations.
[01:38:13.602 --> 01:38:14.982]  The people crying, saying, I don't want them.
[01:38:15.343 --> 01:38:16.163]  I hear they're bad for me.
[01:38:16.463 --> 01:38:17.064]  There was no law.
[01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:18.004]  I had the state
[01:38:21.406 --> 01:38:26.411]  prosecutor on from from and he was based in Prince George County and he said I don't vaccinate my kids.
[01:38:26.431 --> 01:38:27.492]  Yeah you're right it was no law.
[01:38:27.752 --> 01:38:29.193]  Yeah you're right we're using truancy laws.
[01:38:29.213 --> 01:38:42.325]  See they say oh you haven't vaccinated so you can't be in school and then when they kick you out of school for not being vaccinated they've made you truant then they charge you with truancy when there's no law you had to have the shot and they have to give you a waiver if you ask for it.
[01:38:43.005 --> 01:38:44.847]  So see it's all color of law crime.
[01:38:45.087 --> 01:38:47.169]  It's very very corrupt very very wicked
[01:38:48.735 --> 01:38:55.118]  And you can't make this type of stuff up, so we're going to go back to Robert here in just one moment, and I'm going to take calls specifically for our guests.
[01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:59.580]  So give me a new list, please, John of Minnesota, of callers that specifically want to talk to the guest.
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:03.722]  I'm sorry to the others that are holding from earlier, but, ah hell, we'll take all your calls.
[01:39:03.742 --> 01:39:10.325]  The point is, I figure you want to hear a few comments directly, or what's happening in your child's school, or if you're a young person.
[01:39:11.704 --> 01:39:15.226]  I kind of need to clear the phone lines so young people can call in with their own stories briefly.
[01:39:15.466 --> 01:39:16.487]  We could do hours on this.
[01:39:16.527 --> 01:39:22.830]  But before I go back to our guest, I want to tell folks about MySolarBackup.com.
[01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:24.671]  The website's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:39:24.691 --> 01:39:27.292]  There's big banners up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPundit.com.
[01:39:27.633 --> 01:39:31.155]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice, storms.
[01:39:31.555 --> 01:39:34.096]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid or being self-sufficient.
[01:39:34.116 --> 01:39:34.917]  Here's a good way to do that.
[01:39:35.717 --> 01:39:40.039]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:39:40.479 --> 01:39:44.761]  It's designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[01:39:45.161 --> 01:39:53.125]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:39:54.505 --> 01:39:56.646]  So folks, I hope you check them out at MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:39:56.666 --> 01:39:56.786]  877-327-0365.
[01:39:56.866 --> 01:39:57.327]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:39:57.347 --> 01:39:57.727]  A great unit.
[01:40:05.925 --> 01:40:06.929]  And on top of that...
[01:40:08.106 --> 01:40:09.767]  Please go to Infowars.com.
[01:40:09.867 --> 01:40:13.169]  Please get Endgame, get Terrorstorm, get Truth Rising, Fabled Enemies.
[01:40:13.690 --> 01:40:15.351]  The establishment doesn't want people to see these.
[01:40:15.591 --> 01:40:16.712]  This is hurting them badly.
[01:40:17.552 --> 01:40:21.795]  The power of giving people in this visual society, visual learners, these films.
[01:40:22.075 --> 01:40:24.397]  These are hard-hitting, compelling, exciting, well done.
[01:40:24.837 --> 01:40:26.038]  These are the best films out there.
[01:40:26.098 --> 01:40:27.159]  People need to see them.
[01:40:27.419 --> 01:40:32.642]  And if you have my films, and you've seen them, but you haven't made copies, make copies or give the copies you've got to people.
[01:40:33.023 --> 01:40:34.183]  Spread this information.
[01:40:34.243 --> 01:40:36.885]  People are ready to hear and listen like never before.
[01:40:36.985 --> 01:40:37.826]  Now, Robert Wannick,
[01:40:38.727 --> 01:40:40.649]  Again, it's your First Amendment right.
[01:40:41.129 --> 01:40:42.311]  We're standing behind you.
[01:40:42.331 --> 01:40:45.434]  You need to do this in a professional manner, which you've been doing.
[01:40:46.856 --> 01:40:49.238]  But understand, you are in danger.
[01:40:49.258 --> 01:40:53.483]  I mean, they will try to trump stuff up, at least in past experience with other schools.
[01:40:53.523 --> 01:40:56.787]  So I would be very professional, very calm about all this.
[01:40:56.807 --> 01:40:59.069]  I would officially start your own student group.
[01:40:59.690 --> 01:41:02.691]  See, now that we have the students on our side, I can get other students to hand these out.
[01:41:28.345 --> 01:41:30.347]  We can hand these out to all the students.
[01:41:30.387 --> 01:41:32.388]  They will willingly take them and watch them.
[01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:35.090]  All these students follow my YouTube channel.
[01:41:35.591 --> 01:41:39.073]  I've gotten compliments from the principal's son on some of my videos.
[01:41:39.694 --> 01:41:41.515]  And these DVDs will be a hit in the school.
[01:41:41.535 --> 01:41:43.336]  These bumper stickers will go all over.
[01:41:43.617 --> 01:41:46.439]  They'll circulate like complete madness.
[01:41:46.739 --> 01:41:50.562]  Even people that aren't big in 9-11 Truth will get involved just because
[01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:53.710]  They already dislike the school and they're already sick of the tyranny.
[01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:54.491]  Exactly!
[01:41:54.531 --> 01:41:56.072]  That's the beauty of resistance.
[01:41:56.352 --> 01:41:58.393]  It's exciting, it's fun, it's historical.
[01:41:58.753 --> 01:42:01.274]  Just, you know, what I would call your group, the Sons of Liberty.
[01:42:01.855 --> 01:42:07.037]  And they already, they already, they already like, they already dislike what's going on to them at school.
[01:42:07.337 --> 01:42:10.139]  This gives them one more reason to, you know,
[01:42:10.686 --> 01:42:12.107]  Kind of question the official story.
[01:42:12.127 --> 01:42:14.169]  They question their school.
[01:42:14.309 --> 01:42:15.550]  They question the local police.
[01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:17.451]  And now they question their government.
[01:42:17.491 --> 01:42:18.592]  They see the big picture.
[01:42:18.872 --> 01:42:21.855]  And they see that it's actually happening at local levels like the school.
[01:42:22.095 --> 01:42:24.837]  But they know that it trickles on up to the federal government.
[01:42:26.255 --> 01:42:26.936]  Absolutely.
[01:42:27.256 --> 01:42:27.897]  Absolutely.
[01:42:27.957 --> 01:42:29.499]  Just beautiful what you're doing.
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:33.864]  And again, they act like we're evil, we're crazy because we want to speak out.
[01:42:34.405 --> 01:42:35.426]  I wouldn't speak out in class.
[01:42:35.466 --> 01:42:35.967]  I wouldn't interrupt.
[01:42:36.027 --> 01:42:36.928]  I'd speak out at lunch.
[01:42:36.988 --> 01:42:39.451]  I'd speak out in between classes.
[01:42:42.074 --> 01:42:43.634]  And see, they understand counterculture.
[01:42:43.674 --> 01:42:45.755]  So MTV says, oh, have purple hair.
[01:42:45.795 --> 01:42:47.055]  I'm not saying purple hair is bad.
[01:42:47.455 --> 01:42:49.816]  Last week I said, you know, people are in their own niche.
[01:42:49.876 --> 01:42:53.637]  Cowboy hats, you know, golf outfits, purple mohawks, blue mohawks.
[01:42:54.277 --> 01:42:56.898]  I'm not, I don't care about cowboy hats or purple mohawks.
[01:42:57.018 --> 01:42:58.358]  However your style is, that's great.
[01:42:58.698 --> 01:43:04.500]  But people make that style, hip-hop outfits, suits and ties, whatever, they make that who they are.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.421]  Instead of what their psyches are.
[01:43:06.821 --> 01:43:14.486]  And so I'm saying be liberty lovers, be freedom fighters, and realize that if we just take action, we've got right on our side, history on our side.
[01:43:14.706 --> 01:43:19.328]  This New World Order can't stand if more people do what Robert Wannick and others are doing.
[01:43:19.829 --> 01:43:21.169]  So, fantastic.
[01:43:21.650 --> 01:43:23.291]  Also, during the next break, give us your address.
[01:43:23.311 --> 01:43:26.693]  I'm going to mail you a hundred DVDs and a hundred bumper stickers, maybe even more.
[01:43:27.293 --> 01:43:33.296]  I just got to watch it or we'll be out of business here pretty quick, because our expenses are mounting and the economy's imploding, but it doesn't matter.
[01:43:33.356 --> 01:43:37.438]  Now's the time to fight like never before, because this is all imploding.
[01:43:37.698 --> 01:43:42.080]  I want to take some phone calls for you, but anything else, Robert, you want to add about what's happened to you?
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.401]  I mean, what's happened since?
[01:43:43.441 --> 01:43:47.143]  You've stood up, you've bucked the system, and now you... The same thing happened...
[01:43:48.607 --> 01:43:51.369]  Eight years ago in Louisiana, World Net Daily broke the story.
[01:43:51.389 --> 01:43:52.771]  It was in local news as well.
[01:43:52.911 --> 01:43:54.172]  I remember having the students on.
[01:43:54.932 --> 01:43:56.874]  They made them wear ID badges around their necks.
[01:43:57.014 --> 01:43:59.116]  And the students learned that they could read the barcodes.
[01:43:59.136 --> 01:44:02.038]  Because barcodes, certain fatnesses, you know, are certain numbers.
[01:44:02.699 --> 01:44:04.861]  So people learned that they could read their social security number.
[01:44:05.521 --> 01:44:07.723]  And so the students said, take the social security number off.
[01:44:08.063 --> 01:44:10.645]  And they said no, end school suspension for asking questions.
[01:44:11.046 --> 01:44:20.313]  He refused, then I think it was ten students refused, then half the students refused, they tried to kick the first students out of school, the whole school had to pull the IDs out.
[01:44:21.014 --> 01:44:22.495]  The slave badge numbers.
[01:44:22.815 --> 01:44:26.778]  So we can do the same thing over and over again on other issues.
[01:44:26.818 --> 01:44:28.400]  Do they make you wear IDs?
[01:44:29.577 --> 01:44:31.317]  No, they don't make you wear IDs.
[01:44:31.578 --> 01:44:32.798]  But they do have cameras, right?
[01:44:32.878 --> 01:44:33.458]  One thing, yes.
[01:44:33.798 --> 01:44:34.938]  Cameras all over the school.
[01:44:34.958 --> 01:44:39.400]  Cameras on the ceiling, cameras in the gym, cameras right outside the bathrooms.
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:41.560]  You see when you're going in the bathroom, when you're coming out.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.241]  Every hallway, all over the place, even though we are a civil school.
[01:44:46.281 --> 01:44:47.582]  And I'd like to mention something quick.
[01:44:48.042 --> 01:44:52.883]  Yesterday, I made a trailer for a film idea I have called Education or Indoctrination.
[01:44:53.123 --> 01:44:55.004]  It's gotten 40,000 hits in one day.
[01:44:56.647 --> 01:45:04.974]  I'm asking students to mail or to send any activism videos at your school or out in public, 9-11 Truth or Fighting the Indoctrination, whatever.
[01:45:05.415 --> 01:45:15.844]  Any pictures or videos you have, handing out DVDs or flyers, send them to 911bloggeratlive.com and I'm going to compile them and I'm going to make a video of the youth fighting back.
[01:45:16.605 --> 01:45:16.965]  Beautiful.
[01:45:18.428 --> 01:45:18.829]  Absolutely.
[01:45:18.869 --> 01:45:21.431]  And again, folks, it isn't just Robert Warnock.
[01:45:21.491 --> 01:45:22.672]  It isn't just Alex Jones.
[01:45:23.113 --> 01:45:25.034]  Notice, Robert Warnock isn't infighting.
[01:45:25.054 --> 01:45:26.836]  He isn't attacking certain groups.
[01:45:26.876 --> 01:45:28.558]  He isn't obsessing on one point.
[01:45:28.798 --> 01:45:32.822]  He is standing up for liberty and freedom, which everybody agrees with, and he's having huge success.
[01:45:33.442 --> 01:45:39.684]  Take enough respect, and hundreds of other YouTube channels getting millions and millions of views, and Robert is close to getting a million.
[01:45:39.704 --> 01:45:46.805]  I know you've got some videos with 90,000 people that have watched, 100,000 have watched, 50,000 have watched, one day 40,000 have watched.
[01:45:47.165 --> 01:45:49.766]  That's why they're moving to shut down YouTube for free speech.
[01:45:49.786 --> 01:45:53.367]  That's why Congress is having hearings about us and 9-11 Truth.
[01:45:53.427 --> 01:45:57.388]  I mean, putting Richard Gage on the screen saying these are terrorists,
[01:45:57.688 --> 01:46:01.412]  I mean, this is on C-SPAN, because they know we're on to them.
[01:46:01.532 --> 01:46:03.815]  They know, we know they did the attacks.
[01:46:04.315 --> 01:46:05.116]  They're criminals.
[01:46:05.156 --> 01:46:07.279]  They've stolen $8.5 trillion.
[01:46:07.799 --> 01:46:09.921]  They've openly threatened Congress with martial law.
[01:46:09.961 --> 01:46:17.349]  Bloomberg Financial reported the War Powers Act has been declared against Congress, and they've been told the Federal Reserve now owns America!
[01:46:17.970 --> 01:46:19.971]  This is a criminal fraud.
[01:46:20.011 --> 01:46:23.253]  If we just say no to the fraud, it will fall.
[01:46:23.673 --> 01:46:39.982]  But if we let the establishment and their suits and ties and their little outfits act official and sell this on us, they'll get away with it and be able to put troops on the streets and be able to keep killing people with the tasers and continue to put people in FEMA camps and get people in the system and ship their narcotics in to then break down our society.
[01:46:40.982 --> 01:46:44.828]  We have to defeat this, we have to fight it, and I salute you, Robert Wannick.
[01:46:45.409 --> 01:46:45.769]  Yes!
[01:46:46.610 --> 01:46:48.473]  Absolutely, this is just fantastic.
[01:46:48.493 --> 01:46:50.916]  You can also send those videos to the Alex Jones Channel.
[01:46:51.317 --> 01:46:53.580]  We're now working with the guy that started that up on YouTube with...
[01:46:54.797 --> 01:46:56.918]  I think it's like 100,000 subscribers now or something.
[01:46:57.518 --> 01:46:58.198]  Just insane.
[01:46:58.218 --> 01:47:00.218]  One of the biggest YouTube channels out there now.
[01:47:00.818 --> 01:47:04.959]  We hope that people will send those there as well, or edit them, put them on your own YouTube channel.
[01:47:05.239 --> 01:47:06.000]  We'll link to them.
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.800]  Just get, your video doesn't have to be perfect, just get it out.
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:14.101]  Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air with a 21st century 14 year old Paul Revere.
[01:47:14.862 --> 01:47:16.042]  Thank you, I want to applaud Mr.
[01:47:17.864 --> 01:47:18.765]  Sorry about my voice.
[01:47:18.825 --> 01:47:26.651]  It's shot because I spent New Year's Eve shouting 9-11 as an inside job, wearing my 9-11 inside job t-shirt in front of the cops.
[01:47:27.211 --> 01:47:34.056]  And I know cops aren't... Austin cops are not all angels, but I'll tell you, the ones who worked New Year's Eve on 6th Street, they protected me.
[01:47:34.557 --> 01:47:42.042]  They protected me against this crazy Marine who was shouting at me and calling me names, and who hates the Army and the Navy.
[01:47:42.062 --> 01:47:45.625]  I was trying to tell them about Ron Paul being an Air Force veteran for five years.
[01:47:46.078 --> 01:47:47.299]  He was putting down the airport.
[01:47:47.379 --> 01:47:50.441]  I mean, these guys, like you said, he knows not what he's doing.
[01:47:50.821 --> 01:47:52.202]  All these groups are so hateful.
[01:47:52.443 --> 01:47:53.623]  The Army hates the Marines.
[01:47:53.663 --> 01:47:54.724]  The Marines hate the Army.
[01:47:55.345 --> 01:47:56.445]  It's just all tribalism.
[01:47:56.786 --> 01:47:57.226]  It's crazy.
[01:47:57.306 --> 01:47:57.506]  Yeah.
[01:47:57.686 --> 01:48:01.609]  And so I just wanted to share that little story with you about 6th Street.
[01:48:01.649 --> 01:48:02.490]  It was really happening.
[01:48:02.530 --> 01:48:05.572]  And one little tiny thing was Jennifer Gale.
[01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:09.735]  I know you say you don't pay attention to the local news, but here's a local hero who
[01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:16.752]  For years has been doing more than her share of political activity, going to all the city council meetings.
[01:48:17.253 --> 01:48:20.734]  I got to know her at the Travis County Commissioner's Court meetings that I go to all the time now.
[01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:32.738]  And she, in spite of being, she's born a man, lived as a woman, and was actually homeless, she fought all kinds of battles for you and me, for all of us, for the good of everybody to have a better life here.
[01:48:33.058 --> 01:48:37.800]  And she was constantly harassed, and I think she was assassinated, this was like a couple weeks ago.
[01:48:38.277 --> 01:48:40.400]  Wait a minute, you mean that big guy?
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:42.583]  Yeah, that same Jennifer Gale.
[01:48:43.084 --> 01:48:44.365]  And she was assassinated.
[01:48:44.726 --> 01:48:45.787]  She's younger than I am.
[01:48:45.928 --> 01:48:48.191]  And she turned up dead suddenly.
[01:48:48.391 --> 01:48:51.135]  And I think there needs to be an investigation.
[01:48:51.155 --> 01:48:52.196]  Alright, we'll look into that.
[01:48:52.216 --> 01:48:52.897]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:53.815 --> 01:48:55.536]  I don't ignore the local stuff.
[01:48:55.676 --> 01:49:05.801]  I've said I can't keep track of the international and national, and so I'm criticized, because people criticize anything who don't take action in life, for not being at more local stuff.
[01:49:06.241 --> 01:49:10.183]  But then if I go to local stuff, I get criticized, like, why is he here taking over the local stuff?
[01:49:10.603 --> 01:49:14.467]  You know, and so that's not what I'm saying, that's not what I'm doing.
[01:49:14.868 --> 01:49:27.702]  You've got a lot of folks that have moved into town who then, their business is to attack me and lie about me as a side issue, I believe as an operation, because they know Austin's a core of resistance, and so I just ignore all of that.
[01:49:28.643 --> 01:49:30.925]  You know, folks, I'm under attack because I stand up for you.
[01:49:30.985 --> 01:49:32.566]  When I lose freedom, you lose freedom.
[01:49:32.746 --> 01:49:34.187]  When you lose freedom, I lose freedom.
[01:49:34.367 --> 01:49:38.871]  When bad stuff happens to you, I feel like it's happening to me, because I know we're all interconnected.
[01:49:39.351 --> 01:49:40.552]  Let's jam in another phone call.
[01:49:42.193 --> 01:49:43.574]  Let's talk to James in Mass.
[01:49:43.654 --> 01:49:44.555]  James, you're on the air.
[01:49:45.295 --> 01:49:45.796]  Hi, Alex.
[01:49:45.836 --> 01:49:48.818]  Welcome from the frozen north again.
[01:49:49.318 --> 01:49:54.762]  I called up originally to talk to Bob about the gold sales.
[01:49:55.062 --> 01:49:56.824]  Apparently some places are
[01:49:57.898 --> 01:49:59.480]  Mostly shipping outside the U.S.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:00.541]  I don't know what that's all about.
[01:50:00.582 --> 01:50:02.324]  Maybe I'll address it later on.
[01:50:02.784 --> 01:50:07.190]  As far as the water kid goes, kid you got guts.
[01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:09.413]  I'm glad to see you're doing what you're doing.
[01:50:09.453 --> 01:50:14.059]  I hope there's a lot more like you if you're suffering from a congenital disease.
[01:50:14.099 --> 01:50:16.001]  I hope it's infectious and you pass it around.
[01:50:16.553 --> 01:50:17.654]  No, exactly.
[01:50:17.734 --> 01:50:18.794]  Liberty is infectious.
[01:50:19.075 --> 01:50:19.835]  We're the winners.
[01:50:20.055 --> 01:50:20.976]  We are the future.
[01:50:21.256 --> 01:50:21.896]  We're going to win.
[01:50:21.936 --> 01:50:26.099]  But specifically, so I'm going to skip this break for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers because we're almost out of time.
[01:50:26.139 --> 01:50:27.340]  I want to take more calls.
[01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:31.082]  But let me answer this during the PrisonPlanet.tv behind the scenes for viewers.
[01:50:31.583 --> 01:50:34.244]  Specifically, what are you asking about gold, international shipments?
[01:50:34.264 --> 01:50:35.225]  I don't understand the question.
[01:50:35.665 --> 01:50:37.186]  I'm on the Kitco site now.
[01:50:37.647 --> 01:50:41.649]  I hit that at least once a day to see what crude and everything is.
[01:50:41.729 --> 01:50:45.752]  They have a sell price page and all their
[01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:50.693]  Their small denomination coins are for shipment outside the U.S.
[01:50:50.913 --> 01:50:51.174]  only.
[01:50:51.974 --> 01:50:54.657]  If you want to buy gold, you've got to buy a large amount.
[01:50:54.877 --> 01:50:56.078]  All right, let me comment on that.
[01:50:56.118 --> 01:50:56.798]  Let me comment on that.
[01:50:56.818 --> 01:50:57.639]  Here we go.
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:00.181]  You know, so we're congruent here.
[01:51:00.201 --> 01:51:02.823]  I'm going to answer his question when we come back to the full audience.
[01:51:03.824 --> 01:51:07.907]  Right now we're just on the internet, streams at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:13.472]  I'll come back and answer that gold comment when we come back in the final full segment with the Ammonatham affiliates.
[01:51:13.932 --> 01:51:15.573]  Michael in Idaho, you're on the air.
[01:51:15.613 --> 01:51:15.954]  Go ahead.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.361]  Again, Michael, we're on the air.
[01:51:21.481 --> 01:51:21.921]  Go ahead.
[01:51:22.362 --> 01:51:23.362]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:51:24.043 --> 01:51:30.707]  I want to thank that young man for all his hard work, and I'll tell you right now, we need more of him.
[01:51:32.208 --> 01:51:32.748]  Absolutely.
[01:51:33.208 --> 01:51:46.377]  You know, and I'm an armorer here in Idaho and stuff, and I remember way back when I was in high school and how they worked back then in Kansas, and I'll tell you right now that things do stay the same.
[01:51:47.278 --> 01:51:49.439]  But I might want to make a suggestion for him.
[01:51:49.821 --> 01:51:53.564]  Start a little study group outside of the school realm.
[01:51:54.204 --> 01:51:54.765]  Exactly!
[01:51:54.885 --> 01:52:01.870]  Start meeting at a local library, and instead of taking drugs and partying, which you're not doing, be the man you are.
[01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:04.552]  They teach us to become men when we're 20, instead of being men when we're like 12.
[01:52:04.632 --> 01:52:10.917]  Look, I've mentored a lot of young men in the service, and our youth is our future.
[01:52:11.697 --> 01:52:16.381]  And I'll tell you right now that if we don't get a hold of our youth, we lose.
[01:52:16.989 --> 01:52:19.570]  Our youth are falling apart because they don't have real missions.
[01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:22.931]  They don't understand their destiny and how important they are.
[01:52:23.211 --> 01:52:26.292]  They aren't given the proper responsibilities early enough.
[01:52:26.512 --> 01:52:28.913]  We're told to be a bunch of fools and so we never mature.
[01:52:28.933 --> 01:52:33.495]  If somebody doesn't become a man by the time they're about 14 or 15, they probably never will.
[01:52:33.715 --> 01:52:35.656]  The key is becoming a man early.
[01:52:36.336 --> 01:52:40.077]  And for the outside study groups, we do street actions.
[01:52:40.137 --> 01:52:41.798]  We have youth here that do street actions.
[01:52:42.238 --> 01:52:45.039]  I'm part of Minnesota Change, and if you're from Minnesota,
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:46.160]  That's right.
[01:52:59.847 --> 01:53:03.568]  That they're teaching us are completely saturated with propaganda.
[01:53:03.648 --> 01:53:04.008]  Alright.
[01:53:04.249 --> 01:53:07.250]  And that we won't watch TV and just be mesmerized.
[01:53:07.630 --> 01:53:08.090]  Exactly.
[01:53:08.130 --> 01:53:12.591]  Going back to the armorer, what did you think of the breakdown of Barack Obama?
[01:53:12.631 --> 01:53:18.874]  I mean, he is admittedly for gun bans, we have his votes, and then he twists it and says, well, I just want to be reasonable.
[01:53:19.974 --> 01:53:28.557]  I'll tell you right now that within the body of all the dealers that I know and within the military, and the men I know within the military, they see his pulse.
[01:53:29.443 --> 01:53:41.490]  And the sad thing of it is, one of the biggest statements from the soldiers I know, especially from the Special Forces, is that they would never fire upon their own people, and they support the Second Amendment.
[01:53:42.431 --> 01:53:45.093]  And Barack Obama is illegitimate in their eyes.
[01:53:45.353 --> 01:53:53.978]  Well, that's why they're trying to recruit foreigners, and the biggest recruiting stations are in Manila, and in Eastern Europe, and in Mexico City.
[01:53:54.458 --> 01:53:56.099]  Do you think that that's going to get their game?
[01:53:56.139 --> 01:53:57.100]  Because here's the deal.
[01:53:57.836 --> 01:53:59.136]  Here, here, let's go back to the full audience.
[01:53:59.316 --> 01:54:00.277]  Let's go back to the full audience.
[01:54:00.297 --> 01:54:00.597]  Here we go.
[01:54:03.497 --> 01:54:05.358]  Alright, we're talking to Michael in Idaho.
[01:54:05.378 --> 01:54:07.858]  I may have to go into overdrive here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:10.079 --> 01:54:11.319]  I may have to continue the transmission.
[01:54:12.399 --> 01:54:13.919]  Let's just do five minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:13.939 --> 01:54:15.180]  Alright, is that cool?
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:20.001]  Because I've got to go to a meeting in a minute.
[01:54:20.461 --> 01:54:22.601]  Michael in Idaho is an armorer.
[01:54:23.221 --> 01:54:24.682]  I've got some family, one of them's an armorer.
[01:54:25.282 --> 01:54:26.402]  But, talking to folks.
[01:54:27.543 --> 01:54:33.629]  And he's saying the special forces are saying they know it's New World Order, they know it's illegitimate, they're not going after the American people.
[01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:41.376]  And I mentioned that's why the biggest army recruiting centers are in Mexico City, Manila, Philippines, and in Eastern Europe, places like Ukraine.
[01:54:41.396 --> 01:54:44.879]  I mean, they really are bringing in foreign troops, but in the military itself.
[01:54:45.319 --> 01:54:47.982]  And I saw a mainstream news article today, I never got to,
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:59.844]  This is out of the Army Times, 2008 Army Times poll, wary about Obama, and it says the troops don't like Obama and don't trust him.
[01:55:00.084 --> 01:55:01.685]  So that just seconds what you were just saying.
[01:55:01.705 --> 01:55:02.465]  Go ahead and finish up.
[01:55:03.586 --> 01:55:05.187]  There is one thing I'd like to mention.
[01:55:05.227 --> 01:55:17.912]  When Ron Paul was running, when they had the massive donations and stuff around this time last year, they cut off their communications so they could not use their credit cards.
[01:55:18.482 --> 01:55:19.225]  And they were ticked.
[01:55:19.285 --> 01:55:24.624]  They were putting Ron Paul all over their tanks and everything else in disrespect to their superiors.
[01:55:25.137 --> 01:55:25.437]  Good.
[01:55:25.837 --> 01:55:27.158]  That was going on all over the place.
[01:55:27.178 --> 01:55:31.299]  Because their superiors, their superiors are bought and paid for by the New World Order.
[01:55:31.539 --> 01:55:32.680]  This is not our government.
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:37.041]  These are illegitimate foreign corporate raiders that have seized control of the executive.
[01:55:37.342 --> 01:55:45.985]  Are the special forces, I know a lot of them are, I'm asking you, aware that martial law has been declared over Congress and the War Powers Act has been implemented?
[01:55:46.465 --> 01:55:47.125]  Yes, they are.
[01:55:47.165 --> 01:55:52.767]  And one of the things that they have to keep their mouth kind of quiet, and it's internal infiltration.
[01:55:53.207 --> 01:55:54.248]  They're telling them what they want to
[01:55:54.730 --> 01:55:55.151]  We're good to go.
[01:56:09.784 --> 01:56:10.304]  I can tell you that.
[01:56:10.324 --> 01:56:28.615]  Well, that's why they're going to fully implode the economy, where the rioting and starving gets so bad, that then, you know, I'll be at home with rioters wishing the army was there, then the army comes in, does a good job, and sets the precedent that army can be on the streets, then the real tyranny begins.
[01:56:28.655 --> 01:56:29.476]  Do they understand that?
[01:56:30.076 --> 01:56:33.398]  Well, they do understand that, but you know, they also understand this game.
[01:56:33.858 --> 01:56:35.479]  Look, I'm a vet of the Cold War.
[01:56:35.519 --> 01:56:38.441]  I was out in South America, and I watched the same game go on.
[01:56:39.341 --> 01:56:44.262]  Okay, and a lot of these other guys that are old or salt know what's going on.
[01:56:44.882 --> 01:56:47.622]  And they're not going to get to that point, I don't think.
[01:56:48.163 --> 01:56:49.743]  They're going to do something stupid.
[01:56:50.943 --> 01:56:51.303]  Okay?
[01:56:51.623 --> 01:56:54.144]  And it's just a waiting game, as I see it.
[01:56:55.304 --> 01:57:05.225]  The only thing that I hear is that a lot of the guys feel really...cracking beers open, and we're sitting around talking, and they feel a little... I don't know how to say it.
[01:57:05.405 --> 01:57:08.406]  They feel a little disappointed in the American people, thinking that
[01:57:08.976 --> 01:57:11.657]  They would ever do those kind of things to the system bodies.
[01:57:12.757 --> 01:57:14.337]  Well, because the police are different.
[01:57:14.377 --> 01:57:17.678]  The police have been trained in amongst us so long.
[01:57:18.278 --> 01:57:19.179]  Wait a minute on that.
[01:57:19.199 --> 01:57:20.739]  I know a lot of police officers.
[01:57:21.299 --> 01:57:23.940]  Now, you've got a lot of police officers playing the same game.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:25.880]  Now, every area is different.
[01:57:26.481 --> 01:57:29.441]  If I was in Atlanta, Georgia, they're done.
[01:57:29.942 --> 01:57:35.403]  But areas like here in Idaho and other places in Arizona and even in your area, there's good cops.
[01:57:36.112 --> 01:57:37.053]  They're watching and waiting.
[01:57:37.194 --> 01:57:38.976]  I know that, but the leadership's evil.
[01:57:38.996 --> 01:57:39.917]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:40.678 --> 01:57:44.804]  Robert Wonick, will you do T-minus eight minutes?
[01:57:44.824 --> 01:57:46.406]  We'll go eight minutes into the next hour and that's it.
[01:57:46.446 --> 01:57:48.388]  That way we can join the rebroadcast.
[01:57:48.408 --> 01:57:49.610]  We covered a lot of key info today.
[01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:50.832]  Robert, you'll do that with us?
[01:57:51.658 --> 01:57:51.878]  Yeah.
[01:57:52.478 --> 01:57:52.719]  Okay.
[01:57:53.279 --> 01:57:56.300]  We're gonna go eight minutes into the next hour.
[01:57:58.001 --> 01:58:00.062]  James and Mason and people hung up.
[01:58:00.523 --> 01:58:01.283]  Give me the number.
[01:58:01.343 --> 01:58:10.548]  Give me the toll-free number for folks to call in on our phone system so James and Mason and Melody and Bob and Les can get in.
[01:58:11.624 --> 01:58:15.285]  Okay, we're going to give you this number real fast here, right at the end, so you can call in.
[01:58:15.845 --> 01:58:18.385]  Rebroadcast will start after we're done with the overdrive.
[01:58:18.405 --> 01:58:21.966]  We're still going to be live when this ends, only on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:21.986 --> 01:58:24.066]  I'll be back live on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:24.546 --> 01:58:29.947]  Please support us financially by buying the books and videos at InfoWars.com, plus they're waking people up.
[01:58:30.847 --> 01:58:35.868]  And I'll give you the phone number to call as the transmission ends.
[01:58:36.008 --> 01:58:36.468]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.809 --> 01:58:39.969]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:41.311 --> 01:58:43.652]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:43.672 --> 01:58:52.955]  I'm going to just go ahead and do five minutes here.
[01:58:52.995 --> 01:58:54.516]  I don't even know if they can punch this up.
[01:58:55.576 --> 01:58:56.437]  With Robert Wannick.
[01:58:56.457 --> 01:58:59.198]  I'm going to go ahead and finish up with Robert and take a few final calls right now, okay?
[01:58:59.618 --> 01:59:03.419]  Well, they've got to dial up the next show, Catherine.
[01:59:03.439 --> 01:59:05.560]  Okay.
[01:59:07.701 --> 01:59:09.462]  I did this kind of last minute here.
[01:59:12.037 --> 01:59:14.177]  I didn't have a chance to get his mailing address.
[01:59:14.197 --> 01:59:20.079]  Okay, well I'm going to put you on hold right now, and then we're going to call Robert Warnick back right now ourselves.
[01:59:20.719 --> 01:59:22.760]  I am his number to my control room.
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:23.760]  Okay, I'll do that right now.
[01:59:23.921 --> 01:59:24.761]  And then get his phone number.
[01:59:24.801 --> 01:59:25.001]  Thank you.
[01:59:26.616 --> 01:59:27.377]  Oh, it never ends.
[01:59:27.757 --> 01:59:32.120]  You guys got to be ready to jump to retransmission after I finish up with this.
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:33.701]  This is crazy TV, folks.
[01:59:33.721 --> 01:59:40.465]  We can basically do it however we want here, but I got stuck with that longer phone call dealing with the troops and the military.
[01:59:40.765 --> 01:59:41.986]  This isn't a drill or a game.
[01:59:42.126 --> 01:59:48.590]  Most countries get taken over by their militaries and police, being controlled by a corrupt group, generally offshore corporations.
[01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:52.933]  Offshore corporations come in, they buy off governments, they get control, they loot the nations.
[01:59:54.239 --> 01:59:56.542]  And that is happening again right now.
[01:59:57.403 --> 02:00:04.591]  So let me give everybody listening on the internet, and specifically Les, Bob, a lot of them are probably listening on AMNFM so they can't, Mason, Melody,
[02:00:06.038 --> 02:00:11.722]  We're going to give you that number that's up on screen.
[02:00:11.762 --> 02:00:12.503]  It's 888-201-2244.
[02:00:12.523 --> 02:00:13.043]  888-201-2244.
[02:00:13.624 --> 02:00:18.347]  Because the majority of people aren't PrisonPlanet.tv members, they can't see that number on screen.
[02:00:18.888 --> 02:00:21.029]  So, 888-201-2244.
[02:00:21.049 --> 02:00:21.390]  888-201-2244.
[02:00:22.410 --> 02:00:26.153]  And I'll take three or four of those calls that we're patiently holding.
[02:00:26.193 --> 02:00:29.056]  And I've got a meeting I've got to be to at, let me see, I think it's 3.30.
[02:00:29.096 --> 02:00:31.277]  That's about 20 minutes away.
[02:00:31.317 --> 02:00:31.778]  Let me look.
[02:00:32.674 --> 02:00:34.134]  A little card here for the meeting.
[02:00:34.634 --> 02:00:36.455]  We're also interviewing a bunch of folks here.
[02:00:37.875 --> 02:00:40.396]  Oh my goodness, what time is that?
[02:00:42.056 --> 02:00:44.637]  Oh, the meeting is at four o'clock.
[02:00:45.937 --> 02:00:49.858]  Looks like retransmission will be going a little bit longer than I thought today.
[02:00:52.659 --> 02:00:53.359]  Oh my goodness.
[02:00:55.259 --> 02:00:59.801]  We'll get Robert Wannick here on the line because I want to give him a good send-off and say bye to him.
[02:00:59.881 --> 02:01:00.961]  Okay, well let's go ahead and bring him
[02:01:02.841 --> 02:01:03.701]  Well, you just told me you had him.
[02:01:03.821 --> 02:01:04.902]  Okay.
[02:01:05.022 --> 02:01:07.703]  Robert Wannick, it is good to have you back on with us.
[02:01:11.884 --> 02:01:13.945]  What did you think of that interview we just did?
[02:01:13.985 --> 02:01:14.485]  Pretty wild.
[02:01:14.505 --> 02:01:16.226]  I thought it was pretty good.
[02:01:16.246 --> 02:01:17.246]  It went pretty good.
[02:01:18.187 --> 02:01:22.448]  Before I take a few final calls here with you, anything else you wanted to add?
[02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:23.949]  Any other points you didn't have a chance to make?
[02:01:24.769 --> 02:01:27.750]  Well, just like on the part where you're saying they're going to make their
[02:01:28.308 --> 02:01:31.812]  They're final stupid move and then people are going to retaliate.
[02:01:32.332 --> 02:01:34.475]  That might be a little too late for the Last Caller.
[02:01:34.835 --> 02:01:39.900]  That's why we need to educate the fellow man now with Terror Storm and all these other DVDs.
[02:01:40.421 --> 02:01:44.385]  That way, when Barack Obama comes for our guns, he's not taking them.
[02:01:45.251 --> 02:01:47.392]  And we can't wait for them to make that final move.
[02:01:47.592 --> 02:01:50.513]  Everybody needs to be awake, and we need to get them awake now.
[02:01:50.893 --> 02:01:54.215]  Well, everybody knows it's an illegitimate foreign banker government.
[02:01:54.235 --> 02:01:55.935]  They now admit it's world government.
[02:01:56.376 --> 02:01:57.296]  We run the banks.
[02:01:57.556 --> 02:02:01.037]  We're going to create a new global currency where each of your currencies is controlled by us.
[02:02:01.338 --> 02:02:02.858]  You'll pay carbon taxes to us.
[02:02:03.739 --> 02:02:07.300]  And I mean, I just can't believe this is really happening.
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:09.141]  And so many government people
[02:02:10.361 --> 02:02:14.124]  And you know that caller was saying that most of the cops and military are going to stand with us.
[02:02:14.584 --> 02:02:16.125]  Let's see what happens under peer pressure.
[02:02:16.726 --> 02:02:19.368]  Let's see what happens when the crisis is so bad it's been engineered.
[02:02:19.768 --> 02:02:22.270]  I mean, I've heard the troops wouldn't confiscate guns.
[02:02:22.290 --> 02:02:23.170]  They did in New Orleans.
[02:02:23.771 --> 02:02:29.775]  The State Guard, now federalized, National Guard in Illinois is doing it with that Blagojevich criminal running them.
[02:02:30.816 --> 02:02:31.296]  You've got
[02:02:32.884 --> 02:02:37.345]  All these FBI training manuals saying the new order doesn't exist and we're crazy and need to be arrested.
[02:02:37.785 --> 02:02:40.986]  Now, I know most of them don't like what's happening, but they still follow the orders.
[02:02:42.666 --> 02:02:43.626]  They're pretty compliant.
[02:02:44.706 --> 02:02:45.666]  No, they're superiors.
[02:02:45.706 --> 02:02:47.227]  They've just been conditioned for it.
[02:02:50.027 --> 02:02:50.607]  Absolutely.
[02:02:50.687 --> 02:02:51.588]  Let's take a call for you.
[02:02:51.628 --> 02:02:53.248]  Mason in Minnesota.
[02:02:53.268 --> 02:02:54.108]  You're on the air, Mason.
[02:02:55.008 --> 02:02:55.468]  Oh, hey Alex.
[02:02:57.089 --> 02:02:57.489]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:03:00.071 --> 02:03:05.352]  I'm one of Robert's best friends in town here.
[02:03:06.732 --> 02:03:09.113]  Try this, try turning your radio off and listening to me.
[02:03:11.653 --> 02:03:12.133]  Alright, got it.
[02:03:12.153 --> 02:03:16.374]  Because if you try to talk to me and listen to the delay on the internet, you're not going to do a very good job.
[02:03:16.934 --> 02:03:17.374]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:17.994 --> 02:03:18.534]  How old are you?
[02:03:18.574 --> 02:03:19.074]  What's your name?
[02:03:20.015 --> 02:03:20.275]  I am 17.
[02:03:20.435 --> 02:03:22.255]  My name is Mason Gask.
[02:03:24.435 --> 02:03:25.796]  I live in the same town as Robert.
[02:03:30.077 --> 02:03:31.558]  Well good, do you have any points you'd like to make?
[02:03:32.979 --> 02:03:33.559]  Uh, excuse me?
[02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:36.161]  Is there anything you'd like to say?
[02:03:36.181 --> 02:03:37.302]  Uh, yeah.
[02:03:38.042 --> 02:03:44.687]  I think what Robert... I think he's calling on Skype, which is a bad line.
[02:03:45.788 --> 02:03:47.349]  I think he's probably on his cell phone.
[02:03:47.829 --> 02:03:49.430]  Yeah, let's talk to Ron in Wisconsin.
[02:03:49.770 --> 02:03:51.631]  Ron in Wisconsin, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:03:52.132 --> 02:03:59.417]  Hi Alex, I'd like to help out with donating $25 to support your giving away those videos.
[02:04:00.489 --> 02:04:01.529]  Well, thank you.
[02:04:01.569 --> 02:04:03.090]  Quite frankly, we're a little freaked out.
[02:04:03.130 --> 02:04:17.613]  We tried to save money and tried to be good stewards so we could operate even in lean times, but the economy is shutting down so fast, and we've expanded, that if people think this is important work they're hearing and seeing, we need financial contributions.
[02:04:17.633 --> 02:04:24.315]  And what I like is the financial contribution of people buying books and videos, because then you know you're getting something for it.
[02:04:24.395 --> 02:04:25.915]  You know it's a tool to wake people up.
[02:04:26.555 --> 02:04:28.456]  But if folks want to give us just straight-up donations,
[02:04:29.396 --> 02:04:36.882]  You know, there's an address at Infowars.com and people can write to us at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:04:36.922 --> 02:04:45.548]  They can call toll-free, you know, buy some of the books and videos, and then we'll be able to operate and continue our operations here.
[02:04:45.989 --> 02:04:47.450]  Yeah, I support you.
[02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:55.536]  I subscribed to your radio show on the internet, and I also gave you a hundred bucks on the Infowar bomb.
[02:04:55.905 --> 02:04:56.486]  That was awesome.
[02:04:56.506 --> 02:05:00.469]  That's how we did this and that's how we moved into better offices so we could hire more people.
[02:05:00.949 --> 02:05:03.932]  And now we've just got to try to make the money so we can keep people employed here.
[02:05:04.813 --> 02:05:06.734]  But we're very effective.
[02:05:07.555 --> 02:05:08.356]  Bang for the buck.
[02:05:08.696 --> 02:05:13.921]  What we're doing against the New World Order and the PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers, all of you, you make it possible.
[02:05:14.441 --> 02:05:17.604]  Yeah, I think your TV show on the internet is just awesome.
[02:05:18.663 --> 02:05:19.083]  Well, thank you.
[02:05:19.103 --> 02:05:23.965]  We're also developing it for regular TV, but that'll take funds as well, so thank you, sir.
[02:05:24.285 --> 02:05:25.405]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:05:25.425 --> 02:05:30.767]  No, I'd like you to put me into one of your guys' offline so I can give them a credit card number.
[02:05:31.847 --> 02:05:32.648]  Okay, let me do this.
[02:05:32.668 --> 02:05:40.410]  Will you go to Tim and get his extension, because we just moved and all our extensions just changed, so I can on-air... I can't hear you.
[02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:42.011]  Okay, okay.
[02:05:42.411 --> 02:05:42.951]  It's kind of crazy.
[02:05:42.971 --> 02:05:44.692]  People are talking to me through the glass and they're not talking to me.
[02:05:46.551 --> 02:05:52.673]  And give me an extension for folks that want to call and make a donation to the operation.
[02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:55.254]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[02:05:55.334 --> 02:05:57.694]  I'll give that phone number and extension out.
[02:05:57.714 --> 02:06:07.737]  I mean, I know our number here at the office, but we moved three weeks ago fully and I still don't know if all the extensions are programmed or all of that is ready because it's been in some disarray.
[02:06:08.137 --> 02:06:13.679]  So you're such a small operation and you're moving and doing all your regular work while you're at it and trying to hire more people.
[02:06:14.819 --> 02:06:19.721]  It creates quite a cauldron of confusion.
[02:06:20.721 --> 02:06:21.922]  But we will do that.
[02:06:22.322 --> 02:06:24.883]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in California.
[02:06:25.143 --> 02:06:26.183]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:06:26.203 --> 02:06:26.783]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:06:27.684 --> 02:06:28.044]  Hi, Bob.
[02:06:28.084 --> 02:06:29.144]  How are you guys doing?
[02:06:30.204 --> 02:06:31.425]  I'm from California.
[02:06:31.565 --> 02:06:33.726]  I'm a retired Air Force vet.
[02:06:34.986 --> 02:06:37.327]  I also work at a base in California.
[02:06:38.307 --> 02:06:41.168]  And I'm going to try to start a group.
[02:06:41.828 --> 02:06:43.469]  I live in the high desert in California.
[02:06:44.577 --> 02:06:49.559]  And I'm going to try to start my own Patreon group and doing some research on how to start it.
[02:06:50.999 --> 02:07:11.706]  Anyways, I go to church and I know back in around 2000 they passed, the Supreme Court passed, where you can have a religious group after school and they have what is called the Good News Club and our church supports a couple of schools where they go to schools and they talk to kids
[02:07:12.313 --> 02:07:14.675]  About the Bible and about Jesus and all that.
[02:07:15.035 --> 02:07:18.819]  So I don't know why he cannot start a group after school.
[02:07:20.961 --> 02:07:32.711]  What you mentioned to him, you know, people that are like-minded like him that are against 9-11, what happened, and against the government for covering up all this stuff.
[02:07:33.712 --> 02:07:35.573]  I know that he could start a group.
[02:07:36.154 --> 02:07:36.434]  Yeah.
[02:07:37.685 --> 02:07:39.346]  As you see, there are more like-minded people.
[02:07:39.386 --> 02:07:40.687]  We just had a student call in.
[02:07:40.928 --> 02:07:42.469]  One of my better friends from my town.
[02:07:42.489 --> 02:07:44.150]  I don't know if he had bad reception.
[02:07:44.711 --> 02:07:46.132]  But we had a student come in.
[02:07:46.192 --> 02:07:47.573]  He's a junior at the school.
[02:07:47.853 --> 02:07:48.574]  He's involved.
[02:07:49.094 --> 02:07:56.160]  And when we get this new film about activism, we're gonna be hanging flyers up on the new class system that the students vigorously oppose.
[02:07:56.900 --> 02:07:57.781]  And he'll be in that.
[02:07:57.821 --> 02:07:59.723]  There'll be more students that you'll see in that.
[02:07:59.823 --> 02:08:02.665]  And you'll just be introduced to a whole flurry of educated youth.
[02:08:03.326 --> 02:08:06.108]  And you'll really be surprised at how educated people are at my school.
[02:08:06.844 --> 02:08:09.586]  And how excited they are for change, and they really want to affect it.
[02:08:09.866 --> 02:08:11.006]  And we're not just going to sit back.
[02:08:11.066 --> 02:08:14.228]  It's good calling into shows, and it's awesome what you're doing, starting a Patreon group.
[02:08:14.588 --> 02:08:15.529]  That's exactly what you're doing.
[02:08:15.549 --> 02:08:17.990]  You need to take the next step and start that group and get out there.
[02:08:18.010 --> 02:08:18.891]  So, I really appreciate you doing that.
[02:08:18.911 --> 02:08:19.491]  Absolutely.
[02:08:19.531 --> 02:08:20.391]  Good to hear from you.
[02:08:20.491 --> 02:08:26.235]  As long as they don't, as long as you don't have a teacher involved, it has to be student involved only.
[02:08:26.935 --> 02:08:27.195]  Yeah.
[02:08:28.036 --> 02:08:29.336]  Oh no, these teachers don't want to get involved.
[02:08:29.356 --> 02:08:33.398]  They don't want to, they don't want to step in front of anybody that's searching for a group.
[02:08:33.418 --> 02:08:36.100]  As long as you have a group, it has to be led by the students.
[02:08:37.492 --> 02:08:39.214]  Hey, how's it going, guys?
[02:08:39.234 --> 02:08:42.196]  Robert, let me just first and foremost say, you're an inspiration, man.
[02:08:42.216 --> 02:08:44.659]  I'm 24 years old, and I think back when I was in high school, I just wish I could
[02:09:04.693 --> 02:09:10.138]  Now, our young people need real purpose in fighting the globalists who are destroying our country, destroying our Bill of Rights.
[02:09:10.478 --> 02:09:11.499]  I mean, this is the calling.
[02:09:11.559 --> 02:09:12.600]  Be part of history now.
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:24.228]  And young people, take a camera to school, be polite, hand out 9-11 truth DVDs, hand out bumper stickers, hand out materials, and when they try to stop you doing that, put that on YouTube, put that on LiveLink, put that on BlipTV.
[02:09:24.969 --> 02:09:26.190]  Put that out on MySpace.
[02:09:26.450 --> 02:09:26.871]  All of us.
[02:09:26.931 --> 02:09:29.513]  Imagine millions of young people taking action.
[02:09:29.833 --> 02:09:30.613]  Nothing will stop it.
[02:09:30.633 --> 02:09:32.315]  That's why Obama wants the Youth Corps.
[02:09:32.635 --> 02:09:36.658]  They want to control the youth with their communist, socialist, fascist command and control.
[02:09:37.018 --> 02:09:40.441]  We have to have an organic, true grassroots resistance to them.
[02:09:40.501 --> 02:09:41.902]  And it's out there and it's going on.
[02:09:42.243 --> 02:09:43.083]  And this is the key.
[02:09:43.664 --> 02:09:47.807]  Alex, can I just tell you a real quick story about what I experienced in high school?
[02:09:48.867 --> 02:09:52.289]  Basically, arm him for what he may incur in the future.
[02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:53.650]  Sure, can we boost his audio?
[02:09:53.670 --> 02:09:54.830]  Because I'm having trouble hearing the caller.
[02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:55.150]  Go ahead.
[02:09:55.631 --> 02:09:56.171]  Sure, I'm sorry.
[02:09:56.211 --> 02:09:57.392]  Let me get close to my phone.
[02:09:57.672 --> 02:10:01.534]  When I was in high school, I had a little altercation.
[02:10:02.374 --> 02:10:07.277]  It was right after Columbine, and just to give you a little background, I'm a pretty bombastic person.
[02:10:07.297 --> 02:10:07.977]  I speak my mind.
[02:10:08.017 --> 02:10:08.517]  You know what I mean?
[02:10:08.997 --> 02:10:11.339]  And I used to always give the faculty a hard time.
[02:10:11.379 --> 02:10:16.021]  I mean, when I was in high school, they had just implemented that ID program that you were just talking about.
[02:10:16.886 --> 02:10:20.829]  And, you know, that was a big cause for consternation, and I said, you know, go on and on about it.
[02:10:20.849 --> 02:10:27.294]  You know, he pleased to go, the lady's crazy, you know, he's going to shoot up the school and whatnot, you know, because it was right during that Columbine time.
[02:10:27.535 --> 02:10:28.115]  That's what they do.
[02:10:28.155 --> 02:10:37.823]  Anybody who doesn't like the police state wants to... That's what Biden said in that clip I played, where a guy said, please don't take my guns, and Biden said, oh my God, your guns need to be confiscated, don't come shoot me.
[02:10:38.343 --> 02:10:46.470]  Yeah, and the faculty of the school seized on this as if it was like an opportunity to bring me into the office, to the general protective involved,
[02:10:48.088 --> 02:10:52.492]  And it was totally, it was totally ridiculous, like cartoonish.
[02:10:53.633 --> 02:11:04.923]  Sir, every week I see about some high school student in English writes a story about their dad is in the Marines or writes a story about zombies attacking a fictitious school.
[02:11:05.264 --> 02:11:06.385]  I wrote a story about zombies.
[02:11:06.405 --> 02:11:06.965]  I'll never forget that.
[02:11:06.985 --> 02:11:07.666]  I got an A on.
[02:11:07.686 --> 02:11:09.067]  You know, that was 20 years ago.
[02:11:12.128 --> 02:11:16.950]  And they now come and arrest you for that and say it's a murder plot.
[02:11:17.251 --> 02:11:18.411]  Again, for what you write.
[02:11:18.511 --> 02:11:21.833]  The students are being taught there's no First Amendment even in the articles they write.
[02:11:22.093 --> 02:11:24.414]  Even articles that don't mention the school, don't mention any students.
[02:11:25.975 --> 02:11:33.039]  The last guy that got arrested that I read about and charged with attempted murder, he wrote a story about a fictitious school with zombies.
[02:11:33.119 --> 02:11:34.819]  He was a straight-A student.
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:37.701]  And they said, write a fiction story.
[02:11:37.961 --> 02:11:39.182]  So he wrote a story about zombies.
[02:11:39.622 --> 02:11:41.443]  And his grandparents said, oh, let me see your paper.
[02:11:42.324 --> 02:11:46.668]  They read it, and they went and called 911 and reported he's got a story about zombies.
[02:11:47.088 --> 02:11:48.249]  And they said, that's it, you're arrested.
[02:11:50.231 --> 02:11:54.674]  In fact, Google, people aren't going to believe this, Google for me real fast guys, you can find this one.
[02:11:55.735 --> 02:11:59.418]  Google, student arrested for writing zombie story.
[02:11:59.999 --> 02:12:03.782]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:12:04.182 --> 02:12:05.623]  Go ahead, Michael, you wanted to say something.
[02:12:06.084 --> 02:12:11.288]  I'm sorry, if he finds himself in one of these types of situations, one word of advice I can give him is,
[02:12:11.917 --> 02:12:13.918]  Temper your reason.
[02:12:14.339 --> 02:12:15.279]  Do not flip out.
[02:12:15.459 --> 02:12:22.704]  If you put forward a unified and coherent thesis opposing what they're trying to say to you, they'll have nothing.
[02:12:22.824 --> 02:12:24.646]  And also, they'll be proud of it.
[02:12:24.686 --> 02:12:26.767]  Like Alex says, you know, these people are compartmentalized.
[02:12:26.787 --> 02:12:28.308]  They don't even really realize what they're doing.
[02:12:28.648 --> 02:12:36.954]  So if you show them that you're intelligent, and you know what you're saying, you will be able to combat the propaganda that the staff is under.
[02:12:37.034 --> 02:12:41.237]  Yeah, but we will definitely not give in to their instigation with violence or anything.
[02:12:41.608 --> 02:12:44.888]  Because we see that these situations that they instigate...
[02:12:45.359 --> 02:12:46.800]  They cause our fraudulent.
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:48.981]  That's why we stay calm about it.
[02:12:49.021 --> 02:12:50.242]  We haven't done anything wrong.
[02:12:50.563 --> 02:12:51.303]  We stay calm.
[02:12:51.703 --> 02:12:52.624]  And that's how patriots do it.
[02:12:52.664 --> 02:12:53.484]  We do it peacefully.
[02:12:53.825 --> 02:12:55.946]  I wish I knew what you knew when I was your age.
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:21.423]  Goose Creek, North Carolina, where they have all the kids line up every morning with police dogs even biting their bags.
[02:13:21.723 --> 02:13:22.944]  Remember that a few years ago on the news?
[02:13:23.204 --> 02:13:24.785]  Where the police dogs were biting the bags?
[02:13:25.906 --> 02:13:26.527]  Oh, don't believe me?
[02:13:26.547 --> 02:13:29.108]  Before we end the show, did you find the zombie article?
[02:13:30.029 --> 02:13:31.270]  Did you find the zombie article?
[02:13:32.984 --> 02:13:34.226]  Oh, the zombie article is up.
[02:13:34.726 --> 02:13:36.689]  Yeah, a student arrested for writing zombie.
[02:13:37.029 --> 02:13:40.694]  Yeah, yeah, click on the current.com mainstream news article.
[02:13:41.014 --> 02:13:41.415]  Here it is.
[02:13:41.455 --> 02:13:42.176]  Now, there's another one.
[02:13:42.917 --> 02:13:45.580]  Google Goose Creek, North Carolina.
[02:13:45.901 --> 02:13:46.622]  Go to YouTube.
[02:13:47.062 --> 02:13:48.865]  This was pre-YouTube, but it should be on there now.
[02:13:50.831 --> 02:13:51.692]  Yeah, go ahead and put this up.
[02:13:51.832 --> 02:13:53.333]  Student arrested for writing a zombie story.
[02:13:53.934 --> 02:13:54.254]  Okay.
[02:13:54.815 --> 02:13:55.716]  A fictitious school.
[02:13:56.116 --> 02:13:56.797]  English class.
[02:13:57.197 --> 02:13:59.740]  Story about zombies attacking a fictitious school.
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:02.182]  Folks, I got an A+.
[02:14:02.242 --> 02:14:02.883]  I'll never forget.
[02:14:03.603 --> 02:14:06.767]  In the 8th grade, in my English class,
[02:14:09.259 --> 02:14:14.123]  Where me and my buddy, my black football buddy, Corey Strange, are in a pickup truck.
[02:14:14.163 --> 02:14:14.883]  We're 16.
[02:14:15.384 --> 02:14:20.888]  Zombies attack the Rockwall School and we run home and get shotguns and defeat the zombies.
[02:14:21.368 --> 02:14:22.649]  This story was basically the same.
[02:14:22.689 --> 02:14:23.690]  Now, I got an A+.
[02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.711]  I don't know.
[02:14:25.912 --> 02:14:27.453]  I was 12 years old.
[02:14:28.434 --> 02:14:29.114]  How many years ago?
[02:14:29.154 --> 02:14:29.534]  I'm 34.
[02:14:30.655 --> 02:14:31.516]  Like 20 years ago.
[02:14:32.056 --> 02:14:32.316]  Let me see.
[02:14:33.959 --> 02:14:37.782]  That's 22 years ago.
[02:14:37.822 --> 02:14:38.422]  I'm getting old.
[02:14:40.223 --> 02:14:42.405]  Back then I got an A-plus for writing a story like this.
[02:14:43.205 --> 02:14:44.586]  Now you get arrested.
[02:14:45.707 --> 02:14:46.367]  That's not enough.
[02:14:46.748 --> 02:14:49.089]  I'm going to document it for everybody.
[02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:54.333]  Did you ever find the one about them telling the kids they're about to be killed and the kids thought it was real and they throw fake blood on them?
[02:14:55.336 --> 02:14:56.457]  You didn't find that one out of Michigan?
[02:14:56.777 --> 02:14:57.558]  Okay, well, whatever.
[02:14:57.578 --> 02:14:57.898]  It's there.
[02:14:57.918 --> 02:14:58.558]  It was all over the news.
[02:14:59.039 --> 02:15:08.886]  The point is, is that we need to pull up Goose Creek, North Carolina school drug raid.
[02:15:09.767 --> 02:15:13.189]  And they have the children line up every day until the video got released from the school.
[02:15:13.349 --> 02:15:14.850]  Somebody smuggled it out, one of the teachers.
[02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:16.852]  There's good folks inside, inside the camp.
[02:15:17.833 --> 02:15:21.374]  And the children cry every day, and the dogs come in and bite their bags, and they cry.
[02:15:22.254 --> 02:15:26.215]  And then marijuana's never even found, and the cops just walk around with their guns.
[02:15:26.615 --> 02:15:28.436]  Just total destruction of America.
[02:15:28.916 --> 02:15:30.496]  Meanwhile, they ship in the drugs themselves.
[02:15:30.516 --> 02:15:31.237]  Their bosses do.
[02:15:31.957 --> 02:15:33.517]  Oh, Goose Creek South Carolina School, right.
[02:15:34.697 --> 02:15:37.078]  Let's go to More on there.
[02:15:37.158 --> 02:15:38.118]  Click Video.
[02:15:38.719 --> 02:15:39.879]  And that will pull it up for us.
[02:15:39.899 --> 02:15:40.579]  No, no, no.
[02:15:40.599 --> 02:15:41.359]  Take me back to the screen.
[02:15:41.859 --> 02:15:42.239]  Here, here.
[02:15:42.419 --> 02:15:43.240]  Punch me up over here.
[02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:44.140]  Then I'll go back to your calls.
[02:15:45.672 --> 02:15:45.892]  Okay.
[02:15:46.392 --> 02:15:46.933]  Go to the top.
[02:15:47.173 --> 02:15:48.435]  Goose Creek, South Carolina.
[02:15:49.316 --> 02:15:49.776]  Go to the top.
[02:15:50.317 --> 02:15:52.179]  Okay, now go over here where it says More.
[02:15:54.761 --> 02:15:55.502]  Cut to the wide shot.
[02:15:55.522 --> 02:15:55.983]  I'll show you.
[02:15:57.064 --> 02:15:58.305]  I'll physically show you.
[02:15:58.626 --> 02:16:01.509]  If you cut to the wide shot, I will physically show the control guys.
[02:16:01.809 --> 02:16:03.771]  I'm basically training them on what I do.
[02:16:03.811 --> 02:16:04.452]  This is not hard.
[02:16:04.632 --> 02:16:05.253]  They're smart guys.
[02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:09.771]  Let me have control of the internet.
[02:16:10.171 --> 02:16:10.631]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:10.671 --> 02:16:11.171]  See right here?
[02:16:11.471 --> 02:16:11.912]  Exactly.
[02:16:11.992 --> 02:16:13.452]  Now I want to show everybody on screen.
[02:16:13.472 --> 02:16:14.653]  This is very easy.
[02:16:14.893 --> 02:16:16.414]  But I tell adults this and they don't know how.
[02:16:16.434 --> 02:16:17.774]  I tell my parents this and they don't know how.
[02:16:18.255 --> 02:16:18.935]  It's so simple.
[02:16:19.175 --> 02:16:20.015]  Look, you're on Google.
[02:16:20.175 --> 02:16:23.337]  You click on More with Goose Creek, North Carolina drug raid.
[02:16:23.497 --> 02:16:24.297]  You click Video.
[02:16:24.397 --> 02:16:26.218]  See where it says Video right there at the very top of the screen.
[02:16:26.598 --> 02:16:26.779]  Good.
[02:16:26.819 --> 02:16:27.199]  Click that.
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:29.520]  Okay.
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:30.881]  There we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:33.822 --> 02:16:35.643]  Uh... For some reason it's not pulling it up.
[02:16:36.984 --> 02:16:40.166]  Okay, go back to the main page, because this happened four or five years ago.
[02:16:40.587 --> 02:16:41.607]  It's not in the main index now.
[02:16:41.627 --> 02:16:41.907]  Let me see.
[02:16:41.927 --> 02:16:44.649]  Goose Creek, fallout continues, an aftermath of high school.
[02:16:47.411 --> 02:16:49.052]  There is a couple of newspapers.
[02:16:49.572 --> 02:16:51.554]  Goose Creek, South Carolina, school raid.
[02:16:51.894 --> 02:16:55.336]  Click on the top one, because it'll probably have a video link.
[02:16:55.896 --> 02:16:56.937]  Just go ahead and click on that one.
[02:17:00.279 --> 02:17:01.460]  Yeah, the CNN one's fine, too.
[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:02.641]  Go down to the CNN one.
[02:17:03.081 --> 02:17:03.821]  This is driving me crazy.
[02:17:03.841 --> 02:17:05.102]  I've just got to take control of this myself.
[02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:09.172]  Now, they had everybody lined up.
[02:17:09.192 --> 02:17:09.813]  Oh, there's the dog.
[02:17:09.833 --> 02:17:10.634]  See the dog right there.
[02:17:10.914 --> 02:17:13.418]  But I want you to see the video, because this was a daily occurrence.
[02:17:13.438 --> 02:17:16.061]  They have the kids stand up, line up like prisoners every day.
[02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:16.862]  Everyone's guilty.
[02:17:17.202 --> 02:17:21.568]  And then the police dogs come in for fun, and the children cry, and the cops get sexual pleasure.
[02:17:21.588 --> 02:17:26.894]  It's like a satanic pressing on the nerve of power, while the dogs grab on the bags and then rip them.
[02:17:27.688 --> 02:17:30.509]  And they go down the line with the dogs biting the bags.
[02:17:30.529 --> 02:17:32.349]  But the dogs are trained for terror.
[02:17:32.610 --> 02:17:33.850]  And they say, do you have drugs?
[02:17:33.890 --> 02:17:35.911]  And they say, no, I don't use them, I don't have them.
[02:17:35.971 --> 02:17:38.932]  Okay, let's move on to the next Abu Dhaib victim.
[02:17:38.952 --> 02:17:42.973]  Oh, it's South Carolina.
[02:17:42.993 --> 02:17:43.713]  I said North Carolina.
[02:17:43.733 --> 02:17:44.393]  See, memory fails.
[02:17:44.973 --> 02:17:46.974]  Go to YouTube and enter that.
[02:17:47.614 --> 02:17:49.415]  Police raid Goose Creek.
[02:17:50.515 --> 02:17:51.156]  South Carolina.
[02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:52.977]  Go to YouTube and Google it.
[02:17:53.297 --> 02:17:56.219]  Robert Wannick, I'm sorry, I'm doing classic babble here on the show.
[02:17:56.479 --> 02:17:58.281]  The point is, everything I'm saying is documented.
[02:17:59.381 --> 02:18:01.443]  And this is terrorism, is it not, Robert Wannick?
[02:18:02.624 --> 02:18:07.387]  This is not only terrorism, psychological warfare on us.
[02:18:07.867 --> 02:18:11.210]  And it's not babble as long as we're giving out this information.
[02:18:11.250 --> 02:18:13.091]  You could talk all day and
[02:18:14.065 --> 02:18:17.327]  Because it's just such important stuff that needs to get out there.
[02:18:17.988 --> 02:18:22.431]  And when people come out and they say, you guys are disinfo, Alex Jones is disinfo, he lied.
[02:18:23.331 --> 02:18:24.772]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, just a second.
[02:18:26.273 --> 02:18:27.034]  I agree with you, stay there.
[02:18:27.294 --> 02:18:28.915]  They found it and pulled it up, live on air.
[02:18:29.215 --> 02:18:31.457]  Go back, go back to the YouTube main page.
[02:18:31.837 --> 02:18:34.499]  Let's take our lower third up, or people will say it's fake.
[02:18:35.039 --> 02:18:36.760]  They're preconditioned by enemy brainwashing.
[02:18:37.101 --> 02:18:38.101]  Everyone's been preconditioned.
[02:18:38.121 --> 02:18:39.662]  We have to break your conditioning right now.
[02:18:39.702 --> 02:18:40.243]  You can do this.
[02:18:40.403 --> 02:18:40.943]  This is real.
[02:18:40.983 --> 02:18:41.804]  This is happening everywhere.
[02:18:42.364 --> 02:18:45.185]  Okay, I can even find them throwing blood on kids as they scream and cry.
[02:18:45.585 --> 02:18:46.885]  Okay, fake blood.
[02:18:47.406 --> 02:19:00.129]  Now, go back to the main page of YouTube, and then all you type in is Goose Creek Drug Raid, South Carolina, and then the first thing that comes up is this video shot by somebody in the school.
[02:19:00.189 --> 02:19:02.770]  The footage I've seen is from up from the cameras in the school themselves.
[02:19:03.010 --> 02:19:03.370]  Here it is.
[02:19:03.430 --> 02:19:03.870]  Punch it up.
[02:19:04.811 --> 02:19:05.511]  On your screen now.
[02:19:08.699 --> 02:19:09.380]  We're good to go.
[02:19:35.947 --> 02:19:37.028]  All right, that's not the one.
[02:19:37.068 --> 02:19:39.870]  The one I want is mounted up on the ceiling.
[02:19:40.931 --> 02:19:43.974]  I guess that was some subpoenaed cop video that they shot themselves.
[02:19:43.994 --> 02:19:46.256]  And they go through the whole school, and they do this every week.
[02:19:46.976 --> 02:19:56.564]  Until, you know, the people complain, and there's footage of them going, you got drugs, and the dog goes up and grabs the bag, and starts ripping, and the child's going, oh my God, oh my God, no!
[02:19:56.604 --> 02:19:57.805]  And of course, no drugs were ever found.
[02:19:58.366 --> 02:20:02.769]  So they did raid after raid for using the dogs as an Abu Ghraib torture tactic.
[02:20:03.490 --> 02:20:08.534]  Which, the army trains people in this now, in interrogation, so that's why these former army soldiers do this.
[02:20:08.974 --> 02:20:10.416]  Remember Abu Ghraib with the dogs.
[02:20:10.816 --> 02:20:12.637]  So this is Abu Ghraib in America.
[02:20:12.898 --> 02:20:18.042]  And then when this surfaced four or five years ago, all these other Abu Ghraib videos of the dogs attacking.
[02:20:18.282 --> 02:20:19.683]  Robert Wannick, go ahead and make your point.
[02:20:21.444 --> 02:20:22.685]  They're just trying to get us ready.
[02:20:23.286 --> 02:20:24.447]  Why are they doing this?
[02:20:24.927 --> 02:20:25.668]  It's conditioning.
[02:20:25.908 --> 02:20:32.053]  It's getting it drilled into your head that when these men in black come, the Gestapo come, they march down the streets with their
[02:20:34.651 --> 02:20:35.971]  Robert I lost you, please continue.
[02:20:54.847 --> 02:20:57.829]  Reduce the population, and this isn't about security.
[02:20:58.149 --> 02:21:01.270]  It's about power, control, and everything.
[02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:06.193]  The economy, the indoctrination of the schools... Oh, you heard that Marine call a few days ago.
[02:21:06.233 --> 02:21:07.113]  Did you hear the Marine call?
[02:21:07.774 --> 02:21:10.735]  Of course, I don't believe... I mean, I believe him, but only because I already know it.
[02:21:11.056 --> 02:21:19.260]  They teach the Marines in psych warfare, the higher level officer corps, learned helplessness, where they torture a puppy in an electrocution pit.
[02:21:20.134 --> 02:21:21.214]  Yeah.
[02:21:21.334 --> 02:21:25.236]  And again, they're teaching the Marines how to create learned helplessness.
[02:21:25.276 --> 02:21:26.516]  And that's what this is for the students.
[02:21:26.976 --> 02:21:33.939]  And we have government documents to train them to be helpless and to learn when they see a black uniform to just go and just submit.
[02:21:33.999 --> 02:21:39.261]  So they drill the children getting on buses, having handcuffs put on them, have dogs growl at them.
[02:21:39.301 --> 02:21:44.583]  They lock the kids up and make them defecate on themselves with no food or water locked up for eight hours.
[02:21:44.803 --> 02:21:45.843]  This is done nationwide.
[02:21:46.143 --> 02:21:47.604]  And the parents are so brainwashed
[02:21:47.884 --> 02:21:50.187]  They'll complain and the school will go, what's wrong with you?
[02:21:50.227 --> 02:21:50.967]  Are you insane?
[02:21:51.228 --> 02:21:53.931]  We have to do this to stop Columbine and Al-Qaeda attacking the schools.
[02:21:54.792 --> 02:21:58.436]  Yeah, and they want to say, don't listen to Alex Jones.
[02:21:58.576 --> 02:22:00.438]  Don't listen to these other patriot groups.
[02:22:01.058 --> 02:22:01.959]  We're not the terrorists.
[02:22:02.139 --> 02:22:03.560]  Police and government aren't terrorists.
[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.842]  It's these big bad terrorists that never show up.
[02:22:05.862 --> 02:22:06.723]  These Al-Qaeda.
[02:22:07.023 --> 02:22:08.384]  These boogeymen that they have.
[02:22:08.665 --> 02:22:12.568]  By the way, I just found a really evil clip that I'd forgotten about.
[02:22:12.788 --> 02:22:16.251]  Click on the Miami police shot protester, then laugh about it.
[02:22:16.291 --> 02:22:17.452]  I've talked about this video.
[02:22:17.592 --> 02:22:19.754]  Is this when they shoot her in the head through a sign?
[02:22:20.154 --> 02:22:20.955]  And then laugh about it.
[02:22:20.995 --> 02:22:21.355]  She's peaceful.
[02:22:21.375 --> 02:22:22.796]  Yeah, and they say, oh man, you got her.
[02:22:22.837 --> 02:22:24.158]  You got her good right in the head.
[02:22:24.498 --> 02:22:25.158]  Here, here, here.
[02:22:25.179 --> 02:22:25.559]  Fade it up.
[02:22:27.959 --> 02:22:36.288]  Elizabeth Ritter received some media coverage three years ago at a free trade protest when she was shot with rubber bullets in the back and a leg.
[02:22:39.151 --> 02:22:40.412]  Did you shoot me?
[02:22:40.552 --> 02:22:41.974]  Did you shoot me?
[02:22:42.074 --> 02:22:43.515]  Did you shoot me?
[02:22:43.535 --> 02:22:44.416]  A lady in a suit?
[02:22:44.436 --> 02:22:49.422]  She's been walking peace and love under you for half an hour and you shot me with my bat and star?
[02:22:50.182 --> 02:22:54.405]  Her beef wasn't with the trade summit, but with a strong police presence.
[02:22:54.806 --> 02:22:55.166]  Look at him!
[02:22:55.206 --> 02:23:03.572]  Minutes later, she took another rubber bullet, on her forehead, as she crouched behind her homemade sign that read, fear totalitarianism.
[02:23:04.173 --> 02:23:05.174]  You okay?
[02:23:05.234 --> 02:23:09.817]  Don't get around me, let them see it!
[02:23:11.078 --> 02:23:13.841]  Now her case is back in the news because of this.
[02:23:13.861 --> 02:23:19.025]  The good news about being able to watch you guys live on TV is that lady with the red dress.
[02:23:21.977 --> 02:23:29.567]  A police video shot after the shooting incident just released following a review of excessive force complaints at the protest.
[02:23:30.047 --> 02:23:36.015]  I don't know who got her, but when it went through the sun, it hit her smack dab in the middle of the head.
[02:23:41.181 --> 02:23:48.524]  Attorney Ritter says she was too scared to file a complaint before, but now she intends to sue for excessive force.
[02:23:48.944 --> 02:23:52.686]  I was cowering with a poster behind me, but my fingers were in front of the poster.
[02:23:53.126 --> 02:23:59.649]  I believe they thought that my face would have reasonably concluded that my face was behind that poster, and that's why they fired that shot.
[02:24:00.492 --> 02:24:06.473]  The Broward Sheriff's Office says Ritter's possible civil rights lawsuit prevents them from talking specifics.
[02:24:07.174 --> 02:24:10.894]  Officers at the scene tell CNN they warn the crowd to move back.
[02:24:11.014 --> 02:24:12.335]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:24:12.755 --> 02:24:14.455]  Let me explain something, cops.
[02:24:15.135 --> 02:24:16.056]  You've been dehumanized.
[02:24:16.096 --> 02:24:17.336]  You think you've dehumanized us.
[02:24:17.676 --> 02:24:21.357]  When you dehumanize us, you've dehumanized yourself, your children, your whole future line.
[02:24:21.937 --> 02:24:25.118]  And when they get in this gang mentality, the cop commanders, it's a...
[02:24:26.818 --> 02:24:33.323]  Good Ol' Boys Club and the police unions will kick any good police chiefs out to try to get control over them.
[02:24:33.663 --> 02:24:35.505]  So I've watched a lot of police training videos.
[02:24:35.745 --> 02:24:44.211]  The commanders kiss the butt of all the little cops and then they all feed on each other and their hatred and disdain for the public, especially in Miami.
[02:24:44.231 --> 02:24:44.772]  It was a lot.
[02:24:45.272 --> 02:24:53.739]  A federal judge was out there at a previous event in Miami going to their car and the cops cornered him and beat him down and they lost a big suit over that because they didn't know.
[02:24:54.139 --> 02:24:59.324]  They thought they were going to have a little fun on a side street with a judge and went to, I mean, just beat the person almost to death.
[02:24:59.844 --> 02:25:09.112]  And they got in a lot of trouble for that, but that was because that was a real citizen, a God-level person, you know, above them in the government, not a slave scum that's, you know, just here to be stomped on.
[02:25:09.392 --> 02:25:16.558]  And so that's why when I'm driving down the road and there's lanes on both sides of me, Austin Cop, no lights on, just run right up behind you with pleasure.
[02:25:17.219 --> 02:25:19.541]  Just getting, and then swing around and almost hit you.
[02:25:19.781 --> 02:25:38.716]  And then just sit there with a light in your face going, you son of a bitch, citizen, you are slave, civilian, I rule you, and if I want to shoot you in the face with rubber bullets, you know that girl at the Red Sox game came out of a bar, they shot her in the face ten feet away, blew her eyeball back in her brain, she bled to death, the cops went on the news and said she shouldn't have been out there.
[02:25:39.377 --> 02:25:40.578]  Death, death, death.
[02:25:41.178 --> 02:25:41.839]  Hey, don't worry.
[02:25:41.859 --> 02:25:43.180]  The bankers are going to take everything.
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:44.041]  You've got cops.
[02:25:44.501 --> 02:25:47.263]  You think you can just deal death on us and deal pain on us?
[02:25:47.464 --> 02:25:51.727]  You don't think there aren't bigger devils above you in the New World Order that will have their way with you?
[02:25:51.968 --> 02:25:53.509]  You think you're safe from evil?
[02:25:53.889 --> 02:25:56.732]  We have liberty and freedom and we're... Look at that famous photo.
[02:25:57.673 --> 02:25:58.513]  That was in Oregon.
[02:25:59.274 --> 02:26:01.536]  That woman, they said no protest.
[02:26:02.036 --> 02:26:06.841]  She was peacefully with a sign and there's video of that on the web and they just start choking her until she passes out.
[02:26:07.816 --> 02:26:13.658]  Just men in black uniforms grabbing a 55-year-old woman, just choking her.
[02:26:13.978 --> 02:26:16.359]  You're going to learn who we are!
[02:26:16.379 --> 02:26:18.320]  You're going to learn to submit!
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:21.161]  The foreign bankers have given us unlimited power!
[02:26:21.181 --> 02:26:22.881]  And we're going to rule you!
[02:26:23.221 --> 02:26:24.522]  This is our country!
[02:26:25.522 --> 02:26:25.962]  You're here!
[02:26:26.002 --> 02:26:27.543]  We're going to feed on your ass!
[02:26:28.223 --> 02:26:29.904]  And the cops just drink fluoride water.
[02:26:30.084 --> 02:26:32.406]  Oh, they take their kids and just shoot them up with mercury.
[02:26:32.446 --> 02:26:34.047]  And the kids become autistic.
[02:26:34.067 --> 02:26:34.908]  The cops don't care.
[02:26:35.208 --> 02:26:36.709]  They're, I'm going to the Tet Bar.
[02:26:36.749 --> 02:26:38.670]  I don't care if my kid's brain damaged.
[02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:42.132]  And they drink whiskey and wreck and kill everybody in Austin.
[02:26:42.373 --> 02:26:47.976]  And then when they wreck and kill themselves, the cops then go and SWAT team the bar owners that sold them too much whiskey.
[02:26:48.156 --> 02:26:51.118]  It's your fault you sold too much whiskey to a God!
[02:26:51.639 --> 02:26:53.980]  You don't sell too much whiskey to a God!
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:55.181]  We're God!
[02:26:55.401 --> 02:26:56.162]  You understand?
[02:26:56.202 --> 02:26:57.403]  We rule America!
[02:26:58.283 --> 02:26:59.543]  We'll shoot you in the face!
[02:26:59.823 --> 02:27:02.244]  We'll bloody your face and we'll laugh about it!
[02:27:03.024 --> 02:27:04.785]  Because we're weak gang members.
[02:27:05.405 --> 02:27:06.145]  You look at those men.
[02:27:07.026 --> 02:27:08.506]  Go back to the video of the cops laughing.
[02:27:08.526 --> 02:27:09.626]  Look how soft they are.
[02:27:09.926 --> 02:27:12.327]  Look how their eyes don't have any electric liberty in them.
[02:27:12.927 --> 02:27:14.208]  Look at how soft they are.
[02:27:14.888 --> 02:27:16.248]  Look at how disgusting they are.
[02:27:16.268 --> 02:27:19.829]  And you can see a few of the cops in there are looking like they're not having fun.
[02:27:19.849 --> 02:27:22.310]  And if you look at their faces, they look human.
[02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:24.270]  They look like they still have a soul.
[02:27:24.891 --> 02:27:26.051]  Back it up to them laughing.
[02:27:32.622 --> 02:27:35.404]  Now her case is back in the news because of this.
[02:27:35.424 --> 02:27:40.648]  The good news about being able to watch you guys live on TV is that lady with the red dress.
[02:27:43.551 --> 02:27:51.137]  A police video shot after the shooting incident just released following a review of excessive force complaints at the protest.
[02:27:52.058 --> 02:27:52.578]  Hit pause.
[02:27:52.898 --> 02:27:53.259]  Hit pause.
[02:27:53.299 --> 02:27:54.500]  That one's soft right there.
[02:27:55.646 --> 02:28:03.268]  That guy joined the force because, I guarantee you, he's the type of guy that bullied kids that were smaller than him, then those kids grew up and kicked his ass.
[02:28:04.588 --> 02:28:05.368]  I know those types.
[02:28:05.408 --> 02:28:06.328]  I've seen that face.
[02:28:08.289 --> 02:28:09.129]  And now they love it.
[02:28:09.169 --> 02:28:12.170]  They can abuse and beat up everybody and nobody can stop them.
[02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.990]  Nobody can stop them.
[02:28:14.010 --> 02:28:15.610]  They're having their way with America!
[02:28:16.291 --> 02:28:17.431]  They want our guns!
[02:28:17.931 --> 02:28:22.432]  And if you're not with them, cops and military, then you will declare that you're with the Republic now!
[02:28:23.012 --> 02:28:28.415]  Don't tell me that I'm a weirdo because I'm upset about this and I should only go get upset about my favorite football team winning or losing.
[02:28:28.835 --> 02:28:30.396]  Listen, I know what tyranny means.
[02:28:30.496 --> 02:28:32.617]  I know the bankers are putting poison in our food and water.
[02:28:33.017 --> 02:28:35.058]  I know the bankers have stolen 8.5 trillion.
[02:28:35.298 --> 02:28:36.779]  I know we're under War Powers Act.
[02:28:37.079 --> 02:28:38.080]  I know they're hurting us.
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:39.841]  I know they're carrying out New World Order.
[02:28:40.041 --> 02:28:41.902]  I know they staged those terror attacks.
[02:28:42.182 --> 02:28:51.129]  You know what it's like to gut up to this and go out every day and go past the peer pressure and come out day one and say 9-11 was an inside job and lose most of the radio stations I was on?
[02:28:51.309 --> 02:28:57.534]  You know what it's like to go to sleep every night knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers and you bastards are probably going to end up killing me one day?
[02:28:57.714 --> 02:28:59.636]  You know what it's like knowing you've ruined my life?
[02:28:59.816 --> 02:29:01.877]  You know what it's like, you sons of bitches?
[02:29:02.258 --> 02:29:03.539]  I'm tired of your crap!
[02:29:04.159 --> 02:29:08.480]  You commit evil, you're part of an evil system, and we're standing up against you!
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:11.221]  And the Republic is going to defeat you in the end!
[02:29:11.721 --> 02:29:15.002]  Some of us won't make it personally through this, but a lot of us are!
[02:29:15.262 --> 02:29:27.486]  And in the end, you are going to be brought to justice for all the kids you've kidnapped for CPS, all you CPS workers, all you corrupt bureaucrats, all you that have had your way with innocent children over and over again, who think your evil's invincible.
[02:29:27.726 --> 02:29:30.387]  You're not invincible, and God's going to deal with you!
[02:29:31.067 --> 02:29:32.788]  And you are cursed to hell!
[02:29:35.666 --> 02:29:36.006]  I'm done.
[02:29:36.026 --> 02:29:36.726]  I gotta get out of here.
[02:29:36.766 --> 02:29:37.567]  I'm pissed off now.
[02:29:37.627 --> 02:29:39.388]  Robert Wannick, you can make some closing comments.
[02:29:39.708 --> 02:29:40.708]  I'll give you the last two minutes.
[02:29:41.068 --> 02:29:42.109]  We're gonna end transmission.
[02:29:42.729 --> 02:29:44.090]  Make sure the guy's got your address.
[02:29:44.170 --> 02:29:46.030]  I'm sending you those videos so you can resist tyranny.
[02:29:46.351 --> 02:29:46.991]  I salute ya.
[02:29:48.852 --> 02:29:52.013]  You know, they don't, these police, they don't know that they're pawns in the New World Order.
[02:29:52.293 --> 02:29:53.774]  They think they are the highest up.
[02:29:54.094 --> 02:29:55.074]  And that's why they bully.
[02:29:55.354 --> 02:29:56.235]  That's why they bully us.
[02:29:56.535 --> 02:29:57.435]  But they don't understand.
[02:29:57.816 --> 02:29:58.776]  They are no better than us.
[02:29:59.494 --> 02:30:01.979]  The government thinks they're slaves, just like us.
[02:30:02.420 --> 02:30:04.465]  They are dirt to the government, just like we are.
[02:30:04.565 --> 02:30:08.092]  And they either fight with us, or we're gonna have to fight them.
[02:30:09.229 --> 02:30:12.450]  So, visit us over at nwoalert.com.
