[00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:09.772]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.772 --> 00:00:11.354]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:12.935]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:17.098]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:21.161]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:36.307]  We are learning more on this Thursday edition, the 22nd day of January 2009, about the Obama administration's agenda.
[00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:38.588]  And it's exactly what they said it would be.
[00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:50.987]  Now they said one thing publicly and that they hyped that was vague and nebulous about helping everyone in soup kitchens and getting America back on the right track.
[00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:59.117]  But in Obama's actions and lobbying for the Wall Street coup fully taking over the United States,
[00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:15.397]  And in the previous voting record of Barack Obama, and in the individuals he's picking for his administration, and the fine print announcements he's made on his agenda, it is very, very bad.
[00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:19.060]  But some said, well, let's just wait and see what he does once he gets into office.
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.965]  Well, two days into office, less than two full days into being sworn in, it'll be two days and about an hour,
[00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:31.259]  We are now getting a very clear picture.
[00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:45.885]  They've suddenly changed the way whitehouse.gov looks to mirror Obama's change.gov and usaservice.org.
[00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:47.606]  Why is that important?
[00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:55.729]  Well, they're mixing and blurring the lines between his private army and his governmental position.
[00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.070]  So the sites all have the exact same look, basically.
[00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:10.735]  And he's creating a private pool of volunteers with the uniform basically of government on them to merge with the government itself.
[00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:28.948]  Timothy Geithner, the soon-to-be appointed Treasury Secretary, is supposedly going to be giving some details of the new economic plan, but it's the same economic plan that we saw under Bush and Obama in the last four months.
[00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:29.868]  Total secrecy.
[00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:37.490]  They're saying they're not going to let you know where the trillions of dollars are going and won't let you know where the previous trillions are going.
[00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.250]  And up on
[00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.191]  Whitehouse.gov.
[00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:44.655]  I spent quite a bit of time last night and this morning reading the subsections.
[00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:48.619]  On the environment, it's an 80% carbon reduction, as he promised.
[00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:52.523]  Listing carbon dioxide as a toxic waste.
[00:02:52.523 --> 00:02:54.805]  And bringing in a cap-and-trade tax.
[00:02:56.207 --> 00:03:10.711]  So, when we had Rothschild on the show and he said, no, there's no plan with global warming for a tax, and laughed at me, laughed at the audience, and when all of these people say, oh no, global warming isn't about a tax, they're now openly on the White House website saying it's a tax.
[00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:14.812]  Okay, so the denial is completely over, though it will continue.
[00:03:14.812 --> 00:03:19.733]  I know while we're paying taxes, the carbon taxes, if we don't beat this, people will say it's not a tax.
[00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:29.522]  This is the double think, mass mind control, mass lunacy, mass ignorance system we're living under.
[00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:30.563]  So that is coming up.
[00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:47.089]  We have Bob Shatman on in the second hour and Joe Rogan who has been on the show quite a few times over the years over the phone because we became friends I guess about nine years ago just by accident because he was friends with Kevin Booth.
[00:03:48.257 --> 00:03:54.062]  And I found out he was into, quote, conspiracies and things, New World Order.
[00:03:54.062 --> 00:03:58.186]  A few weeks ago I talked to Joe and he said he was coming to Austin, he ought to come in studio, and I talked to him last week.
[00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:04.715]  And then he called the other day and said, yeah, I'll come in on Thursday.
[00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:09.237]  And then we haven't really locked down exactly when he's coming in.
[00:04:09.237 --> 00:04:13.939]  And I kind of forgot about it until this morning and I'm calling his cell phone and he's not answering it.
[00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:15.359]  But Joe Rogan should be in studio.
[00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.861]  I just need to give him the new address of where we're located.
[00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:21.702]  So Joe coming up in the third hour today.
[00:04:21.702 --> 00:04:26.784]  And then Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo.
[00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:28.152]  Yes.
[00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:50.189]  Where you see this agenda going, what you're predicting for the next few years.
[00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.010]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:59.218]  We'll also go through the agenda, the economic agenda of the new Treasury Secretary they're trying to appoint, and the carbon taxes.
[00:04:59.218 --> 00:04:59.618]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.782 --> 00:05:03.865]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:09.389]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.114]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.595]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:25.503]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:05:25.903 --> 00:05:27.745]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[00:06:00.543 --> 00:06:02.684]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:02.684 --> 00:06:05.085]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:07.346]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:08.946]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:08.946 --> 00:06:10.627]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.627 --> 00:06:13.508]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.508 --> 00:06:17.149]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:26.808 --> 00:06:31.519]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.782]  An inside job.
[00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:38.104]  How dare you?
[00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:42.987]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:42.987 --> 00:06:45.888]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:52.332]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:06:57.455 --> 00:06:59.917]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.711]  Time is more precious than money.
[00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:05.092]  You could be running out of time.
[00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:07.813]  I want to share something with you about your body.
[00:07:07.813 --> 00:07:09.594]  Quote, make no mistake about it.
[00:07:09.594 --> 00:07:12.716]  Parasites are the most toxic agents in the human body.
[00:07:12.716 --> 00:07:18.979]  They are one of the primary underlying causes of diseases and are the most basic cause of a compromised immune system.
[00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:20.820]  Dr. Hazel Parcells, PhD.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.902]  Quote, we have a tremendous parasite problem right here in the U.S.
[00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:27.384]  It is just not being addressed.
[00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:34.388]  Dr. Peter Wyna, quote, in terms of numbers, there are more parasitic infections acquired in this country than in Africa.
[00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:39.392]  Dr. Frank Nova, Chief of the Laboratory for Parasitic Diseases of the National Institute of Health.
[00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:42.113]  As you can see, parasites are more dangerous than you think.
[00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:44.735]  For about a buck a day, you can rid yourself of all parasites.

[00:07:58.329 --> 00:08:00.872]  I, uh, I really like it.
[00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:03.635]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.635 --> 00:08:06.418]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:25.025]  Gessner pledges dramatic action.
[00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:35.550]  The Obama administration will take action, nice and simple for the public, on a dramatic scale to revive credit markets and strengthen banks as they are able to lend.
[00:08:36.837 --> 00:09:03.442]  Treasury Secretary Designate Tim Geithner said on Wednesday testifying to the Senate Committee considering his nomination Mr. Geithner said the Obama team was working on a comprehensive plan to deal with the banks and hope to unveil it soon and what they're going to do is they're going to bring this forward the next two weeks he's saying and then when Congress says how much money is it you'll just say it's a blank check
[00:09:04.708 --> 00:09:07.850]  They'll tell the public a number like 700 billion again.
[00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.191]  They're on record.
[00:09:09.191 --> 00:09:16.236]  I have the congressional testimony, it's coming up in the new Obama film, where they say it's just a made-up number, it's unlimited.
[00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:29.821]  And it's been six weeks now, and six weeks ago, in just two months, it was 8.5 trillion they'd stolen, and won't tell anyone where it went, and then now they're just keeping those numbers completely secret.
[00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:34.302]  For all we know, it may be more than 1.3 trillion a week they're stealing.
[00:09:34.302 --> 00:09:36.062]  That's what they were doing before.
[00:09:36.062 --> 00:09:46.344]  Now it's all completely secret, nothing is coming out, no one knows anything in Congress, and they have told in federal lawsuits against
[00:09:46.884 --> 00:10:01.369]  The Treasury Department and the Private Fellow Reserve, they're on record saying that the legislation gave them the power to tell no one where it went and that no court or legislature in the land can even investigate or review.
[00:10:01.369 --> 00:10:13.434]  Now that was the subsection in the bill and we read it over and over and over and over and over and over again on the air week after week when they were trying to ram it through
[00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:21.809]  Terrorizing the public, saying we'd have a depression if they didn't, that day one they were going to unfreeze the subprime mortgages, that that was, quote, the threat.
[00:10:21.809 --> 00:10:34.853]  And then, it passed October 3rd, October 4th, on a Saturday, Treasury Secretary Halson, Fed Chairman Bernanke came out and said, well, we're actually not going to use any of the money for that now, it's not a problem now, that isn't what caused all this.
[00:10:34.853 --> 00:10:36.694]  Well, that was actually true, and we told everybody that.
[00:10:38.499 --> 00:10:45.733]  And so now they're coming in again saying we need even more power and they're going to say there's going to be a depression if you don't do this.
[00:10:45.733 --> 00:10:47.777]  It'll be the same trick they played in
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:11:01.670]  Late September, early October for two weeks saying depression, depression, depression and that destroying confidence in the markets plunging so they could go in and buy it up and we know what they've done with the money.
[00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:14.142]  They've bought gold and they bought up key stocks that they know they're not going to completely destroy in the future and they bought up infrastructure because it's come out here and there and the private fellow reserve is quietly to institutions and governments issuing its own bonds now.
[00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:23.559]  Before the Treasury issued them and then interest on the bonds was paid to the banks.
[00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:29.642]  So it is just, you think the looting has been bad so far, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:11:29.642 --> 00:11:38.086]  And the levels are so catastrophic, so leviathan, so gargantuan, so colossal, so
[00:11:40.598 --> 00:11:50.083]  Humongous in their scale that it's already irrevocable financial destruction of not just the United States but the world for the general public and countries.
[00:11:50.083 --> 00:12:01.768]  Not for the elite, this is the final round of risk, global domination as they financially dominate the nations they can and militarily the nations that resist them.
[00:12:01.768 --> 00:12:03.409]  Now, it's all been done through fraud.
[00:12:05.094 --> 00:12:18.102]  You know, if somebody tricks you into signing a fraudulent contract, handing over everything you own and making you a sharecropper slave for life, you can't just say it's a fraudulent contract, break it and not go along with it.
[00:12:18.102 --> 00:12:22.624]  You know, for contracts to stand up in court, they have to have consideration, they have to be somewhat fair.
[00:12:22.624 --> 00:12:23.725]  Well, this is a fraud.
[00:12:23.725 --> 00:12:28.668]  These are the people that engineered the economic crisis, seized the executive through Northcom,
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:40.243]  and other systems of Homeland Security, terrorized the public and Congress into going along with something that was 98% unpopular in every major poll.
[00:12:40.243 --> 00:12:41.743]  Some were 99%.
[00:12:41.743 --> 00:12:44.844]  They were getting 1,000 to 1 phone calls in Congress.
[00:12:44.844 --> 00:12:49.006]  That's on record.
[00:12:49.006 --> 00:12:51.626]  And so what's happening?
[00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:53.327]  They're now bringing us into Round 2.
[00:12:55.447 --> 00:13:04.617]  And Congress, the clips are up on YouTube, yesterday said, well tell us what you'll do with the new plan, and tell us what your new plan is going to be.
[00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:11.185]  And he said, I can't tell you, I'm just going to need you to pass the bill when we give it to you in two weeks.
[00:13:11.185 --> 00:13:16.591]  I mean, if they've already got almost complete omnipotent power, unlimited, what will the new thing be?
[00:13:17.776 --> 00:13:31.859]  Well, the key here is Geithner saying this is going to be internationally coordinated and that will be the Congress signing over Federal Reserve Banking Authority with a new 1913 style Federal Reserve Accord.
[00:13:31.859 --> 00:13:41.822]  Just like under the World Trade Organization in 96, 95-96 in different accords, the Congress handed over most of its trade authority to an unelected private international board.
[00:13:43.575 --> 00:13:44.656]  Through a treaty.
[00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:48.601]  It will be a treaty with the private consortium, the banking cartel.
[00:13:51.089 --> 00:13:56.832]  The Globalist, out of London and out of Europe, because they've announced this, what it's going to be.
[00:13:56.832 --> 00:13:59.033]  Congress says, well, what's the plan going to be?
[00:13:59.033 --> 00:13:59.853]  What are you proposing?
[00:13:59.853 --> 00:14:02.054]  Well, it's international in scope, but I can't tell you.
[00:14:02.054 --> 00:14:13.040]  But they already did tell us in the Times of London, and in the Wall Street Journal, and in Newsweek, with headlines like, New World Bank to run world currencies and other financial institutions.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.181]  Acting as world government.
[00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:18.022]  So we know what it is.
[00:14:18.022 --> 00:14:19.843]  So let me tell you what's going to be proposed.
[00:14:22.435 --> 00:14:25.436]  But first let me digress.
[00:14:25.436 --> 00:14:33.818]  While the bill they passed on October 3rd, giving them dictatorial complete power with no oversight and immunity, said one thing.
[00:14:33.818 --> 00:14:46.741]  Publicly they said it's only 700 million, it's total transparency, everything will be public, everything will be reviewed, everything will be available, Congress is in control of this, the Treasury Secretary is in control of this.
[00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:49.682]  Meanwhile the bill said 180 degrees the opposite of that.
[00:14:50.626 --> 00:14:52.188]  Well, it's going to be the same thing here.
[00:14:52.188 --> 00:14:53.449]  Total transparency.
[00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:55.832]  Total, the public will be made abreast.
[00:14:55.832 --> 00:14:58.035]  None of this will go to CEO bonuses.
[00:14:58.035 --> 00:15:00.257]  None of this will go to broker bonuses.
[00:15:00.257 --> 00:15:02.440]  None of this will go to shareholders.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.482]  The government's going to get a stake in this.
[00:15:04.482 --> 00:15:06.725]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:15:06.725 --> 00:15:08.207]  Do it or we're going to have a depression.
[00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:12.682]  And if Congress bolts again and says, but where's the other money?
[00:15:12.682 --> 00:15:13.642]  What'd you do?
[00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:16.745]  They'll go, okay, the market just went down 3,000 points.
[00:15:16.745 --> 00:15:33.479]  And they'll go, okay, okay, okay, we'll sign a new Federal Reserve, but a Global Federal Reserve Act agreeing for Congress to fully, not just hand over the power to the Treasury Secretary and the private Fed boss, but we'll hand the power over to the complete European shareholders.
[00:15:33.479 --> 00:15:36.521]  And that's why you have current and former Fed board members.
[00:15:37.462 --> 00:15:47.311]  Bloomberg saying we've asked what's going on and we've been told you will not be told war powers has been enacted and only the Fed governors in New York know what's happening.
[00:15:49.192 --> 00:15:55.417]  But then if you reverse engineer it and look at what they've been proposing, getting everybody ready for it, you know what's going on behind the scenes.
[00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:57.039]  You understand the magnitude?
[00:15:57.039 --> 00:16:09.069]  They are going to bring the private Federal Reserve System, with its already foreign shareholders, publicly into the open world government banking taxation system.
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:19.245]  And I read Lou Rockwell, I read all the other patriot and libertarian sites, and I'm sorry, none of them even get it.
[00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:20.286]  Ron Paul gets it.
[00:16:22.369 --> 00:16:25.091]  And he'll get on air and say, yeah, they're probably going to try to move to that.
[00:16:25.091 --> 00:16:27.653]  And I'm like thinking, Congressman, have you read Newsweek?
[00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.174]  Have you read Financial Times?
[00:16:29.174 --> 00:16:30.215]  I mean, have you read all the news?
[00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:32.456]  They're saying it!
[00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:39.321]  I mean, they said they would use the Patriot Act on Americans for misdemeanors and non-terror related.
[00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:45.126]  And I had law scholars and people laugh at me for two years and finally apologize and say, oh, I guess it does say that.
[00:16:45.126 --> 00:16:49.349]  And now they're charging tens of thousands a month with it all over the country at the federal and state level.
[00:16:49.969 --> 00:17:02.156]  I mean I'm not that smart and I'm frankly I don't understand why I'm the only one that it seems sees this absolutely clearly other than maybe professor Michelle Chosodosky.
[00:17:02.156 --> 00:17:06.098]  He is the only other person.
[00:17:06.098 --> 00:17:10.720]  And I know Ron Paul knows it but he doesn't like to come all the way out with it because he knows the media can spin that against him.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.303]  But the time for mincing words and holding back is over.
[00:17:15.303 --> 00:17:16.904]  I was up here at midnight last night
[00:17:18.852 --> 00:17:43.909]  And saw a clip on Yahoo News, I think we sent it to the webmasters, they're posting it on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we'll play it later if we have time, of Glenn Beck of all people, with Ron Paul yesterday, saying world government's taking over through the banks, both parties are controlled, this is a world government, and then he read a founding father quote about banks being more dangerous than standing armies that would overthrow America.
[00:17:45.814 --> 00:17:52.255]  It was like Alex Jones had suddenly possessed Glenn Beck on Fox News and then Ron Paul came in and agreed.
[00:17:52.255 --> 00:17:54.256]  So I don't even know what that means.
[00:17:54.256 --> 00:18:14.340]  I guess the establishment thinks Fox News is so discredited with the public that if Fox News comes out and talks like Alex Jones that somehow... so in a way this is starting to come out, but no one is talking or discussing the fact that they are about to publicly... I mean the mainstream news is admitting they're doing it, but then our own movement
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:21.145]  That's been right all along, cannot come to grips with the fact that it's actually happening now.
[00:18:21.145 --> 00:18:22.586]  It's here.
[00:18:22.586 --> 00:18:24.387]  It's here in the next two, three weeks.
[00:18:24.387 --> 00:18:25.508]  It's here ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.081]  And I just couldn't believe it.
[00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:31.144]  I couldn't believe that Glenn Beck was doing this.
[00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:37.350]  Remember, Glenn Beck was saying Ron Paul supporters are dangerous, the army needs to be used against them, they're domestic enemies.
[00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.293]  I put a clip of that in Truth Rising.
[00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:46.420]  See, back when Ron Paul could have actually won and was exploding like a grass fire, the establishment shot him down and attacked him.
[00:18:47.648 --> 00:19:07.062]  Now that the establishment thinks it's too late, that they're getting what they want, they're already bringing us into the depression, they don't care, now some US media is being forced to report the truth because they would lose their whole audience if they didn't, and their CEOs and people, I guarantee you, have told them, hey, it doesn't matter, the truth's out anyways, go ahead and report it, the people can't stop us now.
[00:19:08.222 --> 00:19:10.924]  I mean, Glenn Beck is a Benedict Arnold.
[00:19:10.924 --> 00:19:25.536]  If he comes out and apologizes and says, I was an agent, or I was reading Talking Points, and I made a mistake, and I apologize, and I henceforth swear to fight the New World Order and go forward against tyranny, then I would say, okay, we'll give you a second chance, but we're going to watch you closely.
[00:19:28.362 --> 00:19:33.129]  But, uh, the way this guy's like a crab and walks sideways, I don't like it.
[00:19:33.129 --> 00:19:38.858]  But it is a big plus that Lou Dobbs is saying New World Order, world government's taking over, it's a scam.
[00:19:38.858 --> 00:19:40.540]  Glenn Beck is saying it on Fox.
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:40.740]  I mean...
[00:19:42.165 --> 00:19:44.728]  Folks, but we were saying it 13 years ago.
[00:19:44.728 --> 00:19:46.270]  Do you understand?
[00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.752]  Everything we've said has been true.
[00:19:47.752 --> 00:19:49.334]  Everything we've said has been accurate.
[00:19:49.334 --> 00:19:52.899]  Because we're only going off the Globalist's own documents.
[00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:55.402]  We're going to break more of this down with Bob Chapman coming up later.
[00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:57.224]  But first, your phone call straight ahead.
[00:19:57.224 --> 00:19:59.187]  Be sure and check out PrisonPlanet.tv!
[00:20:00.862 --> 00:20:02.182]  I am so frustrated.
[00:20:02.182 --> 00:20:04.523]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[00:20:04.523 --> 00:20:05.103]  What?
[00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:07.863]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[00:20:07.863 --> 00:20:09.283]  I read something and forget.
[00:20:09.283 --> 00:20:10.544]  I forget people's names.
[00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:14.324]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[00:20:14.324 --> 00:20:16.065]  I... Okay, slow down.
[00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:18.625]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:25.786]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[00:20:25.786 --> 00:20:27.407]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[00:20:27.407 --> 00:20:29.147]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[00:20:29.147 --> 00:20:30.067]  Even entire books.
[00:20:30.307 --> 00:20:30.587]  What?
[00:20:30.587 --> 00:20:31.167]  How?
[00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:34.408]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[00:20:34.408 --> 00:20:38.189]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[00:20:38.189 --> 00:20:47.811]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons.
[00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:53.193]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[00:20:53.193 --> 00:20:53.713]  Wow.
[00:20:53.713 --> 00:20:54.493]  What's the website?
[00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:58.217]  Now don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[00:20:58.217 --> 00:21:00.159]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[00:21:10.342 --> 00:21:11.883]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:11.883 --> 00:21:12.684]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:12.684 --> 00:21:13.725]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:13.725 --> 00:21:15.066]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:17.048]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:17.048 --> 00:21:24.194]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:24.194 --> 00:21:24.694]  Some U.S.
[00:21:24.694 --> 00:21:30.319]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:34.542]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:34.542 --> 00:21:37.324]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:01.647 --> 00:22:05.530]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.931]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:06.931 --> 00:22:10.813]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:10.813 --> 00:22:13.735]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:13.735 --> 00:22:15.797]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:15.797 --> 00:22:18.098]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:22:19.159 --> 00:22:33.646]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:22:33.646 --> 00:22:36.928]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:22:36.928 --> 00:22:39.129]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-GOLD.
[00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:44.172]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:22:44.172 --> 00:22:46.494]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:22:46.494 --> 00:22:47.214]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:22:47.214 --> 00:22:50.036]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:50.897]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:23:00.794 --> 00:23:04.317]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:23:04.317 --> 00:23:06.238]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:23:06.238 --> 00:23:11.782]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:23:11.782 --> 00:23:19.827]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:23:19.827 --> 00:23:30.555]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[00:23:30.555 --> 00:23:30.895]  I think so.
[00:24:06.093 --> 00:24:07.714]  Monday through Friday, we're here live.
[00:24:07.714 --> 00:24:10.795]  11 a.m.
[00:24:10.795 --> 00:24:11.435]  to 3 p.m.
[00:24:11.435 --> 00:24:12.476]  Central Standard Time.
[00:24:12.476 --> 00:24:13.957]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:13.957 --> 00:24:15.998]  Central.
[00:24:15.998 --> 00:24:24.061]  Please don't forget we have a free podcast linked on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that more than 125,000 people are subscribing to every day.
[00:24:24.061 --> 00:24:31.005]  Please tell your friends, your family, your neighbors about the free podcast so they can listen where they want, how they want, on whatever device they wish.
[00:24:32.691 --> 00:24:38.994]  We are intensifying everything we're doing here as we go into this imploding economy.
[00:24:38.994 --> 00:24:40.954]  We don't need to just stay the same size we are.
[00:24:40.954 --> 00:24:49.118]  We need to expand and that's why we put up a donate button for folks that want to go donate on PayPal at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:49.118 --> 00:24:52.920]  I want to thank some folks that did donate when we first put that up yesterday afternoon.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:25:00.683]  Thank you so much because again the expenses here are just mounting and we were victims of our own success with the bandwidth situation.
[00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:28.844]  And it is a big nut to crack plus personnel building all the expenses and you know we we go with the main system I pay taxes because I'm not going to give them an excuse to come in and shut us down we we choose our battles so we have a lot of issues we're facing but we're continuing to grow and move forward and if that means I eat hamburger instead of steak that's just fine but again ladies and gentlemen
[00:25:30.919 --> 00:25:33.741]  The donate button is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:40.366]  We're going to continue with Bob Chapman on the economy and the World Government Bank openly being set up, the birth publicly of the New World Order.
[00:25:40.366 --> 00:25:42.928]  They're going to attempt the next three weeks.
[00:25:42.928 --> 00:25:48.392]  That is coming up, but right now let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Illinois.
[00:25:48.392 --> 00:25:49.333]  Tony, you're on the air.
[00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:52.375]  Hey Alex, how you doing today bud?
[00:25:52.375 --> 00:25:53.796]  Pretty good.
[00:25:53.796 --> 00:25:58.600]  Hey, you know, I was thinking about that Glenn Beck, I was watching that myself.
[00:25:59.926 --> 00:26:06.569]  And you're right, it's about the fact that Fox is discredited that Glenn Beck's bringing this stuff up.
[00:26:06.569 --> 00:26:14.631]  Now, there has to be some hokey, again, Punch and Judy show media of a voice of dissent.
[00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:18.733]  Now, Fox News, who's played cheerleader to Bush,
[00:26:19.246 --> 00:26:28.071]  For the last eight years, it's going to be suddenly this voice of reason and Obama-mania here.
[00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:38.558]  And because it's so discredited, now when I say they're setting up a World Government Bank when it's in the Financial Times of London, when it's in the Wall Street Journal, when it's in Newsweek, they'll say, you just got that off Fox!
[00:26:39.534 --> 00:26:40.856]  Exactly, Alex.
[00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:50.106]  I mean, I could think of no other worse company to keep, I mean, for you to be linked up with Fox News.
[00:26:50.106 --> 00:26:52.449]  I mean, just from, of course, you're not.
[00:26:52.449 --> 00:26:54.691]  Glenn Beck said none of this existed.
[00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:56.673]  We needed to have the Army used against us.
[00:26:56.673 --> 00:26:57.995]  Ron Paul was bad.
[00:26:57.995 --> 00:26:59.697]  And then as soon as Ron Paul was defeated...
[00:27:01.098 --> 00:27:05.440]  And literally Obama copied his grassroots, the way the site looked, the way they did it, everything.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.720]  That was a real grassroots movement.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:13.482]  They killed it, they demonized it, and they all went on TV and said 9-11 truthers are terrorists, and then boom!
[00:27:13.482 --> 00:27:18.244]  Suddenly he flips and openly says world government's taking over.
[00:27:18.244 --> 00:27:24.906]  Oh yeah, but you know, I mean let me tell you Alex, just for, you know, because these are seemingly hopeless times, but
[00:27:25.526 --> 00:27:26.987]  They're not hopeless.
[00:27:26.987 --> 00:27:28.289]  I mean, I am out there.
[00:27:28.289 --> 00:27:32.272]  I mean, I don't, in public, I don't refer to them as President Obama.
[00:27:32.272 --> 00:27:34.734]  It's Lord or Emperor Obama.
[00:27:34.734 --> 00:27:36.756]  People, everybody agrees.
[00:27:36.756 --> 00:27:37.597]  They laugh.
[00:27:37.597 --> 00:27:39.519]  They know exactly.
[00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:44.443]  I'm in the suburbs of Chicago, which they call the blonde bimbo of the city.
[00:27:44.443 --> 00:27:47.186]  And they're more aware of, you know,
[00:27:48.262 --> 00:27:54.208]  You're not hearing, oh, it's not just some old white dude, you know, they're hearing, oh God, you know, look at it.
[00:27:54.208 --> 00:28:07.219]  Well, I mean, not just Blagojevich or all the corruption of Bill Richardson or the corruption of Rahm Emanuel, now Rangel's in trouble for a bunch of scams, the Congressman, I mean, this is a pack of
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.423]  Let's not forget about Hillary and everything she did for Walmart.
[00:28:12.423 --> 00:28:14.205]  I'm from the rural part of Missouri.
[00:28:14.205 --> 00:28:15.066]  Walmart killed us.
[00:28:29.163 --> 00:28:49.454]  And now it's the only major company, everybody else is doing horrible, but they're posting record profits because they have the slave centers, they have the melamine food, they have all the crud, and people think, well things are bad, I better go to the best value, so they rise with 10-12% profit increases last time I saw a week ago, while everything else implodes.
[00:28:49.454 --> 00:28:55.638]  I mean, again, as the parasitic system implodes things, the few big parasites, the bankers, Walmart,
[00:28:56.158 --> 00:28:58.558]  Now, over 40% of world retail?
[00:28:58.558 --> 00:29:01.899]  I mean, they're just taking over!
[00:29:01.899 --> 00:29:07.400]  Let me tell you, Alex, I work for one of their competitors, and because of something I signed, I can't say who.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:25.243]  But let me just say, I was supposed to work yesterday, they called me at 9.30 in the morning, I work in customer service, they called me at 9.30 in the morning, and told me to stay home, and then I got another call today, thank God I'm off today and tomorrow, but they called me again today,
[00:29:25.854 --> 00:29:29.835]  So let me know that it was closed again today and tomorrow.
[00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:31.756]  It's bad, folks.
[00:29:31.756 --> 00:29:34.617]  Go buy a candy bar for a dollar.
[00:29:34.617 --> 00:29:36.318]  You know what I mean, Alex?
[00:29:36.318 --> 00:29:36.918]  Absolutely.
[00:29:36.918 --> 00:29:38.438]  I appreciate your call.
[00:29:38.438 --> 00:29:41.259]  Diane, Bart, Matt, Laura, and others.
[00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:42.000]  Stay with us.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:51.003]  More straight ahead on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:51.003 --> 00:29:52.403]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.403 --> 00:29:53.924]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.935 --> 00:30:00.719]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.719 --> 00:30:06.543]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:30:06.543 --> 00:30:11.986]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:30:11.986 --> 00:30:17.370]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.932]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:30:21.212 --> 00:30:23.252]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[00:30:23.252 --> 00:30:29.494]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:33.275]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:30:33.275 --> 00:30:38.096]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:30:38.096 --> 00:30:39.136]  Do your part.
[00:30:39.136 --> 00:30:41.757]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:47.878]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:30:48.238 --> 00:30:50.620]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.741]  Loose change, final cut.
[00:30:51.741 --> 00:30:52.901]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:54.482]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:08.837 --> 00:31:12.101]  The late great USA, America, freedom to fascism.
[00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:19.128]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:31:59.699 --> 00:32:03.182]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:03.182 --> 00:32:06.965]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:06.965 --> 00:32:13.290]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:17.914]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:32:17.914 --> 00:32:23.938]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:32:23.938 --> 00:32:27.361]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:32:27.361 --> 00:32:28.042]  Run sump pumps,
[00:32:28.502 --> 00:32:28.822]  I think so.
[00:32:49.224 --> 00:32:50.065]  We're good to go.
[00:33:14.226 --> 00:33:24.690]  Babylon system is the vampire, yeah.
[00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:33.253]  Sucking the children day by day, yeah.
[00:33:33.253 --> 00:33:38.315]  They say the Babylon system is the vampire,
[00:33:43.803 --> 00:33:45.924]  The Babylon system is the vampire.
[00:33:45.924 --> 00:33:53.907]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:33:53.907 --> 00:33:58.389]  Continuing with your phone calls, coming up later in studio, Joe Rogan.
[00:33:58.389 --> 00:34:03.691]  Anti-New World Order guy, but also the host of Ultimate Finding.
[00:34:03.691 --> 00:34:06.292]  NewsRadio.
[00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:06.912]  Fairfactor.
[00:34:09.031 --> 00:34:12.332]  Have the popular culture folks in here, see what they think of what's happening in the world.
[00:34:12.332 --> 00:34:19.955]  And Police Chief Art De Cervedo later in studio in the fourth hour today.
[00:34:19.955 --> 00:34:25.918]  Bob Chapman coming up in about 26 minutes from now on the economy.
[00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:30.380]  And same system Obama pushed.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.281]  The real transition of government started months ago, even before he got elected.
[00:34:33.281 --> 00:34:35.002]  And there he was out there pushing in October.
[00:34:35.002 --> 00:34:36.942]  You've got to pass this banker bill.
[00:34:36.942 --> 00:34:38.283]  It's got total transparency.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:40.960]  It will fix everything.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.741]  It will help the people.
[00:34:41.741 --> 00:34:44.182]  Meanwhile, they stole it all and said, we're not going to tell you where it is.
[00:34:44.182 --> 00:34:46.543]  The bill says we can do that.
[00:34:46.543 --> 00:34:47.483]  See, they lie to the public.
[00:34:47.483 --> 00:34:49.884]  Remember two years ago?
[00:34:49.884 --> 00:35:05.890]  There's thousands of these lies when they said, don't worry, this new bill we've introduced, right when the Democrats got control of the House and Senate in 2006, they said, don't worry, this new bill is an amnesty for the 30 million illegal aliens that we promised, but it's secret.
[00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:06.991]  We're not going to let you see the bill.
[00:35:07.918 --> 00:35:09.099]  Remember that?
[00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:10.500]  That's a free society.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:19.125]  And then Senator Sessions leaked the bill in an article called 20 Loopholes.
[00:35:19.125 --> 00:35:28.990]  And it wasn't loopholes, it said that it was total, complete amnesty for all illegal aliens, including felons, and that for six years anyone who came here would be completely legal.
[00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.412]  And they would automatically re-up after that
[00:35:33.848 --> 00:35:35.649]  For another six years.
[00:35:35.649 --> 00:35:37.330]  And they said, okay, it was amnesty.
[00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.791]  I mean, they are a pack of criminal liars.
[00:35:40.791 --> 00:35:46.174]  Even if you're for amnesty and globalism and open borders, which is the globalist plan.
[00:35:46.174 --> 00:35:48.775]  Even if you're suckered by all that propaganda, do you like being lied to?
[00:35:48.775 --> 00:35:53.937]  I mean, is that a good thing?
[00:35:53.937 --> 00:35:55.037]  And so that's what they're going to do.
[00:35:55.037 --> 00:35:59.199]  They're going to tell us, oh, we need to unfreeze the subprime mortgages again.
[00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:00.280]  Give us even more power.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.721]  But they've already got unlimited domestically through fraud.
[00:36:07.714 --> 00:36:09.655]  And so what is the next thing going to be?
[00:36:09.655 --> 00:36:17.919]  It's going to be Congress signing over its final authority to an international body.
[00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:20.080]  We'll talk with Bob Chapman about that right now.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.640]  Back to the calls.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.621]  Diane in New York.
[00:36:21.621 --> 00:36:23.442]  You're on the air, Diane.
[00:36:23.442 --> 00:36:24.502]  Hi, Alex.
[00:36:24.502 --> 00:36:31.726]  I think Obama's coronation is a good time for me to, with your permission, announce an event that We Are Change is holding this Sunday.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:39.281]  It's a free preparedness and self-reliance clinic, and it's being given by Eitan Edwards.
[00:36:39.281 --> 00:36:47.103]  He's head of International Self-Reliance and Preparedness Network, which is an international first responder organization.
[00:36:47.103 --> 00:36:55.124]  A little bit about Mr. Edwards is that right after 9-11, he got on the radio in New York and said, please, the air is not safe to breathe.
[00:36:55.124 --> 00:36:57.004]  Please wear a respirator if you go down there.
[00:36:57.004 --> 00:36:59.385]  And Mayor Giuliani got very, very angry.
[00:36:59.385 --> 00:37:00.925]  Yeah, I said, shut up, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:37:02.196 --> 00:37:09.519]  You're with us or against us, breathe the poison or you're anti-American.
[00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:10.980]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:18.443]  Anyway, it's going to be an all-day thing from 11 to 7.30 at the Yippee House Museum and Cafe at 9 Bleecker Street.
[00:37:18.443 --> 00:37:22.865]  You can go to the We Are Change website and see the poster and the description of it.
[00:37:22.865 --> 00:37:24.086]  It's 9 Bleecker Street.
[00:37:25.038 --> 00:37:36.829]  Um, and it's free, and we want, he's going to discuss things like nuclear preparedness, what to do when there's no doctor, and also stuff we can use right now, such as gardening and solar power.
[00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:37.529]  Good.
[00:37:37.529 --> 00:37:40.772]  Anything else, Diane?
[00:37:40.772 --> 00:37:42.734]  Anything else, Diane?
[00:37:42.734 --> 00:37:43.955]  Uh, that's pretty much it.
[00:37:43.955 --> 00:37:45.416]  Thank you for letting me describe that.
[00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:45.857]  You bet.
[00:37:45.857 --> 00:37:46.237]  Thank you.
[00:37:46.237 --> 00:37:46.858]  Good to hear from you.
[00:37:46.858 --> 00:37:47.638]  Keep it up.
[00:37:47.638 --> 00:37:48.559]  Bart in Texas.
[00:37:48.559 --> 00:37:49.040]  You're on the air.
[00:37:50.717 --> 00:38:03.167]  Hey Alex, I wanted to expand a little bit on a comment you made yesterday concerning the Obama presidency, where you were kind of predicting assassination attempts or a rise in gun violence.
[00:38:03.167 --> 00:38:06.369]  I just wanted to say that I really think that's really accurate.
[00:38:06.369 --> 00:38:12.694]  When you look at the modus operandi of the neoconservatives, they were about projecting power outward.
[00:38:12.694 --> 00:38:17.138]  Their whole position was to get the global empire positioned.
[00:38:17.138 --> 00:38:19.780]  Now the neoliberals, they're all about projecting power
[00:38:20.419 --> 00:38:21.279]  Inward.
[00:38:21.279 --> 00:38:23.500]  And that's the phase that we're moving in now.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:38.105]  Now, a couple of months back or a couple of weeks back, you had an article on Prison Planet that was talking about a gentleman in Austin, I think, that had sat at a barn and this guy came up in Washington and was talking about 9-11 Truth and like, we need to do violence and we need to do this and that.
[00:38:38.105 --> 00:38:44.547]  I really think we can expect to see, as a way of demonizing the Ron Paul movement, a way of demonizing the Liberty movement,
[00:38:45.034 --> 00:38:54.596]  Some kind of gun violence that will be directly associated, just like the militias were demonized in the nineties under Clinton, I think we can look for a program to now demonize the Liberty Movement.
[00:38:54.596 --> 00:39:04.959]  Yes, the new Attorney General was the Deputy Attorney General for Oklahoma City, and we even got his emails and documents via lawsuits involved covering up the investigation of that.
[00:39:04.959 --> 00:39:12.281]  And yes, that was a false flag directed against the American people as a pretext to crack down on anti-globalists.
[00:39:13.178 --> 00:39:24.800]  And yes, I believe that you're now going to see that phase, but they're also going to have the international phase, encircling Russia, going into Afghanistan, saber-rattling with Iran, because it's not two different management teams.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.181]  It's the same crew, it's just going to be different rhetoric and a different approach.
[00:39:29.181 --> 00:39:41.763]  And I got all these emails yesterday saying, how dare you cover up the fact that Obama is requesting the Pentagon suspend the kangaroo court trials of the people held between seven to four years, depending on the different people they're trying.
[00:39:42.524 --> 00:39:43.728]  Uh, at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:39:44.795 --> 00:39:54.297]  Well, there on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, we did link to the top couple of paragraphs and then a link to the mainstream news stories.
[00:39:54.297 --> 00:39:59.038]  In fact, we put two stories up on each site yesterday about that.
[00:39:59.038 --> 00:40:11.361]  But then I went on air and pointed out that Bush and others had already talked about suspending that trial because it was too obvious and it wasn't real and the people had been held for many years and had been tortured.
[00:40:11.361 --> 00:40:13.862]  And a few weeks ago, if you could pull it up, was it three weeks ago?
[00:40:14.682 --> 00:40:23.589]  They marched some of the defendants in, and the news said they're going to plead guilty, showing the scripting, the news already knowing, and then they suddenly said, what do you plead?
[00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:29.373]  And then they said, we've been tortured, we've been tortured, we didn't do it, we don't want to be executed.
[00:40:29.373 --> 00:40:37.500]  Because they had promised them if they pled guilty that they wouldn't be executed, but then they found out they were going to reverse it and still execute them.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.382]  And so they said, we've been tortured, we've been tortured, it's not real.
[00:40:40.382 --> 00:40:43.744]  And so, again, the kangaroo thing is so embarrassing.
[00:40:44.905 --> 00:40:50.949]  As ABC News reported, and again, I'm not tooting our horn, we said this six months ago because we saw what the administration was saying they might do.
[00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:52.791]  You know, they float this stuff.
[00:40:52.791 --> 00:41:00.356]  They said, we're going to close Guantanamo, or we're looking at it, but we're going to open other camps in other parts of the world.
[00:41:00.356 --> 00:41:02.237]  Well, they've already opened those years ago.
[00:41:02.237 --> 00:41:08.581]  Black sites, the true ghost sites, not the public, you know, camp they show people at Guantanamo that's bad enough.
[00:41:08.581 --> 00:41:14.025]  But then ABC News announced that they're going to have the camps in 14 locations inside the United States.
[00:41:14.945 --> 00:41:17.647]  South Carolina, California, Texas, other places.
[00:41:17.647 --> 00:41:28.233]  And so, again, you know, these ignorant Obamanoids are telling me I'm a Bush supporter and I'm a racist, and I'm like, no, I'm reporting the facts to you, you idiots.
[00:41:28.233 --> 00:41:35.497]  And so, again, Obama will be more subtle, he will package it better than just Bush's overt arrogance.
[00:41:35.497 --> 00:41:35.817]  Go ahead.
[00:41:36.792 --> 00:41:48.317]  No, I think you're right, and I'm not trying to say it all, but I think any of the agenda, you know, Russia's still floating out there, the whole Crescent, the big new Brzezinskis, you know, whole plans for out there.
[00:41:48.317 --> 00:41:50.498]  Russian encirclement?
[00:41:50.498 --> 00:41:57.041]  Yeah, the neoliberals really seem to be the Fabians, and the neoconservatives really seem to be the Nazis.
[00:41:57.041 --> 00:42:01.923]  But see, that's the synergy, that's the synergy of the overlords, they give you the two false choices.
[00:42:02.774 --> 00:42:10.777]  Exactly, and that's also why Obama was such a logical choice after Bush, because he is literally everything about Bush inverted.
[00:42:10.777 --> 00:42:12.458]  And I don't just mean his color.
[00:42:12.458 --> 00:42:14.979]  I mean the way he presents himself, the way he speaks.
[00:42:14.979 --> 00:42:23.423]  And now, you know, we've energized this entire liberal movement and, you know, it's just they love... As a rebuke to Bush!
[00:42:23.423 --> 00:42:25.824]  As a rebuke to Bush, not knowing they've been trapped.
[00:42:26.849 --> 00:42:27.569]  Exactly.
[00:42:27.569 --> 00:42:27.990]  Exactly.
[00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:37.134]  Now we're going to have to go through the same process that we went with all these good old boys that were, you know, not bad people that wanted to support Bush and believed in Bush and bought into that archetype.
[00:42:37.134 --> 00:42:41.316]  Now we're going to have to go through the exact same process on the other side of the fence.
[00:42:41.316 --> 00:42:42.376]  And it's sophisticated.
[00:42:42.376 --> 00:42:48.259]  And how do you get a public who doesn't even know where their state capitals are or what the system of government is to understand that?
[00:42:48.259 --> 00:42:49.399]  You plant the seeds.
[00:42:49.399 --> 00:42:50.920]  You constantly plant the seeds.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.741]  I mean, we already know that there's going to be
[00:42:53.208 --> 00:42:57.092]  And even greater resurgence of Ron Paul's popularity.
[00:42:57.092 --> 00:43:00.895]  The campaign for liberty is exploding.
[00:43:00.895 --> 00:43:02.557]  We will pass through this.
[00:43:02.557 --> 00:43:07.161]  Every one individual that's activated and knows the truth and is out there and speaking the truth and putting it
[00:43:07.592 --> 00:43:19.785]  If we bust our butts, if each of us that's worth a thousand of the zombies takes action and literally burns the candle at both ends.
[00:43:19.785 --> 00:43:24.329]  And I've, you know, I told my wife a year ago, I said, baby, let me finish these projects and I'll cut back.
[00:43:24.329 --> 00:43:27.372]  And I had to tell her last night, I said, do you want me to cut back?
[00:43:27.372 --> 00:43:29.715]  Because I can't, I'm going to have to work 18 hours a day again.
[00:43:29.715 --> 00:43:30.456]  And she said, do it.
[00:43:30.976 --> 00:43:32.617]  We don't have a future if you don't do it.
[00:43:32.617 --> 00:43:33.138]  No, no.
[00:43:33.138 --> 00:43:38.782]  And my children this morning were begging me not to go to work, though, because they didn't see me yesterday, any.
[00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:42.285]  But I'm doing it because they have no future if I don't.
[00:43:42.285 --> 00:43:43.085]  No, we have to.
[00:43:43.085 --> 00:43:44.907]  Look, I've taken up two jobs.
[00:43:44.907 --> 00:43:46.208]  I'm doing my TV show.
[00:43:46.208 --> 00:43:47.789]  I'm helping with the Campaign for Liberty.
[00:43:47.789 --> 00:43:49.530]  I'm helping with 9-11 Truth.
[00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:50.331]  You're 100% right.
[00:43:50.331 --> 00:43:54.033]  I'm working on projects on the family land to start getting gardens out there.
[00:43:54.033 --> 00:43:56.615]  You know, everything that I do, and that's the way we all have to be now.
[00:43:56.615 --> 00:43:58.517]  This is militant, and I've watched you for years.
[00:43:58.857 --> 00:44:06.339]  And I've been amazed at the energy that you put into this, but everybody that does that will find that the further you get into this, the more real it becomes.
[00:44:06.339 --> 00:44:08.939]  You won't be able to work on anything else.
[00:44:08.939 --> 00:44:10.800]  I can't play video games anymore.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.581]  I don't enjoy going to the movies anymore, because it's just this passé mind screen that's projected on everything.
[00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:27.124]  I sit there and I watch the movie, and all I can look at is either the Illuminati symbolism in the movie, or I'm thinking about, you know, all of the false messages that are being projected by that entertainment onto the minds in the audience.
[00:44:27.324 --> 00:44:28.165]  And it's an insult.
[00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.305]  It's an assault.
[00:44:29.305 --> 00:44:36.170]  When you're conscious, you see it all, and you burn with desire and passion to warn people.
[00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:38.911]  And it's not even that we're goody two-shoes of these great humanitarians.
[00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:44.375]  We know it's about survival, and we know how wicked this new world order is, and we're desperate to warn people.
[00:44:44.375 --> 00:44:50.739]  Just like if you see a child walking out in the street with a big bus coming, and you start screaming, little boy, come here!
[00:44:50.739 --> 00:44:52.620]  Little boy, little girl, get off the street!
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.020]  Get off!
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:53.560]  Get off!
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.861]  And they're just laughing, going, that bus loves me!
[00:44:56.861 --> 00:45:03.703]  That bus is... we are, you know, yes we can, Bob the Builder, la la la, can we fix it?
[00:45:03.703 --> 00:45:04.363]  Yes we can.
[00:45:04.363 --> 00:45:05.664]  You're like, no, it's a bus!
[00:45:05.664 --> 00:45:06.344]  It's a bus!
[00:45:06.344 --> 00:45:07.604]  It's coming fast, little boy!
[00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:09.165]  And he's like, no!
[00:45:09.165 --> 00:45:11.385]  No, the bus driver told me you're the bad man!
[00:45:11.385 --> 00:45:14.906]  And then you gotta watch, you just ram them down, run them over.
[00:45:14.906 --> 00:45:17.347]  And it just... We will be victorious.
[00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:19.288]  You know, we just, we have to keep our heads up.
[00:45:19.288 --> 00:45:20.568]  We have to keep moving forward.
[00:45:20.908 --> 00:45:26.432]  And if things are going to get bad and things are going to get bloody, then that's God's will, but we've planted the seeds for a better tomorrow.
[00:45:26.432 --> 00:45:26.833]  I hear you.
[00:45:26.833 --> 00:45:28.814]  Good to hear from you, Bart.
[00:45:28.814 --> 00:45:30.195]  Let's talk to Matt in Ohio.
[00:45:30.195 --> 00:45:30.956]  Matt, you're on the air.
[00:45:30.956 --> 00:45:35.620]  My call.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.222]  I watched that silly inauguration yesterday, bro.
[00:45:39.222 --> 00:45:42.985]  I gotta tell you, all those people, it was like a herd of sheep.
[00:45:42.985 --> 00:45:44.687]  Lambs to the slaughter.
[00:45:44.687 --> 00:45:45.027]  Yeah.
[00:45:46.332 --> 00:45:48.293]  Our country is turning into a dictatorship.
[00:45:48.293 --> 00:45:49.274]  It's astounding.
[00:45:49.274 --> 00:45:55.079]  They built the infrastructure, now they're giving you the cherry on top, the messianic leader.
[00:45:55.079 --> 00:45:56.660]  Absolutely.
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.803]  When I saw that, Alex, tell me if you agree with me.
[00:45:59.803 --> 00:46:06.428]  It reminded me of pictures I saw growing up studying world history of Hitler and the masses before him.
[00:46:06.428 --> 00:46:09.311]  Sir, we're making this film about Obama.
[00:46:09.311 --> 00:46:14.255]  We have the film shot by the Nazis of the exact same looks on those men and women's faces
[00:46:15.009 --> 00:46:16.251]  Absolutely.
[00:46:16.251 --> 00:46:19.634]  That was the first thing that I thought of when I saw this huge number.
[00:46:19.634 --> 00:46:21.937]  Sir, watching it, I become nauseous.
[00:46:21.937 --> 00:46:23.278]  Yeah.
[00:46:23.278 --> 00:46:25.921]  It was absolutely astounding to me.
[00:46:25.921 --> 00:46:28.244]  I tell you, Alex, we're in big trouble.
[00:46:29.454 --> 00:46:34.160]  We're about to see an utter destruction of everything our country was founded on.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.385]  The banks, two months in, had stolen $8.5 trillion.
[00:46:38.385 --> 00:46:40.167]  Now we don't know how much they're stealing.
[00:46:40.167 --> 00:46:41.069]  It's totally secret.
[00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:44.032]  They're saying there's an international solution.
[00:46:44.032 --> 00:46:45.514]  It's coming in two to three weeks.
[00:46:46.135 --> 00:46:47.635]  And then the Congress says, what is it?
[00:46:47.635 --> 00:46:49.056]  And they say, we won't tell you.
[00:46:49.056 --> 00:46:52.557]  But then, at the same time, they're announcing what it is.
[00:46:52.557 --> 00:46:56.878]  It's a world government bank we pay our carbon taxes to.
[00:46:56.878 --> 00:47:00.999]  It's Newsweek, Financial Times of London, Wall Street Journal.
[00:47:00.999 --> 00:47:07.720]  Glenn Beck is acting like he's against it, but not giving details and not telling his listeners how to fight it or how to stop it.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.181]  I mean, my God, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:10.061 --> 00:47:11.462]  I mean, this is so incredible.
[00:47:11.462 --> 00:47:22.592]  To know we're living in this time, and to know it's really happening, and then even the Liberty Movement, the Patriot Movement, I listen and I hear and I watch it, and most of them don't fully get it.
[00:47:22.592 --> 00:47:25.174]  I mean, this is just off the charts.
[00:47:25.174 --> 00:47:25.674]  It is.
[00:47:25.674 --> 00:47:27.996]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:47:27.996 --> 00:47:30.658]  And you know, this is the funny part.
[00:47:30.658 --> 00:47:31.219]  The people
[00:47:31.917 --> 00:47:35.518]  Are allowing this to happen because they believe everything they hear in the media.
[00:47:35.518 --> 00:47:37.279]  They're too lazy to find the real truth.
[00:47:37.279 --> 00:47:45.421]  But what happened is, Congress got a 9% approval rating, the public woke up, but only that they were being lied to, and they got fooled by the old bait-and-switch.
[00:47:45.421 --> 00:47:55.124]  Okay, yeah, Bush is bad, everybody boo him, you know, the anvil's been lifted off of our chest, the weight's been lifted off of our back, now here's the new savior, and the media all gets behind him.
[00:47:55.984 --> 00:47:59.885]  You know, this is a growing process where it took four to six years for people to wake up to Bush.
[00:47:59.885 --> 00:48:04.345]  They're going to wake up to Obama in less than a year, and that's Obama's own administration.
[00:48:04.345 --> 00:48:05.346]  Of course they are.
[00:48:05.346 --> 00:48:10.667]  Biden, when he's talking to an inner circle of powerful Democrats, you know, 300 of them, what's he say?
[00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:12.827]  Listen, the people aren't going to like this.
[00:48:12.827 --> 00:48:15.187]  Within a hundred days, they're going to get really upset.
[00:48:15.187 --> 00:48:18.448]  Within the first day he gets in, they're not going to like what he starts doing.
[00:48:18.448 --> 00:48:20.888]  So, you know, we've got to circle the wagon.
[00:48:20.888 --> 00:48:24.689]  So they're having to give pep talks internally to their own people
[00:48:25.189 --> 00:48:27.731]  That they've got a rough road to go down, okay?
[00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:31.794]  They can put out this slick image of invincibility and all this power and they're going to do it.
[00:48:31.794 --> 00:48:37.958]  And they may get away with it because it's so big and so outrageous and so incredible, but they may not.
[00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:45.204]  And even if they get their world government publicly launched with us paying taxes to them, then we just keep exposing that and saying no.
[00:48:45.204 --> 00:48:49.607]  I mean, you know, it's... Thank you for the call, I appreciate it.
[00:48:52.762 --> 00:48:58.508]  I keep saying I'm staggered by all of this, I'm just completely thunderstruck, almost dumbstruck by it.
[00:48:58.508 --> 00:49:03.973]  It's just, it's so real, it's so tangible, it's so out in the open.
[00:49:03.973 --> 00:49:15.744]  And I've still got all these neocon websites and liberal sites writing articles about me every week saying, Jones is insane, there's no PNAC, there's no new world order, there's no move for world government, he's insane, he believes in little green men.
[00:49:16.816 --> 00:49:19.398]  When all I'm covering is their own documents.
[00:49:19.398 --> 00:49:22.300]  And these are operatives.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:26.863]  To know... I mean, here's a microcosm of it.
[00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:27.363]  You know, watch it.
[00:49:27.363 --> 00:49:27.823]  A.K.A.
[00:49:27.823 --> 00:49:29.284]  Tommy Chong.
[00:49:29.284 --> 00:49:37.469]  To know that it's legal to sell water pipes and pipes all over the country, except for a few cities.
[00:49:37.469 --> 00:49:44.053]  To know that the city, that they ended up having to make an order so the feds could bust them, tried for a year to buy
[00:49:45.496 --> 00:50:03.259]  a pipe from Tommy Chung Sung's website to know that they infiltrated and tried for two years and got an employee in who as an informant or mailed the bong, mailed the pipe to the
[00:50:04.778 --> 00:50:10.060]  Police in the city where it was illegal and that it came out in court that they did that.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.161]  I mean, that's planting.
[00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:19.244]  And then to know that's what narcotics police, way over 80% do, and they do it to innocent people and feel good all day.
[00:50:19.244 --> 00:50:21.665]  My mind doesn't compute that.
[00:50:21.665 --> 00:50:26.086]  I mean, if you're saying we're following the law, we're busting drug dealers, we're busting people that use drugs.
[00:50:26.086 --> 00:50:29.868]  Well, why do you then go frame people that aren't doing anything or aren't breaking the law?
[00:50:31.618 --> 00:50:33.079]  I mean, how do they do that?
[00:50:33.079 --> 00:50:41.964]  How does Homeland Security arrest a woman whose children spill a drink?
[00:50:41.964 --> 00:50:42.725]  And it's in the L.A.
[00:50:42.725 --> 00:50:49.068]  Times, and the feds are in the article defending it, and she's going to prison as a terrorist under the Patriot Act.
[00:50:49.068 --> 00:50:50.769]  They're evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:50.769 --> 00:50:52.851]  They're evil.
[00:50:52.851 --> 00:50:54.271]  Evil.
[00:50:54.271 --> 00:50:55.372]  Evil.
[00:50:55.372 --> 00:50:56.052]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:56.573]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.102]  The headlines are clear.
[00:51:03.102 --> 00:51:06.025]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[00:51:06.025 --> 00:51:09.228]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[00:51:09.228 --> 00:51:10.990]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:14.293]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[00:51:14.293 --> 00:51:17.055]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[00:51:17.055 --> 00:51:17.916]  To stay free.
[00:51:18.957 --> 00:51:22.600]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.982]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:28.844]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.

[00:51:33.467 --> 00:51:36.609]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[00:51:36.609 --> 00:51:45.795]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[00:51:45.795 --> 00:51:47.296]  Restaurants and small delis.
[00:51:47.296 --> 00:51:48.517]  Don't buy from copycats.

[00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:00.762]  A long-term food solution.
[00:52:00.762 --> 00:52:07.504]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.504 --> 00:52:09.165]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.137 --> 00:52:11.697]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.697 --> 00:52:12.498]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.498 --> 00:52:13.498]  This is his M.O.s.
[00:52:13.498 --> 00:52:14.838]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.838 --> 00:52:16.859]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.859 --> 00:52:24.001]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.001 --> 00:52:24.481]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.481 --> 00:52:30.123]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.823 --> 00:52:34.324]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.324 --> 00:52:37.125]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:08.061]  Are you one of the millions of people who make New Year's resolutions?
[00:53:08.061 --> 00:53:12.043]  Are you also one of the millions who wind up breaking those resolutions?
[00:53:12.043 --> 00:53:15.144]  Would you like to keep at least one of those resolutions this year?
[00:53:15.144 --> 00:53:18.265]  Well, right now, success is one click away.

[00:54:03.174 --> 00:54:09.798]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:09.798 --> 00:54:18.684]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:18.684 --> 00:54:30.712]  By the way, I haven't even gotten to the fact that when we first announced on air a few days ago that Obama had done his oath of office wrong and had not sworn to protect and defend the republic,
[00:54:32.059 --> 00:54:36.100]  People didn't believe us, then it came out in the mainstream news.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:41.722]  And then he was re-administered the oath yesterday without the Bible and in secret.
[00:54:41.722 --> 00:54:42.743]  Now this is a stunt.
[00:54:42.743 --> 00:54:46.724]  Talk about a cultic, talk about New World Order.
[00:54:46.724 --> 00:54:49.565]  See, they're letting you know things are different now.
[00:54:49.565 --> 00:54:55.107]  He isn't going to publicly do it right, and then when he does it, it's going to be in private and without a Bible.
[00:54:55.107 --> 00:54:58.408]  I mean, they are doing all of this on purpose.
[00:54:58.408 --> 00:54:58.928]  I want to
[00:55:02.861 --> 00:55:06.324]  I want to play him taking the oath of office.
[00:55:06.324 --> 00:55:10.607]  Here it is for listeners.
[00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:22.076]  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of President to the United States faithfully.
[00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:36.794]  The office of President of the United States faithfully, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:55:36.794 --> 00:55:37.255]  So help you God?
[00:55:37.255 --> 00:55:37.695]  So help me God.
[00:55:37.695 --> 00:55:38.455]  Congratulations Mr. President.
[00:55:49.093 --> 00:55:51.514]  I want to get started with this now before Bob Chapman gets on.
[00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:53.435]  I talked about this Fox News piece.
[00:55:53.435 --> 00:55:56.636]  I'm going to play this with Ron Paul last night on Fox News on Beck's new show.
[00:55:56.636 --> 00:56:00.297]  Then we're going to analyze it and critique it.
[00:56:00.297 --> 00:56:01.258]  So here is that.
[00:56:03.746 --> 00:56:05.427]  You know, I'm just like you, man.
[00:56:05.427 --> 00:56:08.590]  I watch the news and I see it and I'm like, wait a minute, that's not a separate story.
[00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:10.251]  These stories are all connected.
[00:56:10.251 --> 00:56:14.655]  The media never puts them together like a puzzle, but that's really what the news is.
[00:56:14.655 --> 00:56:16.016]  Let's put something together.
[00:56:16.016 --> 00:56:22.121]  First, the housing market collapses because banks are forced to make loans with people who can't pay them back.
[00:56:22.121 --> 00:56:24.983]  Next, we bail out Bonanza.
[00:56:24.983 --> 00:56:25.884]  Stop.
[00:56:25.884 --> 00:56:27.245]  The banks weren't forced to do that.
[00:56:27.245 --> 00:56:30.268]  They rewrote the laws so that they could give it to people that didn't have money.
[00:56:30.928 --> 00:56:34.889]  They changed the law where they didn't have fractional reserve banking, 10-to-1 leveraging.
[00:56:34.889 --> 00:56:36.629]  It was unlimited.
[00:56:36.629 --> 00:56:40.430]  And the very same... So see, Beck's not really doing... Keep going.
[00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.930]  With no results.
[00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:44.091]  Next, where's that money coming from?
[00:56:44.091 --> 00:56:49.512]  Oh yeah, we're printing it in the basement and devaluing our currency.
[00:56:49.512 --> 00:56:50.552]  That's only part of it.
[00:56:50.552 --> 00:56:54.753]  Then you've got to pay that money back in taxes to the very banks it's being given to.
[00:56:55.473 --> 00:56:56.333]  Back to it.
[00:56:56.333 --> 00:56:58.754]  We're starting to nationalize our banks.
[00:56:58.754 --> 00:56:59.615]  This is pretty good.
[00:56:59.615 --> 00:57:03.336]  Bank of America will literally become Bank of America, which is great because we can save money.
[00:57:03.336 --> 00:57:04.516]  That's not true.
[00:57:04.516 --> 00:57:05.097]  That's not true.
[00:57:05.097 --> 00:57:10.939]  Just like they did the bait and switch and said the Federal Reserve was governmental, now everybody knows it's private.
[00:57:10.939 --> 00:57:17.221]  The new Bank of the USA, they're talking about, is a dual Federal Reserve that is nexused into the international system.
[00:57:17.221 --> 00:57:18.501]  This has all been announced.
[00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:19.842]  Issuing its own bonds.
[00:57:21.348 --> 00:57:34.091]  And so all you have is the big mega central banks that already own the controlling stock in Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, Citibank, and a few others, Wells Fargo, openly coming in now and merging it all into one.
[00:57:34.091 --> 00:57:34.451]  Here we go.
[00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:37.152]  We have to spend money on new signs.
[00:57:37.152 --> 00:57:39.073]  This all forms a big puzzle.
[00:57:39.073 --> 00:57:40.073]  Here it is.
[00:57:40.073 --> 00:57:44.234]  The government is to blame for each and every one of these pieces.
[00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:45.635]  Stop there.
[00:57:45.635 --> 00:57:47.396]  The government is not completely to blame.
[00:57:47.396 --> 00:57:52.660]  I mean, when a mafia don sends out a capo to commit a new scam, they're both guilty.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:58.644]  The mafia capo carrying out the operation with the soldiers under him, and his boss, the don, above him.
[00:57:58.644 --> 00:58:00.165]  Okay?
[00:58:00.165 --> 00:58:04.608]  So, this is international bankers that have engineered all of this.
[00:58:04.608 --> 00:58:11.994]  This is Barack Obama, who was their main front man when it wasn't going to pass, who went to the floor of the House and Senate and demanded it pass.
[00:58:11.994 --> 00:58:12.334]  Okay?
[00:58:14.008 --> 00:58:21.230]  The government is to blame for writing the blank check under threat of martial law via the executive to do it, though.
[00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:22.270]  Let's keep rolling a bit more.
[00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:25.751]  President Obama, is he Bush on steroids?
[00:58:25.751 --> 00:58:31.753]  And how long is this going to last before somebody says, okay, this isn't making any sense to me.
[00:58:31.753 --> 00:58:32.693]  It's making great sense.
[00:58:32.693 --> 00:58:33.473]  It's a giant heist.
[00:58:33.473 --> 00:58:38.855]  The only thing you said true back there is that this is George Bush on steroids.
[00:58:42.503 --> 00:58:45.125]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.125 --> 00:58:50.631]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.631 --> 00:58:51.271]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:51.271 --> 00:58:52.332]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.332 --> 00:58:57.077]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.077 --> 00:59:00.040]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.082]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.082 --> 00:59:07.807]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.007 --> 00:59:09.147]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.147 --> 00:59:12.389]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.389 --> 00:59:19.371]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:59:39.708 --> 00:59:40.949]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.502 --> 00:59:55.904]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.904 --> 01:00:05.131]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.131 --> 01:00:06.432]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.432 --> 01:00:08.214]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.214 --> 01:00:09.374]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.374 --> 01:00:11.536]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.536 --> 01:00:12.337]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:17.284]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.284 --> 01:00:21.927]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.927 --> 01:00:28.171]  Bob Chapman's coming up in the next segment, then Joe Rogan's in studio, and then the Austin Police Chief in studio.
[01:00:28.171 --> 01:00:31.674]  Continuing with open phones as well for everybody that's patiently holding.
[01:00:31.674 --> 01:00:34.576]  I wanted to play a little bit of Ron Paul on Glenn Beck last night.
[01:00:34.576 --> 01:00:35.577]  Glenn Beck, who...
[01:00:36.897 --> 01:00:40.901]  Nine months ago, ten months ago, it looked like Ron Paul might be able to win.
[01:00:40.901 --> 01:00:45.305]  He came out and said Ron Paul supports him to have the army engage them as domestic enemies.
[01:00:45.305 --> 01:00:47.548]  But see, that was back when Ron Paul could win.
[01:00:47.548 --> 01:00:54.515]  Now, Beck has to act like he's exposing the New World Order because they know that's what the majority of the public are who aren't on the Obama Kool-Aid.
[01:00:54.515 --> 01:00:55.496]  So we're analyzing this.
[01:00:55.496 --> 01:00:56.096]  Here it is.
[01:00:56.096 --> 01:00:57.738]  Bush on steroids.
[01:00:57.738 --> 01:01:00.240]  And how long is this going to last before somebody says,
[01:01:01.141 --> 01:01:04.363]  Okay, this isn't making any sense to me anymore.
[01:01:04.363 --> 01:01:08.666]  Republican Congressman and former presidential candidate Ron Paul is joining us now.
[01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:10.967]  Hello, Congressman, how are you?
[01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.668]  Good, nice to be with you.
[01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:19.392]  You know, the more I read of the Founding Fathers and the more I read your words, they're almost interchangeable.
[01:01:19.392 --> 01:01:22.674]  Let me start with the words of Thomas Jefferson.
[01:01:22.674 --> 01:01:23.135]  Here it is.
[01:01:23.815 --> 01:01:28.977]  I sincerely believe that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armories.
[01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:37.281]  And the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling futurity on a large scale.
[01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:40.082]  Wanted to get you on because I don't know if futurity is a real word.
[01:01:40.082 --> 01:01:41.183]  Futurity.
[01:01:41.183 --> 01:01:41.363]  Fut...
[01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:43.904]  Any idea?
[01:01:43.904 --> 01:01:44.264]  No.
[01:01:44.264 --> 01:01:57.491]  Okay, anyway, Thomas Jefferson is basically saying the banks stealing from our children and funding us is a really bad thing, and the banks are a really bad thing when we get into bed with them.
[01:01:57.491 --> 01:02:00.133]  And that's exactly what we're doing.
[01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:04.595]  You've been crying out in the wilderness for a long time and people haven't really been listening to you.
[01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:05.956]  And you know what, Congressman?
[01:02:06.796 --> 01:02:09.057]  I don't know if they're listening to you yet.
[01:02:09.057 --> 01:02:16.220]  Well, that's because you said they were terrorists, Beck, and said Ron Paul was dangerous.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:20.841]  That's because you helped just slow down our movement, pal.
[01:02:20.841 --> 01:02:22.622]  That's why.
[01:02:22.622 --> 01:02:23.862]  But people actually are listening.
[01:02:23.862 --> 01:02:25.003]  There he is putting out the disinfo.
[01:02:25.003 --> 01:02:25.723]  People are listening.
[01:02:25.723 --> 01:02:27.284]  That's why you've got him on.
[01:02:27.284 --> 01:02:28.204]  What's it gonna take?
[01:02:29.902 --> 01:02:37.046]  I think it's going to take a collapse of the dollar because there's no intent here in Washington to change its ways.
[01:02:37.046 --> 01:02:41.429]  We're spending more, borrowing more, and printing more, and that's why we're in the trouble that we're in.
[01:02:42.014 --> 01:02:43.435]  Well, Congressman, it's worse than that.
[01:02:43.435 --> 01:02:45.977]  It's all being taken offshore by design to bankrupt us.
[01:02:45.977 --> 01:02:49.960]  It's not that they're screwing up and doing the wrong thing and don't know what they're doing.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.483]  You know, these things they call banks that are more dangerous than standing armies aren't even classic banks.
[01:02:54.483 --> 01:02:59.607]  It's money changers that run Ponzi scheme scams and bankrupt and buy off governments.
[01:03:00.347 --> 01:03:02.229]  It's called the Rothschilds.
[01:03:02.229 --> 01:03:06.393]  So, since we're not going to do that, all the burden is placed on the value of the dollar.
[01:03:06.393 --> 01:03:12.959]  You can't create trillions and trillions of dollars and think we can bail out all the bad investments.
[01:03:12.959 --> 01:03:14.981]  They're not bailing out the bad investments.
[01:03:14.981 --> 01:03:21.447]  They're writing that off and letting it sit there and letting the people get hit for it while they take it and buy up the real assets.
[01:03:22.448 --> 01:03:27.452]  Yeah, that's all we seem to be doing here, and it's sort of contagious.
[01:03:27.452 --> 01:03:32.396]  We have appropriated money to bail out so many big companies and big banks already.
[01:03:32.396 --> 01:03:37.541]  It is the excuse for coming back, and nobody can be denied now.
[01:03:37.541 --> 01:03:42.004]  Now you can say, well, so-and-so needs money, and they're logical.
[01:03:42.004 --> 01:03:47.529]  They say, well, if you bail out the big banks and AIG and all these companies, why not bail out the little guy?
[01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:53.199]  That's right, Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler, has said he wants a $5 billion bailout.
[01:03:53.199 --> 01:04:04.744]  So the bailout is a disease, it's contagious, it's ongoing, and the result of this will be the destruction of the dollar, which to me means runaway inflation and political chaos.
[01:04:04.744 --> 01:04:06.625]  So it's very, very dangerous.
[01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:14.289]  Hang on, because you're saying runaway inflation, you're meaning Weimar Republic, wheelbarrow full of money kind of stuff to buy a loaf of bread.
[01:04:15.149 --> 01:04:17.831]  Is that the kind of inflation you're talking about?
[01:04:17.831 --> 01:04:19.752]  I think it'll end before it gets that far along.
[01:04:19.752 --> 01:04:22.594]  They'll come to their senses, but it's going to be bad.
[01:04:22.594 --> 01:04:23.535]  Come to their senses?
[01:04:23.535 --> 01:04:32.261]  They're creating the crisis, the vortices, the black hole, to destroy everything and then set up their new world order where you pay your carbon taxes to the private central banks.
[01:04:32.261 --> 01:04:33.221]  It's all stated.
[01:04:33.221 --> 01:04:35.242]  Trilateral Commission, CFR, Club of Rome.
[01:04:35.242 --> 01:04:38.345]  But everybody's lulled to sleep and say, well, there's no inflation.
[01:04:38.345 --> 01:04:42.367]  But if you measure inflation by the increase in supply of money, I mean, we're doing it.
[01:04:42.367 --> 01:04:44.729]  So the inflation is already... Well, that's because you've got
[01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:50.271]  A depressionary, hyper-stag inflation.
[01:04:50.271 --> 01:04:50.891]  Okay?
[01:04:50.891 --> 01:04:55.313]  Hyper-stag inflation, my coin term, with that Top Economist on, they say, that is accurate.
[01:04:55.313 --> 01:05:00.135]  Bob Chapman, with his political and economic acumen, straight ahead.
[01:05:01.149 --> 01:05:04.691]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[01:05:04.691 --> 01:05:07.173]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:54.563]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:54.563 --> 01:05:57.386]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:10.593 --> 01:06:11.955]  Who is the enemy?
[01:06:11.955 --> 01:06:12.755]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.755 --> 01:06:13.756]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:13.756 --> 01:06:15.118]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:15.118 --> 01:06:17.120]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:24.267]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.267 --> 01:06:24.747]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:30.392]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:31.093 --> 01:06:34.595]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.595 --> 01:06:37.397]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:02.734 --> 01:07:06.797]  Gentlemen, I know you need no reminder that Valentine's Day is right around the corner.

[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.581]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:53.581 --> 01:07:55.122]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:22.004]  We're going to Bob Chapman here in just a moment.
[01:08:22.004 --> 01:08:24.206]  But I want to tell you about a new sponsor.
[01:08:24.206 --> 01:08:25.086]  They're great patriots.
[01:08:25.086 --> 01:08:26.507]  They're based right here in Central Texas.
[01:08:26.507 --> 01:08:27.969]  They collect rainwater.
[01:08:29.403 --> 01:08:35.065]  And then they purify it, and they're looking for distributors of Patriot bottled water.
[01:08:35.065 --> 01:08:38.907]  For folks that want that, it's PureRainUSA.com.
[01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.127]  We use it right here in the office.
[01:08:40.127 --> 01:08:40.807]  It's great stuff.
[01:08:40.807 --> 01:08:42.748]  You can also order it in bulk from them.
[01:08:42.748 --> 01:08:44.029]  Very inexpensive.
[01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:48.851]  That's the place to go to buy the best tasting, highest quality, all premium bottled water on the market.
[01:08:48.851 --> 01:08:51.572]  PureRainUSA is listed on ThePrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:51.572 --> 01:08:54.713]  If you live in Central Texas area, you've probably seen the PureRain panel truck.
[01:08:55.493 --> 01:09:02.077]  Or door magnets on the cars of volunteers that help distribute and support this outstanding company and their mission to change the world.
[01:09:02.077 --> 01:09:06.801]  Find out more about their mission at purereinusa.com and to do it the right way.

[01:09:38.225 --> 01:09:42.288]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, PureRainUSA.com.
[01:09:42.288 --> 01:09:45.651]  One word, PureRainUSA.com, or give them a call at 512-514-1076.
[01:09:51.817 --> 01:09:53.499]  512-514-1076 or TexasPureRain.com.
[01:09:53.499 --> 01:09:58.505]  So there's PureRainUSA.com and TexasPureRain.com as well.
[01:10:03.254 --> 01:10:04.795]  Let's go to Bob Chapman.
[01:10:04.795 --> 01:10:08.659]  Bob, big new developments publicly.
[01:10:08.659 --> 01:10:10.600]  I mean, we knew what was going to happen.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:21.150]  First, they give the private Federal Reserve and Treasury unlimited power to have no transparency and steal trillions a week and take it offshore and not say where it went.
[01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:25.453]  The second part of their plan in Bretton Woods too, which they put out in major publications,
[01:10:26.374 --> 01:10:32.076]  Is a world bank that we pay our taxes to that sets the interest rates and controls the world currencies.
[01:10:32.076 --> 01:10:35.056]  So we'll have one global currency for nations that are under it.
[01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:37.937]  It's just that they will then phase in changing the currencies.
[01:10:37.937 --> 01:10:43.339]  Now Geithner's come before Congress and said, I won't give you details, but it's an international solution coming in the next two, three weeks.
[01:10:44.179 --> 01:10:46.401]  And they're talking about it being very unpopular.
[01:10:46.401 --> 01:11:00.350]  The next move will be signing over, like they did with the World Trade Organization, the power over the Federal Reserve openly to an international body and the abdication of Congress's authority.
[01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:01.011]  High treason.
[01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:06.274]  So, Geithner is now announcing this, the guy that doesn't pay the taxes to the Federal Reserve.
[01:11:06.274 --> 01:11:07.175]  Why should he?
[01:11:07.175 --> 01:11:08.815]  He works for the private bankers.
[01:11:08.815 --> 01:11:10.436]  Why would he pay taxes to himself?
[01:11:10.436 --> 01:11:12.238]  So, Bob Chapman, can you break down this?
[01:11:12.238 --> 01:11:16.780]  I mean, we knew this was coming, but now they're getting ready to announce it.
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:26.826]  Well, over in Europe, we've seen strong signs of it from Tony Blair and Scott Sarkozy in France.
[01:11:28.903 --> 01:11:42.265]  They've been pushing this international regulatory solution, and in my mind, most of the major currencies are headed toward default and devaluation.
[01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:56.228]  I'm sure that there will be some that won't make it that far, but generally speaking, there'll be a corruption of the fiat money world, and so that is being done deliberately so that they
[01:11:56.781 --> 01:12:07.864]  Can try to implement these international regulations, which in turn will lead to an international currency.
[01:12:07.864 --> 01:12:08.904]  Absolutely.
[01:12:08.904 --> 01:12:13.225]  Now they've put out two or three different proposals of how they're going to do this, but they told us they are doing it.
[01:12:13.225 --> 01:12:18.846]  What do you think the most likely rollout of this will be?
[01:12:18.846 --> 01:12:22.047]  Probably the first collapse.
[01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:24.928]  And that looks like it might be England.
[01:12:24.928 --> 01:12:25.428]  And there's
[01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:33.574]  Anybody who follows the markets knows that we usually follow England by 6 to 12 months.
[01:12:33.574 --> 01:12:35.276]  I don't think it's going to happen overnight.
[01:12:35.276 --> 01:12:39.222]  It'll go into the talking stage once a key member
[01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:43.215]  It goes under, and England has been chosen for that.
[01:12:43.215 --> 01:12:49.358]  Why are key Illuminists coming out and bad-mouthing England and saying it's bankrupt, about to fully collapse?
[01:12:49.358 --> 01:12:57.442]  I mean, clearly, then, they want it to collapse if they're cheerleading and jumping up and down on top of it, trying to push it under the water.
[01:12:57.442 --> 01:12:58.803]  That's right.
[01:12:58.803 --> 01:13:02.465]  And Ireland is close behind now.
[01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:05.026]  Spain's an excellent candidate.
[01:13:05.026 --> 01:13:07.988]  And, of course, the Eastern European countries, such as
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:23.887]  Latvia and Lithuania and I'm sure that those riots we've just seen are going to spread to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary and we've already had riots in Greece.
[01:13:23.887 --> 01:13:27.889]  All of those currencies will probably go under.
[01:13:27.889 --> 01:13:34.792]  They're even talking about the Balkanization of Ukraine and Poland as well.
[01:13:34.792 --> 01:13:37.013]  And so, you know, they're on the march.
[01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:41.828]  And that'll be part of the plan to disrupt the international financial structure.
[01:13:43.439 --> 01:13:47.422]  In order to get whatever this new unit is that they're dreaming up.
[01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:50.063]  But it won't happen overnight, it'll take awhile.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.941]  Well, there's no question that's what he is.
[01:14:16.941 --> 01:14:24.025]  He's certainly not eminently qualified to be president.
[01:14:24.025 --> 01:14:37.972]  The psychological warfare has to be greater than it has been already because people, except for people who listen to programs like this, they don't even think about another currency.
[01:14:37.972 --> 01:14:41.334]  They don't think about something like that happening.
[01:14:41.334 --> 01:14:42.655]  It's going to be a big surprise.
[01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:45.438]  And so it has to be justified.
[01:14:45.438 --> 01:14:59.583]  And the justification is a or some major countries having to say, we are going to devalue our currency and we're not going to pay our debts.
[01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:05.165]  And when that happens, they're going to say, well, this is going to spread all over the place, so we better do something about it.
[01:15:05.165 --> 01:15:06.065]  And here's the plan.
[01:15:08.098 --> 01:15:08.659]  Absolutely.
[01:15:08.659 --> 01:15:24.335]  So they endure the crisis and then their solution is an open world government run by this new super central bank which is made up of the shareholders of Europe, the United States and Japan's central banks, a handful of families.
[01:15:24.335 --> 01:15:28.859]  I'm sure you've seen Newsweek and all of them are now saying a world bank, a world government to save you.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:35.602]  How are they going to sell that con when even the dumbest idiot knows it's the central banks that engineered this crisis?
[01:15:35.602 --> 01:15:41.484]  How are they going to pose as the savior when publicly they engineered it?
[01:15:41.484 --> 01:15:42.905]  I don't know.
[01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:45.786]  That's going to be a very, very hard sell.
[01:15:45.786 --> 01:15:52.588]  It may be during that time that we may have an escalation in warfare in the Middle East as well.
[01:15:52.588 --> 01:15:55.770]  That's what Ron Paul said yesterday.
[01:15:55.770 --> 01:15:56.530]  I didn't hear that.
[01:15:57.892 --> 01:16:01.075]  Should I say great minds think in the same channels?
[01:16:01.075 --> 01:16:05.378]  But anyway, I've been saying it for weeks and I'm sure he has too.
[01:16:05.378 --> 01:16:25.514]  This will be a negative diversion and this will lay the seeds for, oh we gotta go do this, it's for this war effort against these terrible Muslims in Iran and Russia and the same old, same old that we went through during the Second World War and then for
[01:16:26.073 --> 01:16:26.374]  Absolutely.
[01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:34.784]  Let's talk about solutions.
[01:16:34.784 --> 01:16:42.812]  Obviously we've got to mobilize at the grassroots, get the word out that it is the bankers that engineered this and that they are only going to continue to bankrupt us.
[01:16:42.812 --> 01:16:46.215]  You know, they said four months ago, give us unlimited power and we'll save you.
[01:16:46.215 --> 01:16:48.778]  The next day they said, we're keeping all the money.
[01:16:48.778 --> 01:16:52.061]  Now they're saying, give us world government power and we'll save you.
[01:16:52.061 --> 01:16:56.365]  We've got to get the message out to the people that these are criminals, but how do we stop the executive
[01:16:57.435 --> 01:17:09.366]  Through dictatorial measures in Europe, in England, in the United States, in Australia, in Japan, ignoring the fact that 95-98% of people are against this in every poll, thousand to one phone calls to Congress.
[01:17:09.366 --> 01:17:15.913]  It looks like they're just going to do it and then count on the NORTHCOM option to suppress the population.
[01:17:15.913 --> 01:17:16.914]  I think you're right.
[01:17:16.914 --> 01:17:22.499]  And I think they're in for a surprise because I don't think the NORTHCOM operation is going to work.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:29.982]  And in Europe, you're going to get a different response.
[01:17:29.982 --> 01:17:36.224]  You're going to get perpetual demonstrations and rioting because by and large, they have no weapons.
[01:17:36.224 --> 01:17:37.845]  In America, it's different.
[01:17:37.845 --> 01:17:45.367]  In fact, America is the only place in the world where people, generally speaking, can have weapons.
[01:17:45.367 --> 01:17:48.108]  There are countries where you can have them via registration.
[01:17:48.618 --> 01:17:50.119]  That very few people have them.
[01:17:50.119 --> 01:17:53.782]  There's not that many in this.
[01:17:53.782 --> 01:17:57.626]  And the United States has the history of being very violent, piratical people.
[01:17:57.626 --> 01:17:58.827]  Let's just face it.
[01:17:58.827 --> 01:18:00.108]  We are the Motley Crue.
[01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:06.894]  Anybody, whether it was black, white, who came here, came through adversity, warfare, ongoing tribal warfare.
[01:18:06.894 --> 01:18:10.877]  I mean, that's why we're so warlike.
[01:18:10.877 --> 01:18:12.659]  And that's true.
[01:18:12.659 --> 01:18:15.261]  It is a race apart, if you can call it that.
[01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:19.087]  And they're going to have their hands full.
[01:18:19.087 --> 01:18:24.872]  I talk about this every day on the air, and this is where it's going to end up, in the streets in America.
[01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:34.820]  In the world, the way that the world is going to go will be contingent upon the success of the American people suppressing their own government.
[01:18:36.496 --> 01:18:47.978]  Well, I see them, though, playing the card of using shootouts and death and destruction as a pretext to bring in even more international control, intending for that to be a disaster.
[01:18:47.978 --> 01:18:48.959]  But that's the game.
[01:18:48.959 --> 01:18:51.939]  Just level the United States.
[01:18:51.939 --> 01:19:00.961]  Well, I think they're going to have a hard time bringing in people, troops, perhaps, from other regions, because everybody's going to have the same problems.
[01:19:00.961 --> 01:19:04.422]  And you're going to have violent people all over the world.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:05.800]  I don't
[01:19:16.388 --> 01:19:19.909]  They have a revolution in their country and there's no troops around to protect the government.
[01:19:19.909 --> 01:19:22.330]  That's not going to happen.
[01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:28.373]  Take Iceland, one of the most wealthy per capita countries, one of the most peaceable, low crime rates, good people.
[01:19:28.373 --> 01:19:35.696]  They're now two months into daily protesting and every time the cops pop off and do something to them, they just riot and defeat them.
[01:19:35.696 --> 01:19:40.298]  How long until that becomes them using machetes?
[01:19:40.298 --> 01:19:40.858]  Or something.
[01:19:42.694 --> 01:19:44.355]  Yeah, I mean, it's a disaster, folks.
[01:19:44.355 --> 01:19:46.796]  The New World Order has destroyed us.
[01:19:46.796 --> 01:19:51.958]  I mean, we are plunging into just the depths of insanity.
[01:19:51.958 --> 01:19:58.941]  Let's talk about how to protect ourselves with Bob Chapman on the other side, on the one and the only GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:00.993 --> 01:20:09.239]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:13.802]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:20:13.802 --> 01:20:18.485]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:19.886]  It's a documented fact.
[01:20:19.906 --> 01:20:20.327]  We're good to go!
[01:20:38.749 --> 01:20:39.409]  We're good to go!
[01:21:01.849 --> 01:21:05.732]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:21:05.732 --> 01:21:07.134]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:21:07.134 --> 01:21:11.017]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:21:11.017 --> 01:21:13.920]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.001]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:21:16.001 --> 01:21:18.303]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:21:19.364 --> 01:21:29.833]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:33.856]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:37.139]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:21:37.139 --> 01:21:37.479]  Call me.

[01:21:46.105 --> 01:21:46.766]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:14.161]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:22:14.161 --> 01:22:20.924]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:22:21.264 --> 01:22:25.227]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:22:25.227 --> 01:22:28.630]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:36.536]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:54.795]  We're in a no holds bar information war.
[01:22:54.795 --> 01:22:55.978]  Truth is our weapon.
[01:22:55.978 --> 01:23:00.107]  And PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:23:00.715 --> 01:23:06.196]  What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food is gone?
[01:23:06.196 --> 01:23:08.016]  How will you feed your family?
[01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:15.357]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:22.819]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.

[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:30.960]  I think so.
[01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:08.826]  Everybody knows, except for the Obama zombies and the neocon followers.
[01:24:08.826 --> 01:24:12.431]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[01:24:12.431 --> 01:24:17.999]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:24:17.999 --> 01:24:19.161]  Everybody knows.
[01:24:19.281 --> 01:24:23.462]  Unless you understand the game and prepare for it.
[01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:47.313]  And it's still not too late.
[01:24:47.313 --> 01:24:51.960]  With Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com joining us.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:56.807]  Formerly the largest newsletter in the world until he retired for a few years, came back.
[01:24:56.807 --> 01:24:59.871]  Formerly the biggest gold and silver broker individually in the world.
[01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:06.036]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up, the owner of the Genesis Network, in the gold and silver business for 30 years.
[01:25:06.036 --> 01:25:09.078]  They've been trying to suppress the price of gold, but it's way up again this week.
[01:25:09.078 --> 01:25:10.639]  Ted bought it when it was a lot lower.
[01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:17.184]  He can pass on those savings, and he's got a quick offer for you today on gold and silver coins.
[01:25:17.184 --> 01:25:25.670]  But before we go to Ted here for a moment, Bob Chapman, how important is it now, before the true hyperinflation sets in, to get into gold and silver?
[01:25:30.803 --> 01:25:39.609]  Explanation other than the fact that you must do it if you want to be able to stay out of financial harm's way.
[01:25:39.609 --> 01:25:45.373]  In the 1930s, everything went down 60 to 90 percent.
[01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:46.273]  Gold did not.
[01:25:46.273 --> 01:25:47.634]  It went up.
[01:25:47.634 --> 01:25:52.998]  And so with that said, I think the only place to be is in gold.
[01:25:52.998 --> 01:25:58.882]  Ultimately, silver is good, but it performs a somewhat different function.
[01:25:58.882 --> 01:26:00.283]  But you've got to get in now.
[01:26:00.802 --> 01:26:05.684]  Before the thing takes off because it's been suppressed by the government.
[01:26:05.684 --> 01:26:09.405]  They started doing this in 1966.
[01:26:09.405 --> 01:26:13.246]  And in a very, very serious way starting in 1988.
[01:26:13.246 --> 01:26:18.548]  And gold today should be selling at least at $2,000 an ounce.
[01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:20.088]  And it's not.
[01:26:20.088 --> 01:26:25.610]  Today it's selling somewhere in the vicinity of perhaps $860 an ounce.
[01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:26.530]  Yeah, it's $850, $750.
[01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:28.931]  And so we've got a long way to go.
[01:26:29.764 --> 01:26:39.232]  Let me just say this, ladies and gentlemen, not only do you need gold and silver, you need to get it from a place that has fabulous deals because it's a big outfit, been in business for decades, and has the sources.
[01:26:39.232 --> 01:26:43.196]  A lot of places are sold out, or one coin per person at huge premiums.
[01:26:43.196 --> 01:26:46.559]  Not the case with Ted Anderson and Minus Resources.
[01:26:46.559 --> 01:26:49.141]  Ted, tell folks the offer you've got today.
[01:26:49.141 --> 01:26:50.062]  Yeah, yeah, Alex.
[01:26:50.062 --> 01:26:55.807]  Actually, I wouldn't have priced out what it would be to replace these coins right now if I entered into the marketplace at today's prices.
[01:26:56.385 --> 01:26:58.566]  I have the Franks right now at $2.02.
[01:26:58.566 --> 01:27:00.127]  That coin right now would be $2.12.
[01:27:00.127 --> 01:27:02.788]  I have the British Sovereign right now at $2.50.
[01:27:02.788 --> 01:27:05.209]  That coin right now would be $2.59.
[01:27:05.209 --> 01:27:12.493]  One of the things I'm getting my hands on right now is the Buffalo coin, and I think that's just a fabulous coin because it's so hard to get.
[01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:13.573]  But right now I have them at $1,036.
[01:27:13.573 --> 01:27:15.254]  You know, I watched that Beck interview too.
[01:27:15.254 --> 01:27:16.555]  He's talking about a 70% increase in M3.
[01:27:22.199 --> 01:27:30.273]  I'm looking around to see what supports those numbers, but I know that the money supply has gone up like crazy, and the Fed's not going to tell us what the numbers are anymore.
[01:27:30.273 --> 01:27:30.995]  They don't do that.
[01:27:34.066 --> 01:27:40.230]  Well, again, that's an incredible deal on the Franks and the Sovereigns right down at bullion prices, and you've got them in stock.
[01:27:40.230 --> 01:27:42.312]  The Buffalos are at huge premiums everywhere else.
[01:27:42.312 --> 01:27:44.693]  That has a small premium, but it's the best deal you'll find.
[01:27:44.693 --> 01:27:46.294]  I challenge you to look.
[01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:49.056]  Ladies and gentlemen, give Midas Resources a call at 800-686-2237.
[01:27:49.056 --> 01:27:54.720]  800-686-2237.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.461]  What silver do you have, Ted?
[01:27:56.461 --> 01:27:59.003]  Yeah, the silver right now is the walking Liberty Half still.
[01:27:59.003 --> 01:28:01.385]  I mean, you can get into the dollars, and they're trading right around 20 bucks.
[01:28:02.435 --> 01:28:09.042]  But you can get into the Walking Liberty Halves, and they're currently at $8.40, which puts them down to $16.80.
[01:28:09.042 --> 01:28:15.930]  That's $1.60 per ounce, or per half ounce less than what you're paying with the full dollars.
[01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:16.390]  Yeah, right.
[01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:22.517]  It's a much better buy, and at this particular time, if you don't have silver, you better get into it, because it is the poor man's money.
[01:28:22.857 --> 01:28:26.939]  When it comes down to buying groceries and gas, you need that silver.
[01:28:26.939 --> 01:28:29.240]  And this isn't a panacea, but it's the best bet out there.
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:40.766]  It's what the elite's doing, going into these insane times where they're devaluing the currency on top of a depression on Main Street, killing the real economy, shutting off liquidity to everybody else, only giving it to the elites so they can buy everything up.
[01:28:40.766 --> 01:28:41.747]  That's what's happening.
[01:28:41.747 --> 01:28:43.067]  Hyperstag inflation, 800-686-2237.
[01:28:43.067 --> 01:28:45.088]  Are those good deals, Bob Chapman?
[01:28:45.088 --> 01:28:45.929]  They certainly are.
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:55.783]  And hopefully Ted can go out and get some more for the people who call in to Midas.
[01:28:55.783 --> 01:28:58.885]  And you've got to buy at these prices.
[01:28:58.885 --> 01:29:01.126]  They're not going to stay here long.
[01:29:01.126 --> 01:29:14.314]  And we've got UBS and Citi Group and JP Morgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, all calling for higher gold prices, anywhere from $900 to $2,000 over the next year or two.
[01:29:18.257 --> 01:29:24.180]  And, you know, they're not pro-gold, believe me.
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:28.281]  And so they know it's going up.
[01:29:28.281 --> 01:29:28.401]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:28.401 --> 01:29:32.083]  800-686-2237 or minusresources.com or GCNlive.com to link through.
[01:29:32.083 --> 01:29:32.683]  Stay there, Bob.
[01:29:32.683 --> 01:29:41.387]  I want to talk to you a little bit more about why they raided 19,000 plus Swiss bank accounts in UBS alone two weeks ago and what that signifies.
[01:29:41.387 --> 01:29:42.887]  And I want to get Ted's take on it.
[01:29:42.887 --> 01:29:44.368]  Then Joe Rogan's going to be in studio.
[01:29:44.368 --> 01:29:44.868]  Stay with us.
[01:29:44.868 --> 01:29:45.909]  Then the Austin Police Chief.
[01:29:51.354 --> 01:29:55.295]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.295 --> 01:30:01.396]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:05.957]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.

[01:31:01.346 --> 01:31:08.050]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:09.711]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:10.683 --> 01:31:12.224]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:12.224 --> 01:31:13.044]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:13.044 --> 01:31:14.025]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:14.025 --> 01:31:15.406]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.406 --> 01:31:17.387]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.387 --> 01:31:24.531]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.531 --> 01:31:25.011]  Some U.S.
[01:31:25.011 --> 01:31:30.655]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.355 --> 01:31:34.876]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:34.876 --> 01:31:37.677]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:01.428 --> 01:32:03.329]  These are strange new days.
[01:32:03.329 --> 01:32:05.230]  Foreclosures are at record highs.
[01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:06.911]  People are losing their jobs.
[01:32:06.911 --> 01:32:09.152]  The threat of a terrorist attack looms.
[01:32:09.152 --> 01:32:11.514]  Food supplies are at an all-time low.
[01:32:11.514 --> 01:32:13.835]  And now we have a new untested president.
[01:32:13.835 --> 01:32:15.616]  The time of change is upon us.
[01:32:15.616 --> 01:32:20.319]  And to those of you who are in the know, you realize that the most difficult times have yet to be seen.
[01:32:20.939 --> 01:32:21.400]  I think so.
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:41.781]  We're good.
[01:33:06.056 --> 01:33:12.459]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:12.459 --> 01:33:25.924]  You know, a lot of people in the Patriot Movement and the Anti-Federal Reserve Movement, the Libertarian Movement, the Bonn Mies crowd and others, they're all for gold and silver, but they're also for offshore banks, where it's not even money laundering or anything criminal.
[01:33:25.924 --> 01:33:29.386]  You just put gold or silver in Luxembourg or Switzerland or the Bahamas,
[01:33:30.566 --> 01:33:41.993]  But the OECD has been calling those tax havens in decades ago, and I first started researching, said their main goal was to shut those down for the general public and the nouveau riche, the new wealth.
[01:33:41.993 --> 01:33:44.955]  The elite are allowed to.
[01:33:44.955 --> 01:33:51.038]  19,000 plus smaller accounts totaling around, what, $12 billion.
[01:33:53.038 --> 01:33:56.940]  was grabbed out of UBS alone, and they've indicted the U.S.
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:59.681]  head of it, the big Swiss bank UBS.
[01:33:59.681 --> 01:34:05.563]  That happened two weeks ago, and this is what I keep telling people, you know, keep your silver in a vault in Europe.
[01:34:05.563 --> 01:34:06.603]  Keep your gold in a vault.
[01:34:06.603 --> 01:34:10.785]  No, keep it wherever you think it's safe, near at hand.
[01:34:10.785 --> 01:34:12.326]  People say, well, they could still come take it.
[01:34:12.326 --> 01:34:13.966]  Yeah, they could come blow your head off.
[01:34:13.966 --> 01:34:15.707]  They could come put you in a FEMA camp.
[01:34:15.707 --> 01:34:20.269]  They could throw you in a fiery furnace with, I mean, they could do whatever.
[01:34:21.377 --> 01:34:27.182]  So, and I mean that sarcastically, the point here is that we're telling you what the elites do.
[01:34:27.182 --> 01:34:30.024]  We're telling you the safest bet here.
[01:34:30.024 --> 01:34:34.827]  Safest bet by a long shot is gold and silver and getting it at great prices.
[01:34:34.827 --> 01:34:38.810]  So that's the bottom line here that I'm breaking down for everybody.
[01:34:39.871 --> 01:34:59.124]  Today so I want to get Bob Chapman and then Ted's take on this because they say they're going after all the major tax havens But then when I study things we know that's not true the billionaire level elites They've got their money in there in their own central bank institutions, and it grips above the Swiss bank account or private numbered account Level so a Bob Chapman.
[01:34:59.124 --> 01:35:04.508]  What does it signify that the elites are now going after the nouveau riche accounts?
[01:35:04.508 --> 01:35:09.331]  They've been doing it and very very strongly for the last 10 years
[01:35:10.692 --> 01:35:14.695]  Most jurisdictions have effectively been shut down.
[01:35:14.695 --> 01:35:20.638]  If you open an account outside the United States, even if you have more than one passport, and one of them happens to be a U.S.
[01:35:20.638 --> 01:35:25.341]  passport, they want you to sign a W-9, and they turn it over to the U.S.
[01:35:25.341 --> 01:35:26.382]  government.
[01:35:26.382 --> 01:35:31.325]  And the reason is so that you couldn't avoid taxation if that was an event.
[01:35:31.325 --> 01:35:34.066]  And also, they want to know where your money is.
[01:35:34.066 --> 01:35:36.448]  And this is really what this is all about.
[01:35:36.448 --> 01:35:38.629]  They want to be able to control your money.
[01:35:39.232 --> 01:35:43.255]  No matter where it is in the world, if they would like to control it.
[01:35:43.255 --> 01:35:45.057]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:35:45.057 --> 01:35:51.622]  The collective information, first with Americans and Europeans and then the rest of the world.
[01:35:51.622 --> 01:35:54.304]  And they totally intend to do that.
[01:35:54.304 --> 01:35:57.326]  Whether they're going to get away with it or not remains to be seen.
[01:35:57.326 --> 01:36:07.554]  And that's why, and I know Ted as he feels the same way, I have told people for the last 49 years, if you buy gold and silver coins, you take delivery.
[01:36:09.534 --> 01:36:10.095]  Ted Anderson?
[01:36:19.042 --> 01:36:21.023]  That's not going to be useful to you.
[01:36:21.023 --> 01:36:30.589]  If the economy fails and you have your gold stored offshore, overseas, in some bank, you know, all you have is a certificate.
[01:36:30.589 --> 01:36:36.592]  It's going to be like you're going to be hungry and you want to eat and all you have is a pitcher of a can of beans rather than having the can of beans.
[01:36:36.592 --> 01:36:41.715]  You need the gold and silver in your possession, not sitting in some hand somewhere else.
[01:36:41.715 --> 01:36:42.716]  Beside the fact
[01:36:43.251 --> 01:36:49.776]  Every single one of these nations that you mentioned, Alex, are all relying on a fiat currency.
[01:36:49.776 --> 01:36:50.516]  Every single one.
[01:36:50.516 --> 01:36:59.682]  When you see the G7 get together, it isn't the figureheads of the politicians getting together, it's the central banks.
[01:36:59.682 --> 01:37:06.447]  And each one of those central banks are printing money for nothing, and they're lending it to these people, and we have to service the interest on that debt.
[01:37:06.807 --> 01:37:10.252]  It's just as bad in Europe as it is here in the United States.
[01:37:10.252 --> 01:37:11.433]  It's not any different.
[01:37:11.433 --> 01:37:16.400]  You need to have something real solid and that you can trust and rely upon.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.721]  And people in Europe know this.
[01:37:17.721 --> 01:37:23.349]  Alex, I got people calling me from everywhere across the entire globe buying gold and silver.
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:25.341]  Everybody knows they need it.
[01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:27.382]  You can't trust any one of these currencies.
[01:37:27.382 --> 01:37:29.943]  It's like this New World Order organization.
[01:37:29.943 --> 01:37:33.764]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you what the elites have.
[01:37:33.764 --> 01:37:42.388]  They own real estate, they have power, they have their own mercenaries, but the main thing they hoard is gold, silver, jewels, and fine art, because that's the only real currency they can carry with them.
[01:37:42.388 --> 01:37:43.869]  They can haul around with them.
[01:37:43.869 --> 01:37:47.711]  And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, you need to get into gold and silver right now with those deals Ted offered.
[01:37:47.711 --> 01:37:47.751]  800-686-2237.
[01:37:51.912 --> 01:37:52.993]  686-2237.
[01:37:52.993 --> 01:37:54.974]  I always spring this on Bob.
[01:37:54.974 --> 01:37:59.036]  People can also go to TheInternationalForecaster.com and get a free trial subscription of that.
[01:37:59.036 --> 01:38:05.499]  Bob, also tell folks the toll-free number they can call to get a trial free subscription of the hard copy.
[01:38:05.499 --> 01:38:06.120]  That number is 877-479-8178.
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.381]  That's 877 toll-free, 479-8178 or TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:38:20.854 --> 01:38:25.255]  International, F-O-R-E-C-A-S-T-E-R dot com.
[01:38:25.255 --> 01:38:45.820]  Alright, and in closing to both of you men, I know we've known they were sending up a world government, we knew how they would do it, we knew how they'd implode the economy, have a global crisis, bring in the world banking system publicly as the government to pay carbon taxes to, but now to see the White House, put it on WhiteHouse.gov last night, to see Geithner openly proposing it, to see it in Newsweek,
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:39:12.350]  To see it in Time Magazine, to see it in all these papers, saying it's, I mean, it's still hard for me to believe we're now here, all these decades of talk, all the preparation, we are now entering the final phase of the New World Order, and we, this is the time when we can actually defeat them, this is the key point, and so, so, I mean, what is it like to see, with you 45 plus years, with you 30 years, Ted, of fighting this, to now see it actually here?
[01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:13.210]  And to be vindicated?
[01:39:14.554 --> 01:39:17.197]  Well, okay, I'll jump in there.
[01:39:17.197 --> 01:39:17.698]  Go ahead.
[01:39:17.698 --> 01:39:23.606]  Yeah, okay, I was just about to say, in my time, I can tell you right now, Alex, that people have never been so hungry for the truth.
[01:39:24.549 --> 01:39:25.570]  Than they are right now.
[01:39:25.570 --> 01:39:28.291]  I've never seen it come to a head like this.
[01:39:28.291 --> 01:39:35.154]  I knew it was going to happen, but I didn't know it was going to happen even in my lifetime that it was going to come to this.
[01:39:35.154 --> 01:39:37.975]  And it's interesting to have people opening their eyes.
[01:39:37.975 --> 01:39:45.718]  I'm hitting just about everybody, everywhere in radio with Creature from Jekyll Island ads, with Bob Chapman's newsletter ads.
[01:39:45.718 --> 01:39:49.880]  I'm trying to feed them the information that will give them the answers that they're so hungry for.
[01:39:50.307 --> 01:39:56.550]  Because the baloney that's coming from the mainstream media is not answering their questions.
[01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:57.751]  They know what they want.
[01:39:57.751 --> 01:39:58.531]  Absolutely.
[01:39:58.531 --> 01:40:07.936]  I got Joe Rogan about to come in studio if we play this clip about the poison light bulbs they're making everybody take with mercury and lead, but also the cell phone type radiation they're putting off.
[01:40:07.936 --> 01:40:12.119]  That's coming up in a moment, but Bob, comment on that and we're going to let you guys go.
[01:40:12.119 --> 01:40:18.342]  They've opened a window of opportunity for themselves to implement world currency and world government.
[01:40:18.769 --> 01:40:25.435]  But it also, that when that window's open, it gives us the opportunity to do exactly what Alex is talking about.
[01:40:25.435 --> 01:40:31.780]  We gotta hit them, hit them, and hit them with the truth by getting to the public and letting the public know what they're up to.
[01:40:37.055 --> 01:40:39.036]  Yes, we've got to carry the ball.
[01:40:39.036 --> 01:40:42.059]  This is an opportunity for them, an opportunity for liberty.
[01:40:42.059 --> 01:40:45.022]  This is the time for the maximum effort, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:45.022 --> 01:40:46.323]  Look, Obama's even said it.
[01:40:46.323 --> 01:40:47.244]  The White House has said it.
[01:40:47.244 --> 01:40:49.987]  They've got 200 days to ram through the total world government.
[01:40:50.467 --> 01:40:51.767]  They know it's unpopular.
[01:40:51.767 --> 01:40:52.628]  Biden has said it.
[01:40:52.628 --> 01:40:54.048]  We can defeat it.
[01:40:54.048 --> 01:40:55.189]  Again, call Ted Anderson.
[01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:57.809]  Call Minus Resources to protect yourselves with precious metals.
[01:40:57.809 --> 01:40:57.930]  800-686-2237.
[01:40:57.930 --> 01:40:58.170]  800-686-2237.
[01:40:58.170 --> 01:41:00.770]  Bob Chapman, Ted Anderson, we'll talk to you both very soon.
[01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:01.151]  God bless.
[01:41:01.151 --> 01:41:01.411]  Bye-bye.
[01:41:01.411 --> 01:41:01.811]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[01:41:09.179 --> 01:41:09.299]  800-686-2237.
[01:41:09.299 --> 01:41:36.700]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus five minutes with Joe Rogan, my good buddy, in studio to talk about a host of issues with him for the next hour and fifteen minutes and then we've got the Austin Police Chief in studio to talk about a host of important issues as well dealing with the police state and does the Austin Police Chief support the feds now charging thousands of people a month with terrorism charges for things like spanking their children or spilling a Bloody Mary on an airplane?
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:37.720]  I'm not kidding.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.061]  We're going to be talking about that coming up.
[01:41:39.061 --> 01:41:42.782]  But first, this is a mainline TV news report.
[01:41:42.782 --> 01:41:52.806]  And I just want to play a clip of it just to say this is what real news is like because they admit that the level of electromagnetic radiation coming off these new light bulbs, the lead, the mercury in them,
[01:41:53.326 --> 01:42:00.973]  It is so deadly, it is so bad for you, and this is what the internationalists have standardized worldwide to make the law that people must use.
[01:42:00.973 --> 01:42:07.758]  So let's play this clip, and then we'll go live, simulcasting in five minutes, not just on the radio, but also at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:42:07.758 --> 01:42:10.000]  So folks, go over to PrisonPlanet.tv, log on.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.542]  Everybody, start your engines.
[01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:13.383]  Joe Rogan in T-minus five minutes.
[01:42:13.383 --> 01:42:13.864]  Stay with us.
[01:42:14.724 --> 01:42:19.746]  So I told you how these energy-saving light bulbs may be causing skin rashes in some people.
[01:42:19.746 --> 01:42:23.187]  But that's not the only potential problem we've uncovered.
[01:42:23.187 --> 01:42:26.629]  Just listen to what others say is happening to them.
[01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:33.412]  Here's Part 2, Dirty Energy.
[01:42:33.412 --> 01:42:37.993]  This is reading 580, roughly.
[01:42:37.993 --> 01:42:40.034]  So, once again, we have a really bad bulb.
[01:42:40.034 --> 01:42:41.635]  What exactly is she doing?
[01:42:42.213 --> 01:42:47.917]  Well, this is Dr. Magda Havis, and she's testing all sorts of bulbs for dirty electricity.
[01:42:47.917 --> 01:42:49.218]  Dirty what?
[01:42:49.218 --> 01:42:51.200]  Dirty electricity.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:57.304]  An expert in her field, basically she measures power quality and radio frequencies that different bulbs give off.
[01:42:57.304 --> 01:43:01.147]  Do you see that's jumped up to over 400.
[01:43:01.147 --> 01:43:03.849]  So just one light bulb can give very, very high readings.
[01:43:03.849 --> 01:43:07.332]  And there's no way of knowing that this is worse than the others just by looking at the package.
[01:43:08.672 --> 01:43:15.514]  She says on her meter, for a bulb to be considered clean, it should read less than 50.
[01:43:15.514 --> 01:43:19.555]  A lot of people are responding negatively to these light bulbs.
[01:43:19.555 --> 01:43:20.435]  They get headaches.
[01:43:20.435 --> 01:43:23.456]  They get other body aches and pains.
[01:43:23.456 --> 01:43:25.396]  Some of them have difficulty sleeping.
[01:43:25.396 --> 01:43:27.036]  They're tired.
[01:43:27.036 --> 01:43:28.457]  Some have mood disorders.
[01:43:28.457 --> 01:43:34.298]  Unfortunately, they have been told that these light bulbs might be making people in their homes sick.
[01:43:34.298 --> 01:43:36.219]  So one light bulb gives 500.
[01:43:36.219 --> 01:43:38.219]  Can you imagine just two of them, four of them?
[01:43:39.073 --> 01:43:39.993]  We put them over at 2,000.
[01:43:39.993 --> 01:43:44.295]  Can I turn it off now?
[01:43:44.295 --> 01:43:46.256]  All this is controversial.
[01:43:46.256 --> 01:43:52.519]  Scientists do not agree if people can suffer from what's called electromagnetic hypersensitivity.
[01:43:52.519 --> 01:43:57.962]  Basically, getting sick from the electronic devices we use and the stuff they give off.
[01:43:57.962 --> 01:44:02.203]  But what about the people we met who say they're suffering, like Larry Newman?
[01:44:02.203 --> 01:44:04.184]  I was just blindsided by it.
[01:44:04.184 --> 01:44:05.585]  Here's the thing about Larry Newman.
[01:44:06.024 --> 01:44:11.950]  He's Dr. Newman, a neurologist, and that migraine headache hit him like a truck.
[01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:17.617]  I can tell you from my experience, there is something about those bulbs that triggered my headache.
[01:44:17.617 --> 01:44:22.982]  At his New York clinic, he's seeing more and more patients complaining about the compact fluorescent light bulbs.
[01:44:22.982 --> 01:44:26.967]  These new light bulbs, Doc, they're giving, I swear they're giving me headaches.
[01:44:26.967 --> 01:44:28.168]  So I want you to look.
[01:44:28.885 --> 01:44:29.666]  Right over there.
[01:44:29.666 --> 01:44:31.767]  He knows some will dismiss what he's saying.
[01:44:31.767 --> 01:44:35.409]  They'll say there's no scientific evidence linking the bulbs to headaches.
[01:44:35.409 --> 01:44:36.610]  It's never been proven.
[01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:43.455]  I can tell you from other patients that they definitely see a relationship to exposure to that light bulb and developing a headache.
[01:44:44.013 --> 01:44:48.176]  We just installed a new light that unfortunately is not eco-friendly.
[01:44:48.176 --> 01:44:50.178]  One of those patients is Amanda Gabbard.
[01:44:50.178 --> 01:44:59.606]  Right here, it's like just my forehead feels very warm and I feel the dull pain behind my eyes, a little bit of dizziness and a little bit of fatigue.
[01:45:00.592 --> 01:45:04.174]  In her home, you'll only find old-fashioned incandescents.
[01:45:04.174 --> 01:45:06.115]  She got rid of the CFLs.
[01:45:06.115 --> 01:45:07.536]  I'm very confused by it.
[01:45:07.536 --> 01:45:09.437]  It's kind of mind-boggling.
[01:45:09.437 --> 01:45:10.777]  I think it was just a light bulb.
[01:45:10.777 --> 01:45:11.498]  What can it really do?
[01:45:11.498 --> 01:45:13.139]  And isn't it supposed to be this great thing?
[01:45:13.139 --> 01:45:17.241]  And it's eco-friendly, and it's wonderful for the environment, and everyone's doing it.
[01:45:17.241 --> 01:45:18.842]  But she can't escape it.
[01:45:18.842 --> 01:45:23.304]  When she took a trip to Italy and stayed in this hotel, her room was loaded with the curly bulbs.
[01:45:23.812 --> 01:45:24.833]  Instantly she knew.
[01:45:24.833 --> 01:45:26.654]  I thought, oh no!
[01:45:26.654 --> 01:45:28.896]  I came all the way to Europe to have this wonderful vacation.
[01:45:28.896 --> 01:45:30.177]  I thought it's going to be ruined.
[01:45:30.177 --> 01:45:31.738]  We had to take them out immediately.
[01:45:31.738 --> 01:45:45.168]  Once stores start to replace their light bulbs, and malls start to replace their light bulbs, and everybody in their homes start to replace their light bulb, there's going to be a subset of people with migraine who may not be able to venture out until they find a way around it.
[01:45:46.536 --> 01:45:54.240]  Dr. Christine Lay, a neurologist and headache expert, says people like Amanda prove it is happening and science needs to catch up.
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:59.162]  I think a lot of times things are introduced and then it's the people that will begin to say, no, wait a minute.
[01:45:59.162 --> 01:46:00.162]  Something's going on here.
[01:46:00.162 --> 01:46:00.963]  Something's not right.
[01:46:00.963 --> 01:46:07.066]  So what we hope is that as more people speak up, more scientists will begin to become involved.
[01:46:07.066 --> 01:46:09.307]  Health Canada says, yes, it's true.
[01:46:09.307 --> 01:46:12.008]  The compact fluorescents do give off radio frequencies.
[01:46:12.383 --> 01:46:18.087]  But they say the amounts are safe and thousands of times below limits that have been recommended.
[01:46:18.087 --> 01:46:23.070]  As for the lighting companies, they say their bulbs meet industry standards and are safe.
[01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:26.633]  Again, no one would talk to us on camera.
[01:46:26.633 --> 01:46:31.476]  Health Canada has a serious responsibility and they're not living up to that responsibility.
[01:46:31.476 --> 01:46:41.263]  They're right now just trying to deny that there's a problem without recognizing what they should be doing to actually investigate it rather than just deny it blindly.
[01:46:42.441 --> 01:46:45.566]  Those who suffer say their health problems are real.
[01:46:45.566 --> 01:46:47.930]  And there's more to it than just headaches.
[01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:49.572]  They were all throughout my house.
[01:46:49.572 --> 01:46:52.917]  Just about every room in my house had a bulb or two in it.
[01:46:52.917 --> 01:46:55.662]  Kevin Byrne says his pain was like having arthritis.
[01:46:56.295 --> 01:47:06.782]  So convinced dirty electricity is, well, dirty, he quit his job to test other people's homes for what he calls electrical pollution, starting with the curly bulbs.
[01:47:06.782 --> 01:47:15.767]  When you get closer to the bulb, you can see the significant electric field that these compact fluorescence bulbs throw into a room.
[01:47:15.767 --> 01:47:19.009]  Now that's measuring over a thousand volts per meter right there.
[01:47:19.009 --> 01:47:23.552]  And that electric energy is going through you, through your body, to ground.
[01:47:24.309 --> 01:47:33.153]  I know there's a lot of people that are having adverse reactions to them, headache, fatigue, the chronic pain that I felt.
[01:47:33.153 --> 01:47:38.675]  Magda says she's heard it all before, the doubts, questioning whether they're really sick.
[01:47:38.675 --> 01:47:40.636]  Well, there's definitely something there.
[01:47:40.636 --> 01:47:51.100]  I mean, one of the ways that you can determine whether or not you're sensitive to the light bulbs is if you have them in your home, simply turn them off for a few days and find out if any of your symptoms disappear, the symptoms that you're concerned about.
[01:47:52.176 --> 01:47:53.757]  Okay, let's review.
[01:47:53.757 --> 01:47:57.418]  UV, headaches, skin problems, and of course, mercury.
[01:47:57.418 --> 01:48:00.359]  So the old light bulbs are being banned in 2012.
[01:48:00.359 --> 01:48:03.240]  Manufacturers are scrambling to create new ones.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.860]  The best choice for the future may be these.
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:08.041]  LEDs, light-emitting diodes.
[01:48:13.345 --> 01:48:14.586]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[01:48:14.586 --> 01:48:16.508]  We're about to go to break here in a moment.
[01:48:16.508 --> 01:48:18.650]  Joe Rogan, my good buddy, visiting here in Austin.
[01:48:18.650 --> 01:48:20.411]  He's busy beating up the microphone right now.
[01:48:20.411 --> 01:48:22.713]  We're going to talk about a lot of stuff in the next hour and ten minutes.
[01:48:22.713 --> 01:48:23.594]  Joe, good to have you here.
[01:48:23.594 --> 01:48:24.395]  Good to be here.
[01:48:24.395 --> 01:48:25.056]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:48:25.056 --> 01:48:25.736]  What's going on?
[01:48:25.736 --> 01:48:29.059]  I like how we just shook hands, even though we've already shook hands and hugged.
[01:48:29.059 --> 01:48:30.981]  We've got to shake hands for you guys.
[01:48:30.981 --> 01:48:31.581]  Exactly.
[01:48:31.581 --> 01:48:32.763]  Very important.
[01:48:32.763 --> 01:48:34.124]  Are you saying it's bad we did that?
[01:48:34.124 --> 01:48:35.045]  No, I'm not saying it's bad.
[01:48:35.045 --> 01:48:36.486]  Joe's always, keep it real, Jones!
[01:48:36.486 --> 01:48:38.107]  Keep it real, Alex Jones!
[01:48:39.008 --> 01:48:40.229]  Fight the power!
[01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:41.669]  One day closer to victory!
[01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:43.790]  You know, Joe just can't believe I actually really like this.
[01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:44.491]  This is what I'm really like.
[01:48:44.491 --> 01:48:44.991]  Oh, I know.
[01:48:44.991 --> 01:48:45.711]  I believe you like this.
[01:48:45.711 --> 01:48:46.912]  I've known you for a long time now, man.
[01:48:46.912 --> 01:48:51.434]  You know, I was thinking, we met in 99, so this is actually 10 years.
[01:48:51.434 --> 01:48:56.297]  You remember when I did my DVD that I filmed in Austin, The Belly of the Beast?
[01:48:56.297 --> 01:48:56.377]  Yes.
[01:48:56.377 --> 01:49:00.559]  You and I wore George W. Bush masks and Herbert Walker Bush masks.
[01:49:00.559 --> 01:49:03.220]  We did a little satanic dance to show that we were satanic.
[01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:07.903]  Yeah, we went running around the grounds of the state capitol building.
[01:49:08.283 --> 01:49:09.784]  People thought we were nuts because we were.
[01:49:09.784 --> 01:49:10.884]  You know what was funny?
[01:49:10.884 --> 01:49:12.165]  That was put out on a DVD.
[01:49:12.165 --> 01:49:19.849]  I did it and people found it and said, we found secret video of Alex and Joe Rogan doing a satanic ceremony.
[01:49:19.849 --> 01:49:22.891]  We're like, this is a spoof on them, on the Bushes.
[01:49:22.891 --> 01:49:25.312]  This is a public DVD sold in stores.
[01:49:25.312 --> 01:49:30.115]  But that's how the fake conspiracy theorists that discredit me, that's how they operate.
[01:49:31.055 --> 01:49:37.777]  Fake conspiracy theorists, do you believe, are actually employed by the government to make conspiracy theorists look ridiculous?
[01:49:37.777 --> 01:49:44.319]  Like, when you read about a guy like William Cooper, like some of the stuff that he said, like, about, like, he thought that Kennedy's driver shot Kennedy.
[01:49:44.319 --> 01:49:45.099]  When it wasn't true, yeah.
[01:49:45.099 --> 01:49:46.120]  It was ridiculous!
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:49.701]  But it's, like, so crazy that everything else he says, you gotta go, what?
[01:49:49.701 --> 01:49:53.222]  Well, I don't think he was an operative, but what I think is... Maybe he's just crazy?
[01:49:53.222 --> 01:49:54.642]  I mean, he's better compared to some.
[01:49:54.642 --> 01:49:55.583]  I mean, I have documents.
[01:49:55.583 --> 01:49:56.023]  I go off...
[01:49:57.363 --> 01:49:58.443]  99% of the time, I'm not even speculating.
[01:49:58.443 --> 01:50:04.865]  I'm going to make an Alex Jones t-shirt, and it's going to say underneath it, I have documents.
[01:50:04.865 --> 01:50:05.945]  Whenever there's anything crazy.
[01:50:05.945 --> 01:50:07.886]  I have documents, ladies and gentlemen, I can show you right now.
[01:50:07.886 --> 01:50:09.666]  Let me ask you a question, though.
[01:50:09.666 --> 01:50:16.208]  There are a few hundred cases going back into the 60s, especially with COINTELPRO, where they would have activists act crazy, say crazy things.
[01:50:16.488 --> 01:50:17.109]  Of course, right?
[01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:18.931]  I mean, it's an effective way to do it.
[01:50:18.931 --> 01:50:27.381]  I mean, if you look at, like, the way arguments progress on message boards, as soon as someone believes anything wacky... Well, now CENTCOM, now the military admits that they are on the web.
[01:50:27.381 --> 01:50:27.941]  Yeah, I read that.
[01:50:27.941 --> 01:50:28.782]  I read that recently.
[01:50:28.782 --> 01:50:29.323]  It's fascinating.
[01:50:29.323 --> 01:50:30.644]  You have the documents.
[01:50:30.644 --> 01:50:31.606]  I have the documents.
[01:50:31.606 --> 01:50:32.487]  Well, you do, see?
[01:50:32.867 --> 01:50:36.808]  But it's fascinating how they have, like, directions on how to troll.
[01:50:36.808 --> 01:50:42.290]  How to troll people, how to bait them in arguments, how to respond when you're being, you know, antagonized.
[01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.930]  Yeah, that's all come out.
[01:50:42.930 --> 01:50:43.630]  That's all come out.
[01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:44.231]  It's fascinating.
[01:50:44.231 --> 01:50:46.651]  So, so, so we know that there are hundreds have been caught.
[01:50:46.651 --> 01:50:48.632]  We know CENTCOM's hired tens of thousands.
[01:50:48.632 --> 01:50:50.753]  And they even have private PR firms that do it.
[01:50:50.753 --> 01:50:52.073]  And so, yes, it is there.
[01:50:52.073 --> 01:50:56.775]  But, but more often than not, I'm sad to say, the crazies, it's just schizophrenics and people too.
[01:50:56.775 --> 01:50:58.195]  I mean, there are outright nuts.
[01:50:58.195 --> 01:50:58.815]  Stay there.
[01:50:58.815 --> 01:50:59.795]  Joe Rogan in studio.
[01:50:59.795 --> 01:51:01.076]  Ladies and gentlemen, the info war continues.
[01:51:01.536 --> 01:51:05.759]  of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:13.184]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[01:51:13.184 --> 01:51:14.805]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:51:14.805 --> 01:51:18.948]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[01:51:18.948 --> 01:51:22.790]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:27.273]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:51:27.273 --> 01:51:31.236]  Phase One is a One World Currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[01:51:31.596 --> 01:51:35.718]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[01:51:35.718 --> 01:51:40.381]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[01:51:40.381 --> 01:51:44.003]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com.

[01:51:47.705 --> 01:51:50.747]  Learn how to make your own survival foods for pennies on the dollar.
[01:51:50.747 --> 01:51:53.568]  Go to foodshortageusa.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:51:53.568 --> 01:51:53.848]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:06.745 --> 01:52:09.185]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:09.185 --> 01:52:10.906]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:10.906 --> 01:52:13.787]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:13.787 --> 01:52:17.428]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:27.077 --> 01:52:31.946]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:35.735 --> 01:52:36.976]  How dare you?
[01:52:36.976 --> 01:52:43.241]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:43.241 --> 01:52:45.722]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:45.722 --> 01:52:52.347]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:52:52.347 --> 01:52:55.449]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:52:55.449 --> 01:52:57.711]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:52:57.711 --> 01:53:00.193]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:53:01.078 --> 01:53:01.958]  You worry.
[01:53:01.958 --> 01:53:04.039]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:53:04.039 --> 01:53:06.679]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:53:06.679 --> 01:53:08.800]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:10.420]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:14.001]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:53:14.001 --> 01:53:19.242]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:53:19.242 --> 01:53:23.203]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:53:23.203 --> 01:53:24.904]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:53:24.904 --> 01:53:27.804]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:53:27.804 --> 01:53:30.745]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:53:31.243 --> 01:53:39.909]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:53:39.909 --> 01:53:44.732]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[01:53:52.658 --> 01:53:54.139]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:53:54.139 --> 01:53:55.880]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:54:02.353 --> 01:54:02.944]  I don't think.
[01:54:05.094 --> 01:54:10.016]  Alright, this hour and five minutes we've got left with Joe is just going to go by so quickly.
[01:54:10.016 --> 01:54:10.916]  So let's go ahead and get into it.
[01:54:10.916 --> 01:54:14.477]  During the breaks, we're having even more interesting discussions we're having on air.
[01:54:14.477 --> 01:54:26.061]  You were asking me, what's this Ron Paul clip I've got on the screen over here, and I was saying I played it earlier, where suddenly Glenn Beck comes out and goes, the world government's real, the international bankers are dangerous, they're more dangerous than stounding armies, you know, Thomas Jefferson quotes.
[01:54:26.061 --> 01:54:26.681]  What do we do?
[01:54:26.681 --> 01:54:28.822]  They're bankrupting us by design.
[01:54:28.822 --> 01:54:31.983]  But now he's doing it on Fox News, so that's going to discredit that message.
[01:54:32.763 --> 01:54:35.064]  But you were bringing up Ron Paul and his ideas.
[01:54:35.064 --> 01:54:36.944]  Why do you think that it discredits that message?
[01:54:36.944 --> 01:54:41.766]  I mean, if he's saying it on Fox News, maybe they're saying it because they're really worried about it now.
[01:54:41.766 --> 01:54:50.229]  Maybe it's gotten to the point where even the people that were supposedly supporting a corrupt administration are now scared that it's far more corrupt than they had ever believed.
[01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.929]  Well, let's hope so!
[01:54:51.950 --> 01:55:02.378]  When I see a guy like Glenn Beck, I think, here's a guy who wants attention, he wants to be a smart guy, he wants to be sensible, he wants to prove a point, but I feel like a lot of it's like an act.
[01:55:02.378 --> 01:55:10.144]  I feel like he's this American apple pie guy, and now I heard that he's doing some sort of a performance, where he's like, he has a live show?
[01:55:10.144 --> 01:55:10.604]  Yeah.
[01:55:10.604 --> 01:55:12.085]  And I'm like, okay, he's like an entertainer.
[01:55:12.085 --> 01:55:17.109]  Well a year ago he said, the Army needs to watch and look at and be used against Ron Paul supporters.
[01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:18.270]  But you see what I'm saying about his opinions?
[01:55:18.270 --> 01:55:20.732]  I mean, if he wants to do a live show, he's an entertainer.
[01:55:21.192 --> 01:55:25.114]  You know, I mean, that's really, I mean, no news person does a live show.
[01:55:25.114 --> 01:55:26.175]  They don't even think about that.
[01:55:26.175 --> 01:55:28.476]  So what validates his opinions?
[01:55:28.476 --> 01:55:34.100]  You know, maybe he is a guy that was on the side of it because he thought that it was the right thing to do.
[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:39.843]  Or maybe he's mixing in real issues, but then sandwiching it with more government propaganda, which he's doing.
[01:55:40.183 --> 01:55:40.864]  That could be.
[01:55:40.864 --> 01:55:48.030]  I mean, it could be that he's, you know, this is the new stance, that this is the new stance at Fox News, is they always need an army, or they always need an enemy.
[01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:56.157]  And so now, if the enemy isn't the liberals, maybe if the liberals are in charge and they've decided to work with them, now, you know, the idea is that we're supposed to be afraid of the international banks.
[01:55:56.157 --> 01:55:58.339]  But it is the international banks that orchestrated the collapse.
[01:55:59.019 --> 01:56:00.500]  I have the documents, as they say.
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:01.061]  Right.
[01:56:01.061 --> 01:56:18.114]  Do you believe that it was orchestrated, or do you believe that it was orchestrated and fell apart because of just human nature and greed and the fact that these people were willing to take these crazy loans they couldn't pay off and houses they couldn't afford and that bankers knew that these houses were just never going to just continue to appreciate.
[01:56:18.114 --> 01:56:19.576]  They were completely overinflated.
[01:56:19.576 --> 01:56:20.997]  Do you think it's a little bit of both, maybe?
[01:56:21.377 --> 01:56:30.560]  It is a little bit of both, because in the lending changes they made in the mid and late 90s, that allowed sub-brokerage in banks to run scams, and that did happen.
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:47.986]  But the large central banks, we have their own policy papers, and when I went and infiltrated Bilderberg three years ago, and it's in my film, Endgame, out for a year and a half, I said they're going to pop the subprime mortgage, create an international banking crisis, and then propose a world bank that you'll pay carbon taxes to, and that was now in Newsweek two weeks ago.
[01:56:48.086 --> 01:56:50.608]  If that happens, what happens to all the money in America?
[01:56:50.608 --> 01:56:51.769]  What's the thought behind that?
[01:56:51.769 --> 01:56:55.992]  Like everybody who has a million dollars all of a sudden has a zero and we all start at scratch?
[01:56:55.992 --> 01:57:03.498]  Well the elite have transferred the assets while they still have value into tangible hard resources and infrastructure.
[01:57:03.498 --> 01:57:06.100]  Like gold and oil and stuff like that.
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:07.681]  So is that the thought behind it?
[01:57:07.681 --> 01:57:09.362]  That they're just going to cancel out all the money?
[01:57:09.362 --> 01:57:11.164]  That they're going to completely implode the dollar?
[01:57:12.486 --> 01:57:20.929]  What they're going to do is have a world banking system, it's already there, but go public, that will set the currency values and that will control the major western governments.
[01:57:20.929 --> 01:57:24.751]  So you'll already have a world currency, but you'll still have your local unit.
[01:57:24.751 --> 01:57:29.692]  Kind of like Sports Illustrated's in 15 different regions or whatever, but it's still Sports Illustrated.
[01:57:29.692 --> 01:57:38.876]  So you'll still have a dollar, you'll still have a peso, you'll still have a pound, you'll still have a euro, but it's all going to be devalued simultaneously.
[01:57:39.156 --> 01:57:40.757]  No, okay, here's the question.
[01:57:40.757 --> 01:57:47.300]  Is there a way to stop anything like, if this is all real, if this is really what's going to happen, is there a way to stop it, or at this point in time, should it be stopped?
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:49.161]  I mean, what do you think should happen?
[01:57:49.161 --> 01:57:50.882]  Oh, it's probably going to fail.
[01:57:50.882 --> 01:57:55.865]  Even the bankers are saying in their own policy reports that are public that this is going to be a hard sell.
[01:57:55.865 --> 01:58:00.007]  So, we're going into one hell of a fight, because these guys won't give us quarter.
[01:58:01.007 --> 01:58:03.851]  I mean, they're not going to stop.
[01:58:03.851 --> 01:58:06.494]  So the bankers are saying they're not going to be able to pull it off?
[01:58:06.494 --> 01:58:08.256]  They're saying it's very hard for them.
[01:58:08.256 --> 01:58:13.784]  But now, since they built the crisis, and they're saying they have to do it or it will all fall apart.
[01:58:14.873 --> 01:58:20.635]  Is it possible to re... I mean, because of this crisis, I mean, is it possible that they could re-engineer to bring it back to life?
[01:58:20.635 --> 01:58:24.217]  Or is it just... I mean, I don't understand enough about the way the financial system works.
[01:58:24.217 --> 01:58:29.059]  No, but see, that's what's so psycho about these globalists is they've created a crisis.
[01:58:29.059 --> 01:58:30.919]  We're only going to the next Ponzi scheme.
[01:58:30.919 --> 01:58:33.140]  We'll save it, which then gives them all the power.
[01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:36.202]  So they say to the country, you better go with us or it's over.
[01:58:36.202 --> 01:58:37.622]  And in a way, it's really true.
[01:58:37.622 --> 01:58:39.463]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds with Joe Rogan.
[01:58:43.328 --> 01:58:45.829]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:57.491]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.491 --> 01:59:00.451]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.451 --> 01:59:03.492]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.492 --> 01:59:08.213]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.453 --> 01:59:09.573]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.573 --> 01:59:12.815]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.815 --> 01:59:19.798]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[01:59:53.792 --> 01:59:56.198]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.198 --> 01:59:58.984]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:03.407 --> 02:00:04.787]  All right, let's move quick, Joe.
[02:00:04.787 --> 02:00:06.748]  There's a lot going on, a lot happening.
[02:00:06.748 --> 02:00:08.528]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.528 --> 02:00:10.169]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.169 --> 02:00:12.109]  Got to let my liner finish.
[02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.770]  So does he.
[02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:17.591]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.591 --> 02:00:20.051]  And now, live from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:20.051 --> 02:00:22.552]  Yeah, it's on PrisonPlanet.tv live.
[02:00:22.552 --> 02:00:23.993]  Here we go.
[02:00:23.993 --> 02:00:26.313]  Yeah, Joe, this is streaming out on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:26.313 --> 02:00:28.214]  I think it's ripped all over the four corners of the web.
[02:00:29.867 --> 02:00:31.928]  And it's also been simulcasting on the radio.
[02:00:31.928 --> 02:00:35.090]  You've got a serious setup here, sir.
[02:00:35.090 --> 02:00:35.730]  That's pretty good.
[02:00:35.730 --> 02:00:36.771]  Thank you for liking it, though.
[02:00:36.771 --> 02:00:37.511]  It's not bad.
[02:00:37.511 --> 02:00:39.532]  Pretty sporty.
[02:00:39.532 --> 02:00:41.033]  Kubrick films playing in the background?
[02:00:41.033 --> 02:00:45.916]  It's kind of creepy.
[02:00:45.916 --> 02:00:48.357]  Well, the real world is creepy, as you know.
[02:00:48.357 --> 02:00:49.478]  The real world is creepy.
[02:00:50.956 --> 02:00:52.757]  Very, very, very creepy.
[02:00:52.757 --> 02:00:57.098]  Let's get into, first off, before we get into Ron Paul, what's some of the latest stuff you're working on?
[02:00:57.098 --> 02:00:59.899]  I mean, you're the top host, one of the founding hosts.
[02:00:59.899 --> 02:01:07.001]  We'll find out, when people ever talk about the host, they talk about you with Ultimate Fighting becoming an international super craze, just getting bigger and bigger.
[02:01:07.001 --> 02:01:08.261]  You've done all these big TV shows.
[02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:09.521]  You're just another big TV show.
[02:01:09.521 --> 02:01:10.782]  You're doing the comedian stuff.
[02:01:10.782 --> 02:01:12.122]  Tell us what Joe Rogan's up to these days.
[02:01:12.222 --> 02:01:15.886]  Well, I mean, primarily my job is always a stand-up comic.
[02:01:15.886 --> 02:01:16.886]  I mean, that's really what I do.
[02:01:16.886 --> 02:01:19.069]  Everything else, you know, I kind of do for money.
[02:01:19.069 --> 02:01:24.734]  The UFC is, you know, my big gig, and that's just an awesome job.
[02:01:24.734 --> 02:01:25.715]  I mean, I just love doing that.
[02:01:25.715 --> 02:01:26.636]  I love doing commentary.
[02:01:26.636 --> 02:01:27.677]  I'm a huge fan of the sport.
[02:01:28.177 --> 02:01:33.100]  And then I do little things on the side sometimes, like I just did this thing for CBS called Game Show in My Head.
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.201]  It's like a hidden camera comedy game show.
[02:01:35.201 --> 02:01:38.263]  We did eight of them and they're airing all throughout January.
[02:01:38.263 --> 02:01:39.684]  It's actually pretty funny.
[02:01:39.684 --> 02:01:43.907]  It's a hidden camera comedy game show where they have to do these crazy things.
[02:01:43.907 --> 02:01:48.149]  They have a earpiece in and I'm talking to them and there's hidden cameras everywhere.
[02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:53.773]  So, but I think we did eight of those, so I think it's done at the end of this month.
[02:01:53.953 --> 02:01:55.853]  But I remember you saying that about Fear Factor.
[02:01:55.853 --> 02:02:00.694]  You go, oh, I did this, I don't even really want to do it, I'm just doing a lot of things, I don't think this is going to go.
[02:02:00.694 --> 02:02:02.275]  That's what I thought.
[02:02:02.275 --> 02:02:04.595]  When I was first doing it, I was like, this thing's so stupid.
[02:02:04.595 --> 02:02:07.136]  I was just going to last.
[02:02:07.136 --> 02:02:09.096]  It lasted for six years, you know?
[02:02:09.096 --> 02:02:15.138]  I mean, shows like that are, you know, if you have a skill, if you're a good host, if you know how to host those shows, they're fun to do.
[02:02:15.138 --> 02:02:15.618]  They're easy.
[02:02:15.618 --> 02:02:16.938]  Well, you did Mad TV, too.
[02:02:17.398 --> 02:02:17.959]  No, I didn't.
[02:02:17.959 --> 02:02:20.162]  I just did a guest appearance on MattTV.
[02:02:20.162 --> 02:02:21.344]  But then also NewsRadio?
[02:02:21.344 --> 02:02:22.205]  Yeah, NewsRadio.
[02:02:22.205 --> 02:02:24.428]  What was your favorite show you've ever done?
[02:02:24.428 --> 02:02:28.714]  NewsRadio was the most fun creatively because it was a comedy.
[02:02:28.714 --> 02:02:31.197]  It was really fun to do and it was, you know, really interesting.
[02:02:31.197 --> 02:02:32.078]  It was real acting?
[02:02:32.078 --> 02:02:32.198]  Yeah.
[02:02:32.719 --> 02:02:35.742]  Well, I mean, you know, acting's not that hard.
[02:02:35.742 --> 02:02:38.825]  Especially sitcom acting, you know, it's really easy.
[02:02:38.825 --> 02:02:49.536]  But it was a really unique opportunity to work with a bunch of really talented people, like Phil Hartman, and Dave Foley, and Andy Dick, and all the people that were on that show were just really talented, you know, Maura Tierney.
[02:02:49.536 --> 02:02:56.663]  And it's because of that, you know, I got to really appreciate, like, the craft of creating, like, a good television show.
[02:02:57.003 --> 02:02:58.604]  So it makes it hard to do another one afterwards.
[02:02:58.604 --> 02:03:03.727]  That's why, in a sense, that Fear Factor was a good thing to do, because it was way better to do that than a crappy sitcom.
[02:03:03.727 --> 02:03:07.930]  It's like, let's just do this goofy game show, you know, that's not really supposed to be a comedy.
[02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:13.371]  It never happens unless we have a big guest in studio.
[02:03:13.371 --> 02:03:14.672]  We have multiple backup lines.
[02:03:14.672 --> 02:03:17.873]  Our connection to the satellite just cut out, but we have backups to the satellite.
[02:03:17.873 --> 02:03:19.113]  You have backups to the satellite?
[02:03:19.113 --> 02:03:22.075]  So the connection cut out and you think that it's the government that's doing this?
[02:03:22.075 --> 02:03:22.675]  No, no.
[02:03:22.675 --> 02:03:25.636]  It only happens if I have Ron Paul or Jesse Ventura in studio.
[02:03:25.636 --> 02:03:27.397]  It only happens if Charlie Sheen's on.
[02:03:27.397 --> 02:03:29.278]  We probably have one of those guests every month.
[02:03:29.278 --> 02:03:31.279]  And it only happens when a big guest is on generally.
[02:03:31.279 --> 02:03:34.680]  Well, I'm far less threatening than any of those gentlemen.
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:36.941]  We have four backups to the satellite, so we're fine.
[02:03:36.941 --> 02:03:38.021]  You need not worry about me.
[02:03:38.021 --> 02:03:38.682]  I'm a comedian.
[02:03:41.972 --> 02:03:47.035]  Uh, but your real passion is the, uh, the stand-up.
[02:03:47.035 --> 02:03:49.796]  Yeah, stand-up is, uh, well, stand-up is everything.
[02:03:49.796 --> 02:03:51.877]  Stand-up to me is, uh, you know, it's life.
[02:03:51.877 --> 02:04:00.122]  It's like your perception of life, you know, and it's the most fun, it's the most, uh, to do it as an art form, it's the most rewarding.
[02:04:00.122 --> 02:04:01.523]  I mean, you're making people feel better.
[02:04:01.523 --> 02:04:07.986]  You, like, you get in front of a room full of people and you make them, literally, their physical state changes and they have a great time and they enjoy it.
[02:04:07.986 --> 02:04:09.667]  And you're kind of getting high off that energy, aren't you?
[02:04:09.948 --> 02:04:15.721]  Yeah, definitely, and I think it also, not only does it do that, I think it enhances your life.
[02:04:15.721 --> 02:04:19.429]  Because I think, without sounding like, you know, gay and hippie,
[02:04:20.345 --> 02:04:26.108]  Well, you know, what you put out, when you put out positive energy, I think, you know, you get positive energy back.
[02:04:26.108 --> 02:04:27.168]  I think that's real.
[02:04:27.168 --> 02:04:40.755]  And I think that living your life, like, making people laugh, and having a good time, and doing stand-up comedy, and traveling all around the world doing that, it's like, you're pumping out a lot of positive energy, and I think that... Hold on, it sounds like ice cream trucks, is what Willie Nelson says.
[02:04:40.755 --> 02:04:41.555]  It is like ice cream trucks.
[02:04:41.935 --> 02:04:43.017]  Well, hold on.
[02:04:43.017 --> 02:04:44.499]  It's Christmas out there.
[02:04:44.499 --> 02:04:45.220]  Stay there, Joe.
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:45.620]  Quick break.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:45.941]  Come back.
[02:04:45.941 --> 02:04:47.243]  Long segment.
[02:04:47.243 --> 02:04:48.624]  Plenty of time.
[02:04:48.624 --> 02:04:50.026]  Plenty of time to get back to the ice cream.
[02:04:50.026 --> 02:04:51.729]  Get closer to victory, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:51.729 --> 02:04:52.570]  Ice Cream Trucks.
[02:04:52.570 --> 02:04:53.050]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:01.352 --> 02:05:05.055]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[02:05:05.055 --> 02:05:10.781]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[02:05:10.781 --> 02:05:15.124]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[02:05:15.124 --> 02:05:17.587]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[02:05:17.587 --> 02:05:23.552]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[02:05:23.612 --> 02:05:24.072]  I don't know.
[02:05:46.562 --> 02:05:47.523]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:05:47.523 --> 02:05:49.204]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:05:49.204 --> 02:05:50.485]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:05:50.485 --> 02:05:53.707]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:05:53.707 --> 02:05:55.209]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[02:06:14.523 --> 02:06:18.045]  Accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:06:18.045 --> 02:06:22.307]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:30.551]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:07:11.374 --> 02:07:12.314]  Are your kids safe when
[02:07:30.663 --> 02:07:34.385]  Your keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[02:07:34.385 --> 02:07:43.050]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.

[02:08:02.176 --> 02:08:04.941]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.941 --> 02:08:07.746]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:12.717]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:08:12.717 --> 02:08:19.719]  We just got confirmation Alex Jones will be with me at one of these shows this weekend, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:19.719 --> 02:08:20.660]  I don't know which one.
[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:23.040]  But you're not going to embarrass me calling me up there.
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:24.941]  Like Doug Stanhope did that crazy night?
[02:08:24.941 --> 02:08:25.741]  I saw that video.
[02:08:25.741 --> 02:08:34.044]  And then some Marines started a fight with me because... You got really into it and I think they were expecting a comedy show and you just started going crazy about the New World Order.
[02:08:35.999 --> 02:08:37.720]  It got a little ugly.
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:39.561]  Well, I mean, Doug's like, come up here.
[02:08:39.561 --> 02:08:40.322]  I didn't want to go up.
[02:08:40.322 --> 02:08:41.242]  Doug's like, come up, come up.
[02:08:41.242 --> 02:08:42.643]  I'm like, man, I'm not going to do comedy.
[02:08:42.643 --> 02:08:52.970]  I had to listen to his message three times because he was laughing so hard while he was leaving the message describing you going on stage, what happened, all the chaos that ensued, and how you were up there.
[02:08:52.970 --> 02:08:54.971]  You were on stage for like a while, too, right?
[02:08:54.971 --> 02:08:55.951]  About 20 minutes.
[02:08:55.951 --> 02:08:58.533]  That's right, you even did the man show with him.
[02:08:58.533 --> 02:08:59.273]  You've done everything.
[02:08:59.273 --> 02:09:01.295]  Yeah, I've done a lot of dumb stuff.
[02:09:02.446 --> 02:09:03.647]  No, you've done well, Lord Vader.
[02:09:03.647 --> 02:09:04.827]  Lord Vader?
[02:09:04.827 --> 02:09:09.509]  Whoa, so I'm the evil guy?
[02:09:09.509 --> 02:09:14.791]  No, but there were some troops in the front row and they didn't like me being anti-war.
[02:09:14.791 --> 02:09:15.692]  Well, you know what?
[02:09:15.692 --> 02:09:17.553]  Troops never want to hear that.
[02:09:17.553 --> 02:09:22.715]  If they're risking their life going over there, they want to think that it's for a noble and just cause.
[02:09:22.715 --> 02:09:25.276]  In that sense, their actions are heroic.
[02:09:25.276 --> 02:09:27.397]  I just don't want more confidence coming back.
[02:09:27.657 --> 02:09:28.358]  Sure, of course.
[02:09:28.358 --> 02:09:29.819]  And a million and a half dead Iraqis.
[02:09:29.819 --> 02:09:34.584]  Well, not only that, I mean the whole idea of war in this day and age, it's a shell game.
[02:09:34.584 --> 02:09:43.592]  You're taking one leader, a leader of a group of people, and saying that he's going to protect them from another group of people that's wielded by another leader.
[02:09:43.592 --> 02:09:44.273]  And the U.S.
[02:09:44.273 --> 02:09:46.655]  put Saddam in to begin with, told him to invade Kuwait.
[02:09:46.715 --> 02:09:51.859]  Well, I mean, the whole conflict and resolution thing, the way it's set up, it's almost like there has to be war.
[02:09:51.859 --> 02:09:52.680]  There has to be problems.
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:58.904]  If there isn't, there's no way to keep control of the entire population and keep them from assimilating into one gigantic mass.
[02:09:58.904 --> 02:10:01.226]  I mean, that's really what people are holding back.
[02:10:01.226 --> 02:10:01.807]  That's it.
[02:10:01.807 --> 02:10:02.307]  Divide and conquer.
[02:10:02.307 --> 02:10:09.332]  The ability to communicate with everybody and the ability to think of all of us as just brothers and sisters on this planet, just fellow human beings.
[02:10:09.332 --> 02:10:10.213]  Instead of playing us off against each other.
[02:10:10.453 --> 02:10:10.973]  Exactly.
[02:10:10.973 --> 02:10:14.075]  They're playing us off against each other, just going off our bases fears.
[02:10:14.075 --> 02:10:19.217]  I mean that's what military and that's what government and leaders have been doing since the beginning of time.
[02:10:19.217 --> 02:10:25.280]  It's just it shouldn't work the same way now as it did when there was no communication, there was no internet.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:30.782]  It's like now that we have the ability to spread information so quickly and you know in that sense you're helping that along.
[02:10:30.782 --> 02:10:32.443]  You're helping put an end to that.
[02:10:32.443 --> 02:10:36.805]  I mean and eventually it will be that you know you can't trick everybody.
[02:10:37.085 --> 02:10:48.353]  We'll have so much access to information, it'll be impossible to convince someone that there's some people on the other side of the planet that have never seen them, never met them, and that they hate them for their freedom, or some other retarded idea.
[02:10:48.353 --> 02:11:01.443]  Well, Zbigniew Brzezinski in his grand chessboard book, Obama's Top Advisor 97, said, we built a world government, but we can't get our people to go take over our enemies anymore, because they don't see foreigners as their enemies, so we've got to hype that up in the media.
[02:11:01.443 --> 02:11:03.384]  I mean, they admit all this and write books about it.
[02:11:03.464 --> 02:11:10.391]  The whole idea behind government, the whole idea behind governing human beings has got to change, you know?
[02:11:10.391 --> 02:11:14.455]  What we've got to realize at some point in time is we're evolving.
[02:11:14.455 --> 02:11:18.860]  Human beings are evolving, and right now we're in some sort of an adolescent stage of evolution.
[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:20.702]  I think we're devolving right now.
[02:11:20.802 --> 02:11:23.843]  Well, you know, that's always coming along with it.
[02:11:23.843 --> 02:11:25.464]  It's because it makes it easier.
[02:11:25.464 --> 02:11:33.108]  Because when you make life easier for people and you don't make them develop discipline and skill, they can just drift through life like a retard.
[02:11:33.108 --> 02:11:35.029]  There's a lot of people that will just do that on instinct.
[02:11:35.029 --> 02:11:36.629]  That's another thing, that's another thing.
[02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:38.490]  I'm talking about you, Joe, while you're here.
[02:11:38.490 --> 02:11:43.953]  You also have been big into martial arts yourself and train with a lot of the people in Ultimate Fighting, don't you?
[02:11:44.113 --> 02:11:58.028]  Well, I do martial arts and I think that for your thinking, just to manage your biology as a man, I think it's very important to have control over your system, over your biological system.
[02:11:58.028 --> 02:11:59.250]  And I think one big
[02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:08.256]  Big effect on a lot of people's life is stress just stress from being stuck in traffic or your bills or not Just male stress just natural.
[02:12:08.256 --> 02:12:13.839]  I mean, we're designed to chase things down and and and beat on animals and stuff I mean, that's what we're here for.
[02:12:13.839 --> 02:12:17.782]  We have a certain amount of energy that we need to expire.
[02:12:17.782 --> 02:12:28.429]  We need to Express we need to pump it out of our body and if we don't do that It's very difficult to manage your emotions manage your thinking to think clearly and calmly and exercise is the best thing for that
[02:12:29.730 --> 02:12:34.616]  The best tool for just clear thinking and, you know, just objective thinking.
[02:12:34.616 --> 02:12:40.003]  It drains your body of all the unnatural stress and allows you to look at things with a more even keel.
[02:12:40.003 --> 02:12:40.684]  I agree.
[02:12:40.684 --> 02:12:42.046]  Let's shift gears back into politics.
[02:12:42.046 --> 02:12:46.051]  You've been very interested in this Glenn Beck clip.
[02:12:46.471 --> 02:12:49.173]  I mean, it's because it's about Ron Paul, really.
[02:12:49.173 --> 02:12:55.818]  I mean, Glenn Beck, like I said, I think is an interesting talking head, but he doesn't say anything that leads me to believe that I want to listen to him.
[02:12:55.818 --> 02:13:07.808]  He just says, when he's talking, it seems to me, a guy who wants you to believe that he makes sense and wants you to believe that, you know, he's a sensible man looking out for you.
[02:13:07.808 --> 02:13:09.529]  To me, he seems like a showman.
[02:13:09.529 --> 02:13:10.350]  He seems like some...
[02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:14.952]  Well, I think he's the only guy that's saying, listen, we need a radical restructuring of our government.
[02:13:30.638 --> 02:13:35.161]  And he's absolutely correct, and he is what a real conservative is supposed to be.
[02:13:35.161 --> 02:13:43.528]  I mean, by all stretches of the imagination, I mean, that guy's a real... I mean, there's no way you can say by any stretch of the imagination that he's not a conservative.
[02:13:43.528 --> 02:13:45.229]  I mean, he's a real conservative.
[02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:50.593]  A fiscal conservative, a social conservative, but he wants people to be able to do whatever they want.
[02:13:50.593 --> 02:13:52.134]  He believes in states' rights.
[02:13:52.134 --> 02:13:52.895]  He believes that
[02:13:53.135 --> 02:13:55.136]  The federal government is completely out of control.
[02:13:55.136 --> 02:13:56.096]  That it's too big.
[02:13:56.096 --> 02:13:59.598]  He believes that, you know, we have to get rid of the IRS.
[02:13:59.598 --> 02:14:01.058]  It's a flawed institution.
[02:14:01.058 --> 02:14:02.739]  He believes we have to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:14:02.739 --> 02:14:05.520]  He believes all these things that totally make sense.
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:08.301]  And when he says these things on TV, they laugh.
[02:14:08.301 --> 02:14:09.382]  And they make it like it's a joke.
[02:14:09.382 --> 02:14:13.944]  Like, even though we know that the system is completely... It's just completely...
[02:14:15.962 --> 02:14:16.903]  Unfixable.
[02:14:16.903 --> 02:14:27.753]  I mean, if you look at the way it is now, just it's a honeycomb of corruption and just bureaucratic BS and red tape and it's just... God, it's so gigantic!
[02:14:27.753 --> 02:14:29.395]  That's my next question, let's continue along Ron Paul.
[02:14:29.395 --> 02:14:30.216]  It's a business!
[02:14:30.216 --> 02:14:40.065]  The government is a business and we need... the way this world is structured, it's almost like we need that business to keep running in this ridiculous manner in order to keep people working.
[02:14:40.245 --> 02:14:40.405]  Yeah.
[02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:40.905]  Like a drug war.
[02:14:40.905 --> 02:14:41.325]  It's predatory.
[02:14:41.325 --> 02:14:42.586]  It is predatory.
[02:14:42.586 --> 02:14:43.846]  It feeds on other people.
[02:14:43.846 --> 02:14:46.367]  I mean, look, the whole idea behind private prisons.
[02:14:46.367 --> 02:14:48.408]  I mean, that's completely insane.
[02:14:48.408 --> 02:14:51.249]  That people can profit off of other people being in jail.
[02:14:51.249 --> 02:14:54.750]  Well, if that's the case, then they're going to support things that make more people go to jail.
[02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:55.030]  And they do.
[02:14:55.030 --> 02:14:55.810]  They lobby to keep
[02:14:55.930 --> 02:15:01.093]  If somebody caught with a marijuana cigarette in prison making widgets for them... You're right, they do.
[02:15:01.093 --> 02:15:02.213]  And it's sickening.
[02:15:02.213 --> 02:15:03.274]  It's like cannibalism.
[02:15:03.274 --> 02:15:06.415]  I mean, it's really like a social form of cannibalism.
[02:15:06.415 --> 02:15:08.597]  It's unbelievable that it's legal.
[02:15:08.597 --> 02:15:13.339]  And that's all stuff that Ron Paul, you know, what he stands against.
[02:15:13.339 --> 02:15:22.324]  And any rational, reasonable person who would listen to Ron Paul talk goes, well here's a guy who obviously understands the system, was calling the economic collapse way in advance.
[02:15:22.904 --> 02:15:26.226]  Yeah, I mean, he's a brilliant, brilliant guy, you know?
[02:15:26.226 --> 02:15:28.528]  And, I mean, he says a lot of stuff that I don't believe in.
[02:15:28.528 --> 02:15:30.269]  Like, he doesn't believe in evolution.
[02:15:30.269 --> 02:15:31.690]  You know, he thinks that evolution's a theory.
[02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:34.452]  But the point is, he isn't going to make you believe what he's... Exactly.
[02:15:34.452 --> 02:15:36.453]  And he isn't going to make you believe... Exactly.
[02:15:36.453 --> 02:15:39.875]  And that is a true, a true conservative.
[02:15:39.875 --> 02:15:49.542]  A person who's not... He's not a person who's trying to manipulate other people's lives, or change them, or bend them to the will of his convictions.
[02:15:49.542 --> 02:15:51.723]  No, he wants the state to get off people's backs and be themselves.
[02:15:51.883 --> 02:15:52.083]  Exactly.
[02:15:52.083 --> 02:15:53.844]  And that brings me to the next issue.
[02:15:53.844 --> 02:16:01.367]  George Bush campaigned to cut government, to not have foreign adventures, to not have wars, but his own documents that have now come out, PNAC, show that was their plan all along.
[02:16:01.367 --> 02:16:06.649]  That was a betrayal of true conservatives that drank the Kool-Aid thinking he would reverse what Clinton did.
[02:16:06.889 --> 02:16:08.130]  I don't think so.
[02:16:27.642 --> 02:16:29.983]  Well, I'm definitely apprehensive of a bigger government, no matter what.
[02:16:29.983 --> 02:16:33.864]  I mean, a bigger government, to me, sounds like more possibilities for problems, but...
[02:16:48.527 --> 02:16:51.609]  A bigger government that's not this government, you know?
[02:16:51.609 --> 02:16:56.091]  I mean, maybe what he's going to do will add to it in a positive way.
[02:16:56.091 --> 02:16:59.953]  Well, I'll tell you, he's totally on the bank... I mean, he is the man of the bankers.
[02:16:59.953 --> 02:17:05.817]  He got the bankered takeover bill, which then they bait and switch and didn't spend for what they said, and now they're saying the money's secret.
[02:17:05.817 --> 02:17:09.338]  I mean, he... I'm just telling you, Joe, and remember, and I know you're a smart guy, the day of 9-11,
[02:17:10.399 --> 02:17:17.550]  The day of 9-11, I came out and said it's an inside job, here's the evidence.
[02:17:17.550 --> 02:17:18.511]  You were on the air with me.
[02:17:18.511 --> 02:17:19.032]  I remember.
[02:17:19.032 --> 02:17:20.614]  But you know I don't just make things up.
[02:17:20.614 --> 02:17:22.417]  I've got just reams of evidence.
[02:17:22.417 --> 02:17:25.121]  Obama is probably going to end up being like Adolf Hitler.
[02:17:26.322 --> 02:17:29.324]  I'm saying if you think Bush was bad, prepare yourself.
[02:17:29.324 --> 02:17:29.664]  Really?
[02:17:29.664 --> 02:17:30.705]  You really think that he's going to?
[02:17:30.705 --> 02:17:38.231]  I mean, but he seems to be so socially liberal and it seems like he wants to close Guantanamo Bay and he wants to... Uh-huh!
[02:17:38.231 --> 02:17:40.172]  But see if you... Exactly.
[02:17:40.172 --> 02:17:43.375]  But ABC News admits they're going to open them up in the U.S.
[02:17:43.375 --> 02:17:52.102]  He's shutting that one down, paying lip service that he's against it, while opening more and leaving the ghost sites in Europe, you know, the real camps, open.
[02:17:52.932 --> 02:17:54.714]  And what are these real camps in Europe?
[02:17:54.714 --> 02:17:56.095]  There's their torture camps?
[02:17:56.095 --> 02:18:07.466]  Oh yeah, they're in Romania, they're in Latin America, they are in Jordan, they're in Egypt, they're in Poland, they're in Czech Republic, and it is... Now, but let me ask you this.
[02:18:07.466 --> 02:18:13.972]  If you think that the New World Order is in control of the world and that they manipulate the world's government, why do they need a Guantanamo Bay?
[02:18:13.972 --> 02:18:15.333]  Why do they need to torture some people?
[02:18:15.333 --> 02:18:22.559]  Because why did the Catholic Church need to have inquisitors to torture people to say they'd committed these crimes or witchcraft?
[02:18:22.559 --> 02:18:25.782]  Because they had to legitimize the whole suppression thing they were doing.
[02:18:25.782 --> 02:18:27.824]  They torture you to get fake confessions.
[02:18:27.824 --> 02:18:28.324]  Here's an example.
[02:18:28.324 --> 02:18:32.167]  Three weeks ago, they roll in, what, six defendants out of Guantanamo.
[02:18:32.167 --> 02:18:33.729]  They've been held between seven and five years.
[02:18:34.409 --> 02:18:45.456]  You know, they were picked up different times, and they go, they're about to plead guilty, and they walk them in, and no video's allowed, but the press is there, and they say, how do you plead?
[02:18:45.456 --> 02:18:48.739]  I've been tortured, I've been tortured, don't execute me, it's fake!
[02:18:48.739 --> 02:18:56.384]  But then that was barely in the news, but that was in the news, and so they're cancelling these trials because they've got to take them back and torture them some more.
[02:18:57.093 --> 02:19:01.358]  Well, this is also the first administration in a long time that used mercenaries.
[02:19:01.358 --> 02:19:01.738]  Right?
[02:19:01.738 --> 02:19:04.000]  Yes, and they're keeping all of that.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.585]  Blackwater is not only doing that overseas stuff, they're also involved in the war on drugs.
[02:19:08.585 --> 02:19:09.366]  In California.
[02:19:09.366 --> 02:19:12.529]  Yeah, they're going after medical marijuana dispensaries.
[02:19:12.529 --> 02:19:13.210]  It's incredible.
[02:19:13.210 --> 02:19:14.011]  I mean, there's photos of these.
[02:19:14.011 --> 02:19:15.813]  They confiscated guns in New Orleans.
[02:19:18.115 --> 02:19:19.776]  It's spooky, you know?
[02:19:19.776 --> 02:19:25.959]  I mean, I don't understand politics enough to say that I believe that, you know, Barack Obama's going to make a change.
[02:19:25.959 --> 02:19:29.601]  But I think one thing that he's good for is the psyche of the country.
[02:19:29.601 --> 02:19:33.763]  I think that what he represents to people is a new possibility.
[02:19:33.763 --> 02:19:39.146]  The fact that a guy who is a half-black guy from a single mom, like, can make it.
[02:19:39.146 --> 02:19:40.647]  No, that's a positive thing!
[02:19:40.647 --> 02:19:42.008]  We're going to come back and talk about that.
[02:19:42.008 --> 02:19:45.650]  The problem is, he's going to make everybody love their slavery
[02:19:46.050 --> 02:19:48.693]  As this agenda happens and makes them feel good.
[02:19:48.693 --> 02:19:53.778]  Maybe he infiltrated, maybe he got into the system and he's gonna clean it up from the inside.
[02:19:53.778 --> 02:19:55.099]  With Secretary of Defense Gates?
[02:19:55.099 --> 02:19:58.342]  Well maybe he knows that the Anunnaki are coming and the world ends in 2012.
[02:19:58.342 --> 02:20:00.525]  Stay there Joe Rogan, stay with us.
[02:20:01.539 --> 02:20:03.520]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:10.483]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:20:10.483 --> 02:20:18.887]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:18.887 --> 02:20:24.610]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:20:26.632 --> 02:20:28.815]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[02:21:01.204 --> 02:21:07.848]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:07.848 --> 02:21:09.589]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:10.478 --> 02:21:12.019]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.019 --> 02:21:12.819]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:12.819 --> 02:21:13.820]  This is his M.O.
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.200]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:17.181]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.181 --> 02:21:24.325]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:24.325 --> 02:21:24.805]  Some U.S.
[02:21:24.805 --> 02:21:30.448]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.148 --> 02:21:34.670]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:45.134]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:21:45.134 --> 02:21:46.375]  Fabled enemies.

[02:21:54.118 --> 02:21:57.480]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:00.856 --> 02:22:01.356]  Good day.
[02:22:01.356 --> 02:22:03.038]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:03.038 --> 02:22:03.458]  January 19, 2009.
[02:22:03.458 --> 02:22:04.579]  Gold opened this morning at $836.90.
[02:22:04.579 --> 02:22:07.802]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $861.80, $430.90 for a half-ounce, and $215.45 for the quarter-ounce.
[02:22:07.802 --> 02:22:08.442]  That's $861.80, $430.90, and $215.45.
[02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:23.916]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:22:23.916 --> 02:22:28.121]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a Yan revolution.
[02:22:28.121 --> 02:22:36.250]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:22:36.250 --> 02:22:38.592]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:22:38.792 --> 02:22:39.653]  We're good to go.
[02:23:01.016 --> 02:23:02.698]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:23:02.698 --> 02:23:04.439]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:23:04.439 --> 02:23:07.142]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:23:07.142 --> 02:23:12.267]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:23:12.267 --> 02:23:15.470]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:23:15.470 --> 02:23:18.933]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[02:23:19.355 --> 02:23:31.902]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[02:23:31.902 --> 02:23:33.924]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[02:23:33.924 --> 02:23:35.645]  I use one every day.
[02:23:35.645 --> 02:23:38.086]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:23:38.386 --> 02:23:39.086]  Before you slip into
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:15.706]  Unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[02:24:15.706 --> 02:24:25.031]  Another flashing chance at bliss.
[02:24:25.031 --> 02:24:29.974]  Another kiss, another kiss.
[02:24:40.094 --> 02:24:50.270]  The days are bright and filled with pain Enclose me in your gentle reign
[02:25:02.056 --> 02:25:03.858]  Joe Rogan.net is the website.
[02:25:03.858 --> 02:25:06.660]  It's got a huge MySpace of millions of people.
[02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:12.204]  Joe, what's the best site for folks to check out for all your comedy, your material, the work you're doing, your political statements?
[02:25:12.204 --> 02:25:14.726]  Joe Rogan.net's the best site to check out.
[02:25:14.726 --> 02:25:21.612]  I have a Facebook page and a MySpace page and everything, and I do go on those, but my website, JoeRogan.net, is where I do most of my stuff.
[02:25:21.612 --> 02:25:26.796]  And then I have a message board on JoeRogan.net that I'm on pretty much every day.
[02:25:26.796 --> 02:25:28.978]  Continuing with Barack Obama, just
[02:25:31.134 --> 02:25:38.978]  He's created a separate USAService.org, never before done, under himself, private.
[02:25:38.978 --> 02:25:39.698]  What does that mean?
[02:25:39.698 --> 02:25:44.801]  And they're running national, it's not government, they're running national TV ads as government ads saying join this.
[02:25:44.801 --> 02:25:47.262]  It's got hundreds of thousands of members in a week and a half.
[02:25:48.396 --> 02:26:03.591]  And when you study history that is classical fascism or Mao Zedong communism when you know Mao had his own private group of youth and then on top of that I'm sure you've heard they won 18 to 24 forced compulsory a new domestic army as big as the US military?
[02:26:04.858 --> 02:26:06.780]  That's what Obama wants?
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:07.380]  Absolutely.
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:08.782]  You want me to pull the clips?
[02:26:08.782 --> 02:26:10.704]  Well, tell me, yeah, explain it to me.
[02:26:10.704 --> 02:26:12.585]  No, no, I mean, I'm... This is what he wants?
[02:26:12.585 --> 02:26:15.508]  He wants a youth army for domestic issues?
[02:26:15.508 --> 02:26:18.591]  Yes, and they're talking about... Voluntary?
[02:26:18.591 --> 02:26:19.512]  No, compulsory.
[02:26:19.512 --> 02:26:25.417]  There's one that's compulsory, but he can have a separate volunteer corps that's private under him.
[02:26:25.417 --> 02:26:27.800]  Running with government money on TV.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:28.020]  Wow.
[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:37.286]  I mean, isn't it dangerous anytime in history when they say, get behind this guy and he'll fix it?
[02:26:37.972 --> 02:26:43.676]  Yes, I think it's always dangerous, and I think right now we're very desperate for something to bring us back to normal.
[02:26:43.676 --> 02:26:52.964]  I mean, people were living in fantasy land for a long time, you know, they got wealthy with very little effort, and I think people just want that to come back again.
[02:26:52.964 --> 02:26:57.547]  They want our economy to blossom to the ridiculous proportions that it was in in the past.
[02:26:57.547 --> 02:27:00.970]  So they'll drink the Kool-Aid if the Kool-Aid server claims they'll bring Valhalla back.
[02:27:00.970 --> 02:27:01.190]  Right.
[02:27:02.832 --> 02:27:04.775]  Who knows what his motivation is?
[02:27:04.775 --> 02:27:06.559]  I mean, his motivation may be pure.
[02:27:06.559 --> 02:27:12.170]  I mean, his motivation may very well be that he's trying to fix the predicament that we're in.
[02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:12.230]  Or...
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:16.062]  He may be a New World Order shill, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:16.062 --> 02:27:18.084]  I have him on video calling for a New World Order.
[02:27:18.084 --> 02:27:18.464]  Oh.
[02:27:18.464 --> 02:27:19.405]  What's he saying?
[02:27:19.405 --> 02:27:21.226]  He said we all want a New World Order.
[02:27:21.226 --> 02:27:22.447]  Is that what he said?
[02:27:22.447 --> 02:27:23.168]  Yeah.
[02:27:23.168 --> 02:27:27.672]  Well, do you think that people, when they say a New World Order, do they mean like a new order to the world?
[02:27:27.672 --> 02:27:28.472]  Well, they've all written books.
[02:27:28.472 --> 02:27:31.995]  Or do they mean like New World Order as in like Darth Vader type stuff?
[02:27:31.995 --> 02:27:34.357]  Well, his advisors have written books about what they mean.
[02:27:34.357 --> 02:27:34.957]  What did they say?
[02:27:34.957 --> 02:27:38.640]  Like Rahm Emanuel said, national force, service, everyone will have to serve.
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:40.462]  And they say the New World Order means a world government.
[02:27:41.617 --> 02:27:42.440]  One world government.
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:44.932]  Run by the private banks.
[02:27:44.932 --> 02:27:45.655]  What a good idea.
[02:27:48.456 --> 02:27:49.316]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:27:49.316 --> 02:27:54.898]  I mean, we're never going to get to the point where, you know, I give you gold and, you know, and you give me a side of beef.
[02:27:54.898 --> 02:27:56.498]  You know, we're not going to get to that spot anymore.
[02:27:56.498 --> 02:28:00.540]  You know, it's always going to be dictated by money and credit.
[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:02.020]  Things just get so ethereal.
[02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:02.900]  They just get so intangible.
[02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:06.881]  And because they control it, and because they control that ether, they rule.
[02:28:06.881 --> 02:28:09.402]  I showed you this article out of the LA Times two days ago.
[02:28:09.402 --> 02:28:09.982]  What is this?
[02:28:09.982 --> 02:28:14.784]  The woman's children spilt the Bloody Mary, were fighting, so she spatted one on the leg.
[02:28:15.724 --> 02:28:16.926]  Oh, she hit it?
[02:28:16.926 --> 02:28:17.486]  She hit the kid?
[02:28:17.486 --> 02:28:20.550]  Well, but she wasn't charged, because spanking isn't illegal, hurting them is.
[02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.971]  Okay.
[02:28:20.971 --> 02:28:23.714]  She was charged with a disturbance as a terrorist on a plane.
[02:28:23.714 --> 02:28:24.635]  Right.
[02:28:24.635 --> 02:28:27.658]  And was given a big prison sentence.
[02:28:27.658 --> 02:28:29.020]  Let me just read it.
[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:29.941]  A prison sentence?
[02:28:29.941 --> 02:28:32.584]  In-flight confrontations can lead to terrorism charges.
[02:28:32.584 --> 02:28:35.368]  Reporting from Los Angeles and Oklahoma City, Tamara Jo Freeman was on the
[02:28:35.828 --> 02:28:43.813]  Frontier Airlines flight to Denver in 2007 when her two children began to quarrel, she's a reporter, over the window shade and then spilled a Bloody Mary in her lap.
[02:28:43.813 --> 02:28:45.675]  She spanked each of them on the thigh with three swats.
[02:28:45.675 --> 02:28:52.159]  It was a small incident, but one that highlighted the anxiety of September 11th attacks would eventually have enormous ramifications for Freeman and her children.
[02:28:52.159 --> 02:28:57.382]  A flight attendant confronted Freeman, who was reported by hurling a few profanities, and then it goes on.
[02:28:57.382 --> 02:29:05.088]  The incident aboard the Frontier flight ultimately led to Freeman's arrest and conviction for a federal felony defined as an act of terrorism under the USA Patriot Act.
[02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:10.519]  The controversial federal law enacted after 2001 attacks in Washington.
[02:29:10.519 --> 02:29:15.050]  They arrested her, didn't allow her to have a lawyer under terror charges for three months until she pled guilty.
[02:29:16.676 --> 02:29:19.278]  So she was locked up for three months?
[02:29:19.278 --> 02:29:20.178]  Until she pled guilty.
[02:29:20.178 --> 02:29:21.459]  That's what they do in the Patriot Act.
[02:29:21.459 --> 02:29:27.683]  But then it goes on to say, 200 people alone on flights charged with terrorism for as much as arguing.
[02:29:27.683 --> 02:29:28.103]  It says that.
[02:29:28.103 --> 02:29:33.266]  Well, they do have, like a lot of flight attendants especially, do have this crazy attitude.
[02:29:33.266 --> 02:29:40.811]  Like when they tell you to shut off your phone if you didn't listen to them, you know, if you weren't paying attention, you know, and they'll come over you like they're soldiers.
[02:29:40.811 --> 02:29:43.132]  You know, it gets like they have the power to get rid of you.
[02:29:43.132 --> 02:29:45.353]  You know, sir, I will ask you off this plane.
[02:29:46.594 --> 02:29:47.235]  Joe, stay there.
[02:29:47.235 --> 02:29:48.736]  Quick break, long segment coming up.
[02:29:48.736 --> 02:29:50.978]  You want to take calls?
[02:29:50.978 --> 02:29:51.478]  Yes.
[02:29:51.478 --> 02:29:51.659]  800-259-9231.
[02:29:51.659 --> 02:29:54.661]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.661 --> 02:30:01.848]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.848 --> 02:30:05.211]  Hello, this is Tom with hempusa.org.
[02:30:05.211 --> 02:30:12.377]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.

[02:30:37.263 --> 02:30:37.603]  Call 908-691-2608
[02:30:40.720 --> 02:30:45.084]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[02:31:09.284 --> 02:31:10.485]  At least we thought we did.
[02:31:10.485 --> 02:31:17.534]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:31:17.534 --> 02:31:26.044]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:31:26.414 --> 02:31:33.520]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:36.683]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[02:31:36.683 --> 02:31:42.469]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:45.551]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:31:45.551 --> 02:31:52.778]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[02:31:55.657 --> 02:31:56.399]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.

[02:32:33.656 --> 02:32:35.697]  Food is an everyday need.
[02:32:35.697 --> 02:32:36.797]  The 3-Day Responder
[02:32:37.310 --> 02:32:41.272]  Is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[02:32:41.272 --> 02:32:44.693]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[02:32:44.693 --> 02:32:48.275]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[02:32:48.275 --> 02:32:50.996]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:50.996 --> 02:32:53.317]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:33:22.234 --> 02:33:33.802]  We're gonna open the phones up, the network, please give me the new call list, 800-259-9231.
[02:33:33.802 --> 02:33:43.589]  Talk to Joe Rogan here in studio, the police chief will come about 10-15 minutes after, and I'm tempted to bring the police chief in here and ask him police state questions and have Joe jump on him.
[02:33:43.589 --> 02:33:44.029]  Oh, whoa.
[02:33:44.029 --> 02:33:45.230]  Not while I'm here.
[02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:46.971]  I'll do that over the phone.
[02:33:46.971 --> 02:33:48.973]  I don't want to get arrested pulling out of station.
[02:33:49.815 --> 02:33:51.156]  I didn't mean physically jump on him.
[02:33:51.156 --> 02:33:51.897]  No, I know what you mean.
[02:33:51.897 --> 02:33:53.919]  I mean, talk to him, jump on him is a bad idea.
[02:33:53.919 --> 02:33:54.819]  But I meant that as a joke.
[02:33:54.819 --> 02:33:56.541]  The police chief's a nice, friendly guy.
[02:33:56.541 --> 02:33:58.403]  You know, I found out from folks that it doesn't matter.
[02:33:58.403 --> 02:33:59.484]  It doesn't matter?
[02:33:59.484 --> 02:34:02.746]  Point is, he goes around at the police station doing Alex Jones imitations.
[02:34:02.746 --> 02:34:03.847]  Oh, nice.
[02:34:03.847 --> 02:34:06.109]  So we heard the police chief was friendly towards us.
[02:34:06.109 --> 02:34:07.330]  I don't really like what he's doing.
[02:34:07.330 --> 02:34:09.773]  He does forced blood draws at checkpoints here in Austin.
[02:34:10.353 --> 02:34:11.634]  They draw... what?
[02:34:11.634 --> 02:34:13.835]  And so we called him up and he agreed to come in the studio last time.
[02:34:13.835 --> 02:34:15.075]  Forced blood draws?
[02:34:15.075 --> 02:34:15.676]  Yes.
[02:34:15.676 --> 02:34:16.656]  Why do they do blood draws?
[02:34:16.656 --> 02:34:18.817]  Is that a more accurate way of detecting alcohol in the system?
[02:34:18.817 --> 02:34:19.998]  Yeah, but it violates the Fourth Amendment.
[02:34:19.998 --> 02:34:23.139]  You're supposed to be able to refuse that or they're supposed to get a warrant, but they don't.
[02:34:23.139 --> 02:34:26.601]  They have these rubber stamp warrants and they use the Patriot Act to do it.
[02:34:26.601 --> 02:34:27.461]  Wow.
[02:34:27.461 --> 02:34:28.081]  But he's real nice.
[02:34:28.081 --> 02:34:29.782]  He'll give you all these excuses for it.
[02:34:29.782 --> 02:34:30.823]  He's like, oh Alex, I like your show.
[02:34:30.823 --> 02:34:31.383]  I heard you say this.
[02:34:31.383 --> 02:34:32.023]  I heard you do that.
[02:34:32.023 --> 02:34:33.304]  And what's his excuse for taking your blood?
[02:34:33.304 --> 02:34:34.344]  And he'll do an Alex Jones imitation.
[02:34:34.344 --> 02:34:36.185]  I'll tell you right now, we're gonna... I'm sorry.
[02:34:36.185 --> 02:34:38.366]  What's his excuse for taking your blood?
[02:34:38.366 --> 02:34:39.467]  To catch the alcohol in it.
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:47.243]  If you refuse to give a breathalyzer at a checkpoint, which is your Fourth Amendment right, the courts have said what they're doing is illegal.
[02:34:47.243 --> 02:34:48.023]  They just go ahead and do it.
[02:34:48.023 --> 02:34:48.443]  So how do they do it?
[02:34:48.443 --> 02:34:49.504]  Do they prick your finger?
[02:34:49.504 --> 02:34:50.444]  No, they suck.
[02:34:50.444 --> 02:34:53.666]  The cops hold you down if need be and suck it out of an eye.
[02:34:53.666 --> 02:34:54.606]  They do an IV?
[02:34:54.606 --> 02:34:55.647]  Like they go into your vein?
[02:34:55.647 --> 02:34:57.247]  Yeah, like when you take blood when you go to the doctor.
[02:34:57.247 --> 02:34:57.848]  That's hilarious.
[02:34:57.848 --> 02:34:59.949]  Are you going to trust cops to do that?
[02:35:01.061 --> 02:35:01.962]  They tried.
[02:35:01.962 --> 02:35:04.944]  They've done it like in Tucson and Austin and a few other cities.
[02:35:04.944 --> 02:35:06.245]  They tried it in Indiana.
[02:35:06.245 --> 02:35:07.746]  Four or five states are trying it.
[02:35:07.746 --> 02:35:09.127]  Cities in four or five states.
[02:35:09.127 --> 02:35:10.328]  And the hospitals refuse.
[02:35:10.328 --> 02:35:13.210]  They show up without warrants saying, take this guy's blood and the hospital's going to know.
[02:35:13.210 --> 02:35:15.972]  What if it's like a giant fat guy and you can't get a vein?
[02:35:15.972 --> 02:35:17.913]  Cops just keep plunging the needle.
[02:35:17.913 --> 02:35:19.514]  Oh!
[02:35:19.514 --> 02:35:20.795]  Alright, Jones.
[02:35:20.795 --> 02:35:21.796]  I was going to say something dirty.
[02:35:26.596 --> 02:35:34.544]  Well, Joe, after we got caught with that satanic video we did... Yes, the satanic video we did in the bathroom of the state capitol house.
[02:35:34.544 --> 02:35:35.625]  What is that building?
[02:35:35.625 --> 02:35:36.165]  Was that a building?
[02:35:36.165 --> 02:35:37.507]  Is that a state capitol building?
[02:35:37.507 --> 02:35:39.148]  Beautiful building.
[02:35:39.148 --> 02:35:39.509]  Oh, man.
[02:35:39.509 --> 02:35:42.492]  Smoked pot in that bathroom.
[02:35:42.492 --> 02:35:44.133]  I didn't know you did that.
[02:35:44.133 --> 02:35:45.014]  You didn't do that.
[02:35:45.014 --> 02:35:45.835]  We did it on video, man.
[02:35:45.835 --> 02:35:46.696]  What are you talking about?
[02:35:47.472 --> 02:35:48.793]  I don't smoke pot!
[02:35:48.793 --> 02:35:49.854]  I did.
[02:35:49.854 --> 02:35:50.575]  You didn't.
[02:35:50.575 --> 02:35:52.597]  He said it made you paranoid.
[02:35:52.597 --> 02:35:53.638]  We have it on video.
[02:35:53.638 --> 02:35:55.140]  Your memory is getting clouded.
[02:35:55.140 --> 02:35:56.241]  No, we have it on video.
[02:35:56.241 --> 02:35:59.844]  You were in the... No, it's in the Cap City bathroom.
[02:35:59.844 --> 02:36:02.327]  We pretended it was the bathroom of the Capitol building.
[02:36:02.327 --> 02:36:03.728]  Yes, yes, for the film.
[02:36:03.728 --> 02:36:04.148]  Exactly.
[02:36:04.148 --> 02:36:05.049]  Okay, I was freaking out.
[02:36:05.049 --> 02:36:06.090]  No, no, I'm just playing.
[02:36:06.090 --> 02:36:07.932]  I was saying, oh my God, SWAT teams are on there.
[02:36:07.932 --> 02:36:09.053]  We did not do that.
[02:36:09.053 --> 02:36:09.894]  We did not do that.
[02:36:09.894 --> 02:36:10.815]  No, we did not do that.
[02:36:12.409 --> 02:36:12.969]  Oh my God.
[02:36:12.969 --> 02:36:14.270]  You're a little nervous.
[02:36:14.270 --> 02:36:19.233]  Well, no, because people are going to... I shouldn't even joke and say it was a secret satanic ceremony.
[02:36:19.233 --> 02:36:27.257]  Because it's a video sold in stores, but people grab it and again... How could it be a satanic ceremony if we have rubber George Bush masks on?
[02:36:30.938 --> 02:36:33.679]  They say they caught me, they say it's secret.
[02:36:33.679 --> 02:36:45.664]  It's like every week we talk here on air and then kind of behind the scenes, internet stream only, I'll talk to guests sometimes and then people grab that and say, look this was Alex Jones caught secretly saying this as if that makes it more special.
[02:36:45.664 --> 02:36:48.125]  Well that is the problem with the internet.
[02:36:48.585 --> 02:36:48.785]  Yeah.
[02:36:48.785 --> 02:36:52.186]  Well, also with the internet, there's so much of you out there.
[02:36:52.186 --> 02:37:00.747]  There's so many times that you've talked, so many times you've been on the radio, and all of it is available to dissect, and you could always find something.
[02:37:00.747 --> 02:37:06.309]  I mean, if you follow me all day, every day, for sure I'm going to be a retard 25, 30 minutes a day.
[02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:11.170]  If you chopped that up and just only showed that, you'd go, God, that guy's retarded.
[02:37:11.170 --> 02:37:12.670]  Well, they do worse than that.
[02:37:12.670 --> 02:37:17.911]  I'll be speaking out against racists, and then they edit it together, where I'm saying, kill black people.
[02:37:19.171 --> 02:37:24.833]  In fact, they've edited it together where I talk about in Tennessee or in Denver when white supremacists tried to get Obama.
[02:37:24.833 --> 02:37:27.154]  They edit that together where it's me saying I'm going to get him.
[02:37:27.154 --> 02:37:33.856]  Well, it's going to get really squirrely when people can actually imitate your voice exactly with a computer, and that's not too far away.
[02:37:33.856 --> 02:37:35.116]  Well, the government's already got it, but yeah.
[02:37:35.236 --> 02:37:35.796]  I'm sure.
[02:37:35.796 --> 02:37:38.438]  I mean, sound is, you know, you can manipulate sound.
[02:37:38.438 --> 02:37:46.463]  I mean, you look at what they can do with CGI, what they can do with computer graphics and make, you know, computer games look so realistic, and of course, what they can do in movies.
[02:37:46.463 --> 02:37:47.984]  I mean, it's incredible now.
[02:37:47.984 --> 02:37:51.426]  I mean, they're going to be able to do that with sound at a certain point in time.
[02:37:51.426 --> 02:37:58.251]  They are going to be able to say whatever they want and write it out and have a computer literally speak, you know?
[02:37:58.251 --> 02:38:02.393]  So, it could be an exact replica of Alex Jones' voice.
[02:38:03.393 --> 02:38:04.634]  You want to be necessary.
[02:38:04.634 --> 02:38:07.858]  The New World Order will tell everybody what needs to be done.
[02:38:07.858 --> 02:38:11.741]  They'll have you in here like, what's that dude that died?
[02:38:11.741 --> 02:38:13.423]  Weekend at Bernie's?
[02:38:13.423 --> 02:38:14.905]  You'll have a stick up your ass.
[02:38:14.905 --> 02:38:15.806]  You'll be sitting in that chair.
[02:38:17.082 --> 02:38:18.984]  And they'll just have your lips move CGI style.
[02:38:18.984 --> 02:38:22.408]  You know, I've decided George Bush is an alright guy.
[02:38:22.408 --> 02:38:23.689]  I've decided I like Obama.
[02:38:23.689 --> 02:38:26.212]  Meanwhile, I'm wearing cement shoes in Lake Tahoe.
[02:38:26.212 --> 02:38:26.993]  Exactly.
[02:38:26.993 --> 02:38:29.475]  And Alex Jones just goes on forever.
[02:38:29.475 --> 02:38:29.816]  You're all CGI.
[02:38:29.816 --> 02:38:32.699]  You know, I used to believe in the New World Order, but it doesn't exist.
[02:38:32.699 --> 02:38:35.382]  Now let's cut to the New World Order capital and the world leader.
[02:38:35.382 --> 02:38:36.823]  Exactly.
[02:38:36.823 --> 02:38:39.046]  All your friends will be like, man, it just doesn't seem like Alex.
[02:38:39.795 --> 02:38:54.527]  Well, you know, some of the top techies at Wired Magazine and some of the top video analysts in the country, and also in Canada and France, they analyzed that one Bin Laden tape where it looks like
[02:38:55.592 --> 02:39:01.275]  Kind of the generic, uh, anime, uh, Final Fantasy model they use, and they just put a beard on it.
[02:39:01.275 --> 02:39:01.736]  Right.
[02:39:01.736 --> 02:39:04.998]  And you can see it's not even a good, uh, fake.
[02:39:04.998 --> 02:39:12.142]  And then they did voice analyzation, uh, in two different countries and said, and had linguists listen, and they ran the real Bin Laden's voice through a voice key.
[02:39:12.662 --> 02:39:17.965]  And then they ran the fake Bin Laden voice through and said, number one, it's not even near the voice key, so it's not him.
[02:39:17.965 --> 02:39:19.345]  Wouldn't pass the voice key.
[02:39:19.345 --> 02:39:31.312]  But then they had linguists listen and said, no, that's a Westerner who did grow up in the Middle East, probably Jordan, they can even tell the inflections, who's lived in the West most of their life or all their life, who then did the voiceover for it.
[02:39:31.312 --> 02:39:35.214]  So they proved... So some language expert that just recreated it.
[02:39:35.214 --> 02:39:35.754]  Yeah, two of them.
[02:39:36.314 --> 02:39:52.288]  Isn't that something that they proved with one of those beheading videos as well, that those guys were not Arabs, that those guys were Americans, the accents were all wrong, and then also that the body would not have reacted like that, that it would have bled much more when they were cutting his throat, that he was already dead when they did that?
[02:39:53.109 --> 02:39:55.852]  And then there was another video that they put out.
[02:39:55.852 --> 02:39:56.573]  Which makes sense.
[02:39:56.573 --> 02:40:03.801]  I mean, if you want to scare people, you want to scare people, and you get one wacky dude that wants to go camping in Iraq, let's just cut his head off.
[02:40:03.801 --> 02:40:04.782]  Let me tell one more story.
[02:40:04.782 --> 02:40:07.204]  Folks, throw up a video graphic.
[02:40:07.204 --> 02:40:09.326]  Throw up theprisonplanet.com a show.
[02:40:09.326 --> 02:40:10.187]  Throw up that graphic.
[02:40:10.187 --> 02:40:11.188]  I'm going to show folks.
[02:40:11.949 --> 02:40:21.636]  If you analyze this graphic, and this is Easy Technology, and Wired Magazine did this, if you analyze this graphic, you will see that it was originally put in in the first generation video layer.
[02:40:21.636 --> 02:40:22.636]  Okay?
[02:40:22.636 --> 02:40:35.005]  With the Bin Laden videos put out by a group called the Intel Center, which the head guy at it, admittedly, is the protege, Adonald Rumsfeld, who didn't just work at the Pentagon, he worked in psych warfare for two decades at the Pentagon.
[02:40:35.005 --> 02:40:39.648]  So the former head of psych warfare under Rumsfeld, when he was previously in the Department of Defense,
[02:40:40.859 --> 02:40:41.880]  Okay.
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:47.885]  He puts out a... They're the ones that always release the Bin Laden videos.
[02:40:47.885 --> 02:40:55.731]  And then they found that the Al-Qaeda bug was put in in the same video layer as the Intel Center bug.
[02:40:55.731 --> 02:40:55.951]  Wow.
[02:40:56.857 --> 02:41:06.622]  Well, you know, the most hilarious connection ever with our government and illegal things was that crashed plane that had been to Guantanamo Bay several times.
[02:41:06.622 --> 02:41:06.962]  Oh yeah.
[02:41:06.962 --> 02:41:09.503]  It was filled with cocaine that crashed in Mexico.
[02:41:09.503 --> 02:41:11.804]  I mean, that's just genius.
[02:41:11.804 --> 02:41:12.665]  That's just beautiful.
[02:41:13.365 --> 02:41:21.609]  When people don't want to believe that the government's capable of selling drugs, there's people that see billions and billions of dollars being transferred through the hands of criminals.
[02:41:21.609 --> 02:41:23.530]  You don't think they would want to get in on that?
[02:41:23.530 --> 02:41:28.573]  You know, a government that willingly lets people sell cigarettes in this country, you know, because they're being paid off.
[02:41:28.573 --> 02:41:29.993]  They know that cigarettes kill 400,000 people a year.
[02:41:31.394 --> 02:41:33.536]  Every year, just in this country alone, and nobody cares.
[02:41:33.536 --> 02:41:37.339]  I mean, there's no politicians that are pushing to get cigarettes outlawed.
[02:41:37.339 --> 02:41:38.239]  You know, they don't care.
[02:41:38.239 --> 02:41:41.362]  They don't mind cocaine getting into this country, as long as they can profit on it.
[02:41:41.362 --> 02:41:45.204]  And the way they profit that way is just pure, pure profit, you know?
[02:41:45.204 --> 02:41:46.746]  I mean, they've been doing that forever.
[02:41:46.746 --> 02:41:58.975]  If you look at the story of Barry Seale and Mina Arkansas, you know, and what happened with him, the guy was about to testify that he had been smuggling cocaine into the United States forever with the CIA, and they shot him.
[02:41:59.335 --> 02:42:04.157]  When they shot him, he had George Bush's home phone number in his pocket.
[02:42:04.157 --> 02:42:06.517]  Yeah, that came out.
[02:42:06.517 --> 02:42:11.059]  I mean, if you look into that story, the government has been selling drugs for a long time.
[02:42:11.059 --> 02:42:20.121]  It's quite interesting that we're in a war on drugs when it's very possible that the government is probably the number one distributor of cocaine in this whole country.
[02:42:20.121 --> 02:42:21.262]  And heroin.
[02:42:21.262 --> 02:42:28.364]  Well, you notice that after they went into Afghanistan, record, within two years, record amount of opium coming out of Afghanistan.
[02:42:28.544 --> 02:42:33.447]  Yeah, I mean, isn't that like a gigantic percentage of the world's opium supplies is all from Afghanistan?
[02:42:33.447 --> 02:42:33.647]  Yeah, 80%.
[02:42:33.647 --> 02:42:35.228]  Yeah, they control that stuff.
[02:42:35.228 --> 02:42:36.749]  I mean, if they control, why would they?
[02:42:36.749 --> 02:42:39.630]  There's just, you're not going to stop junkies.
[02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:42.272]  People are addicted to opiates, they're going to stay addicted.
[02:42:42.272 --> 02:42:46.495]  I mean, a vast majority of them, you know, and they're going to want that stuff.
[02:42:46.495 --> 02:42:47.535]  There's a demand.
[02:42:47.535 --> 02:42:48.276]  And that demand is...
[02:42:49.136 --> 02:42:50.557]  To the tune of billions of dollars.
[02:42:50.557 --> 02:42:52.238]  That's the same with the Vietnam War.
[02:42:52.238 --> 02:42:54.980]  You know, the Vietnam War, it was a huge junk running scheme.
[02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:56.781]  I mean, that was a big part of the war.
[02:42:56.781 --> 02:43:08.729]  You know, I mean, if you look into, I mean, like Kevin Booth's documentary was really good on the drug war, but if you look in the way our economy is structured, it's almost like drugs have to be illegal.
[02:43:08.729 --> 02:43:11.591]  It's almost like that's a part of the whole system itself.
[02:43:12.603 --> 02:43:13.083]  Absolutely.
[02:43:13.083 --> 02:43:22.811]  Well, I mean, if you go back, Skull and Bones was founded by the British back in 1832 with opium money from the British East India Company.
[02:43:22.811 --> 02:43:24.592]  That was their main product after tea.
[02:43:24.592 --> 02:43:28.755]  And so when they made alcohol illegal so they could jack up prices, that went away.
[02:43:28.755 --> 02:43:37.522]  They then created drug prohibition when before cocaine and heroin was sold in all the drug stores to then make it nouveau riche, you know, to make it popular, to jack up the prices.
[02:43:37.522 --> 02:43:42.105]  And so, of course, they've been bringing the drugs in all along and they made it illegal to jack up the price.
[02:43:42.265 --> 02:43:44.427]  It's amazing that people don't want to hear stuff like this.
[02:43:44.427 --> 02:43:48.469]  They hear things like that and they think it's just wacky conspiracy theories.
[02:43:48.469 --> 02:43:49.310]  Mainline history.
[02:43:49.310 --> 02:43:51.451]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[02:43:51.451 --> 02:43:54.053]  It's history and it's history that's going on right now.
[02:43:54.053 --> 02:43:56.495]  And people don't want to believe it.
[02:43:56.495 --> 02:43:58.256]  It's kind of interesting.
[02:43:58.256 --> 02:44:01.018]  It's interesting how much we're willing to bury our head in the sand.
[02:44:01.018 --> 02:44:07.262]  But why is it bad when there's tens of thousands of studies and now hundreds of uses by mainline medical systems for
[02:44:08.783 --> 02:44:12.866]  The HTC, the chemicals that are in marijuana.
[02:44:12.866 --> 02:44:16.528]  But then, you don't take Prozac, but you like to smoke a little bit of marijuana.
[02:44:16.528 --> 02:44:17.409]  And you're a criminal.
[02:44:17.409 --> 02:44:17.889]  And you're a criminal.
[02:44:17.889 --> 02:44:18.369]  It's ridiculous.
[02:44:18.369 --> 02:44:19.550]  It's because they can't control it.
[02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:20.531]  It's because it's a plant.
[02:44:20.531 --> 02:44:21.251]  It's that simple.
[02:44:21.251 --> 02:44:24.754]  It's like, you can't control people growing a plant.
[02:44:24.754 --> 02:44:26.275]  So you have to make that plant illegal.
[02:44:26.275 --> 02:44:27.596]  You can't patent it.
[02:44:27.596 --> 02:44:38.423]  You can't, you know, pharmaceutical companies, if it's gonna kill, you know, a hundred of their different products, if marijuana is a healthier, more natural substitute for a hundred of their products, they fight against it.
[02:44:38.863 --> 02:44:45.806]  You know, what's really fascinating is that Schedule 1 drugs in this country, the ones that are the most illegal, oftentimes are the safest.
[02:44:45.806 --> 02:44:47.467]  Marijuana, Schedule 1 drug.
[02:44:47.467 --> 02:44:49.328]  Never killed anyone, but Prozac?
[02:44:49.328 --> 02:44:49.968]  Exactly.
[02:44:49.968 --> 02:44:53.969]  They admit over 300,000 deaths a year from prescription drugs.
[02:44:53.969 --> 02:44:55.070]  Well, even crystal meth.
[02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:56.871]  Crystal meth, heroin, those are Schedule 2.
[02:44:57.671 --> 02:44:58.031]  You know?
[02:44:58.031 --> 02:44:59.233]  Cocaine is Schedule 2.
[02:44:59.233 --> 02:45:04.237]  Marijuana is more illegal and, you know, and supposedly more dangerous than all of that.
[02:45:04.237 --> 02:45:05.779]  Meanwhile, it's never killed anyone.
[02:45:05.779 --> 02:45:07.140]  Man, I always use this statistic.
[02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:09.362]  150 people die every year because coconuts fall on their head. 150.
[02:45:11.531 --> 02:45:11.932]  Zero.
[02:45:11.932 --> 02:45:22.943]  Well, a statistic we use whenever they're trying to ban guns using school shootings, and this has been the same every year for decades, there are more football deaths than school shooting deaths every single year.
[02:45:22.943 --> 02:45:27.027]  Here's a statistic I always use when people talk about mixed martial arts, how dangerous it is.
[02:45:27.928 --> 02:45:34.979]  More people have died from girls cheerleading since 1984 than have died doing martial arts.
[02:45:34.979 --> 02:45:36.181]  It's those big pyramids they do.
[02:45:36.181 --> 02:45:37.743]  They're like 20 feet in the air and fall in there.
[02:45:37.743 --> 02:45:38.565]  Let me throw them.
[02:45:38.565 --> 02:45:40.928]  Four people have died, four girls have died since 1980, I think 82 or 84.
[02:45:42.856 --> 02:45:45.877]  It's something like 30-something a year die in high school football.
[02:45:45.877 --> 02:45:46.777]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:45:46.777 --> 02:45:48.377]  High school football is rough, man.
[02:45:48.377 --> 02:45:52.158]  A lot of kids, if they don't die, they get debilitated.
[02:45:52.158 --> 02:46:01.080]  Listen, I got on the first string, and I was a little guy, and then they, when I was a freshman, sent me to varsity in a 4A school.
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:03.841]  And after that season, I said, I'm getting out of this.
[02:46:04.181 --> 02:46:08.362]  Yeah, there's a lot of guys who die.
[02:46:08.362 --> 02:46:15.785]  There was that one guy that committed suicide, a pro football player, really recently, he was in his 40s, and they said he had the brain of an 80-year-old man with Parkinson's.
[02:46:15.785 --> 02:46:20.466]  Oh, listen, a few times I'd have somebody run through and some giant black guy run over me and I'd be seeing stars.
[02:46:20.466 --> 02:46:21.866]  Oh, it was supposed to be a black guy.
[02:46:21.866 --> 02:46:23.827]  Well, yeah, of course it was a big black guy.
[02:46:23.827 --> 02:46:25.087]  No giant white guys run over you?
[02:46:25.087 --> 02:46:26.408]  Why would giant white guys run over me?
[02:46:26.408 --> 02:46:28.308]  Well, the black guy's just scarier.
[02:46:28.308 --> 02:46:30.089]  Well, no, just, yeah, yeah, I guess.
[02:46:31.294 --> 02:46:32.055]  Well no, that's you.
[02:46:32.055 --> 02:46:33.736]  You tended to run over me, yeah.
[02:46:33.736 --> 02:46:35.177]  The white guys kind of let you alone?
[02:46:35.177 --> 02:46:36.458]  No, they ran over me too.
[02:46:36.458 --> 02:46:42.703]  But I think the few times I got my bell really... I think the few times I really got my bell wrong, it was a black guy.
[02:46:42.703 --> 02:46:43.924]  Oh, there you go.
[02:46:43.924 --> 02:46:45.846]  The black athlete.
[02:46:45.846 --> 02:46:46.946]  They're taking over.
[02:46:46.946 --> 02:46:48.568]  What's happening in Ultimate Fighting with the athletes?
[02:46:49.348 --> 02:46:53.572]  Uh, well, the UFC is, uh, right now it's a really exciting time.
[02:46:53.572 --> 02:46:55.214]  There's a lot of great fights going on.
[02:46:55.214 --> 02:46:57.195]  You know, there's a lot of great champions.
[02:46:57.195 --> 02:46:58.236]  Next weekend is huge.
[02:46:58.236 --> 02:46:59.858]  It's BJ Penn versus George St.
[02:46:59.858 --> 02:47:00.739]  Pierre.
[02:47:00.739 --> 02:47:03.341]  BJ Penn is the 155 pound champion and George St.
[02:47:03.341 --> 02:47:09.586]  Pierre is the 170 pound champion and both of them are pound for pound in the top, you know, three or four guys in the world.
[02:47:09.586 --> 02:47:10.848]  You know, they're the elite.
[02:47:10.848 --> 02:47:12.269]  So they're little and they're super powerful.
[02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:13.470]  Yeah, well George St.
[02:47:13.470 --> 02:47:23.660]  Pierre is really about 185-190 and he diets down to 170, whereas BJ really walks around at like 165 and he bulked up to go to 170.
[02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:28.125]  So they're meeting in the middle, they're meeting at 170, and I think it's just an awesome fight.
[02:47:28.125 --> 02:47:30.947]  Just two guys that are just born to do this, you know?
[02:47:30.947 --> 02:47:34.431]  It's going to be incredible.
[02:47:34.431 --> 02:47:35.972]  So you're pretty excited about that?
[02:47:37.359 --> 02:47:38.620]  You want to go?
[02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:40.261]  You want to go to the UFC?
[02:47:40.261 --> 02:47:42.903]  Does the wife let you escape to Vegas for the weekend?
[02:47:42.903 --> 02:47:44.104]  My wife lets me do whatever I want.
[02:47:44.104 --> 02:47:46.045]  Look at you, you animal.
[02:47:46.045 --> 02:47:47.466]  Okay, I'll go to Vegas for the fight.
[02:47:47.466 --> 02:47:49.147]  If you want to go, I'll hook it up.
[02:47:49.147 --> 02:47:49.747]  Hook it up?
[02:47:49.747 --> 02:47:54.090]  I'll hook it up.
[02:47:54.090 --> 02:47:54.631]  That's crazy.
[02:47:54.631 --> 02:47:57.052]  Jason Burmiss would kill for that.
[02:47:57.052 --> 02:48:00.695]  The fella you talk to who fills in sometimes, last time you were on the air he was in studio with us.
[02:48:00.695 --> 02:48:02.376]  He's the guy from Loose Change?
[02:48:02.376 --> 02:48:03.556]  Yeah.
[02:48:03.556 --> 02:48:05.217]  Now what did he do with Loose Change?
[02:48:06.426 --> 02:48:07.446]  He did a lot of it.
[02:48:07.446 --> 02:48:10.267]  I mean, he worked on both the films.
[02:48:10.267 --> 02:48:16.128]  Now I know that Popular Science had a whole magazine article dedicated to... Yeah, that's Hearst Publishing.
[02:48:16.128 --> 02:48:16.969]  Hearst Publishing.
[02:48:16.969 --> 02:48:17.909]  Yeah, is that what that is?
[02:48:17.909 --> 02:48:23.010]  I mean, in the Encyclopedia Britannica, next to the word Yellow Journalism is Hearst Publishing.
[02:48:23.010 --> 02:48:30.252]  And they also own A&E, and they run these dramas where pot smokers are 9-11 truthers and they're killing people and are terrorists.
[02:48:30.452 --> 02:48:32.294]  I can play the clip, the latest one.
[02:48:32.294 --> 02:48:33.755]  So it's pure propaganda, and they lie.
[02:48:33.755 --> 02:48:40.902]  They say, in the Popular Mechanics book, they say NORAD only intercepted one plane in all of its history.
[02:48:40.902 --> 02:48:42.744]  Before 9-11, that was Payne Stewart.
[02:48:42.744 --> 02:48:49.911]  And then we go and get the NORAD records, and the NORAD spokesman, after Payne Stewart bragging, in this year we've already intercepted 167 aircraft.
[02:48:52.273 --> 02:48:57.578]  Everybody knows, pilots know, that if your plane gets off course around a storm, you know, they send up F-16s.
[02:48:57.578 --> 02:48:59.360]  So that's one lie.
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:03.004]  They also said that Building 7 fell because a fuel tank blew up.
[02:49:03.004 --> 02:49:07.167]  NIST admits that isn't the case.
[02:49:07.167 --> 02:49:09.350]  Now, the Building 7 thing, you know,
[02:49:10.723 --> 02:49:18.953]  If you look at the way it fell, I mean, it looks like a controlled demolition, like more so even than Building 1 and Building 2.
[02:49:18.953 --> 02:49:26.863]  Is it possible that it was just a flaw in the construction, that a gigantic raging fire inside the building caused it to collapse like that?
[02:49:26.863 --> 02:49:27.924]  Is it even possible?
[02:49:27.924 --> 02:49:28.625]  No, no, they've now...
[02:49:29.626 --> 02:49:32.187]  They've given five different reasons it fell, and now the sixth.
[02:49:32.187 --> 02:49:34.087]  They said the last five, they were wrong.
[02:49:34.087 --> 02:49:34.827]  Right.
[02:49:34.827 --> 02:49:36.348]  The new one is thermal expansion.
[02:49:36.348 --> 02:49:40.429]  It's never happened anywhere in a building before, but that's not even the issue.
[02:49:40.429 --> 02:49:50.091]  We have all these firefighter and police videos now where they're saying, get back, they're gonna blow it up, get back, and then BBC... So do you think that they set it up like when they were building it like this?
[02:49:50.151 --> 02:49:54.055]  I believe they meant to fly the Pennsylvania plane into it and something happened.
[02:49:54.055 --> 02:49:57.579]  And I had Pentagon people tell me that the Pentagon refused orders and did shoot the plane down.
[02:49:57.579 --> 02:50:02.385]  And that they meant later in that morning to have Flight 93 fly into it so it was already wired.
[02:50:02.385 --> 02:50:05.388]  And that was the CIA headquarters.
[02:50:05.388 --> 02:50:07.670]  Huh.
[02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:08.912]  So they still had to blow it up.
[02:50:10.242 --> 02:50:11.984]  So, but, this is what I don't understand.
[02:50:11.984 --> 02:50:16.891]  Do you believe that it was rigged, like, just, just prior to the attacks?
[02:50:16.891 --> 02:50:20.035]  Or do you think that it was constructed with all this explosives in it?
[02:50:20.035 --> 02:50:21.877]  Like, how do you think that they... Well, we found out.
[02:50:21.877 --> 02:50:22.458]  We found out.
[02:50:22.458 --> 02:50:25.422]  I mean, if you want me to go through it, I could have you back for an hour sometime.
[02:50:26.503 --> 02:50:28.164]  And have the physicists and scientists on.
[02:50:28.164 --> 02:50:32.926]  It turns out that they did special construction.
[02:50:32.926 --> 02:50:44.450]  And that NASA, and then the very guys on NIST who are doing the cover-up, are the experts on a putty thermite that they use to discouple rockets in their stages.
[02:50:44.450 --> 02:50:45.610]  And it's explosive.
[02:50:45.610 --> 02:50:46.671]  It cuts through things instantly.
[02:50:47.071 --> 02:50:51.934]  But they had to get through to the frame of the building to install this stuff, right?
[02:50:51.934 --> 02:50:57.478]  In 1999, they did a remodel and added new fireproofing and used a special company connected to the group.
[02:50:57.478 --> 02:51:01.620]  So they set this up from 1999 and they waited until... Stay there, stay there, here we go.
[02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:12.147]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:51:12.147 --> 02:51:13.968]  Garden in a can, garden in

[02:51:58.568 --> 02:52:07.350]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:52:07.350 --> 02:52:09.011]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:10.183 --> 02:52:11.544]  Who is the enemy?
[02:52:11.544 --> 02:52:12.345]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:12.345 --> 02:52:13.326]  This is his M.O.

[02:52:24.334 --> 02:52:29.979]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:30.679 --> 02:52:34.182]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.

[02:54:26.664 --> 02:54:31.589]  Hey, Joe Rogan, you were just saying, only in Austin, Texas would you have Alex Jones as the police chief.
[02:54:31.589 --> 02:54:33.030]  Yeah, well, the police chief was saying that.
[02:54:33.030 --> 02:54:34.131]  He was doing impressions of you.
[02:54:34.131 --> 02:54:35.012]  It's hilarious.
[02:54:35.012 --> 02:54:37.595]  He's going, one day closer to victory!
[02:54:37.595 --> 02:54:38.476]  I've got the documents!
[02:54:39.036 --> 02:54:40.258]  The police team's out there.
[02:54:40.258 --> 02:54:42.000]  I noticed he brought bodyguards, though.
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:43.221]  He's a little nervous of you.
[02:54:43.221 --> 02:54:44.103]  Nervous of you?
[02:54:44.103 --> 02:54:44.904]  What?
[02:54:44.904 --> 02:54:46.826]  He knows you're the ultimate fighting man.
[02:54:46.826 --> 02:54:48.588]  I'm just a talker.
[02:54:48.588 --> 02:54:49.690]  I just talk.
[02:54:49.690 --> 02:54:51.252]  You know, Joe, I know people that know you.
[02:54:51.252 --> 02:54:52.273]  You actually go to the gym.
[02:54:52.273 --> 02:54:54.776]  You get into big stuff with big guys.
[02:54:54.776 --> 02:54:56.118]  You actually train with the police, actually.
[02:54:56.118 --> 02:54:56.979]  You said a lot of cops.
[02:54:57.239 --> 02:54:58.039]  Yeah.
[02:54:58.039 --> 02:55:00.841]  And haven't you won some awards?
[02:55:00.841 --> 02:55:05.884]  When I was younger, yeah, I won a lot of Taekwondo tournaments and kickboxing fights.
[02:55:05.884 --> 02:55:07.545]  But yeah, I haven't done that in a long time.
[02:55:07.545 --> 02:55:10.166]  I haven't competed in, you know, several decades.
[02:55:10.166 --> 02:55:12.768]  And I had Chuck Norris on and I said, who would win between you and Bruce Lee?
[02:55:12.768 --> 02:55:15.489]  And he basically said, Bruce Lee was just an actor.
[02:55:15.489 --> 02:55:16.089]  I'm a champion.
[02:55:16.089 --> 02:55:17.050]  What do you think would happen?
[02:55:17.050 --> 02:55:19.711]  Yeah, that's kind of true.
[02:55:19.711 --> 02:55:21.312]  I had a bet on Chuck back in the day.
[02:55:21.312 --> 02:55:22.113]  Chuck was a badass.
[02:55:22.853 --> 02:55:24.194]  That was a huge Chuck Norris fan.
[02:55:24.194 --> 02:55:26.797]  When Chuck was 30 years old, how would he have done an open fight?
[02:55:26.797 --> 02:55:28.399]  He would have got his butt whipped because of the grappling?
[02:55:28.399 --> 02:55:30.180]  Well, he would have learned it.
[02:55:30.180 --> 02:55:30.941]  For sure.
[02:55:30.941 --> 02:55:31.482]  Guaranteed.
[02:55:31.482 --> 02:55:37.087]  If there was mixed martial arts around when Chuck Norris was competing, definitely he would have learned it.
[02:55:37.087 --> 02:55:43.774]  A guy who's a champion in anything, whether you're a champion in boxing, whether you're a champion in wrestling, most of it is your
[02:55:43.994 --> 02:55:44.174]  No.
[02:56:02.981 --> 02:56:08.146]  Hey guys, rotate the camera around so we can see the police chief in there.
[02:56:08.146 --> 02:56:11.990]  Let's get some of the guys out of the studio first so we have room.
[02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:16.634]  Let's rotate the camera around so we can see the police chief in there.
[02:56:16.634 --> 02:56:17.775]  No, this is the camera to rotate.
[02:56:17.775 --> 02:56:23.220]  If you rotate camera two... Alex is worried they're going to put him in a FEMA camp.
[02:56:23.220 --> 02:56:25.542]  If you put him in a FEMA camp, could it please be air-conditioned?
[02:56:26.331 --> 02:56:27.272]  Here, rotate it around.
[02:56:27.272 --> 02:56:28.293]  Oh, I asked him.
[02:56:28.293 --> 02:56:29.113]  Listen, I asked him last time.
[02:56:29.113 --> 02:56:35.758]  I said, the feds said... Look, I've got a woman going to a FEMA camp, charged under the Patriot Act, L.A.
[02:56:35.758 --> 02:56:38.220]  Times, for spilling a Bloody Mary on a plane.
[02:56:38.220 --> 02:56:39.701]  I've said this to you before and I'm going to say it again.
[02:56:39.701 --> 02:56:41.883]  Maybe that chick was a douchebag.
[02:56:42.463 --> 02:56:43.604]  She deserves to go to the FEMA camp!
[02:56:43.604 --> 02:56:44.464]  Is that possible?
[02:56:44.464 --> 02:56:45.224]  Is that possible?
[02:56:45.224 --> 02:56:59.951]  Is that possible that chick was a giant pain in the ass, and she was a pain in the ass to the flight attendants, then she was a pain in the ass to the cops that talked to her when she got off, maybe she screams and yells, maybe she likes to curse at people, maybe she can't control her temper, maybe she should be locked up, maybe she's just a pain in the ass.
[02:56:59.951 --> 02:57:03.213]  She should be charged outside the Bill of Rights under the Patriot Act.
[02:57:03.473 --> 02:57:04.614]  Maybe.
[02:57:04.614 --> 02:57:05.435]  Maybe her.
[02:57:05.435 --> 02:57:06.816]  Maybe just that one lady.
[02:57:06.816 --> 02:57:08.457]  Look at you groveling to the police!
[02:57:08.457 --> 02:57:10.039]  It's true, I'm licking their boots, Alex Jones!
[02:57:10.039 --> 02:57:11.660]  You turn me over to them!
[02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:15.923]  Listen, it's like... I'm doing it for the... I want the upper floor in the FEMA camp.
[02:57:15.923 --> 02:57:17.865]  Hey, let me tell you what... I want the view.
[02:57:17.865 --> 02:57:18.726]  It's like O'Brien.
[02:57:18.726 --> 02:57:22.829]  Winston thinks O'Brien's his friend, and when he's in the FEMA camp jail... Who's O'Brien?
[02:57:22.829 --> 02:57:23.410]  Who's Winston?
[02:57:23.410 --> 02:57:24.671]  The guy that tortures him in 1984.
[02:57:24.671 --> 02:57:27.993]  O'Brien walks in, and he says, they got you too?
[02:57:27.993 --> 02:57:29.395]  And he said, they got me a long time ago.
[02:57:30.335 --> 02:57:30.755]  Oh, I see.
[02:57:30.755 --> 02:57:32.156]  And he's the guy that's going to torture Winston.
[02:57:32.156 --> 02:57:33.477]  Well, that's what everybody's worried about, right?
[02:57:33.477 --> 02:57:34.357]  And that's what this is!
[02:57:34.357 --> 02:57:35.338]  Look, O'Brien!
[02:57:35.338 --> 02:57:37.419]  Here, rotate that camera around right there.
[02:57:37.419 --> 02:57:37.839]  Camera three.
[02:57:37.839 --> 02:57:39.400]  He's showing that he's going to lock you up.
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:40.700]  There's O'Brien.
[02:57:40.700 --> 02:57:42.661]  There's O'Brien inside there right now.
[02:57:42.661 --> 02:57:51.586]  See, now this has been my take always on police officers and soldiers, and if you want to start blaming the people that are running this world, that's one thing.
[02:57:51.586 --> 02:57:54.247]  But cops aren't getting paid for that.
[02:57:54.247 --> 02:57:56.188]  They're not the ones that are profiting off of it.
[02:57:56.188 --> 02:57:58.349]  And narcotics officers never plant drugs on people.
[02:57:58.709 --> 02:58:03.635]  Well, I think there's certainly a lot of shady stuff that goes on with narcs.
[02:58:03.635 --> 02:58:04.076]  For sure.
[02:58:04.076 --> 02:58:12.927]  Well, they're operating in a shady world, and they're watching these young black kids drive around in $150,000 Mercedes' when they can't even pay their rent.
[02:58:12.927 --> 02:58:14.729]  So put them in a FEMA camp, too!
[02:58:14.729 --> 02:58:16.211]  Put FEMA camps, everybody!
[02:58:17.108 --> 02:58:18.849]  As long as we get a nice air-conditioned building.
[02:58:18.849 --> 02:58:20.731]  Hell, we don't need the Bill of Rights.
[02:58:20.731 --> 02:58:24.894]  Hell, it's good they charged her with a Patriot Act and thousands of others in marijuana cases.
[02:58:24.894 --> 02:58:25.735]  She might.
[02:58:25.735 --> 02:58:27.616]  When you choose your neighbor, you're going to hate that lady.
[02:58:27.616 --> 02:58:31.619]  Wait, so put the marijuana smokers... Yapping kids.
[02:58:31.619 --> 02:58:33.361]  Use the Patriot Act on the marijuana smokers?
[02:58:33.361 --> 02:58:34.401]  They spill everything.
[02:58:34.401 --> 02:58:35.242]  Put them in the FEMA camp.
[02:58:35.242 --> 02:58:36.363]  It's not just bloody marriages they spill.
[02:58:36.363 --> 02:58:37.163]  Put them in the FEMA camp.
[02:58:37.163 --> 02:58:37.904]  They spill everything.
[02:58:37.904 --> 02:58:39.065]  They break through windows.
[02:58:39.065 --> 02:58:39.705]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:39.705 --> 02:58:40.386]  He's Joe Hogan.
[02:58:40.386 --> 02:58:41.327]  Stay with us.
[02:58:41.327 --> 02:58:44.129]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.020 --> 02:58:51.363]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.363 --> 02:58:52.004]  Hello, friends.
[02:58:52.004 --> 02:58:53.065]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.065 --> 02:58:57.809]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.809 --> 02:59:00.771]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.771 --> 02:59:03.813]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.813 --> 02:59:08.537]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.757 --> 02:59:09.877]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.877 --> 02:59:13.119]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.119 --> 02:59:20.122]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[02:59:40.110 --> 02:59:40.550]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:42.371]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.170 --> 02:59:56.552]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.552 --> 02:59:59.335]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:20.385 --> 03:00:24.187]  I'm surrounded by Joe Rogan, the police bootlicker.
[03:00:24.187 --> 03:00:25.088]  Hey, fella.
[03:00:25.088 --> 03:00:25.968]  I'm just joking.
[03:00:25.968 --> 03:00:26.889]  Don't put me in a stranglehold.
[03:00:26.889 --> 03:00:28.870]  I don't know how to counter your jiu-jitsu.
[03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:29.851]  We're friends.
[03:00:29.851 --> 03:00:30.551]  I know, I'm joking.
[03:00:30.551 --> 03:00:31.171]  Or are you not?
[03:00:31.171 --> 03:00:32.032]  I'm just teasing you.
[03:00:32.032 --> 03:00:34.153]  Hey, I'm going to come to the Friday Show.
[03:00:34.153 --> 03:00:36.194]  Alex Jones, Friday Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:36.194 --> 03:00:40.076]  Now, they're saying on their website some of the events are sold out.
[03:00:40.076 --> 03:00:41.817]  They're doing two shows tomorrow.
[03:00:41.817 --> 03:00:42.478]  Two shows Saturday?
[03:00:43.098 --> 03:00:43.838]  Two shows Saturday.
[03:00:43.838 --> 03:00:44.178]  You're doing one?
[03:00:44.178 --> 03:00:46.339]  One tonight, two shows tomorrow, two shows Saturday.
[03:00:46.339 --> 03:00:48.420]  And so people need to go to the website or call the number.
[03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:55.322]  Yeah, the website says everything is sold out, but if you go to the booth like, you know, tonight or today, you might be able to buy a few tickets.
[03:00:55.322 --> 03:00:58.743]  I was about to say, whenever... They save a few, they put a few aside.
[03:00:58.743 --> 03:01:00.064]  So there's a couple that are available.
[03:01:00.064 --> 03:01:01.344]  Hey, you want to offer the police chief one?
[03:01:01.344 --> 03:01:02.085]  Maybe he can go with us?
[03:01:02.085 --> 03:01:02.745]  That's good.
[03:01:02.745 --> 03:01:05.026]  Especially when I start talking about pot.
[03:01:05.026 --> 03:01:05.746]  I'm set up close.
[03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:10.904]  But I mean, seriously, they're putting people with pot charging them with terrorism.
[03:01:10.904 --> 03:01:12.426]  Are you for that?
[03:01:12.426 --> 03:01:13.727]  No, I'm not for that, obviously.
[03:01:13.727 --> 03:01:14.769]  Where's that?
[03:01:14.769 --> 03:01:15.850]  Who's charging who with terrorism?
[03:01:15.850 --> 03:01:16.371]  I can pull it up.
[03:01:16.371 --> 03:01:18.393]  Patriot Act being used in marijuana cases.
[03:01:18.393 --> 03:01:18.673]  Google it.
[03:01:18.673 --> 03:01:19.955]  Hilarious.
[03:01:19.955 --> 03:01:22.217]  And they don't get their Bill of Rights under it.
[03:01:22.217 --> 03:01:24.400]  It was meant for hardcore Al-Qaeda.
[03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:25.101]  They're definitely right.
[03:01:25.101 --> 03:01:26.202]  There's some terrorism going on.
[03:01:27.185 --> 03:01:34.092]  If you get really good weed, you get really good weed and you eat it like you're really good pot brownie, that's just, that is like an act of terrorism.
[03:01:34.092 --> 03:01:35.974]  That scares the hell out of you.
[03:01:35.974 --> 03:01:37.836]  You ever have a really good pot brownie?
[03:01:37.836 --> 03:01:38.577]  You get terrified.
[03:01:38.577 --> 03:01:40.499]  You want to curl up in a fetal position and just cry.
[03:01:41.817 --> 03:01:42.497]  It's terrorism.
[03:01:42.497 --> 03:01:44.938]  Joe, this has been one insane transmission.
[03:01:44.938 --> 03:01:48.300]  And we found out you like Ron Paul.
[03:01:48.300 --> 03:01:48.900]  Well, you know what?
[03:01:48.900 --> 03:01:51.301]  I've been pretty vocal about that.
[03:01:51.301 --> 03:01:55.523]  I think anybody who's looking at the system, there's no way to look at it and say, well, this is a mess.
[03:01:55.523 --> 03:01:56.723]  This needs to be revamped.
[03:01:56.723 --> 03:02:03.066]  And he was the only one that was offering a real radical restructuring of our government.
[03:02:03.066 --> 03:02:09.589]  And just staying out of other people's business, not being the policeman for the world, not getting involved in all their BS.
[03:02:10.049 --> 03:02:13.912]  By the way, Joe, there's another reason you're so successful in all the media you do.
[03:02:13.912 --> 03:02:14.612]  You're a hard-working guy.
[03:02:14.612 --> 03:02:22.278]  You got in late last night, you had three hours sleep, you did a couple hours at KLBJ this morning, and now you're in studio here and you're finally gonna get some sleep now before the show.
[03:02:22.278 --> 03:02:23.939]  Well, I'm doing it for you because you're my friend.
[03:02:23.939 --> 03:02:26.220]  I mean, you know, I've always enjoyed hanging out with you.
[03:02:26.220 --> 03:02:30.183]  You're a funny guy and I think you do a great service.
[03:02:30.183 --> 03:02:35.927]  I mean, even if people think that you're crazy, I think there's a lot of stuff that you say that's just irrefutable and people need to look at that.
[03:02:35.987 --> 03:02:37.128]  Well, I appreciate you, Joe.
[03:02:37.128 --> 03:02:40.933]  In the ten years I've known you, it's always time.
[03:02:40.933 --> 03:02:43.876]  We'll have Walker canes next week.
[03:02:43.876 --> 03:02:46.519]  That's on the way, bro.
[03:02:46.519 --> 03:02:48.661]  Then we're going to be in silver spacesuits as old men.
[03:02:48.661 --> 03:02:49.462]  You think so?
[03:02:49.462 --> 03:02:50.443]  Yeah, like little jetpacks.
[03:02:50.964 --> 03:02:51.544]  We're good to go.
[03:03:09.309 --> 03:03:13.431]  I don't smoke pot, but I'm for decriminalization.
[03:03:13.431 --> 03:03:15.632]  Because 87% of drug users only use it.
[03:03:15.632 --> 03:03:16.672]  We need to empty the prisons out.
[03:03:16.672 --> 03:03:18.293]  Well, not only that, how about this?
[03:03:18.293 --> 03:03:21.514]  How about all you're doing is, it's just an experience.
[03:03:21.514 --> 03:03:23.035]  You're not hurting anyone else.
[03:03:23.035 --> 03:03:27.777]  And who is one person to tell you what you can and can't experience?
[03:03:27.777 --> 03:03:31.078]  The argument that you're saving people from it is complete, total nonsense.
[03:03:31.078 --> 03:03:37.881]  There hasn't been a study ever done that shows that there's some sort of a negative health effect, especially to rational use of marijuana.
[03:03:38.641 --> 03:03:39.201]  Well, we know this.
[03:03:39.201 --> 03:03:41.623]  Cigarettes kill millions a year.
[03:03:41.623 --> 03:03:44.225]  Marijuana kills millions a year.
[03:03:44.225 --> 03:03:46.746]  Caffeine kills thousands of people every year.
[03:03:46.746 --> 03:03:48.387]  So does aspirin.
[03:03:48.387 --> 03:03:51.569]  Cigarettes kill 400,000 in this country every year.
[03:03:51.569 --> 03:03:56.853]  Alcohol kills 90,000 to 100,000 just of deaths of drinking themselves to death.
[03:03:57.293 --> 03:03:58.214]  I mean, it's amazing.
[03:03:58.214 --> 03:04:00.515]  Marijuana zero, ever.
[03:04:00.515 --> 03:04:07.960]  But, because of the fact that it's been demonized with propaganda from William Randolph Hearst and Harry Anslinger in the 30s up until today.
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:09.681]  William Randolph Hearst, that's Hearst Publishing.
[03:04:09.681 --> 03:04:10.421]  Exactly.
[03:04:10.421 --> 03:04:18.546]  The reason why, people don't understand, the reason why marijuana was initially made illegal was not because of the psychoactive effects of the plants, it was completely an economic issue.
[03:04:18.546 --> 03:04:23.209]  Jal Chemical didn't want people to wear polyester, not the hemp cotton.
[03:04:23.609 --> 03:04:23.689]  Yes.
[03:04:23.689 --> 03:04:27.111]  Hemp is a far more durable fiber than cotton.
[03:04:27.111 --> 03:04:28.812]  And unlike cotton, it grows everywhere.
[03:04:28.812 --> 03:04:29.392]  Exactly.
[03:04:29.392 --> 03:04:30.653]  And it's renewable.
[03:04:30.653 --> 03:04:32.774]  It's much more renewable than trees are.
[03:04:32.774 --> 03:04:38.397]  You can make paper out of it far easier and restore the area in a few months' time.
[03:04:38.397 --> 03:04:39.638]  You can have plants growing there again.
[03:04:39.838 --> 03:04:41.079]  You come into Austin once a year?
[03:04:41.079 --> 03:04:41.940]  I come in once a year.
[03:04:41.940 --> 03:04:43.922]  We've got to have you back in next time and I'm going to come see you.
[03:04:43.922 --> 03:04:44.062]  I will.
[03:04:44.062 --> 03:04:45.343]  I'm going to come see you.
[03:04:45.343 --> 03:04:46.304]  Friday night, buddy.
[03:04:46.304 --> 03:04:46.845]  Late show.
[03:04:46.845 --> 03:04:49.507]  If you want to go to the Friday night late show, you can sneak in.
[03:04:49.507 --> 03:04:54.032]  Alex Jones will be there, ladies and gentlemen, and we will be one step closer to victory.
[03:04:54.032 --> 03:04:56.554]  We have the documents to prove it.
[03:04:56.554 --> 03:04:59.757]  Alright, we'll be right back with the Austin Police Chief, Mr. Feimacamp.
[03:04:59.757 --> 03:05:00.158]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:04.094]  Right now the world is a scary place.
[03:05:04.094 --> 03:05:09.521]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[03:05:09.521 --> 03:05:14.108]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[03:05:14.108 --> 03:05:16.792]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[03:05:16.972 --> 03:05:26.979]  The first line of defense kit includes Nutri-Immune and Nutri-Defense, providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry, and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[03:05:26.979 --> 03:05:35.765]  Also included, the Nano-Mask Nano-Particular Antiviral Masks with replacement filters, providing supreme viral protection from airborne pathogens.
[03:05:35.765 --> 03:05:37.406]  And, the first line of defense wipes,
[03:05:37.566 --> 03:05:37.866]  I think so.
[03:06:01.502 --> 03:06:08.247]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:08.247 --> 03:06:10.889]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:10.889 --> 03:06:12.450]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:12.450 --> 03:06:13.250]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:13.250 --> 03:06:14.291]  This is his ammo.
[03:06:14.291 --> 03:06:15.612]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:15.612 --> 03:06:17.593]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:17.593 --> 03:06:24.758]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:24.758 --> 03:06:25.239]  Some U.S.
[03:06:25.239 --> 03:06:30.883]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:31.563 --> 03:06:35.084]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:35.084 --> 03:06:37.865]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:07:01.641 --> 03:07:05.166]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:07:05.166 --> 03:07:10.573]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:07:10.573 --> 03:07:15.279]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:07:16.581 --> 03:07:27.245]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:07:27.245 --> 03:07:33.008]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:07:33.008 --> 03:07:39.290]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:07:39.290 --> 03:07:40.311]  What about you?
[03:07:40.311 --> 03:07:42.251]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[03:07:51.356 --> 03:07:51.656]  Big Brother.
[03:08:07.660 --> 03:08:09.421]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.421 --> 03:08:11.182]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.182 --> 03:08:12.763]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.763 --> 03:08:14.323]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.323 --> 03:08:18.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.525 --> 03:08:26.409]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.409 --> 03:08:29.551]  What do you like?
[03:08:32.921 --> 03:08:36.524]  We have Chief Arte Cervado, the Austin Police Chief here.
[03:08:36.524 --> 03:08:38.705]  And he does have backup with him.
[03:08:38.705 --> 03:08:39.766]  They do have syringes.
[03:08:39.766 --> 03:08:42.448]  They want to draw blood from the entire office.
[03:08:42.448 --> 03:08:44.770]  Actually, for you, we want a urine sample.
[03:08:44.770 --> 03:08:45.150]  You do?
[03:08:45.150 --> 03:08:45.930]  You want a urine sample?
[03:08:45.930 --> 03:08:47.231]  Yes, we do.
[03:08:47.231 --> 03:08:47.852]  In a cup, though.
[03:08:47.852 --> 03:08:49.273]  Don't get any ideas.
[03:08:49.273 --> 03:08:49.773]  All right.
[03:08:49.773 --> 03:08:54.857]  Well, again, ladies and gentlemen, there is the Police Chief, live on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:54.857 --> 03:08:56.138]  You just styled your hair.
[03:08:56.138 --> 03:08:57.439]  I have a bad haircut today.
[03:08:57.439 --> 03:08:57.779]  No, no, no.
[03:08:57.779 --> 03:09:00.521]  But last time you were in here on a break, I was combing my hair.
[03:09:00.521 --> 03:09:01.181]  You made fun of me.
[03:09:02.639 --> 03:09:06.922]  Well, we're good looking guys, you know, we want to make sure that we're looking good for your audience.
[03:09:06.922 --> 03:09:08.103]  Hey, did you like meeting Joe Rogan?
[03:09:08.103 --> 03:09:09.524]  He's a good man, yeah.
[03:09:09.524 --> 03:09:12.127]  Actually, it was nice talking to him about John McCarthy.
[03:09:12.127 --> 03:09:14.769]  John McCarthy used to be the ref there for the UFC.
[03:09:14.769 --> 03:09:18.932]  He's a good friend of mine, I've known him for many years, and catching up on what's going on with him, too.
[03:09:18.932 --> 03:09:19.973]  So you're a UFC fan?
[03:09:20.743 --> 03:09:24.629]  Yeah, yeah, it's a great, you know, it's warriors, man.
[03:09:24.629 --> 03:09:31.820]  We come from a warrior culture, and it's good to see guys fight, and actually, I don't think it's as vicious as people think, try to make it out to be.
[03:09:31.820 --> 03:09:32.881]  There are some rules.
[03:09:32.881 --> 03:09:34.604]  Well, less folks die in this than in boxing.
[03:09:34.861 --> 03:09:36.161]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:09:36.161 --> 03:09:37.502]  I think it's safer.
[03:09:37.502 --> 03:09:42.984]  But historically, it's a sign of a society in decline when gladiatorial events become popular.
[03:09:42.984 --> 03:09:47.066]  Well, I think they've been popular with humanity throughout our history.
[03:09:47.066 --> 03:09:51.527]  So I don't know if it's a sign, but if it's a bad sign, we're in trouble because we've been doing it forever.
[03:09:51.527 --> 03:09:57.209]  There was a famous case in Miami where the cop union brought in two big fighters to fight each other.
[03:09:59.190 --> 03:10:01.511]  Did you ever hear about that case?
[03:10:01.511 --> 03:10:01.991]  Nah.
[03:10:01.991 --> 03:10:05.152]  Alex, I don't have the network of information that you have.
[03:10:05.152 --> 03:10:08.414]  You seem to be more in tune with what's going on in the world than some other folks.
[03:10:08.414 --> 03:10:09.314]  I don't know about that.
[03:10:09.314 --> 03:10:13.816]  Hey, everybody wants to hear this legendary imitation you do around town and do it out in the hall.
[03:10:13.816 --> 03:10:15.376]  Give us an Alex Jones imitation, Chief.
[03:10:15.376 --> 03:10:19.638]  Alex, you know, I remember when I asked you, hey, do you actually believe half the stuff you say?
[03:10:19.638 --> 03:10:21.459]  And you go, I can prove it all, Chief!
[03:10:21.459 --> 03:10:22.619]  I can prove it all!
[03:10:22.619 --> 03:10:24.460]  And, you know, tell me more!
[03:10:25.233 --> 03:10:25.874]  You're getting in my head!
[03:10:25.874 --> 03:10:29.137]  You're co-opting me, Chief!
[03:10:29.137 --> 03:10:30.439]  I love you, though, man.
[03:10:30.439 --> 03:10:35.945]  You're a great person that questions things, and that's not a bad thing.
[03:10:35.945 --> 03:10:44.895]  There's a reason we have a First Amendment of the Constitution and a free press, and I'm absolutely an advocate for free press, and that's why I'm here.
[03:10:44.895 --> 03:10:46.117]  I don't have nothing to hide.
[03:10:46.537 --> 03:10:48.499]  Except that needle you got for sucking blood.
[03:10:48.499 --> 03:10:57.685]  You know, hey, it's about safety and I know that some folks, there's a guy that came on your show, he's the vampire cop and... You know about everything!
[03:10:57.685 --> 03:10:58.806]  Are you listening to the show?
[03:10:58.806 --> 03:10:59.206]  Monitoring?
[03:10:59.206 --> 03:11:01.788]  I do, I listen to your show, I've watched some of your DVDs.
[03:11:01.788 --> 03:11:03.930]  Oh my god, are their FEMA camps ready?
[03:11:03.930 --> 03:11:08.433]  Yeah, your FEMA camp's ready, we've got a nice bed for you, satin sheets, just for you.
[03:11:08.433 --> 03:11:10.034]  Or did you want a water bed?
[03:11:10.034 --> 03:11:15.358]  Again, Austin Police Chief, you are more popular than some of the last police chiefs, I think that's because you are reaching out to the community.
[03:11:15.942 --> 03:11:17.423]  Well, I think that we're transparent.
[03:11:17.423 --> 03:11:21.745]  One of the organizational philosophies that I have is that you have to be transparent.
[03:11:21.745 --> 03:11:26.788]  Americans question government, they don't trust their government, and I think that's a good thing.
[03:11:26.788 --> 03:11:30.010]  Transparency breeds trust, and trust breeds cooperation.
[03:11:30.010 --> 03:11:35.493]  I think that the more that people trust us and know what we're doing, the better off we're all going to be as Americans.
[03:11:35.493 --> 03:11:40.316]  Hey, during the break, you were telling me a story, but we got cut off by having to go on air.
[03:11:40.316 --> 03:11:44.458]  You said you loved seeing that Geraldo Rivera confrontation.
[03:11:45.498 --> 03:11:57.925]  I was, it was very entertaining because I know you and Geraldo was doing his thing and here comes Alex Jones and I remember going into the office and going, hey Alex is at it at the RNC and it was fun to watch.
[03:12:00.006 --> 03:12:02.127]  And then I got arrested, even though we had a permit.
[03:12:02.127 --> 03:12:02.827]  You did get arrested?
[03:12:02.827 --> 03:12:06.067]  Yes, for a non-authorized sound device.
[03:12:06.067 --> 03:12:09.428]  But then the police had to let me go because people surrounding the police station were protesting.
[03:12:09.428 --> 03:12:10.749]  Yeah.
[03:12:10.749 --> 03:12:12.509]  And it's all on video.
[03:12:12.509 --> 03:12:14.369]  I'll give you a copy of it.
[03:12:14.369 --> 03:12:20.891]  And to make a long story short, they then pointed out that the ticket was a $200 fine and I shouldn't have been arrested.
[03:12:22.061 --> 03:12:23.082]  And so they let me go.
[03:12:23.082 --> 03:12:25.864]  So it should have been just a sight and release situation where they sight you?
[03:12:25.864 --> 03:12:26.585]  Yes, I did nothing.
[03:12:26.585 --> 03:12:29.627]  They said, come over here, you're not supposed to use that, you have a permit for that.
[03:12:29.627 --> 03:12:29.967]  And I said, no.
[03:12:29.967 --> 03:12:32.069]  And they said, put him in cuffs.
[03:12:32.069 --> 03:12:35.071]  I guess they wanted to incite the crowd of 300 screaming people.
[03:12:35.071 --> 03:12:36.392]  And then they drug me off.
[03:12:36.392 --> 03:12:39.655]  But let me tell you, Austin police are a little nicer on average than the New York police.
[03:12:39.655 --> 03:12:44.638]  Have you ever been in civilian clothes and had them call you scum and stuff?
[03:12:44.638 --> 03:12:45.039]  No.
[03:12:45.039 --> 03:12:49.422]  I try not to antagonize police officers when I'm off duty.
[03:12:49.662 --> 03:12:51.483]  But I don't mean antagonize.
[03:12:51.483 --> 03:12:57.645]  Well, you know, you start blowing into their ear with a bullhorn from five feet away, that might be a... That isn't what happened!
[03:12:57.645 --> 03:12:58.365]  I don't know if it is!
[03:12:58.365 --> 03:12:59.105]  Frame up!
[03:12:59.105 --> 03:13:00.266]  Frame up!
[03:13:00.266 --> 03:13:01.766]  I didn't say that's what happened.
[03:13:01.766 --> 03:13:02.646]  I'm just giving an example.
[03:13:02.646 --> 03:13:03.887]  You just implanted that idea.
[03:13:03.887 --> 03:13:04.507]  Antagonistic.
[03:13:04.907 --> 03:13:06.708]  Let's talk about what you're doing in Austin.
[03:13:06.708 --> 03:13:10.069]  I wanted to bring this up, because last time I didn't have the articles in front of me.
[03:13:10.069 --> 03:13:23.834]  And this woman, for yelling on the plane, she was charged under the Patriot Act as a terrorist, and then was held without bail and wasn't allowed to have a lawyer under the Terrorism Act, Section 802.
[03:13:23.834 --> 03:13:24.774]  Right there.
[03:13:24.774 --> 03:13:26.515]  I mean, is that a good use of the Patriot Act?
[03:13:26.515 --> 03:13:28.956]  They promised it wasn't going to be used except for Al-Qaeda.
[03:13:29.116 --> 03:13:42.448]  You know, I haven't seen this charge, but I will tell you that I think that the federal government takes disrupting flights and being disruptive in airlines much more seriously than they used to.
[03:13:42.448 --> 03:13:47.453]  But do they charge you under terrorism provisions that then take a lot of your rights away in court?
[03:13:47.453 --> 03:13:48.534]  Not that I'm aware of.
[03:13:48.534 --> 03:13:49.395]  No, it's right here.
[03:13:49.395 --> 03:13:51.336]  I don't have my reading glasses.
[03:13:51.336 --> 03:13:52.538]  Here, let me just read it to you.
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:14:01.945]  It says the incident aboard the Frontier flight ultimately led to Freeman's arrest and conviction for a federal felony defined as an act of terrorism under the Patriot Act.
[03:14:01.945 --> 03:14:04.187]  And she was tried under the Patriot Act.
[03:14:04.187 --> 03:14:08.189]  And it says here that she yelled at the flight attendant.
[03:14:08.189 --> 03:14:16.234]  Yeah, well I don't know what the legislative intent was from the Patriot Act, but it doesn't ring like that's what we had in mind.
[03:14:16.234 --> 03:14:20.917]  Well, I mean, you've spoken out against Fidel Castro, who's about to kick it, and you know, you escaped that.
[03:14:20.917 --> 03:14:21.958]  I mean, does that not sound like
[03:14:23.137 --> 03:14:24.278]  Cuba?
[03:14:24.278 --> 03:14:27.120]  Well, I don't know about, like I said, what was the penalty?
[03:14:27.120 --> 03:14:28.641]  Does it say on there?
[03:14:28.641 --> 03:14:31.404]  Uh, yeah, it's ten years in prison.
[03:14:31.404 --> 03:14:32.224]  I mean, it goes on.
[03:14:32.224 --> 03:14:36.347]  It says for people only raising their voice, not even cussing.
[03:14:36.347 --> 03:14:37.028]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:14:37.028 --> 03:14:38.109]  I'm not familiar with that case.
[03:14:38.109 --> 03:14:43.513]  I think you'd have to take a look at the... Remember, sometimes when you read news reports, they may not have all the information.
[03:14:43.513 --> 03:14:44.154]  No, no, no, no.
[03:14:44.154 --> 03:14:46.435]  Listen, before anybody talked about this, I read Section 802 of H.R.
[03:14:46.435 --> 03:14:47.056]  3162, passed October 27, 2001.
[03:14:50.163 --> 03:14:56.187]  And it said, Section 802, any action that endangers human life, that's a violation of any federal or state law, is hereby an act of terrorism.
[03:14:56.187 --> 03:14:58.349]  And it changed the old definition of the U.S.
[03:14:58.349 --> 03:14:58.929]  Code.
[03:14:58.929 --> 03:15:09.416]  And then it says you don't get due process, you don't get lawyers, we can spy on your lawyers, we can strip you of your citizenship, take you to Guantanamo Bay, and then use strong interrogation methods, which is a renamed torture.
[03:15:09.836 --> 03:15:15.860]  And then try you secretly before a tribunal, the president or his designate doesn't like the tribunal's response, then you would still be executed in secret.
[03:15:15.860 --> 03:15:20.984]  That's also nexuses in with the John Moore Defense Authorization Act and the Military Commissions Act.
[03:15:20.984 --> 03:15:26.568]  But right here it says, Freeman is one of at least 200 people on flights who have been convicted under the amended law.
[03:15:26.568 --> 03:15:31.411]  In most of these cases there was no evidence that the passengers attempted to hijack the airplane or physically attack any of the flight crew.
[03:15:31.411 --> 03:15:35.454]  Many have simply involved raising voices, foul language and drunken behavior.
[03:15:36.604 --> 03:15:37.244]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:15:37.244 --> 03:15:39.225]  I'm not familiar with the case, so I can't really comment on it.
[03:15:39.225 --> 03:15:43.307]  But I will say that there's a new administration in D.C.
[03:15:43.307 --> 03:15:51.471]  and I'm sure that they're looking at presidential directives of the past and different laws, and they may go in a different direction.
[03:15:51.471 --> 03:15:55.773]  I mean, this sounds like what the founders got mad at in 1776.
[03:15:55.773 --> 03:15:57.994]  Well, based on what you're saying, potentially, yeah.
[03:15:58.345 --> 03:15:59.586]  Were the founders evil?
[03:15:59.586 --> 03:16:10.432]  You know, I didn't know them, so I can't... No, but I mean, I have FBI on video in FEMA teaching police in the classified training that a police officer got us in Kansas City.
[03:16:10.432 --> 03:16:11.433]  The founding fathers were bad.
[03:16:12.558 --> 03:16:17.380]  You know what, I've been a cop for 22 years and I can't say I've ever heard that.
[03:16:17.380 --> 03:16:26.123]  And I would have a problem with somebody teaching my cops at the founding fathers of this country that I think framed an outstanding constitution.
[03:16:26.123 --> 03:16:34.987]  The spirit, which I'm thinking is a living document, that is a constitution is something that I think I've taken an oath to die for if I had to.
[03:16:36.716 --> 03:16:38.977]  Alright, and I appreciate you presenting yourself for interrogation.
[03:16:38.977 --> 03:16:44.620]  I'd like you to be able to talk about some of the... Remember, you do have to drive out of here.
[03:16:44.620 --> 03:16:45.420]  No, I'm kidding.
[03:16:45.420 --> 03:16:46.481]  Oh yeah, you are.
[03:16:46.481 --> 03:16:51.603]  A little double meaning.
[03:16:51.603 --> 03:16:54.384]  We are neighbors, too.
[03:16:54.384 --> 03:16:54.904]  Don't forget.
[03:16:54.904 --> 03:16:57.666]  He got a little aggressive last time after the show.
[03:16:57.666 --> 03:16:58.406]  Why did I get aggressive?
[03:16:58.406 --> 03:16:59.607]  You grabbed me by the arm.
[03:17:00.667 --> 03:17:03.489]  And squeezed it, and you said, you said, you really believe this stuff?
[03:17:03.489 --> 03:17:03.929]  And I said, yes.
[03:17:03.929 --> 03:17:04.969]  And you said, that's what you're crazy about.
[03:17:04.969 --> 03:17:05.830]  No, that's not what you said.
[03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:07.070]  You said, I can prove it all, Chief!
[03:17:07.070 --> 03:17:08.291]  I can prove it all!
[03:17:08.291 --> 03:17:11.412]  Then you started accusing me of trying to co-opt you.
[03:17:11.412 --> 03:17:11.913]  You're co-opting!
[03:17:11.913 --> 03:17:12.573]  This guy's good!
[03:17:12.573 --> 03:17:13.493]  This guy's good!
[03:17:13.493 --> 03:17:14.454]  Go see him again!
[03:17:14.454 --> 03:17:16.415]  We are.
[03:17:16.415 --> 03:17:19.716]  We're going to see you as the head of the Global FEMA Command.
[03:17:19.716 --> 03:17:21.097]  I don't think so.
[03:17:21.097 --> 03:17:23.658]  You wear a huge black leather uniform.
[03:17:23.658 --> 03:17:24.239]  Uh, no.
[03:17:24.239 --> 03:17:24.819]  Never.
[03:17:24.819 --> 03:17:26.100]  With like huge steel high heels.
[03:17:26.100 --> 03:17:26.980]  No, look at these uniforms.
[03:17:26.980 --> 03:17:27.800]  They're friendly.
[03:17:27.800 --> 03:17:28.481]  They're professional.
[03:17:30.662 --> 03:17:40.432]  I really think that we in Austin, I can only speak for Austin, I can't speak for any other entity, but we're about as transparent as we've been, and I think it's paying dividends.
[03:17:40.432 --> 03:17:43.335]  I think the community sees us in a different light, and that's not a bad thing.
[03:17:43.335 --> 03:17:46.958]  What I like is the black and whites, because when I'm speeding I can see them further away.
[03:17:46.958 --> 03:17:48.360]  You see, and then some people don't like them.
[03:17:49.161 --> 03:17:50.761]  Well, I like it because I can see it further away.
[03:17:50.761 --> 03:17:52.402]  The old white ones were hard for me to see.
[03:17:52.402 --> 03:17:54.662]  Well, especially when everything's white.
[03:17:54.662 --> 03:17:55.702]  All the cars are white here.
[03:17:55.702 --> 03:17:58.103]  The reason that we want to go to Buckingham... Visibility.
[03:17:58.103 --> 03:17:58.963]  High visibility.
[03:17:58.963 --> 03:18:01.763]  Look, my job is to try to deter crime.
[03:18:01.763 --> 03:18:04.044]  I mean, once crime's occurred, we've already failed.
[03:18:04.044 --> 03:18:10.685]  So, by having a highly visible police car, we hope that it has a deterrent effect on people committing crimes.
[03:18:10.685 --> 03:18:14.445]  Especially now with the economic downturn, where I think that people... Oh, crime's going up.
[03:18:14.445 --> 03:18:15.085]  It's going up.
[03:18:15.085 --> 03:18:18.346]  And people that normally would not turn to crime,
[03:18:19.368 --> 03:18:23.421]  That might want to feed their family may turn to it and so we have to be highly visible as a deterrent.
[03:18:24.963 --> 03:18:27.564]  Well, I mean, I've seen the statistics, and I'm glad you'll admit it's going up.
[03:18:27.564 --> 03:18:30.604]  A lot of police chiefs don't want to admit it's going up, but it is exploding.
[03:18:30.604 --> 03:18:36.045]  It is, and we try not to, you know, it is what it is.
[03:18:36.045 --> 03:18:45.267]  You know, you try your best, and in tight economic times, we need to make sure that we as a police department, that we're positioned to keep people safe, because that's our primary function.
[03:18:45.267 --> 03:18:47.728]  I think the primary function of government is to keep people safe.
[03:18:47.728 --> 03:18:49.968]  Well, I'll say one good thing that did happen with the Austin Police.
[03:18:49.968 --> 03:18:52.949]  My parents were out of town, and somebody kind of kicked in the back door, and the alarm went off.
[03:18:53.729 --> 03:19:00.752]  Within two minutes of the alarm going off, the police were there, they went in and checked the house, closed the door, waited for me to get there.
[03:19:00.752 --> 03:19:01.252]  Excellent.
[03:19:01.252 --> 03:19:03.153]  And I drove over and they were very nice.
[03:19:03.153 --> 03:19:03.813]  Outstanding.
[03:19:03.813 --> 03:19:10.176]  You know, we instituted, because you don't have an empty checkbook as a police department.
[03:19:10.176 --> 03:19:12.517]  The taxpayers only have so much money they can give us.
[03:19:12.517 --> 03:19:15.358]  So we now have what's called priority one hot shot calls.
[03:19:16.338 --> 03:19:24.584]  When certain crimes are occurring, we actually respond with lights and sirens now, Code 3, and that's had a really tremendously positive impact on our response times.
[03:19:24.584 --> 03:19:27.326]  Also, it makes the thieves paranoid, because they hear them.
[03:19:27.326 --> 03:19:28.667]  You know what?
[03:19:28.667 --> 03:19:32.010]  What's so funny is that you might have critics out there, and you got it.
[03:19:32.010 --> 03:19:35.052]  You right away figured out why we're doing that, you know?
[03:19:35.052 --> 03:19:39.175]  The comfort level of the crooks, because they hear those sirens, they don't know where they're going.
[03:19:39.175 --> 03:19:44.539]  We've actually been going to a separate hotshot call, one instance where some guys were robbing us.
[03:19:44.539 --> 03:19:45.580]  And it flushes another one out.
[03:19:45.720 --> 03:19:49.183]  Yes, and they hadn't even gotten the money from the restaurant yet.
[03:19:49.183 --> 03:19:50.885]  They heard our police sirens.
[03:19:50.885 --> 03:19:53.027]  They left.
[03:19:53.027 --> 03:19:55.209]  And then we weren't even going to that car.
[03:19:55.209 --> 03:19:55.830]  Wow.
[03:19:55.830 --> 03:19:59.393]  Police Chief Arte Cervedo, quite a trooper coming in to run the gauntlet.
[03:19:59.393 --> 03:20:00.675]  We'll be right back after this quick break.

[03:21:01.363 --> 03:21:03.525]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:21:03.525 --> 03:21:05.946]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:21:05.946 --> 03:21:08.568]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:21:08.568 --> 03:21:09.769]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:11.470]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:21:11.470 --> 03:21:14.372]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:21:14.372 --> 03:21:18.755]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:21:18.755 --> 03:21:19.576]  Do you listen?
[03:21:27.658 --> 03:21:32.521]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:32.521 --> 03:21:33.622]  An inside job.
[03:21:36.312 --> 03:21:37.792]  How dare you!
[03:21:37.792 --> 03:21:43.834]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:43.834 --> 03:21:46.715]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:46.715 --> 03:21:52.937]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[03:21:58.298 --> 03:22:00.759]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:22:01.508 --> 03:22:05.631]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[03:22:05.631 --> 03:22:18.340]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[03:22:18.340 --> 03:22:18.780]  The U.S.
[03:22:18.780 --> 03:22:24.764]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[03:22:24.764 --> 03:22:26.986]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[03:22:28.826 --> 03:22:29.927]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[03:22:29.927 --> 03:22:32.889]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[03:22:32.889 --> 03:22:39.333]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[03:22:39.333 --> 03:22:42.756]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[03:22:56.741 --> 03:22:57.162]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:57.162 --> 03:22:57.985]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke.
[03:23:07.857 --> 03:23:18.864]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[03:23:18.864 --> 03:23:26.909]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you will understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[03:23:26.909 --> 03:23:33.974]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[03:23:33.974 --> 03:23:35.335]  Food is an everyday need.
[03:23:35.868 --> 03:23:41.593]  The 3 Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[03:23:41.593 --> 03:23:44.996]  The 3 Day Responder, $21.95.
[03:23:44.996 --> 03:23:48.580]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[03:23:48.580 --> 03:23:51.322]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:23:51.322 --> 03:23:53.524]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:24:10.595 --> 03:24:13.638]  Chief, we got cut off by the break, and you're good for the rest of the hour, right?
[03:24:13.638 --> 03:24:14.278]  Yes, yes.
[03:24:14.278 --> 03:24:17.561]  Okay, good.
[03:24:17.561 --> 03:24:21.024]  You were continuing with the visibility of the police to...
[03:24:25.039 --> 03:24:33.925]  So anyway, you know, by having that Code 3 response, it reduces our response times and instills a sense of urgency in our police officers.
[03:24:33.925 --> 03:24:38.047]  And I think it diminishes the comfort level for the crooks.
[03:24:38.047 --> 03:24:41.729]  And so we had a guy, like I said, robbing a pizza place.
[03:24:41.729 --> 03:24:43.851]  Our guys are going to another priority one call.
[03:24:43.851 --> 03:24:45.151]  They hear the sirens.
[03:24:45.151 --> 03:24:45.672]  They split.
[03:24:45.672 --> 03:24:46.712]  Don't even take any money.
[03:24:46.712 --> 03:24:48.193]  Don't hurt anybody.
[03:24:48.193 --> 03:24:50.415]  And so we were able to thwart a robbery.
[03:24:51.135 --> 03:24:53.936]  Just by changing our response protocol.
[03:24:53.936 --> 03:24:55.036]  It's a good thing.
[03:24:55.036 --> 03:25:01.577]  Well, I actually don't speed that much, but it actually has helped me a few times, seeing the black and white.
[03:25:01.577 --> 03:25:09.119]  But I've noticed what the police are doing, especially because you've got to raise revenue because the economy's down, is that the police always wait at the bottom of highway hills.
[03:25:09.119 --> 03:25:16.161]  And so I've got to put my car always on cruise control now, which then becomes a problem when I remember to slow down, because if I don't,
[03:25:16.801 --> 03:25:27.887]  I'm going 60 on, say, Capitol Hill, Texas, and there they are, waiting at the bottom, and I look, and I'm going 67, and I've got a... I mean, literally, the last few tickets I got, I guess I got one about a year ago, I mean, I'm not...
[03:25:29.013 --> 03:25:31.936]  And used to the cops wouldn't give you a ticket if you're going five, six miles over.
[03:25:31.936 --> 03:25:32.977]  Now they're doing it.
[03:25:32.977 --> 03:25:37.261]  And I don't think that's fair when they're waiting on a hill, hoping you speed up down the hill.
[03:25:37.261 --> 03:25:37.862]  Yeah.
[03:25:37.862 --> 03:25:46.070]  Well, actually, our power enforcement team usually looks at crash data and when they decide where to prioritize their patrol.
[03:25:46.070 --> 03:25:49.454]  I'd have to look at what hill you're talking about specifically to see what the crash data is.
[03:25:49.454 --> 03:25:50.835]  You know, they're always the bottom of hills.
[03:25:51.636 --> 03:25:58.200]  Well, but traditionally, depending on how deep of a hill it is, crashes usually occur more because of that reason.
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:26:01.782]  People drive very fast going down the hill.
[03:26:01.782 --> 03:26:03.983]  And then going uphill, what happens?
[03:26:03.983 --> 03:26:04.864]  Slow down.
[03:26:04.864 --> 03:26:06.084]  Well, no.
[03:26:06.084 --> 03:26:09.286]  People end up getting fatality crashes because they're in and out of traffic.
[03:26:09.286 --> 03:26:10.527]  The ones that are in a hurry.
[03:26:10.527 --> 03:26:15.090]  And what'll happen is you have the big rigs, the big trucks that can't really go fast up the hill.
[03:26:15.090 --> 03:26:20.853]  And a car will change lanes and here comes this guy and all of a sudden we're ruined and be decapitated by driving like maniacs.
[03:26:20.933 --> 03:26:27.318]  Well, since I had children, I haven't even had a fender bender, because once you have children, they're with you, and you really start thinking about driving better.
[03:26:27.318 --> 03:26:32.543]  And I see these people that zoom around me for no reason, even when I'm in the slow lane, and now I get mad at them.
[03:26:32.543 --> 03:26:38.188]  I'm like the old man who used to stand out there yelling at me in high school when I'd speed through the neighborhood, because now I'm that old man.
[03:26:38.188 --> 03:26:48.036]  Yeah, well, you see, and the problem is in our country that we lose, every two and a half years, the equivalent of the number of troops that died in Vietnam over ten years on our highways.
[03:26:48.036 --> 03:26:48.837]  Fifty-eight thousand.
[03:26:49.577 --> 03:27:00.791]  And 50% of those on a national level, nearly half, are drunk driving related, which is why I'm really aggressive when it comes to... Well, Chief, but I mean, if you want to stop the drunks, this is what I don't like.
[03:27:00.791 --> 03:27:02.974]  A lot of nights I work till midnight up here.
[03:27:02.974 --> 03:27:04.776]  I'm working on a film right now about Obama.
[03:27:04.776 --> 03:27:05.497]  I left at midnight.
[03:27:06.237 --> 03:27:12.300]  And that's when the cops are out looking for drunks, and they get on my tail, other people's tails, and I'm driving home, and why run checkpoints?
[03:27:12.300 --> 03:27:13.781]  Why take blood?
[03:27:13.781 --> 03:27:17.563]  You can see drunks every night driving home, I see drunks.
[03:27:17.563 --> 03:27:23.245]  They either drive real slow, or they drive fast, or they speed up and slow down and they're drifting around, and I see drunks every night.
[03:27:23.245 --> 03:27:24.806]  I mean, how could the police not catch them?
[03:27:25.026 --> 03:27:25.947]  Well, no, we do catch them.
[03:27:25.947 --> 03:27:27.027]  The problem isn't catching them.
[03:27:27.027 --> 03:27:33.331]  The problem is, the second part of that is we need to get the evidence to be able to hold them accountable for two reasons.
[03:27:33.331 --> 03:27:41.555]  One, we want to get the conviction, not because we want to punish these folks, but because we want through that conviction comes requirements to go to some educational programs.
[03:27:41.555 --> 03:27:46.798]  But that sets the precedent when you're out there with injectors sucking blood on the side of the road.
[03:27:46.798 --> 03:27:51.281]  I mean, if this is constitutional, why wasn't it done before?
[03:27:53.086 --> 03:27:55.928]  Because it's a matter of people not exercising some leadership.
[03:27:55.928 --> 03:27:56.589]  Let me just say this.
[03:27:56.589 --> 03:27:57.690]  But is it a legal warrant?
[03:27:57.690 --> 03:28:00.132]  Because there are these rubber stamp warrants.
[03:28:00.132 --> 03:28:01.172]  We talked about that.
[03:28:01.172 --> 03:28:02.494]  Well, here's the issue.
[03:28:02.494 --> 03:28:14.363]  If our officers have to prepare what's called a probable cause declaration, you know that in our city our police officers have video cameras in their car where the stop is taped and the actions of the suspect are captured on tape.
[03:28:14.363 --> 03:28:16.125]  If our officers describe behavior
[03:28:16.885 --> 03:28:23.949]  Uh-huh, the Supreme Court just ruled, as you know last week, I have it here on the stack, that the motion to suppress isn't good anymore and the police can even be wrong.
[03:28:23.949 --> 03:28:27.431]  It doesn't say by accident, on purpose, and still that case won't be thrown out.
[03:28:44.381 --> 03:28:46.182]  Yeah, I'm familiar with that.
[03:28:46.182 --> 03:28:59.668]  I read in a paper the other day, but I think when there's an intentional, malicious, there's a difference between a mistake and falsely preparing a probable cause declaration, or annoyingly provide, first of all, it's a crime.
[03:28:59.668 --> 03:29:03.049]  If I describe behavior that's not, and I'm not even close.
[03:29:03.049 --> 03:29:05.691]  But attorney generals don't go after cops for that.
[03:29:05.691 --> 03:29:07.872]  Well, we do get cops convicted every once in a while.
[03:29:07.872 --> 03:29:10.613]  Every day I read about police caught planting drugs on people.
[03:29:11.533 --> 03:29:17.200]  Well I can tell you, it hasn't happened since I've been here and we catch somebody planting drugs, I think you know how I feel about accountability.
[03:29:17.200 --> 03:29:21.586]  We will hold our people accountable because the majority of my cops are excellent, hardworking professionals.
[03:29:21.586 --> 03:29:27.794]  I'm not just saying that because you're here, I've been all over the country and I want to say about the nicest police in the country are Austin, but I'm not saying that's too nice.
[03:29:28.917 --> 03:29:34.021]  I mean, I'll never forget a year and a half ago, Perry violates the Federal Law Logan Act.
[03:29:34.021 --> 03:29:36.323]  He goes to Bilderberg, he brags about it.
[03:29:36.323 --> 03:29:40.406]  I'm bullhorning him and the Austin PD walks up and says, we're going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[03:29:40.406 --> 03:29:43.288]  And I said, I know Austin's lost a bunch of lawsuits, you better not.
[03:29:43.288 --> 03:29:46.210]  Well, I'll tell you the story when we get back.
[03:29:46.210 --> 03:29:49.673]  Because I had to sit there and I didn't want to be in a confrontation with him.
[03:29:49.673 --> 03:29:51.775]  He was trying to violate my First Amendment.
[03:29:51.775 --> 03:29:53.176]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.176 --> 03:29:54.677]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.684 --> 03:29:58.374]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.259 --> 03:30:10.325]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[03:30:10.325 --> 03:30:11.926]  You need the Paclite.
[03:30:11.926 --> 03:30:20.173]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.

[03:30:54.800 --> 03:31:08.376]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:31:08.376 --> 03:31:10.058]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:31:11.010 --> 03:31:12.551]  But who is the enemy?
[03:31:12.551 --> 03:31:13.351]  Bin Laden.
[03:31:13.351 --> 03:31:14.312]  This is his M.O.
[03:31:14.312 --> 03:31:15.712]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:31:15.712 --> 03:31:17.713]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:31:17.713 --> 03:31:24.857]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:31:24.857 --> 03:31:25.337]  Some U.S.
[03:31:25.337 --> 03:31:31.000]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:31:31.680 --> 03:31:35.561]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:31:35.561 --> 03:31:45.663]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:31:45.663 --> 03:31:46.883]  Fabled Enemies.

[03:32:27.662 --> 03:32:29.783]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.

[03:33:12.705 --> 03:33:12.965]  I think.
[03:33:39.174 --> 03:33:42.496]  Look, I know we've had callers holding for an hour and a half, two hours.
[03:33:42.496 --> 03:33:46.019]  We're just not going to be able to take calls right now.
[03:33:46.019 --> 03:33:48.642]  We're all for Joe Rogan or Bob Chapman before him.
[03:33:48.642 --> 03:33:49.382]  I apologize.
[03:33:49.382 --> 03:33:51.444]  Got a bunch of big guests tomorrow as well.
[03:33:51.444 --> 03:33:55.407]  I'll try to make some time to take your calls because I am torn between
[03:33:57.748 --> 03:33:59.630]  Yeah, where was this at?
[03:34:12.305 --> 03:34:33.189]  uh... west texas now that's what about tommy chong the fed federal case it meant with the uh... marijuana pipes he was selling his son was that they sent an informant in to to to mail the pipe to a city where it was illegal to bust him and they still convicted him because they refused over and over again to sell the pipe to the city i mean i mean that's that's... who's this?
[03:34:33.189 --> 03:34:33.930]  Tommy Chong?
[03:34:33.930 --> 03:34:35.190]  Yeah, Tommy Chong.
[03:34:35.190 --> 03:34:36.590]  He spent years in prison for it.
[03:34:36.590 --> 03:34:37.610]  I'm not familiar with him.
[03:34:37.610 --> 03:34:38.451]  You always bring up cases.
[03:34:38.451 --> 03:34:39.411]  Cheech and Chong!
[03:34:39.411 --> 03:34:39.931]  Cheech and Chong!
[03:34:39.931 --> 03:34:40.431]  Oh, that guy!
[03:34:41.058 --> 03:34:43.619]  Oh yeah, they made some good movies when I was growing up.
[03:34:43.619 --> 03:34:45.459]  Yeah, but that's not right, man.
[03:34:45.459 --> 03:34:46.920]  Yeah, I'm not familiar with it.
[03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:50.141]  You always ask me about stuff I'm not familiar with.
[03:34:50.141 --> 03:34:52.982]  Yeah, but I mean, how do they have informants?
[03:34:52.982 --> 03:34:55.662]  An informant could come in here and plant something.
[03:34:55.662 --> 03:34:57.663]  I mean, none of us are using any drugs, nothing.
[03:34:57.663 --> 03:35:00.104]  Well, so an informant got him his...
[03:35:01.354 --> 03:35:02.894]  Mail something, talk to him, mail something.
[03:35:02.894 --> 03:35:09.155]  They went and got a job there in the city that had a law against it.
[03:35:09.155 --> 03:35:10.676]  There was a federal case doing it with the city.
[03:35:10.676 --> 03:35:12.096]  You know, they're out in California.
[03:35:12.096 --> 03:35:13.216]  This is in Ohio or whatever.
[03:35:13.216 --> 03:35:15.516]  I think it was Ohio.
[03:35:15.516 --> 03:35:21.998]  And they got somebody to get a job there at the office and then they kept catching them.
[03:35:21.998 --> 03:35:24.678]  Should have fired them trying to mail this pipe to the city.
[03:35:24.678 --> 03:35:25.698]  They knew it was a setup.
[03:35:25.698 --> 03:35:30.679]  And then the employee, who was the informant, mailed the pipe and then Tommy Chong goes to prison for it.
[03:35:32.028 --> 03:35:41.590]  Well, you know what, I'm not familiar with that, but it would seem to me that the person that mailed it, unless they mailed it out the direction of the employer, may be more culpable.
[03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:43.870]  But their overall thing was to mail everything out.
[03:35:43.870 --> 03:35:46.331]  But they told them, don't mail to this city.
[03:35:46.331 --> 03:35:47.151]  This is on record!
[03:35:47.151 --> 03:35:47.551]  Yeah.
[03:35:47.551 --> 03:35:54.432]  And then the feds raided the maker of the film and confiscated 10,000 of them, but that only made it explode and blow up, and now it's on Showtime.
[03:35:54.432 --> 03:35:54.932]  Really?
[03:35:54.932 --> 03:35:55.752]  Yeah.
[03:35:55.752 --> 03:35:57.173]  I'll have to check that out.
[03:35:57.173 --> 03:35:57.633]  Yeah.
[03:35:57.633 --> 03:35:58.113]  I haven't seen it.
[03:35:58.800 --> 03:36:03.021]  You know, instead of me interrogating you, would you like to interrogate me, Police Chief Art Acevedo?
[03:36:03.021 --> 03:36:03.721]  Yes.
[03:36:03.721 --> 03:36:06.282]  How often do you see black helicopters?
[03:36:06.282 --> 03:36:07.482]  I'm kidding.
[03:36:07.482 --> 03:36:13.303]  Actually, no, I gotta tell you something, because people ask me, hey, they can't believe that I come on Alex Jones.
[03:36:13.303 --> 03:36:27.607]  And I always tell folks, I don't care how far-fetched you think somebody may be, and I'm not saying you are or you're not, I think on some issues, and I won't identify them, but on some issues, you, I probably, I kind of agree with you on some of your philosophy.
[03:36:28.627 --> 03:36:45.792]  But I really believe that government has to be responsible and responsive to people, and you obviously have a following, and that's why I'm here, because if you have questions or your viewers or listeners have questions, we want to answer them, especially as they pertain here to the city of Austin.
[03:36:45.792 --> 03:36:47.273]  Well, it's very nice of you to come in.
[03:36:47.273 --> 03:36:49.473]  I was telling you I'd tell you that story.
[03:36:49.473 --> 03:36:52.314]  I'm out there bullhorning the governor at an event.
[03:36:53.118 --> 03:36:56.779]  And about ten police show up and he comes over and he goes, Alex, come here, I want to talk to you.
[03:36:56.779 --> 03:36:57.920]  It was the commander.
[03:36:57.920 --> 03:36:58.680]  It's all on video.
[03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:00.881]  My cameras are stuck in his face and he thinks he's whispering.
[03:37:00.881 --> 03:37:01.881]  We've got a shotgun mic.
[03:37:01.881 --> 03:37:02.801]  We're picking it all up.
[03:37:02.801 --> 03:37:03.722]  This is on YouTube.
[03:37:03.722 --> 03:37:04.162]  Yeah.
[03:37:04.162 --> 03:37:06.783]  And he goes, if you don't leave, we're going to arrest all of you.
[03:37:06.783 --> 03:37:09.884]  And I said, listen, I know I need a permit to block a road or a street.
[03:37:09.884 --> 03:37:10.104]  Right.
[03:37:10.104 --> 03:37:11.064]  This is First Amendment.
[03:37:11.064 --> 03:37:12.244]  The city of Austin's lawsuits.
[03:37:12.244 --> 03:37:14.005]  The state police have lawsuits in Austin.
[03:37:14.005 --> 03:37:14.725]  A whole bunch of them.
[03:37:14.725 --> 03:37:17.346]  I said, New York's losing a bunch of suits right now.
[03:37:17.346 --> 03:37:18.106]  I said, I'm not leaving.
[03:37:18.106 --> 03:37:18.666]  He goes, fine.
[03:37:18.666 --> 03:37:19.947]  And they had the riot police
[03:37:20.967 --> 03:37:22.028]  How long ago was that?
[03:37:22.028 --> 03:37:23.288]  Is it my guys or is it state police?
[03:37:40.419 --> 03:37:40.919]  It was your guys.
[03:37:40.919 --> 03:37:41.860]  It was a year and a half ago.
[03:37:41.860 --> 03:37:42.700]  You must have just gotten here.
[03:37:42.700 --> 03:37:46.923]  But the point is, is that then another commander comes up and goes, we're asking you to leave.
[03:37:46.923 --> 03:37:48.744]  And I said, but you're not telling me to.
[03:37:48.744 --> 03:37:52.646]  And then they, and I said, look, I don't want to be your enemy, but you can't be an enemy of the First Amendment.
[03:37:52.646 --> 03:37:54.707]  I said, go ahead and arrest me, but I'm going to sue you.
[03:37:54.707 --> 03:37:58.929]  And if you can't beat the rap, you know, I mean, you can beat the rap, but you can't beat the riot.
[03:37:58.929 --> 03:37:59.769]  And they understood what that meant.
[03:37:59.769 --> 03:38:01.851]  They left me alone and the big riot police left.
[03:38:01.851 --> 03:38:03.411]  But I mean, you know.
[03:38:03.411 --> 03:38:06.413]  Yeah, I'd be interested in seeing that video.
[03:38:06.413 --> 03:38:07.113]  Guys, pull up
[03:38:08.763 --> 03:38:09.643]  Look at the name of the video.
[03:38:09.643 --> 03:38:10.904]  It's on YouTube.
[03:38:10.904 --> 03:38:12.724]  Special, we did.
[03:38:12.724 --> 03:38:16.025]  YouTube, Alex Jones protesting Perry.
[03:38:16.025 --> 03:38:17.226]  Cops.
[03:38:17.226 --> 03:38:17.906]  That should bring it up.
[03:38:17.906 --> 03:38:20.107]  I mean, if you've got time after the show, I'll pull it up for you.
[03:38:20.107 --> 03:38:21.787]  Yeah, no, actually I can do it at home.
[03:38:21.787 --> 03:38:23.928]  I YouTube you on a regular basis.
[03:38:23.928 --> 03:38:25.889]  But I mean, he's on video.
[03:38:25.889 --> 03:38:28.149]  Oh, is he going to get in trouble or is he going to get promoted?
[03:38:28.149 --> 03:38:29.450]  No, we don't promote problems.
[03:38:29.450 --> 03:38:30.090]  We deal with them.
[03:38:30.717 --> 03:38:31.718]  Yeah.
[03:38:31.718 --> 03:38:34.419]  But why would he come over and say, we're going to arrest you?
[03:38:34.419 --> 03:38:40.942]  You know what, maybe because we do have an ordinance on using the amplified systems and bullhorns without a permit.
[03:38:40.942 --> 03:38:42.162]  You have to have a permit here.
[03:38:42.162 --> 03:38:44.564]  They could have written me a ticket and then if I kept doing it, arrested me.
[03:38:44.564 --> 03:38:46.705]  And then after the ticket, you'd arrest him.
[03:38:46.705 --> 03:38:48.245]  Then you'd escalate up to an arrest.
[03:38:48.245 --> 03:38:49.686]  But he didn't say the bullhorn.
[03:38:49.686 --> 03:38:50.046]  Yeah.
[03:38:50.046 --> 03:38:51.487]  He said this protest.
[03:38:52.369 --> 03:38:58.292]  Yeah, I don't think you can arrest somebody specifically for protesting just for the sake of protesting.
[03:38:58.292 --> 03:38:59.373]  It depends on what you're doing.
[03:38:59.373 --> 03:39:00.494]  As long as you don't block streets.
[03:39:00.494 --> 03:39:01.594]  Yeah, you don't want to block streets.
[03:39:01.594 --> 03:39:08.338]  If you want to have 100,000 people out and take over a major street, you have to, just because it would shut everything down.
[03:39:08.338 --> 03:39:09.619]  Well, I'll put it this way.
[03:39:09.619 --> 03:39:12.261]  I remember when I did the plan for the Democratic National Convention.
[03:39:12.961 --> 03:39:13.402]  Wow.
[03:39:13.402 --> 03:39:22.911]  In L.A., back in 2000 when I was with the California Patrol, and I remember meeting with Senator Tom, what's his name?
[03:39:22.911 --> 03:39:23.712]  Daschle.
[03:39:23.712 --> 03:39:24.412]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:39:24.412 --> 03:39:27.956]  State Senator, who used to be married to Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden.
[03:39:28.942 --> 03:39:32.484]  And he started to ask me, hey, what are you going to do when the naked lesbians get up on the freeway?
[03:39:32.484 --> 03:39:46.513]  I said, look, I'm hoping that you as a responsible leader will not have folks come up on our freeway and block lanes because I'd be concerned about people becoming angry and getting out of their cars and starting to beat on the protesters for their own safety.
[03:39:46.513 --> 03:39:51.557]  So I think that we have our special response unit that handles crowd control.
[03:39:52.277 --> 03:39:55.100]  Their organizational model is protect the first.
[03:39:55.100 --> 03:40:00.144]  Protect people's first right amendments to rights to
[03:40:02.048 --> 03:40:06.769]  But then there is the public safety issue.
[03:40:06.769 --> 03:40:10.029]  The biggest problem is not people are being loud.
[03:40:10.029 --> 03:40:19.731]  It's peaceful protesters that get infiltrated by a handful of, you know, anarchist type that next thing you know they're hurling, they get in the middle of a peaceful crowd and they start throwing rocks and bottles.
[03:40:19.731 --> 03:40:24.992]  Oh, did you hear about Denver where the police in the Denver Post got caught attacking their own police in a staged event?
[03:40:24.992 --> 03:40:25.232]  No.
[03:40:25.232 --> 03:40:26.132]  Six months ago?
[03:40:26.132 --> 03:40:26.793]  Don't know anything about it.
[03:40:29.697 --> 03:40:32.318]  I'm going to put up on screen for everybody right now.
[03:40:32.318 --> 03:40:33.118]  Guys, Google this.
[03:40:33.118 --> 03:40:37.199]  I'm going to get the exact headline.
[03:40:37.199 --> 03:40:45.662]  ACL looks at police attacking police in Denver.
[03:40:45.662 --> 03:40:48.523]  Police attack police in Denver, dressed up like anarchists.
[03:40:48.523 --> 03:40:53.264]  For the news cameras to then demonize them, and the other cops didn't even know that these were police attacking them.
[03:40:53.735 --> 03:40:55.961]  Well, I'd have a problem if that was the case.
[03:40:55.961 --> 03:40:57.825]  We're not in the business of inciting riots.
[03:40:57.825 --> 03:41:00.733]  But I mean, you're aware in history that police agencies have done that.
[03:41:01.226 --> 03:41:02.907]  Well, I'll put it this way.
[03:41:02.907 --> 03:41:09.953]  I wouldn't be surprised if something like that has happened because in law enforcement there's good and bad in everything and sometimes people become misguided.
[03:41:09.953 --> 03:41:12.875]  That's why it's important to have proper oversight.
[03:41:12.875 --> 03:41:17.299]  You have to make sure we have the appropriate level of supervision and management to ensure that we're doing the right thing.
[03:41:17.299 --> 03:41:23.824]  But who is commanding police in Montreal, Canada, in Denver, in Seattle to do this?
[03:41:24.658 --> 03:41:25.539]  I don't know.
[03:41:25.539 --> 03:41:26.699]  I can't speak for other agencies.
[03:41:26.699 --> 03:41:27.379]  Well, we know who.
[03:41:27.379 --> 03:41:28.500]  Delta Force.
[03:41:28.500 --> 03:41:31.962]  That was in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Seattle Times.
[03:41:31.962 --> 03:41:41.166]  And speaking of that, last time I brought up troops on the streets, you were giggling about it, but I know you're a newshound because you're usually informed of everything I bring up.
[03:41:41.166 --> 03:41:51.771]  Are you aware that the Army War College North Common and others have announced they're going to have 20,000 combat troops to engage the American people and the Army War College says that their new mission will be to suppress civil unrest inside the United States?
[03:41:53.760 --> 03:41:55.527]  I'm not familiar with that now.
[03:41:55.527 --> 03:41:58.741]  Here is the Army Times Exhibit A.
[03:41:59.813 --> 03:42:01.854]  Exhibit A, United States Northern Command, U.S.
[03:42:01.854 --> 03:42:06.418]  Northern Command gains dedicated response force.
[03:42:06.418 --> 03:42:10.841]  And if you read, they say it's for WMDs, but then they add for civil unrest.
[03:42:10.841 --> 03:42:15.564]  Here's NORTHCOM presents Brigade Homelanders Regular Army.
[03:42:15.564 --> 03:42:16.785]  Here's another one.
[03:42:16.785 --> 03:42:19.407]  I believe that's Newsweek.
[03:42:19.407 --> 03:42:21.028]  Here's the Phoenix Business Journal.
[03:42:21.028 --> 03:42:25.151]  Arizona police say they are prepared as War College warns military must prep for unrest.
[03:42:25.151 --> 03:42:26.512]  IMF warns of economic riots.
[03:42:27.648 --> 03:42:45.273]  Yeah, I think that what you're probably talking about is instances where the resources of local, state, and county governments are overwhelmed, that there may be a need at some point to have troops assist in quelling civil unrest.
[03:42:45.273 --> 03:42:47.434]  What I mean by civil unrest, I'm talking about violent
[03:42:49.775 --> 03:42:51.796]  Yeah, I was in L.A.
[03:42:51.796 --> 03:42:57.218]  during the Rodney King riots, and I can tell you that law enforcement response was pretty embarrassing.
[03:42:57.218 --> 03:42:57.798]  Stood down?
[03:42:57.798 --> 03:42:59.579]  Yeah, it was.
[03:42:59.579 --> 03:43:01.119]  Why did that happen?
[03:43:01.119 --> 03:43:02.320]  Lack of leadership.
[03:43:02.320 --> 03:43:10.263]  I was extremely angry, because when you see people starting to burn down, you just roll everybody that's clear.
[03:43:10.263 --> 03:43:11.904]  You just send out an all-point, you know,
[03:43:12.484 --> 03:43:22.688]  I call out for help for everybody, and my philosophy is that you put as many cops there as soon as you can, as soon as people see you making arrests and taking appropriate action, that will have a deterrent effect on anybody else.
[03:43:22.688 --> 03:43:24.169]  If not the hysteria.
[03:43:24.169 --> 03:43:30.492]  It just starts spreading, and so, I mean, we lost 50 American lives, I don't remember the exact number.
[03:43:30.492 --> 03:43:31.492]  You know what turned the tide, though?
[03:43:31.492 --> 03:43:34.933]  A lot of it was the Koreans and others up on top of their businesses.
[03:43:34.933 --> 03:43:38.295]  Well, they had to protect their own businesses in some of the locations.
[03:43:38.820 --> 03:43:51.506]  Yeah, to me that was a very embarrassing situation for me because we should never, as police officers, let it get to a point where we need to have somebody else come in and do our jobs.
[03:43:51.506 --> 03:43:59.090]  We're the peacemakers in this country, we're the peacekeepers in this country, and our job is to not let organizational pride get in the way.
[03:43:59.090 --> 03:44:01.972]  Some departments may be hesitant to call other departments.
[03:44:01.972 --> 03:44:08.495]  I'll be the first to be on the radio asking for help from other agencies here in Central Texas if things start getting out of our hand for us.
[03:44:10.788 --> 03:44:12.009]  Oh, you have the Denver Post.
[03:44:12.009 --> 03:44:14.091]  Put it up on screen, please.
[03:44:14.091 --> 03:44:29.705]  ACLU wants probe into police staged DCN protest, DNC protest, and it says right there, police, undercover police attacked other police, pretended to be violent, inflamed other protesters and officers during the most intense night of the four-day event.
[03:44:30.445 --> 03:44:32.045]  So, so we got there.
[03:44:32.045 --> 03:44:33.286]  We're busy getting a rent car.
[03:44:33.286 --> 03:44:34.606]  We're going to drive around in our RV.
[03:44:34.606 --> 03:44:36.066]  We drove there.
[03:44:36.066 --> 03:44:37.126]  And we are changed.
[03:44:37.126 --> 03:44:41.307]  Luke's there and he says, these guys look like cops and they're throwing things at other cops.
[03:44:41.307 --> 03:44:46.128]  And then I watched Fox News and it was, look at the evil anarchist protesters attacking police.
[03:44:46.128 --> 03:44:48.868]  And I said, looks like it's staged, but we don't know.
[03:44:48.868 --> 03:44:50.548]  I wasn't there.
[03:44:50.548 --> 03:44:52.489]  And then it turns out it was.
[03:44:52.489 --> 03:44:52.849]  Yeah.
[03:44:52.849 --> 03:44:57.930]  Well, if it turns out that it was, I can tell you one thing that won't happen here as long as I'm a police chief, I won't tolerate.
[03:44:57.930 --> 03:44:58.470]  Well, I mean, it was.
[03:44:58.470 --> 03:44:59.470]  I mean, the police admitted it.
[03:45:00.430 --> 03:45:01.171]  Is that what that said?
[03:45:01.171 --> 03:45:02.211]  I didn't see it.
[03:45:02.211 --> 03:45:05.313]  Throw it back up on screen for him.
[03:45:05.313 --> 03:45:07.074]  Denver Post, right there.
[03:45:07.074 --> 03:45:09.016]  That's what I love about this new TV thing we're doing.
[03:45:09.016 --> 03:45:11.037]  We can just put everything up.
[03:45:11.037 --> 03:45:12.918]  And see, this is what happened to me.
[03:45:12.918 --> 03:45:20.183]  I got on talk radio, AXS TV in 95, and I was covering the Federal Reserve, but I was more like a Ron Paul guy, more mainstream version.
[03:45:21.664 --> 03:45:27.511]  People started calling me going, there were black helicopters south of Houston, they blew up a building.
[03:45:27.511 --> 03:45:29.113]  And I would laugh at them.
[03:45:29.113 --> 03:45:37.163]  And then I started seeing in other parts of Texas, and I found out Delta Force would covertly lease a building, buy a nursing home in the middle of town, and then blow it up.
[03:45:37.783 --> 03:45:44.289]  I mean, I ended up going to these events, and buildings are on fire, and there's cribs running around, and police are coming up saying, turn your cameras off.
[03:45:44.289 --> 03:45:45.871]  And then you find out it was an urban warfare drill.
[03:45:45.871 --> 03:45:49.534]  Then the San Antonio police chief, Ali Philippus, refused to be paid off.
[03:45:49.534 --> 03:45:50.715]  They brought bags of cash in.
[03:45:50.715 --> 03:45:52.257]  I mean, I went to his office.
[03:45:52.257 --> 03:45:53.959]  I had an interview with the police chief.
[03:45:53.959 --> 03:45:57.102]  And he said that when I said no, they went and bribed other city officials.
[03:45:57.662 --> 03:46:07.985]  To do an urban warfare drill, which I had the Rand Corporation documents that it was to condition the public for future martial law and acclimate the police and governors to accept this.
[03:46:07.985 --> 03:46:11.486]  Now, then I said, okay, this black helicopter stuff's all real.
[03:46:11.486 --> 03:46:14.848]  I'm going to start going to these public drills with Marines.
[03:46:14.848 --> 03:46:15.748]  So I went to Oakland
[03:46:16.388 --> 03:46:19.450]  And we got Hebron, Maryland, and we'd have police walk over with Marines.
[03:46:19.450 --> 03:46:22.131]  They'd turn their cameras off, and we'd sneak around the bushes and get it.
[03:46:22.131 --> 03:46:25.013]  And they'd have role players screaming, I'm an American, not the camp!
[03:46:25.013 --> 03:46:26.814]  And the Marines would say, get ready for an execution.
[03:46:26.814 --> 03:46:30.436]  They'd put Americans down on their knees, and they'd practice shooting us in the back of the head.
[03:46:30.436 --> 03:46:31.297]  It's all on video, sir!
[03:46:31.897 --> 03:46:32.177]  Okay.
[03:46:32.177 --> 03:46:34.720]  I can give you all these, I'm telling you, just like I showed you the Denver Post.
[03:46:34.720 --> 03:46:34.921]  Yeah.
[03:46:34.921 --> 03:46:37.043]  And I went on the air and I totally changed in 1998.
[03:46:37.043 --> 03:46:40.046]  I said, ladies and gentlemen, this is insane.
[03:46:40.046 --> 03:46:46.754]  And because they know most of the police chiefs are nice, most of the public are nice, they're going to incrementally give us excuses, incrementally.
[03:46:46.754 --> 03:46:47.876]  And see now?
[03:46:47.876 --> 03:46:50.338]  Oh, we got to have them for civil unrest, the Army.
[03:46:50.338 --> 03:46:50.559]  Yeah.
[03:46:51.039 --> 03:46:53.360]  Regular army deployed in America.
[03:46:53.360 --> 03:46:55.860]  See, that's my awakening.
[03:46:55.860 --> 03:46:56.621]  This is real.
[03:46:56.621 --> 03:46:57.961]  This stuff's real.
[03:46:57.961 --> 03:47:02.723]  People can differ on my interpretation, but I've witnessed Marines training to take our guns.
[03:47:02.723 --> 03:47:05.583]  With people saying, I'm an American, please don't knock the camp.
[03:47:05.583 --> 03:47:10.405]  And then when CNN reported, Marines are training in Oakland today to go to Bosnia.
[03:47:11.363 --> 03:47:12.604]  It wasn't Bosnia.
[03:47:12.604 --> 03:47:14.084]  They were trading for America.
[03:47:14.084 --> 03:47:15.285]  And I was there.
[03:47:15.285 --> 03:47:18.366]  And we climbed through fences and we climbed around on our bellies.
[03:47:18.366 --> 03:47:22.287]  I've had troops before to confiscate footage from us.
[03:47:22.287 --> 03:47:28.170]  In San Antonio, walk up and stick a 45 to our chest, grab my camera guy, slam him down and take our camera and say, you're lucky.
[03:47:29.349 --> 03:47:31.030]  Well, like I said, I can't speak to that.
[03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:32.412]  That ended up being in the newspaper.
[03:47:32.412 --> 03:47:35.014]  That's not happening here in Austin.
[03:47:35.014 --> 03:47:40.419]  I'm the police chief in Austin, Texas, and my responsibility is to the people of Austin.
[03:47:40.419 --> 03:47:55.872]  We believe that we have the resources to handle our own issues, and we have plenty of allied agencies near us that can help us, and I hope that we never get to the point where we have to turn over our own public safety to some other agency or some other entity.
[03:47:56.092 --> 03:48:09.555]  Well, I want to say this, as things break down and we go into this controlled depression, I've been called a wimp by some people who always call for violence, but they never do it themselves, for not saying go out and riot and go out and blast and go out and burn.
[03:48:09.555 --> 03:48:15.917]  So on record, I am non-violent, unless it means somebody's taking me and my children and putting us on army trucks, which they're trained for.
[03:48:15.917 --> 03:48:17.297]  Houston Chronicle, they build FEMA camps.
[03:48:17.857 --> 03:48:21.499]  So up to that point, I'm not going to a Mao Zedong re-education center.
[03:48:21.499 --> 03:48:31.084]  But to that point, I'm telling folks, the enemy is not the police and the ground troop military, and it's only going to help the global architects bring in a new world order if we get to that point.
[03:48:31.084 --> 03:48:43.111]  So that's why I want to have this, you know, this Congress we're having, because if we don't, I mean, this is very real, and you're going to see it unfold, Chief.
[03:48:43.111 --> 03:48:43.511]  Just watch.
[03:48:43.931 --> 03:48:59.104]  Well, I think the important thing in a democracy is that we have to be informed, we have to be engaged, and you know, I always tell people, you can sit back and, the reason I'm a police chief is I didn't like some of the things that I'd see growing up when I was a police officer.
[03:48:59.104 --> 03:49:04.348]  You can either spend 30 years in a career complaining about things, or you can position yourself to be a change agent.
[03:49:05.028 --> 03:49:09.732]  And I've always chosen to try to increase my sphere of influence so I can make a difference.
[03:49:09.732 --> 03:49:14.736]  So I think that the population, and your listeners, that violence is never the answer.
[03:49:14.736 --> 03:49:19.439]  Violence should be the last resort in any situation.
[03:49:19.439 --> 03:49:22.142]  It should only be in a life or death situation.
[03:49:22.142 --> 03:49:23.443]  You've got to engage your government.
[03:49:23.443 --> 03:49:24.724]  You've got to question your government.
[03:49:24.724 --> 03:49:34.231]  And, you know, sometimes maybe you need to run for office and be part of the decision makers so you can weigh in on which direction you want your government to go in.
[03:49:34.707 --> 03:49:37.611]  Well, we need good people to do that.
[03:49:37.611 --> 03:49:40.174]  Where did you learn the term change agent?
[03:49:40.174 --> 03:49:51.969]  I don't know where I learned it, but I consider myself a change agent, and I really believe that in my career, I'm really proud of the fact that wherever I've been, I've felt that I've been an agent for positive change.
[03:49:51.969 --> 03:49:53.591]  And positive change in a nutshell is?
[03:49:54.862 --> 03:50:12.299]  Making sure that we're doing the right things for the right reasons, that we treat people with respect, that we respect the rights of our individuals, and more importantly, from a police perspective, that we always police in a manner that's consistent with the constitutional requirements and with the law of the land.
[03:50:13.513 --> 03:50:17.854]  Well, Chief, I notice your crew is out there standing at the door, but you've agreed to stay to the final segment.
[03:50:17.854 --> 03:50:19.214]  You can stay another eight minutes, can't you?
[03:50:19.214 --> 03:50:19.794]  Sure.
[03:50:19.794 --> 03:50:20.794]  We've got to take a quick break.
[03:50:20.794 --> 03:50:21.875]  Are they yelling at me yet?
[03:50:21.875 --> 03:50:22.455]  No, no, they're not.
[03:50:22.455 --> 03:50:25.775]  We're going to come back in a... they're just moving closer to the door.
[03:50:25.775 --> 03:50:27.776]  Your bodyguards are in attack stance out there.
[03:50:27.776 --> 03:50:28.616]  That's not a bodyguard.
[03:50:28.616 --> 03:50:29.656]  You're going to think I'm a bodyguard.
[03:50:29.656 --> 03:50:30.196]  I'm joking.
[03:50:30.196 --> 03:50:31.076]  He's leaning back.
[03:50:31.076 --> 03:50:32.157]  Who is this nice fella?
[03:50:32.157 --> 03:50:33.597]  That's my general support officer.
[03:50:33.597 --> 03:50:37.658]  He's Dennis Ferris, and sometimes he's with me, sometimes he's not.
[03:50:37.658 --> 03:50:38.878]  Depends on how busy my schedule is.
[03:50:39.827 --> 03:50:43.729]  He was telling me about how good your wiretaps are, that they're better than the FBI.
[03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:44.710]  Yeah, did he?
[03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.910]  Yeah.
[03:50:44.910 --> 03:50:46.991]  Okay, Ferris, you're to be seen, not heard.
[03:50:46.991 --> 03:50:47.751]  We've talked about that.
[03:50:49.448 --> 03:50:53.430]  Uh oh, now Ferris is going to tell all the commanders to get Jones.
[03:50:53.430 --> 03:50:54.290]  Get Jones!
[03:50:54.290 --> 03:51:00.913]  Alright, we're going to give out the Austin Police Department website and talk more about that in the final segment with the Police Chief Art Acevedo.
[03:51:00.913 --> 03:51:01.833]  It's been great having him.
[03:51:01.833 --> 03:51:07.676]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[03:51:07.676 --> 03:51:12.738]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:51:13.098 --> 03:51:18.460]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:51:18.460 --> 03:51:24.381]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[03:51:24.381 --> 03:51:30.603]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[03:51:30.603 --> 03:51:34.104]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:51:34.384 --> 03:51:39.207]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:51:39.207 --> 03:51:40.248]  Do your part.

[03:52:04.253 --> 03:52:05.813]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:52:05.813 --> 03:52:07.975]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:52:07.975 --> 03:52:09.876]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[03:52:09.876 --> 03:52:11.356]  The late, great USA.
[03:52:11.356 --> 03:52:13.117]  America, freedom to fascism.

[03:53:46.809 --> 03:53:47.710]  I think so.
[03:54:04.924 --> 03:54:07.745]  I want to thank... No, she doesn't want to be plugged.
[03:54:07.745 --> 03:54:10.186]  If I do, she won't let me get through to you again to set you up.
[03:54:10.186 --> 03:54:10.766]  I'm not going to do it.
[03:54:10.766 --> 03:54:12.427]  No, but you know how to get a hold of me.
[03:54:12.427 --> 03:54:13.467]  I gave you my cell phone.
[03:54:13.467 --> 03:54:14.047]  Yes.
[03:54:14.047 --> 03:54:15.328]  You can do it.
[03:54:15.328 --> 03:54:16.728]  You're really working on me.
[03:54:16.728 --> 03:54:18.949]  You said we're going to go eat Mexican food because you live in the same neighborhood.
[03:54:18.949 --> 03:54:21.129]  Yeah, Mexican food sounds good.
[03:54:21.129 --> 03:54:22.130]  That's all I basically eat.
[03:54:22.130 --> 03:54:24.110]  That's why I got this figure.
[03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:25.191]  Anyway... Yeah, let me know.
[03:54:26.132 --> 03:54:31.175]  Okay, listen, I'm going to plug this sponsor chief and give you the floor at the end because we appreciate you coming in here.
[03:54:31.175 --> 03:54:33.036]  You think you're going to turn us, we're going to turn you.
[03:54:33.036 --> 03:54:37.098]  You're going to end up being a rebel leader against the New World Order.
[03:54:37.098 --> 03:54:41.900]  Seriously, folks, MySolarBackup.com, 877-327-0365.
[03:54:41.900 --> 03:54:50.684]  This is a great little unit, the best sponsor we could find out there because we love to find high quality products.
[03:54:50.684 --> 03:54:51.025]  It's 1800 watt,
[03:54:52.185 --> 03:54:53.146]  Power System.
[03:54:53.146 --> 03:55:00.331]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of power source 1800, power plant and high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:55:00.331 --> 03:55:02.653]  That's right, it generates free electricity.
[03:55:02.653 --> 03:55:09.438]  Once you've purchased it, MySolarBackup.com, the system that stores the power, the solar panels, the controller, everything.
[03:55:09.438 --> 03:55:10.539]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:55:10.539 --> 03:55:11.620]  If their lines are busy, keep trying.
[03:55:11.620 --> 03:55:11.680]  877-327-0365.
[03:55:11.680 --> 03:55:12.620]  And also, another fabulous sponsor,
[03:55:21.587 --> 03:55:24.529]  And that is Ecolablue, the atmospheric water generator.
[03:55:24.529 --> 03:55:25.910]  We got it right here in the office.
[03:55:25.910 --> 03:55:32.395]  It grabs water out of the atmosphere upwards of seven and a half gallons a day, three and a half in some of the drier clines.
[03:55:32.395 --> 03:55:35.897]  Here in Austin, it's more than seven, it's so humid.
[03:55:35.897 --> 03:55:40.760]  Ecolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, again, has made this show possible today.
[03:55:40.760 --> 03:55:44.623]  Atmospheric water generator for the home, pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[03:55:44.623 --> 03:55:47.785]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride and limited water from the humidity in the air.
[03:55:48.826 --> 03:55:51.769]  And great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:55:51.769 --> 03:55:56.112]  Then it goes through seven filters after it's grabbed out of the atmosphere.
[03:55:56.112 --> 03:56:00.696]  Find out more at acolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[03:56:00.696 --> 03:56:03.258]  Chief, I've thrown out a lot of questions at you.
[03:56:03.258 --> 03:56:04.159]  I appreciate you coming in.
[03:56:04.159 --> 03:56:05.900]  My last question is this.
[03:56:05.900 --> 03:56:08.102]  I know it's your job to enforce the law.
[03:56:08.542 --> 03:56:15.445]  State of Texas has ruled, the state court has ruled that the company with the red light cameras in Austin and Texas wide is illegal.
[03:56:15.445 --> 03:56:21.108]  They don't have the license to have it, the private investigator license to be able to gather data.
[03:56:21.108 --> 03:56:25.170]  There's no police officer and jurisprudence involved to write the ticket to make the call.
[03:56:25.170 --> 03:56:26.890]  Same reason they were thrown out in San Diego.
[03:56:26.890 --> 03:56:28.071]  Actually, we write the tickets here.
[03:56:28.331 --> 03:56:32.614]  Yeah, well, it's still here, and the news is saying, and the state's saying it's illegal.
[03:56:32.614 --> 03:56:34.775]  Why is Austin saying they don't care and they're keeping them in?
[03:56:34.775 --> 03:56:41.219]  You know, I think that's, first of all, police officers here review every one of those violations, and we're the ones that issue the citations.
[03:56:41.219 --> 03:56:44.161]  We do not leave that to the... Why does the state court say it's not right?
[03:56:44.701 --> 03:56:53.008]  I think it was a local court, municipal court in Dallas and it's under review and I think the city's, I'm not a lawyer, so the city's position is a little different than that.
[03:56:53.008 --> 03:57:05.538]  But I will tell you this, one of the things that I think is important is that when we put those red light cameras, they have to be, we have to position them based on crash data and not on violation data because it should be about safety and not revenue.
[03:57:06.659 --> 03:57:13.665]  So, I can't speak to the legal aspect of that because I'm not a lawyer, but I'm aware of what you're talking about.
[03:57:13.665 --> 03:57:15.227]  So that's the city and the city attorneys?
[03:57:15.227 --> 03:57:15.827]  That's their issue?
[03:57:15.827 --> 03:57:17.209]  That's the city attorney, yes sir.
[03:57:17.209 --> 03:57:24.416]  But I will tell you that we, police officers, not the vendor, review the violations and we're the ones that issue it to make sure that they're being issued right.
[03:57:24.707 --> 03:57:30.532]  How do folks find out more about your particular office as the Austin Police Chief or check out some of the programs you've got going?
[03:57:30.532 --> 03:57:38.840]  They can go to our website, www.ci.austin.tx.us backslash police.
[03:57:38.840 --> 03:57:46.787]  One thing I do want to say again is that I know that some of your listeners are really worried about my DWI blood draw and search warrant issues.
[03:57:46.787 --> 03:57:49.390]  If they have questions, tell them to just email me or call me.
[03:57:50.631 --> 03:57:54.433]  I'll be more than happy to discuss it with them because at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is save lives.
[03:57:54.433 --> 03:57:56.174]  What's your email, sir?
[03:57:56.174 --> 03:57:58.876]  It's Art.Acevedo at C.I.
[03:57:58.876 --> 03:57:59.676]  I don't know if I should do this.
[03:57:59.676 --> 03:58:01.397]  I'm one of the millions of them.
[03:58:01.397 --> 03:58:01.878]  What is it?
[03:58:01.878 --> 03:58:04.319]  Art.Acevedo at C.I.
[03:58:04.319 --> 03:58:10.703]  All they've got to do is Google Austin Police Department website and the chief's office and it's all right there.
[03:58:10.703 --> 03:58:15.786]  And I know my wife's listening online so I wanted to say hi to my beautiful wife, Tanya.
[03:58:15.786 --> 03:58:17.047]  I miss you and I'll see you later on tonight.
[03:58:17.734 --> 03:58:18.374]  All right.
[03:58:18.374 --> 03:58:21.015]  I've got to have you in the Sunday Show, but it's on 590.
[03:58:21.015 --> 03:58:23.775]  But we are on 1300 here in Austin and 90.1.
[03:58:23.775 --> 03:58:25.535]  Police Chief, thank you for coming in.
[03:58:25.535 --> 03:58:26.256]  And it's good.
[03:58:26.256 --> 03:58:28.896]  Just please, again, I'm not doing anything wrong.
[03:58:28.896 --> 03:58:31.256]  Please don't send the SWAT teams.
[03:58:31.256 --> 03:58:31.757]  No more smoking.
[03:58:31.757 --> 03:58:33.957]  Uh-oh, he just outed me.
[03:58:33.957 --> 03:58:34.057]  Bye.
[03:58:34.057 --> 03:58:35.217]  All right, take care.
[03:58:35.217 --> 03:58:36.337]  There he goes.
[03:58:36.337 --> 03:58:37.698]  Police Chief Art Acevedo.
[03:58:37.698 --> 03:58:39.538]  Retransmission with all the important guests.

[03:59:04.174 --> 03:59:08.879]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:09.099 --> 03:59:10.219]  If you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.219 --> 03:59:13.481]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
