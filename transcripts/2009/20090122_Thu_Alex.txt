[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:06.193]  Adverse reactions to them, headache, fatigue, the chronic pain that I felt.
[00:00:07.294 --> 00:00:12.477]  Magda says she's heard it all before, the doubts, questioning whether they're really sick.
[00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:14.419]  Well, there's definitely something there.
[00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:25.266]  I mean, one of the ways that you can determine whether or not you're sensitive to the light bulbs is if you have them in your home, simply turn them off for a few days and find out if any of your symptoms disappear, the symptoms that you're concerned about.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.281]  Okay, let's review.
[00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:31.085]  UV, headaches, skin problems, and of course, mercury.
[00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.608]  So the old light bulbs are being banned in 2012.
[00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:36.931]  Manufacturers are scrambling to create new ones.
[00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:39.474]  The best choice for the future may be these.
[00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:42.197]  LEDs, light-emitting diodes.
[00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:48.713]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.415]  We're about to go to break here in a moment.
[00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:54.538]  Joe Rogan, my good buddy, visiting here in Austin, is busy beating up the microphone right now.
[00:00:54.558 --> 00:00:56.820]  We're going to talk about a lot of stuff in the next hour and ten minutes.
[00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:57.621]  Joe, good to have you here.
[00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:58.282]  Good to be here.
[00:00:58.542 --> 00:00:58.982]  Thanks, buddy.
[00:00:59.183 --> 00:00:59.643]  What's going on?
[00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:03.086]  I like how we just shook hands, even though we've already shook hands and hugged.
[00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:04.748]  We've got to shake hands for you guys.
[00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:05.648]  Exactly.
[00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.369]  Very important.
[00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.151]  Are you saying it's bad we did that?
[00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:09.492]  No, I'm not saying it's bad.
[00:01:09.532 --> 00:01:10.713]  Keep it real, Jones!
[00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.234]  Keep it real, Alex Jones!
[00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:15.435]  One day closer to victory!
[00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:17.915]  You know, Joe just can't believe I actually really like this.
[00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:18.615]  This is what I'm really like.
[00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:19.816]  Oh, I know, I believe you like this.
[00:01:19.856 --> 00:01:21.056]  I've known you for a long time now, Matt.
[00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:25.437]  You know, I was thinking, we met in 99, so this is actually 10 years.
[00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:30.418]  You remember when I did my DVD that I filmed in Austin, The Belly of the Beast?
[00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:34.679]  You and I wore George W. Bush masks and Herbert Walker Bush masks.
[00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:37.740]  We had a little satanic dance to show that we were satanic.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.041]  We went running around the grounds of the state capitol building
[00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.642]  People thought we were nuts because we were.
[00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:44.662]  You know what was funny?
[00:01:45.022 --> 00:02:04.271]  That was put out on a DVD, I did it, and people found it and said, we found secret video of Alex and Joe, I'm not kidding, of Alex and Joe Rogan doing a satanic ceremony, and we're like, this is a spoof on them, on the Bushes, this is a public DVD sold in stores, but that's how the fake conspiracy theorists that discredit me, that's how they operate.
[00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:11.654]  How many fake conspiracy theorists do you believe are actually employed by the government to make conspiracy theorists look ridiculous?
[00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:18.396]  Like, when you read about a guy like William Cooper, like some of the stuff that he said, like, about, like, he thought that Kennedy's driver shot Kennedy.
[00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:19.156]  Well, it wasn't true.
[00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:20.196]  It was ridiculous!
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:23.617]  But it's, like, so crazy that everything else he says, you gotta go, what?
[00:02:23.837 --> 00:02:28.658]  Well, I don't think he was an operative, but what I think is, I mean, he's better compared to some.
[00:02:28.778 --> 00:02:29.679]  I mean, I have documents.
[00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.159]  I go off...
[00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.560]  99% of the time, I'm not even speculating.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.484]  I'm going to make an Alex Jones t-shirt, and it's going to say underneath it, I have documents.
[00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:40.046]  Whenever there's anything crazy.
[00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:41.868]  I have documents, ladies and gentlemen, I can show you right now.
[00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:43.289]  Let me ask you a question, though.
[00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.355]  There are a few hundred cases going back into the 60s, especially with COINTELPRO, where they would have activists act crazy, say crazy things.
[00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:51.216]  Of course, right?
[00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:52.858]  I mean, it's an effective way to do it.
[00:02:52.878 --> 00:03:01.388]  I mean, if you look at, like, the way arguments progress on message boards, as soon as someone believes anything wacky... Well, now CENTCOM, now the military admits that they are on the web.
[00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:01.968]  Yeah, I read that.
[00:03:02.068 --> 00:03:02.909]  I read that recently.
[00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:03.430]  It's fascinating.
[00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.331]  You have the documents.
[00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:05.592]  I have the documents.
[00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:06.614]  Well, you do, see?
[00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:10.495]  But it's fascinating how they have, like, directions on how to troll.
[00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:16.397]  How to troll people, how to bait them in arguments, how to respond when you're being, you know, antagonized.
[00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:17.017]  Yeah, that's all come out.
[00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:17.717]  That's all come out.
[00:03:17.757 --> 00:03:18.338]  It's fascinating.
[00:03:18.358 --> 00:03:20.758]  So, so, so we know that there, hundreds have been caught.
[00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:22.459]  We know CENTCOM's hired tens of thousands.
[00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.540]  And they even have private PR firms that do it.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.120]  And so, yes, it is there.
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.882]  But, but more often than not, I'm sad to say, the crazies, it's just schizophrenics and people too.
[00:03:30.902 --> 00:03:32.282]  I mean, there are outright nuts.
[00:03:32.322 --> 00:03:32.682]  Stay there.
[00:03:32.942 --> 00:03:33.902]  Joe Rogan in studio.
[00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.203]  Ladies and gentlemen, the info war continues.
[00:03:35.623 --> 00:03:39.545]  A new phase of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:47.068]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:03:47.308 --> 00:03:48.708]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:52.830]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.671]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:03:56.911 --> 00:04:01.013]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:04:01.393 --> 00:04:03.214]  Phase One is a One World Currency.
[00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:05.377]  Which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:04:05.397 --> 00:04:07.360]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.123]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[00:04:14.503 --> 00:04:18.046]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com.

[00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:27.673]  Go to foodshortageusa.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:04:27.713 --> 00:04:27.973]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:04:34.898 --> 00:04:36.940]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.462]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:04:39.482 --> 00:04:42.084]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:04:42.104 --> 00:04:43.285]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:44.926]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:47.848]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:04:47.908 --> 00:04:51.551]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:06.019]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.931]  How dare you?
[00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:17.353]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:05:17.373 --> 00:05:19.774]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:26.457]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:05:26.477 --> 00:05:29.318]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:31.559]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.300]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:05:35.177 --> 00:05:35.717]  You worry.
[00:05:36.077 --> 00:05:37.798]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:05:38.158 --> 00:05:40.379]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.601]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:05:42.921 --> 00:05:44.121]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:47.723]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:52.985]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:56.687]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:05:57.327 --> 00:05:58.668]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:01.629]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.871]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:13.543]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:06:14.003 --> 00:06:18.405]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:28.229]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:29.970]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:43.209]  All right, this hour and five minutes we've got left with Joe is just going to go by so quickly.
[00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.010]  So let's go ahead and get into it.
[00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.033]  During the breaks, we're having even more interesting discussions than we're having on air.
[00:06:48.593 --> 00:06:51.755]  You were asking me, what's this Ron Paul clip I've got on the screen over here?
[00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:55.298]  And I was saying, I played it earlier, where suddenly Glenn Beck comes out and goes, the world government's real.
[00:06:55.318 --> 00:06:56.719]  The international bankers are dangerous.
[00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:58.600]  They're more dangerous than stounding armies.
[00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:00.762]  Thomas Jefferson quotes, what do we do?
[00:07:00.802 --> 00:07:02.303]  They're bankrupting us by design.
[00:07:02.924 --> 00:07:06.126]  But now he's doing it on Fox News, so that's going to discredit that message.
[00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:08.688]  But you were bringing up Ron Paul and his ideas.
[00:07:09.168 --> 00:07:10.949]  Why do you think that it discredits that message?
[00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:15.593]  I mean, if he's saying it on Fox News, maybe they're saying it because they're really worried about it now.
[00:07:15.873 --> 00:07:24.298]  Maybe it's gotten to the point where even the people that were supposedly supporting a corrupt administration are now scared that it's far more corrupt than they had ever believed.
[00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:25.039]  Well, let's hope so!
[00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:36.389]  That's what I, when I see a guy like Glenn Beck, I think, here's a guy who wants attention, he wants to be a smart guy, he wants to be sensible, he wants to prove a point, but I feel like a lot of it's like an act.
[00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:44.015]  I feel like he's this American apple pie guy, and now I heard that he's doing some sort of a performance, where he's like, he has a live show.
[00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:46.137]  And I'm like, okay, he's like an entertainer.
[00:07:46.157 --> 00:07:51.181]  Well, a year ago he said, the army needs to watch and look at and be used against Ron Paul supporters.
[00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:52.342]  But you see what I'm saying about his opinions?
[00:07:52.362 --> 00:07:54.884]  I mean, if he wants to do a live show, he's an entertainer.
[00:07:55.304 --> 00:07:58.987]  You know, I mean, that's really, I mean, no news person does a live show.
[00:07:59.227 --> 00:08:00.268]  They don't even think about that.
[00:08:00.288 --> 00:08:02.549]  So what validates his opinions?
[00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:08.134]  You know, maybe he is a guy that was on the side of it because he thought that it was the right thing to do.
[00:08:08.214 --> 00:08:13.958]  Or maybe he's mixing in real issues, but then sandwiching it with more government propaganda, which he's doing.
[00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:14.839]  That could be.
[00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:21.864]  I mean, it could be that he's, you know, this is the new stance, that this is the new stance at Fox News, is they always need an army, or they always need an enemy.
[00:08:22.124 --> 00:08:30.010]  And so now, if the enemy isn't the liberals, maybe if the liberals are in charge and they've decided to work with them, now, you know, the idea is that we're supposed to be afraid of the international banks.
[00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.432]  But it is the international banks that orchestrated the collapse.
[00:08:33.132 --> 00:08:34.894]  I have the documents, as they say.
[00:08:35.154 --> 00:08:52.193]  Do you believe that it was orchestrated, or do you believe that it was orchestrated and fell apart because of just human nature and greed and the fact that these people were willing to take these crazy loans that they couldn't pay off, and houses that they couldn't afford, and that bankers knew that these houses were just never going to continue to appreciate.
[00:08:52.213 --> 00:08:53.654]  They were completely overinflated.
[00:08:53.674 --> 00:08:55.096]  Do you think it's a little bit of both, maybe?
[00:08:55.476 --> 00:09:04.419]  It is a little bit of both, because in the lending changes they made in the mid and late 90s, that allowed sub-brokerage in banks to run scams, and that did happen.
[00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:22.065]  But the large central banks, we have their own policy papers, and when I went and infiltrated Bilderberg three years ago, and it's in my film, Endgame, out for a year and a half, I said they're going to pop the subprime mortgage, create an international banking crisis, and then propose a world bank that you'll pay carbon taxes to, and that was now in Newsweek two weeks ago.
[00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:24.667]  If that happens, what happens to all the money in America?
[00:09:24.707 --> 00:09:25.808]  What's the thought behind that?
[00:09:25.868 --> 00:09:29.671]  Like everybody who has a million dollars all of a sudden has a zero and we all start at scratch?
[00:09:30.072 --> 00:09:37.658]  Well the elite have transferred the assets while they still have value into tangible hard resources and infrastructure.
[00:09:37.818 --> 00:09:39.079]  Like oil and stuff like that.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.481]  So is that the thought behind it?
[00:09:41.762 --> 00:09:43.423]  That they're just going to cancel out all the money?
[00:09:43.463 --> 00:09:45.245]  That they're going to completely implode the dollar?
[00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:54.995]  What they're going to do is have a world banking system, it's already there, but go public, that will set the currency values and that will control the major western governments.
[00:09:55.015 --> 00:09:58.598]  So you'll already have a world currency, but you'll still have your local unit.
[00:09:58.838 --> 00:10:03.302]  Kind of like Sports Illustrated is in 15 different regions or whatever, but it's still Sports Illustrated.
[00:10:03.783 --> 00:10:12.971]  So you'll still have a dollar, you'll still have a peso, you'll still have a pound, you'll still have a euro, but it's all going to be devalued simultaneously.
[00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:14.632]  No, okay, here's the question.
[00:10:14.832 --> 00:10:21.398]  Is there a way to stop anything like, if this is all real, if this is really what's going to happen, is there a way to stop it, or at this point in time, should it be stopped?
[00:10:21.458 --> 00:10:22.779]  I mean, what do you think should happen?
[00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:24.940]  Oh, it's probably going to fail.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.884]  Even the bankers are saying in their own policy reports to the public that this is going to be a hard sell.
[00:10:29.944 --> 00:10:34.108]  So, we're going into one hell of a fight, because these guys won't give us quarter.
[00:10:35.086 --> 00:10:37.009]  I mean, they're not going to stop.
[00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.094]  So the bankers are saying they're not going to be able to pull it off?
[00:10:40.574 --> 00:10:41.977]  They're saying it's very hard for them.
[00:10:42.337 --> 00:10:47.866]  But now, since they built the crisis, and they're saying they have to do it or it will all fall apart.
[00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:54.615]  Is it possible to re... I mean, because of this crisis... I mean, is it possible that they could re-engineer to bring it back to life?
[00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:58.277]  Or is it just... I mean, would it... I don't understand enough about the way the financial system works.
[00:10:58.297 --> 00:11:02.841]  No, but see, that's what's so psycho about these globalists is they've created this crisis.
[00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.982]  We're only going to the next Ponzi scheme.
[00:11:05.022 --> 00:11:06.983]  We'll save it, which then gives them all the power.
[00:11:07.223 --> 00:11:10.165]  So they say to the country, you better go with us or it's over.
[00:11:10.286 --> 00:11:11.446]  And in a way, it's really true.
[00:11:11.767 --> 00:11:13.548]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds with Joe Rogan.
[00:11:17.406 --> 00:11:18.986]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:11:25.128 --> 00:11:25.728]  Hello, friends.
[00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:26.688]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:11:26.828 --> 00:11:31.409]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:11:31.569 --> 00:11:34.330]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.391]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:11:37.571 --> 00:11:42.272]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:11:42.512 --> 00:11:43.452]  If you simply prepare.
[00:11:43.652 --> 00:11:46.553]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:53.776]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:11:53.876 --> 00:11:56.997]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:11:57.157 --> 00:11:57.417]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[00:12:12.325 --> 00:12:13.826]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:14.286]  Take action today.
[00:12:14.306 --> 00:12:16.127]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:12:27.876 --> 00:12:29.780]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:33.046]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:12:37.486 --> 00:12:38.827]  All right, let's move quick, Joe.
[00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:40.488]  There's a lot going on, a lot happening.
[00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:41.889]  Mainstream media.
[00:12:42.589 --> 00:12:44.670]  Government cover-ups.
[00:12:46.171 --> 00:12:46.851]  So does he.
[00:12:47.472 --> 00:12:51.074]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:12:51.654 --> 00:12:54.056]  And now, live from Austin, Texas.
[00:12:54.476 --> 00:12:56.577]  Yeah, it's on PrisonPlanet.tv live.
[00:12:56.617 --> 00:12:57.117]  Here we go.
[00:12:58.058 --> 00:13:00.139]  Yeah, Joe, this is streaming out on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:02.340]  Then it gets ripped all over the four corners of the web.
[00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:05.969]  And it's also been simulcasting on the radio.
[00:13:05.989 --> 00:13:08.050]  You've got a serious setup here, sir.
[00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.751]  No, it's pretty good.
[00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:10.831]  Thank you for liking it, though.
[00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:11.872]  Pretty sporty.
[00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:15.073]  Kubrick films playing in the background.
[00:13:15.093 --> 00:13:17.794]  It's kind of creepy.
[00:13:19.975 --> 00:13:22.256]  Well, the real world is creepy, as you know.
[00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:23.537]  The real world is creepy.
[00:13:25.017 --> 00:13:26.138]  Very, very, very creepy.
[00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:31.123]  Let's get into, first off, before we get into Ron Paul, what's some of the latest stuff you're working on?
[00:13:31.163 --> 00:13:33.945]  I mean, you're the top host, one of the founding hosts.
[00:13:33.965 --> 00:13:40.872]  We'll find out if people ever talk about the host, they'll talk about you, with Ultimate Fighting becoming an international super craze, just getting bigger and bigger.
[00:13:41.072 --> 00:13:42.313]  You've done all these big TV shows.
[00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:43.574]  You're just another big TV show.
[00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:44.595]  You're doing the comedian stuff.
[00:13:44.856 --> 00:13:46.197]  Tell us what Joe Rogan's up to these days.
[00:13:46.277 --> 00:13:49.941]  Well, I mean, primarily my job is always a stand-up comic.
[00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:50.883]  I mean, that's really what I do.
[00:13:50.943 --> 00:13:53.105]  Everything else, you know, I kind of do for money.
[00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:58.732]  The UFC is, you know, my big gig, and that's just an awesome job.
[00:13:58.752 --> 00:13:59.733]  I mean, I just love doing that.
[00:13:59.753 --> 00:14:00.654]  I love doing commentary.
[00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:01.735]  I'm a huge fan of the sport.
[00:14:02.236 --> 00:14:07.160]  And then I do little things on the side sometimes, like I just did this thing for CBS called Game Show in My Head.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.001]  It's like a hidden camera comedy game show.
[00:14:09.261 --> 00:14:12.283]  We did eight of them and they're airing all throughout January.
[00:14:12.303 --> 00:14:13.244]  It's actually pretty funny.
[00:14:13.724 --> 00:14:17.928]  It's a hidden camera comedy game show where they have to do these crazy things.
[00:14:17.948 --> 00:14:21.410]  They have an earpiece in and I'm talking to them and there's hidden cameras everywhere.
[00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:27.835]  So, but I think we did eight of those, so I think it's done at the end of this month.
[00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:29.575]  But I remember you saying that about Fear Factor.
[00:14:29.915 --> 00:14:34.717]  You go, oh, I did this, I don't even really want to do it, I'm just doing a lot of things, I don't think this is going to go.
[00:14:34.737 --> 00:14:37.217]  That's what I thought when I was first doing it.
[00:14:37.237 --> 00:14:38.517]  I was like, this thing's so stupid.
[00:14:38.637 --> 00:14:40.878]  I was just going to last.
[00:14:41.098 --> 00:14:42.778]  It lasted for six years, you know?
[00:14:43.158 --> 00:14:48.900]  I mean, shows like that are, you know, if you have a skill, if you're a good host, if you know how to host those shows, they're fun to do.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:49.660]  They're easy.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.120]  Well, you did MADtv, too.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.000]  No, I didn't.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.101]  I just did a guest appearance on MADtv.
[00:14:54.241 --> 00:14:55.302]  But then also news radio?
[00:14:55.382 --> 00:14:56.243]  Yeah, news radio.
[00:14:56.343 --> 00:14:58.346]  What was your favorite show you've ever done?
[00:14:58.466 --> 00:15:05.334]  News radio was the most fun, creatively, because it was a comedy, it was really fun to do, and it was, you know, really interesting.
[00:15:05.354 --> 00:15:06.495]  It was real acting, I mean, yeah.
[00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:09.158]  Well, I mean, you know, action's not that hard.
[00:15:09.438 --> 00:15:10.279]  Man yourself, yeah.
[00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:12.520]  Especially sitcom acting, you know, it's really easy.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:23.506]  But it was a really unique opportunity to work with a bunch of really talented people like Phil Hartman and Dave Foley and Andy Dick and all the people that were on that show were just really talented, you know, Maura Tierney.
[00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:30.710]  And it's because of that, you know, I got to really appreciate, like, the craft of creating, like, a good television show.
[00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.633]  So it makes it hard to do another one afterwards.
[00:15:32.653 --> 00:15:37.761]  That's why, in a sense, that Fear Factor was a good thing to do, because it was way better to do that than a crappy sitcom.
[00:15:37.781 --> 00:15:41.808]  It's like, let's just do this goofy game show, you know, that's not really supposed to be a comedy.
[00:15:45.074 --> 00:15:47.355]  It never happens unless we have a big guest in studio.
[00:15:47.415 --> 00:15:48.655]  We have multiple backup lines.
[00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:51.476]  Our connection to the satellite just cut out, but we have backups to the satellite.
[00:15:51.896 --> 00:15:52.957]  You have backups to the satellite?
[00:15:53.157 --> 00:15:56.018]  So the connection cut out and you think that it's the government that's doing this?
[00:15:56.118 --> 00:15:56.658]  No, no.
[00:15:56.718 --> 00:15:59.639]  It only happens if I have Ron Paul or Jesse Ventura in studio.
[00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:01.199]  It only happens if Charlie Sheen's on.
[00:16:01.439 --> 00:16:03.020]  We probably have one of those guests every month.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.200]  And it only happens when a big guest is on, generally.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.381]  Well, I'm far less threatening than any of those gentlemen.
[00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:10.962]  We have four backups to the satellite, so we're fine.
[00:16:10.982 --> 00:16:11.943]  You need not worry about me.
[00:16:12.063 --> 00:16:12.723]  I'm a comedian.
[00:16:15.994 --> 00:16:20.655]  Uh, but your real passion is the, uh, the stand-up.
[00:16:21.075 --> 00:16:23.456]  Yeah, stand-up is, uh, well, stand-up is everything.
[00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:25.817]  Stand-up to me is, uh, you know, it's life.
[00:16:25.917 --> 00:16:34.139]  It's like your perception of life, you know, and it's the most fun, it's the most, uh, to do it as an art form, it's the most rewarding.
[00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:35.520]  I mean, you're making people feel better.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:42.001]  You, like, you get in front of a room full of people and you make them, literally, their physical state changes and they have a great time and they enjoy it.
[00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:43.902]  And you're kind of getting high off that energy, aren't you?
[00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:49.366]  Yeah, definitely, and I think it also, not only does it do that, I think it enhances your life.
[00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:53.449]  Because I think, without sounding like, you know, gay and hippie...
[00:16:54.372 --> 00:16:59.794]  Well, you know, what you put out, when you put out positive energy, I think, you know, you get positive energy back.
[00:17:00.134 --> 00:17:00.934]  I think that's real.
[00:17:01.214 --> 00:17:11.238]  And I think that living your life, like, making people laugh and having a good time and doing stand-up comedy and traveling all around the world doing that, it's like you're pumping out a lot of positive energy.
[00:17:11.278 --> 00:17:15.019]  And I think that... Hold on, it sounds like ice cream trucks, as Willie Nelson says.
[00:17:15.979 --> 00:17:16.901]  Hold on, huh?
[00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:18.043]  It's Christmas out there.
[00:17:18.524 --> 00:17:19.165]  Stay there, Joe.
[00:17:19.245 --> 00:17:19.626]  Quick break.
[00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:19.927]  Come back.
[00:17:19.987 --> 00:17:20.708]  Long segment.
[00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:22.191]  Plenty of time.
[00:17:22.672 --> 00:17:24.034]  Plenty of time to get back to the ice cream.
[00:17:24.054 --> 00:17:25.317]  Get closer to victory, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:26.519]  Ice Cream Trucks.
[00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:27.120]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:17:35.382 --> 00:17:39.024]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:44.728]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:17:44.828 --> 00:17:48.870]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.452]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:57.415]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures
[00:17:57.415 --> 00:17:58.056]  We're good to go!
[00:18:14.735 --> 00:18:15.716]  We're good to go.
[00:18:35.266 --> 00:18:36.947]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:18:37.247 --> 00:18:40.668]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:18:40.868 --> 00:18:42.709]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.051]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:51.813]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:18:52.093 --> 00:18:55.995]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:18:56.335 --> 00:19:01.238]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:19:01.518 --> 00:19:04.299]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:11.423]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:17.626]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:19:17.766 --> 00:19:22.288]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[00:19:22.568 --> 00:19:26.311]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.233]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[00:19:28.273 --> 00:19:29.975]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:19:29.995 --> 00:19:30.756]  Everyone needs something
[00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:55.653]  I think so.
[00:20:07.244 --> 00:20:07.604]  We're good to go!
[00:20:36.184 --> 00:20:38.366]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.750]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:46.497]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:20:46.737 --> 00:20:53.322]  We just got confirmation Alex Jones will be with me at one of these shows this weekend, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:53.722 --> 00:20:54.383]  I don't know which one.
[00:20:54.683 --> 00:20:56.545]  But you're not going to embarrass me calling me up there.
[00:20:57.065 --> 00:20:58.666]  Like Doug Stanhope did that crazy night?
[00:20:58.966 --> 00:20:59.647]  I saw that video.
[00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:08.033]  And then some Marines started a fight with me because... You got really into it and I think they were expecting a comedy show and you just started going crazy about the New World Order.
[00:21:09.995 --> 00:21:11.016]  It got a little ugly.
[00:21:11.737 --> 00:21:13.438]  Well, I mean, Doug's like, come up here.
[00:21:13.578 --> 00:21:14.299]  I didn't want to go up.
[00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:15.219]  Doug's like, come up, come up.
[00:21:15.259 --> 00:21:16.520]  I'm like, man, I'm not going to do comedy.
[00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:26.969]  I had to listen to his message three times because he was laughing so hard while he was leaving the message describing you going on stage, what happened, all the chaos that ensued, and how you were up there.
[00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:28.790]  You were on stage for like a while, too, right?
[00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:29.631]  About 20 minutes.
[00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:30.372]  That's right.
[00:21:30.432 --> 00:21:32.513]  You even did the man show with him.
[00:21:32.533 --> 00:21:33.234]  You've done everything.
[00:21:33.274 --> 00:21:35.256]  Yeah, I've done a lot of dumb stuff.
[00:21:36.434 --> 00:21:37.635]  No, you've done well, Lord Vader.
[00:21:37.655 --> 00:21:38.795]  Lord Vader?
[00:21:38.835 --> 00:21:40.196]  Whoa, so I'm the evil guy?
[00:21:43.518 --> 00:21:48.580]  No, but there were some troops in the front row and they didn't like me being anti-war.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.681]  Well, you know what?
[00:21:49.701 --> 00:21:50.881]  Troops never want to hear that.
[00:21:51.562 --> 00:21:56.404]  If they're risking their life going over there, they want to think that it's for a noble and just cause.
[00:21:56.705 --> 00:21:59.266]  In that sense, their actions are heroic.
[00:21:59.286 --> 00:22:01.407]  I just don't want more coffins coming back.
[00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:02.308]  Sure, of course.
[00:22:02.368 --> 00:22:03.749]  And a million and a half dead Iraqis.
[00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.071]  Well, not only that.
[00:22:05.091 --> 00:22:08.294]  I mean, the whole idea of war in this day and age, it's a shell game.
[00:22:08.575 --> 00:22:17.444]  You're taking one leader, a leader of a group of people, and saying that he's going to protect them from another group of people that's wielded by another leader.
[00:22:17.605 --> 00:22:18.245]  And the U.S.
[00:22:18.285 --> 00:22:20.648]  put Saddam in to begin with, told him to invade Kuwait.
[00:22:20.708 --> 00:22:26.652]  Well, I mean, the whole conflict and resolution thing, the way it's set up, it's almost like there has to be war, there has to be problems.
[00:22:26.672 --> 00:22:32.855]  If there isn't, there's no way to keep control of the entire population and keep them from assimilating into one gigantic mass.
[00:22:32.895 --> 00:22:35.177]  I mean, that's really what people are holding back.
[00:22:35.217 --> 00:22:35.677]  That's it.
[00:22:35.697 --> 00:22:36.297]  Divide and conquer.
[00:22:36.317 --> 00:22:43.301]  The ability to communicate with everybody and the ability to think of all of us as just brothers and sisters on this planet, just fellow human beings.
[00:22:43.321 --> 00:22:44.462]  Instead of playing us off against each other.
[00:22:44.462 --> 00:22:44.922]  Exactly.
[00:22:44.942 --> 00:22:48.044]  They're playing us off against each other, just going off our bases fears.
[00:22:48.064 --> 00:22:53.147]  I mean, that's what military and that's what government and leaders have been doing since the beginning of time.
[00:22:53.207 --> 00:22:59.291]  It's just, it shouldn't work the same way now as it did when there was no communication, there was no internet.
[00:22:59.331 --> 00:23:04.534]  It's like, now that we have the ability to spread information so quickly and, you know, in that sense you're helping that along.
[00:23:04.774 --> 00:23:06.155]  You're helping put an end to that.
[00:23:06.435 --> 00:23:10.818]  I mean, and eventually it will be that, you know, you can't trick everybody.
[00:23:11.078 --> 00:23:22.325]  We'll have so much access to information, it'll be impossible to convince someone that there's some people on the other side of the planet that have never seen them, never met them, and that they hate them for their freedom, or some other retarded idea.
[00:23:22.345 --> 00:23:35.394]  Well, Zbigniew Brzezinski, in his grand chessboard book, Obama's Top Advisor 97, said, we built a world government, but we can't get our people to go take over our enemies anymore, because they don't see foreigners as their enemies, so we've got to hype that up in the media.
[00:23:35.434 --> 00:23:37.375]  I mean, they admit all this and write books about it.
[00:23:37.455 --> 00:23:43.763]  The whole idea behind government, the whole idea behind governing human beings has got to change.
[00:23:44.024 --> 00:23:47.889]  What we've got to realize at some point in time is we're evolving.
[00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:52.835]  Human beings are evolving and right now we're in some sort of an adolescent stage of evolution.
[00:23:52.856 --> 00:23:54.698]  I think we're devolving right now.
[00:23:54.798 --> 00:23:57.720]  Well, you know, that's always coming along with it.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.141]  It's because it makes it easier.
[00:23:59.441 --> 00:24:06.945]  Because when you make life easier for people and you don't make them develop discipline and skill, they can just drift through life like a retard.
[00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:08.967]  There's a lot of people that will just do that on instinct.
[00:24:09.007 --> 00:24:10.588]  That's another thing, that's another thing.
[00:24:10.608 --> 00:24:12.168]  I'm talking about you, Joe, while you're here.
[00:24:12.489 --> 00:24:17.952]  You also have been big into martial arts yourself and train with a lot of the people in Ultimate Fighting, don't you?
[00:24:18.092 --> 00:24:31.744]  Well, I do martial arts and I think that for your thinking, just to manage your biology as a man, I think it's very important to have control over your system, over your biological system.
[00:24:32.025 --> 00:24:33.226]  And I think one big
[00:24:34.026 --> 00:24:42.232]  Big effect on a lot of people's life is stress just stress from being stuck in traffic or your bills or not Just male stress just natural.
[00:24:42.252 --> 00:24:47.795]  I mean, we're designed to chase things down and and and beat on animals and stuff I mean, that's what we're here for.
[00:24:47.835 --> 00:25:02.405]  We have a certain amount of energy that we need to expire We need to express we need to pump it out of our body and if we don't do that it's very difficult to manage your emotions manage your thinking to think clearly and calmly and Exercise is the best thing for that
[00:25:03.706 --> 00:25:07.811]  The best tool for just clear thinking and, you know, just objective thinking.
[00:25:08.192 --> 00:25:13.959]  It drains your body of all the unnatural stress and allows you to look at things with a more even keel.
[00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:14.620]  I agree.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.002]  Let's shift gears back into politics.
[00:25:16.022 --> 00:25:20.027]  You've been very interested in this Glenn Beck clip.
[00:25:20.907 --> 00:25:23.129]  I mean, it's because it's about Ron Paul, really.
[00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:29.474]  I mean, Glenn Beck, like I said, I think is an interesting talking head, but he doesn't say anything that leads me to believe that I want to listen to him.
[00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:41.684]  He just says, when he's talking, it seems to me, a guy who wants you to believe that he makes sense and wants you to believe that, you know, he's a sensible man looking out for you.
[00:25:41.704 --> 00:25:43.145]  To me, he seems like a showman.
[00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:53.591]  I mean, it does come off as kind of a hokey pitch, or as a $3 bill.
[00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:58.294]  I want to play part of this clip in a minute so you can hear it, but first off, your view of Ron Paul?
[00:25:58.614 --> 00:26:04.317]  Well, I think he's the only guy that's saying, listen, we need a radical restructuring of our government.
[00:26:04.597 --> 00:26:08.859]  And he's absolutely correct, and he is what a real conservative is supposed to be.
[00:26:09.139 --> 00:26:17.483]  I mean, by all stretches of the imagination, I mean, that guy's a real... I mean, there's no way you can say by any stretch of the imagination that he's not a conservative.
[00:26:17.503 --> 00:26:18.964]  I mean, he's a real conservative.
[00:26:19.184 --> 00:26:24.526]  A fiscal conservative, a social conservative, but he wants people to be able to do whatever they want.
[00:26:24.546 --> 00:26:25.807]  He believes in states' rights.
[00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:29.088]  He believes that the federal government is completely out of control.
[00:26:29.108 --> 00:26:30.008]  That it's too big.
[00:26:30.068 --> 00:26:33.529]  He believes that, you know, we have to get rid of the IRS.
[00:26:33.569 --> 00:26:34.790]  It's a flawed institution.
[00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.670]  He believes we have to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.251]  He believes all these things that totally make sense.
[00:26:39.491 --> 00:26:42.152]  And when he says these things on TV, they laugh.
[00:26:42.272 --> 00:26:43.332]  And they make it like it's a joke.
[00:26:43.352 --> 00:26:47.914]  Like, even though we know that the system is completely... It's just completely...
[00:26:49.938 --> 00:26:50.579]  Unfixable.
[00:26:50.859 --> 00:27:01.689]  I mean, if you look at the way it is now, just it's a honeycomb of corruption and just bureaucratic BS and red tape and it's just... God, it's so gigantic!
[00:27:01.729 --> 00:27:02.550]  That's my next question.
[00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.311]  Let's continue along Ron Paul.
[00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:04.112]  It's a business.
[00:27:04.172 --> 00:27:05.713]  The government is a business.
[00:27:05.973 --> 00:27:14.021]  And we need... The way this world is structured, it's almost like we need that business to keep running in this ridiculous manner in order to keep people working.
[00:27:14.201 --> 00:27:14.361]  Yeah.
[00:27:14.381 --> 00:27:14.842]  Like a drug war.
[00:27:14.862 --> 00:27:15.182]  It's predatory.
[00:27:15.202 --> 00:27:15.903]  It is predatory.
[00:27:16.543 --> 00:27:17.784]  It feeds on other people.
[00:27:17.804 --> 00:27:20.327]  I mean, look, the whole idea behind private prisons.
[00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:22.168]  I mean, that's completely insane.
[00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:25.151]  That people can profit off of other people being in jail.
[00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:28.755]  Well, if that's the case, then they're going to support things that make more people go to jail.
[00:27:29.215 --> 00:27:33.636]  It's a hobby to keep somebody caught with a marijuana cigarette in prison making widgets for them.
[00:27:34.357 --> 00:27:35.017]  You're right, they do.
[00:27:35.057 --> 00:27:36.117]  And it's sickening.
[00:27:36.177 --> 00:27:37.157]  It's like cannibalism.
[00:27:37.237 --> 00:27:40.338]  I mean, it's really like a social form of cannibalism.
[00:27:40.378 --> 00:27:42.039]  It's unbelievable that it's legal.
[00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:46.980]  And that's all stuff that Ron Paul, you know, what he stands against.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:56.283]  And any rational, reasonable person who would listen to Ron Paul talk goes, well here's a guy who obviously understands the system, was calling the economic collapse way in advance.
[00:27:56.863 --> 00:28:00.025]  Yeah, I mean, he's a brilliant, brilliant guy, you know?
[00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:02.466]  I mean, he says a lot of stuff that I don't believe in.
[00:28:02.506 --> 00:28:04.207]  Like, he doesn't believe in evolution.
[00:28:04.227 --> 00:28:05.628]  You know, he thinks that evolution's a theory.
[00:28:05.648 --> 00:28:08.470]  But the point is, he isn't going to make you believe what he's saying.
[00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.831]  Exactly.
[00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:14.233]  And that is a true conservative.
[00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:22.698]  He's not a person who's trying to manipulate other people's lives, or change them, or bend them to the will of his convictions.
[00:28:22.738 --> 00:28:25.640]  No, he wants the state to get off people's backs and be themselves.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.020]  Exactly.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.121]  And that brings me to the next issue.
[00:28:27.801 --> 00:28:35.286]  George Bush campaigned to cut government, to not have foreign adventures, to not have wars, but his own documents that have now come out, PNAC show that was their plan all along.
[00:28:35.326 --> 00:28:40.609]  That was a betrayal of true conservatives that drank the Kool-Aid thinking he would reverse what Clinton did.
[00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:43.171]  And then it was far worse than Clinton.
[00:28:44.132 --> 00:28:46.715]  Now with Obama, Bush tripled the size of government.
[00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:48.797]  Now Obama's saying he's going to expand it even more.
[00:28:49.197 --> 00:29:01.350]  He's saying change is even bigger government, bigger state, but the people coming in and these youth brigades and 18 to 24, and it's now on the White House website, forced service, but it's a domestic draft where you do stuff for the government.
[00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.273]  Well, I'm definitely apprehensive of a bigger government, no matter what.
[00:29:05.293 --> 00:29:07.915]  I mean, a bigger government, to me, sounds like more possibilities for problems.
[00:29:22.486 --> 00:29:25.508]  A bigger government that's not this government, you know?
[00:29:25.568 --> 00:29:30.030]  I mean, maybe what he's going to do will add to it in a positive way.
[00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.532]  Well, I'll tell you, he's totally on the bank... I mean, he is the man of the bankers.
[00:29:33.912 --> 00:29:39.335]  He got the banker takeover bill, which then they bait and switch and didn't spend for what they said, and now they're saying the money's secret.
[00:29:39.776 --> 00:29:43.317]  I mean, he... I'm just telling you, Joe, and remember, and I know you're a smart guy, the day of 9-11,
[00:29:44.358 --> 00:29:51.208]  The day of 9-11, I came out and said it's an inside job, here's the evidence.
[00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:52.350]  You were on the air with me.
[00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:52.931]  I remember.
[00:29:52.951 --> 00:29:54.533]  But you know I don't just make things up.
[00:29:54.573 --> 00:29:56.015]  I've got just reams of evidence.
[00:29:56.376 --> 00:29:59.080]  Obama is probably going to end up being like Adolf Hitler.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.043]  I'm saying, I'm saying if you think Bush was bad, prepare yourself.
[00:30:03.263 --> 00:30:03.604]  Really?
[00:30:03.624 --> 00:30:12.071]  You really think that he's going to... I mean, but he seems to be so socially liberal and it seems like he wants to close Guantanamo Bay and he wants to... Uh-huh!
[00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:13.733]  But see if he... Exactly.
[00:30:13.973 --> 00:30:14.373]  Not really.
[00:30:14.393 --> 00:30:16.795]  But ABC News admits they're going to open him up in the U.S.
[00:30:17.336 --> 00:30:26.064]  He's shutting that one down, paying lip service that he's against it, while opening more and leaving the ghost sites in Europe, you know, the real camps open.
[00:30:26.874 --> 00:30:28.515]  And what are these real camps in Europe?
[00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:29.876]  There's a torture camp?
[00:30:30.056 --> 00:30:41.322]  Oh yeah, they're in Romania, they're in Latin America, they are in Jordan, they're in Egypt, they're in Poland, they're in Czech Republic, and it is... Now, but let me ask you this.
[00:30:41.402 --> 00:30:47.885]  If you think that the New World Order is in control of the world, and that they manipulate the world's government, why do they need a Guantanamo Bay?
[00:30:47.905 --> 00:30:49.126]  Why do they need to torture some...
[00:30:49.326 --> 00:30:56.174]  Because why did the Catholic Church need to have inquisitors to torture people to say they'd committed these crimes or witchcraft?
[00:30:56.514 --> 00:30:59.698]  Because they had to legitimize the whole suppression thing they were doing.
[00:30:59.738 --> 00:31:01.740]  They torture you to get fake confessions.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.261]  Here's an example.
[00:31:02.281 --> 00:31:06.105]  Three weeks ago, they roll in, what, six defendants out of Guantanamo.
[00:31:06.126 --> 00:31:07.687]  They've been held between seven and five years.
[00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:19.180]  You know, they were picked up different times, and they go, they're about to plead guilty, and they walk them in, and no video's allowed, but the press is there, and they say, how do you plead?
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.243]  I've been tortured, I've been tortured, don't execute me, it's fake!
[00:31:22.684 --> 00:31:30.332]  But then that was barely in the news, but that was in the news, and so they're cancelling these trials because they've got to take them back and torture them some more.
[00:31:31.015 --> 00:31:34.599]  Well, this is also the first administration in a long time that used mercenaries.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:35.520]  Right?
[00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:36.882]  Yes, and they're keeping all of that.
[00:31:37.943 --> 00:31:42.449]  Blackwater is not only doing that overseas stuff, they're also involved in the war on drugs.
[00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:43.170]  In California.
[00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.013]  Yeah, they're going after medical marijuana dispensaries.
[00:31:46.474 --> 00:31:47.135]  It's incredible.
[00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:49.758]  I mean, there's this... They confiscated guns in New Orleans.
[00:31:52.037 --> 00:31:53.578]  It's spooky, you know?
[00:31:53.718 --> 00:31:59.721]  I mean, I don't understand politics enough to say that I believe that, you know, Barack Obama's going to make a change.
[00:31:59.901 --> 00:32:03.083]  But I think one thing that he's good for is the psyche of the country.
[00:32:03.543 --> 00:32:07.645]  I think that what he represents to people is a new possibility.
[00:32:07.705 --> 00:32:12.968]  The fact that a guy who is a half-black guy from a single mom, like, can make it.
[00:32:12.988 --> 00:32:14.569]  No, that's a positive thing.
[00:32:14.589 --> 00:32:15.930]  We're going to come back and talk about that.
[00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.572]  The problem is, he's going to make everybody love their slavery
[00:32:19.992 --> 00:32:22.435]  As this agenda happens and makes them feel good.
[00:32:22.635 --> 00:32:27.521]  Maybe he infiltrated, maybe he got into the system and he's gonna clean it up from the inside.
[00:32:27.721 --> 00:32:29.103]  With Secretary of Defense Gates?
[00:32:29.123 --> 00:32:32.467]  Well maybe he knows that the Anunnaki are coming and the world ends in 2012.
[00:32:32.988 --> 00:32:34.470]  Stay there Joe Rogan, stay with us.
[00:32:35.478 --> 00:32:37.319]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:32:37.459 --> 00:32:42.643]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:32:42.823 --> 00:32:44.144]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:32:44.425 --> 00:32:52.591]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:32:52.831 --> 00:32:58.555]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:32:58.715 --> 00:33:00.497]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:33:00.557 --> 00:33:02.719]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:33:02.739 --> 00:33:07.122]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:33:07.283 --> 00:33:09.384]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:33:09.504 --> 00:33:16.971]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:33:35.122 --> 00:33:41.406]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:33:41.787 --> 00:33:43.448]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:33:44.586 --> 00:33:45.427]  Who is the enemy?
[00:33:45.948 --> 00:33:46.448]  Bin Laden.
[00:33:46.748 --> 00:33:47.729]  This is his ammo.
[00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.051]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:50.753]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:33:51.113 --> 00:33:57.860]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:58.701]  Some U.S.
[00:33:58.741 --> 00:34:04.407]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:34:05.087 --> 00:34:08.569]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:11.390]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:35.121]  Good day.
[00:34:35.281 --> 00:34:36.843]  Jim Newcomer from IDIS Resources.
[00:34:36.963 --> 00:34:37.303]  January 19, 2009.
[00:34:37.383 --> 00:34:38.484]  Gold opened this morning at $836.90.
[00:34:38.524 --> 00:34:41.686]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $861.80, $430.90 for a half ounce, and $215.45 for the quarter ounce.
[00:34:41.726 --> 00:34:42.347]  That's $861.80, $430.90, and $215.45.
[00:34:52.054 --> 00:34:57.781]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:34:57.841 --> 00:35:01.825]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a Yan revolution.
[00:35:02.045 --> 00:35:10.134]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:35:10.154 --> 00:35:12.517]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:35:12.717 --> 00:35:13.338]  We're good.
[00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:36.426]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:35:36.606 --> 00:35:38.067]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:35:38.367 --> 00:35:40.589]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:45.794]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:35:46.175 --> 00:35:49.017]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:35:49.378 --> 00:35:52.841]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:35:53.277 --> 00:36:05.269]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.812]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:09.133]  I use one every day.
[00:36:09.553 --> 00:36:12.016]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:36:12.296 --> 00:36:12.996]  Before you slip into
[00:36:40.328 --> 00:37:03.177]  Unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss, another kiss
[00:37:13.991 --> 00:37:25.720]  The days are bright and filled with pain Enclose me in your gentle reign The time
[00:37:35.946 --> 00:37:37.706]  JoeRogan.net is the website.
[00:37:37.766 --> 00:37:40.527]  It's got a huge MySpace with millions of people.
[00:37:40.547 --> 00:37:45.768]  Joe, what's the best site for folks to check out for all your comedy, your material, the work you're doing, your political statements?
[00:37:46.088 --> 00:37:48.348]  JoeRogan.net's the best site to check out.
[00:37:48.608 --> 00:37:55.430]  I have a Facebook page and a MySpace page and everything, and I do go on those, but my website, JoeRogan.net, is where I do most of my stuff.
[00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:59.830]  And then I have a message board on JoeRogan.net that I'm on pretty much every day.
[00:38:00.671 --> 00:38:02.871]  Continuing with Barack Obama, just
[00:38:05.024 --> 00:38:12.028]  He's created a separate USAService.org, never before done, under himself, private.
[00:38:12.868 --> 00:38:13.429]  What does that mean?
[00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:18.651]  And they're running national, it's not government, they're running national TV ads as government ads saying join this.
[00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:21.173]  It's gotten hundreds of thousands of members in a week and a half.
[00:38:22.284 --> 00:38:37.478]  And when you study history that is classical fascism or Mao Zedong communism when you know Mao had his own private group of youth and then on top of that I'm sure you've heard they won 18 to 24 forced compulsory a new domestic army as big as the US military?
[00:38:38.752 --> 00:38:40.253]  That's what Obama wants?
[00:38:40.653 --> 00:38:41.174]  Absolutely.
[00:38:41.214 --> 00:38:42.214]  You want me to pull the clips?
[00:38:42.675 --> 00:38:45.397]  Well, tell me, yeah, explain it to me.
[00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:46.437]  This is what he wants?
[00:38:46.477 --> 00:38:49.579]  He wants a youth army for domestic issues?
[00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:51.701]  Yes, and they're talking about... Voluntary?
[00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:53.202]  No, compulsory.
[00:38:53.402 --> 00:38:58.185]  There's one that's compulsory, but he can have a separate volunteer corps that's private under him.
[00:38:59.306 --> 00:39:00.867]  Running with government money on TV.
[00:39:01.668 --> 00:39:01.908]  Wow.
[00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:11.155]  I mean, isn't it dangerous anytime in history when they say, get behind this guy and he'll fix it?
[00:39:11.863 --> 00:39:13.344]  Yes, I think it's always dangerous.
[00:39:13.444 --> 00:39:17.547]  And I think right now we're very desperate for something to bring us back to normal.
[00:39:17.567 --> 00:39:19.988]  I mean, people were living in fantasy land for a long time.
[00:39:20.389 --> 00:39:23.111]  You know, they got wealthy with very little effort.
[00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:26.793]  And I think people just want that to come back again.
[00:39:26.853 --> 00:39:31.416]  They want our economy to blossom to the ridiculous proportions that it was in in the past.
[00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:34.658]  So they'll drink the Kool-Aid if the Kool-Aid server claims they'll bring Valhalla back.
[00:39:34.858 --> 00:39:35.099]  Right.
[00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:38.641]  You know, but who knows what his motivation is?
[00:39:38.661 --> 00:39:40.422]  I mean, his motivation may be pure.
[00:39:40.442 --> 00:39:41.543]  I mean, his motivation may
[00:39:42.305 --> 00:39:46.121]  Very well be that he's trying to fix the predicament that we're in, or...
[00:39:46.954 --> 00:39:49.576]  He may be a New World Order shill, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:49.956 --> 00:39:51.618]  I have him on video calling for a New World Order.
[00:39:51.978 --> 00:39:52.859]  Oh, what's he saying?
[00:39:53.299 --> 00:39:55.080]  He said we all want a New World Order.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.121]  Is that what he said?
[00:39:56.321 --> 00:39:56.562]  Yeah.
[00:39:57.042 --> 00:40:01.546]  Well, do you think that people, when they say a New World Order, do they mean like a new order to the world?
[00:40:01.566 --> 00:40:02.326]  Well, they've all written books.
[00:40:02.346 --> 00:40:05.849]  Or do they mean like New World Order as in like Darth Vader type stuff?
[00:40:05.869 --> 00:40:07.751]  Well, his advisors have written books about what they mean.
[00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:08.811]  What did they say?
[00:40:08.831 --> 00:40:14.336]  Like Rahm Emanuel said, national force service, everyone will have to serve, and they say the New World Order means a world government.
[00:40:15.488 --> 00:40:16.231]  One world government.
[00:40:16.311 --> 00:40:18.662]  Run by the private banks.
[00:40:18.823 --> 00:40:19.506]  What a good idea.
[00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:23.170]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:28.631]  I mean, we're never going to get to the point where, you know, I give you gold and, you know, and you give me a side of beef.
[00:40:28.771 --> 00:40:30.372]  You know, we're not going to get to that spot anymore.
[00:40:30.392 --> 00:40:34.012]  You know, it's always going to be dictated by money and credit.
[00:40:34.412 --> 00:40:35.873]  Things just get so ethereal.
[00:40:35.893 --> 00:40:36.573]  They just get so intangible.
[00:40:36.773 --> 00:40:40.333]  And because they control it, and because they control that ether, they rule.
[00:40:40.753 --> 00:40:42.894]  I showed you this article out of the LA Times two days ago.
[00:40:43.294 --> 00:40:43.654]  What is this?
[00:40:43.854 --> 00:40:48.655]  The woman's children spilt the Bloody Mary, were fighting, so she spatted one on the leg.
[00:40:49.455 --> 00:40:50.616]  Oh, she hit it?
[00:40:50.796 --> 00:40:51.356]  She hit the kid?
[00:40:51.376 --> 00:40:54.237]  Well, but she wasn't charged, because spanking isn't illegal, hurting them is.
[00:40:54.438 --> 00:40:54.658]  Okay.
[00:40:54.858 --> 00:40:57.579]  She was charged with a disturbance as a terrorist on a plane.
[00:40:58.059 --> 00:40:58.720]  Right.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.521]  And was given a big prison sentence.
[00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:02.001]  Let me just read it.
[00:41:02.642 --> 00:41:03.742]  A prison sentence?
[00:41:03.802 --> 00:41:06.403]  In-flight confrontations can lead to terrorism charges.
[00:41:06.443 --> 00:41:09.225]  Reporting from Los Angeles and Oklahoma City, Tamara Jo Freeman was on the
[00:41:09.705 --> 00:41:17.390]  Frontier Airlines flight to Denver in 2007 when her two children began to quarrel, she's a reporter, over the window shade and then spilled a Bloody Mary in her lap.
[00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.532]  She spanked each of them on the thigh with three swats.
[00:41:19.552 --> 00:41:25.636]  It was a small incident, but one that highlighted the anxiety of September 11th attacks, would eventually have enormous ramifications for Freeman and her children.
[00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:31.219]  A flight attendant confronted Freeman, who was reported by hurling a few profanities, and then it goes on.
[00:41:31.259 --> 00:41:38.965]  The incident aboard the Frontier flight ultimately led to Freeman's arrest and conviction for a federal felony defined as an act of terrorism under the USA Patriot Act.
[00:41:40.246 --> 00:41:43.994]  The controversial federal law enacted after 2001 attacks in Washington.
[00:41:44.375 --> 00:41:48.924]  They arrested her, didn't allow her to have a lawyer under terror charges for three months until she pled guilty.
[00:41:50.532 --> 00:41:52.253]  So she was locked up for three months?
[00:41:53.154 --> 00:41:54.035]  Until she pled guilty.
[00:41:54.055 --> 00:41:55.315]  That's what they do in the Patriot Act.
[00:41:55.335 --> 00:42:00.779]  But then it goes on to say, 200 people alone on flights charged with terrorism for as much as arguing.
[00:42:00.799 --> 00:42:01.940]  It says that.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:06.743]  Well, they do have, like, a lot of flight attendants, especially, do have this crazy attitude.
[00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:14.209]  Like, when they tell you to shut off your phone if you didn't listen to them, you know, if you weren't paying attention, you know, and they'll come over you like they're soldiers.
[00:42:14.669 --> 00:42:17.031]  You know, it gets like they have the power to get rid of you.
[00:42:17.371 --> 00:42:19.232]  You know, sir, I will ask you off this plane.
[00:42:20.473 --> 00:42:21.054]  Joe, stay there.
[00:42:21.094 --> 00:42:21.474]  Quick break.
[00:42:21.514 --> 00:42:22.495]  Long segment coming up.
[00:42:22.595 --> 00:42:24.757]  You want to take calls?
[00:42:24.837 --> 00:42:25.317]  Yes.
[00:42:25.337 --> 00:42:25.497]  800-259-9231.
[00:42:25.537 --> 00:42:26.418]  We're on the march.
[00:42:26.898 --> 00:42:28.500]  The empire's on the run.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.203]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:42:35.705 --> 00:42:38.568]  Hello, this is Tom with hempusa.org.
[00:42:39.088 --> 00:42:46.234]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[00:42:46.812 --> 00:42:54.059]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[00:42:54.619 --> 00:43:00.985]  At hempusa.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[00:43:01.546 --> 00:43:08.032]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:43:08.332 --> 00:43:10.614]  Beware, be smart, and be ready!
[00:43:11.101 --> 00:43:11.861]  On September 11, 2001, along with
[00:43:38.499 --> 00:43:40.762]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:43:41.022 --> 00:43:42.363]  And we knew what to do.
[00:43:42.383 --> 00:43:44.125]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:43:44.346 --> 00:43:50.773]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:43:51.373 --> 00:43:59.903]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:07.076]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:44:07.376 --> 00:44:10.439]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:44:10.539 --> 00:44:15.764]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

[00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:36.956]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[00:44:37.276 --> 00:44:38.417]  eFoods does it again.
[00:44:38.658 --> 00:44:43.442]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[00:44:43.762 --> 00:44:48.046]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[00:44:54.957 --> 00:45:00.040]  You'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:07.004]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:08.945]  Food is an everyday need.
[00:45:09.545 --> 00:45:13.387]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing
[00:45:16.018 --> 00:45:16.698]  We're good to go!
[00:45:51.945 --> 00:45:57.671]  We're gonna open the phones up, the network.
[00:45:57.711 --> 00:45:59.232]  Please give me the new call list, 800-259-9231.
[00:46:07.642 --> 00:46:09.383]  Talk to Joe Rogan here in studio.
[00:46:09.403 --> 00:46:11.704]  The police chief will come about 10-15 minutes after.
[00:46:11.724 --> 00:46:17.087]  And I'm tempted to bring the police chief in here and ask him police state questions and have Joe jump on him.
[00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:17.827]  Oh, whoa.
[00:46:17.867 --> 00:46:19.048]  Not while I'm here.
[00:46:19.508 --> 00:46:20.789]  I'll do that over the phone.
[00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:22.810]  I don't want to get arrested pulling out of the station.
[00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:24.991]  I didn't mean physically jump on him.
[00:46:25.031 --> 00:46:25.692]  No, I know what you mean.
[00:46:25.732 --> 00:46:27.714]  I mean, talk to him, jump on him is a bad idea.
[00:46:27.754 --> 00:46:28.635]  But I meant that as a joke.
[00:46:28.655 --> 00:46:29.876]  The police chief's a nice, friendly guy.
[00:46:30.397 --> 00:46:32.218]  You know, I found out from folks that it doesn't matter.
[00:46:32.239 --> 00:46:33.219]  It doesn't matter?
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.902]  Point is, he goes around at the police station doing Alex Jones imitations.
[00:46:36.563 --> 00:46:37.684]  Oh, nice.
[00:46:37.964 --> 00:46:39.906]  So we heard the police chief was friendly towards us.
[00:46:39.946 --> 00:46:40.907]  I don't really like what he's doing.
[00:46:41.167 --> 00:46:43.630]  He does forced blood draws at checkpoints here in Austin.
[00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:45.411]  They draw- what?
[00:46:45.471 --> 00:46:47.632]  And so we called him up and he agreed to come in the studio last night.
[00:46:47.652 --> 00:46:48.793]  Forced blood draws?
[00:46:48.913 --> 00:46:49.173]  Yes.
[00:46:49.353 --> 00:46:50.474]  Now why do they do blood draws?
[00:46:50.494 --> 00:46:52.655]  Is that a more accurate way of detecting alcohol in the system?
[00:46:52.675 --> 00:46:53.816]  Yeah, but it violates the Fourth Amendment.
[00:46:53.836 --> 00:46:56.757]  You're supposed to be able to refuse that or they're supposed to get a warrant, but they don't.
[00:46:56.777 --> 00:46:59.759]  They have these rubber stamp warrants and they use the Patriot Act to do it.
[00:47:00.439 --> 00:47:00.820]  Wow.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.221]  But he's real nice, he'll give you all these excuses for it.
[00:47:03.621 --> 00:47:05.843]  He's like, oh Alex, I like your show, I heard you say this, I heard you do that.
[00:47:05.863 --> 00:47:07.083]  And what's his excuse for taking your blood?
[00:47:07.103 --> 00:47:07.964]  And he'll do an Alex Jones imitation.
[00:47:08.204 --> 00:47:09.985]  I'll tell you right now, we're gonna- I'm sorry.
[00:47:10.025 --> 00:47:11.526]  What's his excuse for taking your blood?
[00:47:12.206 --> 00:47:13.307]  To catch the alcohol in it.
[00:47:15.222 --> 00:47:21.065]  If you refuse to give a breathalyzer at a checkpoint, which is your Fourth Amendment right, the courts have said what they're doing is illegal.
[00:47:21.525 --> 00:47:23.206]  Do they prick your finger?
[00:47:23.346 --> 00:47:24.227]  No, they suck.
[00:47:24.287 --> 00:47:27.488]  The cops hold you down if need be and suck it out of an eye.
[00:47:27.508 --> 00:47:28.329]  They do an IV?
[00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:29.469]  Like they go into your vein?
[00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:30.990]  Yeah, like when you take blood when you go to the doctor.
[00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.651]  That's hilarious.
[00:47:31.671 --> 00:47:33.792]  You're going to trust cops to do that?
[00:47:34.881 --> 00:47:35.522]  They tried.
[00:47:35.802 --> 00:47:38.024]  They've done it like in Tucson and Austin and a few other cities.
[00:47:38.785 --> 00:47:39.646]  They tried it in Indiana.
[00:47:40.067 --> 00:47:41.028]  Four or five states are trying it.
[00:47:41.588 --> 00:47:42.469]  Cities in four or five states.
[00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.151]  And the hospitals refuse.
[00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:47.014]  They show up without warrants saying, take this guy's blood and the hospital's going to know.
[00:47:47.034 --> 00:47:49.056]  What if it's like a giant fat guy and you can't get a vein?
[00:47:49.817 --> 00:47:51.639]  Cops just keep plunging them in.
[00:47:51.659 --> 00:47:55.644]  I was going to say something dirty.
[00:48:00.438 --> 00:48:03.501]  Well, Joe, after we got caught with that satanic video we did.
[00:48:03.801 --> 00:48:07.826]  Yes, the satanic video we did in the bathroom of the State Capitol House.
[00:48:08.306 --> 00:48:09.027]  What is that building?
[00:48:09.447 --> 00:48:09.928]  Was that a building?
[00:48:09.988 --> 00:48:11.149]  Is that a State Capitol building?
[00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.970]  Beautiful building.
[00:48:12.971 --> 00:48:13.311]  Oh, man.
[00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:14.292]  Smoked pot in that bathroom.
[00:48:16.314 --> 00:48:17.215]  I didn't know you did that.
[00:48:17.976 --> 00:48:18.717]  You didn't do that.
[00:48:18.837 --> 00:48:19.698]  We did it on video, man.
[00:48:19.718 --> 00:48:20.539]  What are you talking about?
[00:48:21.292 --> 00:48:22.412]  I don't smoke pot!
[00:48:22.632 --> 00:48:23.032]  I did.
[00:48:23.673 --> 00:48:24.093]  You didn't.
[00:48:24.413 --> 00:48:26.033]  Joe, your memory... You said it made you paranoid.
[00:48:26.333 --> 00:48:27.214]  We have it on video.
[00:48:27.454 --> 00:48:28.714]  Your memory is getting clouded.
[00:48:28.974 --> 00:48:29.994]  No, we have it on video.
[00:48:30.054 --> 00:48:33.435]  You were in the... No, it's in the Cap City bathroom.
[00:48:33.655 --> 00:48:35.996]  We pretended it was the bathroom of the Capitol Building.
[00:48:36.156 --> 00:48:37.376]  Yes, yes, for the film.
[00:48:37.536 --> 00:48:37.916]  Exactly.
[00:48:37.936 --> 00:48:38.836]  Okay, I was freaking out.
[00:48:38.876 --> 00:48:39.837]  No, no, I'm just playing.
[00:48:39.897 --> 00:48:41.717]  I was saying, oh my God, SWAT teams are on there.
[00:48:41.737 --> 00:48:42.317]  We did not do that.
[00:48:42.878 --> 00:48:43.658]  We did not do that.
[00:48:43.718 --> 00:48:44.638]  No, we did not do that.
[00:48:46.232 --> 00:48:46.772]  Oh my God.
[00:48:46.792 --> 00:48:47.533]  You're a little nervous.
[00:48:48.093 --> 00:48:52.435]  Well, no, because people are going to... I shouldn't even joke and say it was a secret satanic ceremony.
[00:48:53.076 --> 00:49:01.080]  Because it's a video sold in stores, but people grab it and again... How could it be a satanic ceremony if we have rubber George Bush masks on?
[00:49:04.778 --> 00:49:06.559]  They say they caught me, they say it's secret.
[00:49:07.499 --> 00:49:19.466]  It's like every week we talk here on air and then kind of behind the scenes, internet stream only, I'll talk to guests sometimes and then people grab that and say, look this was Alex Jones caught secretly saying this as if that makes it more special.
[00:49:19.486 --> 00:49:21.968]  Well that is the problem with the internet.
[00:49:22.408 --> 00:49:22.588]  Yeah.
[00:49:22.608 --> 00:49:25.971]  Well, also with the internet, there's so much of you out there.
[00:49:26.011 --> 00:49:34.537]  There's so many times that you've talked, so many times you've been on the radio, and all of it is available to dissect, and you could always find something.
[00:49:34.557 --> 00:49:40.141]  I mean, if you follow me all day, every day, for sure I'm going to be a retard 25, 30 minutes a day.
[00:49:40.161 --> 00:49:44.605]  If you chopped that up and just only showed that, you would go, God, that guy's retarded.
[00:49:45.005 --> 00:49:46.486]  Well, they do worse than that.
[00:49:46.506 --> 00:49:51.730]  I'll be speaking out against racists, and then they edit it together, where I'm saying, kill black people.
[00:49:52.991 --> 00:49:58.255]  In fact, they've edited it together where I've talked about in Tennessee or in Denver when white supremacists tried to get Obama.
[00:49:58.656 --> 00:50:00.858]  They edit that together where it's me saying I'm going to get him.
[00:50:00.978 --> 00:50:07.664]  Well, it's going to get really squirrely when people can actually imitate your voice exactly with a computer and that's not too far away.
[00:50:07.684 --> 00:50:08.945]  Well, the government's already got it, but yeah.
[00:50:09.045 --> 00:50:09.565]  I'm sure.
[00:50:09.605 --> 00:50:12.246]  I mean, sound is, you know, you can manipulate sound.
[00:50:12.266 --> 00:50:19.908]  I mean, you look at what they can do with CGI, what they can do with computer graphics, and make, you know, computer games look so realistic, and of course, what they can do in movies.
[00:50:20.268 --> 00:50:21.788]  I mean, it's incredible now.
[00:50:22.068 --> 00:50:31.211]  I mean, they're going to be able to do that with sound, and at a certain point in time, they are going to be able to say whatever they want, and write it out, and have a computer literally speak.
[00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:31.951]  You know?
[00:50:32.071 --> 00:50:36.212]  So, it could be an exact replica of Alex Jones' voice.
[00:50:37.199 --> 00:50:38.241]  You want to be necessary.
[00:50:38.441 --> 00:50:41.625]  The New World Order will tell everybody what needs to be done.
[00:50:41.685 --> 00:50:45.230]  They'll have you in here like, what's that dude that died?
[00:50:45.551 --> 00:50:46.312]  Weekend at Bernie's?
[00:50:46.732 --> 00:50:47.513]  That's who you'll be.
[00:50:47.594 --> 00:50:48.655]  You'll have a stick up your ass.
[00:50:48.735 --> 00:50:49.616]  You'll be sitting in that chair.
[00:50:50.905 --> 00:50:53.526]  And they'll just have your lips move CGI style.
[00:50:53.666 --> 00:50:55.906]  I've decided George Bush is an alright guy.
[00:50:56.226 --> 00:50:57.467]  I've decided I like Obama.
[00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:59.947]  Meanwhile, I'm wearing cement shoes in Lake Tahoe.
[00:51:00.007 --> 00:51:00.548]  Exactly.
[00:51:00.808 --> 00:51:03.248]  And Alex Jones just goes on forever.
[00:51:03.288 --> 00:51:03.889]  You're all CGI.
[00:51:03.969 --> 00:51:06.209]  I used to believe in the New World Order, but it doesn't exist.
[00:51:06.489 --> 00:51:08.570]  Now let's cut to the New World Order capital and the world leader.
[00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.710]  Exactly.
[00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.831]  All your friends will be like, man, it just doesn't seem like Alex.
[00:51:13.598 --> 00:51:28.325]  Well, you know, some of the top techies at Wired Magazine and some of the top video analysts in the country, and also in Canada and France, they analyzed that one Bin Laden tape where it looks like
[00:51:29.397 --> 00:51:35.082]  Kind of the generic, uh, anime, uh, Final Fantasy model they use and they just put a beard on it.
[00:51:35.282 --> 00:51:35.462]  Right.
[00:51:35.542 --> 00:51:38.785]  And you can see it's not even a good, uh, fake.
[00:51:38.805 --> 00:51:45.951]  And then they did voice analyzation, uh, in two different countries and said, and had linguists listen, and they ran the real Bin Laden's voice through a voice key.
[00:51:46.451 --> 00:51:51.293]  And then they ran the fake Bin Laden voice through and said, number one, it's not even near the voice key, so it's not him.
[00:51:51.774 --> 00:51:52.794]  Wouldn't pass the voice key.
[00:51:53.154 --> 00:52:05.040]  But then they had linguists listen and said, no, that's a Westerner who did grow up in the Middle East, probably Jordan, they can even tell the inflections, who's lived in the West most of their life or all their life, who then did the voiceover for it.
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.962]  So they proved... So some language expert that just recreated it.
[00:52:08.982 --> 00:52:09.542]  Yeah, two of them.
[00:52:09.642 --> 00:52:09.762]  Yes.
[00:52:09.782 --> 00:52:09.882]  Yes.
[00:52:09.902 --> 00:52:10.042]  Yes.
[00:52:10.062 --> 00:52:10.182]  Yes.
[00:52:26.914 --> 00:52:29.517]  And then there was another video that they put out.
[00:52:29.658 --> 00:52:30.359]  Which makes sense.
[00:52:30.379 --> 00:52:37.468]  I mean, if you want to scare people, you want to scare people, and you get one wacky dude that wants to go camping in Iraq, let's just cut his head off.
[00:52:37.588 --> 00:52:38.529]  Let me tell one more story.
[00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:40.732]  Folks, show, throw up a video graphic.
[00:52:41.012 --> 00:52:43.075]  Throw up theprisonplanet.com a show.
[00:52:43.135 --> 00:52:43.876]  Throw up that graphic.
[00:52:43.936 --> 00:52:44.997]  I'm going to show folks.
[00:52:45.758 --> 00:52:54.745]  If you analyze this graphic, and this is Easy Technology, and Wired Magazine did this, if you analyze this graphic, you will see that it was originally put in in the first generation video layer.
[00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:55.726]  Okay?
[00:52:56.446 --> 00:53:08.275]  With the Bin Laden videos, put out by a group called the Intel Center, which the head guy at it, admittedly, is the protégé of Donald Rumsfeld, who didn't just work at the Pentagon, he worked in psych warfare for two decades at the Pentagon.
[00:53:08.795 --> 00:53:13.439]  So the former head of psych warfare under Rumsfeld, when he was previously in the Department of Defense,
[00:53:14.665 --> 00:53:14.986]  Okay.
[00:53:15.687 --> 00:53:21.075]  He puts out a... They're the ones that always release the Bin Laden videos.
[00:53:21.676 --> 00:53:27.886]  And then they found that the Al-Qaeda bug was put in in the same video layer as the Intel Center bug.
[00:53:29.514 --> 00:53:29.834]  Wow.
[00:53:30.655 --> 00:53:40.166]  Well, you know, the most hilarious connection ever with our government and illegal things was that crashed plane that had been to Guantanamo Bay several times.
[00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:40.746]  Oh yeah.
[00:53:40.766 --> 00:53:43.289]  It was filled with cocaine that crashed in Mexico.
[00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:45.131]  I mean, that's just genius.
[00:53:45.611 --> 00:53:46.472]  That's just beautiful.
[00:53:47.153 --> 00:53:57.022]  When people don't want to believe that the government's capable of selling drugs, and there's people that see billions and billions of dollars being transferred through the hands of criminals, you don't think they would want to get in on that?
[00:53:57.322 --> 00:54:02.327]  You know, a government that willingly lets people sell cigarettes in this country, you know, because they're being paid off.
[00:54:02.367 --> 00:54:07.272]  They know that cigarettes kill 400,000 people a year, every year, just in this country alone, and nobody cares.
[00:54:07.352 --> 00:54:10.775]  I mean, there's no politicians that are pushing to get cigarettes outlawed.
[00:54:11.135 --> 00:54:11.955]  You know, they don't care.
[00:54:11.975 --> 00:54:14.836]  They don't mind cocaine getting into this country as long as they can profit on it.
[00:54:15.156 --> 00:54:18.977]  And the way they profit that way is just pure, pure profit, you know?
[00:54:18.997 --> 00:54:20.497]  I mean, they've been doing that forever.
[00:54:20.537 --> 00:54:32.779]  If you look at the story of Barry Seal and Mina Arkansas, you know, and what happened with him, the guy was about to testify that he had been smuggling cocaine into the United States forever with the CIA and they shot him.
[00:54:33.139 --> 00:54:36.000]  When they shot him, he had George Bush's home phone number in his pocket.
[00:54:37.955 --> 00:54:40.297]  Yeah, that came out.
[00:54:40.317 --> 00:54:44.400]  I mean, if you look into that story, the government has been selling drugs for a long time.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:53.686]  It's quite interesting that we're in a war on drugs when it's very possible that the government is probably the number one distributor of cocaine in this whole country.
[00:54:53.906 --> 00:54:54.627]  And heroin.
[00:54:55.047 --> 00:55:02.152]  Well, you notice that after they went into Afghanistan, record, within two years, record amount of opium coming out of Afghanistan.
[00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:07.197]  Yeah, I mean, isn't that like a gigantic percentage of the world's opium supplies is all from Afghanistan?
[00:55:07.257 --> 00:55:07.397]  Yeah, 80%.
[00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:08.959]  Yeah, they control that stuff.
[00:55:09.019 --> 00:55:10.320]  I mean, if they control, why would they?
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.983]  There's just, you're not going to stop junkies.
[00:55:13.423 --> 00:55:15.766]  People are addicted to opiates, they're going to stay addicted.
[00:55:16.066 --> 00:55:20.250]  I mean, a vast majority of them, you know, and they're going to want that stuff.
[00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:21.031]  There's a demand.
[00:55:21.332 --> 00:55:22.072]  And that demand is...
[00:55:22.913 --> 00:55:24.293]  To the tune of billions of dollars.
[00:55:24.333 --> 00:55:25.634]  That's the same with the Vietnam War.
[00:55:26.014 --> 00:55:28.735]  You know, the Vietnam War, it was a huge junk running scheme.
[00:55:28.755 --> 00:55:30.555]  I mean, that was a big part of the war.
[00:55:31.055 --> 00:55:42.458]  You know, I mean, if you look into, I mean, like Kevin Booth's documentary was really good on the drug war, but if you look in the way our economy is structured, it's almost like drugs have to be illegal.
[00:55:42.498 --> 00:55:45.379]  It's almost like that's a part of the whole system itself.
[00:55:46.374 --> 00:55:46.854]  Absolutely.
[00:55:46.874 --> 00:55:56.562]  If you go back, Skull and Bones was founded by the British back in 1832 with opium money from the British East India Company.
[00:55:56.602 --> 00:55:57.903]  That was their main product after tea.
[00:55:58.383 --> 00:56:02.426]  And so when they made alcohol illegal so they could jack up prices, that went away.
[00:56:02.526 --> 00:56:10.932]  They then created drug prohibition before cocaine and heroin was sold in all the drug stores to then make it nouveau riche, to make it popular, to jack up the prices.
[00:56:11.313 --> 00:56:15.876]  And so, of course, they've been bringing the drugs in all along and they made it illegal to jack up the price.
[00:56:16.056 --> 00:56:18.198]  It's amazing that people don't want to hear stuff like this.
[00:56:18.218 --> 00:56:21.900]  They hear things like that and they think it's just wacky conspiracy theories.
[00:56:22.241 --> 00:56:22.921]  Mainline history.
[00:56:23.081 --> 00:56:24.242]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:56:25.243 --> 00:56:27.464]  It's history and it's history that's going on right now.
[00:56:27.845 --> 00:56:29.226]  And people don't want to believe it.
[00:56:29.806 --> 00:56:32.008]  It's kind of interesting.
[00:56:32.028 --> 00:56:34.770]  It's interesting how much we're willing to bury our head in the sand.
[00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:41.054]  But why is it bad when there's tens of thousands of studies and now hundreds of uses by mainline medical systems for
[00:56:42.575 --> 00:56:45.917]  The HTC, the chemicals that are in marijuana.
[00:56:46.638 --> 00:56:50.100]  But then, you don't take Prozac, but you like to smoke a little bit of marijuana.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.421]  And you're a criminal.
[00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:52.141]  It's ridiculous.
[00:56:52.161 --> 00:56:53.282]  It's because they can't control it.
[00:56:53.322 --> 00:56:54.243]  It's because it's a plant.
[00:56:54.303 --> 00:56:54.963]  It's that simple.
[00:56:55.023 --> 00:56:58.286]  It's like, you can't control people growing a plant.
[00:56:58.526 --> 00:56:59.987]  So you have to make that plant illegal.
[00:57:00.047 --> 00:57:01.087]  You can't patent it.
[00:57:01.368 --> 00:57:12.195]  You can't, you know, pharmaceutical companies, if it's gonna kill a hundred of their different products, if marijuana is a healthier, more natural substitute for a hundred of their products, they fight against it.
[00:57:12.635 --> 00:57:19.219]  You know, what's really fascinating is that Schedule 1 drugs in this country, the ones that are the most illegal, oftentimes are the safest.
[00:57:19.579 --> 00:57:21.100]  Marijuana, Schedule 1 drug.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.081]  Never killed anyone, but Prozac?
[00:57:23.101 --> 00:57:23.661]  Exactly.
[00:57:23.741 --> 00:57:27.703]  They admit over 300,000 deaths a year from prescription drugs.
[00:57:27.743 --> 00:57:28.744]  Well, even crystal meth.
[00:57:28.824 --> 00:57:30.625]  Crystal meth, heroin, those are Schedule 2.
[00:57:31.445 --> 00:57:31.725]  You know?
[00:57:31.805 --> 00:57:32.726]  Cocaine is Schedule 2.
[00:57:33.006 --> 00:57:37.770]  Marijuana is more illegal and, you know, and supposedly more dangerous than all that.
[00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:39.131]  Meanwhile, it's never killed anyone.
[00:57:39.531 --> 00:57:40.872]  Man, I always use this statistic.
[00:57:40.892 --> 00:57:43.114]  150 people die every year because coconuts fall on their head. 150.
[00:57:45.277 --> 00:57:46.098]  Zero from politics.
[00:57:46.118 --> 00:57:48.722]  Here's a statistic I always use when people talk about mixed martial arts, how dangerous it is.
[00:58:01.699 --> 00:58:08.650]  More people have died from girls cheerleading since 1984 than have died doing martial arts.
[00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:09.912]  It's those big pyramids they do.
[00:58:09.952 --> 00:58:11.494]  They're like 20 feet in the air and fall in there.
[00:58:11.514 --> 00:58:12.316]  Let me throw them.
[00:58:12.336 --> 00:58:14.679]  Four people have died, four girls have died since 1980, I think 82 or 84.
[00:58:16.627 --> 00:58:19.628]  It's something like 30-something a year die in high school football.
[00:58:19.668 --> 00:58:20.488]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:20.548 --> 00:58:21.848]  High school football's rough, man.
[00:58:22.148 --> 00:58:25.809]  A lot of kids, if they don't die, they get debilitated.
[00:58:25.929 --> 00:58:34.331]  Listen, I got on the first string, and I was a little guy, and then they, when I was a freshman, sent me to varsity in a 4A school.
[00:58:34.851 --> 00:58:37.612]  And after that season, I said, I'm getting out of this.
[00:58:37.932 --> 00:58:40.213]  Yeah, there's a lot of guys who die.
[00:58:42.134 --> 00:58:49.357]  There was that one guy that committed suicide, a pro football player, really recently, he was in his 40s, and they said he had the brain of an 80-year-old man with Parkinson's.
[00:58:49.557 --> 00:58:54.219]  Oh, listen, a few times I'd have somebody run through and some giant black guy run over me and I'd be seeing stars.
[00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:55.320]  Oh, it used to be a black guy.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.401]  Well, yeah, of course it was a big black guy.
[00:58:57.601 --> 00:58:58.822]  No giant white guys run over you?
[00:58:58.842 --> 00:59:00.262]  Why would giant white guys run over me?
[00:59:00.282 --> 00:59:01.343]  The black guy's just scarier.
[00:59:02.083 --> 00:59:03.864]  Well, no, it's just, yeah, yeah, I guess.
[00:59:05.146 --> 00:59:05.766]  Well, no, that's huge.
[00:59:05.846 --> 00:59:06.987]  It tended to run over me, yeah.
[00:59:07.047 --> 00:59:08.908]  The white guys kind of let you alone?
[00:59:08.948 --> 00:59:09.748]  No, they ran over me, too.
[00:59:10.368 --> 00:59:16.130]  But I think the few times I got my bell rung, it was a black guy.
[00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:17.251]  Well, there you go.
[00:59:17.691 --> 00:59:18.471]  The black athlete.
[00:59:19.592 --> 00:59:20.252]  They're taking over.
[00:59:20.692 --> 00:59:22.333]  What's happening in Ultimate Fighting with the athletes?
[00:59:23.113 --> 00:59:27.295]  Uh, well, the UFC is, uh, right now it's a really exciting time.
[00:59:27.315 --> 00:59:28.656]  There's a lot of great fights going on.
[00:59:28.976 --> 00:59:30.816]  You know, there's a lot of great champions.
[00:59:30.956 --> 00:59:31.937]  Next weekend is huge.
[00:59:31.997 --> 00:59:33.578]  It's BJ Penn versus George St.
[00:59:33.618 --> 00:59:33.958]  Pierre.
[00:59:34.498 --> 00:59:37.059]  BJ Penn is the 155 pound champion and George St.
[00:59:37.099 --> 00:59:43.302]  Pierre is the 170 pound champion and both of them are pound for pound in the top, you know, three or four guys in the world.
[00:59:43.342 --> 00:59:44.642]  You know, they're the elite.
[00:59:44.662 --> 00:59:46.063]  So they're little and they're super powerful.
[00:59:46.223 --> 00:59:47.204]  Yeah, well George St.
[00:59:47.224 --> 00:59:55.788]  Pierre is really about 185-190 and he diets down to 170, whereas BJ really walks around at like 165 and he bulked up to go to 170.
[00:59:57.409 --> 01:00:01.811]  So they're meeting in the middle, they're meeting at 170, and I think it's just an awesome fight.
[01:00:01.871 --> 01:00:04.273]  Just two guys that are just born to do this, you know?
[01:00:04.693 --> 01:00:05.573]  It's going to be incredible.
[01:00:08.175 --> 01:00:09.556]  So you're pretty excited about that?
[01:00:09.576 --> 01:00:09.976]  You want to go?
[01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:11.370]  You wanna go?
[01:00:11.911 --> 01:00:12.911]  Wanna go to the UFC?
[01:00:12.931 --> 01:00:15.733]  Does the wife let you escape to Vegas for the weekend?
[01:00:16.634 --> 01:00:17.835]  My wife lets me do whatever I want.
[01:00:17.855 --> 01:00:18.735]  Look at you, you animal.
[01:00:19.796 --> 01:00:21.217]  Okay, I'll go to Vegas for the fight.
[01:00:21.237 --> 01:00:22.258]  If you wanna go, I'll hook it up.
[01:00:22.898 --> 01:00:23.399]  Hook it up?
[01:00:23.499 --> 01:00:23.959]  I'll hook it up.
[01:00:27.702 --> 01:00:28.342]  Oh, that's crazy.
[01:00:28.402 --> 01:00:29.923]  Jason Burmiss would kill for that.
[01:00:30.804 --> 01:00:32.525]  The fella you talk to who fills in sometimes.
[01:00:32.565 --> 01:00:34.426]  Last time you were on the air, he was in studio with us.
[01:00:34.446 --> 01:00:35.987]  He's the guy from Loose Change?
[01:00:36.127 --> 01:00:36.788]  Yeah.
[01:00:37.308 --> 01:00:38.969]  Now, what did he do with Loose Change?
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:40.881]  He did a lot of it.
[01:00:41.963 --> 01:00:44.146]  He worked on both the films.
[01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:50.535]  I know that Popular Science had a whole magazine article dedicated to... That's Hearst Publishing.
[01:00:51.477 --> 01:00:56.224]  In the Encyclopedia Britannica, next to the word Yellow Journalism is Hearst Publishing.
[01:00:56.764 --> 01:01:04.007]  And they also own A&E and they run these dramas where pot smokers are 9-11 truthers and they're killing people and are terrorists.
[01:01:04.067 --> 01:01:05.847]  I can play the clip, the latest one.
[01:01:06.047 --> 01:01:07.468]  So it's pure propaganda and they lie.
[01:01:07.488 --> 01:01:13.870]  They say, in the Popular Mechanics book, they say NORAD only intercepted one plane in all of its history.
[01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.031]  Before 9-11, that was Payne Stewart.
[01:01:16.491 --> 01:01:23.653]  And then we go and get the NORAD records and the NORAD spokesman after Payne Stewart bragging, in this year we've already intercepted 167 aircraft.
[01:01:26.013 --> 01:01:30.836]  Everybody knows, pilots know, that if your plane gets off course around a storm, they send up F-16s.
[01:01:31.316 --> 01:01:32.457]  So that's one lie.
[01:01:33.097 --> 01:01:36.199]  They also said that Building 7 fell because a fuel tank blew up.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.961]  NIST admits that isn't the case.
[01:01:40.902 --> 01:01:43.084]  Now, the Building 7 thing, you know,
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:51.609]  If you look at the way it fell, I mean, it looks like a controlled demolition, like more so even than Building 1 and Building 2.
[01:01:52.690 --> 01:02:00.520]  Is it possible that it was just a flaw in the construction, that a gigantic raging fire inside the building caused it to collapse like that?
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.641]  Is it even possible?
[01:02:01.661 --> 01:02:02.362]  No, no, they've now...
[01:02:03.363 --> 01:02:05.885]  They've given five different reasons it fell, and now the sixth.
[01:02:05.925 --> 01:02:07.546]  They said the last five, they were wrong.
[01:02:07.826 --> 01:02:08.306]  Right.
[01:02:08.566 --> 01:02:10.047]  The new one is thermal expansion.
[01:02:10.087 --> 01:02:11.808]  It's never happened anywhere in a building before.
[01:02:12.969 --> 01:02:14.150]  But that's not even the issue.
[01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:23.796]  We have all these firefighter and police videos now where they're saying, get back, they're going to blow it up, get back, and then BBC... So do you think that they set it up like when they were building it like this?
[01:02:23.916 --> 01:02:27.539]  I believe they meant to fly the Pennsylvania plane into it, and something happened.
[01:02:28.019 --> 01:02:31.042]  People tell me that the Pentagon refused orders and did shoot the plane down.
[01:02:31.302 --> 01:02:35.906]  And that they meant later in that morning to have Flight 93 fly into it, so it was already wired.
[01:02:36.126 --> 01:02:37.347]  And that was the CIA headquarters.
[01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.409]  Huh.
[01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:42.632]  So they still had to blow it up.
[01:02:43.979 --> 01:02:45.722]  So, but, this is what I don't understand.
[01:02:45.742 --> 01:02:50.228]  Do you believe that it was rigged, like, just, just prior to the attacks?
[01:02:50.629 --> 01:02:53.734]  Or do you think that it was constructed with all this explosives in it?
[01:02:53.774 --> 01:02:55.576]  Like, how do you think that... Well, we found out.
[01:02:55.616 --> 01:02:56.137]  We found out.
[01:02:56.197 --> 01:02:59.162]  I mean, if you want me to go through it, I could have you back for an hour sometime.
[01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:01.865]  And have the physicists and scientists on.
[01:03:01.905 --> 01:03:05.909]  It turns out that they did special construction.
[01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:17.842]  And that NASA, and then the very guys on NIST who are doing the cover-up, are the experts on a putty thermite that they use to discouple rockets in their stages.
[01:03:18.122 --> 01:03:18.423]  Right.
[01:03:18.443 --> 01:03:19.324]  And it's explosive.
[01:03:19.344 --> 01:03:20.425]  It cuts through things instantly.
[01:03:20.805 --> 01:03:25.148]  But they had to get through to the frame of the building to install the stuff, right?
[01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:30.592]  In 1999, they did a remodel and added new fireproofing and used a special company connected to the group.
[01:03:31.213 --> 01:03:35.336]  So they set this up from 1999 and they waited until... Stay there, stay there, here we go.
[01:03:35.356 --> 01:03:45.383]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:03:45.863 --> 01:03:46.903]  Garden in a can.
[01:03:47.284 --> 01:03:50.845]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[01:03:51.425 --> 01:03:53.186]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.

[01:04:34.315 --> 01:04:40.700]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.061]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:04:43.722 --> 01:04:44.742]  But who is the enemy?
[01:04:45.263 --> 01:04:45.783]  Bin Laden.
[01:04:46.063 --> 01:04:46.924]  This is his ammo.
[01:04:46.964 --> 01:04:48.345]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:04:48.365 --> 01:04:50.106]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:04:50.426 --> 01:04:57.191]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:04:57.571 --> 01:04:58.012]  Some U.S.
[01:04:58.072 --> 01:05:03.696]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:05:04.396 --> 01:05:07.897]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:10.698]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

[01:07:00.375 --> 01:07:05.257]  Hey, Joe Rogan, you were just saying, only in Austin, Texas would you have Alex Jones as the police chief.
[01:07:05.297 --> 01:07:06.697]  Yeah, well, the police chief was saying that.
[01:07:06.737 --> 01:07:07.777]  He was doing impressions of you.
[01:07:07.797 --> 01:07:08.538]  It's hilarious.
[01:07:08.698 --> 01:07:10.138]  He's going, one day closer to victory!
[01:07:11.299 --> 01:07:12.179]  I've got the documents!
[01:07:12.745 --> 01:07:13.705]  The police team's out there.
[01:07:13.966 --> 01:07:15.386]  I noticed he brought bodyguards, though.
[01:07:15.706 --> 01:07:16.587]  He's a little nervous of you.
[01:07:16.927 --> 01:07:17.607]  Nervous of you?
[01:07:17.807 --> 01:07:18.167]  What?
[01:07:18.608 --> 01:07:20.408]  He knows you're the ultimate fighting man.
[01:07:20.528 --> 01:07:21.669]  I'm just a talker.
[01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:22.869]  I just talk.
[01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:24.910]  You know, Joe, I know people that know you.
[01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:25.951]  You actually go to the gym.
[01:07:25.971 --> 01:07:28.452]  You get into big stuff with big guys.
[01:07:28.472 --> 01:07:29.793]  You actually train with the police, actually.
[01:07:29.813 --> 01:07:30.673]  You said a lot of cops.
[01:07:30.953 --> 01:07:31.514]  Yeah.
[01:07:31.754 --> 01:07:34.396]  And haven't you won some awards?
[01:07:34.556 --> 01:07:39.401]  When I was younger, yeah, I won a lot of Taekwondo tournaments and kickboxing fights.
[01:07:39.601 --> 01:07:41.222]  But yeah, I haven't done that in a long time.
[01:07:41.242 --> 01:07:43.825]  I haven't competed in several decades.
[01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:46.447]  And I had Chuck Norris on and I said, who would win between you and Bruce Lee?
[01:07:46.467 --> 01:07:48.689]  And he basically said, Bruce Lee was just an actor.
[01:07:49.209 --> 01:07:49.750]  I'm a champion.
[01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:50.571]  What do you think would happen?
[01:07:50.771 --> 01:07:53.313]  Yeah, that's kind of true.
[01:07:53.433 --> 01:07:54.915]  I had a bet on Chuck back in the day.
[01:07:55.035 --> 01:07:55.835]  Chuck was a badass.
[01:07:56.556 --> 01:07:56.776]  That was a
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:18.341]  No, I don't.
[01:08:36.664 --> 01:08:40.126]  Hey guys, rotate the camera around so we can see the police chief in there.
[01:08:40.146 --> 01:08:44.970]  Let's get some of the guys out of the studio first so we have room.
[01:08:45.690 --> 01:08:49.593]  Let's rotate the camera around so we can see the police chief in there.
[01:08:50.333 --> 01:08:51.434]  No, this is the camera to rotate.
[01:08:51.454 --> 01:08:55.337]  If you rotate camera two... Alex is worried they're going to put him in a FEMA camp.
[01:08:56.897 --> 01:08:59.259]  If you put him in a FEMA camp, could it please be air-conditioned?
[01:09:00.019 --> 01:09:00.920]  Here, rotate it around.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:01.620]  Oh, I asked him.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:02.781]  Listen, I asked him last time.
[01:09:02.801 --> 01:09:09.425]  I said, the feds said... Look, I've got a woman going to a FEMA camp, charged under the Patriot Act, L.A.
[01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:11.906]  Times, for spilling a Bloody Mary on a plane.
[01:09:11.926 --> 01:09:13.327]  I've said this to you before and I'm going to say it again.
[01:09:13.387 --> 01:09:15.569]  Maybe that chick was a douchebag.
[01:09:16.169 --> 01:09:17.250]  She deserves to go to the FEMA camp!
[01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:17.770]  Isn't that possible?
[01:09:18.151 --> 01:09:18.891]  Isn't that possible?
[01:09:18.911 --> 01:09:33.622]  Isn't that possible that chick was a giant pain in the ass, and she was a pain in the ass to the flight attendants, then she was a pain in the ass to the cops that talked to her when she got off, maybe she screams and yells, maybe she likes to curse at people, maybe she can't control her temper, maybe she should be locked up, maybe she's just a pain in the ass.
[01:09:33.642 --> 01:09:36.905]  She should be charged outside the Bill of Rights under the Patriot Act.
[01:09:37.165 --> 01:09:37.905]  Maybe.
[01:09:38.306 --> 01:09:39.046]  Maybe her.
[01:09:39.126 --> 01:09:40.206]  Maybe just that one lady.
[01:09:40.266 --> 01:09:41.967]  Look at you groveling to the police!
[01:09:42.147 --> 01:09:43.708]  It's true, I'm licking their boots, Alex Jones!
[01:09:43.728 --> 01:09:45.008]  You turned me over to them!
[01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:49.590]  Listen, it's like... I'm doing it for the... I want the upper floor in the FEMA camp.
[01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:51.131]  Hey, let me tell you what... I want the view.
[01:09:51.551 --> 01:09:52.391]  It's like O'Brien.
[01:09:52.411 --> 01:09:57.053]  Winston thinks O'Brien's his friend, and when he's in the FEMA camp jail... Who's O'Brien and who's Winston?
[01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:58.474]  The guy that tortures him in 1984.
[01:09:59.034 --> 01:10:01.615]  O'Brien walks in and he says, they got you too?
[01:10:01.675 --> 01:10:03.076]  And he said, they got me a long time ago.
[01:10:04.036 --> 01:10:04.397]  Oh, I see.
[01:10:04.437 --> 01:10:05.838]  And he's the guy that's going to torture Winston.
[01:10:05.858 --> 01:10:07.119]  Well, that's what everybody's worried about, right?
[01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:07.719]  And that's what this is!
[01:10:08.039 --> 01:10:08.900]  Look, O'Brien!
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.082]  Here, rotate that camera around right there.
[01:10:11.102 --> 01:10:11.522]  Camera three.
[01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:13.063]  He's showing that he's going to lock you up.
[01:10:13.103 --> 01:10:14.064]  There's O'Brien.
[01:10:14.404 --> 01:10:16.326]  There's O'Brien inside there right now.
[01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:24.912]  See, now this has been my take always on police officers and soldiers, and if you want to start blaming the people that are running this world, that's one thing.
[01:10:25.273 --> 01:10:27.875]  But cops aren't getting paid for that.
[01:10:27.935 --> 01:10:29.836]  They're not the ones that are profiting off of it.
[01:10:29.896 --> 01:10:32.058]  And narcotics officers never plant drugs on people.
[01:10:32.398 --> 01:10:36.383]  Well, I think there's certainly a lot of shady stuff that goes on with narcs.
[01:10:37.304 --> 01:10:37.745]  For sure.
[01:10:37.765 --> 01:10:45.694]  Well, they're operating in a shady world, and they're watching these young black kids drive around in $150,000 Mercedes' when they can't even pay their rent.
[01:10:46.615 --> 01:10:48.257]  So put them in a FEMA camp, too!
[01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.879]  Put FEMA camps, everybody.
[01:10:50.794 --> 01:10:52.495]  As long as we get a nice air-conditioned building.
[01:10:52.535 --> 01:10:54.217]  Hell, we don't need the Bill of Rights.
[01:10:54.237 --> 01:10:58.200]  Hell, it's good they charged her with a Patriot Act and thousands of others in marijuana cases.
[01:10:58.581 --> 01:10:58.961]  She might.
[01:10:59.201 --> 01:11:01.263]  Maybe if she was your neighbor, you would hate that lady.
[01:11:01.303 --> 01:11:07.028]  Wait, so put the marijuana smokers, use the Patriot Act on the marijuana smokers?
[01:11:07.048 --> 01:11:08.028]  They spill everything.
[01:11:08.089 --> 01:11:09.890]  Put them in the FEMA camp.
[01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.571]  They spill everything.
[01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:14.033]  I'm Alex Jones, he's Joe Rogan.
[01:11:14.054 --> 01:11:14.534]  Stay with us.
[01:11:15.014 --> 01:11:18.017]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:11:26.755 --> 01:11:31.479]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:11:31.499 --> 01:11:34.242]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:11:34.462 --> 01:11:37.324]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:11:37.505 --> 01:11:42.209]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:11:42.449 --> 01:11:43.350]  If you simply prepare.
[01:11:43.571 --> 01:11:46.495]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:11:46.815 --> 01:11:53.725]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:11:53.845 --> 01:11:56.949]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:12:14.241 --> 01:12:16.062]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:12:27.842 --> 01:12:29.743]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:12:30.243 --> 01:12:33.004]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:12:54.057 --> 01:12:57.900]  I'm surrounded by Joe Rogan, the police bootlicker.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:58.720]  Hey, fella.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.601]  I'm just joking.
[01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:00.482]  Don't put me in a stranglehold.
[01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:02.203]  I don't know how to counter your jiu-jitsu.
[01:13:02.523 --> 01:13:03.104]  We're friends.
[01:13:03.524 --> 01:13:04.585]  I know, I'm joking.
[01:13:04.605 --> 01:13:04.825]  We're not.
[01:13:04.845 --> 01:13:05.525]  I'm just teasing you.
[01:13:05.705 --> 01:13:07.286]  Hey, I'm going to come to the Friday Show.
[01:13:07.827 --> 01:13:09.548]  Alex Jones, Friday Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:09.868 --> 01:13:13.731]  Now, they're saying on their website some of the events are sold out.
[01:13:13.751 --> 01:13:15.192]  They're doing two shows tomorrow.
[01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:16.153]  Two shows Saturday?
[01:13:16.755 --> 01:13:17.736]  Two shows Saturday.
[01:13:17.856 --> 01:13:19.958]  One tonight, two shows tomorrow, two shows Saturday.
[01:13:20.018 --> 01:13:22.060]  And so people need to go to the website or call the number?
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:28.967]  Yeah, the website says everything is sold out, but if you go to the booth like, you know, tonight or today, you might be able to buy a few tickets.
[01:13:28.987 --> 01:13:33.712]  I was about to say, whenever... They save a few, they put a few aside, so there's a couple that are available.
[01:13:33.752 --> 01:13:34.993]  Hey, you want to offer the police chief one?
[01:13:35.013 --> 01:13:35.654]  Maybe he can go with us?
[01:13:35.674 --> 01:13:36.174]  Yeah, that's good.
[01:13:36.435 --> 01:13:37.696]  Especially when I start talking about pot.
[01:13:38.717 --> 01:13:39.438]  I'm set up close.
[01:13:41.212 --> 01:13:44.535]  But I mean, seriously, they're putting people with pot charging them with terrorism.
[01:13:44.555 --> 01:13:45.035]  Are you for that?
[01:13:45.856 --> 01:13:47.237]  Uh, no, I'm not for that, obviously.
[01:13:47.377 --> 01:13:48.117]  Where's that?
[01:13:48.438 --> 01:13:49.498]  Who's charging who with terrorism?
[01:13:49.518 --> 01:13:49.999]  I can pull it up.
[01:13:50.019 --> 01:13:52.020]  Patriot Act being used in marijuana cases.
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:52.260]  Google it.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:52.801]  It's hilarious.
[01:13:53.602 --> 01:13:55.863]  And they don't get their Bill of Rights under it.
[01:13:55.883 --> 01:13:57.605]  It was meant for hardcore al-Qaeda.
[01:13:58.065 --> 01:13:58.725]  They're definitely right.
[01:13:58.745 --> 01:13:59.926]  There's some terrorism going on.
[01:14:00.867 --> 01:14:01.888]  If you get really good weed...
[01:14:02.654 --> 01:14:05.138]  You get really good weed and you eat it like you're really good pot brownie?
[01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:07.062]  That's just, that is like an act of terrorism.
[01:14:07.763 --> 01:14:09.606]  That scares the hell out of you.
[01:14:09.626 --> 01:14:11.149]  You ever have a really good pot brownie?
[01:14:11.169 --> 01:14:12.210]  You get terrified.
[01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:14.174]  You want to curl up in a fetal position and just cry.
[01:14:15.486 --> 01:14:16.066]  It's terrorism.
[01:14:16.146 --> 01:14:17.867]  Joe, this has been one insane transmission.
[01:14:19.328 --> 01:14:21.109]  And we found out you like Ron Paul.
[01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:22.530]  Well, you know what?
[01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:23.731]  I've been pretty vocal about that.
[01:14:24.972 --> 01:14:29.114]  I think anybody who's looking at the system, there's no way to look at it and say, well, this is a mess.
[01:14:29.174 --> 01:14:30.215]  This needs to be revamped.
[01:14:30.395 --> 01:14:36.359]  And he was the only one that was offering a real radical restructuring of our government.
[01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:43.243]  And staying out of other people's business, not being the policeman for the world, not getting involved in all their BS.
[01:14:43.703 --> 01:14:47.546]  By the way, Joe, there's another reason you're so successful in all the media you do.
[01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:48.246]  You're a hard-working guy.
[01:14:48.266 --> 01:14:55.912]  You got in late last night, you had three hours sleep, you did a couple hours at KLBJ this morning, and now you're in studio here, and you're finally gonna get some sleep now before the show.
[01:14:55.932 --> 01:14:57.553]  Well, I'm doing it for you because you're my friend.
[01:14:57.573 --> 01:14:59.815]  I mean, you know, I've always enjoyed hanging out with you.
[01:14:59.875 --> 01:15:03.758]  You're a funny guy, and I think you do a great service.
[01:15:03.918 --> 01:15:04.698]  Well, you're my friend.
[01:15:04.738 --> 01:15:05.839]  People think that you're crazy.
[01:15:05.939 --> 01:15:09.582]  I think there's a lot of stuff that you say that's just irrefutable, and people need to look at that.
[01:15:09.642 --> 01:15:10.763]  Well, I appreciate you, Joe.
[01:15:10.783 --> 01:15:17.491]  In the ten years I've known you, it's always... We'll have Walker canes next week.
[01:15:17.531 --> 01:15:18.372]  That's on the way, bro.
[01:15:20.174 --> 01:15:22.196]  Then we're going to be in silver spacesuits as old men.
[01:15:22.216 --> 01:15:22.977]  You think so?
[01:15:23.117 --> 01:15:24.098]  Yeah, like little jetpacks.
[01:15:24.599 --> 01:15:25.200]  We're good to go.
[01:15:42.959 --> 01:15:46.742]  I don't smoke pot, but I'm for decriminalization.
[01:15:47.102 --> 01:15:49.244]  Because 87% of drug users only use it.
[01:15:49.284 --> 01:15:50.304]  We need to empty the prisons out.
[01:15:50.324 --> 01:15:51.886]  Well, not only that, how about this?
[01:15:51.946 --> 01:15:54.648]  How about all you're doing is, it's just an experience.
[01:15:55.168 --> 01:15:56.409]  You're not hurting anyone else.
[01:15:56.690 --> 01:16:01.193]  And who is one person to tell you what you can and can't experience?
[01:16:01.433 --> 01:16:04.516]  The argument that you're saving people from it is complete, total nonsense.
[01:16:04.736 --> 01:16:11.542]  There hasn't been a study ever done that shows that there's some sort of a negative health effect, especially to rational use of marijuana.
[01:16:12.142 --> 01:16:17.364]  Well, we know that cigarettes kill millions a year.
[01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:20.305]  Caffeine kills thousands of people every year.
[01:16:20.385 --> 01:16:21.965]  So does aspirin.
[01:16:22.025 --> 01:16:24.786]  Cigarettes kill 400,000 in this country every year.
[01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:30.488]  Alcohol kills 90,000 to 100,000 just of deaths of drinking themselves to death.
[01:16:30.948 --> 01:16:31.809]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:16:31.849 --> 01:16:33.651]  Marijuana zero, ever.
[01:16:34.151 --> 01:16:41.578]  But because of the fact that it's been demonized with propaganda from William Randolph Hearst and Harry Anslinger in the 30s up until today.
[01:16:41.618 --> 01:16:43.259]  William Randolph Hearst, that's Hearst Publishing.
[01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:44.020]  Exactly.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:52.267]  The reason why, people don't understand, the reason why marijuana was initially made illegal was not because of the psychoactive effects of the plants, it was completely an economic issue.
[01:16:52.287 --> 01:16:57.012]  Dow Chemical didn't want people to wear polyester, not the hemp clothes.
[01:16:57.312 --> 01:17:00.736]  Temp is a far more durable fiber than cotton.
[01:17:00.756 --> 01:17:02.298]  And unlike cotton, it grows everywhere.
[01:17:02.479 --> 01:17:02.999]  Exactly.
[01:17:03.039 --> 01:17:04.001]  And it's renewable.
[01:17:04.301 --> 01:17:06.404]  It's much more renewable than trees are.
[01:17:06.424 --> 01:17:11.771]  You can make paper out of it far easier and restore the area in a few months' time.
[01:17:12.051 --> 01:17:13.293]  You have plants growing there again.
[01:17:13.473 --> 01:17:14.473]  You come into Austin once a year?
[01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:15.554]  I come in once a year.
[01:17:15.574 --> 01:17:17.534]  We've got to have you back in next time and I'm going to come see you.
[01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:17.734]  I will.
[01:17:18.014 --> 01:17:18.895]  I'm going to come see you.
[01:17:18.975 --> 01:17:19.795]  Friday night, buddy.
[01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:20.455]  Late show.
[01:17:20.475 --> 01:17:22.696]  If you want to go to the Friday night late show, you can sneak in.
[01:17:23.156 --> 01:17:27.457]  Alex Jones will be there, ladies and gentlemen, and we will be one step closer to victory.
[01:17:27.657 --> 01:17:29.998]  We have the documents to prove it.
[01:17:30.158 --> 01:17:33.179]  Alright, we'll be right back with the Austin Police Chief, Mr. Femacamp.
[01:17:33.339 --> 01:17:33.779]  Stay with us.
[01:17:35.225 --> 01:17:37.487]  Right now the world is a scary place.
[01:17:37.728 --> 01:17:42.913]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[01:17:43.153 --> 01:17:47.557]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[01:17:47.757 --> 01:17:50.440]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:18:00.410]  The first line of defense kit includes Nutri-Immune and Nutri-Defense, providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry, and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:09.119]  Also included, the Nano-Mask Nano-Particular antiviral masks with replacement filters, providing supreme viral protection from airborne pathogens.
[01:18:09.419 --> 01:18:11.041]  And, the first line of defense wipes,
[01:18:11.201 --> 01:18:11.702]  I think so.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:41.503]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:43.864]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:18:44.525 --> 01:18:45.545]  But who is the enemy?
[01:18:46.066 --> 01:18:46.566]  Bin Laden.
[01:18:46.866 --> 01:18:47.786]  This is his ammo.
[01:18:47.826 --> 01:18:49.227]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:18:49.247 --> 01:18:50.908]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:18:51.228 --> 01:18:57.992]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:18:58.372 --> 01:18:58.832]  Some U.S.
[01:18:58.872 --> 01:19:04.495]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:19:05.195 --> 01:19:08.736]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:18.940]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:19.921]  Fabled enemies.
[01:19:20.401 --> 01:19:27.683]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:31.505]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:19:35.262 --> 01:19:38.645]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:19:38.785 --> 01:19:44.010]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:48.974]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:19:49.354 --> 01:20:00.384]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:20:00.864 --> 01:20:06.405]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:20:06.645 --> 01:20:12.706]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:20:12.906 --> 01:20:13.547]  What about you?
[01:20:13.947 --> 01:20:19.968]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:20:39.997 --> 01:20:40.658]  Big Brother.
[01:20:41.298 --> 01:20:42.359]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:43.079 --> 01:20:44.180]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:45.641]  You want answers?
[01:20:46.422 --> 01:20:47.922]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:47.983 --> 01:20:51.605]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:52.145 --> 01:20:54.487]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:20:55.379 --> 01:20:56.220]  Alex Jones.
[01:21:06.547 --> 01:21:10.189]  We have Chief Art Acevedo, the Austin Police Chief here.
[01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:12.291]  And he does have backup with him.
[01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:13.351]  They do have syringes.
[01:21:13.391 --> 01:21:15.913]  They want to draw blood from the entire office.
[01:21:16.073 --> 01:21:17.614]  Actually, for you, we want a urine sample.
[01:21:18.395 --> 01:21:18.715]  You do?
[01:21:18.775 --> 01:21:19.516]  You want a urine sample?
[01:21:19.536 --> 01:21:19.856]  Yes, we do.
[01:21:20.836 --> 01:21:22.298]  In a cup, so I don't get any ideas.
[01:21:22.858 --> 01:21:23.279]  Alright.
[01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:27.503]  Well, again, ladies and gentlemen, there's the police chief, live on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:28.464 --> 01:21:29.545]  You just styled your hair.
[01:21:29.745 --> 01:21:31.026]  I have a bad haircut today.
[01:21:31.046 --> 01:21:33.629]  No, no, no, but last time you were in here on a break, I was combing my hair.
[01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.830]  You made fun of me.
[01:21:35.311 --> 01:21:35.371]  Ah!
[01:21:36.257 --> 01:21:37.298]  Well, we're good looking guys.
[01:21:37.338 --> 01:21:39.701]  We want to make sure we're looking good for your audience.
[01:21:39.841 --> 01:21:41.624]  How did you like meeting Joe Rogan?
[01:21:41.704 --> 01:21:42.445]  He's a good man.
[01:21:42.785 --> 01:21:46.229]  Actually, it was nice talking to him about John McCarthy.
[01:21:46.249 --> 01:21:48.372]  He used to be the ref there for the UFC.
[01:21:48.392 --> 01:21:49.273]  He's a good friend of mine.
[01:21:49.293 --> 01:21:50.174]  I've known him for many years.
[01:21:51.116 --> 01:21:52.517]  Catching up on what's going on with him, too.
[01:21:52.537 --> 01:21:53.579]  So you're a UFC fan?
[01:21:54.341 --> 01:21:58.208]  Yeah, yeah, it's a great, you know, it's warriors, man.
[01:21:58.248 --> 01:22:05.260]  We come from a warrior culture and it's good to see guys fight and actually, I don't think it's as vicious as people think, try to make it out to be.
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.302]  There are some rules.
[01:22:06.502 --> 01:22:08.205]  Well, less folks die in this than in boxing.
[01:22:08.479 --> 01:22:09.119]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.860]  I think it's safer.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.722]  But historically, it's a sign of a society in decline when gladiatorial events become popular.
[01:22:16.502 --> 01:22:19.823]  Well, I think they've been popular with humanity throughout our history.
[01:22:20.684 --> 01:22:25.105]  So I don't know if it's a sign, but if it's a bad sign, we're in trouble because we've been doing it forever.
[01:22:25.125 --> 01:22:30.807]  There was a famous case in Miami where the cop union brought in two big fighters to fight each other.
[01:22:32.808 --> 01:22:35.330]  Did you ever hear about that case?
[01:22:35.530 --> 01:22:35.790]  No.
[01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:38.732]  Alex, I don't have the network of information that you have.
[01:22:38.772 --> 01:22:41.994]  You seem to be more in tune with what's going on in the world than some other folks.
[01:22:42.014 --> 01:22:42.694]  I don't know about that.
[01:22:42.934 --> 01:22:47.077]  Hey, everybody wants to hear this legendary imitation you do around town and do it out in the hall.
[01:22:47.437 --> 01:22:49.258]  Give us an Alex Jones imitation, Chief.
[01:22:49.819 --> 01:22:55.002]  You know, I remember when I asked you, hey, if you actually believed half the stuff you say, and you go, I can prove it all, Chief!
[01:22:55.082 --> 01:22:55.842]  I can prove it all!
[01:22:56.243 --> 01:22:58.044]  And, you know, tell me more!
[01:22:58.834 --> 01:22:59.455]  You're getting in my head!
[01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:00.616]  You're co-opting me, Chief!
[01:23:00.876 --> 01:23:01.577]  That's hilarious.
[01:23:02.758 --> 01:23:03.459]  I love you, though, man.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:09.486]  You're a great person that questions things, and that's not a bad thing.
[01:23:09.546 --> 01:23:18.495]  There's a reason we have a First Amendment of the Constitution and a free press, and I'm absolutely an advocate for free press, and that's why I'm here.
[01:23:18.515 --> 01:23:19.717]  I don't have nothing to hide.
[01:23:20.137 --> 01:23:22.059]  Except that needle you got for sucking blood.
[01:23:22.099 --> 01:23:31.266]  You know, hey, it's about safety, and I know that some folks, there's a guy that came on your show, he's the vampire cop, and... You know about everything!
[01:23:31.286 --> 01:23:32.868]  Are you listening to the show, monitoring?
[01:23:32.928 --> 01:23:33.048]  I do!
[01:23:33.068 --> 01:23:37.331]  I listen to your show, I've watched some of your DVDs, and... Oh my god, are their FEMA camps ready?
[01:23:37.531 --> 01:23:41.335]  Yeah, your FEMA camp's ready, we've got a nice bed for you, satin sheets, just for you.
[01:23:42.035 --> 01:23:42.956]  Or did you want a water bed?
[01:23:43.636 --> 01:23:48.961]  Again, Austin Police Chief, you are more popular than some of the last police chiefs, I think that's because you are reaching out to the community.
[01:23:49.545 --> 01:23:50.966]  Well, I think that we're transparent.
[01:23:52.307 --> 01:23:55.309]  One of the organizational philosophies that I have is that you have to be transparent.
[01:23:55.349 --> 01:23:59.992]  Americans question government, they don't trust their government, and I think that's a good thing.
[01:24:00.393 --> 01:24:03.555]  Transparency breeds trust, and trust breeds cooperation.
[01:24:03.615 --> 01:24:08.878]  I think that the more that people trust us and know what we're doing, the better off we're all going to be as Americans.
[01:24:09.079 --> 01:24:12.961]  Hey, during the break, you were telling me a story, but we got cut off by having to go on air.
[01:24:13.922 --> 01:24:18.045]  You said you loved seeing that Geraldo Rivera confrontation.
[01:24:19.099 --> 01:24:31.523]  It was very entertaining because I know you and Geraldo was doing his thing and here comes Alex Jones and we were going into the office going hey Alex is at it at the RNC and it was fun to watch.
[01:24:33.604 --> 01:24:35.685]  And then I got arrested, even though we had a permit.
[01:24:35.725 --> 01:24:36.405]  You did get arrested?
[01:24:36.425 --> 01:24:38.386]  Yes, for a non-authorized sound device.
[01:24:39.667 --> 01:24:43.008]  But then the police had let me go because people surrounding the police station were protesting.
[01:24:43.028 --> 01:24:43.409]  Yeah.
[01:24:44.349 --> 01:24:45.610]  And it's all on video.
[01:24:46.110 --> 01:24:46.890]  I'll give you a copy of it.
[01:24:47.971 --> 01:24:54.494]  And to make a long story short, they then pointed out that the ticket was a $200 fine and I shouldn't have been arrested.
[01:24:55.645 --> 01:24:56.666]  And so they let me go.
[01:24:56.686 --> 01:24:58.888]  So it should have been just a sight and release situation?
[01:24:59.408 --> 01:25:00.149]  Yes, I did nothing.
[01:25:00.969 --> 01:25:03.091]  They said, come over here, you're not supposed to use that, you have a permit for that.
[01:25:03.111 --> 01:25:03.531]  And I said, no.
[01:25:03.551 --> 01:25:04.972]  And they said, put him in cuffs.
[01:25:05.673 --> 01:25:08.115]  I guess they wanted to incite the crowd of 300 screaming people.
[01:25:08.655 --> 01:25:09.856]  And then they drug me off.
[01:25:09.996 --> 01:25:13.219]  But let me tell you, Austin police are a little nicer on average than the New York police.
[01:25:13.239 --> 01:25:18.162]  Have you ever been in civilian clothes and had them call you scum and stuff?
[01:25:18.242 --> 01:25:18.442]  No.
[01:25:18.643 --> 01:25:23.006]  I try not to antagonize police officers when I'm off duty.
[01:25:23.246 --> 01:25:24.327]  But I don't mean antagonize.
[01:25:25.068 --> 01:25:31.095]  Well, you know, you start blowing into their ear with a bullhorn five feet away, that might be a little... That isn't what happened!
[01:25:31.236 --> 01:25:31.936]  I don't know if it is!
[01:25:31.956 --> 01:25:32.837]  Frame up!
[01:25:32.857 --> 01:25:33.759]  Frame up!
[01:25:33.859 --> 01:25:35.340]  I didn't say that's what happened.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.241]  I'm just giving an example.
[01:25:36.261 --> 01:25:37.343]  You just implanted that idea.
[01:25:37.503 --> 01:25:38.104]  Antagonistic.
[01:25:38.504 --> 01:25:43.227]  Let's talk about what you're doing in Austin, but I wanted to bring this up, because last time I didn't have the articles in front of me.
[01:25:43.667 --> 01:25:56.135]  And this woman, for yelling on the plane, she was charged under the Patriot Act as a terrorist, and then was held without bail and wasn't allowed to have a lawyer under the Terrorism Act, Section 802.
[01:25:57.416 --> 01:25:57.736]  Right there.
[01:25:58.376 --> 01:26:00.097]  I mean, is that a good use of the Patriot Act?
[01:26:00.117 --> 01:26:02.539]  They promised it wasn't going to be used except for Al Qaeda.
[01:26:02.719 --> 01:26:16.003]  You know, I haven't seen this charge, but I will tell you that I think that the federal government takes disrupting flights and being disruptive in airlines much more seriously than they used to.
[01:26:16.023 --> 01:26:20.465]  But do they charge you under terrorism provisions that then take a lot of your rights away in court?
[01:26:21.025 --> 01:26:21.805]  Not that I'm aware of.
[01:26:22.106 --> 01:26:22.966]  No, it's right here.
[01:26:23.286 --> 01:26:24.726]  But I don't have my reading glasses.
[01:26:24.906 --> 01:26:26.107]  Here, let me just read it to you.
[01:26:27.483 --> 01:26:35.429]  It says the incident aboard the Frontier flight ultimately led to Freeman's arrest and conviction for a federal felony defined as an act of terrorism under the Patriot Act.
[01:26:35.529 --> 01:26:37.030]  And she was tried under the Patriot Act.
[01:26:37.791 --> 01:26:41.594]  And it says here that she yelled at the flight attendant.
[01:26:41.774 --> 01:26:49.360]  Yeah, well I don't know what the intent was from the Patriot Act, but it doesn't ring like that's what we had in mind.
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:54.464]  Well, I mean, you've spoken out against Fidel Castro, who's about to kick it, and you know, you escaped that.
[01:26:54.504 --> 01:26:55.545]  I mean, does that not sound like
[01:26:56.721 --> 01:26:57.081]  Cuba?
[01:26:57.862 --> 01:27:00.664]  Well, I don't know about, like I said, what was the penalty?
[01:27:00.704 --> 01:27:01.385]  Does it say on there?
[01:27:02.225 --> 01:27:04.067]  Uh, yeah, it's 10 years in prison.
[01:27:05.008 --> 01:27:05.748]  I mean, it goes on.
[01:27:05.808 --> 01:27:08.610]  It says for people only raising their voice, not even cussing.
[01:27:09.911 --> 01:27:10.532]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:11.653]  I'm not familiar with that case.
[01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:17.297]  I think you'd have to take a look at the... Remember, sometimes when you read news reports, they may not have all the information.
[01:27:17.317 --> 01:27:17.677]  No, no, no, no.
[01:27:17.718 --> 01:27:19.979]  Listen, before anybody talked about this, I read Section 802 of H.R.
[01:27:19.999 --> 01:27:20.360]  3162 past October 27, 2001.
[01:27:23.729 --> 01:27:29.754]  And it said, Section 802, any action that endangers human life, that's a violation of any federal or state law, is hereby an act of terrorism.
[01:27:30.215 --> 01:27:31.896]  And it changed the old definition of the U.S.
[01:27:31.936 --> 01:27:32.176]  Code.
[01:27:32.497 --> 01:27:43.006]  And then it says you don't get due process, you don't get lawyers, we can spy on your lawyers, we can strip you of your citizenship, take you to Guantanamo Bay, and then use strong interrogation methods, which is a renamed torture.
[01:27:43.406 --> 01:27:49.167]  And then try you secretly before a tribunal, and if the president doesn't like the tribunal's response, then you would still be executed in secret.
[01:27:49.447 --> 01:27:54.148]  That's also nexuses in with the John Moore Defense Authorization Act and the Military Commissions Act.
[01:27:54.548 --> 01:28:00.109]  But right here it says, Freeman is one of at least 200 people on flights who have been convicted under the amended law.
[01:28:00.129 --> 01:28:04.690]  In most of these cases, there was no evidence that the passengers attempted to hijack the airplane or physically attack any of the flight crew.
[01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:09.011]  Many have simply involved raising voices, foul language, and drunken behavior.
[01:28:10.171 --> 01:28:10.752]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:28:10.812 --> 01:28:12.794]  I'm not familiar with the case, so I can't really comment on it.
[01:28:12.814 --> 01:28:16.619]  But I will say that there's a new administration in D.C.
[01:28:16.879 --> 01:28:24.108]  and I'm sure that they're looking at presidential directives of the past and different laws, and they may go in a different direction.
[01:28:25.069 --> 01:28:26.991]  I mean, this sounds like what the founders got mad at in 1776.
[01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:31.608]  Well, based on what you're saying, potentially, yeah.
[01:28:31.908 --> 01:28:32.849]  Were the Founders evil?
[01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:43.718]  You know, I didn't know them, so I can't... No, but I mean, I have FBI on video in FEMA teaching police in the classified training that a police officer got us in Kansas City.
[01:28:43.998 --> 01:28:45.019]  The Founding Fathers were bad.
[01:28:46.125 --> 01:28:50.387]  You know what, I've been a cop for 22 years and I can't say I've ever heard that.
[01:28:50.967 --> 01:28:58.710]  And I would have a problem with somebody teaching my cops at the founding fathers of this country that I think framed an outstanding constitution.
[01:28:59.690 --> 01:29:08.554]  The spirit, which I'm thinking is a living document, that is a constitution is something that I think I've taken an oath to die for if I had to.
[01:29:10.245 --> 01:29:12.506]  Alright, and I appreciate you presenting yourself for interrogation.
[01:29:12.546 --> 01:29:18.168]  I'd like you to be able to talk about some of the... Remember, you do have to drive out of here.
[01:29:18.188 --> 01:29:18.868]  No, I'm kidding.
[01:29:18.988 --> 01:29:20.048]  Oh yeah, you are, huh?
[01:29:20.068 --> 01:29:20.989]  A little double meaning.
[01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:27.891]  We are neighbors, too.
[01:29:27.951 --> 01:29:28.451]  Don't forget.
[01:29:28.471 --> 01:29:30.852]  He got a little aggressive last time after the show.
[01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:31.952]  Why did I get aggressive?
[01:29:31.972 --> 01:29:33.173]  You grabbed me by the arm.
[01:29:34.233 --> 01:29:37.034]  And squeezed it, and you said, you said, you really believe this stuff?
[01:29:37.054 --> 01:29:37.535]  And I said, yes.
[01:29:37.575 --> 01:29:39.195]  No, that's not what you said.
[01:29:39.395 --> 01:29:40.556]  You said, I can prove it all, Chief!
[01:29:40.636 --> 01:29:41.296]  I can prove it all!
[01:29:41.856 --> 01:29:44.497]  Then you started accusing me of trying to co-opt you.
[01:29:44.978 --> 01:29:45.438]  You're co-opting!
[01:29:45.458 --> 01:29:46.118]  This guy's good!
[01:29:46.138 --> 01:29:47.078]  This guy's good!
[01:29:47.139 --> 01:29:48.019]  You'll see him again!
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:50.240]  We are.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:52.621]  We're going to see you as the head of the Global FEMA Command.
[01:29:53.281 --> 01:29:53.881]  I don't think so.
[01:29:54.562 --> 01:29:56.342]  You'll wear a huge black leather uniform.
[01:29:57.223 --> 01:29:57.563]  Uh, no.
[01:29:57.803 --> 01:29:58.043]  Never.
[01:29:58.383 --> 01:29:59.624]  With, like, huge steel high heels.
[01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:00.524]  Oh, look at these uniforms.
[01:30:00.544 --> 01:30:01.164]  They're friendly.
[01:30:01.364 --> 01:30:02.045]  They're professional.
[01:30:04.233 --> 01:30:13.922]  I really think that we in Austin, I can only speak for Austin, I can't speak for any other entity, but we're about as transparent as we've been, and I think it's paying dividends.
[01:30:14.002 --> 01:30:17.205]  I think the community sees us in a different light, and that's not a bad thing for the business.
[01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:20.208]  What I like is the black and whites, because when I'm speeding I can see them further away.
[01:30:20.508 --> 01:30:21.910]  You see, and then some people don't like them.
[01:30:22.728 --> 01:30:24.308]  Well, I like it because I can see it further away.
[01:30:24.328 --> 01:30:25.949]  The old white ones were hard for me to see.
[01:30:26.469 --> 01:30:27.449]  Especially when everything's white.
[01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:29.029]  All the cars are white here.
[01:30:29.249 --> 01:30:31.630]  The reason that we want to go to Buffalo... Visibility.
[01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:32.470]  High visibility.
[01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:35.290]  Look, my job is to try to deter crime.
[01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:37.531]  I mean, once crime's occurred, we've already failed.
[01:30:37.591 --> 01:30:44.212]  So, by having a highly visible police car, we hope it has a deterrent effect on people committing crime.
[01:30:44.252 --> 01:30:47.852]  Especially now with the economic downturn where I think that... Crime's going up.
[01:30:47.992 --> 01:30:48.572]  It's going up.
[01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:51.893]  And people that normally would not turn to crime,
[01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:57.194]  That might want to feed their family may turn to it and so we have to be highly visible as a deterrent.
[01:30:58.513 --> 01:31:01.094]  Well, I mean, I've seen the statistics, and I'm glad you'll admit it's going up.
[01:31:01.114 --> 01:31:03.954]  A lot of police chiefs don't want to admit it's going up, but it is exploding.
[01:31:04.154 --> 01:31:09.335]  It is, and we try not to, you know, it is what it is.
[01:31:09.355 --> 01:31:18.777]  You know, you try your best, and in tight economic times, we need to make sure that we as a police department, that we're positioned to keep people safe, because that's our primary function.
[01:31:18.817 --> 01:31:21.258]  I think the primary function of government is to keep people safe.
[01:31:21.278 --> 01:31:23.498]  Well, I'll say one good thing that did happen with the Austin Police.
[01:31:23.518 --> 01:31:26.499]  My parents were out of town, and somebody kind of kicked in the back door, and the alarm went off.
[01:31:27.299 --> 01:31:31.260]  Within two minutes of the alarm going off, the police were there.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.001]  They went in, checked the house, closed the door, waited for me to get there.
[01:31:34.321 --> 01:31:34.681]  Excellent.
[01:31:34.801 --> 01:31:36.441]  And I drove over and they were very nice.
[01:31:36.701 --> 01:31:37.321]  Outstanding.
[01:31:37.361 --> 01:31:43.663]  You know, we've instituted, because you don't have an empty checkbook as a police department.
[01:31:43.883 --> 01:31:45.643]  The taxpayers only have so much money they can give us.
[01:31:46.063 --> 01:31:48.904]  So we now have what's called priority one hot shot calls.
[01:31:49.884 --> 01:31:57.905]  When certain crimes are occurring, we actually respond with lights and sirens now, Code 3, and that's had a really tremendously positive impact on our response times.
[01:31:58.145 --> 01:32:00.886]  Also, it makes the thieves paranoid, because they hear those.
[01:32:00.906 --> 01:32:02.166]  You know what?
[01:32:02.206 --> 01:32:05.207]  What's so funny is that you might have critics out there, and you got it.
[01:32:05.547 --> 01:32:07.967]  You right away figured out why we're doing that, you know?
[01:32:07.987 --> 01:32:12.388]  The comfort level of the crooks, because they hear those sirens, they don't know where they're going.
[01:32:12.708 --> 01:32:18.049]  We've actually been going to a separate hotshot call, one instance where some guys were robbing us.
[01:32:18.069 --> 01:32:19.109]  And it flushes another one out.
[01:32:19.269 --> 01:32:22.673]  Yes, and they hadn't even gotten the money from the restaurant yet.
[01:32:22.733 --> 01:32:28.539]  They heard our police sirens, they left, and then we weren't even going to that car.
[01:32:28.739 --> 01:32:28.999]  Wow.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:32.683]  Police Chief Arte Cervedo, quite a trooper coming in to run the gauntlet.
[01:32:32.943 --> 01:32:34.245]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:32:35.711 --> 01:32:39.454]  Do you have aches and pains or suffer from indigestion or inflammation?
[01:32:39.794 --> 01:32:42.136]  Are you tired of feeling restless from insomnia?

[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.462]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:33:39.482 --> 01:33:41.704]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:33:41.745 --> 01:33:43.286]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:33:43.306 --> 01:33:44.907]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:33:45.028 --> 01:33:47.870]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:51.554]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:34:01.211 --> 01:34:06.082]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:34:09.864 --> 01:34:10.904]  How dare you?
[01:34:12.485 --> 01:34:17.347]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:34:17.367 --> 01:34:20.168]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:34:20.248 --> 01:34:26.451]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:38.942]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:34:39.162 --> 01:34:51.430]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:52.250]  The U.S.
[01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:57.893]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:34:58.274 --> 01:35:00.495]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:35:02.356 --> 01:35:03.417]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:35:03.457 --> 01:35:06.298]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:35:06.418 --> 01:35:12.442]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:35:12.862 --> 01:35:16.204]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:35:16.284 --> 01:35:22.667]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:35:23.207 --> 01:35:27.230]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:35:27.330 --> 01:35:27.590]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:35:30.273 --> 01:35:30.653]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:35:30.853 --> 01:35:36.918]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:35:37.258 --> 01:35:38.399]  eFoods does it again.
[01:35:38.619 --> 01:35:43.403]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[01:35:43.723 --> 01:35:51.869]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:35:52.389 --> 01:35:57.593]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct
[01:35:59.684 --> 01:35:59.984]  We're good
[01:36:16.783 --> 01:36:17.123]  I think so.
[01:36:44.110 --> 01:36:47.072]  Chief, we got cut off by the break, and you're good for the rest of the hour, right?
[01:36:47.152 --> 01:36:47.753]  Yes, yes.
[01:36:47.833 --> 01:36:48.273]  Okay, good.
[01:36:51.075 --> 01:36:57.981]  You were continuing with the visibility of the police to make the crooks... Return effect, yeah.
[01:36:58.561 --> 01:36:59.822]  So, tell us more about that.
[01:37:00.183 --> 01:37:06.808]  So anyway, you know, by having that Code 3 response, it reduces our response times and instills a sense of urgency in our police officers.
[01:37:07.428 --> 01:37:11.071]  And I think it diminishes the comfort level for the crooks.
[01:37:11.552 --> 01:37:15.175]  And so we had a guy, like I said, robbing a pizza place.
[01:37:15.235 --> 01:37:17.096]  Our guys are going to another priority one call.
[01:37:17.356 --> 01:37:18.297]  They hear the sirens.
[01:37:18.658 --> 01:37:19.158]  They split.
[01:37:19.178 --> 01:37:20.179]  Don't even take any money.
[01:37:20.219 --> 01:37:21.059]  Don't hurt anybody.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.284]  And so we were able to thwart a robbery just by changing our response protocol.
[01:37:28.549 --> 01:37:34.711]  Well, I actually don't speed that much, but it actually has helped me a few times, seeing the black and white.
[01:37:35.091 --> 01:37:42.154]  But I've noticed what the police are doing, especially because you've got to raise revenue because the economy's down, is that the police always wait at the bottom of highway hills.
[01:37:42.634 --> 01:37:49.676]  And so I've got to put my car always on cruise control now, which then becomes a problem when I remember to slow down, because if I don't,
[01:37:50.316 --> 01:38:01.409]  I'm going 60 on, say, Capitol Hill, Texas, and there they are, waiting at the bottom, and I look and I'm going 67, and I've got a... I mean, literally, the last few tickets I got, I guess I got one about a year ago, was this... I mean, I'm not...
[01:38:02.515 --> 01:38:05.378]  And used to the cops wouldn't give you a ticket if you're going five, six miles over.
[01:38:05.438 --> 01:38:06.179]  Now they're doing it.
[01:38:06.479 --> 01:38:10.703]  And I don't think that's fair when they're waiting on a hill, hoping you speed up down the hill.
[01:38:10.783 --> 01:38:10.963]  Yeah.
[01:38:11.384 --> 01:38:22.755]  Well, actually, our higher enforcement team usually looks at crash data, and when they decide where to prioritize their patrol, I'd have to look at what hill you're talking about specifically to see what the crash data is.
[01:38:22.955 --> 01:38:24.356]  You know, they're always at the bottom of hills.
[01:38:25.137 --> 01:38:31.679]  Well, but traditionally, depending on how deep of a hill it is, crashes usually occur more because of that reason.
[01:38:31.719 --> 01:38:37.220]  People drive very fast going down the hill, and then going uphill, what happens?
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:37.881]  Slow down.
[01:38:38.381 --> 01:38:38.941]  Well, no.
[01:38:39.581 --> 01:38:42.762]  People end up getting fatality crashes because they're in and out of traffic.
[01:38:42.782 --> 01:38:43.602]  The ones that are in a hurry.
[01:38:44.022 --> 01:38:54.345]  And what'll happen is you have the big rigs, the big trucks that can't really go fast up the hill, and a car will change lanes, and here comes this guy, and all of a sudden we're rear-ended and be decapitated by driving like maniacs.
[01:38:54.445 --> 01:39:00.147]  Well, since I had children, I haven't even had a fender bender, because once you have children, they're with you, and you really start thinking about driving better.
[01:39:00.807 --> 01:39:05.709]  And I see these people that zoom around me for no reason, even when I'm in the slow lane, and now I get mad at them.
[01:39:06.049 --> 01:39:11.391]  I'm like the old man who used to stand out there yelling at me in high school when I'd speed through the neighborhood, because now I'm that old man.
[01:39:11.671 --> 01:39:20.914]  Yeah, well, you see, and the problem is in our country that we lose, every two and a half years, the equivalent of the number of troops that died in Vietnam over ten years on our highways.
[01:39:21.535 --> 01:39:22.335]  Fifty-eight thousand.
[01:39:23.075 --> 01:39:34.247]  And 50% of those on a national level, nearly half, are drunk driving related, which is why I'm really aggressive when it comes to... Well, Chief, but I mean, if you want to stop the drunks, this is what I don't like.
[01:39:34.287 --> 01:39:36.049]  A lot of nights I work till midnight up here.
[01:39:36.469 --> 01:39:37.891]  I'm working on a film right now about Obama.
[01:39:38.271 --> 01:39:38.992]  I left at midnight.
[01:39:39.752 --> 01:39:46.036]  And that's when the cops are out looking for drunks, and they get on my tail, other people's tails, and I'm driving home, and why run checkpoints?
[01:39:46.116 --> 01:39:46.877]  Why take blood?
[01:39:47.277 --> 01:39:51.039]  You can see drunks every night driving home, I see drunks.
[01:39:51.059 --> 01:39:56.723]  They either drive real slow, or they drive fast, or they speed up and slow down, and they're drifting around, and I see drunks every night.
[01:39:56.743 --> 01:39:58.304]  I mean, how could the police not catch them?
[01:39:58.524 --> 01:39:59.425]  Well, no, we do catch them.
[01:39:59.445 --> 01:40:00.485]  The problem isn't catching them.
[01:40:00.505 --> 01:40:06.649]  The problem is, the second part of that is we need to get the evidence to be able to hold them accountable for two reasons.
[01:40:06.829 --> 01:40:15.033]  One, we want to get the conviction, not because we want to punish these folks, but because we want through that conviction comes requirements to go to some educational programs.
[01:40:15.053 --> 01:40:20.256]  But that sets the precedent when you're out there with injectors sucking blood on the side of the road.
[01:40:20.296 --> 01:40:21.917]  I mean, if this is constitutional, why wasn't it done before?
[01:40:26.584 --> 01:40:29.086]  Because it's a matter of people not exercising some leadership.
[01:40:29.126 --> 01:40:30.067]  Let me just say this.
[01:40:30.087 --> 01:40:31.148]  But is it a legal warrant?
[01:40:31.168 --> 01:40:32.490]  Because there are these rubber stamp warrants.
[01:40:33.631 --> 01:40:34.511]  We talked about that.
[01:40:34.652 --> 01:40:35.853]  Well, here's the issue.
[01:40:35.973 --> 01:40:47.243]  If our officers have to prepare what's called a probable cause declaration, you know that in our city our police officers have video cameras in their car where the stop is taped and the actions of the suspect are captured on tape.
[01:40:47.864 --> 01:40:49.626]  If our officers describe behavior
[01:40:50.406 --> 01:41:00.931]  Uh-huh, the Supreme Court just ruled, as you know last week, I have it here on the stack, that the motion to suppress isn't good anymore and the police can even be wrong, it doesn't say by accident, on purpose, and still that case won't be thrown out.
[01:41:17.879 --> 01:41:19.640]  Yeah, I'm familiar with that.
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:32.527]  I read in the paper the other day, but I think when there's an intentional, malicious, there's a difference between a mistake and falsely preparing a probable cause declaration, or annoyingly provide, first of all, it's a crime.
[01:41:33.148 --> 01:41:36.370]  If I describe behavior, there's not an allegation.
[01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:38.351]  But attorney generals don't go after cops for that.
[01:41:39.171 --> 01:41:41.272]  Well, we do get cops convicted every once in a while.
[01:41:41.352 --> 01:41:44.094]  Every day I read about police caught planting drugs on people.
[01:41:44.994 --> 01:41:47.838]  Well I can tell you it hasn't happened since I've been here and we catch somebody planting drugs.
[01:41:48.258 --> 01:41:50.201]  I think you know how I feel about accountability.
[01:41:50.681 --> 01:41:55.047]  We will hold our people accountable because the majority of my cops are excellent, hardworking professionals.
[01:41:55.067 --> 01:41:56.128]  I'm not just saying that because you're here.
[01:41:56.148 --> 01:41:59.773]  I've been all over the country and I want to say about the nicest police in the country are Austin.
[01:41:59.993 --> 01:42:01.294]  But I'm not saying that's too nice.
[01:42:02.135 --> 01:42:13.305]  I mean, I'll never forget a year and a half ago, Perry violates the Federal Law Logan Act, he goes to Bilderberg, he brags about it, I'm bullhorning him, and the Austin PD walks up and says, we're going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[01:42:13.325 --> 01:42:16.408]  And I said, I know Austin's lost a bunch of lawsuits, you better not.
[01:42:16.769 --> 01:42:19.591]  Well, I'll tell you the story when we get back.
[01:42:19.711 --> 01:42:22.894]  Because I had to sit there, and I didn't want to be in a confrontation with him.
[01:42:23.154 --> 01:42:24.535]  He was trying to violate my First Amendment.
[01:42:25.256 --> 01:42:26.177]  We're on the march.
[01:42:26.657 --> 01:42:28.159]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:42:29.168 --> 01:42:31.855]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:42:35.743 --> 01:42:43.369]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[01:42:43.809 --> 01:42:44.970]  You need the Paclite.
[01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:53.276]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[01:42:53.637 --> 01:42:56.799]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[01:42:57.199 --> 01:43:01.643]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[01:43:02.043 --> 01:43:03.304]  The Paclite is so durable,
[01:43:03.564 --> 01:43:07.967]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[01:43:08.387 --> 01:43:12.690]  The Pack Light comes with a 25 year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.

[01:43:41.837 --> 01:43:43.499]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:43:44.654 --> 01:43:45.495]  Who is the enemy?
[01:43:46.015 --> 01:43:46.515]  Bin Laden.
[01:43:46.816 --> 01:43:47.796]  This is his M.O.
[01:43:47.816 --> 01:43:49.117]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:43:49.177 --> 01:43:50.838]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:43:51.178 --> 01:43:57.923]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:43:58.323 --> 01:43:58.763]  Some U.S.
[01:43:58.803 --> 01:44:04.467]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:44:05.147 --> 01:44:08.610]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:10.812]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:39.012]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.761]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[01:45:01.121 --> 01:45:03.222]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:45:03.242 --> 01:45:03.722]  this fall?

[01:45:46.170 --> 01:45:46.512]  Yeah.
[01:46:11.324 --> 01:46:15.907]  Look, I know we've had callers holding for an hour and a half, two hours.
[01:46:15.927 --> 01:46:18.168]  We're just not going to be able to take calls right now.
[01:46:18.188 --> 01:46:22.010]  Besides, we're all for Joe Rogan or Bob Chapman before him.
[01:46:22.090 --> 01:46:22.871]  I apologize.
[01:46:23.251 --> 01:46:24.892]  Got a bunch of big guests tomorrow as well.
[01:46:24.912 --> 01:46:29.475]  I'll try to make some time to take your calls because I'm, I am torn between
[01:46:31.272 --> 01:46:33.093]  Yeah, where was this at?
[01:46:33.133 --> 01:46:33.213]  Okay.
[01:46:48.436 --> 01:46:49.436]  Well, what about Tommy Chong?
[01:46:49.476 --> 01:47:04.419]  The federal case it meant with the marijuana pipes he was selling, his son was, that they sent an informant in to mail the pipe to a city where it was illegal, to bust him, and they still convicted him because they refused over and over again to sell the pipe to the city.
[01:47:04.879 --> 01:47:06.560]  I mean, that's... Who's this?
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:07.200]  Tommy Chong?
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:08.180]  Yeah, Tommy Chong.
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.020]  He spent years in prison for it.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:12.721]  I'm not familiar with... You always bring up cases... Cheech and Chong!
[01:47:12.861 --> 01:47:13.881]  Cheech and Chong, oh, that guy!
[01:47:14.462 --> 01:47:16.483]  Well, yeah, they made some good movies when I was growing up.
[01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:18.764]  Yeah, but that's not right, man.
[01:47:18.904 --> 01:47:20.345]  Yeah, I'm not familiar with it.
[01:47:20.365 --> 01:47:22.506]  You always ask me about stuff I'm not familiar with.
[01:47:23.586 --> 01:47:25.987]  Yeah, but I mean, how do they have informants?
[01:47:26.447 --> 01:47:29.069]  An informant could come in here and plant something.
[01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:31.069]  I mean, none of us are using any drugs, nothing.
[01:47:31.130 --> 01:47:33.531]  Well, so an informant got him his...
[01:47:34.801 --> 01:47:35.461]  Mail something?
[01:47:35.521 --> 01:47:36.301]  Talk to him about mailing something?
[01:47:36.341 --> 01:47:41.902]  They went and got a job there in the city that had a law against it.
[01:47:42.662 --> 01:47:44.103]  It was a federal case doing it with the city.
[01:47:44.123 --> 01:47:45.503]  You know, they're out in California.
[01:47:45.543 --> 01:47:46.643]  This is in Ohio or whatever.
[01:47:46.663 --> 01:47:48.683]  I think it was Ohio.
[01:47:48.963 --> 01:47:55.064]  And they got somebody to get a job there at the office and then they kept catching them.
[01:47:55.344 --> 01:47:57.565]  They should have fired them for trying to mail this pipe to this city.
[01:47:58.125 --> 01:47:59.065]  They knew it was a set-up.
[01:47:59.125 --> 01:48:04.126]  And then the employee, who was the informant, mailed the pipe and then Tommy Chong goes to prison for it.
[01:48:05.475 --> 01:48:14.859]  Well, you know what, I'm not familiar with that, but it would seem to me that the person that mailed it, unless they mailed it at the direction of the employer, may be more culpable.
[01:48:15.039 --> 01:48:17.160]  But their overall thing was to mail everything out.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.101]  But they told them, don't mail to this city.
[01:48:19.781 --> 01:48:20.481]  This is on record!
[01:48:20.601 --> 01:48:20.801]  Yeah.
[01:48:21.001 --> 01:48:27.304]  And then the feds raided the maker of the film and confiscated 10,000 of them, but that only made it explode and blow up, and now it's on Showtime.
[01:48:27.884 --> 01:48:28.204]  Really?
[01:48:28.385 --> 01:48:28.605]  Yeah.
[01:48:29.185 --> 01:48:30.025]  I'll have to check that out.
[01:48:30.625 --> 01:48:30.806]  Yeah.
[01:48:31.066 --> 01:48:31.546]  I haven't seen it.
[01:48:32.247 --> 01:48:36.428]  You know, instead of me interrogating you, would you like to interrogate me, Police Chief Art Acevedo?
[01:48:36.448 --> 01:48:36.588]  Yes.
[01:48:37.148 --> 01:48:39.669]  How often do you see black helicopters?
[01:48:39.729 --> 01:48:40.209]  I'm kidding.
[01:48:40.929 --> 01:48:45.930]  Actually, no, I gotta tell you something, because people ask me, hey, they can't believe that I come on Alex Jones.
[01:48:46.730 --> 01:49:01.054]  And I always tell folks, I don't care how far-fetched you think somebody may be, and I'm not saying you are or you aren't, I think on some issues, and I won't identify them, but on some issues, you, I probably, I kind of agree with you on some of your philosophy.
[01:49:02.054 --> 01:49:18.281]  But I really believe that government has to be responsible and responsive to people and you obviously have a following and that's why I'm here because if you have questions or your viewers or listeners have questions, we want to answer them, especially as they pertain here to the city of Austin.
[01:49:19.221 --> 01:49:20.702]  Well, it's very nice of you to come in.
[01:49:20.722 --> 01:49:22.823]  I was telling you I'd tell you that story.
[01:49:22.903 --> 01:49:25.744]  I'm out there bullhorning the governor at an event.
[01:49:26.568 --> 01:49:30.269]  And about ten police show up and he comes over and he goes, Alex, come here, I want to talk to you.
[01:49:30.329 --> 01:49:30.929]  It was the commander.
[01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:32.090]  It's all on video.
[01:49:32.110 --> 01:49:34.291]  My cameras are stuck in his face and he thinks he's whispering.
[01:49:34.311 --> 01:49:35.291]  We've got a shotgun mic.
[01:49:35.311 --> 01:49:36.051]  We're picking it all up.
[01:49:36.251 --> 01:49:36.911]  This is on YouTube.
[01:49:37.152 --> 01:49:37.332]  Yeah.
[01:49:37.592 --> 01:49:39.812]  And he goes, if you don't leave, we're going to arrest all of you.
[01:49:40.213 --> 01:49:43.234]  And I said, listen, I know I need a permit to block a road or a street.
[01:49:43.274 --> 01:49:43.514]  Right.
[01:49:43.534 --> 01:49:44.474]  This is First Amendment.
[01:49:44.494 --> 01:49:45.654]  The city of Austin's lawsuits.
[01:49:45.674 --> 01:49:47.175]  The state police have lawsuits in Austin.
[01:49:47.455 --> 01:49:48.195]  A whole bunch of them.
[01:49:48.215 --> 01:49:49.796]  I said, New York's losing a bunch of suits right now.
[01:49:50.776 --> 01:49:51.516]  I said, I'm not leaving.
[01:49:51.536 --> 01:49:52.056]  He goes, fine.
[01:49:52.096 --> 01:49:53.377]  And they had the riot police
[01:49:54.397 --> 01:49:55.078]  How long ago was that?
[01:49:55.098 --> 01:49:55.779]  Like a year and a half ago.
[01:49:55.799 --> 01:49:56.980]  Is it my guys or is it state police?
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.340]  It was your guys.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:15.260]  It was a year and a half ago.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.121]  You must have just gotten here.
[01:50:16.141 --> 01:50:20.322]  But the point is, is that then another commander comes up and goes, we're asking you to leave.
[01:50:20.362 --> 01:50:21.802]  And I said, but you're not telling me to.
[01:50:22.182 --> 01:50:25.743]  And then they, and I said, look, I don't want to be your enemy, but you can't be an enemy of the First Amendment.
[01:50:25.923 --> 01:50:27.864]  And I said, go ahead and arrest me, but I'm going to sue you.
[01:50:28.124 --> 01:50:31.945]  And if you can't beat the rap, you know, I mean, you can beat the rap, but you can't beat the riot.
[01:50:32.345 --> 01:50:33.165]  And they understood what that meant.
[01:50:33.185 --> 01:50:34.925]  They left me alone and the big riot police left.
[01:50:35.285 --> 01:50:36.226]  But I mean, you know.
[01:50:36.826 --> 01:50:38.206]  Yeah, I'd be interested in seeing that video.
[01:50:39.827 --> 01:50:41.187]  Guys, pull up, uh,
[01:50:42.193 --> 01:50:43.054]  Look at the name of the video.
[01:50:43.074 --> 01:50:43.895]  It's on YouTube.
[01:50:44.335 --> 01:50:45.736]  Special, we did.
[01:50:46.157 --> 01:50:49.080]  YouTube, Alex Jones protesting Perry.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:50.041]  Cops.
[01:50:50.641 --> 01:50:51.242]  That should bring it up.
[01:50:51.322 --> 01:50:53.504]  I mean, if you've got time after the show, I'll pull it up for you.
[01:50:53.524 --> 01:50:54.765]  Yeah, no, actually, I can do it at home.
[01:50:55.226 --> 01:50:56.967]  I YouTube you on a regular basis.
[01:50:57.368 --> 01:50:58.509]  But, I mean, he's on video.
[01:50:59.330 --> 01:51:00.991]  Oh, is he going to get in trouble or is he going to get promoted?
[01:51:01.592 --> 01:51:02.813]  No, we don't promote problems.
[01:51:02.893 --> 01:51:03.514]  We deal with them.
[01:51:04.147 --> 01:51:04.327]  Yeah.
[01:51:04.987 --> 01:51:07.588]  But why would he come over and say, we're going to arrest you?
[01:51:07.848 --> 01:51:14.350]  You know what, maybe because we do have an ordinance on using the amplified systems and bullhorns without a permit.
[01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:15.551]  You have to have a permit here.
[01:51:15.571 --> 01:51:17.952]  They could have read me a ticket and then if I kept doing it, arrested me.
[01:51:17.992 --> 01:51:20.112]  And then after the ticket, you'd arrest him.
[01:51:20.132 --> 01:51:21.653]  Then you'd escalate up to an arrest.
[01:51:21.673 --> 01:51:22.733]  But he didn't say the bullhorn.
[01:51:23.113 --> 01:51:23.313]  Yeah.
[01:51:23.453 --> 01:51:24.914]  He said this protest.
[01:51:25.802 --> 01:51:30.767]  Yeah, I don't think you can arrest somebody specifically for protesting just for the sake of protesting.
[01:51:31.708 --> 01:51:32.769]  It depends on what you're doing.
[01:51:32.789 --> 01:51:33.890]  As long as you don't block streets.
[01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:35.011]  Yeah, you don't want to block streets.
[01:51:35.231 --> 01:51:41.597]  If you want to have 100,000 people out and take over a major street, you have to, just because it would shut everything down.
[01:51:41.777 --> 01:51:43.038]  Well, I'll put it this way.
[01:51:43.058 --> 01:51:45.681]  I remember when I did the plan for the Democratic National Convention.
[01:51:46.381 --> 01:51:46.641]  Wow.
[01:51:46.822 --> 01:51:56.288]  In L.A., back in 2000 when I was with the California Patrol, and I remember meeting with Senator Tom, what's his name?
[01:51:56.328 --> 01:51:56.708]  Daschle.
[01:51:57.129 --> 01:51:57.709]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:51:57.829 --> 01:52:01.392]  State Senator, who used to be married to Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden.
[01:52:02.355 --> 01:52:05.957]  And he started to ask me, hey, what are you going to do when the naked lesbians get up on the freeway and sit down on the freeway?
[01:52:05.977 --> 01:52:19.886]  I said, look, I'm hoping that you as a responsible leader will not have folks come up on our freeway and block lanes because I'd be concerned about people becoming angry and getting out of their cars and starting to beat on the protesters for their own safety.
[01:52:19.926 --> 01:52:24.970]  So I think that we have our special response unit that handles crowd control.
[01:52:25.711 --> 01:52:26.553]  We're good to go.
[01:52:35.461 --> 01:52:36.861]  To gather to protest the government.
[01:52:36.881 --> 01:52:38.662]  But then there is the public safety issue.
[01:52:38.722 --> 01:52:39.963]  Then there's the public safety issue.
[01:52:40.043 --> 01:52:42.964]  See, the biggest problem is not people are being loud.
[01:52:43.444 --> 01:52:53.087]  It's peaceful protesters that get infiltrated by a handful of, you know, anarchist type that next thing you know they're hurling, they get in the middle of a peaceful crowd and they start throwing rocks and bottles.
[01:52:53.147 --> 01:52:57.528]  Oh, did you hear about Denver where the police in the Denver Post got caught attacking their own police in a staged event?
[01:52:58.409 --> 01:52:58.589]  No.
[01:52:58.649 --> 01:52:59.289]  Six months ago?
[01:52:59.549 --> 01:53:00.369]  Don't know anything about that.
[01:53:03.090 --> 01:53:05.471]  I'm going to put up on screen for everybody right now.
[01:53:05.732 --> 01:53:06.512]  Guys, Google this.
[01:53:06.532 --> 01:53:08.333]  I'm going to get the exact headline.
[01:53:10.614 --> 01:53:17.178]  ACL looks at police attacking police in Denver.
[01:53:19.079 --> 01:53:21.400]  Police attack police in Denver, dressed up like anarchists.
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:26.683]  For the news cameras to then demonize them, and the other cops didn't even know that these were police attacking them.
[01:53:27.148 --> 01:53:29.314]  Well, I'd have a problem if that was the case.
[01:53:29.354 --> 01:53:30.857]  We're not in the business of inciting riots.
[01:53:31.238 --> 01:53:34.146]  But I mean, you're aware in history that police agencies have done that.
[01:53:34.639 --> 01:53:36.281]  Well, I'll put it this way.
[01:53:36.321 --> 01:53:43.328]  I wouldn't be surprised if something like that has happened because in law enforcement there's good and bad in everything and sometimes people become misguided.
[01:53:43.368 --> 01:53:46.091]  That's why it's important to have proper oversight.
[01:53:46.291 --> 01:53:50.676]  You have to make sure we have the appropriate level of supervision and management to ensure that we're doing the right thing.
[01:53:50.696 --> 01:53:57.243]  But who is commanding police in Montreal, Canada, in Denver, in Seattle to do this?
[01:53:58.071 --> 01:53:58.452]  I don't know.
[01:53:58.952 --> 01:54:00.073]  I can't speak for other agencies.
[01:54:00.093 --> 01:54:00.693]  Well, we know who.
[01:54:00.793 --> 01:54:01.554]  Delta Force.
[01:54:01.914 --> 01:54:05.316]  That was in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Seattle Times.
[01:54:05.376 --> 01:54:13.942]  And speaking of that, last time I brought up troops on the streets, you were giggling about it, but I know you're a newshound because you're usually informed of everything I bring up.
[01:54:14.563 --> 01:54:25.150]  Are you aware that the Army War College North Common and others have announced they're going to have 20,000 combat troops to engage the American people and the Army War College says that their new mission will be to suppress civil unrest inside the United States?
[01:54:27.175 --> 01:54:28.641]  I'm not familiar with that now.
[01:54:28.922 --> 01:54:32.154]  Here is the Army Times Exhibit A.
[01:54:33.208 --> 01:54:35.248]  Exhibit A, United States Northern Command, U.S.
[01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:38.469]  Northern Command gains dedicated response force.
[01:54:39.809 --> 01:54:43.010]  And if you read, they say it's for WMDs and stuff, but then they add for civil unrest.
[01:54:44.250 --> 01:54:48.531]  Here's NORTHCOM presents Brigade Homelanders Regular Army.
[01:54:48.971 --> 01:54:50.131]  Here's another one.
[01:54:50.171 --> 01:54:52.872]  I believe that's Newsweek.
[01:54:52.912 --> 01:54:54.372]  Here's the Phoenix Business Journal.
[01:54:54.412 --> 01:54:56.692]  Arizona police say they are prepared as war college warrants.
[01:54:56.952 --> 01:54:58.393]  Military must prep for unrest.
[01:54:58.533 --> 01:54:59.913]  IMF warrants of economic riots.
[01:55:01.047 --> 01:55:18.507]  Yeah, I think that what you're probably talking about is instances where the resources of local, state, and county governments are overwhelmed, that there may be a need at some point to have troops assist in quelling civil unrest.
[01:55:18.687 --> 01:55:20.849]  What I mean by civil unrest, I'm talking about violent
[01:55:23.191 --> 01:55:25.172]  Yeah, I was in L.A.
[01:55:25.192 --> 01:55:30.494]  during the Rodney King riots, and I can tell you that law enforcement response was pretty embarrassing.
[01:55:30.674 --> 01:55:31.174]  Stood down?
[01:55:31.194 --> 01:55:32.334]  Yeah, it was.
[01:55:32.975 --> 01:55:33.655]  Why did that happen?
[01:55:34.515 --> 01:55:35.316]  Lack of leadership.
[01:55:35.716 --> 01:55:43.499]  I was extremely angry, because when you see people starting to burn down, you just roll everybody that's clear.
[01:55:43.659 --> 01:55:45.300]  You just send out an all-point, you know,
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:56.043]  A call out for help for everybody, and my philosophy is that you put as many cops there as soon as you can, as soon as people see you making arrests and taking appropriate action, that will have a return effect on anybody else.
[01:55:56.083 --> 01:55:57.224]  If not, they hysteria.
[01:55:57.544 --> 01:56:03.846]  It just starts spreading, and so, I mean, we lost 50 American lives, I don't remember the exact number.
[01:56:03.866 --> 01:56:04.866]  You know what turned the tide, though?
[01:56:04.886 --> 01:56:07.427]  A lot of it was the Koreans and others up on top of their businesses.
[01:56:08.327 --> 01:56:11.688]  Well, they had to protect their own businesses in some of the locations.
[01:56:12.236 --> 01:56:24.861]  You know, to me that was a very embarrassing situation for me because we should never, as police officers, let it get to a point where we need to have somebody else come in and do our jobs.
[01:56:24.881 --> 01:56:31.684]  We're the peacemakers in this country, we're the peacekeepers in this country, and our job is to not let organizational pride get in the way.
[01:56:32.464 --> 01:56:34.905]  Some departments may be hesitant to call other departments.
[01:56:35.345 --> 01:56:41.888]  I'll be the first to be on the radio asking for help from other agencies here in Central Texas if things start getting out of our hand for us.
[01:56:44.167 --> 01:56:45.208]  Oh, you have the Denver Post.
[01:56:45.288 --> 01:56:46.329]  I'll put it up on screen, please.
[01:56:47.490 --> 01:57:03.085]  ACLU wants proven to police stage DCN protest, DNC protest, and it says right there, police, undercover police attacked other police, pretended to be violent, inflamed other protesters and officers during the most intense night of the four-day event.
[01:57:03.826 --> 01:57:05.246]  So, so we got there.
[01:57:05.426 --> 01:57:06.587]  We're busy getting a rent car.
[01:57:06.647 --> 01:57:07.947]  We're going to drive around in our RV.
[01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:08.527]  We drove there.
[01:57:09.448 --> 01:57:10.468]  And we are changed.
[01:57:10.508 --> 01:57:14.049]  Luke's there and he says, these guys look like cops and they're throwing things at other cops.
[01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:19.490]  And then I watched Fox News and it was, look at the evil anarchist protesters attacking police.
[01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:22.051]  And I said, looks like it's staged, but we don't know.
[01:57:22.071 --> 01:57:22.971]  I wasn't there.
[01:57:23.932 --> 01:57:24.972]  And then it turns out it was.
[01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:26.092]  Yeah.
[01:57:26.232 --> 01:57:31.133]  Well, if it turns out that it was, I can tell you one thing that won't happen here as long as I'm a police chief, I won't tolerate.
[01:57:31.334 --> 01:57:31.834]  Well, I mean, it was.
[01:57:31.854 --> 01:57:32.854]  I mean, the police admitted it.
[01:57:33.806 --> 01:57:34.527]  Is that what that said?
[01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:35.567]  I didn't see it.
[01:57:35.587 --> 01:57:36.668]  Throw it back up on screen for him.
[01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:39.550]  Denver Post, right there.
[01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:42.292]  That's what I love about this new TV thing we're doing.
[01:57:42.412 --> 01:57:44.113]  We can just put everything up.
[01:57:44.413 --> 01:57:45.434]  And see, this is what happened to me.
[01:57:46.314 --> 01:57:53.199]  I got on talk radio, AXS TV in 95, and I was covering the Federal Reserve, but I was more like a Ron Paul guy, more mainstream.
[01:57:55.026 --> 01:58:00.529]  People started calling me going, there were black helicopters south of Houston, they blew up a building.
[01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:01.710]  And I would laugh at them.
[01:58:02.491 --> 01:58:10.536]  And then I started seeing in other parts of Texas, and I found out Delta Force would covertly lease a building, and buy a nursing home in the middle of town, and then blow it up.
[01:58:11.156 --> 01:58:17.238]  I mean, I ended up going to these events, and buildings are on fire, and there's cribs running around, and police are coming up saying, turn your cameras off.
[01:58:17.258 --> 01:58:19.218]  And then you find out it was an urban warfare drill.
[01:58:19.278 --> 01:58:22.539]  And then the San Antonio Police Chief, Ali Philippus, refused to be paid off.
[01:58:22.899 --> 01:58:24.079]  They brought bags of cash in.
[01:58:24.099 --> 01:58:25.580]  I mean, I went to his office.
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:26.820]  I had an interview with the police chief.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:30.461]  And he said that when I said no, they went and bribed other city officials.
[01:58:31.041 --> 01:58:41.264]  To do an urban warfare drill, which I had the Rand Corporation documents that it was to condition the public for future martial law and acclimate the police and governors to accept this.
[01:58:41.364 --> 01:58:44.365]  Now, then I said, okay, this black helicopter stuff's all real.
[01:58:44.865 --> 01:58:47.826]  I'm going to start going to these public drills with Marines.
[01:58:48.227 --> 01:58:49.127]  So I went to Oakland.
[01:58:49.767 --> 01:58:52.809]  And we got Hebron, Maryland, and we'd have police walk over with Marines.
[01:58:52.829 --> 01:58:55.030]  They'd turn their cameras off, and we'd sneak around the bushes and get it.
[01:58:55.490 --> 01:58:58.072]  And they'd have role players screaming, I'm an American, not the camp!
[01:58:58.392 --> 01:59:00.153]  And the Marines would say, get ready for an execution.
[01:59:00.173 --> 01:59:03.775]  They'd put Americans down on their knees, and they'd practice shooting us in the back of the head.
[01:59:03.815 --> 01:59:04.676]  It's all on video, sir!
[01:59:05.276 --> 01:59:07.797]  I can give you all these, I'm telling you, just like I showed you the Denver Post.
[01:59:08.297 --> 01:59:10.317]  And I went on the air and I totally changed in 1998.
[01:59:10.397 --> 01:59:13.418]  I said, ladies and gentlemen, this is insane.
[01:59:14.058 --> 01:59:20.020]  And because they know most of the police chiefs are nice, most of the public are nice, they're going to incrementally give us excuses, incrementally.
[01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:20.640]  And see now?
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:23.621]  Oh, we've got to have them for civil unrest, the Army.
[01:59:24.401 --> 01:59:26.062]  Regular army deployed in America.
[01:59:26.722 --> 01:59:29.023]  See, that's my awakening.
[01:59:29.243 --> 01:59:29.943]  This is real.
[01:59:29.983 --> 01:59:30.724]  This stuff's real.
[01:59:31.324 --> 01:59:35.546]  People can differ on my interpretation, but I've witnessed Marines training to take our guns.
[01:59:36.086 --> 01:59:38.547]  With people saying, I'm an American, please don't go to the camp.
[01:59:38.967 --> 01:59:43.769]  And then when CNN reported, Marines are training in Oakland today to go to Bosnia.
[01:59:44.724 --> 01:59:45.485]  It wasn't Bosnia.
[01:59:45.985 --> 01:59:47.066]  They were trading for America.
[01:59:47.446 --> 01:59:48.107]  And I was there.
[01:59:48.647 --> 01:59:51.269]  And we climbed through fences and we climbed around on our bellies.
[01:59:51.749 --> 02:00:01.557]  I've had troops before to confiscate footage from us in San Antonio walk up and stick a 45-yard chest, grab my camera guy, slam him down and take our camera and say, you're lucky.
[02:00:02.711 --> 02:00:04.352]  Well, like I said, I can't speak to that.
[02:00:04.392 --> 02:00:05.614]  That ended up being in the newspaper.
[02:00:05.774 --> 02:00:07.755]  That's not happening here in Austin.
[02:00:07.775 --> 02:00:12.620]  I'm the police chief in Austin, Texas, and my responsibility is to the people of Austin.
[02:00:13.781 --> 02:00:29.234]  We believe that we have the resources to handle our own issues, and we have plenty of allied agencies near us that can help us, and I hope that we never get to the point where we have to turn over our own public safety to some other agency or some other entity.
[02:00:29.454 --> 02:00:41.958]  Well, I want to say this, as things break down and we go into this controlled depression, I've been called a wimp by some people who always call for violence, but they never do it themselves, for not saying go out and riot and go out and blast and go out and burn.
[02:00:42.918 --> 02:00:49.260]  So on record, I am non-violent, unless it means somebody's taking me and my children and putting us on army trucks, which they're trained for.
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.661]  Houston Chronicle, they build FEMA camps.
[02:00:51.221 --> 02:00:54.483]  So up to that point, I'm not going to a Mao Zedong re-education center.
[02:00:54.863 --> 02:01:04.387]  But to that point, I'm telling folks, the enemy is not the police and the ground troop military, and it's only going to help the global architects bring in a new world order if we get to that point.
[02:01:04.447 --> 02:01:16.293]  So that's why I want to have this, you know, this Congress we're having, because if we don't, I mean, this is very real, and you're going to see it unfold, Chief.
[02:01:16.453 --> 02:01:16.873]  Just watch.
[02:01:17.293 --> 02:01:32.050]  Well, I think the important thing in a democracy is that we have to be informed, we have to be engaged, and you know, I always tell people, you can sit back and, the reason I'm a police chief is I didn't like some of the things that I'd see growing up when I was a police officer.
[02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:37.696]  You can either spend 30 years in a career complaining about things, or you can position yourself to be a change agent.
[02:01:38.397 --> 02:01:43.060]  And I've always chosen to try to increase my sphere of influence so I can make a difference.
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:48.042]  So I think that the population that, and your listeners, that violence is never the answer.
[02:01:48.082 --> 02:01:52.765]  Violence should be the last resort in any situation.
[02:01:52.785 --> 02:01:54.986]  It should only be in a life or death situation.
[02:01:55.486 --> 02:01:56.747]  You've got to engage your government.
[02:01:56.767 --> 02:01:57.928]  You've got to question your government.
[02:01:58.068 --> 02:02:07.573]  And, you know, sometimes maybe you need to run for office and be part of the decision makers so you can weigh in on which direction you want your government to go in.
[02:02:08.052 --> 02:02:09.834]  Well, we need good people to do that.
[02:02:10.976 --> 02:02:12.477]  Where did you learn the term change agent?
[02:02:12.497 --> 02:02:24.592]  I don't know where I learned it, but I consider myself a change agent, and I really believe that in my career, I'm really proud of the fact that wherever I've been, I've felt that I've been an agent for positive change.
[02:02:25.333 --> 02:02:26.935]  And positive change in a nutshell is?
[02:02:28.209 --> 02:02:45.644]  Making sure that we're doing the right things for the right reasons, that we treat people with respect, that we respect the rights of our individuals, and more importantly, from a police perspective, that we always police in a manner that's consistent with the constitutional requirements and with the law of the land.
[02:02:46.857 --> 02:02:51.180]  Well, Chief, I notice your crew is out there standing at the door, but you've agreed to stay to the final segment.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.361]  You can stay another eight minutes, can't you?
[02:02:52.561 --> 02:02:52.761]  Sure.
[02:02:53.141 --> 02:02:54.122]  We've got to take a quick break.
[02:02:54.142 --> 02:02:55.162]  Are they yelling at me yet?
[02:02:55.223 --> 02:02:55.763]  No, no, they're not.
[02:02:55.803 --> 02:02:58.785]  We're going to come back in a... they're just moving closer to the door.
[02:02:59.145 --> 02:03:01.146]  Your bodyguards are in attack stance out there.
[02:03:01.226 --> 02:03:01.947]  That's not a bodyguard.
[02:03:01.967 --> 02:03:02.948]  You're going to think I'm a bodyguard.
[02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:03.528]  I'm joking.
[02:03:03.548 --> 02:03:04.188]  He's leaning back.
[02:03:04.429 --> 02:03:05.429]  Who is this nice fella?
[02:03:05.509 --> 02:03:06.910]  That's my general support officer.
[02:03:06.970 --> 02:03:08.872]  He's Dennis Ferris.
[02:03:09.492 --> 02:03:10.993]  Sometimes he's with me, sometimes he's not.
[02:03:11.013 --> 02:03:12.234]  Depends on how busy my schedule is.
[02:03:13.171 --> 02:03:16.177]  He was telling me about how good your wiretaps are, that they're better than the FBI.
[02:03:17.079 --> 02:03:17.560]  Yeah, did he?
[02:03:18.041 --> 02:03:18.262]  Yeah.
[02:03:18.282 --> 02:03:20.286]  Okay, Ferris, you're to be seen, not heard.
[02:03:20.306 --> 02:03:21.108]  We've talked about that.
[02:03:22.796 --> 02:03:25.778]  Uh-oh, now Ferris is going to tell all the commanders to get Jones.
[02:03:26.778 --> 02:03:27.618]  Get Jones!
[02:03:27.638 --> 02:03:33.742]  Alright, we're going to give out the Austin Police Department website and talk more about that in the final segment with the Police Chief Art Acevedo.
[02:03:34.262 --> 02:03:34.902]  It's been great having him.
[02:03:35.182 --> 02:03:40.825]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:03:41.025 --> 02:03:46.088]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:03:46.428 --> 02:03:51.513]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:03:51.813 --> 02:03:57.398]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:03:57.719 --> 02:04:03.724]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:04:03.945 --> 02:04:07.448]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:04:07.708 --> 02:04:12.251]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:04:12.531 --> 02:04:13.312]  Do your part.
[02:04:13.592 --> 02:04:15.853]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[02:04:16.214 --> 02:04:25.059]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[02:04:34.736 --> 02:04:37.258]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:37.598 --> 02:04:38.879]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:04:39.159 --> 02:04:41.140]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:43.061]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:04:43.201 --> 02:04:44.442]  The late, great USA.
[02:04:44.702 --> 02:04:46.103]  America, freedom to fascism.
[02:04:46.463 --> 02:04:53.287]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.381]  We're good.
[02:06:38.214 --> 02:06:41.015]  I want to thank... No, she doesn't want to be plugged.
[02:06:41.075 --> 02:06:43.457]  If I do, she won't... Let me get through to you again to set you up.
[02:06:43.517 --> 02:06:44.077]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:06:44.097 --> 02:06:45.658]  No, but you know how to get a hold of me.
[02:06:45.758 --> 02:06:47.478]  I gave you my cell phone, so... Yes.
[02:06:47.679 --> 02:06:48.159]  You can do it.
[02:06:49.119 --> 02:06:50.020]  You're really working on me.
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:52.081]  You said we're going to go eat Mexican food because you live in the same neighborhood.
[02:06:52.261 --> 02:06:53.741]  Yeah, Mexican food sounds good.
[02:06:54.462 --> 02:06:55.422]  That's all I basically eat.
[02:06:55.442 --> 02:06:56.263]  That's why I got this figure.
[02:06:57.443 --> 02:06:58.524]  Anyway... Yeah, let me know.
[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:04.002]  Okay, listen, I'm going to plug this sponsor chief and give you the floor at the end because we appreciate you coming in here.
[02:07:04.502 --> 02:07:06.043]  You think you're going to turn us, we're going to turn you.
[02:07:06.363 --> 02:07:10.065]  You're going to end up being a rebel leader against the New World Order.
[02:07:10.405 --> 02:07:15.507]  Seriously, folks, MySolarBackup.com, 877-327-0365.
[02:07:16.068 --> 02:07:23.591]  This is a great little unit, the best sponsor we could find out there because we love to find high quality products.
[02:07:23.991 --> 02:07:24.351]  It's 1800 watt,
[02:07:25.512 --> 02:07:26.433]  Power System.
[02:07:26.473 --> 02:07:33.619]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of power source 1800, power plant and high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:07:33.639 --> 02:07:36.782]  That's right, it generates free electricity once you've purchased it.
[02:07:37.062 --> 02:07:42.427]  MySolarBackup.com, the system that stores the power, the solar panels, the controller, everything.
[02:07:42.748 --> 02:07:43.808]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:07:43.869 --> 02:07:44.990]  If their lines are busy, keep trying.
[02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:45.050]  877-327-0365.
[02:07:50.014 --> 02:07:51.355]  Zero, three, six, five.
[02:08:20.294 --> 02:08:24.797]  From the humidity in the air and great tasting pure H2O exactly the way nature makes it.
[02:08:25.078 --> 02:08:29.160]  Then it goes through seven filters after it's grabbed out of the atmosphere.
[02:08:29.421 --> 02:08:33.643]  Find out more at acolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[02:08:34.004 --> 02:08:36.545]  Chief, I've thrown a lot of questions at you.
[02:08:36.585 --> 02:08:37.426]  I appreciate you coming in.
[02:08:37.466 --> 02:08:39.187]  My last question is this.
[02:08:39.207 --> 02:08:41.409]  I know it's your job to enforce the law.
[02:08:41.869 --> 02:08:48.693]  State of Texas has ruled, the state court has ruled that the company with the red light cameras in Austin and Texas wide is illegal.
[02:08:48.753 --> 02:08:54.096]  They don't have the license to have it, the private investigator license to be able to gather data.
[02:08:54.417 --> 02:08:58.439]  There's no police officer and jurisprudence involved to write the ticket to make the call.
[02:08:58.499 --> 02:09:00.160]  Same reason they were thrown out in San Diego.
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:01.381]  Actually, we write the tickets here.
[02:09:01.641 --> 02:09:05.583]  Yeah, well, it's still here, and the news is saying, and the state's saying it's illegal.
[02:09:05.923 --> 02:09:07.964]  Why is Austin saying they don't care and they're keeping them in?
[02:09:08.084 --> 02:09:14.507]  You know, I think that's, first of all, police officers here review every one of those violations, and we're the ones that issue the citations.
[02:09:14.527 --> 02:09:17.468]  We do not leave that to the... Why does the state court say it's not right?
[02:09:18.008 --> 02:09:26.056]  I think it was a local court, municipal court in Dallas and it's under review and I think the city's, I'm not a lawyer, so the city's position is a little different than that.
[02:09:26.316 --> 02:09:38.847]  But I will tell you this, one of the things that I think is important is that when we put those red light cameras, they have to be, we have to position them based on crash data and not on violation data because it should be about safety and not revenue.
[02:09:39.969 --> 02:09:46.896]  So, I can't speak to the legal aspect of that because I'm not a lawyer, but I'm aware of what you're talking about.
[02:09:46.976 --> 02:09:48.497]  So that's the city and the city attorneys?
[02:09:48.517 --> 02:09:49.098]  That's their issue?
[02:09:49.118 --> 02:09:50.499]  That's the city attorney, yes sir.
[02:09:50.519 --> 02:09:57.727]  But I will tell you that we, police officers, not the vendor, review the violations and we're the ones that issue it to make sure that they're being issued right.
[02:09:58.021 --> 02:10:03.446]  How do folks find out more about your particular office as the Austin Police Chief or check out some of the programs you've got going?
[02:10:03.826 --> 02:10:10.453]  They can go to our website, www.ci.austin.tx.us backslash police.
[02:10:12.154 --> 02:10:19.681]  One thing I do want to say again is that I know that some of your listeners are really worried about my DWI blood draw and search warrant issues.
[02:10:20.081 --> 02:10:22.684]  If they have questions, tell them to just email me or call me.
[02:10:23.924 --> 02:10:27.526]  I'll be more than happy to discuss it with them, because at the end of the day what we're trying to do is save lives.
[02:10:27.746 --> 02:10:28.547]  What's your email, sir?
[02:10:29.487 --> 02:10:31.548]  It's Art.Acevedo at C.I.
[02:10:32.169 --> 02:10:34.670]  I don't know if I should do this, I've went over millions of them.
[02:10:34.690 --> 02:10:35.010]  What is it?
[02:10:35.170 --> 02:10:36.931]  Art.Acevedo at C.I.
[02:10:37.131 --> 02:10:44.115]  All they've got to do is Google Austin Police Department website, and the Chief's office, and it's all right there.
[02:10:44.395 --> 02:10:48.477]  And I know my wife's listening online, so I wanted to say hi to my beautiful wife, Tanya.
[02:10:49.077 --> 02:10:50.338]  I miss you, and I'll see you later on tonight.
[02:10:51.024 --> 02:10:51.444]  All right.
[02:10:51.664 --> 02:10:53.865]  I've got to have you in the Sunday Show, but it's on 590.
[02:10:54.305 --> 02:10:56.426]  But we are on 1300 here in Austin and 90.1.
[02:10:57.066 --> 02:10:58.787]  Police Chief, thank you for coming in.
[02:10:58.807 --> 02:10:59.467]  And it's good.
[02:10:59.547 --> 02:11:02.128]  Just please, again, I'm not doing anything wrong.
[02:11:02.188 --> 02:11:03.169]  Please don't send the SWAT teams.
[02:11:04.549 --> 02:11:04.990]  No more smoking.
[02:11:05.010 --> 02:11:07.210]  Uh-oh, he just outed me.
[02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.451]  Bye.
[02:11:07.851 --> 02:11:08.651]  All right, take care.
[02:11:08.691 --> 02:11:09.251]  There he goes.
[02:11:09.631 --> 02:11:10.752]  Police Chief Art Acevedo.
[02:11:11.012 --> 02:11:12.813]  Retransmission with all the important guests.
[02:11:12.833 --> 02:11:13.913]  Joe Rogan, Bob Chapman.

[02:11:43.516 --> 02:11:46.458]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
