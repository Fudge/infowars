[00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:40.530]  IRN USA Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan.
[00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:49.857]  Democrats say President Barack Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan will create millions of good-paying jobs and help families and businesses stay afloat.
[00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:58.002]  Once the plan is put into action, a new website, recovery.gov, will allow any American to watch where the money goes and weigh in with constant questions.
[00:00:58.523 --> 00:01:00.224]  And I encourage every American to do so.
[00:01:00.868 --> 00:01:04.970]  Ultimately, this is your money, and you deserve to know where it's going and how it's spent.
[00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.411]  The President will sign the measure into law Tuesday in Denver.
[00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:16.855]  And Chrysler and GM are racing towards a Tuesday deadline to submit plans to show the government how they will become viable and repay billions in loans.
[00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:20.116]  But GM talks with autoworkers have broken off.
[00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:21.817]  Here's Tom Krishner.
[00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:26.278]  They're kind of on a treadmill that really not much is being accomplished, but they're still talking at Chrysler.
[00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:29.880]  Ford has said it can make it through 2009 without government help.
[00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:33.082]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:38.054]  Men and women, if you've got 10 to 30 pounds or more to lose, please listen carefully.
[00:01:38.354 --> 00:01:39.975]  Guys, many of us tend to overeat.
[00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:42.216]  We eat too much red meat, fast foods, and processed foods.
[00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:44.837]  This keeps the belly flabby and keeps our bodies overweight.
[00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.859]  Ladies, have you ever said, I feel fat today?
[00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.279]  Or do you have this bloated feeling?
[00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.461]  And how many of you have been trying to lose the same 10 to 20 pounds for years?
[00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:54.223]  There's a healthy and faster way to lose weight than any diet pill.
[00:01:54.343 --> 00:02:03.768]  It's called EverCleanse, a clinically proven weight loss and detox formula that helps you lose weight and get rid of the 5 to 25 pounds of waste that some experts say is trapped to the colon walls like spackle or paste.
[00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:06.190]  Two weeks of EverCleanse may be equal to months of dieting.
[00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.010]  It's simple, too.
[00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.472]  Natural, tasteless crystals that dissolve in any food or beverage.
[00:02:09.832 --> 00:02:14.415]  EverCleanse will flatten out your midsection, reduce love handles, and bellies and bloating have been disappearing in just days.
[00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:18.798]  You see, EverCleanse gets rid of the weight you can't take off by exercising or starving yourself on a diet.
[00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.880]  And it's not something you have to take for the rest of your life.

[00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:38.769]  The Obama administration has agreed to participate in planning for a U.N.
[00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.009]  conference on racism.
[00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.891]  The State Department, however, says it will decide later on whether to attend the conference.
[00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:46.772]  Here's Carlotta Bradley.
[00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:52.554]  A statement says the group that takes part in the planning meeting will review the direction of the conference preparations and whether the U.S.
[00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:53.774]  should even be part of the event.
[00:02:54.134 --> 00:03:00.537]  It says the goal is to work with other countries that want the conference to responsibly and productively address racism around the world.
[00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:06.700]  And residents of the small New York town where a commuter plane went down are trying to deal with the tragedy the best they can.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.702]  Everyone in the tiny Buffalo suburb seems to have known a victim.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.005]  Clearance Emergency Coordinator David Besanat says there's a snowstorm on the way predicted for this Wednesday.
[00:03:17.025 --> 00:03:21.289]  It will only force us to pick up the pace to our absolute best.
[00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.232]  No one wants to work in extreme conditions.
[00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:27.915]  We're very fortunate to have these couple of days of clear sky.

[00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.596]  The Iraqi Election Commission acknowledges there was fraud in some cases in last month's elections.
[00:04:11.156 --> 00:04:12.097]  Here's Robert Reid.
[00:04:12.338 --> 00:04:22.448]  Iraqi officials say they've nullified results from the January 31st election at more than 30 polling stations around the country due to fraud in last month's balloting.
[00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:27.810]  But officials say those cases were not significant enough to require a new vote in any province.
[00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.732]  Also today, a bomb hidden in a garbage pile killed one person and injured 18 others in Center City, a section of Baghdad.
[00:04:35.752 --> 00:04:40.914]  Hillary Clinton heads for Asia today on her first trip abroad as Secretary of State.
[00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:51.617]  And as she prepares to leave, there may be an olive branch from North Korea where Pyongyang's ceremonial head of state says the country is ready to improve relations with friendly countries.
[00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:52.769]  U.S.
[00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:58.410]  nuclear envoy Christopher Hill says North Korea must honor its commitment to give up nuclear weapons.
[00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.672]  The DPRK needs to get on with things and complete the denuclearization.
[00:05:05.632 --> 00:05:09.893]  And we've had too many interruptions and the interruptions have slowed us down too much.
[00:05:10.193 --> 00:05:12.974]  And China isn't too happy about parts of the U.S.
[00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:17.755]  stimulus package that favors the use of American goods to help rebuild the economy.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.361]  Here's Henry Sanderson.
[00:05:19.521 --> 00:05:29.766]  They said that measures like this were reminiscent of measures the US took during the Great Depression of the 1930s that tried to protect American jobs but actually just worsened the recession.
[00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:32.987]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:37.651]  Your engine is the heart of your vehicle.
[00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:41.132]  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to determine whether it's going to go the long run?
[00:05:41.312 --> 00:05:44.393]  Or should you dump your vehicle before you experience a major expense?
[00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:48.794]  The military has developed such a technology, and it's called oil analysis.
[00:05:49.074 --> 00:05:58.256]  By taking a mere 4 ounce sample during an oil change, you can get an easy to read, complete report by an independent laboratory covering engine wear, oil condition,
[00:05:58.496 --> 00:05:58.996]  Yes, just $14.95

[00:06:58.902 --> 00:07:00.123]  Welcome, welcome.
[00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:06.948]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday evening.
[00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:27.291]  Or Sunday morning, or in some cases Monday, depending on where you are in the world.
[00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:29.051]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:31.352]  We'll be here for the next two hours live.
[00:07:31.372 --> 00:07:35.894]  It is the 15th day of February 2009.
[00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:44.171]  Well, Barack Obama said that not one minute could be wasted.
[00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:52.416]  They absolutely had to have the 800 plus billion dollar spending package passed immediately or we would have a depression.
[00:07:53.636 --> 00:07:59.720]  And there was a big debate Thursday and Friday that no one had been allowed to see the bill or read the bill.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.123]  The bill was made public one hour before it was finally passed.
[00:08:06.904 --> 00:08:08.865]  It had been in conference between the House and the Senate.
[00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:18.093]  One hour later, the 1,100 plus page, 1,100 plus page bill, one hour after it was made public, was passed.
[00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:22.357]  And then Obama said, I'm going on a three-day vacation, but that's not enough.
[00:08:22.797 --> 00:08:25.860]  I'm then going to sign it maybe next Thursday in Denver.
[00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:27.281]  Maybe.
[00:08:27.802 --> 00:08:29.423]  You see, it's a big joke on everybody.
[00:08:29.463 --> 00:08:35.949]  Going back to the end of George Bush's days, back in early October, October 3rd to be precise,
[00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:47.517]  They said, no one can read the bill, no one can see the bill, we've got to have the banker bail out $700 billion, it really turned out to be $8.5 trillion so far, that's Bloomberg AP, because it's unlimited.
[00:08:48.117 --> 00:08:52.180]  No one can read it, no one can see it, it's got to pass now or we'll have a depression next week.
[00:08:53.301 --> 00:09:05.790]  Then, on Saturday, the day after it passed, October 4th, Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Mr. Paulson said, you know what, we don't even need it for mortgages anymore, we're not going to say what we're going to use it for, this is on record.
[00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:07.463]  Like, they came before Congress.
[00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:08.204]  I have the testimonies.
[00:09:08.264 --> 00:09:10.784]  It's in my upcoming film I'm making, The Obama Deception.
[00:09:11.304 --> 00:09:22.067]  And Obama's people, they brag that the Obama's Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, was the quote, architect of the bailout and honchoed it through the House and Senate when he was a Democratic leader in the House.
[00:09:22.588 --> 00:09:23.788]  He just resigned a few months ago.
[00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:27.909]  And of course, both parties are involved, because they're both owned by the offshore banks.
[00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:31.850]  The issue here is, they didn't want anybody reading the bill.
[00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:34.771]  And you know why they didn't want you reading the bill?
[00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:39.325]  It has health care rationing in it.
[00:09:39.825 --> 00:09:42.867]  It says that the elderly will not be given basic health care.
[00:09:43.327 --> 00:09:51.732]  Tom Daschle literally wrote the legislation and he wrote a book about it two years ago saying, yeah, old folks just have to accept that you're not meant to be treated for these ailments.
[00:09:52.352 --> 00:09:58.856]  And so rationing of health care, in the past they would deny that with socialist health care, but they say it's the British model.
[00:09:59.642 --> 00:10:04.785]  Where people wait 18 months for brain tumor surgery and of course die for treatable brain tumors and things like that.
[00:10:04.825 --> 00:10:08.527]  Or you could have a couple thousand dollar surgery on your eyes but they just let you go blind.
[00:10:10.048 --> 00:10:10.709]  Things like that.
[00:10:11.409 --> 00:10:15.592]  And Bloomberg did a report on this and we covered it on Friday.
[00:10:16.252 --> 00:10:24.657]  You can actually read the subsections because that subsection of the bill was made public because they had tagged it on and admitted they tagged it on the larger bill.
[00:10:24.697 --> 00:10:27.659]  It was the bill, the entirety of the bill itself that was a secret.
[00:10:29.133 --> 00:10:35.146]  Remember two years ago they said, oh it's a secret bill on fixing immigration.
[00:10:35.287 --> 00:10:35.748]  Fixing it!
[00:10:36.633 --> 00:10:38.754]  No one can see it, but trust us, there's no amnesty.
[00:10:38.774 --> 00:10:45.358]  And then Senator Session violated Senate rules and got in trouble for it, but thank God he did, and leaked the bill.
[00:10:45.858 --> 00:10:52.062]  You can Google 20 loopholes in an immigration bill and you can read the 20 loopholes from two years ago.
[00:10:52.562 --> 00:10:55.344]  And it was worse than total amnesty for 30 million illegal aliens.
[00:10:55.884 --> 00:10:58.265]  It allowed felons who were felons to stay here.
[00:10:58.285 --> 00:11:02.968]  It allowed anyone who wanted to come for six years to come here instantly legalized.
[00:11:03.925 --> 00:11:07.347]  So it was more than just an amnesty for the, quote, 14 million they claimed were here.
[00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:11.871]  Though Congress has even studied the problem and said over 30 million.
[00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:14.973]  So this is the type of deception that we see.
[00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:16.534]  But here's the big issue.
[00:11:16.654 --> 00:11:29.963]  I got a call Friday and another call Saturday from the same congressional source that told me they'd been threatened with martial law back in October of last year if they didn't pass the bill.
[00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:33.426]  And we reported the martial law threat before it was on the news.
[00:11:34.142 --> 00:11:38.204]  Then it ended up coming out on C-SPAN, the floor of the House, and then made national news.
[00:11:38.984 --> 00:11:49.868]  Just like a year and a half before, it was made public that the federal government secretly hired now 26,000 preachers training their flock to go to FEMA camps, to turn in their guns, to submit to government.
[00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:56.271]  Romans 13, people didn't believe us, and then a year and a half later it came out in mainstream news and is now public.
[00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:02.413]  This congressional source, it's always been accurate, said that gun control
[00:12:03.662 --> 00:12:08.684]  More gun bans, particularly H.R.
[00:12:08.704 --> 00:12:20.190]  45, total national gun registration, psychological testing to own a gun, if you've ever had a misdemeanor you can't own a gun, that that had been introduced and tagged on through a part of the health spending bill.
[00:12:21.764 --> 00:12:26.945]  Well, last night I went ahead and spent three hours reading most of the 1,100 page bill.
[00:12:26.965 --> 00:12:34.467]  Remember, we didn't get it until an hour before it passed, and I was on air at the time, and then Friday went home and saw my family, and then didn't get around to reading until Saturday.
[00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:37.467]  And yes, that congressional aid was correct.
[00:12:38.768 --> 00:12:41.128]  Now, you'd say, why doesn't the aid just go public?
[00:12:41.748 --> 00:12:44.409]  Because under House rules, they get in trouble.
[00:12:44.549 --> 00:12:46.669]  See, they didn't have these House rules a hundred years ago.
[00:12:47.169 --> 00:12:49.290]  It's now a dictatorship of the committee chairman.
[00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.090]  And so,
[00:12:50.973 --> 00:12:53.855]  They're in these meetings, they're not allowed to tell the public when it's in conference.
[00:12:54.195 --> 00:12:55.537]  So they have to leak this to us.
[00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:58.159]  Just like Senator Sessions did and others.
[00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:02.122]  First he leaked it, people said it wasn't true, then he just released the bill.
[00:13:02.942 --> 00:13:08.126]  And legally, he's really allowed to, it was just a House, a Senate rule in that case.
[00:13:09.547 --> 00:13:19.735]  But regardless of that, they stripped out the language about guns, but left the HR 45 language on the mental screening in there,
[00:13:20.703 --> 00:13:30.610]  For total federalization of all medical records and to make all the psychologists and psychiatrists going back 30, 40 years to load all these records in.
[00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:37.354]  So let's say in high school you went to the psychologist because your parents were, you know, upset because you were depressed and were popping your zits or whatever.
[00:13:38.034 --> 00:13:39.175]  Well, now you don't get to own a gun.
[00:13:39.916 --> 00:13:49.362]  All the military medical records, they've already done this to some extent, but now all the military records, any psychological designation for any reason, you don't get a Second Amendment.
[00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:54.973]  And a lot of police are going to be losing their peace officer's license.
[00:13:56.373 --> 00:13:57.074]  I warned you!
[00:13:57.094 --> 00:14:00.935]  Now, we'll see if they're able to implement this, but the language is in there.
[00:14:01.095 --> 00:14:04.856]  And last night, I almost did an emergency broadcast.
[00:14:04.916 --> 00:14:06.797]  I got my board ops down to the station.
[00:14:07.257 --> 00:14:09.258]  I was about to go on air, and I just said, you know what?
[00:14:09.798 --> 00:14:11.299]  I've got to go finish this Obama film.
[00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:13.099]  A bunch is going on.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.820]  I've got this congressional aide warning me, high level.
[00:14:17.697 --> 00:14:21.741]  But I'm going to wait and see if any of the gun groups pick up on this because I can always cover it Monday.
[00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:23.323]  It's already passed.
[00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:28.147]  So I didn't go on air at like 11 o'clock last night after I'd been reading the bill and confirmed it.
[00:14:28.808 --> 00:14:30.870]  And then I went to Gun Owners of America this morning.
[00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.612]  Sure enough, they're on to it.
[00:14:32.692 --> 00:14:33.893]  It's a headline on their site.
[00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:35.995]  So not just Alex Jones saying it.
[00:14:38.115 --> 00:14:41.676]  We now have it right here from Gun Owners of America.
[00:14:42.056 --> 00:14:44.797]  Pork bailout bill could ban guns from millions of Americans.
[00:14:45.297 --> 00:14:48.258]  This is from Gun Owners of America, the second largest gun organization.
[00:14:48.658 --> 00:14:52.380]  Second Amendment group in the United States with 300,000 members.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.160]  So they analyze it more than you right there.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:55.841]  So there you have it.
[00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.682]  You don't have to go off my secret congressional source.
[00:14:59.342 --> 00:15:02.943]  They picked up on it, so it's there for everybody to see.
[00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:10.446]  There's a bunch of other gun banning and gun restricting and ban all semi-autos, most handguns, most rifles.
[00:15:10.706 --> 00:15:18.773]  There's another bill where the Attorney General can just give an order and ban any guns he wants, like he's a petty god or something, some demigod.
[00:15:21.114 --> 00:15:27.319]  And don't think they won't try to pass that, because what did the bill they passed on October 3rd of last year say?
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.660]  Known as the Banker Bailout.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.781]  It was really a Banker Takeover.
[00:15:30.602 --> 00:15:33.204]  It said in the subsections, and we've read this on air many times,
[00:15:33.988 --> 00:15:39.010]  That no agency, no group of government, no one can look into these numbers.
[00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.730]  It is secret.
[00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:49.433]  So Congress passes a law handing over their authority and ceding some letter of marque to offshore private banks to literally be above the law.
[00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:51.174]  That's fraud.
[00:15:51.214 --> 00:15:51.894]  They can't do that.
[00:15:54.175 --> 00:15:54.775]  But they did.
[00:15:54.895 --> 00:16:03.458]  And now I have all these congressional hearings the last few months where they call up Federal Reserve Chairman of New York, the Fed Chairman himself, Bernanke, and they just say, we don't have to tell you.
[00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.633]  And then Greenspan goes on Laird News Hour and says, we're above the law, no one can investigate us.
[00:16:10.153 --> 00:16:15.757]  We've played that clip before, you can just Google Greenspan, fed above the law, you'll see Laird News Hour.
[00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:18.318]  There's a bunch of other stuff in the bill.
[00:16:18.338 --> 00:16:20.359]  It is a total nightmare.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.482]  But that's why they wanted to rush it through, so nobody could read it, just like the Patriot Act.
[00:16:28.084 --> 00:16:30.266]  We're going to cover all this when we get back and take a lot of phone calls.
[00:16:30.286 --> 00:16:34.109]  Then we have a big guest coming on with a huge story about FEMA camps and mass graves.
[00:16:34.609 --> 00:16:35.830]  The headlines are clear.
[00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:38.893]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:41.835]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[00:16:42.556 --> 00:16:44.177]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[00:16:44.317 --> 00:16:47.459]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.262]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.
[00:16:52.283 --> 00:16:55.704]  Now, Survivalist Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[00:16:55.924 --> 00:16:59.285]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[00:16:59.305 --> 00:17:06.307]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance, that's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[00:17:06.787 --> 00:17:09.908]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[00:17:09.948 --> 00:17:20.551]  Big John Lipska, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him, restaurants, and small delis.
[00:17:20.591 --> 00:17:21.371]  Don't buy from copycats.
[00:17:21.451 --> 00:17:22.012]  I don't know.
[00:17:35.265 --> 00:17:37.207]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[00:20:48.141 --> 00:20:53.504]  That's right, the children of the beast are the ones taking over our country, our world.
[00:20:53.524 --> 00:21:04.910]  That's all we see throughout history is tyrants, corrupt, wicked criminals getting control of government and then taking control of societies and doing horrible things.
[00:21:06.437 --> 00:21:08.139]  Now remember, it had to be passed.
[00:21:08.219 --> 00:21:09.079]  No one could read it.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.664]  They couldn't even have one day to look at the 1,100 plus page bill.
[00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:16.406]  For the last two weeks, they wouldn't let the public see it.
[00:21:16.446 --> 00:21:20.030]  They kept changing and it kept going back and forth between the House and Senate.
[00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.853]  The Revitalization Act, the stimulus bill, it had to be passed.
[00:21:24.313 --> 00:21:26.936]  Eight hundred and something billion, but it has mandates in it.
[00:21:27.688 --> 00:21:33.372]  According to CNBC, of over nine trillion dollars in the next four years.
[00:21:33.472 --> 00:21:36.074]  So it's really a nine trillion dollar quote stimulus.
[00:21:36.114 --> 00:21:42.679]  It's really a expansion of federal takeover of the states, where they take our tax money, then bring it back into the states for control.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.081]  And then, here's an article right here.
[00:21:46.302 --> 00:21:47.102]  What's the rush?
[00:21:47.262 --> 00:21:49.344]  Urgent stimulus on hold.
[00:21:50.686 --> 00:22:03.076]  For the Obama's weekend off, after pushing Congress for weeks to hurry up and pass the massive $787 billion stimulus plan, President Obama promptly took off for a three-day holiday getaway.
[00:22:04.417 --> 00:22:11.002]  Obama arrived at the home in Chicago on Friday and treated his wife to a Valentine's Day dinner downtown last night.
[00:22:14.184 --> 00:22:19.188]  The couple was spotted leaving upscale Table 52, which specializes in southern cuisine,
[00:22:20.191 --> 00:22:23.333]  With the First Lady toting what appeared to be a doggy bag.
[00:22:23.373 --> 00:22:34.058]  The President plans to spend the President's Day weekend in the Windy City and is not expected to sign the bill until Tuesday when he travels to Denver to discuss his economic plans.
[00:22:34.078 --> 00:22:40.120]  He's going to wait, could have signed it Friday, he's going to wait 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days to sign that.
[00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:43.102]  Both the House and the Senate passed the bill Friday.
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:56.283]  The push to get the bill through before the holiday weekend was so frantic, members of Congress didn't have a chance to read the 1071 pages of the document before they could vote.
[00:22:56.784 --> 00:23:01.725]  In a perfect world, it would have been nice to have had more time to process it, said Ian
[00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:07.018]  Kayoski, a spokesman for Representative Gerald Nadler, Democrat in New York.
[00:23:07.058 --> 00:23:11.561]  Meanwhile, Governor Patterson called yesterday for fiscal restraint, with the maximum influx of federal aid.
[00:23:11.601 --> 00:23:18.505]  His budget office estimated that New York will receive $24.6 billion over the next two years, $4 billion more than first believed.
[00:23:18.986 --> 00:23:22.888]  So, meet the new boss, same as the old boss, got fooled again.
[00:23:23.809 --> 00:23:24.749]  They did the same thing.
[00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:30.073]  If the Democrats and Republicans together, bought and paid for by Wall Street, they pass the banker bill,
[00:23:31.138 --> 00:23:36.463]  That is now over eight trillion dollars, according to major financial publications.
[00:23:37.684 --> 00:23:44.390]  But Congress has asked for specifically where the money was spent, and they're told, hey, you passed a bill saying no oversight by any agency or any government.
[00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:44.830]  Period.
[00:23:44.951 --> 00:23:45.551]  Or any court.
[00:23:47.253 --> 00:23:49.194]  And so they sit there laughing at Congress.
[00:23:49.234 --> 00:23:51.456]  Most of them are already on the payroll, so why do they care?
[00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:52.858]  As Rome burns.
[00:23:52.918 --> 00:23:54.199]  As Rome collapses around them.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:55.900]  That's the idea.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.701]  Have a fire sale.
[00:23:56.741 --> 00:23:57.502]  Implode the economy.
[00:23:58.624 --> 00:24:07.810]  And by the way, the supposed banker bailout money, that goes to the banks, taxpayers pay for it, and then the banks loan it back to the government in the stimulus plan.
[00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:24.620]  And then, I've heard a lot of economists admit that this actually froze more credit because the money going to the banks basically held up any other money actually getting out of the population because it all went right back into government or to offshore banks.
[00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:28.095]  So there you have it.
[00:24:28.495 --> 00:24:30.096]  They had to have the bill passed.
[00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:32.038]  They had to have it passed now.
[00:24:33.379 --> 00:24:40.264]  They had to have it passed yesterday, but now they're going to wait four to five days before signing the bill, and it's all a big joke.
[00:24:40.304 --> 00:24:45.388]  The whole point was they didn't want anybody reading the bill, and no one did read the bill.
[00:24:45.608 --> 00:24:49.371]  This is up on InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com is from Governors of America.
[00:24:50.772 --> 00:24:54.415]  Pork bailout bill could ban guns for millions of Americans.
[00:24:56.644 --> 00:24:57.424]  They've already done this.
[00:24:57.484 --> 00:25:07.668]  The first thing Bill Clinton did, well, the last thing he did, but they immediately put it into function, was go after veterans.
[00:25:09.248 --> 00:25:25.574]  And people always wondered why, since the days of Korea, if you collapse from heat exhaustion, or you collapse from being on the front lines for three or four days with no sleep, they would give you a month of leave, but then you have a psychological designation of post-traumatic stress or other things, and then that would be with you for the rest of your life.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:41.224]  And then when you now try to go buy a gun since 2000, suddenly veterans everywhere with no criminal record can't buy guns and they go to the NICS instant check system, the instant registration system, and they're told, well, you had a post-traumatic stress.
[00:25:41.764 --> 00:25:46.185]  And they put hundreds of thousands of vets in there but they stopped in 2002 because of lawsuits.
[00:25:47.426 --> 00:25:49.226]  Well, now it's happening again.
[00:25:50.686 --> 00:25:51.727]  But it's worse than that.
[00:25:52.127 --> 00:25:52.647]  They said that
[00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.651]  Why don't I see the staff, Rahm Emanuel, you can pull this up.
[00:25:56.011 --> 00:25:58.493]  Just Rahm Emanuel, gun control, no-fly list.
[00:25:58.533 --> 00:25:59.253]  It'll come up for you.
[00:25:59.793 --> 00:26:09.939]  And he said in a recent speech, and in speeches previous to that, there's quite a few of them, that, well, we need to have like a no-gun list, like a no-fly list.
[00:26:09.979 --> 00:26:15.422]  First he said we need to have a no-fly list and put you on there, and then you can't own a gun.
[00:26:15.482 --> 00:26:18.884]  Over a million Americans entered a blacklist, no judge, no jury, no arrest.
[00:26:19.284 --> 00:26:21.305]  They just put you on there, and it's ever-growing.
[00:26:22.398 --> 00:26:28.002]  But they said we need to have a no-gun list, just like that, that's a quote, no-criminal list.
[00:26:28.063 --> 00:26:30.985]  But they don't arrest you, they don't charge you, you just can't own a gun.
[00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:33.827]  And that's done extra-judicially.
[00:26:33.867 --> 00:26:38.291]  It's outside the courts, it's outside, it's extra-legislative.
[00:26:38.351 --> 00:26:41.113]  It's just done separately by the bureaucracy.
[00:26:43.895 --> 00:26:44.836]  So we have that going on.
[00:26:44.876 --> 00:26:47.258]  But here's this article from Gun Owners of America.
[00:26:47.358 --> 00:26:50.821]  Pork bailout bill could ban guns for millions of Americans.
[00:26:51.710 --> 00:27:00.740]  The Obama administration is putting a lot of pressure on Congress to slam through the most recent 800 billion dollar bailout package before anyone has an opportunity to read it.
[00:27:01.481 --> 00:27:04.244]  The Obama administration intones that the details are unimportant.
[00:27:04.545 --> 00:27:07.328]  The only thing that matters is the bigness and by
[00:27:09.335 --> 00:27:15.378]  Shipping a bill of nearly 900 billion plus interest to our children and grandchildren.
[00:27:15.398 --> 00:27:16.818]  The package is really, really big.
[00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:22.641]  Bigger, in fact, than the budget of our entire government for the last 170 years of our country's experience.
[00:27:23.201 --> 00:27:33.646]  But now that some of the details are finally starting to leak out of Washington, gun owners and a lot of other analysts are beginning to look at the fine print and some of it is particularly scary.
[00:27:34.949 --> 00:27:44.972]  A particular concern to gun owners are sections 13101 or 13,101 through 13,434 of H.R.
[00:27:44.992 --> 00:27:52.014]  1 which would set up the infrastructure to computerize the medical records of all Americans in a government-coordinated database.
[00:27:52.054 --> 00:27:54.434]  Now this was separately in H.R.
[00:27:55.194 --> 00:27:56.375]  45 and they brought it into the bill.
[00:27:57.475 --> 00:28:00.636]  And this is to give people psychological designations
[00:28:02.023 --> 00:28:03.968]  To then ban their gun ownership.
[00:28:03.988 --> 00:28:08.459]  This is bigger than the 1968 Gun Control Act that restricted felons access to firearms.
[00:28:10.324 --> 00:28:10.885]  And it goes on...
[00:28:13.616 --> 00:28:24.587]  This would do by establishing a national coordinator for health information technology tasked with, among other things, providing information to help guide medical decisions at a time and place of care.
[00:28:24.647 --> 00:28:27.410]  And they state in H.R.
[00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:33.236]  45 that they're going to use this to restrict people who ever had a mental designation from owning a firearm.
[00:28:34.102 --> 00:28:41.848]  And notice how the last 30 years they advertise, oh you're depressed, oh you had a car wreck, oh you're in high school, oh go to the counselor, oh get on Ritalin, oh get on Prozac.
[00:28:41.888 --> 00:28:44.350]  Over 100 million prescriptions in 2008 for Prozac.
[00:28:45.011 --> 00:28:56.600]  And to get that paid for by insurance, they have hundreds and hundreds of mental designations and they say, oh you got ADHD, or oh you got post-traumatic stress, or oh you're bipolar, or oh you've got chronic depression.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.742]  We're going to put you on this drug and it's all paid for.
[00:28:59.685 --> 00:29:12.390]  And they state, understand, the new Attorney General Holder stated in lawsuits in court and before the Supreme Court, Rahm Emanuel introduced bills previously, the new Chief of Staff, this whole crew says they're going to ban you from owning guns.
[00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:18.673]  And they're going to do it outside of law through this new database, just do it executively themselves.
[00:29:21.207 --> 00:29:22.250]  Coming up, your phone calls.
[00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.018]  And then, is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves in Marshall Lawn near Chicago?
[00:29:26.278 --> 00:29:30.147]  We've got the reporter on that broke the story and talked to one of the emergency planners.
[00:29:30.187 --> 00:29:30.608]  Stay with us.
[00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:42.223]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:29:42.404 --> 00:29:46.789]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:29:46.949 --> 00:29:51.475]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:29:51.635 --> 00:29:53.037]  It's a documented fact.
[00:29:53.197 --> 00:30:00.503]  Almost 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:30:00.663 --> 00:30:12.513]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[00:31:42.678 --> 00:31:43.858]  You need the Paclite.

[00:31:56.063 --> 00:32:00.505]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:32:00.905 --> 00:32:02.166]  The Paclite is so durable,
[00:32:02.426 --> 00:32:02.706]  Yes, sir.

[00:33:38.086 --> 00:33:41.910]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:53.902]  We are back live, and you're on your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:56.365 --> 00:34:00.169]  Also, Hillary Clinton, a whole bunch of other people.
[00:34:01.517 --> 00:34:10.860]  The new Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, I mean, I've seen five, six articles the last day where they're all announcing, U.S.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:17.663]  Senators are announcing, we need a carbon tax on all human activity, that will fund the government in its shortfall.
[00:34:18.983 --> 00:34:26.566]  Now, when I made the film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, I noticed that they were denying that that was their plan, and of course we would show their
[00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:35.011]  Somewhat confidential, and in some cases secret documents from the North American Union meetings and other things they've been having.
[00:34:35.552 --> 00:34:40.255]  And it was all there, but people said, oh I was making that up, there wasn't any plan for taxes.
[00:34:41.013 --> 00:34:41.233]  I think?
[00:34:58.977 --> 00:35:02.038]  Through the Stratosphere, Curt Demme writes for Infowars.com.
[00:35:02.058 --> 00:35:21.282]  According to the New York Times, Dr. Chu said reaching agreement on legislation to combat climate change would be difficult in the current recession because any scheme to regulate greenhouse gas emissions would probably cause energy prices to rise and drive manufacturing jobs out of the country to other countries where energy is cheaper.
[00:35:22.139 --> 00:35:27.642]  Well, or where they won't have the carbon tax rules like China, India, Mexico, and 160 others.
[00:35:27.682 --> 00:35:32.425]  In fact, they have no carbon restrictions, and so it will actually increase the carbon footprint.
[00:35:32.965 --> 00:35:34.386]  But the globalists aren't worried.
[00:35:34.406 --> 00:35:37.767]  They know carbon dioxide is what plants breathe and is actually good.
[00:35:38.448 --> 00:35:43.110]  It's just a fraud for the dumb yuppies in America, so they can regulate every facet of your life.
[00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.252]  So that's there as well.
[00:35:46.632 --> 00:35:48.593]  All those denials, yet we are right again.
[00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:49.634]  Not because we're smart.
[00:35:49.674 --> 00:35:51.115]  We know how to read the globalist documents.
[00:35:52.256 --> 00:35:54.937]  Rule the planet, so we're accurate.
[00:35:55.037 --> 00:35:57.537]  They just don't want you to know about it until it's too late.
[00:35:58.758 --> 00:36:01.579]  So we'll get into that report as well.
[00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:07.600]  There was a mysterious plane crash that all of you heard about back on Friday.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.781]  9-11 activists who sued government killed in Buffalo plane crash.
[00:36:12.261 --> 00:36:17.923]  One of the passengers aboard the plane that crashed into a house 10 miles from Buffalo New York Airport
[00:36:18.513 --> 00:36:19.694]  It was actually late on Thursday.
[00:36:19.714 --> 00:36:30.879]  It was a 9-11 widow who had questioned the official account of the attack, sued the government, and consistently lobbied for an investigative commission to investigate 9-11.
[00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:35.181]  And she, of course, had... I'd interviewed her years ago.
[00:36:35.201 --> 00:36:36.161]  Many others had interviewed her.
[00:36:36.201 --> 00:36:39.243]  She believed that 9-11 clearly was an inside job.
[00:36:39.283 --> 00:36:43.585]  She got a meeting with Obama privately, and she's dead now.
[00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:52.832]  I am suing because unlike other investigative avenues, my lawsuit requires all testimony be given under oath and fully uses powers to compel evidence.
[00:36:53.032 --> 00:36:57.674]  Eckhart wrote in December 2003 in a statement entitled, My Silence Cannot Be Bought.
[00:36:58.314 --> 00:37:00.995]  The victim's fund was not created in the spirit of compassion.
[00:37:01.055 --> 00:37:06.457]  Lawmakers capped the liability of the airlines at the behest of lobbyists.
[00:37:06.637 --> 00:37:09.178]  By the way, she lost her husband on the 96th floor of one of the towers.
[00:37:10.137 --> 00:37:16.058]  She continues, at the behest of lobbyists who descended on Washington while the September 11th fire still smoldered, she wrote.
[00:37:16.959 --> 00:37:23.700]  Other September relatives who accepted settlements forfeited their right to sue the airline, airport, security companies or other U.S.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:28.601]  organizations that could have been faltered for negligence and inadequate security measures.
[00:37:29.561 --> 00:37:36.603]  This ensured that very little details of the attacks emerged outside of the government-appointed 9-11 commission.
[00:37:37.518 --> 00:37:50.925]  She went on to write in her statement, I want to know what went on so wrong with our intelligence and security systems that a band of religious fanatics was able to turn four U.S.
[00:37:50.985 --> 00:38:00.710]  passenger jets into an enemy force, attack our cities, and kill 3,000 civilians with terrifying ease.
[00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:06.253]  I want to know why 210-story skyscrapers collapsed in less than two hours and why
[00:38:07.262 --> 00:38:09.344]  Escape and rescue options were so limited.
[00:38:09.944 --> 00:38:11.865]  And it went on from there.
[00:38:12.166 --> 00:38:16.909]  She was the co-founder of the steering committee of the group, Voices for September 11th.
[00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:17.490]  Ms.
[00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.472]  Eckhart joined other activists in pushing for an investigative commission.
[00:38:20.912 --> 00:38:27.317]  She met with Obama days before she died.
[00:38:27.817 --> 00:38:29.879]  Obama remarks on plane crash stimulus.
[00:38:29.899 --> 00:38:32.601]  You can pull up the video of this on YouTube, but here's the text.
[00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:34.442]  President Obama, this is from the Washington Post,
[00:38:35.603 --> 00:38:37.385]  Well, thank you all for being here.
[00:38:37.585 --> 00:38:44.832]  Before I begin, I want to say a brief word with the terrible tragedy that took place outside of Buffalo last night.
[00:38:44.872 --> 00:38:48.235]  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends who lost loved ones.
[00:38:48.635 --> 00:38:52.119]  And as always, our thanks goes out to the brave first responders who arrived immediately.
[00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:59.365]  It goes on, tragic events such as these remind us of the fragility of our life, the value of the end of every single day.
[00:38:59.846 --> 00:39:00.787]  One person has stood
[00:39:02.327 --> 00:39:02.867]  That will.
[00:39:03.568 --> 00:39:04.508]  This is him babbling.
[00:39:04.689 --> 00:39:05.609]  It's not me reading.
[00:39:06.009 --> 00:39:13.374]  One person who stood that well was Beverly Eckhart, who was on that flight and who I met with just days ago.
[00:39:13.754 --> 00:39:21.859]  You see, Beverly lost her husband on 9-11, became a tireless advocate for those families whose lives were forever changed on September 11th day.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.721]  Of course, she knows Hillary Clinton is a high-powered Democrat.
[00:39:24.741 --> 00:39:25.161]  She was.
[00:39:25.222 --> 00:39:25.822]  She's dead now.
[00:39:26.843 --> 00:39:29.284]  So there is that report right there.
[00:39:29.324 --> 00:39:30.385]  Very, very suspicious.
[00:39:31.824 --> 00:39:47.588]  If you do the actuary math on someone who lost a husband from 9-11, with someone who had just met with the president, with someone who just died in a plane crash, and the fact that she was a 9-11 truther, and it is billions to one, conservatively.
[00:39:48.448 --> 00:39:54.930]  I want to go to Pat, Tripp, Joe, Lindsay, and others, but first let's go to Zandra in Texas.
[00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.410]  You are on the air, Zandra.
[00:39:57.054 --> 00:39:59.115]  And I believe I'm speaking to you, Al.
[00:39:59.155 --> 00:40:00.335]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:00.696 --> 00:40:01.476]  I'm from St.
[00:40:01.516 --> 00:40:04.137]  Louis, Missouri, and I moved here to San Antonio.
[00:40:04.877 --> 00:40:05.978]  I work for FEMA.
[00:40:06.158 --> 00:40:14.041]  I was a night auditor at a small hotel right outside of Tyler, and they had tornadoes in different counties, Smith County being one of them.
[00:40:14.181 --> 00:40:14.742]  Can you hear me?
[00:40:14.922 --> 00:40:15.402]  Yes, I can.
[00:40:15.902 --> 00:40:16.402]  Oh, okay.
[00:40:16.722 --> 00:40:17.923]  They came in at night,
[00:40:18.641 --> 00:40:21.644]  Set up at the old courthouse that was vacant.
[00:40:22.144 --> 00:40:23.546]  And I thought everything was fine.
[00:40:23.566 --> 00:40:24.406]  You know, they hired me.
[00:40:24.426 --> 00:40:27.870]  They called me a local hire because they hired me on the spot as an auditor.
[00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:37.999]  So I'm looking at all the 18 wheelers coming in with all the equipment and the desk and the chairs and the phone lines putting in.
[00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:39.680]  Okay, everything seemed perfect.
[00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:44.405]  And then at 5.01, when the day was over with,
[00:40:45.106 --> 00:40:51.888]  I'm looking at these same people who were so articulate during the day turn into, I guess, werewolves.
[00:40:51.968 --> 00:40:52.888]  I don't know another name.
[00:40:53.088 --> 00:41:03.650]  Because at night, they would party, not in the hotel that I happen to be an auditor, but across the streets of Vermont and get on top of the pool table, raise their dresses up.
[00:41:04.391 --> 00:41:09.852]  Well, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, just to be specific, so you were a contract worker for FEMA.
[00:41:09.912 --> 00:41:10.572]  When was this?
[00:41:11.692 --> 00:41:13.273]  This was, I guess, the early 90s.
[00:41:14.699 --> 00:41:16.541]  It's right outside of Tyler.
[00:41:17.001 --> 00:41:19.224]  We know a lot of government people like to party.
[00:41:19.244 --> 00:41:20.465]  A lot of folks, period, do that.
[00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:26.171]  Specifically, I'm not trying to pooh-pooh what you're saying, but where's this story going?
[00:41:26.191 --> 00:41:31.216]  I just saw a lot of the equipment come up missing.
[00:41:32.577 --> 00:41:36.681]  Oh, well, I mean, there's billions and billions of years stolen by the Pentagon alone, just in equipment.
[00:41:38.015 --> 00:41:38.656]  Hello Alex, how are you today?
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:09.781]  Interesting thing.
[00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:19.668]  You're always asking people that listen to you how to fight this thing with nonviolent uses.
[00:42:20.629 --> 00:42:26.534]  And I think that one of the best ways is logic and using their own words against them.
[00:42:26.734 --> 00:42:32.959]  And I refer to an article on your site today about trade a gun for a rose.
[00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:34.500]  I'm sure you're familiar with it.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.641]  Yeah, I have it here right in front of me.
[00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:36.902]  Let me give people the headline.
[00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:41.114]  Trade a gun for a rose in South Carolina on Valentine's Day.
[00:42:41.174 --> 00:42:45.458]  This is done to have the news images of people handing in guns.
[00:42:45.558 --> 00:42:46.139]  Beautiful.
[00:42:46.399 --> 00:42:53.425]  To semantically train them to turn their guns in and to have the idea that guns are dirty and guns are bad.
[00:42:53.466 --> 00:42:57.329]  They have the police saying this and they have these gun buybacks everywhere.
[00:42:57.729 --> 00:43:00.292]  Now here is my point, Alex.
[00:43:01.468 --> 00:43:13.812]  Logically speaking, if you read the article, which I'm sure most of the listeners have, it was about, okay, quote, a handgun was worth a $100 gift card while the rifle or shotgun netted $50.
[00:43:14.933 --> 00:43:15.493]  Here it is.
[00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:16.693]  This is the key.
[00:43:17.153 --> 00:43:17.513]  Stay there.
[00:43:17.533 --> 00:43:18.994]  We'll come back to you after the break, okay?
[00:43:19.094 --> 00:43:19.734]  Okay, please.
[00:43:19.874 --> 00:43:20.514]  Put you on hold.
[00:43:20.554 --> 00:43:22.255]  We'll come back to Lindsey after the break.
[00:43:23.263 --> 00:43:25.428]  Yeah, they're getting you ready for gun confiscation.
[00:43:25.448 --> 00:43:27.813]  They're threatening the police that it's all kosher and acceptable.
[00:43:28.294 --> 00:43:29.076]  They want your guns.
[00:43:29.116 --> 00:43:30.459]  They want you to be their slave.
[00:43:30.519 --> 00:43:31.040]  It's that simple.
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.844]  They can't stand the fact you're free and independent.
[00:43:34.088 --> 00:43:36.410]  What will you do when the economy collapses?
[00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:39.392]  Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.
[00:43:39.572 --> 00:43:41.253]  How will you feed your family?
[00:43:41.413 --> 00:43:48.558]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[00:43:48.738 --> 00:43:56.083]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.

[00:44:04.028 --> 00:44:04.608]  I think so.
[00:44:33.977 --> 00:44:37.261]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.

[00:45:21.636 --> 00:45:25.860]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:30.945]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:45:45.399 --> 00:45:50.484]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:45:50.784 --> 00:45:56.369]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:45:56.689 --> 00:46:02.675]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:46:02.915 --> 00:46:06.418]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:46:06.678 --> 00:46:11.220]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.280]  Do your part.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.821]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.

[00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:36.351]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:46:36.791 --> 00:46:40.093]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:46:40.573 --> 00:46:46.537]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:46:46.897 --> 00:46:51.040]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:57.263]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:46:57.543 --> 00:47:00.685]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:47:00.965 --> 00:47:01.626]  Run some pumps.
[00:47:02.026 --> 00:47:05.370]  Shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:11.536]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:47:11.836 --> 00:47:16.461]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with the solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:47:16.801 --> 00:47:20.765]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:47:21.145 --> 00:47:21.646]  That's my
[00:47:21.786 --> 00:47:22.546]  Alright, we are back.
[00:47:22.586 --> 00:47:23.747]  Let's go back to Lindsey in Idaho.
[00:47:23.767 --> 00:47:24.927]  He was bringing up this article.
[00:47:53.251 --> 00:47:55.214]  And I see these every week all over the country.
[00:47:55.254 --> 00:48:00.804]  They have gun buybacks and it's normally old women whose husband has died.
[00:48:01.659 --> 00:48:02.580]  And they'll go turn in.
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.383]  I've seen cases where it's these fine carved English shotguns.
[00:48:06.423 --> 00:48:09.286]  They might be worth $10,000 in some cases.
[00:48:09.766 --> 00:48:12.089]  And they get $50, $100, a gift card.
[00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:13.290]  It's dirty.
[00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:13.710]  It's bad.
[00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:14.751]  They'll show them the news.
[00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:16.092]  Get rid of it.
[00:48:16.292 --> 00:48:17.153]  Please, it's devilish.
[00:48:17.273 --> 00:48:18.514]  The officer's like, absolutely.
[00:48:18.574 --> 00:48:19.976]  I'll get rid of that evil thing for you, ma'am.
[00:48:19.996 --> 00:48:23.118]  And they are caught many times selling them out the back door of the police station.
[00:48:23.138 --> 00:48:24.340]  A lot of police have been in trouble for that.
[00:48:28.177 --> 00:48:35.298]  But the women feel safe, predominantly, mainly women, with the cops with handguns on their sides.
[00:48:35.838 --> 00:48:39.899]  See, it's safe when government has a gun, but not when a slave has it.
[00:48:40.499 --> 00:48:44.520]  This is the domestication, the institutionalization of the population.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:52.721]  They have billboards up all over the country for at least a decade that show a picture of a revolver pointed at you threateningly and it says, report illegal guns.
[00:48:53.502 --> 00:48:55.642]  And then people looking at that think all guns are illegal.
[00:48:56.277 --> 00:48:58.198]  This is a perception battle, when they're not.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.782]  And it's been done by design, and it's the same thing here with these gun buybacks.
[00:49:03.842 --> 00:49:11.847]  The news image of people lined up, turning guns in, and they say in the article, we're doing background checks and ballistics on all the guns, and we're going to come arrest you if anything illegal's been done with them.
[00:49:12.248 --> 00:49:14.789]  I mean, what idiot would go incriminate themselves and do this?
[00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:17.431]  To have themselves registered and turn it in?
[00:49:18.552 --> 00:49:20.353]  But look, don't worry criminals and government.
[00:49:20.853 --> 00:49:24.976]  Record gun sales, record ammo sales, they're selling out of ammo and guns everywhere now.
[00:49:25.885 --> 00:49:30.749]  We are on to you, so you may have some idiots that'll come turn the guns into you.
[00:49:31.569 --> 00:49:32.670]  As if there's something evil.
[00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.571]  But the public knows the truth.
[00:49:34.611 --> 00:49:35.992]  They know Hitler was for gun control.
[00:49:36.012 --> 00:49:38.854]  They know the first gun control laws of this nation were against black people.
[00:49:39.275 --> 00:49:44.198]  They know that criminal governments, as the Founding Fathers said, want your guns.
[00:49:45.199 --> 00:49:48.381]  But go ahead and make your point there, Lindsey.
[00:49:49.168 --> 00:49:52.450]  Okay, Alex, here's the logic in the rest of the article.
[00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:58.572]  As it said, one man turned in six handguns worth $600 in gift cards.
[00:49:59.093 --> 00:50:03.895]  Now, quickly, there was no amnesty for those turning in guns.
[00:50:03.995 --> 00:50:06.536]  The weapons were checked to see if they were stolen.
[00:50:06.956 --> 00:50:08.057]  And then I love this part.
[00:50:08.077 --> 00:50:11.238]  Names and addresses were jotted down.
[00:50:11.318 --> 00:50:14.199]  Makes it sound kind of, eh, you know, no big deal.
[00:50:14.259 --> 00:50:14.960]  Jotted down.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.441]  Here is my point.
[00:50:18.633 --> 00:50:37.300]  This guy that turns in six handguns in South Carolina, if you want to debunk Associated Press and whoever wrote this article and about all this, this guy ought to be on the front page news as the best American in the country!
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.701]  He turned in six handguns!
[00:50:41.342 --> 00:50:42.002]  Who is he?
[00:50:42.342 --> 00:50:46.404]  My point being, I think this is PSYOP.
[00:50:47.171 --> 00:50:49.473]  I don't think this person exists.
[00:50:49.613 --> 00:51:06.824]  Sir, sir, in 1998, the Texas legislature was in session, it made national news, we're in there and they bring up these two young black men to say we're gangbangers, we're dangerous, you need to ban the guns, it was playing race card.
[00:51:06.844 --> 00:51:13.148]  Then we caught the guy who had brought them there, paying them off, and it
[00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:16.091]  Came out in the Statesman, it was illegal.
[00:51:16.471 --> 00:51:17.872]  The legislature had to admit it.
[00:51:18.512 --> 00:51:20.793]  Violated house ethics rules.
[00:51:21.273 --> 00:51:26.195]  The whole point is that was staged and yes, I guarantee you this was handgun control incorporated.
[00:51:26.415 --> 00:51:30.197]  They've been caught at other events staging these because nobody's really showing up.
[00:51:30.217 --> 00:51:32.998]  All I'm saying Alex is simply this.
[00:51:33.638 --> 00:51:35.439]  If anybody was to write in
[00:51:36.218 --> 00:51:39.039]  To South Carolina newspaper AP, I don't care.
[00:51:39.579 --> 00:51:41.040]  And say, this guy is great.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.040]  We need his name.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.861]  We want to put him on the front page.
[00:51:44.321 --> 00:51:50.644]  I would be willing to bet what's left of my money that he doesn't exist.
[00:51:50.844 --> 00:51:51.424]  Absolutely.
[00:51:51.464 --> 00:51:52.465]  There's no doubt.
[00:51:53.045 --> 00:51:55.406]  And that's meant to prime the pump with news cameras.
[00:51:55.426 --> 00:51:56.606]  They have this on TV too.
[00:51:57.927 --> 00:52:05.170]  So old ladies then get into the PAC mentality, the herd mentality, the sheep mentality, and run down and turn their guns in.
[00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:12.315]  It's absolutely unbelievable, and again, AP... All I'm saying, Alex, is simply this.
[00:52:12.756 --> 00:52:28.708]  If people would read what is even given to them by the AP, and then dissect it, and then logically say, okay, let's go at it this way, that is a good way to fight the disinformation that's coming down in this day and time.
[00:52:28.988 --> 00:52:53.995]  No, I agree, there was a big professor up at the University of Chicago about six years ago who wrote a big book saying the colonies were anti-gun, 5% of people owned rifles, it wasn't a pro-gun culture, the war wasn't started over guns, he used fake census and church records of births, and then we got on air and said this is fake, this is a lie, we know the history, and people did an investigation, it turned out it was all lies, and he was kicked out and lost his tenure.
[00:52:55.495 --> 00:52:58.296]  And absolutely, that's how they operate, is deception.
[00:52:59.065 --> 00:52:59.986]  That's their favorite tool.
[00:53:00.026 --> 00:53:01.547]  Look, I would have gotten to this story.
[00:53:01.867 --> 00:53:04.469]  Notice it was in my stack, but I wasn't going to get to it because I don't have time.
[00:53:05.009 --> 00:53:07.831]  I've got too many news stories, too many calls, too much to cover.
[00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.453]  But yes, I have stacks of similar news.
[00:53:10.753 --> 00:53:13.475]  You notice you called about it and I had it in the stack every day.
[00:53:13.515 --> 00:53:14.916]  But understand, it creates the perception.
[00:53:14.956 --> 00:53:17.417]  The article's written like, ooh, their names were written down.
[00:53:17.477 --> 00:53:18.598]  Ooh, they might get in trouble.
[00:53:19.059 --> 00:53:21.580]  As if the guns were illegal, and that's why they were turning them in.
[00:53:22.921 --> 00:53:24.923]  As if this, the average handgun probably costs 400 bucks.
[00:53:26.465 --> 00:53:28.926]  This guy could have gone and made thousands off these six guns.
[00:53:30.147 --> 00:53:30.607]  Selling them.
[00:53:31.127 --> 00:53:32.187]  Selling them to a gun dealer.
[00:53:32.668 --> 00:53:33.408]  Totally legal.
[00:53:34.989 --> 00:53:35.729]  But it didn't happen.
[00:53:35.769 --> 00:53:36.990]  Let's go to Pat in Canada.
[00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.730]  Pat, you're on the air.
[00:53:39.771 --> 00:53:40.351]  Go ahead, Pat.
[00:53:43.192 --> 00:53:46.894]  Okay, let's talk to Tripped in Wisconsin.
[00:53:47.474 --> 00:53:48.114]  You're on the air.
[00:53:49.215 --> 00:53:50.335]  Oh, that was the wrong caller.
[00:53:51.196 --> 00:53:52.016]  Now Tripped, go ahead.
[00:53:52.936 --> 00:53:53.096]  Alex?
[00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:53.617]  Yes.
[00:53:53.637 --> 00:53:54.597]  How are you doing?
[00:53:54.777 --> 00:53:55.638]  Good.
[00:53:55.818 --> 00:54:01.863]  I originally called in to talk about the internet too, but the gun thing brought up an interesting point.
[00:54:03.644 --> 00:54:09.848]  When they were taking these guns away in South Carolina, it reminded me of the UK where they took all the guns away.
[00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:17.356]  Well, in the UK, in the UK, first for decades, they had gun buybacks and gun amnesty before they were illegal.
[00:54:17.436 --> 00:54:23.743]  It creates the perception, then they registered them, then they confiscated them, just like they've started in Canada.
[00:54:23.763 --> 00:54:24.103]  Go ahead.
[00:54:24.504 --> 00:54:24.684]  Right.
[00:54:25.224 --> 00:54:31.691]  And it was funny, because I was watching a video, Britain's warning to Americans, where all these Britons are saying,
[00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:33.432]  Please learn from our mistakes.
[00:54:33.472 --> 00:54:34.693]  Don't let them do this to you.
[00:54:35.233 --> 00:54:39.395]  We're trying our best to reverse it, but once it's done, it's almost impossible to reverse.
[00:54:39.895 --> 00:54:41.896]  I go back and check the video a few days ago.
[00:54:41.957 --> 00:54:47.580]  It says YouTube had to pull this video because the NRA requested that it be taken down.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.181]  I just thought that was pretty funny.
[00:54:50.341 --> 00:54:50.741]  That's right.
[00:54:50.781 --> 00:54:53.363]  The NRA is a pro-gun control group.
[00:54:54.163 --> 00:54:56.024]  And more and more of that's coming out.
[00:54:56.084 --> 00:54:58.746]  They pushed the 68 Gun Control Act and got it passed.
[00:54:59.166 --> 00:55:00.887]  They were set up by the federal government in 1870.
[00:55:00.927 --> 00:55:04.969]  They're there to neutralize and control gun owners.
[00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.211]  And now, Gunners of America is now on record.
[00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:11.813]  The NRA is a pro-gun control group, but they pose like they're pro-gun.
[00:55:13.274 --> 00:55:16.256]  Look, bottom line, the criminals in government are criminals.
[00:55:16.296 --> 00:55:17.677]  They're looting, they're robbing you.
[00:55:17.737 --> 00:55:19.698]  We're in offshore bank receivership.
[00:55:20.385 --> 00:55:25.690]  One of the first things the IMF and World Bank do when they take over a third world nation is order them to confiscate the guns.
[00:55:26.391 --> 00:55:27.352]  If they want more loans.
[00:55:27.832 --> 00:55:29.674]  That's what's happening here in the United States.
[00:55:29.814 --> 00:55:30.495]  It's happening.
[00:55:30.795 --> 00:55:33.898]  They've introduced bills to ban all semi-automatic rifles.
[00:55:35.059 --> 00:55:36.441]  All semi-automatic handguns.
[00:55:36.501 --> 00:55:37.382]  It's introduced.
[00:55:37.462 --> 00:55:38.062]  It's happening.
[00:55:38.723 --> 00:55:40.865]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Pennsylvania.
[00:55:40.925 --> 00:55:41.666]  Bill, you're on the air.
[00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:43.751]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:55:43.791 --> 00:55:44.652]  You're a great American.
[00:55:45.032 --> 00:55:47.334]  Hey, I wanted to tell you two things.
[00:55:47.895 --> 00:56:00.087]  I've been changing a lot of people's minds about 9-11 just by showing them now the articles about NIST and building number 7 versus the Beijing hotel that burned.
[00:56:00.726 --> 00:56:08.710]  And if you've been watching CNN, they've been showing really, really close pictures of the ground of the plane that fell in Buffalo, and you can see the tail section.
[00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:18.615]  The NTSB guy came out and said that we found the engines, the wings, and everything, and they showed it when it was on fire and how it all flamed up.
[00:56:19.195 --> 00:56:30.000]  Well, I'm showing people that picture and that video, and then I show them the video in Pennsylvania that the plane hit the ground, and obviously it was nothing but a hole, and all that wood should have been torched.
[00:56:30.803 --> 00:56:31.844]  Well let me add something.
[00:56:32.464 --> 00:56:34.506]  It's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:56:35.226 --> 00:56:44.792]  I interviewed the firefighters four years ago when they were in the Philadelphia Daily News saying they found three of the four black boxes from the planes that hit Tower 1 and 2.
[00:56:45.312 --> 00:56:49.055]  The FBI grabbed the boxes, declared national security, that was in the news.
[00:56:49.515 --> 00:56:55.679]  Now several federal agencies have come out and said yes we found the boxes and we don't know why the FBI won't release them.
[00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.901]  That was mainstream news on Friday.
[00:56:58.381 --> 00:56:59.642]  Steve Watson did a story about it.
[00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:01.884]  Paul Watson did a story about it at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:02.164 --> 00:57:05.047]  So the point is, it is an inside job, folks.
[00:57:06.808 --> 00:57:07.989]  Most definitely, Alex.
[00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:21.481]  And I tell you right now, you have one of the greatest shows, and you have the greatest listening group out there, and I think it's time that we organize and march to Washington and sit on their porch and say, hey, it's time for answers.
[00:57:22.153 --> 00:57:22.633]  Thanks a lot.
[00:57:23.073 --> 00:57:24.234]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:25.895]  Well, the American people can't march.
[00:57:25.935 --> 00:57:27.455]  Their savior Obama's here.
[00:57:27.475 --> 00:57:29.116]  He's going to save us from everything Bush did.
[00:57:29.716 --> 00:57:32.737]  Meanwhile, I've never seen this many lobbyists put into power.
[00:57:33.198 --> 00:57:38.720]  He swore, he pledged, no lobbyists, or no one that's given me donations in power positions.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:43.182]  And I'm making the Obama deception film right now, and I had too many examples.
[00:57:43.732 --> 00:57:52.079]  I only give like 10, every major cabinet position, not just lobbyists, top lobbyists, top Raytheon, top Goldman Sachs.
[00:57:52.979 --> 00:57:59.985]  If they're over healthcare, Health and Human Services, they're the former top lobbyists for the big hospitals or the big drug companies.
[00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:04.348]  And it'll be 10, 20, 30, 40 deep where every position is lobbyists.
[00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:07.063]  He said he was going to get us out of Iraq in six months.
[00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:07.243]  Then 16.
[00:58:07.744 --> 00:58:08.024]  Now it's 23.
[00:58:08.604 --> 00:58:09.545]  Now he says maybe never.
[00:58:09.825 --> 00:58:11.387]  Doubling the troops in Afghanistan.
[00:58:11.427 --> 00:58:12.087]  Lied about that.
[00:58:12.368 --> 00:58:13.589]  Said he did NAFTA and GATT.
[00:58:13.629 --> 00:58:15.450]  Now says he's going to expand NAFTA and GATT.
[00:58:15.971 --> 00:58:19.154]  I mean the lies go on and on and on and on.
[00:58:19.494 --> 00:58:20.695]  But he smiles nice.
[00:58:20.975 --> 00:58:22.056]  He tells you he loves you.
[00:58:23.077 --> 00:58:23.818]  Oh my goodness.
[00:58:24.835 --> 00:58:28.838]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson introducing a new way to listen to GCN on your cell phone.

[00:58:53.806 --> 00:58:57.408]  Are taxes, food, energy, housing, medical, forcing Americans into poverty?
[00:58:57.549 --> 00:59:03.492]  Is free enterprise flawed, or is our monetary system forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:59:03.593 --> 00:59:06.034]  The answers are in Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:59:06.134 --> 00:59:09.617]  Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about the Fed and central banking.
[00:59:09.737 --> 00:59:10.577]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:59:10.617 --> 00:59:11.278]  I will give a U.S.

[00:59:32.132 --> 00:59:43.580]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:49.624]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:59:49.684 --> 00:59:50.164]  I think so.

[01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:30.370]  The council approves a ban on feeding deer within... Thank you for listening to GCA.

[01:00:38.613 --> 01:00:40.034]  IRN USA Radio News.
[01:00:40.334 --> 01:00:41.155]  I'm Jody Jordan.
[01:00:41.535 --> 01:00:48.460]  President Barack Obama will sign his 787 billion economic stimulus bill into law this Tuesday in Denver.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:56.966]  This morning, I'm pleased to say that after a lively debate full of healthy differences of opinion, we've delivered real and tangible progress for the American people.
[01:00:57.086 --> 01:00:58.847]  It's a big victory for the new president.
[01:00:59.268 --> 01:01:05.172]  Democrats say the money will create millions of good-paying jobs and help keep families in crisis afloat.
[01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:08.615]  China isn't too happy about parts of the U.S.
[01:01:08.635 --> 01:01:13.458]  stimulus package that favors the use of American goods to help rebuild the economy.
[01:01:14.118 --> 01:01:22.303]  An editorial by China's official news agency calls the bill poison that will hurt efforts to solve the global financial crisis.
[01:01:23.223 --> 01:01:30.648]  And the grim task of removing the bodies of the victims killed in Thursday's plane crash outside Buffalo, New York continues today.
[01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:33.750]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[01:01:35.643 --> 01:01:38.704]  Men and women, if you've got 10 to 30 pounds or more to lose, please listen carefully.
[01:01:38.985 --> 01:01:40.605]  Guys, many of us tend to overeat.
[01:01:40.665 --> 01:01:42.866]  We eat too much red meat, fast foods and processed foods.
[01:01:43.086 --> 01:01:45.467]  This keeps the belly flabby and keeps our bodies overweight.
[01:01:45.608 --> 01:01:47.488]  Ladies, have you ever said, I feel fat today?
[01:01:47.768 --> 01:01:48.909]  Or do you have this bloated feeling?
[01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:52.090]  And how many of you have been trying to lose the same 10 to 20 pounds for years?
[01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.872]  There's a healthy and faster way to lose weight than any diet pill.
[01:01:54.972 --> 01:02:04.396]  It's called EverCleanse, a clinically proven weight loss and detox formula that helps you lose weight and get rid of the 5 to 25 pounds of waste that some experts say is trapped to the colon walls like spackle or paste.
[01:02:04.756 --> 01:02:06.817]  Two weeks of EverCleanse may be equal to months of dieting.
[01:02:07.077 --> 01:02:07.657]  It's simple too.
[01:02:07.837 --> 01:02:10.097]  Natural, tasteless crystals that dissolve in any food or beverage.

[01:02:41.596 --> 01:02:44.559]  More than 180 people were killed and some 1,800 homes destroyed.
[01:02:46.804 --> 01:02:47.104]  U.S.
[01:02:47.144 --> 01:02:53.907]  National Park Service spokesman Doug Alexander tells the Australian counterparts that American firefighters want to help.
[01:02:54.147 --> 01:02:55.447]  We've heard that they're extremely bad.
[01:02:55.467 --> 01:03:03.150]  You've had a terrible loss of light, a fantastic fire spread, cities burned.
[01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:09.152]  You know, we've heard a lot in the last two weeks, so it's been good.
[01:03:09.232 --> 01:03:11.313]  And I can understand your folks are fatigued.
[01:03:13.101 --> 01:03:14.202]  So that's why we're here to help.
[01:03:14.322 --> 01:03:23.468]  And leftover damage from Hurricane Ike didn't keep hundreds of revelers from gathering in Galveston, Texas yesterday to celebrate an annual Mardi Gras tradition.

[01:04:05.367 --> 01:04:15.348]  Northern Illinois University has held a candlelight vigil to mark one year since a suicidal gunman shot and killed five students before turning the gun on himself.
[01:04:16.195 --> 01:04:17.235]  Here's Rupa Chinoy.
[01:04:17.255 --> 01:04:30.279]  It began with the memorial service and it was kind of in a darkened auditorium and there were hundreds of people there and it was very interesting to see this kind of community that was formed from the tragedy kind of reunite.
[01:04:30.559 --> 01:04:35.241]  NIU is also planning a commemoration in a wreath-laying for the one-year anniversary.
[01:04:35.981 --> 01:04:39.302]  Some Republicans in the Illinois House want Democratic U.S.
[01:04:39.322 --> 01:04:42.083]  Senator Roland Burress investigated for perjury.
[01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:43.932]  Here's John O'Connor.
[01:04:44.112 --> 01:04:54.478]  Senator Burris now says that he was approached by Robert Blagojevich, the former governor's brother and campaign chairman, to host a fundraiser for the governor.
[01:04:54.598 --> 01:05:01.042]  The disclosure yesterday is at odds with Burris' testimony to a state house impeachment committee in January.
[01:05:01.882 --> 01:05:06.825]  And negotiators for the United Auto Workers have walked out of concession talks with General Motors.
[01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:08.577]  Here's Tom Krishner.
[01:05:08.757 --> 01:05:15.919]  The GM talks broke off because of a dispute over this retiree health care trust that the company is required to pay into.
[01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:20.320]  The contract requires that GM pay billions of dollars into this trust fund.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.161]  GM wants to swap those cash payments out for GM stock.
[01:05:24.241 --> 01:05:29.302]  GM has until Tuesday to submit a plan to the government showing how it can become viable.
[01:05:30.308 --> 01:05:33.492]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.

[01:07:05.686 --> 01:07:16.310]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:19.151]  It is hour number two of this abbreviated Sunday transmission.
[01:07:19.211 --> 01:07:20.892]  I'm live four hours a day, 11 a.m.
[01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:23.553]  to 3 p.m.
[01:07:23.593 --> 01:07:24.333]  Central Standard Time.
[01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:27.134]  I come back on Sunday for an abbreviated 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:07:27.154 --> 01:07:27.955]  Central Standard Time.
[01:07:27.995 --> 01:07:28.895]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:35.793]  You know, normally I don't go with stories that aren't completely documented out in the open.
[01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:45.716]  But when I am aware separately that everything in the story has already been proven and admitted in other mainstream or government documents, then I cover it.
[01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:55.119]  Again, a year and a half, this is now three years ago, but a year and a half before it became mainstream news, I was sent secret FEMA documents from a pastor, then I got a second group of them,
[01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:59.262]  FEMA found out which particular pastor had sent it to him.
[01:07:59.302 --> 01:08:00.123]  He went and threatened him.
[01:08:00.723 --> 01:08:04.505]  And it said that they were paying preachers, now 26,000 of them.
[01:08:05.006 --> 01:08:06.346]  This ties in with InfraGard.
[01:08:06.366 --> 01:08:11.789]  You can Google that with 20-plus thousand executives that have shoot-to-kill orders, martial law powers.
[01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:13.290]  They're expanding that.
[01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:16.192]  It's part of continuity of government infrastructure protection.
[01:08:16.252 --> 01:08:20.194]  And in the documents it says, this is how you teach your flock to take forced inoculations.
[01:08:20.574 --> 01:08:21.635]  To go to the FEMA camp.
[01:08:22.595 --> 01:08:23.936]  To follow the orders of troops.
[01:08:24.336 --> 01:08:25.477]  To turn their firearms in.
[01:08:26.264 --> 01:08:33.409]  Now that's been on mainstream TV and radio and in government documents and FEMA now admits it because we exposed it and they had to put their spin on it.
[01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:46.358]  But it's now mainstream news and it's mainstream news they're going to put, are putting 20,000 regular army troops to patrol American streets and they're going to use Marines and that's now in the news that they're suddenly at DUI checkpoints and car wrecks for PR.
[01:08:46.638 --> 01:08:48.019]  They're unveiling it under PR.
[01:08:48.039 --> 01:08:51.381]  You know, you're not against getting people out of wrecked cars, are you, on the highway?
[01:08:51.521 --> 01:08:52.442]  The Marines are here to help.
[01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.183]  You're not for drunk drivers, are you?
[01:08:56.875 --> 01:09:05.602]  Now I remember a Rocky Mountain News story out of Colorado in 2002 with the headline, Governor Prepares Mass Graves Incinerators for Bioweapons Release.
[01:09:06.983 --> 01:09:09.625]  And FEMA and the CDC now admit that they're prepared for this.
[01:09:10.706 --> 01:09:13.148]  Now when county officials get shocked by it,
[01:09:14.605 --> 01:09:16.867]  They don't know where to go look for the original backstory.
[01:09:16.947 --> 01:09:22.670]  Also, FEMA lies to them even though it's open source documented and they could find out if they knew where to look.
[01:09:23.111 --> 01:09:30.195]  That's like towns where they see an army base that have thousands of federal and state prisoners on it in quote forced labor.
[01:09:30.735 --> 01:09:35.258]  They sign a waiver to get a shorter sentence to then be under labor but then they're basically slaves.
[01:09:36.619 --> 01:09:40.201]  They don't know how to Google civilian inmate labor camp program.
[01:09:41.008 --> 01:09:42.669]  Civilian inmate labor camp program.
[01:09:42.689 --> 01:09:44.449]  It was secret in 86 when they started it.
[01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:49.251]  The feds were doing it to train military how to keep US prisoners that were non-military related.
[01:09:50.972 --> 01:09:54.193]  And they declassified it in 97 and we've covered it ever since.
[01:09:54.993 --> 01:09:56.614]  But neighbors who were by these camps
[01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:57.921]  I don't
[01:10:17.262 --> 01:10:28.110]  Executive orders out and PDD 51 and John Warren Defense Authorization Act and Pentagon Directives saying they're going to have camps and put people in them and they've built the camps and it's been in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:29.211]  So all that's public.
[01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:35.095]  But then city officials and county officials, when they know about it, they're then scared to talk to the public.
[01:10:35.115 --> 01:10:36.216]  Now, a reporter
[01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:38.311]  Has done the full interview.
[01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:40.592]  This reporter we're about to talk to has heard the full interview.
[01:10:40.632 --> 01:10:41.772]  He knows the county official.
[01:10:42.112 --> 01:10:44.333]  He's in Indiana on the Illinois border.
[01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:50.996]  But we're not going to release the official's name and emergency management because the person, I guess, is scared.
[01:10:51.056 --> 01:10:51.677]  We'll find out.
[01:10:51.697 --> 01:10:53.277]  But the point is, it's documented.
[01:10:53.698 --> 01:10:54.658]  We'll just leave it at that.
[01:10:55.358 --> 01:10:58.500]  And so I want to go ahead and bring up now Doug Williams.
[01:10:59.731 --> 01:11:02.513]  And Doug Williams writes for Daily Newscaster.
[01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:07.737]  The headline is, is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves in Marshall Lawn near Chicago?
[01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:09.758]  And sir, thanks for joining us.
[01:11:10.018 --> 01:11:11.980]  Well, thank you for having me on today, Mr. Jones.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.862]  I did that little bit of background for folks to understand.
[01:11:14.962 --> 01:11:17.003]  Everything that's in your article is already public.
[01:11:17.404 --> 01:11:21.146]  Just this particular case isn't, because the individual won't go public.
[01:11:21.507 --> 01:11:22.167]  Yeah, that's correct.
[01:11:22.207 --> 01:11:29.072]  You know, the people in this position, they worry about retribution and possible responses to them coming out into the open.
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.422]  I mean, you know the official, you're near the county.
[01:11:34.162 --> 01:11:36.984]  Give us any of your concerns, why you wrote the story.
[01:11:37.124 --> 01:11:38.845]  Well, I'm concerned for a couple reasons.
[01:11:39.025 --> 01:11:41.787]  One, I've been following the Marshall Law story for quite a while.
[01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:43.528]  I've been doing the research on it.
[01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:50.232]  I've looked into NSPD 51, into the other documents they have setting up FEMA camps.
[01:11:51.432 --> 01:12:01.778]  Setting up the legalities to make it possible for the federal government to co-op local county officials to execute national plans and programs.
[01:12:02.258 --> 01:12:13.404]  And one of those programs is, you know, setting up a police apparatus for controlling the population.
[01:12:18.506 --> 01:12:19.647]  Yes, sir, did we lose your phone?
[01:12:20.558 --> 01:12:21.119]  I'm back.
[01:12:21.279 --> 01:12:22.320]  There was a hiccup right there.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.181]  I understand.
[01:12:23.661 --> 01:12:25.583]  This is an important issue.
[01:12:25.623 --> 01:12:27.205]  These are real issues.
[01:12:27.265 --> 01:12:28.987]  These are things that are happening right now.
[01:12:29.327 --> 01:12:38.697]  And when someone's willing to come out and speak about their experiences with DHS and with FEMA employees, I think it's important for people to find out about that.
[01:12:38.737 --> 01:12:41.700]  So we wanted to put that out and share that with the public.
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:56.350]  Now, again, when I say every part of this article I've separately confirmed, for years we've talked about how they order county and city officials to send police, firemen, medical workers to these FEMA meetings, that it's an unfunded mandate.
[01:12:56.390 --> 01:13:02.314]  They order them to go to these classes where they scare the daylights out of them, but then are also very deceptive with them.
[01:13:02.694 --> 01:13:06.275]  And tell them, oh, this is for earthquakes and hurricanes, and then say, well, it's for terrorism.
[01:13:06.635 --> 01:13:08.516]  Then they start demonizing gun owners.
[01:13:08.836 --> 01:13:10.796]  They ask, who are the local troublemakers?
[01:13:11.176 --> 01:13:13.077]  And then the ears go up on the locals.
[01:13:13.137 --> 01:13:19.019]  In fact, I had a fireman shoot video of FEMA in Kansas City saying the Founding Fathers are bad.
[01:13:19.439 --> 01:13:21.559]  You know, we're setting this up for the people's own good.
[01:13:21.639 --> 01:13:23.540]  So, I mean, I've got a lot of this stuff.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.380]  It's really creepy.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.961]  The problem is, I'm tired of these county officials being scared to go public.
[01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:30.562]  They need to go public now, like Thomas Sanchez did.
[01:13:31.062 --> 01:13:38.045]  With me in 1999, the Kingsville emergency manager, when they told him we're getting ready for gun confiscation, that's what these military drills are for.
[01:13:38.685 --> 01:13:41.986]  Well, you know, part of the process is, you know, people are scared.
[01:13:42.006 --> 01:13:42.827]  They're intimidated.
[01:13:43.527 --> 01:13:45.488]  They're brought into these conference rooms.
[01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:49.009]  They're brought into these situations with these federal authorities.
[01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:57.713]  And, you know, they're either through oath and sometimes through contract, they are not permitted to discuss certain things.
[01:13:58.153 --> 01:14:00.534]  They will actually classify some of these meetings.
[01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:06.051]  Now, these federalization meetings, tell folks about this particular clip we're going to play after the break.
[01:14:06.771 --> 01:14:08.433]  You've heard the full clip, but this is edited.
[01:14:08.513 --> 01:14:10.094]  Yeah, I've heard the unedited clip.
[01:14:10.134 --> 01:14:11.716]  This is a municipal official.
[01:14:12.136 --> 01:14:14.498]  I'm not on the tape myself.
[01:14:14.998 --> 01:14:21.324]  I've vetted out the individual in a northwestern county here in Indiana, not too far from Chicago.
[01:14:22.304 --> 01:14:34.833]  And they were required by law to have six, they actually had more conversations and meetings, but they had to have a minimum of six meetings with federal authorities, particularly DHS and FEMA, to basically answer their questions.
[01:14:35.313 --> 01:14:42.078]  And at first it was about instituting a hazard mitigation program, and that was explained as something to prepare for tornadoes.
[01:14:42.098 --> 01:14:48.342]  Yeah, they always use something reasonable, like the Army's gonna help stop drunks on the streets, and then it's, and take guns, but go ahead.
[01:14:48.522 --> 01:14:51.483]  And that's exactly how they got him involved and got him started in it.
[01:14:51.843 --> 01:15:05.307]  And then the questions, the verbal questions, the written questionnaires, the information they wanted to know about infrastructure, telling them to plan for just unbelievable disaster scenarios that are just unrealistic for the area.
[01:15:06.247 --> 01:15:07.767]  You know, it caused concern.
[01:15:07.867 --> 01:15:09.588]  You know, what were these meetings really about?
[01:15:09.608 --> 01:15:13.389]  Because they didn't actually seem to be about preparing for tornadoes.
[01:15:14.033 --> 01:15:15.974]  And then they said, oh, it's mass graves.
[01:15:16.315 --> 01:15:17.976]  Oh, it's martial law.
[01:15:18.136 --> 01:15:21.118]  Oh, it's for 400,000 people flooding your county.
[01:15:21.218 --> 01:15:22.759]  Oh, you need hardened bunkers.
[01:15:23.239 --> 01:15:23.860]  And they said, why?
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.921]  And they said, oh, in case jets fly into them.
[01:15:26.081 --> 01:15:28.403]  And they said, no, jets were in the countryside, in cornfields.
[01:15:28.763 --> 01:15:31.285]  Well, we all know it's really to fight the American people.
[01:15:31.585 --> 01:15:43.773]  Yeah, they looked, they had a map, and they had it out on the table in one of the conferences, and asked the people there from the counties, said, you know, if we need to locate mass graves, point a good area out, where would we do that?
[01:15:48.096 --> 01:15:54.201]  Well, you know, this is the incredible thing.
[01:15:54.381 --> 01:16:02.627]  FEMA, we found the purchase orders where they bought millions in different locations around the country of these plastic coffins for mass death.
[01:16:03.585 --> 01:16:11.068]  And then, when you try to ask FEMA about it, they deny that they're really coffins, and then we can call the company up that makes them and find the purchase order for them.
[01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:14.509]  So, they're gearing up for something really big, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:15.069 --> 01:16:25.153]  We're going to talk about it more and play this clip and break it down and analyze it with a head emergency manager in a major county in Indiana on the border with Illinois and Chicago.
[01:16:25.533 --> 01:16:26.853]  It's all coming up after the break.
[01:16:26.874 --> 01:16:27.694]  Please stay with us.
[01:16:28.014 --> 01:16:30.855]  He's Doug Williams, and he writes for the Daily Newscaster.

[01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:42.415]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[01:18:59.192 --> 01:19:01.454]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:38.511]  It's time for change.
[01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:41.533]  The new president is talking about change.
[01:19:41.993 --> 01:19:43.915]  Are you talking about change?
[01:19:44.455 --> 01:19:47.117]  You know, changing your lifestyle to become more healthy?
[01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.839]  Well, here's how the staff at LifeChangeT feels.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.221]  Make the change to be healthy.
[01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:56.335]  Before your body forces you to change.
[01:19:57.036 --> 01:20:02.800]  Organ failure, sickness, chemical poisoning, toxins, and much more.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.782]  They'll force you to change for the worse.
[01:20:05.802 --> 01:20:09.785]  A willing change is much better than a change by force.

[01:20:50.125 --> 01:20:51.346]  Alright, we're back live.
[01:20:52.226 --> 01:20:54.548]  Anything else you want to say before we play this clip?
[01:20:54.568 --> 01:20:56.029]  You can come back and comment on it.
[01:20:56.049 --> 01:20:59.751]  Doug Williams with the Daily Newscaster.
[01:21:01.835 --> 01:21:03.276]  I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, what was that?
[01:21:03.376 --> 01:21:05.398]  Anything you'd like to say before we play this clip?
[01:21:05.678 --> 01:21:14.865]  You know, it's just people need to realize that these preparations are going on, and when preparations like this happen, they're not for no reason.
[01:21:15.326 --> 01:21:16.446]  That needs to be kept in mind.
[01:21:17.447 --> 01:21:19.308]  Yeah, they're doing this for a reason.
[01:21:19.348 --> 01:21:45.559]  Also, if the establishment really wanted to have true emergency preparedness, they would involve the community with the old-fashioned civil defense, but FEMA, and this is on record, we reported this the day it happened, during Katrina, it was in local news, no one believed us, but it came out in congressional testimony, and I interviewed the head of the parish at New Orleans, that's the name of the counties there, in the parish, Mr. Richard,
[01:21:46.791 --> 01:21:55.093]  On record, the feds jammed the police cell phones and then said, oh look at how the locals, 80% of the cops just walked off the job.
[01:21:55.133 --> 01:22:02.555]  They jammed their cell phones, went in, cut down the police radio lines, and then the police found out three days in and had to fix it and guard it.
[01:22:02.896 --> 01:22:07.957]  And FEMA showed up with guns in an armed standoff and wanted to cut the lines.
[01:22:08.911 --> 01:22:15.338]  And it later came out they wanted to have it be a disaster so they could use it as a, quote, laboratory to test gun confiscation.
[01:22:15.378 --> 01:22:28.591]  They then sent in the regular troops, Lair News Hour admits, and there's YouTube clips of this, that Israeli troops, Israeli contractors were used, black water was used, high and dry gun confiscation.
[01:22:30.533 --> 01:22:40.175]  FEMA is completely evil, and keeping all of this secret, and under PDD 51, Congress, they say, doesn't have any authority, when Congress is co-equal with the President!
[01:22:40.635 --> 01:22:44.876]  The covert nature of all this questioning should really be the red flag.
[01:22:45.217 --> 01:22:51.258]  If this were legitimate, it would be public, they would involve the community, it would be out in the daylight.
[01:22:52.738 --> 01:22:53.298]  Absolutely.
[01:22:53.338 --> 01:22:55.059]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:22:55.079 --> 01:22:55.479]  Here it is.
[01:22:57.947 --> 01:23:02.988]  There's some things going on here in Indiana that I'm sure people are generally unaware of.
[01:23:05.089 --> 01:23:17.052]  And I have some contacts, and I had made a contact with Superfaith to talk with him a little bit, but I'm not sure what happened.
[01:23:17.172 --> 01:23:20.693]  I think he had an ice storm down there, and I don't know if he's out of it for a while or not.
[01:23:23.157 --> 01:23:24.278]  Yeah, he's disappeared.
[01:23:24.298 --> 01:23:31.900]  No one knows what... I think he's just focusing on the family right now, but you wrote a lot of things in your email.
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:35.001]  Why don't you just go through them one at a time and break it down for us.
[01:23:35.041 --> 01:23:35.682]  What do you see?
[01:23:35.782 --> 01:23:36.382]  What's going on?
[01:23:36.402 --> 01:23:42.964]  About a year and a half to two years ago, we started being contacted by FEMA saying you've got to put some plans together.
[01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:47.386]  The first plans had to do with
[01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:52.151]  You know, the reason was avian flu.
[01:23:52.712 --> 01:23:56.334]  Now, you know, I don't know.
[01:23:56.374 --> 01:24:01.337]  My brother's a doctor and a couple hundred people around the world have died from bird flu.
[01:24:04.379 --> 01:24:08.282]  Not really a serious threat right now unless they know something that we don't.
[01:24:08.342 --> 01:24:16.367]  But the point is that we were to put together a plan to vaccinate every person in county
[01:24:17.646 --> 01:24:18.887]  Within 48 hours.
[01:24:18.907 --> 01:24:20.188]  You're kidding me.
[01:24:20.228 --> 01:24:20.468]  Wow.
[01:24:21.009 --> 01:24:23.951]  And then that plan has to be practiced two or three times.
[01:24:24.031 --> 01:24:37.362]  I mean literally we've we've gotten every police officer we can and buses and and uh volunteers and and set it up and you know logistically it's just really not possible to do.
[01:24:37.382 --> 01:24:44.688]  I mean we've we've run through this thing a hundred times and in our heads and several times during runs it's just not logistically possible but the point is
[01:24:45.468 --> 01:24:51.210]  They want to be able to back people very fast for some reason.
[01:24:52.010 --> 01:25:00.433]  It might be bird flu, but my brother is saying that bird flu really is an event right now unless they know something we don't know.
[01:25:01.833 --> 01:25:06.354]  Then the Sheriff's Department started getting long questionnaires.
[01:25:06.454 --> 01:25:07.255]  I got one myself.
[01:25:07.355 --> 01:25:08.215]  I didn't fill it out.
[01:25:09.384 --> 01:25:11.186]  And lots of questions.
[01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:15.731]  What kind of resources do we have?
[01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:16.972]  How many officers?
[01:25:17.413 --> 01:25:18.314]  What can we handle?
[01:25:18.354 --> 01:25:24.400]  What are you going to do if Chicago has an emergency and you have 400,000 people heading into your county?
[01:25:28.444 --> 01:25:30.306]  Uh, where can you put mass graves?
[01:25:30.346 --> 01:25:32.648]  We need to know spaces and mass graves.
[01:25:32.748 --> 01:25:35.029]  Can you, how many can you handle?
[01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:38.992]  Can you handle bodies from surrounding counties and those types of things?
[01:25:39.052 --> 01:25:41.815]  And we're going, what the heck are you guys talking about?
[01:25:41.855 --> 01:25:42.975]  You know, tell us what's going on.
[01:25:42.995 --> 01:25:44.717]  Hold up and nothing's going on.
[01:25:44.757 --> 01:25:47.319]  We're just, just contingency plans.
[01:25:47.579 --> 01:25:52.623]  If something ever happens, you know, we just really need to know how to handle things.
[01:25:52.703 --> 01:25:55.445]  And then I was contacted by
[01:25:56.488 --> 01:26:05.267]  Homeland Security through our what we have to do is have what is called a hazard mitigation plan.
[01:26:06.132 --> 01:26:07.213]  Alright, well that sounds good.
[01:26:07.273 --> 01:26:12.978]  And what they're saying is FEMA is saying that disasters are costing them too much money.
[01:26:12.998 --> 01:26:21.085]  So we've got to have a plan to mitigate the damage from disasters if a disaster ever happens.
[01:26:21.546 --> 01:26:29.452]  And I understand you've got New Orleans, you've got fires in California, and you've got tornadoes in Oklahoma.
[01:26:29.492 --> 01:26:30.914]  You have those things going on.
[01:26:31.534 --> 01:26:34.436]  But we're looking at them going, you know, look, we're in the middle of a cornfield.
[01:26:34.697 --> 01:26:36.478]  What kind of disasters are we talking about?
[01:26:37.439 --> 01:26:46.045]  Oh, earthquakes and, you know, fires and flooding and tornadoes.
[01:26:46.265 --> 01:26:51.169]  Okay, well, what are the real chances of those things happening to us?
[01:26:51.349 --> 01:26:54.672]  Oh, it's very rare, but still, we want to have mitigation plans.
[01:26:54.692 --> 01:26:56.313]  What kind of stuff are you talking about?
[01:26:56.513 --> 01:26:58.835]  I just had my last meeting today with them, in fact.
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:07.369]  And, you know, they're literally telling me that they want to harden our fire stations.
[01:27:09.248 --> 01:27:10.169]  What do you mean by that?
[01:27:10.269 --> 01:27:16.553]  Well, you know how when a 747 hits a nuclear reactor and just slides off of it?
[01:27:16.573 --> 01:27:18.814]  That kind of hardening we're talking about.
[01:27:18.854 --> 01:27:19.435]  What the heck?
[01:27:19.495 --> 01:27:19.975]  Oh my God!
[01:27:20.215 --> 01:27:22.337]  Well, first off, you know what I mean?
[01:27:30.502 --> 01:27:31.362]  For what reason?
[01:27:31.402 --> 01:27:36.584]  You know, if a 747 lands in the middle of town, don't worry about the whole town, forget the fire department.
[01:27:36.924 --> 01:27:38.384]  Yeah, oh God.
[01:27:38.464 --> 01:27:40.504]  Oh, you know, that's just things that happen.
[01:27:40.544 --> 01:27:43.445]  Well, you know, hardened against water, what do you think is going to happen?
[01:27:43.745 --> 01:27:46.406]  Well, we think this may be high wind.
[01:27:46.966 --> 01:27:50.327]  Well, those are two different things you're talking about there.
[01:27:50.367 --> 01:27:50.687]  You know what?
[01:27:51.628 --> 01:27:53.609]  Well, what is going on?
[01:27:55.551 --> 01:28:03.899]  So, we have to put together, and actually I went to the first two meetings, there's six mandatory meetings, that was the first two, and I said, this is a waste of time.
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:08.043]  If you don't, if you can't show, if you don't show, what's going to happen?
[01:28:08.063 --> 01:28:10.926]  Well, we don't know, but the law says you have to be involved in this.
[01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:14.850]  So, we set up this meeting today and had this final meeting.
[01:28:15.868 --> 01:28:18.510]  When we first got there, they laid this map out.
[01:28:18.570 --> 01:28:21.912]  It's like 10 feet by 5 feet of the whole county.
[01:28:22.973 --> 01:28:28.837]  And he said, we want to know every important thing in this county.
[01:28:29.738 --> 01:28:41.606]  We want to know where police departments are, where weapons are stored, hazardous material, where can we land a helicopter, where are the airports, how big of a plane can you land in those airports,
[01:28:42.266 --> 01:28:43.528]  Where are all the bridges?
[01:28:43.608 --> 01:28:45.229]  Where are all the power stations?
[01:28:45.309 --> 01:28:46.971]  Where are all the generating stations?
[01:28:47.011 --> 01:28:48.472]  Where are all the substations?
[01:28:48.893 --> 01:28:51.155]  I mean, they literally line up with everything.
[01:28:51.215 --> 01:28:56.280]  Listen, because this is, you know, I'm thinking... Alright, stay there.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.481]  Yeah, that's the kicker.
[01:28:57.501 --> 01:28:58.923]  He says it looks like martial law.
[01:28:58.943 --> 01:29:02.906]  We're going to come back, play this, finish up with our guest who has been writing about the story.
[01:29:02.926 --> 01:29:03.307]  Stay with us.
[01:29:04.818 --> 01:29:05.278]  He's there!
[01:29:05.358 --> 01:29:06.039]  Oh, you mother...
[01:29:34.156 --> 01:29:37.137]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[01:29:37.397 --> 01:29:39.418]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:29:39.738 --> 01:29:43.060]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:44.020]  Be smart.
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:44.981]  Be safe.
[01:29:45.261 --> 01:29:47.241]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:30:34.191 --> 01:30:38.774]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:30:39.095 --> 01:30:46.300]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.961]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:30:48.161 --> 01:30:52.064]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[01:30:52.304 --> 01:30:55.906]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[01:30:56.146 --> 01:31:00.229]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:02.571]  Phase One is a One World Currency.
[01:31:02.731 --> 01:31:04.612]  Which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[01:31:04.952 --> 01:31:08.714]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[01:31:09.054 --> 01:31:13.356]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.

[01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:39.512]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:33:39.632 --> 01:33:40.812]  Well, search no more.
[01:33:40.893 --> 01:33:45.176]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:45.196 --> 01:33:48.878]  Okay, let's finish the very end of that clip with this confirmed.
[01:33:49.439 --> 01:33:55.383]  Our guest again has it full-taped, the name, which county, but we're not putting it out because the county official doesn't want it out.
[01:33:55.723 --> 01:33:59.606]  Dealing with FEMA, is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves in Marshall Law near Chicago?
[01:33:59.986 --> 01:34:01.587]  Yes, they are and nationwide.
[01:34:01.847 --> 01:34:02.508]  Finish up the clip.
[01:34:03.636 --> 01:34:04.477]  We're good to go.
[01:34:18.849 --> 01:34:23.432]  Police departments are where weapons are stored, hazardous material.
[01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:24.933]  Where can we land a helicopter?
[01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:25.954]  Where are the airports?
[01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:28.736]  How big of a plane can you land in those airports?
[01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.657]  Where are all the bridges?
[01:34:30.717 --> 01:34:32.359]  Where are all the power stations?
[01:34:32.419 --> 01:34:34.080]  Where are all the generating stations?
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.601]  Where are all the substations?
[01:34:36.021 --> 01:34:38.303]  I mean, they literally want to know everything.
[01:34:38.343 --> 01:34:48.470]  Listen, I'm thinking of this, you know, and I'm thinking, man, if there was ever a martial law, this kind of information is exactly the kind of stuff they're going to want, because they're all, I mean, we're just
[01:34:51.472 --> 01:34:53.473]  Alright, so there you have it.
[01:34:53.493 --> 01:35:01.116]  I've got some points I want to make, but we're talking to the reporter that helped break the story, DH Williams, with the Daily Newscaster.
[01:35:01.136 --> 01:35:01.497]  Go ahead.
[01:35:02.357 --> 01:35:08.880]  Yeah, you know, can I share a quick anecdotal story of why this... Yeah, your phone cut out again.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:10.881]  I think you've got somebody calling you on call waiting.
[01:35:11.462 --> 01:35:12.903]  Actually, this line doesn't have call waiting.
[01:35:13.303 --> 01:35:16.825]  But can I share a quick anecdotal story why this is so important?
[01:35:17.305 --> 01:35:17.505]  Sure.
[01:35:18.683 --> 01:35:22.266]  Back in 1986, I was serving at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
[01:35:22.286 --> 01:35:26.309]  I was attached to a unit, about 20 men.
[01:35:26.329 --> 01:35:30.272]  To be in the unit, you had to have at least a secret clearance or above.
[01:35:30.332 --> 01:35:40.700]  And the reason for that is we would have secret meetings where we would go into a, in the middle of summer, go into an air-conditioned building, close the windows, close the shades.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:47.365]  We would pull out a big map, lay it out on the table, and we would talk about potential missions that may happen.
[01:35:47.925 --> 01:35:52.027]  For example, in the summer of 86, we had a map of Panama.
[01:35:52.688 --> 01:36:04.874]  What we would talk about is the location of the airports, the location of power generation, the communications location, where is the Panamanian Defense Force cadre located, where is their officer school located.
[01:36:05.395 --> 01:36:07.396]  We wanted to know about their infrastructure.
[01:36:08.531 --> 01:36:14.978]  Well, three years later, just before Christmas, that information was put into use when Panama was invaded.
[01:36:15.138 --> 01:36:16.559]  And they never told you that was a plan.
[01:36:16.599 --> 01:36:18.481]  They said it was just an exercise.
[01:36:18.641 --> 01:36:24.908]  All we knew is that it was for Panama because we had a map, we had locations, we had names, but they do not get into specifics.
[01:36:24.948 --> 01:36:26.049]  They do not... Let me stop you.
[01:36:26.169 --> 01:36:26.910]  I was interviewing...
[01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:32.732]  Representative Shea out of Oregon this week, and he's all aware of the martial law.
[01:36:32.772 --> 01:36:33.772]  He was also in the Army.
[01:36:34.193 --> 01:36:42.516]  He's aware of the plan and the FEMA camps, and anybody who's had this training can see what it is, but we don't even have to sit there and read between the lines.
[01:36:42.856 --> 01:36:51.039]  FEMA admits they're preparing to take over the states, that the governors have no power for total martial law, and that was my point.
[01:36:51.159 --> 01:36:52.540]  In fact, I have a bunch of them here.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.640]  I want to go through them with you quickly.
[01:36:54.514 --> 01:36:55.275]  Four shots.
[01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:58.377]  They admit they have a plan for four shots for the entire population.
[01:36:58.397 --> 01:37:04.021]  They tried five years ago to make all first responders take the smallpox shots to get them ready to nationally force it.
[01:37:04.041 --> 01:37:05.642]  They refused, so that program fell apart.
[01:37:05.962 --> 01:37:10.485]  They've trained police nationwide to use buses for forced roundups for those on the red list.
[01:37:10.726 --> 01:37:11.566]  That's part of the training.
[01:37:13.167 --> 01:37:21.332]  They're telling, and I've talked to city officials, higher up they tell them, yes, we're preparing for war with the American people during rebellion when they find out foreign banks have taken over.
[01:37:21.652 --> 01:37:24.373]  That's why they're building these bunkers all over the nation.
[01:37:24.413 --> 01:37:28.336]  That's why they said, we want you to harden these city locations.
[01:37:29.256 --> 01:37:45.226]  Back during urban warfare drills in Texas and all over the country that we went to, they would practice taking over the city halls, the police stations, the governor's mansion, the state capitals, and they even admitted it was for the United States.
[01:37:45.246 --> 01:37:46.267]  So I videotaped that.
[01:37:46.327 --> 01:37:48.608]  I know they've been quietly preparing forever.
[01:37:48.948 --> 01:37:49.769]  So there's that.
[01:37:50.349 --> 01:37:51.310]  Please comment on that.
[01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:53.151]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:37:53.391 --> 01:37:58.915]  All any unit needs is the information that's being collected from these county officials.
[01:38:00.175 --> 01:38:02.897]  You know, 1967, Detroit, there was a riot.
[01:38:03.778 --> 01:38:08.561]  People think it's odd or unusual for the military to be brought in, but 1967, I think I said Abram, 67,
[01:38:11.222 --> 01:38:14.184]  The 82nd Airborne went into Detroit to quell a riot.
[01:38:15.164 --> 01:38:16.925]  The military does do these things.
[01:38:17.746 --> 01:38:18.927]  It can happen here.
[01:38:19.327 --> 01:38:22.128]  And all they need is the information that's being gathered.
[01:38:22.148 --> 01:38:24.970]  But this is being done in conjunction for gun confiscation.
[01:38:27.371 --> 01:38:28.032]  That's the point.
[01:38:28.312 --> 01:38:29.192]  Let me continue with these.
[01:38:31.559 --> 01:38:38.504]  They also are telling all these local counties that everybody has to have FEMA training to deal with IEDs or improvised explosive devices on roadsides.
[01:38:38.524 --> 01:38:40.746]  Well, I can tell you a little something about that as well.
[01:38:40.806 --> 01:38:42.847]  That is apparently a big concern.
[01:38:42.867 --> 01:38:44.749]  I have friends that are in law enforcement.
[01:38:45.289 --> 01:38:49.112]  Over a year ago, a large group was taken down to New Orleans.
[01:38:50.507 --> 01:38:50.947]  Yeah.
[01:39:12.492 --> 01:39:13.713]  Yeah, let me expand on that.
[01:39:13.753 --> 01:39:14.733]  That's another lie.
[01:39:15.094 --> 01:39:16.414]  I have to know what this is really for.
[01:39:16.434 --> 01:39:23.679]  They use the Ordnance Disposal Units to first get rid of posse commentatus in the major states.
[01:39:23.719 --> 01:39:28.902]  Here in Texas, we caught Army, regular Army, checkpoints searching cars all over I-35.
[01:39:29.042 --> 01:39:30.322]  It's in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:40.599]  Again, just like they've now announced in the Army Times, oh, the Army's going to help at car wrecks, that's to get the public used to having the Army on their streets with something that sounds reasonable.
[01:39:40.919 --> 01:39:51.970]  To federalize local police, they started out in the late 80s claiming it was for secret IED or bomb removal, but then we got secret documents that are now public.
[01:39:52.546 --> 01:39:56.229]  We got it when the FBI screwed up at a checkpoint and said, here's a press release, idiot, get out of here.
[01:39:56.249 --> 01:39:59.331]  And under it, stapled, was the secret not for distribution.
[01:39:59.351 --> 01:40:00.372]  It's up on my website.
[01:40:00.412 --> 01:40:02.854]  It's in Police State 2 The Takeover and Road to Tyranny.
[01:40:03.174 --> 01:40:13.122]  And it said, we're here for warrant service, gun confiscation, whatever you need, operating in 1998, already in 77 Texas counties.
[01:40:13.142 --> 01:40:13.803]  Now let me expand.
[01:40:14.543 --> 01:40:23.988]  That's just how they get the local police ready to work with the military and teach them that it's not just Al Qaeda, it's black people, it's white people, it's Americans.
[01:40:24.008 --> 01:40:24.849]  Do you see the PSYOP?
[01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:26.750]  Absolutely, and that's what they're doing.
[01:40:27.170 --> 01:40:30.072]  They're saying it's Americans coming back, it's soldiers, it's veterans.
[01:40:30.872 --> 01:40:34.154]  They're creating the us versus them scenario.
[01:40:35.395 --> 01:40:39.037]  The us being anybody that's a police officer and them being the rest of us.
[01:40:39.737 --> 01:40:55.869]  Now, they're also, more importantly in all this urban warfare training and now FEMA takeover communications, they're identifying what county and city officials are dumb and will work with them, what county and city officials are criminals that want to know what's going on and want to join the team, and they're finding out who's going to resist them.
[01:40:56.209 --> 01:40:56.990]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:57.010 --> 01:40:58.210]  It's basic recruiting ops.
[01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:03.134]  I mean, any intelligence organization, that's, you know, one of the basic ways to recruit people.
[01:41:03.314 --> 01:41:06.296]  Did you ever hear about how I interviewed the San Antonio police chief?
[01:41:06.616 --> 01:41:09.458]  How he wouldn't let them do that in San Antonio, so they brought in bags of cash?
[01:41:10.319 --> 01:41:10.539]  No.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.441]  Yeah, that's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:13.141]  You gotta see it.
[01:41:13.841 --> 01:41:14.842]  I'm not surprised.
[01:41:14.922 --> 01:41:19.105]  I mean, you know, people are compromised constantly.
[01:41:19.165 --> 01:41:19.966]  Money will do that.
[01:41:20.126 --> 01:41:28.392]  Well, this is the same way for, as you know, it's now in a History Channel piece narrated by Charlton Heston that came out about ten years ago.
[01:41:28.912 --> 01:41:42.616]  For two years they were covertly buying off local officials and doing the same thing and doing drills in Panama, the supposed ally, covertly just to desensitize the Panamanian defense forces so when the real invasion happened they would stand down.
[01:41:42.957 --> 01:41:43.637]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:41:43.677 --> 01:41:45.477]  I mean, there's so much that goes on.
[01:41:45.978 --> 01:41:47.018]  Here's something to consider.
[01:41:47.058 --> 01:41:56.201]  When you're in the military and you're flying from, let's say, Fort Bragg, from Pope Air Force Base attached to Fort Bragg, you go down to Panama, this is in Noriega's days,
[01:41:56.821 --> 01:42:02.764]  You go down to Panama, you get off the plane, you spend your time in Panama, and then when you return home, you get back on the plane.
[01:42:02.784 --> 01:42:03.664]  There's no customs.
[01:42:04.325 --> 01:42:05.965]  There's no one there to stop you or check you.
[01:42:05.985 --> 01:42:12.768]  You get on the plane, you fly back to Fort Bragg, you get off the plane, and the next thing you know, you're in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
[01:42:12.848 --> 01:42:16.270]  That's why they use the dead bodies in Vietnam packed full of cocaine on record.
[01:42:17.054 --> 01:42:17.634]  That's correct.
[01:42:17.774 --> 01:42:20.356]  Alright, continuing with my points I want you to comment on.
[01:42:20.956 --> 01:42:22.517]  They're saying it's mandatory meetings.
[01:42:22.837 --> 01:42:26.499]  That trains them to be under federal control and federal orders.
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:29.601]  Yeah, it's an act of submission.
[01:42:29.641 --> 01:42:31.302]  They're saying you're going to submit right up front.
[01:42:31.822 --> 01:42:32.863]  This is what we're going to do.
[01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:36.231]  And if you balk about it, you know, things are not going to be good for you.
[01:42:36.251 --> 01:42:37.311]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:42:37.411 --> 01:42:46.815]  I talked to former Special Forces colonels, generals, the former head of all of Special Forces on air has said they're preparing for martial law.
[01:42:47.235 --> 01:42:51.016]  I can have police chiefs, I can have them all on, the public still sucks their thumb.
[01:42:51.116 --> 01:42:54.458]  You were obviously in Special Forces, you're saying it, Bragg, I didn't know that.
[01:42:54.758 --> 01:43:01.200]  What are they going to do about the tens of millions of vets who know what this is and recognize what it is and who aren't going to go along with it?
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:05.084]  You know, I don't have the exact number, exactly what's going to happen, but here's what I think.
[01:43:06.225 --> 01:43:12.291]  Unfortunately, there's going to be a small contingent of soldiers that are going to do what they're told.
[01:43:13.244 --> 01:43:15.706]  Uh, there could be some frightening consequences to that.
[01:43:15.987 --> 01:43:25.014]  Now, having said that, there's going to be a large number, particularly, uh, older veterans, particularly, uh, people in the service who are, you know, 20, 25 years old.
[01:43:25.034 --> 01:43:25.815]  Stay there, stay there.

[01:47:36.338 --> 01:47:44.441]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:47:45.501 --> 01:47:47.321]  I'll tell you the good news.
[01:47:48.742 --> 01:47:52.823]  I've been having state reps, one or two, on every day of the last few weeks on the weekday show.
[01:47:54.122 --> 01:47:55.523]  And most of them are military veterans.
[01:47:55.543 --> 01:47:56.484]  They're totally aware.
[01:47:56.524 --> 01:47:57.705]  They know all the PDDs.
[01:47:57.745 --> 01:47:58.946]  They know about the FEMA camps.
[01:47:59.466 --> 01:48:01.848]  But again, all this is now in mainstream news as well.
[01:48:01.948 --> 01:48:05.150]  It's just that those of us warning got laughed at and now we're not being laughed at.
[01:48:05.210 --> 01:48:06.591]  Now understand, this is not the U.S.
[01:48:06.631 --> 01:48:06.972]  government.
[01:48:07.512 --> 01:48:09.714]  Foreign offshore banks have taken full control.
[01:48:09.754 --> 01:48:10.875]  We're in receivership now.
[01:48:11.255 --> 01:48:12.836]  It's in the IMF and World Bank documents.
[01:48:12.896 --> 01:48:14.657]  I wrote about it in my book, The Sentence to Tyranny, in 2002.
[01:48:14.717 --> 01:48:15.158]  We predicted 2008, 2009.
[01:48:19.304 --> 01:48:21.766]  So much of this is such a big planning operation.
[01:48:21.806 --> 01:48:22.447]  It's not hidden.
[01:48:22.487 --> 01:48:24.148]  The intelligence was all around us.
[01:48:24.789 --> 01:48:27.771]  And then by going and covering these events, a lot of it fell into our hands.
[01:48:28.051 --> 01:48:38.961]  And by talking to police chiefs and emergency managers, some who had allowed them in, they told us foreign troops were involved, like Jack D. Compton, an Alice, Texas police chief, was former DEA himself.
[01:48:39.641 --> 01:48:40.522]  It goes on and on.
[01:48:41.323 --> 01:48:42.706]  Now they're going to stage the riots.
[01:48:43.246 --> 01:48:45.170]  They're going to have the locals stand down.
[01:48:45.190 --> 01:48:47.494]  The FEMA is going to jam police communications.
[01:48:47.995 --> 01:48:50.018]  This is one of their plans, to let the riots get bad.
[01:48:50.038 --> 01:48:52.522]  Then the military will come in, fix everything.
[01:48:52.602 --> 01:48:53.744]  That'll set the precedent.
[01:48:54.025 --> 01:48:55.207]  Well, hey, this is a good thing.
[01:48:56.872 --> 01:49:09.663]  So see, there's lots of psyops built into this, and I want to go back to Doug Williams, who's writing for the Daily Newscaster in his story, FEMA DHS Preparing for Mass Graves and Martial Law Near Chicago.
[01:49:10.504 --> 01:49:17.991]  Anything you want to add to the points I was just making, and then finish up with the question I gave you about if this does go, people resisting?
[01:49:18.511 --> 01:49:21.632]  Well, you know, I think a lot of people in the military will resist.
[01:49:21.792 --> 01:49:23.852]  You know, it all depends on how it plays out.
[01:49:23.892 --> 01:49:24.692]  Now, here's my hope.
[01:49:25.092 --> 01:49:41.135]  My hope is that we can cut this off by exposing the information, by forcing these people, FEMA, the DHS, force these people out into the open, make them answer questions, find out what they're doing, why they're doing it, and why they're not doing it in public.
[01:49:41.475 --> 01:49:43.055]  And then maybe we can change things.
[01:49:43.095 --> 01:49:46.936]  Because, you know, a lot of people that want to question your information or my information,
[01:49:47.296 --> 01:49:49.576]  They say, well you're not telling us when it's going to happen.
[01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:55.237]  Well let me tell you from being in that position, no one knows when it's going to happen at this point.
[01:49:55.317 --> 01:49:57.818]  It's not about knowing when, it's about being prepared.
[01:49:57.918 --> 01:50:06.800]  A phone call is made that says launch the operation, there's probably only 10 guys in the National Security Council aware of it, and then they go with the go date, then it happens.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:07.660]  That's correct.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:11.920]  There's a chain of command and everybody below that chain of command, they don't know.
[01:50:12.381 --> 01:50:14.581]  They're given generalities enough to do their mission.
[01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:23.190]  But do you agree, I've seen them do this in third world countries, that they're first going to have a rollout to set the precedent where the troops come out, they fix everything, now the president's set?
[01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:26.654]  Well, that's part of what happened in New Orleans when the 82nd went there.
[01:50:26.694 --> 01:50:29.657]  It really hurt me to see that happen.
[01:50:29.697 --> 01:50:30.758]  I was really disappointed.
[01:50:30.778 --> 01:50:31.739]  The gun confiscation?
[01:50:32.039 --> 01:50:34.101]  Yeah, I was disappointed to see those guys on the street.
[01:50:34.582 --> 01:50:35.844]  And that was their first blood.
[01:50:35.924 --> 01:50:38.067]  That was training them to confiscate the guns.
[01:50:38.567 --> 01:50:51.645]  Now, finally here, I want to encourage you to come back on the weekday show so we can spend more time and let you have a chance to flesh this out because I really respect your knowledgeable opinion on this, Mr. Williams, but I also want to challenge FEMA workers
[01:50:52.245 --> 01:51:09.459]  County, city, people around the country listening right now on AMFM, shortwave internet satellite, to email my producer, Joey V, at InfoWars.com, to cc it to Aaron with two A's at InfoWars.com, and we're good at keeping your anonymity if that's what you want, but this is the time the country needs you.
[01:51:09.519 --> 01:51:10.260]  I just go public.
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:20.428]  You're allowed, as an American, to expose this so more of you can come out, because you're right, Mr. Williams, if we expose this, then they lose the element of surprise
[01:51:20.888 --> 01:51:22.309]  And they won't be able to get away with it?
[01:51:37.944 --> 01:51:42.288]  We're in a life and death info war and you know Mr. Williams, 90% of war is info war.
[01:51:42.648 --> 01:51:46.512]  Absolutely, and you know people should not discount open source intelligence.
[01:51:46.532 --> 01:51:48.954]  90% of all intel is open source.
[01:51:48.974 --> 01:51:51.136]  It's just about digging and getting the information.
[01:51:51.516 --> 01:51:55.200]  It doesn't have to be super secret or something only a few people know.
[01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:59.824]  Usually those secrets, usually there's nothing there or nothing to those at all.
[01:52:00.344 --> 01:52:02.066]  Well yeah, because they'll have 20 battle plans.
[01:52:02.126 --> 01:52:04.448]  What you can't miss is the overall architecture.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.261]  You know, that's what really concerns me is the senior officers that seem to be
[01:52:35.690 --> 01:52:37.151]  They seem to have a different program.
[01:52:37.171 --> 01:52:41.213]  They seem to be involved in something that I don't recognize for my years of service.
[01:52:41.953 --> 01:52:53.617]  Well, I told everybody they were going to build up the anti-terror apparatus in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, that they would then announce white Al-Qaeda, which CNN and Fox have done, and claim that all Americans could be Al-Qaeda.
[01:52:54.378 --> 01:52:55.438]  And it's now happened.
[01:52:55.458 --> 01:52:59.660]  They're swinging the whole apparatus around against the people and training police
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:15.112]  That the American people are the enemy, and the Army admits they're preparing to quote, engage the American people during insurrection, and PDD 51 says, and the John Moore Defense Authorization Act, really the big one, says that the governors are just puppets and serve as dual-headed officers.
[01:53:16.052 --> 01:53:18.174]  of the federal government and that Congress doesn't.
[01:53:18.454 --> 01:53:25.138]  Congress wants to see the full text of PDD 51 for now a year, Mr. Williams, and they won't show it to Congress.
[01:53:25.918 --> 01:53:27.179]  Times are urgent.
[01:53:27.199 --> 01:53:33.003]  20 years ago, 25 years ago, these types of things were just not even something that could be considered.
[01:53:33.043 --> 01:53:37.145]  The idea of NORTHCOM existing would have been abhorrent, you know.
[01:53:37.525 --> 01:53:39.106]  That's not something we talked about.
[01:53:39.166 --> 01:53:40.107]  We used to sit around
[01:53:40.487 --> 01:53:40.707]  Thank you.
[01:53:50.706 --> 01:53:51.307]  Well, that's it.
[01:53:51.367 --> 01:53:56.150]  And now NORTHCOM is operational command over the United States as a war zone.
[01:53:56.811 --> 01:54:03.556]  And the entire infrastructure of face scanning cameras, FEMA bunkers, is all under Colorado Springs, Colorado, and NORTHCOM.
[01:54:03.616 --> 01:54:08.960]  And now it's not just Alex Jones warning you, or General Stubblebine when I've had him on, former head of Special Forces.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.682]  Now they admit the battle program.
[01:54:11.922 --> 01:54:16.326]  They admit the profile because that means they're about to go with it or considering it.
[01:54:16.526 --> 01:54:20.349]  When they finally start the PSYOP to unveil it with PR,
[01:54:22.109 --> 01:54:37.333]  Well, what we need to be concerned about is how, what kind of circumstances do they set, what stage do they set to roll it out.
[01:54:37.353 --> 01:54:42.034]  You know, because they're going to create an emergency, I believe.
[01:54:42.394 --> 01:54:45.295]  I don't know what, but I think they'll use the guise of, we're here to help you.
[01:54:48.456 --> 01:54:57.370]  People are going to see through the PSYOP of we're here to help you, and I believe it's going to turn into a shooting war, and I don't want that, and I believe in the end the globalists are going to lose on this.
[01:54:57.550 --> 01:54:59.753]  That's the absolute last thing we want.
[01:55:01.676 --> 01:55:02.538]  Believe me, that is...
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:08.802]  We do not want to go up against these guys with the training that they have.
[01:55:08.862 --> 01:55:10.423]  That would not be a good scenario.
[01:55:10.863 --> 01:55:13.045]  And I don't want to see that happen.
[01:55:13.345 --> 01:55:14.305]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:55:14.345 --> 01:55:15.766]  This is not Panama City.
[01:55:16.186 --> 01:55:22.070]  And if they try gun confiscation nationwide with the PSYOP, I wouldn't want to be the guys coming to get the guns, though.
[01:55:22.570 --> 01:55:23.151]  No, no.
[01:55:23.751 --> 01:55:25.452]  I just don't want to see any bloodshed.
[01:55:26.293 --> 01:55:28.594]  I really think the information war is where it's at.
[01:55:28.634 --> 01:55:34.258]  I really think exposing people, I think your program, what you do, is just so important.
[01:55:34.278 --> 01:55:35.920]  We've got to get this information out.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.681]  It's open source, or what I call open secret.
[01:55:39.042 --> 01:55:45.146]  It just needs to be made public so these people realize that they don't have the right, they don't have the authority to do what they're doing.
[01:55:45.526 --> 01:55:46.867]  FEMA doesn't have the authority.
[01:55:47.127 --> 01:55:50.710]  They're using, if you go into the history of all this, we're running out of time, but
[01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:53.993]  You know, they've used memorandums of understanding.
[01:55:54.033 --> 01:55:55.755]  They've used color of law.
[01:55:55.815 --> 01:56:04.364]  They've used programs to erode our legal system and turn it into the rule of man instead of the rule of law.
[01:56:04.384 --> 01:56:09.069]  Well, that's what I was going to say is that to claim that Congress has no involvement in emergencies now
[01:56:09.992 --> 01:56:12.953]  I mean, in the founding documents, Congress is above the executive.
[01:56:12.973 --> 01:56:14.373]  Then they made the executive co-equal.
[01:56:14.413 --> 01:56:16.674]  Now they're claiming Congress isn't involved.
[01:56:16.714 --> 01:56:17.374]  Google it, folks.
[01:56:17.434 --> 01:56:20.455]  Congress not even allowed to see martial law plans.
[01:56:20.635 --> 01:56:21.655]  Mainstream news.
[01:56:22.075 --> 01:56:26.396]  I mean, here's a headline out of McClatchy Newspapers dealing with the bailout.
[01:56:26.776 --> 01:56:28.197]  Dirty secret of the bailout.
[01:56:28.377 --> 01:56:29.777]  32 words that none dare utter.
[01:56:30.589 --> 01:56:42.182]  And it says here, decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this act are non-renewable, reviewable, and committed to agency discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.
[01:56:42.263 --> 01:56:46.808]  Folks, we're being robbed by the IMF, by the World Bank,
[01:56:47.862 --> 01:56:51.064]  And all of us are together in this against the globalists.
[01:56:51.104 --> 01:57:00.028]  We must say no, but we also need to let them know, Mr. Williams, that we're not going to FEMA camps, we're not taking forced inoculations, and we're not turning our guns in.
[01:57:00.348 --> 01:57:01.929]  Well, that's absolutely the case.
[01:57:02.309 --> 01:57:07.992]  You know, anybody that would even allow that to happen to themselves or their family, it would be a huge mistake.
[01:57:08.012 --> 01:57:09.413]  You don't want to cooperate with that.
[01:57:09.653 --> 01:57:11.114]  It's not your responsibility.
[01:57:11.734 --> 01:57:13.955]  I support, my best friends, the most
[01:57:14.668 --> 01:57:20.490]  Greatest people I've ever met, still friends with today, were people I've met in the military, some people still serving in the military.
[01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:23.511]  I have nothing but admiration... When you talk to them, are they aware of what's going on?
[01:57:24.051 --> 01:57:24.611]  Yes, they are.
[01:57:25.771 --> 01:57:41.896]  That's the word I get from thousands of sources, is the majority of the military sees them hiring gangbangers, illegal aliens, felons, they know they're creating a criminal cadre, they're getting rid of all the esprit de corps, they're getting rid of all the great history, everything, and that the real troops are very upset.
[01:57:43.054 --> 01:57:43.435]  They are.
[01:57:43.495 --> 01:57:46.376]  There's real concerns in the community, without a doubt.
[01:57:46.997 --> 01:57:54.662]  And, you know, again, I really think we can stop this and we can do it the way you're doing it, the way these state legislators are doing it.
[01:57:54.822 --> 01:57:59.084]  Saying they're not going to go along with Marshall Law, 21 states saying they're saying no to the globalists.
[01:57:59.545 --> 01:58:02.526]  I want to get you back on the show later this week, Mr. Williams, okay?
[01:58:02.907 --> 01:58:03.507]  Sure, I'd be glad to.
[01:58:04.867 --> 01:58:06.048]  We'll be contacting you tomorrow.
[01:58:06.088 --> 01:58:07.448]  I'm sorry I didn't get the other calls.
[01:58:07.728 --> 01:58:08.809]  This was too important.
[01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:11.189]  Folks, I'm risking my life, my family.
[01:58:11.429 --> 01:58:12.630]  This stuff is real.
[01:58:12.850 --> 01:58:17.051]  I told you 12, 14 years before all this came out what was going to happen.
[01:58:17.331 --> 01:58:18.371]  I'm risking my life.
[01:58:18.451 --> 01:58:19.192]  This is real.
[01:58:19.212 --> 01:58:21.552]  They're going to steal everything you've got unless you say no.
[01:58:21.792 --> 01:58:22.693]  God bless you all.
[01:58:22.713 --> 01:58:23.793]  Get out there and take on tyranny.
[01:58:24.193 --> 01:58:28.415]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[01:58:53.826 --> 01:59:03.112]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:59:03.152 --> 01:59:03.893]  This capitalism?
[01:59:03.953 --> 01:59:10.097]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:59:10.237 --> 01:59:10.998]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:59:11.018 --> 01:59:14.140]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.080]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:59:24.286 --> 01:59:26.147]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:59:26.267 --> 01:59:32.970]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:59:33.230 --> 01:59:41.394]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:59:41.634 --> 01:59:47.357]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:59:47.537 --> 01:59:49.300]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:51.524]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:59:51.685 --> 01:59:55.932]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:59:56.093 --> 01:59:58.197]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:59:58.337 --> 01:59:59.840]  Anybody over 40 in the North America...
