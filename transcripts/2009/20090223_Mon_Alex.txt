[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.510]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:32.219]  We just initiated our simulcast of the radio show, now via video at PrisonPlanet.tv for the balance of the transmission.
[00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.062]  The next hour and 51 minutes that we have left today.
[00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:49.650]  A ton of news and your phone calls coming up and some breaking news on the military gun confiscation drills going on in Iowa with a press reporter from Iowa coming up in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today.
[00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.923]  Well, last week we heard about it.
[00:00:53.663 --> 00:00:59.165]  This sign, we've got a copy of it from the man himself, Abort Obama, Not the Unborn.
[00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:10.408]  And that is a clear message of political speech saying, get him out of office, abort a mission, remove him, not children.
[00:01:11.932 --> 00:01:22.277]  And we have the press report, I'm going to play a clip of coming up, and there's others, where during the campaign, the Obama campaign said, arrest people that criticize Obama.
[00:01:22.297 --> 00:01:26.339]  People couldn't believe it until it was on the news and the governor of Missouri and others spoke about it.
[00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:30.581]  Headline, Missouri governor, RNC Obama campaign, has stench of police state.
[00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:33.738]  Well, we're seeing an expansion of that.
[00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:36.740]  The Fairness Doctrine moves to shut down the Internet, as we know, the Internet, too.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.341]  It's all happening.
[00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:43.545]  Here is the Daily Oklahoman story, also another one out of the News of Oklahoma.
[00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:48.088]  Oklahoma City Police Chief Officer pulls man over for anti-Obama sign.
[00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:57.315]  Then they took his sign, cited him, said he was basically, you know, gave him a ticket, but not a fine, saying, you're now part of an investigation.
[00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:02.821]  Then the Secret Service called him on his cell phone and said, we're going to be at your house.
[00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:07.406]  They said, we want to inspect it to make sure you're not part of a quote, hate group.
[00:02:07.787 --> 00:02:13.393]  And so we are joined by Chip Harrison that this happened to here in the United States.
[00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.075]  So Mr. Harrison, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:17.218]  You bet Mr. Jones, glad to be here.
[00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:22.680]  Tell us, all we had previously was the press reports about this.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.721]  We hadn't really heard from you.
[00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:32.425]  Tell us specifically what happened and then give us your take on what it was like having the Secret Service come out there and go after your First Amendment, I guess.
[00:02:33.606 --> 00:02:40.529]  Well, I was on the interstate and then I was passed by an Oklahoma City Police Department car.
[00:02:42.082 --> 00:02:44.624]  The car slowed down, got in beside me.
[00:02:44.644 --> 00:02:49.147]  I had to make another lane change and go to another intersection on the interstate.
[00:02:49.427 --> 00:02:52.630]  And I noticed that they were following me fairly closely.
[00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.671]  They followed me for about three miles.
[00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:57.033]  I'm assuming having a conversation.
[00:02:57.073 --> 00:03:02.397]  There was two police officers about what they were going to do with this sign in the back of my truck.
[00:03:02.437 --> 00:03:03.297]  They pulled me over.
[00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:06.640]  Both of them got out of the vehicle, approached my vehicle.
[00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.831]  I said, you know, we're pulling you over, sir.
[00:03:08.871 --> 00:03:10.872]  And I said, I have absolutely no idea.
[00:03:10.952 --> 00:03:13.634]  I haven't, uh, disobeyed any traffic laws.
[00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:14.494]  I'm clueless.
[00:03:14.514 --> 00:03:16.996]  And they said, it's because of the sign in the back of your vehicle.
[00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:22.299]  Um, I said, uh, my abort Obama, not the unborn sign.
[00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.400]  I said, sir, that's just a, um, an anti-abortion statement.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.383]  You know, it's just, uh, basically I'm trying to draw attention to president Obama's, uh, abortion policies.
[00:03:30.884 --> 00:03:31.404]  And, um,
[00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.781]  One of the police officers says, well, do you know what the word abort means?
[00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:36.842]  And I said, to terminate or to remove.
[00:03:37.062 --> 00:03:39.343]  And at that time he said, no, it means to kill.
[00:03:39.363 --> 00:03:43.466]  So you're basically saying to kill President Obama.
[00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:46.307]  Um, at that time I said, no, sir, I wrote the sign.
[00:03:46.447 --> 00:03:48.909]  I know what I admit wanted it to mean.
[00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.352]  And, uh, he, uh, said, well, we're going to have to confiscate the sign.
[00:03:54.432 --> 00:04:00.535]  So they took the sign from me, told me to go on about my way, gave me a citizen's assistance form.
[00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:00.595]  Um,
[00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:07.983]  So when I got to work, I felt like my First Amendment rights had been totally violated.
[00:04:08.444 --> 00:04:09.724]  So I made a couple of calls.
[00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:12.585]  The police department said, we'll give back ahold of you.
[00:04:12.605 --> 00:04:18.746]  Approximately two hours later, a supervisor brought me my sign back and just said that the Secret Service had been notified.
[00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:25.768]  And as far as the Secret Service was concerned, that this was, I wasn't in any way a threat living in Oklahoma.
[00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:28.689]  And I believe President Obama was in Canada at the time.
[00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:32.773]  Later that day, I get a call from the Secret Service.
[00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:34.174]  They're at my house.
[00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:37.277]  They want to perform a field interview.
[00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:42.661]  I said, well, I'm at work right now and I really can't afford to take off.
[00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:46.785]  They said, you know, well, we need you to be here to perform this interview.
[00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:56.974]  So I stopped on the way back through Oklahoma City because it was clear on the other side of town and stopped by.
[00:04:57.938 --> 00:05:14.293]  Went by my church, talked to my pastor for a few moments, contacted a lawyer, and he seemed to think that we weren't, it wasn't the stereotype that we have of law enforcement coming in and kicking your door down and ransacking your house.
[00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:21.680]  So I was heading back, back across town, and the Secret Service called me again and just
[00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:24.118]  Affirm what the lawyer told me.
[00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.639]  Look, sir, we're not here to disrupt any part of your house.
[00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.880]  We're just going to make sure that you're not a part of a hate group.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.163]  Have any posters up with Obama on it with the bullseye or anything like that?
[00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:34.703]  I don't.
[00:05:34.743 --> 00:05:37.884]  Well, you know, I have a two and a half year old special needs daughter at home.
[00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:38.565]  My wife's there.
[00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:44.047]  I just the easier we make this on my family, the better off, because I understand your your concern here.
[00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:47.829]  I think the police officer was a little overzealous, a little biased.
[00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.031]  And the police officers came in.
[00:05:51.744 --> 00:06:01.973]  Um, made a quick walk through my... I'm sorry, the Secret Service came in, made a quick tour through my house, and then we performed the rest of the interview outside, and that's about the gist of it.
[00:06:03.447 --> 00:06:23.752]  Well, this is meant to be a chilling effect across the country, and the Obama campaign has asked police and prosecutors in Illinois, Missouri, Connecticut, Vermont, and many other states to harass people, and they have harassed and arrested people, and they'll allow an Obama group without a permit to worship him at an event or at some other event, but if you come up and
[00:06:24.312 --> 00:06:25.514]  Speak out against Obama.
[00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:27.737]  They tell you to get off the property or you're arrested.
[00:06:28.057 --> 00:06:29.960]  So this is part of a larger program.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:40.795]  I'm not singling out the Secret Service agents themselves, but this is a crime against the First Amendment, and the Oklahoma police knew good and well what they were doing, and it's shameful.
[00:06:41.616 --> 00:06:47.399]  And I happen to have the FBI training manuals and also have the Federal Marshal SLAT training manuals.
[00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:50.080]  Those are in my films like Road to Tyranny.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:59.885]  And in there I've got law enforcement publications where they say if someone's got a get us out of the UN sticker, this is word for word, on their car, go ahead and take them to jail.
[00:07:00.365 --> 00:07:04.989]  And then it says police chiefs support your officers because this person is probably a terrorist.
[00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:07.491]  They say those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:09.733]  Constitution should be on terror list.
[00:07:10.093 --> 00:07:12.616]  They say they want to put you on a no-fly list.
[00:07:12.676 --> 00:07:13.777]  You then can't own a gun.
[00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:18.721]  They're wanting to make it where 25,000 Americans on average are added each month, now over a million.
[00:07:19.802 --> 00:07:23.405]  And so it's much more sinister because I've been researching it.
[00:07:23.905 --> 00:07:25.547]  But I just made those points.
[00:07:25.707 --> 00:07:27.729]  Would you like to comment on what I was just saying?
[00:07:28.697 --> 00:07:47.489]  Yeah, um, you know, I, um, over the last eight years and I've just known the, um, the hate grow for President Bush and I've seen bumper stickers, t-shirts, signs that were far worse than an abort Obama, not the unborn sign.
[00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:50.231]  And, um, I agree.
[00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:55.854]  When I first got pulled over, I thought, am I in Cuba or Russia or China?
[00:07:56.195 --> 00:07:58.136]  Is this really happening to me right now?
[00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.091]  And it was chilling.
[00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:03.713]  It really made me decide, you know, that I need to go public with this.
[00:08:04.013 --> 00:08:12.638]  And as a Christian and also as a strong First Amendment, Second Amendment rights person, we're going to have to make a stand.
[00:08:12.778 --> 00:08:15.820]  Sooner or later, we're going to have to make a stand.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.761]  Did the Secret Service ask you about your firearms?
[00:08:20.202 --> 00:08:21.203]  Uh, yeah.
[00:08:21.423 --> 00:08:22.824]  Actually, let me think.
[00:08:23.624 --> 00:08:24.184]  No, they didn't.
[00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:25.025]  They did not.
[00:08:25.885 --> 00:08:29.647]  Yeah, well, if they were really after you, they probably knew how stupid this was.
[00:08:29.707 --> 00:08:32.208]  They would have tried to say, oh, you're planning something violent.
[00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:33.609]  Oh, you're going to do something.
[00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.391]  What were the hate group questions like?
[00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:44.555]  They just concerned whether I had any friends that had any ill will towards President Obama.
[00:08:44.995 --> 00:08:48.797]  If I had ever thought about joining any hate groups.
[00:08:50.414 --> 00:08:51.895]  Just basic questions like that.
[00:08:51.955 --> 00:08:53.655]  They didn't go into great detail.
[00:08:53.675 --> 00:09:01.257]  They were all pretty vague questions, but to me the answers were pretty obviously no on all of them.
[00:09:01.317 --> 00:09:08.459]  Well, number one, it's the idea that they say what's hateful, and now you're part of some bad group so you don't have any rights.
[00:09:08.479 --> 00:09:10.700]  I want to play you one of many newscasts.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.601]  When we first reported this, people couldn't believe it, but then it was confirmed.
[00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:18.102]  Here is a minute and a half clip of Missouri News.
[00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:18.522]  Here it is.
[00:09:19.363 --> 00:09:28.806]  Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign.
[00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:31.707]  First, John Mills is live at the county election board in Maplewood.
[00:09:31.727 --> 00:09:36.388]  He's been learning more about which members of law enforcement are getting involved in this.
[00:09:36.428 --> 00:09:37.329]  John, tell us more about this.
[00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:38.709]  Russell, good evening.
[00:09:38.809 --> 00:09:44.891]  Prosecutors and sheriffs from across Missouri are joining something called the Barack Obama Truth Squad.
[00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:48.392]  Two high-profile prosecutors are part of the team.
[00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:51.602]  We met them this afternoon in the Central West End.
[00:09:51.942 --> 00:09:55.163]  They are Jennifer Joyce from the city, Bob McCullough, the St.
[00:09:55.203 --> 00:09:56.824]  Louis County prosecuting attorney.
[00:09:56.844 --> 00:10:05.708]  They will be reminding voters that Barack Obama is a Christian who wants to cut taxes for anyone making less than $250,000 a year.
[00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:13.611]  They also say they plan to respond immediately to any ads and statements that might violate Missouri ethics laws.
[00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.691]  We want to keep this campaign focused on issues.
[00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:23.694]  We don't want people to get distracted, and Missourians don't want to be distracted by these divisive character attacks.
[00:10:23.834 --> 00:10:28.497]  So we're here to respond to any character attacks, to set the record straight.
[00:10:28.597 --> 00:10:38.782]  Whether it is directly attributable to the campaign or to one of the soft money operations, if they're not going to tell the truth, then somebody's got to step up and say, wait a minute, that's not true, this is the truth.
[00:10:40.336 --> 00:10:50.540]  Now the Obama campaign tells News 4 that others, prosecutors and sheriffs, are also part of the team, including some from the Kansas City area and from rural parts of Missouri.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.982]  We're also told the truth squad is expected to include Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer.
[00:10:56.442 --> 00:10:58.343]  Live in Maplewood, John Mills, News 4.
[00:10:58.985 --> 00:11:01.386]  All right, so talk about Soviet Union.
[00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:03.106]  There's the intimidation.
[00:11:03.206 --> 00:11:05.286]  You don't talk bad about him or we'll arrest you.
[00:11:05.326 --> 00:11:07.827]  And no judge, no jury, nothing civil.
[00:11:08.007 --> 00:11:10.108]  We'll decide if it's true or not.
[00:11:10.148 --> 00:11:11.388]  Does that sound like freedom?
[00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:13.648]  No, sir.
[00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:14.829]  Not in the least.
[00:11:15.449 --> 00:11:24.871]  You know, one thing I heard on that report was if President Obama is a self-professed Christian, well then, knowing when life begins,
[00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:28.867]  It's pretty much an issue that he should know.
[00:11:28.927 --> 00:11:31.107]  It's not above his pay grade, you know?
[00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:34.408]  As a Christian, life begins at conception.
[00:11:34.848 --> 00:11:38.689]  And for him to play both sides of this is, to me, just extremely deceitful.
[00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:41.069]  Well, we'll talk more about it in the next segment with you.
[00:11:41.109 --> 00:11:42.330]  We've got a few more minutes with us.
[00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:48.631]  But on record, he wanted to vote for bills that would allow them to kill babies outside the womb.
[00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:52.552]  And folks that don't know this, even the most pro-abortion groups were against it.
[00:11:52.892 --> 00:11:53.592]  Infanticide.
[00:11:54.632 --> 00:12:00.336]  Uh, so he wanted if a baby, you know, was accidentally born at the immortuary for him to be able to go ahead and kill it, which is the policy.
[00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:02.797]  They already do that and the law turns a blind eye to it.
[00:12:03.258 --> 00:12:06.920]  So he is for infanticide, as Charles Key's been talking about.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.341]  We've got a clip of that coming up a little bit later.
[00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.483]  But stay with us, please, sir.
[00:12:12.068 --> 00:12:20.152]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:12:20.312 --> 00:12:24.715]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:29.397]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:12:29.537 --> 00:12:30.958]  It's a documented fact.
[00:12:31.358 --> 00:12:38.443]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:12:38.603 --> 00:12:50.432]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.

[00:13:10.585 --> 00:13:18.630]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:20.732]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:21.607 --> 00:13:22.628]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:23.649]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.931]  This is his M.O.
[00:13:24.951 --> 00:13:26.253]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:26.293 --> 00:13:27.955]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:35.063]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:35.904]  Some U.S.
[00:13:35.944 --> 00:13:41.591]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:45.812]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:46.173 --> 00:13:48.814]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.771]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:19.612]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:28.734]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.

[00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:15.811]  What are you going to do if your family has no food in the event of an emergency?
[00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:19.032]  Do you really want to find out and gamble with your family's lives?

[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:45.411]  Are taxes, food, energy, housing, medical, forcing Americans into poverty?
[00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:51.455]  Is free enterprise flawed or is our monetary system forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:15:51.575 --> 00:15:54.037]  The answers are in Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:15:54.117 --> 00:15:57.559]  Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about the Fed and central banking.
[00:15:57.699 --> 00:15:58.559]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:15:58.579 --> 00:15:59.240]  I will give a U.S.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.281]  silver dollar to everyone who purchases this book.
[00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:03.782]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:16:03.902 --> 00:16:05.723]  It's critical to be made aware of the system.
[00:16:05.823 --> 00:16:06.703]  Get your copy today.
[00:16:06.724 --> 00:16:06.764]  800-686-2237.
[00:16:06.784 --> 00:16:07.104]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:16:14.858 --> 00:16:18.281]  We're talking to fellow thought criminal Chip Harrison.
[00:16:18.301 --> 00:16:27.451]  The Oklahoma Papers and National News reported on his thought crime and confiscation of the evil sign that I'm holding a copy of up.
[00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:29.853]  Abort Obama, not the unborn.
[00:16:30.734 --> 00:16:33.557]  Secret Service, had to go in his house, check things out without a warrant.
[00:16:34.317 --> 00:16:36.400]  Make sure he wasn't part of a hate group.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.382]  Um, you just heard me
[00:16:40.182 --> 00:16:43.364]  Just overall, your take on the state of the nation right now?
[00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:11.836]  I just see President Obama's socialist agenda coming through just like he planned it to.
[00:17:12.777 --> 00:17:20.806]  I think the Congress is, for lack of better words, disgraceful.
[00:17:22.267 --> 00:17:25.451]  I think the Democratic control, along with
[00:17:27.563 --> 00:17:30.905]  Are you aware of his votes for infanticide in the Senate?
[00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:57.487]  The last couple of days, just going over all sorts of information that I received from the National Life-to-Life Council and polls.
[00:17:57.787 --> 00:18:13.737]  And seeing Senator Pelosi, comments that she's made, and Senator Boxer, arguments she made against Governor Santoro a few years ago.
[00:18:14.981 --> 00:18:17.402]  I'm just, I'm not at all.
[00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:18.763]  I don't even know what to say.
[00:18:20.124 --> 00:18:26.827]  Well, you know Obama doubled the funding for the Chinese forced abortions, that's on record, and for abortions and things in Africa.
[00:18:27.368 --> 00:18:29.809]  I mean, that's not a friend to black folks, is it?
[00:18:29.849 --> 00:18:31.370]  Making sure they don't ever get into the world?
[00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.591]  That's exactly correct.
[00:18:33.771 --> 00:18:42.015]  And, you know, he overturned the Mexico City policy, which now means that up to $100 million can go to Mexico to help
[00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:47.385]  Use abortion directly as a population control.
[00:18:48.066 --> 00:18:54.794]  And I read some statistics that said the majority of Hispanic people, by far, 75% of them are pro-life.
[00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:02.354]  And it's just, you know, to use this as a foreign policy, I think is disgraceful also.
[00:19:02.534 --> 00:19:03.875]  Well, the media spends that.
[00:19:03.895 --> 00:19:12.282]  They always say, hey, people don't want to control the borders because they want the Hispanic vote, but upwards of 80% of Hispanics want to control the borders, just like all other Americans.
[00:19:12.602 --> 00:19:14.503]  And they always say, oh, we want the Hispanic vote.
[00:19:14.523 --> 00:19:16.365]  We want to give them health care.
[00:19:19.427 --> 00:19:22.910]  But Hispanics are some of the most pro-life people and pro-family people out there.
[00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.972]  And so they always set it up like, oh, this group wants this.
[00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:28.013]  That's not what they want.
[00:19:28.813 --> 00:19:30.534]  No, no, absolutely not.
[00:19:30.694 --> 00:19:33.216]  It's once again, it's the spin.
[00:19:33.736 --> 00:19:39.460]  And I think, you know, also the media, the general media plays a part in this, too.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.182]  And there's their reluctancy to report the truth.
[00:19:42.402 --> 00:19:50.827]  I think Bernie Goldberg's title of his book, A Slobbering Love Affair Over Barack Obama, just nips it right in the bud right there.
[00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.285]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:58.109]  When we come back, I'm going to play a clip of Keys to Stop Obama or U.S.
[00:19:58.169 --> 00:20:00.231]  Will Cease to Exist from YouTube.
[00:20:00.512 --> 00:20:04.916]  And I like the way he makes the point, but I want to be clear here so we don't get caught in the same trap in four to eight years.
[00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.899]  George Bush tripled the size of government.
[00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:09.441]  George Bush is a globalist.
[00:20:09.461 --> 00:20:11.242]  George Bush supported the assault weapons ban.
[00:20:11.943 --> 00:20:15.104]  And this is what conservatives get for supporting him and compromising.
[00:20:15.564 --> 00:20:24.845]  This is what we're going to get, you know, if true conservatives don't stand up and take this nation back and then educate the dumbed-down mainline liberals.
[00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:37.347]  And so I want to just point out here that, you know, Mr. Keyes and others, Alan Keyes, and others can talk about all of this stuff all day and act like Republicans are going to be our saviors.
[00:20:37.787 --> 00:20:40.368]  Most Republicans are bought and paid for by the same globalist.
[00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:44.914]  Yep, I totally agree with that.
[00:20:45.195 --> 00:20:54.260]  You know, I think living here in Oklahoma, I see a lot of political party division here, but generally speaking, Oklahomans are conservative.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.443]  And I feel that the majority of the United States is conservative.
[00:20:58.723 --> 00:21:04.547]  I think we've got into this political battle instead of looking at what our basic policies are.
[00:21:05.408 --> 00:21:07.789]  And our policies are that of our forefathers.
[00:21:07.829 --> 00:21:10.511]  You know, we have certain rights and we need to stand up for those rights.
[00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:15.684]  When government starts taking those rights first, from us, we need to be vocal about it.
[00:21:16.585 --> 00:21:24.330]  Well, I hope they don't use your case, and many others like it, for a chilling effect where others just give up and shut up and, oh, the Secret Service is going to come get us.
[00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:30.734]  I hope people realize that if more of us stand up and say no, they can't put us all on lists, they can't harass us all.
[00:21:31.254 --> 00:21:36.278]  They are trying to suppress our speech because they know it's so powerful and can't expose their agenda.
[00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:37.819]  Exactly.
[00:21:37.959 --> 00:21:39.560]  Yes, I agree a hundred percent.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.221]  So, if I have to take the brunt of some of this so I get some other people to stand up and be loud, then that's fine with me.
[00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:48.922]  Chip Harrison, as things unfold, we may have you back up on the show.
[00:21:49.202 --> 00:21:49.862]  God bless you.
[00:21:49.882 --> 00:21:50.522]  Godspeed.
[00:21:51.363 --> 00:21:52.603]  Thank you very much, Mr. Jones.
[00:21:52.623 --> 00:21:53.823]  I appreciate the opportunity.
[00:21:54.123 --> 00:21:54.863]  Appreciate you.
[00:21:54.883 --> 00:21:56.104]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:21:57.084 --> 00:21:57.604]  Stay with us.
[00:22:02.265 --> 00:22:03.205]  We're on the march.
[00:22:03.666 --> 00:22:05.166]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:22:06.178 --> 00:22:08.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:13.985 --> 00:22:15.966]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:22:16.567 --> 00:22:19.049]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:22:19.629 --> 00:22:23.813]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:22:24.562 --> 00:22:26.303]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:22:26.663 --> 00:22:29.685]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:22:30.065 --> 00:22:33.047]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[00:22:52.438 --> 00:22:56.382]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:21.306]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:23:21.527 --> 00:23:27.956]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:28.576 --> 00:23:37.088]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:23:37.475 --> 00:23:44.258]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:44.558 --> 00:23:47.619]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[00:23:47.739 --> 00:23:52.942]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:23:53.502 --> 00:23:56.123]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:26:18.497 --> 00:26:26.159]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about the best storable foods company I've found out there.
[00:26:26.639 --> 00:26:35.880]  And I have, you know, bought from several others over the years that had MSG and, you know, stuff that I didn't know to check before I got it.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.881]  This is high quality, recently produced, you know, just in the last few months.
[00:26:39.941 --> 00:26:40.701]  It's always fresh.
[00:26:41.061 --> 00:26:43.262]  Food lasts more than 10 years in climate control.
[00:26:43.562 --> 00:26:44.462]  Guaranteed to last 10 years.
[00:26:46.643 --> 00:26:48.784]  in non-climate control like your garage or attic.
[00:26:49.344 --> 00:26:50.304]  Super high quality.
[00:26:50.384 --> 00:26:52.365]  The website is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:55.126]  The letter E. foodsdirect.com.
[00:26:55.566 --> 00:26:56.106]  Great folks.
[00:26:56.146 --> 00:26:58.787]  They ship very, very quickly within just a few weeks.
[00:26:59.107 --> 00:27:00.528]  They have a three-day responder for $21.95.
[00:27:00.768 --> 00:27:06.450]  That is three days of food for one person to test out some of their foods.
[00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:07.430]  There's just so much.
[00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.191]  Cake, cheese, bread, vegetables.
[00:27:10.691 --> 00:27:11.492]  It's just all there.
[00:27:11.812 --> 00:27:14.413]  Non-GMO grown right here in the United States except for their
[00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:15.873]  Bananas.
[00:27:16.494 --> 00:27:19.757]  But that's non-GMO and also high quality.
[00:27:21.718 --> 00:27:24.500]  Just the climate here doesn't let them grow that, but I'm getting off on a side issue.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.904]  The point is, efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:27:28.964 --> 00:27:29.925]  That's 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[00:27:38.932 --> 00:27:44.178]  Okay, I want to go ahead and play this Alan Keyes clip.
[00:27:44.218 --> 00:27:47.521]  He was ambassador to the United Nations under Reagan.
[00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:53.267]  I think I called him Charles Key earlier, thinking of a state representative trying to pass state sovereignty in Oklahoma.
[00:27:54.543 --> 00:27:56.844]  And I've interviewed him several times over the years.
[00:27:57.624 --> 00:28:01.866]  I, in fact, went and covered one of his debates back in the 96 in Dallas.
[00:28:02.527 --> 00:28:03.387]  Was it 95?
[00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:05.468]  Republican candidate debates.
[00:28:06.408 --> 00:28:14.172]  And I agree with everything he's saying except for the fact that he keeps implying Republicans, you know, are going to save us somehow when they're bought and paid for.
[00:28:14.212 --> 00:28:16.753]  I mean, where was Alan Keyes?
[00:28:16.773 --> 00:28:18.654]  I guess to some extent he was there.
[00:28:19.514 --> 00:28:25.976]  When George W. Bush was expanding the police state, going after the Second Amendment, crippling the size of government.
[00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:27.037]  This is non-partisan.
[00:28:27.697 --> 00:28:30.218]  But other than that, the points he makes about Obama are very accurate.
[00:28:30.678 --> 00:28:33.019]  But saying Obama is a socialist or a communist...
[00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:37.548]  He is bought and paid for by offshore banks.
[00:28:37.989 --> 00:28:41.832]  This is more closely akin to fascism or just piracy.
[00:28:42.653 --> 00:28:49.239]  But when he says Obama is going to bring this country down and ruin it, certainly those controlling Obama and using him to get their agenda through are doing that.
[00:28:49.259 --> 00:28:59.148]  So I wanted to play part of this clip over here and break down what Alan Keyes had to say.
[00:28:59.208 --> 00:28:59.549]  Here it is.
[00:29:00.231 --> 00:29:03.292]  Obama is a radical communist, and I think it's becoming clear.
[00:29:03.332 --> 00:29:06.472]  That's what I told people in Illinois, and now everybody realizes it's true.
[00:29:06.892 --> 00:29:13.173]  He's going to destroy this country, and we're either going to stop him, or the United States of America is going to cease to exist.
[00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:20.875]  Do you still hold regrets against not having long enough time to debate against President Obama?
[00:29:20.975 --> 00:29:21.815]  I don't have any regrets.
[00:29:21.875 --> 00:29:22.855]  I went into Illinois.
[00:29:22.875 --> 00:29:25.475]  People told me at the time I didn't stand much of a chance of winning.
[00:29:25.856 --> 00:29:27.916]  The idea was to bear a true witness.
[00:29:28.576 --> 00:29:29.917]  The man is an abomination.
[00:29:30.678 --> 00:29:33.761]  He is someone who has actually advocated infanticide.
[00:29:34.242 --> 00:29:46.173]  That when babies are the target of abortion, if they happen to escape the abortionist's intention and are born alive, he actually supported the idea that those babies should be set aside to die.
[00:29:46.954 --> 00:29:55.418]  That is a man with such a seared conscience, I can't even understand why anybody in their right mind would consider him worthy of political support.
[00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:59.480]  That's a violation of conscience that is inconceivable.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:06.363]  And even some of the most hardline pro-abortion people in America rejected that abomination.
[00:30:06.403 --> 00:30:07.003]  And he did not.
[00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:13.388]  So what does tonight mean when President Obama is President of the United States?
[00:30:13.448 --> 00:30:14.208]  Is he?
[00:30:14.268 --> 00:30:15.189]  That's another question.
[00:30:15.449 --> 00:30:16.790]  Is he President of the United States?
[00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:22.755]  According to the Constitution, in order to be eligible for President, you have to be a natural born citizen.
[00:30:22.815 --> 00:30:27.018]  He has refused to provide proof that he is in fact a natural born citizen.
[00:30:27.038 --> 00:30:28.359]  Stop right there for a moment.
[00:30:31.221 --> 00:30:39.245]  See, the Republicans can't attack Obama on the real issues of tripling the size of government, which he's openly expanding, because Bush did it.
[00:30:39.645 --> 00:30:46.128]  And they can't attack him on the torture, or the secret arrest, or how he's continuing all that, or expanding the wars, because they were for it!
[00:30:47.489 --> 00:30:52.291]  So they have to bring up this, is he really a proper American citizen?
[00:30:53.091 --> 00:30:54.152]  Who is his dad, really?
[00:30:54.892 --> 00:30:57.973]  Instead of going after issues that the left would actually listen to.
[00:30:58.554 --> 00:30:59.234]  Let's go back to it.
[00:31:00.282 --> 00:31:05.265]  ...that he was born in Nairobi at a time when his mother was too young to transmit U.S.
[00:31:05.285 --> 00:31:06.126]  citizenship.
[00:31:06.306 --> 00:31:08.788]  So I'm not even sure he's President of the United States.
[00:31:08.868 --> 00:31:10.149]  No, that's not a laughing matter.
[00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:18.554]  Neither are many of our military people now who are going to court to ask the question, do we have to obey a man who is not qualified under the Constitution?
[00:31:18.894 --> 00:31:22.317]  We're in the midst of the greatest crisis this nation has ever seen.
[00:31:22.757 --> 00:31:29.702]  And if we don't stop laughing about it and deal with it, we're going to find ourselves in the midst of chaos, confusion, and civil war.
[00:31:30.282 --> 00:31:32.264]  It's time we started acting like grown-ups.
[00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:39.753]  How could the policy that President Obama makes in the next couple of years affect activities like tonight?
[00:31:39.933 --> 00:31:49.183]  Sorry, the person you call President Obama, and I frankly refuse to call him that, at the moment he is somebody who is kind of an alleged usurper.
[00:31:49.784 --> 00:31:50.144]  That is true.
[00:32:14.992 --> 00:32:32.698]  And that's the old amnesty bill that Bush lied about and said wasn't amnesty but kept secret that Senator Session leaked the D20 loopholes where it would make aggravated felons legal and let anybody come here for six years so the families could bring their whole families in and then they go and get on welfare and their whole families paid for.
[00:32:32.738 --> 00:32:35.139]  People say, well how dare you be against the anchor babies?
[00:32:35.299 --> 00:32:36.500]  We're going bankrupt.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.321]  The states are going bankrupt.
[00:32:38.362 --> 00:32:40.683]  The country is falling apart.
[00:32:40.864 --> 00:32:44.707]  There's only so many of us that actually have jobs and pay taxes and produce.
[00:32:45.828 --> 00:32:49.391]  There's six billion people plus that want to come here.
[00:32:49.811 --> 00:32:51.432]  Have you seen how they live in India?
[00:32:51.452 --> 00:32:52.333]  I feel sorry for them.
[00:32:52.553 --> 00:32:53.874]  Have you seen how they live in Mexico?
[00:32:53.914 --> 00:32:54.815]  I feel sorry for them.
[00:32:55.255 --> 00:32:58.078]  Have you seen how they live in China?
[00:32:59.246 --> 00:33:12.691]  You know, this country is, the globalists plan to bring us down into a third world system, destroy the middle class, regardless of what color the middle class is, black, white, hispanic, asian, so that we can be controlled and the elites are going to live in these rural armored compounds.
[00:33:12.731 --> 00:33:13.912]  They say this themselves.
[00:33:16.465 --> 00:33:17.605]  So he's absolutely right.
[00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:23.647]  I mean, you know, there's this new federal board they set up through the 19 million bucks to federalize health care records.
[00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:31.970]  States, I mean, Bloomberg quoted the bill, I covered it last week, and it passed in the package, saying they're going to ration care to the old.
[00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:35.811]  They're going to have boards, bioethicist boards, that decide.
[00:33:35.831 --> 00:33:39.452]  This wasn't Lush Limbaugh attacking, saying they're going to cut off all people.
[00:33:39.712 --> 00:33:41.573]  They always attack Limbaugh and say that he's saying that.
[00:33:43.015 --> 00:33:48.576]  You know, that he's lying and saying that the Democrats want to do this or that to old people, or that the Democrats say he wants to do that.
[00:33:48.816 --> 00:33:49.996]  They're really doing it!
[00:33:51.297 --> 00:33:59.818]  And I've got articles here where they're cutting off the money to the troops, and their bonuses, and their health care, and that they have army charities that are stealing the money.
[00:33:59.918 --> 00:34:00.538]  Of course!
[00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:05.699]  Look what a bunch of big charities did after 9-11 with over $3 billion.
[00:34:06.139 --> 00:34:08.020]  They used it for gun control groups and things.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.100]  United Way and others.
[00:34:10.501 --> 00:34:10.961]  Oh, it's bad.
[00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:12.482]  Let's finish up with the club.
[00:34:13.982 --> 00:34:24.945]  That would essentially destroy the validity of existing mortgages and encourage everybody in the country to stop paying their mortgage because the government is going to pay it instead.
[00:34:25.345 --> 00:34:26.606]  This is insanity.
[00:34:27.026 --> 00:34:31.487]  It's as if we have put insane children and adolescents in charge of our government.
[00:34:31.907 --> 00:34:33.808]  And I think we need to ask simple questions.
[00:34:34.568 --> 00:34:41.173]  A couple of years ago, we were arguing over every penny in the United States budget, and it was quite clear we didn't have enough money to go around.
[00:34:41.614 --> 00:34:47.098]  Well, somebody asked me where we came up with $2 trillion in the course of the last six months.
[00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:49.320]  Did we wish for it out of the air?
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.862]  Have people gone mad in this country?
[00:34:52.402 --> 00:34:54.203]  You don't have that money.
[00:34:54.664 --> 00:34:59.067]  We are claiming that a bankrupt government can save a bankrupt banking system.
[00:34:59.668 --> 00:35:02.310]  Explain to me how that happens, because I think that's impossible.
[00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:11.375]  And the fact that we have just elected an individual who may or may not be qualified, and he presents silly ideas like this and says, let's move forward now.
[00:35:11.756 --> 00:35:19.341]  And we're all acting like the laws of economics have been repealed, and we can actually afford to foot the bill with money nobody's got.
[00:35:20.061 --> 00:35:20.942]  This is insane.
[00:35:21.002 --> 00:35:23.283]  It's got to lead to the collapse of our economy.
[00:35:23.523 --> 00:35:24.184]  And it's going to.
[00:35:25.948 --> 00:35:27.770]  Alright, there you have it.
[00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:33.534]  I want to go to some of your calls, but I want to analyze this propaganda piece from CNN.
[00:35:33.554 --> 00:35:36.577]  I want to critique this and break it down.
[00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:39.917]  This is CNN.
[00:35:40.837 --> 00:35:42.839]  In fact, John, I wasn't thinking.
[00:35:42.879 --> 00:35:44.620]  You have the audio clip at the network level.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.022]  Can you send the CNN YouTube clip to my guys down here?
[00:35:48.422 --> 00:35:52.544]  I'm still in the old system of Minnesota playing the clips instead of my own studio.
[00:35:52.584 --> 00:35:59.769]  That clip about face scanners in the malls, do you have that?
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.881]  Yes, big brother watching you.
[00:36:03.081 --> 00:36:12.787]  Send that to my guys and we'll play that coming up here in a few minutes because they only tell you that companies have put in this minority report style face scanning
[00:36:14.665 --> 00:36:17.886]  Billboards in the malls that have hidden cameras that scan your face.
[00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:23.548]  Folks, again, go back to shows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years ago, my films, because we had the Pentagon documents.
[00:36:23.968 --> 00:36:35.233]  This is Pentagon, DARPA designed, and they're using face scans, digital photos from the driver's license, which is really federalized, as I told you in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, released in 1997.
[00:36:37.312 --> 00:36:39.533]  Hard to believe, 12 years ago, that film.
[00:36:40.654 --> 00:36:44.055]  We show there how they're going to put these face scanners up.
[00:36:44.095 --> 00:36:49.338]  Now they're already up on the street corners and everywhere, and they use your driver's license photo to get the algorithm.
[00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:53.760]  So I want to get into that coming up near the end of this hour.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.281]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to Zee in North Carolina.
[00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:58.802]  Zee, you are on the air.
[00:36:59.742 --> 00:37:01.703]  Alex, thank you for having me on.
[00:37:03.104 --> 00:37:04.865]  I'd like to, I know it sounds cliche,
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.201]  I'd like to thank you for waking me up.
[00:37:10.341 --> 00:37:13.302]  It all started about six months ago for me.
[00:37:13.662 --> 00:37:16.983]  I'm going to tell you two quick stories and I'll let you hear what you have to say about them.
[00:37:18.063 --> 00:37:23.044]  I heard you on Coast to Coast AM shortly after I read Michael Crichton's book, State of Fear.
[00:37:27.568 --> 00:37:29.889]  Getting that bucket of cold water thrown on me.
[00:37:30.129 --> 00:37:37.233]  Yeah, for those that don't know, Creighton's book is where a global group of bankers are staging environmental crises to bring in a world tax.
[00:37:38.373 --> 00:37:40.214]  Yeah, it was something.
[00:37:40.254 --> 00:37:44.316]  And you know, when I picked up that book, I thought for sure Creighton was going to be pro-global warming.
[00:37:44.537 --> 00:37:48.739]  And I remember just being, well anyway, I don't have to say any more about that.
[00:37:48.819 --> 00:37:54.382]  But one thing that happened to me about two months before that is I went through the airport and I had a pocket knife.
[00:37:56.165 --> 00:37:57.146]  I gave it up.
[00:37:57.466 --> 00:38:01.889]  I realized I still had it and I just gave it to the lady working at the office of security.
[00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:04.351]  And I said, yeah, I forgot to leave this at home.
[00:38:04.391 --> 00:38:10.535]  And she gave it to her supervisor and she didn't even tell him that I just, you know, willfully gave it up.
[00:38:10.615 --> 00:38:12.316]  And he was going to put me on a list.
[00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:15.939]  He's like, we need to put you on a list because this blade is more than three inches long.
[00:38:15.959 --> 00:38:16.979]  And I said, now, hold on.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.502]  I bought this at Home Depot, you know, I just carry a pocket knife.
[00:38:21.201 --> 00:38:31.129]  I talked to two supervisors and they eventually let me go, but it reminded me of Rahm Emanuel saying, you know, we're going to use the list to know who's not going to be able to buy guns.
[00:38:31.749 --> 00:38:34.071]  And that's the one story I was going to tell you.
[00:38:34.091 --> 00:38:34.671]  No, no, no.
[00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:36.172]  England's already made it $8 million.
[00:38:36.473 --> 00:38:38.234]  It's $1 million here a few months ago.
[00:38:38.254 --> 00:38:39.995]  $25,000 are added every month.
[00:38:40.556 --> 00:38:45.760]  And they said taking a photo in an airport and ever having a misdemeanor, you're basically going to be on a no-fly list.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.482]  But that's going to be, under Homeland Security, a no-buy list.
[00:38:49.002 --> 00:38:49.202]  Absolutely.
[00:38:49.222 --> 00:38:49.623]  One more thing.
[00:38:49.723 --> 00:38:50.543]  I'm a physician in North Carolina.
[00:38:50.563 --> 00:38:51.484]  We just computerized our hospital.
[00:39:12.827 --> 00:39:17.829]  You know, the nursing staff is asking patients, just like you said, the questions when they check these patients in.
[00:39:17.849 --> 00:39:22.291]  They go through a detailed questionnaire, and the questions have got increasingly bizarre.
[00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:23.611]  Do you have firearms?
[00:39:23.912 --> 00:39:25.212]  Do you have enough money?
[00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:27.353]  Is your husband being mean to you?
[00:39:27.373 --> 00:39:29.954]  And it all goes into a federal... Like you said, yes.
[00:39:30.474 --> 00:39:31.115]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:31.195 --> 00:39:32.615]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[00:39:32.875 --> 00:39:33.656]  Well, now hold on.
[00:39:33.696 --> 00:39:36.357]  Tell folks, since you're a physician in a hospital, what they're doing.
[00:39:37.037 --> 00:39:38.578]  This is a federal snooping arm.
[00:39:38.758 --> 00:39:40.079]  You're basically in a star chamber.
[00:39:40.319 --> 00:39:41.920]  Your wife's sitting there pregnant.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.140]  They've got a computer.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.242]  It's going into the local health department that's federalized.
[00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:51.404]  And then they'll ask the husband to leave now and then say, is everything okay at home?
[00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:54.726]  And again, then you wonder why they kidnap your kids.
[00:39:54.766 --> 00:39:55.607]  But go ahead.
[00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:58.928]  Alex, they ask all the questions without any family there.
[00:39:58.968 --> 00:39:59.889]  You're absolutely right.
[00:39:59.929 --> 00:40:04.311]  They ask all these questions before the family is allowed to come back most of the time.
[00:40:05.055 --> 00:40:31.896]  And yes, they asked, and in fact, it was just after I heard your show when you were talking about this, but I just happened to be in there, because honestly, I'm not usually in the room when they do this, because the nursing staff does it, and I heard these series of questions, and they struck me as very odd, and I was like, oh, Jesus, just what Alex was saying, you know, three days ago, and I said, my goodness, you know, I mean, and again, this just all got computerized, and it's going into a database, and it was very unsettling.
[00:40:32.617 --> 00:40:34.078]  This is a perfect example.
[00:40:34.821 --> 00:40:34.981]  Yeah.
[00:40:35.401 --> 00:40:36.362]  You're a physician.
[00:40:36.402 --> 00:40:37.382]  You're not aware of it.
[00:40:37.462 --> 00:40:49.067]  It's only compartmentalized and it's only one group of nurses that are specially sent to off-site training under the Human Resources, under the Welfare Clause.
[00:40:49.087 --> 00:40:49.827]  They did.
[00:40:49.847 --> 00:40:50.027]  They did.
[00:40:50.047 --> 00:40:52.888]  They went to training for two months.
[00:40:52.908 --> 00:40:53.428]  Yeah.
[00:40:54.028 --> 00:41:00.251]  But see, you watch the nurses, and I've cornered them, and I have discussions with them, and I go, I know about your training.
[00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:07.419]  Yeah, but I usually do this as we're checking out, leaving the hospital, because I know they'll, you know, try to, you know, claim I'm a terrorist or something for even knowing this.
[00:41:07.499 --> 00:41:08.140]  I'm serious, folks.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.221]  I'm not joking about any of this.
[00:41:09.762 --> 00:41:10.923]  And they're on a personal power trip.
[00:41:10.943 --> 00:41:11.684]  You watch the nurses.
[00:41:11.984 --> 00:41:13.867]  Hey, hun, can you take this file downstairs?
[00:41:13.887 --> 00:41:14.708]  And they're looking at you.
[00:41:16.123 --> 00:41:20.446]  It's this secret police, and I'm like, oh sure, and I wink at my wife, because I knew about it.
[00:41:20.766 --> 00:41:30.011]  We had our first child six and a half years ago, and I'll even play along with the petty power trip, because I'm deciding to use a hospital, because it's overall safer.
[00:41:30.031 --> 00:41:38.815]  I know we'll probably be driven into our house soon to have children we don't have anymore, because it's gotten so Orwellian, but we're just under the radar with their operatives.
[00:41:39.015 --> 00:41:39.936]  Let them feel powerful.
[00:41:40.156 --> 00:41:41.997]  We're fully aware of their intel operation.
[00:41:42.737 --> 00:41:45.318]  And, you know, I wink and go downstairs to bring the file.
[00:41:45.378 --> 00:41:46.438]  It's all set up and scripted.
[00:41:46.458 --> 00:41:57.622]  And then before I'm leaving, I walk in, see the same nurse, and I go, I just want you to know I know about all the training and how they got you on a power trip and how you even get side money when you make stuff up about people.
[00:41:57.882 --> 00:42:00.163]  And I said, what you're doing is evil and you're going to go to hell for it.
[00:42:00.763 --> 00:42:02.464]  And she's like, how do you know this information?
[00:42:02.504 --> 00:42:09.389]  But see, this is the level that we have entered and the public has no idea.
[00:42:09.429 --> 00:42:14.192]  It's like when I tell people 12 years ago, because I had government documents, that blood is taken from all babies at birth.
[00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:15.453]  It's not for a blood test.
[00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:16.433]  It's sent to the health department.
[00:42:16.453 --> 00:42:17.274]  They can do the blood test there.
[00:42:17.634 --> 00:42:21.857]  It's put in an international human genome eugenics database.
[00:42:21.917 --> 00:42:24.879]  Now, that was in the Austin American Statesman Sunday.
[00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:26.140]  It's in the car.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:26.880]  I need to bring it in here.
[00:42:27.381 --> 00:42:32.124]  But the point is, is that, folks, I'm not making any of this up.
[00:42:32.144 --> 00:42:33.505]  There's no exaggeration.
[00:42:33.966 --> 00:42:34.326]  Nothing.
[00:42:34.426 --> 00:42:35.587]  I make occasional mistakes.
[00:42:36.047 --> 00:42:38.909]  But generally, I underestimate how bad things are.
[00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.391]  But I'm glad... Let me guess.
[00:42:41.431 --> 00:42:42.832]  You were wondering if I was for real.
[00:42:43.153 --> 00:42:45.875]  And then now you've been having experiences that are exactly what I said?
[00:42:45.895 --> 00:42:50.178]  Alex, if I could say one more thing and then I'll let you go.
[00:42:50.198 --> 00:42:50.458]  Yeah.
[00:42:50.478 --> 00:42:53.861]  You know, they stare at the computer while they take this information down.
[00:42:54.383 --> 00:43:02.245]  You know, when I go up and see patients in their rooms, you know, when I talk about serious things with them, their eyes are always, they can't get away from the TV.
[00:43:02.265 --> 00:43:03.845]  The TV in the room is always on.
[00:43:03.865 --> 00:43:04.245]  Stay there.
[00:43:04.305 --> 00:43:04.885]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:43:05.125 --> 00:43:06.866]  They're in a dream state, scientific fact.
[00:43:07.306 --> 00:43:07.906]  Stay there, doctor.
[00:43:07.926 --> 00:43:09.226]  I want to hear more from you when we get back.
[00:43:12.127 --> 00:43:13.627]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:43:13.827 --> 00:43:15.267]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:43:15.567 --> 00:43:22.949]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:43:23.385 --> 00:43:26.227]  That's why I'd like you to visit acoloblue.com.
[00:43:26.568 --> 00:43:42.481]  Acoloblue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:45.023]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:43:45.043 --> 00:43:46.344]  I use one every day.
[00:43:46.764 --> 00:43:49.126]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services
[00:43:49.206 --> 00:43:49.946]  I think so.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:18.382]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:18.742 --> 00:44:20.723]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:21.383 --> 00:44:22.423]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:22.943 --> 00:44:23.463]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:23.744 --> 00:44:24.644]  This is his ammo.
[00:44:24.684 --> 00:44:26.084]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:26.104 --> 00:44:27.805]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:28.105 --> 00:44:34.847]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:35.247 --> 00:44:35.687]  Some U.S.
[00:44:35.727 --> 00:44:41.369]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:45.591]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:45.891 --> 00:44:48.372]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:12.475 --> 00:45:17.940]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.500]  and the world.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.223]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:45:22.643 --> 00:45:28.868]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:45:29.129 --> 00:45:30.930]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:39.117]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:45:39.377 --> 00:45:43.804]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:45:44.084 --> 00:45:49.633]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:51.916]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:45:52.076 --> 00:45:54.320]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:55.440]  Free of charge.

[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.921]  All right, we're back live.
[00:46:17.981 --> 00:46:21.163]  I want to get into the Chesterfield Mall is watching you.
[00:46:21.183 --> 00:46:24.405]  Now the Riverfront Times, I have a CNN clip.
[00:46:24.425 --> 00:46:27.047]  We're going to analyze it because it is pure propaganda.
[00:46:27.947 --> 00:46:28.847]  Well they try to acclimate you.
[00:46:28.867 --> 00:46:32.669]  I was watching TV last night and everything was acclimating people for trips on the streets.
[00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:34.669]  How much fun it is to be tasered.
[00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:39.211]  They were laughing on CNN about the don't taser me bro clip.
[00:46:39.251 --> 00:46:44.633]  Just all the people are in a subconscious mode being acclimated and accepting all this horrible stuff.
[00:46:44.713 --> 00:46:47.274]  Thousands of studies about video games, violence on TV.
[00:46:47.854 --> 00:46:49.655]  All of this acclimates you and so
[00:46:50.955 --> 00:46:53.718]  A large portion of the public, they do nothing but watch television.
[00:46:53.738 --> 00:46:55.679]  They don't talk to their husbands and wives or children.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.200]  They just stare at the screen.
[00:46:57.621 --> 00:46:58.802]  They're in a mesmerized state.
[00:46:58.822 --> 00:47:11.052]  And you're saying, doctor, that when you're talking to patients about serious stuff, and that's because it is serious, the disassociation engages and they turn to their mommy, the glowing TV, and aren't really listening to you.
[00:47:11.092 --> 00:47:11.772]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:47:12.633 --> 00:47:13.474]  Absolutely.
[00:47:13.734 --> 00:47:18.018]  And it's not just... I mean, you know, I do lengthy interviews at times with patients and it is...
[00:47:19.122 --> 00:47:19.923]  Astounding to me.
[00:47:20.163 --> 00:47:28.229]  And you know, honestly, Alex, it was always there to a degree, and it wasn't until I started listening to you that I truly realized just how significant it was.
[00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:31.592]  I mean, you can't get them to stay on task with you.
[00:47:31.632 --> 00:47:40.900]  In fact, I've trained myself to completely... I mean, I don't watch TV anymore since I started listening to you, but yeah, I've trained myself to completely block it out.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.301]  Well, that's what I'm used to.
[00:47:43.382 --> 00:47:45.884]  Yes, I used to hear it over my shoulder, you know what I mean?
[00:47:46.513 --> 00:47:48.634]  That's why we use films to extricate people from the Matrix.
[00:47:48.654 --> 00:47:53.415]  Television itself and the flicker rate and everything is a very dangerous medium but we use it.
[00:47:53.455 --> 00:47:54.075]  It's like the red pill.
[00:48:07.239 --> 00:48:10.820]  You know, they're in their little mind control tank, and we give them the DVD.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.640]  It's the red pill.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.841]  We go, okay, it's your choice if you want to see this.
[00:48:14.341 --> 00:48:16.062]  And then they get upset at first.
[00:48:16.082 --> 00:48:17.942]  They're like, whoa, I'm in a matrix.
[00:48:18.263 --> 00:48:24.084]  You know, I'm in this control grid, you know, literally being programmed because, I mean, it's a digital interface.
[00:48:24.104 --> 00:48:25.465]  Your eyes are brain stems.
[00:48:25.965 --> 00:48:28.266]  That, you know, grow out during the embryonic development.
[00:48:28.286 --> 00:48:29.547]  You're staring at a television.
[00:48:29.567 --> 00:48:31.148]  You're interfacing with it.
[00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:33.309]  And then you go into a subconscious mode.
[00:48:33.329 --> 00:48:36.871]  And no matter how aware you are consciously, you're being programmed.
[00:48:36.911 --> 00:48:38.151]  And none of us are above it.
[00:48:38.671 --> 00:48:42.173]  And so, you know, I tell people digital media, video is very dangerous.
[00:48:42.714 --> 00:48:43.894]  It's only red pills.
[00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:46.115]  You know, I tell people stop watching television.
[00:48:46.155 --> 00:48:48.977]  Just give red pills to mind slaves.
[00:48:49.437 --> 00:48:51.338]  And literally, we're giving people red pills.
[00:48:51.378 --> 00:48:55.180]  When the Obama deception ships out, that's like giant crates of red pills.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:59.021]  And it's up to you guys to go, okay, do you want the red pill?
[00:48:59.561 --> 00:49:02.322]  Because this is the red pill and this is going to change your life.
[00:49:03.362 --> 00:49:04.742]  And doctor, it's good to hear from you.
[00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:07.283]  Call back again.
[00:49:08.863 --> 00:49:14.405]  Okay, let's go ahead and start this little CNN clip right now, then I'm going to stop it and analyze it as it goes.
[00:49:14.445 --> 00:49:14.785]  Here it is.
[00:49:19.764 --> 00:49:23.767]  It talks, flashes colors, and must shop sales across the screen.
[00:49:24.348 --> 00:49:26.249]  All in an attempt to catch your eye.
[00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:30.072]  When they tend to look, you know, look at the screen, and it's about eight to ten seconds.
[00:49:30.292 --> 00:49:33.054]  But now in Chesterfield, the ads are looking right back at you.
[00:49:33.434 --> 00:49:39.319]  The Chesterfield Mall is one of three in the country testing out a new software from a company called TruMedia.
[00:49:39.819 --> 00:49:42.982]  It works by putting a small camera inside the digital ad.
[00:49:43.362 --> 00:49:45.864]  It has facial recognition, so it takes the
[00:49:46.474 --> 00:49:49.756]  The cameras will be able to tell how many people walk by the ads.
[00:49:49.876 --> 00:49:50.937]  How many people stop to look.
[00:50:04.389 --> 00:50:09.332]  And to some degree, they may be able to determine the age, sex, and ethnicity of the shopper.
[00:50:09.632 --> 00:50:15.296]  True Media has already developed technology to use that information to cater the ads to a specific shopper.
[00:50:15.716 --> 00:50:19.098]  But the ad company, AdSpace, says that's not the goal.
[00:50:19.459 --> 00:50:26.803]  It's just not practical for us to tailor it to a given person looking at the screen because there are a lot of them.
[00:50:37.332 --> 00:50:38.093]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:51:03.673 --> 00:51:08.300]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.184]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:11.384 --> 00:51:14.248]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:14.428 --> 00:51:19.135]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:19.375 --> 00:51:20.296]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:20.496 --> 00:51:23.418]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:23.738 --> 00:51:30.644]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:51:51.162 --> 00:51:52.984]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:52:04.784 --> 00:52:06.666]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:07.166 --> 00:52:10.089]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:19.758 --> 00:52:30.988]  That's right, we're a giant red pill factory unlocking people's minds so they can see the full horror of the Matrix that we're all being deeply inserted into for themselves.
[00:52:32.958 --> 00:52:40.346]  Read all the government documents, the psych warfare, it's very sophisticated, very dangerous, and it ensnares those that designed it as well.
[00:52:40.807 --> 00:52:41.808]  None of us are immune.
[00:52:42.489 --> 00:52:48.235]  Those of you that serve this evil are being destroyed by the blowback of the devastating weapons you're using against society.
[00:52:48.936 --> 00:52:50.878]  You know it, and I know it.
[00:52:50.998 --> 00:52:51.699]  We all know it.
[00:52:53.437 --> 00:53:00.908]  I told people 12 years ago that they were taking blood from all Americans and anyone in the western world at birth for a eugenics grand database.
[00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:01.990]  Had all the government documents.
[00:53:02.651 --> 00:53:07.017]  Austin Americans, statesmen, Texans unknowingly donate children's blood to research.
[00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:14.437]  Medical privacy advocates, ethicists say parents should be asked for consent before newborn screening samples are kept.
[00:53:14.737 --> 00:53:18.062]  What do you think the Austin police chief's doing where he says he's going to take your blood for misdemeanors?
[00:53:18.702 --> 00:53:20.585]  They don't ask for babies, they're not going to ask for you.
[00:53:21.025 --> 00:53:23.028]  This goes into a eugenics database.
[00:53:23.885 --> 00:53:25.607]  Here's one out of United Press International.
[00:53:25.647 --> 00:53:27.569]  Texans using infant blood for research.
[00:53:27.889 --> 00:53:37.780]  You're only hearing about this here in Texas because I've been putting it out every week on the radio here and pointing out the University of Texas at San Antonio is the grand database for all the United States.
[00:53:38.541 --> 00:53:43.827]  It's under UN control, under UNESCO, and the major eugenics operations.
[00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:46.549]  Alright, finishing up with this CNN piece we're analyzing.
[00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:50.231]  Notice they say, yeah, we can identify who you are, but we're not doing that right now.
[00:53:50.251 --> 00:53:56.235]  Uh, but we do know your age and race and things like that and what you're, you know, wearing and we tailor ads to you.
[00:53:56.896 --> 00:53:57.456]  Oh, it sees all.
[00:53:57.476 --> 00:54:00.938]  That's a black guy, looks like about 45, the computer notes, Defense Department.
[00:54:01.159 --> 00:54:02.479]  This is already on the street corners, too.
[00:54:02.519 --> 00:54:04.361]  They're just letting you know through the shopping.
[00:54:05.876 --> 00:54:10.220]  They also have a lot of clothes places you go in now and it scans your body for the best fit for customs clothes.
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.741]  That's given to the feds.
[00:54:12.401 --> 00:54:17.285]  When you go into the airport screeners now, 200 plus airports have got a body scanner that scans your naked body.
[00:54:17.305 --> 00:54:30.096]  That gives them a biometric 360 for look down surveillance blimps and satellites so they can, even through fog or clouds with infrared, get your biometric walk from above with 100% accuracy.
[00:54:30.436 --> 00:54:30.856]  The U.S.
[00:54:30.896 --> 00:54:33.638]  is already under full spectral domination with that.
[00:54:33.678 --> 00:54:34.759]  That's the secret weapon that
[00:54:36.075 --> 00:54:40.417]  That a few months ago, Bob Woodward was writing about they're using in Iraq.
[00:54:40.918 --> 00:54:52.104]  And so they use the driver's license, digital photo that the Fed set up under federalization in 93, to interface it with the face scanners.
[00:54:52.664 --> 00:54:55.766]  So I told you when you saw Minority Report, that's what they're really doing.
[00:54:56.266 --> 00:54:57.207]  And this is all fact.
[00:54:57.587 --> 00:55:01.751]  I keep trying to warn people this is a scientific murder grid.
[00:55:02.291 --> 00:55:04.153]  This is all a Pentagon control grid.
[00:55:04.673 --> 00:55:10.098]  And once they get it in place, they're going to have controlled bioweapons releases and kill the majority of us, according to their own admissions.
[00:55:10.579 --> 00:55:12.841]  And just when you're dying, at least know they did it, okay?
[00:55:13.181 --> 00:55:19.486]  When your whole town's flopping around vomiting their guts out, you know, crapping their guts out, just remember I tried to warn you.
[00:55:20.487 --> 00:55:21.708]  Okay, let's go ahead and finish the clip.
[00:55:21.728 --> 00:55:22.049]  Here it is.
[00:55:23.783 --> 00:55:28.746]  And to some degree, they may be able to determine the age, sex, and ethnicity of the shopper.
[00:55:29.026 --> 00:55:34.710]  True Media has already developed technology to use that information to cater the ads to a specific shopper.
[00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:38.492]  But the ad company, AdSpace, says that's not the goal.
[00:55:38.872 --> 00:55:47.638]  It's just not practical for us to tailor it to a given person looking at the screen because there are a lot of them and
[00:55:48.748 --> 00:55:51.029]  We wouldn't really be able to decide who to tailor it to.
[00:55:51.209 --> 00:55:54.790]  Still, some shoppers say the technology is too 1984.
[00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:58.011]  They don't want Big Brother knowing when and where they shop.
[00:55:58.172 --> 00:56:02.373]  Well, we've actually had people who talk about it being the movie collateral of Tom Cruise.
[00:56:02.393 --> 00:56:05.434]  You know, when he walked in the store and they addressed him by name.
[00:56:05.534 --> 00:56:10.096]  It's nowhere near that because what we are doing is anonymously.
[00:56:10.376 --> 00:56:12.196]  This is only the beginning.
[00:56:12.617 --> 00:56:16.158]  Plan on seeing these ads pop up at malls across the country.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.841]  Alright, total propaganda.
[00:56:19.941 --> 00:56:24.524]  And again, by they want to kill you, that's the eugenicists, the globalists, not these little mindless front companies.
[00:56:25.684 --> 00:56:32.508]  Most of them are compartmentalized, just like that doctor, you know, right there while they're putting everything in the federal database, spying on your family when you're at the hospital.
[00:56:35.936 --> 00:56:37.137]  We have to protest this.
[00:56:37.177 --> 00:56:37.937]  We have to say no.
[00:56:37.957 --> 00:56:40.378]  I remember when HEB was putting thumb scanners in in Houston.
[00:56:40.398 --> 00:56:41.019]  It was on the news.
[00:56:41.499 --> 00:56:42.519]  It's not a thumbprint.
[00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:43.620]  It's a group of numbers.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.300]  Well, yeah.
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:49.283]  They turned the thumbprint into a group of numbers so they can transmit it and control it and check the database.
[00:56:49.603 --> 00:56:53.785]  But it's reconfigured in that digital algorithm of the thumbprint to buy and sell.
[00:56:54.986 --> 00:56:56.326]  So they play a lot of games with this.
[00:56:56.426 --> 00:56:57.007]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:56:57.227 --> 00:56:58.467]  We're not tracking you with this.
[00:56:58.547 --> 00:57:00.008]  We're just face scanning you.
[00:57:00.468 --> 00:57:01.369]  Everything's fine.
[00:57:01.389 --> 00:57:02.129]  We love you.
[00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:04.750]  Please, thumbprint to buy and sell.
[00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:05.471]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:13.348 --> 00:57:14.589]  Hi, this is Steve Schenk.
[00:57:14.869 --> 00:57:16.009]  eFoods does it again.
[00:57:16.249 --> 00:57:21.032]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[00:57:21.352 --> 00:57:29.495]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[00:57:30.016 --> 00:57:37.659]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[00:57:38.059 --> 00:57:39.300]  Whether you're hunting, playing,
[00:57:41.274 --> 00:57:44.615]  The Food and the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[00:57:45.095 --> 00:57:46.555]  Food is an everyday need.
[00:57:47.135 --> 00:57:52.236]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[00:57:52.716 --> 00:57:54.776]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[00:57:56.137 --> 00:57:59.357]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[00:57:59.717 --> 00:58:01.877]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:04.658]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:58:12.208 --> 00:58:18.590]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:20.931]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:21.591 --> 00:58:22.631]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:23.151 --> 00:58:23.651]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:23.952 --> 00:58:24.852]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:24.892 --> 00:58:26.292]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:26.332 --> 00:58:27.953]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:28.313 --> 00:58:35.055]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:35.455 --> 00:58:35.895]  Some U.S.
[00:58:35.935 --> 00:58:41.597]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:42.277 --> 00:58:45.740]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.942]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:11.986 --> 00:59:14.707]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[00:59:14.907 --> 00:59:16.027]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[00:59:16.047 --> 00:59:20.228]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[00:59:20.248 --> 00:59:24.790]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function, or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:35.273]  The SinuPlus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[00:59:35.333 --> 00:59:35.793]  We're good to go.
[01:00:07.975 --> 01:00:23.809]  From the film They Live, ladies and gentlemen, I want to play a little bit of a clip of this for folks when he puts on the sunglasses.
[01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.170]  You can use any analogy you want.
[01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:31.815]  Put the sunglasses on, get a glimpse of the real world, not the propaganda system, or take the red pill and wake up.
[01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:33.056]  That's what this is all about.
[01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:33.417]  Here it is.
[01:01:00.052 --> 01:01:03.833]  And of course there's the analogy of you get a headache wearing the glasses.
[01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.693]  It's painful to learn the truth.
[01:01:05.733 --> 01:01:09.834]  And when he puts the glasses on, it gives him the messages of the New World Order.
[01:01:13.055 --> 01:01:15.215]  I don't really agree with John Carpenter's messages.
[01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:18.276]  He's claiming that the loveless want us to marry and reproduce.
[01:01:18.316 --> 01:01:19.276]  They actually don't want that.
[01:01:20.857 --> 01:01:23.897]  The Mac people were the main commodity of slaves.
[01:01:23.917 --> 01:01:27.038]  Some of the elites did want that.
[01:01:29.008 --> 01:01:35.774]  He looks at a men's apparel sign and it says, uh, Consume.
[01:01:35.874 --> 01:01:40.759]  You can just Google, They Live.
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.783]  He sees the signs, Conform, Consume, Watch TV.
[01:01:47.745 --> 01:01:49.367]  They Live, We Sleep.
[01:01:50.768 --> 01:01:51.529]  But for how long?
[01:01:56.684 --> 01:02:02.209]  Again, this isn't very inducive for radio to be showing this video, just for Friends of the Planet TV.
[01:02:02.249 --> 01:02:03.651]  Burmese actually has an DVD.
[01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:08.956]  Later I'll play a clip of the preacher.
[01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:12.599]  Up on top of us, perched atop us, is the evil!
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.642]  The police come up and start SWAT teaming and we're beating him.
[01:02:16.243 --> 01:02:17.444]  We'll also show a clip
[01:02:19.167 --> 01:02:19.967]  Says obey.
[01:02:20.608 --> 01:02:22.629]  Stay asleep, obey, when he opens up the magazine.
[01:02:22.649 --> 01:02:26.130]  I want to show that clip where they're breaking in on the TV transmission.
[01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:29.612]  And they're like, get that guy over there, I'm sick of him!
[01:02:29.832 --> 01:02:30.772]  Mommy, it hurts!
[01:02:30.892 --> 01:02:31.753]  Making their heads hurt.
[01:02:32.093 --> 01:02:33.133]  And that's what we're doing right now.
[01:02:33.153 --> 01:02:34.734]  I mean, do you realize what you're tuning into?
[01:02:34.754 --> 01:02:36.955]  Do you realize how serious all of this is?
[01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:42.756]  That the elite don't want to kill me because it would bring too much attention on the information we've brought forward here?
[01:02:43.317 --> 01:02:44.698]  People keep asking, why are you still alive?
[01:02:44.718 --> 01:02:45.439]  Why are you still alive?
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.946]  Well, they've attacked me, and physically, and gone after me, and done a lot of other stuff to try to demonize me, discredit me.
[01:02:51.586 --> 01:02:54.490]  But the information's true, so it doesn't matter because it's not about Alex Jones.
[01:02:58.427 --> 01:03:02.251]  Let's go ahead and go to Ted Anderson for a few minutes, and I'm going right to your calls.
[01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:10.718]  I know Collie and Carrie and Nick and Marty and Steve and others have been patiently holding, and we're going to get to you in just a moment.
[01:03:10.738 --> 01:03:13.621]  But I wanted to bring up Ted Anderson here for just a few minutes.
[01:03:13.661 --> 01:03:14.882]  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this.
[01:03:15.222 --> 01:03:16.083]  Gold shot up over $1,000.
[01:03:16.143 --> 01:03:17.364]  It went back down.
[01:03:17.845 --> 01:03:19.446]  Ten bucks went back up again.
[01:03:20.367 --> 01:03:27.490]  The stock market's plunging as we speak, and Ted Anderson's the owner of the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:28.991]  He also owns Minus Resources.
[01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:31.332]  He's been a gold and silver trader for 30 years.
[01:03:31.592 --> 01:03:33.033]  Minus has been around, I think, 14.
[01:03:33.773 --> 01:03:35.214]  And they're just fabulous folks.
[01:03:35.254 --> 01:03:40.076]  These were my first big sponsor when I first got syndicated, and then they took over the little network I was on.
[01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:43.758]  They bought it, or bought some of the equipment and set one up themselves.
[01:03:44.438 --> 01:03:52.908]  And Ted's just a great guy, and I have to know the gold and silver business now after all these years, after almost 14 years dealing with it, and 12 plus years dealing with Ted.
[01:03:52.948 --> 01:03:55.131]  I guess 13 with Ted, even when he was just a sponsor.
[01:03:56.192 --> 01:04:00.137]  But he bought gold and silver when it was, when gold was under $100.
[01:04:02.119 --> 01:04:09.721]  You know, less than it is now per ounce, and silver when it was $5, less than it is an ounce right now, and he still has the very tail end of some of that.
[01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:23.745]  A few of the other things he ran out of, he did get some more of those sovereigns and things, and they only went up a little bit, because he already had a position earlier when it was still lower, but it's not, you know, the deal that we had last week.
[01:04:24.405 --> 01:04:28.966]  So just briefly, Ted, explain exactly what you've got to offer the folks today.
[01:04:29.417 --> 01:04:30.017]  Yeah, okay.
[01:04:30.058 --> 01:04:40.705]  I mean, we do have the francs at $2.23, which is only, well, $2.21 last Friday, so I was able to hold it to just a couple of dollars increase.
[01:04:40.866 --> 01:04:51.834]  And the British Sovereign, we just got high enough so I could offer my next position, which are at $2.79, and they were just a little bit lower than that before.
[01:04:52.894 --> 01:04:56.217]  You know, it's a big battle in the gold and silver business right now.
[01:04:56.975 --> 01:05:01.998]  The futures market, the sellers, the short sellers are trying to push the gold down low.
[01:05:02.038 --> 01:05:05.560]  The buyers, the long buyers are trying to push the gold up.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.202]  The buyers right now are winning over the sellers.
[01:05:08.262 --> 01:05:19.849]  I mean, Alex, I thought I was going to have an opportunity here to buy a fairly good position because we hit about $9.74 today and I was able to get a few things that didn't stay down there long enough.
[01:05:19.869 --> 01:05:21.650]  Now it's up $2.30 from the open.
[01:05:24.361 --> 01:05:26.982]  At $9.9650 and has been as high as $9.9910.
[01:05:27.683 --> 01:05:41.089]  I can tell you right now, I'm hoping that the central banks will come in here and push a little harder on the downside because they're trying to protect their precious fiat currency, but they're losing the battle.
[01:05:41.149 --> 01:05:50.694]  I mean, I look at every one of these opportunities when they're manipulating the marketplace down, I'm like trying to buy as much as I can because I know it's just going to bounce back again.
[01:05:51.127 --> 01:05:52.849]  And I didn't hardly even have a shot at it.
[01:05:52.909 --> 01:05:54.210]  This time it went so fast.
[01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:55.832]  But yeah, you're right.
[01:05:55.912 --> 01:05:59.936]  I mean, the things that I have right now are the British Sovereign, the Franks.
[01:06:00.216 --> 01:06:02.678]  I was able to pick up a few more $20 gold pieces.
[01:06:02.718 --> 01:06:05.921]  I have a really good buy on those right now, but small quantity.
[01:06:06.222 --> 01:06:13.489]  The best thing that I have right now, because it's the same price as it was last Friday, is the Walking Liberty halves at $8.69.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:21.564]  And dimes right now, at $1.59, silver did not take the drop like gold did.
[01:06:21.584 --> 01:06:28.567]  So what you have at last week's insane prices is the silver, the silver half dollars and the dimes, the best deal out there, folks.
[01:06:28.747 --> 01:06:33.470]  Ted bought this at the $9.50 level and it went up to almost $15, and it's still right there.
[01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:35.771]  So you cannot beat the deal on the silver.
[01:06:35.811 --> 01:06:37.412]  How long until that silver runs out, Ted?
[01:06:37.432 --> 01:06:40.834]  Well, you know, supplies are definitely getting short.
[01:06:40.874 --> 01:06:42.955]  I mean, I picked up, I can't remember, 20, 25 bags.
[01:06:44.895 --> 01:06:45.977]  Mona would be able to tell me.
[01:06:56.567 --> 01:07:00.768]  That's almost a 50% increase up from that $9 to $10 range where it was.
[01:07:01.548 --> 01:07:03.569]  I mean, what other investment?
[01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:07.870]  I had a TV crew here asking me, Alex, why do you say invest in gold?
[01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:09.230]  And I said, why?
[01:07:09.911 --> 01:07:13.212]  Five years ago it was at $2.80 an ounce, and now it's at $1,000.
[01:07:13.252 --> 01:07:13.652]  Why?
[01:07:13.772 --> 01:07:15.852]  Well, what else is performing like this?
[01:07:15.872 --> 01:07:21.294]  I mean, I'm not telling folks when to hold it or when to sell it, but we've been proving right all along.
[01:07:21.774 --> 01:07:26.035]  The globalists can manipulate it sometimes for a while, but still, you look at the graph, it's going straight up.
[01:07:26.235 --> 01:07:27.956]  Well, here's one for you, Alex.
[01:07:28.036 --> 01:07:32.538]  I mean, if you put $100,000 into the Dow Jones Industrial Average in September of last year, right now it would be worth $64,043.
[01:07:32.938 --> 01:07:35.320]  If you put $100,000 into gold September last year, your position now would be worth $134,297.16.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.101]  Which one do you think is better?
[01:07:50.788 --> 01:07:56.171]  A $34,000 profit or a $35,000 plus loss?
[01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:56.711]  I don't know.
[01:07:56.931 --> 01:07:59.713]  I think I'll be in the stock market, Ted.
[01:08:00.233 --> 01:08:02.214]  I think I want to lose 35% in a few months.
[01:08:03.215 --> 01:08:04.736]  I think you may be with Al Qaeda, sir.
[01:08:05.256 --> 01:08:08.958]  Well, we're right now at 72-44-13 on the Dow.
[01:08:09.058 --> 01:08:10.479]  It's down 121 points.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:17.624]  And I happen to think that Bob Chapman might be right on this one because it's been right for the last, what, 20 years?
[01:08:19.288 --> 01:08:25.672]  Right now he's looking for that Dow to drop below 7,000 and even break through the $6,000 range.
[01:08:25.853 --> 01:08:26.453]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:26.513 --> 01:08:29.095]  He said in late February or early March it would drop below 7,000.
[01:08:30.436 --> 01:08:33.318]  He said that back during the bailout five months ago.
[01:08:33.358 --> 01:08:34.318]  This guy's incredible.
[01:08:35.039 --> 01:08:36.320]  That's why he's so successful.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:36.400]  800-686-2237.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:36.560]  800-686-2237.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.061]  Ted's going to hold this deal until tonight again.
[01:08:39.121 --> 01:08:41.823]  Ted, what's the position on the gold you've got?
[01:08:49.508 --> 01:08:51.129]  That's just the price-wise?
[01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:53.191]  I mean, I can't remember what the spot was.
[01:08:53.551 --> 01:08:56.033]  But I mean, you're pricing it at, what, $8.80, $8.90 an ounce?
[01:08:56.293 --> 01:08:57.253]  Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:08:57.353 --> 01:09:02.917]  I mean, I keep on buying positions on the dip, and that's about the price range that that stuff was in at that time.
[01:09:02.937 --> 01:09:05.278]  I have people call me up, well, that's not spot.
[01:09:05.859 --> 01:09:07.620]  Nobody can buy coins at spot.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:12.283]  But when it goes down, I can get the coins that are available in the marketplace at that time.
[01:09:12.665 --> 01:09:15.187]  At a better price and it's been bouncing back up again.
[01:09:15.508 --> 01:09:18.470]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you gotta buy it.
[01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:28.639]  Look, Ted has got the best deals out there period because he buys when it's low and sells it to you at the low price when it goes up instead of what everybody else does selling it at the high price when it goes up.
[01:09:28.659 --> 01:09:28.699]  800-686-2237.
[01:09:32.162 --> 01:09:37.566]  And the brokers will be there until midnight Central Standard Time, 800-686-2237.
[01:09:37.866 --> 01:09:41.969]  Take advantage of this, and the silver deal is just too good to be true, but it is true.
[01:09:41.989 --> 01:09:42.029]  800-686-2237.
[01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:44.951]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:46.813]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:09:47.073 --> 01:09:47.293]  You bet.
[01:09:47.313 --> 01:09:49.114]  I'm going to take your calls now as quickly as possible.
[01:09:49.134 --> 01:09:51.716]  I've got a lot of other news and things I need to get to, but let's go to your calls.
[01:09:51.756 --> 01:09:52.457]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:54.879]  Colley in Arkansas.
[01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:55.439]  You're on the air.
[01:09:55.479 --> 01:09:55.779]  Welcome.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:57.380]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.382]  Man, this is exciting right now.
[01:10:00.566 --> 01:10:04.471]  I just gotta say, we're living in exciting times.
[01:10:04.591 --> 01:10:09.177]  I'm really seeing the power slipping away from the power structure.
[01:10:10.034 --> 01:10:10.774]  And back to the people.
[01:10:10.975 --> 01:10:13.276]  Like, I really see no way that they're going to be able to win this.
[01:10:13.616 --> 01:10:15.337]  But you have to understand, they're like judo.
[01:10:15.437 --> 01:10:19.859]  They create the crisis, we lunge at them, they use our energy against us.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:24.962]  So you need to understand here that yes, it's an opportunity for us, it's also an opportunity for them.
[01:10:26.003 --> 01:10:30.645]  It's very serious, but yes, we've got a fighting chance if people go absolutely ape.
[01:10:31.425 --> 01:10:31.585]  Yeah.
[01:10:32.206 --> 01:10:35.167]  Well, I'm just saying, I'm tired of being scared.
[01:10:35.368 --> 01:10:36.168]  You know, I'm tired of
[01:10:36.843 --> 01:10:39.524]  Having people with their head in the sand, you know?
[01:10:39.564 --> 01:10:51.171]  I mean, I think we've got a fighting chance here because, you know, with the implosion, you know, they're creating, like you always say, problem, reaction, solution.
[01:10:51.991 --> 01:10:53.172]  They're creating the problem.
[01:10:53.832 --> 01:10:58.414]  If everyone can find out where the problem's coming from, we can deny the solution.
[01:10:59.155 --> 01:10:59.435]  You know?
[01:10:59.695 --> 01:11:01.416]  That seems to be the key to it.
[01:11:03.871 --> 01:11:04.711]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:11:04.771 --> 01:11:06.412]  I mean, they are the criminals that did this.
[01:11:06.492 --> 01:11:07.112]  It's on record.
[01:11:07.152 --> 01:11:11.213]  Why are they posing as the saviors, saying, give us more power, give us more control?
[01:11:12.054 --> 01:11:12.514]  Exactly.
[01:11:12.914 --> 01:11:18.076]  And something else that encouraged me, I was watching Glenn Beck the other day, and he had a CIA guy and a military guy on.
[01:11:18.656 --> 01:11:20.997]  They were kind of war-gaming what would happen in the U.S.
[01:11:21.337 --> 01:11:26.058]  if civil unrest happened, and they were talking about all that.
[01:11:26.118 --> 01:11:30.640]  But basically, Glenn Beck kind of asked the CIA guy,
[01:11:31.576 --> 01:11:34.717]  How do you keep the bubba effect from happening?
[01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:38.238]  And how do you keep, you know, the control with the government?
[01:11:38.258 --> 01:11:42.099]  And he said, I'm not really, you know, for the government, but how would the government do that?
[01:11:42.139 --> 01:11:46.960]  And CIA guy kind of was just like, well, you just let it happen.
[01:11:48.461 --> 01:11:52.262]  And it was kind of a weird moment when like, I have what?
[01:11:52.582 --> 01:11:52.842]  Really?
[01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:53.102]  What?
[01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.164]  Yeah, you know what, I saw that clip.
[01:11:56.484 --> 01:11:57.805]  What's the name of it on YouTube?
[01:11:58.345 --> 01:12:00.386]  Glenn Beck talks about collapse of the U.S.
[01:12:00.426 --> 01:12:02.087]  We had it up on Infowars.com.
[01:12:02.628 --> 01:12:05.969]  Yeah, oh yeah, because the CIA guys are losing all their pension funds too.
[01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:08.130]  And they're going, yay!
[01:12:08.531 --> 01:12:09.711]  Do we really want to be part of this?
[01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:10.832]  Be right back.
[01:12:12.768 --> 01:12:20.410]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:22.010]  You need the Paclite.
[01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:30.292]  The Paclite is the longest lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9 volt battery, and uses two high powered LED lights.
[01:12:30.673 --> 01:12:33.833]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[01:12:34.233 --> 01:12:38.655]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:40.315]  The Paclite is so durable,
[01:12:40.595 --> 01:12:44.999]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[01:12:45.419 --> 01:12:49.723]  The Paclite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[01:12:50.084 --> 01:12:56.770]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.
[01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:59.672]  That address again is 9voltlite.com.

[01:13:02.494 --> 01:13:03.375]  That's 877-715-4448.
[01:13:03.935 --> 01:13:08.957]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:13:09.217 --> 01:13:16.581]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.822]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:20.403]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:13:20.463 --> 01:13:22.064]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:24.985]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:13:25.025 --> 01:13:28.667]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.086]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:44.267]  An inside job.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.021]  How dare you?
[01:13:49.602 --> 01:13:54.465]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:13:54.485 --> 01:13:56.987]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:13:57.127 --> 01:14:03.511]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:14:03.851 --> 01:14:06.433]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:08.694]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:14:08.954 --> 01:14:11.416]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:14:12.814 --> 01:14:16.655]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:14:16.695 --> 01:14:17.936]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:14:18.096 --> 01:14:21.677]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:14:21.977 --> 01:14:24.478]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:26.619]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:14:26.959 --> 01:14:29.100]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:44.746]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:14:44.806 --> 01:14:47.888]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:14:48.088 --> 01:14:50.289]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-GOLD.
[01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:54.553]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[01:14:57.656 --> 01:14:58.337]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[01:14:58.377 --> 01:15:01.140]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:02.042]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[01:15:12.128 --> 01:15:15.390]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:19.653]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:31.259]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.323]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:15:37.543 --> 01:15:38.184]  We're good to go.
[01:16:00.439 --> 01:16:01.019]  We're good to go.
[01:16:25.697 --> 01:16:45.133]  The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me How's this for the Bubba effect?
[01:16:47.835 --> 01:16:53.460]  I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive And a country boy can survive
[01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:59.720]  Country folks can survive.
[01:17:00.261 --> 01:17:05.545]  I can plow a field all day long.
[01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:12.010]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:15.193]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[01:17:15.293 --> 01:17:19.697]  Ain't too many things these old boys can do.
[01:17:21.561 --> 01:17:24.142]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[01:17:24.802 --> 01:17:26.263]  We're gonna win, all of us together!
[01:17:26.283 --> 01:17:26.403]  Yeah!
[01:17:26.423 --> 01:17:27.504]  That's right, my friends.
[01:17:54.608 --> 01:17:55.549]  We are back live.
[01:17:55.589 --> 01:17:59.871]  Let's go straight to your phone calls.
[01:18:00.031 --> 01:18:03.353]  And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies.
[01:18:04.333 --> 01:18:05.194]  We could skin a buck.
[01:18:05.974 --> 01:18:08.776]  All right, let's uh... Kerry just hung up.
[01:18:08.816 --> 01:18:09.456]  They were next.
[01:18:09.516 --> 01:18:11.677]  Nick in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:18:11.737 --> 01:18:12.157]  Welcome.
[01:18:13.818 --> 01:18:14.199]  Good sir.
[01:18:14.919 --> 01:18:20.802]  I'd just like to talk about recently, Obama came to Canada back on the 19th on Friday, I think it was anyway.
[01:18:21.803 --> 01:18:22.163]  Turn on
[01:18:22.679 --> 01:18:31.001]  The one main news channel here in CBC, one of them anyway, CBC, to an hour-long special all about Obama's visit to Canada.
[01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:36.362]  Had the kids, you know, telling the cameras how they didn't go to school because, you know, Obama and he's cool and all that.
[01:18:38.222 --> 01:18:45.064]  And I just wanted to mention one quote, if I could, from the Toronto Star, you can Google it.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.560]  What, he's our savior or something?
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.421]  Oh, no, not exactly.
[01:18:51.601 --> 01:18:56.542]  The newscaster, Mansbridge, asked him, what is your sense of the country about Canada?
[01:18:56.722 --> 01:19:07.484]  And Obama replied, eventually, quote, I think Canada has shown itself to be a pretty good manager of the financial system and the economy in ways that we haven't always seen here in the United States.
[01:19:08.364 --> 01:19:15.665]  And I think that's important for us to take note of, that it's possible for us to have a vibrant banking sector, for example.
[01:19:16.246 --> 01:19:20.308]  Without taking some of the wild risks that have resulted in so much trouble on Wall Street.
[01:19:21.729 --> 01:19:31.435]  And I think that's just important because you always say Canada is kind of deeper into the New World Order, like we're more asleep, one main channel, that sort of thing.
[01:19:31.455 --> 01:19:33.096]  I'd like to point out that.
[01:19:34.677 --> 01:19:40.981]  Well, I mean, he's also always implying he's going to stop the reckless stuff on Wall Street when he was put in power by these people.
[01:19:41.021 --> 01:19:41.921]  I appreciate your call.
[01:19:41.941 --> 01:19:42.822]  Good to hear from you, Nick.
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.622]  Marty in Minnesota, you're on the air, sir.
[01:19:49.984 --> 01:19:50.364]  Hello?
[01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:51.245]  Yes, Marty.
[01:19:51.805 --> 01:19:53.326]  Hey, yeah, I'm Alex.
[01:19:53.907 --> 01:19:55.508]  I've been wanting to call you for a long time.
[01:19:55.768 --> 01:19:57.009]  I'm 50 years old.
[01:19:57.069 --> 01:20:01.712]  I'm really impressed with you, by the way, for being 35 and knowing what you know.
[01:20:02.433 --> 01:20:13.001]  I've been what you call a conservative Republican for many years, and I've been listening nowadays, and it's getting completely out of hand, where
[01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:39.195]  On the news, you can't get anything from them that isn't skewed towards liberal politics, Democrat politics, and they like make it into a sport where it's the Democrats against the Republicans, and I watch this and it spreads throughout the community to where it's like you see pink elephants if you want to denounce Obama.
[01:20:39.235 --> 01:20:43.617]  What they don't understand is that a lot of us ex-conservatives during Bush
[01:20:44.062 --> 01:20:44.942]  We're against him.
[01:20:45.362 --> 01:20:47.283]  We're also against Obama.
[01:20:49.884 --> 01:20:57.367]  It's like going back to when they were talking about the Vietnam War during Nixon and they were slamming Nixon.
[01:20:57.707 --> 01:21:11.732]  Right now I listen to Alan Keyes and then I listen to Keith Olbermann and his legal person telling him that they're going to have to start prosecuting people for incitement for going against Obama.
[01:21:13.339 --> 01:21:15.801]  They're going to make it completely against the law.
[01:21:15.821 --> 01:21:16.602]  That's right.
[01:21:16.762 --> 01:21:19.545]  You know, they're saying, you can't criticize Obama.
[01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.207]  It's your fault the economy's plunging.
[01:21:21.467 --> 01:21:24.230]  We've all got to do whatever he says and the bankers will fix it.
[01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:26.111]  This is outrageous.
[01:21:26.192 --> 01:21:32.277]  It's like, it's completely, completely, they've been so, people have been so
[01:21:33.452 --> 01:21:36.113]  Marty, why did you destroy the economy?
[01:21:36.693 --> 01:21:38.734]  Why are you holding back Obama?
[01:21:38.754 --> 01:21:42.695]  He can only save you if you do whatever they say.
[01:21:42.755 --> 01:21:44.455]  Turn in your firearms!
[01:21:44.535 --> 01:21:51.957]  Well, when I listen to these news broadcasters, they're like it's a football game and their side's the Democrats and the Republicans are sour grapes.
[01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:53.758]  It's ridiculous.
[01:21:53.938 --> 01:21:56.099]  But the Republicans are on the team too, see?
[01:21:56.659 --> 01:21:57.019]  I know.
[01:21:57.179 --> 01:22:01.180]  I understand that completely, that we need to start a whole new system practically
[01:22:01.587 --> 01:22:09.311]  Based on our old constitution, but they still think we're just sour grape Republicans even though we were against Bush at the end.
[01:22:09.351 --> 01:22:11.552]  Hold on, we went to break and let you keep going over.
[01:22:12.152 --> 01:22:16.874]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.

[01:22:46.823 --> 01:22:54.746]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[01:22:55.366 --> 01:22:57.607]  People spend money on all kinds of things.
[01:22:58.117 --> 01:23:02.179]  But our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:03.999]  So don't delay.
[01:23:04.339 --> 01:23:05.060]  Call today.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:11.662]  908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[01:23:11.682 --> 01:23:18.765]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:19.125 --> 01:23:20.786]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:21.758 --> 01:23:22.779]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:23.319 --> 01:23:23.820]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.040]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.441]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:26.462 --> 01:23:28.183]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:28.463 --> 01:23:35.228]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:35.628 --> 01:23:36.069]  Some U.S.
[01:23:36.109 --> 01:23:41.733]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:42.433 --> 01:23:45.956]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:45.976 --> 01:23:47.937]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:16.730]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.
[01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:19.612]  Can't afford a new vehicle or even an expensive repair?

[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:22.423]  Coming up, I'm going to play a little clip of They Live, another parable to the red pill.
[01:25:23.503 --> 01:25:29.586]  And we've got several Glenn Beck clips where he's talking about martial law, police state, how does the government control the bubba's.
[01:25:30.086 --> 01:25:35.269]  Now remember, Glenn Beck did these series of programs a year ago when Ron Paul looked like he could win the Republican nomination.
[01:25:35.289 --> 01:25:40.071]  He said we need to use the military against these Ron Paul people, they're dangerous, they're bad.
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:42.721]  And on and on and on.
[01:25:42.821 --> 01:25:46.163]  Now, though, they realize the whole public's waking up to him, so he's on Fox.
[01:25:46.763 --> 01:25:51.186]  And it's like Alex Jones has a TV show, but still he says, oh, what do we do about the Bubbas?
[01:25:51.226 --> 01:25:56.590]  And then the CIA guys, including Mr. Baer we've interviewed here, say, oh, you know, maybe we should just let the Bubba effect take place.
[01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:56.770]  Look.
[01:25:58.356 --> 01:26:00.038]  The foreign banks are taking over this country.
[01:26:00.058 --> 01:26:01.359]  There's a lot of people in the system.
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:08.667]  Suddenly we have Zygmunt Brzezinski coming out and saying, I'm afraid the public's going to revolt against the bankers and arrest people as if he's not with them.
[01:26:09.088 --> 01:26:10.649]  And we see that from Beck and the rest of them.
[01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:17.557]  I think there's a lot of different scenarios here, but they're acting like they're scared and they realize that Obama isn't going to work.
[01:26:17.637 --> 01:26:19.118]  It's not the con job's not going to work.
[01:26:19.719 --> 01:26:20.739]  And they've gone too far.
[01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:23.340]  They're destroying the economy by design to bring in the New World Order.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.920]  They've announced the New World Order.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.760]  People aren't buying it.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.080]  The Awakening, I can't describe it.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:28.361]  It's just exponential right now.
[01:26:29.301 --> 01:26:32.521]  I'm talking to folks out here that go to parties and things with, you know, mainline dumbos.
[01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:36.682]  They're all talking about the New World Order and the bankers and the government being evil and FEMA camps.
[01:26:37.022 --> 01:26:37.562]  It's out there!
[01:26:37.662 --> 01:26:38.482]  It's over for you!
[01:26:38.942 --> 01:26:41.783]  Now, it's over for you with the cat being under the bag.
[01:26:41.803 --> 01:26:43.143]  The question is, will the public say no?
[01:26:43.923 --> 01:26:46.564]  Will we wake up the TV zombies that are still asleep?
[01:26:47.424 --> 01:26:49.025]  This is really Glenn Beck, in my opinion.
[01:26:49.565 --> 01:26:57.049]  He's shown himself to be extremely sneaky and globalist, to try to co-opt the movement so he can, at key points, tell folks to stand down or whatever.
[01:26:57.649 --> 01:27:04.313]  I don't want the Bubba effect to go into play, unless they're trying to put us on flatback trucks and take us to FEMA camps, as the military is openly threatening to do.
[01:27:05.013 --> 01:27:06.374]  Aren't I supposed to have another guest on right now?
[01:27:07.834 --> 01:27:08.875]  I totally forgot about that.
[01:27:09.574 --> 01:27:13.056]  The news reporter, you guys are booking so many guests.
[01:27:13.316 --> 01:27:16.878]  I've got my guest sheet here and I just got caught up in this.
[01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:25.682]  Will you guys print me out an email and tell him we're calling him in five minutes, okay?
[01:27:26.203 --> 01:27:26.383]  John?
[01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:32.132]  Yeah, we gotta give the folks the info for them to be able to get him on the show.
[01:27:32.152 --> 01:27:34.914]  Yeah, go ahead and call him.
[01:27:35.514 --> 01:27:45.880]  Let's go ahead right now though, I'm not even going to comment on this in the propaganda, you can hear it for yourself, but this is how real what we talk about is getting, and that's why the establishment is having to put out clones of us.
[01:27:46.522 --> 01:27:49.825]  I've been offered national TV shows, but they wanted me to water down what I would do.
[01:27:50.065 --> 01:27:51.106]  Not by Fox, by others.
[01:27:52.247 --> 01:27:53.048]  That's on record.
[01:27:53.829 --> 01:27:58.433]  And so they really know they can't beat us, they're going to join us, but try to put a spin on it.
[01:27:58.953 --> 01:27:59.994]  And I think Beck's doing that.
[01:28:00.054 --> 01:28:04.498]  Now, if Fox has gotten religion and isn't globalist, but we know they are with Rupert Murdoch, so be it.
[01:28:04.699 --> 01:28:07.121]  But just watch this very carefully as we analyze it.
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.882]  I guess you can give the situation anywhere.
[01:28:11.942 --> 01:28:15.145]  This is the war that possibly is coming to our shores.
[01:28:15.245 --> 01:28:15.926]  The war room.
[01:28:15.966 --> 01:28:18.368]  We are wargaming different scenarios.
[01:28:18.468 --> 01:28:20.810]  We are not predicting that these things will happen.
[01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:23.653]  We're asking, could they happen?
[01:28:23.733 --> 01:28:25.495]  What do we do if they happen?
[01:28:25.875 --> 01:28:27.397]  Here's our second scenario.
[01:28:27.697 --> 01:28:29.219]  Global civil unrest.
[01:28:29.739 --> 01:28:32.201]  Now the United States is no longer the world's policeman.
[01:28:32.261 --> 01:28:34.863]  Mexico has been taken over by narco gangs.
[01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:38.226]  Oil and gas pipelines have been targeted and destroyed.
[01:28:38.586 --> 01:28:40.948]  Tourism non-existent due to safety concerns.
[01:28:41.348 --> 01:28:45.111]  Ukraine is the first European system... country to fail.
[01:28:45.211 --> 01:28:45.952]  Eastern European.
[01:28:46.472 --> 01:28:48.914]  Ireland is the first Western country to fail.
[01:28:48.934 --> 01:28:52.137]  50 million people worldwide are unemployed.
[01:28:52.157 --> 01:28:53.418]  There are riots in the streets.
[01:28:53.518 --> 01:28:58.462]  Joining me now from Berkeley, California is former CIA operative Bob Bear.
[01:28:59.102 --> 01:29:01.003]  One of the scariest dudes I know.
[01:29:01.443 --> 01:29:07.666]  And in Chicago is Department of Homeland Security's red cell unit, Brad Thor, also author of many bestsellers.
[01:29:08.046 --> 01:29:10.227]  Brad, let me start with you, because we're going to start with Mexico.
[01:29:10.647 --> 01:29:14.248]  There's breaking news that just came over the wire just the last couple of minutes.
[01:29:14.668 --> 01:29:15.769]  I believe you have that update.
[01:29:17.233 --> 01:29:27.623]  I do, Otto Juarez, that their chief law enforcement officer there has now resigned after one of his officers and a prison guard were killed over the last couple days with notes threatening his family and everything.
[01:29:27.643 --> 01:29:40.855]  Glenn, this is what we talked about last time I was on with you, is that Mexico is this close to being a failed state, and it's going to be a narco state, and this is going to pose serious, as we discussed before, serious security concerns for the United States.
[01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:53.668]  And it will lead to, I believe, it will play into at least the disenfranchisement and a possible uprising here in the United States with God forbid, please everybody, have a seat and relax just a little bit.
[01:29:55.970 --> 01:30:00.374]  Bob, on the world stage, what are you most concerned about if
[01:30:01.275 --> 01:30:11.268]  If these things would come true, what happens to us is we have to retract back into ourselves because we can't afford to be the world's policeman.
[01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:13.251]  What concerns you?
[01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:14.473]  What does the world look like?
[01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:21.893]  Here's a couple scenarios that are becoming very real, not just risks, but probability.
[01:30:22.314 --> 01:30:25.335]  Let's say we go into a prolonged depression.
[01:30:25.856 --> 01:30:28.897]  Price of oil falls to $5 or $6 a barrel.
[01:30:28.997 --> 01:30:31.399]  The Gulf states start going under one by one.
[01:30:31.479 --> 01:30:34.961]  Saudi Arabia depends on very expensive oil.
[01:30:35.581 --> 01:30:36.382]  So does Iran.
[01:30:36.422 --> 01:30:38.643]  Iran's got a population of 70 million.
[01:30:39.364 --> 01:30:40.404]  People start to starve.
[01:30:40.424 --> 01:30:41.145]  They're out of money.
[01:30:41.165 --> 01:30:42.186]  A big army.
[01:30:43.166 --> 01:30:44.687]  They move into the Gulf and take it.
[01:30:44.888 --> 01:30:48.150]  We have a hostile regime in control of our resources.
[01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:50.652]  That is not that far away.
[01:30:51.192 --> 01:30:56.956]  You know, we have, I know both of you gentlemen, we have talked over the years about Iran getting a nuke.
[01:30:57.596 --> 01:31:01.639]  And Benjamin Netanyahu is now the guy in charge.
[01:31:02.259 --> 01:31:06.582]  And he looked me in the eye and said, we have a right to survive.
[01:31:06.702 --> 01:31:08.443]  We have a right to live.
[01:31:09.324 --> 01:31:13.807]  And he was very clear with me that he would not allow Iran to get a nuke.
[01:31:13.867 --> 01:31:15.608]  They now have the material to make one.
[01:31:15.928 --> 01:31:18.610]  How much of a role does that play in what's coming?
[01:31:19.631 --> 01:31:21.232]  Glenn, I think it's huge.
[01:31:21.412 --> 01:31:22.112]  Go ahead.
[01:31:22.612 --> 01:31:23.393]  Go ahead, Brad.
[01:31:23.433 --> 01:31:24.173]  I think it's going to be a...
[01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:35.444]  I think it's going to be a big deal, especially if this crisis, and I have confidence in America, I don't think we're going to get wiped off the map as far as just having to remove ourselves from the world stage.
[01:31:35.765 --> 01:31:47.991]  But if that does happen, if we're wargaming that here, Israel, if your older brother is all of a sudden not at the playground with you one morning, your younger brother needs to step up and knock the biggest kid right in the teeth if he doesn't want to have problems.
[01:31:48.231 --> 01:31:50.753]  And I wouldn't begrudge Israel the right to do that for a second.
[01:31:51.153 --> 01:31:51.353]  Bob?
[01:31:52.847 --> 01:31:55.488]  Glenn, there's a pool at the Pentagon right now.
[01:31:55.508 --> 01:31:57.728]  I talked to a couple of officers the last couple of days.
[01:31:57.808 --> 01:32:01.009]  What are the chances of a major war in the Middle East?
[01:32:01.049 --> 01:32:04.810]  And they're putting it 55% with NetYahoo's appointment today.
[01:32:04.991 --> 01:32:07.411]  What does that do to us, Bob?
[01:32:09.172 --> 01:32:12.833]  Archduke Ferdinand was a guy that most people in America never even heard of.
[01:32:13.333 --> 01:32:17.834]  He was gunned down in the streets and all of a sudden we were in World War I and the whole world was at war.
[01:32:18.895 --> 01:32:19.695]  And we were there with him.
[01:32:20.879 --> 01:32:22.460]  I'll tell you the way it goes, Glenn.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.780]  Netanyahu goes into Gaza, Gaza City.
[01:32:27.101 --> 01:32:31.322]  At the same time, there's rockets coming across the border from Lebanon.
[01:32:31.962 --> 01:32:36.844]  The Israelis are obligated to go into Damascus, hit Hamas headquarters there, hit Hezbollah.
[01:32:37.244 --> 01:32:38.504]  That will pull in Iran.
[01:32:38.544 --> 01:32:40.505]  There will be retaliation against Iran.
[01:32:41.145 --> 01:32:47.607]  Iran has a couple thousand rockets facing, again, this is my bias, but facing the oil facilities on the other side of the Gulf.
[01:32:48.127 --> 01:32:52.089]  And they have promised, and I truly believe they will, they'll fire the rockets at these oil facilities.
[01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:54.089]  And this will all occur within minutes.
[01:32:54.289 --> 01:33:01.372]  I mean, this is a risk, it's not a certainty, but this is the kind of considerations that are going on at the Pentagon today.
[01:33:03.325 --> 01:33:08.388]  Did anybody, and this is one of the things that really woke me up, and it was after 9-11.
[01:33:08.788 --> 01:33:15.733]  I remember the first time I read it, it was Osama Bin Laden, and he said, what I did to Russia, I will bring to the United States.
[01:33:15.773 --> 01:33:21.937]  And I thought, you arrogant SOB, you didn't bring down Russia, it was Reagan and the Pope and Thatcher.
[01:33:22.777 --> 01:33:25.443]  And indeed, he played a huge role.
[01:33:25.884 --> 01:33:26.585]  We all did.
[01:33:26.605 --> 01:33:28.088]  It was the perfect storm.
[01:33:28.208 --> 01:33:33.419]  And about five years ago, that's... When I re-read it again, I went, oh my gosh.
[01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:48.647]  That's what I'm most concerned about, is that there are so many of these things that could be huge, but also that's tied in to what would happen in the Middle East is also tied in to just running over Europe.
[01:33:49.027 --> 01:33:53.969]  Europe itself is teetering with Muslim extremists as well.
[01:33:54.690 --> 01:34:00.752]  How does the world stand without America standing there and being prepared to deal with it?
[01:34:02.264 --> 01:34:05.407]  Glenn, you know, this is a very important point that you brought up.
[01:34:05.467 --> 01:34:09.011]  What happens with America not there is exactly what happens when the teacher leaves the classroom.
[01:34:09.472 --> 01:34:12.896]  A lot of these people go wild, and I'm talking in particular in the Muslim world.
[01:34:13.196 --> 01:34:23.407]  And what you have in Western Europe in particular is they are no longer going to be able to be embarrassed how we interact with them or how we think about them and how they deal with this threat over there.
[01:34:23.647 --> 01:34:25.329]  They're going to fold like a cheap wallet.
[01:34:25.369 --> 01:34:26.390]  They already are falling.
[01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:29.513]  We saw here with Welders where they wouldn't let him in to speak.
[01:34:29.753 --> 01:34:31.635]  And he got invited to the House of Parliament there.
[01:34:31.955 --> 01:34:33.137]  So this is a big problem.
[01:34:33.157 --> 01:34:36.280]  And Bin Laden also said that his goal was to cripple us economically.
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.381]  So what a great time.
[01:34:37.461 --> 01:34:38.202]  Okay, enough of that.
[01:34:38.222 --> 01:34:39.163]  I don't have time.
[01:34:39.423 --> 01:34:40.124]  There's even more.
[01:34:40.945 --> 01:34:42.766]  Look, it's all just a bunch of twisting.
[01:34:43.507 --> 01:34:47.329]  The United States has funded the drug war to go after cartels that aren't paying their cut.
[01:34:47.369 --> 01:34:48.869]  That's why Mexico is collapsing.
[01:34:48.909 --> 01:34:59.514]  The bankers, we told you this before, we told you when gas was, you know, oil was $147 a barrel, it was going to go down below $50 and it did, to cripple and cause insurrection rebellion worldwide.
[01:35:00.294 --> 01:35:01.575]  And this is World War III.
[01:35:01.615 --> 01:35:05.259]  This is the New World Order bringing in financial collapse against the U.S., against everybody.
[01:35:05.659 --> 01:35:10.804]  And they're busy telling you about the Muslim extremists they engineered back in the 80s are going to get us if the U.S.
[01:35:10.824 --> 01:35:12.425]  doesn't continue to be the policeman of the world.
[01:35:12.445 --> 01:35:15.648]  So the bottom line is invade the world or we're all dead.
[01:35:16.349 --> 01:35:20.312]  What the Rand Corporation said three months ago about how they need to start a giant world war.
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:25.482]  And this is it, folks, and it's just pathetic.
[01:35:26.102 --> 01:35:34.145]  I want to, and I apologize we got him on late here, and we got behind here, Bill Petroski, who writes for the Des Moines Register.
[01:35:35.561 --> 01:35:43.570]  And he's been reporting on some of the things going on there in Iowa, dealing with the military drills.
[01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:44.672]  He wanted to talk to me.
[01:35:44.692 --> 01:35:48.075]  If you need to talk to me off air, sir, since we got you on late, that's fine too.
[01:35:48.135 --> 01:35:52.520]  And also some of the things going on with the pension funds and things there in Iowa.
[01:35:52.761 --> 01:35:53.542]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:35:54.616 --> 01:35:54.816]  Yeah, hi.
[01:35:54.836 --> 01:35:55.597]  How are you?
[01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:56.717]  Good.
[01:35:57.278 --> 01:35:58.899]  Specifically, you wanted to talk to me?
[01:35:58.939 --> 01:36:02.201]  Yeah, I just wanted to ask you.
[01:36:03.202 --> 01:36:20.032]  I talk with people from the Iowa National Guard and folks from the city of Arcadia, and they told me that they'd received many, many calls of protest, and apparently a lot of the calls emanated from your readers.
[01:36:21.233 --> 01:36:21.994]  So I was interested.
[01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:31.839]  Since they specifically mentioned your name, I was interested in just kind of what your take was on the situation with Arcadia and what your concerns were about it.
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:33.520]  Well, I appreciate you calling.
[01:36:33.861 --> 01:36:42.826]  Look, I've made three films back in the late 90s and early 2000s about urban warfare drills and have video of Marines and Army.
[01:36:43.226 --> 01:36:44.727]  You can just Google them.
[01:36:45.268 --> 01:36:49.250]  Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:51.091]  And you don't have to believe Alex Jones as a reporter.
[01:36:51.131 --> 01:36:51.952]  Just watch the troops.
[01:36:52.612 --> 01:37:01.675]  Openly training with role players, screaming, I'm an American, please don't put me in a camp, and interrogating people and saying, where'd you get the firearms, where are you from, I'm from San Francisco.
[01:37:02.115 --> 01:37:10.478]  This is clearly for the United States, and you know, the Pentagon has announced that they're going to put 20,000 combat troops on the streets of America for civil insurrection.
[01:37:11.578 --> 01:37:15.923]  The Army War College has come out and said they're preparing to deal with the American people for insurrection.
[01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:17.024]  They said that two months ago.
[01:37:17.044 --> 01:37:19.447]  You can LexisNexis it or Google it.
[01:37:19.707 --> 01:37:26.774]  And, you know, they said they were going to do these door-to-door things, knock and ask if it's okay if they can look, practice setting up roadblocks, blocking off the town.
[01:37:27.535 --> 01:37:28.696]  And we got in press reports
[01:37:29.597 --> 01:37:39.761]  What I've seen in other drills, from the NCO, Sergeant Mike Knotts, who would actually be running this, he said what we've always witnessed and what we know is true.
[01:37:40.162 --> 01:37:54.548]  Then I get Lieutenant Colonel Greg Hapgood on last Friday, you can listen to that interview, just Google it, it's all over the web, and Alex Jones, Lieutenant Colonel Greg Hapgood, and it was a different story, and then I predicted to my staff, I said,
[01:37:55.268 --> 01:37:59.210]  Watch, they're going to claim it's cancelled, then they're going to claim it's scaled back, but they'll go ahead and do it.
[01:37:59.410 --> 01:38:11.176]  Because I've seen, I've been to too many of these, and we've got video of Marines walking up with guns in Hebron, Maryland saying, turn your cameras off, while they have the neighborhood kids running around looking for the gun owners in a drill, you know, in 1998.
[01:38:13.257 --> 01:38:18.562]  And so this has been, you know, this is, when you hear black helicopter, this is citizens who've been under this.
[01:38:18.582 --> 01:38:29.933]  You know, we have links in our stories that we've written at PrisonPlanet.com to mainstream news where people shot live video thinking in Virginia and places in Florida they were being invaded.
[01:38:31.214 --> 01:38:46.264]  And so this is part of acclimation for martial law and it's now on record under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and Presidential Decision Directive 51 and the new Pentagon Directives to use regular army troops under NORTHCOM against the American people.
[01:38:47.965 --> 01:38:59.934]  And is it your feeling then that what is going to happen is that this economic recession is going to get so bad that there's going to be, we're going to lose control, that people are going to be
[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:07.129]  Rioting and that type of thing, and that the military will say that military force is needed against the people.
[01:39:07.911 --> 01:39:08.732]  Yes, they've said that.
[01:39:08.892 --> 01:39:15.822]  They have said that they are preparing in the news, defense department memorandums that's been in the Washington Post.
[01:39:16.182 --> 01:39:16.783]  When you read it,
[01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:19.106]  Basic, total federalization.
[01:39:19.147 --> 01:39:20.428]  The governors will be dual-headed.
[01:39:20.749 --> 01:39:22.771]  Federal officers serving at the pleasure of the president.
[01:39:23.072 --> 01:39:24.734]  The Congress is ceremonial.
[01:39:25.194 --> 01:39:31.503]  Under PDD 51, they're not even allowed to see the full directive, but the cover sheet says, for any emergency, you know, Congress is out of the mix.
[01:39:32.084 --> 01:39:34.206]  When Congress is co-equal to the presidency,
[01:39:35.287 --> 01:39:39.049]  The Homeland Security Committee is not allowed to see that, so that's on record if you'd like to pull that up.
[01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:51.957]  And indeed, this crisis, you know how the IMF and World Bank have been caught over and over again bringing down third world countries, staging riots, staging depressions to fully implode the economy so they can buy it up?
[01:39:52.937 --> 01:39:55.480]  Well, that's what's being done to the United States right now.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:08.672]  And the big oil companies, in concert with the central banks, have lowered, and we predicted this, by the way, before it happened with Lindsey Williams, when it was $147 a barrel, as you heard me say earlier, that they would drop it down to below $50.
[01:40:08.772 --> 01:40:10.013]  It's now, what, $35?
[01:40:10.313 --> 01:40:14.097]  To bankrupt the world, to bring in this worldwide crisis, is the Rand Corporation.
[01:40:14.577 --> 01:40:15.858]  It would be an Anglo-American world government?
[01:40:32.423 --> 01:40:33.264]  Yes, run.
[01:40:33.284 --> 01:40:34.784]  Well, this is them saying this, sir.
[01:40:34.845 --> 01:40:36.145]  This is Time Magazine and Newsweek.
[01:40:36.345 --> 01:40:37.246]  Okay.
[01:40:37.306 --> 01:40:38.587]  And the Financial Times of London.
[01:40:38.867 --> 01:40:40.908]  You'll want to check the Financial Times of London article.
[01:40:41.208 --> 01:40:42.709]  And now for world government.
[01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:46.031]  And it's published by a Bilderberg Group member.
[01:40:46.512 --> 01:40:49.874]  And it says, yes, we kept world government secret from you for your own interest.
[01:40:50.394 --> 01:40:51.195]  Yes, it's real.
[01:40:52.215 --> 01:40:54.757]  And it's going to be authoritarian for your own good.
[01:40:56.371 --> 01:41:00.553]  And so everything I'm telling you is on record what they're planning to do right now.
[01:41:00.953 --> 01:41:07.075]  And they've got Brzezinski and others on MSNBC hyping that all these riots and horrible things are going to happen.
[01:41:07.255 --> 01:41:08.756]  I hope that they don't.
[01:41:09.216 --> 01:41:10.737]  I hope that this can be averted.
[01:41:10.797 --> 01:41:16.759]  But they're using this as a pretext to set the precedent to occupy the United States with federal forces.
[01:41:16.779 --> 01:41:19.500]  Sure.
[01:41:19.981 --> 01:41:22.882]  No, I understand what you're saying.
[01:41:24.150 --> 01:41:25.731]  Okay, well that's helpful.
[01:41:25.751 --> 01:41:28.213]  I just wanted to understand that.
[01:41:28.293 --> 01:41:30.794]  I know that they had really been deluged with that.
[01:41:30.834 --> 01:41:39.660]  In fact, I talked with the city clerk there in Arcadia and she told me that she had 14 messages on her voicemail when she came to work this morning.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:45.064]  And you're probably aware, the people in Arcadia have said that they are not opposed to this.
[01:41:46.765 --> 01:41:49.126]  Well, I'm sure they... Oh, every person in Arcadia?
[01:41:49.166 --> 01:41:49.327]  All 445? 443.
[01:41:53.348 --> 01:41:54.909]  Okay, so you've talked to all 443?
[01:41:55.449 --> 01:42:01.133]  No, I talked with the mayor and the city clerk.
[01:42:01.994 --> 01:42:05.036]  Well, you know, most of these cities get money to do this.
[01:42:05.056 --> 01:42:11.860]  In fact, just Google Alex Jones Interviews San Antonio Police Chief, they brought in bags of cash and tried to buy them off.
[01:42:12.281 --> 01:42:13.661]  And he said, this is bribery, get out of there.
[01:42:13.681 --> 01:42:14.182]  It's video.
[01:42:16.011 --> 01:42:18.994]  Uh, so, um, I mean, that's going on.
[01:42:19.014 --> 01:42:26.422]  Uh, the people, uh, there, we've gotten calls from the town, on and off air, of people who are very upset, people in nearby areas who do not like it.
[01:42:26.542 --> 01:42:31.147]  You have gotten calls from the town, from people who are... Yes, sir, and let me be clear, I meant to give... And from nearby.
[01:42:31.467 --> 01:42:34.290]  Yes, I meant to give the number out on air last Friday.
[01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:36.012]  We didn't even give the number out to these people.
[01:42:36.273 --> 01:42:36.593]  Okay.
[01:42:36.993 --> 01:42:37.113]  Yeah.
[01:42:37.794 --> 01:42:43.317]  In fact, I think I'm going to do that tomorrow because they're upset about all these calls.
[01:42:43.337 --> 01:42:47.298]  I'm going to let them have about 3,000 or 4,000 calls if they don't like a few dozen.
[01:42:47.999 --> 01:42:48.299]  Okay.
[01:42:48.759 --> 01:42:49.740]  Well, thank you very much, sir.
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:50.560]  I appreciate your time.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.080]  You bet.
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.101]  Hey, how's your 401k doing, bro?
[01:42:54.402 --> 01:42:57.963]  To be honest with you, I'm in great shape.
[01:42:57.983 --> 01:43:01.165]  I actually made money last year because I was not in the stock market.
[01:43:01.741 --> 01:43:02.802]  Me neither, I was in gold.
[01:43:02.822 --> 01:43:06.285]  You know what, I've got a question for you because I saw something about pension funds.
[01:43:06.946 --> 01:43:11.389]  The largest state of pension funds.
[01:43:11.409 --> 01:43:12.070]  Stay there, stay there.

[01:46:25.049 --> 01:46:27.430]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:33.933]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[01:46:33.953 --> 01:46:37.375]  Oh, goddamn hacker, that second time tonight that asshole's got in.
[01:46:39.176 --> 01:46:47.940]  The movement was begun eight months ago by a small group of scientists who discovered, quite by accident, these signals being sent through time.
[01:46:50.094 --> 01:46:50.835]  Alright, that's it.
[01:46:50.855 --> 01:46:52.896]  That's not the clip I wanted to play exactly.
[01:46:52.956 --> 01:46:53.536]  Thanks guys.
[01:46:53.556 --> 01:46:55.778]  Apologize for that, GD there.
[01:46:55.818 --> 01:46:56.498]  That's terrible.
[01:46:56.518 --> 01:46:57.599]  We wanted to put another clip from that movie.
[01:46:57.639 --> 01:46:58.379]  Apologize for that.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:46:59.960]  Honest mistake.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:00.661]  You know what?
[01:47:00.701 --> 01:47:05.003]  Going back in closing with the Des Moines Register, Bill Petroski.
[01:47:05.924 --> 01:47:11.107]  Sir, tell us separately about what's happening with some of the pension funds there in Iowa right now.
[01:47:11.467 --> 01:47:14.189]  I just posted a story this morning that our
[01:47:14.778 --> 01:47:27.669]  The largest public employee pension fund in Iowa announced today that $339 million of its assets are frozen because of a federal investigation of a California-based investment management firm.
[01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:36.896]  It only represents about 2% of their assets, but certainly $339 million, that's nothing to sneeze at.
[01:47:37.817 --> 01:47:40.539]  The National Futures Association is
[01:47:41.832 --> 01:47:42.373]  It's good to see you.
[01:48:03.866 --> 01:48:08.508]  As of last June, as of December 31, it was like $18.3 billion.
[01:48:08.548 --> 01:48:11.789]  So there's a lot of concern about something like that.
[01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:17.692]  And I guess the question that people here are wondering today is, did they run into somebody that was
[01:48:19.091 --> 01:48:22.712]  A situation like Madoff or one of these other types of situations.
[01:48:22.732 --> 01:48:27.493]  We really don't know and I've put a call into this management firm for a comment.
[01:48:27.553 --> 01:48:28.534]  I haven't heard back.
[01:48:28.894 --> 01:48:33.275]  Oh yeah, I mean you've got all these Madoff type guys running things.
[01:48:33.475 --> 01:48:35.216]  He was the founder of the NASDAQ.
[01:48:35.736 --> 01:48:39.717]  I remember telling folks ten years ago that it was all Ponzi schemes when they got rid of the
[01:48:40.836 --> 01:48:43.477]  The Glass-Steagall Act and was called a conspiracy theorist.
[01:48:44.457 --> 01:48:47.518]  As Northcom openly announced, we're going into basically federal control.
[01:48:48.458 --> 01:48:52.899]  Still, we're being told this, but I just hope good reporters out there like you can get the word out.
[01:48:53.319 --> 01:49:01.741]  Sir, I'd like to talk to you, and the show's over in about two minutes, I'd like to just talk to you off-air for a few minutes and see if you need any other questions answered.
[01:49:01.761 --> 01:49:04.861]  But fire out the Des Moines Register website if folks want to read your latest article.
[01:49:05.301 --> 01:49:07.122]  Well, it's desmoinesregister.com.
[01:49:07.961 --> 01:49:08.401]  Absolutely.
[01:49:08.421 --> 01:49:09.603]  And the headline of that news story?
[01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:16.548]  It's IPERS, colon, $339 million of assets frozen under federal probe.
[01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.329]  Wow.
[01:49:17.569 --> 01:49:18.550]  Okay, I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:49:18.570 --> 01:49:19.471]  We'll come to you in two minutes.
[01:49:19.531 --> 01:49:19.951]  Okay, sir?
[01:49:20.352 --> 01:49:20.512]  Sure.
[01:49:20.912 --> 01:49:21.212]  Thank you.
[01:49:21.232 --> 01:49:24.796]  Appreciate you calling into the show, or that we got in contact with you.
[01:49:24.816 --> 01:49:26.337]  Thank you for that information.
[01:49:26.797 --> 01:49:35.345]  Rebroadcast starts in about a minute and a half, and we have Webster Tarpley on, and we have the fellow who got detained and the Secret Service came for his anti-Obama sign.
[01:49:35.885 --> 01:49:36.686]  This one right here.
[01:49:36.766 --> 01:49:37.446]  He sent it to us.
[01:49:37.786 --> 01:49:38.287]  Copy of it.
[01:49:38.907 --> 01:49:40.388]  And a lot of other key information.
[01:49:40.448 --> 01:49:45.692]  Really important show today, so please listen to the retransmission at InfoWars.com and the re-airing on the MNFM dial.
[01:49:45.992 --> 01:49:48.954]  I want to tell you at the end of the show, don't forget the ObamaDeception.net.

[01:49:58.281 --> 01:50:01.143]  And don't forget another great sponsor, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:50:01.863 --> 01:50:08.467]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:50:08.927 --> 01:50:14.150]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrims for example, when seeds had the highest value of any bartered item, even silver or gold.
[01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:20.353]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[01:50:20.793 --> 01:50:22.854]  Governments are hoarding seeds all over the planet.
[01:50:23.174 --> 01:50:25.255]  Check out survivalseedbank.com.
