[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.821]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:11.402]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:12.962]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:17.143]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.143 --> 00:00:21.204]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:42.022]  We have one of the most prominent members of the Native American Indian Movement, Russell Means, joining us in T-minus 20 minutes to chime in on the parallels between what happened to Native Americans and what's happening in Gaza.
[00:00:42.022 --> 00:00:48.727]  I saw a clip of him earlier this week on YouTube which was very accurate because I too have read the official Nazi histories.
[00:00:48.727 --> 00:00:51.689]  Hitler gave speeches about it, wrote about it.
[00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:52.509]  He got his
[00:00:54.104 --> 00:01:10.132]  policies for death camps and rounding up populations, non-Aryan groups in Russia and all over Europe from the American Indian program here in the United States.
[00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:15.275]  And of course that adopted a lot from those that invented it, the British, the concentration camp.
[00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.876]  It was Andrew Jackson
[00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:27.126]  Who turned around and did some of the same stuff to Native Americans who lost his mother and brother through a British concentration camp.
[00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:34.331]  So Russell Means is joining us, then Bob Chapman for his once a week visit on the economy, and boy is that timely today.
[00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:40.796]  And then for two hours, ladies and gentlemen, we have Alan Watt joining us.
[00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:48.221]  Folks really love it when we have Alan Watt on, we appreciate him coming on the show, and we'll go over a host of issues with Alan Watt today.
[00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:58.799]  On this Friday, the ninth day of January, 2009 edition.
[00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:12.124]  By the way, the Alex Jones Tyranny Crusher 1 Bullhorn auctioned on eBay only a couple days into a seven-day bid is over $50,000 right now.
[00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:21.197]  Now somebody put in one for five million and then bragged that it was fake.
[00:02:21.197 --> 00:02:30.062]  We just googled their handle and found out that it was part of a government group, government affiliated group, laughing openly saying they wanted to screw it up.
[00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:36.666]  But we just cancelled their bid and it's a legitimate cancellation because we have their own handle, their own admission.
[00:02:37.854 --> 00:02:45.580]  Where they're admitting that they are, and even posting their bidding details on the web, posting the evidence of their felony.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.881]  We went and looked it up.
[00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:50.343]  Memory told me it was a felony above $10,000 federal.
[00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:57.488]  In Texas, it's above $6,000 for a state felony, but I don't know what state this individual's in.
[00:02:57.488 --> 00:03:00.491]  You can always subpoena those, but it looks like we'll be able to handle those problems.
[00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:06.035]  We've talked to eBay now, and they did say that if these people did succeed, that there would be criminal charges.
[00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.393]  So, they're not going to be successful in their criminal activities.
[00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:22.539]  They're admitted criminal activities, but they're doing important work, of course, for CENTCOM, so it's okay.
[00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:23.159]  It's alright.
[00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.543]  Yeah, and if you didn't know that you've got some CENTCOM and FBI guys in there with you.
[00:03:28.543 --> 00:03:34.927]  I know some of you are just fellow traveler lobotomy type folks.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.044]  Fluoride heads, your mother's didn't breastfeed you and then you drank fluoride, so your brain's tiny and got rotholes in it.
[00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:42.704]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:03:42.704 --> 00:03:43.585]  Of course, you'll just laugh.
[00:03:43.585 --> 00:03:45.566]  You'll go, well, my mom didn't breastfeed me.
[00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:47.928]  That's true.
[00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:55.153]  But you won't Google and read the BBC and Associated Press about your brain being 15 to 30 percent smaller, depending on the study, if you weren't breastfed.
[00:03:55.153 --> 00:03:57.294]  You'll just laugh and say that's not true.
[00:03:57.294 --> 00:04:02.598]  But I guarantee you, mama puts you in a crib in dirty diapers and didn't take care of you.
[00:04:02.598 --> 00:04:03.539]  And that's your problem.
[00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:10.184]  And I'm sorry they savaged your mind so that you couldn't connect your intellect with your soul.
[00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:15.369]  Alright, I'm already digressing here.
[00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:26.039]  Now you can escape with some of the fluoride and still have an intellect, but if mama doesn't give you that milk, and I'm not bashing women here that believe the system and gave their babies formula.
[00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.343]  I'm saying this so women will think about their children in the future and give them
[00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.733]  What those mammary glands, those beautiful mammary glands, were designed for.
[00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:44.477]  The guys in the control room got a kick out of that little comment.
[00:04:44.477 --> 00:04:46.918]  Yeah!
[00:04:46.918 --> 00:04:49.000]  Fired up!
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.061]  This transmission has just lifted off.
[00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:54.142]  Huge news blitz straight ahead.
[00:04:54.142 --> 00:04:59.325]  Right here on the one, the only InfoWars.com radio network.
[00:04:59.325 --> 00:04:59.966]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.243 --> 00:05:02.904]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:07.667]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:10.629]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.671]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:13.671 --> 00:05:19.794]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:25.378]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[00:05:25.598 --> 00:05:27.419]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.383]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[00:05:31.383 --> 00:05:34.205]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[00:05:34.205 --> 00:05:43.352]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:50.437]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:52.459]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.880]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.581]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[00:06:00.581 --> 00:06:03.822]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:07.183]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:08.983]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[00:06:08.983 --> 00:06:13.064]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[00:06:13.064 --> 00:06:15.505]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared.
[00:06:15.505 --> 00:06:16.325]  Get self-sufficient.
[00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:17.206]  Get food.
[00:06:17.206 --> 00:06:24.735]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:25.936]  And so it's a mindset.
[00:06:25.936 --> 00:06:28.679]  A mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:31.543]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:38.886]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:42.167]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:43.087]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:43.087 --> 00:06:47.309]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:53.571]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:54.672]  Watch the free videos.

[00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:04.919]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.060]  Take action today.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.664]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:17.289]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:21.492]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:21.492 --> 00:07:23.954]  It really is a Central Texas Command Center now.
[00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:31.359]  I'm going to visit family for a few days next week.
[00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:33.680]  So Jason Burmiss is going to be sitting in some.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:45.327]  He's down here in the Central Texas Command Center and he's saying, man, you've got to give people a tour of this place and show them what you did with the support people gave you.
[00:07:45.327 --> 00:07:50.590]  And you know, really, we've just been so busy.
[00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.231]  So busy.
[00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:55.983]  With all the other projects we're doing in this Barack Obama film.
[00:07:55.983 --> 00:08:01.004]  We were up here until about 11 last night and we went and got a hamburger afterwards.
[00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:05.905]  With Rob's cousin who's down here visiting from New York.
[00:08:05.905 --> 00:08:08.806]  That was fun.
[00:08:08.806 --> 00:08:12.066]  But I digress.
[00:08:12.066 --> 00:08:15.107]  Maybe, since it's quick and easy and later we'll do a video tour.
[00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:22.455]  Just take some photos around the new Central Texas Command Center, kind of a photo tour.
[00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:37.741]  And then at some point, I need to walk around with a camera in here and videotape the place and put it out for the viewers out there at PrisonPlanet.tv so they can check out the Command Center.
[00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:45.284]  But we're in the next phase, trying to expand our operations, and so we're so busy that it's hard to get around to that, but we will do it.
[00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:51.762]  That is a guarantee if the creek don't rise, as they say.
[00:08:51.762 --> 00:08:57.786]  Yeah, I usually get up about 6.30, 7 in the morning.
[00:08:57.786 --> 00:09:09.295]  I slept until about 9 o'clock this morning because I didn't get home until about 1 and I'm here with this huge stack of news in front of me and I'm actually in a relaxed mood.
[00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.150]  Which is rare.
[00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.292]  I mean, I'm normally relaxed when I'm not on air.
[00:09:15.292 --> 00:09:27.217]  But for some reason I've gotten the habit over the years, I guess when I first got on radio it was so exciting that I was just exploding with information that I would get into this overdriven mode and that became the precedent.
[00:09:27.217 --> 00:09:34.580]  But right now I'm feeling like my normal self and I don't even know where to start because I have all this serious news and I almost hate to plow through it all.
[00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:41.392]  And bum my happy vibe, as they say, but we won't have a free society.
[00:09:41.392 --> 00:09:47.874]  We won't have any future if we let the criminals come in and eat us out of house and home and our societies.
[00:09:47.874 --> 00:09:49.195]  That's the whole point about corruption.
[00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:49.995]  It must be stopped.
[00:09:49.995 --> 00:09:51.536]  It must be resisted.
[00:09:51.536 --> 00:09:54.257]  Really serious news on the financial front.
[00:09:54.257 --> 00:09:57.618]  This is UBS closing U.S.
[00:09:57.618 --> 00:09:59.939]  clients' offshore accounts.
[00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:07.225]  New York Times reports, and this is a Reuters story itself, under pressure from the U.S.
[00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:15.531]  Tax Authority, Swiss wealth management giant UBS is closing all the offshore accounts of its rich U.S.
[00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.852]  clients, the New York Times said Friday.
[00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:21.575]  Now what's happened is the really big money's moved offshore.
[00:10:21.575 --> 00:10:26.678]  The get-out-of-the-United-States date, I've been told and read about, was about two years ago.
[00:10:26.678 --> 00:10:28.999]  And they've moved their money to Mumbai.
[00:10:31.084 --> 00:10:45.153]  They've moved their money to Dubai, they've moved their money to Luxembourg, they've moved their money to the Bahamas, they've moved their money to Portugal, they've moved their money.
[00:10:45.153 --> 00:10:56.040]  And then you have the OECD, the Organization of Economic Cooperative Development, that was the official name of the Marshall Plan in Europe.
[00:10:57.262 --> 00:11:06.369]  And now it's this international management consortium that really sets a lot of the policies for the private IMF, World Bank, International Bank of Settlements, and others.
[00:11:06.369 --> 00:11:11.653]  And they're the ones that have been pushing for decades to, quote, get rid of tax havens.
[00:11:11.653 --> 00:11:16.197]  But they only get rid of select, quote, tax avoidance havens.
[00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:21.481]  And they only go after the smaller fish, people with a million, two million, five million, a hundred million.
[00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:25.852]  Even a billion, if they're not in the inner circle of elitist.
[00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:27.833]  So this is all about selective enforcement.
[00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:49.299]  The big trillionaires of the world, the super class, the handful of families that control trillions, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, they use governmental taxing authorities to come in and suck the middle class and the nouveau riche and the upstart super rich dry through taxation.
[00:11:51.128 --> 00:12:10.136]  You see these reports all the time, where Goldman Sachs paid less than 1% taxes, that was in the New York Times, in the United States, because they're offshore, and they've written all the federal and international laws where it's allowed, it's kosher for them to do that, but nobody else, except for that small superclass.
[00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:21.284]  And so that's all this is, is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, unless you're a select group allowed to go into the bank accounts in other areas of the world.
[00:12:21.284 --> 00:12:30.827]  So this is a robbing of the middle class, a robbing of the nouveau riche and some upstart super rich.
[00:12:30.827 --> 00:12:33.008]  The looting.
[00:12:33.008 --> 00:12:34.389]  UBS, which the U.S.
[00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:35.069]  authorities say
[00:12:36.633 --> 00:12:45.037]  Helped wealthy Americans hide cash in offshore bank accounts will shut down 19,000 offshore accounts, the paper said, quoting unnamed U.S.
[00:12:45.037 --> 00:12:46.158]  clients.
[00:12:46.158 --> 00:12:49.500]  A UBS spokesman in Switzerland was not immediately available to comment on the report.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:56.003]  The Swiss bank, one of the hardest hit in the credit crisis, decided in July last year to stop offering offshore accounts to U.S.
[00:12:56.003 --> 00:12:57.944]  citizens as it was targeted by a U.S.
[00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:03.187]  tax investigation which challenges Switzerland's famous banking secrecy laws.
[00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:14.512]  Really what happened is the Swiss joined the European Union a few years ago, and they have agreed to phase out their own currency and their gold-backed system, so it's over for them.
[00:13:14.512 --> 00:13:17.094]  They're being absorbed by the board.
[00:13:17.094 --> 00:13:18.295]  As part of the investigation, U.S.
[00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:21.958]  authorities indicted UBS's Wealth Management Chief last year.
[00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:25.881]  UBS is progressing with its closing.
[00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:31.926]  In ordinary fashion, UBS spokesman Karina Byrne was quoted as saying in the U.S.
[00:13:31.926 --> 00:13:32.186]  paper,
[00:13:34.175 --> 00:13:35.215]  And it says it helped U.S.
[00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:38.237]  clients hide $18 billion of untaxed American money.
[00:13:38.237 --> 00:13:42.839]  I mean, there are globalists that are making $18 billion a day, folks.
[00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:48.321]  But they love these illusions and these giant hoaxes that Bill Gates is the richest man in the world.
[00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:55.744]  Bill Gates' father, who headed up Planned Parenthood, is still on their board, and was tied in with IBM Eugenics Operations.
[00:13:55.744 --> 00:13:58.946]  IBM is a trust when the old man died in the
[00:14:00.196 --> 00:14:01.917]  Was it late 40s?
[00:14:01.917 --> 00:14:10.420]  Set up a trust that IBM be used to carry out, setting up a world state to carry out eugenics, and that's on record.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:19.364]  And to get around trust laws, and those are still being somewhat enforced, I'm digressing.
[00:14:19.364 --> 00:14:23.806]  Look, I've covered one article here, and I've probably got 50 or 60 important ones.
[00:14:24.758 --> 00:14:27.180]  It's just all a giant stinking fraud.
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.321]  And so he was set up as the IBM frontman.
[00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:34.445]  And IBM has thousands of fronts that we know of.
[00:14:34.445 --> 00:14:38.348]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:38.348 --> 00:14:43.732]  A lot of these low-level government people and bureaucrats and corporate shills, you don't get to keep your money.
[00:14:44.662 --> 00:14:47.804]  And the general that you stole, many of you, or that you earned.
[00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:54.088]  And then many, of course, the mainline middle class that may have a half million dollars saved up for 30, 40 years of working.
[00:14:54.088 --> 00:14:55.829]  Well, you're just going to lose all that value too.
[00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:56.690]  That's what this is about.
[00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.833]  You think the elites are going to just let you invest in the system and they are not going to steal from you?
[00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:11.440]  You think they're setting up FEMA camps and NORTHCOM command because they want to give you a pedicure or, you know, they want to wash your rock and roll hair?
[00:15:13.032 --> 00:15:17.075]  Because they care about your bling and your escalade?
[00:15:17.075 --> 00:15:18.836]  They'd like to see you dead.
[00:15:18.836 --> 00:15:22.019]  You understand that?
[00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:24.460]  Henry Paulson's a big eugenicist.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.603]  Heading up a bunch of land grabbing operations.
[00:15:27.603 --> 00:15:28.904]  He's a human hater.
[00:15:28.904 --> 00:15:30.605]  Openly calls for population reduction.
[00:15:30.605 --> 00:15:35.549]  I mean, this is a sick group.
[00:15:35.549 --> 00:15:38.411]  So again, all of you that think you're a part of the system, just get ready.
[00:15:39.349 --> 00:15:43.913]  Get ready, because they're going to work you over and they're not going to stop until you stand up against them.
[00:15:43.913 --> 00:15:45.214]  You understand?
[00:15:45.214 --> 00:15:53.541]  They'll push you all the way to the wall and past it if you keep sitting there with your thumb in your little mouth, sucking on it and acting all elitist.
[00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:58.546]  All these wannabe nouveau riche who are arrogant and full of themselves out there.
[00:15:58.546 --> 00:16:00.087]  You know who we're talking about.
[00:16:00.087 --> 00:16:01.728]  From all these little pampered families.
[00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:06.445]  In places like Dallas and Houston and Long Island and L.A.
[00:16:06.445 --> 00:16:10.729]  and, I mean, there's communities of them everywhere who think they're gods and think they're the elite.
[00:16:10.729 --> 00:16:11.769]  Get ready.
[00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:20.716]  The elite is going to take everything you've got and then probably shove a gun in the back of your head and splatter your brains down into a pit before they kick you into it.
[00:16:20.716 --> 00:16:25.139]  The last thing you'll do before you die is crap yourselves.
[00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:28.502]  Bill Gross, we've got a Ponzi style economy.
[00:16:30.595 --> 00:16:39.960]  Bill Gross is managing director of the world's largest bond fund, PIMCO, which manages some $790 billion in assets.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:45.503]  PIMCO is managing the commercial paper assets for the Federal Reserve as part of the government's commercial paper funding facility.
[00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:58.428]  He wrote in the January 2009 Investment Outlook that it's not only Madoff who ran a Ponzi scheme, but the entire U.S.
[00:16:58.428 --> 00:17:00.570]  economy in a Ponzi-like scheme.
[00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.513]  He calls it our Ponzi-style economy.
[00:17:04.513 --> 00:17:07.596]  And we have a link up on PrisonPlanet.com with the rest of the article.
[00:17:07.596 --> 00:17:11.159]  And you've got a lot of these insiders now acting like they weren't part of it.
[00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:12.660]  You know, he's now blowing the whistle.
[00:17:15.525 --> 00:17:20.869]  All a Ponzi scheme, while the Ponzi scheme still had value because of people's perceptions.
[00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:25.652]  They bought up all the defense contractors, all the major media, all the major infrastructure.
[00:17:25.652 --> 00:17:29.035]  Now they don't need you anymore.
[00:17:29.035 --> 00:17:35.619]  They pumped you full of yourself and told you you were the elite and got you all arrogant and slack-jawed and smiley-faced.
[00:17:35.619 --> 00:17:38.221]  You know the spirit I'm talking about.
[00:17:38.221 --> 00:17:39.002]  The attitude.
[00:17:40.185 --> 00:18:03.865]  The cowardly attitude of these little metrosexual men out there today and all of these preening, psycho, worldly women who have had more abortions than they've, I don't know, bought cars in their lives.
[00:18:03.865 --> 00:18:06.748]  You know, they get an abortion every two years, they get a new car every two years.
[00:18:08.117 --> 00:18:09.317]  You didn't care about that baby?
[00:18:09.317 --> 00:18:13.099]  Well, the elite doesn't care about you either, honey.
[00:18:13.099 --> 00:18:14.699]  That baby wasn't a human being?
[00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:18.380]  Well, you're not either to them.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.821]  You're not either.
[00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:26.543]  Speaking of that, baby selected without cancer gene.
[00:18:29.068 --> 00:18:30.709]  And this is out of the Associated Press.
[00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:36.653]  The first British baby genetically selected to be free of breast cancer gene has been born, doctors have said.
[00:18:36.653 --> 00:18:40.676]  She grew from an embryo screened, that means the other embryos were thrown out.
[00:18:40.676 --> 00:18:50.662]  She grew from an embryo screened to ensure, that means little baby, to ensure it did not contain the faulty BRCA1 gene, which passes the risk of breast cancer down generations.
[00:18:50.662 --> 00:18:53.404]  But you see, I've read the geneticist studies.
[00:18:53.404 --> 00:18:58.388]  A lot of these cancer genes are tied to other genes that actually help us.
[00:18:59.248 --> 00:19:03.911]  So you watch, these people that are designer, they're gonna have all sorts of problems.
[00:19:03.911 --> 00:19:05.232]  Just watch.
[00:19:05.232 --> 00:19:06.633]  Just watch.
[00:19:06.633 --> 00:19:07.214]  Stay with us.
[00:19:09.011 --> 00:19:12.472]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:19:12.472 --> 00:19:16.253]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:19:16.253 --> 00:19:22.554]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:19:22.554 --> 00:19:27.195]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:19:27.195 --> 00:19:33.216]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:19:33.216 --> 00:19:36.637]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:19:36.637 --> 00:19:37.317]  Run sump pumps,
[00:19:37.637 --> 00:19:37.957]  I think so.
[00:19:58.302 --> 00:19:58.562]  Good day.
[00:19:58.562 --> 00:19:59.983]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:19:59.983 --> 00:20:00.384]  January 9, 2009.
[00:20:00.384 --> 00:20:01.765]  Gold opened this morning at $8.5690.
[00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:06.668]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $8.8220, $4.4110 for the half ounce, and $2.2055 for a quarter ounce.
[00:20:06.668 --> 00:20:07.389]  That's $8.8220, $4.4110, and $2.2055.
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.281]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:20:31.281 --> 00:20:34.382]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:20:34.382 --> 00:20:43.864]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:20:43.864 --> 00:20:49.186]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:20:49.673 --> 00:20:52.034]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:20:52.034 --> 00:20:54.875]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:58.257]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:02.019]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:04.640]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.701]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:15.985]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:15.985 --> 00:21:17.646]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:18.638 --> 00:21:20.179]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:20.979]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:21.979]  This is his M.O.
[00:21:21.979 --> 00:21:23.320]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.340]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:32.483]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:32.483 --> 00:21:32.963]  Some U.S.
[00:21:32.963 --> 00:21:38.605]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:39.305 --> 00:21:43.187]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:43.187 --> 00:21:53.292]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:53.292 --> 00:21:54.512]  Fabled enemies.
[00:21:54.512 --> 00:22:02.276]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:05.618]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:09.306 --> 00:22:12.548]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[00:22:12.548 --> 00:22:14.890]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.492]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[00:22:18.492 --> 00:22:19.433]  Be smart.
[00:22:19.433 --> 00:22:20.413]  Be safe.
[00:22:20.413 --> 00:22:22.595]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.
[00:22:22.595 --> 00:22:28.419]  Pepperspray.com is the only website you'll ever need for all your non-lethal self-defense supplies.
[00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:38.105]  Pepperspray.com carries one of the largest assortments of pepper spray and personal safety products on the web, including mace, animal repellents, stun guns, and tasers.
[00:22:38.345 --> 00:22:44.491]  Pepperspray.com also carries a large assortment of products for personal, home, child, and pet safety.
[00:22:44.491 --> 00:22:48.955]  Pepperspray.com is proud to feature Sabre brand Pink Ribbon Pepperspray.

[00:23:03.426 --> 00:23:04.386]  Or call 1-800-908-9988.
[00:23:04.386 --> 00:23:04.807]  Call today.
[00:23:04.807 --> 00:23:07.348]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth.
[00:23:07.348 --> 00:23:11.870]  He can do it as he please.
[00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.492]  And if things don't change soon, he will.
[00:23:37.163 --> 00:23:44.147]  Russell Means is our guest for the next 35 minutes or so, and when I get back to town I want to get him back for a full hour.
[00:23:44.147 --> 00:23:46.288]  We tried to go over his whole bio, it would take hours.
[00:23:46.288 --> 00:23:54.552]  He's well known for being in a lot of big Hollywood movies, but he's more proud of the fact that he's been one of the main leaders of the American Indian movement,
[00:23:56.869 --> 00:24:04.496]  And of course as a writer and involved in a lot of other important work, he was born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.
[00:24:04.496 --> 00:24:17.188]  Both his parents had been educated in government re-education camps and he of course is trying to get
[00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:25.132]  The people around the Dakotas area to secede, not from the U.S.
[00:24:25.132 --> 00:24:27.392]  It's now totally new world order.
[00:24:27.392 --> 00:24:28.552]  It's not even the United States.
[00:24:28.552 --> 00:24:33.773]  It's this global empire that's taken over even the little empire that was called the United States here.
[00:24:33.773 --> 00:24:36.354]  And that's gotten international attention.
[00:24:36.354 --> 00:24:37.654]  They've had some success.
[00:24:37.654 --> 00:24:44.836]  But I saw on his YouTube channel a few days ago, and it was very touching, where he was laying out, because I've studied the history as well, the fact that
[00:24:45.998 --> 00:24:49.201]  Well, really what happened is the British invented concentration camps.
[00:24:49.201 --> 00:25:00.433]  Andrew Jackson, who then put Native Americans in camps himself, his mother and his brother died in a British concentration camp during the Revolutionary War.
[00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:02.635]  So the British invented it.
[00:25:02.635 --> 00:25:04.696]  They actually did it to the Scots first.
[00:25:04.696 --> 00:25:08.639]  You see some similar things in the movie Braveheart that's somewhat historical.
[00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:10.200]  So people are always doing this to their neighbors.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.103]  This is what happens to the more technological groups come in and dominate and kill.
[00:25:14.103 --> 00:25:21.669]  And then he ties it in with Hitler who bragged that he learned everything he knew off the American Indian model with what the army did.
[00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:24.331]  Especially out west but also in the east.
[00:25:25.091 --> 00:25:25.812]  Thank you.
[00:25:25.812 --> 00:25:27.112]  Great to be with you.
[00:25:27.112 --> 00:25:27.993]  Well, first of all, I want to
[00:25:54.807 --> 00:26:06.110]  I know that people listen to your show quite regularly, and they heard me back last year when you had me on after we withdrew.
[00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.070]  We didn't secede.
[00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:18.153]  We withdrew from our treaties with the United States of America and re-established our free and independent republic, the Republic of Lakota.
[00:26:18.153 --> 00:26:22.534]  And as an update on the Republic of Lakota, is that
[00:26:23.596 --> 00:26:40.230]  Number one, we have devised four strategies for the rebuilding of the foundation of our Republic, and that's politics, health, education, and economics.
[00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:47.156]  And economics, as we all know, is those that control the energy control the economics.
[00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:52.400]  We live in the Republic of Lakota, which also goes into
[00:26:53.052 --> 00:27:03.361]  Two states of Dakota, and that part of Dakota is called by the experts, the Saudi Arabia of wind energy.
[00:27:03.361 --> 00:27:09.966]  And of course the coal companies hold hostage the energy in the West.
[00:27:09.966 --> 00:27:16.792]  Consequently, you have to get permission from them if you want to put up a windmill.
[00:27:16.792 --> 00:27:19.334]  However, we're going to build our own grid.
[00:27:19.975 --> 00:27:38.761]  And where we begin our endeavors, and we've started that already in the Republic, is single house windmill independence and community independence with wind turbines.
[00:27:38.761 --> 00:27:46.243]  Wind turbines will allow our communities to be free, and because of that, investors will be drawn to
[00:27:48.382 --> 00:28:04.269]  The Republic of Lakota to invest in building our own grid, which we can then mother in with the other grids, but we control our own grids and costs and profits.
[00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:06.590]  That is one of the endeavors we're doing.
[00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:15.534]  The other endeavor is to be putting up working with the international community and international corporations.
[00:28:15.534 --> 00:28:16.835]  We are going to be putting in
[00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:31.972]  A computer calling center that is going to be expanding within five to six years to a $600 million a year operation.
[00:28:31.972 --> 00:28:40.800]  Insofar as our health is concerned, we're bringing in naturopathic doctors as well as MDs from different parts of the world.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.542]  We are presently arranging
[00:28:44.686 --> 00:28:54.530]  Um, medical training for Indian students who are not allowed into medical schools or once they get in there, they're, um... Okay, stay there.
[00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.090]  We got a break, Russell Means.
[00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.511]  Stay there.
[00:28:56.511 --> 00:28:59.192]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.192 --> 00:29:00.592]  We're on the march.
[00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:03.113]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:03.113 --> 00:29:09.636]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:09.636 --> 00:29:11.036]  It is a big idea.
[00:29:11.036 --> 00:29:13.117]  A new world order.
[00:29:13.863 --> 00:29:19.085]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:29:19.085 --> 00:29:21.587]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:29:21.587 --> 00:29:24.368]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:29:24.368 --> 00:29:27.549]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:34.873]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:29:37.904 --> 00:29:43.348]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:47.230]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.792]  Bill Ferguson making great progress toward a world government.
[00:29:49.792 --> 00:29:50.953]  Most people have no idea.
[00:29:50.953 --> 00:29:51.733]  They're not after money.
[00:29:51.733 --> 00:29:53.014]  They have all the money they need.
[00:29:53.014 --> 00:29:53.995]  They're after power.
[00:29:53.995 --> 00:29:55.136]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:30:06.663 --> 00:30:07.724]  You have been warned.
[00:30:08.905 --> 00:30:12.429]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:30:12.429 --> 00:30:17.834]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:30:17.834 --> 00:30:22.539]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.

[00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:23.352]  It's true.

[00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:31.515]  I think so.
[00:32:47.864 --> 00:33:00.179]  The days are bright and filled with pain Enclose me in your gentle reign The time you
[00:33:08.681 --> 00:33:11.962]  I promise to have Russell Means on for a full hour if he can do it.
[00:33:11.962 --> 00:33:20.706]  To talk about, since the last time we had him on 8-9 months ago, the progress of their withdrawal, their cancelling of treaties that have never been followed.
[00:33:20.706 --> 00:33:22.087]  He's right, it's not a secession.
[00:33:23.066 --> 00:33:25.868]  I'm glad he corrected me on that technical point.
[00:33:25.868 --> 00:33:33.774]  I want to shift gears in the time we have left with him on the parallels between what's happening to the Gazans because they're dead and dying right now.
[00:33:33.774 --> 00:33:36.436]  Gaza children found with mother's corpses.
[00:33:36.436 --> 00:33:44.982]  The New York Times, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Thursday it had discovered shocking scenes including small children next to their mother's corpses.
[00:33:46.479 --> 00:33:48.662]  Well at least with a wounded knee they killed all the kids too.
[00:34:01.599 --> 00:34:03.440]  Israel founded Hamas.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.320]  That's on the record.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.321]  People keep emailing me saying it's not true.
[00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:07.902]  They founded it to counter the PLO.
[00:34:07.902 --> 00:34:09.102]  That's on record.
[00:34:09.102 --> 00:34:11.123]  See, they didn't want a mainline secular group.
[00:34:11.123 --> 00:34:12.724]  That's why they overthrew Saddam.
[00:34:12.724 --> 00:34:18.126]  They want radicalized groups so that they'll fight back with their sticks and stones.
[00:34:18.986 --> 00:34:21.126]  So they have a pretext to come in and slaughter them.
[00:34:21.126 --> 00:34:28.928]  But then the argument is, well, then they're just put in camps and, you know, basically their wells are poisoned, so what's the point there?
[00:34:28.928 --> 00:34:31.188]  And that's why the other groups say, let's go ahead and fight.
[00:34:31.188 --> 00:34:33.148]  Unless Russell Means has his take on that.
[00:34:33.148 --> 00:34:35.609]  He's certainly been involved fighting.
[00:34:35.609 --> 00:34:39.530]  And Pat Buchanan says, Israel turning Gaza into a concentration camp.
[00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.710]  Then MSNBC jumped on him and said, how dare you compare this to Hitler?
[00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:45.451]  And he said, hey, the British invented concentration camps.
[00:34:45.451 --> 00:34:47.911]  I didn't say death camp, but it is a death camp.
[00:34:49.616 --> 00:34:53.258]  Also, Obama saying to face Iran nuclear crisis in the first year.
[00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:56.180]  Israel saying, Obama saying they may attack Iran.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:02.264]  UN accuses Israel of herding 110 Palestinians into a house and then shelling it, leaving 30 dead.
[00:35:02.264 --> 00:35:04.906]  There's scores of witnesses and survivors.
[00:35:04.906 --> 00:35:08.969]  Russell Means, that's just some of what we've got today as I go over that news.
[00:35:08.969 --> 00:35:18.395]  With your perspective on this, sir, because Israel is saying, they learned this from the United States, and is saying, hey, you did this to your Native Americans, why not?
[00:35:20.235 --> 00:35:26.316]  Well, first of all, it's just, it's a caveman mentality, all this violence.
[00:35:26.316 --> 00:35:39.739]  You know, the United States, every patriarchal regime in the past, it's over 6,000 years that patriarchy has been in existence, has made the same mistake over and over and over again.
[00:35:39.739 --> 00:35:45.480]  Patriarchy is a fear-based society that, because it's fear-based,
[00:35:45.971 --> 00:35:51.852]  It believes that it's always under attack, the individual patriarch and his holdings.
[00:35:51.852 --> 00:35:58.354]  Therefore, he has the caveman mentality of settling misunderstandings with the club.
[00:35:58.354 --> 00:36:05.575]  Albeit, as time marches on, they are more sophisticated than technological clubs.
[00:36:05.575 --> 00:36:08.976]  They're clubs, nevertheless, and the mentality never changes.
[00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:13.037]  So when you see these attacks on innocent people,
[00:36:14.016 --> 00:36:28.824]  I don't care throughout history but specifically now because the United States Empire and in fact the entire money system is collapsing as we speak.
[00:36:28.824 --> 00:36:32.126]  You'll see them revert to this caveman mentality.
[00:36:32.126 --> 00:36:33.267]  That's why I've always said
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:47.906]  We have to take an honest and truthful look at patriarchy and come up with another way of not allowing men to be solely in charge because they blow it every time.
[00:36:47.906 --> 00:36:57.051]  What happened to the Roman Empire is now happening to the American Empire and the industrial empire around the world.
[00:36:57.051 --> 00:37:01.913]  For instance, if China and Saudi Arabia were calling their treasury notes,
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.702]  That they've bought from the U.S.
[00:37:04.702 --> 00:37:08.844]  so they could bankroll their wars.
[00:37:08.844 --> 00:37:12.767]  America would go broke, would go bankrupt right away.
[00:37:12.767 --> 00:37:16.930]  They cannot pay up their obligations.
[00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:31.620]  The fact that the banking system, now that the Queen of England is broke, she used to be the richest, along with the Rothschilds and the Billion Burgers Syndicate and the Trilateral Commission members,
[00:37:32.831 --> 00:37:56.415]  All of those people are now in it, and the world is collapsing, so it's going to be everything we feared, everything those, ah, I forgot the survivalists back in the 70s and 80s were doing when they were training and doing all sorts of idiotic things out of fear.
[00:37:56.415 --> 00:38:00.176]  They were pressing... These things might become true!
[00:38:00.176 --> 00:38:00.736]  You've got
[00:38:01.607 --> 00:38:08.353]  You've got the United States of America buying its own money from the Fed.
[00:38:08.353 --> 00:38:13.317]  It blows my mind that we as a people are so stupid.
[00:38:13.317 --> 00:38:18.681]  I call that paying to be a slave.
[00:38:18.681 --> 00:38:20.542]  Right.
[00:38:20.542 --> 00:38:26.567]  But here's what Meyer Rothschild said back in the 1700s.
[00:38:30.876 --> 00:38:34.937]  He said, um, let me see.
[00:38:34.937 --> 00:38:35.857]  I'm trying to find it.
[00:38:35.857 --> 00:38:39.178]  Uh, I don't have it.
[00:38:39.178 --> 00:38:40.698]  Oh, I said, here he is.
[00:38:40.698 --> 00:38:44.099]  Give me control of a nation's money.
[00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:48.660]  And I care not who makes her laws.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.801]  That's Rothschild.
[00:38:49.801 --> 00:38:57.643]  Now the Rothschild, um, banking system is what gave birth to all banking systems.
[00:38:57.643 --> 00:38:59.163]  And now they're all one.
[00:39:00.453 --> 00:39:17.521]  So that's why, now with Obama in there, and he just said a couple of days ago in his news conference that over trillion dollar deficits will be here for years to come, printing phony money.
[00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:27.106]  It's going to eventually, and the sooner the better, that this collapse happens so that we can face reality and get on with life.
[00:39:27.106 --> 00:39:30.087]  But to strangle us to death like they're doing,
[00:39:30.908 --> 00:39:36.310]  With their greed and their monetizing everything.
[00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:39.091]  They monetize prisoners in prison.
[00:39:39.091 --> 00:39:42.193]  They've monetized every entity.
[00:39:42.193 --> 00:39:48.155]  Did you know that the reservations, the Indian concentration camps are monetized?
[00:39:48.155 --> 00:39:48.295]  Yes.
[00:39:48.295 --> 00:39:59.260]  If you look on Dun & Bradstreet... No, listen, Russell, I would tell people this ten years ago, or longer, that they had bonds, that they were selling
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.821]  I don't
[00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:31.878]  Again, now this predatory system isn't even so much racially based, it's money based by this international elite, and they are just savaging everyone.
[00:40:31.878 --> 00:40:34.180]  Oh, yes.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:43.327]  But what gets me, in their bookkeeping, if you call it that, they call it quasi-money.
[00:40:43.327 --> 00:40:46.890]  All this value brought out of thin air.
[00:40:48.217 --> 00:40:48.658]  That's right.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.601]  That's exactly right.
[00:41:09.601 --> 00:41:11.343]  And you know, the United States utilizing
[00:41:36.195 --> 00:41:39.977]  Israel as their shock troops in the Middle East.
[00:41:39.977 --> 00:41:41.478]  That is so pathetic.
[00:41:41.478 --> 00:41:54.745]  I've never understood that as soon as there's a scarcity of a natural, um, uh, some natural resource, they go military.
[00:41:54.745 --> 00:42:03.349]  They start the bombing and, and the, uh, they taking the prisoners and the slaughters and all of that only because
[00:42:04.634 --> 00:42:05.014]  I think?
[00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.810]  Well, it continues.
[00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:30.652]  Well, Russell, there's a quote I saw on YouTube by a famous chief, isn't it?
[00:42:30.652 --> 00:42:31.852]  Can you give us that quote?
[00:42:31.852 --> 00:42:32.692]  You got memorized?
[00:42:32.692 --> 00:42:43.815]  Yes, that's just before Chief Seattle and the Suquamish people of the Suquamish Nation in and around the state of Washington.
[00:42:43.815 --> 00:42:52.497]  Just before they were marched off from their homeland to a concentration camp slash reservation, he gave a speech.
[00:42:53.559 --> 00:43:05.606]  And in that speech, and in part, he said, he's talking to the commissioners from, the treaty commissioners from Washington, D.C., the government.
[00:43:05.606 --> 00:43:09.608]  He said, your time of decay may be distant.
[00:43:09.608 --> 00:43:12.710]  It's like the waves of the sea.
[00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:16.792]  It is the order of nature and regret is useless.
[00:43:16.792 --> 00:43:20.534]  Your time of decay may be distant, but it will surely come.
[00:43:22.267 --> 00:43:30.815]  For even the white man's God who walked and talked with him as friend with friend could not escape our common destiny.
[00:43:30.815 --> 00:43:33.158]  We may be brothers after all.
[00:43:33.158 --> 00:43:36.661]  We shall see.
[00:43:36.661 --> 00:43:37.922]  That's Chief Seattle.
[00:43:37.922 --> 00:43:44.769]  What a prescient statement, understanding that the very evil you're carrying out is going to come back and bite you in the butt.
[00:43:44.769 --> 00:43:45.289]  There you go.
[00:43:46.428 --> 00:43:50.191]  And that what goes around comes around.
[00:43:50.191 --> 00:43:55.314]  We're going to be brothers in being murdered and enslaved.
[00:43:55.314 --> 00:43:57.636]  Exactly.
[00:43:57.636 --> 00:44:14.308]  And it's sad that when Kerry, and I have no respect for Kerry, the former presidential candidate at the Democratic Senate, when he was caught saying words to the effect that
[00:44:15.163 --> 00:44:21.367]  If you're poor, you're going to end up in Iraq and worse to that effect.
[00:44:21.367 --> 00:44:29.473]  And he was chastised by the national media and forced to apologize, but he's virtually correct.
[00:44:29.473 --> 00:44:37.519]  As long as they can keep federal control of the schools and dumbing down America and keep you so dumb that and poor,
[00:44:38.143 --> 00:44:44.794]  That you'll be willing to risk your life for a few crummy dollars that aren't worth anything anyway.
[00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:57.845]  Well, I mean, the public schooling as we know it, with the re-education, the shaved heads, the control, the federal public schooling began for natives.
[00:44:57.845 --> 00:45:10.873]  Why don't you briefly explain what the reservation system, what the boarding schools really were, and that's what our public schools with fences and drug dogs and zero tolerance are turning into, and tie that in, as you did eloquently, to
[00:45:12.216 --> 00:45:13.957]  You know, to the Native American experience.
[00:45:13.957 --> 00:45:18.319]  And again, Israel saying they're carrying that out now against the Palestinians.
[00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:19.039]  Exactly.
[00:45:19.039 --> 00:45:20.560]  Every policy.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:27.603]  And that's why I say the American people are the American Indians of the 21st century.
[00:45:27.603 --> 00:45:37.807]  Because everything that the United States does has been bred and born and practiced on an Indian reservation before exported to the world.
[00:45:38.331 --> 00:45:42.694]  And now it's been brought home to roost on the backs of the American people.
[00:45:42.694 --> 00:45:48.697]  All these policies, health, education, land policies.
[00:45:48.697 --> 00:45:53.179]  Don't you think this credit crunch is getting rid of the family farmers and family ranches?
[00:45:53.179 --> 00:45:55.841]  They are the backbone of America.
[00:45:55.841 --> 00:46:05.687]  And yet, we're allowing that to happen because this credit crunch, that's all farms and ranches, family ranches and family farms run on.
[00:46:05.687 --> 00:46:07.968]  So consequently, they're going to be squeezed out
[00:46:08.487 --> 00:46:10.469]  And the corporate farming is coming in.
[00:46:10.469 --> 00:46:11.029]  I don't care.
[00:46:11.029 --> 00:46:16.954]  Right-wing socialism eventually comes around and meets left-wing socialism.
[00:46:16.954 --> 00:46:18.695]  It's one and the same.
[00:46:18.695 --> 00:46:23.359]  It's just a different application and priority of spending.
[00:46:23.359 --> 00:46:25.501]  Now, it's really just domesticating.
[00:46:25.501 --> 00:46:34.208]  I mean, they claim it's socialism, but it's only so big corporations get control, and then say, here's socialism, have a poison blanket, you know, have a smallpox blanket.
[00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:37.931]  Now, it's have a MMR shot full of cancer viruses.
[00:46:39.786 --> 00:46:41.507]  Very definitely, yes.
[00:46:41.507 --> 00:46:49.012]  And the boarding school system instituted upon my parents and the Indian people up until then.
[00:46:49.012 --> 00:46:53.374]  Still, there's some boarding schools going on in America today.
[00:46:53.374 --> 00:47:03.680]  Sir, as you know, it just came out a few years ago in Canada that they're killing the Native Americans up there and sterilizing them still.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.681]  Exactly.
[00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:06.622]  And you know, in a four-year period in the 70s,
[00:47:07.768 --> 00:47:22.080]  The federal government was caught by the American Indian Movement and a woman by the name of Dr. Connie Urey sterilizing 42% of American Indian women in that four-year period of childbearing age.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.401]  Unbelievable.
[00:47:23.401 --> 00:47:23.581]  42%.
[00:47:23.581 --> 00:47:30.406]  At the same time, they did 35% of Puerto Rican women in Puerto Rico.
[00:47:30.406 --> 00:47:37.212]  So this is the policy America has fostered on Americans.
[00:47:37.839 --> 00:47:39.440]  And now everybody's getting that.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:50.830]  Why is it the, uh, the populations are going, these manufactured, uh, uh, flus forcing us to take flu shots.
[00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:58.156]  Um, and now, you know, we were just absolute slaves with that birth certificate and social security card now.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:08.305]  Well, that's why I know you are succeeding, and I hope you succeed big time, so there is a place to go to when everything collapses.
[00:48:08.305 --> 00:48:18.791]  But then, we know they'll probably just bring military in, but you guys will have a legal right, if they try to get violent, to say no, because you're allowed to pull out of a treaty that's been broken.
[00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:30.318]  Right, but there are other countries that are not wholly a part of the IMF system, the World Bank system.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.201]  of finance.
[00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:56.930]  And those countries like Russia, those countries and others that are not part of the banking system, the wholeheartedly in the world, are going to have something to say as the United States continues to disintegrate and become part and parcel of the United Nations, you know?
[00:48:58.416 --> 00:49:07.343]  That's why they hang on to the United Nations, and another reason is that's where they've been shunted.
[00:49:07.343 --> 00:49:10.105]  Their empire has been shunted into the United Nations.
[00:49:10.105 --> 00:49:12.146]  Well, it's not just decay.
[00:49:12.146 --> 00:49:17.150]  These worms of corruptions, you know, before, they would at least try to keep the host alive.
[00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:22.874]  They got so greedy and so evil, they now basically have killed the host.
[00:49:22.874 --> 00:49:23.395]  Exactly!
[00:49:27.083 --> 00:49:36.629]  As much as unions have been vilified, they were the first to see what was happening, and no one listened to them.
[00:49:36.629 --> 00:49:48.878]  They said as soon as they, you know, the powers that be in Wall Street and other places, financial places, they're the ones who emptied out America.
[00:49:48.878 --> 00:49:50.479]  We have nothing to fall back on.
[00:49:51.286 --> 00:49:52.027]  Nothing.
[00:49:52.027 --> 00:49:54.689]  Just as they did to the Native Americans, it's for total control.
[00:49:54.689 --> 00:49:56.070]  Stay there, Russell Means.
[00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.052]  Again, they want you broke back.
[00:49:58.052 --> 00:50:04.278]  They want you controlled, institutionalized in the modern reservations slash plantations.
[00:50:04.278 --> 00:50:07.461]  But now they're entering a new phase where they just want to exterminate 80% of us.
[00:50:09.252 --> 00:50:12.753]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:50:12.753 --> 00:50:14.673]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:50:14.673 --> 00:50:20.234]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:50:20.234 --> 00:50:28.256]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:50:28.256 --> 00:50:34.957]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical
[00:50:34.957 --> 00:50:35.297]  We're good.

[00:50:57.214 --> 00:50:59.455]  That's r-charge.com.

[00:51:03.276 --> 00:51:05.276]  That's 989-637-4179.
[00:51:05.276 --> 00:51:09.257]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[00:51:09.257 --> 00:51:15.999]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:15.999 --> 00:51:17.660]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:18.655 --> 00:51:20.196]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:20.196 --> 00:51:20.996]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:20.996 --> 00:51:21.976]  This is his M.O.
[00:51:21.976 --> 00:51:23.357]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:23.357 --> 00:51:25.357]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:25.357 --> 00:51:32.500]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:32.980]  Some U.S.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:38.622]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:39.322 --> 00:51:43.204]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:43.204 --> 00:51:53.310]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.531]  Fabled enemies.
[00:51:54.531 --> 00:52:02.276]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:02.276 --> 00:52:05.638]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:18.310]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:26.477]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:52:26.477 --> 00:52:26.797]  In fact,
[00:52:26.857 --> 00:52:31.059]  And clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:52:31.059 --> 00:52:33.821]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:52:33.821 --> 00:52:45.388]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:52:45.388 --> 00:52:51.832]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[00:52:51.832 --> 00:52:55.554]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[00:52:55.754 --> 00:52:59.719]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[00:53:02.662 --> 00:53:04.504]  Again, that's FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:53:04.504 --> 00:53:05.004]  Or call 888-949-3570.
[00:53:05.004 --> 00:53:07.087]  Any way you cut it, the Palestinians are driven out.
[00:53:16.653 --> 00:53:27.510]  They were living in peace with the Jews and Christians, and they were driven out, their markets being shot and bombed, their wells being poisoned, to the edges of what is Israel today.
[00:53:28.507 --> 00:53:33.291]  And then when they're under siege, they try to respond as a bargaining chip with these rockets.
[00:53:33.291 --> 00:53:36.674]  And Israel broke the ceasefire, bombing them.
[00:53:36.674 --> 00:53:39.116]  And our media just lies, because it isn't our media.
[00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:40.598]  It's a globalist corporate media.
[00:53:40.598 --> 00:53:46.983]  We're going to have Russell Means, one of the chief leaders of the Native American movement here in the United States, back on in the near future.
[00:53:46.983 --> 00:53:48.324]  In the four minutes we've got left, sir,
[00:53:50.475 --> 00:53:54.236]  Yes, first of all, what's going to happen in the forthcoming years
[00:54:20.837 --> 00:54:39.410]  And because we're not coming out of this, is that the United States of America, under Obama, is going to continue to try to hang on by their fingernails to their quasi-power by printing phony money.
[00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:50.258]  And eventually, we're going to end up like Germany did after World War I. And that is, we're going to take a wheelbarrow full
[00:54:51.002 --> 00:54:54.884]  of paper money to buy a loaf of bread.
[00:54:54.884 --> 00:54:59.465]  That actually happened in Germany, and it's going to happen here.
[00:54:59.465 --> 00:55:08.209]  You cannot continually cheapen the money without the house of cards falling down on you.
[00:55:08.209 --> 00:55:10.690]  And that's exactly what's going to be happening.
[00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:12.250]  And it's just going to get worse.
[00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:16.872]  They're not going to really look at Obama's plan.
[00:55:16.872 --> 00:55:18.813]  And it's not about the people.
[00:55:20.043 --> 00:55:27.788]  It's only about strengthening the already failing business system.
[00:55:27.788 --> 00:55:34.092]  You can't have a consumer society when the consumers have no money.
[00:55:34.092 --> 00:55:35.674]  It's idiotic.
[00:55:35.674 --> 00:55:37.395]  It's insanity.
[00:55:37.395 --> 00:55:42.738]  Obama and his henchmen and women are insane.
[00:55:42.738 --> 00:55:44.680]  And that's all there is to it.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.881]  Men, patriarchs, are insane.
[00:55:49.801 --> 00:55:59.104]  My websites are www.RepublicofLakota.com and www.RussellMeansFreedom.com.
[00:55:59.104 --> 00:56:04.285]  www.RussellMeansFreedom.com and www.RepublicofLakota.com.
[00:56:04.285 --> 00:56:10.827]  And for those that don't know how to spell Lakota, would you spell that for people please, sir?
[00:56:10.827 --> 00:56:15.329]  Lakota is spelled L-A-K-O-T-A-H.
[00:56:17.645 --> 00:56:21.741]  You can spell it without an H or with an H. L-A-K-O-T-A.
[00:56:24.294 --> 00:56:45.080]  And I promise, sir, we'll have you back up in the near future to go more into Obama and separately more into what you sovereign folks are doing out there in your area of the lower 48 with those four states that are clearly your land and glad to see what you're doing out there because the United States doesn't even exist anymore.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.960]  We're a holding of the internationalists.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.561]  That was the final caveat I would add.
[00:56:49.426 --> 00:56:50.386]  Yes, that's for sure.
[00:56:50.386 --> 00:56:51.967]  Bank robberies are already up 80% in this country.
[00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:18.871]  It's all beginning.
[00:57:18.871 --> 00:57:24.194]  We're going back to the 30s and worse.
[00:57:24.194 --> 00:57:33.319]  What's the term in your native tongue for collapse?
[00:57:33.319 --> 00:57:35.580]  One each.
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.321]  One each.
[00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:40.963]  Which means, of course, nothing.
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:43.561]  All right.
[00:57:43.561 --> 00:57:50.447]  Russell, let me say bye to you during this break, and we'll talk to you again soon.
[00:57:50.447 --> 00:57:53.971]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:56.273]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:57:59.122 --> 00:58:01.143]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:58:01.143 --> 00:58:03.685]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:58:03.685 --> 00:58:06.286]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:58:06.286 --> 00:58:07.487]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:58:07.487 --> 00:58:09.208]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:58:09.208 --> 00:58:12.089]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:58:12.089 --> 00:58:16.472]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:58:16.472 --> 00:58:17.292]  Do you listen?
[00:58:25.397 --> 00:58:30.241]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:58:30.241 --> 00:58:31.342]  An inside job.
[00:58:34.042 --> 00:58:35.543]  How dare you?
[00:58:35.543 --> 00:58:41.565]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:58:41.565 --> 00:58:44.026]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:58:44.026 --> 00:58:50.669]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:58:50.669 --> 00:58:53.770]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:56.031]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:58:56.031 --> 00:58:58.492]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:59:01.653 --> 00:59:04.035]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:04.035 --> 00:59:13.540]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.861]  Big Brother.
[00:59:14.861 --> 00:59:16.622]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:16.622 --> 00:59:18.383]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:18.383 --> 00:59:19.964]  You want answers?
[00:59:19.964 --> 00:59:21.525]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:21.525 --> 00:59:25.707]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:25.707 --> 00:59:29.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:31.058 --> 00:59:36.682]  We've got Alan Watt for two hours and open phones with him coming up in T-minus 60 minutes.
[00:59:36.682 --> 00:59:42.787]  After the next break, we're going to have Bob Chapman, who joins us every Friday for about 50 minutes, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:59:42.787 --> 00:59:44.008]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:44.008 --> 00:59:47.330]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:57.718]  But I wanted to play part of a Russia Today interview with Peter Schiff, where he really boils it down and likens the collapse of the United States that's coming to what happened to the old Soviet Union.
[00:59:58.559 --> 01:00:01.961]  Remember though, this is all orchestrated and engineered and we have the documents.
[01:00:01.961 --> 01:00:06.784]  That's something that unfortunately Mr. Schiff and Mr. Means and others I don't think understand.
[01:00:06.784 --> 01:00:09.486]  But we'll talk more about that with Bob Chapman straight ahead.
[01:00:09.486 --> 01:00:11.167]  Here is Peter Schiff on Russia Today.
[01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:16.953]  We're buying trillions and trillions of dollars in government debt, and the dollar is just going to implode.
[01:00:16.953 --> 01:00:18.974]  Nobody is going to want it, not even Americans.
[01:00:18.974 --> 01:00:24.659]  When the dollar implodes, what does it mean for Americans living in this country consuming with the dollar?
[01:00:24.659 --> 01:00:26.460]  Well, they're not going to be consuming anymore.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.061]  I mean, because the dollar is not going to buy anything.
[01:00:28.061 --> 01:00:35.327]  Remember, the only reason we're able to buy stuff now is because foreigners will send us all the stuff they make in exchange for our dollars.
[01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:38.590]  When they don't want our dollars anymore, we're not going to get their stuff.
[01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:41.372]  And we don't have the factories to produce the stuff ourselves.
[01:00:42.212 --> 01:00:44.873]  And so we're going to have a bunch of money, but we're not going to buy anything.
[01:00:44.873 --> 01:00:46.034]  Are we talking bread lines?
[01:00:46.034 --> 01:00:59.459]  I mean... Well, if the government imposes price controls, which is something I think is coming, I think, under the Obama administration, inflation is going to get so bad that I believe the government is going to follow the misguided footsteps of Nixon.
[01:01:00.479 --> 01:01:05.662]  And impose price controls on various consumer goods, including food items, energy items.
[01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:09.163]  And if we do that, yes, there'll be long lines for everything.
[01:01:09.163 --> 01:01:11.424]  And people will start trading on the black market.
[01:01:11.424 --> 01:01:14.106]  If you want to buy something, you won't be able to buy it officially.
[01:01:14.106 --> 01:01:15.586]  You'll have to buy it in the black market.
[01:01:15.586 --> 01:01:17.387]  And what will the black market currency be?
[01:01:17.387 --> 01:01:18.748]  Will it be the Euro?
[01:01:18.748 --> 01:01:21.309]  Will it be silver coins?
[01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:25.851]  What will Americans be trading in illegally to try to procure the things that they need?
[01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:29.473]  Because we are on a collision course for massive inflation.
[01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:35.457]  So what do people do to prepare for, honestly, the doom and gloom that you're describing right now?
[01:01:59.773 --> 01:02:00.413]  The fact that the U.S.
[01:02:00.413 --> 01:02:04.934]  is in such a weak position right now because of the economy, do you think that this could have an effect on its
[01:02:23.399 --> 01:02:25.661]  Well, no doubt.
[01:02:25.661 --> 01:02:32.325]  I mean, America is going to lose its role as a dominant player in the global economy, whether it's economically, whether it's militarily.
[01:02:32.325 --> 01:02:44.695]  I mean, you know, I mean, at one point, the Soviet Union was this giant superpower, but ultimately it collapsed because it couldn't finance it anymore, because it never really had the economy.
[01:02:44.695 --> 01:02:46.396]  And once it could no longer
[01:02:47.648 --> 01:02:59.972]  I mean, the Soviet Union was reduced to practically nothing in just a short period of time, and people wouldn't even believe that it was possible.
[01:02:59.972 --> 01:03:09.594]  I think you have a similar situation where the United States, our entire military presence around the world, could come to a very abrupt end when we can no longer afford to support the empire.
[01:03:09.594 --> 01:03:16.136]  I mean, we only can afford to support it now because of the overvalued dollar and the fact that we're able to borrow so much money from the rest of the world.
[01:03:16.836 --> 01:03:17.136]  I think so.
[01:03:39.011 --> 01:03:40.271]  The President wants Obama away.
[01:04:09.056 --> 01:04:10.737]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:10.737 --> 01:04:15.480]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.441]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:18.441 --> 01:04:21.483]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:27.627]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:04:27.627 --> 01:04:33.210]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:35.251]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:39.213]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[01:04:39.213 --> 01:04:42.035]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[01:04:42.035 --> 01:04:51.180]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:55.682]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[01:04:55.922 --> 01:04:58.264]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[01:04:58.264 --> 01:05:02.707]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[01:05:02.707 --> 01:05:08.411]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[01:05:08.411 --> 01:05:11.653]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[01:05:11.653 --> 01:05:14.775]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:16.817]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[01:05:16.817 --> 01:05:20.881]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[01:05:20.881 --> 01:05:25.025]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[01:05:25.025 --> 01:05:32.572]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[01:05:32.572 --> 01:05:36.496]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[01:05:36.496 --> 01:05:39.379]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:39.719 --> 01:05:46.702]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:05:46.702 --> 01:05:49.983]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:06:13.896 --> 01:06:17.118]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:06:17.118 --> 01:06:22.761]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:22.761 --> 01:06:29.606]  If you've got a question for Bob Chapman, theinternationalforecaster.com,
[01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:37.772]  He has predicted almost every trend and development we've seen.
[01:06:37.772 --> 01:06:41.753]  Very accurate history, and that's the topic we bring you.
[01:06:41.753 --> 01:06:55.778]  People who've proven themselves, whereas the mainstream media, the federal government, the Federal Reserve has been lying to you for years saying everything's wonderful, we're sound, having a debt-based economy is good, go into debt deeper, the whole time they were setting up the public.
[01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:57.919]  And we have the IMF and World Bank documents on this.
[01:06:58.499 --> 01:07:00.720]  We have the Bilderberg sources on this.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.142]  Three years ago, they were planning to pop the subprime mortgage in the next year and a half, which they did.
[01:07:05.142 --> 01:07:08.784]  And then you can argue that it's gotten out of control for them.
[01:07:08.784 --> 01:07:15.488]  I don't know if I agree with that, but regardless, they are going to organize and control the response and out of the crisis.
[01:07:15.488 --> 01:07:17.709]  We see government expanding.
[01:07:17.709 --> 01:07:19.530]  We see a consolidation of power.
[01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:20.530]  Thank you.
[01:07:41.041 --> 01:07:48.764]  The Chief Strategist at the Bank of England come out and say within two to five years the dollar will be completely devalued and dumped.
[01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.605]  That's what you've been saying, two to five years.
[01:07:50.605 --> 01:07:53.626]  You say two to three.
[01:07:53.626 --> 01:07:55.887]  Others are coming out and saying similar things.
[01:07:55.887 --> 01:07:56.908]  We have one of the biggest
[01:07:57.668 --> 01:08:05.210]  Fund managers in the world coming out today and saying the entire economy is a Ponzi scheme.
[01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:06.591]  I want to get into that.
[01:08:06.591 --> 01:08:11.272]  And then we have UBS and the federal government going around shutting down people's Swiss bank accounts.
[01:08:11.272 --> 01:08:14.273]  But these are the small fry Swiss bank accounts.
[01:08:14.273 --> 01:08:15.674]  This is selectively being done.
[01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:18.614]  It's only 18 billion of these 19,000 accounts.
[01:08:18.614 --> 01:08:19.415]  Sounds like a lot.
[01:08:19.415 --> 01:08:19.895]  It's nothing.
[01:08:20.816 --> 01:08:25.486]  We know it's all really going to Dubai and Luxembourg, so that's all part of selective enforcement as well.
[01:08:25.486 --> 01:08:27.210]  I'm going to get your analysis on that.
[01:08:28.919 --> 01:08:34.662]  First off, we're suddenly seeing The Economist and all these other publications signal depression.
[01:08:34.662 --> 01:08:35.983]  I had Paul Craig Roberts on.
[01:08:35.983 --> 01:08:38.444]  He said, no way to avert the depression now.
[01:08:38.444 --> 01:08:45.228]  He said it will be a, he agreed with my term, as you have, hyper-stag inflation.
[01:08:45.228 --> 01:08:47.949]  He said the most devastating combination ever seen.
[01:08:47.949 --> 01:08:49.970]  Nothing like this has ever happened.
[01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:52.371]  Bob Chapman.
[01:08:52.371 --> 01:08:54.052]  Well, let's start off with Peter.
[01:08:56.237 --> 01:08:57.518]  He put it eloquently.
[01:08:57.518 --> 01:08:58.538]  I agree with him.
[01:08:58.538 --> 01:09:14.863]  There's only one thing I disagree with and he believes that by going into other markets and investing in those places that you can avoid some of or these problems in America and perhaps what Western Europe and others are going to experience.
[01:09:14.863 --> 01:09:22.385]  And what in fact the whole world is going to experience dreadful economic and financial experiences.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.802]  Nobody is going to be left unscathed.
[01:09:26.802 --> 01:09:33.565]  And to think that there'll be a decoupling, I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:09:33.565 --> 01:09:35.867]  And that's what Pete is talking about.
[01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:41.549]  I think the only true place to be for safety is gold and silver related assets.
[01:09:41.549 --> 01:09:52.195]  And if you are a wealthy person and you want to have 20 or 30 or 40 percent of your assets in another safe place or a relatively safe place,
[01:09:52.908 --> 01:09:55.592]  I have recommended Swiss Franc Treasuries.
[01:09:55.592 --> 01:10:01.320]  Other than that, I don't have anything to offer, other than the fact that's where I disagree with him.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.603]  But the rest of what he said is absolutely correct.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:14.903]  Well, I mean, when you go into a Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome-type crisis, you only want what you can physically hold.
[01:10:14.903 --> 01:10:22.685]  And all the main analysts are saying this crisis is a black hole that is sucking the world in, and whereas the globalists like to blame the U.S.
[01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:29.067]  for this, it's the globalists that did it, and they've run the same Ponzi schemes in every major nation.
[01:10:29.067 --> 01:10:32.568]  And what's happening now, I saw an article this morning from Europe
[01:10:33.254 --> 01:10:44.520]  And they were talking about clients of banks demanding gold coins and gold bars, etc.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:49.983]  They haven't seen that in Switzerland since probably the late 1980s.
[01:10:49.983 --> 01:10:53.285]  And generally, you know, and throughout Europe.
[01:10:53.285 --> 01:10:54.546]  Now let's explain.
[01:10:54.546 --> 01:11:00.349]  Swiss bank accounts and other safe havens are saying, we don't want your paper.
[01:11:00.349 --> 01:11:02.690]  Give us gold or we won't hold it.
[01:11:05.287 --> 01:11:09.268]  Well, they're not going that far, but... I've seen reports of that.
[01:11:09.268 --> 01:11:09.608]  Go ahead.
[01:11:09.608 --> 01:11:13.149]  Well, the clients are saying, we want gold.
[01:11:13.149 --> 01:11:14.389]  I mean, that's just the bottom line.
[01:11:14.389 --> 01:11:16.550]  It's as simple as that.
[01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:25.552]  I'm sure that there are many pro-gold Swiss bankers today, as 10 years ago there weren't, 20 years ago there weren't.
[01:11:25.552 --> 01:11:29.232]  There were in the late 70s, because I used to spend a lot of time over there.
[01:11:29.232 --> 01:11:31.493]  But, you know, things change.
[01:11:31.493 --> 01:11:31.993]  But anyway,
[01:11:32.838 --> 01:11:41.300]  As far as the accounts that you mentioned earlier, yes, that is kind of a shovel of sand into the ocean.
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.721]  There's a lot more accounts over there than that.
[01:11:43.721 --> 01:11:59.305]  But in October, what happened was that the Swiss banks did agree that any American who has opened an account in Switzerland from here on out would have to file a W-9 and they would file it for him.
[01:11:59.989 --> 01:12:03.765]  So that means for any new people it would be no secrecy.
[01:12:07.424 --> 01:12:10.367]  Why are they going after UBS?
[01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:13.889]  Why are they closing 19,000 accounts?
[01:12:13.889 --> 01:12:17.832]  I mean, we know that the OECD has been saying they don't want any tax havens.
[01:12:17.832 --> 01:12:28.701]  They want world taxation in every nation under this new global government run by the central banks, the elite banks, where every nation has on average an 80% tax rate.
[01:12:28.701 --> 01:12:30.623]  They say France is the model.
[01:12:30.623 --> 01:12:35.407]  They call the United States a tax haven, and now the United States has been empowering worldwide
[01:12:36.347 --> 01:12:42.088]  The OECD to go out and try to shut down these accounts, but we know it's selectively being done.
[01:12:42.088 --> 01:12:42.848]  Why?
[01:12:42.848 --> 01:12:44.749]  I mean, do they just want the money?
[01:12:44.749 --> 01:12:46.009]  Are they setting a precedent?
[01:12:46.009 --> 01:12:46.989]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:12:46.989 --> 01:12:51.370]  They want to control everybody's money.
[01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:57.291]  And they want to make sure they get every bit of tax that they're supposed to get so they can steal it.
[01:12:57.291 --> 01:12:59.951]  That's really the bottom line on this thing.
[01:12:59.951 --> 01:13:04.752]  And this has been underway for the last eight years under Bush here in the United States.
[01:13:05.273 --> 01:13:24.784]  I mean, I've talked to heads of government who have told me right straight to my face over dinner that they came in here, they told us you're going to do this, this, this, this, and this, and if you don't, we're going to cut off your internet, all your communications, all your banking connections.
[01:13:24.784 --> 01:13:27.326]  We're going to make it so miserable you'll have no tourism.
[01:13:28.093 --> 01:13:30.275]  Uh, you either agree or we'll destroy you.
[01:13:48.588 --> 01:13:54.050]  Sucking it into government, then it goes offshore to these globalist combines that are outside the law.
[01:13:54.050 --> 01:14:02.272]  Example, Goldman Sachs paid less than 1% in corporate taxes in 2008 and in 2007.
[01:14:02.272 --> 01:14:15.736]  So, they pay basically nothing, and then average citizens, let's say you try to own a car dealership, you try to own a restaurant, you try to own a real estate company, you try to own a clothier, anything, they're going to squeeze the daylights out of you.
[01:14:17.496 --> 01:14:18.756]  And that's why it got to be stopped.
[01:14:18.756 --> 01:14:20.457]  And if it's not stopped, America is going to be pauperized.
[01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:21.517]  And one of the things that
[01:14:45.894 --> 01:14:58.942]  Peter brought out and Paul Craig Roberts and I have brought out before is free trade and globalization which has led to the destruction of the manufacturing industries in the United States.
[01:14:58.942 --> 01:15:15.492]  One of the ways that we could stop this that's going on, not financially, and there's a reason I'm telling you all this, but for the American worker is simply to invoke, and I think it's coming,
[01:15:16.272 --> 01:15:20.354]  Invoke trade barriers.
[01:15:20.354 --> 01:15:22.934]  Things that we've had since the year 1800.
[01:15:22.934 --> 01:15:27.496]  Tariffs on goods and services.
[01:15:27.496 --> 01:15:29.377]  That would reverse this whole thing.
[01:15:29.377 --> 01:15:41.041]  Now I brought this up because all those transnational corporations are making money by manufacturing goods in China, selling them in America, and the profits go to the Cayman Islands.
[01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:43.822]  Now if you remember three years ago, what they did
[01:15:44.719 --> 01:15:45.379]  Was the U.S.
[01:15:45.379 --> 01:15:59.808]  Congress, which is bought and paid for, they passed a law which was supposed to insert money into companies in the United States so they could hire more people, increase employment.
[01:15:59.808 --> 01:16:06.953]  And that money was to come from these transnationals that had all this money offshore that had never been taxed.
[01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:10.315]  And instead of paying 33 percent, they paid five and a quarter.
[01:16:11.306 --> 01:16:16.189]  What a sweetheart deal on $360 billion.
[01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:19.711]  Now, we should have got 33% of that.
[01:16:19.711 --> 01:16:21.752]  We, the American government.
[01:16:21.752 --> 01:16:24.953]  And that bears out exactly what you're talking about.
[01:16:24.953 --> 01:16:26.474]  Two sets of rules.
[01:16:26.474 --> 01:16:27.735]  One for us and one for them.
[01:16:31.058 --> 01:16:34.639]  And they're going for broke by debasing all the nations of the world.
[01:16:34.639 --> 01:16:37.620]  They make us weak, bankrupt, easily controlled.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.142]  Meanwhile, they are internationalized.
[01:16:41.142 --> 01:16:45.503]  They aren't beholden to the same set of rules because they're the internationalists.
[01:16:45.503 --> 01:16:52.606]  They're the global government, openly, with the private central bank families, setting world law.
[01:16:52.606 --> 01:16:54.367]  I mean, this is the ultimate tyranny.
[01:16:54.367 --> 01:16:57.568]  This is like a science fiction nightmare.
[01:16:57.568 --> 01:17:00.469]  And that's why Alex is going to only be one answer.
[01:17:01.334 --> 01:17:03.515]  And it's going to be in the streets.
[01:17:03.515 --> 01:17:06.535]  Because these people are not going to give up.
[01:17:06.535 --> 01:17:10.437]  Every nation is going to have the same problem America's going to have.
[01:17:10.437 --> 01:17:13.918]  They're all going to be on the verge of revolution.
[01:17:13.918 --> 01:17:20.800]  That's why I don't think we'll ever see foreign troops brought in to quell anything in America.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:29.442]  I mean, let's say that Brazil was asked to send troops in to America to help put down insurrection.
[01:17:30.219 --> 01:17:35.022]  Well, the minute they do that, they're going to have insurrection of Brazil because there's no troops around.
[01:17:35.022 --> 01:17:36.403]  Well, look at Greece.
[01:17:36.403 --> 01:17:37.844]  Look at San Francisco.
[01:17:37.844 --> 01:17:39.725]  The cop cold-bloodedly kills the guy.
[01:17:39.725 --> 01:17:41.066]  They say the cop's going to go free.
[01:17:41.066 --> 01:17:42.987]  He did a good job killing him.
[01:17:42.987 --> 01:17:44.068]  And so the people riot.
[01:17:44.068 --> 01:17:45.909]  What do you expect them to do?
[01:17:45.909 --> 01:17:46.249]  That's right.
[01:17:46.249 --> 01:17:52.613]  Thank God they've still got some humanity in them, some anger.
[01:17:52.613 --> 01:17:53.974]  And the media decries it.
[01:17:53.974 --> 01:17:57.536]  They should just sit down and enjoy the fact this young man's dead.
[01:17:57.536 --> 01:17:59.097]  That officer did an excellent job.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.982]  That's sick.
[01:18:02.982 --> 01:18:05.564]  And then they lied about it and said there weren't any videotapes.
[01:18:05.564 --> 01:18:06.385]  It turned out there were.
[01:18:06.385 --> 01:18:11.168]  I mean, just unbelievable.
[01:18:11.168 --> 01:18:13.350]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman and your phone calls.
[01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:16.973]  Stay with us.
[01:18:16.973 --> 01:18:19.835]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:18:19.835 --> 01:18:21.396]  Loose change, final cut.
[01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:23.558]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:18:23.558 --> 01:18:25.179]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:18:25.421 --> 01:18:26.923]  The late, great USA.
[01:18:26.923 --> 01:18:28.685]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:19:16.163 --> 01:19:16.964]  Gold.
[01:19:16.964 --> 01:19:18.505]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:18.505 --> 01:19:24.769]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:19:24.769 --> 01:19:28.572]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:19:28.932 --> 01:19:30.873]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:19:30.873 --> 01:19:33.315]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:19:33.315 --> 01:19:41.399]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:19:41.399 --> 01:19:50.304]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[01:20:15.516 --> 01:20:21.360]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:26.784]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:20:26.784 --> 01:20:32.147]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:20:32.147 --> 01:20:35.730]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:20:36.010 --> 01:20:38.051]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[01:20:38.051 --> 01:20:44.273]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:48.075]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:20:48.075 --> 01:20:52.877]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:20:52.877 --> 01:20:53.937]  Do your part.
[01:20:53.937 --> 01:20:56.558]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[01:21:05.404 --> 01:21:07.205]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[01:21:22.321 --> 01:21:26.583]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[01:21:26.583 --> 01:21:31.986]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[01:21:31.986 --> 01:21:39.831]  GetSeeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with a complete range of crops.

[01:22:04.606 --> 01:22:05.647]  That's 877-394-6657 or go to GetSeeds.net.
[01:22:18.897 --> 01:22:30.683]  I want to start going to your calls right now, because listeners will bring up a lot of questions that I wouldn't have thought to ask, or points that Bob wouldn't have thought to make, but he has knowledge on.
[01:22:30.683 --> 01:22:44.730]  But briefly, Bob, dealing with the nature of the overlords that are carrying this out, they're not invincible, they're not God, they have a lot of systems of brainwashing and control and deception, but once people lose confidence in them,
[01:22:45.981 --> 01:22:49.703]  You know, they'll try to set up new dummy institutions to get confidence.
[01:22:49.703 --> 01:22:57.306]  That's what Obama is, but people are already seeing through that facade rather quickly, and we see that degrading fast.
[01:22:57.306 --> 01:23:07.211]  So I predict within six, eight months, you'll have a 50% approval rating, 40% approval rating instead of 60 plus right now, and then it'll plunge down to about 15% within a year and a half.
[01:23:07.211 --> 01:23:09.772]  Congress still has a 9% approval rating, but Bob,
[01:23:10.532 --> 01:23:21.758]  When you read the PNAC documents, or Brzezinski's The Great Chess Board, or Between Two Ages, you know, they say, we're the world empire, we've got to make this move, it's risky, but we've got to try to enslave everybody.
[01:23:21.758 --> 01:23:24.200]  They're very honest about it.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:29.863]  And so I guess it's the position of, we've got the power, we've got to use it, and so they're overreaching.
[01:23:29.863 --> 01:23:34.045]  I agree with you, I don't see this New World Order going too well.
[01:23:34.045 --> 01:23:37.787]  Yeah, I think they've made a lot of mistakes, particularly in the last ten years.
[01:23:38.371 --> 01:23:48.958]  And Brzezinski, three and a half, four years ago, said that, particularly in relation to the Bush administration, which has just been a disaster for them.
[01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:54.422]  And they passed a point of no return in June 2002.
[01:23:54.422 --> 01:23:57.764]  And I know that Paul Craig Roberts says there's no way back.
[01:23:57.764 --> 01:24:01.907]  Well, there's been no way back for a long time, about six years.
[01:24:01.907 --> 01:24:04.368]  And so they've got to go forward with this thing.
[01:24:04.368 --> 01:24:06.370]  And they're not going to come out unscathed.
[01:24:08.558 --> 01:24:19.421]  Kissinger, in his three minutes on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange a couple of days ago, telling us that Obama's going to usher in the New World Order.
[01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:30.864]  He's letting everybody on Wall Street and corporate America and banking and government know that the program's still on and we're in there and we're going to make it happen.
[01:24:30.864 --> 01:24:34.644]  And he's saying you better toe the line.
[01:24:34.644 --> 01:24:35.285]  That's right.
[01:24:35.285 --> 01:24:36.985]  It was essentially a threat.
[01:24:37.774 --> 01:24:43.038]  And I like threats, because it makes me more steadfast.
[01:24:43.038 --> 01:24:45.060]  And let's do what they want.
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.761]  We're going to beat them, Alex.
[01:24:46.761 --> 01:24:49.704]  It's going to be very painful, but we're going to beat them.
[01:24:49.704 --> 01:24:50.104]  I agree.
[01:24:50.104 --> 01:24:54.067]  Now we see Pat Robertson saying socialism will save us.
[01:24:54.067 --> 01:24:55.989]  He says other people will accept it.
[01:24:55.989 --> 01:24:58.291]  He says Obama is unstoppable.
[01:24:58.291 --> 01:24:59.431]  Just submit to him.
[01:24:59.431 --> 01:25:03.395]  He's been talking to God again.
[01:25:03.395 --> 01:25:05.096]  Why don't we ever have that opportunity?
[01:25:05.096 --> 01:25:06.097]  Why is it always him?
[01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:19.774]  Hey, Bob, why do we see all these top real estate brokers, bond brokers, and other... Adolf Merkel, one of the world's richest men, mysteriously dies, commits suicide.
[01:25:19.774 --> 01:25:24.095]  We're seeing a lot of these mid-level elitists dying.
[01:25:24.095 --> 01:25:27.376]  Well, I can't answer why, because I don't know.
[01:25:27.376 --> 01:25:30.337]  They said it was a suicide, but who knows?
[01:25:30.337 --> 01:25:34.618]  You know, I've seen suicides where people have shot themselves in the back.
[01:25:34.618 --> 01:25:37.579]  You know, they've got this thing, this system,
[01:25:38.172 --> 01:25:39.173]  So controlled.
[01:25:39.173 --> 01:25:42.638]  It's just like you pointed out earlier.
[01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:49.046]  The policeman shoots a man in the back and said he was defending himself and there were no cameras when in fact there were.
[01:25:49.046 --> 01:25:52.250]  And they're still not going to do anything.
[01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:53.352]  It's okay to murder people.
[01:25:54.414 --> 01:26:05.957]  Yeah, they confiscate people's cell phone cameras, and it turns out people on another train did get video of it, and now they're in a lot of trouble, but they're so arrogant, they say, yeah, a cop goes free, nothing we can do about it.
[01:26:05.957 --> 01:26:15.280]  Yeah, this guy threw himself... But that vein goes entirely through this upper echelon of, we can never be wrong.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.641]  We get two sets of rules, one for us, one for you.
[01:26:18.641 --> 01:26:20.401]  And that's the way it's going to be.
[01:26:20.401 --> 01:26:21.682]  Well, I get news for them.
[01:26:21.682 --> 01:26:23.122]  We're going to change it, Alex, aren't we?
[01:26:25.086 --> 01:26:26.227]  Well, we don't have any choice.
[01:26:26.227 --> 01:26:26.768]  We've got to.
[01:26:26.768 --> 01:26:32.093]  These people are giving us no quarter, but let's go ahead and go to a phone call for Bob Chapman.
[01:26:32.093 --> 01:26:33.274]  Don in Canada.
[01:26:33.274 --> 01:26:38.138]  You're on the air.
[01:26:38.138 --> 01:26:38.659]  Hey, Don.
[01:26:38.659 --> 01:26:39.480]  You want to be on air?
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.302]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:26:42.302 --> 01:26:42.843]  You want to be on air?
[01:26:42.843 --> 01:26:44.024]  Go ahead.
[01:26:44.024 --> 01:26:44.384]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:44.384 --> 01:26:46.186]  I just wanted to ask a couple of questions.
[01:26:46.186 --> 01:26:47.968]  One was Marvin Bush.
[01:26:49.352 --> 01:26:56.200]  I'm sort of surprised there's no Marvin Bush footage.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:03.409]  I was just wondering, is the Truthers, like, this is a call out to the Truthers to get footage of Marvin Bush.
[01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:19.890]  Well, I mean, we confront who we can confront in cities all across the nation, and Marvin Bush doesn't come out from under his rock much, but yes, in two of my 9-11 films, we do talk about how he was running security in the World Trade Centers, and then the debunkers say that's not true.
[01:27:19.890 --> 01:27:24.733]  It's in mainstream news articles, and his mother wrote about it in her memoir three years ago.
[01:27:24.733 --> 01:27:26.554]  That's how we know about it.
[01:27:26.554 --> 01:27:29.976]  Yeah, but I just want to say something to the truth.
[01:27:29.976 --> 01:27:32.457]  They're doing a great job, and keep it up.
[01:27:33.061 --> 01:27:41.991]  And one last question is about Arnold Schwarzenegger wearing the Nazi deathbed belt buckle in the magazine with Bloomberg.
[01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:48.558]  Actually, probably a year ago I saw him with Bloomberg on another cover wearing the same belt buckle.
[01:27:50.683 --> 01:27:54.365]  You know, I'm just shocked that no one's ever asked him a question about that.
[01:27:54.365 --> 01:27:58.686]  Because, again, there's rules for us and then rules for them.
[01:27:58.686 --> 01:28:00.007]  He can say he loves Hitler.
[01:28:00.007 --> 01:28:01.968]  He can say he wants to be a dictator.
[01:28:01.968 --> 01:28:02.728]  That's good.
[01:28:02.728 --> 01:28:07.150]  If you say he's a Nazi, the ADL calls you a Nazi.
[01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:08.551]  We're on the march.
[01:28:08.551 --> 01:28:11.072]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:11.072 --> 01:28:13.773]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:17.219 --> 01:28:23.984]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:28:23.984 --> 01:28:26.606]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:28:26.606 --> 01:28:28.167]  But who is the enemy?
[01:28:28.167 --> 01:28:28.968]  Bin Laden.
[01:28:28.968 --> 01:28:29.989]  This is his M.O.
[01:28:29.989 --> 01:28:31.350]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:33.331]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:28:33.331 --> 01:28:40.477]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:28:40.477 --> 01:28:40.957]  Some U.S.
[01:28:40.957 --> 01:28:46.602]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:28:47.302 --> 01:28:50.804]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:28:50.804 --> 01:28:52.945]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:29:17.691 --> 01:29:20.353]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[01:29:20.353 --> 01:29:25.396]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with the reflective spray.
[01:29:25.396 --> 01:29:27.337]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[01:29:27.337 --> 01:29:28.678]  We are under the microscope.
[01:29:28.678 --> 01:29:32.681]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.

[01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:39.315]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:30:39.315 --> 01:30:44.339]  HHO, also called browns gas, burns efficiently and provides the energy your car needs.
[01:30:44.339 --> 01:30:47.701]  In just 10 minutes, you'll discover exactly how this is possible.
[01:30:47.701 --> 01:30:50.263]  This is the secret the oil companies don't want you to know.
[01:30:50.263 --> 01:30:50.964]  Learn how easy it
[01:30:55.776 --> 01:30:56.056]  I think so.
[01:31:56.419 --> 01:31:57.539]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[01:31:57.539 --> 01:32:00.941]  We're continuing with your phone calls.
[01:32:00.941 --> 01:32:02.101]  Sean in New York.
[01:32:02.101 --> 01:32:03.282]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:32:03.282 --> 01:32:03.662]  Go ahead.
[01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:06.271]  How you doing, Bob?
[01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:27.167]  Um, but I wanted to ask Bob, pretty much, is it even worth paying, um, I know it's pretty stupid, but I mean, just asking, since the money's pretty much going to amount to nothing, is it pretty much even worth paying, like, most of these bills and credit card debts and all these sort of things that the American people are going to be having to deal with?
[01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:30.230]  I mean, if the money's pretty much going to be worth nothing at all?
[01:32:31.894 --> 01:32:38.198]  Well, you've got to understand that the people that you owe the money to are still going to be within the system.
[01:32:38.198 --> 01:32:41.180]  There is going to be some kind of a system.
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:45.283]  Maybe it'll break down from time to time, but you're still going to have to pay it off.
[01:32:45.283 --> 01:32:53.948]  And just because the value of the dollar goes down, it still means that you have to pay those bills.
[01:32:53.948 --> 01:32:59.112]  The way you protect yourself is to call MIDAS and purchase gold and silver coins.
[01:33:01.089 --> 01:33:03.371]  Well, sir, let me break down the basics of this.
[01:33:03.371 --> 01:33:07.095]  It's a very sophisticated, nuanced question.
[01:33:07.095 --> 01:33:09.017]  Here's the deal, and they've announced this.
[01:33:09.017 --> 01:33:16.844]  England is actually bringing back debtor prisons, where they're going to put you in jail if you haven't paid debts, where they're going to allow
[01:33:18.412 --> 01:33:19.053]  Thank you.
[01:33:35.706 --> 01:33:35.786]  Yes.
[01:33:53.962 --> 01:33:55.824]  Do you have bad credit?
[01:33:55.824 --> 01:33:59.528]  Have you ever not paid a credit card off?
[01:33:59.528 --> 01:34:03.913]  And they say, sorry, we're not accepting even your debit card or even your check.
[01:34:03.913 --> 01:34:05.875]  And then they're talking about not even your cash.
[01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:08.578]  So talk about the beast system.
[01:34:08.578 --> 01:34:10.940]  They are saying that you won't be able to buy or sell
[01:34:12.081 --> 01:34:14.844]  Uh, in these major mega-marts which are taking over.
[01:34:14.844 --> 01:34:20.089]  They're actually getting more profitable during the crisis as Main Street dies even further.
[01:34:20.089 --> 01:34:25.774]  And now all over the nation they're raiding watermelon stands, uh, uh, uh, egg stands.
[01:34:25.774 --> 01:34:30.439]  They're raiding people that slaughter their own, uh, lamb and sell it at a local co-op.
[01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:45.896]  They are massively increasing bureaucracies to shut down the family farm, animal ID, premises ID, and so as they squeeze you, they're then going to make it very hard for you to be in the underground black market or free economy.
[01:34:46.457 --> 01:34:59.463]  And they're going to force you into a national ID card where there's no economy left, and they dump credits onto your card that you can barely live on, but then you have to quote be part of the National Compulsory Service Brigades.
[01:34:59.463 --> 01:35:03.745]  They're going to have eight separate groups, they've announced, at change.gov.
[01:35:05.646 --> 01:35:09.388]  Again, yeah, the banks, they don't have to pay their bills, but you do.
[01:35:09.388 --> 01:35:15.330]  Now, at a certain point, if it comes down to feeding your families, yeah, don't pay the bills anymore, but that's a moral decision you have to pay.
[01:35:15.330 --> 01:35:17.832]  Don't screw the guy that fixes your car on credit.
[01:35:17.832 --> 01:35:18.852]  That's immoral.
[01:35:18.852 --> 01:35:23.994]  But if it isn't paying a credit card to a private bank that created out of fiat, I see nothing immoral about that.
[01:35:23.994 --> 01:35:29.177]  You just have to understand the consequences of how they're going to use this cashless grid to squeeze you.
[01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:30.177]  Absolutely.
[01:35:30.177 --> 01:35:30.897]  I couldn't say it any better.
[01:35:30.897 --> 01:35:31.138]  Perfect.
[01:35:31.138 --> 01:35:33.239]  And one more thing, Alex, I just wanted to ask you.
[01:35:33.239 --> 01:35:36.240]  I know you keep putting out statistics of people really waking up and
[01:35:58.539 --> 01:36:05.047]  I really believe it, but then there's still a lot of time that I can talk to old people and even people my age.
[01:36:05.047 --> 01:36:06.609]  I'm only 24.
[01:36:06.609 --> 01:36:12.377]  And I can just still ask them questions and there still seems to be this Obama daze of just
[01:36:13.021 --> 01:36:17.565]  Not nowhere near understanding half of what's even going on, or what's about to come.
[01:36:36.049 --> 01:36:36.610]  I don't know.
[01:36:57.995 --> 01:36:59.916]  Well, here's some good news.
[01:36:59.916 --> 01:37:00.816]  Here's some good news.
[01:37:00.816 --> 01:37:03.838]  I went to the mall, because the lady that cuts my hair is in the mall.
[01:37:03.838 --> 01:37:05.038]  I don't normally go to the mall.
[01:37:05.038 --> 01:37:06.759]  I don't really like that culture.
[01:37:06.759 --> 01:37:18.826]  But I'm in there, and I had three separate black guys, two of them working at Little Kiosk, stop me and go, you know, I always liked you for years, but kind of got upset at first when you didn't like Obama, but I want to basically apologize.
[01:37:18.826 --> 01:37:20.447]  You were right about Obama.
[01:37:21.447 --> 01:37:23.489]  Uh, and I, you know, I can see his betrayal.
[01:37:23.489 --> 01:37:25.351]  So give him some time.
[01:37:25.351 --> 01:37:30.255]  The people who won't wake up is, is, is white yuppies because they're just so arrogant.
[01:37:30.255 --> 01:37:36.080]  They're so trusting in the system that, uh, Bob Chapman, you want to comment on that?
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:39.443]  No, no, it's perfect.
[01:37:39.443 --> 01:37:42.046]  It reflects exactly what's going on.
[01:37:42.046 --> 01:37:44.127]  And he's just a front man.
[01:37:44.127 --> 01:37:47.891]  And, uh, we, you know, we have team B went in for team A.
[01:37:48.689 --> 01:37:52.493]  And they're all Illuminati, they're all CFR, etc.
[01:37:52.493 --> 01:37:55.337]  And they're going to keep on doing exactly what they were doing before.
[01:37:56.581 --> 01:37:59.383]  Yeah, I mean, I say this a lot, but I want listeners to understand something.
[01:37:59.383 --> 01:38:00.224]  This isn't a game.
[01:38:00.224 --> 01:38:01.084]  This is life and death.
[01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:02.205]  I get death threats.
[01:38:02.205 --> 01:38:02.905]  Bob gets them.
[01:38:02.905 --> 01:38:04.506]  Bob's had to leave the country.
[01:38:04.506 --> 01:38:06.067]  Okay?
[01:38:06.067 --> 01:38:07.188]  I mean, this is the real world.
[01:38:07.188 --> 01:38:10.871]  We have people attacking us last night that I'm not even going to get into on air.
[01:38:10.871 --> 01:38:12.492]  I mean, it's off the charts.
[01:38:12.492 --> 01:38:13.733]  But again, that's a blessing.
[01:38:13.733 --> 01:38:15.174]  We know we're having an effect.
[01:38:15.174 --> 01:38:23.800]  But for those that are doubting if any of this is, you know, isn't real or we're exaggerating, we're holding back the severity, Bob.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:24.140]  You're right.
[01:38:25.612 --> 01:38:27.654]  Absolutely right.
[01:38:27.654 --> 01:38:28.675]  Anything else?
[01:38:28.675 --> 01:38:29.836]  You know, I'll tell you something.
[01:38:29.836 --> 01:38:33.098]  We are hurting them very, very badly.
[01:38:33.098 --> 01:38:40.264]  And by going to the sponsors of these kinds of programs and helping them keeps us on the air.
[01:38:40.264 --> 01:38:42.326]  Absolutely.
[01:38:42.326 --> 01:38:44.568]  There's others like us as well.
[01:38:44.568 --> 01:38:46.209]  We've got to get the word out.
[01:38:46.209 --> 01:38:53.355]  And as Alex just said, people are coming up to him and saying, gee, you know, at the first I didn't believe you and now I do.
[01:38:53.997 --> 01:39:02.219]  And I'm glad you said what you said, and you're truthful, and people desperately need the truth.
[01:39:02.219 --> 01:39:02.839]  Absolutely.
[01:39:02.839 --> 01:39:04.999]  You were trying to say something else, Sean?
[01:39:04.999 --> 01:39:18.122]  Yeah, I was just going to say, you know, that's why I just really want to thank you and Bob, you know, especially, and for you guys to know that myself and I'm pretty sure that there's millions of others that actually live, like, day-to-day life off of you guys' information.
[01:39:18.889 --> 01:39:29.051]  And, you know, I just appreciate you guys coming on every single day because we tune in every day to learn what steps we can do, advanced steps, to probably fight this thing.
[01:39:29.051 --> 01:39:33.292]  And you guys' information, it's vital to us.
[01:39:33.292 --> 01:39:36.213]  Sean, God bless you and I appreciate that and that's how we keep going on.
[01:39:36.213 --> 01:39:41.394]  I want to be clear though, because this is a reflex, this is an instinct you need to have.
[01:39:42.486 --> 01:39:43.627]  I'm not lying to you.
[01:39:43.627 --> 01:39:45.148]  Everything I tell you is documented.
[01:39:45.148 --> 01:39:52.134]  I had a guest on yesterday and he said they haven't announced yet that a world government run by banks will control us.
[01:39:52.134 --> 01:39:56.979]  And I said, yes they have, and I pulled up Newsweek and a few other articles and put it on screen.
[01:39:56.979 --> 01:40:02.043]  So everything I cover is... Bob, this is what I just had a huge flashback.
[01:40:04.292 --> 01:40:21.152]  I learned that there's a bill introduced, the Democrats have a good chance of passing, to where the Attorney General is given carte blanche, letter of mark, to ban any guns he wants, and this is the former Clinton Deputy Attorney General, and they are already saying that they will ban most rifles and handguns.
[01:40:21.152 --> 01:40:23.574]  Now, I have the bill number, I've read the bill,
[01:40:24.275 --> 01:40:35.399]  And I'm so busy covering everything else and I'm so subconsciously acclimated to the belief that I really know they're coming after our guns that then I don't even ring the alarm bell because I've been so deep in this fight.
[01:40:35.399 --> 01:40:38.500]  Can you speak to that psychological danger we have that
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:49.607]  Or do you ever get into that where you get so acclimated to these horrors that it becomes second nature and you even lose your capacity to become upset by it?
[01:40:49.607 --> 01:40:52.489]  You almost become accustomed to this devilishness?
[01:40:52.489 --> 01:40:55.852]  Because I have the bill right here and I haven't even given the bill number out in two days.
[01:40:55.852 --> 01:40:58.734]  I keep forgetting to get to it.
[01:40:58.734 --> 01:41:00.635]  Well, I think you better give it out right now.
[01:41:00.635 --> 01:41:01.435]  Do you have it?
[01:41:01.435 --> 01:41:02.496]  Yeah, I'm going to pull it up in a minute.
[01:41:02.496 --> 01:41:03.857]  I had it up on screen and that's my problem.
[01:41:03.857 --> 01:41:06.299]  Well, I want to say this to answer your question.
[01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:21.003]  You know, after these many years I've been involved in this, the sensitivity is still there to what's going on, but what you have to do, and I call it compartmentalization in your brain.
[01:41:21.003 --> 01:41:36.513]  You have your field of knowledge, and then you have what the bad guys are doing, and then you have the new events that are coming along, and you have to first discern what part of the new events that are coming along
[01:41:36.894 --> 01:41:37.474]  We're good to go.
[01:42:05.623 --> 01:42:08.865]  It's the same with myself.
[01:42:08.865 --> 01:42:13.347]  You and I, at least, haven't been desensitized.
[01:42:13.347 --> 01:42:18.190]  It's hard to handle it, but we've got to do it for them.
[01:42:18.190 --> 01:42:19.971]  All those people out there.
[01:42:19.971 --> 01:42:21.652]  Because they can't handle it, but we can.
[01:42:23.476 --> 01:42:25.717]  Well, I mean it's more nuanced.
[01:42:25.717 --> 01:42:27.418]  I guess I'm not articulating it right.
[01:42:27.418 --> 01:42:45.347]  I'm more sensitive than ever, but it's like I'm a batter up with a thousand baseballs coming at me, and just incredible things come on the scene now that would have shaken the whole situation ten years ago, and now there's so many mega bad things happening that it makes my head spin.
[01:42:45.347 --> 01:42:46.928]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:42:46.928 --> 01:42:49.289]  Yeah, and that is the truth.
[01:42:49.289 --> 01:42:50.810]  I mean, I say to my wife,
[01:42:51.249 --> 01:42:59.456]  Should we rename the International Forecaster to the International Financial and Economic, Political and Social Inquirer?
[01:42:59.456 --> 01:43:05.221]  I mean, there is no good news out there that I can find.
[01:43:05.221 --> 01:43:08.444]  I'm looking for the article right now.
[01:43:08.444 --> 01:43:10.666]  It's just... Here it is.
[01:43:10.666 --> 01:43:15.370]  Proposed law would allow Obama AG holder to ban guns at will.
[01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:17.092]  Now, when I saw this in World Net Daily,
[01:43:18.769 --> 01:43:22.693]  I believed it because they're a pretty good source on things like that, but I wanted to go read the bill.
[01:43:22.693 --> 01:43:29.038]  So this was Monday night, now, I can't believe, no, Tuesday night, I can't believe it's all these days I haven't gotten to it.
[01:43:30.322 --> 01:43:36.228]  And his proposed law, you know in a way it's so horrific, I think in a way I psychologically suppress it.
[01:43:36.228 --> 01:43:38.670]  You know, people think I want to get up here and bash cops.
[01:43:38.670 --> 01:43:41.893]  90% of the time I don't even cover the articles I have because it makes me sick.
[01:43:41.893 --> 01:43:45.136]  You know, it's not like we're here even trying to give people all the bad news.
[01:43:45.136 --> 01:43:53.484]  Bob, do you ever kind of just cringe as all the info's coming in because you don't even want to have to analyze it because you're sick of it?
[01:43:53.484 --> 01:43:54.425]  You better believe it.
[01:43:55.717 --> 01:43:56.698]  You better believe it.
[01:43:56.698 --> 01:44:01.503]  And you know, it just gets nastier and nastier.
[01:44:01.503 --> 01:44:06.429]  Especially when I see people like Kissinger on television on CNBC.
[01:44:07.376 --> 01:44:09.478]  And Brzezinski and people like that.
[01:44:09.478 --> 01:44:11.740]  They're so, so evil.
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:12.720]  And relishing!
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.663]  He's saying this crisis is wonderful.
[01:44:15.663 --> 01:44:17.564]  The economic, the military.
[01:44:17.564 --> 01:44:18.905]  He was getting happy.
[01:44:18.905 --> 01:44:20.146]  His eyes twinkled.
[01:44:20.146 --> 01:44:21.587]  He said, this is going to help us.
[01:44:21.587 --> 01:44:22.708]  This is good.
[01:44:22.708 --> 01:44:24.269]  This is going to bring in a new world order.
[01:44:24.269 --> 01:44:25.911]  What a sick bastard.
[01:44:25.911 --> 01:44:29.474]  While those children in Gaza are dead everywhere.
[01:44:29.474 --> 01:44:30.494]  That's right.
[01:44:30.494 --> 01:44:32.756]  And they don't care how many people die.
[01:44:32.756 --> 01:44:33.597]  They're above that.
[01:44:35.831 --> 01:44:37.032]  Here it is.
[01:44:37.032 --> 01:44:41.674]  Nemo did a detailed story on it, but he sources World Net Daily and AP here.
[01:44:41.674 --> 01:44:45.675]  Proposed law may allow Obama AG to ban guns at will.
[01:44:45.675 --> 01:44:46.896]  Now, this is the same thing.
[01:44:46.896 --> 01:44:55.680]  Congress cedes unlimited, no oversight, complete power to the private Federal Reserve and the Treasury, separate and above government.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.802]  Greenspan goes on air and brags, we're above you all, no one can even investigate us.
[01:44:59.802 --> 01:45:00.902]  It's the same thing here.
[01:45:00.902 --> 01:45:04.864]  It's like ceding imperial, god-like, right-of-king power
[01:45:06.225 --> 01:45:11.027]  It says, uh, it looks like the gun grabbers may have a field day when the new Congress convenes.
[01:45:11.027 --> 01:45:20.113]  According to Bob Unruh, writing for WorldNetDaily, Obama's AG nominee, Eric Holder, is a big gun grabber, I would add, may have the ability to ban guns at will.
[01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:26.357]  They cite HR1022, sponsored by New York Democrat Carolyn McCarthy and 67 co-sponsors.
[01:45:28.118 --> 01:45:34.968]  And it goes on to say that when the new Democrats are seated in the new House, which I guess has just now happened, they have a good chance of passing it.
[01:45:34.968 --> 01:45:40.776]  And then we have the bill sections here where it just says, at will, he can ban any firearms he wants.
[01:45:40.776 --> 01:45:43.660]  So no longer is there laws, it's just a blank check.
[01:45:44.341 --> 01:45:45.562]  They just don't get it.
[01:45:45.562 --> 01:45:47.423]  And it's part of the brainwashing process.
[01:45:47.423 --> 01:45:48.664]  Half of them are out to lunch.
[01:46:12.463 --> 01:46:23.972]  And whether we'll get them back or not, I don't know, but we will get them once they're in the street, when their house is gone and the cars are gone and the debit card has no credits in it anymore.
[01:46:23.972 --> 01:46:27.054]  That's unfortunately when they're going to wake up.
[01:46:27.054 --> 01:46:32.219]  And if they pass this legislation, you better bury your weapons and your ammunition.
[01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:34.881]  Because if you turn it in, you're duck soup.
[01:46:35.976 --> 01:46:39.598]  And I apologize for using a little bit of that French, but I mean, that just came out of me.
[01:46:39.598 --> 01:46:43.220]  I mean, this is, they're getting ready to take your guns.
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:44.921]  This is America!
[01:46:44.921 --> 01:46:52.005]  And then the FBI's got all these manuals, Bob, saying we're terrorists because we believe there's a new world order and they want our guns.
[01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:59.170]  And then now they're all over the news saying world government, World Newsweek, world government run by a private bank.
[01:46:59.930 --> 01:47:03.253]  And then still the FBI says, no, you're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[01:47:03.253 --> 01:47:04.694]  I mean, how dare them?
[01:47:04.694 --> 01:47:09.237]  They openly work for a bankrupt criminal system!
[01:47:09.237 --> 01:47:11.478]  Absolutely.
[01:47:11.478 --> 01:47:20.345]  I mean, how does that double think work, Bob, to separately say none of this world government exists while they openly announce it?
[01:47:20.345 --> 01:47:22.006]  Again, they do what they want.
[01:47:22.006 --> 01:47:24.888]  They do it the way that they want.
[01:47:24.888 --> 01:47:29.371]  And, you know, there's nobody to stop them except your program and programs like it.
[01:47:30.865 --> 01:47:31.545]  I want to ask the FBI.
[01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:34.807]  I mean, this is the last hope.
[01:47:34.807 --> 01:47:38.029]  I mean, I want to ask the FBI and people that are involved in all this.
[01:47:38.029 --> 01:47:40.351]  I mean, do you like being the guys that are coming for our guns?
[01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:43.313]  Do you like being the guys that support the Madoffs that are looting the country?
[01:47:43.313 --> 01:47:48.276]  Do you like being the guys that work for the people that run the child-kidnapping rings that are in mainstream news?
[01:47:48.276 --> 01:47:52.138]  I mean, do you really like, or do you deny and say, oh no, it's not criminal?
[01:47:52.138 --> 01:47:53.539]  No, you know it's criminal!
[01:47:53.539 --> 01:47:55.640]  It's bankrupt from pillar to post!
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:57.882]  And you say, well, I'm not involved in that directly.
[01:47:57.882 --> 01:47:59.203]  Yeah, but your silence
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:03.803]  And being part of the system, you are guilty.
[01:48:03.803 --> 01:48:06.645]  You are accessories, Bob Chapman.
[01:48:06.645 --> 01:48:10.088]  Well, I agree with that completely, because they know what's going on.
[01:48:10.088 --> 01:48:13.470]  And it's situation ethics, if you may.
[01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:15.552]  And they justify it by the paycheck.
[01:48:15.552 --> 01:48:18.254]  And you get the same thing with law enforcement.
[01:48:18.254 --> 01:48:26.940]  And they better wake up, because they come after us, and they ain't gonna go home.
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:27.100]  Well...
[01:48:30.612 --> 01:48:33.094]  Who could imagine they'd actually get away with this?
[01:48:33.094 --> 01:48:35.236]  I mean, they're coming for the guns now.
[01:48:35.236 --> 01:48:53.454]  They've introduced a bill where they can ban whatever they want, whenever they want, a blank check, and the Federal Reserve Governor is in Bloomberg saying that even the regional Fed isn't involved in decisions, that a group above Treasury and the Fed New York has implemented war powers.
[01:48:54.963 --> 01:48:55.703]  War powers!
[01:48:55.703 --> 01:48:57.585]  Folks, that's martial law.
[01:48:57.585 --> 01:49:02.007]  That's a hoity-toity name for martial law.
[01:49:02.007 --> 01:49:04.288]  Over the Congress, over the system.
[01:49:04.288 --> 01:49:05.249]  Bob Chapman, stay there.
[01:49:05.249 --> 01:49:06.450]  We'll come back, take more phone calls.
[01:49:06.450 --> 01:49:09.311]  I'm going to keep you five minutes into the next hour on this Friday edition.
[01:49:09.311 --> 01:49:11.813]  Then we'll go live with Alan Watt from Canada.
[01:49:11.813 --> 01:49:17.396]  Stay with us.
[01:49:17.396 --> 01:49:24.380]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[01:49:25.162 --> 01:49:26.424]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:49:26.424 --> 01:49:33.473]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:49:33.473 --> 01:49:41.985]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:49:42.352 --> 01:49:49.453]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:49:49.453 --> 01:49:52.634]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:49:52.634 --> 01:49:58.395]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:49:58.395 --> 01:50:01.476]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:50:01.476 --> 01:50:08.677]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[01:50:11.288 --> 01:50:12.851]  The government sponsored terror.
[01:50:12.851 --> 01:50:15.335]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:50:17.313 --> 01:50:25.398]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?

[01:50:35.245 --> 01:50:38.787]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.

[01:50:43.610 --> 01:50:44.871]  The Paclite is so durable,
[01:50:45.131 --> 01:50:49.976]  Soldiers overseas rely on them and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:54.640]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.

[01:52:18.806 --> 01:52:26.890]  Well, the unions are big businessmen and they're going after that dinosaur.
[01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:29.651]  Well, they used to grow food in Kansas.
[01:52:45.163 --> 01:52:47.344]  All right, we are back live with Bob Chapman.
[01:52:47.344 --> 01:53:07.755]  I'm going to come back in the next little segment, take a few more calls, but right now, briefly, I wanted Bob and Ted Anderson to have a chance to talk, because I know the Minus Resources also offers a trial copy of the International Forecaster, but Ted is doing, Gold is up again today, but Ted bought it a few weeks ago at the $7.60 level, so he's, again, the price is
[01:53:08.735 --> 01:53:14.959]  Close to, I guess, $90 under what it is right now, so he factors that into the savings.
[01:53:14.959 --> 01:53:20.782]  Ted, tell folks out there about today and throughout the weekend the gold offer, and then I don't know what Bob's going to say.
[01:53:20.782 --> 01:53:25.585]  I want to see what he's going to say, because he's a great analyst on this, of how good a deal he thinks it is.
[01:53:25.585 --> 01:53:27.746]  So, Bob Chapman and Ted Anderson, you guys talk.
[01:53:28.666 --> 01:53:36.452]  Yeah, well, basically what I have right now, Alex, I mean, gold did edge up again today and seen a peak of 868.90, which means it is getting stronger.
[01:53:36.452 --> 01:53:41.475]  The unemployment figures came out way low, I mean, way higher than what it was.
[01:53:41.475 --> 01:53:45.538]  So, I mean, it's just the whole economy here is melting down.
[01:53:45.538 --> 01:53:55.145]  What I did is I picked up some francs here just a short while ago at that price level that you're referring to, and they're currently at 204, where the British Sovereign is at 252.
[01:53:56.716 --> 01:53:57.056]  I think?
[01:54:18.217 --> 01:54:19.717]  Just, you know, the whole thing.
[01:54:19.717 --> 01:54:24.138]  I mean, that gun issue that you're talking about earlier on should make people's blood boil.
[01:54:24.138 --> 01:54:34.820]  But I mean, it's all tied together, this whole New World Order thing, this Democrat vs. Republican, right vs. left, and you're talking about how it's this team or that team that has to win.
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:39.861]  I mean, it's like in a football game here in Minnesota, it's the Vikings vs. the Green Bay Packers.
[01:54:39.861 --> 01:54:40.602]  It doesn't matter.
[01:54:40.602 --> 01:54:42.882]  It's still the football game that's being played.
[01:54:42.882 --> 01:54:45.103]  And that's exactly what's going on here economically.
[01:54:45.103 --> 01:54:47.043]  Well, let me break this down and get Bob's take on this.
[01:54:48.208 --> 01:54:56.291]  Look, we've got the head strategist of the Bank of England saying the dollar within two to five years will be gone, maybe even faster.
[01:54:56.291 --> 01:55:01.172]  All these other world leaders are now saying it, I guess trying to signal that.
[01:55:01.172 --> 01:55:04.614]  There may come a time when you can't buy gold and silver with Federal Reserve notes.
[01:55:04.614 --> 01:55:07.134]  Folks, you need to move into gold and silver right now.
[01:55:07.134 --> 01:55:10.455]  Bob, A, is this a good deal, Ted's offering?
[01:55:10.455 --> 01:55:14.597]  B, why is gold and silver important to hold?
[01:55:16.294 --> 01:55:21.638]  Well, first of all, gold and silver is important to hold because it's the ultimate money.
[01:55:21.638 --> 01:55:30.566]  And when you have a devaluation, the value of what you own in gold and silver is going to go up in value versus the paper currency.
[01:55:30.566 --> 01:55:34.289]  As far as the francs are concerned, they're an excellent buy.
[01:55:34.289 --> 01:55:35.930]  Excellent.
[01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:39.253]  In fact, it's an extraordinary buy.
[01:55:39.253 --> 01:55:43.196]  But the point is, even after the francs are gone, they're sold out.
[01:55:44.042 --> 01:55:46.164]  You've got to continue to keep on buying.
[01:55:46.164 --> 01:55:49.447]  It's the only safe place for you to be.
[01:55:49.447 --> 01:55:50.548]  By the way, that's the next point.
[01:55:50.548 --> 01:55:52.810]  You know, Ted's been doing this 30 years.
[01:55:52.810 --> 01:55:54.251]  You've been doing it even longer than that.
[01:55:54.251 --> 01:55:59.576]  But, you know, as a broker, just analyzing it, not on the hard sales side.
[01:55:59.576 --> 01:56:05.201]  Ted, even though most of his competition can't even find Franks and things, they're now sending him.
[01:56:05.201 --> 01:56:09.265]  Most of them are uncirculated, meaning they're getting down to their last stores, Bob.
[01:56:11.363 --> 01:56:24.870]  Well, that is not surprising with the reports I hear coming in from all over the world that it's extraordinarily difficult to get gold and silver, and particularly in coins.
[01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:27.091]  I mean, you know, this is everywhere.
[01:56:27.091 --> 01:56:28.172]  Let me fire the number out.
[01:56:28.172 --> 01:56:28.412]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:28.412 --> 01:56:28.752]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:28.752 --> 01:56:36.476]  And there'll be brokers there until midnight Friday.
[01:56:36.476 --> 01:56:37.977]  And Ted, does this deal go through the weekend?
[01:56:37.977 --> 01:56:39.378]  Yeah, we'll hold it right through the weekend.
[01:56:39.938 --> 01:56:40.558]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:40.558 --> 01:56:51.601]  Folks, we're going to start the next hour, and I want Ted to be able to finish up his one-minute comment, then I'll take one or two final calls for Bob Chapman.
[01:56:51.601 --> 01:56:52.421]  But again, that number, 800-686-2237.
[01:56:52.421 --> 01:56:54.582]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:56:54.582 --> 01:56:59.943]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:07.065 --> 01:57:13.809]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:57:13.809 --> 01:57:16.451]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:57:16.451 --> 01:57:18.012]  But who is the enemy?
[01:57:18.012 --> 01:57:18.812]  Bin Laden.
[01:57:18.812 --> 01:57:19.813]  This is his ammo.
[01:57:19.813 --> 01:57:21.134]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:57:21.134 --> 01:57:23.175]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:57:23.175 --> 01:57:30.319]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:57:30.319 --> 01:57:30.799]  Some U.S.
[01:57:30.799 --> 01:57:36.443]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:57:37.143 --> 01:57:40.645]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:57:40.645 --> 01:57:43.446]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:58:09.597 --> 01:58:11.979]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:58:11.979 --> 01:58:21.328]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:21.328 --> 01:58:22.629]  Big Brother.
[01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:24.390]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:26.152]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:26.152 --> 01:58:27.733]  You want answers?
[01:58:27.733 --> 01:58:28.674]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:28.674 --> 01:58:33.479]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:33.479 --> 01:58:35.841]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:58:36.696 --> 01:58:38.356]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:38.356 --> 01:58:42.457]  All the callers that have been holding, if you want you can talk to Alan Watt, if not you can hang up.
[01:58:42.457 --> 01:58:45.198]  But we're going to go to Andrew in London in a moment.
[01:58:45.198 --> 01:58:48.978]  That's all we have time for with Bob Chapman because we've got Alan Watt coming up.
[01:58:48.978 --> 01:58:51.719]  Everybody else will get to you.
[01:58:51.719 --> 01:58:52.739]  We just wanted to talk to Bob.
[01:58:52.739 --> 01:58:55.900]  You can hang up as I said.
[01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:59.660]  But Ted, do you have 50 buffaloes to offer today as well?
[01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:01.121]  I didn't get enough time to say that.
[01:59:01.121 --> 01:59:02.641]  I do have the buffaloes as well.
[01:59:03.382 --> 01:59:05.202]  And they're currently, right now, at $1,036.
[01:59:05.202 --> 01:59:12.344]  I am, again, going to limit that supply just to $50 because it's trickling.
[01:59:12.344 --> 01:59:13.865]  Those have huge premiums everywhere else.
[01:59:13.865 --> 01:59:20.566]  That's a lot more per ounce of gold than the francs, but that's more of a collectible because they're very scarce.
[01:59:20.566 --> 01:59:22.647]  The francs, the sovereigns, you've got them all, $800, $686, $2237.
[01:59:22.647 --> 01:59:24.667]  What was the final point you wanted to make, Ted?
[01:59:27.028 --> 01:59:33.930]  Well, the final point was you're talking about at some point in time, paper currency can't buy gold or won't buy gold, and that's already occurring.
[01:59:33.930 --> 01:59:41.811]  The supplies of gold in the physical market with the coins are drying up, and you're trying to trade paper for gold.
[01:59:41.811 --> 01:59:42.771]  I mean, think about it.
[01:59:42.771 --> 01:59:43.692]  Paper for gold.
[01:59:43.692 --> 01:59:45.592]  Why would paper be worth gold?
[01:59:45.592 --> 01:59:54.314]  And the only reason why it is is because the United States government has been, you know, living on a legacy that paper was once exchangeable for gold.
[01:59:55.040 --> 02:00:02.151]  And since then we've lost all fiscal responsibility and there's no budget that's being held with any kind of containment.
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:14.651]  And the printing press is just merging on, and obviously, paper will not buy gold in the future, and I suggest that you do it now while it can.
[02:00:14.651 --> 02:00:16.333]  800-686-2237.
[02:00:16.333 --> 02:00:17.013]  800-686-2237.
[02:00:17.013 --> 02:00:26.623]  You're not going to find a better deal on those Franks and Sovereigns anywhere else, and that's a great deal also on the Buffalos, but again, that's more of a collector coin because the mint sold out of them, what, six, eight months ago.
[02:00:26.623 --> 02:00:27.544]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[02:00:28.104 --> 02:00:29.505]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:00:29.505 --> 02:00:33.409]  You bet, and that goes throughout Sunday evening, I guess into Monday morning.
[02:00:33.409 --> 02:00:40.114]  Bob Chapman, we're going to take a call from London, Andrew, but in closing, anything you want to add to what Ted said?
[02:00:40.114 --> 02:00:42.897]  No, I think he covered it pretty good.
[02:00:42.897 --> 02:00:46.880]  Andrew in London, you're on the air with Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:47.220]  Go ahead.
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:52.285]  Hi guys, I know you guys recommend gold, and I think that's great.
[02:00:52.285 --> 02:00:56.088]  I wanted to ask you about treasury inflation protected securities.
[02:00:56.781 --> 02:01:10.592]  Well, the major problem is the linkage on the CPI figure is bogus.
[02:01:10.592 --> 02:01:25.503]  So if you have a two and a half percent yield on a inflation protected security, such as a 10 year note, and inflation in reality right now is probably somewhere
[02:01:25.942 --> 02:01:28.544]  In the vicinity of 11%.
[02:01:28.544 --> 02:01:34.968]  Why would one want to do that and have a guaranteed loss and pay taxes too?
[02:01:34.968 --> 02:01:35.328]  Right.
[02:01:35.328 --> 02:01:40.391]  I was just thinking as, you know, if you don't want to put everything into gold, then you might try some of these as well.
[02:01:40.391 --> 02:01:44.894]  But, um, I, I, I steer away from the U S currency.
[02:01:44.894 --> 02:01:48.937]  Uh, there's not a lot of people who agree with me, but that's, that's normal for me.
[02:01:48.937 --> 02:01:53.980]  And I've been recommending Swiss franc government bonds, uh, the whole lot.
[02:01:54.844 --> 02:01:57.665]  That, to me, is the best shot.
[02:01:57.665 --> 02:02:03.447]  But, the best shot among currencies, if that's where you have to be.
[02:02:03.447 --> 02:02:06.408]  If you don't have to be there, you gotta be in gold and silver.
[02:02:06.408 --> 02:02:11.830]  Right, and how do you recommend buying currencies, then?
[02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:13.570]  I essentially don't.
[02:02:13.570 --> 02:02:14.751]  Oh.
[02:02:14.751 --> 02:02:16.011]  Okay.
[02:02:16.011 --> 02:02:18.432]  I mean, sir, I think the bonds are a better vehicle.
[02:02:18.432 --> 02:02:23.694]  They usually yield about 1%, and if you must be there, I think that's the best shot.
[02:02:25.307 --> 02:02:26.869]  Okay, great, thanks.
[02:02:26.869 --> 02:02:30.212]  Sir, I mean, if you have tremendous assets, I would be greatly diversified.
[02:02:30.212 --> 02:02:36.258]  But for the average person, gold and silver is the way to go, or to have paid off property.
[02:02:36.258 --> 02:02:40.362]  But with property taxes, you really don't own it, and they can take it that way too, right, Bob?
[02:02:40.362 --> 02:02:41.683]  That's right.
[02:02:41.683 --> 02:02:46.267]  So you've got to have some of those Federal Reserve notes available in order to pay that tax.
[02:02:46.267 --> 02:02:47.789]  It's extraordinarily important.
[02:02:48.522 --> 02:02:49.002]  All right.
[02:02:49.002 --> 02:02:55.886]  Bob Chapman, I want to thank you folks and get a free copy of the International Forecaster when they call Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:02:55.886 --> 02:02:58.788]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:58.788 --> 02:03:02.790]  I want to thank you for coming on.
[02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:05.532]  We'll talk to you again next week, Lord willing.
[02:03:05.532 --> 02:03:05.932]  Okay.
[02:03:05.932 --> 02:03:06.633]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:03:06.633 --> 02:03:07.233]  Bye-bye.
[02:03:07.233 --> 02:03:07.813]  Thank you, Bob.
[02:03:07.813 --> 02:03:08.414]  There he goes.
[02:03:08.414 --> 02:03:08.654]  All right.
[02:03:08.654 --> 02:03:09.695]  We'll come back with Alan Watts.
[02:03:09.695 --> 02:03:10.095]  Stay with me.
[02:03:16.923 --> 02:03:18.585]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:18.585 --> 02:03:23.332]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:03:23.332 --> 02:03:26.316]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:03:26.316 --> 02:03:29.360]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:34.086]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:03:34.286 --> 02:03:35.468]  If you simply prepare.
[02:03:35.468 --> 02:03:39.213]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[02:03:39.213 --> 02:03:41.276]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[02:03:41.276 --> 02:03:43.118]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[02:03:43.118 --> 02:03:47.083]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[02:03:47.083 --> 02:03:49.527]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[02:03:49.887 --> 02:03:59.016]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[02:03:59.016 --> 02:04:06.123]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[02:04:06.123 --> 02:04:08.125]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[02:04:08.345 --> 02:04:10.565]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[02:04:10.565 --> 02:04:16.247]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[02:04:16.247 --> 02:04:19.487]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[02:04:19.487 --> 02:04:22.848]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[02:04:22.848 --> 02:04:24.668]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[02:04:24.668 --> 02:04:28.729]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[02:04:28.729 --> 02:04:31.170]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared.
[02:04:31.170 --> 02:04:32.010]  Get self-sufficient.
[02:04:32.190 --> 02:04:32.871]  Get food.
[02:04:32.871 --> 02:04:40.396]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the New World Order, has a lot less control over you.
[02:04:40.396 --> 02:04:41.597]  And so it's a mindset.
[02:04:41.597 --> 02:04:44.340]  A mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:47.582]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:04:47.582 --> 02:04:54.567]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:04:54.567 --> 02:04:57.650]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:04:57.830 --> 02:05:02.995]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:09.241]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, pre-scribed and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:05:09.241 --> 02:05:13.024]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:05:13.024 --> 02:05:14.385]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:05:14.385 --> 02:05:15.006]  Take action today.
[02:05:15.006 --> 02:05:16.828]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:39.732]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[02:05:39.732 --> 02:05:48.759]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:05:48.759 --> 02:05:51.081]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:05:55.729 --> 02:06:08.757]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:06:08.757 --> 02:06:11.078]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:06:11.078 --> 02:06:13.560]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:06:15.723 --> 02:06:21.708]  Mercury-containing vacuums may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:06:21.708 --> 02:06:28.954]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:06:28.954 --> 02:06:33.958]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:06:33.958 --> 02:06:36.900]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:41.183]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[02:06:41.183 --> 02:06:44.126]  We have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[02:06:45.473 --> 02:06:49.496]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:06:49.496 --> 02:06:50.797]  Well, join me.
[02:06:50.797 --> 02:06:53.178]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[02:06:53.178 --> 02:06:56.540]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:06:56.540 --> 02:07:03.064]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:07:13.055 --> 02:07:14.579]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:14.579 --> 02:07:16.685]  We are live.
[02:07:16.685 --> 02:07:17.608]  Friday, the ninth day.
[02:07:19.244 --> 02:07:31.207]  Of January 2009, we are the good ship humanity, steaming straight in to the New World Order super typhoon that intends to sink us.
[02:07:31.207 --> 02:07:35.509]  I see the gullible, poisoned, hypnotized public.
[02:07:35.509 --> 02:07:43.491]  They're like little children, so trusting, having no idea the grid that is being built and tightened around their little throats.
[02:07:44.611 --> 02:08:00.142]  But, as history has shown, the public is generally outplaying foolishly, and it is up to the good men and women of honor, of decency, who love humanity, and who understand the danger of corruption and wickedness, to stand up and fight.
[02:08:00.142 --> 02:08:03.144]  And if we take the field, they will fail.
[02:08:03.144 --> 02:08:05.406]  The New World Order will fall.
[02:08:05.406 --> 02:08:06.567]  We don't have a choice.
[02:08:06.567 --> 02:08:07.628]  They're giving us no quarter.
[02:08:08.598 --> 02:08:11.260]  CuttingToTheMatrix.com is our guest website.
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:12.401]  CuttingToTheMatrix.com.
[02:08:12.401 --> 02:08:16.004]  My websites of course are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:08:16.004 --> 02:08:17.246]  And he joins us every few weeks.
[02:08:17.246 --> 02:08:20.368]  We're always honored to have him join us from Canada.
[02:08:20.368 --> 02:08:21.609]  He is Alan Watt.
[02:08:21.609 --> 02:08:24.712]  He's with us for the next hour and 50 minutes.
[02:08:24.712 --> 02:08:26.954]  Alan Watt, we didn't do any pre-interview.
[02:08:26.954 --> 02:08:31.037]  Whatever you want to get into today, I'd love to break it down, any of the latest news developments.
[02:08:31.978 --> 02:08:34.499]  The establishment is accelerating their announcement.
[02:08:34.499 --> 02:08:38.701]  They are setting up a world bank to be the world government.
[02:08:38.701 --> 02:08:43.662]  They are admitting just so much of their agenda right now out of the gates.
[02:08:43.662 --> 02:08:55.647]  Why is the establishment, after denying all this for all these decades, now emerging and admitting that they indeed are setting up a tyrannical world government, but for our own good, in quotes?
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:03.063]  I think, to be honest with you, that they're so sure of themselves now they have the whole thing in the bag.
[02:09:03.063 --> 02:09:06.785]  They do control all of society.
[02:09:06.785 --> 02:09:14.930]  The cultures of every country in the world now are interdependent, the same as the economy, as the cultures are as well.
[02:09:14.930 --> 02:09:20.853]  It all comes from Hollywood and television, the same newscasters, etc., worldwide.
[02:09:20.853 --> 02:09:22.814]  And so they're pretty sure of themselves, plus
[02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:33.580]  They have all of academia worldwide sewn up on board with this agenda and they do know and have written about this in the past that it was essential
[02:09:34.318 --> 02:09:41.360]  To get academia on their side because they become the future leaders, bureaucrats, CEOs of corporations and so on.
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:53.183]  So when they're all trained in the same tunnel vision of this world order, they think that the people, they call them the proles, as Orwell called them too, the proles are not even relevant.
[02:09:53.183 --> 02:09:55.743]  The masses don't even know what's happening.
[02:09:55.743 --> 02:09:57.524]  And most of them, to be honest with you, don't really care.
[02:09:58.833 --> 02:10:01.034]  So this has always been their standard philosophy.
[02:10:01.034 --> 02:10:17.300]  We saw them when they set up the communist system as a dialectic to help bring all this about, that communism was spread from the universities, from professors downwards, and that became the prevalent culture within society in the Western Hemisphere.
[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:26.824]  Now they're bringing the both together, but they truly do have all the basic academic sciences on board with all of this agenda, including eugenics,
[02:10:27.721 --> 02:10:38.625]  Including the necessity to depopulate drastically, rapidly, and also to get rid of what they see now as the useless eaters that would be left over from a previous society.
[02:10:38.625 --> 02:10:46.909]  They're going into the new world order with the new man and a much reduced society of what they think are the better gene types.
[02:10:46.909 --> 02:10:55.292]  The old man now, according to the Darwinian principle, which they're all grounded on, is now obsolete and cannot be brought through into the new system.
[02:10:57.421 --> 02:11:05.208]  Now to be specific, we're not even debating whether there's evolution or whether that theory had some basis in reality.
[02:11:05.208 --> 02:11:06.889]  We're not debating that either or.
[02:11:06.889 --> 02:11:25.005]  The fact is that's their governing system through social Darwinism and eugenics, and so that's their rationale for all the horrors that they carry out when in reality, from studying the elites, inner bread we know causes a lot of psychotic behavior, delusions of grandeur, a lot of other behaviors.
[02:11:25.425 --> 02:11:42.370]  So really we have a aberrant strain of malfunctioning humanity who are very intelligent and well-organized, but also psychopathic sociopaths and a gaggle of fellow travelers who only have certain pieces of the puzzle.
[02:11:42.370 --> 02:11:50.372]  And then you have all these subgroups that believe they're at the highest echelons of power when they're really in lower echelons of the pyramidal power structure who revel
[02:11:51.950 --> 02:11:53.191]  Excuse me.
[02:11:53.191 --> 02:12:09.496]  In the raw exercise of mindless power, and that's why when you talk to these mid-level elitist and technicians and university professors that say they want to kill the majority of the public, they're that very infantile and aren't very intelligent.
[02:12:09.496 --> 02:12:12.137]  But if you talk to one of the higher-level globalists, they are intelligent.
[02:12:12.797 --> 02:12:25.760]  Can you go through that and the way this is broken down from your research in different subgroup directives and the type of mindset of these petty power people who believe that they're members of the elite?
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:29.361]  Yes, there's a book out there people should try and get a hold of.
[02:12:29.361 --> 02:12:36.022]  It's called Political Ponerology and it's about the study of evil in mankind.
[02:12:36.022 --> 02:12:40.423]  Something that was studied in ancient times but not so much today because they don't believe in evil.
[02:12:41.492 --> 02:12:45.214]  Or the outcomes of evil, there's always someone that benefits, therefore it's okay.
[02:12:45.214 --> 02:12:50.417]  That's basically the Kabbalistic form of it, which they're all on board with too.
[02:12:50.417 --> 02:13:00.903]  But Ponderology, this book, goes into psychopathy and how the elite and all nations, all peoples, are basically psychopathic.
[02:13:00.903 --> 02:13:04.925]  They rise to the top in every society because they're ruthless.
[02:13:06.025 --> 02:13:08.187]  They have no conscience whatsoever.
[02:13:08.187 --> 02:13:09.168]  They're very cunning.
[02:13:09.168 --> 02:13:10.229]  They have certain traits.
[02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:20.420]  A psychopath will feel no emotion for other people outside his own little circle or what he owns or he sees which he owns.
[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:21.501]  But he's very good at it.
[02:13:21.501 --> 02:13:26.606]  He's like a camera who studies other people as he grows up, watching how they behave and interact.
[02:13:27.472 --> 02:13:36.876]  And they become tremendous salesmen, they become politicians, they do gravitate towards positions of power, but they're also sadomasochistic in their makeup.
[02:13:36.876 --> 02:13:52.522]  This came out at the Nuremberg trial, where studies were done on the followers, the higher followers of Hitler, and they glorified Hitler to the very end, and yet they despised the weaker officers beneath them.
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:54.680]  So that is sadomasochism.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:14:06.983]  You will worship the person with more power than you have yourself, and you'll do his bidding immediately with no questions concerned, and you will despise the lessors beneath you.
[02:14:06.983 --> 02:14:12.665]  That is sadomasochistic, and that's a standard part of this whole system in which we live.
[02:14:12.665 --> 02:14:17.766]  In other words, since the creation of commerce and money
[02:14:18.542 --> 02:14:27.905]  And the debt system and banking and so on, and the armies they can finance to take over other countries, seize their assets, resources and so on.
[02:14:27.905 --> 02:14:33.087]  We've always had the same types gravitating to the top in all societies.
[02:14:33.087 --> 02:14:47.272]  In fact, history is just the stories, his stories basically, that's what history is, of the ruling elites who gain power by being ruthless and merciless towards other people or rivals.
[02:14:47.884 --> 02:14:51.347]  And we have them today in an organized system.
[02:14:51.347 --> 02:14:53.029]  This is the problem.
[02:14:53.029 --> 02:14:58.594]  Now, all many subcultures, you might see nations in fact, have their top gang at the top.
[02:14:58.594 --> 02:15:02.978]  Whoever is at the top of the tree in Japan, China, wherever, is a gang.
[02:15:02.978 --> 02:15:08.823]  It's basically a gang with the most power and they're all psychopathic in their origins.
[02:15:08.823 --> 02:15:10.685]  Today we have an international
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:12.000]  I don't think so.
[02:15:36.298 --> 02:15:52.308]  And therefore they have concluded that they are the fittest and they've proven their worth by gaining power, holding on to it intergenerationally, marrying the right types, because the wives are selected for them in these groups and have been for hundreds of years.
[02:15:52.308 --> 02:16:03.775]  And Alan, we have, just to add a point going back, I was backing you up, you see it in the press, you see it in sociology reports, that in Washington D.C., in New York, in London,
[02:16:04.395 --> 02:16:05.276]  That's right.
[02:16:22.876 --> 02:16:33.686]  Normally goes both ways, that really is, and then the greatest extension of that is they love to torture small children to death, because again it's that great power and they love hurting something innocent.
[02:16:33.686 --> 02:16:49.040]  Would you say in these interlocking, when we come back I want to go through from your study the different gangs we have, that at the next to the highest level of the pyramid is the scientific gang, where whoever is the most cold-blooded is who is admired, and then above that is the elite families.
[02:16:49.992 --> 02:16:50.573]  There's no doubt.
[02:16:50.573 --> 02:17:01.447]  In fact, Huxley himself went through the whole strata of the dominant minority and the scientific elite who were especially bred, including his own group, to help this dominant minority.
[02:17:03.439 --> 02:17:05.741]  And then I want to get into the cloning.
[02:17:05.741 --> 02:17:07.303]  The designer baby's already happening.
[02:17:07.303 --> 02:17:09.785]  The cloned cows, the cloned milk.
[02:17:09.785 --> 02:17:12.508]  They're now having to put on milk that it's cloned or it isn't cloned.
[02:17:12.508 --> 02:17:20.736]  I mean, where this Brave New World is going with the amazing guest, Alan Watt, on this Live Friday edition.
[02:17:20.736 --> 02:17:22.038]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:25.376 --> 02:17:32.120]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:34.762]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:17:34.762 --> 02:17:36.323]  But who is the enemy?
[02:17:36.323 --> 02:17:37.123]  Bin Laden.
[02:17:37.123 --> 02:17:38.064]  This is his ammo.
[02:17:38.064 --> 02:17:39.465]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:17:39.465 --> 02:17:41.466]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:17:41.466 --> 02:17:48.630]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:17:48.630 --> 02:17:49.110]  Some U.S.
[02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:54.734]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:17:55.434 --> 02:17:58.957]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:17:58.957 --> 02:18:01.759]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:18:26.664 --> 02:18:29.006]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[02:18:29.006 --> 02:18:35.252]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[02:19:03.311 --> 02:19:03.771]  You worry.
[02:19:03.771 --> 02:19:05.812]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:19:05.812 --> 02:19:07.553]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:19:07.553 --> 02:19:09.034]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[02:19:35.435 --> 02:19:35.935]  We're good to go.
[02:20:05.478 --> 02:20:08.881]  Where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[02:20:08.881 --> 02:20:12.904]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[02:20:16.606 --> 02:20:17.387]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:17.387 --> 02:20:19.288]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:20:25.197 --> 02:20:27.178]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:27.178 --> 02:20:34.140]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:42.542]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:42.542 --> 02:20:48.264]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:20:48.464 --> 02:20:50.286]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:20:50.286 --> 02:20:52.467]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:20:52.467 --> 02:20:57.011]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:20:57.011 --> 02:20:59.233]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:20:59.233 --> 02:21:07.099]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:21:07.159 --> 02:21:07.899]  We're good to go.
[02:21:37.498 --> 02:21:42.937]  Okay, let's go right back to Alan Wad.
[02:21:42.937 --> 02:21:43.699]  Breaking down.
[02:21:45.985 --> 02:21:56.227]  Exactly who these elite are and again, they've written thousands of books on it thousands of papers and they laugh and say look at the slave scum They can't even read what we're saying.
[02:21:56.227 --> 02:22:03.409]  We're gonna do to them and they say that's prima facie Evidence I've had as you I know had Alan elitist say Alex.
[02:22:03.409 --> 02:22:07.190]  Look you tell them and they don't even listen to you See you need to join us
[02:22:08.263 --> 02:22:10.084]  And I say, listen, I'm a nurturative person.
[02:22:10.084 --> 02:22:12.306]  I know what I do to others comes back on me.
[02:22:12.306 --> 02:22:14.387]  You know, you people are evil.
[02:22:14.387 --> 02:22:16.289]  And you've helped dumb people down.
[02:22:16.289 --> 02:22:21.192]  You've accelerated the domestication and the institutionalization of the public.
[02:22:21.192 --> 02:22:25.835]  And this is a great crime against life, against our species, against humanity.
[02:22:25.835 --> 02:22:28.757]  And they just snicker.
[02:22:28.757 --> 02:22:32.640]  Or they act sad and go, well, you just don't know the law of nature, do you?
[02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:34.381]  We're just doing something inevitable.
[02:22:34.381 --> 02:22:36.463]  If we didn't act like this, somebody else would.
[02:22:37.719 --> 02:22:39.200]  Alan Watt.
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:41.883]  Yeah, that's exactly how they rationalize it.
[02:22:41.883 --> 02:22:51.591]  As I say, through the Darwinian studies of different species and so on, they were done through the sea urchins and all these things, and different groups that came down through the ages.
[02:22:51.591 --> 02:22:54.214]  They've never found missing links, but that's not the point.
[02:22:54.214 --> 02:22:57.256]  The point is, things go extinct.
[02:22:57.256 --> 02:23:01.300]  And we do have evidence of that, different animals go extinct.
[02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:03.742]  So they put man in the same category
[02:23:04.332 --> 02:23:04.632]  Thank you.
[02:23:17.307 --> 02:23:17.807]  I don't think so.
[02:23:45.794 --> 02:23:49.515]  God evolved even higher and bring down that high group.
[02:23:49.515 --> 02:23:51.035]  That's what they truly believe.
[02:23:51.035 --> 02:23:54.256]  This is identical to Hinduism.
[02:23:54.256 --> 02:24:04.598]  Hinduism goes through this, and I think that's the connecting link between much of higher Freemasonry and this New World Order.
[02:24:04.598 --> 02:24:10.639]  In Hinduism, they believe there are cycles in nature that last millions of years, different phases.
[02:24:10.639 --> 02:24:11.879]  They call them ages.
[02:24:12.674 --> 02:24:30.110]  And at the end of each age those that evolve, remember they start from slime into amoebas and through animals through transmigration of souls and all this kind of stuff, and eventually they get to this advanced type and they go on into the next wave while the old type dies off.
[02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:37.957]  It's identical to Darwinism and you have to ask yourself, did Darwinism come first or did they simply copy the Hinduistic philosophies?
[02:24:39.241 --> 02:24:43.328]  Or the Babylonian Mysterial Religions is the same thing.
[02:24:43.328 --> 02:24:51.101]  Transhumanists, now the low-level kind of porch transhumanists, like porch masons, don't know or haven't read the real dogma, but
[02:24:53.092 --> 02:25:00.337]  Aldous Huxley's brother, the head UN eugenicist, the head eugenicist worldwide at the time, he said, we've got to change to transhumanism.
[02:25:00.337 --> 02:25:20.871]  So transhumanism, the founder of it says, it is the new name for eugenics, and he says, and now they say at these big eugenics conferences, transhumanist conferences they have, or posthumanists, they say, you will take brain chips, you will evolve into cybernetic, if we even let you, if you prove your worth, and all the rest of you will die because you're not evolving.
[02:25:21.451 --> 02:25:25.176]  And so, you know, we face it on that front.
[02:25:25.176 --> 02:25:27.959]  Yes, as I say, it's all out in the open today.
[02:25:27.959 --> 02:25:33.567]  And what's interesting, too, is their use of words or linguistics.
[02:25:33.567 --> 02:25:35.249]  Some call it psycho linguistics.
[02:25:36.053 --> 02:25:39.795]  And some of the neuroscientists call it neurolinguistics.
[02:25:39.795 --> 02:25:50.942]  By the use of different words to cover up the same agenda that used to be called eugenics, the general population are using those new words thinking it's all okay.
[02:25:50.942 --> 02:25:54.023]  They can't relate it to what it used to mean.
[02:25:54.023 --> 02:26:01.868]  It's the same thing as having a communist society, and as long as no one at the top mentions communism, no one will see for what it really is.
[02:26:01.868 --> 02:26:05.110]  So we tend to get stuck on words we can't see beyond that.
[02:26:06.214 --> 02:26:11.358]  Today they call it globalization, but it is a sovietized world system they're bringing in.
[02:26:11.358 --> 02:26:15.161]  It's a communistic system they're bringing in for the masses.
[02:26:15.161 --> 02:26:18.984]  Now communism or the Soviet system was created by the West.
[02:26:18.984 --> 02:26:22.666]  It did not originate in the Soviet Union or Russia.
[02:26:22.666 --> 02:26:34.535]  Its whole theory was that man was an animal that can be trained to go in any direction whatsoever through scientific means and indoctrination and using conditioned responses
[02:26:35.559 --> 02:26:38.181]  Uh, they could take them to wherever they wanted them to be.
[02:26:38.181 --> 02:26:44.747]  Lenin himself said, he says, we shall decide, uh, what kind of culture to give the public, which is good for the party.
[02:26:44.747 --> 02:26:49.831]  And if that culture becomes obsolete or doesn't serve the party, we'll all then change the entire culture again.
[02:26:49.831 --> 02:26:57.518]  In other words, all of reality will keep changing and be updated and the public will accept it like a computer program being upgraded.
[02:26:57.518 --> 02:27:00.420]  That's exactly how they're treating the public today.
[02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:02.302]  And unfortunately it's working very well.
[02:27:02.782 --> 02:27:05.245]  Alan Watt, long segment coming up.
[02:27:05.245 --> 02:27:07.767]  When we start the next hour, we'll go directly to your phone calls.
[02:27:07.767 --> 02:27:11.971]  If you want to get lined up, 800-259-9231.
[02:27:11.971 --> 02:27:15.715]  Stay with us.
[02:27:15.715 --> 02:27:17.096]  We're on the march.
[02:27:17.096 --> 02:27:19.639]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:19.639 --> 02:27:22.322]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:25.453 --> 02:27:28.895]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:27:28.895 --> 02:27:33.156]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:27:33.156 --> 02:27:41.120]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:44.823]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:27:44.823 --> 02:27:50.948]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:27:50.948 --> 02:27:55.611]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[02:27:55.611 --> 02:28:03.818]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[02:28:03.818 --> 02:28:10.483]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care
[02:28:14.401 --> 02:28:20.084]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:28:20.084 --> 02:28:24.166]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:28:24.166 --> 02:28:31.130]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:28:31.130 --> 02:28:33.591]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:28:33.591 --> 02:28:35.272]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:28:35.272 --> 02:28:38.193]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:28:38.193 --> 02:28:41.795]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:56.338]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:28:56.338 --> 02:28:57.440]  An inside job.
[02:29:00.123 --> 02:29:02.744]  How dare you?
[02:29:02.744 --> 02:29:07.785]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:29:07.785 --> 02:29:14.907]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:29:14.907 --> 02:29:16.988]  Truth Rising.

[02:29:22.089 --> 02:29:24.570]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:29:25.672 --> 02:29:29.733]  Do you have aches and pains or suffer from indigestion or inflammation?
[02:29:29.733 --> 02:29:32.434]  Are you tired of feeling restless from insomnia?
[02:29:32.434 --> 02:29:39.796]  These symptoms are produced by negative toxins, but with the correct information, understanding, and care, you can cleanse them from your body.
[02:29:39.796 --> 02:29:44.937]  Allomaster.com would like to help you begin the road to recovery with aloe vera.
[02:29:44.937 --> 02:29:53.619]  For over 4,000 years, aloe vera has been known for its therapeutic and healing properties and is widely recognized as the plant that helps alleviate minor burns.
[02:29:54.059 --> 02:30:02.566]  Allomaster.com picks the best aloe leaves and produces the most potent aloe vera concentrated juices and freeze-dried capsules you can find.
[02:30:02.566 --> 02:30:10.232]  Allomaster.com offers products with 10 times the potency of ordinary aloe products, enhancing the benefits of this ancient cleansing plant.

[02:30:18.034 --> 02:30:19.694]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:19.694 --> 02:30:21.795]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:40.521 --> 02:30:42.142]  Alan Watts.
[02:30:42.142 --> 02:30:49.088]  Let's get into what the establishment is doing with genetic engineering.
[02:30:49.088 --> 02:31:07.464]  I have interviewed and, of course, read hundreds and hundreds of news stories and reports, as I know you have, top scientists in genetic engineering who were for it until they found out that, well, I change one gene in a tomato or potato and it gets the change I want, but it randomly, each life cycle,
[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:25.054]  Changes hundreds if not thousands of things randomly and creates new amino acids, new chemicals, new components, new ring structures, new enzymes that are very, very toxic to other life forms that consume it or come in contact with it.
[02:31:25.054 --> 02:31:27.256]  The establishment knows that.
[02:31:27.256 --> 02:31:29.859]  They are testing in the open ocean.
[02:31:30.928 --> 02:31:43.978]  New forms of chemical-eating bacteria, oil-slick-eating bacteria, which in studies they admit could start replicating and, you know, could create global red tides that could possibly kill a lot of the life in the ocean.
[02:31:43.978 --> 02:31:45.660]  That's, you know, one little example.
[02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:56.748]  Or these cross-species, where they put human genes in a pig so they can get heart valves out of it, or grow, which they know, which they admit they're doing, but they keep a lot of the details quiet for at least a decade, BBC reports.
[02:31:57.569 --> 02:32:06.236]  Humanoids, part human, part bovine, part cow, so they can grow the embryos up to full baby size so they can harvest organs.
[02:32:06.236 --> 02:32:07.317]  We know that's going on.
[02:32:07.317 --> 02:32:18.546]  Part chimpanzee, part human, part human, part goat, part goat, part spider, or they have some transgenetic organisms that have over 200 different species.
[02:32:18.546 --> 02:32:23.050]  Plant animal, jellyfish, they're selling on the open market.
[02:32:23.050 --> 02:32:25.152]  Cats that glow in the dark, monkeys that glow in the dark.
[02:32:25.852 --> 02:32:45.841]  That have jellyfish skin, and you tell the public they laugh and giggle and say that doesn't exist, but even though it's on the market, you know, just thousands of things randomly going on, huge facilities randomly with gene guns, firing different genetics into plants, animals, sea life openly releasing them.
[02:32:45.841 --> 02:32:50.263]  You know, now there's many areas of the world more GMO salmon than there are the other salmon.
[02:32:50.263 --> 02:32:53.785]  They're now out competing them, removing them, and then they have a
[02:32:54.125 --> 02:32:54.585]  I don't know.
[02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:20.621]  In fact, if we get bored, we may just nuke the planet because of the power of killing ourselves and destroying the species forever.
[02:33:20.621 --> 02:33:21.682]  It's so beautiful.
[02:33:21.682 --> 02:33:28.403]  And Lennon said, you know, I would love to just, he would write poems about destroying the earth and killing everyone and how beautiful it would be.
[02:33:28.403 --> 02:33:30.424]  So really, they're not survival of the fittest.
[02:33:30.424 --> 02:33:40.166]  A true fittest would understand the species, have love for it, would have compassion, would be endowed, you know, that strain of our species with
[02:33:43.226 --> 02:33:58.711]  Understanding how dangerous this all is, moving carefully with it, trying to empower everyone, trying to lift the species to a higher level, peacefully trying to colonize space instead of dumbing down, hoarding, controlling, poisoning, and endangering the entire biosphere.
[02:33:58.711 --> 02:34:00.592]  And that's a long two-minute question.
[02:34:00.592 --> 02:34:03.913]  Specifically, you know, with that whole field of information,
[02:34:05.063 --> 02:34:10.144]  I see them as actually very aberrant and self-destructive, and in their own words, they admit that.
[02:34:10.144 --> 02:34:12.185]  So they need to be removed from power right now.
[02:34:12.185 --> 02:34:16.886]  They're mid-level servants who are just in the power trip of killing 90% and running things.
[02:34:16.886 --> 02:34:22.788]  I don't think they've studied their own master's blueprint that really, at the end of the day, they just want to kill everybody, including themselves.
[02:34:22.788 --> 02:34:34.111]  It's possible, but what I've also noticed too, for many years, is that whatever is released to the public to do with science is generally obsolete.
[02:34:34.938 --> 02:34:49.750]  The time we get a hold of the information, there's a much higher level of science that we can... When you understand that Huxley himself wrote Brave New World in 1933, with all of that data to do with genes and so on, long before
[02:34:51.552 --> 02:34:54.294]  They really discovered the genes, we are told.
[02:34:54.294 --> 02:35:03.441]  They were still teaching in the 70s, the 60s and 70s, in medicine, that they suspected that genes lived on chromosomes, but they couldn't prove it.
[02:35:03.441 --> 02:35:12.487]  And yet here's Huxley writing in 1933 about a science that had not even come in at that time in the general university.
[02:35:12.487 --> 02:35:18.132]  And mass drugging of the public and forced abortions and total control, what they're now setting up.
[02:35:18.132 --> 02:35:18.432]  Go ahead.
[02:35:19.264 --> 02:35:33.508]  And at the same point, when you break it down to genes to do with the Human Genome Project, basically that thing was on the go once again before they were so advanced in understanding the genes.
[02:35:33.508 --> 02:35:35.189]  So who's telling the truth?
[02:35:35.189 --> 02:35:43.531]  The ones who are doing the research at the bottom and learning it all over again, or a much higher group above them that already knows all of this stuff?
[02:35:43.531 --> 02:35:47.052]  And what we find with the Elite Two, they have incredible faith
[02:35:47.552 --> 02:35:54.276]  Absolute faith in their own ingenuity and with the use of science they believe they can go on forever indefinitely.
[02:35:54.276 --> 02:35:58.878]  And I think that a very high level of ironed all of these problems out.
[02:35:58.878 --> 02:36:01.840]  They talk about reseeding the planet if need be.
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:09.604]  They have warehouses, storehouses, where they have all the genes of the entire planet of plant, insects, animal and so on.
[02:36:09.604 --> 02:36:12.926]  So they have the giant underground labyrinths that they admit they have.
[02:36:12.926 --> 02:36:13.446]  Lord knows what
[02:36:14.804 --> 02:36:21.807]  What they have that we're not aware of, and so they're prepared for that, and that may be even in their plan is to wreck everything to then rebuild it.
[02:36:21.807 --> 02:36:22.788]  It could very well be.
[02:36:22.788 --> 02:36:30.231]  I remember watching one of the Star Trek movies, and remember Gene Roddenberry was a member of ANASA.
[02:36:30.231 --> 02:36:32.052]  The Genesis Project.
[02:36:32.052 --> 02:36:33.552]  The Genesis Project, yeah.
[02:36:33.552 --> 02:36:40.095]  And he was also a member of the First Earth Army to start the greening process for conservation and really to conserve humans.
[02:36:43.357 --> 02:36:43.877]  We're good to go.
[02:37:02.924 --> 02:37:18.231]  That if, by some fluke, they don't get their way, because they do hold all the powers or the reins of power across the planet today, if they don't get their way, they will have something up their sleeves where they would go ahead and pull this off.
[02:37:18.231 --> 02:37:25.734]  Because they truly have utter faith in their own ability and acquired knowledge of sciences that's hidden from the public.
[02:37:25.734 --> 02:37:28.856]  We, as I say, we get obsolete stuff at the bottom level.
[02:37:29.917 --> 02:37:31.177]  That's why they call it research.
[02:37:31.177 --> 02:37:34.578]  It's been done before at a higher level.
[02:37:34.578 --> 02:37:35.738]  We'll take Ian Fleming.
[02:37:35.738 --> 02:37:36.999]  I mentioned this yesterday.
[02:37:36.999 --> 02:37:50.601]  In the early 50s, he writes his second book, James Bond, Moonraker, where the elite are going to kill everybody, go to a space station, and then come back after the biological weapons killed everyone and reseat with the eugenic superculture.
[02:37:50.601 --> 02:37:53.982]  This is a high-level MI6 agent, OSS agent.
[02:37:54.582 --> 02:38:04.387]  And then now their newest James Bond is where there's a fake global environmental group using fake carbon taxes to bring in a world tyranny.
[02:38:04.387 --> 02:38:06.227]  They're just flaunting it in our face.
[02:38:06.227 --> 02:38:08.929]  Yes, they are flaunting it in our face.
[02:38:08.929 --> 02:38:14.691]  And it's interesting, the World Wildlife Fund has what they call three arcs on the planet.
[02:38:14.691 --> 02:38:15.972]  One of them is in Louisiana.
[02:38:17.142 --> 02:38:25.111]  And in there, they have cryogenics with, again, every possible gene from every possible animal, insect, etc.
[02:38:25.111 --> 02:38:27.694]  in those particular arcs.
[02:38:27.694 --> 02:38:35.342]  And they said, and this program is a public broadcasting program with a professor who's in charge of that particular one arc.
[02:38:35.342 --> 02:38:36.023]  She said there's three.
[02:38:36.883 --> 02:38:39.685]  That this will be used if anything happened to planet Earth.
[02:38:39.685 --> 02:38:42.527]  They can reseed the planet with everything they have there.
[02:38:42.527 --> 02:38:43.828]  And they've tested this stuff out.
[02:38:43.828 --> 02:38:54.136]  They have brought ovum and sperm together from different creatures and they've inserted them into other types of creatures and successfully brought them to term.
[02:38:54.136 --> 02:39:05.304]  So they can literally breed any kind of animal or even a human inside another animal if need be and bring it to term after being stored in cryogenics for who knows how long.
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:12.725]  So we're talking about dolphins with human brains.
[02:39:12.725 --> 02:39:13.526]  It's endless.
[02:39:13.526 --> 02:39:15.528]  Well, I agree with what you just said.
[02:39:15.528 --> 02:39:20.974]  I believe that, well we know, that they're at least 30, 40 years ahead and that's exponential.
[02:39:20.974 --> 02:39:22.636]  And so that's why they're so arrogant now.
[02:39:23.937 --> 02:39:27.558]  In the time frame, how do you see them with the soft kill weapons?
[02:39:27.558 --> 02:39:41.040]  They've already turned up the ambient background with the soft kill weapons, with the cancer viruses, with the barium and aluminum spraying on the public, with their operations worldwide.
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:47.882]  Go through the next 10 years and then out, and I understand this is a projection from your deep research.
[02:39:49.302 --> 02:39:55.365]  But I've done my separate research and that's what I'm always so impressed with is that you're always on the same line and even bring it further in many cases.
[02:39:55.365 --> 02:39:56.645]  That's why we're so honored to have you, Alan.
[02:39:56.645 --> 02:40:05.649]  I just really respect your intellect and research on this because I've come to the same organic analysis as you are here with my discernment.
[02:40:05.649 --> 02:40:14.333]  And discernment's really just your full mind capacity, the electrochemical computer you have, listeners, integrating all the information.
[02:40:14.333 --> 02:40:15.514]  And of course, their own statements.
[02:40:17.108 --> 02:40:30.693]  Break down specifically when you believe they'll start mass plagues or smaller plagues to get us herded into cities to train us to live under total control and into more of a THX 1138 type system, rats in the cage.
[02:40:32.313 --> 02:40:34.435]  When do the mass culls come?
[02:40:34.435 --> 02:40:37.937]  And will they use neutron bombs, as the Ministry of Defense says they may?
[02:40:37.937 --> 02:40:44.002]  Or will they use special, race-specific weapons, blaming it on imaginary terror groups and caves?
[02:40:44.002 --> 02:40:51.328]  And how will these phases unfold, and in what time frame, for the, I always said 80% extermination, that's in the public documents.
[02:40:51.328 --> 02:40:55.671]  Now they're, in the newest documents, saying, well really, it's 99%.
[02:40:55.671 --> 02:40:56.972]  We just told our underlings 80%.
[02:40:56.972 --> 02:41:00.194]  It's really, we're going to kill 99% of people.
[02:41:00.194 --> 02:41:00.775]  So, go ahead.
[02:41:01.826 --> 02:41:03.087]  Yes.
[02:41:03.087 --> 02:41:14.991]  When you go into the records of the think tanks that advise NATO, for instance, and the US military as well, they're identical.
[02:41:14.991 --> 02:41:17.832]  They're all identical, all the projections for the future.
[02:41:17.832 --> 02:41:23.955]  And this starts really with a statement right after 9-11, 2001, where they said this will be a hundred years war.
[02:41:25.163 --> 02:41:29.347]  And everyone was shaking their head, saying, well, why would it take a hundred years to finish off the Middle East?
[02:41:29.347 --> 02:41:30.688]  They weren't talking about the Middle East.
[02:41:30.688 --> 02:41:35.131]  They were talking about a long-term strategy plan for the entire planet.
[02:41:35.131 --> 02:41:39.935]  And these think tanks, in their own records, will always use history.
[02:41:39.935 --> 02:41:42.677]  They'll tell you where they get their ideas from.
[02:41:42.677 --> 02:41:49.123]  They go back into the Middle Ages, where they had plagues rampaging across the whole of Europe.
[02:41:49.123 --> 02:41:53.046]  But during those plague times, too, when many people were dying, millions of people died,
[02:41:53.649 --> 02:42:08.678]  They also had incredible wars going on at the same time, and the effects on the general populations were studied even then, often by monks who did the documentation, to see the effects on the public, who were truly mind-bombed.
[02:42:08.678 --> 02:42:18.304]  They were so afraid that the plague was going to get them, so much so, they'd allow armies to march through and pillage their food from them and their livestock, etc.
[02:42:18.304 --> 02:42:19.985]  And so when you see what they've dreamed up,
[02:42:20.777 --> 02:42:27.542]  In their documentation, there's a projection for the next 30 to 100 years for the military.
[02:42:27.542 --> 02:42:28.663]  It ties right in with that.
[02:42:28.663 --> 02:42:39.470]  They say that they expect starting around 2010, 2012, we will be a global society de facto.
[02:42:39.470 --> 02:42:41.271]  It will be signed into law.
[02:42:41.271 --> 02:42:43.973]  But then the plagues are coming.
[02:42:43.973 --> 02:42:45.815]  They expect them to come.
[02:42:45.815 --> 02:42:47.496]  So we'll have plagues just like the Middle Ages.
[02:42:48.294 --> 02:42:49.214]  Pandemics.
[02:42:49.214 --> 02:42:59.379]  Now, pandemics are ideal for bringing down a population of even the whole world, but not too suddenly, because a pandemic can be contained within an area.
[02:42:59.379 --> 02:43:05.042]  It can die off and reappear two or three years later and kill off more in the same area.
[02:43:05.042 --> 02:43:06.703]  So it's a long-term takedown.
[02:43:06.703 --> 02:43:10.104]  That way, the people who are alive can bury the dead.
[02:43:10.104 --> 02:43:10.945]  It's not untidy.
[02:43:10.945 --> 02:43:13.306]  They're all out of sight, etc.
[02:43:13.306 --> 02:43:15.247]  So we clean up our own mess as we die off.
[02:43:16.352 --> 02:43:23.136]  And at the same time, they expect that there's going to be massive food shortages, which they had again in the Middle Ages.
[02:43:23.136 --> 02:43:42.846]  And in the Middle Ages, where you had various armies competing with each other and kings for power in different countries, you're going to have a global society here where the people will be revolting for lack of food, because the food supply of the world is now tied up into about five corporations' hands.
[02:43:42.846 --> 02:43:45.147]  And we know the United Nations, under their own mandate,
[02:43:45.683 --> 02:43:45.883]  I think?
[02:44:01.573 --> 02:44:05.695]  For maximum population, the next year they're going to down that quota again.
[02:44:05.695 --> 02:44:11.498]  See, we know we told you this, but there's not enough food to go around, so you have to bring down your population.
[02:44:11.498 --> 02:44:16.441]  So each country, it'll be up to them to bring down their numbers one way or another.
[02:44:16.441 --> 02:44:26.726]  And at the same time this is happening, you're going to have a world military managing the riots to do with food primarily, and lack of necessities and medicines and so on.
[02:44:27.772 --> 02:44:28.373]  I don't think so.
[02:44:52.481 --> 02:45:06.404]  And they believe then that China will start to decline massively because even now I think their population is two to three or three males to every one female because they're encouraging infanticide there is mainly on the female.
[02:45:07.148 --> 02:45:09.730]  And therefore, they themselves will start to decline.
[02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:15.613]  And because once they're on the westernized food and inoculations, they will also start to become sterile.
[02:45:15.613 --> 02:45:25.260]  So within another, say, 2030 to 2050, 2060, the population of China will be drastically reduced as well.
[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:28.221]  So this is how they see the whole plan working out.
[02:45:28.221 --> 02:45:33.685]  And then they tie in the transhumanism agenda, where they'll bring out a new type
[02:45:34.185 --> 02:45:34.946]  We're good to go.
[02:45:56.856 --> 02:46:03.565]  Uh, and they're very, very efficient, and they can also be programmed to do different jobs because they'll also be part cyborg.
[02:46:03.565 --> 02:46:06.569]  That's really what they believe at the top.
[02:46:06.569 --> 02:46:10.955]  And this is through all the records of academia to do with transhumanism.
[02:46:11.656 --> 02:46:12.957]  That's what I wanted to add.
[02:46:12.957 --> 02:46:13.758]  That's what I wanted to add.
[02:46:13.758 --> 02:46:35.735]  They are, and will continue, they're sucking the youth in, and the Army said this, as you know, decades ago, declassified in 2001, 2000 in February, they said, we're going to use hype, video games, culture, to literally get the young people to want to be wireheads, and they'll rebel against mom and dad and say, hey, there's a law, I'm allowed to be augmented.
[02:46:35.735 --> 02:46:39.218]  And then the Washington Post admits that the corporations are getting the children ready,
[02:46:40.302 --> 02:47:05.734]  to rebel the teenagers to take the augmentation and then now one of the most famous video game company owners and inventors came out and said yes soon you'll need to be augmented with chips in your body to even play our game and the young people are already in their Sims reality there you know 20 million people in World of Warcraft this is their reality and so they're already being inserted into it the army said we're going to use xboxes now
[02:47:07.396 --> 02:47:24.391]  Uh, the very platform to have the teenagers fly our Predator drones and so they'll just sit there having fun dehumanizing, killing people, playing real games on an Xbox platform hooked into the Predator drones and then now they're at the malls with these huge video game displays.
[02:47:24.391 --> 02:47:26.653]  The Army, that's in the news today all over the country.
[02:47:27.173 --> 02:47:27.453]  Well,
[02:47:42.987 --> 02:47:44.548]  We're good to go.
[02:47:59.813 --> 02:48:11.480]  Repair centers that are robotic with basic human technicians that upkeep it to where the elite can just punch a button and launch giant attacks against countries and it won't matter if the troops even said no.
[02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:16.943]  So literal godlike powers now being seeded into the hands of the elite.
[02:48:16.943 --> 02:48:18.003]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[02:48:18.003 --> 02:48:20.165]  We're going to come back and get into the carbon footprint.
[02:48:21.025 --> 02:48:24.267]  Uh, the social youth brigades that are going to be in all your homes.
[02:48:24.267 --> 02:48:25.687]  Just the absolute enslavement.
[02:48:25.687 --> 02:48:27.188]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:48:27.188 --> 02:48:28.929]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:48:28.929 --> 02:48:31.630]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:48:31.630 --> 02:48:36.753]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:48:36.753 --> 02:48:39.954]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:49:24.582 --> 02:49:32.130]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:49:32.130 --> 02:49:33.772]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:49:34.747 --> 02:49:36.288]  But who is the enemy?
[02:49:36.288 --> 02:49:37.089]  Bin Laden.
[02:49:37.089 --> 02:49:38.130]  This is his M.O.
[02:49:38.130 --> 02:49:39.431]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:49:39.431 --> 02:49:41.453]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:49:41.453 --> 02:49:48.599]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:49:48.599 --> 02:49:49.080]  Some U.S.
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:54.725]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:49:55.425 --> 02:49:58.967]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:49:58.967 --> 02:50:01.729]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:50:25.390 --> 02:50:35.961]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[02:51:32.695 --> 02:51:46.059]  I'm sorry to some out there who are laughing at us right now.
[02:51:46.059 --> 02:51:53.982]  Who've been neutralized psychologically by the controllers.
[02:51:53.982 --> 02:51:57.623]  Because your own false identity that you've constructed for you
[02:52:00.067 --> 02:52:05.429]  Is what you believe is your intellect or your being is a false construct.
[02:52:05.429 --> 02:52:07.809]  So you can't go against who you believe you are.
[02:52:07.809 --> 02:52:09.990]  You have to deny what we're saying.
[02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:12.191]  It's all documented.
[02:52:12.191 --> 02:52:19.473]  Because you feel like your own enslavement is your soul.
[02:52:19.473 --> 02:52:22.714]  That's very sad because we need to try to avert this.
[02:52:22.714 --> 02:52:23.814]  We need to try to reverse this.
[02:52:23.814 --> 02:52:25.755]  We have a limited window in time in my opinion.
[02:52:27.503 --> 02:52:35.885]  To reverse what's happening, Alan, digressing for a moment, do you think we are in that limited window?
[02:52:35.885 --> 02:52:45.767]  I mean, I want to get into solutions later, and then B, continuing with the phasing out of humanity.
[02:52:45.767 --> 02:52:47.307]  I think we're well underway.
[02:52:47.307 --> 02:52:52.548]  We didn't know that we were being sterilized until the reports came out.
[02:52:52.548 --> 02:52:55.229]  The reports I've had for 50 years started to leak out.
[02:52:55.928 --> 02:52:57.629]  So we get the news 50 years later.
[02:52:57.629 --> 02:53:00.152]  This is how things are done.
[02:53:00.152 --> 02:53:04.815]  We're the last to be told any truth, or at least even effects of the truth.
[02:53:04.815 --> 02:53:08.158]  And they're well on their way to their objective.
[02:53:08.158 --> 02:53:10.760]  We're watching them go through this financial nonsense.
[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:14.163]  This is the power of the purse, the last thing to be used to unite the whole planet.
[02:53:15.368 --> 02:53:19.751]  And because we're all on the one economic system, we know no other way.
[02:53:19.751 --> 02:53:20.972]  This is all we've been given.
[02:53:20.972 --> 02:53:25.134]  This is all we can remember for thousands, a couple of thousand years.
[02:53:25.134 --> 02:53:29.157]  Then there seems to be no way out of it.
[02:53:29.157 --> 02:53:36.081]  So the power of the purse is going to force everyone along into the next phase of control.
[02:53:36.081 --> 02:53:39.123]  Money is used, remember, mainly as a tool by the elite.
[02:53:39.123 --> 02:53:41.084]  They don't need money.
[02:53:41.084 --> 02:53:43.426]  They already own everything, technically.
[02:53:44.082 --> 02:53:47.684]  They don't have to carry cash with them or even credit cards.
[02:53:47.684 --> 02:53:49.624]  Doors open wherever they go.
[02:53:49.624 --> 02:53:56.467]  But money is the trick to control the people and to get us to work along with their system for their system.
[02:53:56.467 --> 02:53:58.008]  Eventually they won't even need that.
[02:53:59.132 --> 02:54:08.934]  But part of the phase on the way to the elimination of money for the Brave New World will be a credit system that will come in for every citizen.
[02:54:08.934 --> 02:54:22.257]  And Bertrand Russell talked about this back in the 1950s, where the government, in collusion with the banks, will directly give you, into your account every week, a deposit which you cannot save up.
[02:54:22.257 --> 02:54:24.217]  So it starts at the same figure every Monday.
[02:54:25.243 --> 02:54:31.705]  And if you go against the system, you don't behave in a certain way or whatever, they will hold back your credits.
[02:54:31.705 --> 02:54:33.706]  You can't pay your rent and so on.
[02:54:33.706 --> 02:54:36.647]  And this is going to be used as a form of social control.
[02:54:36.647 --> 02:54:43.329]  So we see with this present government bank merger system that's coming in, that's right on with the agenda.
[02:54:43.329 --> 02:54:49.571]  And the government will eventually be right into your account and they will use it as a tool to control you.
[02:54:49.571 --> 02:54:54.112]  If you've been a bad boy, no more money for a few weeks until you bend a knee.
[02:54:54.878 --> 02:55:00.841]  And this is coming in, and I'm certain this is what's going to come out of this whole globalized monetary system they're bringing in right now.
[02:55:00.841 --> 02:55:02.461]  And again, they create all the crises.
[02:55:02.461 --> 02:55:05.343]  They release the biological agents, then they offer the solution.
[02:55:05.343 --> 02:55:08.184]  They engineer the economic crisis, they offer the solution.
[02:55:08.184 --> 02:55:18.909]  They slip in the Chinese slave goods out of China, and then they say, okay, we passed a law that nobody in America can weave clothes for their children, and we're banning any production in textiles in the U.S.
[02:55:18.909 --> 02:55:21.670]  or anywhere else, unless it's certified by the government.
[02:55:22.130 --> 02:55:23.471]  It is one of their weak points, indeed, yes.
[02:55:49.366 --> 02:55:53.848]  Back in 70 seconds, Alan, let's talk about that and talk about solutions and things we can do to fight this.
[02:55:53.848 --> 02:55:59.469]  And I want to get into chemtrails with you and our carbon footprint, how that's going to be controlled.
[02:55:59.469 --> 02:56:01.850]  And then we'll go to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:01.850 --> 02:56:07.432]  Final hour, straight ahead.
[02:56:07.432 --> 02:56:09.933]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:56:17.358 --> 02:56:20.982]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:56:20.982 --> 02:56:23.104]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:56:23.104 --> 02:56:26.468]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:56:26.468 --> 02:56:28.350]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[02:56:28.900 --> 02:56:29.300]  Let's do it!

[02:57:20.374 --> 02:57:23.135]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:57:33.869 --> 02:57:39.310]  All right, final hour on this final broadcast of this week, first week of the new year.
[02:57:39.310 --> 02:57:42.171]  We're back live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:57:42.171 --> 02:57:46.132]  and of course next week for a few of the days Jason Marmus is here in town.
[02:57:46.132 --> 02:57:50.254]  He'll be sitting in with a lot of important and informative guests coming up.
[02:57:50.254 --> 02:57:50.454]  Now,
[02:57:52.105 --> 02:57:54.829]  I want to go back to Alan Watt.
[02:57:54.829 --> 02:57:58.534]  Alan, we've been having a riveting, informative discussion here.
[02:57:58.534 --> 02:58:00.577]  People that say we're being negative, we're not.
[02:58:00.577 --> 02:58:02.580]  It's like looking out your window and seeing a storm coming in.
[02:58:02.580 --> 02:58:03.942]  Somebody says, what's the weather?
[02:58:03.942 --> 02:58:04.823]  Oh, a storm's coming in.
[02:58:04.823 --> 02:58:05.584]  Oh, don't be negative.
[02:58:08.925 --> 02:58:11.446]  All we're doing is covering the facts here, the reality.
[02:58:11.446 --> 02:58:19.130]  You alluded about 15 minutes ago to the carbon footprint, the allotted amount of creds you'll have on your card.
[02:58:19.130 --> 02:58:20.431]  All of this is admitted.
[02:58:20.431 --> 02:58:25.653]  You know, even if you quote, have wealth, you won't be able to spend it because it'll be past your carbon footprint.
[02:58:25.653 --> 02:58:28.034]  And then of course, that will all be selectively
[02:58:29.375 --> 02:58:30.495]  Selectively enforced.
[02:58:30.495 --> 02:58:35.937]  I mean, this is the total controlled society with the technology to try to carry it out.
[02:58:35.937 --> 02:58:39.558]  So can you speak more about life under the carbon footprint which they're now bringing in?
[02:58:39.558 --> 02:58:43.459]  Obama says you'll have weekly, monthly visits to your farm, your home.
[02:58:43.459 --> 02:58:45.740]  You'll get special permits to do any changes to your house.
[02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:55.826]  Cows, $170 tax, soda, but then all foods, satellite boxes in all your cars, taxing you as you drive.
[02:58:55.826 --> 02:58:57.107]  They're now saying it all.
[02:58:57.107 --> 02:59:03.351]  Everything we warn people about that was in the planning documents we saw decades ago, we're now here.
[02:59:03.351 --> 02:59:14.058]  In this continuum, from the early elites forming and the scientific dictatorship several thousand years ago to now, how far along on that continuum towards what they believe is their endgame are we?
[02:59:14.058 --> 02:59:14.598]  Are we 80% there, 90% there?
[02:59:16.354 --> 02:59:18.697]  I think we're probably 90% there.
[02:59:18.697 --> 02:59:21.079]  That's why it is in the open now.
[02:59:21.079 --> 02:59:22.901]  And they're not really concerned.
[02:59:22.901 --> 02:59:27.246]  They have all of the classes they need.
[02:59:27.246 --> 02:59:30.710]  It's mainly academia on their side.
[02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:34.554]  They fund so many of the big corporations.
[02:59:34.554 --> 02:59:37.337]  Even with the bailouts, the corporations must do as they're told as well.
[02:59:38.078 --> 02:59:39.779]  And go along with this.
[02:59:39.779 --> 02:59:45.720]  Everyone is being paid off, bought off, or simply blackmailed to go along with this whole agenda.
[02:59:45.720 --> 02:59:48.541]  And it's the academia that does it willingly.
[02:59:48.541 --> 02:59:51.442]  So they're not bothered about the general public whatsoever.
[02:59:51.442 --> 03:00:00.084]  In fact, the general public are still watching all the trivia that's doled out to them, as they said they'd do, to keep them happy and entertained.
[03:00:00.084 --> 03:00:02.505]  But you're quite right with this whole carbon thing.
[03:00:03.318 --> 03:00:05.699]  See, man is the problem according to them.
[03:00:05.699 --> 03:00:07.520]  There's too many of us.
[03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:12.942]  And everything that we need or use gives off carbon in the manufacturing.
[03:00:12.942 --> 03:00:16.903]  Even down to creating a house for you to live in is a problem.
[03:00:16.903 --> 03:00:19.844]  And that's another way they're getting people off the land.
[03:00:19.844 --> 03:00:24.646]  They started voluntary programs to come in and test your house from the government.
[03:00:24.646 --> 03:00:27.887]  The government puts so much money towards you, re-insulating it, etc.
[03:00:28.963 --> 03:00:38.166]  And that that scheme was to get us all used to the idea of government coming in and testing our houses to see if they were worthy enough to stand up or be knocked down.
[03:00:38.166 --> 03:00:40.127]  And eventually that will become mandatory.
[03:00:40.127 --> 03:00:48.050]  They want the people off the land, according to Agenda 21, the United Nations program, into these big overcrowded cities.
[03:00:48.050 --> 03:00:50.051]  And that's where they plan to contain us.
[03:00:50.051 --> 03:00:51.051]  That ties right in.
[03:00:51.584 --> 03:00:52.345]  We're good to go.
[03:01:13.055 --> 03:01:15.516]  In other words, they don't intend to maintain those cities.
[03:01:15.516 --> 03:01:25.121]  These have to be simply to contain the public for a period of 30 to 40 years until the public are pretty well all dead and gone.
[03:01:25.121 --> 03:01:34.746]  Now, the whole carbon idea came up from a big think tank that works with all the other big think tanks, well-funded, interconnected with them, and that's the Club of Rome.
[03:01:35.544 --> 03:01:35.845]  I think?
[03:01:50.624 --> 03:01:59.071]  And it's a sick joke because we're a carbon-based light form.
[03:01:59.071 --> 03:02:01.273]  Everything on this planet is carbon-based.
[03:02:01.273 --> 03:02:06.898]  And they're saying it's going to be a toxic waste, but all their genetic engineering, all their toxic waste dumping, that's okay.
[03:02:06.898 --> 03:02:12.943]  It's only carbon dioxide and other gases that come off of life forms, which is all part of the life cycle.
[03:02:12.943 --> 03:02:18.367]  They're waging war on the life cycle itself and saying they're going to micromanage and tax every facet.
[03:02:18.367 --> 03:02:19.148]  The power to tax
[03:02:19.528 --> 03:02:20.550]  Is the power to destroy.
[03:02:20.550 --> 03:02:24.317]  It is a tax on the life-giving gas itself.
[03:02:25.816 --> 03:02:27.477]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:02:27.477 --> 03:02:32.221]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:02:32.221 --> 03:02:35.203]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:02:35.203 --> 03:02:38.245]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:02:38.245 --> 03:02:44.390]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:02:44.390 --> 03:02:49.954]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[03:02:50.154 --> 03:02:51.996]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[03:02:51.996 --> 03:02:55.959]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[03:02:55.959 --> 03:02:58.781]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[03:02:58.781 --> 03:03:07.928]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[03:03:07.928 --> 03:03:15.014]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[03:03:15.014 --> 03:03:17.016]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[03:03:17.236 --> 03:03:19.457]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[03:03:19.457 --> 03:03:25.139]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[03:03:25.139 --> 03:03:28.380]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[03:03:28.380 --> 03:03:31.741]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[03:03:31.741 --> 03:03:33.561]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[03:03:33.561 --> 03:03:37.643]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[03:03:37.643 --> 03:03:40.083]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared.
[03:03:40.083 --> 03:03:41.084]  Get self-sufficient.
[03:03:41.084 --> 03:03:41.504]  Get food.
[03:03:41.764 --> 03:03:49.288]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the New World Order, has a lot less control over you.
[03:03:49.288 --> 03:03:50.489]  And so it's a mindset.
[03:03:50.489 --> 03:03:53.250]  A mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[03:03:53.250 --> 03:03:56.472]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:03:56.472 --> 03:04:03.456]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:04:03.456 --> 03:04:06.538]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:04:06.718 --> 03:04:11.882]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[03:04:11.882 --> 03:04:18.148]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:04:18.148 --> 03:04:21.911]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:04:21.911 --> 03:04:23.192]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:04:23.192 --> 03:04:23.893]  Take action today.
[03:04:23.893 --> 03:04:25.714]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:04:34.099 --> 03:04:36.862]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:04:36.862 --> 03:04:39.746]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:04:39.746 --> 03:04:44.231]  Going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[03:04:44.231 --> 03:04:51.880]  Before I do that I wanted to give Alan a little time to talk about any issues he thinks are most important instead of just my questions and our
[03:04:53.655 --> 03:05:06.948]  Analysis back and forth before we do that I want to tell you who's made this show possible today And these are great products that I fully endorse use and believe in number one is a cola blue A cola blue is just an amazing high quality
[03:05:08.692 --> 03:05:11.114]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[03:05:11.114 --> 03:05:13.857]  Pays for itself with one year if you buy your water from the store.
[03:05:13.857 --> 03:05:15.398]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[03:05:15.398 --> 03:05:17.239]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[03:05:17.239 --> 03:05:20.442]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours.
[03:05:20.442 --> 03:05:20.782]  7.5 gallons.
[03:05:20.782 --> 03:05:21.963]  That's their smaller unit.
[03:05:21.963 --> 03:05:23.245]  Great tasting pure H2O.
[03:05:23.245 --> 03:05:24.566]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:05:24.566 --> 03:05:26.447]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[03:05:26.447 --> 03:05:27.668]  Neutral pH.
[03:05:27.668 --> 03:05:34.554]  Then it goes through an activated carbon filter, then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, and a taste and food
[03:05:35.515 --> 03:05:36.175]  We're good to go.
[03:06:02.205 --> 03:06:09.992]  Is eFoodsDirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group, the highest quality storable foods for the price out there, no GMO foods.
[03:06:09.992 --> 03:06:15.857]  A lot of videos, free videos you can watch or audios you can listen to at the website, eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:06:18.590 --> 03:06:21.774]  And you need to give them a call, because self-sufficiency is the key.
[03:06:21.774 --> 03:06:33.648]  And if you're buying seeds, moving to the country, gearing up to be self-sufficient, moving out of the cities, which I think is advisable for those that can, to face what's coming, you may not even have time.
[03:06:34.949 --> 03:06:43.375]  This is something you can have now that you know is a backup, lasts more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years in non-climate control.
[03:06:43.375 --> 03:06:44.696]  efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:44.696 --> 03:06:51.000]  The letter E, foodsdirect.com, or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:52.581]  Again, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:52.581 --> 03:06:55.984]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:06:55.984 --> 03:06:59.686]  Okay, Alan Watt, you want to continue with Carbon Footprint?
[03:07:01.087 --> 03:07:04.750]  Finishing what you were trying to say before we got cut off by break.
[03:07:04.750 --> 03:07:06.692]  And then the chemtrails overall.
[03:07:06.692 --> 03:07:10.175]  I'm looking at satellite photos on the major weather sites.
[03:07:10.175 --> 03:07:12.237]  I'm looking at the whole world now.
[03:07:12.237 --> 03:07:15.100]  And I've gone back, because they have archives, as you know, but the listeners may not.
[03:07:16.028 --> 03:07:20.009]  of the skies five, ten, fifteen years ago, it wasn't there.
[03:07:20.009 --> 03:07:30.773]  Now, not just the major cities, like five years ago, but all over the U.S., all over Europe, all over Australia, but even some in third world countries, but it's mainly in the West.
[03:07:30.773 --> 03:07:32.954]  It's just covered with the trails.
[03:07:32.954 --> 03:07:35.054]  They're now at a couple thousand feet in Austin.
[03:07:35.054 --> 03:07:37.155]  They stay there for hour after hour.
[03:07:37.155 --> 03:07:38.296]  Everybody's getting sick.
[03:07:38.296 --> 03:07:44.658]  Major news media has been testing it and finding barium salts, weird fibers.
[03:07:47.059 --> 03:08:02.309]  Yes, back to the footprints, the carbon ones, they're adding taxes on to air flights now too, because the future you see, they're going to ban basically tourism.
[03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:03.930]  That will be no longer necessary.
[03:08:04.998 --> 03:08:11.046]  You won't be able to travel to any country without it being required for business or work-related.
[03:08:11.046 --> 03:08:12.908]  That's the system they're bringing in.
[03:08:12.908 --> 03:08:16.753]  And that'll all be selectively enforced when you go travel places you see.
[03:08:16.753 --> 03:08:19.977]  I'll never forget, and I'm gonna let you continue, but just bring up points.
[03:08:19.977 --> 03:08:22.100]  About 15 years ago, before I was even on air,
[03:08:23.203 --> 03:08:39.553]  I was out at Hamilton Pool, this cenote, this caved in underground cave, you know, beautiful, looks like something out of Tarzan, deep water, big snapping turtles and fish, and I was playing hooky from college, and I was there with a girlfriend laying out on the pebbles, you know, on a summer day, and
[03:08:40.393 --> 03:08:47.158]  These Nature Conservancy people showed up and they were making eugenics comments and going, I can't believe they allow people even here.
[03:08:47.158 --> 03:08:49.139]  I can't believe they even allow humans here.
[03:08:49.139 --> 03:08:51.981]  And they were just looking at us with anger.
[03:08:51.981 --> 03:08:58.865]  And then suddenly you saw the park rangers acting like that and this whole culture that we've got to be controlled and herded into cities.
[03:08:58.865 --> 03:09:06.831]  So I just wanted to add that point that we're not even under the official UN plans going to be allowed in more than half of the United States on their maps alone.
[03:09:06.831 --> 03:09:08.392]  You will be shot if you enter it.
[03:09:08.392 --> 03:09:09.472]  And people didn't believe me.
[03:09:09.472 --> 03:09:09.833]  And then
[03:09:10.633 --> 03:09:12.494]  In 1999, I'll never forget.
[03:09:12.494 --> 03:09:13.575]  I don't remember the exact issue.
[03:09:13.575 --> 03:09:17.538]  I showed it on my local TV show many times and covered it on air for like a month.
[03:09:17.538 --> 03:09:20.600]  It was talking about an area in Asia.
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:22.061]  I want to say Burma.
[03:09:22.061 --> 03:09:28.285]  And it said huge national, international biosphere, UN World Heritage sites.
[03:09:28.285 --> 03:09:38.252]  Hundreds of thousands of acres were off limits and it showed soldiers with M16s and it said if the locals try to enter to even get water or even get fire water, they are shot.
[03:09:38.252 --> 03:09:39.813]  And so that model is already going.
[03:09:39.813 --> 03:09:40.113]  Go ahead.
[03:09:41.013 --> 03:09:57.521]  That's true, and getting back to the housing, they will be coming around the houses and testing it for leakage, because if you can't heat your house efficiently and contain the heat and use bare metal fuel, etc., they're basically going to kick you out of that home.
[03:09:57.521 --> 03:10:03.543]  Banning fireplaces, banning space heaters already in Europe, moving to do that in Canada, it just goes on and on.
[03:10:03.543 --> 03:10:04.924]  Yes, so that's the whole agenda.
[03:10:04.924 --> 03:10:09.206]  So through the force of law and using the power of the purse, as I call it,
[03:10:10.064 --> 03:10:12.445]  They would force this whole agenda through.
[03:10:12.445 --> 03:10:20.548]  Cars, airplanes, farms, ranches, space heaters, homes, food, every facet, micromanage and text.
[03:10:20.548 --> 03:10:21.988]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:10:21.988 --> 03:10:30.051]  That's the big stick, and people who have been trained from birth, they always go along with laws, always go along with laws, and don't question it.
[03:10:30.051 --> 03:10:32.532]  Everyone else goes along with the law, so why can't you?
[03:10:32.532 --> 03:10:34.413]  That's what they say to you if you object.
[03:10:34.758 --> 03:10:36.418]  Well, take the Animal ID.
[03:10:36.418 --> 03:10:37.499]  Take the Animal ID.
[03:10:37.499 --> 03:10:39.939]  I mean, it's just so incredible.
[03:10:39.939 --> 03:10:41.540]  They just mail them around to people.
[03:10:41.540 --> 03:10:43.980]  It wasn't even a law, except in two states, federal.
[03:10:43.980 --> 03:10:46.521]  And they just say, fill out this contract and sign it.
[03:10:46.521 --> 03:10:51.923]  They sign away their farm and ranch, and now they're finding out they just gave the government an easement and control.
[03:10:51.923 --> 03:10:53.083]  That's correct.
[03:10:53.083 --> 03:10:57.224]  So, what we're up against here is such incredible organization.
[03:10:57.224 --> 03:11:01.225]  That's what really hits anyone who goes into this field of study and research.
[03:11:02.168 --> 03:11:14.477]  The incredible organization that's micromanaged right down to the lowest level on every particular area or facet of living, that's what strikes you as overwhelming.
[03:11:14.477 --> 03:11:21.421]  And it isn't until you realize this has been on the go for such a long time that explains why they're all interconnected.
[03:11:21.421 --> 03:11:29.247]  When Margaret Thatcher left as the Prime Minister of Britain, she said that she now belonged to the parallel government.
[03:11:29.247 --> 03:11:30.628]  She called it the parallel government
[03:11:31.428 --> 03:11:36.098]  It's made up of ex-prime ministers, presidents and high officials of all countries.
[03:11:36.098 --> 03:11:37.542]  She says we really run the show.
[03:11:38.667 --> 03:11:46.915]  And I just noticed today that Tony Blair and Merkel is over there with Sarkozy talking about this new economic system they're bringing in.
[03:11:46.915 --> 03:11:56.284]  So Tony Blair, even though he's an ex-Prime Minister, is doing more behind the scenes than he could possibly do when he was the front man as the Prime Minister.
[03:11:56.284 --> 03:11:57.865]  He belongs to the parallel government.
[03:11:57.865 --> 03:12:01.369]  He's now graduated to the real government.
[03:12:01.369 --> 03:12:01.549]  Yes.
[03:12:01.869 --> 03:12:07.471]  Which itself takes orders, while the public's focused on the front dummy puppets.
[03:12:07.471 --> 03:12:11.172]  And I meant to get to that story, it's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[03:12:11.172 --> 03:12:19.955]  They're saying a new capitalism, with what you said 30 minutes ago, where the government pays all the corporations, who in turn pay the people, total control.
[03:12:19.955 --> 03:12:20.475]  That's correct.
[03:12:20.475 --> 03:12:24.416]  So therefore government will achieve the objective it was set up to do a long time ago.
[03:12:25.256 --> 03:12:26.017]  Finland's been doing that!
[03:12:40.776 --> 03:12:50.887]  And Finland's been doing that for 16, 17 years, where your parking ticket is according to how much money you have, and if you're wealthy or they take more, it's a class thing they did to sell the public.
[03:12:50.887 --> 03:13:01.818]  But now it's for carbon footprint, and everything you buy and sell is tracked, and they compare that, and they say it's the world model according to how much money you make, so they can tell if you're not paying taxes or have a black market job.
[03:13:01.818 --> 03:13:02.258]  That's correct.
[03:13:03.024 --> 03:13:03.184]  Oh!
[03:13:03.184 --> 03:13:03.524]  Oh, a Masonic?
[03:13:18.571 --> 03:13:28.736]  They will know if all that you have, food wise, comes from your ration, your quota, and if you're above that, they'll want to know where you got it from.
[03:13:28.736 --> 03:13:43.384]  Yes, it reads the RFID, and by law they're trying to make it where all refrigerators will have this within five years, and then now this big masonic hospital organization, I saw the story two weeks ago, where the old people, if they aren't eating enough food, or it's scanning their food, they go ahead and come and
[03:13:43.684 --> 03:13:43.984]  That's right.
[03:13:43.984 --> 03:13:49.986]  And getting back to this parallel government, I mean, Professor Carl Quigley talked about this in his book, Tragedy and Hope and the Anglo-American Establishment, two books.
[03:14:10.225 --> 03:14:13.527]  He said that the parallel government runs with technocrats.
[03:14:13.527 --> 03:14:19.252]  Now, Blair now is a technocrat like Brzezinski, or Maurice Strong, or Kissinger.
[03:14:19.252 --> 03:14:31.981]  And he said that the prime ministers and presidents can take the heat for the policies of government, he says, but the real work is done behind the scenes with technocrats who are not responsible to the public, they're not elected by the public.
[03:14:31.981 --> 03:14:38.346]  His whole life, Blair's whole life, Clinton's whole life, they finally graduate into real government.
[03:14:38.346 --> 03:14:38.506]  Yes.
[03:14:39.838 --> 03:14:48.005]  And we're seeing it now, and I mean, why is the media even so concentrated on ex-Prime Ministers and ex-Presidents?
[03:14:48.005 --> 03:15:04.120]  It's out in the open now that they are a part of this important parallel government that's interlinked, interwoven completely with all of the big foundations that all work in concert, they're all on the same agenda, and they even have foundations which go out to make sure there's consensus.
[03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:13.629]  Building within every organization, so they're all on board on track with the same politically correct agendas.
[03:15:13.629 --> 03:15:15.311]  Simply stunning, Alan Watt.
[03:15:15.311 --> 03:15:18.214]  Briefly, chemtrails, they seem to be intensifying.
[03:15:18.214 --> 03:15:21.217]  They are intensifying.
[03:15:21.217 --> 03:15:28.224]  I noticed it in Ontario when they really started hitting us, ten years ago exactly in fact it was,
[03:15:29.113 --> 03:15:29.273]  I don't
[03:15:51.061 --> 03:15:58.528]  It's only now they're saying we're thinking of seeding the air with chemicals to curb global warming.
[03:15:58.528 --> 03:16:03.152]  Well, they've been doing something for 10 years, and I don't think it's got anything to do with global warming.
[03:16:03.152 --> 03:16:11.459]  In fact, those who watch this notice that when they heavily spray an area, it heats up underneath because the tiny refractors in the metals act like mirrors.
[03:16:11.459 --> 03:16:12.420]  Now they're trying to heat.
[03:16:12.420 --> 03:16:13.201]  They're trying to heat.
[03:16:13.641 --> 03:16:19.444]  And I think that because I think they knew the sun was about to cool off and I'm not saying they're good, but they actually need to heat the earth.
[03:16:19.444 --> 03:16:21.665]  Then they're trying to restrict carbon.
[03:16:21.665 --> 03:16:24.207]  Alan Watt, let's finish up with Kim Trails, then go right to calls.
[03:16:24.207 --> 03:16:28.149]  Michael, Joe, Bill, Mark, Michelle, Michael, Danny and others.
[03:16:28.149 --> 03:16:28.809]  Stay with us.
[03:16:28.809 --> 03:16:33.672]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:33.672 --> 03:16:40.656]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[03:16:41.459 --> 03:16:42.719]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:16:42.719 --> 03:16:49.742]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:16:49.742 --> 03:16:58.265]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:16:58.649 --> 03:17:05.754]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:17:05.754 --> 03:17:08.916]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:17:08.916 --> 03:17:14.680]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:17:14.680 --> 03:17:17.762]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:17:17.762 --> 03:17:24.266]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the
[03:17:27.551 --> 03:17:30.714]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[03:17:37.546 --> 03:17:43.431]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[03:17:43.431 --> 03:17:44.552]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[03:17:44.552 --> 03:17:49.256]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:17:49.256 --> 03:18:02.507]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[03:18:03.047 --> 03:18:08.650]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[03:18:08.650 --> 03:18:15.293]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[03:18:15.293 --> 03:18:18.155]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:18:18.155 --> 03:18:21.756]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[03:18:21.756 --> 03:18:22.397]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:18:22.397 --> 03:18:24.578]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[03:18:24.578 --> 03:18:24.638]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:18:32.810 --> 03:18:38.658]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[03:18:38.658 --> 03:18:48.532]  The original Can-C eyedrop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataract.
[03:18:48.652 --> 03:18:53.134]  CanSee can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[03:18:53.134 --> 03:19:00.217]  CanSee is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, can ease computer vision syndrome, and more.
[03:19:00.217 --> 03:19:05.879]  People enjoying the benefits while using CanSee report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burn.
[03:19:05.879 --> 03:19:06.179]  I think so.
[03:19:34.690 --> 03:19:40.455]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[03:19:40.455 --> 03:19:42.737]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[03:19:42.737 --> 03:19:44.859]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[03:19:44.859 --> 03:19:48.863]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[03:19:48.863 --> 03:19:52.867]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[03:19:52.867 --> 03:19:58.592]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies.
[03:20:03.123 --> 03:20:05.745]  Great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[03:20:05.745 --> 03:20:14.391]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival spy and tactical gear.

[03:20:36.975 --> 03:20:44.837]  I don't know how anybody out there watching couldn't visit InfoWars.com or PrisonWanda.com five, six times a day and spread the word.
[03:20:44.837 --> 03:20:52.500]  I mean the stories here, Obama's Energy Czar, Socialist Agent for a New World Order, Air Force Creates Counterblog, Response to Plan
[03:20:53.300 --> 03:20:54.181]  We're good to go.
[03:21:13.055 --> 03:21:29.763]  It is just unbelievable the type of things, and things are going so fast now Alan, you and I can hardly even respond to all of it, and everything we said is happening because we were just reading the Globalist's own documents before they were widely disseminated.
[03:21:29.763 --> 03:21:32.144]  Yes, that's the whole trick of it.
[03:21:32.144 --> 03:21:37.647]  The public have been unfortunately well trained with scientific indoctrination.
[03:21:38.157 --> 03:21:41.358]  The television is not something to be entertained with.
[03:21:41.358 --> 03:21:43.919]  It's the greatest tool the elite have ever had.
[03:21:43.919 --> 03:21:57.305]  You can't listen to truth and think about the truth and dissect it for yourself and switch on the TV and get lost for an hour on some other topic because whatever you're learning is going to be eradicated from your mind.
[03:21:57.305 --> 03:21:59.186]  It is a scientific tool.
[03:21:59.186 --> 03:22:01.367]  It's been put to an incredible effect.
[03:22:01.909 --> 03:22:11.479]  But they're also going into the ELF warfare techniques now that Brzezinski talked about in his book Between Two Ages.
[03:22:11.479 --> 03:22:21.789]  He mentioned the Technotronic Era in that book, and the Technotronic Era was a technique that would be used on the general population.
[03:22:21.789 --> 03:22:23.571]  He meant worldwide, where
[03:22:24.625 --> 03:22:29.446]  They get their opinions and ideas coming to them, but they have no idea where it was coming from.
[03:22:29.446 --> 03:22:32.547]  And he was talking about really ELF technology.
[03:22:32.547 --> 03:22:36.048]  And they are putting up antennas in some of the big cities.
[03:22:36.048 --> 03:22:41.310]  I've got photographs here, some of them in the process of being built, in fact.
[03:22:41.310 --> 03:22:45.571]  And they have their own transponders down below.
[03:22:47.208 --> 03:22:55.597]  And these things are unlike the ones they use for cell phones, and I think this is all part of the network to control the minds of the public.
[03:22:55.597 --> 03:22:57.499]  Now, this stuff is well proven.
[03:22:57.499 --> 03:22:58.940]  It works very well.
[03:22:58.940 --> 03:23:00.582]  It can put you into a state of apathy.
[03:23:02.003 --> 03:23:06.627]  Or aggression, or depression, or aggression very easily.
[03:23:06.627 --> 03:23:19.416]  By the way, a mainstream publication two weeks ago came out, and it's been in the Baltimore Sun as well, and said DARPA has these, ultrasound alone can calm you or make you angry, and they said we're going to start doing this for the public.
[03:23:19.416 --> 03:23:19.876]  That's right.
[03:23:19.876 --> 03:23:24.579]  We're just going to put towers up, but it's to fight Al Qaeda, Alan.
[03:23:24.579 --> 03:23:28.122]  Yes, they're actually going ahead and building them and putting them up.
[03:23:28.886 --> 03:23:32.728]  In preparedness for the times ahead.
[03:23:32.728 --> 03:23:37.410]  Well, Alan, what are we going to do when a cop shoots an unarmed man in the back on the ground?
[03:23:37.410 --> 03:23:40.571]  We've got to turn these on and calm everybody down, Alan.
[03:23:40.571 --> 03:23:42.672]  Yes, that's the whole thing.
[03:23:42.672 --> 03:23:48.074]  You see, again, it goes back to this whole idea that we're just animals and there's nothing spiritual about you.
[03:23:48.074 --> 03:23:49.695]  You have no soul, no nothing.
[03:23:49.695 --> 03:23:52.696]  You're just a contained brain.
[03:23:52.696 --> 03:23:54.897]  And they call it endless loops inside your own brain.
[03:23:54.897 --> 03:23:56.498]  That's what they teach in university.
[03:23:56.798 --> 03:23:58.238]  And they also give us double-think.
[03:23:58.238 --> 03:24:02.260]  They go, well, all these people die when they get tasered, but that's just a syndrome.
[03:24:02.260 --> 03:24:04.380]  People just happen to die at the same time they're tasered.
[03:24:04.380 --> 03:24:05.220]  It's not the taser.
[03:24:05.220 --> 03:24:10.622]  Some people are allergic to it, you see.
[03:24:10.622 --> 03:24:12.983]  Well, now when we shoot you, maybe it's a syndrome.
[03:24:12.983 --> 03:24:14.083]  Maybe the bullet didn't do it.
[03:24:14.844 --> 03:24:15.304]  That's it.
[03:24:15.304 --> 03:24:16.305]  That's right.
[03:24:16.305 --> 03:24:18.287]  And so they can rationalize, and they are.
[03:24:18.287 --> 03:24:26.296]  They're using every kind of rationalization, almost mockingly today, to justify what they can do because they're given all power.
[03:24:26.296 --> 03:24:28.398]  They know they have all power to do as they wish.
[03:24:29.011 --> 03:24:35.676]  They've raised a generation that's willing to use all of this technology and weaponry on the public.
[03:24:35.676 --> 03:24:38.038]  They've been brought up playing the video games.
[03:24:38.038 --> 03:24:39.640]  There's no morality in a video game.
[03:24:39.640 --> 03:24:40.921]  It's get to the other side and kill everybody.
[03:24:40.921 --> 03:24:45.244]  And they condition us with all the violence they constantly show on TV to accept it.
[03:24:45.244 --> 03:24:46.445]  This segment's almost over.
[03:24:46.445 --> 03:24:48.167]  I want to come back and go directly to calls.
[03:24:48.167 --> 03:24:51.069]  You got cut off on the last segment with the Chemtrails comments.
[03:24:51.069 --> 03:24:52.370]  Go ahead.
[03:24:52.370 --> 03:24:58.415]  Yes, the Chemtrails, I'll tell you, it probably has many, many different functions, I'm sure.
[03:24:59.409 --> 03:25:02.375]  It definitely makes people apathetic and tired.
[03:25:02.375 --> 03:25:03.877]  That's been well noted.
[03:25:03.877 --> 03:25:09.789]  And I get, I've been watching this for years and talking to hundreds of people over the years on it, but they're heavily sprayed.
[03:25:10.601 --> 03:25:18.984]  And as you say, the follow-up, the physical fallouts, even in the bronchial tubes and the long-lasting infections, etc., are well noted.
[03:25:18.984 --> 03:25:23.045]  Every pharmacist in the country knows what his best-selling products are.
[03:25:23.045 --> 03:25:34.348]  Go in and ask the pharmacist and he'll tell you it's the bronchodilators and expectorants and so on, and antibiotics that are really being pushed for the last 10 years to do with this spraying.
[03:25:34.348 --> 03:25:36.409]  He might not mention the spraying, he might not know himself,
[03:25:36.969 --> 03:25:39.270]  But he knows what he sells off the shelves.
[03:25:39.270 --> 03:25:44.672]  And so the ones at the top who advocated this, they treat us like children.
[03:25:44.672 --> 03:25:45.613]  They call us children.
[03:25:45.613 --> 03:25:47.873]  You cannot tell the children what we're doing to them.
[03:25:47.873 --> 03:25:48.994]  It's for their own benefit.
[03:25:48.994 --> 03:25:49.974]  Poor souls.
[03:25:49.974 --> 03:25:51.395]  But we don't want to scare them.
[03:25:51.395 --> 03:25:58.918]  They know, probably right down to the smallest iota, how many people will die off with this, with respiratory problems.
[03:26:01.052 --> 03:26:02.653]  And then we call it allergies.
[03:26:02.653 --> 03:26:04.393]  People who never had them suddenly can't breathe.
[03:26:04.393 --> 03:26:05.854]  They're sick all the time.
[03:26:05.854 --> 03:26:12.077]  Suddenly, I saw a report last year that women's lung cancer is up seven times what it was a decade ago.
[03:26:12.077 --> 03:26:13.657]  And they go, that's all right.
[03:26:13.657 --> 03:26:17.939]  We'll have a little cancer group for you and make you feel like you're a little movie star.
[03:26:17.939 --> 03:26:19.880]  Now you're going to die and go in a coffin.
[03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:21.040]  Bye bye.
[03:26:21.040 --> 03:26:21.740]  We love you.
[03:26:21.740 --> 03:26:23.401]  We'll be right back.
[03:26:23.401 --> 03:26:24.802]  We're on the march.
[03:26:24.802 --> 03:26:27.323]  The empire's on the run.
[03:26:27.323 --> 03:26:30.024]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:26:33.675 --> 03:26:35.476]  The headlines are clear.
[03:26:35.476 --> 03:26:38.398]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[03:26:38.398 --> 03:26:41.601]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[03:26:41.601 --> 03:26:43.362]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[03:26:43.362 --> 03:26:46.664]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[03:26:46.664 --> 03:26:49.426]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[03:26:49.426 --> 03:26:50.326]  To stay free.
[03:26:51.327 --> 03:26:54.990]  Now, Survivalist Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[03:26:54.990 --> 03:26:58.372]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[03:26:58.372 --> 03:27:01.234]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[03:27:01.234 --> 03:27:04.936]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[03:27:04.936 --> 03:27:08.979]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[03:27:08.979 --> 03:27:19.666]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him, restaurants, and small delis.
[03:27:19.666 --> 03:27:20.887]  Don't buy from copycats.
[03:27:21.067 --> 03:27:26.413]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:27:26.413 --> 03:27:28.616]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:27:42.512 --> 03:27:44.053]  But who is the enemy?
[03:27:44.053 --> 03:27:44.854]  Bin Laden.
[03:27:44.854 --> 03:27:45.855]  This is his M.O.
[03:27:45.855 --> 03:27:47.216]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:27:47.216 --> 03:27:49.217]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:27:49.217 --> 03:27:56.362]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:27:56.362 --> 03:27:56.863]  Some U.S.
[03:27:56.863 --> 03:28:02.527]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:28:03.187 --> 03:28:06.709]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:28:06.709 --> 03:28:09.491]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:28:32.961 --> 03:28:38.003]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system new from HempUSA.org.
[03:28:38.003 --> 03:28:46.606]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[03:28:46.606 --> 03:28:51.528]  Imagine a softer smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[03:28:51.528 --> 03:28:58.330]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[03:28:58.590 --> 03:29:04.994]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[03:29:04.994 --> 03:29:20.745]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins, with extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables, and fruits, improve taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[03:29:20.925 --> 03:29:24.686]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[03:29:24.686 --> 03:29:28.447]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[03:29:28.447 --> 03:29:31.108]  That's 908-691-2608.
[03:29:31.108 --> 03:29:40.151]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:40.151 --> 03:29:42.452]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:29:54.322 --> 03:29:54.603]  Yeah.
[03:29:56.440 --> 03:29:57.681]  All right, Alan.
[03:29:57.681 --> 03:29:59.701]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com is his website.
[03:29:59.701 --> 03:30:04.363]  Be sure and check out the audios, the materials, the videos, things that are available there.
[03:30:04.363 --> 03:30:06.864]  Be sure and support Alan Watt and the work he's doing.
[03:30:06.864 --> 03:30:11.766]  Be sure and support our work as well and all the documentary films that I have made.
[03:30:11.766 --> 03:30:13.947]  I've made 20 of them and produced another.
[03:30:13.947 --> 03:30:16.388]  Actually produced two, Fabled Enemies and Loose Change.
[03:30:16.388 --> 03:30:16.948]  Final Cut.
[03:30:16.948 --> 03:30:21.230]  Fabled Enemies is the latest 9-11 film and we learn more as time goes on.
[03:30:21.230 --> 03:30:25.452]  This is an open and shut case about how the establishment carried out the attacks.
[03:30:26.112 --> 03:30:32.754]  The Money Masters, How the Bankers Got Total Control, three and a half hour film, 1995.
[03:30:32.754 --> 03:30:36.135]  Really the Rosetta Stone of understanding the overall in-game agenda.
[03:30:36.135 --> 03:30:44.378]  If I had to say see one film to understand their total agenda and their program, it's this film, In-Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:30:45.489 --> 03:30:47.791]  The 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising.
[03:30:47.791 --> 03:30:50.514]  I mean, this is the latest film I made.
[03:30:50.514 --> 03:30:52.456]  And I just can't even describe the film.
[03:30:52.456 --> 03:30:54.659]  You've got to see it.
[03:30:54.659 --> 03:30:55.580]  It's cinema verite.
[03:30:55.580 --> 03:30:56.521]  It's fast-paced.
[03:30:56.521 --> 03:31:01.286]  30, 40 world leaders confronted.
[03:31:01.286 --> 03:31:05.270]  Willie Nelson interviewed.
[03:31:05.270 --> 03:31:06.631]  Martin Sheen interviewed.
[03:31:06.631 --> 03:31:07.672]  George
[03:31:09.741 --> 03:31:10.721]  Carlin interviewed.
[03:31:10.721 --> 03:31:15.903]  I mean, the list just goes on and on to try to describe everything that is in this film.
[03:31:15.903 --> 03:31:20.944]  Bill Clinton confronted, David Rockefeller confronted, John McCain, Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[03:31:20.944 --> 03:31:22.144]  Just an incredible film.
[03:31:22.144 --> 03:31:26.765]  The 9-11 Chronicles folks need to have this documentary.
[03:31:26.765 --> 03:31:34.167]  Again, available at InfoWars.com and Alan's stuff's all available at CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[03:31:34.167 --> 03:31:35.267]  I want to go to your calls now.
[03:31:35.267 --> 03:31:37.228]  For those that have been patiently holding for the balance
[03:31:38.516 --> 03:31:41.958]  of this Friday edition and try to move quickly through them.
[03:31:41.958 --> 03:31:44.580]  I appreciate everybody being patient.
[03:31:44.580 --> 03:31:46.561]  Let's talk to Michael in Chicago.
[03:31:46.561 --> 03:31:50.523]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[03:31:50.523 --> 03:31:52.384]  Michelle, excuse me, I read that wrong.
[03:31:52.384 --> 03:31:54.706]  Michelle in Chicago, go ahead.
[03:31:54.706 --> 03:31:56.307]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[03:31:56.307 --> 03:31:57.167]  Good.
[03:31:57.167 --> 03:31:58.368]  I'm a first-time caller.
[03:31:58.368 --> 03:32:03.911]  I probably woke up maybe about two years ago, started watching the 9-11 films and
[03:32:05.666 --> 03:32:33.449]  Um, I was a big watcher of TV before and now that I'm seeing it after waking up to everything that's going on, it's so obvious, the brainwashing that these people are broadcasting to everybody and it's just so disheartening to watch it happen and listen to them mock truthers as conspiracy theorists and just dismiss everything that they're saying and
[03:32:35.089 --> 03:32:44.104]  Make it into a big joke and it's such a ridiculous thing that people, the media is so ridiculous that people just don't pay attention to it.
[03:32:44.847 --> 03:32:47.328]  And they're apathetic, and they just don't care.
[03:32:47.328 --> 03:32:49.168]  But that's what they mean.
[03:32:49.168 --> 03:32:55.089]  At a certain level of programming, that's why they came out and said that the number two in Al-Qaeda had been killed 14 separate times.
[03:32:55.089 --> 03:32:55.770]  Oh my God!
[03:32:55.770 --> 03:32:57.870]  They don't pay attention!
[03:32:57.870 --> 03:32:59.870]  And then never retracted.
[03:32:59.870 --> 03:33:02.791]  Okay, well last time we didn't really kill him, but this time we did.
[03:33:02.791 --> 03:33:04.391]  People don't even care.
[03:33:04.391 --> 03:33:06.632]  They don't even remember what happened two years ago.
[03:33:06.952 --> 03:33:09.953]  All they care about is the current stats that are going on right now.
[03:33:09.953 --> 03:33:14.115]  All these election things, they don't talk about the issues, they talk about the numbers.
[03:33:14.115 --> 03:33:16.376]  Yes, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:33:16.376 --> 03:33:19.578]  No, no, no, I'm just, I want to get Alan's take on this.
[03:33:19.578 --> 03:33:30.243]  I've just noticed they do this, they're making the propaganda ridiculous to make people almost tune out and then just disregard all information where it's all just kind of a background noise.
[03:33:30.243 --> 03:33:33.164]  Alan, what do you call that tactic?
[03:33:33.164 --> 03:33:35.525]  It works with dystopia, they call it.
[03:33:36.280 --> 03:33:36.940]  Thank you very much.
[03:33:53.888 --> 03:34:06.434]  Yeah, they did that with rats and then higher primates and I had a marine call in, I was familiar with a study where they take a puppy and shock it on a plate and it's got its food, every time it goes to the food it shocks it and finally it just rolls over and waits to die.
[03:34:06.434 --> 03:34:14.899]  Yeah, so whenever it mentions the same topic again, you'll just automatically say, well, you're paranoid, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:34:14.899 --> 03:34:19.081]  And abelia is a main one too, it's just no memory, people have no memory.
[03:34:19.745 --> 03:34:23.930]  And they think in bits and bytes, little clips on the media come in short bursts now.
[03:34:23.930 --> 03:34:25.752]  And that's the attention span of most people.
[03:34:25.752 --> 03:34:26.773]  They can't concentrate.
[03:34:26.773 --> 03:34:28.115]  They produced it by design.
[03:34:28.115 --> 03:34:29.176]  Anything else, Michelle?
[03:34:29.176 --> 03:34:33.721]  Um, well, I just wanted to say thank you, Alex.
[03:34:33.721 --> 03:34:36.965]  You've got... You're very brave, to say the least.
[03:34:38.555 --> 03:34:40.736]  Listen, this is not a figure of speech, Michelle.
[03:34:40.736 --> 03:34:42.757]  I'm not, oh, I'm not brave now, ma'am.
[03:34:42.757 --> 03:34:44.178]  I'm just doing my job.
[03:34:44.178 --> 03:34:45.439]  Literally, I'm not brave.
[03:34:45.439 --> 03:34:54.165]  How would I not discover a scientific technocracy that is completely psychopathic and enjoys destroying my species and my children's future?
[03:34:54.165 --> 03:35:01.209]  How would I not aggressively fight it with everything I've got and try to build some media system to at least counter it?
[03:35:01.209 --> 03:35:02.190]  I mean, how would I?
[03:35:02.190 --> 03:35:06.993]  I would be mindlessly brave if I knew this and just said, forget it.
[03:35:07.393 --> 03:35:09.594]  Alan, can you speak to that?
[03:35:09.594 --> 03:35:10.094]  It's true.
[03:35:10.094 --> 03:35:15.737]  I mean, every animal on the planet, even insects, will try and defend themselves.
[03:35:15.737 --> 03:35:21.680]  A mouse will actually scratch the nose of a cat, rather than just get eaten, or to save its young.
[03:35:21.680 --> 03:35:27.163]  And we have the same abilities here, only we've been so dumbed down and made to be apathetic.
[03:35:27.163 --> 03:35:32.146]  This is, again, a scientific technique of indoctrination, of obeyance to authority.
[03:35:32.774 --> 03:35:38.295]  That we allow them to take the next step and the next step to our own extinction.
[03:35:38.295 --> 03:35:40.316]  And we can't allow that to happen.
[03:35:40.316 --> 03:35:41.536]  We can't allow it to happen.
[03:35:41.536 --> 03:35:47.198]  We have the right to exist on this planet as much as anyone who believes he's an elitist does.
[03:35:47.198 --> 03:35:50.699]  And they're no more valued than we are.
[03:35:50.699 --> 03:35:51.799]  That's a fact.
[03:35:51.799 --> 03:35:53.820]  And I appreciate your call, Michel.
[03:35:53.820 --> 03:35:54.800]  I'd love to keep you on longer.
[03:35:54.800 --> 03:35:55.680]  I love all these callers.
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:35:57.321]  We've got to get to everybody who at least is holding.
[03:35:59.261 --> 03:36:04.942]  I mean, that is the basic facts of this, what Alan just said.
[03:36:04.942 --> 03:36:09.083]  And they have taught us to not have our survival instinct or to turn it on and off.
[03:36:09.083 --> 03:36:12.483]  When they say turn it off, it's not okay to stand up and fight back.
[03:36:12.483 --> 03:36:17.364]  Like in England where they arrest you, if somebody's raping your wife and you punch them, you go to jail, the rapist doesn't.
[03:36:17.364 --> 03:36:18.044]  That's on record.
[03:36:18.044 --> 03:36:23.065]  Or if somebody's robbed you three times, they come in to kill you, you stab them, you go to jail.
[03:36:23.065 --> 03:36:26.086]  Or if you push somebody out a window and they're attacking you, you go to jail.
[03:36:26.086 --> 03:36:27.386]  They're saying you are not
[03:36:28.513 --> 03:36:32.519]  To protect yourself because it's a criminal class running things they want.
[03:36:32.519 --> 03:36:43.236]  I mean, it's kind of like when some really expensive snakes, they amputate the guinea pig's legs and defang it and take its teeth out so it can't bite the snake.
[03:36:43.917 --> 03:36:52.040]  When the snake eats it because they don't want the snake to be hurt, or they'll drug the guinea pig with a drug that doesn't affect the snake so the guinea pig doesn't hurt it.
[03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:54.360]  We've been neutralized to be like a guinea pig.
[03:36:54.360 --> 03:37:01.863]  It's had its eyes gouged out, its teeth pulled out, its legs cut off, dropped into the snake, and that's what this social Darwinism is.
[03:37:02.683 --> 03:37:05.705]  And that's what carbon taxing is, teaching us we're bad.
[03:37:05.705 --> 03:37:10.868]  They take our own survival instinct and say, if the Earth's going to survive, we've got to kill ourselves.
[03:37:10.868 --> 03:37:13.529]  They're teaching us our own survival system.
[03:37:13.529 --> 03:37:17.892]  Our own survival propulsion system is a thought crime.
[03:37:17.892 --> 03:37:25.056]  They are, and I was reading an article recently from the United Nations about the idea of power and total power.
[03:37:25.828 --> 03:37:28.149]  And they call that the power monopoly of force.
[03:37:54.126 --> 03:38:00.971]  That's in a UNIDIR document, July 7, 2001, where they say that's why the American people must be armed.
[03:38:00.971 --> 03:38:03.473]  And the bill has been introduced by the Democrats.
[03:38:03.473 --> 03:38:11.198]  Barack Obama, if they pass it, is set to sign it, where the Attorney General can ban any and all guns simply by uttering the word, ex cathedra.
[03:38:12.158 --> 03:38:13.760]  Uh, literally as God-Emperor.
[03:38:13.760 --> 03:38:14.901]  I mean, this, you can't make it up.
[03:38:14.901 --> 03:38:20.806]  It's up on InfoWars.com, now in the News & Focus Archive, uh, or Featured Story Archive.
[03:38:20.806 --> 03:38:22.647]  Let's go to another caller here.
[03:38:22.647 --> 03:38:23.568]  This isn't a drill, folks.
[03:38:23.568 --> 03:38:24.248]  This is for real.
[03:38:24.248 --> 03:38:25.529]  This is happening.
[03:38:25.529 --> 03:38:27.691]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk Joe Hung Up.
[03:38:27.691 --> 03:38:29.453]  Bill in Illinois, and then others.
[03:38:29.453 --> 03:38:32.675]  Bill, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[03:38:32.675 --> 03:38:33.596]  Hi, gentlemen.
[03:38:33.596 --> 03:38:37.079]  Uh, I was hoping that we could just roll into the weekend and give people some hope.
[03:38:38.730 --> 03:38:51.719]  I know that all the information that comes out is really paralyzing and scary to most people, but the more you dive into it and see what's going on and try to wake people up and knock them out of their comas.
[03:38:51.719 --> 03:39:01.306]  I'm seeing a groundswell of people waking up in the Chicagoland area, and everybody is being laid off.
[03:39:01.306 --> 03:39:04.408]  They're trying to figure out how they're going to make rent or put food on the table.
[03:39:04.833 --> 03:39:11.145]  And now's the time when people are paying attention, and now's the time where we can all start to organize and provide solutions and...
[03:39:12.173 --> 03:39:18.278]  Start a blog, or make videos, or pass out your DVDs, and get people to be aware.
[03:39:18.278 --> 03:39:22.601]  Well, I agree, but here's an analogy, and we'll get Alan's comment, and then let you counter-comment.
[03:39:22.601 --> 03:39:26.163]  If someone is taking this information we're giving and is paralyzing, they shouldn't.
[03:39:26.163 --> 03:39:39.012]  The establishment, through chemicals, through the media, through the television, through the culture, because then we pick up the propaganda and regurgitate, then that gives it, with the pheromone activation, you know, in the true third dimension, the reality trigger in the mind.
[03:39:39.012 --> 03:39:41.034]  But that gets into some more sophisticated issues that I've
[03:39:41.634 --> 03:39:47.498]  We have to understand that it's like they've given us a big shot of a sedative
[03:39:51.286 --> 03:39:52.227]  Okay?
[03:39:52.227 --> 03:40:10.001]  And then this show is literally a shot of adrenaline, where you're laying on a railroad track, you've been shot up full of Thorazine, you can't get up, Alan Watt and I are coming in with adrenaline going, you know, to where you can actually get up and get off the track, and so we're just telling you the full truth, folks, so you know what you're facing.
[03:40:10.001 --> 03:40:10.661]  Okay?
[03:40:10.661 --> 03:40:18.528]  Because if people are being paralyzed by this, I mean, I don't know about you in my life, but I mean, Alan, when somebody starts swinging at you, I don't feel paralyzed, I go into gear.
[03:40:19.188 --> 03:40:19.769]  Mm-hmm.
[03:40:19.769 --> 03:40:20.650]  Yeah, you must do.
[03:40:20.650 --> 03:40:31.360]  Again, this is a war, and when you realize it is a war strategy and you're in it, whether you like it or not, then you have to fight back with all that you can do, no matter what it is.
[03:40:31.360 --> 03:40:33.182]  And don't be overwhelmed by it.
[03:40:33.182 --> 03:40:35.184]  This has been on the go before we were born.
[03:40:35.911 --> 03:40:41.555]  And when you realize it's always a long-term system, long-term goals, then you're still in the battle.
[03:40:41.555 --> 03:40:43.416]  It's not over until the fat lady sings.
[03:40:43.416 --> 03:40:45.917]  Yeah, you can't opt out of this.
[03:40:45.917 --> 03:40:47.118]  You can't opt out of this.
[03:40:47.118 --> 03:40:48.119]  You were born into this.
[03:40:48.119 --> 03:40:56.784]  Yes, and what you have to do, too, is realize those things which are paralyzing you, those things which are numbing your brain, like the television, and stop watching it.
[03:40:56.784 --> 03:41:02.808]  Start reading, getting into the factual information that is put out by the authorities themselves.
[03:41:02.808 --> 03:41:03.768]  You can find the stuff.
[03:41:03.768 --> 03:41:04.589]  It's all over the place.
[03:41:05.399 --> 03:41:07.601]  And realize this is all very, very real.
[03:41:07.601 --> 03:41:08.901]  What can I do?
[03:41:08.901 --> 03:41:10.462]  And start doing something.
[03:41:10.462 --> 03:41:18.928]  I started off handwriting stuff and photocopying stuff and sending out to hundreds of people who had a voice when I had none.
[03:41:18.928 --> 03:41:21.730]  And that's the sort of thing that you have to do.
[03:41:21.730 --> 03:41:24.291]  You have no option but to do something.
[03:41:24.291 --> 03:41:31.236]  And you are an active combatant in this system, whether you like it or not, because the elite have declared war upon you.
[03:41:32.264 --> 03:41:33.045]  Well, that's what I do.
[03:41:33.045 --> 03:41:39.230]  I try to bring people that I respect and I think have information that's needed to this large platform, the biggest in alternative media.
[03:41:39.230 --> 03:41:42.933]  And that's why this platform is so precious, folks, and why we need your financial support.
[03:41:42.933 --> 03:41:46.376]  Because we're trying to do, you know, this isn't a very big operation compared to the establishment.
[03:41:46.376 --> 03:41:47.116]  It's tiny.
[03:41:47.116 --> 03:41:50.779]  But compared to the Liberty Movement, this is about as big and as strong as it gets.
[03:41:50.779 --> 03:41:52.000]  And it's very expensive.
[03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:53.682]  And so, please buy the books and videos.
[03:41:53.682 --> 03:41:54.542]  Donate.
[03:41:54.542 --> 03:41:59.026]  I'm glad to see that the auction there is over $45,000 for the bullhorn.
[03:41:59.026 --> 03:42:01.028]  I had no idea it would go that high.
[03:42:01.688 --> 03:42:05.111]  But that is very, very exciting.
[03:42:05.111 --> 03:42:09.635]  And it doesn't close out until next Wednesday night, so we'll see what happens with that.
[03:42:09.635 --> 03:42:10.315]  But sir, go ahead.
[03:42:10.315 --> 03:42:13.157]  Anything else you wanted to add there briefly, Bill?
[03:42:13.157 --> 03:42:13.798]  I agree with you.
[03:42:13.798 --> 03:42:24.586]  Now is the time that people are finally, while the new rule is finally emerging, and by the way, Governor Blagojevich has been impeached by the Illinois House, and he faces trial now in the Senate.
[03:42:24.586 --> 03:42:24.927]  Go ahead.
[03:42:26.605 --> 03:42:32.649]  Alex, I was just going to add that, and I've said this before, the old saying of we are the ones we've been waiting for.
[03:42:32.649 --> 03:42:33.650]  I thank you.
[03:42:33.650 --> 03:42:41.435]  You guys actually posted some of my videos on your site this week, and I encourage people to check out How to Stop the New World Order.
[03:42:41.435 --> 03:42:42.616]  It's Alex and David Eich.
[03:42:43.314 --> 03:42:46.496]  Alex, I want to just mention quickly as a quick aside here to my main body and my caller.
[03:43:11.286 --> 03:43:16.368]  Really, if you can, I would urge you to have another money bomb as soon as possible.
[03:43:16.368 --> 03:43:23.051]  I figure you've probably got a very limited amount of artifacts there, which would probably all auction very well.
[03:43:23.051 --> 03:43:26.733]  But if that be the case, perhaps that will take the place of a money bomb for a time.
[03:43:26.733 --> 03:43:39.078]  But whatever it takes, Alex, in order for you to be able to do your job unhindered by lack of funds at this point, because they're really up in the ante faster than, well, like you say, sometimes it takes your breath away these days.
[03:43:39.078 --> 03:43:40.159]  They're moving so fast.
[03:43:40.703 --> 03:43:47.207]  And they are pulling everything off the shelf at one time, using it all at one time, in order to overwhelm us at this point.
[03:43:47.207 --> 03:43:50.129]  This is their strategy, I firmly believe that.
[03:43:50.129 --> 03:44:09.780]  But Alan, you know, the ultra elite, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the English royalty and the royalty of the Netherlands, the Vatican, black Jesuit sect, they've been promised by their god, whom they call Lucifer, that they're going to inherit the Earth.
[03:44:11.094 --> 03:44:15.917]  And he has the name of Satan now, and he is the devil.
[03:44:15.917 --> 03:44:22.780]  But they do his bidding in order to get this deal of inheriting the whole Earth eternally.
[03:44:22.780 --> 03:44:31.564]  And of course, the destruction and or aberration of all of God's creation on this planet is the devil's bidding, so we see that.
[03:44:31.564 --> 03:44:36.527]  But they're so under the illusion of Satan, the master of illusion, that they don't realize
[03:44:37.082 --> 03:44:48.747]  That, as the Bible prophesizes, they will fall completely in their efforts, and completely fail to accomplish their efforts, and actually are going to burn eternally in hell.
[03:44:48.747 --> 03:44:50.968]  They're not going to destroy it all.
[03:44:50.968 --> 03:45:04.074]  Well, actually, the question part of it, Alex, is, Alan, you know, to your knowledge, who is the elite Maximus these humans are, above the usual, most well-known villains that I've mentioned?
[03:45:05.478 --> 03:45:08.499]  Well, you might be closer to a truth than you realize.
[03:45:08.499 --> 03:45:14.961]  There's definitely a power in this world that's making itself manifest through these people.
[03:45:14.961 --> 03:45:29.264]  And one of the symptoms of it is the fact that you can't get so many thousands of workers working towards this new world order, this planned horror society, where they're all like clones of each other on every single topic.
[03:45:29.264 --> 03:45:31.165]  That in itself is not normal.
[03:45:31.165 --> 03:45:31.925]  It's unnatural.
[03:45:32.662 --> 03:45:35.644]  So there's definitely something working through them.
[03:45:35.644 --> 03:45:39.187]  It's up to the individuals who do the study to figure out what it is.
[03:45:39.187 --> 03:45:43.311]  Well, people call it spirituality, but they've proven the sixth sense.
[03:45:43.311 --> 03:45:50.416]  They've proven that we're only seeing a thin band of the full spectrum and the sixth sense.
[03:45:51.417 --> 03:46:00.726]  Aborigines always know when their mother dies, they can be 3,000 miles away in a mine, and they come out, and every time, you know, say an Australian said, my mother just died flying me out there, and they're always right.
[03:46:00.726 --> 03:46:08.354]  I mean, and I've experienced things like that, and it's true, the elite are tied together by almost like a spiritual broadcasting system.
[03:46:08.354 --> 03:46:12.398]  It's like they're downloading the same evil directory.
[03:46:12.398 --> 03:46:13.679]  What is that, Alan, in your opinion?
[03:46:15.087 --> 03:46:20.389]  Well, he went into ancient writings even before what we know as the Bible was written.
[03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:21.610]  He did talk about a war.
[03:46:21.610 --> 03:46:25.311]  A war in the heavens and in the earth.
[03:46:25.311 --> 03:46:29.613]  This is pre-Hebrew.
[03:46:29.613 --> 03:46:30.433]  And it wasn't over.
[03:46:30.433 --> 03:46:36.995]  It would last for thousands and thousands, maybe millions of years before the next clash would come along.
[03:46:36.995 --> 03:46:41.117]  And it was, again, written about in the Zoroastrian mysteries later on.
[03:46:41.707 --> 03:46:46.630]  to do with good and evil itself, always in battle with each other.
[03:46:46.630 --> 03:46:55.996]  And it's up to the individuals to say how they interpret this, but all you can really do, ultimately, is to interpret it according to your own personal life experience.
[03:46:55.996 --> 03:47:00.739]  Yeah, I can tell you how the elite, I can tell you how the elite interpret it.
[03:47:00.739 --> 03:47:04.461]  They're kind of along the fifth element line.
[03:47:04.461 --> 03:47:08.224]  And they worship... But you understand both sides and how to manipulate both sides of it, too.
[03:47:09.121 --> 03:47:13.622]  Well, that's the Illuminati Mystery Religion, is the balance that they believe in.
[03:47:13.622 --> 03:47:14.082]  Thank you, sir.
[03:47:14.082 --> 03:47:15.903]  I appreciate your call.
[03:47:15.903 --> 03:47:21.304]  Michael, Dan, and Scott, final call, straight ahead with the always intriguing Alan Watt.
[03:47:21.304 --> 03:47:22.144]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:47:33.579 --> 03:47:37.022]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:47:37.022 --> 03:47:41.285]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:47:41.285 --> 03:47:49.251]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[03:47:49.531 --> 03:47:49.951]  We're good to go!
[03:48:19.398 --> 03:48:20.859]  It is a big idea.
[03:48:20.859 --> 03:48:22.179]  A new world order.
[03:48:22.179 --> 03:48:25.681]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:48:25.681 --> 03:48:27.342]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:48:27.342 --> 03:48:28.482]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:48:48.413 --> 03:48:51.599]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:48:51.599 --> 03:48:58.931]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:49:01.960 --> 03:49:07.404]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:49:07.404 --> 03:49:11.266]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:49:11.266 --> 03:49:13.828]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:49:13.828 --> 03:49:15.009]  Most people have no idea.
[03:49:15.009 --> 03:49:15.789]  They're not after money.
[03:49:15.789 --> 03:49:17.070]  They have all the money they need.
[03:49:17.070 --> 03:49:18.051]  They're after power.
[03:49:18.051 --> 03:49:19.192]  That's what they're after these days.

[03:52:00.987 --> 03:52:01.307]  Pretty good.
[03:52:30.154 --> 03:52:37.456]  I wanted to bring up a topic for kind of deep, I don't know, deep conversation so you can get deep sophisticated on this one.
[03:52:37.456 --> 03:52:41.557]  The document called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.
[03:52:41.557 --> 03:52:43.218]  Colonel Alexander.
[03:52:43.218 --> 03:52:43.798]  Absolutely.
[03:52:43.798 --> 03:52:48.879]  To me, that document, I mean, that's basically the Rosetta Stone for the New World Order plan.
[03:52:48.879 --> 03:52:49.900]  I mean... No, no.
[03:52:49.900 --> 03:52:52.100]  They're cell towers, they're chemtrails.
[03:52:52.100 --> 03:52:54.441]  We're being hit with silent, soft kill weapons.
[03:52:55.109 --> 03:52:56.389]  Absolutely, it's all in there.
[03:52:56.389 --> 03:53:03.751]  You know, I'm sure, you know, you guys probably weren't prepared for like a real deep convo on this, but I was hoping that maybe in the future, you know, you guys could get together.
[03:53:03.751 --> 03:53:08.133]  Sir, we're totally prepared, but we got two minutes left.
[03:53:08.133 --> 03:53:10.933]  All right, well, Alan, what do you think?
[03:53:10.933 --> 03:53:13.794]  Yeah, as Brzezinski said, it's in the temperatronic era.
[03:53:13.794 --> 03:53:17.655]  He mentioned this technology briefly, but it's been set up for a while.
[03:53:17.655 --> 03:53:24.337]  It's old technology, but you know, we're setting up the equipment publicly in high concentration areas.
[03:53:24.941 --> 03:53:29.143]  And it will be used during the coming riots.
[03:53:29.143 --> 03:53:33.966]  I've been trying to... Go ahead.
[03:53:33.966 --> 03:53:46.672]  I've been trying to kind of talk to a lot of... I live in Massachusetts, and there's, you know, a huge Masonic community in this particular state, and I'm trying to explain to a lot of these people that, you know, they don't always tell you the truth, even if you are an initiate.
[03:53:46.672 --> 03:53:50.634]  And I try to explain... I want to know if I'm accurate when I say this.
[03:53:51.403 --> 03:53:57.806]  Most of the symbology has two meanings, and they use the dual meanings for a psychological profile.
[03:53:57.806 --> 03:53:58.327]  Or more!
[03:53:58.327 --> 03:53:59.948]  Let me explain how it works in a nutshell.
[03:53:59.948 --> 03:54:02.549]  We've got to end the show, and I appreciate your call, and I'm sorry to the other callers.
[03:54:02.549 --> 03:54:06.111]  I promise, next time it's Alan on, you call and say you got cut off.
[03:54:06.111 --> 03:54:09.353]  You'll go to the head of the line, and we'll let Alan close the show out with his comment on this.
[03:54:10.706 --> 03:54:17.692]  It's triple, quadruple meaning the porch masons, the masons, you can argue they were taken over, they're always bad.
[03:54:17.692 --> 03:54:19.433]  It's meant to control good men.
[03:54:19.433 --> 03:54:21.876]  And so later as higher level masons, they make them ride out.
[03:54:21.876 --> 03:54:23.097]  What would you do in this situation?
[03:54:23.097 --> 03:54:24.258]  What would you do in that situation?
[03:54:24.258 --> 03:54:27.480]  If you're a good person, they say, oh good, you're one of us, but they shelve you.
[03:54:27.480 --> 03:54:30.663]  If you're evil, they raise you up and elevate you.
[03:54:30.663 --> 03:54:32.705]  Alan Watt, closing comments on that.
[03:54:32.705 --> 03:54:36.328]  Well, they ask them at the top, do you want to have the crown or do you want to be a servant?
[03:54:36.328 --> 03:54:38.970]  So when it takes the crown, it's put off to the sidelines.
[03:54:39.863 --> 03:54:43.307]  Everything's a test, yeah.
[03:54:43.307 --> 03:54:43.868]  Absolutely.
[03:54:43.868 --> 03:54:45.650]  Anything else, Alan?
[03:54:45.650 --> 03:54:49.475]  Yes, the Lower Masons, as Pike said, are just the outer portico.
[03:54:49.475 --> 03:54:50.536]  They're no different.
[03:54:50.536 --> 03:54:52.939]  They know more than the general public.
[03:54:52.939 --> 03:54:53.901]  But they're useful idiots.
[03:54:55.143 --> 03:54:56.464]  Alan Watt, great talking to you.
[03:54:56.464 --> 03:54:57.906]  We'll talk to you again in the near future.
[03:54:57.906 --> 03:54:59.047]  God bless.
[03:54:59.047 --> 03:55:00.188]  And you too.
[03:55:00.188 --> 03:55:01.630]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55:01.630 --> 03:55:04.112]  Rebroadcast starts one place.
[03:55:04.112 --> 03:55:06.314]  Infowars.com right now.
[03:55:06.314 --> 03:55:07.816]  We'll be back in one minute.
[03:55:07.816 --> 03:55:08.597]  Stay with us.
[03:55:08.597 --> 03:55:10.098]  Have a great weekend.
[03:55:10.098 --> 03:55:10.479]  Great job.
