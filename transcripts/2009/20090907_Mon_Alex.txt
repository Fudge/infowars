[00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:05.012]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:06.713]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:08.553]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.193 --> 00:00:10.013]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.793 --> 00:00:11.714]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:15.935]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:20.616]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:29.978]  Look, we've had a lot of great calls dealing with the flu and medical workers being told they're being told they've got to take it, there's no law, it's just made up.
[00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:34.819]  I got a guest coming on for about 30 minutes and I'm going to continue with your calls.
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.146]  But I want to cycle through the calls and get people to call in who see NLE09 martial law takeover drill going on.
[00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:44.008]  That's not me saying that, FEMA says that.
[00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:46.090]  This is foreign troops with U.S.
[00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:55.619]  troops in FEMA and local police in a federalization drill which practices federalizing everything and then bringing the federal government under international control.
[00:00:56.548 --> 00:00:59.230]  And everything's been building towards martial law for a long time.
[00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.952]  This is probably just one more drill.
[00:01:01.432 --> 00:01:03.294]  But we have to pay attention to each event.
[00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:04.715]  We can't become conditioned to this.
[00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:11.020]  But let's take a few calls right now before this investigative journalist joins us about weird secret societies in DC.
[00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:16.004]  Right now, let's go to... Who's up next here?
[00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:17.885]  Joel in Ohio.
[00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:19.066]  You're on the air, Joel.
[00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:21.348]  Hi, Alex.
[00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:22.349]  Hey, buddy.
[00:01:23.368 --> 00:01:26.629]  Yeah, I have a question about the flu vaccination.
[00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.851]  Now, I understand that there's no real laws about the vaccinations and its policies and recommendations.
[00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:34.951]  Yeah, there's never been a law.
[00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:39.712]  There's an executive order signed by Bush and then reauthorized by Obama.
[00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:44.893]  But when they run around saying, oh, you gotta take the shot currently, they haven't implemented that.
[00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.434]  Notice you don't hear the White House saying it.
[00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:50.595]  They're just at the ground level so nobody gets spooked saying you gotta take the shot.
[00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:50.935]  Go ahead.
[00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:57.309]  What will the legal disposition of that be if they make it mandatory?
[00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.933]  Will that be an executive order or a real law or how will that work?
[00:02:01.993 --> 00:02:02.454]  Do we know?
[00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:09.671]  Yes, look, they're not going to be able to get everybody vaccinated this time.
[00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:23.161]  They try each time to set up the federal bureaucracy, not just here but worldwide, to force everybody onto this, to set the precedent, kind of as just a background idea that it's the law that you've got to take shots.
[00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.672]  And so they force police, medical workers, firemen.
[00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:30.674]  And most say no, most departments wake up and say no.
[00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:38.461]  Some departments have particularly cowardly, dumb people in them and weak-minded police chiefs and they accept, or weak-minded hospital heads.
[00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:41.483]  The last straw was when Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take the shot.
[00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:43.525]  He was saying, it's the law, you gotta take it.
[00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:44.526]  And people said, what law?
[00:02:44.846 --> 00:02:49.130]  And I had fire chiefs and police chiefs on and hospital heads saying no.
[00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.332]  In fact, not just no, hell no.
[00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:55.592]  So, uh, but they'll just keep coming back.
[00:02:56.173 --> 00:03:02.101]  Coming back, just like we won't let them pass carbon taxes the last five times, they're back again and this time pass it to the House.
[00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:03.944]  They won't, you know, they tried...
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.522]  Dozens of times, for more than 30 years, to pass hate crimes laws, restrict free speech.
[00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:11.423]  They finally passed it out of the House.
[00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:12.844]  It's now passed the Senate.
[00:03:13.244 --> 00:03:14.225]  It's going into conference.
[00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:21.428]  They just keep coming back, because they've got the fighting spirit, because they know the fight belongs to who wants it most.
[00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:26.731]  And we just gotta get into the fight and say, it's fun to fight these people.
[00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:32.744]  But see, once they get you to be self-centered and selfish, you don't care about anybody, including yourself.
[00:03:33.144 --> 00:03:37.946]  And once people have that attitude, it's an atmosphere where corruption and evil run wild.
[00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:42.888]  I know you are making a difference in my life, Alex.
[00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:44.649]  I work at a store.
[00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.110]  I keep Endgame in circulation.
[00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.030]  There's a waiting list for it right now.
[00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.151]  I got two copies.
[00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:51.371]  I keep it circulating.
[00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:52.852]  And now, more than ever,
[00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:57.961]  People are staying in that store after they buy their stuff, and they're listening to what I have to say.
[00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:01.702]  Whereas in the past, they would just give me a weird look and leave.
[00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:05.363]  So it's very encouraging, and I thank you for that.
[00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:08.704]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[00:04:08.744 --> 00:04:11.625]  Just keep waking people up, keep getting involved, keep spreading the word.
[00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:20.788]  I mean, look, we've gone from 5, 10, 15 percent listening to us 10 years ago, to the media's almost panicking, going, everybody's a conspiracy theorist now!
[00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.289]  Nobody believes what we don't...
[00:04:22.975 --> 00:04:23.655]  And that's right.
[00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:25.516]  No one believes anything they say.
[00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:29.397]  Even though a lot of the time the media tells the truth, because it's an issue that doesn't matter.
[00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.939]  People don't believe anything now from this scum, and that's healthy.
[00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.120]  That's how people were a hundred years ago.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.720]  That's what it is to be free!
[00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:42.362]  Oh, that old-timer up on the hill, he doesn't believe anything in the newspaper.
[00:04:42.402 --> 00:04:43.043]  He's dumb.
[00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.304]  Well, we're just finding out right now how smart that old-timer was.
[00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:48.510]  Just stop being suckers.
[00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:49.973]  God bless you folks.
[00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:52.817]  We'll be right back with an important guest on the other side.
[00:04:52.837 --> 00:04:54.200]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:03.177]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.577 --> 00:05:08.542]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.902 --> 00:05:10.643]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:15.768]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:16.929]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.889]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.871]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.151 --> 00:05:20.972]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.212 --> 00:05:23.274]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.414 --> 00:05:24.514]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.755 --> 00:05:26.096]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.296 --> 00:05:31.359]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.742]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:38.605]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:39.946]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:40.786]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:41.987]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.187 --> 00:05:42.928]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:43.969]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:46.971]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.271 --> 00:05:49.012]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:49.953]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:04.758]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.380]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:16.988]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:06:16.988 --> 00:06:17.588]  We're good to go.
[00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:36.513]  I think so.
[00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:09.767]  Did you know that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles, wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[00:07:10.087 --> 00:07:12.549]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy.
[00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:14.110]  This book is for you!
[00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.553]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth, and it's called, Here's What You Do.
[00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:23.616]  You can buy it for only $6 at here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:25.777]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:28.299]  Again, here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:29.320]  Buy it today!
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.221]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:31.381 --> 00:07:35.764]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:07:35.944 --> 00:07:41.648]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:07:41.748 --> 00:07:45.170]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.012]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:48.232 --> 00:07:53.035]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:53.416]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:53.476 --> 00:07:54.837]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:14.293]  ...for other associates of C-Street, the secretive ministry and living quarters for several members of Congress, at which Governor Sanford and Senator John Enson of Nevada both received some sort of counseling during their extramarital affairs.
[00:08:14.854 --> 00:08:22.060]  A number of other C-Street affiliates are now going on the record about the shadowy organization, mainly to defend its secrecy.
[00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:25.924]  Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma telling Roll Call newspaper, quote,
[00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:33.646]  It's a great place, and vowing to continue holding foreign policy meetings with African ambassadors at the C Street House.
[00:08:34.207 --> 00:08:46.671]  Former Ohio Congressman Tony Hall tells Politico.com the prayer breakfasts he attended at C Street were, quote, probably some of the best moments I had during the week, precisely because we closed the doors.
[00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:52.435]  Sea Street is also in the news anew because of something that happened on the House floor last week.
[00:08:53.016 --> 00:09:05.987]  A member of Congress, one with ties to Sea Street, argued against public funding for abortion services by saying that if there were public funding for abortion, Barack Obama might have been aborted as a fetus.
[00:09:06.728 --> 00:09:08.129]  Also, Clarence Thomas.
[00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.472]  If you think of it in human terms,
[00:09:13.979 --> 00:09:27.742]  There is a financial incentive that will be put in place, paid for by tax dollars, that will encourage women who are single parents, living below the poverty level, to have the opportunity for a free abortion.
[00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:34.704]  If you take that scenario and apply it to many of the great minds we have today, who would we have been deprived of?
[00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:39.225]  Our President grew up in those similar circumstances.
[00:09:40.382 --> 00:09:45.325]  If that financial incentive was in place, is it possible that his mother may have taken advantage of it?
[00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:49.487]  Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court Justice.
[00:09:50.487 --> 00:09:54.649]  If those circumstances were in place, is it possible that we have been denied his great mind?
[00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.732]  That's Representative Todd Teahart, Republican of Kansas.
[00:09:59.752 --> 00:10:02.033]  I wonder how he settled on those two.
[00:10:02.353 --> 00:10:04.054]  Clarence Thomas and Barack Obama.
[00:10:05.035 --> 00:10:05.815]  What do they have in common?
[00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:10.442]  Congressman Teahart was first elected as part of the Republican Revolution in 1994.
[00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:14.948]  He is now running for the United States Senate in Kansas.
[00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:18.372]  Joining us now is Jeff Charlotte, who wrote about Congressman Teahart.
[00:10:27.423 --> 00:10:36.009]  Hello folks, here in the last two hours of the radio show today we're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv in living color.
[00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:47.337]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members for joining us and all the AM and FM shortwave satellite internet listeners as well and the folks listening to the free podcast later at InfoWars.com.
[00:10:48.277 --> 00:10:50.639]  Jeff Charlotte, I've seen him on a lot of
[00:10:51.394 --> 00:11:12.869]  National TV programs and I read an article he wrote the New York Times He is a New York Times best-selling author of the family the secret fundamentalism at the heart of American power Actually saw an article about him in the New York Times and a contributing editor to Harper's and Rolling Stone has been writing about the intersection of religion politics and culture for more than a decade and
[00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:18.629]  His writing on religion has earned him praise from writers, and it goes on from there.
[00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:24.451]  His new book is The Family, and we've got that up on screen for everybody.
[00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:28.033]  The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power.
[00:11:28.073 --> 00:11:39.157]  He's here with us for most of the hour, then wide open phones coming up at the end of the hour, and in the fourth hour, covering the flu hype and NLEO-9, martial law drills going on.
[00:11:39.957 --> 00:11:40.577]  So that's coming up.
[00:11:40.917 --> 00:11:42.238]  Jeff, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:11:43.004 --> 00:11:44.185]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[00:11:44.265 --> 00:11:44.865]  It's a real honor.
[00:11:45.346 --> 00:11:46.186]  You bet, an honor to have you.
[00:11:46.266 --> 00:11:52.410]  I wanted to play Rachel Maddow, kind of breaking down what you were going over first.
[00:11:53.971 --> 00:11:59.315]  Tell us about yourself, how you got interested in this, about this group on K Street.
[00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:08.971]  This, the family, and then how it ties into Ashcroft's group, the Brotherhood, that's also out of another house or the same house.
[00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:10.412]  It all gets confusing.
[00:12:10.432 --> 00:12:16.996]  There's other secretive right-wing Christian groups, like the Council on National Policy.
[00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:22.078]  There's a lot of different organizations, and I haven't studied them all, but I've tried to look at some of them.
[00:12:22.118 --> 00:12:24.780]  Tell us, tell us about how you woke up to this group.
[00:12:25.987 --> 00:12:29.728]  Well, Professor Tate, C Street, not K Street.
[00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:30.288]  C Street!
[00:12:30.328 --> 00:12:30.808]  There you go.
[00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:31.989]  Yes, I'm going to mark it.
[00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:36.330]  We think of K Street as the kind of the avenue of influence in Washington.
[00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.150]  I think we've got it now.
[00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.851]  We've got a lobbyist.
[00:12:37.911 --> 00:12:38.991]  I had a Freudian slip.
[00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:39.791]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:12:39.951 --> 00:12:42.272]  Exactly, whether they're active or not, can't say.
[00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:44.973]  You know, it began several years ago.
[00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:47.494]  I was working on my first book.
[00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:55.476]  I was traveling around the country and spending time with unusual religious communities and a friend of mine worried that her brother had joined a cult.
[00:12:56.116 --> 00:12:57.337]  Uh, said, would you meet with him?
[00:12:57.637 --> 00:12:59.459]  Uh, this was way back in, uh, 2011.
[00:13:00.459 --> 00:13:01.740]  And, uh, so this guy came up.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.742]  I've known him for 12 years and, frankly, he's always been kind of a jerk.
[00:13:05.383 --> 00:13:15.390]  Um, but he, he had really turned his life around, uh, despite the fact he left his career, left his, uh, relationship to move to Washington and be of service to powerful people.
[00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.712]  And he said, look, you won't understand it unless you see it.
[00:13:18.072 --> 00:13:19.733]  And you can't get in unless you're invited.
[00:13:19.793 --> 00:13:21.113]  And I said, well, how do I apply?
[00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.854]  And he said, there are no applications, there's just the family.
[00:13:24.274 --> 00:13:33.776]  So that sounded interesting to me, not as a believer, but just as a person who's interested about the variety of the religious experience, you might say.
[00:13:34.176 --> 00:13:37.577]  So I went down and spent about a month living with these guys.
[00:13:37.637 --> 00:13:41.939]  And I didn't know it was political at first, but then we had a visit from Senator Jesse Helms.
[00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:43.279]  I said, okay, all right.
[00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:44.660]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:54.788]  I mean, this doesn't sound, and I'm not defending the group, because I don't even know enough about it to even get its name right, but C Street, the family, C Street's the name, and obviously the house.
[00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:01.154]  If it's such a cult, and I do agree it looks pretty culty, why did they just let you right in then?
[00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:06.029]  You know, first of all, I actually say that they are not a cult.
[00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:08.030]  I don't think they are cultish, but not a cult.
[00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.071]  You know, the cult has certain characteristics.
[00:14:10.111 --> 00:14:11.051]  They are cultish.
[00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:13.993]  They've got the cult of personality around their leader, Doug Coe.
[00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:19.035]  But what they really believe, they really believe in the sort of networks of elites.
[00:14:19.655 --> 00:14:21.936]  And so because I was invited, that's the only way you get in.
[00:14:21.976 --> 00:14:22.557]  You get invited.
[00:14:22.577 --> 00:14:27.299]  So because I was invited by this guy, that made me sort of okay.
[00:14:27.339 --> 00:14:29.120]  And I think they were actually interested in the fact
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:35.785]  Okay, but I mean they're pretty confident then about the way they operate and the way they work to let a prominent journalist into their midst though.
[00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:58.944]  I wouldn't say I was prominent at that point, but they've been around for 70 years.
[00:14:59.344 --> 00:15:00.465]  They do believe in secrecy.
[00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:06.708]  The leader of the group Doug Coe says the more invisible you can make your organization, the more influence it will have.
[00:15:06.848 --> 00:15:11.731]  Okay, so you did infiltrate to a certain level, so this is cultish then.
[00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:14.227]  Yeah, oh, it's absolutely cultish.
[00:15:14.287 --> 00:15:20.414]  I mean, uh, you know, there's a cult of personality around this guy Doug Coe, whom they sometimes call First Brother.
[00:15:20.454 --> 00:15:24.959]  They say he has a special relationship with God, unparalleled by anyone else in the world.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:33.469]  Uh, and that, uh, also that the Inner Circle members, and here's where it gets really creepy when we're talking about Senator N. Finn and Governor Stanford, guys linked to the group,
[00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:38.491]  The inner circle members are not bound by the same morality that applies to the rest of us.
[00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:45.133]  The morality is a human construct and God has a different story ready for these powerful men.
[00:15:45.513 --> 00:15:47.614]  Now is this the same group that Ashcroft's part of?
[00:15:47.634 --> 00:15:55.937]  Because I saw articles like four or five years ago about and did some research about Ashcroft part of a house he lived at and other people that were members.
[00:15:55.977 --> 00:15:58.318]  I mean is this the only group like this or are you aware of others?
[00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:03.641]  Yeah, so that was your article I did read about how they don't really care about abortion and they like Machiavelli, wasn't it?
[00:16:20.635 --> 00:16:21.435]  I'm going from memory.
[00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:23.436]  Not as much as John Ashcroft.
[00:16:23.496 --> 00:16:25.997]  I found letters dating back to the early 1980s.
[00:16:26.497 --> 00:16:33.300]  John Ashcroft was writing to the leader of the group, Doug Coe, for his brother, saying that he wanted to get involved and could he help.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.701]  And that's what the family has done historically.
[00:16:35.741 --> 00:16:42.543]  They've identified guys that they think they can work with, and then they groomed them and sort of raised them up the political ladder.
[00:16:42.563 --> 00:16:46.745]  Doug Coe, the leader of the group, he likes to say, we work with Powell where we can,
[00:16:47.205 --> 00:16:47.905]  We're good to go.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.083]  Then you can actually comprehend, but I know there's all these weird secretive groups.
[00:17:11.123 --> 00:17:24.391]  Did you ever run into any connections in this group with Masons, Masonic groups, or with Opus Dei Catholic groups, or with the CNP, Council on National Policy?
[00:17:25.162 --> 00:17:30.686]  There's a lot of overlap with the CNP, guys like Ed Meese and various members like that.
[00:17:31.447 --> 00:17:34.589]  But one of the most interesting connections I did find was Opus Dei.
[00:17:34.649 --> 00:17:41.094]  And you might almost describe the family as kind of a Protestant Opus Dei, but they lack even the integrity of Opus Dei.
[00:17:42.933 --> 00:17:43.754]  We're good to go.
[00:18:03.012 --> 00:18:11.944]  From our research, I got to spend a lot of time with Senator Sam Roundback of Kansas, who has a unique distinction of being a member of the family and an associate of Opus Dei.
[00:18:11.964 --> 00:18:20.616]  He converted to a very strange kind of Catholicism through Opus Dei's chapel, which, appropriately enough, actually is on K Street in Washington.
[00:18:21.616 --> 00:18:24.117]  Okay, see those are the questions I haven't seen asked on television.
[00:18:24.157 --> 00:18:27.619]  I've read your articles over the years and haven't read your book yet, though we just got it.
[00:18:28.139 --> 00:18:35.043]  And so I've got a piece here, a piece there, and I'm trying to delve more into the architecture of left-wing and right-wing groups.
[00:18:35.423 --> 00:18:38.345]  Did you ever run into any connections to Bohemian Grove?
[00:18:38.405 --> 00:18:48.870]  Because a lot of, quote, Christian conservatives that have these big public personas as Christian conservatives also go to the Grove that Richard Nixon described as a homosexual orgy.
[00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:57.802]  I don't know about that part, but Doug Coe certainly is a long-time, Doug Coe, the leader of the group, is a long-time attendee.
[00:18:58.843 --> 00:19:07.568]  And, you know, certainly we're talking about here, you know, guys like Ed Meese, Senator, former Attorney General Ashcroft, Senator Enston, we're talking about the power elite.
[00:19:07.848 --> 00:19:09.309]  And so they do go to Bohemian Grove.
[00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:11.290]  There is a Vatican connection.
[00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:14.032]  There is a Bohemian Grove connection.
[00:19:14.092 --> 00:19:15.133]  It's just always the same.
[00:19:16.016 --> 00:19:19.297]  Well, you know, I'm actually wary of calling that a Vatican connection.
[00:19:19.317 --> 00:19:20.738]  I would call that an Open Day connection.
[00:19:20.778 --> 00:19:23.679]  I think Open Day is a little bit distinct.
[00:19:23.699 --> 00:19:28.861]  I mean, you know, look, mainstream American Catholicism, I have no issue with that whatsoever.
[00:19:28.881 --> 00:19:30.681]  Oh, hey, I'm not here bashing any groups either.
[00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:32.282]  I mean, this is a secular radio show.
[00:19:32.642 --> 00:19:34.743]  I'm trying to see how all these groups tie together.
[00:19:38.976 --> 00:19:41.300]  Wow, well listen, I'm going to try to let you roll when we get back.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.644]  I just wanted to ask some questions that I haven't heard asked of you before.
[00:19:43.664 --> 00:19:48.532]  It's really great having you here with us.
[00:19:48.612 --> 00:19:51.177]  The book, ladies and gentlemen, is The Family.
[00:19:52.382 --> 00:19:54.944]  And it is available all over bookstores.
[00:19:55.024 --> 00:19:57.146]  It's got a great cover, too, but also a great book inside.
[00:19:57.527 --> 00:20:00.289]  Jeff Charlotte, he'll be our guest on the other side of the screen.
[00:20:00.309 --> 00:20:01.770]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.312]  September 4th, 2009.
[00:20:03.772 --> 00:20:04.733]  Gold opened this morning at $9.90.
[00:20:05.273 --> 00:20:10.878]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $10.18.88, $5.09.44 for the half-ounce, or $2.54.72 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:20:10.898 --> 00:20:11.378]  That's $10.18.88, $5.09.44, or $2.54.72.
[00:20:18.064 --> 00:20:21.847]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[00:20:22.008 --> 00:20:26.051]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[00:20:26.231 --> 00:20:30.715]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[00:20:30.875 --> 00:20:36.240]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.563]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[00:20:39.663 --> 00:20:42.525]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust?
[00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:44.527]  Or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:47.731]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:52.478]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems?
[00:20:52.518 --> 00:20:54.320]  Or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.261]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:03.484 --> 00:21:03.924]  It's here!
[00:21:04.145 --> 00:21:08.908]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:21:09.288 --> 00:21:16.934]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:21:17.628 --> 00:21:24.692]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:21:25.072 --> 00:21:36.478]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:21:36.818 --> 00:21:40.340]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:21:40.781 --> 00:21:42.441]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:46.904]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.120]  Wow.
[00:22:03.661 --> 00:22:05.361]  All I can say is wow.
[00:22:05.882 --> 00:22:07.602]  Times are changing fast.
[00:22:08.143 --> 00:22:09.143]  Scary needles.
[00:22:09.483 --> 00:22:11.464]  Laws changing until pretty soon.
[00:22:11.864 --> 00:22:14.245]  It'll be against the law to grow a tomato plant.
[00:22:14.505 --> 00:22:16.186]  How does this fit into health care?
[00:22:16.426 --> 00:22:17.167]  I'm not sure.
[00:22:17.427 --> 00:22:21.328]  But I am sure that Life Change T will give attention to your health.
[00:22:21.489 --> 00:22:22.049]  Good health.
[00:22:22.489 --> 00:22:24.610]  Join the many that have made the change.

[00:22:42.824 --> 00:22:43.985]  It doesn't come any easier.
[00:22:44.285 --> 00:22:45.826]  GetTheTea.com.
[00:22:46.146 --> 00:22:49.767]  Oh yeah, and right now is our semi-annual special underway.
[00:22:50.148 --> 00:22:53.449]  It won't last long, so order now while you still can.

[00:22:59.693 --> 00:23:06.478]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[00:23:06.639 --> 00:23:09.221]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[00:23:09.501 --> 00:23:13.964]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[00:23:14.124 --> 00:23:18.547]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[00:23:18.648 --> 00:23:20.549]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:21.150]  We're good to go!
[00:23:40.111 --> 00:23:40.391]  We're good.
[00:24:13.883 --> 00:24:19.788]  Folks, just a program note, in the next couple of weeks, and in the next month and a half, we're going to have some huge guests on.
[00:24:19.808 --> 00:24:21.869]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.593]  And no, those huge guests are not the big astronauts we've got coming on in the next two weeks.
[00:24:28.094 --> 00:24:29.215]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:24:29.235 --> 00:24:34.278]  A little Easter egg, as they say, like on a DVD, a little hidden goody.
[00:24:34.298 --> 00:24:36.160]  That is coming up later.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:45.827]  Going back to the author of The Family, Jeff Charlotte, and this is just a bottomless pit of weirdness, but he's a great journalist, writes for Harper's.
[00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:49.851]  And for the New York Times as well.
[00:24:49.871 --> 00:24:53.752]  I saw an article in the New York Times, he writes for Harper's and Rolling Stone.
[00:24:54.173 --> 00:24:59.936]  The reason I was bringing up Harper's, it was actually Harper's had the interview with Nixon when he was talking about the Bohemian Grove.
[00:25:00.476 --> 00:25:03.177]  And so that was where my quote from that came.
[00:25:03.417 --> 00:25:04.318]  Okay, you got the floor.
[00:25:04.358 --> 00:25:06.239]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:07.939]  Start at the beginning.
[00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:11.701]  You get to get inside there.
[00:25:12.122 --> 00:25:14.863]  You've written articles about how it's not really Christian though.
[00:25:15.874 --> 00:25:21.798]  From not wanting to stop abortion and saying we like Machiavelli, I'm going from memory here, but a lot of weird stuff.
[00:25:21.858 --> 00:25:22.619]  What is it really?
[00:25:22.939 --> 00:25:24.961]  Some type of strange intelligence front?
[00:25:25.201 --> 00:25:28.023]  Because just in a snapshot, that's what it looks like to me.
[00:25:28.043 --> 00:25:30.745]  You know, it goes back, it begins in 1935.
[00:25:30.965 --> 00:25:37.270]  They organize Abram Brady believes that he has a vision that God comes to him and speaks to him.
[00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:41.433]  Tells him that Christianity hasn't been getting it wrong for 2,000 years.
[00:25:41.493 --> 00:25:44.355]  And he's focused on the poor, the weak, the suffering, the down and out.
[00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:45.575]  That's not right.
[00:25:45.815 --> 00:25:51.517]  What God wants him to be is a missionary to and for the powerful, the up-and-out, he calls them.
[00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:56.119]  He begins organizing guys like Henry Ford and a group of congressmen.
[00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:58.459]  He gets some businessmen together.
[00:25:58.479 --> 00:26:00.040]  He starts out in the state of Washington.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.881]  They manage to elect a governor, and on that basis, they start going overseas.
[00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:09.623]  They're involved with the whitewashing of Nazis after World War II, and then they start
[00:26:10.183 --> 00:26:10.823]  Excuse me?
[00:26:11.304 --> 00:26:12.764]  Excuse me, something about Nazis?
[00:26:13.284 --> 00:26:14.585]  Yeah, yeah, I'm afraid so.
[00:26:14.725 --> 00:26:18.487]  It's always suspicious when someone talks about that stuff, but... No, it's not!
[00:26:18.547 --> 00:26:20.247]  I mean, you mentioned Henry Ford.
[00:26:20.267 --> 00:26:21.888]  Henry Ford, exactly.
[00:26:21.968 --> 00:26:24.109]  They began with this idea.
[00:26:24.489 --> 00:26:30.071]  You know, not only did God want them to serve the powerful instead of the powerless, but they began with this idea.
[00:26:30.111 --> 00:26:33.313]  They were looking around the world in the 1930s and they thought democracy was done.
[00:26:33.353 --> 00:26:36.934]  They said democracy cannot compete with fascism and communism.
[00:26:37.254 --> 00:26:38.895]  Well, communism was definitely not for them.
[00:26:39.355 --> 00:26:40.996]  These are very wealthy businessmen.
[00:26:41.376 --> 00:26:53.642]  And fascism, fascism looks pretty good, but they didn't like Hitler, they didn't like Mussolini, so they said, what we're going to do is totalitarianism for Christ, which is sort of missing the point of the Christian message, but that was their approach.
[00:26:53.662 --> 00:27:04.987]  And they started recruiting a lot of American fascist sympathizers, and over the years, when they go and make alliances with foreign dictators, they look for guys who exemplify that model.
[00:27:05.047 --> 00:27:06.168]  Doug Coe, the leader of the group,
[00:27:07.009 --> 00:27:07.710]  I don't think so.
[00:27:24.711 --> 00:27:26.632]  It is a New Testament, and this is their reading.
[00:27:26.652 --> 00:27:30.093]  It's not about love or mercy or injustice or forgiveness.
[00:27:30.234 --> 00:27:31.434]  It's about power.
[00:27:31.814 --> 00:27:33.115]  And those guys understood power.
[00:27:33.155 --> 00:27:36.076]  So you want to model yourself on power.
[00:27:36.096 --> 00:27:41.218]  Another sermon you can find actually online on the website of the Navigators, a Christian right group.
[00:27:41.238 --> 00:27:44.720]  They have an audio sermon of code saying, you know how Jesus said,
[00:27:45.703 --> 00:27:51.645]  You've got to put me before your mother, father, brother, sister, because, well, Hitler, Mao, that's what they taught the kids, direct quote.
[00:27:52.205 --> 00:27:58.848]  Mao even had the kids killing their parents, but it wasn't murder, Steve, because it was for building the new nation, the new kingdom.
[00:27:58.968 --> 00:28:11.132]  My God, this guy, hold on, I mean, this is incredible, and you were there, this is published, it's in your book, and I'm familiar with the fake right-wing Chicago School of Business, all of this,
[00:28:12.192 --> 00:28:21.674]  Milton Friedman, you know, the same social... Oh yeah, the Straussians, there's a real overlap with those guys, because those guys are all going on this premise of what Plato called the noble lies.
[00:28:21.734 --> 00:28:25.955]  The idea that regular folks can't handle the truth and some of each need to make decisions for it.
[00:28:25.975 --> 00:28:27.736]  And that's why they like Machiavelli.
[00:28:27.776 --> 00:28:28.636]  Man, but see?
[00:28:28.976 --> 00:28:30.116]  See, it's all interconnected.
[00:28:30.216 --> 00:28:31.637]  I didn't know they were into Straussian.
[00:28:32.037 --> 00:28:34.277]  I just knew it fit with the Chicago school.
[00:28:34.958 --> 00:28:36.758]  Man, these people are just monstrous.
[00:28:36.818 --> 00:28:40.619]  But, you know, Obama has got a bunch of the Straussians pulling his strings.
[00:28:41.383 --> 00:28:43.105]  Yeah, he's got some family guys in there, too.
[00:28:43.145 --> 00:28:51.252]  General Jim Jones, who's, you know, one of his close advisors, the guy who's been on... Oh my God, General James L. Jones?
[00:28:51.572 --> 00:28:54.415]  The head of the National Security Council?
[00:28:54.675 --> 00:28:55.696]  The real government?
[00:28:56.437 --> 00:28:58.438]  Indeed, and I'll tell you one that's a little bit crazier.
[00:28:58.458 --> 00:28:59.599]  She's not a member of the group.
[00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:01.500]  She's what they call a friend of the group.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.181]  They're very careful about those distinctions.
[00:29:04.301 --> 00:29:10.924]  She says of Doug Pell, this man I was just quoting, this language right here by his mouth, she says he's a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide.
[00:29:10.944 --> 00:29:14.066]  She says she turned to him when she first came to Washington in 1994.
[00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:18.488]  Who am I talking about but none other than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
[00:29:18.628 --> 00:29:19.268]  Oh my gosh.
[00:29:19.328 --> 00:29:20.549]  Hold on, let me stop you.
[00:29:20.589 --> 00:29:21.329]  Let me stop you.
[00:29:21.349 --> 00:29:22.250]  So it's bipartisan.
[00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.710]  Hold on.
[00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.190]  We got a break.
[00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:25.111]  This is blowing me away.
[00:29:25.131 --> 00:29:26.452]  We're going to do the full hour with you.
[00:29:26.472 --> 00:29:27.573]  Two long segments coming up.
[00:29:27.593 --> 00:29:28.313]  That was a short one.
[00:29:28.773 --> 00:29:30.955]  See, the problem is, I haven't read the book yet.
[00:29:30.975 --> 00:29:32.196]  I've read a lot of your news articles.
[00:29:32.476 --> 00:29:37.179]  A lot of what's in there I've confirmed separate places over the years, so I know you're telling the truth.
[00:29:37.199 --> 00:29:39.841]  Plus, they admit you went there and lived there.
[00:29:40.721 --> 00:29:43.843]  So, but it's just all these dots just connected.
[00:29:44.263 --> 00:29:47.526]  And people kept asking me about CMP, CMP, CMP.
[00:29:47.866 --> 00:29:49.067]  I didn't really know much about it.
[00:29:49.207 --> 00:29:49.507]  Now,
[00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:53.693]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.614 --> 00:29:57.317]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.162 --> 00:30:04.143]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:30:04.403 --> 00:30:06.183]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:30:06.403 --> 00:30:14.685]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:20.147]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:30:20.467 --> 00:30:22.087]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:30:22.327 --> 00:30:28.653]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:30:28.853 --> 00:30:39.603]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:40.404]  That's right.
[00:30:40.684 --> 00:30:42.987]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:30:43.247 --> 00:30:44.828]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:47.411]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:07.475]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:31:07.755 --> 00:31:23.728]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:31:23.988 --> 00:31:29.112]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:31:29.332 --> 00:31:35.619]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:39.463]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:31:39.763 --> 00:31:42.346]  Solar powered generators are finally available.
[00:31:42.446 --> 00:31:47.812]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:31:48.112 --> 00:31:50.734]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:50.794 --> 00:31:52.996]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:31:53.016 --> 00:31:55.477]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:31:55.517 --> 00:31:59.860]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:01.742]  Okay folks, quiz time.
[00:32:03.899 --> 00:32:04.119]  I think so.
[00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:31.657]  With the extensive knowledge gained from the seven items in the whole enchilada package, which include books, cards, and video, as well as two free gifts.
[00:32:32.078 --> 00:32:38.283]  Now, I'd love to say this resource will always be available as your safety net, but in a national emergency, that may just not be true.
[00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:39.724]  And now it's on sale!
[00:32:39.764 --> 00:32:43.067]  That's right, until September 14th, everything is 10% off.

[00:32:51.274 --> 00:32:52.134]  That works.
[00:32:52.254 --> 00:32:52.374]  Okay!
[00:33:20.615 --> 00:33:21.376]  I'm going to be honest.
[00:33:21.536 --> 00:33:23.857]  I'm going to be honest with listeners.
[00:33:23.877 --> 00:33:25.979]  A lot of times when I have a guest on, I'm focused.
[00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:26.980]  I've got notes.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.980]  I've got a bunch of facts.
[00:33:29.462 --> 00:33:33.044]  A few days ago, I saw Mr. Charlotte on Rachel Maddow.
[00:33:33.124 --> 00:33:37.307]  I was back in the break room drinking coffee and eating dinner, up here working on a film.
[00:33:38.008 --> 00:33:39.569]  And I said, I've read his stuff before.
[00:33:39.589 --> 00:33:42.751]  Yeah, I know about Ashcroft and all those guys in this group.
[00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:45.407]  I've been doing some more research on that.
[00:33:45.468 --> 00:33:46.348]  I want to get him on.
[00:33:46.709 --> 00:33:52.634]  But Mattel was making it a left-right thing about how these guys are all cheating on their wives and how they're hypocrites.
[00:33:53.154 --> 00:34:01.602]  And I was like, I've read his articles and other articles about this group, how it's all Machiavellian and the end justifies the means and dictators and strongmen.
[00:34:01.662 --> 00:34:10.230]  And I go, man, that fits into Chicago school and the neocons and, you know, this whole sick philosophy.
[00:34:12.296 --> 00:34:16.880]  That the Globalist is kind of used to get well-meaning men to do evil things.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:21.344]  The higher-up psychopaths are using it as a control system, and it's one of many groups.
[00:34:22.124 --> 00:34:31.612]  But certainly, then as he made the connections to even more powerful organizations, and I guess there is something to this, you know, I don't get too obsessed on this group or that group.
[00:34:32.113 --> 00:34:36.757]  I've found if it's CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove,
[00:34:37.555 --> 00:34:39.036]  Then it's every other group.
[00:34:39.096 --> 00:34:42.878]  The leadership of these groups are the leadership of all the other groups.
[00:34:43.439 --> 00:34:45.140]  And so it's kind of an interlocking directorate.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:56.327]  But I'll be honest, now that I heard him roll with info I'd never heard him say on the shows because they always compartmentalize it, it made all these connections because you've got
[00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:02.772]  Other secretive right-wing groups, like the CMP, and I've had guests on over the years that mention that.
[00:35:02.832 --> 00:35:10.674]  I thought of it more as a right-wing think tank that were globalists, but it also had some anti-globalists in it, like the Hunt brothers, so that confused me.
[00:35:11.714 --> 00:35:14.095]  And I don't think anything's the top of the pyramid.
[00:35:14.135 --> 00:35:17.816]  I think at the top of the pyramid, it's all these groups nexusing in.
[00:35:18.136 --> 00:35:19.297]  But then I didn't know there was a
[00:35:20.157 --> 00:35:21.097]  Opus Dei connection.
[00:35:21.137 --> 00:35:22.218]  I just threw it out there.
[00:35:22.458 --> 00:35:24.058]  He said yes and listened to the names.
[00:35:24.538 --> 00:35:27.959]  And then a Pentagon connection with the head of national security.
[00:35:27.979 --> 00:35:29.880]  That's what's really the real shadow government.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:35.301]  James Earl Jones and the Chicago School and the neocons.
[00:35:36.061 --> 00:35:37.922]  And so you just blew me away.
[00:35:38.022 --> 00:35:39.262]  You just got my attention.
[00:35:40.226 --> 00:35:44.170]  And so I want to get more of the Open State Connection, more of the National Security Connection.
[00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.632]  Take your time on Hillary as a friend.
[00:35:47.633 --> 00:35:51.517]  Take your time on their missions, their operations, what they're doing worldwide.
[00:35:51.537 --> 00:35:52.678]  I know you covered all in the book.
[00:35:52.718 --> 00:35:54.280]  I've read part of it just now.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.343]  And already a bestseller, The Family, Jeff Charlotte.
[00:35:57.363 --> 00:35:58.184]  But Jeff, go ahead.
[00:35:58.504 --> 00:36:10.081]  Run through it all, give us the key information here, and bottom line, just from knowing what I know about separate groups that nexus in, this does sound pretty sinister.
[00:36:12.166 --> 00:36:14.669]  Yeah, I'm glad you're saying this, Alex, and I think you're exactly right.
[00:36:14.689 --> 00:36:17.812]  We never want to make the mistake of saying there's one group that controls it all.
[00:36:18.152 --> 00:36:26.260]  There's multiple power bases, and, you know, the point I'm trying to make here is that the family is one of the most influential power bases, and yet it hasn't been measured.
[00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:31.626]  A sociologist, a conservative sociologist, actually, has it happened down there in Texas at Rice University.
[00:36:32.046 --> 00:36:41.769]  There's a survey of 360 politicians in Washington asking them to name the religious group that is most influential.
[00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:44.230]  One in three named the family.
[00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.730]  That's more than any other group got.
[00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.532]  That's more votes than James Dawson's focus on the family, more than any other group.
[00:36:50.752 --> 00:36:54.993]  They named the family and what's crazy about this is the family denies that they exist.
[00:36:55.593 --> 00:37:05.237]  If you call up the leader of the group, as I had NBC News do last year, where I did a segment with them, and they said, oh no, there's nothing to see here, we don't exist, there's no group, it's just a group of friends.
[00:37:05.677 --> 00:37:09.459]  Fortunately, I've already shared with NBC News their tax records.
[00:37:09.499 --> 00:37:15.241]  There's 600 boxes of documents that show, I think, something that does indeed go beyond left and right.
[00:37:15.321 --> 00:37:17.082]  This is a group about power.
[00:37:17.582 --> 00:37:22.984]  Again, I'll just repeat that saying that they have, we work with power where we can, build new power where we can't.
[00:37:23.345 --> 00:37:24.305]  What that means is,
[00:37:25.066 --> 00:37:32.795]  Unlike some right-wing groups that are just sort of extensions of the Republican Party, the family wants connections to Democrats as well.
[00:37:32.955 --> 00:37:38.642]  One is Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, a pro-war Democrat from Arkansas.
[00:37:40.512 --> 00:37:42.093]  So they're apolitical.
[00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.154]  They want power.
[00:37:43.174 --> 00:37:43.454]  No, no, no.
[00:37:43.474 --> 00:37:44.314]  They're not apolitical.
[00:37:44.334 --> 00:37:45.015]  They're not apolitical.
[00:37:45.035 --> 00:37:45.635]  I wouldn't say that.
[00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:46.676]  They want power.
[00:37:46.696 --> 00:37:48.097]  They have some specific ends.
[00:37:48.598 --> 00:37:51.500]  One is they believe in sort of a free market fundamentalism.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.903]  They believe in... Well, by apolitical, I meant they don't care about labels.
[00:37:56.704 --> 00:37:58.545]  They don't care about labels, they care about power.
[00:37:58.605 --> 00:37:58.785]  Right.
[00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:00.486]  They care about power and their agenda.
[00:38:00.526 --> 00:38:01.586]  And their agenda is two things.
[00:38:01.987 --> 00:38:04.468]  It's free market fundamentalism, and it's American empire.
[00:38:04.488 --> 00:38:10.451]  That's what they've been working on for 70 years, and I heard the lead-in, so you may appreciate this.
[00:38:11.011 --> 00:38:15.734]  Back in 1945, the leader of the group, Abraham Brady, I believe coined this phrase.
[00:38:15.794 --> 00:38:18.615]  I believe he may have been the first one to use it, although I think you'll know if I'm wrong.
[00:38:19.295 --> 00:38:21.437]  He said, there's a coming new world order.
[00:38:22.197 --> 00:38:23.798]  And he says we're in a new world.
[00:38:23.818 --> 00:38:23.898]  Wow!
[00:38:24.708 --> 00:38:27.529]  1945 had it documented in their archives.
[00:38:28.969 --> 00:38:31.870]  I don't think he coined it, but the fact that he used it.
[00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.611]  Hitler used it.
[00:38:34.891 --> 00:38:37.072]  HG Wells wrote a book called The New World Order.
[00:38:37.092 --> 00:38:39.933]  It predates him, yeah.
[00:38:39.953 --> 00:38:42.313]  He was an interesting admirer of Hitler.
[00:38:43.053 --> 00:38:49.535]  Basically, they said, what we're aiming for is a form of totalitarianism.
[00:38:49.555 --> 00:38:51.576]  They said, how about a fascist dictatorship?
[00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:51.996]  Yeah.
[00:38:52.317 --> 00:38:54.058]  No, Hitler is one of the earliest.
[00:38:54.078 --> 00:38:59.143]  You can't find... Right around the same time, Hitler starts using it, then H.G.
[00:38:59.203 --> 00:39:02.966]  Wells uses it, but they both wanted different forms of socialism.
[00:39:03.226 --> 00:39:06.990]  Hitler a more fascist form, though they're supposedly on different ends of the spectrum.
[00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.492]  National Socialists, the Nazis.
[00:39:09.612 --> 00:39:13.315]  And then, Hitler wanted to have somebody kidnap and kill H.G.
[00:39:13.335 --> 00:39:13.636]  Wells.
[00:39:13.696 --> 00:39:17.299]  So, like you said, there's competing factions.
[00:39:17.319 --> 00:39:18.500]  But, go ahead.
[00:39:19.528 --> 00:39:26.873]  Well, I mean, you know, that's what, you know, when I said that the bottom line is the American empire, and that's what led them into alliances.
[00:39:27.034 --> 00:39:33.738]  You know, we were talking before the break about their role in sort of whitewashing the records of former Nazis.
[00:39:33.859 --> 00:39:45.107]  One was a guy named Hermann J. Abt, who was vice president of the German operation after the war, became known as the Wizard of the West German Miracle, a brilliant financier, until it was discovered
[00:39:45.607 --> 00:39:49.351]  Before he was Germany's banker, he was the man known as Hitler's banker.
[00:39:49.851 --> 00:39:56.918]  He, in fact, had to help spirit away untold amounts of German money to the Nazis to escape to South America.
[00:39:57.178 --> 00:40:00.802]  Oh my, so we have a Nazi connection with money coming over?
[00:40:00.842 --> 00:40:04.285]  Because we know the Bushes with Prescott have that connection.
[00:40:04.924 --> 00:40:06.425]  Well, there's more than that.
[00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:10.087]  The head of their Swiss operation after the war was a banker named Alfred Herz.
[00:40:10.587 --> 00:40:27.375]  He used the family and its access to American politicians to come over and lobby for America to lay off all the money that, of course, they had stolen from the Swiss banks, had stolen from the Jews who had been killed, and the so-called Nazi gold.
[00:40:28.115 --> 00:40:40.519]  You know, we forget that there were actually early attempts to investigate that stuff, and Alfred Herz, working through Congressman Alexander Wiley from Wisconsin and others, was able to lobby successfully using this group's network.
[00:40:40.819 --> 00:40:41.899]  That's really what this group is.
[00:40:41.919 --> 00:40:42.359]  Wait a minute!
[00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:46.881]  This is the group that blocked the investigation of the Rat Line and the gold and diamonds?
[00:40:46.901 --> 00:40:48.601]  I said they were a group, you know.
[00:40:48.621 --> 00:40:49.922]  I think you made an important point.
[00:40:49.962 --> 00:40:54.603]  There's no single group controlling all this stuff, but there's lots of different power bases in Washington.
[00:40:55.174 --> 00:40:58.277]  Yeah, it's like a swarm of viruses, or something.
[00:40:58.317 --> 00:41:00.980]  It's a whole bunch of them, but going in the same direction.
[00:41:01.321 --> 00:41:02.602]  More power, more control.
[00:41:03.223 --> 00:41:06.066]  Specifically, let's get more into that history, but can you backtrack?
[00:41:06.426 --> 00:41:09.649]  Because I read your articles years ago, and Harper's and Rolling Stone.
[00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:15.454]  Because I remember just reading this and then going and googling some of it and finding that, you know, you were telling the truth.
[00:41:15.554 --> 00:41:19.997]  It was so shocking about their philosophy and we don't care about abortion.
[00:41:20.037 --> 00:41:21.699]  We want Jesus wants power.
[00:41:22.099 --> 00:41:24.080]  We don't care about, you know, this and that.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.361]  We like Machiavelli.
[00:41:25.642 --> 00:41:29.845]  I mean, this sounds like a psycho cult masquerading as Christians.
[00:41:30.649 --> 00:41:32.991]  Well, let me give you a quote.
[00:41:33.752 --> 00:41:38.676]  This is from the news, and we had in that lead-in, we had Congressman Todd Feehart talking about abortion.
[00:41:39.076 --> 00:41:41.118]  It's not that they don't care about those issues.
[00:41:41.138 --> 00:41:43.760]  The group tends to be pretty right-wing conservatives, so they care.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.041]  This is not their bottom line.
[00:41:45.061 --> 00:41:46.563]  Their bottom line is American empire.
[00:41:47.083 --> 00:41:56.130]  But one time I was at the C Street House, this is the house in Washington, where they're providing below-market housing for congressmen, Republicans and Democrats, by the way, this is a bipartisan thing.
[00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:59.272]  This is bipartisan power-lust, you might say.
[00:41:59.872 --> 00:42:04.916]  And I was there, and Doug Coe, the leader of the group, was counseling Congressman Todd Keyhart.
[00:42:04.956 --> 00:42:06.157]  And Todd Keyhart had come in.
[00:42:06.937 --> 00:42:09.699]  Todd Keyhart is not what you would call an enlightened man.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:15.764]  He said he was concerned that the Christian was losing the race with the Muslim.
[00:42:16.284 --> 00:42:18.126]  You know, he said, what is this guy talking about?
[00:42:18.146 --> 00:42:18.866]  This is crazy.
[00:42:19.206 --> 00:42:25.311]  What he meant was, he said that Muslims are having too many babies, while Christians are not having enough.
[00:42:25.351 --> 00:42:28.413]  So it turns out, Pihar represents himself as an ardent follower of abortion.
[00:42:28.693 --> 00:42:30.314]  What he means is abortion for Christians.
[00:42:30.374 --> 00:42:32.716]  He doesn't care if Muslims have abortions.
[00:42:32.876 --> 00:42:34.057]  In fact, he would like that.
[00:42:34.417 --> 00:42:38.440]  Well, now, Pihar, listening to this, says, okay, yeah, I hear you talking about this abortion issue.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:44.182]  You know, I sort of agree with you on that, and that's fine, but I want you to think bigger.
[00:42:44.222 --> 00:42:46.883]  What I want you to do is to think in terms of a covenant.
[00:42:47.244 --> 00:42:58.028]  They describe the covenant as something that men of power enter into secretly, privately, because of a publicly invisible but privately identifiable group of companions.
[00:42:58.068 --> 00:42:59.349]  That's in their official document.
[00:42:59.769 --> 00:43:00.569]  It's a covenant.
[00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:02.350]  With a covenant, you can do so much more.
[00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.330]  Good Lord!
[00:43:21.607 --> 00:43:28.009]  But again, when you're saying all of this, I'm thinking about the Straussian economists and philosophers.
[00:43:28.089 --> 00:43:31.430]  I'm thinking about the Chicago school, the Rockefellers.
[00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:35.552]  The Rockefellers similarly funded other schools of thought.
[00:43:35.872 --> 00:43:39.433]  Do you ever run into Rockefeller foundations or Rockefeller money in all this?
[00:43:40.681 --> 00:43:41.842]  And it founded modern eugenics.
[00:43:56.087 --> 00:44:08.523]  Yeah, in the early days they were indeed giving the family, which was then known as International Christian Leadership, they changed their name every few years, they say, to avoid scrutiny, basically.
[00:44:09.244 --> 00:44:12.228]  But he gave some money to them to get started.
[00:44:12.248 --> 00:44:14.411]  I mean, you really see all the titans of American commerce.
[00:44:14.631 --> 00:44:16.231]  Well, you always have the Rockefellers.
[00:44:16.271 --> 00:44:19.992]  I mean, discovering cancer viruses, Rockefellers, setting up them.
[00:44:20.112 --> 00:44:23.133]  I mean, the whole system was set up by these people.
[00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:24.014]  See, I didn't know that.
[00:44:24.074 --> 00:44:24.734]  You're the expert.
[00:44:24.754 --> 00:44:25.574]  Of course, they're involved.
[00:44:25.794 --> 00:44:28.095]  It's kind of like you lift up a stone and that's where you find the bugs.
[00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:30.195]  But look, other key points.
[00:44:30.255 --> 00:44:30.835]  I'm interrupting.
[00:44:30.855 --> 00:44:31.956]  This just gets more insane.
[00:44:33.016 --> 00:44:34.336]  Is their power getting greater?
[00:44:34.476 --> 00:44:35.316]  Is it waning?
[00:44:35.717 --> 00:44:36.937]  Do you get threats?
[00:44:38.237 --> 00:44:40.438]  I mean, what is it like?
[00:44:41.681 --> 00:44:51.371]  I mean, this is almost maybe the comic section of the book, you know, because I've first written about this in Harper's, so in Chapter 9 of the book, The Family, I talk about some of the early reactions.
[00:44:51.552 --> 00:44:54.154]  One was the speaking engagement in Germany.
[00:44:54.174 --> 00:44:54.875]  Get over there.
[00:44:54.915 --> 00:44:57.438]  Turns out the whole speaking series is paid for by the U.S.
[00:44:57.498 --> 00:44:57.898]  Embassy.
[00:44:58.279 --> 00:44:59.059]  Get off the plane.
[00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:01.202]  My German host says, you know, there's a problem.
[00:45:01.322 --> 00:45:02.183]  Your ambassador says,
[00:45:02.823 --> 00:45:05.446]  That he cannot pay for you because you are an enemy of Jesus.
[00:45:05.466 --> 00:45:08.770]  This is the Ambassador of the United States saying this kind of thing.
[00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:09.151]  Who is it?
[00:45:09.191 --> 00:45:10.652]  It's a guy named Senator Dan Coats.
[00:45:11.153 --> 00:45:12.435]  Not the brightest bulb on the porch.
[00:45:12.455 --> 00:45:14.096]  He considers Dan Quayle his mentor.
[00:45:14.777 --> 00:45:22.126]  A guy so off the charts that when Bush proposed him for Secretary of Defense, Cheney vetoed him as too fanatical.
[00:45:23.762 --> 00:45:25.063]  That's that kind of guy.
[00:45:25.403 --> 00:45:37.368]  But even one of the other responses was a phone call I get from one day, from a guy who's an executive for the oil company Triformer, a very big international company involved in this stuff.
[00:45:37.408 --> 00:45:38.728]  He's calling me from Angola.
[00:45:39.148 --> 00:45:40.589]  Says he's just a fan of my work.
[00:45:41.069 --> 00:45:43.150]  That great, a call from Angola from a fan of my work.
[00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:48.671]  As we talk for a good old while, it turns out he's a member of the family.
[00:45:48.691 --> 00:45:51.452]  He's actually trying to recruit me back into it.
[00:45:51.472 --> 00:45:53.333]  So I try and get some counter-arguments.
[00:45:53.413 --> 00:45:56.234]  I said, what about the family's involvement in Indonesia?
[00:45:56.274 --> 00:45:59.395]  The dictator Fajardo killed 1.2 million of his own people.
[00:46:00.075 --> 00:46:04.136]  And his only counter-argument is that must be what God wanted for Indonesia.
[00:46:04.156 --> 00:46:05.936]  1.2 million people dead.
[00:46:05.956 --> 00:46:08.097]  That was God's will.
[00:46:08.137 --> 00:46:09.877]  The truth is they're playing God.
[00:46:09.938 --> 00:46:11.538]  That's what this whole power trip's about.
[00:46:12.375 --> 00:46:27.366]  Yeah, you know, it was very well put to me by... I did an interview with someone from the Cato Institute, which is a very conservative think tank in Washington, and they really believe in free markets, and so I thought they weren't going to like the book, but they looked at it and said, these guys aren't talking about free markets.
[00:46:27.406 --> 00:46:28.607]  There's nothing free about this.
[00:46:28.627 --> 00:46:29.908]  This is crony capitalism.
[00:46:30.268 --> 00:46:34.251]  The phrase they used, I thought, was really just dead on, was self-interest by proxy.
[00:46:34.611 --> 00:46:36.231]  These guys get together in a small group.
[00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:37.052]  That's what a prayer cell is.
[00:46:37.072 --> 00:46:42.993]  That's what Senator Anson, who we've been hearing about, Governor Stanford, those guys, Senator Coburn, they get together in a prayer cell.
[00:46:43.013 --> 00:46:44.073]  They don't actually read the Bible.
[00:46:44.153 --> 00:46:45.134]  I've been there for these things.
[00:46:45.154 --> 00:46:46.374]  They don't actually study the Bible.
[00:46:47.134 --> 00:46:49.055]  One man will say, you know, I have a message from Jesus.
[00:46:49.115 --> 00:46:50.995]  I think Jesus gave me a message for you.
[00:46:51.435 --> 00:46:59.117]  And in the case of Senator Anson and Coburn, the message seemed to be pay your minister some hush money to keep yourself out of the public eye.
[00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:10.257]  You know, the one thing that's really important about that whole scandal, and you mentioned talking about it on Mano, and so on, and folks on the sex scandal of the Republicans, the more important thing is that I don't care about their sex scandal.
[00:47:10.377 --> 00:47:10.918]  Exactly!
[00:47:10.958 --> 00:47:15.842]  The question is, I don't want you to get in a fight with Mano, but why is the media always making left and right?
[00:47:15.862 --> 00:47:17.263]  Mano is one of the very few people...
[00:47:17.923 --> 00:47:19.224]  Uh, uh, pushing the story.
[00:47:19.244 --> 00:47:23.226]  I mean, this story's been around for a while, and I'm not... Every now and then, someone makes an attempt.
[00:47:23.246 --> 00:47:27.749]  The Los Angeles Times did a year-long investigation in 2002, published their results.
[00:47:28.169 --> 00:47:29.070]  Incredible stuff.
[00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.691]  Linking the family to Central American death squads.
[00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:32.612]  All kinds of stuff.
[00:47:32.912 --> 00:47:34.613]  Expected, you know, waited for the Pulitzer.
[00:47:34.633 --> 00:47:36.033]  The Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter did it.
[00:47:36.554 --> 00:47:37.614]  Not up peak.
[00:47:37.975 --> 00:47:45.259]  Last year, I did a segment with NBC Nightly News, uh, with Andrew Mitchell hosting, and we had Hillary Clinton talking about her involvement.
[00:47:45.299 --> 00:47:45.599]  We had
[00:47:46.059 --> 00:47:54.927]  There's a video of Doug Coe talking about the great leadership example of the fellowship that he tries to promote is like that one enjoyed by Hitler, Himmler, and Goering.
[00:47:55.147 --> 00:48:05.756]  And, you know, NBC thought they had the scoop of the campaign season, not a peep, because our American political press, they're religiously illiterate, they don't know the questions to ask.
[00:48:06.257 --> 00:48:09.880]  Yeah, but Hitler, I mean, Hitler was a freak.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.203]  I mean, why this obsession with Hitler?
[00:48:15.827 --> 00:48:21.131]  It's the most extreme, I mean in some ways it's sort of, it is literally idiotic.
[00:48:21.271 --> 00:48:26.394]  At one point I asked someone, when I was living with her, I said, I find this very troubling.
[00:48:27.435 --> 00:48:30.957]  They said, well it's not his end that we're interested in, it's his methods.
[00:48:31.938 --> 00:48:34.700]  And you're just, you're just blown away by that.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:39.123]  But even that, they... But somebody's behavior is the manifestation of who they are.
[00:48:40.453 --> 00:48:41.373]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:48:41.413 --> 00:48:43.514]  Well, and Hitler's methods were absolutely horrific.
[00:48:43.794 --> 00:48:45.274]  But they misunderstand those.
[00:48:45.294 --> 00:48:46.314]  They like to talk about it.
[00:48:46.334 --> 00:48:48.315]  They say, look, here's what Hitler did.
[00:48:48.355 --> 00:49:01.738]  Hitler got together with a little group of friends in the back of a Bavarian beer hall, and working together, just like you guys are going to work together, whether it's Senator Anson and Senator Coburn, or two younger guys in the group, just like you work together, look what they were able to do.
[00:49:01.758 --> 00:49:03.759]  They were able to take over the world.
[00:49:03.779 --> 00:49:05.199]  But that's the same baloney!
[00:49:08.749 --> 00:49:25.263]  Well Hitler also, this is mainline history, was hired by German intelligence to set that group up to monitor people and then it got some British funding later from the King of England, Edward VIII, and so Hitler didn't just pop up out of a cabbage patch.
[00:49:25.979 --> 00:49:34.943]  Well, the important thing to recognize with these guys is that they're all sort of power-hungry political opportunists, and I think that's what you get with a family.
[00:49:35.263 --> 00:49:42.346]  You know, the thing about it is, look, a lot of the young guys I've lived with, even some of the congressmen I've spoken to, they get involved with the best of intentions.
[00:49:42.567 --> 00:49:43.747]  They really, genuinely do.
[00:49:43.787 --> 00:49:45.488]  I'll even say that of Senator Brownback.
[00:49:45.568 --> 00:49:47.809]  Yeah, that's like congressmen going to, uh...
[00:49:51.363 --> 00:50:01.227]  The head of the Washington Times, Mr. Moon, a total cult, and they said, we didn't know that this was going to be a crowning ceremony as him as the Messiah.
[00:50:01.467 --> 00:50:05.128]  There they are, embarrassed, gulping as crowns are being put on his head.
[00:50:05.368 --> 00:50:07.729]  How does that individual tie into all this?
[00:50:08.547 --> 00:50:13.833]  You know, there's a big overlap there, but you had again a distinct power base.
[00:50:14.413 --> 00:50:17.537]  But there is that overlap, and that example that you gave, we didn't know.
[00:50:17.697 --> 00:50:19.539]  I think that's been in the news.
[00:50:19.599 --> 00:50:21.921]  Again, I emphasize the bipartisan aspect of this.
[00:50:22.162 --> 00:50:25.846]  Congressman Bart Stupak of Michigan has been living for seven years.
[00:50:26.786 --> 00:50:29.848]  And there's also a Bohemian Grove connection.
[00:50:29.868 --> 00:50:31.229]  We know what Nixon said about that.
[00:50:55.808 --> 00:50:57.109]  Anyway, sir, stay there.
[00:50:57.129 --> 00:50:59.511]  We're gonna come right back and continue with other key points.
[00:51:00.512 --> 00:51:06.878]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:07.258 --> 00:51:08.920]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:09.904 --> 00:51:10.925]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:11.445 --> 00:51:11.966]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:12.246 --> 00:51:13.227]  This is his M.O.
[00:51:13.247 --> 00:51:14.548]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:14.568 --> 00:51:16.290]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:23.356]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:23.756 --> 00:51:24.197]  Some U.S.
[00:51:24.237 --> 00:51:29.882]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:30.582 --> 00:51:34.065]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:34.085 --> 00:51:36.226]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:00.322 --> 00:52:03.946]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:52:04.126 --> 00:52:14.117]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:52:14.277 --> 00:52:16.199]  There is a solution that doesn't involve
[00:52:16.539 --> 00:52:17.019]  We're good to go!
[00:52:41.015 --> 00:52:41.455]  I think so.
[00:52:59.935 --> 00:53:01.456]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:53:01.636 --> 00:53:03.098]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:53:03.378 --> 00:53:05.620]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:10.804]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:53:11.204 --> 00:53:14.067]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:54:14.247 --> 00:54:18.129]  The military drills, what do you see in your area?
[00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:20.131]  Troops from 14 nations involved.
[00:54:20.391 --> 00:54:21.112]  That's FEMA.gov.
[00:54:23.364 --> 00:54:25.186]  More on the flu, fear-mongering, all of this.
[00:54:25.226 --> 00:54:27.467]  But Jeff Charlotte, I've got to have him back up in the near future.
[00:54:27.688 --> 00:54:29.008]  JeffCharlotte.com.
[00:54:29.609 --> 00:54:34.012]  Charlotte spelled S-H-A-R-L-E-T.com.
[00:54:34.052 --> 00:54:36.074]  The book is The Family.
[00:54:36.094 --> 00:54:36.994]  We'll put that up on screen.
[00:54:37.014 --> 00:54:45.641]  But here is Mr. Moon, Sun Yung Moon, the head of the Moonies, having crowns put on, saying he's above Jesus.
[00:54:46.918 --> 00:54:50.220]  And I don't try to get in fights with all these religious groups and all this.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:56.264]  It's just that when they try to get political power and have secretive agendas, they have to be discussed.
[00:54:56.284 --> 00:54:58.325]  And I expose everything here.
[00:54:58.345 --> 00:54:59.386]  That's all we're trying to do.
[00:55:00.226 --> 00:55:01.307]  And this is freakish.
[00:55:01.963 --> 00:55:05.445]  And there's nothing Christian about John Ashcroft and his Patriot Act and the rest of it.
[00:55:05.825 --> 00:55:11.909]  There's nothing liberal about Barack Obama hiring nothing but K Street Boys now and swearing he never would.
[00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:16.611]  But I want to come back in this final five-minute segment in a few minutes to take two or three calls.
[00:55:16.671 --> 00:55:26.097]  But first, in the four or five minutes we have left in this segment, other key points you haven't told us about as you're giving us the dirt on these individuals?
[00:55:27.372 --> 00:55:33.817]  Well, you know, I think really the biggest point that we want to look at is how the family is acting like a lobby.
[00:55:33.837 --> 00:55:37.901]  They're not registered as a lobby, but they're paying for travel for congressmen to go overseas.
[00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:46.407]  Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma went on at least 20 missionary trips to Africa who paid for it.
[00:55:47.028 --> 00:55:48.529]  In that case, he actually finagled it.
[00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:54.374]  He says he went on behalf of the family, promoting the political philosophy of Jesus as taught to him by Doug Provo.
[00:55:54.414 --> 00:55:56.996]  So it's a tax-exempt lobby on top of it?
[00:55:58.414 --> 00:55:59.735]  In his case, he went even further.
[00:56:00.075 --> 00:56:03.317]  He actually got the Senate Armed Services Committee to pay for it, $187,000.
[00:56:03.638 --> 00:56:07.120]  He went to the President of Nigeria.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.943]  State Department didn't want him to meet with him, went there.
[00:56:09.963 --> 00:56:11.844]  He got Senator Colburn going to Lebanon.
[00:56:11.864 --> 00:56:15.467]  This is a country that's had civil war between Christians and Muslims for a long, long time.
[00:56:16.127 --> 00:56:17.849]  They do not need this kind of interference.
[00:56:18.189 --> 00:56:35.844]  Senator Coburn went there and he said, you know what, on his official form, paid for by the family by one of their foundations, the International Foundation, he says, I'm going to set up confidential Christian prayer cells in the Lebanese government, just like the one he used to help cover up the political affairs of Senator Enson.
[00:56:35.864 --> 00:56:46.393]  So this group is doing their stuff, and when we dig into their own history, we dig into their own archives, we don't have to accuse them or make any wild-eyed claims and so on, we see an absolutely bloody history.
[00:56:46.513 --> 00:56:48.174]  And how are you getting into their archives?
[00:56:49.234 --> 00:56:54.156]  They dump 600 boxes of unorganized papers in the Billy Graham Center archives.
[00:56:54.997 --> 00:57:08.983]  And I went there, I was one of the very first people to start poking around, and we're talking about budgets, memos, formal correspondence, even confidential government documents, a lot of stuff on congressional... Why is it at the Billy Graham Center?
[00:57:09.043 --> 00:57:09.643]  Is he involved?
[00:57:11.142 --> 00:57:12.543]  Marginally, but not too much.
[00:57:13.603 --> 00:57:14.383]  A little bit.
[00:57:14.883 --> 00:57:16.944]  I think he's got his own thing going.
[00:57:16.964 --> 00:57:24.687]  But Billy Graham did help them set up this annual ritual which has become sort of an annual lobbying festival called the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington.
[00:57:24.727 --> 00:57:26.187]  Everybody attends.
[00:57:26.227 --> 00:57:27.128]  The President attends.
[00:57:27.248 --> 00:57:27.988]  Congress attends.
[00:57:28.688 --> 00:57:31.110]  It's ostensibly ecumenical.
[00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:32.291]  Everybody is represented.
[00:57:32.672 --> 00:57:34.914]  Internal documents says anything could happen.
[00:57:35.234 --> 00:57:36.515]  Even the Koran could be read.
[00:57:36.555 --> 00:57:40.799]  And by that they meant, they're referring to Saudi Prince Bandar, who they invited to speak.
[00:57:41.379 --> 00:57:42.540]  But Jesus is there.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.121]  He's infiltrating the world.
[00:57:44.241 --> 00:57:50.407]  And by Jesus, of course, you just have to remember, they're not talking about anything you ever learned in Sunday school.
[00:57:50.447 --> 00:57:53.289]  They're talking about the idea of American empire.
[00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:56.111]  They're talking about the idea... They're talking about the Hitler Jesus.
[00:57:57.955 --> 00:58:02.099]  The Jesus of strength and power, rather than the one of love and forgiveness, yes.
[00:58:03.861 --> 00:58:13.830]  Well, look, obviously intelligence agencies love to use missionaries in groups like this, and as you said, the Rockefellers are deeply involved in that.
[00:58:15.259 --> 00:58:23.664]  So this is obviously just one more powerful group in all of this and I would imagine you would say even some of the people involved are doing so they believe for good reasons.
[00:58:24.104 --> 00:58:35.350]  I think that's what it's for is to co-opt well-meaning Christian men to kind of warp their sense for the end justifies the means to then go carry out really bad stuff.
[00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:38.892]  But we'll get your take on that in 70 seconds and take a couple phone calls.
[00:58:42.094 --> 00:58:43.835]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.227 --> 00:58:55.412]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.552 --> 00:58:57.514]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:59.957]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:59:00.077 --> 00:59:01.919]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:02.359 --> 00:59:03.721]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:03.981 --> 00:59:05.022]  There is a solution.

[00:59:53.308 --> 00:59:55.229]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.689 --> 00:59:58.471]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.499 --> 01:00:09.929]  Well, it's the final hour of this Friday edition.
[01:00:09.969 --> 01:00:13.196]  Blasting out on the Eminem Thumbnail.
[01:00:13.256 --> 01:00:14.840]  Shortwave, XM Radio, and the Internet.
[01:00:16.443 --> 01:00:24.269]  And, uh, for the rest of the hour, we're very honored to be joined by Harrison Hagen-Schmidt, or Jack Schmidt.
[01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:30.934]  And, uh, he's an American geologist, former NASA astronaut, university professor, and a U.S.
[01:00:30.974 --> 01:00:32.135]  Senator for one term.
[01:00:32.175 --> 01:00:36.398]  He is the last of the Apollo astronauts to arrive and set foot on the moon.
[01:00:37.899 --> 01:00:39.581]  And he took some of the most famous photos.
[01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:40.782]  The bio goes on and on.
[01:00:40.802 --> 01:00:43.604]  We'll talk about some of that while he's on with us.
[01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:57.183]  The main reason he's on today, and we're very honored to have him, is that he has been very outspoken, thank God, against global warming being man-made.
[01:00:57.543 --> 01:01:12.312]  We've had a lot of climatologists and a lot of researchers and sunspot experts in all these different fields, and 37,000 of them sent letters a few months ago to the House of Representatives, and they wouldn't even let them testify.
[01:01:14.554 --> 01:01:21.198]  The media ignored them, and then they used a few thousand scientists on the UN payroll to say we've got to totally change our way of life.
[01:01:21.518 --> 01:01:23.259]  Carbon dioxide is a deadly poison.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:33.386]  It's a national security issue, and astronaut Jack Schmidt has spoken out against that with his scientific training and PhD in geology from Harvard University.
[01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:37.631]  And all his other scientific research, and the bio goes on and on.
[01:01:38.171 --> 01:01:44.113]  And he reportedly took the famous photo of the marble, you know, blue marble of the Earth from the Moon.
[01:01:44.533 --> 01:01:45.753]  And so it's pretty neat to have him on.
[01:01:45.773 --> 01:01:48.154]  We're going to a break in a few minutes, but let's go ahead and introduce him.
[01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:49.855]  It's great to have you on, Mr. Schmidt.
[01:01:50.215 --> 01:01:53.176]  It's my pleasure and privilege to be with you today.
[01:01:54.436 --> 01:01:57.057]  I was flattered to learn that you've actually heard of the show before.
[01:01:57.817 --> 01:01:58.237]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:00.998]  We try to keep track out here.
[01:02:02.827 --> 01:02:04.207]  Well, Mr. Schmidt, it's great to have you.
[01:02:04.668 --> 01:02:08.349]  Let's just launch into man-made global warming.
[01:02:08.369 --> 01:02:13.651]  I mean, they were growing grapes thousands of years ago in Britain, but they're not now.
[01:02:13.751 --> 01:02:20.313]  All the evidence shows it gets hotter and colder, and Mars' ice caps get smaller, and then they get bigger.
[01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:21.313]  They're getting bigger again.
[01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:23.534]  Isn't it the sun, or am I wrong?
[01:02:24.194 --> 01:02:27.596]  Well, all the evidence is that there's a solar connection.
[01:02:27.696 --> 01:02:28.796]  The amplification
[01:02:30.137 --> 01:02:30.878]  I don't think so.
[01:02:59.969 --> 01:03:22.826]  Now, how small variations in solar irradiance are amplified into significant changes in ocean temperature, significant changes in atmospheric temperature, global cloud cover, and the like, is still, I would have to say, in the realm of hypotheses rather than theory.
[01:03:23.827 --> 01:03:27.310]  However, there's a very good hypothesis, and that is that
[01:03:28.516 --> 01:03:39.986]  It's the solar magnetic fields that vary with solar irradiance that are really determining the flux of cosmic rays into the atmosphere and therefore the amount of clouds that form.
[01:03:40.967 --> 01:03:42.408]  And they're forming what, the nuclei?
[01:03:42.428 --> 01:03:55.760]  Yeah, they form when they interact with molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere, you develop charged particles that then
[01:03:56.938 --> 01:04:00.561]  attract water vapor and become the nucleus for cloud formation.
[01:04:01.162 --> 01:04:11.291]  And when the sun is relatively inactive, for example, like it is right now, then the magnetic fields that protect us from cosmic rays are depressed.
[01:04:12.051 --> 01:04:21.279]  And you get more cosmic ray interaction with the atmosphere, more clouds, and therefore the clouds reflect more sunlight, and you end up with a cooling trend.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.902]  And we've had that, as most people in
[01:04:25.146 --> 01:04:26.067]  Yes, there's been a lot of record.
[01:04:26.087 --> 01:04:29.048]  But not just that, then the Al Gore people have been caught faking buoys and other
[01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:52.332]  Weather stations faking higher temperatures the last few years.
[01:04:53.112 --> 01:04:55.574]  Our guest is also the author of Return to the Moon.
[01:04:56.034 --> 01:04:57.134]  He's Harrison Schmitt.
[01:04:57.175 --> 01:04:58.235]  We're very honored to have him.
[01:04:59.055 --> 01:05:00.156]  He is an astronaut.
[01:05:00.536 --> 01:05:05.519]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:09.501]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.761 --> 01:05:10.201]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:15.363]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.663 --> 01:05:16.103]  It's true.
[01:05:16.303 --> 01:05:20.524]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.724 --> 01:05:21.245]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.645 --> 01:05:27.106]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:05:27.266 --> 01:05:27.767]  Number 4.
[01:05:27.927 --> 01:05:30.587]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:05:30.827 --> 01:05:34.269]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:34.489 --> 01:05:34.709]  Number 5.
[01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:38.970]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:44.693]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:06:00.865 --> 01:06:03.467]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.867 --> 01:06:08.830]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:10.931]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.251 --> 01:06:16.054]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.254 --> 01:06:17.194]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.435 --> 01:06:18.175]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.555 --> 01:06:20.156]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.436 --> 01:06:21.277]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.517 --> 01:06:23.578]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.718 --> 01:06:24.839]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.059 --> 01:06:26.360]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.962]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:06:29.123 --> 01:06:31.646]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.846 --> 01:06:35.049]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:38.934]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.254 --> 01:06:40.235]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.476 --> 01:06:41.096]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.377 --> 01:06:42.298]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:43.219]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.239 --> 01:06:44.220]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.263]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:47.543 --> 01:06:49.746]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:49.786 --> 01:06:50.767]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:01.423 --> 01:07:11.529]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:13.050]  Garden in a Can!
[01:07:13.411 --> 01:07:16.993]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.

[01:07:52.278 --> 01:07:52.318]  866-598-7396.
[01:08:01.954 --> 01:08:06.239]  Well, we're really lucky today for the rest of the hour.
[01:08:17.295 --> 01:08:26.541]  Harrison Schmitt, Jack Schmitt, American geologist, former NASA astronaut, university professor and former U.S.
[01:08:26.581 --> 01:08:31.985]  Senator, and he also, of course, walked on the moon on Apollo 17.
[01:08:32.145 --> 01:08:40.070]  And don't worry, we're going to talk about that before he leaves us today, but the big crisis at hand is the hoax, the
[01:08:41.431 --> 01:08:44.414]  The manufactured crisis of global warming.
[01:08:44.434 --> 01:08:46.055]  And I have Club of Rome documents, all that.
[01:08:46.075 --> 01:08:46.836]  We'll go over it with him.
[01:08:47.216 --> 01:08:54.442]  Where they admit this is just their pretext to turn us into the Soviet Union and micromanage the entire carbon cycle.
[01:08:54.782 --> 01:09:07.313]  But I guess a lot of people out there aren't biologists or aren't geologists and don't understand this, but he's here with us today to go over the science of that because he's bravely, because you get branded a heretic, come out against this hoax.
[01:09:07.953 --> 01:09:20.676]  And so, Dr. Smith, again, let's continue going into why you decided to go public and start talking about this whole carbon tax and the science behind supposed man-made global warming.
[01:09:22.417 --> 01:09:35.240]  Well, the primary reason that I and thousands of other observers of nature, if you will, I'm a field geologist, have become more active is our
[01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:37.046]  It's twofold.
[01:09:37.346 --> 01:09:53.033]  One is that we are concerned about the misuse of science, and particularly the misuse of modeling of a very complex system called climate that is so complex that it really can't be done.
[01:09:53.833 --> 01:10:02.796]  In fact, there are many people who are experts in modeling, astrophysicists and others, that have said the same thing.
[01:10:02.836 --> 01:10:04.177]  Freeman Dyson, for example.
[01:10:05.095 --> 01:10:05.836]  I don't know.
[01:10:18.044 --> 01:10:18.444]  I think so.
[01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:47.415]  Based predictions of the future on these extremely complex models that are filled with assumptions.
[01:10:47.475 --> 01:10:51.799]  So that, number one, we've been concerned about the misuse of science.
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:11:09.214]  But I think more fundamentally, this misuse of science has led to politicians and ideologues to try to gain control of the American economy.
[01:11:10.109 --> 01:11:13.850]  And indeed, the global economy, by scaring people.
[01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:25.072]  Now, the science is quite clear that there has been, since 1660, about a half a degree warming every hundred years.
[01:11:25.892 --> 01:11:39.414]  That is a natural cycle that represents the Earth coming out of what was called the Little Ice Age, an extremely cold period for the Earth, back in the
[01:11:40.222 --> 01:11:42.623]  Beginning about 1400.
[01:11:42.663 --> 01:11:56.830]  That, if you want to read some of the history of the American Revolutionary War, you will realize, like the book Sam Adams by McCullough, you realize how damn cold it was back then.
[01:11:57.170 --> 01:12:04.414]  And that was partly, we were just moving out of the Little Ice Age, very slowly, and it was still very cold.
[01:12:05.615 --> 01:12:08.216]  And so the natural warming is clearly happening,
[01:12:08.899 --> 01:12:22.871]  But there is absolutely no evidence, no observational evidence whatsoever that the increase in carbon dioxide that has been measured in the last 50 years has had anything to do with that.
[01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:30.238]  Primarily because the warming started before the Industrial Revolution ever began.
[01:12:30.258 --> 01:12:33.260]  Now, where is that carbon dioxide coming from?
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.023]  Well, it's probably coming mostly out of the oceans.
[01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:38.410]  Because the oceans are getting warmer.
[01:12:39.111 --> 01:12:54.155]  There's a lag in that process of the oceans giving up carbon dioxide as they warm, but nevertheless, and it can be a lag of a few centuries, but nevertheless, that's probably where most of that rise in CO2 is coming from.
[01:12:54.535 --> 01:13:03.657]  Well, we're talking to Harrison Smith, Dr. Harrison Smith, Jack Smith, one of the Apollo astronauts, walked to the moon, took the most famous photo, one of the most famous photos ever of the
[01:13:04.318 --> 01:13:06.480]  of the moon and the little blue marble out there.
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.202]  We're going to talk about that later, but you're a doctor in this.
[01:13:10.282 --> 01:13:13.524]  I'm just one who studies it and interviews scientists and people.
[01:13:14.165 --> 01:13:19.849]  But Al Gore got caught, according to all the ice core samples and people that I've interviewed and seen on television.
[01:13:20.606 --> 01:13:32.994]  He put the two, the carbon dioxide going up with the warming, when really the carbon dioxide comes after the warming, as you just said, that's from all the governments, all the universities, all the ocean studies, ice cores, correct?
[01:13:33.514 --> 01:13:49.284]  So that's more cooking the books, and then they've also caught some of the top global warming supporters, accidentally, and I put that in quotes, having false data from their weather stations and buoys jacking up numbers.
[01:13:50.224 --> 01:14:02.911]  So, I just don't see how they say it's an open and shut case when the majority of scientists polled out there say that it's completely natural and that man-made global warming is a fraud.
[01:14:03.992 --> 01:14:09.475]  Well, it is being used fraudulently, there's no question about it.
[01:14:10.735 --> 01:14:16.719]  And it's being used for political purposes and hopefully the American people have started to realize that.
[01:14:17.259 --> 01:14:19.260]  Certainly there are surveys that indicate that the
[01:14:19.735 --> 01:14:42.189]  The common sense of the American people on climate change is starting to take hold as it apparently is on health care revisions and the so-called stimulus package where there is a concerted effort in the new administration and the Congress that's supporting them and what one might call the state-run media
[01:14:42.935 --> 01:14:52.332]  to support them to move this country in directions that increase government control of just about every major facet of our lives.
[01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:55.231]  Absolutely.
[01:14:55.251 --> 01:15:01.294]  You know, they wouldn't let anybody see 300 pages of the 1,300 page bill until right when they voted on it.
[01:15:01.314 --> 01:15:02.074]  Now we have it.
[01:15:02.674 --> 01:15:07.636]  Home inspections, federal power to kick you out of your house if they want, take over all the land.
[01:15:07.656 --> 01:15:14.219]  It allows 30 plus federal agencies to just levy taxes and fines outside Congress's power.
[01:15:14.279 --> 01:15:23.463]  It's kind of a letter of mark just being given to any agency or group to go out and piratically shake down the public.
[01:15:25.319 --> 01:15:27.600]  Well, it's not encouraging.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:41.667]  Liberty is definitely threatened in this current political environment, and all of us who believe in liberty are going to have to begin to take steps to counter it.
[01:15:41.687 --> 01:15:50.712]  And it's encouraging to see the governors and the legislatures of a few states starting to push back in terms of gaining a
[01:15:53.554 --> 01:16:03.779]  Uh, a founder's interpretation of the 10th Amendment, namely that amendment that leaves everything not enumerated in the Constitution, uh, to the authority of the private sector or the state.
[01:16:05.159 --> 01:16:17.705]  Uh, and so, uh, that, that is, I think, a very, very encouraging trend and I certainly hope that they'll continue in that direction to at least try to put the brakes on, uh, the legal brakes, the constitutional brakes on what's happening.
[01:16:20.069 --> 01:16:21.090]  Well, I think you're right.
[01:16:21.170 --> 01:16:22.590]  I mean, the polls show you're right.
[01:16:23.051 --> 01:16:39.419]  That people are finally, you know, they've gone from 60-plus percent a few years ago believing man-made global warming was this big threat and we were all dead and carbon dioxide was deadly poison and would kill you in seconds, to now realizing that it is a fraud and a hoax and just a new tax.
[01:16:40.219 --> 01:16:43.621]  Now they've only got about 40% support and that's imploding quickly.
[01:16:44.061 --> 01:16:47.903]  But it seems like the federal government and, as you said, the state-controlled media, the big corporate media,
[01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:51.692]  They want this new tax, they want this control, and they don't care.
[01:16:51.712 --> 01:16:54.073]  It looks like they're going to just ram it through, maybe.
[01:16:55.454 --> 01:16:56.895]  Well, we'll see.
[01:16:57.936 --> 01:17:09.643]  There's a lot of resistance that's pushed back now, and the August recess should help us as the common sense of the American people is put forward to their representatives.
[01:17:09.743 --> 01:17:13.605]  And we'll just see how we come out of this particular period.
[01:17:14.726 --> 01:17:17.227]  You mentioned the corporate media.
[01:17:17.468 --> 01:17:17.928]  I would not
[01:17:18.476 --> 01:17:28.823]  I don't necessarily blame it on it being corporate media, it's just media that's in the tank for this change, socialistic change in our political system.
[01:17:29.683 --> 01:17:44.573]  And it's because just about everybody in the media now, reporters, analysts and otherwise, have come out of an elementary, secondary and college education.
[01:17:45.678 --> 01:17:52.542]  That has been dominated by people who have less respect for liberty than you and I. Well, yes, sir.
[01:17:52.562 --> 01:17:56.383]  Again, we're talking to astronaut, Apollo astronaut, Dr. Schmidt.
[01:17:57.504 --> 01:18:03.427]  My point was Rex Tillis and ExxonMobil said, look, we've looked at this.
[01:18:03.447 --> 01:18:04.988]  This is just a tax on oil.
[01:18:05.768 --> 01:18:06.609]  This is a fraud.
[01:18:06.909 --> 01:18:10.991]  And then David Rockefeller, the majority owner at a board meeting, this was in the news, said, you're going to
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:12.960]  Come out and say it's real.
[01:18:13.381 --> 01:18:16.061]  And so even Rex Tillerson came out and said, OK, it's real.
[01:18:16.121 --> 01:18:24.644]  So when you see the NFL and every other big organization pushing it, when in the American Football League is the National Football League is pushing it.
[01:18:25.164 --> 01:18:26.825]  We know the establishments behind it.
[01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:30.846]  Are you saying that that's just the incredible peer pressure and hype?
[01:18:31.887 --> 01:18:36.448]  Or is some scientists are saying this is the new global religion?
[01:18:36.488 --> 01:18:38.409]  This is the new organizing force.
[01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:52.997]  Well, it has certain characteristics of a religion in that there's a great amount of faith that the climate modelers have the right answer.
[01:18:54.518 --> 01:19:07.405]  But it is also, I think, related to a much longer term ideological battle that's been going on far before climate change came along.
[01:19:12.675 --> 01:19:34.320]  It's an ideological battle of those that believe that you should maximize human liberty under certain guidelines, such as our Constitution, and those who feel that you should give up human liberty for a variety of their particular ideological reasons.
[01:19:35.785 --> 01:19:36.985]  Well, I agree with you, Dr. Schmidt.
[01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:37.625]  We're about to break.
[01:19:37.645 --> 01:19:41.526]  We'll come back and get into some other issues as well, like health care with you.
[01:19:41.766 --> 01:19:46.367]  Then, of course, get into the moon itself and what it's like to be an astronaut who's been off the planet.
[01:19:49.588 --> 01:19:53.929]  I guess you're amongst people who've been the farthest away from the Earth of anybody else in the world.
[01:19:54.929 --> 01:19:57.509]  I know your mission was supposedly there the longest, right?
[01:19:57.529 --> 01:19:59.950]  If I'm not quoting that wrong.
[01:20:01.411 --> 01:20:06.737]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:20:07.457 --> 01:20:12.803]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:20:13.323 --> 01:20:19.490]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:21.651]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:20:21.791 --> 01:20:24.172]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:35.196]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:20:37.436 --> 01:20:38.717]  It's not about left or right.
[01:20:39.117 --> 01:20:40.497]  It's about a one-world government.

[01:20:56.159 --> 01:20:57.302]  The Obama Deception.
[01:20:57.743 --> 01:20:58.925]  The people strike back!
[01:21:00.504 --> 01:21:00.944]  Gold.
[01:21:01.284 --> 01:21:02.585]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:08.906]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:09.106 --> 01:21:12.907]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:13.267 --> 01:21:15.148]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:17.508]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:17.648 --> 01:21:24.550]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and
[01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:25.631]  We're good to go.

[01:24:08.824 --> 01:24:14.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was having an amazing conversation just now with Dr. Schmidt, Apollo astronaut.
[01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:17.073]  We're going to get into all the space stuff in the next segment.
[01:24:17.593 --> 01:24:24.620]  And I brought up to him Ecoscience, Population, Resources and Environment by John P. Holdren, the White House
[01:24:26.463 --> 01:24:32.428]  Science czar, the guy that wants global warming taxes and to terraform the earth with particulate to save us.
[01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:33.910]  I mean, this is wild stuff.
[01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:37.593]  I mean, here's the Wall Street Journal saying they want to chemtrail us.
[01:24:37.653 --> 01:24:39.695]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[01:24:40.756 --> 01:24:44.058]  Sir, we were talking during the break, what do you liken this to?
[01:24:44.119 --> 01:24:47.441]  This saying, drug the water supply, sterilize the men and women.
[01:24:47.481 --> 01:24:50.104]  He says in this book, take all the children at birth,
[01:24:50.584 --> 01:24:55.727]  Well, I think that there are individuals, apparently among them, who
[01:25:17.079 --> 01:25:33.250]  And a very large number who have taken the environment, shall we say, captured the environmental movement and turned it into what previously was considered a communist movement.
[01:25:34.391 --> 01:25:45.579]  And that's just something that people of common sense are going to have to continue to counter and wake up enough so that they take control of their government again.
[01:25:47.338 --> 01:25:56.503]  It certainly is extremely important that the United States maintain itself as the beacon of liberty on this planet.
[01:25:57.504 --> 01:26:09.411]  There are all sorts of issues, space is included in that, where if we are not taking a leadership role in preserving liberty, then it will disappear.
[01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:14.374]  Because other nations have so far tolerated
[01:26:15.413 --> 01:26:18.756]  Well, Dr., you're obviously very well-led.
[01:26:31.716 --> 01:26:32.457]  Absolutely, Bob.
[01:26:32.577 --> 01:26:35.519]  I mean, Doctor, you're obviously very well read on just the current news.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:45.908]  I'm sure you've seen the announcements where they're saying, oh, we're going to have a new Bank of the World, you're going to pay your carbon taxes, a new world order.
[01:26:46.448 --> 01:26:52.373]  Al Gore called for a world government two weeks ago to, quote, administer the environmental movement.
[01:26:52.734 --> 01:26:54.555]  I mean, clearly, that's what Holdren says.
[01:26:54.615 --> 01:26:59.519]  He says a planetary government to micromanage and reduce our numbers by at least 80 percent
[01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:03.955]  What is your view on that?
[01:27:04.235 --> 01:27:06.417]  And when you were in government as a U.S.
[01:27:06.457 --> 01:27:09.179]  Senator, did you ever hear any talk like this?
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.341]  Or is this starting to gain steam now?
[01:27:12.062 --> 01:27:15.785]  I think it has been gaining steam.
[01:27:15.825 --> 01:27:23.932]  You saw a little of it in my time in the Senate back in the late 70s and early 80s.
[01:27:24.412 --> 01:27:31.558]  Partisanship was beginning to really raise its ugly head more extensively than ever, at least in modern times.
[01:27:33.501 --> 01:27:51.886]  But it has clearly taken off in recent decades, I think primarily because of the capture of the government school system by the opponents of liberty.
[01:27:53.327 --> 01:27:57.608]  And that is, I think, the fundamental reason why we are today.
[01:27:59.315 --> 01:28:07.762]  Does that mean that common sense has totally disappeared from the American people due to the education and the elementary and secondary school system?
[01:28:09.063 --> 01:28:17.190]  I don't think so, because you still see, particularly in current surveys, a great deal of common sense reappearing.
[01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:24.315]  But on the other hand, that has to be sufficient to take back control of the government.
[01:28:24.676 --> 01:28:26.197]  We let ourselves be lulled
[01:28:26.923 --> 01:28:50.230]  A sweep in the last election cycle, the last two election cycles, until all of a sudden we have a president and a majority in both houses of Congress that think identically about these matters and are willing to try to force down our throats a further erosion of American liberty.
[01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:52.590]  I notice, Dr. Smith...
[01:28:55.254 --> 01:28:59.578]  Decimation of our government-run school system.
[01:29:00.679 --> 01:29:08.166]  I think the American people are showing human common sense and saying, hey, this isn't going to work.
[01:29:08.687 --> 01:29:11.649]  It never has and it won't work in the future and let's fix it.
[01:29:12.190 --> 01:29:16.674]  So we'll just have to continue to see if that common sense will prevail.
[01:29:17.441 --> 01:29:21.749]  Well, how obvious is it that all these other countries don't have to make carbon cuts?
[01:29:21.769 --> 01:29:28.222]  I mean, even if you believe in global warming and carbon dioxide is deadly, which is ridiculous, you know, trying to list it as a toxic waste.
[01:29:29.329 --> 01:29:35.270]  If we make the cuts, the businesses will just move to China and India and Mexico, and it'll boost carbon.
[01:29:35.710 --> 01:29:37.830]  I mean, it's just ridiculous any way you slice it.
[01:29:38.051 --> 01:29:43.912]  I want to get your take on that, Dr. Schmidt, Apollo astronaut on the other side, and we'll get into space technology.
[01:29:43.932 --> 01:29:44.852]  Should we go to the moon?
[01:29:45.132 --> 01:29:45.772]  Go to Mars?
[01:29:46.192 --> 01:29:46.872]  What's next?
[01:29:47.412 --> 01:29:49.032]  Why haven't we gone back in 40 years?
[01:29:49.052 --> 01:29:49.873]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.133 --> 01:29:52.073]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.533 --> 01:29:54.153]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.053 --> 01:29:57.734]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:05.497]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:05.637 --> 01:30:10.023]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:10.163 --> 01:30:12.006]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:30:12.446 --> 01:30:13.808]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:30:14.068 --> 01:30:15.090]  There is a solution.
[01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:23.355]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:30:23.755 --> 01:30:30.819]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:30:37.243 --> 01:30:42.826]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:30:43.246 --> 01:30:47.069]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:31:00.353 --> 01:31:04.336]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:31:04.577 --> 01:31:06.378]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:31:06.598 --> 01:31:14.885]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:31:15.105 --> 01:31:20.330]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:22.291]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:31:22.892 --> 01:31:28.834]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:31:29.034 --> 01:31:39.778]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:31:40.078 --> 01:31:40.598]  That's right.
[01:31:40.858 --> 01:31:43.159]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:31:43.419 --> 01:31:44.999]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8111.
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:47.601]  We're good to go.
[01:32:00.785 --> 01:32:04.128]  Friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Calvin Soap.
[01:32:04.268 --> 01:32:07.790]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap.

[01:33:06.241 --> 01:33:07.962]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:08.643]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:09.583]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:09.603 --> 01:33:10.024]  We're here.
[01:33:10.044 --> 01:33:10.844]  I come back Sundays.
[01:33:10.884 --> 01:33:12.145]  Abbreviated live show.
[01:33:12.165 --> 01:33:13.085]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:13.526 --> 01:33:14.626]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:15.687 --> 01:33:20.710]  And parts of the show are re-aired on XM Radio and a lot of other AM and FM affiliates across the country.
[01:33:21.091 --> 01:33:23.512]  We're very thankful to all those great affiliates out there.
[01:33:24.453 --> 01:33:27.695]  We're talking to Harrison Hagen-Schmidt or Jack Smith.
[01:33:28.607 --> 01:33:32.590]  He's an American geologist, former NASA astronaut, university professor, and former U.S.
[01:33:32.610 --> 01:33:32.971]  Senator.
[01:33:33.471 --> 01:33:36.734]  He is the last of the Apollo astronauts to arrive and set foot on the moon.
[01:33:36.754 --> 01:33:45.040]  And he is also the first, and so far only, person to have walked on the moon, who has never been a member of the United States Armed Forces.
[01:33:46.041 --> 01:33:49.043]  Neil Armstrong left military service, and it just goes through some of that trivia.
[01:33:49.524 --> 01:33:52.146]  And he's got a book, Return to the Moon, that's up on
[01:33:52.967 --> 01:33:58.488]  Screen in the Human Settlement of Space, Return to the Moon, is the name of the book.
[01:33:58.508 --> 01:34:00.969]  You can find it on Amazon and bookstores everywhere.
[01:34:00.989 --> 01:34:02.449]  In fact, I've even seen it in the bookstore.
[01:34:02.849 --> 01:34:04.109]  I've even seen it in my dad's house.
[01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:07.390]  But the point is, write a book, be sure, and get that.
[01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:17.052]  Just to modify one thing you said, I was the only non-military trained pilot.
[01:34:18.888 --> 01:34:27.732]  To go to the moon, but I did receive outstanding training from the United States Air Force in jet aircraft and the United States Navy in helicopters.
[01:34:27.812 --> 01:34:31.154]  So I feel like I sort of had the best of all worlds.
[01:34:31.594 --> 01:34:32.455]  Well there you go.
[01:34:32.575 --> 01:34:38.998]  I keep telling my guys don't print me Wikipedia stuff because Wikipedia's got my name spelled wrong and half of it's not true about me.
[01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:44.741]  I hope your audience recognizes that Wikipedia has their biases as well.
[01:34:45.421 --> 01:34:47.222]  Try to get anything in there to
[01:34:49.006 --> 01:34:51.969]  Moderate their position on climate change is impossible.
[01:34:52.049 --> 01:34:54.671]  A number of people have tried to do it and it just doesn't happen.
[01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:56.633]  I was just joking too.
[01:34:56.693 --> 01:34:57.914]  It's actually not from Wikipedia.
[01:34:57.934 --> 01:35:00.636]  The guys are about to box me in the nose in there.
[01:35:01.396 --> 01:35:03.438]  Yeah, Wikipedia won't let you publish.
[01:35:03.718 --> 01:35:12.525]  I've talked to scientists who've tried any material basically trying to debunk man-made global warming in just one case I found and
[01:35:14.235 --> 01:35:19.397]  It's just despicable because they're the first thing that comes up with almost any scientific inquiry.
[01:35:19.417 --> 01:35:20.297]  Have you noticed that, Doctor?
[01:35:20.317 --> 01:35:20.877]  Yeah.
[01:35:22.338 --> 01:35:26.579]  Yeah, it's, uh, well, Google's in that game as well, you know.
[01:35:27.399 --> 01:35:30.820]  The head of Google has a very close relationship with the President.
[01:35:33.181 --> 01:35:33.982]  I have seen that.
[01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:41.264]  Now, I want to get a little bit more into the environmental moment and then into the moon and the time we have left with you and also health care, but dealing with
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:49.527]  Holdren's book and all these other books written by people that just cram the universities and academia and social planning.
[01:35:51.509 --> 01:35:59.517]  This talk about the world being overpopulated when the West is actually, as you know, has a huge decline in its actual indigenous numbers.
[01:36:00.658 --> 01:36:13.129]  And dealing with this whole eugenics movement, this whole idea of the super race, I can't think of anybody out there who would be the archetypal Superman if it isn't the astronauts.
[01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:17.894]  I mean, did they ever talk to you guys about this type of stuff?
[01:36:17.954 --> 01:36:18.674]  Or when you were in the U.S.
[01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:22.117]  Senate, you said it seems to be building more steam now.
[01:36:23.158 --> 01:36:24.760]  Holdren and these guys are talking about
[01:36:25.359 --> 01:36:49.570]  Well, I'm concerned about any movement that might have legs to it, but I really think it is more visible now because the people who think this way have gained power.
[01:36:50.913 --> 01:36:57.017]  It does not mean that they are going to be supported by the vast majority of the American people.
[01:36:57.177 --> 01:37:05.241]  I just think you have to continue, as the founders did, to put your faith in the people and their common sense.
[01:37:05.341 --> 01:37:13.665]  Now, thanks to Talk Radio, they are getting some education that they would not have gotten otherwise.
[01:37:13.866 --> 01:37:16.507]  And it's up to you guys to expand your market.
[01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:29.738]  And to make sure that the American people overall begin to understand why their common sense is what they should rely on and not on what they're told by the national media, the state-run media, so to speak.
[01:37:30.679 --> 01:37:41.846]  Now, I think the whole trend really began with the fall of the Soviet Union, because the great champion of
[01:37:43.842 --> 01:37:46.363]  Yeah, and really what these are
[01:38:13.627 --> 01:38:14.507]  is parasites.
[01:38:14.547 --> 01:38:16.988]  I mean, they want to organize our lives, they want to run our lives.
[01:38:17.268 --> 01:38:23.651]  I'll never forget back in the mid-nineties, they were stealing farmers' and ranchers' land in and around Austin in the name of environmentalism.
[01:38:23.691 --> 01:38:25.951]  They later built on it and sold it to themselves.
[01:38:25.971 --> 01:38:27.432]  They were just bank robbers, criminals.
[01:38:27.952 --> 01:38:32.314]  And I remember being in a meeting with these city council advisors, and I said, this isn't freedom.
[01:38:32.334 --> 01:38:34.174]  And they said, everything's a planned economy.
[01:38:34.694 --> 01:38:35.995]  You know, somebody's got to do it.
[01:38:36.315 --> 01:38:39.296]  I mean, they really think it's their job to run our lives.
[01:38:39.636 --> 01:38:41.777]  How do we beat the forces of tyranny?
[01:38:42.711 --> 01:38:51.755]  Well, you have to do it by education, and by reminding the American people that their basic common sense instincts are correct.
[01:38:51.815 --> 01:38:59.939]  Their own private property is important, their incomes are important, and they should not transfer that to the government.
[01:39:01.559 --> 01:39:08.822]  Their first chance to express themselves politically is coming up in the next congressional election.
[01:39:11.204 --> 01:39:12.064]  You all and
[01:39:12.731 --> 01:39:32.260]  All of us have to try to mobilize the most massive turnout of people who reject this current approach and begin to turn it around and get back to what would be the basic fundamental principles of constitutional government that we were founded upon.
[01:39:33.123 --> 01:39:43.512]  Well, I noticed you mentioned the last few administrations being a problem, and so I'm glad you're recognizing, obviously, that both parties are run by these special interests.
[01:39:44.152 --> 01:39:48.035]  Why would big, wealthy interests want to collectivize things?
[01:39:48.095 --> 01:39:51.838]  Is that because it creates monopolies, allows them to shut down their competition?
[01:39:51.878 --> 01:39:55.962]  I mean, it's not just a bunch of hippies and communists running around that are doing this.
[01:39:55.982 --> 01:39:58.063]  They've got a lot of powerful friends.
[01:39:59.204 --> 01:40:00.806]  Well, there's no question there's a lot of
[01:40:01.952 --> 01:40:04.653]  Of money influence in this process.
[01:40:08.114 --> 01:40:17.416]  And I don't know what's motivating people who have basically been dependent on a free enterprise system to get where they are today.
[01:40:17.896 --> 01:40:26.138]  Now clearly, small business, medium-sized business, the kind of business that I'm involved in in various ways, they do not operate that way.
[01:40:26.978 --> 01:40:29.359]  But there are, particularly in the media,
[01:40:30.183 --> 01:40:55.340]  An entertainment world, major corporations who have bought into and believe that their future is going to be tied to, their economic future, tied to this approach to attacking liberty and to building a more socialistic approach to providing for the needs of the American people.
[01:40:56.712 --> 01:40:59.894]  That is a very dangerous trend, there's no question about it.
[01:40:59.914 --> 01:41:15.641]  It's made it even worse by the way we've allowed the Congress not only to become permanent fixtures, very few Congressmen and Senators, if they run for re-election, ever get defeated.
[01:41:17.042 --> 01:41:21.584]  And that's in large part because the federal election laws have been
[01:41:24.352 --> 01:41:30.575]  Well, Dr. Schmidt, Apollo astronaut, Apollo 18 astronaut, I
[01:41:54.042 --> 01:42:00.227]  I'm sure you've probably seen the Cyberbullying Act, and even got local newscasts pushing it now, the press is that bad.
[01:42:00.607 --> 01:42:10.895]  The Hate Crimes Act, it now says if your speech causes someone to do something violent, even if you're not calling for violence, they're going to come arrest you.
[01:42:11.756 --> 01:42:19.482]  And now the FBI is fluttering around saying if somebody makes a comment on a message board that's yours, we may come after you for what they said.
[01:42:19.502 --> 01:42:23.025]  I mean, this is really happening to people I know.
[01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:30.534]  Well, that's why we've got to make a change of direction in the United States government, a drastic change.
[01:42:31.955 --> 01:42:37.778]  And as I say, the next election is the key turning point.
[01:42:38.019 --> 01:42:41.541]  The next two elections are particularly key.
[01:42:42.001 --> 01:42:53.088]  If the powers that are currently in Washington maintain their control through this next election, the next two elections, then I'm not sure how you turn it around.
[01:42:54.153 --> 01:43:00.198]  Okay, in the 16 minutes or so we have left with you, I want to shift gears now and get into the moon.
[01:43:00.518 --> 01:43:06.683]  Return to the Moon, it has that really great other headline here about colonizing.
[01:43:06.703 --> 01:43:08.845]  In fact, guys, put that up on screen for the TV viewers.
[01:43:08.865 --> 01:43:10.806]  I don't think you use that word.
[01:43:10.866 --> 01:43:12.067]  I think I use settling.
[01:43:12.748 --> 01:43:15.470]  Sure, that's why I wanted to put it up on the screen so I could actually... There it is.
[01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:18.272]  The Human Settlement of Space, Return to the Moon.
[01:43:18.332 --> 01:43:20.694]  Tell us what that headline means for the book.
[01:43:21.755 --> 01:43:22.716]  Well, the...
[01:43:24.741 --> 01:43:30.442]  The Moon is the nearest place in space where human beings can homestead.
[01:43:31.762 --> 01:43:49.806]  The resources are there to once settlements are established, the resources are there not only to support those settlements with the water and oxygen and food and other things that you need, independently of the Earth, but
[01:43:50.871 --> 01:44:02.295]  There is one resource that's there that allows for an economy that can, through the export of that resource, to the Earth.
[01:44:02.435 --> 01:44:09.537]  And that's a light isotope of helium called Helium-3, which is a nearly ideal fuel for fusion power generation.
[01:44:10.618 --> 01:44:13.039]  And so that's what the book is all about.
[01:44:13.079 --> 01:44:16.480]  It tries to put together, in a very, very broad way,
[01:44:18.969 --> 01:44:29.597]  Amazing.
[01:44:30.458 --> 01:44:41.346]  Now, just because your bio is so lengthy, in a nutshell, tell us about your career as a AAA astronaut, you know, lunar astronaut.
[01:44:41.806 --> 01:44:42.707]  Tell us about that.
[01:44:42.867 --> 01:44:43.807]  Tell us about the missions.
[01:44:44.108 --> 01:44:45.789]  Just in a nutshell, then I've got some questions.
[01:44:47.130 --> 01:44:57.333]  Well, my career started as a geologist, the son of a geologist actually, in southern New Mexico.
[01:44:57.753 --> 01:45:00.354]  Caltech trained and then a Harvard PhD.
[01:45:01.014 --> 01:45:03.335]  I did a lot of field work in Norway and Alaska.
[01:45:04.195 --> 01:45:15.059]  And when NASA and the National Academy of Sciences asked for volunteers for the first selection of scientist astronauts, I thought about 10 seconds and raised my hand.
[01:45:15.925 --> 01:45:19.147]  And figuring that if I didn't, I'd probably regret it.
[01:45:19.408 --> 01:45:20.588]  And I would have, obviously.
[01:45:21.349 --> 01:45:39.422]  But while at Harvard, I became increasingly concerned about the direction that Harvard-trained so-called public servants were taking us, and figured that if I was that concerned, that sometime in my life I'd better think about getting into politics.
[01:45:40.082 --> 01:45:42.604]  That opportunity came after my astronaut career,
[01:45:43.534 --> 01:45:46.076]  I had essentially been completed.
[01:45:47.116 --> 01:45:48.757]  I was elected to the United States Senate.
[01:45:49.258 --> 01:45:54.081]  Spent six years there learning a great deal about how sausage is made.
[01:45:55.141 --> 01:45:59.904]  More than most people would like to know, I think.
[01:46:00.124 --> 01:46:05.408]  And then, in the middle of the depression of the recession of 1982, I lost my seat.
[01:46:09.868 --> 01:46:23.135]  Here in New Mexico and went into an accelerated learning experience in the private sector and free enterprise and business related activities.
[01:46:23.576 --> 01:46:27.578]  Well that's awesome and again the book is Return to the Moon available everywhere.
[01:46:28.478 --> 01:46:29.739]  Harrison Smith is our guest.
[01:46:30.179 --> 01:46:32.340]  How many moon missions were you involved in in total?
[01:46:32.761 --> 01:46:38.264]  Well I was involved in essentially all the moon missions but I only flew on Apollo 17.
[01:46:39.742 --> 01:46:41.263]  The last of the Apollo series.
[01:46:43.645 --> 01:46:48.409]  My involvement in other missions was multifaceted.
[01:46:48.729 --> 01:46:58.697]  I was primarily responsible for setting up the lunar science and geological science training program for the pilot astronauts.
[01:46:59.638 --> 01:47:06.303]  I was responsible for overseeing for the astronaut office the development of various scientific experiments.
[01:47:11.284 --> 01:47:14.805]  And you also, as you said, discovered a lot of the most important rocks.
[01:47:16.186 --> 01:47:21.168]  Which mission put that laser up that the University of Texas contacts?
[01:47:21.908 --> 01:47:26.129]  It was actually deployed on the moon three different times.
[01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:32.452]  The first one by Apollo 11, as a matter of fact, 40 years ago, was a reflector.
[01:47:36.938 --> 01:47:49.986]  Uh, observatories now shoot that, those reflectors, the three of them, that were finally deployed, with laser beams, and have been able to, uh, very, very precisely determine... Distance.
[01:47:50.406 --> 01:47:53.708]  ...from the Earth to the Moon, as well as the motions of the continent.
[01:47:54.921 --> 01:47:58.684]  All right, we're running down on time and you've agreed to come back on in the future on science issues.
[01:47:58.704 --> 01:48:10.515]  It's just amazing having you, but I will be broiled and skewered and drawn and quartered and hung and then tanned if I don't bring this up because we talk about hoaxes.
[01:48:10.555 --> 01:48:15.840]  We have this giant government hoax of global warming right now, clearly trying to get control.
[01:48:17.521 --> 01:48:27.374]  Before I ask this, I want to say I have a friend, Raymond Teague, who worked on the main mission control on repeated Apollos, ran RCA cameras, and then RCA cameras on Skylab.
[01:48:27.955 --> 01:48:32.782]  And I've known Raymond for 14 years, and he says the whole thing's real.
[01:48:32.862 --> 01:48:33.663]  None of it's faked.
[01:48:34.201 --> 01:48:36.582]  You know, the whole nine yards, and I know he's the real deal.
[01:48:37.062 --> 01:48:45.483]  I have other people I know being here in Texas who worked on the mission, and they say, if there was any chicanery, then they were conning us too, and that's pretty darn hard to do.
[01:48:45.603 --> 01:48:51.945]  Forty years later, and I never really cover this issue, but I get calls every day, emails about it, TV shows everywhere.
[01:48:52.265 --> 01:49:02.827]  What is your take on the people more and more believing, I've seen polls as high as 30%, that aspects of the whole thing was faked?
[01:49:04.124 --> 01:49:10.969]  Well, I think in a serious vein that it is another reflection on the government-run school system.
[01:49:11.009 --> 01:49:12.570]  That system does not teach history.
[01:49:14.291 --> 01:49:22.397]  There are several generations now who have come through it that have had very little exposure to American history or world history in an objective way.
[01:49:23.358 --> 01:49:33.685]  And right now you have a population that has not learned the complexities that had to be
[01:49:34.321 --> 01:49:35.022]  We're good to go.
[01:49:56.784 --> 01:50:01.046]  But in a way that, I mean, that's a positive thing to not be totally trusting.
[01:50:01.066 --> 01:50:02.046]  The founders said that.
[01:50:02.466 --> 01:50:04.687]  I think a lot of it's so much government lying.
[01:50:05.307 --> 01:50:08.369]  People are so untrusting now, they don't even trust me on a lot of issues.
[01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:10.109]  I mean, people don't trust their neighbors.
[01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:13.671]  And society does seem to be degenerating a bit.
[01:50:14.471 --> 01:50:19.273]  My only issue is, that said, that I know people that worked on the mission who say it was absolutely real.
[01:50:19.633 --> 01:50:22.114]  And you can watch famous films of them in mission control.
[01:50:22.134 --> 01:50:23.995]  People I know, they're not making it up.
[01:50:25.574 --> 01:50:34.181]  For a conspiracy like that to work, you would have to have conned 450,000 Americans.
[01:50:34.221 --> 01:50:35.642]  That's how many worked on the program.
[01:50:35.682 --> 01:50:37.823]  That's how many worked, and you just couldn't do it.
[01:50:37.883 --> 01:50:48.792]  Look, people have to remember that there's still, when you have a population of the world as large as we have, a very, very micro percentage is still a significant number.
[01:50:49.293 --> 01:50:52.155]  And some of those people actually still believe the Earth is black.
[01:50:53.119 --> 01:50:56.542]  So if a few of them want to believe that we didn't go to the moon, let them.
[01:50:57.263 --> 01:50:59.825]  It's not an issue that comes up in my presentation.
[01:51:04.795 --> 01:51:22.378]  Some flat earthers saying I'm covering up the fact that it's it's some Atlantean conspiracy but but the reason I mean obviously you know this is this has been building I would imagine you get asked that sometimes because there are issues that make people question and so let me just throw a few of those out to you.
[01:51:23.978 --> 01:51:24.898]  Wait a minute.
[01:51:25.899 --> 01:51:31.300]  I think there are more important things to talk about but just let me say that when I'm out talking to the public I do not get that question.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.580]  I only get that question from talk show hosts.
[01:51:38.214 --> 01:51:42.396]  And so I think we ought to spend our time on more important issues.
[01:51:42.436 --> 01:51:46.499]  Okay, why haven't we been back to the moon in 40 years?
[01:51:47.799 --> 01:52:07.050]  Well, that's a really long topic, but the most immediate is that even though George W. Bush articulated a very good return to the moon and on beyond policy, neither his budget office or the Congress
[01:52:07.836 --> 01:52:08.796]  Properly funded that.
[01:52:09.257 --> 01:52:13.958]  Had it been properly funded, we would be well on our way as we speak.
[01:52:14.578 --> 01:52:21.381]  But in the absence of adequate funding, we have had to flip schedules in order to keep the program alive.
[01:52:21.961 --> 01:52:34.385]  Now you have an administration that, for all indications, is not going to pursue an aggressive role for the United States in deep space.
[01:52:34.625 --> 01:52:36.606]  And they're going to leave that to the Chinese
[01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:40.291]  Uh, potentially the Indians and the Japanese and maybe Europe.
[01:52:41.211 --> 01:52:43.932]  Uh, and that I think is an extraordinary mistake.
[01:52:44.012 --> 01:52:50.275]  It's as big a mistake in the long term as we could make, uh, relative to protecting liberty here on this planet.
[01:52:50.875 --> 01:52:51.155]  Sure.
[01:52:51.175 --> 01:53:02.019]  If you have non-democratic regimes, uh, dominant in deep space, dominant on the moon and elsewhere, then it's going to be very, very difficult to continue to protect liberty on this, uh,
[01:53:02.912 --> 01:53:03.132]  Sure.
[01:53:03.412 --> 01:53:30.532]  Have you heard of, I guess you were in the Senate around that time, Dr. Bob Bowman, who worked on some of the Star Wars program before it was declassified in the early 80s, and he's saying, and he's told me, he said, look Alex, not only is there a space program, but there's a lot of it you don't know about and I can't tell you about it, but he's mentioned a few things that have slipped out or been declassified, you know, the whole robotic program, and they admit that a lot of the shuttles have been military secret missions.
[01:53:33.025 --> 01:53:33.585]  Not a lot.
[01:53:33.645 --> 01:53:46.309]  There have been a few Air Force missions, or missions of the space shuttle in which there were some classified payloads, but you shouldn't have a lot.
[01:53:46.589 --> 01:53:51.471]  All the shuttle flights, with very few exceptions, have been purely civilian flights.
[01:53:52.011 --> 01:53:52.211]  Sure.
[01:53:52.331 --> 01:53:55.552]  You did a lot of the photography on the moon, didn't you?
[01:53:56.352 --> 01:53:59.093]  Oh yeah, well both Gene Cernan and I had cameras,
[01:54:00.565 --> 01:54:03.408]  We took a lot of the pictures.
[01:54:03.528 --> 01:54:10.656]  I happened to be more active in taking pictures of the Earth as we went towards the moon.
[01:54:10.676 --> 01:54:13.058]  But you took the famous Blue Marble photo, didn't you?
[01:54:13.198 --> 01:54:16.402]  The full Earth that shows the continent of Africa in its entirety.
[01:54:16.582 --> 01:54:17.383]  That's one I took.
[01:54:17.803 --> 01:54:20.786]  I was about 34,000 miles away from Earth when I snapped that.
[01:54:24.757 --> 01:54:27.380]  Because people kill me if I don't ask, where are the stars?
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.303]  Is it because the Earth is so bright that it blots those out?
[01:54:31.723 --> 01:54:36.468]  Yes, it's the same problem you have on a sunny day here on Earth of seeing stars.
[01:54:37.048 --> 01:54:44.255]  There's just too much light for a wonderful optical system we call our eyes to handle.
[01:54:44.555 --> 01:54:51.421]  The eyes are great, but they do not have what scientists call a dynamic range to see both the bright surfaces and stars.
[01:54:52.148 --> 01:54:57.969]  Well, that's like when the moon is up at night, you can't see stars anywhere around it, right?
[01:54:58.249 --> 01:54:58.749]  That's correct.
[01:54:58.849 --> 01:54:59.330]  Same thing.
[01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:08.332]  The moon just dominates the eye, and the eye doesn't close down enough, doesn't close the iris enough to see the stars.
[01:55:10.672 --> 01:55:19.234]  Well, I know we've got advanced technologies, and I know the A-bomb and the hydrogen bomb and the superconducting super colliders are real, and I know that there are some
[01:55:20.197 --> 01:55:26.082]  Space plane programs, even if you say there aren't, Dr. Schmidt, that are going on.
[01:55:26.722 --> 01:55:32.107]  And so, that's why I believe in our potential, and I want to believe we went to the moon, and I believe you.
[01:55:32.127 --> 01:55:34.749]  You know, when you sit here, I mean, you sound very credible to me.
[01:55:34.769 --> 01:55:36.931]  I just, you say you don't get asses on the street.
[01:55:36.971 --> 01:55:38.352]  People are probably scared to ask you.
[01:55:38.952 --> 01:55:40.954]  I mean, I'm sure you've seen all over the news.
[01:55:41.094 --> 01:55:41.695]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:55:41.715 --> 01:55:44.837]  The American people are never scared to ask anybody a question.
[01:55:44.997 --> 01:55:45.778]  Believe me.
[01:55:47.062 --> 01:55:51.345]  Well, I mean, certainly you know it's a big, I mean, it's becoming a bigger controversy and that's why I brought it up.
[01:55:52.446 --> 01:55:53.146]  I understand.
[01:55:53.186 --> 01:55:54.587]  You have to deal with it.
[01:55:54.687 --> 01:55:55.608]  Fortunately, I don't.
[01:55:56.809 --> 01:56:06.256]  Well, I mean, I know you're right about the global warming being a hoax, and I mean, there's government and corporations engaged in a hoax, so I think that's, I mean, how do we fix this crisis of confidence?
[01:56:06.316 --> 01:56:10.739]  Because it's even happening not just with the government, as you know, it's happening with people in business now.
[01:56:11.599 --> 01:56:12.340]  How do we fix that?
[01:56:14.215 --> 01:56:21.899]  Well, I think you fix it by, again, people of common sense taking back control of their government and making them right.
[01:56:22.679 --> 01:56:25.180]  And getting good people to run for office.
[01:56:26.281 --> 01:56:30.162]  I personally would like to see term limits, but you're never going to get the Congress to do it.
[01:56:30.203 --> 01:56:34.545]  That's something the states are going to have to do if we're ever going to have a constitutional amendment.
[01:56:35.385 --> 01:56:38.046]  The founders just didn't realize that
[01:56:40.354 --> 01:56:44.499]  Their successors would make a career out of going into politics.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:48.262]  It would die on their visible horizon.
[01:56:48.523 --> 01:56:50.064]  Sure, we only have about two and a half minutes left.
[01:56:50.104 --> 01:56:59.414]  Dr. Schmidt, one word to describe what it's like to be 400,000 miles away, or less, from the Earth.
[01:56:59.954 --> 01:57:02.377]  One word to describe standing on another planet.
[01:57:03.057 --> 01:57:03.418]  Privilege.
[01:57:04.568 --> 01:57:08.950]  I was greatly honored and privileged to have an opportunity to do it, as were all of my colleagues.
[01:57:09.070 --> 01:57:12.971]  We were just the tip of the spear.
[01:57:12.991 --> 01:57:18.933]  450,000 Americans held that spear, and we just represented them on the moon, but they made it happen.
[01:57:20.613 --> 01:57:26.155]  And that is my last question on the issue, and then I will never bring it up to you again, I promise, if you join us again.
[01:57:27.016 --> 01:57:31.117]  How did the film make it back through the Van Allen radiation belt?
[01:57:32.216 --> 01:57:35.957]  Well, that belt doesn't have that much radiation.
[01:57:35.977 --> 01:57:38.717]  If it was going to damage the film, it would have damaged us.
[01:57:42.058 --> 01:57:49.180]  There is radiation there, and if you lingered in it over time, you could accumulate a dose that could be a problem.
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:54.421]  But we went through it so fast that there wasn't any significant dose on the film or on a
[01:57:55.663 --> 01:57:56.443]  Well, you know what's neat?
[01:57:56.463 --> 01:57:58.004]  We're starting to see space tourism.
[01:57:58.024 --> 01:58:02.805]  If they'd really give us a space program, some of us could live long enough to actually go to the moon.
[01:58:03.145 --> 01:58:06.546]  But pretty soon, they'll say the moon doesn't exist, and maybe it's made out of cheese.
[01:58:07.166 --> 01:58:11.307]  Let me tell you, Mr. Schmidt, Dr. Schmidt, Return to the Moon is the book.
[01:58:11.407 --> 01:58:15.888]  He's out there exposing global warming as the fraud it is, man-made global warming.
[01:58:16.428 --> 01:58:19.489]  Is there any websites to fire out, sir, or any other info?
[01:58:19.509 --> 01:58:24.990]  No, I think if people look at the book, Return to the Moon,
[01:58:25.951 --> 01:58:34.673]  Yeah, I'd like to have you back up in the next few months to just talk about the book itself and more about the moon.
[01:58:34.933 --> 01:58:37.894]  And thank you for entertaining those questions.
[01:58:38.474 --> 01:58:39.634]  Let me say bye to you here at the end.
[01:58:39.894 --> 01:58:40.574]  Retransmissions.

[01:58:50.984 --> 01:58:55.969]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:59.972]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.212 --> 01:59:05.817]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:06.118 --> 01:59:10.982]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.182 --> 01:59:11.683]  Number three,
[01:59:12.083 --> 01:59:17.530]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:59:18.391 --> 01:59:21.034]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:59:21.295 --> 01:59:25.500]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:29.425]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:59:29.645 --> 01:59:35.146]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:59:56.051 --> 01:59:58.832]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:10.067 --> 02:00:13.831]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're dropping, dropping the info bomb.
[02:00:13.871 --> 02:00:16.254]  We are now into the fourth hour today.
[02:00:16.674 --> 02:00:19.037]  Top Trends forecaster Gerald Cilente joins us.
[02:00:19.137 --> 02:00:21.299]  It is Wednesday, the 22nd day of July 2009.
[02:00:23.456 --> 02:00:28.200]  Don't forget the free podcast of the radio show available at InfoWars.com and the listen page.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:39.568]  Listen how you want, where you want, when you want, and please keep spreading the word about how you people can listen to the free internet streams, the internet archives, and podcasts again at PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.

[02:00:50.697 --> 02:00:51.858]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:52.876 --> 02:00:57.578]  Let us now go to... Who's up next here, John?
[02:00:59.579 --> 02:01:01.039]  Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:01:01.059 --> 02:01:02.200]  Go ahead, Ronnie.
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:03.360]  Thank you, sir.
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:06.342]  I'd like to thank Gerald Salente for his ideas before you get there.
[02:01:07.142 --> 02:01:08.863]  And I want to thank you for everything.
[02:01:08.883 --> 02:01:14.165]  Of course, you're getting to speak with your guest, Wayne Paul, was a special treat for me, but I forgot.
[02:01:14.185 --> 02:01:16.666]  I forgot to mention that
[02:01:17.301 --> 02:01:24.686]  The most important person of that Paul family I spoke to was his granddaughter, who approached me on the UT campus.
[02:01:24.726 --> 02:01:34.414]  I was carrying one of his signs, as usual, and she, again, thanked me for campaigning for him, and she told me that she was, of course, delivered by him, and then said, and I'm his granddaughter.
[02:01:34.454 --> 02:01:43.060]  So I've actually, and I don't know, like you, I think that maybe she told Dr. Paul about it, and like you, maybe I helped.
[02:01:43.996 --> 02:01:45.497]  Him to decide to run again.
[02:01:45.537 --> 02:01:47.678]  That's just maybe a delusion on my part.
[02:01:47.698 --> 02:01:50.059]  You also know Ron Paul's for real.
[02:01:50.139 --> 02:01:59.543]  That's why COINTELPRO attack him and ask where's the campaign money and this and that when it's all under the Federal Election Commission public.
[02:01:59.923 --> 02:02:01.904]  COINTELPRO is now attacking We Are Change.
[02:02:01.944 --> 02:02:03.905]  We Are Change isn't centralized.
[02:02:03.965 --> 02:02:10.608]  It's just a name, an idea that I promoted up front and exploded worldwide because the name was good.
[02:02:11.411 --> 02:02:24.516]  And they're trying to attack the New York Chapter because openly on this show, you the listeners, raise money for German Tallis, who they ran the wheelchair into and set up and he was found not guilty.
[02:02:24.896 --> 02:02:26.257]  So they're trying to spend that.
[02:02:27.966 --> 02:02:29.768]  But again, it's not working.
[02:02:30.588 --> 02:02:36.114]  And we're continuing to move forward and expose the New World Order, and the globalists absolutely hate it.
[02:02:36.614 --> 02:02:37.715]  And we're going to bring them to justice.
[02:02:37.735 --> 02:02:40.838]  So they love to nitpick on us all day, but we're not the New World Order.
[02:02:41.298 --> 02:02:47.925]  We're not the New World Order that is forcing you to pay taxes so they can use it to poison your water.
[02:02:48.986 --> 02:02:52.209]  And so the people are wise to that, and we're going to bring down the globalists.
[02:02:52.639 --> 02:02:53.319]  Well, you're right, sir.
[02:02:53.359 --> 02:02:59.521]  Can I just say a quote from Dr. Paul, his most recent American Free Press last paragraph?
[02:02:59.541 --> 02:03:04.342]  He said, "...public outcry against the bank value bailouts and the government power grab known as cap and trade brews.
[02:03:04.822 --> 02:03:12.844]  The spirit of liberty still lives, and part of the celebration of independence day should include a renewed determination to keep fighting a good fight for freedom."
[02:03:13.482 --> 02:03:17.865]  As long as the government continually seeks to take liberties away, patriots need to keep fighting.
[02:03:17.925 --> 02:03:20.046]  I hear you and I appreciate your call, Ronnie.
[02:03:20.066 --> 02:03:20.866]  I gotta jump there.
[02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:22.287]  Travis in Illinois.
[02:03:22.327 --> 02:03:23.188]  Travis, go ahead.
[02:03:23.208 --> 02:03:25.069]  Hello?
[02:03:25.749 --> 02:03:26.750]  Yes, go ahead, Travis.
[02:03:29.488 --> 02:03:33.171]  Let you know that your, uh, Obama Deception is an awesome film.
[02:03:33.311 --> 02:03:36.974]  It's the only reason I know anything about any of this.
[02:03:37.174 --> 02:03:39.296]  It's how I got awakened, as you might want to say.
[02:03:39.416 --> 02:03:39.616]  Good!
[02:03:39.656 --> 02:03:40.497]  So somebody woke you up.
[02:03:40.517 --> 02:03:42.498]  Did you see it on the internet or did somebody give you a DVD?
[02:03:43.119 --> 02:03:47.803]  Um, actually, I saw it on the internet while doing an English report on Obama.
[02:03:48.463 --> 02:03:52.987]  I, uh, my teacher thought I was doing something, you know, because I liked him.
[02:03:54.068 --> 02:03:55.229]  He found that out quickly.
[02:03:56.007 --> 02:03:56.247]  Good.
[02:03:56.347 --> 02:03:57.168]  Pay it forward.
[02:03:57.488 --> 02:04:00.349]  Tell your whole email list about the Obama Deception.
[02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:05.092]  The best one is the YouTube Director's Channel, where the whole film's in one piece.
[02:04:05.112 --> 02:04:06.733]  That's the best quality for free.
[02:04:07.654 --> 02:04:08.534]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:04:08.554 --> 02:04:10.755]  I've been sending links everywhere.
[02:04:11.256 --> 02:04:11.496]  Good.
[02:04:11.576 --> 02:04:13.697]  I just have a couple things to say.
[02:04:15.538 --> 02:04:20.181]  You know what the Marisol is and the vaccinations, the nursery-based preservative?
[02:04:20.701 --> 02:04:22.882]  I found out it's also in Contact Solution.
[02:04:22.922 --> 02:04:24.063]  I didn't know if you know that.
[02:04:24.914 --> 02:04:25.235]  Some.
[02:04:25.295 --> 02:04:26.937]  It's been phased out of most, yes.
[02:04:27.617 --> 02:04:29.880]  Well, I know the one I was using did have it in.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:31.281]  Bausch & Lohm?
[02:04:32.162 --> 02:04:32.382]  What?
[02:04:33.103 --> 02:04:33.924]  Bausch & Lohm?
[02:04:34.965 --> 02:04:47.078]  Um, I believe it was the Walmart brand at the time was using it, but I couldn't figure out why my contacts were so, or my eyes were so irritated, and I switched to the Walgreens brand, which
[02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:50.069]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:52.790]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:04:52.810 --> 02:04:53.790]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:57.611]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:04:58.491 --> 02:05:01.252]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.796 --> 02:05:18.537]  When do you want it?
[02:05:18.917 --> 02:05:20.518]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.799 --> 02:05:21.619]  When will you need it?
[02:05:21.879 --> 02:05:23.941]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.081 --> 02:05:25.182]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.422 --> 02:05:26.763]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:26.944 --> 02:05:32.008]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.208 --> 02:05:35.391]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.791 --> 02:05:39.274]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.614 --> 02:05:40.595]  How much will you need?
[02:05:40.836 --> 02:05:41.436]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.737 --> 02:05:42.638]  How much do you want?
[02:05:42.838 --> 02:05:43.599]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.779 --> 02:05:44.620]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:47.644]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:05:49.706 --> 02:05:50.607]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.316 --> 02:06:04.299]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:06.341]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:06:06.561 --> 02:06:14.848]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:20.313]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:06:20.653 --> 02:06:22.275]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:06:22.495 --> 02:06:28.836]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:06:29.016 --> 02:06:39.759]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:40.579]  That's right.
[02:06:40.839 --> 02:06:43.139]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:06:43.399 --> 02:06:44.980]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.

[02:08:02.927 --> 02:08:08.949]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:12.590]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:21.672]  Well, he is a frequent contributor on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox, BBC, Russian television, you name it.
[02:08:22.441 --> 02:08:26.663]  And he's been making a lot of amazing predictions over the last 20-plus years as a trends forecaster.
[02:08:27.283 --> 02:08:29.244]  Before that, of course, he's also a best-selling author.
[02:08:29.804 --> 02:08:32.366]  Before that, he worked in some of the biggest political campaigns in the country.
[02:08:32.726 --> 02:08:36.587]  He's also one of the main contributors in the film, The Obama Deception.
[02:08:36.647 --> 02:08:38.868]  He's trends forecaster Gerald Solente.
[02:08:38.889 --> 02:08:41.810]  He's also in the new Obama film coming out in October.
[02:08:42.490 --> 02:08:47.912]  This film shows how both parties are controlled by the same interests, this gangster government, this takeover.
[02:08:48.292 --> 02:08:50.052]  We'll be talking to Gerald about that right now.
[02:08:50.412 --> 02:08:54.754]  Please get The Obama Deception at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:59.202 --> 02:09:04.367]  And if you can't afford the DVD with the extras and the high quality to show your friends and family and make copies from, that's fine.
[02:09:04.868 --> 02:09:06.429]  Just Google the Obama Deception.
[02:09:06.770 --> 02:09:08.231]  Look for the third or fourth link down.
[02:09:08.572 --> 02:09:10.594]  That's the best version I found on YouTube.
[02:09:11.034 --> 02:09:12.115]  It's a director's channel.
[02:09:12.415 --> 02:09:13.757]  It's got about 3 million views.
[02:09:14.437 --> 02:09:16.339]  All total, it's over 20 million views online.
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:18.802]  And pass that link out to everybody.
[02:09:19.042 --> 02:09:22.686]  But again, get this, have this on your shelf, show it to everybody.
[02:09:23.506 --> 02:09:26.587]  People see it and it's like it's pressing it because we show everything he was going to do.
[02:09:26.607 --> 02:09:28.867]  This came out one month into him in office.
[02:09:29.347 --> 02:09:31.407]  And it's all chronicled in the Obama deception.
[02:09:32.508 --> 02:09:35.728]  Going now to Gerald Solente for the next 51 minutes.
[02:09:36.068 --> 02:09:38.029]  We'll take your calls at the bottom of the hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:09:38.089 --> 02:09:44.290]  Gerald Solente, you've got the floor.
[02:09:44.330 --> 02:09:51.071]  The mainstream media more than ever is taking notice of all the shocking predictions you've made the last three years that are unfortunately
[02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:52.731]  Coming true.
[02:09:53.172 --> 02:09:54.354]  Where is the economy?
[02:09:54.934 --> 02:09:56.476]  You say revolution's coming.
[02:09:56.837 --> 02:09:59.300]  The elite are stealing everything, even nailed down.
[02:09:59.861 --> 02:10:05.388]  Gerald Cilente, chief of the Trends Research Institute, tell us what's happening.
[02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:11.542]  Well, we only stick by the facts, as you well know, and we're political atheists.
[02:10:11.583 --> 02:10:16.106]  We don't believe in this two-headed, one-party system.
[02:10:16.486 --> 02:10:21.330]  We don't bow to politicians or genuflect at political altars.
[02:10:21.370 --> 02:10:22.671]  We only look at the facts.
[02:10:23.372 --> 02:10:31.438]  We just heard Vice President Biden last week, a week and a half ago, say that no one, the truth is,
[02:10:32.111 --> 02:10:34.993]  We and everyone else misread the economy.
[02:10:35.053 --> 02:10:35.874]  That's his quote.
[02:10:36.574 --> 02:10:54.846]  Well, the truth is, either he's ignorant, and all of those PhDs and credentialed people in the White House are ignorant, or else they're so arrogant that they can only see outside the beltway, or they can't see outside the beltway and think that they're the only people who know anything, or else they're lying to us.
[02:10:55.267 --> 02:10:56.928]  Those are the only three options.
[02:10:57.288 --> 02:11:01.611]  Because the truth is, as you well know, we saw it, and so did some others.
[02:11:02.491 --> 02:11:06.172]  And so all we're doing is we're looking at the facts, Alex.
[02:11:06.212 --> 02:11:18.955]  And the facts are that the Obama administration said that $787 billion bailout scheme was going to create 600,000 new jobs by this time.
[02:11:19.415 --> 02:11:24.857]  And they said that without the stimulus package, we would see unemployment hit 8%.
[02:11:26.557 --> 02:11:30.279]  In 2009 and peak at 9% in 2010.
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:34.361]  That's what they said.
[02:11:34.962 --> 02:11:39.504]  Now we have unemployment already, official unemployment, at 9.5%.
[02:11:41.085 --> 02:11:42.586]  So they're way off on that.
[02:11:42.886 --> 02:11:44.527]  How could they have any credibility?
[02:11:44.827 --> 02:11:50.210]  We've lost 2.5 million jobs since Obama has become president.
[02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:53.352]  And at very best, if you're going to be generous,
[02:11:53.892 --> 02:12:01.538]  They've spent 20% of the stimulus package and created, at best, 150,000 new jobs.
[02:12:02.059 --> 02:12:16.530]  So when you extrapolate this forward, the best they can do is come up with about 700-750,000 new jobs over two and a half years, whereby they said they were going to create between 3.5 and 4 million jobs
[02:12:19.677 --> 02:12:27.202]  And to wit, we've already lost $7.2 million since this recession, quote, officially began.
[02:12:29.724 --> 02:12:35.448]  Gerald, I was looking at a USA Today Finance Gallup poll.
[02:12:36.923 --> 02:12:42.528]  And it showed how Obama got elected at an 83-84, depending on which one of the graphs.
[02:12:42.548 --> 02:12:44.530]  They've had several of these Gallup polls.
[02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:48.634]  And now he's dropped below 50s, but in some demographics below 50.
[02:12:49.554 --> 02:13:01.165]  That is a faster, steeper, further decline than the previous grand champion loser, the peanut farmer from Georgia.
[02:13:02.902 --> 02:13:05.265]  Back in the 70s, Jimmy Carter.
[02:13:05.685 --> 02:13:10.471]  And so, the bigger the hype, the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[02:13:10.791 --> 02:13:14.135]  People are finding out it was total betrayal, total crap.
[02:13:15.081 --> 02:13:22.968]  George Bush after Jimmy Carter and Obama is the third fastest to fall, but luckily a magic crises popped up.
[02:13:23.969 --> 02:13:37.701]  Nine months in to kind of boost Bush for a while, but minus a stage crises or provocation or war, Obama is a political dead duck and his entire agenda to seize America is failing.
[02:13:38.702 --> 02:13:40.803]  But does he have an ace up his sleeve?
[02:13:40.883 --> 02:13:50.890]  Is it the crisis is going to be so bad we all can only swim to the life raft of the federal government, even if it's a desert island, you know, covered with government zombies?
[02:13:51.571 --> 02:13:52.912]  Or is it a new war?
[02:13:53.412 --> 02:13:55.114]  Is it a staged terror attack?
[02:13:55.474 --> 02:14:02.299]  I mean, if he's in total freefall, the worst in the last hundred years of polling with presidents, what does this mean?
[02:14:03.070 --> 02:14:07.853]  I think you're one of the most astute people out there talking about this in the way that you're talking about it.
[02:14:08.314 --> 02:14:10.976]  Because we saw the exact same things as well.
[02:14:11.516 --> 02:14:29.428]  In that, when you look at the free fall that he's had in the polls, and you compare it as to Carter, and then Bush was one percentage point higher, summer came, Bush was down in the dumps, people were making fun of him for taking a month-long vacation to Crawford, Texas, as the economy was sinking.
[02:14:29.688 --> 02:14:36.811]  Remember, we were just getting, we were just being hit by the dot-com bubble burst, and all of a sudden there was 9-11.
[02:14:37.692 --> 02:14:42.634]  So, these people come up with schemes undreamed of, or things can just happen.
[02:14:43.174 --> 02:14:54.639]  One of the things that we're watching very closely is that the Obama administration is held back in releasing budget projections that were supposed to come out within a week.
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:57.441]  And now they're going to come out with them after, after
[02:14:59.422 --> 02:15:01.583]  Congress takes its recess in August.
[02:15:01.923 --> 02:15:03.424]  That's a big signal to us.
[02:15:04.284 --> 02:15:06.946]  So we're looking at that very, very closely.
[02:15:07.246 --> 02:15:10.487]  Because there may be the shock of our lifetime in those numbers.
[02:15:11.047 --> 02:15:13.869]  No one's talking anymore about the green shoots.
[02:15:14.269 --> 02:15:17.670]  Remember that load of malarkey that they were spreading around?
[02:15:17.690 --> 02:15:21.672]  That money manure that was supposed to be pushing up the economy?
[02:15:22.492 --> 02:15:24.753]  So that's the kind of thing that we're looking for.
[02:15:24.933 --> 02:15:25.974]  Anything could happen.
[02:15:26.354 --> 02:15:28.995]  They come up with schemes undreamed of.
[02:15:29.495 --> 02:15:38.538]  But the reality is, in the final sense, is that, as we've been saying, the world is going to call it the greatest depression.
[02:15:39.339 --> 02:15:42.860]  In America, it's going to be called Obamageddon.
[02:15:43.638 --> 02:15:54.754]  The schemes that they've come up with, these bailouts, buyouts, rescue packages, us owning corrupt companies like Citigroup and General Motors, I love it.
[02:15:55.054 --> 02:15:57.437]  General Motors, they brought back this guy, Lutz.
[02:15:58.499 --> 02:16:01.041]  Who is the Vice Chairman at General Motors?
[02:16:01.401 --> 02:16:14.149]  This is a genius, Alex, that came out in 2005, 2006, that said that anyone that thinks that high gasoline prices are gonna hurt the sales of SUVs doesn't know what they're talking about.
[02:16:14.169 --> 02:16:16.570]  This is a champion they brought back now.
[02:16:16.991 --> 02:16:19.512]  Look what's going on with the Goldman Sachs gang.
[02:16:20.032 --> 02:16:25.496]  I've said this, and I'll say it again, and I've said it before, and I'll repeat it over and over again.
[02:16:26.156 --> 02:16:27.558]  I'm of Italian descent.
[02:16:27.999 --> 02:16:31.182]  I've heard enough Mafia stories for the rest of my life.
[02:16:32.244 --> 02:16:45.059]  If the names on Wall Street were Sellenti, Caruso, Mondavi, Rossini, Puccini, Abatelli, Puccio, they'd call it the Mafia.
[02:16:45.908 --> 02:16:52.432]  Oh, it would be major news every day, how the mafia is ripping off the country.
[02:16:52.452 --> 02:16:55.814]  You know, we just gave these guys, what, how many billions of dollars?
[02:16:56.215 --> 02:16:58.696]  And now they're giving it back to themselves in bonuses.
[02:16:58.996 --> 02:17:00.317]  Oh, it would be big story.
[02:17:00.658 --> 02:17:04.120]  But you can't call the White Shoe Boys criminals.
[02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:14.024]  You could call them, you know, these Ponzi schemes they talk about, with credit swap, fault derivatives, and collateral CBOs and SIVs.
[02:17:14.484 --> 02:17:23.487]  How about calling them, rather than exotic financial instruments, how about calling them Pond Games and Ponzi schemes?
[02:17:23.807 --> 02:17:24.807]  And grand larceny!
[02:17:25.068 --> 02:17:25.948]  Grand larceny!
[02:17:26.613 --> 02:17:28.114]  Well, I mean, Gerald Salente, there you are.
[02:17:28.134 --> 02:17:29.275]  I'm sure you've seen all these clips.
[02:17:29.816 --> 02:17:34.960]  Paulson last week, the congressmen were asking him, where's the $200 million you got personally?
[02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:36.481]  Is that not a conflict of interest?
[02:17:37.242 --> 02:17:40.284]  And how all the regulators were former Goldman Sachs.
[02:17:40.344 --> 02:17:42.806]  And he just said, no, it's no conflict of interest.
[02:17:44.703 --> 02:17:56.307]  We were talking before you came on live about the shockingness of actually watching $23.7 trillion stolen in 10 months, greater than the GDP times 2.
[02:17:57.427 --> 02:17:59.948]  I mean, I feel like I'm in a dream here, Gerald.
[02:18:00.368 --> 02:18:06.250]  Well, you know, we're writing now, we're writing the Autumn Trends Journal, and this is the way we began it.
[02:18:06.952 --> 02:18:10.775]  And we're writing back from the year 2012, we're looking to 2009.
[02:18:12.056 --> 02:18:16.419]  The greatest crime wave ever to hit America was sweeping across the nation.
[02:18:16.999 --> 02:18:31.329]  More lawless than the Wild West, better organized than gangland Chicago, a ruthless mob of financial bandits and political wise guys had taken control of the United States of America.
[02:18:31.929 --> 02:18:37.520]  Not a week went by without Wall Street and Washington committing world-class crimes.
[02:18:38.075 --> 02:18:41.256]  But all carried out under the cover of law.
[02:18:41.797 --> 02:18:49.480]  If perpetrated by individuals, it would have been called robbery, extortion, embezzlement, and fraud.
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:54.382]  And the perpetrators would have been indicted, hauled into court, and brought to justice.
[02:18:54.962 --> 02:19:01.745]  But because politicians and financiers were committing the crimes, it was just called legislation.
[02:19:04.113 --> 02:19:07.436]  Unbelievable, and it seems to be a bottomless pit.
[02:19:07.576 --> 02:19:13.201]  I mean, they're seizing the entire economy, manufacturing, the carbon tax.
[02:19:14.582 --> 02:19:15.303]  Where does it end?
[02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:18.095]  Well, here's the way we're looking at it.
[02:19:18.296 --> 02:19:30.745]  As you know, we keep repeating, and it's worth repeating because it doesn't seem to beat a lot of people in the head the right way, is that you can't print phantom money out of thin air, backed by nothing, producing practically nothing.
[02:19:31.365 --> 02:19:35.408]  We're now looking at the dollar taking another hit against the basket of currencies.
[02:19:35.428 --> 02:19:37.790]  Gold prices are back on the rise.
[02:19:38.250 --> 02:19:40.692]  We heard from China, Russia, India, Brazil.
[02:19:41.233 --> 02:19:42.874]  They all want to bail out of the bucks.
[02:19:44.392 --> 02:19:45.332]  So where is it going?
[02:19:45.812 --> 02:19:47.673]  The decline of Empire America.
[02:19:48.813 --> 02:19:50.973]  Gerald Solente, Trends Research.
[02:19:50.993 --> 02:19:52.534]  We'll give you the website when we get back, listeners.
[02:19:54.674 --> 02:19:57.555]  Will they be able to pump it up one more time, or is this the big one?
[02:19:57.615 --> 02:19:58.815]  Is this the big implosion?
[02:19:59.515 --> 02:19:59.975]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.075 --> 02:20:07.477]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:20:07.837 --> 02:20:09.517]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:20:10.464 --> 02:20:11.505]  But who is the enemy?
[02:20:12.025 --> 02:20:12.526]  Bin Laden.
[02:20:12.826 --> 02:20:13.827]  This is his M.O.s.
[02:20:13.847 --> 02:20:15.168]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:20:15.188 --> 02:20:16.830]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:23.936]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:20:24.336 --> 02:20:24.777]  Some U.S.
[02:20:24.817 --> 02:20:30.442]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:20:31.142 --> 02:20:34.624]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:20:34.644 --> 02:20:37.646]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:21:00.914 --> 02:21:07.116]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:07.576 --> 02:21:15.358]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:15.698 --> 02:21:23.540]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:28.625]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:28.965 --> 02:21:33.649]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:38.033]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:38.534 --> 02:21:39.555]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:39.615 --> 02:21:43.659]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:22:00.436 --> 02:22:01.738]  Are you constantly tired?
[02:22:01.998 --> 02:22:03.579]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:06.903]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[02:22:07.143 --> 02:22:09.906]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[02:22:21.457 --> 02:22:29.702]  Studies show that liquid zeolite captures triggering antigens which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[02:22:30.043 --> 02:22:38.188]  Liquid zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that, when taken daily, supports a healthy, happy, and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.

[02:23:00.114 --> 02:23:01.135]  Hi, Ed Schultz here.

[02:23:58.049 --> 02:23:59.370]  It cleans anything.
[02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:22.159]  Carol Celente going right back to your calls coming up the next segment.
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:43.421]  When you say this is the greatest heist in history, I don't think people understand.
[02:24:43.461 --> 02:24:46.562]  You really mean that.
[02:24:47.543 --> 02:24:54.305]  $23.7 trillion and they're grabbing every sector of the economy and the green tax, the carbon tax allows the bureaucracy.
[02:24:54.365 --> 02:24:56.926]  I have the bill that they passed in secret, now public.
[02:24:57.266 --> 02:24:59.027]  As you know, I want your take on that.
[02:24:59.407 --> 02:25:03.889]  Allows federal agencies to raise taxes on toilet paper, beef,
[02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:08.097]  Well, the merger of state and corporate powers according to Mussolini
[02:25:16.482 --> 02:25:17.482]  It's called fascism.
[02:25:17.502 --> 02:25:23.465]  So if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, let's call it a spade a spade.
[02:25:23.545 --> 02:25:24.546]  It's fascism.
[02:25:24.566 --> 02:25:33.870]  And to pick up on the second part of what you were saying, and I was saying, was at first they went through this whole scheme of the money printing.
[02:25:33.890 --> 02:25:43.654]  Well that's going to run out, as we're seeing now, with the diving of the dollar and other currencies looking for, other countries looking for new reserve currency.
[02:25:44.034 --> 02:25:45.695]  So the next scheme is,
[02:25:46.395 --> 02:25:46.915]  I don't
[02:26:06.647 --> 02:26:13.051]  If you help the country blind, you can get an award for it, or they'll make you a Treasury Secretary.
[02:26:13.431 --> 02:26:20.735]  So the scheme, Alex, is after the printing game runs out, it's the tax to death game.
[02:26:22.637 --> 02:26:26.200]  This whole notion of too big to fail.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:27.841]  Who came up with that one?
[02:26:28.241 --> 02:26:32.124]  I can say with full authority that their mother's not better than mine.
[02:26:32.684 --> 02:26:34.925]  What would happen if they failed?
[02:26:35.286 --> 02:26:36.907]  No one's ever told us.
[02:26:37.487 --> 02:26:46.934]  But yet we hear from Henry the Don Paulson at the last House Oversight meeting saying, quote, our response
[02:26:47.834 --> 02:26:57.701]  Our responses were not perfect, but I am confident that they were substantially correct and that they saved this country from great peril.
[02:27:17.694 --> 02:27:20.196]  And they're more than that, as I said.
[02:27:20.216 --> 02:27:21.356]  They're the Wall Street Mafia.
[02:27:34.745 --> 02:27:37.187]  It's Henry the Don Paulson.
[02:27:37.548 --> 02:27:40.610]  You read the New York Times, he bullied Congress.
[02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:42.071]  Bullied Congress?
[02:27:42.352 --> 02:27:43.252]  What do you mean bully?
[02:27:43.312 --> 02:27:45.855]  Who is this guy to bully Congress?
[02:27:46.255 --> 02:27:51.019]  Oh, and there's Jamie Legs Diamond from JP Morgan.
[02:27:51.479 --> 02:27:58.866]  And there's, uh, who's that guy from Citigroup that put this whole grand scheme together.
[02:27:59.611 --> 02:28:04.314]  Sandy, Greedy Pig, Wilde, now let's call them who they are.
[02:28:04.334 --> 02:28:07.055]  They're robbing this nation blind.
[02:28:07.496 --> 02:28:19.563]  And the people are either drug dealers, became, we've gone, we have gone from the home of the brave to what's happened to this country.
[02:28:20.043 --> 02:28:27.648]  That we have become so subservient and so federally dictated.
[02:28:28.647 --> 02:28:31.430]  We're free and we're not brave as a nation.
[02:28:31.450 --> 02:28:36.834]  You know, people can make fun of the French all they want, but boy, the French got it down.
[02:28:36.854 --> 02:28:43.060]  Look what happened when that company was trying to shaft the employees out of their severance pay.
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:47.224]  You know, they threatened to blow the place up and all the equipment in it.
[02:28:47.244 --> 02:28:51.748]  When they do boss snappings, these are the people that brought us off with their heads.
[02:28:52.268 --> 02:29:01.590]  They know what it's like to be living under the tyrannical government, where they say, let them eat bread, now it's give them some health care.
[02:29:02.250 --> 02:29:10.832]  Well, on top of this, when you look at the French, when they try to plant GMO crops there, the farmers just burn it down.
[02:29:11.672 --> 02:29:15.913]  And I don't know how Americans were always known as the quickest to stand up to tyranny.
[02:29:16.473 --> 02:29:19.234]  Now we're known worldwide as kind of the suckers.
[02:29:19.654 --> 02:29:20.594]  How did that happen?
[02:29:21.027 --> 02:29:30.211]  Well, I have to say, you know, you are what you eat, and look what this country leads, and look what they look like, and look what they've become.
[02:29:30.231 --> 02:29:33.692]  Yeah, we just became decadent.
[02:29:33.772 --> 02:29:39.134]  We're the great-grandchildren of really hard-working people, and we've become a bunch of slobs, myself included.
[02:29:39.154 --> 02:29:42.676]  We gotta get our dignity back and not be so cowed.
[02:29:42.716 --> 02:29:48.098]  Gerald, I want to take calls and get into where you see all this going, how you see the revolution breaking out, and a lot more.
[02:29:48.118 --> 02:29:50.599]  The website is TrendsResearch.com.
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:54.323]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.243 --> 02:29:58.046]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.688 --> 02:30:05.872]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:30:06.012 --> 02:30:10.376]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:30:10.536 --> 02:30:12.397]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:30:12.818 --> 02:30:14.179]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:30:14.439 --> 02:30:15.480]  There is a solution.
[02:30:15.700 --> 02:30:23.707]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:05.955]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:31:06.155 --> 02:31:09.959]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:10.179 --> 02:31:15.785]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:16.085 --> 02:31:20.950]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.150 --> 02:31:21.611]  Number three,
[02:31:22.051 --> 02:31:27.495]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:31:28.356 --> 02:31:30.998]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:31:31.258 --> 02:31:34.681]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.782 --> 02:31:39.385]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:31:39.625 --> 02:31:45.109]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[02:33:15.339 --> 02:33:19.502]  Gerald Salente is our guest, and in his three short minutes, we're going right back to him.
[02:33:19.602 --> 02:33:37.953]  But, during the break, the last break, before last, about ten minutes ago, I called Ted up, the owner of Genesis and Miner's Resources, and I said, do you have any of that gold and silver left from when gold was 900 bucks an ounce?
[02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:46.544]  And when silver was a dollar less, and he said, yes, we're almost out of it, but we have the very tail end, so this is the last.
[02:33:47.024 --> 02:34:00.072]  Gold up over 40 plus dollars from that point, silver way up, and this is the very end of the Lakotas, the Franks, the Sovereigns, and some other coins Ted Anderson has right now until midnight tonight.
[02:34:00.972 --> 02:34:02.733]  Ted, that's as long as you can hold it, correct?
[02:34:04.514 --> 02:34:06.535]  The price on the internet has already gone up.
[02:34:06.575 --> 02:34:14.198]  If you go to our web offers, you'll find that the Lakotas are in the $19 range, where these are still sitting at that $18.17.
[02:34:14.418 --> 02:34:17.839]  So yeah, that is a really good buy.
[02:34:18.479 --> 02:34:27.203]  The reason why I was able to put them up there is I had about 900 of them left in my inventory, although some of those are spoken for already, but I haven't received the checks from people.
[02:34:27.683 --> 02:34:31.386]  But I will hold it at that price, but then come tomorrow, it's like $19.17.
[02:34:31.546 --> 02:34:35.649]  I can't remember exactly what the number was.
[02:34:35.669 --> 02:34:38.090]  Okay, so the Lakotas are going up.
[02:34:38.150 --> 02:34:41.853]  What about gold at the lower price when you bought it at $909.05?
[02:34:42.713 --> 02:34:46.836]  Well, that is obviously just a steal if I ever heard of one.
[02:34:46.896 --> 02:34:50.179]  I mean, you have still right now the Franks sitting at $216 a coin.
[02:34:50.199 --> 02:34:51.219]  The British Sovereign is at $266.
[02:34:55.382 --> 02:34:57.183]  Both of those coins have gone up in price.
[02:34:57.623 --> 02:35:07.048]  I don't put them on our internet site, but they all are up in price because of the fact that gold was trading at $9.13 when I locked them in at this level.
[02:35:07.148 --> 02:35:11.490]  Currently right now, today's spot price of gold, the last time I've looked, was $9.5160.
[02:35:11.630 --> 02:35:13.191]  It's been as high as $9.590 already today.
[02:35:16.773 --> 02:35:31.170]  So, yeah, there's definitely... Yeah, and to simplify this, folks, for people to understand, you bought this gold and silver when the market two or three weeks ago was, in gold, almost $50 lower than it is now, and in silver over a dollar lower than it is now.
[02:35:31.610 --> 02:35:34.113]  So you're selling out of these stores you have.
[02:35:34.153 --> 02:35:34.974]  You're almost out.
[02:35:35.294 --> 02:35:39.575]  Instead of raising your prices when gold and silver goes up, that's how you should make a profit.
[02:35:39.595 --> 02:35:41.856]  You know, we're capitalists, we're not communists.
[02:35:42.116 --> 02:35:46.297]  You're passing those savings on, but this is the end.
[02:35:46.357 --> 02:35:48.138]  This is the last time, Ted, correct?
[02:35:48.258 --> 02:35:49.118]  It is the end of this.
[02:35:49.198 --> 02:35:56.500]  I can tell you right now, Alex, I placed an order today for 5,000 more Lakotas, and the price is much higher than what I'm offering right now.
[02:35:56.540 --> 02:35:57.781]  So I can't do that.
[02:35:58.121 --> 02:35:59.481]  And is this the end for the gold?
[02:35:59.501 --> 02:36:00.962]  Is this the end for the gold?
[02:36:01.022 --> 02:36:03.943]  The gold is still, they're both the same thing.
[02:36:03.963 --> 02:36:04.723]  I mean, the gold is
[02:36:05.912 --> 02:36:07.733]  I'm lucky to be able to carry it through midnight.
[02:36:07.873 --> 02:36:10.793]  I will, just because I'll lose some money on some of the deals.
[02:36:11.333 --> 02:36:13.274]  Okay, so you're almost completely out.
[02:36:13.294 --> 02:36:15.354]  1-800-686-2237 800-686-2237 800-686-2237 The brokers will be there until midnight tonight.
[02:36:15.394 --> 02:36:15.835]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:36:15.875 --> 02:36:16.215]  Call today.
[02:36:16.235 --> 02:36:16.295]  1-800-686-2237
[02:36:29.878 --> 02:36:30.278]  Absolutely.
[02:36:30.298 --> 02:36:32.159]  Just leave a message on the voice recorder.
[02:36:32.259 --> 02:36:33.680]  We're going to honor everybody.
[02:36:47.345 --> 02:36:50.326]  All right, 800-686-2237.
[02:36:50.346 --> 02:36:52.207]  You can't get this deal at MyHistoryHorses.com.
[02:36:52.427 --> 02:36:55.568]  You've got to call and say it's the Alex Jones, Ted Anderson, radio special, 800-686-2237.
[02:36:55.688 --> 02:37:00.630]  Ted, thank you so much.
[02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:02.050]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:37:02.371 --> 02:37:02.691]  You bet.
[02:37:03.031 --> 02:37:05.752]  Going back to Gerald Cilento, I appreciate holding the website again.
[02:37:07.113 --> 02:37:14.556]  We'll put up on screen for you right now for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:37:14.877 --> 02:37:17.118]  Gerald, I'm just going to throw this at you in the cold.
[02:37:17.138 --> 02:37:19.359]  I don't even know what your view is on this particularly.
[02:37:19.679 --> 02:37:24.522]  What do you think of people getting out of paper and moving partially into silver or gold?
[02:37:24.662 --> 02:37:26.583]  Is that generally a smart idea?
[02:37:27.463 --> 02:37:33.908]  Well, we don't give investment advice, but I can tell you that I'm 80% invested in gold, and I keep buying it.
[02:37:34.849 --> 02:37:42.975]  And my strategy, by the way, is that I also hedge my currencies in the sense that I'll own dollars, but I'll also own euros.
[02:37:43.096 --> 02:37:44.637]  One goes up, the other goes down.
[02:37:45.677 --> 02:37:49.038]  I just want parity to keep what I have.
[02:37:49.338 --> 02:37:51.139]  This is wealth preservation.
[02:37:51.679 --> 02:37:53.920]  And to us, gold is the wild card.
[02:37:54.340 --> 02:38:04.503]  But having said that, as you may or may not know, in our December 2001, we had said that gold prices had bottomed.
[02:38:05.244 --> 02:38:11.266]  And we've been bullish on gold since, and we're predicting in our forecast of gold 2000.
[02:38:13.248 --> 02:38:13.548]  Really?
[02:38:13.608 --> 02:38:15.470]  Do you have an idea when?
[02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:20.915]  No, it's hard to tell, because as you well know, these markets are being highly manipulated.
[02:38:21.556 --> 02:38:26.400]  And around the world, people are bailing out of bucks, as we spoke about earlier.
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:29.142]  And they're looking for new reserve currency.
[02:38:29.182 --> 02:38:37.470]  I mentioned earlier that the Obama administration is holding out, coming out with their budget projections, waiting until the dead heat of summer.
[02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:41.814]  When everyone's in a vacation state of mind and Congress isn't there.
[02:38:42.254 --> 02:38:47.439]  So there can be some very earth-shaking developments that are going to rattle the dollar.
[02:38:47.979 --> 02:39:01.672]  So it could happen at any time, but always remember that the game is going to be manipulated because once the world wakes up to the idea that their fiat currencies aren't going to be worth
[02:39:02.032 --> 02:39:05.995]  The paper they're printed on is going to be a huge run to gold.
[02:39:06.435 --> 02:39:18.742]  Another very important aspect, there's only one member of the G20 out there that's really criticizing America for its stimulus recovery bailout and buyout package.
[02:39:18.762 --> 02:39:19.082]  Terminate it.
[02:39:19.803 --> 02:39:20.383]  And why?
[02:39:21.624 --> 02:39:23.685]  Because of gold issues.
[02:39:24.326 --> 02:39:26.007]  And they know what it's like.
[02:39:26.863 --> 02:39:36.712]  These are the people, the Weimar Republic, they still have the people alive that told the stories of going to a supermarket with a wheelbarrow of money.
[02:39:37.653 --> 02:39:46.041]  And they know how it happened because they printed phantom money out of thin air based on nothing and producing practically nothing.
[02:39:46.822 --> 02:39:49.044]  So that's why we're bullish on gold.
[02:39:50.270 --> 02:40:00.875]  But the bankers to kill hyperinflation aren't just loaning the money, so instead you have everything imploding while they print fiat to buy up real infrastructure.
[02:40:01.275 --> 02:40:19.584]  And then, from the experts we've talked to, I want to see if you agree with the general economist we've had on, that then later the hyperinflation comes as an added nightmare over a depression economy, the untold superstorm or perfect storm of hyper-stag inflation.
[02:40:19.924 --> 02:40:20.945]  Yeah, that's very true.
[02:40:21.025 --> 02:40:22.005]  And depression, actually.
[02:40:22.025 --> 02:40:23.986]  It's hyperinflation and depression.
[02:40:24.306 --> 02:40:25.187]  Look at the numbers.
[02:40:25.507 --> 02:40:31.209]  You well know, depending on who you talk to, the effective unemployment rate is 18.7 percent.
[02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:35.231]  Others say the unofficial rate is 20 percent.
[02:40:35.711 --> 02:40:37.272]  So that's what we're really looking at.
[02:40:37.352 --> 02:40:38.713]  People going... These kids...
[02:40:41.161 --> 02:40:42.802]  That's what I was about to say.
[02:40:42.822 --> 02:40:45.725]  You were saying the next big bubble is the college bubble.
[02:40:46.085 --> 02:40:53.891]  They're going into debt now for jobs that aren't even going to exist, and the commercial real estate, as you said on the show a year and a half ago, is starting to implode.
[02:40:54.111 --> 02:40:55.512]  They're saying that's the next big one.
[02:40:55.813 --> 02:40:56.974]  Give us some of those trends.
[02:40:58.054 --> 02:41:03.659]  But going back to gold, because we've interviewed so many experts who are bullish or bearish on gold, but all of them acknowledge
[02:41:04.614 --> 02:41:17.882]  That everybody should be partially in gold and silver as a hedge against inflation, as an emergency parachute to just protect wealth, to make sure you've got something that can't be dissipated overnight like paper.
[02:41:17.982 --> 02:41:32.571]  But, that speculatively, it's also the biggest boon in speculative, because if the dollar does implode or other major currencies, they're all overprinting right now as you know, that's kind of their answer is global inflation, kind of at parity, that gold could go to $3,000, $4,000.
[02:41:34.207 --> 02:41:34.847]  Well, it can.
[02:41:34.867 --> 02:41:36.388]  It really can.
[02:41:38.570 --> 02:41:42.352]  And then if there's war on top of this, because who knows?
[02:41:42.372 --> 02:41:59.843]  They keep talking about bombing Iran, Israel does, or invading them at some level, and we've said from the onset that if the United States or Israel attack Iran, it's the beginning of World War III, because then you're going to start
[02:42:00.083 --> 02:42:00.763]  We're good to go.
[02:42:23.419 --> 02:42:24.780]  It goes back to 4.5%.
[02:42:26.222 --> 02:42:31.847]  We wipe out our trade deficits, our budget deficits, and that's highly unlikely.
[02:42:31.947 --> 02:42:33.189]  And you're physically holding it.
[02:42:33.249 --> 02:42:38.414]  You can jump out of it if it starts going down, or you can wait until it goes back up the next time.
[02:42:38.514 --> 02:42:39.415]  I have to tell you something.
[02:42:39.435 --> 02:42:40.516]  This is very important.
[02:42:40.596 --> 02:42:42.978]  I've been buying gold for a long time.
[02:42:43.979 --> 02:42:45.500]  In life, you have ups and downs.
[02:42:47.422 --> 02:42:50.787]  Fake about this, and I've had lean years in my life.
[02:42:51.348 --> 02:42:53.291]  What saved me was having gold.
[02:42:55.319 --> 02:43:02.763]  Because as you well know, getting rid of gold, cashing in gold isn't as easy as writing a check.
[02:43:03.283 --> 02:43:08.726]  So you really have to think twice and three times and four times before you unload that gold.
[02:43:09.526 --> 02:43:20.232]  And so you hold on to that store base of wealth without writing a check off to go spend it or to pay a debt.
[02:43:20.652 --> 02:43:30.222]  And what I also did with my gold is I used it as collateral to borrow, knowing that I wanted that gold back.
[02:43:30.523 --> 02:43:36.869]  And I never had any problem loaning money, borrowing money privately, having that as a backdrop.
[02:43:37.130 --> 02:43:39.012]  So I'm a firm believer in gold.
[02:43:40.245 --> 02:43:41.486]  It's good as gold is the saying.
[02:43:41.526 --> 02:43:46.030]  I just wanted to bring that up because everything else is performing like hell right now.
[02:43:46.470 --> 02:43:48.031]  Treasuries almost have no yield.
[02:43:48.111 --> 02:43:49.192]  Everybody's running to them.
[02:43:50.193 --> 02:43:52.395]  And it's just an amazing scam we're witnessing.
[02:43:52.415 --> 02:43:56.798]  I want to go to calls for Gerald Celente here in just a moment in the time we have left.
[02:43:56.838 --> 02:44:01.282]  But, Gerald, how do you see... Well, two questions before I forget.
[02:44:01.362 --> 02:44:02.903]  First, the flu hype.
[02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:05.631]  Killed maybe 200 people worldwide.
[02:44:05.651 --> 02:44:07.692]  They're talking about global force inoculations.
[02:44:08.193 --> 02:44:14.436]  Is this the Global World Trade Organization, World Health Organization, cover to bring in control?
[02:44:15.096 --> 02:44:20.519]  Why are they saying, oh, it's all over in the fall, they're the ones fear-mongering in government?
[02:44:21.019 --> 02:44:24.221]  A. And then B, is that kind of a backdrop?
[02:44:24.541 --> 02:44:32.746]  If they need to suppress revolution, they'll just hype up fear about flu and then people will stand down because that was said of Mexico.
[02:44:33.598 --> 02:44:35.441]  What they're doing and why, we don't know.
[02:44:35.742 --> 02:44:38.888]  We're not on the inside, but I will tell you what we're forecasting.
[02:44:39.529 --> 02:44:42.755]  And we're forecasting that there's going to be something.
[02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:47.031]  And it's going to, we're calling it the new black plague, and it's going to be real.
[02:44:47.691 --> 02:44:52.892]  You can't put poison in your food, in the air, in the water.
[02:44:53.332 --> 02:44:59.394]  You can't dump, you just can't keep poisoning the host without causing a host of problems.
[02:44:59.434 --> 02:45:02.855]  So there's going to be something that breaks down the immune systems.
[02:45:02.875 --> 02:45:03.915]  Is this really it?
[02:45:04.455 --> 02:45:05.455]  Probably not.
[02:45:05.575 --> 02:45:08.676]  Are the drug companies going to benefit from anything that happens?
[02:45:09.298 --> 02:45:10.179]  Absolutely.
[02:45:10.579 --> 02:45:28.048]  Will they use something like this as the false flag to declare martial law and to take the people that were once the home of the free and the brave into federal dictate and to subservience?
[02:45:28.628 --> 02:45:33.995]  Yes, they could very well use something like that as a scare tactic.
[02:45:34.075 --> 02:45:41.163]  And look, I mean, Bush used the most effective one that I've seen in my lifetime with the war on terror.
[02:45:43.366 --> 02:45:46.469]  Absolutely, and then they've got the continuing imploding economy.
[02:45:47.475 --> 02:46:01.063]  I mean, people have to go to the government for help through that, and then now they're announcing he's breaking all his promises, he's going to raise health care taxes on everybody, and surtaxes and green taxes on everybody's electricity.
[02:46:02.273 --> 02:46:08.416]  Would you say Obama wins or is a contender for the crown of the biggest liar?
[02:46:08.476 --> 02:46:09.776]  Because I thought Clinton was a liar.
[02:46:09.796 --> 02:46:10.717]  I thought Bush was a liar.
[02:46:10.957 --> 02:46:29.885]  Well, the thing that we put Obama in is the mass destruction of what was once the entrepreneurial empire into what Mussolini said, the merger of state and corporate powers into fascism, where government and major corporations are running the whole show again.
[02:46:30.485 --> 02:46:34.266]  You know, look at the people, look at the banks, look at the control.
[02:46:34.286 --> 02:46:36.347]  And so that's what we see.
[02:46:36.667 --> 02:46:39.808]  And by the way, people ask us, what are some of the solutions?
[02:46:40.368 --> 02:46:41.829]  Well, here's one solution.
[02:46:42.449 --> 02:46:44.370]  We don't need Wall Street.
[02:46:45.130 --> 02:46:46.391]  We need Main Street.
[02:46:46.971 --> 02:46:48.931]  We don't need Walmarts.
[02:46:49.492 --> 02:46:50.892]  We need Mom and Pops.
[02:46:51.412 --> 02:46:53.673]  We don't need agribusiness.
[02:46:54.413 --> 02:46:56.474]  We need family farms.
[02:46:57.014 --> 02:46:59.015]  We don't need Monsanto.
[02:46:59.699 --> 02:47:00.900]  We need organic.
[02:47:01.300 --> 02:47:04.282]  And this is not hyperbole, it's a fact.
[02:47:04.702 --> 02:47:13.988]  A fact based on the knowledge that we were, the United States of America, the most egalitarian nation on Earth.
[02:47:14.588 --> 02:47:18.791]  Respected and envied by everyone else on Earth.
[02:47:19.471 --> 02:47:23.414]  From the most egalitarian, when that model existed,
[02:47:24.114 --> 02:47:48.395]  Main Street, Mom and Pop, Family Farm, and Organic, we have now become the nation where the gap between the rich and the poor is the widest of any of the industrialized nations, and where we used to be number one in health care, in education, in longevity, in quality of life, when we lived by Main Street, Mom and Pop,
[02:47:48.783 --> 02:47:55.727]  Because we're mentally and spiritually poisoned and the establishment knew that and all those big
[02:48:04.907 --> 02:48:10.308]  Vertically integrated corporate structures are waging war against mom and pop and Main Street.
[02:48:10.628 --> 02:48:18.310]  And now they've got the animal ID, the premises ID, openly to shut down family farms and ranches, the Clean Water Restoration Act to federalize all the water.
[02:48:18.931 --> 02:48:25.152]  I mean, they're coming in as the economy implodes trying to pass the carbon tax, knowing it'll shut things down further.
[02:48:25.612 --> 02:48:28.273]  This is like the global mafia burning us out.
[02:48:29.156 --> 02:48:29.416]  What?
[02:48:29.716 --> 02:48:31.757]  So you're saying the revolution isn't just physical?
[02:48:32.117 --> 02:48:42.942]  It's going to be people not going to Walmart anymore, people planting their own gardens, people not doing what the local thugs and feds say, and people just getting back to basics?
[02:48:43.302 --> 02:48:44.683]  Or what else is in the revolution?
[02:48:47.250 --> 02:48:48.991]  I boycott corporate food.
[02:48:49.312 --> 02:48:49.952]  I won't eat it.
[02:48:50.012 --> 02:48:50.252]  I won't.
[02:48:50.733 --> 02:48:51.834]  I go to the local guy.
[02:48:51.854 --> 02:48:53.655]  I won't go to the Dunkin Donuts guy.
[02:48:53.675 --> 02:48:56.017]  You know, I support.
[02:48:56.057 --> 02:48:57.619]  I go to the farmer's markets.
[02:48:58.079 --> 02:49:00.601]  I don't buy factory food.
[02:49:00.621 --> 02:49:03.804]  You know, Alex, we just saw Obama.
[02:49:03.824 --> 02:49:10.469]  They made a whole big deal about planting their organic garden and buying local food and how healthy
[02:49:10.609 --> 02:49:11.851]  We're good to go.
[02:49:22.452 --> 02:49:27.136]  The rest of you people out there, fatten yourself up on the junk food.
[02:49:27.576 --> 02:49:29.357]  What goes in goes out.
[02:49:29.858 --> 02:49:32.700]  Junk food, junk minds, junk thinking.
[02:49:33.220 --> 02:49:37.904]  And for this country to get back to where it used to be, we need a renaissance.
[02:49:38.024 --> 02:49:40.346]  And the renaissance is a rebirth.
[02:49:40.486 --> 02:49:42.887]  A rebirth to when America was great.
[02:49:43.308 --> 02:49:44.889]  When Main Street ruled.
[02:49:47.568 --> 02:49:48.489]  We're good to go.
[02:50:08.922 --> 02:50:13.403]  And then they took the money and then loaned it to us in interest, and it's just total bastards.
[02:50:13.423 --> 02:50:17.024]  We're going to come back in the final segment and talk to Maria, Linda, and Randall.
[02:50:17.164 --> 02:50:24.366]  Quick comments, quick questions from those three callers, quick answers from Gerald Cilente, and I can't wait to have him back up again soon.
[02:50:25.266 --> 02:50:27.127]  But, Wendy, we've got 30 seconds before break.
[02:50:27.147 --> 02:50:30.908]  Gerald, when do you see physical confrontation, rioting beginning?
[02:50:31.937 --> 02:50:41.020]  You know, we may see riots this summer as the heat of the city streets becomes uncontrollable, as people can't find jobs and have no future.
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:46.462]  And then they're talking about, by next year, 25% unemployment?
[02:50:47.202 --> 02:50:57.265]  And when you look upon the minority groups, the people that have no education, and they're drugged out, you have a recipe for violence and disaster.
[02:50:57.865 --> 02:50:59.306]  Stay there, Gerald Cilente.
[02:50:59.446 --> 02:51:00.266]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:07.498 --> 02:51:18.545]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[02:51:19.246 --> 02:51:21.767]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[02:51:22.348 --> 02:51:30.013]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[02:51:32.034 --> 02:51:36.157]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[02:51:36.758 --> 02:51:39.920]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[02:51:40.640 --> 02:51:43.982]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[02:51:44.522 --> 02:51:49.164]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[02:51:49.685 --> 02:51:52.966]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[02:52:01.024 --> 02:52:02.725]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:52:03.025 --> 02:52:06.446]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:52:06.646 --> 02:52:08.907]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:52:09.127 --> 02:52:11.868]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:52:12.168 --> 02:52:17.690]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:52:17.950 --> 02:52:21.231]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to
[02:52:21.291 --> 02:52:21.731]  We're good to go.
[02:52:48.629 --> 02:52:51.174]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:52:51.534 --> 02:52:53.197]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:52:53.598 --> 02:52:55.362]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:52:55.602 --> 02:52:57.425]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:52:57.746 --> 02:52:59.189]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:52:59.549 --> 02:53:00.311]  PrisonPlanet.TV
[02:53:02.069 --> 02:53:07.533]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:53:07.573 --> 02:53:08.093]  and the world.
[02:53:08.374 --> 02:53:11.816]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:53:12.216 --> 02:53:18.461]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:53:18.721 --> 02:53:20.522]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:53:20.762 --> 02:53:28.708]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:53:28.968 --> 02:53:33.389]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:39.211]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:53:39.492 --> 02:53:41.492]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:53:41.672 --> 02:53:43.913]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[02:53:44.193 --> 02:53:44.534]  I think so.
[02:54:03.275 --> 02:54:07.698]  Gerald Salente, I want to jam in a few final calls here for you, but quickly, I have this question.
[02:54:07.758 --> 02:54:17.587]  Can all the king's horses, all the king's men, all the police state grid they've set up, planning this bankruptcy all along, to bring in their new world order, is it going to be successful?
[02:54:17.667 --> 02:54:21.650]  Because even with all the Obama hype, it's not working.
[02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:24.973]  I mean, this looks like it's going to turn into a really bloody confrontation.
[02:54:25.731 --> 02:54:27.594]  Well, it's gonna be ugly.
[02:54:27.654 --> 02:54:31.119]  I mean, now they're changing their tune from Green Shoots.
[02:54:31.599 --> 02:54:33.762]  Now they're saying a double-dip recession.
[02:54:33.782 --> 02:54:35.525]  It's not a double-dip recession.
[02:54:35.585 --> 02:54:36.386]  It never ended.
[02:54:36.626 --> 02:54:37.808]  Jobless recovery?
[02:54:38.309 --> 02:54:39.230]  Jobless recovery?
[02:54:39.530 --> 02:54:41.293]  It's like almost pregnant, isn't it?
[02:54:43.007 --> 02:54:45.949]  No, so no, they're not going to be able to stop it.
[02:54:46.009 --> 02:54:58.617]  The only way they will be able to stop it is to continue to do what they're doing and that is to keep the people under federal dictate and to make them more subservient and the pressure that is going
[02:54:58.717 --> 02:55:08.480]  It's going to be bearing upon the people at every level, from parking meters to property taxes, from federal taxes to sin taxes.
[02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:10.461]  It's going to be taxes.
[02:55:10.761 --> 02:55:16.123]  They're going to squeeze the little people until there are riots and rebellions.
[02:55:16.523 --> 02:55:22.845]  And by the way, the tea parties and tax protests, that's just the beginning.
[02:55:23.005 --> 02:55:26.526]  It was history that has been made, and they're trying to play it down.
[02:55:27.236 --> 02:55:30.159]  Maria in California, you're on the air with Gerald Solente.
[02:55:30.179 --> 02:55:32.581]  Hi Jones, I'm Solente.
[02:55:32.621 --> 02:55:34.202]  It's an honor to speak with both of you.
[02:55:34.622 --> 02:55:48.534]  I actually wanted to call in because I'm calling from Pomona, California and in the past two months the police activity here has gone from hearing them once maybe every other month to hearing them three times a day.
[02:55:48.694 --> 02:55:51.377]  I'm hearing the ambulance go off and the police everywhere.
[02:55:52.058 --> 02:56:01.378]  And I just want to know, if I'm living in a suburban area like this, I mean, how bad is it going to get while our city council... Yeah, that's something they're covering up, Gerald, obviously.
[02:56:01.458 --> 02:56:02.580]  Crimes exploding.
[02:56:03.734 --> 02:56:05.496]  Uh, they're trying to squeeze the public.
[02:56:05.596 --> 02:56:06.357]  It's not working.
[02:56:06.417 --> 02:56:09.980]  You said a year ago on this show, California was going to collapse.
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:11.241]  That's now beginning.
[02:56:11.281 --> 02:56:11.641]  Gerald?
[02:56:12.041 --> 02:56:13.002]  Yes, it is beginning.
[02:56:13.022 --> 02:56:14.724]  There's going to be other states to follow.
[02:56:14.784 --> 02:56:17.306]  I mean, Michigan, around Detroit, it's a war zone.
[02:56:17.866 --> 02:56:24.792]  And you know, my saying as a Bronx boy is, when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:56:25.133 --> 02:56:26.814]  We're going to see more of these home invasions.
[02:56:27.855 --> 02:56:31.118]  It's going to turn ugly over the years.
[02:56:31.658 --> 02:56:40.846]  So I'm a believer in Second Amendment rights, as are you, Alex, and that people need to learn self-protection because nobody's going to protect you.
[02:56:40.866 --> 02:56:52.356]  And as you also know, I'm a close combat practitioner, and John Perkins from attackproof.com has been my teacher for many, many years.
[02:56:52.956 --> 02:56:58.179]  So, people have to understand there will be no savior other than yourself.
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:56:59.440]  Absolutely.
[02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:00.981]  Maria, does that answer your question?
[02:57:01.602 --> 02:57:02.102]  Yes, it does.
[02:57:02.202 --> 02:57:02.962]  One more question.
[02:57:03.143 --> 02:57:07.585]  I've prepared, I've stockpiled, I have my gun and everything.
[02:57:08.006 --> 02:57:09.987]  What can I do with the rest of my fiat money?
[02:57:11.075 --> 02:57:13.397]  Well, again, we don't give financial advice.
[02:57:13.457 --> 02:57:15.259]  I can only tell you what I do with mine.
[02:57:15.679 --> 02:57:17.981]  And I'm very heavily invested in gold.
[02:57:18.522 --> 02:57:22.485]  And I also, what I do is because I run a business, I need cash.
[02:57:23.066 --> 02:57:28.651]  I put my money between different currencies so that if the dollar goes down, the other one goes up.
[02:57:28.891 --> 02:57:30.032]  Maria, you answered that earlier.
[02:57:30.212 --> 02:57:30.953]  We've got to jump.
[02:57:31.013 --> 02:57:32.914]  Final call, Linda in Rhode Island.
[02:57:32.955 --> 02:57:34.376]  Quickly, you're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[02:57:34.966 --> 02:57:36.208]  Hi Alex and Gerald.
[02:57:36.668 --> 02:57:38.010]  I have a question for Gerald.
[02:57:38.070 --> 02:57:47.242]  Last week, Bob Chapman was on and he stated that they would close the banks for a week and that they were going to open them up again and everything would be alright.
[02:57:47.402 --> 02:57:49.285]  I think he was too light-hearted on that.
[02:57:49.305 --> 02:57:50.687]  Can you say something about that?
[02:57:51.357 --> 02:57:56.661]  Well, if they close the banks, we believe that they'll devalue the dollar when they reopen them.
[02:57:57.061 --> 02:57:59.183]  You won't be able to get all your money back out.
[02:57:59.223 --> 02:58:01.064]  They'll use the Argentinian method.
[02:58:01.405 --> 02:58:07.809]  That's what they did over there when their dollar collapsed, and that's what we believe they'll do over here.
[02:58:07.829 --> 02:58:11.612]  Does that answer your question, Linda?
[02:58:11.912 --> 02:58:15.015]  You'll be able to get your money, but you won't be able to get it out all at once.
[02:58:15.035 --> 02:58:15.815]  Right.
[02:58:16.276 --> 02:58:19.018]  And it won't be worth what it was if they close the banks.
[02:58:20.649 --> 02:58:24.230]  Yeah, because who's going to want to go to work thinking, oh, maybe they'll get paid in a month.
[02:58:24.890 --> 02:58:26.030]  Yeah, Linda, thank you.
[02:58:27.610 --> 02:58:30.371]  Gerald Salente, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:58:30.391 --> 02:58:32.271]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[02:58:32.331 --> 02:58:32.732]  Thank you.
[02:58:33.052 --> 02:58:33.852]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:33.972 --> 02:58:35.312]  Always great being on your show.
[02:58:35.592 --> 02:58:36.112]  God bless you.
[02:58:36.192 --> 02:58:37.072]  It's always great having you.
[02:58:37.293 --> 02:58:38.453]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:58:38.593 --> 02:58:39.713]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:39.993 --> 02:58:40.913]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:43.114 --> 02:58:45.294]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.714 --> 02:58:48.515]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.530 --> 02:58:54.132]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.532 --> 02:58:59.516]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.877 --> 02:59:01.598]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:01.918 --> 02:59:06.742]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:06.922 --> 02:59:07.843]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.083 --> 02:59:08.844]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.224 --> 02:59:10.825]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.106 --> 02:59:11.926]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.186 --> 02:59:14.248]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.388 --> 02:59:15.489]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.729 --> 02:59:17.070]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.251 --> 02:59:22.315]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.515 --> 02:59:25.698]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.118 --> 02:59:29.581]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:29.921 --> 02:59:30.901]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.141 --> 02:59:31.761]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.041 --> 02:59:32.962]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.142 --> 02:59:33.882]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.082 --> 02:59:34.922]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.182 --> 02:59:37.923]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.223 --> 02:59:38.583]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.743 --> 02:59:40.403]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.423 --> 02:59:41.403]  Again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.423 --> 02:59:42.584]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.624 --> 02:59:44.444]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:09.515 --> 03:00:19.266]  We've got a few minutes left with Manny Medea, then we've got the legend, if I can do the word, Jebber Griffin joining us in the Mouth of the Hour and the folks that have been holding that you're going to talk to Griffin.
[03:00:19.286 --> 03:00:20.488]  So, we save the best for last.
[03:00:20.508 --> 03:00:22.791]  You get to hold, we get to talk to him.
[03:00:22.811 --> 03:00:26.735]  We all want to hear from everybody and appreciate folks that went to get the calls earlier in the hour.
[03:00:26.755 --> 03:00:30.019]  I was just covering all the eugenics news, never got around to some of those calls.
[03:00:31.568 --> 03:00:32.990]  Going back to Manny Medeo.
[03:00:33.070 --> 03:00:34.512]  Okay, so you're in this meeting.
[03:00:34.532 --> 03:00:36.114]  Tell us where it was, what was happening.
[03:00:36.395 --> 03:00:38.517]  You're writing an article for InfoWars.com.
[03:00:38.537 --> 03:00:40.140]  We're gonna get very, very soon.
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:41.702]  Just make sure I don't miss that when it comes.
[03:00:41.722 --> 03:00:44.866]  In fact, ballpark, when are we getting that article so we can post it, Manny?
[03:00:45.683 --> 03:00:47.545]  You're going to be getting that within the next couple of days.
[03:00:47.585 --> 03:00:55.030]  I'm still waiting to hear back from the prosecution team that asked me to email them about this evidence, which could very easily be found by simple internet searches.
[03:00:55.371 --> 03:00:56.332]  Well, they always say that.
[03:00:56.372 --> 03:00:59.174]  And we didn't know that Bin Laden had been CIA.
[03:00:59.314 --> 03:01:00.995]  It's just BBC, AP, Reuters.
[03:01:01.015 --> 03:01:03.277]  But we didn't know NORAD stood down that day.
[03:01:03.297 --> 03:01:06.039]  And there were drills of hijacked jets flying into the buildings.
[03:01:06.380 --> 03:01:08.581]  But all that aside, where were you?
[03:01:08.641 --> 03:01:09.362]  You got invited.
[03:01:09.802 --> 03:01:10.843]  What else did you ask them?
[03:01:10.863 --> 03:01:13.045]  Because you told us in the end they were telling you, shut up.
[03:01:13.979 --> 03:01:16.580]  Yeah, essentially they were saying, listen, where did you get that from?
[03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:17.420]  You email us.
[03:01:17.460 --> 03:01:17.840]  That's it.
[03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:18.220]  That's it.
[03:01:18.721 --> 03:01:19.961]  You know, it comes down to this.
[03:01:20.261 --> 03:01:32.485]  I brought up the fact that the Saudi, the case that the family members brought all the way to the Supreme Court, that the Supreme Court refused to listen to as of last week.
[03:01:33.295 --> 03:01:35.817]  7,000 family members with the evidence against Saudi Arabia.
[03:01:35.837 --> 03:01:40.801]  I asked them how strong of a case they would have had if they had that evidence.
[03:01:41.142 --> 03:01:44.444]  I also said to them, 70% of our questions were never answered during the commission.
[03:01:44.484 --> 03:01:52.191]  Is this going to be another sham trial that the family members then have to go through and then expect to have some sort of justice?
[03:01:52.511 --> 03:01:56.835]  And I said to them this, I said, does anybody here really feel that it was only five people that did this?
[03:01:58.314 --> 03:01:58.755]  Silence.
[03:01:59.255 --> 03:02:07.903]  Alex, there had to be at least four or five times of silence, and that's why it's so important that the mission of nyccan.org is accomplished.
[03:02:08.263 --> 03:02:12.968]  Exactly, and we'll have you back on about that, but I want to continue in the limited time with this.
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:19.523]  Because talking to you over the phone, my producer said that you also said at one point they just said, look, be quiet, shut up.
[03:02:19.843 --> 03:02:20.963]  We've heard enough from you.
[03:02:21.063 --> 03:02:22.704]  Where did you hear this information?
[03:02:22.744 --> 03:02:23.284]  Exactly.
[03:02:23.324 --> 03:02:25.105]  They were asking me where it came from.
[03:02:25.185 --> 03:02:27.246]  I was telling them this is AP Reuters sourced.
[03:02:27.266 --> 03:02:29.648]  I was telling them this comes from intelligence agencies.
[03:02:29.688 --> 03:02:41.073]  The Indian intelligence agency actually spoke about... Did you tell them about Stringman, the head of the visa in Saudi Arabia, and he's being told, let Adam and them in, they're CIA?
[03:02:43.197 --> 03:02:47.841]  That I didn't have an opportunity to, but this is something else that I can continue to correspond with him on.
[03:02:47.861 --> 03:02:48.881]  I'm going to tell you something real quick.
[03:02:48.901 --> 03:02:52.044]  I mean, this is on record that the hijackers were all trained at U.S.
[03:02:52.064 --> 03:02:54.446]  military bases in super high clearance.
[03:02:54.726 --> 03:02:55.567]  That's AP.
[03:02:55.967 --> 03:02:57.468]  I mean, this is a fact.
[03:02:58.028 --> 03:03:00.390]  I mean, that the embassies wouldn't let them in, and they'd say, let them in.
[03:03:00.410 --> 03:03:01.831]  These are high-level operatives.
[03:03:02.091 --> 03:03:03.092]  Yes, sir!
[03:03:03.352 --> 03:03:05.014]  I mean, case closed.
[03:03:05.074 --> 03:03:05.634]  They did it.
[03:03:05.734 --> 03:03:06.215]  It's over.
[03:03:08.317 --> 03:03:17.565]  I actually, and I commented a few times to a few of my close friends about how the next night I was on a conference call with Candace Gorman.
[03:03:18.026 --> 03:03:26.074]  She is one of the defendants of three of the people that are being accused during the sham 9-11 trial that's taking place starting this week down in Guantanamo.
[03:03:26.614 --> 03:03:28.855]  So I listened to her conference call.
[03:03:28.875 --> 03:03:36.580]  I had an opportunity to ask questions there and I said, you know, what type of facts is the government bringing up and how do you feel you can successfully defend them?
[03:03:36.820 --> 03:03:39.701]  She goes, I know I can defend them because there are no facts they're bringing up.
[03:03:39.721 --> 03:03:40.562]  That's all you're saying.
[03:03:40.962 --> 03:03:42.803]  So, you know, I thought about this Alex.
[03:03:42.843 --> 03:03:43.964]  I was one of maybe
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:49.861]  You also told us that they admitted they have no evidence, but Obama admits that.
[03:03:49.941 --> 03:03:53.522]  He says, they may be found not guilty, but we're still gonna keep them.
[03:03:53.542 --> 03:03:54.942]  I mean, that's freedom!
[03:04:14.577 --> 03:04:16.438]  Well, I mean, this is what happens.
[03:04:16.518 --> 03:04:26.845]  We have the Military Commissions Act, we have the Patriot Act, we have all these different acts which are constantly suffocating Americans' rights and the Constitution.
[03:04:27.065 --> 03:04:27.986]  What are we going to do about it?
[03:04:28.006 --> 03:04:31.988]  Are we going to stand up and do something about it like you, myself, and so many others are doing?
[03:04:32.008 --> 03:04:34.290]  Or are we going to sit back and say, okay, let them do this?
[03:04:34.390 --> 03:04:34.550]  No.
[03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:35.851]  Now is the time to act.
[03:04:35.951 --> 03:04:37.992]  You are a badass for freedom.
[03:04:38.012 --> 03:04:43.876]  I know you've got some secret stuff you can't talk about right now, but we'll have you on next week or at the end of the week.
[03:04:44.542 --> 03:04:45.283]  Thank you, sir.
[03:04:45.343 --> 03:04:45.744]  Thank you, sir.
[03:05:00.802 --> 03:05:05.969]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:05:06.109 --> 03:05:10.475]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:05:10.635 --> 03:05:12.498]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:05:12.918 --> 03:05:14.260]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:05:14.520 --> 03:05:15.562]  There is a solution.
[03:05:15.802 --> 03:05:23.804]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:06:01.859 --> 03:06:03.240]  It is a big idea.
[03:06:03.260 --> 03:06:05.381]  A new world order.
[03:06:06.101 --> 03:06:10.443]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:06:10.990 --> 03:06:13.112]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:06:13.813 --> 03:06:16.055]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:06:16.596 --> 03:06:19.038]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:06:19.779 --> 03:06:27.087]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:06:30.134 --> 03:06:35.097]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:06:35.558 --> 03:06:39.040]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:41.922]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:06:42.002 --> 03:06:43.143]  Most people have no idea.
[03:06:43.183 --> 03:06:43.923]  They're not after money.
[03:06:43.963 --> 03:06:45.044]  They have all the money they need.
[03:06:45.244 --> 03:06:45.965]  They're after power.
[03:06:46.225 --> 03:06:47.025]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:07:00.094 --> 03:07:01.394]  Yeah.
[03:07:01.414 --> 03:07:08.697]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:07:08.937 --> 03:07:13.218]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:07:13.438 --> 03:07:18.300]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[03:07:18.600 --> 03:07:25.282]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your healthy
[03:07:25.322 --> 03:07:25.562]  I think so.
[03:07:56.102 --> 03:07:59.064]  269-409-1776 today!
[03:08:02.025 --> 03:08:07.108]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show!
[03:08:07.428 --> 03:08:09.729]  Because there's a war on for your mind!
[03:08:27.998 --> 03:08:33.271]  Well, G. Edward Griffin with Freedom Force International is an icon.
[03:08:34.312 --> 03:08:36.674]  In the liberty and freedom movement, the anti-nuclear war movement.
[03:08:37.214 --> 03:08:55.186]  In fact, he's probably the greatest living person out there who continually, on a large scale, on a big platform, has made scores of films, presentations, best-selling books, creature from Jekyll Island, traveling the country, the world, fighting the globalists.
[03:08:55.447 --> 03:09:01.791]  And we stand on his shoulders today, but he also stands right beside us because he's still fighting more than ever.
[03:09:02.819 --> 03:09:05.041]  He's a great gentleman and very articulate.
[03:09:05.562 --> 03:09:10.026]  And I'm very excited that he's going to be interviewed in my newest Obama film.
[03:09:10.446 --> 03:09:15.871]  He is the last interview for this film that has 14 interviews right now.
[03:09:16.792 --> 03:09:18.474]  And one of them is a big surprise interview.
[03:09:18.514 --> 03:09:20.095]  I'm going to leave until right before it's released.
[03:09:20.155 --> 03:09:25.901]  But just so many great people in this film.
[03:09:27.546 --> 03:09:29.708]  And so, we're very excited about that.
[03:09:29.748 --> 03:09:32.951]  Also, Jason Burmese is going out there interviewing him.
[03:09:33.111 --> 03:09:39.458]  He's going to be in Burmese's film, Invisible Empire, with a big role in that, exposing kind of the architecture of the New World Order.
[03:09:39.898 --> 03:09:41.700]  But this just broke over the weekend.
[03:09:41.820 --> 03:09:44.182]  World Net Daily's kind of copied our story, which we're glad.
[03:09:44.523 --> 03:09:45.624]  All we care about is exposing it.
[03:09:46.204 --> 03:09:51.465]  The original place was Front Page Magazine in February, but nobody believed it because David Horowitz is somewhat discredited.
[03:09:51.765 --> 03:09:53.265]  But we got the actual textbook.
[03:09:53.305 --> 03:09:56.446]  We have the scans of it, and it's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:09:56.826 --> 03:10:12.669]  Obama's science advisor called for planetary regime to enforce totalitarian population control, implants to control us, CPS taking all children at birth, a planetary government of green police, forced drugging of the water,
[03:10:13.917 --> 03:10:35.177]  uh... and of the food and and and this is a government plan the book is as you see on screen at prison planet dot tv eco science population resources environment and uh... this was he co-wrote this with paul r who was one of bush's chief advisors so this is bipartisan
[03:10:36.045 --> 03:10:42.716]  Uh, but Front Page Magazine and the Neocons are acting like it's a liberal issue, though I have to admit the Democrats are more overtly eugenicists.
[03:10:42.756 --> 03:10:46.703]  You know, Margaret Sanger is praised by the black community because she called blacks subhuman.
[03:10:47.183 --> 03:10:48.446]  That's the sick, twisted...
[03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:56.725]  Crate like Schwarzenegger gets ADL awards because he says he wants to be like Hitler, but if you fight Hitler, then the ADL attacks you.
[03:10:57.065 --> 03:11:00.247]  Reality is much stranger than fiction, as they say.
[03:11:00.827 --> 03:11:14.976]  So I wanted to get G. Edward Griffin out of the gates to talk about this, but overall, the big eugenics agenda, the plan, the carbon tax, which we couldn't see until they passed it, home inspections, federal zoning,
[03:11:16.718 --> 03:11:17.762]  One child policies.
[03:11:17.822 --> 03:11:18.686]  I have USA Today.
[03:11:21.175 --> 03:11:22.136]  Well, thanks for inviting me, Alex.
[03:11:22.156 --> 03:11:29.440]  I really appreciate that very kind introduction, but it scares the heck out of me because I think people expect too much.
[03:11:50.570 --> 03:11:51.811]  No brag, just fact.
[03:11:51.851 --> 03:11:52.951]  That's what John Wayne said.
[03:11:52.971 --> 03:11:56.873]  People need to know the testament of the great work you've done in 40 plus years.
[03:11:56.973 --> 03:11:59.074]  In fact, briefly, how long have you been fighting the globalists?
[03:11:59.355 --> 03:12:00.235]  How'd you wake up to them?
[03:12:00.255 --> 03:12:01.296]  And then let's get into eugenics.
[03:12:01.456 --> 03:12:05.258]  Well, the actual year of my beginning of awakening was 1959.
[03:12:06.938 --> 03:12:11.000]  And that's when I began to read some things that were, you know, upstream.
[03:12:11.421 --> 03:12:14.262]  That's not the same stuff that I was seeing on the media.
[03:12:15.082 --> 03:12:17.664]  And by 1960, I was in full swing.
[03:12:18.104 --> 03:12:19.365]  So I've been in those things since 1960.
[03:12:21.773 --> 03:12:22.293]  Amazing.
[03:12:22.333 --> 03:12:24.015]  So we're talking about almost 50 years.
[03:12:24.195 --> 03:12:24.435]  Yeah.
[03:12:24.695 --> 03:12:24.935]  Really.
[03:12:26.616 --> 03:12:27.277]  Time flies.
[03:12:27.297 --> 03:12:29.498]  You know, I hope I look as good as you when I'm your age.
[03:12:29.538 --> 03:12:32.320]  You're a... What a gentleman you are.
[03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:33.101]  No, no, no.
[03:12:33.121 --> 03:12:33.841]  You're a handsome devil.
[03:12:33.881 --> 03:12:35.002]  I'll just send you a pair of glasses.
[03:12:37.111 --> 03:12:40.613]  Okay, and we're going to fire up your website coming up in a few minutes, so folks, you get ready for that.
[03:12:40.653 --> 03:12:44.796]  You have Freedom Force International taking action against these globalists, but eugenics.
[03:12:45.237 --> 03:12:47.558]  I mean, in my research, everything leads to that.
[03:12:47.858 --> 03:12:51.781]  Our entire society is built for a social engineering grid.
[03:12:51.861 --> 03:12:59.866]  Break that down from your 60 years of research and what their endgame is in light of this government textbook, internal textbook.
[03:12:59.946 --> 03:13:06.851]  It's now come out, written by Bush's advisor and Obama's advisor, calling for a planetary government to kill us.
[03:13:08.292 --> 03:13:23.618]  Well, I had two thoughts as you were introducing the topic, and one of the thoughts is that even though I was not aware of this very latest development which you announced, it does not surprise me in the least because it's just more of the same.
[03:13:23.718 --> 03:13:27.200]  So the first thought has to do with, if you understand what the
[03:13:27.500 --> 03:13:32.284]  The ideology is of these people who have been running our government for many years.
[03:13:32.944 --> 03:13:34.225]  It's called collectivism.
[03:13:34.645 --> 03:13:42.631]  And if you understand what that entails, then you know right away what these people are going to do, because that's based upon their ideology.
[03:13:42.692 --> 03:13:47.075]  The ideology is that they must have total control over the entire population.
[03:13:47.555 --> 03:13:47.816]  Thank you.
[03:14:03.713 --> 03:14:05.914]  Well, then you can predict what's going to happen.
[03:14:05.934 --> 03:14:10.457]  They're going to want to control not only your health, but your reproductive rights.
[03:14:10.997 --> 03:14:14.660]  They'll control who will survive and who will be exterminated.
[03:14:14.700 --> 03:14:23.925]  They'll control what you do for a living, where you live, how much you eat, what you think, you know, all of these things, because you become a cog in a giant machine.
[03:14:24.365 --> 03:14:29.288]  So, the first thought that crossed my mind was that, okay, well, here comes eugenics again.
[03:14:29.308 --> 03:14:30.169]  That's always happened.
[03:14:30.809 --> 03:14:43.060]  In every collectivist regime on this planet, whether it's communism or fascism and Nazism, or some of these other isms in Asia and Africa right now, that's part of the animal.
[03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:43.841]  That's what it does.
[03:14:44.511 --> 03:14:48.875]  The other thought is, you mentioned it, is that this is not a partisan issue at all.
[03:14:49.615 --> 03:14:56.461]  You'll find this mentality in both the Republican and the Democrat parties because both parties are dominated by collectivists.
[03:14:56.941 --> 03:15:04.628]  So, one of the things we have to do is strip out that concept that Republicans and Democrats oppose each other on anything significant.
[03:15:05.188 --> 03:15:07.470]  So, those are the thoughts that cross my mind.
[03:15:07.710 --> 03:15:13.335]  You know, once people get the picture of this, so they understand that collectivism is the great destroyer of their freedom,
[03:15:13.936 --> 03:15:19.547]  Then they won't fall for this nonsense about, well, are they Republicans or are they Democrats doing this?
[03:15:22.098 --> 03:15:45.192]  I want you to elaborate on this, because you have these big monopoly capitalists who always advertise their free market, but really what they want is big governments, big systems to shut down their competition and bring in control, and then because they are collectivists, they collect our wealth and give it to themselves, and then use the little bit they give back to us to domesticate us, then why should they even want us here?
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:52.255]  In their collectivist model of everything shared, well they want to get rid of people so there's more for the few that are left.
[03:15:52.335 --> 03:15:54.641]  This is their whole social engineering goal.
[03:15:55.418 --> 03:15:58.800]  Well, there is a certain element of that in their thinking.
[03:15:58.820 --> 03:16:05.444]  They do want to limit the population because they're afraid that if the population gets too large, it becomes unmanageable.
[03:16:06.225 --> 03:16:09.306]  Their primary concern is how to manage the population.
[03:16:09.807 --> 03:16:15.130]  Like a herd of cattle, if the herd gets too big, you know, you have trouble managing it.
[03:16:15.190 --> 03:16:18.992]  It could break out of the boundaries of the North 40 someplace.
[03:16:19.212 --> 03:16:23.155]  So there's a certain element to keep the size of the herd down.
[03:16:23.735 --> 03:16:27.117]  But the other element is that they need workers.
[03:16:27.417 --> 03:16:35.742]  They want people out there producing and serving so that they can create all of the fine things of life which the elite will enjoy.
[03:16:36.062 --> 03:16:39.063]  They want a working class and they want a servitude class.
[03:16:39.244 --> 03:16:40.304]  And they want our women.
[03:16:40.324 --> 03:16:42.946]  They don't want to kill all of us, just 80%.
[03:16:44.346 --> 03:16:48.348]  Well, I don't know what the number is, but whatever it is, they have no qualms about it.
[03:16:48.429 --> 03:16:49.129]  That's for sure.
[03:16:50.410 --> 03:16:54.915]  Well, you know, the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 96 says a world population reduction of 80%.
[03:16:54.955 --> 03:16:58.218]  80 is the number you get from Ted Turner and people.
[03:16:58.779 --> 03:17:00.961]  But yeah, I mean, some say even more, some say less.
[03:17:01.441 --> 03:17:05.526]  Yeah, whatever it is, if they wanted to reduce it 5%, the principle is the same.
[03:17:07.387 --> 03:17:09.089]  Yeah, which is total dictatorial power.
[03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:10.671]  Yeah, over who lives and who dies.
[03:17:12.608 --> 03:17:16.693]  How would you say their program's going right now, watching it closely for 60 years?
[03:17:16.713 --> 03:17:28.629]  I mean, to me, watching it for 15 or so, it looks like they've got the power, they're steering things, but they don't have total control, and as they build their New World Order, it's falling apart as fast as they build it.
[03:17:29.505 --> 03:17:31.546]  Well, yes, I can see elements of that.
[03:17:31.746 --> 03:17:48.034]  It's certainly not all in the bag, that's for sure, but I see it as an accelerating process and it worries the heck out of me because once the dam starts to break, and it looks to me like it's breaking up now, the pieces falling out start
[03:17:48.945 --> 03:17:58.689]  Becoming larger and they start falling faster and so this great this great outpouring of water from behind the dam when I when I say that I'm thinking of our freedoms.
[03:17:59.089 --> 03:18:07.952]  Our freedoms are being flooded out through a huge breach in the dam and it seems to be going faster and faster and so I'm very concerned about that.
[03:18:08.012 --> 03:18:13.514]  We could come up with some event or series of events almost any day which they could justify.
[03:18:13.534 --> 03:18:15.155]  They could use as justification.
[03:18:15.755 --> 03:18:18.536]  Or, you know, closing down at what's left of our freedoms.
[03:18:18.556 --> 03:18:20.737]  They're definitely planning to do that.
[03:18:21.037 --> 03:18:25.679]  It's just a question of when are they going to do it and what events are they going to use for that.
[03:18:25.959 --> 03:18:30.561]  But by the same token, as you say, it looks like their system is falling apart.
[03:18:30.801 --> 03:18:33.122]  There's certainly a lot of disagreement among them.
[03:18:33.442 --> 03:18:39.925]  There's a lot of infighting between them to see who is going to have the ultimate power
[03:18:40.906 --> 03:18:41.946]  But I guess that's part of it.
[03:18:41.966 --> 03:18:56.419]  They've got to destroy a lot of stuff to build the new system, where if they destroy everything, then only their central hubs are left, and so by extension, by the rule of heavenly bodies or gravitational pull, it will pull everything into it.
[03:18:56.679 --> 03:18:58.541]  Yeah, that's a perfect analogy, I think.
[03:18:58.661 --> 03:19:04.006]  And also, we have to remember that certain subgroups within the collectivist movement
[03:19:04.586 --> 03:19:09.311]  And I think that kind of actually pigeonholes them and trips them up a lot.
[03:19:31.621 --> 03:19:33.104]  Well, let's hope it does.
[03:19:33.865 --> 03:19:40.937]  The point is, I think, to all of this is that we certainly cannot sit back and just wait for it to crumble because they've got plans for us that we're not going to like.
[03:19:40.957 --> 03:19:42.821]  We have to fight this with everything we have.
[03:19:43.837 --> 03:19:53.919]  Well, let's talk about what the plans are, versus our plans, and also how you see the economic collapse, engineered or not, what's happening with the global carbon tax, what life will be like under that.
[03:19:54.640 --> 03:20:00.221]  I mean, this is the actual Soviet Union is what I'd call it we're going into, but we'll get Jim Griffiths' take on that in just a moment.
[03:20:00.241 --> 03:20:01.001]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.401 --> 03:20:04.362]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?

[03:20:22.671 --> 03:20:22.971]  I think so.

[03:22:01.796 --> 03:22:07.258]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:22:07.518 --> 03:22:08.799]  And we knew what to do.
[03:22:08.859 --> 03:22:10.619]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:22:10.840 --> 03:22:17.262]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:22:17.863 --> 03:22:18.243]  Whitman!
[03:22:19.455 --> 03:22:26.438]  EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:22:26.778 --> 03:22:33.581]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:22:33.881 --> 03:22:36.922]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:22:37.042 --> 03:22:42.305]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:22:42.825 --> 03:22:45.386]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[03:22:54.874 --> 03:22:59.823]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:23:01.445 --> 03:23:03.106]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[03:23:03.366 --> 03:23:08.109]  You might have the food, water, gold, and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?

[03:23:51.406 --> 03:23:51.646]  Watch me!
[03:24:10.643 --> 03:24:13.505]  G. Ever Griffin's our guest icon in the fight for liberty.
[03:24:15.086 --> 03:24:17.288]  So excited about him in my new Obama film.
[03:24:17.328 --> 03:24:18.329]  I'll soon announce the name.
[03:24:18.349 --> 03:24:22.292]  And he's gonna be in Burmese's Visible Empire film.
[03:24:22.392 --> 03:24:23.613]  So we're going out to California interviewing.
[03:24:24.413 --> 03:24:25.114]  Well, my team is.
[03:24:25.134 --> 03:24:29.597]  I'm going out to California separately right before they go for another interview.
[03:24:29.637 --> 03:24:30.658]  I'll just leave that unnamed.
[03:24:30.698 --> 03:24:34.601]  But going back to G. Ever Griffin in this short segment.
[03:24:37.008 --> 03:24:38.149]  I mean, there's so many questions.
[03:24:39.329 --> 03:24:52.195]  Your take on the banking implosion, Federal Reserve to get power over all industry, the green taxes, the carbon taxes, home inspections, federal zoning where it says they can just take your house, no judge, no jury, that's in there?
[03:24:52.215 --> 03:25:00.659]  I mean, it looks like on every front, federalization of water, gun control, they're moving on every front right now.
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:02.420]  Is this...
[03:25:03.772 --> 03:25:06.134]  A bum rush where we're getting hit with so much?
[03:25:06.154 --> 03:25:08.116]  I mean, why are they moving so quick right now?
[03:25:09.617 --> 03:25:12.960]  Well, I guess it's because they want to tie it up as quickly as possible, Alex.
[03:25:13.661 --> 03:25:20.747]  You know, they don't want to allow the people too much time to think about it and to develop opposition.
[03:25:21.027 --> 03:25:21.828]  And we get it all done!
[03:25:22.408 --> 03:25:29.134]  Right now, I think it's come to the end, almost to the end of the honeymoon in the Obama administration in the first few months.
[03:25:31.015 --> 03:25:32.817]  They could do just about anything they wanted to.
[03:25:32.837 --> 03:25:34.899]  People would say, well, we don't know.
[03:25:34.959 --> 03:25:35.539]  Give them a chance.
[03:25:35.579 --> 03:25:36.800]  Let them work it out and so forth.
[03:25:36.860 --> 03:25:42.285]  And they know that they didn't get too much done right away that later on opposition might be developed to it.
[03:25:42.305 --> 03:25:43.306]  So I think that's part of it.
[03:25:43.786 --> 03:25:49.251]  And the other thing is, it's got a lot more to do with this one administration versus another administration.
[03:25:49.851 --> 03:25:57.694]  These people who are dreaming up this legislation and writing these laws, they're not thinking as Republicans or Democrats.
[03:25:57.714 --> 03:26:01.976]  They're thinking as globalist collectivists trying to create the New World Order.
[03:26:02.256 --> 03:26:03.016]  That's their mission.
[03:26:03.336 --> 03:26:04.597]  They want to get that thing built.
[03:26:04.897 --> 03:26:06.277]  They want to get on with it, you know?
[03:26:06.297 --> 03:26:07.598]  That's their dream.
[03:26:08.278 --> 03:26:14.006]  And meanwhile, all the folks back here at home are still thinking in terms of these people, well why would a good Republican do that?
[03:26:14.046 --> 03:26:15.568]  Or why would a good Democrat do that?
[03:26:16.109 --> 03:26:20.474]  And they don't get it, that this has got nothing at all to do with partisan politics.
[03:26:20.695 --> 03:26:26.282]  So I think they're in a hurry so that too many of the American people don't wake up and get it all done.
[03:26:33.890 --> 03:26:42.216]  Well, I don't know what more I could say about that, except that we're living in a time where events are moving very rapidly.
[03:26:42.236 --> 03:26:54.185]  I guess people have always said that throughout history, but also I think that it's true that because of technology, things do move more rapidly as the years go by.
[03:26:55.021 --> 03:27:03.085]  And I think the time that they figure to wrap up the New World Order is definitely within this generation.
[03:27:03.925 --> 03:27:09.628]  It used to be, I think, that they were thinking in terms of, well, two or three generations down the line, we'll get it all done.
[03:27:09.648 --> 03:27:17.712]  But now I think they've decided it's this generation, which means within this 20-year time span, probably less than that.
[03:27:18.953 --> 03:27:21.114]  And so it's moving very rapidly.
[03:27:22.188 --> 03:27:27.870]  And we were talking just a moment ago about, can we turn this around?
[03:27:27.890 --> 03:27:28.490]  Are we going to win?
[03:27:28.510 --> 03:27:29.190]  Are we going to lose?
[03:27:29.230 --> 03:27:29.890]  What's going to happen?
[03:27:29.910 --> 03:27:31.971]  Everybody wants to think, what do I do?
[03:27:32.031 --> 03:27:32.771]  How do I prepare?
[03:27:32.891 --> 03:27:34.071]  What can I do for my family?
[03:27:34.471 --> 03:27:35.272]  All of these things.
[03:27:36.012 --> 03:27:38.653]  And nothing wrong with that kind of thinking.
[03:27:38.713 --> 03:27:39.873]  It's realistic thinking.
[03:27:40.569 --> 03:27:43.570]  But the main question is, are we going to win or are we going to lose?
[03:27:43.630 --> 03:27:50.653]  And my feeling is very strong on that, is that we are definitely going to win this battle, because freedom will always win out.
[03:27:51.074 --> 03:27:54.175]  But the question, the annoying question is, how long will it take?
[03:27:54.635 --> 03:27:56.816]  Is it going to be by the next election?
[03:27:56.836 --> 03:27:58.797]  No, it's definitely not going to be that long.
[03:27:59.177 --> 03:28:00.900]  Yeah, how bad is it going to get?
[03:28:00.920 --> 03:28:08.289]  And one big problem with winning is people are in this instant gratification, give me the Wendy's hamburger in 10 seconds or I'm angry.
[03:28:08.309 --> 03:28:10.051]  I catch myself even like this.
[03:28:10.471 --> 03:28:12.734]  It takes time to grow a orchard.
[03:28:13.154 --> 03:28:14.696]  It takes time to put in a garden.
[03:28:14.756 --> 03:28:17.059]  It takes time to build a new old order.
[03:28:17.079 --> 03:28:18.341]  It takes time to defeat it.
[03:28:19.057 --> 03:28:20.798]  And things are moving very quickly now.
[03:28:20.838 --> 03:28:22.218]  We're having great victories.
[03:28:22.538 --> 03:28:26.639]  People need to be more positive and realize things don't happen instantly.
[03:28:26.679 --> 03:28:27.319]  And I agree with you.
[03:28:27.339 --> 03:28:27.999]  We're going to win.
[03:28:28.400 --> 03:28:30.060]  The question is how bad will it get?
[03:28:30.400 --> 03:28:31.660]  How many of us will be enslaved?
[03:28:31.701 --> 03:28:33.661]  And we talk about if they win, what is it like?
[03:28:34.301 --> 03:28:38.282]  It's like living under Joe Stalin with a high-tech overlay, isn't it, G. Evergreen?
[03:28:38.302 --> 03:28:39.643]  Yeah, I think that's a good analogy.
[03:28:39.743 --> 03:28:40.963]  Yes, high-tech overlay.
[03:28:41.563 --> 03:28:48.005]  A lot more effective means of controlling people, controlling their thoughts, controlling their health, their movement.
[03:28:48.645 --> 03:28:52.786]  And a lot more sophisticated weapons to put down opposition.
[03:28:53.046 --> 03:28:55.786]  Yeah, that's the high-tech overlay that makes it really scary.
[03:28:56.967 --> 03:29:00.607]  But, yes, back to the theme, which is, how long is it going to take?
[03:29:00.908 --> 03:29:08.129]  That's been one of the main points of Freedom Force International, is that we have the long view of history, and a lot of people get very impatient with that.
[03:29:08.409 --> 03:29:09.349]  I can understand that.
[03:29:09.809 --> 03:29:13.210]  I used to be impatient with that point of view when I was a young guy.
[03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:17.151]  I remember we were talking a moment ago, when did I start down this path?
[03:29:17.211 --> 03:29:18.231]  Well, back in 1960.
[03:29:19.071 --> 03:29:24.413]  And I remember back in the 60s, listening to some of the old timers say, well, this is going to take quite a while to turn around.
[03:29:24.453 --> 03:29:26.053]  And I kept saying, the heck it is.
[03:29:26.253 --> 03:29:27.133]  Wait till I get in there.
[03:29:27.173 --> 03:29:29.294]  You know, I'll turn this thing around right away.
[03:29:29.734 --> 03:29:32.415]  Well, turns out that the old timers were right.
[03:29:33.775 --> 03:29:36.558]  It turns out, hold on, 60 years is a blink of an eye, though.
[03:29:36.918 --> 03:29:38.719]  You've done a lot to start turning the ship.
[03:29:39.060 --> 03:29:41.702]  You have influenced tens of millions, G. Edward Griffin.
[03:29:42.022 --> 03:29:42.843]  Stay there, my friend.
[03:29:42.903 --> 03:29:43.283]  Quick break.
[03:29:43.303 --> 03:29:48.668]  We'll come right back with G. Edward Griffin.
[03:29:51.751 --> 03:29:52.692]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.712 --> 03:29:54.774]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.674 --> 03:29:58.377]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.998 --> 03:30:04.982]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.242 --> 03:30:07.024]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.244 --> 03:30:15.532]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.773 --> 03:30:20.998]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.318 --> 03:30:22.940]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.160 --> 03:30:29.502]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.682 --> 03:30:40.444]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.724 --> 03:30:41.244]  That's right.
[03:30:41.505 --> 03:30:43.825]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:30:44.065 --> 03:30:45.646]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[03:30:47.586 --> 03:30:47.987]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[03:31:04.662 --> 03:31:10.084]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[03:31:10.465 --> 03:31:18.108]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[03:31:18.809 --> 03:31:25.873]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[03:31:26.254 --> 03:31:37.660]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[03:31:38.001 --> 03:31:41.523]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[03:31:41.963 --> 03:31:43.624]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[03:31:44.224 --> 03:31:48.067]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[03:32:03.507 --> 03:32:06.150]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[03:32:06.571 --> 03:32:08.853]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[03:32:09.234 --> 03:32:12.557]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal foods.
[03:32:12.978 --> 03:32:19.325]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[03:32:19.665 --> 03:32:20.105]  We're good to go.
[03:32:40.981 --> 03:32:41.301]  We're good.
[03:33:07.317 --> 03:33:28.018]  You take a mortal man You put him in control And put him in control Watch him become a god Watch people's heads a roll
[03:33:32.938 --> 03:33:35.639]  Just like the Pied Piper, turn rats loose.
[03:33:35.659 --> 03:33:36.619]  Elite create their own crises.
[03:33:36.639 --> 03:33:39.480]  Then once you start playing to their tune, crank it up!
[03:33:39.500 --> 03:33:42.921]  Just like the Pied Piper, let rats rule the streets.
[03:33:42.981 --> 03:34:00.065]  Dance like a marionette, swaying to the symphony of destruction.
[03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:04.532]  Acting like a robot.
[03:34:09.055 --> 03:34:11.277]  It's metal brain corrodes.
[03:34:15.680 --> 03:34:18.682]  You try to take his balls.
[03:34:22.705 --> 03:34:24.827]  Before the head explodes.
[03:34:27.428 --> 03:34:30.271]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to G. Edward Griffin.
[03:34:30.312 --> 03:34:39.882]  G. Edward, fire out the website for folks who want to check out all your great films and books and videos and materials and people who want to get involved in Freedom Force International.
[03:34:41.103 --> 03:34:41.304]  Well...
[03:34:42.051 --> 03:34:42.891]  How do they do that?
[03:34:43.011 --> 03:34:46.133]  I guess it's time to plug a couple of websites.
[03:34:47.794 --> 03:34:55.877]  Our commercial website, as you know, it's called The Reality Zone, and that's easy to remember, realityzone.com.
[03:34:55.897 --> 03:35:03.461]  We've got about a hundred different items there, some of my books and video programs, audio recordings, plus we carry the good stuff from other people as well.
[03:35:03.961 --> 03:35:06.062]  But that's the commercial site, plenty of information.
[03:35:06.622 --> 03:35:13.167]  If you're a reader or you like to watch videos, there's enough there for almost a year of your time of study.
[03:35:13.727 --> 03:35:24.095]  But if you want to get involved in an organization that's trying to do something about it and trying to recapture control of our political system, then you want to go to the Freedom Force site.
[03:35:24.656 --> 03:35:27.037]  And that's freedomforceinternational.org.
[03:35:28.463 --> 03:35:35.070]  And I can't tell you too much about it because it takes too much time to tell you about it, except that there's a plan there to do something about it.
[03:35:35.530 --> 03:35:46.321]  To not just complain, not just to read another book, but to actually acquire, or reacquire I should say, reacquire power over the political system of all of the countries.
[03:35:46.341 --> 03:35:46.721]  That's right.
[03:35:46.741 --> 03:35:50.345]  We have to infiltrate the system like they've done to us.
[03:35:51.325 --> 03:35:55.846]  I wouldn't say infiltrate, that's got a negative connotation to it.
[03:35:55.886 --> 03:35:57.867]  We should be there all the time anyway.
[03:35:58.207 --> 03:36:09.809]  No, I agree, but I mean, they covertly infiltrated, and I think in a war, it's good to be overt, but if people choose to be covert, and we get sent a lot of secret documents, and I mean, that is infiltration.
[03:36:10.169 --> 03:36:12.810]  That's the American people re-infiltrating their own government.
[03:36:13.581 --> 03:36:15.402]  Well, I have to agree with the principle.
[03:36:15.442 --> 03:36:18.464]  We have to go back to where we should have been all along.
[03:36:19.225 --> 03:36:27.209]  When you've got self-government, you better be involved in government, not just turn it over to somebody else, because then it's not self-government anymore.
[03:36:27.310 --> 03:36:28.030]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:39.457]  The government that's out of control and illegitimate and owned by offshore banks publicly now, in fraud, they act like we are criminal infiltrators and we try to go to a city council meeting, or try to go hold a sign-up on the street corner.
[03:36:39.857 --> 03:36:42.339]  We all have to exercise that power or lose it.
[03:36:42.924 --> 03:36:43.344]  That's right.
[03:36:43.424 --> 03:36:46.387]  We have to be in the political halls of the nation.
[03:36:46.627 --> 03:36:53.792]  You know, the motto, sort of the unofficial motto of Freedom Force is, don't fight City Hall when you can be City Hall.
[03:36:54.293 --> 03:36:55.514]  And that sums it up.
[03:36:56.054 --> 03:37:05.221]  And I'm happy to say that our members all over the country are gradually getting the idea and they're successfully moving into political groups.
[03:37:05.581 --> 03:37:06.742]  And the system is worried.
[03:37:06.762 --> 03:37:11.766]  They're putting out reports going, there's police, there's military, there's these anti-Federal Reserve people.
[03:37:11.966 --> 03:37:12.706]  They're everywhere!
[03:37:12.726 --> 03:37:13.947]  They might get us!
[03:37:14.368 --> 03:37:14.968]  Oh no!
[03:37:16.569 --> 03:37:28.057]  Well, yeah, they might become mayors of cities, they may become members of city councils, they may become elected to state positions, they may become chiefs of police.
[03:37:28.238 --> 03:37:28.638]  Who knows?
[03:37:28.938 --> 03:37:31.620]  They may actually recapture control of their own system.
[03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:32.741]  That's the whole idea.
[03:37:33.479 --> 03:37:34.520]  Oh, we don't want to do that.
[03:37:35.260 --> 03:37:38.883]  And throw out the evil mayors who are on offshore payrolls publicly.
[03:37:38.903 --> 03:37:45.147]  You know, one thing, not just getting back into government and the system, but also surveilling corrupt politicians legally.
[03:37:45.167 --> 03:37:47.849]  I mean, most of these guys are really corrupt.
[03:37:47.869 --> 03:37:52.292]  You'll catch them with hookers, gambling, stealing, weird stuff.
[03:37:52.892 --> 03:37:56.535]  If you just go out and surveil corrupt people, folks, they're doing evil.
[03:37:57.200 --> 03:38:00.103]  You know, good people are just at home barbecuing and hanging out with the family.
[03:38:00.403 --> 03:38:02.165]  These globalists are all scum.
[03:38:02.786 --> 03:38:03.947]  And they're all degenerates.
[03:38:03.987 --> 03:38:06.730]  You don't do bad things in life unless you're overall bad.
[03:38:07.310 --> 03:38:09.393]  And, you know, I say play hardball with them, too.
[03:38:10.053 --> 03:38:14.257]  Well, yeah, it is partly the nature of the beast of this thing we call government.
[03:38:14.297 --> 03:38:17.481]  We've allowed it to grow and grow and become more powerful.
[03:38:18.201 --> 03:38:26.126]  And whenever you've got a center of power like that, it's a magnet for the criminal class or the predator class.
[03:38:27.007 --> 03:38:33.590]  People who want to take advantage of others just instinctively gravitate to something like that.
[03:38:33.991 --> 03:38:47.539]  So part of our long-range strategy for success and victory that we were talking about is to dismantle that magnet so that it won't attract that criminal class anymore.
[03:38:48.163 --> 03:38:54.485]  Yeah, if there's not a big government, there's no power mass or levers for a psycho or control freak to get control of.
[03:38:54.545 --> 03:39:00.647]  If we build these giant government systems, they're going to be taken over by crooks if they weren't built by them to begin with.
[03:39:00.727 --> 03:39:01.247]  That's right.
[03:39:01.647 --> 03:39:04.228]  So, people haven't thought that all the way through.
[03:39:04.268 --> 03:39:08.489]  They think that the solution to corruption in government is to make government stronger.
[03:39:09.452 --> 03:39:14.237]  More investigations, more laws and so forth, and that's just the opposite of the solution.
[03:39:14.658 --> 03:39:24.849]  That structure should start to be dismantled and all of these tools that they have for controlling the lives of its citizens need to be just eliminated.
[03:39:25.530 --> 03:39:31.635]  And then citizens will automatically start killing snakes in their own backyards and calling the government to do it.
[03:39:32.055 --> 03:39:36.299]  And then citizens will start putting up their own fences and start learning how to defend themselves.
[03:39:36.339 --> 03:39:41.222]  And then the wealth and money and ideas go back into the free market.
[03:39:41.783 --> 03:39:44.705]  Instead of, I look at the general public, they're totally domesticated.
[03:39:45.145 --> 03:39:49.189]  I'm domesticated compared to my dad.
[03:39:49.249 --> 03:39:51.310]  He's domesticated compared to his dad.
[03:39:51.690 --> 03:39:53.432]  I mean, we really are becoming weaklings.
[03:39:54.065 --> 03:40:04.453]  Yeah, well that's been part of the strategy and it's interesting to me because over the years I've had a chance to study some of the more esoteric literature by these people.
[03:40:04.773 --> 03:40:08.796]  You know, the deep thinkers, the scholars on the collectivist side.
[03:40:09.637 --> 03:40:15.341]  You don't run into their names often, but they've written books, they've given speeches and lectures.
[03:40:15.501 --> 03:40:16.702]  Some of them are in academia.
[03:40:17.362 --> 03:40:27.869]  And they wax eloquent about how wonderful it would be to domesticate the human race and breed out of them all of these aggressive instincts, as they say.
[03:40:28.250 --> 03:40:34.754]  And to convert the human animal into a productive and kind and gentle thing.
[03:40:35.294 --> 03:40:41.478]  And of course, they say if they have to kill a few million people along the way to do that, and torture a few, well, that's okay.
[03:40:41.518 --> 03:40:43.200]  The end justifies the means.
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:46.941]  It's pretty amazing how they justify these things.
[03:40:47.061 --> 03:40:53.524]  Well, the truth is, when you really meet these liberal collectivists, and they're not really liberal, but that's what they usually are hiding under that mantle.
[03:40:54.004 --> 03:40:59.706]  It's like, yes, we're going to have to kill a lot, and you see them kind of going, you know, just getting off on it.
[03:40:59.786 --> 03:41:02.527]  And the truth is, they're killer apes in their own view.
[03:41:03.427 --> 03:41:10.810]  They're just high-functioning psychos who act like they're these egalitarians, and really, they're just a bunch of lunatic control freaks that
[03:41:11.986 --> 03:41:15.029]  Yeah, I think they're certainly true.
[03:41:15.049 --> 03:41:16.130]  A lot of them are just like that.
[03:41:16.471 --> 03:41:22.818]  They may look very meek and mild and be wearing bifocals, but there is a killer instinct there, yeah.
[03:41:24.136 --> 03:41:26.397]  And we've got to re-harness our killer instinct for defense.
[03:41:26.417 --> 03:41:27.057]  That's the problem.
[03:41:27.117 --> 03:41:36.300]  I found really intelligent, over-confident, nice, friendly people are gregarious, good-natured, don't want to get involved.
[03:41:36.680 --> 03:41:44.262]  We kind of just sit back and then there's these little, greedy, weak people who want to get in the power and then hate those of us that are strong.
[03:41:44.563 --> 03:41:48.864]  And I found that to be the secret to eugenics is they sell it to the strong
[03:41:49.344 --> 03:41:54.771]  As, oh, we're just going to make the strong and the healthy have more of the world, which is bad enough because it always leads to evil.
[03:41:55.031 --> 03:41:57.394]  But in truth, they're actually targeting the strong.
[03:41:58.769 --> 03:42:06.755]  Well, yeah, they're targeting... Yeah, the strength or the weakness of an individual has nothing to do with their plan, even though they say that it does.
[03:42:06.976 --> 03:42:13.941]  But what their plan is focused on is the ideological orientation of the individual.
[03:42:14.461 --> 03:42:22.087]  Strong or weak, if they support their collectivist agenda, then they are to be defended and preserved.
[03:42:22.448 --> 03:42:27.852]  If they're opposed to the collectivist agenda, then they're alleged to be defective and must be eliminated.
[03:42:28.484 --> 03:42:35.168]  So strength or weakness is measured primarily in terms of the degree to which individuals support their agenda.
[03:42:35.669 --> 03:42:44.815]  But like an animal farm, when the big stallion workhorse breaks his back trying to make more money for the pigs, then they load him up and sell him to the glue factory.
[03:42:45.335 --> 03:42:49.718]  So they also, at the same time, do hate the beautiful, the smart, the intelligent.
[03:42:50.058 --> 03:42:54.001]  Most of these eugenicists are like goblin-like creatures who want to pull everything down.
[03:42:55.029 --> 03:42:57.971]  Yeah, they get to be very analytical about society.
[03:42:58.391 --> 03:43:04.876]  They look at the human being as a machine, something to be controlled and directed, you know.
[03:43:05.536 --> 03:43:10.620]  In fact, my mind just went back to that famous line attributed to the Rothschilds.
[03:43:11.981 --> 03:43:12.842]  I had it in my book.
[03:43:13.202 --> 03:43:24.510]  It said that the rulers of society, and they were referring indirectly to the Rothschilds in this sense, they look at man as a machine and woman as a toy.
[03:43:25.425 --> 03:43:30.148]  I thought, boy, that's quite an egalitarian view of the world, I would say.
[03:43:32.129 --> 03:43:37.331]  But they certainly do look at men as machines, machines to be controlled and put to work.
[03:43:37.511 --> 03:43:39.793]  And if they don't work well, then destroy them.
[03:43:44.113 --> 03:43:49.095]  Well, I want to take a few calls for G. Edward Griffin, Ronny, Rob, Adam, Greg, and Chris, and that'll be it.
[03:43:49.296 --> 03:43:50.436]  We can take those five.
[03:43:50.456 --> 03:43:51.116]  Sorry, the others.
[03:43:51.617 --> 03:43:54.718]  But I wanted just to get your view on the carbon tax.
[03:43:54.758 --> 03:43:56.379]  This is wildly unpopular.
[03:43:56.859 --> 03:43:58.320]  I think it's going to blow up in their face.
[03:43:58.680 --> 03:43:59.961]  Not letting anybody read the bill.
[03:43:59.981 --> 03:44:01.221]  300 pages of it.
[03:44:01.261 --> 03:44:02.042]  Now we've got it.
[03:44:02.602 --> 03:44:04.043]  And they're trying to pass the Senate.
[03:44:04.603 --> 03:44:06.304]  Federal home inspectors and
[03:44:07.851 --> 03:44:10.315]  Selective carbon taxes on who they want?
[03:44:10.335 --> 03:44:14.281]  It's like Obama selectively deciding who can keep their dealerships.
[03:44:14.882 --> 03:44:20.671]  I mean, we're really seeing a takeover and the gas, the honeymoon is running out quick on this guy.
[03:44:21.556 --> 03:44:29.344]  Well, yes, and I certainly agree that people are fed up with all of it, and this just is like another straw on the camel's back.
[03:44:29.704 --> 03:44:34.949]  But I'm not so sure about whether they're going to not be allowed to continue.
[03:44:35.249 --> 03:44:38.533]  Because, you know, these people really don't care what the American people think right now.
[03:44:38.953 --> 03:44:42.076]  They've come to the point where they just sort of go ahead anyway.
[03:44:42.496 --> 03:44:45.860]  I mean, this whole issue of global warming is a perfect example.
[03:44:46.720 --> 03:44:58.809]  I would say that about a year or a year and a half ago, if you were to poll the average citizen out there, the overwhelming majority of them would say, oh yes, we've got global warming, yes, it's something that's very serious and we've got to do something about it.
[03:44:59.190 --> 03:45:07.356]  But now, with all of the scientific evidence that has come out, and all of the obvious fact of global cooling that's been taking place,
[03:45:07.836 --> 03:45:08.356]  And that's the key!
[03:45:08.376 --> 03:45:09.296]  And that's the key!
[03:45:37.554 --> 03:45:40.856]  Well, but that's the key, is that they do just ignore us on every front.
[03:45:41.337 --> 03:45:45.700]  And it's clear, they've made the decision to go ahead and push us into revolution.
[03:45:46.200 --> 03:45:48.742]  That's what their paramilitary NORTHCOM's ready for.
[03:45:49.103 --> 03:45:52.265]  They've told the police, get ready, the vets, the gun owners are going to attack you.
[03:45:53.266 --> 03:45:56.768]  And it's kind of a self-fulfilling process to further destroy the country.
[03:45:57.129 --> 03:46:03.153]  I'm not saying they're going to go with that, but if they can goad us into physical conflict, all the better for them.
[03:46:06.365 --> 03:46:08.427]  It's just another form of problem, reaction, solution.
[03:46:08.467 --> 03:46:09.367]  Your comments on that?
[03:46:09.688 --> 03:46:10.108]  Well, yes.
[03:46:10.208 --> 03:46:16.793]  I think that they have anticipated that long ago, that inevitably it would come to an uprising.
[03:46:17.373 --> 03:46:25.359]  And so they started to prepare for it, and I think they came to the point about maybe a year, a year and a half ago, where they think that the sooner the better.
[03:46:25.559 --> 03:46:26.300]  Let's get on with it.
[03:46:26.760 --> 03:46:28.181]  Let's close the gate.
[03:46:28.201 --> 03:46:30.683]  Let's have a good excuse for bringing about martial law.
[03:46:31.344 --> 03:46:33.245]  Yeah, let's goad people into the streets.
[03:46:33.365 --> 03:46:33.966]  Let's get them
[03:46:34.667 --> 03:46:37.071]  Uh, you know, wild-eyed, full of revolt.
[03:46:37.432 --> 03:46:40.958]  You know, people don't understand the difference between a revolt and a revolution.
[03:46:42.110 --> 03:46:43.711]  Revolts never succeed.
[03:46:44.131 --> 03:46:46.132]  Revolutions sometimes succeed.
[03:46:46.593 --> 03:46:57.598]  And the difference between the two is that revolutions have leadership, they're usually conducted by governmental units within a governmental entity.
[03:46:57.959 --> 03:47:00.440]  They have manifestos, they have creeds, it's an idea.
[03:47:00.460 --> 03:47:04.842]  They have leadership, training, funding, communications, a strategy, they have everything.
[03:47:07.117 --> 03:47:15.161]  You know, just plain revolt is where people throw up their hands and say, I'm sick and tired, I'm not going to put up with it anymore, and they grab their musket and go out in the street.
[03:47:15.541 --> 03:47:17.562]  Well, they're easily mowed down.
[03:47:17.602 --> 03:47:21.144]  I mean, the American Revolution was not a revolt, it was a revolution.
[03:47:21.204 --> 03:47:24.285]  It was fought by the continental government.
[03:47:24.365 --> 03:47:31.108]  The colonies had their militia, they had their training, their leaders, their ammunition, they had strategy, you know, funding, they had all of that.
[03:47:31.448 --> 03:47:34.970]  And they had a code, and they had a manifesto.
[03:47:35.350 --> 03:47:37.411]  Yes, but they had leadership.
[03:47:37.451 --> 03:47:43.755]  Their leaders in the colonial representative governments declared on their behalf and so forth.
[03:47:43.775 --> 03:47:46.957]  You can argue with some of that, but the point is that it was organized.
[03:47:47.137 --> 03:47:48.878]  And that also lended legitimacy.
[03:47:49.118 --> 03:47:55.502]  Yes, today these revolts that people are urging on the American people are just suicidal.
[03:47:55.702 --> 03:47:56.663]  It just makes me sick.
[03:47:57.819 --> 03:48:01.962]  Well, I actually think a revolt is going to chew up a lot of military and police, but the globalists don't care.
[03:48:02.242 --> 03:48:06.905]  That would make the government the victim, and then the real oppression comes in.
[03:48:06.925 --> 03:48:11.368]  And that's why I always see these federal operatives trying to hype it, but they never get in trouble.
[03:48:11.668 --> 03:48:15.091]  Folks, if you're not a federal operative and you call for violence, they come after you.
[03:48:15.471 --> 03:48:20.114]  They only, but they have people out there always calling for violence and saying, why doesn't Alex call for violence?
[03:48:20.134 --> 03:48:20.814]  He's a coward.
[03:48:21.815 --> 03:48:23.016]  Those are feds, folks.
[03:48:23.900 --> 03:48:24.500]  Guaranteed.
[03:48:24.901 --> 03:48:27.582]  They want to prematurely have us launch our revolution.
[03:48:28.082 --> 03:48:36.646]  We need to let the enemy's abuses continue to pile up while we continue to peacefully wake up the people until the government itself, many people in it, don't want to go along with it.
[03:48:36.886 --> 03:48:38.727]  And we're already starting to see that, G. Edward.
[03:48:39.387 --> 03:48:40.308]  I'm glad to hear that.
[03:48:40.768 --> 03:48:43.289]  I was not aware of that, but that's good news.
[03:48:44.500 --> 03:48:45.760]  Oh yeah, let's go ahead and take a call.
[03:48:45.840 --> 03:48:49.481]  Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air with G. Everett Griffin, author of Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:48:49.521 --> 03:48:49.882]  Go ahead.
[03:48:50.342 --> 03:48:51.042]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[03:48:51.082 --> 03:48:56.503]  About a Creature from Jekyll Island, I've just given copies to the new mayor of Livingwell.
[03:48:56.543 --> 03:49:02.425]  He's sharing it with Mike Martinez and my sisters, other friends at the farmer's market and stuff.
[03:49:02.465 --> 03:49:03.405]  Copies of your book.
[03:49:03.946 --> 03:49:05.686]  It's so phenomenal.
[03:49:06.006 --> 03:49:06.726]  Well, thank you.
[03:49:07.046 --> 03:49:07.967]  Thank you.
[03:49:08.007 --> 03:49:08.827]  I'm trying to thank you.
[03:49:08.847 --> 03:49:10.167]  I'm so honored to hear your voice.
[03:49:10.367 --> 03:49:10.807]  You can hear me?
[03:49:11.128 --> 03:49:12.268]  I've yet to get feedback.
[03:49:12.955 --> 03:49:15.276]  I have in effect been banned from the City Council.
[03:49:15.316 --> 03:49:18.717]  I'm sure you have experience with that, Mr. Jones.
[03:49:19.197 --> 03:49:26.359]  OBGYN Dr. Ron Paul, Revolution of Love for Liberty and our Sacred Constitution, through the campaign for liberty.com, just keeps on keeping on.
[03:49:26.379 --> 03:49:28.019]  I had to throw that in there.
[03:49:28.059 --> 03:49:32.701]  But about what you were saying earlier, elitism is at the core of all of this.
[03:49:33.441 --> 03:49:34.661]  Bigotry and elitism.
[03:49:34.701 --> 03:49:40.203]  And so eugenics is fundamentally evil and it's our main, one of our main problems in defeating eugenics.
[03:49:40.976 --> 03:49:45.181]  Is the fact that there is some truth in what they say about human overpopulation.
[03:49:45.221 --> 03:49:49.946]  I mean, the population of humans on earth has more than doubled in my lifetime.
[03:49:50.667 --> 03:49:53.029]  And thus it is a real challenge for survival in the future.
[03:49:53.049 --> 03:50:00.377]  But I also agree with you, Mr. Jones and Mr. Watson, your previous guest, that killing people is not the answer.
[03:50:00.517 --> 03:50:00.938]  Obviously,
[03:50:01.485 --> 03:50:02.246]  There are no guarantees.
[03:50:02.286 --> 03:50:03.166]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:50:03.267 --> 03:50:13.996]  Even if you think we're overpopulated, which actually is disinfo at many levels, some of the technologies are dirty and bad and may have problems and need to be perfected or improved on.
[03:50:14.676 --> 03:50:17.679]  The issue is all this eugenics isn't about population.
[03:50:17.719 --> 03:50:18.900]  It's about control.
[03:50:19.621 --> 03:50:21.162]  It's about restricting.
[03:50:21.222 --> 03:50:22.243]  It's about feudalism.
[03:50:22.303 --> 03:50:23.244]  It's about serfdom.
[03:50:23.284 --> 03:50:26.867]  It's about a top-down, vertically integrated, global government.
[03:50:27.859 --> 03:50:31.502]  And it's about controlling human destiny and dumbing the mass down.
[03:50:31.542 --> 03:50:32.322]  I appreciate your call.
[03:50:33.704 --> 03:50:37.486]  The eugenicists are actually trying to dumb people down to make them more manageable.
[03:50:37.506 --> 03:50:38.127]  Do you ever, Griffin?
[03:50:38.766 --> 03:50:39.206]  Well, yeah.
[03:50:39.346 --> 03:50:40.226]  No question about it.
[03:50:40.266 --> 03:50:43.587]  And I think this issue of overpopulation needs to be focused on.
[03:50:44.287 --> 03:50:49.148]  The evidence is very strong that in advanced societies the population now is decreasing.
[03:50:49.588 --> 03:50:50.269]  Decreasing.
[03:50:50.709 --> 03:50:52.629]  Only in parts of the world is it increasing.
[03:50:52.649 --> 03:50:56.950]  So the answer is you increase the technology, and they all know that.
[03:50:57.530 --> 03:50:59.391]  Jim McGriffin, final segment straight ahead.
[03:50:59.411 --> 03:50:59.871]  Stay with us.
[03:51:02.023 --> 03:51:07.325]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:51:07.826 --> 03:51:14.849]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:51:15.409 --> 03:51:21.572]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:51:21.932 --> 03:51:23.833]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:51:23.973 --> 03:51:26.394]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:51:26.474 --> 03:51:37.437]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:51:38.058 --> 03:51:39.338]  It's not about left or right.
[03:51:39.718 --> 03:51:41.119]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:51:41.579 --> 03:51:47.821]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:51:48.490 --> 03:51:56.259]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:51:56.759 --> 03:51:57.901]  The Obama Deception.
[03:51:58.341 --> 03:51:59.543]  The people strike back!
[03:52:01.303 --> 03:52:08.887]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.
[03:52:09.067 --> 03:52:13.969]  Get prepared and go to here'swhatyoudo.net and buy the $6 book.
[03:52:14.129 --> 03:52:19.672]  He is also trying to help us by running for Congress to stop the thievery and loss of liberties.
[03:52:19.912 --> 03:52:24.498]  Please arm yourself with his guide and go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:52:24.618 --> 03:52:26.620]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:52:26.780 --> 03:52:28.402]  Hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:52:28.623 --> 03:52:30.865]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:52:31.066 --> 03:52:32.587]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[03:52:32.708 --> 03:52:36.993]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[03:52:37.233 --> 03:52:39.576]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman.
[03:52:39.696 --> 03:52:39.876]  Thank you.
[03:53:01.715 --> 03:53:03.477]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[03:53:03.777 --> 03:53:06.479]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[03:53:06.720 --> 03:53:08.661]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[03:53:08.962 --> 03:53:09.722]  Here's the story.
[03:53:09.942 --> 03:53:14.527]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[03:53:14.747 --> 03:53:15.748]  Now here's the bad news.
[03:53:15.988 --> 03:53:19.271]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[03:53:19.411 --> 03:53:19.831]  We're good to go.
[03:53:44.500 --> 03:53:49.403]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[03:53:49.664 --> 03:53:53.586]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[03:53:53.786 --> 03:53:56.548]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[03:54:21.917 --> 03:54:24.539]  Final segment, and I got all these loaded phone lines here.
[03:54:24.579 --> 03:54:25.659]  I want to try to get to everybody.
[03:54:26.120 --> 03:54:28.261]  Rod in Kentucky, you're on the air with G. Edward Griffin.
[03:54:28.301 --> 03:54:28.681]  Go ahead.
[03:54:28.701 --> 03:54:31.002]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[03:54:31.042 --> 03:54:33.524]  Mr. Griffin, I want to say it's a pleasure to talk to you also.
[03:54:33.584 --> 03:54:40.588]  I use your CD, The Creature from Jekyll Island, as one of the intro packs I give people to introduce them to, to let them know what's going on.
[03:54:40.608 --> 03:54:45.551]  The main reason I called today is I just wanted to let you know, Alex, about the soft kill weapons.
[03:54:45.973 --> 03:54:54.055]  Yeah, I think one of the main things you stressed on it this morning is I went to the doctor, had a complete panel run, all blood tests, everything was absolutely perfect.
[03:54:54.355 --> 03:54:56.096]  You know, I don't drink tap water, stuff like that.
[03:54:56.156 --> 03:55:01.277]  However, my testosterone level was 225 nanograms a deciliter.
[03:55:01.297 --> 03:55:04.118]  The average male is supposed to be 5 to 550.
[03:55:04.198 --> 03:55:06.379]  You don't start reaping the health benefits until 6 to 800.
[03:55:07.529 --> 03:55:18.636]  Now then, even if your blood panels and everything are good, if you live from middle age on with low testosterone, you are at greater, much greater risk for heart attack, stroke, and prostate cancer.
[03:55:19.016 --> 03:55:24.359]  Now then, do you think it's possible that they could be doing things already to lower the male testosterone?
[03:55:24.439 --> 03:55:27.181]  Of course, I went immediately on therapy to replace my level.
[03:55:27.221 --> 03:55:27.621]  No, no, no.
[03:55:27.701 --> 03:55:33.785]  Paul Watson, Paul Watson, uh... I mean, the reason people are polite in Texas is
[03:55:34.574 --> 03:55:37.135]  Just 56 years ago, if you were rude to somebody, they'd kill you.
[03:55:37.775 --> 03:55:42.378]  And now, men just aren't as angry, they aren't as focused, or it's a fake type of, you know, masculineness.
[03:55:42.818 --> 03:55:47.120]  But in armed societies or polite societies, our testosterone is lower.
[03:55:47.440 --> 03:55:49.021]  Our sperm counts are way lower.
[03:55:49.841 --> 03:55:55.624]  We are... Paul Watson has an article where they're putting chemicals in the water at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:55:55.644 --> 03:55:56.784]  Let me get a comment from G.E.B.
[03:55:56.804 --> 03:55:57.465]  Griffin on that.
[03:55:57.485 --> 03:56:01.987]  This engineering of the society, there's a lot of evidence to that.
[03:56:02.027 --> 03:56:02.647]  Your take on it.
[03:56:03.147 --> 03:56:08.930]  Well, my take on it is that, like everybody else, it just makes a lot of sense and you can see the evidence of it as you go.
[03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:14.574]  I haven't really checked out the science myself, Alex, like you have or Watson, but it just makes a lot of sense.
[03:56:15.194 --> 03:56:21.457]  And again, once we understand the big picture and what these people are trying to do, then it's almost a
[03:56:22.398 --> 03:56:29.983]  A perfect litmus paper test that you can use to come to a preliminary judgment anyway as to whether something is true or false.
[03:56:30.243 --> 03:56:35.186]  You do have to run it down and, you know, clarify it and check it out yourself.
[03:56:35.486 --> 03:56:41.970]  But you have a pretty good feeling for whether something is true or false when you understand how well it fits in with the overall plan.
[03:56:42.611 --> 03:56:43.391]  Absolutely.
[03:56:43.751 --> 03:56:44.392]  Absolutely.
[03:56:44.452 --> 03:56:45.652]  Let's take another call here.
[03:56:45.672 --> 03:56:47.814]  Let's talk to Chris in Maryland.
[03:56:47.834 --> 03:56:49.034]  You're on the air with Gever Griffin.
[03:56:49.895 --> 03:56:50.916]  Infowars.com.
[03:56:50.976 --> 03:56:51.276]  Go ahead.
[03:56:52.165 --> 03:57:03.532]  Yeah, I had a question for you because I was talking to some fellows about this issue, but I did some reading on one of the websites, a lot like yours, where they had said that
[03:57:04.159 --> 03:57:17.572]  In the United States, down in the state of Alabama, they found a compound with trucks that had markings that looked a lot like they were Russian, and they were supposed to be drilling them to do civil disobedience and anti-riot.
[03:57:17.592 --> 03:57:18.333]  No, no, let me explain.
[03:57:18.353 --> 03:57:21.476]  This is an old urban legend that's been around since the mid-90s.
[03:57:22.077 --> 03:57:23.238]  This is how they debunk us.
[03:57:24.426 --> 03:57:30.149]  The United States government and others and some private companies bought tons of cheap Eastern Bloc surplus.
[03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:33.371]  And I know people in Bastrop, you know, who collect them.
[03:57:33.411 --> 03:57:35.652]  They got a US one, a British one, a Russian one.
[03:57:36.132 --> 03:57:41.055]  And so people show that and say it's a Russian invasion, a bunch of 1970s rotting equipment.
[03:57:41.815 --> 03:57:48.299]  The real invasion is public deals signed to use Canadian, Mexican troops and others to quell civil disturbances.
[03:57:48.339 --> 03:57:50.580]  That's mainstream news, but nobody will ever focus on it.
[03:57:50.860 --> 03:57:52.621]  Toronto Star, Associated Press,
[03:57:54.867 --> 03:57:56.388]  Vigilant Guardian.
[03:57:57.068 --> 03:58:01.410]  The national-level exercise going on now is with troops from 14 governments.
[03:58:01.430 --> 03:58:02.751]  That's Homeland Security's site.
[03:58:03.071 --> 03:58:05.713]  But nobody will get into the real admitted stuff.
[03:58:06.013 --> 03:58:08.774]  Instead, they talk about what they heard or what they saw.
[03:58:08.794 --> 03:58:09.615]  I appreciate your call.
[03:58:09.635 --> 03:58:11.116]  I'm not saying you're a bad caller.
[03:58:11.436 --> 03:58:12.236]  I'm just correcting that.
[03:58:12.296 --> 03:58:13.617]  J. Everett Griffin, your comments on that.
[03:58:13.957 --> 03:58:18.260]  Well, again, I'm stuck with saying what you said, Alex, that's certainly true.
[03:58:18.901 --> 03:58:24.986]  You get a lot of disinformation out there, and unfortunately, people will run with it because it has the grains of truth.
[03:58:25.486 --> 03:58:27.047]  But no, you're absolutely right.
[03:58:27.768 --> 03:58:32.952]  The real threat is not from a bunch of old Russian trucks sitting in a lock for sale someplace.
[03:58:33.292 --> 03:58:39.537]  It's from the existing government and our treaties with other countries, Canada and Mexico in particular.
[03:58:43.692 --> 03:58:45.392]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.193 --> 03:58:48.553]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.594 --> 03:58:56.595]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:56.795 --> 03:59:00.616]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.837 --> 03:59:06.418]  Number two, our new Energy Czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.738 --> 03:59:07.178]  It's true.
[03:59:07.378 --> 03:59:12.321]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:12.721 --> 03:59:18.164]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:19.025 --> 03:59:21.646]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:59:21.906 --> 03:59:25.327]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:25.567 --> 03:59:26.108]  Number 5.
[03:59:26.428 --> 03:59:30.069]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:59:30.269 --> 03:59:35.771]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
