[00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:06.327]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.327 --> 00:00:08.088]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.088 --> 00:00:09.849]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.430]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.331]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:17.174]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:21.236]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:40.642]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:44.003]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:49.824]  It is the 18th day, Wednesday, the 18th day of March 2009.
[00:00:49.824 --> 00:00:52.365]  We'll be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:52.365 --> 00:01:07.568]  I wanted to get Representative Jim Guest of Missouri back on, not because he's introduced legislation to reaffirm the 9th and 10th Amendment of state sovereignty, but because he is aware of the Missouri State Police document issued by the governor, the MIAC report.
[00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:17.110]  Stating that bumper stickers, Ron Paul support, libertarian support, if you're against the North American Union, that you want to basically kill police, and that you're a white supremacist.
[00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.110]  I mean, that's what it says.
[00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:32.713]  In an audio interview with one of the MIAC officers that we talked to, so we've confirmed, we've talked to this individual, but we didn't record it, a reporter did talk to them and record it, and we're going to be playing that audio
[00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:41.685]  Coming up here where they deny that bumper stickers are mentioned when bumper stickers are mentioned repeatedly in the document in the MIAC report.
[00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:44.849]  Also, Lou Dobbs has done a report on MIAC.
[00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:46.030]  Does it matter?
[00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.615]  People are still emailing me telling me I made fake documents and put them up on the website.
[00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:53.536]  Doesn't matter if they give you the state police names, give you their phone numbers.
[00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:54.876]  It'll never matter.
[00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:56.977]  The Marines aren't trying to confiscate your guns.
[00:01:56.977 --> 00:01:59.358]  They're not announcing they're putting cribs on the streets.
[00:01:59.358 --> 00:02:05.400]  Mainstream news isn't announcing a new bank of the world that will issue its own currency that we will all pay taxes to.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.721]  They're not announcing giant blimps to surveil everything we do.
[00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:10.061]  Tracking and tracing everybody.
[00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:25.360]  No, we're covering what's really happening and what's really going on in society.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.044]  We are covering the real news and information.
[00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:38.299]  We are covering the truth here on this radio show and we do every day from 11 a.m.
[00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:38.839]  to 3 p.m.
[00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.943]  and then back on Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:49.191]  and try as they might, the establishment media is having to admit everything that we've talked about in the last 14 years on this show.
[00:02:51.448 --> 00:03:03.051]  I mean, last week, Michael Savage comes out and says, mark my words, Obama is going to stage a false terror attack along the lines of the Reichstag fire set by Hitler to bring in martial law.
[00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:07.752]  I mean, that's how mainstream false flag terror has become.
[00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:10.033]  Self-inflicted wounds, people's awareness of that.
[00:03:11.917 --> 00:03:17.520]  Also, I'm going to be simulcasting for 10 minutes on Judge Napolitano's Freedom Watch show.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.182]  It's also on the web, so we'll be simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv on his radio show with him.
[00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:24.263]  They also simulcast on the web.
[00:03:24.263 --> 00:03:28.686]  And then we've got Professor Peter Del Scott coming on in the last hour today to talk about a host of issues.
[00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:35.633]  But here it is, Lou Dobbs program, speaking out about the MIAC report.
[00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:39.317]  And we broke that here, thanks to state police.
[00:03:39.317 --> 00:03:45.664]  Also, Army investigating how and why troops were sent into Alabama town after murder spree.
[00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:51.764]  It was only a photo in a Reuters caption of the troops on the streets.
[00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.985]  We called up, got the colonel on last week.
[00:03:53.985 --> 00:04:01.969]  Now the Army is investigating a federal crime was committed by this being done, a violation of posse commentatus.
[00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.651]  Also, getting into the whole banking situation, I'm going to cover that after the break.
[00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:14.176]  Analysis, AIG bosses, the bonuses have caused a new cloud over Treasury boss.
[00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:20.777]  Because it turns out, people are now learning that he basically wrote the Banker Bailout Plan.
[00:04:20.777 --> 00:04:22.498]  And that Obama was instrumental in all of it.
[00:04:22.498 --> 00:04:28.564]  The public is now discovering what we told you months ago and what is in the Obama deception.
[00:04:28.564 --> 00:04:33.589]  Another story here, Obama administration, we didn't find out about AIG bonuses until this month.
[00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:36.292]  Oh, even though it was all over the mainstream news for months.
[00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:39.876]  Also, Britain is showing signs of heading towards 1930-style depression, says Bank.
[00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:45.349]  IMF poised to print billions of new super dollars.
[00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:45.709]  U.S.
[00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:49.270]  injecting billions into foreign banks every week.
[00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.771]  At G20, Kremlin to pitch new global currency.
[00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:53.651]  U.S.
[00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:56.412]  kicks Iran war prep into high gear.
[00:04:56.412 --> 00:04:59.313]  It is all coming up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:59.313 --> 00:05:00.873]  Important transmission.
[00:05:00.873 --> 00:05:02.894]  Gardeners, you have the seeds.

[00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:07.521]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:08.663]  We've got to give them a stake.
[00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.401]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:19.884]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.884 --> 00:06:21.864]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:24.325]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:35.230]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.518 --> 00:06:39.179]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:41.039]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:47.942]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:57.785]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.785 --> 00:06:58.966]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.748 --> 00:07:02.110]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.512]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:07:04.512 --> 00:07:08.677]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:07:08.677 --> 00:07:10.739]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:24.848]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:31.211]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:34.813]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:07:34.813 --> 00:07:38.955]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:07:45.452 --> 00:07:49.395]  You can't possibly know or control what government, corporate America, or others will do.
[00:07:49.395 --> 00:07:51.196]  But you can control what you do.
[00:07:51.196 --> 00:07:52.357]  Complete your supply now.
[00:07:52.357 --> 00:07:53.017]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:53.017 --> 00:07:53.097]  800-409-5633.
[00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:53.218]  800-409-5633.
[00:07:53.218 --> 00:07:56.540]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.061]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.594 --> 00:08:26.899]  We are going to open the phones up in this hour and the next.
[00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:29.520]  Toll free number to join us.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.622]  Do you want to chime in?
[00:08:35.024 --> 00:08:42.507]  On the fact that 9.7 trillion has been stolen by foreign banks and they won't tell the public where the money went.
[00:08:42.507 --> 00:08:51.271]  Meanwhile, Barack Obama and his minions are running around saying they knew nothing about the bailout, they're angry about the bailout, they had no idea this was going to bonuses.
[00:08:51.271 --> 00:09:03.816]  When he engineered the bailout, his entire administration on the financial end of the very people that engineered this back in the 90s, Bush of course worked with them closely, it's one unified group.
[00:09:06.365 --> 00:09:09.387]  And then now they're running around saying, we promise.
[00:09:09.387 --> 00:09:15.970]  Chuckie Schumer's all over the news, Senator Schumer, who's calling for a total gun ban for the American people, an absolute tyrant.
[00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.832]  He says, hey, give the money back or we will take it.
[00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:19.592]  $160 million.
[00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:24.091]  Out of 9.7 trillion.
[00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:39.325]  And so they'll have endless debates and endless discussions and probably even hearings and they'll call in these CEOs and people and say, how dare you take 3 million dollars and there won't be any discussion about the shareholders of the private central banks that got 9.7 trillion.
[00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.332]  That is the big issue.
[00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:46.674]  And you won't hear it discussed anywhere.
[00:09:46.674 --> 00:09:51.158]  It'll be there so mad about the $169 million.
[00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.440]  The people are so upset.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.864]  The same bait and switch was done with
[00:09:59.915 --> 00:10:11.805]  Rick Perry saying, I'm a conservative, I'm not going to take the tens of billions of bailout money and the economic stimulus package that was sent to Texas.
[00:10:11.805 --> 00:10:20.613]  I'm going to give $555 million back, which is a very small amount of the money, but it creates the illusion, oh, Perry gave all the bailout money back.
[00:10:20.613 --> 00:10:23.936]  Perry gave all the stimulus package money back.
[00:10:23.936 --> 00:10:25.217]  Just more stunts!
[00:10:26.633 --> 00:10:34.137]  Be like if you caught somebody robbing a bank and they've got a van just full of $100 bills and the police pull up and they say, you know what?
[00:10:34.137 --> 00:10:37.979]  I'm gonna give you $100 back and I'm gonna keep the million.
[00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:39.360]  How does that sound?
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:46.684]  And then the police have a big investigation about the $100 and there's a big newscast about the $100 and what's gonna be done with it.
[00:10:46.684 --> 00:10:47.965]  Will somebody get in trouble for the $100?
[00:10:47.965 --> 00:10:52.947]  And then never a discussion of the million dollars.
[00:10:52.947 --> 00:10:54.168]  And they just run this scam
[00:10:59.153 --> 00:11:09.542]  Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:10.823]  This is how they operate.
[00:11:10.823 --> 00:11:12.205]  This is what they do.
[00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:16.108]  And until the public figures out the tricks, they're going to continue to be enslaved.
[00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:21.073]  We're going to continue to lose more and more liberties and freedoms in this country.
[00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:21.433]  Period.
[00:11:26.448 --> 00:11:34.830]  Nevertheless, the public is beginning to figure out a little bit.
[00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.810]  Analysis.
[00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:42.952]  AIG bosses are going to have to give back the money.
[00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:43.512]  Again, 160 something
[00:11:53.752 --> 00:11:58.736]  But nothing going on with the trillions.
[00:11:58.736 --> 00:12:04.661]  And you try to explain to the public $160 million is not $9.7 trillion.
[00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:06.442]  They just don't understand.
[00:12:06.442 --> 00:12:10.786]  They just know how to drink fluoride and watch football and act tough, and that's why they're slaves.
[00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:19.893]  And they're taking all the rest of us that are aware and awake right over the edge of the cliff with them.
[00:12:19.893 --> 00:12:23.116]  And it's a very, very disgusting, sad thing
[00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:26.800]  To have all of this going on.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.101]  But it's part of the awakening process.
[00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:31.023]  We have to go through pain first.
[00:12:31.023 --> 00:12:37.446]  AIG bosses are in deep, deep trouble.
[00:12:37.446 --> 00:12:41.148]  400 executives and traders at American International Group.
[00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:44.670]  Oh my gosh, they're in deep trouble.
[00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:53.255]  That's kind of like after they did the banker takeover bill, October 3rd of last year, the media then shifted into, should 40-something billion be given to
[00:12:56.932 --> 00:13:04.477]  American automakers, and then that became the big debate about the forty-something billion instead of the trillions being stolen.
[00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:08.820]  They use that as a diversion, as a distraction.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.241]  And the same thing's being done here.
[00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:18.407]  AIG bonuses, new cloud over Treasury boss.
[00:13:18.407 --> 00:13:23.750]  If not distancing itself from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, the White House is placing firmly
[00:13:25.166 --> 00:13:36.135]  On his shoulders, responsibility for how the government handled the $165 million in bonuses paid to about 400 executives and traders at American International Group, Inc.
[00:13:36.135 --> 00:13:48.885]  See, Geithner's a mid-level minion, so they'll burn him, they'll make it look like he caused the problem, maybe they'll make him leave in a few years after a bunch of hearings, and oh, every American will know about
[00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:53.488]  The 165 million, the 169 million, there's different numbers out there.
[00:13:53.488 --> 00:13:56.851]  I know I keep repeating that, it's just seeing this trick played.
[00:13:56.851 --> 00:14:02.755]  And boy, Geithner sure got it, and Obama sure got punished, and oh, Obama's approval rating's plunging more.
[00:14:02.755 --> 00:14:09.440]  Obama, he's running an all-no discussion of the private shareholders of the banks.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:17.627]  Secretary Geithner last week engaged with the CEO of AIG to communicate
[00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:27.170]  What we thought were outrageous and unacceptable bonuses, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Tuesday.
[00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:32.653]  Then he volunteered to answer a question being asked all over Washington.
[00:14:32.653 --> 00:14:37.696]  Did Geithner still enjoy President Barack Obama's confidence given the whopping bonuses
[00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:43.262]  The failed insurance giant paid Friday after receiving taxpayer bailout money.
[00:14:43.262 --> 00:14:46.646]  The president has complete confidence in Geithner, Gibbs said.
[00:14:46.646 --> 00:14:52.973]  Is Obama satisfied with Geithner's information informed him of the impending bonus payments in a timely fashion?
[00:14:52.973 --> 00:14:54.555]  Yes, the president is satisfied.
[00:15:00.031 --> 00:15:03.452]  But then you read this today out from ABC News.
[00:15:03.452 --> 00:15:04.773]  Obama Administration.
[00:15:04.773 --> 00:15:07.774]  We didn't find out about AIG bonuses until this month.
[00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:10.835]  I mean, they just had bonuses a few months ago.
[00:15:10.835 --> 00:15:14.076]  These people are cons... and this is just one of hundreds of companies.
[00:15:14.989 --> 00:15:33.874]  Sources in the Obama Administration Tuesday said, despite previous media reports, administration officials did not know until a couple of weeks ago that the officials of the controversial AIG Financial Product Division were set to receive $165 million in bonuses on March 13th.
[00:15:33.874 --> 00:15:43.796]  It wasn't until Thursday, March 5th, 2009, administration sources told ABC News that officials of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York informed officials of the Treasury Department
[00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:52.051]  of the full extent of the 165 million bonuses pending for the controversial fiscal product subsidiary.
[00:15:52.051 --> 00:16:01.294]  This was three days after the Obama administration had already announced a new commitment from an additional 330 billion for AIG.
[00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.115]  That's 30 billion for AIG.
[00:16:04.115 --> 00:16:07.816]  Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner was alerted, oh he was alerted last
[00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:18.665]  Tuesday, March 10th, he phoned AIG CEO Edward Liddy on Wednesday evening, March 11th, to protest the bonuses, sources told ABC News.
[00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:20.767]  I mean, do any of you believe this?
[00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:31.676]  He put in the executive order a month and a half ago, Obama did, that all the major banks and brokerage firms were exempt from any
[00:16:35.282 --> 00:16:42.957]  Money that they were previously given in the bailout or under that current bailout plan.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.382]  But the American people aren't paying attention.
[00:16:54.382 --> 00:16:59.666]  They know they're being robbed, but they don't know just how egregious or out in the open it is.
[00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:03.229]  I mean, Obama comes out and says, listen, we're not rewarding failure.
[00:17:03.229 --> 00:17:10.375]  This is outrageous what you banks and brokerage firms have done, and we're not going to allow you to have bonuses.
[00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:13.458]  And then you read the executive order, and it's just like this Guantanamo Bay thing.
[00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:16.881]  Well, we might close it in a year, but we're going to open up all these other camps around the world.
[00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:22.388]  And we're still not going to give people any constitutional rights or even Geneva Convention rights.
[00:17:22.388 --> 00:17:29.237]  And we're going to back Bush on all of his court hearings that are going on and the torturer's court proceedings that are going on.
[00:17:29.237 --> 00:17:32.621]  And we're just going to continue the rendition and everything else, the kidnapping.
[00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:36.863]  But it was announced, Obama closes all the camps!
[00:17:36.863 --> 00:17:38.004]  He closed Guantanamo!
[00:17:38.004 --> 00:17:51.856]  And I hear, you know, quote liberals, which are just establishment lapdogs, posing as liberals, all over talk radio, and on the left channel on XM, you know, every day, hey, he closed Guantanamo, what more are you asking for?
[00:17:51.856 --> 00:17:52.897]  Now the thing is still open!
[00:17:53.971 --> 00:18:07.641]  But it's just like for these CEOs and executives, they say in there that, oh, any bailout money previously or any bailout deals that were agreed to last year, which go on in perpetuity, I mean, you read that bailout bill.
[00:18:07.641 --> 00:18:11.303]  Unlimited money, in total secrecy, forever.
[00:18:11.303 --> 00:18:22.351]  So under the unlimited authority, unlimited power, no investigation allowed, can do whatever they want, under that plan, sure, as long as you're signed on to that plan, you can do whatever you want.
[00:18:24.878 --> 00:18:38.683]  That's why the White House went and encouraged, and Obama encouraged when he was a senator, and the whole gaggle of crooks encouraged every company out there, hey, take this money you're getting in on the ground floor of the looting.
[00:18:38.683 --> 00:18:45.685]  You know, us pirates, we take care of each other and the like of other criminals.
[00:18:45.685 --> 00:18:47.546]  So, this is the news I have here in front of me.
[00:18:47.546 --> 00:18:53.388]  You know, I just can't, and I've got a lot more here, I just can't get over
[00:18:54.711 --> 00:19:01.198]  IMF poised to print billions of dollars in global quantitative easing.
[00:19:01.198 --> 00:19:11.950]  London Telegraph headline, and it just says, the International Monetary Fund is poised to embark on what analysts have described as global easing.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:21.246]  By printing billions of dollars worth of a global super currency in an unprecedented new effort to address the economic crisis.
[00:19:21.246 --> 00:19:30.973]  And then I have more mainstream news today, that's the one I telegraphed yesterday, announcing that they're already printing them and issuing them secretly to themselves.
[00:19:30.973 --> 00:19:39.539]  I mean, you know, the bankers just don't now issue fiat currency through their regional Federal Reserve Banks, you know, in the US and around the world.
[00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:41.121]  Now they just print the money
[00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:47.092]  Backed up by taxpayers and give it directly to themselves and say, hey, don't ask where it went.
[00:19:47.092 --> 00:19:49.332]  We got paramilitary SWAT teams.
[00:19:49.332 --> 00:19:51.553]  We got assassination squads ready.
[00:19:51.553 --> 00:19:53.174]  North Com's in control.
[00:19:53.174 --> 00:19:53.734]  Shut up.
[00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:55.254]  We're taking everything you got.
[00:19:55.254 --> 00:19:56.675]  This is a stick up.
[00:19:56.675 --> 00:19:58.816]  So hands up and shut up, lady.
[00:19:58.816 --> 00:19:59.916]  Put the money in the bag.
[00:20:02.449 --> 00:20:04.229]  Life Change Tea sets the standard.
[00:20:04.229 --> 00:20:11.311]  Have you heard on radio all the new teas with funny names, movie stars, celebrities endorsing these products and so on?
[00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:12.931]  Have you checked the results?
[00:20:12.931 --> 00:20:16.312]  Not the pictures of the bikini babes and such, but the results.
[00:20:16.312 --> 00:20:21.653]  Have you checked their pricing and the funky three-month contracts and all that stuff?
[00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:23.073]  Have you checked their results?
[00:20:23.073 --> 00:20:23.913]  Oh, that's right, I said that.
[00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:26.374]  Did you check the ingredients and you checked for caffeine?
[00:20:26.374 --> 00:20:26.894]  Yeah!
[00:20:27.634 --> 00:20:29.635]  Life Change Tea is the real deal.
[00:20:29.635 --> 00:20:34.556]  Not a new yippee-yi-yay tea, but a tea if you drink it daily, it'll change your life.
[00:20:34.556 --> 00:20:35.997]  And it will clean your body.
[00:20:35.997 --> 00:20:37.337]  Our middle name is Results.

[00:21:00.524 --> 00:21:06.726]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:15.315]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.315 --> 00:21:23.481]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.481 --> 00:21:28.245]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.567 --> 00:21:33.789]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:38.152]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.152 --> 00:21:39.232]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.232 --> 00:21:43.734]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:43.734 --> 00:21:48.636]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:51.638]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:51.638 --> 00:21:53.279]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.968 --> 00:22:00.490]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:06.332]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.332 --> 00:22:13.315]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:13.883 --> 00:22:20.470]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.452]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.452 --> 00:22:24.955]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:24.955 --> 00:22:35.907]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:36.531 --> 00:22:38.193]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.193 --> 00:22:40.055]  It's about a one world government.
[00:22:40.055 --> 00:22:46.962]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:46.962 --> 00:22:55.230]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.811]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:56.811 --> 00:22:57.993]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.146 --> 00:23:02.127]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:02.127 --> 00:23:09.089]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:23:09.089 --> 00:23:17.491]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:17.491 --> 00:23:23.213]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:23.393 --> 00:23:25.235]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:25.235 --> 00:23:27.437]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:27.437 --> 00:23:31.962]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:31.962 --> 00:23:34.165]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:34.165 --> 00:23:42.053]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:23:42.073 --> 00:23:42.533]  We're good.
[00:24:09.053 --> 00:24:15.574]  Look at the hate we're breeding
[00:24:38.132 --> 00:24:40.535]  Look at the fear we're feeding.
[00:24:40.535 --> 00:24:44.158]  Look at the lives we're leading.
[00:24:44.158 --> 00:24:47.682]  The way we've always done before.
[00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:19.285]  Inside History!
[00:25:23.047 --> 00:25:25.308]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:25.308 --> 00:25:26.169]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:29.872]  Coming up, conversation with Sergeant Joe Clark of MIAC.
[00:25:29.872 --> 00:25:32.594]  We are not terrorists, he says.
[00:25:32.594 --> 00:25:44.182]  Then he goes on to deny, basically, that he gets into Ron Paul or Bumper Stickers, and they did a YouTube video with this interview and show close-ups of the MIAC federally written report that goes out to all the state police around the nation.
[00:25:44.182 --> 00:25:47.965]  This is just the Missouri version of it, where it does say Bumper Stickers and Ron Paul.
[00:25:53.007 --> 00:25:56.390]  So we're going to be going over that.
[00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:06.739]  But continuing with the financial news, so the Obama administration saying they're not involved with the bailout, they're not involved with the bonuses, and they're grandstanding with a diversion over $165 million, not the $9.7 trillion.
[00:26:06.739 --> 00:26:08.480]  That's the bottom line there.
[00:26:15.885 --> 00:26:26.429]  Billions and billions of dollars a week are being injected into foreign banks by the private Federal Reserve of your tax money, and they're not telling Congress where the money's going and refuse to answer the questions.
[00:26:26.429 --> 00:26:35.993]  And we've played House members and members of the Senate asking those questions of Bernanke, head of the private Federal Reserve, of course Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, and they just won't answer the question.
[00:26:35.993 --> 00:26:41.375]  Meanwhile, the Moscow Times reports at G20, Kremlin to pitch new global currency.
[00:26:43.055 --> 00:26:55.362]  Now the reason this is happening is the European Union and the private central banks in the West that formed the New World Order are setting up their new global currency that will be issued by a private group of banking families.
[00:26:55.362 --> 00:26:56.283]  That's the London Telegraph.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.783]  And Russia and China are saying, no, we need a new global currency that we have a say in.
[00:27:02.783 --> 00:27:10.788]  So they're all at the table debating how they're going to set up their world government, but bottom line, it'll be a new global currency controlled by banks.
[00:27:10.788 --> 00:27:22.875]  The Kremlin published its priorities Monday for an upcoming meeting of the G20, calling for the creation of a super national reserve currency to be used by international institutions as part of a reform of the global financial system.
[00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:25.297]  That means the end of the dollar.
[00:27:25.777 --> 00:27:31.083]  That's all we had left, not manufacturing, not jobs, nothing.
[00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:39.132]  All we really had left, other than sports teams and Hollywood, was the fact that we had the World Reserve fiat currency.
[00:27:39.132 --> 00:27:41.294]  That's now coming to an end very, very soon.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:48.881]  And then all the tens of trillions the bankers print up of our money to buy things won't be worth anything anymore, but they don't care.
[00:27:48.881 --> 00:27:51.482]  They're moving on to a new currency they're creating.
[00:27:51.482 --> 00:28:03.125]  The International Monetary Fund should investigate the possible creation of a new reserve currency, widening the list of reserve currencies, or using its already existing special drawing rights, or SDRs, as a
[00:28:04.245 --> 00:28:10.455]  Super Reserve currency accepted by the whole international community, the Kremlin said in a statement issued on its website.
[00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:18.507]  The SDR is an international reserve asset created by the IMF in 69 to supplement existing official reserves of member countries.
[00:28:19.721 --> 00:28:27.307]  The Kremlin has persistently criticized the dollar's status as the dominant global reserve currency and has lowered its own dollar holdings in the last few years.
[00:28:27.307 --> 00:28:43.661]  Both President Dmitry Medvedev and President Prime Minister Vladimir Putin have repeatedly called for the ruble to be used as a regional reserve currency, although the idea has received little support outside of Russia.
[00:28:44.301 --> 00:28:49.344]  Analysts said the new Kremlin proposal would elicit little excitement among the G20 members.
[00:28:49.344 --> 00:28:57.008]  This is all in the realm of fantasy, said Sergei Promevo, chief strategist at Ray, Mann and Gorb.
[00:28:57.008 --> 00:29:00.670]  There was a situation that resembled what they're talking about.
[00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.632]  It was called a gold standard and it ended very badly.
[00:29:03.632 --> 00:29:05.873]  Alternatives to the dollar are still hard to find, he said.
[00:29:05.873 --> 00:29:11.076]  The Kremlin's call for a common currency is not the first in recent days.
[00:29:11.076 --> 00:29:13.257]  Speaking at a economic conference in
[00:29:14.077 --> 00:29:29.721]  Kazakhstan last week, the president proposed a global currency called the ACMETL, a conflation of the world's ACME and capital.
[00:29:29.721 --> 00:29:35.122]  Alright, when we come back, I'm going to get into what they're actually setting up, and then your phone calls and a lot more.
[00:29:38.956 --> 00:29:49.220]  We're going to get more to the MIAC report next hour and we'll be simulcasting some with Judge Napolitano as well in the hour after that.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.240]  And we've got Peter Del Scott coming on.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.641]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.641 --> 00:29:55.182]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.182 --> 00:29:57.843]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.078 --> 00:30:04.181]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:09.706]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:30:09.706 --> 00:30:15.432]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:15.432 --> 00:30:16.893]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:16.893 --> 00:30:25.802]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:30:25.862 --> 00:30:26.202]  Yes.

[00:31:01.619 --> 00:31:07.661]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:08.762]  We've got to give them a stake.
[00:31:09.275 --> 00:31:13.516]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.516 --> 00:31:20.017]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.017 --> 00:31:21.997]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.997 --> 00:31:24.438]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.438 --> 00:31:35.300]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.626 --> 00:31:39.308]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.308 --> 00:31:41.170]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:48.077]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:48.077 --> 00:31:56.345]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.345 --> 00:31:57.926]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.926 --> 00:31:59.128]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.703 --> 00:32:04.185]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:04.185 --> 00:32:07.968]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:07.968 --> 00:32:14.272]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:32:14.272 --> 00:32:18.895]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:24.919]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:32:24.919 --> 00:32:27.921]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:32:30.623 --> 00:32:31.023]  I think so.
[00:33:01.309 --> 00:33:06.832]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:23.595 --> 00:33:41.686]  Alright, we're going to go to your calls right now, then I'm going to play a conversation with Sergeant Joe Clark of MIAC out of Missouri, saying things that aren't true, saying there's nothing about bumper stickers on your car with Ron Paul, or bumper stickers period, in the report.
[00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:43.206]  You can go read the report, it's right there.
[00:33:43.206 --> 00:33:47.549]  But it doesn't matter, the public's still in denial about it anyway, so.
[00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:52.452]  They're still in denial about a North American Union, or that there's even an international banking cartel known as the New World Order.
[00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:56.992]  And that is why you're going to be hurt very, very bad.
[00:33:56.992 --> 00:33:57.392]  U.S.
[00:33:57.392 --> 00:33:59.794]  kicks Iran war prep into high gear.
[00:33:59.794 --> 00:34:06.619]  This on the heels of Benjamin Netanyahu, the newly elected Israeli Prime Minister for the second time.
[00:34:08.772 --> 00:34:13.375]  Now back in office saying that they are preparing for a huge war with Iran.
[00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:14.836]  Just days after the top U.S.
[00:34:14.836 --> 00:34:17.958]  commander sketched out plans to strike at Iran, the U.S.
[00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:21.761]  military claims Tehran sent a drone into Iraq in February.
[00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:22.041]  The U.S.
[00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:30.407]  military on Monday claimed that American jets had shot down an Iranian unmanned surveillance aircraft 97 kilometers northeast of Baghdad in February.
[00:34:34.275 --> 00:34:43.359]  Ababil 3 was tracked for 70 minutes before it was shot down well inside Iraqi airspace, reads a statement from the Army.
[00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:54.384]  Even if that's true, they admit that for six years, Wahhabis, that's Al Qaeda backed groups, including the number three men in Al Qaeda, have been attacking Iran inside, backed up by the United States.
[00:34:54.384 --> 00:34:56.345]  And that's, the White House admits that.
[00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:59.127]  That's right, Al Qaeda works for the White House.
[00:34:59.127 --> 00:35:00.947]  I'm sorry that sounds crazy, that's just a fact.
[00:35:03.939 --> 00:35:08.140]  The statement also suggests the aircraft's presence over Iraq was not an accident.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:08.740]  U.S.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:16.761]  claims comes just two days after Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke of the next possible U.S.
[00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:17.521]  target, Iran.
[00:35:17.521 --> 00:35:27.183]  What I worry about in terms of an attack on Iran is in addition to the immediate effect, the effect of the attack is the unintended consequences, Mullen said.
[00:35:27.183 --> 00:35:31.964]  We've got a very strong strategic reserve in our Air Force and our Navy and in that fact
[00:35:32.984 --> 00:35:44.768]  In that part of the world is a maritime part of the world, where the emphasis would certainly be on those two forces, he told Charlie Rose, on the CFR Bilderberg Group TV show.
[00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:48.869]  Charlie Rose is like their official spokesman, that's where they go on to make their world government announcements.
[00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:59.672]  Iran on Tuesday said it has no information on the alleged drone, which has been described as a surveillance and intelligence gathering plane with a maximum range of about 150 kilometers.
[00:35:59.672 --> 00:36:01.433]  Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassin
[00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:09.996]  Khashoggi told reporters in Tehran that the ministry was unaware of the incident mentioned in the vague report issued by the U.S.
[00:36:09.996 --> 00:36:10.716]  military.
[00:36:10.716 --> 00:36:25.369]  Now, remember that many, many times, I mean, it's gotta be more than 20 times we've heard this, that Iran is giving arms to Shiites in Iraq, in the south and in the east.
[00:36:25.369 --> 00:36:26.830]  And it always turns out it's not true.
[00:36:29.164 --> 00:36:33.805]  And remember, this is the same crowd that claimed Iraq had WMDs and was about to attack the U.S.
[00:36:33.805 --> 00:36:36.126]  and had nukes and all the rest of it and lied about it.
[00:36:36.126 --> 00:36:39.047]  They weren't wrong, they lied about it.
[00:36:39.047 --> 00:36:44.108]  This is the same crowd that claimed that Iranian PT boats pulled up beside U.S.
[00:36:44.108 --> 00:36:52.250]  destroyers and said, we're going to kill you, we're going to bomb you, we're firing in 30 seconds.
[00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:55.931]  And I went on air and I said, listen to the recording.
[00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:58.372]  I mean, it's clearly a Westerner even faking a voice.
[00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:02.782]  Yes, I'm going to get you now, going to blow you up!
[00:37:02.782 --> 00:37:07.106]  Then later they admitted, oh, it was some prank on a ham radio.
[00:37:07.106 --> 00:37:21.938]  And then it came out, MSNBC, New Yorker Magazine, that Dick Cheney wanted to stage, in that very area, in a shred of hormuz, fake, blue, U.S.
[00:37:21.938 --> 00:37:26.742]  manufactured, fake Iranian PT boats with Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians,
[00:37:29.409 --> 00:37:33.031]  On board attacking large U.S.
[00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:36.933]  surface vessels.
[00:37:36.933 --> 00:37:38.174]  Okay?
[00:37:38.174 --> 00:37:40.515]  So, remember the crowd we're dealing with.
[00:37:40.515 --> 00:37:49.100]  And then Fox Fallon, the head of CENTCOM at the time, out there on the aircraft carrier said, that's it, I resign.
[00:37:51.034 --> 00:38:02.140]  And it came out that he was upset about the staged terror plan, but also the plan which they executed to order the entire fleet within range of Iranian sunburn missiles.
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:14.307]  They have more than 11,000 sunburn missiles, even with the different Gatling gun systems they have to shoot down missiles, surface-to-air anti-missile guns.
[00:38:16.863 --> 00:38:26.307]  The Naval War College and others and Top Brass predicted that every ship would be heavily damaged and some would be lost.
[00:38:26.307 --> 00:38:43.635]  I mean, can you imagine 11,000 plus French and Russian made, they don't just have sunburns, silkworms, the list goes on and on, being launched at one time at the vessels.
[00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:50.315]  Their range is only about 150 miles.
[00:38:50.315 --> 00:38:52.517]  So, what did the Bush administration do?
[00:38:52.517 --> 00:38:55.800]  They had the aircraft carriers moved in to within 50 miles.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.822]  Close in range.
[00:38:57.822 --> 00:39:02.086]  You know, even if you're going to be 100 miles out, that gives you more time to track the missiles to prepare a response to them.
[00:39:03.336 --> 00:39:03.736]  We're good to go.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:36.949]  They reportedly have more than a dozen of those flying around out there in the Gulf, and they can sit there at a distance zapping missiles.
[00:39:36.949 --> 00:39:38.030]  Oh, but no!
[00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:48.960]  We have to move the ships right up against Iranian territory, also so there can be all that shipping and all those Iranian patrol boats, and so they can, you know, try to get some event going.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.803]  We had a lot of former top CIA analysts on, like Ray McGovern and others,
[00:39:53.464 --> 00:40:02.009]  And they said their number one fear, this is a year before it broke in the news, that they'd heard word they were planning to stage some type of Gulf of Tonkin event right there in the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:40:02.009 --> 00:40:03.310]  So, it's on record.
[00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:11.995]  I know some of you think it's patriotic to attack our own ships, and that's what you gotta do to win the war, boy, gotta get the war started.
[00:40:11.995 --> 00:40:15.877]  But then I might as well let the foreign bankers steal all the money.
[00:40:15.877 --> 00:40:18.139]  See, these aren't patriots that run our country.
[00:40:19.753 --> 00:40:26.317]  And Fox Fallon is certainly no angel, but he was not a complete psychopathic loon.
[00:40:26.317 --> 00:40:27.358]  Didn't want World War III.
[00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:29.519]  I said I'd go to your calls, I'm already digressing.
[00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:33.341]  It's just, you go over all this news, it's just all amazing.
[00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:36.383]  Healthcare overhaul may cost about $1.5 trillion.
[00:40:36.383 --> 00:40:38.384]  Eh, I got a $1 trillion, $100 billion defense budget record.
[00:40:42.948 --> 00:40:46.733]  Uh, you know, just tens of trillions being spent on the bailout.
[00:40:46.733 --> 00:40:51.899]  A $787 million stimulus package.
[00:40:51.899 --> 00:40:54.121]  They're expanding the size of the government everywhere.
[00:40:54.121 --> 00:40:56.805]  Government hiring has expanded.
[00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:10.056]  And they're just raising all these new taxes and state taxes and local taxes and they're going to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze so they can social engineer us.
[00:41:10.056 --> 00:41:20.061]  And now they want a quote, overhaul, that means the federal takeover, guaranteeing health insurance for all Americans may cost about 1.5 trillion, the AP reports.
[00:41:20.061 --> 00:41:27.385]  Health experts say that's more than double the 634 billion down payment President Barack Obama set aside for health reform in his budget.
[00:41:30.728 --> 00:41:39.854]  Administration officials have pointedly avoided providing a ballpark estimate saying it depends on details to be worked out with Congress.
[00:41:39.854 --> 00:41:47.839]  It's impossible to put a price tag on the plan before even the basics have been finalized, said White House spokesman Reed Sherrilyn.
[00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:49.620]  And they go on from there, so enjoy that.
[00:41:50.831 --> 00:41:51.131]  U.S.
[00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:54.253]  consumer prices rise 0.4 percent.
[00:41:54.253 --> 00:41:56.654]  That's a record in recent years.
[00:41:56.654 --> 00:41:58.034]  That's the government's cook numbers, U.S.
[00:41:58.034 --> 00:42:00.535]  consumer prices, so the inflation's coming back in.
[00:42:00.535 --> 00:42:00.795]  U.S.
[00:42:00.795 --> 00:42:09.199]  consumer prices rose in February by the largest amount in seven months as gasoline prices surged again and clothing costs jumped the most in nearly two decades.
[00:42:11.067 --> 00:42:15.348]  Australian government adds wiki links to banned website list.
[00:42:15.348 --> 00:42:22.029]  Linking to flag sites will cost you $11,000 a day and jail time.
[00:42:22.029 --> 00:42:24.870]  This is out of techradar.com.
[00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:31.932]  For those that don't know, the major papers and TV have announced Australia, we're going to have Chinese style net censorship.
[00:42:31.932 --> 00:42:34.252]  There'll be a few thousand sites you can visit.
[00:42:34.252 --> 00:42:36.393]  No alternative political sites, nothing.
[00:42:36.393 --> 00:42:37.853]  Of course, porn will be allowed, of course.
[00:42:38.873 --> 00:43:05.933]  But nothing political, nothing that questions anything that's going on, and they're saying that the government's putting out a list of banned sites that even if you can get around them and put links to them, that it's up to you as an indentured servant to go look at the list of banned things by Fiat, they just announced it, and that if you do link, it says here in the article, to anti-abortion sites, to anti-war sites,
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.221]  Anything.
[00:43:08.221 --> 00:43:15.204]  It's over $11,000 a day fines.
[00:43:15.204 --> 00:43:16.604]  They don't do that in China, folks.
[00:43:16.604 --> 00:43:17.905]  It's not that hardcore.
[00:43:17.905 --> 00:43:25.248]  The Australian Communications Regulator has issued a start warning that websites who link out to banned hyperlinks are liable to be fined up
[00:43:26.277 --> 00:43:29.520]  to eleven thousand Aussie dollars a day.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:37.787]  The news comes after web forum Whirlpool was threatened with the fine for posting a hyperlink to a blacklisted anti-abortion website.
[00:43:37.787 --> 00:43:40.490]  Where are all the liberals talking out against the McCarthyism?
[00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.950]  Oh, they love it.
[00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:47.143]  One of the newest additions to Australia's blacklisted hyperlinks list is Wikileaks.
[00:43:47.143 --> 00:43:52.705]  The website that publishes anonymous submissions of sensitive info on everything from corporations, religion and governments.
[00:43:52.705 --> 00:44:02.529]  And Wikileaks released a few weeks ago, and it's been confirmed now mainstream news, there's a secret treaty being signed to ban all peer-to-peer transmissions of any internet data.
[00:44:02.529 --> 00:44:08.812]  So they're killing the web now, and the public will deny it until it actually happens and say, well I've still got a few thousand sites I can go to.
[00:44:12.782 --> 00:44:22.406]  One of the newest additions is Australia's blacklisted hyperlinks is the WikiLeaks, the website that publishes anonymous submissions of sensitive info on everything from corporations, religion, and governments.
[00:44:22.406 --> 00:44:24.107]  There's one way to handle this.
[00:44:24.107 --> 00:44:26.608]  Do not follow their orders of I was you.
[00:44:26.608 --> 00:44:32.970]  Just everybody, you know, in mass protest, link to the banned sites.
[00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.111]  Get aggressive, folks.
[00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:39.193]  They've already taken your guns, they're stealing your property, they're CPSing your kids in record levels over there.
[00:44:39.193 --> 00:44:39.853]  Stop it!
[00:44:39.853 --> 00:44:41.033]  Stop submitting!
[00:44:41.033 --> 00:44:41.994]  Break out of the spell!
[00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:54.231]  The blacklisting of certain pages on the site has come after Wikileaks posted a list of websites at the tail of 2008 that comprised the secret internet censorship list for Denmark.
[00:44:54.231 --> 00:44:58.156]  On this list were 3,500 sites that were censored or banned in that country.
[00:44:59.013 --> 00:45:02.077]  Including Infowars.com, but people still get around it.
[00:45:02.077 --> 00:45:09.225]  That's right, we're banned on all European transit train wireless systems and British wireless systems.
[00:45:09.225 --> 00:45:10.227]  That's been confirmed.
[00:45:10.227 --> 00:45:12.029]  I mean, you know, this is the freedom, folks.
[00:45:12.029 --> 00:45:15.974]  They don't want me putting all the articles together, Newsweek, Reuters.
[00:45:16.574 --> 00:45:25.496]  London Telegraph, where they say, world banking government's gonna save you, world banking government's good, because then I can post the proof they're doing it, and say, no, I don't think it's good.
[00:45:25.496 --> 00:45:30.978]  How dare I, how dare your phone calls be heard on this radio show as it explodes worldwide?
[00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:35.599]  See, they're getting scared, folks, because we're getting calls and listeners all over the planet.
[00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:38.131]  Disturbing picture.
[00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:52.720]  While Australia's list of blacklisted sites currently stands at 1,370, the Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that the list could increase to around 10,000 sites, most of which are illegal pornographic content, but could also include sites that house incendiary political discussions.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.961]  Yeah.
[00:45:53.961 --> 00:45:59.624]  The government is embarking on a deeply unpopular and troubling experiment to fine-tune its ability to censor the internet.
[00:45:59.624 --> 00:46:01.986]  They say, don't worry, we're just testing it!
[00:46:01.986 --> 00:46:06.169]  Said communications spokesman Senator Scott Ludlam of Australia's
[00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.591]  Opposition Party Greens.
[00:46:08.591 --> 00:46:13.935]  If you consider this kind of net censorship in the context of Australian anti-terror laws, it paints a disturbing picture indeed.
[00:46:13.935 --> 00:46:24.062]  On the website Wikileaks, which leaked the news that the government had banned it for leaking information, simply said, the first rule of censorship is that you cannot talk about censorship.
[00:46:24.062 --> 00:46:26.784]  The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club.
[00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:27.525]  It just goes on and on.
[00:46:27.525 --> 00:46:28.445]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:46:28.445 --> 00:46:29.446]  Let's go to them right now.
[00:46:29.446 --> 00:46:31.768]  I've got stacks of such news in front of me.
[00:46:34.195 --> 00:46:41.360]  Canada's already restricting, with Comcast and some of the other big companies, people down to a few thousand sites.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.281]  We're already being banned everywhere.
[00:46:43.281 --> 00:46:48.445]  I mean, we're just being banned libraries, government buildings, corporations, wireless systems.
[00:46:48.445 --> 00:46:51.707]  The government says, oh, we're taking your tax money and putting it out for free.
[00:46:51.707 --> 00:46:53.108]  You paid for it.
[00:46:53.108 --> 00:46:57.491]  And so you better enjoy InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, ObamaDeception.
[00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.791]  .net, ArnoldExposed.com, JonesReport.com.
[00:47:01.791 --> 00:47:05.072]  That's why we have a lot of websites, was building towards this time.
[00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:24.777]  And there'll come a time where we've got to launch new sites every week, move all the content of InfoWars over to it, just to stay one step ahead and have notices up of this is where you get it now, this is where you get it now, knowing that the bureaucrats will take a few weeks to find it, but now they admit they have computer programs to track where we move, what we do.
[00:47:24.777 --> 00:47:26.998]  They don't want you getting this information.
[00:47:28.396 --> 00:47:30.497]  Okay, they're already restricting videos on the web.
[00:47:30.497 --> 00:47:36.979]  You better get it out now, or we're not going to be able to expose these terrorists.
[00:47:36.979 --> 00:47:39.260]  Okay, who's up first here?
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.781]  John, Joe?
[00:47:41.781 --> 00:47:44.382]  Joe and P.A., thanks for holding.
[00:47:44.382 --> 00:47:45.602]  Good morning, Mr. Jones.
[00:47:45.602 --> 00:47:46.323]  How are you?
[00:47:46.323 --> 00:47:48.423]  Good, sir.
[00:47:48.423 --> 00:47:57.667]  I just want to let you know that on the eve that you released the Obama deception, I renewed my membership, downloaded and started burning, and I gave
[00:47:58.892 --> 00:48:04.833]  About 15 videos to somebody and it's now on our public access over here.
[00:48:04.833 --> 00:48:06.974]  Small little town on the East Coast.
[00:48:06.974 --> 00:48:09.394]  Yeah, they can't allow this explosive distribution.
[00:48:09.394 --> 00:48:12.475]  You know, I'll make a film that cost me $100,000 to make.
[00:48:12.475 --> 00:48:15.015]  I release it for free.
[00:48:15.015 --> 00:48:21.257]  I release it for free, but to folks with a high quality, prisonplanet.tv and now it is the number one video all over the web.
[00:48:21.257 --> 00:48:22.097]  Thanks to people like you.
[00:48:22.097 --> 00:48:22.877]  Go ahead.
[00:48:22.877 --> 00:48:26.118]  Well, it's going, it's going viral over here in our little town.
[00:48:27.657 --> 00:48:30.178]  But anyway, I wanted to let you know that.
[00:48:30.178 --> 00:48:36.261]  And I was watching the Fox News last night, and I was almost going crazy.
[00:48:36.261 --> 00:48:46.306]  These people are talking about the cows starving out in the middle of nowhere, and they've got to burn cactuses to feed them.
[00:48:46.306 --> 00:48:55.750]  And my dad's watching TV with me, and all of a sudden it's like, they've got money to bail out banks, they've got money to bail out car people,
[00:48:56.212 --> 00:48:58.013]  But they're not helping the farmers.
[00:48:58.013 --> 00:49:02.896]  And I said, you know, if the people are starving, who's going to get the loans and buy cars?
[00:49:02.896 --> 00:49:06.098]  And anybody, you know, you've got to put the dots together.
[00:49:06.098 --> 00:49:09.179]  That's right, you've got to feed the coyotes, and I saw that.
[00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:12.161]  You've got to feed the coyotes, but let Americans go homeless.
[00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:17.584]  And Obama has announced two weeks ago, CNN, AP, Reuters, it's unbelievable.
[00:49:17.584 --> 00:49:20.105]  When we first posted it last week, people couldn't believe it.
[00:49:20.105 --> 00:49:24.168]  They are announcing that they're not going to give health care to the troops, and they'll have to get their own insurance.
[00:49:25.345 --> 00:49:28.468]  I had a thought about that, Mr. Jones, and that is
[00:49:43.886 --> 00:49:49.029]  I think that the powers that be are trying to incite the people to violence.
[00:49:49.029 --> 00:49:50.230]  I agree.
[00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:51.091]  I agree.
[00:49:51.091 --> 00:49:54.393]  So that they can round us all up and put us away.
[00:49:54.393 --> 00:50:00.797]  Why do you think they keep introducing the idea of rioting and even acting like it's a good thing on the news?
[00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:08.902]  They want rioting, they want dead cops and military, and then society will break down, then they'll bring in more troops behind them.
[00:50:08.902 --> 00:50:10.903]  They want it, and they want it bad.
[00:50:11.283 --> 00:50:17.888]  And I want, I think the listeners, the ones that are the militias that listen to this show, should cooler heads prevail.
[00:50:17.888 --> 00:50:20.350]  It's got to be done by stealth, get it coordinated.
[00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:24.153]  If they're going to do something, make sure it's coordinated and fast.
[00:50:24.153 --> 00:50:28.076]  Well, what's going to happen is, they're going to push people into corners.
[00:50:29.082 --> 00:50:33.888]  With gun confiscation, you know, and riotings going on, food confiscation.
[00:50:33.888 --> 00:50:40.416]  And so when people just fight back because they don't want to see their kid pulled away from them and put on an army truck, you'll be called a terrorist.
[00:50:40.416 --> 00:50:46.143]  If you don't want to be injected with a deadly smallpox or anthrax or bird flu shot, you'll be a terrorist.
[00:50:46.724 --> 00:50:53.331]  And then they want to have society break down, have it set the precedent for that, and then move into real martial law.
[00:50:53.331 --> 00:50:53.752]  I hear you.
[00:50:53.752 --> 00:50:54.573]  Great call.
[00:50:54.573 --> 00:50:55.594]  We're a call straight ahead.
[00:50:55.594 --> 00:50:58.877]  Yes, air The Obama Deception on AXS television everywhere.
[00:50:58.877 --> 00:50:59.899]  You have my permission.
[00:51:01.067 --> 00:51:04.590]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:06.492]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:51:06.492 --> 00:51:12.056]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:51:12.056 --> 00:51:20.103]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[00:51:57.677 --> 00:52:01.479]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[00:52:01.479 --> 00:52:07.323]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.323 --> 00:52:14.308]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.873 --> 00:52:21.457]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.457 --> 00:52:23.439]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.439 --> 00:52:25.941]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.941 --> 00:52:36.908]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.503 --> 00:52:39.164]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.164 --> 00:52:41.024]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:47.947]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:52:56.191 --> 00:52:57.771]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.771 --> 00:53:02.253]  The people strike back.
[00:53:02.253 --> 00:53:04.874]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[00:53:05.413 --> 00:53:08.314]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[00:53:08.314 --> 00:53:12.596]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[00:53:12.596 --> 00:53:17.978]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[00:53:17.978 --> 00:53:25.821]  GetSeeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with a complete range of crops.

[00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:24.718]  Look, people get hurt, things get broken during empire building.
[00:54:24.718 --> 00:54:27.300]  They're breaking a few eggs to make an omelette.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.502]  They haven't even gotten started bankrupting this country.
[00:54:30.502 --> 00:54:36.006]  They built their police state up so they can suppress the people and carry out the crime, and they're gonna do it.
[00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:36.666]  But the people,
[00:54:39.744 --> 00:54:40.124]  Hey Alex?
[00:54:40.124 --> 00:54:41.485]  I'll make this real quick, sweet and short.
[00:54:41.485 --> 00:54:44.485]  I appreciate you educating me and everything.
[00:54:44.485 --> 00:54:47.406]  And I wanted to report to you here in Ft.
[00:54:47.406 --> 00:54:48.227]  Waterford.
[00:55:09.366 --> 00:55:12.668]  Working in an old field so I'm around all over.
[00:55:12.668 --> 00:55:19.853]  I see a bunch of black aircraft coming into the Naval Joint Reserve Base up here at Cardwell.
[00:55:19.853 --> 00:55:23.675]  No numbers, no identification, no nothing.
[00:55:23.675 --> 00:55:27.697]  There's probably three to five a day, has been for the past three weeks.
[00:55:27.697 --> 00:55:30.119]  We'll let you know that, maybe do your homework on that.
[00:55:30.119 --> 00:55:34.502]  Probably flying heroin and cocaine in, I mean they crash all the time.
[00:55:34.502 --> 00:55:36.503]  Probably flying drugs in for our children.
[00:55:37.648 --> 00:55:54.391]  I also wanted to ask you if you could somehow inform us on how to, uh, what's the word I'm looking for here, try to get into our Texas legislature to get the crap out.
[00:55:54.391 --> 00:56:01.713]  If you understand what I mean by crap, get Perry and all these other pricks that are doing no good for nobody and nothing and helping support
[00:56:03.781 --> 00:56:24.240]  Well Perry Perry would have lost the election but they did that big four-way race so he could win you know he won with a minority what was it like 39% of the vote and it's just a criminal elite and education is the way to go I mean the Texas legislature breaks state law every time they vote they allow
[00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:29.605]  Uh, the representatives to vote for each other, and they do it right there on camera, not even caring.
[00:56:29.605 --> 00:56:32.247]  That's how corrupt the culture is.
[00:56:32.247 --> 00:56:34.068]  We're just like Mexico or North Korea.
[00:56:34.068 --> 00:56:42.375]  We are collapsing because the criminals are just snatching and grabbing all the money for themselves, and they don't care, and most of the elites are moving out of the country.
[00:56:42.375 --> 00:56:50.442]  They know they've stolen us so blind, they're just gonna let us collapse and then be a third world cesspit with paramilitary police running all over us, just like Mexico.
[00:56:52.031 --> 00:56:56.793]  Well, I guess what I was getting at is if you could, you know, I'm trying, I'm passing your word.
[00:56:56.793 --> 00:56:58.173]  I'd like to get more involved.
[00:56:58.173 --> 00:57:00.174]  I'd like to get the bad out.
[00:57:00.174 --> 00:57:04.236]  And, you know, hell, just receive from the United States.
[00:57:04.236 --> 00:57:05.096]  They should be fine.
[00:57:05.096 --> 00:57:06.617]  I don't care if we're big enough.
[00:57:06.617 --> 00:57:07.257]  I know how to hunt.
[00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.298]  I know how to fish.
[00:57:08.298 --> 00:57:12.399]  But we've got to start small, you know, catch the little fish before we can move up to Obama.
[00:57:12.399 --> 00:57:15.500]  I'd like to get them all with a big net, but that's not possible.
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:21.043]  So I want to further myself into trying to get rid of, you know, like Perry and this crap.
[00:57:22.361 --> 00:57:26.364]  It's just the bad people that are not doing us any favors.
[00:57:39.802 --> 00:58:03.640]  Um, we are trying to educate the public, we're trying to get them to realize what's happening, but for decades they were told there's no globalism, there's no corruption, government's only good, there's no bad elites, and so the bankers are robbing us blind in front of everybody, and I'm just here trying to educate the public on how serious the level of thieving and stealing and just outright corruption is.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.542]  See, as corruption accelerates, it just gets worse and worse.
[00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:09.123]  And of course, that's obvious.
[00:58:09.123 --> 00:58:10.585]  As it accelerates, it gets worse and worse.
[00:58:10.585 --> 00:58:12.928]  But I mean, it literally does.
[00:58:12.928 --> 00:58:15.772]  And then the criminals get more and more bold.
[00:58:15.772 --> 00:58:20.377]  And as they commit more and more crimes and don't get in trouble for it, they just commit bigger and bigger crimes.
[00:58:20.377 --> 00:58:24.482]  And so crime becomes goodness, and goodness becomes a crime.
[00:58:25.455 --> 00:58:26.035]  You understand?
[00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:27.997]  Being good is a crime.
[00:58:27.997 --> 00:58:29.658]  Being an American is a crime.
[00:58:29.658 --> 00:58:30.999]  Being honest is a crime.
[00:58:30.999 --> 00:58:34.922]  Being a scumbag piece of filth, they like you because, you know, you're like them.
[00:58:34.922 --> 00:58:35.762]  They can trust you.
[00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:38.584]  We'll be right back with the second hour of Warrior Call.
[00:58:38.584 --> 00:58:43.087]  Stay with us.
[00:58:43.087 --> 00:58:45.569]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.569 --> 00:58:47.891]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.742 --> 00:58:52.423]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.423 --> 00:58:57.166]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.166 --> 00:59:00.127]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.127 --> 00:59:03.169]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.169 --> 00:59:07.892]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.112 --> 00:59:09.254]  If you simply prepare.

[00:59:56.005 --> 01:00:05.468]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.768]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.768 --> 01:00:08.549]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:10.289]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.289 --> 01:00:11.890]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:12.830]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:17.612 --> 01:00:21.673]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.612 --> 01:00:29.186]  We have Representative Jim Gess coming up in about 7 minutes.
[01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:33.269]  Let's be with us for a segment or two.
[01:00:33.269 --> 01:00:39.112]  I want to get into the MIAC state police report written by the feds of Missouri.
[01:00:39.112 --> 01:00:43.594]  We also have an interview with one of the state police on this subject recorded.
[01:00:43.594 --> 01:00:44.415]  Yes, it's real.
[01:00:44.415 --> 01:00:45.215]  It's really happening.
[01:00:45.215 --> 01:00:45.956]  It's really going on.
[01:00:45.956 --> 01:00:56.041]  It's gotten a lot of attention as they demonize libertarians, gun owners, people that say they don't want a new world order, basically say we're cop-killing terrorists is what the document states.
[01:00:56.041 --> 01:00:59.863]  And then we have bumper stickers where dangerous and evil that have Ron Paul on them.
[01:01:00.903 --> 01:01:02.644]  So, that's coming up.
[01:01:02.644 --> 01:01:04.925]  Right now, let's go to Dan in Wisconsin.
[01:01:04.925 --> 01:01:07.506]  Dan, you're on the air.
[01:01:07.506 --> 01:01:09.627]  Alex, you're the man!
[01:01:09.627 --> 01:01:10.627]  Love your show, brother.
[01:01:10.627 --> 01:01:19.191]  Hey, I wanted to ask you about a business idea, but I'm starting up a newspaper in a black spot.
[01:01:19.191 --> 01:01:20.611]  We've got to spread this information.
[01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:26.374]  Anybody who tells us that we need to stand down, or this is of the Lord, is ridiculous.
[01:01:26.374 --> 01:01:28.735]  We need to stand up, get off our horses, and get going.
[01:01:30.066 --> 01:01:40.734]  I was thinking about showing your new film, The Obama Deception, in a public forum and a player radio show also, my parents' sports bar, restaurant.
[01:01:40.734 --> 01:01:50.441]  I want to know how good of a business idea you think that would be with the spreading of this liberty movement and how hot it is with everybody.
[01:01:50.441 --> 01:01:53.363]  What, a business idea of selling The Obama Deception?
[01:01:55.096 --> 01:02:04.085]  No, airing your radio show during business hours, catching on with this liberty movement, how many people are waking up to what's going on here?
[01:02:04.085 --> 01:02:06.728]  Yeah, I think the way to do it is at first
[01:02:08.046 --> 01:02:09.287]  Do it the way the globalists do it.
[01:02:09.287 --> 01:02:09.927]  Phase it in.
[01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:12.789]  Have it on a smaller radio at one corner.
[01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:14.730]  I don't know how big your facility is.
[01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:19.753]  And have people start getting into it and listening so they're not overall assaulted by it.
[01:02:19.753 --> 01:02:31.040]  And then as people start liking it, then in a month or so, you could have it on a few hours a day and then start putting it on most of the time all over the restaurant.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.561]  Excellent, excellent.
[01:02:52.581 --> 01:02:59.605]  Also, I tried some of your sponsors, E-Foods Direct, the Five Star Soap, Get the T, those are all awesome products.
[01:02:59.605 --> 01:03:00.706]  So, go out and get those guys.
[01:03:00.706 --> 01:03:03.608]  Well, Get the T isn't my sponsor.
[01:03:03.608 --> 01:03:07.110]  I'm not saying it's not a fine sponsor.
[01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:09.911]  I just haven't tried it, so I'm not endorsing it.
[01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:10.912]  Okay.
[01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:11.672]  Well, thanks Alex.
[01:03:11.672 --> 01:03:12.673]  Keep up the good work.
[01:03:12.673 --> 01:03:16.555]  Hey, thank you so much, sir, for all the support.
[01:03:16.555 --> 01:03:19.197]  Let's go ahead and take another call here quickly.
[01:03:19.197 --> 01:03:20.637]  Let's talk to Sean in Illinois.
[01:03:20.637 --> 01:03:21.218]  Go ahead, Sean.
[01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:23.863]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:03:23.863 --> 01:03:25.784]  Good, sir.
[01:03:25.784 --> 01:03:31.846]  Alright, I've heard something disgusting this morning on my way in from work.
[01:03:31.846 --> 01:03:33.206]  You know, it's kind of funny.
[01:03:33.206 --> 01:03:38.548]  We get rid of Blagojevich, you know, for all the crime and all the stuff that he's committed.
[01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:44.130]  Now, here comes Pat Quinn, and what I hear this morning, all of a sudden he wants to propose all these tax hikes.
[01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:51.972]  He's actually talking about a 50% tax income tax for us, and I want the Illinois listeners to take note of this.
[01:03:52.739 --> 01:03:56.380]  Make a big stink out of it, because seriously, I mean, it's getting ridiculous.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:04.981]  Um, he's also, uh, price for the, uh, for our license sticker on our car is already, uh, $78, and I want to double that to almost a hundred bucks.
[01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:08.562]  I mean, all these taxes that he's proposed, and I mean, what's this?
[01:04:08.562 --> 01:04:16.003]  It's like, here, we, we have garbage out coming, uh, coming out from the garbage, and now here comes Pat Quinn, and it's just like, it's just the same thing all over again.
[01:04:16.003 --> 01:04:20.524]  It's like, people, we gotta wake up to this, and, you know, make a big stink out of this.
[01:04:21.343 --> 01:04:24.425]  Yeah, the New World Order are like shark teeth.
[01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:31.271]  As they remove one row of them, another row just flips up behind them.
[01:04:31.271 --> 01:04:33.292]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:04:33.292 --> 01:04:34.994]  And of course, what is his lame excuse?
[01:04:34.994 --> 01:04:42.319]  I didn't catch the whole thing, but I think one of his was, we need education, more education for the children.
[01:04:42.319 --> 01:04:47.544]  Yeah, more lame education for these prison camps, these re-education government camps.
[01:04:47.544 --> 01:04:49.505]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:04:49.505 --> 01:04:50.346]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:04:51.644 --> 01:04:52.545]  I hear you my friend.
[01:04:52.545 --> 01:04:53.386]  Good to hear from you.
[01:04:53.386 --> 01:04:54.908]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:54.908 --> 01:05:01.177]  More calls straight ahead and a state rep for Missouri's take on the MIAC state police report basically saying we're terrorists.
[01:05:01.177 --> 01:05:06.544]  How would you like to finally be debt-free without paying another cent to creditors and not have to file bankruptcy?
[01:05:06.604 --> 01:05:07.685]  We're good to go.
[01:05:25.623 --> 01:05:26.223]  We're good to go.
[01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:50.711]  Call 718-615-0123.
[01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:53.991]  That's 718-615-0123.

[01:06:01.573 --> 01:06:07.394]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.394 --> 01:06:14.416]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:21.543]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:23.525]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.525 --> 01:06:26.026]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:26.026 --> 01:06:36.995]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.595 --> 01:06:39.256]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:41.117]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:41.117 --> 01:06:48.040]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:56.304]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.864]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.864 --> 01:06:59.065]  The people strike back.
[01:07:01.642 --> 01:07:07.147]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:07:07.147 --> 01:07:07.947]  and the world.
[01:07:07.947 --> 01:07:11.790]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:18.296]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:07:18.296 --> 01:07:20.337]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:28.284]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:33.249]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:39.075]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:07:39.075 --> 01:07:41.237]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:07:41.237 --> 01:07:43.500]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.921]  Free of charge.
[01:07:44.921 --> 01:07:45.241]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.

[01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:49.543]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:07:49.543 --> 01:07:51.084]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:51.084 --> 01:07:52.485]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.383 --> 01:08:39.150]  We are fighting back against the globalist takeover, and so a lot of people that heard us talk about it 10, 12, 13, 14 years ago, many others speak of it, the films that were made, the books that were written, the tens of thousands of radio shows that were done, and the public is witnessing everything we discuss coming true, and so now, just this radio show alone, which is definitely the very tip of the spear, but a small part of the overall fight against the globalist, it's all of us together, everything we touch is exploding.
[01:08:39.943 --> 01:08:46.829]  You know, we told you it was illegal for the Army to be out there with MPs at the Alabama shooting after it happened, running checkpoints.
[01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:48.691]  And now that's in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:52.054]  Army reviews troop use after fatal Alabama shootings.
[01:08:52.054 --> 01:08:53.195]  Houston Chronicle.
[01:08:53.195 --> 01:08:54.356]  Here's CNS News.
[01:08:54.356 --> 01:08:58.740]  Army investigating how and why troops were sent into Alabama town after murder spree.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:03.585]  We broke here last Tuesday the MIAC, federally written report in Missouri.
[01:09:03.585 --> 01:09:04.346]  All states have them.
[01:09:04.346 --> 01:09:05.346]  I have them from other states.
[01:09:06.067 --> 01:09:07.988]  That's now blown up all over newspapers everywhere.
[01:09:07.988 --> 01:09:10.409]  We cover Bilderberg and Obama's secret meeting there.
[01:09:10.409 --> 01:09:13.190]  That's been on CBS News.
[01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:16.731]  Hundreds of newspapers ran the Politico article that I know of.
[01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:18.752]  Politico ran it.
[01:09:18.752 --> 01:09:21.233]  AOL wrote their own story linking to us.
[01:09:21.233 --> 01:09:23.134]  It is exploding right now.
[01:09:24.114 --> 01:09:27.558]  And it's just an amazing responsibility that we have here on the broadcast.
[01:09:27.558 --> 01:09:29.100]  And I want to thank my crew.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.061]  Rob Dewey, the producer.
[01:09:30.061 --> 01:09:32.063]  I want to thank Bill.
[01:09:32.063 --> 01:09:32.824]  I want to thank Jaron.
[01:09:32.824 --> 01:09:34.685]  I want to thank Paul.
[01:09:34.685 --> 01:09:37.288]  I want to thank the Watson Brothers, Curt Nemob.
[01:09:38.394 --> 01:09:48.720]  The folks in the back office, from customer service right on up, our IT people, Matt, we've hired an extra IT person, Matt doing a fabulous job.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.703]  I just want to commend all of these individuals, but it's a testament to what we can do when we take action.
[01:09:54.703 --> 01:10:00.947]  Now, coming up in a little while, I'm going to air a five-minute report that was done by a reporter.
[01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:04.272]  And we're going to try to get this reporter on, by the way, the next few days.
[01:10:04.272 --> 01:10:06.414]  We tried to get him on today, but they haven't contacted us back yet.
[01:10:06.414 --> 01:10:07.414]  Conversation with Sgt.
[01:10:07.414 --> 01:10:09.495]  Joe Clark at MIAC.
[01:10:09.495 --> 01:10:10.376]  And we called and checked.
[01:10:10.376 --> 01:10:13.357]  Joe Clark is one of the spokesmen at MIAC in Missouri.
[01:10:13.357 --> 01:10:17.860]  We've also talked to two other captains and listed their names.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:21.542]  They didn't want us to record the conversation with them, so we didn't.
[01:10:21.542 --> 01:10:22.643]  But that's on record.
[01:10:22.643 --> 01:10:24.704]  This MIAC report is real.
[01:10:24.704 --> 01:10:26.785]  Some people are still in denial about it.
[01:10:26.785 --> 01:10:28.406]  But this Joe Clark, Sgt.
[01:10:28.406 --> 01:10:29.427]  Joe Clark at MIAC,
[01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:34.969]  Says, oh it doesn't mention bumper stickers in there with Ron Paul.
[01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:35.649]  Well, yes it does.
[01:10:35.649 --> 01:10:39.510]  It does mention bumper stickers and we have the report and the video up there.
[01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:40.751]  It's a conversation with Sgt.
[01:10:40.751 --> 01:10:42.011]  Joe Clark of MIAC.
[01:10:42.011 --> 01:10:43.452]  We are not terrorists.
[01:10:43.452 --> 01:10:46.833]  That's the headline.
[01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:57.837]  The folks that made this video did a great job because they blew up the document and showed hyperlinks and arrows to where it does say bumper stickers.
[01:10:59.147 --> 01:11:01.007]  And the whole thing is about who wants to kill cops.
[01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:12.150]  The whole thing is there to scare police and say, oh my gosh, these libertarians, these Bob Barr supporters, these Ron Paul people, people that talk about the North American Union, they're dangerous, they're tied into white supremacists that want to kill you.
[01:11:12.150 --> 01:11:17.451]  So I thought I would get State Representative Jim Guest of Missouri on with us for a little while.
[01:11:17.451 --> 01:11:22.452]  He introduced the legislation, we'll get an update on that, to re-declare 9th and 10th Amendment.
[01:11:22.452 --> 01:11:27.853]  He spoke out against the North American Union and the globalists here on this show, which is publicly being put all over the news now.
[01:11:28.573 --> 01:11:31.155]  And so I wanted to get his response to the MIAC report.
[01:11:31.155 --> 01:11:37.500]  We called his office and he said that he was aware of the MIAC report there in his state.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.502]  Representative Jim Guess, thanks for coming back on with us.
[01:11:40.502 --> 01:11:51.831]  Thank you, Alex, and I thank you for helping spread the word and expose us, gosh, another intrusion into our freedom and our personal privacy that we think we have.
[01:11:51.831 --> 01:11:54.293]  But every day it seems like there's an attack on it.
[01:11:55.063 --> 01:11:56.785]  Boy, this is outrageous.
[01:11:56.785 --> 01:12:05.012]  Tell us when you first learned of this federally written and prepared, but issued by the governor's office and the state police, report in your state.
[01:12:05.012 --> 01:12:06.473]  That was last Thursday.
[01:12:06.473 --> 01:12:09.256]  We were last day of session before we took our spring break here.
[01:12:09.256 --> 01:12:18.704]  Just before I went into session, I got a quick couple of emails that sort of brought it up, but the report was rather hazy, and honestly, I was very skeptical of it.
[01:12:18.704 --> 01:12:20.426]  I thought, surely they haven't gone this far.
[01:12:21.167 --> 01:12:28.871]  And we were busy that day, and probably about the middle of the afternoon when I got back, my staff had contacted a couple of public information officers over at my end.
[01:12:28.871 --> 01:12:32.513]  And I talked to them, and they confirmed that it is authentic.
[01:12:32.513 --> 01:12:37.076]  And anybody out there that disputes this, I guarantee it is authentic.
[01:12:37.076 --> 01:12:38.577]  It's the real thing.
[01:12:38.577 --> 01:12:44.080]  And I would have to say, when I was talking to them, they were giving the canned public information response.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.021]  But you could kind of tell by the tone of their voice
[01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:49.998]  That they actually didn't believe it, that they had gone too far.
[01:12:49.998 --> 01:13:01.085]  I am setting up a meeting when I get back to Capitol next week with, uh, I'm not sure whether I get a, I'm going to get a meeting with Van Gossie, the director, hopefully with Doug Middleton.
[01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:06.068]  He's a CIA, that's criminal intelligence analyst to sit down in my office.
[01:13:06.068 --> 01:13:10.210]  And we're going to have a, uh, get down to the earth meeting here.
[01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:12.872]  And I think we certainly demand an apology.
[01:13:12.872 --> 01:13:14.513]  They need to come out and explain.
[01:13:15.697 --> 01:13:18.659]  Well, they are on it, if they want to include all of us in there.
[01:13:18.659 --> 01:13:29.567]  And, you know, I'm sure that I'm one of them not mentioned, but I've got my pipe, my Committee for America's Freedom, which outlines all these things, which kind of oppose some of the things of our federal government.
[01:13:29.567 --> 01:13:32.028]  I've got Laurie, it's legislation against Real ID.
[01:13:32.028 --> 01:13:35.511]  It's a nationwide coalition to stop the Real ID.
[01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:43.296]  And, you know, those all tie into the RFID capsule, so it all ties together there.
[01:13:44.355 --> 01:13:45.296]  It's outrageous.
[01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:53.540]  They say that there are a lot of peaceful groups that help police and have soup kitchens, but they're really secret and dangerous, too.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:14:05.587]  And there's groups that don't like the RFID, and there's those that don't like gun control, and there's those that like the Libertarians and Ron Paul, and then they sandwich it in between groups that want to kill police.
[01:14:05.587 --> 01:14:08.749]  I mean, this is clear guilt by association.
[01:14:08.749 --> 01:14:09.409]  Absolutely.
[01:14:09.409 --> 01:14:11.090]  He says, well, it's not all inclusive.
[01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:13.031]  I think when you put something this broad,
[01:14:13.556 --> 01:14:21.140]  And I was one of the first ones, I think, to introduce Ron Paul when he kicked off his presidential campaign about two years ago in Kansas City.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:29.244]  And then a couple weeks later, I helped introduce him in Des Moines, and I spent a couple days traveling with him in Iowa on his campaign.
[01:14:29.244 --> 01:14:39.989]  And I was in Washington, D.C., and one of those had spoke there at the Freedom March out there, so I'm sure that I'm one that they include in there.
[01:14:39.989 --> 01:14:41.190]  But, you know, who?
[01:14:42.014 --> 01:14:51.858]  What better patriot do you have somebody like Ron Paul to start with who always votes according to the Constitution and believes in protecting America?
[01:14:51.858 --> 01:14:54.679]  Chuck Baldwin is following in his steps.
[01:14:54.679 --> 01:14:58.681]  And you got Bob Barr who heads up the Libertarian Party.
[01:14:58.681 --> 01:15:02.182]  These are not the militant people out there.
[01:15:02.182 --> 01:15:04.723]  They are peaceful people who want to see
[01:15:05.663 --> 01:15:06.223]  That's right.
[01:15:06.223 --> 01:15:09.944]  You know, they keep talking about this 10th Amendment that we want to overthrow the government.
[01:15:09.944 --> 01:15:13.826]  All we want to do is get back to govern the way the Constitution says.
[01:15:13.826 --> 01:15:16.487]  That's what it says, not to throw the government out.
[01:15:16.487 --> 01:15:18.527]  We want them to just abide by the rules.
[01:15:18.527 --> 01:15:18.928]  That's right.
[01:15:18.928 --> 01:15:21.208]  The states created the federal government.
[01:15:21.208 --> 01:15:23.129]  The states control it.
[01:15:23.129 --> 01:15:24.970]  And that's in the Declaration of Independence.
[01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:26.010]  It's in the Constitution.
[01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:27.591]  It's in the Bill of Rights.
[01:15:27.591 --> 01:15:30.612]  And anyone that claims that that is a lie is lying.
[01:15:32.017 --> 01:15:32.537]  You bet.
[01:15:32.537 --> 01:15:35.220]  And, you know, they talk about these bumper stickers.
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:43.967]  I guarantee you, when they pull somebody over that says, end the Fed, or stop the IRS, or listen to Alex Jones, who knows what kind of bumper stickers are out there.
[01:15:44.451 --> 01:15:48.673]  They're going to include those people in there as being people to be watchful for.
[01:15:48.673 --> 01:16:00.958]  Well they list, I mean they list Ron Paul, Bob Barr and others and list bumper stickers and there's actually YouTube videos people have shot out of their cars in Las Vegas and other places where the police do pull them over for Ron Paul stickers.
[01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:11.702]  So there have been people who have had their houses busted into for Ron Paul signs or for upside down flags, which is not a disrespect, even if it was it's free speech, but it's a sign of distress.
[01:16:12.562 --> 01:16:16.285]  So we have seen persecution against Ron Paul supporters.
[01:16:16.285 --> 01:16:28.555]  It is, and you know, just because he has a movement going, he's got his campaign for liberty now, and I guess they obviously consider that a... Oh no, they list that, they list that, as you know.
[01:16:28.555 --> 01:16:33.699]  I know, and these are people who obviously we need more of.
[01:16:33.699 --> 01:16:36.602]  What gets me when they take sovereign citizens, you know?
[01:16:36.602 --> 01:16:37.923]  That's what I'm working for here.
[01:16:38.447 --> 01:16:42.570]  Sovereign citizens and a sovereign government, sovereign state.
[01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:48.575]  That's what it's all about and try and demonize us and put us in that category that is just
[01:16:49.341 --> 01:16:51.562]  It's outrageous what they're doing.
[01:16:51.562 --> 01:16:54.363]  Well, why do you think they were trying to keep it secret?
[01:16:54.363 --> 01:16:57.303]  I mean, clearly they're embarrassed of what they're doing.
[01:16:57.303 --> 01:17:00.324]  This is dirty, dark propaganda.
[01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:08.847]  It's lies and guilt by association, so that's why they try to keep this so secret, but I don't want you to feel bad just for your fine state, the show-me state, Missouri.
[01:17:08.847 --> 01:17:15.629]  We have gotten these reports in different variants, different forms, different permutations from all 50 states.
[01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:17.930]  Yeah, luckily we've got somebody here who
[01:17:18.746 --> 01:17:20.807]  I didn't realize the danger that this was.
[01:17:20.807 --> 01:17:27.089]  But, you know, on the back page of this, you know, it says, unclassified, law enforcement sensitive.
[01:17:27.089 --> 01:17:34.432]  And it says, all information considered in this newsletter should be considered law enforcement sensitive.
[01:17:34.432 --> 01:17:39.294]  No report or segment thereof may be released to any media sources.
[01:17:39.294 --> 01:17:39.874]  Hmm.
[01:17:39.874 --> 01:17:41.675]  Why would that be?
[01:17:41.675 --> 01:17:47.417]  Information herein may not be MAC, M-I-S-A, originated intelligence unless
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:49.101]  Noted.
[01:17:49.101 --> 01:18:02.432]  So, they've got caught here and hopefully they'll do the right thing and come out and make a public apology.
[01:18:02.432 --> 01:18:07.877]  I'm sure that this came from a higher level down when you start looking at everything that's delineated in there.
[01:18:07.877 --> 01:18:10.519]  This wasn't something that just originated at the state level.
[01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:13.082]  I think they can go back several years and see some similar
[01:18:14.534 --> 01:18:18.958]  I think people need to realize, and I'm sure most of them do, listen to your program, Alex.
[01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:48.882]  On 9-11, President George Bush said, an attack on one is an attack on all.
[01:18:48.882 --> 01:19:00.028]  In other words, an attack on one's freedom is going to be an attack on everybody's freedom, whether you're included as part of the Ron Paul movement or the Constitution Party or not.
[01:19:00.028 --> 01:19:05.571]  If you stand back and allow somebody else's freedom to take away, you're going to be next in line.
[01:19:07.213 --> 01:19:08.054]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:19:08.054 --> 01:19:18.542]  We're going to break and I want to come back for one more quick segment with you and specifically talk about how you're trying to get the director of your state police or the director of the MIAC program in your office.
[01:19:18.542 --> 01:19:23.566]  But they are saying that one of them will be coming to your office next week?
[01:19:23.566 --> 01:19:27.269]  They were at the meeting with me when I left last week there.
[01:19:27.269 --> 01:19:30.192]  So they're saying they will be coming to have a meeting with you?
[01:19:30.192 --> 01:19:32.533]  That's what they said and we'll see.
[01:19:32.533 --> 01:19:35.516]  In the meantime, of course, this is right after it broke and they may not have
[01:19:36.098 --> 01:19:39.239]  Realize the full repercussions of what was happening.
[01:19:39.239 --> 01:19:43.180]  But certainly, I'm putting out a public statement on it.
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:46.501]  And if not, we'll continue to hit the media with it.
[01:19:46.501 --> 01:19:48.761]  Alright, Representative Jim Guest of Missouri.
[01:19:48.761 --> 01:19:49.601]  You heard him.
[01:19:49.601 --> 01:19:52.002]  There at the Capitol.
[01:19:52.002 --> 01:19:53.382]  He called the state police.
[01:19:53.382 --> 01:19:54.223]  It's real.
[01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:55.003]  They put it out.
[01:19:56.035 --> 01:20:01.137]  We're going to come back with a representative to finish up, talk about where their move for 10th Amendment sovereignty is going.
[01:20:01.137 --> 01:20:09.379]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:20:09.379 --> 01:20:13.941]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:20:13.941 --> 01:20:18.623]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:20:18.623 --> 01:20:20.023]  It's a documented fact.
[01:20:20.903 --> 01:20:27.666]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:20:27.666 --> 01:20:39.770]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:43.431]  FPP is now available to you from FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[01:20:44.031 --> 01:20:47.174]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[01:20:47.174 --> 01:20:50.917]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[01:20:50.917 --> 01:20:54.400]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:54.600]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:59.684]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:07.811 --> 01:21:15.933]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:15.933 --> 01:21:24.095]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:24.095 --> 01:21:28.856]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:29.176 --> 01:21:34.419]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:34.419 --> 01:21:38.761]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:39.842]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:39.842 --> 01:21:44.344]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:44.344 --> 01:21:49.247]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:49.247 --> 01:21:52.248]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:52.248 --> 01:21:53.889]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:57.571 --> 01:22:01.174]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.174 --> 01:22:07.218]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.218 --> 01:22:12.502]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.098 --> 01:22:19.581]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.581 --> 01:22:21.561]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:24.022]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:37.208]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.208 --> 01:22:38.868]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.868 --> 01:22:40.229]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.726 --> 01:22:47.629]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:55.892]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:55.892 --> 01:22:57.472]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:58.673]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.424 --> 01:23:10.996]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:23:10.996 --> 01:23:12.417]  Garden in a can!
[01:23:12.417 --> 01:23:16.562]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.

[01:23:31.019 --> 01:23:32.440]  Garden in a can.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.642]  It's that simple.
[01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:34.343]  Fresh.
[01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:35.224]  Healthy.
[01:23:35.224 --> 01:23:36.045]  Easy.
[01:23:36.045 --> 01:23:40.390]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[01:24:19.947 --> 01:24:23.990]  Just a heads up to AMNFM affiliates out there.
[01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:33.798]  When I start the next hour for about 10-15 minutes, I'm going to be simulcasting with Judge Andrew Napolitano's Freedom Watch radio slash TV show.
[01:24:33.798 --> 01:24:36.160]  So we're going to skip that five to
[01:24:37.734 --> 01:24:43.297]  Eight after break, so stations can carry that or not, whatever you want to do.
[01:24:43.297 --> 01:24:45.698]  But that's coming up.
[01:24:45.698 --> 01:24:53.142]  Folks can watch us live at PrisonPlanet.tv, or you can listen, obviously, over the internet streams at InfoWars.com or on your MRFM dial out there.
[01:24:53.142 --> 01:24:57.424]  Finishing up with Representative Jim Guest out of Missouri, confirming again from another source
[01:24:57.984 --> 01:25:08.486]  We've called them ourselves, that yes, the feds gave them this report, they put it out to the state, demonizing basically the only people fighting the takeover by the foreign banks of the United States.
[01:25:08.486 --> 01:25:22.930]  Representative, in the last few weeks, I mean it was dozens of articles a day, now it's hundreds of articles a day, the mainstream news saying world government's real, but it's good, and the banks will issue the global currency, you will pay taxes to them,
[01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:29.671]  And then meanwhile, the police everywhere being taught we're insane and terrorist if we believe in it or fight it.
[01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:38.134]  I mean, this is a classic takeover here where they're teaching the enforcers, who should be the defenders of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, who swore oaths to it, that it's bad.
[01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:39.814]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:25:39.814 --> 01:25:40.354]  It is.
[01:25:40.354 --> 01:25:52.337]  I just, you know, the real scary part is here they're trying to indoctrinate the police into thinking that those who support the Constitution Party, Libertarian, are the enemy.
[01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:59.022]  And actually, if you look down through this here, a lot of this stuff pretty well mirrors the platform of the Republican Party.
[01:25:59.022 --> 01:26:04.904]  Enforcement of the Second Amendment, the pro-life, and some other things out there.
[01:26:04.904 --> 01:26:16.069]  My Committee for America's Freedom, you know, I oppose the Real ID Act, the National Aniline, and my second one is to stop this North American Union, that's right in line with it.
[01:26:16.069 --> 01:26:22.112]  I say that's repeal, revise the Patriot Act, so many of my issues that I and others are working for
[01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:38.402]  They would put in this category here, so I think it's very important for people to realize, just because they've pointed at the Constitution, the Libertarian Party, and Chuck Baldwin and those, that's not who all they're after.
[01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:42.146]  They just happen to be the figurehead hero they're pointing at.
[01:26:42.146 --> 01:26:49.652]  So, just because you don't think you're included in this right now, the next go around, the next round up, you will be.
[01:26:50.029 --> 01:26:51.830]  Well, let's just go down the line here.
[01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:55.992]  In most polls, 65% or more of Americans are now against abortion.
[01:26:55.992 --> 01:26:59.693]  In most polls, upwards of 70% of Americans are pro-Second Amendment.
[01:26:59.693 --> 01:27:03.595]  In most polls, 91% in Gallup Poll are against open borders.
[01:27:03.595 --> 01:27:05.716]  It lists those people as basically terrorists.
[01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:16.726]  Not just what is constitutional and in our Bill of Rights, but our American way of life is evil, but it also lists basically all Americans as bad.
[01:27:16.726 --> 01:27:24.254]  Because what's constitutional is also always very popular because the Constitution is a beautiful document compared to what we have today.
[01:27:24.254 --> 01:27:29.780]  In closing, how is the resolution to declare Tenth Amendment state sovereignty going in Missouri?
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:31.020]  It's going well.
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:34.622]  It'll be up for a vote on the House floor, possibly next week.
[01:27:34.622 --> 01:27:35.982]  We have to take up our budget.
[01:27:35.982 --> 01:27:41.624]  So it's one of those issues that the body has been alerted to prepare for.
[01:27:41.624 --> 01:27:47.946]  So I think we've got solid support for it, and hopefully we'll get that through by the end of session there.
[01:27:47.946 --> 01:27:51.307]  So hopefully we can join the other states that have got that passed through.
[01:27:51.307 --> 01:27:56.549]  So I think it sends a strong message that we do want to get back to the basic
[01:27:57.330 --> 01:27:57.850]  I don't know.
[01:28:11.428 --> 01:28:13.110]  Absolutely.
[01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:16.313]  I know there's always a rush of bills, and that's the toughest part.
[01:28:16.313 --> 01:28:20.337]  You believe you have the votes, but the question is, can you get it to the floor?
[01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:25.863]  Would you say you're 80% certain it's going to pass, or should people call their representatives?
[01:28:25.863 --> 01:28:32.810]  I'm 80% certain it'll pass the House floor there, and I've got a senator over there that's very strongly, very strongly supportive of it.
[01:28:33.867 --> 01:28:34.588]  I think so.
[01:28:55.379 --> 01:28:57.641]  Protect yourself any place on your own property.
[01:28:57.641 --> 01:29:00.103]  Don't have to retreat to your house.
[01:29:00.103 --> 01:29:07.869]  Representative Jim Gaston, closing, were other members of the legislature there outraged by the MIAC report?
[01:29:07.869 --> 01:29:08.510]  They were.
[01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:11.672]  It's a matter of most of them probably hadn't even heard of it.
[01:29:11.672 --> 01:29:15.175]  So, like I said, that was the last day we went out of session.
[01:29:15.175 --> 01:29:23.022]  And I know many of them have received emails from supporters of my legislation, so they'll certainly be up to speed by the time we get back next week.
[01:29:23.698 --> 01:29:24.239]  Absolutely.
[01:29:24.239 --> 01:29:26.000]  Give us your website.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:39.151]  My website is JimGuest.com at the capitol, or you can go to TheJimGuestShow.com, that's one, or Lori, LegislatorsAgainstRealLife.com.
[01:29:39.151 --> 01:29:42.014]  Any one of those you can log on to and find more information.
[01:29:42.014 --> 01:29:43.335]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:29:43.335 --> 01:29:43.835]  Keep it up.
[01:29:43.835 --> 01:29:46.377]  We'll talk to you after you meet with the state police next week.
[01:29:46.377 --> 01:29:47.398]  Take care.
[01:29:47.398 --> 01:29:48.099]  Thank you.
[01:29:48.099 --> 01:29:48.639]  Thank you, sir.
[01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:49.220]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.471 --> 01:29:54.472]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.472 --> 01:30:01.975]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.975 --> 01:30:06.037]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[01:30:06.037 --> 01:30:07.937]  You are not alone.
[01:30:07.937 --> 01:30:10.798]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[01:30:10.798 --> 01:30:15.860]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.601]  Signs include itching, pulling,
[01:30:17.961 --> 01:30:18.281]  I think so.
[01:30:32.978 --> 01:30:33.318]  Let's do it!
[01:31:01.832 --> 01:31:07.662]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.662 --> 01:31:14.714]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:15.231 --> 01:31:21.816]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.816 --> 01:31:23.798]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.798 --> 01:31:26.300]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:37.869]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.869 --> 01:31:39.551]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.551 --> 01:31:40.892]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:41.391 --> 01:31:48.296]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:48.296 --> 01:31:56.562]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:56.562 --> 01:31:58.143]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:58.143 --> 01:31:59.344]  The people strike back.
[01:32:01.226 --> 01:32:09.953]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:32:09.953 --> 01:32:15.076]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[01:32:15.076 --> 01:32:15.937]  and Canada.
[01:32:15.937 --> 01:32:22.462]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:32:23.044 --> 01:32:26.425]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:32:26.425 --> 01:32:28.866]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:32:28.866 --> 01:32:35.468]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:32:35.468 --> 01:32:38.989]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[01:32:51.414 --> 01:32:55.075]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[01:32:55.075 --> 01:32:56.976]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[01:32:56.976 --> 01:32:58.457]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[01:33:16.055 --> 01:33:24.482]  This is the end, my only friend, the end of our elaborate plans.
[01:33:24.482 --> 01:33:26.703]  The end of everything.
[01:33:34.957 --> 01:33:40.302]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back live!
[01:33:56.249 --> 01:33:57.952]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:57.952 --> 01:34:01.657]  It is Wednesday, the 18th day of March 2009.
[01:34:01.657 --> 01:34:03.921]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:34:03.921 --> 01:34:09.369]  We'll be simulcasting for a little bit next hour with Judge Napolitano's radio show slash webcast at Fox News.
[01:34:12.737 --> 01:34:14.959]  See how that goes.
[01:34:14.959 --> 01:34:19.343]  And we will be going live at PrisonPlanet.tv at the start of the next segment.
[01:34:19.343 --> 01:34:21.585]  I want to go to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:34:21.585 --> 01:34:23.567]  First, I want to throw a plug out there.
[01:34:23.567 --> 01:34:24.688]  The DVDs are in.
[01:34:25.762 --> 01:34:28.064]  Here's one of my little hands.
[01:34:28.064 --> 01:34:36.429]  Again, the super high quality official DVD with the extras, the DNC 2008 coverage, the provocateurs, the extended interview section.
[01:34:56.262 --> 01:34:58.763]  We have reached a critical juncture in the New World Order's plans.
[01:34:58.763 --> 01:35:01.224]  It's not about left and right, it's about a one world government.
[01:35:01.224 --> 01:35:06.685]  The international bankers plan to loot the people of the United States and turn them into slaves on a global plantation.
[01:35:06.685 --> 01:35:11.407]  Covered in this film, who Obama works for, what lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:35:11.407 --> 01:35:15.148]  If you want to know the facts and cut through all the hype, this is the film for you.
[01:35:16.488 --> 01:35:18.950]  Watch the Obama Deception and learn how.
[01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:31.380]  Obama is continuing the process of transforming America into something that resembles Nazi Germany, with forced national service, domestic civilian spies, warrantless wiretaps, and the destruction of the Second Amendment, FEMA camps, and martial law.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:38.246]  Obama's handlers are openly announcing the creation of a new Bank of the World that will dominate every nation on Earth through carbon taxes and military force.
[01:35:39.608 --> 01:35:46.332]  International bankers purposely have engineered the worldwide financial meltdown to bankrupt the nations of the planet and bring in world government.
[01:35:46.332 --> 01:35:54.177]  Obama's plans to loot the middle class, destroy pensions, and federalize the states so that the population is completely dependent on the central government.
[01:35:54.177 --> 01:35:55.998]  It's self-controlled by world government.
[01:35:55.998 --> 01:36:04.964]  The elite are using Obama to pacify the public so that they can usher in their North American Union by stealth, launch a new Cold War, and continue the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:36:06.104 --> 01:36:07.865]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:36:07.865 --> 01:36:12.489]  The information contained in this film is vital to the future of the Republic and to freedom worldwide.
[01:36:12.489 --> 01:36:16.753]  President Barack Obama is only the tool of a larger agenda.
[01:36:16.753 --> 01:36:22.117]  Until all are made aware, humanity will remain captive to the masters of the New World Order.
[01:36:22.117 --> 01:36:26.081]  And its runtime is one hundred and
[01:36:27.372 --> 01:36:33.099]  Twelve minutes with 20 plus minutes of bonus features and materiel.
[01:36:33.099 --> 01:36:36.083]  Again, it is the Obama Deception.
[01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:42.190]  Ladies and gentlemen, get the super high quality DVD at the shopping cart, the bookstore and video shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:43.291 --> 01:36:44.472]  Or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:44.472 --> 01:36:44.592]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:44.592 --> 01:36:48.035]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:48.696]  Again, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:37:03.356 --> 01:37:07.717]  The Obama deception, the mask is now removed, the people are striking back with the truth.
[01:37:07.717 --> 01:37:11.638]  You can also watch it in super high quality, burn it, DivX versions to disc or DVD.
[01:37:11.638 --> 01:37:21.981]  Get it out to everybody at PrisonPlanet.tv and your support is vital to continue our operation, to continue expanding our operation, and to continue reaching out to more and more people and making future films.
[01:37:21.981 --> 01:37:23.562]  Let's go to Brett in Montana.
[01:37:23.562 --> 01:37:24.942]  Brett, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[01:37:26.417 --> 01:37:30.144]  Hey, I'd just like to make a couple comments and ask you a question real quick.
[01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:37.818]  First of all, about the Mayak report, which is complete and utter crap.
[01:37:37.818 --> 01:37:38.580]  I can't believe
[01:37:39.395 --> 01:37:45.960]  The stuff that is on here about the don't tread on me flag or stuff like that.
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:55.708]  I mean, sir, if you're mad at that, did you see the Violent Radicalization Act hearings in Congress where they showed mainline architects and engineers from 9-11 truth as terrorists?
[01:37:55.708 --> 01:37:58.771]  I mean, they actually showed them with al-Qaeda as if these are terrorists.
[01:37:58.771 --> 01:38:01.072]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[01:38:01.072 --> 01:38:07.598]  You know, I seriously hope that there are police officers and
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:21.053]  And such, listening to your program today, because all it takes is just a little bit of investigation on your part to figure out that this is complete and utter crap.
[01:38:21.053 --> 01:38:30.542]  And let me tell you, it's just in history, you know, the Don't Tread On Me flag has been around
[01:38:31.246 --> 01:38:32.847]  You know, since 1775.
[01:38:32.847 --> 01:38:46.278]  They're training the police that anybody that... In the military today, if you go on YouTube, you can do a search for the Commandant's Own.
[01:38:46.278 --> 01:38:58.487]  It's an official United States Marine Corps commercial for the Drum and Bugle Corps.
[01:38:58.487 --> 01:39:00.949]  And in that, they
[01:39:02.662 --> 01:39:05.563]  Show, don't tread on me, flags.
[01:39:05.563 --> 01:39:09.765]  They show Betsy Ross flags.
[01:39:09.765 --> 01:39:12.947]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call, Brett.
[01:39:12.947 --> 01:39:20.291]  Look, it is meant to demonize free speech period and anybody that resists global tyranny.
[01:39:20.291 --> 01:39:22.752]  And they do think the police are stupid to be showing them this.
[01:39:22.752 --> 01:39:26.194]  They do think that they can get away with it and they're not getting away with it.
[01:39:26.194 --> 01:39:28.155]  Mike in Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:39:28.155 --> 01:39:29.936]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:39:29.936 --> 01:39:31.137]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:39:33.398 --> 01:40:02.093]  This morning on the Washington Journal on C-SPAN, the last guest that they had on there was a writer from the Politico, and I got my call in at that time, and he was invited on to speak to the bailout of AIG, and I referenced back to the other article in Politico, the Bilderberg's Excite Conspiracist, and then was able to
[01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:14.503]  You mentioned that they quoted you, the producer of the Obama Deception, and that they used information from both your websites and was able to name them on there.
[01:40:14.503 --> 01:40:16.184]  Good job!
[01:40:16.184 --> 01:40:29.311]  And specifically, part of the reference was to the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission and the CFR, and how did this gentleman feel that it impacted on the planning and the implementation
[01:40:30.268 --> 01:40:56.669]  of the new world order isn't so far as the banking problem and uh... i was also able to suggest that they invite either yourself or mister revere or mixed mister rams on an interview them and one of the same uh... they've the last part they just said they would consider it it's not that i have suggested that before to you know and they always say well what will take it under advisement or whatever and but when the uh...
[01:40:57.304 --> 01:41:09.174]  Gentlemen, the writer, Mr. Javers, he knew who had written the article, but he said he hadn't read the article, so he couldn't really comment on it.
[01:41:09.174 --> 01:41:12.917]  And he really didn't tie anything that I had mentioned back in.
[01:41:12.917 --> 01:41:14.178]  Hey, it doesn't matter.
[01:41:14.178 --> 01:41:16.800]  You got a lot of info out from what you just said.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:23.125]  Well, I was going to kind of suggest that maybe at one point before the election, lots of people were calling in.
[01:41:23.717 --> 01:41:28.300]  To the Washington Journal, and Ron Paul was appearing on there.
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:38.127]  And, you know, after they got their man in, then basically it was always, you know, they were just, how are we going to continue with our criminal activity?
[01:41:38.127 --> 01:41:42.390]  But, you know, occasionally they let somebody on that's worth watching.
[01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:45.372]  You know, like I say, I've seen Ron Paul on there more than once.
[01:41:46.673 --> 01:41:49.836]  And I thought maybe some of your audience might like to call in.
[01:41:49.836 --> 01:41:58.984]  You know, we have contacted C-SPAN probably, I don't know, 75 or more times saying, hey, we're having an event, would you like to cover it live or tape it?
[01:41:58.984 --> 01:42:02.447]  And they've done that one time for our 9-11 Truth Symposium.
[01:42:02.447 --> 01:42:05.389]  They covered about an hour and 46 minutes of it.
[01:42:05.389 --> 01:42:09.112]  They told me at an hour and a half, but we went for an hour and 46 minutes in one particular panel.
[01:42:10.033 --> 01:42:17.297]  And that's the extra on TerrorStorm as part of that panel, but you can see it there in that film on the DVD.
[01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:25.142]  But also you can, you know, just 9-11 Truth Symposium, C-SPAN, you can Google that and you can find the video up on the web on YouTube and Google.
[01:42:26.022 --> 01:42:34.548]  But the other times they've just ignored us, and then Brian Lamb and others will have people on there for hit pieces against me, or they attack me at nauseam.
[01:42:34.548 --> 01:42:35.348]  But that's fine.
[01:42:35.348 --> 01:42:45.515]  People have such mistrust for mainstream media and even C-SPAN, which is one of the better ones out there, they allow more diversity of ideas, that it's good when they attack me, it's just as good.
[01:42:45.515 --> 01:42:54.081]  Because people know, oh wait, this is the corrupt establishment, I better check out Alex Jones, because the liars are saying that he's bad.
[01:42:56.262 --> 01:42:59.584]  And I was able to mention a lot of things to an audience.
[01:42:59.584 --> 01:43:02.086]  You know, I can call into your show and preach, you know, to the choir.
[01:43:18.564 --> 01:43:30.852]  But I named a number of things that an audience that might not be calling in or looking at your show would now be aware of, you know, and identified you as an expert in the field.
[01:43:31.385 --> 01:43:33.966]  No, no, I appreciate you and good to hear from you, Mike.
[01:43:33.966 --> 01:43:35.807]  Super job.
[01:43:35.807 --> 01:43:37.588]  This is preaching to the choir overall.
[01:43:37.588 --> 01:43:55.337]  I mean, I would say 90% of our audience are folks that tune in every day or every few days, but every day there's that 10% or more who are driving down the road listening to AM FM or sent an audio clip or sent a link to the audio streams or tuning around on shortwave or tuning around on satellite or people that I've gone, you know, I go, I do
[01:43:55.877 --> 01:43:56.498]  Rejoice, Alex.
[01:43:56.498 --> 01:43:57.859]  Hey, here's a couple weird phrases.
[01:43:57.859 --> 01:43:58.599]  Thanks to Congress,
[01:44:27.186 --> 01:44:30.769]  Mexico leads the way to freedom for all of us.
[01:44:30.769 --> 01:44:35.712]  And it's true because, you know, yesterday morning, Mexico announced new tariffs against the U.S.
[01:44:35.712 --> 01:44:38.034]  in retaliation to the Congress.
[01:44:38.863 --> 01:44:39.123]  of the U.S.
[01:44:57.978 --> 01:45:04.261]  With the South American Union, three years ago, they finally let the French vote, and they said, we don't want to expand the EU.
[01:45:04.261 --> 01:45:07.402]  They finally let the Irish vote, they said, we don't want to be part of the EU.
[01:45:07.402 --> 01:45:09.623]  Globalism is in retreat everywhere.
[01:45:09.623 --> 01:45:21.709]  That's why the New World Order is staging terror attacks, trying to launch new wars, and causing the world financial crisis to bankrupt everybody, where we've got to go hat in hand to the very bankers that make all the money out of fiat with the stroke of a pen.
[01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:26.091]  Instead, we say, no, we don't go hat in hand to you, we arrest you for all the crimes you've committed.
[01:45:26.803 --> 01:45:27.223]  You're right.
[01:45:27.223 --> 01:45:37.087]  I mean, I think it's great that Mexico denies us, or is angry about us denying access, because it violates NAFTA, which is great!
[01:45:37.087 --> 01:45:42.430]  Well, under the North American Union Agreements, that is exactly what's going on.
[01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:49.773]  And the most important provision of NAFTA allows for the U.S., Mexico, or Canada to, at any time, unilaterally withdraw from the treaty.
[01:45:49.773 --> 01:45:50.813]  And here it is, people!
[01:45:50.813 --> 01:45:55.175]  Now, I believe we have the ways, means, and motivation, obvious motivation,
[01:45:55.848 --> 01:45:57.950]  Unilaterally withdraw from NAFTA.
[01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:59.111]  The public demanded it.
[01:45:59.111 --> 01:46:08.498]  Well, I mean, you've got polls of 90 plus percent against, well, it was 90 plus percent against it when they passed it back in 94, but absolutely, the people want it.
[01:46:08.498 --> 01:46:13.442]  It's destroyed our economy and NAFTA and GATT, which was the major stepping stone of the North American Union.
[01:46:13.442 --> 01:46:14.203]  Good to hear from you.
[01:46:14.203 --> 01:46:16.265]  Excellent points.
[01:46:16.265 --> 01:46:18.106]  Let's talk to James in Pennsylvania.
[01:46:18.106 --> 01:46:18.987]  James, you're on the air.
[01:46:18.987 --> 01:46:20.688]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:20.688 --> 01:46:21.729]  I have a question for you.
[01:46:22.375 --> 01:46:36.185]  I'm a senior in high school right now, and I've been accepted to Pittsburgh University, and they're the honors colleges I'm pretty proud about, but I really don't know if I should go, if that's going to be good in the next two or three years, if I'd even be able to finish my degree.
[01:46:36.185 --> 01:46:40.468]  What's your thoughts on that, and how colleges will play out in the next couple years?
[01:46:40.468 --> 01:46:42.870]  I mean, specifically, you're asking if you should stay in college?
[01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:45.532]  You're asking what I think is going to happen?
[01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:48.174]  Well, I'm not in college yet, I'm just a senior in high school.
[01:46:48.174 --> 01:46:51.336]  I'm saying, how will colleges do in this financial time?
[01:46:52.294 --> 01:46:52.545]  Hello.
[01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:57.728]  If things go to hell, pardon my French, will I even be able to finish my degree, do you think?
[01:46:57.728 --> 01:47:09.334]  Well, what's going to happen is in four or five years or even sooner, they're going to be forced to end this bubble, you know, where they're charging $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year to go to mediocre colleges.
[01:47:09.334 --> 01:47:19.800]  And the fact is that the degree you're going to get for a long time, you're not going to probably be able to even get a job that will even come close to being able to pay off the debts associated with that.
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.761]  And people are doing the math and figuring this out.
[01:47:22.901 --> 01:47:43.489]  I personally was going to college but I started my access TV show and I was a sophomore in college and boom I had a radio job a few months later and so I just quit college because I didn't have time to continue what I was doing starting to make films and doing a radio show and doing a local TV show so I took the opportunity.
[01:47:43.489 --> 01:47:44.850]  There are certainly opportunities
[01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:46.031]  We're good to go.
[01:47:56.397 --> 01:47:57.458]  I mean, I've seen the studies.
[01:47:57.458 --> 01:48:05.766]  There's really not much of a future to make any real money that could even come close to paying off your debts.
[01:48:05.766 --> 01:48:14.233]  But the good news is, because the economy is coming back to reality, the colleges are going to be forced, and it's already happening, to lower tuitions.
[01:48:14.233 --> 01:48:16.736]  And so that's in a process right now.
[01:48:16.736 --> 01:48:18.537]  But that's a very complex question.
[01:48:19.727 --> 01:48:40.373]  That's a decision you've got to make for yourself, but I'll tell you this, sir, if you just want to make money, even in this bad economy, going and getting a truck and lawnmowers and hiring a crew and going out and mowing yards every day or doing landscaping or starting hot dog stands.
[01:48:40.373 --> 01:48:43.594]  Look, Bill Gates quit college, Rush Limbaugh didn't go to college.
[01:48:45.134 --> 01:48:47.155]  And they've done studies on this.
[01:48:47.155 --> 01:48:59.780]  Most really successful executives and most really successful entrepreneurs didn't go to college or quit college because they were go-getters and they were already successful before they went through the college process.
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:09.044]  College is kind of a place to warehouse people for four to eight more years so they don't go into the workforce and saddle them with debt.
[01:49:09.044 --> 01:49:12.965]  And that's an over-generality and I'm not attacking college itself.
[01:49:12.965 --> 01:49:13.506]  It's just that
[01:49:16.906 --> 01:49:19.507]  I mean, it depends on what you want to do in life.
[01:49:19.507 --> 01:49:23.007]  What professions are you allured by?
[01:49:23.007 --> 01:49:35.350]  Well, I was accepted for astrophysics, and that's all well and good to me, but it seems to me that they've covered up the real science, what was like Pat Youngfield and everything that I'm finding on the internet.
[01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:41.471]  So you were accepted for the physics of space travel and stuff like that?
[01:49:41.471 --> 01:49:41.671]  Yeah.
[01:49:44.262 --> 01:49:49.565]  Well, I mean, if you're extremely gifted in that area, there'll probably be university and research jobs.
[01:49:49.565 --> 01:49:59.832]  I mean, you want to work for the government, about 90% of most of that type of research is black-op budget, secret programs, or you'll be doing research to then give it to the globalists.
[01:49:59.832 --> 01:50:12.381]  But no, that's where college really is needed, is in the real scientific fields, in biology, in electrical engineering, structural engineering, mathematics and things like that.
[01:50:13.361 --> 01:50:23.348]  So I think college would probably be good for you, and you're going to need that in that genre of work.
[01:50:23.348 --> 01:50:26.850]  So for folks on the scientific field, college is a must, pretty much.
[01:50:26.850 --> 01:50:29.351]  Okay, great.
[01:50:29.351 --> 01:50:35.235]  Well, I've been listening to you and Jason, and what I'd really like to do is just get out there and tell people about this stuff.
[01:50:36.297 --> 01:50:38.859]  Maybe I could have a radio station at the college or something like that.
[01:50:38.859 --> 01:50:39.559]  Who knows?
[01:50:39.559 --> 01:50:40.219]  Absolutely!
[01:50:40.219 --> 01:50:45.342]  You know, have your major be science and your minor be RTF.
[01:50:45.342 --> 01:50:46.603]  And, uh, you know, whatever.
[01:50:46.603 --> 01:50:49.865]  And then separately, while you're going to school, start your own blog.
[01:50:49.865 --> 01:50:51.346]  Start your own internet radio show.
[01:50:51.346 --> 01:50:52.307]  Don't wait.
[01:50:52.307 --> 01:50:55.769]  You know, do lots of things.
[01:50:55.769 --> 01:50:57.170]  A well-rounded life.
[01:50:57.170 --> 01:50:58.290]  We need generalists.
[01:50:58.290 --> 01:50:59.551]  People that know a lot of things.
[01:50:59.551 --> 01:51:00.972]  Not these specialists.
[01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:06.979]  In these uncertain times, safety and precaution are key.
[01:51:06.979 --> 01:51:08.563]  Don't rely on others for protection.
[01:51:08.996 --> 01:51:12.598]  Protect yourself and your family with products from Pepperspray.com.
[01:51:12.598 --> 01:51:17.961]  Pepperspray.com carries the largest assortment of pepper spray and personal safety devices on the web.
[01:51:17.961 --> 01:51:21.703]  From home safety to nighttime safety we have the products you need.
[01:51:21.703 --> 01:51:32.269]  Order the Discreet Pepper Mace Baton, which relies on a powerful pepper formula that upon direct contact with an attacker's eyes, forces them to slam shut, causing an intense burning sensation.
[01:51:32.269 --> 01:51:35.391]  This refillable unit is designed to be carried as a key ring.
[01:51:35.391 --> 01:51:36.732]  Easily accessible pepper spray
[01:51:36.732 --> 01:51:38.233]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:52:05.183 --> 01:52:08.025]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:08.025 --> 01:52:13.889]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.889 --> 01:52:20.394]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.394 --> 01:52:22.375]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.375 --> 01:52:24.837]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.837 --> 01:52:34.584]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[01:52:35.024 --> 01:52:38.007]  That's fascist.
[01:52:38.007 --> 01:52:39.668]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.668 --> 01:52:41.549]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:41.549 --> 01:52:48.455]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:48.455 --> 01:52:56.722]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.722 --> 01:52:58.283]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:58.283 --> 01:52:59.484]  The people strike back.
[01:53:01.252 --> 01:53:04.755]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:53:04.755 --> 01:53:09.298]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:53:09.298 --> 01:53:17.164]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:53:17.489 --> 01:53:20.611]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:53:20.611 --> 01:53:28.236]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:53:28.236 --> 01:53:33.819]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:53:34.059 --> 01:53:39.883]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:53:39.883 --> 01:53:43.445]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:53:43.445 --> 01:53:47.027]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:53:47.027 --> 01:53:52.110]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief Superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:53:52.110 --> 01:53:54.992]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:53:54.992 --> 01:53:55.192]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:54:30.664 --> 01:54:34.466]  We are now simulcasting the live radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:34.466 --> 01:54:35.166]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:35.166 --> 01:54:39.868]  The Obama Deception is now here in DVD and shipping out to everybody that's gotten it.
[01:54:39.868 --> 01:54:42.470]  Get your copy at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:44.346 --> 01:54:54.850]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls, and coming up for the next 10-15 minutes of the first hour, I'll be simulcasting with Judge Andrew Napolitano's radio slash TV show, so that is coming up.
[01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:58.011]  Right now, let's go to Roland Enmasse.
[01:54:58.011 --> 01:55:00.271]  Roland, you're on the air.
[01:55:00.271 --> 01:55:00.992]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:00.992 --> 01:55:04.893]  Alex, it's a great pleasure and honor to be with you.
[01:55:04.893 --> 01:55:05.833]  Let's see here.
[01:55:05.833 --> 01:55:07.854]  I had a couple quick questions.
[01:55:07.854 --> 01:55:13.216]  One of the members of our group that we organize here was talking about Peter Schiff and the Schiff family being
[01:55:14.383 --> 01:55:17.144]  Funders of the Bolshevik Revolution?
[01:55:17.144 --> 01:55:18.405]  Or one of the funders?
[01:55:18.405 --> 01:55:22.626]  I mean, yeah, there's probably tens of thousands of shifts in the United States.
[01:55:22.626 --> 01:55:25.607]  It's like saying, am I related to John Paul Jones?
[01:55:25.607 --> 01:55:31.089]  I don't believe I am the first Navy admiral in the Revolutionary War.
[01:55:31.089 --> 01:55:33.390]  Or am I related to Jim Jones?
[01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:34.750]  The answer is no.
[01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:38.792]  But am I guilty because of something Jim Jones has done somewhere back in Wales?
[01:55:39.552 --> 01:55:41.433]  Did I have somebody related to Jim Jones?
[01:55:41.433 --> 01:55:43.915]  Probably 50th Cousins or 100th Cousins.
[01:55:43.915 --> 01:55:44.195]  I don't know.
[01:55:44.195 --> 01:55:46.276]  I'm probably related to John Paul Jones as well.
[01:55:46.276 --> 01:55:55.862]  I'm probably related to James Jones, one of the heads of Homeland Security, setting up the police state of the National Security Council.
[01:55:55.862 --> 01:56:03.427]  But no, Erwin Schiff, the father of Peter Schiff, is in prison for exposing the private Federal Reserve.
[01:56:03.427 --> 01:56:07.150]  Anybody who's prominent fighting the New World Order gets attacked by the government and the media.
[01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:13.397]  But they also get attacked just by crazies that are jealous of anybody who has any success on the internet.
[01:56:13.397 --> 01:56:15.920]  They just make up new things constantly.
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:17.421]  That's what I thought.
[01:56:17.421 --> 01:56:22.527]  As far as my own research goes, everything Peter has ever said seems pretty consistent.
[01:56:22.527 --> 01:56:25.030]  He's giving financial news, take it or leave it.
[01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:26.973]  He's just another person out there talking.
[01:56:28.494 --> 01:56:31.816]  I mean, it's all this obsession about who's talking about the New World Order.
[01:56:31.816 --> 01:56:33.457]  They're openly setting up world government.
[01:56:33.457 --> 01:56:35.258]  It's all over the newspapers.
[01:56:35.258 --> 01:56:38.580]  And most of our movement spends their time just attacking everybody else.
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:40.361]  And it's jealousy.
[01:56:40.361 --> 01:56:40.781]  It's envy.
[01:56:40.781 --> 01:56:42.322]  I'd love to say they were government agents.
[01:56:42.322 --> 01:56:43.262]  They're not government agents.
[01:56:43.262 --> 01:56:44.143]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:44.143 --> 01:56:46.884]  I mean, that's not what this show is about.
[01:56:46.884 --> 01:56:47.985]  Is this guy good?
[01:56:47.985 --> 01:56:48.945]  Or is that guy good?
[01:56:48.945 --> 01:56:49.886]  Or is this lady good?
[01:56:50.979 --> 01:56:53.660]  We're just here covering the news and information.
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:57:04.383]  You know, I told you last week that they had Marines, Army, excuse me, out running around with checkpoints after the Alabama shooting and we called up and had the colonel on who was there and he admitted they were and now it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:57:06.644 --> 01:57:10.146]  Reviews troop use at fatal Alabama shootings.
[01:57:10.146 --> 01:57:16.068]  Here's CNS News, Army investigating how and why troops were sent into Alabama town after murder spree.
[01:57:16.068 --> 01:57:21.470]  And they have the Army here saying it looks like it's illegal what they did, carrying out law enforcement activities.
[01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:28.713]  The colonel said it wasn't law enforcement activities, but it clearly was, controlling cordon and running checkpoints, running roadblocks.
[01:57:30.334 --> 01:57:40.336]  The military's trying to get rid of Posse Comintonis right now, but it's kind of interesting that they've announced they're going to put 20,000 regular troops on the streets, but now they're saying these guys may be in trouble.
[01:57:40.336 --> 01:57:47.677]  It looks like they're in trouble because they exceeded their orders and we're out here doing this on their own, and I don't think they should get in trouble for this.
[01:57:47.677 --> 01:57:54.298]  They just need to say they're not going to do it again because they've been told by the brass we're going to start policing America.
[01:57:54.298 --> 01:57:57.159]  That's been in the news, been in the Army Times, and so then
[01:57:58.439 --> 01:58:04.545]  There's a shooting, they try to show up to help thinking this is their orders, and now they may get in trouble.
[01:58:04.545 --> 01:58:13.415]  It's because the illusion of that order has been given, and they see troops at the Super Bowl and troops on the TV in New York, so they think this is normal.
[01:58:13.415 --> 01:58:16.138]  Now they're learning their lesson, this is a federal crime.
[01:58:16.138 --> 01:58:19.701]  This is a violation of federal law.
[01:58:19.701 --> 01:58:20.522]  I appreciate...
[01:58:23.052 --> 01:58:23.813]  Everybody's call.
[01:58:23.813 --> 01:58:29.758]  We've got to go to break here and start the next hour already into the third hour today.
[01:58:29.758 --> 01:58:32.160]  Simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:39.205]  When we come back for stations out there, I'm just throwing it to Andrew Napolitano, Judge Napolitano's show, till he comes to me.
[01:58:39.205 --> 01:58:39.666]  Stay with us.

[01:58:57.578 --> 01:59:00.539]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.

[01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:08.302]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.482 --> 01:59:08.762]  We're good.

[01:59:56.366 --> 02:00:05.648]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.648 --> 02:00:06.948]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.948 --> 02:00:08.729]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.729 --> 02:00:10.469]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:12.069]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:13.010]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:17.811]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.811 --> 02:00:21.872]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:32.906]  Okay, we're gonna be simulcasting here in just a minute or so with Andrew Napolitano's show, Judge Napolitano.
[02:00:32.906 --> 02:00:37.691]  I'm gonna go ahead and throw up the Fox audio right now from their show and wait till he goes to me.
[02:00:37.691 --> 02:00:39.592]  I'm gonna let him run the show here.
[02:00:39.592 --> 02:00:39.913]  Here we go.
[02:00:48.012 --> 02:00:51.236]  Okay, well we're waiting for my guys to send me that.
[02:00:51.236 --> 02:00:53.478]  I'm not going to it for about ten minutes.
[02:00:53.478 --> 02:00:53.979]  Okay, great.
[02:00:53.979 --> 02:00:54.900]  We've got audio now.
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:56.682]  I'm just going to wait for Fox.
[02:00:56.682 --> 02:01:03.709]  Fox, I'm here and I'm just running the judges show right now as you guys get ready to go live there as well.
[02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:04.710]  My face is at an angle.
[02:01:11.154 --> 02:01:14.216]  Hey, change the aspect ratio, please, on the remote.
[02:01:14.216 --> 02:01:18.619]  Ha, this is a rare trait.
[02:01:18.619 --> 02:01:30.207]  He looks a little squeezed.
[02:01:30.207 --> 02:01:34.810]  That's pretty good, though, considering Skype, my god, it's excellent.
[02:01:34.810 --> 02:01:38.613]  It's a lot better than those things Carl Cameron did from the car during the campaign.
[02:01:40.506 --> 02:01:42.228]  Yeah, that's different technology.
[02:01:42.228 --> 02:01:42.629]  Hello?
[02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:45.754]  I suppose one day you'll give us Skypes on our desks?
[02:01:45.754 --> 02:01:48.658]  No, we're not allowed to have it internally.
[02:01:48.658 --> 02:01:49.279]  Well, that stinks.
[02:01:49.279 --> 02:01:50.200]  Hello, Alex?
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:51.141]  I can understand it, though.
[02:01:51.141 --> 02:01:52.383]  They want us in a studio, yeah.
[02:01:52.383 --> 02:01:53.104]  It's a security risk.
[02:01:53.104 --> 02:01:54.807]  Understood, understood, and I respect that.
[02:01:54.807 --> 02:01:55.167]  Hello, Alex?
[02:01:57.156 --> 02:01:58.697]  I'm here guys, I'm waiting.
[02:01:58.697 --> 02:02:02.339]  Okay, we're going to put in a program and the judge will bring you in, okay?
[02:02:02.339 --> 02:02:08.903]  Okay, yeah, you're sending me your regular audio feed over, just so you know, but I can hear you, I'm ready, when they go to me, I'm here.
[02:02:08.903 --> 02:02:10.264]  I wonder if they could do it.
[02:02:10.264 --> 02:02:16.648]  Hey guys, can you... Joel, Uma... Andy will be with you shortly.
[02:02:16.648 --> 02:02:18.490]  Okay, I'm here, thank you.
[02:02:18.490 --> 02:02:19.670]  Andy will be with you shortly.
[02:02:29.517 --> 02:02:31.119]  Great human being.
[02:02:31.119 --> 02:02:31.739]  Great human being.
[02:02:59.206 --> 02:03:00.727]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:00.727 --> 02:03:01.787]  It's 11 o'clock in the morning.

[02:03:05.049 --> 02:03:06.829]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:06.829 --> 02:03:07.810]  It's 11 o'clock in the morning.
[02:03:07.810 --> 02:03:10.391]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:10.391 --> 02:03:11.491]  It's 11 o'clock in the morning.
[02:03:11.491 --> 02:03:14.052]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:14.052 --> 02:03:15.913]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:15.913 --> 02:03:17.514]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:17.514 --> 02:03:19.395]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:19.395 --> 02:03:21.536]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:21.536 --> 02:03:22.996]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:22.996 --> 02:03:25.297]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:25.297 --> 02:03:27.158]  It's 2 o'clock in the East Coast in New York City.
[02:03:27.158 --> 02:03:27.338]  It's 2 o
[02:03:29.392 --> 02:03:33.935]  Alex, as you welcome me to Alex Jones Radio, I welcome you to Freedom Watch.
[02:03:33.935 --> 02:03:36.197]  Well, Judge, I'm going to let you run the show.
[02:03:36.197 --> 02:03:39.179]  I'm just here to be interviewed by you, and I appreciate you having me on.
[02:03:39.179 --> 02:03:42.462]  We'll get it taken care of.
[02:03:42.462 --> 02:03:46.705]  Can you hear us, Alex?
[02:03:46.705 --> 02:03:48.686]  Yes, we're doing something experimental here.
[02:03:48.686 --> 02:03:50.287]  Yes, Houston.
[02:03:50.287 --> 02:03:52.169]  Cape Canaveral hears you.
[02:03:52.169 --> 02:03:54.150]  Okay, New York hears you loud and clear.
[02:03:54.150 --> 02:03:55.491]  Welcome to Freedom Watch, Alex.
[02:03:55.491 --> 02:03:56.792]  What are you talking about today?
[02:03:57.757 --> 02:04:10.172]  Oh, just how hundreds of mainstream news articles a week are saying there is a new world order, a global government, it will be run by the very banks that are collapsing society by design, and we will pay carbon taxes to them.
[02:04:10.172 --> 02:04:15.919]  Here is Time Magazine headlined, New World Order, and they say a new bank of the world will rule the United States.
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:21.621]  Here is the Financial Times of London, and now for a world government is the headline.
[02:04:21.621 --> 02:04:27.763]  They're openly announcing that the banks will rule the planet and will pay our carbon taxes to them for the phony global warming.
[02:04:27.763 --> 02:04:40.926]  And I just had a state rep on confirming the modern militia movement document, MYAC, saying Ron Paul supporters, libertarians, anybody with a Ron Paul bumper sticker are dangerous terrorists, that the North American Union doesn't exist,
[02:04:41.526 --> 02:04:47.208]  That anybody that talks about freedom or liberty issues is basically an evil terrorist.
[02:04:47.208 --> 02:04:50.188]  So we're exposing the New World Order here, Judge.
[02:04:50.188 --> 02:04:51.749]  I appreciate what you're exposing.
[02:04:51.749 --> 02:04:57.470]  And Ron Paul, whom you just mentioned, will be on Freedom Watch with me in about 20 minutes.
[02:04:57.470 --> 02:05:05.333]  I must tell you that there was a time when the types of things that you were warning against was not discussed openly and publicly.
[02:05:05.333 --> 02:05:10.654]  But I was scandalized when British Prime Minister Gordon Brown tipped his hand
[02:05:11.385 --> 02:05:26.797]  When he spoke to a joint session of Congress two weeks ago and said he was looking for, these are the words that caused me a couple of sleepless nights, Alex, and I bet you as well and many of the folks watching and listening to us, a global new deal.
[02:05:26.797 --> 02:05:34.223]  Now, what under the sun is a global new deal unless it consists of the type of thing that you have just warned against?
[02:05:34.653 --> 02:05:35.073]  We're good to go.
[02:05:48.152 --> 02:05:48.793]  Absolutely.
[02:05:48.793 --> 02:05:51.055]  Here is yesterday's London Telegraph.
[02:05:51.055 --> 02:06:08.792]  IMS poised to print billions of dollars in global easing and it says that the International Monetary Fund will create a new global super currency that will replace the dollar and that Americans will pay tax money in to fund the world government.
[02:06:08.792 --> 02:06:11.594]  So this is all out in the open.
[02:06:11.594 --> 02:06:11.875]  That's why
[02:06:12.415 --> 02:06:14.798]  On our news, Geithner will never say what the plan is.
[02:06:14.798 --> 02:06:15.378]  What are you going to do?
[02:06:15.378 --> 02:06:16.459]  How are you going to fix it?
[02:06:16.459 --> 02:06:25.228]  But when the G20 meet, when they have the Bretton Woods meeting, the new one coming up in a few days, they admit they're setting up a world government run by private banks.
[02:06:25.228 --> 02:06:27.631]  What the Trilateral Commission said back in the 70s.
[02:06:27.631 --> 02:06:28.312]  Listen, I never...
[02:06:28.792 --> 02:06:29.813]  You know, discovered any of this.
[02:06:29.813 --> 02:06:31.574]  This was never my opinion.
[02:06:31.574 --> 02:06:33.175]  And people are saying, how were you right about all this?
[02:06:33.175 --> 02:06:35.096]  How did you know this 14 years ago?
[02:06:35.096 --> 02:06:55.148]  I was reading IMF, World Bank, United Nations, Rand Corporation, Council on Foreign Relations documents, where they said, and the SPP documents that Judicial Watch sued and got a few years ago, they were going to use a financial meltdown to bring in the North American Union, the new transatlantic agreement to merge that with the European Union.
[02:06:55.148 --> 02:06:58.250]  We are already deep into this merger and it's all over the
[02:06:59.351 --> 02:07:06.455]  Let me raise your blood pressure a little bit more, Alex, because this is also what I'm now about to discuss with you raised my blood pressure.
[02:07:06.455 --> 02:07:22.844]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited her counterpart in Beijing about eight or nine days ago, and I don't know who else she saw, but we saw pictures of her with the Chinese foreign minister about four days after that at the G20 summit to which you just referred.
[02:07:23.408 --> 02:07:33.094]  A meeting of the finance ministers of the 20 largest countries in the world, which control collectively about 85% of the economy.
[02:07:33.094 --> 02:07:36.277]  For some reason, the Chinese premier was there.
[02:07:36.277 --> 02:07:40.780]  He was the only head of state there, other than Gordon Brown as the host.
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:50.526]  And the Chinese premier, before the G20 started, gave an interview to one of the international press and said he seriously worried
[02:07:51.049 --> 02:07:51.209]  Yes.
[02:08:03.544 --> 02:08:04.285]  I think so.
[02:08:21.598 --> 02:08:28.881]  Well, we know in separate meetings she's had with the Chinese leadership in several trips in Europe and in China, she said, please keep buying the dollar.
[02:08:28.881 --> 02:08:31.323]  Please keep buying our debt.
[02:08:31.323 --> 02:08:35.044]  Just long enough for us to set up this new global monetary system.
[02:08:35.044 --> 02:08:38.086]  The Russians are calling for a new global currency.
[02:08:38.086 --> 02:08:40.847]  The only thing the US has left is its fiat dollar.
[02:08:40.847 --> 02:08:41.988]  The globalists have debased
[02:08:42.868 --> 02:08:43.629]  Our nation.
[02:08:43.629 --> 02:08:45.150]  They've made us a debtor nation.
[02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:48.753]  They've destroyed our capacity to manufacture.
[02:08:48.753 --> 02:08:52.036]  And so the globalists are creating a global fire sale.
[02:08:52.036 --> 02:09:05.287]  They're destroying the world economy in their own documents so that then they'll be the only lender to the planet and they'll create more fiat currency backed by US and European taxpayers to then fund setting up their world government.
[02:09:05.287 --> 02:09:07.829]  So absolutely the Chinese have been bad-mouthing the US.
[02:09:08.289 --> 02:09:14.234]  Now, they've been bad-mouthing the country that they own over a trillion dollars of our T-bills in.
[02:09:14.234 --> 02:09:25.202]  This is the birth of the New World Order, and so you've got all these different honchos from the private central banks, the private Federal Reserve, and others, all meeting, deciding on the final architecture of the world government.
[02:09:25.202 --> 02:09:31.547]  The very banks that have engineered the economic collapse are now posing as our saviors, bringing this in.
[02:09:31.547 --> 02:09:32.608]  But the good news is,
[02:09:33.408 --> 02:09:35.389]  I've never seen an awakening this big.
[02:09:35.389 --> 02:09:38.450]  And I'm seeing, you know, people like Glenn Beck talk about the New World Order on Fox.
[02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:40.231]  I'm seeing you talk about it for years.
[02:09:40.231 --> 02:09:42.792]  Before him, we're seeing Lou Dobbs talk about it.
[02:09:42.792 --> 02:09:47.914]  We're seeing, you know, mainline talk show host Limbaugh's even talking about global government now.
[02:09:47.914 --> 02:09:53.597]  Michael Savage is talking about how he thinks, you know, Obama may stage crises to bring in martial law.
[02:09:53.597 --> 02:10:00.220]  So, all the things that I was talking about in the wilderness ten plus years ago is now hitting mainstream.
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:06.062]  And it is great, so it shows me the sleeping giant that is the United States and all of this liberty and freedom.
[02:10:06.062 --> 02:10:10.223]  We're rediscovering our roots, our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution.
[02:10:10.223 --> 02:10:15.045]  You called for states to not secede, but, you know, re-declare their Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment.
[02:10:15.045 --> 02:10:20.727]  You're a judge, you know the Constitution well, constitutional scholar, and so they're trying to get the feds back in line.
[02:10:20.727 --> 02:10:27.169]  The battle lines are being drawn here, and the American people are finding out that Washington's been seized by offshore banks.
[02:10:28.393 --> 02:10:33.517]  Well, this will make your blood boil a little bit more as we keep ratcheting this up.
[02:10:33.517 --> 02:10:36.439]  And I thought that the summary you just gave was terrific.
[02:10:36.439 --> 02:10:46.207]  And just for those of us that are tuning in, Judge Napolitano simulcasting from Freedom Watch at FoxNews.com with Alex Jones, the great Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[02:10:46.207 --> 02:10:47.969]  We only have another minute or so.
[02:10:47.969 --> 02:10:55.815]  I suspect that Mrs. Clinton and the President will begin saying nice things about the Chinese human rights record.
[02:10:56.226 --> 02:10:57.227]  No, no, they are now.
[02:10:57.227 --> 02:11:00.631]  They are and that's why we've made the Obama deception.
[02:11:00.631 --> 02:11:13.045]  Because if we dare to criticize, if we dare to use our First Amendment rights against one of the most oppressive giants in the world, they might just stop loaning us money, Alex.
[02:11:13.045 --> 02:11:13.626]  What would we do?
[02:11:14.946 --> 02:11:17.567]  Well, things would basically collapse, and that's what the globalists want.
[02:11:17.567 --> 02:11:27.969]  We're all interconnected and controlled, and that's what my new film, The Obama Deception, at InfoWars.com covers, is how this guy is controlled by the very banks that did the bailout.
[02:11:27.969 --> 02:11:29.329]  Geithner helped write it.
[02:11:29.329 --> 02:11:35.651]  He's claiming he's going after all these CEOs' bonuses when they wrote a loophole in there where they're all exempt
[02:11:35.871 --> 02:11:36.751]  We're good.
[02:11:57.657 --> 02:12:02.239]  what his agenda is to bankrupt this country and bring in total police state control.
[02:12:02.239 --> 02:12:04.460]  But again, the good news is, the people are waking up.
[02:12:04.460 --> 02:12:07.341]  And by the way, the Obama Deception is free on YouTube and Google.
[02:12:07.341 --> 02:12:09.762]  Folks, don't have to get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:12:09.762 --> 02:12:15.584]  The Obama Deception, the most hard-hitting film, shattering the left-right paradigm, blowing the New World Order apart.
[02:12:15.584 --> 02:12:21.367]  Judge Napolitano, I want to thank you so much for having this simulcast, and I want to invite you on my show anytime, my friend.
[02:12:22.437 --> 02:12:23.358]  Same from me to thee.
[02:12:23.358 --> 02:12:24.299]  Thanks, Alex Jones.
[02:12:24.299 --> 02:12:25.960]  It's absolutely been a pleasure.
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:27.521]  Thank you.
[02:12:27.521 --> 02:12:31.845]  First time with our experimentation with simulcasting two shows.
[02:12:31.845 --> 02:12:36.548]  And before we get to our guests here in Freedom Watch who have joined us and are ready to weigh in.
[02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:46.596]  Thomas Jefferson wedded the natural law to American law in the Declaration of Independence when he wrote that our rights are inalienable and come to us from our Creator.
[02:12:46.596 --> 02:12:48.818]  Not only does federal law... Alright, thank you, Fox.
[02:12:50.128 --> 02:12:53.390]  You guys are getting radical having me on over there.
[02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:54.490]  Let's go ahead and disconnect them.
[02:12:54.490 --> 02:12:57.712]  Thank you, guys.
[02:12:57.712 --> 02:12:59.212]  Alright, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:59.212 --> 02:13:06.756]  That was the simulcast with Judge Napolitano for about 12 minutes.
[02:13:06.756 --> 02:13:08.197]  I said I was going to air this.
[02:13:08.197 --> 02:13:08.857]  I'm going to air it.
[02:13:08.857 --> 02:13:13.219]  Then we're going to come back and take calls with everybody that's patiently holding.
[02:13:13.219 --> 02:13:14.820]  Got a nice plug-in for the Obama deception.
[02:13:17.597 --> 02:13:27.999]  I always told you folks that we would just plant the seeds, tell people the New World Order plan, tell them how the banks were going to implode things, exactly how it would happen, and then when it did happen, people could laugh at me.
[02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:41.462]  I mean, I've had people laugh at me, talk show hosts attack me, I've been booed, you know, when the Obamanoids attacked our bullhorn and cut it with a knife in Denver, they laughed with pleasure as I walked away to go get another bullhorn, and I didn't feel bad.
[02:13:41.462 --> 02:13:46.163]  It felt good to be laughed at, it felt good to be pilloried, it felt good to be attacked, because I knew I was right.
[02:13:47.024 --> 02:13:48.648]  And it's about being right.
[02:13:48.648 --> 02:13:51.435]  It's about standing up for what's good, what's decent, what's honorable.
[02:13:51.435 --> 02:13:53.501]  That's all that matters at the end of the day.
[02:13:55.635 --> 02:14:17.285]  Is that my family name be defended, that I be a good person, that when my great-great-grandchildren see a picture of me on the wall, you know, when they're out there orbiting the planet on a space station or terraforming Mars or living right here in Texas, you know, wherever they are in the future, that they respect and remember me and then use me as an example of being strong men and women and standing up for goodness and humanity and honorable things.
[02:14:17.285 --> 02:14:22.188]  And so they believe in their humanity and believe in the change that they can make in the world for good.
[02:14:23.666 --> 02:14:37.758]  Just like I look back at my forbearers, you know, who were at the Battle of San Jacinto, and my forbearers who raised Colonel Travis's son when he went to the Alamo, and my forbearers that came over on the Mayflower, and my forbearers who were Native Americans and great, upstanding, amazing people.
[02:14:37.758 --> 02:14:51.910]  And I look at that, and I don't want to short sell, you know, my lineage, who I am as a human being, and all of us are special, all of us had just amazing people that busted their hind ends and fought and died in many cases, so we'd have a little bit of dignity and freedom.
[02:14:53.444 --> 02:14:56.966]  Now, I promised to play this conversation with Sergeant Joe Clark of MIAC.
[02:14:56.966 --> 02:14:59.687]  We are not terrorists.
[02:14:59.687 --> 02:15:01.448]  And here is that YouTube.
[02:15:01.448 --> 02:15:02.688]  Great reporters did this report.
[02:15:02.688 --> 02:15:05.990]  So I'm going to go ahead and play this report here video-wise.
[02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:07.470]  In fact, I forgot to give this to you.
[02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:10.192]  The network has the audio of this.
[02:15:11.226 --> 02:15:20.653]  But instead of the network, since we're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv, I'm still getting used to this, will you guys come get this, YouTube it, pull it up, that way folks can also see the fine reporters that did this.
[02:15:20.653 --> 02:15:23.655]  You know, we didn't call up and take the state police.
[02:15:23.655 --> 02:15:27.578]  And we gave you their names and phone numbers when we put out the Mike report and people still denied it.
[02:15:27.578 --> 02:15:32.521]  And we had a state rep on last hour documenting that he indeed
[02:15:33.803 --> 02:15:39.768]  Uh, called the state police, has the head of the state police coming over to his office next week when the legislature's back in session.
[02:15:39.768 --> 02:15:42.291]  So you heard Jim Guess, Representative, tell you it's real.
[02:15:42.291 --> 02:15:48.957]  But I thought I'd play this tape as well, going into break and then coming out of break about a minute or so, uh, of it will be left, but...
[02:15:50.635 --> 02:16:05.748]  Again, what's happened here is we laid out, no matter how much we got laughed at, no matter how many times I got fired, no matter how many stations we lost, no matter, you know, how much monetary damage it caused to my small operation, I never wavered.
[02:16:05.748 --> 02:16:17.377]  And I remember I saw other people, and I'm not bashing them, started a Ron Paul network, a little Ron Paul thing during that, and they said, oh, no New World Order, no 9-11 truth, none of this, because this is how we're going to be big, and this is how we're going to have a huge success.
[02:16:17.377 --> 02:16:19.019]  And I remember saying, you know,
[02:16:20.316 --> 02:16:24.822]  Imagine if you were offered real power, how fast you would sell out.
[02:16:24.822 --> 02:16:34.374]  Imagine if you were offered real power, like I have been, millions of dollars a year, power, real power, all over the country, on hundreds and hundreds of AM and FM's, and I've turned it down repeatedly.
[02:16:35.376 --> 02:16:40.879]  And I haven't seen many other people who will turn down hard, cold cash.
[02:16:40.879 --> 02:16:44.501]  I haven't seen other people that will turn down hard, cold fame.
[02:16:44.501 --> 02:16:45.982]  And I don't understand that.
[02:16:45.982 --> 02:16:55.508]  Who I am, being accurate, being honest, telling it like it is, and doing it my way, is numero uno.
[02:16:55.508 --> 02:16:56.849]  Period.
[02:16:56.849 --> 02:16:58.770]  And that's why I do what I do.
[02:16:58.770 --> 02:17:00.311]  And I'm not bashing people
[02:17:01.912 --> 02:17:08.881]  I mean, they started several Ron Paul, you know, radio networks I've seen in the last year that went the way of the Goonie Bird because it was controlled.
[02:17:08.881 --> 02:17:11.043]  It was censored.
[02:17:11.043 --> 02:17:12.605]  We don't do that here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:12.605 --> 02:17:16.970]  I tell it like it is, and I tell it as the best of my ability to understand it.
[02:17:16.970 --> 02:17:18.012]  Does that mean I'm perfect?
[02:17:18.012 --> 02:17:19.213]  No, we all see through.
[02:17:20.154 --> 02:17:21.455]  A rose colored darkly.
[02:17:21.455 --> 02:17:24.117]  We all see the world distorted from what it really is.
[02:17:24.117 --> 02:17:28.781]  But I've always tried to train myself to extricate myself from emotion.
[02:17:28.781 --> 02:17:31.964]  Now, I coldly analyze and I get emotional on air.
[02:17:31.964 --> 02:17:32.564]  That's my nature.
[02:17:32.564 --> 02:17:39.170]  But I coldly analyze, make the decision of what the proper course is to take and I do it.
[02:17:39.972 --> 02:17:40.853]  I'd do it.
[02:17:40.853 --> 02:17:54.944]  And we've just had unbelievable success, and it's like somebody lit a rocket off underneath us, because we are just... I mean, it is bracing, it is staggering to realize we are reaching millions of new people a week, folks.
[02:17:54.944 --> 02:17:57.666]  We are not preaching to the choir, but I love the choir.
[02:17:57.666 --> 02:17:59.068]  You're the people that have spread the word.
[02:17:59.068 --> 02:18:01.750]  You're the people that found out before others about the New World Order.
[02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:06.654]  You're the people that went up against the propaganda and went up against being pilloried and attacked, just like I did.
[02:18:07.074 --> 02:18:12.363]  You have experienced the ostracization, being laughed at, being ridiculed, being fired, being restricted.
[02:18:12.363 --> 02:18:16.349]  I've probably talked to five, six, seven more people at Dell Computer.
[02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:17.531]  They're allowed to surf during lunch.
[02:18:17.531 --> 02:18:19.094]  You surf to InfoWars, you're fired.
[02:18:20.387 --> 02:18:24.252]  You know, people have gone through a lot just to check out this information.
[02:18:24.252 --> 02:18:26.754]  That's why the enemy's moving to restrict free speech.
[02:18:26.754 --> 02:18:28.276]  That's why all of this is happening.
[02:18:28.276 --> 02:18:29.157]  Go ahead and punch this up.
[02:18:29.157 --> 02:18:31.480]  We're not going to play yet, but I want folks to see the text here.
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:37.627]  As we go out to break, when we come back, we're going to play Missouri Information Analysis Center phone call to Public Information Officer Sergeant Joe Clark.
[02:18:38.662 --> 02:18:44.904]  Last week regarding, no this is yesterday, regarding the widely discussed training document being circulated on the internet.
[02:18:44.904 --> 02:18:46.265]  This thing only had a few hundred views.
[02:18:46.265 --> 02:18:49.666]  It's going to have tens of thousands now because I want everybody to go to YouTube and watch it.
[02:18:49.666 --> 02:18:55.708]  But we're going to play it when we come back out of this quick break and also give you the title of the video so you can find out.
[02:18:55.708 --> 02:18:59.610]  We're going to post it up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:18:59.610 --> 02:19:02.251]  But I just couldn't believe people last week thought that I was making this up.
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:04.841]  I mean, we got the document.
[02:19:04.841 --> 02:19:06.482]  I've seen many other documents similar to it.
[02:19:06.482 --> 02:19:08.282]  This one was the most out of control and egregious.
[02:19:08.282 --> 02:19:09.983]  You know, this went the furthest.
[02:19:09.983 --> 02:19:10.704]  Ron Paul stickers.
[02:19:10.704 --> 02:19:13.085]  You're a terrorist, basically.
[02:19:13.085 --> 02:19:15.466]  And so we called and confirmed the state police.
[02:19:15.466 --> 02:19:15.946]  It was theirs.
[02:19:15.946 --> 02:19:17.707]  We got it from the state police.
[02:19:17.707 --> 02:19:20.488]  I got a similar one out of another state just last week.
[02:19:20.488 --> 02:19:22.729]  And more of them are coming in now from police and others.
[02:19:22.729 --> 02:19:23.510]  So send them to us.
[02:19:23.510 --> 02:19:24.650]  Mail them to us.
[02:19:24.650 --> 02:19:25.911]  And we will cover it here.
[02:19:25.911 --> 02:19:29.473]  And everything we cover now becomes national news in a week or two.
[02:19:29.473 --> 02:19:30.593]  We are driving the news.
[02:19:30.593 --> 02:19:31.714]  We are forcing the news.
[02:19:32.674 --> 02:19:33.415]  And the issue's out.
[02:19:33.415 --> 02:19:39.661]  We are fire starters of the minds of men that Thomas Jefferson talked about so much.
[02:19:39.661 --> 02:19:42.464]  By the way, the Obama Deception is out on DVD, folks.
[02:19:42.464 --> 02:19:43.885]  Get it at Infowars.com.
[02:19:43.885 --> 02:19:44.986]  Get the hard copy.
[02:19:44.986 --> 02:19:49.430]  You gotta have this in your library and spread the copy that's on the web to the four winds.
[02:19:49.430 --> 02:19:54.115]  We'll be right back with this key report with one of the state police sergeants.
[02:19:54.115 --> 02:19:54.776]  Stay with us.
[02:19:54.776 --> 02:19:55.737]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.310 --> 02:20:08.493]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[02:20:08.493 --> 02:20:14.916]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[02:20:14.916 --> 02:20:20.659]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[02:20:20.659 --> 02:20:22.740]  Starve or surrender.
[02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:27.422]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[02:20:27.422 --> 02:20:28.323]  What then?
[02:20:31.019 --> 02:20:34.100]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:38.442]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[02:20:38.442 --> 02:20:41.303]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[02:20:41.303 --> 02:20:48.525]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.

[02:21:01.784 --> 02:21:07.610]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:14.598]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:21.766]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.766 --> 02:21:23.728]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.728 --> 02:21:26.250]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:26.250 --> 02:21:37.220]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.811 --> 02:21:39.472]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.472 --> 02:21:41.334]  It's about a one world government.
[02:21:41.334 --> 02:21:48.259]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:21:56.525 --> 02:21:58.086]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.086 --> 02:21:59.287]  The people strike back.
[02:22:02.538 --> 02:22:04.880]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:11.125]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[02:23:00.968 --> 02:23:04.670]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[02:23:04.670 --> 02:23:10.413]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[02:23:10.413 --> 02:23:14.755]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[02:23:14.755 --> 02:23:17.217]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[02:23:17.217 --> 02:23:23.140]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:24.020]  We're good to go!
[02:23:52.555 --> 02:23:55.677]  I'm sorry, Sergeant Clark is on the other line right now.
[02:23:55.677 --> 02:24:00.380]  I can have you hold, I can take your name and number and have him give you a call back.
[02:24:00.380 --> 02:24:13.729]  It's kind of whatever you would prefer.
[02:24:22.694 --> 02:24:25.756]  Well, let me hold for a little bit, please.
[02:24:25.756 --> 02:24:26.357]  Okay.
[02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:44.129]  Just a moment.
[02:24:44.129 --> 02:24:45.030]  Six minutes later.
[02:24:48.437 --> 02:24:48.637]  Yes.
[02:24:48.637 --> 02:24:49.358]  Sergeant Clark?
[02:24:49.358 --> 02:24:49.938]  Yes.
[02:24:49.938 --> 02:24:51.079]  Hi, how are you today?
[02:24:51.079 --> 02:24:51.940]  Very good, and yourself?
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:52.360]  Very good.
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:53.201]  Hey, my name is Rob.
[02:24:53.201 --> 02:24:54.842]  I'm with Campaign for Liberty.
[02:24:54.842 --> 02:24:56.884]  I just want to let you know I'm recording this call.
[02:24:56.884 --> 02:24:58.906]  I just would like to ask you a few questions.
[02:24:58.906 --> 02:24:59.326]  Sure.
[02:24:59.326 --> 02:25:01.828]  Trying to clarify.
[02:25:01.828 --> 02:25:09.815]  There's a lot of, as you know, a lot of information circulating on the internet regarding this recent MIAC report that was circulated.
[02:25:09.815 --> 02:25:10.435]  Well, I don't know.
[02:25:10.435 --> 02:25:13.798]  I've not been on the internet to see, but certainly we've taken a bunch of calls.
[02:25:13.798 --> 02:25:15.139]  You're familiar with this report?
[02:25:16.058 --> 02:25:17.221]  Yeah, I'm looking at the report.
[02:25:17.221 --> 02:25:18.905]  If we're talking about the same report.
[02:25:18.905 --> 02:25:19.186]  Okay.
[02:25:19.897 --> 02:25:21.097]  Just a quick question.
[02:25:21.097 --> 02:25:29.199]  There's a lot of concern with people who are members of what some people deem as the Liberty Movement or who are Ron Paul supporters.
[02:25:29.199 --> 02:25:29.899]  Okay.
[02:25:29.899 --> 02:25:33.079]  Members of the Campaign for Liberty, which is a grassroots organization.
[02:25:33.079 --> 02:25:33.439]  Sure.
[02:25:33.439 --> 02:25:47.502]  That was actually very well received recently at CPAC and many of the members of this organization are predominant members in the leading parties and again well received politically on a national level.
[02:25:47.862 --> 02:25:53.964]  And sir, I don't doubt that at all, and I commend you and those folks for everything that they've done.
[02:25:53.964 --> 02:26:13.850]  Okay, I guess the question is, and one of the concerns, why are people that are part of this liberty movement being labeled or targeted or potentially profiled in this report as, really it leads one to believe that this is a list of potential domestic terrorist suspects.
[02:26:14.312 --> 02:26:27.277]  Well, if you read that, I don't see anywhere in that report where it targets anybody, where it profiles anybody, or where it labels anybody of anything as a terrorist or a militia group member or anything like that.
[02:26:27.277 --> 02:26:39.341]  And to think that any law enforcement officer or agency would target somebody for a political affiliation, I think, is inappropriate.
[02:26:39.341 --> 02:26:41.822]  And the report just simply does not say that.
[02:26:42.401 --> 02:26:45.504]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:26:45.504 --> 02:26:56.033]  What is your understanding of why the Constitution Party, Chuck Baldwin, Bob Barr, and Ron Paul, mention of people displaying Ron Paul bumper stickers?
[02:26:56.033 --> 02:26:58.075]  Why is there a mention of that in the report?
[02:26:58.075 --> 02:27:09.725]  Well, if you read the report, I don't think there's a mention of bumper stickers at all anywhere in the eight-page report, so obviously you haven't read the entirety of the report, or you're looking at a report that's
[02:27:11.707 --> 02:27:12.727]  Yeah, hit pause.
[02:27:12.727 --> 02:27:16.569]  I want to comment there and we'll continue back in about 15 seconds.
[02:27:16.569 --> 02:27:23.071]  I love this video because they put little bubbles up with arrows to where it says Ron Paul bumper stickers.
[02:27:23.071 --> 02:27:26.012]  It's the last page.
[02:27:26.012 --> 02:27:28.212]  So, I mean, I'm just getting more and more sick of this.
[02:27:28.212 --> 02:27:33.034]  In fact, I have the original report that everybody's talking about here.
[02:27:33.034 --> 02:27:37.895]  I just showed it on Judge Napolitano's radio and TV show.
[02:27:37.895 --> 02:27:38.595]  I mean, here it is.
[02:27:38.595 --> 02:27:39.536]  This is where it all came from.
[02:27:40.609 --> 02:27:45.772]  Next to last page is Ron Paul right up here with his bumper stickers down here.
[02:27:45.772 --> 02:27:47.073]  Let's go ahead and show folks that again.
[02:27:47.073 --> 02:27:47.993]  Here it is.
[02:27:47.993 --> 02:27:52.776]  Paul, mention of people displaying Ron Paul bumper stickers.
[02:27:52.776 --> 02:27:54.837]  Why is there a mention of that in the report?
[02:27:54.837 --> 02:27:59.699]  Well, if you read the report, I don't think there's a mention of bumper stickers at all anywhere in the 8-page report.
[02:27:59.699 --> 02:28:06.483]  So obviously you haven't read the entirety of the report or you're looking at a report that's
[02:28:07.023 --> 02:28:08.985]  It's been altered or something else.
[02:28:08.985 --> 02:28:19.895]  I can't speak for why you think that there's something in the report that says people who have a Ron Paul bumper sticker or any political affiliation bumper sticker on their car would be targeted.
[02:28:19.895 --> 02:28:23.098]  That's just simply not true and it's not in the report.
[02:28:23.098 --> 02:28:29.524]  Is there a reference to the so-called Patriot Movement or people who are opposed to North American Union or the New World Order in there?
[02:28:31.058 --> 02:28:41.021]  Well, there's some information in there regarding certain militia groups and those violent factions that operate within those militia groups.
[02:28:41.021 --> 02:28:51.904]  It details their certain belief systems and what political parties or candidates they might associate themselves with.
[02:28:51.904 --> 02:28:59.126]  But certainly the document doesn't say that anybody who's affiliated with a certain political candidate or a political party is certainly
[02:29:00.005 --> 02:29:02.926]  A militia member, a terrorist, or anything like that.
[02:29:02.926 --> 02:29:12.009]  He's a militia member or terrorist, as if being in a militia, which is in the Constitution Bill of Rights, is terrorism.
[02:29:12.009 --> 02:29:17.870]  And it's all, these people want to kill you, here's the stickers they have, Ron Paul, Bob Barr, Libertarian Party.
[02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:23.872]  I mean, it says it right there, this is the document, the state police have confirmed, this is the document, it's not been altered.
[02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:26.361]  And it's just unbelievable.
[02:29:26.361 --> 02:29:29.642]  We're going to come back and play a little bit more of this and then go to your phone calls.
[02:29:29.642 --> 02:29:32.484]  Cover a lot of other important, vital news today as well.
[02:29:32.484 --> 02:29:35.185]  The big news is, Israel's saying they may go ahead and hit Iran.
[02:29:35.185 --> 02:29:39.687]  And the Pentagon's saying it looks like that may happen.
[02:29:39.687 --> 02:29:44.810]  They've rattled sabers for a decade before they attacked Iraq, so we're going to be covering that as well.
[02:29:44.810 --> 02:29:51.653]  Stay with us in fullwars.com.
[02:29:51.653 --> 02:29:53.034]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.034 --> 02:29:54.535]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.547 --> 02:30:01.772]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.772 --> 02:30:09.137]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest priced, highest quality, storable food for over a decade.
[02:30:09.137 --> 02:30:13.600]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds four to five people is only $39.95.
[02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:18.444]  That's right, a one-year supply that feeds four to five people for under $4,000.
[02:30:18.444 --> 02:30:18.824]  That's only
[02:30:22.278 --> 02:30:22.779]  I don't know.
[02:30:40.029 --> 02:30:43.030]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:44.051]  We've got to give them a stake.
[02:31:09.821 --> 02:31:14.062]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:14.062 --> 02:31:20.564]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.564 --> 02:31:22.545]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.545 --> 02:31:25.006]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:31:25.006 --> 02:31:35.889]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:38.186 --> 02:31:39.848]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.848 --> 02:31:41.710]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.710 --> 02:31:48.637]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:56.886 --> 02:31:58.467]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.467 --> 02:31:59.669]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.317 --> 02:32:03.019]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:32:03.019 --> 02:32:04.761]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:32:04.761 --> 02:32:07.443]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:32:07.443 --> 02:32:12.588]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:32:12.588 --> 02:32:15.772]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:33:07.869 --> 02:33:26.741]  Reuters has got another article out, just in the last hour, saying we've got to have a global government, a global currency, and a global carbon tax to pay for it.
[02:33:26.741 --> 02:33:28.863]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:33:28.863 --> 02:33:34.907]  And I just got a chance to go on syndicated radio, so simulcast with TV, with judges.
[02:33:36.104 --> 02:33:40.505]  Napolitano, and hold up the news articles and cover it.
[02:33:40.505 --> 02:33:45.106]  We're going to cover this new one coming up, and then go to your calls, Matthew, Jeff, Zachary, William, Tony, and others.
[02:33:45.106 --> 02:33:46.186]  Be ready with your questions and comments.
[02:33:46.186 --> 02:33:55.929]  I want to get to a lot of you before Peter Dale Scott joins us to talk about the shadow government, how they control the phony right wing, how they control the phony left wing, and where he sees all that going.
[02:33:55.929 --> 02:33:57.149]  He's a big researcher into that.
[02:33:57.149 --> 02:33:58.769]  We've been interviewing over the last decade.
[02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:10.058]  Let's go ahead and finish up with the MIAC Sergeant and State Police trying to spin, and that's putting it kindly, the information in the report.
[02:34:10.058 --> 02:34:10.719]  Let's go back to it.
[02:34:10.719 --> 02:34:25.452]  What that document does is absolutely not true, it's unsubstantiated, and if the report or the training document is read, you would simply see that that's just not the case in the report.
[02:34:26.212 --> 02:34:28.194]  Well, I certainly appreciate that.
[02:34:28.194 --> 02:34:34.318]  What has the response been from the public in general on this, from your perspective?
[02:34:34.318 --> 02:34:36.240]  And is it supportive of the report, or...?
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:46.888]  I don't really know how to say, to answer that, because I really don't know what the general public in general has to say about it.
[02:34:46.888 --> 02:34:52.792]  We've taken some calls here at the MIAC in reference to this thing, but as far as
[02:34:53.208 --> 02:35:04.594]  The general public as a whole, I really don't know what their, and for me to say what the general public's perception of this report is would be absolutely speculative in my opinion.
[02:35:04.594 --> 02:35:13.318]  In terms of the, I guess, you're serving as a public liaison in regards to this report to anybody that calls in, is that really a role that you've taken on here?
[02:35:13.996 --> 02:35:31.403]  Well, my duty is within the Missouri Highway Patrol, the public information officer for the Criminal Division of the Highway Patrol, so anything in regards to the MIAC Center when it comes to public information and dissemination of information, yes, that falls into the scope of my responsibilities.
[02:35:31.403 --> 02:35:40.387]  And you personally don't have any belief that Ron Paul supporters or people who are supporters of the Constitution pose any threat to society at large, I'm assuming, correct?
[02:35:41.874 --> 02:35:52.761]  Personally, speaking for myself, I don't find anybody just because they're affiliated with a certain political group or party or any danger to society or should be labeled that way.
[02:35:52.761 --> 02:35:54.422]  Do members of MIAC take an oath?
[02:35:54.422 --> 02:35:56.323]  They swear an oath to the Constitution?
[02:35:56.323 --> 02:35:59.205]  I don't know what... How about you personally?
[02:35:59.205 --> 02:36:08.811]  I specifically don't know what is entailed when an employee at the MIAC Center, when they're hired on, what oath or what agreement or what they do to obtain their employment.
[02:36:08.811 --> 02:36:11.213]  That's something that you'd have to speak to our human resources.
[02:36:11.752 --> 02:36:13.093]  How about you personally?
[02:36:13.093 --> 02:36:14.814]  You're an officer of the state, right?
[02:36:14.814 --> 02:36:15.974]  Of course, yeah.
[02:36:15.974 --> 02:36:19.776]  And you've taken an oath to be sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution?
[02:36:19.776 --> 02:36:20.717]  That's correct.
[02:36:20.717 --> 02:36:21.797]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:36:21.797 --> 02:36:22.818]  I appreciate that.
[02:36:22.818 --> 02:36:23.538]  Thank you.
[02:36:23.538 --> 02:36:24.719]  Thank you for your time, sir.
[02:36:24.719 --> 02:36:29.562]  Good day.
[02:36:29.562 --> 02:36:32.123]  Okay, so there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:32.123 --> 02:36:40.848]  Notice when I had that Army colonel who sent the 20-plus Army MPs into Alabama after that tragic shooting last week.
[02:36:41.804 --> 02:36:45.666]  Notice that when I said, you sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, he wouldn't answer.
[02:36:45.666 --> 02:36:48.167]  He said, I'm not getting into all of that.
[02:36:48.167 --> 02:36:59.673]  And along those lines, here it is in the Houston Chronicle today and in CNS News, Cyber News Service, Army reviews troop use after fatal Alabama shootings.
[02:37:00.765 --> 02:37:07.990]  The Army has launched an inquiry into whether federal laws were broken when soldiers were sent to an Alabama town after 11 people died in the shooting spree.
[02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:17.077]  The Army confirmed Wednesday that 22 military police and an officer from Fort Rucker, we have the Colonel on, were sent to a nearby town of Sampson after the slayings last week.
[02:37:17.077 --> 02:37:22.081]  The town's tiny police force and county officers were stretched to the limit after the gunman killed 10 people and himself.
[02:37:22.081 --> 02:37:23.262]  This is a PR piece.
[02:37:24.062 --> 02:37:28.585]  Authorization from the Governor or President is typically required for the deployment of federal troops on U.S.
[02:37:28.585 --> 02:37:29.306]  soil.
[02:37:29.306 --> 02:37:32.448]  It's not clear who ordered the troops to be sent into Sampson.
[02:37:32.448 --> 02:37:35.510]  An Army spokesman says the military is trying to determine what happened.
[02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:39.893]  Among the questions is why the troops were sent and what they did there while they were there.
[02:37:39.893 --> 02:37:49.819]  I mean, I read all these mainstream articles from Oregon and Washington State and other places where they're putting regular Army troops in police departments as liaison officers.
[02:37:49.819 --> 02:37:53.422]  They're announcing they're going to be at checkpoints, helping at car wrecks, Marines, Army.
[02:37:54.382 --> 02:37:55.182]  This is happening.
[02:37:55.182 --> 02:37:58.363]  They've announced the Army Times, 20,000 troops on the streets of America.
[02:37:58.363 --> 02:38:00.243]  It's all happening.
[02:38:00.243 --> 02:38:02.804]  But they still haven't completely repealed posse comitatus.
[02:38:02.804 --> 02:38:03.864]  They just put loopholes in it.
[02:38:03.864 --> 02:38:06.865]  You can drive a 747 through.
[02:38:06.865 --> 02:38:12.186]  Army investigating how and why troops were sent into Alabama town after a murder spree.
[02:38:12.186 --> 02:38:12.486]  The U.S.
[02:38:12.486 --> 02:38:21.508]  Army has launched an inquiry into how and why active duty troops from Fort Rucker, Alabama, came to be placed on the streets of Sampson, Alabama, during last week's murder spree in that tiny South Alabama community.
[02:38:22.068 --> 02:38:25.291]  The use of the troops was a possible violation of federal law.
[02:38:25.291 --> 02:38:35.462]  On March 10th, after a report on an apparent mass murder in Sampson, Alabama, 22 military police from Fort Rucker, Alabama, along with the provost marshal, were sent to the city of Sampson.
[02:38:35.462 --> 02:38:37.964]  Harvey Preritt, spokesman for the U.S.
[02:38:37.964 --> 02:38:42.009]  Army Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe, Virginia, told CNS News Monday.
[02:38:42.429 --> 02:38:51.171]  The purpose for sending the military police the authority in doing so and what duties they performed is the subject of an ongoing command inquiry directed by the Commanding General of U.S.
[02:38:51.171 --> 02:38:56.652]  Army Training and Doctrine Command, General Martin Dempsey.
[02:38:56.652 --> 02:39:00.172]  The TRA doc is the headquarters command at Fort Rucker.
[02:39:00.172 --> 02:39:06.273]  Now by the way, we still get emails and comments on the InfoWars and Prison Planet comment section saying we made all this up, this isn't happening.
[02:39:06.273 --> 02:39:07.954]  Doesn't matter if it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[02:39:07.954 --> 02:39:09.794]  PsyOps is in there saying it doesn't exist.
[02:39:14.008 --> 02:39:20.930]  The purpose for sending the military police, it continues, in addition to determining the facts, the inquiry will also determine whether law, regulation, or policy were followed.
[02:39:20.930 --> 02:39:25.672]  Perrott added, until those facts are determined, it would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further.
[02:39:25.672 --> 02:39:37.236]  Jim Stormninger, a dispatcher for the Sampson Police Department, confirmed the MP's presence in the town, telling CNS News that the troops came in to help with traffic control and to secure the crime scene, and the department was glad with the help.
[02:39:37.236 --> 02:39:39.797]  So his violation of posse comitatus goes on from there.
[02:39:43.058 --> 02:39:52.967]  So that's just some of what I have there.
[02:39:52.967 --> 02:39:57.872]  Let me go ahead and cover this article, this group of articles, and we're going to your calls.
[02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:05.082]  Global carbon price unlikely for 10 to 15 years analysts.
[02:40:05.082 --> 02:40:06.202]  This is out of Reuters.
[02:40:06.202 --> 02:40:07.383]  Now, they always do this.
[02:40:07.383 --> 02:40:15.666]  Oh, you know, they have the European Union 50 year celebrations in 2007, but they claim it was founded in 2000.
[02:40:15.666 --> 02:40:20.369]  Bush, it's in endgame, on the White House lawn, admitted they've already merged the EU with the North American Union.
[02:40:20.369 --> 02:40:22.610]  Merkel and Barroso, they're all up there saying it.
[02:40:22.610 --> 02:40:23.230]  Leaders of Europe.
[02:40:24.411 --> 02:40:30.014]  And this is what they do, they go, oh, we're not going to have a carbon tax for a while, don't worry about it, but we've got to agree on one.
[02:40:30.014 --> 02:40:42.300]  Meanwhile, here's the London Telegraph, and literally scores of other publications, saying the IMF is printing a super currency already and issuing it to banks, but it's all secret.
[02:40:42.300 --> 02:40:48.403]  So, you pay your taxes through the federal government, the IMF and World Bank, and then they basically issue it to their cronies and their buddies.
[02:40:50.077 --> 02:40:50.637]  Then it goes on.
[02:40:50.637 --> 02:41:00.545]  The International Monetary Fund is poised to embark on what analysts have described as global quantitative easing by printing millions of dollars worth of global super currency in an unprecedented new effort to address the economic crisis.
[02:41:00.545 --> 02:41:04.909]  We've got a story up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:41:04.909 --> 02:41:06.190]  It's here in my stack.
[02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:07.611]  I'm trying to find it.
[02:41:07.611 --> 02:41:09.592]  Where they say they're already issuing it.
[02:41:09.592 --> 02:41:10.853]  So, that's how...
[02:41:12.674 --> 02:41:13.895]  They work and how they operate.
[02:41:13.895 --> 02:41:16.977]  They say, we're going to start doing this, and you find out they've already been doing it.
[02:41:16.977 --> 02:41:21.600]  And the private Federal Reserve has been issuing secret, secret new funds.
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:24.261]  That was in the New York Times three months ago.
[02:41:24.261 --> 02:41:28.484]  So that's why Geithner will never answer what they're doing, because they're setting up a global government.
[02:41:28.484 --> 02:41:30.906]  And they don't want the public to know about it.
[02:41:30.906 --> 02:41:36.810]  But then when you read the financial publications, they admit what's happening.
[02:41:36.810 --> 02:41:38.911]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[02:41:38.911 --> 02:41:41.793]  Matthew in Montana, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:41:42.429 --> 02:41:44.290]  Hello, Alex from Montana.
[02:41:44.290 --> 02:41:46.752]  Long live the Republic and long live the truth.
[02:41:46.752 --> 02:41:56.679]  We're doing our job over here in Montana and getting hours of your documentaries out on AXS television every week for years now.
[02:41:56.679 --> 02:41:59.661]  Has it had an effect in your area?
[02:41:59.661 --> 02:42:01.002]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:42:01.002 --> 02:42:09.708]  I think Montana is at the forefront of freedom and the Second Amendment, as you know, the state sovereignty movement, and now the latest
[02:42:11.260 --> 02:42:19.212]  That's on GCN page, the hard money issue is going through the state legislature right now.
[02:42:19.212 --> 02:42:21.495]  We're fighting a good fight.
[02:42:25.115 --> 02:42:32.357]  I mean, we're still a minority, but a much larger minority compared to, you know, like you were pointing out 10 or 20 years ago.
[02:42:32.357 --> 02:42:35.878]  I've been... But that's just because the general public, all of them, don't know about us.
[02:42:35.878 --> 02:42:38.359]  If you ask the public, are you against the banks robbing you blind?
[02:42:38.359 --> 02:42:42.240]  Are you against the unelected world government run by the banks that did it?
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:43.400]  Are you against open borders?
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:44.540]  They're against everything.
[02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:45.441]  They agree with us.
[02:42:45.441 --> 02:42:46.261]  It's common sense.
[02:42:46.897 --> 02:42:49.220]  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
[02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:55.046]  And we're a threat to the New World Order, or they wouldn't be secretly demonizing us to every police agency out there.
[02:42:55.046 --> 02:42:57.288]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[02:42:57.288 --> 02:43:00.452]  And when I say a minority, I mean that in a positive way.
[02:43:00.452 --> 02:43:07.980]  I mean, we, you know, years ago we were a small percentage, and now I don't know what we are, 10, 20 percent, you know, so.
[02:43:09.521 --> 02:43:16.063]  We're definitely having an impact, and as you point out, the truth is exploding exponentially.
[02:43:16.063 --> 02:43:19.984]  Oh my gosh, it's frightening.
[02:43:19.984 --> 02:43:35.849]  I was doing this years ago during Gulf War I. I was publishing a paper and going on radio and TV, and just like you were pointing out, I'd come home and my answering machine would just be full of calls calling me a traitor and anti-American and everything else because of that time.
[02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:45.221]  We were talking about the New World Order, bringing out the documents, showing everybody, and of course we were called anti-American and everything else.
[02:43:45.221 --> 02:43:56.074]  But thank God, going into the 21st century, people like yourself have taken the lead and going forward with the truth.
[02:43:57.026 --> 02:44:01.828]  And getting it out there, because like you point out, the truth will ultimately prevail, and it is prevailing.
[02:44:01.828 --> 02:44:04.108]  Absolutely, sir, I appreciate your call.
[02:44:04.108 --> 02:44:21.034]  I was just watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, they put the website up there with rotating articles, and I saw and confirmed a bunch of Facebook accounts with hundreds, and in some cases thousands of members, erasing links to the Obama deception, banning accounts that put out the Obama deception, and
[02:44:23.038 --> 02:44:35.389]  I was just looking on the screen, I'm trying to pull it up, I saw a new censorship article dealing with the Obama deception, but my computer, my little $300 Acer is not loading.
[02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:39.172]  It says, Christian, YouTube censors Obama deception.
[02:44:39.172 --> 02:44:40.533]  What does that mean?
[02:44:40.533 --> 02:44:44.837]  It says, a site that brands itself as a kind of YouTube for Christians.
[02:44:47.355 --> 02:44:56.188]  Which was formerly known as GodTube.com has censored Alex Jones's newest film, The Obama Deception, after claiming the documentary
[02:45:00.708 --> 02:45:01.068]  I don't know.
[02:45:21.516 --> 02:45:26.019]  We cannot allow this content on the site without documented proof of the accusations.
[02:45:26.019 --> 02:45:28.721]  Please refer to our terms of use information.
[02:45:28.721 --> 02:45:29.261]  Well, that's fine.
[02:45:29.261 --> 02:45:31.743]  It's their little miserable censorship channel.
[02:45:31.743 --> 02:45:45.713]  I mean, you know, I don't know about this site, but most of the big churches publicly, Obama's continuing the faith-based initiative, tens of billions of churches, and they're buying them off the clergy response teams, you know, to go out and tell people to accept martial law and Obama's of God and of the Lord.
[02:45:45.713 --> 02:45:49.635]  We've shown you what they teach in Catholic, Protestant churches.
[02:45:49.635 --> 02:45:50.276]  It doesn't matter.
[02:45:51.624 --> 02:45:55.526]  And so there you have it, more and more censorship of the Obama deception.
[02:45:55.526 --> 02:46:03.210]  And I read in the first hour how all over the world, Canada, Australia, they're just saying we're going to ban political websites.
[02:46:03.210 --> 02:46:04.891]  It's now happening.
[02:46:04.891 --> 02:46:07.672]  This is really going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:07.672 --> 02:46:12.034]  And so I suggest that everybody go to the website.
[02:46:12.034 --> 02:46:14.836]  In fact, give me the specific address.
[02:46:14.836 --> 02:46:16.877]  Will you scroll down a bit so I can see it, guys?
[02:46:16.877 --> 02:46:18.118]  Or just print me the story?
[02:46:18.118 --> 02:46:19.498]  It's kind of hard to read it when I can't see it.
[02:46:19.498 --> 02:46:19.698]  Thanks.
[02:46:22.642 --> 02:46:26.163]  The website is tangle.com.
[02:46:26.163 --> 02:46:33.744]  People should just go and upload lots of short videos saying, go to theobamadeception.net and find out what's being censored.
[02:46:33.744 --> 02:46:37.905]  Just keep uploading it over and over again and they won't be able to stop you doing that.
[02:46:37.905 --> 02:46:40.285]  Just upload 20 second videos.
[02:46:40.285 --> 02:46:43.346]  Basically, it's quick and easy to get that done.
[02:46:43.346 --> 02:46:47.647]  But yes, and as Obamadeception goes more and more viral, you're going to see more and more of this censorship.
[02:46:49.568 --> 02:46:55.115]  Let's go ahead and go back to the callers here.
[02:46:55.115 --> 02:46:57.237]  Let's talk to Jeff in Ohio.
[02:46:57.237 --> 02:46:58.078]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:46:58.078 --> 02:47:00.281]  Yeah, what's up Alex?
[02:47:00.281 --> 02:47:03.144]  I just have a couple questions for you.
[02:47:03.144 --> 02:47:07.550]  I don't know if you know anything about Sandusky, Ohio being built after the square and compass.
[02:47:09.116 --> 02:47:24.267]  I know a lot of major cities and even small towns like the place where Skull and Bones is located in Connecticut, that they are set up according to the sacred geometry or architecture, yes.
[02:47:24.267 --> 02:47:36.216]  Alright, well I was just wondering, here in Ohio on Saturday they have every Masonic Lodge has got an open house, supposedly, and I was just wondering
[02:47:36.906 --> 02:47:41.419]  On your opinion, you think it'd be a good idea, a bad idea to go and try and ask questions?
[02:47:41.419 --> 02:47:42.221]  Oh, I think it's great.
[02:47:42.221 --> 02:47:44.488]  Look, you're going to find... I want to be clear about this...
[02:47:46.138 --> 02:47:50.841]  And I always mention this, and people act like it's some big secret, and they found me out when it was on my show.
[02:47:50.841 --> 02:47:52.422]  We're on air right now.
[02:47:52.422 --> 02:47:56.565]  They'll cut clips out and go, this was secretly behind scenes with Alex on TV, and we have it.
[02:47:56.565 --> 02:48:00.988]  And then they clip it to real short with me going, I have family that are Masons.
[02:48:00.988 --> 02:48:03.690]  And then, look, look, we caught the secret video.
[02:48:03.690 --> 02:48:06.152]  It's all sorts of deception is used.
[02:48:06.152 --> 02:48:07.653]  You know, it's a lone star state.
[02:48:07.653 --> 02:48:11.336]  Texas was founded by predominantly Masons.
[02:48:11.336 --> 02:48:13.677]  And George Washington was a Mason.
[02:48:13.677 --> 02:48:15.419]  I guess about half the founders were.
[02:48:16.832 --> 02:48:19.693]  But they were what you'd call porch masons.
[02:48:19.693 --> 02:48:23.575]  And it's such a complex situation.
[02:48:23.575 --> 02:48:27.016]  Technology, mathematics, knowledge has always been power.
[02:48:27.016 --> 02:48:37.080]  And you go back 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 years ago in Babylon and Egypt, or then in Israel later, or in Tyre, or in Greece, or in Rome, knowledge was very coveted.
[02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:39.260]  And they had secret mystery schools.
[02:48:39.260 --> 02:48:43.862]  When you hear mystery schools, it had all these gods and mumbo-jumbo and temple prostitutes and everything else.
[02:48:43.862 --> 02:48:45.683]  But it was also mathematics.
[02:48:46.623 --> 02:48:51.204]  And, you know, they called, you know, basically metal work, you know, alchemy.
[02:48:51.204 --> 02:48:55.205]  So science was mixed in with superstition and mumbo-jumbo.
[02:48:55.205 --> 02:48:57.706]  And so you have these fraternal brotherhoods.
[02:48:57.706 --> 02:49:04.868]  But clearly, masonry has been used as a vehicle in the last 300 years for dark forces.
[02:49:04.868 --> 02:49:08.448]  You know, secret societies before were what we call intelligence agencies today.
[02:49:08.448 --> 02:49:14.170]  And George Washington, before he died, said there's something terrible in masonry, something bad in it, there's bad people at the higher levels of it.
[02:49:15.276 --> 02:49:15.396]  Yeah.
[02:49:33.502 --> 02:49:34.723]  Sam Houston was a Mason.
[02:49:34.723 --> 02:49:37.706]  They were not bad people.
[02:49:37.706 --> 02:49:42.890]  I believe Andrew Jackson was a Mason, but he fought the Global Bankers and the New World Order, the British Masons.
[02:49:42.890 --> 02:49:49.395]  So it's an oversimplification to think that you're going to go into any Masonic lodge and there are a bunch of devil worshippers.
[02:49:49.395 --> 02:49:53.999]  They don't know that in the higher degrees, and this is a fact, morals and dogma
[02:49:55.243 --> 02:50:02.828]  You know, Albert Pike, the books that Manly P. Hall wrote, which are published and available, go to the library and read them.
[02:50:02.828 --> 02:50:06.871]  They openly say at the higher levels, it is Lucifer they're worshipping, and that's a bad thing.
[02:50:06.871 --> 02:50:13.535]  But they believe Lucifer is really the good God, and the other God is like his brother in his bag, as he tried to keep the knowledge from the people.
[02:50:13.535 --> 02:50:15.296]  In fact, pull up that YouTube, just Google,
[02:50:16.377 --> 02:50:20.018]  Mason says he loves Lucifer, where he goes, oh, sweet Lucifer.
[02:50:20.018 --> 02:50:27.340]  And you know, people watch this, you see Mason's commenting, oh, well, he was just joking, because they're lower Masons and don't know this is really what's going on.
[02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:37.944]  So I would go to them and explain to them in that way and ask them questions and give them a copy of the Obama Deception, because we've got to go after Jews, Muslims, Christians, Masons,
[02:50:38.744 --> 02:50:39.545]  Yeah, it actually does.
[02:51:01.616 --> 02:51:07.040]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:16.247]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[02:51:16.247 --> 02:51:19.630]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[02:51:19.650 --> 02:51:20.030]  I think so.
[02:51:41.704 --> 02:51:44.426]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[02:52:05.325 --> 02:52:07.946]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.946 --> 02:52:14.930]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.521 --> 02:52:22.104]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:22.104 --> 02:52:24.084]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:24.084 --> 02:52:26.585]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.585 --> 02:52:37.550]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:38.169 --> 02:52:39.830]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:41.690]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:41.690 --> 02:52:48.593]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:48.593 --> 02:52:56.856]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:56.856 --> 02:52:58.436]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.436 --> 02:52:59.637]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.832 --> 02:53:09.499]  We know identity scams have grown in the past six months because identity thieves are working overtime, taking advantage of this economic crisis.
[02:53:09.499 --> 02:53:11.501]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock.
[02:53:11.501 --> 02:53:16.566]  I talk to people every day about identity theft, and I know a lot of you are scared and nervous.
[02:53:16.886 --> 02:53:18.947]  I'm here to tell you, you don't have to be.
[02:53:18.947 --> 02:53:27.331]  Another identity is stolen every three seconds, but you can have the security and peace of mind that comes with being protected by LifeLock for just pennies a day.
[02:53:27.331 --> 02:53:36.515]  LifeLock is number one in identity theft protection because we work to stop identity theft before it happens, or we fix it at our expense up to one million dollars.
[02:53:36.795 --> 02:53:38.896]  Don't spend another minute worrying.
[02:53:38.896 --> 02:53:40.237]  Call LifeLock now.
[02:53:40.237 --> 02:53:42.018]  Get instant protection by calling 1-800-605-4229.

[02:53:45.139 --> 02:53:45.700]  Use promo code FREEMONK.
[02:53:45.700 --> 02:53:46.020]  Call 1-800-605-4229.
[02:53:46.020 --> 02:53:46.280]  Again, 1-800-605-4229.
[02:54:08.075 --> 02:54:14.160]  The Dallas Observer just did a review of the Obama deception.
[02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:22.728]  But they said, oh, Jones is claiming millions of views, but it only says 160,000 on a YouTube channel.
[02:54:22.728 --> 02:54:27.351]  There's hundreds of versions of it posted on YouTube and Google.
[02:54:28.567 --> 02:54:43.456]  And you'll see one with two hundred and something thousand views, and another with a hundred and sixty thousand views, and another with a hundred and twenty thousand views, another with eighty thousand views, another with a hundred and twenty thousand views, another with, you know, two hundred and fifty thousand views.
[02:54:43.456 --> 02:54:44.236]  That's what we're seeing.
[02:54:44.236 --> 02:54:49.199]  See how people think kind of two-dimensionally instead of three-dimensionally?
[02:54:49.199 --> 02:54:56.163]  They say, oh, well, I'm seeing one copy of it that says a hundred and sixty thousand views, so that means there's not millions watching.
[02:54:56.163 --> 02:54:56.904]  What does that mean?
[02:54:59.534 --> 02:55:01.976]  I mean, why don't people's brains work right?
[02:55:01.976 --> 02:55:04.477]  We're not even trying to go see where it's posted everywhere.
[02:55:04.477 --> 02:55:06.759]  It's all over every video site we've looked at.
[02:55:06.759 --> 02:55:07.760]  Hundreds that we've looked at.
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:09.621]  Burmese is obsessed with this stuff.
[02:55:09.621 --> 02:55:12.343]  And they're just hours loving it.
[02:55:12.343 --> 02:55:13.624]  He loves to communicate with humanity.
[02:55:13.624 --> 02:55:14.585]  He loves to be involved in this.
[02:55:15.752 --> 02:55:18.215]  And it's very exciting, so it is free all over the internet.
[02:55:18.215 --> 02:55:22.560]  But the best quality copy has changed to Channel's Channel on YouTube.
[02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:24.982]  Super good in code for YouTube.
[02:55:24.982 --> 02:55:28.126]  That's the one we've linked to at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:28.126 --> 02:55:29.688]  We want to make that number one.
[02:55:29.688 --> 02:55:32.210]  There's a bunch of cruddy copies with two hundred and something thousand views.
[02:55:33.453 --> 02:55:34.153]  Above it.
[02:55:34.153 --> 02:55:37.634]  So that's what's linked all over the web when you Google the Obama deception.
[02:55:37.634 --> 02:55:50.117]  So, in fact, ask Kurt and Paul and them just to post again somewhere on the main page for the next few days so people can find it easy, not just in sub-pages or it moves down the page, the change-the-channel version, so we can drive that up to number one.
[02:55:50.117 --> 02:55:54.179]  So people, if they're going to take two hours out to watch it, we'll see it in high quality.
[02:55:54.179 --> 02:55:58.880]  See it in super high quality compared to that at PrisonPlanet.tv and fund our operation, and we need the capital.
[02:56:00.049 --> 02:56:06.512]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls the next segment, and then on into Peter Del Scott coming on.
[02:56:06.512 --> 02:56:08.852]  Speaking of sponsors, I am such a ding-dong.
[02:56:08.852 --> 02:56:10.413]  You know, I check out all the sponsors we take.
[02:56:10.413 --> 02:56:12.734]  I like them, I support them, and then I'm so brain-dead.
[02:56:12.734 --> 02:56:18.736]  I said the name of this site wrong yesterday like a ding-dong, but it's HomeGain.com.
[02:56:18.736 --> 02:56:21.537]  HomeGain.com.
[02:56:21.537 --> 02:56:25.559]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.
[02:56:25.979 --> 02:56:28.721]  HomeGain.com.
[02:56:28.721 --> 02:56:37.685]  This is the place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, and getting any real estate questions answered.
[02:56:37.685 --> 02:56:41.787]  Go to HomeGain.com and see what I'm talking about.
[02:56:41.787 --> 02:56:44.349]  The one I plugged wrongly yesterday was some RFID site.
[02:56:47.023 --> 02:56:53.148]  All you need to do is type in your home address and you will get an instant free estimate on your home values online.
[02:56:53.148 --> 02:56:58.093]  It is a great way to be able to monitor the value of your home for a month to month or even weekly.
[02:56:58.093 --> 02:56:59.013]  And again, it's free.
[02:56:59.013 --> 02:57:01.475]  There are tons of tools to help you.
[02:57:01.475 --> 02:57:05.639]  For instance, if you want to remodel your home, go to homegain.com.
[02:57:05.639 --> 02:57:12.125]  Use their home sales maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[02:57:12.705 --> 02:57:14.108]  I wish I knew about this thing years ago.
[02:57:14.108 --> 02:57:15.151]  Yeah, it's really neat.
[02:57:15.151 --> 02:57:18.679]  For 10 years, these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.
[02:57:18.679 --> 02:57:19.701]  It's HomeGain.com.
[02:57:22.810 --> 02:57:24.651]  And of course, this sponsor needs no introduction.
[02:57:24.651 --> 02:57:25.832]  They're just fabulous folks.
[02:57:25.832 --> 02:57:28.334]  The best storable foods company out there.
[02:57:28.334 --> 02:57:29.495]  Super high quality food.
[02:57:29.495 --> 02:57:30.215]  Non-GMO.
[02:57:30.215 --> 02:57:30.796]  Just packaged.
[02:57:30.796 --> 02:57:33.417]  Within weeks of them shipping it out to you.
[02:57:33.417 --> 02:57:35.979]  So please check out efoodsdirect.com.
[02:57:35.979 --> 02:57:39.001]  Go there and watch the free videos about their great food products.

[02:57:44.505 --> 02:57:49.166]  I've got a three-day first responder that's like $21.95, three days of food for one person.
[02:57:49.166 --> 02:57:56.929]  Kind of as a sampler, I suggest you get eFoodsDirect.com, the letter eFoodsDirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633.
[02:57:56.929 --> 02:57:57.429]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[02:57:57.429 --> 02:58:08.573]  And then on the line of preparedness, we just love ours, and I've got one at my house as well, Ecoloblue, E-C-O-L-O-BLUE.com, atmospheric water generator for your home.
[02:58:08.573 --> 02:58:12.574]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store, pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[02:58:13.274 --> 02:58:14.774]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[02:58:14.774 --> 02:58:15.975]  Know exactly what you're drinking.
[02:58:15.975 --> 02:58:19.415]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water, 24 hours, 7.5 gallons.
[02:58:19.415 --> 02:58:20.776]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[02:58:20.776 --> 02:58:22.256]  Neutral pH.
[02:58:22.256 --> 02:58:27.357]  And it runs through seven different filters, including UV light, carbon filter, and reverse osmosis.
[02:58:27.357 --> 02:58:28.517]  It doesn't get any better than this.
[02:58:28.517 --> 02:58:29.058]  acolablue.com.
[02:58:29.058 --> 02:58:30.338]  E-C-O-L-L-E-B-L-U-E dot com, or 800-691-6043.
[02:58:30.338 --> 02:58:30.758]  800-691-6043. acolablue.com.
[02:58:30.758 --> 02:58:31.838]  All right, final hour, straight ahead.

[02:58:43.075 --> 02:58:46.477]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.477 --> 02:58:51.461]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.461 --> 02:58:52.101]  Hello, friends.
[02:58:52.101 --> 02:58:53.162]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.162 --> 02:58:57.905]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.905 --> 02:59:00.867]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.867 --> 02:59:03.909]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.909 --> 02:59:08.612]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.852 --> 02:59:09.973]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.973 --> 02:59:13.217]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.217 --> 02:59:20.225]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.225 --> 02:59:23.489]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.489 --> 02:59:23.749]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:26.172 --> 02:59:28.633]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:28.633 --> 02:59:34.895]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:34.895 --> 02:59:38.496]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.496 --> 02:59:40.017]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:40.017 --> 02:59:40.637]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.637 --> 02:59:42.458]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.215 --> 02:59:56.624]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.624 --> 02:59:59.393]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:07.005 --> 03:00:08.806]  Yeah, Peter Dale Scott's coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:08.806 --> 03:00:10.627]  We'll also take calls during that.
[03:00:10.627 --> 03:00:19.132]  This is the type of stuff that comes in our mail every day, not just secret state police reports, saying anybody that loves America is a terrorist, basically.
[03:00:19.132 --> 03:00:25.015]  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, in conjunction with the officers of Superior Gloria Molina First District,
[03:00:25.973 --> 03:00:33.679]  That says, gifts for guns, exchange your firearms for gift cards, Walmart, Ralph's Supermarkets, food for less supermarkets, and Target stores.
[03:00:33.679 --> 03:00:35.180]  No questions asked.
[03:00:35.180 --> 03:00:36.240]  No strings attached.
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:38.062]  And every time we check this, it's not true.
[03:00:38.062 --> 03:00:39.923]  There are strings attached.
[03:00:39.923 --> 03:00:40.744]  You remain anonymous.
[03:00:40.744 --> 03:00:43.186]  Please leave your firearms in the trunk of your car.
[03:00:43.186 --> 03:00:46.208]  Because they come to your car to get your license plate when they take it.
[03:00:46.208 --> 03:00:47.369]  Oh my God.
[03:00:47.369 --> 03:00:48.770]  Join us March 28th, 2009.
[03:00:48.770 --> 03:00:50.711]  The cops lie, folks.
[03:00:50.711 --> 03:00:52.152]  It's, they're trained to.
[03:00:52.152 --> 03:00:52.592]  Register.
[03:00:55.100 --> 03:00:56.842]  And it says, uh, rear parking lot.
[03:00:56.842 --> 03:01:01.608]  So you register your name, you go in, they go to your car and register you, but, oh, it's anonymous.
[03:01:01.608 --> 03:01:03.791]  Right here it contradicts itself.
[03:01:03.791 --> 03:01:05.974]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:05.974 --> 03:01:08.357]  You register, they come out to your car, they get it.
[03:01:08.357 --> 03:01:11.601]  You register, but, but they don't know you gave them a gun.
[03:01:11.601 --> 03:01:12.883]  For a, uh, gift certificate.
[03:01:14.667 --> 03:01:20.930]  This is the type of crap, as they, and they always have news cameras there to create the image of, to condition people.
[03:01:20.930 --> 03:01:26.012]  They did this in England and Australia before they confiscated guns, to have the images of people lined up turning guns in.
[03:01:26.012 --> 03:01:27.993]  They're doing this in Dallas, Texas.
[03:01:27.993 --> 03:01:29.394]  They're doing this in every state.
[03:01:29.394 --> 03:01:30.415]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[03:01:30.415 --> 03:01:33.196]  It doesn't say what you get here.
[03:01:35.503 --> 03:01:40.305]  There's a little asterisk that says, for gift cards, and I don't see the asterisk.
[03:01:40.305 --> 03:01:41.925]  It says, while supplies last.
[03:01:41.925 --> 03:01:44.446]  So, that means they'll just go, ah, go ahead and give me that gun.
[03:01:44.446 --> 03:01:46.887]  Oh, they're going to arrest some people.
[03:01:46.887 --> 03:01:48.268]  They run the backgrounds on the guns.
[03:01:48.268 --> 03:01:48.808]  What idiots.
[03:01:48.808 --> 03:01:50.008]  But, hey, they want to be slaves.
[03:01:50.008 --> 03:01:51.029]  Go ahead.
[03:01:51.029 --> 03:01:55.750]  Let's go ahead and talk to William in Michigan, and Groom, Melissa, Danny, Alex, and others.
[03:01:55.750 --> 03:01:57.191]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, stop!
[03:01:57.191 --> 03:01:58.311]  Alex disagrees.
[03:01:58.311 --> 03:01:59.852]  I'd miss seeing that.
[03:02:00.892 --> 03:02:03.054]  Uh, so let's go to the head of the line for him.
[03:02:03.054 --> 03:02:04.655]  We can remain civil.
[03:02:04.655 --> 03:02:05.395]  We'll keep him on a minute.
[03:02:05.395 --> 03:02:06.936]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:02:06.936 --> 03:02:08.197]  I don't.
[03:02:08.197 --> 03:02:11.359]  Um, I wanted, uh, can you hear me alright, first of all?
[03:02:11.359 --> 03:02:14.701]  Is this the guy always calling in, plugging his music videos?
[03:02:14.701 --> 03:02:16.643]  No, no, I don't even know who that is.
[03:02:16.643 --> 03:02:18.044]  Okay, because the guy calls with different names.
[03:02:18.044 --> 03:02:20.665]  Okay, go ahead and make your point, sir.
[03:02:20.665 --> 03:02:27.930]  Okay, um, well you were talking about Freemasonry, and you make the point a lot where you say, um, that there were porch masons.
[03:02:27.930 --> 03:02:29.491]  I don't think that's the case at all.
[03:02:29.491 --> 03:02:30.352]  Like, for case in point.
[03:02:31.292 --> 03:02:42.443]  Andrew Jackson, that guy who shut down the first two national banks that they tried to set up in our country, he wasn't just some kind of porch mason.
[03:02:42.443 --> 03:02:47.528]  He was the Grand Master of Tennessee Freemasonry.
[03:02:47.528 --> 03:02:49.270]  I knew I'd read that he was a mason, yeah.
[03:02:50.492 --> 03:02:52.693]  That's what I said five minutes ago.
[03:02:52.693 --> 03:02:57.256]  He was the Grand Master of Tennessee Freemasonry.
[03:02:57.256 --> 03:03:00.618]  Well, I just said Texas was founded by Masons.
[03:03:00.618 --> 03:03:07.942]  Are you saying that there aren't all these top Masons that have published books saying their god is Lucifer?
[03:03:09.326 --> 03:03:15.151]  Oh, sure, but they think Jesus is Lucifer, though, so they have this weird, like, take on it.
[03:03:15.151 --> 03:03:15.851]  That's kind of it.
[03:03:15.851 --> 03:03:16.872]  No, that's a mid-level.
[03:03:16.872 --> 03:03:19.054]  No, they think it's dual.
[03:03:19.054 --> 03:03:20.995]  But it's two different creatures.
[03:03:20.995 --> 03:03:24.478]  Look, I mean, okay, so you disagree with that.
[03:03:24.478 --> 03:03:25.278]  You're right.
[03:03:25.278 --> 03:03:26.840]  Some of them weren't porch masons.
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:31.023]  My point is, is that George Washington did speak out about what was happening in masonry.
[03:03:31.023 --> 03:03:32.464]  That's on record.
[03:03:32.464 --> 03:03:38.288]  Oh, yeah, the top-level masons in England spoke out about what was happening in masonry, too.
[03:03:40.074 --> 03:03:42.436]  I forgot who his name was.
[03:03:42.436 --> 03:03:50.422]  He was one of the top grandmasters of English Freemasonry, talking about some son of order taking over Freemasonry.
[03:03:50.422 --> 03:03:54.445]  Black son, yeah.
[03:03:54.445 --> 03:04:01.231]  But this is where it gets kind of... Let me ask you a question.
[03:04:01.231 --> 03:04:02.792]  Do you like people like Chiang Kai-shek?
[03:04:02.792 --> 03:04:06.255]  Chiang Kai-shek, the guy who fought Mao Zedong.
[03:04:06.255 --> 03:04:07.135]  China.
[03:04:07.135 --> 03:04:07.736]  China.
[03:04:07.736 --> 03:04:09.097]  That guy was a big Freemason.
[03:04:10.578 --> 03:04:17.004]  Yeah, and the CIA betrayed him, and kicked him out, and didn't give him the weapons, and put Mao in, and that's now declassified.
[03:04:17.004 --> 03:04:18.425]  Look at something like the CIA.
[03:04:18.425 --> 03:04:20.867]  I haven't seen any Freemasons in the CIA.
[03:04:20.867 --> 03:04:23.189]  I've only seen... Oh, are you joking?
[03:04:23.189 --> 03:04:23.669]  Are you joking?
[03:04:23.669 --> 03:04:24.670]  I got Allen Dulles.
[03:04:24.670 --> 03:04:28.213]  I got a big amount of... Well, there's lots of... Hold on, hold on a second.
[03:04:28.213 --> 03:04:30.335]  You know, you're not letting me talk.
[03:04:30.335 --> 03:04:32.057]  You just keep mumbling.
[03:04:32.057 --> 03:04:37.621]  I mean, I'm letting you make your points, but you just said you haven't seen any Freemasons in the CIA.
[03:04:41.018 --> 03:04:41.218]  You worry.
[03:04:41.218 --> 03:04:42.219]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[03:04:42.219 --> 03:04:43.340]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[03:04:43.340 --> 03:04:44.901]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[03:05:09.656 --> 03:05:11.258]  Your answer may be at hand.
[03:05:11.258 --> 03:05:14.861]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[03:05:14.861 --> 03:05:20.106]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[03:05:20.106 --> 03:05:24.070]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[03:05:24.070 --> 03:05:25.752]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[03:05:25.752 --> 03:05:28.675]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[03:05:28.675 --> 03:05:31.618]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[03:05:32.096 --> 03:05:40.738]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[03:05:40.738 --> 03:05:45.558]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[03:05:54.980 --> 03:05:56.700]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[03:06:02.145 --> 03:06:07.955]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.955 --> 03:06:14.967]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.524 --> 03:06:22.107]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:22.107 --> 03:06:24.087]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:24.087 --> 03:06:26.589]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.589 --> 03:06:37.573]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.175 --> 03:06:39.836]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.836 --> 03:06:41.698]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:41.698 --> 03:06:48.603]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:06:56.869 --> 03:06:58.450]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.450 --> 03:06:59.631]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.579 --> 03:07:07.524]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:07:07.524 --> 03:07:12.329]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[03:07:12.329 --> 03:07:17.754]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[03:07:17.754 --> 03:07:21.137]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[03:07:21.657 --> 03:07:30.182]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[03:07:30.182 --> 03:07:35.986]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[03:07:35.986 --> 03:07:41.970]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:07:41.970 --> 03:07:44.291]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[03:07:44.551 --> 03:07:47.215]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[03:08:03.234 --> 03:08:09.857]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.857 --> 03:08:13.658]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.658 --> 03:08:15.058]  Okay, we are back live.
[03:08:15.058 --> 03:08:16.519]  Got about 52 minutes left in the show.
[03:08:16.519 --> 03:08:19.340]  We'll open the phones up at the bottom of the hour.
[03:08:19.340 --> 03:08:21.621]  Professor Peter Dell Scott is our guest.
[03:08:21.621 --> 03:08:25.482]  Author, researcher, just an amazing individual.
[03:08:25.482 --> 03:08:31.845]  Peter, you've got such an interesting bio, and you wrote seminal works exposing government narcotics trafficking.
[03:08:33.726 --> 03:08:44.996]  I don't even know where to start with you, but he's a Canadian poet and former English professor at the University of California, Berkeley, the son of noted Canadian poet and constitutional lawyer F.R.
[03:08:44.996 --> 03:08:46.097]  Scott.
[03:08:46.097 --> 03:08:48.759]  He is known for his anti-war stance and his criticism of U.S.
[03:08:48.759 --> 03:08:51.061]  foreign policy dating back to the Vietnam War.
[03:08:51.061 --> 03:08:54.264]  He's researched and written several investigative books about the role of deep state
[03:08:54.924 --> 03:08:57.626]  As opposed to the public state, or I'd call shadow government.
[03:08:57.626 --> 03:09:04.690]  However, Scott rejects the label of conspiracy theory and has used the phrase deep politics to describe his heavily footnoted political writing.
[03:09:04.690 --> 03:09:05.611]  The investigative bent.
[03:09:06.565 --> 03:09:16.975]  Uh, has spilt over into his works of poetry, some of which must contain marginal notes to explain to readers, uh, which documents or real-world news events are being referred to.
[03:09:16.975 --> 03:09:23.681]  His most recent book, The Road to 9-11, from the University of California Press, details, with historical and geopolitical context, the events of 9-11.
[03:09:23.681 --> 03:09:26.684]  And, uh, it goes on from this.
[03:09:28.462 --> 03:09:31.483]  Professor Peter Del Scott, good to have you here with us today.
[03:09:31.483 --> 03:09:40.907]  I want to get your view on Obama, the people behind him, the overarching banking structure, what is at the heart from your research of the deep state, what Carol Quigley wrote about it, Georgetown.
[03:09:40.907 --> 03:09:52.492]  Then I want to get into kind of the left-wing management groups that manage the left, and how they control the anti-war movement, and then some of the right-wing control groups as well, and how they kind of have that synthesis.
[03:09:52.492 --> 03:09:54.212]  It's good to have you here with us.
[03:09:54.212 --> 03:09:55.553]  I'm glad you're back on the show.
[03:09:56.438 --> 03:10:13.465]  You've given me a tall agenda there to deal with in one hour, but yes, I think that people are probably more aware now than they were a couple of years ago just how little wiggle room there is in American politics.
[03:10:13.465 --> 03:10:24.769]  We had a huge bailout for the banks when Bush was president, and now we have a new president, and we have another huge bailout that looks remarkably like the first one.
[03:10:25.427 --> 03:10:36.635]  Which seems to validate what Gore Vidal said once, you know, that we have only one political party in this country, the Property Party, with two right wings.
[03:10:36.635 --> 03:10:53.107]  Both parties, I think, are very indebted to the money that gets them elected, and that money comes from the same sources for both parties, the big oil companies, the big banks, the whole, what's now called the Petroleum Financial Military Complex.
[03:10:53.968 --> 03:11:02.050]  That has really been taxing this country for its own ends since World War II.
[03:11:02.050 --> 03:11:04.111]  Please continue.
[03:11:04.111 --> 03:11:22.596]  Well, when we talk about one party with two right wings, for a long time people thought, and there was some truth, that the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, representing Wall Street banks and law firms,
[03:11:23.226 --> 03:11:25.548]  Was the real power in determining U.S.
[03:11:25.548 --> 03:11:49.664]  foreign policy, and, you know, as evidence for that, you could point to the fact that it was really they who pushed Truman into creating a CIA, which, back in 1947, which was then populated at the top, I think of the seven known deputy directors of the CIA in its first two years,
[03:11:50.853 --> 03:11:55.617]  All but one were from Wall Street banks and firms.
[03:11:55.617 --> 03:12:10.867]  And in addition to that, they were also, all but one of those were from the New York Social Register, the kind of high society that represented the real wealth of New York.
[03:12:10.867 --> 03:12:18.352]  Now, the CFR doesn't have the power now that it used to have then, and that's largely because of the Reagan Revolution.
[03:12:19.019 --> 03:12:36.003]  And what I say in my book is a real power grab that happened really under Ford in 1975 when Cheney and Rumsfeld, two names that were being very powerful in American politics from the time that they were both in Ford's White House.
[03:12:36.003 --> 03:12:45.306]  That's right, they were there when the National Security Dictatorship said to the Continuity of Government, this is our chance to take over, and we saw them pretty much try to repeat that under Bush, didn't we?
[03:12:45.799 --> 03:12:51.481]  Yeah, well, they planned for the whole continuity of government.
[03:12:51.481 --> 03:13:07.828]  It's not surprising they were doing it under Reagan, although it's a little surprising because Rumsfeld wasn't in the government, but he still was empowered by a secret Reagan executive order to plan essentially for a suspension of the Constitution.
[03:13:07.828 --> 03:13:11.470]  It's really remarkable the two of them kept on planning.
[03:13:12.488 --> 03:13:26.356]  Right through the 90s, and in the second half of the 90s, neither Cheney nor Rumsfeld was in the government, and you had a Democratic president who, according to Andrew Coburn, didn't have only the vaguest idea of what was going on.
[03:13:26.356 --> 03:13:38.242]  They were planning for all these big changes we've seen since 9-11, and neither of them was in the government, and this was all empowered by a Reagan executive order back in 1981.
[03:13:39.710 --> 03:13:58.581]  So there is a good way of seeing how what's going on on the surface is really being subordinated to other forces not visible that have only the flimsiest of constitutional authorizations that trump the Constitution.
[03:13:58.581 --> 03:14:02.343]  Because, you know, we've seen the suspension of habeas corpus.
[03:14:02.343 --> 03:14:06.245]  We've seen the preparations for martial law in a very big way.
[03:14:06.869 --> 03:14:15.532]  And all of these major, major changes were not debated through Congress or even through the normal executive.
[03:14:15.532 --> 03:14:25.175]  It was done by what you like to call a shadow government, a special committee that was secretly authorized by Reagan back in 1981.
[03:14:29.013 --> 03:14:29.273]  Sure.
[03:14:29.273 --> 03:14:31.816]  You want me to go on a bit more?
[03:14:31.816 --> 03:14:36.761]  Yeah, continue, because now the deep state is openly becoming the entire state.
[03:14:36.761 --> 03:14:48.174]  It looks like Obama's lockstep with PDD 51, John Warren Defense Authorization Act, the announcement of 20,000 battle-hardened troops beyond the streets of America, suddenly Marines are at DWI checkpoints.
[03:14:49.110 --> 03:15:07.937]  We're putting liaison officers into the police departments, and Congress isn't allowed to see PD-51, though the cover sheet basically says the President's a dictator, and now, I wanted to get your take on a few weeks ago, the John Yoo memos come out, one good thing, that President Obama's done, and it says what we already knew.
[03:15:07.937 --> 03:15:13.179]  They wanted to get rid of free speech, they said the President's basically a dictator, and that that's constitutional.
[03:15:13.179 --> 03:15:13.519]  Go ahead.
[03:15:14.212 --> 03:15:14.952]  Yes.
[03:15:14.952 --> 03:15:29.802]  Well, you know, there's a bunch of... I'm not alone in being upset about constitutional, what they call continuity of government, COG, which I insist we should call change of government.
[03:15:29.802 --> 03:15:37.046]  We are in, still, in a state of emergency, which was declared officially three days after 9-11.
[03:15:38.342 --> 03:15:52.230]  There is actually a statute that requires Congress to review every proclamation of an emergency within six months, and to decide whether to allow it to stand or to get rid of it.
[03:15:52.230 --> 03:16:02.396]  And for about two years now, I've been appealing to the Democrats in Congress to do their statutory requirement and conduct that review.
[03:16:02.396 --> 03:16:04.237]  And since Obama was elected,
[03:16:05.304 --> 03:16:20.370]  Dan Hamburg, he's a former congressman, and I have written to the Obama White House, and we've written to Nancy Pelosi, and we've used all the back channels that we know of, which are not very many in my case.
[03:16:20.370 --> 03:16:24.091]  I've written to somebody who speaks to Dennis Kucinich.
[03:16:24.091 --> 03:16:31.074]  I think all these people do what the law says you have to do and look at the state of emergency
[03:16:31.679 --> 03:16:35.461]  And either publicly affirm it or get rid of it.
[03:16:35.461 --> 03:16:46.406]  In that case, that would sweep away the foundation for all these secret memos which Congress ought to be able to see but hasn't been allowed to look at.
[03:16:46.406 --> 03:16:49.128]  Let me bring a microcosm up of that.
[03:16:49.128 --> 03:16:53.250]  The Delta Force has been operating really since the 60s, but they publicly founded it in 1980, in December.
[03:16:57.219 --> 03:17:08.689]  And we heard this week from Sy Hersh and MSNBC with Oberman, a secret death squad operating in the U.S., spying but killing people overseas, outside the CIA's control.
[03:17:08.689 --> 03:17:11.231]  And then it mentioned it was the Delta Force.
[03:17:11.231 --> 03:17:12.853]  Well, Obama's continuing that.
[03:17:12.853 --> 03:17:14.254]  It was going on before Bush.
[03:17:14.254 --> 03:17:21.320]  By making it just about Bush, people think, oh, this is all over, but that's the deep... No, no, it's older than Bush, and we still have it.
[03:17:21.320 --> 03:17:22.101]  It's JSOC.
[03:17:22.871 --> 03:17:40.755]  And, uh, I've been around for a while, so I remember, you know, I actually went to Washington to investigate these things, worked for a think tank in 1987, and we were very considerate about this Joint Special Operations Command, which the Delta Force is under.
[03:17:40.755 --> 03:17:49.277]  Uh, that was set up in the 1980s, and they were doing all kinds of shady things then, and I was particularly trying to
[03:17:50.240 --> 03:18:02.571]  Uh, pinpoint or pin down the rumors that we kept hearing over and over that this had to do with the flow of drugs into the country, which was, you know, a tremendous problem then and still is.
[03:18:02.571 --> 03:18:04.272]  It was really acute then.
[03:18:04.272 --> 03:18:14.581]  Uh, we, you know, we had the cocaine epidemics that turned into the crack epidemic and it was so much of it was as a result of what the CIA was doing.
[03:18:14.972 --> 03:18:41.277]  It's now official that in the first year that the CIA started operations in Afghanistan back in 1980, within months, certainly within that year, we went from virtually no heroin coming from that part of the world to the United States, to 40% of our heroin coming from that part of the world to the United States.
[03:18:41.877 --> 03:18:55.690]  No, and it's very striking right now that we can't get the people who are in Afghanistan to target the big drug lords.
[03:18:55.690 --> 03:18:59.994]  Drug refineries, they process the heroin right there in Afghanistan.
[03:19:00.760 --> 03:19:03.261]  In Afghanistan, and the...
[03:19:18.246 --> 03:19:22.707]  The British and the Americans see it differently because most of that heroin is going to Europe and to Britain.
[03:19:41.926 --> 03:19:42.527]  Yeah, stay there.
[03:19:42.527 --> 03:19:50.473]  Let's continue with the Deep State, Obama, who's behind him, and then let's get into some of the groups that you write about and talk about.
[03:19:50.473 --> 03:19:55.578]  Specifically, I've had listeners ask me about those that are controlling right-wing groups and left-wing groups.
[03:19:55.578 --> 03:19:59.401]  So, some more of the structure of the shadow government.
[03:19:59.401 --> 03:19:59.821]  Stay with us.
[03:19:59.821 --> 03:20:00.762]  Peter Del Scott's our guest.
[03:20:01.963 --> 03:20:03.324]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:20:03.324 --> 03:20:09.887]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:20:09.887 --> 03:20:13.649]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:20:13.649 --> 03:20:22.213]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:20:22.213 --> 03:20:26.055]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[03:20:26.055 --> 03:20:31.698]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods
[03:20:36.883 --> 03:20:39.045]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:21:05.464 --> 03:21:08.306]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.306 --> 03:21:14.189]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.189 --> 03:21:20.692]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.692 --> 03:21:22.673]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.673 --> 03:21:25.115]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:25.115 --> 03:21:34.860]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[03:21:35.325 --> 03:21:38.306]  That's fascist.
[03:21:38.306 --> 03:21:39.966]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.966 --> 03:21:41.827]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:41.827 --> 03:21:48.728]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:58.571]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.571 --> 03:21:59.771]  The people strike back.
[03:22:02.199 --> 03:22:04.641]  Peter Krashnobel here from Midas Resources.
[03:22:04.641 --> 03:22:07.644]  Are you concerned about uncontrollable government spending?
[03:22:07.644 --> 03:22:10.127]  A banking system on the verge of collapse?
[03:22:10.127 --> 03:22:12.569]  Banks on the edge of being nationalized?
[03:22:12.569 --> 03:22:15.052]  Wall Street and continuous free fall?
[03:22:15.052 --> 03:22:17.334]  Scandal after scandal with hedge fund companies?
[03:22:17.887 --> 03:22:23.268]  If protecting your hard-earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[03:22:23.268 --> 03:22:26.349]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver.
[03:22:26.349 --> 03:22:35.271]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest-running fiat currency in the history of mankind.
[03:22:35.271 --> 03:22:38.832]  Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years.
[03:22:38.832 --> 03:22:41.552]  Contact me, Peter Kronschnabel, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:22:45.673 --> 03:22:47.656]  Once again, that's Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:22:47.656 --> 03:22:50.058]  While you can still purchase gold with paper.
[03:22:50.058 --> 03:22:51.040]  That is 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:23:01.869 --> 03:23:02.990]  Spring is here.
[03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:03.950]  Growing season.
[03:23:03.950 --> 03:23:06.152]  The economy is not getting any better.
[03:23:06.152 --> 03:23:07.873]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[03:23:07.873 --> 03:23:08.834]  Think about it.
[03:23:08.834 --> 03:23:12.936]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[03:23:12.936 --> 03:23:16.679]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[03:23:16.679 --> 03:23:18.580]  The country is running out of food.
[03:23:18.580 --> 03:23:21.402]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[03:23:21.402 --> 03:23:31.589]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you
[03:23:31.769 --> 03:23:32.089]  I think so.
[03:24:04.699 --> 03:24:05.660]  We are back live.
[03:24:05.660 --> 03:24:10.964]  Professor Peter L. Scott, author, researcher, is our guest.
[03:24:10.964 --> 03:24:13.046]  This is a short segment.
[03:24:13.046 --> 03:24:16.008]  Peter, from your deep research, let's just cut right to the chase.
[03:24:32.961 --> 03:24:38.382]  Well, let me begin with a quote from Franklin Roosevelt back in 1933, which I believe is still true
[03:24:59.568 --> 03:25:05.189]  And very visibly demonstrated in the last six months with the bailouts.
[03:25:05.189 --> 03:25:21.333]  This was a private letter of Roosevelt to a close friend, Colonel House, and he said, the real truth is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.
[03:25:22.202 --> 03:25:30.787]  Now, you know, I used to teach political science, and we never taught this, and I left political science because they don't address this fundamental fact.
[03:25:30.787 --> 03:25:35.130]  So, you know, a Marxist would say, ah, yes, there's a ruling class.
[03:25:35.130 --> 03:25:50.799]  But I think the Marxists don't understand it properly either, because he said in the larger centers, New York, of course, was the dominant center, and still is to some extent.
[03:25:51.354 --> 03:26:12.803]  And that's why I was talking about the Council on Foreign Relations before, but we've seen a lot of new wealth come up in Houston and Dallas and Los Angeles, and in 1980 there was the creation of a group which was consciously designed to combat the influence of the CFR, and that's called the Council
[03:26:13.924 --> 03:26:15.925]  ...for national policy.
[03:26:15.925 --> 03:26:31.855]  They resented the connections of the banks in New York to the international globe, global financial network, and they wanted one which would be more nationalistic in its approaches.
[03:26:31.855 --> 03:26:41.240]  And the people who financed that creation of the CNP, as we call it, as opposed to CFR, are people like Richard Mellon Scaife,
[03:26:41.758 --> 03:26:44.919]  We simultaneously financed the Model Majority.
[03:26:44.919 --> 03:26:47.800]  The Model Majority was not a grassroots organization.
[03:26:47.800 --> 03:26:58.944]  It was very much a top-down organization funded by Paul Wehrich and by Richard Melon Scaife, which really meant that the Moonies were putting money into it.
[03:26:58.944 --> 03:27:01.265]  It was not a totally American institution.
[03:27:01.733 --> 03:27:03.774]  It had its own international connection.
[03:27:21.124 --> 03:27:24.665]  That that's their way to co-opt conservative movements and control it.
[03:27:24.665 --> 03:27:28.506]  I mean, are you saying the Moonies and groups like this are at the top?
[03:27:28.506 --> 03:27:45.090]  Because we see the international bankers openly taking everything over right now, and I just see liberal control arms, Ford Foundation over the liberals, and Rockefeller Foundation and others, and then the group you're talking about and some others that are, you know, trying to control and influence what would be seen as the right wing.
[03:27:46.226 --> 03:27:49.688]  Well, you know, we live in an imperfect world.
[03:27:49.688 --> 03:27:58.472]  By the way, when I listen to all those anti-Obama ads, I think we have to see what Obama's going to do.
[03:27:58.472 --> 03:28:08.037]  Because, you know, in 1932, when Roosevelt was elected, a lot of people would have said, ah, there's the New York ruling class asserting themselves again.
[03:28:09.179 --> 03:28:17.781]  Roosevelt, although there was a limit to what he could do, certainly did enough to mightily offend the financial elements.
[03:28:17.781 --> 03:28:27.103]  And we do know that fascist interest in the McCormick-Dickson committees covered this, tried to overthrow him and Smedley Butler blew the whistle, so that does show there's infighting.
[03:28:27.103 --> 03:28:28.663]  Smedley Butler, exactly.
[03:28:28.663 --> 03:28:33.264]  And those were, you know, DuPont and Morgan people behind Smedley Butler.
[03:28:34.072 --> 03:28:40.217]  I wonder if everybody in this audience knows that there was an attempt to mount a military coup in 1935.
[03:28:40.217 --> 03:28:42.238]  It didn't go anywhere.
[03:28:42.238 --> 03:28:49.184]  This is a much healthier country, actually, than one might think, just by reading the headlines right now.
[03:28:49.184 --> 03:29:01.473]  We have some very major problems, but I'm prepared to wait and see what Obama's going to do, but also I'm quite certain in my own mind that Obama got where he got, because
[03:29:02.082 --> 03:29:10.827]  Some of the moneyed elements in America backed him from the very beginning, and I think we can talk specifically about the Pritzker family.
[03:29:10.827 --> 03:29:13.069]  I've written about it.
[03:29:13.069 --> 03:29:29.319]  If you go to my website, www.peterdalescott.net, I have some rather nasty things to say about the Pritzkers, and yet there was Penny Pritzker, who was the treasurer of the Obama campaign, until her connection to the subprime
[03:29:30.012 --> 03:29:31.633]  We're on the march.
[03:29:31.633 --> 03:29:33.714]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:33.714 --> 03:29:35.915]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.307 --> 03:30:05.832]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:30:05.832 --> 03:30:11.239]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:30:11.239 --> 03:30:15.945]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:30:17.227 --> 03:30:27.910]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:30:27.910 --> 03:30:33.672]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:30:33.672 --> 03:30:39.954]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:30:39.954 --> 03:30:40.974]  What about you?
[03:30:40.974 --> 03:30:42.915]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[03:31:02.162 --> 03:31:07.984]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:07.984 --> 03:31:14.967]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.555 --> 03:31:22.139]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.139 --> 03:31:24.100]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.100 --> 03:31:26.621]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.621 --> 03:31:37.587]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.189 --> 03:31:39.850]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.850 --> 03:31:41.711]  It's about a one world government.
[03:31:41.711 --> 03:31:48.614]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:31:56.878 --> 03:31:58.459]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.459 --> 03:31:59.640]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.479 --> 03:32:09.950]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:16.459]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist
[03:32:16.479 --> 03:32:16.859]  I don't know.
[03:32:35.356 --> 03:32:35.736]  I think so.
[03:33:07.785 --> 03:33:11.927]  Okay, Professor Peter Del Scott, researcher on what he calls the Deep State.
[03:33:11.927 --> 03:33:18.711]  Continue, you were getting into CFR, CMP, different management systems for the shadow government.
[03:33:18.711 --> 03:33:19.852]  Please continue.
[03:33:19.852 --> 03:33:27.476]  Well, first of all, that kind of split would be there with or without the CFR and the CMP.
[03:33:27.476 --> 03:33:33.640]  You go back before the war, you in the days of the National Association of Manufacturers
[03:33:34.096 --> 03:33:48.143]  They represented what you might call a homegrown industry that was not interested in exports, was interested in the local economy, and was very mistrustful of the banking connections in New York.
[03:33:48.143 --> 03:34:03.711]  And it's out of the NAM, the National Association of Manufacturers, that you got the John Birch Society, which was, you know, it was always depicted in the, what you might call the CFR-controlled big media as being a kooky organization.
[03:34:04.127 --> 03:34:11.332]  But they were powerful, because they had roots not just in what was left of the NAM, but also in the military.
[03:34:11.332 --> 03:34:13.513]  They were at quite a high level in the military.
[03:34:13.513 --> 03:34:20.878]  People like General Walker and so on were indoctrinating their troops with John Birch material.
[03:34:20.878 --> 03:34:22.940]  And we have the legacy of that today.
[03:34:22.940 --> 03:34:30.905]  That tradition is what produced the CNP, the Council on National Policy, in Dallas in 1980.
[03:34:30.905 --> 03:34:33.247]  You mentioned yourself, The Hunt.
[03:34:34.097 --> 03:34:39.819]  Let's take the current generation, where they're dying off now.
[03:34:39.819 --> 03:34:46.042]  Nelson Bunker Hunt had financed the John Birch Society.
[03:34:46.042 --> 03:34:57.727]  He had paid for the ad that attacked Kennedy on the day he came to Dallas in 1963, that fateful day, and he was one of the big sources of money for
[03:34:58.757 --> 03:35:00.698]  The Council on National Policy.
[03:35:00.698 --> 03:35:14.507]  In other words, Richard Mellonscape, who's a grandson of Andrew Mellon, the very wealthy... The Mellons were extremely wealthy from Gulf oil, but they also controlled Alcoa and... Steele, yeah.
[03:35:14.507 --> 03:35:17.588]  ...the Bank.
[03:35:17.588 --> 03:35:24.493]  You have these different powerful groups so that you can't just... And this is where I disagree with Mellonchonsky, for example.
[03:35:24.493 --> 03:35:26.734]  He thinks that America's a great big system
[03:35:27.538 --> 03:35:40.510]  Let's use the United States as an engine for their operations globally.
[03:35:40.510 --> 03:35:43.312]  We were already incredibly wealthy before these elites take over.
[03:35:43.312 --> 03:35:46.215]  They always act like America stole everything it's got.
[03:35:46.215 --> 03:35:51.439]  No, really, we've seen our, in my opinion, long decline since we became an empire.
[03:35:51.439 --> 03:35:52.320]  Do you agree with that statement?
[03:35:53.483 --> 03:35:54.463]  I can't assess it.
[03:35:54.463 --> 03:35:57.384]  I mean, there are visible sources of decline.
[03:35:57.384 --> 03:35:58.805]  Well, I mean, let's assess this.
[03:35:58.805 --> 03:36:00.545]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:36:00.545 --> 03:36:11.828]  Well, I'll just say, you know, it got said, you know, a little earlier, we've been living on a fiety currency ever since Nixon went off the gold standard.
[03:36:11.828 --> 03:36:19.551]  But, you know, I think that's where there's an argument, and it would be a CNP argument, for maintaining a very strong military.
[03:36:21.178 --> 03:36:21.838]  We're good to go.
[03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:35.772]  As the currency that oil deals... No, I understand all that.
[03:36:35.772 --> 03:36:47.556]  You know, my whole issue is, other people call in and ask me, you know what the CNP is, and I've heard of it, and I know it's a bunch of kind of fake right-wingers that, you know, meet and have these dinners and things, and I know there's a lot of... Well, I don't think they're fake.
[03:36:47.556 --> 03:36:51.457]  I think, you know, if they're fake, who are the real right-wingers?
[03:36:51.457 --> 03:36:55.519]  Well, see, I mean, I'm past this whole left-right thing.
[03:36:55.519 --> 03:37:00.101]  I see things as tyranny or liberty, and my whole issue with this is,
[03:37:01.371 --> 03:37:16.233]  I see the list of people that are involved in this group and I see them also involved in a lot of the other major groups and it's clear the international banking cartel is the top of the pyramid and I know that the Hunts and people because I remember reading stuff on the UT website there was a
[03:37:17.094 --> 03:37:19.256]  My take on that is, Alex, and you know
[03:37:44.678 --> 03:37:54.247]  I mean, part of me thinks the way you do, but part of me thinks that in order to be visible in this struggle, you have to be powerful.
[03:37:54.247 --> 03:37:59.793]  And in order to be powerful, you have to have connections to the wealthy in this country.
[03:37:59.793 --> 03:38:09.442]  And once you start developing those connections, you start becoming co-opted into this whole system whereby wealth controls the politics of the country.
[03:38:09.861 --> 03:38:11.762]  So a true liberty party.
[03:38:11.762 --> 03:38:23.649]  You know, we've had some real libertarians in this country like Murray Rothbard and so on, but most people never heard of them because they, and even he, had wealthy connections.
[03:38:23.649 --> 03:38:29.653]  Somebody like me, I swear to God, I don't have any connection to wealth.
[03:38:29.653 --> 03:38:33.475]  I also have no visibility in this country except on your show.
[03:38:34.499 --> 03:38:44.105]  Because to be visible in this country, you somehow have to fit into this system, whether you're at the CFR side of it or the left.
[03:38:44.105 --> 03:38:46.786]  But the internet is changing that.
[03:38:46.786 --> 03:38:47.687]  Yes, it is.
[03:38:47.687 --> 03:38:48.828]  I mean, that's why we exist.
[03:38:48.828 --> 03:38:51.849]  But I'm just trying to understand, because I really respect your research.
[03:38:51.849 --> 03:38:56.972]  You know, you're absolutely right about the Delta Force and the command above it.
[03:38:56.972 --> 03:38:58.113]  Everything I read from you
[03:39:00.074 --> 03:39:08.462]  About 98% of it is stuff I already discovered on my own, and then you take it many times a level deeper, and then I research it and find out you're accurate.
[03:39:08.462 --> 03:39:14.588]  So I really respect you, and I'm trying to learn your perspective on this.
[03:39:14.588 --> 03:39:15.749]  My whole issue is...
[03:39:18.527 --> 03:39:19.868]  Okay, let me just address that.
[03:39:19.868 --> 03:39:21.568]  The Hunt brother that George W. Bush is close to
[03:39:45.084 --> 03:39:50.948]  Is the Ray Hunt, who doesn't really share the politics of his two brothers.
[03:39:50.948 --> 03:39:53.030]  They're half-brothers, by the way.
[03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:59.375]  He's the son from a later marriage, and I would not classify Ray Hunt as being CNP.
[03:39:59.375 --> 03:40:10.322]  I would classify him as being Texas mega-rich, the Sunbelt faction in the ruling class.
[03:40:10.322 --> 03:40:13.205]  George W. Bush, I think, is mostly indebted to...
[03:40:14.289 --> 03:40:29.757]  You should, Bob, people should, if they're interested in this, get my friend Russ Baker's book, Family of Secrets, and he goes at great length into who funded George W. Bush's little oil company, Arbusto, as it grew and grew and grew.
[03:40:29.757 --> 03:40:34.220]  But isn't that CIA connected, and then Skull and Bones, I thought, is Bush's main power.
[03:40:34.662 --> 03:40:37.765]  Well, yeah, but you know, there's a lot of Texas in Skull and Bones.
[03:40:37.765 --> 03:40:38.426]  No, I know.
[03:40:38.426 --> 03:40:45.052]  I'm not... So, I mean, you really... Are you saying you believe that the C&P thing is the top of the pyramid?
[03:40:45.052 --> 03:40:46.874]  No.
[03:40:46.874 --> 03:40:48.416]  Actually, I don't think it's a pyramid.
[03:40:48.416 --> 03:40:49.317]  Let's start there.
[03:40:49.317 --> 03:40:54.842]  I think these things go up into a kind of... Bipolar?
[03:40:54.842 --> 03:40:55.183]  Multi-polar?
[03:40:55.183 --> 03:40:56.464]  Bipolar area where there is...
[03:40:57.870 --> 03:41:01.872]  So much infighting going on that nobody's at the top.
[03:41:01.872 --> 03:41:10.696]  And specifically, Alex, I think one of the places you and I disagree most is that we both think this is a basically healthy country.
[03:41:10.696 --> 03:41:21.481]  But where we differ is that you try to localize the source of the evil in the international bankers and something outside the country.
[03:41:21.481 --> 03:41:22.081]  I don't think
[03:41:22.694 --> 03:41:33.258]  I think that the international banking system, as it's called, that we now have was first of all the creation of Britain, and then after that, of the United States.
[03:41:33.258 --> 03:41:37.680]  The hardcore of the international banking system is the US and England.
[03:41:37.680 --> 03:41:38.900]  England, America.
[03:41:38.900 --> 03:41:40.261]  London and New York.
[03:41:40.885 --> 03:41:47.208]  And we cannot blame everything that's wrong... Peter, Peter, you don't... No, no, you misunderstand my position.
[03:41:47.208 --> 03:42:00.834]  I mean, I go off the... I agree it's the Anglo-American establishment, the United States and England are the international banking cartel or the dominant force, but it's allied with some European factions, so I'm not disagreeing with you there.
[03:42:00.834 --> 03:42:03.196]  Well, how about the moral tone of it?
[03:42:03.196 --> 03:42:06.217]  Because I don't see them as being inherently evil.
[03:42:06.618 --> 03:42:09.842]  For example, I hate war.
[03:42:09.842 --> 03:42:14.647]  I've spent my life fighting the wars that have happened in my adulthood.
[03:42:15.188 --> 03:42:23.674]  But when the Anglo-American establishment united to stop Hitler, I think that was probably a good thing.
[03:42:23.674 --> 03:42:32.660]  What about the Milner Group wanting to fund a fascist movement in Germany to counterbalance the communist move, and then you have here in the U.S.
[03:42:32.660 --> 03:42:39.205]  all the big, and that goes back to the right-wing faction, trying to fund Hitler and him funding them here, so again we come back
[03:42:39.665 --> 03:42:45.408]  But these are splits which separated John Foster Dulles from his brother Alan Dulles.
[03:42:45.408 --> 03:42:45.849]  Sure, sure.
[03:42:45.849 --> 03:42:59.837]  I'm not saying it's a... Look, look, it's just like in The Godfather, you know, that's a composite of true stories where you've got the 12 families meeting around the table and they kill each other and they fight over turf but they don't go out and blow the whistle on their rackets to the general public.
[03:43:00.197 --> 03:43:05.501]  So obviously, it's not one, you know, everything perfectly scientifically oiled together.
[03:43:05.501 --> 03:43:15.049]  It's these big corrupt elites and their think tanks and their systems of control and their propaganda arms just expanding power and destroying the middle class and impoverishing the planet.
[03:43:15.049 --> 03:43:18.932]  I mean, it's like, you know, Mexico's one elite, but it works with the U.S.
[03:43:18.932 --> 03:43:19.613]  elite.
[03:43:19.613 --> 03:43:21.094]  I mean, so that's what I believe.
[03:43:21.960 --> 03:43:42.164]  Well, let's talk a bit about Mexico, because now you have essentially a dozen or so super-rich people, many of whom have got rich on the drug traffic, and they really do work as a unit and meet together to pool their money to back a candidate for the next president.
[03:43:42.164 --> 03:43:44.605]  That's not my model for America.
[03:43:44.605 --> 03:43:51.686]  I think that there is more confusion than that in America, and that's why we have, you know, let's face it, we have a healthier
[03:43:52.470 --> 03:43:55.632]  A political society in America than you have in Mexico.
[03:43:55.632 --> 03:44:01.276]  And that goes back to the separation of powers that the founders set up to tie down dominant men.
[03:44:01.276 --> 03:44:02.176]  Hear, hear.
[03:44:02.176 --> 03:44:04.338]  And that is very threatened right now.
[03:44:04.338 --> 03:44:13.864]  That is what I've, on my website, I've been doing these various things to see, and you know where you brought up the John Yoo memos and so on.
[03:44:13.864 --> 03:44:18.807]  I think to get to restoration of real separation of powers and
[03:44:19.626 --> 03:44:24.511]  A restoration of constitutional primacy over everything else.
[03:44:24.511 --> 03:44:33.939]  We have to undo this idea that we're at war against terrorists who are as powerful as we are.
[03:44:33.939 --> 03:44:42.707]  Our Constitution is our best defense and somehow we've got to get Congress to reassert its primacy and to reassert their rights and to end this
[03:44:43.405 --> 03:44:44.045]  I don't think so.
[03:44:55.649 --> 03:45:20.260]  My dad called me one morning, he saw it too, a separate year, and they go, uh, you know, Madam Speaker, Speaker, I have a message from the President of the United States, and he brings in the message of the emergency, and then they pass it through, or they agree to it, so you're right, we've been living under the state of emergency for a long time, and we've gotta... Alex, you know, I may be wrong on this, because I haven't really researched it, but I was going to write about that, and someone assured me
[03:45:21.119 --> 03:45:22.260]  I don't know.
[03:45:34.884 --> 03:45:40.047]  The national state of emergency that we've had since... No, no, I've seen them bring it in.
[03:45:40.047 --> 03:45:44.729]  No, no, I understand separately they call it martial law in Congress when some of the rules are suspended.
[03:45:44.729 --> 03:45:52.714]  I mean, there's a lot of different systems, but then separately... But we're getting martial law in this country and very elaborate preparations for it.
[03:45:52.714 --> 03:45:58.717]  And it's not just this country because Canada's army now is pretty well melded into the American one.
[03:45:58.717 --> 03:46:04.320]  And Canada is also... We never had a Posse Comus Tattoos Act in Canada.
[03:46:04.847 --> 03:46:08.670]  But we do have a tradition of doing things through Parliament.
[03:46:08.670 --> 03:46:11.071]  Well, Peter, briefly, briefly.
[03:46:11.071 --> 03:46:11.892]  Sure, sure.
[03:46:11.892 --> 03:46:13.653]  And I keep interrupting because we have limited time here.
[03:46:13.653 --> 03:46:14.734]  I'm going to have to have you back up.
[03:46:14.734 --> 03:46:17.176]  We'll do it maybe for a couple hours and really break all this down.
[03:46:17.176 --> 03:46:19.958]  Specifically, I've had listeners ask me about it.
[03:46:19.958 --> 03:46:22.179]  I know some about the CNP.
[03:46:22.179 --> 03:46:25.442]  Tell me who's in that now and what it's doing.
[03:46:25.442 --> 03:46:27.903]  Oh, you know, I'm an old man.
[03:46:27.903 --> 03:46:30.645]  I can tell you who was in it at the beginning.
[03:46:30.645 --> 03:46:32.246]  It was the Coons family.
[03:46:32.246 --> 03:46:34.408]  It was the Richard Mellon scape.
[03:46:35.066 --> 03:46:51.181]  It was, um, there is a website, you know, if people have a computer, they can Google for Council on National Policy and you'll get a very big website that gives you all the members that are known.
[03:46:51.181 --> 03:46:54.904]  By the way, it's very secret.
[03:46:54.904 --> 03:46:59.809]  They don't publish any of their findings, as opposed to the Council on Foreign Relations,
[03:47:00.379 --> 03:47:07.305]  Which runs, has a magazine, Foreign Affairs, and is always publishing papers on this and that.
[03:47:07.305 --> 03:47:17.073]  This other thing, they talk among themselves and we can only guess, but outsiders are being able to reconstitute a kind of membership list.
[03:47:17.603 --> 03:47:23.105]  It's a lot of the people who are involved in the radical religious right.
[03:47:23.105 --> 03:47:25.485]  The Blackwater guy's in it too, isn't he?
[03:47:25.485 --> 03:47:26.806]  I think so, yes.
[03:47:26.806 --> 03:47:32.628]  And he's now converted to Catholicism, and people are saying... How does the Catholic Church in Israel play into this?
[03:47:32.628 --> 03:47:33.968]  Because I get that question all the time.
[03:47:33.968 --> 03:47:35.288]  What's your view on those groups?
[03:47:35.288 --> 03:47:40.890]  Well, again, the Catholic Church is very much a mixture of different forces.
[03:47:40.890 --> 03:47:43.591]  You know, there have been, I think, the leading
[03:47:44.382 --> 03:47:44.583]  I don't
[03:47:58.626 --> 03:47:59.326]  You know what Alex?
[03:47:59.326 --> 03:48:01.687]  I think any big organization is going to have a lot of corruption in it.
[03:48:01.687 --> 03:48:03.428]  That includes the American government and the Catholic Church.
[03:48:19.113 --> 03:48:21.634]  They also can have a lot of good in them.
[03:48:21.634 --> 03:48:26.776]  I just want your view, because listeners, they obsess on groups.
[03:48:26.776 --> 03:48:29.277]  So if people want that, we'll do it, and I respect you.
[03:48:29.277 --> 03:48:31.618]  I want your view on CMP, Catholic Church.
[03:48:31.618 --> 03:48:33.178]  What about Israel?
[03:48:33.178 --> 03:48:35.339]  Where is it in the power structure from your research?
[03:48:35.339 --> 03:48:46.243]  Well, Israel at this point is so embattled that, you know, it began as a quite progressive, left-of-center, secular state.
[03:48:46.818 --> 03:48:50.761]  It's become completely changed over the years.
[03:48:50.761 --> 03:48:54.224]  The disaster for Israel was in 1967.
[03:48:54.224 --> 03:48:58.948]  Whether or not they were right temporarily to occupy the West Bank.
[03:48:58.948 --> 03:49:06.915]  They should have got out of it immediately and a lot of very sane heads at the top of Israel's government said we must do that.
[03:49:06.915 --> 03:49:11.558]  Well they haven't and since then they've been in a virtual state of siege.
[03:49:11.558 --> 03:49:15.662]  And I was in Israel a little over a year ago
[03:49:16.261 --> 03:49:32.045]  Everybody I met, individually, they were charming people, but their ideas, they fear peace at this point more than they fear war, because they know if they have peace, they're going to have to give that land back, and they don't know how to do that.
[03:49:32.045 --> 03:49:33.685]  So it's a perpetual state of war.
[03:49:33.685 --> 03:49:37.466]  But so are we, to some extent.
[03:49:37.466 --> 03:49:43.267]  There was a right-winger called Harry Elmer Barnes in the 50s, and he wrote a book
[03:49:43.672 --> 03:49:46.133]  Perpetual war for perpetual peace.
[03:50:00.578 --> 03:50:04.579]  And we have to invent enemies for it, like Osama Bin Laden in a cave.
[03:50:22.643 --> 03:50:34.390]  Relationship between the Likudniks and the CNP people, and they are in a lot of key areas of government, and I agree, it's a way over representation.
[03:50:34.390 --> 03:50:50.500]  And some of that sheer madness, because of what's in the book of Revelation, you know, that these Christian right people who are trying to breed a red heifer, because that's what in the Old Testament is going to be a sign of the Messiah.
[03:50:51.592 --> 03:50:56.353]  This is what you call rational representation of financial interest.
[03:50:56.353 --> 03:50:57.474]  Peter, we've got a break.
[03:50:57.474 --> 03:50:58.374]  The break's going to cut you off.
[03:50:58.374 --> 03:50:58.974]  Final segment.
[03:50:58.974 --> 03:51:02.055]  Peter Del Scott, stay with us.
[03:51:02.055 --> 03:51:03.355]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:51:03.355 --> 03:51:08.936]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:51:08.936 --> 03:51:13.958]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:51:13.958 --> 03:51:14.438]  It's true.
[03:51:14.438 --> 03:51:18.979]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:51:19.542 --> 03:51:24.765]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:51:24.765 --> 03:51:27.066]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:51:27.066 --> 03:51:31.869]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:51:31.869 --> 03:51:32.989]  And here's the best part.
[03:51:32.989 --> 03:51:36.071]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:51:36.071 --> 03:51:39.693]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:51:39.693 --> 03:51:42.875]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:51:42.875 --> 03:51:45.096]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:51:45.096 --> 03:51:46.016]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:51:51.031 --> 03:51:53.894]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:51:53.894 --> 03:51:58.718]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:51:58.718 --> 03:52:02.661]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:52:02.661 --> 03:52:07.906]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.676 --> 03:52:14.560]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.560 --> 03:52:21.064]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.064 --> 03:52:23.045]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.045 --> 03:52:25.486]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.486 --> 03:52:36.393]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.664 --> 03:52:40.345]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.345 --> 03:52:42.206]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:42.206 --> 03:52:49.111]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.111 --> 03:52:57.376]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.376 --> 03:52:58.957]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.957 --> 03:53:00.138]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.960 --> 03:53:05.383]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:53:05.383 --> 03:53:09.646]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:53:09.646 --> 03:53:17.613]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[03:53:17.893 --> 03:53:18.313]  We're good to go.
[03:53:47.813 --> 03:53:48.655]  I think so.
[03:54:04.153 --> 03:54:05.613]  Alright, we're basically out of time.
[03:54:05.613 --> 03:54:11.235]  I'm sorry I didn't have time to get to these calls, but I wanted to give Peter Del Scott as much time for us to discuss and go back and forth here.
[03:54:11.235 --> 03:54:13.235]  We'll have to have him back on as soon as he can do it.
[03:54:13.235 --> 03:54:15.095]  I know he's a busy man.
[03:54:15.095 --> 03:54:16.816]  PeterDelScott.net.
[03:54:16.816 --> 03:54:18.376]  PeterDelScott.net is the website.
[03:54:18.376 --> 03:54:26.378]  A lot of great books, very informative information, interesting perspective, and that's what I try to get is all views and perspectives here to get a clearer picture of what's going on in the world.
[03:54:26.378 --> 03:54:28.358]  Got about two minutes left, sir.
[03:54:28.358 --> 03:54:29.559]  Any closing information?
[03:54:29.559 --> 03:54:30.419]  You know, you're saying don't
[03:54:30.959 --> 03:54:32.400]  Judge Obama yet.
[03:54:32.400 --> 03:54:38.182]  I mean, I've seen, he says he's not doing CEO bonuses, but he writes a loophole in it.
[03:54:38.182 --> 03:54:39.443]  He says he's not going to hire lobbyists.
[03:54:39.443 --> 03:54:40.644]  That's all he does.
[03:54:40.644 --> 03:54:49.908]  All these Wall Street and banking people, all the Bush people, keeping the key neocon in there, you know, as Secretary of Defense.
[03:54:49.908 --> 03:54:52.209]  Talk about, you know, the CNP or whatever.
[03:54:52.209 --> 03:54:58.852]  I mean, it just, Obama, bad news in my book, and I've done the research, but you want to talk about that in closing?
[03:54:59.963 --> 03:55:14.332]  Well, what I'd like to go back to what you said, you know, is now we have the Internet, you can be heard, you're a real force in this country, and even I can, readers can reach me through my website and they learn about my books.
[03:55:14.332 --> 03:55:28.662]  The most important thing for the future of this country is to preserve the Internet, because there is, the mass media are more centralized now than they were 40 years ago, but it was a problem even then.
[03:55:29.252 --> 03:55:32.194]  And there's so many important things they just won't talk about.
[03:55:32.194 --> 03:55:32.754]  Yes.
[03:55:32.754 --> 03:55:39.037]  And we're talking about, you know, the populist reaction to the bank bailout.
[03:55:39.037 --> 03:55:50.083]  The New York Times writes about that as if this is kind of a dangerous phenomenon, whereas I think it's the health of the country that is protesting these bailouts.
[03:55:50.083 --> 03:55:53.845]  And so we need the Internet to do it, and we risk losing the Internet.
[03:55:53.845 --> 03:55:54.345]  That's right.
[03:55:54.987 --> 03:56:02.072]  And the COG, you know, they've had war games in which they were targeting bloggers.
[03:56:02.072 --> 03:56:05.074]  That was the official point of the program.
[03:56:05.074 --> 03:56:11.019]  They admit they have the Pentagon people out propagandizing on the web and the millions of dollars' worth.
[03:56:11.019 --> 03:56:11.399]  Right.
[03:56:11.399 --> 03:56:22.127]  Well, so I talk about this in my book, The Road to 9-11, and the last chapter tries to be optimistic, which I am some days, like today, but not always.
[03:56:23.849 --> 03:56:33.115]  And it all hangs on the internet and whether people can use it to mobilize a kind of common front.
[03:56:33.115 --> 03:56:33.995]  I agree with you.
[03:56:33.995 --> 03:56:38.298]  One that overcomes the artificial differences between left and right.
[03:56:38.298 --> 03:56:42.961]  They'll have to learn to give primacy to some different topics.
[03:56:42.961 --> 03:56:43.301]  I agree.
[03:56:43.301 --> 03:56:45.242]  Peter Del Scott, we're out of time.
[03:56:45.242 --> 03:56:49.084]  I want to invite you back in the near future to expand on your intriguing thoughts.
[03:56:49.084 --> 03:56:50.205]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:56:50.205 --> 03:56:50.845]  Thank you.
[03:56:50.845 --> 03:56:51.466]  I enjoyed this.
[03:56:51.866 --> 03:56:52.206]  You bet.
[03:56:52.206 --> 03:56:52.586]  Take care.
[03:56:52.586 --> 03:56:52.966]  There he goes.
[03:56:52.966 --> 03:56:53.947]  PeterDellScott.net.
[03:56:53.947 --> 03:56:58.109]  Now, for the last minute and a half of the show, then it goes into retransmission with all the key info we covered today.
[03:56:58.109 --> 03:57:00.510]  I think a very informative show today.
[03:57:00.510 --> 03:57:05.051]  Ted Anderson, because gold shot up 30-something dollars today, it's only going to go up, folks.
[03:57:05.051 --> 03:57:10.854]  It could go down, but in the overall graph, it's going up with the destruction of the dollar, the New World Order, all of this system.
[03:57:11.554 --> 03:57:14.155]  And Ted has got some amazing gold and silver deals for you today.
[03:57:14.155 --> 03:57:15.275]  I don't have much time.
[03:57:15.275 --> 03:57:16.736]  Ted, tell folks the offers.
[03:57:16.736 --> 03:57:19.777]  You've got gold prices, what, when it was $50, $60 bucks less?
[03:57:19.777 --> 03:57:23.578]  You've still got those offers for folks that want to take advantage of it on silver and gold.
[03:57:23.578 --> 03:57:26.019]  Yeah, you're right about that, Alex, because I have been buying.
[03:57:26.019 --> 03:57:27.840]  I do take advantage of the lower prices.
[03:57:27.840 --> 03:57:29.920]  Right now I do have the Frank at $218.
[03:57:29.920 --> 03:57:33.221]  I've got the British Sovereign at $272.
[03:57:33.221 --> 03:57:36.502]  I also have the Franklin half dollar at $869.
[03:57:38.852 --> 03:57:43.538]  I just gotta say, you know, many other coins that are in smaller volume, I just can't talk about them on air.
[03:57:43.538 --> 03:57:44.860]  We don't have enough time.
[03:57:44.860 --> 03:57:46.302]  But the prices are going up.
[03:57:46.302 --> 03:57:46.863]  Gold went up to $9.44.
[03:57:48.186 --> 03:57:49.786]  The Fed's buying U.S.
[03:57:49.786 --> 03:57:50.306]  Treasuries.
[03:57:50.306 --> 03:57:53.847]  That's driving the stake further into the heart of the United States economy.
[03:57:53.847 --> 03:57:55.348]  So tell folks what you've got and give them the number.
[03:57:55.348 --> 03:57:58.028]  I mean, you bought this gold 50, 60 bucks less than it is now.
[03:57:58.028 --> 03:58:00.049]  You can pass that saving on right now, Ted.
[03:58:00.049 --> 03:58:00.709]  Give them the number.
[03:58:00.709 --> 03:58:00.889]  Yeah, 1-800-686-2237.
[03:58:00.889 --> 03:58:01.129]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[03:58:01.129 --> 03:58:03.069]  I'd suggest people get involved right now.
[03:58:10.252 --> 03:58:14.861]  And you've got, what, Franks and Sovereigns at that price?
[03:58:14.861 --> 03:58:16.785]  Yep, Franks, Sovereigns, all that stuff is discounted right now.
[03:58:16.785 --> 03:58:19.411]  And you're saying you've got some other stuff, folks, you just call and ask about it?
[03:58:20.137 --> 03:58:22.258]  Yep.
[03:58:22.258 --> 03:58:23.939]  And 800... 800-686-2237.
[03:58:23.939 --> 03:58:25.380]  You got some silver too, right, Ted?
[03:58:25.380 --> 03:58:25.820]  Yep.
[03:58:25.820 --> 03:58:28.582]  Silver as well.
[03:58:28.582 --> 03:58:28.902]  800... 800-686-2237.
[03:58:28.902 --> 03:58:32.764]  Folks, protect yourself today in this crazy economy.
[03:58:32.764 --> 03:58:32.864]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:32.864 --> 03:58:34.866]  Thank you, Ted.
[03:58:34.866 --> 03:58:36.707]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:58:36.707 --> 03:58:38.648]  We had a simulcast with Judge Napolitano.
[03:58:38.648 --> 03:58:39.388]  That's coming up.
[03:58:39.388 --> 03:58:41.650]  Stay with us back in one minute at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:41.650 --> 03:58:43.350]  God bless.

[03:58:51.752 --> 03:58:53.413]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.413 --> 03:58:58.175]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.175 --> 03:59:01.136]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.136 --> 03:59:04.177]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.177 --> 03:59:08.879]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:09.119 --> 03:59:10.239]  If you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.239 --> 03:59:13.481]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.481 --> 03:59:20.483]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.483 --> 03:59:23.764]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
