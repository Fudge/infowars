[00:00:00.655 --> 00:00:01.636]  Initiate launch.
[00:00:04.218 --> 00:00:06.140]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:09.503]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:16.650]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.351]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:20.213]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:21.674]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:23.196]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.628]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.178]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.189]  It is February 3rd, 2009.
[00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:44.896]  Massive gun bills to completely ban any guns the Attorney General wishes by extrajudiciary fiat through tyranny.
[00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:48.539]  Bills to psychologically register and control all Americans.
[00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:54.104]  To ban anybody or they put on a no-fly list over a million people innocently being able to own guns, period.
[00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:57.487]  Just absolute tyranny coming down on us.
[00:00:57.527 --> 00:00:58.187]  And one of the bills
[00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:07.733]  This HR 45 interviewed by Congressman Hastings is the one to register everybody and put you through federal psychological testing and training.
[00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:10.215]  Just total control.
[00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:11.696]  They've got bills now.
[00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:14.437]  Defense Department announced a civilian expeditionary force.
[00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:19.500]  So the new thing, separate as big as the military, that's been announced openly.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.741]  They've been saying they would do it.
[00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:21.702]  It's all happening.
[00:01:22.122 --> 00:01:23.583]  But we're about to go to Mike Rivera.
[00:01:23.603 --> 00:01:26.425]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting with a radio show.
[00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:36.712]  But I wanted to go back to Joshua in Florida so that he could give out Mr. Hastings' phone number and also tell us about a 9-11 truth event he's got coming up.
[00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:44.638]  And he's also got a flyer there with him, so if you'd like to go over that flyer later, I'm going to go through the laundry list of bills again, but go ahead.
[00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.679]  Yeah, pretty much.
[00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:53.564]  I have to type up a flyer, but I'm just going to do like a brief synopsis of all this bogus legislation and try to get the word out on campus.
[00:01:53.604 --> 00:01:54.425]  But his number again,
[00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.531]  For the Washington, D.C.
[00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:59.512]  office is 202-225-1313.
[00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:07.794]  And his Fort Lauderdale office is 954-733-2800.
[00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:20.917]  And again, on the 21st of this month at 11 a.m., we're going to have a street action event out here on the busy intersection in front of the University of Central Florida.
[00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:24.558]  A lot of the 9-11 truth groups from around the state are going to be coming here.
[00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:29.377]  You have like a thousand copies of Fabled Enemies, Loose Change, Terror Storm.
[00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:30.338]  You're going to make history.
[00:02:30.658 --> 00:02:35.462]  Let me just ask you, is there a website, is there a contact point for folks to network?
[00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.483]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:42.048]  If you go to, most people are probably familiar with www.meetup.com.
[00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.291]  You can go there and if you just search for Orlando 9-11 Truth,
[00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:47.848]  Pop right up.
[00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.474]  Today, a host of issues, but let's talk about the Second Amendment first.
[00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.176]  This is bold.
[00:03:14.317 --> 00:03:28.089]  The attack they're launching with a lot of sponsorship for bills, I know you've been holding, listening, psychological testing, outright bans, anybody on the no-fly list or the criminal watch list, it's over two million, no-fly list over a million, passed that number last year.
[00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.513]  This is huge, Mike, so your take on that as we go into break.
[00:03:33.527 --> 00:03:43.434]  Well, basically, this morning on WhatReallyHappened.com, we have the video by Rahm Emanuel basically coming out and saying that anybody on the no-fly list should not be allowed to purchase a handgun.
[00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:52.020]  And outside of being an absolute violation of the Second Amendment, the reality is that we know a lot of people on that no-fly list shouldn't be there.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.124]  They're there because they share a name with the terrorists, they've been put on there by mistake, we've heard stories about even Senators
[00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:24.606]  and congressman being blocked from entering airplanes because their name somehow winds up on the list so with the credibility and accuracy of the list so much in doubt how does the government and how does Rahm Emanuel get off basically saying if you're on the list you're not an American and you don't deserve any of the rights anymore which he's on video saying this and it is an absolute outright gun grab and the government is afraid of the American people starting to protest the way we're seeing in Europe right now
[00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:31.254]  But if you go back and you read the founding documents of this country, the Second Amendment was not about hunting or sport shooting.
[00:04:31.494 --> 00:04:36.281]  It was about making sure the American people had the means to resist government gone wrong.
[00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:38.331]  Absolutely.
[00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.793]  We're going to come back to Mike Rivero after this quick break and get more into this.
[00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:44.634]  There's more than 10 bills introduced.
[00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:46.314]  They've got massive sponsorship.
[00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:49.135]  There's hardly any mainstream news reporting on this.
[00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:53.637]  Where the Attorney General, outside of any courts, can just ban any guns he wants.
[00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:56.198]  They say they're going to ban basically all semi-autos.
[00:04:56.498 --> 00:04:57.859]  That's the majority of firearms.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.625]  Uh, and everybody, if you have any type of psychological issue, they make you give over your private records, even juvenile, hand-owned guns.
[00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:07.866]  The no-fly list is a political weapon.
[00:05:08.147 --> 00:05:08.927]  They're going to do this.
[00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:10.068]  No judge, no jury.
[00:05:10.348 --> 00:05:11.369]  This is total tyranny.
[00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:16.793]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.
[00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:23.318]  Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:26.040]  HempUSA.org has a warning that the U.S.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.302]  food supplies are dangerously low and we urge
[00:05:28.302 --> 00:05:28.562]  I think so.
[00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:56.120]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.002]  If the body has the proper nutrition, it will heal itself.
[00:05:59.302 --> 00:06:03.124]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.746]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[00:06:05.926 --> 00:06:10.930]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.914]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:19.936]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:06:21.085 --> 00:06:21.946]  Who is the enemy?
[00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:22.947]  Bin Laden.
[00:06:23.247 --> 00:06:24.208]  This is his M.O.
[00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:25.549]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:06:25.609 --> 00:06:27.271]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:34.357]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:06:34.757 --> 00:06:35.198]  Some U.S.
[00:06:35.238 --> 00:06:40.903]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:45.065]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:47.886]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:12.161]  You worry.
[00:07:12.522 --> 00:07:14.243]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:16.825]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:07:17.246 --> 00:07:19.047]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:20.568]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:24.171]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:29.435]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:33.138]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:35.120]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.062]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:07:38.363 --> 00:07:41.305]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:49.974]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:07:50.455 --> 00:07:54.838]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:58.960]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:03.283]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:08:03.303 --> 00:08:04.664]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.425]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:08:16.164 --> 00:08:20.347]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:21.007 --> 00:08:21.808]  You want answers?
[00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:23.449]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.812]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:32.435]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:41.602]  There's a lot of tough guys that always shoot their mouths off and say, I'm not gonna go get involved in the fight for the Second Amendment.
[00:08:42.858 --> 00:08:48.847]  They're trying to shut down private transfer of firearms, private sales, selling it to your neighbor, getting it to your grandson.
[00:08:49.168 --> 00:08:52.352]  They're raiding, swatting people that buy family firearms.
[00:08:54.238 --> 00:08:57.459]  Or family that store their firearms at somebody else's house.
[00:08:58.619 --> 00:09:02.001]  They're trying to nitpick with rules and regulations that aren't even law.
[00:09:02.961 --> 00:09:10.043]  And they're coming after the Second Amendment with open nationwide gun registration and bans of all semi-autos.
[00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:13.244]  It's all introduced by prominent members of the administration.
[00:09:13.564 --> 00:09:15.245]  Rahm Emanuel, the Chief of Staff,
[00:09:15.865 --> 00:09:25.494]  Eric Holder, the new Attorney General sworn in today, has in briefs before the Supreme Court and in other areas has called for total gun ban.
[00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:31.440]  Barack Obama introduced legislation supporting nationwide Chicago-style gun bans.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.380]  This is it!
[00:09:33.382 --> 00:09:37.123]  And now they want it to wear, and then they've been floating this.
[00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:38.623]  This is from two years ago.
[00:09:38.663 --> 00:09:40.444]  We played the Rahm Emanuel audio earlier.
[00:09:40.464 --> 00:09:45.245]  Later we'll play the video for everybody watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and folks listening on the radio.
[00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:51.087]  He just says, no second right for you if you're on the no-fly list if we think maybe you might be a terrorist.
[00:09:52.096 --> 00:09:54.517]  But under the Patriot Act, it's all misdemeanors.
[00:09:54.637 --> 00:09:57.958]  It's people talking back to a flight attendant.
[00:09:57.998 --> 00:09:58.878]  It's owning marijuana.
[00:09:59.278 --> 00:10:00.299]  No more Second Amendment.
[00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.620]  But people are on the list and can't get off the list.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.082]  Mike Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com, this is just classic
[00:10:09.622 --> 00:10:14.406]  Extrajudiciary tyranny outside the system, and they're doing that on every front.
[00:10:14.807 --> 00:10:23.814]  We're not even the President, but even his designates can just say, ban, ban, ban, or I put you on a list, ban, ban, ban, or we decide if you can own a gun.
[00:10:23.834 --> 00:10:34.743]  I mean, this is really happening, and it ties into Patriot Act compliance, where they're saying no bank account if you haven't paid your taxes, no job if you haven't paid your taxes, or if you don't pay, but we said
[00:10:36.247 --> 00:10:39.418]  But then his entire cabinet, it turns out, don't pay taxes.
[00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.984]  I mean, this is a crew of criminals.
[00:10:42.418 --> 00:10:43.419]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[00:10:43.439 --> 00:10:44.540]  There's a double standard.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.903]  It's the do as we say, don't do as we do mentality, and it's almost a joke.
[00:10:48.943 --> 00:11:11.000]  They're talking about this, you know, the taxes are going to have to go up to cover all of this deficit spending for the stimulus package, which isn't really stimulating much of anything except a few special interests, and yet we're finding out all of the insiders and the upper-level people, they're all using these tax havens, they're avoiding taxes, they're outright refusing to pay, and relying on their political connections to keep them safe from prosecution.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:20.028]  And it really is a very obvious hypocrisy, but the bottom line is the US government recognizes they have pushed the American people to the edge of an outright revolt.
[00:11:20.228 --> 00:11:21.890]  They're seeing it happen all across Europe.
[00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.953]  I had a phone call from a friend of mine in Europe yesterday.
[00:11:24.973 --> 00:11:27.155]  He says, you are not even beginning to hear
[00:11:27.515 --> 00:11:33.258]  The depth of this over there in the United States is far far worse than is being reported in the international media.
[00:11:33.518 --> 00:11:39.501]  Just rioting everywhere in France and Iceland and Ireland now and it's just it's really out of control.
[00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:41.942]  And the US government knows it's going to be coming here.
[00:11:41.982 --> 00:11:43.823]  They're trying to keep people from thinking about it.
[00:11:44.063 --> 00:11:48.045]  That's why we're getting JonBenet Ramsey on the news again today after all this time.
[00:11:48.225 --> 00:11:54.868]  They're desperate to put out something that sounds like news without talking about how bad the economy is and without talking about the fact that
[00:11:55.288 --> 00:11:56.449]  Pretty much around the world.
[00:11:56.529 --> 00:12:00.611]  People are saying enough to this debt-based monetary system of enslavement.
[00:12:00.631 --> 00:12:04.493]  Yeah, that's why we're hearing about Michael Phelps and he smoked some weed.
[00:12:04.513 --> 00:12:09.755]  You know, forget the bankers stealing trillions and not even paying taxes and just open corruption everywhere.
[00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:10.616]  That doesn't matter.
[00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:12.637]  It's Michael Phelps is the news.
[00:12:13.854 --> 00:12:14.555]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:15.876]  It's just trivialization.
[00:12:15.956 --> 00:12:16.916]  It's tabloidism.
[00:12:17.257 --> 00:12:17.817]  And it really is.
[00:12:17.877 --> 00:12:19.718]  It's just one distraction after another.
[00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:22.380]  That's why we can never seem to get rid of Sarah Palin in the news.
[00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:26.083]  It's just anything they can put out there that they hope will distract us.
[00:12:26.424 --> 00:12:29.786]  And I like to call it the contentization of the news, because back in 2001,
[00:12:31.127 --> 00:12:31.668]  When the U.S.
[00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:45.038]  was telling every other country we're getting ready to invade Afghanistan, all we got in this country was Gary Condit and Chandra Levy for week after week after week after week until, boom, 9-11 happens and all of a sudden we're off to war in Afghanistan.
[00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.740]  Big surprise for the Americans, no surprise for anybody else.
[00:12:48.715 --> 00:12:51.960]  You know, that's a key point of 9-11 being an inside job, that 44,000 U.S.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:58.549]  troops, 18,000 British troops, matched in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, in a six-month armored build-up.
[00:12:58.629 --> 00:13:00.852]  It's all over foreign news they're going to invade.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:14.585]  And then the 9-11 magically happens so they can invade, and Bush signs the launch order to attack in one week on September 10th, and his brother gets a bill passed to declare martial law if they wanted to in Florida.
[00:13:15.225 --> 00:13:22.768]  They knew that 9-11 was going to be worse, but for some reason Flight 93 didn't go into the Capitol or its real target.
[00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:25.389]  They were planning federal decapitation of the government.
[00:13:27.137 --> 00:13:42.385]  Uh, well, they were definitely planning on hijacking the government into a war machine, and as far as Flight 93 is concerned, I am convinced that the crew regained control of the airplane, and had it landed safely, the whole story, the whole cover-up would have been blown, and that's why they had to shoot it down.
[00:13:42.685 --> 00:13:49.587]  And we know that from high-level colonels and officers and state police who witnessed the F-16s and the explosion.
[00:13:49.607 --> 00:13:53.648]  That's why it was an 8-mile debris field that sources the state police.
[00:13:53.668 --> 00:13:56.469]  They try to debunk that, but we have the news articles and the videos.
[00:13:57.249 --> 00:14:02.610]  But to make a long story short, yeah, we know they shot two AIM-9s, and that even came out in the NORAD tapes.
[00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.591]  They fired two AIM-9s, which are sidewinder missiles, into it.
[00:14:07.268 --> 00:14:14.454]  And yeah, they had to bring it down because the whole cover-up and deception of this false flag rested on there being no survivors.
[00:14:14.514 --> 00:14:20.058]  It's like when Israel attacked the USS Liberty, they were going to frame Egypt for us and sucker the U.S.
[00:14:20.098 --> 00:14:21.399]  into the war on Israel's side.
[00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:24.902]  But the ship didn't sink and so the whole operation fell apart.
[00:14:25.382 --> 00:14:29.624]  But if you're against them killing our sailors in the most highly decorated ship in U.S.
[00:14:29.664 --> 00:14:40.988]  history and keeping it afloat under three hours of fighter-bomber attack, patrol boat attack, torpedo blowing a 35-foot hole in it, you're then anti-America if you don't support the false flag to kill our troops.
[00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:44.529]  Because to the people running the government, it's patriotic to kill our troops.
[00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:55.929]  If it serves the war cause, I mean, we have documents now how Franklin Roosevelt was saying, I'm willing to sacrifice so many ships and so many men to get us into the war against Hitler.
[00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:58.472]  And this was in the months leading up, of course, to Pearl Harbor.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:17.327]  Absolutely, and if you expand on that, I'm not defending the Imperial Japanese government because they're all corrupt, it's the nature of it, but the Flying Tigers were private contractors for three years before the war started attacking Japanese out of China and then blocking their oil shipments
[00:15:17.947 --> 00:15:18.167]  I don't
[00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:38.351]  In the two hours before, they were sinking them and getting emergency broadcast.
[00:15:39.032 --> 00:15:41.753]  One even sort of coming into the harbor was only a mile outside.
[00:15:41.793 --> 00:15:43.134]  They sunk it out by a reef.
[00:15:43.534 --> 00:15:44.955]  And this is now even on CNN.
[00:15:45.275 --> 00:15:51.998]  And they even have one of the submarines that they sunk out at the Fredericksburg Pacific War Museum in Fredericksburg, Texas.
[00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:57.761]  One of the subs, the midget subs, they sunk that day and still ordered the stand down.
[00:15:57.982 --> 00:16:00.043]  Imagine, subs are attacking!
[00:16:00.743 --> 00:16:07.580]  And they've got ships out destroying them, and then they're ordering a stand down as people at the base at Pearl Harbor are saying, we're under attack.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.026]  No, no, stand down, stand down, stand down.
[00:16:11.363 --> 00:16:15.704]  Yeah, all war is based on deception, as Sun Tzu says.
[00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:24.547]  It's interesting to note how many people wrote in their diaries that 9-11 was the 21st century version of Pearl Harbor.
[00:16:24.687 --> 00:16:27.568]  Everybody was making that connection and that illusion.
[00:16:27.608 --> 00:16:30.909]  The bottom line is that Pearl Harbor, there was a lot of deception about that.
[00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.370]  We now know that
[00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.531]  I think?
[00:16:48.667 --> 00:16:54.433]  And right now, today, we're seeing this hideous push for a new war in Iran, because every time the U.S.
[00:16:54.453 --> 00:16:58.197]  gets into an economic mess, they get out of it by getting into a world war.
[00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:00.920]  And I think that's what's on everybody's mind right now.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:09.449]  If they can kick up a new world war, starting in the Mideast, that everybody's economic problems will go away, or at least nobody will talk about them, because it's unpatriotic.
[00:17:09.989 --> 00:17:13.452]  Well, that's what the RAND Corporation said three months ago and it made big European news.
[00:17:13.512 --> 00:17:15.173]  It's confirmed, but it was never on the news here.
[00:17:15.213 --> 00:17:19.636]  They said, this is the top think tank advising the Trilateral Commission and CFR, for those that don't know.
[00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:26.822]  They said, we've got to have something on a World War level, but not to get us out of trouble, to get the people to stand down in false patriotism.
[00:17:27.162 --> 00:17:32.546]  While the foreign banks take over, while we are losing our homes, and that's what Obama's saying.
[00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:33.627]  It's going to get tough.
[00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:34.567]  Austerity.
[00:17:35.108 --> 00:17:35.808]  Stick together.
[00:17:35.868 --> 00:17:42.273]  Stick together means us losing our jobs, losing our pensions, while the bankers set up world government on the corpse of the United States.
[00:17:43.754 --> 00:17:55.462]  And it really is silly because globalism got us into this mess, and saying that globalism can get us out, that's like saying that if we whack the front of the Titanic against the other side of the iceberg, that maybe we can save the ship.
[00:17:56.598 --> 00:18:07.846]  Now that's what I've thought is really, this weekend I watched hours on C-SPAN, stuck in a hotel room, I watched hours of C-SPAN, of Davos, and they would just repeat the same thing like parrots.
[00:18:07.866 --> 00:18:19.793]  They'd have these panels with Prime Ministers and Presidents and leaders, and it was all globalism, New World Order, only globalism will fix this problem, this is worldwide crises, this is a worldwide economic takedown by design.
[00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:26.578]  They got this global grid in place, as they said they would, in their own documents, to implode things, and then now they're posing as the saviors.
[00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:43.128]  Well, every time I hear the word globalism, I keep reminding myself that globalism is what Alexander the Great wanted, it's what Hitler wanted, it's what Napoleon wanted, and it's never worked out well for the ordinary people when somebody starts thinking, I should run the whole planet.
[00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:44.909]  Well, you're right.
[00:18:44.929 --> 00:18:48.411]  I know you have a lot of optimism, but
[00:18:49.605 --> 00:18:53.590]  These guys are so bold, it looks like they've gone to the point of no return regardless.
[00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.614]  It looks like they're going to go ahead and press for total tyranny.
[00:18:57.918 --> 00:18:59.359]  Well, they're certainly pushing for it.
[00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:01.340]  As you say, they've gone too far.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.841]  They can't turn around and turn back.
[00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:05.523]  Whether they can achieve it or not, I don't know.
[00:19:05.543 --> 00:19:09.306]  I am very buoyed by the events of Europe where we're seeing all these riots.
[00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.487]  The government of Iceland has had to step down.
[00:19:12.108 --> 00:19:15.710]  I am amazed that we are not seeing those kind of riots here in the U.S.
[00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:21.514]  yet, although with California now being broke and cutting off the welfare payments, I think that may certainly start.
[00:19:22.215 --> 00:19:25.857]  We used to joke all the time about the government putting tranquilizers in the drinking water.
[00:19:25.877 --> 00:19:26.738]  I'm kind of wondering if
[00:19:28.142 --> 00:19:37.506]  You know, given the amounts of pharmaceuticals that are known to be in the tap water, if there isn't some element of truth there, because I don't understand why the American people are not showing more anger at this point.
[00:19:37.986 --> 00:19:42.508]  Well, you know, they've done studies where there's water supplies that aren't connected to sewage.
[00:19:43.408 --> 00:19:49.229]  And they still have levels way off the charts of Prozac molecules.
[00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:50.989]  Serotonin reuptake inhibitor class.
[00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:57.211]  And did you know that on the news they proposed putting Prozac in the water and statins for her heart?
[00:19:57.731 --> 00:20:00.051]  So, Mike, it's already going on.
[00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:07.453]  Every major water supply in the country has levels of Prozac-type drugs many times higher than could be there from runoff.
[00:20:07.753 --> 00:20:09.333]  So they are putting drugs in the water.
[00:20:12.853 --> 00:20:15.874]  Stop wasting your time struggling with everything you're trying to learn.
[00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.075]  Learning should be a pleasure not torture.
[00:20:18.456 --> 00:20:24.758]  The School of Phenomenal Memory gives you the training and tools you need to memorize any type of information quickly and efficiently.

[00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:15.437]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:21.286]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:22.828]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:22.868 --> 00:21:26.854]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:27.555 --> 00:21:40.864]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:41.365 --> 00:21:46.668]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.

[00:22:24.423 --> 00:22:31.185]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:22:31.525 --> 00:22:35.106]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:22:35.486 --> 00:22:38.647]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:22:38.887 --> 00:22:40.608]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:22:40.648 --> 00:22:46.390]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:22:56.113 --> 00:22:56.493]  We're good.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.141]  The headlines are clear.
[00:23:13.221 --> 00:23:15.662]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[00:23:16.122 --> 00:23:18.703]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[00:23:19.343 --> 00:23:20.983]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:24.244]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[00:23:24.385 --> 00:23:26.985]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.

[00:23:46.756 --> 00:23:47.597]  Big John Lipscomb.
[00:23:47.637 --> 00:23:57.343]  The host of Don't Tread on Me is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him, restaurants and small delis.
[00:23:57.383 --> 00:23:58.644]  Don't buy from copycats.

[00:24:19.437 --> 00:24:22.058]  until 3 p.m.
[00:24:22.118 --> 00:24:26.180]  We are here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.061]  I want to open the phones up coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:29.081 --> 00:24:31.402]  Mike Rivero riding shotgun a little bit into the next hour with us.
[00:24:37.591 --> 00:24:40.714]  There's a lot of other important news I want to go over with him.
[00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:43.156]  The bottom line for everybody out there to realize is this.
[00:24:44.037 --> 00:24:54.788]  The nature of what we're facing with the criminal globalists is so real and so over the top that I want to stress to you that it is far worse than we can even explain to you.
[00:24:55.268 --> 00:24:58.830]  They are engaging in economic warfare against all of us.
[00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.770]  They have passed the point of no return.
[00:25:01.151 --> 00:25:06.473]  They are believing their momentum and just the over-the-top savageness of what they're doing is going to carry them through.
[00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:12.376]  They are racing to bring in military, illegal aliens, criminals, felons into the military.
[00:25:12.716 --> 00:25:17.438]  They are racing to bring in private mercenaries and domestic armies, and I want to go over that.
[00:25:18.218 --> 00:25:22.680]  Because, as you know, Mike Rivero, we wrote a story about it at Infowars.net last Friday.
[00:25:22.981 --> 00:25:25.782]  Defense Department announced a civilian expeditionary force.
[00:25:26.202 --> 00:25:31.025]  They're going to be joint trained for domestic operations and foreign operations, but will not be combat.
[00:25:31.505 --> 00:25:33.006]  And then they're going to integrate this in.
[00:25:33.026 --> 00:25:43.511]  This is the Defense Department 1404.10, and it integrates into the FEMA camp bill they've introduced, saying the clergy will be there, telling the public it's safe to go in, to turn their guns in.
[00:25:43.531 --> 00:25:46.653]  I mean, they're really making their move with a huge
[00:25:47.474 --> 00:25:52.936]  mechanism to to to carry this out but I mean if I don't see it working Mike
[00:25:54.304 --> 00:25:55.565]  Well, I have to agree with you.
[00:25:55.605 --> 00:26:14.898]  I know they're making the plans and they're moving forward with it, but some of these people seem very, very detached from reality, and I get the sense that because so many old Cold War fossils are in charge of these operations, they just don't get how the world has changed around them because of the blogs and the Internet, websites like yours and mine, alternative radio like this.
[00:26:15.218 --> 00:26:21.222]  They really, I think, have an over-exaggerated sense of their own success, and I think, ultimately, it's doomed to failure.
[00:26:21.662 --> 00:26:26.584]  Sadly, I think a lot of people are going to get hurt in the process, and it'll always be the wrong people.
[00:26:26.624 --> 00:26:27.584]  The innocent will die.
[00:26:29.485 --> 00:26:40.869]  But really, I do think they can't pull it off, because we have seen this time and time again, and I go back to the words of Gandhi, who said, sometimes tyrants can seem to be
[00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:59.970]  In this case, I think the fact that they had to delay because of the Iran-Contra scandal and because the first attempt to bomb the World Trade Towers did not produce the desired result.
[00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:05.276]  I think they delayed longer than they really felt they could handle because of the deteriorating economy.
[00:27:05.737 --> 00:27:11.864]  And as I said before, right now everyone perceives globalism as the reason the entire world is in this economic mess.
[00:27:12.265 --> 00:27:15.309]  It's going to be a tough sell saying that globalism will get us out.
[00:27:15.729 --> 00:27:16.670]  As far as...
[00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.751]  I don't think so at this point.
[00:27:47.792 --> 00:27:50.314]  I think this has to be the shortest political honeymoon on record.
[00:27:50.615 --> 00:27:58.744]  He's only into the second week of the job and already pretty much everybody, even his most ardent supporters, are saying there is no change that we can believe in.
[00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:00.026]  It's the same old stuff.
[00:28:00.827 --> 00:28:05.292]  I'm already calling him the token president, not because of his skin color, but because everything he does
[00:28:05.992 --> 00:28:08.574]  In line with his campaign promises, it's a token amount.
[00:28:08.834 --> 00:28:10.235]  He was going to cut defense spending.
[00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:11.235]  It was a token amount.
[00:28:11.475 --> 00:28:12.556]  He was going to end torture.
[00:28:12.796 --> 00:28:18.099]  He did the token measure of closing Guantanamo, but those prisoners are still other places and still being abused.
[00:28:18.419 --> 00:28:20.861]  He was going to end the war, but it's a token troop cut.
[00:28:21.101 --> 00:28:24.703]  Now they're talking about even abandoning the 16-month promise to get our kids home.
[00:28:25.163 --> 00:28:26.484]  So there is no change.
[00:28:26.544 --> 00:28:27.544]  It's just more of the same.
[00:28:27.845 --> 00:28:29.986]  And yes, Barack Obama is just the front man.
[00:28:30.366 --> 00:28:31.587]  It's the same old faces.
[00:28:31.607 --> 00:28:33.648]  He's got the Clinton cabinet, Clinton light.
[00:28:34.008 --> 00:28:35.210]  If you want to call him behind him.
[00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:42.499]  And certainly having Rahm Emanuel there as Chief of Staff in the White House is a very, very dangerous sign regarding Israel's control over our government.
[00:28:43.869 --> 00:28:56.838]  It was in the New York Times that Rahm Emanuel, he was cracking his knuckles in a congressional meeting with congressional leadership with Obama there, and he said, please, Rahm, that's distracting, don't do that, because he's got this decorum.
[00:28:57.938 --> 00:29:00.020]  He is a gentleman, has a lot of dignity that he projects.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:08.185]  And Rahm got up in Barack's ear, in front of the leaders of Congress, and popped his knuckles in his ear and said, I'll do whatever I want.
[00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:13.289]  And then they put that in the New York Times and giggle about it with the headline, the second most powerful man in America.
[00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.626]  I mean, he did that to let Congress know I run things.
[00:29:17.952 --> 00:29:20.353]  Yeah, that was definitely a very defiant thing.
[00:29:20.433 --> 00:29:25.334]  If I had been Barack Obama in that situation, Rahm would have been fired right there on the spot.
[00:29:25.674 --> 00:29:36.896]  And if Barack Obama does not move to establish or assert his control over the White House process, then he's basically, he's already crippled for the rest of his administration.
[00:29:37.216 --> 00:29:43.578]  For any business owner, imagine you got ten employees around you at a conference table, one of them's popping their knuckles, you say, please stop that, and they get up in your ear.
[00:29:44.258 --> 00:29:46.160]  And pop it here, you'd be like, you're fired!
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.303]  And any other president, the whole staff kisses up to him.
[00:29:49.623 --> 00:29:50.243]  Not happening.
[00:29:50.283 --> 00:29:53.967]  It's in the news that ROM bosses Barack Obama around in front of everybody.
[00:29:54.247 --> 00:29:55.008]  He's doing that.
[00:29:55.088 --> 00:29:57.150]  Everybody know, he is the president.
[00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.352]  And he's not even an American, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:59.372 --> 00:30:00.393]  He's an IDF soldier.
[00:30:00.613 --> 00:30:01.874]  His father, one of the founders of Mossad.
[00:30:01.914 --> 00:30:02.775]  We're on the march.
[00:30:03.255 --> 00:30:04.856]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:05.797 --> 00:30:08.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.881]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:30:14.001 --> 00:30:19.183]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:30:19.363 --> 00:30:20.704]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:30:20.964 --> 00:30:29.147]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:30:29.367 --> 00:30:35.090]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.051]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:30:37.111 --> 00:30:39.271]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:30:39.291 --> 00:30:43.653]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:30:43.833 --> 00:30:45.933]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:30:46.033 --> 00:30:53.816]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:31:11.851 --> 00:31:18.136]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:31:18.496 --> 00:31:20.178]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:31:21.109 --> 00:31:22.150]  But who is the enemy?
[00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:23.171]  Bin Laden.
[00:31:23.451 --> 00:31:24.432]  This is his ammo.
[00:31:24.452 --> 00:31:25.753]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:27.495]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:31:27.815 --> 00:31:34.581]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:31:34.981 --> 00:31:35.402]  Some U.S.
[00:31:35.462 --> 00:31:41.107]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:31:41.787 --> 00:31:45.310]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.092]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.591]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:15.051 --> 00:32:18.331]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:24.753]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:32:25.133 --> 00:32:29.274]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:32:29.754 --> 00:32:35.475]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:32:35.775 --> 00:32:38.835]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:32:39.196 --> 00:32:41.096]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios,
[00:32:41.476 --> 00:32:41.896]  I think so.
[00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:44.834]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sun shine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Bolton Prison And time keeps draggin' on But that train keeps a-rollin' On down to San Antone On down to San Antone Alright, let's go back to Mike Rivero My mama told me son
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:53.933]  Mike, I want to go to some calls here in a few minutes, but I want to run through and get your great political expertise take on it.
[00:33:57.202 --> 00:34:06.109]  We see this pattern when they propose a national compulsory service, 18 to 24, and they also say when you're in high school you'll have to serve compulsory government federal service.
[00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.232]  Openly federal curriculum under the brand name Barack Obama.
[00:34:11.433 --> 00:34:13.315]  So now the covert federalization is opening up.
[00:34:13.335 --> 00:34:19.379]  They've introduced legislation that's rapidly moving through Congress to federalize college security under Homeland Security.
[00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:22.102]  So they're grabbing more and more enclaves of federal control.
[00:34:23.022 --> 00:34:26.924]  They're announcing they're going to grab more highways and make them international zones for taxation.
[00:34:27.804 --> 00:34:29.965]  They're now announcing they're going to continue the North American Union.
[00:34:30.885 --> 00:34:35.167]  But when they come out with National Compulsory Service, they always give it a nice front or package.
[00:34:35.527 --> 00:34:38.108]  They say, oh, well, it's National Compulsory Soup Kitchens.
[00:34:38.128 --> 00:34:38.708]  You've got to help.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:44.210]  But then it's also Tattletail Squads and military and environmental squads and the rest of it.
[00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:50.172]  Other areas you've noticed about how they're packaging things, the way they're using modern marketing.
[00:34:50.192 --> 00:34:53.473]  Because I am seeing the dinosaurs realize they're behind the curve.
[00:34:53.753 --> 00:35:00.015]  And I see a newer management team, more dangerous, coming in under Obama.
[00:35:00.055 --> 00:35:05.196]  So I think that edge we had, where they were still in delusional la-la land, I think we're starting to lose that.
[00:35:05.256 --> 00:35:07.497]  Now, we had all that time to build up our forces.
[00:35:08.878 --> 00:35:15.643]  And the globalists are starting to get in some trouble in my opinion, but don't you see them modernizing their propaganda?
[00:35:16.703 --> 00:35:32.655]  Yeah, I see them getting into some new marketing strategies, but the reality is, and you can know this from advertising history, once your audience or once your customers are skeptical of the product, changing advertising is seldom going to work.
[00:35:34.576 --> 00:35:36.337]  New Coke vs. Classic Coke.
[00:35:36.677 --> 00:35:37.558]  Look at the Edsel.
[00:35:38.278 --> 00:35:44.921]  I mean, history is full of all of these disasters of good products that got a bad rep, and then no advertising could save them.
[00:35:45.221 --> 00:35:48.503]  Now, I know ad execs don't like to admit that, but that really is the truth.
[00:35:48.863 --> 00:35:51.865]  The bottom line here is that government operates like a religion.
[00:35:51.985 --> 00:35:55.586]  It relies on the faith of the masses in order to function.
[00:35:55.947 --> 00:35:57.627]  And we've already had our crisis of faith.
[00:35:57.867 --> 00:35:58.988]  We don't trust the government.
[00:35:59.048 --> 00:36:00.949]  We know the government lied to us about Saddam's
[00:36:01.329 --> 00:36:02.210]  Nuclear bombs.
[00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:09.073]  So all the new packaging and glitz and glamour and confetti, I don't think it's going to really sway a lot of people.
[00:36:09.773 --> 00:36:10.533]  We know.
[00:36:10.613 --> 00:36:12.174]  We've got a government that is lying to us.
[00:36:12.194 --> 00:36:14.435]  We know a government that is acting unconstitutionally.
[00:36:14.775 --> 00:36:20.858]  This whole civilian workforce thing is a violation of the 13th Amendment against involuntary servitude.
[00:36:21.378 --> 00:36:26.821]  So the American people are going to... just wrapping it in a new shiny package isn't going to change it.
[00:36:26.841 --> 00:36:28.722]  It's still the same old manure inside.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.581]  I agree with you.
[00:36:31.941 --> 00:36:47.675]  On another issue, I saw this this morning and didn't have time to go pull up the sources, but if people want to check them out, and I know you're really up to speed on this, I can't remember the exact name of the military plans from 1983, re-proposed in 1994, then I saw it in 1990, Gulf War planning by the Pentagon,
[00:36:54.381 --> 00:36:57.843]  Adopted from Israel, but Israel first proposed it in 83 and 84.
[00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.224]  One of their top generals proposed it.
[00:37:00.244 --> 00:37:01.505]  It was in their white papers.
[00:37:02.065 --> 00:37:17.353]  I did find, doing some research this morning, a bunch of top Israeli rabbis saying, and on their own websites, groups in Israel, the Greater Israel, where it runs from where Israel is today, basically as a triangle, all the way over to the Strait of Hormuzh.
[00:37:18.073 --> 00:37:24.536]  Taking over that key waterway and grabbing about 80% of what is Iraq today, about 40% of Saudi Arabia.
[00:37:24.556 --> 00:37:26.997]  In fact, I should have brought that up.
[00:37:27.037 --> 00:37:28.738]  Guys, Google Greater Israel.
[00:37:29.318 --> 00:37:30.518]  Just put up the photos.
[00:37:30.538 --> 00:37:32.979]  Oh, you can't because we've got a mic up on that computer.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.240]  Well, find it and print it up.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.181]  So we can't pull up images right now.
[00:37:37.247 --> 00:37:37.567]  Period.
[00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:38.768]  Oh, we can on that computer.
[00:37:38.808 --> 00:37:39.208]  Okay, good.
[00:37:39.528 --> 00:37:41.269]  Find it, and then I'll show you which one.
[00:37:41.689 --> 00:37:43.730]  Because, I mean, this is an official with Hebrew on it.
[00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:44.951]  This is really going on.
[00:37:45.411 --> 00:37:46.672]  A larger Israel.
[00:37:47.272 --> 00:37:50.974]  And in that same plan, several plans, that are adopted by the Pentagon.
[00:37:50.994 --> 00:37:51.734]  You can just Google this.
[00:37:51.754 --> 00:37:52.334]  I shouldn't have time.
[00:37:52.354 --> 00:37:53.195]  I had to run out this morning.
[00:37:54.516 --> 00:37:57.478]  Because I've done the research previously, but I wanted to have it here.
[00:37:58.158 --> 00:38:09.067]  Because I noticed that Wayne Madsen wrote an article about how Israel is saying they want to start creating settlements through Kurds who are Jewish.
[00:38:09.467 --> 00:38:11.028]  In fact, I did print it this morning.
[00:38:11.509 --> 00:38:12.830]  Here is the Hebrew map of it.
[00:38:13.803 --> 00:38:28.999]  You guys can give me a close-up over there, I'll show folks, of greater Israel and the plan is to break Iraq in three parts, break Syria in four parts, break Iran in five to seven parts, and I've even heard this on NPR, so it is out there.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.602]  So, here you have what is originally Israel.
[00:38:34.102 --> 00:38:43.266]  They want to grab part of Egypt, grab part of Saudi Arabia, grab a bunch of Iraq, all the way over here to the Strait of Hormuz, and then even grab some of the waterway there.
[00:38:43.346 --> 00:38:46.127]  And this is being proposed by the Israeli military.
[00:38:46.147 --> 00:38:48.568]  Anybody who wants to research it can see it there.
[00:38:48.768 --> 00:38:51.289]  And the Iraq invasion wasn't just about oil, weapons sales.
[00:38:52.569 --> 00:38:57.491]  But about population control, they're trying to bring in eugenics now in Iraq, where you can't have more than two children.
[00:38:57.671 --> 00:38:59.231]  They're proposing that now in our media.
[00:38:59.291 --> 00:39:08.674]  I was watching a lot of TV this weekend, saw them attacking a woman who had eight babies, even though the doctor admitted that they usually implant eight and only two or three take hold.
[00:39:08.954 --> 00:39:11.634]  They were saying how evil she is, should the children be taken away.
[00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:18.536]  Having more than two children is evil, it hurts the earth, it hurts our economy, and really it's the future of our economy with all these baby boomers who are retiring.
[00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:20.897]  But they want to replace that with third world populations.
[00:39:21.617 --> 00:39:22.217]  Being brought in.
[00:39:22.997 --> 00:39:25.718]  So that's a big setup there, Mike.
[00:39:25.778 --> 00:39:36.040]  But the point is, greater Israel, about 30-40 times bigger than it is now, this really is been proposed by Israel.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.720]  And so I wanted to pick your brain.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.841]  Do you remember the name of the Israeli reports in 83 and 84?
[00:39:41.461 --> 00:39:43.722]  And then the adoption of that by the US in 90?
[00:39:44.362 --> 00:39:45.562]  And then your comments on it.
[00:39:46.733 --> 00:39:50.496]  Okay, I actually don't recall the exact name of it, but you're absolutely correct.
[00:39:50.616 --> 00:40:02.365]  Israel's plan all along has been for a much wider area of that part of the world to be considered Israel, and the two stripes on the flag of Israel represent the Nile and Euphrates Rivers.
[00:40:02.853 --> 00:40:12.077]  Which, according to their religious beliefs, comprise the land that God gave to the twelve tribes that followed Moses out of Egypt.
[00:40:12.957 --> 00:40:20.741]  And so they see everything that they do in terms of grabbing more land as justified because, in their minds, they already own it anyway.
[00:40:20.861 --> 00:40:30.565]  And there was a very interesting article that came out over the weekend that said one of the reasons there is so much support for Operation Cast Lead in Israel is because the Israeli government and media
[00:40:30.845 --> 00:40:31.185]  I think?
[00:40:50.633 --> 00:41:03.424]  And my advice to the people of Iraq is take a look at what happened when they started building settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, and that is your future unless you put your foot down now and say, you know, absolutely not.
[00:41:03.924 --> 00:41:10.930]  Because it's just going to keep on spreading and there's going to be more war and more death, and we the American people are going to be forced to pay for it all.
[00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:16.955]  Yeah, for those that don't know, here's a crude map of Israel, and in 19...
[00:41:19.026 --> 00:41:26.912]  In 1947, there were some tiny settlements that the Israelis had moved into.
[00:41:26.972 --> 00:41:27.973]  It basically looked like that.
[00:41:28.874 --> 00:41:32.036]  Those little circles are where you had the Israeli enclaves.
[00:41:32.396 --> 00:41:38.441]  This is on record, led by the Chief of Staff of the White House's father as one of the commanders.
[00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:42.464]  They launched attacks into all the Arab settlements around them.
[00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:46.350]  Pushing most of them out of the country.
[00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:52.293]  Bombing, going in and shooting up the different bazaars, the different grocery stores, the different markets.
[00:41:53.934 --> 00:42:05.879]  And then, if you look at the map today, because of the pushing the people out, you know, by the 1950s it was this, and by the 1960s it was this.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.783]  And now today, you know, all you have is a few little tiny spots
[00:42:15.543 --> 00:42:16.964]  Yeah, there's a map of greater Israel.
[00:42:18.606 --> 00:42:20.347]  That's one of the even bigger ones.
[00:42:20.688 --> 00:42:23.050]  But the government of Israel, other groups have put out these.
[00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:29.636]  To where the Arabs are in just a few tiny, tiny little pockets.
[00:42:30.676 --> 00:42:31.878]  So the settlements are sent out as
[00:42:32.578 --> 00:42:34.058]  As like probe droids.
[00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:36.339]  And then they expand out from there.
[00:42:36.379 --> 00:42:37.159]  Mike, you want to explain this?
[00:42:37.379 --> 00:42:41.320]  Because Israel, it's in the Israeli papers, and Madsen just wrote an article about it and didn't source a lot.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.121]  I'm going to have him on.
[00:42:42.801 --> 00:42:46.962]  And people are like, oh, I don't believe this, but I've just over and over again seen this in Israeli newspapers.
[00:42:47.322 --> 00:42:51.163]  I mean, I've read and I did pull up some of their religious leaders saying it this morning.
[00:42:51.183 --> 00:42:58.625]  Maybe you should do one of your great What Really Happened data pages with just all the mainline proof of this, because a lot of people are in denial
[00:42:59.165 --> 00:43:03.652]  about this, and can you imagine the wars we've already seen?
[00:43:04.674 --> 00:43:09.922]  That if Israel tries to expand out and take over Iraq and large parts of Saudi Arabia, what's going to happen?
[00:43:11.124 --> 00:43:14.328]  Well, you know, it's easy to see, and I do have a data page like that.
[00:43:14.348 --> 00:43:16.670]  I'll put it up on my website as soon as I'm off the air with you.
[00:43:17.071 --> 00:43:22.177]  But what's going on, of course, is that Israel gets other people to do the conquering for them.
[00:43:22.557 --> 00:43:30.246]  I mean, they're moving into Iraq now, but it was American men and American women and American tax dollars that paid to smash Iraq.
[00:43:30.606 --> 00:43:32.407]  So that Israel can start moving into it.
[00:43:32.768 --> 00:43:34.849]  And now they're getting ready to repeat the same thing in Iran.
[00:43:35.049 --> 00:43:39.312]  And they're using the same lines about nuclear weapons and oh what a danger Iran is.
[00:43:39.632 --> 00:43:41.314]  And everybody's going to attack Iran.
[00:43:41.354 --> 00:43:44.976]  And once Iran is shattered and smashed, you're going to see the same thing.
[00:43:45.136 --> 00:43:50.340]  Israel will start setting up settlements inside Iran with the goal of taking it all over.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.462]  And it is conquest.
[00:43:52.802 --> 00:43:56.104]  And it goes all the way back to the Torah, the Old Testament.
[00:43:56.544 --> 00:43:59.747]  God wants us to go out and smite the wicked and take over their lands.
[00:44:00.367 --> 00:44:10.074]  And it's being done here in the 21st century with modern warfare, and Israel gets American kids to die for Israel's war, and that has got to stop.
[00:44:10.394 --> 00:44:18.000]  And isn't this also just classic colonialism, where a group comes in and then just starts setting up settlements and expanding?
[00:44:19.794 --> 00:44:30.726]  It's classic colonialism, and more than that, Israel has done to Palestine what Hitler tried to do to Poland and France, and the whole world got together and told Hitler, you can't do that.
[00:44:31.166 --> 00:44:35.952]  And yet, for some reason, when Israel does it to Palestine, nobody dares say anything.
[00:44:37.714 --> 00:44:41.637]  Well, I mean, plus, I mean, this isn't good for Jews.
[00:44:42.197 --> 00:44:44.318]  I mean, to have all the Arabs in the world hating them.
[00:44:44.799 --> 00:44:46.980]  I mean, look at the conflict we've already seen in Israel.
[00:44:47.481 --> 00:44:50.603]  And the United States and Israel just get more and more hated.
[00:44:50.923 --> 00:44:51.883]  And we're bankrupt.
[00:44:52.224 --> 00:44:53.545]  And everything's falling apart.
[00:44:54.465 --> 00:44:57.827]  And all the establishment seems to want to do is launch even bigger wars.
[00:44:58.788 --> 00:45:02.531]  And what shocks me is Israel's on record saying they want to expand out.
[00:45:03.696 --> 00:45:06.879]  And then if you talk about it, people deny it's even going on.
[00:45:06.939 --> 00:45:09.121]  So, I've done all this research in the past.
[00:45:09.141 --> 00:45:10.603]  I'm going to pull a bunch of this together this week.
[00:45:10.623 --> 00:45:11.484]  I know you are as well.
[00:45:11.884 --> 00:45:13.686]  And I'm going to come in here and do a presentation on this.
[00:45:14.526 --> 00:45:18.370]  Because, I mean, if you think we've got wars now, folks, imagine.
[00:45:19.131 --> 00:45:20.432]  Imagine a map like this.
[00:45:20.452 --> 00:45:23.014]  I mean, it's just hard for me to...
[00:45:23.988 --> 00:45:27.012]  Hard for me to deal with, and hard for me to even get my mind around this.
[00:45:27.033 --> 00:45:29.336]  I want to go to calls in a moment, Mike.
[00:45:29.596 --> 00:45:31.219]  Can you stay with us about 20 minutes to the next hour?
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:32.440]  Certainly.
[00:45:32.801 --> 00:45:34.664]  Okay, because we can start taking calls in about five minutes.
[00:45:34.684 --> 00:45:35.986]  There's plenty of time for those.
[00:45:36.787 --> 00:45:37.187]  Obama.
[00:45:38.379 --> 00:45:41.620]  He spearheads with Rahm Emanuel, who they bragged as the architect of the bailout.
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.180]  That's in Nancy Pelosi's own words.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:44.981]  Rahm the architect.
[00:45:46.081 --> 00:45:47.521]  Of course, he's a front man for the big banks.
[00:45:48.041 --> 00:45:48.901]  They're coming in.
[00:45:49.002 --> 00:45:53.643]  They've already got an unlimited blank check to steal any amount of money they want.
[00:45:53.943 --> 00:45:55.923]  Congress isn't even allowed to look into it.
[00:45:56.223 --> 00:45:59.044]  There's now been congressional hearings with the Federal Reserve, since we won't tell you where the money went.
[00:45:59.864 --> 00:46:06.966]  Now the new bailout will create this new international bank with no oversight with the power and regulatory power over U.S.
[00:46:07.006 --> 00:46:10.627]  banks so they can come in and snatch up the real banks and insurance companies.
[00:46:12.087 --> 00:46:22.650]  And then last week Obama was on TV, I was watching this in my hotel room Friday night, angry going, how dare the people in the bailout steal this money for bonuses, I want an investigation, but he named no names.
[00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:24.631]  I mean this is like the fox caught with
[00:46:25.151 --> 00:46:34.754]  With the feathers of the pigeons or the feathers of the chickens sticking out of its mouth and it's going, I'm going to do something about this with chicken blood all over its chest.
[00:46:35.174 --> 00:46:42.796]  You know, it's got a bib on and a knife and fork and there's dead chickens laying around or it's got a chicken in its mouth and it goes, I'm going to do something about that darn fox.
[00:46:42.996 --> 00:46:44.936]  I mean, do they think the public is that dumb?
[00:46:45.156 --> 00:46:47.957]  So your analysis of this new banker takeover.
[00:46:49.212 --> 00:46:52.014]  Well, yes, unfortunately they do think the public is that dumb.
[00:46:52.495 --> 00:46:56.658]  As far as this new bank, this new global bank, it's just another reserve system.
[00:46:56.698 --> 00:46:58.520]  It's another debt-based institution.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.282]  It's like the Federal Reserve on steroids.
[00:47:01.642 --> 00:47:04.224]  And again, this is what got us into this mess.
[00:47:04.665 --> 00:47:15.574]  And we need to get away from this imaginary money economy and get back to a monetary system like we had when the country was set up, which was a fixed unit of value represented by every single dollar.
[00:47:15.994 --> 00:47:19.678]  Douglas Goldstein, financial planner & investment advisor, interviewed Jones on Arutz Sheva Radio.
[00:47:19.758 --> 00:47:23.682]  Douglas Goldstein, financial planner & investment advisor, interviewed Jones on Arutz Sheva Radio.
[00:47:38.738 --> 00:47:39.918]  It's a good question.
[00:47:59.884 --> 00:48:00.925]  I just want to add, from 1800 until 1913.
[00:48:19.833 --> 00:48:30.841]  This country had money that was worth the same amount, and in some cases, it even lost, actually gained some of its value, or lost inflation.
[00:48:31.381 --> 00:48:45.331]  So, I mean, the inflation tax, conservatively, at about 15% a year right now, is such an incredible form of theft, and such a blight over the convention of savings.
[00:48:46.499 --> 00:48:54.201]  I just want to add that, and this is on record, volumes have been written in congressional testimony on this, the private bankers that wanted to bankrupt the U.S.
[00:48:54.221 --> 00:49:01.883]  so they could hijack it and set up a central bank, they tried to bankrupt the United States from the 1890s right into 1913.
[00:49:01.943 --> 00:49:09.365]  They had all these runs on banks, they staged all these gold and silver runs, and then they advertised for decades, and their battle plans are even public how they did it.
[00:49:09.645 --> 00:49:14.986]  Bought up the newspapers so they could then propagandize and said we'll never have another recession or depression again.
[00:49:15.766 --> 00:49:22.354]  And before those were just localized only in certain industries or certain areas, they weren't nationwide, so it wasn't a big deal to the average person.
[00:49:22.815 --> 00:49:25.858]  They said, let us have central control, you'll never have another depression again.
[00:49:26.279 --> 00:49:31.866]  Then they accelerated the money supply in 1913, they bought real assets with it, and then popped the
[00:49:33.107 --> 00:49:45.721]  bubble they engineered this is on record by design in twenty nine and so they do the same thing then they give us an income tax then they give us the federal control they expand their power and now they're making a move much bigger but globally this time
[00:49:47.139 --> 00:50:00.144]  And I think the globe is rebelling against that, and that's the real underlying reason between these riots in Greece, and Iceland, and Ireland, and France, and all these other places where people are standing up and saying they recognize what's going on.
[00:50:00.184 --> 00:50:01.844]  They've seen the guy behind the curtain.
[00:50:01.864 --> 00:50:08.767]  They realize it's all a scam that's designed to reduce them to being indentured servants for the rest of their life.
[00:50:09.167 --> 00:50:10.548]  And they're fighting back against it.
[00:50:10.648 --> 00:50:13.689]  And as I said, I don't understand why we're not seeing it here in the U.S.
[00:50:13.729 --> 00:50:13.869]  yet.
[00:50:14.775 --> 00:50:16.916]  Well, Mike, I can pull up the mainstream news articles.
[00:50:16.956 --> 00:50:27.040]  I'm sure you've seen them, where they've proposed putting serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or the Prozac class of drugs, which are also fluoride-based, for those that don't know, in the water supply.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.561]  They just manipulate the fluoride molecule, according to scientists we've interviewed.
[00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:38.285]  Uh, and so, um, and for some reason there are much higher levels of these drugs in water supplies where it shouldn't even be there.
[00:50:38.665 --> 00:50:40.086]  You know, these are water supplies, many of them.
[00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:45.629]  I've seen the articles where there isn't runoff from sewage, from humans, you know, putting it into the sewage system.
[00:50:45.849 --> 00:50:47.770]  So why is it there in high levels, Mike?
[00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:49.071]  You think an Easter Bunny put it there?
[00:50:50.331 --> 00:50:54.554]  Well, I'm not sure, but I know you can't go in and examine the water systems these days.
[00:50:55.774 --> 00:50:56.835]  Government loves us, don't they?
[00:50:58.766 --> 00:51:00.267]  They really care about us a lot, folks.
[00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:01.268]  Drink lots of tap water.
[00:51:01.288 --> 00:51:04.931]  You see all the TV ads saying, drink tap water, it's safe, it's good.
[00:51:04.951 --> 00:51:07.113]  They also tell you corn syrup's good.
[00:51:07.133 --> 00:51:09.495]  It's filled with mercury, of course.
[00:51:09.515 --> 00:51:10.897]  Stay with us.
[00:51:11.607 --> 00:51:19.693]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:51:19.873 --> 00:51:24.256]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:51:24.436 --> 00:51:28.939]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:51:29.099 --> 00:51:30.500]  It's a documented fact.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:37.983]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:51:38.144 --> 00:51:49.989]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder also known as FPP with your favorite beverage once a day.

[00:52:11.588 --> 00:52:13.609]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:52:13.749 --> 00:52:16.050]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.270]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:19.971]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:21.611]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:52:21.711 --> 00:52:24.532]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:52:24.572 --> 00:52:28.234]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:52:37.877 --> 00:52:42.804]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:52:44.026 --> 00:52:45.127]  An inside job.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.620]  How dare you?
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:54.042]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:52:54.062 --> 00:52:56.843]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:52:56.943 --> 00:53:03.125]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:54:18.648 --> 00:54:25.490]  You know, I mentioned that 90% of baby formula has melamine that attacks their brains and kidneys and every other organ.
[00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:28.211]  I mentioned this a week and a half ago.
[00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:29.571]  I got emails not believing it.
[00:54:29.631 --> 00:54:30.992]  It's in hundreds of publications.
[00:54:31.352 --> 00:54:33.953]  Study finds high fructose corn syrup contains mercury.
[00:54:34.573 --> 00:54:34.853]  Half
[00:54:36.668 --> 00:54:46.869]  55 popular brand-name foods, breads, cookies, everything with high-fructose corn syrup has mercury in it and they don't know why because it's not involved in the manufacturing at any point.
[00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:49.666]  It's being added, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:50.207 --> 00:54:55.410]  They have found it is the ultimate chemical weapon, heavy metal, because other heavy metals just create plaques.
[00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:57.331]  Mercury continues to kill.
[00:54:57.631 --> 00:54:58.512]  Seen the movie Alien?
[00:54:58.912 --> 00:55:01.554]  When it drips, the acid just keeps burning through the whole of the ship.
[00:55:01.974 --> 00:55:03.315]  That's what it does electrochemically.
[00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:03.615]  Bam!
[00:55:03.635 --> 00:55:03.855]  Bam!
[00:55:03.875 --> 00:55:04.095]  Bam!
[00:55:04.135 --> 00:55:04.355]  Bam!
[00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:04.996]  Chain reaction.
[00:55:05.256 --> 00:55:07.397]  Just keeps killing, keeps killing, keeps killing.
[00:55:07.657 --> 00:55:08.758]  You're brain damaged.
[00:55:09.018 --> 00:55:09.879]  I'm brain damaged.
[00:55:10.179 --> 00:55:11.480]  I would have been genius level.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.961]  I'm just average intelligence.
[00:55:13.341 --> 00:55:14.542]  I have chemical lobotomy.
[00:55:15.302 --> 00:55:16.783]  And I'm not joking when I say that.
[00:55:16.863 --> 00:55:18.664]  This is chemical warfare.
[00:55:18.704 --> 00:55:19.564]  We have it in the U.N.
[00:55:19.584 --> 00:55:20.244]  zone documents.
[00:55:20.565 --> 00:55:24.346]  We have it from top globalists 80, 90 years ago saying they were going to do this.
[00:55:24.687 --> 00:55:31.150]  And as scary as it sounds, Mike Rivera, why do half the brand names have high levels of mercury in them when it's not even supposed to be there?
[00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.751]  Mike, is it just the... I mean, again, is it Easter Bunny putting it in there?
[00:55:34.778 --> 00:55:39.583]  Well, it is a mystery why that's going on, and mercury is very contraindicated.
[00:55:39.623 --> 00:55:50.636]  If you've ever heard the expression, mad as a hatter, from the Alice in Wonderland books, it's actually based on a real fact, which was that hat makers would use mercury to prepare the felt
[00:55:51.096 --> 00:55:51.537]  I think so.
[00:56:10.134 --> 00:56:10.514]  I think?
[00:56:29.289 --> 00:56:29.570]  Thank you.
[00:56:44.807 --> 00:56:52.934]  We're going to come back and start going directly to everybody that's holding Mark, Bill, Michael, Dan, Dave, and others that told their number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:56:53.115 --> 00:57:03.264]  For God's sakes, folks, a lot of people at six months start giving their baby sugar, fruit juice drinks that has fructose, corn syrup, even if you don't care about yourself.
[00:57:04.185 --> 00:57:09.770]  And you want to say that mercury isn't in at least half of the products that have it.
[00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:10.851]  It's in thousands of products.
[00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:13.210]  At least care about your children.
[00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:15.411]  Mercury is not good for your children.
[00:57:15.491 --> 00:57:18.132]  It is deadly poison and attacks their brains.
[00:57:18.672 --> 00:57:21.614]  And so that's another big reason we're seeing autism go up so high.
[00:57:22.394 --> 00:57:24.915]  But you look at the Amish, no known cases.
[00:57:25.455 --> 00:57:32.999]  In Illinois, where they did a study, a university study of over 200,000 Amish over a decade, no cases of it.
[00:57:33.179 --> 00:57:36.921]  Because they don't eat corn syrup, they don't take vaccines,
[00:57:38.928 --> 00:57:43.073]  It's a fact, ladies and gentlemen, you do not want mercury in your brain.
[00:57:43.114 --> 00:57:43.654]  Mike Rivera.
[00:57:44.585 --> 00:58:10.864]  Absolutely, it's highly toxic and again we have seen such recklessness with products being put out on the market and I remember you were mentioning melanin before when it was a big stink when it was showing up in these Chinese products and then all of a sudden it turned up in American manufactured baby food products and the FDA comes out and says, oh well we've changed our mind and certain amounts are acceptable and safe and coincidentally the safe level was set just above what all the American manufacturers were using.
[00:58:11.184 --> 00:58:13.645]  And it turned out the American manufacturers, they're dying.
[00:58:13.685 --> 00:58:15.065]  Tens of thousands in hospitals.
[00:58:15.585 --> 00:58:18.085]  Tens of thousands, you know, in hospitals, thousands dying.
[00:58:18.566 --> 00:58:22.286]  And then here they just say, oh, we're even worse than China, but it's now good for you.
[00:58:22.746 --> 00:58:23.907]  Dying is good.
[00:58:25.687 --> 00:58:26.707]  Talk about mad as a hatter.
[00:58:26.727 --> 00:58:28.668]  I think the people running things are mad as hatters, Mike.
[00:58:29.588 --> 00:58:30.808]  I think they're drunk on their power.
[00:58:31.948 --> 00:58:34.249]  Well, I mean, it's the ultimate psycho power trip.
[00:58:35.191 --> 00:58:37.713]  What does the Joker do in the first Batman movie?
[00:58:37.733 --> 00:58:41.175]  He puts poison in the cosmetics and in the food.
[00:58:42.196 --> 00:58:48.159]  See, and then they say, just like the Gulf of Tonkin in that movie, throwing it in your face in Hollywood.
[00:58:48.399 --> 00:58:49.780]  We'll be right back with Mike Rivero.
[00:58:52.982 --> 00:58:56.385]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:56.405 --> 00:58:58.226]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:01.476 --> 00:59:03.037]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:03.157 --> 00:59:07.760]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.661]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:10.861 --> 00:59:13.723]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:13.903 --> 00:59:18.626]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:18.846 --> 00:59:19.787]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:19.988 --> 00:59:22.912]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:23.232 --> 00:59:30.121]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:30.221 --> 00:59:33.365]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:50.636 --> 00:59:52.457]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.131]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:09.451]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:16.573]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.233 --> 01:00:18.293]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.994 --> 01:00:20.094]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.754 --> 01:00:21.574]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:23.235]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.255 --> 01:00:27.596]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.076 --> 01:00:32.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.646 --> 01:00:37.587]  There's a lot of other news I haven't even gotten to.
[01:00:37.647 --> 01:00:39.609]  Mike's with us for another 20-30 minutes or so.
[01:00:39.989 --> 01:00:43.832]  Let's go to your phone calls and see what important issues the callers bring up.
[01:00:44.312 --> 01:00:52.017]  Mark, up in the Great White North, having record cold, below zero temperatures nationwide during this incredible global warming.
[01:00:53.218 --> 01:00:59.482]  Volcanoes are going off everywhere, which will put out more than all human activity in history, each one, but we'll get into that with Mike Rivera later as well.
[01:01:00.102 --> 01:01:02.124]  Mark, in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:01:02.184 --> 01:01:02.524]  Welcome.
[01:01:03.184 --> 01:01:04.445]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:01:04.725 --> 01:01:05.306]  Thanks for calling.
[01:01:05.819 --> 01:01:11.503]  Okay, a couple of things I just want your listeners to hear, and then I'll get into it.
[01:01:12.484 --> 01:01:29.176]  First off, here in Canada, I've seen only one time where they've announced that we've already got one guy in British Columbia who has the avian bird flu, and they've already destroyed about 80,000 turkeys and chickens, four farms across British Columbia.
[01:01:30.056 --> 01:01:35.400]  Now, I'm going to get into what I believe are three important dates that everybody needs to look into.
[01:01:36.297 --> 01:01:41.779]  February 10, which is the date that HR 4040 goes into effect.
[01:01:42.739 --> 01:01:48.921]  February 17, which is when the United States is going to switch from analog to digital.
[01:01:49.721 --> 01:01:52.942]  And February 19 is when Barack Obama is coming to Canada.
[01:01:53.582 --> 01:01:56.403]  I believe that these are pieces to a puzzle I've put together.
[01:01:57.243 --> 01:02:01.725]  Simply, when you switch over from analog to digital, it serves two purposes.
[01:02:02.465 --> 01:02:02.545]  One,
[01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:09.718]  It frees up the analog signal for the rescue squads, the police, and the firemen to have more bandwidth.
[01:02:10.378 --> 01:02:19.240]  And I believe it's also a way to track everybody through the RFID chip, because analog signals go through, radio frequency goes through walls and buildings.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:25.482]  And in the digital signal, you can hide subliminal messages to keep the sheep asleep.
[01:02:25.622 --> 01:02:30.043]  Well, that's been admitted with, I mean, it's all very effective, even old television.
[01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:31.583]  I just don't like to
[01:02:32.677 --> 01:02:34.919]  I mean, I'll look at a pattern like massing U.S.
[01:02:34.939 --> 01:02:41.325]  troops around Afghanistan, the news introducing Obama, you know, as the savior, you know, years ago.
[01:02:41.985 --> 01:02:43.987]  You'll see things like that and be able to trend it.
[01:02:44.467 --> 01:02:48.271]  But looking at dates, I see this over and over again, people putting dates on things.
[01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:55.036]  You know, July 25th I went on air and said they're going to attack the World Trade Center, they're going to blame it on some of bin Laden.
[01:02:56.209 --> 01:03:01.134]  And I was able to go on air and say in the next few months I believe this is going to happen, call the White House, tell them don't do it.
[01:03:01.434 --> 01:03:02.855]  But I couldn't put dates on it.
[01:03:03.416 --> 01:03:04.857]  Mike Rivero, you want to comment on this?
[01:03:05.978 --> 01:03:21.233]  Yeah, it's very hard to put dates on it because usually when people are planning these kinds of covert operations, whether it's 9-11 or various assassinations, they'll put the plans in place and then they'll wait for an opportune moment, or what they think is an opportune moment, and very often
[01:03:21.713 --> 01:03:25.215]  It'll be like the night before, the day before, and they'll say, yeah, we're going to go tomorrow.
[01:03:25.756 --> 01:03:31.459]  And so it's really rather hard to say a particularly given date is when something is going to happen.
[01:03:31.779 --> 01:03:34.621]  We know that the U.S.
[01:03:34.661 --> 01:03:38.924]  government is probably considering some kind of a false flag attack to kick off a new war with Iran.
[01:03:39.344 --> 01:03:41.566]  We just don't know when it's going to happen.
[01:03:41.826 --> 01:03:47.790]  One of the frustrating things about fighting against war itself is you never know when you've won, only when you fail.
[01:03:48.869 --> 01:04:04.900]  Absolutely, and at the same time, the fact that 9-11 truth is so huge and international, the fact that it's now in the mental meme and lexicon, it's now in the dictionary, you know, false flag, staged terror, self-inflicted wound, that has damaged their tool.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:13.666]  But there's other false flags, economic false flags, we're in one now, an economic 9-11, the bio-attack, I do believe is one of the chief things, they can claim it, came out,
[01:04:14.468 --> 01:04:19.010]  You know, incidentally, accidentally, that it came from pigs or sheep or cows or chickens or goats.
[01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:24.552]  And then still it'll be the government that organizes that and uses that to control.
[01:04:24.572 --> 01:04:33.335]  Take the foot and mouth release in 2000 that took over most of the cows and sheep and the government killed them in England, those that weren't even infected.
[01:04:33.715 --> 01:04:36.696]  It turned out the government released that and it was a weaponized form.
[01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:38.137]  Then they said it was an accident.
[01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:41.318]  We don't know how it got out of the Level 4 Bioweapons Lab, Mike.
[01:04:42.506 --> 01:04:47.430]  Well, we know that the anthrax sent with the anthrax letters was also weaponized anthrax from a U.S.
[01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:47.810]  lab.
[01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.511]  It wasn't from the Mideast at all.
[01:04:50.732 --> 01:04:52.793]  And they denied that, but now they've been forced to admit that.
[01:04:54.334 --> 01:04:55.035]  We were right again.
[01:04:55.135 --> 01:04:55.715]  Thank you, caller.
[01:04:55.735 --> 01:04:56.376]  Appreciate the call.
[01:04:56.396 --> 01:04:57.397]  We'll watch those dates, though.
[01:04:59.058 --> 01:05:04.322]  Let's now go to Bill, Michael, Dan, Dave, and others when we get back after this quick break with Mike Rivero.
[01:05:04.462 --> 01:05:05.222]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:05:11.815 --> 01:05:15.098]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[01:05:15.338 --> 01:05:17.700]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[01:08:12.876 --> 01:08:18.899]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.561]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:28.684 --> 01:08:31.346]  By the way, I just thought of this because Rob reminded me.
[01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:38.550]  I was watching Super Bowl ads in the airport before I flew back Sunday.
[01:08:40.257 --> 01:08:45.602]  And it's Alec Baldwin talking about how the TV set by design has destroyed half your brain cells.
[01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:46.663]  It's going to destroy the other half.
[01:08:46.963 --> 01:08:49.285]  And he goes, I'm also a reptoid alien ruling the earth.
[01:08:49.305 --> 01:08:51.347]  So it's a direct attack on David Icke.
[01:08:52.947 --> 01:09:00.911]  And then another ad, and again I was sitting there 30 minutes in pre-game stuff at the airport, so that's all I saw.
[01:09:02.051 --> 01:09:05.493]  Another one about high fructose corn syrup, it's so good for you, nutritious.
[01:09:05.753 --> 01:09:08.514]  There's lying conspiracy theorists that say it isn't good.
[01:09:09.054 --> 01:09:20.840]  Doesn't matter if literally hundreds of studies show that the way its molecules are designed, it's not like regular sugar, it goes into the liver that metabolizes it and the body then doesn't say I'm full,
[01:09:22.937 --> 01:09:23.778]  You're still hungry.
[01:09:23.798 --> 01:09:27.161]  So that's one reason they put it in things.
[01:09:27.462 --> 01:09:29.424]  Not just that it's cheap, but it makes you eat more.
[01:09:30.931 --> 01:09:34.513]  And it also has been directly linked in a bunch of studies of diabetes.
[01:09:34.573 --> 01:09:36.193]  It fries your body.
[01:09:36.313 --> 01:09:42.016]  It's chemically extracted and manufactured and then carried around these big tankers on the trains.
[01:09:42.796 --> 01:09:47.639]  And it's put in most foods now that are processed, along with everything else, the MSG, the other excitotoxins.
[01:09:47.739 --> 01:09:50.020]  Aspartame is in most candies that aren't even sugar-free.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:50.960]  They just add it.
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.521]  Look on the back of your gum or your candy.
[01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:54.802]  They're putting it in candy bars now, chocolate bars.
[01:09:55.714 --> 01:09:56.714]  They know what it does.
[01:09:57.094 --> 01:09:58.515]  They know people won't eat it now.
[01:09:58.755 --> 01:10:02.095]  People are saying no to Diet Coke, which is a drug, by the way, an excitotoxin.
[01:10:03.036 --> 01:10:04.036]  So they're moving on to other things.
[01:10:04.316 --> 01:10:08.457]  And now they're running TV ads, going, oh, people are lying about it.
[01:10:08.517 --> 01:10:09.357]  It's really good.
[01:10:09.737 --> 01:10:19.879]  Mike, that shows we're having an effect on them, that there's all these ads on TV now about how wonderful vaccines are and how it's a lie that they're not good for you and how it doesn't cause autism.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.600]  This shows they're really getting desperate, aren't they?
[01:10:24.437 --> 01:10:25.699]  Yeah, absolutely it does.
[01:10:25.899 --> 01:10:39.736]  There's a new show out called The Beast, starring Patrick Swayze, and in one of their first episodes they had a 9-11 truth activist, but they portrayed him as just this completely wacko-bananas character, and it's just part of that general smearing.
[01:10:40.096 --> 01:10:43.821]  But yeah, they're absolutely afraid, they're losing their grip on the minds of America,
[01:10:44.361 --> 01:10:52.307]  And so yeah, it's going to be demonization and smearing and all they're doing is they're raising people's awareness because it's the band in Boston effect.
[01:10:52.627 --> 01:10:57.411]  People are going to start tuning into the websites and say, you know, I want to find out what all the fuss is about.
[01:10:58.091 --> 01:11:07.138]  They're, you know, Roland Emmerich's new film 2012, apparently Woody Harrelson is playing a radio show host who's always predicting disaster and doom.
[01:11:07.538 --> 01:11:21.389]  And he says he's got the curse of Cassandra on him and I'm getting emails from people saying that it sounds like this Woody Harrelson character is based either on you or on me and uh... you know I'm waiting to see whether he'll be treated as a serious character or if they're just gonna make him a goofball.
[01:11:21.469 --> 01:11:26.813]  You know I actually was in a movie, Scanner Darkly, with Woody Harrelson and he has hung out with him a lot.
[01:11:26.893 --> 01:11:28.954]  He is totally anti-New World Order.
[01:11:29.575 --> 01:11:31.316]  He knows all about the globalists.
[01:11:31.737 --> 01:11:34.118]  He knows all about how the government ships the narcotics in.
[01:11:34.419 --> 01:11:35.640]  He's very very smart.
[01:11:36.941 --> 01:11:38.562]  And he gave me his card.
[01:11:38.642 --> 01:11:41.544]  This is how not into stars I am.
[01:11:41.584 --> 01:11:45.227]  Back then I didn't realize how important it was to have them on air because it really gets the buzz going.
[01:11:45.247 --> 01:11:46.728]  People then tune in to see what the deal is.
[01:11:47.489 --> 01:11:48.690]  I don't know where the card is.
[01:11:49.751 --> 01:11:52.353]  Chuck Norris gave me his number and email.
[01:11:53.013 --> 01:11:57.076]  I, last night, woke up and went, my God, Chuck Norris gave me his contact.
[01:11:57.497 --> 01:11:58.898]  I never even gave it to the producer.
[01:11:59.138 --> 01:12:01.400]  And I got up in the middle of the night, went and dug out the book.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.522]  And got, you know, not the producer contacted, the publicist, but found it.
[01:12:05.722 --> 01:12:07.743]  So I've got to remember to use all these contacts.
[01:12:08.643 --> 01:12:10.484]  But side issue from Chuck Norris.
[01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:17.654]  The point is, is that Woody Harrelson is completely and totally anti-New World Order.
[01:12:17.794 --> 01:12:21.977]  And I need somebody call me with his best contact in Maui.
[01:12:21.997 --> 01:12:25.359]  I guess I could call Willie Nelson, but I don't like calling him and bugging him for phone numbers.
[01:12:25.499 --> 01:12:27.961]  I had Woody Harrelson's number.
[01:12:28.461 --> 01:12:33.024]  Then I was contacted about a year ago by his office saying, are you in California?
[01:12:33.044 --> 01:12:33.924]  Somebody thought I lived there.
[01:12:34.425 --> 01:12:35.906]  Can you come see Woody?
[01:12:36.426 --> 01:12:39.928]  And then when I called back a day later, they said, oh, yeah, no, he had to go to something else.
[01:12:39.948 --> 01:12:41.209]  I never really tracked it down.
[01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:46.832]  I don't have time to network with these people, but it's important, so I need to reach out to Woody Harrelson.
[01:12:48.613 --> 01:12:49.373]  Is the point of the rant.
[01:12:51.835 --> 01:13:02.520]  Well, to get back to the media coverage, yeah, they're very nervous, they're very scared, they see the poll numbers indicating that America has lost faith in the corporate media.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.662]  They're turning to the alternative media because they want to go where they think they're going to find the truth.
[01:13:07.322 --> 01:13:11.145]  And certainly looking at my numbers, they continue to go up.
[01:13:11.185 --> 01:13:12.447]  Your numbers continue to go up.
[01:13:12.787 --> 01:13:18.031]  And yet every day we hear about traditional newspapers having to let people go, cut back on their editions.
[01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:21.194]  We hear TV news programs are losing their audience.
[01:13:22.235 --> 01:13:23.636]  The trend is definitely there.
[01:13:24.096 --> 01:13:35.266]  And as the media gets into this survival mode, I expect we're going to see a lot of just outright bashing and attacks and smears coming from their side of the room.
[01:13:36.258 --> 01:13:46.380]  Also, they're admitting, in a lot of policy reports we've covered here with the Internet, too, and the Internet 2 Consortium admits they have a plan to shut down the old web, force us onto a controlled web.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.801]  I want to get to that after calls.
[01:13:49.001 --> 01:13:50.581]  Let's go to Bill in Iowa.
[01:13:50.621 --> 01:13:51.942]  Bill, you're on the air with Mike Rivero.
[01:13:52.002 --> 01:13:52.322]  Welcome.
[01:13:53.442 --> 01:13:55.542]  Yeah, thank you for taking my call.
[01:13:56.883 --> 01:14:00.864]  Two brilliant minds together, Alex Jones and Mike Rivero.
[01:14:03.388 --> 01:14:04.889]  Small town of Iowa.
[01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:14.052]  Oh, by the way, I'm a longtime listener and a TV member, and I have been doing my homework.
[01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:19.013]  We migrated up here from Lake Charles, Louisiana, because of my work.
[01:14:20.314 --> 01:14:31.798]  And since we lived, I've been living here, I go to city council meetings and I've been sharing your DVDs and material and getting a lot of people around here.
[01:14:33.038 --> 01:14:45.161]  Kind of wake up a little bit, and I actually, probably 50% of the homes in this little town had Ron Paul signs in their yard during the primary.
[01:14:46.261 --> 01:14:50.762]  Anyway, about the Second Amendment, I have a small collection.
[01:14:57.003 --> 01:15:01.104]  Whenever you have a president that can't prove citizenship, that to me...
[01:15:04.205 --> 01:15:18.152]  I'm very passionate in what I believe in, and I believe in the Constitution of the United States, and I'm prepared to defend that to the end, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:15:18.632 --> 01:15:21.373]  Now besides that, I have a very important question.
[01:15:21.974 --> 01:15:26.236]  Years ago, in 2004, you had a guest on your show.
[01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:30.899]  His name was retired Colonel Don D. Grand Prix.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:31.580]  Yes.
[01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:40.948]  And I listened to that interview and I was highly impressed that you had the transcript on your website and I printed that out.
[01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:49.235]  And he said, wasn't he a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at one time?
[01:15:49.536 --> 01:15:50.477]  He was assigned to it.
[01:15:51.517 --> 01:15:52.959]  Okay.
[01:15:53.359 --> 01:15:53.980]  He said that
[01:15:55.017 --> 01:16:18.491]  He was in communication on a weekly basis with friends of his that work in the Pentagon and he said that 70, I believe it was 70% of the highest ranking military people were on our side and he believed that they were going to
[01:16:22.122 --> 01:16:27.049]  Yes, I'm wondering what happened to that and another thing is it just blows my mind that there is no
[01:16:37.364 --> 01:16:44.649]  It seems to me like there is some people in the military, higher ups, with some integrity.
[01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:45.490]  No, I hear you.
[01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:49.873]  Let me comment on it, because we've got to get to other callers, and you're a great caller, but I've got to move on here.
[01:16:49.893 --> 01:16:50.714]  It's a very important point.
[01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:53.576]  I tried to get Colonel Donna Grand Prix back on.
[01:16:53.596 --> 01:16:55.818]  He'd had major heart problems.
[01:16:55.838 --> 01:16:58.740]  I don't want to get into his things he told me privately.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.663]  He didn't say don't tell people, but I don't like getting into people's medical problems.
[01:17:03.243 --> 01:17:09.172]  He was in serious medical trouble four or five years ago and couldn't come back on
[01:17:11.738 --> 01:17:16.300]  Then I talked to his wife, and I'm not even sure if he, well, we need to call and try to find out.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:24.503]  So, before I forget, will you go tell Joey, our new producer, to look in my phone numbers, or to do a Google search, Colonel Don DeGranpre.
[01:17:24.883 --> 01:17:31.206]  If anybody else knows his location, or how he's doing, or whether he's alive, or what's going on with an email.
[01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:33.727]  So we set Joey up an email, we need to get that done.
[01:17:34.407 --> 01:17:36.208]  We'll set up Joey at Infowars.com.
[01:17:36.628 --> 01:17:41.110]  But Aaron has just got back into town today from New York interviewing for the Obama film,
[01:17:44.574 --> 01:17:47.097]  The person he went to interview there in New York, Gerald Cilente.
[01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:53.145]  Also, CC, if you know where he is, folks, to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:17:53.826 --> 01:17:55.108]  But, any comments on Col.
[01:17:55.148 --> 01:17:55.989]  Donna Graham-Premike?
[01:17:57.646 --> 01:18:02.287]  Um, actually I've not been following his particular issue as closely as I'd like to.
[01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:04.388]  So, sadly, no.
[01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:11.250]  Yeah, he was a guy, and a lot of it flushed out, who named the name of the pilot who shot down 93 and did say that it was in order to shoot it down.
[01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:14.071]  So he got into all that.
[01:18:14.331 --> 01:18:15.591]  Let's go to another caller here.
[01:18:16.271 --> 01:18:17.812]  Let's talk to Michael in Mass.
[01:18:17.912 --> 01:18:18.812]  Michael, you're on the air.
[01:18:18.832 --> 01:18:20.672]  Hey, how's it going guys?
[01:18:21.372 --> 01:18:21.953]  Good, go ahead.
[01:18:23.913 --> 01:18:26.694]  Well, we're talking about the great shift that appears to be happening.
[01:18:27.321 --> 01:18:33.286]  Western Society, and I wanted to read you guys a quote going all the way back to the 30's.
[01:18:33.326 --> 01:18:36.029]  It was in William Shriver's Berlin Diary.
[01:18:36.549 --> 01:18:40.933]  He was an American journalist in Berlin during the Nazi takeover.
[01:18:41.554 --> 01:18:45.257]  And he was talking to someone... Didn't he write Rise and Fall of the Third Reich?
[01:18:45.897 --> 01:18:46.918]  Yeah, that was his big work.
[01:18:47.359 --> 01:18:47.939]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.320]  This is incredible.
[01:18:50.441 --> 01:18:54.425]  He's talking to a man whose parents were German, but he was an American.
[01:18:54.793 --> 01:18:55.393]  Here it goes.
[01:19:24.989 --> 01:19:25.470]  We're good to go.
[01:19:45.334 --> 01:19:47.255]  Stan, I don't want to hear this quote when we come back.
[01:19:47.775 --> 01:19:54.177]  Finish the quote up or recap it and we'll get Mike Rivero's take with you and then go to more phone calls.
[01:19:54.197 --> 01:19:57.318]  I'm going to play some of these Super Bowl ads and analyze and critique them.
[01:19:57.358 --> 01:19:58.559]  A ton of other news coming up.
[01:19:59.039 --> 01:20:01.520]  We've got an hour and 40 minutes left in transmission.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.561]  It's going to be completely jam-packed.
[01:20:03.641 --> 01:20:05.081]  Remember, how do we reach more people?
[01:20:05.561 --> 01:20:09.803]  One easy thing you can do is spread the word about this radio show, however you're listening.
[01:20:11.963 --> 01:20:12.323]  Good day.
[01:20:12.463 --> 01:20:14.044]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:20:14.285 --> 01:20:15.545]  February 3rd, 2009.
[01:20:16.106 --> 01:20:17.987]  Gold opened this morning at $9.0580.
[01:20:18.107 --> 01:20:23.030]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.3208, $4.6604 for a half ounce, and $2.3302 for the quarter ounce.
[01:20:23.050 --> 01:20:23.571]  That's $9.3208, $4.6604, and $2.3302.
[01:20:30.155 --> 01:20:43.940]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes and servicing debt?
[01:20:44.181 --> 01:20:45.181]  Is this capitalism?
[01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:52.764]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:53.004 --> 01:20:53.984]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:54.105 --> 01:20:58.586]  I'm placing a free silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:20:58.787 --> 01:20:59.707]  Call for your copy.
[01:20:59.727 --> 01:20:59.967]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:00.027 --> 01:21:04.589]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:21:04.689 --> 01:21:05.510]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:08.291]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:17.875]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:21:18.255 --> 01:21:19.916]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:21:20.891 --> 01:21:21.911]  But who is the enemy?
[01:21:22.432 --> 01:21:22.912]  Bin Laden.
[01:21:23.252 --> 01:21:24.212]  This is his M.O.
[01:21:24.233 --> 01:21:25.573]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:21:25.593 --> 01:21:27.254]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:21:27.594 --> 01:21:34.337]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:21:34.737 --> 01:21:35.177]  Some U.S.
[01:21:35.217 --> 01:21:40.880]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.061]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:21:45.081 --> 01:21:47.222]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:22:11.963 --> 01:22:17.427]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:22:17.467 --> 01:22:17.988]  and the world.
[01:22:18.268 --> 01:22:21.730]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:22:22.131 --> 01:22:28.355]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:22:28.635 --> 01:22:30.417]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:22:30.657 --> 01:22:38.603]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:22:38.863 --> 01:22:43.310]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:22:43.571 --> 01:22:49.119]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.403]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:53.827]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:22:54.147 --> 01:22:54.947]  Free of charge.
[01:22:55.248 --> 01:22:58.009]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[01:22:58.029 --> 01:22:59.590]  1-800-453-2202.

[01:23:11.257 --> 01:23:14.919]  When times get tough, we must all decide what's most important in life.
[01:23:15.219 --> 01:23:20.182]  At EnduringRose.com, we believe that lasting relationships are what make life most meaningful.
[01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:24.951]  Showing our loved ones that we care is what helps us find happiness in an uncertain world.
[01:23:25.491 --> 01:23:26.792]  Enduring Rose can help.
[01:23:27.172 --> 01:23:33.295]  We have taken real roses, the universal symbols of love, and coated them in eternal and precious 24 karat gold.

[01:24:03.591 --> 01:24:03.971]  That's 702-453-7455.
[01:24:23.613 --> 01:24:32.756]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to a hundred and three.
[01:24:34.397 --> 01:24:38.219]  A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid.
[01:24:39.899 --> 01:24:43.360]  So, Cyrus Jones, live forever.
[01:24:43.701 --> 01:24:44.801]  Grave Digger.
[01:24:45.061 --> 01:24:46.382]  Grave Digger.
[01:24:46.802 --> 01:24:49.643]  We are back live, Michael Barrow with this reporting after.
[01:24:50.223 --> 01:24:51.864]  Continue taking your phone calls.
[01:24:56.307 --> 01:25:03.494]  Mike was asking me during the break what my numbers were, if I could give him some info on Prozac and other drugs in the water in Hawaii.
[01:25:04.715 --> 01:25:07.018]  What I know is, over the years, we have seen
[01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:24.265]  Government reports where the cities won't even let private groups test it and even try to block other state agencies from testing water supplies.
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:27.840]  And I've seen different numbers.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.061]  The AP does a report every year of just hundreds and hundreds of U.S.
[01:25:31.101 --> 01:25:37.383]  cities with massive amounts of Prozac, Ritalin, birth hormones from the birth control pills.
[01:25:37.823 --> 01:25:50.966]  But in a lot of cities, you can go pull these up, they found water supplies not connected to water treatment or, you know, not toilet to tap, where you don't have sewage involved in the water cycle, so it shouldn't be there and it's there.
[01:25:51.006 --> 01:25:53.307]  You can pull that up, but it is interesting, Mike, isn't it?
[01:25:54.414 --> 01:26:04.782]  Yeah, it really is, and one of the reasons I was asking about Hawaii is there's a long history of government experimentation here in the islands because we're so remote from the mainland.
[01:26:04.842 --> 01:26:08.965]  If something goes really bad, they figure, you know, it's isolated.
[01:26:08.985 --> 01:26:14.610]  A lot of people don't realize this, but Agent Orange, the Vietnam-era defoliant, was actually developed
[01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:15.290]  Absolutely.
[01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:16.310]  Let's go to some calls.
[01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:18.011]  Michael and Matt, you're on the air with Mike Rivero.
[01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:40.330]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:41.931]  I'm actually the guy who was reading that quote.
[01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:45.072]  Let me just finish it up real quick.
[01:26:45.373 --> 01:26:46.793]  About Mr. Scherer, go ahead.
[01:26:47.333 --> 01:26:53.876]  Yeah, you know, they were talking about it in the context of the Finns repelling the attack of the Russians, who at the time was Germany's friend.
[01:26:55.277 --> 01:27:03.461]  And the last sentence in this is, in other words, for a German to defend his country's liberty and independence is right.
[01:27:03.821 --> 01:27:06.322]  For a Finn to do the same is wrong.
[01:27:06.843 --> 01:27:10.025]  Because it disturbs Germany's relations with Russia.
[01:27:10.206 --> 01:27:13.248]  The abstract idea there is missing in the German mentality.
[01:27:13.568 --> 01:27:14.609]  Apply this to today.
[01:27:15.069 --> 01:27:20.954]  People think it's okay to basically turn Iraq into a parking lot because, you know, we're fighting for freedom.
[01:27:22.395 --> 01:27:23.316]  It's double think.
[01:27:24.416 --> 01:27:26.278]  We're allowed to torture, but they're not.
[01:27:27.705 --> 01:27:30.947]  Our politicians are allowed to not pay taxes, but the citizens have to.
[01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:31.988]  It's double think.
[01:27:32.028 --> 01:27:32.629]  Mike Rivera?
[01:27:32.649 --> 01:27:34.150]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:35.511]  It's a blatant double standard.
[01:27:35.971 --> 01:27:41.135]  And what they're trying to do is to make the interests of the state become the new morality.
[01:27:41.495 --> 01:27:45.238]  Instead of saying it's wrong to kill, it's wrong to steal, it's wrong to covet.
[01:27:45.518 --> 01:27:48.300]  No, I was just going to say, Mike, you hit the nail on the head.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.781]  That is exactly what I was getting to.
[01:28:14.237 --> 01:28:20.782]  Just like Alex is talking about, and I'm sure he's going to talk about in his new film, they are really evolving this thing into Obama worship.
[01:28:20.842 --> 01:28:27.186]  I mean, if we start to basically ascribe our morality in terms of what's best for the nation,
[01:28:28.021 --> 01:28:34.204]  You know, it's going to justify a lot of horrible things for which the infrastructure is already in place.
[01:28:34.344 --> 01:28:37.365]  And that's another lie in the system.
[01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:42.287]  We're not doing all these evil things for the American people.
[01:28:42.367 --> 01:28:43.768]  We're paying for the empire.
[01:28:43.808 --> 01:28:45.429]  We're losing our liberties.
[01:28:46.349 --> 01:28:49.772]  Being the center of an empire is always one of the worst places to be.
[01:28:50.093 --> 01:28:53.375]  So there's, I mean, I've heard good old boys go, yeah, we're in there for the oil, so what?
[01:28:53.836 --> 01:28:56.038]  You know, them dirty Iraqis don't deserve it.
[01:28:56.058 --> 01:28:56.678]  We're good.
[01:28:57.199 --> 01:28:59.541]  Don't they understand that they're not going to be getting that oil?
[01:28:59.621 --> 01:29:03.364]  Even if they were an immoral person, this elite is getting rid of our sovereignty.
[01:29:04.165 --> 01:29:10.111]  I mean, I have articles where they're now announcing that the California pension funds are bankrupt.
[01:29:10.131 --> 01:29:11.212]  The people just aren't going to get their money.
[01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:13.294]  The globalists have looted everything.
[01:29:13.795 --> 01:29:18.139]  And just like the Germans thought they were Hitler's buddy and that they were going to do great.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.522]  In the end, he decried the German people, Mike.
[01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:24.245]  Yeah, and we saw the same thing in Russia under Stalin.
[01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:28.893]  All the Russian people who supported him in his rise to power, he turned on them and double-crossed them.
[01:29:28.913 --> 01:29:30.716]  He called them all useful idiots.
[01:29:31.377 --> 01:29:34.282]  And, you know, tyrants have no respect for the people who support them.
[01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:36.205]  Look at the Night of the Long Knives in Germany.
[01:29:38.735 --> 01:29:42.798]  Mike Rivera is our guest, final segment straight ahead, more of your phone calls, great points Michael.
[01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:46.001]  Dan, Dave, Mike, you'll be the final caller for Mike Rivera.
[01:29:46.321 --> 01:29:49.544]  Then a ton of other news including Super Bowl propaganda ads.
[01:29:50.024 --> 01:29:58.191]  We're going to break these down and analyze them here on the one and only GCN Radio Network in association with Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:01.894 --> 01:30:04.797]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:05.806 --> 01:30:08.588]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.611 --> 01:30:17.255]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:30:17.455 --> 01:30:22.599]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:30:22.879 --> 01:30:27.963]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:30:28.263 --> 01:30:30.025]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[01:30:34.148 --> 01:30:40.152]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:30:40.372 --> 01:30:43.915]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:30:44.175 --> 01:30:48.698]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:30:48.998 --> 01:30:49.779]  Do your part.
[01:30:50.039 --> 01:30:52.300]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[01:30:52.661 --> 01:30:58.785]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:30:59.085 --> 01:31:03.327]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:31:03.487 --> 01:31:05.168]  And we knew what to do.
[01:31:05.288 --> 01:31:06.588]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:12.651]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:31:29.005 --> 01:31:36.008]  EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:31:36.328 --> 01:31:43.132]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:31:43.432 --> 01:31:46.513]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:31:46.593 --> 01:31:51.856]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:31:52.376 --> 01:31:54.917]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:31:55.453 --> 01:32:01.301]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:32:01.501 --> 01:32:04.044]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:32:04.425 --> 01:32:09.331]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:32:11.075 --> 01:32:14.460]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:19.827]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:32:20.007 --> 01:32:24.713]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:32:26.015 --> 01:32:36.320]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:42.223]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:32:42.443 --> 01:32:48.506]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:32:48.706 --> 01:32:49.367]  What about you?
[01:32:49.747 --> 01:32:53.849]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[01:33:02.995 --> 01:33:03.796]  We won't be left behind.
[01:33:04.036 --> 01:33:05.738]  Our memories live on in mortal mind.
[01:33:28.963 --> 01:33:31.365]  Okay, let's go straight back to your phone calls here.
[01:33:33.747 --> 01:33:37.950]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Ohio.
[01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.831]  You're on the air, Dan.
[01:33:38.851 --> 01:33:40.612]  Hi, Alex.
[01:33:40.652 --> 01:33:41.553]  Dan from Ohio.
[01:33:42.374 --> 01:33:43.074]  Welcome.
[01:33:43.415 --> 01:33:44.335]  First time caller.
[01:33:45.216 --> 01:33:48.519]  And Mike, this is also an important subject.
[01:33:48.539 --> 01:33:49.420]  This is a pre-interview.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.941]  I've been on hold for quite some time.
[01:33:52.162 --> 01:33:56.025]  Is anyone there yet familiar with the New Hampshire House of
[01:33:57.745 --> 01:33:59.285]  Concurrent resolution number six.
[01:34:01.026 --> 01:34:04.246]  It's about as close to an article of succession that I've seen.
[01:34:04.266 --> 01:34:11.887]  It's also been recommended by the state of Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Virginia.
[01:34:13.508 --> 01:34:17.408]  Basically, in summation, they are drawing a line in the sand.
[01:34:17.428 --> 01:34:20.829]  As far as I understand here, there are six articles at the bottom.
[01:34:22.489 --> 01:34:25.930]  Many of those being further infringements of the right to keep and bear arms, including
[01:34:27.943 --> 01:34:36.461]  Uh, prohibiting the type and quantity of arms and ammunition, any act regarding religion, fertile limitations of freedom of political speech, and fertile limitations of the freedom of the press.
[01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:42.112]  And it goes on, enforcing martial law without the general consent of the state legislator.
[01:34:42.132 --> 01:34:44.673]  Basically... Let me stop you.
[01:34:44.693 --> 01:34:45.213]  Let me stop you.
[01:34:45.553 --> 01:34:46.414]  I'm not aware of this.
[01:34:46.474 --> 01:34:47.454]  I'm not omnipresent.
[01:34:48.155 --> 01:34:52.757]  Specifically, I know that New Hampshire invoked right to revolt Article 10.
[01:34:52.997 --> 01:34:54.278]  I mean, I'm aware of the article.
[01:34:54.298 --> 01:34:55.319]  I just didn't know they invoked it.
[01:34:55.999 --> 01:34:58.440]  Article 10 had been invoked in the month before 9-11.
[01:34:59.932 --> 01:35:02.996]  They were going to have a state convention on September 12th.
[01:35:03.016 --> 01:35:05.719]  I'm not saying they carried out the attack because of that.
[01:35:06.881 --> 01:35:11.727]  Because there, the cities and counties themselves can make the states secede.
[01:35:11.787 --> 01:35:12.889]  That's originally in there.
[01:35:12.909 --> 01:35:15.512]  The states are on top of the federal government.
[01:35:15.532 --> 01:35:17.574]  They claim that the Civil War decided that.
[01:35:18.749 --> 01:35:23.071]  For the Feds, but the Feds are completely illegitimate and controlled by offshore banks through a corporate takeover.
[01:35:23.511 --> 01:35:27.654]  Specifically, you're saying this is Article 6, where and what are they saying?
[01:35:28.054 --> 01:35:32.116]  Just Google HCR 6 and it'll be the first thing that comes up.
[01:35:32.216 --> 01:35:33.276]  It just came out yesterday.
[01:35:33.477 --> 01:35:34.897]  House Concurrent Resolution?
[01:35:34.917 --> 01:35:36.178]  6, yes.
[01:35:36.838 --> 01:35:40.660]  Okay, House Concurrent Resolution 6 in New Hampshire.
[01:35:41.281 --> 01:35:44.442]  Yes, 2009 session.
[01:35:44.482 --> 01:35:47.664]  Now, has this been introduced or has this gotten sponsors and being brought forward?
[01:35:48.368 --> 01:35:51.431]  It's sponsored by several representatives and Senator Denley.
[01:35:53.012 --> 01:35:56.956]  The House Concurrent Resolution affirms states' rights based on Jeffersonian principles.
[01:35:57.416 --> 01:36:00.279]  Okay, I'm going to get these state reps on immediately.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.063]  So, House Concurrent Resolution 6, New Hampshire, and we'll call all the sponsors.
[01:36:05.083 --> 01:36:07.265]  You'll probably hear them here tomorrow.
[01:36:07.305 --> 01:36:08.186]  In fact, we just found it.
[01:36:08.606 --> 01:36:10.448]  We're going to punch it up on screen here in just a moment.
[01:36:10.528 --> 01:36:10.968]  Thank you.
[01:36:11.509 --> 01:36:12.870]  Thank you for calling with that info.
[01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:14.231]  Mike Rivero, your take on this.
[01:36:14.992 --> 01:36:35.408]  Yeah, I had heard of this because I am from New Hampshire originally and basically all of these resolutions, and we're seeing a lot of them start up now, they're all reaffirmations of the Declaration of Independence and the very principles by which this country threw out the last government and said we're going to be a new nation that is founded on these principles of freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to be armed,
[01:36:36.248 --> 01:36:37.269]  It's a great show.
[01:36:53.755 --> 01:37:03.559]  And so I would think that as we saw with the fall of Rome, as the central government bankrupts itself, the outlying provinces, or in this case states, start to break away and assert their independence.
[01:37:03.859 --> 01:37:06.320]  And I think ultimately that's what we're going to see happen to the United States.
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:09.801]  And I want to be clear, I'm for the union, but it isn't a union.
[01:37:09.841 --> 01:37:15.083]  We have to break apart first to come back together, if the people so choose.
[01:37:15.103 --> 01:37:19.485]  Because the globalists, as they did in China 150 years ago, the same system here,
[01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:23.473]  Starting with phony drugs they shipped in to then break down the society.
[01:37:24.134 --> 01:37:25.155]  That's mainline history.
[01:37:26.391 --> 01:37:27.691]  They're going to break us up.
[01:37:27.751 --> 01:37:28.752]  That's what globalism is.
[01:37:29.032 --> 01:37:40.314]  They merge larger units in the continental unions to then break up and destroy the sovereignty of the original units into smaller parts through balkanization.
[01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:46.256]  So we've got to break apart ourselves if we're ever going to reconstitute the Republic.
[01:37:46.296 --> 01:37:48.616]  And I can't see how Hawaii couldn't break away.
[01:37:49.076 --> 01:37:51.537]  Well, that was less than, you know, a hundred years ago.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.260]  That they killed a bunch of the royal family.
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:55.341]  I mean, you live there.
[01:37:55.381 --> 01:37:56.861]  Tell folks briefly the story about that.
[01:37:56.881 --> 01:38:02.982]  Well, basically, the United States illegally annexed Hawaii during the Spanish-American War.
[01:38:03.422 --> 01:38:11.784]  And in 1993, President Bill Clinton signed a public law of apology acknowledging that the Hawaiian people had never really surrendered their national sovereignty.
[01:38:12.164 --> 01:38:15.484]  So technically, on paper, there is still a nation of Hawaii.
[01:38:15.784 --> 01:38:18.585]  There are several groups arguing over who should be in charge of it.
[01:38:19.345 --> 01:38:25.429]  But the bottom line is that were there to be a major economic upheaval on the mainland, there's a very strong movement.
[01:38:26.410 --> 01:38:34.455]  Not necessarily to secede because they're not acknowledging that statehood is legal to begin with, but there's certainly a strong independence movement here in Hawaii.
[01:38:36.236 --> 01:38:36.857]  Absolutely.
[01:38:37.097 --> 01:38:37.837]  Great call, sir.
[01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:40.940]  Appreciate you calling in with that information, Dan.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:43.441]  Quickly, Dave in Florida, then Mike in New York.
[01:38:43.461 --> 01:38:44.202]  We'll let Mike go.
[01:38:44.842 --> 01:38:45.382]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:38:45.402 --> 01:38:45.863]  You're on the air.
[01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:52.542]  Yeah, hey, I just wanted to follow up on that, about these gun bills.
[01:38:55.103 --> 01:39:01.865]  I think it was a confusion earlier when they were saying that Al C. Hastings had introduced H.R.
[01:39:01.885 --> 01:39:01.865]  45.
[01:39:02.665 --> 01:39:12.328]  It looks like it was Bobby Rush from, I bet you can guess, from District 1 in Illinois.
[01:39:12.768 --> 01:39:16.449]  Wait, I did see Hastings' name on the bill when I covered it last week.
[01:39:17.631 --> 01:39:18.852]  I think that was the FEMA camp.
[01:39:18.872 --> 01:39:21.636]  I came in here, I'm not complaining, but somebody cleaned my desk off this weekend.
[01:39:21.656 --> 01:39:23.237]  Where is the stack of stuff that was here last week?
[01:39:36.232 --> 01:39:36.853]  Bring it in to me.
[01:39:37.293 --> 01:39:38.775]  Dig through it and find me the gun bills.
[01:39:39.135 --> 01:39:40.676]  Because I said that at the start of the show.
[01:39:40.736 --> 01:39:42.338]  I said, I don't have the bills in front of me.
[01:39:42.718 --> 01:39:43.779]  Then the caller called in.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:45.721]  So we gotta be careful about this.
[01:39:45.741 --> 01:39:47.263]  But yes, he introduced the FEMA camp bill.
[01:39:47.583 --> 01:39:48.464]  Now remember, you're right.
[01:39:50.306 --> 01:39:52.308]  Regardless, call him and tell him we don't want the FEMA camp bill.
[01:39:53.874 --> 01:39:54.534]  Right, yeah.
[01:39:54.974 --> 01:39:58.395]  What I wanted to say was, yesterday when you had that congressman... No, no, no, no, no, wait a minute.
[01:39:58.415 --> 01:39:59.035]  We weren't wrong.
[01:39:59.635 --> 01:40:00.776]  Mike did call.
[01:40:00.796 --> 01:40:03.616]  It was caller Mike from Montana.
[01:40:04.376 --> 01:40:06.557]  He called and said it was the FEMA bill.
[01:40:06.917 --> 01:40:07.917]  People need to call him.
[01:40:08.237 --> 01:40:09.017]  So we were right.
[01:40:09.578 --> 01:40:13.679]  Then, another caller called in and said here's his number on the gun bill.
[01:40:14.019 --> 01:40:15.159]  So it was the caller that was wrong.
[01:40:15.179 --> 01:40:15.459]  Go ahead.
[01:40:16.758 --> 01:40:16.958]  Right.
[01:40:17.699 --> 01:40:25.685]  But that congressman yesterday, when he was talking about Alcee Hastings, and if you look at this guy Bobby Rush, you just wonder, you know, where do they come up with this stuff?
[01:40:26.226 --> 01:40:34.453]  And that congressman yesterday said, you know, he knew Alcee... Your phone cut out, sir.
[01:40:34.513 --> 01:40:35.594]  You're on an IP phone, right?
[01:40:35.634 --> 01:40:35.974]  Go ahead.
[01:40:37.375 --> 01:40:38.076]  Hey, he's gone.
[01:40:38.696 --> 01:40:39.077]  Go ahead.
[01:40:40.378 --> 01:40:42.760]  Yeah, he said he knew Alcee Hastings and
[01:40:43.482 --> 01:40:50.007]  He knew that he was really dirty and they had a lot of stuff on him so they could get him to introduce anything.
[01:40:50.808 --> 01:40:55.811]  I think everybody uses that word, they, so much.
[01:40:55.871 --> 01:40:58.693]  How can we unmask?
[01:40:59.054 --> 01:41:03.897]  Let me tell you, and I appreciate the call, I'm going to let Mike go in a moment, I want him to be able to comment on this.
[01:41:05.012 --> 01:41:06.914]  They is the military-industrial complex.
[01:41:06.974 --> 01:41:09.837]  It's the big lobbying interests that are all in support of globalism.
[01:41:10.257 --> 01:41:29.916]  They combine their forces together to buy off government, to remove the checks and balances from the people, remove our power over the system, and give it to themselves so they can use governments to shut down their political competition, their economic, their industrial, their scientific competition, and so they can extract more and more wealth from the people and social engineer us.
[01:41:30.496 --> 01:41:38.463]  So, that's who they are, and yesterday I listed a bunch of Trilateral Commission people in Obama's administration and who were neocons and things.
[01:41:38.483 --> 01:41:40.885]  So, we are listing who they are.
[01:41:41.306 --> 01:41:45.469]  But if all we did was list they, we had Rothkopf that wrote the book Superclass.
[01:41:45.489 --> 01:41:48.672]  He says there's 6,000 globalists, run everything, they want world government.
[01:41:49.113 --> 01:41:49.673]  He was here.
[01:41:49.753 --> 01:41:51.655]  It's in the New York Times.
[01:41:52.235 --> 01:41:53.917]  That's two questions and I'm going to let Mike go.
[01:41:57.406 --> 01:41:58.387]  You know, who are they?
[01:41:58.508 --> 01:42:05.378]  And then B, why are they suddenly in hundreds of newspapers a week going, you know, North American Union's the answer to the crises.
[01:42:06.099 --> 01:42:08.642]  Oh, you know what, FEMA camps are the answer to all of this.
[01:42:08.682 --> 01:42:11.606]  You know, why are they now admitting what they've denied so long?
[01:42:11.647 --> 01:42:12.448]  Those two questions, Mike.
[01:42:13.464 --> 01:42:15.927]  Well, they obviously is the little clique.
[01:42:15.967 --> 01:42:22.735]  If you remember back in high school, there was always the clique of beautiful rich people who sort of got away with everything and looked down on everyone else.
[01:42:23.115 --> 01:42:25.077]  Well, it's the same thing, only grown up.
[01:42:25.117 --> 01:42:33.287]  And now they're in Congress, and now they're in the media, and now they're basically all working together to basically, as you said, extract real wealth from the ordinary people.
[01:42:33.687 --> 01:42:38.911]  As for the reason why they're going public with it right about now, I think it goes back to what you said earlier in the show.
[01:42:39.331 --> 01:42:40.512]  There's a degree of panic.
[01:42:40.532 --> 01:42:46.476]  They're beginning to recognize they don't have the iron grip on the minds of America that they thought they did once before.
[01:42:46.796 --> 01:42:47.917]  So now they're having to come up.
[01:42:48.357 --> 01:42:48.877]  It's a pitch.
[01:42:48.937 --> 01:42:49.858]  It's a sales pitch.
[01:42:50.118 --> 01:42:52.860]  They're out here trying to sell us that these are really good things to do.
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:57.643]  And like I said before, the public is aware globalism got us into this mess.
[01:42:58.103 --> 01:43:02.946]  Selling globalism as the cure-all, that's a really, really tough sell, and they're pushing it as hard as they can.
[01:43:03.246 --> 01:43:10.110]  And it really is a war between they and their advertising PR agencies, and we, who have the truth on our side.
[01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:12.091]  And the first one to quit loses.
[01:43:14.272 --> 01:43:15.153]  And that's it, Mike.
[01:43:16.374 --> 01:43:18.275]  They denied all this while they were building it.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:24.406]  But with the alternative media, we exposed the architecture as it was being developed.
[01:43:25.667 --> 01:43:33.356]  Now, the people are aware of it, so they're forced to go ahead and admit it's all true, but put a spin on it that it will save you from the economic collapse.
[01:43:33.376 --> 01:43:34.318]  But the people go, wait a minute.
[01:43:35.499 --> 01:43:39.564]  You're the ones that did all this, and you promised the last bailout would fix it.
[01:43:40.785 --> 01:43:44.328]  And they'll probably pass another one and another one and announce themselves to be emperors.
[01:43:44.729 --> 01:43:47.391]  But then everybody will see through it that they're a bunch of illegitimate criminals.
[01:43:47.832 --> 01:43:48.593]  Then what happens?
[01:43:49.173 --> 01:43:53.417]  Well, war in the streets and they think their military is going to be able to carry this out.
[01:43:53.437 --> 01:43:55.299]  A lot of military and police aren't going to go along with this.
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:44:00.204]  Even if they're thugs, some of them are not going to like what happens when they go up against the American people.
[01:44:00.844 --> 01:44:02.166]  And they're not going to want to show up to work.
[01:44:04.699 --> 01:44:11.626]  Well, it's not working so far in Europe because those protesters, they've already pulled down the government of Iceland and some of these other governments like Greece.
[01:44:11.666 --> 01:44:13.488]  They're in serious, serious trouble right now.
[01:44:14.208 --> 01:44:16.290]  And I think the same thing is going to happen here.
[01:44:17.423 --> 01:44:19.145]  How do you stop the shark-teeth effect?
[01:44:19.606 --> 01:44:28.316]  We've seen in Argentina and Nigeria and places where the globalists have done this, you know, declassified, it's admitted, bring their economies down economically to consolidate.
[01:44:28.816 --> 01:44:35.744]  And then you'll see five prime ministers, six, seven presidents, in one year as the people figure out, no, he's a puppet, get rid of him.
[01:44:36.024 --> 01:44:37.126]  No, he's a puppet, get rid of him.
[01:44:37.346 --> 01:44:38.406]  No, he's a puppet, get rid of him.
[01:44:38.787 --> 01:44:50.292]  And then finally the governments are just insolvent, but still, the private banks now own the infrastructure, and they have police forces with machine guns guarding it, and the country just sinks into the mud, but the globalists then own the pile of dung.
[01:44:52.210 --> 01:45:01.178]  Well, if you go back and you look at the history of the French Revolution, they talk about the revolution, but there were actually a series of several revolutions as the same thing.
[01:45:01.478 --> 01:45:05.101]  Each new government that came in proved it was just as corrupt as the previous one.
[01:45:05.502 --> 01:45:06.943]  They were brought down and kicked out.
[01:45:07.223 --> 01:45:12.468]  And ultimately, in the French Revolution, the bankers were brought down with the royal families at the same time.
[01:45:12.828 --> 01:45:16.151]  And they basically restarted their economy and their government from scratch.
[01:45:16.571 --> 01:45:18.373]  And I think that's what's going to happen here in the U.S.
[01:45:18.413 --> 01:45:21.015]  I think ultimately the Federal Reserve has to be gotten rid of.
[01:45:21.295 --> 01:45:29.762]  We need to go back to the monetary system that we had when we founded this country, which is a monetary system based on units of value rather than units of debt.
[01:45:30.302 --> 01:45:30.923]  All right, Mike.
[01:45:31.003 --> 01:45:32.804]  Amazing interview today.
[01:45:32.824 --> 01:45:41.051]  I really want to thank you for joining us and we'll see you back next month on the first Tuesday of every month for an hour and a half or so.
[01:45:41.511 --> 01:45:43.232]  And I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[01:45:43.252 --> 01:45:43.573]  Take care.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:44.940]  My pleasure.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:46.461]  There he goes, folks.
[01:45:46.541 --> 01:45:48.321]  WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:45:48.701 --> 01:45:49.041]  All right.
[01:45:49.701 --> 01:45:55.523]  We've got an hour and 14 minutes left in transmission time today.
[01:45:57.803 --> 01:46:11.147]  And I didn't get to a bunch of news articles that I saw yesterday about how they're saying we shouldn't be able to have more than two children, there should be tax incentives to only have one, but if you have more than two, you get fines and fees put on you.
[01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:16.822]  Is how they started the one-child policy in China.
[01:46:17.182 --> 01:46:25.405]  Started in 1974 with a treaty with the United States and the IMF World Bank who paid the communist Chinese to institute it.
[01:46:25.625 --> 01:46:30.106]  They put fines on you and harassed you if you had more than one child.
[01:46:30.687 --> 01:46:32.167]  Then in 1980 it became law.
[01:46:32.587 --> 01:46:34.528]  Now I've told you for years they're going to propose this.
[01:46:34.948 --> 01:46:36.369]  Now I watched a lot of
[01:46:37.748 --> 01:46:46.155]  Television this weekend, which I rarely do, and on show after show after show after show, news shows, they would demonize people with more than one or two children.
[01:46:46.515 --> 01:46:49.197]  So, I mean, there's a whole new level.
[01:46:49.217 --> 01:46:51.499]  It wasn't just that, it was everything was propaganda.
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:56.203]  I saw CNN say, I mean, everything was propaganda.
[01:46:56.724 --> 01:47:00.627]  There was another election in Iraq and finally women got a chance to vote for the first time.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:11.607]  Well, A, it wasn't the first time they've had a chance to vote, and B, Saddam Hussein had more women graduating from college as doctors and lawyers and scientists than men, around 60%.
[01:47:11.667 --> 01:47:19.052]  Saddam Hussein was trying to stop religious Muslims from having women basically cover themselves up.
[01:47:19.532 --> 01:47:21.513]  Saddam Hussein wanted to empower women.
[01:47:21.953 --> 01:47:23.374]  I'm not defending Saddam Hussein.
[01:47:23.755 --> 01:47:26.797]  The point here is that the globalists created the guy.
[01:47:27.037 --> 01:47:31.380]  He actually, though, wanted to progress his country and was making it first world.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.261]  And that's why he had to be stopped.
[01:47:33.301 --> 01:47:36.162]  So, again, the idea is to back up the war.
[01:47:36.222 --> 01:47:36.543]  It was out.
[01:47:36.703 --> 01:47:37.603]  The war is going great.
[01:47:37.643 --> 01:47:38.263]  Less killing.
[01:47:38.303 --> 01:47:39.584]  Very little violence at the elections.
[01:47:39.924 --> 01:47:41.025]  And women get to vote now.
[01:47:43.386 --> 01:47:44.947]  Implying that women never had rights.
[01:47:45.287 --> 01:47:50.470]  Women now have less rights because they put the religious people in control over there.
[01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:52.811]  Which is what the globalists always do.
[01:47:52.911 --> 01:47:54.072]  They overthrew Iran for that.
[01:47:55.305 --> 01:47:58.988]  They don't want secular governments.
[01:47:59.028 --> 01:48:05.172]  The Muslims, the Arabs, the Persians, they want to build giant hotels.
[01:48:05.412 --> 01:48:06.493]  They want to build giant resorts.
[01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:07.694]  They want to build giant factories.
[01:48:07.874 --> 01:48:08.414]  They're smart.
[01:48:08.554 --> 01:48:10.235]  They're just as smart as people in the West, folks.
[01:48:11.716 --> 01:48:12.537]  They're smart.
[01:48:13.497 --> 01:48:14.198]  They want to live.
[01:48:15.139 --> 01:48:15.799]  The British!
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:18.801]  It's the story of Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:48:18.841 --> 01:48:19.662]  That movie's true.
[01:48:20.082 --> 01:48:20.943]  That movie's historical.
[01:48:20.983 --> 01:48:22.223]  That's a historic film.
[01:48:23.024 --> 01:48:23.865]  It's non-fiction.
[01:48:24.915 --> 01:48:29.697]  They went and they found a group of ragtag Bedouins.
[01:48:30.277 --> 01:48:31.898]  I'm not attacking the Bedouins, just a fact.
[01:48:32.358 --> 01:48:38.341]  And they hired them and gave them machine guns and hand grenades and had them go overthrow the governments and then they set up the Middle East.
[01:48:39.021 --> 01:48:40.842]  They set up the countries that are in Saudi Arabia now.
[01:48:41.523 --> 01:48:42.563]  They are British intel.
[01:48:42.583 --> 01:48:44.964]  The Obamas, you know, of the world.
[01:48:47.358 --> 01:48:51.459]  Are nothing but distractions and diversions, just like the Saudi kings of the world are distractions and diversions.
[01:48:51.879 --> 01:48:53.139]  These people are all puppets.
[01:48:53.959 --> 01:48:58.340]  And where do you see so much of the, quote, Muslim terrorism emanating out of Saudi Arabia?
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.181]  15 of the 19 hijackers?
[01:49:03.041 --> 01:49:04.021]  But that's okay.
[01:49:04.421 --> 01:49:08.822]  We need to invade Iraq because they've got women graduating 60% of their new doctors.
[01:49:10.923 --> 01:49:13.023]  You know, they had women in radio and TV everywhere.
[01:49:14.784 --> 01:49:16.384]  They weren't downtrodden in Iraq.
[01:49:16.404 --> 01:49:16.924]  They are now.
[01:49:19.614 --> 01:49:26.317]  So they want radical Muslims in control, ladies and gentlemen, and they did that as a, quote, counterbalance to communism, and they call it a blowback.
[01:49:27.438 --> 01:49:28.979]  And now I'll get threats from those Muslims.
[01:49:28.999 --> 01:49:31.100]  Well, I'm sorry if your leaders are run by the New World Order.
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.080]  It's just a fact.
[01:49:32.381 --> 01:49:37.723]  Now, before I go any further here, I want to tell you about the sponsors of the day.
[01:49:38.744 --> 01:49:41.285]  One is Survivalist Seeds, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.369]  Okay.
[01:50:55.179 --> 01:51:02.429]  We're going to come back and get into a bunch of news, your phone calls, and then I'm going to get into some of these Super Bowl ads and analyze the propaganda.
[01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:09.239]  This is a tiny snapshot of the tapestry, the tissue of brainwashing and conditioning that's going on.

[01:51:11.474 --> 01:51:14.456]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.

[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:22.301]  Be safe.

[01:52:10.562 --> 01:52:17.607]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:52:17.988 --> 01:52:19.629]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:52:20.763 --> 01:52:21.604]  Who is the enemy?
[01:52:22.125 --> 01:52:22.625]  Bin Laden.
[01:52:22.926 --> 01:52:23.887]  This is his ammo.
[01:52:23.907 --> 01:52:25.229]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:52:25.289 --> 01:52:26.951]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:52:27.291 --> 01:52:34.039]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:52:34.439 --> 01:52:34.880]  Some U.S.
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:40.567]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:52:41.267 --> 01:52:44.749]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:52:44.769 --> 01:52:47.570]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:53:11.161 --> 01:53:14.802]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:53:14.862 --> 01:53:20.504]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:53:20.604 --> 01:53:24.645]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:53:24.925 --> 01:53:27.205]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.

[01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:20.899]  This is serious business, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:21.679 --> 01:54:22.519]  Study history.
[01:54:22.539 --> 01:54:29.441]  The majority of the time, hardcore tyrants come in with a lot of flashy propaganda and literally destroy your way of life.
[01:54:30.102 --> 01:54:31.522]  The United States hasn't been perfect.
[01:54:32.882 --> 01:54:36.643]  But we got all this wealth, which made the globalists then try to move here and take over.
[01:54:37.004 --> 01:54:37.964]  Now we're the great evil.
[01:54:38.984 --> 01:54:41.245]  A lot of other corruption, but this is the big place.
[01:54:41.505 --> 01:54:42.885]  This is where the evil emanates from.
[01:54:43.245 --> 01:54:44.546]  This is the main command base.
[01:54:46.215 --> 01:54:52.577]  Because we had liberty and produced so much wealth, the scum all came here to take us over.
[01:54:53.817 --> 01:54:58.699]  To use us as an engine to dominate the planet and take over the world.
[01:54:59.759 --> 01:55:00.720]  And we're in deep trouble.
[01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:04.481]  They're coming for the guns with bills to ban almost every gun in America.
[01:55:06.541 --> 01:55:11.603]  Through executive fiat to say you can't own guns if the White House feels like it, without even having a conviction.
[01:55:13.288 --> 01:55:14.389]  They're building FEMA camps.
[01:55:14.429 --> 01:55:15.830]  It's now all over mainstream news.
[01:55:16.210 --> 01:55:21.613]  They're now admitting the clergy response teams to tell their parishioners to go to the FEMA camps.
[01:55:22.774 --> 01:55:26.936]  They're openly announcing the youth corps, the brigades, the Tattletale squads.
[01:55:27.837 --> 01:55:29.558]  They've even given us a messianic leader.
[01:55:30.959 --> 01:55:31.539]  It's happening.
[01:55:37.903 --> 01:55:38.844]  We're going to, uh,
[01:55:40.287 --> 01:55:43.090]  Go to your phone calls here in a moment, then I'm going to get into these ads.
[01:55:43.951 --> 01:55:57.584]  But first off, ladies and gentlemen, I want to encourage all of the listeners to go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and not just support this radio show and the TV show we're starting and all the work we're doing here.
[01:55:58.737 --> 01:56:04.540]  But also, these are great films that need to be seen, that need to be owned in high quality on DVD, and need to be shown to others.
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:06.401]  The Money Masters, three and a half hour film, 1995.
[01:56:07.662 --> 01:56:12.485]  You want to know who's raping you, you want to know the history of it, and currently what's going on, this is the film to have.
[01:56:14.165 --> 01:56:21.630]  Endgame, the overall Rosetta Stone of understanding the New World Order and what their endgame is, their history, their overall strategy, and what their future plans are.
[01:56:21.930 --> 01:56:23.911]  This is the best film out there, period.
[01:56:24.251 --> 01:56:25.872]  Many people are saying it, I happen to have made it.
[01:56:27.574 --> 01:56:33.658]  Barry Cooper's Never Get Busted Again, at checkpoints, police, speeding, you name it.
[01:56:33.778 --> 01:56:36.700]  Understanding globalist tactics, understanding how they want to undermine your rights.
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:40.522]  Got these two DVDs, discounted right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:40.943 --> 01:56:45.185]  My latest 9-11 film, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, Cinema Verite.
[01:56:46.326 --> 01:56:48.347]  As a director, the best film I've made.
[01:56:49.448 --> 01:56:51.169]  Dealing with just the way the film moves.
[01:56:51.489 --> 01:56:53.411]  No voiceover, just all hardcore info.
[01:56:53.931 --> 01:56:55.515]  And waking a lot of people up.
[01:56:55.916 --> 01:56:58.622]  Fabled Enemies, Jason Bermas' 9-11 film.
[01:56:58.662 --> 01:57:01.729]  Getting into a lot of subjects not covered by others.
[01:57:02.531 --> 01:57:03.914]  So definitely check this out.
[01:57:05.151 --> 01:57:07.013]  And I had one in here, but I guess I don't know where it is.
[01:57:07.394 --> 01:57:08.735]  Eye of the Phoenix just came in.
[01:57:08.795 --> 01:57:09.876]  It just now came out.
[01:57:10.737 --> 01:57:12.840]  Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.462]  Just looking at this one thing.

[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:54.560]  Prison Planet.

[01:58:12.941 --> 01:58:16.164]  We have a major internet firm that does some of the biggest websites out there.

[01:58:30.497 --> 01:58:33.660]  And so that's one of the announcements we have to make that are coming up.
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:39.265]  A lot of others as well, as we expand our operations against the Global Crime Syndicate.
[01:58:39.625 --> 01:58:40.825]  I mean, they're openly the bad guys.
[01:58:40.845 --> 01:58:41.826]  We know who the bad guys are.
[01:58:41.866 --> 01:58:42.546]  We're the good guys.
[01:58:42.866 --> 01:58:46.327]  We need you to join us in this fight for the Republic and humanity worldwide.
[01:58:46.567 --> 01:58:50.268]  The transmission against tyranny continues on the front lines of the Info War.
[01:58:52.769 --> 01:58:54.150]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:54.190 --> 01:58:57.451]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:01.459 --> 01:59:03.040]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:07.783]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:07.903 --> 01:59:10.644]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:10.844 --> 01:59:13.706]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:13.906 --> 01:59:18.609]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:18.849 --> 01:59:19.790]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:22.912]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:23.212 --> 01:59:30.116]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[01:59:30.196 --> 01:59:33.338]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:33.478 --> 01:59:35.359]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[01:59:38.621 --> 01:59:44.705]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:59:44.885 --> 01:59:48.647]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:48.667 --> 01:59:49.968]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:49.988 --> 01:59:50.588]  Take action today.
[01:59:50.628 --> 01:59:52.610]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:00:04.119 --> 02:00:06.020]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:09.342]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.024 --> 02:00:27.833]  If you do a Google search, there are multiple states attempting to pass legislation like New Hampshire.
[02:00:28.113 --> 02:00:30.435]  HCR 6 is introduced in the 2009 session.
[02:00:33.373 --> 02:00:36.116]  We're going to get some of these State Reps on.
[02:00:36.196 --> 02:00:47.590]  Representative Ides, Rock, Ingbertson, Graff, Comford, Delaney.
[02:00:50.712 --> 02:00:52.954]  So, we're going to work on that.
[02:00:53.654 --> 02:00:56.616]  Says we're not going to have martial law, we're not going to have gun confiscation.
[02:00:57.096 --> 02:00:59.898]  And they list what the feds are doing and what they're moving ahead with.
[02:00:59.938 --> 02:01:02.880]  So, the states are rallying, the people are waking up.
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.041]  Shame on Texas.
[02:01:04.441 --> 02:01:05.462]  Shame on Arizona.
[02:01:05.882 --> 02:01:08.744]  Shame on places like Vermont that claim they're so pro-Second Amendment.
[02:01:09.344 --> 02:01:11.765]  Gun owners are delusional, going, my guns are fine.
[02:01:11.805 --> 02:01:25.808]  Barack says, as they introduce the bills to ban every semi-auto, to make you be federally licensed, psychological federal testing, by fiat, they can just claim that you've got a psychological problem.
[02:01:25.848 --> 02:01:27.388]  I mean, this is the end.
[02:01:27.668 --> 02:01:28.968]  And earlier we played Rahm Emanuel.
[02:01:28.988 --> 02:01:36.850]  I'm going to play that again later, because we just played the audio earlier, before we were simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv, where he said, if we think maybe
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:38.780]  You're a terrorist.
[02:01:39.441 --> 02:01:48.765]  So that means if we think maybe you've committed a misdemeanor, because section 802 of terrorism in the Patriot Act says any misdemeanor, you'll be on the no-fly list, you won't build on a gun.
[02:01:48.845 --> 02:01:50.486]  Well, that no-fly list is a criminal list.
[02:01:50.966 --> 02:01:58.951]  Over a million Americans now on it, no judge, no jury, congressmen, senators, business owners, a lot of you are on that list, and it's growing.
[02:01:58.991 --> 02:02:00.131]  It's got to be over a million now.
[02:02:00.151 --> 02:02:02.332]  Last time I saw it six months ago, it was in the news.
[02:02:02.432 --> 02:02:05.794]  Over a million on no-fly list, and over two million on the criminal list.
[02:02:06.374 --> 02:02:07.355]  No conviction, no nothing.
[02:02:08.126 --> 02:02:09.447]  Just total tyranny!
[02:02:10.528 --> 02:02:11.949]  That's what the bad guys do, folks.
[02:02:11.969 --> 02:02:12.829]  They want your guns.
[02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:20.595]  So we're going to work on getting some of these state reps on, so we can spread the word about this happening and other state reps introduce legislation.
[02:02:21.575 --> 02:02:26.119]  Because if the feds announce you're turning your guns in, folks, you better hope your state stands up and says no.
[02:02:26.619 --> 02:02:27.920]  That's the last line of defense.
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.441]  That's why they've been getting rid of the states.
[02:02:33.459 --> 02:02:35.840]  Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[02:02:36.421 --> 02:02:38.402]  Mike in New York, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:02:39.322 --> 02:02:40.283]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:02:40.883 --> 02:02:41.123]  Good.
[02:02:41.884 --> 02:02:43.065]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:02:43.105 --> 02:02:51.529]  God bless you for what you're doing and the information you're releasing to everybody and keeping everybody a little smarter than they normally would be without you.
[02:02:51.590 --> 02:02:59.534]  You were mentioned on George Norrie last night about the FEMA camps and how you've been screaming and yelling about it all these years and no one's been listening to you.
[02:03:00.134 --> 02:03:02.636]  And I think people are starting to wake up little by little
[02:03:03.191 --> 02:03:04.812]  But I think it might be a little too late.
[02:03:05.172 --> 02:03:15.355]  I think that they've just pushed and pushed, and I think that it's a scary world out there, Alex, and it's just getting worse and worse every day.
[02:03:16.296 --> 02:03:17.296]  And I don't know what to do.
[02:03:19.257 --> 02:03:21.557]  Was George talking about how the bills are introduced?
[02:03:21.698 --> 02:03:25.219]  Yeah, Florida introduced a bill.
[02:03:25.239 --> 02:03:31.121]  The senator, I believe, from Florida introduced a bill, and I mean, it's going to pass.
[02:03:32.253 --> 02:03:37.078]  They're just going to stand right up one after the other and vote for it and pass it.
[02:03:37.498 --> 02:03:38.379]  Because they're criminals.
[02:03:38.759 --> 02:03:41.422]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:03:41.742 --> 02:03:43.544]  They have handed us over to foreign banks.
[02:03:43.984 --> 02:03:44.685]  They've looted us.
[02:03:44.725 --> 02:03:46.066]  They're stealing all the pension funds.
[02:03:46.106 --> 02:03:47.468]  As I told you years ago, they were planning.
[02:03:47.868 --> 02:03:48.749]  I read their own documents.
[02:03:49.210 --> 02:03:51.972]  And then they're going to sit there and say, military, attack the people.
[02:03:52.773 --> 02:03:54.455]  They don't like their savings being taken.
[02:03:54.755 --> 02:03:56.577]  The military is going to go, lock and load.
[02:03:57.757 --> 02:03:58.878]  Absolutely, they're all brainwashed.
[02:03:58.918 --> 02:04:01.179]  And we have TV ads going, look at our heroes, look at them!
[02:04:01.419 --> 02:04:04.301]  They'll have rock bands going, they're a, they're a warrior!
[02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:07.963]  Fighting the evil American, yeah, oh yeah!
[02:04:08.583 --> 02:04:26.213]  Scary world out there, we're expecting our first daughter and we're trying, we're going to avoid giving her the vaccinations and thank God for religious exemption and actually New York State is trying to strengthen the religious exemption for vaccinations.
[02:04:27.048 --> 02:04:29.529]  So that's some good news up to that point.
[02:04:29.569 --> 02:04:30.009]  No, no.
[02:04:30.209 --> 02:04:31.350]  The fight is on.
[02:04:31.710 --> 02:04:32.711]  The people know.
[02:04:33.491 --> 02:04:40.474]  Except for, let me see, 57% of voters, or it's almost 60, voted for Barack Obama.
[02:04:40.614 --> 02:04:42.055]  Let's see, 60% voted for Barack Obama.
[02:04:43.516 --> 02:04:44.476]  Well, no, that's not accurate.
[02:04:44.696 --> 02:04:45.276]  Let me get this right.
[02:04:45.697 --> 02:04:48.698]  We had 62% voter turnout.
[02:04:49.598 --> 02:04:52.980]  And close to 60% of the voters voted for Barack Obama.
[02:04:53.951 --> 02:04:56.573]  So, what is 60% of 60%?
[02:04:56.933 --> 02:05:02.278]  We're talking about 35% or so?
[02:05:02.298 --> 02:05:02.278]  37%?
[02:05:02.438 --> 02:05:04.399]  I'm going to get a calculator out.
[02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:06.281]  Of the country voted for Obama.
[02:05:06.881 --> 02:05:07.522]  Anything else, sir?
[02:05:07.542 --> 02:05:09.223]  No, that'll do it.
[02:05:09.263 --> 02:05:10.204]  I appreciate your time.
[02:05:11.101 --> 02:05:11.501]  Appreciate you.
[02:05:41.121 --> 02:05:41.581]  We're good to go.
[02:06:11.576 --> 02:06:17.960]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:20.021]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:06:20.976 --> 02:06:21.996]  But who is the enemy?
[02:06:22.517 --> 02:06:23.017]  Bin Laden.
[02:06:23.317 --> 02:06:24.277]  This is his M.O.
[02:06:24.297 --> 02:06:25.658]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:27.338]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:06:27.678 --> 02:06:34.421]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:06:34.821 --> 02:06:35.261]  Some U.S.
[02:06:35.301 --> 02:06:40.943]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:06:41.643 --> 02:06:45.165]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:06:45.525 --> 02:06:55.391]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:06:55.631 --> 02:06:56.372]  Fabled enemies.

[02:08:05.115 --> 02:08:09.057]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.117 --> 02:08:09.998]  We're in a info war!
[02:08:24.258 --> 02:08:30.900]  Our secret weapon is history, the truth, our honor, our willingness to fight for every person out there to unlock their minds.
[02:08:31.621 --> 02:08:39.823]  The globalists want to keep their minds shut, small, petty, in abject tyranny, just giving in to corruption.
[02:08:40.423 --> 02:08:53.348]  We want to just unlock people's minds so they can look at the world for themselves and assess what's really happening, what's really going on in their area, and to decide if they want to be part of this fight for liberty in history, or if they want evil to be able to take over.
[02:08:55.899 --> 02:09:00.000]  I'm going to say this again, I say this every show, and I'm going to beg the audience now.
[02:09:00.421 --> 02:09:05.142]  The number one thing you can do to fight the New World Order is to spread the word.
[02:09:05.182 --> 02:09:06.143]  And what is most effective?
[02:09:06.203 --> 02:09:06.543]  Films.
[02:09:06.863 --> 02:09:10.184]  So get my films, other films, make copies, have viewing parties, get it out.
[02:09:10.684 --> 02:09:16.646]  Call Congress, go speak to your city council, call your state legislatures, tell them to introduce legislation like New Hampshire did.
[02:09:17.466 --> 02:09:21.368]  Seven states passed bills saying we're not going to follow the Patriot Act, it's un-American.
[02:09:22.259 --> 02:09:24.100]  And instructed their state police not to follow it.
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:31.284]  And instructed their states, because the states are over the counties and cities, told their counties and cities, do not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:09:31.304 --> 02:09:32.184]  It's still in effect here.
[02:09:32.464 --> 02:09:33.985]  Don't use the Patriot Act against U.S.
[02:09:34.025 --> 02:09:34.445]  citizens.
[02:09:34.846 --> 02:09:36.386]  The feds, oh no, we're not doing that.
[02:09:36.867 --> 02:09:39.168]  And then they did, and a lot of states are now using it.
[02:09:40.916 --> 02:09:43.277]  That was all because I had the idea to do that.
[02:09:43.398 --> 02:09:44.618]  People picked it up, ran with it.
[02:09:45.399 --> 02:09:48.541]  People formed organizations in 800 plus cities and seven states did it.
[02:09:49.041 --> 02:09:55.745]  Now this could domino effect what's happening with this House Resolution 6 in New Hampshire.
[02:09:56.346 --> 02:09:57.606]  And other states have similar things.
[02:09:58.327 --> 02:09:59.448]  We've had the state rep on.
[02:10:00.812 --> 02:10:03.394]  Uh, what she's a state senator on, uh, many times.
[02:10:03.414 --> 02:10:08.717]  We need to get her back on, who introduced legislation similar to this years ago, after she saw my film, Police State 2000.
[02:10:09.397 --> 02:10:10.238]  Another example.
[02:10:10.698 --> 02:10:12.619]  We call her up to have her on as a guest, I go, why'd you introduce this?
[02:10:12.699 --> 02:10:14.680]  Oh, I saw Police State 2000, checked it out.
[02:10:15.341 --> 02:10:15.881]  That was back in 2000.
[02:10:17.362 --> 02:10:19.483]  And now she's a big 9-11 truther.
[02:10:20.003 --> 02:10:20.644]  Karen Johnston.
[02:10:21.972 --> 02:10:24.574]  So, other states are doing similar things.
[02:10:24.954 --> 02:10:40.064]  We don't just want to have these introduced, we want to have these passed, saying, we know you're setting up martial law, we know you're setting up tyranny, we know you're engaged in all this corruption, we know you're illegitimate, we are not going to let the feds come in here and take the guns, we are not going to take part in this and go along with this.
[02:10:42.475 --> 02:10:43.075]  It can happen.
[02:10:43.115 --> 02:10:55.839]  You have to believe that it can happen first, and that means you have to form groups, get focused, get the legislation from New Hampshire, and other legislation, put it together, and bring it in, and speak to committees, and shake hands, and get down there.
[02:10:56.159 --> 02:10:57.379]  It can happen.
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:10:59.740]  The people are really listening right now.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:01.661]  A lot of folks in politics are scared.
[02:11:01.721 --> 02:11:02.681]  They know what's going on.
[02:11:03.061 --> 02:11:05.362]  They just want to see people supporting them for what's right.
[02:11:06.371 --> 02:11:08.773]  Now, the big issue is we don't have a choice.
[02:11:09.253 --> 02:11:10.794]  You can say it's a tough road we gotta go down.
[02:11:10.994 --> 02:11:12.535]  Well, the other one's a lot tougher.
[02:11:13.436 --> 02:11:17.258]  I'm not gonna just lay here in a ditch on my knees and put a bullet in my head, and it could come to that.
[02:11:17.879 --> 02:11:18.219]  Now listen.
[02:11:20.188 --> 02:11:22.110]  Another big solution is spreading the word.
[02:11:22.150 --> 02:11:25.293]  There are hundreds of thousands of people that listen every 15 minutes.
[02:11:25.754 --> 02:11:27.856]  Ted's even gotten ratings from our stations before.
[02:11:27.896 --> 02:11:30.118]  It's like 315,000 people for 15 minutes listening.
[02:11:30.719 --> 02:11:31.519]  On just the AM and FM.
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:33.341]  Then shortwave, satellite, internet.
[02:11:33.401 --> 02:11:34.743]  Number one show on Shoutcast.
[02:11:35.103 --> 02:11:38.807]  And now they've changed it where like a third of our streams can be seen.
[02:11:38.847 --> 02:11:40.048]  Before it was half our streams.
[02:11:40.088 --> 02:11:43.872]  Now a third of our streams can be seen on Shoutcast and we're routinely number one.
[02:11:44.372 --> 02:11:47.273]  In talk, and routinely in the top five, period.
[02:11:47.774 --> 02:11:58.158]  And the reason I don't like not being in the top, because we're sending more streams other places, trying to work out the system, is being on the top of shoutcasts, people want to hear what number one is, and it makes more people listen.
[02:11:58.178 --> 02:12:04.981]  So we're working that out, trying to get more of our streams pointed at that, because a lot of them are going through CDNs, not single servers.
[02:12:06.001 --> 02:12:10.483]  But side issue, the point is, it's the kind of stuff I deal with all day.
[02:12:12.722 --> 02:12:17.145]  I want you as listeners to please tell your email list, your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[02:12:17.445 --> 02:12:19.106]  This is a hard-hitting, serious show.
[02:12:19.126 --> 02:12:24.489]  You want to know what's really happening with the corporate takeover, the bailouts, the depression, the gun control, the FEMA camps.
[02:12:25.130 --> 02:12:25.830]  This is the place.
[02:12:25.930 --> 02:12:29.693]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the backup sites, Prison Planet.
[02:12:30.953 --> 02:12:48.917]  .tv is the big video site, Infowars.net, Truthinews.us, Jonesreport.com, and just tell people at red lights, tell them at work, tell them at church, tell them at synagogue or at the mosque or at the golf course or at the bar or at the beach,
[02:12:52.118 --> 02:12:54.079]  Because, I mean, I'm putting everything on the line.
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:56.741]  And whether you know it or not, you're on the line too.
[02:12:56.781 --> 02:12:59.102]  Your butt is hanging out over the edge of a cliff, folks.
[02:12:59.122 --> 02:13:02.184]  The only chance we've got is to claw back and not fall off the side of this cliff.
[02:13:02.444 --> 02:13:04.285]  And I'm clawing, there's blood coming out of my fingernails.
[02:13:04.705 --> 02:13:07.167]  I'm trying, but I can't pull the whole country out behind me.
[02:13:07.567 --> 02:13:09.328]  The listeners we've got now can't do it all.
[02:13:09.608 --> 02:13:10.308]  We need more.
[02:13:10.428 --> 02:13:14.671]  And if you just explosively start telling people about the show, it can exponentially grow.
[02:13:16.118 --> 02:13:17.379]  With the viral videos, all of it.
[02:13:17.399 --> 02:13:20.362]  So I want to commend all of you out there with the viral videos and everybody else spreading the word.
[02:13:20.402 --> 02:13:20.823]  God bless you.
[02:13:20.843 --> 02:13:21.904]  You're doing a fabulous job.
[02:13:21.944 --> 02:13:25.728]  Now, let me shift gears into brainwashing and propaganda.
[02:13:25.748 --> 02:13:28.131]  I've got a bunch of different video clips here.
[02:13:28.651 --> 02:13:30.013]  We have the band Three Doors Down.
[02:13:30.053 --> 02:13:31.154]  I'm a warrior video, right?
[02:13:32.335 --> 02:13:34.197]  It was our anniversary last night.
[02:13:35.058 --> 02:13:36.299]  Took my wife to a movie.
[02:13:37.661 --> 02:13:38.662]  First time I've done that in about a year.
[02:13:40.199 --> 02:13:40.739]  I never have time.
[02:13:40.759 --> 02:13:43.981]  But anyways, I go in there and I heard about this from Jason Burmess.
[02:13:44.421 --> 02:13:47.382]  He said he went and saw a movie last week and it was like, I'm a warrior!
[02:13:47.422 --> 02:13:52.604]  With troops marching through the streets of America, the condition you'd accept troops in the streets and parades and everybody loving them.
[02:13:52.985 --> 02:14:02.069]  That creates the propaganda that the war is good, that you love the troops by loving war, that it's rock star, that it's cool, that young kids can go join the military.
[02:14:03.989 --> 02:14:07.131]  And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[02:14:08.234 --> 02:14:10.315]  So, we're not going to play this first.
[02:14:10.335 --> 02:14:18.538]  We're going to play this citizen-soldier-I'm-a-warrior thing a little bit later in the show, but this is just the most base propaganda there is.
[02:14:18.918 --> 02:14:23.460]  First I want to play, and this isn't the one I saw in the Super Bowl, there's a bunch of these.
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:28.541]  If you go to YouTube, in fact minimize this page, I want to show people right here.
[02:14:29.082 --> 02:14:35.124]  You go to YouTube and you type in high fructose corn syrup ad, you'll get scores of them.
[02:14:36.627 --> 02:14:37.027]  Okay?
[02:14:37.547 --> 02:14:38.568]  And it's all the same.
[02:14:38.648 --> 02:14:42.369]  Somebody's eating high fructose corn syrup and somebody says, Hey, I heard that's not good for you.
[02:14:42.429 --> 02:14:43.169]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[02:14:43.209 --> 02:14:43.989]  Conspiracy theory.
[02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:46.450]  It's absolutely wholesome and delicious from little corn.
[02:14:48.471 --> 02:14:53.293]  So, uh, you can go watch all these if you want, but we're analyzing this one.
[02:14:53.553 --> 02:14:54.393]  Here's the propaganda.
[02:14:57.302 --> 02:14:57.542]  Hey!
[02:14:58.082 --> 02:14:58.682]  Wow.
[02:14:59.302 --> 02:15:00.503]  You don't care what the kids eat, huh?
[02:15:01.143 --> 02:15:01.683]  Excuse me?
[02:15:01.923 --> 02:15:03.584]  That has high fructose corn syrup in it.
[02:15:04.284 --> 02:15:04.424]  And?
[02:15:05.065 --> 02:15:06.025]  You know what they say about it?
[02:15:06.345 --> 02:15:06.825]  Like what?
[02:15:09.567 --> 02:15:10.107]  Hey!
[02:15:11.027 --> 02:15:16.729]  It's... That it's made from corn, doesn't have artificial ingredients, and like sugar, it's fine in moderation?
[02:15:20.311 --> 02:15:20.671]  Hello?
[02:15:20.691 --> 02:15:21.451]  Is that Tom?
[02:15:21.471 --> 02:15:22.452]  Oh, well, thank you.
[02:15:22.492 --> 02:15:23.132]  Get the facts.
[02:15:23.392 --> 02:15:24.833]  You're in for a sweet surprise.
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:28.321]  Okay, there were no facts there.
[02:15:28.941 --> 02:15:36.864]  There were no facts there, but the image is, the trendy, cool, you know, lady knows what's going on, this dumb idiot comes over and says, what are the facts?
[02:15:36.884 --> 02:15:40.086]  And she's like, uh-uh, uh-uh, I don't know any, uh-uh.
[02:15:40.826 --> 02:15:42.807]  And all the ads are the same, it's pure pressure.
[02:15:43.447 --> 02:15:52.509]  And they have weird ads demonizing the Second Amendment, weird ads demonizing national sovereignty, and weird ads out there I'm seeing where somebody will go, I just, I just hate black people.
[02:15:52.529 --> 02:15:53.910]  And by the way, I love the Second Amendment.
[02:15:53.950 --> 02:15:58.151]  You know, just guilt by association type stuff is now everywhere.
[02:15:58.171 --> 02:16:05.873]  In fact, let's click on another one of the, before we go to the Alec Baldwin ad, let's click on one more of those high fructose corn syrup ads.
[02:16:05.913 --> 02:16:06.213]  Here we go.
[02:16:14.406 --> 02:16:15.927]  Yeah, I know there's no audio.
[02:16:16.307 --> 02:16:17.587]  YouTube's shutting down.
[02:16:17.607 --> 02:16:20.808]  That's because they clicked it before it did upload.
[02:16:20.828 --> 02:16:21.268]  Want a bite?
[02:16:22.109 --> 02:16:23.409]  I thought you loved me.
[02:16:23.429 --> 02:16:23.689]  I do.
[02:16:23.749 --> 02:16:24.369]  Take two bites.
[02:16:24.970 --> 02:16:26.650]  It's got high fructose corn syrup in it.
[02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:27.190]  So?
[02:16:27.551 --> 02:16:28.531]  Well, you know what they say about it.
[02:16:29.391 --> 02:16:29.691]  What?
[02:16:30.271 --> 02:16:37.514]  That... It's... It... Um... That it's made from corn?
[02:16:38.054 --> 02:16:40.915]  Has the same calories as sugar, honey, and it's fine in moderation.
[02:16:42.396 --> 02:16:43.036]  You only brought one?
[02:16:45.936 --> 02:16:46.576]  Get the facts.
[02:16:46.836 --> 02:16:48.337]  You're in for a sweet surprise.
[02:16:48.717 --> 02:16:55.661]  Okay, so there's ad, after ad, after ad, after ad, after ad, after ad, after ad, after ad, all over TV, the Super Bowl.
[02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:57.522]  That's the one I've seen on the Super Bowl.
[02:16:57.962 --> 02:16:58.902]  And it's the same thing.
[02:16:59.663 --> 02:17:01.544]  That corn syrup, I heard that's not good.
[02:17:01.724 --> 02:17:02.044]  Oh, really?
[02:17:02.064 --> 02:17:02.844]  You heard it's not good?
[02:17:03.205 --> 02:17:03.785]  What's your facts?
[02:17:05.346 --> 02:17:07.887]  And always, he's the guy wanting the girl.
[02:17:08.087 --> 02:17:09.488]  Have you seen the ads where they hold up a beer?
[02:17:10.248 --> 02:17:13.451]  And it's a hot chick, and you're really wanting her.
[02:17:13.732 --> 02:17:18.357]  But the association is the Coors Light, or the Budweiser, or whatever, with the woman.
[02:17:19.571 --> 02:17:21.992]  Basic psychology, basic advertising 101.
[02:17:22.652 --> 02:17:32.756]  Well, here it's the good-looking girl, beautiful day, the popsicles in a sunny day, under the shade, perfect, giggling background noises because it's primitive, you know, creatures.
[02:17:33.036 --> 02:17:35.356]  We like the sound of giggling children and happy people.
[02:17:35.777 --> 02:17:38.458]  And there's a sound of rustling wind.
[02:17:39.118 --> 02:17:41.138]  You know, that was a target men who want a mate.
[02:17:41.679 --> 02:17:45.140]  And associating at the primitive level, you will get the mate.
[02:17:46.738 --> 02:17:48.620]  And the red lollipop symbolizes sex.
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:51.101]  The red popsicle.
[02:17:51.602 --> 02:17:52.723]  Red is the symbol of sex.
[02:17:53.744 --> 02:17:54.704]  Folks, I took advertising.
[02:17:54.744 --> 02:17:55.825]  This is psych warfare, okay?
[02:17:56.446 --> 02:17:57.607]  And they're sitting there with it.
[02:17:58.387 --> 02:18:00.429]  So it's a tasty-looking popsicle.
[02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:02.571]  It symbolizes sex in the Freudian school.
[02:18:02.811 --> 02:18:04.212]  They have several other schools in there.
[02:18:04.852 --> 02:18:06.714]  There's the giggling children, the happiness.
[02:18:07.214 --> 02:18:08.315]  This is the Garden of Eden.
[02:18:08.335 --> 02:18:11.558]  And in the middle of the Garden of Eden is this fruit growing, this red fruit.
[02:18:11.878 --> 02:18:12.819]  It is the red popsicle.
[02:18:13.678 --> 02:18:24.227]  And then at the intellectual level, he's an idiot, he shot his mouth off, but she showed him, the woman, now for the woman she sees this, and the girl's giggling up above him, like the goddess.
[02:18:25.228 --> 02:18:28.511]  I just covered how it affects the man, the psych warfare on his angle.
[02:18:28.711 --> 02:18:40.902]  For the woman, she's up above him in the garden, she's happy, the sound of giggling children, she has the popsicle, it's the center of everything, and she shows that she's more knowledgeable and lovingly giggles at the fool.
[02:18:42.199 --> 02:18:46.344]  Now there's other layers to this, but I just covered it, basically.
[02:18:47.726 --> 02:18:49.268]  This is what they're doing everywhere.
[02:18:50.506 --> 02:18:53.348]  And they have different types of propaganda they use, and they interwove them.
[02:18:53.949 --> 02:18:56.471]  Now when we come back, I'm going to play Alec Baldwin.
[02:18:56.831 --> 02:18:58.192]  Ah, Alec Baldwin!
[02:18:59.013 --> 02:19:00.734]  Ah, you will be very useful to me.
[02:19:00.754 --> 02:19:03.817]  I'm going to ask Max Keiser, he's friends with Alec Baldwin.
[02:19:03.837 --> 02:19:05.338]  I'm going to ask Charlie Sheen, I know they're friends.
[02:19:06.359 --> 02:19:16.267]  Alec, I know they got you to do this because it's a joke, funny ad, but TV eats your brain, but we're going to eat the rest of your brain with the TV, and by the way, I'm a reptoid.
[02:19:17.273 --> 02:19:29.247]  Now, now when people talk about TV frying your brain, or being used to condition and control you, as we're just now illustrating, they will then say, oh yeah, I saw that Alec Baldwin Super Bowl commercial.
[02:19:29.988 --> 02:19:33.232]  You see, they're making a joke out of all of this.
[02:19:33.272 --> 02:19:34.353]  They're making it funny.
[02:19:34.934 --> 02:19:35.715]  But it's not funny.
[02:19:36.690 --> 02:19:38.110]  By the way, corn syrup.
[02:19:38.190 --> 02:19:39.351]  I can give you thousands of facts.
[02:19:39.391 --> 02:19:40.731]  I'm not the idiot in the ad.
[02:19:41.171 --> 02:19:41.892]  I can give you facts.
[02:19:41.912 --> 02:19:43.652]  Here's Washington Post, January 28th, 2009.
[02:19:44.412 --> 02:19:46.693]  Study finds high fructose corn syrup contains mercury.
[02:19:46.993 --> 02:19:52.675]  Half of 55 popular brands have high levels of mercury in it, even though it's not involved in the manufacturing process.
[02:19:52.695 --> 02:19:53.975]  I mean, zoom in over here.
[02:19:54.436 --> 02:19:55.496]  I want to show people this.
[02:19:55.816 --> 02:19:59.217]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:19:59.257 --> 02:20:01.158]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehyde?
[02:20:19.364 --> 02:20:19.825]  That's right.

[02:21:13.413 --> 02:21:15.814]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:21:15.834 --> 02:21:17.935]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:21:18.095 --> 02:21:19.636]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:21:19.656 --> 02:21:21.257]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:21:21.377 --> 02:21:24.198]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:21:24.259 --> 02:21:27.900]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:21:37.552 --> 02:21:42.481]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:21:43.703 --> 02:21:44.805]  An inside job.
[02:21:46.198 --> 02:21:47.319]  How dare you?
[02:21:47.679 --> 02:21:53.703]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:21:53.723 --> 02:21:56.525]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:21:56.625 --> 02:22:02.769]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[02:22:02.789 --> 02:22:05.651]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:22:05.951 --> 02:22:07.912]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:22:08.192 --> 02:22:10.674]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:22:11.388 --> 02:22:15.289]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:22:15.509 --> 02:22:27.772]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:22:28.192 --> 02:22:28.612]  The U.S.
[02:22:28.653 --> 02:22:34.174]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:22:34.614 --> 02:22:36.835]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:22:37.596 --> 02:22:39.757]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:22:39.797 --> 02:22:42.638]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:22:42.758 --> 02:22:48.781]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:22:49.221 --> 02:22:52.563]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:22:52.643 --> 02:22:58.966]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[02:22:59.546 --> 02:23:03.567]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[02:23:03.667 --> 02:23:04.447]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:05.627 --> 02:23:09.288]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:13.169 --> 02:23:18.470]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[02:23:18.910 --> 02:23:20.670]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[02:23:21.210 --> 02:23:22.691]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[02:23:23.331 --> 02:23:24.991]  Everyone needs something to give that extra
[02:23:30.503 --> 02:23:30.863]  I think so.
[02:23:41.971 --> 02:23:42.752]  Great to see you!
[02:24:17.205 --> 02:24:19.366]  Again, zoom in on this for the viewers out there.
[02:24:19.846 --> 02:24:33.431]  You see all these TV ads telling you that porn serve isn't bad for you when there's all these mainline studies from universities, medical studies, showing that you eat it and then you're still hungry.
[02:24:33.471 --> 02:24:34.151]  So it makes you eat more.
[02:24:34.171 --> 02:24:34.952]  It makes you obese.
[02:24:35.792 --> 02:24:37.152]  It is linked to diabetes.
[02:24:37.192 --> 02:24:38.493]  It has all sorts of problems.
[02:24:40.006 --> 02:24:50.165]  And so they're running ads to condition the public, and then it turns out half of 55 major brands of food with corn syrup in it, that 55 they tested, half of them had high levels of mercury.
[02:24:51.343 --> 02:25:01.810]  And they just say here at the end of the article, the bad news is that nobody knows whether or not their soda or snack food contains HFCs made from ingredients like caustic soda contaminated with mercury.
[02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:03.691]  They use a toxic waste soda.
[02:25:04.091 --> 02:25:06.993]  The good news is that mercury-free HFC ingredients exist.
[02:25:07.353 --> 02:25:11.516]  Food companies just need a good push, a push, we gotta push them, to only use these ingredients.
[02:25:12.136 --> 02:25:12.757]  And it goes on.
[02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:20.352]  Products bought off the shelf in the autumn of 2008 had mercury in them.
[02:25:21.092 --> 02:25:23.573]  So, again, study finds high fructose corn syrup contains mercury.
[02:25:24.073 --> 02:25:27.454]  So, oh, honey, you're eating corn syrup.
[02:25:27.954 --> 02:25:29.275]  Well, what's your facts, Alex?
[02:25:30.055 --> 02:25:32.416]  Corn syrup comes from corn and is nutritious.
[02:25:32.436 --> 02:25:35.697]  Oh, God, you're so smart.
[02:25:35.997 --> 02:25:36.817]  I don't have any facts.
[02:25:36.857 --> 02:25:37.498]  I'm just an idiot.
[02:25:37.858 --> 02:25:39.438]  Some conspiracy theorist told me.
[02:25:39.518 --> 02:25:40.679]  I don't have any facts.
[02:25:40.959 --> 02:25:41.919]  I don't have any proof.
[02:25:42.959 --> 02:25:43.980]  It's good for me.
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:45.401]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:46.102 --> 02:25:46.944]  Okay, well, there you go.
[02:25:46.964 --> 02:25:49.407]  Study finds high fructose corn syrup contains mercury.
[02:25:49.667 --> 02:25:51.470]  This is from last week, folks.
[02:25:52.592 --> 02:25:57.719]  I mean, just Google bad effects of corn syrup, corn syrup diabetes, corn syrup liver.
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:00.122]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:26:02.881 --> 02:26:05.082]  Let's continue with a review of propaganda.
[02:26:05.122 --> 02:26:10.306]  Folks on radio hear the audio, which is most of the propaganda, but those watching prisonplanet.tv are getting the visual.
[02:26:11.026 --> 02:26:15.629]  Let's analyze the HULU commercial with Alec Baldwin.
[02:26:17.650 --> 02:26:26.295]  We can do this because this is all fair use, ladies and gentlemen, as we sit here and analyze this piece of propaganda.
[02:26:26.616 --> 02:26:27.376]  Here we go.
[02:26:27.396 --> 02:26:28.877]  Hello Earth.
[02:26:29.697 --> 02:26:31.719]  I'm Alec Baldwin, TV star.
[02:26:33.789 --> 02:26:35.430]  You know they say TV will rot your brain?
[02:26:37.312 --> 02:26:38.093]  That's absurd.
[02:26:38.673 --> 02:26:43.717]  TV only softens the brain, like a ripe banana, to take it all the way.
[02:26:44.298 --> 02:26:45.238]  We've created Hulu.
[02:26:45.959 --> 02:26:55.847]  Hulu beams TV directly to your portable computing devices, giving you more of the cerebral gelatinizing shows you want, anytime, anywhere, for free.
[02:26:55.867 --> 02:26:59.390]  I only hang out because I want your love!
[02:26:59.470 --> 02:27:01.211]  Get away!
[02:27:01.251 --> 02:27:02.072]  Mushy mush.
[02:27:02.993 --> 02:27:04.874]  And the best part is there's nothing you can do to stop it.
[02:27:05.194 --> 02:27:07.556]  I mean, what are you gonna do, turn off your TV and your computer?
[02:27:11.838 --> 02:27:17.342]  Once your brain's reduced to a cottage chase like mush, we'll scoop them out with a melon baller and gobble them right on up.
[02:27:18.102 --> 02:27:18.362]  Oops.
[02:27:19.183 --> 02:27:20.083]  I think I'm drooling a little.
[02:27:21.965 --> 02:27:22.645]  Because we're aliens.
[02:27:23.526 --> 02:27:24.446]  And that's how we roll.
[02:27:24.706 --> 02:27:26.748]  Hulu, an evil plot to destroy the world.
[02:27:26.988 --> 02:27:27.308]  Enjoy.
[02:27:29.861 --> 02:27:31.442]  This is hardcore evil.
[02:27:32.142 --> 02:27:36.764]  And I'm sure that, uh... Alec Baldwin is very useful to the New World Order.
[02:27:37.164 --> 02:27:38.985]  Hans Blix, come on in, buddy.
[02:27:40.566 --> 02:27:43.407]  Um... It's fun, it's cute.
[02:27:44.007 --> 02:27:45.888]  Okay, uh, do it right now.
[02:27:46.128 --> 02:27:49.230]  I'm gonna let the guys do this, and I want it on screen as you Google.
[02:27:50.030 --> 02:27:51.811]  On screen, please, for them.
[02:27:52.571 --> 02:27:54.172]  Put your Google on screen for them.
[02:27:54.192 --> 02:27:56.993]  We're gonna go back to three doors down brainwashing in a moment.
[02:27:57.833 --> 02:27:59.054]  And I want you to Google
[02:28:01.837 --> 02:28:03.383]  We did this on KLBJ about six months ago.
[02:28:03.403 --> 02:28:06.835]  It took you guys a few tries, but let me think of the exact key words to find it.
[02:28:07.930 --> 02:28:10.451]  Television viewing Alzheimer's.
[02:28:11.432 --> 02:28:13.253]  Television viewing Alzheimer's.
[02:28:13.893 --> 02:28:23.999]  Tens of thousands of peer-reviewed top studies that if you watch more than an hour of television a day, you get massive increases in Alzheimer's.
[02:28:24.139 --> 02:28:26.780]  It literally makes your brain rot.
[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:27.681]  You know why?
[02:28:27.761 --> 02:28:31.743]  Because after age 30, you lose millions of brain cells a day, but
[02:28:32.483 --> 02:28:35.224]  You have extra brain space to create new neural pathways when you're learning.
[02:28:35.485 --> 02:28:43.929]  When you're watching television, it puts you, because of the flicker rate and other reasons, into a lower state of mind, a sleep stage.
[02:28:44.929 --> 02:28:47.231]  And then the brain starts desiccating quicker.
[02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:50.572]  You start losing more of the operable brain cells.
[02:28:51.453 --> 02:28:53.194]  TV viewing and Alzheimer's.
[02:28:55.080 --> 02:28:59.182]  Access my library, BBC News, TV links to Alzheimer's.
[02:28:59.922 --> 02:29:01.203]  On screen, please.
[02:29:01.643 --> 02:29:05.245]  Oh, and now there's 996,000 hits there for you.
[02:29:05.845 --> 02:29:06.805]  Please punch it back up.
[02:29:07.045 --> 02:29:07.926]  But it's funny!
[02:29:07.986 --> 02:29:09.286]  Ha ha, Alec Baldwin!
[02:29:09.486 --> 02:29:10.167]  Ha ha ha!
[02:29:10.407 --> 02:29:18.690]  So now when you tell somebody that TV literally destroys your cognitive abilities and literally causes you to become retarded,
[02:29:20.535 --> 02:29:22.379]  It won't matter, because... Oh!
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:25.765]  Alec Baldwin and the little alien tentacle!
[02:29:27.113 --> 02:29:29.074]  We're aliens and that's how we roll.
[02:29:29.094 --> 02:29:35.216]  Oh yes, it's a guild of psychopathic humans, who do believe they're another species, who are operating this system.
[02:29:35.236 --> 02:29:37.017]  But oh, there she is, having her brain sucked.
[02:29:37.577 --> 02:29:42.238]  Watching too much television and doing too little physical activity could link to Alzheimer's disease, according to U.S.
[02:29:42.298 --> 02:29:42.839]  researchers.
[02:29:43.539 --> 02:29:50.341]  And it goes on to talk about massive increases in people getting Alzheimer's in a direct correlation with watching more television.
[02:29:50.922 --> 02:29:54.283]  Oh, but Alec, bartering is very useful to them.
[02:29:55.023 --> 02:29:55.924]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:56.444 --> 02:29:58.045]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:58.345 --> 02:30:00.006]  Transmission continues.
[02:30:01.647 --> 02:30:02.547]  We're on the march.
[02:30:03.048 --> 02:30:04.629]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:05.569 --> 02:30:08.331]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:12.673 --> 02:30:13.774]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[02:30:18.925 --> 02:30:19.445]  We're good to go!
[02:30:48.078 --> 02:30:51.561]  is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[02:30:52.041 --> 02:30:54.102]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[02:30:55.463 --> 02:30:58.686]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[02:30:59.046 --> 02:31:01.208]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:01.508 --> 02:31:03.990]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:11.661 --> 02:31:18.044]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:31:18.404 --> 02:31:20.385]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:31:21.045 --> 02:31:22.086]  But who is the enemy?
[02:31:22.606 --> 02:31:23.106]  Bin Laden.
[02:31:23.406 --> 02:31:24.327]  This is his ammo.
[02:31:24.367 --> 02:31:25.727]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:31:25.767 --> 02:31:27.448]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:31:27.768 --> 02:31:34.511]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:31:34.911 --> 02:31:35.351]  Some U.S.
[02:31:35.391 --> 02:31:41.074]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:31:41.734 --> 02:31:45.257]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:31:45.617 --> 02:31:55.483]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:31:55.703 --> 02:31:56.464]  Fabled enemies.

[02:32:04.709 --> 02:32:08.052]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:32:11.454 --> 02:32:14.175]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[02:32:14.375 --> 02:32:15.495]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[02:32:15.515 --> 02:32:19.696]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[02:32:19.716 --> 02:32:22.377]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function?
[02:32:22.577 --> 02:32:24.278]  Or are you simply treating the symptoms?

[02:32:58.317 --> 02:32:59.217]  That's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com.
[02:33:04.821 --> 02:33:05.201]  I think so.
[02:33:34.332 --> 02:33:34.752]  All right.
[02:33:36.933 --> 02:33:39.454]  I saw a computer company ad about a year ago.
[02:33:39.494 --> 02:33:40.615]  I don't watch much TV.
[02:33:40.675 --> 02:33:42.416]  It's all propaganda now.
[02:33:43.696 --> 02:33:50.099]  And it showed a guy with a laser pointer at a computer screen showing people some new high technology system.
[02:33:50.759 --> 02:33:57.102]  And the crowd was chimpanzees, not listening, throwing spitballs, throwing paper airplanes, you know, smoking cigarettes.
[02:33:57.963 --> 02:34:00.504]  And it was all about how you're a bunch of idiots and we're above you.
[02:34:01.044 --> 02:34:02.064]  And it was the same thing here.
[02:34:02.525 --> 02:34:05.446]  It's like you won't be able to resist our product.
[02:34:05.466 --> 02:34:10.488]  You're going to watch, you know, our entertainment TV shows now on your computer.
[02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:12.769]  And we have you and it's rotting your brain.
[02:34:13.249 --> 02:34:19.792]  So now when you talk about that, they're going to say you got that from the Super Bowl Alec Baldwin ad that's running everywhere.
[02:34:21.573 --> 02:34:26.615]  And you're not, it familiarizes you, it acclimates you, it makes you comfortable.
[02:34:26.655 --> 02:34:29.316]  This is all about institutionalizing you, domesticating you.
[02:34:30.359 --> 02:34:31.460]  And it's just everything.
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:33.601]  Today, I've always talked about analyzing commercials.
[02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:34.741]  Well, now we've got the TV show.
[02:34:35.261 --> 02:34:36.862]  Now we're in here, you know, simulcasting.
[02:34:36.902 --> 02:34:39.343]  I can show everyone this and folks can hear the audio.
[02:34:41.244 --> 02:34:49.688]  But that's why we need more funds so I can hire writers so they can sit here and watch what I cover on air and then go do an article about it and post the material.
[02:34:51.249 --> 02:34:54.010]  Three writers isn't enough, but as it is, we're not hiring writers.
[02:34:54.030 --> 02:34:54.591]  We don't have the money.
[02:34:55.526 --> 02:35:06.591]  We're hiring an extra IT person, some more sales folks because they pay for themselves, another radio producer, another video person, another video editor, and we're totally maxed there.
[02:35:07.692 --> 02:35:11.553]  Please buy the books and videos on the site because we're not funded by the New World Order.
[02:35:11.573 --> 02:35:14.535]  We're not funded by the corn syrup makers.
[02:35:17.396 --> 02:35:17.696]  What's up?
[02:35:17.736 --> 02:35:19.057]  You're trying to talk to me because I can't hear you.
[02:35:20.353 --> 02:35:26.895]  Yeah, we're going to go ahead and go to another clip now, the Three Doors Down video.
[02:35:28.016 --> 02:35:37.279]  It looks like what I saw in the movie theater last night was a different variant of this, so there must be multiple variants of Three Doors Down, and this particular one
[02:35:38.553 --> 02:35:43.778]  is equating being in the National Guard with being in the militia in the Revolutionary War.
[02:35:43.838 --> 02:35:45.380]  People know that's bedrock America.
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:47.242]  There's a hunger for revolution.
[02:35:47.462 --> 02:35:48.903]  So they're saying, yes, we're the revolution.
[02:35:49.264 --> 02:35:50.105]  Join the military.
[02:35:51.066 --> 02:35:53.448]  They don't tell you, though, the National Guard now has been totally federalized.
[02:35:53.468 --> 02:35:58.613]  You'll go overseas immediately, then be trained in kicking down doors and gun confiscation, and then come back here to the U.S.
[02:35:58.994 --> 02:35:59.654]  under NORTHCOM.
[02:36:00.675 --> 02:36:01.276]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:36:07.088 --> 02:36:08.850]  Soldier, yeah baby!
[02:36:15.376 --> 02:36:19.220]  Join the military, we got vaccines full of mercury.
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:20.942]  We got corn syrup too.
[02:36:21.122 --> 02:36:23.404]  We're on the boundaries of your city's lights.
[02:36:23.624 --> 02:36:25.446]  We've got depleted uranium.
[02:36:25.466 --> 02:36:28.309]  Family members waiting for your cries.
[02:36:29.096 --> 02:36:30.217]  Rewind it, rewind it.
[02:36:30.717 --> 02:36:32.497]  Look, look, stop, stop, stop.
[02:36:32.838 --> 02:36:37.780]  Again, whenever you see a drug commercial for Prozac, it's clouds and you're sad, everything's unhappy.
[02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:45.003]  Then it cuts to a beautiful park with that magic golden hour about an hour before sunset and they're playing football in the park and...
[02:36:45.703 --> 02:36:48.906]  Outside the boundaries of your cities.
[02:36:49.286 --> 02:36:50.628]  You know, here's the psychology.
[02:36:50.668 --> 02:36:53.890]  You're in the garden of Eden.
[02:36:54.391 --> 02:36:56.893]  You're protecting your woman.
[02:36:57.113 --> 02:36:59.375]  But outside it's dangerous.
[02:36:59.656 --> 02:37:02.218]  Who protects this Eden?
[02:37:02.538 --> 02:37:03.459]  Our troops do.
[02:37:03.759 --> 02:37:04.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:09.785]  But in reality, it's the troops that are bringing in the New World Order, the enforcement, to destroy our Eden.
[02:37:11.158 --> 02:37:12.459]  It's this basic human instinct.
[02:37:12.859 --> 02:37:19.662]  Your little village and the enemy tribe 20 miles away that raids you a couple times a year and kills your people and hauls your women off.
[02:37:19.942 --> 02:37:23.484]  And you're sitting there in the cave or in the hut looking at your woman, looking at your three children.
[02:37:23.684 --> 02:37:26.185]  You're out hunting all day and fishing, trying to bring them food in.
[02:37:26.545 --> 02:37:28.006]  You're always, you know, you've got your weapon there.
[02:37:28.026 --> 02:37:32.628]  You don't want to fight because the other tribe's bigger and they're stronger, but you've got to protect your family.
[02:37:32.688 --> 02:37:33.788]  It's a base instinct.
[02:37:34.068 --> 02:37:35.249]  So you've got to protect your women.
[02:37:35.649 --> 02:37:37.971]  I'm gonna be a citizen soldier.
[02:37:38.331 --> 02:37:42.174]  When in reality, the military is owned by the foreign banks that are destroying your family.
[02:37:43.695 --> 02:37:45.957]  Now play this devilish propaganda for folks.
[02:37:48.199 --> 02:37:51.201]  Oh yeah, oh my God.
[02:37:51.361 --> 02:37:53.323]  We put out propaganda for the government.
[02:37:53.983 --> 02:37:57.586]  Oh, playing football, protect America.
[02:37:59.281 --> 02:38:00.863]  Alright, here, pause again.
[02:38:18.723 --> 02:38:22.846]  See, you didn't bring this on yourself, but soldiers are stuck outside the city lights.
[02:38:22.906 --> 02:38:24.067]  They're stuck battling.
[02:38:24.327 --> 02:38:27.849]  You need to join the military to save Americans that are outgunned and outnumbered.
[02:38:28.650 --> 02:38:31.131]  Fighting hard to kill 1.3 million Iraqis.
[02:38:31.191 --> 02:38:33.193]  Fighting hard to ship in cocaine and heroin.
[02:38:33.453 --> 02:38:35.134]  Fighting hard to bring in that opium.
[02:38:35.374 --> 02:38:36.875]  Fighting hard to launder that money.
[02:38:37.095 --> 02:38:39.357]  Fighting hard to torture people in secret camps.
[02:38:39.777 --> 02:38:41.999]  Fighting hard to train to take over the U.S.
[02:38:42.499 --> 02:38:44.260]  filled with illegal aliens and felons.
[02:38:45.141 --> 02:38:47.222]  Criminals, they're fighting hard for you.
[02:38:47.322 --> 02:38:48.503]  You're not against America.
[02:38:48.683 --> 02:38:51.045]  I'm gonna call you right now.
[02:38:51.085 --> 02:38:55.248]  I'm a hundred percent a soldier.
[02:38:55.268 --> 02:38:55.868]  Keep going.
[02:38:55.908 --> 02:38:58.870]  See, get paused.
[02:38:59.250 --> 02:38:59.871]  See, get paused.
[02:39:00.271 --> 02:39:06.676]  See, just like Obama says we're gonna have National Compulsory Service, but the first thing they push is helping people in floods and hurricanes and soup kitchens.
[02:39:06.696 --> 02:39:07.476]  Well, who's against that?
[02:39:07.876 --> 02:39:09.518]  But the real mission's taking your guns.
[02:39:09.558 --> 02:39:12.239]  The bills are introduced to do it, and they've announced troops are in the U.S.
[02:39:12.259 --> 02:39:13.540]  to be used against us for that.
[02:39:14.641 --> 02:39:15.742]  And they did it in New Orleans.
[02:39:16.562 --> 02:39:17.143]  And Illinois.
[02:39:19.130 --> 02:39:21.274]  So this is a different version than I saw last night.
[02:39:25.341 --> 02:39:27.064]  There must be a whole bunch of these things out there.
[02:39:28.026 --> 02:39:29.729]  And what was the one you were... Well, keep going.
[02:39:34.847 --> 02:39:39.592]  See, now they're associating it with everything's an image, a meme, a archetype.
[02:39:40.373 --> 02:39:43.316]  Now you see one of the revolutionary Swamp Foxes.
[02:39:43.336 --> 02:39:44.677]  He's running from cannon fire.
[02:39:44.697 --> 02:39:45.438]  He's a militia.
[02:39:45.638 --> 02:39:50.423]  When in truth, the feds are demonizing militias, trying to outlaw them, trying to disarm the American people.
[02:39:51.044 --> 02:39:52.325]  But they show you that image.
[02:39:52.825 --> 02:39:54.666]  Oh, we're the guys that are with the Founding Fathers.
[02:39:54.886 --> 02:39:58.589]  When I have FEMA on video teaching the Founding Fathers we're terrorists, then America's bad.
[02:39:58.929 --> 02:39:59.769]  Oh, it's in road to tyranny.
[02:39:59.789 --> 02:40:00.970]  You want me to play that clip?
[02:40:01.310 --> 02:40:02.391]  You're out there doubting me?
[02:40:03.192 --> 02:40:05.893]  Oh, just like I told you Alzheimer's is being caused by watching TV?
[02:40:05.913 --> 02:40:07.734]  And all the mercury in your food?
[02:40:07.754 --> 02:40:11.777]  Would you like me to show FEMA saying the Founding Fathers were bad?
[02:40:13.098 --> 02:40:14.899]  We have time, we will do that, but it's in road to tyranny.
[02:40:16.272 --> 02:40:17.213]  So look at that.
[02:40:17.233 --> 02:40:19.054]  That's a minute man.
[02:40:19.714 --> 02:40:20.674]  That's been taboo.
[02:40:20.714 --> 02:40:22.916]  That's been bad in the media, but now it's okay.
[02:40:23.256 --> 02:40:24.376]  You can be a minute man.
[02:40:24.997 --> 02:40:26.097]  You can be a minute man.
[02:40:26.157 --> 02:40:30.000]  You can help take over Iraq and make sure all the kids get their shots so they can't have babies.
[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:32.421]  But they'll tell you it was so they don't get smallpox.
[02:40:33.021 --> 02:40:34.242]  Let's go ahead and go back to the clip.
[02:40:40.189 --> 02:40:46.094]  We're good.
[02:40:51.151 --> 02:40:53.691]  Alright, hit pause.
[02:40:54.271 --> 02:40:54.731]  Hit pause.
[02:40:55.251 --> 02:40:59.412]  Notice how the guy running looks like or maybe the same guy playing football.
[02:40:59.832 --> 02:41:04.713]  We all know we're connected instinctively to our ancestors and that we are connected to those that come after us.
[02:41:04.753 --> 02:41:06.513]  We truly live forever through our progeny.
[02:41:07.094 --> 02:41:14.555]  So they're actually reaching into base human programming, not just with our heritage, but directly with it being the same person.
[02:41:16.112 --> 02:41:20.636]  Saying he fought before, be part of that great heritage.
[02:41:22.077 --> 02:41:24.419]  This is hardcore psych warfare.
[02:41:24.739 --> 02:41:26.941]  Continue with the Pentagon attack on the American people.
[02:41:26.961 --> 02:41:27.281]  Go ahead.
[02:41:32.745 --> 02:41:35.247]  I fired the shot that started the nation.
[02:41:36.788 --> 02:41:39.250]  I fired the shot that started the nation.
[02:41:40.748 --> 02:41:52.860]  They've introduced the gun control bills to literally ban all semi-autos, to make everybody be licensed in America, with psychological federal testing, where the feds can say you're on a terror or crime list with no judge, no jury, no arrest, and ban you owning any guns.
[02:41:53.121 --> 02:41:55.083]  It's all introduced, we covered it earlier in the show.
[02:41:57.125 --> 02:42:02.228]  They've introduced bills to build FEMA camps, they've already built the camps, but now they're saying they're going to merge local police with them.
[02:42:02.528 --> 02:42:07.251]  They're destroying what these guys went to war because the British were confiscating their guns!
[02:42:07.612 --> 02:42:12.014]  Now the very same New World Order is here doing it, claiming they're our ancestors!
[02:42:12.234 --> 02:42:13.515]  This is high treason!
[02:42:13.895 --> 02:42:15.697]  Our military isn't ours anymore!
[02:42:16.137 --> 02:42:18.438]  We are the Minutemen!
[02:42:18.618 --> 02:42:22.621]  We are the Sons of Liberty that fight the New World Order, not the people in the military!
[02:42:24.534 --> 02:42:28.136]  There are good people in the military who know what's going on and are upset.
[02:42:28.176 --> 02:42:29.236]  In fact, the majority of them.
[02:42:29.256 --> 02:42:32.257]  But they're being replaced with illegal aliens and crime syndicate operatives.
[02:42:32.277 --> 02:42:39.700]  And the biggest recruiting stations are in Mexico City, Manila, Philippines, and of course in the major cities in the Eastern Bloc, former Eastern Bloc, like Ukraine and Czech Republic.
[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:40.741]  Check into it!
[02:42:41.841 --> 02:42:45.003]  They're signing deals to bring foreign troops into America, not just in the Combined Force.
[02:42:45.703 --> 02:42:45.883]  Now!
[02:42:47.250 --> 02:42:47.910]  Remember that.
[02:42:48.531 --> 02:42:50.052]  Remember who you work for.
[02:42:50.312 --> 02:42:59.477]  You work for the bankers that have hijacked America and now have to use the military to suppress the people so we don't get justice while your banker bosses take over the pension funds.
[02:43:00.457 --> 02:43:01.598]  Back it up about 20 seconds.
[02:43:01.618 --> 02:43:02.579]  I want to play this for folks.
[02:43:03.279 --> 02:43:04.560]  Oh, you started a nation.
[02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:05.900]  That's good.
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:06.320]  Hit play.
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:07.401]  You started a nation.
[02:43:08.061 --> 02:43:10.042]  You know, because you're in the New World Order military.
[02:43:10.622 --> 02:43:14.403]  No, you are the ones killing the country and killing other sovereign countries.
[02:43:14.683 --> 02:43:15.864]  You're country killers.
[02:43:16.084 --> 02:43:17.264]  You're freedom killers.
[02:43:17.905 --> 02:43:22.546]  You're training to take our guns and I've got video ten years ago of it and now it's openly announced.
[02:43:23.007 --> 02:43:23.747]  Play the video!
[02:43:26.878 --> 02:43:33.421]  All right, pause.
[02:43:51.350 --> 02:43:56.994]  The Minutemen are fighting the Redcoats and then it cuts to Apache helicopters blowing up cities.
[02:43:57.755 --> 02:44:01.759]  No, the Redcoats were the Apache helicopters blowing up cities.
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:09.625]  The ragtag people fighting them are the equivalent of 1776ers.
[02:44:10.426 --> 02:44:11.387]  Let's get that straight, too.
[02:44:11.847 --> 02:44:17.032]  We were the underdogs, the Iraqis are the underdogs, not the big giant behemoth blowing the hell out of everything in its way.
[02:44:18.527 --> 02:44:21.508]  This is disgusting, sickening, filthy propaganda.
[02:44:21.708 --> 02:44:27.731]  And everything the military works for now is destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution that all the other veterans before him fought for.
[02:44:27.991 --> 02:44:31.613]  This is a disgrace and is an abomination to the Republic!
[02:44:32.473 --> 02:44:35.174]  I rebuke this accursed piece of propaganda!
[02:44:35.895 --> 02:44:37.575]  Don't let them continue with the evil!
[02:44:38.636 --> 02:44:47.960]  When there are people crying in the streets When they're starving for a meal to eat
[02:44:48.723 --> 02:44:49.283]  Stop right there!
[02:44:50.464 --> 02:44:53.005]  Why are the women starving for a meal to eat in all these countries?
[02:44:53.065 --> 02:45:00.388]  Because the globalists came in and blew up their water structures, their power plants, their roads, their bridges, their infrastructure, and put siege on them for decades.
[02:45:01.641 --> 02:45:04.464]  Women starving for something to eat!
[02:45:05.004 --> 02:45:06.025]  All this bull!
[02:45:06.606 --> 02:45:14.094]  I mean, you know, the Nazis had propaganda posters where it showed a Nazi soldier, you know, in Russia or Poland, handing someone a loaf of bread.
[02:45:14.854 --> 02:45:21.301]  There's literally pictures of them handing a woman a loaf, there's one like this below them, and they're going, Heil Hitler below it, handing the woman a piece of bread.
[02:45:25.683 --> 02:45:29.485]  And by the way, I know when I just did that the PSYOPs are going to go put that and say I was Howling Hitler.
[02:45:29.745 --> 02:45:32.906]  But then people are going to find out you lied about it and find out you're working for the government.
[02:45:33.126 --> 02:45:34.467]  And then they'll know how credible we are.
[02:45:34.627 --> 02:45:36.408]  So go ahead and run your PSYOP on that one too.
[02:45:36.948 --> 02:45:38.349]  You lying scum!
[02:45:38.389 --> 02:45:39.289]  You will be defeated!
[02:45:40.209 --> 02:45:42.010]  The Republic is going to kick your ass!
[02:45:42.030 --> 02:45:42.730]  Get that straight!
[02:45:43.531 --> 02:45:45.292]  The real 1776ers!
[02:45:45.512 --> 02:45:46.692]  Not this counterfeit!
[02:45:46.932 --> 02:45:48.093]  Now go back to the video!
[02:45:49.173 --> 02:45:52.594]  They simply need a place to make their beds.
[02:45:52.854 --> 02:45:57.255]  Right here underneath my wing, you can rest your head.
[02:45:58.095 --> 02:46:07.438]  And on that day, when you need your brothers and sisters to care, I'll be right here.
[02:46:08.258 --> 02:46:11.899]  Send us in soldiers, holding the line.
[02:46:12.788 --> 02:46:13.669]  Alright, stop right there.
[02:46:13.689 --> 02:46:14.710]  Another huge lie.
[02:46:14.730 --> 02:46:21.876]  It's saying, while the military is off feeding and helping people, actually blowing their countries up and then, it's like shooting somebody in the head and giving them a band-aid.
[02:46:23.517 --> 02:46:26.980]  While the troops, see they're sucking in good men and women who mean well to join the military.
[02:46:27.981 --> 02:46:31.544]  But they're lying to them saying, you'll be a citizen soldier, you'll be right here at home.
[02:46:33.306 --> 02:46:34.507]  So this is people that don't want to fight.
[02:46:34.927 --> 02:46:37.549]  They're saying, you join the National Guard, you support the real troops,
[02:46:38.530 --> 02:46:39.251]  Here in the U.S.
[02:46:39.931 --> 02:46:42.453]  They've been deploying over 80% of the National Guard.
[02:46:43.674 --> 02:46:48.377]  They're getting rid of the National Guard and completely federalizing it for combat duty, domestically and internationally.
[02:46:48.717 --> 02:46:56.843]  So this video ought to show National Guard confiscating people's guns, going into people's houses, taking down their American flags, stealing their property.
[02:46:56.863 --> 02:47:00.766]  It ought to show the troops at a bank helping the bankers steal all the pension funds.
[02:47:01.447 --> 02:47:02.788]  Then this would be an accurate video.
[02:47:04.226 --> 02:47:05.947]  And again, we're not against the troops here.
[02:47:05.987 --> 02:47:08.569]  We're against you being propagandized and brainwashed.
[02:47:09.049 --> 02:47:10.110]  So, so, continue.
[02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:11.751]  It's just every five seconds is pure lies.
[02:47:11.771 --> 02:47:12.212]  Go back to it.
[02:47:15.214 --> 02:47:16.415]  Alright, hit pause right there.
[02:47:16.655 --> 02:47:18.696]  Oh, I stormed the beaches of Normandy.
[02:47:18.736 --> 02:47:20.518]  See, they're going back through all the heritage.
[02:47:21.879 --> 02:47:22.859]  Meanwhile, it was big U.S.
[02:47:22.919 --> 02:47:24.761]  and British banks that actually installed Hitler.
[02:47:24.981 --> 02:47:30.445]  He was Time Magazine Man of the Year twice and worshipped in the United States and told to go ahead and invade those countries.
[02:47:30.745 --> 02:47:32.046]  Then they set him up and brought him down.
[02:47:33.117 --> 02:47:34.418]  They create these evil demons.
[02:47:35.099 --> 02:47:37.200]  Just like Saddam Hussein and some have been lying to all of them.
[02:47:38.681 --> 02:47:45.487]  So they're equating joining the National Guard with all this when the National Guard is openly going to be used against the American people in gun confiscation.
[02:47:45.527 --> 02:47:45.887]  Continue.
[02:47:46.427 --> 02:47:57.236]  Ken Thomas, he loves his wife.
[02:47:57.296 --> 02:47:58.717]  They just tug on every heart string.
[02:47:59.097 --> 02:48:00.458]  He's kissing his ring.
[02:48:00.838 --> 02:48:01.279]  Family.
[02:48:01.319 --> 02:48:02.840]  So you're watching this, it makes you think of your wife.
[02:48:05.382 --> 02:48:06.764]  So that's for the old people watching.
[02:48:07.625 --> 02:48:17.497]  This is all unified propaganda to sell the public on war, to sell the public on tyranny, to get young people to join the National Guard thinking they won't be shipped overseas, they'll be backing up the citizen soldiers.
[02:48:17.937 --> 02:48:18.298]  Continue.
[02:48:37.657 --> 02:48:41.719]  Okay, so they mix war in with soldiers helping people here in the U.S.
[02:48:41.819 --> 02:48:42.599]  More propaganda.
[02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:47.242]  In truth, the National Guard would be there confiscating the firearms, as they do all over the country, and there's a disaster now.
[02:48:48.062 --> 02:48:52.624]  So, again, just like Barack Obama says, well, I'm for compulsory soup kitchens.
[02:48:53.265 --> 02:48:55.666]  But really behind that is domestic police brigades.
[02:48:56.346 --> 02:48:58.968]  So see, this is all just propaganda they put in here.
[02:48:59.048 --> 02:48:59.408]  Continue.
[02:49:04.813 --> 02:49:07.134]  I always place the mission first.
[02:49:07.515 --> 02:49:08.555]  Then they say pray.
[02:49:08.615 --> 02:49:14.378]  You know, the governments are destroying religion when they don't like it, or using it to control people when they can.
[02:49:14.859 --> 02:49:16.139]  With the clergy response teams.
[02:49:16.399 --> 02:49:25.184]  Right out of Red Dawn, the local preachers trained to tell American citizens to turn their guns in and go to FEMA camps.
[02:49:25.704 --> 02:49:26.945]  I will never accept defeat.
[02:49:27.405 --> 02:49:30.087]  Defeat to them is leaving an occupied country.
[02:49:31.778 --> 02:49:34.700]  And now Obama's basically saying the Tribs will just stay in Iraq forever.
[02:49:35.060 --> 02:49:38.262]  They're going to increase the Tribs in other areas of the world, like Afghanistan.
[02:49:38.762 --> 02:49:41.404]  And the message is, I never show a white flag.
[02:49:41.424 --> 02:49:42.504]  We never retreat.
[02:49:42.544 --> 02:49:43.185]  We never leave.
[02:49:43.785 --> 02:49:44.806]  They said we'd be there six months.
[02:49:44.826 --> 02:49:45.446]  They promised we would.
[02:49:45.826 --> 02:49:47.847]  But the documents said they were going to be there forever.
[02:49:49.028 --> 02:49:49.849]  A hundred year war.
[02:49:50.549 --> 02:49:53.511]  So, again, just every five seconds, pure propaganda.
[02:49:53.531 --> 02:49:53.851]  Continue.
[02:49:55.346 --> 02:49:56.247]  We're good to go.
[02:50:06.525 --> 02:50:09.986]  Okay, the strongest among you may not wear a crown.
[02:50:10.006 --> 02:50:12.087]  You have the Redcoats coming to confiscate guns.
[02:50:12.367 --> 02:50:13.107]  That's how it started.
[02:50:13.647 --> 02:50:15.328]  You have the militia shooting them.
[02:50:16.048 --> 02:50:17.328]  And now they cut to U.S.
[02:50:17.389 --> 02:50:20.930]  military doing a breach entry, blowing open a door for gun confiscation.
[02:50:21.210 --> 02:50:22.990]  The Redcoats are coming to take the guns.
[02:50:23.931 --> 02:50:26.511]  They show you the image of the Minutemen firing back.
[02:50:27.012 --> 02:50:28.832]  Then it cuts to U.S.
[02:50:28.872 --> 02:50:31.313]  military doing an entry for gun confiscation.
[02:50:32.733 --> 02:50:33.914]  Back it up a few seconds here.
[02:50:34.892 --> 02:50:35.612]  They've all been trained.
[02:50:35.632 --> 02:50:37.893]  They're coming back to be cops and domestic military.
[02:50:38.033 --> 02:50:39.953]  They've been kicking down doors thousands of times.
[02:50:40.253 --> 02:50:40.913]  They're trained in it.
[02:50:40.933 --> 02:50:45.734]  They brought back the main brigade, who are the top folks in this, to the United States for this.
[02:50:47.014 --> 02:50:49.455]  This play out, we're going to come back and finish it up.
[02:50:49.715 --> 02:50:52.275]  I meant to get to all these calls, but I started analyzing propaganda.
[02:50:53.076 --> 02:50:55.556]  It's just, you know, fructose corn syrup's good for you.
[02:50:55.856 --> 02:50:57.996]  A early study finds high fructose corn syrup contains mercury.
[02:50:58.317 --> 02:51:00.397]  Half of brands tested had high levels of mercury.
[02:51:01.596 --> 02:51:06.560]  But on the ads they go, there's no proof there's anything wrong, corn syrup, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:51:06.961 --> 02:51:07.982]  You know, everything's fine.
[02:51:12.341 --> 02:51:16.164]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.

[02:54:35.317 --> 02:54:37.338]  Let's go ahead and go back to the propaganda piece.
[02:54:38.238 --> 02:54:40.259]  So he's fighting gun confiscators right here.
[02:54:40.279 --> 02:54:40.999]  They don't tell you that.
[02:54:41.019 --> 02:54:42.960]  Next it cuts to gun confiscators.
[02:54:50.362 --> 02:55:00.891]  Oh yeah?
[02:55:00.971 --> 02:55:09.118]  The feds left.
[02:55:11.932 --> 02:55:12.913]  More than 10,000 U.S.
[02:55:13.233 --> 02:55:14.173]  troops for the Soviets.
[02:55:14.213 --> 02:55:15.994]  They grabbed out of German camps, didn't even care about them.
[02:55:16.014 --> 02:55:17.215]  They'll leave you behind in a minute.
[02:55:17.455 --> 02:55:19.036]  They'll inject you with deadly vaccines.
[02:55:19.276 --> 02:55:25.220]  They're also now taking the promise of free health care for life from World War II and Korean War vets.
[02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:28.522]  And they're taking the Second Amendment right away from vets right now.
[02:55:28.862 --> 02:55:32.564]  That's what the new White House Chief of Staff is basically pushing.
[02:55:33.905 --> 02:55:34.745]  Join the Republic.
[02:55:34.825 --> 02:55:35.926]  Fight for the Republic now.
[02:55:36.006 --> 02:55:37.287]  Fight the New World Order, folks.
[02:55:37.827 --> 02:55:40.309]  Join the real fight for liberty, not this phony counterfeit.
[02:55:40.329 --> 02:55:40.829]  Go back to it.
[02:55:45.522 --> 02:55:48.444]  I stepped forward when the towers fell, when the globalists blew them up.
[02:55:49.005 --> 02:55:51.907]  And then they breathed deadly dust and they won't give them treatment, even though it's admitted.
[02:55:52.107 --> 02:55:52.667]  Okay, continue.
[02:56:08.078 --> 02:56:12.521]  We are free because they are brave.
[02:56:13.162 --> 02:56:15.804]  That might have been the truth in the past, but this isn't our military anymore.
[02:56:17.044 --> 02:56:21.768]  And the sooner we start realizing that and facing up to that, the sooner we can turn this Republic back.
[02:56:21.788 --> 02:56:28.553]  The people running our country are openly in the Wall Street Journal announcing that they're getting rid of the dollar, bringing in an Amaro, and creating a North American Union.
[02:56:28.953 --> 02:56:30.314]  Everything we told you is now admitted.
[02:56:30.614 --> 02:56:31.575]  It's all happening.
[02:56:31.755 --> 02:56:32.776]  They're making their move!
[02:56:33.536 --> 02:56:34.938]  I love this country more than anything.
[02:56:34.958 --> 02:56:36.699]  This is where my family's been for hundreds of years.
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:41.004]  I had family on the Mayflower, family in the Revolutionary War, family right here in Texas.
[02:56:41.044 --> 02:56:42.445]  We raised Colonel Travis's son.
[02:56:42.826 --> 02:56:44.908]  My family's been here since, you know, 1829.
[02:56:45.369 --> 02:56:47.371]  Folks, I love Texas.
[02:56:47.471 --> 02:56:48.292]  I love the Republic.
[02:56:48.812 --> 02:56:51.574]  And I'm telling you right now, this is the New World Order period.
[02:56:51.735 --> 02:56:54.056]  Stop being conned by this slick propaganda.
[02:56:54.237 --> 02:56:56.378]  We just showed you all those other commercials that are full of lies.
[02:56:56.679 --> 02:56:58.200]  We're going to start doing that more and more here.
[02:56:58.220 --> 02:57:01.563]  If there's a commercial you want us to check out, send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:01.583 --> 02:57:07.307]  We're going to start having a featured commercial every day on the show, where I'll spend ten minutes analyzing it.
[02:57:08.408 --> 02:57:12.192]  If you want to support us, too, as well, folks, we're in the fight for the Republic Night.
[02:57:12.392 --> 02:57:12.932]  No one else.
[02:57:14.346 --> 02:57:18.430]  The materials at InfoWars.com, the books, the videos, it's all about getting the word out.
[02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:22.493]  So please go there and purchase the books and films so we can continue to fight for the Republic.
[02:57:23.514 --> 02:57:24.475]  And join us in the fight.
[02:57:24.495 --> 02:57:25.776]  Keep spreading the word about the show.
[02:57:27.137 --> 02:57:30.761]  Support congressmen and others that are fighting the New World Order, Ron Paul and others.
[02:57:33.015 --> 02:57:43.877]  Coming up in the rebroadcast, we had a great interview with Mike Rivero and a lot of calls and a lot of key news I covered on new gun control at the very start of the show, where they're going to put you on citizen watch list and won't be able to own guns.
[02:57:44.477 --> 02:57:48.838]  So that is, without a judge or jury or anything, that is coming up in the rebroadcast.
[02:57:48.898 --> 02:57:50.278]  It starts in T-minus two minutes.
[02:57:50.878 --> 02:57:52.239]  OnePlaceInfoWars.com.
[02:57:52.279 --> 02:57:56.099]  Well, some stations re-air the show, so OnePlaceOnlineInfoWars.com.
[02:57:56.119 --> 02:57:59.680]  Before I do that though, I want to thank our final sponsor of the day, Survival
[02:58:01.181 --> 02:58:05.905]  is key, ladies and gentlemen, and survivalistseeds.com are great folks.
[02:58:06.525 --> 02:58:10.708]  And so I just hope people will check out their site and what they're doing.
[02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:15.472]  And again, everything we talk about is documented.
[02:58:15.512 --> 02:58:16.953]  Everything we talk about is on record.
[02:58:16.993 --> 02:58:18.394]  We understand the enemy program.
[02:58:18.414 --> 02:58:19.495]  We understand their propaganda.
[02:58:19.515 --> 02:58:20.255]  This is what we do.
[02:58:20.295 --> 02:58:21.917]  This is what we study.
[02:58:23.117 --> 02:58:26.238]  And we are counting on you out there to carry the ball.
[02:58:26.938 --> 02:58:27.919]  We're all in this together.
[02:58:28.419 --> 02:58:29.699]  This is the true patriotism.
[02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:31.060]  This is not the counterfeit.
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:32.240]  They were just pushing there.
[02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:39.983]  This is a huge lie just because on the face of it, they tell you you're going to stay at home as a National Guardsman.
[02:58:40.243 --> 02:58:40.703]  That's not true.
[02:58:40.723 --> 02:58:41.604]  They're going to send you overseas.
[02:58:42.044 --> 02:58:42.264]  All right.
[02:58:42.304 --> 02:58:43.825]  God bless you all, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:43.865 --> 02:58:44.985]  Don't fight for the Empire.
[02:58:45.325 --> 02:58:46.466]  Fight for the Republic.
[02:58:47.406 --> 02:58:48.106]  God bless you all.
[02:58:48.126 --> 02:58:49.847]  We'll be right back in one minute at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:53.134 --> 02:58:55.316]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:55.756 --> 02:58:59.119]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:59:01.301 --> 02:59:01.881]  Hello, friends.
[02:59:01.941 --> 02:59:02.882]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:59:03.002 --> 02:59:07.606]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:59:07.726 --> 02:59:10.488]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:10.709 --> 02:59:13.571]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:13.751 --> 02:59:18.455]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:18.675 --> 02:59:19.616]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:19.816 --> 02:59:22.758]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:23.058 --> 02:59:29.942]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:30.082 --> 02:59:33.164]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:33.324 --> 02:59:33.584]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:33.604 --> 02:59:34.865]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.

[02:59:44.733 --> 02:59:48.316]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:48.336 --> 02:59:49.737]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:49.777 --> 02:59:50.438]  Take action today.
[02:59:50.478 --> 02:59:52.460]  The first step is getting storable food.
