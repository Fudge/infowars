[00:00:01.553 --> 00:00:02.133]  Initiate!
[00:00:03.473 --> 00:00:05.394]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:05.854 --> 00:00:08.735]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:15.877]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:17.597]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:19.417]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:20.878]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:22.538]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:26.879]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:29.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:31.469]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.110]  We are live now to the third hour of the fourth hour coming up as well.
[00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.071]  We're not just doing the radio show right now.
[00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:51.373]  In the last two hours every day we simulcast live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the full studio with the documents, the video clips, putting the articles up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:00:52.193 --> 00:00:56.094]  Finishing up with Glenn Spencer of American Border Patrol.
[00:00:57.254 --> 00:01:14.559]  Who is one of the most prominent and tireless, focused people exposing the crisis with our third world nation that is bordering our south that is now falling apart in on itself with just carnage and murder and mayhem and now mass kidnappings
[00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.224]  There have been a lot of cases where drug smugglers will take 40-plus people, kidnap them out of Arizona or Texas.
[00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:22.586]  The police have to raid it and get killed.
[00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:24.107]  I mean, it's getting bad.
[00:01:24.808 --> 00:01:27.590]  And now the State Department's admitting there's kidnappings all over the U.S.
[00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.931]  of Americans down to Mexico.
[00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:31.374]  They're not just kidnapping Americans when they go to Mexico.
[00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:33.055]  The police are sucking money out of the family.
[00:01:33.816 --> 00:01:36.518]  In a minute or two, we're going to go to Sheriff Richard Mack for the next 30 minutes.
[00:01:36.898 --> 00:01:39.521]  Then we have a state representative joining us with all these states.
[00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:39.781]  It's now 10.
[00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:47.806]  And as you heard Jack McClam earlier, 20 more moving to declare sovereignty against the Feds and all their globalist orders.
[00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:51.248]  But finishing up with that and your website, Glenn Spencer.
[00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:03.555]  Well yeah, we were talking about the fact that we have major crimes in our cities that are being committed by these drug gangs.
[00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:06.632]  Here is the AP report.
[00:02:06.712 --> 00:02:06.932]  U.S.
[00:02:06.972 --> 00:02:15.935]  authorities are reporting a spike in killings, kidnappings, and home invasions connected to Mexico's murderous cartels right in our cities.
[00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:24.858]  Now, we've got 40% of the population of the prisons of California are in one way or another linked to illegal immigration.
[00:02:25.338 --> 00:02:30.319]  Now, they're going to let, I mean, now they're saying you've got to let go, 40% of the population.
[00:02:32.236 --> 00:02:42.599]  You have illegal aliens convicted of serious crimes during this unrest in California.
[00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.780]  They're going to release 60,000 of these people into the community?
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.442]  Which will then cause huge crime rates to even spike more, then the feds bring in more federalization of police and funding to control the general population.
[00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.780]  So they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.962]  Len Spencer, I want to get you back on the next few weeks for part two of this interview.
[00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:03.823]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:04.784]  Fire off the websites.
[00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:06.905]  AmericanPatrol.com.
[00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:08.145]  Alright.
[00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:09.406]  AmericanPatrol.com.
[00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.788]  I got 151 people online right now.
[00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.009]  Alright.
[00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.310]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.070]  Take care, my friend.
[00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.610]  Thanks a lot.
[00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:18.311]  Alright, folks.
[00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:24.463]  The next 30 minutes were joined by Sheriff Richard Mack.
[00:03:25.224 --> 00:03:30.489]  For those that don't know who he is, former sheriff in Graham County, Arizona and long-time prosecutor for freedom and individual rights.
[00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.454]  Right now, it is vital that they restore the Constitution and the supreme law of the land.
[00:03:34.474 --> 00:03:36.436]  The greatest threat we face today is not terrorists.
[00:03:36.756 --> 00:03:39.959]  It is our own federal government of America is conquered or ruined.
[00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.661]  It will be from within, not a foreign enemy.
[00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:43.122]  That's his quote.
[00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:47.026]  And you can go to his website, SheriffMac.com.
[00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:52.690]  He, of course, brought a case to the Supreme Court for the Second Amendment on 10th Amendment grounds, states' rights, and won.
[00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.792]  And we are very, very thankful to have him on with his perspective.
[00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:59.455]  As everything we talked about now has come true, world government upon us.
[00:03:59.756 --> 00:04:02.338]  We're about to break, but I want to introduce you now, Sheriff Mac.
[00:04:02.378 --> 00:04:03.298]  Great to have you on with us.
[00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.980]  Well, Alex, it's so good to be back with you.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.465]  It's been a while, and I've been following what you've been doing, and I really thank you for having me back on with you.
[00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:12.846]  It's a great pleasure.
[00:04:13.134 --> 00:04:14.535]  Well, I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:19.678]  Every major newspaper is announcing world government's the answer to the economic crisis.
[00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:23.440]  World government run by the very same central banks that are now engineering the crisis.
[00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:25.481]  Well, it is.
[00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:36.728]  And just, I mean, just like you're talking about the immigration problem, the global governance problem, where can we go?
[00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.088]  Where can we go for help?
[00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:39.469]  Washington, D.C.?
[00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.310]  Your senator?
[00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.090]  Your congressman?
[00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.351]  All that's a joke.
[00:04:45.458 --> 00:05:04.373]  Richard Max, our guest, will be back after this short three-minute break and break down the state of the union according to this great patriot and his advice to police and military out there who are being asked more and more to violate real rights of the Constitution and aid the foreign banksters in their takeover of our once great republic.
[00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:04.794]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:16.509]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:21.856]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:27.222]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:05:27.503 --> 00:05:29.285]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[00:05:29.505 --> 00:05:33.067]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:05:33.387 --> 00:05:39.390]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.152]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:05:43.412 --> 00:05:47.955]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:49.015]  Do your part.
[00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:51.537]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[00:05:51.897 --> 00:05:58.020]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink

[00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:12.947]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:06:13.287 --> 00:06:14.547]  Loose change, final cut.
[00:06:14.847 --> 00:06:16.828]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:16.988 --> 00:06:18.589]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:18.888 --> 00:06:20.130]  The late, great USA.
[00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.772]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:29.002]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:13.477]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:07:13.537 --> 00:07:19.162]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:23.326]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:25.908]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:31.834]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures

[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.080]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.881]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:21.342]  You want answers?
[00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:22.962]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:23.062 --> 00:08:27.465]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.865 --> 00:08:30.206]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:31.931]  Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:37.597]  We are back live with Sheriff Richard Mack.
[00:08:37.677 --> 00:08:49.949]  We had more lawmen like him in this country, more defenders of liberty, more servants, and through servants is how great work is done, through heroes, than we would be in the situation we're in today.
[00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:53.633]  Sheriff Richard Mack, in the time we've got, I want to have you back up soon for a full hour.
[00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.433]  You know, going back to what I first said, I want you to speak to this.
[00:08:58.593 --> 00:09:02.114]  I mean, they're in the Time Magazine saying we're all socialists now.
[00:09:02.154 --> 00:09:03.094]  They're in Newsweek saying it.
[00:09:03.534 --> 00:09:05.815]  Time Magazine has the headline, New World Order.
[00:09:05.855 --> 00:09:10.997]  They say a new global bank to run the United States, to control the entire world that we pay taxes to.
[00:09:11.357 --> 00:09:14.458]  This is what we always said the international bankers were planning because their own documents said it.
[00:09:15.058 --> 00:09:17.599]  Why are they now coming right out in the open with this?
[00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:24.301]  Why are they pushing this, and what does this mean to you that they're finally not lying about it anymore?
[00:09:24.341 --> 00:09:28.703]  You know, the FBI training manuals say you're a terrorist if you talk about a New World Order, and it doesn't exist.
[00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:31.263]  Now they're admitting it exists, but saying it's good.
[00:09:32.524 --> 00:09:38.426]  Well, I've written about... Time Magazine has talked about the New World Order quite a bit.
[00:09:38.646 --> 00:09:41.367]  I did an article about, I think,
[00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:48.385]  It was an issue of 1995 where Time Magazine said, had an article, who should keep the keys?
[00:09:49.466 --> 00:09:56.751]  And it talked about Henry Kissinger saying that we need to compromise American idealism in order to fit into today's global society.
[00:09:57.312 --> 00:09:59.573]  This isn't that new and you and I both know that.
[00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:03.796]  But I think now is the time for them to make their play.
[00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:07.739]  They're obviously not hiding it anymore.
[00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:08.920]  They've got
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:20.350]  New World Order boys in there that have been pushing this, you know, ever since, well, the first George Bush, obviously, was pushing for this.
[00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.431]  He talked about the New World Order all the time.
[00:10:22.932 --> 00:10:25.194]  Bill Clinton talked about the New World Order all the time.
[00:10:27.116 --> 00:10:28.117]  George Jr.
[00:10:28.657 --> 00:10:34.783]  didn't say the words nearly as much as his dad did, but he was certainly pushing for this.
[00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:38.835]  They're giving all our money to the banksters.
[00:10:38.915 --> 00:10:40.356]  The banksters own America.
[00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:42.598]  The banks own our currency.
[00:10:43.719 --> 00:10:52.326]  And that's why people like you and I have said all along that you better have gold and silver and food storage and you better be able to protect yourselves and your family.
[00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:56.410]  And so along with your food storage you need guns and ammo.
[00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:07.335]  These things, we've been preaching since we've been on the air and since we've been involved in the Freedom Movement, myself, for the last 15 years, maybe a little bit longer.
[00:11:09.477 --> 00:11:18.065]  Why there's being so blatant about it right now, I don't know, but the monster is knocking on the door and we better be ready for it.
[00:11:18.973 --> 00:11:21.434]  There's nobody protecting us in Washington, D.C.
[00:11:22.054 --> 00:11:27.536]  Ron Paul would probably be the only one, but he's basically ineffective because he's all by himself.
[00:11:28.736 --> 00:11:39.980]  You know, just like I said before the break, if you think you're going to call your congressman, I get all these emails all the time, call your congressman, call your senator, and ask him not to do this bill or whatever.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.980]  Those are all jokes, Alex.
[00:11:42.341 --> 00:11:46.842]  I do not waste my time trying to call my congressman or senator anymore.
[00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:49.002]  Those guys are bought and paid for.
[00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.303]  They're going to do what they're going to do.
[00:11:50.383 --> 00:11:51.705]  They do not care about you.
[00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:53.526]  They do not care about their constituents.
[00:11:54.247 --> 00:11:57.509]  And there is one person who I believe can stop this New World Order.
[00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.272]  His name is your county sheriff.
[00:12:02.673 --> 00:12:07.077]  And that's why I've written a new book, The County Sheriff America's Last Hope.
[00:12:08.338 --> 00:12:11.521]  It details the documentation.
[00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:14.163]  There is no question that your sheriff
[00:12:14.682 --> 00:12:17.586]  Has the responsibility to protect you from tyranny.
[00:12:32.783 --> 00:12:37.488]  Literally, he can, you know, call up a posse, the local draft, it's totally constitutional.
[00:12:37.948 --> 00:12:46.416]  Instead, they've tried to shut down the sheriff, demonize it, or run feds and New World Order people for the position, so they've been attacking it from every angle.
[00:12:46.456 --> 00:12:49.459]  Weakening it, getting rid of it, making it appointed, not elected.
[00:12:49.479 --> 00:12:53.342]  I think the best way to start here is... You're right.
[00:12:53.382 --> 00:12:54.203]  They've already stopped.
[00:12:54.283 --> 00:12:56.205]  They've already done away with the sheriff in Connecticut.
[00:12:57.191 --> 00:13:02.456]  And you were talking about the immigration problem, not the immigration problem, but the illegal immigration problem.
[00:13:03.457 --> 00:13:12.865]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has endorsed my book, by the way, he's on the back of the book, he believes in all of this about the autonomy of the sheriff.
[00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:14.607]  Look what he has done.
[00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:24.055]  He has been, I guess, the only sheriff in this country to round up illegals and arrest them and take them and put them in jail.
[00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:30.366]  And he's having the feds come and get him as soon as they can and say, look, I'm doing your job here.
[00:13:30.446 --> 00:13:31.847]  Come and get them and send them back.
[00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:36.169]  This is an amazing example of your sheriff.
[00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:40.370]  Have you noticed that nobody can get in his way?
[00:13:41.091 --> 00:13:52.055]  He even had the city of Mesa, where he was doing some raids there, and he actually went into the city of Mesa building and arrested some illegal aliens in the city complex.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:01.923]  And the chief of police got real mad and was spouting off on the news about Sheriff Arpaio should be coordinating such an effort with him.
[00:14:02.664 --> 00:14:06.225]  And then they interview Arpaio, of course, and you know what he said.
[00:14:06.965 --> 00:14:11.247]  The last time I looked, Mesa is within the jurisdiction of Maricopa County.
[00:14:11.627 --> 00:14:13.488]  He says, I don't have to ask anybody's permission.
[00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:15.649]  And that's the point I make in the book.
[00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:18.250]  Your sheriff is not a bureaucrat.
[00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.231]  He does not answer to anyone except the people.
[00:14:22.043 --> 00:14:28.252]  And he's bound by oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and therefore he can protect you from the IRS.
[00:14:28.652 --> 00:14:34.480]  He can protect you and your money, your property, your welfare, your children.
[00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:38.105]  He is the only answer left.
[00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:42.187]  The county sheriff, America's last hope.
[00:14:43.168 --> 00:14:48.672]  I think at the county level, but there's also juries, grand juries, that form of voting for the people is another hope.
[00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:55.037]  And we now have ten states and twenty others now saying they may sign on to declare sovereignty and end the bills.
[00:14:55.417 --> 00:15:04.564]  I've been reading the last few days on air, we've had some state reps on, it states we will not have martial law, we will not have gun confiscation, we will not have forced compulsory service.
[00:15:04.984 --> 00:15:06.906]  And they list what the feds are doing and so
[00:15:07.486 --> 00:15:13.271]  The state is the answer, and enshrined in that, the smallest unit of that, is the sheriff.
[00:15:14.311 --> 00:15:20.496]  And you're right, I've seen cases all over the country where they're trying to come repossess people's homes, and the sheriff's saying no.
[00:15:21.617 --> 00:15:30.464]  That's why they tried to move to block the sheriff, and basically federalize the states, because originally, and how our country's set up, it is the state that is the true unit of power.
[00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:35.368]  It is, and the county even more powerful than that, I do believe.
[00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:41.465]  In the book you'll see the documentation from my lawsuit that you mentioned when you introduced me.
[00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:57.257]  The lawsuit is key to all of this because it establishes the constitutional premise for the sheriff to have this power and it's backed up by a recent Supreme Court ruling which came out in June of 1997.
[00:15:57.497 --> 00:16:05.543]  This has not been rescinded, it's law, and Justice Scalia details quite clearly
[00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:13.515]  That the federal government has no power over the county or the county sheriff or the state employees.
[00:16:13.915 --> 00:16:17.637]  Instead though, under Obama, they're trying to federalize everything.
[00:16:17.657 --> 00:16:25.360]  They're building FEMA camps where the local sheriff offices out of it with the military, with the police, and with clergy response teams.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.160]  Can you speak to that?
[00:16:27.281 --> 00:16:27.881]  Well, yes.
[00:16:29.002 --> 00:16:30.142]  You know, those are happening.
[00:16:31.002 --> 00:16:31.823]  Or it appears.
[00:16:32.203 --> 00:16:33.964]  I haven't seen any here in Arizona yet.
[00:16:34.972 --> 00:16:36.533]  It doesn't matter where they're going up.
[00:16:36.613 --> 00:16:39.934]  If they're going up one place, they're going to be going up in others.
[00:16:40.994 --> 00:17:04.342]  I've maintained, even when I was sheriff, and I maintain even now, that the sheriff can tell FEMA to stay out of his county, we can make our own preparations, and the typical example of this is the failure of the federal government, especially during Hurricane Katrina, to really help people, and people have their hands out and expect the federal government to come take care of you.
[00:17:04.969 --> 00:17:08.212]  Don't expect it, don't count on it, and don't even want it.
[00:17:08.592 --> 00:17:11.914]  You need to make your own preparations at the county level.
[00:17:13.335 --> 00:17:14.676]  Look what they did also at Katrina.
[00:17:14.716 --> 00:17:17.018]  They started taking everybody's guns away from them.
[00:17:17.338 --> 00:17:28.207]  That's what I was going to say is, finally the parish sheriff, not a county, a parish there, had to go stop FEMA from cutting the police communication lines because they wanted total federal control.
[00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:39.002]  Of course, and they're going to, and if we continue to allow it, if we have sheriffs who aren't aware of their duty, then this is going to continue to happen.
[00:17:39.042 --> 00:17:51.706]  I mean, you can look at the problems that happen when sheriffs are relinquished at Ruby Ridge, at Waco, at New Hampshire with the Elaine, what was her last name?
[00:17:51.766 --> 00:17:52.446]  Edna Lane Rome.
[00:17:52.846 --> 00:17:54.547]  Yeah, exactly, the Brown family.
[00:17:55.194 --> 00:18:03.897]  I mean, every place where the sheriff, and I think these were good sheriffs and good people there, they just are ignorant of the power and authority they have.
[00:18:04.517 --> 00:18:12.040]  The federal government has no jurisdiction in your county to be doing these things unless you, as the sheriff, allow it.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:19.983]  And yes, you can go along, but to do so means you're throwing your constituents to the dogs.
[00:18:20.763 --> 00:18:23.984]  And this needs to be turned around, and I do believe that this book
[00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.330]  Well, here's a...
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:19:02.280]  And if we could get three or four hundred of them on board, just get ten percent on board, the rest of it will snowball, or you could move to where one of them who actually is a constitutional sheriff.
[00:19:03.306 --> 00:19:07.547]  And this idea is spreading, thanks to you and others, rediscovering liberty in our true system of government.
[00:19:07.947 --> 00:19:13.268]  A microcosm is studying the Western expansion, the robber barons, the oil companies, the coal companies, the railroads.
[00:19:13.829 --> 00:19:21.871]  They would come in and buy off a sheriff and use him to let the Pinkerton and others go in and slaughter people and kick them off their land.
[00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:26.452]  But in more cases than not, it was the people's sheriff that would fight off the bankers.
[00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:28.452]  So we've gone through this before.
[00:19:29.032 --> 00:19:29.593]  Yes, we have.
[00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:42.000]  I really feel that the time is ripe because of the hopelessness that people felt during especially this last campaign.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:51.984]  The presidential election I think left so many people with a bad taste in their mouth of hopelessness and right now I'm giving a message that there is hope and it is your county sheriff.
[00:19:53.803 --> 00:19:55.204]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:55.685 --> 00:20:02.571]  Final segment with Sheriff Richard Mack, straight ahead after this quick break and his new book.
[00:20:02.591 --> 00:20:04.373]  We'll talk about that as well.
[00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:18.977]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:20:19.157 --> 00:20:23.540]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.223]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:20:28.383 --> 00:20:29.784]  It's a documented fact.
[00:20:30.184 --> 00:20:37.267]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:20:37.428 --> 00:20:49.273]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:20:49.513 --> 00:20:53.195]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:56.196]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:20:56.937 --> 00:21:00.599]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:04.140]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.681]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:10.043]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:25.298]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:25.658 --> 00:21:31.245]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[00:21:31.573 --> 00:21:33.514]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:38.576]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:38.917 --> 00:21:43.619]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:47.981]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:49.502]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:49.562 --> 00:21:53.644]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:54.084 --> 00:21:55.444]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:58.966 --> 00:22:01.529]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.475]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:06.796 --> 00:22:07.636]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:08.778 --> 00:22:16.647]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:17.008 --> 00:22:18.710]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:22:19.645 --> 00:22:20.685]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:21.185 --> 00:22:21.686]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:21.986 --> 00:22:22.966]  This is his M.O.
[00:22:22.986 --> 00:22:24.326]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:22:24.366 --> 00:22:25.967]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:22:26.347 --> 00:22:33.089]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:22:33.489 --> 00:22:33.929]  Some U.S.
[00:22:33.969 --> 00:22:39.611]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:22:40.331 --> 00:22:43.812]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:43.832 --> 00:22:46.813]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:23:10.103 --> 00:23:18.508]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:23:18.828 --> 00:23:24.492]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[00:23:24.812 --> 00:23:31.336]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:23:31.897 --> 00:23:35.180]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.542]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[00:23:37.742 --> 00:23:44.108]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[00:23:44.348 --> 00:23:47.672]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[00:24:03.945 --> 00:24:08.968]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[00:24:13.331 --> 00:24:16.053]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[00:24:17.694 --> 00:24:19.095]  Said the Joker to the thief.
[00:24:19.436 --> 00:24:20.857]  There's too much confusion.
[00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:23.599]  I can't get no relief.
[00:24:25.305 --> 00:24:29.528]  Outside in the cold distance, a wildcat did growl.
[00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:32.449]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.552]  Said the joker to the thief.
[00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:39.814]  There's too much confusion.
[00:24:42.335 --> 00:24:45.357]  I can't get no relief.
[00:24:45.437 --> 00:24:49.480]  Fit the standard to drink my wine.
[00:25:03.386 --> 00:25:06.208]  Sheriff Richard Mack is our guest with us till 40 after this.
[00:25:06.228 --> 00:25:07.568]  We're getting into financial news.
[00:25:07.609 --> 00:25:12.331]  We have a state rep coming on, this time from Missouri, fighting the New World Order.
[00:25:13.291 --> 00:25:20.115]  Look, anytime good people disengage from government, tyranny comes in and fills the vacuum.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.181]  99% of countries and nations have been tyrannical.
[00:25:26.142 --> 00:25:27.922]  And that's really the bottom line.
[00:25:28.023 --> 00:25:29.683]  You will have everything you've got stolen.
[00:25:29.703 --> 00:25:34.525]  You really think you can just give the bankers your pension funds and your 401Ks and they wouldn't run a scam to steal it?
[00:25:35.245 --> 00:25:37.366]  That's what this police state's about, is total control.
[00:25:37.706 --> 00:25:47.930]  Sheriff Richard Mack, I think it's important in the time we have left with you, for you to reach out to the police, not just the Sheriff's Department, and explain to them how they've been manipulated, how they're being turned to the dark side.
[00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.511]  Perhaps you should briefly talk about your awakening.
[00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.530]  Well, it is.
[00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.751]  And this book is directed towards everyone.
[00:25:55.351 --> 00:25:59.733]  And my first book, the prequel to this one, is The Proper Role of Law Enforcement.
[00:25:59.793 --> 00:26:05.734]  And it is intended for all police officers so they will become peace officers in this country.
[00:26:06.515 --> 00:26:20.799]  And yes, quite frankly, the police departments across this country, whether it's sheriff's offices or police departments, have been brought into this mode of and been inculcated, if not brainwashed, into believing that all laws must be enforced.
[00:26:21.582 --> 00:26:26.586]  And that no matter what, it comes down from the pike from Washington, D.C.
[00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:28.567]  or from the state capitol must be enforced.
[00:26:28.627 --> 00:26:42.216]  But that really, and the book talks about that very issue of that lack of principle behind that, because that's actually, as Thomas Jefferson called it, laws were nothing more but tools of the tyrant.
[00:26:43.117 --> 00:26:44.778]  And that's what laws have become today.
[00:26:44.878 --> 00:26:47.420]  And so all this photo radar crap
[00:26:48.187 --> 00:26:55.429]  And the multi-billion dollar industry of wholesale distribution of traffic tickets, especially radar tickets.
[00:26:56.989 --> 00:26:57.869]  You can go on and on.
[00:26:57.909 --> 00:27:04.170]  The drug war, the drug war is something else I have preached against for the last 10 years.
[00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:08.111]  I'm one of the speakers for law enforcement against prohibition.
[00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:12.152]  Prohibition does not work unless you're promoting
[00:27:12.911 --> 00:27:14.953]  A police state and big brother government.
[00:27:15.173 --> 00:27:19.716]  And more drugs because then there's so much profit and in every case of prohibition it increases.
[00:27:19.756 --> 00:27:20.196]  Of course.
[00:27:21.116 --> 00:27:21.517]  Of course.
[00:27:21.677 --> 00:27:22.497]  I mean, let's be real.
[00:27:22.938 --> 00:27:23.998]  Prohibition doesn't work.
[00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:34.145]  Abraham Lincoln said prohibition is an insane law and an insane practice and makes crimes out of things that were never crimes at all.
[00:27:35.325 --> 00:27:36.706]  Prohibition isn't anything new.
[00:27:38.481 --> 00:27:39.762]  It goes way, way back.
[00:27:39.822 --> 00:27:45.425]  In fact, back during the Scottish Rebellion against the King of England during Braveheart.
[00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:58.251]  You can even see in that movie of Braveheart where the King of England outlawed bagpipe music because it promoted patriotism and feelings of wanting to be free.
[00:27:58.972 --> 00:28:01.133]  And so, you know, Prohibition is nothing new.
[00:28:01.313 --> 00:28:05.435]  And now, isn't it insane that we have hemp
[00:28:06.587 --> 00:28:15.990]  Illegal when we could use hemp to restore the economy of this country and make oil and fuel and all sorts of things that we could get from this hemp plant.
[00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.711]  And let's be clear, almost all the hemp varieties don't have THC.
[00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.512]  No, they don't.
[00:28:21.592 --> 00:28:24.493]  It's better than cotton, better for rope, but it's banned.
[00:28:25.033 --> 00:28:26.113]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:26.213 --> 00:28:28.674]  And I don't even care if they have THC in it.
[00:28:28.734 --> 00:28:29.214]  Who cares?
[00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:30.194]  But it doesn't.
[00:28:30.755 --> 00:28:33.355]  And hemp has been used in our country way back.
[00:28:33.415 --> 00:28:35.096]  The Declaration of Independence was written on it.
[00:28:35.954 --> 00:28:36.975]  So is the Constitution.
[00:28:37.896 --> 00:28:45.801]  But it's absurd what our government does and then turns right around and lies to us and says stuff like, but there's no earmarks in this bill.
[00:28:46.842 --> 00:28:58.671]  You know, it's amazing that people, we have so many Kool-Aid drinkers in this country and I'm afraid that the police have been part of the Kool-Aid drinkers and we've got to stand up and recognize our oath of office.
[00:28:59.452 --> 00:29:04.075]  The book points out and starts with this principle that James Madison said that
[00:29:04.748 --> 00:29:13.311]  Uh, we, the states, as we, you and I were talking earlier, states and counties are supposed to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority.
[00:29:13.971 --> 00:29:15.171]  Well, that's what this is about.
[00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:31.936]  And if we could depend on the 600 some odd thousand peace officers in this country to keep their oath of office, to uphold and defend the constitution, instead of being red coats for the central government and sometimes for the state.
[00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:34.535]  We could get our country back.
[00:29:34.956 --> 00:29:38.018]  The people of this country could have their freedom back tomorrow.
[00:29:38.538 --> 00:29:39.779]  Sheriff Richard Mack, stay there.
[00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:41.220]  Final segment with you coming up.
[00:29:42.121 --> 00:29:46.785]  And if police and military people don't like hearing this from Sheriff Richard Mack, you don't like the United States.
[00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:49.146]  Because this is what this country was founded on.
[00:29:49.447 --> 00:29:57.272]  It was set up to stop a powerful central government because they always are bad, they always go bad, and they always hurt the people big time.
[00:29:57.573 --> 00:29:59.034]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:30:01.195 --> 00:30:04.182]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:05.124 --> 00:30:07.810]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.155 --> 00:30:14.458]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[00:30:14.719 --> 00:30:17.061]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?
[00:30:17.181 --> 00:30:17.842]  Guaranteed!

[00:30:33.117 --> 00:30:33.557]  We're good to go.
[00:30:56.957 --> 00:31:00.519]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:01.479]  And we knew what to do.
[00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.940]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.963]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:31:27.307 --> 00:31:35.890]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:31:36.211 --> 00:31:43.013]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:31:43.313 --> 00:31:46.375]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:31:46.475 --> 00:31:51.717]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:31:52.257 --> 00:31:54.798]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:31:55.316 --> 00:32:01.177]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:32:01.357 --> 00:32:03.898]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:32:04.278 --> 00:32:09.319]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.159]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:13.800]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.320]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.501]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:32:21.917 --> 00:32:24.758]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:32:25.099 --> 00:32:41.007]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:32:41.567 --> 00:32:43.568]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:32:43.588 --> 00:32:44.869]  I use one every day.
[00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:47.730]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.551]  We're good.
[00:33:23.762 --> 00:33:28.288]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to start pre-sales of the Obama Deception today.
[00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:34.675]  I'll be done with the film in a few weeks and it'll be mass-produced and ship out on
[00:33:36.218 --> 00:33:39.861]  March 15th, and we'll also be at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[00:33:40.382 --> 00:33:42.123]  We're getting an amazing response.
[00:33:42.183 --> 00:33:43.384]  People are freaking out wanting it.
[00:33:43.945 --> 00:33:47.208]  This doesn't attack him for the Kenya stuff, or is he really a proper U.S.
[00:33:47.248 --> 00:33:48.068]  citizen and all that.
[00:33:48.449 --> 00:33:50.951]  We're not saying that that's not an issue, just we're not getting into that.
[00:33:50.971 --> 00:34:01.260]  We're getting into who he's appointing, what he's doing, his history, the gun control, the open borders, the FEMA camps, and how he's controlled by the very Wall Street group that engineered the implosion by design.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.362]  This film is dynamic.
[00:34:03.942 --> 00:34:05.043]  This film is dynamic.
[00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:07.305]  I was up here again until midnight last night.
[00:34:07.365 --> 00:34:11.048]  I'm working on this tirelessly with my team.
[00:34:11.088 --> 00:34:14.330]  TheObamaDeception.net is the website.
[00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.252]  And it's now up on the shopping cart.
[00:34:16.292 --> 00:34:18.513]  We have it linked to it on the main page of InfoWars.com.
[00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:24.318]  PrisonPlanet.com yet, but why should you pre-order?
[00:34:24.779 --> 00:34:31.345]  Well, when you pre-order, the orders come in in a stack, and the first person to order is the first person to have it shipped to them by UPS.
[00:34:31.905 --> 00:34:32.706]  And it's vital.
[00:34:32.746 --> 00:34:34.568]  That's why I usually make a film in six months.
[00:34:34.608 --> 00:34:42.935]  I make this one in like three, because I have been racing and racing and racing, but it's just as much quality or more than my other films.
[00:34:42.955 --> 00:34:44.096]  We're getting better and better at this.
[00:34:46.638 --> 00:34:47.779]  And it's just an unbelievable film.
[00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:49.260]  It's obviously dangerous for us to do this.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.541]  They come after everybody that fights them.
[00:34:50.982 --> 00:34:51.942]  But we're telling it like it is.
[00:34:52.003 --> 00:34:53.204]  He's a front man for the New World Order.
[00:34:53.244 --> 00:34:57.027]  So, the Obama Deception is on sale right now at Infowars.com.
[00:34:57.387 --> 00:34:59.849]  We've got to get the toll-free line ready to take orders.
[00:35:00.249 --> 00:35:01.771]  In fact, let's call them and get that set up.
[00:35:02.231 --> 00:35:03.132]  The Obama Deception, 1995.
[00:35:04.032 --> 00:35:07.836]  I want you to make unlimited copies of this and give it out to everybody you know.
[00:35:08.276 --> 00:35:10.198]  Going back to Sheriff Richard Mack.
[00:35:14.267 --> 00:35:19.329]  There was a story in the San Antonio Express News two days ago, and I see these every couple days and don't even cover them.
[00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:20.689]  I don't like bashing police.
[00:35:20.789 --> 00:35:25.271]  I know in psychology it actually makes them get more into a gang mentality group.
[00:35:26.711 --> 00:35:33.474]  I know that most beat cops are good people, good men and women, but I know that these boss hog towns in a lot of these big cities are criminal.
[00:35:33.554 --> 00:35:34.134]  I've seen it.
[00:35:35.484 --> 00:35:44.192]  And they just talk about all over Texas, I mean, just county after county, they just pull you over and take your watch, take your wallet, under acid forfeiture, no drugs, no nothing found illegal.
[00:35:44.412 --> 00:35:45.453]  They rob old ladies.
[00:35:45.833 --> 00:35:46.654]  It's all in the news.
[00:35:47.295 --> 00:35:52.119]  I mean, it's not just bad cops or bad corrupt systems or violating the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[00:35:52.759 --> 00:35:55.502]  We're seeing what happens in Mexico and most other nations.
[00:35:55.562 --> 00:35:57.744]  They are just going completely criminal.
[00:35:58.204 --> 00:36:01.867]  And they're now recruiting more and more criminals into the police force, the military.
[00:36:02.728 --> 00:36:05.790]  We've got to turn this around now, or the whole society will collapse like Mexico.
[00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.172]  Well, we do, and we all have a responsibility with this.
[00:36:11.052 --> 00:36:12.373]  We're off track in our country.
[00:36:12.513 --> 00:36:13.914]  We've forgotten our roots.
[00:36:14.934 --> 00:36:17.135]  We have gotten off our constitutional basics.
[00:36:17.956 --> 00:36:21.357]  We don't teach fundamentals in the police academies.
[00:36:22.718 --> 00:36:24.659]  They do hire people that should not be in there.
[00:36:25.079 --> 00:36:27.960]  And I'm grateful, too, just as you said, that these are
[00:36:29.488 --> 00:36:32.290]  The exceptions and not the norm, but it's happening too much.
[00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.313]  And we need people to be vigilant.
[00:36:36.453 --> 00:36:39.495]  And you know, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
[00:36:39.555 --> 00:36:42.537]  And we've got to get a handle on all of this.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:50.462]  You know, in my first book, The Proper Role of Law Enforcement, it addresses that issue and it addresses how I was converted to the Constitution.
[00:36:51.002 --> 00:36:53.284]  And I wasn't born a constitutional cop.
[00:36:54.411 --> 00:37:02.252]  You know, it came from looking at my oath of office one day that I swore to uphold independent constitution, but I had never read it, so I started reading it.
[00:37:02.793 --> 00:37:13.014]  And I believe that when these fundamental documents come to life for police officers and peace officers and sheriffs in this country, that they will have the same conversion.
[00:37:13.674 --> 00:37:23.356]  I believe, just as you said, that most of these men and women are good people, but they have to be given proper and good information or they're never going to change.
[00:37:24.142 --> 00:37:38.526]  I believe this change is possible, and in my book it addresses that, like I told you, it documents a large portion of my case that was endorsed by the Supreme Court, and it's a landmark decision, and it needs to be used.
[00:37:39.527 --> 00:37:48.810]  And Madison, James Madison is quoted against, again talking about states standing up, and counties standing up against the federal government.
[00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:52.991]  And it says, hence, a double security arises to the rights of the people.
[00:37:53.772 --> 00:37:58.614]  The different governments will control each other at the same time that each will be controlled by itself.
[00:37:59.114 --> 00:38:01.415]  That's a quote from Madison, which is in the decision.
[00:38:01.435 --> 00:38:01.515]  Yeah.
[00:38:01.875 --> 00:38:04.816]  Each, each, each binding down the others to the Constitution.
[00:38:04.836 --> 00:38:05.116]  Correct.
[00:38:05.536 --> 00:38:05.896]  Correct.
[00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:09.038]  And so now this is the only place in the book that it does this.
[00:38:09.438 --> 00:38:18.661]  So it says to the reader, so who is charged with safeguarding the people from the federal government when it refuses to control itself?
[00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:20.722]  And then in parentheses, it says,
[00:38:21.385 --> 00:38:24.028]  Please write the answer in the space provided.
[00:38:24.088 --> 00:38:28.133]  And there's an empty slide right there for the reader to put that in there.
[00:38:28.193 --> 00:38:32.498]  And you want your sheriff to realize the answer.
[00:38:32.598 --> 00:38:33.879]  And there could be several answers.
[00:38:33.959 --> 00:38:35.041]  It could be the sheriff.
[00:38:35.081 --> 00:38:36.222]  It could be you.
[00:38:36.302 --> 00:38:37.724]  The answer is we are.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.962]  Or the Sheriff, or I am!
[00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:54.058]  And that goes into the grand juries, the juries, how they've been made these kept, enslaved, in the dark creatures who were told how to rule and told what to do when the founders in history in the Magna Carta states even before that, 1215 in England,
[00:38:55.319 --> 00:39:18.296]  That it is the jury that judges the law and the case, and if they think a law is unconstitutional or it's tyranny, or they don't respect it, and they knew not to trust the police and the government, that they were even above the king, and our ancestors fought incredible wars to get this basic right, and that's what everything is based on, and now they're abolishing the Magna Carta in England, and crowing and trumpeting they've done this.
[00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:22.359]  So, bottom line, if you don't stand up, you will be run over.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.440]  Correct.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:35.828]  And the overall question, and it asks the question specifically, to your sheriff, to your favorite peace officer, will you stand against tyranny?
[00:39:36.388 --> 00:39:37.469]  Well, there's only two answers.
[00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:39.771]  Yes, I will or no, I won't.
[00:39:39.951 --> 00:39:46.715]  If he won't, especially after you give him this information, then you've got to get rid of him or you've got to move somewhere else.
[00:39:47.395 --> 00:39:49.076]  The second one is, yes, I will.
[00:39:49.417 --> 00:39:51.458]  Then you convince him and show him
[00:39:52.384 --> 00:39:54.507]  When and where he should do that.
[00:39:55.189 --> 00:39:57.512]  We've got to stand behind the sheriff on this.
[00:40:02.008 --> 00:40:06.271]  You know, my life, I was a happy person, but I, you know, there was this emptiness.
[00:40:06.351 --> 00:40:10.714]  And when I studied history and studied what was happening, my life is so fulfilled, so dynamic.
[00:40:11.214 --> 00:40:12.435]  It is what you're meant to do.
[00:40:12.675 --> 00:40:16.177]  Men are meant to guard their hut, guard their village, guard their county.
[00:40:16.618 --> 00:40:17.658]  This is what humans do.
[00:40:17.678 --> 00:40:29.787]  I mean, it's the natural law that you become usurped or killed or enslaved if you don't stand up and aren't strong, and if you don't have justice, and that justice is what creates milk and honey and wonderful societies.
[00:40:30.107 --> 00:40:31.588]  How has your life changed
[00:40:32.348 --> 00:40:40.230]  Since you were a constitutional police officer and a constitutional sheriff and the fights you've led and the victories you've had, most of the time we fight back, we have victories.
[00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:41.070]  That's the big secret.
[00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:49.773]  And I just feel sorry for those that are involved in tyranny and rationalize it because they don't know that it isn't money or treasure or anything that life is about.
[00:40:50.413 --> 00:41:10.006]  It is literally about being a servant, and being a protector, and being a guardian, and that all of us, whether we're a police officer, or a sheriff's deputy, or a firefighter, or a military person, or a shopkeeper, we are all guardians, and that we have a job in life to be involved to fight evil, because evil is always in our society.
[00:41:10.026 --> 00:41:11.968]  So, what has that journey been like for you?
[00:41:12.988 --> 00:41:19.553]  Well, the first thing that I thought of when you said that, and I've even asked that question before, it's been a real rollercoaster ride.
[00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:22.210]  It has been lots of ups and lots of downs.
[00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:23.390]  Very exciting.
[00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:24.771]  Thrills.
[00:41:25.311 --> 00:41:32.834]  I thought I was going to die a few times, but my wife is hung with me and my kids have also, and I've got a good family.
[00:41:33.614 --> 00:41:35.535]  And it's brought us all fulfillment.
[00:41:35.955 --> 00:41:41.177]  And I've got the respect of my kids because they know that I stood for what I believed in.
[00:41:42.419 --> 00:41:47.840]  Even though it didn't bring us any money, in fact it did quite the opposite of that, but this has never been about money.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:56.522]  It's been about one thing, and one thing only, and that is standing and fighting for what I truly believe in, and this is what it has accomplished.
[00:41:56.762 --> 00:42:03.863]  Personally, I really feel that I've been able to make a little difference, and the good Lord put me on earth to make a difference.
[00:42:04.984 --> 00:42:07.024]  I believe that He's called me to this work.
[00:42:08.104 --> 00:42:09.865]  And I'm not going to turn my back on it.
[00:42:09.945 --> 00:42:10.786]  I'm not going to stop.
[00:42:11.346 --> 00:42:12.727]  I'm only 56 years old.
[00:42:13.348 --> 00:42:20.992]  I've got plenty of time left to stand and fight for this holy cause, just as Patrick Henry called it, the holy cause of liberty.
[00:42:21.713 --> 00:42:22.774]  We cannot give up.
[00:42:23.254 --> 00:42:27.417]  Friends and neighbors and everybody listening to this, do not give up.
[00:42:27.597 --> 00:42:35.602]  I've got speaking engagements about this very thing in Texas where people are inviting their sheriffs and favorite cops and deputies.
[00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:37.750]  I've got another one lined up in Ohio.
[00:42:38.551 --> 00:42:43.335]  I want to be doing this every weekend, so get on the website, sheriffmack.com.
[00:42:44.536 --> 00:42:50.481]  I'm going to try to put my schedule on there so you know, but anyway, give me an email, sheriffmack.hotmail.com.
[00:42:50.541 --> 00:42:51.522]  It's on my website.
[00:42:52.022 --> 00:42:52.763]  Give me a call.
[00:42:54.144 --> 00:42:56.025]  Drop me a line and let's make this movement.
[00:42:56.626 --> 00:43:03.011]  This movement can stop the New World Order, but we have got to get this information out
[00:43:03.702 --> 00:43:08.509]  Get the book for yourself, get one for your favorite cop, and definitely get one for your sheriff.
[00:43:09.029 --> 00:43:10.371]  And let's get this thing rolling.
[00:43:11.232 --> 00:43:13.515]  Alright, Sheriff Mack, I would just say this.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.341]  It isn't just physical courage.
[00:43:16.381 --> 00:43:22.783]  All the psychological studies show it's moral courage to admit you've been manipulated, to admit you've been indoctrinated and inculcated.
[00:43:24.004 --> 00:43:25.684]  We don't even ask people to think the way we do.
[00:43:25.724 --> 00:43:36.109]  Just look at history, look at what you're doing, look at what you're involved in, whether you're a business person or a police officer, whatever it is, and ask if this country's going in the right direction, and ask what you're doing.
[00:43:36.129 --> 00:43:43.792]  And all you silly yuppies that giggle and smirk and laugh about all this stuff, I told you the bankers were going to take everything you had because we had their own IMF World Bank documents.
[00:43:44.292 --> 00:43:45.432]  You know, this isn't a game.
[00:43:45.452 --> 00:43:46.933]  These guys aren't playing patty cake.
[00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:51.134]  The people running this new world order killed 200 plus million people last century, okay?
[00:43:51.614 --> 00:43:55.556]  So we don't stand up and fight these creatures, you know, just for fun.
[00:43:55.616 --> 00:44:02.518]  We do this because we know that there's no other choice and it is the best feeling and the most fulfilling thing in the world
[00:44:03.078 --> 00:44:06.321]  To just gut up, get past the fear, then you won't have it anymore.
[00:44:06.701 --> 00:44:08.583]  Once you go through fear, it's gone.
[00:44:09.104 --> 00:44:10.365]  And it is animating.
[00:44:10.405 --> 00:44:12.086]  The animating contest of liberty.
[00:44:12.147 --> 00:44:13.408]  You aren't living.
[00:44:13.848 --> 00:44:16.170]  Bungee jumping, you're not going to find this exhilaration.
[00:44:16.471 --> 00:44:17.752]  Partying, having sex.
[00:44:18.152 --> 00:44:22.774]  Doing drugs, getting drunk, you know, none of that is going to fulfill you.
[00:44:22.814 --> 00:44:31.618]  Being rich, being powerful, nothing is going to fulfill you like helping others and knowing what's going on in the world and not being a sucker and a chump.
[00:44:32.038 --> 00:44:36.320]  And we just really want to salute you Sheriff Richard Mack and we'll talk to you in the near future.
[00:44:37.001 --> 00:44:40.222]  Thanks a lot Alex and God bless you and thanks again for having me on.
[00:44:40.562 --> 00:44:41.563]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:44:43.504 --> 00:44:50.566]  Absolutely, you know, I think about how they can set me up, imprison me, how evil the feds are, how evil most of the states are now, and I'm not even worried about it.
[00:44:51.987 --> 00:44:58.168]  I worry about my little sweet, dear, darling, angelic children, but, you know, if nothing bad happens to them, that's the new world order, that's not me.
[00:44:58.869 --> 00:45:04.991]  I put it in God's hands, because they have no future, and other children have no future, if we don't stand up.
[00:45:05.091 --> 00:45:07.151]  If we give in to the fear, they win.
[00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:09.452]  If we fight, they lose.
[00:45:11.102 --> 00:45:13.704]  All you have to do is put yourself in motion.
[00:45:14.665 --> 00:45:18.808]  All you have to do is make the commitment to fight tyranny.
[00:45:19.369 --> 00:45:21.750]  In small ways, it will grow into great things.
[00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:23.632]  Victory is ours.
[00:45:24.092 --> 00:45:25.914]  Resistance is victory.
[00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:30.833]  Now, that said, we need your financial support here.
[00:45:31.534 --> 00:45:37.177]  And the ways we ask for financial support are buying the books and videos, making all the copies you want, getting PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, all of that.
[00:45:37.197 --> 00:45:43.260]  Because people say, Alex, you need to do this, you need to do that, you need to expand, you need to take action in all these ways.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.062]  And a lot of times I'd say, you know, what are you telling me to do more?
[00:45:47.128 --> 00:45:47.568]  But you know what?
[00:45:47.608 --> 00:45:48.389]  I'm taking the challenge.
[00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:49.189]  I am doing more.
[00:45:49.229 --> 00:45:51.610]  But if you ask me to do more, you have to support more.
[00:45:52.290 --> 00:46:01.214]  And the number one thing is telling your email list, your friends, your family, your neighbors, your community, about AM and FM stations we're on in your area, shortwave, internet, satellite, the free podcast.
[00:46:01.514 --> 00:46:02.855]  That's how this show grows!
[00:46:03.475 --> 00:46:04.256]  Are you doing that?
[00:46:04.396 --> 00:46:06.456]  I mean, it's one thing to almost take action.
[00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.297]  It's another thing to take action.
[00:46:08.597 --> 00:46:09.218]  That's the biggest thing.
[00:46:09.238 --> 00:46:11.479]  I think the show's the most effective, the best guest, the best info.
[00:46:11.659 --> 00:46:13.780]  We bring all these great activists that have had success.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.323]  At the state level, federal level, he's won at the Supreme Court, held back a lot of gun grabbing.
[00:46:19.504 --> 00:46:22.467]  And it's all because you, the core listeners, have supported these other people.
[00:46:22.487 --> 00:46:30.754]  We bring on here as a larger platform, but we need the platform itself to grow so that we can launch others.
[00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:36.939]  This, literally, we're like a Cape Canaveral rocket base, and we are launching, you know, ICBMs at the enemy.
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:42.544]  And we're trying to produce more info weapons and more powerful weapons to blow holes in the enemy.
[00:46:44.875 --> 00:46:46.617]  And we are going straight into the enemy.
[00:46:46.657 --> 00:46:47.678]  We are committed.
[00:46:48.098 --> 00:46:48.899]  We are focused.
[00:46:48.979 --> 00:46:56.126]  Now, I bring Ted Anderson up a couple times a week now because gold was $280 an ounce when I first started plugging it.
[00:46:59.108 --> 00:47:02.572]  Now it's gone up into $930, $940, $950 today.
[00:47:02.632 --> 00:47:03.993]  I haven't looked in the last few minutes.
[00:47:04.013 --> 00:47:07.276]  It's up at $940 something, $930 something and rising.
[00:47:08.918 --> 00:47:09.418]  And Ted
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.401]  Doesn't really even make money doing this.
[00:47:12.742 --> 00:47:17.905]  He buys the gold and silver when it's low, and he sells it when it's low, and he sells it when it's high.
[00:47:18.326 --> 00:47:21.468]  And he is at the very tail end of a purchase he made three weeks ago when gold was at $830.
[00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.052]  And Ted is the owner of this Genesis Network.
[00:47:26.932 --> 00:47:28.473]  By the way, Ted, I've been so busy I keep forgetting.
[00:47:28.493 --> 00:47:32.336]  Have you gotten my new Star Guide feed yet?
[00:47:32.356 --> 00:47:33.856]  I'm working on that right now.
[00:47:33.876 --> 00:47:36.978]  We just sent the equipment up to ABC so we can get that going.
[00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:38.399]  Leasing that feed?
[00:47:38.419 --> 00:47:40.481]  Yeah.
[00:47:40.561 --> 00:47:47.305]  We've got a T1 connection there, but we have to break it up with an AdTran modem-type unit.
[00:47:47.694 --> 00:47:55.161]  that can do that, and then we put the codex up there in order to transcode and get your voice back over to... Well, that's an example of what I'm saying.
[00:47:55.601 --> 00:48:13.116]  I'm on one ABC feed, but we're going to go, this radio show, 24 hours a day, except for Jason Bermas, on our own system with Ted, and it's Ted stepping up to pay the $5,000 a month, and the feds, a side issue, I want to bring this up now, Tim, and we'll hold you over to the next segment, the feds put out this line, we know they're feds,
[00:48:14.078 --> 00:48:17.791]  That we're owned by ABC and owned by the Saudi Arabians and that...
[00:48:19.528 --> 00:48:22.069]  This is the kind of lies they do, and that we're on ABC.
[00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:31.454]  Yes, you go out and you lease a Clear Channel, an ABC receiver, or a Jones receiver, those are the three, and radio station owners are laughing, and so are managers, they know.
[00:48:31.735 --> 00:48:37.698]  That's the piece of equipment, like you, you know, you contract for an ISDN line, you get it from AT&T, we're not owned by AT&T.
[00:48:38.178 --> 00:48:40.699]  But that shows how the feds operate, right?
[00:48:40.719 --> 00:48:42.680]  They're going, oh look, they're owned by ABC.
[00:48:42.741 --> 00:48:46.803]  No, this, any of you can call ABC and lease your own feed.
[00:48:47.563 --> 00:48:51.046]  And the reason we go with ABC is they don't restrict the fee.
[00:48:51.066 --> 00:48:56.091]  You can lease one from Clear Channel, but they won't let the stations have the encoders to get you off unless you're a Clear Channel show.
[00:48:56.591 --> 00:49:09.843]  And it's just so sick how I think of the fact that we're trying to get another satellite for the stations out there to deliver my show 24 hours a day so they can air it more, and then the enemy gets upset by that and lies to people and says that we're ABC.
[00:49:10.223 --> 00:49:11.705]  Can you explain that to folks, Ted?
[00:49:12.085 --> 00:49:13.609]  Well, yeah, I mean, as simple as this.
[00:49:13.689 --> 00:49:18.862]  I mean, it's the delivery mechanism that's used by all the radio shows out there in the marketplace.
[00:49:19.298 --> 00:49:20.058]  You're right about that.
[00:49:20.098 --> 00:49:32.162]  I did lease from Clear Channel for a little while, and unless if you're a premier group radio show like Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or some of these others that they produce, they won't open up their receivers.
[00:49:32.182 --> 00:49:33.962]  And they didn't tell you that when they leased it to you?
[00:49:34.202 --> 00:49:34.622]  Oh, no.
[00:49:34.702 --> 00:49:39.224]  I mean, I had to get out of a five-year contract, and I had to buy my way out of it.
[00:49:39.264 --> 00:49:39.964]  It was crazy.
[00:49:40.204 --> 00:49:43.045]  ABC just happens to open it up.
[00:49:43.185 --> 00:49:47.846]  Anybody that's picking up Paul Harvey or ABC News has a receiver.
[00:49:48.325 --> 00:49:50.305]  That can pick up the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:50.626 --> 00:50:05.549]  And if you want to syndicate in the marketplace, if you want to make any kind of a dent in the terrestrial market, meaning licensed AM and FM stations out there, you have to have an ABC Star Guide 3 feed, which is now developing into this new XDS receiver.
[00:50:06.129 --> 00:50:12.730]  My whole point is, we're doing a talk radio show, and you know, I have a Neumann Mic, German.
[00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:14.671]  I'm not owned by the Neumann Corporation.
[00:50:15.111 --> 00:50:17.433]  I have a Toshiba TV in front of me as a monitor.
[00:50:17.753 --> 00:50:19.095]  I'm not owned by Toshiba.
[00:50:19.135 --> 00:50:21.877]  I'm just saying, listeners, this is what the Feds do.
[00:50:21.897 --> 00:50:26.181]  It makes me angry, not that they're putting the lies out, but that people are so gullible.
[00:50:26.561 --> 00:50:28.723]  Like there's a porno magazine called Genesis.
[00:50:28.883 --> 00:50:33.107]  They claim we're owned by the porno magazine, when there's hundreds of companies called Genesis.
[00:50:33.507 --> 00:50:38.031]  Another writer put out a lie, because there was some Genesis thing with some Saudi Arabian.
[00:50:39.472 --> 00:50:45.462]  I think you ought to post on the site your charter, your corporate charter, that it's a Ted Anderson company.
[00:50:45.502 --> 00:50:49.108]  I'm tired of the feds running black ops and people believing it, Ted.
[00:50:49.468 --> 00:50:50.510]  Yeah, and there's a lot of...
[00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:53.050]  Funny information.
[00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:57.312]  I think, you know, I think you ought to just sue one of those people just to teach people a lesson.
[00:50:57.772 --> 00:50:58.633]  That's a good idea.
[00:50:58.653 --> 00:51:00.113]  I mean, I know you sue people.
[00:51:00.153 --> 00:51:01.414]  You need to go ahead and just sue them.
[00:51:01.774 --> 00:51:07.597]  Because I'm tired of them getting, you know, we need to get aggressive and start hammering people and call them in court and go, now listen, you bastard liar!
[00:51:08.057 --> 00:51:09.998]  You talk, you tell the judge what's going on!
[00:51:10.828 --> 00:51:20.594]  SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand knives such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, K-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.
[00:51:20.754 --> 00:51:24.696]  South Summit has one of the largest selections of self-defense products on the web.
[00:51:24.836 --> 00:51:34.662]  Knives, stun guns, police batons, pepper spray, LED flashlights, emergency kits, binoculars, and tactical gear are just some of the great products found on SouthSummit.com.

[00:52:04.771 --> 00:52:06.232]  1-800-234-8654.
[00:52:06.292 --> 00:52:07.673]  That's 1-800-234-8654.
[00:52:07.733 --> 00:52:17.279]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.341]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:20.273 --> 00:52:21.294]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:21.834 --> 00:52:22.335]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:22.635 --> 00:52:23.575]  This is his M.O.s.
[00:52:23.595 --> 00:52:24.976]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:24.997 --> 00:52:26.638]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:26.998 --> 00:52:33.743]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:34.143 --> 00:52:34.584]  Some U.S.
[00:52:34.624 --> 00:52:40.268]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:40.968 --> 00:52:44.449]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:44.469 --> 00:52:46.610]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:12.597 --> 00:53:14.580]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:53:15.161 --> 00:53:17.664]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:53:18.245 --> 00:53:22.411]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.921]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:53:25.282 --> 00:53:28.304]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:53:28.664 --> 00:53:31.686]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:53:31.987 --> 00:53:43.375]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:53:43.776 --> 00:53:50.200]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and tobacco.
[00:53:50.981 --> 00:53:51.421]  I think so.
[00:54:13.922 --> 00:54:16.444]  They came and took it all away, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:16.785 --> 00:54:19.827]  You know, Ted, I didn't mean to get sidetracked.
[00:54:20.007 --> 00:54:23.030]  I just got into radio stuff with you here on air.
[00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:24.751]  We've been so busy, I hadn't talked to you about that.
[00:54:24.792 --> 00:54:29.656]  Jason Vermas' show starts 9 to midnight, Central, March 1st.
[00:54:29.676 --> 00:54:30.957]  A couple Thursdays from now.
[00:54:30.977 --> 00:54:34.000]  And I just know what a good guy you are and how hard you work.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.363]  Everything you've done and the Fed's little lies about you really make me mad.
[00:54:39.224 --> 00:54:46.132]  I think I'll look at suing one or two of these people just to, you know, it'll be a court record of their lives and get a judgment against them, but that's a side issue.
[00:54:46.413 --> 00:54:47.974]  I'm glad you're going to get us another satellite feed.
[00:54:47.994 --> 00:54:48.695]  Good job, Ted.
[00:54:49.997 --> 00:54:55.583]  Let's get into the gold here in the four minutes that we have got left here today.
[00:54:56.184 --> 00:54:57.605]  You are at the very tail end.
[00:54:57.665 --> 00:55:00.067]  And folks, he told you this one was at $700 and that ran out.
[00:55:00.407 --> 00:55:01.929]  And then it was $800 and then $830.
[00:55:01.989 --> 00:55:02.990]  It's about to run out.
[00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:07.733]  He was able, at that original price, to get some more Sovereigns, British Sovereigns and Franks.
[00:55:07.873 --> 00:55:09.194]  Where is gold right now, Ted?
[00:55:10.455 --> 00:55:12.297]  Gold today has seen $948.80.
[00:55:12.337 --> 00:55:13.518]  It's down by just about $2.
[00:55:13.678 --> 00:55:13.858]  It's up $27.
[00:55:13.918 --> 00:55:14.138]  It's at $944.10.
[00:55:14.239 --> 00:55:16.560]  I did some math on the British Sovereigns.
[00:55:24.056 --> 00:55:27.098]  Currently, right now, they're at $288 when I buy them.
[00:55:27.558 --> 00:55:28.679]  Right now, I'm carrying them for $265.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:41.928]  Four of them put together make an ounce, so I took the difference of $23 from where they would be today to what I'm offering them for, and it comes out to be $92 per ounce.
[00:55:41.948 --> 00:55:43.409]  I also have the French Frank.
[00:55:43.469 --> 00:55:45.150]  I did the math on that one as well.
[00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:49.713]  They are up $19 from where I'm carrying them right now.
[00:55:50.053 --> 00:55:50.573]  They're at $235.
[00:55:51.174 --> 00:55:51.814]  I've got them at $217.
[00:55:53.393 --> 00:56:02.017]  You multiply that by five because it's a fifth of an ounce, $95 above and beyond where they're trading at right now per ounce.
[00:56:02.357 --> 00:56:03.198]  That's the difference.
[00:56:03.438 --> 00:56:05.679]  I mean, the silver market right now is even higher.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.201]  Silver currently right now today is at $13.72.
[00:56:10.421 --> 00:56:15.024]  I have the silver dollars, not the silver dollars, I wish I had them.
[00:56:15.324 --> 00:56:17.285]  I have the walking liberty halves and the dimes.
[00:56:17.665 --> 00:56:18.205]  Half dollars.
[00:56:18.225 --> 00:56:21.407]  Back when it was down at $9 an ounce when silver was down there.
[00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:25.533]  The same price as the dimes currently right now are at $1,590 per $100 face value.
[00:56:25.553 --> 00:56:30.157]  Is it safe to say this is the best deal you've ever offered?
[00:56:30.197 --> 00:56:32.319]  Well, Alex, I haven't ever offered it for this.
[00:56:37.043 --> 00:56:43.044]  Not like this before, and you know, again, I mean, I talked to more than my price.
[00:56:43.064 --> 00:56:50.246]  This is priced at $114 less than the market is right now, and most places don't even have gold or silver, and when they do, they put huge premiums over it.
[00:56:50.306 --> 00:56:52.567]  This is an insane deal.
[00:56:52.967 --> 00:56:54.207]  How long are you offering it?
[00:56:54.327 --> 00:56:57.568]  Well, Alex, I can't offer this past midnight tonight.
[00:56:57.588 --> 00:56:58.348]  There's no way.
[00:56:58.368 --> 00:57:02.109]  Unless if I can have a huge drop in gold, it ain't gonna happen.
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:06.822]  I mean, I'm watching the argument that's going on in Washington, D.C.
[00:57:07.322 --> 00:57:15.966]  about this stimulus package, and then right behind that, the Secretary of Treasury asking for like $3 trillion to bail out the banks again.
[00:57:15.986 --> 00:57:18.948]  And last time, $700 billion turned into $8.5 trillion.
[00:57:19.468 --> 00:57:27.512]  Bloomberg reports the bailouts now at $9.7 trillion, that's the newest number, so $3 trillion would be three times that of what they always left, which we're talking about $30 trillion.
[00:57:28.132 --> 00:57:30.593]  I mean, these numbers don't... It's insane.
[00:57:30.653 --> 00:57:31.633]  Protect yourselves now.
[00:57:31.933 --> 00:57:33.334]  They're hyper-inflating the currency.
[00:57:33.374 --> 00:57:34.314]  There's no doubt of that.
[00:57:34.674 --> 00:57:40.577]  Give the brokers a call on the francs, on the sovereigns, and on the half dollars and the dimes in silver.
[00:57:40.597 --> 00:57:41.037]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:41.157]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:57:41.177 --> 00:57:42.637]  And that's good through midnight, February 11th.
[00:57:42.697 --> 00:57:44.798]  That's a nice birthday present from me to everybody.
[00:57:44.818 --> 00:57:46.159]  Today's my birthday, Ted.
[00:57:53.121 --> 00:57:55.042]  Oh, wow, happy birthday, I forgot about that.
[00:57:55.062 --> 00:57:57.122]  I'm getting to be an old man now, I'm 35.
[00:57:57.462 --> 00:57:59.443]  Well, you're getting to be an old man, all right.
[00:58:01.184 --> 00:58:02.404]  I'm a lot of miles on there.
[00:58:02.824 --> 00:58:12.867]  Oh, well, I tell you what, every year goes by and the amount of people that are listening to this show and how it grows, I can't tell you, Alex, I am so appreciative of what you've done.
[00:58:13.287 --> 00:58:15.848]  No, I'm appreciative of the listener spreading the word.
[00:58:16.629 --> 00:58:17.689]  So where is Silver right now?
[00:58:18.289 --> 00:58:23.054]  Uh, silver currently right now $13 and uh... And you're selling it at the $9 level?
[00:58:23.394 --> 00:58:23.834]  Yeah.
[00:58:23.894 --> 00:58:26.977]  What's it priced in at $9?
[00:58:27.397 --> 00:58:32.282]  $800, $686, $2237, and you're pricing gold at $114 less than the market is?
[00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:34.704]  Yeah, right now at this time you can't beat that.
[00:58:34.804 --> 00:58:35.625]  I know that my compa...
[00:58:36.032 --> 00:58:37.633]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:00.694 --> 00:59:02.255]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:02.375 --> 00:59:06.977]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:07.117 --> 00:59:09.878]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:10.078 --> 00:59:12.939]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:13.119 --> 00:59:17.841]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:18.061 --> 00:59:19.002]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:19.202 --> 00:59:22.144]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:22.444 --> 00:59:29.330]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:32.552]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:49.065 --> 00:59:50.506]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:00:03.439 --> 01:00:05.341]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:08.764]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:18.413]  We are back live, now already into the final hour.
[01:00:19.054 --> 01:00:21.136]  State Representative Jim Gass will be joining us.
[01:00:21.156 --> 01:00:22.437]  They're getting him off the floor right now.
[01:00:22.477 --> 01:00:23.218]  He's in Missouri.
[01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:28.797]  Ten states and another 20, according to Jack McClain, are moving to declare sovereignty.
[01:00:28.817 --> 01:00:30.879]  They're talking about martial law, gun confiscations.
[01:00:31.319 --> 01:00:34.722]  Now they're not going along with compulsory slavery, a new domestic draft.
[01:00:35.162 --> 01:00:35.963]  Obama's pushing.
[01:00:36.043 --> 01:00:37.224]  This is exciting.
[01:00:37.624 --> 01:00:38.424]  We're on the march.
[01:00:38.465 --> 01:00:39.545]  The empire is on the run.
[01:00:40.046 --> 01:00:45.770]  Ted Anderson's gone now, but you just heard him do that gold pitch from gold he bought when it was at $830 level.
[01:00:48.942 --> 01:00:52.505]  Just amazing deal on precious metals in stock.
[01:00:52.525 --> 01:00:55.006]  800-686-2237.
[01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:55.066]  800-686-2237.
[01:00:57.328 --> 01:00:58.909]  Take advantage of this or you're crazy.
[01:00:58.929 --> 01:01:01.931]  In fact, I'm going to take advantage of it every six months or so.
[01:01:01.951 --> 01:01:03.112]  I'll buy a little bit of silver and gold.
[01:01:03.392 --> 01:01:04.373]  This deal is just too good.
[01:01:04.393 --> 01:01:05.574]  800-686-2237.
[01:01:05.594 --> 01:01:10.377]  Okay, we are back live now into the fourth hour.
[01:01:11.018 --> 01:01:12.739]  Coming up, I'm going to get into Madoff's wife.
[01:01:12.779 --> 01:01:14.941]  Pulled $15 million before his arrest out of Reuters.
[01:01:15.461 --> 01:01:16.302]  They've got a new drug czar.
[01:01:16.322 --> 01:01:17.343]  We're going to be going over all that.
[01:01:17.383 --> 01:01:19.125]  Time Magazine calls for a world government.
[01:01:19.846 --> 01:01:24.491]  And this issue, titled the New World Order, saying a foreign bank will control the United States.
[01:01:24.572 --> 01:01:25.693]  See, this has been the plan.
[01:01:26.594 --> 01:01:29.157]  The good news is ten states now have legislation introduced.
[01:01:29.177 --> 01:01:30.478]  It was eight last Friday.
[01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:31.139]  Now it's ten.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.601]  Twenty more looking at it.
[01:01:33.582 --> 01:01:34.964]  And we've been having people on from
[01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:40.093]  Oklahoma and from Washington and from New Hampshire, more from New Hampshire.
[01:01:40.733 --> 01:01:44.616]  Throughout this week and next week we're having these great patriots, these great men and women on.
[01:01:44.656 --> 01:01:56.646]  Representative Jim Guest has introduced HCR 13, claims sovereignty of the United States under the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution for all powers, not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government under the Constitution.
[01:01:57.126 --> 01:01:58.988]  Now that's already enshrined
[01:02:01.152 --> 01:02:08.938]  Well, it's an honor for me to be on and visit with the people of this great country and help them join our forces here to... It's sad that we have to have a wake-up call to take back the powers that supposedly are ours.
[01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:26.087]  Absolutely.
[01:02:26.107 --> 01:02:32.635]  We're going to break in a moment and come back and talk more about it, but what spurred you to introduce this and how is it going and what does it cover?
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.743]  I guess it probably started a couple years ago when this Real ID Act came out.
[01:02:37.783 --> 01:02:40.566]  That was also a direct violation of the 10th Amendment.
[01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:44.509]  And we started down the road to get states to enact legislation to oppose that.
[01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:51.274]  And we kept citing it was a direct violation of about three or four amendments in the Bill of Rights and obviously the 10th.
[01:02:51.334 --> 01:03:00.362]  And as we got on down there in a bit with other legislators around the country, I thought we need to make a concerted and united effort here to file some legislation to
[01:03:01.098 --> 01:03:05.600]  Notify our federal government that we're going to take back those rights delineated in the 10th Amendment.
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.140]  So that's kind of what was behind it there.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:11.002]  Have you seen the New Hampshire one that says, we're saying no to martial law?
[01:03:11.502 --> 01:03:12.842]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:13.162 --> 01:03:14.823]  What do you think of that?
[01:03:14.983 --> 01:03:16.724]  That was a very bold step.
[01:03:16.744 --> 01:03:25.547]  I presented my HCR 13, the 10th Amendment rights here in my committee yesterday morning, and I briefly noted it.
[01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:29.188]  I said, if you think this language is a little bit strong, you need to read the New Hampshire where it says,
[01:03:29.967 --> 01:03:33.891]  If they violate any of these, we're going to nullify the Constitution and start all over again.
[01:03:33.971 --> 01:03:37.675]  So yes, I commend them for that very brave and bold step they're taking.
[01:03:38.156 --> 01:03:40.699]  And New Hampshire has the strongest state constitution.
[01:03:41.239 --> 01:03:47.466]  It's even better in powers delegated to the state and the people than even the federal, the only one that I know of that's even stronger.
[01:03:47.486 --> 01:03:52.211]  And it states, right to revolt, and they're basically preparing for right to revolt clause.
[01:03:53.243 --> 01:03:53.764]  That's right.
[01:03:53.844 --> 01:03:57.327]  I just reiterated that in a committee meeting.
[01:03:57.387 --> 01:03:59.629]  I kind of went over the high points of it.
[01:03:59.749 --> 01:04:10.659]  I said, you know, this is no wonder they call it a live freer die state up there and we need more patriots and more people around the country to stand up with what they're starting there.
[01:04:11.621 --> 01:04:18.206]  I want to go over your concerns about federal control because it's not even federal, it's international.
[01:04:18.746 --> 01:04:23.309]  Time Magazine says it is a world government run by private banks, so they can't call us kooks.
[01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:31.695]  Wall Street Journal is calling for North American Union and getting rid of the dollar and letting a foreign bank, and we're being taken over like a third world country by foreign banks.
[01:04:32.175 --> 01:04:40.561]  We are, and that's one of the efforts we've been working on here is a resolution with other states to make people aware of this North American Union and the
[01:04:41.221 --> 01:04:42.742]  The One World Government is coming on.
[01:04:42.782 --> 01:04:49.265]  You know, people kind of made light of it for several years when all of a sudden the lights started to come on and they realized what's taking place.
[01:04:49.305 --> 01:04:56.149]  But it's difficult when some of these powers get that far down the road before you can get people to take action on it.
[01:04:56.169 --> 01:04:59.491]  But it's never too late until the doors close.
[01:04:59.531 --> 01:05:00.311]  So we need to work on it.
[01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:00.692]  That's right.
[01:05:00.992 --> 01:05:01.952]  And we turned the lights on.
[01:05:01.972 --> 01:05:04.173]  There were a million New World Order cockroaches in there.
[01:05:04.574 --> 01:05:08.776]  Representative Jim Guess from Missouri, a great patriot, he'll be back with us after this break.
[01:05:11.525 --> 01:05:14.967]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:09.973]  Act now!
[01:06:09.993 --> 01:06:17.297]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:17.657 --> 01:06:19.318]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:20.293 --> 01:06:21.314]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:21.834 --> 01:06:22.355]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:22.655 --> 01:06:23.636]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:23.656 --> 01:06:24.937]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:25.017 --> 01:06:26.639]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:27.019 --> 01:06:33.745]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:34.145 --> 01:06:34.586]  Some U.S.
[01:06:34.626 --> 01:06:40.291]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:44.472]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:44.492 --> 01:06:47.272]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:10.903 --> 01:07:14.197]  Aging doesn't only show in your face, but it can be felt in your body.
[01:07:14.559 --> 01:07:15.423]  You feel tired.
[01:07:15.734 --> 01:07:19.016]  Your joints and muscles ache, and your mind seems clouded and forgetful.

[01:08:12.276 --> 01:08:18.304]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.905 --> 01:08:21.949]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.231 --> 01:08:29.259]  The United States, the jewel and the crown of this world, has been seized by offshore banks publicly.
[01:08:31.004 --> 01:08:41.113]  And if we don't address just how dire things are, just how out of control things are, with Newsweek saying we're now a socialist nation, we're all socialists now, we're not going to be able to turn this around.
[01:08:41.873 --> 01:08:44.155]  No more time to play patty cake or mince words.
[01:08:44.256 --> 01:08:48.840]  This is tyrannical world government at point-blank range attacking our country and looting it.
[01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:56.413]  They got all these scared people saying, we'll do whatever you say, take our rights away, just give us, you know, money, give us jobs.
[01:08:56.673 --> 01:09:04.876]  When the very same crew filling Obama's administration, if you thought Bush was bad, are the very people in the Clinton administration who changed the banking rules to engage in this criminal looting.
[01:09:04.976 --> 01:09:06.457]  A bunch of made-offs, basically.
[01:09:07.261 --> 01:09:20.432]  We've got a representative guest on with us, and I appreciate Jim Guest joining us from Missouri, District 5, Republican, and I told you it was 8 states, I guess he's the 9th because he introduced it yesterday.
[01:09:20.452 --> 01:09:23.635]  It's up to 10 now, and 20 more looking at it.
[01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:33.442]  Why did you, I mean looking at things happening, run over the thought process of introducing this, where it's going, how we help you get this passed.
[01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:37.985]  I know I'm on a couple stations, like the fine station KCXL out of Kansas City.
[01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:45.270]  How do folks put pressure, as you know the foreign bankers are lobbying, putting pressure against you guys to not save the republic.
[01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:46.671]  How do we help you?
[01:09:46.931 --> 01:09:47.991]  A. Why'd you do this?
[01:09:48.071 --> 01:09:48.932]  What's the main threats?
[01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:50.073]  B. How do we help you?
[01:09:51.676 --> 01:10:02.182]  The main reason is I've got two grandchildren and I keep telling people I want them to grow up in the world I have.
[01:10:02.262 --> 01:10:09.407]  The last thing I want to do is sit on the front step of my house and tell my two granddaughters I can remember back when America used to be free.
[01:10:09.467 --> 01:10:13.089]  I don't want them to ask me what it was like, Grandpa, when America was free.
[01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:14.930]  That's one of the main reasons I'm working this far.
[01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:15.726]  I don't
[01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:35.313]  We've got a number of legislators around the country doing so.
[01:10:35.393 --> 01:10:41.179]  It's a concern today, but it's more of a concern of what's going to happen tomorrow if we don't take action today.
[01:10:41.379 --> 01:10:44.883]  Like you said, it's not tomorrow we need to take action, it's today.
[01:10:44.903 --> 01:10:51.229]  I keep saying we're at the crossroads and whatever freedoms and rights we lose, we're never going to get them back.
[01:10:54.372 --> 01:10:55.073]  We're good to go.
[01:11:22.341 --> 01:11:25.042]  We join here and how can people in Missouri help?
[01:11:25.522 --> 01:11:26.162]  Pretty easy.
[01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:34.784]  They find out who their legislators are on the committee, call their legislators and tell them to support this HCR 13.
[01:11:36.264 --> 01:11:41.125]  And I've also got a bill out there, House Bill 361, to reject the REAL ID Act.
[01:11:41.145 --> 01:11:44.246]  Those both go in pretty close together.
[01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:51.248]  The REAL ID Act is another tank for Big Brother to start watching us and controlling us and tracking our every movement.
[01:11:52.432 --> 01:11:55.514]  Those two bills are ones I'm working on today.
[01:11:57.035 --> 01:11:58.836]  Well, you know, people want solutions.
[01:11:58.856 --> 01:11:59.397]  This is it.
[01:11:59.837 --> 01:12:09.444]  This is the remedy in the Constitution, next to the cartridge box, is the states, and I hope we don't have to go to that, for the states to say no and stand up and declare their sovereignty.
[01:12:10.764 --> 01:12:14.987]  And, you know, we're now, as you said, I said that earlier, hours ago, this is the big crossroads.
[01:12:15.047 --> 01:12:15.928]  I totally agree with you.
[01:12:16.148 --> 01:12:18.450]  And the good news is the bad news.
[01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:20.231]  And I'll take the bad first.
[01:12:20.271 --> 01:12:22.252]  The bad news is they've taken the gloves off.
[01:12:22.292 --> 01:12:34.097]  They're openly announcing world government FEMA camps, forced compulsory service, national goon squads, carbon taxes that will shut down what's left of our industry, open borders, tracking and tracing.
[01:12:34.117 --> 01:12:42.301]  I mean, it was in Bloomberg yesterday that in the stimulus package is the total federalization of health care, where doctors have to be told by the government what treatments they could do.
[01:12:42.341 --> 01:12:48.004]  And in there it says, over 55, it says in the bill, they would deny this before, they said this is the British model.
[01:12:48.824 --> 01:12:51.165]  And we're just going to let old folks go blind.
[01:12:51.185 --> 01:12:52.186]  We're not going to give you the surgery.
[01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:53.466]  We're not going to give you brain surgery.
[01:12:53.747 --> 01:12:54.667]  You're going to have to wait.
[01:12:55.047 --> 01:12:56.768]  The young people will get the health care.
[01:12:56.968 --> 01:12:58.369]  Actual rationing.
[01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:02.511]  So the good news is the bad news.
[01:13:02.531 --> 01:13:06.793]  The bad news is they're out in the open with classic tyranny and corruption and abuse and control.
[01:13:07.654 --> 01:13:10.175]  But that's also the good news because it's so outrageous.
[01:13:10.215 --> 01:13:11.516]  How could we not beat this?
[01:13:13.357 --> 01:13:14.277]  So please speak to that.
[01:13:14.577 --> 01:13:17.879]  And why do you think government is going so hog wild right now?
[01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:27.986]  I think they've been successful in the past in stepping on us, and without people revolting, I think maybe it is, as they say, time for another revolution here.
[01:13:29.487 --> 01:13:43.676]  We've quietly gone along here until these last, I'm not sure, three or four years, they take away our rights and people kind of go along with it, and now they think that we won't put up any resistance, but then that's why it's so great.
[01:13:44.938 --> 01:13:48.021]  I'm so glad to see so many states stepping forward now.
[01:13:48.362 --> 01:13:54.108]  I think I just feel like that they've got the upper hand, which they do have, and they're going to continue with it.
[01:13:54.148 --> 01:13:59.053]  So they feel that the states won't revolt, won't resist.
[01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:07.137]  They've got the people in a state of fear out there that they're not going to have a job or not going to have any money.
[01:14:07.497 --> 01:14:18.369]  And if the federal government gives them a few dollars to put in their pocket, then they'll owe them and they'll be grateful for what they have, not realizing what they've lost in the meantime and getting to that point.
[01:14:19.192 --> 01:14:20.093]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:14:20.113 --> 01:14:26.836]  Ron Paul said a million times, and it's true historically, we could lose our whole economy tomorrow, but if we had liberty, we would rebuild it very quickly.
[01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:30.258]  Liberty is the engine of milk and honey.
[01:14:30.298 --> 01:14:33.700]  It is the engine of a great, free, beautiful society.
[01:14:34.041 --> 01:14:38.583]  Socialism and corruption always devastates everything in its path.
[01:14:39.224 --> 01:14:40.184]  So can you speak to that?
[01:14:40.224 --> 01:14:41.905]  I mean, you talk about your grandchildren and children.
[01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:43.146]  I'm the same with three children.
[01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:48.289]  I mean, I look at them, and I'm not worried about the Fed setting me up or demonizing me or
[01:14:48.909 --> 01:14:50.930]  You know, even killing me, and I've had death threats.
[01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:54.091]  It's like, my God, there's not even a choice here.
[01:14:54.231 --> 01:14:58.033]  I have to fight these people to the bitter end, whatever the cost is.
[01:14:58.053 --> 01:15:00.054]  I am going to the end.
[01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:05.676]  And I can see with you and many other reps we're having on, I've never heard this type of commitment from Ron Paul and many others.
[01:15:06.036 --> 01:15:13.299]  There is now a commitment because it's clear our worst ideas on this were correct.
[01:15:13.359 --> 01:15:14.660]  It's even worse than we had thought.
[01:15:15.714 --> 01:15:17.736]  Yeah, you mention a good point there.
[01:15:18.196 --> 01:15:31.688]  Some of us older people are willing to put up some resistance and I think they realize that and that's why they've sort of maybe left us alone and they're trying to indoctrinate the young children and the fact that they accept putting a
[01:15:32.657 --> 01:15:45.844]  A biometric fingerprint or something, or accepting a chip implanted in them, so they know that that's where they're going to start at a young age, indoctrinating them to be under their control, and that way they can form their habits from the very beginning.
[01:15:46.525 --> 01:15:56.810]  And that's where our education process has to go to make sure that the young people are aware of the downfalls and the pits that await them out there and get them to join our cause.
[01:15:56.950 --> 01:16:01.453]  And we have some younger people getting involved here, and I think they're the ones that realize
[01:16:02.492 --> 01:16:02.672]  There's a
[01:16:18.993 --> 01:16:25.214]  The price that we're going to have to pay to get it stopped out there, because the price in the future will be many times greater than that.
[01:16:25.715 --> 01:16:28.915]  Well, what would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[01:16:29.235 --> 01:16:29.876]  Absolutely.
[01:16:29.916 --> 01:16:37.297]  They're going to give people a few hundred dollar tax credit, but meanwhile, give trillions to offshore banks and fully federalize everything.
[01:16:37.757 --> 01:16:42.058]  And I see these poor fools crying when Obama got elected, saying, my problems are all solved.
[01:16:42.658 --> 01:16:44.459]  I won't have to worry about bills ever again.
[01:16:45.239 --> 01:16:52.823]  And then he went from hope and change, it's all going to be fixed, to it's going to go from a crisis to a catastrophe, do whatever I say, or your life's basically over.
[01:16:53.203 --> 01:16:54.944]  Is that not psychological terrorism?
[01:16:55.585 --> 01:16:56.005]  It is.
[01:16:56.025 --> 01:17:03.169]  You know, they keep saying, gosh, two months ago we had to do this bailout overnight, or things were going to collapse.
[01:17:03.249 --> 01:17:06.410]  Well, we're at the point now that it hasn't helped.
[01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:09.792]  And right now they're going to say, you know, we've got to get this money, we've got to spend it now.
[01:17:10.312 --> 01:17:12.554]  And people are buying into that.
[01:17:14.076 --> 01:17:20.399]  They're accepting this few dollars as part of their socialism that they're heading down to.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:26.923]  I'm really concerned about this government owning our banks and our financial institutions.
[01:17:27.003 --> 01:17:32.205]  I think that is another disaster in the making there, big time.
[01:17:32.686 --> 01:17:38.869]  It's a shame that our country got so out of hand here and we let these powers for so long be in control.
[01:17:39.628 --> 01:17:46.249]  Isn't that what the Founding Fathers and others like Andrew Jackson, all they did was fight the domination of bankers?
[01:17:46.909 --> 01:17:47.490]  Absolutely.
[01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:57.232]  You go back and you look at the Federal Reserve System and the banks that they had there, they realized the dilemma that would happen if a government had a central bank.
[01:17:57.872 --> 01:18:02.873]  And they had one for 20 years and then they abolished it and in 1913 they started with
[01:18:04.873 --> 01:18:05.493]  We're good to go.
[01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:38.354]  Well, that's what we're doing, is every Fed location, late last year we went out and protested.
[01:18:38.674 --> 01:18:43.457]  The people are looking past the puppets, the Bushes, the Obamas, to the real power structure.
[01:18:44.017 --> 01:18:48.720]  And I think that's why the establishment's racing to finish their new world order, because they know their time is short.
[01:18:49.601 --> 01:18:50.421]  You bet.
[01:18:51.062 --> 01:18:59.007]  I have to admit, sir, years ago I kind of questioned this one world order, but then when you start looking around, it became more involved in it.
[01:18:59.087 --> 01:19:01.128]  You can see what's taking place here.
[01:19:01.188 --> 01:19:02.029]  You can see the
[01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:22.846]  European Union and the African Union and the Mideast Union and the North American Union taking place and all of a sudden you see these pieces starting to come together and realize there are a few people that this one world order is quite feasible and it's heading towards that in a too fast a pace to make us comfortable.
[01:19:23.732 --> 01:19:24.072]  You're right.
[01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:38.251]  I want to do a final segment with you, if you can, five more minutes after this break, to talk about, again, on the ground, how we get other states, how you recommend listeners introduce your bill, you know, bring it to state legislators, and Texas is going into session, other states.
[01:19:38.872 --> 01:19:43.615]  Because people are angry, and this is, I think, one of the best solutions.
[01:19:44.056 --> 01:19:49.259]  For those that don't know, this film, The Money Masters, covers the history of the international bankers.
[01:19:49.679 --> 01:20:02.948]  This is what Thomas Jefferson had to say, if the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[01:20:03.849 --> 01:20:08.575]  The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.
[01:20:08.635 --> 01:20:10.197]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:14.582]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[01:20:15.162 --> 01:20:17.665]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:22.411]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[01:20:23.163 --> 01:20:24.923]  You know that you need to prepare.
[01:20:25.283 --> 01:20:28.304]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[01:20:28.664 --> 01:20:31.665]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[01:20:31.985 --> 01:20:43.348]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:20:43.768 --> 01:20:50.009]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and tobacco.
[01:20:50.109 --> 01:20:54.870]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:21:15.106 --> 01:21:20.529]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:22.070]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:26.173]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:21:26.813 --> 01:21:40.061]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:21:40.601 --> 01:21:45.923]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:21:46.203 --> 01:21:52.166]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:21:52.846 --> 01:21:54.647]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:55.707 --> 01:21:58.888]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:21:59.308 --> 01:21:59.909]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:59.929 --> 01:22:02.109]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:22:02.129 --> 01:22:02.190]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:10.382 --> 01:22:12.384]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:22:12.504 --> 01:22:14.907]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:22:14.927 --> 01:22:17.510]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:18.731]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:20.393]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:22:20.473 --> 01:22:27.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:22:36.648 --> 01:22:42.672]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:22:42.772 --> 01:22:43.392]  An inside job.
[01:22:45.314 --> 01:22:46.394]  How dare you?
[01:22:47.935 --> 01:22:52.837]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:22:52.977 --> 01:22:55.618]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:22:55.698 --> 01:23:02.140]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:04.761]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:23:05.021 --> 01:23:07.022]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:09.763]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:23:10.874 --> 01:23:16.336]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:23:16.376 --> 01:23:16.896]  and the world.
[01:23:17.156 --> 01:23:20.618]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:27.260]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:29.321]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:23:29.561 --> 01:23:34.783]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[01:23:34.983 --> 01:23:35.283]  I think so.
[01:23:53.069 --> 01:23:55.551]  I was a highway man Along the coach roads I did ride
[01:24:22.549 --> 01:24:24.570]  You know what's exciting?
[01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:36.798]  There's a lot of bad things going on in a lot of tyranny, but tyranny always overreaches, and it always falls.
[01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:40.760]  Then people get liberty, and then they become complacent again, and it rises again.
[01:24:52.236 --> 01:24:54.579]  But, uh, they're coming out in the open with their world government now.
[01:24:55.119 --> 01:24:57.402]  Their FEMA camps, their NORTHCOM over the states.
[01:24:57.822 --> 01:24:59.064]  They know the threat is the states.
[01:24:59.104 --> 01:25:01.166]  That's why NORTHCOM says the governors are abolished.
[01:25:01.587 --> 01:25:04.730]  Federal officers wearing dual hats serving at the pleasure of the president.
[01:25:05.211 --> 01:25:07.573]  NORTHCOM admits they want to use 20,000 combat U.S.
[01:25:07.613 --> 01:25:08.674]  troops against the American people.
[01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:13.001]  They'll stage events to try to bring it in and have people accept it, but they're not going to get away with it.
[01:25:13.521 --> 01:25:15.142]  So the show is on the road.
[01:25:15.162 --> 01:25:17.584]  A lot of people say, let's get the show on the road.
[01:25:17.624 --> 01:25:23.028]  Well, a lot of you talkers are going to have a chance now, because we're desperately here trying to fix things peaceably.
[01:25:24.109 --> 01:25:26.751]  Those of you that want to fight, don't worry, the enemy's going to start fights.
[01:25:27.031 --> 01:25:28.132]  The globalists are going to push it.
[01:25:29.033 --> 01:25:30.995]  And I hope we can avert this.
[01:25:31.375 --> 01:25:34.818]  In closing, Representative Jim Gast introducing this great bill.
[01:25:36.141 --> 01:25:37.762]  They're in the Missouri State House.
[01:25:38.523 --> 01:25:40.405]  We just commend you for what you're doing.
[01:25:41.666 --> 01:25:43.948]  Again, how do people support you?
[01:25:44.888 --> 01:25:47.611]  How do people get this into other state legislatures?
[01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:53.195]  I think one of yours is one of the best pieces of legislation I've seen.
[01:25:54.176 --> 01:25:57.739]  Okay, what they do is just call me here at the State House.
[01:25:57.779 --> 01:25:57.999]  That's 573-751-0246.
[01:26:05.301 --> 01:26:13.478]  Or they can email me at jim.guest at house.mo, m-o dot gov.
[01:26:13.719 --> 01:26:15.222]  Thanks from Missouri House Government.
[01:26:15.905 --> 01:26:25.568]  And we will forward copies of our legislation to all over the country, to you, to your legislator, so they can start filing in those states who have not filed.
[01:26:25.588 --> 01:26:27.969]  That's how we're doing, sending model legislation around.
[01:26:28.569 --> 01:26:32.070]  And you can revamp it to fit your particular state, but you've got to get active.
[01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:40.593]  For those here in Missouri, give me a call, and I'll give you the name of some legislators that you need to work on to getting this voted out of the committee.
[01:26:40.633 --> 01:26:42.013]  It's very important to get this out.
[01:26:42.513 --> 01:26:52.658]  So our voice for freedom here gets heard in Missouri, so we're probably preaching to those who've probably heard this many times, but you can't say it too often, it's time to get involved.
[01:26:53.184 --> 01:26:55.985]  We're on a lot of AM and FM stations on the internet in Shoreway.
[01:26:56.005 --> 01:26:57.166]  We have a new list every millisecond.
[01:26:57.406 --> 01:27:00.507]  Pull back up on screen his website, his state website.
[01:27:00.807 --> 01:27:08.210]  He's got the number 573-751-0246 or just go get his bill or the New Hampshire bill or others.
[01:27:09.011 --> 01:27:12.972]  Go to your statehouse, go to the Texas Capitol, go say, introduce this.
[01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:19.255]  Bring the articles, mainstream news about FEMA camps and things and the gun confiscation bills they've got introduced in Congress.
[01:27:19.555 --> 01:27:21.036]  I mean this is really happening.
[01:27:21.616 --> 01:27:24.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the big solutions.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.584]  All we talk about is solutions here, and the enemy claims we're not.
[01:27:28.024 --> 01:27:33.311]  In closing, sir, I just want to commend you and the great spirit of Paul Revere and George Washington, what you're doing.
[01:27:33.952 --> 01:27:36.175]  And we appreciate you offering to have folks called.
[01:27:36.195 --> 01:27:38.678]  You can consult with them and try to help them with your state or other states.
[01:27:38.718 --> 01:27:40.280]  That's quite a burden you've just taken on.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:42.881]  But the other state reps we've had on have made the same offers.
[01:27:42.961 --> 01:27:44.322]  Great, great patriots.
[01:27:44.702 --> 01:27:47.303]  In closing, you heard my point about at least the show's on the road.
[01:27:47.343 --> 01:27:54.407]  At least it's so out in the open that I'm seeing a gigantic awakening, bigger than anything I'd ever seen before.
[01:27:54.867 --> 01:28:02.391]  So, are you seeing a huge firestorm of people starting to get upset and seeing what's happening?
[01:28:02.961 --> 01:28:03.862]  We are, absolutely.
[01:28:03.962 --> 01:28:17.432]  We can make a few calls, send out a few emails, and we can energize a lot of people, patriots around the state, to inundate their legislators with calls and emails on this, and I hope that continues to grow, because it has to be the voice of the people that makes a difference.
[01:28:17.872 --> 01:28:28.460]  And I've got six young students who just walked in my office here, and we're fighting for their freedom and their rights, and I'll be talking to them about this here when we get off the air, so that's who we're working and fighting for.
[01:28:29.602 --> 01:28:30.062]  Absolutely.
[01:28:30.082 --> 01:28:36.385]  I'll let you get to those young people, sir, and it's going to be folks like you and those young students that are going to save this republic for future generations.
[01:28:36.965 --> 01:28:40.367]  Our ancestors fought for us to have this much liberty.
[01:28:40.707 --> 01:28:44.629]  It's our job now to fight to retain any of what was gained in the past.
[01:28:44.909 --> 01:28:45.689]  God bless you.
[01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:47.230]  Representative Gass, take care.
[01:28:47.250 --> 01:28:48.051]  Okay.
[01:28:48.091 --> 01:28:48.611]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:49.096 --> 01:28:49.376]  You bet.
[01:28:49.416 --> 01:28:50.136]  What a great guy.
[01:28:50.557 --> 01:28:51.977]  Good to have him on with us.
[01:28:51.997 --> 01:28:53.137]  We're going to continue tomorrow.
[01:28:53.157 --> 01:28:54.658]  We've got two New Hampshire's.
[01:28:55.258 --> 01:28:55.898]  Or is it Friday?
[01:28:56.859 --> 01:28:58.799]  We've got a bunch of state reps coming on.
[01:28:58.819 --> 01:29:05.161]  That guy we had from Washington a couple days ago talking about, he knew about the FEMA camps, martial law.
[01:29:07.322 --> 01:29:09.823]  Yeah, State Rep Shea, Matt Shea.
[01:29:10.863 --> 01:29:15.285]  I mean, it's just a wonderful, he was fully informed, Army officer,
[01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:18.919]  Knows about the gun confiscation.
[01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:20.039]  Knows about the New World Order.
[01:29:20.379 --> 01:29:21.960]  Knows about PDD 51.
[01:29:22.781 --> 01:29:25.582]  And the enemy has just announced all this.
[01:29:25.622 --> 01:29:28.023]  Because they know the general dumbed-down public is scared.
[01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:30.304]  And it's going, give me a job, give me my paycheck.
[01:29:30.804 --> 01:29:33.266]  And Obama's like, oh, I'm going to save you.
[01:29:33.286 --> 01:29:34.606]  We have this video clip coming up.
[01:29:34.646 --> 01:29:35.887]  It is the sickest thing I've ever seen.
[01:29:36.227 --> 01:29:38.008]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers will be able to see it.
[01:29:38.388 --> 01:29:40.229]  Or folks at Rip It to the Four Winds on the web later.
[01:29:40.589 --> 01:29:42.250]  Live listeners will be able to hear the audio.
[01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:43.811]  Coming up, a final
[01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:49.124]  Twenty-seven minutes left when we get back, and we're going to take some phone calls and cover some other news.
[01:29:49.184 --> 01:29:52.685]  So, opening the phones right now, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:55.425 --> 01:29:57.106]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:30:00.847 --> 01:30:01.727]  We're on the march.
[01:30:02.227 --> 01:30:03.827]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:04.768 --> 01:30:07.528]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:14.770]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.429]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:26.653]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[01:30:27.073 --> 01:30:30.597]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[01:30:31.077 --> 01:30:38.204]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:30:38.644 --> 01:30:39.445]  Need something more?
[01:30:39.845 --> 01:30:43.449]  The Stinger keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[01:30:43.951 --> 01:30:52.075]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival spy and tactical gear.

[01:30:55.537 --> 01:31:00.099]  Visit mrdefense.com, that's mrdefense.com, or call 1-800-313-6400, 1-800-313-6400, that's 1-800-313-6400.
[01:31:10.916 --> 01:31:17.300]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.641]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:20.322 --> 01:31:21.342]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:21.863 --> 01:31:22.383]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:22.663 --> 01:31:23.584]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:25.025]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:25.045 --> 01:31:26.686]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:27.026 --> 01:31:33.770]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:34.170 --> 01:31:34.610]  Some U.S.
[01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:40.314]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:40.994 --> 01:31:44.515]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:54.738]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:54.978 --> 01:31:55.718]  Fabled enemies.
[01:31:56.198 --> 01:32:03.480]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:07.301]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:10.839 --> 01:32:13.861]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:32:14.301 --> 01:32:17.584]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:32:18.084 --> 01:32:24.028]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:32:24.388 --> 01:32:28.531]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:32:29.031 --> 01:32:34.755]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:32:35.055 --> 01:32:38.037]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:32:40.819 --> 01:32:41.359]  Let's go!
[01:33:23.904 --> 01:33:48.352]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole
[01:33:50.561 --> 01:34:09.419]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[01:34:12.662 --> 01:34:14.644]  My sweetest friend
[01:34:17.445 --> 01:34:26.817]  Everyone I know goes away in the end.
[01:34:27.638 --> 01:34:35.708]  And you could have it all, my empire of dirt.
[01:34:47.406 --> 01:34:49.069]  Obama's gonna make you hurt.
[01:34:49.089 --> 01:34:51.152]  He's here to betray you.
[01:34:52.113 --> 01:34:52.974]  Very, very wicked.
[01:34:55.218 --> 01:34:58.362]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:03.436]  Where Barack Obama has these people.
[01:35:03.476 --> 01:35:05.436]  Now first he tells them he's going to fix everything.
[01:35:05.817 --> 01:35:10.158]  As soon as he gets in, the war is going to end, the torture is going to end, the lobbyists are going to end.
[01:35:10.178 --> 01:35:11.439]  He lied about all of that.
[01:35:11.479 --> 01:35:18.141]  Now it's 16 months, 24 months in Iraq, beefing up troops, expanding troops in the Middle East and Central Asia.
[01:35:19.521 --> 01:35:26.804]  Rahm Emanuel saying they want to nuke Iran, his chief of staff, who's an open foreign intelligence officer of another country.
[01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:28.684]  All of this is happening.
[01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:38.094]  He shifts from hope and change to, we're not going to have a crisis, we're going to have a catastrophe, do whatever I say, let the foreign banks completely take over.
[01:35:38.734 --> 01:35:40.716]  Now, this is all over the news.
[01:35:41.196 --> 01:35:43.618]  Every time you watch Obama in one of these town halls, this is all that happens.
[01:35:43.638 --> 01:35:51.403]  These poor, good people, being led by this Judas Code, who's bringing in total tyranny, FEMA camps, everything happening.
[01:35:52.324 --> 01:35:54.205]  National drafts, everything being announced.
[01:35:55.725 --> 01:35:58.267]  And they're trying to coat this evil with this Obama-mania.
[01:35:58.827 --> 01:36:00.328]  This is such a corporate fraud.
[01:36:00.608 --> 01:36:02.290]  Let's go ahead and play this saddening clip.
[01:36:04.051 --> 01:36:06.753]  This young lady's been waiting very patiently.
[01:36:07.193 --> 01:36:10.735]  And she's just been standing there and making me look all guilty.
[01:36:13.157 --> 01:36:16.419]  So, go ahead.
[01:36:16.459 --> 01:36:18.040]  Here, you've got the microphone right behind you.
[01:36:18.841 --> 01:36:19.662]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:19.742 --> 01:36:21.283]  I first want to say... Hit pause.
[01:36:22.819 --> 01:36:23.219]  Back it up.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:31.127]  Watching his body language, I don't think Obama, he's evil, he's proud, he's into power, but you really watch him.
[01:36:31.147 --> 01:36:34.610]  He had that Freudian slip the other day where he said, you know, we've got to get money out of the banks, I mean the people.
[01:36:35.371 --> 01:36:42.698]  You can see all this woman over here, she's making me feel guilty and you can see him, he's not even acting, he is feeling guilty.
[01:36:45.031 --> 01:36:47.752]  Because he's basically slitting this woman's throat for the New World Order.
[01:36:48.232 --> 01:36:49.513]  And he's doing it while like a little dog.
[01:36:49.533 --> 01:36:53.274]  It's like your dog looking up at you, and you take a gun, and it's smiling at you.
[01:36:53.454 --> 01:37:00.016]  It's licking, you know, it's licking its lips for that one dinner, and you just... That's basically what he's doing to this poor lady.
[01:37:00.036 --> 01:37:01.377]  Like it's a, like it's a little dog.
[01:37:01.437 --> 01:37:03.457]  Just, just a poor little trusting person.
[01:37:04.198 --> 01:37:05.178]  Go ahead and go back to it.
[01:37:05.978 --> 01:37:07.499]  Here, you've got the microphone right behind you.
[01:37:08.339 --> 01:37:09.159]  Thank you very much.
[01:37:09.239 --> 01:37:13.481]  I first want to say, uh, I respect you and I'm just so grateful for you.
[01:37:13.721 --> 01:37:14.021]  Thank you.
[01:37:14.426 --> 01:37:16.467]  I believe in prayers.
[01:37:16.487 --> 01:37:17.347]  I appreciate that.
[01:37:17.547 --> 01:37:21.328]  I have an urgent need.
[01:37:21.609 --> 01:37:23.169]  Unemployment and homelessness.
[01:37:23.329 --> 01:37:26.010]  A very small vehicle for my family and I to live in.
[01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:27.771]  We need urgent.
[01:37:28.291 --> 01:37:31.152]  And our housing authorities have two years waiting lists.
[01:37:32.572 --> 01:37:35.873]  We need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to.
[01:37:36.354 --> 01:37:38.814]  We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom.
[01:37:39.815 --> 01:37:40.315]  Please help.
[01:37:41.295 --> 01:37:43.056]  Well, listen, what's your name?
[01:37:44.528 --> 01:37:45.068]  What's your name?
[01:37:45.509 --> 01:37:46.950]  It's Henrietta Hughes.
[01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:47.630]  Okay, Ms.
[01:37:47.670 --> 01:37:48.131]  Hughes.
[01:37:48.191 --> 01:37:59.079]  Well, we're going to do everything we can to help you, but there are a lot of people like you, and we're going to do everything we can.
[01:37:59.219 --> 01:37:59.479]  All right?
[01:37:59.499 --> 01:38:01.780]  I'll have my staff talk to you after the time-out.
[01:38:01.861 --> 01:38:02.921]  All right?
[01:38:04.983 --> 01:38:06.624]  All right.
[01:38:07.625 --> 01:38:09.447]  And then it cuts to, and we're playing another clip.
[01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:11.088]  Alright, what's the question?
[01:38:27.871 --> 01:38:34.956]  And, okay, I've been at the same job, which is McDonald's, for four and a half years because of the fact that I can't find another job.
[01:38:35.336 --> 01:38:47.123]  Now, with the fact that I've been there for as long as I've been there, do you have any plan or any idea of making one that has been there for a long time receive any better benefits than what they've already received?
[01:38:47.504 --> 01:38:48.384]  Well, I tell you what.
[01:38:48.944 --> 01:38:51.426]  First of all, a couple things I'd like to say.
[01:38:52.187 --> 01:38:52.727]  Number one,
[01:38:53.812 --> 01:39:06.941]  The fact that you are working, as hard as you're working, at a job that I know doesn't always pay as well as some other jobs, I think that's a source of pride for you, that shows that you're doing the right thing.
[01:39:10.784 --> 01:39:20.611]  Now, the second thing is, is that you will actually benefit from the tax breaks that we're talking about, so you'll be able to keep a little bit of extra money, because we're going to offset your payroll tax.
[01:39:21.031 --> 01:39:21.612]  That's going to help.
[01:39:23.155 --> 01:39:28.637]  Oh, I don't, I assume that you're not getting health care through your job.
[01:39:29.457 --> 01:39:36.659]  And so one of the things that we want to do is reform the health care system so that you will have access to health care in your class.
[01:39:37.579 --> 01:39:41.520]  In the subsection, that old lady he was just talking to, she won't get health care.
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:45.721]  I read the quotes Bloomberg yesterday of the people pushing the bill and what's in there.
[01:39:46.261 --> 01:39:48.942]  It says, well, if you're going blind and you're old, you're going to have to just go blind.
[01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:49.882]  That's what's supposed to happen.
[01:39:50.302 --> 01:39:51.663]  Only the young people get health care.
[01:39:52.833 --> 01:39:55.735]  And what they're doing is playing the young off against the old as if everybody couldn't have it.
[01:39:56.676 --> 01:39:57.917]  The bankers weren't stealing everything.
[01:39:58.798 --> 01:39:59.819]  And they're taking over health care.
[01:40:00.139 --> 01:40:03.162]  So you got this guy, oh, just I'm begging you, oh Lord, like he's God.
[01:40:03.702 --> 01:40:04.483]  Oh, save me.
[01:40:04.503 --> 01:40:11.408]  I mean, just they have put their total faith in this guy and we know he's betraying them with the international banks.
[01:40:11.428 --> 01:40:16.072]  We know they're openly setting up a global bank to tax the industry that's left and the companies that are left.
[01:40:16.352 --> 01:40:18.975]  We know he said get ready for austerity, get ready for tough times.
[01:40:18.995 --> 01:40:21.477]  He told that old lady, there's a lot of people in your position, ma'am.
[01:40:22.895 --> 01:40:23.795]  She's basically homeless.
[01:40:23.815 --> 01:40:24.095]  You heard her.
[01:40:24.115 --> 01:40:25.316]  I don't even have a bathroom or a kitchen.
[01:40:26.016 --> 01:40:29.277]  And it's gonna get worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.
[01:40:29.917 --> 01:40:30.637]  Let's go back to it.
[01:40:31.497 --> 01:40:33.218]  Of course, now it better be a good one.
[01:40:35.498 --> 01:40:35.838]  Go ahead.
[01:40:36.739 --> 01:40:38.839]  Oh, it's such a blessing to see you, Mr. President.
[01:40:38.879 --> 01:40:40.520]  Thank you for taking time out of your day!
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:41.560]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:43.360]  Oh, gracious God, thank you so much.
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:44.981]  Or you can cut up to the end if you want.
[01:40:45.501 --> 01:40:45.881]  It's just...
[01:40:49.918 --> 01:40:50.639]  It's just horrible.
[01:40:50.659 --> 01:40:53.001]  It's absolutely horrific to see this happening.
[01:40:53.541 --> 01:40:54.642]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:40:55.242 --> 01:40:57.504]  Let's talk to John in Ohio first, because he disagrees.
[01:40:57.584 --> 01:40:58.685]  Okay, John, you're up first.
[01:40:59.826 --> 01:41:02.328]  Yeah, you know, I always have to tell you where I'm coming from.
[01:41:02.348 --> 01:41:17.721]  You know, I've publicized your videos on national radio, and I support, and I'm usually inspired by what you say, but on other occasions, horrified, and I think in some ways you're very contradictory
[01:41:18.756 --> 01:41:30.061]  In terms of believing the most extreme fascist elements of the military-industrial complex propaganda concerning communism and socialism.
[01:41:30.142 --> 01:41:32.583]  I know you know better, because sometimes you ambivalent.
[01:41:33.103 --> 01:41:39.266]  And the Newsweek claiming that this is socialism when they know it's exactly the opposite of socialism.
[01:41:39.326 --> 01:41:41.407]  It's the marriage of the government... John, stop!
[01:41:41.427 --> 01:41:41.507]  Stop!
[01:41:41.567 --> 01:41:43.668]  I'm gonna let you talk, but I want you to stop.
[01:41:45.373 --> 01:41:49.316]  There is no socialism, there is no communism, there is no fascism.
[01:41:49.596 --> 01:41:57.423]  There's tyranny that always comes through big government because corrupt people will get control of it and use it to rob from people, because men aren't angels.
[01:41:58.143 --> 01:41:58.844]  And there's liberty.
[01:41:59.184 --> 01:42:02.587]  Now we can debate what will bring liberty, but it's decentralization, local control.
[01:42:04.930 --> 01:42:06.271]  Of course, stop, stop.
[01:42:06.352 --> 01:42:12.638]  Of course I said the Newsweek headline where the red states and the blue states are shaking hands and it says we're all socialists now.
[01:42:13.679 --> 01:42:15.681]  Of course this isn't socialism.
[01:42:17.202 --> 01:42:21.324]  And of course this isn't true capitalism with these foreign offshore banks stealing and robbing.
[01:42:21.344 --> 01:42:22.024]  This is looting.
[01:42:22.305 --> 01:42:23.285]  This is piracy.
[01:42:23.885 --> 01:42:32.790]  And so they're going to give literally about 2% of the money to the poor people while taking their jobs and making them dependent and give 98% to the foreign banks.
[01:42:33.230 --> 01:42:34.511]  So it's not socialism.
[01:42:34.611 --> 01:42:35.792]  You're right about that.
[01:42:36.852 --> 01:42:39.653]  But what we have is also not what you call capitalism.
[01:42:39.994 --> 01:42:41.715]  This is crony capitalism.
[01:42:41.815 --> 01:42:44.276]  Robbing, stealing, whatever you want to call it.
[01:42:45.967 --> 01:42:50.068]  So you're saying that I'm putting out right-wing fascist information.
[01:42:51.089 --> 01:42:52.669]  Notice that both parties do the same thing.
[01:42:52.909 --> 01:42:53.309]  You know what?
[01:42:53.769 --> 01:42:56.550]  You just don't get it, sir, because you believe the left-right paradigm.
[01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.790]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:58.331]  I'll shut up.
[01:42:58.951 --> 01:42:59.731]  I don't believe that.
[01:42:59.791 --> 01:43:05.252]  You know, even before you were criticizing Obama for being a fascist, I was doing it.
[01:43:05.673 --> 01:43:10.054]  So I'm not in that Democrat-Republican paradigm.
[01:43:10.114 --> 01:43:13.915]  It's right-wing, disguised right-wing, and undisguised right-wing.
[01:43:13.975 --> 01:43:14.755]  It's not left-right.
[01:43:15.502 --> 01:43:43.356]  And some of the people that I've heard you on today, now, you know, Jack McClam says some important things about the war and Tillman and the rest of it, but he comes out and he says that these people are communists, that anyone who's in the elite, who have been involved in some of the most anti-Soviet, anti-communist operations,
[01:43:43.789 --> 01:43:46.751]  That is going to discredit, I think, much of the wonderful things you're doing.
[01:43:46.831 --> 01:43:50.172]  I think some of the people in Hollywood are fearful.
[01:43:50.693 --> 01:43:57.116]  Others may be embarrassed, like Jesse Ventura, for instance, when you had this man from Glenn Spence.
[01:43:57.876 --> 01:44:04.180]  I believe that many of these people are absolutely neocons in their attitude towards war and the rest of it.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.240]  I've heard many of them.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:08.642]  They are total supporters of neoconism.
[01:44:09.042 --> 01:44:12.124]  Larry Flatt, he says very good things about keeping your gun rights.
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:19.945]  At the same time, he made the comment that he supports the paramilitary death squads in Guatemala that kill over a million people.
[01:44:19.985 --> 01:44:20.665]  Let me stop you.
[01:44:20.705 --> 01:44:21.346]  Let me stop you.
[01:44:22.766 --> 01:44:26.589]  We are very proud of the Second Amendment issue because it's the only real gun lobby we got, sir.
[01:44:27.129 --> 01:44:32.172]  You know, you can't judge me by everything my guests have said or done, but let's just expand on here.
[01:44:35.097 --> 01:44:37.258]  Did the Soviets allow citizens to own guns?
[01:44:37.358 --> 01:44:39.419]  Did the communist Chinese allow them to own guns?
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:43.121]  Look at the fruits of what you call communism.
[01:44:43.862 --> 01:44:46.583]  Now, if we had a bunch of angels running things, could communism work?
[01:44:47.424 --> 01:44:49.285]  No, because that's not how humans operate.
[01:44:49.505 --> 01:44:51.686]  We want to be different.
[01:44:51.706 --> 01:44:54.347]  We want to identify as different people.
[01:44:54.768 --> 01:44:56.749]  Look, it's a philosophical divide.
[01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:58.390]  I'm against torture.
[01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:59.290]  I'm against more wars.
[01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:00.171]  I'm against drafts.
[01:45:01.391 --> 01:45:02.512]  I'm against police state.
[01:45:02.912 --> 01:45:04.013]  I'm against federal control.
[01:45:05.242 --> 01:45:07.683]  You get rid of those, the New World Order falls apart.
[01:45:07.703 --> 01:45:12.864]  You know, see, I'm not a fan of Fidel Castro.
[01:45:12.904 --> 01:45:14.985]  I'm not a fan of Barack Obama or George W. Bush.
[01:45:15.565 --> 01:45:18.686]  I understand that it's not Iran good, U.S.
[01:45:18.726 --> 01:45:22.707]  bad, U.S., you know, good, Iran bad.
[01:45:23.127 --> 01:45:25.348]  It's that it's the nature of man and corruption.
[01:45:25.388 --> 01:45:26.468]  Now, who's the big empire?
[01:45:26.768 --> 01:45:27.448]  The New World Order.
[01:45:27.648 --> 01:45:28.389]  Who are we facing?
[01:45:28.409 --> 01:45:29.089]  The New World Order.
[01:45:30.069 --> 01:45:32.370]  Look, I'll give you one more minute and I've got to get to the other callers.
[01:45:32.410 --> 01:45:32.650]  Go ahead.
[01:45:33.194 --> 01:45:45.818]  Well, it seems like three or four times a day you've got to bring up, and I'm not a particular brief for the deformed version of communism in the Soviet Union or China.
[01:45:46.178 --> 01:45:53.361]  I don't believe they had real communism, but I believe we're subjected to massive lies, massive exaggerations about what happened there.
[01:45:53.461 --> 01:45:56.802]  If you'll check on Google, lies concerning the Soviet Union,
[01:45:57.168 --> 01:46:08.191]  You'll find that many of these things that we believe about the carnage and the rest of it, the numbers of people killed, were concocted by Nazis, Nazis, Goebbels.
[01:46:09.852 --> 01:46:12.893]  China says Mao killed 80 million people.
[01:46:13.213 --> 01:46:14.773]  The official numbers in the West are 60.
[01:46:15.474 --> 01:46:17.814]  Are you saying that didn't happen under Mao?
[01:46:17.854 --> 01:46:24.036]  You know, the mortal enemies of the new regime in China and Russia were the mortal enemies of the former regime.
[01:46:24.076 --> 01:46:26.677]  They will say anything because they actually
[01:46:27.305 --> 01:46:34.708]  For instance, Yeltsin actually bought tanks and troops up and killed the old guard in their own doom of parliament, the elected people.
[01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:41.371]  So to believe the new regime, which was the mortal enemy of the former regime, is not any kind of... Let me ask you this.
[01:46:41.411 --> 01:46:42.492]  What's your view of Putin?
[01:46:43.712 --> 01:46:48.615]  Putin is... I believe he's a nationalist.
[01:46:48.715 --> 01:46:51.316]  He's tried to reverse some of the
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:54.361]  A total stooging for the U.S.
[01:46:54.662 --> 01:46:57.603]  military-industrial complex under Yeltsin.
[01:46:58.064 --> 01:47:01.406]  But he has his own abuses, of course he does.
[01:47:01.466 --> 01:47:12.452]  But at the same time, he's resisting, I think, some of the policies of the United States military-industrial complex, which I think is good to that limited extent.
[01:47:12.672 --> 01:47:13.753]  That's what I believe about him.
[01:47:14.093 --> 01:47:14.733]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:16.834 --> 01:47:19.856]  Let's go ahead and who's up next here?
[01:47:19.896 --> 01:47:21.097]  My call list just refreshed.
[01:47:22.458 --> 01:47:23.959]  Elliot in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:47:23.979 --> 01:47:26.501]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:47:27.002 --> 01:47:27.242]  Good.
[01:47:29.003 --> 01:47:33.487]  Um, so uh, I got a question and then I got an idea for a solution.
[01:47:33.967 --> 01:47:44.455]  Uh, my question is, let's just say everything like uh, let's just say it is the worst case scenario, everything crashes, and Mad Max scenario happens.
[01:47:45.016 --> 01:47:46.757]  What's, what in your opinion,
[01:47:47.352 --> 01:47:48.695]  Do we do as patriots?
[01:47:48.856 --> 01:47:55.330]  If we are prepared, we've got the guns, the gold, the water, the atmospheric water generators, and all the food and all that.
[01:47:56.212 --> 01:47:57.475]  Where do we start from there?
[01:47:58.231 --> 01:48:03.435]  Well, first we have to wait while they let everything break down, so then people beg for total tyranny.
[01:48:03.595 --> 01:48:09.340]  They plan to let it all fall apart, it looks like they're going to do this, so then after six months a year they come in and people are begging for it.
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:26.094]  You have to be waiting for that next phase to not be re-educated, to not go to the FEMA camp, to not go along with them, and if enough people say no, to whatever extent, whatever means necessary, then the whole thing will fail and then we can reorganize at the state level and then reconvene the republic.
[01:48:27.737 --> 01:48:38.925]  You know, we need organizations now at the state level, led by state representatives and others, who talk openly about the New World Order, who say they're bankrupting things by design, and that the states need to organize now against the globalists.
[01:48:38.945 --> 01:48:43.428]  That message has to go out now, and then the globalists may stop imploding the economy.
[01:48:43.448 --> 01:48:44.388]  They could stop it right now.
[01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:47.570]  They've destroyed commerce, they could say everything was fine, everything would be fine.
[01:48:47.911 --> 01:48:48.711]  Because it's fiat.
[01:48:49.852 --> 01:48:55.396]  So, we have to explain to people that A, the globalists are doing this by design, to bring in world government, which they admit they're doing now, no more debating it.
[01:48:56.101 --> 01:48:56.621]  Right, okay.
[01:48:56.701 --> 01:49:02.563]  So my solution is, like, I'm in college right now at the University of Cincinnati, and for all of you out in college, you know, in college that are listening to this show,
[01:49:21.266 --> 01:49:24.548]  I'm pretty sure every college usually has a newspaper.
[01:49:24.648 --> 01:49:33.452]  Try to get in on the newspaper or send in an article to the newspaper so the journalists can disseminate that info out to the entire college.
[01:49:33.472 --> 01:49:34.432]  Or don't count on them.
[01:49:34.512 --> 01:49:36.653]  Start your own online student newspaper.
[01:49:36.994 --> 01:49:38.994]  Get a few writers and pass flyers out.
[01:49:39.215 --> 01:49:41.336]  You'll have more visits in the school newspaper in a week.
[01:49:42.356 --> 01:49:43.477]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:49:43.857 --> 01:49:45.338]  And I'm not taking a lot of my friends.
[01:49:45.358 --> 01:49:47.218]  A lot of my friends, I've been talking to them for years.
[01:49:47.238 --> 01:49:48.339]  They're finally waking up.
[01:49:48.809 --> 01:49:49.630]  And they're loving it.
[01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:51.351]  They've taken back their sovereignty.
[01:49:51.411 --> 01:49:55.693]  I've already got like about five guys coming to me next week when we go to City Hall.
[01:49:56.194 --> 01:49:57.735]  We're going to go to the council.
[01:49:57.755 --> 01:49:59.296]  We're going to present this legislation.
[01:49:59.396 --> 01:49:59.936]  Exactly.
[01:49:59.976 --> 01:50:02.278]  Don't go get drunk at the bar and chase women.
[01:50:03.078 --> 01:50:11.764]  Go get the smart women out there and have them join you and go down to the city council and speak about these issues and read executive orders to them and just create such a buzz everywhere.
[01:50:11.804 --> 01:50:12.824]  You'll be truly alive.
[01:50:12.844 --> 01:50:13.525]  Good to hear from you.
[01:50:14.855 --> 01:50:17.417]  We're going to come back and take some calls in the final segment.
[01:50:17.757 --> 01:50:24.681]  I did want to tell listeners out there about some of our great sponsors like SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:50:25.142 --> 01:50:26.683]  One word, SurvivalistSeeds.com.

[01:54:39.022 --> 01:54:42.007]  I watch, see them, and call them all suckers.
[01:54:42.668 --> 01:54:44.630]  They warning me about Osama over there.
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:51.122]  Alright, final segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:51.722 --> 01:54:53.443]  Let's jam in some more of these phone calls.
[01:54:54.084 --> 01:54:54.604]  Oh, wait a minute!
[01:54:54.624 --> 01:54:57.826]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Canada.
[01:54:57.846 --> 01:54:59.027]  You're on the air, welcome.
[01:54:59.067 --> 01:54:59.787]  How are you, Alex?
[01:54:59.807 --> 01:55:01.809]  Good, we're fighting devil state mind control.
[01:55:15.774 --> 01:55:16.614]  No doubt, no doubt.
[01:55:16.654 --> 01:55:17.475]  Is it your birthday today?
[01:55:17.515 --> 01:55:18.155]  Happy birthday.
[01:55:18.515 --> 01:55:19.035]  Sure is.
[01:55:19.055 --> 01:55:19.996]  Thank you.
[01:55:20.016 --> 01:55:20.596]  Right on, right on.
[01:55:20.616 --> 01:55:22.737]  A couple questions for you and a few statements.
[01:55:23.057 --> 01:55:28.759]  Alex, I just want to commend you on the work that you're doing, not only for the United States, but also up here in Canada.
[01:55:28.899 --> 01:55:34.921]  I mean, like, this is something that's not only limited to the United States, it's limited to Canada as well.
[01:55:35.181 --> 01:55:36.942]  We're tied in a lot of ways, that's for sure.
[01:55:37.512 --> 01:55:45.375]  A lot of things that you have mentioned, you know, like on your films, even with your black helicopters, for example, that's happening up here in Calgary, Alberta.
[01:55:45.736 --> 01:55:48.437]  That's all to condition you for military occupation.
[01:55:49.017 --> 01:55:49.877]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:55:49.937 --> 01:55:50.978]  There's no question about it.
[01:55:51.118 --> 01:55:52.618]  The deals are signed to use U.S.
[01:55:52.658 --> 01:55:54.759]  troops in Canada and Canadian troops here.
[01:55:54.799 --> 01:55:55.900]  It's in your mainstream news now.
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:58.221]  A couple questions, Alex.
[01:55:58.261 --> 01:56:00.202]  Do you know of any affiliates up in Canada?
[01:56:00.222 --> 01:56:03.724]  No AM or FM's in Canada.
[01:56:04.124 --> 01:56:05.085]  It'd be great to get some.
[01:56:05.145 --> 01:56:06.145]  Call local stations.
[01:56:06.546 --> 01:56:07.766]  I got from Mom and Pop's.
[01:56:08.247 --> 01:56:09.748]  The corporate owners won't put us on.
[01:56:10.288 --> 01:56:11.329]  And get them to put us on up there.
[01:56:11.349 --> 01:56:11.869]  That's up to you.
[01:56:12.909 --> 01:56:14.991]  Well, that's for sure.
[01:56:15.411 --> 01:56:24.516]  We need a lot more support in Canada because you mentioned a couple weeks ago that Canadians are very nice people and they have absolutely no idea about the control that they're under.
[01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:29.633]  Since that statement, I went and I read the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada.
[01:56:30.154 --> 01:56:31.435]  And then I went and I re-read the U.S.
[01:56:31.475 --> 01:56:32.116]  Constitution.
[01:56:32.917 --> 01:56:40.024]  And I'll tell you right now, at any point in time, I would give up my Canadian citizenship to become an American for the Constitution.
[01:56:48.021 --> 01:56:50.042]  Tyranny is on the march, so is liberty.
[01:56:50.162 --> 01:56:51.463]  That is the bottom line.
[01:56:51.483 --> 01:56:54.105]  And I have Canadians emailing me saying, it's not as bad as you say here.
[01:56:54.245 --> 01:56:56.607]  Baloney, it's bad everywhere.
[01:56:56.707 --> 01:56:58.828]  Tyler in Texas, last caller we have time for.
[01:56:58.888 --> 01:57:00.029]  Sorry Rob, Greg and others.
[01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:00.629]  Go ahead Tyler.
[01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:02.050]  Alex, happy birthday.
[01:57:02.611 --> 01:57:03.031]  Thank you sir.
[01:57:03.051 --> 01:57:05.433]  Alright, I've got a couple things to say.
[01:57:05.753 --> 01:57:09.015]  As far as those clips you played earlier of Obama giving that kiss to the homeless lady.
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:11.541]  Yeah, I thought that was ridiculous when I saw that live.
[01:57:11.601 --> 01:57:18.025]  He doesn't even take care of his own family, his own aunts, that live in squalor, and his own half-brothers.
[01:57:18.546 --> 01:57:19.646]  That is degenerate.
[01:57:20.447 --> 01:57:21.487]  And then, one more thing.
[01:57:21.628 --> 01:57:25.390]  Yeah, I know you were saying clergy being used in times of martial law, and stuff like that.
[01:57:26.190 --> 01:57:31.574]  There's a church up the street, on a big message board, like, you know, on the side of the road, that thousands of people see every day.
[01:57:31.594 --> 01:57:35.016]  In big letters, it says, you have the right to submit.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.121]  It's like, couldn't believe it.
[01:57:37.722 --> 01:57:43.146]  They're being paid by FEMA, at least 26,000 of them now on record, to teach them.
[01:57:43.226 --> 01:57:49.790]  And if you went to the sermons, you look on the sermon list, it'll say a few weeks what's coming up, and you need to go and even record it.
[01:57:50.211 --> 01:57:53.573]  And they'll say, it's good to turn your guns in, it's of the Lord!
[01:57:54.014 --> 01:57:55.815]  I mean, that's how creepy this is.
[01:57:56.495 --> 01:57:58.817]  The government's not paying to have them say that for nothing.
[01:58:01.952 --> 01:58:02.853]  Yeah, outstanding.
[01:58:02.873 --> 01:58:03.333]  I don't know.
[01:58:03.533 --> 01:58:04.593]  What's the name of the church?
[01:58:05.574 --> 01:58:07.295]  Uh, I'm in Austin, by the way.
[01:58:07.315 --> 01:58:08.656]  It's off Bee Cave.
[01:58:08.676 --> 01:58:09.656]  I think it's Lake Hills.
[01:58:10.677 --> 01:58:11.837]  Off Bee Cave in Cuernavaca.
[01:58:12.298 --> 01:58:18.961]  Why don't you take a photo of it, email it to Aaron with two A's at InfoWars.com, Joey V at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:18.981 --> 01:58:19.521]  We'll post it.
[01:58:19.781 --> 01:58:20.582]  We need your help.
[01:58:20.602 --> 01:58:22.403]  We're going to try to create sections.
[01:58:22.703 --> 01:58:23.624]  The Prison Planet Forum.
[01:58:23.684 --> 01:58:24.264]  Post it there.
[01:58:25.084 --> 01:58:25.384]  Okay?
[01:58:27.426 --> 01:58:28.106]  I appreciate it.
[01:58:28.166 --> 01:58:29.867]  We need your help with the InfoWars.
[01:58:31.141 --> 01:58:32.681]  We had a bunch of guests on today.
[01:58:32.701 --> 01:58:34.702]  It was just absolutely jam-packed.
[01:58:35.022 --> 01:58:40.083]  I don't have time to tell you all the guests that were on, but it was Jack McClam, Sheriff Richard Mack, State Rep.
[01:58:40.263 --> 01:58:42.303]  George Humphrey popped in there in the first hour.
[01:58:42.323 --> 01:58:43.183]  That's coming up right now.
[01:58:43.523 --> 01:58:45.604]  Key Transmission restarts right now.
[01:58:45.704 --> 01:58:48.824]  OnePlace, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com on our sites.
[01:58:48.844 --> 01:58:49.324]  The OnePlace.
[01:58:49.564 --> 01:58:50.044]  God bless you.
[01:58:52.125 --> 01:58:53.985]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:55.646 --> 01:58:56.786]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:00.694 --> 01:59:02.235]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:59:02.375 --> 01:59:07.037]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:07.117 --> 01:59:09.858]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:10.078 --> 01:59:12.939]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:13.119 --> 01:59:17.841]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:18.021 --> 01:59:18.221]  Come on!
[01:59:37.836 --> 01:59:43.921]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
