[00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:09.805]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:00:09.805 --> 00:00:11.386]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.327]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.327 --> 00:00:17.128]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:24.512]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:25.592]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.253]  Welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:32.137]  We have a very informative and important guest on today.
[00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:42.863]  Our guest for February 11, 2009, our officer Jack McClam to cover the latest New World Order police state developments.
[00:00:42.863 --> 00:00:51.929]  Then we have Glenn Spencer of American Patrol with the fact that Mexico is literally collapsing into crime and murder.
[00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.392]  That, according to the United States State Department.
[00:00:56.392 --> 00:00:58.215]  We're going to cover that in a moment.
[00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:03.041]  Also, Sheriff Richard Mack will be joining us to talk about the Second Amendment and a lot more.
[00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:06.185]  He took the Second Amendment case to the Supreme Court.
[00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:08.443]  And one on the Tenth Amendment.
[00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:09.744]  He'll be popping in.
[00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:18.912]  And then Representative Jim Guest of Missouri, they've introduced legislation in Missouri along with ten other states to say no martial law, no FEMA camps.
[00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:25.718]  All this week and next week we're going to have state reps on from now the ten different states that are moving for sovereignty.
[00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:43.828]  And the Homeland Security operation, the NORTHCOM system, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, and PDD 51 empowered system claiming governors have no authority now, and that we're under War Powers Act and martial law, that is all designed and built around usurping the states.
[00:01:43.828 --> 00:01:48.811]  They know that our best chance of defeating them politically, non-violently,
[00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:53.734]  is taking control of the states through the legislative process and saying no.
[00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:54.595]  We must do this.
[00:01:54.595 --> 00:02:01.600]  Washington is fully owned subsidiary of offshore banks carrying out criminal operations against the Republic.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.441]  The military has been seized.
[00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:08.745]  Same thing with Hitler seizing the military or Lenin seizing the military or Mao seizing the military.
[00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:10.547]  It is the exact same thing.
[00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:11.888]  It has happened here.
[00:02:11.888 --> 00:02:17.732]  So all those that love their country and love the Republic and the Bill of Rights and Constitution, now is the time to get your head out of the sand
[00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:19.252]  And start taking action.
[00:02:19.252 --> 00:02:22.253]  So, that is coming up today.
[00:02:22.253 --> 00:02:30.334]  Officer Jack McClam, Officer Sheriff Richard Mack, Representative Jim Guest, and Glenn Spencer as well today.
[00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:33.375]  And we'll even take some calls with each of those guests as well.
[00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:39.916]  Okay, headline up on PrisonPlanet.com, and of course we'll tie this in to all the other reports.
[00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:43.997]  Internment camps readied for mass illegal alien influx.
[00:02:45.478 --> 00:02:54.800]  This, of course, is referring to an article this morning that is in the El Paso newspaper.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:08.064]  And the El Paso newspaper is reporting this, so we'll be going over that coming up after this first break.
[00:03:10.578 --> 00:03:13.463]  I had the El Paso story here in my, oh here it is.
[00:03:13.463 --> 00:03:16.808]  Texas Crafts Plan for Mexico Collapse.
[00:03:16.808 --> 00:03:18.370]  This is out of the El Paso Times.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.884]  And Time Magazine has come out and called for a world government run by a new super world bank.
[00:03:27.884 --> 00:03:30.645]  I'm going to read the actual quote there.
[00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:34.087]  A month ago Newsweek had basically an identical article.
[00:03:34.087 --> 00:03:37.369]  Newsweek this week of course says we're all socialists now.
[00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:41.511]  No, we're all slaves of the bankers now until we wake up and say it's illegitimate.
[00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:45.834]  And they're the very ones that ran this whole heist, this whole swindle job.
[00:03:48.226 --> 00:03:52.931]  And until we wake up and understand the government's not here to help us, it's here to rob us, it's only going to get worse.
[00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.153]  So we'll go over that.
[00:03:55.153 --> 00:03:58.536]  And I want to ask Rush Limbaugh, I want to ask the ADL, I want to ask...
[00:03:59.557 --> 00:04:00.178]  The Congress.
[00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:02.459]  I want to ask the different federal agencies.
[00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:21.294]  You put out all these memos and training manuals saying we're schizophrenic terrorists, that we said that there was a world government being set up by offshore banks, because all their own documents said it, and you are still teaching and still showing on TV shows like 24 and others, not just in your own training manuals, but in popular culture, that we're insane.
[00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:21.514]  Why?
[00:04:21.514 --> 00:04:22.755]  Because we read the newspaper now?
[00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:26.218]  You know, before we read the documents and leaked documents and things and
[00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:27.985]  We're good to go.
[00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.012]  So I rebuke all of you in the media and the government that have made fun of us.
[00:04:48.012 --> 00:04:49.913]  You're going to end up losing everything you've got too.
[00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:54.395]  So it's time to pull out of the team you're on and join us.
[00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:55.016]  Period.
[00:04:55.016 --> 00:04:56.636]  Choose which side you're on.
[00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:59.278]  You know, your heart tells you to join the Republic.
[00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:04.359]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:08.622]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:05:08.622 --> 00:05:16.569]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:17.289]  We're good to go!
[00:05:49.844 --> 00:05:55.526]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:59.028]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:02.689]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.451]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:10.752]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.752 --> 00:06:13.633]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:17.274]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.809]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:37.068]  How dare you?
[00:06:37.068 --> 00:06:43.112]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.112 --> 00:06:45.734]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:45.734 --> 00:06:52.459]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:06:57.562 --> 00:07:03.626]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:07:03.626 --> 00:07:04.587]  Welcome to America.
[00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:06.651]  It's time for change.
[00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:09.472]  The new president is talking about change.
[00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:11.952]  Are you talking about change?
[00:07:11.952 --> 00:07:15.133]  You know, changing your lifestyle to become more healthy?
[00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:18.013]  Well, here's how the staff at LifeChangeT feels.
[00:07:18.013 --> 00:07:24.514]  Make the change to be healthy before your body forces you to change.
[00:07:24.514 --> 00:07:30.796]  Organ failure, sickness, chemical poisoning, toxins, and much more.
[00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:33.276]  They'll force you to change for the worse.
[00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:38.153]  A willing change is much better than a change by force.

[00:08:00.652 --> 00:08:06.053]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.053 --> 00:08:13.235]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:16.855]  Let's get straight into the news.
[00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:23.937]  Top story from PrisonPlanet.com referencing the El Paso Times.
[00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:27.057]  Texas crafts plan for Mexico collapse.
[00:08:27.057 --> 00:08:28.958]  The PrisonPlanet.com article.
[00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:35.313]  How long have we been telling you that Mexico is on the edge of controlled collapse?
[00:08:35.313 --> 00:08:51.721]  The Security Prosperity Partnership said through crises, through terrorism, through economic collapse, they would bring in their North American Union, and now every major publication in the country is telling the public the solution to the imploding economy, which they engineered, is world government.
[00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:53.342]  Total tyranny.
[00:08:53.342 --> 00:08:57.704]  Healthcare rationing, gun confiscation, FEMA camps, it's all being announced.
[00:08:59.133 --> 00:09:03.096]  Internment camps readied for mass illegal alien influx.
[00:09:03.096 --> 00:09:06.939]  Texas officials say contingency plans are in place for collapse of Mexico.
[00:09:06.939 --> 00:09:11.582]  Policy only covers law enforcement needs, does not address humanitarian issues.
[00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:18.127]  The news that Texas officials are working on contingency plans with the federal government to deal with a sudden influx of illegal aliens flowing
[00:09:19.929 --> 00:09:33.739]  Across the border following a collapse of the Mexican government has sparked fears that FEMA detention camps, an expansion of which is the subject of current legislation in Congress, are being readied to detain thousands of illegals as well as American citizens.
[00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:50.821]  The National Security Council drew up the Rex 84 plan in 1984 to sell the public on building giant FEMA camps in the name of putting displaced aliens, illegal aliens, and citizens.
[00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:53.784]  Then it came out that it was really a martial law plan.
[00:09:53.784 --> 00:10:01.330]  This came out in mainstream news and in hearings in Congress to take over the civilian government, overthrow Congress through the executive.
[00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.342]  Now, that's already happened.
[00:10:03.342 --> 00:10:04.423]  That's happened.
[00:10:04.423 --> 00:10:05.904]  They have declared the power.
[00:10:05.904 --> 00:10:11.128]  They're moving forward incrementally with the steps, training the military and the police to accept it.
[00:10:11.128 --> 00:10:13.070]  And everything's being transferred to foreign banks.
[00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:18.114]  We are now in receivership through fraud to the New World Order.
[00:10:18.114 --> 00:10:29.864]  According to an El Paso Times report, Texas officials are working on a plan to respond to a potential collapse of the Mexican government and the specter of thousands of fleeing north in fear for their lives, and recent reports indicate the country could be on the verge of chaos.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:36.323]  They had a staged election and the guy really lost by millions of votes, but they had the military go out and machine gun crowds.
[00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:41.726]  They're having thousands of murders and deaths now every week.
[00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:46.188]  There are rocket attacks, newspapers being firebombed in the United States.
[00:10:46.188 --> 00:10:50.491]  Homes are being burned from Texas to Arizona to Southern California.
[00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:53.492]  La Reconquista stuff is spray-painted everywhere.
[00:10:53.492 --> 00:10:57.495]  Quote, La Reconquering, The Reconquering.
[00:10:57.495 --> 00:10:59.456]  It's just a total free-for-all.
[00:11:00.316 --> 00:11:05.566]  The most dangerous place in the world is the border with Mexico, according to the State Department, four years ago.
[00:11:06.912 --> 00:11:13.258]  Routinely, and we've had the Sheriff's on, Mexican troops come as far as five miles over the border at gunpoint.
[00:11:13.258 --> 00:11:18.303]  If the police arrest a load of cocaine or marijuana, they take it at gunpoint.
[00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:26.512]  Mexican Army, the few thousand National Guard troops put down there for show have been ordered not to have weapons and are told to run if fired on.
[00:11:26.512 --> 00:11:28.954]  They do turntail and run continually.
[00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.416]  It only makes it in local papers.
[00:11:32.352 --> 00:11:40.319]  But don't worry, with the case of the Olympic swimmer and the marijuana, they've just arrested eight people and are talking about indicting him.
[00:11:40.319 --> 00:11:41.460]  Don't worry.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:41.940]  Don't worry.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:49.987]  They're going to spend lots of manpower on the Olympic swimmer smoking marijuana, but the rocket attacks, the truck bombs.
[00:11:49.987 --> 00:11:53.650]  There was a truck bomb in Dallas, but it just made a tiny mention.
[00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.372]  See, real terrorism is ignored.
[00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:06.735]  This is all caused by the phony drug war, as the Pentagon-backed Mexican government battles with other cartels not under their control to have a monopoly over the drugs.
[00:12:06.735 --> 00:12:11.059]  That's all this is, a $400 million a year industry in North America.
[00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:14.361]  And they launder the money in the big banks, that's on record.
[00:12:14.361 --> 00:12:20.326]  And so, again, another little wonderful thing the drug war gives us.
[00:12:20.326 --> 00:12:22.348]  You hope for the best but plan for the worst, Catherine.
[00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:30.818]  Sessinger, spokesman for Governor Rick Perry, said last week, at this point we've got a contingency plan that's in development.
[00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:41.885]  Texas Homeland Security Director Steve McGraw stated that the preliminary plan was in place that dealt only with law enforcement concerns and did not address humanitarian needs.
[00:12:41.885 --> 00:12:47.029]  Now, in January of 2006 it came out that
[00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:59.946]  Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown & Root had been given a huge contract to build three 1 million person camps.
[00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.769]  So for 3 million people.
[00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:04.391]  They have built those.
[00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:07.294]  They already built others under the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:13:07.294 --> 00:13:10.197]  There's now 24 military bases with camps on them.
[00:13:10.197 --> 00:13:10.717]  Don't believe me?
[00:13:10.717 --> 00:13:12.439]  Just Google Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:13.941]  You'll be on the Army's website.
[00:13:16.152 --> 00:13:22.997]  They kept it secret from when they started it in 86 to 97, declassified in 97.
[00:13:22.997 --> 00:13:25.759]  It's in my book, Dissent and Tyranny, and it's also in several of my films.
[00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:28.141]  People still don't believe it.
[00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:37.308]  So, when you hear about this legislation of building giant new FEMA camps, having local police and local pastors involved, that's just now the publication of it.
[00:13:37.308 --> 00:13:40.070]  That's now introducing it, and that'll be the PR front.
[00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:57.848]  As, you know, riots start and starving people go into them, you'll see country bands and rock bands playing on the stage for people, but they'll announce there's been some riots in the camps, and people are having to be taken to stockades, and well, you know, the camps are needed.
[00:13:57.848 --> 00:14:00.330]  The economic collapse came.
[00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:08.257]  They always know how to roll things out with the crises they create, and then, oh, they're putting troops on the streets for the illegal aliens, oh, they're putting troops on the streets
[00:14:09.321 --> 00:14:13.082]  And just outside Austin in Taylor, they have a big FEMA camp.
[00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:14.282]  We've been out there and protested it.
[00:14:14.282 --> 00:14:15.503]  We have video of it in endgame.
[00:14:15.503 --> 00:14:17.103]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:14:17.103 --> 00:14:22.984]  And they grab the illegal aliens without due process, and they don't even deport them.
[00:14:22.984 --> 00:14:28.466]  And they grab the children, and it's full of children as well, but again, it's only a beta test.
[00:14:28.466 --> 00:14:33.267]  And these people deserve due process as well.
[00:14:33.267 --> 00:14:37.268]  But they set the precedent on a group I think the public will go along with this on.
[00:14:38.493 --> 00:14:41.655]  So this ties into everything else that is currently happening.
[00:14:41.655 --> 00:14:58.244]  The rollout of the military takeover of the United States is ongoing, and with that, an increase of five billion dollars in the current black ops budget, now publicly being admitted, of fake newscasts, propaganda, paid-off reporters in the news.
[00:14:58.244 --> 00:15:02.867]  That's why you just hear endless worship of the military, endless worship of the troops.
[00:15:02.867 --> 00:15:05.828]  That's to sucker young people into thinking it's a good thing to join.
[00:15:07.049 --> 00:15:11.891]  And it's not our military, it's globalist.
[00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:12.771]  It is globalist.
[00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:16.372]  They are there to make sure the foreign banks are able to take over the United States.
[00:15:16.372 --> 00:15:24.194]  We're going to get into this with Glenn Spencer, Sheriff Richard Mack, and Officer Jack McClam coming up in the next few hours.
[00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:25.775]  Getting into the banking situation,
[00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:38.960]  On the face of it, George Bush was, and his administration was involved in the latter implementation of the banker takeover, but the Democrats were the biggest cheerleaders.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.202]  More Republicans voted against it than Democrats did.
[00:15:42.202 --> 00:15:44.083]  I'm not being partisan, I'm stating facts here.
[00:15:44.083 --> 00:15:50.287]  For all the Democrats that I hear going, oh, Barack Obama was against the banking takeover, he was against the banker bailout.
[00:15:50.287 --> 00:15:58.253]  No he wasn't, he honchoed it, and I've got it on record with Rahm Emanuel, the Chief of Staff who was in Congress at the time, bragging he's the architect of it.
[00:15:59.304 --> 00:16:01.085]  Okay.
[00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:03.688]  Point is, it's a seamless transition.
[00:16:03.688 --> 00:16:18.599]  And if you look at who he's brought in, Timothy Geithner, Summers, and others as his advisors, they are the very group under Clinton in the 90's that got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act and other laws to allow the banks to leverage and run all these derivatives and run these scams.
[00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:22.703]  And allow General Electric and everybody else to get into fractional reserve or fiat money creation.
[00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:25.428]  They just bought up the world with it.
[00:16:25.428 --> 00:16:28.174]  Now there's this big bubble they use to buy things up with.
[00:16:28.174 --> 00:16:31.982]  They hold the real assets and pass the end of the Ponzi scheme on to us.
[00:16:35.609 --> 00:16:39.852]  So all of that is going on and do you hear about indictments of Timothy Geithner?
[00:16:39.852 --> 00:16:41.373]  Do you hear about indictments of Summers?
[00:16:41.373 --> 00:16:43.655]  Do you hear about indictments of Rubin?
[00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:52.581]  No, it's how they're geniuses and how they're wonderful and how they'll fix everything when they're the very ones that engineered all this by design and broke all these laws.
[00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:56.364]  They didn't just change the laws.
[00:16:56.364 --> 00:17:01.728]  And Obama had a Freudian slip a few days ago and said, we've got to get this money flowing to the bankers, I mean to the people.
[00:17:03.362 --> 00:17:06.485]  And then the last bailout, they won't say where the money went.
[00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:11.891]  Well, they can't because all these banks are running criminal Ponzi schemes.
[00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:13.653]  That's why there's no transparency.
[00:17:13.653 --> 00:17:15.795]  And they don't want the capital flowing.
[00:17:15.795 --> 00:17:23.103]  The money goes into the banks and then the government borrows it right back from them in interest and then puts it into more government.
[00:17:23.103 --> 00:17:24.424]  And then we pay the taxes on it.
[00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:30.591]  I'm making this Obama deception film right now, and my problem is there's too much proof.
[00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:44.157]  Literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles a week, saying world government is the answer, world government, a huge giant central bank, and here it is in Time Magazine today, the headline, what's the name of the story?
[00:17:44.157 --> 00:17:46.298]  The New World Order.
[00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:48.919]  The New World Order.
[00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:50.800]  By Justin Fox.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:56.142]  And he goes through saying, oh my gosh, the banks are in trouble, it's America's fault, when America's actually been set up.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:03.169]  The world demands change and what does he say the answer is?
[00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:04.010]  Bretton Woods too.
[00:18:06.357 --> 00:18:07.777]  In the view of many outside the U.S.
[00:18:07.777 --> 00:18:14.298]  and some within, the only way to limit such excesses is through a bigger, more powerful IMF that can act as a central bank of the world.
[00:18:14.298 --> 00:18:17.999]  That means setting the rules and knocking heads when needed.
[00:18:17.999 --> 00:18:22.340]  Oh, the very bankers that engineered it will now get even more power and they'll knock heads.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.500]  Yeah, on your business, your company.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.980]  I'm reading from Time Magazine.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.381]  While everybody agrees that this new IMF needs to be less dominated by the U.S.
[00:18:29.381 --> 00:18:31.481]  See, our power is now being transferred.
[00:18:31.481 --> 00:18:35.542]  In Western Europe, things get controversial as soon as you go past voting rights.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.001]  Should capital flows be restricted?
[00:18:39.001 --> 00:18:42.603]  Should there be limits on free trade, on trade deficits and surpluses?
[00:18:42.603 --> 00:18:44.964]  See, total control over our government.
[00:18:44.964 --> 00:18:57.310]  See, what third world countries get taken over by the IMF and World Bank, and their whole governmental structure gets set and directed by them, and that's what the 2002 documents from the IMF and World Bank said they were going to do this to Europe and the US.
[00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:04.373]  They set it up, they do it, then come in with conditions saying, we'll loan you your own money back if you let us control everything.
[00:19:05.421 --> 00:19:08.884]  Continuing, should the IMF be able to order around even the U.S.?
[00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:10.105]  That's a quote.
[00:19:10.105 --> 00:19:18.431]  If the answer to any of these questions is yes, global capital will have entered a new, dramatically less freewheeling era.
[00:19:18.431 --> 00:19:20.493]  Oh, free, we don't want freewheeling, that sounds good.
[00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:30.021]  The very group of international bankers that did all of this, that we've always told you, setting up think tanks, buying off state governments, getting everybody in debt, setting the system up to do it,
[00:19:32.008 --> 00:19:40.049]  They're now coming with all these new taxes to squeeze us to take our money, give it to themselves, and then they use it to put conditions on us and loan it back to us in interest.
[00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:43.910]  Now, if that isn't sick, I don't know what is.
[00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.571]  So, it's all happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:46.571 --> 00:19:51.232]  I'll continue covering the economic news and a lot more when we get back.
[00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.732]  Then, Officer Jack McClam in ten minutes from now.
[00:19:54.732 --> 00:19:58.813]  Glenn Spencer, Sheriff Richard Mack, Representative Jim Guest, stay with us.
[00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:05.173]  When times get tough, we must all decide what's most important in life.
[00:20:05.173 --> 00:20:10.639]  At EnduringRose.com, we believe that lasting relationships are what make life most meaningful.
[00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:15.445]  Showing our loved ones that we care is what helps us find happiness in an uncertain world.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.726]  Enduring Rose can help.
[00:20:17.113 --> 00:20:23.697]  We have taken real roses, the universal symbols of love, and coated them in eternal and precious 24 karat gold.
[00:20:23.697 --> 00:20:28.641]  These roses, forever preserved in either white or yellow gold, will never wither and never die.
[00:20:28.641 --> 00:20:32.303]  Unlike traditional roses, they will endure as a timeless symbol of your love.
[00:20:32.645 --> 00:20:40.448]  These roses, either singles or bouquets, are sensible and affordable Valentine's Day gifts that will impress and deeply touch that special someone in your life.
[00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:45.389]  Show her that your love will weather the storm by giving her a gold-dipped rose from Enduring Rose.
[00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:48.630]  We offer military discounts and free shipping on qualified orders.
[00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.471]  That's E-N-D-U-R-I-N-G Rose.
[00:20:51.471 --> 00:20:53.552]  EnduringRose.com or call 702-453-7455.
[00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:53.932]  That's 702-453-7455.
[00:21:00.796 --> 00:21:07.561]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:07.561 --> 00:21:10.204]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:10.204 --> 00:21:11.765]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:11.765 --> 00:21:12.566]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:12.566 --> 00:21:13.606]  This is his M.O.
[00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:14.947]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:14.947 --> 00:21:16.929]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:24.075]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:24.555]  Some U.S.
[00:21:24.555 --> 00:21:30.200]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.403]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:34.403 --> 00:21:37.185]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:00.674 --> 00:22:01.734]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:01.734 --> 00:22:06.677]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:06.677 --> 00:22:14.740]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:20.323]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:20.323 --> 00:22:27.306]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:27.606 --> 00:22:33.189]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:33.189 --> 00:22:38.271]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:38.271 --> 00:22:46.215]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:46.215 --> 00:22:52.778]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:52.778 --> 00:22:53.899]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.618 --> 00:22:56.899]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.069 --> 00:23:04.971]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:23:04.971 --> 00:23:12.414]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:23:12.414 --> 00:23:14.035]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:23:14.035 --> 00:23:18.197]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:23:18.197 --> 00:23:22.018]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:23:22.018 --> 00:23:26.500]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.441]  Phase 1 is a One World Currency.
[00:23:28.621 --> 00:23:30.833]  Which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:23:30.833 --> 00:23:32.784]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is...
[00:23:34.724 --> 00:23:35.305]  We're good to go.
[00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:14.469]  You've got all these well-meaning fools that think that Obama's really bringing them peace.
[00:24:14.469 --> 00:24:32.557]  We've seen all the rallies he had during the campaign on the 91, and then incredible stuff the last few days, where they said, oh my gosh, Obama's gonna fix everything, I'll never have bills anymore, I'll never have problems anymore, my whole life is solved, everything's okay!
[00:24:33.948 --> 00:24:36.492]  And Newsweek tells you, that's right, we're all socialists now.
[00:24:36.492 --> 00:24:40.658]  The government can fix it when they engineered it all by design.
[00:24:40.658 --> 00:24:43.923]  Notice how he came into office right as the crisis deepens.
[00:24:43.923 --> 00:24:47.568]  The government that had been telling you everything was fine with the economy says, yes, we're going into a depression.
[00:24:49.065 --> 00:24:54.349]  Everybody gets completely scared, and like Kim Jong-il in North Korea, they say, our dear leader will save us.
[00:24:54.349 --> 00:25:12.945]  We've got videos, we're going to play later, of people collapsing and crying and begging him at town halls, saying, please, I've lost everything, I'm losing my job, and he says, I will save you, and hugs them, and they start crying, and he hugs the woman, and the husband's going, thank you, oh, you've saved me, ah!
[00:25:12.945 --> 00:25:16.048]  And they have no idea that he's run by the banks and engineered it all.
[00:25:17.418 --> 00:25:20.342]  That's why he says, well, I'm going to save you, but it's going to be austere.
[00:25:20.342 --> 00:25:21.563]  It's going to get rough.
[00:25:21.563 --> 00:25:26.590]  They go, good, good, oh, thank you.
[00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.353]  They taught everybody to hate George Bush, who was just their puppet.
[00:25:29.353 --> 00:25:34.120]  They put all the hatred of Bush, they transmuted that into love for Barack Obama.
[00:25:37.085 --> 00:25:44.833]  And now the very banks that engineered the entire crisis by design are fully bankrupting and sucking the country dry.
[00:25:44.833 --> 00:25:47.576]  Hundreds and hundreds of new taxes are being erected.
[00:25:47.576 --> 00:25:48.497]  Total control.
[00:25:48.497 --> 00:25:50.439]  FEMA camps are being built.
[00:25:50.439 --> 00:25:54.003]  And Obama can tell his people, oh, you're hungry, go to these facilities.
[00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:55.425]  And they'll show them going to the facilities.
[00:25:55.885 --> 00:26:02.830]  And they'll show them happy playing volleyball at the facilities, and then the President said, See, you always said the Army was going to take over Alex, and they did!
[00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.433]  But they helped us, and then the terrorists will strike.
[00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:17.982]  Oh, and they've got to arrest thousands and tens of thousands of people that were aiding the terrorists, and then they've got to arrest people that weren't going along with the government, and people that didn't let their farm or ranch be nationalized.
[00:26:17.982 --> 00:26:19.883]  You know, this is socialism.
[00:26:19.883 --> 00:26:22.786]  You've got to share to help the people.
[00:26:22.786 --> 00:26:24.187]  This is what's got to happen.
[00:26:25.094 --> 00:26:26.876]  And the cops will be like, things are tough now.
[00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:33.182]  I never thought America would get like this, but just like we had to get rid of the Bill of Rights after 9-11, well now we got to start arresting everybody.
[00:26:33.182 --> 00:26:35.404]  Because, you know, I need my job.
[00:26:35.404 --> 00:26:36.505]  I got a family too.
[00:26:36.505 --> 00:26:40.529]  I know they took most of my pension fund, but everybody's having to sacrifice.
[00:26:40.529 --> 00:26:45.854]  And they're telling the people in California they're not going to get their retirements through government now.
[00:26:47.253 --> 00:26:49.635]  And they've got to take pay cuts.
[00:26:49.635 --> 00:27:01.162]  But don't worry, the taxes actually go up because once you go into this phase, most of the money goes to interest of the foreign banks that had the government create the money and give it to them and then back to us at interest.
[00:27:01.162 --> 00:27:02.502]  And it's all fiat.
[00:27:02.502 --> 00:27:06.725]  We've still got the industry, the factories, the roads, the systems globally.
[00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:07.466]  It's all.
[00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:09.447]  The entire economy is perception.
[00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:15.650]  The entire economy is faith and they have destroyed that faith by design.
[00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:20.640]  They had Bush with the torture and the secret arrest and the lying about WMDs all scripted.
[00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:27.408]  They were more than happy for the truth about 9-11 being an inside job to come out, as long as no prosecutions happened.
[00:27:27.408 --> 00:27:30.949]  That was then blamed on the U.S., not the full global system.
[00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:36.611]  This is masterful psychological warfare, and that's why the elites are in control.
[00:27:36.611 --> 00:27:41.713]  And I'm here to tell you, they are trying to set up a Stalinistic slash Nazi system.
[00:27:41.713 --> 00:27:44.794]  And they think because of political correctness and the liberal brainwashing,
[00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:50.438]  That the public will buy it because it's impossible for tyranny to come from a black man.
[00:27:50.438 --> 00:27:53.840]  It can only come from a white man.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.682]  When right in front of him he's lied about everything.
[00:27:56.682 --> 00:27:59.724]  First he said that six months after he got in that all the troops would be home.
[00:27:59.724 --> 00:28:01.365]  Then it was 16 months.
[00:28:01.365 --> 00:28:02.266]  Then it was 18 months.
[00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:05.328]  Now they've said 24 months and then they'll look at it.
[00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:08.550]  Bush used to say in a year and then we'll look at it.
[00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.750]  Now it's two years and we'll look at it.
[00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.671]  I mean, every week it goes up by four or five months.
[00:28:12.671 --> 00:28:15.092]  What will it be, twenty years in a few years?
[00:28:15.092 --> 00:28:19.773]  Oh, we'll look at leaving in twenty years.
[00:28:19.773 --> 00:28:22.754]  Of course, you don't have to listen to the rhetoric of the frontman Obama.
[00:28:22.754 --> 00:28:29.956]  You can actually read what the Pentagon says in their own documents and they say they're going to be a hundred year war, setting up military bases, training the Iraqis,
[00:28:30.984 --> 00:28:49.529]  Cross-border insurgency, staged terror in Iran, bringing Iran down, attacking Syria, bringing them down, putting troops in Pakistan, keeping them in Afghanistan, linking up to the Chinese border, taking over Georgia, other sectors, and having the NATO force all the way coming down from Poland, and of course, north of that,
[00:28:51.966 --> 00:29:05.756]  Northern European countries that are already NATO, straight through from the North Sea, on the Atlantic Ocean, all the way over to China, on to China's doorstep, a crescent, a ring of military forces.
[00:29:05.756 --> 00:29:11.461]  But we have to first be bankrupt, put into a brave new world, 1984 system, for the war with East Asia.
[00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:12.441]  For the war.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.401]  With Eurasia.
[00:29:24.401 --> 00:29:26.923]  I mean, this is the Anglo-American attack profile.
[00:29:26.923 --> 00:29:37.648]  You know, George Orwell worked in the secret police, then he was a propagandist at BBC, and before he died, a year after publishing the book, he said, no, this is what they're planning to do.
[00:29:37.648 --> 00:29:39.189]  Cameras in the toilets.
[00:29:39.189 --> 00:29:40.310]  Cameras in the bathrooms.
[00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.870]  We now have that in the U.S.
[00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:43.491]  for the schools.
[00:29:43.491 --> 00:29:44.232]  The rest stops.
[00:29:44.232 --> 00:29:49.374]  See, that's what they want, a boot stomping on the human face forever.
[00:29:49.374 --> 00:29:50.215]  And they mean to do it.
[00:29:51.058 --> 00:29:52.459]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:55.001]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.001 --> 00:30:01.166]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:02.066]  You worry.
[00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:04.128]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:30:04.128 --> 00:30:06.770]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.891]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:10.513]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:30:10.513 --> 00:30:14.095]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:30:14.095 --> 00:30:18.939]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:30:19.332 --> 00:30:23.293]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:30:23.293 --> 00:30:24.974]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:30:24.974 --> 00:30:27.875]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:30:27.875 --> 00:30:31.337]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:30:31.337 --> 00:30:39.980]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.802]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:31:37.286 --> 00:31:43.270]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.111]  My weekly news television broadcast.
[00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:48.113]  Thousands of exclusive audio interviews and so much more.
[00:31:48.113 --> 00:31:50.955]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[00:31:50.955 --> 00:31:53.016]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:53.016 --> 00:31:54.997]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[00:31:54.997 --> 00:31:57.139]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:31:57.139 --> 00:31:58.920]  Bring down the new world order.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.661]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.471]  Your engine is the heart of your vehicle.
[00:32:04.471 --> 00:32:07.752]  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to determine whether it's going to go the long run?
[00:32:07.752 --> 00:32:11.092]  Or should you dump your vehicle before you experience a major expense?
[00:32:11.092 --> 00:32:15.554]  The military has developed such a technology, and it's called Oil Analysis.
[00:32:15.554 --> 00:32:23.756]  By taking a mere 4-ounce sample during an oil change, you can get an easy-to-read, complete report by an independent laboratory covering engine wear,
[00:32:24.136 --> 00:32:25.917]  Oil Condition and Contamination
[00:32:54.036 --> 00:32:54.937]  Come, you masters of war!
[00:32:54.937 --> 00:32:55.917]  Here to build the big guns!
[00:32:55.917 --> 00:32:57.118]  Here to build the death planes!
[00:32:57.118 --> 00:32:58.118]  Here to build all the bombs!
[00:33:21.089 --> 00:33:37.403]  You that hide behind walls You that hide behind desks I just want you to know I can see through your masks You that never done nothing
[00:33:39.793 --> 00:33:42.254]  Hey, I've got a surprise for everybody.
[00:33:42.254 --> 00:33:44.934]  Officer Jack McClam is joining us in about 25 minutes.
[00:33:44.934 --> 00:33:49.035]  So get him on at the next break, John.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:57.938]  Then we've got Glenn Spencer, Sheriff Richard Mack, and Representative Jim Guest from Missouri.
[00:33:57.938 --> 00:33:59.378]  But George Humphrey
[00:34:01.035 --> 00:34:11.538]  He is a former city council member, a degreed economist, a very successful businessman with all sorts of ventures, national clothing lines, you name it, author, filmmaker.
[00:34:11.538 --> 00:34:18.640]  He was over here dropping off some of his films and books that we sell at InfoWars.com on the Secure Online Video Bookstore shopping cart.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.381]  And he's always traveling to India and Europe and California and everywhere else, and I've been trying to get a hold of him for two weeks.
[00:34:24.381 --> 00:34:25.722]  Do you have a cell phone?
[00:34:27.842 --> 00:34:29.103]  I do, but I hardly care.
[00:34:29.103 --> 00:34:30.585]  No, no, no.
[00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:32.306]  I mean either, but all I have is your home numbers.
[00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:37.971]  I've got to get it because I wanted to put you in the Obama deception film because you're an economist.
[00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:41.454]  And then thank God you just show up at the office now because I've been calling you for two weeks, three weeks.
[00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:46.098]  We're going to get you in here to tape this week, but it's great to have you here.
[00:34:46.098 --> 00:34:50.341]  And so I just thought we'd have you in here for one segment while you're popping in.
[00:34:50.341 --> 00:34:53.844]  Before the last break, I was getting into the fact that
[00:34:54.927 --> 00:34:57.970]  We knew that the private central banks were setting up world government, which is simple.
[00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.372]  It's a corporate takeover of nation states.
[00:35:00.372 --> 00:35:15.584]  I think the quote put out by the presidential candidate who ran against LBJ, Barry Goldwater, is the best, where he just describes it's foreign banks come in and buy off your government and set up their own structure and remove checks and balances.
[00:35:15.584 --> 00:35:21.469]  But now they're in hundreds of publications, George, as you know, every day, including Time Magazine this week,
[00:35:22.089 --> 00:35:31.752]  Saying we need a world government bank, a super IMF world bank that controls our currency, that sets the rules and, quote, knocks heads worldwide.
[00:35:31.752 --> 00:35:34.352]  Now, we know from their own documents, this has always been the plan.
[00:35:34.352 --> 00:35:39.034]  Now that they're announcing it, for me means they're making their move right now.
[00:35:39.034 --> 00:35:43.635]  We're finally, and the FEMA camps, the taxes, the carbon taxes,
[00:35:44.695 --> 00:35:50.460]  People treating Obama like he's a messianic savior, like Kim Jong-il just falling down and begging.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.484]  It went from hope and change to do what I say or the crisis will be a catastrophe.
[00:35:54.484 --> 00:36:02.951]  So can you speak to what it's like for 16, 17 years you've been fighting and to now be proven totally right and it's all happening?
[00:36:03.251 --> 00:36:17.079]  Well, that's kind of funny that you're bringing this right up, because this morning, a really dear friend of mine who owns a large manufacturing business up in Michigan, who for 18 years has been fighting me.
[00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:24.403]  He's a staunch Republican, and he's been just saying, George, you are absolutely crazy about this New World Order stuff.
[00:36:24.403 --> 00:36:29.026]  And we're dear friends, and he's a good man, and he just has a different point of view.
[00:36:29.026 --> 00:36:31.768]  And just this morning, he calls up and he says, you know, George,
[00:36:32.688 --> 00:36:33.369]  You're right.
[00:36:33.369 --> 00:36:46.465]  For the last 18 years, what you've been telling me about the New World Order, and about the banks, and about the takeover, and about the deception of the Republicans and the Democrats, and the false flags, he says, you're right.
[00:36:46.465 --> 00:36:46.946]  And I said...
[00:36:47.907 --> 00:36:49.668]  You know, I love you Bob.
[00:36:49.668 --> 00:36:53.151]  You're a great guy and it's not about me being right.
[00:36:53.151 --> 00:37:02.378]  It's about us protecting our country, about us protecting our environment, about us protecting our families, about us protecting ourselves.
[00:37:02.378 --> 00:37:13.766]  And right now, right now is the time that all of us have to get up and wake up and take the steps because this is no dress rehearsal.
[00:37:13.766 --> 00:37:15.548]  Obama is the biggest
[00:37:16.926 --> 00:37:20.189]  He's the biggest Trojan horse there ever has been.
[00:37:20.189 --> 00:37:26.435]  Their putting Obama in has been so unbelievably, incredibly well thought out.
[00:37:26.435 --> 00:37:30.339]  You know, this whole thing about Obama being an African American.
[00:37:30.339 --> 00:37:39.428]  I mean, it's just, it's silly, but it's a stroke of genius on their parts because he has just cemented in the hardcore left wing of the Democratic Party.
[00:37:40.169 --> 00:37:43.133]  And a high percentage of the blacks in this country.
[00:37:43.133 --> 00:37:54.565]  And even though it's just so obvious, and you did such a great job 15 minutes ago about talking about Obama and all of his appointments, and as I've told everybody,
[00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.767]  The fruit is the mark of the tree, not the flower.
[00:37:57.767 --> 00:38:01.628]  Now, clearly Obama is intelligent, he's charismatic.
[00:38:01.628 --> 00:38:02.428]  He's a flower!
[00:38:02.428 --> 00:38:04.108]  He's a beautiful flower.
[00:38:04.108 --> 00:38:06.089]  But his fruit is rotten.
[00:38:06.089 --> 00:38:07.049]  It's poison.
[00:38:07.049 --> 00:38:08.369]  It's poison.
[00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:13.851]  And all you have to do is take a look at the people he's put around him.
[00:38:13.851 --> 00:38:16.771]  The guy who's at his right hand 24-7, Rahm Emanuel,
[00:38:19.332 --> 00:38:28.218]  is one of the most vicious people in this whole nation, and he wants to go and nuke Iran right now.
[00:38:28.218 --> 00:38:32.141]  Not just the military bases, but he wants to nuke Tehran.
[00:38:32.141 --> 00:38:33.882]  His father was an assassin.
[00:38:33.882 --> 00:38:39.186]  He used to... Rahm Emanuel's father used to assassinate British envoys.
[00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:41.827]  I mean... Well, he was a leader in the...
[00:38:43.399 --> 00:38:47.240]  Israeli terror organization that blew up hotels and false flags.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.040]  Absolutely.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:48.920]  That's on record.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:53.141]  Yeah, and his whole family has Israeli passports.
[00:38:53.141 --> 00:39:01.103]  And it's nothing against Israel or, you know, because I don't have a dog in the race between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
[00:39:01.103 --> 00:39:04.064]  But it's clear that Israel is heavily involved in the overthrow of the U.S.
[00:39:04.444 --> 00:39:05.485]  There's no question.
[00:39:05.485 --> 00:39:06.786]  It's not all Israelis.
[00:39:06.786 --> 00:39:09.168]  Most Israelis, like most Americans, don't know what's going on.
[00:39:09.168 --> 00:39:14.232]  But I mean, they brag in the Israeli papers now that, I mean, whether it's true or not, they're saying they run this country.
[00:39:14.232 --> 00:39:15.893]  There's no question about that.
[00:39:15.893 --> 00:39:18.675]  And so as patriots, we have to go ahead and step into the fray.
[00:39:18.675 --> 00:39:20.597]  Let me just read a quote here from Barry Goldwater.
[00:39:20.597 --> 00:39:24.460]  The Trilateral Commission is intended... Now listen carefully, folks.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.942]  This is what's happening now, and this is the most trilateral commission administration we've ever seen.
[00:39:28.763 --> 00:39:37.948]  The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[00:39:37.948 --> 00:39:45.512]  The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of political power.
[00:39:45.512 --> 00:39:49.494]  Monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical, and political.
[00:39:50.114 --> 00:40:00.280]  And it goes on to say, what the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power, a worldwide economic power, superior to the political governments of the nation states involved.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.043]  As managers and creators of a system, they will rule the future.
[00:40:04.043 --> 00:40:08.926]  In his book, published in the 70s, with no apologies, Barry Goldwater.
[00:40:09.426 --> 00:40:14.609]  When you read the Financial Times of London and Time Magazine and Wall Street Journal, they're saying, we just got an idea!
[00:40:14.609 --> 00:40:21.013]  A world government run by a new super bank that'll set the currencies that you'll pay taxes to and carbon taxes to.
[00:40:21.013 --> 00:40:22.174]  It's the only thing that'll save us.
[00:40:22.174 --> 00:40:24.055]  If you don't do it, the economy's destroyed.
[00:40:24.055 --> 00:40:28.678]  When it's the very central banks, we had this from Bilderberg three years ago, that we're going to pop the subprime mortgage.
[00:40:28.678 --> 00:40:35.963]  A year and a half before that began, we have Daniel Estlin with sources in Bilderberg, in in-game blueprint for global enslavement, on record saying that.
[00:40:35.963 --> 00:40:38.505]  And then here it is in Time Magazine today,
[00:40:40.393 --> 00:40:48.778]  It says that what they need is a more powerful IMF that can act as a central bank to the world and knock heads when needed.
[00:40:48.778 --> 00:40:51.360]  And it says even over the United States.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:51.640]  George?
[00:40:54.025 --> 00:41:04.489]  You know, it's almost laughable because you and I have been talking about this very thing day in, day out, week in and week out for the last 15 years.
[00:41:04.489 --> 00:41:12.412]  I remember when we used to go down to the television station and, you know, every single week we would read those quotes, we'd talk about these things.
[00:41:12.412 --> 00:41:13.572]  People that worked there would laugh at us.
[00:41:13.812 --> 00:41:16.773]  They would just... They'd be rude to us at the counter?
[00:41:16.773 --> 00:41:21.955]  Well, there were some good people down there... But now it's like a red carpet, and they're just like, oh, you're right, oh, what do I do?
[00:41:21.955 --> 00:41:26.936]  And everywhere I go, people are coming up and saying, you're right.
[00:41:26.936 --> 00:41:31.298]  And then, most importantly, they're saying, what can we do?
[00:41:31.298 --> 00:41:33.298]  What do we do?
[00:41:33.298 --> 00:41:37.220]  And because, clearly, the information that you and I and many other
[00:41:38.573 --> 00:41:41.317]  Wonderful patriots have been putting out.
[00:41:41.317 --> 00:41:45.583]  Everybody knows that the pirates have taken control of the ship.
[00:41:45.583 --> 00:41:48.527]  We have mafia running this country.
[00:41:48.527 --> 00:41:53.634]  Anybody who looks at Joe Biden and can't tell that he is a mafia don is just... I mean, he's just...
[00:41:54.996 --> 00:42:06.926]  It's just so apparent, this quote, bailout stimulus package is the greatest theft and transfer of wealth in the history of Occidental history.
[00:42:06.926 --> 00:42:09.207]  It is just unbelievable.
[00:42:09.207 --> 00:42:20.016]  And it's going on right before our eyes, and the people of this nation are in a comatose state, and their eyes wide shut.
[00:42:20.737 --> 00:42:28.947]  But the good news is that more and more and more people every day are waking up to this reality.
[00:42:28.947 --> 00:42:30.730]  And that's why they're accelerating their program?
[00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.071]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:42:32.071 --> 00:42:35.416]  And the good thing is that people are saying,
[00:42:36.036 --> 00:42:37.397]  What can we do?
[00:42:37.397 --> 00:42:39.717]  And there's two things that we have to be aware of.
[00:42:39.717 --> 00:42:51.902]  We have to be aware of the First Awakening, which is the political, economic manipulation of the forces of separation of fear on the people of this nation.
[00:42:51.902 --> 00:43:00.985]  There is no question, none question whatsoever, that the people who control our country are into enslaving the people of this world.
[00:43:01.525 --> 00:43:06.768]  And then there's the second awakening, because clearly, we can't beat them with guns or money.
[00:43:06.768 --> 00:43:08.430]  Right now, we can't beat them.
[00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:09.630]  They've got too many guns.
[00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:17.856]  Now that's not to say that we shouldn't have guns, and that we shouldn't stand up, and we shouldn't fight, but we've got to fight in a smart way.
[00:43:18.556 --> 00:43:25.581]  And the second awakening is realizing that we have to beat them with a change in paradigm.
[00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:27.642]  We have to become self-sufficient.
[00:43:27.642 --> 00:43:30.023]  We have to get out of victim consciousness.
[00:43:30.023 --> 00:43:33.306]  We have to realize that each and every one of us is powerful.
[00:43:33.306 --> 00:43:34.126]  Humans are incredible.
[00:43:34.126 --> 00:43:36.948]  We have incredible power, and it's your destiny.
[00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:39.189]  You're not fulfilled because you're not fighting evil.
[00:43:39.189 --> 00:43:41.251]  You're not fulfilled because you don't respect yourself.
[00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:43.792]  That's why so many people now would deny what we were saying.
[00:43:43.792 --> 00:43:45.674]  Now they admit it, but they say there's nothing we can do.
[00:43:46.534 --> 00:43:49.817]  The power of the human spirit, the dynamic human spirit.
[00:43:49.817 --> 00:43:52.499]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a test.
[00:43:52.499 --> 00:43:53.660]  We are put here.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.023]  This is all playing out as a test.
[00:43:56.023 --> 00:44:01.367]  Absolutely, and clearly it all depends upon one's philosophy about metaphysics.
[00:44:01.367 --> 00:44:07.333]  I believe that there is a creative energy of this universe that is good and loving, and I know
[00:44:07.813 --> 00:44:07.993]  I think?
[00:44:25.743 --> 00:44:31.605]  Well, world, we have to... I mean, look at how the enemy tries to sell death and destruction and evil as if it's fine.
[00:44:31.605 --> 00:44:35.406]  They know that we're weakened once we enter into that greedy system.
[00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:35.966]  Absolutely.
[00:44:35.966 --> 00:44:41.688]  And the materialism of what Christians call mammon is so very real.
[00:44:41.688 --> 00:44:43.669]  And this is not a test.
[00:44:43.669 --> 00:44:47.110]  And as you know, I go to India every year.
[00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.211]  I study the ancient Vedas.
[00:44:49.211 --> 00:44:51.332]  I study the scripts of Buddha.
[00:44:51.332 --> 00:44:51.832]  I've studied
[00:44:52.392 --> 00:45:00.997]  The Koran, I've studied all the ancient teachings and every single teaching has pointed to this period of time.
[00:45:00.997 --> 00:45:06.800]  Whether it's Nostradamus or Cayce or the Mayans or whatever.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:12.483]  But it doesn't take prophecy to figure out that these next five years... Humanity is at a crossroads.
[00:45:12.483 --> 00:45:13.404]  We're at a crossroads.
[00:45:13.404 --> 00:45:14.585]  These next five years
[00:45:15.405 --> 00:45:21.610]  And there's no knight in silver armor that's going to come up and save us.
[00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:23.691]  It's up to you and me.
[00:45:23.691 --> 00:45:24.492]  Look in the mirror.
[00:45:24.492 --> 00:45:26.573]  You want to see the solution, it's in the mirror.
[00:45:26.573 --> 00:45:27.474]  Absolutely.
[00:45:27.474 --> 00:45:31.497]  And the first thing is to realize you are not a victim.
[00:45:31.497 --> 00:45:38.382]  You are endowed with all of the energy and the will and the power of the creative force, God.
[00:45:38.982 --> 00:45:43.327]  And that, and this is what Gandhi had to get through to the people of India.
[00:45:43.327 --> 00:45:48.894]  When he came back to India in the late, when he came back in the late teens.
[00:45:48.894 --> 00:45:49.614]  From South Africa.
[00:45:49.614 --> 00:45:51.136]  Yeah, from South Africa.
[00:45:51.136 --> 00:45:54.220]  He realized that the mentality of the Indian people.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.181]  They were mentally beaten.
[00:45:55.581 --> 00:45:56.482]  Absolutely.
[00:45:56.482 --> 00:46:00.966]  There are only 300,000 British there, and there are 300 million Indians there.
[00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:07.072]  By numbers, the Indians could have stamped them out in a matter of moments, but they had, they were enslaved.
[00:46:07.072 --> 00:46:09.274]  They also used Indian front people, like Obama.
[00:46:09.274 --> 00:46:09.614]  Absolutely.
[00:46:09.614 --> 00:46:11.376]  That's what they used Indian chiefs here.
[00:46:11.376 --> 00:46:12.877]  They used front people.
[00:46:12.877 --> 00:46:15.339]  And, you know, we have to...
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.501]  Give accolades to the Illuminati.
[00:46:18.501 --> 00:46:24.123]  I mean, the picking of Obama was absolutely a work of genius.
[00:46:24.123 --> 00:46:26.124]  I mean, this guy is unbelievable.
[00:46:26.124 --> 00:46:33.447]  Listen, I'm watching, see, first they say, I'm going to fix all your problems, and the women and men are saying, oh, I don't have any more bills, everything's fine.
[00:46:33.447 --> 00:46:45.532]  Then he comes in, as they tell you, everything's darkening, he says, I'll fix it, do whatever I say, and these people, they are worshipping like he's Elvis, or the Beatles, or Hitler.
[00:46:45.532 --> 00:46:46.092]  It's unbelievable.
[00:46:46.152 --> 00:46:49.634]  And they're crying, going, ahhhhh!
[00:46:49.634 --> 00:46:53.777]  And they have no idea this guy is sitting directly by the beast.
[00:46:53.777 --> 00:47:02.423]  Yesterday I was having lunch with a very, very dear friend of mine, and a good person, and I was asking him about Obama, and he was telling me about all the good things.
[00:47:02.423 --> 00:47:04.724]  And this guy is very involved.
[00:47:04.724 --> 00:47:08.707]  Restaurants are now putting his picture up like we're in Nazi Germany.
[00:47:08.707 --> 00:47:09.588]  His picture's everywhere.
[00:47:09.588 --> 00:47:10.929]  They're like little shrines.
[00:47:10.929 --> 00:47:15.051]  In East Austin, there is an Obama retail store right now.
[00:47:16.752 --> 00:47:18.253]  It's amazing to me.
[00:47:18.253 --> 00:47:20.975]  Again, any time that happens in history, that's deadly dangerous.
[00:47:20.975 --> 00:47:24.998]  And quite clearly, look at the people he surrounded himself with.
[00:47:24.998 --> 00:47:29.220]  What's the guy he put in as Secretary of Agriculture?
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.721]  He's the Monsanto guy.
[00:47:30.721 --> 00:47:32.042]  Yeah, they're all bad.
[00:47:32.042 --> 00:47:38.647]  And he put in the biggest hardcore agribusiness, frankenfood person there is.
[00:47:38.647 --> 00:47:42.209]  And clearly, agriculture is the key for freedom.
[00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:45.231]  And that's why they have the animal ID, the premises ID.
[00:47:45.231 --> 00:47:53.095]  Yeah, and so, you know, he kept Gates as Secretary of Defense, he's broken his promise about getting troops out of Iraq.
[00:47:53.095 --> 00:47:54.876]  Now they're saying 24 months in Iraq.
[00:47:54.876 --> 00:47:59.558]  Yeah, and they're increasing, they're surging in Afghanistan.
[00:48:02.099 --> 00:48:12.113]  The reason he got his initial group of support was because he voted against this insanity in the Middle East and all these people thought he was the peace candidate.
[00:48:12.113 --> 00:48:13.515]  And that was just positioning?
[00:48:13.515 --> 00:48:14.677]  It was positioning.
[00:48:14.677 --> 00:48:17.380]  It had nothing to do with idealism.
[00:48:18.391 --> 00:48:34.703]  And the fact that they have, you know, after he was elected, I heard the day of his inauguration, I heard on the television at least 75 times, this is the first African-American ever elected to the United States.
[00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:41.808]  Well, his mother is Caucasian, his father was 80% Arab and 20% African.
[00:48:41.808 --> 00:48:46.031]  And I don't care whether he's black, blue, brown, or orange,
[00:48:46.992 --> 00:48:49.755]  But he's 10% African.
[00:48:49.755 --> 00:48:51.877]  Does that make him an African American?
[00:48:51.877 --> 00:48:55.982]  And it is absolutely the fluff.
[00:48:55.982 --> 00:48:58.885]  I mean, I'm like 6 or 8% I forget Native American.
[00:48:58.885 --> 00:48:59.846]  Does that make me Native American?
[00:49:01.747 --> 00:49:02.688]  It's just amazing!
[00:49:02.688 --> 00:49:07.693]  And it is just such a sales pitch.
[00:49:07.693 --> 00:49:09.775]  And we don't need sales pitches right now.
[00:49:09.775 --> 00:49:20.465]  What we need is honesty and hard work and self-sufficiency, and we need to include the people of this country in the healing of this country.
[00:49:20.465 --> 00:49:22.327]  We don't need all of this
[00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:26.772]  BS, all of these lies, all of these promotions.
[00:49:26.772 --> 00:49:27.952]  Well, listen, George, we're out of time.
[00:49:27.952 --> 00:49:29.913]  I've got Jack McClain coming up.
[00:49:29.913 --> 00:49:32.954]  Right now, hey, will you guys call Joey Vee in here, please?
[00:49:32.954 --> 00:49:35.696]  Because I've got to run, you've got to run.
[00:49:35.696 --> 00:49:37.316]  I want to get you in for an hour this week.
[00:49:37.316 --> 00:49:37.917]  Beautiful.
[00:49:37.917 --> 00:49:41.198]  And then, after that, we'll do the interview for the Obama deception.
[00:49:41.198 --> 00:49:41.898]  Okay, great.
[00:49:41.898 --> 00:49:46.841]  Because this is perfect that you showed up now, because I've got about 60% of the film done.
[00:49:46.841 --> 00:49:50.462]  I've never made a film in like two or three months, but it's turning out so good.
[00:49:50.462 --> 00:49:51.783]  I was at it about six months research before.
[00:49:51.943 --> 00:49:55.564]  As I heard you say, you've got more material than you know what to do with.
[00:49:55.564 --> 00:49:57.524]  Exactly, but I want you as an economist.
[00:49:57.524 --> 00:49:59.885]  Hey, Joey V, come on in here.
[00:49:59.885 --> 00:50:00.605]  Do you have the schedule?
[00:50:00.605 --> 00:50:03.086]  I just want to right now get him set up for this week.
[00:50:03.086 --> 00:50:07.407]  Do we have an opening in the last hour that way I can do interviews with him after?
[00:50:07.407 --> 00:50:10.688]  Fantastic.
[00:50:10.688 --> 00:50:11.128]  Awesome.
[00:50:11.128 --> 00:50:13.249]  Just get with him as soon as this break comes up.
[00:50:15.836 --> 00:50:20.841]  Let's get you in here and run through all these great points you've made, because I want to include you in the Obama Deception.
[00:50:20.841 --> 00:50:26.888]  And Alex, I just have to tell your viewers, what you are doing right now is so positive.
[00:50:26.888 --> 00:50:28.309]  You are getting out the message.
[00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:31.593]  You're growing in your courage in what you're doing.
[00:50:31.593 --> 00:50:32.574]  I just love you.
[00:50:32.574 --> 00:50:33.314]  I'll talk to you later, buddy.
[00:50:33.314 --> 00:50:33.975]  Well, I appreciate it.
[00:50:33.975 --> 00:50:35.216]  I mean, we don't have a lot of time.
[00:50:35.216 --> 00:50:37.619]  So, I mean, I know the enemy's up in their game.
[00:50:37.619 --> 00:50:38.200]  We're up in our game.
[00:50:39.073 --> 00:50:39.373]  You betcha.
[00:50:39.373 --> 00:50:40.274]  Talk to you later.
[00:50:40.274 --> 00:50:41.094]  Alright, bro.
[00:50:41.094 --> 00:50:42.495]  There goes George Humberyard.
[00:50:42.495 --> 00:50:46.857]  He's going to be in studio with us later this week, and he's going to be in the Obama Deception.
[00:50:46.857 --> 00:50:48.758]  So we're going to set this up right now.
[00:50:48.758 --> 00:50:57.083]  We're going to come back with Officer Jack McClam and get into the whole... I forgot to get into FEMA camps with George, but we'll do that when he's back in later this week.
[00:50:57.083 --> 00:51:01.926]  InfoWars.com's the website.
[00:51:01.926 --> 00:51:05.068]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[00:51:05.068 --> 00:51:07.329]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:12.233]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[00:51:12.233 --> 00:51:17.636]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[00:51:17.636 --> 00:51:25.881]  GetSeeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with a complete range of crops.

[00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:07.516]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.516 --> 00:52:10.159]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.159 --> 00:52:11.700]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.500]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.441]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:13.441 --> 00:52:14.882]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:16.864]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.864 --> 00:52:24.010]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:24.490]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:30.135]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.835 --> 00:52:34.338]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.338 --> 00:52:37.139]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:02.668 --> 00:53:06.013]  Stop wasting your time with everything you are trying to learn.
[00:53:06.013 --> 00:53:08.536]  Learning should be a pleasure, not torture.
[00:53:08.536 --> 00:53:15.085]  The School of Phenomenal Memory gives you the training and tools you need to memorize any type of information quickly and efficiently.

[00:54:13.791 --> 00:54:14.612]  We were on target.
[00:54:15.746 --> 00:54:17.107]  And the enemy is moving.
[00:54:17.107 --> 00:54:17.968]  This is it.
[00:54:17.968 --> 00:54:19.529]  It is now happening.
[00:54:19.529 --> 00:54:25.673]  All the preparations of decades to set up world government, a tyrannical system to track and trace everything you do, it's now here.
[00:54:25.673 --> 00:54:28.195]  And the people are listening more than ever now.
[00:54:28.195 --> 00:54:30.396]  They're finally really paying attention.

[00:55:12.661 --> 00:55:17.943]  I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country.
[00:55:17.943 --> 00:55:19.423]  Corporations have been enthroned.
[00:55:19.423 --> 00:55:20.764]  An era of corruption will follow.
[00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:30.027]  And the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic destroyed.
[00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:32.088]  Abraham Lincoln.
[00:55:32.088 --> 00:55:33.349]  That is the Money Masters, 1995.
[00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:36.270]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.

[00:55:40.791 --> 00:55:41.592]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:55:41.592 --> 00:55:45.393]  All these books and videos available at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:45.393 --> 00:55:47.254]  Get them, make copies, get them out to folks.
[00:55:48.655 --> 00:55:50.857]  Officer Jack McClam is a Vietnam veteran.
[00:55:50.857 --> 00:55:58.084]  He also, at the same time, was the most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix, Arizona history.
[00:55:58.084 --> 00:56:01.948]  Cop of the year twice, until he started refusing to go along with corruption.
[00:56:01.948 --> 00:56:05.211]  Then he became the most fired in Phoenix, Arizona history.
[00:56:05.211 --> 00:56:10.135]  And he has a weeknight show right here on the GCN radio network for an hour each evening.
[00:56:10.976 --> 00:56:16.340]  And I wanted to get him on for the next 30 minutes into the next hour, because it's all happening.
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:21.423]  FEMA camps, but they're telling us it's for your own good, it's for the illegal aliens, it's for emergencies.
[00:56:21.423 --> 00:56:23.165]  Yes, there'll be clergy response teams.
[00:56:23.165 --> 00:56:25.126]  Yes, we're teaching you to turn your guns in.
[00:56:25.126 --> 00:56:28.308]  Yes, we're introducing bills to ban guns and register what's left.
[00:56:28.308 --> 00:56:32.671]  Yes, we're going to have a World Central Bank that controls the United States.
[00:56:32.671 --> 00:56:34.352]  That's in Time Magazine today.
[00:56:35.333 --> 00:56:39.456]  In an article titled, The New World Order, they are clearly making their move.
[00:56:39.456 --> 00:56:44.579]  They have uncloaked themselves because they're going for broke and they're selling it as the solution.
[00:56:44.579 --> 00:56:59.929]  Jack, they're very arrogant all these decades having FBI training manuals saying it didn't exist and that we were dangerous schizophrenics and saying none of this was happening and there was no such thing as international banks and Limbaugh saying the CFR didn't exist, at least published under one of their imprints.
[00:56:59.929 --> 00:57:01.410]  Now they're uncloaking.
[00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:02.811]  What does this mean, Jack McClam?
[00:57:04.304 --> 00:57:07.986]  Well, they think that they're going to cut us off at the pass, brother.
[00:57:07.986 --> 00:57:19.173]  They, they're running for the goal line and, um, hope to cut us off at the pass before we awaken millions and millions of more Americans and overthrow them.
[00:57:19.173 --> 00:57:24.937]  So they're on a full out run and abomination.
[00:57:24.937 --> 00:57:31.361]  Our phony president, by the way, we haven't had, this is a time that we don't have a president of the United States.
[00:57:31.361 --> 00:57:32.582]  First time in our history.
[00:57:33.736 --> 00:57:50.383]  And because he's a phony president, we have all the evidence to prove that he's not our president, because of Article 2, Section 5 in the Constitution says he's not, because he's an illegal alien out of Kenya.
[00:57:50.383 --> 00:57:55.125]  And anyway, they think they have got it made.
[00:57:55.125 --> 00:58:02.428]  You know, they think they've got it made, they've got us, and they don't realize that God is still in control, as we do.
[00:58:03.416 --> 00:58:05.718]  But they think they got it made.
[00:58:05.718 --> 00:58:10.961]  They're really pleased to have the communist abomination in there now.
[00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:18.066]  He's a total puppet of the communist Zionist CFR.
[00:58:18.066 --> 00:58:24.390]  Did you see the cover of Time Magazine of Newsweek saying we're all socialists now?
[00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:25.591]  No.
[00:58:25.591 --> 00:58:27.032]  No, I didn't.
[00:58:27.032 --> 00:58:29.313]  No, I don't look at those magazines.
[00:58:29.313 --> 00:58:30.074]  I read about seven
[00:58:31.212 --> 00:58:32.514]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:52.475 --> 00:58:57.236]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.236 --> 00:59:00.197]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.197 --> 00:59:03.238]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.238 --> 00:59:07.960]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:09.302]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.302 --> 00:59:12.546]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.546 --> 00:59:19.556]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:59:39.977 --> 00:59:41.799]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.487 --> 00:59:55.889]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.889 --> 00:59:59.092]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:59.092 --> 01:00:05.257]  Initiate.
[01:00:05.257 --> 01:00:06.558]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.558 --> 01:00:08.339]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:10.081]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.081 --> 01:00:11.662]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.662 --> 01:00:13.243]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:17.427]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.427 --> 01:00:19.769]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.301]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.301 --> 01:00:25.802]  Now is not a time to screw around or sit down and be idle.
[01:00:25.802 --> 01:00:27.422]  This is history.
[01:00:27.422 --> 01:00:34.684]  This is literally the forces of evil, total control over everybody's lives, micromanagement, FEMA camps, gun confiscation.
[01:00:34.684 --> 01:00:37.065]  This is toe-to-toe combat with the new world order.
[01:00:38.683 --> 01:00:42.004]  And in their own words, they're the ones that funded Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[01:00:42.004 --> 01:00:44.285]  They killed over 200 million people in the 20th century.
[01:00:44.285 --> 01:00:47.066]  They planned mass exterminations in the United States.
[01:00:47.066 --> 01:00:51.007]  Now remember, we're the people that told you exactly how they'd pop the subprime mortgages before.
[01:00:51.007 --> 01:00:54.549]  We're the folks that told you how they'd roll out FEMA camps, exactly how they'd pitch them.
[01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:59.911]  We're the folks that told you they would announce that a world government was needed through banks that you'd pay your carbon taxes to.
[01:00:59.911 --> 01:01:01.511]  Exactly what we said happened.
[01:01:01.511 --> 01:01:03.712]  Everything we're telling you has been right.
[01:01:03.712 --> 01:01:06.113]  Now I'm telling you they want to murder you
[01:01:06.693 --> 01:01:07.994]  No, you're not joking, brother.
[01:01:07.994 --> 01:01:12.897]  I've read the documents themselves in a number of the works of the communist Zionists
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:41.826]  Who say that they're going to round up Christians and murder millions and millions of Christians.
[01:01:41.826 --> 01:01:48.372]  And so... And the clergy response teams, the clergy response teams, the clergy response teams are going to tell them to go into the camps.
[01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:48.973]  Go ahead.
[01:01:48.973 --> 01:01:49.653]  They've done that before.
[01:01:49.653 --> 01:01:50.334]  Go ahead.
[01:01:50.334 --> 01:01:59.402]  Well, we had in 1917, the Bolsheviks took over Russia and within the next few years, they slaughtered 66 million Christians.
[01:02:00.907 --> 01:02:03.349]  Because they hate Christians with a passion.
[01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:14.516]  They're anti-Christ, synagogue of Satan members, as God calls them in the Bible, as Jesus Christ calls them in Revelations 2.9.
[01:02:14.516 --> 01:02:20.379]  And these are communist Zionist Gentiles that call themselves Jews.
[01:02:20.379 --> 01:02:23.421]  And that's what Jesus said in Revelations 2.9.
[01:02:23.421 --> 01:02:27.904]  I know the blasphemy of them that say they're Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
[01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:32.693]  And that's exactly who took over Israel in 1948.
[01:02:32.693 --> 01:02:49.749]  They were not Jews, and now we have, praise God, we have five websites of Jews, millions and millions of Jews that are standing up with us against the synagogue of Satan, these Antichrist Gentiles that say they're Jews.
[01:02:50.758 --> 01:03:12.608]  And millions of Jews have gone on the web now, and on five websites that I have listed, because our wonderful police and soldier Jews contact me and ask me to put this on the air, because when they do it individually, they're murdered by Shin Bet and the Mossad, who works for the Communist Zionists.
[01:03:13.894 --> 01:03:23.764]  And we've had four of our publishers who publish books, writers that publish books that are Jewish that have been murdered by the Mossad and Shin Bet.
[01:03:30.131 --> 01:03:30.591]  That's right.
[01:03:30.591 --> 01:03:37.752]  Yes, it's not just the Communist, Zionist, Caesar, Gentiles that call themselves Jews, but it is the people you mentioned, the Queen of England and that dynasty,
[01:03:59.877 --> 01:04:19.593]  We have the Catholic Church, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, setting up the world religion, the Antichrist world religion, and we've got the Communist Zionists and their partners, a lot of them in this country too, the super-rich, that are setting up the political system for the Antichrist world government system.
[01:04:19.593 --> 01:04:23.857]  So, we're in deep trouble.
[01:04:23.857 --> 01:04:26.279]  And the reason for this, Alex, is because
[01:04:26.966 --> 01:04:32.570]  We've sat back for over 70 years now and let God be thrown out of this nation.
[01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.431]  There's nothing left.
[01:04:34.431 --> 01:04:38.534]  There's nothing left in our system today that is out of the scriptures.
[01:04:38.534 --> 01:04:39.694]  Nothing.
[01:04:39.694 --> 01:04:45.899]  And so, God is mad and he's bringing his enemies upon us to destroy us and enslave us.
[01:04:45.899 --> 01:04:54.964]  And if we can't awaken his people and get back on our knees before God and ask forgiveness for our national sins, then we're going down hard.
[01:04:54.964 --> 01:04:55.465]  Big time.
[01:04:56.308 --> 01:05:01.171]  Well, the globalists have sworn to kill at least half the American population, and we're not joking.
[01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:05.674]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:05:05.674 --> 01:05:10.778]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:05:10.778 --> 01:05:12.279]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:12.279 --> 01:05:13.540]  Why not go back to basics?
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:14.821]  We're good to go!
[01:05:41.901 --> 01:05:46.505]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:05:46.505 --> 01:05:48.987]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:53.391]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[01:05:53.391 --> 01:05:56.053]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091.
[01:05:56.053 --> 01:06:00.897]  5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:06:00.897 --> 01:06:07.642]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:07.642 --> 01:06:09.344]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:10.273 --> 01:06:11.814]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:11.814 --> 01:06:12.615]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.615 --> 01:06:13.596]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:13.596 --> 01:06:14.977]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:14.977 --> 01:06:16.959]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:16.959 --> 01:06:24.125]  Enabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:24.606]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:30.271]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:30.951 --> 01:06:34.453]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.453 --> 01:06:36.614]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:01.027 --> 01:07:04.532]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:07:04.532 --> 01:07:09.939]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:07:09.939 --> 01:07:14.645]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.

[01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:07.691]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:12.393]  Glenn Spencer's joining us in T-minus 25 minutes.
[01:08:15.196 --> 01:08:16.777]  We get into the border imploding.
[01:08:16.777 --> 01:08:19.159]  Mainstream news saying Mexico may collapse.
[01:08:19.159 --> 01:08:22.882]  FEMA camps being built now in the El Paso Times.
[01:08:22.882 --> 01:08:26.125]  Sheriff Richard Max coming on in an hour.
[01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:36.953]  Representative Jim Gaston, Missouri, getting into now 10 states moving to declare sovereignty saying nobody's going into FEMA camps and gun confiscation isn't going to be happening on their watch.
[01:08:36.953 --> 01:08:37.934]  The states will resist.
[01:08:39.304 --> 01:08:51.944]  Jack McClain, that is the good news, is that freedom-loving people of every race, religion, and creed are sick of the evil, sick of the banksters, and the globalists don't have a choice because we're exposing them.
[01:08:51.944 --> 01:08:53.687]  They're moving ahead and accelerating their plan.
[01:08:55.128 --> 01:09:12.755]  Specifically, what's your take on all these states moving, and bills we've been reading on air openly saying, and the state reps we've been having on, mainline state reps saying, yes, we know it's a new world order, we know they're building FEMA camps, we know they're planning gun confiscations, we know we're under martial law, we know they want to use the army against us.
[01:09:12.755 --> 01:09:19.277]  You know, one of these guys was an army officer, the state rep from Washington State, he knew all the history, had a degree in history, is aware of it.
[01:09:19.277 --> 01:09:21.218]  I mean, really, the knowledge
[01:09:22.018 --> 01:09:29.545]  ...is starting to come out everywhere, so we've got a good chance of fighting this if we just take action.
[01:09:29.545 --> 01:09:30.446]  That's right, brother.
[01:09:30.446 --> 01:09:41.736]  I'm just proud and pleased to hear that eight states have already filed for their reclaim their sovereignty against the federal takeover of the states and the counties.
[01:09:41.736 --> 01:09:47.221]  And 20, I guess 20 states are looking at it right now very closely.
[01:09:47.904 --> 01:10:15.892]  So we've got a chance of winning against these turkeys, brother, and it's a good thing, but our police, it's sad that when I was a police officer in the war zone of South Phoenix, the highest crime area, and was injured repeatedly down there because when I became a constitutionalist, the police chief firing me a number of times, I kept winning my job back because I went to the board
[01:10:16.576 --> 01:10:21.859]  The Civil Service Board, and they kept putting me back to work, so he decided to kill me.
[01:10:21.859 --> 01:10:31.024]  And he told all the department, 2,500 men and women under arms, that if Officer McClam calls for a backup, you don't go to his aid.
[01:10:31.024 --> 01:10:40.610]  And I worked five years like that and was finally injured in the line of duty and had to take a medical retirement, arresting a drug smuggler on a Sunday morning.
[01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:44.092]  But after I was in there,
[01:10:44.984 --> 01:10:55.330]  And I was a Christian and wrote about it in a police military newsletter on constitutional issues that they change the hiring practices.
[01:10:55.330 --> 01:11:00.373]  This has been 20 years ago, brother, to where they don't hire Christians anymore.
[01:11:00.373 --> 01:11:03.594]  If you're of high moral character and they ask you 600 questions,
[01:11:05.356 --> 01:11:08.938]  That you have to fill out a form answering 600 questions.
[01:11:08.938 --> 01:11:10.519]  Psychological tests, yeah.
[01:11:10.519 --> 01:11:15.322]  Yeah, and if you are of high moral character, they will not hire you.
[01:11:15.322 --> 01:11:25.629]  They want people they can manipulate, and they're hiring people with criminal records now, just like the military is hiring gang members now.
[01:11:25.629 --> 01:11:30.772]  And also, the military's hiring people with felony records now.
[01:11:31.423 --> 01:11:52.060]  Because they know that a lot of these people are going to be on the streets of America enforcing the military rule, the Soviet-style totalitarian military rule that's already set up by Communists Chertoff and Marcus Wolf, head of the East German Stasi, and Yugani Primakov, head of the KGB.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:58.606]  And they've got it all set up, and now they've hired this Bilderberger and CFR member
[01:11:59.127 --> 01:12:16.657]  Janet Napolitano, a lesbian governor of Arizona, to run it now, and so she's deeply embedded in a puppet of the CFR and the Bilderbergers, so I guess there won't be any change at all.
[01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:19.251]  With her at the helm.
[01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:21.052]  Getting back into the police.
[01:12:21.052 --> 01:12:22.573]  You know, I see these reports every day.
[01:12:22.573 --> 01:12:25.576]  One of the San Antonio Express News yesterday.
[01:12:25.576 --> 01:12:28.759]  The headline was, police stops piracy.
[01:12:28.759 --> 01:12:33.863]  And the police just pull you over, rob old ladies of cash out of their wallets, grab your watches.
[01:12:33.863 --> 01:12:37.346]  And they just do it on record and say, no judge, no jury, no arrest.
[01:12:37.346 --> 01:12:38.667]  And they just say they're going to continue.
[01:12:38.667 --> 01:12:43.732]  And all over the nation now, police departments are just robbing people under asset forfeiture seizure.
[01:12:44.592 --> 01:12:47.913]  You know, they pass law saying, not even an arrest, just steal everything you've got.
[01:12:47.913 --> 01:12:55.675]  And then the people call me going, well, our son's a police officer and we don't, you know, they're not all bad, Alex, you need to take it easy.
[01:12:55.675 --> 01:13:01.337]  What am I supposed to do when the leadership is evil, the leadership is corrupt?
[01:13:01.337 --> 01:13:10.259]  I know there's a lot of good police, I know, but the system itself is corrupt and works for an illegitimate federal government.
[01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:18.241]  And so, I mean, how do you explain this to people that, sorry police, you now work for the New World Order?
[01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:19.282]  And they say, well, what do we do?
[01:13:19.282 --> 01:13:19.942]  Get rid of the police?
[01:13:19.942 --> 01:13:20.782]  I'm not even saying that.
[01:13:20.782 --> 01:13:24.363]  I'm saying, bottom line, the country's been seized.
[01:13:24.363 --> 01:13:25.524]  It has, yes.
[01:13:25.524 --> 01:13:31.185]  And I was, my police chief, we watched this as I was a cop there.
[01:13:31.185 --> 01:13:39.728]  My other Christian police officer friends, and good moral character, not just Christian police officer friends, watched as the most evil
[01:13:40.969 --> 01:13:41.610]  I think so.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:05.861]  In control of the police agencies, federal, state, and local in the nation.
[01:14:05.861 --> 01:14:12.942]  And so that's why they changed the hiring practices to where they wouldn't hire anybody with a high moral character.
[01:14:12.942 --> 01:14:15.122]  They wanted them all to be criminals.
[01:14:15.122 --> 01:14:17.543]  And you can see that happening today.
[01:14:17.543 --> 01:14:27.345]  Officers stunning people to death with stun guns just because it's fun and shooting people because they want to shoot people because they make them mad.
[01:14:27.345 --> 01:14:30.045]  And so, and robbing people, like you say,
[01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:33.496]  But there are still good police officers out there.
[01:14:33.496 --> 01:14:58.355]  It's just we got to be very careful when we're pulled over by these officers because if you let out that you're a constitutionalist, they, they come up and they pull you out of the car and they call for a backup and one of them will fall down and fake that you pushed him down and scream and holler and all of them will swear that you pushed him down and that's a felony now.
[01:14:59.022 --> 01:14:59.642]  I don't know.
[01:15:23.214 --> 01:15:31.064]  And be our God and let us get back under His laws, His commandments and so forth that we've thrown out of this nation.
[01:15:31.064 --> 01:15:34.989]  And because it's just totally corrupt and satanic today, brother.
[01:15:40.091 --> 01:15:46.255]  Good cops will end up doing traffic duty, but the ones that are corrupt that show that they'll go along with evil, they get promoted.
[01:15:46.255 --> 01:15:55.181]  I've talked to former narcotics officers who say that on average, 85% of the narcotics officers they work with, that it is standard to plant drugs on people.
[01:15:55.181 --> 01:15:57.643]  And we have all the news reports confirming that.
[01:15:57.643 --> 01:16:02.246]  So what am I supposed to say about this system?
[01:16:02.246 --> 01:16:08.991]  We're just stating on record that it is terminally corrupt, and then now we see the banking takeover and all the corruption.
[01:16:10.948 --> 01:16:12.549]  I know it.
[01:16:12.549 --> 01:16:19.232]  But the thing is, we watch, too, as the most evil, corrupt prosecutors were promoted up.
[01:16:19.232 --> 01:16:25.415]  The criminal prosecutors were promoted up to judgeships so that you'd have criminal judges.
[01:16:25.415 --> 01:16:28.117]  And I'm not talking about criminal court judges.
[01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:35.901]  I'm talking about absolute criminals now that are judges in the federal system and many times in the state system.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:47.823]  They can railroad you or me or Chris Jones, for example, into prison anytime they want to by lying and making phony reports and everything.
[01:16:47.823 --> 01:16:51.484]  Ramos and Compion, they did the same thing to them.
[01:16:51.484 --> 01:16:54.805]  Because it's just absolutely under the hand of Satan today.
[01:16:58.035 --> 01:17:05.419]  We have to rise up in great numbers, brother, and I thank you, Alex, for reaching great numbers of our people.
[01:17:05.419 --> 01:17:06.940]  Well, Jack, here's another question.
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:15.105]  And reaching other great numbers of our people, because that's the only hope we have, is get back under God and our Constitution, our Republic.
[01:17:15.105 --> 01:17:22.109]  I've seen a lot of reports lately, one just a few days ago, where they busted a bunch of state judges in one state.
[01:17:22.109 --> 01:17:25.731]  If a child was late to class or shoved somebody, they would
[01:17:26.519 --> 01:17:39.128]  They would have tricked the parents into signing them over and then they were getting payoffs from the private juvenile detention centers in millions of dollars in some cases when one judge got seven hundred something thousand of the table.
[01:17:39.128 --> 01:17:40.009]  They were arrested.
[01:17:40.009 --> 01:17:42.071]  They've now pled guilty.
[01:17:42.071 --> 01:17:43.472]  But I see this all the time.
[01:17:43.472 --> 01:17:44.833]  I know they do that right here in Austin.
[01:17:45.843 --> 01:17:48.305]  Yeah, they do it in Florida, all over Florida.
[01:17:48.305 --> 01:18:02.533]  I mean, how widespread is this with the payoffs to judges to put people in jail from the prisons themselves, the private prisons, and I mean, how many police would you say from your studies lie on the stand?
[01:18:02.533 --> 01:18:12.179]  Well, sadly, now that they've switched their hiring system to where they hire nobody with high moral character, almost all of them lie on the witness stand.
[01:18:12.179 --> 01:18:13.020]  There is some good
[01:18:13.686 --> 01:18:18.908]  Christian police officers that are still there trying to hang on by the skin of their teeth.
[01:18:18.908 --> 01:18:31.173]  But it's so corrupt and so evil that many of them are bailing out because they just can't take the corrupt and the evil and the criminal system that they have to work in today.
[01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:36.075]  So they're weeding out the good officers, brother, and good soldiers, too.
[01:18:36.075 --> 01:18:37.655]  Same thing in the military.
[01:18:37.655 --> 01:18:41.697]  That's why Pat Tillman was killed, because he was going to come back and tell the truth.
[01:18:42.501 --> 01:18:55.165]  About what he saw there in Afghanistan about us planting 30 times now the poppy fields that the Taliban destroyed there.
[01:18:55.165 --> 01:19:02.708]  And so we had to go in and kill off the Taliban and take over that land to replant 30 times now the poppy fields.
[01:19:02.708 --> 01:19:05.889]  And Pat Tillman, his brother, says, knew that.
[01:19:06.488 --> 01:19:06.568]  It's
[01:19:30.715 --> 01:19:44.858]  In the part of the Middle East that she was in, and the next couple days she shot herself, allegedly committed suicide with her army rifle, shooting herself in the head, which we know was not true of course.
[01:19:44.858 --> 01:19:54.261]  So if you stand up and tell the truth in law enforcement today, you're in deep trouble with the evil administration.
[01:19:54.261 --> 01:19:59.242]  And it's only intensifying, all so the bankers can steal everything, including your pension funds, police.
[01:20:01.252 --> 01:20:04.494]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[01:20:04.494 --> 01:20:06.835]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:10.437]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:20:10.437 --> 01:20:11.377]  Be smart.
[01:20:11.377 --> 01:20:12.358]  Be safe.
[01:20:12.358 --> 01:20:14.539]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:22:07.353 --> 01:22:10.415]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:22:10.415 --> 01:22:13.256]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:22:13.256 --> 01:22:16.018]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:22:16.018 --> 01:22:19.220]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:26.544]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[01:22:42.618 --> 01:22:43.399]  They're not after money.
[01:22:43.399 --> 01:22:44.680]  They have all the money they need.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.640]  They're after power.

[01:23:00.379 --> 01:23:10.947]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[01:23:33.598 --> 01:23:34.298]  Fresh.

[01:24:17.225 --> 01:24:20.767]  Final segment with Officer Jack McClam.
[01:24:20.767 --> 01:24:23.868]  I've got a few final questions for you, Officer.
[01:24:23.868 --> 01:24:30.432]  But before we do that, I met you before, interviewed you probably a hundred times over the last...
[01:24:31.325 --> 01:24:32.526]  Thirteen years I've been on air.
[01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:38.729]  But we're in a film together called The New World Order, and I think it's going to be the first mainstream fair film.
[01:24:38.729 --> 01:24:39.389]  I've seen it.
[01:24:39.389 --> 01:24:44.311]  It's going to be on Independent Film Channel in about four months.
[01:24:44.311 --> 01:24:49.794]  It's the main selection for a bunch of top film festivals like South by Southwest.
[01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:53.836]  And getting a chance to see your office, let's just say it's extremely humble.
[01:24:54.930 --> 01:25:01.613]  And I just think it's very important for people to support you and your important work.
[01:25:01.613 --> 01:25:12.938]  I know you have a lot of health problems now, and seeing that in the film, because I haven't seen you in person in years, and I just know how much you work every day, Jack, so I hope people will support you, my friend.
[01:25:12.938 --> 01:25:22.382]  Well, it would be good, brother, because we're struggling here to reach our police and soldiers as fast as we can, and we've always prayed
[01:25:22.915 --> 01:25:23.275]  I don't know.
[01:25:45.177 --> 01:25:58.206]  Come forward, and we'd love to, at this time, be able to do that kind of a mail-out, but we're all volunteers here, and every penny comes in goes to educate our police and soldiers.
[01:25:58.206 --> 01:26:01.509]  How many years have you been doing this?
[01:26:01.509 --> 01:26:02.850]  29 years now.
[01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:07.393]  And what, you operate on a budget of $20,000 a year?
[01:26:07.393 --> 01:26:09.154]  Oh, probably, yeah.
[01:26:09.154 --> 01:26:12.737]  I would say probably that, or maybe even less, you know?
[01:26:13.177 --> 01:26:21.344]  Well, what you've done with Operation Vampire Killer and, you know, police and military passing those out to people has just been innumerable.
[01:26:21.344 --> 01:26:23.246]  But yes, people should get your information out.
[01:26:23.246 --> 01:26:24.547]  They should support you.
[01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:26.708]  Fire out your address for folks.
[01:26:26.708 --> 01:26:28.350]  Okay, yes.
[01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:30.932]  First of all, my website is easy to find.
[01:26:30.932 --> 01:26:36.757]  It's Police and Military Against the New World Order, but it's easy to find by just putting triple W dot.
[01:26:37.515 --> 01:26:52.462]  Jack McLamb, and you don't spell my name Clam, it's Lamb, L-A-M-B, M-C, capital L-A-M-B, just like a lamb, dot com, or I'm sorry, dot org, dot org.
[01:26:52.462 --> 01:26:54.322]  JackMcLamb.org.
[01:26:54.322 --> 01:26:54.583]  Yeah.
[01:26:54.583 --> 01:26:56.783]  JackMcLamb.org.
[01:26:56.783 --> 01:27:04.607]  And you'll go right to Police and Military Against the New World Order website, and we have our address in there and our phone number in there.
[01:27:05.855 --> 01:27:14.923]  And even a copy of Operation Vampire Killer 2000 is up on the website now, and it's been fantastic.
[01:27:14.923 --> 01:27:29.675]  Two and a half million copies or more of Vampire Killer 2000 have gone out over the years, and we've kept the price down to where we're just barely paying the printer for it.
[01:27:30.269 --> 01:27:48.274]  And we've had police officers call us up and say, my gosh, I didn't know all this was happening because we use the quotes of Prime Ministers, Presidents, Supreme Court Justices and all around the world that they knew the names of and put their actual quotes in there about the New World Order.
[01:27:48.274 --> 01:27:52.695]  And so after they read that 75 pages, they call us or write to us and say,
[01:27:53.374 --> 01:27:54.155]  I never knew.
[01:27:54.155 --> 01:27:55.876]  I was up all last night.
[01:27:55.876 --> 01:28:00.420]  You made me lose a whole night of sleep when I started reading that book.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:14.072]  So, praise God, it's had a great effect on people, just like the Lord has used you in a mighty way, brother Alex, and we thank the Lord for using you in a mighty way, brother, as he's using you today.
[01:28:15.816 --> 01:28:25.643]  Well, it is a great responsibility, and Jack, we just appreciate your 29 years of front-line service against the globalists.
[01:28:25.643 --> 01:28:28.645]  You're one of the people that the seeds you planted have grown.
[01:28:30.330 --> 01:28:37.573]  A huge harvest of people unlocking their minds and souls to the truth of what's developing, and certainly we are not in boring times.
[01:28:37.573 --> 01:28:45.536]  These are very interesting, very dangerous, very serious times, and all that evil needs to triumph is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:28:45.536 --> 01:28:46.896]  And folks, we're not kidding.
[01:28:46.896 --> 01:28:51.698]  This is the most virulent, hardcore, vicious, slimy, stinking corruption
[01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:53.639]  That you can even imagine.
[01:28:53.639 --> 01:29:05.724]  I study it every day and I cannot believe the depths of it, the depravity, the wickedness, their hatred of innocence, their hatred of children, their hatred of honor, their hatred of everything wholesome.
[01:29:05.724 --> 01:29:06.424]  And we're right.
[01:29:06.424 --> 01:29:07.345]  And again,
[01:29:07.665 --> 01:29:08.826]  Everything we've said came true.
[01:29:08.826 --> 01:29:09.786]  We've been right all along.
[01:29:09.786 --> 01:29:12.508]  Folks, do not say you weren't warned.
[01:29:12.508 --> 01:29:18.552]  You know, God has put people out there like Jack McLam and others so that you were at least given a warning.
[01:29:18.552 --> 01:29:20.653]  And just don't ignore that warning.
[01:29:20.653 --> 01:29:21.934]  If you do, it's at your own peril.
[01:29:21.934 --> 01:29:23.355]  We love you all.
[01:29:23.355 --> 01:29:26.017]  And take us out with saying this old cop dearly loves you.
[01:29:27.074 --> 01:29:31.937]  Yes, brothers and sisters out there, this old cop really does love you.
[01:29:31.937 --> 01:29:35.518]  You're my brothers and sisters, and I pray for you every night.
[01:29:35.518 --> 01:29:41.321]  God bless all of you out there, and thanks to you, Alex, for all you do for America and the world.
[01:29:41.321 --> 01:29:43.042]  We love you, brother, Alex.
[01:29:43.042 --> 01:29:44.083]  We love you too, Jack.
[01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:44.923]  Take care, my friend.
[01:29:44.923 --> 01:29:46.704]  Okay, take care now.
[01:29:46.704 --> 01:29:47.064]  You bet.
[01:29:47.064 --> 01:29:51.366]  JackMcLamb.org.
[01:29:51.366 --> 01:29:52.767]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.767 --> 01:29:54.268]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.978]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:09.797]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[01:30:09.797 --> 01:30:11.398]  You need the Paclite!
[01:30:11.398 --> 01:30:19.646]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[01:30:19.646 --> 01:30:23.189]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:28.033]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[01:30:28.033 --> 01:30:29.294]  The Paclite is so durable,
[01:30:29.554 --> 01:30:34.377]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[01:30:34.377 --> 01:30:39.061]  The Pack Light comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.

[01:30:54.271 --> 01:31:07.999]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:07.999 --> 01:31:09.660]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:12.194]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:12.194 --> 01:31:12.975]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:12.975 --> 01:31:13.976]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:13.976 --> 01:31:15.358]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.358 --> 01:31:17.340]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:24.508]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.508 --> 01:31:24.989]  Some U.S.
[01:31:24.989 --> 01:31:30.656]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.326 --> 01:31:34.828]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:34.828 --> 01:31:37.630]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:02.216 --> 01:32:03.737]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:32:03.737 --> 01:32:05.118]  eFoods does it again.

[01:32:10.242 --> 01:32:18.889]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.

[01:32:41.617 --> 01:32:45.039]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[01:32:45.039 --> 01:32:48.601]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[01:32:48.601 --> 01:32:51.342]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:51.342 --> 01:32:53.564]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:33:12.341 --> 01:33:13.242]  Sometimes Satan!
[01:33:13.242 --> 01:33:15.223]  Well, first he's in the
[01:33:40.976 --> 01:33:44.678]  I just picture Barack Obama here.
[01:33:44.678 --> 01:33:50.642]  Yeah, you know, Bush, he's a little devil, but not a slick devil.
[01:34:05.848 --> 01:34:11.570]  That's what Albert Speer, the German economy minister, said about Hitler.
[01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:22.092]  He said, you didn't realize that somebody was the devil when they had their arm around you, smiling at you.
[01:34:22.092 --> 01:34:26.573]  Not even the chief of police.
[01:34:26.573 --> 01:34:29.774]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:34:29.774 --> 01:34:31.815]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:34:33.291 --> 01:34:45.273]  Glenn Spencer is one of the preeminent researchers and activists living on the Arizona border tracking the attempt of the North American Union crowd to sacrifice the United States on the altar of globalism.
[01:34:45.273 --> 01:34:51.355]  And he said for more than a decade that Mexico was going to fall to open rebellion because it's a narco-terrorist state.
[01:34:51.355 --> 01:34:57.716]  There are tens of thousands of murders in the last year alone in Mexico and many of those thousands on the border.
[01:34:58.456 --> 01:34:58.816]  I think?
[01:35:16.584 --> 01:35:22.112]  This is out of the El Paso Times, linked up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:22.112 --> 01:35:28.862]  It gets into all of that, saying yes, Mexico, the State Department saying may fall, Homeland Security saying it.
[01:35:30.305 --> 01:35:32.726]  This is just unbelievable what's going on.
[01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:47.915]  One of the most corrupt and dangerous nations in the world just virulently nationalistic against the United States and the SPP crowd, North American Union crowd, said they're going to use this crisis to merge the nations and that's now official mainstream news after all the denials.
[01:35:47.915 --> 01:35:50.676]  Glenn Spencer, it's great to have you on with us.
[01:35:50.676 --> 01:35:52.697]  Good to talk to you again.
[01:35:52.697 --> 01:35:54.438]  It has been a little while since we had you on.
[01:35:54.438 --> 01:35:55.839]  A lot of new developments.
[01:35:55.839 --> 01:35:57.820]  Please give us your breakdown on what's happening.
[01:35:59.076 --> 01:36:09.321]  Well, you know Alex, I moved out of California down here to the border about seven years ago and set about to tell the truth about the border to the American people.
[01:36:09.321 --> 01:36:19.846]  We developed a new technology, we developed our own unmanned aerial vehicles, we were sending live video from that UAV out over the internet showing what was going on.
[01:36:19.846 --> 01:36:25.028]  And we had great hopes in October of 2006 when the President signed the Secure Fence Act.
[01:36:25.748 --> 01:36:32.450]  Which called, really, for over 800 miles of double-layered fence to be built along the border.
[01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:35.251]  And what happened after that was amazing.
[01:36:35.251 --> 01:36:39.872]  I'm going to tell you how it is linked in a minute to what the war going on in Mexico.
[01:36:39.872 --> 01:36:43.413]  And I'm going to tell you something that nobody's heard before.
[01:36:43.413 --> 01:36:47.794]  But after he signed that bill, I knew that they weren't serious.
[01:36:47.794 --> 01:36:50.375]  So I launched what I called Operation Beef.
[01:36:50.375 --> 01:36:54.496]  If they're going to beef up the border, we're going to ask, where's the beef?
[01:36:55.168 --> 01:36:56.928]  So I bought a Cessna 206.
[01:36:56.928 --> 01:36:58.789]  I'm a pilot.
[01:36:58.789 --> 01:37:04.490]  I started flying the border for American Border Patrol in, actually, August of 2006.
[01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:10.472]  And we've been going along that border every two months and documenting what they're doing.
[01:37:10.472 --> 01:37:21.475]  Now, in December of 2007, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchins pulled a fast one and modified the Secure Fence Act, giving the Department of Homeland Security
[01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:26.711]  Total discretion over where to build the fence.
[01:37:26.711 --> 01:37:29.954]  Nobody knows about this because it hasn't been publicized.
[01:37:29.954 --> 01:37:33.517]  So they gave turd off, veto power over the fence.
[01:37:33.517 --> 01:37:38.441]  Now this original Secure Fence Act was passed by 67% of the House of Representatives.
[01:37:41.641 --> 01:37:44.443]  82% of the Senate and signed by the President.
[01:37:44.443 --> 01:37:59.828]  Glenn, just to back you up and interrupt here, I did see blurbs and congressional statements but it was not highly publicized that Chertoff took over the fence and started all this virtual fence talk and then had illegal aliens build a few little things that wouldn't keep anything from going through.
[01:37:59.828 --> 01:38:00.529]  Go ahead.
[01:38:00.529 --> 01:38:05.430]  Well, we started documenting this and blowing the whistle on what was going on.
[01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:09.512]  And the heat got on them a little bit because I put out a video that shows
[01:38:11.263 --> 01:38:15.405]  Our information was getting out there, even though there's a blackout on what we do.
[01:38:15.405 --> 01:38:17.427]  So they started building the fence.
[01:38:17.427 --> 01:38:24.551]  And in the middle of last year, I think Chertoff got religion and started putting up some serious fence.
[01:38:24.551 --> 01:38:28.374]  Most of what they put up, they're calling a fence, is what they call a vehicle barrier.
[01:38:28.374 --> 01:38:31.195]  You can either walk through it or step over it.
[01:38:31.195 --> 01:38:32.937]  And they're using little ramps.
[01:38:32.937 --> 01:38:34.698]  Trucks can drive right over it.
[01:38:34.698 --> 01:38:36.339]  So it really isn't a barrier.
[01:38:36.339 --> 01:38:38.380]  There's a lot of lying going on.
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:39.721]  But we found something out.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:47.343]  They have about 526 miles of combination of fence and vehicle barrier along the border.
[01:38:47.343 --> 01:38:55.266]  Now it turns out, where they really got serious was along the Goldwater bombing range in Texas.
[01:38:55.266 --> 01:38:59.148]  And they built about 50 miles of actual fence.
[01:38:59.148 --> 01:39:02.829]  And we flew this bombing range.
[01:39:02.829 --> 01:39:08.532]  Actually, I figured out a way to fly along this bombing range, which is right on the Mexican border for 50 miles.
[01:39:09.445 --> 01:39:14.947]  You can't fly over it because the top of the bombing range restricted area is 80,000 feet.
[01:39:14.947 --> 01:39:16.408]  So I had to figure out a way.
[01:39:16.408 --> 01:39:22.611]  How am I going to get some video of the border and that bombing range where it meets Mexico?
[01:39:22.611 --> 01:39:31.334]  I got permission from the FAA to launch out of here in eastern Arizona and fly along the border in Mexico.
[01:39:31.334 --> 01:39:32.835]  Right along the border.
[01:39:32.835 --> 01:39:35.076]  And they gave me a radar code and everything.
[01:39:35.558 --> 01:39:42.761]  As long as I landed in the Yuma and checked in with the Customs and Border Protection.
[01:39:42.761 --> 01:39:43.662]  So guess what?
[01:39:43.662 --> 01:39:51.025]  We started flying along the border a couple years ago, in Mexico, videotaping that border.
[01:39:51.025 --> 01:39:55.207]  You couldn't believe what we saw.
[01:39:55.207 --> 01:40:02.991]  I am telling you, there is Mexican Highway 2, runs 700 feet south of the border, parallels the border, okay?
[01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:17.020]  Thousands of tire, of vehicle, two tracks, coming right off of Mexican Highway 2, driving right onto the bombing range!
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:18.821]  There wasn't a fence!
[01:40:18.821 --> 01:40:21.904]  It was documented, all of this, in high-definition video.
[01:40:21.904 --> 01:40:23.125]  There was no fence!
[01:40:23.125 --> 01:40:26.728]  There was no trespassing signs!
[01:40:26.728 --> 01:40:29.330]  That's where all the drugs were coming through!
[01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:31.752]  Right across the bombing range!
[01:40:31.752 --> 01:40:33.253]  And our government knew it!
[01:40:34.778 --> 01:40:39.001]  So what happened was, we really put the pressure on him.
[01:40:39.001 --> 01:40:42.244]  The information got out.
[01:40:42.244 --> 01:40:46.467]  And suddenly, Chertoff put this fence up.
[01:40:46.467 --> 01:40:55.313]  And some other places, you know, especially between Yuma and Calexico, out in the desert, which we were blowing the whistle on, where there were running drugs through there.
[01:40:55.313 --> 01:40:57.795]  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[01:40:57.795 --> 01:41:00.697]  I'm going to tell you why there's a drug war going on in Mexico.
[01:41:03.732 --> 01:41:08.994]  We blocked off some of their major corridors.
[01:41:08.994 --> 01:41:14.076]  Now, you can go on AmericanPatrol.com, and you can see a chart back there.
[01:41:14.076 --> 01:41:15.797]  We drew a chart.
[01:41:15.797 --> 01:41:19.678]  We're the only ones who know how much fence was put in each year.
[01:41:19.678 --> 01:41:24.340]  We're the only people in the world who are flying the border watching what they were doing.
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.141]  And you can draw a chart.
[01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:32.343]  As they added fence, the drug killings in Mexico go up.
[01:41:32.711 --> 01:41:34.273]  There's a perfect parallel.
[01:41:34.273 --> 01:41:36.775]  The charts just march right along.
[01:41:36.775 --> 01:41:40.299]  What is going on?
[01:41:40.299 --> 01:41:46.285]  As we began to choke off those corridors, there were fewer places left.
[01:41:46.285 --> 01:41:49.308]  And they started fighting over them.
[01:41:49.308 --> 01:41:51.630]  That's what caused the drug war in Mexico.
[01:41:52.691 --> 01:41:59.573]  Well, I mean, I certainly think it's safe to say it's added to all of it, but also the funding election and the social pressures.
[01:41:59.573 --> 01:42:01.213]  You look at the other evidence.
[01:42:01.213 --> 01:42:03.474]  You take that same chart.
[01:42:03.474 --> 01:42:07.295]  We started with 100 miles of border fence and barriers in 2005.
[01:42:07.295 --> 01:42:07.535]  100 miles.
[01:42:07.535 --> 01:42:10.116]  By the end of 2008, we had almost 550 miles.
[01:42:10.116 --> 01:42:11.756]  They had 100 drug killings in Mexico in 2005, right?
[01:42:19.147 --> 01:42:21.488]  Go up to 2008, they had over 5,000.
[01:42:21.488 --> 01:42:25.449]  It's actually over 10,000, the numbers I've seen now.
[01:42:25.449 --> 01:42:32.771]  Well, the numbers that I have from the Border Patrol, the retired Border Patrol, is 5,500 or something like that.
[01:42:32.771 --> 01:42:33.512]  But it may be over 10,000.
[01:42:33.512 --> 01:42:42.194]  Yeah, they always use old numbers, but yes, it was 10 months into last year, it was 8,400, and then I saw thousands more now.
[01:42:42.194 --> 01:42:45.295]  Regardless of how that jumps up and down, also, in 2005,
[01:42:48.446 --> 01:42:55.469]  They eradicated something like 2 million some-odd thousand marijuana plants north of the border.
[01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:58.971]  By 2008, it was over 6 million.
[01:42:58.971 --> 01:43:00.952]  So what they're doing, they're getting desperate.
[01:43:00.952 --> 01:43:03.873]  They're trying to grow this stuff north of the border.
[01:43:03.873 --> 01:43:07.835]  They're flying ultralights over the fence.
[01:43:07.835 --> 01:43:11.016]  And crash, one guy crashed over by human, killed him.
[01:43:11.016 --> 01:43:12.517]  They're flying ultralights.
[01:43:12.517 --> 01:43:13.697]  They're trying to dig tunnels.
[01:43:13.697 --> 01:43:15.498]  But forget about tunnels, let me tell you something.
[01:43:15.498 --> 01:43:16.939]  I know the border better than anybody.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:18.641]  They can't dig tunnels.
[01:43:18.641 --> 01:43:22.163]  There's no place for it to emerge, to pop out in the U.S.
[01:43:22.163 --> 01:43:23.063]  side.
[01:43:23.063 --> 01:43:28.166]  Between El Paso, and don't ever try to dig a tunnel under the Rio Grande River, you'll die.
[01:43:28.166 --> 01:43:35.991]  Between El Paso and the San Diego coast, there are probably 100 places where you could have a tunnel pop up on the U.S.
[01:43:35.991 --> 01:43:36.131]  side.
[01:43:36.131 --> 01:43:37.912]  Well, they find them all the time.
[01:43:37.912 --> 01:43:40.253]  They found 17 last year.
[01:43:40.253 --> 01:43:40.594]  They found 17.
[01:43:42.805 --> 01:43:44.288]  Forget about tunnels.
[01:43:44.288 --> 01:43:46.572]  You cannot... Yeah, they got them in Nogales.
[01:43:46.572 --> 01:43:48.416]  We know where they find them.
[01:43:48.416 --> 01:43:51.341]  The places are so limited where they can do that.
[01:43:51.341 --> 01:43:53.185]  That's why they're getting so desperate!
[01:43:54.022 --> 01:43:56.044]  Alright, let's stop.
[01:43:56.044 --> 01:44:08.534]  I understand, exactly, we need to build a complete fence, but expanding on that, the overview of Mexico destabilized, the United States destabilized, is it true that the illegal aliens are going home en masse?
[01:44:08.534 --> 01:44:12.217]  I've seen some evidence of that, but not that much I was about to add.
[01:44:12.217 --> 01:44:15.319]  There is some anecdotal evidence.
[01:44:15.319 --> 01:44:16.500]  We don't see it.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.161]  They're still trying to get in.
[01:44:18.161 --> 01:44:23.706]  They caught a group of 70 a couple of days ago, about 5 miles from where I'm sitting.
[01:44:24.244 --> 01:44:25.625]  We're coming through.
[01:44:25.625 --> 01:44:28.987]  We have a 40-mile fence along the border where I am right now.
[01:44:28.987 --> 01:44:33.530]  There is a quarter-mile gap in it where the river is.
[01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:35.211]  That's my ranch.
[01:44:35.211 --> 01:44:36.992]  I'm looking at it right now.
[01:44:36.992 --> 01:44:39.073]  We're building a tower right there.
[01:44:39.073 --> 01:44:41.535]  We should have it finished by Monday.
[01:44:41.535 --> 01:44:48.579]  We're building a tower to put a thermal camera and look right down in that river to shut these people off because we're getting hundreds come through every night.
[01:44:48.579 --> 01:44:49.640]  They're still coming through.
[01:44:50.828 --> 01:44:51.869]  They're still coming through.
[01:44:51.869 --> 01:44:55.611]  Well, that's the question I wanted to ask you.
[01:44:55.611 --> 01:45:02.636]  Have you seen the El Paso Times talking about Mexico collapsing and millions more flooding across?
[01:45:02.636 --> 01:45:04.297]  I saw that.
[01:45:04.297 --> 01:45:07.499]  I saw it, but I want to tell you something.
[01:45:07.499 --> 01:45:09.740]  I don't trust Rick Perry.
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:11.641]  He's the governor of Texas.
[01:45:11.641 --> 01:45:13.943]  Oh, it's all talk, yeah.
[01:45:13.943 --> 01:45:17.545]  But he came out a couple of years ago dead set against the border fence.
[01:45:19.130 --> 01:45:23.191]  He was dead set against ending the practice of anchor babies.
[01:45:23.191 --> 01:45:24.291]  Okay?
[01:45:24.291 --> 01:45:27.372]  He's all for this NAFTA highway.
[01:45:27.372 --> 01:45:31.754]  He talks immigration enforcement, but only those who have committed other crimes.
[01:45:31.754 --> 01:45:33.394]  No, he's a Bilderberg Globalist.
[01:45:33.394 --> 01:45:34.334]  He's horrible.
[01:45:34.334 --> 01:45:34.834]  Absolutely.
[01:45:34.834 --> 01:45:42.537]  So when he starts talking about, oh, we're going to get ready for a thrust across the border, he's going to probably love it.
[01:45:42.537 --> 01:45:43.577]  But don't trust that guy.
[01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:46.899]  No, I know that.
[01:45:46.899 --> 01:45:47.319]  I know that.
[01:45:47.319 --> 01:45:52.160]  They're using it as a cover, according to Rex84, to build federal detention camps for the American people.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.161]  And Glenn, that's now introduced in Congress and in the mainstream news.
[01:45:55.161 --> 01:45:57.922]  They have built camps for the American people.
[01:45:57.922 --> 01:45:59.942]  They're probably going to put a spot in there for me!
[01:45:59.942 --> 01:46:00.963]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:46:00.963 --> 01:46:04.843]  A, what's going on with the camps, Northcom, in your expert analysis?
[01:46:04.843 --> 01:46:07.944]  And B, what is on the Obama agenda?
[01:46:07.944 --> 01:46:15.346]  Because the SPP has said, as you know, they want to use border crises as a way to just legalize everybody, to say, oh, we've got to document everybody.
[01:46:16.092 --> 01:46:16.772]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:46:16.772 --> 01:46:20.855]  But what's going on right now is with this bailout program.
[01:46:20.855 --> 01:46:21.656]  Okay?
[01:46:21.656 --> 01:46:26.038]  This is a great paper over the illegal immigration problem.
[01:46:26.038 --> 01:46:33.023]  They are going to send billions of dollars, I mean tens of billions of dollars, especially to California.
[01:46:33.023 --> 01:46:37.206]  And I have this on my website, AmericanPatrol.com, and I've been warning about this.
[01:46:37.206 --> 01:46:39.467]  Because California is bankrupt.
[01:46:39.467 --> 01:46:42.129]  Illegal immigration has bankrupted California.
[01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:43.950]  It can't even pay its people.
[01:46:44.562 --> 01:46:46.629]  It's laying its civil servants off.
[01:46:47.199 --> 01:46:56.321]  People, they say they have to, you know what, they just had a federal panel of federal judges told them they have to reduce their prison size by 40 percent?
[01:46:56.321 --> 01:46:59.521]  They have to send almost 60,000 criminals out into the streets?
[01:46:59.521 --> 01:47:15.184]  Yeah, for those that don't know, in Texas and California, it is tens of billions of dollars, conservatively, and over the years even more, for the states to pay for the free health care of the illegal aliens with the babies, the housing, the multiple identities and the welfare.
[01:47:16.064 --> 01:47:18.786]  So people that say this is contributing, it's the opposite.
[01:47:18.786 --> 01:47:19.926]  It's bankrupting the states.
[01:47:19.926 --> 01:47:20.767]  Go ahead.
[01:47:20.767 --> 01:47:23.328]  This is why California is bankrupt.
[01:47:23.328 --> 01:47:25.509]  But you have to understand what just happened.
[01:47:25.509 --> 01:47:29.191]  They were debating this whole thing back in Congress, and that's what the whole issue was over.
[01:47:29.191 --> 01:47:31.113]  It's illegal immigration.
[01:47:31.113 --> 01:47:32.293]  But now guess what?
[01:47:32.293 --> 01:47:37.836]  The governor, the mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villarigosa, okay?
[01:47:37.836 --> 01:47:39.917]  He is a reconquista of the highest order.
[01:47:39.917 --> 01:47:42.419]  He's here to turn California over to Mexico.
[01:47:43.061 --> 01:47:48.805]  He has contacted the Obama Administration and told them to send any stimulus money directly to him!
[01:47:48.805 --> 01:47:50.646]  Now this is it!
[01:47:50.646 --> 01:47:52.308]  This is it!
[01:47:52.308 --> 01:47:52.788]  The Hill!
[01:47:52.788 --> 01:47:53.829]  The newspaper, The Hill!
[01:47:53.829 --> 01:48:02.755]  Yeah, Bloomberg's reporting $2 billion to go to MoveOn and Acorn and others, so they're just going to take... Oh yeah, to all these people!
[01:48:02.755 --> 01:48:05.537]  You know, this is the Saul Alinsky Group!
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.741]  You know, this is where these people come from.
[01:48:08.741 --> 01:48:09.901]  These are open borders.
[01:48:09.901 --> 01:48:14.083]  Saul Alinsky, who wrote the foreword to his book, Thanking Satan.
[01:48:14.083 --> 01:48:15.203]  Lucifer.
[01:48:15.203 --> 01:48:16.804]  Yeah.
[01:48:16.804 --> 01:48:22.006]  So what you're seeing, the struggle going on, even as we speak right now.
[01:48:22.006 --> 01:48:27.448]  Billions and billions of dollars are going to be coming out to bail out these illegal alien states because
[01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:34.394]  Because remember, California is bankrupt, sending 60,000 people out of the prisons because of illegal aliens.
[01:48:34.394 --> 01:48:36.595]  Meanwhile, nursing homes are evicting the elderly.
[01:48:36.595 --> 01:48:38.376]  We have a story on Infowars.com.
[01:48:38.376 --> 01:48:39.577]  Absolutely!
[01:48:39.577 --> 01:48:44.980]  Because these people are going to...Obama cannot afford this to happen.
[01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:50.043]  Because eventually, they're going to...people are going to... He cannot allow that to happen.
[01:48:50.043 --> 01:48:51.744]  Well, they knew this bankruptcy was coming.
[01:48:56.155 --> 01:49:00.037]  We're racing to get total amnesty two years ago, but failed.
[01:49:00.037 --> 01:49:03.419]  I warned about this 16 years ago.
[01:49:03.419 --> 01:49:05.660]  I said we were importing poverty.
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:09.282]  I coined that phrase in California.
[01:49:09.282 --> 01:49:12.144]  16 years ago, I knew this was going to happen.
[01:49:12.144 --> 01:49:16.866]  That state is finished.
[01:49:16.866 --> 01:49:18.147]  And Obama knows it.
[01:49:19.113 --> 01:49:25.876]  And again, all these mainline liberals, all these mainline liberals, you know, we're not even against the poor Mexican people.
[01:49:25.876 --> 01:49:27.017]  We know they're in a desperate situation.
[01:49:27.017 --> 01:49:42.485]  The point is, you take hundreds of millions of third world people from all over the planet, mainly Mexico being 80 plus percent of the illegal aliens, you take 30 million of them in here, it will bankrupt things, and so all these liberals are going to lose their teaching pension funds, their cop funds, all these people that went for this,
[01:49:43.769 --> 01:49:45.972]  Understand, folks, this is what you wanted.
[01:49:45.972 --> 01:49:48.194]  You wanted to be Mexico City, and now you're going to be.
[01:49:48.194 --> 01:49:48.835]  Go ahead.
[01:49:48.835 --> 01:49:49.516]  We do.
[01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:51.839]  That's why they call it the Left Coast.
[01:49:51.839 --> 01:49:55.063]  California is the most liberal state of the Union.
[01:49:55.063 --> 01:49:58.827]  And how California goes to the rest of the Union, as they say?
[01:49:58.827 --> 01:50:01.150]  It is bankrupt.
[01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:02.672]  It is totally broke.
[01:50:03.743 --> 01:50:09.225]  It has the worst bond rating of any state in the union below Louisiana.
[01:50:09.225 --> 01:50:10.565]  They're saying they're already bankrupt.
[01:50:10.565 --> 01:50:14.087]  They're already having to go into debt just to pay the paychecks.
[01:50:14.087 --> 01:50:16.207]  They're finished today.
[01:50:16.207 --> 01:50:19.828]  That's why they're so desperate to get Congress to bail them out.
[01:50:19.828 --> 01:50:23.810]  And that's what the struggle is over this Senate versus House version.
[01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:28.111]  And the Congress is going to loot the American people of their tax money regardless of what color they are.
[01:50:28.111 --> 01:50:31.192]  Of course they are, but it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with race.
[01:50:31.192 --> 01:50:33.273]  This has stuff to do with legality.
[01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:34.012]  Yes.
[01:50:34.012 --> 01:50:42.137]  And that the people of California voted Proposition 187 to stop this nonsense, but that Gray Davis came in and killed the thing with the President of Mexico.
[01:50:42.137 --> 01:50:44.919]  Now Glenn, I remember 10 years ago you made films about this.
[01:50:44.919 --> 01:50:48.701]  You predicted first the collapse, then the racial rioting.
[01:50:48.701 --> 01:50:56.365]  When you come back, I was just reading a book about World War I the other day, or a section about World War I, about when Mexico attacked us.
[01:50:56.365 --> 01:50:58.427]  It's even in the mainline history books.
[01:50:58.427 --> 01:51:00.388]  Will Mexico try something?
[01:51:01.812 --> 01:51:03.793]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:51:03.793 --> 01:51:10.757]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:51:10.757 --> 01:51:19.162]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:51:19.162 --> 01:51:24.886]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:51:25.066 --> 01:51:26.908]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:51:26.908 --> 01:51:29.091]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:51:29.091 --> 01:51:33.617]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:51:33.617 --> 01:51:35.840]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:43.330]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:43.790]  I think so.
[01:52:01.384 --> 01:52:03.545]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:52:03.545 --> 01:52:05.946]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:52:05.946 --> 01:52:08.527]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:52:08.527 --> 01:52:09.787]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:09.787 --> 01:52:11.488]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:11.488 --> 01:52:14.369]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:14.369 --> 01:52:18.010]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:27.675 --> 01:52:32.503]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:33.803 --> 01:52:36.323]  An inside job?
[01:52:36.323 --> 01:52:38.764]  How dare you?
[01:52:38.764 --> 01:52:43.845]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:43.845 --> 01:52:46.305]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:46.305 --> 01:52:53.206]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:52:53.206 --> 01:52:56.027]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:52:56.027 --> 01:52:58.307]  Or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:58.307 --> 01:53:01.888]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:53:01.888 --> 01:53:02.988]  The headlines are clear.
[01:53:03.681 --> 01:53:06.605]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:53:06.605 --> 01:53:09.830]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:11.573]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:53:11.573 --> 01:53:14.898]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:53:14.898 --> 01:53:18.543]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.
[01:53:19.544 --> 01:53:23.206]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[01:53:23.206 --> 01:53:26.569]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[01:53:26.569 --> 01:53:29.430]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:34.073]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[01:53:34.073 --> 01:53:37.195]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[01:53:37.195 --> 01:53:46.401]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[01:53:46.401 --> 01:53:47.842]  Restaurants and small delis.
[01:53:48.482 --> 01:53:49.304]  We're good to go.
[01:54:25.482 --> 01:54:28.404]  All right, big government by design is bankrupt things.
[01:54:28.404 --> 01:54:32.508]  They want to bring in total federal control under international agreements.
[01:54:32.508 --> 01:54:33.829]  Our guest is Glenn Spencer.
[01:54:33.829 --> 01:54:40.734]  Glenn, you predicted all of this in articles and films you made with stunning accuracy.
[01:54:40.734 --> 01:54:46.879]  You also predicted that it's going to boil down into riots and open warfare.
[01:54:46.879 --> 01:54:48.340]  Are you still saying that?
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:51.223]  And when do you see that unfolding?
[01:54:51.223 --> 01:54:52.684]  This is what they're so frightened of.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:55.822]  Uh, in Los Angeles.
[01:54:55.822 --> 01:55:01.385]  This is why Obama-ish people are going to do everything they can to bail out the city and the state.
[01:55:01.385 --> 01:55:02.966]  Just imagine this!
[01:55:02.966 --> 01:55:05.848]  That this state, they cannot pay the tax refunds.
[01:55:05.848 --> 01:55:07.248]  The people had money coming back.
[01:55:07.248 --> 01:55:08.649]  They can't pay it.
[01:55:08.649 --> 01:55:09.910]  They were supposed to get it this week.
[01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:10.851]  They can't get it.
[01:55:10.851 --> 01:55:11.591]  They can't pay.
[01:55:11.591 --> 01:55:14.033]  They had to shut down all of their construction jobs.
[01:55:14.033 --> 01:55:15.213]  They can't do anything.
[01:55:15.213 --> 01:55:16.394]  The state is broke.
[01:55:16.394 --> 01:55:17.815]  It has no money.
[01:55:17.815 --> 01:55:18.615]  It has no money.
[01:55:18.615 --> 01:55:21.257]  They're cutting, what, 60,000 criminals out of the prisons.
[01:55:21.943 --> 01:55:25.005]  I mean, this is here today, right now in the United States.
[01:55:25.005 --> 01:55:26.326]  California is bankrupt.
[01:55:26.326 --> 01:55:27.907]  I predicted it.
[01:55:27.907 --> 01:55:29.908]  Now, I didn't predict a drug war in Mexico.
[01:55:29.908 --> 01:55:32.530]  Things turn out differently than you think.
[01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:34.331]  You never know what's going to happen.
[01:55:34.331 --> 01:55:49.160]  But that could be the premise upon which, yes, a flood of people, if the Mexican government falls, and there's a possibility of that, then you could have massive unrest and applications for asylum.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.520]  And guess who would let them in?
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:52.701]  Well, that's what Rick Perry's saying.
[01:55:52.701 --> 01:55:55.081]  They're going to let people in as asylum seekers.
[01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:57.502]  That's correct.
[01:55:57.502 --> 01:56:03.003]  This is the guys under which they're going to let in millions of Mexicans to take over the Southwest.
[01:56:03.003 --> 01:56:10.225]  Well, that's what the SPP, the North American Union Group, said they're going to use crises to create a continuous border.
[01:56:10.225 --> 01:56:12.785]  But we're right there.
[01:56:12.785 --> 01:56:15.046]  We're right there.
[01:56:15.046 --> 01:56:15.286]  Today.
[01:56:17.998 --> 01:56:22.741]  And they're just hoping to do all this by fiat and not make a political issue out of it.
[01:56:22.741 --> 01:56:27.183]  I didn't predict the Mexican drug wars, but I see how it happened.
[01:56:27.183 --> 01:56:29.024]  Well, it's more than drug war, Glenn.
[01:56:29.024 --> 01:56:32.666]  I mean, you've got just crime exploding.
[01:56:32.666 --> 01:56:41.171]  I talk to people now that go to Mexican resorts, and the federales come in at 10-01 after the pool closes and arrest them and steal everything from them.
[01:56:41.171 --> 01:56:43.472]  Yeah, this is more than that.
[01:56:43.472 --> 01:56:47.795]  This is a nation that was built, the whole culture.
[01:56:48.582 --> 01:56:55.006]  Uh, it's just, you know, they call it, uh, what is it, there's a term for it, okay?
[01:56:55.006 --> 01:56:56.047]  Mordito.
[01:56:56.047 --> 01:56:58.548]  Well, mordito is that everything is bribery.
[01:56:58.548 --> 01:56:59.769]  Little bite.
[01:56:59.769 --> 01:57:01.710]  That's correct.
[01:57:01.710 --> 01:57:05.052]  So, uh, but I could go on in depth on that.
[01:57:05.052 --> 01:57:06.393]  There's a whole cultural thing.
[01:57:06.393 --> 01:57:08.494]  This thing is coming apart.
[01:57:08.494 --> 01:57:09.915]  There is no foundation there.
[01:57:09.915 --> 01:57:12.637]  There is no cultural strength.
[01:57:12.637 --> 01:57:15.859]  Yes, in a sense there is, because once a Mexican, always a Mexican.
[01:57:16.647 --> 01:57:18.808]  The Mexicans are unified in that sense.
[01:57:18.808 --> 01:57:21.270]  They're very nationalistic.
[01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:28.134]  However, they will look for any reason and any excuse to move across that border.
[01:57:28.134 --> 01:57:33.438]  Because they want to take the Southwest back.
[01:57:33.438 --> 01:57:36.600]  Any way you slice it, we are headed into insane times.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:39.402]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:57:39.402 --> 01:57:45.045]  Because when California collapses, and you have unemployment there probably over 15% in reality.
[01:57:46.963 --> 01:57:48.184]  People are starving.
[01:57:48.184 --> 01:57:51.907]  They're starving and beginning to look, trying to find food out there.
[01:57:51.907 --> 01:57:59.714]  And especially when you have, let's say, 4 million illegal aliens who can't work, who have nothing.
[01:57:59.714 --> 01:58:01.476]  Things are going to get very ugly.
[01:58:01.476 --> 01:58:03.938]  And that's 4 million in California alone.
[01:58:03.938 --> 01:58:04.559]  That's correct.
[01:58:04.559 --> 01:58:11.225]  4 million people who technically have no rights to any welfare benefit.
[01:58:11.581 --> 01:58:18.647]  Well, I'm seeing reports in the mainstream news that Mexican-style kidnapping is beginning.
[01:58:18.647 --> 01:58:20.468]  Absolutely.
[01:58:20.468 --> 01:58:25.573]  That's going on in our... This was in the Associated Press yesterday.
[01:58:25.573 --> 01:58:34.860]  This was a major news yesterday that the drug war, okay, murder and mayhem, Mexican drug violence spills over into the U.S.
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:36.862]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:36.862 --> 01:58:40.325]  We've got Officer Sheriff Richard Mack coming on, but I want you to be able to finish up.
[01:58:42.188 --> 01:58:47.052]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:47.052 --> 01:58:51.196]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.196 --> 01:58:51.836]  Hello, friends.
[01:58:51.836 --> 01:58:52.897]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.897 --> 01:58:57.641]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.641 --> 01:59:00.603]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.603 --> 01:59:03.646]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.646 --> 01:59:08.370]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:09.710]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.710 --> 01:59:12.952]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.952 --> 01:59:19.934]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.934 --> 01:59:23.215]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.215 --> 01:59:23.475]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:25.896 --> 01:59:26.256]  Initiate!
[01:59:53.945 --> 01:59:56.346]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.346 --> 02:00:05.729]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.729 --> 02:00:07.030]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:08.810]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:10.571]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.571 --> 02:00:12.131]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.131 --> 02:00:13.092]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.092 --> 02:00:17.873]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.873 --> 02:00:21.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.601 --> 02:00:29.123]  We are live now into the third hour of the fourth hour coming up as well.
[02:00:29.123 --> 02:00:30.583]  We're not just doing the radio show right now.
[02:00:30.583 --> 02:00:42.687]  In the last two hours every day we simulcast live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the full studio with the documents, the video clips, putting the articles up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:00:42.687 --> 02:00:46.609]  Finishing up with Glenn Spencer of American Border Patrol.
[02:00:47.629 --> 02:01:05.054]  Uh, who is, uh, one of the most, uh, prominent and tireless, focused people exposing the crisis with our third world nation, uh, that is, uh, bordering our south that is now falling apart in on itself with just carnage and murder and mayhem and now mass kidnappings
[02:01:05.694 --> 02:01:11.539]  There have been a lot of cases where drug smugglers will take 40-plus people, kidnap them out of Arizona or Texas.
[02:01:11.539 --> 02:01:13.120]  The police have to raid it and get killed.
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.301]  I mean, it's getting bad.
[02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:18.144]  And now the State Department's admitting there's kidnappings all over the U.S.
[02:01:18.144 --> 02:01:19.445]  of Americans down to Mexico.
[02:01:19.445 --> 02:01:21.907]  They're not just kidnapping Americans when they go to Mexico.
[02:01:21.907 --> 02:01:24.309]  The police are sucking money out of the family.
[02:01:24.309 --> 02:01:27.391]  In a minute or two, we're going to go to Sheriff Richard Mack for the next 30 minutes.
[02:01:27.391 --> 02:01:30.033]  Then we have a state representative joining us with all these states.
[02:01:30.033 --> 02:01:30.293]  It's now 10.
[02:01:31.454 --> 02:01:39.059]  And as you heard Jack McClam earlier, 20 more moving to declare sovereignty against the Feds and all their globalist orders.
[02:01:39.059 --> 02:01:43.202]  But finishing up with that and your website, Glenn Spencer.
[02:01:43.202 --> 02:01:54.069]  Well yeah, we were talking about the fact that we have major crimes in our cities that are being committed by these drug kings.
[02:01:55.306 --> 02:01:57.207]  Here is the AP report.
[02:01:57.207 --> 02:01:57.467]  U.S.
[02:01:57.467 --> 02:02:06.910]  authorities are reporting a spike in killings, kidnappings, and home invasions connected to Mexico's murderous cartels right in our cities.
[02:02:06.910 --> 02:02:15.853]  Now, we've got 40% of the population of the prisons of California are in one way or another linked to illegal immigration.
[02:02:15.853 --> 02:02:20.834]  Now, they're going to let, I mean, now they're saying you've got to let go, 40% of the population.
[02:02:22.731 --> 02:02:33.314]  You have illegal aliens convicted of serious crimes during this unrest in California.
[02:02:33.314 --> 02:02:37.715]  They're going to release 60,000 of these people into the community?
[02:02:37.715 --> 02:02:45.957]  Which will then cause huge crime rates to even spike more, then the feds bring in more federalization of police and funding to control the general population.
[02:02:47.611 --> 02:02:49.332]  So they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:02:49.332 --> 02:02:52.775]  Lynn Spencer, I want to get you back on the next few weeks for part two of this interview.
[02:02:52.775 --> 02:02:54.356]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:02:54.356 --> 02:02:55.997]  Fire off the websites.
[02:02:55.997 --> 02:02:58.499]  AmericanPatrol.com.
[02:02:58.499 --> 02:02:59.059]  Alright.
[02:02:59.059 --> 02:03:00.720]  AmericanPatrol.com.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:04.203]  I got 151 people online right now.
[02:03:04.203 --> 02:03:04.563]  Alright.
[02:03:04.563 --> 02:03:05.844]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:03:05.844 --> 02:03:06.685]  Take care, my friend.
[02:03:06.685 --> 02:03:08.046]  Thanks a lot.
[02:03:08.046 --> 02:03:08.826]  Alright, folks.
[02:03:10.771 --> 02:03:15.736]  The next 30 minutes were joined by Sheriff Richard Mack.
[02:03:15.736 --> 02:03:21.342]  For those that don't know who he is, former sheriff in Graham County, Arizona, and longtime recidivist for freedom and individual rights.
[02:03:21.342 --> 02:03:24.986]  Right now, it is vital that they restore the Constitution and the Supreme Law of the land.
[02:03:24.986 --> 02:03:27.268]  The greatest threat we face today is not terrorists.
[02:03:27.268 --> 02:03:30.491]  It is our own federal government of America is conquered or ruined.
[02:03:30.491 --> 02:03:32.213]  It will be from within, not a foreign enemy.
[02:03:32.213 --> 02:03:33.634]  That's his quote.
[02:03:34.375 --> 02:03:35.796]  Well, Alex, it's so good to be back with you.
[02:03:35.796 --> 02:03:40.819]  It's been a while, and I've been following what you've been doing, and I really thank you for having me back on with you.
[02:03:40.819 --> 02:03:41.720]  It's a great pleasure.
[02:04:03.646 --> 02:04:06.488]  Well, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:04:06.488 --> 02:04:10.590]  Every major newspaper is announcing world government is the answer to the economic crisis.
[02:04:10.590 --> 02:04:15.233]  World government run by the very same central banks that are now engineering the crisis.
[02:04:15.233 --> 02:04:16.433]  Well, it is.
[02:04:16.433 --> 02:04:27.580]  And just like you're talking about the immigration problem, the global governance problem, where can we go?
[02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:29.081]  Where can we go for help?
[02:04:29.081 --> 02:04:30.201]  Washington D.C.?
[02:04:30.201 --> 02:04:30.842]  Your senator?
[02:04:30.842 --> 02:04:32.162]  Your congressman?
[02:04:32.162 --> 02:04:32.863]  All that's a joke.
[02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:54.925]  Richard Max, our guest, will be back after this short three-minute break and break down the state of the union according to this great patriot and his advice to police and military out there who are being asked more and more to violate real rights of the Constitution and aid the foreign banksters in their takeover of our once great republic.
[02:04:54.925 --> 02:04:55.326]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.348 --> 02:05:01.688]  I don't know.
[02:05:21.903 --> 02:05:23.923]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[02:05:23.923 --> 02:05:30.145]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:05:30.145 --> 02:05:33.926]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:38.767]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:05:38.767 --> 02:05:39.807]  Do your part.
[02:05:39.807 --> 02:05:42.408]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:09.411]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:06:09.411 --> 02:06:10.911]  The late great USA.
[02:06:10.911 --> 02:06:12.672]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:07:00.379 --> 02:07:04.082]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[02:07:04.082 --> 02:07:09.808]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[02:07:09.808 --> 02:07:14.151]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.

[02:07:16.614 --> 02:07:22.579]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.

[02:08:07.557 --> 02:08:09.319]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.319 --> 02:08:11.100]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:12.661]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.661 --> 02:08:14.222]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.222 --> 02:08:18.425]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.425 --> 02:08:20.747]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:08:21.656 --> 02:08:24.577]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.577 --> 02:08:28.238]  We are back live with Sheriff Richard Mack.
[02:08:28.238 --> 02:08:34.539]  We have more lawmen like him in this country, more defenders of liberty, more servants.
[02:08:34.539 --> 02:08:37.600]  Through servants is how great work is done.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:40.921]  True heroes that we wouldn't be in the situation we're in today.
[02:08:40.921 --> 02:08:44.162]  Sheriff Richard Mack, in the time we've got, I want to have you back up soon for a full hour.
[02:08:46.518 --> 02:08:49.139]  You know, going back to what I first said, I want you to speak to this.
[02:08:49.139 --> 02:08:52.700]  I mean, they're in the Time Magazine saying we're all socialists now.
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:54.080]  They're in Newsweek saying it.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:56.401]  Time Magazine has the headline, New World Order.
[02:08:56.401 --> 02:09:01.543]  They say a new global bank to run the United States, to control the entire world that we pay taxes to.
[02:09:01.543 --> 02:09:05.604]  This is what we always said the international bankers were planning because their own documents said it.
[02:09:05.604 --> 02:09:08.145]  Why are they now coming right out in the open with this?
[02:09:09.185 --> 02:09:14.887]  Why are they pushing this, and what does this mean to you that they're finally not lying about it anymore?
[02:09:14.887 --> 02:09:19.769]  You know, the FBI training manuals say you're a terrorist if you talk about a New World Order, and it doesn't exist.
[02:09:19.769 --> 02:09:23.070]  Now they're admitting it exists, but saying it's good.
[02:09:23.070 --> 02:09:29.772]  Well, I've written about... Time Magazine has talked about the New World Order quite a bit.
[02:09:29.772 --> 02:09:31.933]  I did an article about, I think,
[02:09:32.907 --> 02:09:40.012]  It was an issue of 1995 where Time Magazine said, had an article, Who Should Keep the Keys?
[02:09:40.012 --> 02:09:47.878]  And it talked about Henry Kissinger saying that we need to compromise American idealism in order to fit into today's global society.
[02:09:47.878 --> 02:09:51.200]  This isn't that new, and you and I both know that.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:55.963]  But I think now is the time for them to make their play.
[02:09:55.963 --> 02:09:59.005]  They're obviously not hiding it anymore.
[02:09:59.005 --> 02:09:59.486]  They've got
[02:10:00.566 --> 02:10:10.975]  New World Order boys in there that have been pushing this, you know, ever since, well, the first George Bush, obviously, was pushing for this.
[02:10:10.975 --> 02:10:13.497]  He talked about the New World Order all the time.
[02:10:13.497 --> 02:10:17.681]  Bill Clinton talked about the New World Order all the time.
[02:10:17.681 --> 02:10:19.202]  George Jr.
[02:10:19.202 --> 02:10:22.525]  didn't say the words nearly as much as his dad did.
[02:10:23.228 --> 02:10:26.889]  But he was certainly pushing for this.
[02:10:26.889 --> 02:10:29.469]  They're giving all our money to the to the banksters.
[02:10:29.469 --> 02:10:30.970]  The banksters own America.
[02:10:30.970 --> 02:10:34.270]  The banks own our currency.
[02:10:34.270 --> 02:10:43.012]  And that's why people like you and I have said all along that you better have gold and silver and food storage and you better be able to protect yourselves and your family.
[02:10:43.012 --> 02:10:46.953]  And so along with your food storage, you need guns and ammo.
[02:10:47.928 --> 02:11:00.040]  These things, we've been preaching since we've been on the air and since we've been involved in the Freedom Movement, myself, for the last 15 years, maybe a little bit longer.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:08.628]  Why there's being so blatant about it right now, I don't know, but the monster is knocking on the door and we better be ready for it.
[02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:12.622]  There's nobody protecting us in Washington, D.C.
[02:11:12.622 --> 02:11:19.288]  Ron Paul would probably be the only one, but he's basically ineffective because he's all by himself.
[02:11:19.288 --> 02:11:31.417]  You know, just like I said before the break, if you think you're going to call your congressman, I get all these emails all the time, call your congressman, call your senator, and ask him not to do this bill or whatever.
[02:11:31.417 --> 02:11:32.918]  Those are all jokes, Alex.
[02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:37.422]  I do not waste my time trying to call my congressman or senator anymore.
[02:11:38.081 --> 02:11:39.621]  Those guys are bought and paid for.
[02:11:39.621 --> 02:11:40.962]  They're going to do what they're going to do.
[02:11:40.962 --> 02:11:42.342]  They do not care about you.
[02:11:42.342 --> 02:11:44.822]  They do not care about their constituents.
[02:11:44.822 --> 02:11:48.823]  And there is one person who I believe can stop this new world order.
[02:11:48.823 --> 02:11:53.244]  His name is your county sheriff.
[02:11:53.244 --> 02:11:58.885]  And that's why I've written a new book, The County Sheriff America's Last Hope.
[02:11:58.885 --> 02:12:02.226]  It details the documentation.
[02:12:02.226 --> 02:12:04.726]  There is no question that your sheriff
[02:12:05.242 --> 02:12:08.164]  Has the responsibility to protect you from tyranny.
[02:12:23.352 --> 02:12:28.515]  Literally, he can, you know, call up a posse, the local draft, it's totally constitutional.
[02:12:28.515 --> 02:12:37.020]  Instead, they've tried to shut down the sheriff, demonize it, or run feds and New World Order people for the position, so they've been attacking it from every angle.
[02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:40.042]  Weakening it, getting rid of it, making it appointed, not elected.
[02:12:40.042 --> 02:12:43.944]  I think the best way to start here is... You're right.
[02:12:43.944 --> 02:12:44.845]  They've already stopped.
[02:12:44.845 --> 02:12:46.786]  They've already done away with the sheriff in Connecticut.
[02:12:47.751 --> 02:12:54.013]  And you were talking about the immigration problem, not the immigration problem, but the illegal immigration problem.
[02:12:54.013 --> 02:13:04.295]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has endorsed my book, by the way, he's on the back of the book, he believes in all of this about the autonomy of the sheriff.
[02:13:04.295 --> 02:13:05.696]  Look what he has done.
[02:13:05.696 --> 02:13:14.598]  He has been, I guess, the only sheriff in this country to round up illegals and arrest them and take them and put them in jail.
[02:13:15.584 --> 02:13:23.827]  And he's having the feds come and get him as soon as they can and say, look, I'm doing your job here, come and get them and send them back.
[02:13:23.827 --> 02:13:27.249]  This is an amazing example of your sheriff.
[02:13:27.249 --> 02:13:31.671]  Have you noticed that nobody can get in his way?
[02:13:31.671 --> 02:13:42.635]  He even had the city of Mesa, where he was doing some raids there, and he actually went into the city of Mesa building and arrested some illegal aliens in the city complex.
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:53.244]  And the chief of police got real mad and was spouting off on the news about Sheriff Arpaio should be coordinating such an effort with him.
[02:13:53.244 --> 02:13:57.545]  And then they interview Arpaio, of course, and you know what he said.
[02:13:57.545 --> 02:14:02.207]  The last time I looked, Mesa is within the jurisdiction of Maricopa County.
[02:14:02.207 --> 02:14:04.788]  He says, I don't have to ask anybody's permission.
[02:14:04.788 --> 02:14:07.069]  And that's the point I make in the book.
[02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:09.170]  Your sheriff is not a bureaucrat.
[02:14:09.170 --> 02:14:11.811]  He does not answer to anyone except the people.
[02:14:12.623 --> 02:14:19.248]  And he's bound by oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, and therefore he can protect you from the IRS.
[02:14:19.248 --> 02:14:25.633]  He can protect you and your money, your property, your welfare, your children.
[02:14:25.633 --> 02:14:28.696]  He is the only answer left.
[02:14:29.622 --> 02:14:33.765]  The county sheriff, America's last hope.
[02:14:33.765 --> 02:14:39.549]  I think at the county level, but there's also juries, grand juries, that form of voting for the people is another hope.
[02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:46.013]  And we now have ten states and twenty others now saying they may sign on to declare sovereignty and end the bills.
[02:14:46.013 --> 02:14:55.579]  I've been reading the last few days on air, we've had some state reps on, it states we will not have martial law, we will not have gun confiscation, we will not have forced compulsory service.
[02:14:55.579 --> 02:14:57.501]  And they list what the feds are doing and so
[02:14:58.081 --> 02:15:04.907]  The state is the answer, and enshrined in that, the smallest unit of that, is the sheriff.
[02:15:04.907 --> 02:15:12.193]  And you're right, I've seen cases all over the country where they're trying to come repossess people's homes, and the sheriff's saying no.
[02:15:12.193 --> 02:15:21.961]  That's why they tried to move to block the sheriff, and basically federalize the states, because originally, and how our country's set up, it is the state that is the true unit of power.
[02:15:21.961 --> 02:15:25.945]  It is, and the county even more powerful than that, I do believe.
[02:15:27.339 --> 02:15:32.463]  In the book, you'll see the documentation from my lawsuit that you mentioned when you introduced me.
[02:15:32.463 --> 02:15:48.434]  The lawsuit is key to all of this because it establishes the constitutional premise for the sheriff to have this power, and it's backed up by a recent Supreme Court ruling which came out in June of 1997.
[02:15:48.434 --> 02:15:50.936]  This has not been rescinded.
[02:15:50.936 --> 02:15:56.140]  It's law, and Justice Scalia details quite clearly
[02:15:56.829 --> 02:16:04.513]  That the federal government has no power over the county, or the county sheriff, or the state employees.
[02:16:04.513 --> 02:16:08.254]  Instead, though, under Obama, they're trying to federalize everything.
[02:16:08.254 --> 02:16:15.978]  They're building FEMA camps, with the local sheriff's offices out of it, with the military, with the police, and with clergy response teams.
[02:16:15.978 --> 02:16:17.879]  Can you speak to that?
[02:16:17.879 --> 02:16:19.599]  Well, yes.
[02:16:19.599 --> 02:16:22.801]  You know, those are happening, or it appears.
[02:16:22.801 --> 02:16:24.562]  I haven't seen any here in Arizona yet.
[02:16:25.566 --> 02:16:27.227]  It doesn't matter where they're going up.
[02:16:27.227 --> 02:16:31.609]  If they're going up one place, they're going to be going up in others.
[02:16:31.609 --> 02:16:40.333]  I've maintained, even when I was sheriff, and I maintain even now, that the sheriff can tell FEMA to stay out of his county.
[02:16:40.333 --> 02:16:42.334]  We can make our own preparations.
[02:16:42.334 --> 02:16:50.578]  And the typical example of this is the failure of the federal government, especially during Hurricane Katrina, to really help people.
[02:16:50.578 --> 02:16:54.960]  And people have their hands out and expect the federal government to come take care of you.
[02:16:55.563 --> 02:16:59.185]  Don't expect it, don't count on it, and don't even want it.
[02:16:59.185 --> 02:17:03.947]  You need to make your own preparations at the county level.
[02:17:03.947 --> 02:17:05.308]  Look what they did also at Katrina.
[02:17:05.308 --> 02:17:07.949]  They started taking everybody's guns away from them.
[02:17:07.949 --> 02:17:18.795]  That's what I was going to say is, finally the parish sheriff, not a county, a parish there, had to go stop FEMA from cutting the police communication lines because they wanted total federal control.
[02:17:19.716 --> 02:17:29.658]  Of course, and they're going to, and if we continue to allow it, if we have sheriffs who aren't aware of their duty, then this is going to continue to happen.
[02:17:29.658 --> 02:17:42.361]  I mean, you can look at the problems that happened when sheriffs relinquished at Ruby Ridge, at Waco, at New Hampshire with the Elaine, what was her last name?
[02:17:42.361 --> 02:17:43.462]  Edna Lane Brown.
[02:17:43.462 --> 02:17:45.142]  Yeah, exactly, the Brown family.
[02:17:45.808 --> 02:17:55.111]  I mean, every place where the sheriff, and I think these were good sheriffs and good people there, they just are ignorant of the power and authority they have.
[02:17:55.111 --> 02:18:03.274]  The federal government has no jurisdiction in your county to be doing these things unless you, as the sheriff, allow it.
[02:18:03.274 --> 02:18:11.377]  And yes, you can go along, but to do so means you're throwing your constituents to the dogs.
[02:18:11.377 --> 02:18:14.598]  And this needs to be turned around, and I do believe that this book
[02:18:15.307 --> 02:18:16.108]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:18:42.635 --> 02:18:52.894]  And if we could get three or four hundred of them on board, just get ten percent on board, the rest of it will snowball, or you could move to where one of them who actually is a constitutional sheriff.
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:58.564]  And this idea is spreading, thanks to you and others, of rediscovering liberty in our true system of government.
[02:18:58.564 --> 02:19:04.449]  A microcosm is studying the Western expansion, the robber barons, the oil companies, the coal companies, the railroads.
[02:19:04.449 --> 02:19:12.796]  They would come in and buy off a sheriff and use him to let the Pinkerton and others go in and slaughter people and kick them off their land.
[02:19:12.796 --> 02:19:17.580]  But in more cases than not, it was the people's sheriff that would fight off the bankers.
[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:19.662]  So we've gone through this before.
[02:19:19.662 --> 02:19:20.222]  Yes, we have.
[02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:33.574]  I really feel that the time is ripe because of the hopelessness that people felt during especially this last campaign.
[02:19:33.574 --> 02:19:42.598]  The presidential election I think left so many people with a bad taste in their mouth of hopelessness and right now I'm giving a message that there is hope and it is your county sheriff.
[02:19:44.415 --> 02:19:46.296]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:46.296 --> 02:19:52.299]  Final segment with Sheriff Richard Mack, straight ahead after this quick break.
[02:19:52.299 --> 02:19:55.041]  And his new book, we'll talk about that as well.
[02:20:01.522 --> 02:20:09.771]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[02:20:09.771 --> 02:20:14.336]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[02:20:14.336 --> 02:20:19.001]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[02:20:19.001 --> 02:20:20.423]  It's a documented fact.
[02:20:20.503 --> 02:20:20.843]  We're good to go!
[02:20:39.358 --> 02:20:44.419]  Once a day, FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.

[02:20:54.581 --> 02:20:54.821]  That's 888-949-3570.
[02:20:54.821 --> 02:21:00.062]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:16.290]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:16.290 --> 02:21:21.877]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:21:22.208 --> 02:21:24.450]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[02:21:24.450 --> 02:21:29.554]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:29.554 --> 02:21:34.758]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:34.758 --> 02:21:39.121]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:39.121 --> 02:21:40.202]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:40.202 --> 02:21:44.705]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:21:44.705 --> 02:21:46.087]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:21:49.589 --> 02:21:52.591]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:21:52.591 --> 02:21:56.493]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:56.493 --> 02:21:59.395]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:59.395 --> 02:22:07.640]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:09.301]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:22:10.276 --> 02:22:11.818]  But who is the enemy?
[02:22:11.818 --> 02:22:12.639]  Bin Laden.
[02:22:12.639 --> 02:22:13.640]  This is his ammo.
[02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:14.982]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:22:14.982 --> 02:22:16.984]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:22:16.984 --> 02:22:24.132]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:22:24.132 --> 02:22:24.633]  Some U.S.
[02:22:24.633 --> 02:22:30.260]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:34.843]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:34.843 --> 02:22:44.929]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:22:44.929 --> 02:22:46.170]  Fabled Enemies.

[02:22:53.935 --> 02:22:57.278]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:23:00.751 --> 02:23:09.457]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:23:09.457 --> 02:23:14.580]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:15.461]  and Canada.
[02:23:15.461 --> 02:23:21.985]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:23:22.549 --> 02:23:25.954]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:23:25.954 --> 02:23:28.397]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[02:23:28.397 --> 02:23:35.005]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[02:23:35.005 --> 02:23:38.530]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[02:23:38.530 --> 02:23:40.332]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-
[02:23:41.133 --> 02:23:43.134]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[02:24:08.311 --> 02:24:12.593]  Said the Joker to the thief, there's too much confusion.
[02:24:12.593 --> 02:24:15.955]  I can't get no relief.
[02:24:15.955 --> 02:24:20.218]  Outside in the cold distance, a wildcat did growl.
[02:24:20.218 --> 02:24:24.240]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:30.303]  Said the Joker to the thief, there's too much confusion.
[02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.371]  I can't
[02:24:54.036 --> 02:24:58.258]  Sheriff Richard Mack is our guest with us till 40 after them getting into financial news.
[02:24:58.258 --> 02:25:03.960]  We have a state rep coming on, this time from Missouri, fighting the New World Order.
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:10.743]  Look, anytime good people disengage from government, tyranny comes in and fills the vacuum.
[02:25:12.885 --> 02:25:16.807]  99% of countries and nations have been tyrannical.
[02:25:16.807 --> 02:25:18.688]  And that's really the bottom line.
[02:25:18.688 --> 02:25:20.348]  You will have everything you've got stolen.
[02:25:20.348 --> 02:25:25.891]  You really think you could just give the bankers your pension funds and your 401Ks and they wouldn't run a scam to steal it?
[02:25:25.891 --> 02:25:28.352]  That's what this police state's about, is total control.
[02:25:28.352 --> 02:25:39.096]  Sheriff Richard Mack, I think it's important in the time we have left with you, for you to reach out to the police, not just the sheriff's departments, and explain to them how they've been manipulated, how they're being turned to the dark side.
[02:25:39.096 --> 02:25:41.157]  Perhaps you should briefly talk about your awakening.
[02:25:42.216 --> 02:25:43.496]  Well, it is.
[02:25:43.496 --> 02:25:46.017]  And this book is directed towards everyone.
[02:25:46.017 --> 02:25:50.458]  And my first book, the prequel to this one, is The Proper Role of Law Enforcement.
[02:25:50.458 --> 02:25:57.160]  And it is intended for all police officers, so they will become peace officers in this country.
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:11.464]  And yes, quite frankly, the police departments across this country, whether it's sheriff's offices or police departments, have been brought into this mode of and been inculcated, if not brainwashed, into believing that all laws must be enforced.
[02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:17.353]  And that no matter what, it comes down from the pike from Washington, D.C.
[02:26:17.353 --> 02:26:19.294]  or from the state capitol must be enforced.
[02:26:19.294 --> 02:26:33.783]  But that really, and the book talks about that very issue, that lack of principle behind that, because that's actually, as Thomas Jefferson called it, laws were nothing more but tools of the tyrant.
[02:26:33.783 --> 02:26:35.544]  And that's what laws have become today.
[02:26:35.544 --> 02:26:38.026]  And so all this photo radar crap
[02:26:38.852 --> 02:26:47.656]  And the multi-billion dollar industry of wholesale distribution of traffic tickets, especially radar tickets.
[02:26:47.656 --> 02:26:48.577]  You can go on and on.
[02:26:48.577 --> 02:26:56.140]  The drug war, the drug war is something else I have preached against for the last 10 years.
[02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:59.182]  I'm one of the speakers for law enforcement against prohibition.
[02:26:59.182 --> 02:27:01.583]  Prohibition does not work unless you're
[02:27:02.325 --> 02:27:05.848]  Promoting a police state and Big Brother government.
[02:27:05.848 --> 02:27:10.432]  And more drugs because then there's so much profit and in every case of prohibition it increases.
[02:27:10.432 --> 02:27:11.773]  Of course.
[02:27:11.773 --> 02:27:12.334]  Of course.
[02:27:12.334 --> 02:27:13.615]  I mean, let's be real.
[02:27:13.615 --> 02:27:15.196]  Prohibition doesn't work.
[02:27:15.196 --> 02:27:25.985]  Abraham Lincoln said prohibition is an insane law and an insane practice and makes crimes out of things that were never crimes at all.
[02:27:25.985 --> 02:27:27.366]  Prohibition isn't anything new.
[02:27:29.146 --> 02:27:30.487]  It goes way, way back.
[02:27:30.487 --> 02:27:36.129]  In fact, back during the Scottish Rebellion against the King of England during Braveheart.
[02:27:36.129 --> 02:27:49.634]  You can even see in that movie of Braveheart where the King of England outlawed bagpipe music because it promoted patriotism and feelings of wanting to be free.
[02:27:49.634 --> 02:27:51.975]  And so, you know, Prohibition is nothing new.
[02:27:51.975 --> 02:27:56.117]  And now, isn't it insane that we have hemp
[02:27:57.272 --> 02:28:06.675]  Illegal when we could use hemp to restore the economy of this country and make oil and fuel and all sorts of things that we could get from this hemp plant.
[02:28:06.675 --> 02:28:10.697]  And let's be clear, almost all the hemp varieties don't have THC.
[02:28:10.697 --> 02:28:12.257]  No, they don't.
[02:28:12.257 --> 02:28:15.699]  It's better than cotton, better for rope, but it's banned.
[02:28:15.699 --> 02:28:16.879]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:28:16.879 --> 02:28:19.420]  And I don't even care if they have THC in it.
[02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:19.960]  Who cares?
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:21.440]  But it doesn't.
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:24.081]  And hemp has been used in our country way back.
[02:28:24.081 --> 02:28:25.782]  The Declaration of Independence was written on it.
[02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:28.581]  So is the Constitution.
[02:28:28.581 --> 02:28:37.527]  But it's absurd what our government does and then turns right around and lies to us and says stuff like, but there's no earmarks in this bill.
[02:28:37.527 --> 02:28:50.115]  You know, it's amazing that people, we have so many Kool-Aid drinkers in this country and I'm afraid that the police have been part of the Kool-Aid drinkers and we've got to stand up and recognize our oath of office.
[02:28:50.115 --> 02:28:54.758]  The book points out and starts with this principle that James Madison said that
[02:28:56.613 --> 02:29:04.635]  States, as you and I were talking earlier, states and counties are supposed to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority.
[02:29:04.635 --> 02:29:06.115]  Well, that's what this is about.
[02:29:06.115 --> 02:29:22.639]  And if we could depend on the 600-some-odd-thousand peace officers in this country to keep their oath of office, to uphold and defend the Constitution, instead of being redcoats for the central government, and sometimes for the states.
[02:29:23.494 --> 02:29:25.635]  We could get our country back.
[02:29:25.635 --> 02:29:29.215]  The people of this country could have their freedom back tomorrow.
[02:29:29.215 --> 02:29:30.536]  Sheriff Richard Mack, stay there.
[02:29:30.536 --> 02:29:32.796]  Final segment with you coming up.
[02:29:32.796 --> 02:29:38.057]  And if police and military people don't like hearing this from Sheriff Richard Mack, you don't like the United States.
[02:29:38.057 --> 02:29:40.138]  Because this is what this country was founded on.
[02:29:40.138 --> 02:29:48.240]  It was set up to stop a powerful central government because they always are bad, they always go bad, and they always hurt the people big time.
[02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:49.700]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:29:51.877 --> 02:29:55.805]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.805 --> 02:29:58.510]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.841 --> 02:30:05.384]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[02:30:05.384 --> 02:30:07.866]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?
[02:30:07.866 --> 02:30:08.927]  Guaranteed!
[02:30:08.927 --> 02:30:15.853]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com has helped tens of thousands out of debt since 1993 and will free you from the debt trap.
[02:30:15.853 --> 02:30:23.560]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com legally guarantees to put an end to wage garnishment, bank levies and liens and you won't pay one dime to creditors.
[02:30:23.860 --> 02:30:24.260]  I think so.
[02:30:39.569 --> 02:30:43.370]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[02:31:09.701 --> 02:31:10.962]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:31:10.962 --> 02:31:18.011]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:31:18.011 --> 02:31:26.521]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:31:26.909 --> 02:31:33.993]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:31:33.993 --> 02:31:37.175]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:31:37.175 --> 02:31:42.939]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:31:42.939 --> 02:31:46.021]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[02:32:03.058 --> 02:32:04.799]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:32:04.799 --> 02:32:07.481]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:32:07.481 --> 02:32:12.626]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[02:33:20.946 --> 02:33:25.372]  I'll be done with the film in a few weeks and it'll be mass-produced and ship out on...
[02:33:26.934 --> 02:33:30.575]  March 15th, and we'll also be at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[02:33:30.575 --> 02:33:32.815]  We're getting an amazing response.
[02:33:32.815 --> 02:33:34.635]  People are freaking out, wanting it.
[02:33:34.635 --> 02:33:37.936]  This doesn't attack him for the Kenya stuff, or is he really a proper U.S.
[02:33:37.936 --> 02:33:39.156]  citizen and all that.
[02:33:39.156 --> 02:33:41.697]  We're not saying that that's not an issue, just we're not getting into that.
[02:33:41.697 --> 02:33:52.359]  We're getting into who he's appointing, what he's doing, his history, the gun control, the open borders, the FEMA camps, and how he's controlled by the very Wall Street group that engineered the implosion by design.
[02:33:52.359 --> 02:33:54.059]  This film is dynamic.
[02:33:54.659 --> 02:33:55.860]  This film is dynamic.
[02:33:55.860 --> 02:33:58.062]  I was up here again until midnight last night.
[02:33:58.062 --> 02:34:00.784]  I'm working on this tirelessly with my team.
[02:34:00.784 --> 02:34:05.527]  TheObamaDeception.net is the website.
[02:34:05.527 --> 02:34:06.989]  And it's now up on the shopping cart.
[02:34:06.989 --> 02:34:08.930]  We have a link to it on the main page of InfoWars.com.
[02:34:10.191 --> 02:34:15.474]  PrisonPlanet.com yet, but why should you pre-order?
[02:34:15.474 --> 02:34:22.619]  Well, when you pre-order, the orders come in in a stack, and the first person to order is the first person to have it shipped to them by UPS.
[02:34:22.619 --> 02:34:23.459]  And it's vital.
[02:34:23.459 --> 02:34:25.300]  That's why I usually make a film in six months.
[02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:33.665]  I make this one in like three, because I have been racing and racing and racing, but it's just as much quality or more than other films.
[02:34:33.665 --> 02:34:34.806]  We're getting better and better at this.
[02:34:37.295 --> 02:34:38.536]  And it's just an unbelievable film.
[02:34:38.536 --> 02:34:39.997]  It's obviously dangerous for us to do this.
[02:34:39.997 --> 02:34:42.698]  They come after everybody that fights them, but we're telling it like it is.
[02:34:42.698 --> 02:34:43.959]  He's a front man for the New World Order.
[02:34:43.959 --> 02:34:48.102]  So, the Obama Deception is on sale right now at Infowars.com.
[02:34:48.102 --> 02:34:50.963]  We've got to get the toll-free line ready to take orders.
[02:34:50.963 --> 02:34:52.944]  In fact, let's call them and get that set up.
[02:34:52.944 --> 02:34:54.746]  The Obama Deception, $19.95.
[02:34:54.746 --> 02:34:58.988]  I want you to make unlimited copies of this and give it out to everybody you know.
[02:34:58.988 --> 02:35:00.909]  Going back to Sheriff Richard Mack.
[02:35:04.984 --> 02:35:10.110]  There was a story in the San Antonio Express News two days ago and I see these every couple days and don't even cover them.
[02:35:10.110 --> 02:35:11.512]  I don't like bashing police.
[02:35:11.512 --> 02:35:17.438]  I know in psychology it actually makes them get more into a gang mentality group.
[02:35:17.438 --> 02:35:24.286]  I know that most beat cops are good people, good men and women, but I know that these boss hog towns and a lot of these big cities are criminal.
[02:35:24.286 --> 02:35:24.867]  I've seen it.
[02:35:26.201 --> 02:35:35.129]  And they just talk about all over Texas, I mean, just county after county, they just pull you over and take your watch, take your wallet, under acid forfeiture, no drugs, no nothing found illegal.
[02:35:35.129 --> 02:35:36.550]  They rob old ladies.
[02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:38.032]  It's all in the news.
[02:35:38.032 --> 02:35:43.476]  I mean, it's not just bad cops or bad corrupt systems or violating the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[02:35:43.476 --> 02:35:46.279]  We're seeing what happens in Mexico and most other nations.
[02:35:46.279 --> 02:35:48.941]  They are just going completely criminal.
[02:35:48.941 --> 02:35:52.584]  And they're now recruiting more and more criminals into the police force, the military.
[02:35:53.465 --> 02:35:57.467]  We've got to turn this around now, or the whole society will collapse like Mexico.
[02:35:57.467 --> 02:36:01.789]  Well, we do, and we all have a responsibility with this.
[02:36:01.789 --> 02:36:03.230]  We're off track in our country.
[02:36:03.230 --> 02:36:05.651]  We've forgotten our roots.
[02:36:05.651 --> 02:36:08.673]  We have gotten off our constitutional basics.
[02:36:08.673 --> 02:36:13.435]  We don't teach fundamentals in the police academies.
[02:36:13.435 --> 02:36:16.116]  They do hire people that should not be in there.
[02:36:16.116 --> 02:36:18.477]  And I'm grateful, too, just as you said, that these are
[02:36:20.205 --> 02:36:23.527]  The exceptions and not the norm, but it's happening too much.
[02:36:23.527 --> 02:36:27.169]  And we need people to be vigilant.
[02:36:27.169 --> 02:36:30.270]  And, you know, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
[02:36:30.270 --> 02:36:34.553]  And we've got to get a handle on all of this.
[02:36:34.553 --> 02:36:41.737]  You know, in my first book, The Proper Role of Law Enforcement, it addresses that issue and it addresses how I was converted to the Constitution.
[02:36:41.737 --> 02:36:43.998]  And I wasn't born a constitutional cop.
[02:36:45.145 --> 02:36:53.507]  You know, it came from looking at my oath of office one day that I swore to uphold independent constitution, but I had never read it, so I started reading it.
[02:36:53.507 --> 02:37:04.410]  And I believe that when these fundamental documents come to life for police officers and peace officers and sheriffs in this country, that they will have the same conversion.
[02:37:04.410 --> 02:37:14.072]  I believe, just as you said, that most of these men and women are good people, but they have to be given proper and good information or they're never going to change.
[02:37:14.875 --> 02:37:19.577]  I believe this change is possible, and in my book it addresses that.
[02:37:19.577 --> 02:37:30.260]  Like I told you, it documents a large portion of my case that was endorsed by the Supreme Court, and it's a landmark decision, and it needs to be used.
[02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:39.884]  And Madison, James Madison is quoted against, again talking about states standing up, and counties standing up against the federal government.
[02:37:39.884 --> 02:37:43.725]  And it says, hence, a double security arises to the rights of the people.
[02:37:44.505 --> 02:37:49.847]  The different governments will control each other at the same time that each will be controlled by itself.
[02:37:49.847 --> 02:37:52.168]  That's a quote from Madison, which is in the decision.
[02:37:52.168 --> 02:37:52.608]  Yeah.
[02:37:52.608 --> 02:37:55.570]  Each, each, each binding down the others to the Constitution.
[02:37:55.570 --> 02:37:56.270]  Correct.
[02:37:56.270 --> 02:37:57.070]  Correct.
[02:37:57.070 --> 02:38:00.171]  And so now, this is the only place in the book that it does this.
[02:38:00.171 --> 02:38:09.815]  So it says, to the reader, so who is charged with safeguarding the people from the federal government when it refuses to control itself?
[02:38:09.815 --> 02:38:11.456]  And then in parentheses it says,
[02:38:12.119 --> 02:38:24.695]  Please write the answer in the space provided and there's an empty slide right there for the reader to put that in there and you want your sheriff to realize the answer and there could be several answers.
[02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:26.197]  It could be the sheriff, it could be
[02:38:27.015 --> 02:38:31.179]  The answer is, we are, or the Sheriff, or I am.
[02:38:31.179 --> 02:38:44.792]  And that goes into the grand juries, the juries, how they've been made these kept, enslaved, in the dark creatures, who were told how to rule and told what to do, when the founders in history in the Magna Carta states, even before that, 1215 in England,
[02:38:46.053 --> 02:39:09.087]  That it is the jury that judges the law and the case, and if they think a law is unconstitutional, or it's tyranny, or they don't respect it, and they knew not to trust the police and the government, that they were even above the king, and our ancestors fought incredible wars to get this basic right, and that's what everything is based on, and now they're abolishing the Magna Carta in England, and crowing and trumpeting they've done this.
[02:39:09.087 --> 02:39:13.090]  So, bottom line, if you don't stand up, you will be run over.
[02:39:13.851 --> 02:39:14.531]  Correct.
[02:39:14.531 --> 02:39:27.119]  And the overall question, and it asks the question specifically, to your sheriff, to your favorite peace officer, will you stand against tyranny?
[02:39:27.119 --> 02:39:29.201]  Well, there's only two answers.
[02:39:29.201 --> 02:39:29.921]  Yes, I will.
[02:39:29.921 --> 02:39:30.682]  Or no, I won't.
[02:39:30.682 --> 02:39:38.146]  If he won't, especially after you've given this information, then you've got to get rid of him or you've got to move somewhere else.
[02:39:38.146 --> 02:39:40.168]  The second one is, yes, I will.
[02:39:40.168 --> 02:39:42.189]  Then you convince him and show him
[02:39:43.115 --> 02:39:45.917]  When and where he should do that.
[02:39:45.917 --> 02:39:48.259]  We have got to stand behind the sheriff on this.
[02:39:52.742 --> 02:39:57.085]  You know, my life, I was a happy person, but I, you know, there was this emptiness.
[02:39:57.085 --> 02:40:01.968]  And when I studied history and studied what was happening, my life is so fulfilled, so dynamic.
[02:40:01.968 --> 02:40:03.429]  It is what you're meant to do.
[02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:07.352]  Men are meant to guard their hut, guard their village, guard their county.
[02:40:07.352 --> 02:40:08.412]  This is what humans do.
[02:40:08.412 --> 02:40:20.861]  I mean, it's the natural law that you become usurped or killed or enslaved if you don't stand up and aren't strong, and if you don't have justice, and that justice is what creates milk and honey and wonderful societies.
[02:40:20.861 --> 02:40:22.322]  How has your life changed
[02:40:23.102 --> 02:40:29.350]  Since you were a constitutional police officer and a constitutional sheriff and the fights you've led and the victories you've had.
[02:40:29.350 --> 02:40:31.012]  Most of the time we fight back, we have victories.
[02:40:31.012 --> 02:40:33.195]  That's the big secret.
[02:40:33.195 --> 02:40:40.543]  And I just feel sorry for those that are involved in tyranny and rationalize it because they don't know that it isn't money or treasure or anything that life is about.
[02:40:41.164 --> 02:41:00.779]  It is literally about being a servant, and being a protector, and being a guardian, and that all of us, whether we're a police officer, or a sheriff's deputy, or a firefighter, or a military person, or a shopkeeper, we are all guardians, and that we have a job in life to be involved to fight evil, because evil is always in our society.
[02:41:00.779 --> 02:41:03.741]  So, what has that journey been like for you?
[02:41:03.741 --> 02:41:10.306]  Well, the first thing that I thought of when you said that, and I've even asked that question before, it's been a real roller coaster ride.
[02:41:10.837 --> 02:41:16.060]  It has been lots of ups, lots of downs, very exciting, thrills.
[02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:24.604]  I thought I was going to die a few times, but my wife is hung with me and my kids have also, and I've got a good family.
[02:41:24.604 --> 02:41:26.725]  And it's brought us all fulfillment.
[02:41:26.725 --> 02:41:31.948]  And I've got the respect of my kids because they know that I stood for what I believed in.
[02:41:33.170 --> 02:41:38.655]  Even though it didn't bring us any money, in fact it did quite the opposite of that, but this has never been about money.
[02:41:38.655 --> 02:41:47.543]  It's been about one thing, and one thing only, and that is standing and fighting for what I truly believe in, and this is what it has accomplished.
[02:41:47.543 --> 02:41:55.770]  Personally, I really feel that I've been able to make a little difference, and the good Lord put me on earth to make a difference.
[02:41:55.770 --> 02:41:57.812]  I believe that he's called me to this work
[02:41:58.852 --> 02:42:00.694]  And I'm not going to turn my back on it.
[02:42:00.694 --> 02:42:02.115]  I'm not going to stop.
[02:42:02.115 --> 02:42:04.116]  I'm only 56 years old.
[02:42:04.116 --> 02:42:12.482]  I've got plenty of time left to stand and fight for this holy cause, just as Patrick Henry called it, the holy cause of liberty.
[02:42:12.482 --> 02:42:14.024]  We cannot give up.
[02:42:14.024 --> 02:42:18.367]  Friends and neighbors and everybody listening to this, do not give up.
[02:42:18.367 --> 02:42:26.373]  I've got speaking engagements about this very thing in Texas where people are inviting their sheriffs and favorite cops and deputies.
[02:42:26.877 --> 02:42:29.318]  I've got another one lined up in Ohio.
[02:42:29.318 --> 02:42:35.300]  I want to be doing this every weekend, so get on the website, sheriffmack.com.
[02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:41.303]  I'm going to try to put my schedule on there so you know, but anyway, give me an email, sheriffmack.hotmail.com.
[02:42:41.303 --> 02:42:42.783]  It's on my website.
[02:42:42.783 --> 02:42:43.524]  Give me a call.
[02:42:43.524 --> 02:42:47.385]  Drop me a line, and let's make this movement.
[02:42:47.385 --> 02:42:53.768]  This movement can stop the New World Order, but we've got to get this information out.
[02:42:54.472 --> 02:42:59.798]  Get the book for yourself, get one for your favorite cop, and definitely get one for your sheriff.
[02:42:59.798 --> 02:43:02.001]  And let's get this thing rolling.
[02:43:02.001 --> 02:43:04.283]  Alright, Sheriff Mack, I would just say this.
[02:43:05.768 --> 02:43:07.148]  It isn't just physical courage.
[02:43:07.148 --> 02:43:14.771]  All the psychological studies show it's moral courage to admit you've been manipulated, to admit you've been indoctrinated and inculcated.
[02:43:14.771 --> 02:43:16.491]  We don't even ask people to think the way we do.
[02:43:16.491 --> 02:43:26.895]  Just look at history, look at what you're doing, look at what you're involved in, whether you're a business person or a police officer, whatever it is, and ask if this country's going in the right direction, and ask what you're doing.
[02:43:26.895 --> 02:43:34.557]  And all you silly yuppies that giggle and smirk and laugh about all this stuff, I told you the bankers were going to take everything you had because we had their own IMF World Bank documents.
[02:43:35.057 --> 02:43:36.237]  You know, this isn't a game.
[02:43:36.237 --> 02:43:38.618]  These guys aren't playing patty cake.
[02:43:38.618 --> 02:43:42.399]  The people running this new world order killed 200 plus million people last century, okay?
[02:43:42.399 --> 02:43:46.381]  So we don't stand up and fight these creatures, you know, just for fun.
[02:43:46.381 --> 02:43:53.283]  We do this because we know that there's no other choice and it is the best feeling and the most fulfilling thing in the world
[02:43:53.863 --> 02:43:57.467]  To just gut up, get past the fear, then you won't have it anymore.
[02:43:57.467 --> 02:43:59.890]  Once you go through fear, it's gone.
[02:43:59.890 --> 02:44:01.191]  And it is animating.
[02:44:01.191 --> 02:44:02.913]  The animating contest of liberty.
[02:44:02.913 --> 02:44:04.615]  You aren't living.
[02:44:04.615 --> 02:44:07.238]  Bungee jumping, you're not going to find this exhilaration.
[02:44:07.238 --> 02:44:08.520]  Partying, having sex.
[02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:13.602]  Doing drugs, getting drunk, none of that is going to fulfill you.
[02:44:13.602 --> 02:44:22.805]  Being rich, being powerful, nothing is going to fulfill you like helping others and knowing what's going on in the world and not being a sucker and a chump.
[02:44:22.805 --> 02:44:27.786]  And we just really want to salute you, Sheriff Richard Mack, and we'll talk to you in the near future.
[02:44:27.786 --> 02:44:31.348]  Thanks a lot, Alex, and God bless you, and thanks again for having me on.
[02:44:31.348 --> 02:44:32.328]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:44:34.292 --> 02:44:34.812]  Absolutely.
[02:44:34.812 --> 02:44:42.756]  You know, I think about how they could set me up, imprison me, how evil the feds are, how evil most of the states are now, and I'm not even worried about it.
[02:44:42.756 --> 02:44:49.658]  I worry about my little sweet, dear, darling, angelic children, but, you know, if something bad happens to them, that's the new world order, that's not me.
[02:44:49.658 --> 02:44:55.861]  I put it in God's hands, because they have no future, and other children have no future, if we don't stand up.
[02:44:55.861 --> 02:44:58.062]  If we give in to the fear, they win.
[02:44:58.062 --> 02:45:00.243]  If we fight, they lose.
[02:45:01.890 --> 02:45:05.454]  All you have to do is put yourself in motion.
[02:45:05.454 --> 02:45:10.158]  All you have to do is make the commitment to fight tyranny.
[02:45:10.158 --> 02:45:13.221]  In small ways, it will grow into great things.
[02:45:13.221 --> 02:45:14.863]  Victory is ours.
[02:45:14.863 --> 02:45:16.705]  Resistance is victory.
[02:45:17.796 --> 02:45:22.319]  Now, that said, we need your financial support here.
[02:45:22.319 --> 02:45:27.983]  And the ways we ask for financial support are buying the books and videos, making all the copies you want, getting PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, all of that.
[02:45:27.983 --> 02:45:34.368]  Because people say, Alex, you need to do this, you need to do that, you need to expand, you need to take action in all these ways.
[02:45:34.368 --> 02:45:36.850]  And a lot of times I'd say, you know, what are you telling me to do more?
[02:45:37.912 --> 02:45:38.392]  But you know what?
[02:45:38.392 --> 02:45:39.313]  I'm taking the challenge.
[02:45:39.313 --> 02:45:40.013]  I am doing more.
[02:45:40.013 --> 02:45:43.074]  But if you ask me to do more, you have to support more.
[02:45:43.074 --> 02:45:52.299]  And the number one thing is telling your email list, your friends, your family, your neighbors, your community, about AM and FM stations we're on in your area, shortwave, internet, satellite, the free podcast.
[02:45:52.299 --> 02:45:54.260]  That's how this show grows!
[02:45:54.260 --> 02:45:55.180]  Are you doing that?
[02:45:55.180 --> 02:45:57.781]  I mean, it's one thing to almost take action.
[02:45:57.781 --> 02:45:59.382]  It's another thing to take action.
[02:45:59.382 --> 02:46:00.023]  That's the biggest thing.
[02:46:00.023 --> 02:46:02.444]  I think the show's the most effective, the best guest, the best info.
[02:46:02.444 --> 02:46:04.565]  We bring all these great activists that have had success.
[02:46:05.385 --> 02:46:10.307]  At the state level, federal level, he's won at the Supreme Court, held back a lot of gun grabbing.
[02:46:10.307 --> 02:46:13.288]  And it's all because you, the Cordlisters, have supported these other people.
[02:46:13.288 --> 02:46:21.651]  We bring on here as a larger platform, but we need the platform itself to grow so that we can launch others.
[02:46:21.651 --> 02:46:28.373]  This, literally, we're like a Cape Canaveral rocket base, and we are launching, you know, ICBMs at the enemy.
[02:46:28.373 --> 02:46:33.335]  And we're trying to produce more info weapons and more powerful weapons to blow holes in the enemy.
[02:46:35.660 --> 02:46:37.441]  And we are going straight into the enemy.
[02:46:37.441 --> 02:46:38.881]  We are committed.
[02:46:38.881 --> 02:46:39.761]  We are focused.
[02:46:39.761 --> 02:46:49.885]  Now, I bring Ted Anderson up here a couple times a week now because gold was $280 an ounce when I first started plugging it.
[02:46:49.885 --> 02:46:53.406]  Now it's gone up into $930, $940, $950 today.
[02:46:53.406 --> 02:46:54.787]  I haven't looked in the last few minutes.
[02:46:54.787 --> 02:46:57.308]  It's up at $940 something, $930 something and rising.
[02:46:57.308 --> 02:46:57.568]  And Ted,
[02:47:01.403 --> 02:47:03.546]  Doesn't really even make money doing this.
[02:47:03.546 --> 02:47:09.112]  He buys the gold and silver when it's low, and he sells it when it's low, and he sells it when it's high.
[02:47:09.112 --> 02:47:12.276]  And he is at the very tail end of a purchase he made three weeks ago when gold was at $830.
[02:47:14.472 --> 02:47:17.735]  And Ted is the owner of this Genesis Network.
[02:47:17.735 --> 02:47:20.337]  By the way, Ted, I've been so busy I keep forgetting.
[02:47:20.337 --> 02:47:23.159]  Have you gotten my new Star Guide feed yet?
[02:47:23.159 --> 02:47:24.660]  I'm working on that right now.
[02:47:24.660 --> 02:47:28.363]  We just sent the equipment up to ABC so we can get that going.
[02:47:28.363 --> 02:47:29.644]  Leasing that feed?
[02:47:29.644 --> 02:47:31.366]  Yeah.
[02:47:31.366 --> 02:47:39.292]  We've got a T1 connection there, but we have to break it up with an AdTran modem type unit that can do that.
[02:47:39.292 --> 02:47:41.234]  And then we put the codex up there.
[02:47:41.707 --> 02:47:44.368]  In order to transcode and get your voice back on.
[02:47:44.368 --> 02:47:46.389]  I mean, that's an example of what I'm saying.
[02:47:46.389 --> 02:48:08.559]  I'm on one ABC feed, but we're going to go, this radio show, 24 hours a day, except for Jason Bermas, on our own system with Ted, and it's Ted stepping up to pay the $5,000 a month, and the feds, side issue, I'm going to bring this up now, Ted, and we'll hold you over the next segment, the feds put out this line, we know they're feds, that we're owned by ABC, and owned by the Saudi Arabians, and that
[02:48:10.250 --> 02:48:12.912]  And this is the kind of lies they do, and that we're on ABC.
[02:48:12.912 --> 02:48:22.537]  Yes, you go out and you lease a Clear Channel, an ABC receiver, or a Jones receiver, those are the three, and radio station owners are laughing, and so are managers, they know.
[02:48:22.537 --> 02:48:28.981]  That's the piece of equipment, like you, you know, you contract for an ISDN line, you get it from AT&T, we're not owned by AT&T.
[02:48:28.981 --> 02:48:31.522]  But that shows how the feds operate, right?
[02:48:31.522 --> 02:48:33.543]  They're going, oh look, they're owned by ABC.
[02:48:33.543 --> 02:48:37.606]  No, this, any of you can call ABC and lease your own feed.
[02:48:38.366 --> 02:48:41.888]  And the reason we go with ABC is they don't restrict the feed.
[02:48:41.888 --> 02:48:47.390]  You can lease one from Clear Channel, but they won't let the stations have the encoders to get you off unless you're a Clear Channel show.
[02:48:47.390 --> 02:49:01.015]  And it's just so sick how I think of the fact that we're trying to get another satellite for the stations out there to deliver my show 24 hours a day so they can air it more, and then the enemy gets upset by that and lies to people and says that we're ABC.
[02:49:01.015 --> 02:49:02.496]  Can you explain that to folks, Ted?
[02:49:02.856 --> 02:49:03.296]  Well, yeah.
[02:49:03.296 --> 02:49:04.497]  I mean, it's simple as this.
[02:49:04.497 --> 02:49:10.102]  I mean, it's the delivery mechanism that's used by all the radio shows out there in the marketplace.
[02:49:10.102 --> 02:49:10.903]  You're right about that.
[02:49:10.903 --> 02:49:23.013]  I did lease from Clear Channel for a little while, and unless if you're a premier group radio show like Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or some of these others that they produce, they won't open up their receivership.
[02:49:23.013 --> 02:49:25.034]  And they didn't tell you that when they leased it to you?
[02:49:25.034 --> 02:49:25.515]  Oh, no.
[02:49:25.515 --> 02:49:30.099]  I mean, I had to get out of a five-year contract, and I had to buy my way out of it.
[02:49:30.099 --> 02:49:30.739]  It was crazy.
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:33.982]  It just happens to open it up.
[02:49:33.982 --> 02:49:41.428]  Anybody that's picking up Paul Harvey or ABC News has a receiver that can pick up the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:41.428 --> 02:49:50.136]  And if you want to syndicate in the marketplace, if you want to make any kind of a dent in the terrestrial market, meaning licensed AM and FM stations out there,
[02:49:50.492 --> 02:49:56.955]  You have to have an ABC Star Guide 3 feed, which is now developing into this new XDS receiver.
[02:49:56.955 --> 02:50:03.598]  My whole point is, we're doing a talk radio show, and I have a Neumann mic, German.
[02:50:03.598 --> 02:50:05.479]  I'm not owned by the Neumann Corporation.
[02:50:05.919 --> 02:50:08.560]  I have a Toshiba TV in front of me as a monitor.
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:09.941]  I'm not owned by Toshiba.
[02:50:09.941 --> 02:50:12.702]  I'm just saying, listeners, this is what the Feds do.
[02:50:12.702 --> 02:50:17.365]  It makes me angry, not that they're putting the lies out, but that people are so gullible.
[02:50:17.365 --> 02:50:19.706]  Like there's a porno magazine called Genesis.
[02:50:19.706 --> 02:50:24.308]  They claim we're owned by the porno magazine, when there's hundreds of companies called Genesis.
[02:50:24.308 --> 02:50:28.830]  Another writer put out a lie, because there was some Genesis thing with some Saudi Arabian.
[02:50:30.291 --> 02:50:36.314]  I think you ought to post on the site your charter, your corporate charter, that it's a Ted Anderson company.
[02:50:36.314 --> 02:50:40.276]  I'm tired of the feds running black ops and people believing it, Ted.
[02:50:40.276 --> 02:50:41.316]  Yeah, and there's a lot of...
[02:50:43.069 --> 02:50:44.190]  Funny information.
[02:50:44.190 --> 02:50:48.552]  I think, you know, I think you ought to just sue one of those people just to teach people a lesson.
[02:50:48.552 --> 02:50:49.473]  That's a good idea.
[02:50:49.473 --> 02:50:50.994]  I mean, I know you sue people.
[02:50:50.994 --> 02:50:52.615]  You need to go ahead and just sue them.
[02:50:52.615 --> 02:50:52.735]  Why?
[02:50:52.735 --> 02:50:58.879]  Because I'm tired of them getting, you know, we need to get aggressive and start hammering people and call them in court and go, now listen, you bastard liar!
[02:50:58.879 --> 02:51:00.820]  You talk, you tell the judge what's going on!

[02:51:54.255 --> 02:51:58.756]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:58.756 --> 02:52:00.696]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:11.292 --> 02:52:12.653]  Who is the enemy?
[02:52:12.653 --> 02:52:13.453]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:13.453 --> 02:52:14.453]  This is his M.O.
[02:52:14.453 --> 02:52:15.814]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:15.814 --> 02:52:17.814]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:17.814 --> 02:52:24.957]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:52:24.957 --> 02:52:25.437]  Some U.S.
[02:52:25.437 --> 02:52:31.079]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:31.799 --> 02:52:35.302]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:35.302 --> 02:52:38.105]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:53:03.416 --> 02:53:06.001]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[02:53:06.001 --> 02:53:09.066]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[02:53:09.066 --> 02:53:13.253]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[02:53:14.013 --> 02:53:16.115]  You know that you need to prepare.
[02:53:16.115 --> 02:53:19.517]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.

[02:53:59.173 --> 02:54:00.854]  OrganicaSeed.com today!
[02:54:04.758 --> 02:54:07.640]  They came and took it all away, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:10.943]  You know, Ted, I didn't mean to get sidetracked.
[02:54:10.943 --> 02:54:13.885]  I just got into radio stuff with you here on air.
[02:54:13.885 --> 02:54:15.626]  We've been so busy, I hadn't talked to you about that.
[02:54:15.626 --> 02:54:20.510]  Jason Vermas' show starts 9 to midnight, Central, March 1st.
[02:54:20.510 --> 02:54:21.931]  A couple Thursdays from now.
[02:54:21.931 --> 02:54:25.514]  And I just know what a good guy you are and how hard you work.
[02:54:25.514 --> 02:54:29.196]  Everything you've done and the Fed's little lies about you really make me mad.
[02:54:30.077 --> 02:54:37.247]  I think I'll look at suing one or two of these people just to, you know, it'll be a court record of their lives and get a judgment against them, but that's a side issue.
[02:54:37.247 --> 02:54:38.849]  I'm glad you're gonna get us another satellite feed.
[02:54:38.849 --> 02:54:40.852]  Good job, Ted.
[02:54:40.852 --> 02:54:46.419]  Let's get into the gold here in the four minutes that we have got left here today.
[02:54:47.040 --> 02:54:48.501]  You are at the very tail end.
[02:54:48.501 --> 02:54:51.243]  And folks, he told you this one was at $700 and that ran out.
[02:54:51.243 --> 02:54:52.384]  And then it was $800 and then $830.
[02:54:52.384 --> 02:54:54.526]  It's about to run out.
[02:54:54.526 --> 02:54:58.709]  He was able, at that original price, to get some more Sovereigns, British Sovereigns and Franks.
[02:54:58.709 --> 02:55:01.290]  Where is gold right now, Ted?
[02:55:01.290 --> 02:55:03.172]  Gold today has seen $948.80.
[02:55:03.172 --> 02:55:04.533]  It's down by just about $2.
[02:55:04.533 --> 02:55:04.773]  It's up $27.
[02:55:04.773 --> 02:55:05.073]  It's at $944.10.
[02:55:05.073 --> 02:55:07.395]  I did some math on the British Sovereigns.
[02:55:14.892 --> 02:55:18.394]  Currently, right now, they're at $288 when I buy them.
[02:55:18.394 --> 02:55:22.076]  Right now, I'm carrying them for $265.
[02:55:22.076 --> 02:55:32.702]  Four of them put together make an ounce, so I took the difference of $23 from where they would be today to what I'm offering them for, and it comes out to be $92 per ounce.
[02:55:32.702 --> 02:55:34.323]  I also have the French Frank.
[02:55:34.323 --> 02:55:36.924]  I did the math on that one as well.
[02:55:36.924 --> 02:55:40.906]  They are up $19 from where I'm carrying them right now.
[02:55:40.906 --> 02:55:41.187]  They're at $235.
[02:55:41.187 --> 02:55:41.807]  I've got them at $217.
[02:55:44.246 --> 02:55:53.211]  You multiply that by five because it's a fifth of an ounce, $95 above and beyond where they're trading at right now per ounce.
[02:55:53.211 --> 02:55:54.291]  That's the difference.
[02:55:54.291 --> 02:55:57.313]  I mean the silver market right now is even higher.
[02:55:57.313 --> 02:56:01.355]  Silver currently right now today is at $13.72.
[02:56:01.355 --> 02:56:12.261]  I have the silver dollars, not the silver dollars, wish I had them, I have the walking liberty halves and the dimes from back when it was down at $9 an ounce when silver was down there.
[02:56:12.639 --> 02:56:19.905]  The same price as the dimes currently right now are at $1,590 per $100 face value.
[02:56:19.905 --> 02:56:25.249]  Chad, is it safe to say this is the best deal you've ever offered?
[02:56:25.249 --> 02:56:27.671]  Well Alex, I haven't ever offered it for this year.
[02:56:27.891 --> 02:56:34.174]  Not like this before, and you know, again, I mean, I talked to Motormyte about it.
[02:56:34.174 --> 02:56:41.157]  This is priced at $114 less than the market is right now, and most places don't even have gold or silver, and when they do, they put huge premiums over it.
[02:56:41.157 --> 02:56:43.818]  This is an insane deal.
[02:56:43.818 --> 02:56:45.199]  How long are you offering it?
[02:56:45.199 --> 02:56:48.460]  Well, Alex, I can't offer this past midnight tonight.
[02:56:48.460 --> 02:56:49.640]  There's no way.
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:52.962]  Unless if I can have a huge drop in gold, it ain't gonna happen.
[02:56:53.422 --> 02:56:58.143]  I mean, I'm watching the argument that's going on in Washington, D.C.
[02:56:58.143 --> 02:57:06.826]  about this stimulus package, and then right behind that, the Secretary of Treasury asking for like $3 trillion to bail out the banks again.
[02:57:06.826 --> 02:57:10.307]  And last time, $700 billion turned into $8.5 trillion.
[02:57:10.307 --> 02:57:18.349]  Bloomberg reports the bailout's now at $9.7 trillion, that's the newest number, so $3 trillion would be three times that of what they always left, which we're talking about $30 trillion.
[02:57:18.989 --> 02:57:21.510]  I mean, these numbers, it's insane.
[02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:22.790]  Protect yourselves now.
[02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:24.230]  They're hyper-inflating the currency.
[02:57:24.230 --> 02:57:25.531]  There's no doubt of that.
[02:57:25.531 --> 02:57:31.452]  Give the brokers a call on the francs, on the sovereigns, and on the half dollars and the dimes in silver.
[02:57:31.452 --> 02:57:31.552]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:57:31.552 --> 02:57:32.032]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:57:32.032 --> 02:57:33.613]  And that's good through midnight, February 11th.
[02:57:33.613 --> 02:57:35.673]  That's a nice birthday present from me to everybody.
[02:57:35.673 --> 02:57:37.013]  Today's my birthday, Ted.
[02:57:43.975 --> 02:57:45.917]  Oh, wow, happy birthday, I forgot about that.
[02:57:45.917 --> 02:57:48.359]  I'm getting to be an old man now, I'm 35.
[02:57:48.359 --> 02:57:52.043]  Well, you're getting to be an old man, all right.
[02:57:52.043 --> 02:57:53.685]  I'm a lot of miles on there.
[02:57:53.685 --> 02:58:04.154]  Oh, well, I tell you what, every year goes by and the amount of people that are listening to this show and how it grows, I can't tell you, Alex, I am so appreciative of what you've done.
[02:58:04.154 --> 02:58:07.518]  No, I'm appreciative of the listeners spreading the word.
[02:58:07.518 --> 02:58:08.559]  So where is Silver right now?
[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:10.461]  Silver currently right now $13.
[02:58:10.461 --> 02:58:12.024]  And you're selling it at the $9 level.
[02:58:12.024 --> 02:58:12.545]  What's it priced in at $9?
[02:58:12.545 --> 02:58:12.605]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:12.605 --> 02:58:15.049]  And you're pricing gold at $114 less than the market is.
[02:58:23.703 --> 02:58:25.665]  Yeah, right now at this time, you can't beat that.
[02:58:25.665 --> 02:58:28.367]  I know that my competition is shuddering.
[02:58:28.367 --> 02:58:33.612]  The other thing, too, is I have a lot of other coins that are due for a price increase starting tonight, too.
[02:58:33.612 --> 02:58:38.916]  So, if you're interested in something else... This is Ed, 800-686-2237.
[02:58:38.916 --> 02:58:39.697]  Stay with us.
[02:58:39.697 --> 02:58:40.678]  Thanks, Ted.
[02:58:40.678 --> 02:58:43.080]  Thanks.
[02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:46.343]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.564 --> 02:58:53.245]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.245 --> 02:58:57.987]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.987 --> 02:59:00.948]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.948 --> 02:59:03.989]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.989 --> 02:59:08.711]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.931 --> 02:59:10.073]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:10.073 --> 02:59:13.317]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.317 --> 02:59:20.307]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[02:59:40.159 --> 02:59:41.380]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.324 --> 02:59:56.707]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:59:56.707 --> 03:00:06.056]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:06.056 --> 03:00:09.940]  We are back live, now already into the final hour.
[03:00:09.940 --> 03:00:12.043]  State Representative Jim Gast will be joining us.
[03:00:12.043 --> 03:00:13.364]  They're getting him off the floor right now.
[03:00:13.364 --> 03:00:14.105]  He's in Missouri.
[03:00:16.041 --> 03:00:19.683]  Ten states and another 20, according to Jack McClain, are moving to declare sovereignty.
[03:00:19.683 --> 03:00:22.165]  They're talking about martial law, gun confiscations.
[03:00:22.165 --> 03:00:26.028]  Now they're not going along with compulsory slavery, a new domestic draft.
[03:00:26.028 --> 03:00:26.908]  Obama's pushing.
[03:00:26.908 --> 03:00:28.509]  This is exciting.
[03:00:28.509 --> 03:00:29.350]  We're on the march.
[03:00:29.350 --> 03:00:30.931]  The empire is on the run.
[03:00:30.931 --> 03:00:36.655]  Ted Anderson's gone now, but you just heard him do that gold pitch from gold he bought when it was at $830 level.
[03:00:39.813 --> 03:00:43.415]  Just amazing deal on precious metals in stock.
[03:00:43.415 --> 03:00:45.917]  800-686-2237.
[03:00:45.917 --> 03:00:48.199]  800-686-2237.
[03:00:48.199 --> 03:00:49.820]  Take advantage of this or you're crazy.
[03:00:49.820 --> 03:00:52.842]  In fact, I'm going to take advantage of it every six months or so.
[03:00:52.842 --> 03:00:54.283]  I'll buy a little bit of silver and gold.
[03:00:54.283 --> 03:00:55.264]  This deal is just too good.
[03:00:55.264 --> 03:00:56.484]  800-686-2237.
[03:00:56.484 --> 03:01:01.888]  Okay, we are back live now into the fourth hour.
[03:01:01.888 --> 03:01:03.669]  Coming up, I'm going to get into Madoff's wife.
[03:01:03.669 --> 03:01:05.811]  Pulled $15 million before his arrest out of Reuters.
[03:01:06.331 --> 03:01:07.392]  They've got a new drug czar.
[03:01:07.392 --> 03:01:08.273]  We're going over all that.
[03:01:08.273 --> 03:01:10.736]  Time Magazine calls for a world government.
[03:01:10.736 --> 03:01:15.462]  And this issue, titled the New World Order, saying a foreign bank will control the United States.
[03:01:15.462 --> 03:01:17.484]  See, this has been the plan.
[03:01:17.484 --> 03:01:20.067]  The good news is ten states now have legislation introduced.
[03:01:20.067 --> 03:01:21.408]  It was eight last Friday.
[03:01:21.408 --> 03:01:22.370]  Now it's ten.
[03:01:22.370 --> 03:01:24.472]  Twenty more looking at it.
[03:01:24.472 --> 03:01:25.854]  And we've been having people on from
[03:01:27.597 --> 03:01:31.601]  Oklahoma and from Washington and from New Hampshire, more from New Hampshire.
[03:01:31.601 --> 03:01:35.544]  Throughout this week and next week we're having these great patriots, these great men and women on.
[03:01:35.544 --> 03:01:48.016]  Representative Jim Guest has introduced HCR 13, claims sovereignty of the United States under the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution for all powers, not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government under the Constitution.
[03:01:48.016 --> 03:01:49.878]  Now that's already enshrined
[03:01:52.039 --> 03:01:59.825]  Well, it's an honor for me to be on and visit with the people of this great country and help them join our forces here to... It's sad that we have to have a wake-up call to take back the powers that supposedly are ours.
[03:02:16.630 --> 03:02:17.051]  Absolutely.
[03:02:17.051 --> 03:02:23.539]  We're going to break in a moment and come back and talk more about it, but what spurred you to introduce this and how is it going and what does it cover?
[03:02:25.104 --> 03:02:28.687]  I guess this probably started a couple years ago when this REAL ID Act came out.
[03:02:28.687 --> 03:02:31.509]  That was also a direct violation of the 10th Amendment.
[03:02:31.509 --> 03:02:35.492]  And we started down the road to get states to enact legislation to oppose that.
[03:02:35.492 --> 03:02:42.217]  And we kept citing it was a direct violation of about three or four amendments in the Bill of Rights, and obviously the 10th.
[03:02:42.217 --> 03:02:51.264]  And as we got on down there in a bit with other legislators around the country, I thought, you know, we need to make a concerted and united effort here to file some legislation to
[03:02:51.986 --> 03:02:56.507]  Notify our federal government that we're going to take back those rights delineated in the 10th Amendment.
[03:02:56.507 --> 03:02:58.768]  So that's kind of what was behind it there.
[03:02:58.768 --> 03:03:02.389]  Have you seen the New Hampshire one that says, we're saying no to martial law?
[03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:04.069]  Yeah, absolutely!
[03:03:04.069 --> 03:03:05.869]  What do you think of that?
[03:03:05.869 --> 03:03:07.630]  That was a very bold step.
[03:03:07.630 --> 03:03:16.512]  I presented my HCR 13, the 10th Amendment, right here in my committee yesterday morning, and I briefly noted it.
[03:03:16.512 --> 03:03:20.093]  I said, if you think this language is a little bit strong, you need to read the New Hampshire where it says,
[03:03:20.871 --> 03:03:24.872]  If they violate any of these, we're going to nullify the Constitution and start all over again.
[03:03:24.872 --> 03:03:29.054]  So yes, I commend them for that very brave and bold step they're taking.
[03:03:29.054 --> 03:03:32.135]  And New Hampshire has the strongest state constitution.
[03:03:32.135 --> 03:03:38.377]  It's even better in powers delegated to the state and the people than even the federal, the only one that I know of that's even stronger.
[03:03:38.377 --> 03:03:43.099]  And it states, right to revolt, and they're basically preparing for right to revolt clause.
[03:03:44.147 --> 03:03:44.747]  That's right.
[03:03:44.747 --> 03:03:48.290]  I just reiterated that in a committee meeting.
[03:03:48.290 --> 03:03:50.652]  I kind of went over the high point of it.
[03:03:50.652 --> 03:03:55.555]  I said, you know, this is no wonder they call it the live free or die state up there.
[03:03:55.555 --> 03:04:01.560]  We need more patriots and more people around the country to stand up with what they're starting there.
[03:04:02.526 --> 03:04:08.732]  I want to go over your concerns about federal control because it's not even federal, it's international.
[03:04:08.732 --> 03:04:15.219]  Time Magazine says it is a world government run by private banks, so they can't call us kooks.
[03:04:15.219 --> 03:04:22.607]  Wall Street Journal is calling for North American Union and getting rid of the dollar and letting a foreign bank, and we're being taken over like a third world country by foreign banks.
[03:04:23.067 --> 03:04:33.892]  We are, and that's one of the efforts we've been working on here is a resolution with other states to make people aware of this North American Union and the One World Government that's coming on.
[03:04:33.892 --> 03:04:47.038]  People kind of made light of it for several years when all of a sudden the lights started to come on and they realized what's taking place, but it's difficult when some of these powers get that far down the road before you can get people to take action on it.
[03:04:48.493 --> 03:04:51.279]  It's never too late until the doors close, so we need to work on it.
[03:05:02.429 --> 03:05:06.251]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[03:05:06.251 --> 03:05:13.336]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:05:13.336 --> 03:05:14.817]  Here is why.

[03:05:25.263 --> 03:05:27.984]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[03:05:27.984 --> 03:05:30.105]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[03:05:30.105 --> 03:05:31.086]  this fall?
[03:05:31.086 --> 03:05:32.006]  Don't wait.

[03:06:00.895 --> 03:06:05.096]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[03:06:05.096 --> 03:06:08.576]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:08.576 --> 03:06:10.257]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:11.395 --> 03:06:12.756]  Who is the enemy?
[03:06:12.756 --> 03:06:13.556]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:13.556 --> 03:06:14.537]  This is his M.O.
[03:06:14.537 --> 03:06:15.917]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:15.917 --> 03:06:17.918]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:17.918 --> 03:06:25.061]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:25.061 --> 03:06:25.541]  Some U.S.
[03:06:25.541 --> 03:06:31.184]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:31.884 --> 03:06:35.786]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:35.786 --> 03:06:45.872]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:06:45.872 --> 03:06:47.093]  Fabled enemies.

[03:07:05.468 --> 03:07:06.331]  You feel tired.

[03:08:03.220 --> 03:08:09.847]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.847 --> 03:08:14.171]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.171 --> 03:08:20.218]  The United States, the jewel and the crown of this world, has been seized by offshore banks publicly.
[03:08:21.946 --> 03:08:32.795]  And if we don't address just how dire things are, just how out of control things are, with Newsweek saying we're now a socialist nation, we're all socialists now, we're not going to be able to turn this around.
[03:08:32.795 --> 03:08:35.198]  No more time to play patty cake or mince words.
[03:08:35.198 --> 03:08:39.762]  This is tyrannical world government at point blank range attacking our country and looting it.
[03:08:40.649 --> 03:08:47.618]  They got all these scared people saying, we'll do whatever you say, take our rights away, just give us, you know, money, give us jobs.
[03:08:47.618 --> 03:08:55.929]  When the very same crew filling Obama's administration, if you thought Bush was bad, are the very people in the Clinton administration who changed the banking rules to engage in this criminal looting.
[03:08:55.929 --> 03:08:57.411]  A bunch of made-offs, basically.
[03:08:58.183 --> 03:09:12.032]  We've got a representative guest on with us, and I appreciate Jim Guest joining us from Missouri, District 5, Republican, and I told you it was 8 states, I guess he's the 9th because he introduced it yesterday.
[03:09:12.032 --> 03:09:14.574]  It's up to 10 now, and 20 more looking at it.
[03:09:16.355 --> 03:09:24.540]  Why did you, I mean looking at things happening, run over the thought process of introducing this, where it's going, how we help you get this passed.
[03:09:24.540 --> 03:09:29.363]  I know I'm on a couple stations, like the fine station KCXL out of Kansas City.
[03:09:29.363 --> 03:09:36.268]  How do folks put pressure, as you know the foreign bankers are lobbying, putting pressure against you guys to not save the republic.
[03:09:36.268 --> 03:09:37.869]  How do we help you?
[03:09:37.869 --> 03:09:39.010]  A. Why'd you do this?
[03:09:39.010 --> 03:09:40.210]  What's the main threats?
[03:09:40.210 --> 03:09:41.011]  B. How do we help you?
[03:09:42.615 --> 03:09:53.200]  The main reason is I've got two grandchildren and I keep telling people I want them to grow up in the world I have.
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:10:00.403]  The last thing I want to do is sit on the front step of my house and tell my two granddaughters I can remember back when America used to be free.
[03:10:00.403 --> 03:10:04.025]  I don't want them to ask me what it was like, Grandpa, when America was free.
[03:10:04.025 --> 03:10:05.866]  That's one of the main reasons I'm working this far.
[03:10:06.565 --> 03:10:13.051]  The children are future, so they've got a free country to live in, so they don't have to live under this tyrannical power that's coming down at us here, so...
[03:10:13.550 --> 03:10:17.631]  In addition to that, you know, it's an obligation to the people of my constituents.
[03:10:17.631 --> 03:10:22.193]  They elected me to look out for them, to protect their rights and their freedoms, and that's what I was doing.
[03:10:22.193 --> 03:10:32.176]  That's what we've got a number of legislators around the country doing, so it's a concern today, but it's more of a concern of what's going to happen tomorrow if we don't take action today.
[03:10:32.176 --> 03:10:36.337]  And like you said, you know, it's not tomorrow we need to take action, it's today, because
[03:10:37.357 --> 03:10:43.180]  I keep saying we're at the crossroads, and whatever freedoms and rights we lose, we're never going to get them back.
[03:10:43.180 --> 03:10:48.863]  On the campaign trail, you know, a typical response was, they always say, you know, are you better off today than you were four years ago?
[03:10:48.863 --> 03:10:52.865]  I always ask the question, do you have more or less rights today than you had four years ago?
[03:10:52.865 --> 03:11:02.090]  And people realize, kind of a wake-up call, that slowly their rights are being taken away, and they can see the federal government's power grab taking over that.
[03:11:02.090 --> 03:11:05.272]  You know, right now, the federal government's trying to
[03:11:05.959 --> 03:11:10.242]  Make people happy by putting a few dollars in their pocket and take more control of their lives.
[03:11:10.242 --> 03:11:14.265]  So, that's why it's so important that we join here.
[03:11:14.265 --> 03:11:16.487]  And, you know, how can people in Missouri help?
[03:11:16.487 --> 03:11:16.987]  Pretty easy.
[03:11:16.987 --> 03:11:27.215]  When they find out who their legislators are on the committee, call their legislators and tell them to support this HCR 13.
[03:11:27.215 --> 03:11:32.139]  And I've also got a bill out there, House Bill 361, to reject the REAL ID Act.
[03:11:32.139 --> 03:11:33.220]  Those both go in
[03:11:34.201 --> 03:11:35.203]  Pretty close together.
[03:11:35.203 --> 03:11:42.313]  The real IDX, another tank for Big Brother to start watching us and controlling us and tracking our every movement.
[03:11:42.313 --> 03:11:46.399]  So those two bills are ones I'm working on today.
[03:11:47.984 --> 03:11:50.787]  Well, you know, people want solutions, this is it.
[03:11:50.787 --> 03:12:01.718]  This is the remedy in the Constitution, next to the cartridge box, is the states, and I hope you don't have to go to that, for the states to say no and stand up and declare their sovereignty.
[03:12:01.718 --> 03:12:06.002]  And, you know, we're now, as you said, I said that earlier, hours ago, this is the big crossroads.
[03:12:06.002 --> 03:12:09.405]  I totally agree with you, and the good news is the bad news.
[03:12:10.106 --> 03:12:11.226]  And I'll take the bad first.
[03:12:11.226 --> 03:12:13.227]  The bad news is they've taken the gloves off.
[03:12:13.227 --> 03:12:25.190]  They're openly announcing world government FEMA camps, forced compulsory service, national goon squads, carbon taxes that will shut down what's left of our industry, open borders, tracking and tracing.
[03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:33.292]  I mean, it was in Bloomberg yesterday that in the stimulus package is the total federalization of health care, where doctors have to be told by the government what treatments they can do.
[03:12:33.292 --> 03:12:38.954]  And in there it says, over 55, it says in the bill, they would deny this before, they said this is the British model.
[03:12:39.774 --> 03:12:42.136]  And we're just going to let old folks go blind.
[03:12:42.136 --> 03:12:43.177]  We're not going to give you the surgery.
[03:12:43.177 --> 03:12:44.718]  We're not going to give you brain surgery.
[03:12:44.718 --> 03:12:45.999]  You're going to have to wait.
[03:12:45.999 --> 03:12:47.920]  The young people will get the health care.
[03:12:47.920 --> 03:12:51.983]  Actual rationing.
[03:12:51.983 --> 03:12:53.504]  So the good news is the bad news.
[03:12:53.504 --> 03:12:58.627]  The bad news is they're out in the open with classic tyranny and corruption and abuse and control.
[03:12:58.627 --> 03:13:01.189]  But that's also the good news because it's so outrageous.
[03:13:01.189 --> 03:13:03.751]  How could we not beat this?
[03:13:03.751 --> 03:13:05.552]  So please speak to that.
[03:13:05.552 --> 03:13:08.855]  And why do you think government is going so hog wild right now?
[03:13:09.491 --> 03:13:20.461]  I think they've been successful in the past in stepping on us, and with that people revolting, I think maybe it is, as they say, time for another revolution here.
[03:13:20.461 --> 03:13:34.634]  We've quietly gone along here until these last, I'm not sure, three or four years, they take away our rights and people kind of go along with it, and now they think that we won't put up any resistance, but then that's why it's so great.
[03:13:35.908 --> 03:13:39.333]  I'm so glad to see so many states stepping forward now.
[03:13:39.333 --> 03:13:45.121]  I think I just feel like they've got the upper hand, which they do have, and they're going to continue with it.
[03:13:45.121 --> 03:13:50.028]  So they feel that the states won't revolt, won't resist.
[03:13:51.021 --> 03:13:58.107]  They've got the people in a state of fear out there that they're not going to have a job or not going to have any money.
[03:13:58.107 --> 03:14:09.336]  And if the federal government gives them a few dollars to put in their pocket, then they'll owe them and they'll be grateful for what they have, not realizing what they've lost in the meantime and getting to that point.
[03:14:10.165 --> 03:14:11.086]  Well, I agree with you.
[03:14:11.086 --> 03:14:18.274]  Ron Paul said a million times, and it's true historically, we could lose our whole economy tomorrow, but if we had liberty, we would rebuild it very quickly.
[03:14:18.274 --> 03:14:21.277]  Liberty is the engine of milk and honey.
[03:14:21.277 --> 03:14:25.021]  It is the engine of a great, free, beautiful society.
[03:14:25.021 --> 03:14:29.546]  Socialism and corruption always devastates everything in its path.
[03:14:30.186 --> 03:14:31.187]  So can you speak to that?
[03:14:31.187 --> 03:14:33.070]  I mean, you talk about your grandchildren and children.
[03:14:33.070 --> 03:14:34.511]  I'm the same with three children.
[03:14:34.511 --> 03:14:40.998]  I mean, I look at them and I'm not worried about the Fed setting me up or demonizing me or, you know, even killing me.
[03:14:40.998 --> 03:14:42.460]  And I've had death threats.
[03:14:42.460 --> 03:14:45.223]  It's like, my God, there's not even a choice here.
[03:14:45.223 --> 03:14:48.967]  I have to fight these people to the bitter end, whatever the cost is.
[03:14:49.968 --> 03:14:56.993]  I am going to the end, and I can see with you and many other reps we're having on, I've never heard this type of commitment from Ron Paul and many others.
[03:14:56.993 --> 03:15:04.318]  There is now a commitment because it's clear our worst ideas on this were correct.
[03:15:04.318 --> 03:15:06.640]  It's even worse than we had thought.
[03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:09.181]  Yeah, you mention a good point there.
[03:15:09.181 --> 03:15:15.886]  Some of us older people are willing to put up some resistance, and I think they realize that, and that's why they've sort of
[03:15:16.727 --> 03:15:32.756]  Maybe let us alone and they're trying to indoctrinate the young children in the fact that they accept putting a biometric fingerprint or something or accepting a chip implanted in them so they know that that's where they're going to start at a young age, indoctrinating them to be under their control.
[03:15:32.756 --> 03:15:37.498]  And that way they can form their habits from the very beginning.
[03:15:37.498 --> 03:15:45.843]  And that's where our education process has to go to make sure that the young people are aware of the downfalls and the pits that await them out there and get them to
[03:15:46.764 --> 03:15:47.905]  Join our cause.
[03:15:47.905 --> 03:15:56.109]  And we have some younger people getting involved here, and I think they're the ones that realize that their future and their freedoms at stake here.
[03:15:56.109 --> 03:16:00.512]  But then, yeah, this socialism path that we're going down, it's picked up speed here.
[03:16:00.512 --> 03:16:07.736]  In fact, I guess you'd say we're on the downhill slide right now, and it's going to take an all-out effort to get it stopped.
[03:16:07.736 --> 03:16:16.181]  And it's a price that we're going to have to pay to get it stopped out there, because the price in the future will be many times greater than that.
[03:16:16.687 --> 03:16:19.888]  Well, what would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[03:16:19.888 --> 03:16:20.889]  Absolutely.
[03:16:20.889 --> 03:16:44.179]  They're going to give people a few hundred dollar tax credit, but meanwhile, you have trillions to offshore banks and fully federalized everything, and I see these poor fools crying when Obama got elected saying, my problems are all solved, I won't have to worry about bills ever again, and then he went from hope and change, it's all going to be fixed to, it's going to go from a crisis to a catastrophe, do whatever I say or your life's basically over.
[03:16:44.179 --> 03:16:45.900]  Is that not psychological terrorism?
[03:16:46.580 --> 03:16:47.000]  It is.
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:54.221]  You know, they keep saying, gosh, two months ago we had to do this bailout overnight or things were going to collapse.
[03:16:54.221 --> 03:17:01.283]  Well, we're at the point now that it hasn't helped, and right now they're going to say, you know, we've got to get this money, we've got to spend it now.
[03:17:01.283 --> 03:17:11.024]  And people are buying into that, and they're accepting this few dollars as part of their socialism that they're heading down to.
[03:17:11.024 --> 03:17:13.305]  So, you know, I'm really concerned about this.
[03:17:14.406 --> 03:17:17.968]  Government owning our banks and our financial institutions.
[03:17:17.968 --> 03:17:23.670]  I think that is another disaster in the making there, big time.
[03:17:23.670 --> 03:17:29.853]  It's a shame that our country got so out of hand here and we let these powers for so long be in control.
[03:17:30.618 --> 03:17:37.899]  Isn't that what the Founding Fathers and others, like Andrew Jackson, all they did was fight the domination of bankers?
[03:17:37.899 --> 03:17:38.500]  Absolutely.
[03:17:38.500 --> 03:17:48.862]  You go back and you look at the Federal Reserve System and the banks that they had, they realized the dilemma that would happen if the government had a central bank.
[03:17:48.862 --> 03:17:53.483]  And they had one for, what, 20 years, and then they abolished it, and in 1913 they started
[03:17:55.863 --> 03:17:56.303]  We're good to go.
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:29.664]  Well, that's what we're doing, is every Fed location, late last year we went out and protested.
[03:18:29.664 --> 03:18:40.591]  The people are looking past the puppets, the Bushes, the Obamas, to the real power structure, and I think that's why the establishment's racing to finish their new world order, because they know their time is short.
[03:18:40.591 --> 03:18:50.077]  Yeah, but this, I have to admit, sir, years ago I kind of questioned this one world order, but then when you start looking around, it became more involved in it.
[03:18:50.077 --> 03:18:53.039]  You can see what's taking place here, you can see the
[03:18:54.173 --> 03:19:13.821]  European Union and the African Union and the Mideast Union and the North American Union taking place and all at once you see these pieces starting to come together and realize there are a few people that this one world order is quite feasible and it's heading towards that in a too fast a pace to make us comfortable.
[03:19:14.738 --> 03:19:15.099]  You're right.
[03:19:15.099 --> 03:19:29.237]  I want to do a final segment with you, if you can, five more minutes after this break, to talk about, again, on the ground, how we get other states, how you recommend listeners introduce your bill, you know, bring it to state legislators, and Texas is going into session, other states.
[03:19:29.878 --> 03:19:35.062]  Because people are angry, and this is, I think, one of the best solutions.
[03:19:35.062 --> 03:19:40.685]  For those that don't know, this film, The Money Masters, covers the history of the international bankers.
[03:19:40.685 --> 03:19:53.954]  This is what Thomas Jefferson had to say, if the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[03:19:54.855 --> 03:19:59.621]  The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.
[03:19:59.621 --> 03:20:03.606]  Thomas Jefferson.
[03:20:03.606 --> 03:20:06.189]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[03:20:06.189 --> 03:20:09.253]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[03:20:09.253 --> 03:20:13.418]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[03:20:14.170 --> 03:20:16.291]  You know that you need to prepare.
[03:20:16.291 --> 03:20:19.671]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[03:20:19.671 --> 03:20:22.992]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[03:20:22.992 --> 03:20:34.775]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[03:20:34.775 --> 03:20:41.177]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and tobacco.
[03:20:42.768 --> 03:20:46.909]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[03:21:06.112 --> 03:21:11.997]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[03:21:11.997 --> 03:21:17.823]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:21:17.823 --> 03:21:26.791]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933,
[03:21:28.152 --> 03:21:31.613]  Some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[03:21:31.613 --> 03:21:37.215]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[03:21:37.215 --> 03:21:43.877]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[03:21:43.877 --> 03:21:45.157]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:45.157 --> 03:21:46.818]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[03:21:50.339 --> 03:21:53.300]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:53.300 --> 03:21:57.121]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[03:21:57.121 --> 03:21:57.281]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:57.281 --> 03:22:03.543]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:22:03.543 --> 03:22:05.943]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:22:05.943 --> 03:22:08.204]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:22:08.204 --> 03:22:09.784]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:22:09.784 --> 03:22:11.485]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:22:11.485 --> 03:22:14.366]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:22:14.366 --> 03:22:18.447]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:22:18.447 --> 03:22:19.747]  Are you listening?
[03:22:24.532 --> 03:22:27.954]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:22:36.338 --> 03:22:38.959]  How dare you?
[03:22:38.959 --> 03:22:43.840]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:22:43.840 --> 03:22:46.721]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:22:46.721 --> 03:22:53.202]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[03:22:53.202 --> 03:22:56.043]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[03:22:56.043 --> 03:22:58.303]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[03:22:58.303 --> 03:23:00.784]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:23:01.898 --> 03:23:07.401]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[03:23:07.401 --> 03:23:08.201]  and the world.
[03:23:08.201 --> 03:23:12.063]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[03:23:12.063 --> 03:23:18.566]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest in dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[03:23:18.566 --> 03:23:20.587]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[03:23:20.587 --> 03:23:25.809]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[03:23:26.049 --> 03:23:26.309]  I think so.
[03:23:44.199 --> 03:23:46.580]  I was a highway man Along the coach roads I did ride
[03:24:13.587 --> 03:24:15.709]  You know what's exciting?
[03:24:15.709 --> 03:24:28.077]  There's a lot of bad things going on, a lot of tyranny, but tyranny always overreaches, and then it always falls.
[03:24:28.077 --> 03:24:32.741]  Then people get liberty, and then they become complacent again, and it rises again.
[03:24:43.257 --> 03:24:46.160]  But, uh, they're coming out in the open with their world government now.
[03:24:46.160 --> 03:24:48.843]  Their FEMA camps, their NORTHCOM over the states.
[03:24:48.843 --> 03:24:52.628]  They know the threat is the states, that's why NORTHCOM says the governors are abolished.
[03:24:52.628 --> 03:24:56.232]  Federal officers wearing dual hats serving at the pleasure of the president.
[03:24:56.232 --> 03:24:58.654]  NORTHCOM admits they want to use 20,000 combat U.S.
[03:24:58.654 --> 03:24:59.715]  troops against the American people.
[03:25:00.779 --> 03:25:04.561]  They'll stage events to try to bring it in and have people accept it, but they're not going to get away with it.
[03:25:04.561 --> 03:25:06.201]  So the show is on the road.
[03:25:06.201 --> 03:25:08.662]  A lot of people say, let's get the show on the road.
[03:25:08.662 --> 03:25:15.145]  Well, a lot of you talkers are going to have a chance now, because we're desperately here trying to fix things peaceably.
[03:25:15.145 --> 03:25:18.066]  Those of you that want to fight, don't worry, the enemy's going to start fights.
[03:25:18.066 --> 03:25:20.067]  The globalists are going to push it.
[03:25:20.067 --> 03:25:22.408]  And I hope we can avert this.
[03:25:22.408 --> 03:25:25.850]  In closing, Representative Jim Gast introducing this great bill.
[03:25:27.182 --> 03:25:29.564]  They're in the Missouri Statehouse.
[03:25:29.564 --> 03:25:32.726]  We just commend you for what you're doing.
[03:25:32.726 --> 03:25:35.928]  Again, how do people support you?
[03:25:35.928 --> 03:25:39.891]  How do people get this into other state legislatures?
[03:25:39.891 --> 03:25:45.235]  I think one of yours is one of the best pieces of legislation I've seen.
[03:25:45.235 --> 03:25:48.798]  Okay, what they do is just call me here at the Statehouse.
[03:25:48.798 --> 03:25:49.038]  That's 573-751-0246.
[03:25:56.301 --> 03:26:06.945]  Or they can email me at jim.guest at house.mo, m-o dot gov, which stands for Missouri House Government.
[03:26:06.945 --> 03:26:16.648]  And we will forward copies of our legislation to all over the country, to you, to your legislator, so they can start filing in those states they have not filed.
[03:26:16.648 --> 03:26:18.989]  That's how we're doing, sending model legislation around.
[03:26:19.714 --> 03:26:23.137]  You can revamp it to fit your particular state, but you've got to get active.
[03:26:23.137 --> 03:26:31.665]  For those here in Missouri, give me a call, and I'll give you the name of some legislators that you need to work on to getting this voted out of committee.
[03:26:31.665 --> 03:26:36.549]  It's very important to get this out so our voice for freedom here gets heard in Missouri.
[03:26:36.549 --> 03:26:37.350]  Alright, we're in!
[03:26:37.350 --> 03:26:42.795]  So we're probably preaching to those who've probably heard this many times, but you can't say it too often.
[03:26:42.795 --> 03:26:43.716]  It's time to get involved.
[03:26:44.242 --> 03:26:47.063]  We're on a lot of AM and FM stations on the internet in Shorewide.
[03:26:47.063 --> 03:26:48.444]  We have a new lizard every millisecond.
[03:26:48.444 --> 03:26:51.865]  Throw back up on screen his website, his state website.
[03:26:51.865 --> 03:27:00.049]  He's got the number 573-751-0246, or just go get his bill or the New Hampshire bill or others.
[03:27:00.049 --> 03:27:04.411]  Go to your statehouse, go to the Texas Capitol, go say, introduce this.
[03:27:04.411 --> 03:27:10.613]  Bring the articles, mainstream news about FEMA camps and things, and the gun confiscation bills they've got introduced in Congress.
[03:27:10.613 --> 03:27:12.094]  I mean, this is really happening.
[03:27:12.674 --> 03:27:16.095]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the big solutions.
[03:27:16.095 --> 03:27:19.056]  All we talk about is solutions here, and the enemy claims we're not.
[03:27:19.056 --> 03:27:27.219]  In closing, sir, I just want to commend you and the great spirit of Paul Revere and George Washington, what you're doing, and we appreciate you offering to have folks called.
[03:27:27.219 --> 03:27:29.760]  You can consult with them and try to help them with your state or other states.
[03:27:29.760 --> 03:27:33.922]  That's quite a burden you've just taken on, but the other state reps we've had on have made the same offers.
[03:27:34.662 --> 03:27:35.763]  Great patriots.
[03:27:35.763 --> 03:27:38.407]  In closing, you heard my point about at least the show's on the road.
[03:27:38.407 --> 03:27:45.936]  At least it's so out in the open that I'm seeing a gigantic awakening, bigger than anything I've ever seen before.
[03:27:45.936 --> 03:27:53.466]  So, are you seeing a huge firestorm of people starting to get upset and seeing what's happening?
[03:27:54.019 --> 03:27:55.020]  We are, absolutely.
[03:27:55.020 --> 03:28:08.928]  We can make a few calls, send out a few emails, and we can energize a lot of people, patriots around the state, to inundate their legislators with calls and emails on this, and I hope that continues to grow, because it has to be the voice of the people that makes a difference.
[03:28:08.928 --> 03:28:19.515]  And I've got six young students who just walked in my office here, and we're fighting for their freedom and their rights, and I'll be talking to them about this here when we get off the air, so that's who we're working and fighting for.
[03:28:20.658 --> 03:28:21.159]  Absolutely.
[03:28:21.159 --> 03:28:28.025]  I'll let you get to those young people, sir, and it's going to be folks like you and those young students that are going to save this republic for future generations.
[03:28:28.025 --> 03:28:31.789]  Our ancestors fought for us to have this much liberty.
[03:28:31.789 --> 03:28:35.972]  It's our job now to fight to retain any of what was gained in the past.
[03:28:35.972 --> 03:28:36.913]  God bless you.
[03:28:36.913 --> 03:28:38.275]  Representative Gass, take care.
[03:28:38.840 --> 03:28:40.141]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[03:28:40.141 --> 03:28:40.481]  You bet.
[03:28:40.481 --> 03:28:41.642]  What a great guy.
[03:28:41.642 --> 03:28:43.064]  Good to have him on with us.
[03:28:43.064 --> 03:28:44.224]  We're going to continue tomorrow.
[03:28:44.224 --> 03:28:46.326]  We've got two New Hampshire's.
[03:28:46.326 --> 03:28:47.928]  Or is it Friday?
[03:28:47.928 --> 03:28:51.110]  We've got a bunch of state reps coming on.
[03:28:51.110 --> 03:28:58.376]  That guy we had from Washington a couple days ago talking about, he knew about the FEMA camps, martial law.
[03:28:58.376 --> 03:29:01.939]  Yeah, State Rep Shea, Matt Shea.
[03:29:01.939 --> 03:29:06.363]  I mean, it is just a wonderful, he was fully informed, Army officer,
[03:29:08.516 --> 03:29:10.056]  Knows about the gun confiscation.
[03:29:10.056 --> 03:29:11.457]  Knows about the New World Order.
[03:29:11.457 --> 03:29:13.837]  Knows about PDD-51.
[03:29:13.837 --> 03:29:16.678]  And the enemy has just announced all this.
[03:29:16.678 --> 03:29:19.439]  Because they know the general dumbed-down public is scared.
[03:29:19.439 --> 03:29:21.739]  And it's going, give me a job, give me my paycheck.
[03:29:21.739 --> 03:29:24.360]  And Obama's like, oh, I'm going to save you.
[03:29:24.360 --> 03:29:25.720]  We have this video clip coming up.
[03:29:25.720 --> 03:29:27.301]  It is the sickest thing I've ever seen.
[03:29:27.301 --> 03:29:29.441]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers will be able to see it.
[03:29:29.441 --> 03:29:31.642]  Or folks at Rip It to the Four Winds on the web later.
[03:29:31.642 --> 03:29:33.783]  Live listeners will be able to hear the audio.
[03:29:33.783 --> 03:29:34.863]  Coming up, a final
[03:29:36.038 --> 03:29:46.500]  Twenty-seven minutes left when we get back, and we're going to take some phone calls and cover some other news, so opening the phones right now, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:29:46.500 --> 03:29:51.901]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[03:29:51.901 --> 03:29:55.842]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.842 --> 03:30:03.984]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.984 --> 03:30:05.964]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[03:30:12.028 --> 03:30:14.149]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[03:30:14.149 --> 03:30:18.151]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[03:30:18.151 --> 03:30:22.132]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[03:30:22.132 --> 03:30:29.716]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[03:30:29.716 --> 03:30:30.916]  Need something more?
[03:30:30.916 --> 03:30:34.518]  The Stinger keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[03:30:35.026 --> 03:30:43.689]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival spy and tactical gear.

[03:31:01.994 --> 03:31:08.759]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:31:08.759 --> 03:31:11.401]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:31:11.401 --> 03:31:12.942]  But who is the enemy?
[03:31:12.942 --> 03:31:13.742]  Bin Laden.
[03:31:13.742 --> 03:31:14.703]  This is his ammo.
[03:31:14.703 --> 03:31:16.124]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:31:16.124 --> 03:31:18.105]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:31:18.105 --> 03:31:25.250]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:31:25.250 --> 03:31:25.751]  Some U.S.
[03:31:25.751 --> 03:31:31.395]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:31:32.075 --> 03:31:35.598]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:31:35.598 --> 03:31:37.740]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:32:01.929 --> 03:32:05.390]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:32:05.390 --> 03:32:09.170]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:32:09.170 --> 03:32:15.471]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[03:32:15.471 --> 03:32:20.112]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[03:32:20.112 --> 03:32:26.113]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:32:26.113 --> 03:32:29.534]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:32:29.534 --> 03:32:31.454]  Run sump pumps, short-wave radios,
[03:32:31.894 --> 03:32:32.494]  We're good.
[03:33:14.996 --> 03:33:39.475]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears the hole
[03:33:41.650 --> 03:34:03.746]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[03:34:03.746 --> 03:34:05.748]  My sweetest friend
[03:34:08.554 --> 03:34:21.592]  Everyone I know goes away in the end And you could have it all
[03:34:38.499 --> 03:34:41.263]  Obama's gonna make you hurt.
[03:34:41.263 --> 03:34:43.226]  He's here to betray you.
[03:34:43.226 --> 03:34:46.330]  Very, very wicked.
[03:34:46.330 --> 03:34:49.454]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[03:34:52.284 --> 03:34:54.585]  Where Barack Obama has these people.
[03:34:54.585 --> 03:34:56.907]  Now first he tells them he's going to fix everything.
[03:34:56.907 --> 03:35:01.369]  As soon as he gets in, the war is going to end, the torture is going to end, the lobbyists are going to end.
[03:35:01.369 --> 03:35:02.590]  He lied about all of that.
[03:35:02.590 --> 03:35:10.615]  Now it's 16 months, 24 months in Iraq, beefing up troops, expanding troops in the Middle East and Central Asia.
[03:35:10.615 --> 03:35:18.759]  Rahm Emanuel saying they want to nuke Iran, his chief of staff, who's an open foreign intelligence officer of another country.
[03:35:18.759 --> 03:35:19.800]  All of this is happening.
[03:35:22.219 --> 03:35:29.845]  He shifts from hope and change to, we're not going to have a crisis, we're going to have a catastrophe, do whatever I say, let the foreign banks completely take over.
[03:35:29.845 --> 03:35:32.287]  Now, this is all over the news.
[03:35:32.287 --> 03:35:34.749]  Every time you watch Obama in one of these town halls, this is all that happens.
[03:35:34.749 --> 03:35:41.074]  These poor, good people, being led by this Judas Goat, who's bringing in total tyranny.
[03:35:41.074 --> 03:35:43.436]  FEMA camps, everything happening.
[03:35:43.436 --> 03:35:45.318]  National drafts, everything being announced.
[03:35:46.834 --> 03:35:49.935]  And they're trying to coat this evil with this Obama-mania.
[03:35:49.935 --> 03:35:51.716]  This is such a corporate fraud.
[03:35:51.716 --> 03:35:55.637]  Let's go ahead and play this saddening clip.
[03:35:55.637 --> 03:35:58.298]  This young lady's been waiting very patiently.
[03:35:58.298 --> 03:36:04.261]  And she's just been standing there and making me look all guilty.
[03:36:04.261 --> 03:36:07.562]  So, go ahead.
[03:36:07.562 --> 03:36:09.963]  Here, you've got the microphone right behind you.
[03:36:09.963 --> 03:36:10.843]  Thank you very much.
[03:36:10.843 --> 03:36:12.384]  I first want to say... Hit pause.
[03:36:13.925 --> 03:36:14.526]  Back it up.
[03:36:14.526 --> 03:36:26.499]  Watching his body language, I don't think Obama, he's evil, he's proud, he's into power, but if you really watch him, he had that Freudian slip the other day where he said, you know, we gotta get money out of the banks, I mean the people.
[03:36:26.499 --> 03:36:33.807]  You can see him, oh this woman over here, she's making me feel guilty, and you can see him, he's not even acting, he is feeling guilty.
[03:36:36.141 --> 03:36:39.363]  Because he's basically slitting this woman's throat for the New World Order.
[03:36:39.363 --> 03:36:40.663]  And he's doing it while like a little dog.
[03:36:40.663 --> 03:36:55.331]  It's like your dog looking up at you, and you take a gun, and it's smiling at you, and it's licking, you know, it's licking its lips for that one dinner, and you just... That's basically what he's doing to this poor lady, like it's a, like it's a little dog, just, just a poor little trusting person.
[03:36:55.331 --> 03:36:57.092]  Go ahead and go back to it.
[03:36:57.092 --> 03:36:59.453]  Here, have you got the microphone right behind you?
[03:36:59.453 --> 03:37:00.354]  Thank you very much.
[03:37:00.354 --> 03:37:04.836]  I first want to say, I respect you, and I'm so grateful for you.
[03:37:04.836 --> 03:37:05.136]  Thank you.
[03:37:05.549 --> 03:37:07.651]  I believe in prayers.
[03:37:07.651 --> 03:37:08.671]  I appreciate that.
[03:37:08.671 --> 03:37:12.694]  I have an urgent need.
[03:37:12.694 --> 03:37:14.456]  Unemployment and homelessness.
[03:37:14.456 --> 03:37:17.858]  A very small vehicle for my family and I to live in.
[03:37:17.858 --> 03:37:19.600]  We need urgent.
[03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:23.703]  And our housing authorities have two years waiting lists.
[03:37:23.703 --> 03:37:27.466]  We need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to.
[03:37:27.466 --> 03:37:30.948]  We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom.
[03:37:30.948 --> 03:37:32.429]  Please help.
[03:37:32.429 --> 03:37:34.171]  Well, listen, what's your name?
[03:37:35.658 --> 03:37:36.618]  What's your name?
[03:37:36.618 --> 03:37:38.259]  It's Henrietta Hughes.
[03:37:38.259 --> 03:37:38.779]  Okay, Ms.
[03:37:38.779 --> 03:37:39.319]  Hughes.
[03:37:39.319 --> 03:37:48.001]  Well, we're going to do everything we can to help you, but there are a lot of people like you, and we're going to do everything we can.
[03:37:48.001 --> 03:37:49.061]  All right?
[03:37:49.061 --> 03:37:51.922]  I'll have my staff talk to you after the time-out.
[03:37:51.922 --> 03:37:52.322]  All right?
[03:37:52.322 --> 03:37:52.702]  All right.
[03:37:58.752 --> 03:38:00.594]  And then it cuts to, you wanna play another clip?
[03:38:00.594 --> 03:38:02.215]  Alright, what's the question?
[03:38:18.997 --> 03:38:26.461]  And, okay, I've been at the same job, which is McDonald's, for four and a half years because of the fact that I can't find another job.
[03:38:26.461 --> 03:38:38.627]  Now, with the fact that I've been there for as long as I've been there, do you have any plan or any idea of making one that has been there for a long time receive any better benefits than what they've already received?
[03:38:38.627 --> 03:38:40.068]  Well, I tell you what.
[03:38:40.068 --> 03:38:43.310]  First of all, a couple things I'd like to say.
[03:38:43.310 --> 03:38:43.850]  Number one,
[03:38:44.938 --> 03:39:01.928]  The fact that you are working, as hard as you're working, at a job that I know doesn't always pay as well as some other jobs, I think that's a source of pride for you, that shows that you're doing the right thing.
[03:39:01.928 --> 03:39:12.154]  Now, the second thing is, is that you will actually benefit from the tax breaks that we're talking about, so you'll be able to keep a little bit of extra money, because we're going to offset your payroll tax.
[03:39:12.154 --> 03:39:12.755]  That's going to help.
[03:39:14.278 --> 03:39:27.501]  Oh, I don't, I assume that you're not getting health care through your job and so one of the things that we want to do is reform the health care system so that you will have access to health care in your time.
[03:39:27.501 --> 03:39:28.701]  Hit pause.
[03:39:28.701 --> 03:39:33.382]  In the subsection, that old lady he was just talking to, she won't get health care.
[03:39:33.382 --> 03:39:37.383]  I read the quotes Bloomberg yesterday of the people pushing the bill and what's in there.
[03:39:37.383 --> 03:39:40.103]  It says, well if you're going blind and you're old, you're going to have to just go blind.
[03:39:40.103 --> 03:39:41.424]  That's what's supposed to happen.
[03:39:41.424 --> 03:39:43.064]  Only the young people get health care.
[03:39:43.956 --> 03:39:47.797]  And what they're doing is playing the young off against the old as if everybody couldn't have it.
[03:39:47.797 --> 03:39:49.058]  The bankers weren't stealing everything.
[03:39:49.058 --> 03:39:51.279]  And they're taking over health care.
[03:39:51.279 --> 03:39:54.840]  So you got this guy, oh, just I'm begging you, oh Lord, like he's God.
[03:39:54.840 --> 03:39:55.620]  Oh, save me.
[03:39:55.620 --> 03:40:02.563]  I mean, just they have put their total faith in this guy and we know he's betraying them with the international banks.
[03:40:02.563 --> 03:40:07.485]  We know they're openly setting up a global bank to tax the industry that's left and the companies that are left.
[03:40:07.485 --> 03:40:10.126]  We know he said get ready for austerity, get ready for tough times.
[03:40:10.126 --> 03:40:12.527]  He told that old lady, there's a lot of people in your position, man.
[03:40:14.039 --> 03:40:14.939]  She's basically homeless.
[03:40:14.939 --> 03:40:15.259]  You heard her.
[03:40:15.259 --> 03:40:17.160]  I don't even have a bathroom or a kitchen.
[03:40:17.160 --> 03:40:21.061]  And it's gonna get worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.
[03:40:21.061 --> 03:40:22.641]  Let's go back to it.
[03:40:22.641 --> 03:40:26.642]  Of course, now it better be a good one.
[03:40:26.642 --> 03:40:27.882]  Go ahead.
[03:40:27.882 --> 03:40:30.002]  Oh, it's such a blessing to see you, Mr. President.
[03:40:30.002 --> 03:40:31.683]  Thank you for taking time out of your day!
[03:40:31.683 --> 03:40:32.723]  Alright, that's enough.
[03:40:32.723 --> 03:40:34.363]  Oh, gracious God, thank you so much.
[03:40:34.363 --> 03:40:36.624]  Or you can cut it up to the end if you want.
[03:40:36.624 --> 03:40:37.004]  It's just...
[03:40:41.061 --> 03:40:41.802]  It's just horrible.
[03:40:41.802 --> 03:40:44.684]  It's absolutely horrific to see this happening.
[03:40:44.684 --> 03:40:46.386]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[03:40:46.386 --> 03:40:48.728]  Let's talk to John in Ohio first, because he disagrees.
[03:40:48.728 --> 03:40:50.970]  Okay, John, you're up first.
[03:40:50.970 --> 03:40:53.492]  Yeah, you know, I always have to tell you where I'm coming from.
[03:40:53.492 --> 03:41:05.642]  You know, I've publicized your videos on national radio, and I support, and I'm usually inspired by what you say, but on other occasions, horrified.
[03:41:05.642 --> 03:41:08.845]  And I think in some ways you're very contradictory
[03:41:09.900 --> 03:41:21.284]  In terms of believing the most extreme fascist elements of the military-industrial complex propaganda concerning communism and socialism.
[03:41:21.284 --> 03:41:24.245]  I know you know better because sometimes you ambivalent.
[03:41:24.245 --> 03:41:30.467]  And the Newsweek claiming that this is socialism when they know it's exactly the opposite of socialism.
[03:41:30.467 --> 03:41:32.547]  It's the marriage of the government... John, stop!
[03:41:32.547 --> 03:41:32.707]  Stop!
[03:41:32.707 --> 03:41:34.808]  I'm going to let you talk, but I want you to stop.
[03:41:36.516 --> 03:41:40.739]  There is no socialism, there is no communism, there is no fascism.
[03:41:40.739 --> 03:41:49.284]  There's tyranny that always comes through big government because corrupt people will get control of it and use it to rob from people, because men aren't angels.
[03:41:49.284 --> 03:41:50.325]  And there's liberty.
[03:41:50.325 --> 03:41:53.727]  Now we can debate what will bring liberty, but it's decentralization, local control.
[03:41:56.073 --> 03:41:57.495]  Of course, stop, stop.
[03:41:57.495 --> 03:42:04.823]  Of course I said the Newsweek headline where the red states and the blue states are shaking hands and it says we're all socialists now.
[03:42:04.823 --> 03:42:06.825]  Of course this isn't socialism.
[03:42:08.345 --> 03:42:12.487]  And of course this isn't true capitalism with these foreign offshore banks stealing and robbing.
[03:42:12.487 --> 03:42:13.448]  This is looting.
[03:42:13.448 --> 03:42:15.028]  This is piracy.
[03:42:15.028 --> 03:42:24.393]  And so they're going to give literally about 2% of the money to the poor people while taking their jobs and making them dependent and give 98% to the foreign banks.
[03:42:24.393 --> 03:42:25.774]  So it's not socialism.
[03:42:25.774 --> 03:42:27.995]  You're right about that.
[03:42:27.995 --> 03:42:31.137]  But what we have is also not what you call capitalism.
[03:42:31.137 --> 03:42:32.958]  This is crony capitalism.
[03:42:32.958 --> 03:42:35.439]  Robbing, stealing, whatever you want to call it.
[03:42:36.647 --> 03:42:42.229]  So you're saying, you know, that I'm putting out right-wing fascist information.
[03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:44.069]  Notice that both parties do the same thing.
[03:42:44.069 --> 03:42:44.929]  You know what?
[03:42:44.929 --> 03:42:48.130]  You just don't get it, sir, because you believe the left-right paradigm.
[03:42:48.130 --> 03:42:48.970]  Go ahead and make your point.
[03:42:48.970 --> 03:42:50.111]  I'll shut up.
[03:42:50.111 --> 03:42:50.951]  I don't believe that.
[03:42:50.951 --> 03:42:56.833]  You know, even before you were criticizing Obama for being a fascist, I was doing it.
[03:42:56.833 --> 03:43:01.274]  So I'm not in that Democrat-Republican paradigm.
[03:43:01.274 --> 03:43:05.135]  It's right-wing, disguised right-wing, and undisguised right-wing.
[03:43:05.135 --> 03:43:05.915]  It's not left-right.
[03:43:06.663 --> 03:43:34.516]  And some of the people that I've heard you on today, now, you know, Jack McClam says some important things about the war and Tillman and the rest of it, but he comes out and he says that these people are communists, that anyone who's in the elite, who have been involved in some of the most anti-Soviet, anti-communist operations,
[03:43:34.949 --> 03:43:37.991]  That is going to discredit, I think, much of the wonderful things you're doing.
[03:43:37.991 --> 03:43:41.853]  I think some of the people in Hollywood are fearful.
[03:43:41.853 --> 03:43:49.036]  Others may be embarrassed, like Jesse Ventura, for instance, when you had this man on from Glenn Spence.
[03:43:49.036 --> 03:43:55.360]  I believe that many of these people are absolutely neocons in their attitude towards war and the rest of it.
[03:43:55.360 --> 03:43:56.420]  I've heard many of them.
[03:43:56.420 --> 03:44:00.202]  They are total supporters of neoconism.
[03:44:00.202 --> 03:44:03.284]  Larry Flatt, he says very good things about keeping your gun rights.
[03:44:03.660 --> 03:44:11.144]  At the same time, he made the comment that he supports the paramilitary desk squads in Guatemala that kill over a million people.
[03:44:11.144 --> 03:44:11.864]  Let me stop you.
[03:44:11.864 --> 03:44:13.925]  Let me stop you.
[03:44:13.925 --> 03:44:18.288]  We are very proud of the Second Amendment issue because it's the only real gun lobby we got, sir.
[03:44:18.288 --> 03:44:23.330]  You know, you can't judge me by everything my guests have said or done, but let's just expand on here.
[03:44:26.257 --> 03:44:28.518]  Did the Soviets allow citizens to own guns?
[03:44:28.518 --> 03:44:31.240]  Did the communist Chinese allow them to own guns?
[03:44:31.240 --> 03:44:35.021]  Look at the fruits of what you call communism.
[03:44:35.021 --> 03:44:38.583]  Now, if we had a bunch of angels running things, could communism work?
[03:44:38.583 --> 03:44:40.504]  No, because that's not how humans operate.
[03:44:40.504 --> 03:44:42.885]  We want to be different.
[03:44:42.885 --> 03:44:45.927]  We want to identify as different people.
[03:44:45.927 --> 03:44:48.748]  Look, it's a philosophical divide.
[03:44:48.748 --> 03:44:49.589]  I'm against torture.
[03:44:49.589 --> 03:44:50.489]  I'm against more wars.
[03:44:50.489 --> 03:44:52.570]  I'm against drafts.
[03:44:52.570 --> 03:44:54.091]  I'm against police state.
[03:44:54.091 --> 03:44:55.172]  I'm against federal control.
[03:44:56.403 --> 03:44:58.885]  You get rid of those, the New World Order falls apart.
[03:44:58.885 --> 03:45:04.070]  You know, see, I'm not a fan of Fidel Castro.
[03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:06.732]  I'm not a fan of Barack Obama or George W. Bush.
[03:45:06.732 --> 03:45:09.915]  I understand that it's not Iran good, U.S.
[03:45:09.915 --> 03:45:14.299]  bad, U.S., you know, good, Iran bad.
[03:45:14.299 --> 03:45:16.560]  It's the nature of man and corruption.
[03:45:16.560 --> 03:45:17.942]  Now, who's the big empire?
[03:45:17.942 --> 03:45:18.842]  The New World Order.
[03:45:18.842 --> 03:45:19.583]  Who are we facing?
[03:45:19.583 --> 03:45:21.245]  The New World Order.
[03:45:21.245 --> 03:45:23.587]  Look, I'll give you one more minute and I've got to get to the other callers.
[03:45:23.587 --> 03:45:23.827]  Go ahead.
[03:45:24.352 --> 03:45:37.336]  Well, it seems like three or four times a day you've got to bring up, and I'm not a particular brief for the deformed version of communism in the Soviet Union or China.
[03:45:37.336 --> 03:45:44.639]  I don't believe they had real communism, but I believe we're subjected to massive lies, massive exaggerations about what happened there.
[03:45:44.639 --> 03:45:47.980]  If you'll check on Google, lies concerning the Soviet Union,
[03:45:48.325 --> 03:45:56.968]  You'll find that many of these things that we believe about the carnage and the rest of it, the numbers of people killed, were concocted by Nazis, Nazis, Goebbels.
[03:45:56.968 --> 03:46:04.390]  Hey China, listen up, sir, sir, China says Mao killed 80 million people.
[03:46:04.390 --> 03:46:06.651]  The official numbers in the West are 60.
[03:46:06.651 --> 03:46:09.032]  Are you saying that didn't happen under Mao?
[03:46:09.032 --> 03:46:15.254]  You know, the mortal enemies of the new regime in China and Russia were the mortal enemies of the former regime.
[03:46:15.254 --> 03:46:17.835]  They will say anything because they actually
[03:46:18.483 --> 03:46:26.326]  For instance, Nielsen actually brought tanks and troops up and killed the old guard in their own Duma Parliament, the elected people.
[03:46:26.326 --> 03:46:32.589]  So to believe the new regime, which was the mortal enemy of the former regime, is not any kind of... Let me ask you this.
[03:46:32.589 --> 03:46:34.890]  What's your view of Putin?
[03:46:34.890 --> 03:46:39.892]  Putin is... I believe he's a nationalist.
[03:46:39.892 --> 03:46:42.493]  He's tried to reverse some of the
[03:46:43.138 --> 03:46:45.840]  A total stooging for the U.S.
[03:46:45.840 --> 03:46:49.241]  military-industrial complex under Yeltsin.
[03:46:49.241 --> 03:46:52.643]  But he has his own abuses, of course he does.
[03:46:52.643 --> 03:47:03.849]  But at the same time, he's resisting, I think, some of the policies of the United States military-industrial complex, which I think is good to that limited extent.
[03:47:03.849 --> 03:47:04.950]  That's what I believe about him.
[03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:08.012]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[03:47:08.012 --> 03:47:11.073]  Let's go ahead and... Who's up next here?
[03:47:11.073 --> 03:47:12.274]  My call list just refreshed.
[03:47:13.635 --> 03:47:15.176]  Elliot in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:47:15.176 --> 03:47:18.178]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[03:47:18.178 --> 03:47:20.860]  Good.
[03:47:20.860 --> 03:47:25.443]  So, I got a question and then I got an idea for a solution.
[03:47:25.443 --> 03:47:36.210]  My question is, let's just say everything like, let's just say it is the worst case scenario, everything crashes and Mad Max scenario happens.
[03:47:36.210 --> 03:47:37.931]  What, in your opinion,
[03:47:38.547 --> 03:47:40.031]  Do we do as patriots?
[03:47:40.031 --> 03:47:47.387]  If we are prepared, we got the guns, the gold, the water, uh, hemispheric water generators and all the food and all that.
[03:47:47.387 --> 03:47:48.670]  Where do we start from there?
[03:47:49.409 --> 03:47:54.612]  Well, first we have to wait while they let everything break down so then people beg for total tyranny.
[03:47:54.612 --> 03:47:56.453]  I mean, they plan to let it all fall apart.
[03:47:56.453 --> 03:47:57.894]  It looks like they're going to do this.
[03:47:57.894 --> 03:48:00.896]  So then after six months, a year, they come in and people are begging for it.
[03:48:00.896 --> 03:48:06.038]  You have to be waiting for that next phase to not be re-educated, to not go to the FEMA camp, to not go along with them.
[03:48:06.038 --> 03:48:17.285]  And if enough people say no, to whatever extent, whatever means necessary, then the whole thing will fail and then we can reorganize at the state level and then reconvene the republic.
[03:48:18.912 --> 03:48:30.138]  You know, we need organizations now at the state level, led by state representatives and others, who talk openly about the New World Order, who say they're bankrupting things by design, that the states need to organize now against the globalists.
[03:48:30.138 --> 03:48:34.621]  That message has to go out now, and then the globalists may stop imploding the economy.
[03:48:34.621 --> 03:48:36.302]  They could stop it right now.
[03:48:36.302 --> 03:48:39.084]  They've destroyed commerce, they can say everything was fine, everything would be fine.
[03:48:39.084 --> 03:48:41.045]  Because it's fiat.
[03:48:41.045 --> 03:48:46.588]  So, we have to explain to people that A, the globalists are doing this by design, to bring in world government, which they admit they're doing now, no more debating it.
[03:48:47.295 --> 03:48:47.975]  Right, okay.
[03:48:47.975 --> 03:48:55.738]  So my solution is, like, I'm in college right now at the University of Cincinnati, and for all of you out in college, you know, in college that are listening to this show,
[03:49:12.481 --> 03:49:15.842]  I'm pretty sure every college usually has a newspaper.
[03:49:15.842 --> 03:49:24.645]  Try to get in on the newspaper or send in an article to the newspaper so the journalists can disseminate that info out to the entire college.
[03:49:24.645 --> 03:49:25.705]  Or don't count on them.
[03:49:25.705 --> 03:49:28.186]  Start your own online student newspaper.
[03:49:28.186 --> 03:49:30.407]  Get a few writers and pass flyers out.
[03:49:30.407 --> 03:49:33.568]  You'll have more visits in the school newspaper in a week.
[03:49:33.568 --> 03:49:35.028]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:49:35.028 --> 03:49:36.549]  And I'm not taking a lot of my friends.
[03:49:36.549 --> 03:49:38.430]  A lot of my friends, I've been talking to them for years.
[03:49:38.430 --> 03:49:39.550]  They're finally waking up.
[03:49:40.003 --> 03:49:42.584]  And they're loving State's taking back their sovereignty.
[03:49:42.584 --> 03:49:47.387]  I've already got like about five guys coming to me next week when we go to City Hall.
[03:49:47.387 --> 03:49:48.948]  We're going to go to the Council.
[03:49:48.948 --> 03:49:50.629]  We're going to present this legislation.
[03:49:50.629 --> 03:49:51.169]  Exactly!
[03:49:51.169 --> 03:49:54.271]  Don't go get drunk at the bar and chase women.
[03:49:54.271 --> 03:50:03.016]  Go get the smart women out there and have them join you and go down to the City Council and speak about these issues and read executive orders to them and just create such a buzz everywhere.
[03:50:03.016 --> 03:50:04.036]  You'll be truly alive.
[03:50:04.036 --> 03:50:04.717]  Good to hear from you.
[03:50:06.049 --> 03:50:08.951]  We're going to come back and take some calls in the final segment.
[03:50:08.951 --> 03:50:16.335]  I did want to tell listeners out there about some of our great sponsors like SurvivalistSeeds.com.

[03:52:01.744 --> 03:52:03.705]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:52:03.705 --> 03:52:07.328]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:52:07.328 --> 03:52:09.770]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:52:09.770 --> 03:52:12.812]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:52:12.812 --> 03:52:14.693]  It is essential that patriots worldwide

[03:52:22.797 --> 03:52:28.001]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[03:53:38.725 --> 03:53:41.527]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable.
[03:53:41.687 --> 03:53:42.348]  Federal Agents!
[03:53:42.348 --> 03:53:43.008]  We are armed!
[03:54:05.025 --> 03:54:10.087]  I got a message to the government, like every day.
[03:54:30.248 --> 03:54:33.902]  I watch, see them, and call them all suckers.
[03:54:33.902 --> 03:54:35.890]  They warning me about Osama over there.
[03:54:40.163 --> 03:54:42.926]  Alright, final segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:42.926 --> 03:54:45.288]  Gonna jam in some more of these phone calls.
[03:54:45.288 --> 03:54:45.848]  Oh, wait a minute!
[03:54:45.848 --> 03:54:48.371]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Canada.
[03:54:48.371 --> 03:54:50.052]  You're on the air, welcome.
[03:54:50.052 --> 03:54:50.793]  How are you, Allard?
[03:54:50.793 --> 03:54:53.055]  Good, we're fighting devil state mind control.
[03:55:07.003 --> 03:55:07.884]  No doubt, no doubt.
[03:55:07.884 --> 03:55:08.745]  Is it your birthday today?
[03:55:08.745 --> 03:55:09.746]  Happy birthday.
[03:55:09.746 --> 03:55:10.927]  Sure is.
[03:55:10.927 --> 03:55:11.248]  Thank you.
[03:55:11.248 --> 03:55:11.869]  Right on, right on.
[03:55:11.869 --> 03:55:14.271]  A couple questions for you and a few statements.
[03:55:14.271 --> 03:55:20.138]  Alex, I just want to commend you on the work that you're doing, not only for the United States, but also up here in Canada.
[03:55:20.138 --> 03:55:24.923]  I mean, like, this is something that's not only limited to the United States, it's limited to Canada as well.
[03:55:24.923 --> 03:55:28.187]  We're tied in a lot of ways, that's for sure.
[03:55:28.740 --> 03:55:36.783]  A lot of things that you have mentioned, you know, like on your films, even with your black helicopters, for example, that's happening up here in Calgary, Alberta.
[03:55:36.783 --> 03:55:40.264]  That's all to condition you for military occupation.
[03:55:40.264 --> 03:55:41.164]  There's no doubt about it.
[03:55:41.164 --> 03:55:42.344]  There's no question about it.
[03:55:42.344 --> 03:55:43.885]  The deals are signed to use U.S.
[03:55:43.885 --> 03:55:46.046]  troops in Canada and Canadian troops here.
[03:55:46.046 --> 03:55:47.146]  It's in your mainstream news now.
[03:55:48.526 --> 03:55:49.487]  A couple questions, Alex.
[03:55:49.487 --> 03:55:51.528]  Do you know of any affiliates up in Canada?
[03:55:51.528 --> 03:55:55.350]  Obviously, like, I mean... No, we're on no AM or FM's in Canada.
[03:55:55.350 --> 03:55:56.371]  It'd be great to get some.
[03:55:56.371 --> 03:55:58.152]  Call local stations.
[03:55:58.152 --> 03:56:01.514]  God, for mom and pops, the corporate owns won't put us on.
[03:56:01.514 --> 03:56:02.595]  And get them to put us on up there.
[03:56:02.595 --> 03:56:04.155]  That's up to you.
[03:56:04.155 --> 03:56:05.696]  Well, that's for sure.
[03:56:05.696 --> 03:56:15.762]  We're going to need... We need a lot more support in Canada because you mentioned a couple weeks ago that Canadians are very nice people and they have absolutely no idea about the control that they're under.
[03:56:17.338 --> 03:56:21.381]  Since that statement, I went and I read the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada.
[03:56:21.381 --> 03:56:22.701]  And then I went and I re-read the U.S.
[03:56:22.701 --> 03:56:24.162]  Constitution.
[03:56:24.162 --> 03:56:31.647]  And I'll tell you right now, at any point in time, I would give up my Canadian citizenship to become an American for the Constitution.
[03:56:31.647 --> 03:56:32.908]  That's much better.
[03:56:32.908 --> 03:56:34.469]  I mean, the Queen has the final power.
[03:56:34.469 --> 03:56:35.049]  We're out of time.
[03:56:35.049 --> 03:56:35.770]  I appreciate your call.
[03:56:35.770 --> 03:56:37.631]  I'm going to try to jam one more in here.
[03:56:39.266 --> 03:56:41.408]  Tyranny is on the march, so is liberty.
[03:56:41.408 --> 03:56:42.728]  That is the bottom line.
[03:56:42.728 --> 03:56:45.490]  And I have Canadians emailing me saying, it's not as bad as you say here.
[03:56:45.490 --> 03:56:47.932]  Baloney, it's bad everywhere.
[03:56:47.932 --> 03:56:50.114]  Tyler in Texas, last caller we have time for.
[03:56:50.114 --> 03:56:51.315]  Sorry Rob, Greg and others.
[03:56:51.315 --> 03:56:52.475]  Go ahead Tyler.
[03:56:52.475 --> 03:56:53.856]  Alex, happy birthday.
[03:56:53.856 --> 03:56:54.297]  Thank you sir.
[03:56:54.297 --> 03:56:56.999]  Alright, I've got a couple things to say.
[03:56:56.999 --> 03:57:00.261]  As far as those clips you played earlier of Obama giving that kiss to the homeless lady.
[03:57:00.785 --> 03:57:02.846]  Yeah, I thought that was ridiculous when I saw that live.
[03:57:02.846 --> 03:57:09.790]  He doesn't even take care of his own family, his own aunts that live in squalor and his own half-brothers.
[03:57:09.790 --> 03:57:11.691]  That is degenerate.
[03:57:11.691 --> 03:57:12.872]  And then one more thing.
[03:57:12.872 --> 03:57:17.434]  Yeah, I know you were saying clergy being used in time for martial law and stuff like that.
[03:57:17.434 --> 03:57:23.357]  There's a church up the street, a big message board like, you know, on the side of the road that thousands of people see every day.
[03:57:23.357 --> 03:57:26.279]  In big letters it says, you have the right to submit.
[03:57:26.886 --> 03:57:28.967]  It's like, couldn't believe it.
[03:57:28.967 --> 03:57:34.469]  They're being paid by FEMA, at least 26,000 of them now on record, to teach them.
[03:57:34.469 --> 03:57:41.452]  And if you went to the sermons, you look on the sermon list, it'll say a few weeks what's coming up, and you need to go and even record it.
[03:57:41.452 --> 03:57:45.273]  And they'll say, it's good to turn your guns in, it's of the Lord.
[03:57:45.273 --> 03:57:47.754]  I mean, that's how creepy this is.
[03:57:47.754 --> 03:57:50.075]  The government's not paying to have them say that for nothing.
[03:57:53.217 --> 03:57:54.118]  Yeah, outstanding.
[03:57:54.118 --> 03:57:54.778]  I don't know.
[03:57:54.778 --> 03:57:56.819]  What's the name of the church?
[03:57:56.819 --> 03:57:58.780]  Uh, I'm in Austin, by the way.
[03:57:58.780 --> 03:57:59.921]  It's off Bee Cave.
[03:57:59.921 --> 03:58:01.782]  I think it's Lake Hills.
[03:58:01.782 --> 03:58:03.543]  Right off Bee Cave in Cuernavaca.
[03:58:03.543 --> 03:58:10.247]  Why don't you take a photo of it, email it to Aaron with two A's at InfoWars.com, Joey V at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:10.247 --> 03:58:11.027]  We'll post it.
[03:58:11.027 --> 03:58:11.848]  We need your help.
[03:58:11.848 --> 03:58:13.969]  We're going to try to create sections.
[03:58:13.969 --> 03:58:14.949]  The Prison Planet Forum.
[03:58:14.949 --> 03:58:16.330]  Post it there.
[03:58:16.330 --> 03:58:18.671]  Okay?
[03:58:18.671 --> 03:58:19.432]  I appreciate it.
[03:58:19.432 --> 03:58:21.153]  We need your help with the InfoWars.
[03:58:22.403 --> 03:58:23.963]  We had a bunch of guests on today.
[03:58:23.963 --> 03:58:26.264]  It was just absolutely jam-packed.
[03:58:26.264 --> 03:58:31.505]  I don't have time to tell you all the guests that were on, but it was Jack McClam, Sheriff Richard Mack, State Rep.
[03:58:31.505 --> 03:58:33.565]  George Humphrey popped in there in the first hour.
[03:58:33.565 --> 03:58:34.785]  That's coming up right now.
[03:58:34.785 --> 03:58:36.966]  Key Transmission restarts right now.
[03:58:36.966 --> 03:58:40.106]  OnePlace, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com on our sites.
[03:58:40.106 --> 03:58:40.826]  The OnePlace.
[03:58:40.826 --> 03:58:43.407]  God bless you.
[03:58:43.407 --> 03:58:46.928]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.928 --> 03:58:49.088]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.937 --> 03:58:53.618]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.618 --> 03:58:58.381]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.381 --> 03:59:01.322]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.322 --> 03:59:04.364]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.364 --> 03:59:07.986]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[03:59:08.166 --> 03:59:13.689]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.689 --> 03:59:20.673]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.673 --> 03:59:23.635]  And they do it at almost half the cost of any food's grocery prices.
[03:59:23.955 --> 03:59:24.395]  We're good to go!
